<HEAD>COMMODORE BYRON's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD, In 1764, 1765, and 1766.</HEAD>
<P>HIS pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty having formed a de&s;ign of pro&s;ecuting the di&s;covery of countries in the South Seas, was plea&s;ed, in the year 1764, to give orders for the carrying this de&s;ign into execution: in con&s;equence of which, the Dolphin &s;hip of war and the Tamar frigate were fitted, manned, and victualled for this expedition.</P>
<P>Mr. Byron was commander in chief, and Captain Mouat had the honour of command|ing the frigate under him. They &s;ailed from the Downs on the 21&s;t of June, 1764, but the Dolphin running a-ground, &s;he was put into Plymouth Dock and examined: &s;he had how|ever &s;u&s;tained no injury, and on the 3d of July the Commodore hoi&s;ted his broad pendant, and &s;ailed in pro&s;ecution of his voyage. On the 30th they anchored in the road of Fonchiale, at the i&s;land of Madeira; the Governor of which &s;aluted the Captain with 11 guns, and the compliment was returned. They &s;ailed on the 19th, and on the 21&s;t were in &s;ight of Palma, one of the Canary I&s;lands. Their wa|ter having become foul and &s;tinking, they pu|rified
<PB N="2" REF="4">
it, by forcing a &s;tream of air through it, by means of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">nd of ventilator con&s;tructed for that purpo&s;e. On the 27th and 28th they &s;aw the Canary I&s;lands, and anchored in the bay of Port Praya on the 30th.&mdash;Having taken in water, and purcha&s;ed &s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ions, they &s;ail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, for fear of the tornadoes, which are very common on this coa&s;t from Augu&s;t till November.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the crew had purcha&s;ed monkies, lean goats, and fowls, in exchange for their old jackets, &s;hirts, &amp;c. It had been remarked before, and was now again ob&s;erved, that no fi&s;h would come near the &s;hip, which was at|tributed to her being &s;heathed with copper; this was a mort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">fying circum&s;tance, as there were immen&s;e numbers of fi&s;h within &s;ight.</P>
<P>On the 13th of September they came to an anchor in the road of Rio de Janeiro, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, when the Commodore paid a vi&s;it to the Governor, who received him in &s;tate, being attended by &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction, and having many officers, and a Cap|tain's guard under arms before the palace. Fifteen guns were fired in honour of the Eng|li&s;h flag; and the Governor afterwards re|turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Commodore's vi&s;it on board the Dolphin. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">y of the people on board the Tamar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">gings were provided for them on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, where they &s;oon recovered; but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Dolphin kept their health,
<PB N="3" REF="5">
through the plentiful u&s;e of fre&s;h meat and greens.</P>
<P>While the &s;hip lay in this harbour, the Por|tugue&s;e enticed away nine of the crew of the Tamar, and five from the Dolphin. The for|mer were recovered, by a party &s;ent after them in the night; but the Commodore could never learn where his men were &s;ecreted. This prac|tice of kidnapping the Engli&s;h tars is here car|ried on with impunity; and when all other methods fail, the poor fellows are generally made drunk, and then &s;ent up the country, till the &s;hip to which they belong is &s;ailed. They weighed anchor on the 16th of October, and on the 22d the Commodore informed the crew that they were not bound, as they thought, directly to the Ea&s;t Indies, but on a voyage to make di&s;coveries; and that, on their behaving well, the Lords of the Admiralty had ordered them double pay, and other emoluments. They were tran&s;ported with this news, declared their willingne&s;s to &s;erve their country, and promi&s;ed obedience to the orders of the Commodore. On the 29th they encountered &s;o violent a &s;torm, that they were obliged to throw four guns overboard: it continued very tempe&s;tu|ous all night, but dying away in the morning, they made &s;ail, and, in 35 degrees 50 minutes &s;outh latitude, found the weather mo&s;t intole|rably cold, though it was now the latter end of October, and November in that climate an|&s;wers
<PB N="4" REF="6">
to May in England. The &s;ailors now repented the having bartered their old cloaths for eatables; but they were &s;oon re-furni&s;hed with the &s;lops that were on board.</P>
<P>The Commodore, on the 2d of November, delivered their commi&s;&s;ions to his officers, after they had taken the cu&s;tomary oath. They now beheld va&s;t numbers of pintadoes, and other birds, in flocks about the &s;hip. Ob&s;erving the colour of the water to be changed, they &s;tood in for land on the 11th of this month, and found ground at the depth of 45 fathom. The next day the men on the foreca&s;tle called out, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, <Q REND="inline">"Land right a-head."</Q> The Commodore looked forward, and &s;aw what he thought an i&s;land, compo&s;ed of two hills, and land joining to it, which ran far to the &s;outh-ea&s;t; but in the end this proved to be only a fog-bank, which vani&s;hed on a &s;ud|den. The&s;e deceptions are not unfrequent: not long &s;ince the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el made oath, that he had &s;een an i&s;land, and trees growing on it, between Newfoundland and the we&s;t coa&s;t of Ireland; in con&s;equence of which &s;ome &s;hips were &s;ent in &s;earch of it, but it could ne|ver be found.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 13th the wind &s;hift|ed, the &s;ky grew black to windward, and a &s;trange noi&s;e was heard, re&s;embling the roar|ing of the &s;ea on a &s;hallow coa&s;t. Hundreds of birds were ob&s;erved flying from the &s;torm,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and &s;hrieking through dreadful apprehen&s;ion. At length it reached the &s;hip before &s;he was prepared for it, and laid her on her &s;ide. The fir&s;t Lieutenant was beat down by the main &s;heet, by which &s;ome of his teeth were knock|ed out, and he was otherwi&s;e terribly brui&s;ed. The main-&s;ail of the Tamar was &s;plit; but as &s;he was to leeward of the Dolphin, &s;he had more time to prepare for the threatened &s;torm. The wind continued violent all night, but abated in the morning, when the &s;ea was ob&s;erved to be co|vered with a &s;mall red fi&s;h, like cray-fi&s;h, great numbers of which were catched by the &s;hip's crew.</P>
<P>On the 16th they &s;teered for Cape Blanco, &s;haping their cour&s;e agreeable to the chart of it laid down in An&s;on's Voyage. On the 17th they &s;aw the Cape, and for two days &s;truggled hard to reach Port De&s;ire; but the de&s;cription given of it in Narborough's Voyage is &s;o perplex|ed, that they were much at a lo&s;s. They &s;tood into a bay &s;outh of the Cape, but could find no port. On the 20th they &s;aw Penguin I&s;land, and as Port De&s;ire was &s;aid to be a few leagues north-we&s;t of it, a boat was &s;ent out, which found it. In the&s;e &s;eas there were thou&s;ands of &s;eals and penguins near the &s;hip. On the 21&s;t they entered the harbour of Port De&s;ire, and the Commodore in his boat, attended by two other boats, went to &s;ound it. Mr. Byron land|ed, and found the country all one continued
<PB N="6" REF="8">
down, having neither &s;hrubs or trees. They had a &s;ight of four bea&s;ts, near 13 hands high, and in &s;hape like a deer, which they took to be guanicoes. The Commodore having returned to his boat, went higher up the harbour, to an i&s;land abounding with &s;eals, more than 50 of which they killed, &s;ome of them exceeding the &s;ize of an ordinary bullock. They like|wi&s;e killed a variety of birds, one with a head like an eagle, with a large comb on it, and a white ruff, like a lady's tippet, round the neck; the feathers on the back were black, and of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite poli&s;h; the legs were large and &s;trong, with talons &s;omewhat like the eagle; the wings being extended, mea&s;ured no le&s;s than 12 feet from their extremities.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t the Tamar &s;ailed into the har|bour with the ri&s;ing of the tide; but the Dol|phin waiting for a wind, ran on &s;hore, where &s;he remained all night, and the next day, in very tempe&s;tuous weather. On the 23d they &s;aw the track of a tyger, and &s;everal other bea&s;ts, and found a ne&s;t of o&s;triches eggs, which proved to be good eating. On the 24th the &s;hips were both properly moored in the harbour, where the water ri&s;es no le&s;s than 27 feet at &s;pring tides.</P>
<P>The Commodore went on &s;hore this day, and &s;hot a hare weighing 26 pounds, and &s;aw &s;eve|ral others as large as fawns. On the 25th he landed again, and found the barrel of an old
<PB N="7" REF="9">
mu&s;quet, with the King's broad arrow on it, and an old oar of a &s;ingular form. The mu&s;|quet-barrel was &s;o decayed, that it would crum|ble to du&s;t with the touch. The&s;e things, it is probable, were left by the crew of the Wa|ger, or, po&s;&s;ibly, by Sir John Narborough.</P>
<P>They here &s;aw the remains of fires, but met with no inhabitants. The only vegetable they found was wild peas. They killed &s;everal wild ducks, and &s;hot a ball through the body of a hare, which ran two miles before he drop|ped: the fle&s;h of this animal is delicious, and as white as &s;now. Two old guanicoes and a fawn were killed by another party; and &s;ome of the former were &s;een of 300 weight.</P>
<P>The &s;kull and bones of a man having been found, were brought on board; as was like|wi&s;e a young guanicoe, which was very beauti|ful, and grew quite tame; but died in a &s;hort time. Happily, on the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th, two &s;prings of tolerable water were found; and on the next day a tun of it was brought on board. The Commodore went again on &s;hore, where &s;uch an immen&s;e number of birds took flight, as ac|tually darkened the &s;ky, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to walk without treading on their eggs. The&s;e eggs the men are, though there were young birds in the greater part of them.</P>
<P>On the 30th &s;ome men being &s;ent on &s;hore for water, two of them, who fir&s;t came to it, &s;aw
<PB N="8" REF="10">
a tyger lying on the ground, who taking no kind of notice of them, they threw &s;tones at him: &s;till, however, they could not provoke his rage; he waited till the re&s;t came up, and then walked lei&s;urely off. The country near this bay abounds with gee&s;e, ducks, widgeon, and &s;ea-pies, be&s;ides &s;everal birds, the names of which are unknown.</P>
<P>On the 5th of December the &s;hips got under &s;ail, and, during that and the following day, had plea&s;ant weather and a fine gale. They now &s;teered for Pepys' I&s;le, which is de&s;cribed as lying in 47 degrees &s;outh latitude. The weather was now very clear, and the &s;hips, by &s;preading from each other, could, between them, command a pro&s;pect of 20 leagues. They thus continued their &s;earch for this &s;uppo&s;ed i&s;land till the 11th of the month, when the Commodore, convinced that there was no &s;uch place, re&s;olved to &s;tand in for the main, to take in wood and water, which began to be much wanted.</P>
<P>Large whales now &s;wam frequently about the &s;hip, and birds flew round them in great num|bers. On the 15th the wind blew a perfect hurricane, before which it would have been &s;afe&s;t to have ran; but the fear of being driven too far from land, while they were in want of water, determined them to endeavour to wea|ther it, which they did till it abated, which was at eight o'clock the next morning. On

the 18th they &s;aw land, which, like that near Port De&s;ire, was of the downy kind without trees. They now ob&s;erved porpoi&s;es, which were milk white, with black &s;pots, pur&s;uing the fi&s;h in the &s;ea, of which there were great numbers.</P>
<P>On the 20th they ran clo&s;e in &s;hore to Cape Virgin Mary; and having ob&s;erved a &s;moke on &s;hore, and a number of guanicoes feeding in the vallies, they came to an anchor. The next day they again &s;ailed, and at length anchored about two miles from the &s;hore, near the place where they had &s;een &s;moke the preceding day. The Commodore ob&s;erved a number of men on hor&s;e-back, riding to and fro, oppo&s;ite the &s;hip, and waving &s;omething white, which he took to be an invitation to land; and as he was anxious to know what people the&s;e were, he went in one boat with a party of men well arm|ed; the fir&s;t Lieutenant with a &s;eparate party following in another. When they came near the &s;hore, they &s;aw a great number of people on hor&s;eback, and &s;ome on foot, the whole amounting, as they judged, to five hundred; who were drawn up on a &s;tony point of land that ran far into the &s;ea. Though the Com|modore did not ob&s;erve that they had any wea|pons, he made &s;igns for them to retreat a little, which they readily did, and kept &s;houting very loud while the crew were landing; which was no &s;ooner done, than they were mu&s;tered on the beach, with their officers at their head.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14">Mr. Byron now advanced alone, but as he approached, the Indians retreated; he there|fore made &s;igns, that one of them &s;hould come forward, which was complied with. The per|&s;on who advanced appeared to be a chief, and was very near &s;even feet in heighth: round one of his eyes was a circle of black paint, and a white circle round the other; the re&s;t of his face was painted in &s;treaks of various colours. He had the &s;kin of a bea&s;t, with the hair in|wards, thrown over his &s;houlders. The Com|modore and the Indian having complimented each other, in language equally unintelligible to either, they walked together towards the main body of the Indians, few of whom were &s;horter than the height abovementioned, and the women were large in proportion. Mr. By|ron made &s;igns for them to &s;it on the ground, which they did, chanting in a mo&s;t &s;erious and melancholy tone. The eyes of any one face were never painted with the &s;ame colours; &s;ome being white and red, &s;ome black and red, and &s;ome black and white: their teeth were white and even; they were all dre&s;&s;ed much alike; but that &s;ome of them wore a &s;ort of boots, having a &s;pur of peaked wood fa&s;tened to each heel.</P>
<P>The Commodore having prevailed on &s;ome, who were &s;till galloping about, to alight and &s;it down with the re&s;t, he di&s;tributed &s;ome white and yellow beads among them, which they ve|ry

<FIGURE>

</FIGURE>
<PB N="11" REF="16">
gladly accepted. He then took a piece of ribband, and giving the end of it into the hands of the fir&s;t Indian, he continued it to the next, and &s;o on as they &s;at, to the end of the ribband. He then cut it with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars between every two of them; and tied each man's &s;hare round his head, which they did not attempt to remove. It was remarked, that though the pre&s;ents were in&s;ufficient to &s;upply them all, no one pre&s;&s;ed forward from the &s;tation a&s;&s;igned him, nor &s;eemed to envy the &s;uperior good for|tune of his neighbour.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e gigantic people, one woman, who was of the large&s;t &s;ize, and mo&s;t di&s;agree|bly painted, had her hair adorned with beads of blue gra&s;s, hanging, in two divi&s;ions, down before her &s;houlders; and &s;he had bracelets of pale gold or bra&s;s, on her arms; but there was no learning how &s;he obtained this finery. One of the men &s;hewed Mr. Byron the bowl of a tobacco pipe, made of red earth, and made &s;igns that he wanted &s;ome tobacco, none of which they had among them. On this the Commodore beckoned to the &s;eamen, who &s;till remained drawn up on the beach, three or four of whom in&s;tantly running forward, the Indians were alarmed, and jumping up in an in&s;tant, were preparing to retire, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, to fetch their arms. Mr. Byron therefore ran and &s;topped the &s;ailors, directing one of them only to come forward, when he had got all the to|bacco
<PB N="12" REF="17">
they could mu&s;ter among them. This re&s;tored peace, and all the Indians re&s;umed their places, except an old man, who &s;ung a long &s;ong to Mr. Byron; at nearly the conclu&s;ion of which Mr. Cumming, the fir&s;t Lieutenant, brought the tobacco. This gentleman, tho' &s;ix feet two inches high, was him&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed at the diminutive figure he cut among the &s;trangers, who were broad and mu&s;cular in pro|portion to their height. The Commodore hav|ing di&s;tributed the tobacco, they made &s;igns for him to ride to their huts; but he intimated, that he mu&s;t return to the &s;hip; on which they &s;at down again, apparently much concerned. Their hor&s;es, though not large, were active, and much under command: their &s;addles were like an Engli&s;h pad, and the bridle was formed of a thong of leather, with the bit made of wood; they had no &s;tirrups, and both men and women rode a&s;tride. When the Commodore left them they kept their &s;eats, not once offer|ing to follow him.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of December they began &s;ailing up the Streight of Magellan, with a view to take in a proper &s;tock of wood and water, as the finding Falkland's I&s;lands was yet a matter of uncertainty. They remarked a &s;ingle In|dian on this &s;hore, who waved his hand to them till he lo&s;t &s;ight of the &s;hip; they likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;everal guanicoes on the hills. On the evening of the 22d &s;ix Indians came on the beach, hal|looing,
<PB N="13" REF="18">
and making &s;igns that they wi&s;hed an acquaintance with the crew; but, as the &s;eamen were fatigued, the Commodore would not &s;end off a boat to them. On the 25th they &s;aw a point of land near St. George's I&s;land, to which Mr. Byron gave the name of PORPOIS POINT.</P>
<P>Having anchored at ten at night, the Com|modore went the next morning in que&s;t of wood and water, plenty of which they found on the point abovementioned. A fine level country lies over the point, the &s;oil of which appeared to be very luxuriant, producing in|numerable flowers of &s;everal kinds, the &s;mell of which was extremely fragrant; there was al&s;o a plenty of good gra&s;s, among which grew peas that were then in blo&s;&s;om. They &s;aw hun|dreds of painted gee&s;e, (&s;o called from their beauty) which were feeding among this variety of &s;weets: they likewi&s;e found an abundance of plants, and wild celery in great quantities. Many Indian wigwams were &s;een, &s;ituated in the woods, near &s;treams of water; the&s;e had been lately occupied, as the fires appeared but ju&s;t burnt out. In a walk of twelve miles they &s;aw no place proper for a boat to land, the &s;ea breaking high on the &s;hore. Mr. Byron re|turned in the evening, and found that &s;ome of the men had been &s;hooting gee&s;e, teal, and &s;nipes, while others had employed them&s;elves, with equal &s;ucce&s;s, in fi&s;hing: the&s;e employ|ments indeed became nece&s;&s;ary, as the men
<PB N="14" REF="19">
could have eaten thrice their allowance, owing to the keen air of the country.</P>
<P>On the 26th they &s;teered for Port Famine, and came to an anchor, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, the next day at noon. In this place they found drift wood enough to have &s;upplied a thou&s;and ve&s;&s;els. The Commodore went four miles up Sedger river, but could proceed no farther, the trees which had fallen acro&s;s the &s;tream im|peding the boat's way; one of the &s;tumps of them having made a hole in her bottom, &s;he was immediately filled with water: but they made &s;hift to get her on &s;hore, and &s;topped the leak, &s;o as to return in her to the mouth of the river. The banks of this &s;tream are furni&s;hed with the noble&s;t trees, &s;ufficient in number to &s;upply ma&s;ts for the whole navy of Great Bri|tain. Some of the&s;e were &s;o large, that four men joined hand in hand could not enclo&s;e them; and, among the re&s;t, the pepper tree was found. The&s;e woods abound in parrots, and other beautiful birds. The quantity of fi&s;h that was daily taken was equal to the &s;up|ply of both the crews; and the Commodore &s;hot as many gee&s;e and ducks as furni&s;hed &s;e|veral tables be&s;ides his own.</P>
<P>While the &s;hips lay at anchor here, Mr. Byron and a party went on &s;hore; but being catched in a violent rain, they &s;topped where &s;ome Indians had left a fire, the wood of which was yet warm; and kindling a fire to dry their
<PB N="15" REF="20">
cloaths, another fire was in&s;tantly made on Terra del Fuego, the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, which they imagined to be a &s;ignal, on a &s;uppo&s;ition they were Indians. The hills were craggy, of an amazing height, and wholly covered with &s;now; but the plains were adorned with flow|ers, equal in fragrance and beauty to tho&s;e in the gardens of England.</P>
<P>The Commodore having ordered a tent to be erected on the borders of a wood, and adjoin|ing to a rivulet, three of the &s;ailors were there &s;tationed to wa&s;h linen, and they laid in the tent. One evening, &s;oon after they had retired to re&s;t, they were awakened by the deep and hollow roarings of &s;ome wild bea&s;ts, which came nearer them every moment. Terrified with apprehen&s;ion, they made and kept up a blazing fire, round which the bea&s;ts walked at a &s;mall di&s;tance till the dawn of the morning, when they retired.</P>
<P>Near where the &s;hips rode at anchor was a hill cleared of wood, which they imagined to have been a Spani&s;h &s;ettlement, mention of which is made in Captain Wallis's Voyage, as will be &s;een in the cour&s;e of this work. Both &s;hips having taken in &s;ufficient wood and water by the 4th of January, 1765, they &s;ailed at four o'clock in the morning, in que&s;t of Falk|land's I&s;lands; but the wind dying away, they were obliged to come to an anchor the day fol|lowing.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="21">On Sunday the 6th they again made &s;ail, and the Commodore, who had been twenty-four hours on deck, retired to &s;leep; but he was &s;oon awakened by the ve&s;&s;el beating on a bank. Happily, at this in&s;tant, it was a perfect calm, &s;o that the ri&s;ing of the tide &s;oon carried the &s;hip &s;afe off again. On the 8th the officer of the watch di&s;covered that the head of the main|ma&s;t was &s;prung, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened in a violent gale &s;ome time before; but effectual methods were immediately taken to repair the damage.</P>
<P>On the 12th they &s;aw land, which was taken for De Wert's I&s;lands, and at the &s;ame time other land to the &s;outh, which was judged to be what is called New I&s;lands in the charts. This land con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of mountainous and barren rocks, on which were great numbers of birds. Seals abound here, and large whales were &s;een &s;pouting round the &s;hip. On the 14th they &s;aw a flat i&s;land, covered with tufts of gra&s;s as large as bu&s;hes; and on the follow|ing day the Commodore &s;ent a boat from each &s;hip, to examine an opening which had the ap|pearance of an harbour; which being di&s;covered, they &s;tood in for it in the afternoon, and found it excellent beyond their mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes. Soon after this they entered another harbour, to which Mr. Byron gave the name of Port Egmont, from the title of the nobleman at that time Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty. This har|bour

is repre&s;ented to be the fine&s;t in the world, and capacious enough to contain the whole navy of England, in full &s;ecurity: there is plenty of fre&s;h water in every part of it; and gee&s;e, ducks, &s;nipes, and other edible birds, abound in &s;uch numbers, that the &s;ailors were tired with eating them. The gee&s;e were knocked down with &s;tones, &s;o that it was no unu&s;ual thing for a boat to bring off &s;ixty or &s;eventy of tho&s;e birds, without the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hooting a &s;ingle one. Seals and penguins abound here; &s;ea lions of a prodigious &s;ize are found on the coa&s;t; and there is plenty of mu&s;cles, cockles, clams, and limpets. The woods produce &s;orrel and wild celery in great abundance.</P>
<P>The Commodore was once unexpectedly at|tacked by a &s;ea lion, and extricated him&s;elf from the impending danger with great diffi|culty: they had many battles with this animal, the killing of one of which was frequently an hour's work for &s;ix men; one of them almo&s;t tore to pieces the Commodore's ma&s;tiff dog, by a &s;ingle bite. The Ma&s;ter having been &s;ent to &s;ound the coa&s;t, four very fierce animals ran after the boat's crew till they were up to their bellies in water; &s;o that they were obliged to put from the &s;hore, as they had no fire-arms in the boat. The next day, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, Mr. Byron and his company &s;aw a &s;ea lion of an enormous &s;ize; and the crew, being well armed, in&s;tantly engaged him. While they were thus
<PB N="18" REF="25">
employed, one of the other animals po&s;ted to|wards them; but a ball being lodged in his body, he was in&s;tantly di&s;patched. Five of the&s;e bea&s;ts were killed this day, in their at|tempts to &s;eize the men, whom they always pur&s;ued the moment they got &s;ight of them. They were of a mixed &s;hape, between a wolf and a fox; mo&s;t like the latter, but of the &s;ize of the former. They burrow in the ground like a fox, feed on &s;eals and penguins, and are very numerous on the coa&s;t. The &s;ailors, in order to be rid of &s;uch di&s;agreeable compani|ons, &s;et fire to the gra&s;s, which burnt &s;o ra|pidly, that the country was all in a blaze for &s;ome days, and the&s;e animals were &s;een running to &s;eek &s;helter from its fury.</P>
<P>While they lay in this harbour the crew breakfa&s;ted on portable &s;oup and wild celery, thickened with oatmeal, which made a very nu|tritive me&s;s. The &s;oil of the i&s;land was a light clay under a black mould. The Commodore thinks this the &s;ame place which, in Cowley's Voyage, is called Pepys' I&s;land; but he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the harbour, and all the adjacent i&s;lands, by the name of FALKLAND'S ISLANDS, for George the Third, King of Great Britain. It is to the honour of the Surgeon of the Ta|mar frigate, that during their &s;tay there, he made a fence of turf near the watering place, round a tract of land, which he planted with
<PB N="19" REF="26">
vegetables, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who may here|after touch at this port.</P>
<P>On Sunday, January the 27th, they left Port Egmont, and the &s;ame day &s;aw a remarkable head-land, which was named CAPE TAMAR; &s;oon after which they pa&s;&s;ed a rock, which Mr. Byron called the EDISTONE, and then &s;ailed be|tween that and a head-land, to which he gave the name of CAPE DOLPHIN. The di&s;tance from Cape Tamar to Cape Dolphin is about eight leagues, and, from its appearance, was called CARLISLE SOUND, though it is &s;ince known to be the northern entrance of the &s;treight between the two principal i&s;lands. The land &s;een during the cour&s;e of this day was all downs, having neither trees nor bu&s;hes, but large tufts of gra&s;s in va|rious places.</P>
<P>Having anchored during the night, they &s;ailed again the next day, when the Commodore gave the name of BERKLEY'S SOUND to a deep &s;ound between the i&s;lands. About four miles to the &s;outhward of the &s;outh point of this &s;ound the &s;ea breaks very high, on &s;ome rocks that appear above water. The coa&s;t now wore a dangerous a&s;pect, rocks and breakers being at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and in all direc|tions; and the country appeared barren and de|&s;olate. The &s;ea now ri&s;ing high, the Commo|dore &s;ailed to the northward, to prevent being driven on a lee-&s;hore. He imagines the whole
<PB N="20" REF="27">
circumference of Falkland's I&s;lands to be little le&s;s than 700 miles.</P>
<P>At eight in the evening they &s;tood to the we&s;tward, and held their cour&s;e till the 6th of February, when they &s;aw, and &s;tood in for, Port De&s;ire, at the mouth of which they came to an anchor, and had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the Flo|rida, a &s;tore-&s;hip, which they had expected from England. On Thur&s;day the Ma&s;ter of the &s;tore|&s;hip went on board the Dolphin, and informed the Commodore of the extreme bad condition of his &s;hip; on which it was re&s;olved to attempt the unloading her in the harbour, though a place very ill calculated for the purpo&s;e. They therefore entered the harbour; but the night proving very tempe&s;tuous, the Tamar and the Florida both made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, having been driven from their moorings up the har|bour. On this and the following night they were both &s;aved from driving on &s;hore; and as the &s;tore-&s;hip was in con&s;tant danger of being lo&s;t, Mr. Byron &s;ent hands on board to a&s;&s;i&s;t in repairing her, and re&s;olved to take her with him into the Streight of Magellan before he unload|ed her. In this harbour the rudder of the Dol|phin was likewi&s;e repaired, there being no tim|ber proper for making her a new one.</P>
<P>On the 13th the Florida put to &s;ea, with or|ders to &s;teer directly for Port Famine; and on the next day &s;he was followed by the Dolphin and Tamar. The three following days they &s;aw

a &s;trange ve&s;&s;el following them, which &s;haped her cour&s;e, and &s;ailed fa&s;ter or &s;lower, exactly as they did, a circum&s;tance that cau&s;ed much &s;peculation. The Commodore being obliged to wait for the Florida, which was far a-&s;tern, ima|gined the &s;tranger would &s;peak with him, and therefore made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions to give her a proper reception. When he came to an anchor the &s;tranger did the &s;ame, four miles to windward of him; but in the morning &s;he was &s;een three leagues to the leeward. She now got under way, and approached the Dolphin; on which the Commodore got eight guns, which were all that could be come at, to one &s;ide of the &s;hip, as he lay at anchor. Neither party hoi&s;ted any colours; but about this time the &s;tore-&s;hip running a-ground, the &s;trange ve&s;&s;el hoi&s;ted French colours, and &s;ent two boats, with an anchor, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. The Commodore now &s;ent a boat from each of his &s;hips to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Florida, with po&s;itive orders not to let the French boats board her; but to acknow|ledge, in a proper manner, the offer of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The&s;e orders were obeyed, and the &s;tore|&s;hip was got off.</P>
<P>They weighed anchor at &s;ix in the evening, and anchored again at eleven; at which time the French ve&s;&s;el did the &s;ame, but in a &s;ituation that &s;hewed her ignorance of the channel they were in.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30">On the 19th they again &s;ailed; and as the French ve&s;&s;el &s;teered after them, Mr. Byron thought they came from Falkland's I&s;lands, where there was then a French &s;ettlement, to take in wood, or that they were on a &s;urvey of the Streight of Magellan, in which they were now &s;ailing. On the 20th they reached Port Famine, when the Dolphin and Tamar having taken as much provi&s;ion out of the &s;tore-&s;hip as they could find room for, the Ma&s;ter received orders to &s;ail for England as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; it being determined to navigate the other &s;hips through the Streight.</P>
<P>On the 25th they pa&s;&s;ed the French &s;hip, which was in a &s;mall cove, and near her a large quantity of wood, which the Commodore had no doubt was intended for their new &s;ettlement. On Mr. Byron's return to England this appeared to be the fact; and that the &s;hip was commanded by Mon&s;. Bougainville, and called the Eagle.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the account of their pa&s;&s;age thro' the Streight of Magellan, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of the names of places, and de&s;criptions of &s;oundings, bearings and di&s;tances, which could not fail of proving unintelligible, if not di&s;gu&s;ting, to the generality of readers. Whatever is really worth the notice of tho&s;e who read either for in&s;truc|tion or entertainment, &s;hall be faithfully recited in the following pages.</P>
<P>The mountains on both &s;ides of the Streight are covered with &s;now from the top to the bottom;
<PB N="23" REF="31">
are &s;teep and craggy, and of a mo&s;t de&s;olate ap|pearance. On the 1&s;t of March two or three canoes of Indians followed the &s;hip, one of which went on board. This canoe was of bark, and wretchedly made: it contained &s;ome men, wo|men, and a boy, who had bows and arrows, which they exchanged for beads and other trin|kets: the cord of the bow was made of the gut of &s;ome bea&s;t dried, and the arrows were formed of a reed, pointed with a green &s;tone. The&s;e people had no other garment than a &s;eal-&s;kin thrown over their &s;houlders, and they made, on the whole, a mo&s;t wretched appearance. When the &s;hip came to an anchor, &s;everal of the In|dians went on board, and gladly accepted &s;ome ribbands, beads, and other trifling matters, with which the Commodore pre&s;ented them. The&s;e people &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on mu&s;cles and berries, &s;ome of the latter of which they gave Mr. By|ron, when he returned their vi&s;it on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Having narrowly e&s;caped the dreadful effects of a &s;torm on the 3d of March, boats were re|peatedly &s;ent out till the 6th, in &s;earch of a pro|per place to anchor in; and at length the Dol|phin was moored in a little bay oppo&s;ite Cape Quod; and the Tamar, which could not work up &s;o far, about &s;ix miles to the ea&s;tward of it. This part of the Streight being only four miles over, its appearance is dreary and de&s;olate be|yond imagination, owing to the prodigious mountains on each &s;ide of it, which ri&s;e above
<PB N="24" REF="32">
the clouds, and are covered with perpetual &s;now. On the 8th they met with a large number of &s;hell-fi&s;h; and on this day the Commodore went up a deep lagoon under a rock, at the head of which was a fine fall of water, and on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it &s;everal &s;mall coves, calculated for the &s;ecure reception of &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden.</P>
<P>On the 12th an officer was &s;ent in a boat, in &s;earch of an harbour; and in two days he re|turned with an account, that there were five bays between the &s;hip and Cape Upright, in any one of which they might anchor &s;ecurely. While this officer was ab&s;ent, he met with &s;ome Indians, who made him a pre&s;ent of a dog, and one of the women having a &s;ucking child, offered to give it him! At this time winter commenced with all its &s;everity, and the hills were &s;oon covered with &s;now. The cold be|came &s;o inten&s;e that the &s;eamen, who&s;e clothes were continually wet, &s;uffered &s;everely: to for|tify them again&s;t this inclemency of weather, the Commodore gave a warm jacket of woollen &s;tuff, called fearnought, to the crews of both &s;hips, officers included.</P>
<P>On the 16th perceiving they lo&s;t ground on every tack, they came to an anchor; but finding the ground to be rocky, they weighed again, and every man on board was on deck the re&s;t of the day and the whole night, during which time the rain poured down on them in unremitting tor|rents. Notwith&s;tanding this ince&s;&s;ant labour,

<FIGURE>
<PB REF="33">

</FIGURE>
<PB N="25" REF="34">
they found, in the morning, that they had been only lo&s;ing way, owing to the rapidity of the current. They were now glad to anchor in the very bay they had left two days before.</P>
<P>As it continued to rain and blow violently for two days longer, the Commodore &s;ent a boat to &s;ound the bay on the north &s;hore; but no an|chorage could be found. On the 20th the ve&s;|&s;el was driven from her moorings, but by heav|ing up the bower-anchor, and carrying out an|other, they &s;oon re&s;tored her to her &s;ituation. After labouring all day on the 21&s;t, they had gained only two miles on the current, when they came to an anchor; but the &s;ea running high, they &s;ailed the day following; and the current now running to the we&s;tward, they made great way, and, in the evening, anchored in a com|modious bay, where the Tamar had arrived be|fore them. It is remarkable that, notwith|&s;tanding the late &s;everity of the weather added to their ince&s;&s;ant labour, the crew retained both health and &s;pirits.</P>
<P>On the 23d they again &s;et &s;ail, and in a few hours had &s;ight of the South Sea, which rolled a prodigious &s;well on them. On the 25th two boats which had been &s;ent in &s;earch of anchor|ing-places, returned with an account, that they had found two, but neither of them very eligi|ble; they, however, made &s;ail the next morn|ing, and at four in the afternoon found them|&s;elves within a mile of the &s;outh &s;hore, which
<PB N="26" REF="35">
the thickne&s;s of the weather prevented their &s;ee|ing &s;ooner; but as there was no place to an|chor in, they &s;tood for the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Be|tween &s;ix and &s;even the Tamar was ordered un|der the &s;tern of the Dolphin, and then directed to keep a-head of her during the night to &s;how lights, and as often as &s;he varied her tack to fire a gun. At &s;even in the evening the wea|ther cleared for a minute, &s;o that they had &s;ight of the north-&s;hore, bearing we&s;t by north, on which they in&s;tantly tacked-about. The wind now blew a perfect hurricane; the rain de&s;|cended in torrents; &s;ome of the &s;ails were torn to rags; and during this tempe&s;tuous night, in which the &s;ea was continually breaking over them, the &s;hips parted company, and were en|compa&s;&s;ed with rocks and breakers: however, they happily weathered the &s;torm, and at &s;even in the morning both &s;hips came to an anchor. They had now been twice within four leagues of Tue&s;day's Bay, at the we&s;tern mouth of the &s;treight, and twice driven ten or twelve leagues back again by &s;torms; &s;o dangerous is the na|vigation of this &s;treight at an improper &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>On the 28th the Tamar narrowly e&s;caped be|ing da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks, by the parting of the cable to her be&s;t bower-anchor. The Dolphin weighed anchor the next morn|ing, and got under &s;ail, which &s;he had no &s;ooner done, than &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s were made on
<PB N="27" REF="36">
board the Tamar, the anchor of which could not be purcha&s;ed. The Dolphin, therefore, &s;tood again into the bay, and &s;ent her the pro|per a&s;&s;i&s;tance, after which they both anchored for the night; a night the mo&s;t dreadful they had yet known. The winds were &s;o violent as perfectly to tear up the &s;ea, and carry it higher than the heads of the ma&s;ts: a dreadful &s;ea rolled over them, and broke again&s;t the rocks with a noi&s;e as loud as thunder. Happily, they did not part their cables, or they mu&s;t have been da&s;hed in pieces again&s;t the&s;e rocks.</P>
<P>On the following day (April 1&s;t) it was al|mo&s;t a perfect calm; but in the evening it rain|ed much, and the wind blew violently: they therefore remained in their &s;tation till the 4th, when the cutter, which had been &s;ent in &s;earch of a proper anchoring-place, returned with an account, of having found &s;uch place to the we&s;t of the north-&s;hore.</P>
<P>The officer who commanded the cutter had met with a party of Indians, who&s;e canoe was of a con&s;truction not ob&s;erved before, being compo&s;ed of planks &s;ewed together. The&s;e Indians had no covering but a piece of &s;eal-&s;kin thrown over their &s;houlders. Their food, which was of the mo&s;t indelicate kind, was eaten raw: one of them tore a piece of &s;tinking whale's blubber with his teeth, and then gave it his companions, who followed his example. One
<PB N="28" REF="37">
of the&s;e Indians ob&s;erving a &s;ailor a&s;leep, cut off a part of his jacket with a &s;harp flint.</P>
<P>The &s;hips &s;oon came to an anchor in the bay which had been di&s;covered, propo&s;ing to take in wood and water. While they remained here, &s;everal of the natives made a fire oppo&s;ite the &s;hip; on which &s;ignals were made for them to come on board; but as they would not, the Commodore went on &s;hore, and gave them &s;ome trifles, which plea&s;ed them highly; he likewi&s;e divided &s;ome bi&s;cuit among them, and was &s;ur|prized to remark, that if a bit of it fell to the ground, not one of them would &s;toop to take it up without his permi&s;&s;ion: &s;ome of the &s;ail|ors being at this time cutting gra&s;s for a few &s;heep which the Commodore had on board, the Indians in&s;tantly ran to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and tearing up the gra&s;s in large quantities, &s;oon filled the boat. On Mr. Byron's return, they followed in their canoe till they came near the &s;hip, at which they gazed with the mo&s;t pro|found a&s;toni&s;hment. Four of them were at length prevailed on to go on board; and the Commodore, with a view to their diver&s;ion, directed one of the mid&s;hipmen to play on the violin, while &s;ome of the &s;eamen danced; the poor Indians were extravagantly delighted; and one of them, to te&s;tify his gratitude, took his canoe, and fetching &s;ome red paint, rubbed it all over the face of the mu&s;ician; nor could the Commodore, but with the utmo&s;t difficulty,
<PB N="29" REF="38">
e&s;cape the like compliment. When they had been diverted for &s;ome hours, it was hinted to them, that they &s;hould go on &s;hore; which they at length did, tho' with evident reluctance.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed from this bay on the 7th, and on the 8th again encountered very bad weather, as it rained and &s;nowed, while the wind blew a hurricane. On the 9th they pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome dan|gerous rocks, which in Narborough's Voyage are called the Judges, and on which the &s;urf beats with prodigious violence. This day, con|trary to expectation, a &s;teady gale at &s;outh-we&s;t carried them at the rate of nine miles an hour, &s;o that by eight in the evening they were 20 leagues from the coa&s;t on which they had en|countered &s;o many perils.</P>
<P>The Commodore recommends it to future navigators, to be at the ea&s;tern entrance of the Streight of Magellan in December; in which ca&s;e he thinks even a fleet of &s;hips might navi|gate it &s;afely in about three weeks. He ob|&s;erves, that the facility with which wood and water are to be obtained; the va&s;t plenty of vegetables on the coa&s;t, and the abundance of fi&s;h which may be almo&s;t every where procured, are advantages highly in favour of this pa&s;&s;age. It is remarkable, that in &s;even weeks and two days, the time they were in pa&s;&s;ing it, not a &s;ingle man was &s;ick of the &s;curvy, or any other di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="39">On the 26th they &s;ailed we&s;tward, bearing away for the I&s;land of Ma&s;afuero, which they were within &s;even leagues of the &s;ame evening. The next day they bore away for the north of the I&s;land, and then lay by for the boats, which had been &s;ent to found the ea&s;tern &s;ide, but could not land for the violence of the &s;urf. The boats returning, brought a number of fine fi&s;h, which had been catched with the hook and line: and the officer reporting, that he had found a bank where they might anchor, and oppo&s;ite to which was plenty of fre&s;h wa|ter; they made &s;ail for this bank, on which they anchored at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning. The boats were now &s;ent out for wood and wa|ter, their crews having put on cork-jackets, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;wimming, and prevent their be|ing brui&s;ed again&s;t the rocks. In the&s;e &s;eas were a great number of very large &s;harks, which were frequently very near the &s;wimmers; but they providential e&s;caped them. One of the&s;e voracious fi&s;h &s;eized a large &s;eal clo&s;e to one of the watering-boats, and devoured it in an in|&s;tant; and the Commodore &s;aw another do the &s;ame, clo&s;e to the &s;tern of the &s;hip. The i&s;land abounds in goats, many of which were killed and &s;ent on board, and they were deemed equal in flavour to the fine&s;t veni&s;on. One of the goats had his right ear &s;lit, &s;o as to make it evident that &s;ome per&s;on had caught him, given him that mark of di&s;tinction, and let him go
<PB N="31" REF="40">
again. Various &s;orts of excellent fi&s;h were now &s;o plenty, that they could catch &s;ufficient to &s;upply the whole crew two days, in a few hours, with hook and line only.</P>
<P>The gunner and one of the &s;eamen, who were, with others, on &s;hore for water, were left behind all night, being afraid to venture in the boat, as the &s;ea ran high. The Commodore being informed of this circum&s;tance, &s;ent them word, that as blowing weather might be expect|ed, the &s;hip might be driven from her moor|ings in the night, in which ca&s;e they would in|fallibly be left behind. This me&s;&s;age being de|livered, the gunner &s;wam to the boat; but the &s;ailor &s;aying, he had rather die a natural death than be drowned, refu&s;ed to make the attempt; and taking a melancholy farewell of his compa|nions, re&s;olved to abide his fate; when, ju&s;t as the boat was going to put off, a mid&s;hipman took the end of a rope in his hand, and &s;wam on &s;hore, where he remon&s;trated with the poor tar on the fooli&s;h re&s;olution he had taken, till having an opportunity of throwing the rope, in which was a running knot, round his body, he called to the boat's crew, who in&s;tantly dragged their companion on board; but he had &s;wallowed &s;o much water that he appeared to be dead. They recovered him, however, by holding up his heels, and on the day following he was perfectly well.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="41">The Commodore now made a promotion among the officers, he appointed captain Mouat, captain of the Dolphin under him, making Mr. Cumming, the fir&s;t lieutenant of the Dol|phin, captain of the Tamar, and advancing &s;ome other inferior officers.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed on the 30th of April, &s;teering in various directions till the 10th of May, on which, and the day following, they &s;aw &s;everal dolphins and bonettas round the &s;hip, and ob|&s;erved a few birds which had a &s;hort beak; all their bodies being white, except the back and the upper part of the wings. They &s;aw &s;everal grampu&s;es the next day, and more of the birds ju&s;t mentioned; from whence they concluded, that they approached &s;ome land. Two re|markable birds, as large as gee&s;e, with white bodies and black legs, and which flew very high, were ob&s;erved on the 16th, from whence it was conjectured, that they had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome main-land, or i&s;lands. On the 22d they &s;aw &s;everal tropic birds, and caught two bonettas; and on the 26th two large birds, the beak and neck of which were white, and all the re&s;t black, flew about the &s;hip. On the 28th two other birds, one black and white, and the other brown and white, would have &s;ettled on the yards, but were intimidated by the working of the &s;hip. For &s;everal days after they &s;aw great numbers of birds, and on the 7th of June they di&s;covered land, being then in fourteen degrees
<PB N="33" REF="42">
five minutes &s;outh latitude, and 144 degrees 58 minutes we&s;t longitude.</P>
<P>The Commodore now &s;teered for a &s;mall i&s;land, the appearance of which was plea&s;ing beyond expre&s;&s;ion, being &s;urrounded by a beach of fine white &s;and, and covered with lofty trees, which extending their &s;hade to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and having no underwood, formed the mo&s;t elegant groves that the imagination can paint an idea of. Several of the natives &s;oon appeared, having long &s;pears in their hands, who made large fires, which were an&s;wered by corre&s;ponding fires on an i&s;land to the wind|ward. A boat was &s;ent to look out for an an|choring-place, but none was to be found. At this time many of the be&s;t hands were confined to their hammocks with the &s;curvy; while tho&s;e who were able to keep the deck, looked and langui&s;hed for tho&s;e re-invigorating delicacies which were unhappily beyond their reach. The &s;hells of turtle were &s;trewed along the &s;hore, and they beheld numbers of cocoa-nuts, to the milk of which fruit the &s;curvy &s;eldom fails to yield. The inhabitants of this i&s;land kept a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip, dancing and &s;houting: they &s;ometimes &s;hook their &s;pears, and then falling backwards, lay motionle&s;s, as if dead, which was under&s;tood to be a threat of de&s;truc|tion to &s;uch as &s;hould pre&s;ume to land. They likewi&s;e fixed two &s;pears in the &s;and, on the top of which were fa&s;tened &s;ome things which
<PB N="34" REF="43">
waved in the air: before the&s;e they kneeled, and appeared as if invoking the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Deity again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed invaders. The Com|modore was tempted, from its very appearance, to &s;ail round the i&s;land; while he was doing which, he again &s;ent out boats to &s;ound; on which the natives made a mo&s;t hideous out-cry; took up and balanced large &s;tones in their hands, and pointed to their &s;pears. The &s;ail|ors, on the contrary, made every po&s;&s;ible &s;ign of friend&s;hip, throwing bread and other things on &s;hore; which they would not touch, but retired to the woods, dragging their canoes after them. This being done, they ran into the water, watching as for an opportunity to drag the boat on &s;hore. The &s;eamen, irritated at this behaviour, would have fired on the In|dians, but were re&s;trained by command of the officer on board.</P>
<P>The crew of the boats having again reported, that no anchorage could be found, the Com|modore proceeded to the other i&s;land, and on the next morning brought to, at three quarters of a mile from the &s;hore. Several other i&s;lands were now &s;een, covered with the cocoa-nut-tree. The natives again ran to the beach, armed with clubs and &s;pears, u&s;ing threatening ge&s;tures. The Commodore fired a cannon-&s;hot over their heads, on which they retreated to the woods. The boats having been again &s;ent out, returned with an account, that no
<PB N="35" REF="44">
landing-place could be found; on which Mr. Byron named this paradi&s;e in appearance, the ISLANDS OF DISAPPOINTMENT. The natives are &s;tout, and well made, very quick runners, and their complexion is that of the deep copper.</P>
<P>Having &s;ailed on the 8th of June, they di&s;|covered an i&s;land on the day following, which laid low, and was covered with various kinds of trees, among which was the cocoa-nut; the i&s;land was &s;urrounded with a rock of red coral. The inhabitants on the coa&s;t having made large fires, as &s;uppo&s;ed to alarm the more inland na|tives, they ran along the &s;hore in multitudes, armed like tho&s;e of the I&s;lands of Di&s;appoint|ment. The ve&s;&s;els now brought to, at a &s;mall inlet, opening into a lake of &s;alt water, which appeared more than two leagues wide. At this place was a little town, under the &s;hade of a grove of cocoa-nut-trees. The &s;hips ad|vancing to the mouth of the inlet, &s;ome hun|dreds of the natives, headed by a kind of of|ficer, who carried a pole, on which was fa&s;ten|ed a piece of mat, ranged them&s;elves up to the wai&s;ts in water, making a hideous noi&s;e, till they were joined by a number of large canoes which came down the lake. At this time two boats were out in &s;earch of &s;oundings, and the crews of them making every po&s;&s;ible &s;ign of friend|&s;hip, &s;ome of the canoes drew towards them, not, indeed, as we hoped, with a peaceable intention, but with a view to haul the boats on
<PB N="36" REF="45">
&s;hore: &s;everal of the natives, leaping from the rocks, &s;wam to the boats; and one of them &s;prang into the Tamar's boat, &s;natched up a &s;eaman's jacket, and in&s;tantly dived from the boat to the &s;hore: another of them laid violent hands on a hat, but lo&s;t his prize through his ignorance, as he pulled it downwards, in&s;tead of lifting it from the head.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed we&s;tward, and &s;oon di&s;co|vered another i&s;land, di&s;tant four leagues. The natives pur&s;ued them in two large double canoes, in each of which were about thirty armed men. At this time the boats were at a con&s;iderable way to leeward of the &s;hips, and were chaced by the canoes; on which the Commodore mak|ing a &s;ignal, the boats turned towards the Indi|ans, who in&s;tantly pulled down their &s;ails, and rowed away with great rapidity: they drove through the violent &s;urf on the &s;hore, and were followed by the boats; when, apprehending the inva&s;ion of their country, they armed them|&s;elves with &s;tones and clubs; on which the boat's crew fired, and killed two or three of them, one of whom died as he was throwing a &s;tone at his enemy, after three balls had gone thro' his body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Horrid, wanton murder!&mdash;If di&s;coveries are to be purcha&s;ed at &s;uch a price, the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere had bet|ter have remained unknown.</NOTE>. This poor fellow dropping clo&s;e to the boats, his body was brought to the &s;hip; but the Indians carried off the re&s;t of their
<PB N="37" REF="46">
companions. The boats carried the two canoes with them, as the trophies of their &s;candalous victory. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els con&s;i&s;ted of planks &s;ewed together, with a &s;trip of tortoi&s;e&s;hell fixed over each &s;eam: they had &s;harp bottoms, and were very narrow; and two of them were fa&s;tened a-long&s;ide each other by two timbers, which left a &s;pace of full &s;ix feet between the canoes: a &s;ail, made of neat matting, pa&s;&s;ed from one ve&s;|&s;el to the other, being fixed to a ma&s;t which was hoi&s;ted in each of them: when they &s;ail, &s;eve|ral men &s;it on the timbers which lay from boat to boat: their cordage appeared to be formed of the outer covering of the cocoa-nut, and was exqui&s;itely well made.</P>
<P>As no refre&s;hments could be obtained, ow|ing to the violence of the &s;urf, the Commodore returned to his former &s;tation at the inlet, and again &s;ent the boats in &s;earch of an anchoring-place. A number of the Indians were on the &s;pot were he had left them, and were loading &s;ome large canoes, mo&s;t probably to attack the boats; on which a &s;hot was fired over their heads, and they in&s;tantly ran away and &s;ecreted them&s;elves. The boats returned in the evening, with a few cocoa-nuts; and in the morning were &s;ent out again, with all the invalids who were able to go in them. The Commodore went on &s;hore this day, and &s;aw many Indian huts, which were co|vered with the branches of the cocoa-nut-tree: they were mean buildings, but finely &s;ituated
<PB N="38" REF="47">
among groves of lofty trees. The men went naked; but &s;ome women were &s;een, who wore a kind of cloth from the wai&s;t to the knee. The &s;hore abounded with coral, and the &s;hells of large pearl oy&s;ters; and 'tis probable a va|luable pearl-fi&s;hery might be e&s;tabli&s;hed here. There were many dogs in the huts, who kept barking con&s;tantly till our adventurers went on board.</P>
<P>The next day the &s;eamen found, in one of the huts, the carved head of a rudder, which had evidently belonged to a Dutch long-boat: they likewi&s;e found a piece of bra&s;s, another of iron, and &s;ome iron tools; but by whom the&s;e things were left is wholly unknown.</P>
<P>The burial-places of the natives were under high trees, near their hou&s;es; and their tombs con&s;i&s;ted of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> laid on perpendicular &s;ide &s;tones, like tho&s;e in the church-yards of England. On the branches which &s;haded the&s;e repo&s;itories hung ba&s;kets of reeds, containing the heads and bones of turtle and other fi&s;h, and near the graves were &s;everal boxes filled with human bones.</P>
<P>The flies on this i&s;land were extremely trou|ble&s;ome, but no venomous creature was &s;een. Parrots and other birds were very plentiful, and they &s;aw &s;ome beautiful doves, &s;o tame as to follow them into the huts of the Indians. The water of the i&s;land is good, and the &s;urface of the ground is almo&s;t covered with &s;curvy-gra&s;s.
<PB N="39" REF="48">
This part of the i&s;land is &s;ituated in 14 degrees 29 minutes &s;outh, and 148 degrees 50 minutes we&s;t.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day, June the 12th, they &s;ailed to another i&s;land, and as they coa&s;ted along it, the natives, armed as tho&s;e of the other i&s;lands, kept even with the &s;hip for &s;ome leagues. They frequently plunged into the &s;ea, or fell on the &s;and, that the &s;urf might break over them, to cool and refre&s;h them&s;elves. The boats being near the &s;hore, the crew made &s;igns that they were in want of water; on which the natives pointed farther along the &s;hore, where, when the boats arrived, they &s;aw a number of hou&s;es, and whither they were followed by the Indians, many more of whom joined them at this place. The boats having got clo&s;e in &s;hore, and the &s;hips laying at a &s;mall di&s;tance, a ve|nerable old man, with a white beard, advanced from the hou&s;es to the beach, attended by a young fellow. Having made a &s;ignal for the other Indians to retire, he came forward to the edge of the water, pre&s;&s;ing his beard to his brea&s;t with one hand, and holding a branch of a tree in the other. He now made a kind of mu&s;ical oration, during which the people in the boat threw him &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents, which he would neither take up, nor permit his attendant to touch, till he had fini&s;hed his harangue, when he walked into the water, and throwing the branch to the boat's crew, he retired, and picked
<PB N="40" REF="49">
up their pre&s;ents. Mo&s;t of the natives having complied with a &s;ign made for them to lay down their arms, one of the Mid&s;hipmen &s;wam a&s;hore; on which they flocked round him, ad|miring his cloaths; as his wai&s;tcoat plea&s;ed them mo&s;t he gave it to them, which he had no &s;ooner done, than one of them untied his cravat and ran away with it. He now thought it time to retreat to the boat, whither &s;everal of the na|tives &s;wam after him; &s;ome bringing each a cocoa-nut, and others fre&s;h water in the nut-&s;hell. The boat's crew had taken with them &s;ome &s;hells of the pearl oy&s;ter, in order to learn of the natives how to procure &s;ome pearls; but they could not po&s;&s;ibly make them comprehend their meaning. This i&s;land is &s;ituated in 14 de|grees 41 minutes &s;outh latitude, and 149 de|grees 15 minutes we&s;t longitude; and both the i&s;lands the Commodore called KING GEORGE'S ISLANDS, in re&s;pect to his Sovereign. In a lake belonging to the la&s;t i&s;land, two or three very large ve&s;&s;els were &s;een, one of which had two ma&s;ts, with proper cordage.</P>
<P>The boats having returned on board, they &s;ailed we&s;tward the &s;ame day; and the next af|ternoon de&s;cried another i&s;land, towards which they immediately &s;ailed, and found that it was well inhabited, and had a fine appearance of verdure; but that a violent &s;urf broke all along the coa&s;t. It lies in 15 degrees &s;outh, and 151
<PB N="41" REF="50">
degrees 53 minutes we&s;t, and received the name of the PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLAND.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed northward. From the va&s;t flocks of birds they had repeatedly &s;een, which always winged their way to the &s;outh, on the approach of evening; and from the i&s;lands being &s;o well peopled, the Commodore con|cluded that there was a chain of i&s;lands leading to a continent, the di&s;covery of which he would certainly have attempted, but the crews of both &s;hips were &s;o unhealthy, as to render it impo&s;|&s;ible for us to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>On Monday, June the 17th, they concluded that land was near, from the multitudes of birds which flocked about the &s;hip; but they &s;aw no land till the 21&s;t, when it was di&s;covered at eight leagues di&s;tance, having the appear|ance of three i&s;lands, with rocks between them. The&s;e i&s;lands abounded with inhabitants, who&s;e dwellings lined the coa&s;t; and the beauty and fertility of the &s;oil, &s;eemed to excel that of any place they had &s;een: but the rocks and break|ers with which it was &s;urrounded, were an in|&s;uperable bar to any attempt at landing. On the night of the 21&s;t all hands were on deck, as it rained hard, and the wind blew violently. Soon after nine o'clock the Tamar fired a gun, and the crew of the Dolphin imagined they &s;aw breakers to leeward; but it proved to be only the undulating reflection of the &s;etting moon on the waters.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51">On the 24th they di&s;covered another i&s;land, which was named the DUKE OF YORK'S ISLAND. A terrible &s;ea breaks round the coa&s;t, but the place it&s;elf had a plea&s;ing appearance. The boats landed with &s;ome difficulty, and brought off a large quantity of cocoa-nuts, which were a great relief to the &s;ick. Thou&s;ands of &s;ea-fowls were found &s;itting on their ne&s;ts in high trees, and were &s;o tame as to be ea&s;ily knocked down, and there were great numbers of land-crabs on the ground. This i&s;land has a large lake in the mid&s;t of it, but has no inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the 29th they &s;ailed northward, with a view to cro&s;s the equinoxial line, and then &s;ail for the Ladrone I&s;lands. On the 2d of July they di&s;covered a low flat i&s;land, abounding with the cocoa-nut and other trees, and affording a mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect. A great number of the natives were &s;een on the beach, many of whom, in above &s;ixty canoes or proas, &s;ailed, and formed a circle round the &s;hips; which having &s;urveyed for a con&s;iderable time, one of the Indians jumped out of his boat, &s;wam to the &s;hip, ran up its &s;ide in a moment, &s;at down on the deck, and began laughing mo&s;t violent|ly: he then ran about the &s;hip, pilfering what|ever he could lay hands on, which was taken from him as fa&s;t as &s;tolen. This man having as many antic tricks as a monkey, was dre&s;&s;ed in a jacket and trow&s;ers, and afforded exqui&s;ite diver&s;ion. He devoured &s;ome bi&s;cuit with great eagerne&s;s,
<PB N="43" REF="52">
and having played the buffoon &s;ome time, made prize of his new dre&s;s, by jumping over the &s;ide of the &s;hip, and &s;wimming to his companions. Several others now &s;wam to the &s;hip, and run|ning up the &s;ide to the gun-room ports, com|mitted &s;ome petty theft, &s;wimming off with their booty with &s;urpri&s;ing expedition. The&s;e Indi|ans are of a bright copper, with regular and chearful features, and are tall and well-made. Their hair, which is long and black, is either tied in three knots, or in a large bunch behind. Their ears were bored, and they certainly had worn heavy ornaments in them, as &s;ome of them were drawn down almo&s;t to their &s;houlders: their ornaments were &s;hells &s;trung together, and worn round the wai&s;t, wri&s;t, and neck; but they were otherwi&s;e naked. One of them, who &s;eem|ed to be of &s;ome rank, wore a &s;tring of human teeth round his wai&s;t. Some of them carried a long &s;pear, the &s;ides of which, for the length of three feet, were &s;tuck with the teeth of the &s;hark, which are as keen as a razor. Some cocoa-nuts being &s;hewn them, and &s;igns made that more were wanted, they endeavoured to &s;teal tho&s;e, in&s;tead of directing where more might be found.</P>
<P>The officers named this place BYRON'S ISLAND, in honour of the Commodore. It lies in 1 de|gree 18 minutes &s;outh latitude, and 173 degrees 46 minutes ea&s;t longitude. They &s;ailed from hence on the 3d of July, on the 21&s;t of which month the men again grew ill of the &s;curvy,
<PB N="44" REF="53">
having eaten up all the cocoa-nuts, which are, perhaps, the be&s;t cure for this di&s;order in the world Several of the people were al&s;o trou|bled with fluxes, owing to the extreme heat of the weather. On the 22d they &s;ailed for the i&s;land of Tinian, being nearly in the latitude of that place; and &s;ix days afterwards they had &s;ight of the i&s;lands Saypan, Tinian, and Ai|guigan, which lie between two and three leagues from each other. At noon, on the 31&s;t, they anchored at the &s;outh-we&s;t end of Tinian, in the &s;ituation where the Centurion had anchored with Commodore An&s;on. The water is &s;o won|derfully clear at this place, that, though 144 feet deep, they could &s;ee the ground.</P>
<P>The Commodore went on &s;hore, where he &s;aw many huts, which had been left the prece|ding year by the Spaniards and Indians. Hav|ing cho&s;en a &s;pot on which to erect tents for the &s;ick, Mr. Byron and his company, with prodigious difficulty, worked their way through the woods, in &s;earch of tho&s;e elegant meadows and lawns, of which &s;o enchanting a picture is given in An&s;on's Voyage: but, to their un|&s;peakable mortification, they found the lawns covered with reeds, in which their legs were entangled, and cut as with whipcord; and the&s;e reeds were, in &s;ome places, higher than their heads, and in none le&s;s than half that height. From head to foot they were covered with flies, which got down their throats as often as they
<PB N="45" REF="54">
opened their mouths. In this excur&s;ion they killed a bull, and then retiring to the tents, which had been erected in their ab&s;ence, they &s;ent a party to fetch home their prize.</P>
<P>The invalids having been brought on &s;hore the preceding day, they, on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, began clearing the well, which Mr. Byron &s;uppo&s;es to be the &s;ame that the Centurion watered at; but he &s;ays the water was bracki&s;h, and full of worms. While they lay here the wind once drove in &s;o vi|olently from the we&s;t, that the &s;hips were obliged to put to &s;ea for a week, to avoid being da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks. The armourer's forge was brought on &s;hore, to repair the iron-work of the &s;hips; and the Commodore had a tent erected; as he was very ill of the &s;curvy. The crew reco|vered apace from the &s;curvy; but many of them were &s;eized with fevers, of whom two died, be|ing the fir&s;t they had lo&s;t &s;ince they left Eng|land. The rains were violent, and almo&s;t per|petual; and the heat &s;o inten&s;e, that the ther|mometer on board the &s;hip generally &s;tood at 86, only 9 degrees le&s;s than the heat of the blood at the human heart. Innumerable in&s;ects tormented them; and they were perpetually in|fe&s;ted by mu&s;quitos in the night, and flies by day. The i&s;land &s;warms al&s;o with black ants, centipieds, and &s;corpions.</P>
<P>Parties were &s;ent out to kill cattle, which, af|ter being ab&s;ent three days and nights, and kil|ling a bullock, had &s;even or eight miles to drag
<PB N="46" REF="55">
it through the woods and lawns, and when i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> arrived, it was commonly fly-blown, and &s;tunk intolerably: add to this, that the extreme toil of this duty brought on fevers, which confined the men to their tents. They killed poultry with ea&s;e; but the heat was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that it would turn green, and &s;warm with maggots, in le&s;s than an hour after it was killed. They kil|led wild hogs that weighed 200 pounds each, which afforded them their chief &s;upply of fre&s;h meat. A negro belonging to the Tamar con|trived a method to en&s;nare the&s;e animals, &s;o that they &s;ent many on board alive, and were thus always certain of having fre&s;h meat both in the &s;hip and on &s;hore.</P>
<P>A &s;pot having been found where cattle were plentiful, a party was &s;ent to kill them, having a tent erected for their u&s;e, and boats were &s;ent daily to bring away what they killed: three of the crew of the Tamar were lo&s;t in this &s;ervice, by the violent breaking of the &s;ea upon the rocks. Bread was now baked every day for the u&s;e of the &s;ick, and, upon the whole, they were well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Saypan is not only larger, but plea&s;anter that Tinian. It is, in a great degree, covered with trees, and abounds with hogs and guanicoes. It is conjectured that the Spaniards, at &s;tated periods, carry on a pearly-fi&s;hery at this i&s;land, as there were evident &s;igns of people
<PB N="47" REF="56">
having been lately there, and large heaps of the oy&s;ter-&s;hells were &s;een.</P>
<P>The Commodore remained at Tinian till the 30th of September, by which time the &s;ick be|ing tolerably well recovered, he weighed anchor, and &s;tood to the northward. This i&s;land pro|duces plenty of cotton and indigo, with cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, guavas, paupaus, &s;our oranges, and limes.</P>
<P>On the 18th of October &s;everal land-birds, apparently much fatigued, flew near the &s;hip; one of which, of the &s;ize of a goo&s;e, re&s;ted on the booms: its legs and beak were black, but every other part white; and the beak was of a mo&s;t mon&s;trous length and thickne&s;s. On the 30th they &s;aw a number of trees and bamboos floating near the ve&s;&s;el, which was then in 23 fathom water. On the 5th of November they came to an anchor off the I&s;land of Timoan, on which Mr. Byron landed the day following. The inhabitants, who are Malays, no &s;ooner &s;aw the boat making for the &s;hore, than many of them came to the beach, each having a dag|ger by his &s;ide, a &s;pear in one hand, and a long knife in the other. The boat's crew, however, made no he&s;itation to land, and bartered a few handkerchiefs for a goat, a kid, and a dozen of fowls.</P>
<P>The Malays are of a copper complexion, well made, but of &s;mall &s;tature. They wore turbans on their heads, and pieces of cloth, fa&s;|tened
<PB N="48" REF="57">
with a &s;ilver cla&s;p, round the wai&s;t; but one old man among them was habited nearly in the Per&s;ian fa&s;hion. Their hou&s;es, which are rai&s;ed on po&s;ts eight feet from the ground, are compo&s;ed of the bamboo, &s;lit, and are very neatly con&s;tructed. The i&s;land produces the cocoa-nut and cabbage-trees in great abund|ance, and there are &s;ome rice grounds on it. While the &s;hips lay at anchor, &s;ome of the in|habitants brought a living animal on board, which had legs like that of a deer, with a body like a hare, which proved to be very fine eat|ing. The crews catched large quantities of fi&s;h in this harbour, from whence they &s;ailed on the 7th of the month.</P>
<P>Nothing worth notice happened till the 14th, when a &s;loop being &s;een at anchor in the har|bour of an I&s;land named Pulo Toupoa, Mr. Byron, having anchored in the &s;ame harbour, and ob&s;erved that the ve&s;&s;el hoi&s;ted Dutch Co|lours, &s;ent an officer on board her, who was re|ceived with great politene&s;s, tea being immedi|ately made for him and his attendants; but he could not make him&s;elf under&s;tood, the crew con&s;i&s;ting entirely of Malays. This ve&s;&s;el, which was made of &s;lit bamboo, had a piece of timber on each quarter, which &s;erved to &s;teer her in&s;tead of a rudder.</P>
<P>The Commodore &s;ailed the following day, and held his cour&s;e till the 19th, when he &s;poke with an Engli&s;h Snow, bound from Bencoolen
<PB N="49" REF="58">
to Malacca and Bengal, in the Ea&s;t India Com|pany's &s;ervice. At this time their bi&s;cuit was filled with worms and rotten, and their beef and pork was &s;tinking. The ma&s;ter of the Snow being apprized of this circum&s;tance, &s;ent Mr. Byron two gallons of arrack, a turtle, twelve fowls, and a &s;heep; which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the half of his &s;tock, and for which he refu&s;ed to accept the &s;lighte&s;t return. They dropped their anchors this day in the road of Sumatra; and on the 27th, came to an anchor in that of Batavia.</P>
<P>Having anchored nearer the town on the fol|lowing day, they fired eleven guns, which were returned; and an Engli&s;h &s;hip from Bombay fired 13 guns in honour of the Commodore.</P>
<P>The Dutch Commodore &s;ent his boat on board the Dolphin, under the command of his cock-&s;wain, who made but a &s;habby appearance. He put &s;everal que&s;tions to Mr. Byron re&s;pecting his voyage and de&s;tination, and took a book from his pocket to write down his an&s;wers, which Mr. Byron con&s;idering as an indignity, de&s;ired him in&s;tantly to leave the &s;hip; which he did not think proper to he&s;itate at doing.</P>
<P>Mr. Byron vi&s;ited the Dutch Commodore at his country hou&s;e, was received with great po|litene&s;s, and told, that he might take a hou&s;e in any part of the city, or be lodged at the ho|tel. Any inhabitant of Batavia permitting a &s;tranger to &s;leep, though but for a &s;ingle night,
<PB N="50" REF="59">
in his hou&s;e, incurs a penalty of 500 dollars; the hotel being the only I cen&s;ed lodging hou&s;e, the Governor appoints the keeper of it, who at this time was a Frenchman. This hotel is the mo&s;t &s;uperb building in the city, having more the air of a palace than an inn. All the &s;treets of Batavia are well di&s;po&s;ed, and having canals running through them, re&s;emble the cities of Holland. The inhabitants are a motley herd of Dutch, Portugue&s;e, Chine&s;e, Per&s;ians, Moors, Malays, Javane&s;e, &amp;c. and their numbers are amazingly great. The Chine&s;e live in a kind of &s;eparate town without the city walls, and deal very largely, having annually ten or twelve ve&s;|&s;els laden from China. The roads, for &s;everal miles round the city, are very wide, and have a canal, &s;haded with trees, running by them, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is broad enough for the navigation of large ve&s;&s;els. Adjoining to this canal are the country-hou&s;es and gardens of the citizens.</P>
<P>The &s;hips remained in this harbour till the 10th of December, when they &s;ailed, being &s;a|luted with eleven guns by the fort, and thirteen by the Dutch Commodore. During their run from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ence to Prince's I&s;land, in the Streight of Surda, they were &s;o abundantly &s;upplied with turtle, by boats from the Java &s;hore, that the common &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lors &s;ub&s;i&s;ted wholly on that fi&s;h. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> at Prince's I&s;land till the 19th, when they &s;ailed for the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="60">On the 10th of February they &s;aw a great &s;moke ari&s;ing from a &s;andy beach, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made by the Hottentots. On the 13th they came to an anchor, and the next morning the Governor &s;ent his coach and &s;ix for the Commodore, and received him with great politene&s;s, offering him the accommoda|tions of the company's hou&s;e in the garden, and the u&s;e of his coach. The Cape is a fine coun|try, &s;ituated in a healthy climate, and abound|ing with various kinds of refre&s;hments. In a paddock adjoining the Company's garden, which is extremely elegant, o&s;triches, zebras, and other curious birds and animals are con|&s;tantly kept. The Commodore frequently gave his men permi&s;&s;ion to go on &s;hore, and they as con&s;tantly returned&mdash;drunk with the Cape wine.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed on the 7th of March, and on the 25th cro&s;&s;ed the equinoctial line. About this time an accident happening to the rudder of the Tamar, and it being impo&s;&s;ible to make a perfect repair of it at &s;ea, the Captain was or|dered to bear away for Antigua; in con&s;equence of which, they parted company on the fir&s;t of April; and the Dolphin, without meeting with any other material occurrence, came to an anchor in the Downs on the 9th of May, 1760, after having been rather above twenty-two months in the circumnavigation of the globe.</P>

<HEAD>CAPTAIN WALLIS's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>SAMUEL WALLIS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> having been ap|pointed to the command of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Dolphin, which was de&s;tined for a Voy|age round the World, he &s;ailed down the river on the 26th of July, and came to an anchor in Plymouth Sound on the 16th of Augu&s;t; three days after which he received &s;ailing orders, and directions to take under his command the Swal|low &s;loop, and Prince Frederick &s;tore &s;hip. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed on the 22d, and on the 7th of September, in the evening, came to an an|chor in the road of Madeira. The next morn|ing Captain Wallis &s;aluted the Governor with 13 guns, and the compliment was returned with an equal number.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed thence on the 12th, after having taken in beef, wine, and onions, as &s;ea-&s;tores. On the 16th, as they were &s;ailing off the I&s;land of Pal|ma, at the rate of eight miles an hour, the wind &s;uddenly died away, &s;o that the ve&s;&s;els lay quite &s;till. On the 20th they catched &s;everal bonettas, out of a great number which &s;urrounded the &s;hip; and this day they &s;aw &s;ome herons flying to the ea&s;tward. The Swallow, which was a bad &s;ailer, parted from the other ve&s;&s;els, in the night between the 21&s;t and 22d, but &s;he joined
<PB N="53" REF="62">
company again on the 24th, within &s;ix leagues of the I&s;le of May. This day the three ve&s;&s;els came to an anchor in Port Praya, in the above-mentioned i&s;land; and the next morning they obtained leave from the commanding officer at the fort, to get water and other nece&s;&s;aries. This being the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on there, and the &s;mall-pox being very fatal, the Captain detained every man on board who had not had that di&s;temper.</P>
<P>They here catched great quantities of fi&s;h, and having procured cattle and water, and found &s;ome wild pur&s;lain that was very refre&s;hing, they &s;ailed on the 28th; and, in the night, &s;aw the burning mountain on the peak of Fuego. Cap|tain Wallis now ordered every man to be fur|ni&s;hed with hook and line, that he might &s;up|ply him&s;elf with fi&s;h; and likewi&s;e, to prevent infection, commanded that no man &s;hould keep his fi&s;h above twenty-four hours. On the 20th they began to &s;erve the crews with oil, all the butter and chee&s;e being con&s;umed; and orders were i&s;&s;ued, that, during the remainder of the voyage, they &s;hould be &s;erved with vinegar and mu&s;tard once a fortnight. On the 22d they judged that they were within 60 degrees of land, from the &s;ight of a great number of birds. Two days after this orders were given for &s;erv|ing the men with brandy, the wine being re|&s;erved for tho&s;e that were ill. On the 27th the Prince Frederick &s;prung a leak, and her crew were at this time &s;o &s;ickly, through the fatigue of
<PB N="54" REF="63">
pumping, and the badne&s;s of their provi&s;ions, that her commander, Lieut Brine, was apprehen|&s;ive he could not keep company much longer, except &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be given him. The Captain &s;ent a carpenter and &s;ix &s;ailors on board, but he was unable to &s;upply her with better pro|vi&s;ions. As the carpenter found he could do little toward &s;topping the leak in the &s;tore-&s;hip, the Dolphin and Swallow compleated their pro|vi&s;ions from her &s;tores, and put on board her the empty oil jars, &s;taves, and iron hoops.</P>
<P>By the 12th of November they were in 30 degrees of &s;outh latitude, when they found the weather &s;o cold as to have recour&s;e to their thick jackets. On the 19th, at eight o'clock at night, they &s;aw a meteor, which flew horizontally from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, leaving a train of light, which made it as bright as at mid-day on the deck. From the 20th to the 22d they &s;aw whales, &s;eals; &s;nipes, plover, and other birds, and &s;ome butterflies. On the 8th of December they &s;aw land, and on the 9th remarked, that the &s;ea appeared coloured, by the immen&s;e quan|tities of red &s;hrimps that &s;urrounded the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 16th, being very near Cape Virgin Mary, they &s;aw &s;everal men riding on the &s;hore, who made &s;igns for them to land. Having come to an anchor, they ob&s;erved that the natives re|mained oppo&s;ite the &s;hip all night, &s;houting aloud, and keeping up large fires. In the morn|ing the Captain went on &s;hore, with a boat's
<PB N="55" REF="64">
crew from each &s;hip, and having made &s;igns for the Indians to &s;it down, he gave them combs, buttons, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, beads, &amp;c. and plea&s;ed the women greatly by the di&s;tribution of &s;ome ribbands. He then intimated that he &s;hould be glad to accept &s;ome guanicoes and o&s;triches, in exchange for bill-hooks and hatchets, which he &s;hewed them; but they were either really or de|&s;ignedly ignorant of his meaning. The talle&s;t among the&s;e people was &s;ix feet &s;even inches, &s;everal others were from one to two inches &s;hort|er; but the general height was from five feet ten to &s;ix feet. They were mu&s;cular and well made, but their hands and feet very &s;mall, in pro|portion to the re&s;t of their bodies. They were dre&s;|&s;ed in the &s;kin of the guanico, with the hairy &s;ide to their bodies; and &s;ome of them wore a &s;quare piece of cloth, made of the hair of the guanico, and a hole being cut to admit the head through, it reached down to the knees: they wore like|wi&s;e a kind of bu&s;kin from the middle of the leg to the in&s;tep, which was al&s;o conveyed un|der the heel, but the re&s;t of the foot was bare: their hair, which was &s;trait and coar&s;e, was tied back with a cotton &s;tring; and their complexion was the dark copper. They rode on hor&s;es about fourteen hands high, and had dogs of the Spa|ni&s;h kind; both men and women rode a&s;tride, and the men were furni&s;hed with wooden &s;purs: &s;ome of the men had their arms painted, the faces of others were variou&s;ly marked, and others
<PB N="56" REF="65">
again had the left eye enclo&s;ed by a painted cir|cle. Their arms were two round &s;tones, en|clo&s;ed with leather, one of which was fa&s;tened at each end of a &s;tring eight feet in length: and one &s;tone being held in the hand, the other was &s;wung round the head with great force for &s;ome time, and then di&s;charged at any mark they cho&s;e to &s;trike. They likewi&s;e catch guanicoes and o&s;triches by means of this cord, which is thrown &s;o, that the weight twi&s;ts round and hampers the legs of the intended prey. Some of them were ob&s;erved to devour the paunch of an o&s;trich raw, having only turned the in&s;ide outwards, and &s;hook off &s;ome of the filth.</P>
<P>The&s;e people, who are great talkers, were often heard to &s;ay <HI>Ca-pi-ta-ne,</HI> on which they were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively addre&s;&s;ed in Portugue&s;e, Spa|ni&s;h, Dutch, and French; but they had no knowledge of either of tho&s;e languages. When they &s;hook hands with any of the crew, they always &s;aid <HI>chevow</HI>; and they were amazingly ready in learning Engli&s;h words, and pronoun|ced the &s;entence <Q REND="inline">"Engli&s;hmen come on &s;hore"</Q> with great facility.</P>
<P>As they &s;eemed de&s;irous of going on board, the Captain took eight of them into the boats, on which they in&s;tantly began &s;inging for joy; but when they came into the &s;hip, they expre&s;|&s;ed no kind of &s;urprize at the novelties they be|held, till a looking-gla&s;s being ob&s;erved, they acted many antic ge&s;tures before it, occa&s;ionally
<PB N="57" REF="66">
walking to and from it, talking with earne&s;tne&s;s, and laughing immoderately. They would drink nothing but water, but they eagerly ate every article of the &s;hip's provi&s;ions. They were highly plea&s;ed with &s;ome turkies and guinea-hens which were on board, nor did the hogs and &s;heep e&s;cape their attention. One of them mak|ing &s;igns that he &s;hould be glad of &s;ome cloaths, the Captain gave him a pair of &s;hoes and buckles, and pre&s;ented the re&s;t with a little bag each, in which he put new &s;ix-pences and halfpence, with a ribband pa&s;&s;ed through a hole in them, to hang round their necks: the remaining contents of the bag were, a looking-gla&s;s, a comb, &s;ome beads, a knife, a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, &s;ome twine, and a few &s;lips of cloth: being offered &s;ome to|bacco, they &s;moked a few minutes, but did not &s;eem to like it. The marines being exerci&s;ed before them, they were terrified at the firing of the mu&s;kets, and one of them falling down, &s;hut his eyes, and lay without motion, as if to intimate that he knew the de&s;tructive nature of tho&s;e weapons.</P>
<P>It was with difficulty that they were at length prevailed on to go on &s;hore; and one of them would not leave the &s;hip till he had &s;ung a long kind of prayer, and even petitioned to &s;tay till evening, by pointing to the &s;un, and then mov|ing his hand round to the we&s;tern horizon. As &s;oon as they were in the boat they began to &s;ing, and did not cea&s;e till they reached the &s;hore,
<PB N="58" REF="67">
where many of their companions pre&s;&s;ed eagerly to be taken into the boat, and were highly af|fronted at being refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>This day they turned into the Streight of Magellan with the flood-tide, and &s;aw many people on hor&s;eback hunting the guanicoes, which ran up the country with prodigious &s;wift|ne&s;s. The natives lighted fires oppo&s;ite the &s;hips, and in the morning about 400 of them, with their hor&s;es feeding near them, were ob&s;erved in a valley. This being the &s;pot where Mr. Byron &s;aw the Patagonians, &s;ome officers were &s;ent towards the &s;hore, but with orders not to land, as the &s;hips were too far off to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. When they came near the land, many of the natives flocked towards them, among whom were women and children, and &s;ome of the very men they had &s;een the pre|ceding day: the&s;e waded towards the boat, fre|quently calling out, <Q REND="inline">"Engli&s;hmen come on &s;hore;"</Q> and were with difficulty re&s;trained from getting into the boat, when they found the crews would not land. Some bread, tobacco, and toys were di&s;tributed, but not an article of provi&s;ions could be obtained in return.</P>
<P>On the 23d the tide was &s;o violent, that the &s;hips were driven three &s;everal ways; but in the evening they were &s;afely anchored. On Chri&s;tmas-day they procured a quantity of ce|lery from Elizabeth I&s;land, which being boiled with portable &s;oup and wheat, the crews break|fa&s;ted
<PB N="59" REF="68">
on it &s;everal days. Many huts were found on this i&s;land, and two dogs were &s;een; but the Indians had quitted it for the pre&s;ent. Many high mountains were ob&s;erved, which, though it was then the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, were, in a great de|gree, covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>On the 26th they anchored in Port Famine Bay, and the &s;ick were &s;ent on &s;hore, where a tent was erected for their reception, as was ano|ther for the accommodation of the &s;ail-makers, and tho&s;e who landed to get wood. On the 28th the empty water-ca&s;ks were landed; and on this day great quantities of fi&s;h were catched, among which were &s;melts. When they arrived here, many of the people were very bad with the &s;curvy; but by the plentiful u&s;e of vegetables, and bathing in the &s;ea, they all recovered in a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>All hands were now employed in repairing and &s;toreing the &s;hips; and thou&s;ands of young trees were carefully taken up with the mould about them, to be carried to Falkland's I&s;lands, which produce no timber.</P>
<P>On the 17th of January, 1765, the Ma&s;ter of the Dolphin, who had been in &s;earch of an|choring-places, returned with an account, that he had found &s;uch as were proper for the pur|po&s;e; and this day the Prince Frederick &s;ailed for Falkland's I&s;lands.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed on the 18th, and came to an an|chor the next day, half a mile from the &s;hore,
<PB N="60" REF="69">
oppo&s;ite a current of fre&s;h water, that falls ra|pidly from the mountains. As a more conve|nient anchoring-place, and at the &s;ame time bet|ter adapted for procuring wood and water, had been di&s;covered, they &s;ailed again the next day, and, on the 23d, came to an anchor in the bay near Cape Gallant, where they catched wild ducks in &s;uch numbers, as to afford them a very &s;ea&s;onable relief. Near this &s;pot are very high mountains, one of which was climbed by the Ma&s;ter of the Swallow, with the hope of get|ting a view of the South Sea; but being di&s;|appointed in his expectation, he erected a py|ramid, and having written the &s;hip's name and the date of the year, he left the &s;ame, with a &s;hilling within the &s;tructure.</P>
<P>On the 24th they &s;aw an animal that was as &s;wift as a deer, and had a cloven foot; but in other re&s;pects it was like an a&s;s. Near this &s;pot the country has a mo&s;t forbidding a&s;pect:&mdash;the mountains on both &s;ides the Streight are of a &s;tupendous height; the lower parts of them are covered with trees, above which a &s;pace is oc|cupied by withered &s;hrubs; higher up are frag|ments of broken rock, and heaps of &s;now; and the tops are totally rude, naked, and de&s;olate.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 28th they &s;aw a great &s;moke on the &s;outhern &s;hore, and another on Prince Rupert's I&s;land; and the next morning &s;ome people being &s;ent on &s;hore for water, they had no &s;ooner landed, than &s;everal of the natives
<PB N="61" REF="70">
came off in three canoes; and, having advanced towards the &s;ailors, made &s;igns of friend&s;hip, which being an&s;wered to their wi&s;h, they &s;houted aloud, and the Engli&s;h &s;houted in return. When the Indians came up they were eating the fle&s;h of &s;eals raw, and were covered with the &s;kins, which &s;tunk intolerably. They had bows, ar|rows, and javelins, the two la&s;t of which were pointed with flint. The&s;e people were rather low of &s;tature, the talle&s;t of them not exceed|ing five feet &s;ix inches, and their complexion was the deep copper colour.</P>
<P>Three of the&s;e people being taken on board the Dolphin, they ate whatever food was of|fered them; but, like the Patagonians, would drink only water:&mdash;like them too, they were highly diverted with a looking-gla&s;s, in which they at fir&s;t looked with a&s;toni&s;hment, till, hav|ing become a little more familiar with it, they &s;miled at its effect; and finding a corre&s;ponding &s;mile from the figure in the gla&s;s, they bur&s;t in|to mo&s;t immoderate fits of laughter.</P>
<P>The Captain going on &s;hore with them, pre|&s;ented &s;ome trinkets to their wives and children, and received &s;ome of their arms, and pieces of mundic, of the kind found in the tin mines of Cornwall. The&s;e Indians went off in canoes, the &s;ails of which were made of the &s;eal-&s;kin.</P>
<P>The &s;hips &s;ailed on the 3d of February, and came to an anchor in York Road on the &s;ame day. The next morning Captain Wallis, with
<PB N="62" REF="71">
a party, went on &s;hore near Batchelor's River, and &s;aw many Indian huts, and &s;everal dogs, which ran away the moment they were noticed: they likewi&s;e &s;aw o&s;triches, and collected vari|ous kinds of fi&s;h and vegetables. There is a cataract near this river, the noi&s;e of which is tremendous, as it falls more than 400 yards, partly over a very &s;teep de&s;cent, and partly in a perpendicular line.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed on the 14th, and came to anchor again the &s;ame day in York Road, after having lo&s;t ground by the contrary winds. The next morning they were driven with &s;uch violence by the current, as to be in momentary expectation of being da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks, from which they were frequently not half the length of the &s;hip; but they were providentially pre&s;erved, and came to an anchor in BUTLER'S BAY, which was &s;o called from the name of one of the mates, who di&s;covered it. They kept this &s;ta|tion till the 20th, when they encountered a mo&s;t violent &s;torm attended with hail and rain, which increa&s;ed till the evening, the &s;ea breaking over the foreca&s;tle upon the quarter-deck; yet, as the cables did not part, they were again won|derfully pre&s;erved from de&s;truction. They re|mained here eight days, taking in wood and water, and repairing the little damage the &s;hip had &s;u&s;tained in the &s;torm. They catched fi&s;h of various kinds, among which were mu&s;cles near &s;ix inches in length; and procured plenty
<PB N="63" REF="72">
of vegetables. The mountains in this neigh|bourhood had the mo&s;t rugged and de&s;olate ap|pearance; but their height could not be a&s;cer|tained, as their heads were lo&s;t in the clouds; and &s;ome of them, on the &s;outhern &s;hore, were &s;o exceedingly de&s;olate, as not to produce even a &s;ingle blade of gra&s;s; while the vallies were equally barren, and almo&s;t covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of March they &s;ailed again, and anchored on the &s;ame day in a bay which they called LION'S COVE, from whence they &s;ailed on Monday; and on the five following days en|countered &s;uch terrible weather, that they had no pro&s;pect before them but that of immediate de&s;truction: and the crew on board the Dolphin were &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that the Swallow could not ride out the &s;torm, that they imagined they &s;aw &s;ome of her hands coming over the rocks to|wards them.</P>
<P>The &s;torm at length &s;ub&s;ided; but the wea|ther being inten&s;ely cold, each of the men was furni&s;hed with a thick jacket, made of the woollen &s;tuff called Fearnought. During a week which they remained at this place, they were at two-thirds allowance, brandy excepted.</P>
<P>On the 15th both &s;hips were &s;afely anchored in a place called SWALLOW HARBOUR, from whence they &s;ailed the next morning; and on the fol|lowing day the Swallow, being driven among breakers, made &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s; but &s;he was happily relieved by a breeze from the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="73">This day the waves ran high, and there was &s;o thick a fog, that they narrowly e&s;caped &s;hipwreck among a number of &s;mall i&s;lands; but the wea|ther clearing up a little in the afternoon, they came &s;afely to an anchor in a bay under Cape Upright.</P>
<P>On the 19th two canoes, having on board &s;everal Indians, came a-long&s;ide the Dolphin, who had with them a quantity of &s;eal's fle&s;h, blubber, and penguins, which they ate without any kind of dre&s;&s;ing. A &s;eaman having catched a fi&s;h bigger than a herring, gave it to one of them, who killed it by a bite near the gills, and in&s;tantly devoured it. The&s;e people would not drink any liquor but water, but they eagerly ate provi&s;ions of any kind, boiled, roa&s;ted, raw, &s;alt, or fre&s;h. Though the weather was very cold, they had no covering but a &s;eal-&s;kin, and even that they did not wear when they were rowing. It was remarked that they had all &s;ore eyes, probably occa&s;ioned by the &s;moke of their fires, and they lived in &s;uch a na&s;ty way that they &s;melt as rank as a fox. They had a kind of javelin, pointed with bone, which they u&s;ed in &s;triking fi&s;h. The Captain pre&s;ented them with a few baubles, with which they departed well &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Twenty-two of the &s;ailors &s;taying one night on an i&s;land, thirty of the natives hurried to their boat, and began to make free with its con|tents; but the &s;ailors had ju&s;t time to hinder
<PB N="65" REF="74">
their depredations, which enraging them, they ran to their canoes, and armed them&s;elves with poles and javelins; but the &s;ailors giving them &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents, peace and harmony were &s;oon re&s;tored.</P>
<P>The 30th of the month proving a fine day, they employed them&s;elves in drying the &s;ails of the &s;hips, which were damaged by having been long wet. Several Indians went on board the next day, and proved to be the people which the boat's crew had &s;een on &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April &s;ome of the natives brought &s;everal of the birds called Race-hor&s;es, which they &s;old to the &s;ailors. The next day eight Indians brought &s;ix of their children on board, whom the Captain gratified with brace|lets and necklaces. The&s;e people were exceed|ingly tender in the treatment of their children; and a circum&s;tance happened which proves that they are not le&s;s delicate in other re&s;pects.&mdash;A boat was ordered on &s;hore to get wood and wa|ter: at this time &s;ome of the Indians were on board, and others in their canoes a-long&s;ide the &s;hip: the latter eyed the boat attentively; and, on her putting off, called aloud to their companions, who, without &s;peaking, in&s;tantly handed down the children, and jumped into the canoes, which were hurried after the boat, while the Indians cried out in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful tone. When the &s;hip's boat was near land, &s;ome women were &s;een among the rocks, to
<PB N="66" REF="75">
whom the Indians called out aloud, and they all ran away; but the boat's crew having re|marked their jealous fears, lay on their oars, to convince them that no injury was intended. The Indians landed, drew their canoes on &s;hore, and ha&s;tily followed the objects of their affec|tion.</P>
<P>On the 5th, at the reque&s;t of the Surgeon, orders were given that no more mu&s;cles, of which they had hitherto collected plenty, &s;hould be brought on board, as the crew began to be troubled with fluxes. On the 10th the two &s;hips &s;ailed in company; and on the 11th they lo&s;t &s;ight of each other, and did not meet again during the whole voyage. This day the Dol|phin cleared the Streight of Magellan, in which &s;he had laboured with innumerable difficulties, and e&s;caped mo&s;t imminent dangers, in a pa&s;|&s;age of almo&s;t four months, viz. from Decem|ber the 17th, 1766, to the 11th of April, 1767.</P>
<P>Captain Wallis now proceeds to a de&s;cription of the places in which the &s;hips anchored, dur|ing their pa&s;&s;age through the Streight; but as a minute recital of bearings, di&s;tances, and &s;oundings, would be unintelligible to mo&s;t of our readers, and po&s;&s;ibly di&s;gu&s;ting to them all, we &s;hall omit the&s;e particulars; extracting only &s;uch anecdotes as may furni&s;h real improvement or entertainment.</P>
<P>In the year 1581 the Spaniards built a town, which they named Phillipville, and left in it a
<PB N="67" REF="76">
colony of four hundred per&s;ons. The&s;e were all &s;tarved to death except twenty-four, all of whom but one proceeded in &s;earch of the river Plata, and mo&s;t probably peri&s;hed, as no tid|ings were ever heard of them: the remaining man, who&s;e name was Hernando, was taken on board by Sir William Cavendi&s;h, in the year 1587, and brought to England; and the place was called Port Famine, from the melancholy fate of the&s;e unfortunate men. Wood and wa|ter abounds at this place; gee&s;e, ducks, teal, &amp;c. are in great abundance, and there is no want of fi&s;h; &s;o that the face of things mu&s;t be greatly changed &s;ince the Spaniards died there of hunger.</P>
<P>Cape Holland Bay, where fi&s;h are catched in great plenty; and the adjacent country pro|duces plenty of cranberries and wild celery, but there are no birds. At Cape Gallant Bay there is wood, water, vegetables, and fi&s;h; as there is al&s;o at Elizabeth's Bay, and York Road. Butler's Bay abounds with rock-fi&s;h, mu&s;cles, wild-fowls, &amp;c. Lion Cove and Goodluck Bay produce &s;carce any thing but wood and water. Mu&s;cles and rock-fi&s;h are found at Swallow Harbour, the mountains round which are de&s;o|late beyond de&s;cription. Upright Bay produces excellent water, and &s;ome wild-fowl and fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 12th of April they held a we&s;tward cour&s;e, during which a number of &s;heerwaters, pintadoes, gannets, and other birds,
<PB N="68" REF="77">
flew about the &s;hip; the upper works of which being open, and the cloaths and bedding con|&s;tantly wet, the &s;ailors in a few days were at|tacked with colds and fevers. The 27th of this month proving a fine day, the &s;ick were brought on deck, and nouri&s;hed with &s;alop, and porta|ble &s;oup, in which wheat was boiled. The vio|lent gales &s;oon returned, &s;o that the beds were again wet through, and it was feared that the &s;hip would lo&s;e her ma&s;ts: they therefore began to think of altering their cour&s;e, in hope of better weather; and the rather, as the number of &s;ick encrea&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that there was danger of &s;oon wanting hands to navigate the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened from this time till the 14th of May, when &s;omething appeared to the ea&s;tward, which looked like high land, towards which a flock of brown birds were ob|&s;erved to fly: they therefore &s;teered all night for this &s;uppo&s;ed land; but at day-break could &s;ee no &s;igns of it. As the weather now mended, the people recovered very fa&s;t; and the car|penters were bu&s;ied in caulking the upper-works of the &s;hip, and repairing the boats. On the 21&s;t they &s;aw a number of flying-fi&s;h, and on the day following tropic birds, bonettas, and dolphins. About this time tho&s;e who had recovered from colds were attacked with the &s;curvy; on which &s;ome &s;weet-wort was extracted from malt for their u&s;e, and they were &s;upplied with pickled cabbage, and wine in&s;tead of
<PB N="69" REF="78">
brandy. Two grampu&s;es were &s;een on the 26th, and on the day following variety of birds, one of which was taken for a land-bird, and re&s;em|bled a &s;wallow. Every method of cleanline&s;s, and change of food, was now taken to prevent the &s;curvy, which began to encrea&s;e very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of June they &s;aw &s;everal men of war birds, and the next day ob&s;erved &s;ome gan|nets; and the weather being at this time very various, they conceived hopes that they drew near the land. On the 4th a turtle &s;wam clo&s;e by the &s;hip; and the next day a great variety of birds were &s;een.</P>
<P>The long wi&s;hed-for relief was now fa&s;t ap|proaching; for on Saturday the 6th the man at the ma&s;t-head cried, <Q REND="inline">"Land in the we&s;t-north-we&s;t."</Q> This proved to be a low i&s;land, di&s;tant five or &s;ix leagues, and was &s;oon &s;een from the deck, to the great joy of every one on board. When they came within five miles of this i&s;land, they di&s;covered another to the we&s;t-north-we&s;t. Two boats were &s;ent to the fir&s;t di&s;covered i&s;land, under the command of the &s;econd Lieu|tenant, the crews being well provided with arms. When the boats came near the i&s;land, two ca|noes were ob&s;erved to put off to the other i&s;land. The crews having landed, gathered &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and collected a quantity of &s;curvy-gra&s;s, with which they returned to the &s;hip, bringing with them &s;ome fi&s;h-hooks which the i&s;landers had formed of oy&s;ter-&s;hells. In this excur&s;ion
<PB N="70" REF="79">
they &s;aw three huts, &s;upported on po&s;ts, and open all round, but thatched with cocoa-nut and palm leaves, ingeniou&s;ly wrought toge|ther. As no anchorage was to be found, and the whole i&s;land was encompa&s;&s;ed with rocks and breakers, the Captain re&s;olved to &s;teer for the other i&s;land, giving the name of WHITSUN ISLAND to this, becau&s;e it was di&s;covered on the eve of Whit&s;unday.</P>
<P>Having approached the other i&s;land, about 50 of the natives, armed with pikes, and &s;ome having fire-brands in their hands, were ob&s;erv|ed running on the coa&s;t. Two boats were &s;ent out, manned and armed, and the Lieutenant was in&s;tructed to &s;teer for that part of the &s;hore where the people had been &s;een; to avoid of|fending them, and to try to procure water and fruit in exchange for &s;uch commodities as he took with them. When the boat came near the &s;hore, the natives put them&s;elves in a po&s;ition as if they would defend it with their pikes; but the crew making &s;igns of friend&s;hip, and ex|po&s;ing their trinkets, &s;ome of the Indians walk|ed into the water; to whom it was hinted, that &s;ome cocoa-nuts and water would be acceptable; which was no &s;ooner done, than they fetched a &s;mall quantity of each, which they ventured to bring to the boats, and received &s;ome nails and other trifles in exchange. While they were dealing, one of the Indians &s;tole a &s;ilk handker|chief
<PB N="71" REF="80">
with its contents, but the thief could by no means be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The next morning the boats were again di&s;|patched, with orders to land, if they could do it without offence to the natives. As they ap|proached the &s;hore, they ob&s;erved &s;even large canoes, each with two ma&s;ts, laying ready for the Indians to embark in them: the&s;e having made &s;igns to the crew to proceed farther, and this being done, the Indians embarked, and &s;ailed we&s;tward, being joined by two canoes at another part of the i&s;land. The&s;e canoes, two of which were la&s;hed together, appeared to be 30 feet in length, four in breadth, and three in depth. The people had long black hair hang|ing over their &s;houlders, were of a dark com|plexion, and of the middle &s;ize. They were dre&s;&s;ed in a kind of matting made fa&s;t round the middle; and it was remarked, that the wo|men were beautiful, and the men ju&s;tly pro|portioned.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant being again &s;ent on &s;hore, the Captain commanded him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land in the king's name, and to call it QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLAND. The boats re|turned loaded with cocoa-nuts and &s;curvy gra&s;s, after having found two wells of excellent water. Provi&s;ions for a week were now allotted for a mate and twenty men, who were left on &s;hore to fill water; the &s;ick were landed for the benefit of the air; and a number of hands were appoint|ed
<PB N="72" REF="81">
to climb the cocoa-trees, and gather the nuts.</P>
<P>On the 10th the water was brought on board the &s;hip, but the cocoa-nuts, and vegetables which the cutter was bringing off, were lo&s;t by the rolling of the waves, which almo&s;t filled her with water. On this i&s;land were found &s;eve|ral tools, re&s;embling adzes, awls and chi&s;&s;els, which were formed of &s;hells and &s;tones. The dead bodies were not buried, but left to decay above ground, under a kind of canopy.</P>
<P>The &s;hip &s;ailed this day, after taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the i&s;lands for the king; in te&s;timony of which they left a flag flying, and carved his maje&s;ty's name on a piece of wood, and on the bark of &s;everal trees. For the u&s;e of the na|tives they left &s;hillings, &s;ixpences, halfpence, bottles, nails, hatchets, and other things. It &s;hould be remarked that, on this i&s;land, they found the very people who had fled from Queen Charlotte's I&s;land, with &s;everal others, in the whole near one hundred. It lies in 19 degrees 20 minutes &s;outh latitude, and 138 degrees 30 minutes we&s;t longitude; and received the name of EGMONT ISLAND.</P>
<P>On the 11th they ob&s;erved about &s;ixteen per|&s;ons on an i&s;land which was called GLOUCESTER ISLAND; but, as it was &s;urrounded with rocks and breakers, they did not attempt to land. This day they likewi&s;e di&s;covered another, which was called CUMBERLAND ISLAND; and, on the
<PB N="73" REF="82">
day following, a third, which received the name of PRINCE WILLIAM HENRY'S ISLAND.</P>
<P>On the 17th they again di&s;covered land, and at ten at night &s;aw a light, which convinced them that it was inhabited; and remarked, that there was plenty of cocoa-trees, a certain indi|cation that there was no want of water.</P>
<P>The day following an officer was &s;ent to the &s;hore, with in&s;tructions to exchange &s;ome toys for &s;uch things as the i&s;land produced. He &s;aw a great number of the people, but could find no place in which the &s;hip might anchor. Some of the Indians, who had white &s;ticks in their hands, appeared to have an authority over the re&s;t. While the Lieutenant was trafficking with them, an Indian diving into the water &s;eized the grappling of the boat, while his compa|nions on the &s;hore laid hold of the rope by which &s;he was fa&s;tened, and attempted to draw her into the &s;urf: but their endeavours were fru&s;trated by the firing of a mu&s;ket, on which all parties let go their hold. The&s;e Indians were dre&s;&s;ed in a kind of cloth, a piece of which was brought to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>From the number of the people &s;een, and their having &s;ome large double canoes on the &s;hore, it was thought that there were larger i&s;lands at no great di&s;tance: the Captain, there|fore, having named this place OSNABURGH ISLAND, made &s;ail, and having &s;oon di&s;covered
<PB N="74" REF="83">
high land, came to an anchor, becau&s;e the wea|ther was very foggy.</P>
<P>Early the next morning they &s;aw land, di&s;|tant 4 or 5 leagues; but after having &s;ailed to|wards it &s;ome time, thought it prudent again to anchor, on account of the thickne&s;s of the fog: but it no &s;ooner cleared away, than they found the &s;hip encompa&s;&s;ed by hundreds of ca|noes, in which were many hundreds of people. Having approached the &s;hip, they behold it with wonder, and talked with great earne&s;tne&s;s. Some baubles were now &s;hewn them, and &s;igns were made for them to come on board, on which they rowed the canoes towards each other, and a general con&s;ultation took place; at the conclu&s;ion of which they all &s;urrounded the &s;hip with an appearance of friend&s;hip, and one of them delivered an oration, at the conclu&s;ion of which he threw into the &s;ea the branch of a plantain-tree which he had held in his hand. This being done, a young Indian, of more ap|parent courage than the re&s;t, ventured on board the &s;hip. The Captain would have given him &s;ome baubles, but he refu&s;ed the acceptance of them till tho&s;e in the canoes came a-long&s;ide, and, having held a con&s;ultation, threw on board &s;everal branches of the plantain-tree. Others now ventured on board; but it was remarked, that they all got into the &s;hip at &s;ome improper part, not one of them, even by accident, find|ing the right place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">cent.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="84">A goat belonging to the &s;hip having ran his horns again&s;t the back of one of the Indians, he looked round with &s;urprize, and &s;eeing the animal ready to renew the attack, he &s;prang over the &s;hip's &s;ide, and was in&s;tantly followed by all his countrymen. Their terror, however, &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided, and they returned to the &s;hip; and the &s;heep, hogs and poultry being &s;hewn them, they intimated that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the two latter &s;pecies. The Captain now gave them nails and other trifles, and made &s;igns that he wanted hogs, fowls and fruit; but they could not comprehend him. They were detected in &s;everal attempts to take away any thing they could lay hold of; but one of them, at length, jumped overboard with a laced hat &s;natched from one of the officers.</P>
<P>The inner parts of the i&s;land abound in hills cloathed with timber trees, above them are high peaks, from which large rivers de&s;cend to the &s;ea. The hou&s;es, when &s;een at a di&s;tance, re&s;emble a barn, having no &s;helter but a roof: the land towards the &s;ea is level, and produces the cocoa-nut, with variety of other fruits; and the face of the whole country is picture&s;que beyond de&s;cription.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed along the &s;hore, while the canoes, which could not keep pace with them, made towards the land. In the afternoon the &s;hip brought to, and the boats being &s;ent to &s;ound a bay that promi&s;ed good anchorage, the
<PB N="76" REF="85">
Indian canoes flocked round them. The Cap|tain, apprehen&s;ive that their de&s;igns were ho&s;|tile, made a &s;ignal for the boats to return to the &s;hip, and fired a gun over the heads of the In|dians. Though they were frightened at the report, they attempted to prevent the return of the cutter, but &s;he ea&s;ily out-&s;ailed them. This being ob&s;erved by &s;ome canoes in a different &s;ta|tion, they intercepted her, and wounded &s;ome of her people with &s;tones, which occa&s;ioned the firing a mu&s;ket, and &s;ome &s;hot were lodged in the &s;houlder of the man who began the at|tack; which the Indians ob&s;erving, they all made off with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>The boats having reached the &s;hip, prepara|tions were made for &s;ailing; but a large canoe being ob&s;erved to make towards her at a great rate, it was re&s;olved to wait the event of her arrival; on which an Indian, making a &s;peech, threw a plantain-branch on board, and the Cap|tain returned the compliment of peace, by giv|ing them a branch, which had been left on board by the other Indians: &s;ome toys being likewi&s;e given them, they departed with much &s;eeming &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed; and the next morning were off a peak of land which was almo&s;t covered with the natives and their hou&s;es. On the 21&s;t the &s;hip came to an anchor, and &s;everal canoes came a-long&s;ide of her, bringing a large quan|tity of fruit, with fowls and hogs, for which
<PB N="77" REF="86">
they received nails and toys in exchange. The boats having been &s;ent to &s;ound along the coa&s;t, were followed by large double canoes, three of which ran at the cutter, &s;taved in her quarter, and otherwi&s;e damaged her; the Indians, at the &s;ame time, armed with clubs, endeavouring to board her. The crew now fired, and wound|ing one man dangerou&s;ly, and killing another, they both fell into the &s;ea, whither their com|panions dived after them, and got them into the canoe. They now tried if they could &s;tand or &s;it; but as the one was quite dead, they laid him at the bottom of the canoe; and the wound|ed man was &s;upported in a &s;itting po&s;ture. The &s;hips boats now kept on their way, while &s;ome of the canoes went a&s;hore, and others returned to the &s;hip to renew their merchandize.</P>
<P>While the boats continued out in &s;earch of &s;oundings, the natives &s;wam off to them with water and fruit. The women were particularly urgent for the &s;ailors to land, and, pulling off all their cloaths, gave hints, of the mo&s;t inde|licate nature, how acceptable their company would be.</P>
<P>The boats being &s;ent on &s;hore with &s;ome &s;mall ca&s;ks to get water, the Indians filled two of them, and kept all the re&s;t for their trouble. When the boats came off, the &s;hore was crouded with thou&s;ands of men, women, and children. During this time &s;everal canoes remained a-long&s;ide the &s;hip; but the Captain would not
<PB N="78" REF="87">
permit a &s;ingle Indian to go on board, as there was no guarding again&s;t their artful di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>On the 22d the natives brought hogs, poul|try, and fruit to the &s;hip, which they bartered for knives and other things; &s;o that the whole crew was &s;upplied with meat for two days, by means of this traffick. The boats having been this day &s;ent for water, every inducement was u&s;ed by the inhabitants to per&s;uade them to land: and the behaviour of the women was &s;till more la&s;civious than before. Having procured a &s;mall quantity of water, the boats put off; on which the women &s;houted aloud, pelted them with apples and bananas, and &s;hewed every mark of contempt and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>The &s;hip made &s;ail the day following, with intention to anchor off the watering-place; but the man at the ma&s;t-head di&s;covering a bay a few miles to the leeward, they immediately &s;tood for it. The boats, which were a-head, making a &s;ignal for anchorage, they prepared to bring to; but when the &s;hip had almo&s;t reached the boats, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;truck, and her head re|mained immoveably fixed on a coral rock; in which &s;ituation &s;he remained near an hour, when &s;he was happily relieved by a breeze from the &s;hore. During the whole time that &s;he was in danger of being wrecked, &s;he was encompa&s;&s;ed by hundreds of Indians in their canoes; but not one of them attempted to board her. The
<PB N="79" REF="88">
&s;hip was now piloted round a reef, into an har|bour, where &s;he moored.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter was then &s;ent to found the bay, and found &s;afe anchorage in every part of it. In the mean time &s;ome &s;mall canoes brought provi&s;ions on board; but as the &s;hore was croud|ed with large canoes, filled with men, the Cap|tain loaded and primed his guns, &s;upplied his boats with mu&s;quetoons, and kept a number of the men con&s;tantly under arms.</P>
<P>On the 24th the &s;hip &s;ailed up the harbour, and was followed by many canoes, bringing provi&s;ions, which were exchanged for nails, knives, &amp;c. In the evening a number of very large canoes advanced, laden with &s;tones; on which the Captain ordered the &s;tricte&s;t watch to be kept. At length &s;ome canoes came off, with a number of women on board, who, being brought almo&s;t under the &s;hip, began to prac|ti&s;e tho&s;e arts of indelicacy already mentioned. During this &s;ingular exhibition the large canoes came clo&s;e round the &s;hip; &s;ome of the Indians playing on a kind of flute, others &s;inging, and the re&s;t blowing a &s;ort of &s;hells. Soon after a large canoe advanced, in which was an awning, on the top of which &s;at one of the natives, holding &s;ome yellow and red feathers in his hand. The Captain having con&s;ented to his coming a-long&s;ide, he delivered the feathers; and while a pre&s;ent was preparing for him, he put back from the &s;hip, and threw the branch
<PB N="80" REF="89">
of a cocoa-tree in the air. This was, doubtle&s;s, the &s;ignal for an on&s;et; for there was an in&s;tant &s;hout from all the canoes, which, approaching the &s;hip, threw vollies of &s;tones into every part of her. On this two guns, loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, were fired, and the people on guard di&s;|charged their mu&s;kets. The number of Indians now round the &s;hip were full two thou&s;and; and though they were at fir&s;t di&s;concerted, they &s;oon recovered their &s;pirits, and renewed the attack. Thou&s;ands of the Indians were now ob&s;erved on &s;hore, embarking as fa&s;t as the canoes could bring them off: orders were therefore given for firing the cannon, &s;ome of which were brought to bear upon the &s;hore. This firing put a &s;top to all ho&s;tilities, on the part of the Indians, for a &s;mall time: but the &s;cattered canoes &s;oon got together again, and, having hoi&s;ted white &s;tream|ers, advanced, and threw &s;tones of two pounds weight from &s;lings; by which a number of the &s;eamen were wounded. At this time &s;everal canoes approached the bow of the &s;hip, from whence no &s;hot had been yet di&s;charged. In one of the&s;e was an Indian, who appeared to have an authority over the re&s;t: a gun was therefore levelled at his canoe, the &s;hot of which &s;plit it in two pieces. This put an end to the conte&s;t; the canoes rowed off with the utmo&s;t &s;peed, and the people on &s;hore ran and concealed them|&s;elves behind the hills.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="90">The Captain now failed for his intended an|choring-place, and moored the &s;hip within a &s;mall di&s;tance of a fine river. The next morn|ing &s;ome per&s;ons, who had been &s;ent to &s;urvey the &s;hore, returned with an account that the ri|ver produced fre&s;h water, and that there was not a &s;ingle canoe to be &s;een.</P>
<P>This day a Lieutenant was di&s;patched, with all the boats manned and armed, and a number of marines, with orders to land under cover of the &s;hip and boats; which being effected, he turned a piece of turf, and having hoi&s;ted a pendant on a &s;taff, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, for his Sovereign, by the name of KING GEORGE THE THIRD'S ISLAND. He then mixed &s;ome rum with the river water, and every per|&s;on pre&s;ent drank the King's health. At this time the Lieutenant ob&s;erved two old men on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, who &s;eemed much terrified, and a&s;&s;umed a po&s;ture of &s;upplication. Signs were made for them to cro&s;s the river, which one of them having done, he crawled on his hands and knees towards the Lieutenant; who, &s;hewing him &s;ome &s;tones that had been thrown at the &s;hip, hinted that the Indians &s;hould receive no harm if they were not the ag|gre&s;&s;ors. Some hatchets were now produced, to intimate that they wi&s;hed to barter for pro|vi&s;ions; and &s;ome trifling matters were given to the Indian, who te&s;tified his joy and gratitude by dancing round the pendant. He then plucked
<PB N="82" REF="91">
&s;ome branches of trees, which he laid on the ground, and retreated; but &s;oon returning with &s;everal others, they advanced towards the pen|dant, which happening to be &s;haken by the wind, they ran back with evident &s;igns of a&s;|toni&s;hment. They &s;oon recovered from their &s;urprize, and procuring two hogs, laid them down at the foot of the flag-&s;taff, and danced round it; after which they put the hogs into a canoe, and the old Indian rowed it to the &s;hip: when he came a-long&s;ide he delivered a &s;erious oration, in the cour&s;e of which he handed up a number of plantain-leaves, one at a time: this being done, he rowed back, after refu&s;ing &s;e|veral pre&s;ents that had been offered him.</P>
<P>In the night a number of lights were &s;een on the coa&s;t, and the noi&s;e of drums and other in|&s;truments of mu&s;ic was heard. Soon after day|light it was ob&s;erved that the Indians had left the coa&s;t, and taken away the pendant. This day, while a party was engaged in filling the water ca&s;ks, the old man, who had been &s;een the day before, cro&s;&s;ed the river, and brought with him &s;ome fowls and fruit. The Captain, who was indi&s;po&s;ed on board the &s;hip, employed him&s;elf in remarking what was going forward on &s;hore; and, by the help of gla&s;&s;es, he &s;aw many of the Indians creeping behind the bu&s;hes towards the watering-place, while incredible numbers were coming through the woods, and a large party de&s;cending a hill, all advancing to the &s;ame
<PB N="83" REF="92">
&s;pot; and two divi&s;ions of canoes were mak|ing round the oppo&s;ite points of the bay. The Lieutenant, &s;eeing his danger, got his party on board the boats; but not before he had &s;ent the old Indian to prevail on the others to keep at a proper di&s;tance, as he wanted only water:&mdash;but this had no effect; and, as &s;oon as the crews were in the boats, the natives po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the ca&s;ks as lawful prize. Tho&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance from the watering-place pu&s;hed forward with all &s;peed, keeping pace with the canoes, which were rowed at an extraordinary rate; while a great number of women and chil|dren were &s;eated on a hill, from whence they could command a view of all that pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the canoes came near that part of the bay where the &s;hip rode, they took in many people from the &s;hore, who were laden with bags filled with &s;tones. All the canoes now ap|proached the &s;hip; on which the Captain gave orders to fire on the fir&s;t clu&s;ter of them that &s;hould a&s;&s;emble; this had &s;uch an effect, that they all rowed off with the utmo&s;t &s;peed. They then fired into &s;everal parts of the wood, on which the Indians all fled to the hill where the women and children were; &s;o that &s;everal thou|&s;ands were now on that &s;pot. The Captain be|ing re&s;olved to make this action deci&s;ive, fired towards the hill; and two balls falling near a &s;pot where many of the&s;e poor Indians had &s;ta|tioned
<PB N="84" REF="93">
them&s;elves, they were all terrified beyond de&s;cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ption, and di&s;appeared in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>When this di&s;agreeable &s;kirmi&s;h was end|ed, the boats were hoi&s;ted out, and a &s;trong guard &s;ent with the carpenters, who had orders to de&s;troy every canoe they could find; and this &s;ervice was performed with &s;uch alacrity, that in a few hours a great number of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were cut in pieces, &s;everal of which were of the large&s;t &s;ize. Some fruit, fowls, and hogs, were found in a few of the &s;malle&s;t; but the re&s;t were laden with &s;tones and &s;lings.</P>
<P>It was not long before a &s;mall party of In|dians advanced to the &s;ea-&s;hore, and &s;ticking up &s;ome &s;mall branches of trees, went back to the woods: but they came again repeatedly, bring|ing with them a quantity of the cloth they wear, and &s;ome dogs and hogs with their legs tied; all which they laid on the &s;hore, making &s;igns to the &s;ailors to take them. A boat being &s;ent on &s;hore, the hogs were conveyed on board, but the other articles left. In return for the&s;e pre|&s;ents, &s;everal hatchets and nails were left on the beach, and &s;igns made to &s;ome of the Indians within &s;ight to come and take them; which they neglected to do for &s;ome time, till the Cap|tain having &s;ent for the cloth, the natives then accepted his pre&s;ents with apparent &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>On the 27th, while a party was getting water, the old man before-mentioned appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river; and having ha|rangued
<PB N="85" REF="94">
them &s;ome time, he came over; when the officer, pointing to the bags and &s;tones which had been brought down, tried to convince him that his countrymen had injured the Engli&s;h, who had acted only on the defen&s;ive. His meaning &s;eemed to be well under&s;tood, but the old Indian could not admit the force of his ar|guments:&mdash;on the contrary, he expre&s;&s;ed very forcibly, by his countenance, voice, and ac|tions, the high &s;en&s;e he had of the injury of|fered his unhappy friends. At length a recon|ciliation took place; the old man &s;hook hands with, and accepted &s;ome pre&s;ents from the Lieutenant, who tried to convince him of his good-will; hinted that the natives &s;hould not appear but in &s;mall parties, and that while the boats crews were on one &s;ide of the river they &s;hould remain on the other. The old man de|parted with evident &s;igns of being content with the&s;e terms; and in a few hours the natives be|gan a traffic, which proved highly advantageous to the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>The &s;ick were now &s;ent on &s;hore, and lodged in a tent near the watering-place, under the care of the Surgeon. This gentleman having &s;not a wild-duck, it dropped near &s;ome Indians on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, who were &s;o terrified that they in&s;tantly fled, but &s;topping within a &s;hort &s;pace, he prevailed on one of them to bring over the duck, which he at length com|plied with, and laid it at the Surgeon's feet,
<PB N="86" REF="95">
while his looks expre&s;&s;ed the fear and agitation of his mind. At a &s;econd &s;hot three ducks were killed; which gave the natives &s;uch an idea of the effects of a gun, that to this circum&s;tance is chiefly attributed the regularity of their be|haviour in all their tran&s;actions, while the En|gli&s;h remained among them.</P>
<P>Orders were now i&s;&s;ued, that the gunner &s;hould tran&s;act all matters of trade between the Indians and the &s;ailors, with a view to prevent pilfering and quarrelling: the natives, indeed, would &s;ometimes &s;teal a trifle, but the very &s;ight of a gun procured in&s;tant re&s;titution of it. The old Indian, having been attached to the Engli&s;h, was very u&s;eful in the recovery of the &s;tolen goods. One day an Indian &s;wam over the river, and took a hatchet, on which the gunner made pre|parations as if he would go in &s;earch of the thief; but this being intimated to the old man, he immediately went after the lo&s;t goods, which he brought back. The gunner now demanded that the culprit &s;hould al&s;o be produced, and the old Indian complied, though much again&s;t his inclination. The pri&s;oner, who had com|mitted other robberies, was &s;ent on board the &s;hip whence the Captain di&s;charged him, with|out farther puni&s;hment than the terror ari&s;ing from his &s;ituation. His countrymen were tran&s;|ported with joy to &s;ee him come back; and he was conducted into the woods, amid&s;t the ap|plau&s;ive &s;houts of his friends. This man had
<PB N="87" REF="96">
the gratitude to bring a roa&s;ted hog and &s;ome bread fruit to the gunner next day, as an ac|knowledgment for the lenity &s;hewn him.</P>
<P>The Captain, Fir&s;t Lieutenant, and Pur&s;er, were at this time very ill; &s;o that the care of the ve&s;&s;el, and the &s;uperintendance of the &s;ick, were committed to the Second Lieutenant, who di&s;charged his duty with &s;uch zeal and fidelity, that all was order and decorum. Fruit, fowls, and fre&s;h pork, were procured in &s;uch plenty, that at the end of fourteen days almo&s;t every man had perfectly recovered his health.</P>
<P>On the 29th a piece of &s;altpetre, of the &s;ize of a &s;mall egg, was found on &s;hore; but whether it had been brought from the &s;hip, or not, could not be learnt, after the mo&s;t diligent enquiry; but no other piece was found on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 2d of July they began to want fruit and fre&s;h meat, owing to the ab&s;ence of the old Indian; but they had &s;till a &s;ufficient &s;upply for the &s;ick. On the 3d the &s;hip's bottom was ex|amined, when its condition was nearly the &s;ame as when &s;he left England. This day a &s;hark was caught, which proved an acceptable pre|&s;ent to the Indians.</P>
<P>The old Indian, who had vi&s;ited the interior parts of the i&s;land, in que&s;t of provi&s;ions, re|turned on the 5th, and brought with him a roa&s;ted hog as a pre&s;ent for the Captain, who, in return, enriched him by putting him in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a looking-gla&s;s, an iron pot, &amp;c. His
<PB N="88" REF="97">
return was &s;oon followed by &s;ome of the na|tives who had never yet vi&s;ited the market; the&s;e brought &s;ome hogs that were larger than any yet purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>A traffick of a &s;ingular kind was now e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between the Indian girls and the &s;ailors. The price of a lady's favour was a nail or two; but as the tars could not always get at the nails, they drew them out from &s;everal parts of the &s;hip; nor could a &s;ingle offender be di&s;covered by the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry. The damage done to the &s;hip could be ea&s;ily repaired; but one ill con&s;equence aro&s;e from this traffick, which could not have been fore&s;een: for on the gunner's of|fering &s;mall nails for hogs, the Indians produced large &s;pikes, demanding &s;uch as tho&s;e. Some of the men made u&s;e of a &s;ingular device to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions; for, when they could procure no more nails, they cut lead into the &s;hape of nails, and pa&s;&s;ed it as &s;terling on their un&s;u&s;pecting fair ones. When the Indians di&s;|covered the fraud, they demanded nails for the lead; but this ju&s;t demand could not be granted, becau&s;e it would have promoted the &s;tealing of lead, and thereby injured the traffic with iron.</P>
<P>The &s;ailors, in con&s;equence of their connec|tion with the women, became &s;o impatient of controul, that the Captain ordered the arti+cles of war to be read, to awe them into obe|dience; and a Corporal of marines was &s;everely
<PB N="89" REF="98">
puni&s;hed, for &s;triking the ma&s;ter at arms. The Captain's health being now nearly re&s;tored, he went in his boat to &s;urvey the i&s;land, which he found extremely delightful, and every where well peopled.</P>
<P>On the 8th the wood-cutters were entertained in a friendly manner by &s;ome Indians, who &s;eemed to be of a rank above tho&s;e they had yet &s;een: and &s;ome of the&s;e vi&s;iting the Cap|tain, he laid before them a thirty-&s;ix &s;hilling piece, a guinea, a crown-piece, a dollar, &s;ome &s;hillings, new halfpence, and two large nails; and having intimated that they might take their choice, they eagerly &s;eized the nails, and then took a few halfpence; but left all the other pieces untouched.</P>
<P>The Indians now refu&s;ed to &s;upply the mar|ket, unle&s;s they could get large nails in ex|change: the Captain therefore ordered the &s;hip to be &s;earched, when it was found that almo&s;t all the hammock-nails were &s;tolen, and great numbers drawn from different places: on which every man was ordered before the Captain, who told them, that not a man &s;hould go on &s;hore till the thieves were di&s;covered; but no good con&s;equence aro&s;e from his threats.</P>
<P>Three days after this, the gunner conducted to the &s;hip a lady of a portly figure and agree|able face, who&s;e age &s;eemed to be upwards of forty. This lady had but lately arrived in that part of the i&s;land; and the gunner, ob&s;erving
<PB N="90" REF="99">
that &s;he &s;eemed to have great authority, pre|&s;ented her with &s;ome toys; on which &s;he invited him to her hou&s;e, and gave him &s;ome fine hogs. She was afterwards taken on board at her own de&s;ire, where her whole behaviour indicated the woman of fine &s;en&s;e and &s;uperior rank. The Captain pre&s;ented her with a looking-gla&s;s and &s;ome toys, and gave her a hand&s;ome blue man|tle, which he tied round her with ribbands.</P>
<P>Having intimated that &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the Captain on &s;hore, he &s;ignified his inten|tion of vi&s;iting her on the following day. Ac|cordingly on Sunday the 12th, Captain Wallis went on &s;hore, where he was met by his fair friend, who was attended by a numerous reti|nue, &s;ome of whom &s;he directed to carry the Captain, and others who had been ill, over the river, and thence to her habitation: the pro|ce&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed by a guard of marines and &s;eamen. As they advanced, great numbers of Indians crowded to &s;ee them; but, on a &s;light motion of her hand, they made ample room for the proce&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Having come near her habitation, many per|&s;ons of both &s;exes advanced to meet her, whom &s;he cau&s;ed to ki&s;s the Captain's hand, while &s;he &s;ignified that they were related to her. Her hou&s;e was above 320 feet in length, and about 40 in breadth. The roof, which was covered with the leaves of the palm-tree, was &s;upported by a row of pillars on each &s;ide, and another in the middle. The highe&s;t part of the thatch
<PB N="91" REF="100">
on the in&s;ide was about 30 feet from the ground, and the &s;pace between the &s;ides of the building and the edge of the roof being 12 feet, was left entirely open.</P>
<P>The Captain, Lieutenant, and Pur&s;er, be|ing &s;eated, the lady helped four of her fe|male attendants to pull off their coats, &s;hoes, and &s;tockings; which being aukwardly per|formed, the girls &s;moothed down the &s;kin, and rubbed it lightly with their hands for more than half an hour; and the gentlemen received great benefit from the operation. The Surgeon, being heated with walking, having pulled off his wig, one of the Indians &s;creamed out; the eyes of the whole company were in|&s;tantly fixed on the miraculous &s;ight, and they remained &s;ome time in the mo&s;t profound a&s;to|ni&s;hment. When they had recovered from their &s;urprize, the lady ordered &s;everal bales of cloth, the produce of the i&s;land, to be brought out, in which &s;he dre&s;&s;ed the Captain and all his at|tendants. Orders had been given, that the Cap|tain &s;hould be carried as before; but as he cho&s;e to walk, &s;he took hold of his arm, and when they came near any wet or dirty places, &s;he lift|ed him over, with as much ea&s;e as a man would a child. She attended them to the &s;hore, when &s;he took her leave; having pre&s;ented the Cap|tain with a fine &s;ow, big with young.</P>
<P>On the following day the gunner being di&s;|patched to this lady, with a compliment of bill|hooks,
<PB N="92" REF="101">
hatchets, &amp;c. found her entertaining many hundreds of the natives, who were &s;eated in order round her habitation. A me&s;s was or|dered for the gunner, who reported, that it was of an agreeable flavour, and &s;eemed to be a compound of fowls and apples, &s;hred in &s;mall pieces, and mixed with &s;alt-water. The lady her&s;elf di&s;tributed the provi&s;ions, which were &s;erved in cocoa-nut &s;hells, and tho&s;e &s;hells brought in trays by her &s;ervants. When the company were all fed, the lady took her &s;eat &s;omewhat above the re&s;t, and was fed by two female &s;ervants, one &s;tanding on each &s;ide of her. She received the Captain's pre&s;ents with evident &s;igns of &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>From this period the crew was much better &s;upplied with refre&s;hments, hogs and fowls be|ing brought to the market daily; but they could not be purcha&s;ed at the former prices, owing to the commerce before-mentioned, between the &s;ailors and the Indian women: the Captain therefore ordered, that not one woman &s;hould be permitted to come over the river, and that no man &s;hould leave the &s;hip till he had fir&s;t been &s;earched.</P>
<P>The gunner, who was on &s;hore on the 14th, met with the following affecting incident. He &s;aw an old woman, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, weeping in a mo&s;t lamentable manner. When &s;he found he regarded her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;ent a youth to him, who, having made a long
<PB N="93" REF="102">
oration, laid a branch of plantain at his feet, and then retired, and brought over the woman and two hogs. The youth now made a &s;till longer &s;peech, after the conclu&s;ion of which this un|fortunate woman made the gunner under&s;tand, that when the Engli&s;h fired on her countrymen, her hu&s;band and three of her &s;ons had been kil|led. Her agitation of mind was &s;uch, that be|fore &s;he had fini&s;hed her tale, &s;he &s;unk &s;peechle&s;s to the ground; nor were two lads, who attended her, in a much better &s;ituation. The gunner pitied her di&s;tre&s;s, and endeavoured to comfort her. At length &s;he became &s;omewhat calmer, offered him her hand, and directed the hogs to be given him: in return he would have given her much more than their value, but &s;he would not take the mo&s;t trifling article.</P>
<P>On the 15th a large party, in all the boats, rowed round part of the i&s;land, in order to take a view of it, and purcha&s;e provi&s;ions. They return|ed with a number of hogs and fowls, and &s;ome plantains and cocoa-nuts. The i&s;land was found to be every where very plea&s;ant, and to abound with various nece&s;&s;aries of life. Great numbers of canoes were &s;een, and &s;everal not quite built. The tools of the natives were formed of bones, &s;hells, and &s;tones. Dogs and hogs were the only four-footed bea&s;ts. The inhabitants ate all their meat either roa&s;ted or baked, having no ve&s;&s;el in which water could be boiled; nor, in|deed, did they &s;eem to have the lea&s;t idea that
<PB N="94" REF="103">
water could be heated by fire; this will be proved by the following circum&s;tance. While the lady &s;o frequently mentioned was at break|fa&s;t on board the &s;hip, a per&s;on that attended her, having ob&s;erved the cock of an urn turned to fill the tea-pot, he al&s;o turned the cock, and the &s;calding water falling on his hand, he cried out, and danced about the cabin, while the other Indians gazed at him with terror and &s;ur|prize.</P>
<P>On the 17th Captain Wallis received another vi&s;it from the lady; (whom he calls his Queen) and this day plenty of refre&s;hments were pur|cha&s;ed of &s;ome Indians, whom they had never dealt with before. The Queen repeated her vi&s;it on the following day, and gave the Captain two hogs: and the Ma&s;ter being &s;ent to attend her home, &s;he clothed him in the dre&s;s of the coun|try, as &s;he had done the Captain and his retinue. On the 19th a great number of hogs and pigs, with fowls and fruits in the greate&s;t abundance, were purcha&s;ed and &s;ent on board by the gun|ner. The next day one of the &s;ailors was &s;en|tenced to run the gauntlet three times round the deck, while the crew whipped him with nettles, for drawing nails from the &s;hip; but the tars were &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;pare a brother in ini|quity, that his puni&s;hment was rather nominal than real: this gave ri&s;e to an order, that no per&s;on &s;hould go on &s;hore but tho&s;e appointed to procure wood and water.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="104">Captain Wallis's Queen paid him another vi|&s;it on the 21&s;t, and pre&s;ented him with &s;ome hogs. On her departure &s;he invited the Captain to her hou&s;e, who, taking &s;ome officers with him, attended her home. On their arrival, &s;he tied round their hats &s;ome wreaths of plaited hair, and di&s;tingui&s;hed the Captain's by the ad|ditional ornament of a tuft of feathers of dif|ferent colours. When they returned &s;he went with them to the water-&s;ide, and ordered &s;ome pre&s;ents into the boat. Ju&s;t before they put off Mr. Wallis intimated, that he &s;hould finally de|part in &s;even days; when &s;he made &s;igns that he &s;hould &s;tay twenty: but his re&s;olution to depart within the fir&s;t-mentioned time being repeated, &s;he wept ince&s;&s;antly for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>By the 22d the &s;hip was &s;o well &s;tored with hogs and fowls that the deck was covered; but, as they would eat little el&s;e than fruit, they were killed fa&s;ter than was otherwi&s;e intended. A boar and &s;ow of this breed were brought to England, and given to Mr. Stephens, &s;ecretary of the admiralty; the former of which was living when this account was printed, but the latter died in farrowing.</P>
<P>On the 24th the Captain pre&s;ented his friend, the old Indian, with cloth and other matters; and &s;ent a variety of things to the Queen, a|mong which were a cat with kitten, turkies, gee&s;e, hens, and various kinds of garden &s;eeds; which compliment &s;he returned by a pre&s;ent of
<PB N="96" REF="105">
fruit and hogs. While they remained here they &s;owed peas and garden &s;eeds, and &s;taid long enough to &s;ee them come up, and likely to thrive.</P>
<P>The Captain having &s;ent a party on &s;hore on the 25th to examine the country minutely, cau&s;ed a tent to be erected to ob&s;erve an eclip&s;e of the &s;un, and when it was ended, he took his tele|&s;cope to the Queen's hou&s;e to &s;hew her the u&s;e of it; and her &s;urprize is not to be expre&s;&s;ed, on her beholding &s;everal objects which &s;he was ve|ry familiar with, but which were too di&s;tant to be &s;een by the naked eye. On the conclu&s;ion of this mental fea&s;t, the Captain invited the Queen and her attendants on board the &s;hip, judging that no in&s;ult would be offered to the party he had &s;ent out, while the principle peo|ple were in his power. The Queen's attendants ate heartily of an elegant dinner, and drank water only; but the Queen would neither eat nor drink. When the party returned from their excur&s;ion, the Captain gave orders for landing the Queen and her train. She made &s;igns to be informed, if he held his re&s;olution as to the time of his departure; and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, her tears witne&s;&s;ed the agitation of her mind.</P>
<P>The following is an account of the tran&s;ac|tions and ob&s;ervations of the party which was &s;ent out this day.&mdash;When they fir&s;t landed they called on the old Indian, and taking him with
<PB N="97" REF="106">
them, they walked &s;ome on each &s;ide of the river about two miles, ob&s;erving that the &s;oil was blacki&s;h and rich, and that on the borders of the valley, through which the river flowed, were many hou&s;es with gardens walled in, and plenty of fruit, hogs, and fowls. They now all walked on one &s;ide, as the ground ro&s;e nearly perpendicular on the other. Channels were cut in many places, to conduct the water from the hills to the gardens and plantations, and the ground being fenced off had a plea&s;ing effect to the eye. There was good gra&s;s, but no under|wood beneath the trees: the cocoa-nut and plantain grew on level ground; while the bread|fruit and apple trees were &s;et in rows on the &s;ides of the hills.</P>
<P>The &s;tream now became a perfect meander, and the crags of mountains which ro&s;e on its borders hung over the heads of our travellers. After walking four miles, they &s;at down to breakfa&s;t under an apple-tree, when they were alarmed by the &s;houts of a great number of the natives. They would have had recour&s;e to their arms, but the old Indian making &s;igns for them to &s;it &s;till, went to his countrymen, who be|came at once &s;ilent, and in&s;tantly retired: but they &s;oon returned with variety of refre&s;hments, which the old Indian divided among our tra|vellers; and for which the Lieutenant gave the natives &s;ome buttons, and other trifles.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="107">They then proceeded, and looked diligently for metals and ores, in every place likely to produce them; but found nothing of any con|&s;equence. The old Indian growing weary, hint|ed, that he &s;hould return, having fir&s;t directed his countrymen to clear a pa&s;&s;age for the travel|lers over a mountain. When the old man was gone, the Indians cut branches from the trees, and laid them in a ceremonious manner at the feet of the &s;eamen: they then painted them&s;elves red with the berries of a tree, and &s;tained their garments yellow with the bark of another. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Indians, the mo&s;t difficult parts of the mountain were climbed; and they again refre&s;hed them&s;elves on its &s;ummit, when they &s;aw other mountains &s;o much above them, that they &s;eemed as in a valley.</P>
<P>Towards the &s;ea the pro&s;pect was inexpre&s;&s;i|bly beautiful, the &s;ides of the hills being co|vered with trees, and the vallies with gra&s;s; while the whole country was inter&s;per&s;ed with villages. They &s;aw but few hou&s;es on the mountains above them, but as &s;moke was ob|&s;erved in many places, it was conjectured, that the highe&s;t parts were inhabited. Many &s;prings gu&s;hed from the &s;ides of the mountains, all of which were covered with wood on the &s;ides, and with fern on the &s;ummits. The &s;oil even on the high lands was rich, and the &s;ugar-cane grew without cultivation; as did likewi&s;e ginger and turmerick.</P>

<P><PB N="99" REF="109">Having a third time refre&s;hed them&s;elves, they de&s;cended towards the &s;hip, occa&s;ionally deviating from the direct way, tempted, by the plea&s;ant &s;ituation of &s;everal hou&s;es, the inhabi|tants of which entertained them in the mo&s;t ho&s;|pitable manner. They &s;aw parrots, parro|quets, green doves, and ducks. The Lieute|nant planted the &s;tones of cherries, peaches and plums, &s;everal kinds of garden-&s;eeds, and oranges, lemons and limes. In the afternoon they re&s;ted on a delightful &s;pot, where the inha|bitants dre&s;&s;ed them two hogs and &s;everal fowls. Here they &s;taid till the evening, when they re|warded the diligence of their guides, and re|paired to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 26th the Queen vi&s;ited the Captain, with her u&s;ual pre&s;ents; and on this day they di&s;continued taking in wood and water, and pre|pared for &s;ailing. A greater number of Indians now came to the &s;ea-&s;hore than they had ever yet &s;een; and of the&s;e, &s;everal appeared to be per|&s;ons of con&s;equence. In the afternoon the Queen vi&s;ited captain Wallis, and &s;ollicited him to remain ten days longer; but being informed that he &s;hould certainly &s;ail on the following day, &s;he bur&s;t into tears. She now demanded when he would come again, and was told in 50 days. She remained on board till evening, when being informed that the boat waited for her, &s;he wept with more violence than &s;he had yet done. At length this affectionate creature
<PB N="100" REF="110">
went over the &s;hip's &s;ide, as did the old Indian who had been &s;o &s;erviceable to the crew. This man had &s;ignified, that his &s;on &s;hould &s;ail with the Captain; but when the time of departure came, the youth was not to be found; and it was thought, that parental affection had got the better of the old man's promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Early the next morning two boats were &s;ent to fill a few ca&s;ks of water; but the officer, alarmed at finding the &s;hore crouded with peo|ple, was about to return. This brought the Queen forward, who commanded the Indians to retire to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, and then made &s;igns for the boats to land. While the water was filling, &s;he ordered &s;ome pre&s;ents into the boat, and entreated to go once more to the &s;hip; but the officer having it in charge not to bring off a &s;ingle native, &s;he ordered her double canoe out, and was followed by many others. When &s;he had been on board, weep|ing bitterly, for an hour, advantage was taken of a breeze, and the &s;hip got under &s;ail. She now tenderly embraced the Captain and Offi|cers, and left the &s;hip; but the wind falling, the canoes all put back, and once more reached the &s;hip, to which the Queen's being made fa&s;t, &s;he advanced to the bow of the canoe, and wept ince&s;&s;antly. The Captain pre&s;ented her with &s;everal articles of u&s;e and ornament, which &s;he received in &s;ilent &s;orrow. After &s;ome time a breeze &s;pringing up, the Queen and her attend|ants
<PB N="101" REF="111" MS="y">
took their final leave, with many tears, which drew corre&s;ponding tears from the eyes of our countrymen.</P>
<P>The place where the &s;hip had lain was called PORT ROYAL HARBOUR, and is &s;ituated in 17 degrees 30 minutes &s;outh-longitude, and 150 degrees we&s;t-latitude.</P>
<P>Captain Wallis now proceeds to give a more accurate account of the inhabitants of Ota|heite, with their cu&s;toms, manners, &amp;c.&mdash;The men are from five feet &s;even to ten inches high, well proportioned, alert, and of good counte|nances. The women from five feet to five and a half, hand&s;ome in general, but &s;ome of them as beautiful as can be imagined. The complexion of tho&s;e men who are much on the water is rather red; but the natural colour of them all is the tawny. They are remarkably di&s;|tingui&s;hed from all the other natives of A&s;ia, Africa, and America, by the colours of their hair; for that of the former is univer&s;ally black, while the people of Otaheite have the various colours of black, brown, red and flaxen; mo&s;t of the children having the latter: when left loo&s;e, it has a &s;trong natural curl, but it is u&s;ually worn tied in two bunches, one on each &s;ide the head, or in a &s;ingle bunch in the mid|dle. They anoint the head with the oil of the cocoa-nut, mixed with a root of a fragrant &s;mell.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="112">It has been mentioned, that the ladies do not con&s;ider cha&s;tity as a virtue; but the price of their favours is always proportioned to their charms. When a man offered a girl to the ca|re&s;&s;es of a &s;ailor, he &s;hewed a &s;tick of the &s;ize of the nail that was to purcha&s;e her company.</P>
<P>Their cloaths are formed of two pieces of cloth, not unlike coar&s;e China paper, in one of which a hole is made for the head to pa&s;s thro', and this hangs to the middle of the leg; the other piece is wrapped round the body, and the whole forms an elegant drapery. This cloth is compo&s;ed of the inner bark of a tree. They adorn them|&s;elves with pearls, &s;hells, feathers and flowers. They mark the hinder part of the thighs and loins of both &s;exes with black lines in different forms; which is done by &s;triking the teeth of an in&s;trument through the &s;kin, and rubbing &s;oot mixed with oil into the holes: &s;ome few men, who appeared to be per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion, had their legs marked; but neither boys nor girls are marked till after they are twelve years old.</P>
<P>An Indian who attended the Queen appear|ing to be fond of imitating the Engli&s;h, was pre&s;ented with a &s;uit of the Lieutenant's cloaths, which became him extremely well. As it was &s;hoal-water at the landing-place, the Engli&s;h officers were carried on &s;hore; and this man, unwilling to be out of the fa&s;hion, was carried in the &s;ame manner by the Indians. In his at|tempt
<PB N="103" REF="113">
to u&s;e a knife and fork at fir&s;t, his hand al|ways went to his mouth, while the food remain|ed &s;tuck on the end of the fork.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the articles already mentioned, the&s;e people eat the fle&s;h of dogs. Rats abound on the i&s;land, but are not eaten. The river pro|duces parrot-fi&s;h, groopers, cray-fi&s;h and mul|let, and conchs and mu&s;cles are found on the rocks: the inhabitants u&s;e nets, and hooks and lines.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;ingular in their way of dre&s;&s;ing their food: having produced a fire by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, they dig a pit, which being paved with &s;tones, they make a fire in it. The &s;tones being properly heated, they rake away the a&s;hes, and covering the &s;tones with green leaves of the cocoa nut-tree, they put their meat in plantain leaves, and place it in the pit, covering it over with the hot a&s;hes, on which they lay bread-fruit and yams enclo&s;ed in plantain leaves: the&s;e again they cover with the embers intermixed with the hot &s;tones: to this &s;ucceeds a layer of cocoa-nut leaves, and upon the whole is a covering of earth. In this manner a &s;mall hog is dre&s;&s;ed whole, but a large one is cut in two; and Cap|tain Wallis a&s;&s;erts, that this method of cookery exceeds every other he has known, the meat being extremely tender, and full of gravy. Their only &s;auces are &s;alt water and fruit, and their knives are made of &s;hells.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="114">They were a&s;toni&s;hed when they fir&s;t &s;aw meat boiled in a pot; but the Captain having given iron-pots to the Queen and &s;ome of her chiefs, they were often u&s;ed; and the old Indian fed on boiled meat almo&s;t con&s;tantly. The only liquor they drink is water: they occa&s;ionally pluck and chew a bit of the &s;ugar-cane; but have no idea of extracting any &s;pirit from it.</P>
<P>From the &s;cars with which many of the&s;e people were marked, it &s;eems evident, that they &s;ometimes waged war with each other.&mdash;That they have &s;kill in &s;urgery is evident from the following circum&s;tance: a &s;plinter having got into the foot of one of the &s;ailors, his me&s;&s;|mate tried in vain to extract it with a pen-knife: on this one of the natives, having formed an in&s;trument, with his teeth, out of a &s;hell, ex|tracted the &s;plinter in an in&s;tant; and the old Indian applying a piece of the gum of the ap|ple-tree to the wound, the man's foot was quite well in two days.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;heds on the i&s;land, enclo&s;ed within a wall, on the out&s;ide of which &s;everal po&s;ts are fixed in the ground, on which are rude re&s;emblances of men, women, dogs and hogs. The enclo&s;ed place is paved with large &s;tones, between which the gra&s;s grows. The&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to be burial-places, from the na|tives being &s;ometimes &s;een to enter them with an air of &s;olemn &s;orrow.&mdash;It could not be di&s;|covered
<PB N="105" REF="115">
that the&s;e people had any kind of reli|gious wor&s;hip among them.</P>
<P>They have three kinds of canoes&mdash;one form|ed out of a &s;ingle tree, in which they go a fi&s;h|ing; a &s;econd, made of planks &s;ewed together, and large enough to hold 20 or 30 men; in which they &s;ail round the i&s;land, and come la|den home with fruits; and a third &s;ort, which are not unlike the Venetian gondolas, and u&s;ed when they &s;ail on parties of plea&s;ure. In the&s;e they make a kind of proce&s;&s;ion two or three times in a week, with their &s;treamers flying, at|tended by the &s;mall canoes, while hundreds of the natives accompany their motions on the &s;hore. On the&s;e occa&s;ions they put on their be&s;t cloaths, and while &s;ome are under a large awn|ing, others &s;it upon it:&mdash;the&s;e are clothed in red and white; two men in red &s;it on the prow of each ve&s;&s;el; while the rowers and &s;teer&s;men are in white.</P>
<P>The people of Otaheite u&s;e bows and arrows, which la&s;t are headed with a round &s;tone. They have likewi&s;e bludgeons, and &s;lings for the throwing of &s;tones.</P>
<P>The inhabitants being &s;hewn &s;ome &s;mall tur|tles, hinted that they had &s;ome which were much larger; but not one was &s;een by any of the &s;hip's crew.</P>
<P>Captain Wallis repre&s;ents this i&s;land as one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant in the univer&s;e; being ble&s;&s;ed with a pure air, abounding in wood and her|bage,
<PB N="106" REF="116">
harbouring no venomous animal; and its inhabitants being happy in a con&s;tant flow of health. The &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, which produces fruit in va&s;t abundance, is bet|ter peopled than the &s;pot near where the &s;hip lay.</P>
<P>When captain Cook, in the Endeavour, vi|&s;ited this i&s;land, he found the venereal di&s;ea&s;e among the natives; which mu&s;t have been con|tracted from &s;ome of the crew under the com|mand of M. Bougainville; for not one of cap|tain Wallis's men were infected with that di&s;|order for &s;everal months before and after his arrival at Otaheite.</P>
<P>The Dolphin &s;ailed from this harbour on the 27th of July 1767, and pa&s;&s;ed the Duke of York's I&s;land, the coa&s;t of which abounds with plantain-trees, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and ap|ple-trees. On the 28th they di&s;covered land, which was called SIR CHARLES SAUNDER'S ISLAND. It had a few inhabitants, who lived in &s;mall huts; and the cocoa-nut and other trees grew on the &s;hore. On the 30th they again made land, which received the name of LORD HOWE'S ISLAND, on which &s;moke was &s;een, but no inhabitants. Their next di&s;covery was of &s;ome dangerous &s;hoals, to which captain Wal|lis gave the name of the SCILLY ISLANDS.</P>
<P>They now &s;teered we&s;tward till the 13th of Augu&s;t, when they &s;aw two &s;mall i&s;lands, one of which was named KEPPEL'S ISLE, and the other BOSCAWEN'S ISLAND; on the latter of
<PB N="107" REF="117">
which were &s;everal inhabitants; but they &s;teer|ed for the former, as its appearance promi&s;ed the mo&s;t convenient anchorage. By the help of gla&s;&s;es they now di&s;covered the natives on the &s;hore; but they did not attempt to anchor that night, on account of &s;ome breakers at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The boats being di&s;patched to the i&s;land, brought on board &s;ome cocoa-nuts and other fruit, and a couple of fowls. The officer re|ported, that the inhabitants were not unlike tho&s;e of Otaheite; that &s;ome few of them ven|tured into the boat, but &s;oon jumped out and &s;wam back to the i&s;land. The&s;e people were remarkable for having the fir&s;t joint of their lit|tle fingers cut off; and they were dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ort of matting.</P>
<P>As there was no convenient watering-place at this i&s;land, and as the &s;hip had received &s;ome damages that had rendered her unfit to encoun|ter a rough &s;ea, the Captain determined to &s;ail for Tinian, from thence to Batavia, and &s;o to England by the Cape of Good Hope. He therefore pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, which is well inhabi|ted, abounds in timber, and is of a circular form.</P>
<P>On the 16th they again di&s;covered land, to which the officers gave the name of WALLIS'S ISLAND. The coa&s;t of this i&s;land is very rocky, and the trees grow almo&s;t to the edge of the water. The inhabitants wore no covering but a mat round the wai&s;t: each man had a very
<PB N="108" REF="118">
large club, two of which were purcha&s;ed by the boat's crew. The&s;e people attempting to &s;teal the cutter, by hauling her upon the rocks, a gun was fired clo&s;e to one of their faces, the report of which &s;o terrified them, that they decamped with the utmo&s;t &s;peed. When the boats were returning to the &s;hip, they were im|peded by the points of rocks, which being ob|&s;erved by the Indians, they followed in their canoes till they got into deep water, and then they rowed back.</P>
<P>Captain Wallis remarks, as an extraordinary circum&s;tance, that although no &s;ort of metal was &s;een on any of the lately di&s;covered i&s;lands, yet the natives were no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a piece of iron than they began to &s;harpen it, but did not treat copper or bra&s;s in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed to the north-we&s;t, and on the 28th ob&s;erved a number of birds flying about the &s;hip, one of which they catched. It was web-footed, but in all other re&s;pects re&s;em|bled a dove. On the 3d of September they &s;aw land, which was thought to be two of the Pi&s;cadore I&s;lands; and on this day an Indian Proa (a de&s;cription of which is given in An&s;on's Voyage) made towards the &s;hip, on which they hoi&s;ted Spani&s;h Colours; but &s;he came no near|er than within about two miles. On the 7th and 9th they &s;aw &s;everal birds, one of which was taken, and judged to be a land-bird. On the 18th they di&s;covered the i&s;land of Saypan,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
and &s;oon afterwards that of Tinian, off which they anchored on the day following.</P>
<P>No time was lo&s;t in &s;ending the boats on &s;hore, and they returned in a few hours, with oranges, limes, and cocoa-nuts. Tents were erected for the &s;ick, who were &s;ent on &s;hore with all expedition. The &s;mith's forge, and carpen|ter's che&s;t were al&s;o landed; and the Captain and fir&s;t Lieutenant, who both continued ill, went on &s;hore, with a party of men to hunt for cattle. A young bull of great weight was &s;oon catched; and they found plenty of oranges, limes, and bread-fruit. On the 21&s;t they be|gan the nece&s;&s;ary repairs of the &s;hip. The fa|tigue &s;u&s;tained by tho&s;e who went to hunt for cattle was &s;o great, by going many miles thro' thickets, that one party was ordered to relieve another; and the &s;econd Lieutenant with &s;everal of the men, being &s;ent to re&s;ide on the north part of the i&s;land, where cattle were mo&s;t plen|tiful, a boat was &s;ent daily to bring in what they catched. In this i&s;land they procured beef, pork, poultry, papaw-apples, and all the other refre&s;hments, of which an account is given in An&s;on's Voyage.</P>
<P>By the 15th of October the fruit and water was carried on board, and all the &s;ick being re|covered, preparations were made for &s;ailing; and on the next day they left the bay, and &s;ail|ed to the we&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="120">On the 21&s;t and 22d they &s;aw &s;everal gannets, and other birds; and on the 23d and two fol|lowing days it blew a violent &s;torm, the effects of which were the more dreaded, as the &s;hip admitted more water than &s;he had done at any time during the voyage. The bad weather con|tinued on the 26th, when they &s;aw &s;everal land|birds. They had now to encounter the united horrors of thunder, lightning, rain, darkne&s;s, and &s;uch a violent &s;ea, as broke even the iron work on the gun-whale, and wa&s;hed over-board many heavy things. On the 27th they were ble&s;t with a &s;ight of the &s;un, and the day fol|lowing the weather became more temperate. In the middle of the night one Morgan, a taylor, was &s;uddenly mi&s;&s;ed, and it was thought he fell over-board in a fit of intoxication.</P>
<P>On the 3d of November they di&s;covered three i&s;lands, which were named SANDY ISLE, SMALL KEY, and LONG ISLAND; and on the day following they &s;aw another, to which cap|tain Wallis gave the name of NEW ISLAND; all of which i&s;lands are in ten degrees odd mi|nutes north-latitude, and 247 degrees odd mi|nutes we&s;t-longitude. The &s;hip held her cour&s;e till the 8th, on which day the log and journal-books of the voyage were taken from the infe|rior officers and forema&s;t-men.</P>
<P>They now altered their cour&s;e, and on the 13th &s;aw the i&s;lands of Timoun, Aros and Pe|lang. On the 16th they cro&s;&s;ed the equinoctial
<PB N="111" REF="121">
line, and came again into &s;outh-latitude. The next day they &s;aw the i&s;lands of Pulo Tot&eacute;, and Pulo We&s;te; &s;oon after which they had &s;ight of the &s;even i&s;lands. A &s;ingular incident hap|pened in the &s;ucceeding night, which was very tempe&s;tuous, and &s;o dark, that they could not &s;ee acro&s;s the &s;hip. During the full violence of the wind, a fla&s;h of lightning afforded them light enough to &s;ee a &s;hip of con&s;iderable &s;ize, which was &s;o near, that it was with difficulty they &s;teered clear of her; but they could not get information to what nation &s;he belonged, as the wind was too loud for them to hear each other. This was the fir&s;t &s;hip they had &s;een &s;ince they parted from the Swallow. In the morning they &s;aw the I&s;land of Pulo Taya, near which they came to an anchor in the evening; and the next morning &s;ailed again, and &s;aw two &s;hips a-head of them, but the current was &s;o &s;trong that they lo&s;t ground, and therefore they again anchored in the evening. The next day they lo&s;t an anchor, the cable of which was cut away by the rocks. On the 22d they &s;aw the coa&s;t of Sumatra, and came to an anchor in the road of Batavia, on the 30th of Novem|ber 1767.</P>
<P>On the following day captain Wallis &s;aluted the Dutch governor with 13 guns, and the com|pliment was returned from the fort with one additional gun. Permi&s;&s;ion having been ob|tained to purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, they were &s;oon
<PB N="112" REF="122">
&s;upplied with beef and vegetables. The crew were now threatened with puni&s;hment, if any attempt &s;hould be made to bring liquor aboard; and no man was permitted to leave the &s;hip, but tho&s;e who were called by duty; and even tho&s;e were not &s;uffered to go into the town.&mdash;The in|temperate u&s;e of arrack is highly pernicious to &s;trangers who vi&s;it Batavia.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Falmouth was at this time laying in the road, but in &s;o &s;hattered a condition, that it was thought &s;he could not hold together during the next mon&s;oon; nor were the few of her crew which remained alive in any better condition than the ve&s;&s;el. On the 5th of December captain Wallis received a pe|tition from the warrant officers of the Falmouth, &s;etting forth, that their powder had been thrown into the &s;ea, by order of the Dutch, and that the gunner was dead; that their mis|fortunes had deprived the boat&s;wain of his &s;en&s;es, and that he was then a lunatic in the Dutch ho&s;|pital; that his &s;tores were all &s;poiled; that the cook had been wounded, and remained a crip|ple; and that the carpenter was near death.&mdash;They therefore petitioned that the Captain would carry them to England, or, at all adven|tures, di&s;mi&s;s them from the &s;hip, as there was now nothing left for them to take charge of Captain Wallis was obliged to refu&s;e their re|que&s;t, however rea&s;onable, and informed them, that as they had taken charge of &s;tores, they
<PB N="113" REF="123">
mu&s;t wait for orders from England. To this they an&s;wered, that they had not received a &s;ingle order &s;ince they were left in the road of Batavia: that they had ten years pay due, and would rather go home &s;weepers, than remain in their pre&s;ent wretched &s;ituation. That they were never permit|ted to &s;leep on &s;hore, and when &s;ick, no per&s;on had the humanity to vi&s;it them: that the Malays frequently robbed them, and that they expected de&s;truction at the hands of tho&s;e people, as they had burnt the Siam Prize not long before the arrival of the Dolphin. They entreated the Captain to make their ca&s;e known in England, which he readily promi&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>On the 5th the Captain went on &s;hore, to buy &s;uch &s;tores as he thought nece&s;&s;ary to carry the &s;hip home with &s;afety. He vi&s;ited the differ|ent &s;tore-hou&s;es and ar&s;enals; but the demands of the Dutch were &s;o exorbitant, that he deter|mined to make &s;hift with &s;uch materials as he had, rather than be impo&s;ed on by people who wi&s;hed to take every advantage of his nece&s;&s;ity. Accordingly, he &s;ailed on the 8th of December, without lo&s;ing a &s;ingle man, and having only two on the &s;ick li&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 11th the crew began to be afflicted with colds and fluxes; and the following night they &s;aw the Coa&s;t of Java, on which was placed an amazing number of lights, intended, as they imagined, to entice the fi&s;h near the beach.&mdash;They anchored off Princes I&s;land on the 14th,
<PB N="114" REF="124">
and began to take in wood and water; at which place they remained till the 20th, during which time they purcha&s;ed turtle, poultry, and other refre&s;hments.</P>

and vegetables for the u&s;e of the crew. The &s;urgeon was &s;ent on &s;hore to hire lodgings for the &s;ick; but as the rate demanded was very high, and as the &s;mall-pox (which many of the &s;eamen had not had) raged prodigiou&s;ly, the Captain obtained the Governor's permi&s;&s;ion to erect tents on a plain about two miles from the town.</P>
<P>This being done, the &s;ick were &s;ent on &s;hore; po&s;itive orders being given that no liquor &s;hould be brought to the tents; that no one &s;hould be permitted to go into the town; and that extra provi&s;ions &s;hould be procured for tho&s;e who were mo&s;t reduced by &s;ickne&s;s. The Captain was &s;o very ill, that, as long as the &s;hip lay here, he was at a country-hou&s;e &s;everal miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Every man who was able to do any kind of work, was now employed in the nece&s;&s;ary re|pairs of the &s;hip, which being nearly compleat|ed by the 10th of February, &s;everal of the men, who had had the &s;mall-pox, were permitted to vi&s;it the town; and tho&s;e who had not had that di&s;temper, were allowed to take daily walks in the country; and as they did not abu&s;e this li|berty, it was continued to them as long as the &s;hip remained there.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;aries which could not be purcha&s;ed of the Dutch at Batavia, were bought rea&s;on|ably at this place; and fre&s;h water was procur|ed by di&s;tillation, with a view to convince the
<PB N="116" REF="126">
commanders of the Indiamen that lay here, how ea&s;ily whole&s;ome water might be procur|ed at &s;ea. This method of di&s;tillation is as fol|lows: 56 gallons of &s;alt water being put into the &s;till at five in the morning, thirty-&s;ix gallons of fre&s;h water was obtained by about a quarter after ten; thirteen gallons and a half remaining in the &s;till. This fre&s;h water was procured at the expence of &s;ixty-nine pounds of coals, and nine pounds of wood.</P>
<P>On the 25th all hands were ordered on board, when it was found that every man, except three, was able to do duty. A number of &s;heep were purcha&s;ed for &s;ea &s;tores; and the &s;hip &s;ailed on the third of March.</P>
<P>On the 17th they anchored in the bay of St. Helena, and &s;ent per&s;ons on &s;hore to get water, and others to gather pur&s;lain, of which there is great plenty. The Captain going on &s;hore, was &s;aluted by the guns of the fort; and re|que&s;ted to make that place his re&s;idence during his &s;tay on the i&s;land: but their water-ca&s;ks be|ing &s;oon filled, and the wind &s;erving the next day, they then &s;ailed for England.</P>
<P>On the 28th they cro&s;&s;ed the equinoctial line, getting once more into north-latitude. On the 24th they &s;aw the Cape of Pico.&mdash;On the 11th of May they had &s;ight of the Savage &s;loop of war, captain Hammond, in chace of a &s;loop, at which he fired &s;everal guns. On this captain Wallis fired, and brought the ve&s;&s;el to, which
<PB N="117" REF="127">
proved to be laden with brandy, tea, &amp;c. from Ro&s;coe in France; &s;he was of Liverpool, and was commanded by Robert Chri&s;tian. Captain Wallis detained her, in order to her being &s;ent to England; as &s;he was judged to be a &s;mug|gler, pretending to be bound to Bergen, in Norway, tho' &s;he was &s;ailing to the &s;outh-we&s;t.</P>
<P>No material incident happened from this time to the end of the voyage, which was happily compleated by the Dolphin coming to an an|chor in the Downs on the 20th of May 1768.</P>

<HEAD>CAPTAIN CARTERET's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD. In 1766, 1767, 1768 and 1769.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Carteret having already circumnavi|gated the globe with Commodore By|ron, was appointed to the command of the Swallow &s;loop, &s;oon after his return to England; and, on the 22d of Augu&s;t 1766, &s;ailed from Plymouth, in company with his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Dolphin, and the Prince Frederick &s;tore-&s;hip.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened till the morning of the 9th of September, (when the &s;hip lay in the road of Madeira) at which time nine prime &s;eamen left the ve&s;&s;el privately, and &s;wam on &s;hore naked, having only their money tied in handkerchiefs round their bodies. While Cap|tain Carteret was writing to the Con&s;ul to a&s;|&s;i&s;t him in the recovery of the&s;e brave, but im|prudent fellows, he received a me&s;&s;age, that they had been found naked on the &s;hore. A boat was in&s;tantly di&s;patched to bring them on board, where they cut a mo&s;t ridiculous figure, and &s;eemed heartily a&s;hamed of what they had done: it appeared, however, that they had ran this ri&s;k only to get a &s;kinful of liquor (as they &s;aid) knowing they were bound on a long voy|age,
<PB N="119" REF="129">
and it being uncertain who might live or die. Captain Carteret endeared him&s;elf very much to the crew by pardoning the&s;e men, who&s;e future &s;ervices amply repaid this well-timed lenity.</P>
<P>It will be needle&s;s to recite any particulars which happened till the 11th of April, when the Swallow parted company with the Dolphin and Prince Frederick, as already related in the account of Captain Wallis's Voyage. At nine o'clock on this day the Swallow had totally lo&s;t &s;ight of the Dolphin, which Captain Carteret judged to be then clear of the mouth of the Streights; and as the Swallow was then under land, where &s;he had not the advantage of any con&s;iderable breeze, they entertained no hope of &s;eeing their con&s;ort during the remainder of the voyage.</P>
<P>At this time all the cloth, linen, cutlery wares and trinkets were on board the Dolphin; a circum&s;tance which aggravated Captain Car|teret's di&s;tre&s;s, as he had not any thing proper to barter with the Indians; yet he encouraged the crew not to de&s;pair; and was happy to find that they were in high &s;pirits for the voyage.</P>
<P>A few hours after the &s;hips parted company, the Swallow encountered a violent &s;torm, dur|ing which there was &s;o thick a fog, that they could not &s;ee mountainous land which they were within half a mile of. At this time the boat was out in &s;earch of an anchoring-place;
<PB N="120" REF="130">
and when night came on, it was &s;o dark, that they could not &s;ee half the length of the &s;hip: they therefore hoi&s;ted lights, and fired a gun every half hour; and at length the boat reached the &s;hip in &s;afety. The next morning the boat was again &s;ent in &s;earch of a place to anchor in, and in the afternoon, when the Captain de&s;|paired of her returning in time, he &s;aw her &s;ounding a bay, and in&s;tantly making towards her, came to anchor in &s;afety.</P>
<P>The Captain now retired to re&s;t, but he was di&s;turbed in a few minutes by the &s;houting of the crew upon the deck, and the noi&s;e of tho&s;e below running to join them. His fears brought him in&s;tantly on the deck, where he heard the univer&s;al cry of the Dolphin! the Dolphin! but this flattering appearance &s;oon vani&s;hed, and proved to be only water forced up, and whirled in the air by a gu&s;t of wind from the mountains. Mr. Carteret &s;ays, that as the cur|rent &s;ets continually into the harbour where they lay, he has no doubt but it has another com|munication with the &s;ea to the &s;outh of De&s;eada. The borders of the bay abound with mu&s;cles and wild gee&s;e, and afford plenty of wood and water.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed from this place early in the morn|ing of the 15th of April, and &s;oon afterwards, by the &s;udden &s;hifting of the wind, they en|countered &s;o violent a &s;torm, that they were in danger of &s;inking; yet they did not dare to take
<PB N="121" REF="131">
in any &s;ails, for fear of running foul of &s;ome rocky i&s;lands, which in Narborough's Voyage are called the I&s;lands of Direction; nor could they go back into the Streight, without the dan|ger of running foul of a lee-&s;hore; yet, notwith|&s;tanding their be&s;t endeavours, the &s;hip made ha&s;tily towards this lee &s;hore. Thus circum|&s;tanced, they were compelled to &s;tave the wa|ter-ca&s;ks on and between the decks, that &s;he might carry better &s;ail; and by this expedient they at length e&s;caped the threatened de&s;truction. They now got into the open &s;ea, after a very providential deliverance, for, had the wind a|gain &s;hifted, the &s;hip mu&s;t have been unavoid|ably lo&s;t.</P>
<P>They now &s;teered a northward cour&s;e along the Coa&s;t of Chili; but as the water on board was deemed in&s;ufficient for the length of the voyage, the Captain propo&s;ed touching at the I&s;land of Juan Fernandes, or Ma&s;afuero, to take in a proper quantity. On the 18th the wind, which had hitherto been favourable for their &s;ailing northward, and con&s;equently getting in|to a more temperate climate, &s;uddenly &s;hifted, and continued contrary till the 18th of April, blowing violently all the time, accompanied at intervals with dreadful thunder, lightning, rain and hail.</P>
<P>During this time they &s;aw abundance of &s;ea-birds, among which were two &s;orts, one like a pigeon, which the &s;eamen called the Cape of Good Hope Hen; and the other Mother Carey's
<PB N="122" REF="132">
Chickens; but the true name of the&s;e latter is the Peterel.</P>
<P>From the 27th of this month till the 1&s;t of May they had continual &s;torms; and on this day a prodigious &s;ea laid the whole &s;hip under water for &s;ome time, while the wind blew a hur|ricane, and the rain poured down in torrents. The wind now &s;hifted, &s;o that the head of the ve&s;&s;el came right again&s;t a mountainous &s;ea, which repeatedly broke over the foreca&s;tle as far as the main-ma&s;t, &s;o that it was almo&s;t a miracle that &s;he was not &s;unk.</P>
<P>When the weather became &s;omething more moderate, they repaired in &s;ome degree the da|mage the &s;hip had &s;u&s;tained during the &s;torm; but they had much bad weather afterwards till the 9th of May, when they were in &s;ight of the I&s;land of Ma&s;afuero: and on the 10th they &s;aw Juan Fernandes, and &s;ailed round to Cumber|land Bay, on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of it.</P>
<P>The Spaniards having fortified this i&s;land (a circum&s;tance till then unknown to Captain Car|teret) a number of men were &s;een on the &s;hore, and two large boats lying on the beach. A hou&s;e and four pieces of cannon were ob&s;erved near the &s;ea &s;ide, and on the brow of a hill, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, was a fort with Spani&s;h co|lours flying on it. Many cattle were &s;een on the hills, and above 20 hou&s;es on different parts of the i&s;land. The wind blew &s;o &s;trong out of the bay, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to get
<PB N="123" REF="133">
very near it: they therefore &s;ailed we&s;tward, and were followed by one of the Spani&s;h boats; but &s;he &s;oon returned, on ob&s;erving that the wind kept them out of the harbour. On the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the we&s;t bay they &s;aw a kind of guard-hou&s;e, with two pieces of cannon, on carriages, near it. They now returned towards Cumberland Bay, when the boat again put af|ter them; but night coming on, they lo&s;t &s;ight of her. As Captain Carteret had only Engli&s;h colours on board, he did not hoi&s;t any during all this time.</P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed of the refre&s;hments they &s;o very much wanted, they &s;ailed for Ma&s;a|fuero, where they anchored on the 12th, but were unable to land, as the beach was full of rocks, and the &s;urf ran &s;o violently, that the be&s;t &s;wimmers could not get through the breakers: the next morning, however, the boats landed, and filled &s;ome water-ca&s;ks.</P>
<P>On the 15th they anchored on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the i&s;land; but were driven from their moor|ings, and kept out at &s;ea all night. In the morning the cutter was &s;ent for water, and the &s;hip got near the &s;hore, where &s;he &s;oon received &s;everal ca&s;ks, and &s;ent the cutter back for more. The long-boat was likewi&s;e di&s;patched on this &s;ervice, as well as to carry provi&s;ions to tho&s;e on &s;hore. In the afternoon the boats being ob|&s;erved running along the &s;hore, the &s;hip fol|lowed and took them in, but not without their
<PB N="124" REF="134">
&s;u&s;taining &s;o much damage by the violence of the &s;ea, that the carpenters were obliged to work all night in repairing them.</P>
<P>On the 17th the cutter was again &s;ent for wa|ter; and, when &s;he returned, the Lieutenant reported, that the violent rains which had fallen in the night, had brought down &s;uch a deluge of water, that the people on &s;hore narrowly e&s;caped drowning, after lo&s;ing &s;everal of the ca&s;ks. Mr. Gower, the Lieutenant, having &s;een many rivulets of water produced by the rain which had fallen in the night, propo&s;ed to go and fill the ca&s;ks; but he had not been long gone, before the weather began to wear a very threatening appearance, and it thundered and lightned to a degree beyond de&s;cription. The &s;hip now kept as near the &s;hore as po&s;&s;ible, and as it was grown quite dark, they were very appre|hen&s;ive that the long-boat was lo&s;t, but &s;he hap|pily came a-long&s;ide ju&s;t in time to prevent the de&s;truction of her whole crew; for &s;he had &s;carce been hoi&s;ted over the &s;hip's &s;ide a moment, before &s;uch a violent &s;quall came on, as mu&s;t inevitably have &s;unk her. Mr. Gower reported, that three of the &s;ailors having &s;wam on &s;hore with the ca&s;ks, ju&s;t before the &s;torm began, he was under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity, however unwilling, of leaving them behind, expo&s;ed, naked as they were, to thun|der, lightning, rain and hunger.</P>
<P>The&s;e men returned to the &s;hip, on the even|ing of the 19th, and gave an account how they had pa&s;&s;ed the melancholy interval.&mdash;While
<PB N="125" REF="135">
day-light continued they hoped for an opportu|nity of regaining the boat; but when the dark|ne&s;s and cold of the night advanced, they be|gan to con&s;ider how they &s;hould abide the in|clemency of the weather; when nece&s;&s;ity &s;ug|ge&s;ted an expedient that ingenuity might have &s;ought in vain:&mdash;they laid, alternately, each be|tween the two other, thus procuring at once the partial comforts of a hou&s;e and a fire. As &s;oon as the day broke they proceeded by the &s;ea-&s;hore towards the tent: but being repeatedly impeded by high points of land, they &s;wam round them, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, to avoid the rocks, that they were &s;carcely in le&s;s danger from the &s;harks: happily, however, they e&s;caped every danger, and were received at the water|ing-place with a degree of plea&s;ure that does honour to the humanity of their brother tars; part of who&s;e cloths and provi&s;ions were in|&s;tantly appropriated to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. When the&s;e men returned on board, they were indulged with a whole night's re&s;t, and the next morning were per|fectly well. The reader will no doubt be plea&s;ed to be informed, that the&s;e were three of the nine men who &s;wam a&s;hore at Madeira, for a &s;kinful of liquor.</P>
<P>This day &s;uch a quantity of fi&s;h was taken by the boat, with hooks and lines only, as was equal to the con&s;umption of the whole crew. On the 20th the &s;hip, which had been &s;ome time &s;tanding off and on near the &s;hore, came again
<PB N="126" REF="136">
to an anchor, when the long-boat being &s;ent out, procured, in a &s;hort time, an ample &s;up|ply of fi&s;h. During the night, and all the fol|lowing day, they had extreme bad weather; but, as &s;oon as it became moderately calm, three &s;eamen were &s;ent on &s;hore to kill &s;eals, and make oil of their fat, for the u&s;e of the lamps.</P>
<P>On the 22d in the morning (after a &s;tormy night) the boats being &s;ent on &s;hore, returned with a number of pintado birds, which were ob|tained from the inhabitants, who &s;aid that, when the wind blew bri&s;kly in the night, the&s;e birds flew into the fire in amazing numbers; &s;o that they catched &s;everal hundreds the preceding night. On the 23d as much water was got off as the weather would permit of, but &s;everal ca&s;ks were lo&s;t by the violence of the &s;urf. The weather now grew &s;o bad that the Captain was impatient to &s;ail: he therefore gave orders for all the people on &s;hore to come on board. At this time the &s;hip drove from her moorings, dragging the anchor after her, till &s;he got into deep water. They now lay to under bare poles, waiting for the boats, while the violence of the wind carried the water higher than the ma&s;t-head. In the evening the long-boat with ten of the men were taken on board; but there yet remained the cutter, with the Lieutenant and eighteen men. The weather becoming more moderate about midnight, the &s;hip &s;tood in for land, and at ten the next morning was
<PB N="127" REF="137">
near the &s;hore, but the cutter was not to be &s;een; about noon however &s;he was di&s;covered clo&s;e un|der land, and in three hours time her crew got on board. The&s;e people endeavoured to come off in the evening, but had no &s;ooner left the &s;hore than their cutter was almo&s;t filled with water, and narrowly e&s;caped &s;inking: at length &s;he regained the &s;hore, where &s;he remained all night: in the morning it was concluded, that the &s;hip had peri&s;hed in the &s;torm, and the crew, having taken proper methods to &s;ecure the boat, propo&s;ed to wait till the &s;ummer, when they hoped &s;he might be able to carry them to the I&s;land of Juan Fernandes:&mdash;but the&s;e thoughts were now lo&s;t in the joy of their hap|py deliverance.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Ma&s;afuero is of a triangular form, about 22 miles in circumference, and, at a di&s;tance, has the appearance of a &s;ingle rock; there is good anchorage on many parts of the coa&s;t, and the i&s;land abounds with goats. Wood and water are plenty, but difficult to be procured, on account of the violence of the &s;urf. Cod, hallibut, coal-fi&s;h, and cray-fi&s;h are to be catched in great numbers; and &s;eals are &s;o numerous, that Captain Carteret thinks, the killing of thou&s;ands could make no appa|rent difference in their numbers. The moun|tain cabbage grows on the i&s;land, which like|wi&s;e abounds in birds, among which are hawks of a very large &s;ize.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="138">Captain Carteret having left the I&s;land of Mu&s;afuero, &s;ailed to the north, with the hope of getting the &s;outh-ea&s;t trade-wind; and, hav|ing got more to the north than he fir&s;t propo&s;ed, he looked out for the I&s;lands of St. Ambro&s;e and St. Felix, which he mi&s;&s;ed through the er|roneous printed accounts of their latitudes and longitudes. They likewi&s;e &s;earched for the continent, which in the charts is called Davis's Land; but which Mr. Carteret gives many rea&s;ons for &s;uppo&s;ing has no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>This &s;earch was continued till the 17th of June, which is the depth of winter, when the weather was dark and cold, with &s;leet, rain, thunder and lightning. The gloom was &s;o con|&s;tant, that they had &s;eldom &s;un-&s;hine enough to make an ob&s;ervation, yet were nece&s;&s;itated to carry all the &s;ail po&s;&s;ible, that they might not peri&s;h with hunger before the &s;hip &s;hould reach &s;ome port, where they might procure a &s;upply of nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>On the 2d of July they di&s;covered an i&s;land, which was well clothed with trees, and down the &s;ide of which ran a &s;tream of fre&s;h water. It appeared to be about five miles in circum|ference, and was called PITCAIRN'S ISLAND, from the name of a young gentleman who fir&s;t &s;aw it.</P>
<P>On the 4th the &s;hip admitted a great quanti|ty of water, and was otherwi&s;e in a very &s;hat|tered condition, from the rough &s;eas &s;he had en|countered.
<PB N="129" REF="139">
The crew now likewi&s;e began to be much afflicted with the &s;curvy; though they were, happily, well &s;upplied with water, an abundance of the rain-water being catched by means of an awning lined with painted canvas.</P>
<P>On the 11th Captain Carteret gave the name of the BISHOP OF OSNABURGH'S ISLAND, to a low piece of land di&s;covered this day, which was well cloathed with verdure. On the 12th they &s;aw two other &s;mall i&s;lands, on one of which the boat's crew landed, and found birds &s;o tame, as to be taken without the lea&s;t difficul|ty. The other i&s;land was about 15 miles di&s;|tance; but neither of them afforded either wa|ter or vegetables. They were called the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S ISLANDS; and Captain Carte|ret &s;uppo&s;es them to be the &s;ame land which was &s;een by Quiros.</P>
<P>From this period till the 22d of the month they had alternate &s;torms and calms; and on this day judged them&s;elves five thou&s;and four hundred miles from the continent of America; yet in all this run they had &s;een no &s;igns of a &s;outhern continent.</P>
<P>As the &s;curvy was now daily encrea&s;ing among the &s;eamen; and as the weather was bad, and the &s;hip in a crazy condition, the Captain deter|mined to &s;teer &s;uch a cour&s;e as might mo&s;t pro|bably tend to the pre&s;ervation of the ve&s;&s;el and the crew. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution he &s;tood to the northward, in the hope of having
<PB N="130" REF="140">
the advantage of the trade-wind, and reaching &s;ome i&s;land, where he might be furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>On the 25th they &s;aw great flocks of birds, which induced them to think that they were near land, but they could not di&s;cover any. On the 3d of Augu&s;t great numbers of &s;ea-birds were &s;een; and on this day the current was ob&s;erved to &s;et &s;trongly to the &s;outhward, though it had hitherto ran in a contrary direc|tion; whence the Captain concluded, that the pa&s;&s;age between New Zealand and New Hol|land opened in this latitude, which was ten de|grees eighteen minutes &s;outh, and the longitude 177 degrees 30 minutes ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 10th of this month the &s;hip &s;prung a leak, in a part which they could not come at to repair; &s;o that their &s;ituation was truly alarm|ing; but two days afterwards they di&s;covered land, which gave fre&s;h &s;pirits to the almo&s;t de&s;|ponding crew. The Captain ob&s;erved &s;even i&s;lands, and &s;ailed towards two of them, which lay very near together: in the evening they came to an anchor near the large&s;t of them, on which were &s;een two of the natives, who were negroes, with woolly heads, and wore no kind of clothing.</P>
<P>A boat being &s;ent on &s;hore, an account was brought back that there was fine fre&s;h water op|po&s;ite where the &s;hip lay, but that it would be dif|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">cult to procure it, as the whole country was cover|ed

with thick wood quite to the &s;ea &s;hore. This circum&s;tance, added to the danger there might be of the natives attacking them from the woods, determined the Captain to look for a more con|venient anchoring-place.&mdash;On the day following, therefore, the cutter, with the ma&s;ter and a party of &s;eamen, was &s;ent to the we&s;tward, to &s;earch for a place to procure wood and water, to &s;eek for refre&s;hments for the &s;ick, and to di&s;|cover a place where the &s;hip might be repaired. He received orders to be &s;trictly on his guard again&s;t any attack from the natives, and took with him a few trinkets that happened to be on board, to procure their good will. The long|boat being likewi&s;e &s;ent off, &s;he &s;oon returned laden with water: &s;he was di&s;patched a &s;econd time, but the people on board the &s;hip ob&s;erv|ing &s;ome of the natives advancing to the land|ing-place, a &s;ignal was made for her to return.</P>
<P>Soon after this three of the Indians &s;at down on the &s;hore, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the &s;hip for &s;everal hours. The Lieutenant was now &s;ent to|wards them; but, when they &s;aw the boat ap|proaching, they moved along the coa&s;t, where they were &s;oon met by three others. When they had conferred together, the former went on, while the latter advanced ha&s;tily towards the boat. This being ob&s;erved from the &s;hip, a &s;ignal was made for the boat's crew to act with caution. The Lieutenant now proceeded to the &s;hore, and offered his pre&s;ents to the In|dians,
<PB N="132" REF="142">
who, regardle&s;s of his trinkets, di&s;char|ged their arrows, and immediately ran off; though the boat's crew received no injury, they fired at the natives; but the&s;e, likewi&s;e, e&s;|caped unhurt.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after this the cutter came on board; the Ma&s;ter, who commanded her, hav|ing three arrows &s;ticking in his body. The account he gave of his expedition was, in &s;ub|&s;tance, as follows. Being arrived at a place about fifteen miles from the &s;hip, he &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es, but only a very few of the natives, and landed with four of the crew well armed: the fir&s;t fears of the Indians being di&s;pelled, they accepted his pre&s;ents with plea&s;ure, and, in return, gave him &s;ome fi&s;h, yams, and cocoa-nuts. He then went to the hou&s;es; but &s;oon ob&s;erving a number of the natives among the trees, and &s;everal canoes coming round a point, he ha&s;tened towards the boat; but before he could embark, a general attack with bows and arrows was made, as well on tho&s;e in the boat, as on tho&s;e on &s;hore. Thus &s;ituated, the crew fired repeatedly, killing and wounding many of the Indians: &s;till however the latter con|tinued the fight, &s;ome of them running into the water as high as the brea&s;t; and when the boat got f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rther off &s;he was pur&s;ued by the ca|noes, which did not retreat till one of them was &s;unk, and many of the people in the others were killed.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="143">Some of the crew gave an account of this tran&s;action le&s;s favourable to the Ma&s;ter than his own: they &s;aid, that the Indians behaved in the mo&s;t friendly manner, till he exa&s;perated them by cutting down a cocoa-nut tree, after they had &s;trongly intimated their wi&s;hes that he would not de&s;troy it. The in&s;tant the tree fell they all left the &s;pot but one man, but they were &s;oon ob&s;erved to a&s;&s;emble in great num|bers among the trees; on which a Mid&s;hipman entreated the Ma&s;ter to go on board; but he &s;lighted the advice, nor even retired till the at|tack was commenced. The Ma&s;ter and three of the &s;eamen died of the wounds received from the arrows of the Indians.</P>
<P>The Captain now determined to attempt the reparation of the &s;hip in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and &s;ucceeced &s;o far that the leak was greatly reduced. On the 14th the wind &s;etting full in|to the bay, the &s;hip was driven near the &s;hore, and many of the Indians were ob&s;erved in the woods, as if in expectation of her running a|ground.</P>
<P>On the 15th a party was &s;ent on &s;hore to get water, a &s;hot having been previou&s;ly fired into the woods, to di&s;per&s;e any of the natives that might be lurking in them. The Lieutenant was likewi&s;e di&s;patched in the cutter to keep the coa&s;t clear for the waterers, by repeated firings into the woods; yet, in &s;pite of the&s;e precautions, a flight of arrows was &s;oon di&s;charged among
<PB N="134" REF="144">
them, by which one of the &s;eamen was dan|gerou&s;ly wounded. The crew now ince&s;&s;antly fired to that part of the wood from whence the ar|rows came; but the Captain made a &s;ignal for the boats to come off; and as &s;oon as he had taken them on board, fired &s;everal canon into the woods; on which a great number of the na|tives left their retreat, and ran away along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time another large party was ob&s;erved on a point of the bay, at whom a ball being fired, it fell in the mid&s;t of, and di&s;per&s;ed them. The people now took in water with &s;afety; but a con&s;tant firing was kept up, both from the &s;hip, and from a party on &s;hore; and it appeared that our countrymen had been dread|fully &s;ucce&s;sful, for repeated groans, as of dying men, were heard from &s;everal places in the woods.</P>
<P>As the Ma&s;ter was now dying of the wounds he had received by the arrows; as the Captain and Lieutenant were &s;o ill that their recovery was doubtful; and as there was no chance of procuring proper refre&s;hments at this place, all intentions of pur&s;uing the voyage farther to the &s;outhward were laid a&s;ide: the Captain, therefore, having named the place EGMONT ISLAND, and the harbour where the &s;hip had lain SWALLOW BAY, &s;ailed from it on the 17th of Augu&s;t 1767.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="145">On the &s;ame day an i&s;land was di&s;covered, which received the name of PORTLAND'S ISLAND, four miles from which they &s;aw an harbour, which was called BYRON'S HARBOUR. Having &s;ailed three leagues from the harbour, they had &s;ight of the bay where the Indians had attacked the crew of the cutter. This was called BLOODY BAY; on its borders were a number of hou&s;es well con&s;tructed, and one much longer than the others, which had the ap|pearance of a kind of hall for the tran&s;action of public bu&s;ine&s;s. In this place, which was well built, and covered with a kind of thatch, the Ma&s;ter and his party had been received by the natives, before the wanton cutting down of the cocoa-nut tree. A large number of arrows were hung in bundles round the room, the floor and &s;ides of which were covered with matting. In this neighbourhood were many gardens, &s;ur|rounded by &s;tone walls, and planted with vege|tables. Three miles from this village a large town was &s;een, in the front of which, towards the &s;ea, was an angular kind of fortification, built of &s;tone, and near five feet high.</P>
<P>About three miles from hence they &s;aw a bay, into which a river empties it&s;elf, which they called GRANVILLE'S RIVER, and it appeared to be navigable for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els far up the coun|try. The point of this bay was called FER|RERS'S POINT; and from hence the land forms a large bay, near which is a con&s;iderable town,
<PB N="136" REF="146">
inhabited by an incredible number of people, who, while the &s;hip was &s;ailing by, came out of their hou&s;es, holding &s;omething like a bundle of gra&s;s in their hands, with which they ap|peared to &s;troke each other, running in rings, or dancing, all the while.</P>
<P>Sailing onwards a few miles they &s;aw another point, which was called CARTERET POINT, on which was a large canoe, with an awning over it; at a &s;mall di&s;tance was another town, forti|fied as that before-mentioned. The inhabitants of this place likewi&s;e advanced before their hou&s;es, and danced as the others had done. The dance being ended, many of them came off in canoes towards the &s;hip: but having got near enough to have a good view of her, they would advance no farther.</P>
<P>They &s;oon &s;aw another &s;mall i&s;land, which was named TREVANION'S ISLAND, and the north part of it was called CAPE TREVANION. Both the main land and this i&s;land abounded with inhabitants; and a boat being &s;ent to &s;ound the pa&s;&s;age, they no &s;ooner ob&s;erved that &s;he had left the &s;hip, than &s;everal canoes advanced to attack her. The Indians having let fly their arrows, the boat's crew fired, and killed one man, and wounded another. A gun laden with grape &s;hot was at the &s;ame time fired from the &s;hip, on which all the canoes pulled hard for the &s;hore, except the one with the wounded man in it, which being taken to the &s;hip, the &s;urgeon
<PB N="137" REF="147">
was ordered to examine his wounds, One of this poor fellow's arms was broke, and a &s;hot had gone through his head; and the Surgeon being of opinion that the latter wound was mor|tal, he was placed in his canoe again, and with one hand rowed towards the &s;hore. His canoe was formed only of the hollow trunk of a tree: he was a young fellow, almo&s;t as black as the negroes of Guinea; his features were good, his hair woolly, and he went quite naked.&mdash;It may be fairly a&s;ked here, if it would not have been an act of humanity to have attempted the cure of this unfortunate youth, if it had been only by a &s;ingle dre&s;&s;ing, before he had been di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>As they &s;ailed along the &s;hore they &s;aw plan|tains, bananas, and cocoa-nut trees, and ob|&s;erved great numbers of hogs and poultry: but the Captain being yet very ill, and having not officers &s;ufficient to direct the men in the com|mon bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;hip, he had no opportu|nity of e&s;tabli&s;hing a friendly traffick with the Indians; and was unable to obtain by force tho&s;e refre&s;hments which the crew became every hour more and more in want of.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated; unable to proceed farther to the &s;outh, and in danger of being too late for the mon&s;oon, he gave immediate orders to pro|ceed northwards, in hope of di&s;covering the country, which Dampier has di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Nova Britannia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="148">To all the i&s;lands they had now left, Captain Carteret gave the general name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S ISLANDS; and, be&s;ides tho&s;e al|ready mentioned, he &s;aw &s;everal, which he named as follows, viz. LORD HOW'S ISLAND; KEPPEL'S ISLAND; LORD EDGCOMBE'S ISLAND; OURRY'S ISLAND; and VOLCANO ISLAND; this la&s;t being &s;o denominated from a &s;moke that i&s;&s;ued from its top, which is of an amazing height, and &s;haped like a &s;ugar loaf.</P>
<P>The canoes of the inhabitants are formed of the trunk of a tree hollowed, are large enough to contain ten or twelve people, and are furni&s;hed with out-riggers, but have no &s;ails.</P>
<P>The people of Egmont I&s;land are very ex|pert at &s;wimming and diving; and active and vigorous in a high degree. Their arrows are &s;o &s;harp, and di&s;charged with &s;uch &s;trength, that one of them wounded a man in the thigh, after pa&s;&s;ing through the wa&s;h-board of the boat. The points of the&s;e arrows are flint, and no metal was &s;een among the natives. There are good harbours on the coa&s;ts of the&s;e i&s;lands, which likewi&s;e abound in rivers, and have &s;ome vallies, but for the mo&s;t part they are moun|tainous, and covered with trees.</P>
<P>Captain Carteret &s;ailed on the 18th of Au|gu&s;t, and holding a we&s;t-north-we&s;t cour&s;e, he on the 20th di&s;covered a &s;mall i&s;land, which was called GOWER'S ISLAND, the people of which did not differ in any thing material from
<PB N="139" REF="149">
tho&s;e of the i&s;lands he had lately left. Some cocoa-nuts were here procured in exchange for nails; and the inhabitants had intimated, that they would furni&s;h a farther &s;upply the next morning; but it was then found, that the current had carried the &s;hip con&s;iderably to the &s;outh during the night, and brought them within &s;ight of two other i&s;lands, one of which was called SIMPSON'S ISLAND, and the other CARTERET'S ISLAND.</P>
<P>As both the&s;e i&s;lands were to windward of the &s;hip, they &s;ailed again to Gower's I&s;land, which abounds with fine trees, many of which are the cocoa-nut. A boat being &s;ent on &s;hore, the In|dians attempted to &s;eize her; and in return the crew made prize of a canoe, in which was a number of cocoa-nuts. The arms of the na|tives were &s;pears, bows and arrows.</P>
<P>As a &s;trong current &s;et to the &s;outhward, they now &s;teered a north-we&s;terly cour&s;e, becau&s;e the bad condition of the &s;hip, and &s;ickne&s;s of the crew, would have rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them ever to have got to &s;ea again, if they had been driven into any gulph or deep bay. On the 22d one of the marines &s;ell overboard, and was drowned, notwith&s;tanding every effort was u&s;ed to &s;ave him.</P>
<P>The &s;hip fell in with nine i&s;lands in the night of the 24th, which Captain Carteret &s;uppo&s;es to be the &s;ame that were di&s;covered by Ta&s;|man, and are named Ohang Java: eight of
<PB N="140" REF="150">
the&s;e are very &s;mall, but the other is more exten&s;ive, and they are all inhabited by blacks, who&s;e heads are woolly, like tho&s;e on the coa&s;t of Africa. The next day they had &s;ight of an i&s;land covered with verdure, which was called SIR CHARLES HARDY'S ISLAND, and from the number of fires that were &s;een on it, they &s;up|po&s;ed it to be inhabited. This day they like|wi&s;e had &s;ight of a large i&s;land, formed of three high hills, which took the name of WINCHELSEA'S ISLAND. On the 26th they &s;aw a large i&s;land to the north, which Captain Carteret imagines to have been the i&s;land of St. John, that was di&s;covered by Schouten.</P>
<P>This day they were within &s;ight of Nova Britannia, and the next morning the current drove the &s;hip into a deep bay, which, in Dam|pier's Voyages, is called St. George's Bay. On the 28th they gave the name of WALLIS'S ISLAND to a &s;mall i&s;land in a bay, off which they came to an anchor, and were now 7500 miles due we&s;t from the main land of America. The cutter was &s;ent out to catch fi&s;h; but not &s;ucceeding, &s;he returned with a con&s;iderable number of cocoa-nuts.</P>
<P>On the next day, after great fatigue, they weighed the anchor, and &s;ailed to a place which they called ENGLISH COVE, where they imme|diately began to take in wood and water. They now attempted to catch fi&s;h with hooks and lines, but none of them would bite; nor were
<PB N="141" REF="151">
they much more &s;ucce&s;sful with their nets: turtle likewi&s;e were very plentiful, yet they could not take any of them; but at low water they picked up &s;ome large cockles and rock oy&s;ters. From the &s;hore they procured cocoa-nuts, and the cabbage of the cocoa-tree, which is cri&s;p and juicy; this, when eaten raw, ta&s;tes like a che&s;nut; but, when boiled, has a more agreeable flavour than the par&s;nip. It was found to be excellent when boiled with portable &s;oup and oatmeal. They likewi&s;e gathered &s;ome plumbs, which ta&s;ted like tho&s;e of the We&s;t In|dies, which are called Jamaica plumbs; and by this &s;upply of vegetables, they had &s;oon rea&s;on to rejoice in the ble&s;&s;ing of returning health.</P>
<P>This i&s;land &s;eemed to have been lately inha|bited, as &s;everal wretched huts were &s;een, in which were the remains of fires, and the &s;hells of fi&s;h, which did not appear to have been long catched: they had likewi&s;e a &s;ight of two ani|mals, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be dogs. This place produces palm-trees of various kinds; aloes, canes, bamboos, rattans, beetle-nut, and the nutmeg-tree; with a variety of other trees, and many &s;hrubs and plants of which the names were not known. In the woods was a large black-bird, who&s;e note was not unlike the bark|ing of a dog: there were likewi&s;e parrots, rooks, pigeons and doves: they al&s;o &s;aw centipieds, &s;erpents and &s;corpions.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="152">Having taken in wood and water, and re|paired the &s;hip in the be&s;t manner they were able, the Captain took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the coun|try, with all the neighbouring i&s;lands, for the King of Great Britain. This was done by nailing on a lofty tree a piece of board faced with lead, on which was engraved the name of the ve&s;&s;el, and of the Captain, the time of entering and leaving the harbour, and a repre|&s;entation of the union flag of England.</P>
<P>They left this cove on the 7th of September, and anchored on the &s;ame day almo&s;t clo&s;e to a grove of cocoa-nut trees, where they &s;upplied them&s;elves with the fruit and the cabbage in very great abundance; and called the place CARTERET'S HARBOUR, which being formed by the main and two i&s;lands, one of them was named LEIGH'S ISLAND, and the other COCOA-NUT ISLAND.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained but to attempt the reaching Batavia while the mon&s;oon continued favourable: on the 9th of September, there|fore, the anchor was weighed, and when they were about four leagues from land, the wind and current being both again&s;t them, they &s;teer|ed round the coa&s;t into a channel between two I&s;lands, which channel was divided by another i&s;land, to which Captain Carteret gave the name of the DUKE OF YORK'S ISLAND, and near which are &s;everal &s;maller i&s;lands. To the &s;outh of the large&s;t i&s;land are three hills of &s;ingular
<PB N="143" REF="153">
form, which were called the MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS, one of which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a volcano, from the large clouds of &s;moke that were &s;een i&s;&s;uing from it. A point they called CAPE PALLISER, lies to the ea&s;t of the&s;e hills, and CAPE STEPHENS to the we&s;t; north of which la&s;t lies an i&s;land, which took the name of the ISLE OF MAN. The country in general is mountainous and woody, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to be inhabited, from the number of fires &s;een on it in the night. On the Duke of York's I&s;land the hou&s;es are &s;ituated among groves of the cocoa-nut tree, and form the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Having brought to for the night, they &s;ailed again in the morning, when &s;ome of the Indi|ans put off in canoes towards the &s;hip; but the wind being fair and blowing fre&s;h, it was not thought prudent to wait for them. Steering north-we&s;t by we&s;t, they lo&s;t &s;ight of New Bri|tain on the 11th, and it being now found, that what had been taken for a bay was a &s;treight, it was called ST. GEORGE'S CHANNEL, and the i&s;land on the north of it received the name of NEW IRELAND. In the evening they di&s;covered a large i&s;land, well clothed with vendure, which was de|nominated SANDWICH ISLAND, off this i&s;land the &s;hip lay great part of the night, during which time a perpetual noi&s;e was heard, re&s;embling the &s;ound of a drum. When they had almo&s;t cleared the Streight, the weather falling calm,
<PB N="144" REF="154">
a number of canoes approached the &s;hip, and, though they could not be prevailed on to go on board, they exchanged &s;ome little matters with the crew, receiving nails and bits of iron, which they preferred to every thing el&s;e that was offer|ed them. Though the canoes of the&s;e people were formed out of &s;ingle trees, they were be|tween 80 and 100 feet in length. The natives are negroes, and their hair is of the woolly kind, but they have neither thick lips nor flat no&s;es. They wore &s;hell-work on their legs and arms, but were otherwi&s;e naked, except that their hair and beards were powdered with white powder, and a feather was &s;tuck into the head above the ear. Their arms con&s;i&s;ted of a long &s;tick and a &s;pear; and it was ob&s;erved, that they had fi&s;hing-nets and cordage.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed we&s;t, and coming in &s;ight of the &s;outh-we&s;t point of the i&s;land, it was called CAPE BYRON; near which is an i&s;land of con&s;iderable extent, which received the name of NEW HANOVER. The Streight they had now pa&s;&s;ed was called BYRON'S STREIGHT, one of the large&s;t i&s;lands they had &s;een, BYRON'S ISLAND; and the &s;outh-we&s;t point of New Hanover, QUEEN CHARLOTTE'S FORELAND. On the fol|lowing day they &s;aw &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, which received the name of the DUKE OF PORTLAND'S ISLANDS.</P>
<P>When they had compleatly navigated St. George's Channel, the whole length of which
<PB N="145" REF="155">
is about one hundred leagues; they &s;ailed a we&s;tward cour&s;e, and on the 14th of Septem|ber di&s;covered &s;everal i&s;lands. The next morn|ing &s;ome hundreds of the natives came off in canoes towards the &s;hip, and were invited on board by every token of friend&s;hip and good will; notwith&s;tanding which, when they came within reach, they threw &s;everal lances at the &s;eamen on the deck. A great gun and &s;everal mu&s;kets were now fired at them, by which &s;ome were killed or wounded; on which they rowed towards the &s;hore; and after they had got to a di&s;tance, a &s;hot was fired &s;o as to fall beyond them, to convince them that they were not out of the reach of the guns.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time other canoes advanced ha&s;tily from a di&s;tant part of the i&s;land; and one of them coming nearer than the re&s;t, the people in it were invited on board the &s;hip; but in|&s;tead of complying with the invitation, they threw in a number of darts and lances. This a&s;&s;ault was returned by the firing of &s;everal mu&s;kets, whereby one of the Indians was kil|led; on which his companions jumped over-board, and &s;wam to the other canoes, all of which rowed to the &s;hore. This canoe being taken on board, was found to contain a turtle, &s;ome other fi&s;h, and a fruit between the apple and plumb, of a &s;pecies hitherto unknown to Europeans. The&s;e people were almo&s;t negroes, with woolly hair, which they powdered; and
<PB N="146" REF="156">
they went naked, except the ornaments of &s;hells round their arms and legs.</P>
<P>Captain Carteret now coa&s;ted along the i&s;lands, to which he gave the general name of the AD|MIRALTY ISLANDS. He de&s;cribes them as having a mo&s;t enchanting appearance, being covered with woods, groves of cocoa-nut trees, and the hou&s;es of the natives. The large&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands is computed to be above 50 miles in length; and he &s;uppo&s;es that they produce many valuable articles, particularly &s;pices.</P>
<P>They di&s;covered two &s;mall verdant i&s;lands on the 19th, which were called DUROUR'S ISLAND, and MATTY'S ISLAND, the inhabitants of which la&s;t ran along the coa&s;t with lights during the night. They had &s;ight of two other &s;mall i&s;lands on the 24th, which were called STE|PHENS'S ISLANDS, and which abounded with beautiful trees.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 25th they had &s;ight of three i&s;lands, the natives of which came off in canoes, and went on board the &s;hip. They bartered cocoa-nuts for &s;ome bits of iron, with which metal they did not &s;eem unac|quainted, and appeared extravagantly fond of it. They called it <HI>parram,</HI> and intimated, that a &s;hip &s;ometimes touched at their i&s;lands. Tho&s;e people were of the copper colour, and had fine black hair; but their beards were very &s;mall, as they were continually plucking the hair from their faces. Their teeth were even and white,
<PB N="147" REF="157">
and their countenances agreeable; their ac|tivity was &s;uch, that they ran to the ma&s;t-head even quicker than the &s;eamen. They ate and drank any thing that was given them; and had not the lea&s;t degree of re&s;erve in their behavi|our. Their dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted only of a piece of fine matting round the wai&s;t.&mdash;As the current carried the &s;hip at a great rate, the Captain had no opportunity of landing, though the Indians offered, that &s;ome of their people &s;hould remain on board, as a &s;ecurity for the &s;afe return of &s;uch of the &s;eamen as might be &s;ent on &s;hore. One of the Indians, on finding that none of the crew were to land, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to leave the &s;hip, and was therefore carried to the i&s;land of Celebes, where he died. This man was named Jo&s;eph Freewill, and the large&s;t of the i&s;lands was called FREEWILL ISLAND; but the natives called it Pegan; and the names of the other two are Onata and Onello.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 28th they di&s;covered an i&s;land from the ma&s;t-head; but they neither vi&s;ited nor gave name to it. On the 12th of October they got &s;ight of a &s;mall i&s;land, which was named CURRENT ISLAND, from the great &s;trength of the &s;outherly current; and on the following day they di&s;covered two more &s;mall i&s;lands, which were called ST. ANDREW'S ISLANDS.</P>
<P>On the 26th they had &s;ight of land, which, on the day following, they knew to be the I&s;land of Mindanao, and coa&s;ted the &s;outh-ea&s;t
<PB N="148" REF="158">
part of it, in &s;earch of a bay de&s;cribed in Dam|pier's Voyages; but they could not find it. A boat being &s;ent out, found a little nook at the &s;outhern extremity of the i&s;land, near which was a town and a fort. The boat being &s;een from the &s;hore, a gun was fired, and &s;ome ca|noes came out after it; on which the Lieute|nant retreated towards the &s;hip, and, when the canoes came in &s;ight of her, they retired in their turn.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed ea&s;tward, and, on the 2d of November, anchored in a bay near the &s;hore, whither the boats immediately went, and took in water; they &s;aw no &s;igns of that part of the i&s;land being inhabited, but a canoe being ob&s;erved to come round a point of the bay, as if to watch their motions, the Captain hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours, in the hope of tempting her crew on board; but they only took a &s;urvey of the &s;hip, and rowed off.</P>
<P>In the night a loud noi&s;e was heard from the &s;hore, very much like the war-whoop of the &s;avages of America; which, inducing Captain Carteret to think that the intentions of the i&s;landers were ho&s;tile, he ordered up his guns from the hold, and made all preparations to repre&s;s force with force. The next morning one of the boats was &s;ent on &s;hore for water, while the other was held in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t in ca&s;e of danger. As &s;oon as the crew had landed, many armed men advanced from the woods,
<PB N="149" REF="159">
one of whom holding up &s;omething white, the Captain, who had no white flag on board, &s;ent the Lieutenant on &s;hore, with orders to di&s;play a table-cloth as a &s;ignal of peace. This being done, two Indians came down to the Lieute|nant, one of whom addre&s;&s;ed him fir&s;t in Dutch, and then in Spani&s;h, in which latter tongue he was with difficulty under&s;tood. His enquiries were, if the &s;hip was a Dutch ve&s;&s;el; what number of men and guns &s;he carried; if &s;he had been to Batavia, or was bound thither; and whether &s;he was de&s;igned for war or trade.</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions being an&s;wered, he &s;aid they might go to the town, and he would introduce them to the Governor. The Lieutenant now de&s;ired that &s;ome armed Indians might retreat, and that the &s;eamen might be permitted to fill water; which was readily granted. This be|ing done, the Lieutenant pre&s;ented the Indian with a &s;ilk handkerchief, and received a coar&s;e neckcloth in return. The boats &s;oon returned to the &s;hip, with a good &s;upply of water; and Captain Carteret was congratulating him&s;elf on the pro&s;pect which the&s;e amicable appearances promi&s;ed, when he ob&s;erved &s;ome hundreds of Indians, armed with targets, hangers, broad|&s;words, pikes, bows, arrows and mu&s;kets, range them&s;elves oppo&s;ite the &s;hip:&mdash;they brandi&s;hed their &s;words, and held up their targets, in to|ken of defiance, at the &s;ame time di&s;charging their lances and arrows towards the &s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="160">Captain Carteret, &s;till re&s;olved to avoid com|ing to extremities if it were po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ent the Lieutenant again on &s;hore, to di&s;play the table-cloth, as an en&s;ign of peace. The na|tives &s;eeing that the boat had reached the &s;hore, yet that no per&s;on landed, one of them ad|vanced, and beckoned them to come to the &s;pot near where he &s;tood; which the Lieute|nant declined doing, as he would then have been within reach of their arrows.</P>
<P>The Captain having formed a re&s;olution of vi&s;iting the town, &s;ailed from hence the next morning, after having called the place DECEIT|FUL BAY: but the wind &s;oon blowing violently in &s;hore, he altered his re&s;olution, and &s;teered for Batavia.</P>
<P>The &s;outh of Mindanao is a fine country, in|ter&s;per&s;ed with woods, lawns and plantations; and abounds with inhabitants, as do likewi&s;e its neighbouring i&s;lands. Captain Carteret was of opinion, that there were Dutchmen in the town, or per&s;ons in the Dutch intere&s;t, who, finding the Swallow to be an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, had irritated the inhabitants again&s;t the crew.</P>
<P>On the 14th of November, 1767, they reach|ed the Streight of Maca&s;&s;ar, &s;ituate between the i&s;lands of Borneo and Celebes, to a point of which latter i&s;land they gave the name of HUMMOCK POINT; to the we&s;tward of which a number of boats were &s;een fi&s;hing on the
<PB N="151" REF="161">
&s;hoals. They were in &s;ight of two very &s;mall i&s;lands on the 21&s;t, which are well clothed with verdure, and deemed by Captain Carteret to be the &s;ame that are called Taba I&s;lands in the French charts.</P>
<P>On the 27th they cro&s;&s;ed the equinoctial line, and got into &s;outhern latitude, at which time they found the current &s;etting again&s;t them, and the tornadoes became violent. The crew was now dimini&s;hing by death, and weakened daily by &s;ickne&s;s; &s;o that there were hardly hands &s;ufficient to navigate the ve&s;&s;el. On the 3d of December they had &s;ight of the i&s;lands called the Little Pater-no&s;ters, which lie &s;omething more than two degrees &s;outh of the line; but it was out of their power to land any where for refre&s;hment, as the winds and currents were again&s;t them. Not a man on board was now free from the &s;curvy; and when it was ima|gined that nothing could have aggravated their di&s;tre&s;s, they were attacked by a pirate in the middle of the night of the 10th of December. It was &s;o very dark that they could not &s;ee their enemy, who attacked them with &s;wivel guns and &s;mall arms; but they returned the &s;alute &s;o warmly, that the pirate was &s;unk, and all her crew peri&s;hed, after having wounded two per|&s;ons on board the Swallow, and done &s;ome very trifling damage to the &s;hip. The pirate had been &s;een in the du&s;k of the evening; and Cap|tain Carteret afterwards heard that &s;he belonged
<PB N="152" REF="162">
to a Freebooter, who had upwards of thirty ve&s;|&s;els engaged in the dangerous bu&s;ine&s;s of piracy.</P>
<P>By the 12th of this month they had lo&s;t thir|teen of the crew; and the death of thirty others was hourly dreaded. At this time too the we&s;|terly mon&s;oon was &s;et in, &s;o that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to reach Batavia; and as they mu&s;t &s;pee|dily make &s;ome land, or inevitably peri&s;h, it was re&s;olved to attempt the getting to Maca&s;|&s;ar, a Dutch &s;ettlement on the i&s;land of Cele|bes. On the 13th they &s;aw &s;everal trees float|ing, and birds &s;itting on them: and two days afterwards they came to an anchor, at little more than a league from Maca&s;&s;ar.</P>
<P>Late that night the Governor &s;ent a Dutch|man on board the Swallow, who was greatly alarmed to find that &s;he was an Engli&s;h man of war, no &s;uch ve&s;&s;el having ever anchored there before; and &s;o apprehen&s;ive of danger was the Dutchman, that he would not venture to enter the cabin. Very early the next day the Cap|tain &s;ent a letter to the Governor, reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to buy provi&s;ions, and a&s;king &s;helter for the &s;hip, till the proper &s;ea&s;on returned for &s;ailing to the we&s;tward. When the boat arrived at the wharf, not one of her crew was permit|ted to land; and on the Lieutenant's refu&s;ing to deliver the letter, except to the Governor him&s;elf, the Shebander and the Fi&s;cal (two of|ficers of the town) came to him, and &s;aid that the Governor was &s;ick, and that they came for
<PB N="153" REF="163">
the letter by his command. Though this &s;ick|ne&s;s was believed to be mere pretence, the Lieu|tenant at length delivered the letter, which they took with them. When the boat's crew had waited &s;everal hours in the burning heat of the &s;un, and without the lea&s;t refre&s;hment, the Lieutenant was informed, that the Governor had given orders to two gentlemen to wait on Cap|tain Carteret, with an an&s;wer to his letter. While the boat lay off the wharf, it was ob|&s;erved that there was a great hurry on &s;hore, all hands being engaged in fitting out &s;uch ve&s;&s;els as were proper for war.</P>
<P>Soon after the boat came back, Me&s;&s;. Le Cerf and Douglas brought a letter, intimating, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;hip &s;hould in&s;tantly depart from the port, without coming any nearer to the town; that &s;he &s;hould not anchor on any part of the coa&s;t, and that the Captain &s;hould not per|mit any of his people to land on any place that was under the Governor's juri&s;diction."</Q></P>
<P>As the mo&s;t forcible an&s;wer to this letter, the Captain &s;hewed his dying men to the gentle|men, and again pleaded the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. They could not but &s;ee and feel the propriety of granting refre&s;hments and &s;helter to per&s;ons in &s;uch a &s;ituation; but &s;till, they &s;aid, their orders were ab&s;olute, and mu&s;t be obeyed. Provoked at this treatment, the Cap|tain declared he would anchor clo&s;e to the town; and if they then refu&s;ed him nece&s;&s;aries, that
<PB N="154" REF="164">
he would run the &s;hip a-ground, and him&s;elf and his crew would &s;ell their lives as dearly as po&s;&s;ible. Alarmed at this declaration, they begged the Captain to remain in his pre&s;ent &s;ta|tion, till the Governor &s;hould give further or|ders; and this he promi&s;ed, provided that he had an an&s;wer before the &s;ea breeze &s;et in on the day following.</P>
<P>Early in the morning a &s;loop of war, and another ve&s;&s;el, with many &s;oldiers on board, came and anchored under the &s;hip's bows. The Captain &s;ent to &s;peak with them, but they would not an&s;wer a &s;ingle que&s;tion: and as the &s;ea-breeze &s;et in at noon, he then &s;ailed towards the town, the other ve&s;&s;els weighing anchor, and keeping even pace with him.</P>
<P>A ve&s;&s;el now approached from the town, in which were &s;everal gentlemen, among whom was the Mr. Douglas above-mentioned; but none of them would go on board till the Swal|low had dropped her anchor. On their expre&s;|&s;ing &s;ome &s;urprize that the Swallow had &s;ailed from her former &s;tation, Captain Carteret told them, that he had only acted agreeable to his de|claration to them the preceding day, in which he was fully ju&s;tified by his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The&s;e gentlemen brought with them two &s;heep, &s;ome fowls, fruit, and other provi&s;ions, which were highly acceptable.</P>
<P>After they had made &s;everal propo&s;itions, which Captain Carteret could not but reject,
<PB N="155" REF="165">
he again declared his re&s;olution of putting his threats in execution, and to convince them that he was in earne&s;t, &s;hewed them the body of a man who had expired within a few hours; but who would probably have been then alive, if the refre&s;hments had been brought in time. They now enquired if the &s;hip had touched at the Spice I&s;lands; and being an&s;wered in the negative, it was at length agreed, that &s;he &s;hould &s;ail to a bay at a &s;mall di&s;tance, where an ho&s;pital might be built for the &s;ick, and where provi&s;ions were plenty, and that if any thing farther was want|ed, it &s;hould be &s;ent from Maca&s;&s;ar.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was readily embraced, on the condition that the Governor and Council &s;hould ratify it, which they afterwards did. The Cap|tain now enquiring why the two ve&s;&s;els had an|chored under the &s;hip's bows, was told, that it was only to protect her from any outrages on the part of the natives of the country. Mr. Carteret had nothing to treat his gue&s;ts with, but bad &s;alt meat and rotten bread: but, dur|ing their treaty, a very elegant dinner having been dre&s;&s;ed in the gentlemen's ve&s;&s;el, it was &s;erved up on board the &s;hip; after which they parted good friends.</P>
<P>An officer from the town coming on board the next day, the Captain applied to him to procure money for his bills on the Engli&s;h government. This he promi&s;ed to attempt, and went on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e, but, returning in the evening,
<PB N="156" REF="166">
brought word, that there was not a per&s;on in the town, who wanted to remit any money to Europe; and that the Company's che&s;t was totally drain|ed: but this difficulty was at length &s;urmounted, by an order to the Re&s;ident at Bonthain, who had money to remit to Europe, to take the Cap|tain's bills for any thing he &s;hould want.</P>
<P>On the day following Mon&s;. Le Cerf, who was an En&s;ign, brought a pilot on board, to carry the &s;hip round to Bonthain; and Le Cerf had the command of &s;ome &s;oldiers, who were on board two guard-boats that attended the &s;hip: and he was likewi&s;e to act as a check on the Re&s;ident.</P>
<P>All things being thus &s;ettled, they &s;ailed early on the 20th of December, 1767, and anchored in the road of Bonthain on the following day. The guard-boats were now moored clo&s;e to the &s;hore, to prevent all communication between the &s;hip's boats and tho&s;e of the country. Cap|tain Carteret having attended the Re&s;ident, to &s;ettle the price and mode of procuring provi|&s;ions, a hou&s;e was appropriated to his u&s;e, &s;i|tuated near a &s;mall fort. This being fitted up as an ho&s;pital, the &s;ick were landed and placed under a guard, which was commanded by M. Le Cerf, who would not permit them to go a|bove thirty yards from the ho&s;pital, nor the na|tives to traffic with the &s;eamen; &s;o that the pro|fits of traffic fell into the hands of the Dutch &s;oldiers, who&s;e gains were immoderate; &s;o great,
<PB N="157" REF="167">
indeed, that &s;ome of them &s;old at a profit of more than a thou&s;and per cent. after having ex|torted the provi&s;ions from the natives at what price they plea&s;ed. Captain Carteret having re|mon&s;trated with the Re&s;ident on the inju&s;tice of this procedure, he &s;poke to the &s;oldiers on the &s;ubject; but this produced no good effect; and it was known that, after this, Le Cerf's wife &s;old provi&s;ions at more than double the prime co&s;t, while it was &s;u&s;pected that he &s;old arrack to the &s;eamen.</P>
<P>On the 26th and 27th three ve&s;&s;els arrived, one of which had troops on board, de&s;tined for the Banda I&s;lands; but their boats not being al|lowed to go on board the &s;hip, the Captain pre|vailed on the Re&s;ident to purcha&s;e, for his u&s;e, four ca&s;ks of &s;alt provi&s;ions. Above one hun|dred &s;ail of proas arrived at Bonthain Bay on the 28th.&mdash;The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which fi&s;h round the i&s;land, carry Dutch colours, and &s;end the pro|duce of their labours to China for &s;ale.</P>
<P>On the 18th of January a letter from Ma|ca&s;&s;ar informed Captain Carteret, that the Dol|phin, his old con&s;ort, had arrived at Batavia. Ten days after this the Secretary, who had been &s;ent with Le Cerf, had orders to return to Ma|ca&s;&s;ar: on the 19th of February, Le Cerf him|&s;elf was recalled; and on the 7th of March the large&s;t of the guard-boats was likewi&s;e ordered back. On the 9th the Re&s;ident received a let|ter from the Governor of Maca&s;&s;ar, enquiring
<PB N="158" REF="168">
when Captain Carteret would &s;ail for Batavia, though he mu&s;t know it could not be before the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon &s;et in, which would not be till May. All the&s;e were &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances; and toward the end of the month it was ob|&s;erved, that a canoe frequently paddled round the &s;hip &s;everal times in the night, and retired as &s;oon as &s;he was &s;een.</P>
<P>While every one was &s;peculating on the&s;e mat|ters, the Captain received a letter, informing him that a de&s;ign was formed for his de&s;truc|tion; that the Dutch were at the bottom of this affair; but that the o&s;ten&s;ible per&s;on was to be the &s;on of the King of Bony, who was on terms of friend&s;hip with the Dutch, as they had often a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in attempts to reduce the inhabi|tants of the other parts of the i&s;land of Celebes, and had been as often repul&s;ed. The pretended grounds for this proceeding were, that the En|gli&s;h might form connections with the&s;e un&s;ub|dued natives of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Whether the information contained in this letter was true or fal&s;e, Captain Carteret put his &s;hip in the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence po&s;&s;ible. He even &s;u&s;pected that the Re&s;ident was privy to the horrid &s;cheme; but he had afterwards rea&s;on to be convinced to the contrary: though it appeared that one of the Princes &s;ubject to the King of Bony, and a mini&s;ter of that mo|narch, had been privately at Bonthain; but of
<PB N="159" REF="169">
eight hundred men, who were &s;aid to be there, no traces could be found.</P>
<P>On the 7th of May the Captain received, through the hands of the Re&s;ident, a letter from the Governor of Maca&s;&s;ar, denying his having any knowledge of the above-mentioned project, and requiring that the writer of the letter might be given up; but this requi&s;ition was not complied with, as the Captain knew he would be equally puni&s;hed, whether his infor|mation was or was not true.</P>
<P>At this place they purcha&s;ed plenty of fre&s;h provi&s;ions at moderate prices; and, among the re&s;t, beef of an excellent quality. The bul|locks of this place are tho&s;e that have the bunch on the back; and it likewi&s;e abounds in buffa|loes, hor&s;es, &s;heep, deer, and goats. The natives neither eat pork nor turtle; but they &s;old the latter, as well as other fi&s;h, to Captain Carteret.</P>
<P>Having taken in wood and water, they &s;ailed hence on the 22d of May, and, &s;teering along the &s;hore, came to an anchor the &s;ame evening, between the i&s;lands of Celebes and Tonikaky. They &s;ailed again in the morning, and at night &s;aw the &s;outhernmo&s;t of the i&s;lands of Salombo. On the 26th they &s;aw the i&s;land of Luback; and on the 29th a number of &s;mall i&s;lands called Carimon-Java.</P>
<P>On the 2d of June they had &s;ight of the land of Java, and on the following day came to an anchor in the road of Batavia, after hav|ing
<PB N="160" REF="170">
with difficulty prevented the &s;hip from &s;ink|ing, by the con&s;tant working of the pumps, during her whole pa&s;&s;age from Celebes. Hav|ing fired guns of &s;alutation, the Captain at|tended the Governor, reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to repair the defects of the &s;hip; but he was di|rected to petition the Council.</P>
<P>The Council met on the Monday following, when the Captain &s;ent a letter, &s;tating the defects of the &s;hip, and reque&s;ting permi&s;&s;ion to repair her. The time from this day till the 18th of the month was lo&s;t in altercations re&s;pecting the af|fair at Bonthain Bay; the Governor and Coun|cil in&s;i&s;ting, that Captain Carteret &s;hould &s;ign a formal declaration, that he believed the report of an intention formed at Celebes, for cutting off the &s;hip, was fal&s;e and malicious; and the Captain on his part re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;ting in his refu&s;al to &s;ign any &s;uch paper.</P>
<P>On the 18th the Captain learnt that orders had been given for repairing the &s;hip at Onru&s;t, whither a pilot attended her, and where &s;he came to an anchor on the 22d of June; but as the wharfs were pre-engaged by other &s;hips, the repairs did not commence till the 24th of Ju|ly. On examination, the ve&s;&s;el was found in &s;o very rotten and decayed a condition, that the Dutch carpenter would not undertake her re|pair, without &s;hifting her whole bottom, till the Captain had certified under his hand, that what &s;hould be done was in con&s;equence of his own
<PB N="161" REF="171">
expre&s;s direction. This the Dutchman thought nece&s;&s;ary, le&s;t the &s;hip &s;hould never reach Eng|land, and the blame con&s;equently re&s;t with him.</P>
<P>During Captain Carteret's &s;tay at this port, he frequently vi&s;ited M. Houting, an Admiral in the &s;ervice of the Dutch, a gentleman re|markable for his politene&s;s and affability, from whom the Captain received &s;everal di&s;tingui&s;h|ing marks of kindne&s;s.&mdash;The Governor of Bata|via lives with the &s;tate of a &s;overeign Prince. When he goes publicly abroad he is e&s;corted by hor&s;e-guards, and has two black footmen who run before his coach. When any other coach meets that of the Governor, it is drawn on one &s;ide, and the per&s;ons in it get out to pay their re|&s;pects; nor, if a coach is behind, mu&s;t it be driven by the Governor's, whatever nece&s;&s;ity may require its greater &s;peed. The like ho|mage is paid to the members of the Council, only that the per&s;on does not quit his carriage, but &s;alutes them &s;tanding in it; one black man, with a &s;tick in his hand, runs before the coach of a member of the Council, and thinks him|&s;elf at liberty to puni&s;h tho&s;e who do not make a proper obedience.</P>
<P>It was hinted to Captain Carteret, by the landlord of the hotel where he lodged, that his carriage mu&s;t &s;top, if he &s;hould meet the Go|vernor's, or tho&s;e of the Council; but the Cap|tain di&s;daining to pay a degree of homage to
<PB N="162" REF="172">
the &s;ervants of the States of Holland, which is not paid to the King of Great Britain, re|fu&s;ed to comply; and when the black men were mentioned, he &s;aid he knew how to defend him|&s;elf, and pointed to his pi&s;tols. In a few hours afterwards he was told, from the Governor, that he might act as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Captain Carteret having engaged &s;ome Eng|li&s;h &s;eamen, &s;ailed from Onru&s;t on the 15th of September, and came to an anchor off Princes I&s;land, in the Streight of Sunda, on the follow|ing day. Having here taken in wood and water, they &s;ailed on the 25th with a fine gale of wind, which held them during a pa&s;&s;age of 700 leagues; and on the 23d of November they came to an anchor in Table Bay in the Cape of Good Hope. The Captain having received numberle&s;s civilities from the Governor and other gentlemen of this place, &s;ailed on the 6th of January, and on the 20th anchored off the I&s;land of St. Helena, from whence he again &s;ailed on the 24th. On the 31&s;t of January they anchored in a bay off the I&s;land of A&s;|cen&s;ion, where they found an abundance of turtle, many of which were taken; and the &s;hip &s;ailed again on the following day.</P>
<P>It had been accu&s;tomed to leave on this i&s;land (which is uninhabited) a letter in a bottle, con|taining an account of the name and de&s;tination of any &s;hip which might touch there; and with this cu&s;tom Captain Carteret complied.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="173">On the 20th of this month a &s;hip which had been &s;een the preceding day far to the leeward, but had out-&s;ailed the Swallow in the night, tacked and &s;tood towards her. A boat was &s;ent on board, in which was a young officer, who, by many artful que&s;tions, endeavoured to learn from Captain Carteret all the mo&s;t im|portant particulars of his voyage; and this piece of ill manners was aggravated, by his in|venting a tale to di&s;gui&s;e tho&s;e of his own voy|age; for the ve&s;&s;el he had ju&s;t left was no other than that of M. Bougainville, which was then returning from a voyage round the world. Captain Carteret learnt this circum&s;tance after|wards from the Lieutenant; for the boat's crew, which had brought the French officer on board, had di&s;covered every &s;ecret to one of the Eng|li&s;h crew who &s;poke French. Happily, Cap|tain Carteret had kept his own &s;ecret &s;o well, that Mon&s;ieur Bougainville was not at all the wi&s;er for the time he had lo&s;t in the negotiation of this illiberal bu&s;ine&s;s. The Frenchman learnt the name of the Engli&s;h &s;hip from the letter left in the bottle at the i&s;land of A&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our adventurers had &s;ight of the we&s;tern i&s;lands on the 7th of March 1769, and came to an anchor at Spithead on the 20th of the &s;ame month, without meeting with any accident worth recording.</P>

<HEAD>CAPTAIN COOK's VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD. In 1768, 1769, 1770 and 1771.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Banks, a gentleman of con&s;iderable fortune in Lincoln&s;hire, was induced to undertake this voyage from his natural curio&s;ity, and invincible de&s;ire of attaining knowledge. He had already vi&s;ited the banks of Newfound|land and Labradore, and was now happy in having an opportunity of ob&s;erving the tran&s;it of Venus in the &s;outhern part of America. He accordingly engaged his friend Dr. Solan|der to accompany him in this voyage. This gentleman, who was born in Sweden, and edu|cated under the celebrated Linnaeus, had, from his exten&s;ive learning, been appointed to a place in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, and given the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction in that capacity. Mr. Banks al&s;o took with him two draft&s;men, one to delineate views and figures; the other to paint &s;uch &s;ub|jects of natural hi&s;tory as might pre&s;ent them|&s;elves. He had be&s;ides a &s;ecretary and four &s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="176">On the 26th of Augu&s;t, 1768, the Endea|vour &s;ailed from Plymouth, and on the 2d of September they &s;aw land between Cape Fini&s;ter and Cape Ortegal, on the coa&s;t of Gallicia in Spain. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had, du|ring this cour&s;e, an opportunity of viewing many marine animals, hitherto unnoticed; a|mong the&s;e was a new &s;pecies of an angular figure, near three inches in length and one in thickne&s;s, having a hollow quite through it, and a brown &s;pot at one end. Four of the&s;e animals were joined together; but upon be|ing put into water they &s;eparated and &s;wam about. They re&s;embled a gem in brightne&s;s, and &s;hone in the water with fine colours. There was another animal of a more beautiful and lively colour, which was not unlike an opal. About ten leagues from Cape Fini&s;ter, various birds were ob&s;erved, which had not been de&s;crib|ed by Linnaeus.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of Puerto Santo and Madeira were di&s;covered on the 12th, and the next day they anchored in Fonchial road. In heaving the anchor, Mr. Weir, the Ma&s;ter's mate, was carried overboard and drowned. Mr. Banks found at Madeira a tree, called by the natives <HI>Vigniatico,</HI> the <HI>Laura indicus</HI> mentioned by Linnaeus. The wood of this tree can &s;carce be di&s;tingui&s;hed from mahogany, which indu|ced this gentleman to believe, that the wood
<PB N="167" REF="177">
called in England Madeira mahogany, was the <HI>Laura indicus</HI>; as no mahogany is exported from this i&s;land. The only article of trade in Madeira is wine, which is made in the follow|ing manner; the grapes are put into a &s;quare wooden ve&s;&s;el, the &s;ize of which is proportioned to the quantity; then the per&s;ons employed take off their cloaths, get into the ve&s;&s;el, and with their elbows and feet pre&s;s out as much of the juice as they can; in this manner the &s;talks are then tied together, and pre&s;&s;ed under ano|ther &s;quare piece of wood, by a lever and a &s;tone, to extract the remainder of the juice. A whole vintage is frequently &s;poiled by the bad grapes being mixed with the others, which the inhabitants ob&s;tinately refu&s;e throwing out, as the quantity of wine is increa&s;ed by them.</P>
<P>There are no wheel-carriages in this i&s;land; the only re&s;emblance of them is a hollow board, that may be called a &s;ledge, and which &s;erves to carry their wine ve&s;&s;els. The &s;oil is &s;o rich, and there is &s;uch a variety in the climate, be|tween the hills and plains, that there is no ob|ject of luxury which grows either in India or Europe, that might not probably be cultivated here. Walnuts, che&s;nuts and apples, flouri&s;h almo&s;t without culture upon the hills. The pine-apple, the mango, the guava and the ba|nana, grow almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly in the town. The corn is large grained and fine, and it might be produced in great abundance; neverthele&s;s,
<PB N="168" REF="178">
the greate&s;t part of what is con&s;umed is im|ported. The beef, mutton, and pork, are likewi&s;e remarkably good, particularly the fir&s;t, which induced the Captain to take &s;ome on board. <HI>Foncho,</HI> which is fennel in Portugue&s;e, gave name to the town of Fonchial, that lies in latitude 20 degrees 33 minutes north, and longitude 16 degrees 49 minutes we&s;t. It is &s;eated at the bottom of a bay, poorly built, though exten&s;ive in proportion to the i&s;land; the &s;treets are narrow, and very badly paved. In the churches there are great numbers of or|naments, with pictures and images of &s;aints; the fir&s;t are, for the mo&s;t part, done by mere daubers, and the latter are cloathed in laced habits. A better ta&s;te prevails in &s;ome of the convents, particularly that of the Franci&s;cans; here &s;implicity and neatne&s;s unite, and give us a very favourable idea of the&s;e good fathers. The infirmary is al&s;o a building that does ho|nour to the architect, and is the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able edifice in the whole place. There are ma|ny very high hills; Pico Ruivo is near 5100 feet in height, perpendicularly from its ba&s;e. The&s;e hills are covered round with vines to a certain height, above which there are great numbers of che&s;nut and pine trees, and above them various &s;orts of timber, &s;o thick as to form fore&s;ts. The <HI>Mirmulano</HI> and <HI>Paobranco,</HI> which are found among&s;t them, are unknown in Eu|rope. The latter is very beautiful, and would
<PB N="169" REF="179">
be greatly ornamental in our gardens. The in|habitants are computed to be between 70 and 80,000; and the revenue ari&s;ing from the cu&s;toms is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to 20 or 30,000 pound &s;terling per annum. Water, wine, fruit and onions, are here in plenty; &s;weat-meats are al&s;o to be had without any difficulty; but permi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be obtained from the Go|vernor for poultry and fre&s;h meat. The En|deavour &s;ailed from Madeira September 19. On the 22d they &s;aw the I&s;lands of Salvages, northward of the Canaries. The chief of the&s;e i&s;lands was about 5 leagues to the &s;outh one half we&s;t. The&s;e i&s;lands appear to lie in latitude 30 degrees 11 minutes north. On the 23d they &s;aw the Peak of Teneriffe, bearing we&s;t by &s;outh. This mountain is near 15,400 feet high. On the 29th they &s;aw Bona Vi&s;ta, one of the Cape de Verd I&s;lands, lying in latitude 16 degrees north, and longitude 21 degrees 48 minutes we&s;t. From Teneriffe to Bona Vi&s;ta they ob&s;erved flying fi&s;h in great numbers, which appeared very beautiful, their &s;ides re|&s;embling burni&s;hed &s;ilver. Mr. Banks went out in a boat on the 7th of October, and caught what is called a Portugue&s;e man of war, together with &s;everal marine animals of the <HI>Molu&s;ca</HI> tribe. They had now variable winds, with &s;ome &s;how|ers of rain; and the dampne&s;s of the air did great injury to their iron uten&s;ils. October

<P>They cro&s;&s;ed the line with the u&s;ual ceremo|nies on the 25th of October.</P>
<P>When the Endeavour was, on the 28th of October, in the latitude of Ferdinand Noron|ha, and in longitude 32 degrees 5 minutes we&s;t, they looked out for the i&s;land, and the &s;hoals which, according to the charts, lie between it and the main; but neither the i&s;land or the &s;hoals could be di&s;covered. On the 29th, in the evening, they &s;aw the luminous appearance of the &s;ea, mentioned by navigators: it emit|ted rays of light, re&s;embling tho&s;e of lightning. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, not being inclin|ed to adopt any of the opinions that had pre|vailed with regard to the cau&s;es of this luminous appearance (&s;uch as its being cau&s;ed by fi&s;h darting at its prey, by the putrefaction of fi&s;h and other inhabitants of the &s;ea, and even by electricity) threw out a ca&s;ting-net, when they were confirmed in their &s;ugge&s;tion, that it was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome luminous animal. A &s;pe|cies of the <HI>medu&s;a</HI> was caught, which re&s;em|bled a metallic &s;ub&s;tance greatly heated, emit|ting a whiti&s;h light. Some crabs were brought up at the &s;ame time, which, though exceeding &s;mall, gave a very glittering appearance. The&s;e animals had hitherto e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of all naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="181">Provi&s;ions beginning to fall &s;hort, it was de|termined to put into Rio de Janeiro. They &s;aw the coa&s;t of Brazil on the 8th of Novem|ber, and &s;poke with the people on board a Por|tugue&s;e fi&s;hing-boat, who informed them, that the land which they &s;aw was to the &s;outh of <HI>Sancto E&s;pirito.</HI> Mr. Banks bought &s;ome fi&s;h of the people in the boat, and was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find that they refu&s;ed Spani&s;h &s;ilver, and wanted Engli&s;h &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Their interpreters, who were a Venetian and Portugue&s;e, informed them, that the crew of the fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;el declared, they had not &s;een a &s;hip for eight years; this however they &s;up|po&s;ed to be a mi&s;take, as they &s;poke &s;uch im|perfect Engli&s;h, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>On the 13th, in the morning, we made &s;ail for the harbour of Rio de Janeiro. Mr. Hicks, the fir&s;t Lieutenant, was &s;ent before in the pin|nace to the city, to inform the Governor, we put in there for refre&s;hments and water, and to obtain a pilot. The pinnance returned with|out the Lieutenant, who was detained by the Viceroy till the Captain came on &s;hore. When the Endeavour came to an anchor, a ten-oared boat filled with &s;oldiers came up, and rowed round the &s;hip, without any conver&s;ation taking place. Soon after another boat came up, with &s;everal of the Viceroy's officers; they enquired
<PB N="172" REF="182">
whence the Endeavour came; what her cargo con&s;i&s;ted of; her number of men and guns; and her de&s;tination. The&s;e and &s;everal other que&s;tions were ju&s;tly an&s;wered without equivo|cation; when they apologized for detaining the Lieutenant, and the other &s;teps they had taken, pleading its being cu&s;tomary.</P>
<P>Captain Cook went on &s;hore on the 14th, and obtained leave to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions, on condition of employing an inhabitant as a fac|tor: to this the Captain objected, but in vain, as well as to the &s;ending a &s;oldier in the boat every time &s;he went from the &s;hore to the &s;hip. Having reque&s;ted, that the gentlemen on board might remain on &s;hore whil&s;t they &s;ojourned, and that Mr. Banks might go up the country to collect plants; the&s;e reque&s;ts were peremptori|ly refu&s;ed. Captain Cook judging the Viceroy imagined they were come to trade, the Captain endeavoured to convince him of his mi&s;take, by acquainting him, that they were bound to the &s;outhward, to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Ve|nus over the &s;un; a very intere&s;ting object to the advancement of navigation, of which phenomenon he appeared to be totally ignorant. An officer was appointed to attend the Captain; this, which he was told was meant as a com|pliment, he would have declined; but the Vice|roy was too polite to allow his di&s;pen&s;ing with the honour.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="183">Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were greatly di&s;appointed upon the Captain's return, to find they were not permitted to re&s;ide on &s;hore, and go up the country; and their chagrin was &s;till far|ther increa&s;ed, to hear they were not allowed even to leave the &s;hip; the Viceroy having ordered, that only the Captain, and &s;uch &s;ailors as were nece&s;&s;ary to be upon duty, &s;hould be &s;uffered to come on &s;hore; probably its being reported, that the&s;e gentlemen came upon this voyage to make di&s;coveries and ob&s;ervations, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed extraordinary abilities for &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, might occa&s;ion the&s;e rigid orders. They at|tempted, neverthele&s;s, to come on &s;hore, but were prevented by the guard-boat; though &s;e|veral of the crew, unknown to the centinel, &s;tole out of the cabin window at midnight, let|ting them&s;elves down by a rope into the boat, and driving away by the tide till they were out of hearing; they then rowed to &s;ome unfrequented part of the &s;hore, where they landed, and made excur&s;ions up the country, though not &s;o far as they could have wi&s;hed. When the Captain went on &s;hore to remon|&s;trate with the Viceroy re&s;pecting the&s;e re|&s;trictions, the only an&s;wer that could be obtained was, that he acted in con&s;equence of his Ma&s;ter's orders. Thus &s;ituated, the Cap|tain re&s;olved to go no more on &s;hore, rather than be a pri&s;oner in his own boat, as the officer, who complimented him with his company, wait|ed
<PB N="174" REF="184">
upon him both from and to the &s;hore. It was now re&s;olved to draw up two memorials to the Viceroy; one was written by the Captain, the other by Mr. Banks: they produced an|&s;wers no way &s;atisfactory. Captain Cook and Mr. Banks replied, and &s;everal written remon|&s;trances and an&s;wers pa&s;&s;ed between them and the Viceroy, but to no purpo&s;e. The Captain judging it nece&s;&s;ary, in vindication of his com|pliance, to urge the Viceroy to &s;ome act of force in the execution of his orders, he &s;ent Lieutenant Hicks with a packet (on the 20th) ordering him not to allow a guard in his boat. The officer of the guard-boat finding the Lieu|tenant re&s;olved to obey the Captain's com|mand, did not oppo&s;e him by force, but ac|companying the Lieutenant on &s;hore, went to the Viceroy, and acquainted him with what had pa&s;&s;ed, which induced his Excellency to refu&s;e opening the packet, commanding the Lieute|nant to return. He found a guard had been put on board his boat in his ab&s;ence, and in&s;i&s;t|ed upon the &s;oldiers quitting it. The officer now &s;eized the boat's crew, and conducted them to pri&s;on, under an e&s;corte; and the Lieute|nant was &s;ent back to the &s;hip under a guard. When Mr. Hicks had acquainted the Captain with the&s;e tran&s;actions on &s;hore, the latter wrote to the Viceroy, demanding his boat and men, and inclo&s;ed the memorial, which he would not receive from the hands of the Lieutenant.
<PB N="175" REF="185">
The bearer of this expre&s;s was a petty officer, in order to avoid continuing the di&s;pute about a guard, which a commi&s;&s;ioned officer mu&s;t have kept up. Having delivered his packet, an an&s;wer was promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the interim, in a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind, the long-boat, with four pipes of rum (by the rope breaking that was thrown her from the &s;hip) went a-drift windward of her, with a &s;mall &s;kift of Mr. Banks's that was fa&s;tened to her. The misfortune was &s;till greater as the pinnace was on &s;hore. The yawl was manned immediately, but did not return till next morning, when &s;he brought all the people on board. From them Captain Cook learnt, that the long-boat hav|ing filled with water, they had brought her to a grappling, and quitted her, and falling in with a reef of rocks on their return, they were com|pelled to cut a-drift the little boat belonging to Mr. Banks. In this &s;ituation the Captain di&s;|patched another letter to the Viceroy, acquaint|ing him with the accident, at the &s;ame time de|&s;iring he would a&s;&s;i&s;t them with a boat to reco|ver their own: this was accompanied with a fre&s;h demand of the pinnace and her crew. His Excellency at length complied with both the reque&s;t and demand; and the &s;ame day they fortunately recovered the long-boat and &s;kift. In the Viceroy's an&s;wer to the Captain's remon|&s;trance, he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts of the En|deavour being a King's &s;hip, and accu&s;ed the
<PB N="176" REF="186">
crew of &s;muggling. Mr. Banks's &s;ervants had, its true, by &s;tratagem, got on &s;hore (the 22d) early in the morning, and remained till night, but brought on board only plants and in|&s;ects. In Mr. Cook's reply, he &s;aid he was willing to &s;hew his Excellency his commi&s;&s;ion again, the Viceroy having already &s;een it; and that if any attempt to carry on a contraband trade &s;hould be repeated, de&s;ired his Excellency would take the offender into cu&s;tody. Thus terminated the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks (on the 26th in the morning) artfully eluded the vigilance of the guard, and went on &s;hore: he avoided the town, and pa&s;&s;ed the day in the fields, where the chief objects of his curio&s;ity lay. The people behaved with civility, invited him to their habitations, and he purcha&s;ed a young pig for eleven &s;hillings, and &s;ome other things. But the next day it was reported, that &s;earch was making for him and Dr. Solander, which induced them to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of going again on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Being prepared for &s;ea, with water and pro|vi&s;ions, they took on board a pilot the 1&s;t of December, but the wind being contrary, they were prevented getting out. The next day a Spani&s;h packet arrived from Buenos Ayres, for Spain, when the Captain politely offered to take Mr. Cook's di&s;patches to Europe; and he accordingly &s;ent, by that conveyance, all the pa|pers that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and the Vice|roy,
<PB N="177" REF="187">
leaving duplicates with his Excellency for his court.</P>
<P>The Endeavour did not get under &s;ail till the 7th, when having pa&s;&s;ed the Fort the pilot was di&s;charged, and the guard boat quitted them at the &s;ame time. During the la&s;t three or four days of their remaining at Rio de Janeiro, the air was covered with butterflies, chiefly of one kind.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations of the writer of the fir&s;t account of this voyage, we have the follow|ing de&s;cription of the town and country. Rio de Janeiro, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been thus named on account of its being di&s;cover|ed on the fe&s;tival of &s;aint Januarius. The town, which is the capital of the dominions of the Portugue&s;e, in America, borrows its name from the river Januarius.</P>
<P>It is &s;ituated on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, from which it extends it&s;elf about three quar|ters of a mile. The ground on which it &s;tands is a level plain; it is defended on the north &s;ide by a hill that extends from the river, leav|ing a &s;mall plain, which contains the &s;uburbs and the King's dock. On the &s;outh &s;ide is ano|ther hill, running towards the mountains which are behind the town. Some of its &s;treets run parallel from north to &s;outh, and are inter&s;ected by others at right angles. The principal &s;treet is near an hundred feet in width, and extends from St. Benedict to the foot of Ca&s;tle-hill;
<PB N="178" REF="188">
the other &s;treets are commonly twenty or thirty feet wide. The hou&s;es adjoining to the principal &s;treet have three &s;tories, but in other places they are very irregular, though built after the &s;ame manner as in Li&s;bon. In the town are four con|vents; the fir&s;t is that of the Benedictines, &s;i|tuated near its northern extremity; this &s;truc|ture affords an agreeable pro&s;pect, and con|tains an elegant chapel, which is ornamented with &s;everal valuable paintings. The &s;econd is that of the Carmelites, which forms the centre angle of the royal &s;quare, and fronts the har|bour; its church had fallen &s;ome time before, but it is again rebuilding in a very elegant man|ner, with fine free-&s;tone brought thither from Li&s;bon. The third is that of St. Anthony, &s;i|tuated on the point of a hill on the &s;outh &s;ide of the town; before this convent &s;tands a large ba&s;on of brown granite, in the form of a pa|rallelogram, which is employed in wa&s;hing. The fourth is &s;ituated at the ea&s;tern extremity of the town, and was formerly the Je&s;uits con|vent, but is now converted into a military ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The Viceroy's palace forms the right angle of the royal &s;quare: the palace, mint, &s;tables, goal, &amp;c. compo&s;e but one large building, which has two &s;tories, and is ninety feet from the water. In pa&s;&s;ing through the palace, the fir&s;t entrance is to a large hall or guard-room, to which there is an a&s;cent of three or four &s;teps.
<PB N="179" REF="189">
In the guard-room are &s;tationed the body guards who attend the Viceroy, and are relieved every morning between eight and nine. Adjoining to the hall are the &s;tables, the pri&s;on being in the back part of the building. Within the guard-room is a flight of &s;tairs for a&s;cending to the upper &s;tory; this divides at a landing-place about half way, and forms two branches, one leading to the right, and the other to the left. The former enters a &s;aloon, where there are two officers in con&s;tant attendance; the Viceroy's aid-du-camp at the &s;ame time waiting in an anti|chamber to receive me&s;&s;ages and deliver orders.</P>
<P>The left wing of the royal &s;quare is an irre|gular building, which con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of &s;hops occupied by trading people. In the center of the &s;quare is a fountain &s;upplied with water from a &s;pring at the di&s;tance of three miles, from which it is brought by an aqueduct. From this fountain both the &s;hipping and inhabitants are &s;upplied with water, the place being con|tinually crowded with negroes of both &s;exes waiting to fill their jars. At every corner of the &s;treets is an altar. The market place ex|tends from the north-ea&s;t end of the &s;quare a|long the &s;hore; and this &s;ituation is very con|venient for the fi&s;hing-boats, and tho&s;e who bring vegetables from the other &s;ide of the river to market. Negroes are almo&s;t the only people employed in &s;elling the different
<PB N="180" REF="190">
commodities expo&s;ed in the market, and they employ their lei&s;ure time in &s;pinning of cotton.</P>
<P>Without the Je&s;uits college on the &s;hore is a village called Neu&s;tra Seignora del Gloria, which is joined to the town by a very few intervening hou&s;es. Three or four hundred yards within the Je&s;uits convent &s;tands a very high ca&s;tle, but it is falling to decay. The bi&s;hop's palace is about three hundred yards behind the Bene|dictine convent, and contiguous to it is a ma|gazine of arms, &s;urrounded by a rampart.</P>
<P>The gentry here keep their chai&s;es, which are drawn by mules; the ladies however u&s;e a &s;e|dan chair, boarded before and behind, with curtains on each &s;ide, which is carried by two negroes, depending from a pole connected to the top of the chair by two iron rods coming from under its bottom, one on each &s;ide, and re&s;ting at the top. The inhabitants likewi&s;e u&s;e ham|mocks or rajas, &s;upported in the &s;ame manner, and &s;urrounded with curtains.</P>
<P>In this town the apothecaries &s;hops commonly &s;erve the purpo&s;es of a coffee-hou&s;e, people meet|ing in them to drink capillaire, and play at back-gammon. The gentry when &s;een abroad are well dre&s;&s;ed, though at home they are but loo&s;ely covered: the &s;hopkeepers have com|monly &s;hort hair, and wear linen jackets with &s;leeves. Beggars, who infe&s;t the &s;treets of
<PB N="181" REF="191">
mo&s;t European cities, are not to be found in this.</P>
<P>With regard to the women, it is on all hands agreed, that the females of the Portugue&s;e and Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in South America, are le&s;s aver&s;e to granting amorous favours, than tho&s;e of any other civilized part of the globe. Ac|cording to Dr. Solander's account, as &s;oon as the evening began, females appeared on all &s;ides in every window, and particularized tho&s;e of the male &s;ex they liked by giving them no&s;e|gays; the Doctor and two other gentlemen re|ceived &s;o many of the&s;e bouquets, that they threw handfuls away.</P>
<P>The climate of Rio de Janeiro is both agreeable and healthy, being free from many inconveni|encies that are incident to other tropical coun|tries. The air is but &s;eldom immoderately hot, as the &s;ea breeze con&s;tantly begins to blow about ten o'clock in the morning, and continues until night, when it is generally &s;ucceeded by a land wind, though this does not always happen. The &s;ea&s;ons are divided into rainy and dry; though their &s;tationary periods have lately be-become very irregular and uncertain: indeed the rainy &s;ea&s;ons had almo&s;t entirely failed the four years preceding their arrival, at which time the rains had ju&s;t begun, and they fell in large quantities during their &s;tay: formerly the &s;treets have been overflowed by the rain, and rendered impa&s;&s;able except with canoes.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="192">The adjacent country is mountainous, and chiefly covered with wood, but a &s;mall part of it appearing to be cultivated. The &s;oil near the town is loo&s;e and &s;andy, but farther from the river it is a fine black mould. It produces all the tropical fruits, &s;uch as oranges, lemons, limes, melons, mangoes, cocoa-nuts, &amp;c. in great abundance, and without much cultivation; a circum&s;tance which is very agreeable to the inhabitants, who are very indolent.</P>
<P>The mines, which lie far up in the country, are very rich; but their &s;ituation is concealed, and nobody can view them, except tho&s;e who work in them. The experiment is very dan|gerous, for every one found upon the road which leads to them is hung upon the next tree, unle&s;s he can give a &s;atisfactory account of the cau&s;e of his being in that &s;ituation. About twelve months before their arrival, the govern|ment had detected &s;everal jewellers in carrying on an illicit trade for diamonds with the &s;laves in the mines; and immediately after a law pa&s;&s;ed, making it felony to work at the trade, or have any tools in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the civil officers having indi&s;criminately &s;eized on all that could be found. Near forty thou&s;and negroes are an|nually imported to dig in the mines; the&s;e works are &s;o pernicious to the human frame, and oc|ca&s;ion &s;o great a mortality among&s;t the poor wretches employed in them, that in the year
<PB N="183" REF="193">
1766 twenty thou&s;and more were draughted from the town of Rio, to &s;upply the deficiency of the former number.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice in the town, at all of which the Viceroy pre&s;ides; in criminal cau&s;es the &s;entence is regulated by a majority of voices in the &s;upreme court. The Viceroy has a Council appointed from Europe by the king, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his private depart|ment, where he has two voices.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro maintain a whale-fi&s;hery, which &s;upplies them with lamp-oil. They import their brandy from the Azores, their &s;laves and Ea&s;t India goods from their &s;ettlements in Africa, their wine from Madeira, and their European goods from Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>The current coin is Portugue&s;e, which is &s;truck here; the &s;ilver pieces are called Petacks, of different value; and the copper are five and ten ree pieces.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro is very u&s;eful for &s;hips that are in want of refre&s;hment; the harbour is &s;afe and commodious, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a remarkable hill, in the &s;hape of a cone, at the we&s;t point of the bay. The entrance is not wide, but it is ea&s;y, from the &s;ea breeze, which prevails from noon to &s;un-&s;et, for any &s;hip to enter before the wind. The entrance of the narrow part is defended by two forts, La Cruz and Lozia; they are about three quarters of a
<PB N="184" REF="194">
mile from each other. The bottom being rocky, renders it dangerous to anchor here, but this may be avoided by keeping the middle of the channel. The whole coa&s;t abounds with a very great variety of fi&s;h, among which are dolphins and mackrel.</P>
<P>On the 9th of December they took out of the &s;ea an incredible number of atoms, of a yel|lowi&s;h colour, few of them more than the 50th part of an inch in length; it could not even with a micro&s;cope be determined whether they were animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances. The&s;e atoms tinged the &s;ea in &s;uch a manner, as to cover it with broad &s;treaks of a colour &s;imilar to them&s;elves, the greate&s;t part of a mile in length, and &s;everal hundred yards in width.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, December 8, 1768, having procured all nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, they left Rio de Janeiro; they did not meet with any material occurrence from this time to the 22d, when they di&s;covered numerous birds of the Pro&s;illaria genus, in latitude 39 degrees 37 minutes &s;outh, and lon|gitude 49 degrees 16 minutes we&s;t; they were al&s;o frequently &s;urrounded by great numbers of porpoi&s;es, of a &s;ingular &s;pecies, which were about fifteen feet in length, and of an a&s;h-co|lour. On the 23d they ob&s;erved an eclip&s;e of the moon; and about &s;even o'clock in the morning a &s;mall white cloud appeared in the we&s;t, from which a train of fire i&s;&s;ued, extend|ing
<PB N="185" REF="195">
it&s;elf we&s;terly: about two minutes after they heard two di&s;tinct loud explo&s;ions, imme|diately &s;ucceeding each other like canon, after which the cloud &s;oon di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>On the 24th they caught a large loggerhead tortoi&s;e, weighing one hundred and fifty pounds. They likewi&s;e &s;hot &s;everal birds, among which was an albetro&s;s, mea&s;uring between the tips of its wings nine feet and an inch; and from its beak to the tail two feet one inch and an half. On the 30th they ran upwards of fifty leagues, through va&s;t numbers of land in&s;ects, &s;ome in the air, and others upon the water; they ap|peared to re&s;emble exactly the flies that are &s;een in England, though they were thirty leagues from land, and &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;ects never quit it beyond a few yards. Captain Cook imagined he was at this time nearly oppo&s;ite to the bay called Sans fond (without bottom) where it is &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome writers, that the continent of America is divided by a pa&s;&s;age; but it was the opinion of the gentlemen on board, that there might be a large river, which probably had occa&s;ioned an inundation. The 31&s;t they had much thunder, lightning, and rain: this and the three following days they &s;aw &s;everal whales, and likewi&s;e &s;everal birds, about the &s;ize of a pidgeon, with white bellies and grey beaks.</P>
<P>January 4, 1769, they &s;aw an appearance of land, which they mi&s;took for Pepys' i&s;land;
<PB N="186" REF="196">
but on their &s;tanding towards it, it proved, what the &s;ailors call a Fog Bank. The &s;hip's crew were about this time, on their complain|ing of cold, furni&s;hed with each a pair of trow|&s;ers, and a jacket made of the &s;tuff called Fear|nought. They &s;aw on the 11th, after pa&s;&s;ing Falkland's I&s;land, at about four leagues di&s;|tance, Terra Del Fuego. Smoke was perceived, which they took for a &s;ignal, as it did not con|tinue after they had pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;hore to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. On the 14th they entered the &s;treight of Le Maire; but the tide being again&s;t them, they were driven out with great violence, and the waves ran &s;o high, that the &s;hip's bow|&s;prit was frequently under water; at length however they got anchorage, at the entrance of a little cove, which Captain Cook called ST. VINCENT'S BAY.</P>
<P>The weeds, which here grow upon rocky ground, are very remarkable; they appear above the &s;urface in eight and nine fathoms water; the leaves are four feet in length, and many of the &s;talks, though not more than an inch and a half in circumference, above 100. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander having been on &s;hore &s;ome hours, they returned with more than a hundred different plants and flowers, hitherto unnoticed by the European botani&s;ts. The country in general near the bay was flat, and the bottom particularly was a plain covered with gra&s;s; here was plenty of wood, water and fowl, winter's
<PB N="187" REF="197">
bark was found in great abundance. The trees are a &s;pecies of the birch, but are neither lofty nor large; the wood is white, and they bear a &s;mall leaf. Here are al&s;o white and red cran|berries.</P>
<P>Sunday 15, having anchored in 12 fathoms, upon coral rocks, before a &s;mall cove, di&s;tant from &s;hore about a mile, two of the natives came down upon the beach, in expectation that they would land; but this &s;ituation affording little &s;helter, the Captain got under &s;ail again, and the natives retired.</P>
<P>About two o'clock they anchored in the bay of Good Succe&s;s, and the Captain went on &s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to &s;earch for a watering-place, and confer with the Indians. The&s;e gentlemen proceeded about a hundred yards before the Captain, when two of the Indians having advanced forward and &s;eated them&s;elves, they ro&s;e, upon Mr. Banks and the Doctor's coming up, and each of them threw away a &s;mall &s;tick, which they had be|fore in their hands; this they did in &s;uch a direction, that the &s;ticks flew both from them|&s;elves and the &s;trangers, which they meant as a token of peace, and a te&s;timonial of their re|nouncing weapons; they then returned bri&s;kly towards their companions, who had remained at &s;ome di&s;tance behind, and made &s;igns to the &s;trangers to advance, which they accord|ingly complied with. The reception the gen|tlemen
<PB N="188" REF="198">
met with was friendly, though the man|ner was uncouth. The civility was returned, by the di&s;tribution of beads and ribbons, with which the Indians were much plea&s;ed. After a mutual confidence had been thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h party joined, and a ge|neral conver&s;ation, though of a &s;ingular kind, en&s;ued. Three of the Indians now returned with the Captain and his friends to the &s;hip, whom they cloathed with jackets, and gave them bread, jerked beef, &amp;c. part of which they eat, and carried the remainder on &s;hore. They refu&s;ed to drink rum or brandy, after ta&s;ting them, intimating by &s;igns that it burnt their throats. This circum&s;tance may perhaps corroborate the opinion of tho&s;e who think wa|ter the natural drink of mankind, as of all other animals. One of the&s;e Indians made &s;e|veral long and loud &s;peeches, though no part of either was intelligible to any of us. Ano|ther of them &s;tole the covering of a globe, which he concealed under his &s;kin garment. After remaining on board about two hours, they returned on &s;hore, Mr. Banks accompanying them. He conducted them to their compani|ons, who appeared no way curious to know what their friends had &s;een, and the latter were as little di&s;po&s;ed to relate as the others were to enquire. None of the&s;e people exceeded five feet ten inches in height, yet their bodies ap|peared large and robu&s;t, though their limbs
<PB N="189" REF="199">
were &s;mall. They had broad flat faces, low foreheads, high cheeks, no&s;es inclining to flat|ne&s;s, wide no&s;trils, &s;mall black eyes, large mouths, &s;mall but indifferent teeth, and black &s;trait hair, falling down over their ears and forehead, which was commonly &s;meared with brown and red paints; and, like all the original natives of America, they were beardle&s;s. Their garments were the &s;kins of guanicos and &s;eals, which they wrapped round their &s;houlders. The men likewi&s;e wear on their heads a bunch of yarn, &s;pun from the wool of guanicos, which falls over their foreheads, and ties behind with the &s;inews or tendons of &s;ome animal. Many of both &s;exes were painted in different parts of their bodies, with red, white, and brown co|lours; and had al&s;o three or four perpendicu|lar lines pricked acro&s;s their cheeks and no&s;es. The women have a &s;mall &s;tring tied round each ancle, and wear each a flap of &s;kin tied round the middle. They carry the children on their backs, and are generally employed in dome&s;tic labour and drudgery.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, attended by &s;ervants, &s;et out from the &s;hip on the 16th, in the morning, with the de&s;ign of going into the country as far as they could that day, and returning in the evening. Having entered a wood, they a&s;cended the hill through a pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s till the afternoon. After they had reached what they had taken for a plain, they
<PB N="190" REF="200">
were greatly di&s;appointed in finding it a &s;wamp, covered with birch, the bu&s;hes interwoven, and &s;o inflexible they could not be divided; how|ever, as they were not above three feet high, they &s;tept over them; but they were up to the an|cles in the boggy ground. The morning had been very fine, but the weather now became cold and di&s;agreeable; the bla&s;ts of wind were very piercing, and a &s;hower of &s;now fell. They neverthele&s;s pur&s;ued their route, in expectation of finding a better road. Before they had got over this &s;wamp, an accident happened that greatly di&s;concerted them; Mr. Buchan, one of the draught&s;men Mr. Banks had brought out, fell into a fit. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top and kindle a fire, and &s;uch as were mo&s;t fatigued remained to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; but Me&s;&s;rs. Banks, Solander, Green and Monkhou&s;e, pro|ceeded and attained the &s;pot they had in view. Here they found a great variety of plants, that gratified their curio&s;ity, and repaid them for their toil.</P>
<P>Upon returning to the re&s;t of the company, amid&s;t the &s;now which fell in greater abundance, and being pinched with the cold that was now become more inten&s;e, they found Mr. Buchan much recovered. They had previou&s;ly &s;ent Mr. Monkhou&s;e and Mr. Green back to Mr. Buchan, and tho&s;e who remained with him, in order to bring them to a hill, which was con|jectured to lie in a better track for returning
<PB N="191" REF="201">
to the wood, and was accordingly fixed on as a place of rendezvous. They re&s;olved from this hill to pa&s;s through the &s;wamp, which this way did not appear to be more than half a mile in extent, into the covert of the wood, in which they propo&s;ed building a hut and kindling a fire, to defend them from the &s;everity of the weather. The whole party accordingly met at the place appointed about eight in the evening, whil&s;t it was &s;till day-light, and proceeded to|wards the next valley. Dr. Solander having often pa&s;&s;ed mountains in cold countries, was &s;en|&s;ible that extreme cold, when joined with fa|tigue, occa&s;ions a drow&s;ine&s;s, that is not ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;ted; he accordingly intreated his friends to keep in motion, however di&s;agreeable it might be to them; his words were, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Whoever &s;its down, will &s;leep; and whoever &s;leeps, will wake no more."</Q> Every one &s;eemed accord|ingly armed with re&s;olution; but on a &s;udden the cold became &s;o very inten&s;e, as to threaten the mo&s;t direful effects. It was very remarka|ble, that Dr. Solander him&s;elf, who had &s;o for|cibly admoni&s;hed and alarmed his party, &s;hould be the fir&s;t who in&s;i&s;ted upon being &s;uffered to repo&s;e. In &s;pite of the mo&s;t earne&s;t intreaties of his friends, he lay down amid&s;t the &s;now, and it was with great difficulty they kept the Doctor awake. One of the black &s;ervants be|came al&s;o weary and faint, and was upon the point of following the Doctor's example. Mr.
<PB N="192" REF="202">
Buchan was therefore detached with a party to make a fire at the fir&s;t commodious &s;pot they could meet with. Mr. Banks, with four more, remained with the Doctor and Richmond the black, who, with the utmo&s;t difficulty, were induced to come on; but when they had tra|ver&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the &s;wamp, they expre&s;&s;ed their inability of going any farther. When the black was informed, that if he re|mained there he would &s;oon be frozen to death; he replied, that he was &s;o exhau&s;ted with fa|tigue, that death would be a relief to him. Doctor Solander &s;aid he was not unwilling to go, but that he mu&s;t fir&s;t take &s;ome &s;leep, not|with&s;tanding what he had before declared to the company. Thus re&s;olved, they both &s;at down, &s;upported by bu&s;hes, and in a &s;hort time fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. Intelligence now came from the advanced party, that a fire was kindled about a quarter of a mile farther on the way. Mr. Banks then waked the Doctor, who had almo&s;t lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs already, though it was but a few minutes &s;ince he &s;at down; he never|thele&s;s con&s;ented to go on. Every mea&s;ure ta|ken to relieve the black proved ineffectual, he remained motionle&s;s, and they were obliged to leave him to the care of the other black &s;ervant and a &s;ailor, who appeared to have been the lea&s;t hurt by the cold, and they were to be re|lieved, as &s;oon as two others were &s;ufficiently warmed to &s;upply their places. The Doctor
<PB N="193" REF="203">
was with much difficulty got to the fire. Tho&s;e who were &s;ent to relieve the companions of Richmond, returned in about half an hour, without being able to find them. What ren|dered the mortification &s;till greater was, that a bottle of rum, the whole &s;tock of the party, could not be found, and was judged to have been left to one of the three who were mi&s;&s;ing. There was a fall of &s;now, which ince&s;&s;antly continued for near two hours, and there remained no hopes of &s;eeing the three ab&s;entees again, at lea&s;t, alive. About 12 o'clock, however, a great &s;houting was heard at a di&s;tance, which gave inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to every one pre|&s;ent. Mr. Banks and four others went forth and met the &s;ailor, with ju&s;t &s;trength enough to walk; he was immediately &s;ent to the fire, and they proceeded to &s;eek for the two others. They found Richmond upon his legs, but in|capable of moving them; the other black was lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the ground. All endea|vours to bring them to the fire were fruitle&s;s, nor was it po&s;&s;ible to kindle one upon the &s;pot, on account of the &s;now that had fallen, and was &s;till falling, &s;o that there was no alternative, and they were compelled to leave the two un|fortunate negroes to their fate, making them, however, a bed of boughs of trees, and cover|ing them very thick with the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As all hands had been employed in endea|vouring to move the two blacks to the fire, and
<PB N="194" REF="204">
had therefore been expo&s;ed to the cold for near an hour and a half, &s;ome of them began to be afflicted in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e they went to relieve. Bri&s;coe, another of Mr. Banks's &s;ervants, in particular, began to lo&s;e his &s;en&s;ibi|lity. They at length reached the fire, and pa&s;&s;ed the night in a very di&s;agreeable manner. The party that &s;et out from the &s;hip con&s;i&s;ted of twelve, of whom two were already judged to be dead: it was doubtful whether a third would be able to return on board; and Mr. Buchan, a fourth, &s;eemed threatened again with his fits. The &s;hip was at the di&s;tance of a long day's journey, through an unfrequented wood, in which they might probably be bewildered till night; and being equipped only for a journey of a few hours, they had not provi&s;ions left &s;ufficient to afford the company a &s;ingle meal.</P>
<P>On the 17th in the morning, at day-break, nothing pre&s;ented it&s;elf to view all around but &s;now, the trees being equally covered with it as the ground; and the bla&s;ts of wind were &s;o violent and frequent, that their journey was rendered impracticable, and there was much rea|&s;on to dread peri&s;hing with cold and famine. However, about &s;ix in the morning they were flattered with a dawn of hope of being deliver|ed, by di&s;covering the &s;un through the clouds, which gradually dimini&s;hed. Previous to their &s;etting out, me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched to the
<PB N="195" REF="205">
unhappy negroes, who returned with the me|lancholy news of their death.</P>
<P>Though the &s;ky had flattered their hopes, the &s;now &s;till continued falling very fa&s;t, which prevented them beginning their journey &s;o &s;oon as was propo&s;ed; but a breeze &s;pringing up about 8 o'clock, added to the influence of the &s;un, began to clear the air; and the &s;now fall|ing in large flakes from the trees, announced a thaw. The force of hunger prevailed over every other con&s;ideration, and induced them, after having equally divided the &s;mall remains of their provi&s;ions, to &s;et forward on their journey about 10 in the morning.</P>
<P>In about three hours, to their great a&s;toni&s;h|ment and &s;atisfaction, they found them&s;elves upon the &s;hore, much nearer to the &s;hip than their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations could have flat|tered them. When they took a retro&s;pect of their former route from the &s;ea, they found, that in&s;tead of a&s;cending the hill in a direct line, they had made a circle almo&s;t round the country. The congratulations every one on board expre&s;&s;ed at their return, can better be imagined than expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 20th Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again on &s;hore, and landed in the bottom of the bay, when they collected many &s;hells and plants hitherto unknown. They returned on board to dinner, and afterwards went to vi|&s;it an Indian town about two miles up the coun|try.
<PB N="196" REF="206">
The acce&s;s was difficult on account of the mud. When they approached the town, two of the Indians came out to meet them: they began to &s;hout in the &s;ame unmeaning manner as they had before done on board the &s;hip. After this had continued for &s;ome time, they conducted Mr. Banks and the Doctor to the town. It was &s;eated on a &s;mall hill, over-&s;haded with wood, and con&s;i&s;ted of about a dozen huts; con&s;tructed without art or regularity. They were compo&s;|ed of a few poles inclining towards each other, in the &s;hape of a &s;ugar-loaf, which were cover|ed on the weather-&s;ide with gra&s;s and boughs; and on the other &s;ide a &s;pace was left open, which &s;erved at once for a fire-place and a door. The huts that had been &s;een in St. Vincent's Bay were of the &s;ame kind. A little gra&s;s &s;erved for beds and chairs, and their uten&s;ils con&s;i&s;ted of a ba&s;ket for the hand, a &s;atchel to hang upon the back, and a bladder for water; out of which they drank through a hole near the top. This town was inhabited by a &s;mall tribe, con&s;i&s;ting of about 50 men, women and chil|dren. Their bows and arrows were con&s;truct|ed with neatne&s;s and ingenuity: they were made of wood highly poli&s;hed; and the point, which was either gla&s;s or flint, was fitted with much &s;kill. Mr. Banks ob&s;erved gla&s;s and flint among&s;t them unwrought, with cloth, canva&s;s, rings and buttons, &amp;c. it was therefore judged, that they travelled at times to the north, as no &s;hip

had touched at this part of Terra del Fuego for &s;ome years.</P>
<P>Neither did they te&s;tify any &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;ight of fire-arms, and appeared to be well ac|quainted with their u&s;e. Probably the &s;pot on which Mr. Banks and the Doctor met them, was not a fixed habitation; their hou&s;es not being erected to &s;tand any length of time, and they were de&s;titute of a boat or canoe. They did not &s;eem to have any form of government a|mong them, nor did there appear any kind of &s;ubordination. The&s;e people appeared upon the whole to be the out-ca&s;ts of human nature, who&s;e lives were pa&s;&s;ed in wandering in a forlorn manner over dreary wa&s;tes&mdash;who&s;e only dwelling was a wretched hovel, &s;uch as has been de|&s;cribed, and their cloaths &s;carcely &s;ufficient to prevent their peri&s;hing with cold in the &s;ummer of this country, much le&s;s in the extreme &s;eve|rity of winter; their only food was &s;hell-fi&s;h, which mu&s;t &s;oon be exhau&s;ted at any one &s;pot; de&s;titute of every convenience ari&s;ing from the rude&s;t art, or even an implement to dre&s;s their food. Such were the&s;e people, who neverthele&s;s appeared content; &s;o little does refinement or luxury promote happine&s;s.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erved no quadruped animals except &s;eals, &s;ea-lions and dogs. Mr. Banks &s;aw, from a hill, the impre&s;&s;ion of the foot-&s;teps of a large bea&s;t on the &s;urface of a bog, but he could not determine of what kind it was. This gentle|man
<PB N="198" REF="209">
ob&s;erved no land-birds larger than an Eng|li&s;h black-bird, except hawks and vultures; there were however ducks, and other water fowl in abundance; likewi&s;e &s;hell-fi&s;h, mu&s;cles, clams and limpets in great plenty.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that in this country, though uncleared, there was no &s;pecies of hurtful or trouble&s;ome animals. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found a great variety of plants. The beach and the birch may be u&s;ed for timber. The &s;curvy-gra&s;s and wild celery, it is imagin|ed, contain anti&s;corbutic qualities; and may therefore be of &s;ervice to the crews of &s;uch &s;hips as hereafter touch at this place. The for|mer is found in abundance near &s;prings and in damp places, particularly at the watering-place in the Bay of Good Succe&s;s, and re&s;em|bles the cuckow-flower or lady's-&s;mock in Eng|land. The wild-celery re&s;embles the celery in our gardens, but the leaves are of a deeper green. It grows in great plenty near the beach, and upon the land above the &s;pring-tides; and ta&s;tes like par&s;ley mixed with celery. In the morning of Sunday, January 22, Captain Cook having got in his wood and water, &s;ailed out of the bay, and &s;teered his cour&s;e through the &s;treight.</P>
<P>The generality of writers, who have de&s;cribed the i&s;land of Terra del Fuego, have repre&s;ent|ed it as covered with &s;now, and de&s;titute of wood. In this however they are evidently mi&s;|taken,
<PB N="199" REF="210">
and their error mu&s;t have ari&s;en from having vi&s;ited it in the winter &s;ea&s;on, when it po&s;&s;ibly is covered with &s;now. The crew of the Endeavour perceived trees when they were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the i&s;land, and on their nearer approach, they found the &s;ea coa&s;t and the &s;ides of the hills clothed with an agreeable verdure. The &s;ummit of the hills are barren, but the vallies are rich, and a brook is to be found at the foot of almo&s;t every hill; the water has a reddi&s;h tinge, but is not ill ta&s;t|ed, and was &s;ome of the be&s;t Captain Cook took in during his whole voyage.</P>
<P>The &s;treight of Le Maire is bounded on the we&s;t by Terra del Fuego, and on the ea&s;t by the we&s;t end of Staten Land, and is near five leagues in length, and as many in breadth. The bay of Good Succe&s;s is &s;eated about the middle of it on the &s;ide of Terra del Fuego, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf upon entering the &s;treight from the northward; and the &s;outh head of it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a land-mark, re&s;embling a road from the &s;ea to the country. It affords good anchorage, and plenty of wood and water. Staten Land did not appear to Captain Cook in the manner de&s;cribed in Lord An&s;on's Voyage; the horror and wildne&s;s with which it is there depicted was not di&s;cernable to Mr. Banks and the other gentlemen; on the con|trary, the land was neither de&s;titute of wood nor verdure, nor covered with &s;now, and on
<PB N="200" REF="211">
the north &s;ide there appeared bays and harbours. This difference may al&s;o probably ari&s;e from their not having vi&s;ited the place in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day, January 26, Capt. Cook &s;ailed from Cape Horn. The farthe&s;t &s;outhern lati|tude he made was 60 degrees 10 minutes, by 74 degrees 30 minutes we&s;t. The weather being very calm, Mr. Banks &s;ailed in a &s;mall boat to &s;hoot birds, when he killed &s;ome &s;heer-waters and albatro&s;&s;es; the latter were larger than tho&s;e caught to the north of the &s;treight; the &s;heer-waters were le&s;s, and their backs darker coloured. The albatro&s;&s;es proved very good eating.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the doubling of Cape Horn is repre&s;ented as a very dangerous cour&s;e, and that it is generally thought pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treight of Magellan is le&s;s perilous, the En|deavour doubled it with as little danger as the North Foreland on the Kenti&s;h coa&s;t; the hea|vens were fair, the wind temperate, the wea|ther plea&s;ant, and, being near &s;hore, they had a very di&s;tinct view of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, March 1, Captain Cook was in latitude 38 degrees 44 minutes &s;outh, and lon|gitude 110 degrees 33 minutes we&s;t, as well by ob&s;ervation as by the log; which concurrence, after a cour&s;e of 660 leagues, was judged very &s;ingular; from whence it was plain, he had no currents that affected the &s;hip, and mo&s;t proba|bly
<PB N="201" REF="212">
had not approached any land of great ex|tent, as there are always currents near lands of con|&s;iderable compa&s;s. Mr. Banks killed more than &s;ixty birds in one day, and he caught two fore&s;t flies of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but never yet de&s;crib|ed: he al&s;o found a cuttle fi&s;h, which had ju&s;t been killed by the birds; it was different from the fi&s;hes of this name, met with in the European &s;eas, having a double row of &s;harp talons, re|&s;embling tho&s;e of a cat, which i&s;&s;ued or retracted at will. This fi&s;h made excellent &s;oup.</P>
<P>Saturday, the 25th, on account of a &s;quabble about a bit of &s;eal-&s;kin, which he had taken in a frolic, but which was repre&s;ented to his officer as a theft, one of the marines, a young fellow about twenty, threw him&s;elf overboard, and was drowned.</P>
<P>About 10 o'clock, Tue&s;day, April 4, Peter Bri&s;coe, &s;ervant to Mr. Banks, di&s;covered land to the &s;outh, about three or four leagues di&s;|tant. The Captain immediately hauled up for it, and found it to be an i&s;land of an oval form, with a lake or lagoon in the center, that ex|tended over the greate&s;t part of it; the border of land which &s;urrounded the lake was in many places low and narrow, e&s;pecially towards the &s;outh, where the beach con&s;i&s;ted of a reef of rocks; three places on the north &s;ide had the &s;ame appearance. This di&s;membrance of the firm land, made the whole re&s;emble &s;everal woody i&s;lands. To the we&s;t was a large clump of trees, and in the center two cocoa-nut trees.
<PB N="202" REF="213">
Captain Cook came within a mile on the north &s;ide, but though he ca&s;t a line of 130 fathom, he found no bottom, and could not meet with any anchorage. The i&s;land appeared covered with trees of different &s;orts, but the gentlemen on board could not a&s;certain any, with gla&s;&s;es, except palm-nuts and cocoa-nuts; there were &s;everal natives vi&s;ible on &s;hore; they &s;eemed tall, with remarkable large heads, which might probably be increa&s;ed by &s;ome bandage; their hair was black, and their complexions copper colour. There appeared along the beach, a|brea&s;t of the &s;hip, &s;ome of the&s;e inhabitants, with pikes or poles in their hands, which &s;eemed twice the height of them&s;elves: they at this time appeared naked; but when they retired, upon the &s;hip's pa&s;&s;ing the i&s;land, they put on a covering of a light colour. Some clumps of palm-trees &s;erved them for habitations, and at a di&s;tance re&s;embled hilly ground, and the groves had a very happy effect. This i&s;land was in la|titude 18 degrees &s;outh longitude, 139 28 we&s;t, and was named LAGOON ISLAND.</P>
<P>Captain Cook &s;aw land again in the afternoon to the north-we&s;t. He reached it by &s;un-&s;et, when it appeared a low i&s;land covered with wood, in form circular, about a mile in circum|ference. No inhabitants were vi&s;ible, nor any cocoa-nut trees; though the Endeavour had reached the &s;hore within half a mile, yet the &s;land appeared covered with verdure of various tinges. This i&s;land, which is di&s;tant from that
<PB N="203" REF="214">
of Lagoon, about &s;even leagues north 62 we&s;t. The gentlemen on board named THRUMB CAP.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 5th they continued their cour&s;e with a fine trade wind, and about three o'clock di&s;covered land to the we&s;t. This was a low i&s;land between 10 and 12 leagues in circum|ference; it re&s;embled in form a bow, the cord and arch forming the land, and the inter&s;tice marking the water; the beach was flat, with|out any vi&s;ible herbage upon it, being covered with &s;ea-weeds. Its length was between three and four leagues, and its width about 200 yards; the bow terminated with two large tufts of co|coa-nut trees; the arch was covered with trees of various heights, and of different verdure; &s;ome parts of it, however, was low, and re|&s;embled the cord. They &s;ailed along the beach, within a league, till &s;un-&s;et, when they judged they were half way between the two tufts of trees; here they &s;ounded. This i&s;land, from the &s;moke that was di&s;covered, appeared to be inhabited, and it was named BOW ISLAND. Captain Cook's &s;econd Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, &s;aid, after they had &s;ailed by the i&s;land, that he had perceived &s;everal of the natives under the fir&s;t clump of trees, that he had di&s;crimi|nated their hou&s;es, and ob&s;erved many canoes hauled up. But he was the only per&s;on who made the&s;e ob&s;ervations, though there were &s;e|veral upon deck be&s;ides him&s;elf.</P>
<P>About noon, on Thur&s;day the 6th, they &s;aw
<PB N="204" REF="215">
land again to the we&s;t, and at three o'clock they came up with it. This land &s;eemed divided into two i&s;lands, or rather collections of i&s;lands, their extent being near nine leagues. The two large&s;t were divided from each other by a &s;treight of near half a mile in breadth.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e i&s;lands were ten miles or more in length, but appeared like long narrow &s;trings of land, not above a quarter of a mile broad; they &s;eemed, however, to produce trees of different kinds, among which was the cocoa-nut tree. Several of the inhabitants came out in their canoes, and two of them appeared to have a de&s;ign of coming on board; but they, with the re&s;t, &s;topped at the reef. When Captain Cook had got about a league from the &s;hore, he perceived &s;ome of the natives following in a canoe, with a &s;ail: he did not think proper to wait for her, and though &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the reef, &s;he di&s;continued her cour&s;e. The&s;e peo|ple appeared to be about our &s;ize, and well made: their complexion was brown, and they &s;eemed naked; they had, for the mo&s;t part, two weapons in their hands; one was a thin long pole, with a kind of &s;pear at the end; the other re&s;embled a paddle; &s;ome of their canoes were con&s;tructed to carry not more than three men; others had on board &s;ix or &s;even; one hoi&s;ted a &s;ail, which, upon the falling of a &s;hower of rain, was taken down and converted into an awning. It could not be determined
<PB N="205" REF="216">
whether the &s;ignals made by the people on &s;hore were de&s;igned to deter the Endeavour's com|pany from landing, or as an invitation to come on &s;hore; the&s;e waved their hats, the others an&s;wered by &s;houting. The Captain did not judge it prudent or merciful to be convinced in this re&s;pect, as the i&s;land appeared of no im|portance, and the crew were not de&s;titute of any thing it could produce; and as it mu&s;t have proved a bloody conte&s;t on the &s;ide of the un|armed Indians. This curio&s;ity was therefore laid a&s;ide, in expectation of &s;oon di&s;covering the i&s;land, where they had been directed to make their a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations, the natives of which, it is rea&s;onable to conjecture, would make no oppo&s;ition to the landing of the gen|tlemen on board, having already experienced the danger of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Captain Cook di&s;covered another i&s;land on the &s;eventh, about &s;ix in the morning, which was judged to be in compa&s;s about five miles. It was very low, with a piece of water in the center, and appeared to abound in wood, and to be co|vered with verdure, but no inhabitants were vi&s;ible. It was called BIRD ISLAND, from the number of birds that were flying about.</P>
<P>Saturday 8, in the afternoon, they &s;aw land to the north, and in the evening came a-brea&s;t of it, at about five miles di&s;tance. This land &s;eemed to be a chain of low i&s;lands, it was of an oval figure, and con&s;i&s;ted of coral and &s;and,
<PB N="206" REF="217">
with a few clumps of &s;mall trees, and in the middle of it was a lagoon. It was, from its ap|pearance, called CHAIN ISLAND. They &s;aw &s;moke, which aro&s;e from different parts, by which they were convinced it was inhabited.</P>
<P>On Monday the 10th, after a tempe&s;tuous night, Captain Cook &s;aw O&s;naburgh I&s;land; it is called by the natives Maite. This i&s;land is high and circular, about four miles in circum|ference: it is partly naked and rocky, and partly covered with trees.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, upon their looking out for the i&s;land to which they were de&s;tined, they &s;aw land a-head. The next morning it appeared very high and mountainous, and it was known to be King George the IIId's I&s;land, &s;o named by Captain Wallis, but by the natives called Otaheite. The calms prevented the Endeavour from approaching it till the morning of the 12th, when a breeze &s;pringing up, before 11 &s;everal canoes were making towards the &s;hip; only a few approached, and the people on board tho&s;e that came the neare&s;t would not come on board Captain Cook. Each canoe had in it young plantains, and branches of trees. They were brought, as Captain Cook was afterwards informed, as tokens of peace and friend&s;hip, and they were handed up the &s;ides of the &s;hip by the people in one of the canoes, who made &s;ig|nals in a very expre&s;&s;ive manner, intimating, that they de&s;ired the&s;e emblems of pacification
<PB N="207" REF="218">
&s;hould be placed in a con&s;picuous part of the &s;hip; and they were accordingly &s;tuck among&s;t the rigging, at which they te&s;tified their appro|bation. Their cargoes con&s;i&s;ting of cocoa-nuts, bananas, bread-fruit, apples and figs, which were very acceptable to the crew, and were then purcha&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the evening they opened the north-we&s;t point, and &s;aw York I&s;land, &s;o named by the crew of the Dolphin. They lay off and on all night, and in the morning of the 13th they en|tered Port Royal Harbour, in the i&s;land of Otaheite, and anchored within half a mile of the &s;hore. A great number of the natives im|mediately came off in their canoes, bringing with them bananas, cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, apples, and &s;ome hogs, which they bartered with the &s;hip's crew for beads and other trinkets.</P>
<P>The tree that bears the bread-fruit is about the &s;ize of the hor&s;e-che&s;nut; its leaves are near a foot and a half long, in &s;hape oblong, re&s;embling, in almo&s;t every re&s;pect, tho&s;e of the fig-tree; its fruit is not unlike the cantaloupe melon, either in &s;ize or &s;hape; it is inclo&s;ed in a thin &s;kin, and its core is as large as a per&s;on's thumb; it is &s;omewhat of the con&s;i&s;tency of new bread, and as white as the blanched almon: it divides into parts, and they roa&s;t it before it is eaten; it has little or no ta&s;te. An elderly man, named <HI>Owhaw,</HI> who was known to Mr. Gore and others, who had vi&s;ited this i&s;land with Captain Wallis, came on
<PB N="208" REF="219">
board, and as he was con&s;idered a u&s;eful man, the Captain endeavoured to gratify all his en|quiries. Captain Cook now drew up &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary rules for the regulation of their traffic with the inhabitants, and ordered that they &s;hould be punctually ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip was properly &s;ecured, the Captain went on &s;hore with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, a party under arms, and their friend the old Indian. They were received on &s;hore by &s;ome hundreds of the natives, who were &s;truck with &s;uch awe, that the fir&s;t who ap|proached crept almo&s;t upon his hands and knees. He al&s;o pre&s;ented to them branches of trees, the u&s;ual &s;ymbol of peace. This &s;ymbol was received, on the part of the Engli&s;h gen|tlemen, with demon&s;trations of &s;atisfaction and friend&s;hip; and noticing, that while each of the Indians held one of the&s;e branches in his hand, they gathered &s;ome, and followed the example of the natives.</P>
<P>They were conducted by the old Indian, accompanied by his countrymen, towards the place where the Dolphin had watered; here the ground being cleared, the chiefs of the natives threw down their boughs, and the Captain and his companions followed the example, after hav|ing drawn up the marines, who, marching in order, dropped their branches upon tho&s;e of the Indians. When they came to the watering-place, the Indians intimated, that they had
<PB N="209" REF="220">
their permi&s;&s;ion to occupy that ground, but it was not &s;uited to their purpo&s;e. In the cour&s;e of this walk, and a circuit through the woods, the Indians had got rid of their timidity, and became familiarized. On the way they receiv|ed beads and other &s;mall pre&s;ents, at which they expre&s;&s;ed great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The whole circuit was near four miles, thro' groves, con&s;i&s;ting of trees of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit. Beneath which trees were the ha|bitations of the natives, con&s;i&s;ting of only a roof, de&s;titute of walls. In this peregrination the gentlemen were not a little di&s;appointed at finding very few fowls or hogs. Captain Cook was informed by &s;uch of the party as had been here with the Dolphin, that none of the people hitherto &s;een were of the fir&s;t rank, and they imagined the Queen's re&s;idence was moved, no traces remaining of it. Next morning, be|fore they left the &s;hip, &s;everal canoes came a|bout her, filled with people, who&s;e dre&s;s de|noted them of the &s;uperior cla&s;s: two of the&s;e came on board, and each of them fixed upon a friend; one of them cho&s;e Mr. Banks, and the other Captain Cook. The ceremony con|&s;i&s;ted of taking off their cloaths in great part, and putting them upon their adopted friends. This compliment was returned, by pre&s;enting them &s;ome trinkets. They then made &s;igns for the&s;e gentlemen to go with them to the place of their abode; and the Captain being de&s;irous
<PB N="210" REF="221">
of meeting with a more convenient harbour, and knowing more of the people, readily a&s;&s;ent|ed. Accordingly the Captain, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, with the Indians and other friends, got into two boats. About three miles di&s;tance they landed, among &s;everal hundreds of the na|tives, who conducted them to a large hou&s;e. Upon their entrance they &s;aw a middle aged man, named <HI>Tootahah,</HI> who, as &s;oon as they were &s;eated, ordered a cock and hen to be pro|duced, which he pre&s;ented to Mr. Banks and the Captain, as well as a piece of perfumed cloth; which compliment was returned by a pre&s;ent from Mr. Banks. They were then con|ducted with great civility to &s;everal large hou&s;es, con&s;tructed in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e already de&s;cribed; the ladies, &s;o far from &s;hunning, in|vited, and even pre&s;&s;ed them to be &s;eated. Whil&s;t they were afterwards walking along the &s;hore, they met, accompanied by a great num|ber of natives, another Chief, named <HI>Tubora Tumaida,</HI> with whom they &s;ettled a treaty of peace, in the manner before de&s;cribed. Tu|bora Tumaida intimated, he had provi&s;ions for them if they cho&s;e to eat, and they according|ly dined heartily upon bread-fruit, plantains and fi&s;h.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this vi&s;it, Tomio, the wife of the Chief, placed her&s;elf upon the &s;ame matt with Mr. Banks, clo&s;e by him, but &s;he not be|ing young, nor appearing ever to have po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="211" REF="222">
many charms; to the&s;e cau&s;es may be a&s;crib|ed the little attention this gentleman paid her; and Tomio received the additional mortification of Mr. Banks's beckoning to a pretty girl, who, with &s;ome reluctance, came and &s;eated her&s;elf by him. The Prince&s;s was &s;omewhat mortified at the preference given to her rival, neverthele&s;s &s;he continued her a&s;&s;iduities to him. This whim&s;ical &s;cene was interrupted by an event of a &s;erious nature. Dr. Solander hav|ing di&s;covered that he had lo&s;t an opera gla&s;s, they complained to the Chief, and interrupted the convivial party. This complaint was en|forced, by Mr. Banks's &s;tarting up and &s;triking the butt end of his mu&s;ket on the ground, which &s;truck the Indians with a panic, and they all precipitately ran out of the hou&s;e, except the Chief, and a few others of the &s;uperior cla&s;s.</P>
<P>The Chief appeared much concerned at this accident; not, as we had rea&s;on afterwards to believe, that he had any aver&s;ion to knavi&s;h practices, but becau&s;e he feared that this early in&s;tance of di&s;hone&s;ty might give us unfavour|able &s;u&s;picions of his countrymen, and thereby deprive him of tho&s;e advantages and emolu|ments which they expected to gain from us, and which by various artifices they afterwards &s;ecured, when our connexion with them be|came more intimate. The chief, therefore, to obviate any di&s;advantageous impre&s;&s;ions, gave us to under&s;tand, with an appearance of great
<PB N="212" REF="223">
probity, that the place which the Doctor had mentioned was not within his di&s;trict, but that he would &s;end to the Chief of it, and endea|vour if po&s;&s;ible to have the gla&s;s recovered; but that if this could not be done, he would make the Doctor compen&s;ation, by giving him as much new cloth, of which he &s;hewed large quantities, as &s;hould be thought equal to its va|lue. The ca&s;e however was in a little time brought, and the gla&s;s it&s;elf &s;oon after, which deprived us of the merit we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have had in refu&s;ing the cloth which had been offered us. But it afforded an opportunity of convincing the natives of our genero&s;ity, by lavi&s;hing rewards on them for an action, to which &s;elf-intere&s;t had been the motive, rather than any &s;entiment of probity; to which, from numerous tran&s;actions, they appeared to be ab|&s;olute &s;trangers. After this adventure was ami|cably terminated, they returned to the &s;hip about &s;ix o'clock in the evening.</P>
<P>Saturday the 15th in the morning, &s;everal of the Chiefs, one of whom was very corpulent, came on board from the other point, bringing with them hogs, bread-fruit, and other refre&s;h|ments, in exchange for which they gave them hatchets, linen, beads and other trinkets, but &s;ome of them took the liberty of &s;tealing the top of the lightening chain. This day the Captain, attended by Mr. Banks and &s;ome of the other gentlemen, went a-&s;hore to fix on a
<PB N="213" REF="224">
proper &s;pot to erect a &s;mall fort for their defence during their &s;tay on the i&s;land; and the ground was accordingly marked out for that purpo&s;e. A great number of the natives looking on all the while, and behaving in the mo&s;t peaceable and friendly manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks having &s;u&s;pected, from &s;eeing few hogs or poultry in their walks, that they had, upon the &s;hip's arrival, been driven farther up the country, it was re&s;olved to penetrate into the woods; &s;ome marines and a petty officer being appointed to guard the tent in the inte|rim; &s;everal of the natives accompanied the gentlemen in this excur&s;ion. Upon cro&s;&s;ing a little river Mr. Banks perceiving &s;ome ducks, fired, and killed three. The Indians were &s;truck with the utmo&s;t terror at this event, which oc|ca&s;ioned them to fall &s;uddenly to the ground, as if they had been &s;hot at the &s;ame time; they recovered, however, pre&s;ently from their fright, and continued the march. Before this party had gone much farther, they were alarmed by the di&s;charge of two pieces, fired by the tent-guard. Owhaw, after calling together the Cap|tain's party, di&s;per&s;ed all the Indians except three, who broke branches of trees as pledges of their fidelity. Upon their return to the tent, it appeared, that an Indian had taken an op|portunity to &s;natch away one of the centinels mu&s;quets; whereupon a young mid&s;hipman, under who&s;e command the party was, very im|prudently
<PB N="214" REF="225">
ordered the marines to fire, which they did immediately among&s;t the thicke&s;t of the fugitive Indians, in number above a hun|dred, &s;everal of whom were wounded, but as the criminal did not fall, they pur&s;ued and &s;hot him dead.</P>
<P>When Mr. Banks heard of the affair, he was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with the guard, and he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to accommodate the dif|ference; going acro&s;s the river, and through the mediation of an old man, prevailed on many of the natives to come over to them, bringing plantain-trees, their u&s;ual &s;ignal of peace, and clapping their hands in their brea&s;ts, they cried, <HI>Tyau,</HI> which &s;ignifies friend&s;hip. In a &s;hort time they became &s;ocial and chearful, and &s;eem|ed, for the pre&s;ent, to have buried in oblivion the wanton acts of cruelty which had been &s;o lately exerci&s;ed on their fellow countrymen.</P>
<P>Few of the natives appeared next morning upon the beach, and not one of them came on board. From hence Mr. Banks and the other gentlemen concluded, that their apprehen&s;ions were not intirely removed, more e&s;pecially as even Owhaw had for&s;aken them. The Cap|tain, in con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;agreeable ap|pearances, brought the &s;hip nearer to &s;hore, and moored her &s;o as to make her broad &s;ide bear on the &s;pot which had been marked for erecting the fort. The Captain went on &s;hore in the evening, with &s;ome of the gentlemen,
<PB N="215" REF="226">
when the Indians a&s;&s;embled round them, and they trafficked together in a friendly manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks had the misfortune of lo&s;ing Mr. Buchan on the 17th.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day they received on board a vi&s;it from Tubora Tumaida and Tootahah. As tokens of peace, they brought with them &s;ome plantain branches, and would not ri&s;k them|&s;elves on board till the&s;e had been received, be|ing probably alarmed at the affair of the tent. They al&s;o brought &s;ome bread-fruit and a hog ready dre&s;&s;ed: in return for which they receiv|ed &s;ome nails.</P>
<P>The fort began to be erected on the 18th. Some of the company were employed in throw|ing up intrenchments, whil&s;t others were occu|pied in cutting fa&s;cines and pickets, which the Indians of their own accord chearfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted in bringing from the woods. Three &s;ides of the fort were fortified with intrenchments and palli|&s;ades; and on the other which was flanked by a river, the water-ca&s;ks being filled, were placed &s;o as to form a brea&s;t-work.</P>
<P>This day the natives brought down &s;uch quantities of bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to reject them, and to intimate to them, that the company would not want any for two days. Beads were trafficked this day for every thing. Mr. Banks's tent being got up, he, for the fir&s;t time, &s;lept on &s;hore. No In|dian attempted to approach it the whole night;

however, a precaution had been taken to place proper centinels about it.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 19, Tubora Tumaida vi&s;ited Mr. Banks at his tent, and brought with him, be&s;ides his wife and family, the materials for erecting a hou&s;e, in the neighbourhood of the fort, where he de&s;igned to re&s;ide: &s;ome time after he had reached the tent, he reque&s;ted Mr. Banks to accompany him back to the woods; on their arrival at a place where he occa&s;ionally re&s;ided, he pre&s;ented him with two garments, one of which was of red cloth, and the other of very fine matting; in which, having clothed Mr. Banks, he conducted him to the &s;hip, and with his wife and &s;on &s;taid to dinner: they had a di&s;h &s;erved up, which was prepared by one of Tubora Tumaida's attendants, not unlike in ta&s;te to what in England is called flummery; of this di&s;h the natives &s;eemed exceedingly fond, but the Engli&s;h could not reli&s;h it. Tu|bora Tumaida had likewi&s;e brought with him &s;ome food, which appeared like the flower of wheat; this being mixed with cocoa-nut liquor, and &s;ome hot &s;tones put into it, was &s;tirred a|bout till it became a thick jelly; on ta&s;ting it, they found it of an agreeable flavour, not very inferior to good blanc mange.</P>
<P>Without the lines a &s;ort of market was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, which was tolerably well &s;upplied. Tubora Tumaida became Mr. Banks's and the other gentlemens frequent gue&s;t; he adopted
<PB N="217" REF="228">
their manners, and was the only one of his countrymen who had attempted to u&s;e a knife and fork.</P>
<P>Mr. Monkhou&s;e, the Surgeon, &s;aid he had &s;een, in his evening walk the body of the man who had been &s;hot at the tent. It was depo|&s;ited in a &s;hed, clo&s;e to the hou&s;e where he had re&s;ided when alive, and others were within ten yards of it. It was in length about fifteen feet, and eleven in breadth, and the height was pro|portionable: the two &s;ides and one end were partly enclo&s;ed with a &s;ort of wicker-work, the other end was entirely open. The corps was depo&s;ited on a bier, the frame of which was wood, with a matted bottom, &s;upported by po&s;ts about five feet high. The corps was co|vered with a matt, and over that a white cloth; by its &s;ide lay a wooden mace, and towards the head two cocoa-nut &s;hells: towards the feet was a bunch of green leaves, and &s;mall dried boughs, tied together and &s;tuck in the ground, near which was a &s;tone the &s;ize of a cocoa-nut: here was al&s;o placed a young plantain-tree and a &s;tone axe. A great number of palm-nuts were hung in &s;trings at the open end of the &s;hed; and the &s;tem of a plantain-tree was &s;tuck up without the &s;hed; upon this &s;tem was placed a cocoa|nut &s;hell filled with fre&s;h water. At the &s;ide of one of the po&s;ts, there hung a little bag with &s;ome roa&s;ted pieces of bread-fruit. The natives did not &s;eem plea&s;ed at his approaching
<PB N="218" REF="229">
the body, their jealou&s;y and unea&s;ine&s;s being very vi&s;ibly depicted in their countenances.</P>
<P>The flies on &s;hore were &s;o very tormenting, that they were obliged to de&s;troy them with mu&s;queto nets and fly traps.</P>
<P>They had a &s;pecimen of the mu&s;ic of the country on the 22d; &s;ome of the natives per|forming on flutes, which had only two &s;tops; they were blown like the German flute, but the performer blew with his no&s;tril in&s;tead of his mouth: &s;everal others &s;ung, only one tune, to this in&s;trument.</P>
<P>Some of the Indians brought the Engli&s;h axes to grind and repair, mo&s;t of which they had received from the Dolphin; but a French one occa&s;ioned much &s;peculation, and it at length appeared to have been left here by Mr. de Bougainville.</P>
<P>On the 24th Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander made an excur&s;ion into the country, which they found to be level and fertile for about two miles along the &s;hore to the ea&s;tward, after which the hills reached quite to the water's edge, and farther on they ran out into the &s;ea. Af|ter pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e hills, which continued about three miles, they di&s;covered a large plain, a|bounding with good hou&s;es, inhabited by peo|ple who &s;eemed to be in affluence. A very wide river i&s;&s;uing from a valley, added greatly to the beauty of this place: they cro&s;&s;ed this river, and perceived the country to be again

barren, which determined them to return; but ju&s;t as they had taken this re&s;olution, they were offered &s;ome refre&s;hment by one of the natives, a man, at &s;ome authors de&s;cribe to be, mixed with many nations, but different from them all, his &s;kin being of a dead white, though &s;ome parts of his body were not &s;o white as others; his hair, eye-brows, and beard were as white as his &s;kin. The great joy of Tubora Tu|maida and his women, who met them as they returned, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 25th &s;everal of their knives were mi&s;|&s;ing; upon which Mr. Banks, who had lo&s;t his among the re&s;t, accu&s;ed Tubora Tumaida with having &s;tolen it, which cau&s;ed him to be very unhappy, as he happened to be innocent of the fact, Mr. Banks's &s;ervant having mi&s;|laid it; and the re&s;t were produced in a rag by a native. The Indian was &s;ome time before he would forget this accu&s;ation, the tears &s;tarting from his eyes, and he made &s;igns with the knife, that if he had ever been guilty of &s;uch an ac|tion, as was imputed to him, he would &s;uffer his throat to be cut. However, in general, the&s;e people, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, are the greate&s;t thieves in the world.</P>
<P>On the 26th, &s;ix &s;wivel guns were mounted upon the fort, which put the natives into great con&s;ternation, and cau&s;ed &s;everal fi&s;hermen, who lived upon the point, to remove farther off, ima|gining they were to be fired at in a few days.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="232">The next day Tubora Tumaida, with a friend, a remarkable glutton, and three of his women, dined at the fort; after which he &s;et out for his hou&s;e in the wood. In a &s;hort time he returned in much agitation, to acquaint Mr. Banks, that the &s;hip's butcher had threatened to cut his wife's throat, upon her refu&s;ing to &s;ell him a &s;tone hatchet, which he had taken a fancy to, for a nail. It clearly appeared he had been culpable, and he was flogged on board, in &s;ight of &s;everal of the Indians. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;troke was given they interfered, and earne&s;tly intreated that he might be untied. This being refu&s;ed, they bur&s;t into tears, and &s;hewed great concern.</P>
<P>On Friday 28, one of Tubora Tumaida's female attendants, came down to the fort in the greate&s;t affliction, the tears gu&s;hing from her eyes, and full of lamentation. Mr. Banks &s;eeing her, in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the cau&s;e; but in&s;tead of an&s;wering, &s;he &s;truck her&s;elf &s;e|veral times with a &s;hark's tooth upon the head, till &s;he cau&s;ed a great effu&s;ion of blood; while her di&s;tre&s;s was unnoticed by &s;everal other In|dians, who continued laughing and talking with the utmo&s;t unconcern. After this, &s;he gather|ed up &s;ome pieces of cloth, which &s;he had thrown down to catch the blood, and threw them into the &s;ea, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to obliterate her ab&s;urd behaviour. She then bathed her&s;elf in the river, and with remarkable chearfulne&s;s
<PB N="221" REF="233">
returned to the tent, as if nothing extraordinary had happened.</P>
<P>During the forenoon of this day, canoes were continually coming in, and the tents at the fort were filled with people of both &s;exes. Mr. Mo|lineux, Ma&s;ter of the Endeavour, went on &s;hore, and &s;eeing a woman, who&s;e name was Oberea, he declared &s;he was the per&s;on he judg|ed to be the queen of the i&s;land, when he came there on board the Dolphin in the la&s;t voyage.</P>
<P>The eyes of every one were now fixed on her, who had made &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a figure, in the accounts that had been given by the fir&s;t di&s;co|verers of this i&s;land. The per&s;on of the queen Oberea was of a large make, and tall; &s;he was about forty years of age, her &s;kin white; her eyes had great expre&s;&s;ion and meaning in them; &s;he had been hand&s;ome, but her beauty was now upon the decline. She was &s;oon conduct|ed to the &s;hip, and went on board, accompa|nied with &s;ome of her family. Many pre&s;ents were made her, particularly a child's doll, which &s;eemed the mo&s;t to engro&s;s her attention. Cap|tain Cook accompanied her on &s;hore; and as &s;oon as they landed, &s;he pre&s;ented him with a hog, and &s;ome plantains, which were carried to the fort in proce&s;&s;ion, Oberea and the Captain bringing up the rear. They met Tootahah, who, though not King, &s;eemed to be at this time inve&s;ted with a &s;overeign authority. He immediately became jealous of the Queen's
<PB N="222" REF="234">
having the doll; which made them find it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to compliment him with one al&s;o. A doll now was preferable to a hatchet, though it was not con&s;idered &s;o long, as they &s;oon were looked upon as trifles of little or no value.</P>
<P>The &s;hip's provi&s;ions &s;eemed to be very ac|ceptable to the men, but the women were &s;hy of ta&s;ting any of them. They were &s;olicited &s;trongly, this day, to dine with the gentlemen; but they refu&s;ed, and cho&s;e to partake of plan|tains with the &s;ervants; a my&s;tery that could not be explained.</P>
<P>On Saturday 29, in the forenoon, Mr. Banks paid a vi&s;it to Oberea, who was &s;till a&s;leep un|der the awning of her canoe, whither he went with an intention of calling her up. Upon en|tering her chamber, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, he found her in bed with a hand&s;ome young fel|low, about five and twenty; upon which he immediately retired with &s;ome precipitation, not a little di&s;concerted at this di&s;covery; but he was &s;oon given to under&s;tand, that &s;uch amours were by no means con&s;idered &s;candalous, and that Obadie, the per&s;on found in bed with the queen, was by every one known to have been &s;elected by her as the object of her la&s;civious hours. The queen &s;oon got up and dre&s;&s;ed her|&s;elf to wait upon Mr. Banks. After dre&s;&s;ing him in a &s;uit of fine cloth, they proceed|ed together to the tents. Mr. Banks paid a vi&s;it in the evening to Tubora Tumaida, and
<PB N="223" REF="235">
was greatly &s;urprized to find him and his family all in tears; he in vain attempted to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, and &s;oon took leave of them. Upon his return he was told by the officers, that Owhaw had foretold that the guns would be fired in four days, and as this was the eve of the third day, they were alarmed at the &s;ituation they judged them&s;elves to be in. In con&s;e|quence of this intelligence they doubled the centries at the fort, and the gentlemen &s;lept under arms. Mr. Banks, about two in the morning, went round the point, but finding every thing as he could wi&s;h, he dropt all &s;u&s;|picions of the Indians having ho&s;tile intentions, and dwelt quite &s;ecure, as the little fortification was now complete.</P>
<P>The next day, Sunday the 30th, Tomio came running to the tents, and taking Mr. Banks by the arm, to whom they applied in all emergent ca&s;es, told him that Tubora Tu|maida was dying, owing to &s;omething which had been given him to eat by his people, and prayed him to go in&s;tantly to him. Accord|ingly Mr. Banks went, and found the Indian very &s;ick. He was told, that he had been vo|miting, and had thrown up a leaf, which they &s;aid contained &s;ome of the poi&s;on which he had taken. Upon examining the leaf, Mr. Banks found it to be nothing more than tobacco, which the Indian had begged of &s;ome of their people. He looked up to Mr. Banks, while
<PB N="224" REF="236">
he was examining the leaf, as if he had not a moment to live. Mr. Banks, now knowing his di&s;order, ordered him to drink of cocoa-nut milk, which &s;oon re&s;tored him to health, and he was as chearful as ever.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of May Captain Cook produced an iron adze, made in imitation of one of their &s;tone ones, which had been brought home by Captain Wallis, and &s;hewed it to Tootahah, who took &s;uch a fancy to it, that notwith&s;tanding he was offered the choice of any of the things that were in his che&s;ts, he &s;natched it up with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s, and would accept of nothing el&s;e. The &s;ame day a Chief, who had dined on board a few days before, accompanied by &s;ome of his women, who u&s;ed to feed him, came on board by him&s;elf, and when dinner was on table, the Captain helped him to &s;ome victuals, thinking upon this occa&s;ion he would conde&s;cend to feed him&s;elf; but he never at|tempted to eat, and had not one of the &s;ervants fed him, he would certainly have gone without his dinner.</P>
<P>In the afternoon they took the a&s;tronomical quadrant, with &s;ome other in&s;truments, on &s;hore.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 2d, having occa&s;ion to u&s;e the quadrant, to their great a&s;toni&s;hment and concern it was mi&s;&s;ing; this was the more ex|traordinary, as a centinel had been po&s;ted the whole night within a few yards of the tent in
<PB N="225" REF="237">
which it had been depo&s;ited; and it had never been taken out of the ca&s;e in which it was pack|ed. Their own people were at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected, imagining they might have mi&s;taken the contents for articles u&s;ed in traffic. They &s;earched the fort and the adjacent places, and a con&s;iderable reward was offered, as the lo&s;s of this in&s;tru|ment would have rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to have made the nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the Tran&s;it, one of the principal objects of their voyage. After every fruitle&s;s &s;earch had been made, Mr. Banks, accompanied by Mr. Green, and &s;ome other gentlemen, &s;et out for the woods, where he thought he might gain &s;ome intelligence of the robbery, if it had been committed by the natives. In the cour&s;e of their journey they met Tubora Tumaida, with a few of the natives, who was made by &s;igns to under&s;tand, that &s;ome of his countrymen had &s;tolen the quadrant, and Mr. Banks in|&s;i&s;ted upon being conducted to the place where it was concealed. Accordingly they proceeded together a few miles, and, after &s;ome enquiry, Tubora Tumaida received information of the thief, and that he was to be found at a place about four miles di&s;tant; as they had no other arms but a brace of pi&s;tols, and the &s;pot for which they were de&s;tined was at &s;o con&s;idera|ble a di&s;tance from the fort, they were not without &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of danger. They accordingly di&s;patched one of their company to
<PB N="226" REF="238">
Captain Cook, de&s;iring him to forward another party after them; having laid an embargo upon all the canoes in the bay; a party accordingly &s;at out, with the Captain at their head.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Mr. Green in the interim pur&s;ued their route, and at the very place which had been mentioned were met by one of Tu|bora Tumaida's own people, with part of the quadrant; &s;oon afterwards the box in which it had been packed, containing the other parts of it, was recovered; and, upon examination, though it had been taken to pieces, they had the &s;atisfaction to find it had received no mate|rial injury.</P>
<P>In the evening, when Mr. Banks and the other gentlemen, with Tubora Tumaida, re|turned, they were very much &s;urprized to find Tootahah confined in the fort, the gate of which was &s;urrounded by the natives, who ex|pre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t dread and anxiety on the occa&s;ion, as they had no other expectation but it was intended to put him to death.</P>
<P>Upon enquiry into this affair, it appeared that the Indians were &s;o much alarmed at Captain Cook's going up into the country with a party of armed men, that in the evening mo&s;t of them for&s;ook their habitations near the fort; a canoe likewi&s;e attempted to leave the bay, which the Lieutenant, who commanded on board the &s;hip, and had been ordered not to permit any canoe to go out, perceiving, di&s;patched
<PB N="227" REF="239">
a boat to detain her, but &s;he no &s;ooner came near them than they jumped into the &s;ea; a|mong this unfortunate number was Tootahah, who, being taken up, was &s;ent by the Lieutenant to the fort; and the commanding officer thought it his duty to detain him.</P>
<P>He could not be per&s;uaded that he was not to be put to death, till Captain Cook gave or|ders for him to be conducted out of the fort. He was received with great affection by the people, every one pre&s;&s;ing forward to em|brace him.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 3d, in the morning, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander attended as u&s;ual to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions, but the Indians brought nothing to market; nor could they procure any from &s;ome fi&s;hing-boats which came a-brea&s;t of the tents, though they were in great want of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit. Mr. Banks walk|ed into the woods, and heard great complaints from the people of the ill treatment of their Chief, who they &s;aid had been beaten, and otherwi&s;e ill u&s;ed, of which Mr. Banks declar|ed he was totally ignorant. The hogs which he had left as a pre&s;ent, were &s;ent for back by the Chief, which, probably, he was of opinion they had ill-de&s;erved. However, they would not &s;end them till he came him&s;elf, by which means they thought to procure a reconcilia|tion, knowing that ab&s;ence would promote that coolne&s;s between them, to which the fir&s;t
<PB N="228" REF="240">
interview might put an end, e&s;pecially as they were told, the Chief did not intend coming to the fort for near a fortnight.</P>
<P>Their provi&s;ions now were extremely &s;carce, and the markets ill &s;upplied, the people re&s;ent|ing the ill u&s;age their Chief had received. The next day, with &s;ome difficulty, Mr. Banks ob|tained a few ba&s;kets of bread-fruit from Tu|bora Tumaida in the woods, which were a very &s;ea&s;onable relief. An axe and &s;hirt were &s;ent for this day by Tootahah, in return for his two hogs which they promi&s;ed to bring him the next day. If they had not complied with this reque&s;t, they could have &s;carcely procur|ed any provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>After his &s;ending again early in the morn|ing, on Friday 5, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with the Captain, &s;et out in the pinnace, taking one of Tootahah's people with them, they &s;oon reached Eparre, the place where he dwelt, which was but a few miles to the we&s;t of the tents.</P>
<P>Upon their arrival, they found great num|bers of people upon the &s;hore waiting for them. They were immediately conducted to the Chief, whil&s;t the people &s;houted round them, <HI>Taio Tootahah,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Tootahah is your friend;"</Q> they found him &s;itting under a tree, and &s;ome old men &s;tanding round him. As &s;oon as he had made &s;igns for them to &s;it down, he a&s;ked for his axe, which Captain Cook pre&s;ented to him,
<PB N="229" REF="241">
with a &s;hirt and a broad cloth garment, with which he &s;eemed greatly plea&s;ed; and put the garment on. After eating a mouthful together in the boat, they were conducted to a large area, or court-yard, on one &s;ide of his hou&s;e, where an entertainment was provided for them, con&s;i&s;ting of wre&s;tling. The Chief &s;at at the upper end of the area, with &s;everal of his principal men on each &s;ide of him, by way of judges, from whom the conquerors received applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Ten or twelve combatants entered the area, and after many &s;imple ceremonies of challeng|ing each other, they engaged, endeavouring to throw one another by dint of &s;trength; then &s;eizing hold of each other by the thigh, the hand, the hair, or the cloaths, they grappled without the lea&s;t art, till one was thrown on his back; this conque&s;t was applauded by &s;ome words from the old men, and three huzzas. After one engagement &s;ucceeded another, but if they could not throw each other during the &s;pace of a minute, they parted either by con|&s;ent, or the intervention of their friends. Seve|ral women of rank were pre&s;ent; but it was thought, they would not have attended this amu&s;ement, only in compliment to the Engli&s;h gentlemen.</P>
<P>A man with a &s;tick, who made way for them when they landed, officiated here as ma&s;|ter of the ceremonies, keeping order among the people.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="242">When this entertainment was at an end, they were informed, that &s;ome hogs and a quantity of bread-fruit were preparing for their dinner; which intelligence was the more agreeable, as their appetites were at this time exceedingly keen. But in&s;tead of dining either on &s;hore or on board of the boat, they had the mortifica|tion of going as far as the &s;hip by the de&s;ire of the Chief.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Chief was known to be on board the &s;hip, the people brought plenty of bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other provi&s;ions to the fort.</P>
<P>On Monday 8, early in the morning, Mr. Molineux, the Ma&s;ter, and Mr. Green, &s;et out in the pinnace to the ea&s;tward, in order to pro|cure &s;ome hogs or poultry; but after proceed|ing a con&s;iderable way, and &s;eeing many hogs and a turtle, they could not purcha&s;e either. They belonged to Tootahah, and the people told them, that they could not &s;ell them with|out his con&s;ent; &s;o ab&s;olute was the power of this man.</P>
<P>They were now obliged, for the fir&s;t time, to bring out their nails to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions; for one of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, they obtained near twenty cocoa-nuts and &s;ome bread-fruit, &s;o that they &s;oon got great plenty.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day 9, in the forenoon, Oberea paid them a vi&s;it, accompanied by her favourite
<PB N="231" REF="243">
Obadee; &s;he pre&s;ented them with a hog and &s;ome bread-fruit.</P>
<P>The forge being now &s;et up and frequently at work, became not only a new &s;ubject of ad|miration to the Indians, but afforded the Cap|tain an additional opportunity of conferring ob|ligations on them, by permitting the &s;mith, during his lei&s;ure hours, to convert the old iron, which they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have procured from the Dolphin, into different kinds of tools.</P>
<P>The natives, after repeated attempts, finding them&s;elves incapable of pronouncing the names of the Engli&s;h gentlemen, had recour&s;e to new ones formed from their own language, Mr. Cook was named Toote; Hicks, Hete; Gore, Touara; Solander, Tolano; Banks, Opane; Green, Treene; and &s;o on for the greate&s;t part of the &s;hip's crew.</P>
<P>As Mr. Banks was &s;itting in his boat, tra|ding with them as u&s;ual, on Friday the 12th, a very extraordinary ceremony was performed by &s;ome ladies who were &s;trangers, to whom the re&s;t of the Indians giving way on each &s;ide, and forming a pa&s;&s;age, they advanced in proce&s;&s;ion towards Mr. Banks, to whom they pre&s;ented &s;ome parrots feathers, plantains, and other plants. They then brought a large bundle of cloth, con&s;i&s;ting of nine pieces, which being divided into three parcels, one of the women, who ap|peared to be the principal, &s;tepping on one of the parcels, pulled up all her cloaths as high as
<PB N="232" REF="244">
her wai&s;t, and then, with an air of unaffected &s;implicity, turned round three times. This ce|remony &s;he repeated in the &s;ame manner on the other two parcels of cloth, and the whole be|ing then pre&s;ented to Mr. Banks, the ladies went and &s;aluted him; in return for which he made them &s;uch pre&s;ents as he thought would gratify them the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The next evening Mr. Banks was under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of reprimanding, in very &s;trong terms, Tubora Tumaida, for having the in&s;olence to &s;natch his gun from him, and firing it in the air; a thing which &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Banks greatly, as he imagined him totally ignorant of the u&s;e of it. And as their &s;afety in a great mea&s;ure depended on keeping them in that &s;tate, he told him, with threats, that his touching his piece was the greate&s;t of in&s;ults. The Indian made no reply, but &s;et off with his family to his hou&s;e at Eparre. He being an u&s;eful man, Mr. Banks, accompanied by Mr. Molineux, thought fit to go after him, and they found him among a number of people, greatly dejected. How|ever, as Mr. Banks judiciou&s;ly cau&s;ed all ani|mo&s;ity to cea&s;e, they brought him back to &s;up|per; after which the Chief and his wife both &s;lept in Mr. Banks's tent. One of the natives, not intimidated by their pre&s;ence, attempted that very evening to &s;cale the walls of the fort, but was prevented by the centinel. The&s;e In|dians
<PB N="233" REF="245">
could not re&s;i&s;t making attempts to &s;teal the iron and iron tools within the works.</P>
<P>Sunday morning the 14th, divine &s;ervice was performed at the fort, in hopes that &s;ome of the principal Indians might be pre&s;ent, but mo&s;t of them returned home before the time. How|ever, Tubora Tumaida, and his wife Tomio, were pre&s;ent; they behaved with great decency, but without the lea&s;t apparent curio&s;ity. They made no enquiries with re&s;pect to the ceremo|nies, and their brethren were as little inqui&s;itive upon their return. This evening &s;everal of their people were witne&s;&s;es to an entertainment of a very extraordinary nature, which con&s;i&s;ted of the mo&s;t indecent acts of lewdne&s;s. For exam|ple, a young fellow cohabited in public with a girl about eleven or twelve years of age, with|out the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of &s;hame; and what is &s;till more extraordinary, Oberea, with &s;everal other females of the fir&s;t rank, were pre&s;ent during the whole time.</P>
<P>On Monday the 15th, Mr. Banks detected Tu|bora Tamaida in having &s;tolen &s;ome nails. Mr. Banks having a good opinion of this Chief, was willing to put his fidelity to the te&s;t, and &s;everal temptations were thrown in his way, a|mong the re&s;t a ba&s;ket of nails, which proved irre&s;i&s;tible. He confe&s;&s;ed the fact, and upon Mr Banks's in&s;i&s;ting upon re&s;titution, he de|clared the nails were at Eparre; this occa&s;ioned high words, and at length the Indian produced
<PB N="234" REF="246">
one of them. He was to have been forgiven upon re&s;toring the re&s;t, but not having re&s;olu|tion to fulfil his engagement, he fled with his furniture and family before night.</P>
<P>On the 17th, one of the natives who came in the morning before day-light to &s;teal &s;ome ca&s;ks, it not being the fir&s;t offence, the centinel &s;napped his gun at him, but it mi&s;&s;ing fire he e&s;caped.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day 24, Tootahah having &s;ent many me&s;&s;ages to reque&s;t a vi&s;it from the Cap|tain, declaring that he would acknowledge the compliment by a pre&s;ent of &s;ome hogs. Mr. Hicks the fir&s;t Lieutenant was &s;ent, in hopes of getting the hogs without the vi&s;it. He was re|ceived in a very friendly manner at a place call|ed Tettehah, five miles farther to the we&s;tward, where Tootahah had taken up his re&s;idence. He brought away one hog only, which had been produced immediately upon his arrival, with a promi&s;e of receiving more the next morning; but, when morning came, he was obliged to depart without them. Mr. Banks, on the 25th, &s;eeing Tubora and his wife Tomio at the tent, for the fir&s;t time after he &s;tole the nails, endea|voured to per&s;uade him to re&s;tore them, but in vain. He was treated with great coolne&s;s during his &s;hort &s;tay, and his departure was very abrupt.</P>
<P>On the 27th of May, Tootahah being remov|ed to a place called <HI>Atahourou,</HI> Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Captain Cook, and &s;ome others, &s;et
<PB N="235" REF="247">
out in the pinnace to pay him a vi&s;it; after making pre&s;ents of a few trifling articles, they were invited to &s;tay the night. Mr. Banks hav|ing accepted of a place in Oberea's canoe, left his companions, in order to retire to re&s;t. Not|with&s;tanding the care Oberea took of his cloaths, by having them in her own cu&s;tody, they were &s;tolen with his pi&s;tols, powder-horn, and many other things that were in his wai&s;t|coat pockets. The alarm was given to Toota|hah, who &s;lept in the next canoe, and who went with Oberea in &s;earch of the thief, leaving Mr. Banks with only his breeches on, and his mu&s;quet uncharged. They &s;oon returned, but without &s;ucce&s;s; Mr. Banks thought proper to put up with the lo&s;s for the pre&s;ent, and a &s;econd time endeavour to &s;leep. But he had &s;carce compo&s;ed him&s;elf, before he heard &s;ome mu&s;ick, and perceived lights at a &s;mall di&s;tance from &s;hore; this proved to be a concert, which they call Heiva. Mr. Banks judged it then nece&s;&s;ary to get up and try to find his companions. As &s;oon as he approached the lights, he found the hut, where Mr. Cook and three of his a&s;&s;oci|ates lay, and began to relate his melancholy tale; but in&s;tead of receiving much comfort from them, he was told, that they had &s;hared the &s;ame fate, having lo&s;t their &s;tockings and jackets. However, this did not prevent their hearing out the concert, which con&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="236" REF="248">
drums, flutes, and &s;everal voices; after which they retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>The next morning Mr. Banks got his mu&s;|quet from Tupia, with whom he had intru&s;ted it, and &s;ome cloaths from Oberea; in which he made a whim&s;ical appearance. They then got together, and were joined by Dr. Solander, who was the only one among them that had not been robbed, having &s;lept at a hou&s;e about a mile di&s;tant. As to the others they were obliged to put up with their lo&s;s; their cloaths, &amp;c. hav|ing never been heard of afterwards. They &s;et out for the boat not very well plea&s;ed, carry|ing with them only one hog, which had been intended for their &s;upper the night before.</P>
<P>In their return to the boat, they were greatly amu&s;ed by &s;eeing &s;ome Indians &s;wimming for their diver&s;ion, amid&s;t a &s;urf, which no Eu|ropean boat could have lived in, or the be&s;t &s;wimmer in Europe have &s;aved him&s;elf from drowning, had he by accident been ex|po&s;ed to its fury. This extraordinary &s;urf breaks upon the &s;hore in a few places, where acce&s;s to the i&s;land is not guarded by a reef, and makes it very dreadful and dangerous.</P>
<P>Some Indians from a neighbouring i&s;land, to which Captain Wallis gave the name of DUKE OF YORK'S ISLAND, informed them of more than twenty i&s;lands in the neighbourhood of Otaheite.</P>
<P>They now began to make nece&s;&s;ary prepara|tions for ob&s;erving the Tran&s;it of Venus, and,
<PB N="237" REF="249">
from the hints Mr. Cook had received from the Royal Society, he &s;ent out two parties to make ob&s;ervations from different &s;pots, that in ca&s;e they failed at Otaheite, they might &s;ucceed el&s;e|where; they employed them&s;elves in preparing their in&s;truments, and in&s;tructing &s;uch gentle|men with the u&s;e of them, as were to go out. And on Thur&s;day the 1&s;t of June, the next Saturday being the day of the Tran&s;it, they &s;ent the long boat to Eimayo, having on board Mr. Gore, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, and Mr. Sporing, a friend of Mr. Banks; each furni&s;hed with ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;truments by Mr. Green. Mr. Banks and &s;everal of the Indians went out with this party. Others were di&s;patched to find out a convenient &s;pot, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their principal &s;tation, as might &s;uit their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who went to Eimayo in the long boat, after rowing the be&s;t part of the night, by the help of &s;ome Indians aboard a canoe, which they hailed, found a proper &s;ituation for their Ob&s;ervatory upon a rock, which ro&s;e out of the water about one hundred and forty yards from the &s;hore, where they fixed their tents, and pre|pared the apparatus for the following day's ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 3d, as &s;oon as it was light, Mr. Banks left them to go to the i&s;land for fre&s;h provi&s;ions. As he was trading with the natives who belonged to Tarrao, the King of the i&s;land, his maje&s;ty arrived with his &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e name
<PB N="238" REF="250">
was Nuna, in order to pay him a vi&s;it. It be|ing cu&s;tomary among the&s;e people to be &s;eated during their conferences, Mr. Banks &s;pread on the ground his Indian cloth turban, that he wore in&s;tead of a hat, on which they all &s;at down. After this the royal pre&s;ent was brought, con|&s;i&s;ting of a hog and a dog, &s;ome cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, &amp;c. A me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched by Mr. Banks for an adze, a &s;hirt, and &s;ome beads, and they were pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, who re|ceived them with great plea&s;ure. Tubora Turma|ida and Tomio, Indians who had gone with Mr. Banks upon the expedition, came from the Ob|&s;ervatory: Tomio, &s;aid to be related to Tarrao, brought him a long nail, and a &s;hirt for Nuna, by way of pre&s;ents. Mr. Banks returned to the Ob&s;ervatory with Tarrao, Nuna, and three beau|tiful young women, their chief attendants. He &s;hewed them the Tran&s;it of Venus over the Sun, and informed them, that he and his companions had come from their own country &s;olely to view it in that &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The produce of this i&s;land, according to the in&s;pection of Mr. Banks, proved to be much the &s;ame as that of Otaheite, the people al&s;o re&s;embling tho&s;e of that i&s;land, many of them he had &s;een upon it, who were well acquainted with the value of the trading articles.</P>
<P>Both the parties which were &s;ent out, made their ob&s;ervation with great &s;ucce&s;s. They neverthele&s;s differed in the accounts of the times

<P>While they were viewing the Tran&s;it of Venus, &s;ome of the &s;hip's company broke into one of the &s;tore-rooms, and &s;tole a quantity of &s;pike-nails. As the circulation of the&s;e nails might have been greatly detrimental to them, &s;trict &s;earch was made, and one of the thieves was detected. He had only a few in his cu&s;tody; but was however puni&s;hed with two dozen la&s;hes.</P>
<P>The death of an old woman of &s;ome di&s;|tinction gave them an opportunity of ob&s;erv|ing the manner of the Indians di&s;po&s;ing of their dead, whom they never bury. The kind of bier, on which the corp&s;e is depo&s;ited, has al|ready
<PB N="240" REF="253">
been de&s;cribed, and the bread-fruit, &amp;c. placed as before, which Tubora Tumaida in|formed Mr. Banks was depo&s;ited as an offering to their Gods. A &s;ort of &s;tile was placed in the front of the &s;quare, where the relations of the decea&s;ed &s;tood to te&s;tify their &s;orrow; be|neath the awning were &s;everal pieces of cloth, on which were the tears and blood of the mourners, for upon the&s;e occa&s;ions they wound them&s;elves with a &s;hark's tooth. At a &s;mall di&s;tance two temporary hou&s;es were erected, in one of which &s;ome of the relations of the decea&s;ed con&s;tantly remained, and in the other the chief mourner re&s;ided, who was dre&s;&s;ed in a peculiar manner, to perform a particular cere|mony. After the corp&s;e is rotten, the bones are buried near the &s;pot. It was afterwards di&s;|covered, that the&s;e repo&s;itories of the dead were u&s;ed al&s;o for religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>There having been a &s;carcity of bread-fruit for &s;ome days, an enquiry was made of the cau&s;e, and the rea&s;ons the Indians gave was, that there being a great crop, the fruit had been gathered to make a &s;ort of &s;our pa&s;te, which the natives call <HI>Mabie,</HI> which, after fermenta|tion, will keep a long time, and &s;upply them in times of dearth.</P>
<P>The funeral ceremony, in honour of the old woman, was performed on the 10th by the chief mourner, and Mr. Banks was &s;o de&s;irous to be a &s;pectator, that he agreed to take a part
<PB N="241" REF="254">
in the performance of this ceremony, being in|formed, that he could not be pre&s;ent on any other condition. He accordingly went in the evening to the place where the body was de|po&s;ited, there he was met by the relations of the decea&s;ed, and afterwards joined by &s;everal other per&s;ons. The chief mourner was Tu|bora Tumaida; his dre&s;s was whim&s;ical, though not altogether ungrateful. Mr. Banks was obliged to quit his European dre&s;s, and he had no other covering than a &s;mall piece of cloth, which was tied round his middle; his body was then blacked with charcoal and water, as were the bodies of &s;everal others, particularly &s;ome females, who were as little covered as him&s;elf; the proce&s;&s;ion then began. The chief mourner uttered &s;ome words, that were judged to be a prayer, when he approached the body; and he repeated it as he came up to his own hou&s;e. After this the proce&s;&s;ion went on, by per|mi&s;&s;ion, towards the fort. It is u&s;ual for the Indians to &s;hun the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions as much as po&s;&s;ible; they accordingly ran into the woods in great ha&s;te, as &s;oon at it came in view. From the fort it proceeded along the &s;hore. Hav|ing cro&s;&s;ed the river, it entered the woods, pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal hou&s;es, which became immedi|ately uninhabited; and, during the re&s;t of the proce&s;&s;ion, which continued above half an hour, not a &s;ingle Indian was vi&s;ible. Mr. Banks filled an office they called <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and there
<PB N="242" REF="255">
were two others in the &s;ame character. When none of the other natives were to be &s;een, they approached the chief mourner, &s;aying, <HI>imatata</HI>; then tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ceremony bathed in the river, and re&s;umed their cu&s;to|mary dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Such was this uncommon ceremony, in which Mr. Banks performed a capital part, and met with the applau&s;e of Tubora Tumaida, the chief mourner.</P>
<P>Complaint was made on Monday the 12th to the Captain, that the Indians had lo&s;t &s;ome bows and arrows, and &s;trings of plaited hair; the affair was enquired into, and the fact being well atte&s;ted, two dozen la&s;hes were inflicted upon each of the criminals.</P>
<P>The bows and arrows of the Indians have not hitherto been noticed; but this day Tubora Tu|maida brought his hither, occa&s;ioned by a chal|lenge he had received from Mr. Gore. The Indian Chief imagined it was a trial of &s;kill who could &s;hoot the farthe&s;t; but Mr. Gore propo|&s;ed &s;hooting at a mark. The mi&s;take being &s;oon di&s;covered, the champions declined the trial. The Indian, however, to di&s;play his &s;kill, drew his bow, and &s;ent an arrow, unfeathered, as they all were, nearly the &s;ixth part of a mile. They &s;hoot kneeling, and drop the bow the in|&s;tant the arrow is di&s;charged.</P>
<P>In this morning's excur&s;ion, Mr. Banks met &s;everal of the natives, who were itinerant mu&s;i|cians,
<PB N="243" REF="256">
and the place of the evening's rendez|vous being known, all the Engli&s;h gentlemen went thither to partake of the diver&s;ion. Their in&s;truments were flutes and drums, and a great number of the Indians were got together upon the occa&s;ion. The drummers &s;ung to the mu|&s;ic, and to the a&s;toni&s;hment of Mr. Banks and the re&s;t of his companions they found, that they were the chief &s;ubject of the min&s;trels lays. The&s;e &s;ongs mu&s;t, therefore, have been extem|poraneous, the rewards whereof were &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;aries as they required.</P>
<P>An iron coal rake for the oven being &s;tole in the night of the 14th, and many other things having at different times been taken by the In|dians, the Captain judged it of &s;ome con&s;e|quence, if po&s;&s;ible, to put an end to the&s;e prac|tices, by making it their common intere&s;t to prevent it. He had already given &s;trict orders, that the centinels &s;hould not fire upon them, even if they were detected in the fact. About twenty-&s;even of their double canoes with &s;ails were ju&s;t come in with cargoes of fi&s;h, which the Captain &s;eized, and then gave notice, that unle&s;s the rake, and all the other things, which had at different times been &s;tolen, were return|ed, the ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be burnt. The Captain had, indeed, no &s;uch de&s;ign, as will appear by the event. The menace produced no other ef|fect than the re&s;titution of the rake, all the other things remaining in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="244" REF="257">
at length the Captain thought proper to give up the cargoes, as the innocent natives were in great di&s;tre&s;s for want of them; and at la&s;t, to prevent confu&s;ion, from the difficulty of a&s;|certaining to whom the different lots belonged, he promi&s;ed al&s;o to relea&s;e the canoes.</P>
<P>About this time another event had nearly in|volved the Engli&s;h in a quarrel with the Indi|ans. The Captain having &s;ent a boat on &s;hore to get balla&s;t, the officer not meeting immedi|ately with what he wanted, began to pull down one of their &s;epulchral buildings: this mea&s;ure was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the Indians. Mr. Banks, having received intelligence of the affair, repaired to the &s;pot, and the matter was &s;oon amicably terminated, there being &s;tones &s;uffici|ent found el&s;ewhere. This was the only oppo|&s;ition they had, hitherto, made, and the only per&s;onal in&s;ult received (be&s;ides the affair of the mu&s;ket at the tent, for which the Indian forfeit|ed his life) was by Mr. Monkhou&s;e, who having pulled a flower within one of their burial inclo|&s;ures, was &s;truck by an Indian; the gentleman laid hold of him, but he was re&s;cued by two more, who pulling Mr. Monkhou&s;e's hair forced him to quit his hold, after which they all ran off.</P>
<P>On the 19th in the evening, &s;oon after dark, while the canoes were detained by the Captain, Oberea the Queen, and &s;everal of her attend|ants, paid the gentlemen a vi&s;it; &s;he came from Tootahah's palace, in a double canoe, and
<PB N="245" REF="258">
brought with her a hog, bread-fruit, and other pre&s;ents, among which was a dog; but none of the things that had been &s;tolen; tho&s;e &s;he plead|ed had been taken away by her gallant Obadee, for which &s;he had beaten him. She did not, however, &s;eem to think her &s;tory de&s;erved cre|dit, but appeared at fir&s;t much terrified, though &s;he &s;urmounted her fears with great fortitude; and was de&s;irous of &s;leeping with her attendants in Mr. Bank's tent; but this being refu&s;ed, &s;he was obliged to pa&s;s the night in her canoe. The Captain declined accepting of her pre&s;ents, at which &s;he &s;eemed very &s;orrowful. Mr. Banks and the re&s;t of the gentlemen retired to bed, and a whole tribe of the Indians would have &s;lept in the bell-tent, but were not permitted.</P>
<P>The next morning the Queen returned to the fort, and Captain Cook having altered his mind accepted of her pre&s;ents. Two of her attend|ants were very earne&s;t in getting them&s;elves hu&s;|bands, in which they &s;ucceeded, by means of the Surgeon and one of the Lieutenants: they &s;eemed very agreeable till bed-time, and deter|mined to lie in Mr. Banks's tent, which they accordingly did, till the Surgeon having &s;ome words with one of them Mr. Banks thru&s;t her out, and &s;he was followed by the re&s;t, except Otea Tea, who cried for &s;ome time, till he turn|ed her out al&s;o. This had like to have become a &s;erious affair, a duel being talked of between Mr. Banks and Mr. Monkhou&s;e, but it was hap|pily
<PB N="246" REF="259">
avoided. Dogs are e&s;teemed here more delicate eating than pork; as tho&s;e bread to be eaten ta&s;te no animal food, but live entirely up|on vegetables; and the experiment was tried. Tupia undertook to kill and dre&s;s him, which he did, by making a hole in the ground and baking him. It was agreed by every one to be a very good di&s;h.</P>
<P>They were vi&s;ited on the 21&s;t at the fort by many of the natives, who brought various kinds of pre&s;ents, and among the re&s;t Oamo, a Chief of &s;everal di&s;tricts on the i&s;land, whom they had never before &s;een, who brought with him a hog. This Chief was treated with great re&s;pect by the natives, and was accompanied by a boy, and a young woman. The boy was carried upon a man's back, though he was very able to walk. Oberea and &s;ome other of the Indians went out of the fort to meet them, their heads and bo|dies being fir&s;t uncovered as low as the wai&s;t. This was con&s;idered as a mark of re&s;pect, they had not noticed it before, but judged it was u&s;u|ally &s;hewn to per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank a|mong them. Oamo entered the tent, but the young woman, who was about &s;ixteen, could not be prevailed upon to accompany him, tho' &s;he &s;eemed to combat with her curio&s;ity and in|clination. Dr. Solander took the youth by the hand, and conducted him in; but the natives without, who had prevented the girl's entrance, &s;oon found means to get him out again.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="260">The curio&s;ity of Mr. Banks and the other gentlemen being excited from the&s;e circum|&s;tances, they made enquiry, who the&s;e &s;trangers were, and were informed, that Oamo was Obe|rea's hu&s;band, but that by mutual con&s;ent they had been for a con&s;iderable time &s;eparated; and that the youth and girl were their offspring. The boy was named <HI>Terridiri,</HI> and was heir ap|parent to the &s;overeignty of the i&s;land; and he was to e&s;pou&s;e his &s;i&s;ter as &s;oon as he had at|tained the proper age. The pre&s;ent &s;overeign being a minor, called OUTOU, and &s;on of Whap|pai; Whappai, Oamo, and Tootahah, were all brothers; Whappai was the &s;enior, and Oamo the next; wherefore, Whappai having no child but Outou, Terridiri, &s;on of Oamo, was heir to the &s;overeignty. To us it will appear &s;ingular, that a boy &s;hould reign during the life of his father; but in the i&s;land of Otaheite, a boy &s;ucceeds to his father's authority and title as &s;oon as he is born; when a regent is elected, which office u&s;ually falls upon the father, till the boy becomes of age: at this time, howe|ver, the election had fallen upon his uncle Tootahah, on account of his warlike exploits. Oamo was very inqui&s;itive with re&s;pect to the Engli&s;h, and by his que&s;tions he appeared a man of under&s;tanding and penetration.</P>
<P>A woman called Teetee, who came from the we&s;t of the i&s;land, pre&s;ented to the Captain an elegant garment, of a bright yellow ground,
<PB N="248" REF="261">
bordered with red, and in the middle of it were &s;everal cro&s;&s;es, which they had probably learn|ed from the French.</P>
<P>On the 23d in the morning, one of their hands being mi&s;&s;ing, they enquired for him a|mong the natives, and were told that he was at Eparre, Tootahah's re&s;idence in the wood; and one of the Indians offered to fetch him back, which he did that evening. On his re|turn he informed them, that he had been taken from the fort, and carried to the top of the bay, by three men, who having &s;tripped him, forced him into a canoe, and conducted him to Eparre, where he received &s;ome cloaths from Tootahah, who endeavoured to prevail on him to continue there. They had great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e this account true, for the natives were no &s;ooner ac|quainted with his return, than they left the fort with much precipitation.</P>
<P>Monday June 26, early in the morning, the Captain &s;et out in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, to circumnavigate the i&s;land. They &s;ailed to the ea&s;tward, and in the forenoon they went on &s;hore, in a part of the i&s;land under the government of Ahio, a young Chief, who had often vi&s;ited them at the tents. They al&s;o found here &s;ome other natives of their acquain|tance. They then proceeded together to the harbour, wherein M. Bougainville lay when he vi&s;ited this i&s;land, and were &s;hewn the ground on which he fixed his tent, and the watering-place.
<PB N="249" REF="262">
They al&s;o met with <HI>Orette,</HI> a Chief, who was their particular friend, who&s;e brother went away with M. Bougainville.</P>
<P>Having taken a &s;urvey of this harbour, and a large bay near which it is &s;ituated, they propo&s;ed going to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bay, but Titubaola, who was their con|ductor, not only refu&s;ed to accompany them, but endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade the Captain and Mr. Banks from going, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That coun|try was inhabited by people who were not &s;ubjects to Tootahah, and who would de&s;troy them all."</Q> This information did not, how|ever, prevent the execution of their de&s;ign; and upon loading their pieces with ball, Titubaola took courage to go with them; they row|ed till it was dark, when they reached a narrow neck of land, that divided the i&s;land into two penin&s;ulas, which are di&s;tinct governments. As they were not yet got into the ho&s;tile part of the country, they agreed to &s;pend the night on &s;hore, where they were provided with &s;upper and lodging by Ooratooa, the lady who paid her compliments to Mr. Banks in &s;o remarkable a manner at the fort.</P>
<P>In the morning they pur&s;ued their pa&s;&s;age for the other government.</P>
<P>They landed in a di&s;trict, which was governed by a Chief, named MARAITATA, the <HI>burying place of men,</HI> and his father was called PAHAI|REDE, the <HI>&s;tealer of boats.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="250" REF="263">
their names were &s;o ominous, they gave the Captain and Mr. Banks a very civil reception; furni&s;hed them with provi&s;ions, and &s;old them a large hog for a hatchet. The curio&s;ity of the natives was &s;oon excited, and a crowd gathered round the Engli&s;h gentlemen, but they &s;aw only two people whom they knew, neither did they ob&s;erve any trinkets that had come out of the Endeavour, though they met with &s;everal Eu|ropean commodities, particularly two twelve pound &s;hot, one of which had the Engli&s;h broad arrow upon it, though the Indians &s;aid they had them from M. Bougainville's people. They then advanced till they reached the di&s;trict, which was under the dominion of the principal Chief, or King, named <HI>Waheatua,</HI> who had a &s;on, but it was not known in who&s;e hands the &s;overeign power was lodged. Here they found a &s;pacious verdant plain, watered by a river of &s;o great a width, that they were obliged to pa&s;s it in a canoe, but their Indian followers &s;wam over it with the greate&s;t facility. There was no hou&s;e that appeared inhabited; but the ruins of &s;everal large ones. Having continued their journey along the &s;hore for a con&s;iderable way, they at la&s;t &s;aw the Chief, and with him an agreeable young wo|man about two and twenty, named Toudidde. They were not unacquainted with her name, as they had often heard it mentioned by the na|tives; and they had great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was the Queen of this penin&s;ula.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="264">In pa&s;&s;ing through this part of the i&s;land, they found it better cultivated, and more im|proved than any they had hitherto met with; though the hou&s;es were but few, and tho&s;e very &s;mall, but there were a great number of canoes which excelled any they had &s;een, both in &s;ize and workman&s;hip. The burial places were likewi&s;e numerous, being found not only at every point, but at different places in the in|terior parts of the i&s;land. The&s;e buildings nearly re&s;embled, in form, tho&s;e which they had &s;een at Opouroenu, but they were neater, and adorned with carvings of various figures; in one there was a cock, which was painted in imitation of the natural colour of the feathers of that bird. Notwith&s;tanding the fertility of the country, and its being well cultivated, &s;carce any bread-fruit was to be met with, and the inha|bitants &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly upon a nut, called <HI>ahee.</HI></P>
<P>Finding them&s;elves fatigued, they now took to their boat, and in the evening landed on an i&s;land named Otooareite; being in want of &s;ome refre&s;hment, Mr. Banks went into the woods to try what he could obtain, but it being dark, he met with no inhabitants and but one hou&s;e, in which he found only a bread-fruit, and a few of the nuts before-mentioned; nor were they more &s;ucce&s;sful in procuring provi&s;ions the next morning.</P>
<P>Towards the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the i&s;land they found a good harbour, formed by a reef,
<PB N="252" REF="265">
and the circumjacent country is remarkably fruitful. At about three miles di&s;tant they land|ed, at a place where they found &s;everal of the natives, with whom they were intimately ac|quainted. After having, with a good deal of difficulty, obtained &s;ome cocoa-nuts, they again embarked.</P>
<P>They landed again a little further to the ea&s;t. Mathiabo, the Chief, with whom they had no acquaintance, nor had ever &s;een before, &s;oon came to them, and &s;upplied them with cocoa-nuts and bread fruit. They al&s;o purcha&s;ed a hog of him for a gla&s;s bottle, which he took in preference to every other thing that was of|fered him. They &s;aw here a turkey cock and a goo&s;e which the Dolphin left on the i&s;land, they were remarkably fat, and &s;eemed to be greatly admired by the Indians.</P>
<P>A very uncommon &s;ight pre&s;ented it&s;elf in a hou&s;e near this place, &s;everal human jaw-bones were fa&s;tened to a board of a &s;emicircular form; they &s;eemed fre&s;h, and had not lo&s;t any of their teeth; but Mr. Banks could obtain no expla|nation of this my&s;tery. Upon their quitting the place, the Chief accompanied them, and piloted them over the &s;hoals. They opened the bay in the evening, on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which corre&s;ponded with that on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, in &s;uch a manner, as to inter&s;ect the i&s;land at the i&s;thmus.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="266">Several canoes came off here with &s;ome very beautiful women, who appeared to be de&s;irous of their going on &s;hore, to which they readily a&s;&s;ented. They met with a very friendly recep|tion from the Chief, who&s;e name was Wiverou, who gave directions to &s;ome of his people to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them in dre&s;&s;ing their provi&s;ions, which were now very plentiful, and they &s;upped at Wive|rou's hou&s;e, in company with Mathiabo. Part of the hou&s;e was allotted for them to &s;leep in, and &s;oon after &s;upper they retired to re&s;t. Ma|thiabo having obtained a cloak from Mr. Banks, under pretence of u&s;ing it as a cover-let when he lay down, immediately made off with it, unper|ceived by that gentleman or his companions. News however of the robbery was &s;oon brought them by one of the natives; in con&s;equence of which intelligence they &s;at out in pur&s;uit of the thief, but had proceeded a very little way before they were met by a per&s;on bringing back the cloak, which Mathiabo had given up through fear.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e, upon their return, was entirely de&s;erted, and about four in the morning the centinel gave the alarm, that the boat was mi&s;|&s;ing. Mr. Banks and the Captain were greatly a&s;toni&s;hed at this account, and ran to the water|&s;ide, but though the morning was clear and &s;tar|light, no boat was vi&s;ible. Their &s;ituation was now extremely terrifying: the party con&s;i&s;ting of but four, with a &s;ingle mu&s;ket and two
<PB N="254" REF="267">
pocket pi&s;tols, without a &s;pare ball or a charge of powder. After remaining in this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of anxiety for a con&s;iderable time, dread|ing the advantage the Indians would take of it, to their great joy, the boat, which had been driven away by the tide, returned; Mr. Banks and his companions no &s;ooner breakfa&s;ted than they departed. This place is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of Tiarrabou, the &s;outh-ea&s;t penin|&s;ula of the i&s;land, about five miles ea&s;t from the i&s;thmus, with a harbour equal to any in the i&s;land. It was fertile and populous, and the in|habitants every where behaved with civility. The la&s;t di&s;trict in Tiarrabou, in which they landed, was governed by a Chief, named OMOE. He was building a hou&s;e, and was ve|ry de&s;irous of purcha&s;ing a hatchet, but Mr. Banks and the Captain had not one left. He would not trade for nails, and they embarked; the Chief following them in a canoe with his wife, in hopes of obtaining &s;omething u&s;eful to him. The Chief and his wife were after|wards taken on board, and after having gone about three miles, they de&s;ired to be put on &s;hore, and their reque&s;t was complied with, when the Captain met with &s;ome of Omoe's people, who had brought with them a very large hog. The Chief agreed to exchange the hog for a large axe and a nail, and to bring the bea&s;t to the fort in Port Royal Bay. This re&s;o|lution he came to after con&s;ulting with his wife;
<PB N="255" REF="268">
and Mr. Banks judged the exchange to be very advantageous to the Engli&s;h, as the hog was a remarkable fine one.</P>
<P>At this place they &s;aw one of their Eatuas, or Gods, it was made of wicker-work, and re|&s;embled the figure of a man; it was near &s;even feet in height, and was covered with black and white feathers; on the head were four protube|rances, which the natives called <HI>Tate ete,</HI> or little men.</P>
<P>Having taken their leave of Omoe, they &s;at out on their return; after rowing a few miles, they went on &s;hore again, but &s;aw nothing re|markable except a &s;epulchral building, which was ornamented in an extraordinary manner. The pavement, on which was built a pyramid, was very neat; at a little di&s;tance there was an image of &s;tone, very uncouthly carved, which the natives &s;eemed to hold in a great e&s;timation.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed through the harbour, which was the only one fit for &s;hipping, on the &s;outh of Opoureonu, &s;ituated about five miles to the we&s;tward of the i&s;thmus, between two &s;mall i&s;lands not far from &s;hore, and within a mile of each other. They were now near the di&s;trict, named Paparra, which was governed by Oamo and Oberea, where they intended to &s;pend the night. Mr. Banks and his company landed about an hour before it was dark, and found that they were both &s;et out to pay them a vi&s;it at the fort. They neverthele&s;s &s;lept at the hou&s;e
<PB N="256" REF="269">
of Oberea, which, though not large, was very neat; no inhabitant but her father was now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, who &s;hewed them much civili|ty. They took this opportunity of walking out to a point, upon which they had ob&s;erved, at a di&s;tance, &s;ome trees, called Etoa, which u&s;ually grow on the burial-places of the&s;e people. They call the&s;e burying-grounds Morai, which are al&s;o places of wor&s;hip. They here &s;aw an immen&s;e edifice, which they found to be the Morai of Oamo and Oberea, which was by far the mo&s;t con&s;iderable piece of architecture to be found in the i&s;land.</P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ted of an enormous pile of &s;tone work, rai&s;ed in the form of a pyramid, with a flight of &s;teps on each &s;ide, &s;omething after the manner of tho&s;e little buildings, which are com|monly erected in England to place the pillars of &s;un dials upon; it was near two hundred and &s;eventy feet long, and about one-third as wide, and between forty and fifty feet high.</P>
<P>The foundation con&s;i&s;ted of rock-&s;tones, the &s;teps of coral, and the upper part of round pebbles, all of the &s;ame &s;hape and &s;ize; the rock and coral &s;tones were &s;quared with the ut|mo&s;t neatne&s;s and regularity, and the whole building appeared as compact and firm, as if it had been erected by the be&s;t workmen in Eu|rope. As the Indians were totally de&s;titute of iron uten&s;ils to &s;hape their &s;tones, as well as mortar to cement them, when they had made

them fit for u&s;e, a &s;tructure of &s;uch heighth and magnitude, mu&s;t have been a work of in|finite labour and fatigue.</P>
<P>In the center of the &s;ummit was the repre|&s;entation of a bird, carved in wood; clo&s;e to this was the figure of a fi&s;h; which was in &s;tone. This pyramid made part of one &s;ide of a wide court or &s;quare, the &s;ides of which were nearly equal; the whole was walled in, and paved with flat &s;tones. Within this place grew (notwith&s;tanding it was in this manner pav|ed) &s;everal plantains, and trees which the natives call Etoa. At a little di&s;tance to the we&s;t of this edifice was another paved &s;quare, which contained &s;everal &s;mall &s;tages, called by the natives Ewattas, which appeared to be altars; upon them they place provi&s;ions, as &s;acrifices to their gods: Mr. Banks afterwards ob&s;erved whole hogs placed upon the&s;e ewattas, or altars.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the i&s;land of Otaheite &s;eem in nothing &s;o de&s;irous of excelling each other as in the grandeur and magnificence of their &s;epulchres; and the rank and authority of Oberea was forcibly evinced upon this occa&s;ion. The gentlemen of the Endeavour, it has been ob&s;erved, did not find Oberea po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame power, as when the Dolphin was at this place, and they were now informed of the cau&s;e. The way from her hou&s;e to the Morai, was by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and they ob&s;erved, in all places as they pa&s;&s;ed along, a great number of
<PB N="258" REF="272">
human bones. Inquiry being made into the cau&s;e of this extraordinary &s;ight, they were in|formed, that about four or five months before Captain Cook's arrival, the inhabitants of Ti|arrabou, the penin&s;ula to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, made a de&s;cent here, and &s;lew many of the people, who&s;e bones were tho&s;e that were &s;een upon the coa&s;t: that hereupon Oberea and Oamo, who then held the government for his &s;on, had fled and taken refuge in the mountains; and that the victors de&s;troyed all the hou&s;es, and pillag|ed the country. Mr. Banks was al&s;o informed, that the turkey and goo&s;e which he had &s;een in the di&s;trict of Mathiabo, were among the boo|ty; this afforded a rea&s;on for their being found where the Dolphin had little or no corre&s;pon|dence; and the jaw-bones, being mentioned, which had been &s;een hanging in a hou&s;e, he was informed, that they had likewi&s;e been carried off as trophies. The jaw-bones of their ene|mies being con&s;idered by the natives of this i&s;land, as great a mark of triumph, as &s;calps are by the Indians of North America.</P>
<P>On Friday the 30th they arrived at Otahou|rou, where their old acquaintance Tootahah re&s;ided; he received them with great civility, and provided for them a good &s;upper, and a convenient lodging; and notwith&s;tanding they were &s;o &s;hamefully plundered the la&s;t time, they &s;lept with this chief. They &s;pent the night in
<PB N="259" REF="273">
the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity, none of their cloaths, or any other article, being mi&s;&s;ing in the morning.</P>
<P>On Saturday, July 1, they returned to the fort at Fort Royal Harbour; having di&s;covered the i&s;land, both penin&s;ulas included, to be about one hundred miles in circumference. They were now very much in want of bread-fruit, owing to the &s;carcity of the &s;ea&s;on, and could obtain but a very &s;mall quantity upon their whole tour.</P>
<P>Their Indian friends crouded about them up|on their return, and none of them came with|out provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Monday the 3d, Mr. Banks made an excur|&s;ion, with &s;ome Indian guides, to trace the ri|ver up the valley to its &s;ource, and ob&s;erve to what extent its banks were inhabited. After meeting with hou&s;es for the &s;pace of &s;ix miles, they came up to one which was &s;aid to be the la&s;t that could be &s;een. The ma&s;ter of it pre|&s;ented them with cocoa-nuts and other fruits; and after a &s;hort vi&s;it, they continued their walk. In this tour they often pa&s;&s;ed under vaults, form|ed by rocky fragments, in which, they were in|formed, that tho&s;e who were benighted often took refuge. They pur&s;ued the cour&s;e of the river for about five or &s;ix miles further, and found it banked on both &s;ides by rocks which were almo&s;t perpendicular, and near one hun|dred feet high, notwith&s;tanding which, a way was to be traced up the&s;e dreadful precipices,
<PB N="260" REF="274">
and their Indian guides offered to conduct them by this path to the &s;ummit; but as it could not be effected without the utmo&s;t difficulty and danger, and there appeared nothing at the top to recompence them for the fatigue and hazard of the undertaking, they declined attemping it.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks during this tour had a fine oppor|tunity of &s;earching for minerals among the rocks, which were almo&s;t, on all &s;ides, naked; he found, however, not the &s;malle&s;t appearance of any kind of mineral. The &s;tones every where re&s;embling tho&s;e of Madeira, gave ma|nife&s;t &s;igns of having been burnt. Scarce a &s;ingle &s;tone was found during their whole &s;tay upon the i&s;land, which had not unque&s;tionable marks of fire on it, except the hatchet-&s;tone, and &s;ome of the&s;e were not entirely free from it. There are al&s;o evident traces of fire in the clay upon the hills, both of this and the neigh|bouring i&s;lands.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks was engaged the 4th in planting on each &s;ide of the fort a great quantity of the &s;eeds of water-melons, oranges, lemons, limes, and other plants and trees which he had brought from Rio de Janeiro. He gave of the&s;e &s;eeds to the Indians in great plenty, and planted many of them in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oods: &s;ome of the melon-&s;eeds, which had been planted &s;oon after his ar|rival, had already produced plants which ap|peared to be in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="275">They now began to make preparations for their departure; but before they &s;et &s;ail they had another vi&s;it from Oamo, Oberea, and their &s;on and daughter. The young woman, who&s;e name they under&s;tood to be <HI>Toimata,</HI> was very curious to &s;ee the fort, but Oamo would by no means permit her to come in. The &s;on of Waheatua, &s;overeign of Tiarrabou, or the &s;outh-ea&s;t penin&s;ula, was al&s;o here at this time; and they received intelligence of the ar|rival of another gue&s;t, who&s;e company they neither wi&s;hed for nor expected; this was the Indian who had &s;tolen the quadrant.</P>
<P>On Friday the 7th, the carpenters were or|dered to take down the gates and palli&s;adoes of the fort, to be converted into firewood on board the Endeavour; and one of the Indians &s;tole the &s;taple and hook belonging to the gate: he was in&s;tantly pur&s;ued; but could not be found; and &s;oon after this, their old friend Tubora Tumaida brought back the &s;taple.</P>
<P>They continued on the 8th and 9th to pull down the fort, and their friends &s;till vi&s;ited them.</P>
<P>Captain Cook hoped now to quit the i&s;land, without any farther mi&s;under&s;tanding with the natives; but in this he was mi&s;taken. Two foreign &s;ailors having been out, one of them was robbed of his knife, and &s;triving to reco|ver it, the Indians attacked and wounded him in a dangerous manner with a &s;tone; his com|panion al&s;o received a &s;light wound in the head.
<PB N="262" REF="276">
As Captain Cook would have been unwilling to have taken farther notice of the tran&s;action, he was not &s;orry that the offenders had made their e&s;cape. Another affair equally di&s;agreea|ble &s;oon after happened. Between the 8th and 9th in the evening; two young marines retired &s;ecretly from the fort, and in the morning were not to be met with. Notice having been given for all the company to go on board the next day, and that the &s;hip would &s;ail that day or the day en&s;uing, Captain Cook began to fear that the marines intended to remain on &s;hore. He was appri&s;ed, that no effectual &s;teps could be taken to recover them, without ri&s;king the harmony and good fellow&s;hip which at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Engli&s;h and the natives; and therefore re&s;olved to wait a day in hopes of their returning.</P>
<P>The 10th in the morning the marines not being returned, an enquiry was made after them, when the Indians declared they did not propo&s;e returning, having taken refuge in the moun|tains, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover them, and that each had taken a wife. In con&s;equence of which it was intimated to &s;everal of the Chiefs who were in the fort with their women, among whom were Tubora Tumaida, Tomio and Oberea, that they would not be &s;uffered to quit it till the de&s;erters were produced. Captain Cook thought this precaution nece&s;&s;ary, as, by concealing them a &s;hort time, he might be com|pelled
<PB N="263" REF="277">
to go without them; they received the intimation with very little &s;igns either of fear or di&s;content, a&s;&s;uring the Captain that the ma|rines &s;hould be &s;ent back. In the interim he &s;ent Mr. Hicks in the pinnace to bring Toota|hah on board the &s;hip, which he executed with|out giving any alarm. Night coming on, Captain Cook judged it was not prudent to let the people, whom he had detained as ho&s;tages, remain at the fort, and he therefore ordered Tubora Tumaida, Oberea, and &s;ome others, to be brought on board. This gave an unu&s;ual alarm, and &s;everal of them, e&s;pecially the fe|males, te&s;tified their apprehen&s;ions with great agitation of mind, and floods of tears, when they were coming on board. Captain Cook went on board with them, Mr. Banks remain|ing on &s;hore with &s;ome others, whom he thought it of le&s;s importance to detain.</P>
<P>One of the marines was brought back in the evening by &s;ome of the Indians, who reported, that the other, and the two people who were &s;ent to fetch them back, would be detained whil&s;t Tootahah was confined. Mr. Hicks was immediately di&s;patched in the long-boat, with &s;everal men, to re&s;cue the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners; at the &s;ame time Captain Cook told Tootahah, that it was incumbent on him to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with &s;ome of his people, and to give orders, in his name, that the men &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, for that he &s;hould expect him to an&s;wer for the
<PB N="264" REF="278">
event. Tootahah immediately complied, and this party recovered the men without any oppo|&s;ition. About &s;even in the morning on the 11th they returned, but without the arms which had been taken from them when they were made pri&s;oners: the arms were however brought on board &s;oon after, and the Chiefs were allowed to return on &s;hore.</P>
<P>At the time the Chiefs were &s;et on &s;hore from the &s;hip, tho&s;e at the fort were al&s;o relea&s;ed, and after remaining with Mr. Banks about an hour and a half, they all returned to their re|&s;pective places of re&s;idence. When the de|&s;erters were examined, it was di&s;covered, that the account which the Indians had given was no way fal&s;e: they had become fond of two girls, and it was their de&s;ign to keep them&s;elves concealed till the &s;hip had &s;et &s;ail, and continue upon the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Tupia, who&s;e name has been often mention|ed in this voyage, had been prime mini&s;ter of Oberea, when &s;he was at the pinnacle of her authority: he was al&s;o the principal prie&s;t of the i&s;land, and therefore intimately acquainted with the religion of the country. He was like|wi&s;e deeply ver&s;ed in navigation, and was tho|roughly acquainted with the number, &s;ituation, inhabitants and produce of the adjacent i&s;lands. He had often te&s;tified a de&s;ire to go with them; and on Wedne&s;day the 12th, in the morning, he came on board, with a boy about twelve
<PB N="265" REF="279">
years of age, his &s;ervant, named Taiyota, and reque&s;ted the gentlemen on board, to let him go with them. As it was thought he would be u&s;eful to them in many particulars, they unanimou&s;ly agreed to comply with his reque&s;t. Tupia then went a&s;hore for the la&s;t time to &s;ee his friends, and took with him &s;everal bau|bles to give them as parting tokens of remem|brance.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks being willing to obtain a drawing of the Morai, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tootahah, at Eparre, Captain Cook accompanied him thither in the pinnace, together with Dr. Solander. They immediately, upon landing, repaired to Tootahah's hou&s;e, where they were met by Oberea, and &s;everal others. A general good under&s;tanding prevailed, and they promi&s;ed to vi&s;it the gentlemen early the next day, to take leave of them, as they were told that the &s;hip would then &s;et &s;ail. There al&s;o they met Tupia, who came back with them, and &s;lept for the fir&s;t time on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 13th of July, the &s;hip was vi|&s;ited by a multitude of the gentlemen's friends, and &s;urrounded by numberle&s;s canoes, which contained the inferior natives. They weighed anchor about twelve, and the Indians took their leaves of the gentlemen on board, weeping in a friendly and affecting manner. Tupia &s;up|ported him&s;elf in this &s;cene with a becoming fortitude, tears flowed from his eyes, its true,

but the effort that he made to conceal them did him additional honour. He went with Mr. Banks to the ma&s;t head, where he continued waving his hand to the canoes as long as they re|mained vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The longitude of Port Royal Bay, as &s;ettled by Captain Wallis, was found to be within half a degree of its real &s;ituation. Point Venus, the northern extremity of the i&s;land, and the ea&s;tern point of the bay, lies in the longitude 149 degrees 30 minutes. Port Royal Bay, which is equal to any in Otaheite, may ea&s;ily be di&s;covered by a remarkable high mountain in the center of the i&s;land, bearing due &s;outh from Point Venus. The &s;hore of the bay is a fine &s;andy beach, behind which runs a river of fre&s;h water; any number of &s;hips may water here without any inconvenience to each other. The only wood for firing, upon the whole i&s;land, is that of fruit-trees, which mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed of the natives, or it is impo&s;&s;ible to live upon good terms with them.</P>
<P>According to Tupia's account, the i&s;land could furni&s;h above &s;ix thou&s;and fighting men, whereby a computation of the number of in|habitants may ea&s;ily be made.</P>
<P>The produce of Otaheite is bread-fruit, co|coa-nuts, bananas, plantains; a fruit not un|like an apple, potatoes, yams, cocoas, &s;ugar|cane, and a variety of other fruits and vege|tables.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="281">They have no European fruits, garden &s;tuff, or pul&s;e, nor grain of any &s;pecies. Their tame animals are hogs, dogs, and poultry; there is not a wild animal in the i&s;land, except ducks, pigeons, parroquets, and a few other birds; rats being the only quadruped, and there are no &s;erpents. The &s;ea however &s;upplies them with great variety of excellent fi&s;h.</P>
<P>With regard to the people, they are in gene|ral rather of a larger make than Europeans. The males are tall, robu&s;t, and finely &s;haped. The females of the &s;uperior cla&s;s are likewi&s;e generally above our common &s;ize; but tho&s;e of the lower rank are rather below it, and &s;ome of them are remarkably little.</P>
<P>Their natural complexion is a fine clear olive, or what we call <HI>brunette,</HI> their &s;kin is delicate|ly &s;mooth and agreeably &s;oft. The &s;hape of their faces is in general hand&s;ome, and their eyes are full of &s;en&s;ibility and expre&s;&s;ion, their teeth are likewi&s;e remarkably white and regu|lar, and their breath intirely free from any di&s;|agreeable &s;mell; their hair is for the mo&s;t part black. The men, unlike the original inhabi|tants of America, have long beards, which they wear in various forms; and what is very remarkable, circumci&s;ion is almo&s;t univer&s;ally practi&s;ed among them, from a motive of clean|line&s;s; having a peculiar term of reproach, with which they upbraid tho&s;e who do not adopt this cu&s;tom. Both &s;exes always eradicate the
<PB N="268" REF="282">
hair from their arm-pits, and they often re|proached the Engli&s;h gentlemen with a want of cleanline&s;s, for not making u&s;e of the &s;ame method. Their motions are ea&s;y and graceful, but not vigorous; their deportment is generous and open, and their behaviour affable and courteous. They appeared of a brave, noble, and candid di&s;po&s;ition; equally &s;trangers to the ba&s;e and unworthy pa&s;&s;ions of cruelty, trea|chery, or revenge, and &s;etting a&s;ide their vio|lent prepen&s;ity to thieving, it may fairly be &s;aid, that their general characters would lo&s;e nothing in the compari&s;on with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t civilized nation under the globe.</P>
<P>Contrary to the cu&s;tom of almo&s;t all other countries, the women of this i&s;land cut their hair quite &s;hort, whereas the men wear it long, &s;ometimes hanging loo&s;e on their &s;houlders, and at others tied in a knot on the crown of their heads, in which they &s;tick the feathers of birds of various colours.</P>
<P>Both &s;exes frequently wear a piece of cloth of the manufacture of the i&s;land tied round their heads in the form of a turban; and the women take no little pains in plaiting human hair into long &s;trings, which being folded into branches, are tied on their foreheads by way of ornament.</P>

<P>They &s;tain their bodies, by indenting or pricking the fle&s;h with a &s;mall in&s;trument made of bone, cut into &s;hort teeth; which indentures they fill with a dark blue or blacki&s;h mixture, prepared from the &s;moke or an oily nut, burnt by them in&s;tead of candles and water; this operation, which is called by the natives Tat|taowing, is exceedingly painful, and leaves an indelible mark on the &s;kin. It is u&s;ually per|formed when they are about ten or twelve years of age, and on different parts of the body; but tho&s;e which &s;uffer mo&s;t &s;everely are the breech and the loins, which are marked with arches, carried one above another a con&s;iderable way up their backs.</P>
<P>At the operation of <HI>Tattaowing,</HI> performed upon the po&s;teriors of a girl about twelve years of age, Mr. Banks was pre&s;ent, it was ex|ecuted with an in&s;trument that had twenty teeth, and at each &s;troke, which was repeated every moment, &s;erum mixed with blood i&s;&s;ued. She bore it with great re&s;olution for &s;everal mi|nutes; but at length the pain became &s;o vio|lent,
<PB N="270" REF="284">
that &s;he murmured and complained, and then bur&s;t into the mo&s;t violent lamentations; but her operator was inexorable, whil&s;t &s;ome females pre&s;ent chid, and even beat her. Mr. Banks was a &s;pectator for near an hour, during which time it was performed only on one &s;ide, the other having undergone the ceremony &s;ome|time before; and the arches upon the loins, which are the mo&s;t painful, but upon which they the mo&s;t pique them&s;elves, were yet to be made.</P>
<P>They cloath them&s;elves in cloth and matting of various kinds; the fir&s;t they wear in fair, the latter in wet weather. They are in differ|ent forms, no &s;hape being pre&s;erved in them, nor are the pieces &s;ewed together. The women of a &s;uperior cla&s;s wear three or four pieces; one, which is of con&s;iderable length, they wrap &s;everal times round their wai&s;ts, and it falls down to the middle of the leg. Two or three other &s;hort pieces, with a hole cut in the mid|dle of each, are placed on one another, and their heads coming through the holes, the long ends hang before and behind, both &s;ides being open, by which means they have the free u&s;e of their arms.</P>
<P>The mens dre&s;s is very &s;imilar, differing only in one in&s;tance, which is that part of the garment in|&s;tead of falling below the knees, is brought be|tween the legs. This dre&s;s is worn by all ranks of people, the only di&s;tinction being quantity in

the &s;uperior cla&s;s. At noon both &s;exes appear almo&s;t naked, wearing only the piece of cloth that is tied round the wai&s;t. Their faces are &s;haded from the &s;un with &s;mall bonnets, made of cocoa-nut leaves or matting which are con|&s;tructed in a few minutes. The men &s;ome|times wear a &s;ort of wig, made of human or dogs hair, or of cocoa-nut &s;trings, woven on a &s;ingle thread, which is fa&s;tened under their hair, and hangs down behind. Both men and women wear ear-rings on one &s;ide, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hells, &s;tones, berries, or &s;mall pearls; but they &s;oon gave the perference to the beads, brought by the Endeavour's company.</P>
<P>The boys and girls go quite naked; the fir&s;t till they are &s;even or eight years old; the latter till they are about five. Their hou&s;es, which have been de&s;cribed already, they &s;eldom u&s;e but to &s;leep in, or to avoid the rain, as they eat in the open air, under the &s;hade of a tree. Their clothes &s;erve them at night for covering, and there are no divi&s;ions or apartments. The ma&s;ter and his wife repo&s;e in the middle, then the married people; next to the&s;e the unmar|ried females, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance the men who are unmarried; and the &s;ervants &s;leep in the open air in fair weather. The hou&s;es of the Chiefs, however, differ in &s;ome degree; there are &s;ome very &s;mall, and &s;o built as to be car|ried in canoes: all &s;ides of them are inclo&s;ed with the leaves of the cocoa-nut; the air, ne|verthele&s;s,
<PB N="272" REF="287">
penetrates, in the&s;e the Chief and his wife alone &s;leep. There are al&s;o hou&s;es which are general receptacles for the inhabitants of a di&s;trict. The&s;e are much larger, many being more than two hundred feet in length, forty in breadth, and &s;eventy or eighty feet high. They are con&s;tructed at the common expence, and have an area on one &s;ide &s;urrounded with low palli&s;ades; but like the others have no walls.</P>
<P>When a Chief kills a hog, which is but &s;el|dom, he divides it equally among his va&s;&s;als; dogs and fowls are more common.</P>
<P>When the bread-fruit in not in &s;ea&s;on, they are &s;upplied by cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Their cookery con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of baking, the manner of doing which has been already de&s;|cribed. They bake their bread-fruit in the &s;ame way, which renders it &s;omething like a mealy potatoe; of this fruit three di&s;hes are made, by beating it to a pa&s;te, and mixing it with bana|nas, plantains, or the &s;our pa&s;te, which the natives nominate <HI>Mahie.</HI></P>
<P>This pa&s;te is made by taking bread-fruit, which is not thoroughly ripe, and laying it in heaps, covered with leaves, by which means it ferments, the core is then taken out, and the fruit put into a hole lined with gra&s;s; it is then again covered with leaves, upon which large &s;tones are placed; this produces a &s;econd fer|mentation, after which it grows &s;our, and un|dergoes
<PB N="273" REF="288">
no change for a long time; they take it from this hole as they have occa&s;ion for it, and making it into balls, it is rolled up in plan|tain-leaves and baked; as it will keep for &s;ome weeks after it is dre&s;&s;ed, they eat it both hot and cold.</P>
<P>Such is the food of the&s;e people, their &s;auce to which never con&s;i&s;ts of any thing but &s;alt water. As to their drink, it is generally con|fined to water, or the milk of the cocoa nuts, though there were in&s;tances in which &s;ome of them drank &s;o freely of the Engli&s;h liquors, as to become quite intoxicated; this, however, &s;eemed to proceed more from ignorance than de&s;ign, as they were never known to repeat a debauch of this kind a &s;econd time. They were told indeed that the Chiefs &s;ometimes be|came inebriated by drinking the juice of a plant called <HI>Ava,</HI> but of this they &s;aw no in&s;tance during the time they remained on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Chiefs generally eat alone, unle&s;s when vi&s;ited by a &s;tranger, who is &s;ometimes per|mitted to become a &s;econd in their me&s;s; hav|ing nothing to &s;upply the want of a table, they &s;it on the ground in the &s;hade; leaves of trees being &s;pread before them &s;erve as a table-cloth; their attendants, who are numerous, having placed a ba&s;ket by the Chiefs, containing their provi&s;ions, and a cocoa-nut &s;hell of fre&s;h and &s;alt water, &s;eat them&s;elves round them; they then begin by wa&s;hing their mouth and hands, after
<PB N="274" REF="289">
which they eat a mouthful of bread-fruit and fi&s;h, dipt in &s;alt water alternately, till the whole is con&s;umed, taking a &s;up of &s;alt water likewi&s;e between almo&s;t every mor&s;el. The bread-fruit and fi&s;h being all eaten, they next have either plantains or apples, which they never eat with|out being pared. During this time a &s;oft pa&s;te is prepared from the bread-fruit, which they &s;up out of a cocoa-nut &s;hell; this fini&s;hes the meal, and the hands and mouth are again wa&s;h|ed as at the beginning.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing how much food they eat at a meal; Mr. Banks and &s;ome other gentlemen were pre&s;ent when one man devoured three fi&s;h the &s;ize of a middling carp, four bread fruits as large as a common melon, thirteen or fourteen plantains &s;even or eight inches long, and above half as big round, and about a quart of the pa&s;te made of bread-fruit.</P>
<P>It is not a little &s;urprizing, that the inhabi|tants of this i&s;land, who &s;eemed exceedingly &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, &s;hould have an univer&s;al aver&s;ion to the lea&s;t intercour&s;e with each other at their meals, and &s;o rigid are they in the ob&s;ervance of this unu&s;ual cu&s;tom, that even brothers and &s;i&s;ters have their &s;eparate ba&s;kets to contain their provi&s;ions, and gene|rally &s;it &s;ome yards di&s;tance when they eat, with their backs turned towards each other, not ex|changing a &s;ingle word during the whole time of their repa&s;t; the middle aged of &s;uperior

rank u&s;ually betake them&s;elves to &s;leep after dinner, but what is remarkable, the older peo|ple are not &s;o lazy; mu&s;ic, dancing, wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting with the bow, or throwing a lance, con&s;titute a chief part part of their diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>Flutes which have been mentioned before, and drums, are the only mu&s;ical in&s;truments among them; their drums are formed of a cir|cular piece of wood, hollow at one end only, which is covered with the &s;kin of a &s;hark, and they are beaten with the hand in&s;tead of a &s;tick. Their &s;ongs are extempore, and frequently in rhime, but con&s;i&s;t of only two lines; the&s;e couplets are often &s;ung by way of evening amu&s;ements, between &s;un-&s;et and bed-time, during which time they are not de&s;titute of lights, having candles which they make of an oily nut, fixing them one above another, upon a &s;mall &s;tick run through the middle; &s;ome of the&s;e candles burn a long time, and afford a pretty good light.</P>
<P>Among their other amu&s;ements, they have a dance named <HI>Timorodee,</HI> which is performed by ten or a dozen young females, who put them&s;elves into the mo&s;t wanton attitudes that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined, keeping time during the performance with the greate&s;t nicety and ex|actne&s;s, from the&s;e dances the women are imme|diately excluded on their becoming pregnant.</P>
<P>Many of the principal people of this i&s;land, of each &s;ex, have united into an a&s;&s;ociation, in which no woman confines her favours to any
<PB N="276" REF="291">
particular man; in this manner they obtain a perpetual variety, no one object ever gratifying them but a few days.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ocieties are named <HI>Arreoy,</HI> the mem|bers of which have meetings where the men amu&s;e them&s;elves by wre&s;tling; and notwith|&s;tanding the frequent intercour&s;e which the wo|men have with a variety of men, they dance the <HI>Timorodee</HI> in &s;uch a manner, as they ima|gine will mo&s;t excite the de&s;ires of the male &s;ex, and which are often gratified upon the &s;pot. There are yet much wor&s;e practices. In ca&s;e any of the women prove with child, which in this manner of life &s;eldom happens, they de&s;troy the helple&s;s infant as &s;oon as it is brought into the world, that it may not be a burden to the fa|ther, nor interrupt the mother in the pur&s;uit of her la&s;civious amu&s;ements. Natural affection, however, for the child &s;ometimes happily pro|duces a reformation in the mother, but when this happens, the child's life is always forfeited, unle&s;s the mother can procure a man to adopt it as his child, in which ca&s;e this inhuman mur|der is prevented, but both the man and woman are for ever expelled this &s;ociety. The woman being particularized by the appellation of <HI>Whannownow,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"bearer of children"</Q>, which among the&s;e people, is con&s;idered as a term of the greate&s;t reproach.</P>
<P>Their per&s;onal cleanline&s;s is an object that merits peculiar attention. Both &s;exes never
<PB N="277" REF="292">
omit to wa&s;h with water three times a day; when they ri&s;e, at noon, and before they go to re&s;t. They al&s;o keep their cloaths extremely clean; &s;o that in the large&s;t communities no di&s;agreeable effluvia ever ari&s;es, nor is there any other inconvenience than heat.</P>
<P>The chief manufacture of Otaheite is cloth; of this cloth there are three different &s;orts, which are made of the bark of as many differ|ent trees, viz. the mulberry, the bread-fruit, and a tree not very unlike the wild fig-tree, which is found in &s;ome parts of the We&s;t Indies. The mulberry-tree, which the Indians call <HI>Aouta,</HI> produces the fine&s;t cloth, which is &s;eldom worn but by tho&s;e of the fir&s;t rank. The next &s;ort, which is worn by the lower cla&s;s of people, is made of the bread-fruit tree, and the coar&s;e&s;t of the tree re&s;embling the fig-tree. This la&s;t &s;ort, though more u&s;eful than the two former on account of its keeping cut water, which neither of the others will, is exceedingly &s;carce, being manufactured but in &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method is u&s;ed in manufacturing the&s;e three cloths, notwith&s;tanding they are all different; a de&s;cription therefore of their man|ner of making one, will &s;uffice for the whole.</P>
<P>Having &s;tript off the bark of the trees, it is &s;oaked in water for two or three days, they then take it out and &s;eparate the inner bark from the external coat, by &s;craping it with a &s;hell, after which it is &s;pread out on plantain-leaves, plac|ing
<PB N="278" REF="293">
two or three layers one over another, and taking care to make it of an equal thickne&s;s in every part; it continues in this &s;tate till it is nearly dry, when it adheres together &s;o firmly, that it may be taken from the ground without breaking. After this proce&s;s it is laid on a &s;mooth board, and beaten with an in&s;trument made for that purpo&s;e, of a compact heavy wood, called by the natives <HI>Etoa.</HI> This in&s;tru|ment is about fourteen inches long, and &s;even in circumference; it is of a quadrangular &s;hape, and each of the four &s;ides is marked with lon|gitudinal grooves or furrows, differing in this in&s;tance, that there is a regular gradation in the width and depth of the grooves on each of the &s;ides, the coar&s;er &s;ide containing not more than ten of the&s;e furrows, and the fine&s;t above &s;ixty.</P>
<P>They begin to beat their cloth with that &s;ide of the mallet where the grooves are deepe&s;t and wide&s;t, and proceeding regularly with the others, fini&s;h with that which has the greate&s;t number; by this beating it is extended in a manner &s;imilar to the gold which is formed into leaves by the hammer, and is marked with an appearance of little channels, not unlike tho&s;e which are vi&s;ible on paper, but rather deeper; it is in general beat very thin, and when they want it thicker than common, they take two or three pieces and pa&s;te them toge|ther with a kind of glue, prepared from a root called <HI>Pea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="294">This cloth becomes exceedingly white by bleaching, and is died of a red, yellow, brown, or black colour: the fir&s;t of which is exceed|ingly beautiful, and equal, if not &s;uperior, to any in Europe. They make this red colour from a mixture of the juices of two vegetables, neither of which u&s;ed &s;eparately has this effect.</P>
<P>Matting of various kinds is another con&s;ider|able manufacture, in which they excel, in ma|ny re&s;pects, the Europeans. They make u&s;e of the coar&s;er &s;ort to &s;leep on, and in wet wea|ther they wear the finer.</P>
<P>They greatly excel in the ba&s;ket and wicker|work; both men and women employ them&s;elves at it, and can make it of a great number of dif|ferent patterns.</P>
<P>They make ropes and lines of all &s;izes of the bark of the <HI>poerou,</HI> and their nets for fi&s;hing are made of the&s;e lines: the fibres of the co|coa-nut they make thread of, &s;uch as they u&s;e to fa&s;ten together the &s;everal parts of their ca|noes; the forms of which are various, accord|ing to the u&s;e to which they are applied.</P>
<P>Their fi&s;hing-lines are e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the world, made of the bark of the <HI>Erowa,</HI> a kind of nettle which grows on the mountains; they are &s;trong enough to hold the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t vigorous fi&s;h, &s;uch as bonetas and albicores; in &s;hort, they are extremely ingenious in every expedient for taking all kinds of fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="295">The tools which the&s;e people make u&s;e of for building hou&s;es, con&s;tructing canoes, hew|ing &s;tone, and for felling, cleaving, carving and poli&s;hing timber, con&s;i&s;t of nothing more than an adze of &s;tone, and a chi&s;&s;el of bone, mo&s;t commonly that of a man's arm; and for a file or poli&s;her, they make u&s;e of a ra&s;p of coral, and coral &s;and.</P>
<P>The blades of their adzes are extremely tough, but not very hard; they make them of various &s;izes, tho&s;e for felling weigh &s;ix or &s;even pounds; and others which are u&s;ed for carving, only a few ounces; they are obliged, every minute, to &s;harpen them on a &s;tone, which is always kept near them for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t difficult ta&s;k they meet with in the u&s;e of the&s;e tools, is the felling of a tree, which employs a great number of hands for &s;e|veral days together.</P>
<P>The tree which is in general u&s;e is called <HI>Avie,</HI> the &s;tem of which is &s;trait and tall. Some of their &s;maller boats are made of the bread-fruit tree, which is wrought without much dif|ficulty, being of a light &s;pongy nature. In|&s;tead of planes, they u&s;e their adzes with great dexterity. Their canoes are all &s;haped with the hand, the Indians not being acquainted with the method of warping a plank.</P>
<P>They have two kinds of canoes, one they call <HI>Ivahahs,</HI> the other <HI>Pahies</HI>; the former is u&s;ed for &s;hort voyages at &s;ea, and the latter for
<PB N="281" REF="296">
longer ones. The&s;e boats do not differ either in &s;hape or &s;ize; but they are in no degree pro|portionate, being from &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet to ten in length, and not more than the thirtieth part in breadth. Some are employed in going from one i&s;land to another, and others u&s;ed for fi&s;hing. There is al&s;o the Ivahah, which &s;erves for fighting; the&s;e are by far the longe&s;t, and the head and &s;tern are con&s;iderably rai&s;ed above the body. The&s;e Ivahahs are fa&s;tened together, &s;ide by &s;ide when they go to &s;ea, at the di&s;tance of a few feet, by &s;trong wooden poles, which are laid acro&s;s them and joined to each &s;ide. A &s;tage or platform is rai&s;ed on the fore-part about ten or twelve feet long; upon which &s;tand the fighting men, who&s;e mi&s;&s;ile weapons are &s;lings and &s;pears. Beneath the&s;e &s;tages the rowers &s;it, who &s;upply the place of tho&s;e who are wounded.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hing Ivahahs are from thirty or forty to ten feet in length; and tho&s;e for travelling have a &s;mall hou&s;e fixed on board, which is fa&s;|tened upon the fore-part, for the better accom|modation of per&s;ons of rank, who occupy them both day and night.</P>
<P>The Pahies differ al&s;o in &s;ize, being from &s;ix|ty to &s;eventy feet long, they are likewi&s;e very narrow, and are &s;ometimes u&s;ed for fighting, but chiefly for long voyages. In going from one i&s;land to another, they &s;ometimes are out a month, and often at &s;ea a fortnight or twenty
<PB N="282" REF="297">
days, and if they had convenience to &s;tow more provi&s;ions, they could &s;tay out much longer.</P>
<P>The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are very u&s;eful in landing, and putting off from the &s;hore in a &s;urf; for by their great length and high &s;terns they landed dry, when the Endeavour's boats could &s;carcely land at all.</P>
<P>They are very curious in the con&s;truction of the&s;e boats, the chief parts or pieces whereof are formed &s;eparately without either &s;aw, plane, chi&s;&s;el, or any other iron tool, which renders their fabrication more &s;urprizing and worthy ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The&s;e parts being prepared, the keel is fixed upon blocks, and the planks are &s;upported with props, till they are &s;ewed or joined together with &s;trong plaited thongs, which are pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times through holes bored with a chi&s;&s;el of bone, &s;uch as they u&s;ually make u&s;e of; and when fini&s;hed, they are &s;ufficiently tight with|out caulking.</P>
<P>They keep the&s;e boats with great care in a kind of &s;hed, built on purpo&s;e to contain them.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were at a lo&s;s to find out their method of dividing time; they always made u&s;e of the term <HI>Malama,</HI> which &s;ignifies moon, whenever they &s;poke of time, either pa&s;t or to come; they reckon thirteen of the&s;e moons, beginning again when they are expired. This proves that they have &s;ome idea of the &s;olar year; but the&s;e gentlemen could
<PB N="283" REF="298">
not di&s;cover how they computed their months, &s;o as to make thirteen of them equal to the year; for the natives &s;ay, that their month con|&s;i&s;ts of twenty-nine days, one day, in which the moon is invi&s;ible, being included. They knew the fruits that would be in &s;ea&s;on, and even the prevailing weather of the months to come.</P>
<P>They divide the day into twelve parts, each con&s;i&s;ting of two hours, &s;ix belonging to the day, and the other &s;ix to the night. They reckon from one to ten when they numerate, making u&s;e of their fingers, and changing hands till they come to the number which they intend to expre&s;s, and in conver&s;ation they joined &s;igns to their words, which were remarkably expre&s;&s;ive of their meaning.</P>
<P>They are not &s;o expert in mea&s;uring di&s;tances, as in computing numbers; for when they &s;peak of the di&s;tance from one place to another, they are obliged to expre&s;s it by the time that would be taken to pa&s;s it.</P>
<P>Their language is &s;oft and mu&s;ical, abounds with vowels, and is ea&s;y to be pronounced. But whether it is copious, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were not &s;ufficiently acquainted with it to know. As very few either of their nouns or verbs are declinable, it mu&s;t con&s;equently be very imperfect. They found means, however, to be mutually under&s;tood without much dif|ficulty.</P>

<P><PB N="285" REF="300">In re&s;pect to di&s;ea&s;es, the natives are &s;eldom afflicted with any, except &s;ometimes an acciden|tal fit of the cholic. They are &s;ubject to the eri&s;ypelas, attended with cutaneous eruptions, not unlike the lepro&s;y; and if they have had it for any time to a certain degree, they are &s;e|cluded from all &s;ociety, and live alone in a &s;mall hou&s;e, in &s;ome unfrequented part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Here the management of the &s;ick falls to the lot of the prie&s;ts, and their method of cure con|&s;i&s;ts chiefly of prayers and ceremonies, which are repeated till the patients recover or die. If they recover, they attribute the cure to the&s;e re|medies; if they die, like the medical tribe of this and every other country, they &s;ay the di&s;|ea&s;e was incurable.</P>
<P>From their connection with the Europeans, they have entailed upon them&s;elves that dread|ful cur&s;e, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e; which, upon en|quiry, evidently appeared to have been brought among them by the ve&s;&s;els under the command of Mon&s;. Bougainville. It was called by a name &s;omewhat &s;imilar, in meaning, to <HI>rotten|ne&s;s,</HI> but of a much &s;tronger import; and they gave a mo&s;t &s;hocking account of the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e who were fir&s;t infected with it; telling them, that their nails and hair fell off, and the fle&s;h even rotted from their bones: and &s;o greatly were they terrified at the dreadful effects of this alarming di&s;ea&s;e, that the infected per&s;on was for&s;aken even by his own relations, and left to
<PB N="286" REF="301">
peri&s;h by him&s;elf, in &s;uch a &s;tate of mi&s;ery and pain as he had never before experienced.</P>
<P>The religion of the&s;e people appeared to be exceedingly my&s;terious; and as the language u&s;ed on the occa&s;ion was different from that &s;poken in common, they were not able to ob|tain much information re&s;pecting it, but from what little they could learn from their friend Tupia, the&s;e Indians &s;eemed to have adopted &s;trange notions of the creation of the world; imagining that every thing was derived from procreation, and the conjunction of two per|&s;ons. The &s;upreme Deity, one of the&s;e two fir&s;t Beings, they call TAROATAIHETOOMOO; and the other, TEPAPA. The year which is call|ed TETTOWMATATAYO, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the daughter of the two fir&s;t. They al&s;o imagine, that there is an inferior race of Deities, whom they call EATUAS. They &s;ay, two of the&s;e Ea|tuas formerly inhabited the earth, and that the fir&s;t man de&s;cended from them.</P>
<P>They emphatically &s;tile the &s;upreme Being, the <HI>Cau&s;er of Earthquakes</HI>; but their prayers are more generally addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Tane,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;on of the fir&s;t progenitors of nature.</P>
<P>They believe in the exi&s;tence of the &s;oul in a &s;eparate &s;tate, and that there are two &s;ituations, differing in their degrees of happine&s;s, which they con&s;ider as receptacles for different ranks, but not as places of reward and puni&s;hment; they &s;uppo&s;e, that their Chiefs and principal

people will have the preference to tho&s;e of in|ferior rank, as they imagine their actions no way influence their future &s;tate, and that their Deities take no cognizance of them what&s;oever.</P>
<P>The office of prie&s;t is hereditary; there are &s;everal of them, and of all ranks; the Chief is re&s;pected next to their Kings, and they are &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the natives not only in point of divine knowledge, but al&s;o in that of navigation and a&s;tronomy.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts here are no way concerned with the ceremony of marriage, it being a &s;imple a|greement between the man and woman; and when they chu&s;e to &s;eparate, it is done with as little ceremony as that of their marriage.</P>
<P>The&s;e people do not &s;eem to be any way guil|ty of idolatry, as they wor&s;hip no kind of images whatever. They enter their morais with great reverence and humility, and when they bring their offering to the altar, their body is uncovered to the wai&s;t.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ubordination among them, that much re&s;embles the early &s;tate of every nation in Europe under the feudal &s;y&s;tem, which &s;e|cured, to a &s;mall number, the mo&s;t unre&s;train|ed liberty, while the re&s;t were abject &s;laves.</P>
<P>Their ranks or orders are, <HI>Earee rahie,</HI> which &s;ignifies King; <HI>Earee,</HI> Baron; <HI>Manahouni,</HI> Va&s;|&s;al; and <HI>Toutou,</HI> Villain. The Earee rahie, of which there are two, one belonging to each of the penin&s;ulas of which this i&s;land con&s;i&s;ts, had
<PB N="288" REF="304">
great re&s;pect &s;hewn them by all ranks. The Earees are Lords of one or more of the di&s;tricts, into which each of the penin&s;ulas is divided; and they &s;eparate their territories into lots, which are given to the <HI>Manahounies,</HI> who re&s;pectively cultivate that &s;hare which they hold under the baron. But they are only nominal cultivators, this as well as all other laborious work being done by the <HI>Toutous,</HI> or lower cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>The Sovereign or Earee rahie, and the Ba|ron or Earee, are &s;ucceeded in titles and ho|nours by their children as &s;oon as they are born, the fathers being immediately dive&s;ted of them; but they remain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and managers of their e&s;tates.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e of a general attack upon the i&s;land, every di&s;trict, under the command of an Earee, furni&s;hes a proportionate number of fighting men for the defence of the common cau&s;e, and they are commanded in chief by the Earee rahie.&mdash;According to Tupia's account, the number furni&s;hed by the principal di&s;tricts amounted to &s;ix thou&s;and and upwards.</P>
<P>Slings, with which they are very dextrous, pikes headed with &s;tone, and long clubs made of wood, remarkably hard and heavy, con&s;titute their weapons. With the&s;e they fight with great ob&s;tinacy and cruelty, giving no quarter to either man, woman or child, if they fall into their hands in time of battle.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="305">During the &s;tay of the Endeavour, there was a perfect good under&s;tanding between the Earee rahies of the two penin&s;ulas, though the Earee rahie of Tiarreboo, arrogated to him&s;elf the title of King of the whole i&s;land; which the other con|&s;idered, as it really was, a mere nominal claim, and only a feather in his cap. There is nothing among them &s;ub&s;tituted for money, or a general medium, by which every object may be pur|cha&s;ed or procured; neither can any permanent good be unlawfully obtained by force or fraud; and the general commerce with women, &s;ets a&s;ide almo&s;t every excitement for committing adul|tery. In a word, in a government &s;o little po|li&s;hed, though di&s;tributive ju&s;tice cannot be re|gularly admini&s;tered; as there can at the &s;ame time be but few crimes for the exerci&s;e of it, the want of this ju&s;tice is not &s;o &s;everely felt, as it would be in more civilized &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day July the 13th, after leaving the i&s;land of Otaheite, they &s;ailed with a gentle breeze and clear weather; and were informed by Tupia, that four i&s;lands, which he called Huaheine, Ulietea, Otaha, and Bolabola, were at the di&s;tance of about one or two days &s;ail, and that hogs, fowls, and other refre&s;hments, which had lately been &s;carce, were to be got there in abundance. They accordingly &s;teered their cour&s;e in &s;earch of the&s;e i&s;lands, and on Satur|day the 15th, di&s;covered the i&s;land of Hua|heine; and on the 16th, in the morning, they
<PB N="290" REF="306">
&s;ounded near the north-we&s;t part of the i&s;land, but found no bottom with &s;eventy fathom. Several canoes immediately put off, but they appeared fearful of coming near the &s;hip, till they &s;aw Tupia, which totally removed their apprehen&s;ions, and they ventured to come along-&s;ide, and upon a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip, the King of Huaheine and his Queen went on board. A&s;toni&s;hment was te&s;tified by their Maje&s;ties at every thing that was &s;hewn them; yet they made no re&s;earches, and appeared &s;a|tisfied with what was pre&s;ented to their ob&s;er|vation, making no enquiry after any other ob|jects, though it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a building of &s;uch novelty and extent as the &s;hip mu&s;t have afforded many curio&s;ities. The King, who&s;e name was <HI>Oree,</HI> made a propo&s;al to exchange names with Captain Cook, which was readily a&s;&s;ented to. The cu&s;tom of exchang|ing names is very prevalent in this i&s;land, and is con&s;idered as a mark of friend&s;hip. They found the people here nearly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of Otaheite in almo&s;t every circum&s;tance, except, if Tupia might be credited, they were not ad|dicted to thieving. Having come to an anchor in a &s;mall but fine harbour, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, Captain Cook went a&s;hore, accom|panied by Mr. Banks and &s;ome other gentlemen, with Tupia and the King. The in&s;tant they landed, Tupia uncovered him&s;elf as low as his wai&s;t, and de&s;ired Mr. Monkhou&s;e to fol|low
<PB N="293" REF="307">
his example. Being &s;eated, he now begun a &s;peech, which la&s;ted about twenty minutes; the King, who &s;tood oppo&s;ite to him, an&s;wering in what &s;eemed to be &s;et replies. During this di&s;cour&s;e he delivered, at different times, a handkerchief, a black &s;ilk neckcloth, &s;ome beads and plantains, as pre&s;ents to their Eatua, or Deity. He received in return for the Eatua, of the Engli&s;h, a hog, &s;ome young plantains, and two bunches of feathers, which were car|ried on board. The&s;e ceremonies were con|&s;idered as a kind of ratification of a treaty be|tween the Engli&s;h and the King of Huaheine.</P>
<P>On the 17th they went again on &s;hore, and walked up into the country, the productions of which greatly re&s;embled tho&s;e of Otaheite; the rocks and clay &s;eemed, however, more burnt; the boat-hou&s;es were large, and the other hou&s;es neat. The level part of the country affords the mo&s;t beautiful land&s;capes that the imagina|tion can po&s;&s;ibly form an idea of; the &s;oil is exceedingly fertile, and the &s;hores are lined with fruit trees of different kinds, particularly the cocoa-nut, which was &s;een in great abundance.</P>
<P>They al&s;o went on &s;hore on the 18th without Tupia, but his boy, who&s;e name was Tayota, accompanied them, and Mr. Banks propo&s;ed taking a more perfect view of a kind of che&s;t, or ark, which he had before ob&s;erved; the lid of this ark was &s;ewed on in a peculiar manner, and thatched with palm-nut leaves. It was
<PB N="292" REF="308">
placed upon two poles, and &s;u&s;tained on &s;mall carved arches of wood, the poles &s;erved to re|move it from one place to another, in the man|ner of a &s;edan chair; it is very &s;urpri&s;ing, that this che&s;t was of a form greatly re&s;embling the ark of the Lord among the Jews; but what was &s;till more extraordinary, the boy informed them, that it was called <HI>Ewharre no Eatua, the hou&s;e of the God,</HI> but he could give no account of its meaning or utility: with &s;ome difficulty they negotiated for eleven pigs, and were not without hopes of obtaining more the next morning.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 19th, they carried &s;ome hatchets with them, with which they procured three very large hogs. As they propo&s;ed to &s;ail in the afternoon, the King, accompanied by &s;ome others of the natives, came on board to take his leave, when his Maje&s;ty received from Captain Cook a &s;mall pewter plate, with the following in&s;cription. <Q REND="inline">"His Britannic Ma|je&s;ty's &s;hip Endeavour, Lieutenant Cook Com|mander, 16 July, 1769."</Q> He al&s;o was pre|&s;ented with &s;ome medals, or counters, re&s;em|bling the coin of England, and a few other trifles.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is &s;ituated in the latitude of 16 degrees 43 minutes &s;outh, and longitude 150 degrees 52 minutes we&s;t; it is di&s;tant from Ota|heite about thirty leagues, and is about twenty miles in circumference.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="309">The productions of Huaheine, &s;eem to be a month forwarder than tho&s;e of Otaheite, as they found by &s;everal of the fruits, &amp;c. Mr. Banks met with only a few new plants, but found a &s;pe|cies of &s;corpion which he had not &s;een before.</P>
<P>The people are of a very lazy di&s;po&s;ition, though they are &s;touter and larger made than tho&s;e of Otaheite.</P>
<P>The women are much fairer than tho&s;e of that i&s;land, and in general exceedingly hand|&s;ome: both men and women &s;eemed le&s;s &s;u&s;|ceptible of fear, and not &s;o de&s;irous of in|formation.</P>
<P>From Huaheine they &s;ailed for the i&s;land of Ulietea, and in the afternoon came within a league or two of the &s;hore. The next morn|ing, being the 20th, by the direction of Tu|pia, they anchored in a bay, which is formed by a reef, on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land; two canoes of natives &s;oon came off from the &s;hore, and brought with them two &s;mall hogs, which they exchanged for &s;ome nails and beads. The Captain, Mr. Banks, and &s;ome other gentle|men, now went on &s;hore, accompanied by Tu|pia, who introduced them with the &s;ame kind of ceremonies that had taken place on their landing at Huaheine; after which, Capt. Cook took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this and the adjacent i&s;lands in the name of the King of Great Britain.</P>
<P>They then walked to a large Morai, which the natives called <HI>Tapodeboatea</HI>; they found that
<PB N="294" REF="310">
it differed con&s;iderably from the Morais of Ota|heite, being compo&s;ed of four walls, about eight or nine feet in height, built of very large coral-&s;tones, which &s;urrounded an area about thirty yards &s;quare: at a &s;mall di&s;tance they di&s;|covered an <HI>Ewhatta,</HI> or altar, upon which, as an oblation, was placed a whole hog, about a hundred pounds weight. At the front of this Morai, facing the &s;ea, there was a kind of am|phitheatre. There were likewi&s;e three or four <HI>Ewharee no Eatua,</HI> or hou&s;es of God, of the &s;ame kind as that which they &s;aw at Huaheine.</P>
<P>On Friday the 21&s;t, the Ma&s;ter was &s;ent in the long-boat to in&s;pect the coa&s;t on the &s;outh part of the i&s;land, and a Lieutenant was di&s;|patched in the yawl, to &s;ound the harbour where the Endeavour lay, while the Captain went in the pinnace to take a view of the coa&s;t on the north part of the i&s;land; in their return they &s;aw a tree, of the &s;ame kind as that &s;een by Mr. Green at Otaheite, the circumference of the trunk, or rather congeries of the roots of which mea&s;ured about forty yards.</P>
<P>On the 22d and 23d it being hazy weather with bri&s;k gales, Captain Cook judged it ra|ther un&s;afe to put to &s;ea. On they 24th they got under &s;ail, and &s;teered to the northward within the reef, towards an opening five or &s;ix leagues di&s;tant; in effecting this, he was in the greate&s;t danger of &s;triking on a rock; the man who &s;ounded, crying out on a &s;udden, two fa|thom,
<PB N="295" REF="311">
at which they were much alarmed, but happily got clear without receiving any damage.</P>
<P>The bay in which the Endeavour lay at an|chor is called <HI>Oopoa</HI>; it is large enough to con|tain a great number of &s;hipping, and is &s;ecured from the &s;ea by a reef of rocks. It lies off the ea&s;termo&s;t point of the i&s;land, and may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed by a low woody i&s;land which lies to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of it.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions of this i&s;land con&s;i&s;t chiefly of cocoa-nuts, yams, plantains, and a few hogs and fowls: that part of the country where they landed is not &s;o fruitful as either Otaheite or Huaheine.</P>
<P>On the 25th they were within a league or two of the i&s;land of Otaha, but the wind continuing contrary, they could not get near enough to land till the 28th in the morning, when Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went in the long-boat, with the Ma&s;ter, to &s;ound a harbour on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which they found &s;afe and convenient, with good anchorage. They then went on &s;hore, and purcha&s;ed &s;ome hogs and fowls, and a large quantity of yams and plantains.</P>
<P>This i&s;land appeared to be more barren than Ulietea, but the produce was much the &s;ame. The natives paid them the compliment they u&s;ed towards their own Kings, by uncovering their &s;houlders, and wrapping their cloaths
<PB N="296" REF="312">
round their bodies; taking care no one &s;hould omit doing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>On the 29th they made &s;ail to the northward, and at eight o'clock next morning they were clo&s;e under the high craggy peak of the i&s;land of Bolabola. The i&s;land was inacce&s;&s;ible in this part, and they found it impo&s;&s;ible to weather the &s;outh end of it till late at night. The next morning, Sunday the 30th, they di&s;covered an i&s;land, which Tupia called Maurua, who &s;aid it was &s;mall, &s;urrounded by a reef, and without any commodious harbour, but inhabited, and yielded nearly the &s;ame produce as the adjacent i&s;lands. In the middle is a high round hill, which may be &s;een at eleven or twelve leagues di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, finding them&s;elves to wind|ward of &s;ome harbours that lay on the we&s;t &s;ide of Ulietea, they intended to put into one of them, in order to &s;top a leak which they had &s;prung in the powder-room, and to take in &s;ome additional balla&s;t. The wind being right a|gain&s;t them, they plied on and off till the after|noon, of the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, when they came to an anchor in the entrance of the channel which led into one of the harbours.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day 2, in the morning, when the tide turned, they came into a proper place for moor|ing, in twenty-eight fathom. In the interim many of the natives came off, and brought
<PB N="297" REF="313">
hogs, fowls, and plantains, which were pur|cha&s;ed upon very moderate terms.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on &s;hore, and &s;pent the day very agreeably; the natives &s;hewing them great re&s;pect. Being conducted to the hou&s;es of the chief people, they were received in an uncommon manner. Upon their entrance into a hou&s;e, they found tho&s;e who had ran ha&s;tily before them, &s;tanding on each &s;ide of a long matt, &s;pread upon the ground, and the family &s;itting at the further end of it. In one hou&s;e they ob&s;erved &s;ome very young girls, dre&s;&s;ed in the neate&s;t manner, who kept their places, waiting for the &s;trangers to acco&s;t them: the&s;e girls were the mo&s;t beautiful the gentlemen had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>One of them, who was about &s;even or eight years old, was dre&s;&s;ed in a red gown, and her head was decorated with a great quantity of plaited hair; this ornament is called <HI>Tomou,</HI> and is held in great e&s;timation among them. She was &s;itting at the upper end of one of their long mats, on which none of the people pre|&s;ent pre&s;umed to &s;et a foot; and her head was reclined on the arm of a decent looking woman, who appeared to be her nur&s;e; when Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander approached her, &s;he &s;tretched out her hand to receive &s;ome beads, which they pre&s;ented to her, with an air of &s;uch dignity and gracefulne&s;s, as would have done honour to the fir&s;t prince&s;s in Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="314">Before their departure they were entertained with a dance, different from any they had &s;een before. The performer put upon his head a large piece of wicker-work, about four feet long, of a cylindrical form, covered with fea|thers, and edged round with &s;hark's teeth. Having this head-dre&s;s on, which is called a <HI>Whou,</HI> he began to dance with a &s;low motion, frequently moving his head, &s;o as to de&s;cribe a circle with the top of his wicker cap, and &s;ome|times throwing it &s;o near the faces of the bye-&s;tanders, as to make them jump back; this they con&s;idered as an excellent piece of humour, and it always produced a hearty laugh, when practiced upon any of the Engli&s;h gentlemen.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 3d, as Mr. Banks and the Doctor were going along the &s;hore to the north|ward, with a de&s;ign to purcha&s;e &s;tock, they met with a company of dancers, who retarded the progre&s;s of their excur&s;ion near two hours, and afforded them much diver&s;ion. The company was compo&s;ed of &s;ix men and two women dan|cers, with three drums. They were informed, that the&s;e dancers were &s;ome of the principal people of the i&s;land, and though they were an itinerant troop, they did not, like the &s;troll|ing parties of Otaheite, receive any gratuity from the by-&s;tanders. The women wore a con|&s;iderable quantity of Tamou, or plaited hair, ornamented with the flowers of the cape je&s;&s;a|mine, which were &s;tuck in with ta&s;te, and made

<FIGURE>

<PB N="299" REF="316">
an elegant head dre&s;s. The womens necks, brea&s;ts and arms were naked; the other parts of the body were covered with black cloth, which was fa&s;tened clo&s;e round them; and by the &s;ide of each brea&s;t, next the arms, was a &s;mall plume of black feathers, worn like a no&s;e|gay.</P>
<P>Thus apparalleled they advanced &s;ideways, keeping time with great exactne&s;s to the drums, which beat quick and loud; &s;oon after, they began to &s;hake them&s;elves in a very whim&s;ical manner, and put their bodies into a variety of &s;trange po&s;tures, &s;ometimes &s;tanding in a row one behind another, &s;ometimes &s;itting down, and at others falling with their faces to the ground, and re&s;ting on their knees and elbows, moving their fingers at the &s;ame time with a quickne&s;s &s;carcely to be credited. The chief dexterity, however, of the dancers, as well as the amu&s;ement of the &s;pectators, con&s;i&s;ted in the la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s of their attitudes and ge&s;tures, which decency forbids us to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Between the dances of the women, a kind of dramatic interlude was performed by the men, con&s;i&s;ting of dialogue as well as dancing; but for want of a &s;ufficient knowledge of their language, they could not learn the &s;ubject of this interlude.</P>
<P>Friday the 4th, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and &s;ome other gentlemen, were pre&s;ent at a more regular dramatic entertainment. The
<PB N="300" REF="317">
performers, who were all men, were divided into two parties, one dre&s;&s;ed in brown, and the other in white, by way of di&s;tinction. Tupia being pre&s;ent, informed them, that the party in brown acted the parts of a ma&s;ter and his &s;ervants, and the party in white a gang of thieves; the ma&s;ter having produced a ba&s;ket of meat, which he gave in charge to his &s;ervants; the white party exhibited a variety of expedients, in en|deavouring to &s;teal this ba&s;ket, and the brown &s;et as many in preventing the accompli&s;h|ment of their de&s;ign. After &s;ome time had been &s;pent in this manner, tho&s;e to whom the ba&s;ket was entru&s;ted, laying them&s;elves down on the ground round it, pretended to fall a&s;leep; the other party availing them&s;elves of this op|portunity, &s;tole gently upon them, and carried off their booty; the &s;ervants awaking &s;oon af|ter di&s;covered their lo&s;s, but they made no &s;earch after the ba&s;ket, and began to dance with as much alacrity as before.</P>
<P>On Saturday the 5th, &s;ome hogs and fowls, and &s;everal large pieces of cloth, many of them being fifty or &s;ixty yards in length, together with a quantity of plantains and cocoa-nuts, were &s;ent to Captain Cook as a pre&s;ent, from the Earee rahie of the i&s;land of Bolabola, ac|companied with a me&s;&s;age, that he was then on the i&s;land, and intended waiting on the Captain the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="318">On Sunday the 6th, the King of Bolabola did not vi&s;it them agreeable to his promi&s;e, his ab&s;ence, however, was not in the lea&s;t regret|ted, as he &s;ent three very agreeable young wo|men to demand &s;omething in return for his pre|&s;ent. After dinner, they &s;et out to pay the King a vi&s;it on &s;hore, as he did not think pro|per to come on board. As this man was the Earee rahie of the Bolabola men, who had conquered this, and were the dread of all the neighbouring i&s;lands, they were greatly di&s;ap|pointed, in&s;tead of finding a vigorous, enter|pri&s;ing young Chief, to &s;ee a poor feeble decre|pid old dotard, half blind, and &s;inking under the weight of age and infirmities. He received them without either that &s;tate or ceremony which they had hitherto met with among the other Chiefs.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 9th, having &s;topped their leak, and taken on board their fre&s;h &s;tock of provi&s;ions, they &s;ailed out of the harbour. Tho' they were &s;everal leagues di&s;tant from the i&s;land of Bolabola, Tupia earne&s;tly entreated Captain Cook, that a &s;hot might be fired towards it; which, to gratify him, the Captain complied with. This was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been intend|ed by Tupia as a mark of his re&s;entment again&s;t the inhabitants of that place, as they had for|merly taken from him large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which he held in the i&s;land of Ulietea, of which i&s;land
<PB N="302" REF="319">
Tupia was a native, and a &s;ubordinate Chief, but was driven out by the&s;e people.</P>
<P>They had great plenty of provi&s;ions, as well of hogs and fowls, as of vegetables, during the time they continued in the neighbourhood of tho&s;e i&s;lands, &s;o that they were not obliged to u&s;e any con&s;iderable quantity of the &s;hip's provi&s;i|ons, and they had flattered them&s;elves, that the fowls and hogs would have &s;upplied them with fre&s;h provi&s;ions during the cour&s;e of their voy|age to the &s;outhward; but in this they were un|happily di&s;appointed, for as the hogs could not be brought to eat any &s;ort of European grain, or any provender whatever that the &s;hip afforded, they were reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of killing them immediately on their leaving tho&s;e i&s;lands; and the fowls all died of a di&s;|ea&s;e in their head, with which they were &s;eized &s;oon after they had been carried on board.</P>
<P>As they were detained longer at Ulietea in re|pairing the &s;hip than they expected, they did not go on &s;hore at Bolabola; but, after giving the general name of the <HI>Society I&s;lands</HI> to the i&s;lands of Huhaheine, Ulietea, Bolabola, Ota|ha and Maurua, which lie between the la|litude of 16 deg. 10 min. and 16 deg. 55 min. &s;outh, they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e, &s;tanding &s;outh|wardly for an i&s;land, to which they were di|rected by Tupia, at above an hundred leagues di&s;tant, which they di&s;covered on Sunday the 13th, and were informed by him, that it was
<PB N="303" REF="320">
called <HI>Ohiteroa.</HI> The next morning they &s;tood in for land, and &s;aw &s;everal of the inhabitants along the &s;hore; one of the Lieutenants was now di&s;patched in the pinnace, to &s;ound for anchorage, and obtain what intelligence he could of the natives, re&s;pecting any land that might lay further to the &s;outh. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia went al&s;o in the boat, with the Lieutenant, when they came near the &s;hore, they could perceive that the inhabitants were armed with lances of a con&s;iderable length. The appearance of the boat &s;oon drew together a great number of them upon the beech, two of whom leaped into the water, and endea|voured to gain the boat, but &s;he &s;oon left them behind; &s;everal others made the &s;ame attempt, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The boat having doubled the point where they intended to land, opened a large bay, and di&s;covered another party of the natives &s;tand|ing at the end of it, armed in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e they had already &s;een. The boat's crew now rowed towards the &s;hore, and began to make preparations for landing, upon which a canoe, with &s;ome of the natives on board, came off towards them; they ordered Tupia to acquaint the&s;e people, that they did not in|tend doing them any injury, but wanted to traffick with them with nails, which they &s;hewed them; this information encouraged them to come along-&s;ide the boat, and they accepted
<PB N="304" REF="321">
of &s;ome nails, which were given them with much apparent plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction; it &s;oon appeared, however, to be nothing more than di&s;&s;imulation; for, in a few minutes, &s;everal of them unexpectedly boarded the boat, with an intention of dragging her on &s;hore; &s;ome mu&s;|quets were immediately di&s;charged over their heads, which had the de&s;ired effect, all of them leaping directly into the &s;ea; and as &s;oon as they reached the canoe, they put back to the &s;hore as fa&s;t as they could paddle, where a va&s;t concour&s;e of their countrymen were a&s;&s;embled to receive them. They were followed to the &s;hore by the people in the boat, who found the &s;urf &s;o violent, that they did not think it &s;afe to attempt landing. They therefore coa&s;ted along the &s;hore, in hopes of finding a place where they might land with le&s;s danger; pre|&s;ently after the canoe got on &s;hore, a man with a lance in his hand ran along oppo&s;ite to the boat, flouri&s;hing his weapon, and calling out with a &s;hrill voice, which, upon enquiry of Tupia, they were informed was a mark of defiance.</P>
<P>Not being able to find a more convenient landing place, they returned, with a de&s;ign of attempting it at the place where the canoe went on &s;hore: as they were going back, the &s;ame mode of defiance was repeated by another war|rior of a more formidable appearance than the fir&s;t; having a high cap on, made of the tail
<PB N="305" REF="322">
feathers of a bird, and his body painted with &s;treaks of a variety of colours. When this man retired, another advanced in years, with a grave and &s;edate countenance, made his appear|ance upon the beach, and a&s;ked them &s;everal que&s;tions, &s;uch as from whence they came, whither they were bound, and who they were. Tupia having an&s;wered the&s;e que&s;tions, and re|peated his a&s;&s;urances, that our intentions were amicable, they appeared to be &s;omewhat paci|fied. The people in the boat now propo&s;ed going on &s;hore, to trade with them for &s;uch ar|ticles as they cho&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of, if they would quit their weapons; but they would not agree to this propo&s;al on any other terms, than the Engli&s;h leaving their mu&s;quets behind them in the boat; with this, however, prudence would not permit them to comply, e&s;pecially as they had &s;o lately experienced the di&s;&s;embling nature of the&s;e people. They therefore gave over all hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hing a friendly intercour&s;e with them, and returned to the &s;hip. And as nei|ther the bay which the boat entered, nor any other part of the i&s;land afforded either harbour or anchorage, the Captain did not think it worth while to attempt a &s;econd landing.</P>
<P>The people of this i&s;land are very tall, well proportioned, and have long hair, which, like the inhabitants of the other i&s;lands, they tie in a bunch on the top of their head; they are
<PB N="306" REF="323">
likewi&s;e tataowed on different parts of their bo|dies, but not on their po&s;teriors.</P>
<P>This i&s;land does not &s;hoot up into high peaks, like the others which they vi&s;ited, but is more level and uniform, and divided into &s;mall hil|locks, &s;ome of which are covered with groves of trees; they &s;aw no bread-fruit, and not many cocoa-nut trees, but great numbers of the tree called Etoa, were planted all along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Their cloth, as well as the manner of wear|ing it, differed in many re&s;pects from any they had met with; all that they &s;aw was died yel|low, and painted on the out&s;ide with a variety of colours. Their habit con&s;i&s;ted only of one piece with a hole made in the middle of it, thro' which they put their head; it reaches as low as their knees, and is tied clo&s;e round their bodies with a kind of yellow &s;a&s;h; &s;ome of them wear caps of the &s;ame kind as that already mention|ed, and others bind their heads with a piece of cloth re&s;embling a turban.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, the 15th of Augu&s;t, they &s;ail|ed from this i&s;land to the &s;outhward, with a fine breeze from the north, and clear plea&s;ant wea|ther; and on the 16th it being rather hazy, they were deceived by an appearance like &s;eve|ral high peaks of land, for which they bore away, but the weather clearing up, convinced them of their mi&s;take, and they re&s;umed their cour&s;e to the &s;outh.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="324">On Friday the 25th, they celebrated the anniver&s;ary of their leaving England, from whence they had now been ab&s;ent one year: a large Che&s;hire chee&s;e, which had been carefully pre&s;erved for that purpo&s;e, was brought out, and a barrel of porter tapped, which proved to be as good as any they had ever drank in Eng|land. On the 29th John Raden, the Boat|&s;wain's mate, died; this man's death was occa|&s;ioned by drinking too freely of &s;ome rum which was given him by the Boat&s;wain. On the 30th, about four o'clock in the morning, they &s;aw a large comet about 60 degrees above the horizon.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 7th of October, they di&s;|covered land at we&s;t by north, and in the af|ternoon, of the next day, they came to an an|chor oppo&s;ite the mouth of a little river about a mile and a half from the &s;hore. The Cap|tain, with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and &s;ome other gentlemen, accompanied by a party of marines, went on &s;hore in the evening, in the pinnace and yawl.</P>
<P>Having left the pinnace at the entrance of the river, Captain Cook, Mr. Banks, &amp;c. proceed|ed a little farther up, when they landed, and leaving the yawl to the care of &s;ome of their boys, went up to a few &s;mall hou&s;es which they &s;aw at a little di&s;tance. Taking the advantage of their ab&s;ence from the boat, &s;ome of the na|tives, who had concealed them&s;elves behind the bu&s;hes, &s;uddenly ru&s;hed out, and ran towards
<PB N="308" REF="325">
it, brandi&s;hing the long wooden lances which they had in their hands in a threatening man|ner. The boys perceiving them, in&s;tantly dropt down the &s;tream, but were very clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the Indians; the Cock&s;wain of the pinnace therefore fired a mu&s;quetoon over their heads, which did not &s;eem to intimidate them, as they &s;till continued their pur&s;uit; he then fired a &s;econd time over their heads, but with no bet|ter effect; alarmed at the &s;ituation of the boat, as they were now got near enough to di&s;charge their lances at it, the Cock&s;wain levelled his piece at them, and &s;hot one man dead on the &s;pot. Struck with a&s;toni&s;hment at the fall of their companion, the others &s;tood motionle&s;s for &s;ome time, but as &s;oon as they recovered from their fright, retreated to the woods with the utmo&s;t precipitation. The report of the gun &s;oon brought the advanced party back to the boats, and both the pinnace and yawl im|mediately returned to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On Monday the 9th in the morning, a great number of the natives were &s;een near the place where the gentlemen in the yawl had landed the preceding evening, and the greate&s;t part of them appeared to be unarmed. The long-boat, pin|nace and yawl, being ordered out, and manned with marines and &s;ailors, Captain Cook, toge|ther with Mr. Banks, the re&s;t of the gentlemen and Tupia went on &s;hore, and landed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, over-again&s;t &s;everal
<PB N="309" REF="326">
Indians who were &s;itting on the ground; as &s;oon as the gentlemen began to land, they immedi|ately &s;tarted up, each producing either a long pike, or a kind of truncheon made of &s;tone, with a &s;tring through the handle of it, which they twi&s;ted round their wri&s;t. Tupia was or|dered to &s;peak to them in his language; and the gentlemen were agreeably &s;urprized to find that he was well under&s;tood, the natives &s;peak|ing the Otaheitean language, only in a different dialect. Their intentions at fir&s;t appeared to be very ho&s;tile, brandi&s;hing their weapons in the u&s;ual threatening manner; upon which a mu&s;|quet was fired at &s;ome di&s;tance from them, at the effect of which the ball happening to &s;trike the water, they appeared rather terrified, and de&s;i&s;ted from their menaces. The marines be|ing drawn up, the Captain, with four or five of the gentlemen and Tupia, advanced nearer to the &s;ide of the river; Tupia again &s;poke to them, and informed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">m, that they wanted to traffick with them for provi&s;ions. They readily con&s;ented to trade, and reque&s;ted the Engli&s;h gentlemen to cro&s;s the river and come over to them; which was agreed to, upon condition that the natives would quit their weapons; but this the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip could not prevail on them to comply with. Not thinking it prudent therefore to cro&s;s the river, as they would not be per&s;uaded to lay by their arms, the gentlemen in their turn in|treated
<PB N="310" REF="327">
the Indians to come over to them, which after &s;ome time they prevailed on one of them to do; he was pre&s;ently followed by &s;everal others, bringing their weapons with them. They did not appear to &s;et any great value on the beads, iron, &amp;c. which was pre|&s;ented to them, nor would they give any thing in return, but propo&s;ed to exchange their wea|pons for tho&s;e belonging to the Engli&s;h, which being con&s;equently objected to, they endea|voured &s;everal times to &s;natch them out of their hands. But as the gentlemen were on their guard, from the information given them by Tupia that they were &s;till their enemies, their attempts to &s;eize the arms were repeatedly fru&s;|trated, and Tupia, by the direction of the gen|tlemen, gave them notice, that any further offer of violence would be puni&s;hed with in&s;tant death. One of them had, neverthele&s;s, the audacity to &s;natch Mr. Green's hanger, and re|tiring a few paces, flouri&s;hed it over his head; he, however, paid for this temerity with his life, Mr. Monkhou&s;e firing at him with a mu&s;|quet loaded with ball; and that gentleman af|terwards, with &s;ome difficulty, recovered the hanger, one of the Indians endeavouring to &s;eize it.</P>
<P>This behaviour of the natives, added to the want of fre&s;h water, induced Captain Cook to continue his cour&s;e round the head of the bay. He was &s;till in hopes of getting &s;ome of
<PB N="311" REF="328">
the Indians on board, and by pre&s;ents, added to civil u&s;age, convey through them a favoura|ble idea of the Engli&s;h to their fellow coun|trymen; and thereby &s;ettle a good corre&s;pon|dence with them. Soon after an event occured, though attended with di&s;agreeable circum&s;tan|ces, that promi&s;ed to facilitate this de&s;ign. Two canoes appeared making towards land, and Captain Cook propo&s;ed intercepting them with his boats. One of them got clear off, but the Indians in the other finding it impo&s;|&s;ible to e&s;cape the boats, began to attack them with their paddles: this compelled the Endea|vour's people to fire upon them, when four of the Indians were killed, and the other three, who were youths, jumped into the water, and endeavoured to &s;wim to &s;hore: they were how|ever taken up and brought on board. They were at fir&s;t greatly terrified, thinking they &s;hould be killed; but Tupia, by repeated a&s;|&s;urances of friend&s;hip, removed their fears, and they afterwards eat very heartily of the &s;hip's provi&s;ions. When they retired to re&s;t, in the evening, they appeared perfectly ea&s;y in their minds, and &s;lept very quietly for &s;ome hours, but in the middle of the night their fears again returned, and they appeared in great agitation, frequently making loud and di&s;mal groans. After &s;ome time, however, the friendly promi&s;es and kind care&s;&s;es of Tupia again prevailed over their fears, and they became &s;o calm and re&s;igned
<PB N="312" REF="329">
as to &s;ing a &s;ong, the tune of which was &s;olemn and &s;low, and, at the dead of night, when an univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed throughout the &s;hip, had an awful and plea&s;ing effect. The next morning, after they were dre&s;&s;ed and orna|mented, according to the mode of their coun|try, with necklaces and bracelets, Captain Cook propo&s;ed &s;etting them on &s;hore, that they might give a favourable report to their countrymen of the reception they had met with. They te&s;tified much &s;atisfaction when told they were going to be relea&s;ed: but &s;eemed under great apprehen&s;ions of danger, at finding the boat approach Captain Cook's fir&s;t landing-place, intimating, that the inhabitants here were their foes, and that they always killed and ate their enemies. The Captain, neverthele&s;s, judged it expedient to land near the &s;ame &s;pot, which he accordingly did with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and Tupia, re&s;olving at the &s;ame time to protect the youths from any injury that might be offered them. The gentlemen had not been long on &s;hore before the boys left them, but on &s;eeing two large parties of the Indians advanc|ing ha&s;tily towards them, they returned, and again put them&s;elves under their protection. As the Indians drew nearer, one of the boys di&s;co|vered his uncle among&s;t them, and a conver&s;ation took place between them acro&s;s the river, in which the lad gave a very ju&s;t account of the ho&s;|pitality he had met with, and took great pains
<PB N="313" REF="330">
to di&s;play their cloaths and finery. Soon after the uncle &s;wam acro&s;s the river, bringing with him a green bow, as a token of friend&s;hip, which was received as &s;uch, and &s;everal pre&s;ents were made him. The body of the Indian, who was &s;hot the day before, lay in the &s;ame place where he fell: one of the boys had covered it with part of his cloaths; and after the gentlemen had re|tired, the Indian performed a kind of ceremony over it, by throwing a green branch towards it, and the body was afterwards carried in a raft acro&s;s the river. Notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ence of the uncle of one of the boys, all three of them, by their own de&s;ire, returned to the &s;hip, but as the Captain intended &s;ailing the next morning, he &s;ent them on &s;hore again in the evening, though much again&s;t their inclination; the names of the&s;e boys were Taahourange, Koikerange and Maragovete. They informed Captain Cook, that there was a particular kind of deer upon the i&s;land, likewi&s;e taro, eapes, romara, yams, a kind of long pepper, bald coote, and black birds.</P>
<P>On the 11th Captain Cook &s;et &s;ail, in hopes of finding a better anchoring-place, after giv|ing this bay (called by the natives Toaneora) the name of <HI>Poverty Bay</HI>; and the &s;outh-we&s;t point he called <HI>Young Nick's Head,</HI> on account of its being fir&s;t perceived by a lad on board named Nicholas Young. They were becalmed in the afternoon, and &s;everal cances came off
<PB N="314" REF="331">
from the &s;hore with Indians, who received ma|ny pre&s;ents, and afterwards bartered even their cloaths, and &s;ome of their paddles, &s;o eager were they of being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as many Euro|pean commodities as po&s;&s;ible. A &s;ingle tree formed the bottom of their canoes, and the up|per part con&s;i&s;ted of two planks &s;ewed together: they &s;at on thwarts; their paddles were painted red, repre&s;enting many uncommon figures, and were curiou&s;ly wrought.</P>
<P>They were armed with bludgeons made of wood, and of the bone of a large animal; they called them <HI>Patoo, Patoo,</HI> and they were well contrived for clo&s;e fighting.</P>
<P>After they had fini&s;hed their traffic, they &s;et off in &s;uch a hurry, that they forgot three of their companions, who remained on board all night.</P>
<P>They te&s;tified their fears and apprehen&s;ions, notwith&s;tanding Tupia took great pains to con|vince them they were in no danger; and about &s;even the next morning a canoe came off, with four Indians on board. It was at fir&s;t with difficulty the Indians in the &s;hip could prevail on tho&s;e in the canoe to come near them; and it was not till after the former had a&s;&s;ured them that the Engli&s;h did not eat men, that they came along-&s;ide the Endeavour. The Chief came on board, who&s;e face was tataowed, with a remarkable patoo patoo in his hand; and in this canoe the three Indians left the &s;hip.
<PB N="315" REF="332">
Captain Cook gave the name of <HI>Cape Table</HI> to a point of land about &s;even leagues to the &s;outh of Poverty Bay, its figure greatly re&s;embling a table; and the i&s;land, called by the natives <HI>Teabowry,</HI> he named <HI>Portland I&s;land,</HI> it being very &s;imilar to that of the &s;ame name in the Briti&s;h Channel. It is joined to the main by a chain of rocks, near a mile in length, partly above water. There are &s;everal &s;hoals, called &s;hambles, about three miles to the north-ea&s;t of Portland, one of which the Endeavour narrowly e&s;caped; there is, however, a pa&s;&s;age between them with 20 fathom water. Some parts of Portland I&s;land, as well as the Main, were cultivated; and pumice-&s;tone in great quantities lying along the &s;hore, within the bay, indicated that there is a volcano in the i&s;land. High pailings upon the ridges of hills were al&s;o vi&s;ible in two places, which were judged to be de&s;igned for religious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>On the 12th &s;everal Indians came off in a canoe; they were disfigured in a &s;trange man|ner, danced and &s;ung, and appeared at times to be peaceably inclined, and at others to me|nace ho&s;tilities; but, notwith&s;tanding Tupia &s;trongly invited them to come on board, none of them would quit the canoe. Whil&s;t the En|deavour was getting clear of the &s;hambles, five canoes full of Indians came off, and &s;eemed to threaten the people on board, by brandi&s;hing their lances, and other ho&s;tile ge&s;tures; a
<PB N="316" REF="333">
four pounder, loaded with grape &s;hot, was there|fore ordered to be fired, but not pointed at them. This had the de&s;ired effect, and made them drop a-&s;tern. Two more canoes came off, whil&s;t the Endeavour lay at anchor; but the Indians on board behaved very peaceably and quiet, and received &s;everal pre&s;ents, but would not come on board.</P>
<P>On Friday the 13th, in the morning, they made for an inlet, but finding it not &s;heltered they &s;tood out again, and were chaced by a canoe, filled with Indians, but the Endeavour out-&s;ailed them. She pur&s;ued her cour&s;e round the bay, but did not find an opening.</P>
<P>The next morning they had a view of the inland country; it was mountainous, and co|vered with &s;now in the interior parts, but the land towards the &s;ea was flat and uncultivated, and in may places there were groves of high trees. Nine canoes full of Indians came from the &s;hore, and five of them, after having con|&s;ulted together, pur&s;ued the Endeavour, ap|parently with an ho&s;tile de&s;ign. Tupia was de&s;ired to acquaint them that immediate de&s;|truction would en&s;ue, if they per&s;evered in their attempts; but words had no influence, and a four pounder, with grape &s;hot, was fired, to give them &s;ome notion of the arms of their opponents. They were terrified at this kind of rea&s;oning, and paddled away fa&s;ter than they came. Tupia then hailed the fugitives, and
<PB N="317" REF="334">
acquainted them, that if they came in a peace|able manner, and left their arms behind, no annoyance would be offered them: one of the canoes &s;ubmitting to the&s;e terms, came along &s;ide the &s;hip, and received many pre&s;ents; but the other canoes returning, and per&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ame menacing behaviour, interrupted this friendly intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>The following day, Sunday the 15th, they were vi&s;ited by &s;ome fi&s;hing boats, the people in which conducted them&s;elves in an amicable manner; though the fi&s;h which they had on board had been caught &s;o long that they were not eatable, Captain Cook purcha&s;ed them, merely for the &s;ake of promoting a traffick with the natives. In the afternoon a large canoe, with a number of armed Indians, came up, and one of them who was remarkably cloath|ed, with a black &s;kin, found means to de|fraud the Captain of a piece of red baize, under pretence of bartering the &s;kin he had on for it. As &s;oon as he had got the baize into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of giving the &s;kin in return agreeable to his bargain, he rolied them up together, and ordered the canoe to put off from the &s;hip, turning a deaf ear to the repeat|ed remon&s;trances of the Captain again&s;t his un|ju&s;t behaviour. After a &s;hort time this canoe, together with the fi&s;hing boats which had put off at the &s;ame time, came back to the &s;hip, and trade was again begun. During this &s;econd
<PB N="318" REF="335">
traffick with the Indians, one of them unex|pectedly &s;eized Tupia's little boy Tayota, and pulling him into his canoe in&s;tantly put her off, and paddled away with the utmo&s;t &s;peed; &s;eve|ral mu&s;quets were immediately di&s;charged at the people in the canoe, and one of them re|ceiving a wound they all let go the boy, who before was held down in the bottom of the canoe. Tayota taking the advantage of their con&s;ternation, immediately jumped into the &s;ea, and &s;wam back towards the Endeavour, he was taken on board, without having received any harm; but his &s;trength was &s;o much exhau&s;ted with the weight of his cloaths, that it was with great difficulty he reached the &s;hip. In con&s;e|quence of this attempt to carry off Tayota, Captain Cook called the Cape off which it hap|pened <HI>Cape Kidnappers,</HI> lying in latitude 39 deg. 43 min. and longitude 182 deg. 24 min. we&s;t, and is very di&s;tingui&s;hable by high cliffs and white rocks, that &s;urround it. Its di&s;tance from Portland I&s;land is about 13 leagues, form|ing the &s;outh point of a bay, which the Cap|tain named <HI>Hawke</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> in honour of Sir Ed|ward, who then pre&s;ided at the admiralty board.</P>
<P>As every circum&s;tance that tends to eluci|date the manners and cu&s;toms of the&s;e people mu&s;t attract the attention of the curious reader, we cannot omit Tayota's behaviour upon re|covering from his fright, occa&s;ioned by his being kidnapped. He produced a fi&s;h, and acquaint|ed
<PB N="319" REF="336">
Tupia, that he de&s;igned to make an offer|ing of it to his God, or Eatua, as a te&s;timonial of his gratitude for his deliverance. Tupia approved of his intention, and by his direction the fi&s;h was ca&s;t into the &s;ea. This is an evi|dent proof, that even the&s;e unenlightened &s;a|vages, by the mere impul&s;e of nature, believe in the exi&s;tence of a particular providence.</P>
<P>The Endeavour now pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall i&s;land, white and high, &s;uppo&s;ed to be inhabited only by fi&s;hermen, as it appeared quite barren, and was named <HI>Bare I&s;land.</HI> On the 17th Captain Cook gave the name of Cape <HI>Turn Again</HI> to a head-land, in latitude 40 deg. 34 min. S. longi|tude, 182 deg. 55 min. we&s;t, becau&s;e the En|deavour here turned again. Before the Endea|vour touched at New Zealand, it was not cer|tainly known whether it was an i&s;land, or part of the continent, wherefore the lords of the ad|miralty had, by their in&s;tructions, directed Captain Cook to &s;ail along the coa&s;ts as far as 40 degrees &s;outh latitude, and from thence, if the land appeared to extend farther, to return again to the northward. Agreeable to the&s;e in|&s;tructions, the Captain being oppo&s;ite to Cape <HI>Turn Again,</HI> changed his cour&s;e from &s;outh to north; and the wind having likewi&s;e veered to the &s;outh, he returned nearly in his former track, &s;ailing along the coa&s;t. This Cape is remark|able for a &s;tratum of clay of a bright brown co|lour; its prominence gradually dimini&s;hes to|wards
<PB N="320" REF="337">
the north-&s;ide, but to the &s;outh its de&s;|cent is not &s;o regular.</P>
<P>The land betwen this Cape and Kidnapper's Bay is unequal, and re&s;embles the high downs of England. There appeared numerous inha|bitants, and &s;everal villages. Wedne&s;day the 18th the Endeavour came a-brea&s;t of a penin|&s;ula in Portland I&s;land, named <HI>Terakako,</HI> when a canoe, with five Indians, came up to the &s;hip. Two Chiefs who were in this canoe came on board, where they remained all night, and were treated with great civility. One of the Chiefs was a remarkable comely man, and his countenance was open and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. Their curio&s;ity was uncommon, and their acknow|ledgments, for the trifling pre&s;ents they receiv|ed, were extremely grateful. The Chiefs would neither eat nor drink, but the &s;ervants made up for their ma&s;ters ab&s;tinence, by their vora|cious appetites. The three boys had given the&s;e natives an account of the ho&s;pitality and libera|lity of the Engli&s;h, which had prevailed upon them to pay this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 19th the Endeavour pa&s;&s;ed a remarkable head land, which Captain Cook named <HI>Gable End Foreland.</HI> It is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a rock, in the &s;hape of a church &s;pire, which is very near it. Here three canoes came up, and one Indian came on board; he received &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents, and retired to his companions.
<PB N="321" REF="338">
He wore a new garment of white &s;ilky flax, with a border of black, red and white.</P>
<P>Many of the Indians had pieces of green|&s;tone round their necks, by way of necklaces; they were tran&s;parent, like an emerald, and appeared, on examination, to be a &s;pecies of Nephritic-&s;tone, of which all their ornaments of this kind con&s;i&s;ted. Mr. Banks and the other gentlemen obtained &s;everal pieces of it.</P>
<P>The dialect of the&s;e Indians was not &s;o gut|tural as that of the others, and they &s;poke the mo&s;t like the inhabitants of Otaheite. The phy&s;iognomy of &s;ome was agreeable, their no&s;es being rather prominent than flat.</P>
<P>On the 20th they anchored in a bay, about two leagues to the north of the Foreland. The natives in canoes invited them hither, and be|haved very amicably. There appeared to be two Chiefs, who came on board: they received pre&s;ents of linen, which gave them much &s;ati&s;|faction; but they did not hold &s;pike-nails in &s;uch e&s;timation as the inhabitants of &s;ome of the i&s;lands. They were dre&s;&s;ed in jackets, the one ornamented with tufts of red feathers, the other with dog's &s;kin. The other Indians in the ca|noes traded with the Endeavour's people, with|out attempting any impo&s;ition; and towards the evening the Chiefs returned. The Captain, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, now went on &s;hore, and were courteou&s;ly received by the in|habitants, who did not appear in numerous bo|dies,
<PB N="322" REF="339">
to avoid giving offence. They received &s;everal trifling pre&s;ents, and the Captain had the plea&s;ure to find fre&s;h water, in the cour&s;e of a tour round the bay. They remained on &s;hore all night, and next day Mr. Banks and the Doctor di&s;covered &s;everal plants, and many beautiful birds, particularly quails and large pigeons. There were &s;ome hou&s;es with fences, to &s;helter them from the wind, and many &s;tages for drying fi&s;h near the place where the gentle|men landed. Dogs with &s;mall pointed ears, and very ugly, were the only tame animals a|mong them. At the watering-place the Cap|tain ordered a line to be drawn, and enjoined the natives not to pa&s;s it, which injunction they ci|villy complied with. Many hou&s;es were con|tiguous, and the lands in the adjacent vallies were regular flats, neatly laid out in &s;mall plan|tations, the ground appearing to be broken, as if de&s;igned for gardens. They have &s;weet po|tatoes, like tho&s;e of North America, in great quantities; and the cloth plant grows here &s;pon|taneou&s;ly. There is plenty of fi&s;h in the bay, &s;uch as crabs, cray-fi&s;h, and &s;hip-jacks or hor&s;e mackrel, which are larger than tho&s;e upon our coa&s;ts. The number of &s;upple jacks that grow in the adjacent woods, render them almo&s;t im|pa&s;&s;able; but they thereby afford &s;helter to their feathered inhabitants: the flat land was planted with cocos, and the hollow parts with gourds. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander vi&s;ited &s;everal of
<PB N="323" REF="340">
the natives hou&s;es, and they met with a very civil reception. Fi&s;h con&s;tituted their principal food at this time, and the root of a &s;ort of fern &s;erved them for bread, which when roa&s;ted up|on a fire, and dive&s;ted of its bark, was &s;weet and clammy; in ta&s;te not di&s;agreeable, but un|plea&s;ant from its number of fibres. Vegetables were, doubtle&s;s, at other &s;ea&s;ons very plentiful. The women paint their faces red, which &s;o far from increa&s;ing, dimini&s;hes the very little beau|ty they have. The mens faces were not in ge|neral painted, but &s;ome were rubbed over with red ocre from head to foot, their apparel not excepted. Though they could not be compared to the inhabitants of Otaheite for cleanline&s;s in general, they &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in this re&s;pect in &s;ome particulars. Every dwelling was &s;upplied with a privy, and they had dunghills for depo|&s;iting dirt and filth. The women wore a girdle made of the blade of gra&s;s under a petticoat, and to this girdle was tied in front a bunch of fra|grant leaves. They &s;eemed to hold cha&s;tity in but little e&s;timation, many of the young fe|males re&s;orting to the watering-place, where they bountifully be&s;towed every favour that was reque&s;ted. One of the officers on &s;hore, meet|ing with an elderly woman, he accompanied her to her hou&s;e, and having pre&s;ented her with &s;ome cloth and beads, a young girl was &s;ingled out, and he was given to under&s;tand he might retire with her. Soon after an elderly man,
<PB N="324" REF="341">
with two women, came in as vi&s;itors, and with much formality &s;aluted all the company, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of the place, which is by gently joining the tips of their no&s;es together. The officer upon his return was furni&s;hed with a guide, who led him a much better road than that he had come, and whenever they came to a brook or rivulet, the Indian took him upon his back to pre&s;erve him from being wet; &s;e|veral of the inhabitants were curiou&s;ly tataowed, and one old man, in particular, was marked on the brea&s;t with various figures. There was an axe made of the green &s;tone, already mention|ed, which could not be purcha&s;ed, though ma|ny things were offered in exchange. At night they danced in a very uncouth manner, making antick ge&s;tures, lolling out their tongues, with other &s;trange grimaces; and in the&s;e dances old men with grey beards were, as well as the young ones, capital performers. They carried their civility &s;o far, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mr. Banks and his company with one of their canoes to carry them on board; but the Endeavour's people being unacquainted with the method of &s;teer|ing &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el, &s;he was over&s;et, but no one was drowned; and they reached the &s;hip without any farther accident, &s;ome of the Indians having voluntarily engaged to conduct her. During the &s;tay of the gentlemen on &s;hore, many of the natives went off in their canoes, and trafficked with the &s;hip's company,
<PB N="325" REF="342">
preferring at fir&s;t the cloth of Otaheite to that of Europe; but it &s;oon dimini&s;hed in its value. Several of the Indians went on board, and te&s;|tified their curio&s;ity and &s;urpri&s;e, with regard to the different parts of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Sunday 22, in the evening, they &s;ailed from this bay, which by the natives is called <HI>Tega|doo,</HI> and lies in latitude 38 deg. 10 min. &s;outh. The wind being contrary, they put into ano|ther bay a little to the &s;outh, called by the na|tives <HI>Tolaga,</HI> in order to complete their wood and water, and extend their corre&s;pondence with the natives; in this bay they came to an anchor in about eleven fathom water, with a good &s;andy bottom. Several canoes appeared, with Indi|ans on board, and they trafficked very fairly for gla&s;s bottles and cloth. The Captain, Mr. Banks, and the Doctor, went in the afternoon to examine the water, and found it extremely good; here was al&s;o plenty of wood, and the natives behaved with as much civility as tho&s;e they had ju&s;t departed from.</P>
<P>On the 24th, Mr. Gore and the marines were &s;ent on &s;hore, to guard the people employed in cutting wood and filling water. Captain Cook, Mr. Banks and the Doctor al&s;o went on &s;hore; the two latter employed them&s;elves in collecting plants. In their route they found in the vales many hou&s;es uninhabited, the natives re&s;iding chiefly in &s;light &s;heds, on the ridges of the hills, which are very &s;teep. In a valley between two
<PB N="326" REF="343">
very high hills they &s;aw a curious rock, that formed a large arch, oppo&s;ite to the &s;ea; this cavity was in length above &s;eventy feet, in breadth thirty, and near fifty in height; it com|manded a view of the hills and the bay, which had a very happy effect. Indeed, the whole country about the bay is agreeable beyond de|&s;cription, and if properly cultivated would be a mo&s;t fertile &s;pot. The hills are covered with beautiful flowering &s;hrubs, intermixed with a great number of tall and &s;tately palms, which perfume the air, and make it mo&s;t agreeably odoriferous. Mr. Banks and the Doctor found the tree that produces the cabbage, which, when boiled, was very good; and &s;ome other trees that yielded a fine tran&s;parent gum. Between the hills were fruitful villages, that might have been &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated, or turned into pa&s;|turage. Various kinds of edible herbage, were met with in great abundance, and there was rea&s;on to believe there were many trees that produced fruit fit to eat, &s;ome of which the gentlemen examined. The plant, from which the cloth is made, is a kind of Hemerocallis, the leaves of which afford a &s;trong glo&s;&s;y flax, equally adapted to cloathing, as making of ropes. There are &s;weet potatoes and yam plan|tations near their hou&s;es, which are carefully cultivated. The&s;e gentlemen, upon their re|turn, met an old man, who entertained them with the military exerci&s;es of the natives,

which are performed with the <HI>Patoo Patoo,</HI> and the lance. The former has already been men|tioned, and is u&s;ed as a battle-axe; the latter is ten or twelve feet in length, made of extreme hard wood, and &s;harpened at each end. A &s;take was &s;ub&s;tituted for their old warriors &s;uppo&s;ed enemy; he fir&s;t attacked him with his lance, when, having pierced him, the Patoo Patoo was u&s;ed to demoli&s;h his head, and the force with which he &s;truck would at one blow have &s;plit any man's &s;kull. This mode of fighting in|duced the gentlemen to believe no quarter was ever given here in war. The natives in this part are not very numerous; they are tolerably well &s;haped, but lean and tall; their faces re|&s;emble tho&s;e of Europeans; their no&s;es are aqueline; their eyes dark coloured; their hair is black, which is tied up on the top of their heads, and their beards are of a moderate length. Their tataowing is done very curiou&s;ly in va|rious figures, which makes their &s;kin re&s;emble carving; it is confined to the principal men, the females and &s;ervants u&s;ing only red paint, with which they daub their faces, that other|wi&s;e would not be di&s;agreeable. Their cloth is white, glo&s;&s;y and very even; it is worn prin|cipally by the men, though it is wrought by the women, who, indeed, are condemned to all the drudgery and labour.</P>
<P>On the 25th an armourer's forge was &s;et up on &s;hore for nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es. Mr. Banks and
<PB N="328" REF="347">
Dr. Solander went again in &s;earch of plants. Tupia, who was with them engaged in a con|ver&s;ation with one of the prie&s;ts, and they &s;eem|ed to agree in their opinions upon the &s;ubject of religion. Tupia, in the cour&s;e of this con|ference, enquired, whether the report of their eating men was founded in truth; to which the prie&s;t replied it was, but that they ate none but declared foes, after they were killed in war. This idea is, however, horrid and barbarous, and proves that they carry their re&s;entment even beyond death.</P>
<P>Captain Cook and Dr. Solander went on the 27th to in&s;pect the bay, when the Doctor was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find the natives in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a boy's top, which they knew how to &s;pin by whipping it, and he purcha&s;ed it out of curio&s;ity. Mr. Banks was during this time employed in attaining the &s;ummit of a &s;teep hill, that had previou&s;ly engaged their attention; and near it he found many uninhabited hou&s;es. Here were two rows of poles about fourteen or fifteen feet high, covered over with &s;ticks, which made an avenue of about five feet in width, extending near a hundred yards down the hill in an irregular line: the intent of this erection was not di&s;covered. When the gen|tlemen met at the watering-place, the Indians, by de&s;ire, &s;ung their war &s;ong, which was a &s;trange medley of &s;houting, &s;ighing and gri|mace, at which the women a&s;&s;i&s;ted. The next
<PB N="329" REF="348">
day Captain Cook and the other gentlemen went upon an i&s;land at the entrance of the bay, and met with a canoe that was &s;ixty &s;even feet in length, &s;ix in breadth, and four in height; her bottom, which was &s;harp, con&s;i&s;ted of three trunks of trees, and the &s;ides and head were curiou&s;ly carved. There was a large unfini&s;hed hou&s;e upon this i&s;land; the po&s;ts which &s;up|ported it were ornamented with carvings, that did not appear to be done upon the &s;pot; and as the inhabitants &s;eem to &s;et a great value upon works of this kind, future navigators might find their advantage in carrying &s;uch articles to trade with. Though the po&s;ts of this hou&s;e were judged to be brought here, the people have certainly a ta&s;te for carving, as their boats, paddles, and tops of walking-&s;ticks evince. Their favourite figure is a volute or &s;piral, which is &s;ometimes &s;ingle, double and triple, and is done with great exactne&s;s, though the only in&s;truments the gentlemen &s;aw were an axe made of &s;tone, and a chi&s;&s;el. Their ta&s;te, however, mu&s;t be acknowledged whim&s;ical and extravagant, &s;carce ever imitating nature.</P>
<P>Their huts are built under trees; their form is an oblong &s;quare: the door is low on the &s;ide, and the windows are at the ends; reeds, covered with thatch, compo&s;e the walls; the beams of the eaves, which come to the ground, are covered with thatch; mo&s;t of the hou&s;es the gentlemen &s;aw had been de&s;erted, through fear
<PB N="330" REF="349">
of the Engli&s;h upon their landing. There are many beautiful parrots, and great numbers of birds of different kinds, particularly one who&s;e note re&s;embled the European black bird; but here is no ground fowl or poultry; nor were there any quadrupeds, except rats and dogs, and the&s;e were not numerous. The dogs are con&s;idered as delicate food, and their &s;kins &s;erve for ornaments to their apparel. There is a great variety of fi&s;h in the bay: &s;hell and cray-fi&s;h is very plentiful; &s;ome of the latter weigh near a dozen pounds.</P>
<P>Sunday, Oct. 29, they &s;et &s;ail from this bay, which is called by the natives <HI>Tolaga.</HI> It is &s;eated in latitude 38 deg. 22 min. &s;outh, four leagues to the north of Gable end Foreland: there are two high rocks at the entrance of the bay, which form a cove very convenient for procuring wood and water. There is a high rocky i&s;land off the north point of the bay, which affords good anchorage, having a fine &s;andy bottom, and from &s;even to thirteen fa|thom water, and is likewi&s;e &s;heltered from all but the north-ea&s;t wind.</P>
<P>Captain Cook obtained nothing here in trade but &s;ome &s;weet potatoes, and a little fi&s;h. This is a very hilly country, though it pre&s;ents the eye with an agreeable verdure, various woods, and many &s;mall plantations. Mr. Banks met with a great number of trees in the woods, quite unknown to Europeans: the firewood re|&s;embled
<PB N="331" REF="350">
the maple tree, and produced a gum of whiti&s;h colour; other trees yielded a gum of deep yellow green. The only roots they met with were yams and &s;weet potatoes, though the &s;oil appears very proper for producing every &s;pecies of vegetables.</P>
<P>Sailing to the northward, they fell in with a &s;mall i&s;land, about a mile di&s;tant from the north-ea&s;t point of the main; and this being the mo&s;t ea&s;tern part of it, the Captain named it EAST CAPE, and the i&s;land EAST ISLAND: it was but &s;mall, and appeared barren. The cape is in latitude 37 degrees 42 minutes 30 &s;econds &s;outh. There are many &s;mall bays from Tolaga Bay to Ea&s;t Cape. When the Endeavour had doubled the cape, many villages pre&s;ented them&s;elves to view, and the adjacent land appeared cultivat|ed. In the evening of the 30th, Lieutenant Hicks di&s;covered a bay, to which his name was given. Next morning, about nine, &s;everal ca|noes came off from &s;hore with a number of armed men, who appeared to have ho&s;tile in|tentions. Before the&s;e had reached the &s;hip, another canoe, larger than any that had yet been &s;een, full of armed Indians came off, and made towards the Endeavour with great expedition. The Captain now judging it expedient to pre|vent, if po&s;&s;ible, their attacking him, ordered a gun to be fired over their heads; this not pro|ducing the de&s;ired effect, another gun was fired with ball, which threw them into &s;uch con&s;ter|nation,
<PB N="332" REF="351">
that they immediately returned much fa&s;ter than they came. This precipitate re|treat, induced the Captain to give the cape, off which it happened, the name of CAPE RUN|AWAY, which lies in latitude 37 degrees 32 mi|nutes, longitude 181 degrees 48 minutes. Next morning, at day break, they &s;aw between forty and fifty canoes along &s;hore, many of which came off in the manner they had done the day before, &s;houting, and menacing an attack. One of their Chiefs in the large&s;t of the ca|noes made &s;everal harangues, and by the me|nacing flouri&s;h of his pike, &s;eemed to bid the &s;hip defiance; but the gentlemen continuing to invite them to trade, they at la&s;t came clo&s;e a|long-&s;ide, and the Chief who had been declaim|ing, after uttering a &s;entence, took up a &s;tone and threw it again&s;t the &s;ide of the &s;hip, which appeared to be a declaration of ho&s;tilities, as they in&s;tantly &s;eized their arms; Tupia told them, that immediate de&s;truction would en&s;ue, if they per&s;evered in their de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured them of the gentlemens paci|fic intentions, and that they only wanted to traf|fick with them. Neither his threats nor per|&s;ua&s;ions would probably have had any effect, had he not at the &s;ame time &s;hewn them &s;ome pieces of cloth, which attracted their eye, and brought them to rea&s;on. The gentlemen now purcha&s;ed a great quantity of cray-fi&s;h, mu&s;cles and conger-eels. The&s;e Indians did not attempt
<PB N="333" REF="352">
any fraud in their trading; but &s;ome others, who &s;ucceeded them, took the goods from the &s;hip without making proper returns: one of them, who had been particularly culpable, and &s;eemed to pride him&s;elf upon his cunning, put|ting off with his canoe, was brought back by a mu&s;quet being fired over his head, and this pre&s;ently produced good order. But when the &s;ailors began to traffick with the Indians, they renewed their former fraudulent practices, with great in&s;olence. One of them &s;eized &s;ome linen that was hanging to dry, and made off with it; a mu&s;quet was fired over his head to make him return, but this did not prevail, and even after another was fired at him with &s;mall &s;hot, which hit him in the back, he &s;till per&s;evered in his de&s;ign. Upon this the re&s;t of the Indians dropt a-&s;tern at &s;ome di&s;tance, and &s;et up their &s;ong of defiance. They did not, however, make any preparations for attacking the &s;hip; but the Captain judged, that if he &s;uffered them to go off without convincing them of his power of avenging the in&s;ult, it might give an un|favourable opinion of the Engli&s;h, to the na|tives on &s;hore. He accordingly fired a four pounder, which pa&s;&s;ed over them, and the ef|fect it had in the water terrified them &s;o greatly, that they made to &s;hore with the utmo&s;t preci|pitancy. In the afternoon they de&s;cried a high i&s;land to the we&s;t, and &s;ome time after perceiv|ed &s;ome other i&s;lands and rocks in the &s;ame
<PB N="334" REF="353">
quarter; not being able to weather them before night came on, they bore up between them and the main-land. About &s;even in the evening a double canoe, built like tho&s;e at Otaheite, but carved after their peculiar manner, came up to the &s;hip, and Tupia entered into a friendly con|ver&s;ation with the Indians on board; when, on a &s;udden, it being now dark, they pelted the &s;hip with &s;tones, and then retreated. Tupia was told by the Indians in the canoe, that the i&s;land clo&s;e to which the Endeavour lay, was called <HI>Mowtohera</HI>; it was but a few miles from the main-land, of no great extent, but pretty high. They &s;aw a high round mountain, &s;outh-we&s;t by we&s;t of <HI>Mowtohera,</HI> which the Captain named MOUNT EDGECOMBE.</P>
<P>The next morning, November 2, many ca|noes made their appearance, and one, which proved to be the &s;ame that gave the &s;alute the night before, came up, and Tupia again en|gaged in conver&s;ation with the people in her. After behaving very peaceably about an hour, the fit of pelting again &s;eized them, and they gave the &s;hip another volley of &s;tones; but a mu&s;quet being fired, they in&s;tantly took to their paddles.</P>
<P>In the forenoon, of the &s;ame day, the En|deavour &s;ailed between a low flat i&s;land and the main: the villages upon the latter were more exten&s;ive than any they had yet &s;een. They were upon the high land next the &s;ea, and were
<PB N="335" REF="354">
&s;urrounded by a bank with rails on the top of it, and a ditch. There were &s;ome inclo&s;ures that re&s;embled forts, and the whole had the ap|pearance of fortified places. The Endeavour pa&s;&s;ed the night under an i&s;land about twenty miles from the main, which they named the MAYOR. In the morning of the 3d, they gave the name of THE COURT OF ALDERMEN to a number of &s;mall i&s;lands that lay contiguous, about twelve miles from the main, between which there are &s;everal other &s;mall i&s;lands mo&s;t|ly barren, but very high. The a&s;pect of the main-land was now much changed, the &s;oil ap|pearing barren, and the country very thinly in|habited. The Chief, who governed the di&s;|trict from Cape <HI>Turnagain</HI> to this coa&s;t, was named <HI>Teratu.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday the 3d, three canoes came a-long|&s;ide with &s;everal Indians. The&s;e canoes were built very different from the others, being form|ed of the trunks of &s;ingle trees, made hollow by burning: they were not carved, or in any &s;hape ornamented. The&s;e Indians were of a darker complexion than the others, but made u&s;e of the &s;ame modes of defiance, and threw &s;everal &s;tones and &s;ome of their lances into the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The &s;ame afternoon the Endeavour &s;ailed to|wards an inlet they had di&s;covered, and anchor|ed in &s;even fathom water. She was &s;oon after &s;urrounded by &s;everal canoes, and the Indians
<PB N="336" REF="355">
at fir&s;t did not &s;hew any &s;igns that they intend|ed committing ho&s;tilities. One of the Endea|vour's people &s;hot a bird, which the Indians conveyed on board, without te&s;tifying any &s;ur|pri&s;e at the event. For their civility, the Cap|tain gave them a piece of cloth. But this fa|vour had a very oppo&s;ite influence to what was expected, for when it grew dark, they &s;ung one of their menacing &s;ongs, and attempted to car|ry off the anchor's buoy. Some mu&s;quets were now fired over them, which &s;eemed rather to irritate than terrify them, and upon their going off, they threatened to return the next morning in greater numbers; they came back however the &s;ame night about eleven o'clock, in hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing the &s;hip's crew; but finding them on their guard, they again retired.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 4th, a great number of canoes, with near two hundred men, armed with &s;pears, lances and &s;tones, made their ap|pearance, &s;eemingly re&s;olved to attack the &s;hip, and de&s;irous of boarding her, but could not determine at what part, changing their &s;ta|tions, and paddling round her. The&s;e motions kept the crew upon the watch, in the rain, whil&s;t Tupia, at the reque&s;t of the Captain, u&s;ed eve|ry di&s;&s;ua&s;ive argument he could &s;ugge&s;t to pre|vent their carrying their apparent de&s;igns into execution; but his expo&s;tulations did not pa|cify them till &s;ome mu&s;quets were fired; they then laid a&s;ide their ho&s;tile intentions, and be|gan
<PB N="337" REF="356">
to trade: they &s;old two of their weapons without fraud, but a third, for which they had received cloth, they would not deliver up, and in&s;tead of paying any attention to the demand that was made of it, they only laughed at them, and turned their expo&s;tulations into ridicule. As the Captain propo&s;ed to &s;tay &s;ome days at this place, that he might ob&s;erve the Tran&s;it of Mercury, he judged it expedient to cha&s;ti&s;e the&s;e people for their in&s;olence and knavery; accordingly &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot were fired upon the principal offender, and a mu&s;quet-ball went through his canoe. His companions left him to his fate, without taking the lea&s;t notice of him, though he was wounded, and continu|ed to trade without any di&s;compo&s;ure. They for &s;ome time traded very fairly, but returning to their male practices, another canoe was fired upon, and &s;truck: they &s;oon after paddled away, whil&s;t a round &s;hot was fired over them.</P>
<P>Thus we find, that theft and chicane are as prevalent among&s;t the inhabitants of New Zea|land, as tho&s;e of Otaheite; from whence we might conclude, that in all uncivilized nations, probity is not con&s;idered as a virtue, or theft as a vice. Having no puni&s;hment for crimes of this kind, it may be urged, that they are not taught to con&s;ider them as &s;uch; but if nature has im|planted in us ju&s;t ideas of right and wrong, they mu&s;t operate as forcibly upon the inhabi|tants under the line, as on tho&s;e of other climes;
<PB N="338" REF="357">
and a native of Otaheite mu&s;t be equally con|&s;cious of a breach of natural ju&s;tice as the mo&s;t poli&s;hed European. However, as this is e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the doctrine of innate ideas, which would lead us into a large field of controver&s;y, we &s;hall leave the reader to his own opinion upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In &s;earching for a convenient anchoring-place, the Captain &s;aw a village upon a high point, near the head of the bay, fortified like tho&s;e villages already mentioned. Having met with a place to his mind near where the Endeavour lay, he returned to the &s;hip, and &s;ailed to that &s;pot, where he ca&s;t anchor.</P>
<P>Several of the Indians came off to the &s;hip on the 5th, but behaved much better than they had done the preceding day. They had with them an old man, who had before te&s;tified his probity and di&s;cretion; and he appeared to be of &s;uperior rank to the re&s;t. He came on board with another Indian, when the Captain pre&s;ent|ed them with &s;ome nails, and two pieces of cloth of Engli&s;h manufacture. <HI>Tojava</HI> (which was the name of the old man) informed Mr. Banks, that the natives had been in great terror of the Engli&s;h; when he was informed, that the Captain and his people had no ill de&s;ign a|gain&s;t the Indians; but, on the contrary, want|ed to e&s;tabli&s;h a friendly intercour&s;e, and to traf|fick with them. Tojava then acquainted the Captain, that they were often vi&s;ited by free|booters
<PB N="339" REF="358">
from the north, who &s;tripped them of all they could lay their hands on, and often made captives of their children and wives; and that being ignorant who the Engli&s;h were upon their fir&s;t arrival, the natives had taken the alarm upon the &s;hip's appearing off the coa&s;t, but were now &s;atisfied of their good intent. He added, that to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the&s;e plunderers, their hou&s;es were built contiguous near the tops of rocks, where they are more able to defend them&s;elves. Probably their po|verty and mi&s;ery may be a&s;cribed to the ravages of this banditti, who often &s;trip them of every nece&s;&s;ary of life. Whil&s;t they were fi&s;hing for mullets in the bay, the Indians who were upon the banks te&s;tified their friend&s;hip by every po&s;|&s;ible means, and gave them an invitation to come on &s;hore.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip, which they had received from the gentlemen on board, &s;eemed to have a proper influence upon the na|tives, who were now very tractable and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive, and behaved with much civility to the people in the long-boat, which was again di&s;|patched into the bay to fi&s;h, but with little &s;uc|ce&s;s; the Indians however brought great quan|tities of fi&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed and dried; and though they were very indifferent, they were purcha&s;ed, that trade might not be di&s;couraged. In a word, the natives now treated the Engli&s;h with great ho&s;pitality; a large &s;upply of wood and
<PB N="340" REF="359">
good water was obtained, and the &s;hip, being very foul, was heeled, and her bottom &s;crubbed in the bay.</P>
<P>November the 8th the &s;hip was vi&s;ited by &s;e|veral canoes, in one of which was Tojava, who perceiving two &s;trange canoes paddling from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, &s;uddenly turned about, and acquainted the Captain that he was under apprehen&s;ions, the people in them were &s;ome of the freebooters, but he &s;oon found his mi&s;take, and returned to the &s;hip. The Indians &s;upplied the &s;hip's crew with as much excellent fi&s;h, re|&s;embling mackrel, as was &s;ufficient for all their dinners, for which they gave them &s;ome pieces of cloth.</P>
<P>A great variety of plants were this day col|lected by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; they had never ob&s;erved any of the kind before. The&s;e gentlemen remained on &s;hore till near dark, when they ob&s;erved the manner of the natives di&s;po&s;ing of them&s;elves during the night. They lay under &s;ome bu&s;hes; the men neare&s;t the &s;ea in a &s;emicircular form, and the women and children the mo&s;t di&s;tant from it; their arms were placed again&s;t trees very near them, to defend them&s;elves in ca&s;e of a &s;urprize from the freebooters. They had no king, who&s;e &s;overeignty they acknowledged, which was a circum&s;tance unparalleled on any other parts of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="360">Early in the morning of the 9th, &s;everal ca|noes brought a prodigious quantity of mack|rel, one &s;ort of which was no way different from the mackrel caught on our coa&s;t. The&s;e canoes were &s;ucceeded by many others, equally well loaded with the &s;ame &s;ort of fi&s;h; and the cargoes purcha&s;ed were &s;o great, that when &s;alted, they might be con&s;idered as a month's provi&s;ion for the whole &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>This being a very clear day, the a&s;tronomer (Mr. Green) and the other gentlemen landed to ob&s;erve the Tran&s;it of Mercury, and whil&s;t the ob&s;ervation was making, a large canoe, with various commodities on board, came along-&s;ide the &s;hip; and Mr. Gore, the officer who had then the command, being de&s;irous of en|couraging them to traffick, produced a piece of Otaheitean cloth, of more value than any they had yet &s;een, which was immediately &s;eized by one of the Indians, who ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed either to return it, or give any thing in ex|change; he paid dearly however for his teme|rity, being &s;hot dead on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>The death of this young Indian alarmed all the re&s;t; they fled with great precipitancy, and for the pre&s;ent could not be induced to renew their traffick with the Engli&s;h. But when the Indians on &s;hore had heard the particulars re|lated by Tojava, who greatly condemned the conduct of the decea&s;ed, they &s;eemed to think
<PB N="342" REF="361">
that he merited his fate. His name proved to be Otirreeoonooe.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action happened, as has been men|tioned, whil&s;t the ob&s;ervation was making of the Tran&s;it of Mercury, when the weather was &s;o favourable, that the whole Tran&s;it was viewed without a cloud intervening. Mr. Green made the ob&s;ervation of the ingre&s;s, whil&s;t Captain Cook was engaged in a&s;certaining the time, by taking the &s;un's attitude. The Tran|&s;it commenced at 7 hours, 20 min. 58 &s;ec. by Mr. Green's ob&s;ervation the internal contact was at 12 hours, 8 min. 57 &s;ec. the external at 12 hours, 9 min. 54 &s;ec. the latitude 30 deg. 48 min. 5 &s;ec. In con&s;equence of this ob|&s;ervation having been made here, this bay was called <HI>Mercury Bay.</HI></P>
<P>On the 10th Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the Captain went in boats to in&s;pect a large river that runs into the bay. They found it broader &s;ome miles within than at the mouth, and in|ter&s;ected into a number of &s;treams, by &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, which were covered with trees. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river the gentlemen &s;hot &s;ome &s;hags, which proved very good eating. The &s;hore abounded with fi&s;h of various kinds, &s;uch as cockles, clams and oy&s;ters; and here were al&s;o ducks, &s;hags, &s;eapies and curlieus, with other wild fowl in great plenty. At the mouth of the river there was good anchorage in five fathom water. The gentlemen were
<PB N="343" REF="362">
received with great ho&s;pitality by the inha|bitants of a little village, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river. There are the remains of a fort called Eppah, in a penin&s;ula that projects into the river, and it was well calculated for de|fending a &s;mall number again&s;t a greater force. From the remains, it neverthele&s;s &s;eemed to have been taken and partly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The Indians &s;up before &s;un-&s;et, when they eat fi&s;h and birds baked or roa&s;ted; they roa&s;t them upon a &s;tick, &s;tuck in the ground near the fire, and bake them in the manner the dog was baked, which the gentlemen ate at King George's I&s;land.</P>
<P>A female mourner was pre&s;ent at one of their &s;uppers; &s;he was &s;eated upon the ground, and wept ince&s;&s;antly, at the &s;ame time repeating &s;ome &s;entences in a doleful manner, but which Tupia could not explain; at the termination of each period &s;he cut her&s;elf with a &s;hell upon her brea&s;t, her hands or her face; notwith&s;tand|ing this &s;hocking, bloody &s;pectacle greatly affect-the gentlemen pre&s;ent, yet all the Indians who &s;at by her, except one, were quite unmoved. The gentlemen &s;aw &s;ome, who from the depth of their &s;cars mu&s;t, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, have wounded them&s;elves &s;till more violently.</P>
<P>November 11, great plenty of oy&s;ters were procured from a bed which had been di&s;cover|ed, and they proved exceedingly good. Next day the &s;hip was vi&s;ited by two canoes, with
<PB N="344" REF="363">
unknown Indians; after &s;ome invitation they came on board, and they all trafficked without any fraud.</P>
<P>Two fortified villages being de&s;cried, the Captain, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, went to examine them: the &s;malle&s;t was roman|tically &s;ituated upon a rock, which was arched; this village did not con&s;i&s;t of above five or &s;ix hou&s;es, fenced round. There was but one path, which was very narrow, that conducted to it. The gentlemen were invited by the inhabitants to pay them a vi&s;it, but not having time to &s;pare, they took another route, after making pre&s;ents to the females. A body of men, wo|men and children now approached the gentle|men, who proved to be the inhabitants of ano|ther town, which they propo&s;ed vi&s;iting. They gave many te&s;timonials of their friendly di&s;po|&s;itions, among others they uttered the word <HI>Heromai,</HI> which, according to Tupia's interpre|tation, implied Peace, and appeared much &s;a|tisfied, when informed the gentlemen intended vi&s;iting their habitations. Their town was named <HI>Wharretouwa</HI>; it is &s;eated on a point of land over the &s;ea, on the north &s;ide of the bay; it was paled round, and defended by a double ditch. Within the ditch a &s;tage is erected for defending the place in ca&s;e of an attack; near this &s;tage, which they call <HI>Porava,</HI> quantities of darts and &s;tones are depo&s;ited to be in readine&s;s to repel the a&s;&s;ailants. There is another &s;tage
<PB N="345" REF="364">
to command the path that leads to the town, and there are al&s;o &s;ome outworks. Upon the whole, the place &s;eemed calculated to hold out a con&s;iderable time again&s;t an enemy armed with no other weapons than tho&s;e of the inhabi|tants. It appeared however deficient in water for a &s;iege. They eat in&s;tead of bread fern root, which was here in great plenty, with dried fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Very little land is here cultivated, &s;weet po|tatoes and yams being the only vegetables they found. There are two rocks near the foot of this fortification, both &s;eparated from the main land; they are very &s;mall, neverthele&s;s they are not without dwelling-hou&s;es and little fortifica|tions. They throw &s;tones in their engagements with their hands, being de&s;titute of a &s;ling, and tho&s;e and lances are their only mi&s;&s;ile weapons; they have, be&s;ides the <HI>Pattoo Pattoo,</HI> already de&s;cribed, a &s;taff about five feet in length, and another &s;horter.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed from this bay, after taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of the King of Great Britain, on the 15th of November; Tojava, who vi&s;ited them in his canoe ju&s;t before their departure, &s;aid he &s;hould, as &s;oon as the Eng|li&s;h were gone, prepare to retire to his fort, as the relations of Otirrecoonooe had menaced to take his life, as a forfeit for that of the decea&s;|ed, Tojava being judged partial in this affair to the Engli&s;h. A number of i&s;lands of diffe|rent &s;izes appeared towards the north-we&s;t,
<PB N="346" REF="365">
which were named <HI>Mercury I&s;lands.</HI> Mercury bay lies in latitude 36 deg. 47 min. &s;outh; longitude 184 deg. 4 min. we&s;t, and has a &s;mall entrance at its mouth. On account of the number of oy&s;ters found in the river, the Cap|tain gave it the name of <HI>Oy&s;ter river. Mangrove river</HI> (which the Captain &s;o called from the great number of tho&s;e trees that grew near it) is the mo&s;t &s;ecure place for &s;hipping, being at the head of the bay. The north-we&s;t &s;ide of this bay and river is much more fertile than the ea&s;t &s;ide. The inhabitants, though numerous, have no plantations; their canoes are very in|differently con&s;tructed, and are no way orna|mented; they lie under continual apprehen|&s;ions of Teratu, being con&s;idered by him as rebels.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;hore iron &s;and is in plenty to be found, which proves that there are mines of that metal up the country, it being brought down by a rivulet from thence.</P>
<P>On the 18th, in the morning, the Endeavour &s;teered between the main, and an i&s;land which &s;eemed very fertile, and as exten&s;ive as Uli Etea. Many canoes filled with Indians came along-&s;ide, and the Indians &s;ung their war &s;ong, but the Endeavour's people paying them no at|tention, they threw a volley of &s;tones, and then paddled away; but they pre&s;ently returned and renewed their in&s;ults. Tupia &s;poke to them, making u&s;e of his old argument, that inevita|ble
<PB N="347" REF="366">
de&s;truction would en&s;ue if they per&s;i&s;ted; they an&s;wered with brandi&s;hing their weapons, intimating, at the &s;ame time, that if the Engli&s;h dared to come on &s;hore they would de&s;troy them all. Tupia &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in expo&s;tulating with them, but to no purpo&s;e; and they &s;oon gave another volley of &s;tones; but upon a mu&s;ket being fired at one of their boats, they made a precipitate retreat.</P>
<P>In the evening they ca&s;t anchor in 23 fathom, and early the next morning they &s;ailed up an inlet. Soon after two canoes came off, and &s;ome of the Indians came on board; they claimed an acquaintance with Tojava, and knew Tupia's name; and after they had received &s;ome pre|&s;ents they retired peaceably.</P>
<P>The Endeavour was now in the bay, called by the natives Ooahaouragee, and Captain Cook, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, &amp;c. went in the boats to the bottom of the bay to examine it, and they did not return till next morning. They had been up a fre&s;h water ri|ver, at the bottom of the bay, in three fathoms water, which would make a good harbour. They met with an Indian town, and a hippah, or place of refuge, the inhabitants of which invited them to land, and gave them a friendly reception. At the entrance of a wood they met with a tree ninety-eight feet high from the ground to the fir&s;t branch, quite &s;trait, and nineteen feet in circumference; and they found &s;till lar|ger
<PB N="348" REF="367">
trees of the &s;ame kind as they advanced into the wood. The Captain called this river THAMES, being not unlike our river of that name. They al&s;o found &s;everal young cabbage trees, and a new &s;pecies of the palm-nut, or <HI>Pardanus.</HI></P>
<P>Captain Cook weighed anchor the &s;ame after|noon, &s;ailing down the river with the tide, the wind blowing fre&s;h from north north-we&s;t; the next morning the flood obliged him to ca&s;t an|chor again; and the Captain, with Dr Solan|der, went on &s;hore to the we&s;t, but made no ob&s;ervations worth relating. The &s;hip, at their departure from it, was &s;urrounded with canoes, which induced Mr. Banks to remain on board, that he might trade with the Indians. The chief object of the&s;e people was paper, for which they exchanged their arms and cloaths, and took no unfair advantages. Though the traders were hone&s;t in their dealings, there was one among&s;t them, who took a fancy to a half-minute gla&s;s, but was detected in &s;ecreting it, and he was puni&s;hed with the cato'nine tails. The other Indians endeavoured to &s;ave him from this puni&s;hment; but being oppo&s;ed, they got their arms from the canoes, and &s;ome of the people in them attempted to get on board. Mr. Banks and Tupia now coming upon deck, the Indians applied to Tupia; but he having no influence upon Mr. Hicks, the commanding officer, informed them of the nature of the of|fender's
<PB N="349" REF="368">
intended puni&s;hment, which pacified them, as they imagined he was going to be put to death. The criminal not only received twelve la&s;hes, but afterwards a drubbing from an old man, who was thought to be his father. The canoes immediately went off, the Indians &s;ay|ing, they &s;hould be afraid to return again on board. Tupia, however, had &s;o much influ|ence over them as to bring them back; but they &s;eemed to have lo&s;t that confidence, which they had before repo&s;ed in the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 23d the wind being &s;till again&s;t them, they were obliged to tide it down the river, anchoring between tides; they pa&s;&s;ed a point of land, which the Captain called <HI>Point Rodney,</HI> and which is the north-we&s;t extremity of the river. As they could not approach the land, on account of the wind, they had but a di&s;tant view of the main for a cour&s;e of near thirty miles. Captain Cook comprehended, under the name of the River Thames, the whole bay; and the promontory at the north-ea&s;t extremity, he called Cape Colville, in honour of the peer of that name. This cape is in latitude 36 deg. 26 min. longitude 194 deg. 27 min. it is di&s;tin|gui&s;hable at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance by a very high rock. The river rans &s;outh by ea&s;t from the &s;outh point of this cape; it is, in the nar|rowe&s;t parts, at lea&s;t three leagues over for near fourteen leagues, when it becomes narrower. It was thought to contain fi&s;h in abundance, as
<PB N="350" REF="369">
there appeared many implements nece&s;&s;ary for fi&s;hing; the water was in &s;ome places twenty-&s;ix fathoms deep, and gradually dimini&s;hed. There are &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands within cape Col|ville, which appear to form tolerable harbours. There are al&s;o i&s;lands towards the we&s;tern &s;hore. The anchorage is good in all parts of the bay, which is defended from the &s;ea by a number of &s;mall i&s;lands, which Captain Cook named <HI>Bar|rier I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>The circumjacent country, which is pretty exten&s;ive, appeared to be but thinly inhabited; the natives are a &s;tout and active people, and are painted red all over: their canoes were or|namented with carving, and were con&s;tructed upon a good model.</P>
<P>On the 24th, they &s;till continued &s;teering a|long the &s;hore, between the i&s;lands and the main, and in the evening anchored in an open bay, in about fourteen fathoms water. Here they caught a large number of fi&s;h of the &s;ci|enne, or bream kind; from which the Captain named this <HI>Bream Bay,</HI> and the extreme points of it <HI>Bream Head.</HI> There are numbers of rocks off this bay, which were called the <HI>Hen and Chickens</HI>; it is &s;ituated in latitude 35 deg. 46 min. &s;eventeen leagues north-we&s;t of cape Colville. There is an extent of land of about thirty miles between Point Rodney and Bream Head; it is woody and low. No inhabitants were vi&s;ible, but from the fires perceived at
<PB N="351" REF="370">
night, the gentlemen concluded it was inha|bited.</P>
<P>On the 25th, early in the morning, the Endea|vour &s;ailed out of the bay, keeping to the north|ward near the &s;hore. Some i&s;lands were &s;oon af|ter di&s;covered, about ten miles to the north-north-ea&s;t, which they called the <HI>Poor Knights</HI>; upon the&s;e i&s;lands there were &s;ome hou&s;es, and a few towns that appeared fortified, and the land round them &s;eemed cultivated. Towards night &s;everal canoes, with a number of Indians, came up to the &s;hip, and &s;ome came on board. Two of the Chiefs received pre&s;ents, and told the gentlemen, that they had had an account of the arrival of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts. After their departure other Indians came up to trade, and &s;oon began their u&s;ual fraudulent practices; the gentlemen had recour&s;e to the old remedy of firing &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot, and a round &s;hot, which &s;oon put them to flight.</P>
<P>Sunday the 26th, Captain Cook continued his cour&s;e &s;lowly along the &s;hore to the north. This day two canoes came up, and &s;ome of the Indians came on board, when they trafficked very fairly. Two larger canoes &s;oon after fol|lowed them, and coming up to the &s;hip, the people in them hailed the others, when they conferred together, and afterwards came along-&s;ide of the &s;hip. The la&s;t two canoes were finely ornamented with carving, and the people, who appeared to be of higher rank,
<PB N="352" REF="371">
were armed with various weapons; they held in high e&s;timation their <HI>Patoo Patoos,</HI> which were made of &s;tone and whalebone, and they had ribs of whale, with ornaments of dog's hair, which were very curious. The&s;e people were of a darker complexion than tho&s;e to the &s;outhward, and their faces were &s;tained blacker, with what they call <HI>Amoco</HI>; and their thighs were &s;triped with it, very &s;mall inter&s;tices of the fle&s;h being left vi&s;ible. Though they all u&s;ed the black Amoco, they applied it to different parts, and in various forms. Mo&s;t of them had the figure of volutes on their lips, and one woman in particular was curiou&s;ly marked upon various parts of her body. The&s;e Indians &s;eemed the &s;uperiors of the others, they were neverthele&s;s not free from the vice of pilfering, for one of them having agreed to barter a weapon for a piece of cloth, he was no &s;ooner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cloth, than he paddled away without paying the price of it; but a mu&s;quet being fired, he came back and returned the cloth. All the canoes then returned a&s;hore.</P>
<P>The Endeavour pa&s;&s;ed a remarkable point of land which the Captain called <HI>Cape Bret,</HI> in honour of the baronet of that name: this cape is much higher than any of the adjacent land. Within a mile to the north-ea&s;t by north is a curious rocky i&s;land; it is arched, and has a plea&s;ing effect at a di&s;tance. The natives call this <HI>Cape Motugogogo:</HI> it lies in latitude 35 deg.
<PB N="353" REF="372">
10 min. 30 &s;ec. &s;outh; and longitude 185 deg. 23 min. we&s;t. It forms a bay to the we&s;t, which contains many &s;mall i&s;lands, and Cap|tain Cook named the point at the north-we&s;t entrance <HI>Point Pococke.</HI> There are many vil|lages on the main as well as on the i&s;lands, which appeared well inhabited, and &s;everal canoes, filled with Indians, made to the &s;hip, and after coming along-&s;ide to trade, &s;hewed the &s;ame itch for cheating as the others. One of the mid&s;hipmen was &s;o nettled at being impo&s;ed upon, that he had recour&s;e to a whim&s;ical ex|pedient by way of revenge; taking a fi&s;h|ing line, he threw the lead with &s;o much dexterity, that the hook caught the Indian who had impo&s;ed upon him by the buttocks, when the line breaking, the hook remained in his po&s;teriors. The&s;e Indians were &s;trong and well proportioned; their hair was black, and tied up in a bunch &s;tuck with feathers: the Chiefs among them had garments made of fine cloth, ornamented with dog's &s;kin; and they were tataowed like tho&s;e who had la&s;t appeared.</P>
<P>On the 27th the Endeavour was among a num|ber of &s;mall i&s;lands, from which &s;everal canoes came off; but the Indians, from their frantic ge&s;tures, &s;eemed di&s;ordered in their minds; they threw their fi&s;h into the &s;hip by handfuls, without demanding any thing by way of barter. Some other canoes al&s;o came up, who &s;aluted the &s;hip with &s;tones. One of the Indians, who
<PB N="354" REF="373">
was particularly active, threw a &s;tick at one of the Endeavour's men. It was then judged time to bring them to rea&s;on, and a mu&s;quet, with &s;mall &s;hot was fired at him, when he fell down in the cance. A general terror was now &s;pread among&s;t them, and they all made a very pre|cipitate retreat. Among the fi&s;h obtained from the&s;e canoes, were <HI>Cavalles</HI> in great plenty, and for this rea&s;on the Captain called the&s;e i&s;lands by the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days the wind was &s;o very unfavour|able, that the ve&s;&s;el rather lo&s;t than gained ground; on the 29th, having weathered Cape Bret, they bore away to leeward, and got into a large bay, where they anchored on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of &s;everal i&s;lands, and &s;uddenly came into four fathom and a half water. Upon &s;ounding, they found they had got upon a bank, and accord|ingly weighed and dropped over it, and an|chored again in ten fathoms and a half; after which the &s;hip was &s;urrounded by thirty-three large canoes, containing near three hundred Indians all armed. Some of them were ad|mitted on board, and Captain Cook gave a piece of broad cloath to one of the Chiefs, and &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents to the others. They traded peaceably for &s;ome time, being terrified at the fire arms, the effect of which they were not un|acquainted with; but whil&s;t the Captain was at dinner, on a &s;ignal given by one of their Chiefs, all the Indians quitted the &s;hip, and they
<PB N="355" REF="374">
attempted to tow away the buoy; a mu&s;quet was now fired over them, but it produced no effect; &s;mall &s;hot was then fired at them, but it did not reach them. A mu&s;quet, loaded with ball, was therefore ordered to be fired, and <HI>Otegoowgoow</HI> (&s;on of one of the Chiefs) was wounded in the thigh by it, which induced them immediately to throw the buoy overboard. To complete their confu&s;ion a round &s;hot was fired, which reached the &s;hore, and as &s;oon as they landed they ran in &s;earch of it. If the&s;e In|dians had been under any kind of military di&s;|cipline, they might have proved a much more formidable enemy; but acting thus, without any plan or regulation, they only expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to the annoyance of fire arms, whil&s;t they could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed in any of their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The Captain, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander landed upon the i&s;land, and the Indians in the canoes &s;oon after came on &s;hore. The gentle|men were now in a &s;mall cove, and they were pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by near four hundred armed Indians; but the Captain not &s;u&s;pecting any ho&s;tile de&s;ign on the part of the natives, remained peaceably di&s;po&s;ed. The gentlemen marching towards them, drew a line, intimating that they were not to pa&s;s it; they did not in|fringe upon this boundary for &s;ome time, but at length they &s;ung the &s;ong of defiance, and began to dance, whil&s;t a party attempted to
<PB N="356" REF="375">
draw the Endeavour's boats on &s;hore; the&s;e &s;ignals for an attack being immediately follow|ed by the Indians breaking in upon the line, the gentlemen judged it time to defend them|&s;elves, and accordingly the Captain fired his mu&s;quet, loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, which was &s;econded by Mr. Banks di&s;charging his piece, and two of the men followed his example. This threw the Indians into confu&s;ion, and they retreated; but were rallied again by one of their Chiefs, who &s;houted and waved his patoo patoo. The Doctor now pointed his mu&s;quet at this hero, and hit him; this &s;topt his career, and he took to flight with the other Indians. They retired to an eminence in a collective bo|dy, and &s;eemed dubious whether they &s;hould return to the charge. They were now at too great a di&s;tance for ball to reach them; but the&s;e operations being ob&s;erved from the &s;hip, &s;he brought her broad-&s;ide to bear, and by fir|ing over them &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them. The In|dians had in this &s;kirmi&s;h two of their people wounded, but none killed. Peace being thus re&s;tored, the gentlemen began to gather celery and other herbs; but &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome of the natives were lurking about with evil de&s;igns, they repaired to a cave, which was at a &s;mall di&s;tance; here they found the Chief, who had that day received a pre&s;ent from the Cap|tain; he came forth with his wife and brother, and &s;olicited their clemency. It appeared, that
<PB N="357" REF="376">
one of the wounded Indians was a bro|ther of this Chief, who was under great anxiety le&s;t the wound &s;hould prove mortal; but his grief was in a great degree alleviated, when he was made acquainted with the different effects of &s;mall &s;hot and ball; he was at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured, that upon any future ho&s;tilities being committed ball would be u&s;ed. This interview terminated very cordially, after &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents were made to the Chief and his com|panions.</P>
<P>The prudence of the gentlemen upon this occa&s;ion, cannot be much commended. Had the&s;e four hundred Indians boldly ru&s;hed in up|on them at once with their weapons, the mu&s;|quetry could have done very little execution; but &s;uppo&s;ing twenty or thirty of the Indians had been wounded, for it does not appear their pieces were loaded with ball, but only &s;mall &s;hot, there would have remained a &s;ufficient number to have ma&s;&s;acred them, as it appears they do not give any quarter, and none could have been expected upon this occa&s;ion. It is true, when the &s;hip brought her broad-&s;ide to bear, &s;he might have made great havock among&s;t the Indians; but this would have been too late to &s;ave the party on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Being again in their boats, they rowed to ano|ther part of the &s;ame i&s;land, when landing and gaining an eminence, they had a very agreea|ble and romantic view of a great number of
<PB N="358" REF="377">
i&s;lands, well inhabited and cultivated. The in|habitants of an adjacent town approached un|armed, and te&s;tified great humility and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion. Some of the party on &s;hore, who had been very violent for having the Indians pu|ni&s;hed for their fraudulent conduct, were now guilty of tre&s;pa&s;&s;es equally reprehen&s;ible, hav|ing forced into &s;ome of the plantations, and dug up potatoes. The Captain upon this oc|ca&s;ion &s;hewed &s;trict ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing each of the offenders with twelve la&s;hes: one of them being very refractory upon the occa&s;ion, and complaining of the hard&s;hip, thinking an Eng|li&s;hman had a right to plunder an Indian with impunity, was flogged out of this opinion with &s;ix additional la&s;hes. Probably his adding <Q REND="inline">"that in this, he had only followed the exam|ple of his &s;uperiors,"</Q> might have had no little weight in procuring him this la&s;t &s;entence.</P>
<P>It being a dead calm on the 30th, two boats were &s;ent to &s;ound the harbour, and many ca|noes came up, and traded with great probity: the gentlemen went again on &s;hore, and met with a very civil reception from the natives; and this friendly intercour&s;e continued all the time they remained in the bay, which was &s;e|veral days. Being upon a vi&s;it to the old Chief, he &s;hewed them the in&s;truments u&s;ed in tataow|ing, which were very like tho&s;e at Otaheite em|ployed upon the like occa&s;ion. They &s;aw the man who had been wounded by the ball, when
<PB N="359" REF="378">
the attempt was made to carry off the &s;hip's buoy; and though it had gone through the fle&s;hy part of his arm, it did not &s;eem to give him the lea&s;t pain or unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 5th, in the morning, they weighed anchor, but were &s;oon becalmed, and a &s;trong current &s;etting towards the &s;hore, they were driven in with &s;uch rapidity, that they ex|pected every moment to run upon the breakers, which appeared above water not more than a cable's length di&s;tance; they were &s;o near the land, that Tupia, who was totally ignorant of the danger, held a conver&s;ation with the In|dians, who were &s;tanding on the beach. They were happily relieved, however, from this a|larming &s;ituation by a fre&s;h breeze, &s;uddenly &s;pringing up from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The bay which they had left was called the <HI>Bay of I&s;lands,</HI> on account of the numerous i&s;lands it contains; they catched but few fi&s;h while they lay there, but procured great plenty from the natives, who are extremely expert at fi&s;hing, and di&s;play great ingenuity in the form of their nets, which are made of a kind of gra&s;s; they are two or three hundred fathoms in length, and remarkably &s;trong; and they have them in &s;uch plenty, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to go a hundred yards upon the beach, without meeting with numbers lying in heaps. The&s;e people did not appear to be under the government of any particular Chief or Sovereign, and they
<PB N="360" REF="379">
&s;eemed to live in a perfect &s;tate of friend&s;hip, notwith&s;tanding their villages were fortified. According to their ob&s;ervations upon the tides, the flood comes from the &s;outh, and there is a current from the we&s;t.</P>
<P>Dec. 7, Several canoes put off and followed the Endeavour, but a breeze ari&s;ing, Captain Cook did not wait for them: on the 8th they tacked, and &s;tood in for the &s;hore: and on the 9th, they were about &s;even leagues to the we&s;t|ward of the Cavalles, and &s;oon after came to a deep bay, which the Captain named <HI>Doubtle&s;s Bay.</HI> The wind prevented their putting in here, and being &s;oon after becalmed, they were vi|&s;ited by &s;everal canoes from &s;hore, with whom they trafficked. From the&s;e Indians they learnt, they were about two days &s;ail from <HI>Moore When|nua,</HI> where the land changed its &s;hape, and in|&s;tead of extending to the we&s;tward, turned to the &s;outh; and that to the north-north-we&s;t there was an exten&s;ive country, named <HI>Ulima|roah,</HI> where the inhabitants lived upon hogs, which they called <HI>Booah,</HI> and was the &s;ame name given them by the inhabitants of the i&s;lands in the South Seas. They &s;aw upon the coa&s;t &s;e|veral plantations, of the Eaowte, or cloth trees, and &s;ome of the Koomarra. They beat to windward four days, and made but little way. On the 10th, the land appeared low and bar|ren, but was not de&s;titute of inhabitants; the next morning, they &s;tood in with the land,
<PB N="361" REF="380">
which forms a penin&s;ula, and which the Cap|tain named <HI>Knuckle Point.</HI> Another bay, that lies contiguous, Captain Cook called <HI>Sandy Bay,</HI> in the middle of it is a high mountain, which was named <HI>Mount Camel,</HI> on account of its re&s;embling that animal. Several canoes put off, but could not reach the &s;hip, which now tacked and &s;tood to the northward, till the af|ternoon of the 12th, when &s;he &s;tood to the north-ea&s;t. Towards night it began to rain and blow, and in the morning it was &s;o tem|pe&s;tuous, as to &s;plit the main-top-&s;ail, and the fore mizen-top-&s;ails. Early in the morning of the 14th, they &s;aw land to the &s;outhward; and on the 15th, they tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;t|ward; next day they di&s;covered land from the ma&s;t-head to the &s;outh-&s;outh-we&s;t; and on the 16th came off the northern extremity of New Zealand, which the Captain called NORTH CAPE. It lies in latitude 34 deg. 22 min. &s;outh, longi|tude 186 deg. 55 min. we&s;t, and forms the north point of Sandy Bay. Their &s;ituation varied but little till the 24th, when they di&s;co|vered land, which they judged to be the i&s;lands of the Three Kings, though they did not re&s;em|ble the de&s;cription of them in Dalrymple's ac|count. The chief i&s;land is in latitude 34 deg. 12 min. &s;outh, longitude 187 deg. 48 min. we&s;t, between fourteen or fifteen leagues from North Cape. Mr. Banks went out in the &s;mall boat, and caught &s;ome birds that greatly re&s;embled
<PB N="362" REF="381">
gee&s;e, and they were very good eating. On the 27th, it blew very hard from the ea&s;t all day, accompanied with heavy &s;howers of rain, and they brought the &s;hip under a reef main-&s;ail. On the 30th they &s;aw land, bearing north-ea&s;t, which was thought to be Cape Maria Van Diemen, but the &s;ea being very bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;terous, they did not venture to approach it, but tacked a|bout and &s;tood to the north-we&s;t.</P>
<P>January 1, 1770, they tacked and &s;tood to the ea&s;tward, and on the 3d they &s;aw land a|gain; it was high and flat, and tended away to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, beyond the reach of the naked eye. It is remarkable, that the Endeavour was three weeks in making ten leagues to the we&s;t|ward, and that &s;he met with a violent gale of wind in latitude 35 deg. &s;outh, at Mid&s;ummer. On the morning of the 4th they &s;tood along the &s;hore, the coa&s;t appearing &s;andy and barren, dreary and inho&s;pitable; &s;teering northward on the 6th they &s;aw land again, which they ima|gined to be Cape Maria: on the 7th, they had light breezes, and were &s;ometimes becalmed, when they &s;aw a &s;un-fi&s;h, &s;hort and thick in figure, with two large fins, but &s;carce any tail, re&s;embling a &s;hark in colour and &s;ize. They continued &s;teering ea&s;t till the 9th, when they perceived land, and were &s;oon after a-brea&s;t of a point, which Captain Cook named <HI>Woody-head.</HI> From the &s;outh-we&s;t there is a &s;mall i&s;land, which the Captain called <HI>Gannet I&s;land.</HI>
<PB N="363" REF="382">
Another point remarkably high to the ea&s;t-north-ea&s;t, the Captain named <HI>Albetro&s;s Point,</HI> on the north &s;ide of which a bay is formed that promi&s;es good anchorage. At about two leagues di&s;tance from Albetro&s;s Point to the north-ea&s;t, they di&s;covered a remarkable high mountain, equal in height to that of Teneriffe, the &s;um|mit of which was covered with &s;now, and it was named Mount <HI>Egmont.</HI> It is in latitude 39 deg. 16 min. longitude 185 deg. 15 min. we&s;t, and the country round it is plea&s;ant, pre&s;enting an agreeable verdure, inter&s;ected with woods: the coa&s;t forms an exten&s;ive cape, which the Captain likewi&s;e called cape Egmont, in honour of the nobleman of that name. It is about twenty-&s;even leagues to the &s;outh &s;outh-we&s;t of Albetro&s;s Point, having two &s;mall i&s;lands to the north, near a very high point of a conic figure. This day &s;ome very heavy &s;howers of rain fell, accompanied with thunder and lightening. The Captain propo&s;ed careening the &s;hip here, and taking in wood and water; and accordingly, on the 15th, &s;teered for an inlet; when it be|ing almo&s;t a calm, the &s;hip was carried by the current very near the &s;hore, but got clear with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the boats. Whil&s;t this was doing a &s;ea lion made its appearance; it is a very curious creature, and an&s;wers the de&s;crip|tion given of it in Lord An&s;on's Voyage. The Captain &s;ent the pinnace to examine a &s;mall cove that appeared, but &s;oon after recalled her, on
<PB N="364" REF="383">
&s;eeing the natives launch and arm their canoes. The Endeavour anchored in a commodious part of the bay, in &s;ailing towards which &s;pot an Indian town was de&s;cried, when the inhabitants waved their hands, &s;eemingly to invite the En|deavour's people to land. In pa&s;&s;ing the point of the bay, they ob&s;erved an armed centinel on duty, who was twice relieved. Four canoes came from &s;hore to vi&s;it the &s;hip, but none of the Indians would venture on board, except an old man, who &s;eemed of elevated rank: his countrymen took great pains to prevent his coming on board, but they could not divert him from his purpo&s;e, and he was received with the utmo&s;t civility and ho&s;pitality. Tupia and the old man joined no&s;es, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, and after receiving &s;everal pre|&s;ents, he returned to his a&s;&s;ociates, when they began to dance and laugh, and &s;oon after re|tired. The Captain and the other gentlemen now went on &s;hore, where they met with plenty of wood and water, and were very &s;ucce&s;sful in fi&s;hing, catching &s;ome hundred weight in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>On the 16th the Endeavour's people were en|gaged in careening her, when three canoes came off with a great number of Indians, and brought &s;everal of their women with them. This circum&s;tance was judged a favourable pre&s;age of their peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, but they &s;oon gave proofs of the contrary, by attempting

to &s;top the long-boat that was &s;ent on &s;hore for water, when Captain Cook had recour&s;e to the old expedient of firing &s;ome &s;hot, which in|timidated them for the pre&s;ent; but they &s;oon gave fre&s;h proofs of their in&s;idious de&s;igns. One of them &s;natched &s;ome paper from the En|deavour's people who were trading with them, and brandi&s;hing his patoo patoo, put him&s;elf in a threatening po&s;ture; upon which it was judged expedient to fire &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot at him, which wounded him in the knee; this &s;tep put an end to the corre&s;pondence with regard to trade; but Tupia &s;till continued conver&s;ing with them, and making many inquiries concerning the cu|rio&s;ities of New Zealand; he al&s;o a&s;ked them, if they had ever before &s;een a &s;hip of the mag|nitude of the Endeavour; to which they re|plied, they had never &s;een &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el, nor ever heard that one had been upon the coa&s;t, though Ta&s;man certainly touched here, which was only fifteen miles &s;outh of Murderer's bay. There is great plenty of fi&s;h in all the coves of this bay; among others here are cut|tle fi&s;h, large breams, &s;mall grey breams, &s;mall and large baracootas, flying gurnards, hor&s;e mackrel, dog fi&s;h, &s;oles, dabs, mullets, drums, &s;corpenas, or rock fi&s;h, cole fi&s;h, &s;hags, chi|meras, &amp;c. The inhabitants catch their fi&s;h as follows; their net is cylindrical, extended by &s;everal hoops at the bottom, and contracted at the top; the fi&s;h going in to feed upon what
<PB N="366" REF="385">
is put in the net, are caught in great abundance; there are al&s;o birds of various kinds, and in great numbers, particularly parrots, wood pi|geons, water hens, hawks, and many different &s;inging birds. An herb, a &s;pecies of <HI>Philadel|phus,</HI> was u&s;ed here in&s;tead of tea; and a plant, called Teegoomme, re&s;embling rug cloaks, &s;erved the natives for garments. The environs of the cove where the Endeavour lay is covered entirely with wood, and the &s;upple jacks are &s;o numerous, that it is with difficulty pa&s;&s;engers can pur&s;ue their way; here is a numerous &s;and-fly that is very di&s;agreeable. The tops of many of the hills are covered with fern. The air of the country is very moi&s;t, and has &s;ome qualities that promote putrefaction, as birds that had been &s;hot but a few hours were found with maggots in them. The women who accompanied the men in the canoes wore a head-dre&s;s, which the gentlemen had no where met with before. It was compo&s;ed of black feathers, tied in a bunch on the top of the head, which greatly increa&s;ed its height. The manner of their di&s;po&s;ing of their dead is very different to what is practi&s;ed in the South-&s;ea i&s;lands, they tie a large &s;tone to the body, and throw it into the &s;ea: the gentlemen &s;aw the body of a woman which had been di&s;po&s;ed of this way, but which by &s;ome accident had di&s;|engaged it&s;elf from the &s;tone, floating upon the water. The Captain, Mr. Banks, and the
<PB N="367" REF="386">
Doctor vi&s;ited another cove, about two miles from the &s;hip. There was a family of Indians who were greatly alarmed at the approach of the gentlemen, all running away except one; but upon Tupia's conver&s;ing with him the others returned. They found, by the provi&s;ions of this family, that they were cannibals, here being &s;everal human bones that had been lately dre&s;&s;ed and picked; and it appeared, that a &s;hort time before, &s;ix of their enemies having fallen into their hands, they had killed four and eaten them, and that the other two were drowned in endea|vouring to make their e&s;cape. They made no &s;ecret of this abominable cu&s;tom, but an&s;wered Tupia, who was de&s;ired to a&s;certain the fact, with great compo&s;ure, that his conjectures were ju&s;t, that they were the bones of a man, and te&s;tified by &s;igns, that they thought human fle&s;h delicious food. Upon being a&s;ked, why they had not eaten the body of the woman that had been &s;een floating upon the water? They replied, &s;he had died of a di&s;order, and that moreover &s;he was related to them, and they never ate any but their enemies. Upon Mr. Banks's &s;till te&s;tifying &s;ome doubts concerning the fact, one of the Indians drew the bone of a man's arm through his mouth, and this gen|tleman had the curio&s;ity to bring it away with him. There was a woman in this family who&s;e arms and legs were cut in a &s;hocking
<PB N="368" REF="387">
manner, and it appeared &s;he had thus wounded her&s;elf, becau&s;e her hu&s;band had lately been killed and eaten by the enemy.</P>
<P>Some of the Indians brought four &s;kulls one day to &s;ell, which they rated at a very high price. The brains had been taken out, and probably eaten, but the &s;calp and hair remain|ed. They &s;eemed to have been dried by fire, in order to pre&s;erve them from putrefaction. The gentlemen likewi&s;e &s;aw the bail of a canoe, which was made of a human &s;kull. In a word, their ideas were &s;o horrid and brutal, that they &s;eemed to pride them&s;elves upon their cruelty and barbarity, and took a peculiar plea&s;ure in &s;hew|ing the manner in which they killed their enemies, it being con&s;idered as very meritori|ous to be expert at this de&s;truction. The me|thod u&s;ed was to knock them down with their patoo patoos, and then rip up their bellies.</P>
<P>An amazing number of birds u&s;ually began their melody about two o'clock in the morning, and &s;erenaded the gentlemen till the time of their ri&s;ing. This harmony was very agreea|ble, as the &s;hip lay at a convenient di&s;tance from the &s;hore, to hear it. The&s;e feathered choiri&s;ters, like the Engli&s;h nightingales, never &s;ing in the day time.</P>
<P>On the 17th, the &s;hip was vi&s;ited by a ca|noe from the hippah, or village; it contain|ed, among others, the aged Indian, of &s;upe|rior

<PB N="369" REF="389">
di&s;tinction, who had fir&s;t vi&s;ited the Engli&s;h upon their arrival. In a conference which Tupia had with him, he te&s;tified his apprehen|&s;ions, that their enemies would very &s;oon vi&s;it them, and repay the compliment, for killing and eating the four men.</P>
<P>On the 18th they received no vi&s;it from the Indians, but going out in the pinnace to in|&s;pect the bay, they &s;aw a &s;ingle man in a canoe, fi&s;hing in the manner already de&s;cribed. It was remarkable, that this man did not pay the lea&s;t attention to the people in the pinnace, but continued to pur&s;ue his employment even when they came along-&s;ide of him, without once looking at them. Some of the Endea|vour's people being on &s;hore found three hu|man hip bones, clo&s;e to an oven: the&s;e were brought on board, as well as the hair of a man's head, which was found in a tree. The next day a forge was &s;et up to repair the iron work, and &s;ome Indians vi&s;ited the &s;hip with plenty of fi&s;h, which they bartered very fairly for nails.</P>
<P>On the 20th, Mr. Banks purcha&s;ed of the old Indian a man's head, which he &s;eemed very unwilling to part with; the &s;kull had been frac|tured by a blow, and the brains were extracted, and like the others it was pre&s;erved from putre|faction. From the care with which they kept the&s;e &s;kulls, and the reluctance with which they bartered any, it was imagined they were con&s;i|dered
<PB N="370" REF="390">
as trophies of war, and te&s;timonials of their valour. In this day's excur&s;ion they did not meet with a &s;ingle native; the ground on every &s;ide was quite uncultivated; but they di&s;covered a very good harbour. The &s;ucceed|ing day the &s;hip's company were allowed to go on &s;hore for their amu&s;ement, and the gentle|men employed them&s;elves in fi&s;hing, in which they were very &s;ucce&s;sful. Some of the com|pany in their excur&s;ion met with fortifications that had not the advantage of an elevated &s;itu|ation, but were &s;urrounded by two or three wide ditches, with a draw-bridge, which, tho' &s;imple in its &s;tructure, is capable of an&s;wering every purpo&s;e again&s;t the arms of the natives. Within the&s;e ditches is a fence, made with &s;takes, fixed in the earth. A deci&s;ive conque&s;t or victory over the be&s;ieged occa&s;ions an entire depopulation of that di&s;trict, as the vanqui&s;hed, not only tho&s;e who are killed, but the pri&s;oners likewi&s;e are devoured by the victors. From what has been related by &s;uch unque&s;tionable authority, there can remain no doubt with the unprejudiced reader, that the inhabitants of this part of the globe are cannibals. There are, indeed, &s;ome clo&s;et travellers, who treat every thing as vi&s;ionary, that they have not been eye-wit|ne&s;&s;es of, and therefore di&s;believe all they read, related by real travellers, that does not &s;quare with their own notions and ideas; but as it may
<PB N="371" REF="391">
be impo&s;&s;ible to convince the&s;e &s;ceptical readers, we &s;hall leave them to amu&s;e them&s;elves with their doubts and objections.</P>
<P>The 22d was employed by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander in collecting of plants, whil&s;t Captain Cook made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the main land on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the inlet, which con&s;i&s;ted of a chain of high hills, and formed part of the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight; the oppo&s;ite &s;ide extended far to the ea&s;t. He al&s;o di&s;covered a village, and many hou&s;es that had been de&s;erted, and another village that appeared to be inhabited. There were many &s;mall i&s;lands round the coa&s;t that &s;eemed entirely barren, and what few inhabi|tants were upon them then lived principally upon fi&s;h. On the 24th they vi&s;ited a hippah, which was &s;ituated on a very high rock, hollow under|neath, forming a fine natural arch, one &s;ide of which joined to the land, and the other ro&s;e out of the &s;ea. The inhabitants received the gen|tlemen with great civility, and very readily &s;hewed them every thing that was curious. This hippah was partly &s;urrounded with a palli&s;ade, and it had a fighting &s;tage like that already de&s;cribed. Here they met with a cro&s;s re&s;embling a crucifix, which was ornamented with feathers, and which was erected as a mo|nument for a decea&s;ed per&s;on; but they could not learn how his body was di&s;po&s;ed of. From a conver&s;ation that Tupia had with the&s;e
<PB N="372" REF="392">
people, a di&s;covery was made, that an officer being in a boat near this village, and &s;ome canoes coming off made him imagine they had ho&s;tile de&s;igns, and he fired upon them with ball, which made them retire with much precipita|tion, but they could not effect their retreat be|fore one of them was wounded. What made this ra&s;h action the more to be lamented was, that the Indians afterwards gave every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urance that their intentions, upon this occa|&s;ion, were entirely friendly.</P>
<P>On the 25th the Captain, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander went on &s;hore to &s;hoot, when they met with a numerous family, who were among the creeks catching fi&s;h: they behaved very civilly, and received &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents from the gentlemen. The next day they went to take a view of the &s;treight, that pa&s;&s;es between the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern &s;eas: they accordingly attained the &s;ummit of a hill, but it being cloudy weather, they could not &s;ee at any con|&s;iderable di&s;tance. Here, however, they e|rected a pile, leaving in it mu&s;ket balls, &s;mall &s;hot, beads, &amp;c. as a te&s;timonial of this place having been vi&s;ited by Europeans. Upon their return they met with another Indian fa|mily, who behaved to them very re&s;pectfully, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in procuring them water. They al&s;o vi&s;ited another hippah upon a rock that was almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; it con&s;i&s;ted of about ninety
<PB N="373" REF="393">
hou&s;es, and had a fighting &s;tage. The gentle|men made the inhabitants &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents, and they in return furni&s;hed them with dried fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;hip's company were, on the 27th and 28th, engaged in making nece&s;&s;ary repairs, and getting her ready for &s;ea. The next day they were vi&s;ited by Topoa, their old friend, and &s;ome other Indians. They &s;aid, that the man who had received a wound from the officer, near the hippah, was dead; but this a&s;&s;ertion proved afterwards groundle&s;s. The Doctor and Mr. Banks often went on &s;hore whil&s;t the &s;hip was preparing for &s;ea, and made &s;everal ob&s;erva|tions upon the coa&s;t to the north-we&s;t: they perceived an i&s;land, at about ten leagues di&s;|tance, between which and the main there were &s;everal &s;maller i&s;lands. The Captain al&s;o went on &s;hore, and erected another pyramid of &s;tones, in which he put &s;ome bullets, beads, &amp;c. as before, with the addition of a piece of &s;ilver coin, and placed part of an old pendant on the top, to di&s;tingui&s;h it. Some of the people who had been &s;ent out to gather celery, met with &s;everal of the natives, among whom were &s;ome women, who&s;e hu&s;bands had lately fallen into the hands of the enemy, and they were cutting many parts of their body in the mo&s;t &s;hocking manner with &s;harp &s;tones, in te&s;timony of their exce&s;&s;ive grief. What made this ceremony ap|pear ridiculous as well as &s;hocking, was, that
<PB N="374" REF="394">
the male Indians, who were with them, paid not the lea&s;t attention to it, but with the great|e&s;t unconcern imaginable, employed them&s;elves in repairing &s;ome empty huts upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 30th, two po&s;ts were erect|ed, in&s;cribed with the &s;hip's name, &amp;c. as u&s;ual; one was placed at the watering-place, with the Union flag upon it, and the other in the &s;ame manner, on the i&s;land of <HI>Motuara</HI>; and the in|habitants being informed, that the&s;e po&s;ts were meant as memorials of the Endeavour having touched at this place promi&s;ed never to de&s;troy them. The Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">n then named this inlet <HI>Queen Charlotte</HI>'s <HI>Sound</HI>; and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name, and for the u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty, and a bottle of wine was drank to the Queen's health.</P>
<P>The Captain made the old man &s;ome pre&s;ents; among others there were a &s;ilver three-pence and &s;ome &s;pike nails, with the broad arrow upon them. Topaa being que&s;tioned concerning a pa&s;&s;age into the ea&s;tern &s;ea, an&s;wered, that there certainly was &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age; and he al&s;o informed the Captain, that the land to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the &s;treight, where he then was, con&s;i&s;ted of two i&s;lands, named <HI>Tovy Poennammoo,</HI> and that it would take about two days to &s;ail round them; he added, that there was a third i&s;land to the ea&s;t, called <HI>Eaheinomauwe,</HI> which was of con&s;iderable extent; and that the land contiguous to this inlet was called <HI>Tiera Witte.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="395">Towards night, on the 31&s;t, a bri&s;k gale aro&s;e, attended with heavy &s;howers, and the next morning the weather became &s;o very tem|pe&s;tuous, that the Endeavour had her haw&s;er broke, and &s;everal ca&s;ks of water that had been left on &s;hore were wa&s;hed away with the rain.</P>
<P>The 2d, 3d and 4th of February, were chiefly &s;pent in preparing for their departure, and purcha&s;ing fi&s;h of the natives, who confirmed the accounts that Topoa had given, re&s;pecting an ea&s;tern pa&s;&s;age and the adjacent i&s;lands. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were in the mean while chiefly engaged in collecting &s;eeds and &s;hells of different kinds. They got under &s;ail the 5th, but the wind not continuing, they came again to an anchor. Topaa vi&s;ited the gentlemen again to bid them farewel; and being que&s;tioned, whether he had ever heard that &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el as the Endeavour had touched there, he an&s;wered in the negative; but added, there was a tradition of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el coming from a place called <HI>Ulimaroa</HI> (a di&s;tant country to the north) that there were only four men in her, and that they were all put to death.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and the Doctor went again on &s;hore, in &s;earch of natural curio&s;ities, when they met with a very amiable Indian family, among whom was a widow, and a pretty youth about ten years of age. She had ju&s;t lo&s;t her hu&s;band, and was performing the ceremony of the country upon the occa&s;ion. They behav|ed
<PB N="376" REF="396">
with the utmo&s;t ho&s;pitality and courte&s;y, and endeavoured to prevail with the gentlemen to &s;tay all night, but they expecting the &s;hip to &s;ail, could not accept of the invitation. This family &s;eemed the mo&s;t enlightened and intel|ligent &s;et of Indians the gentlemen had as yet met with, which made them regret they had not fallen into their company before, as they would probably have derived much informa|tion from them.</P>
<P>On the 6th of February, in the morning, the Endeavour &s;ailed out of the bay, which the &s;hip's company, from an abhorrence of the brutal cu&s;tom that prevails here of eating men, called <HI>Cannibal Bay.</HI> They bent their cour&s;e to an opening on the ea&s;t; in the evening, being in the mouth of the &s;treights, they were becalm|ed in latitude 41 deg. &s;outh, longitude 184 deg. 45 min. we&s;t. The two points which form this entrance, were named cape Koomaroo, and point Jack&s;on. The natives call the land about it Totarranue; and the harbour, which the Captain named <HI>Ship Cove,</HI> is very &s;afe and com|modious. A &s;hip may enter it either between Motuara and the i&s;land of Hamote, or between the we&s;tern &s;hore and Motuara. Care, however, mu&s;t be taken to attend to the tides; when there is little wind they flow about nine or ten o'clock at the full and change of the moon, and ri&s;e and fall about &s;even feet and a half, pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treight from the &s;outh ea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="397">The natives about this &s;ound are not above four hundred in number; they are &s;cattered along the coa&s;t, and live upon fern root and fi&s;h; the latter of which was the only com|modity they traded in. They were not en|tirely ignorant of the u&s;e of iron, bartering their fi&s;h for nails, and often giving them the preference to any other trifles that were offered them; they &s;oon rejected paper when they found it was not water proof; nor was the cloth of Otaheite held in much e&s;timation by them; but the cloths of Engli&s;h manufacture they highly valued. The timber here is very good, and fit for almo&s;t all purpo&s;es, except ma&s;ts; be|&s;ides fi&s;h, which is in great plenty, here are &s;hags, and &s;ome other kinds of wild fowl, in abundance.</P>
<P>The Endeavour having left the &s;ound, &s;teered ea&s;tward, and about &s;ix o'clock in the evening they were greatly alarmed at their being carried, by the rapidity of the current, very clo&s;e to one of the two i&s;lands which lie off Cape Koamaroo, at the entrance of the &s;ounds. The &s;hip was in &s;uch imminent dan|ger, that they expected every minute &s;he would be da&s;hed to pieces; but letting go an anchor, and veering one hundred and &s;ixty fathoms of cable, &s;he was brought up, when they were not above two cables length from the rocks: in this &s;ituation they were obliged to wait for the ebb of the tide, which was not till after midnight; at three o'clock in the morn|ing
<PB N="378" REF="398">
they weighed anchor, and a fine breeze &s;pringing up &s;oon after, they were carried through the &s;treight with great velocity. At the entrance of the &s;treight, on the north-&s;ide, there is a &s;mall i&s;land, which was named <HI>Entry I&s;land.</HI> The narrowe&s;t part of this &s;treight, which was called <HI>Cooke's Streight,</HI> is between Cape Tierawitte and Cape Koamaroo; it is about thirteen miles long and fourteen broad; the &s;afe&s;t pa&s;&s;age is on the north-ea&s;t &s;hore, the other being rocky and dangerous. The two ea&s;tern points of the &s;treight Captain Cook named <HI>Cape Palli&s;er</HI> and <HI>Cape Campbell</HI>; the fir&s;t is in latitude 41 deg. 44 min. &s;outh; lon|gitude 183 deg. 45 min. we&s;t; and the latter in latitude 41 deg. 34 min. &s;outh-ea&s;t, and lon|gitude 183 deg. 58 min. we&s;t. The Endea|vour was now about three leagues from land, facing a deep bay, which was called <HI>Cloudy Bay.</HI> Some of the gentlemen on board expre&s;&s;ing a doubt that Eahienomauwe was not an i&s;land, the Endeavour &s;teered &s;outh-ea&s;t, in order to a&s;certain whether it was or not; upon the wind's &s;hifting, &s;he &s;tood ea&s;tward, and &s;teered all night north-ea&s;t by ea&s;t. They were off Cape Palli&s;er next morning (the 8th) when they di&s;|covered that the land reached away to the north-ea&s;t towards Cape Turnagain. Three canoes came off in the afternoon, with &s;everal people in them; they made a good appearance, and their canoes were ornamented like tho&s;e of the
<PB N="379" REF="399">
Indians of the northern coa&s;t. They came on board without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, and behaved very civilly; a mutual exchange of pre&s;ents took place, which was the fir&s;t in&s;tance they met with of &s;uch courte&s;y among any of the Indians. By their a&s;king for <HI>Whow,</HI> which &s;ig|nified nails, it was imagined they had heard of the Endeavour's people from the inhabitants of &s;ome other place where &s;he had touched. They re&s;embled the natives of Tolaga Bay in their dre&s;s. One old man was tataowed in a very remarkable manner; he was likewi&s;e mark|ed with a &s;treak of red paint acro&s;s the no&s;e, and over both cheeks; his hair was quite white as well as his beard. His garment was made of flax, with a wrought border, under which was a kind of petticoat, made of a cloth called Aooree Waow; his ears were decorated with teeth and pieces of green &s;tone. His voice was &s;oft and low, and he appeared, upon the whole, to be a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank. The&s;e Indians retired greatly &s;atisfied with the pre&s;ents they had received; and the Endeavour, after parting from them, &s;teered coa&s;twi&s;e, till the 9th in the morning, which being a clear day, it was ea&s;ily determined that Eahienomauwe was certainly an i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 14th of February about &s;ixty Indi|ans, in four double canoes, came within a &s;tone's ca&s;t of the &s;hip, which they beheld with &s;urpri&s;e. Tupia endeavoured to per&s;uade them
<PB N="380" REF="400">
to approach nearer, which they refu&s;ed, and made towards the &s;hore, but did not reach it till after it was dark. From the behavi|our of the&s;e people, the place from whence they came was called the <HI>I&s;land of Lookers-on.</HI> On the 17th of this month they &s;aw an i&s;land, five leagues from the coa&s;t of Tovy Poenammoo, which was called after the name of Mr. Banks. This i&s;land appeared to be inhabited, as they &s;aw a few Indians on it, and in one place be|held the &s;moke of a fire. As no farther &s;igns of land appeared to the &s;outhward, they &s;teer|ed to the we&s;t on Sunday the 18th, and made various way till the 23d, when it fell calm. Mr. Banks took this opportunity to go a &s;hooting in his boat; when he &s;hot &s;ome Port Egmont hens, like tho&s;e found on the i&s;land of Faro, and were the fir&s;t they had &s;een on this coa&s;t. On Sunday the 25th they &s;aw a point of land, in 45 deg. 35 min. &s;outh latitude, which Cap|tain Cook named CAPE SAUNDERS, in honour of the Admiral of that name. They kept at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the &s;hore, which is inter|&s;per&s;ed with hills that are green, and abound in trees; but they did not &s;ee a &s;ingle inhabitant. They had various winds and &s;eas till the 4th of March, when they &s;aw &s;everal whales and &s;eals.&mdash;On the 9th they &s;aw a ledge of rocks, and &s;oon afterwards another ledge, three leagues from the &s;hore, which they pa&s;&s;ed to the north during the night, and di&s;covered the others un|der
<PB N="381" REF="401">
their bow at day-break. Thus they had a narrow e&s;cape from de&s;truction; and the&s;e ledges of rocks were denominated the TRAPS, from their being adapted to entrap the unwary. The &s;outhermo&s;t point of this land they called SOUTH CAPE, and indeed it proved to be the &s;outhern extremity of the whole country.</P>
<P>In the morning they &s;ailed northward, and, on the day following, di&s;covered a barren rock, about a mile in circumference, very high, and five leagues from the main land. This was called SOLANDER'S ISLAND. On the 13th they di&s;covered a bay, which contains &s;everal i&s;lands, behind which, if there be depth of water, there mu&s;t be &s;helter from all winds. Captain Cook called this DUSKY-BAY, and it is remark|able for having five high, peaked rocks, lying off it, which look like the thumb and four fin|gers of a man's hand; whence it was denomi|nated POINT FIVE FINGERS. Three leagues to the &s;outh of Du&s;ky Bay lies the we&s;termo&s;t point of land on the whole coa&s;t, which was therefore called WEST-CAPE.</P>
<P>On the 14th they pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall narrow opening in the land, where there appeared to be a good harbour, formed by an i&s;land. On the land behind it were mountains covered with &s;now. On the 16th they pa&s;&s;ed a point, con|&s;i&s;ting of high red cliffs, which received the name of CASCADE POINT, from a ca&s;cade of water which fell down it in &s;everal &s;mall &s;treams.
<PB N="382" REF="402">
On the 18th in the morning they ob&s;erved the vallies as well as the mountains covered with &s;now, which they thought had fallen in the night, when they had rain at &s;ea. On the 23d they gave the name of <HI>Rock's Point</HI> to a head of land, off which lay &s;ome rocks above the water.</P>
<P>They had now almo&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the whole of the north we&s;t coa&s;t of Tovy Poenammoo; the face of the country afforded nothing worth notice, but a ridge of rocks of a &s;tupendous height, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which Dr. Hawke&s;worth de&s;cribes as totally barren and naked, except where they are covered with &s;now, which is to be &s;een in large patches in many parts of them, and has probably lain there ever &s;ince the creation of the world; a pro&s;pect more rude, craggy, and de&s;olate than this country affords from the &s;ea, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be conceived; for as far inland as the eye can reach, nothing ap|pears but the &s;ummits of rocks, which &s;tand &s;o near together, that, in&s;tead of vallies, there is only fi&s;&s;ures between them."</Q></P>
<P>By the 27th they had &s;ailed round the whole country, and determined to depart from the coa&s;t, as &s;oon as they had taken in a &s;tock of water. For this purpo&s;e the Captain went a&s;hore in the long-boat, and found an excellent watering-place, and a proper birth for the &s;hip; which being moored, they began filling their
<PB N="383" REF="403">
ca&s;ks; while the carpenter and his crew were employed in cutting wood. On the 30th the Captain, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, went in the pinnace to examine the bay, and the land on its borders, on which the two la&s;t mentioned gentlemen found &s;everal plants, of a &s;pecies they had not &s;een before. They &s;aw no inhabitants; but found &s;everal Indian huts, which appeared to have been long de&s;erted. When they returned on board in the evening, the &s;hip was ready to &s;ail, all the wood and water being on board. A council of the officers was now held, as to the pa&s;&s;age they &s;hould take to England; when it was re&s;olved to return by the Ea&s;t Indies, and with that view to &s;teer for the ea&s;t coa&s;t of New Holland, and then follow the direction of that coa&s;t to the northward.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution being taken, they &s;ailed at day-break, on Saturday March 31, 1770, and taking their departure from an ea&s;tern point, which they had &s;een on the 23d, they called it CAPE FAREWELL. The bay from which they &s;ailed was named ADMIRALTY BAY, and the two Capes thereof CAPE STEPHENS, and CAPE JACKSON, the names of the then Secretaries to the Board of Admiralty. Between the i&s;land and Cape Farewell is a bay, which they called BLIND BAY, and which Captain Cook &s;uppo&s;es, to be the &s;ame that is di&s;tingui&s;hed in Ta&s;man's Voyage, by the name of Murderers Bay.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="404">We &s;hall now proceed to give &s;uch an ac|count of the country and its inhabitants, as could be acquired during the circumnavigation of the coa&s;t. Abel Jan&s;en Ta&s;man, a Dutch|man, was the fir&s;t European that made a di&s;co|very of NEW ZEALAND, to which he gave the name of STAATEN LAND, that is, the land of the States General. Ta&s;man never went on &s;hore, as the Indians attacked him &s;oon after he came to an anchor, in the bay to which he gave the name of Murderers Bay. From the time of Ta&s;man's di&s;covery, which was in Decem|ber 1642, till the pre&s;ent voyage, the whole country, except that part which Ta&s;man &s;aw, remained totally unknown, and has been &s;up|po&s;ed to be part of a &s;outhern continent; but it now proves to be two large i&s;lands, &s;eparated by a &s;treight, of the breadth of about twelve miles.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the&s;e i&s;lands is between 34 and 48 degrees of &s;outh latitude, and 181 and 194 degrees of we&s;t longitude. The na|tives call the northern i&s;land Eaheinomauwe, and the &s;outhermo&s;t Tovy Paenammoo.</P>
<P>Eaheinomauwe, though hilly, and in &s;ome places mountainous, is well &s;tored with wood, and there is a rivulet in every valley. The &s;oil of the vallies is light, but is &s;o fertile, as to be well adapted for the plentiful production of all &s;orts of the fruits, plants, and corn of Eu|rope; the inhabitants of which, if a &s;etttle|ment
<PB N="385" REF="405">
&s;hould be effected, might &s;upply them|&s;elves with the nece&s;&s;aries and even luxuries of life, without any extraordinary exertion of their indu&s;try. The &s;ummer is more equally warm, though not hotter than in England; and it is imagined, from the vegetables that were found, that the winter is not &s;o &s;evere.</P>
<P>Dogs and rats are the only quadrupedes that were &s;een, and of the latter only a very few. The inhabitants breed the dogs for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of eating them. There are &s;eals and whales on the coa&s;t; and they once &s;aw a &s;ea|lion. The birds are hawks, owls, quails; and there are &s;ong-birds, who&s;e note is wonderfully melodious. There are ducks and &s;hags of &s;e|veral &s;orts, not unlike tho&s;e of Europe; and the gannet, which is exactly the &s;ame. The &s;ea coa&s;t is vi&s;ited by albatro&s;&s;es, &s;heerwaters, pintados and penguins, de&s;criptions of which have been given in other voyages. The in&s;ects are fle&s;h flies, beetles, butterflies, &s;and-flies and mu&s;quitos.</P>
<P>Tovy Poenammoo appears to be a barren country, is very mountainous, and almo&s;t de&s;|titute of inhabitants.</P>
<P>The &s;ea which wa&s;hes the&s;e i&s;lands abounds with fi&s;h, which are equally delicate and whole|&s;ome food. They &s;eldom came to anchor but they catched enough, with hook and line only, to &s;upply the whole &s;hip's crew: and, when they fi&s;hed with nets, every me&s;s in the &s;hip,
<PB N="386" REF="406">
except tho&s;e who were too indolent, &s;alted as much as &s;upplied them when at &s;ea for &s;everal weeks after. The fi&s;h was not le&s;s various in kind than plentiful in quantity: there were ma|ny &s;orts they had never before &s;een; but the &s;ailors readily gave names to all of them. They had &s;everal &s;orts of mackrel, one of which was the &s;ame as we eat in England. The&s;e fi&s;h were catched by the natives in immen&s;e quantities, and &s;old to the crew on the mo&s;t moderate terms: but the riche&s;t dainty the&s;e &s;eas afforded was the &s;ea cray-fi&s;h, which differ from tho&s;e &s;een in England, by having more prickles on the back, and being red when fir&s;t catched. The&s;e they purcha&s;ed of the natives on the north coa&s;t, who dive for them, and find where they lie with their feet. They had &s;everal kinds of &s;kate, and a kind of dog fi&s;h, of a more delicate fla|vour, though otherwi&s;e &s;imilar to the &s;kate eat|en in London. Eels, congers, clams, oy&s;ters, cockles, and flat fi&s;h, re&s;embling both &s;oles and flounders, were likewi&s;e found in great plenty on this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This country abounds with fore&s;ts, filled with very large, &s;trait, and clean timber. There is one tree about the &s;ize of an oak, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;carlet flower, that appeared to be compo&s;ed of &s;everal fibres; and another which grows in &s;wampy ground, very &s;trait and tall, bearing &s;mall bunches of berries, and a leaf re&s;embling that of the yew tree. About
<PB N="387" REF="407">
four hundred &s;pecies of plants were found, all of which are unknown in England, except garden night-&s;hade, &s;ow-thi&s;tle, two or three kinds of fern, and one or two &s;orts of gra&s;s. They found wild celery, and a kind of cro&s;&s;es, in great a|bundance, on the &s;ea &s;hore; and of eatable plants rai&s;ed by cultivation, only coccos, yams, and &s;weet potatoes. There are plantations of many acres of the&s;e yams and potatoes. The inhabitants likewi&s;e cultivate the gourd; and the Chine&s;e paper mulberry-tree is to be found, but in no abundance. There is only one &s;hrub or tree in this country which produces fruit, and that is a kind of berry almo&s;t ta&s;tele&s;s: but they have a plant which an&s;wers all the u&s;es of hemp and flax. There are two kinds of this plant, the leaves of one of which are yellow, and the other a deep red, and both of them re|&s;emble the leaves of flags. Of the&s;e leaves they make lines and cordage, and much &s;tronger than any thing of the kind in Europe. The&s;e leaves they likewi&s;e &s;plit into breadths, and ty|ing the &s;lips together, form their fi&s;hing-nets. Their common apparel, by a &s;imple proce&s;s, is made from the leaves, and their finer, by an|other preparation, is made from the fibres. This plant is found both on high and low ground, in dry mould, and in deep bogs; but as it grows large&s;t in the latter, that &s;eems to be its proper &s;oil.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="408">Our adventurers were of opinion, that no part of this country is peopled but the &s;ea coa&s;t; &s;o that the number of inhabitants is greatly di&s;|proportioned to the extent of country; and the &s;ettling a colony there, is recommended as an object worthy the notice of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The men of this country are as large as the large&s;t Europeans. Their complexion is brown, but little more &s;o than that of a Spaniard. They are full of fle&s;h, but not lazy and luxuri|ous; and are &s;tout and well &s;haped The wo|men po&s;&s;e&s;s not that delicacy which di&s;tingui&s;hes the European ladies; but their voice is &s;ingu|larly &s;oft, which, as the dre&s;s of both &s;exes is &s;imilar, chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the men. The men are active in a high degree; their hair is black, and their teeth are white and even. The features of both &s;exes are regular; they en|joy perfect health, and live to a very advanced age. They are of the gentle&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, and treat each other with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s: but they are perpetually at war, every little di&s;trict being at enmity with all the re&s;t. This is owing, mo&s;t probably, to the want of food in &s;ufficient quantities, at certain times. They have nei|ther black cattle, &s;heep, hogs, nor goats; &s;o that their chief food being fi&s;h, and that not at all times to be obtained, they are in danger of dying through hunger. They have a few, and but a very few dogs; and when no fi&s;h is to be got, they have only vegetables, &s;uch as yams
<PB N="389" REF="409">
and potatoes, to feed on; and if, by any acci|dent, the&s;e fail them, their &s;ituation mu&s;t be deplorable. This will account for their &s;hock|ing cu&s;tom of eating the bodies which are &s;lain in battle; for he who fights through mere hun|ger, will not &s;cruple to eat the adver&s;ary he has killed.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this cu&s;tom re&s;pecting their enemies, the circum&s;tances and temper of the&s;e people are in favour of tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ettle among them as a colony. They are in need of protection; and their di&s;po&s;itions are &s;o &s;weet, that it would be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to attach them by kindne&s;s. Civilization would be a ble&s;&s;ing to people, whom nature has barely furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of New Zealand are as mo|de&s;t and re&s;erved in their behaviour and con|ver&s;ation as the mo&s;t polite nations of Europe. The women, indeed, were not dead to the &s;ofter impre&s;&s;ions; but their mode of con&s;ent was, in their idea, as harmle&s;s as the con&s;ent to marriage with us, and equally binding for the &s;tipulated time. If any of the Engli&s;h addre&s;&s;ed one of their women, he was inform|ed, that the con&s;ent of her friends mu&s;t be ob|tained, which u&s;ually followed, on his making a pre&s;ent. This done, he was obliged to treat his temporary wife at lea&s;t as delicately as we do in England. A gentleman who &s;ailed in the Endeavour having addre&s;&s;ed a family of &s;ome
<PB N="390" REF="410">
rank, received an an&s;wer, of which the follow|ing is an exact tran&s;lation.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Any of the&s;e young ladies will think them&s;elves honoured by your addre&s;&s;es, but you mu&s;t fir&s;t make me a &s;uitable pre&s;ent, and you mu&s;t then come and &s;leep with us on &s;hore, for day|light mu&s;t by no means be a witne&s;s of what pa&s;&s;es between you."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Indians anoint their hair with oil, melted from the fat of fi&s;h or birds. The poorer people u&s;e that which is rancid, &s;o that they &s;mell very di&s;agreeable; but tho&s;e of &s;u|perior rank make u&s;e of that which is fre&s;h. They wear combs, both of bone and wood, which is con&s;idered as an ornament when &s;tuck upright in the hair. The men tie their hair in a bunch on the crown of the head, and adorn it with the feathers of birds, which they likewi&s;e &s;ometimes place on each &s;ide of the temples. They commonly wear &s;hort beards. The hair of the women &s;ometimes flows over the &s;houl|ders, and &s;ometimes is cut &s;hort. Both &s;exes, but the men more than the women, mark their bodies with black &s;tains, called Amoco. In general the women &s;tain only the lips; but &s;ometimes mark other parts with black patches: the men, on the contrary, put on additional marks from year to year, &s;o that tho&s;e who are very ancient are almo&s;t covered. Exclu&s;ive of the amoco, they mark them&s;elves with furrows. The&s;e furrows make a hideous appearance, the
<PB N="391" REF="411">
edges being indented, and the whole quite black. The ornaments of the face are drawn in the &s;piral form, with equal elegance and correct|ne&s;s, both cheeks being marked exactly alike; while the paintings on their bodies re&s;emble fillagree work, and the foliage in old cha&s;ed or|naments: but no two faces or bodies are paint|ed exactly after the &s;ame model. The people of New Zealand frequently left the breech free from the&s;e marks; which the inhabitants of Otaheite adorned beyond any other. The&s;e In|dians likewi&s;e paint their bodies, by rubbing them with red oker, either dry, or mixed with oil.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s is formed of the leaves of the flag &s;plit into &s;lips, which are interwoven, and made into a kind of matting, the ends, which are &s;even or eight inches in length, hanging out on the upper &s;ide. One piece of this matting being tied over the &s;houlders, reaches to the knees: the other piece being wrapped round the wai&s;t, falls almo&s;t to the ground. The&s;e two pieces are fa&s;tened to a &s;tring, which, by means of a bodkin of bone, is pa&s;&s;ed through, and tacks them together. The men wear the lower garment only at particular times.</P>
<P>They have two kinds of cloth be&s;ides the coar&s;e matting or &s;hag abovementioned; one of which is as coar&s;e, but beyond all proportion &s;tronger than Engli&s;h canva&s;s; the other, which is formed of the fibres of a plant, drawn into
<PB N="392" REF="412">
threads which cro&s;s and bind each other, re|&s;embles the matting on which we place our di&s;hes at table. They make borders of different colours to both the&s;e &s;orts of cloth, re&s;embling girls &s;amplars, and fini&s;hed with great neatne&s;s and elegance. What they con&s;ider as the mo&s;t ornamental part of their dre&s;s is the fur of dogs, which they cut into &s;tripes, and &s;ew on different parts of their apparel. As dogs are not plenty, they di&s;po&s;e the&s;e &s;tripes with great oeconomy. They have a few dre&s;&s;es, ornamented with fea|thers; and one man was &s;een covered wholly with tho&s;e of the red parrot.</P>
<P>The women never tie their hair on the top of their head, nor adorn it with feathers; and are le&s;s anxious about dre&s;s than the men. Their lower garment is bound tight round them, ex|cept when they go a fi&s;hing, and then they are careful that the men &s;hall not &s;ee them. It once happened that &s;ome of the &s;hip's crew &s;ur|prized them in this &s;ituation, when &s;ome of them hid them&s;elves among the rocks, and the re&s;t kept their bodies under water till they had form|ed a girdle and apron of weeds; in a word, their whole behaviour manife&s;ted the mo&s;t re|fined ideas of female mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>The ears of both &s;exes are bored, and the holes &s;tretched &s;o as to admit a man's finger. The ornaments of their ears are feathers, cloth, bones, and &s;ometimes bits of wood; a great many of them made u&s;e of the nails which
<PB N="393" REF="413">
were given them by the Engli&s;h, for this purpo&s;e, and the women &s;ometimes adorned their ears with the white down of the albatro&s;s, which they &s;pread before and behind the hole, in a large bunch. They likewi&s;e hung to their ears by &s;trings, chi&s;&s;els, bodkins, the teeth of dogs, and the teeth and nails of their decea&s;ed friends. The arms and ancles of the women are adorned with &s;hells and bones, or any thing el&s;e through which they can pa&s;s a &s;tring. The men wear a piece of green talc, or whalebone, with the re&s;emblance of a man carved on it, hanging to a &s;tring round the neck. They &s;aw one man who had the gri&s;tle of his no&s;e perforated, and a feather being pa&s;&s;ed through it, projected over each cheek.</P>
<P>The&s;e people &s;hew le&s;s ingenuity in the &s;truc|ture of their hou&s;es, than in any thing el&s;e be|longing to them; they are from &s;ixteen to twen|ty-four feet long, ten or twelve wide, and &s;ix or eight in height. The frame is of &s;light &s;ticks of wood, and the walls and roof are made of dry gra&s;s pretty firmly compacted. Some of them are lined with the bark of trees, and the ridge of the hou&s;e is formed by a pole, which runs from one end to the other. The door is only high enough to admit a per&s;on crawling on hands and knees; and the roof is &s;toping. There is a &s;quare hole near the door, &s;erving both for window and chimney, near which is the fire-place. A plank is placed near
<PB N="394" REF="414">
the door, adorned with a &s;ort of carving, and this they con&s;ider as an ornamental piece of fur|niture. The &s;ide walls and roof projecting two or three feet beyond the walls at each end, form a &s;ort of portico, where benches are placed to &s;it on. The fire is made in the mid|dle of a hollow &s;quare in the floor, which is en|clo&s;ed with wood or &s;tone. They &s;leep near the walls, where the ground is covered with &s;traw for their beds.</P>
<P>Some who can afford it, and who&s;e families are large, have three or four hou&s;es, enclo&s;ed within a court yard. Their cloaths, arms, feathers, &s;ome ill-made tools, and a che&s;t, in which all the&s;e are depo&s;ited, form all the fur|niture of the in&s;ide of the hou&s;e. Their ham|mers to beat fern-root, gourds to hold water, and ba&s;kets to contain provi&s;ions, are placed without the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>One hou&s;e was found near forty feet long, twenty wide, and fourteen high. Its &s;ides were adorned with carved planks of workman&s;hip &s;uperior to the re&s;t; but the building appeared to have been left unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Though the people &s;leep warm enough at home, they &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e the inclemency of the weather, when they go in &s;earch of fi&s;h or fern-roots. Sometimes, indeed, they place a &s;mall defence to windward; but frequently &s;leep under bu&s;hes, with their arms placed round them, without the lea&s;t &s;helter whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="415">Be&s;ides the fern-root, which &s;erves them for bread, they feed on albatro&s;&s;es, penguins, and &s;ome other birds. Whatever they eat is either roa&s;ted or baked, as they have no ve&s;&s;el in which water can be boiled.</P>
<P>They &s;aw no plantations of coccos, potatoes and yams, to the &s;outhward, though there were many in the northern parts.&mdash;The natives drink no other liquor than water, and enjoy perfect and uninterrupted health.&mdash;When wounded in battle, the wound heals in a very &s;hort time without the application of medicine; and the very old people carry no other marks of decay about them than the lo&s;s of their hair and teeth, and a failure of their mu&s;cular &s;trength:&mdash;but enjoy an equal &s;hare of health and chearful|ne&s;s with the younge&s;t.&mdash;Such are the happy effects of exerci&s;e and temperance!</P>
<P>The canoes of this country are not unlike the whale-boats of New England, being long and narrow. The larger &s;ort &s;eem to be built for war, and will hold from thirty to one hun|dred men. One of the&s;e at Tolaga mea&s;ured near &s;eventy feet in length, &s;ix in width, and four in depth. It was &s;harp at the bottom, and con&s;i&s;ted of three lengths, about two or three inches thick, and tied firmly together with &s;trong plaiting: each &s;ide was formed of one entire plank, about twelve inches broad, and about an inch and a half thick, which were fitted to the bottom part with equal &s;trength and inge|nuity.
<PB N="396" REF="416">
Several thwarts were laid from one &s;ide to the other, to which they were &s;ecurely fa&s;ten|ed, in order to &s;trengthen the canoes.</P>
<P>Some few of their canoes, at Mercury Bay and Opoorage, are all made entirely of one trunk of wood, which is made hollow by fire: but by far the greater part are built after the plan above de&s;cribed. The &s;maller boats, which are u&s;ed chiefly in fi&s;hing, are adorned at head and &s;tern with the figure of a man, the eyes of which are compo&s;ed of the white &s;hells of &s;ea-ears, a tongue of enormous &s;ize is thru&s;t out of the mouth, and the whole face is a picture of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute deformity. The grander canoes, which are intended for war, are ornamented with open work, and covered with fringes of black feathers, which gives the whole an air of perfect elegance: the &s;ide boards, which are carved in a rude man|ner, are embelli&s;hed with tufts of white fea|thers.</P>
<P>The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are rowed with a kind of pad|dles, between five and &s;ix feet in length, the blade of which is a long oval, gradually de|crea&s;ing till it reaches the handle; and the ve|locity with which they row with the&s;e paddles is really &s;urpri&s;ing. Their &s;ails are compo&s;ed of a kind of mat or netting, which is extended between two upright poles, one of which is fixed on each &s;ide. Two ropes, fa&s;tened to the top of each pole, &s;erve in&s;tead of &s;heets.

The ve&s;&s;els are &s;teered by two men, having each a paddle, and &s;itting in the &s;tern; but they can only &s;ail before the wind, in which di|rection they move with con&s;iderable &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e Indians u&s;e axes, adzes and chi&s;&s;els, with which la&s;t they likewi&s;e bore holes.

<P>Their tillage of the ground is excellent, ow|ing to the nece&s;&s;ity they are under of cultivat|ing or running the ri&s;k of &s;tarving.

A long narrow &s;take, &s;harpened to an edge at bot|tom, with a piece fixed acro&s;s a little above it, for the convenience of driving it into the ground with the foot, &s;upplies the place both of plough and &s;pade. The &s;oil being light, their work is not very laborious, and with this in&s;trument alone they will turn up ground of &s;ix or &s;even acres in extent.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="419">The &s;eine, the large net which has been al|ready noticed, is produced by the united la|bour, and is probably the joint property of a whole town. Their fi&s;h-hooks are of &s;hell or bone; and they have ba&s;kets of wicker-work to hold the fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Their warlike weapons are &s;pears, darts, bat|tle-axes, and the patoo-patoo. The &s;pear, which is pointed at each end, is about &s;ixteen feet in length, and they hold it in the middle, &s;o that it is difficult to parry a pu&s;h from it. Whether they fight in boats or on &s;hore, the battle is hand to hand, &s;o that they mu&s;t make bloody work of it. They tru&s;t chiefly in the patoo patoo, which is fa&s;tened to their wri&s;ts by means of a &s;trong &s;trap, that it may not be wrenched out of their hand. The&s;e are worn in the girdles of people of a &s;uperior rank, as a military ornament. They have a kind of &s;taff of di&s;tinction, which is carried by the prin|cipal warriors. It is formed of a whale's rib, is quite white, and adorned with carvings, fea|thers, and the hair of their dogs; and they &s;ometimes carried a &s;tick &s;ix feet long, inlaid with &s;hells, and otherwi&s;e adorned like the mi|litary &s;taff. This honourable mark of di&s;tinc|tion was commonly borne by the old men.</P>
<P>When they came to attack the Engli&s;h, there was u&s;ually one or more thus di&s;tingui&s;hed in each canoe. It was their cu&s;tom to &s;top at a|bout fifty or &s;ixty yards di&s;tance from the &s;hip,

when the commanding officer, ari&s;ing from his &s;eat, and putting on a garment of dog's &s;kin, u&s;ed to direct them how to proceed. When they were too far from the &s;hip to reach it either with &s;tone or lance, they cried out, <HI>Haromai, haromai, harre uta a patoo-patoo oge.</HI>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come to us, come on &s;hore, and we will kill you all with our patoo-patoos."</Q> During the&s;e menaces they approached the &s;hip, till they came along-&s;ide, talking peaceably at intervals, and an&s;wering whatever que&s;tions they were a&s;k|ed. Then again their threats were renewed, till, imagining the &s;ailors were afraid of them, they began the war-&s;ong and dance&mdash;an engagement always followed, and &s;ometimes continued till the firing of &s;mall &s;hot repul&s;ed them; at others, only till they had &s;atiated their vengeance by throwing a few &s;tones on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>In the war-dance, their motions are nume|rous, their limbs are di&s;torted, and their faces are agitated. Their tongue hangs out of their mouths to a va&s;t length, and their eye-lids are drawn &s;o as to form a circle round the eye; they &s;hake their darts, brandi&s;h their &s;pears, and wave their patoo-patoos to and fro in the air. They accompany this dance with a &s;ong, which is &s;ung in concert; every &s;train ending with a loud and deep &s;igh. There is an activity and vigour in their dancing, which is truly admi|rable; and their idea of keeping time in mu&s;ic is &s;uch, that &s;ixty or eighty paddles will &s;trike
<PB N="400" REF="423">
at once again&s;t the &s;ides of their boats, and make only one report.</P>
<P>They &s;ometimes &s;ing, in times of peace, in a manner re&s;embling the war-&s;ong; but then they do not dance with it. The women, who&s;e voices are exceeding &s;oft and harmonious, like|wi&s;e &s;ing in a melodious, but mournful manner; and their &s;ongs appear as if &s;ung in parts. Their in&s;truments of mu&s;ick are, a &s;hell, from which they produce a &s;ound, re&s;embling that made by a common horn; and a wooden pipe, not &s;uperior in mu&s;ical &s;ound to a child's whi&s;tle.</P>
<P>The&s;e people fortify all their hippahs, or towns, of which there are &s;everal between the bay of Plenty and queen Charlotte's &s;ound. In the&s;e the inhabitants of tho&s;e parts con|&s;tantly re&s;ide; but near Tolaga, Tegadoo, Hawk's bay, and Poverty bay, there are no towns, only &s;ingle hou&s;es at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance apart. On the &s;ides of the hills were erected long &s;tages, &s;upplied with darts and &s;tones, which were thought to be retreats in time of battle, and on which, from their ele|vated &s;ituation, they can combat the enemy with the&s;e weapons to great advantage. In the&s;e repo&s;itories they &s;tore their dried fi&s;h and fern-roots. The inhabitants of this part of the country were all &s;ubject to Teratu, who re&s;ided near the bay of Plenty; and to their being thus united under one Chief, they owed a &s;ecurity unknown to the inhabitants of the other parts
<PB N="401" REF="424">
of the country. There were &s;everal inferior governors in Teratus's dominions, to whom the mo&s;t implicit obedience was paid. One of the inhabitants having robbed the Engli&s;h, complaint was made to a Chief, who cha&s;ti&s;ed him by kicking and &s;triking him; while the thief bore his puni&s;hment with unre&s;i&s;ting hu|mility.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the &s;outhern parts ap|peared to be co-partners in their fi&s;hing-nets and fine apparel. The latter, which probably were obtained in war, were kept in a little hut, de&s;tined for that u&s;e, in the centre of the town, and the &s;everal parts of the nets, being made by different families, were afterwards joined together for the common u&s;e. The gentlemen imagined, that the employment of the men con|&s;i&s;ted in cultivating the ground, making nets, catching birds, and fi&s;hing; while the women were engaged in weaving cloth, procuring fern-roots, and &s;hell fi&s;h, and dre&s;&s;ing food.</P>
<P>With regard to religion, they acknowledge one &s;uperior being, and &s;everal &s;ubordinate. Their mode of wor&s;hip could not be learned, nor was any place proper for that purpo&s;e &s;een. There was indeed a &s;mall &s;quare area, encom|pa&s;&s;ed with &s;tones, in the middle of which hung a ba&s;ket of fern-roots on one of their &s;pades. This they &s;aid was offered to the gods, in the hope of a plentiful crop of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="425">The inhabitants of the &s;outhern di&s;trict &s;aid, they di&s;po&s;ed of their dead by throwing them into the &s;ea; but tho&s;e of the north &s;aid, they buried them in the ground: our adventurers, however, &s;aw not the lea&s;t &s;ign of any grave or monument; but the body of almo&s;t every in|habitant bore the marks of wounds which they had given them&s;elves, in token of grief for the lo&s;s of their friends and relations. Some of the&s;e &s;cars were newly made, which is a proof that their friends had died while the &s;hip's crew were there; yet no one &s;aw any thing like a fu|neral, as the&s;e i&s;landers conceal every thing re&s;|pecting the dead, with the utmo&s;t caution.</P>
<P>A great &s;imilitude was ob&s;erved between the dre&s;s, furniture, boats and nets of the New Zealanders, and tho&s;e of the inhabitants of the South-&s;ea i&s;lands, which furni&s;hed a &s;trong proof, that the common ance&s;tors of both were na|tives of the &s;ame country. Indeed the inha|bitants of the&s;e different places have a tradition, that their ance&s;tors migrated from another country many ages &s;ince; and they both agree, that this country was called HEAWIGE. But perhaps a yet &s;tronger proof that their origin was the &s;ame, will ari&s;e from the &s;imilitude of their language, of which the following is a &s;pecimen.</P>

<P>They &s;ailed from Cape Farewell on the 31&s;t of March 1770, and had fine weather and a fair wind till the 9th of April, when they &s;aw a tro|pic bird, in the latitude of 38 degrees 29 mi|nutes &s;outh, a &s;ight very unu&s;ual in &s;o high a la|titude. On the 15th they &s;aw an egg-bird and a gannet; and on the day following a &s;mall land-bird perched on the rigging, from which they concluded they were near land; but they found no ground with 120 fathom. On the 18th, in the morning, they &s;aw a pintado-bird, and &s;ome
<PB N="404" REF="427">
Port Egmont hens, an infallible &s;ign that land was not very di&s;tant At &s;ix o'clock in the morning of the 19th they di&s;covered land four or five leagues di&s;tant; the &s;outhermo&s;t part of which was called POINT HICKS, in compliment to Mr. Hicks, the fir&s;t Lieutenant, who made the di&s;covery of it. At noon they di&s;covered another point of the &s;ame land, ri&s;ing in a round hillock, extremely like the Ram-Head at the entrance of Plymouth Sound, for which rea&s;on Captain Cook gave it the &s;ame name. What they had yet &s;een of the land was low and even, and the inland parts were green, and covered with wood. They now &s;aw three water|&s;pouts at the &s;ame time, one of which continued a quarter of an hour. At &s;ix in the evening the northermo&s;t point on the main land, which was di&s;tant about two leagues, was named CAPE HOWE. On the following day they had a di&s;|tant view of the country, which was in general covered with wood, and inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;eve|ral &s;mall lawns. It appeared to be inhabited, as &s;moke was &s;een in &s;everal places. At four o'clock the next morning they &s;aw a high moun|tain, which, from its &s;hape, they called MOUNT DROMEDARY, under which there is a point, which received the name of POINT DROMEDA|RY. In the evening they were oppo&s;ite a point of land which ro&s;e perpendicularly, and was called POINT UPRIGHT. On Sunday the 22d they were &s;o near the &s;hore, as to &s;ee &s;everal of
<PB N="405" REF="428">
the inhabitants on the coa&s;t, who were of a very dark complexion, if not perfect negroes. At noon they &s;aw a remarkably peaked hill, to which the Captain gave the name of the PIGE|ON-HOUSE, from its re&s;emblance to &s;uch a build|ing. The trees on this i&s;land were both tall and large; but they &s;aw no place fit to give &s;helter even to a boat.</P>
<P>The Captain gave the name of CAPE GEORGE to a point of land which he di&s;covered on St. George's day: about two leagues to the north of which the &s;ea formed a bay, which, from its &s;hape, was called LONG NOSE; eight leagues from which lies RED-POINT, &s;o called from the colour of the &s;oil in its neighbourhood. On the 27th they &s;aw &s;everal of the inhabitants walking along the &s;hore, four of them carry|ing a canoe on their &s;houlders: but as they did not attempt coming off to the &s;hip, the Cap|tain took Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander and Tu|pia in the yawl, and employed four men to row them to that part of the &s;hore where the natives appeared; near which four &s;mall canoes laid clo&s;e in land. The Indians &s;at on the rocks till the yawl was within a quarter of a mile of the &s;hore, and then ran away into the woods. The &s;urf beating violently on the beach, prevented the boat from landing; the gentlemen were therefore obliged to make what ob&s;ervations they could at a di&s;tance. The canoes re&s;embled the &s;maller &s;ort of tho&s;e of New Zealand. They
<PB N="406" REF="429">
&s;aw, with longing eyes, a great number of cab|bage-trees on &s;hore: the other trees were of the palm-kind, and there was no underwood among them.</P>
<P>At five in the evening they returned to the &s;hip, and a light breeze &s;pringing up, they &s;ail|ed to the northward, where they di&s;covered &s;e|veral people on &s;hore round a fire, who, on their approach, retired to an eminence; &s;oon after which two canoes arrived on the &s;hore, and four men, who came in them, joined the others. The pinnace having been &s;ent a head to &s;ound, arrived near the &s;pot where the Indians had &s;ta|tioned them&s;elves, on which one of them hid him&s;elf among the rocks near the landing-place, and the others retreated farther up the hill. The pinnace keeping along &s;hore, the Indians walk|ed nearly in a line with her. They were armed with long pikes, and a weapon re&s;embling a cymeter, and, by various &s;igns and words, in|vited the boat's crew to land. Tho&s;e who did not follow the boat, having ob&s;erved the approach of the &s;hip, brandi&s;hed their wea|pons, and threw them&s;elves into threatening attitudes. The bodies, thighs and legs of two of the&s;e, were painted with white &s;treaks, and their faces were almo&s;t covered with a white powder. They talked to each other with great emotion, and each of them held a kind of cy|meter in his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="430">The &s;hip having come to an anchor, they ob&s;erved a few huts, in which were &s;ome of the natives; and &s;aw &s;ome canoes, in each of which was a man bu&s;ily employed in &s;triking fi&s;h with a kind of &s;pear. They had anchored oppo&s;ite a village of about eight hou&s;es, and ob&s;erved an old woman and three children come out of a wood, laden with fuel for a fire: they were met by three &s;maller children, all of whom, as well as the woman, were quite naked. The old woman frequently looked at the &s;hip with the utmo&s;t indifference, and, as &s;oon as &s;he had made a fire, the fi&s;hermen brought their canoes on &s;hore, and they &s;et about dre&s;&s;ing their din|ner with as much compo&s;ure, as if a &s;hip had been no extraordinary &s;ight.</P>
<P>Having formed a de&s;ign of landing, they manned the boats, and took Tupia with them; and they had no &s;ooner come near the &s;hore, than two men advanced, as if to di&s;pute their &s;etting foot on land. They were each of them armed with different weapons. They called out aloud in a har&s;h tone, <HI>warra warra wai,</HI> the meaning of which Tupia did not under&s;tand. The Captain threw them beads, nails and other trifles, which they took up, and &s;eemed to be delighted with. He then made &s;igns that he wanted water, and u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible means to convince them that no injury was intended. They now made &s;igns to the boat's crew to land, on which they put the boat in; but they
<PB N="408" REF="431">
had no &s;ooner done &s;o, than the two Indians came again to oppo&s;e them. A mu&s;quet was now fired between them, on the report of which one of them dropped a bundle of lances, which he in&s;tantly &s;natched up again in great ha&s;te. One of them then threw a &s;tone at the boat, on which the Captain ordered a mu&s;ket loaded with &s;mall &s;hot to be fired, which wounding the elde&s;t of them on the legs, he retired ha&s;tily to one of their hou&s;es, which &s;tood at &s;ome little di&s;tance. The people in the boats now landed, imagining that the wound which this man had received would put an end to the con|te&s;t; in this, however, they were mi&s;taken, for he immediately returned with a kind of &s;hield, of an oval figure, painted white in the middle, with two holes in it to &s;ee through. They now advanced with great intrepidity, and both di&s;charged their lances at the boat's crew, but did not wound any of them. Another mu&s;ket was now fired at them, on which they threw another lance, and then took to their heels. The crew now went up to the huts, in one of which they found the children, who had &s;ecreted them&s;elves behind &s;ome bark. They looked at them, but left them without their knowing they had been &s;een; and having thrown &s;ome pieces of cloth, ribbons, beads, and other things into the hut, they took &s;everal of their lan|ces, and reimbarked in the boat. The canoes on this coa&s;t were about thirteen feet in length,
<PB N="409" REF="432">
each made of the bark of a &s;ingle tree, tied up at the ends, and kept open in the middle by means of &s;ticks placed acro&s;s them; their pad|dles are very &s;mall, and they u&s;e two at a time.</P>
<P>They now &s;ailed to the north point of the bay, where they found a plenty of fre&s;h water. On taking a view of the hut where they had &s;een the children, they had the mortification to find that every Indian was fled, and that they had left all the pre&s;ents behind them. The Captain now went in the pinnace to in&s;pect the bay, and &s;aw &s;everal of the natives, who all fled as he approached them. Some men having been &s;ent to get wood and water, they no &s;ooner, came on board to dinner, than the natives came down to the place, and examined the ca&s;ks with great attention, but did not offer to remove them. When the people were on &s;hore in the afternoon, about twenty of the natives, all armed, advanced within a trifling di&s;tance of them, and then &s;topped, while two of their number approached &s;till nearer. Mr. Hicks, the commanding officer, on &s;hore, went to|wards them, with pre&s;ents in his hands, and endeavoured, by every po&s;&s;ible means, to a&s;&s;ure them of his friendly intentions, but to no pur|po&s;e, for they retired before he came up to them. In the evening Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and So|lander went with the Captain to a cove north of the bay, where they catched between three and four hundred weight of fi&s;h, in four hauls.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="433">On Monday the 30th the natives came down to the huts before it was light, and were re|peatedly heard to &s;hout very loud; and &s;oon af|ter day-break they were &s;een on the beach; but quickly retired about a mile, and kindled &s;e|veral fires in the woods. This day &s;ome of the &s;hip's crew being employed in cutting gra&s;s, at a di&s;tance from the main body of tho&s;e on &s;hore, a party of Indians made towards them; on which the gra&s;s-cutters retreated to the main body, while the natives pur&s;ued them; but &s;topping within fifty or &s;ixty yards of them, they &s;houted &s;everal times, and retired to the woods. In the evening they behaved exactly in the &s;ame manner, when the Captain followed them alone and unarmed for &s;ome time, but they &s;till retired as he approached.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day May the fir&s;t, the &s;outh point of the bay was named SUTHERLAND POINT, one of the &s;eamen, of the name of Sutherland, hav|ing died that day, and been buried on &s;hore. This day Me&s;&s;rs. Banks, Solander, the Captain and a few other gentlemen, went on &s;hore, and left more pre&s;ents in the huts, &s;uch as looking-gla&s;&s;es, combs, &amp;c. but the former ones had not been taken away.&mdash;Making an excur&s;ion about the country, they found it agreeably va|riegated with wood and lawn. The trees being &s;trait and tall, and without underwood, the country might be cultivated without cutting down one of them. The gra&s;s grows in large
<PB N="411" REF="434">
tufts, almo&s;t clo&s;e to each other, and there is a great plenty of it. In this excur&s;ion they met with many places where the inhabitants had &s;lept without &s;helter; but they &s;aw only one man, who ran away the moment he beheld them. They left more pre&s;ents, in their huts, and at their &s;leeping-places, in hopes of producing a friendly intercour&s;e. They &s;aw the dung of an animal which fed on gra&s;s, and traced the foot|&s;teps of another, which had claws like a dog, and was probably about the &s;ize of a wolf: they di&s;covered the track of a &s;mall animal, who&s;e foot was like that of a pole-cat; and &s;aw one animal alive, about the &s;ize of a rabbit. They found &s;ome wood which had been felled, and the bark &s;tripped off by the natives; and &s;aw &s;everal growing trees, in which &s;teps had been cut, for the convenience of a&s;cending them. The trees abounded with a va&s;t variety of beau|tiful birds, among which were cockatoos, par|roquets and loriquets, which flew in large flocks.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Lieutenant, Mr. Gore, having been with a boat to dredge for oy&s;ters, &s;aw &s;ome Indians, who made &s;igns for him to come on &s;hore, which he declined. Having fini&s;hed his bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;ent the boat away, and went by land with a Mid&s;hipman, to join the party that was getting water. In their way they met with more than twenty of the natives, who follow|ed them &s;o clo&s;e, as to come within a few yards
<PB N="412" REF="435">
of them. Mr. Gore &s;topped and faced them; on which the Indians &s;topped al&s;o, and when he proceeded again they followed him; but they did not attack him, though they had each man his lance. The Indians coming in &s;ight of the Waterers, &s;tood &s;till at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile, while Mr. Gore and his com|panion reached their &s;hipmates in &s;afety. Two or three of the Waterers now advanced towards the Indians; but ob&s;erving they did not retire, they very imprudently turned about, and re|treated ha&s;tily; this apparent cowardice in&s;pi|rited the &s;avages, who di&s;charged four lances at the fugitives, which flying beyond them, they e&s;caped unhurt. They now &s;topped to pick up the lances, on which the Indians retired in their turn. At this in&s;tant the Captain came up, with Me&s;&s;rs. Banks, Solander, and Tupia; and advancing, made &s;igns of friend&s;hip; but the poor natives would not wait their coming up to them.</P>
<P>On the following day they again went on &s;hore, where many plants were collected by Dr. Solander and Mr. Banks. They &s;aw &s;everal parties of the Indians, who all ran away on their approach. Tupia having learnt to &s;hoot, frequently &s;trayed alone to &s;hoot parrots; and the Indians con&s;tantly fled from him with as much precipitation as from the Engli&s;h. On the 3d of May, fourteen or fifteen Indians, in the &s;ame number of canoes, were engaged in
<PB N="413" REF="436">
&s;triking fi&s;h within half a mile of the watering-place. At this time a party of the &s;hip's crew were &s;hooting near the fi&s;hermen, one of whom Mr. Banks ob&s;erved to haul up his canoe on the beach, and approach the people who were &s;hoot|ing. He watched their motions, unob&s;erved by them, for more than a quarter of an hour, then put off his boat, and returned to his fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>At this time the Captain, with Dr. Solander and another gentleman, went to the head of the bay to try to form &s;ome connection with the Indians. On their fir&s;t landing they found &s;e|veral Indians on &s;hore, who immediately re|treated to their canoes, and rowed off. They went up the country, where they found the &s;oil to be a deep black mould, which appeared to be calculated for the production of any kind of grain. They &s;aw &s;ome of the fine&s;t meadows that were ever beheld, and met with a few rocky places, the &s;tone of which is &s;andy, and &s;eemed to be admirably adapted for building. In the woods they found a tree bearing cherries, if &s;hape and colour may entitle them to that name, the juice of which was agreeably tart. They now returned to their boat, and &s;eeing a fire at a di&s;tance, rowed towards it, but the In|dians fled on their approach. Near the beach they found &s;even canoes, and as many fires, from whence they judged that each fi&s;herman had dre&s;&s;ed his own dinner. There were oy&s;ters lying on the &s;pot, and &s;ome mu&s;cles roa&s;ting
<PB N="414" REF="437">
on the fire. They ate of the&s;e fi&s;h, and left them &s;ome beads and other trifles in return. They now returned to the &s;hip; and in the even|ing Mr. Banks went out with his gun, and &s;aw a great number of quails, &s;ome of which he &s;hot, and they proved to be the &s;ame kind as tho&s;e of England.</P>
<P>On the following day a Mid&s;hipman having &s;trayed from his companions, came &s;uddenly on an old man and woman, and &s;ome children, who were &s;itting naked under a tree together. They &s;eemed afraid of him, but did not run away. The man wore a long beard, and both him and the woman were grey-headed; but the woman's hair was cut &s;hort. This day, like|wi&s;e, two of another party met with &s;ix Indians on the border of a wood, one of whom calling out very loud, a lance was thrown from the wood, which narrowly mi&s;&s;ed them. The Indians now ran off; and, on looking round, they &s;aw a youth de&s;cend from a tree, who had doubtle&s;s been placed there for the purpo&s;e of throwing the lance at them. This day the Captain went up the country on the north-&s;ide of the bay, which he found to re&s;emble the moory grounds of England; but the land was thinly covered with plants about &s;ixteen inches high The hills ri&s;e gradually behind each o|ther to a great di&s;tance, and between them is mar&s;hy ground. Tho&s;e who had been &s;ent out to fi&s;h this day met with great &s;ucce&s;s; and the
<PB N="415" REF="438">
&s;econd Lieutenant &s;truck a fi&s;h called the &s;ting|ray, which weighed near two hundred and fifty pounds. The next morning a fi&s;h of the &s;ame kind was catched, which weighed three hun|dred and fifty pounds.</P>
<P>The name of BOTANY BAY was given to this place, from the large number of plants collected by Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander. This country produces two kinds of wood which may be deemed timber; one of which is tall and &s;trait, like the pine, and the other is hard, heavy, and dark-coloured, like <HI>lignum vitae:</HI> it yields a red gum, like <HI>&s;anguis draconis,</HI> and bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to an Engli&s;h oak. There are mangroves in abundance, &s;everal kinds of palm, and a few &s;hrubs. Among other kinds of birds, crows were found here, exactly like tho&s;e of England. There is great plenty of water-fowl among the flats of &s;and and mud; one of which is &s;haped like a pelican, is larger than a &s;wan, and has black and white feathers. The&s;e banks of mud abound with cockles, mu&s;cles, oy&s;ters, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, which greatly contribute towards the &s;upport of the natives, who &s;ometimes dre&s;s them on &s;hore, and at other times in their canoes. They likewi&s;e catch many other &s;orts of fi&s;h with hook and line</P>
<P>While captain Cook remained in the harbour, the Engli&s;h colours were di&s;played on &s;hore, daily, and the name of the &s;hip, with the date
<PB N="416" REF="439">
of the year, was carved on a tree near the place where they took in their water.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed from BOTANY BAY on the 6th of May, 1770; at noon were off a harbour which they called PORT JACKSON, and in the evening, near a bay, to which they gave the name of BROKEN BAY. The next day, at noon, the northermo&s;t land in &s;ight projected &s;o as to ju&s;|tify the calling it CAPE THREE POINTS. On Wedne&s;day the 9th, they &s;aw two exceeding beautiful rainbows, the colours of which were &s;trong and lively; and tho&s;e of the inner one &s;o bright, as to reflect its &s;hadow on the water. They made a complete &s;emicircle, and the &s;pace between them was much darker than the re&s;t of the &s;ky. On Thur&s;day they pa&s;&s;ed a low rocky point, which was named POINT STE|PHENS, near which was an inlet, denominated PORT STEPHENS. Next day they &s;aw &s;moke in &s;everal places on the &s;hore; and in the evening di&s;covered three remarkably high hills, near each other, which the Captain named the THREE BROTHERS.</P>
<P>On Sunday the 13th they &s;aw the &s;moke of many fires on a point of land, which was there|fore called SMOKEY CAPE. As they proceeded northward from BOTANY BAY, the land appear|ed high and well covered with wood. On Tue&s;day morning, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their gla&s;&s;es, they di&s;covered about a &s;core of the In|dians, each loaded with a bundle, which they
<PB N="417" REF="440">
imagined to be palm-leaves, to thatch their hou&s;es. They traced them for more than an hour, dur|ing which time they took not the lea&s;t notice of the &s;hip; at length they left the beach, and were lo&s;t behind a hill, which they gained by a gentle a&s;cent.&mdash;At noon the Captain di&s;covered a high point of land, which he called CAPE BYRON. In the evening they di&s;covered break|ers at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hore; &s;o that they were obliged to tack, and get into deeper water; which having done, they lay with the head of the ve&s;&s;el to the land till the next morning, when they were a&s;toni&s;hed to find them&s;elves farther to the &s;outhward than they had been the preceding evening, notwith&s;tand|ing they had a &s;outherly wind all night. In the morning they pa&s;&s;ed the breakers, near a peak|ed mountain, which was named MOUNT WARN|ING; and the point off which they lay was called POINT DANGER. The next day they &s;aw more breakers, near a point which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of POINT LOOK-OUT, to the north of which lies a bay, which Captain Cook call|ed MORETON'S BAY; and the north point of which he named CAPE MORETON. Near this place are three hills, which were called the GLASS HOUSES, from the very &s;trong re&s;em|blance they bore to &s;uch buildings.</P>
<P>On the 18th they de&s;cried a point &s;o une|qual, that it looks like two &s;mall i&s;lands lying under the land; and it was therefore called
<PB N="418" REF="441">
DOUBLE ISLAND POINT. At noon, by the help of gla&s;&s;es, they di&s;covered &s;ome &s;ands, which lay in &s;pots of &s;everal acres, which they ob&s;erv|ed were moveable, and that &s;ome of them had not been long in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as they &s;aw trees half buried, and the tops of others &s;till green; likewi&s;e the naked trunks of &s;ome that had been de&s;troyed by the &s;and. At this time two beautiful water-&s;nakes &s;wam by the &s;hip, which &s;eemed to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from land-&s;nakes, only by their broad and flat tails, which it was thought were u&s;eful to them in &s;wimming. On the 19th they &s;ailed by a point of land, on which a large number of the Indians were a&s;&s;embled, from whence it was called INDIAN HEAD. They &s;oon afterwards &s;aw many more of the natives, and ob&s;erved &s;moke in the day-time, and fires by night. The next day they &s;aw a point, which was named SANDY CAPE, from two large tracts of white &s;and that were on it. They next pa&s;&s;ed a &s;hoal which was called BREAK SEA SPIT, becau&s;e they had now &s;mooth water, after having long encountered a high &s;ea. They had, for &s;ome days pa&s;t, &s;een the &s;ea-birds, called boobies, none of which they had met with before; and which, from half an hour before &s;un-ri&s;ing, to half an hour after, were continually pa&s;&s;ing the &s;hip in large flights: from which it was conjectured, that there was a river or inlet of &s;hallow water to the &s;outhward, where they
<PB N="419" REF="442">
went to feed in the day, returning in the even|ing to &s;ome i&s;lands to the northward. In ho|nour of Captain Hervey, this bay was called HERVEY'S BAY.</P>
<P>On the 22d, by the help of their gla&s;&s;es, they di&s;covered that the land was covered with palm-nut trees, none of which they had &s;een &s;ince they quitted the i&s;lands within the tro|pic. The next morning early the Captain took a party of men, and being attended by Tupia, and the &s;everal gentlemen on board, went on &s;hore to examine the country. They landed a little within the point of a bay, which led into a large lagoon, by the &s;ides of which grows the true mangrove, as it al&s;o does on &s;ome bogs, and &s;wamps of &s;alt-water which they di&s;covered. There were many ne&s;ts of a &s;ingular kind of ant, as green as gra&s;s, in the branches of the&s;e mangroves. When the branches were di&s;turbed they came forth in great num|bers, and bit the di&s;turber mo&s;t &s;everely. The&s;e trees likewi&s;e afforded &s;helter for immen&s;e num|bers of green caterpillars, their bodies were co|vered with hairs, which, on the touch, gave a pain &s;imilar to the &s;ting of a nettle, but much more acute. The&s;e in&s;ects ranged them&s;elves &s;ide by &s;ide on the leaves, thirty or forty toge|ther, in a very regular manner. They &s;aw, a|mong the &s;and banks, many birds larger than &s;wans, which they imagined were pelicans; and they &s;hot a kind of bu&s;tard, which weighed &s;e|venten
<PB N="420" REF="443">
pounds. This bird proved very delicate food, and gave name to the place, which was called BUSTARD-BAY. They likewi&s;e &s;hot a duck of a mo&s;t beautiful plumage, with a white beak They found va&s;t numbers of oy&s;ters of various &s;orts, and, among the re&s;t, &s;ome ham|mer oy&s;ters of a curious kind. While the gen|tlemen were in the woods, &s;everal of the na|tives came down and took a &s;urvey of the &s;hip, and then departed. The gentlemen on &s;hore &s;aw fires in many places, and repairing to one of them, they found about a dozen &s;mall fires burning near each other; but the people were gone, and had left &s;ome &s;hells and bones of fi&s;h they had ju&s;t eaten. They likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;everal pieces of &s;oft bark, about the length and breadth of a man, which they judged had been u&s;ed as beds. This kind of encampment was in a thicket well defended from the wind; and as the place was much trodden, and there was no appearance of a hou&s;e, it was imagined that they &s;pent their nights, as well as days, in the open air: even Tupia &s;hook his head, and ex|claimed, <HI>Taata Enos!</HI> <Q REND="inline">"Poor wretches!"</Q> They &s;ailed the next morning, and on the day follow|ing were a-brea&s;t of a point, which lying imme|diately under the tropic, the Captain called CAPE CAPRICORN, on the we&s;t &s;ide of which they &s;aw an amazing number of large birds re|&s;embling the pelican, &s;ome of which were near five feet high.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="444">On the 26th they &s;tood between a range of almo&s;t barren i&s;lands, and the main land, which is mountainous. They had here very &s;hallow water, and anchored in &s;ixteen feet, which was not two feet more than the &s;hip drew. Mr. Banks tried to fi&s;h from the cabin windows, but the water was too &s;hallow. The ground indeed was covered with crabs, which greedily &s;eized the bait, and held it till they were above wa|ter. The&s;e crabs were of two kinds, one of a very fine blue, with a white belly, and the other marked with blue on the joints, and having three remarkable brown &s;pots on the back. The Captain having &s;ent &s;ome men in a boat a-head to &s;ound, they returned with an account, that there was not water enough for the &s;hip to pa&s;s through, upon which they tacked about and &s;tood back again. In the morning they &s;ailed to the northward, and to the northermo&s;t point of land the Captain gave the name of CAPE MANIFOLD, from the number of high hills appearing above it. Between this cape and the &s;hore is a bay called KEPPEL'S BAY, and &s;ome i&s;lands bearing the name of the &s;ame gen|tleman. On the 28th, being determined to keep the main land clo&s;e aboard, which continued to tend away to the we&s;t, they got among another clu&s;ter of i&s;lands; they were here again greatly alarmed, having on a &s;udden but three fathom water, in a ripling tide; they immediately put the &s;hip about, and hoi&s;ted out the boats in
<PB N="422" REF="445">
&s;earch of deeper water; after which they &s;tood to the we&s;t with an ea&s;y &s;ail, and in the evening, came to the entrance of a bay. On the 29th, in the morning, the ma&s;ter was &s;ent with two boats to &s;ound the bay; and the &s;hip was no &s;ooner under &s;ail, than the boats made the &s;ig|nal, and the &s;hip accordingly came to an an|chor. As they ob&s;erved the tide to flow and ebb con&s;iderably, they imagined this bay to be the entrance of a river which ran up the coun|try: in this place therefore the Captain intend|ed to lay the &s;hip a-&s;hore and clean her bottom; and accordingly landed, in &s;earch of a proper place for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this excur&s;ion Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander attended Captain Cook. They found walking extremely incommodious, the ground being co|vered with gra&s;s, the &s;eeds of which were &s;harp, and bearded, &s;o that they were continually &s;ticking in their cloaths, whence they worked forwards to the fle&s;h, by means of the beard. They were likewi&s;e tormented with the perpe|tual &s;tinging of mu&s;quetos. Several places were found convenient to lay the &s;hip a-&s;hore; but they could meet with no fre&s;h water. In the interior parts of the country they found gum-trees, on the branches of which were white ants ne&s;ts formed of clay, as big as a bu&s;hel. On another tree they found black ants, which formed their lodging in the body of it, after they had eaten away the pith; yet the trees were
<PB N="423" REF="446">
in a flouri&s;hing condition. They found butter|flies in &s;uch incredible numbers, that whatever way they looked, many thou&s;ands were to be &s;een in the air; while every bough and twig was covered with multitudes. They likewi&s;e di&s;covered on dry ground, where it was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been left by the tide, a fi&s;h about the &s;ize of a minnow, having two &s;trong brea&s;t fins, with which it leaped away as nimbly as a frog: it did not appear to be weakened by be|ing out of water, nor even to prefer that ele|ment to the land; for when &s;een in the water it leaped on &s;hore, and pur&s;ued its way. It was likewi&s;e remarked, that where there were &s;mall &s;tones projecting above the water, it cho&s;e ra|ther to leap from one &s;tone to another, than to &s;wim through the water.</P>
<P>On the 30th the Captain went a&s;hore very early, and having gained the &s;ummit of a hill, took a &s;urvey of the coa&s;t, and adjacent i&s;lands; which being done, he accompanied Dr. Solan|der up an inlet, which had been di&s;covered the preceding day; but the weather proving unfa|vourable, they returned early to the &s;hip, hav|ing &s;een only two Indians, who followed the boat a con&s;iderable way along the &s;hore; but the tide running &s;trong, they did not think it prudent to wait for them. This day Mr. Banks went with a party on &s;hore, and having met with a piece of &s;wampy ground, covered with mangroves, they re&s;olved to pa&s;s it, which
<PB N="424" REF="447">
they did, up to the knees in mud, and &s;ome|times crawling on their hands, when they had &s;lipt between the branches of trees, which were interwoven on the &s;urface of the &s;wamp. Hav|ing performed this di&s;agreeable ta&s;k, they ar|rived at a &s;pot where the natives appeared to have &s;lept on the gra&s;s, and where there were the remains of a fi&s;h &s;upper, which had been roa&s;ted by four &s;mall fires. The &s;econd Lieute|nant, at another place, &s;aw the track of a large animal, near a gully of water: he likewi&s;e heard the voices of the Indians, but did not &s;ee any. Two turtles were &s;een at this place, &s;ome water-fowl, and a few &s;mall land-birds.</P>
<P>As no water was to be found, the Captain called the inlet THIRSTY SOUND, which they left on the 31&s;t of May, and having &s;ailed round three &s;mall i&s;lands, anchored in fifteen fathom water. On the 1&s;t of June they got under &s;ail, having a number of i&s;lands in &s;ight, as far as the eye could reach. On the &s;econd at noon they &s;aw a high promontory, which was called CAPE HILLSBOROUGH, and &s;eemed to abound in wood and herbage, di&s;tributed on hills, plains, and in vallies. There are a num|ber of &s;mall i&s;lands in this neighbourhood, on &s;ome of which they &s;aw &s;moke ari&s;ing in dif|ferent places. On Sunday the 3d they di&s;|covered a point, which was named CAPE CON|WAY, and between that and Cape Hills&s;borough a bay, which took the name of REPULSE BAY.
<PB N="425" REF="448">
The land about CAPE CONWAY is diver&s;ified by hills and dales, lawns and woods, and forms a delightfully verdant appearance. By the help of their gla&s;&s;es they di&s;covered three people, on one of the i&s;lands, and a canoe, with an outrigger, like tho&s;e of Otaheite. They this day named the i&s;lands, CUMBERLAND ISLANDS, in honour of the Duke; and a pa&s;&s;age which they di&s;co|vered was called WITSUNDAY'S PASSAGE, from the day on which it was &s;een. At day-break, on Monday, they were a brea&s;t of a point, which took the name of CAPE GLOUCESTER. Names were likewi&s;e this day given to three other places, viz. HOLBORNE ISLE, EDGCUMBE BAY, and CAPE UPSTART, which latter was &s;o called, becau&s;e it ri&s;es abruptly from the low lands that &s;urround it.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, when near the &s;hore, they &s;aw very large columns of &s;moke ri&s;ing from the low-lands. This day they gave name to CLEAVE|LAND BAY, the ea&s;t point of which was called CAPE CLEAVELAND, and the we&s;t MAGNETICAL ISLE, becau&s;e the compa&s;s did not traver&s;e well when they were near it. The points, as well as the main land within them, lay high, and form a barren, rugged and rocky coa&s;t. On the afternoon of Thur&s;day they &s;aw &s;everal large columns of &s;moke, likewi&s;e &s;ome canoes, and &s;everal natives, with &s;ome trees, that they thought were tho&s;e of cocoa-nut; in &s;earch of which fruit Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander went
<PB N="426" REF="449">
a&s;hore with Lieutenant Hicks; but they re|turned in the evening with a few plants, which they had gathered from the cabbage palm, and which had been mi&s;taken for the cocoa-tree. On Friday they gave the name of POINT HIL|LOCK to a point of land; between which and Magnetical I&s;le the &s;hore forms HALIFAX BAY, which affords &s;helter from all winds. At &s;ix this evening they were a-brea&s;t of a point of land, which was named Cape Sandwich, near which lies ROCKINGHAM BAY. Hence they ranged northward along the &s;hore, towards a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, on one of which about forty men, women and children were &s;tanding together, and look|ing at the &s;hip with a curio&s;ity never ob&s;erved among the&s;e people before. The north point of Rockingham bay was called DUNK ISLE, which is &s;carcely to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;hore, it lies &s;o very near it. On Saturday morning they were a-brea&s;t of &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands, which were named FRANKLAND'S ISLES; near which lie two places, which were called CAPE GRAPTON and GREEN ISLAND. Here Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander went a&s;hore with the Cap|tain, who&s;e chief view were to procure water, which not being ea&s;ily to be got, they &s;oon re|turned on board, and the next day arrived near TRINITY BAY, which was &s;o called, becau&s;e it was di&s;covered on Trinity Sunday.</P>
<P>As no accident remarkably unfortunate had befallen our adventurers, during a navigation of
<PB N="427" REF="450">
more than thirteen hundred miles, upon a coa&s;t every where abounding with the mo&s;t dange|rous rocks and &s;hoals; no name expre&s;&s;ive of di&s;tre&s;s had hitherto been given to any cape or point of land which they had &s;een. But they now gave the name of CAPE TRIBULATION to a point which they had ju&s;t di&s;covered, as they here became acquainted with misfortune.</P>
<P>This cape is in &s;ixteen degrees &s;ix minutes &s;outh latitude, and 214 degrees 39 minutes we&s;t longitude.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the evening they &s;hortened &s;ail, to avoid the danger of &s;ome rocks, which were &s;een a head, and to ob&s;erve whether any i&s;lands lay in the offing, as they were now near the latitude of tho&s;e i&s;lands &s;aid to have been di&s;|covered by Quiros. They kept &s;tanding off from &s;ix o'clock till near nine, with a fine breeze and bright moon. They had got from fourteen into twenty-one fathom water; when &s;uddenly they fell into twelve, ten, and eight fathom, in a few minutes. Every man was in|&s;tantly ordered to his &s;tation, and they were on the point of anchoring, when, on a &s;udden, they had again deep water, &s;o that they thought all danger was at an end, concluding they had &s;ailed over the tail of &s;ome &s;hoals which they had &s;een in the evening. They had twenty fathom and upwards before ten o'clock, and this depth continuing &s;ome time, the gentlemen, who had hitherto been upon deck, retired to
<PB N="428" REF="451">
re&s;t; but in le&s;s than an hour the water &s;hallow|ed at once from twenty to &s;eventeen fathom, and, before &s;oundings could be again taken, the &s;hip &s;truck again&s;t a rock, and remained fixed, but from the motion given her by the beating of the &s;urge. Every one was in&s;tantly on deck, with countenances fully expre&s;&s;ive of the agi|tation of their minds. As they knew they were not near the &s;hore, they concluded they had &s;truck again&s;t a rock of coral, the points of which being &s;harp, and the &s;urface &s;o rough, as to grind away whatever is rubbed again&s;t it, tho' with a gentle motion; they had rea&s;on to dread the horror of their &s;ituation!</P>
<P>The &s;ails being taken in, and boats hoi&s;ted out to examine the depth of water, they found that the &s;hip had been carried over a ledge of the rock, and lay in a hollow within it. Finding that the water was deepe&s;t ea&s;tern, they car|ried out the anchor from the &s;tarboard quarter, and applied their whole force to the cap&s;tern, in hopes to get the ve&s;&s;el off, but in vain. She now beat &s;o violently again&s;t the rock, that the crew could &s;carcely keep on their legs. The moon now &s;hone bright, by the light of which they could &s;ee the &s;heathing boards float from the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el; till at length the fal&s;e keel followed, &s;o that they expected in&s;tant de&s;truction. Their be&s;t chance of e&s;|caping &s;eemed now to be by lightening her; but as they had &s;truck at high water, they would
<PB N="429" REF="452">
have been but in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, after the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould draw as much le&s;s water as the water had &s;unk: but their anxiety abated a lit|tle, on finding that the &s;hip &s;ettled to the rocks as the tide ebbed. They, however, flattered them&s;elves, that if the &s;hip &s;hould keep toge|ther till next tide, they might have &s;ome chance of floating her. They therefore in&s;tantly &s;tarted the water in the hold, and pumped it up. The decayed &s;tores, oil jars, ca&s;ks, balla&s;t, &s;ix of their guns, and other things, were thrown over-board, in order to get at the heavier articles; and in this bu&s;ine&s;s they were employed till day-break, during all which time it was ob&s;erved, that not an oath was &s;worn; &s;o much were the minds of the &s;ailors impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of their danger.</P>
<P>At day-light they &s;aw land at eight leagues di&s;tance; but not a &s;ingle i&s;land between them and the main, on which part of the crew might have been landed, while the boat went on &s;hore with the re&s;t; &s;o that the de&s;truction of the greater part of them would have been inevita|ble, had the &s;hip gone to pieces. It happened, however, that the wind died away to a dead calm before noon. As they expected high wa|ter at eleven o'clock, every thing was prepared to make another effort to free the &s;hip; but the tide fell &s;o much &s;hort of that in the night, that &s;he did not float by eighteen inches, though they had thrown over-board near fifty tons
<PB N="430" REF="453">
weight: they now, therefore, renewed their toil, and threw over-board every thing that could be po&s;&s;ibly &s;pared. As the tide fell, the water poured in &s;o rapidly, that they could &s;carcely keep her free by the con&s;tant working of two pumps. Their only hope now depended on the midnight tide, and preparations were accordingly made for another effort to get the &s;hip off. The tide began to ri&s;e at five o'clock, when the leak likewi&s;e encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that two more pumps were manned; but only one of them would work: three, therefore, were kept going till nine o'clock, at which time the &s;hip righted; but &s;o much water had been admitted by the leak, that they expected &s;he would &s;ink as &s;oon as the water &s;hould bear her off the rock. Their &s;ituation was now deplorable be|yond de&s;cription; and the imagination mu&s;t paint what would baffle the powers of language to de&s;cribe. They knew that when the fatal moment &s;hould arrive, all authority would be at an end. The boats were incapable of convey|ing them all on &s;hore; and they dreaded a con|te&s;t for the preference, as more &s;hocking than the &s;hipwreck it&s;elf: yet it was con&s;idered, that tho&s;e who might be left on board, would even|tually meet with a milder fate than tho&s;e who, by gaining the &s;hore, would have no chance but to linger the remains of life among the rude&s;t &s;avages in the univer&s;e, and in a country, where
<PB N="431" REF="454">
fire-arms would barely enable them to &s;upport a wretched exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>At twenty minutes after ten the &s;hip floated, and was heaved into deep water; when they were happy to find that &s;he did not admit more water than &s;he had done before; yet as the leak had for a con&s;iderable time gained on the pumps, there was now three feet nine inches water in the hold. By this time the men were &s;o worn by fatigue of mind and body, that none of them could pump more than five or &s;ix mi|nutes at a time, and then threw them&s;elves, quite &s;pent, on the deck, amid&s;t a &s;tream of water which came from the pumps The &s;uc|ceeding man being fatigued in his turn, threw him&s;elf down in the &s;ame manner, while the former jumped up and renewed his labour; thus mutually &s;truggling for life, till the following accident had like to have given them up a prey to ab&s;olute de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Between the in&s;ide lining of the &s;hip's bot|tom, which is called the ceiling, and the out&s;ide planking, there is a &s;pace of about &s;eventeen or eighteen inches The man who had hitherto taken the depth of water at the well, had taken it no farther than the ceiling; but being now relieved by another per&s;on, who took the depth to the out&s;ide planking, it appeared by this mi&s;|take, that the leak had &s;uddenly gained upon the pumps, the whole difference between the two plankings.&mdash;This circum&s;tance deprived them
<PB N="432" REF="455">
of all hopes, and &s;carce any one thought it worth while to labour, for the longer pre&s;erva|tion of a life which mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon have a pe|riod: but the mi&s;take was &s;oon di&s;covered; and the joy ari&s;ing from &s;uch unexpected good news in&s;pired the men with &s;o much vigour, that be|fore eight o'clock in the morning they had pumped out con&s;iderably more water than they had &s;hipped. They now talked confidently of getting the &s;hip into &s;ome harbour; and &s;et heartily to work to get in their anchors; one of which, and the cable of another, they lo&s;t: but the&s;e were now con&s;idered as trifles. Having a good breeze from the &s;ea, they got under &s;ail at eleven o'clock, and &s;tood for the land.</P>
<P>As they could not di&s;cover the exact &s;ituation of the leak, they had no pro&s;pect of &s;topping it within &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el; but the following expedient, which one of the Mid&s;hipmen had formerly &s;een tried with &s;ucce&s;s, was adopted. They took an old &s;tudding &s;ail, and having mixed a large quantity of oakham and wool, chopped &s;mall, it was &s;titched down in hand|fuls on the &s;ail, as lightly as po&s;&s;ible; the dung of their &s;heep and other filth being &s;pread over it. Thus prepared, the &s;ail was hauled under the &s;hip by ropes, which kept it extended till it came under the leak, when the &s;uction carried in the oakham and wool from the &s;urface of the &s;ail. This experiment &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that,
<PB N="433" REF="456">
in&s;tead of three pumps, the water was ea&s;ily kept under with one.</P>
<P>They had hitherto had no further view than to run the &s;hip into an harbour, and build a ve&s;&s;el from her materials, in which they might reach the Ea&s;t Indies; but they now began to think of finding a proper place to repair her damage, and then to pur&s;ue their voyage on its original plan. At &s;ix in the evening they an|chored &s;even leagues from the &s;hore; and found that the &s;hip made fifteen inches water an hour during the night; but as the pumps could clear this quantity, they were not unea&s;y. At nine in the morning they pa&s;&s;ed two i&s;lands, which were called HOPE ISLANDS, becau&s;e the reach|ing of them had been the object of their wi&s;hes at the time of the &s;hipwreck. In the afternoon the Ma&s;ter was &s;ent out with two boats to &s;ound, and &s;earch for a harbour where the &s;hip might be repaired. They anchored at &s;un-&s;et, in four fathom, two miles from the &s;hore. One of the Mates being out in the pinnace, returned at nine o'clock, reporting, that he had found ju&s;t &s;uch a harbour as was wanted, at the di&s;tance of two leagues.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock the next morning they &s;ailed, having previou&s;ly &s;ent two boats a-head, to lie on the &s;hoals that they &s;aw in their way. They &s;oon anchored about a mile from the &s;hore, when the Captain went out, and found the channel very narrow, but the harbour was bet|ter
<PB N="434" REF="457">
adapted to their pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, than any place they had &s;een in the whole cour&s;e of their voyage. As it blew very fre&s;h this day and the following night, they could not venture to run into the harbour, but remained at anchor dur|ing the two &s;ucceeding days, in the cour&s;e of which they ob&s;erved four Indians on the hills, who &s;topped and made two fires.</P>
<P>The men by this time began to be afflicted with the &s;curvy, and their Indian friend, Tu|pia, was &s;o bad with it, that he had livid &s;pots on both his legs. Mr. Green, the a&s;tronomer, was likewi&s;e ill of the &s;ame di&s;order; &s;o that their being detained from landing was every way di&s;agreeable. The wind continued fre&s;h till Sunday the 17th, but they then re&s;olved to pu&s;h in for the harbour, and twice ran the &s;hip a-ground; the &s;econd time of which &s;he &s;tuck fa&s;t; on which they took the booms, fore|yard, and fore top-ma&s;ts down, and made a raft on the &s;ide of the &s;hip; and, as the tide hap|pened to be ri&s;ing, &s;he floated at one o'clock. She was now &s;oon got into the harbour, where &s;he was moored along the &s;ide of a beach, and the anchors, cables, &amp;c. immediately taken out of her.</P>
<P>On Monday morning they erected a tent for the &s;ick, &s;everal of whom were brought on &s;hore as &s;oon as it was ready for their reception. They likewi&s;e built a tent to hold the provi&s;i|ons and &s;tores, which were landed the &s;ame day.
<PB N="435" REF="458">
The boat was now di&s;patched in &s;earch of fi&s;h for the refre&s;hment of the &s;ick, but &s;he return|ed without getting any; but Tupia employed him&s;elf in angling; and living entirely on the produce of his indu&s;try, recovered his health very fa&s;t. Mr. Banks, in an excur&s;ion up the country, &s;aw the frames of &s;everal Indian hou&s;es, which appeared to have been abandoned &s;ome time: while the Captain, having a&s;cended one of the highe&s;t hills, ob&s;erved the high land to be &s;toney and barren, and the low land near the river over-run with mangroves, among which the &s;alt-water flowed every tide.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the Captain ordered the &s;mith's forge to be &s;et up, and directed the armourer to prepare the nece&s;&s;ary iron work for the repair of the ve&s;&s;el. He likewi&s;e ordered out the of|ficers &s;tores, water, &amp;c. in order to lighten the &s;hip. This day Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed the river to view the country, which was little el&s;e than &s;and-hills. He &s;aw va&s;t flocks of crows and pigeons, of the latter of which he &s;hot &s;everal, which were mo&s;t beautiful birds. On the day following, as they were removing the coals, the water ru&s;hed in, near the forema&s;t, about three feet from the keel; &s;o that it was re&s;olved to clear the hold entirely; wherefore they took out all the coals, and the next day warped the &s;hip higher up the harbour, to a &s;tation proper for laying her a-&s;hore, in order to &s;top the leak.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="459">Early in the morning of the 22d the tide left the &s;hip, and they proceeded to examine the leak, when they found that the rocks had cut through four planks into the timbers, and that three other planks were damaged. In the&s;e breaches not a &s;plinter was to be &s;een, the whole being &s;mooth, as if cut away by an in&s;trument: but the pre&s;ervation of the ve&s;&s;el was owing to a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance. One of the holes was large enough to have &s;unk her, even with eight pumps con&s;tantly at work; but this hole was in a great mea&s;ure &s;topped up by the fragment of the rock being left &s;ticking in it. They likewi&s;e found &s;ome pieces of the oak|ham, wool, &amp;c. which had got between the timbers, and &s;topped many parts of the leak which had been left open by the &s;tone. Exclu|&s;ive of the leak, great damage was done to various parts of the &s;hip's bottom.</P>
<P>While the &s;miths were engaged in making nails and bolts, the carpenters began to work on the ve&s;&s;el; and &s;ome of the crew were &s;ent acro&s;s the river to &s;hoot pigeons for the &s;ick. The&s;e people found a &s;tream of fre&s;h water, di&s;cover|ed many Indian hou&s;es, and had &s;ight of a mou&s;e-coloured animal, extremely &s;wift, and about the &s;ize of a greyhound. On the 23d they &s;aw plenty of fi&s;h, but catched only three. This day many of the crew &s;aw the animal a|bove-mentioned; and one of the &s;eamen de|clared he had &s;een the Devil, which he de&s;cribed
<PB N="437" REF="460">
in the following words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He was as large, &s;ays he, as a one gallon keg, and very like it; he had horns and wings, yet he crept &s;o &s;lowly through the gra&s;s, that if I had not been <HI>afeard,</HI> I might have touched him."</Q> It ap|peared afterwards, that this poor fellow had &s;een a bat, which is almo&s;t black, and as large as a partridge; and his own apprehen&s;ions had furni&s;hed his Devil with horns.</P>
<P>The repairs on the &s;tarboard &s;ide having been fini&s;hed the preceding day, the carpenters be|gan to work under the larboard bow, on Sun|day the 24th.&mdash;This day Mr. Gore and a party procured a bunch or two of wild plantains, and a few palm cabbages, for the refre&s;hment of the &s;ick; and the Captain and Mr. Banks &s;aw the animal abovementioned, which had a long tail, that it carried like a greyhound; it leapt like a deer, and the point of its foot re&s;em|bled that of a goat.</P>
<P>The &s;hip was now examined abaft, when it was di&s;covered, that &s;he had received but little injury in that quarter. The carpenters conti|nued to work on her whenever the tide would permit. The ve&s;&s;el was now in a po&s;ition which threw all the water abaft; and Mr. Banks hav|ing removed his whole collection of plants into the bread-room, they were this day found un|der water, by which &s;ome of them were totally de&s;troyed; but, by great care, mo&s;t of them were re&s;tored to a &s;tate of pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="461">The &s;hip being in part repaired, they twice attempted to float her, by la&s;hing a number of ca&s;ks under her bottom; but their endeavours proving fruitle&s;s, they were obliged to wait for the next &s;pring tide. This day a plant was found, the leaves of which were almo&s;t as good as &s;pinnage. They likewi&s;e found more cab|bage trees, &s;ome wild plantain, and a fruit of a deep purple colour, and the &s;ize of a golden pippin; which, after being kept a few days, ta&s;ted like a dam&s;on.</P>
<P>The carpenter was now engaged in caulking the &s;hip, and the men employed in filling water and other nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s; while the Captain amu&s;ed him&s;elf in catching fi&s;h for the &s;ick. On the 28th Mr. Banks took &s;ome of the crew up the country, to &s;hew them a plant which &s;erved them for greens, and which the inhabi|tants of the We&s;t Indies call Indian kale. Here they &s;aw a tree notched for climbing, in the &s;ame way as tho&s;e &s;een in Botany bay. They al&s;o met with ne&s;ts of white ants, from a few inches to five feet in height. Mr. Gore was up the country, where he &s;aw prints of the feet of men, and the tracks of three or four kinds of animals.</P>
<P>On the day following the boat took as many fi&s;h as allowed a pound and an half to each man. A Mid&s;hipman &s;aw a wolf, exactly re|&s;embling tho&s;e of America. On the 30th the Captain a&s;cended a hill to take a view of the
<PB N="439" REF="462">
&s;ea, when, to his great concern, he ob&s;erved innumerable &s;and-banks and &s;hoals, in every direction; but there was an appearance of a pa&s;&s;age to the northward, the only way he could think of getting clear, as the wind con|&s;tantly blows from the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Mr. Gore this day &s;aw two &s;traw-coloured animals, of the &s;ize of a hare, but &s;haped like a dog. So much fi&s;h was taken, that each man had two pounds and a half; and plenty of greens were gathered, which being boiled with the pea&s;e, their fare was deemed excellent.</P>
<P>On Sunday July the 1&s;t, all the men had per|mi&s;&s;ion to go on &s;hore, except one from each me&s;s, who went on the fi&s;hing party, and again met with great &s;ucce&s;s. A fire was this day ob&s;erved about a mile up the river. The ma&s;|ter having been &s;ent in the pinnace, in &s;earch of a channel, returned on Tue&s;day, with an account that he had found a pa&s;&s;age out to &s;ea, between the &s;hoals, which con&s;i&s;ted of co|ral rocks, many of which were left dry at low water. He found &s;ome cockles &s;o large, that one of them was more than &s;ufficient for two men; and likewi&s;e plenty of other &s;hell-fi&s;h, of which he brought a &s;upply to the &s;hip, in his return to which he had landed in a bay where &s;ome Indians were at &s;upper; but they in&s;tantly fled, leaving &s;ome &s;ea-eggs, and a fire for the dre&s;&s;ing them. This day they &s;ucceeded in an attempt to float the &s;hip; when they found that,
<PB N="440" REF="463">
by the po&s;ition &s;he had lain in, &s;he had &s;prung a plank, &s;o that it was again nece&s;&s;ary to lay her a&s;hore. An alligator &s;wam by her &s;everal times this day.</P>
<P>On the 4th &s;he was laid a&s;hore on a &s;and-bank, and the next day floated at high water, and moored off the beach, in order to receive the &s;tores on board. This day Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed the harbour, and found, on a &s;andy beach, a great number of fruits, &s;uch as they had not &s;een before; among which was a cocoa-nut, which Tupia &s;aid had been opened by a crab, and which was judged to be what the Dutch call <HI>Beurs Krabbe.</HI> The vegetable &s;ub&s;tances which Mr. Banks picked up were encru&s;ted with marine productions, which is &s;aid to be a proof of their having been brought far by &s;ea.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and a party having taken a boat up the river, on the 6th, with a view to make an excur&s;ion in the country, returned on the 8th.&mdash;They examined &s;ome parts of the coun|try, which differing but little from what they had already &s;een, they followed the cour&s;e of the river, which they at length found contracted into a narrow channel, bounded by &s;teep banks, which were adorned with trees of a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, among which was the bark-tree. The land was low and covered with gra&s;s, and &s;eemed capable of being culti|vated to great advantage. They &s;aw &s;everal animals, one of which was judged to be a wolf.
<PB N="441" REF="464">
At night they made a fire, and took up their quarters on the banks of the river; but the night was rendered extremely di&s;agreeable by the &s;tings of the mu&s;quitos, which pur&s;ued them into the &s;moke, and almo&s;t into the fire. At break of day they &s;at out in &s;earch of game, and &s;aw four animals, two of which were chaced by Mr. Banks's greyhound; but they greatly out&s;tripped him in &s;peed, by leaping over the long thick gra&s;s, which incommoded the dog in running. It was ob&s;erved of this animal, that he leaped or bounded forward on two legs, in&s;tead of running on four. Having returned to the boat, they proceeded up the river, till it contracted to a brook of fre&s;h wa|ter, but in which the tide &s;till ro&s;e con&s;iderably. When they &s;topped for the night, they &s;aw a &s;moke at a &s;mall di&s;tance, on which three of them approached it, but the Indians were gone. They &s;aw the impre&s;&s;ion of feet on the &s;and, below high-water mark, and found a fire &s;till burning in the hollow of an old tree. At a &s;mall di&s;tance they &s;aw &s;everal huts, and ob&s;erv|ed ovens dug in the ground; the remains of a recent meal were likewi&s;e apparent. They now retired to their re&s;ting-place, and &s;lept on plan|tain-leaves, with bunches of gra&s;s for their pillows, on the &s;ide of a &s;and-bank, under the &s;helter of a bu&s;h.</P>
<P>The tide favouring their return in the morn|ing, they lo&s;t no time in getting back to the
<PB N="442" REF="465">
&s;hip. The ma&s;ter, who had been &s;even leagues at &s;ea, returned &s;oon after Mr. Banks, bringing with him three turtle, which he took with a boat-hook, and which together weighed near eight hundred pounds. He was &s;ent out next morning, and Mr. Banks accompanied him with proper in&s;truments for catching turtle; but, not being &s;ucce&s;sful, he would not go back that night; &s;o that Mr. Banks, after collecting &s;ome &s;hells and marine productions, returned in his own &s;mall boat.</P>
<P>In the morning the &s;econd Lieutenant was &s;ent to bring the Ma&s;ter back, &s;oon after which four Indians, in a &s;mall canoe, were within &s;ight. The Captain now determined to take no notice of the&s;e people, as the mo&s;t likely way to be noticed by them. This project an&s;wered: two of them came within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of the ve&s;&s;el, where they conver&s;ed very loud: in re|turn the people on board &s;houted, and made &s;igns of invitation. The Indians gradually ap|proached, with their lances held up, not in a menacing manner, but as if they meant to inti|mate they were capable of defending them&s;elves. They came almo&s;t along-&s;ide, when the Captain threw them cloth, nails, paper, &amp;c. which did not &s;eem to attract their notice. At length one of the &s;ailors threw them a &s;mall fi&s;h, which &s;o plea&s;ed them, that they hinted their de&s;ign of bringing their companions, and immediately rowed for the &s;hore. In the interim, Tupia
<PB N="443" REF="466">
and &s;ome of the crew landed on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. The four Indians now came quite along-&s;ide the &s;hip; and having received farther pre|&s;ents, landed where Tupia and the &s;ailors had gone. They had each two lances, and a &s;tick with which they throw them. Advancing to|wards the Engli&s;h, Tupia per&s;uaded them to lay down their arms, and &s;it by him, which they readily did. Others of the crew now going a|&s;hore, the Indians &s;eemed jealous, lea&s;t they &s;hould get between them and their arms; but care was taken to convince them that no &s;uch thing was intended, and more trifles were pre|&s;ented to them. The crew &s;taid with them till dinner-time, and then made &s;igns of invitation for them to go to the &s;hip and eat; but this they declined, and retired in their canoe.</P>
<P>The&s;e men were of the common &s;tature, with very &s;mall limbs; their complexion a deep chocolate; their hair black, either lank or curled, but not of the wool kind; the brea&s;t and upper lip of one of them were painted with &s;treaks of white, which he called <HI>Carbanda,</HI> and &s;ome parts of their bodies had been painted red. Their teeth were white and even, their eyes bright, and their features rather plea&s;ing: their voices were mu&s;ical, and they repeated &s;e|veral Engli&s;h words with great readine&s;s.</P>
<P>The vi&s;it of three of the&s;e Indians was re|newed the next morning, and they brought with them a fourth, whom they called YAPA|RICO;
<PB N="444" REF="467">
who appeared to be a per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;equence. The bone of a bird, about &s;ix inches long, was thru&s;t through the gri&s;tle of his no&s;e: and indeed all the inhabitants of this place had their no&s;es bored, for the reception of &s;uch an ornament. The&s;e people being all naked, the Captain gave one of them an old &s;hirt, which he bound round his head like a turban, in&s;tead of u&s;ing it to cover any part of his body. They brought a fi&s;h to the &s;hip, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in payment for that given them the preceding day: after &s;taying &s;ome time, with apparent &s;atisfaction, they &s;ud|denly leaped into their canoe, and rowed off, from a jealou&s;y of &s;ome of the gentlemen who were examining it.</P>
<P>Three Indians vi&s;ited Tupia's tent on the 12th of July, and after remaining &s;ome time, one of them went for two others, whom he in|troduced by name. Some fi&s;h was offered them, but they &s;eemed not much to regard it, and, after eating a little, gave the remainder to Mr. Banks's dog. Some ribbands which had been given them, to which medals were &s;u&s;pended round their necks, were &s;o changed by &s;moke, that it was difficult to judge what colour they had been; and the &s;moke had made their &s;kins look darker than their natural colour; from whence it was thought that they &s;lept clo&s;e to their fires, as a preventative again&s;t the &s;ting of the mu&s;quitos. Both the &s;trangers had bones
<PB N="445" REF="468">
through their no&s;es, and a piece of bark tied over the forehead; and one of them had an ornament of &s;trings round his arm, and an ele|gant necklace made of &s;hells. Their canoe was about ten feet long, and calculated to hold four per&s;ons; and when it was in &s;hallow wa|ter they moved it by means of poles. Their lances had only a &s;ingle point, and &s;ome of them were barbed with fi&s;h-bones. On the 14th Mr. Gore &s;hot one of the mou&s;e-coloured animals abovementioned. It chanced to be a young one, weighing no more than thirty-eight pounds; but when full grown they are as large as a &s;heep. The &s;kin of this bea&s;t, which is called <HI>Kanguroo,</HI> is covered with &s;hort fur, and is of a dark mou&s;e-colour: the head and ears are &s;omewhat like tho&s;e of a hare: this animal was dre&s;&s;ed for dinner, and proved fine eating. The &s;hip's crew fed on turtle almo&s;t every day, which were finer than tho&s;e eaten in England, owing to their being killed before their natural fat was wa&s;ted, and their juices changed.</P>
<P>On the 17th Me&s;&s;rs. Banks and Solander went with the Captain into the woods, and &s;aw four Indians in a canoe, who went on &s;hore, and walked up without &s;ign of fear. They accepted &s;ome beads, and departed, inti|mating, that they did not chu&s;e to be followed. The natives being now become familiar with the &s;hip's crew, one of them was de&s;ired to
<PB N="446" REF="469">
throw his lance, which he did with &s;uch dex|terity and force, that though it was not above four feet from the ground at the highe&s;t, it pe|netrated deeply into a tree at the di&s;tance of fifty yards. The natives now went on board the &s;hip, and were well plea&s;ed with their en|tertainment. On the 19th they &s;aw &s;everal of the women, who, as well as the men, were quite naked. They were this day vi&s;ited by ten of the natives, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to have one of the turtle that was on board, which they repeatedly made &s;igns for, and being as repeatedly refu&s;ed, they expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t rage and re&s;entment; and one of them, in par|ticular, having received a denial from Mr. Banks, he &s;tamped, and pu&s;hed him away in the mo&s;t violent manner. At length they laid hands on two of the turtles, and drew them to the &s;ide of the &s;hip where their canoe lay; but the &s;ailors took them away. They made &s;everal &s;imilar attempts, but being equally un|&s;ucce&s;sful, they leaped &s;uddenly into their ca|noe, and rowed off. At this in&s;tant the Cap|tain, with Mr. Banks, and five or &s;ix &s;eamen, went a&s;hore, where they arrived before the In|dians, and where many of the crew were al|ready employed. As &s;oon as the Indians landed, one of them &s;natched a fire-brand from under a pitch kettle, and running to the windward of what effects were on &s;hore, &s;et fire to the dry gra&s;s, which burnt rapidly, &s;corched a pig to
<PB N="447" REF="470">
death, burnt part of the &s;mith's forge, and would have de&s;troyed a tent of Mr. Banks's, but that &s;ome people came from the &s;hip ju&s;t in time to get it out of the way of the flames. In the interim the Indians went to a place where the fi&s;hing nets lay, and a quantity of linen was laid out to dry, and there again &s;et fire to the gra&s;s, in &s;pite of all per&s;ua&s;ion, and even of threats. A mu&s;ket loaded with &s;mall &s;hot was now fired, and one of them being wounded, they ran away, and this &s;econd fire was ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed; but the other burnt far into the woods.</P>
<P>The natives continuing &s;till in &s;ight, a mu&s;|quet charged with ball was fired near them; upon hearing which they &s;oon got out of &s;ight: but their voices being &s;oon heard in the woods, and &s;eeming to come nearer, the Captain, with a few people, went to meet them. When they were in &s;ight of each other, both parties &s;top|ped, except an old Indian, who advanced be|fore the re&s;t a little way, but &s;oon halted, and &s;peaking a few words, retreated to his brethren, and they all retired &s;lowly together. The Eng|li&s;h having &s;eized &s;ome of their darts, followed them about a mile, and then &s;at down, the In|dians &s;itting about an hundred yards from them. The old man again came forward, having in his hand a lance with a point. He &s;topped and &s;poke &s;everal times, on which the Captain made &s;igns of friend&s;hip. The old Indian now
<PB N="448" REF="471">
turned to his companions, and having &s;poken to them, they placed their lances again&s;t a tree, and came forward as in friend&s;hip; whereupon their darts which had been taken were returned, and the whole quarrel &s;eemed to be at an end. The Indians having accepted &s;ome trinkets, walked amicably toward the coa&s;t, intimating, by &s;igns, that they would not fire the gra&s;s again. They &s;at down oppo&s;ite the &s;hip, but would not go on board; and they accepted a few mu&s;quet-balls, the u&s;e and effect of which the Captain endeavoured to explain to them. When Captain Cook got on board he &s;aw the woods burning at the di&s;tance of two miles.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter having been &s;ent to &s;earch for a pa&s;&s;age to the northward, returned with an ac|count that he could not find any. By the night of the 20th the fire had extended many miles round them on the hills, which at night formed an appearance that was very &s;triking. On the 22d they killed a turtle, through both &s;houlders of which &s;tuck a wooden harpoon, which the Indians had &s;triken it with, and the wound was quite healed. The next day one of the &s;eamen, who had &s;trayed from his company, met with four Indians at dinner: he was alarmed at this unexpected meeting, but had prudence enough to conceal his apprehen&s;ions, and &s;itting down by them, gave them his knife, which having all looked at, they returned: he would then have left them; but they cho&s;e to detain him till, by
<PB N="449" REF="472">
feeling his hands and face, they were convinced he was made of fle&s;h and blood like them&s;elves: they then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, directing him the near|e&s;t way to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks having gone on &s;hore in &s;earch of plants, found the cloth, which had been di&s;tri|buted among the natives, lying in a heap, as a commodity of no value. On the 24th, Me&s;&s;rs. Solander and Banks found &s;everal marking nuts [the <HI>Anacardium orientale</HI>] on the ground; but their &s;earch for the tree that bore them was fruitle&s;s. On the 26th Mr. Banks catched a female animal, called the <HI>Opo&s;&s;um,</HI> with two young ones.</P>
<P>By the 29th the &s;hip was ready for &s;ea; but there was not water &s;ufficient for her to pa&s;s the bar. On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t they found that their pumps were all rotten; but as the &s;hip admitted only an inch of water in an hour, they hoped &s;he would be &s;tout enough to bear the voyage. On the 4th of this month they put to &s;ea, the pinnace going a-head to keep &s;ounding, and at noon came to an anchor, when the Cap|tain gave the name of CAPE BEDFORD to the northermo&s;t point of land in &s;ight, and that of ENDEAVOUR RIVER to the harbour which they had quitted.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ions they obtained while in this harbour, con&s;i&s;ted of turtle, which they went &s;ome miles to &s;ea to catch; oy&s;ters of three dif|ferent &s;orts, large cavalhe or &s;comber, large
<PB N="450" REF="473">
mullets, &s;ome flat fi&s;h, a great number of &s;mall &s;combri, and &s;kate or ray fi&s;h; pur&s;lain, wild beans, the tops of coccos, and cabbage palms. Of quadrupedes there are goats, wolves, and pole-cats, and a &s;potted animal of the viverra kind; and &s;everal kinds of &s;erpents, only &s;ome of which are venomous. Dogs are the only tame animals; the land-fowls are kites, crows, hawks, loriquets, cockatoos, parrots, pigeons, and &s;mall birds of various kinds, the names of which were not known: the water-fowls are wild gee&s;e, curlieus, hens, whi&s;tling ducks, which perch on trees, and &s;ome few others. The &s;oil produces the gum tree, and various o|ther kinds of wood, and coar&s;e gra&s;s: the whole of the country is well watered, and ant hills abound in every part of it.</P>
<P>On the 4th the Captain a&s;cended to the ma&s;t-head, to look at &s;ome &s;hoals which threatened great danger; and he &s;aw &s;everal of them above the water. This day &s;uch a quantity of fi&s;h was catched, as allowed a dividend of two pounds to each man. During the &s;ix following days they &s;truggled ince&s;&s;antly to &s;ail &s;afely pa&s;t the &s;hoals and breakers, by which they were every way &s;urrounded; but, for the pre&s;ent, their at|tempts were vain. On the 10th they were be|tween a head-land, and three i&s;lands, which had been di&s;covered on the preceding day; and be|gan to conceive hopes that they were out of danger; but this not proving the ca&s;e, the head-land
<PB N="451" REF="474">
received the name of CAPE FLATTERY. Some land was now &s;een from the ma&s;t-head, which was generally taken for the main; but the Captain judged it to be a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands; and during this diver&s;ity of opinion, the &s;hip came to an anchor. The Captain now landed, and a&s;cending a high point, took a &s;urvey of the &s;ea coa&s;t, by which he was confirmed in his opinion, that what they had &s;een was not any part of the main, but a number of i&s;lands. On the point where he &s;tood were &s;een the prints of human feet, in white &s;and of an ex|qui&s;ite finene&s;s, and the &s;pot was denominated POINT LOOKOUT.</P>
<P>Early on the 11th Mr. Banks and the Cap|tain went to vi&s;it the large&s;t of three i&s;lands, which had been &s;een from the point the pre|ceding day. Having gained the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t hill, they beheld a reef of rocks, on which the &s;ea broke in a frightful manner; but the thickne&s;s of the weather preventing a per|fect view, they lodged under a bu&s;h during the night, in the hope of having a better pro&s;pect in the morning; but the weather then proved wor&s;e than it had been on the preceding day; yet, as they &s;aw what had the appearance of a channel between the reefs, a per&s;on was &s;ent to examine it, who found it very narrow. They now &s;et out to return to the &s;hip, after giving the name of LIZARD ISLAND to this place,
<PB N="452" REF="475">
from their having &s;een no animals but lizards on it.</P>
<P>On their return they landed on a low &s;andy i&s;land, which abounded in birds of various kinds, among which were eagles, a ne&s;t of the young of which they took, and called the place EAGLE ISLAND. On this &s;pot they &s;aw the ne&s;t of &s;ome bird, which was built with &s;ticks on the ground, it was near three feet in height, and twenty-&s;ix round.</P>
<P>During the interval of their ab&s;ence from the &s;hip, the ma&s;ter had landed on &s;everal low i&s;lands, where he had &s;een great heaps of turtle &s;hells, and found the fins of them which the Indians had left hanging on the trees, &s;o fre&s;h, that they were dre&s;&s;ed and eaten by the boat's crew.</P>
<P>After a conver&s;ation held among the officers, it was their concurrent opinion, that it would be be&s;t to leave the coa&s;t, and &s;tand out to &s;ea: and in con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;entiments they &s;ailed on the 13th of Augu&s;t, 1770, and got through one of the channels in the reef; happy to be once more in an open &s;ea, after having been &s;urrounded by dreadful &s;hoals and rocks for near three months. They had now &s;ailed above a thou&s;and miles, during all which run they had been obliged to keep &s;ounding, with|out the intermi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle minute; a cir|cum&s;tance which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, never hap|pened to any &s;hip but the Endeavour.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="476">The i&s;lands from one of which the pa&s;&s;age to the open &s;ea had been ob&s;erved, were called the ISLANDS OF DIRECTION. They abound in turtle and other fi&s;h, and on the beach were found bamboos, cocoa-nuts, pumice-&s;tone, and the &s;eeds of plants, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be carried thither by the trade winds, as the plants them&s;elves do not grow in the country.</P>
<P>Having anchored on the 14th, they &s;teered a we&s;terly cour&s;e on the following day, to get &s;ight of the land, that a pa&s;&s;age between that land and New Guinea might not be mi&s;&s;ed, if there was any &s;uch pa&s;&s;age. Early in the afternoon they had &s;ight of land, which had the appear|ance of hilly i&s;lands, but it was judged to be a part of the main; and they &s;aw breakers be|tween the ve&s;&s;el and the land, in which was an opening, to get clear of which they &s;et all their &s;ails, and &s;tood to the northward till midnight, and then went on a &s;outhward tack for about two miles, when the breeze died away to a dead calm. When day-light came on they &s;aw a dreadful &s;urf break at a va&s;t height within a mile of the &s;hip, towards which the rolling waves carried her with great rapidity. Thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, the boats were &s;ent a-head to tow, and the head of the ve&s;&s;el was brought about, but not till &s;he was within one hundred yards of the rock, between which and her there was nothing left but the cha&s;m, made by the la&s;t wave which had wa&s;hed her &s;ide, and which had ri&s;en and
<PB N="454" REF="477">
broke to a wonderful height on the rock:&mdash;but, in the moment they expected in&s;tant de&s;truction, a breeze, hardly di&s;cernible, aided the boats in getting the ve&s;&s;el in an oblique direction from the rock. The hopes however, afforded by this providential circum&s;tance, were de&s;troyed by a perfect calm which &s;ucceeded in a few minutes; yet the breeze once more returned, before they had lo&s;t the little ground which had been gained.</P>
<P>At this time a &s;mall opening was &s;een in the reef, and a young officer being &s;ent to examine it, found that its breadth did not much exceed the length of the &s;hip, but that there was &s;mooth water on the other &s;ide of the rocks. A|nimated by the hope of pre&s;erving life, they now attempted to pa&s;s the opening; but this was impo&s;&s;ible; for it having become high water in the interim, the ebb tide ru&s;hed through it with amazing impetuo&s;ity, carrying the &s;hip about a quarter of a mile from the reef, and &s;he &s;oon reached the di&s;tance of near two miles, by the help of the boats. When the ebb tide was &s;pent, the tide of flood again drove the ve&s;&s;el very near the rocks, &s;o that their pro&s;pect of de&s;truction was renewed, when they di&s;covered another opening, and a light breeze &s;pringing up, they entered it, and were driven through it with a rapidity that prevented the &s;hip from &s;triking again&s;t either &s;ide of the channel. The &s;hip now came to an anchor, and her crew were
<PB N="455" REF="478">
grateful for having regained a &s;tation, which they had been very lately mo&s;t anxious to quit.</P>
<P>The name of PROVIDENTIAL CHANNEL was given to the opening through which the &s;hip had thus e&s;caped the mo&s;t imminent dangers. A high promontory on the main land in &s;ight, was denominated CAPE WEYMOUTH, and a bay near it WEYMOUTH BAY. This day the boats went out to fi&s;h, and met with great &s;ucce&s;s, particu|larly in catching cockles, &s;ome of which were of &s;uch an amazing &s;ize, as to require the &s;trength of two men to move them. Mr. Banks like|wi&s;e &s;ucceeded in his &s;earch for rare &s;hells, and different kinds of coral.</P>
<P>On the 18th they di&s;covered &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, which were called FORBES'S ISLANDS, and had &s;ight of a high point of land on the main, which was named the BOLT HEAD. On the 19th they di&s;covered &s;everal other &s;mall i&s;lands, the land of which was low, barren, and &s;andy. A point was &s;een, and called CAPE GRENVILLE, and a bay which took the name of TEMPLE BAY. In the afternoon many other i&s;lands were &s;een, which were denominated BIRD ISLES, from their being frequented by nu|merous flocks of birds.</P>
<P>On the 20th many more &s;mall i&s;lands were &s;een, on one of which there were a few trees, and many Indian huts, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been erected by the natives of the main land, as tem|porary habitations during their vi&s;its to the&s;e
<PB N="456" REF="479">
i&s;lands. On the 21&s;t they &s;ailed through a channel, in which was a number of &s;hoals; and gave the name of YORK CAPE to a point of the main land which forms the &s;ide of the chan|nel. A large bay is formed to the &s;outh of the cape, which was called NEWCASTLE BAY, and in which are &s;everal little i&s;lands. On the north &s;ide of the cape the land is rather mountainous, but the low parts of the country abound with trees. The i&s;lands di&s;covered in the morning of this day, were called YORK ISLES. In the afternoon they anchored between &s;ome i&s;lands, and ob&s;erved, that the channel now began to grow wider: they ob&s;erved two di&s;tant points, between which no land could be &s;een, &s;o that the hope of having at length explored a pa&s;&s;age into the Indian &s;ea began to animate every brea&s;t: but, to bring the matter nearer to a certainty, the Captain took a party, and being accompanied by Me&s;&s;rs. Solander and Banks, they landed on an i&s;land, on which they had &s;een a number of Indians, ten of whom were on a hill, one of them carrying a bow, and a bun|dle of arrows, the re&s;t armed with lances; and round the necks of two of them hung &s;trings of mother-of-pearl. Three of the&s;e Indians &s;tood on the &s;hore, as if to oppo&s;e the landing of the boat; but they retired before it reached the beach.</P>
<P>The Captain and his company now a&s;cended a hill, from whence they had a view of near
<PB N="457" REF="480">
forty miles, in which &s;pace there was nothing that threatened to oppo&s;e their pa&s;&s;age; &s;o that the certainty of a channel &s;eemed to be almo&s;t a&s;certained. Previous to their leaving the i&s;land, Captain Cook di&s;played the Engli&s;h colours, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of the country, from the 38th degree of &s;outh-la|titude, to the pre&s;ent &s;pot, by the name of NEW SOUTH WALES, for his Sovereign the King of Great Britain; and three vollies of &s;mall arms being fired, and an&s;wered by an equal num|ber from the <HI>Endeavour,</HI> the place received the name of POSSESSION ISLAND.</P>
<P>The next morning they &s;aw three naked wo|men collecting &s;hell-fi&s;h on the beach; and weighing anchor, gave the name of CAPE CORN|WALL to the extreme point of the large&s;t i&s;land on the north-we&s;t &s;ide of the pa&s;&s;age: &s;ome low i&s;lands near the middle of the channel receiving the name of WALLIS'S ISLES; &s;oon after which the &s;hip came to an anchor, and the long-boat was &s;ent out to found.</P>
<P>Towards evening they &s;ailed again, and the Captain landed with Mr. Banks on a &s;mall i&s;land, which was frequented by immen&s;e num|bers of birds, the majority of which being boo|bies, the place received the name of BOOBY ISLAND. They were now advanced to the nor|thern extremity of New Holland, and had the &s;atisfaction of viewing the open &s;ea to the we&s;t|ward. The north-ea&s;t entrance of the pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="458" REF="481">
is formed by the main land of New Holland, and by a number of i&s;lands which took the name of the PRINCE OF WALES'S ISLANDS, and which Captain Cook imagines may reach to New Guinea: the&s;e i&s;lands abound with trees and gra&s;s, and were known to be inhabited, from the &s;moke that was &s;een a&s;cending in many places.</P>
<P>To the pa&s;&s;age which they had &s;ailed through, Captain Cock gave the name of ENDEAVOUR STREIGHTS; we &s;hall now proceed to a more accurate de&s;cription of the country they had di&s;|covered; with an account of its productions, and of the manners and language of its inha|bitants.</P>
<P>New South Wales is a much larger country than any hitherto known, which is not deemed a continent, being larger than all Europe; which is proved by the Endeavour having coa&s;t|ed more than two thou&s;and miles, even if her tract was reduced to a &s;trait line. Northward of the latitude of thirty-three degrees, the country is hilly, but not mountainous; but to the &s;outhward of that latitude, it is mo&s;tly low and even ground. The hills in general are di|ver&s;ified by lawns and woods, and many of the vallies abound with herbage; though, on the whole, it cannot be deemed a fertile country. To the northward the gra&s;s is not &s;o rich, nor the trees &s;o high as in the &s;outhern parts; and almo&s;t every where, even the large&s;t trees grow
<PB N="459" REF="482">
at a di&s;tance of not le&s;s than thirteen yards a&s;un|der. In all tho&s;e places where the land forms a bay, the &s;hore is covered with mangroves, which grow about a mile inland, in a &s;tinking ground, which the &s;pring tides always overflow. In &s;ome parts there are bogs, covered with thick gra&s;s, and there is plenty of under|wood in the vallies: the &s;oil in general &s;eems unfit for cultivation, though there are many &s;pots where the arts of tillage might be attend|ed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Salt creeks run in many directions through the country, which likewi&s;e abounds in &s;prings and brooks of fre&s;h water, but has no rivers of any con&s;iderable &s;ize; yet it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon the whole well watered, as the time when the &s;hip was on the coa&s;t, was the drie&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year. All parts of the country produce the gum tree, which yields a re&s;in like the <HI>&s;an|guis draconis.</HI></P>
<P>There are palm-trees of three kinds, two of which are found only in the northern di&s;trict. One of the&s;e produces nuts re&s;embling che&s;nuts, the hulls of which being &s;ound near where the natives had made fires, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that they were eatable; but &s;ome of the &s;eamen having eaten of them, were taken very ill: upon which they were given to the hogs, but two of the&s;e died in about a week, and it was a work of difficulty to recover the re&s;t. The &s;econd &s;ort of palm is much like the true cabbage tree
<PB N="460" REF="483">
of the We&s;t Indies, and yields a large cabbage of a tolerable flavour. The third &s;ort, which abounds in the &s;outhward parts, produces a &s;mall cabbage of the mo&s;t agreeable ta&s;te; and its nuts, which are fine food for hogs, grow in the greate&s;t abundance. This country al&s;o pro|duces a tree, on which grows a kind of purple apple, which ta&s;tes like a dama&s;cen, after keep|ing it a few days:&mdash;a fig-tree, the fruit of which ta&s;tes very indifferently:&mdash;and a tree, the fruit of which is flat on the &s;ides like a chee&s;e, but its colour is that of a plumb.</P>
<P>Among the plants there is one, the leaves of which are like tho&s;e of the bulru&s;h, which yeilds a bright yellow re&s;in, exactly like gam|bouge, but it does not &s;tain: this plant had a very agreeable &s;mell, but it is not known to what u&s;es it might be applied. There are two kinds of yams, one round, and covered with &s;tringy fibres, and the other &s;haped like a ra|di&s;h; but both of them are plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te: be&s;ides the&s;e, the country produces pur|&s;lain, and a kind of wild par&s;ley. A fruit of a bad ta&s;te was found, which re&s;embled a pine|apple, and another, the kernel of which was &s;oft, but it was otherwi&s;e like a cherry.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the quadrupedes already mentioned, there is one, the belly of which is totally white, and the back brown, with white &s;pots: it is much like a polecat, and the Indians call it <HI>Quoll.</HI>&mdash;There are va&s;t numbers of beautiful
<PB N="461" REF="484">
pigeons, many of which were &s;hot by the &s;eamen; and the other land-birds are eagles, hawks, cranes, herons, bu&s;tards, crows, quails, doves, parrots, paroquets, cockatoos, and &s;ome other birds of very elegant plumage.</P>
<P>The in&s;ects are few in number, among which the mu&s;quito and the ant are the chief. The ants are of four kinds. The fir&s;t are perfectly green, and live on trees, in which they build curious ne&s;ts, by bending down the leaves, and gluing them together with an animal juice: thou&s;ands of them joined to keep the leaf in its proper po&s;ition, while many others were em|ployed in the gluing them. Being di&s;turbed in their work, the leaves, which are four or five inches in breadth, flew back with a force which was thought much &s;uperior to the united &s;trength of the&s;e in&s;ects. Tho&s;e who di&s;turbed them paid for their curio&s;ity, by being &s;tung in a very &s;evere manner.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind of ants are quite black, and live in the in&s;ide of the branches of trees, after they have worked out the pith. Some of the branches being gathered, millions of the&s;e animals i&s;&s;ued from every broken twig.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort took up their lodging in the root of a plant that twines round the trunk of other trees. This root, which they hollowed for their purpo&s;e, was cut into great numbers of pa&s;&s;ages which ran acro&s;s each other; yet the plant appeared not to have been injured.
<PB N="462" REF="485">
The&s;e were not more than half the &s;ize of the red ant of this country, but, upon being di&s;|turbed, they crawled over the body in thou|&s;ands, and put their di&s;turbers to the pain ari|&s;ing from exqui&s;ite tickling.</P>
<P>The fourth kind were like the white ants of the Ea&s;t Indies; and had one &s;ort of ne&s;ts, as big as an half peck loaf, hanging from the boughs of the trees, and compo&s;ed of &s;everal minute parts of vegetables, &s;tuck together by a glutinous matter, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;up|plied from their own bodies. The cells had a communication with each other, and had open|ings which led to other ne&s;ts on the &s;ame tree: they had likewi&s;e a hollow covered pa&s;&s;age to another ne&s;t on the ground, at the root of a different tree from that on which the former ne&s;t was &s;u&s;pended. The ground ne&s;ts are &s;ix feet in height, and almo&s;t as much in breadth; the out&s;ide being plai&s;tered with clay of near two inches in thickne&s;s: the&s;e have a &s;ubterra|neous pa&s;&s;age to the roots of the trees near which they &s;tand; from whence the ants a&s;cend, by covered ways, up the trunk and branches. As the&s;e ground-built hou&s;es are proof again&s;t the inva&s;ion of the rain, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the ants retire to them during the wet &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;eas in the&s;e parts produce variety and plenty of fi&s;h, among which are mullets, &s;ea-crayfi&s;h, and crabs. On the &s;hoals are found the rock, pearl, and other oy&s;ters; and the mo&s;t
<PB N="463" REF="486">
delicate green turtle, be&s;ides tho&s;e enormous cockles which have been already mentioned. Alligators are found in the rivers and &s;alt creeks.</P>
<P>This country does not appear to be inhabited by numbers any way proportioned to its great extent: not above thirty being ever &s;een toge|ther but once, which was when tho&s;e of both &s;exes and all ages got together on a rock off Botany-bay, to view the &s;hip. None of their villages con&s;i&s;ted of more huts than would af|ford &s;helter for fourteen or fifteen men; and the&s;e were the large&s;t numbers that ever a&s;&s;em|bled with a view to attack the Engli&s;h. No part of the country appeared to be cultivated; whence there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be fewer inhabi|tants inland, than on the &s;ea coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The men are well made, of the middle &s;ize, and active in a high degree; but their voices are &s;ort even to effeminacy. Their colour is the chocolate; but they were &s;o covered with dirt, as to look almo&s;t as black as negroes. Their hair is naturally long and black, but they com|monly crop it &s;hort; in &s;ome few in&s;tances it is &s;lightly curled, but in common quite &s;trait. It is always matted with dirt, yet wholly free from lice: their beards are thick and bu&s;hy, but kept &s;hort by &s;inging. The women were &s;een only at a di&s;tance, as the men con&s;tantly left them behind when they cro&s;&s;ed the river.</P>
<P>The chief ornament of the&s;e people is the bone that is thru&s;t through the no&s;e, which
<PB N="464" REF="487">
the &s;ailors whim&s;ically termed their &s;prit&s;ail yard: but be&s;ides this they wore necklaces form|ed of &s;hells, a &s;mall cord tied twice or thrice round the arm between the elbow and the &s;houlder, and a &s;tring of plaited human hair round the wai&s;t. Some few of them had an ornament of &s;hells hanging acro&s;s the brea&s;t. Be&s;ides the&s;e ornaments, they painted their bo|dies and limbs white and red, in &s;tripes of dif|ferent dimen&s;ions; and they had a circle of white round each eye, and &s;pots of it on the face. Their ears were bored, but they did not wear ear-rings.</P>
<P>The&s;e people accepted whatever was given them, but &s;eemed to have no idea of making an adequate return; and they would not part with their ornaments for any thing that was offered in exchange. Their bodies were mark|ed with &s;cars, which they &s;ignified were in re|membrance of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Their huts were built with &s;mall rods, the two ends of which were fixed into the ground, &s;o as to form the figure of an oven; they are covered with pieces of bark and palm-leaves. The door of this building, which is only high enough to &s;it upright in, is oppo&s;ite to the fireplace; they &s;leep with their heels turned up to|wards their heads; and even in this po&s;ture the hut will not hold more than four people. In the nor|thern parts, where the weather was warmer, one &s;ide of the hou&s;es was left open, and the
<PB N="465" REF="488">
other oppo&s;ed to whatever wind might blow at the time&punc; the&s;e huts were only built for tempo|rary u&s;e, and left behind when they removed to other parts of the country; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ir &s;tay was only for a night or two, they had no other protection from the weather than what the gra&s;s and bu&s;hes afforded. While the huts on the main land were turned from the wind, tho&s;e on the i&s;lands were turned towards it; a kind of proof that they vi&s;it the i&s;lands in fine weather, and enjoy the refre&s;hing breeze while they &s;leep.</P>
<P>The&s;e huts are furni&s;hed with a kind of bucket for fetching water, made of an oblong piece of bark tied up at each end with the twig of a tree; and this is the only furniture of the hou&s;e. On their backs they have a kind of ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">, of the &s;ize and form of a cabbage-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, in which they carry the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r fi&s;h hooks and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">es, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">lls of which they make the&s;e hooks, the or|naments which they wear, &s;ome points of darts, and two or three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of paint; and in this nar|row compa&s;s lies all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">hes.</P>
<P>They feed on the kangaroo and on &s;everal kinds of birds, when they can catch them; they likewi&s;e eat ya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">s, and various kinds of fruit, but the principal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">le of their &s;ub&s;i&s;t+ence is fi&s;h. They were frequently ob&s;erved with the leaves of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r mouths, but whether it had the qualities either of tobacco or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">tle could not be known, but it was ob&s;erved not to di&s;colour the teeth or l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

<P><PB N="467" REF="490">The natives of New South Wales make u&s;e of &s;pears or lances; but the&s;e are very differ|ently con&s;tructed: tho&s;e that were &s;een in the &s;outhern parts of the country had four prongs, pointed with bone, and barbed; and the points were rubbed with a hard kind of wax, the &s;moothne&s;s of which made an ea&s;ier pa&s;&s;age into what was &s;truck by them. On the contrary, the lances in the northern parts have only one point: the &s;hafts of them are of different lengths, from eight to fourteen feet, are made of the &s;talk of a plant not unlike a bulru&s;h, and con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal joints let into each other, and tied together. The points of the&s;e lances are &s;ometimes made of fi&s;h-bones, and &s;ome|times of a hard heavy wood: they are barbed with other pieces of wood or bone, &s;o that when they have entered any depth into the body, they cannot be drawn out without tearing the fle&s;h in a &s;hocking manner, or leaving &s;plinters behind them.</P>
<P>When the natives intend to wound at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, they di&s;charge this in&s;tru|ment with a throwing-&s;tick; but if the object be near them, it is thrown from the hand only. The throwing-&s;tick is a piece of &s;mooth, hard, red wood, half an inch thick, two inches broad, and about three feet in length, having a cro&s;s piece near four inches long at one end, and a &s;mall knob at the other. A &s;mall hollow is made in the &s;haft of the lance, near the point,
<PB N="468" REF="491">
and in this hollow the knob is received; but, on being forced forward, it will ea&s;ily &s;lip from it. The lance being placed on this throwing-&s;tick, the Indian holds it over his &s;houlder, &s;hakes it, and then throws both lance and &s;tick with his utmo&s;t power, but as the cro&s;s piece &s;trikes the &s;houlder, the &s;udden jerk &s;tops the &s;tick, while the lance is driven forward with amazing rapidity, and is generally &s;o well aim|ed, that a mark at the di&s;tance of fifty yards is more certainly &s;truck with it, than by a bullet from a gun.</P>
<P>The&s;e people make u&s;e of &s;hields, made of the bark of trees, of about eighteen inches broad, and three feet long. Many trees were &s;een from whence the bark had been taken, and others on which the &s;hields were cut out, but not taken away.</P>
<P>In the northern parts of this coa&s;t, the ca|noes are formed by hollowing out the trunk of a tree; and it was conjectured, that this ope|ration mu&s;t have been performed by fire, as the natives did not appear to have any in&s;trument proper for the purpo&s;e. The canoes are in length about fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">teen feet and &s;o narrow that they would be frequently over&s;et, but that they are provided with an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5+ letters">ger. The natives row them with paddles, u&s;ing both hands in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">ployment.</P>
<P>The canoes in the &s;outhern parts are formed only of a piece of bark four yards long, fa&s;ten|ed
<PB N="469" REF="492">
together at each end, and the middle kept open by pieces of wood pa&s;&s;ing from &s;ide to &s;ide. In deep water the&s;e are rowed by pad|dles, of about a foot and a half in length, the rower having one in each hand; but in &s;hallow water they are pu&s;hed forward by means of a long &s;tick. As the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are extremely light, and draw very little water, the natives run them on the mud banks in &s;earch of &s;hell-fi&s;h, &s;ome of which, it is probable, they broil and eat as &s;oon as they are taken, as it was remark|ed, that in the center of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els there was u&s;ually a fire burning on a quantity of &s;ea-weed.</P>
<P>The natives have no tools but a wooden mal|let, a kind of wedge, and an adze, made of &s;tone, with &s;ome pieces of coral and &s;hells, which may po&s;&s;ibly be applied to the purpo&s;es of cutting. They poli&s;h the points of their lances, and their throwing-&s;ticks, with the leaves of a tree that appears to be the ficus ri|duola, or wild fig, which bites with a &s;harp|ne&s;s, almo&s;t equal to that of a ra&s;p.</P>
<P>Four people is the greate&s;t number that a canoe will contain, and when more than this number were to pa&s;s a river, three were landed out of the fir&s;t freight, and one man went back <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">r the re&s;t.</P>
<P>That the natives of this country &s;ometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ge war with each other is evident, from their being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;hields and weapons; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ot a &s;ingle wound was &s;een on any of their bo|dies:
<PB N="470" REF="493">
and, if they are neither de&s;troyed in war, nor carried off by famine, it will be difficult to form a judgment by what means the number of the inhabitants are &s;o reduced, as to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the products of the country: after all, it will, perhaps, be be&s;t to attribute this circum&s;tance to the wi&s;dom of that Providence, which di&s;tri|butes all its ble&s;&s;ings with the mo&s;t unbounded goodne&s;s, and the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom.</P>
