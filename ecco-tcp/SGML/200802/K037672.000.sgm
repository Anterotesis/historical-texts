<P>IT may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the reader, that the author has ventured to make Polydore a per&s;on of the Drama, on the autho|rity of Hyginus, a Greek grammarian, who tells us in one of his fables, that Ilione, by a feigned murder, deceived Polyme&s;tor, and pre&s;erved her brother's life.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. LLOYD.</BYLINE>
<STAGE>And &s;poken by Mr. GARRICK.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L>A Grecian bard, two thou&s;and years ago,</L>
<L>Plan'd this &s;ad fable, of illu&s;trious woe;</L>
<L>Waken'd each &s;oft emotion of the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And call'd forth tears, that would not be &s;uppre&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, O ye mighty &s;irs, of judgement cha&s;te,</L>
<L>Who, lacking genius, have a deal of ta&s;te,</L>
<L>Can you forgive our modern ancient piece,</L>
<L>Which brings no chorus, tho' it comes from Greece;</L>
<L>Kind &s;ocial chorus, which all humours meets,</L>
<L>And &s;ings and dances, up and down the &s;treets.</L>
<L>&mdash; Oh! might true ta&s;te in the&s;e uncla&s;&s;ic days,</L>
<L>Revive the Grecian fa&s;hions, with their plays!</L>
<L>Then rais'd on &s;tilts, our player's would &s;talk and rage,</L>
<L>And at three &s;teps, &s;tride o'er a modern &s;tage;</L>
<L>Each ge&s;ture then would boa&s;t unu&s;ual charms,</L>
<L>From lengthen'd legs, &s;tuff'd body, &s;prawling arms!</L>
<L>Your critic eye would then no pigmies &s;ee,</L>
<L>But bu&s;kin's make a giant, ev'n of <HI>Me.</HI></L>
<L>No features then the poet's mind would trace,</L>
<L>But one blank vizor blot out all the face.</L>
<L>O! glorious times, when actors thus could &s;trike</L>
<L>Expre&s;&s;ive, inexpre&s;&s;ive, all alike!</L>
<L>Le&s;s change of face, than in our Punch they &s;aw,</L>
<L>For Punch can roll his eyes, and wag his jaw;</L>
<L>With one &s;et glare they mouth'd the rumbling ver&s;e,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> look not half &s;o fierce!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="5">
<L>Yet tho' depriv'd of in&s;truments like the&s;e,</L>
<L>Nature, perhaps, may find a way to plea&s;e;</L>
<L>Which, where&s;oe'er &s;he glows with genuine flame,</L>
<L>In <HI>Greece,</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> is the &s;ame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of raillery then, ye modern wits beware,</L>
<L>Nor damn the Grecian poet, for the player.</L>
<L>Theirs was the &s;kill, with hone&s;t help of art,</L>
<L>To win by ju&s;t degrees, the yielding heart.</L>
<L>What if our Shake&s;pear claims the magic throne,</L>
<L>And in one in&s;tant makes us all his own,</L>
<L>They differ only, in the point of view,</L>
<L>For Shake&s;pear's nature, was their nature too.</L>
