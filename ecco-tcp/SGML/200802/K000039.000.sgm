<HEAD>To the Right Honourable ARTHUR Lord <HI>ALTHAM,</HI> BARON of <HI>ALTHAM,</HI> In the Kingdom of IRELAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>POetry,</HI> in its fir&s;t In&s;titution, was prin|cipally de&s;ign'd to Correct, and rectify Manners. Thence it was that the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Athenian Stages</HI> were accounted Schools of Divinity and Mora|lity; where the Tragick Writers of tho&s;e Days in&s;pired their Audiences with <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Heroick Sentiments,</HI> and the <HI>Comick</HI> laugh'd and diverted them out of their <HI>Vices;</HI> and by rediculing <HI>Folly, Intemperence,</HI> and <HI>De|bauchery,</HI>
<PB REF="4">
gave them an Indignation for tho&s;e Irregularities, and made them pur&s;ue the oppo&s;ite <HI>Virtues.</HI></P>
<P>This caus'd the <HI>Dramatic Poets,</HI> in anci|ent Times, not only to be reverenc'd by the lower &s;ort of People, but highly E&s;teem'd and Courted by Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank; and tho' the Writers of latter Ages, have, in a greater Mea&s;ure, not to &s;ay in a &s;candelous Manner, deviated from the Foot-&s;teps, and Examples of their Pre|dece&s;&s;ors; yet have they found Protection and Favour with tho&s;e, who have been &s;o Generous as to a&s;cribe the Faults of the <HI>Po|ets</HI> to the Degeneracy of the <HI>Age</HI> wherein they liv'd.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration, <HI>my Lord,</HI> has im|bolden'd me to this Addre&s;s, for tho' on the one Hand I am &s;en&s;ible, that the fol|lowing Piece does little Merit your <HI>Lord|&s;hip</HI>'s Patronage; yet your innate Goodne&s;s and Genero&s;ity give me hopes, that your Lord&s;hip will Pardon this Intru&s;ion, in
<PB REF="5">
which I have the Examples of all tho&s;e that <HI>wrote</HI> before me to bear me out. I heartily wi&s;h this Play were more worthy of your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Acceptance: Yet &s;o much, I hope, will be forgiven to the fondne&s;s of a Mother for her Production; if, I &s;ay, in its Favour, that through the whole Piece, I have had a tender regard to good Manners, and by the main Drift of it, endeavour'd to Redicule and Correct one of the mo&s;t reigning Vices of the Age. I might &s;ay, as many of my <HI>Brethren</HI> have done upon &s;lighter Grounds, that this Play has had the good Fortune to Plea&s;e and Di|vert the Nice&s;t, and Polite&s;t Part of the Town; but I &s;hould &s;et little Stre&s;s on their Applau&s;e, had I not &s;ome rea&s;on to de|pend upon your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Approbation, who&s;e Judgement, Penetration and Di&s;|cernment, are alone &s;ufficient to do full Ju&s;tice to a performance of this Kind.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
And now, my <HI>Lord,</HI> if I follow'd the beaten Road of Dedicators, it would natu|rally Engage me in a <HI>Panegirick,</HI> upon your Lord&s;hip's Per&s;onal Virtues, and tho&s;e of your <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Pious Family;</HI> but I &s;hall purpo&s;ely decline a Talk to which I freely own my Ability is Unequal, and which, tho' manag'd by a <HI>Ma&s;terly Pen,</HI> would make your Mode&s;ty &s;uffer. There|fore I &s;hall conclude, with begging your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s leave to Sub&s;cribe my &s;elf, with all imaginable Re&s;pect and Sincerity.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE</HEAD>
<STAGE>Spoke by Mr. <HI>Penkethman.</HI></STAGE>
<L>IN all the Faces that to Plays Re&s;ort,</L>
<L>Whether of Country, City, Mob or Court;</L>
<L>I've always found that none &s;uch hopes In&s;pire,</L>
<L>As you&mdash;dear Brethren of the Upper Tire.</L>
<L>Poets in Prologues, may both Preach and Rail,</L>
<L>Yet all their Wi&s;dom, nothing will avail,</L>
<L>Who writes not up to you, 'tis ten to one will fail.</L>
<L>Your thundring plaudit 'tis that deals out Fame,</L>
<L>You make Plays run, tho' of them&s;elves but Lame:</L>
<L>How often have we known your Noi&s;e Commanding,</L>
<L>Impo&s;e on your Inferior Ma&s;ters Under&s;tanding;</L>
<L>Therefore, Dear Brethren, (&s;ince I am one of you)</L>
<L>Whether adorn'd in Grey, Green, Brown or Blue,</L>
<L>This day &s;tand all by me, as I will fall by you,</L>
<L>And now to let&mdash;</L>
<L>The poor Pit &s;ee how Pinky's Voice Commands,</L>
<L>Silence&mdash;Now rattle all your Sticks, and clap your grimy Hands&punc;</L>
<L>I greet your Love&mdash;and let the vaine&s;t Author &s;how,</L>
<L>Half this Command on clearer Hands below,</L>
<L>Nay, more to prove your Intere&s;t, let this Play live by you.</L>
<L>So may you &s;hare good Claret with your Ma&s;ters,</L>
<L>Still free in your Amours from their Di&s;a&s;ters;</L>
<L>Free from poor Hou&s;e-keeping, where Peck is under Locks&punc;</L>
<L>Free from Cold Kitchings, and no Chri&s;tmas Box:</L>
<L>So may no long Debates i'th' Hou&s;e of Commons,</L>
<L>Make you in the Lobby Starve, when hungar Summons:</L>
<L>But may your plentious Vails come flowing in,</L>
<L>Give you a lucky hit, and make you Gentlemen;</L>
<L>And thus preferr'd, ne'er fear the World's Reproaches,</L>
<L>But &s;hake your Elbows with my Lord, and keep your Coaches:</L>

<L>THis goodly Fabrick to a gazing Tarr,</L>

<L>Aloft! that Swabber's Ne&s;t, that's the Main-Top.</L>
<L>Side-boxes mann'd with Beau, and modi&s;h Rake,</L>
<L>Are like the Fore-ca&s;tle, and Quarter-Deck.</L>
<L>Tho&s;e dark di&s;gui&s;ed, advent'rous, black-nos'd few,</L>
<L>May pa&s;s for Gunners, or a Fire-&s;hip's Crew.</L>
<L>Some come like Privateers a Prize to &s;eize,</L>
<L>And catch the <HI>French</HI> within the Narrow Seas.</L>
<L>The Orange-Ladies, Virgins of Renown,</L>
<L>Are Powder-Monkies running up and down.</L>
<L>We've here our Calms, our Storms, and pro&s;p'rous Gales,</L>
<L>And &s;hift our Scenes as Seamen &s;hift their Sails.</L>
<L>The Ship's well mann'd, and not ill Woman'd neither,</L>
<L>So Balla&s;t'd and Stow'd, my Lads, &s;he'll bear the Weather.</L>
<L>But greater Dangers ventring Players alarm,</L>
<L>This Night's Engagement's wor&s;e than any Storm.</L>
<L>The Poet's Captain, but half dead with fright,</L>
<L>She leaves her Officers to maintain the Fight;</L>
<L>Yon'd middle Teer with Eighteen Pounders mauls us,</L>
<L>That Upper-Deck with Great and Small-Shot gauls us.</L>
<L>But from this Lower-Teer mo&s;t Harm befals,</L>
<L>There's no oppo&s;ing their prevailing Balls.</L>
<L>As either Foe or Friend their Chain-&s;hot flies,</L>
<L>We &s;ink or &s;wim, we Conquer, Fall or Ri&s;e.</L>
<L>To fit and rig our Ships much Pains we take;</L>
<L>Grant we may now a Saving-Voyage make.</L>
<L>Here we're Embark'd, and as you Smile or Frown,</L>
<L>You are our Stars, by You we Live or Drown.</L>
