<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE art of preface-writing is, perhaps, the art of concealing the anxiety of an author. There are &s;ome works which require nor preface nor anxiety: the pre&s;ent trifle merits neither; yet I cannot refrain from be&s;towing on it a little of both.</P>
<P>A Di&s;&s;ertation demands (and I confe&s;s it) a certain &s;y&s;tematical regularity, which is above me. But a Di&s;&s;ertation on Anecdotes is a thing &s;o eccentric, that if, on the whole,
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
my pages are not found to weary the reader, it is ju&s;t that he &s;hould have the candour not to complain, if it does not preci&s;ely an&s;wer the idea he may form of a Di&s;&s;ertation.</P>
<P>I am even de&s;irous, that this E&s;&s;ay may not be con&s;idered as de&s;titute of connection, becau&s;e at the fir&s;t glance it may thus ap|pear. The work con&s;i&s;ts not of a mere ma&s;s of loo&s;e anecdotes; the&s;e are given as &s;ketches of the manner in which various to|pics may be conducted; and elucidate tho&s;e reflections on the nature of anecdotes, which, if they &s;hall be found to be pertinent, is all of which I am &s;olicitous. In my notes, I have taken a greater freedom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; but this has been (to u&s;e the language of a ma&s;ter in literary compo&s;ition) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'with the hone&s;t de&s;ire of giving u&s;eful plea&s;ure.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4">
There is a &s;ingularity re&s;pecting the word <HI>Anecdote,</HI> which it is not here improper to notice. Anecdotes is an appellation given by &s;cholars to M&s;&s;. which they di&s;covered in libraries, and afterwards publi&s;hed. This term is &s;trictly according to its Grecian de|rivation, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, i. e. things not yet pub|li&s;hed. Thus Cicero, as Moreri ob&s;erves, gave the name of Anecdote to a work which he had not yet publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>We have borrowed the u&s;e of this word, in its ordinary &s;ignification, from the French, who employ it for any intere&s;ting circum|&s;tance. In this &s;en&s;e Varillas publi&s;hed Anecdotes of the family of the Medicis.</P>
<P>John&s;on has imperfectly defined the word, by &s;aying, that, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It is now u&s;ed after the
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
French for a <HI>biographical incident;</HI> a mi|nute pa&s;&s;age of <HI>private life.</HI>'</Q> This con|fines its &s;ignification merely to <HI>biography;</HI> but anecdotes are &s;u&s;ceptible of a more en|larged application. This word is more ju&s;tly defined in the Cyclopaedia, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'a term which (now) denotes a relation of detached and intere&s;ting particulars.'</Q> We give <HI>anec|dotes</HI> of the art as well as the Arti&s;t; of the war as well as the General; of the nation as well as of the Monarch.</P>
<P>I conclude by ob&s;erving, that if a &s;eries of anecdotes &s;hall be found capable of il|lu&s;trating any individual topic, we yet want a collection of &s;uch anecdotes. A writer for this purpo&s;e &s;hould unite to the ardour of re&s;earch, a &s;olid judgment and a correct ta&s;te. Yet, with all the&s;e qualifications, I
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
am fearful that the world would be more inclined to commend his indu&s;try, than di&s;tingui&s;h his talents. It is, therefore, not probable, that a man of genius will conde|&s;cend to arrange anecdotes; and we mu&s;t lament, that the fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperficial minds deters the ingenious &s;tudent from giving the world literary &s;peculations, the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, and the mo&s;t delightful.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON ANECDOTES.</HEAD>
<P>A Writer of periodical critici&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Briti&s;h Critic for July 1793, p. 324.</NOTE>, has given &s;ome ob&s;ervations on ANEC|DOTES; which, becau&s;e they echo the voice of &s;everal men of letters, it may not be im|proper to inve&s;tigate. The opinions of our critic, to me, appear erroneous, becau&s;e they regard anecdotes as only agreeable objects of literary amu&s;ement. A writer &s;hould correct others, or correct him&s;elf: I there|fore hazard this e&s;&s;ay. A dry di&s;&s;ertation on anecdotes appears thorny; let us try if we cannot di&s;cover blo&s;&s;oms and flowers.</P>
<P>The critic &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Anecdotes are among the luxuries of literature;'</Q> and he is <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'fear|ful that the mind &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to them, and reject &s;everer diet.'</Q> I rejoice,
<PB N="2" REF="8">
however, to be informed, in the &s;ame para|graph, that, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'they &s;timulate the appetite for reading, and create it where deficient.'</Q> This logic is not in the happie&s;t manner of Bayle.</P>
<P>I will not deny that anecdotes are to be placed among literary luxuries. The refine|ment of a nation influences the genius of its literature; we now require not only a &s;o|lid repa&s;t, but a delicious de&s;&s;ert. A phy|&s;ician, au&s;tere as Hippocrates, a critic, rigid as Ari&s;totle, are alike inimical to our refre&s;h|ments. We will not be fooled into their &s;y&s;tems. We do not di&s;mi&s;s our fruits and and our wines from our tables; we eat, and our health remains unprejudiced. We read anecdotes with voluptuous delight; nor is our &s;cience impaired, or our wit rendered le&s;s brilliant.</P>
<P>The day has pa&s;t, when per&s;evering dull|ne&s;s obtained the honours of literary emi|nence. A vigorous memory was then the only talent required in the &s;cholar; he was the greate&s;t genius who read mo&s;t. Our age does not think highly of tho&s;e names, once &s;o celebrated. Learning, in its pre|&s;ent diffu&s;ion, will only plea&s;e as it is found|ed
<PB N="3" REF="9">
on a &s;olid judgment, and embelli&s;hed by the graces of a fine ta&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this &s;ubject Scaliger has made a judicious ob&s;erva|tion. He &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'If a per&s;on's <HI>learning</HI> is to be judged of by his <HI>reading,</HI> nobody can deny Eu&s;ebius the character of a learned man; but if he is to be e&s;teemed learned, who has &s;hewn <HI>judgment</HI> together with his <HI>reading,</HI> Eu&s;ebius is not &s;uch.'</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is therefore not ju&s;t to con&s;ider anec|dotes merely as a &s;ource of entertainment, becau&s;e they amu&s;e; if it &s;hall be &s;ound that they &s;erve al&s;o for the purpo&s;es of utility, they will de&s;erve to be cla&s;&s;ed higher in the &s;cale of &s;tudy than hitherto they have been.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdotes &s;eldom read with reflec|tion.</NOTE> All the world read anecdotes; but not many with reflection, and &s;till fewer with ta&s;te. To mo&s;t, one anecdote re&s;embles another; a little unconnected &s;tory that is heard, that plea&s;es, and is forgotten. Yet when anecdotes are not merely tran&s;crib|ed, but animated by judicious reflections, they recal others of a kindred nature: one &s;ugge&s;ts another; and the whole &s;eries is made to illu&s;trate &s;ome topic that gratifies curio&s;ity, or impre&s;&s;es on the mind &s;ome in|tere&s;ting conclu&s;ion in the affairs of human life. Like the concord of notes, one de|pends on the other, and the whole forms a perfect harmony.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10">
We will take a review of &s;ome of tho&s;e effects, which anecdotes appear capable of producing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo&s;t agreeable parts of Hi&s;tory, con&s;i&s;t in it's anec|dotes.</NOTE> Hi&s;tory it&s;elf derives &s;ome of it's mo&s;t agreeable in&s;tructions from a &s;kilful intro|duction of anecdotes. We &s;hould not now dwell with anxiety on a dull chronicle of the reigns of monarchs; a pari&s;h regi&s;ter might prove more intere&s;ting. We are not now &s;olicitous of attending to battles, which have cea&s;ed to alarm; to &s;ieges, which can de&s;troy none of our towns; and to &s;torms, which can never bur&s;t upon our &s;hores. We turn with di&s;gu&s;t from fic|tions told without the grace of fable, and from truths unintere&s;ting as fables told with|out grace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Romancers have exi&s;ted in all nations, under the names of hi&s;torians, from the notorious Geffrey of Monmouth, to Jean le Maire, who in his Illu&s;trations of Gaul, makes the French nation de&s;cend from the fugitive princes of Troy. This is not quite &s;o marvellous, as the eccentric follies of &s;everal <HI>modern</HI> Iri&s;h antiquaries. Col. V..... has pu&s;hed his national re&s;earches as far back as the time of the deluge. Since he was &s;o employed he might have gone further; for an old writer has even favoured us with the names of the <HI>&s;even Iri&s;h Kings</HI> who flouri&s;hed <HI>before Noah!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. T. Warton, in his ob&s;ervations on the Fa&euml;ry Queen, notices one of Geffrey's fables. This monk, in his account of the original &s;tate of Albion has the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">'Erat tunc nomen in&s;ulae Albion quae a nemine ni&s;i a <HI>paucis gigantibus</HI> inhabitabatur.'</Q> A <HI>few giants,</HI> in that hi&s;torian's opinion, were but of little con&s;ideration.</P></NOTE> Our hearts have learnt to &s;ym|pathi&s;e; and we con&s;ult the annals of hi&s;tory,
<PB N="5" REF="11">
as a &s;on and a brother would turn over his dome&s;tic memoirs. We read hi&s;tory, not to indulge the frivolous inqui&s;itivene&s;s of a dull antiquary, but to explore into the cau&s;es of the mi&s;eries and the pro&s;perities of our country. We are more intere&s;ted in the progre&s;s of the human mind, than in that of empires.</P>
<P>A Hearne would feel a frigid rapture, if he could di&s;cover the name of a Saxon mo|narch unrecorded in our annals; and of whom as little &s;hould remain, as of the doubt|ful bones of a Saxon dug out of a tumulus. Such are his anecdotes!&mdash;A Hume is only intere&s;ted with tho&s;e characters, who have exerted them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of huma|nity, and with tho&s;e incidents, which have &s;ubverted or e&s;tabli&s;hed the felicities of a people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There will always be antiquaries, who will &s;olace them&s;elves with the hope, that dull indu&s;try will compen&s;ate for a total want of the energy of genius. Such will not di&s;cern when minute enquiry dwindles into frivolous inutility. The elegance and the reflection of Hume, are regarded with con|tempt by the&s;e unenlightened &s;tudents; and they condemn the philo&s;opher, preci&s;ely for what he is mo&s;t to be commended; for not wa&s;ting his pages on re&s;earches, that re&s;emble con|jectures, into our Saxon annals, which, if they could be known with accuracy, would not be more intere&s;ting than the annals of the Aby&s;&s;inians, over which many a reader of ta&s;te has groaned in the bulky volumes of Mr. Bruce. But on the &s;ubject of &s;uch remote antiquities, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a conver&s;ation recorded by Mr. Bo&s;wel, apologizing for quoting a book which is in the hands of every one. On our anti|quarian re&s;earches, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'All that is really <HI>known</HI> of the ancient &s;tate of Britain, is contained in a <HI>few pages.</HI> We can know no more than what the old writers have told us; yet what large books have we upon it, the whole of which, excepting &s;uch parts as are taken from tho&s;e old writers, is all a dream, &s;uch as Whitaker's Manche&s;ter.&mdash;I have heard Henry's hi&s;tory of Great Britain well &s;poken of; I am told it is carried on in &s;eparate divi&s;ions, as the civil, the military, the religious hi&s;tory; I wi&s;h much to have one branch well done, and that is <HI>the hi&s;tory of manners,</HI> of com|mon life.'</Q> Robert&s;on an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Henry &s;hould have ap|plied his attention to that <HI>alone,</HI> which is enough for any man.'</Q> Vol. iii. p. 122.</NOTE>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anecdotes &s;erve as ma|terials for the hi&s;tory of manners.</NOTE> Hence the hi&s;tory of manners has become the prime object of the re&s;earches of philo|&s;ophers. How is this prominent feature in hi&s;tory to be depicted? The arti&s;t mu&s;t not here draw at fancy, a beautiful or fanta&s;tical line. He mu&s;t regard his object with mi|nute attention, and he mu&s;t reflect long on a thou&s;and little &s;trokes, which are to give the faithful re&s;emblance. The hi&s;torian mu&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="13">
a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly arrange the minute anecdotes of the age he examines; he mu&s;t oftener have recour&s;e to the diaries of individuals, than to the archives of a nation. Nothing, how|ever minute, mu&s;t e&s;cape his re&s;earch, though every thing is not to be reported<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that our antiquarian &s;tudies begin to rank high in the mind of the philo&s;opher. They &s;eem to be directed to the illu&s;tration, not merely of obliterated in|&s;criptions, but of ancient manners. The &s;epulchral monu|ments of Mr. Gough, form a &s;plendid work of this kind, which has de&s;ervedly gained their author the di&s;tingui&s;hed title of the Engli&s;h Montfaucon. We may ob&s;erve of what importance, in this intere&s;ting topic, are the memorandums of an individual, from the recovery of the book of the Ma&s;ter of the Revels, which Mr. Malone has been &s;o fortunate as to obtain. We enter more fully into the genius of tho&s;e times, from &s;uch publications, than from the &s;uperficial ac|counts and fanciful conjectures of any modern writer. He who would penetrate further into the&s;e amu&s;ing re&s;earches, mu&s;t apply him&s;elf to a clo&s;e examination of tho&s;e 200 4to volumes of old plays which Mr. Garrick has depo&s;ited in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum; to a patient peru&s;al of innumerable M&s;&s;; and to the collecting matter from the printed books of the times. The pro&s;pect looks boundle&s;s and dreary; it ap|pears at a di&s;tance a dark fore&s;t; yet when once explored with ardour, it wants not occa&s;ional &s;un&s;hine to cheer us and vernal banks to repo&s;e on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Various anecdotes illu&s;trating the hi&s;tory of manners.</NOTE> To inform the world, that in the xvith Century, bi&s;hops only were permitted the u&s;e of &s;ilk; that princes and prince&s;&s;es only had the prerogative of wearing &s;carlet clothes either of &s;ilk or of wool; and that only
<PB N="8" REF="14">
princes and bi&s;hops had a right to wear &s;hoes made of &s;ilk;&mdash;&s;uch anecdotes would appear trivial in the hands of a mere anti|quary; but they become important when touched by a philo&s;ophical hi&s;torian. The&s;e little particulars awaken, in the mind of Voltaire, an admirable reflection: he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"All the&s;e &s;umptuary laws only &s;hew, that the government of the&s;e times had not al|ways great objects in their view; and that it appeared ea&s;ier for mini&s;ters to pro&s;cribe, than to encourage indu&s;try."</Q></P>
<P>Had I to &s;ketch the &s;ituation of the Jews in the ninth century, and to exhibit at the &s;ame time the character of that age of bigotry, could I do it more effectually than by the following anecdote, which a learned friend (who will one day be celebrated for his hi&s;torical re&s;earches) di&s;covered in &s;ome manu&s;cript records?</P>
<P>A jew, of Rouen in Normandy, &s;ells a hou&s;e to a chri&s;tian inhabitant of that city. After &s;ome time of re&s;idence, a &s;torm happens, lightning falls on the hou&s;e, and does con&s;iderable damage. The chri&s;|tian, unenlightened, villainous, and pious, cites the trembling de&s;cendant of I&s;rael into
<PB N="9" REF="15">
court for <HI>damages.</HI> His eloquent coun&s;ellor hurls an admirable philippic again&s;t this de|te&s;table nation of heretics, and concludes by proving, that it was owing to this hou&s;e hav|ing been the interdicted property of an I&s;raelite, that a thunderbolt fell upon the roof. The judges (as it may be &s;uppo&s;ed) were not long in terminating this &s;uit. They decreed that God had damaged this hou&s;e as a mark of his vengeance again&s;t the property of a jew, and that therefore it was ju&s;t the repairs &s;hould be at his co&s;t.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is to be acknowledged, that the judges were merciful, and the jew for|tunate. To be condemned to rebuild a hou&s;e, is better than to be burnt with &s;ome of it's old wood.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add one more in&s;tance which may prove, that it is alone by anecdotes the genius of an age or nation is thoroughly to be un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>The French nation, before their &s;ingular revolution, di&s;played a &s;plendid &s;cene of re|finement, of luxury, and of frivolity, which perhaps was never yet pre&s;ented to the eye of the philo&s;opher, on this theatre of the world. In reading the &s;ecret memoirs of
<PB N="10" REF="16">
that country (a &s;candalous chronicle, which was carried on for above thirty years) one gathers many curious particulars, which can only be found in the&s;e fugitive leaves. Re|ligion was forbidden them by the philo&s;o|phers, and politics by the government. They exhau&s;ted their active and volatile genius, on the objects of ta&s;te; ta&s;te, that they contrived &s;hould be the image of both, for it had it's here&s;ies, and it's parties. The theatre, and the book&s;eller's &s;hop, formed the great concerns of the Pari&s;ian. Voltaire was more to be dreaded, than the prime mini&s;ter; and Mad. Clairon (their celebrated actre&s;s) appears to have enjoyed the &s;overeignty of Paris.</P>
<P>Sometimes we ob&s;erve, that a publication ferments the town for a week; the mini&s;ter &s;ends the author to the Ba&s;tille for a month: the book is publicly burnt, forbidden to be &s;old, and every body has it by heart. The police &s;ometimes is &s;o rigid as to put an em|bargo on all M&s;&s;.; to impri&s;on cen&s;ors of books becau&s;e they &s;uffered pa&s;&s;ages to be printed which appear to the court of an of|fen&s;ive nature; in a word, &s;everal printers are compelled to &s;ell their founts, and a di&s;|mal
<PB N="11" REF="17">
barrenne&s;s appears in the literature of France.</P>
<P>Sometimes we perceive theatrical repre|&s;entations to be the objects of mini&s;terial vengeance. They forbid a particular play, who&s;e &s;ubject might be applicable to the moment; or even a particular pa&s;&s;age of a play, which the malicious actor pronounced with empha&s;is. I give an in&s;tance of the latter, in the note underneath.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On the 19th February, 1762, in playing Tancred, Mad. Clairon, when &s;he came to the&s;e ver&s;es, 
<Q><L>'On depouille Tancrede, on l'exile, on l'outrage,&mdash;</L>
<L>'C'e&s;t le &s;ort d'un Heros d'etre per&s;ecut&eacute;&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tout &s;on parti &s;e tait; qui &s;era &s;on appui?</L>
<L>'Sa gloire&mdash;</L>
<L>'Un Heros qu'on opprime attendrit tous les coeurs&mdash;'</L></Q> 
This &s;ublime actre&s;s made &s;uch inflexions of her voice, &s;o noble and &s;o penetrating, that all the audience recollected the event of that day, which was a lettre de cachet the Marquis de Broglio had received. His name flew from mouth to mouth (&s;ays my reporter) and the repre&s;entation was frequently interrupted by the loud applau&s;es which were continually renewed.</P>
<P>The next day the hou&s;e was forbidden to act the tragedy of Tancred, in con&s;equence of what had pa&s;&s;ed on the preced|ing repre&s;entation.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>But it is not my intention to fill up an elaborate picture of the French nation at the&s;e moments; that probably will &s;oon oc|cupy
<PB N="12" REF="18">
the contemplation of men of able ta|lents.</P>
<P>But I would give one &s;triking example of the national character at this period; and for this purpo&s;e I employ the following anecdotes.</P>
<P>Mol&eacute;, a favourite actor, falls ill, and is confined to his chamber; when this is an|nounced from the &s;tage, the gaiety of Paris &s;uddenly lours with gloom. The next day his door is be&s;ieged by enquiring crouds; his health is the conver&s;ation of all compa|nies. It appeared as if Scipio lay confined, and the virtuous Romans pa&s;&s;ed their hours in melancholy anxiety, for the life of their protector. The phy&s;icians find Mol&eacute; in an exhau&s;ted &s;tate, and pre&s;cribe a free u&s;e of wine. This pre&s;cription is &s;oon known in the circles at Paris; and Mol&eacute; finds two thou&s;and bottles of the fine&s;t Burgundy &s;ent to his hou&s;e from various quarters. Mol&eacute; at length recovers; all Paris rejoices, and ru&s;hes to his benefit. Such was the public ardour, that it produced him the amazing &s;um of 24,000 livres. Mol&eacute; gratefully re|ceives the valuable tribute of their applau&s;e; he was in debt, and the benefit formed all
<PB N="13" REF="19">
his fortune. How then does Mol&eacute; apply his 24,000 livres? An Engli&s;hman would have purcha&s;ed an annuity, or perhaps have paid his debts. Mol&eacute; runs to the jeweller, takes its amount in brilliants, and gives them to his mi&s;tre&s;s, who boa&s;ts that &s;he wears all the honours of the public.</P>
<P>This &s;erves to di&s;play at once the frivolity of the nation, and of the individual. All Paris is concerned for the indi&s;po&s;ition of an actor, and all terminates in giving dia|monds to an impudent brunette.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;tories compared with me|moirs.</NOTE> Of the eminent per&s;onages in hi&s;tory, we have many differing characters. We know well how the object will appear when &s;een through the coloured tele&s;cope of a pre|judiced hi&s;torian. The mo&s;t impartial may not always be &s;ucce&s;sful in his delineations. An intelligent reader frequently di&s;covers <HI>traits</HI> which &s;eem concealed. He does not perceive the&s;e faint touches in the broad canva&s;s of the hi&s;torian, but in tho&s;e little portraits which have &s;ometimes reached po&s;terity. He acquires more knowledge of indiviuals by memoirs, than by hi&s;tories. In hi&s;tories there is a maje&s;ty, which keeps us di&s;tant from great men; in memoirs,
<PB N="14" REF="20">
there is a familiarity, which invites us to approach them. In hi&s;tories, we appear only as one who joins the croud to &s;ee them pa&s;s; in memoirs, we are like concealed &s;pies, who pau&s;e on every little circum|&s;tance, and note every little expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is thus that &s;uch works as Plutarch's Lives, Froi&s;&s;art's Chronicle, the Memoirs of Comines and Brantome, Burnet's and Clarendon's Hi&s;tories of their own Times, have ever allured curio&s;ity, and gratified in|quiry. There are indeed readers who, when they turn over the pages of hi&s;tory, indulge in the marvellous of romance. A vi&s;ionary perfection darts from their imagi|nation, and throws around a brilliant delu|&s;ion. Their heroes are, prince Arthurs; their Heroines, Unas; their State&s;men, Merlins. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in the mode in which hi&s;tory is frequently com|po&s;ed, there are &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to render &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem plau&s;ible. One can hardly meet with the mo&s;t natural event in the hi&s;tories of &s;uch writers as Tacitus, of Strada, and of Mariana, but the&s;e refined writers are for deriving it from &s;ome pro|found policy, or intricate deception.

<P>Louis XIV. merits the love of po&s;terity.
<PB N="20" REF="26">
The genuis of his people, not his own, in|&s;pired him with attempts inimical to the rights of mankind. When this monarch is deprived of that fal&s;e glory which his adula|tors have thrown around him, he will ap|pear to advantage, placed in the &s;ofter light of tho&s;e hours, which he devoted to the &s;ociety of the great men whom his &s;plendid patronage had formed. Numerous anecdotes of this monarch, are eternal te&s;timonies of his intellectual powers and his fine ta&s;te. He loved the conver&s;ations of Boileau and Racine. He was not a mere auditor of their works; he admired them with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and animadverted on them with ju&s;t criti|ci&s;m. We know that he detected &s;everal errors in their works. The eye that could catch a Boileau and a Racine tripping, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed was of no ordinary quick|ne&s;s. Several of the&s;e royal conver&s;ations have been recorded. It is honourable for the &s;atyrical bard, that he had the boldne&s;s frequently to &s;peak his &s;entiments freely; and what is &s;till more honourable, his maje&s;ty did not di&s;like his frankne&s;s. I give the reader one or two of tho&s;e intere&s;ting anecdotes, which relate to the&s;e two poets.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27">
It is well known, that when Boileau read to his Maje&s;ty one of his epi&s;tles, in which are the&s;e fine ver&s;es, de&s;cribing the Empe|ror Titus, 
<Q><L>'Qui rendit de &s;on joug l'univers amoureux;</L>

<L>'N'avoit par &s;es bienfaits &s;ignal&eacute; la journ&eacute;e'&mdash;</L></Q> 
his Maje&s;ty was enchanted, and made the poet repeat them thrice. At that mo|ment, perhaps, he propo&s;ed Titus for his model; &s;uch was the force of poetry! The next day, he gave orders for the war; &s;uch was the power of politics! When the &s;a|tiric bard, for the fir&s;t time after the death of Racine, paid his re&s;pects to the king, Louis received him with affection. He &s;ympathi&s;ed in the lo&s;s; and he added, in pulling out his watch, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Remember, Boi|leau, I have an hour for you every week.'</Q></P>
<P>I add one more anecdote, which brings us into his apartment. When the French Augu&s;tus was one day confined to his cham|ber, he &s;ent for Racine. The poet read with grace; and his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked him to take up &s;ome book. A life of Plutarch was pro|po&s;ed.

This anecdote, with others which might be given, and the whole of the eloquent Eikon Ba&s;ilike, &s;trongly indicate, that the inclinations of Charles were remote from tyranny. He was, indeed, firmly per&s;uaded, that a king had ju&s;t powers, of which it was as nece&s;&s;ary to be careful, as of the ju&s;t rights of his people. Such was his conviction, that he preferred death, to what he con&s;i|dered to be ignominy.</P>
<P>I conclude this topic with an anecdote of the late unfortunate Louis XVI. little known, but which forcibly characterizes the di&s;po&s;itions of this monarch.

Of &s;ome extraordinary minds it has been &s;aid, that their knowledge is attained by that &s;ublime conception, which &s;urveys at one glance the &s;pecies, and becomes as it were by intuition, familiar with the individual.

Would he inform us, that innumerable little follies prevail in very great minds? Every opinion is di&s;putable.

A &s;imilar character was this of Po&s;tel. His Lectures were attended by &s;uch crouds, that he was obliged to harangue his auditors at a window, as the hall of the college at Paris was not &s;ufficiently large to contain them; yet this man, (otherwi&s;e &s;o judicious) cheri&s;hed the extravagant folly of believing him&s;elf endowed with a &s;uper|natural rea&s;on.

<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve the fir&s;t dawn of genius breaking on the mind. Sometimes a man of genius, in his fir&s;t effu&s;ions, is &s;o far from revealing his future powers, that, on the contrary, no rea&s;onable hope can be formed of his &s;ucce&s;s. In the violent &s;truggle of his mind, he may give a wrong direction to his talents; as Swift, in two pindaric odes, which have been unfortunately pre&s;erved in his works. Sometimes a man of genius di&s;plays no talents, even among tho&s;e who are able to decide on them; his genius, like Aeneas, is veiled by a cloud, and remains unperceived by his a&s;&s;ociates. This was the ca&s;e of Gold&s;mith; who was &s;o far from di&s;playing a fine genius, that even his literary companions, before the publication of his beautiful poems, regarded
<PB N="33" REF="39">
him as a compiler for the Book&s;ellers, not as a writer for men of ta&s;te. Sometimes, when a writer di&s;plays an early genuis, it is not expre&s;&s;ed with all its force. Several have began ver&s;ifiers, and concluded poets; and perhaps this is no unju&s;t idea of Pope.</P>
<P>Is a man of genius oppre&s;&s;ed with do|me&s;tic mi&s;eries? Does he tread on thorns, while he cultivates flowers? he cea&s;es to feel his own griefs, while he contemplates tho&s;e of his ma&s;ters. On the misfortunes of the learned, more than one volume has been compo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pierius Valerianus, has given a little book, intitled, <HI>De infelicitate litteratorum,</HI> which he wrote from his own &s;itu|ation, in which for many years he participated in the mi&s;eries he recorded of other &s;cholars.

I ha&s;ten to conclude a li&s;t, which perhaps is interminable. Can we read without indignation, that the family of the great De&s;cartes were in&s;en&s;ible to the lu&s;tre his &s;tudies reflected on their name? They grievou&s;ly lamented, as a blot, which could not be effaced from their arms, that De&s;|cartes, who was born a <HI>gentleman,</HI> &s;hould become a <HI>philo&s;opher!</HI> This elevated genius was even denied the &s;atisfaction of em|bracing his expiring parent; while his dwarfi&s;h brother, who&s;e mind mu&s;t have been as diminutive as his per&s;on, ridiculed his philo&s;ophic relative, and turned to ad|vantage his philo&s;ophic di&s;po&s;itions.

<P>It has been &s;aid, that Envy is only the offspring of little minds. This has been repeated from age to age; but it is one of tho&s;e popular prejudices which are not the le&s;s fal&s;e, becau&s;e they are of a remote date. Of literary jealou&s;y, to &s;elect in&s;tances were difficult, becau&s;e of their abundance. Why did Swift and Milton treat with con|tempt the rhimes of Dryden? Why did Corneille, tottering on the grave, when Racine con&s;ulted him on his fir&s;t tragedy, advi&s;e the author never to write another? Why does Voltaire continually detract from the &s;ublimity of Corneille, the &s;weetne&s;s of Racine, and the fire of Crebillon? Why was the admirable La Fontaine not even mentioned by the French Horace in all his works? Why mu&s;t po&s;terity lament that the name of Young is to be found in the Dunciad of Pope? Why did Boccaccio, in &s;ending to Petrarch a copy of Dante, make an apology for it? and why did the latter, in his an&s;wer, &s;peak coldly of Dante's merits?

The rigid virtue of John&s;on could not &s;ave him from the meane&s;t envy of Garrick; nor the artle&s;s di&s;po&s;itions of Gold&s;mith from the corro&s;ion of literary jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>It is difficult to repre&s;s our indignation at this envy of writers, who &s;hould look for that &s;upport from each other, which is &s;ometimes unju&s;tly denied them by the world. In contemplating on this &s;ubject, we are &s;truck with the &s;ame horror as if we were to look into a ne&s;t of doves, and behold vipers hi&s;&s;ing at each other.</P>

<P>Of Seneca, it is ob&s;erved in the Perro|niana, that he him&s;elf writes again&s;t pointed periods, and the epigrammatic &s;tyle.

which the Greeks were accu&s;tomed to &s;cat|ter their adver&s;aries; and who frequently pa&s;&s;ed from the cen&s;ure of the work, to &s;a|tirizing the author him&s;elf.

<P>We are a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;olemn appeals which our Bi&s;hop makes to Heaven, for the veracity of his facts. I &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t readers imagine that he mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible that he was only calling on Heaven to &s;erve as a te&s;timony to &s;anction lies. This, however, (to do as much ju&s;tice as po&s;&s;ible to the Bi&s;hop) does not appear to me to be the ca&s;e. Burnet has been called the Engli&s;h Varillas; and the character of the latter writer, attacked by the learned of all nations, and particularly in this country by the ingenious Dr. King, may &s;erve to illu&s;trate that of Burnet.</P>
<P>Varillas has been accu&s;ed of quoting memoirs which never exi&s;ted, or in which the facts he relates are not to be found. It is however very true that Varillas had read an a&s;toni&s;hing number of original memoirs. The life of this man was con&s;umed in his &s;tudy; and it was his boa&s;t, that for thirty years he had not dined from home. He had read &s;o many manu&s;cripts, that his &s;ight failed, and he lo&s;t the u&s;e of one eye. By candle-light he could not read; and it was his cu&s;|tom to clo&s;e his windows at du&s;k, and then to <HI>write</HI> his Hi&s;|tories. But as he could not authenticate his anecdotes, by con&s;ulting the memoirs which had been furni&s;hed to him from the King's Library, in which there is a collection from 8 to 10,000 M&s;&s;. he tru&s;ted to his memory. This naturally pro|duced his confu&s;ion in facts; what belonged to one kingdom was given to a neighbouring country; what related to one per&s;on was transferred to another.</P>
<P>It is therefore po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that neither Varillas nor Burnet intended to impo&s;e on the world. But from the&s;e anecdotes we may inforce a very important maxim, that an Hi&s;torian mu&s;t not write as <HI>facts</HI> what he only collects from <HI>memory;</HI> he mu&s;t authenticate his &s;ources, whatever they may be, by correct citations. If he does otherwi&s;e, he is not to be tru&s;ted; for however hone&s;t may be his intentions, it is certain that he will not only impo&s;e on his reader, but im|po&s;e on him&s;elf.

<P>Men of genius catch in&s;piration from that of others. Their mind is not always pre|pared to pour forth its burning ideas; it is kindled by the flame which it &s;trikes from the colli&s;ion of the works of great writers. It was thus that Cicero informs us that he animated his eloquence by a con&s;tant peru|&s;al of the poetry of the Latins and Greeks. Poets awaken their imagination by the ver&s;es of other poets. Malherbe, Corneille, and Racine, before they applied them&s;elves to compo&s;ition, put their mind into its proper tone, by repeating the glowing pa&s;&s;ages of their favourite poets. The mo&s;t fervid ver&s;es of Homer, and the &s;weete&s;t of

It is related of Bo&s;&s;uet, that before he compo&s;ed a funeral oration, he was ac|cu&s;tomed to withdraw for four or five days into his &s;tudy, and read Homer. When he was a&s;ked the rea&s;on of this practice, he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e ver&s;es,

It was thus al&s;o, that a celebrated preacher boldly copied Seneca, the tragedian, in the violent pa&s;&s;ions he a&s;&s;umed; and one le&s;s ardent, but more tender, interwove in his &s;ermons pieces taken from Ovid.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Collections of anecdotes &s;erve as an excellent &s;ub&s;titute for the conver|&s;ations of eminent writers.</NOTE> We now turn to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e literary collections which give the anecdotes and conver&s;ations of celebrated men.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ations of &s;cholars have been collected in ages of literature. That they have not been formed with that care, and that &s;election they merited, has been the only cau&s;e of their having fallen into di&s;repute. With &s;uch &s;ub&s;titutes we are enabled, in no ordinary degree, to reali&s;e the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who are no more; and to become more real cotemporaries with the great men of another age, than were even their cotempo|raries them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Are we not all de&s;irous of joining the &s;ociety of eminent men? It is a wi&s;h of even the illiterate. But the &s;en&s;ibility of genius &s;hrinks tremblingly from the contact of the vulgar, and the arrogance of learning will not de&s;cend to their level. They prefer a contemplative &s;ilence, rather than incur the chance of being in&s;ulted by their admiration.</P>
<P>Few therefore can be admitted to their conver&s;ations. Yet when a man of genius di&s;plays conver&s;ible talents, his conver&s;ations are frequently more animated, more ver|&s;atile,
<PB N="51" REF="57">
and, I mu&s;t add, more genuine than his compo&s;itions. Such literary conver&s;a|tions may be compared to waters which flow from their &s;ource; but literary writings re&s;emble more frequently an ornamented fountain, who&s;e waters are forced to elevate them&s;elves in artificial irregularities, and &s;parkling tortuo&s;ities.</P>
<P>The&s;e collections are productive of utility. A man of letters learns from a little conver|&s;ation which has been fortuitou&s;ly pre&s;erved; a ca&s;ual hint which was gathered as it fell; and an ob&s;ervation which its author might never have an occa&s;ion to in&s;ert in his works, numberle&s;s my&s;teries in the art of literary compo&s;ition; and tho&s;e minute cir|cum&s;tances which familiarize us to the genius of one whom we admire, and whom &s;ometimes we a&s;pire to imitate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations on the de|light of lite|rary hi&s;tory.</NOTE> Literary hi&s;tory has indeed been pur&s;ued with a pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s by our fir&s;t &s;cholars. I will not wander from home on this occa&s;ion, though our neighbours far &s;urpa&s;s us in this plea&s;ing &s;pecies of erudi|tion. Dr. John&s;on has &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'It was what he mo&s;t loved.'</Q> It is curious to ob&s;erve, that he begins his Biography of our Poets,

Dr. Warburton has called literary hi&s;tory, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ubject in the world.'</Q> Dr. Warton, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Genius of Pope, has pre|&s;ented us with an admirable &s;pecimen in what manner literary anecdote may be in|troduced for the illu&s;tration of an author, and delight of the reader. Peli&s;&s;on, in his Hi&s;tory of the French Academy, has made an ob&s;ervation on literary hi&s;tory, which will find an echo in the bo&s;om of every man of letters. He writes, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Had we any particulars remaining of what pa&s;&s;ed between Augu&s;tus, Mecenas, and the cele|brated wits of their age, I know not whe|ther we &s;hould read this hi&s;tory with le&s;s curio&s;ity and delight than that of the wars, and affairs of the government of tho&s;e times. Perhaps (to &s;ay &s;omething more) we &s;hould not read it with le&s;s utility and in&s;truction: we, I &s;ay, to whom Fortune has given, nor armies to conduct, nor politics to govern; but to whom &s;he has

Another work of a congenial ca&s;t, is Hawkins's Life of John&s;on, who&s;e genius revived that of the &s;our Wood. Mr. Nichols, in his Life of Bowyer, has made a mo&s;t valuable acce&s;&s;ion of cotem|porary anecdote; perhaps a happier ar|rangement, and a more copious critici&s;m, are de&s;ireable. Mr. Bo&s;well, in his Life of John&s;on, has exqui&s;itely gratified the ama|teur of literary anecdotes. To compare it with Monnoye's edition of the Menagiana, would not be doing ju&s;tice to this work, which is almo&s;t as &s;ingular in it's nature, as it's merit. It is with plea&s;ure that I per|ceive of late, that &s;everal writers of ta&s;te have not con&s;idered it as beneath their powers to become commentators. Mr. T.

<P>When Richard&s;on, the father, gave the life of Milton, he did not compo&s;e it in the ordinary &s;tyle of biographers. If we take away &s;ome of his excentricities, his manner is admirable.

is the con&s;equence of &s;uch idle biography? With much trouble we find, at length, that the genius of either remains yet to be known. One poet is made to re&s;emble another; and, what is wor&s;e, a poet re&s;embles a lord chan|cellor. Richard&s;on, a Miltonic enthu&s;ia&s;t, was be&s;t qualified to give the biography of Milton an enthu&s;ia&s;t. He did not remain &s;atisfied with collecting the information which indu&s;trious enquiry produced, but he &s;tudied to give the character of Milton from his own de&s;criptions. He connected, with an ardour of re&s;earch, for which po&s;terity &s;hould be grateful, from all his works, in ver&s;e and in pro&s;e, the minute circum&s;tances, and peculiar &s;entiments, which our &s;ublime poet had recorded of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In reading this &s;ketch of the manners, and the genius, of Milton, we &s;eem to live with him; we participate in the momen|tary griefs which afflicted him, and the momentary triumphs in which he exulted.

<P>And what does Milton &s;ay on his blind|ne&s;s, when his enemies reproach him with it as a crime?

<P>Richard&s;on would have con&s;idered him|&s;elf as fortunate, had he been enabled to add another lively &s;cene to the dome&s;tic life of Milton.

The&s;e little facts de&s;cribe more forcibly than the mo&s;t eloquent declamation, tho&s;e &s;ecret mi&s;eries which preyed on the heart of Milton, and which mu&s;t not only have di&s;turbed his &s;ub|lime contemplations, but impeded the vi|gour of his fancy, and the corrections of his critici&s;m.</P>

Milton had perhaps wandered in the fields of fancy, and con&s;oled his blindne&s;s with li&s;tening to the voice of his nation, that was to have re&s;ounded with his name. To Virgil, and Ta&s;&s;o, and Ario&s;to, not his ma&s;ters but his rivals, their country had not been ungrateful. One had ba&s;ked in the &s;un&s;hine of a court; the other had &s;een the laurel wreath prepared for him at Rome; and the la&s;t lived to hear his name repeated in the &s;treets, and &s;aluted as the poet of his nation. Milton had enriched his na|tional poetry with two epics&mdash;what were his rewards? Milton con&s;idered him&s;elf as fortunate in having one female who did not entirely abandon him; and one ob&s;cure fanatic, who was plea&s;ed with his poems becau&s;e they were religious.

It is perhaps more de&s;ireable to have &s;uch literary collections at hand.

I have &s;een him frequently return with his hand|kerchief full of &s;tones, mo&s;s, flowers, and &s;imilar objects, which he was de&s;irous of painting exactly after nature.

<P>And what poet is not intere&s;ted in this literary anecdote of a kindred nature, which John&s;on has recorded of Pope?

If conver&s;ation offered any thing that could be improved, he committed it to paper. If a thought, or perhaps an ex|pre&s;&s;ion more happy than was common, ro&s;e to his mind, he was careful to write it; an independant di&s;tich was pre&s;erved, for an opportunity of in&s;ertion; and &s;ome little fragments have been found contain|ing lines, or parts of lines, to be wrought upon at &s;ome other time.'</Q></P>
<P>From the&s;e anecdotes I conclude, that a &s;tudent mu&s;t be more intere&s;ted in what re|lates to a Pou&s;&s;in and a Pope, than to a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on and a Tom Jones. Such notices as the above, relating to illu&s;trious characters, are &s;o many incidents in the vo|luminous romance of life; and when &s;uch names are mentioned, they are &s;ufficient to

We learn from the&s;e anecdotes of Pou&s;&s;in and of Pope, that a painter mu&s;t bring home mo&s;s and flowers, and a poet &s;entiments and images.

The painter does not always require his ea&s;el to paint, nor the poet his poem to compo&s;e; their genius accompanies them in their walks, and in their conver&s;ations.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s I &s;hall read the works of the

His conver&s;a|tion was as &s;atirical concerning tho&s;e he did not e&s;teem, as it was grateful to his friends and patrons. Such was the poet of the &s;ombrous and &s;atiric Inferno!</P>
<P>He who is the model of tender &s;onnets, and the poet of the Loves and the Graces, was beautiful in his per&s;on, enchanting in his conver&s;ation, while his eloquence en|raptured his delighted auditors.

<P><PB N="72" REF="78">
The licentious writer of the mo&s;t agree|able pro&s;e in Italian literature, had neither the &s;ublime melancholy of Dante, nor the enchanting politene&s;s of Petrarch. In the travels which, in his youthful years, he made in the character of a merchant, he had acquired his variety of knowledge of human nature, and a decided ta&s;te for that freedom of gaiety, which does not always &s;pare the blu&s;hes of the mode&s;t, and the tremors of the pious. Love, good eating, and polite literature, were his divinities. He was big and corpulent, an able drinker, an excellent companion, and an adorer of the ladies. The prie&s;ts, at length, frightened poor Boc|cacio, as they afterwards did his happy di&s;ciple La Fontaine. Boccacio &s;uddenly became re|&s;erved, &s;olitary, and melancholy; his &s;tudies
<PB N="73" REF="79">
partook of his di&s;po&s;itions, for, after his con|ver&s;ion, (Tirabo&s;chi &s;ays) he produced no|thing that we can read. One is inclined to lament that he became religious.</P>
<P>It is not ami&s;s, when one reads the mi|&s;anthropic works of Hobbes, to recollect, that the philo&s;opher of Malme&s;bury wrote many of them in a manner which, perhaps, has rendered them &s;o rugged. We are told, that &s;oon after dinner he would retire into his &s;tudy, and have his candle, with ten or twelve pipes, placed by him; then &s;hut|ting the door, he began &s;moaking, thinking, and writing. From a man who would &s;moke at his writings ten pipes, it was but natural they &s;hould retain &s;omething of the dull effluvia of the tobacco.

<P>Yet let it not be con&s;idered, that, how|ever &s;en&s;ible I may appear to the charms of &s;triking anecdotes, I do not perceive that frequently they are frivolous, in&s;ipid, and incon&s;equential.

<P>Dr. John&s;on, who has devoted one of his periodical papers to a defence of anecdotes (&s;ome part of which has been properly quoted by Mr. Bo&s;well) expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf
<PB N="76" REF="82">
thus, on certain collectors of anecdotes: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'They are not always &s;o happy as to &s;elect the mo&s;t important.

becau&s;e Mr. Bo&s;well, who gives this intelligence, mu&s;t feel an intere&s;t in the mi|nute&s;t circum&s;tance which related to him.

This admirable biographer &s;hould have told us, if he frequently turned from his very unea&s;y attitude. Somebody informs us, that Guy Patin re&s;embled Cicero, who&s;e &s;tatue is pre&s;erved at Rome; on which he enters into a compari&s;on of Patin with Ci|cero.

Baillet loads his life of De&s;cartes with a thou&s;and minutiae, which le&s;s di&s;grace the philo&s;opher than the

That he wore green taffety in France; but that, in Holland, he quitted taffety for cloth; and that he was fond of omelets of eggs? There are writers who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between &s;uch frivolous particulars, and tho&s;e anecdotes which con|vey &s;ome &s;triking &s;entiment, characteri&s;tic of a &s;ublime genius.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of a writer of anec|dotes.</NOTE> I &s;hall now clo&s;e this Di&s;&s;ertation, by at|tempting to &s;ketch the character of a writer of anecdotes.</P>
<P>To collect anecdotes, is the humble la|bour of indu&s;try; but not to pre&s;ent them with reflection, with acumen, and with ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It is a ta&s;k, not unworthy of genius, to arrange the&s;e minute notices of human na|ture,
<PB N="81" REF="87">
and of human learning. A writer might yet delight us, by a collection of topics which &s;hould illu&s;trate manners, hi&s;tory, and literature: his talents mu&s;t be ver&s;atile, yet powerful. A writer of anecdotes has difficulties to encounter, from which the biographer is exempt. A biographer has but the peculiarities of an individual to &s;eize; he has only to a&s;&s;imilate his genius to that of another per&s;on. He plays but with one ball, and practice will teach his hand to gra&s;p it with adroitne&s;s: a writer of anec|dotes throws with &s;everal. It becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an one to render him&s;elf familiar with the multiform &s;hapes of na|ture her&s;elf. Is &s;uch a writer to give anecdotes of a Gray, a Milton, or a Sterne? his &s;oul mu&s;t be &s;oftened with the querulous melancholy of Gray; au&s;tere with the re|publican fiercene&s;s of Milton; and varied with the gaiety and the pathos of Sterne. Anecdotes are but &s;qualid &s;keletons, unle&s;s they are full of the blood and fle&s;h of re|flection. If our writer does not feel with the &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te, his reflections may be ju&s;t, but trivial; his &s;tyle mu&s;t be diver|&s;ified by the variety of pa&s;&s;ion; he mu&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="88">
know to mourn and to rejoice. Does he pre&s;ent the anecdotes of war, of per&s;ecution, of &s;uper&s;tition&mdash;his periods mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume a higher tone; his &s;entiments mu&s;t overflow his facts; and his heart mu&s;t be more occu|pied than his memory. Does he give the anecdotes of conviviality, of wit, and of cri|tici&s;m&mdash;his &s;tyle mu&s;t be &s;harp with epi|grammatic pungency, or embelli&s;hed with a thou&s;and graces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This art is what has been &s;o ju&s;tly admired in Fonte|nelle's <HI>Eloges</HI> of the Academicians. Every one is treated in a &s;tyle conformable to the object in which he excelled. The genius of Fontenelle di&s;clo&s;es that of an a&s;tronomer, a phy&s;ician, a morali&s;t, a geometrician, and a poet, as if either of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions had formed the &s;tudies of his life.</NOTE>. He is no inferior arti&s;t who mu&s;t occa&s;ionally alarm with the ter|rifying &s;ublimity of an Angelo, or enchant with the &s;oftened beauty of an Albano.</P>
<P>A writer of anecdotes &s;hould write of emi|nent characters, as they would them&s;elves have written of others. He mu&s;t therefore po&s;&s;e&s;s a portion of that genius which he records.</P>
<P>If I have not rai&s;ed the character of &s;uch an author to an unnece&s;&s;ary and imaginary perfection, our writers of anecdotes have yet an excellence to attain. </P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="89">
That cannot be imaginary, which has been already effected; nor unnece&s;&s;ary, which adds new gratifications to a refined ta&s;te. I have already mentioned, as models in the art of anecdotical compo&s;ition, the illu&s;trious names of Fontenelle, D'Alembert, and Du Bos. I have been compelled, on this occa&s;ion, to cite the literature of a rival nation. Yet, if our writers of anecdotes could unite the va|rious learning of Dr. Warton to his fine ta&s;te, his exact judgment, and his exqui&s;ite art of introducing anecdote, we perhaps might have writers who were worthy of being cla&s;&s;ed in the rank of the Fontenelles.</P>
