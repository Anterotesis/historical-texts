<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>SIGISMOND, the &s;on of the Emperor Charles IV. was elected King of Hungary 1386, and Emperor of Germany 1410. His fir&s;t wife, Mary, being dead, he e&s;pou&s;ed, about the year 1414, Barbara, the daughter of Hernan, Count of Cilley. Sigi&s;mond made the Counts of Cilley independent Princes of the Empire; and called them to the Diets, without the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, their &s;upreme Lords, who, unwilling to emancipate the County from its depend|ance upon them, declared war again&s;t the Count in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. By Barbara, Sigi&s;mond had only one child, a daughter, named Elizabeth. Sigi&s;mond died 1437.</P>
<P>Albert V. Duke of Au&s;tria, who had married Elizabeth, Sigi&s;mond's daughter, &s;ucceeded him in the Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary. Albert died 1440, leaving two daughters; his Queen Elizabeth was big with child at the time of his death; the child proved a &s;on, and was named Ladi&s;laus.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Albert II. as Emperor, and V. as Duke of Au&s;tria, his cou&s;in, Frederick, great grand&s;on of Albert II. Duke of Au&s;tria, was imme|diately elected Emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="17">The Hungarians, almo&s;t con&s;tantly engaged in war again&s;t the Turks, either for the defence of their own country, or of the neighbouring &s;tates, deemed an infant Prince and a Queen Regent unequal to the &s;afe government of a kingdom which, by frequent wars, was kept in continual alarm. The crown of Hungary, by the con&s;titution of the kingdom, being elective, (though &s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion) Uladi&s;laus, the young King of Poland, was cho&s;en King, by the advice of John Corvin Huniades, Earl of Bi&s;trie, whom Uladi&s;laus made Vaywode of Tran&s;ylvania. Huniades was as cele|brated for his virtues as for his valour. He was pious towards God, faithful to his country and his prince, and kind and benevolent to his friends; as a warrior he was politic, of invincible courage, and mo&s;tly for|tunate: he was the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian commander who &s;howed that the Turks might be overcome; and he obtained more victories again&s;t them than any one of the Chri&s;tian Princes before him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William Temple &s;ays that, "Huniades was one of the three Worthies who de&s;erved a Crown without wearing one." The reward, merited by the virtues and great talents of the father, was paid to the &s;on; for in 1458, the Hungarians, from their love to Huniades, and grate|ful remembrance of his long &s;ervices, cho&s;e his &s;on, Matthias Corvinus, for their King.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, unable to prevent this choice, put her &s;on, Uladi&s;laus, under the protection of the Emperor Frederick III. Thus, of Albert's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, only Au&s;tria, and the kingdom of Bohemia, remained un|alienated from his po&s;thumous &s;on, Ladi&s;laus.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="18">In the battle of Varna, 1444, fought between the Turks, commanded by their King, Amurath II. and the Hungarians, led by Huniades, Uladi&s;laus the King of Hungary was &s;lain; Huniades, by who&s;e &s;ide he fought, having left him to go and rally the left wing of the Chri&s;tian army.</P>
<P>The Hungarians now elected Albert's &s;on Ladi|&s;laus King; and they cho&s;e Huniades, their General, Governor of Hungary during his minority. The Em|peror Frederick detaining the infant King in Ger|many, Huniades, as Governor of Hungary, declared war again&s;t him. After a long conte&s;t, which the Hungarians were obliged to intermit, on account of their wars again&s;t the Turks, the Emperor, not &s;trong enough to defend his dominions from being ravaged by the incur&s;ions of the Hungarians, at la&s;t in 1452 delivered up their king; then eleven years of age. An a&s;&s;embly was appointed at Vienna, to which the nobles of Hungary and Bohemia were invited. At this a&s;&s;embly it was decreed that, during the minority of Ladi&s;laus, Huniades &s;hould govern Hungary; that George Podiebrad &s;hould govern Bohemia; and that Ulrick, Count of Cilley, great uncle to the King, &s;hould govern Au&s;tria, and be guardian of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Count Cilley, envious of the glory of Huniades, excited &s;ome parties of Bohemians and Moravians to attack Upper Au&s;tria: but they proved un&s;ucce&s;sful when oppo&s;ed by Huniades. Ambitious of the gov|ernment of Hungary, Count Cilley accu&s;ed Hu|niades, the Governor, to the King; but he ju&s;tified
<PB N="6" REF="19">
him&s;elf from the accu&s;ation. Count Cilley's ambition increa&s;ing with the power which he derived from being the King's guardian; he attempted to make him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Au&s;tria. To effect which, he &s;ecured the principal fortre&s;&s;es, by giving them to the command of unprincipled people whom he had attached to his intere&s;t; gradually removing El&s;inger, and the Au&s;trian nobility, from all offices of import|ance. This conduct gave great umbrage to the people. El&s;inger took advantage of their di&s;content; and, aided by Huniades, obliged Ulrick to retire to his own territory of Cilley. Thus, by the bravery and conduct of the&s;e two warriors, Au&s;tria was wre&s;ted from Count Cilley's u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Mahomet II. the &s;eventh King, and the fir&s;t Em|peror of the Turks, who took Con&s;tantinople May 29, 1453, which his great grandfather, Bajazet I. and his father Amurath II. had un&s;ucce&s;sfully be&s;ieged, marched 1456<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, vol. XXVI. p. 296, there is a mi&s;take in the date of this Siege of Belgrade, which is there put down A.D. 1459; and in vol. XXXII. p. 149, the date is 1456, which la&s;t agrees with other Hi&s;torians.</NOTE> with an army of 150,000 men to be&s;iege Belgrade, then thought the key to Hungary.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the report of Mahomet's intention to be&s;iege Belgrade, reached the young King Ladi&s;laus, then fifteen years of age, he fled to the court of the Emperor Frederick; which much di&s;plea&s;ed his Hun|garian &s;ubjects, as it had before co&s;t them a long and tedious conte&s;t to get him out of the Emperor's power.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="20">Be&s;ides his numerous army, of 150,000 men, Mahomet provided a fleet, of 200 &s;hips and gallies, which he &s;ent up the Danube from Viden to Bel|grade; to the intent that no relief, or aid, &s;hould be brought into the city out of Hungary by the great rivers of the Danube and the Save; upon the con|fluence of which, the city of Belgrade &s;tands. Not contented with thus clo&s;ely blockading the city on all &s;ides, Mahomet &s;ent part of his fleet further up the Danube, and landing troops &s;poiled the country in many places on the banks of the river. On his fir&s;t coming before Belgrade, he made a fierce a&s;|&s;ault, but was repul&s;ed: he found the Hungarians ready to receive him, and prepared to &s;kirmi&s;h with his troops, without the walls, as well as to defend the city. Mahomet, finding his arms &s;o re&s;olutely oppo&s;ed, began to proceed more warily; and in|trenched his army. He provided for its &s;afety, again&s;t the &s;udden &s;allies of the be&s;ieged, by ca&s;ting up deep trenches and &s;trong rampires. After plant|ing his battery, he began to &s;hake the wall of the city mo&s;t furiou&s;ly with his great artillery: in&s;omuch that he battered down a part of it level with the ground. But the defendants with great labour and indu&s;try &s;peedily repaired it, by ca&s;ting up new for|tifications and rampires, &s;o that it was &s;tronger than before.</P>
<P>Campe&s;tran, a Franci&s;can monk, having at this time preached, in Germany, a cru&s;ade again&s;t the Turks, had collected an army of 40,000 men. With
<PB N="8" REF="21">
the&s;e, his followers, he entered Belgrade to a&s;&s;i&s;t in its defence again&s;t Mahomet, who was become the terror of all Chri&s;tendom by his conque&s;ts, his enter|pri&s;ing genius, his capacious mind improved by all the learning of the age, his indefatigable indu&s;try in the pur&s;uit of whatever he undertook, his irre&s;i&s;tible courage, his in&s;atiable cruelty, his avowed impiety, his blood-thir&s;tine&s;s, his immea&s;urable ambition, his impious treachery, and his unrelenting flinty-hearted &s;everity; &s;o that again&s;t his ambition there was no mound, on his faith or friend&s;hip no dependance, and in his lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure death.</P>
<P>Huniades, who was gone to Upper Hungary, to rai&s;e &s;upplies, was expected to &s;ail from Buda, with a fleet of &s;hips and gallies &s;tored with warlike pro|vi&s;ions; when Mahomet, having been a month be|fore Belgrade, prepared to give a general a&s;&s;ault, although his &s;uper&s;titious troops were much di&s;pirited from the appearance of two comets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D'Oh&s;&s;on's Hi&s;t. Gen. of the Othoman Empire, vol. 1. p. 539.</NOTE>; and the death of Carazius the Lieutenant-General, who was killed by a canon-&s;hot from the city; which circum&s;tances they con&s;idered as progno&s;ticks of ill &s;ucce&s;s. At this time, A. D. 1456, Augu&s;t 5, the fleet of Huniades came in &s;ight, and was met by Mahomet's fleet four miles up the Danube beyond Belgrade.</P>

<L>Oh! welcome, Raymond! Ha&s;t thou found my Son?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D. RAYMOND.</SPEAKER>
<L>I hope he lives; yet, where he is I know not.</L>
<L>For from five years of bondage ju&s;t releas'd,</L>
<L>I've vainly &s;ought him, where, by the late King's order,</L>
<L>I with &s;uch happy &s;ecrecy had plac'd him.</L>
<L>His fo&s;ter Father thought him his own Son;</L>
<L><PB N="240" REF="253">For, being ab&s;ent when a dead child was born,</L>
<L>Your living Son was by his wife receiv'd;</L>
<L>And with kind care was nurtur'd as her own.</L>
<L>A Prie&s;t, by me intru&s;ted, form'd his mind,</L>
<L>As 't were through friendly charity and love:</L>
<L>And from this pious Pa&s;tor have I learn'd</L>

<L>Large &s;ums of gold were oft my&s;teriou&s;ly</L>
<L>From him receiv'd; but no trace given to find him.</L>
<L>Anxious, uncertain of his fate, five years</L>
<L>Did his fal&s;e parents mourn. When by a neighbour,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t from Ca&s;tile return'd, they were inform'd,</L>
<L>That he had &s;een their &s;on, but in &s;uch glory,</L>
<L>And credit, at this Court, that his heart fail'd him,</L>
<L>He neither dar'd acco&s;t him, nor declare,</L>
<L>That he had known him once a cottage re&s;ident.</L>
<L>The Sire, with joy tran&s;ported, at &s;uch news,</L>
<L>Set out to &s;eek this boa&s;ted Son, two days</L>
<L>Before I reach'd his dwelling, where I thought</L>
<L>To find Don Sancho &s;afe. Hither I bent</L>

<SPEAKER>Adelinda.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Madam!

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, there was rea&s;on to tremble. I expect that he will give me a good beating in one of his pa&s;&s;ions: for, &s;ure, never was mortal in &s;uch a rage, as he was in with me, la&s;t night. It is very un|fortunate for me, that I have either eyes, under|&s;tanding, or the u&s;e of &s;peech: &s;ince I can neither look, think, nor &s;peak, without putting my father into a mo&s;t horrible pucker.</P>

<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to forbear from being angry with you la&s;t night. I a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hould have joined in re&s;enting your behaviour, but your father's &s;evere determination, after he had com|manded you from his pre&s;ence, terrified me to death; and I forgot my own di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t you, in my

<P>My &s;u&s;picions, as you well know, Madam! have been but too often right. And my Lord Marquis has had too many intrigues, for me, not to &s;u&s;pect him very much, of entering into a new one, when he prevents a pretty girl's marriage, and takes away her Mother's authority, by declaring him&s;elf her Guar|dian.</P>

<PB N="306" REF="316">
her, by telling her of his jealou&s;y. I que&s;tioned her; but &s;he &s;aid &s;he dared not &s;peak what &s;he thought: and ran away from me. I knew not what to think of her flutterings; perhaps &s;he is in love with him her&s;elf.</P>

Yet he charged Lucy not to tell you, that my Lord was in love with her, for fear of making you unea&s;y; but he is &s;ure that he is; and that the girl perceives it, and that as &s;he is quite a village coquette, an artful little monkey, &s;he will know how to &s;ecure her conque&s;t.</P>

Her grace|fulne&s;s, her under&s;tanding, her beauty, are enchant|ing; and the delicate mode&s;ty of her deportment adds a thou&s;and winning graces to the bloom of youth, in the mo&s;t lovely, animated countenance, that I ever beheld.</P>

<P>You de&s;cribe her to be charming indeed, my Lord!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;cribe her, as &s;he is, with beauty that in&s;pires love, and a mind that creates e&s;teem. She &s;trikes, at once, as an accompli&s;hed, and attracts as an amiable, elegant, young woman.</P>

<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, Madam! I do not exag|gerate; what I tell you is the &s;imple truth: I have been conver&s;ing with her this hour in my &s;tudy. Dorcas, through fooli&s;h vanity, has given her an ex|cellent education, and, for her years, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at her knowledge. I mo&s;t &s;incerely pity the &s;uffering which the elegant mind of this gentle Girl mu&s;t
<PB N="309" REF="319">
endure, in being &s;ubjugated to the authority of &s;o rough, and turbulent a woman, as Dorcas is; and I feel the tendere&s;t friend&s;hip for this poor child.</P>

<P>The poor Girl applied to me, to &s;et a&s;ide her Mother's project, of marrying her to Stra&s;|bourg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchione&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems to me, my Lord! that Stra&s;bourg's propo&s;al does her much honour; even with all the beauty which you de&s;cribe her to have, &s;he could &s;carcely expect &s;o advantageous an offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;he te&s;tified &s;o &s;trong an aver&s;ion for him, that, through pity for her, I ab&s;olutely forbad the marriage.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marchione&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stra&s;bourg has &s;ent to me, through Lucy and Flora, to beg that I will &s;peak to you in his behalf; therefore permit me to become his advo|cate. I &s;hall e&s;teem it as the highe&s;t favour done to me, if you will put him again upon good terms with Dorcas and her Daughter; and per&s;uade the Girl to accept of &s;o good an offer of marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>

<SPEAKER>Marchione&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>How impo&s;&s;ible, my Lord&punc; Dorcas&punc;
<PB N="310" REF="320">
it &s;eems, had con&s;ented, very wi&s;ely, to the marriage. And why, my Lord! &s;hould you protect a rebellious, vain Girl in her oppo&s;ition to her Mother's authority and judgment? You &s;hould rather enforce her obe|dience, than encourage her in her undutiful ob&s;tinacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Marquis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zella, Madam! did not want to have her obedience to her Mother enforced upon her. The &s;weet Girl was ready to obey her unfeeling mandate, with all the re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a Daughter, and all the re&s;ignation of a martyr. I declare to you, Madam! that, but for her tears, I &s;hould have thought an angel &s;tood before me, when, after pleading for pity in vain, &s;he &s;poke the &s;trong &s;en&s;e which &s;he had of her duty to her Mother, and of her re&s;olution to obey her, though at the price of all her future happine&s;s. Then, and not till then, I interpo&s;ed my authority in her favour. The thoughts of her being devoted to mi&s;ery pierced my heart with grief; whil&s;t the fortitude of her re&s;ignation almo&s;t awed me. I cannot con&s;ent that &s;he &s;hall be driven to de&s;pair; it would be a deep &s;uffering to my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>

<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>HENRY De S&mdash;, Baron of D&mdash;, was betrothed to Eulalia De L&mdash;e, a Daughter of the Marquis De L&mdash;e. An offer more &s;uitable to the ambi|tious views of the Marquis, being made to him, for his Daughter; he compelled her to write a refu&s;al to her fir&s;t Lover, which was accompanied by a per|emptory one from him&s;elf. The young Lord, unable to bear the thoughts of &s;eeing the amiable woman he doated on given in marriage to another, &s;ecretly quit|ted his hou&s;e; leaving a letter behind him, written in a &s;tyle which indicated a mind bordering on de&s;pair and madne&s;s, declaring that all &s;earch after him would be in vain; de&s;iring, in a formal manner, that his Kin&s;|man might, as his Heir, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Titles and E&s;tate, giving to Eulalia De L&mdash;e, all the for|tune of which he had a right to di&s;po&s;e. Let her be told, adds the unhappy De S&mdash;, "that this mu&s;t be looked on as a Brother's, not a Lover's gift: that Duty and Virtue forbid the Wife of the Duke of &mdash; to &s;hed one tear of Love, to the Memory of the Baron De S&mdash;; let one wretched Victim to affection &s;uf|fice
<PB N="382" REF="391">
&mdash;let him be forgotten.&mdash;May Heaven ble&s;s her. &mdash;Give her, great God! the happine&s;s which might have fallen to my &s;hare!&mdash;add my date of days to hers!!&mdash;!"</P>
<P>When this young Nobleman di&s;appeared, it was imagined from the whole tenor of his incoherent Letter, addre&s;&s;ed to &s;everal friends, in different parts, but directed to no one; from his taking nothing of value with him, and leaving even his pur&s;e in his ink&s;tand, that he left his hou&s;e with an intention of putting an end to his Life. And, though after the mo&s;t careful &s;earch, his body was not found, yet it was &s;till believed that he had completed his &s;hocking purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Di&s;gui&s;ed in the Habit of a Pilgrim, Henry De S&mdash; went to the Abbey of La Trappe, in the Pro|vince of Perche, in the dioce&s;e of S&eacute;ez. He gained admi&s;&s;ion. And the Father Abbot immediately re|ceived him into the fraternity. The Rules of this order are more au&s;tere than tho&s;e of any other of the Romi&s;h Church. Perpetual &s;ilence is enjoined to the Monks. They are allowed neither to receive nor write letters. None of their friends may &s;ee them, &s;o that they are totally ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es in the World. Their only food is Bread and Pul&s;e; their drink Water. Meat, Fi&s;h, Eggs, Milk, Butter, Wine and Oil, are forbidden to them.&mdash;They are not al|lowed to &s;tudy. The Bible, and a very few books of &s;evere morality and &s;elf-denial, compo&s;e the whole Library of a Monk of La Trappe. They live a very
<PB N="383" REF="392">
laborious Life, cultivating the earth, or following &s;ome manual employment, &s;uch as they are found mo&s;t fitted for. The Father Abbot only is allowed to &s;peak. When they are in the la&s;t agonies of Life, they are placed on a Bier covered with Straw and A&s;hes; and carried into the Church. They lie on this Bier till they expire: and if they retain the power of &s;peech, in this la&s;t &s;trife of Nature, their Vow of Si|lence is di&s;pen&s;ed with; in order that they may ex|hort their Brethren: this permi&s;&s;ion has &s;ometimes given ri&s;e to very affecting &s;cenes and di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>The uncommon &s;everities which the young Baron De S&mdash; was obliged, by the Rules, to practi&s;e in the Mona&s;tery of La Trappe, injured his health. He had &s;ound retirement, but not peace. The continual agita|tions of his mind, which conver&s;e with the friendly part of the World might have relieved, di&s;turbed his rea&s;on, after he had been in this gloomy &s;olitude two years. The Monks of La Trappe dig a part of their Grave at certain &s;tated hours: Whil&s;t employed in this occupation, Henry's now weakened mind pic|tured the form of his once-loved mi&s;tre&s;s &s;inking into it: This impre&s;&s;ion once made upon his imagina|tion, con&s;tantly returned, at the &s;ame place, and time. His rea&s;on was not enough extingui&s;hed to make him &s;uppo&s;e Eulalia really pre&s;ent; but the picture once formed by his di&s;ordered imagination was &s;o &s;trong, that he thought it a Vi&s;ion: Impre&s;&s;ed from this Idea, the coinage of his weakened rea&s;on, he determined, difficult and dangerous as the execution of &s;uch a
<PB N="384" REF="393">
de&s;ign was, to e&s;cape from La Trappe: as he thought that Eulalia's appearance to him indicated a want of &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which it might be in his power to give to her. Forbidden by the Rules of his order to &s;peak but in prayer; and all the Brethren avoiding one another, except at Church, as much as po&s;&s;ible; the &s;tate of Henry's mind, balancing between rea&s;on and madne&s;s, of which he him&s;elf at times was &s;en&s;i|ble, e&s;caped ob&s;ervation. He got away among&s;t a number of Pilgrims who came to La Trappe to per|form &s;ome acts of devotion; di&s;gui&s;ed in the very dre&s;s which he had on two years before, when he entered the Mona&s;tery.&mdash;How or where he parted from the other Pilgrims is not known.</P>
<P>After the &s;econd day's travelling, in the depth of a &s;evere Winter, he was benighted, on a heath: he wandered there for &s;ome hours, till his &s;trength and vital heat, &s;pite of the hard&s;hips to which he was accu&s;tomed, were nearly exhau&s;ted, when his undirected &s;teps brought him to the Convent of Meu|don. Father Hubert found him kneeling in the Portico of the Church, as he came out, from cele|brating Midnight Ma&s;s. The Benevolent Prie&s;t &s;eeing a way-worn Pilgrim, at that time of the night, in &s;uch an unprotected &s;ituation, invited him to his Cell. After he had been refre&s;hed there; confidence in the fame-known character of Father Hubert, de&s;pair, and the workings of a di&s;ordered imagination, joined to make him di&s;cover his wildly conceived de&s;ign. Father Hubert attempted to win him from his purpo&s;e of
<PB N="385" REF="394">
pur&s;uing his journey; he could not find which way he was bending his cour&s;e, and he feared to a&s;k him too many que&s;tions. Finding common per&s;uafion, and what force he could oppo&s;e to him ineffectual, to deter him from continuing his journey; he feigned to &s;u&s;pect the real motive of it: but as the te&s;t of the purity of his intentions, Father Hubert offered him|&s;elf to be his conductor, if he would &s;tay till the Noon of the coming day; as in the Morning he was obliged by his office, being Almorer, and Prie&s;t to the Con|vent, to attend and officiate in an extraordinary &s;olem|nity, which was to be performed. Henry accepted of his offer, and, &s;omewhat calmed, &s;pent the remaining part of the night in prayer.</P>
