<P>AS mo&s;t writers, both for and again&s;t the &s;tage, have either dealt out enthu&s;ia&s;tic abu&s;e, or ful&s;ome panegyrics; the obvious utility of an impartial me|dium between &s;uch extremes fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the follow|ing work: no man, who is not either mad or &s;illy, can be hardy enough to deny, that a well-regulated drama is worthy &s;upport in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed, learned, or moral &s;tate; nor, on the other &s;ide, can we con|tend in favour of many e&s;tabli&s;hed pieces; humour has been too often made the &s;ubtle conveyance of very licentious &s;entiments, and many pernicious characters are placed in too fair a point of view; to develope vice from this poetical ma&s;querade; to &s;trip off the &s;erpent's &s;hining coat, and to &s;hew the poi&s;on which lurks within, is the <HI>DRAMATIC CENSOR</HI>'s leading principle; to point out, in a plain manner, and un|adorned &s;tile, the beauties and defects of each piece; to throw out hints re&s;pecting the performance of every character worth notice; and to give a conci&s;e general idea of the plays taken into con&s;ideration, the &s;cope of his de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD THE THIRD. As altered from SHAKESPEARE by CIBBER.</HEAD>
<P>CRITICISM is undoubtedly the mo&s;t elaborate and ungracious of all literary compo&s;i|tions: pa&s;&s;ing cen&s;ure mu&s;t ever be painful to a liberal mind, and has no palliation, no balancing plea&s;ure but contra&s;ted prai&s;e; however, the ge|neral advantages ari&s;ing from candid inve&s;tiga|tion, equally &s;eparated from partial indulgence, or malevolent &s;everity, de&s;erve &s;ome degree of hone&s;t approbation, and &s;trengthen the feelings to undertake with becoming re&s;olution &s;o hazard|ous a ta&s;k,</P>
<P>Dramatic compo&s;itions are of a nature too nice and complicate, for all admirers of the &s;tage to con&s;ider with that attention which is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand them properly; hence much of
<PB N="2" REF="8">
the true reli&s;h and &s;olid improvement derivable from them is lo&s;t, and often changes the theatre from what it literally may be, a profitable &s;chool of moral in&s;truction, to the &s;phere of u&s;ele&s;s or prejudicial di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration has given ri&s;e to the fol|lowing work, in which the various opinions are diffidently &s;ubmitted to, not dogmatically ob|truded upon our &s;everal readers; where we &s;trike out new and u&s;eful lights, we doubt not being allowed &s;ome credit for them; where we appear fallible, indulgence is hoped for; &s;ince however we may err in the exten&s;ive &s;cene before us, our warme&s;t wi&s;hes are to be right.</P>
<P>The hallowed &s;hrine of Shake&s;peare every friend of intrin&s;ic merit mu&s;t approach with re|verence; yet why, amid&s;t the meridian blaze of his brightne&s;s, &s;hould we decline di&s;covering and pointing out tho&s;e dark &s;pots which his ge|nius &s;hares in common with the &s;un; implicit admiration, as well as implicit faith, argues a narrowne&s;s or &s;ycophancy of mind, which we hope our&s;elves free from; and &s;hall, as much as po&s;&s;ible, follow that excellent maxim, <HI>to extenuate nothing, nor to &s;et down aught in malice.</HI></P>
<P>To pur&s;ue all the nice and intricate di&s;tinctions of cla&s;&s;ical critici&s;m, would occa&s;ion prolixity; appeal only to the judgments of learned readers, and therefore be totally incompatible with our de&s;ign; which is merely to try each drama as
<PB N="3" REF="9">
a picture of nature, at the bar of nature; and the manners of tho&s;e nations where the &s;cene of each is laid.</P>
<P>Well knowing how in&s;ipid prefatory matter generally is, thus much only is offered by way of Introduction; and we hope the candid reader will from hence &s;ugge&s;t whatever el&s;e may &s;eem e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Of all tho&s;e various &s;ubjects which have en|gaged the Tragic Mu&s;e, none are of equal force and dignity to hi&s;torical ones; from a multiplicity of great and intere&s;ting events, they rou&s;e and command more pa&s;&s;ions than any other; of this Shake&s;peare was a mo&s;t com|petent judge, and happily availed him&s;elf; I &s;ay happily, becau&s;e he not only thereby gained a wide fruitful field for the exertion of his amaz|ing talents; but in a political &s;en&s;e did honour to his country, by delivering faithfully many memorable events, in a much more &s;triking manner than any hi&s;torian could po&s;&s;ibly do; he has al&s;o thereby indulged that commendable na|tional vanity which makes Britons fond of &s;ee|ing Britons di&s;tingui&s;hed on the theatre of life.</P>
<P>RICHARD THE THIRD, as acted, tho' e&s;&s;en|tially Shake&s;peare's, is much indebted for its variety, compactne&s;s, and &s;pirit, to the late Colley Cibber, who&s;e thorough acquaintance with the Stage, well qualified him for regula|ting a plot, and arranging of &s;cenes, which is
<PB N="4" REF="10">
indeed no more than a kind of dramatic mecha|ni&s;m, yet indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>The laureat has been blamed for mutilating other plays of beautiful pa&s;&s;ages to enrich this; but, tho' we admit it to be literary depradation, we mu&s;t rather vindicate than cen&s;ure him; there is little, if any di&s;hone&s;ty in &s;tealing jewels merely to ornament the ju&s;t owner; be&s;ides it &s;hews what Cibber was never accu&s;ed of, mode&s;ty,&mdash;by avoiding &s;tudiou&s;ly the in&s;ertion of his own in|adequate &s;tuff.</P>
<P>This play opens with well-imagined pro|priety, as a plain, &s;imple introduction is the be&s;t preparative to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and climax of inte|re&s;ting events; expectation &s;trained at the be|ginning mo&s;t commonly produces a faint unaf|fecting cata&s;trophe; the previous character of Henry, and the mode of his introduction, pre|judice us in his favour; his philo&s;ophical re|flections are &s;uitable to his depre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, as well as his turn of mind; and Tre&s;&s;el's pa|thetic narration not only &s;erves to rai&s;e our ten|dere&s;t concern for an unhappy king and father, but prepares us with great judgment for what we mu&s;t expect, to find in Glo&s;ter, which de|&s;cription naturally ari&s;ing out of the cir|cum&s;tance, has far greater merit than tho&s;e lugged in headlong merely for &s;ake of expla|nation.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;ome good critics have con|demned &s;oliloquies in general as unnatural; yet
<PB N="5" REF="11">
we mu&s;t venture to contend for their propriety; &s;ince nothing is commoner than for people in private life, warmly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;ubject, to talk as if in conver&s;ation, tho' alone: in this light, Glo&s;ter is very ju&s;tly brought to view, and I doubt if by any other means &s;o &s;triking and copious a picture could have been given of his whole heart in a fir&s;t appearance; nor could any other character have given &s;o happy a de|lineation of him as he does of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act concludes properly with putting a period to Henry's life, which indeed could not have been pre&s;erved any longer with &s;uitable im|portance; and Richard gives an extended idea of his ambitious remor&s;ele&s;s principles in a very characteri&s;tic &s;oliloquy.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;cene with which the &s;econd act begins is a ju&s;t preparation for the funeral of Henry; and tho&s;e ob&s;equies being partly &s;hewn, keep the unfortunate monarch in our remem|brance till more bu&s;tling events &s;uper&s;ede him; Lady Ann's introduction is affecting, but her yielding to him who&s;e hands are &s;till red with the blood of her hu&s;band, and father, ren|ders her future misfortunes rather ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment than motives for pity; however, the &s;cene is wrought up in a very ma&s;terly manner; and in the performance gives &s;cope for capital acting; the concluding part of this act introduces the duke of Buckingham, the Queen-dowager, and acquaints us with king Edward's death: Ri|chard
<PB N="6" REF="12">
al&s;o unveils part of his de&s;ign relative to prince Edward, who&s;e approach and de&s;tination to the tower he announces.</P>
<P>The young King and his brother, the duke of York, make a mo&s;t plea&s;ing apppearance in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the third act: that &s;olid good &s;en&s;e di&s;coverable in one, and the &s;hrewd, pregnant &s;implicity of the other, are admirably &s;truck off; after their departure for the tower, Richard's ear|ne&s;t di&s;clo&s;ure of his views to Buckingham opens a wider field for expectation; and his method of &s;ecuring his cou&s;in to his intere&s;t &s;hews Glo&s;ter an able politician, fit to avail him&s;elf of Buck|ingham's weak, venal di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Lady Ann's treatment in the &s;ucceeding &s;cene manife&s;ts her hu&s;band's brutality more &s;trongly; yet, as we have already hinted, &s;eems no more than a ju&s;t con&s;equence of that unpardonable vanity which led her into &s;uch an unnatural connection.</P>
<P>Buckingham's illu&s;tration of the method u&s;ed by him to work on the citizens, and his treat|ment of them when they enter, &s;how him ver&s;ed in court chicanery; particularly throwing in a remark, 'tis hard&mdash;<HI>The mayor &s;hould lo&s;e his title with his office,</HI> Richard's hypocri&s;y is here painted in a capital manner; and is mo&s;t admi|rably a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the a&s;&s;umed pa&s;&s;ion of his cou|&s;in on one &s;ide, with the &s;ycophantic credulity of the citizens on the other; his reluctance and their per&s;ua&s;ions, like well adapted lights and &s;hades, engage and plea&s;e the attention; which
<PB N="7" REF="13">
is well varied by Richard's &s;udden tran&s;ition to a &s;tate of ambitious exultation, and from thence to a &s;truggle with con&s;cience, which appears to lodge a con&s;tant thorn in his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the fourth act, our feel|ings are turned upon objects of real &s;trong pity; our tears which have cea&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t, are here called forth again judiciou&s;ly in behalf of an unhappy mother, and her helple&s;s infants; the characters introduced to furni&s;h fre&s;h matter for concern are well brought forward, and the Queen's grief is wrought up in an affecting manner; however, we mu&s;t be of opinion, that the &s;cene is not near &s;o intere&s;ting as it might have been made; that lady Ann and the dutche&s;s of York are here mere non-e&s;&s;entials, that the chil|dren do not affect us as they ought, and that all the Queen's &s;peeches, except the la&s;t three, are far too unimportant for her heart-rending &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>Richard, now di&s;covered as King, works up|on Buckingham, by di&s;tant in&s;inuation, to effect his main purpo&s;e, that of de&s;troying the chil|dren; his cautious earne&s;tne&s;s, and the duke's con&s;cientious diffidence, are extremely well con|tra&s;ted; the King's impatience at Buckingham's coldne&s;s, his indifference at the news brought by lord Stanley, his enquiry after, and remarks on his wife Ann, with his &s;ub&s;equent contemptuous treatment of his lukewarm cou&s;in, exhibit great and ma&s;terly diver&s;ification of action.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">The &s;cene between Tirrel, Dighton, and Fore&s;t, &s;hould for two rea&s;ons have been made longer; fir&s;t to have rai&s;ed our pity more, even by the immediate murderers; next, to have given Richard more time for his appearance at the Tower: there are but ten lines from going to meet Tirrel in his clo&s;et, before that impious tool comes on with his followers quite prepared: had he mentioned the premium and the King's favour to lull their &s;cruples, the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been conducted more con&s;i&s;tently.</P>
<P>The King's &s;oliloquy is ma&s;terly; anxious hope and guilty ambition quiver in every &s;ylla|ble; nor is the &s;ucceeding &s;cene le&s;s characteri&s;|tic; Cate&s;by's entrance is well contrived, and gives a good opportunity for that fiery &s;pirit breaking out, which &s;o much animates the remain|der of the piece; Richard's interview with the la|dies, tho' not e&s;&s;ential, in &s;ome mea&s;ure de&s;erves its place, as in it the tyrant is devoted to de&s;truc|tion by a mother's cur&s;e: the following part of this act is as rapid, and as well a conducted &s;eries of intere&s;ting events as ever was exhibited in any drama, and it concludes with a very bold, &s;trik|ing climax of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t &s;cenes of the fifth act are merely preparatory to what follows, and therefore ju|diciou&s;ly &s;hort; Richmond &s;hews him&s;elf &s;uf|ficiently, and &s;tands well contra&s;ted to his anta|goni&s;t. Richard's &s;cene in the tent is as well imagined, to engage the feelings of &s;pectators, and to &s;hew the power of action as po&s;&s;ible; nor
<PB N="9" REF="15">
could gho&s;ts ever be more ju&s;tifiable than here; however we mu&s;t offer a doubt whether &s;uch fal&s;e creations of the brain &s;hould ever be called to view; &s;ince it is mo&s;t certain that they play upon our pa&s;&s;ions in flat and ab&s;urd contradiction to our rea|&s;on; let this point be determined as it may, Cibber &s;hewed ju&s;t critical judgment in rejecting the &s;econd introduction of tho&s;e imaginary exi&s;tences, which we find in Shake&s;peare's Richard; becau&s;e in repre|&s;entation one would have flattened the other, and both mu&s;t have con&s;equently palled. After many martial excur&s;ions, in which the leading character is very happily exhibited, the cata&s;trophe is wrought up to a mo&s;t plea&s;ing event in his death; a circum|&s;tance as con&s;onant to &s;trict poetical ju&s;tice, as it is to hi&s;torical truth. Richmond's conclu&s;ive &s;cene di&s;plays a generous, patriotic di&s;po&s;ition, and is as agreeable as the place it &s;tands in will admit.</P>
<P>Having thus given a general delineation of the plot and arrangement of &s;cenes, it becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enquire for the moral, without which no dramatic piece can have intrin&s;ic worth; in hi&s;to|rical plays we cannot expect much &s;ocial in&s;truc|tion, as they chiefly appeal to national tran&s;actions; however, from Richard the Third we may draw this u&s;eful conclu&s;ion, that no degree of &s;ucce&s;s and grandeur, no gratification of lawle&s;s ambition, however &s;plendid, can &s;till the voice of con&s;cience; which, though unheard by the world, &s;peaks in thunder to the guilty wretch, who bears &s;uch a painful monitor in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">The characters of this piece are many in num|ber, yet exhibit no great variety of contra&s;t, after Richard, Henry, Richmond, the Queen and Chil|dren; all the re&s;t are of a &s;imilar complexion: Richard is truly in point of figure, &s;entiments, lan|guage, and conduct&mdash;him&s;elf alone; however hi&s;torical relation admits doubts of that monarch's per&s;onal deformity, it was certainly well judged to make his external appearance on the &s;tage, emblematic of his mind; and for &s;ake of &s;ingu|larity dre&s;&s;ing <HI>him</HI> only in the habit of the times may be defen&s;ible; but what excu&s;e can be made for &s;hewing him, at his fir&s;t entrance, in as ele|gant a dre&s;s as when king, I am at a lo&s;s to &s;ugge&s;t; does he not, after his &s;cene with Lady Ann, profe&s;s a de&s;ign of ornamenting his per&s;on more advantageou&s;ly? Macbeth, when king, is always di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;econd dre&s;s, why not Richard? a &s;till greater breach of propriety ap|pears in putting mourning upon none of the per|&s;ons at court but the ladies and the children; though Richard pays all other external re&s;pect to the circum&s;tance of his brother's death.</P>
<P>Through three acts Richard appears the clo&s;e di&s;&s;embling politician, and affords no great variety of action; indeed his &s;oliloquies are &s;o long and &s;o frequent, that very few who attempt to repre&s;ent him avoid falling into an in&s;ipid &s;amene&s;s.</P>
<P>In the fourth and fifth acts he breaks out like a flame which has been long &s;mothered; and through the impetuo&s;ity of agitating circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="11" REF="17">
betrays many performers into the error of out-heroding Herod.</P>
<P>The Public have &s;et up Mr. GARRICK as a &s;tandard of perfection in this laborious, difficult part; and if we con&s;ider the e&s;&s;entials, his claim to &s;uch di&s;tinction will immediately appear indi&s;puta|ble; a very deformed per&s;on never ri&s;es above, and &s;eldom up to the middle &s;tature; it is gene|rally attended with an acutene&s;s of features and &s;prightline&s;s of eyes; in the&s;e three natural points our Ro&s;cius &s;tands unexceptionable; variations of voice, and climax of expre&s;&s;ion, in both which he &s;tands without an equal; graceful attitudes, ner|vous action, with a well-regulated &s;pirit, to ani|mate within natural bounds every pa&s;&s;age, even from the colde&s;t up to the mo&s;t inflamed.</P>
<P>Mr. GARRICK al&s;o pre&s;erves a happy medium, and dwindles neither into the buffoon or brute; one, or both of which this character is made by mo&s;t other performers: it is true, there are many pa&s;&s;ages which have a ludicrous turn, yet we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he who occa&s;ions lea&s;t laughter is mo&s;t right; in re&s;pect of marking particular places with peculiar empha&s;is, &s;ome ex|ceptions may be taken, or doubts rai&s;ed again&s;t every per&s;on we have ever &s;een in the part; how|ever, tracing minute lap&s;es of this kind, which after all may be mere matter of opinion, would occa&s;ion too great a digre&s;&s;ion; we &s;hall there|fore only mention three which &s;trike us mo&s;t: the fir&s;t is,&mdash;<HI>I am my&s;elf alone</HI>&mdash;which words are
<PB N="12" REF="18">
often expre&s;&s;ed in a tone of confident exultation, as if he was &s;ingularly above the re&s;t of mankind; whereas adverting to his own unhappy compo&s;i|tion, it &s;hould be uttered with heart-felt di&s;content; and indeed the three preceding lines, which ex|clude him from all &s;ocial intercour&s;e, &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ive of concern.&mdash;The &s;econd pa&s;&s;age is, where Buckingham &s;olicits Richard for his pro|mi&s;e, and Richard meditates in the&s;e lines;
<Q><L>I do remember me, that Henry the &s;ixth</L>
<L>Did prophe&s;y, that Richmond &s;hould be king,</L>
<L>When Richmond was a little peevi&s;h boy.</L>
<L>'Tis odd&mdash;a king&mdash;perhaps&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t line is often &s;poke without a tone of continuation to the word, <HI>perhaps,</HI> which is mo&s;t evidently intended; the third place is in the&s;e lines;
<Q><L>Hence, babbling dreams, ye threaten here in vain;</L>
<L><HI>Con&s;cience, avaunt</HI>&mdash;Richard's him&s;elf again.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is u&s;ual to &s;peak this couplet in one continu|ed climax of pa&s;&s;ion; whereas the two words marked in Italics, &s;hould be uttered in a lower tone, expre&s;&s;ive of mental agony&mdash;Con&s;cience being the con&s;tant di&s;turber of his peace, and a great bar to his re&s;olution, the latter part of the line ri&s;es to a kind of triumphant exultation, which not only varies, but gives force to the expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having placed Mr. GARRICK far before all other competitors in this character, as &s;upporting every &s;cene throughout the whole with very capi|tal merit; it would be ungenerous not to acknow|ledge, that Mr. MOSSOP di&s;plays great powers,
<PB N="13" REF="19">
Mr. SHERIDAN much judgment, and Mr. SMITH con&s;iderable &s;pirit; but had the fir&s;t more deli|cacy, with le&s;s labour; the &s;econd more harmo|ny, and le&s;s &s;tiffne&s;s; the third more variation, with le&s;s levity, their merit would ri&s;e &s;everal de|grees beyond what it is.</P>
<P>Henry's character is compo&s;ed of pathetic dig|nity; in repre&s;entation it &s;hould be &s;tudiou&s;ly re|membered, that his griefs, tho' a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed king and father, &s;hould not be blubbered like tho&s;e of a &s;chool-boy, but &s;hould paint feeling wor|thy the monarch and the man&mdash;The part is ad|mirably drawn, and highly fini&s;hed; yet we can|not remember any performer doing it tolerable ju&s;tice except Mr. DIGGES, who is now, we believe, retired from the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Richmond requires little more than a good fi|gure, free deportment, with &s;mooth, &s;pirited ex|pre&s;&s;ion; yet our theatres have not often filled it with ability: the late Mr. PALMER, tho' no trage|dian, came neare&s;t the idea we can form of it.</P>
<P>The Queen, tho' not wrought up to the pitch her circum&s;tances &s;eem to admit, is a character of much re&s;pect and attention; Mrs. PRITCHARD did more for it in action, than the Author in wri|ting; it is now given to &s;econd and third rates, for what rea&s;on is hard to &s;ay, as there never was, nor perhaps ever will be, an actre&s;s of higher e&s;ti|mation, than the lady ju&s;t named; what &s;he did not think beneath her is certainly equal to any exi&s;ting merit, and the public have an undoubted
<PB N="14" REF="20">
right to expect capital performance wherever it can be introduced; nor &s;hould the ridiculous word, <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> deter managers from fulfilling this point of duty.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments and verification of this tragedy are rather familiarly-nervous, than flowing and affluent; however, the language all through is uniformly characteri&s;tic, unle&s;s we object to a per|&s;on in Henry's &s;ituation &s;tepping a&s;ide to the al|lu&s;ions of <HI>fro&s;ty Cauca&s;us,</HI> and <HI>December &s;now.</HI> Since it is tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon probability and nature, to make a character deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or torn with pa&s;&s;ion, vent poetical &s;imilitudes; for which rea&s;on al&s;o we mu&s;t condemn tho&s;e lines in the la&s;t &s;peech of the fourth act, tho' the thought is really fine, that &s;peak of the <HI>fever worn wretch</HI>; they are generally omitted, but more, we imagine, to re|lieve the actor's utterance, than from any idea of impropriety.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, RICHARD appears much bet|ter calculated for repre&s;entation than peru&s;al, as indeed every bu&s;tling piece mu&s;t be; however, ta&s;te and judgment will not by any means hold it light in the clo&s;et.</P>

<HEAD>THE STRATAGEM. A COMEDY. By FARQUHAR.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Pope declared an hone&s;t man the noble&s;t work of God, &s;o Mr. Addi&s;on pronounced a good tragedy to be the noble&s;t work of man; whether he advanced this opinion from intending to rai&s;e &s;uch a ma&s;terly and permanent monument to his own reputation upon the &s;tory of Cato; or if he did, how much he failed in the great attempt, we &s;hall not at pre&s;ent pretend to determine, but ra|ther yield to Dryden's a&s;&s;ertion, that an epic poem is undoubtedly the mo&s;t arduous and comprehen|&s;ive effort of human genius.</P>
<P>The tragic mu&s;e confe&s;&s;edly claims great pre|eminence over her &s;i&s;ter the comic; yet if we con|&s;ider, that a knowledge of our&s;elves and the world are the be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of our minds, the laughing lady, tho' &s;he mu&s;t yield precedence to dignity, may certainly, upon ju&s;t principles, boa&s;t a greater &s;hare of utility; the elevated pa&s;&s;ions and inci|dents with which we are treated by the former may warm, melt, and a&s;toni&s;h our feelings; while the latter, playing with fancy in its natural, or &s;ome other familiar &s;phere, exhilarates our &s;pirits, puts judgment in good humour, and plea&s;antly pre|pares us to receive &s;ome occa&s;ional nece&s;&s;ary la&s;hes of correction, applied to our vices or follies.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="22">There is one remark relative to the dramatic &s;i&s;ters well worth notice; that, as the elder is le&s;s general, &s;o &s;he is more la&s;ting; her characters and pa&s;&s;ions are the &s;ame through ages; while the younger is forced to draw exi&s;ting peculiarities; which, when their parent fa&s;hion vani&s;hes, di&s;|appear with her, and become ob&s;olete; thus the comedies of Shake&s;peare and Ben John&s;on exhibit ma&s;terly genius; yet as the originals they took their pictures from are unknown, their force and beauty are in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t. When Mr. Garrick's Fribble was fir&s;t played, a &s;mall hat helped con&s;iderably to mark the petitene&s;s and in|&s;ignificancy of his figure; what &s;ort of a hat mu&s;t he wear now to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the pre&s;ent Liliputian head-covers.</P>
<P>We are told, that Wilkes played all his fine gentlemen in full-bottomed wigs, as Cibber did the fops al&s;o; how &s;trange would any thing of that kind appear at pre&s;ent, when even bi&s;hops wear crop-eared bobs; the coxcomb and fine lady of every &s;even years vary con&s;iderably in al|mo&s;t every point of conver&s;ation and deportment, as they do every &s;ingle year in regard of dre&s;s; wherefore the writer of the pre&s;ent day, if he has genius &s;uitable, mu&s;t have great advantage of his predece&s;&s;ors, prevailing manners and originals being on his &s;ide.</P>
<P>There have been in&s;tances of men, very little conver&s;ant in life, writing tolerable tragedies; but we do not remember one, nor do we believe an in&s;tance can be given, of any per&s;on writing
<PB N="17" REF="23">
a comedy of merit, who&s;e intercour&s;e with, and knowledge of, &s;ociety has not been pretty exten|&s;ive.</P>
<P>Unities of time and place are, &s;trictly applied, critical trammels, &s;erving no purpo&s;e but to check the nobler flights of genius; the &s;ame lati|tude of imagination, which can move us from a chamber to a &s;treet, and thence to a grove, may undoubtedly reconcile much greater tran&s;itions; avoiding this very allowable liberty has made mo&s;t of our modern tragedies &s;o barren of incident, that they are heavy and palling to a degree; but tho' moderate freedom is contended for, poetical licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould be avoided; a child to be born in the fir&s;t act, and appear &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years old in the fifth, as we find in the Winter's Tale, throws contempt upon probability, and over|&s;trains the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of credibility; &s;uch a lap&s;e of time is totally unwarrantable; indeed as come|dy is a delineator of familiar life, the unities &s;hould be much more punctually ob&s;erved in her compo|&s;itions than tho&s;e of tragedy.</P>
<P>Thus much premi&s;ed, let us proceed to the in|ve&s;tigation of Mr. Farquhar's la&s;t production; an odd, yet it is hoped, not very blameable com|po&s;ition for a dying author, who&s;e genius, like an expiring taper, has here thrown out &s;everal &s;tronger fla&s;hes of light, than when in a perfect &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The STRATAGEM, more properly &s;o called than <HI>Beaux Stratagem,</HI> takes its name and birth from the declining circum&s;tances of two genteel
<PB N="18" REF="24">
&s;pirited young fellows, who, from their own ac|count, have &s;pent their fortunes, and rather cho&s;e to retire from the circle of gay life, before nece&s;&s;ity &s;ubjected them to contempt; having &s;een many examples of worthy, &s;en&s;ible men, who, wanting full pockets, were not only &s;hunned, but publicly ridiculed by coxcombs of their former acquain|tance, who&s;e finances remained &s;till unimpaired.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of our adventurers travelling to re|pair fortune in the matrimonial way, tho' not &s;trictly honourable, is no way chimerical or impro|bable; and laying the fir&s;t &s;cene in a public-hou&s;e, gives an opportunity of opening the play, and its general de&s;ign, with humour as well as propriety.</P>
<P>The bu&s;tle of Boniface, and the pertne&s;s of Cher|ry, are extremely characteri&s;tic, nor can any thing be better &s;upported than the forward, &s;elf-&s;uffi|cient, talkative landlord is, with his gue&s;ts in the fir&s;t &s;cene; the prai&s;e of his beer, his punctuality re&s;pecting its age, its killing his wife, with the help of u&s;quebaugh, his re&s;ignation upon that circum&s;tance, his tran&s;ition to the characters of lady Bountiful, the other ladies, and Mrs. Sullen, is a well-expre&s;&s;ed chain of connected, humorous nothingne&s;s, which is not a little enlivened by making every per&s;on old Bonny mentions, a &s;ub|ject of appeal to the tankard; his curio&s;ity in &s;ounding Archer about his ma&s;ter, and Archer's whim&s;ical re&s;erve work a comic effect.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of explanation between Aimwell and Archer &s;eems rather e&s;&s;entially the effect of their &s;ituation and &s;cheme, than merely a de&s;igned infor|mation
<PB N="19" REF="25">
to the audience; and Boniface comes in happily to prevent its being tedious; the conver&s;a|tion concerning &s;upper is well wrought up, and Archer's objections to pig and onions judiciou&s;ly thrown in, whether we con&s;ider them as involun|tary ones, forgetting his a&s;&s;umed &s;tation, or as a de&s;ign of giving Aimwell a better opportunity of &s;hewing him&s;elf the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Boniface's comments and conjectures upon the money which Aimwell commits to his care, are &s;uch as might be expected from &s;uch a per&s;on, who appears, under cover of &s;pecious, open bluntne&s;s, to be a rogue him&s;elf, and an encourager of other rogues&mdash;Cherry's di&s;like of his principles recom|mends her&mdash;but when &s;he recals the words, <HI>my fa|ther!</HI> and &s;ays&mdash;

&mdash;&s;he tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es too much upon the bounds of delicacy.</P>
<P>Archer's en&s;uing dialogue with her is &s;pirited, plea&s;ing and natural; females of an inn are deem|ed lawful game both for genteel and &s;ervile tra|vellers; what he &s;ays to her is common-place flat|tery, therefore well-adapted to a gallant footman; her replies are the right drain of bar-maid &s;mart|ne&s;s and wit; her catching at a &s;lip of expre&s;&s;ion, when he &s;ays&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There's a &s;warm of Cupids, my little Venus, which has done the bu&s;ine&s;s much better,"</Q>

name, pari&s;h, &amp;c. not only gives Cherry a plau&s;i|ble rea&s;on for viewing him as a dubious character, but al&s;o affords him a very good opportunity of exhibiting equivocal looks and expre&s;&s;ion; the &s;hort &s;ub&s;equent repartees are extremely plea&s;ant; their concluding with a &s;econd ki&s;s, and Boniface's calling Cherry, give a timely termination to the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, Mrs. Sullen, a married, and Dorinda, a &s;ingle lady, are intro|duced; by their conver&s;ation we find, that the former has been bred up in, and is fond of town-life; that the latter has pa&s;&s;ed her time in, and is reconciled to rural retirement, or at mo&s;t a coun|try town.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sullen, after rallying country plea&s;ures, and giving no very favourable idea of her lord and ma&s;ter, in a de&s;cription as incon&s;i&s;tent with decen|cy, as his behaviour is with good-nature and good &s;en&s;e, approaches the &s;quire on his entrance, with becoming affability, to which he makes very brutal returns; indeed Sullen appears to have no manner of bu&s;ine&s;s here but to draw his own picture when &s;ober, as he does afterwards when drunk; on ordering Scrub to get ready for &s;having his head, the lady throws out a mo&s;t &s;hameful hint concerning his temples, which, to make it more gro&s;s, is in repre&s;entation twice repeated: this gives Scrub, who catches her meaning, an op|portunity of rai&s;ing a gallery-laugh, by the mean, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iful, pantomimical action of repre&s;enting his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> horns with two fingers; this piece of

behaviour &s;hews the lady to be void of &s;en&s;e as well as mode&s;ty; a &s;ervant, and &s;uch a &s;ervant as Scrub e&s;pecially, is a &s;trange confidant for &s;uch an explanation. We heartily wi&s;h the &s;tage-ladies would omit the pa&s;&s;age, and go directly to
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Inve|terate &s;tupidity! Did you ever know,"</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The remainder of this &s;cene has &s;pirit, yet offers but a very faint exculpation for Mrs. Sullen's mode of thinking and &s;peaking; except in that line where &s;he &s;ays to Dorinda,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if I go a &s;tep beyond the bounds of honour, leave me;"</Q> the mention of going to church immediately after &s;uch a conver&s;ation is, I believe, not at all unna|tural in a fine lady.</P>
<P>The &s;hort en&s;uing &s;cene is of very little con&s;e|quence, except containing &s;ome very ju&s;t and keen remarks upon the impre&s;&s;ion that Aimwell's exter|nal appearance is likely to make; the &s;atire, tho' only pointed at a country congregation, might be as ju&s;tly applied to many thou&s;ands in this metro|polis, who are equally devoted to out&s;ide &s;how, and unmeaning curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Gibbet's account of his plunder is plea&s;ant and &s;atirical; Boniface's mention of his two gue&s;ts na|tural, and their joint endeavours to &s;ound Archer, with his eva&s;ive an&s;wers, are truly comic; the in|troduction of Cherry, with her childi&s;h repetition of love's catechi&s;m, pre&s;erves a flow of &s;pirits&mdash; we could wi&s;h the que&s;tion where love <HI>goes out</HI> had been omitted; the di&s;covery of Archer not being a footman is well thrown in, and the girl's pro|po&s;ition of marriage, tho' &s;omething forward, by
<PB N="22" REF="28">
no means unnatural; how &s;he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two thou&s;and pounds immediately at her own di&s;|po&s;al admits &s;ome doubt; Archer's he&s;itation falls well in; Cherry's taking it as a confirmation of his &s;uperior rank ju&s;tifies her di&s;cernment; and the friendly hint concerning her father &s;hows her heart in a very favourable light.</P>
<P>Archer's &s;oliloquy is very pertinent, plea&s;ant and lively, but &s;omewhat ungenerous; where &s;peaking of one who has offered &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial a proof of confidence and regard; he &s;ays&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if the wench would promi&s;e to the when the mo|ney were &s;pent&mdash;egad one would marry her;"</Q>
this may be gallant, but it is mean and mercenary al&s;o. Notwith&s;tanding rhimes or tags, as they are called, appear peculiarly ab&s;urd in comedy, we are willing to forgive the four following for that good &s;en&s;e they exhibit, and that certain truth they &s;o agreeably convey in ver&s;e almo&s;t as ea&s;y and natural as pro&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>For what&s;oe'er the Sages charge on pride,</L>
<L>The angels fall, and twenty faults be&s;ide;</L>
<L>On earth I'm &s;ure, 'mong&s;t us of mortal calling,</L>
<L>Pride &s;aves man oft, and woman too, from falling.</L></Q>
<P>The ladies again pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and inform us that the &s;ingle one has received one of Love's in&s;tantaneous lightening-winged darts from Aim|well's eyes while at church; Mrs. Sullen's raillery in this &s;cene is extremely &s;uitable both to charac|ter and occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is great judgment in re&s;erving one cha|racter or more, to the third, nay even the fourth act; this reinforcement Farquhar has mo&s;t happi|ly
<PB N="23" REF="29">
availed him&s;elf of in the parts of Scrub and Foigard; the former of whom is mo&s;t certainly a child of whim, yet &s;o near nature, and &s;o fraught with laughter, that he mu&s;t plea&s;e; the latter is as much within the rules of critical propriety as po&s;&s;ible, and an object of real entertainment.</P>
<P>Scrub's packet of news, concerning the &s;trange gentleman, cannot be unfolded properly without having a powerful effect; the conjectures he re|lates, and his own, of Aimwell's being a Je&s;uit, becau&s;e his footman talks French, mu&s;t dilate even the rigid mu&s;cles of &s;toici&s;m.</P>
<P>Love, like nece&s;&s;ity, being a parent of inven|tion, we mu&s;t admit the young lady's &s;ending Scrub to cultivate an intimacy with Aimwell's footman as a natural piece of policy; &s;ervants being in general a communicative index to the fortune, family, connections, and qualities of their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, which Archer in his con|ver&s;ation with Scrub &s;eems well acquainted with, and profits by; as we &s;hall find upon coming to that &s;cene.</P>
<P>Aimwell and Archer &s;upport different feelings in their &s;ucceeding &s;cene becomingly; the former &s;peaks of his mi&s;tre&s;s with all the rapture of real pa&s;&s;ion; the latter dwells upon their original view, her fortune; yet &s;teps &s;omewhat a&s;ide, and, with much plea&s;antry, mentions his own adventure with Cherry; his burle&s;que heroics
<Q><L>The nymph who with her twice ten hundred pounds</L>
<L>With brazen engine hot, and coif clear &s;tarch'd</L>
<L>Can fire a gue&s;t, in warming of the bed.</L></Q>
<PB N="24" REF="30">
Are not only a ju&s;t reproof to Aimwell's roman|tic allu&s;ions, but al&s;o a laughable &s;atire upon tho&s;e poetical writers, who appropriate high flown &s;trained images and pompous ver&s;ification to the mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Boniface's di&s;po&s;ition of introducing his gue&s;ts to each other, is truly that of a country landlord; and his attempt to find out Aimwell, when he re|plies to his invitation of Gibbet&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who &s;hall I tell him, &s;ir, would"</Q>
&mdash;is very con&s;i&s;tent with impertinent curio&s;ity and low cunning.</P>
<P>Gibbet's ru&s;ty appearance, and aenigmatical mode of conver&s;ation, are certainly well adapted to his character; Aimwell's que&s;tions are &s;uitable, and hint a ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the pretended captain; Boniface's preparative for Foigard's appearance, in a blundering affectation of knowing men and languages, is very laughable; and the Prie&s;t's joining company enriches the &s;hort &s;cene he is concerned in very con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>Archer and Scrub are now exhibited in a di|verting &s;tate of familiarity; the droll &s;implicity of the latter is a well drawn contra&s;t to the polite &s;hrewdne&s;s of the former, who artfully feels the &s;impleton's pul&s;e, and, under friend&s;hip's a&s;&s;umed veil, winds into the &s;ubject he has in view; this whim&s;ical <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> never fails, even with indif|ferent performace, &s;etting the ri&s;ible faculties at work. Scrub's terrible &s;ecret of being in love with Gip&s;ey is a mo&s;t forceable &s;troke of low humour; and the chain of explanation which ari&s;es from it, concerning the French Count, the Prie&s;t and Mrs.
<PB N="25" REF="31">
Sullen is extremely natural; opening part of the plot &s;eemingly without any de&s;ign of the author; the tran&s;ition to Scrub's various employments very properly puts a &s;top to the conver&s;ation, and the ladies appear in very fit &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sullen's throwing down her fan by way of lure to a footman, tho' a &s;mart agreeable fellow, &s;hews her in the light of a giddy-headed coquette, or &s;omething wor&s;e; it would have been an allow|able method of beginning conver&s;ation with a gen|tleman, but to a &s;ervant in livery violates decorum; be&s;ides it does not an&s;wer the intention, for Scrub is forced to act as ma&s;ter of the ceremonies at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Archer in his conver&s;ation with the ladies, u&s;es judiciou&s;ly that &s;trained &s;tile of expre&s;&s;ion which we may &s;uppo&s;e a coxcombly valet would be fond of; and lady Howd'ye's me&s;&s;age is as poignant a piece of &s;atire upon the unconnected jargon, and unintelligible lumber of words, a fa&s;hionable foot|man's &s;cull is loaded with, as ever was penned; his reply to Mrs. Sullen's &s;urprize at his not being better provided for, came from the author's heart, though now commonly omitted&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was offered a lieutenant's commi&s;&s;ion, but that's not provi|&s;ion for a gentleman."</Q>
This &s;eems a contempt thrown on &s;ubaltern gentlemen, but FARQUHAR felt the forceable truth, having been in that &s;tation him&s;elf; if it was too little forty years ago, what is it now, when every article of life is advanced above a third? and yet military pay remains un|augmented, though judges, and &s;everal officers of &s;tate, who had &s;alaries large enough before, have
<PB N="26" REF="32">
been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. Reader, excu&s;e this &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, &s;trong feelings for a very re&s;pect|able and &s;erviceable &s;et of gentlemen have forced it from us.</P>
<P>Dorinda's information that Archer probably is a companion of my lord's in di&s;gui&s;e, rather palli|ates her &s;i&s;ter's favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards him; but Mrs. Sullen, true to the unblu&s;hing principles of a vicious heart, throws off all re&s;erve in the&s;e words;&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I cho&s;e the count to &s;erve me in a de|&s;ign upon my hu&s;band; but I &s;hould like this fellow better in a de&s;ign upon my&s;elf;"</Q>
&mdash;after &s;uch an explicit declaration, who can &s;ay that this lady de&s;erved a better hu&s;band than Sullen? ne|glect on one &s;ide, long acquaintance, frequent inter|views, and very engaging qualifications, might warp even virtue at an unguarded &s;ea&s;on; but at fir&s;t &s;ight, and &s;uch inferior rank, it is literally too gro&s;s.</P>
<P>Sullen's behaviour is &s;uch as we may expect from him; after his exit, a de&s;ign is mentioned, which as the play is performed, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;covered, for it never comes to action nor expla|nation; the author is not to blame, for by means of the Frenchman, Mrs. Sullen means to awaken her hu&s;band's jealou&s;y; but that character being totally omitted, that matter remains in the dark, unle&s;s &s;omething can be picked up from what Foigard &s;ays afterwards; but how a &s;pectator is to know that for the project here hinted at, we can|not tell.</P>
<P>Lady Bountiful's character is amiable, and Aim|well's feigned &s;ickne&s;s well contrived to gain ad|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="33">
to his mi&s;tre&s;s; the bu&s;tle occa&s;ioned by his mi&s;take is well conducted; but there is a line frequently introduced to create laughter in the up|per regions, which occa&s;ions us to wi&s;h Shake|&s;peare's excellent rule was more enforced by ma|nagers, and better ob&s;erved by performers&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"let your clowns &s;peak no more than is &s;et down"</Q>
&mdash; or if this is too &s;trait a limitation for the mini&s;ters of Momus, we would at lea&s;t have them con&s;ult decency in their own additional wit, nor &s;acrifice it for a little &s;muggled applau&s;e. We have heard what follows frequently &s;poke;&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you &s;hall ta&s;te my water, 'tis a cordial I can a&s;&s;ure you, and of my own making,"</Q>
which Scrub facetiou&s;ly enforces, by &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"do ta&s;te it, &s;ir, for my lady makes very good water;"</Q>
another &s;troke of Mrs. Sullen, for which we mu&s;t criminate the Author, is very offen&s;ive; when Archer &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find my&s;elf very ill at this minute;"</Q>
&s;he replies (a&s;ide indeed) with this emphatic ob&s;ervation;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I fancy, friend, I could find a way to cure you."</Q></P>
<P>Aimwell's introducing his footman to the ladies, is what I believe no peer or commoner ever did in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, notwith&s;tanding the apo|logy of his under&s;tanding pictures.</P>
<P>Foigard's conver&s;ation with Gip&s;ey, entirely ap|pertains to the under plot of introducing the Count into Mrs. Sullen's clo&s;et; the prie&s;t is herein well characterized, too many we fear of that fraternity having made a very bad u&s;e of their influence over Families.</P>
<P>The picture &s;cene between Mrs. Sullen and Ar|cher, if we can reconcile the lady's amorous con|de&s;cen&s;ion,
<PB N="28" REF="34">
contains many plea&s;ing allu&s;ions and delicate compliments, particularly comparing the duke of Marlborough, then in the zenith of glory, to Alexander; the hint of his own di&s;gui&s;e, thrown out in Jupiter's approach to Leda, and a&s;king the lady if &s;he did not &s;erve the painter who pre&s;umed to draw her brea&s;ts, as Jupiter did Salmoneus, for imitating his thunder, are well imagined, tho' in a romantic &s;train: what follows re&s;pecting the bed-chamber is as extraordinary a coup-de-main of gallantry as can be met with, con&s;idering the cir|cum&s;tances of &s;uch different rank, &s;o &s;light an ac|quaintance, time of the day, and company at hand; if the attack be truly Briti&s;h, as Archer in&s;inuates, then are Britons Lions in love. Scrub's entrance is critical and lucky; his confu&s;ed manner of tell|ing the prie&s;t's plot, humourous and natural.</P>
<P>The comparative view of compliments from their lovers, for Mrs. Sullen hone&s;tly owns Archer &s;uch, between her and Dorinda is very &s;pirited; but both the ladies rather call a blu&s;h upon the cheek of mode&s;ty, when one &s;ays&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you can't think of the man without the bed-fellow, I find."</Q>
To which the knowing young lady replies,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I don't find any thing unnatural in that thought; while the mind is conver&s;ant with fle&s;h and blood, it mu&s;t conform to the humours of its company?"</Q>

at lea&s;t the actre&s;s, means; we wi&s;h this arch mode of expre&s;&s;ion, as it is called, was reformed all together; and it &s;oon would be, if public re&s;ent|ment, in&s;tead of applau&s;e, attended it.</P>
<P>In the latter part of this &s;cene the author labours, and with &s;ome effect, to make Mrs. Sullen apolo|gize for her&s;elf; when &s;he &s;peaks of her own heart, and the violence done her feelings by a bruti&s;h, in|&s;en&s;ible hu&s;band; &s;ome rays of partiality will break in upon us for her unhappy &s;ituation; yet her relap&s;e in the&s;e lines bani&s;h them all&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to confe&s;s the truth, I do love that fellow&mdash;and if I met him dre&s;s'd as he &s;hould be&mdash;and I un|dre&s;t as I &s;hould be&mdash;look ye, &s;i&s;ter, I have no &s;upernatural gifts&mdash;I can't &s;wear I could re&s;i&s;t the temptation&mdash;though I can &s;afely promi&s;e to avoid it, and that's as much as the be&s;t of us can do;"</Q>
&mdash;a very pretty compliment truly&mdash; not re&s;i&s;t temptation! then where is virtue? Avoid|ing what may endanger it, is mo&s;t certainly pru|dent; but re&s;i&s;ting &s;olicitation, and curbing our own pa&s;&s;ions, prove integrity&mdash;the cha&s;tity of a Nun, locked up within grates and walls, is no me|rit; but if the &s;ame per&s;on, amid&s;t the gay world, guides her &s;teps in the right path, this is po&s;itive virtue, which we believe a great majority of the fair &s;ex are capable of, and ri&s;es far above that degree of mere negative virtue, which Mrs. Sullen palms upon her &s;ex, having no other principle her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Archer who &s;eems to have no real hone&s;ty from the beginning, confirms it by his remark upon
<PB N="30" REF="36">
Aimwell's &s;aying, when he &s;peaks of Dorinda,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis a pity to deceive her, nay, if you &s;tick to tho&s;e principles, &s;top where you are;"</Q>
Foigard's prevarication, and Archer's detection, are whim|&s;ically droll&mdash;the prie&s;t's catch at Tipperary, and &s;aying he went to &s;chool at Kilkenny, is as natu|ral and plea&s;ant a blunder as we have met with.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;cene between Boniface and the rob|bers, is only introduced to let the audience know the de&s;ign on Mr. Sullen's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>A new character, Sir Charles Freeman, with|out whom the cata&s;trophe could not have been brought about, makes his appearance at the be|ginning of the fifth act, and not only from the landlord, but from the &s;quire's per&s;onal appear|ance and conver&s;ation, gains a confirmation of the di&s;po&s;ition of his hopeful brother-in-law.</P>
<P>The &s;cene between Archer and Mrs. Sullen is &s;upported with great warmth and vivacity; the eclairci&s;&s;ement is wrought up to a &s;trong pitch of pa&s;&s;ion, and becomes very critical, when Scrub's fright, in a very convenient and laughable manner, interrupts it; but Archer's remark upon his di&s;|appointment, is gro&s;s to the la&s;t degree, and &s;hould never be &s;poke&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the very timorous &s;tag will kill in rutting time."</Q>
Scrub's mi&s;taking him for one of the thieves is a natural effect of fear, and varies the dialogue plea&s;ingly &mdash;The &s;eizing of the robbers, and the di&s;po&s;al of them, fall well in; Gibbet's remark, that he mu&s;t &s;ave &s;ome part of his money to bring him off at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, is a keen ju&s;t &s;troke of &s;atire again&s;t that
<PB N="31" REF="37">
vile perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice, which, for bribes, pro|tects rogues who can pay well.</P>
<P>Archer's availing him&s;elf of a &s;light wound to draw lady Bountiful and Mrs. Sullen a&s;ide, that Aimwell may addre&s;s Dorinda to more effect, gives the plot a probable progre&s;s; Dorinda's generous objection to a ha&s;ty marriage, and its delicate ef|fect upon her lover, are very agreeable incidents, not a little heightened by Foigard's di&s;&s;atisfaction at being &s;o often called to no purpo&s;e. Archer's reproach to Aimwell &s;hews him in a very unfa|vourable light&mdash;The unexpected intelligence, brought by Sir Charles Freeman, of Aimwell's &s;ucceeding to his brother's title and e&s;tate, opens our views to a favourable conclu&s;ion, which till this remains judiciou&s;ly doubtful; Archer's con|fu&s;ion, upon hearing of Sir Charles's arrival, &s;hows commendable and nataral &s;pirit; Dorinda's next change is very well imagined, and the rea&s;on &s;he a&s;&s;igns for it &s;hows refined genero&s;ity, which is, that as Aimwell had candidly acquainted her with his poverty, &s;he thinks it her duty to let him know his good fortune before their marriage.</P>
<P>Archer's immediate demand of half the lady's fortune is mean and unmannerly; and Aimwell's replies are &s;omewhat &s;trange for the &s;ituation of things. As this comedy is played, we find Foi|gard mo&s;t ab&s;urdly introduced to &s;peak of the robbery as being told to him, tho' the audience has already &s;een him in pre&s;ence of the &s;ame cha|racters placed as a guard over the thieves; this, by the author, was put into the Frenchman's
<PB N="32" REF="38">
mouth; however, a &s;light alteration may bring propriety to the prie&s;t; only making him enter with&mdash;<HI>Arra, &s;ure there has been another robbery</HI>&mdash; then the mention of Boniface falls in aptly.</P>
<P>Cherry's billet-doux &s;hows hone&s;t attachment, and &s;ure never was &s;o contemptible a return made for genero&s;ity as Archer's di&s;po&s;ing of &s;uch a girl, with two thou&s;and pounds fortune, to be Gip&s;ey's &s;ucce&s;&s;or in Dorinda's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of &s;eparation between Sullen and his wife has a peculiar degree of humour, and deli|neates both the characters plea&s;antly: upon Sul|len's refu&s;ing to refund his lady's fortune, Archer makes a mo&s;t extraordinary propo&s;ition; fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to the ten thou&s;and pounds Aimwell re&s;igns in his favour, then by putting the &s;quire's bank notes and writings into Sir Charles's hands; the&s;e bank notes, &amp;c. we find, were taken by Mr. Gibbet; how Archer came by them we do not &s;o clearly perceive, unle&s;s he picked his pocket when fir&s;t &s;eized; but allowing he does, as may be ju&s;ti|fiable, what right does that give him over the pa|pers, that he &s;hould lay ten thou&s;and pounds mortgage on them? and how amazing a com|pliance is the &s;quire's acquie&s;cence to &s;uch a de|mand? In&s;tead of &s;aying his head, we think he &s;hould reply, <Q REND="inline">"my pocket aches con&s;umedly;"</Q> but all of a &s;udden, he grows the be&s;t natured brute imaginable, and invites them to be as merry as they plea&s;e in his hou&s;e, and at his expence.</P>
<P>If wit be an e&s;&s;ential of comedy, this piece is certainly deficient in that point; for we find &s;carce
<PB N="33" REF="39">
any of tho&s;e un&s;tudied fla&s;hes of imagination which claim that title; however, the dialogue is ea&s;y, &s;pirited, and natural throughout, well varied, and well adapted to the &s;everal characters; the hu|mour forcible, and maintained without de&s;cending too low; the characters well grouped, and the &s;cenes arranged with judgment; yet it is to be lamented, that there are few moral &s;entiments, that the plot is in many places reduced to pitiful expedients for &s;upport; that the principal man and woman are de&s;picable wretches; that human nature is &s;hewn in a very unfavourable light; that &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages rai&s;e gro&s;s ideas; that the volun|tary divorce is ab&s;urd; that Archer and Mrs. Sullen are left in a very un&s;atisfactory, or offen|&s;ive &s;tate; that the whole piece is totally without a moral; and that the four following conclu&s;ive lines have no meaning at all, or el&s;e a very bad one;
<Q><L>Both happy in their &s;everal &s;tates we find,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e parted by con&s;ent, and tho&s;e conjoin'd;</L>
<L>Con&s;ent, if mutual, &s;aves the lawyer's fee;</L>
<L>Con&s;ent is law enough to &s;et you free.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus Mr. Farquhar di&s;&s;olves the marriage-knot, with as much ea&s;e and expedition as Alexander did the Gordian of old; one would think his method had been pretty generally inculcated, and is well received among the great world at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of characters we perceive, that Ar|cher is a gay, &s;en&s;ible, gallant, but unprincipled, young fellow; who&s;e chief wi&s;h is to repair a &s;hat|tered fortune, and obtain plea&s;ure at any rate, ha|zarding hone&s;ty for the one, and &s;ocial, as well as

<P>The attributes for &s;upporting this part, are viva|city of deportment, &s;ignificancy of look, and pert volubility of expre&s;&s;ion; every one of which Mr. GARRICK po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, it is no wonder his perfor|mance &s;hould be capital; the &s;cenes in which he particularly out&s;trips competition, are tho&s;e with Cherry&mdash;where he delivers lady Howd'ye's me&s;|&s;age, and the picture &s;cene with Mrs. Sullen.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH is very &s;prightly, agreeable, and characteri&s;tic; nor is Mr. LEE without con&s;ider|able merit; but &s;till we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that Mr. GARRICK, both as footman and gentleman, main|tains his u&s;ual great &s;uperiority, tho' not &s;o much as where more forceable powers are wanting.</P>
<P>We have been &s;o unfortunate as to &s;ee Mr. SHERIDAN walk through this character; and have heard of Mr. MOSSOP's undertaking it; but the report cannot be true, as it mu&s;t nearly reduce him to the &s;tate of the King of the Antipodes in Cronon, that is, making a top&s;y-turvy part of it, and &s;tanding upon his head.</P>

<P>Scrub is a very marked and &s;triking character; &s;imple, yet cunning; forward, tho' timid; a tat|tler, affecting &s;ecrecy; and a fool, a&s;&s;uming wi&s;|dom: his &s;ituations are happily grote&s;que, and pregnant with much plea&s;antry; a performer mu&s;t have very faint comic powers, who cannot keep an audience in good humour with this part; and yet &s;ome very capital ones have run wild; Mr. THE.

<DIV2 N="Hamlet" TYPE="play">
<PB N="37" REF="45">
<HEAD>HAMLET. Written by Mr. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>THE opening of this tragedy is extremely well devi&s;ed; the time of night, the place, the characters, and what they &s;peak, all mo&s;t natu|rally concur to rai&s;e an awful preparatory appre|hen&s;ion for the appearance of that &s;upernatural agent on whom the main action totally depends; and indeed &s;o artfully has Shake&s;peare wrought upon his great patrone&s;s, nature; &s;o powerfully does he engage our pa&s;&s;ions upon this occa&s;ion, that even tho&s;e who laugh at the idea of gho&s;ts, as old womens' tales, cannot avoid lending an eye and ear of &s;erious attention to this of Hamlet's father.</P>
<P>Introducing him previou&s;ly to &s;ome of the in|ferior characters, brings him with double force upon the principal one; and Horatio's determi|ning to acquaint the prince with &s;o &s;trange and alarming a circum&s;tance is very natural.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of Hamlet's appearance as a mourner, when all the re&s;t of the court are in a &s;tate of fe&s;tivity and congratulation, rai&s;es our idea of his filial affection and concern; his indifferent, contemptuous replies to the King, and his catch|ing &s;o eagerly at the word <HI>&s;eems,</HI> u&s;ed by his mo|ther, are a happy commencement of his character. Laertes's &s;oliciting leave to travel &s;eems merely
<PB N="38" REF="46">
calculated to keep him out of the way, and to learn fencing again&s;t the fifth act.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;oliloquy of Hamlet is particularly &s;triking and e&s;&s;ential, as it lays open in a pathetic, beautiful manner, the cau&s;e of his melancholy, and paints his mother's frailty with &s;trong feeling, yet pre&s;erves a delicate re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The &s;cene which introduces Horatio, &amp;c. to communicate the circum&s;tance of the preceding night &s;ucceeds naturally; and the broken mode of conver&s;ation, in lines and half-lines, is &s;o art|fully contrived, is executed in &s;o ma&s;terly a manner, that the &s;pectators, tho' they previou&s;ly know the &s;ubject, are yet agreeably lured on to hear it re|lated, and thoroughly &s;ympathize in the tran&s;i|tions of Hamlet, who&s;e interrogations concerning the awful amba&s;&s;ador of heaven are &s;uch, as give us a &s;tronger feeling of the Gho&s;t than even his appearance does; on the prince's determination to watch, notwith&s;tanding his violent agitation, he might have u&s;ed a phra&s;e le&s;s cen&s;urable than the following:
<Q><L>I'll &s;peak to it, tho' <HI>hell</HI> it&s;elf &s;hould gape,</L>
<L>And bid me hold my peace.</L></Q></P>
<P>Laertes's &s;hort advice to Ophelia is pregnant with affection and good &s;en&s;e; as Polonius is in|troduced to ha&s;ten his &s;on on board, we could wi&s;h tho&s;e excellent maxims for youth in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the &s;econd act, and which are always omitted in repre&s;entation, were tran&s;po&s;ed to this place, and given per&s;onally by the father to his &s;on; &s;uch a trea&s;ure of u&s;eful in&s;truction &s;hould upon no ac|count
<PB N="39" REF="47">
be lo&s;t to the &s;tage. Polonius's ob&s;erva|tions to Ophelia are prudent, and de&s;criptive of paternal affection.</P>
<P>The remarks of Hamlet and his friends, when entered upon the platform, are very politically thrown by the author upon a far different &s;ubject from what has brought them there; and with the intervention of a flouri&s;h of martial mu&s;ic, u&s;her in the Gho&s;t with as much, or more effect, than at his fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P>The prince's addre&s;s begins with becoming awe, yet we apprehend ri&s;es too &s;uddenly into ex|pre&s;&s;ions ill applied to the venerable, well-known, beloved figure then before him; terror does in|deed confound rea&s;on, but &s;eldom gives birth to a pa&s;&s;ionate, pre&s;umptive effu&s;ion; wherefore we mu&s;t be hardy enough to offer an objection again&s;t the following lines, as to their import:
<Q><L>Be thou a &s;pirit of health, or <HI>goblin damn'd,</HI></L>
<L>Be thy intents <HI>wicked,</HI> or charitable.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nor can we by any means acquie&s;ce in opinion, that a heart &s;o fluttered and affected as Hamlet's is, could po&s;&s;ibly dictate multiplied images; mo&s;t certainly we di&s;cover much more of the poet and fancy than &s;uitable feeling in,
<Q><L>&mdash;tell</L>
<L>Why thy <HI>bones,</HI> hear&s;ed in canonized earth,</L>
<L>Have bur&s;t their &s;earments? Why the &s;epulchre,</L>
<L>Wherein we &s;aw thee quietly interr'd,</L>
<L>Hath op'd its ponderous and marble jaws,</L>
<L>To ca&s;t thee up again?</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="48">Be&s;ides, in the &s;trictne&s;s of ob&s;ervation, it is worthy notice, that Hamlet in one line calls the appearance in view a <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and immediately materializes him, by mentioning the corporeal appurtenance of <HI>bones</HI>; the conclu&s;ion of this &s;cene is admirably compo&s;ed of broken &s;entences; ter|ror, pa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;umed re&s;olution.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding &s;cene, a narration of a very affecting nature is delivered by the Gho&s;t, in lan|guage worthy that inimitable author, who created characters from the force of imagination, and, from the &s;ame inexhau&s;tible &s;ource, furni&s;hed a peculiar mode of expre&s;&s;ion from each.</P>
<P>The Roman catholic opinion of purgatory is inculcated through the whole of this interview; and funeral rites, or preparatives thereto, parti|cularly mentioned in this line:
<Q>Unhou&s;el'd, unanointed, unaneal'd.</Q>
But whether Shake&s;peare may thence be deemed a favourer of popi&s;h principles, remains a matter of much doubt; and the determination, could we come at it, would be of no con&s;equence to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; however, let the religious bent be what it may, we mu&s;t admit the Gho&s;t's &s;timu|lation to revenge furni&s;hes a very gro&s;s idea of immortality, which &s;hould be freed from the pa&s;&s;i|ons and remembrances of clay; nor does the pal|liative di&s;tinction, which forbids any violence again&s;t the Queen, take off the imputation of mortal frailty, hanging about an exi&s;tence merely &s;piritual; an abrupt departure, and tho&s;e beauti|ful lines with which the Gho&s;t di&s;appears, are a
<PB N="41" REF="49">
very happy conclu&s;ion to the &s;cene, which, &s;pun out to a greater length, would have lo&s;t much of its force and beauty.</P>
<P>Hamlet's en&s;uing &s;oliloquy is very natural, and highly expre&s;&s;ive of the impre&s;&s;ions left upon him; his conver&s;ation with Horatio and Marcellus is judiciou&s;ly eva&s;ive, for the circum&s;tance ju&s;t learned of his father's death, does not admit in policy of communication, and if it did, a repeti|tion would pall the audience; however, tho' this &s;cene altogether has the merit of plea&s;ing pro|priety, we can by no means, unle&s;s Hamlet <HI>here</HI> a&s;&s;umes his frenzy, commend the light expre&s;&s;ions to his father's &s;hade&mdash;<HI>Truepenny&mdash;working in the cellarage&mdash;old mole&mdash;worthy pioneer</HI>&mdash;e&s;pecially as he is calling upon his friends, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn, &s;en&s;ible manner, for a promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Thus ends the fir&s;t act, which is &s;o full of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and that of &s;o important a nature, that per|haps no author but Shake&s;peare could have pro|duced any thing after, relative to the &s;ame &s;tory, worthy of attention; yet what follows &s;hews us the po&s;&s;ibility and executive power.</P>
<P>Polonius commences the &s;econd act with Ophe|lia, who, in a very picture&s;que manner, makes her father and the audience acquainted with the prince's di&s;traction, which the &s;ly old &s;tate&s;man imputing to Hamlet's pa&s;&s;ion for his daughter, determines to avail him&s;elf of with the King, as appears by his reading a letter and commenting upon it in the next &s;cene; which, with the Queen's admitting love as a probable cau&s;e of her &s;on's
<PB N="42" REF="50">
phrenzy, determines them to feel his inclination upon that point. Polonius, like a bu&s;y, u&s;eful courtier, undertakes this, and encounters Hamlet, who&s;e pretence of not knowing him, occa&s;ions much pointed &s;atire, and &s;everal agreeable repar|tees; from whence, Polonius, not being able to deduce any thing u&s;eful, retires, and makes way for two other court-&s;pies, who, under a veil of friend&s;hip, endeavour to worm out the &s;ecret; but he evades their de&s;ign in a different and more ma&s;terly manner; there could not be a more pregnant, rich, and philo&s;ophical di&s;&s;ertation upon the mode of his own mind, and the excellence of human nature, than the following elegant piece of poetical pro&s;e delivered by Hamlet:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lo&s;t all mirth; foregone all cu&s;tom of exerci&s;e, and indeed it goes &s;o heavily with my di&s;po&s;ition, that this goodly frame, the earth, &s;eems to me a &s;teril promontary; this mo&s;t excellent canopy, the air, this maje&s;tical roof, fretted with golden fire; why it appears to me nothing but a foul and pe&s;tilential congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is man? how noble in rea&s;on! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how expre&s;s and admirable! in action, how like an angel! in apprehen&s;ion, how like a God! the beauty of the world! the Paragon of animals!"</Q></P>
<P>In the foregoing pa&s;&s;age we have as conci&s;e and beautiful a delineation of human nature as thought can conceive, or words expre&s;s; and the imme|diate
<PB N="43" REF="51">
tran&s;ition to mention of the players, who, tho' &s;eemingly intruders, are material agents for the plot, is excellently contrived by the author; &s;ince Hamlet, as we may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e from his proceedings, immediately &s;ugge&s;ts that u&s;e for the Actors in their profe&s;&s;ion, which &s;oon after he makes of them.</P>
<P>When Polonius enters to tell him of the come|dians, the Prince again a&s;&s;umes his &s;tile of equi|vocal repartee, and indeed is plea&s;ingly witty with the verbo&s;e old &s;tate&s;man; his welcome to the players is well adapted to the mode of behaviour he has put on; but his hint to the lady of her voice

is not commendably de|licate; requiring a ta&s;te of their quality, and making a mi&s;take in the fir&s;t line of that pa&s;&s;age he points out re&s;pecting Pyrrhus, are plea&s;ing and natural circum&s;tances, though of the minute kind.</P>
<P>From the imagery of tho&s;e &s;peeches which the player repeats, it appears plainly that they, and the &s;cene in the third act, are not only intended as preparatory means to convict the King of guilt, but are al&s;o meant to realize the characters of the main action; therefore the matter, manner, and action, are evidently propo&s;ed as a contra&s;t of fiction to what it is nece&s;&s;ary the audience &s;hould think truth.</P>
<P>There is no &s;entiment in the whole character of Hamlet, nor indeed any other more worthy a good heart and great mind, than his reply to Po|lonius, who &s;ays, he

<P>At the beginning of the &s;oliloquy which con|cludes the &s;econd act, Hamlet gives him&s;elf addi|tional force and reality, by alluding to the player's fictitious feelings, compared with his own &s;ub&s;tan|tial cau&s;e of grief; the de&s;ign of rou&s;ing con&s;cious guilt in his uncle, by a repre&s;entation &s;imilar to the murder of his Father, is politic and well in|troduced; for a million of in&s;tances furni&s;h indu|bitable proof
<Q><L>That murder, tho' it have no tongue, will &s;peak</L>
<L>With mo&s;t miraculous organ.</L></Q>
His remarks that the &s;pirit he has &s;een may be a devil, and that the devil may have power to a&s;|&s;ume a plea&s;ing &s;hape, &s;avour very &s;trongly of a weak, &s;uper&s;titious mind, and give us no exalted idea of the prince's head, however favourably we judge of his heart.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;cene of the third act, we find the King eager to get the cau&s;e of his Nephew's &s;up|po&s;ed frenzy; the play being mentioned, and an invitation for the court to &s;ee it, his Maje&s;ty, from political rea&s;ons, agrees; and Ophelia is left to try what explanation &s;he can bring her lover to&mdash;the celebrated &s;oliloquy&mdash;<HI>to be, or not to be</HI>&mdash;is he e introduced, and exhibits a beautiful chain of moral rea&s;oning; the objection thrown in again&s;t &s;uicide,
<Q>&mdash;The dread of &s;omething after death,</Q>
is conci&s;e, per&s;ua&s;ive, and highly con&s;onant with
<PB N="45" REF="53">
the true principles of moral philo&s;ophy; critics have, with ju&s;tice, pointed out the incon&s;i&s;tence of that parenthe&s;is, which &s;tiles the future world
<Q><L>An undi&s;cover'd country, from who&s;e bourne</L>
<L>No traveller returns.</L></Q>
Notwith&s;tanding the ma&s;ter-&s;pring of this very play is &s;uch a traveller; therefore a palpable, flat contradiction to the above a&s;&s;ertion; the author no doubt meant a corporeal traveller, but it is &s;tretching indulgence very far to admit &s;uch a latitude of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation between Hamlet and Ophelia is finely imagined to puzzle the &s;pies who watch his words and actions; and tho' it exhibits mad|ne&s;s, yet as Polonius remarks of a former &s;cene&mdash; <HI>there is method in it.</HI> Shake&s;peare, in all his pieces, &s;eems to have had great regard to the capital cha|racters, both as to &s;trength and variety; the feigned madne&s;s in this piece tends greatly to the latter, and gives much &s;cope, particularly in this &s;cene, for powerful action&mdash;the King's propo&s;i|tion of &s;ending the prince to England, though a &s;trange &s;cheme, &s;hews the apprehen&s;ion which con|&s;cious guilt fixes on his mind.</P>
<P>Hamlet's advice to the players is as ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible a lecture upon &s;everal theatrical excellen|cies and errors, as ever was penned; but few who perform the part have a right to deliver it, being in many in&s;tances guilty them&s;elves of tho&s;e very ab&s;urdities which they recommend a reformation of.</P>
<P>Hamlet's behaviour in the &s;cene of the play is extremely characteri&s;tic; his &s;portive replies to
<PB N="46" REF="54">
Ophelia, and his &s;atirical taunts to the King, &s;uit the &s;tate of things happily; indeed the mock re|pre&s;entation, and every other circum&s;tance, are very well conducted towards the grand point; and his maje&s;ty's abrupt retreat &s;ufficiently evin|ces his guilt; the en&s;uing convention with Ro|&s;encraus and Guilden&s;tern, plainly &s;hews the ju&s;t opinion Hamlet entertains of court &s;ycophants, and his playing upon Polonius is plea&s;ant, as well as poignant.</P>
<P>The King's &s;oliloquy is a mo&s;t fini&s;hed piece of argumentative, pathetic contrition, and furni&s;hes a very in&s;tructive picture of a guilty mind; of Hamlet's, which immediately &s;ucceeds, we can|not &s;peak favourably, as it greatly derogates not only from an amiable, but even a common moral character.</P>
<P>Revenge, when mo&s;t provoked, rather vio|lates human feelings; however, as in &s;ome in|&s;tances, the heart cannot decline it, and what more provoking than the death of a father? yet life for life is the utmo&s;t that can be required; for a mor|tal vice, or failing, premeditately to plunge the perpetrator into a &s;tate of infinite mi&s;ery, had we power, would be giving nature a diabolical bent; therefore, when Hamlet re&s;olves upon taking his uncle in &s;ome peculiar act of &s;in, that his heels may kick at heaven, he certainly forms a de&s;ign, and utters &s;entiments more &s;uitable to an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the ba&s;e&s;t kind, than a virtuous prince and a feeling man.</P>
<P>In that excellent &s;cene of the clo&s;et, where the Prince &s;o beautifully and &s;o powerfully remon|&s;trates
<PB N="47" REF="55">
to his mother upon her guilty and &s;hameful &s;ituation, there appears an incident which rather ca&s;ts another &s;hade upon our hero's character, that is the death of Polonius; it happens evi|dently through a mi&s;take, &s;uppo&s;ing him the King; yet when the mi&s;take is di&s;covered, he has not common humanity enough to regret taking the life of an innocent, inoffen&s;ive old man, nay the father of a lady too for whom he profe&s;&s;es a regard; but by the following lines &s;eems to hold the matter light:
<Q><L>Thou wretched, ra&s;h, intruding fool, farewel,</L>
<L>I took thee for thy betters, take thy fortune;</L>
<L>Thou find'&s;t to be too bu&s;y is &s;ome danger.</L></Q>
In the conclu&s;ive &s;peech of the act, it is true he &s;eems to feel, but we apprehend too &s;lightly; and making him&s;elf the vindictive mini&s;ter of heaven, is arraigning providence, for influencing puni&s;h|ment where no guilt has appeared; by the &s;ame mode of argument every ra&s;h, or bad man, may palliate the mo&s;t inordinate actions.</P>
<P>Indeed why Polonius &s;hould be killed, in flat contradiction to every degree of poetical ju&s;tice, is rather my&s;terious; if meant merely as a cau&s;e for Laertes's re&s;entment, and Ophelia's madne&s;s, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert that both might have been brought about on a better principle, as will appear from &s;ome general &s;trictures on the plot.</P>
<P>The Gho&s;t's appearance gives great force to, and rai&s;es a very beautiful climax of pa&s;&s;ion in this &s;cene; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to form an idea of any thing better calculated for actors to &s;trike, or an audience to feel in; the circum&s;tances and ex|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="48" REF="56">
are &s;o highly de&s;erving of each other, that the performance mu&s;t be languid indeed, and feelings totally benumbed, if both eyes and hearts are not much intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>The King's re&s;olution of &s;ending Hamlet to England &s;eems ju&s;tly precipitated by the unju&s;ti|fiable event of Polonius's death; the &s;cene in which the King enquires for the body, contains &s;ome pointed expre&s;&s;ions, and the Prince's depar|ture is of that unaffecting nature, that we doubt whether one &s;pectator out of a thou&s;and ever &s;aid I hope he will come again, though from &s;uch a voyage &s;o late in the piece it &s;eems very doubtful.</P>
<P>Ophelia's di&s;traction is an extreme pretty varia|tion of action, and is de&s;cribed with a forceable delicacy, worthy of Shake&s;peare's pen; Laertes is u&s;hered in with a &s;trange in&s;inuation, importing no le&s;s than a propo&s;ition to chu&s;e him King; how this became nece&s;&s;ary, or is reconcileable, we cannot &s;ee, as in a preceding &s;cene, the King &s;ays, that he cannot enforce any law again&s;t Hamlet on account of the murder committed, becau&s;e
<Q><L>He's loved of the di&s;tracted multitude,</L>
<L>Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;</L>
<L>And where 'tis &s;o, th' offender's &s;courge is weigh'd,</L>
<L>But never the offence.</L></Q></P>
<P>Nay &s;peaking of the matter afterwards to Laer|tes, the King delivers him&s;elf thus:
<Q><L>Why to a public court I might not go,</L>
<L>Is the great love the people bear him;</L>
<L>Who dipping all his faults in their affection,</L>
<L>Would, like the &s;pring that turneth wood to &s;tone,</L>
<L>Convert his gyves to graces.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="57">Now if Hamlet was &s;o extremely popular, how is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that Laertes, by complain|ing of a private injury, &s;hould &s;uper&s;ede him in the people's favour, and gain their voices to the prejudice of his birth-right; be&s;ides Laertes's at|tack upon, and language to a monarch, without knowing a &s;yllable of the matter he contends about, makes him an ab&s;olute Drawcan&s;ir, equally the foe of ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, and decorum; indeed the author &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this, making the king &s;ay
<Q><L>Will you, in revenge of your dear father's death,</L>
<L>De&s;troy both friends and foes?</L></Q></P>
<P>Ophelia's &s;econd introduction relieves and gives &s;ome &s;parks of life to a conver&s;ation full of fal&s;e fire and impotence, wherein one party appears a blu&s;tering fool, and the other a da&s;tard villain; as to the con&s;piracy again&s;t Hamlet's life, it &s;eems the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of a forced cata&s;trophe; a plan which, by approving it, &s;hews Laertes to be as much an intentional murderer as the king.</P>
<P>There is a degree of dete&s;tation mingled with contempt, and that di&s;agreeble feeling both the&s;e characters rai&s;e; the Queen's account of Ophelia's mournful end is ju&s;tly admired; and tho' the lady, while in her &s;en&s;es, &s;aid very little to affect us, yet here the poet teaches us to feel for the event which has deprived her of life.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Voltaire's objections to the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fifth act, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with the dignity and decorum of tragedy, are in a great mea&s;ure true, yet the characters are &s;o finely
<PB N="50" REF="58">
drawn, &s;uch pointed &s;atire, and &s;uch in&s;tructive moral &s;entiments ari&s;e, as give it great e&s;timation, and rai&s;e it far above in&s;ipid propriety; &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions of the grave-digger, in an&s;wer to Hamlet's que&s;tion, how long a corp&s;e will be in the ground before it rots, however true, are offen&s;ively indelicate.</P>
<P>The funeral of Ophelia is indeed a maimed, and to me, an irreconcilable piece of work. She is we find allowed Chri&s;tian burial, is attended by the king, queen, and whole court, yet the clergy|man refu&s;es funeral &s;ervice, &s;uppo&s;ing her death doubtful, tho' the queen in the foregoing act im|putes it, without re&s;ervation, to an accident; and we venture to pre&s;ume there is no medium be|tween admi&s;&s;ion to con&s;ecrated ground, with all u&s;ual ceremonies, and a total exclu&s;ion from the whole; but the author &s;eems to have been in a &s;tate of difficulty;&mdash;he would have a grave, and made the be&s;t apology for it he could.</P>
<P>The encounter of Hamlet and Laertes is &s;up|ported with an exce&s;s of &s;pirit on both &s;ides; and, if we con&s;ider the real &s;tate of things, rather blame|ably on the part of the former; he has killed the father, and in con&s;equence deprived the &s;i&s;ter of her &s;en&s;es; yet, when a grieving, injured bro|ther and &s;on, vents an explanation, very excu&s;able in his &s;ituation; the prince, even at the interment of a woman he pretends love for, indulges a mo&s;t outrageous degree of pa&s;&s;ion, interrupts a &s;acred ceremony, and offers his le&s;&s;on in &s;tile of a chal|lenge to Laertes; nay, after mo&s;t in&s;ulting beha|viour,
<PB N="51" REF="59">
when &s;eparated&mdash;he retorts accu&s;ation upon the challenged per&s;on in the following irri|tative taunt:
<Q><L>Hear you, Sir,</L>
<L>What is the rea&s;on you abu&s;e me thus?</L>
<L>I lov'd you ever&mdash;but 'tis no matter;</L>
<L>Let Hercules him&s;elf do what he may,</L>
<L>The cat will mew, the dog will have his day.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is indeed a palliative excu&s;e made by Hamlet to Laertes, for this incon&s;i&s;tent behaviour at the beginning of the la&s;t &s;cene&mdash;where he &s;ays;
<Q><L>&mdash;This pre&s;ence knows,</L>
<L>And you mu&s;t needs have heard, how I am puni&s;h'd</L>
<L>With a &s;ore <HI>di&s;traction</HI>; what I have done,</L>
<L>That might your nature, honour, and exception</L>
<L>Roughly awake, I here proclaim was <HI>madne&s;s.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Now if it be con&s;idered, that this madne&s;s has been but <HI>a&s;&s;umed,</HI> this appears a mean prevarica|tion to a man whom he has mo&s;t deeply injured, and who, to his knowledge, never meant him wrong; to &s;ay that this pa&s;&s;ion was put on to de|ceive the court, weighs but little, as we find in the action, di&s;hevelled hair, ungartered &s;tockings, &amp;c. are laid a&s;ide for a compo&s;ed appearance; and immediately after the blu&s;ter we perceive him not only regular in conver&s;ation with a coxcomb me&s;&s;enger of the king's, but punctual in the terms of the challenge, and coolly &s;en&s;ible in fulfilling it <HI>before the court,</HI> without any de&s;ign more than the credit of victory in view.</P>
<P>Another faint apology is made in a &s;cene with Horatio, where the prince &s;eems to be &s;orry that the <HI>bravery</HI> of Laertes's grief &s;hould &s;o far pro|voke
<PB N="52" REF="60">
him; but all this &s;cene, except a very few lines, is left out in the repre&s;entation; and indeed, tho' meant to account for Hamlet's coming back, it draws &s;uch a &s;trange picture of his getting at the kind's di&s;patches, and forging others, to turn the de&s;ign of his death upon Ro&s;encraus and Guil|den&s;tern, that we may lament &s;uch low chicanery in a character of dignity; one who had no occa|&s;ion, but much to the contrary, to appear a volun|teer in his uncle's propo&s;ition of &s;ending him to England; however, as the tran&s;action of his &s;peedy return &s;hould be accounted for, we wi&s;h &s;omewhat more like a narrative was pre&s;erved in action.</P>
<P>O&s;trick is a whim&s;ical mu&s;hroom of fancy, and tho' Shake&s;peare pre&s;ents his audience with a Dani&s;h beau, he took the con&s;tituent parts from Engli&s;h court-butterflies of his days, and even furni&s;hes him with the equivocal punning &s;tile which took its ri&s;e and fa&s;hion from that &s;econd Solomon, James the fir&s;t, who&s;e pedantry, and hatred of witches, were equally con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;cene, if there are two good fencers, (which by the bye &s;eldom happens) mu&s;t plea&s;e the eye con&s;iderably; yet &s;uch a &s;laughter of cha|racters mu&s;t cloy the mo&s;t &s;anguine critic that ever thir&s;ted for theatrical blood-&s;hed, and pity mu&s;t extend very far indeed, to attend even the expiring hero of this piece with any degree of patience.</P>
<P>Having thus progre&s;&s;ively delineated the plan, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome general &s;tric|tures upon the whole, to ju&s;tify tho&s;e occa&s;ional remarks which have been made.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="61">At the opening of the play, we find that a very remarkable apparition has been &s;een by the palace-guard two nights together; yet &s;o re&s;olute and &s;ecret have the&s;e &s;oldiers been that no mention is made of it, except to Horatio, who di&s;believes the &s;tory; but on his watch the third night, is con|vinced by ocular demon&s;tration; upon which he very naturally determines to mention it to Hamlet in particular, as &s;eemingly mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the appearance; this, in conjunction with Bernardo and Marcellus, he does the next morning; here it &s;eems a little irreconcileable, that Horatio, the par|ticular and intimate friend of the prince, &s;hould be in El&s;ineur two days, or more, as we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e from circum&s;tances, before he paid re&s;pects to his royal patron; the&s;e, we confe&s;s, are minu|tiae, yet claim notice in the &s;trictne&s;s of critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Hamlet's a&s;&s;umed madne&s;s might undoubtedly have been made the in&s;trument of &s;ome important &s;ecret purpo&s;e relative to his father's murder, and his own ju&s;t re&s;entment; yet, as it now appears, an&s;wers no other end than merely cajoling the King, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Queen and Ophelia, bam|ming Polonius and the courtiers, and giving great &s;cope for capital acting; which la&s;t article &s;eems much more the author's intention through this piece, than decorum and con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The King not being able, either by his &s;pies, or even conde&s;cending to be a li&s;tener him&s;elf, to find out the bottom of this frenzy, which, through con&s;cious guilt, to him looks terrible, forms a re|&s;olution of &s;ending Hamlet to England, under
<PB N="54" REF="62">
pretence of receiving tribute; but, as appears afterwards, that the complai&s;ant Engli&s;h monarch &s;hould put to death the heir of the Dani&s;h crown upon mere reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Strange! that he who found means to de&s;troy his own brother, in the plenitude of power and popular e&s;teem, &s;hould take &s;uch a round-about method to di&s;po&s;e of a nephew he &s;eems to fear; and full as &s;trange is it, that Hamlet, who has &s;o much cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his uncle's intention, and who has &s;uch powerful motives for &s;taying at home, &s;hould tamely, without objection, go upon the voyage.</P>
<P>On returning, we do not find him taking any &s;tep towards puni&s;hing the murderer; nay, mo&s;t politely undertakes to win a wager for him; how unworthily for him then does the cata&s;trophe come about! when wounded with a poi&s;oned weapon him&s;elf, when he hears of his mother's being poi&s;oned, then and not before, urged by de&s;peration, not ju&s;t revenge, he demoli&s;hes the king of &s;hreds and patches, as he properly &s;tiles his uncle in the third act.</P>
<P>From this view it is with all deference appre|hended, that, after his detection at the play, if his maje&s;ty, upon the principle of &s;elf-defence, had formed a de&s;ign of taking the prince off by in&s;tru|ments at home; if that de&s;ign had been made known to the Queen; had &s;he, through maternal affection, put Hamlet on his guard; and had that prince taken mea&s;ures worthy the motives of &s;ti|mulation, a tyrant of &s;ome con&s;equence and uni|formity
<PB N="53" REF="63">
would have been &s;hewn in Claudius; a tender mother in the Queen, and a hero in Hamlet: the innocent characters, Polonius and Ophelia, might have been &s;aved; and death prevented from &s;talking, without limitation, at the cata&s;trophe: as it &s;tands, no le&s;s than eight of the characters are di&s;po&s;ed of that way, four in view at one time upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of characters, we are to lament that the hero, who is intended as amiable, &s;hould be &s;uch an apparent heap of incon&s;i&s;tency; impe|tuous, tho' philo&s;ophical; &s;en&s;ible of injury, yet timid of re&s;entment; &s;hrewd, yet void of policy; full of filial piety, yet tame under oppre&s;&s;ion; boa&s;tful in expre&s;&s;ion, undetermined in action; and yet, from being pregnant with great variety, from affording many opportunities to exert &s;ound judgment and exten&s;ive powers, he is as agreeable and &s;triking an object as any in the Engli&s;h drama.</P>
<P>In the performance of this character we mu&s;t, as in RICHARD, place Mr. GARRICK far before any other competitor; his reception of, and ad|dre&s;s to the Gho&s;t; his natural, picture&s;que atti|tude, terror-&s;truck features, low, tremulous ex|pre&s;&s;ion, ri&s;ing in harmonious gradation, with the climax of his &s;peech and feeling, all give us the mo&s;t plea&s;ing, we had almo&s;t &s;aid, a&s;toni&s;hing &s;en&s;ibility; in all the pointed parts of the dialogue his matchle&s;s eyes anticipate his tongue, and im|pre&s;s the meaning upon us with double force; no man ever did, nor po&s;&s;ibly ever will, &s;peak he|mi&s;tics, broken &s;entences, and make tran&s;itions with &s;uch penetrating effect; in this lies the in|di&s;putable

&s;uperiority of our modern Ro&s;cius; that where other performers, and good ones too, pa&s;s unnoticed, he is frequently great; where an author is languid, he gives him &s;pirit; where powerful, due &s;upport; out of many in&s;tances we &s;hall &s;elect only two: Fir&s;t, where Hamlet &s;ays to his interpo&s;ing friends&mdash;<HI>I &s;ay, away</HI>&mdash;then turning to the Gho&s;t&mdash;<HI>Go on&mdash;I'll follow.</HI>&mdash;His variation from extreme pa&s;&s;ion to reverential awe, is &s;o forceably expre&s;&s;ed in eyes, features, attitude, and voice, that every heart mu&s;t feel; the &s;econd is in the third act, where the Queen &s;ays, the Gho&s;t is but <HI>the coinage of his brain</HI>; his turning &s;hort from looking after the apparition with wild|ne&s;s of terror, and viewing his mother with pathe|tic concern, is mo&s;t happily executed.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY gave con&s;iderable plea&s;ure in Ham|let, which was, however, chiefly derived from a fine figure and mu&s;ical voice; but declamation and originality were wanting.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN, under the di&s;advantage of a moderate per&s;on, and &s;till more moderate voice, by the effects of &s;ound judgment undoubtedly &s;tands &s;econd; in the lighter &s;cenes, he wants, it is true, ea&s;e and levity; but in the &s;oliloquies, and the third act clo&s;et &s;cene, he is, or has been, truly excellent.</P>
<P>Mr. ROSS has the ea&s;e of a gentleman and dig|nity of a prince, but wants weight for the decla|mation, poignancy of expre&s;&s;ion for the &s;pirited parts, and variation of countenance for the vehe|ment pa&s;&s;ions; however, he might ju&s;tly gain more critical applau&s;e if he would forget the au|dience,

<P>The whole part of the King, except his &s;olilo|quy, is truly wretched for an actor; and, to &s;ay the truth, we never &s;aw one who did not make a very in&s;ipid figure in it, the late Mr. SPARKS ex|cepted; he was great in the forementioned &s;olilo|quy, re&s;pectable in every pa&s;&s;age of the lea&s;t re|gard, and &s;o peculiarly happy in falling, when &s;tabbed from the throne, that we may truly &s;ay, a good end apologized for a very bad character.</P>
<P>Polonius is drawn with &s;ome tint of the whim&s;i|cal, yet we cannot &s;uppo&s;e him meant for that laughing-&s;tock, that buffoon of Tragedy, he is generally repre&s;ented; wherefore we mu&s;t be bold to a&s;&s;ert that Mr. MACKLIN, who, while his capabilities la&s;ted, &s;hould never have been &s;epara|ted from the &s;tage, was far the be&s;t of many we have &s;een; he &s;hewed oddity, grafted upon the man of &s;en&s;e, and, as we remember, retained mo&s;t of that &s;cene at the beginning of the &s;econd act, which good &s;en&s;e, and Shake&s;peare's friends, mu&s;t lament the general omi&s;&s;ion of.&mdash;Mr. SHUTER, whom nature conceived and brought forth in a fit of laughter, may mean extremely well, but in this character, his literally happy countenance plays rather again&s;t him.

<P>Laertes is a character no way remarkable, un|le&s;s as contributing to the cata&s;trophe; unle&s;s by
<PB N="58" REF="66">
joining in, and executing, a villainous device for the de&s;truction of Hamlet; Mr. LEE, who&s;e abi|lities &s;trengthened many &s;econd and third parts, while they marred principals, made more of Laertes con&s;iderably than any other performer has done for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>The Gho&s;t is mo&s;t admirably written; and ac|cording to the idea we form of &s;upernatural utter|ance, adapted to &s;upernatural appearance. Mr. QUIN has never been excelled, nor by many de|grees equalled; &s;olemnity of expre&s;&s;ion was his excellence in tragedy, and, if we may be allowed the remark, his fault. Tho' not directly to our purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent, we cannot help ob&s;erving that Shake&s;peare's fame, as an actor, was di&s;puted only becau&s;e he wrote, as plainly appears from the mode of &s;peaking Mr. GARRICK, by mo&s;t excellent example, has e&s;tabli&s;hed; he certainly, as a judge and lover of nature, de&s;pi&s;ed the titum-ti, mono|tonous &s;ing-&s;ong, then fa&s;hionable, and indeed equally admired, till within le&s;s than the&s;e la&s;t thirty years; for this rea&s;on, he was judged to be but a middling performer, except in the Gho&s;t; and there, with propriety, no doubt, he a&s;&s;umed pompo&s;ity, which, on other occa&s;ions, le&s;s com|mendable, would have rendered him a very popu|lar actor. Want of action in the Gho&s;t throws a damp on the narration; if a &s;pirit can a&s;&s;ume corporeal appearance, there can be no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e imaginary arms motionle&s;s, no more than imaginary legs; however, &s;ome peculiarity in this point, as well as the tones of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="67">Horatio is the only amiable man in the piece, yet, except his fir&s;t &s;cene, is very incon&s;iderable; what could be made of &s;uch a character, Mr. HAVARD &s;hewed in full; and it would be wrong|ing Mr. HULL's &s;en&s;ibility, for &s;uch feelings as actuate Hamlet's friend, not to acknowledge he does him great ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The grave-digger was never in better pre&s;erva|tion than with Mr. YATES. The Queen &s;hould be an object of dete&s;tation, or pity, yet is neither, but an odd compound of both. Mrs. PRITCHARD here, as in many others much more intere&s;ting&mdash; when &s;hall we <HI>&s;ee her like again.</HI> Ophelia found a great friend in Mrs. CIBBER, and has no rea&s;on to complain of her intimacy with Mi&s;s MACKLiN.</P>
<P>As to the ver&s;ification and dialogue of this piece, they are flowing without monotony, poetical with|out bomba&s;t, ea&s;y without flatne&s;s, and always &s;peak to the heart, where there is opportunity or occa&s;ion. To tran&s;cribe all the beautiful pa&s;&s;ages would &s;eem a de&s;ign to fill up, and to produce only few, where there is abundance, mu&s;t be deemed partiality; wherefore we refer to the reader's ta&s;te and the piece it&s;elf, pre&s;uming to conclude our remarks on it with one general ob|&s;ervation, which is, that no play can afford more entertainment on the &s;tage, or improvement in the clo&s;et, tho' abounding with &s;uperfluities and incon&s;i&s;tencies; &s;everal of the former are omitted in performance, mo&s;t of the latter mu&s;t remain; all the moral we can deduce is, that murder can|not lie hid, and that con&s;cience ever makes a coward of guilt.</P>

<HEAD>THE RECRUITING OFFICER. A COMEDY. By FARQUHAR.</HEAD>
<P>THE opening of this comedy is peculiar in two re&s;pects; fir&s;t, as no other begins in the &s;ame manner, and next, as its title is verified in the fir&s;t &s;cene; there is one e&s;&s;ential towards drawing cha|racters in a ma&s;terly manner, a &s;trict intimacy with, and a thorough knowledge of the &s;tation of life repre&s;ented; this requi&s;ite Mr. Farquhar thorough|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the piece under con&s;ideration; the military life he not only liked, but was him&s;elf immediately connected with; therefore we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e his portraits drawn from &s;triking likene&s;&s;es, and are highly fini&s;hed; however, as examination will prove this point, either for or again&s;t the author, better than &s;uppo&s;ition, let us proceed to a candid trial.</P>
<P>The character of a good recruiting &s;erjeant is as complicate for low policy, or more &s;o, than any other; he mu&s;t have &s;moothne&s;s and volubility of tongue, &s;eeming genero&s;ity, profe&s;&s;ed good-nature, pliable compliance to flatter different tempers, unblu&s;hing confidence, unbounded lies, a &s;till con&s;cience, and an unfeeling heart; the&s;e qualifi|cations mu&s;t be the te&s;t of Kite's character.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;peech of this non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer to the mob, is a ma&s;terly piece of military elocu|tion; it touches with &s;trong propriety upon tho&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="69">
points mo&s;t likely to impre&s;s the &s;imple, the idle, and the di&s;&s;olute; introducing him&s;elf to Co&s;tar Permain, by offering his cap to try on, and the countryman's apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch an experiment are highly in character; the &s;erjeant's account of the bed of honour, the recruit's di&s;gu&s;t at being &s;aluted by the title of brother, and his being &s;oothed into good humour by &s;ome compliments thrown out upon the importance of his figure, render this &s;cene highly plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Captain Plume is well introduced, as hearing his own drum; but he appears to have a &s;trange idea of &s;mart riding and expedition, when he &s;peaks of one hundred and twenty miles in thirty hours; in the en&s;uing &s;cene, Kite pre&s;erves his character of humour, and throws out &s;ome excellent &s;trokes in mentioning the recruits he has picked up; one in particular conveys ju&s;t &s;atire, tho' perhaps not ge|nerally under&s;tood; &s;peaking of a Wel&s;h par&s;on he has enli&s;ted, the captain a&s;ks, <Q REND="inline">"Can he write?"</Q> to which Kite replies,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hum&mdash;he plays rarely upon the fiddle;</Q>
this alludes to a &s;candalous circum&s;tance then common, and we fear now to be met with too often among curates in Wales; we mean &s;tipends &s;o low as ten pounds a year, which occa&s;ioned many to work as day labourers; but the mo&s;t u&s;ual method of eking out &s;uch pitiful allowances was to keep hedge-alehou&s;es, and every &s;unday-afternoon, in particular, to amu&s;e their pari&s;hioners with &s;ome tunes on the fiddle: the circum&s;tance of Mrs. Molly at the Ca&s;tle, &s;eems to have no connection with the piece, except to
<PB N="62" REF="70">
&s;how &s;ome part of Plume's character, and to give a hint of the &s;hadows which frequently fill up military mu&s;ter-rolls.</P>
<P>Worthy, who&s;e name is no otherwi&s;e exempli|fied in his character, than as a tame, and we may add, a &s;imple lover, opens the important &s;ecret of his being in love; and Plume, with much plea|&s;antry, rallies the romantic &s;wain, throwing out &s;ome u&s;eful ob&s;ervations upon love policy; but whatever ju&s;tice there may be in the following piece of advice, it is very unbecoming the due re|&s;erve of a &s;tage; the captain, &s;peaking of what he would do to win a coy mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;peaks thus
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the very fir&s;t thing that I would do, &s;hould be to lie with her chambermaid, and hire three or four wenches in the neighbourhood to report I had got them with child;"</Q>
nor is a pa&s;&s;age &s;ome lines after more ju&s;tifiable, where mentioning Sylvia, the honourable captain declares he would have debauched her if he could, and continues&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;he was a pert, ob&s;tinate fool, and would lo&s;e her maidenhead her own way."</Q>
The anecdote of Sylvia's &s;ending ten guineas to Mrs. Molly does credit to her feelings, and places her in e&s;teem of the audience before &s;he makes her appearance.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene the ladies are very well con|tra&s;ted, Melinda's affectation of refined notions is very genteelly repul&s;ed by Sylvia, who plea&s;ingly blends good &s;en&s;e with vivacity; if any double entendre is allowable, the following would cer|tainly appear &s;o, but for the lu&s;cious intimation of theatric expre&s;&s;ion, and the gro&s;s enforcement of Melinda's reply&mdash;Sylvia &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I can do every
<PB N="63" REF="71">
thing with my father but drink, and &s;hoot fly|ing; and I am &s;ure I can do every thing my mother could, were I put to the tryal;"</Q>
&mdash;to this her friend, without much delicacy, rejoins
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are in a fair way of being put to it, for I am told your captain is come to town."</Q>
Another pa&s;&s;age in Melinda's part of this &s;cene is to me highly cen&s;urable; to Sylvia's declaration of being tired of her &s;ex, the expective lady replies,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you are tired of an appendix to our &s;ex, that you can't &s;o hand&s;omely get rid of in petticoats, as if you were in breeches"</Q>
&mdash;the &s;ucceeding alterca|tion between the female friends is extremely well devi&s;ed, and &s;upported with much vivacity&mdash;the retorts ari&s;e naturally from each other, and run into pit-pat dialogue, which, adequately perform|ed, cannot fail to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Sylvia's retreat is well timed to prevent exce&s;s, but a remark of Lucy's after &s;he goes off is in|famou&s;ly gro&s;s. Melinda propo&s;es this que&s;tion,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"did you not &s;ee the proud nothing how &s;he &s;welled upon the arrival of her fellow?"</Q>
to which &s;he receives the following an&s;wer from her maid, who &s;eems replete with the &s;ame ideas as her delicate mi&s;tre&s;s:
<Q REND="inline">"her fellow has not been here long enough to occa&s;ion any great &s;wel|ling;"</Q>
yet this, and the other exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages I have pointed out, might be very ea&s;ily &s;oftened, or if entirely omitted, would be no lo&s;s in point of wit or humour.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice Ballance, who opens the &s;econd act with Plume, &s;peaks in the true Engli&s;h &s;tile, for it is certain that the people of this i&s;land, in general,
<PB N="64" REF="72">
bear the taxes, occa&s;ioned by war, with great &s;pirit, when their fleets and armies furni&s;h the news-papers with a violent effu&s;ion of blood, which &s;ome may interpret as a mark of national inhumanity, but rather appears to be the effect of a noble &s;pirit, which pants for &s;uperiority in the fields of fame, and &s;acrifices weaker feelings to principles of glory.</P>
<P>Plume's frequent mention of Sylvia interrupts the ju&s;tice's political bent plea&s;ingly; and when Ballance &s;peaks of a di&s;honourable de&s;ign upon Sylvia, as no more than &s;imilar to what he once had him&s;elf on a country gentleman's daughter; the captain's di&s;tinction between a friend and a &s;tranger &s;hews gratitude with delicacy of prin|ciple, but flatly contradicts his declaration to Worthy, already noted, which avows the de&s;ign he here di&s;claims.</P>
<P>Sylvia is well introduced, and the ju&s;tice called upon conveniently to leave her with Plume; their encounter is polite and delicate; but tho' the author &s;eems to have meant a refined compliment in the circum&s;tance of the captain's will, we can|not con&s;ider it as any other than a very &s;u&s;picious one: had it been &s;ent to her on the eve of the battle, provi&s;ionally, it would have been what &s;he calls it; but to be the bearer of it him&s;elf, to make per&s;onal mention, takes off much of the obligation. The lady's hint, of his little boy at the ca&s;tle, is arch and plea&s;ant, and Plume's fol|lowing confu&s;ion very natural.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice Ballance, after &s;peaking of his &s;on's death, addre&s;&s;es his daughter with much inten|tional
<PB N="65" REF="73">
affection, and prudent propriety; intimating, that as her fortune is increa&s;ed, from fifteen hun|dred pounds only, to twelve hundred a year e&s;tate, he expects her views &s;hould be more extended; and de&s;ires her to think no more of captain Plume. When we &s;ay that the ju&s;tice here &s;peaks with propriety, we only mean as a man of the world, for it is plain that the vanity of family connections chiefly influences him, which many a father ere now has mi&s;taken for happine&s;s; be&s;ides, if, as he &s;ays, he could like Plume as a mere &s;on-in-law, to receive fifteen hundred pounds portion, it is mean and mercenary to think him unworthy the &s;ame lady with twenty thou&s;and; nor can we conceive what idea he mu&s;t have of his daughter's mind, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he could from &s;uch principles &s;hake off regard for a man &s;he has entertained upon favourable terms&mdash;the favour a&s;ked, that Sylvia will never marry without his con&s;ent, and his promi&s;e never to di&s;po&s;e of her without her own, are &s;trokes which give agreeable &s;en&s;ations to a feeling mind.</P>
<P>Melinda's letter, which &s;he hints at the end of the fir&s;t act, &s;tarts &s;ome motives of perplexity, by alarming the ju&s;tice with apprehen&s;ions of Plume's de&s;ign upon his daughter, and the old gentleman's &s;entiments, in con&s;equence of it, are very &s;pirited; but we apprehend there are two intru&s;ions upon decorum in the &s;cene with Worthy; fir&s;t, Bal|lance's charging him with privacy to Plume's di&s;honourable intentions, and then refu&s;ing his author, which is cruelty to an innocent per&s;on; nor does it appear from the letter that he is en|joined
<PB N="66" REF="74">
&s;ecrecy; next Worthy's de&s;cending to &s;uch a pitiful di&s;covery as picking up a bit of a torn letter; undoubtedly if a man of &s;pirit heard an injurious report rai&s;ed, he would becomingly in&s;i&s;t upon an explanation; if the matter did not claim &s;uch &s;erious procedure, the &s;ame &s;pirit would &s;et him above peeping into fragments of paper; the explanation ari&s;ing from the matter, makes Me|linda's letter rather an excre&s;&s;ence than e&s;&s;ential to the plot.</P>
<P>Kite, and the two recruits, &s;ucceed very happily to enliven the latter part of this act, which we mu&s;t con&s;ider as rather dull in the preceding &s;cenes; the &s;ong, the de&s;cription of a &s;oldier's importance, giving the recruits titles of dignity, and introducing the li&s;ting money under colour of being the king's picture, are all admirably well imagined; the &s;erjeant's explanation of Carolus too, is truly laughable; Plume's joining in their mirth, and the countryman's &s;pirit of keeping on his hat to &s;hew independency, are &s;uitably in cha|racter; Kite's roughne&s;s before his officer, on their mention of going home, and the captain's interpo&s;ition on the &s;ide of Pearmain and Apple-tree, is a true piece of recruiting policy; which, while it promotes humour in the &s;cene, carries on &s;ucce&s;sfully the de&s;ign of &s;ecuring the men as vo|lunteers; the fine&s;&s;e of giving them their choice, to go or &s;tay, after cha&s;ti&s;ing the &s;erjeant, is ex|cellent; as is al&s;o the &s;troke of &s;etting Cofter to inveigle his &s;imple companion.</P>
<P>The merit of this &s;cene lies in a very judicious, humorous contra&s;t of characters, who well know
<PB N="67" REF="75">
life, playing upon the &s;implicity of tho&s;e who do not; and it is &s;o much in nature, that a thorough acquaintance with it among young fellows in the country, would certainly much impede the &s;ucce&s;s of recruiting men-catchers.</P>
<P>Plume and Worthy commence the third act with a &s;cene, no further worth notice than as it &s;hews Plume to have a commendable indifference for a woman, whom he &s;uppo&s;es altered in her affection by a fre&s;h acqui&s;ition of fortune; and his gallanting the country market girl, Ro&s;e, to prove his freedom of heart, is a very plea&s;ing, pretty incident; indeed every one of the characters contribute to heighten and a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and the &s;tory which Kite trumps up to engage Bul|lock's attention, while the captain takes off his &s;i&s;ter, is a circum&s;tance of high wrought humour; Bullock's complaint to the ju&s;tice, concerning Ro&s;e, furni&s;hes a very laughable &s;cene.</P>
<P>The policy of introducing new characters in the third act, which was remarked upon in the STRATAGEM, is here u&s;ed to very good purpo&s;e; Bullock and Ro&s;e have been already brought for|ward, as &s;ea&s;onable enliveners of the action and dialogue; a third now appears, the facetious Cap|tain Brazen, for whom we doubt not there were many originals in Farquhar's time, and we could point out &s;everal of very &s;imilar features at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>This military &s;prig, who&s;e peculiar leading cha|racteri&s;tic appears to be unlimited effrontery, is exhibited at his fir&s;t entrance, and through the &s;cene, with much judgment, with &s;uch &s;trong out|lines,
<PB N="68" REF="76">
as plainly evince a greater &s;hare of origina|lity than imagination; his rapid addre&s;s to Wor|thy, his pert ob&s;ervation of the ju&s;tice, the for|ward introduction of him&s;elf to that gentleman, his turning the word laconic, through ignorance, into a proper name, and his di&s;cu&s;&s;ion upon that name, are ludicrou&s;ly whim&s;ical.</P>
<P>The affectation of a general acquaintance, the boa&s;t of courage, and the rhap&s;odical, &s;pirited narration concerning Frank Plume, of Northamp|ton&s;hire, are excellent ingredients to characterize the empty, opinionated coxcomb; and Brazen's departure, &s;o con&s;onant to his entrance, di&s;mi&s;&s;es him with glee.</P>
<P>Ro&s;e exhibits a very natural picture of that &s;im|ple pride and plea&s;ure which, we may &s;uppo&s;e, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the heart of an un&s;u&s;pecting country girl, upon being addre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a man as Plume; and her &s;pirited attempts at improved behaviour before the ju&s;tice are extremely plea&s;ant; as is al&s;o the captain's attack upon her without &s;eeing Ballance, from whence an agreeable confu&s;ion ari&s;es, which terminates the &s;cene laughably.</P>
<P>Mode&s;t Mrs. Melinda, and her mode&s;t maid Lucy, next make their appearance; the former, in her &s;econd &s;peech, utters a &s;entiment which we may pronounce the e&s;&s;ence of infamy,&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Flan|ders lace is as con&s;tant a pre&s;ent from officers to their women, as &s;omething el&s;e is from their women to them;"</Q>
and the latter replies in a very knowing &s;train, which her mi&s;tre&s;s takes care to enforce by explanation; in &s;hort, as this &s;cene has no tendency but rai&s;ing offen&s;ive ideas, we
<PB N="69" REF="77">
wi&s;h and recommend the omi&s;&s;ion of it. Brazen, in his addre&s;s to the lady, and rhodomontade de|clarations, pre&s;ents a diverting peculiarity of cha|racter; and Melinda's encouragement of him, to mortify Worthy, &s;uits well a coquetti&s;h heart.</P>
<P>Plume's tip&s;y condition varies the action and dialogue of his character &s;ea&s;onably, giving him an additional &s;upply of &s;pirit and humour; but Worthy's &s;etting on Plume to recover Melinda from his rival, and &s;heering off, as if afraid to plead his own cau&s;e, &s;hew that gentleman in a very &s;trange light, either fool or coward at lea&s;t; the encounter between Plume and Brazen is whim&s;ically imagined, and generally gives &s;atis|faction; the &s;ighing &s;wain comes in conveniently to take off his conde&s;cending mi&s;tre&s;s, who kindly flies to him when apprehen&s;ive of danger, and without any other retreat for &s;afety.</P>
<P>Sylvia appears at this point of time metamor|pho&s;ed into the appearance of a young fellow, a circum&s;tance not very con&s;i&s;tent with delicate re|&s;erve, nor even common mode&s;ty, tho' authorized by many examples in private life, and frequently adopted on the &s;tage. When Shake&s;peare wrote, no woman appeared on the &s;tage, therefore Ro&s;a|lind, Imogen, Portia, &amp;c. were well calculated; but at pre&s;ent we imagine plots might be carried on upon more probable principles of deception; in this &s;tate, however, Sylvia makes a very agree|able figure, and plays upon the rival officers with great archne&s;s; in their &s;everal offers we find the author exhibiting keen &s;atire again&s;t the army, when Brazen &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline">"you &s;hall receive your pay,
<PB N="70" REF="78">
and do no duty;"</Q>
the lady makes this very poignant return,&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"then you mu&s;t make me a field officer;"</Q>
and a little lower there is a mo&s;t excellent &s;troke again&s;t making men of little edu|cation, and le&s;s religion, military chaplains.</P>
<P>Kite's method of introducing and recommend|ing him&s;elf to the &s;uppo&s;ed recruit is highly artful; and taking her off while the captains are engaged, a good method of terminating the rencounter without blood&s;hed; as to Plume's di&s;tinction of fighting for a man, and not for a woman, it ap|pears to us irreconcileable; an affront is the &s;pur to honour, and to a man of &s;pirit comes with equal force from every quarter, and, without an affront, no one of real courage will draw his &s;word.</P>
<P>Ro&s;e's communication of her intere&s;t with Plume to Sylvia in the fir&s;t &s;cene in the fourth act, is well introduced to alarm that lady with jealou&s;y; and her method of &s;ounding Plume's real di&s;po&s;ition, towards the girl, is natural; Bullock, tho' he has but a &s;mall &s;hare of the dialogue, greatly enlivens it with three or four humourous remarks. We could wi&s;h Sylvia's reply to Ro&s;e, when &s;he &s;ays, will
<Q REND="inline">"you be &s;o kind to me, &s;ir, as the captain would,"</Q>
was more con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a young lady; Plume's explanation of his de|&s;ign, in gallanting Ro&s;e, is &s;atisfactory to his mi&s;|tre&s;s, and exculpates him from a blameable inten|tion upon un&s;u&s;pecting innocence. Sylvia again goes too far, when &s;he &s;ays to Plume,
<Q REND="inline">"lie with a common &s;oldier! would not you rather lie with a common woman?"</Q></P>
<P>Melinda and Lucy, in their &s;hort &s;cene, drop
<PB N="71" REF="79">
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions &s;imilar to tho&s;e we have remark|ed upon already. Worthy, who, as it appears, &s;hewed a little re&s;entment when the lady put her&s;elf under his protection, comes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame feeling, and plays upon her pa&s;&s;ion with &s;ome degree of good &s;en&s;e, which draws her into the dilemma of behaving like a virago, and pro|duces an unexpected, unde&s;igned reception to Brazen, which is the only material circum&s;tances ari&s;ing from the interview between the lady and her two lovers.</P>
<P>Kite's appearance, and conduct as a fortune-teller, is a mo&s;t &s;atyrical burle&s;que upon the cre|dulity of tho&s;e weak minded per&s;ons who believe in the predictive knowledge of &s;uch gentry; his appropriation of the &s;un, moon, and deities, to terre&s;trial circum&s;tances and &s;tations, is a whim|&s;ical bam upon heathen mythology and a&s;trology; that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of characters the author originally brought forward in this &s;cene is now much, and very properly, curtailed in repre&s;entation; to con|fe&s;s the truth, except &s;ome little u&s;e to the plot, and a joke or two about the Devil under the table, there is nothing de&s;erving notice in what remains.</P>
<P>Plume's di&s;covery of Melinda's being the cau&s;e that Sylvia was &s;ent into the country, occurs agree|ably; and the compliments he pays the fair &s;ex for having entertained an injurious opinion of her, de&s;erves rather a better epithet than pretty; how|ever we could wi&s;h they had not been twi&s;ted into rhime, but Mr. WILKES loved to &s;peak an epilogue to every act, and, as he plea&s;ed the audience, Far|quhar thought it a duty to plea&s;e him.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80">At the beginning of the fifth act we find Syl|via in cu&s;tody, and brought before the ju&s;tice, as it appears, for &s;educing Ro&s;e; her intimacy with military weddings is not very characteri&s;tic for a young lady of fortune and genteel education; and when &s;he &s;peaks of paying whores, with a pinch, it is &s;till a greater tre&s;pa&s;s on due bounds; indeed the whole &s;cene means little, and but for hone&s;t Bullock would be very in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>Melinda and Worthy, according to conjuror Kite's prediction, meet, when after &s;ome alterca|tion, in which he charges her with cruelty, and &s;he him with ba&s;e de&s;igns upon her virtue, which he repents not having put in practice, they patch up a &s;trange, unprincipled accommodation; the three en&s;uing &s;cenes contain &s;mall matter of entertain|ment, nor is that of the ju&s;tices and recruits much to be admired. Sylvia's behaviour before the bench, is con&s;i&s;tent with her de&s;ign of provoking them to pre&s;s her; yet &s;ome of her remarks might as well have been omitted, particularly that when the con&s;table charges her with a rape, and receives this reply;
<Q REND="inline">"is it your wife or daughter, booby? I ravi&s;hed them both ye&s;terday."</Q></P>
<P>Brazen's rencounter with Worthy, their fero|cious intentions, their battle and no battle, with Lucy's method of di&s;&s;ipating the &s;torm, &s;hew the author hard &s;et to accompli&s;h his cata&s;trophe, which is &s;till more plainly evinced by Ballance's &s;hort interview with his &s;teward: the remainder of this act hurries on without any manner of &s;pirit, humour, intricacy, or &s;urprize.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="81">To con&s;ider the plot of this comedy in general, we &s;hall find it vague, unconnected, and depending on very low &s;hifts, the fragment of a torn letter being a main in&s;trument; one remarkable incon|gruity is, that Silvia &s;hould appear in a &s;uit of her brother's cloaths before her father without di&s;co|very, though we find, on the &s;teward's bare men|tion of tho&s;e cloaths, he immediately &s;ees into the deception; Silvia's contrivance of being given to Plume as a recruit, is a pitiful, equivocal method of keeping her promi&s;e given in the &s;econd act, that &s;he would never give her&s;elf away without her father's con&s;ent; Ballance's way of &s;ounding, whe|ther Plume is privy to the &s;cheme, and the cap|tain's generous method of di&s;charging the &s;uppo&s;ed recruit, to oblige his friend, are circum&s;tances of merit. All the under-plot of Lucy is a mere make-&s;hift, and utterly contemptible.</P>
<P>Plume is an agreeable well drawn character; &s;en|&s;ible, ea&s;y and &s;pirited; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage with|out being fond of &s;hewing it; feeling to love yet free from amorous weakne&s;s, gallant but not vicious; liberal in &s;entiment, unaffected in expre&s;&s;ion, and di&s;engaged in action; a credit to his author, and a compliment to the army; con&s;idered in this amiable light it is not to be wondered that &s;o few performers hit him off happily in repre&s;entation; the ea&s;e of an accompli&s;hed gentleman, and the milder virtues are much more difficult to exhibit plea&s;ingly, than low humour, &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, or fa&s;hionable vices&mdash;a very humane hone&s;t man may a&s;&s;ume &s;ucce&s;sfully the tyrant, or villain, in full contra&s;t to his own na|ture;
<PB N="74" REF="82">
but it is impo&s;&s;ible to put on the port and de|meanour of a gentleman, unle&s;s the actor is really one, at lea&s;t in external appearance; the late Mr. PALMER was much re&s;pected in this part, and in|deed for the drunken &s;cene de&s;erved exten&s;ive ap|plau&s;e; but in all the re&s;t, had far too great a taint of the coxcomb, which was &s;o very natural to him in private life, that he could hardly ever &s;hake it off on the &s;tage. Mr. RYAN, under the heavy di&s;ad|vantages of advanced years, and a mo&s;t unfavourable voice, &s;upported the captain with characteri&s;tic &s;pi|rit, but we mu&s;t give Mr. SMITH an undoubted &s;uperiority for uniform ea&s;e, elegance, and &s;uitable vivacity; being the unaffected gentleman in private life, he is nece&s;&s;arily &s;o on the &s;tage; and it may with critical ju&s;tice be &s;aid, that he is both as much and as little of an actor, in this part, as any one who ever undertook it.</P>
<P>Mr. LEE figured Plume extremely well, and had con&s;iderable merit in performing it; but from la|borious attempts, which are u&s;ual with him, to make more of the character than the author intended, he abated much of that plea&s;ure the propriety of more &s;pontaneous action mu&s;t give in this part.</P>
<P>Brazen is very happily contra&s;ted to his brother-officer; free without ea&s;e, talkative without &s;en&s;e, vain without con&s;equence, full of fal&s;e fire, yet not without &s;ome &s;parks of real courage; Farquhar in drawing this military coxcomb, has pre&s;erved due re&s;pect for the army; he has indeed rendered him ridiculous, but not contemptible; we may laugh at his follies, but cannot frown at his vices; for un|le&s;s
<PB N="75" REF="83">
&s;ome few harmle&s;s inva&s;ions of truth, to flatter his own vanity, may be deemed vice, he does not appear to have any; as a gallant, he appears more venal than affectionate, as a companion, more di|verting than rational, and as a man, more made up of unpremeditated whim, than &s;ubtle de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THE. CIBBER was by no means in&s;ipid in this part, but he often plea&s;ed upon wrong principles, particularly here; as he ran into the evident ab&s;ur|dity of adding Abel Drugger's grimace to the ele|gant deportment of Foppington; both which are totally incon&s;i&s;tent with Brazen, and utterly incon|gruous to each other; the &s;mart and the beau are each a di&s;tinct &s;pecies of foppery, and &s;hould be carefully marked.</P>
<P>Mr. WOODWAED, as in every thing he does, di&s;|plays much plea&s;antry; yet, like the la&s;t mentioned gentleman, makes us laugh in contradiction to judg|ment, by u&s;ing a &s;ententious quaintne&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion in&s;tead of the precipitate, &s;nip-&s;nap, rhap&s;odical mode of utterance, as is plainly intended for the character; we mu&s;t al&s;o lament, as we &s;hall often have occa&s;ion to do, that &s;o many of Harlequin's mi&s;placed, pantomimical beauties &s;hould be tran&s;|planted with &s;uch unlimited luxuriance into the cha&s;ter &s;cenes of comedy.</P>
<P>After &s;aying thus much of two capital comedi|ans, I hope it will not be thought partial to remark, that Mr. O'BRIEN's per&s;on, manner, and executive powers di&s;played the true <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ais quoi</HI> of acting; and that critici&s;m had very little left to wi&s;h for
<PB N="76" REF="84">
even on his fir&s;t appearance, though a more tickli&s;h part never fell to the lot of a young beginner.</P>
<P>Balance is a con&s;i&s;tent, &s;en&s;ible, worthy country-gentleman, and, as drawn, much more becoming a commi&s;&s;ion of the peace than many real magi|&s;trates; in performance, no peculiar excellence can be expected; however, Mr. QUIN made him ex|tremely re&s;pectable, and Mr. SPARKS was &s;everal degrees above any pre&s;ent competitor; many parts a&s;&s;i&s;t the actor, but this is one of a larger num|ber which lie heavy on him; therefore doing it ju&s;tice claims the greater merit.</P>
<P>Serjeant Kite, with moderate executive abilities, mu&s;t plea&s;e, as he &s;peaks to the feelings in every line; there appears little difficulty in repre&s;entation, and yet mo&s;t who have undertaken him vary from &s;trict propriety; &s;ome turn him into a noi&s;y bully, and others into a &s;ubtle &s;ycophant; that he is part|ly compri&s;ed of both we own, yet they &s;hould be &s;o blended that neither may vi&s;ibly predominate; his cunning &s;hould &s;often his con&s;equence, and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency render his art plau&s;ible. Mr. BERRY&mdash; a good actor in &s;ome things&mdash;was here heavy to a degree; Mr. ANDERSON quite in&s;ipid; nor is Mr. MORRIS, though nearer the mark by far, what we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Bullock need not &s;eek for a more adequate friend than Mr. DUNSTALL; as to the Recruits, they are laughable &s;impletons, that &s;eldom fail of proper ef|fect; to di&s;tingui&s;h any in the&s;e parts, where all we have &s;een are &s;o much upon a level, would be partial,
<PB N="77" REF="85">
and &s;etting down the whole would be giving an un|nece&s;&s;ary catalogue of names, mo&s;t of which are but little, and &s;ome not at all known.</P>
<P>Worthy, who in no degree de&s;erves his name, be|ing void, as far as we &s;ee, of virtue as well as vice, is &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;onable water-gruel, tame, pitiful lover, that he mu&s;t be an e&s;timable performer who &s;hields him from ab&s;olute contempt, which by a well-adapted placidity of performance, Mr. HULL agree|bly effects, having judgment to inform him where mediocrity is merit.</P>
<P>Sylvia, the capital lady, has &s;pirit and &s;en&s;e; but the former runs her into female quixoti&s;m, and the latter often dwindles into licentiou&s;ne&s;s; her di&s;|gui&s;e, and the &s;ituation it con&s;equently throws her into, is very indelicate; the &s;cheme by which &s;he ob|tains her wi&s;hes, wild, improbable, and culpable&mdash; yet while Mrs. WOFFINGTON filled this character, there was not a more agreeable one on the &s;tage, equally <HI>degage&eacute;</HI> in the female and male &s;emblance, &s;he ravi&s;hed in both; rendering even ab&s;urdities plea&s;ing by the elegance of her appearance and vi|vacity of her expre&s;&s;ion; as far as her figure would admit, Mrs. PRITCHARD was excellent: at pre&s;ent, Mi&s;s MACKLIN ju&s;tly enjoys a con&s;iderable &s;hare of reputation in it, having &s;pirit of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;en&s;ibi|lity of look, delicacy of empha&s;is, and gentility of deportment.</P>
<P>Melinda is a vicious heap of incon&s;i&s;tencies, with a &s;hallow head and bad heart, without a &s;ingle cir|cum&s;tance or &s;peech worth notice, except &s;ome which call for cen&s;ure; we never &s;aw any body ex|hibit

her who de&s;erved the lea&s;t mention in criti|ci&s;m; Lucy is an ob&s;cure, worthle&s;s engine of the under-plot&mdash;Ro&s;e is a plea&s;ing, well-drawn picture of rural innocence and humorous &s;implicity; in performance, we &s;hall &s;ay ju&s;t the &s;ame of her as of Cherry in the Stratagem.</P>
<P>The unities of time and place are tolerably well pre&s;erved in this comedy; but the plot has no trace of a moral, and the cata&s;trophe is huddled up with|out any degree of poetical ju&s;tice&mdash;Sylvia, by the bye, a dangerous le&s;&s;on for young ladies&mdash;in con|&s;equence of hazarding her virtue, obtains her wi&s;hes&mdash;Melinda gains the man &s;he has u&s;ed infa|mou&s;ly, and Worthy gets the woman he would have debauched; while poor, inoffen&s;ive Brazen is left, unrepining, to &s;olace him&s;elf with twenty recruits in|&s;tead of twenty thou&s;ands pounds: in &s;hort, it ap|pears that our author, who&s;e dialogue is unaffected and plea&s;ant, con&s;idered entertainment more than in&s;truction; &s;o that I &s;hall venture to affirm, the Recruiting Officer, though it makes us merry, both in the clo&s;et and on the &s;tage, will never leave any u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ions from either.</P>

<HEAD>MACBETH. Written by SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>PReternatural beings afford the wide&s;t, mo&s;t lux|uriant field for genius to &s;port, and ideas to vege|tate in; of this being truly &s;en&s;ible, and willing to give his <HI>mu&s;e of fire</HI> unlimited &s;cope, Shake&s;peare has in &s;everal pieces availed him&s;elf, but in none more powerfully than the tragedy now before us; how|ever though critically we mu&s;t admire that characte|ri&s;tic peculiarity of &s;entiment, and expre&s;&s;ion, which di&s;tingui&s;h the Witches, it is neverthele&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that exhibiting &s;uch per&s;onages and phan|toms as never had any exi&s;tence but in credulous or heated imaginations, tends to impre&s;s &s;uper&s;ti|tious feelings and fears upon weak minds; for which rea&s;on, we con&s;ider every dramatic piece which treats the audience with a gho&s;t, fairy, or witch, as improper for young, unexperienced &s;pec|tators in particular; if, as is well known, old wo|mens &s;tories of &s;uch, impre&s;s a timidity upon every child who hears their terrifying tales; a timidity which la&s;ts to the conclu&s;ion of life; may we not infer apprehen&s;ions of their having a more forceable effect from being realized on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that interdicting &s;uch poetical auxiliaries would cramp genius, and deprive us of many unparalelled beauties; to this the an&s;wer is plain, that nothing which has not a good effect, or
<PB N="80" REF="88">
at lea&s;t an inoffen&s;ive tendency, &s;hould be deemed beautiful, or &s;tand e&s;timation.</P>
<P>From what is thus premi&s;ed, we hope no other charge will be laid again&s;t Shake&s;peare, than the barbarous and credulous ta&s;te of the times in which he wrote, and to which he &s;ubmitted, with po&s;&s;ibly an oblique de&s;ign of flattering the favourite opinion of James the fir&s;t; yet allowing this to be really the ca&s;e, it cannot exculpate his preternatural beings, as &s;uch, from rational cen&s;ure, for the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned above; notwith&s;tanding the author had hi&s;torical tradition to countenance his introduction of them; after this general, and we hope, ju&s;t objection again&s;t the weird &s;i&s;ters, we are to take the piece as it &s;tands, and con&s;ider di&s;tinctly its &s;everal component parts.</P>
<P>Macbeth commences with all the apparatus of terror&mdash;a &s;torm! a de&s;art! and three withered hags of little le&s;s than infernal appearance; their &s;hort conference is full of meaning, and a kind of oracu|lar ob&s;curity; their &s;udden di&s;appearance gains a de&s;ire in the &s;pectators to &s;ee them again, and to know in what &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;uch extraordinary agents are to be employed; but we know not why they &s;hould <HI>&s;ink</HI> under the &s;tage, immediately after pronounc|ing the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Hover</HI> through the fog and filthy air."</Q></P>
<P>The King's appearance to hear an account of the battle; that account, related by a wounded officer, with &s;uch energy of de&s;cription, and &s;o much to the honour of Duncan's generals; are good pre|parations to po&s;&s;e&s;s us of the heroic part of Mac|beth's
<PB N="81" REF="89">
part of Macbeth's character&mdash;but why this expre&s;s of victory &s;hould be &s;ent by &s;o imperfect a me&s;&s;en|ger as one, who&s;e wounds, yet green, wanted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;urgeon, we cannot think; if the whole relation had come from Ro&s;&s;e, it would have been rather more &s;uitable, and would have given his character &s;omewhat more importance.</P>
<P>The witches, at their next meeting, que&s;tion each other concerning their &s;everal employments, and the replies &s;hew them pregnant with that diabolic ma|levolence which is charged again&s;t them; the threats vented again&s;t the &s;ailor, who&s;e wife had refu&s;ed one of them che&s;nuts, &s;trike every feeling mind with &s;ympathetic terror; their preparation for Macbeth has &s;omething my&s;tically &s;olemn in it.</P>
<P>The notice taken of the&s;e odd oppearances by Banquo, is &s;uch as would naturally occur to a man of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit; and their alternate climax of congratulation to Macbeth much in character; him they hail in plain and po&s;itive terms of prophecy, which throws him, very judiciou&s;ly, into a &s;tate of &s;ilent and confu&s;ed reflection; the author well knew, that no words at this period would equal the more &s;uitable &s;peech of countenance and action; therefore makes Banquo, who&s;e open, di&s;intere&s;ted heart takes no alarm, fill up a well-adapted pau&s;e of the principal character, by que&s;tioning the &s;i&s;ters concerning him&s;elf; their replies to him are flatter|ing, but aenigmatical, and &s;eem to rou&s;e Macbeth to a curio&s;ity of further information, which, how|ever, is properly checked for this time, by the de|parture of the Witches: in his &s;peech to them there
<PB N="82" REF="90">
appears an ob&s;ervation incon&s;i&s;tent with what is mentioned in the preceding &s;cene; Macbeth &s;ays,
<Q><L>But how of Cawdor? The thame of Cawdor lives</L>
<L>A <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> gentleman.</L></Q></P>
<P>An un&s;ucce&s;sful rebel taken pri&s;oner, as Caw|dor mu&s;t be, by Duncan's &s;entencing of him to death, could not ju&s;tly be called <HI>pro&s;perous,</HI> e&s;pe|cially by the general who has lately overthrown him, but this is by no means a material lap&s;e; what we find a little further on, &s;hews more &s;trange con|fu&s;ion, when Macbeth ob&s;erves, that Cawdor lives, and a&s;ks,
<Q>Why do you dre&s;s me in his borrow'd robes?</Q></P>
<P>Angus makes this reply,
<Q><L>&mdash;Who was the thane yet lives,</L>
<L>But under heavy judgment bears that life,</L>
<L>Which he de&s;erves to lo&s;e&mdash;whether he was</L>
<L>Combin'd with Norway, or did line the rebel</L>
<L>With hidden help and 'vantage; or, that with both</L>
<L>He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;</L>
<L>But trea&s;ons capital, confe&s;s'd, and prov'd,</L>
<L>Have overthrown him.</L></Q></P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, that Angus was pre&s;ent when Ro&s;&s;e particulari&s;ed Cawdor's rebellious con|duct to the king, notwith&s;tanding he here expre&s;&s;es &s;uch ignorance of the cau&s;e of his impeachment.</P>
<P>Macbeth's feelings upon this unexpected acqui|&s;ition, verifying in part the prediction which has been &s;o lately pronounced to him; the dawnings of ambition which break out upon his unconnected me|diation, are extremely natural: but his adverting to murther, for obtaining the &s;tate of royalty in
<PB N="83" REF="91">
view, &s;hew him much too &s;u&s;ceptible of villainous impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>There are many circum&s;tances and events to bring about the mo&s;t unthought of changes in hu|man affairs, wherefore that man who premeditates the wor&s;t means at fir&s;t, mu&s;t have by nature a deep depravation of heart; and &s;uch Macbeth will appear infected with, from the whole of that &s;peech which begins <Q REND="inline">"Two truths are told,"</Q> &amp;c. notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome what like palliation is offered in two or three lines; indeed his conclu&s;ion &s;eems to bani&s;h what he beautifully &s;tiles <HI>fanta&s;tical murther</HI>; but cannot bani&s;h from &s;pectators his barbarous ideas &s;o &s;uddenly conceived; we have dwelt upon this cir|cum&s;tance to &s;trengthen our opinion, that the au|thor meant to draw him a dete&s;table mon&s;ter, which &s;ome critics have rather di&s;puted, allowing him a generous di&s;po&s;ition, which we find no in&s;tance of; even the con&s;cientious &s;truggles which we &s;hall pre|&s;ently find him engaged with, might ari&s;e in the mo&s;t villainous nature&mdash;he who does a bad action preci|pitately, or without knowing it to be &s;uch, may &s;tand in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;able; but when a man has &s;crupulou&s;ly weighed every relative circum&s;tance in the nice&s;t &s;cale of reflection; and after all deter|mines upon what nature, gratitude, and ju&s;tice, would avoid, he mu&s;t be compo&s;ed of the wor&s;t ma|terials.</P>
<P>To coroborate the general idea of Macbeth's cha|racter, which we have here offered, and which will be enlarged upon when we go through the whole piece, let us view him in the very next &s;cene, where,
<PB N="84" REF="92">
after a mo&s;t cordial reception from the king, with unbounded promi&s;es of future favours, he is &s;o po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of his ba&s;e purpo&s;e, that, void of even com|mon gratitude, he replies, upon Duncan's appoint|ing Malcolm prince of Cumberland,
<Q><L>The prince of Cumberland! that is a &s;tep</L>
<L>On which I mu&s;t fall down, or el&s;e o'er-leap:</L>
<L>For in my way it lies&mdash;Stars hide your fires,</L>
<L>Let not night &s;ee my black and deep de&s;ires;</L>
<L>The eye wink at the end&mdash;yet let that be,</L>
<L>Which the eye fears, when it is done, to &s;ee.</L></Q></P>
<P>From this pa&s;&s;age it appears, that not content with the &s;imple idea of regicide, he determines to cut off the whole family, in return for being loaded with honours by royal favour; and at the very in|&s;tant, when this un&s;u&s;pecting monarch, and friend, places him&s;elf upon his ho&s;pitable reception; if this does not prove Macbeth an exception to the &s;atiri&s;t's remark, <HI>Nemo repente fuit turpi&s;&s;imus,</HI> we know not what can.</P>
<P>Lady Macbeth, and her hu&s;band's letter, are ju|diciou&s;ly introduced; but &s;ure &s;uch &s;ympathetic bar|barity was never in nature, as &s;uddenly, on the in|&s;tant, breaks out in the&s;e words,
<Q><L>Glamis thou art and Cawdor&mdash;and &s;halt be</L>
<L>What thou art promi&s;ed.</L></Q></P>
<P>What follows accu&s;es Macbeth of a milky &s;oft|ne&s;s in his nature, of which he does not &s;eem at all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles of con&s;cience cannot ju&s;tly be called &s;o; however, that he may not have the whole load of aggravated guilt to bear alone, our author has made this matchle&s;s lady&mdash; we lament &s;o dete&s;table, though a po&s;&s;ible, picture of

the fair &s;ex&mdash;exert uncommon talents of tempta|tion; on hearing of the king's vi&s;it, with mo&s;t un|relenting precipitation of thought, &s;he dooms the royal vi&s;itant&mdash;Her invocation to &s;pirits of evil in|fluence is worthy of a powerful imagination, and Macbeth's interruptive entrance extremely well timed; but we mu&s;t offer &s;ome doubt, whether the word <HI>blanket</HI> of the dark, does not convey a low and improper idea.</P>
<P>Macbeth's mention of Duncan's approach with|out making any previous reply to his wife's cordial reception, is a natural effect of what &s;its neare&s;t his heart; and her coming to the main point at once, is well devi&s;ed for working him up to her great purpo&s;e; her confining the &s;entiment of mur|ther in le&s;s than a line, and warning him to di&s;|gui&s;e tho&s;e looks which appear too intelligible, im|pre&s;s us with a &s;trong idea of her policy, as does her &s;econd hint of Duncan's death, and promi&s;ing to take a great part of the dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;cene before the ca&s;tle has nothing ma|terial in it, except the following truly poetical re|mark made by Banquo:
<Q><L>&mdash;This gue&s;t of &s;ummer,</L>
<L>The temple-haunting martlet, does approve</L>

<L>Hath made his pendant bed, and procreant cradle:</L>
<L>Where they mo&s;t breed and haunt, I have ob&s;erv'd,</L>
<L>The air is delicate.</L></Q></P>
<P>Lady Macbeth's &s;trained compliment to the king has al&s;o merit, as being natural, no truth being

<P>In &s;uch a &s;tate of guilty perturbation as Macbeth now appears, no mode of expre&s;&s;ion could be &s;o &s;uitable as that of &s;oliloquy; it were to be wi&s;hed, however, that our great author, pur&s;uing energy, had not in &s;ome &s;entences bordered upon ob&s;curity, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages as only re|peated on the &s;tage, where the ear mu&s;t inevitably be too quick for reception: in an alteration of this play, which has been often performed, there are &s;ome attempts to render the lines we &s;peak of more intelligible, but, like mo&s;t other paraphra&s;es, they de&s;troy the e&s;&s;ential &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The reflection, that if he could but gain ea&s;e even in this life, he would jump the life to come, is ra|ther wildly impious; but the inevitable temporal puni&s;hment of a con&s;cience, loaded with guilt, is very well and commendably inculcated; the arguments for declining the murther are &s;o forcible, that no|thing but the mo&s;t hardened heart, under &s;uch con|viction, would proceed&mdash;Where he per&s;onifies pity, and mounts her a&s;tride on the <HI>bla&s;t,</HI> fancy takes a very vigorous flight, nor does expre&s;&s;ion fall be|neath, yet we are afraid they leave propriety behind; the following lines are in our opinion very excep|tionable:
<Q><L>&mdash; I have no &s;pur</L>

<P>Macbeth's reply to the very gro&s;s rebuff he has ju&s;t received, is as conci&s;e, &s;ignificant, and noble a one as ever was uttered; but his bloody-minded virago's next &s;peech, towards the conclu&s;ion, wounds humanity with &s;uch a &s;entiment as no wo|man &s;hould utter, nor any rational being hear;

<P>The midnight interview of Macbeth and Banquo, at the beginning of the &s;econd act, very properly u&s;hers in the dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s then in agitation; that prophetic heavine&s;s of heart, mentioned by the former, his pre&s;enting a fre&s;h mark of favour from the king to lady Macbeth, his &s;peaking of the three weird &s;i&s;ters, and Macbeth's affecting to &s;light the remembrance of them, tho' not very obvious, are yet con&s;iderable beauties; we could heartily wi&s;h this pa&s;&s;age did not occur,

<P><PB N="89" REF="97">In Macbeth's &s;oliloquy, where a vi&s;ionary dagger &s;trikes his mind's eye, the abrupt introduction of that alarming object is very judicious and beauti|ful; nor can any thing be more natural than the effect it has on Macbeth, which is mo&s;t admirably de&s;cribed, and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed by a nervous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of breaks, which, for a dozen or four|teen lines, ri&s;e into a powerful climax of confu&s;ion &mdash;the momentary pau&s;e of unclouded rea&s;on which relieves imagination from her painful load, and the quick return of coward con&s;cience diver&s;ify the &s;en|timent and action in a mo&s;t intere&s;ting manner; the picture of midnight, as favouring witchcraft, rapes and murther, concludes this inimitable &s;oli|loquy with a due &s;olemnity of terror; a &s;oliloquy of &s;uch un&s;peakable merit, that, like charity, it may apologize for a multitude of faults.</P>
<P>Lady Macbeth, at her entrance, gives us a piece of information not very defen&s;ible, unle&s;s it is meant as &s;ome palliation of her character&mdash;the fal&s;e fire of liquor, for which &s;he &s;eems to have very little occa&s;ion, mu&s;t be, in her &s;ituation, rather a dangerous re&s;ource: the remainder of her &s;peech is happily disjointed by earne&s;t expectation and jealous apprehen&s;ion.&mdash;The remark, that a likene&s;s of her father in Duncan's &s;leeping appearance, prevented her from doing the bu&s;ine&s;s her&s;elf, lets in a gleam of humanity upon this female fiend.</P>
<P>The entrance of Macbeth, his high-wrought confu&s;ion, and every &s;yllable of the en&s;uing &s;cene, exhibit an unparalelled combination of judgment and genius, calculated to awake the drow&s;ie&s;t feel|ings,
<PB N="90" REF="98">
and to alarm the mo&s;t re&s;olute heart&mdash;the picture of the grooms crying out in di&s;turbed dreams&mdash;one <Q REND="inline">"Heaven ble&s;s us,"</Q> and <Q REND="inline">"amen"</Q> the other, with the inimitable de&s;cription of &s;leep, and the idea of nature's general friend being mur|thered in that &s;leep, are a&s;toni&s;hing efforts of men|tal ability, and, for &s;o much, certainly place Shake&s;peare beyond any degree of comparative merit.</P>
<P>The refu&s;al of Macbeth to go again into the &s;cene of blood, is an apt &s;troke of well-timed re|mor&s;e; indeed his bringing the daggers from the place they &s;hould have been left in, is an extreme well-judged mark of confu&s;ion; however, we would rather have forfeited that in&s;tance of judgment, than have heaped &s;uch &s;avage inhumanity upon the female; her boa&s;t of having hands crim&s;oned like tho&s;e of her hu&s;band, carries the offen&s;ive colour|ing &s;till higher: what &s;ucceeds, on the interrup|tion of knocking, is expre&s;&s;ed very characteri&s;ti|cally.</P>
<P>To what end Shake&s;peare could introduce &s;o in|congruous a character as the porter, who is com|mendably omitted in repre&s;entation, we believe no mortal can tell; at &s;uch an intere&s;ting period to turn the mo&s;t &s;erious feelings into laughter, or ra|ther into di&s;ta&s;te, by a &s;tring of &s;trained quibbles is an in&s;ult upon judgment, and mu&s;t fill the imagi|nation with chaos of idea.&mdash;Some more &s;uitable pau&s;e might have been made to give Macbeth time for compo&s;ing his ruffled figure; the &s;hort &s;cene between him, Macduff, and Lenox, is well calcu|lated;
<PB N="91" REF="99">
Lenox's remarks upon the night are very con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious principles on which this play is chiefly founded; and Macduff's exclamatory entrance di&s;covers Duncan's murther properly.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive entrances and exits of various characters, the real grief of &s;ome, and the feigned &s;orrow of others, Macbeth's apology for his poli|tical &s;troke of killing the grooms, by an affecting picture of Duncan's &s;ituation, and the rapid re&s;olu|tion of enquiring judicially into &s;o unaccountable an event, are all well arranged and happily expre&s;&s;ed; but the amazing precipitate flight of Malcolm and Donalbain, without any apology, except the paltry one of in&s;tantaneous fear, places the&s;e &s;prigs of royalty in a contemptible light, and its effect on the &s;tage proves the ju&s;tice of this remark; for when one &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"I'll to England,"</Q> and the other comi|cally replies, <Q REND="inline">"To Ireland I,"</Q> nine times out of ten the audience are thrown into a hor&s;e-laugh.&mdash;we could wi&s;h this circum&s;tance was altered, as it ea&s;ily might be, by giving a few &s;peeches of &s;pirit and du|tiful affection to one or both the princes, expre&s;&s;ive of their particular determination to di&s;cover and re|venge their father's death; which might be over|ruled by Macduff's repre&s;entation of the danger they &s;tand expo&s;ed to, and that for their greater &s;ecurity it would be better to retire, till the unavoidable con|vul&s;ions of &s;tate were &s;ubdued, or till proper mea|&s;ures could be taken to e&s;tabli&s;h the legal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; this, we apprehend, would have carried them off with &s;ome grace, whereas in their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;i|tion
<PB N="92" REF="100">
they make &s;uch a wretched figure that we can &s;carce forget it, when Malcolm appears to a&s;&s;ert his right at the head of an army.</P>
<P>The continuation of omens between Ro&s;&s;e and the old man &s;eems to have little meaning unle&s;s to keep reflection in an unremitted &s;tate of terror; and un|u&s;ual events are carried to a very &s;trange pitch in|deed, when Ro&s;&s;e a&s;&s;erts that he was eye-witne&s;s of Duncan's hor&s;es eating one another.</P>
<P>Macduff's account that Macbeth is already named and gone to Scone to be inve&s;ted with royalty, is a great tre&s;pa&s;s on time, there being but twenty lines, or thereabouts, from the <HI>&s;tealing</HI> away of the princes, as it is properly phra&s;ed, and his ac|count of every thing being thus &s;ettled in con&s;e|quence of their &s;uppo&s;ed criminal e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Introducing the witches at the end of the &s;econd act is a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to a feeling mind, from the painful weight of horror which &s;ome pre|ceding &s;cenes mu&s;t have laid upon it; and, in &s;uit|able mu&s;ic, they continue the &s;tory predictively as a kind of chorus; their rejoicing in the mi&s;chief al|ready done, and that which yet lies in the womb of time, &s;hews a di&s;po&s;ition worthy &s;uch agents as the &s;ubordinate fiends of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Banquo's reflections, with which the third act be|gins, are well adapted to the circum&s;tances; and all his doubts of Macbeth's elevation, by honourable means, natural; as is al&s;o his adverting to the pro|phecy in favour of his own po&s;terity; the new king's fre&s;h profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to, and ho&s;pi|table invitation of, his former colleague and friend,

<P>In re&s;pect of Macbeth's &s;cene with the murderers, we apprehend he u&s;es too much circumlocution, e&s;pecially as we perceive, by what he &s;ays at their entrance, that tho&s;e ruffians have been made ac|quainted with a main part of the affair, Banquo's oppre&s;&s;ion of them; being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this, does it not &s;eem more natural, that the tyrant would after this line, <Q REND="inline">"We are men, my liege,"</Q> immediately come to,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Both of you know, Banquo is your enemy;</Q>
than run into the une&s;&s;ential, digre&s;&s;ive, though ju&s;t compari&s;on of men and dogs? we know it may be urged, that murtherous intentions are communicated with &s;low and jealous caution; this is undoubtedly the ca&s;e in particular characters and circum&s;tances.&mdash;It is ma&s;terly to make king John wind about the di&s;po&s;ition of Hubert gradually, he being a per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;ideration and doubtful principles; but for Macbeth to expatiate &s;o much at large, with &s;uch fellows as he &s;eems to pick out, appears a wa&s;te of words: had there been any pa&s;|&s;age to indulge the author's fancy, or to favour the performer's action and utterance, then a little &s;u|perfluity

<P>What &s;ucceeds between Macbeth and his lady is well adapted to their unavoidable perturbation; but would have fallen in better as a continuation than making two di&s;tinct &s;cenes; Macbeth's exit, after the murtherers have left him is &s;uperfluous; every thing he advances, in this &s;hort conference, &s;hews a &s;triking, poetical, yet natural picture of mental gloom and heart-felt agony; his invocation of night, and de&s;cription of its &s;olemn approach, are plea&s;ing effu&s;ions of genius.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of the murtherers, Banquo's fall, and Fleance's e&s;cape, is partly trifling, partly &s;hocking, and &s;eldom fails of proving laughable; we wi&s;h &s;omething better had been &s;ub&s;tituted, and the cir|cum&s;tance referred to a relation of it by the mur|therer; we could al&s;o wi&s;h that decorum had not &s;uffered by &s;uch a ragamuffin's entrance into a room of &s;tate, amid&s;t the whole court; and apprehend no nece&s;&s;ity for this, therefore are induced to blame it.</P>

<P>Banquo's gho&s;t, which, without being too ludi|crous, we may call the raw-head-and-bloody-bones of tragedy, is neverthele&s;s well introduced to throw Macbeth into tho&s;e violent agitations which nature mu&s;t feel, and &s;uch as furni&s;h exten&s;ive powers an almo&s;t unlimited &s;cope to &s;hew them&s;elves; the words of both Macbeth and his lady are beautifully applicable through the whole &s;cene, which con|cludes, &s;o far as the gho&s;t is concerned, with as forceable a climax of impa&s;&s;ioned terror as ever any author penned; the reflections which follow, in the conclu&s;ive part of the &s;cene, are &s;uch as na|turally ari&s;e from the &s;ubject, and are nervou&s;ly ex|pre&s;&s;ed; Macbeth's determination to con&s;ult the witches, plainly indicates the agitation and weak|ne&s;s

of a guilty heart and a &s;uper&s;titious head; we &s;hould be glad to know how he is &s;o well acquainted with their places of rendezvous, as to know exactly the &s;pot of con&s;ultation.</P>
<P>The witches receive, in the following &s;cene, a &s;harp rebuke from their &s;uperior, Hecate, for dealing in any mi&s;chief which did not originally &s;pring from her; &s;he delivers her&s;elf in a fanciful &s;tile, and opens with propriety their bu&s;ine&s;s at the pit of Acheron.</P>
<P>That remarkable incantation which begins the fourth act; the my&s;terious ceremony practi&s;ed; the emblematic ingredients collected for enchant|ment, and the arrangement of them, &s;hew a more peculiar luxuriance of fancy than any other author ever compacted into &s;uch narrow bounds; the mu|&s;ic al&s;o, as in two former &s;cenes, has a very ju&s;t and plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>Macbeth's mode of addre&s;&s;ing the witches &s;eems too much of the compul&s;ive; influenced by, and giving credit to &s;uch beings, we may naturally enough &s;uppo&s;e his approach would have been in a milder &s;train; however, he brings to view a number of &s;triking images re&s;pecting their power.</P>

<P>One would naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that Macbeth had enjoyed a full &s;ufficiency of &s;uch agreeable company, yet we find him rather di&s;plea&s;ed that they are gone; the intelligence of Macduff's flight to Eng|land is well thrown in to give &s;pirit and an opening of bu&s;ine&s;s; his wife and children being devoted to de&s;truction in con&s;equence, we might rea&s;onably expect from what has been already &s;hewn of Mac|beth's jealous, impatient cruelty.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene of Macduff's lady and &s;on, where murtherers come and demoli&s;h the latter in view of the audience, is, if we can be allowed the phra&s;e, farcically horrid; as di&s;graceful an oddity as ever invaded Shake&s;peare's mu&s;e, and therefore with great ju&s;tice omitted in repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The &s;cene between Malcolm and Macduff is very happily conducted; a politic &s;u&s;picion makes the former reprobate him&s;elf, that he may come more perfectly at the thane of Fife's real di&s;po&s;ition; who&s;e hone&s;t patriot principles mu&s;t ever warm and plea&s;e attention; tho&s;e reflections he throws out on vices, which &s;hame and endanger royalty, are in&s;tructive and beautiful; his &s;hort picture of the late king Duncan and his queen, to rou&s;e the prince, their &s;on, to emulation, nobly pathetic; and this, prov|ing the key to unlock Malcolm's re&s;erve, &s;hews great judgment.&mdash;A doctor, brought in merely to introduce mention of Engli&s;h Edward's power to cure by a touch&mdash;that very dubitable circum&s;tance

of tradition&mdash;is at be&s;t trifling, or a paltry compli|ment to the then reigning monarch, nothing at all to the matter in que&s;tion, and only breaks in abruptly upon a very intere&s;ting continuation, we mean, the heart-felt intelligence that Ro&s;&s;e brings of the fatal tragedy acted in Macduff's family; his fir&s;t &s;peaking of general griefs, the mi&s;eries of Scotland, is a well-judged preparative for a more confined and peculiar concern, relative to one of the characters pre&s;ent; indeed, Macduff's enquiry for Scotland, before his wife and children, &s;hews great magnanimity of mind; and Ro&s;&s;e's diffident man|ner of revealing their lamentable fall is &s;en&s;ibly hu|mane; hence the &s;cene, by degrees of mo&s;t exact proportion, pre&s;ents a climax of grief which never fails to work a general and &s;uitable effect, and con|cludes with a plea&s;ing, &s;pirited denunciation of re|venge again&s;t the blood-&s;tained u&s;urper; thus the fourth act terminates, leaving, as every fourth act in particular &s;hould do, an impatient expectation impre&s;&s;ed upon the audience for what mu&s;t follow.</P>

<P>Macbeth's reply to the phy&s;ician on hearing of his lady's &s;trong mental indi&s;po&s;ition, is no le&s;s worthy of capital genius, no le&s;s &s;atisfactory in &s;peaking, hearing, or reading:

to Macbeth's rage, than the two foregoing &s;peeches; they are a timely relief to the performer's expre&s;|&s;ion, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have been kept too much on the &s;train, and a delicious treat to every intelligent mind among&s;t an audience.</P>
<P>The &s;cene which follows, &s;o indeed every inter|mediate &s;cene of this act appears, only &s;erves to bring the cata&s;trophe nearer to view, and to cir|cum&s;cribe the principal character within narrower bounds, that expectation of his fate may take wing among&s;t the audience&mdash;they expre&s;s a firmer, tho' not &s;o outrageous a &s;pirit in the a&s;&s;ailing party, and therefore appear as a natural contra&s;t to the de|fen&s;ive &s;ide.</P>
<P>Macbeth, at his next appearance, again breaks out with fla&s;hes of fal&s;e fire, vaunting the im|pregnable &s;trength of his fortre&s;s.&mdash;Notwith&s;tand|ing we have expre&s;&s;ed, and really entertain a di&s;like of frequent quotation, yet &s;o &s;trong a temp|tation lies here in our way we cannot re&s;i&s;t it; and the more readily give way, being &s;en&s;ible that every reader of refined conception will rather thank us, than pa&s;s any cen&s;ure.&mdash;Be&s;ides, having pointed out &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages which, we apprehend, of a contrary nature&mdash;it &s;eems a nece&s;&s;ary point of ju&s;tice to the author.&mdash;Upon hearing a &s;cream of women, Mac|beth ob&s;erves,

<P>The foregoing &s;peech has the fir&s;t principle of intrin&s;ic merit to an eminent degree, moral in&s;truc|tion; an equal number of lines never yet exhibited a fuller, more compleat picture of the vanity of human life; and our author has, with great ad|dre&s;s, again u&s;ed the method of realizing his cha|racter, by making Macbeth &s;peak of the player as a fictitious, tran&s;itory repre&s;entative&mdash;The tran&s;ition upon a me&s;&s;enger's entrance, who mentions Birn|ham-wood as moving, is truly fine; Macbeth has re&s;ted his &s;ecurity upon the &s;andy foundation of equi|vocal promi&s;es, and now, the broken reeds falling away one by one, he plunges gradually into the rage and depths of de&s;peration; his re&s;olution to &s;ally out &s;eems rather the effect of fatal, inevitable de&s;truction than real courage.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s now encrea&s;es, and ju&s;tly hurries on to a rapidity of material events; the tyrant is, as him&s;elf aptly expre&s;&s;es it, tied to a &s;take, and therefore through compul&s;ion mu&s;t fight; as to
<PB N="103" REF="115">
the combat, wherein that unfledged warrior, young Siward, falls, it &s;eems to have very little bu&s;ine&s;s in the piece, unle&s;s to encrea&s;e a torrent of blood already exceeding all due bounds.</P>
<P>Macduff's encounter with Macbeth rai&s;es expec|tation to the very top of its bent, and ju&s;tice &s;its trembling in every humane bo&s;om for &s;o e&s;&s;ential a &s;acrifice to her as the tyrant; the introduction of Macbeth's &s;ole remaining hope, that of being in|vulnerable to any per&s;on born of a woman, &s;hews great judgment, and his feelings, on being told the fallacy of his charm, are expre&s;&s;ed in very apt terms.&mdash;Why the author cho&s;e to execute &s;o great a culprit behind the &s;cenes, thereby depriving the audience of a mo&s;t &s;atisfactory circum&s;tance, is not ea&s;y to imagine; death certainly is made, in this in&s;tance, too mode&s;t; and the bringing on a head defeats every trace of the author's new-born fal&s;e delicacy&mdash;the pre&s;ent mode of repre&s;entation is much better.</P>
<P>What follows Macbeth's fall is, like the remain|der of every tragedy when the plot is revealed, and the principal characters are di&s;po&s;ed of, a mat|ter of very little con&s;equence; therefore is con|fined, as it ought to be, within the bounds of ju|dicious brevity; Malcolm, however, gives a piece of hi&s;toric information concerning the fir&s;t in&s;titu|tion of earldoms in Scotland, which a tythe of every audience would not el&s;e know.</P>
<P>As Macbeth, in repre&s;entation, dies before the audience, it appeared nece&s;&s;ary, according to dra|matic cu&s;tom, to give him &s;ome conclu&s;ive lines,
<PB N="104" REF="116">
which Mr. GARRICK, as we have been told, has happily &s;upplied, as nothing could be more &s;uitable, or &s;triking, than to make him mention, with dy|ing breath, his guilt, delu&s;ion, the witches, and tho&s;e horrid vi&s;ions of future puni&s;hment, which mu&s;t ever appall and torture the la&s;t moments of &s;uch accumulated crimes.</P>
<P>It has been already hinted, and may be laid down as an irrefragable maxim, that moral ten|dency is the fir&s;t great and indi&s;pen&s;ible merit of any piece written for the &s;tage; in which light I am afraid the tragedy before us, though a fa|vourite child of genius, will not hold a very di&s;tin|gui&s;hed place; fate, nece&s;&s;ity, or prede&s;tination, has embarrra&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive philo&s;ophers, the mo&s;t painful theologi&s;ts, and &s;till remains matter of much perplexity to tho&s;e who endeavour to devel|ope it; SHAKESPEARE therefore, who was, no doubt, an able morali&s;t, &s;hould have declined any &s;ubject which glanced an eye that way, yet we find his Macbeth &s;trongly inculcates power of prediction, even in the wor&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible agents; inculcates a &s;upernatural influence of one mortal be|ing over another: It is but a very weak defence to &s;ay he only wrote according to the accepted notions of tho&s;e times from whence he drew his plot&mdash;ad|mitted&mdash;but whatever tends to weaken rea&s;on, to mi&s;lead the under&s;tanding, and intimidate the heart, &s;hould not be u&s;ed as a &s;ubject for dramatic compo|&s;ition, which adorns fiction with her mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive charms; weak minds are ever more liable to re|ceive prejudicial than advantageous impre&s;&s;ions;
<PB N="105" REF="117">
wherefore any character, incidents, or &s;entiments, which may work the former effect, &s;hould be in|du&s;triou&s;ly avoided; if the &s;tage, upon &s;ome occa|&s;ions, does not improve, it &s;hould at lea&s;t leave an audience no wor&s;e than it finds them, equally avoid|ing vice and credulity.</P>
<P>That we do not charge our author with pro|mulging principles of fatali&s;m without rea&s;on, let us produce two pa&s;&s;ages, exclu&s;ive of the prophe|cies, which are derived from that &s;ource&mdash;at the end of Lady Macbeth's fir&s;t &s;oliloquy, &s;he &s;ays
<Q><L>All that impedes thee from the golden round,</L>
<L>Which <HI>fate</HI> and <HI>metaphy&s;ical</HI> aid doth &s;eem</L>
<L>To have crowned thee with.</L></Q></P>
<P>Macbeth al&s;o, ju&s;t before the murtherers are intro|duced to him in the third act, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus
<Q><L>To make them kings! the &s;eed of Banquo kings!</L>
<L>Rather than &s;o, come <HI>fate</HI> into the li&s;t,</L>
<L>And champion me to the utterance.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>The very word <HI>fate,</HI> if it has any meaning at all, can boa&s;t but an unfavourable one to moral fitne&s;s; it is a term crept into common u&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom; how frequently do we hear, upon the accidental or violent death of any per&s;on, this ab|&s;urd remark made&mdash;it was his or her <HI>fate</HI>&mdash;a mi|nute inve&s;tigation of this point would run us into an unpardonable digre&s;&s;ion from our propo&s;ed &s;ub|ject, wherefore I have only &s;tarted &s;ome hints for abler critics to elucidate, or &s;et a&s;ide, as may &s;eem fit; and &s;hall only add, that the plot of Macbeth, though the unities of time and place are much in|fringed upon, does not &s;trike in repre&s;entation with any offen&s;ive ideas of improbability; but ri&s;es by
<PB N="106" REF="118">
very ju&s;t degrees to a cata&s;trophe, which is well wrought up; the moral is the &s;ame as that of Richard the Third, &s;hewing that a guilty con&s;cience is a con&s;tant tormentor, and that a royal, as well as a private murderer, is obnoxious to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Among the natural characters, if Macbeth and his lady de&s;erve &s;uch an epithet, there is very little va|riety or contra&s;t; all the men, except the principal, are tolerably hone&s;t; as to the heroine, &s;he &s;tands alone.</P>
<P>To delineate Macbeth is not ea&s;y; the author &s;eems like Prometheus, to have made a man of his own, but to have &s;tolen his animation rather from Hell than Heaven: by the account we hear of him, previous to his entrance, magnanimity and courage appear con&s;picuous in his conduct; yet, no &s;ooner does he pre&s;ent him&s;elf, but with all the weakne&s;s of unpracti&s;ed youth, he receives a &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion from old womens' progno&s;tications; and with all the aptne&s;s of a &s;tudied villain &s;ugge&s;ts the mo&s;t pernicious practices, which from that moment, with a very few &s;light intervals, take entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart; from his future proceedings, we perceive him more actuated by jealous apprehen&s;ions than &s;ound policy, more influenced by rage and de&s;pe|ration, than any degree of natural re&s;olution; cre|dulous, impatient, vindictive; ambitious without a &s;park of honour; cruel without a gleam of pity&mdash; in &s;hort, as compleat a tool for mini&s;ters of tempta|tion to work upon, as ever fancy formed, and too di&s;graceful for nature to admit among&s;t her works.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="119">However, con&s;idered in the view of theatrical action, there is not one per&s;onage to be found in our Engli&s;h drama which more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;es an audience, which requires more judgment and greater powers to do him ju&s;tice; many pa&s;&s;ages are intricate, &s;ome heavy, but for the greater part, pow|erfully impa&s;&s;ioned; the mental agitation he is thrown into, requires expre&s;&s;ion peculiarly forcible, of action, look, and utterance, even &s;o far as to make the hearts of &s;pectators &s;hrink, and to thrill their blood; indeed, every a&s;&s;i&s;tance from externals is given the actor, &s;uch as daggers, bloody hands, gho&s;ts, &amp;c. but the&s;e mu&s;t be treated judiciou&s;ly, or the effect, as we have &s;ometimes &s;een it, may take a ludicrous turn.</P>
<P>Through all the &s;oliloquies of anxious reflections in the fir&s;t act; amid&s;t the pangs of guilty appre|hen&s;ions, and pungent remor&s;e, in the &s;econd; through all the di&s;tracted terror of the third; all the impetuous curio&s;ity of the fourth, and all the de&s;peration of the fifth, Mr. GARRICK &s;hews uni|form, unabating excellence; &s;carce a look, motion, or tone, but takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our faculties, and leads them to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>As SHAKESPEARE ri&s;es above him&s;elf in many places, &s;o does this his greate&s;t and be&s;t commen|tator, who not only pre&s;ents his beauties to the imagination, but brings them home feelingly to the heart: among a thou&s;and other in&s;tances of almo&s;t necromantic merit; let us turn our recollection only to a few in the character of Macbeth; who ever &s;aw the <HI>immortal actor</HI> &s;tart at, and trace the imaginary dagger previous to Duncan's murder,
<PB N="108" REF="120">
without embodying, by &s;ympathy, un&s;ub&s;tantial air into the alarming &s;hape of &s;uch a weapon? Who ever heard the low, but piercing notes of his voice when the <HI>deed is done,</HI> repeating tho&s;e inimitable pa&s;&s;ages which mention the &s;leeping grooms, and murder of &s;leep, without feeling a vibration of the nerves?

<P>Theatrical performance to mo&s;t &s;pectators ap|pears a mechanical di&s;po&s;ition of limbs, and a pa|rotted mode of &s;peech; &s;o indeed it really is too often, but intrin&s;ic merit &s;oars far beyond &s;uch nar|row, barren limits, &s;he traces nature through her various windings, dives into her deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es, and &s;natches ten thou&s;and beauties which plodding method can never di&s;play; the dulle&s;t comprehen|&s;ion may be taught to enter on this &s;ide or that; to &s;tand on a particular board; to rai&s;e the voice here, and fall it there; but unle&s;s motion and ut|terance are regulated by a cultivated knowledge of life, and &s;elf-born intelligent feelings, no greater de|gree of excellence can be attained than unaffecting propriety; like a fair field who&s;e native fertility of &s;oil produces a beauteous luxuriant crop of &s;ponta|neous vegitation, which art can only regulate, not

enrich; Mr. GARRICK's matchle&s;s genius not only captivates our &s;portive &s;en&s;es, but al&s;o furni&s;hes high reli&s;hed &s;ub&s;tantial food for our minds to &s;trengthen by.</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN, who&s;e &s;ole merit in tragedy was de|clamation, or brutal pride, was unde&s;cribably cum|ber&s;ome in Macbeth; his face, which had no po&s;|&s;ible variation from its natural grace, except &s;tern|ne&s;s and fe&s;tivity, could not be expected to exhibit the acute &s;en&s;ations of this character; his figure, was void of the e&s;&s;ential &s;pirit, and his voice far too monotonous for the tran&s;itions which &s;o frequently occur; yet, wonderful to be told, he played it &s;e|veral years with con&s;iderable applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN &s;hewed more variety of acting in this part than any other, and made an a&s;toni&s;hing good u&s;e of his limited powers; without any ex|aggeration of compliment to that gentleman, we mu&s;t place him in a very reputable degree of com|petion with Mr. GARRICK, in the dagger &s;cene; and at the &s;ame time confe&s;s a doubt, whether any performer ever &s;poke the words,
<Q REND="inline">"this is a &s;orry &s;ight,"</Q>
better&mdash;as to the third, fourth, and fifth acts, his meaning well, was all we could ever perceive to recommend him.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY, as a capital actor&mdash;indeed a very capital one in his proper ca&s;t, made, in our com|prehen&s;ion, but a lukewarm affair of Macbeth, his amorous harmony of features and voice, could but faintly, if at all, de&s;cribe pa&s;&s;ions incident to a ty|rant in &s;uch circum&s;tances as he is placed; his commanding figure, and other requi&s;ites, pre&s;erved
<PB N="110" REF="122">
him from being in&s;ipid, though far beneath him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. POWELL&mdash;light lie the a&s;hes of the re&s;pect|able dead&mdash;was beyond doubt, partially received in this tragedy; the requi&s;ite force of expre&s;&s;ion, and a proper di&s;po&s;ition of features, were wanting; after the murder, his feelings dwindled into a kind of boyi&s;h whimpering, and his countenance rather de&s;cribed bodily than mental pain; in the third act, he &s;eemed unequal to the arduous ta&s;k of de|&s;cribing extreme horror, and in the fifth, Macbeth's weight of de&s;peration bore him down; even the &s;o|liloquies appeared too &s;ententiou&s;ly heavy for his ex|pre&s;&s;ion; as his playing the part was certainly matter of choice, we are &s;orry he ever mi&s;took his own abilities &s;o much, notwith&s;tanding he met with public indulgence; a compliment, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, due even to the failings of a performer, who di&s;|played &s;o much intrin&s;ic merit as he did on more &s;uitable occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. HOLLAND, that indu&s;trious, u&s;eful, labo|rious, imitative actor, idolized his great in&s;tructor too much to be any thing original; in Macbeth we deem him particularly unhappy; aiming to be great, he frequently lo&s;t all trace of character: un|tunably &s;tiff in all his declamation; mechanical in action; ungracious in attitude; affected in feeling; unharmonious in tones; irregular in empha&s;is; and wild in pa&s;&s;ion; yet having an agreeable per&s;on, &s;ignificant a&s;pect, and powerful voice, he often plea&s;ed his audience, and kept attention awake,
<PB N="111" REF="123">
while judgment was obliged to &s;lumber, or &s;eek &s;afety in &s;ilence, from popular prejudice.</P>
<P>Among many theatrical circum&s;tances much to be lamented, is that terrible nece&s;&s;ity which forces Mr. SMITH into an undertaking &s;o oppo&s;ite to every one of his requi&s;ites, except figure; we are confident his good &s;en&s;e agrees with us, that &s;ad|dling him with the part is an impo&s;ition upon that good nature and integrity which &s;timulate him to work through thick and thin, for the &s;upport of Covent-Garden hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Macduff is a part of no great action, except on di&s;covery of the King's murder, and the fourth act &s;cene; Me&s;&s;rs. RYAN and HAVARD both did him great ju&s;tice, yet we mu&s;t be of opinion that Mr. REDDISH depicts him with &s;uperior &s;trength and beauty: his feelings are manly, yet tender; &s;pirited without exce&s;s; and to us convey whatever an au|thor intended, or an audience can wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Banquo's chief merit is as a gho&s;t; here Mr. ROSS made the mo&s;t &s;triking, picture&s;que appear|ance we have ever &s;een, and with peculiar grace even beautified horror: All the re&s;t of the men in this play are unworthy notice.</P>
<P>Lady Macbeth, as to the dete&s;table compo&s;ition of her character, has been &s;ufficiently animadverted on, therefore little more is nece&s;&s;ary than to ob|&s;erve, that though there does not appear much call for capital merit, yet &s;everal fir&s;t-rate actre&s;&s;es have made but a languid figure in repre&s;enting her.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mrs. WOFFINGTON was ex|tremely well received, and really did the part as
<PB N="112" REF="124">
well as her deplorable tragedy voice would admit; we mu&s;t place Mrs. PRITCHARD foremo&s;t; who made a very ju&s;t di&s;tinction in the &s;cene where Banquo's gho&s;t appears, between reproving Mac|beth's behaviour with pa&s;&s;ion, or the anxiety of ap|prehen&s;ion, le&s;t he &s;hould betray his guilt; this lat|ter method &s;he happily pur&s;ued, and here, as well as in the &s;leeping &s;cene, gained manife&s;t &s;uperiority. Mrs. YATES, at pre&s;ent, comes neare&s;t the point of prai&s;e, but certainly di&s;plays no very con&s;picuous merit in the character; and to mention Mrs. BARRY would be to injure her, as it certainly does not at all coincide with her capabilities.</P>
<P>The witches we &s;hould take no notice of, but for a &s;uppo&s;ed amendment in &s;peaking and dre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e characters at Covent-Garden; as beings out of the cour&s;e of nature, SHAKESPEARE fur|ni&s;hed them with a peculiarity of &s;tyle; why then &s;hould we not &s;uppo&s;e he meant a peculiarity of deportment and utterance? He certainly did, as much as for Caliban; a languid propriety of na|tural expre&s;&s;ion de&s;troys in them, plea&s;ing and characteri&s;tic oddity&mdash;as to dre&s;&s;ing them in the Sybillic ta&s;te, it makes them rather Roman than Scots witches, and &s;acrifices e&s;tabli&s;hed national ideas, at the &s;hrine of fal&s;e decorum, for did appearance, ugly features, and advanced age, dub any female a witch in the times of credu|lity; even now, a very di&s;agreeable woman, bent with age, and wrapped in filthine&s;s, is &s;tigmatized with that title, though not &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly, north of the Tweed; nay, Macbeth him&s;elf &s;tiles them <HI>filthy</HI>

<P>Shocked as every man of real ta&s;te, feeling and genius mu&s;t be, at the predominance of tho&s;e dear-bought, une&s;&s;ential exotics, Italian operas, Gay re|&s;olved to exerci&s;e his unbounded talent of &s;atire again&s;t them; and that good &s;en&s;e, a little embit|tered, might go down with more fa&s;hionable gout, as apothecaries gild pills, he called in mu&s;ic to his aid, and &s;uch mu&s;ic too as was reli&s;hable by, not caviare to the million; thus, as we have read of an army, who defeated their enemies by &s;hoot|ing back upon them their own arrows, &s;o he &s;truck deep wounds into the emaciated <HI>&s;ignori</HI> of that time, by &s;hewing &s;uch &s;terling wit and humour as they were unacquainted with, decorated with the reigning ta&s;te of the day&mdash;the thought was happy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">ion equal to the de&s;ign, and the &s;ucce&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="127">In the very name of this piece, the author &s;eems to have i&s;&s;ued a keen &s;haft of ridicule, and making the author a beggar is a noble &s;arca&s;m on fortune and public ta&s;te, which have &s;uffered mo&s;t excellent ta|lents to pine under a thou&s;and di&s;advantages, of un|merited periury and even contempt: no one knew better than Gay the neglect which too commonly attends literary merit; he experienced, felt, and with great poignancy of expre&s;&s;ion declared it.</P>
<P>This piece opens with Jonathan Wild, the reign|ing thief-maker and thief-taker of that time, under the title of Peachum, peru&s;ing his tyburn-regi&s;ter; his &s;ong, in eight lines, contains more of the &s;pirit of truth and &s;atire than would animate &s;ome poems of eight &s;core; the &s;ucceeding &s;cene with Filch ex|hibits many excellent remarks, and his account of the gang, when looking out for proper &s;acrifices, is not only an admirable, but a very u&s;eful picture to the profligate; Mrs. Peachum's expre&s;&s;ions of plea|&s;ure, that there has been no murder committed for &s;ome time recommend her to favour; and Peach|um's replies &s;hewing what money will do in criminal pro&s;ecutions, is, we are afraid, too ju&s;t; mention of Macheath naturally falls in, and the &s;pectators are prepared to receive him, at lea&s;t, as an agreeable highwayman: his attachment to Polly comes aptly into the conver&s;ation, and the plot very pro|perly begins to dawn.&mdash;Speaking of Polly's being in love, Peachum di&s;covers a very &s;uitable &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, and where he remarks of what &s;ervice &s;he may be to him, by acting on political principles, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, as well as &s;ome preceding ones, glows

with &s;atiric meaning&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"My daughter to me &s;hould be, like a court-lady to a mini&s;ter of &s;tate, a key to the whole gang."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Peachum's &s;cene with Filch has nothing but &s;ome &s;trokes of low humour to recommend it, yet in that light is very &s;atisfactory, and always works a very laughable effect.</P>
<P>Polly is introduced by her father under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances as engage favour; her mother's vio|lent entrance is much in character; the fainting too, and the remedy for it, are powerful burle&s;ques on &s;imilar incidents to be met with in graver pieces; the daughter's &s;ilence on her marriage being di&s;|covered, is a very probable effect of confu&s;ion and apprehen&s;ion, nor does a word of the con&s;equent dialogue fail of due influence; the impatience of the parents, one through pride, the other through intere&s;t, give a fine opening for Polly's delicate, in|tere&s;ting apology, of a &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion, for the man &s;he has married; and Peachum's de&s;ign of taking off his new &s;on in-law, &s;eems the growth of a mind fortified again&s;t any feelings of humanity.</P>
<P>It is matter of wonder how &s;everal of our gay ladies and fine gentlemen can hear the following &s;peech without blu&s;hing con&s;cious guilt;
<Q REND="inline">"If &s;he had had only an intrigue with the fellow, why the very be&s;t families have excu&s;ed and huddled up an affair of that &s;ort; 'tis marriage, hu&s;|band, that makes it a blemi&s;h."</Q>
What Peach|um replies has a luxuriancy of merit,
<Q REND="inline">"But mo|ney, wife, is the true fuller's earth for reputa|tions; there is not a &s;pot or &s;tain but what it can

what brilliant, what general, what compacted &s;atire! mounted on the un&s;hakable ba|&s;is of truth, does this &s;hort &s;entence contain? How e&s;&s;entially &s;uperior to an a&s;&s;imilation of the &s;ame ingredients and Mr. Foote's plea&s;antry, in the pre|lude to Mr. Colman's Man and Wife, which dif|ference is only mentioned here to &s;hew how much the happy thought of one man of genius may be enervated by pa&s;&s;ing through the imagination of another.</P>
<P>The parents endeavouring to per&s;uade their daughter that an impeachment of the man &s;he loves, and is her hu&s;band al&s;o, mu&s;t recommend her to their favour, has &s;omething in it &s;hocking, yet affords a very engaging, pathetic tran&s;ition in Pol|ly's character; and her &s;oliloquy upon hearing, un|&s;een, the plan for Macheath's de&s;truction, de&s;erves much better delivery, much more expre&s;&s;ive fea|tures than it is in general favoured with&mdash;the breaks are fine, the &s;entiments tender, the de&s;cription lively, all dre&s;&s;ed in a naivet&eacute; of language, which finds a pa&s;&s;age to the heart, by nature's aid alone.</P>
<P>The hero is brought forward with great advan|tage, the bold &s;pirited &s;ymphony which introduces him, has a &s;imilar effect to tho&s;e flouri&s;hes of mar|tial mu&s;ic in &s;ome tragedies, and he comes very op|portunely to give the fir&s;t act additional life towards its conclu&s;ion; Polly's di&s;tre&s;s for his pre&s;ent danger, very naturally di&s;appears at the &s;ight and affectionate addre&s;s of her hu&s;band, but with equal propriety &s;oon returns again, with a varia|tion which plea&s;ingly touches the audience; his reluctance to fly, and her tender re&s;olution to part

for a time rather than hazard his &s;afety, rai&s;e deli|cate feelings.</P>
<P>As only the fir&s;t &s;ong has been particularized, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that to avoid repeti|tion as much as po&s;&s;ible, all the mu&s;ical part will be taken notice of in our general view of the piece, on clo&s;ing the remarks.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;cene of the &s;econd act we are pre|&s;ented with a &s;et of characters not at all re&s;pectable by profe&s;&s;ion, yet amu&s;ing, and &s;omewhat in&s;truc|tive from their conver&s;ation, which however we deem too full of &s;ound &s;en&s;e, and genteel, keen &s;atire for &s;uch per&s;onages&mdash;be&s;ides there are &s;ome &s;o|phi&s;tical ju&s;tifications of highwaymen, rather dan|gerous for di&s;&s;olute minds; in the drama this &s;hould be rarely meddled with, as natural vice gains more confirmation from delu&s;ive &s;hew and fal&s;e ar|guments, than natural virtue does from moral in|&s;truction &mdash;however, placing even thieves above courtiers in friendly attachments, as the author has judiciou&s;ly done in what follows, mu&s;t con&s;iderably palliate the objection we have rai&s;ed: one &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"Who is there here who would not the for his friend?"</Q> another replies, <Q REND="inline">"who is there here who would betray him for intere&s;t?"</Q> To which a third returns, <Q REND="inline">"Shew me a gang of courtiers who can &s;ay as much."</Q> 'Tis very plain from this, and many other inimitable pa&s;&s;ages, that our author knew courtiers in general exceeding well, whatever his knowledge of thieves might be.</P>
<P>Macheath's &s;hort interview with his gang means nothing more than acquainting them with the rea|&s;on
<PB N="119" REF="131">
of his di&s;appearance for &s;ome time, by Mat o'the Mint's mentioning Moorfields as the place of their rendezvous, we may learn that part of the town was then as reputable as &s;ome other &s;pots of it are at pre&s;ent.&mdash;What &s;ucceeds this &s;cene, pre|vious to the introduction of the ladies, and their conver&s;ation, however natural, are by no means proper for public repre&s;entation; the dialogue has great &s;pirit, and is enlivened by &s;everal &s;mart repar|tees, but the &s;ubject of action, and the characters are &s;o much founded upon licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as not to be defen&s;ible; improper prejudicial ideas mu&s;t ari&s;e, and we heartily condemn the whole from this prin|ciple, that vice is never more dangerous than when &s;he &s;miles, covering her deformities with a veil of plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>Indeed, apprehending Macheath in the mid&s;t of his jollity, by the treachery of two pro&s;titutes, may convey good warning to &s;ome who a&s;&s;ociate with &s;uch wretches; yet we are apt to think this &s;cene is more apt to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions than to correct the conduct of youth; and delicate ta&s;te mu&s;t be offended at many &s;entiments too gro&s;s for its tender reli&s;h.</P>
<P>Lockit's reception of Macheath, and his re|marks upon the fetters at different prices, &s;hew the gaoler in true, humourous, yet &s;hocking colours; it being a mi&s;erable perver&s;ion of ju&s;tice to treat culprits not according to the enormity of their crimes, but &s;trength of their pockets&mdash;the per|plexity of Macheath ari&s;ing from his apprehen&s;ion of Lucy's reproaches, falls well in, and her timely
<PB N="120" REF="132">
appearance confirms his fear; however, we mu&s;t again pa&s;s cen&s;ure upon our author for making Lucy &s;peak of her <HI>load</HI> of infamy, from a promi&s;e of marriage, and her jealou&s;y of Polly Peachum, the plot might have been &s;ufficiently wrought up with|out allu&s;ions &s;o very &s;en&s;ual, we mean with re&s;pect to the audience; Macheath's endeavouring to &s;ooth her into a good humour that they may &s;erve his particular purpo&s;e, though ungenerous, is polite and in character; the words which Lucy &s;peaks at go|ing off, <Q REND="inline">"I long to be made an hone&s;t woman,"</Q> are a &s;trong and plea&s;ant &s;troke of ridicule again&s;t tho&s;e who vainly imagine that virtue is comprized in any external ceremony, and that a mere com|pliance with e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom can &s;anctify vice.</P>
<P>The &s;atires which occur between Peachum and Lockit concerning their accounts, are ma&s;terly; and the &s;ong, which we cannot avoid quoting, inimitable:
<Q><L>When you cen&s;ure the age,</L>
<L>Be cautious and &s;age,</L>
<L>Le&s;t the courtiers offended &s;hould be:</L>
<L>If you mention vice or bribe,</L>
<L>'Tis &s;o pat to all the tribe,</L>
<L>That each cries that was levell'd at me.</L></Q></P>
<P>We have heard a &s;hort anecdote of Sir Robert Walpole, again&s;t whom Gay chiefly brandi&s;hed his pen, in re&s;pect of this &s;ong, which &s;hewed an agreeable and politic pre&s;ence of mind; being in the &s;tage-box, at the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of the opera, a mo&s;t univer&s;al encore attended Lockit's &s;ong, and all eyes at the &s;ame time were fixed on Sir Robert, who, noting the matter, joined heartily in the plaudit, and encored it a &s;econd time with his
<PB N="121" REF="133">
&s;ingle voice; which not only blunted the poetical &s;haft, but gained a general huzza from the au|dience.</P>
<P>The thief-taker and gaoler quarrelling upon a principle of honour, is al&s;o admirably &s;arca&s;tical upon tho&s;e known &s;coundrels who pretend a jea|lou&s;y for reputation, and who in&s;olently quarrel up|on principles they are totally unacquainted with&mdash; nothing is commoner than for pro&s;titutes to com|mence vehement burle&s;que altercations about virtue, and gamblers about hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>Lucy's interpo&s;ition with her father in favour of her gallant, and his obdurate refu&s;al, manife&s;t a &s;trict knowledge of nature, as does her determina|tion to effect the captain's freedom at any rate; no incident ever fell in more opportunely than Polly's entrance at this critical point of time; it reduces Macheath to a peculiar dilemma, and con|tra&s;ts the ladies very agreeably; their different feel|ings are expre&s;&s;ed with a degree of very nice di&s;tinc|tion, tenderne&s;s is well oppo&s;ed, by vehemence of affection, and the whole &s;cene furni&s;hes extreme agreeable action.&mdash;Polly's patience &s;o long under &s;uch circum&s;tances, and at la&s;t breaking out into womani&s;h re&s;entment, is a good delineation of a female mind, under &s;ome re&s;traint of delicacy, yet &s;u&s;ceptible of provocation upon tender points; the quarrel is well conceived, judiciou&s;ly conducted, and wrought into a humourous climax; the timely intervention of Peachum prevents actual ho&s;tilities, and cau&s;es a plea&s;ing touch of the pathetic; while Lucy's re&s;olution of &s;tealing her father's keys to give
<PB N="122" REF="134">
Macheath his liberty, puts expectation into a fre&s;h degree of &s;u&s;pence, and concludes the &s;econd act at a critical period.</P>
<P>A &s;uppo&s;ition of his daughter's connivance at the captain's e&s;cape, gives ri&s;e to Lockit's treating her &s;omewhat roughly at the beginning of the third act; but, in the true &s;pirit of corruption, which we may &s;tile <HI>ex officio,</HI> indeed the effect of his nature as well as place, he enquires for the per|qui&s;ite, and is not a little chagrined at finding the girl po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genero&s;ity.&mdash;In the &s;hort &s;ub&s;equent &s;cene, where Filch is introduced, we can by no means approve his gro&s;s an&s;wer to Lockit's ob&s;er|vation, that he looks like a &s;hotten herring, it is certainly only fit for the meridian of St. Giles's.</P>
<P>The character of a highwayman is well pre&s;erved in Macheath's making a gaming-hou&s;e his fir&s;t a&s;y|lum after enlargement, and fitting him up with oc|ca&s;ional finery of external appearance, &s;hews the author not only a judge of nature, but the &s;tage; for &s;uch &s;ort of collectors general aim at making a gallant figure, to appear what they are not, and change of dre&s;s often gives an actor &s;ome novelty with the audience; this &s;cene, however, imports little more than to &s;hew the di&s;&s;ipated turn of our hero.</P>
<P>Peachum, Lockit, and the tally-woman, Mrs. Dye Trapes, furni&s;h us with a di&s;h of conver&s;ation cen&s;urable throughout, though it always plea&s;es by the force of action; the &s;ubject is too mean for the public ear, the characters mentioned too de&s;picable for notice, except from the police, and the old
<PB N="123" REF="135">
lady's &s;ecrets, of her abominable trade, infamous; we would therefore recommend &s;ome other means of di&s;covering Macheath, and heartily wi&s;h a total omi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch &s;tuff as no per&s;on can learn any|thing from, which it would not be better to be ig|norant of.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of poi&s;oning Polly, in a gla&s;s of &s;trong waters, renders Lucy a right Newgate bird, and makes her, though the fact is not perpetrated, an object of dete&s;tation; and we apprehend unne|ce&s;&s;arily, unle&s;s we carry the idea of burle&s;que con&s;tantly in view, and con&s;ider the author as ri|diculing the poi&s;oned bowls of tragedy, &s;o often needle&s;sly admini&s;tered, and &s;o often miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped; another Billing&s;gate &s;entiment we find furni&s;hed to Lucy in this &s;cene, it comes imme|diately after the&s;e words,
<Q REND="inline">"I vow, Polly, I &s;hall take it mon&s;trou&s;ly ill, if you refu&s;e me."</Q></P>
<P>Macheath's appearing in cu&s;tody, &s;urprizes and alarms attention; his interview with the real and wou'd be wife is very expre&s;&s;ive of the circum|&s;tance, and good performance may call forth &s;ome drops of pity for a very unworthy object.&mdash;The different applications of the females, to their &s;everal fathers, call up tender &s;en&s;ations, but, we apprehend, they are rather mi&s;placed; for as Polly is certainly the leading character, and offers the mo&s;t pathetic addre&s;s, hers &s;hould have come la&s;t by way of cli|max.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible re&s;olution, and commendable, tho' divided, tenderne&s;s of Macheath, in his &s;ong as he goes off to the Old-Bailey, recommend him con&s;i|derably
<PB N="124" REF="136">
to favour, and are therefore artfully thrown in.</P>
<P>As Italian operas depend a good deal on dancing merit, we find Gay has a &s;troke even at that, by introducing a hop among the Newgate-gentry, to which, by way of making a &s;trange, yet &s;atirical medley, the condemned hole immediately &s;ucceeds; and, like other great men in &s;ome &s;erious pieces, the captain &s;ings through all weathers&mdash;high &s;pirits, low &s;pirits, love and de&s;pair; he has no le&s;s than ten airs to go through &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, yet &s;o judiciou&s;ly varied that he mu&s;t be a bitter bad vocal performer, in|deed, who palls his audience with them; the fol|lowing &s;hort &s;cenes between him and his friends, and that with the ladies, claim no great &s;hare of prai&s;e, nor do they merit any cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>That very unexpected turn the cata&s;trophe takes is thus apologized for by the beggar,
<Q REND="inline">"In this kind of drama, 'tis no matter how ab&s;urdly things are brought, about&mdash;&s;o you rabble there, run and cry a reprieve."</Q>
&mdash;Thus, by a kind of poetical, or rather operatical legerdemain, hey! pa&s;s! mi&s;ery is gone, and leaves joy and chearful|ne&s;s in its place.</P>
<P>To examine the plot of this piece by &s;trict rules of critici&s;m, as the author does not by any means pretend to regularity, would be too &s;evere; yet the unities are not gro&s;sly intruded upon, ex|cept in one place&mdash;there are but three-&s;hort &s;peeches and a dance between Macheath's being taken to trial and his appearing in the condemned hole, which could &s;carce happen till a day after at lea&s;t,
<PB N="125" REF="137">
as pri&s;oners, though found guilty, are not put there till after &s;entence.</P>
<P>The dialogue of this opera has great ea&s;e, &s;pirit and correctne&s;s; the &s;entiments are always ju&s;t, though &s;ometimes blameable; the &s;atire inimitable, and the &s;ongs without one exception, bating that of Mrs. Trapes, an unparalelled trea&s;ure of brilliant allu&s;ions, in&s;tructive ideas, &s;hrewd tendency, fa|miliar expre&s;&s;ion, and unaffected ver&s;ification: they have the plain outward &s;emblance of common bal|lads, yet teem with a luxuriance of imagination, truth and policy, mo&s;t amazingly compacted into an incredible narrow compa&s;s, which, in our e&s;ti|mation, entitles them to be &s;tiled the quinte&s;&s;ence of merit.</P>
<P>Yet after offering this impartial tribute at the &s;hrine of Gay's genius, it gives us concern to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of remarking, that a moral was the la&s;t point in his view, if it entered there at all; and, in this re&s;pect, a gloomy cloud ca&s;ts its dark &s;hade over the &s;hine of prai&s;e he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have commanded: if young minds, which indeed the mu&s;ic helps, leave a theatre untainted with any prejudicial impre&s;&s;ion after &s;eeing the BEGGAR's OPERA; if no fooli&s;h young per&s;on of either &s;ex admires Macheath as any other than a diverting &s;tage-character; if his &s;hew and fal&s;e courage do not delude the one &s;ex, nor his gallantry attract the other, then the piece may &s;tand as inoffen&s;ive; but we fear it does not often work an effect of &s;uch mediocrity, therefore are bold to call it a compo&s;i|tion
<PB N="126" REF="138">
made up of ingredients much more noxious than &s;alutary, &s;o plea&s;ingly reli&s;hed, &s;o flatteringly gilded, that &s;carce any eye or ta&s;te can re&s;i&s;t the powerful, dangerous temptation; it &s;tands, like light and heat, alluring pa&s;&s;ions, which play like moths around it, till they fall a prey to the delu|&s;ive object of their delight.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of characters, the men are all arrant &s;coundrels, and the females, except Polly, vicious jades; nece&s;&s;arily there can be but a very faint de|gree of light and &s;hade, which undoubtedly con|&s;titute not only a great part of dramatic beauty but propriety; for all angels, or all devils, is but a very partial, unin&s;tructive picture of human nature; but indeed our author's choice of characters would not admit of much variety, wherefore we heartily lament his pro&s;tituting &s;uch exqui&s;ite talents to &s;o unedifying, or rather immoral a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Macheath has &s;omething &s;pecious, but not one valuable &s;ymptom in his compo&s;ition; his profe&s;|&s;ion is not only to rob men of their property, but females of their characters and peace; there is an appearance of courage, without a &s;park of reality; for at the trying moment, we find he applies to the true re&s;ource of a coward, liquor; in &s;hort, he is a contemptible knave, yet an agreeable gallant, and therefore, as we have already ob&s;erved, the more dangerous and cen&s;urable for public exhibition.</P>
<P>In the performance of this part, &s;pirited bold|ne&s;s of figure, fla&s;hy gentility of deportment, and an expre&s;&s;ive, not a refined ta&s;te of &s;inging, are
<PB N="127" REF="139">
nece&s;&s;ary, under this idea of requi&s;ites, we cannot &s;ay that any performer within our knowledge has repre&s;ented him in a capital manner; Mr. BEARD's appearance and manner of &s;inging were all that could be wi&s;hed, but his &s;peaking was intolerable, and he appeared too much of the gentleman; Mr. LOWE's voice was more happy, but his expre&s;&s;ion le&s;s characteri&s;tic, and his &s;peaking, if po&s;&s;ible, wor&s;e; Mr. VERNON's mu&s;ical knowledge is ex|ten&s;ive, his merit in acting great, but his figure ra|ther inadequate, and his voice totally &s;o; Mr. MATTOCKS is far too faint in appearance and every degree of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the managers of Drury-lane would do them|&s;elves and the public ju&s;tice, Mr. BANNISTER, who looks, walks and &s;ings the part, take all together, &mdash;better than any who have been mentioned, &s;hould undoubtedly be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; and indeed of many others, which are mi&s;erably mutilated by the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.&mdash;Mr. DIGGES, whom we mentioned in our remarks upon Richard the Third, was not without great merit in the captain.</P>
<P>Peachum and Lockit are admirably drawn for their &s;tations, and with a very natural di&s;tinction; the former being more in the world, has more ex|tended ideas, more &s;hrewdne&s;s, and is a knave of greater latitude; Mr. MACKLIN and Mr. YATES were indi&s;putably &s;uperior to any competitors in the&s;e parts; but for general dryne&s;s and a ju&s;t cy|nical turn of humour, Mr. MACKLIN &s;tood, in
<PB N="128" REF="140">
our opinion foremo&s;t, at pre&s;ent it does not de|&s;erve notice at either hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Lockit is obvious and ea&s;y to hit, yet all we have &s;een never exceeded mediocrity; &s;ome &s;ink him into an ab&s;olute black-guard, which there is no rea&s;on for; and others &s;often the natural gloom of his &s;tation too much; the late Mr. BERRY was, we apprehend, the mo&s;t tolerable of any per&s;on for &s;everal years.&mdash;Filch is well de&s;ribed by the au|thor, and never was, nor never need be, better ex|pired than by Mr. PARSONS of Drury-lane, who, if it would not &s;eem an aukward compliment, looks, deports, and &s;ings the pickpocket to per|fection.</P>
<P>Polly is an agreeable young woman, imprudent, yet delicate, and con&s;tant in affection; &s;he com|mits a breach of filial duty, 'tis true, in point of her &s;ecret marriage, but &s;uch parents as hers appear to de&s;erve little confidence; no character in the drama has furni&s;hed &s;o many young adventurers as this, &s;everal of whom have made ample provi&s;ion for them&s;elves through her introduction into life; and, upon the whole, there never was a part in which &s;o many unequal performers made a tolera|ble &s;tand; out of a large number in our recollec|tion, the following ladies de&s;erved con&s;iderable prai&s;e, Mi&s;s NORRIS, Mi&s;s FALKNER, and Mrs. CHAMBERS.</P>

<HEAD>OTHELLO. Written by SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very much to be wi&s;hed that tragic writers would rather bend their thoughts to familiar cir|cum&s;tances in life, than tho&s;e which concern ele|vated feelings and ab&s;tract pa&s;&s;ions; the latter may indeed furni&s;h matter to genius of a dignified na|ture, but the former mo&s;t effectually appeal to ge|neral in&s;truction; thus we may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that though our author's Julius Cae&s;ar is equal to any piece, ancient or modern, for importance of &s;ub|ject, greatne&s;s of character, and liberality of &s;enti|ment, yet feebler efforts of genius carry in their nature and compo&s;ition a greater degree of &s;ocial utility; not that we con&s;ider the noble &s;pirit of pa|trioti&s;m, as too great or copious for any Briti&s;h bo|&s;om, at lea&s;t any hone&s;t one; but it is not &s;o re|lative to common dome&s;tic concerns, as many other feelings which work e&s;&s;ential advantage, or over|bearing mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Thus much we premi&s;e in favour of this tragedy, founded on that fever of the mind, jealou&s;y, which Doctor Young mo&s;t emphatically calls <Q REND="inline">"the Hydra of calamities;"</Q> a pa&s;&s;ion often ari&s;ing in every &s;ta|tion of life from &s;parks of inflammation, at fir&s;t &s;carce perceptible, into <Q REND="inline">"a conflagration of the &s;oul."</Q></P>
<P>OTHELLO commences with a &s;cene between Ro|dorigo and Iago, de&s;igned to let the audience know that the latter is chagrined at his general, the Moor,
<PB N="132" REF="144">
for not promoting him according to his de&s;ire, and that the former has a very affectionate tendre for the commander's new married lady; it appears plain that the amorous &s;impleton is made an ab&s;o|lute tool to the deep de&s;igns of Iago, who, not caring to appear him&s;elf as the Moor's enemy, &s;ets on the glib-tongued coxcomb to alarm Brabantio with the elopement of his daughter; this &s;cene is well written, but the pa&s;&s;ages, hereafter pointed at, are egregiou&s;ly offen&s;ive, and if performers will not voluntarily omit them, ought to be condemned into ob&s;curity, at lea&s;t from the &s;tage, by public re|pul&s;es.&mdash;Iago's &s;econd &s;peech to Brabantio under the window, beginning, <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you are robb'd,"</Q> is mo&s;t gro&s;sly conceived; and what immediately &s;uc|ceeds the&s;e words of the &s;ame character, if po&s;&s;ible, wor&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"becau&s;e we come to do you &s;ervice, you think us ruffians."</Q> Iago's departure, and leaving Ro|dorigo to be the old Senator's guide, is very politic.</P>
<P>Upon appearing, with Othello we find the dou|ble-dealing Ancient, working into Othello's confi|dence by &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to his inclination and intere&s;t; which prepares us for his future in&s;idious tran&s;actions, while the Moor's con|tempt of Brabantio's re&s;entment &s;hows that true dignified &s;ecurity of mind which con&s;cious inno|cence be&s;tows&mdash;the following &s;cenes, till the appears before the &s;enate, are rather trifling, &s;ave that a me&s;&s;age from the &s;tate &s;aves Othello the di&s;grace of going as a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The &s;enate &s;cene has ever been deemed an impor|tant one, and indeed with con&s;iderable ju&s;tice;
<PB N="133" REF="145">
the paternal feelings of Brabantio, and the generous confidence of Othello, are well &s;upported; but the charge of gaining De&s;demona by &s;pells and medi|cines, however con&s;onant to a Venetian law, again&s;t &s;uch practices, we could wi&s;h had been rejected by our author, for the &s;ame rea&s;on we have urged again&s;t witches; the great probability of &s;uch characters, and chimerical notions impre&s;&s;ing irrational ideas up|on weak minds; indeed Brabantio's rea&s;on for &s;up|po&s;ing that his daughter could not have been won by any fair means to a match &s;o &s;eemingly prepo&s;t|erous, is &s;trong, but not a &s;ufficient apology for his charge, which &s;hows him, like &s;ome modern &s;e|nators, to be none of the wi&s;e&s;t&mdash;King James wrote a book of Demonology, but can any man in his &s;en&s;es call it a rational, though a royal production.</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t addre&s;s to the &s;enate, we perceive the Moor apologizing with all the &s;moothne&s;s and flow of eloquence for his deficiency in that re&s;pect, he is nervous, conci&s;e, and figurative, therefore his mode&s;t opinion of him&s;elf &s;eem &s;trong &s;ymptoms of affecta|tion, we find Brabantio in his reply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the true old womani&s;h, credulous ob&s;tinacy, &s;tick|ing clo&s;e to conjuration, which indeed the duke very properly reproves.</P>
<P>Othello's narration, though literally fine, &s;ub|jects him to an imputation of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency; that he might relate his &s;tory for the entertainment of De&s;demona, and that &s;he might conceive an affec|tion for one concerned in &s;o many great and intere&s;t|ing events, is very con&s;i&s;tent with him as a polite warrior, and with her as an admirer of military
<PB N="134" REF="146">
atchievements, ri&s;ing almo&s;t into the &s;train of ro|mance; but for the Moor to aim &s;o much at reca|pitulation of what mu&s;t be known to mo&s;t, if not all of the &s;tate&s;men who employed him as a general &s;hews as if Shake&s;peare unbridled fancy, and &s;tudied more giving the performer a fine &s;peech, than pre|&s;erving delicacy of character, yet whatever objec|tion we rai&s;e is much, if not entirely &s;oftened, by the great plea&s;ure it always gives in recital.</P>
<P>De&s;demona's appearance, and candid declaration in favour of the Moor, gives a very &s;atisfactory re|futation to her father's my&s;terious allegations; what follows, concerning Cyprus, we can by no means &s;ee any nece&s;&s;ity for; as every part of the plot might have been pre&s;erved with equal force, by keeping the characters all through at Venice; we have de|clared our&s;elves &s;o uncla&s;&s;ical as not to be the friends of &s;trict limitation, but cannot countenance the introduction of a &s;ea-voyage, where there is no occa&s;ion for it: Othello might have appeared as much in his military capacity, by receiving orders to make di&s;po&s;itions at home again&s;t a Turki&s;h in|va&s;ion, as by going abroad.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing &s;cene between Iago and Rodorigo &s;hews the former in a more extended light of knave|ry, and his manner of working upon the &s;hallow &s;opling is happily executed; however we can by no means approve &s;uch a character as Rodorigo in tragical compo&s;ition; he is only to be laughed at, and that cannot be deemed a proper feeling for &s;erious pieces; be&s;ides, through the whole, he is literally a non-e&s;&s;ential, and as he &s;ays him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that he is not a hound that hunts, but one that
<PB N="135" REF="147">
"fills up the cry;"&mdash;would he were &s;tationed more &s;uitably, not only becau&s;e he di&s;graces more important concerns by his levity, but al&s;o becau&s;e his conferences with Iago are upon an offen&s;ive &s;ub|ject, and furni&s;h many nau&s;eous ideas, &s;et forth in gro&s;s expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Iago's &s;oliloquy, which concludes the fir&s;t act, is a ma&s;ter-piece of villainous machination, finely written for a judicious actor, and very artfully throws out his chief motive of re&s;entment again&s;t the general; but if his expre&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y had been more obliquely worded, it would have been more commendable.</P>
<P>It is very judicious to retrench con&s;iderably tho&s;e trifling &s;cenes at the beginning of the &s;econd act; but why the following &s;peeches of Montano and a gentleman &s;hould be omitted I know not, &s;ince a &s;torm is mentioned, nothing could be put in their mouths, as &s;pectators of di&s;tracted elements, more natural, or more con&s;i&s;tently poetical, than the&s;e lines;</P>

<P><PB N="136" REF="148">Had the preceding pa&s;&s;ages belonged to capital characters, they would have been carefully retained; but in theatrical paring it &s;eems a rule, to render the &s;maller parts as incon&s;iderable as po&s;&s;ible, from a paltry, &s;elfi&s;h notion, that thereby they become a better foil to the principal ones; this makes prompters books &s;uch mi&s;erable, multilated objects, as they are in many places, and at the &s;ame time wrongs both the author and public ta&s;te; be&s;ides, the preceding &s;peeches are ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to rai&s;e a preparative anxiety for the &s;afety of Othello.</P>
<P>Iago's treatment of Aemilia, and his reflections on wives in general, not only before &s;trangers, but even before De&s;demona, is brutally unpolite; a mi|&s;erable &s;hift to give time for Othello's arrival; be|&s;ides, the line after this,
<Q REND="inline">"Nay, it is true, or el&s;e I am a Turk,"</Q>
admits no ju&s;tification; yet is retained in &s;peaking by the &s;ame wi&s;e authorities which exclude the above quotation, &s;o pregnant with beautiful propriety.&mdash;The la&s;t line of a former &s;peech is al&s;o ful&s;ome; it comes after this, <Q REND="inline">"Saints in your injuries&mdash;devils being offended;"</Q> and all the ancient's poetical reflections have a <HI>mo&s;t plenti|ful lack</HI> of de&s;irable meaning; they do indeed ve|rify his own remark of <HI>coming forth brains</HI> and all; to be plain, the whole of this &s;cene, till Iago's remarks on De&s;demona's freedom with Ca&s;&s;io, is either trifling or abominable; what depravity of imagination could tempt Shake&s;peare to introduce the words in Iago's &s;ide-&s;peech after the&s;e,
<Q REND="inline">"Your fingers to your lips,"</Q>
it is impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive; for they are not only indecent, but other|wi&s;e improper, as they imply an unea&s;ine&s;s at the
<PB N="137" REF="149">
favour &s;hewn Ca&s;&s;io, which &s;hould rather plea&s;e him, as it apparently works for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Othello's entrance relieves and charms attention after &s;o in&s;ipid an interval; the rapture of meeting &s;afe, after mutual danger, is expre&s;&s;ed equal to every idea ari&s;ing from affection of heart, and fire of imagination, and the interview gives more &s;atis|faction to the &s;en&s;ibility, by being made judiciou&s;ly &s;hort.</P>
<P>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of &s;entiment again prevails unpar|donably between Iago and Rodorigo, even &s;o much as to &s;hame quotation; indeed, to do the &s;tage ju&s;|tice, this &s;cene is much and commendably curtailed in repre&s;entation; Iago's policy and method of working up Rodorigo, to quarrel with Ca&s;&s;io, &s;peak an able genius for mi&s;chief; his &s;ub&s;equent &s;oliloquy offers &s;ome palliation of his ba&s;ene&s;s, by harping again upon the &s;tring of jealou&s;y, and opens his future views more at large; upon his going off the author has introduced a herald to proclaim fe&s;ti|vity, and we pre&s;ume not improperly, however the theatres reject him.</P>
<P>Bringing Othello and De&s;demona, for no other rea&s;on than to give Ca&s;&s;io charge of the court watch, which a general never does in &s;uch a manner to his inferior officer, is trifling with the Moor's impor|tance, and makes his return during the quarrel, too improbably &s;udden; Iago's inflammatory &s;peeches to Ca&s;&s;io re&s;pecting De&s;demona, and the con&s;um|mation of the Moor's nuptials, are far too lu&s;cious for e&s;&s;ential public re&s;erve, or even delicate privacy
<PB N="138" REF="150">
&mdash;the manner of working up the quarrel, the quar|rel it&s;elf, and the drunkenne&s;s of Ca&s;&s;io, are violent intru&s;ions upon the decorum of tragedy.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;io, like a tame gudgeon, &s;wallows the bait laid for him, as ea&s;ily as any de&s;igning knave could wi&s;h, and makes as fooli&s;h a figure as any hot-headed in|ebriated fool we have met with: we don't &s;ay that nature's bounds are at all violated, but we con|ceive &s;uch pictures unworthy the more delicate and ma&s;terly beauties of this piece: if any thing can pal|liate critical re&s;entment, it mu&s;t be the re&s;pectable figure that Othello makes in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the riot; Iago's able hypocri&s;y, which artfully criminates the friend he &s;eems to excu&s;e; and Ca&s;&s;io's inimitable reflections when he is, rather miraculou&s;ly, re&s;tored to rea&s;on; Iago's urging him to &s;ue for his place again, through De&s;demona's influence, is a deep and &s;en&s;ible train laid, full of &s;eeming advantage, fraught with perils and death; his turning the ea&s;y, bene|volent di&s;po&s;ition of De&s;demona into the materials of ruin for her&s;elf and Ca&s;&s;io, is the very e&s;&s;ence of diabolical contrivance,&mdash;Rodorigo's entrance &s;eems calculated for no other purpo&s;e than to keep him in &s;ome degree of remembrance, but Iago's conclu|&s;ion of the act, &s;hews intricate complication, and great depth of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>From &s;everal &s;cenes &s;cattered through our author's plays, we are apt to imagine he trifled with propri|ety to relax his genius, what el&s;e could give birth to what we meet at the beginning of the third act, a clown, bandying &s;trange quibbles, and quaint con|ceits,

the beloved object's ab&s;ence, than weakly or flat|teringly to her face; Iago's di&s;tant, &s;ubtle entrance upon the grand part of his de&s;ign, is admirable, as is indeed the whole progre&s;s of this &s;cene, wherein Othello &s;hews much openne&s;s of temper and warmth of heart, both which his in&s;idious ancient works on with great judgment and propriety; the doubs he rai&s;es with &s;uch hypocrital diffidence are judici|ou&s;ly &s;ugge&s;ted, and Othello's impatient curio&s;ity extremely natural; Iago's reflections upon the &s;u|perior value of a good name, to riches, are &s;o well known, that quoting them would be &s;uperfluous&mdash; his picture of jealou&s;y al&s;o is amazingly &s;triking, and Othello's generous di&s;dain on being &s;uppo&s;ed ca|papable of &s;o illiberal a pa&s;&s;ion, mo&s;t nobly expre&s;|&s;ed&mdash;how peculiarly plea&s;ing, nay in&s;tructive, is his &s;peech to that purpo&s;e? we mu&s;t pre&s;ent it to the candid reader:

<P>Where he is de&s;cribing Ca&s;&s;io's dream, the pic|ture is drawn in much too glaring colours; the painting need not have been &s;o &s;trong for a man of Othello's apparent quick conception and delicate &s;en&s;ibility; the handkerchief is extremely well in|troduced, and Othello's dreadful re&s;olution, what might be rea&s;onably expected from a precipitate, vindictive temper, perplexed with &s;uch violent ex|tremes; however, we cannot approve the a&s;&s;imila|tion of his re&s;olution to the Pontic &s;ea, which never feels an ebb; though the thought is beautiful it &s;uits not the circum&s;tance of character.</P>
<P>Why Aemilia, in the &s;hort &s;cene with De&s;demona, where Shake&s;peare has again produced his facetious, word catching clown, &s;hould throw out a hint of Othello's being jealous, or why his wife &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t a thought of jealou&s;y of him, merely for lo&s;ing an handkerchief, though a particular one, is not ea&s;y to account for; the re-entrance of Othello, teeming with confirmed rage, fills us with anxious expectation, and his being confined to the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of the handkerchief &s;hows that our author knew how to make the &s;malle&s;t matters im|portant; yet we know not for what rea&s;on magic &s;hould be placed in the web of it, unle&s;s to &s;tartle De&s;demona, and to give the author an opportunity of indulging his fancy in &s;ome fine lines; De&s;de|mona's

<P>The following &s;peech of Aemilia is liable to two objections; as the fir&s;t line &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to proclaim a gro&s;s breach of time, and next as tho&s;e which come after exhibit a nau&s;eous allu&s;ion.</P>

<L>The eat us hungrily&mdash;and, when they're full,</L>
<L><HI>They belch us</HI> up again.</L></Q>
<P>As to the inference drawn from the fir&s;t line by &s;ome critics, that it places Othello's nuptials &s;o far back as one of the periods therein mentioned, is, we apprehend, a &s;trained interpretation; for, if the lady who plays Aemilia lays any empha&s;is on the two marked words, and expre&s;&s;es the la&s;t mo&s;t forceably&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"'Tis not a <HI>year</HI> or <HI>two</HI> &s;hews us a man,"</Q>
&mdash;then the &s;en&s;e is obviou&s;ly this; How can you, who have been &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace married, think of knowing the turns of a man's temper, which requires even years to explain? The fol|lowing &s;cene, where Iago and Ca&s;&s;io are concerned, has nothing material in it, unle&s;s &s;hewing more goodne&s;s of heart in De&s;demona and more hypo|cri&s;y in Iago, who artfully &s;eems to wonder at the &s;torm him&s;elf has rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>After this &s;cene, which properly concludes the third act, as it is played, Shake&s;peare brings in a mere excre&s;cence of the plot, Bianca, Ca&s;&s;io's cour|tezan,
<PB N="145" REF="159">
of whom, being totally excluded from the &s;tage, we &s;hall &s;ay no more than expre&s;s wonder how the author could incumber his piece with &s;uch a de&s;picable non-e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>As if the Moor had not been &s;ufficiently wrought up, which certainly he has been Shake&s;peare, for &s;e|veral pages at the beginning of the fourth act, la|boriou&s;ly, and from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages we may add, in a bea&s;tly manner, endeavours to throw fre&s;h fuel on his flames, extending the matter to &s;uch a length as action could not render &s;ufferable, and in many places tending to the ridiculous; wherefore, we would recommend omi&s;&s;ion of every line which pre|cedes&mdash;"Get me &s;ome poi&s;on, Iago;" the &s;pace of time &s;ince we have &s;een Othello before, and the temper he la&s;t appeared in, &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify his coming on here, fixed in the re&s;olution of &s;acrificing his wife.</P>
<P>Lodovico appears, deputed by the &s;tates of Ve|nice on a very odd errand, no le&s;s than di&s;placing Othello from the government of Cyprus, and &s;ub|&s;tituting Ca&s;&s;io in his room; our author knew little of, or would not under&s;tand any &s;ort of, mili|tary regulation, when he could rai&s;e a &s;imple lieu|tenant at once to be governr of an i&s;land, which was thought worthy the care of the general in chief, as we have rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing Othello to be; indeed, we can perceive no u&s;e for the new character of Lodovico; however the &s;cene, where he fir&s;t comes on, gives great &s;cope of natural and powerful action in Othello, who&s;e jealou&s;y pre|dominates over every other con&s;ideration; Iago's
<PB N="146" REF="160">
giving a bad impre&s;&s;ion of him to Lodovico, is much in character.</P>
<P>Othello's &s;ounding of Aemilia is very &s;uitable, and his following interview, with De&s;demona, melt|ingly pathetic. Iago's viperous heart is rendered, if po&s;&s;ible, more odious by his pretended concern for De&s;demona's pitiable &s;ituation, and the miff between him and Aemilia ri&s;es well, to &s;hew her re&s;i&s;tive &s;pi|rit in contra&s;t to the gentlene&s;s of her mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash; After De&s;demona has made an intere&s;ting exculpa|tory appeal to Heaven, the ladies give place to Ro|dorigo, who, finding him&s;elf dallied with, upbraids Iago with &s;ini&s;ter dealings; as we wi&s;hed from the beginning, not to &s;ee this di&s;graceful mu&s;hroom of tragedy, we &s;hall only &s;ay of this &s;cene, that it &s;erves the intended purpo&s;e well enough.</P>
<P>The Moor is pre&s;ented to view, at his next en|trance, in quite a different mode of behaviour, he is determined on his great revenge, the plan is laid, and therefore very naturally, he wears a partial calm, in external appearance, which is like that ge|nerally proceeding the elementary &s;hock of an earth|quake, the prologue of more a&s;&s;ured and terrible de&s;truction; if De&s;demona was to chaunt the la|mentable ditty, and &s;peak all that Shake&s;peare has allotted for her in this &s;cene, an audience, as Foi|gard &s;ays, would not know whether to laugh or cry; and Aemilia's quibbling di&s;&s;ertation on cuckold-making, is contemptible to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The fifth act commences with Iago appointing Rodorigo to the honourable po&s;t of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, which we think &s;omewhat like placing a &s;erpent's
<PB N="147" REF="161">
&s;ting in the tail of a butterfly; a &s;trange jumble of events en&s;ue, amid&s;t which Iago plays at bo-peep with murder, and &s;ecures the poor coxcomb he has robbed, by privately &s;tabbing him; the introduc|tion of Othello at a window is quite &s;uperfluous, and indeed all the&s;e tran&s;actions might have been re|ferred more properly to narration, which would, nay does, fall very naturally in at the unravelling of the plot: we own our&s;elves de&s;irous of having the fifth act begin with the bed &s;cene; and what Aemilia leaves untold of the fray, would come extremely well from Ca&s;&s;io: If the whole was done as SHAKE|SPEARE wrote it, and Bianca produced howling over her gallant, the &s;cene would be intolerable; even as it is, much &s;hortened, it rather intrudes up|on material feelings.</P>
<P>There is &s;omewhat affectingly &s;olemn in De&s;de|mona's &s;ituation, and Othello's appearance when &s;he is in bed; pity never received a more powerful call than to &s;ee &s;leeping innocence at the brink of de&s;truction; nor did her tender ear ever catch &s;ounds more pathetically intere&s;ting, than Othello's reflec|tions previous to her waking; every &s;oft &s;en&s;ation is put into a tremulative &s;tate, and the &s;u&s;ceptible &s;pectator mu&s;t feel an exqui&s;ite &s;hare of painful plea&s;ure, to &s;ee a determined murderer, who moves us more to compa&s;&s;ion than dete&s;tation, which lat|ter &s;hould attend &s;uch actions, &s;hews that our author had when he plea&s;ed, an almo&s;t magic power over the human heart, and could place the pa&s;&s;ions up|on rea&s;on's throne.&mdash;No conver&s;ation was ever more in nature, than what pa&s;&s;es between the Moor and
<PB N="148" REF="162">
his wife: every half line, for brevity of expre&s;&s;ion, is mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly adopted, and recommends <HI>him</HI> to our favour, without making <HI>her</HI> le&s;s pitiable.</P>
<P>The act of murder is &s;ucceeded by a mo&s;t beau|tiful wilderne&s;s of confu&s;ion; nothing could be more happily fancied than Aemilia's approach at &s;uch a cri&s;is; the &s;cene with her al&s;o is carried on with pe|culiar &s;pirit and propriety&mdash;the revival of De&s;de|mona from a &s;tate of &s;uffocation, and her expiring without any fre&s;h violence, we apprehend to be ra|ther ab&s;urd, therefore highly approve Othello's &s;tab|bing her with a dagger, after the words&mdash;"I that am cruel," drawing blood accounts naturally for gaining power of &s;peech, and may yet be mortal&mdash; &s;peaking of Ca&s;&s;io's freedom with his wife, the Moor u&s;es &s;ome very gro&s;s expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;all the re|mainder of this act exhibits an intere&s;ting train of explanations, which, though already known to the audience, plea&s;e, as they lead to &s;trict poetical ju&s;|tice; however, Othello's violent exclamation, be|ginning, <Q REND="inline">"whip me ye devils,"</Q> is rather bomba&s;|tical and profane&mdash;Aemilia's death is quite unne|ce&s;&s;ary, as it cannot tend to render Iago more de|te&s;table than he is already, nor has &s;he done any thing to merit puni&s;hment&mdash;wherefore it &s;eems as if SHAKESPEARE's tragic mu&s;e determined, like Re|nault in Venice Pre&s;erved, to &s;pare neither &s;ex nor age, and rejoiced, as Mr. Cumberland has it in his inimitable prologue of all prologues to the Bro|thers, to appear
<Q>From &s;houlder to the flank all drench'd in gore.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="163">Notwith&s;tanding &s;uicide is a real act of coward|ice, an irrational and an irreligious e&s;cape from men|tal pain, yet we can hardly blame Othello for apply|ing that de&s;perate remedy to &s;uch complicated woes; and there is &s;omething very noble in reminding the &s;tate of Venice with almo&s;t his la&s;t words, that he fini&s;hed his life in the &s;ame manner which he had once u&s;ed to vindicate the public honour of his ma&s;ters; Iago is mo&s;t properly denoted to utter contempt as well as abhorrence, and re&s;erving him for legal puni&s;hment in its utmo&s;t &s;everity, is more con&s;onant to poetical ju&s;tice, than adding him to the heap of the &s;lain would have been; it was ex|tremely judicious al&s;o to wrap up the whole in one &s;peech after Othello's death.</P>
<P>This tragedy, upon the whole, contains many pa&s;&s;ages &s;ublimely beautiful, a number very trifling, &s;ome ab&s;urd, and too many licentious, we mean as written by Shake&s;peare&mdash;except tran&s;porting the characters from Venice to Cyprus, which might have ea&s;ily been avoided; the plan is &s;ufficiently regular, plea&s;ingly progre&s;&s;ive, and well calculated to touch mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly the feelings of horror and pity; the per&s;onages are well contra&s;ted, and co|operate properly to the main action, though Rodo|rigo, Bianca, and the clown, di&s;grace their company much; the &s;tage, however, has bani&s;hed two of them, and if the third was con&s;igned to oblivion, it would be for the author's credit.</P>
<P>Indeed it is to be wi&s;hed, that in&s;tead of &s;o many &s;yllable hunting editions of Shake&s;peare as have ap|peared; a committee of able critics had united their
<PB N="150" REF="164">
abilities to &s;trike out the in&s;ignificant and offen&s;ive pa&s;&s;ages which &s;o often occur; this would bring his merit into a more compact, uniform view, and con|&s;iderably le&s;&s;en the heavy public tax, ari&s;ing from extending his works, at lea&s;t three volumes more than are creditable to him&s;elf, or u&s;eful to his readers; &s;uch an edition regulated by all tho&s;e already pub|li&s;hed, without the incumbrance of multiplied, con|jectural notes, unle&s;s there are very ob&s;cure allu&s;ions, if prepared by impartial ability, would be an accep|table offering to delicate ta&s;te, and mu&s;t, we appre|hend, meet what it would certainly de&s;erve, general &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;&s;uch a work we could cordially recommend to Mr. GARRICK, and &s;uch &s;uitable a&s;&s;i&s;tants as his exten&s;ive connexions in the literary world mu&s;t ea&s;ily procure him&mdash;we hope what is here offered will be con&s;idered as a hint only, founded on united regard for the father of the drama, the delicate dignity of the &s;tage, and the morals of readers as well as auditors.</P>
<P>Othello, though he does not require all the powers of tragical expre&s;&s;ion, certainly calls for &s;everal of the greate&s;t&mdash;he is open; generous, free, &s;ubject to vio|lent feelings, not, as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>ea&s;ily jea|lous,</HI> yet rouzed by that pernicious pa&s;&s;ion above all violent re&s;traint; weak in his confidence, partial in di&s;cernment, fatal in re&s;olution&mdash;if we may venture to &s;ay, that any performer ever was born for one part, in particular, it mu&s;t have been Mr. BARRY for the Moor; his figure was a good apology for De&s;demona's attachment, even if &s;he had not &s;een a fair, in&s;tead of black vi&s;age in his mind, and the
<PB N="151" REF="165">
of his voice to tell &s;uch a tale as he de&s;cribes, mu&s;t have rai&s;ed favourable prejudice in any one who had an ear, or heart to feel.</P>
<P>There is a length of periods, and an extravagance of pa&s;&s;ion, in this part, not to be found in any other, for &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;cenes, to which which Mr. BARRY appeared peculiarly &s;uitable, he happily ex|hibited the hero, the lover, and the di&s;tracted hu&s;|&s;band; he ro&s;e through all the pa&s;&s;ions to the ut|mo&s;t extent of critical imagination, yet &s;till appear|ed to leave an unexhau&s;ted fund of expre&s;&s;ion be|hind; his rage and tenderne&s;s were equally inte|re&s;ting, but when he uttered the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"rude am I in my &s;peech,"</Q> in tones, <HI>as &s;oft as feathered &s;now that melted as they fell,</HI> we could by no means allow the &s;ound an echo to the &s;en&s;e&mdash;though we are not at all fond of this gentleman's action in general, yet, re&s;pecting both it and attitude, particularly when called by Aemilia after the murder, he was in this character extremely agreeable.</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN&mdash;we are &s;orry to mention him &s;o often di&s;advantageou&s;ly&mdash;was&mdash;though Othello is in the vale of years, not a very probable external appear|ance to engage De&s;demona; his declamation was as heavy as his per&s;on, his tones monotonous, his pa&s;|&s;ions bellowing, his empha&s;is affected, and his under &s;trokes growling&mdash;we remember once to have &s;een this e&s;teemed performer play the Moor, in a large pow|dered major wig, which, with the black face, made &s;uch a magpye appearance of his head, as tended greatly to laugher; one &s;troke, however, was not
<PB N="152" REF="166">
ami&s;s, coming on in white gloves, by pulling off which the black hands became more realized.</P>
<P>Mr. ROSS and Mr. POWELL were pretty much on a footing in this part; the former figured it bet|ter, and &s;poke mo&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ages as well; but the latter appealed more to the heart, and wore the pa&s;|&s;ions with natural grace; however, both were very far &s;hort of that capital merit a London audience have a right to expect.</P>
<P>If it was po&s;&s;ible for &s;pectators to be plea&s;ed with meaning alone, uttered through very ungracious, inadequate organs, Mr. SHERIDAN might &s;tand high in public e&s;timation; but execution being as nece&s;&s;ary as conception, we can only afford him the prai&s;e of barren propriety.</P>
<P>Iago is excellently drawn as a &s;low, &s;ubtle, ira&s;ci|ble villain, dead to every good, or tender feeling, mean, hypocritical and vindictive, ba&s;e enough to do any bad action underhand, but void of re&s;olution to avow or vindicate his wickedne&s;s&mdash;to paint this complicate, we may add mon&s;trous, character hap|pily in repre&s;entation, is by no means ea&s;y; Mr. RYAN in his plau&s;ibility and ea&s;e was very com|mendable, but uppeared greatly deficient in de&s;ign: Mr. SPARKS was heavy and laborious, Mr. SHERI|DAN is excellent in the &s;oliloquies, but void of ea&s;e and in&s;inuation in the dialogue; Mr. HOLLAND hunting after a meaning he never found, and Mr. LEE crowds in a multitude of meanings the author never intended; thus we introduce Mr. MACKLIN to an indi&s;putable pre-eminence for under&s;tanding the part as well, and expre&s;&s;ing it through the whole
<PB N="153" REF="167">
with more equal and &s;uitable merit, than any other performer we have &s;een; and this we do not ad|vance upon private opinion, but from comparative views of the effect wrought by him and others upon various audiences: to couch our prai&s;e in very odd terms, he has got the indi&s;putable, involuntary ap|plau&s;e of as many cur&s;es in Iago, as in Shylock.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;io is a very amiable, but, except his drunken &s;cene which we e&s;teem di&s;graceful to tragedy, a very unintere&s;ting per&s;onage: the late Mr. PALMER did him great ju&s;tice, and the pre&s;ent Mr. PALMER, a ri&s;ing young actor, does not fall much behind in execution; to which is added the advantage of a much more &s;oldier-like appearance, a per&s;on much better framed to make women fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The babbling hound Rodorigo receives con&s;ide|rable plea&s;antry from Mr. DYER; but if it is not pro&s;tituting Mr. KING's &s;terling merit, to mention him fir&s;t in &s;uch a part, we mu&s;t give him the lead, and &s;ay, that if the reptile can be made &s;uffer|able, it is by his performance; which, equal to &s;ome very arduous ta&s;ks, can neverthele&s;s when occa&s;ion calls conde&s;cend agreeably, and make trifles intere&s;ting; this is no &s;mall point of prai&s;e, for many capital actors, thinking a character beneath their dignity, throw contempt on it and the audience; but Mr. KING's great good &s;en&s;e and re&s;pect for the public, prevents him from &s;o ridiculous a &s;tart of vanity&mdash;I wi&s;h every theatrical gentleman would follow the excellent example, and, comparatively &s;peaking, take as much pains with two or three lengths, as two or three and twenty.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="168">Brabantio, while concerned, is of &s;ome importance though his complaint is rather childi&s;h; yet even the weak tears of a father claim re&s;pect, and call upon general &s;ympathy, as they &s;pring from the fair foun|tain of paternal affection: Mr. BERRY, though blub|bering in grief was his characteri&s;tic fault, &s;tood well in this part; we have had the anxiety to &s;ee Mr. ANDERSON murder, and the pain to hear that co&s;|tive tragedian Mr. LOVE growl it forth, but never wi&s;h to feel &s;uch intellectual mi&s;ery again.</P>
<P>De&s;demona is a part of no &s;hining qualifications, every point of &s;atisfaction that can ari&s;e from her unvarying gentlene&s;s, and more than critici&s;m could claim, may be enjoyed from Mrs. BARRY, who looks and expre&s;&s;es it much better than Mrs. YATES, to whom al&s;o we mu&s;t prefer, &s;ome years ago, Mrs. BELLAMY in this character.</P>
<P>Aemilia has much more life than her mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;hews a well contra&s;ted &s;pirit; Mrs. HOPKINS does not fall &s;hort of our wi&s;hes, and we remember to have received &s;ome plea&s;ure from that uncultivated genius Mrs. HAMILTON in repre&s;enting her.</P>
<P>To offer a general opinion of this tragedy, we deem it, properly retrenched, a mo&s;t noble enter|tainment on the &s;tage, and a luxurious, yet whole|&s;ome fea&s;t for the clo&s;et; it rather wants bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore in &s;ome places lies heavy on action, but it keeps an excellent moral in view, and forceably inculcates it all along; the fatal effects of jealou&s;y; by well wrought pa&s;&s;ions, elevated &s;entiments, and a dreadful cata&s;trophe, &s;hewing the very dangerous
<PB N="155" REF="169">
con&s;equences of indulging, even upon the mo&s;t probable proofs, &s;uch pernicious, ungovernable pre|judices in the human heart.</P>
<P>Having, through unaccountable lap&s;e of me|mory, forgot to mention Mr. MOSSOP, both in this tragedy and Macbeth, it is hoped the reader will accept our opinion of that gentleman here, though not in the regular cour&s;e of our plan&mdash;no performer in our remembrance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a voice of more &s;trength and variety than Mr. MOSSOP, and we believe he under&s;tands his author as well as any one, yet an in&s;uperable aukwardne&s;s of action, and a mo&s;t irk&s;ome laboriou&s;ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, render him peculiarly offen&s;ive to cha&s;te judgment in Macbeth; a number of unlucky attempts at attitude, ungrace|ful di&s;tortions of feature, an over&s;trained affectation of con&s;equence, and many ill-applied painful pau&s;es, bani&s;hing nature, loudly proclaim the mere actor&mdash; in Othello, though liable to &s;everal of the &s;ame objections, we deem him much happier; the Moor's wildne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion he de&s;cribes extremely well, and under all di&s;advantages mo&s;t certainly &s;tands &s;econd to, though far beneath, Mr. BARRY.</P>

<P>The entrance of ju&s;tice Woodcock is very charac|teri&s;tic, affords a good variation of circum&s;tance, and throws the lovers into an unexpected dilemma; Lucinda's device to impo&s;e upon the old gentleman, though not at all new, is at lea&s;t well adapted; the &s;elf-&s;ufficient magi&s;trate's abrupt treatment of Eu|&s;tace, before he knows any thing of him, is a natural con&s;equence of ignorant pride buoyed up with a commi&s;&s;ion of the peace; and that very pride mak|ing him enter into a contradictory altercation with his preci&s;e &s;i&s;ter, produces very humorous effects, and indeed u&s;eful ones to the young pair who are &s;heltered by the very pains Mrs. Deborah takes to defeat their happine&s;s; this is making a whim&s;ical, and very natural u&s;e of the ju&s;tice's oddity; if any per&s;on would wi&s;h a more laughable &s;cene than this their ri&s;ible faculties mu&s;t be unu&s;ually rigid&mdash;how|ever, we mu&s;t blame Lucinda for mentioning <HI>five brats</HI> at a birth, in her &s;ong to the old maid, it is not within the pale of delicacy; when Woodcock gives a &s;pecimen of his &s;inging, I wi&s;h &s;o gro&s;s a depredation had not been committed upon Damon and Phillida; be&s;ides, tho' &s;ung by a humouri&s;t, I don't think it very &s;uitable to his daughter's pre|&s;ence, what follows after the old man's departure between the lovers means very little, except to men|tion that his ob&s;tinacy is a circum&s;tance much in

<P>Ro&s;etta's &s;oliloquy, examining into the &s;tate of her heart, is pretty enough; the en&s;uing &s;cene be|tween her and Young Meadows, al&s;o has a &s;hare of &s;pirited natural plea&s;antry; that reciprocal pride which agitates the lovers, and throws them into fret|ful altercation, is ju&s;tly conceived, and by no means ill-expre&s;&s;ed; nor does the &s;pirit evaporate by being drawn out too far; the ju&s;tice's appearance falls in well, and occa&s;ions them to huddle up a kind of re|conciliation.</P>

<P>In the &s;cene between Hodge and Madge we find more brutality breaking out from the clown, than humour from either of them; however, his &s;ong is not without merit; Ro&s;etta's intervention creates a kind of bu&s;tle tolerably agreeable, and throws Hodge into a whim&s;ical dilemma; the reflections and &s;ong of Ro&s;etta upon his behaviour to Margery are ex|tremely pretty, exhibiting indi&s;putable truth, and &s;ome u&s;eful hints to the fair &s;ex; her compa&s;&s;ion for the deluded girl &s;peaks &s;en&s;ibility and goodne&s;s of heart&mdash;Madge's &s;udden de&s;ign of trying London

to repair her misfortunes, is not at all unna|tural though it &s;eems &s;trangely abrupt.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation between Lucinda and Ro&s;etta furni&s;hes information, that a plan is laid for the former to elope with Eu&s;tace.&mdash;Hawthorn, though the occa&s;ion of his entrance appears dubitable, is judiciou&s;ly introduced, as what he &s;ays not only rai&s;es an agreeable curio&s;ity in the young ladies, but the audience al&s;o; &s;ome &s;en&s;ible remarks up|on marriage, and the qualifications of a hu&s;band, en&s;ue, which concludes the &s;econd act with a ve|ry plea&s;ing and &s;pirited trio, &s;upported adequately by the &s;everal characters.</P>
<P>Sir William Meadows, a hearty, plain old gentleman, begins the third act with Hawthorn, their &s;cene means nothing more than to throw &s;ome glimmering of light on the plot; indeed the &s;ong with which it concludes has con&s;iderable merit, per|haps the mo&s;t, for &s;olid &s;en&s;e and natural expre&s;&s;ion, of any in the whole piece; Ro&s;etta's change of dre&s;s &s;eems to have no meaning except to plea&s;e the vanity of external appearance, &s;o incident to mo&s;t ladies on, and indeed off the &s;tage; her confe&s;&s;ion of love for young Meadows, even in his &s;ervile capa|city, is ingenuous; and her pride, objecting to rank only, &s;hows commendable &s;pirit, by Hodge we find that Lucinda's &s;cheme of elopement is di&s;covered by her aunt, Mrs. Deborah, this gives an agree|able turn of &s;ympathetic concern in Ro&s;etta, who generou&s;ly feels for a friend, though her own con|cerns are in &s;o pro&s;perous a line of direction.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="179">The old maid's haughty rigid treatment of her niece is very characteri&s;tic, and the di&s;play of her own hou&s;ewifely di&s;po&s;ition truly humourous; her reflections upon the ill effects of reading are the na|tural produce of a narrow mind, uncultivated by education, yet vain of its defective powers; Lucinda at la&s;t &s;ets her aunt at defiance, but upon what prin|ciple, or what the thought is &s;he hints at, we know not.</P>
<P>Hodge's &s;oliloquy means very little unle&s;s to ac|quaint us with his hopes of Ro&s;etta's favour, which, from the great change in her appearance, and her behaviour to him ju&s;t before, we think he has little right to expect; the &s;ong is a very &s;trange in&s;ignifi|cant jumble of ru&s;tic licentiou&s;ne&s;s, containing &s;ome truth, little &s;en&s;e and le&s;s humour.</P>
<P>Young Meadows, with as unmeaning a change of dre&s;s as Ro&s;etta's now appears, and expre&s;&s;es un|ea&s;ine&s;s &s;uitable to an anxious lover at his mi&s;tre&s;s's delay; the &s;imile in his &s;ong, which likens beauty en&s;hrining merit to a curious ca&s;ket containing gems, de&s;erves rather a better epithet than pretty, but the ver&s;ification is not &s;o ea&s;y as it might have been; the lover's &s;urprize at &s;eeing his father in&s;tead of the lady is a well conceived circum&s;tance, and what follows does much credit to his hone&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted feelings; Sir William's a&s;&s;umed di&s;plea&s;ure works up the conver&s;ation plea&s;ingly, and Hawthorn is a good medium to keep up the de&s;ign of coming at young Meadows's real inclinations.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="180">Ro&s;etta is introduced at a happy point of time, and the di&s;covery that the young people's inclina|tions, and their parents intentions exactly coincide, is very well unfolded: in the mid&s;t of her own hap|pine&s;s remembering Lucinda's perplexed &s;ituation, and intere&s;ting her friends for that young lady, throws fre&s;h light on Ro&s;etta's character, and re|commends her to an increa&s;e of favour.&mdash;Haw|thorn's re&s;olution, expre&s;&s;ed in his &s;ong, of not giving up his rural enjoyments for the bu&s;tle, &s;moke and noi&s;e of London, is the ju&s;t effu&s;ion of a di&s;|engaged mind tolerably expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene, though &s;hort, contains con&s;ider|able humour; the oddity of Woodcock and his &s;i&s;ter is extremely well pre&s;erved, and well play'd upon by the lovers; the dialogue runs judiciou&s;ly into a pit-pat &s;train, and introduces the cata&s;trophe plea&s;antly. Sir William's character of Eu&s;tace ju&s;ti|fies his claim to Lucinda, and making the ju&s;tice's ob&s;tinate contempt of Mrs. Deborah's under&s;tand|ing a motive for agreeing to his daughter's marriage, clo&s;es the piece as an audience would wi&s;h, without any forced incident.</P>
<P>The unities of time and place are well enough ob&s;erved in this piece; the plot is regularly carried on, and though it is rather too &s;imple can|not be objected to as unintere&s;ting or tedious; the &s;cenes are ranged in an agreeable &s;tate of connec|tion, without &s;uperfluity or &s;cantine&s;s; the dia|logue has ea&s;e and &s;ome gleams of &s;pirit, but not a &s;park of wit; the &s;ongs in general exhibit the
<PB N="167" REF="181">
mo&s;t trite, hackneyed &s;entiments, in aukward ver&s;ification, with &s;everal &s;lips of grammar, and not a &s;hadow of genius; as to the e&s;&s;ence of dra|matic merit, a moral, there is no trace of it to be di&s;covered&mdash;the young ones very romantically run away from their parents, and for &s;uch a notable breach of filial duty they have their wi&s;hes fulfilled; Lucinda does all &s;he can towards an elopement, and gets her lover too; though there are no very pernicious inferences ari&s;ing from the&s;e incidents, yet they recommend indi&s;cretion, and are void of any u&s;eful tendency; and brings them at be&s;t under the in&s;ipid denomination of merely inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to characters, the ju&s;tice is a well drawn, opinionated, ignorant, po&s;itive old cox|comb, mo&s;tly in the wrong without any ill mean|ing, and when in the right, void of &s;en&s;ible in|tention; Sir William Meadows a pliant, good humoured baronet, in whom &s;ome peculiarity is attempted, without the lea&s;t degree of &s;ucce&s;s, un|le&s;s a mo&s;t palling repetition of
<Q REND="inline">"let me never do an ill turn,"</Q>
lays any claim to merit.&mdash;Young Mea|dows is a mere loving milk&s;op, with nothing but di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s to mark him, and yet Eu&s;tace is much more a cypher; Hodge is a clown mo|derately well depicted; Ro&s;etta and Lucinda, two young ladies of independent principles, who think they have an exclu&s;ive right to plea&s;e them&s;elves, without the lea&s;t appeal to parental juri&s;diction, and Mrs. Deborah a formal antiquated virgin, vain of judgment which &s;he has not, and mali|ciou&s;ly

fond of preventing that happine&s;s in others &s;he never has enjoyed her&s;elf, and de&s;pairs of ever ta&s;ting.</P>
<P>The part of Woodcock was doubtle&s;s de&s;ign|ed for Mr. SHUTER, and I pre&s;ume it will be admitted that no author ever judged an actor's capability better; there is a &s;trong peculiarity of humour mo&s;t happily hit off in performance; the character owes its commanding influence much more to features happily laughable, and expre&s;&s;ion truly comic, than the writer's genius; and without exaggeration it may be &s;aid that Mr. SHUTER, in this whim&s;ical ju&s;tice, mu&s;t have force enough to dilate even the rigid mu&s;cles of methodi&s;m; if it was po&s;&s;ible to tran&s;plant a groaning congregation from Moorfields, or Tottenham-court, into Covent Garden, even while their ears tingled with a fire and brim&s;tone harangue, they mu&s;t unbend their gloomy brows, and &s;milingly obey the irre&s;i&s;table force of matchle&s;s humour.</P>
<P>Young Meadows has very little acting merit, therefore is well adapted to that faintne&s;s of ex|pre&s;&s;ion &s;o di&s;coverable in Mr. MATTOCKS, who neverthele&s;s &s;upports the &s;ongs, and even &s;peaks better than Mr. DUBELLAMY, a gentleman we never wi&s;h to hear <HI>&s;peak</HI> in public, both in ju&s;tice to him&s;elf and to the audience: Mr. DODD of Drury Lane did this part much better than either of the performers above mentioned;&mdash;there is an agreeable manner and a &s;en&s;ible vivacity about him, that the others are entire &s;trangers to.</P>

<P>That inoffen&s;ive per&s;onage, Eu&s;tace, finds very tolerable accommodation with Mr. DYER; and it is no &s;mall degree of merit to pre&s;erve &s;uch an un|&s;ea&s;oned character from the charge of in&s;ipidity.

&s;uitor to Juliet, con&s;equently their brief interview offers nothing worth a particular remark.</P>
<P>Mercutio, that peculiar offspring of &s;pirited ima|gination, even at his entrance &s;trikes out the path of whim; Romeo's entrance, and the que&s;tions occa|&s;ioned by it, &s;how much natural ea&s;e; the breaks in that &s;peech where he a&s;ks about the fray, and men|tions his love, are ma&s;terly; but we apprehend his coming to the &s;ubject, thus at once, is no way con|&s;i&s;tent with that impenetrable &s;ecrecy charged again&s;t him in a former &s;cene; indeed, concealing it from his father is not &s;urprizing, but after avoiding Benvolio, when &s;ingle, to communicate the point immedi|ately before another per&s;on, and &s;uch an humouri&s;t too, (from whom he can expect little but ridicule) rather o'er&s;teps, as we &s;uppo&s;e, the bounds of na|tural propriety.</P>
<P>A touch of &s;uper&s;titious weakne&s;s we find thrown into Romeo's character, in the mention of a dream; but as it introduces &s;o beautiful a de&s;cription of the queen of dreams, her equipage and various influence upon various characters, we mu&s;t rather be plea&s;ed than offended: tran&s;cribing Mercutio's whole &s;peech would infringe too much on our re&s;olution of very limited quotation, and yet we &s;carce know how to decline it;&mdash;examining the proportions, how|ever, is not di&s;pen&s;ible, for though we may admire general beauty, it would be wrong to pa&s;s unnoticed what appear to us particular lap&s;es.</P>

<P>Taking Romeo to Capulet's ball, by way of di|verting his imagination, and that proving the means to enflame his pa&s;&s;ions, are well de&s;igned incidents towards opening and carrying on the plot.</P>
<P>Lady Capulet and Nur&s;e appear next; however great a favourite the loquacious old dame may be with the majority of an audience, critici&s;m and ta&s;te unite in the wi&s;h that no &s;uch per&s;onage had appear|ed&mdash;indelicacy is very natural to nur&s;es, but why the reformer of this play &s;hould have retained &s;wear|ing by her maidenhead we cannot think&mdash;Juliet's introduction has a degree of plea&s;ing &s;implicity in it, and we apprehend a very agreeable u&s;eful &s;cene might have been &s;truck out between the mother and daughter, on the &s;ubject of marriage, far preferable to Mrs. Nur&s;e's trifling rhap&s;ody of circum&s;tantial nothingne&s;s; which, though extremely natural, means nothing but to rai&s;e &s;ome laughs, which we deem highly di&s;graceful to the nature, bent and dignity of tragic compo&s;itions; be&s;ides, the old lady's hint of Juliet's falling backwards, is only fit for the ears of a parcel of go&s;&s;ips who have wi&s;hed decency good night and locked the door upon her.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="190">Gregory's familiar, low comedy me&s;&s;age which concludes the &s;cene, is totally incon&s;i&s;tent with com|mon Engli&s;h decorum, much more the pride and di&s;tance of Italian quality; Nur&s;e, from her &s;tation, may claim &s;ome liberty, but &s;uch headlong behavi|our from other &s;ervants is very cen&s;urable.</P>
<P>Capulet, in welcoming the gue&s;ts to his ma&s;que|rade, &s;peaks to the ladies of their corns in a manner which may be jocular, yet it is not polite; but I &s;up|po&s;e having their faces covered is his apology; the little di&s;pute about time between the old fellows is well &s;ugge&s;ted; Tibalt's fiery temper &s;hews it&s;elf properly upon di&s;tingui&s;hing Romeo's voice, and he is re&s;trained from violence upon very ho&s;pitable and ju&s;t principles by Capulet, who manife&s;ts com|mendable &s;pirit&mdash;Romeo's addre&s;s to Juliet is mode&s;tly affectionate, and her replies cordially deli|cate; however, with re&s;pect to the liking &s;he takes, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e love flies with lightning's &s;wifte&s;t wings into her brea&s;t; it rather indicates feelings of forward &s;u&s;ceptibility&mdash;it is judicious to &s;eparate the lovers after a &s;hort interchange of words, and Juliet's method of finding out who was her new favourite very proper.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, Romeo pre|&s;ents him&s;elf in a &s;tate of amorous pen&s;ivene&s;s, view|ing the man&s;ion of his mi&s;tre&s;s; and upon going off is &s;ought for by his two friends, one of whom, Mer|cutio, in the flow of raillery, throws out &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions highly exceptionable; we heartily wi&s;h he had conjured no further than the lady's foot and
<PB N="177" REF="191">
leg; and that he had mentioned &s;ome other place for rai&s;ing a &s;pirit, than what he points at in the next &s;peech&mdash;two pa&s;&s;ages more unpardonably gro&s;s than tho&s;e hinted are &s;carce to be met; they call loudly for obliteration; it is not what &s;uch a man as Mercutio might probably &s;peak we are to con|&s;ider, but what is fit for readers to peru&s;e, or &s;pec|tators to hear.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene Romeo, who has romantically leaped the garden wall of a known foe, without any leave or a&s;&s;ignation from the lady, is by the poet's unlimited power brought to a &s;ight of Juliet; who, by a happy effort of imagination, is made to re|veal her love for Romeo, not &s;u&s;pecting his pre|&s;ence; her ju&s;tification of him from the quarrel of their families is &s;en&s;ible and fanciful; nor do we know any thing better conceived than his &s;udden reply upon mentioning that his name is the only im|pediment to her wi&s;hes and his own.</P>
<P>The diffident turn of expre&s;&s;ion he u&s;es on being charged with an abrupt approach is extremely beautiful, and Juliet's apprehen&s;ion for his coming into &s;o hazardous a place very natural; indeed the whole &s;cene is &s;o intere&s;tingly tender&mdash;that we think even a de&s;pairing old maid could not &s;ee it without &s;ome &s;ympathy: to trace all its beauties would force us into a tedious repetition of multiplied eulogiums and leave us little to &s;ay on the following parts of the piece; therefore let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve that the lovers expre&s;s mutual affection, and exchange their vows in a mo&s;t becoming manner; the interruption
<PB N="178" REF="192">
by nur&s;e cau&s;es a fine agitation of &s;pirits, and di&s;|jointed eagerne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; if in &s;uch a glare of beauties, there be one more &s;triking than another, it is that of Juliet's forgetting, or pretending to forget why &s;he called Romeo back.</P>
<P>Fryar Lawrence is introduced with a ju&s;t degree of benign, moral dignity; and his &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation on the contra&s;te qualities of particular herbs, which he aptly compares to tho&s;e &s;eeds of virtue and vice, which inhabit the human brea&s;t, is not only beautiful, but pregnant with much &s;olid &s;en&s;e and edifying truth; in nothing is providence more de|lightfully manife&s;ted than in the vegetable world; nor can any &s;ubject lead &s;peculation into a more captivating maze; the a&s;&s;imilation of grace and rude will, to poi&s;on and medicine is nervou&s;ly philo&s;ophi|cal, luxuriantly in&s;tructive; having &s;aid thus much in favour of the Fryar's &s;ololoquy, we mu&s;t la|ment, as ab&s;olute foes to dramatic rhimes, the mode of ver&s;ification adopted, indeed the mea&s;ure is not &s;o monotonous for a &s;peaker, as jingle in general is, yet we apprehend blank ver&s;e would &s;uit nature, the author's &s;entiments, and the performer's utterance much better, by way of encouraging &s;ome abler pen to undertake &s;o de&s;irable an alter|ation we diffidently &s;ubmit what follows to can|did ta&s;te.</P>

<P>What pa&s;&s;es between the Fryar and Romeo is &s;uitable and plea&s;ing; we mu&s;t be of opinion that the change of affection from Ro&s;aline to Juliet is judiciou&s;ly omitted, as it certainly &s;erved no pur|po&s;e but throwing an imputation upon Romeo's con&s;tancy, which tainted, mu&s;t make him le&s;s the object of approbation and pity; there is a mo&s;t com|mendable prudent paternal tenderne&s;s in the expre&s;|&s;ions of Lawrence.</P>
<P>Benvolio and Mercutio appear, &s;till upon the hunt for Romeo, when the latter indulges his odd hu|mours in as odd expre&s;&s;ions; his picture of Tibalt, who appears a man of mere fire and quarrel, &s;eems
<PB N="180" REF="194">
not to bear a ju&s;t re&s;emblance; bullies are for the mo&s;t part cowards, but very &s;eldom coxcombs; com|paring Romeo to a dried herring wanting its roe is a very low pun, and mo&s;t pitiful quibbling conceit; the &s;cene with nur&s;e and her &s;impleton attendant, is an extraordinary jumble of matter contemptibly ludicrous; her me&s;&s;age concerning Juliet has relation to the plot, but we wi&s;h it had been delivered in a more &s;uitable manner, than by this comic amba&s;&s;a|dre&s;s.</P>
<P>As if what we complain of was not more than &s;ufficiently farcical, &s;tage policy, to plea&s;e the up|per regions, generally pre&s;ents Peter as bearing an enormous fan before his mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;kipping al&s;o and grinning like a baboon; the beating which he gets for not re&s;enting Mercutio's raillery, is a very mean, pantomimical, yet &s;ure motive of laughter.</P>
<P>The impatience expre&s;&s;ed by Juliet to hear the con&s;equence of her me&s;&s;age is expre&s;&s;ed in lines charmingly poetical, without any violence to nature or &s;train of imagination; and the nur&s;e's behaviour in what follows natural but we wi&s;h &s;he had not mentioned Romeo's <HI>climbing</HI> a <HI>bird's ne&s;t</HI> &s;oon, nor that Juliet mu&s;t, <HI>bear the burden &s;oon at night.</HI></P>
<P>In the next &s;cene, where Juliet &s;hould have been allowed more time to appear, we find Fryar Law|rence has agreed to marry the young couple, and &s;eems tenderly intere&s;ted, but drops a very ungener|ous in&s;inuation when he concludes the act thus
<Q><L>&mdash; by your leaves you &s;hall not &s;tay alone,</L>

<P>Which conveys an idea of &s;u&s;picion without any

cau&s;e, for the lovers don't hint at retirement, but &s;eem impatient for his benediction.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act we meet Mer|cutio again fraught with quaintne&s;s and quibble; his quarrel with Tibalt is &s;uch as might be expected from &s;uch blades, and taking Romeo's quarrel upon him&s;elf &s;hews &s;omething of genero&s;ity; after receiv|ing his death wound he utters a &s;trange incoherent rhap&s;ody, and &s;o much pre&s;erves uniformity that his death commonly proves a very laughable inci|dent: it is reported as an expre&s;&s;ion of Shake&s;peare's that he was obliged to kill Mercutio in the third act, to &s;ave him&s;elf; whatever he may have thought of the character or whatever has been thought &s;ince, if he never had been brought to light in this play, though a fine effort of genius would have been waved, pro|priety mu&s;t have been much better pre&s;erved; it may be &s;aid le&s;s &s;pirit would have been the con&s;e|quence, we can't grant this, but Shake&s;peare's mu&s;e on &s;uch a &s;ubject could never have wanted more in|tere&s;ting matter.</P>
<P>Romeo's engagement with Tibalt &s;hews great &s;en|&s;ibility of friend&s;hip; we have heard him bear reflec|tions, and of a &s;evere nature vented again&s;t him&s;elf with philo&s;ophic re&s;olution, but, rou&s;ed by Mercutio's death, he takes revenge which occa&s;ions con&s;equences of a very &s;erious nature, whence the plot takes an important turn.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard an anecdote relative to the part of Tibalt, which, though trifling, I cannot omit; an itinerant barn-&s;pouting hero, who had &s;hip|ped too much beer aboard, performing it, forgot that he was to be killed; and thereupon fought
<PB N="182" REF="196">
Romeo furiou&s;ly for near ten minutes, nor would give up the conte&s;t till his lady cried out with tre|mendous voice from behind&mdash;Dennis, Dennis,&mdash; cur&s;e the fellow why don't you die,&mdash;her tongue, to him the emblem of thunder laid him flat immediate|ly; on coming off he was &s;aluted with many re|proaches for having forgot him&s;elf; forgot my&s;elf, no &s;ays he, I knew what I was about, and con&s;idered that Tibalt was a &s;tout young fellow who would take a great deal of killing. To &s;ay truth the remark was not ami&s;s; for we may &s;uppo&s;e, as he is drawn, Tibalt him&s;elf &s;eems to think &s;o.</P>
<P>After a &s;eries of &s;cuffling the prince pre&s;ents him|&s;elf&mdash;indeed &s;uch a prince was never &s;een; a ju&s;tice of peace or a high con&s;table to interfere where riots happen in the &s;treet is well enough, but for a &s;ov|reign, however petty, to appear &s;o often upon &s;uch occa&s;ions is a &s;trange pro&s;titution of dignity&mdash;be|&s;ides in the fir&s;t &s;cene, where no mi&s;chief is done, he threatens their lives upon any future breach of the peace; yet in this, where two have lo&s;t their lives one of them his own kin&s;man, he good natured|ly talks of fines for puni&s;hment&mdash;we apprehend &s;o much tilting and the purport of this &s;cene would have been much better in relation than action, Benvolio's account, though fine at pre&s;ent, would have had more merit if otherwi&s;e introduced&mdash;and the play would have been freed from a mon&s;trous incumbrance of multiplied battles.</P>
<P>Juliet's &s;oliloquy beginning <Q REND="inline">"gallop apace"</Q> is a little in the extravagant &s;tyle, but her &s;ituation and violent affection &s;omewhat apologize for her flights; nur&s;e's entrance gives an alarming turn of pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="183" REF="197">
and pity puts on her plaintive countenance for the young lady's painful &s;ituation; this &s;cene is wrought up with mo&s;t ma&s;terly judgment&mdash;Juliet's &s;uppo&s;i|tion that Romeo's dead, is fine, then hearing that a kin&s;man is killed by her hu&s;band, and that in con&s;equence he is bani&s;hed&mdash;her charging Romeo with a &s;avage &s;pirit, and curbing nur&s;e for ca&s;ting reproach on him, though &s;he her&s;elf has done it, are circum|&s;tances happily imagined; and nothing can exceed the climax of impa&s;&s;ioned expre&s;&s;ion in which Juliet de&s;cants upon her misfortune; the gleam of comfort given in expectation of &s;eeing her hu&s;band, concludes the &s;cene well, and unbends the &s;ympathetic feelings good acting mo&s;t unavoidably rai&s;e in an audience.</P>
<P>Romeo's &s;cene with his gho&s;tly father is an effort of genius equal to any degree of prai&s;e, and affords powerful expre&s;&s;ion a very copious opportunity of di&s;playing it&s;elf, &s;o as to work irre&s;i&s;tably on the human heart; the Fryar's prudent advice is well contra&s;ted to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lover's frantic ravings; and his whole behaviour &s;hows active, cordial good|ne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>The garden &s;cene, for that between Capulet and Paris contains nothing but appointment of Juliet's marriage-day with the latter, is poetical and pret|ty, but as we apprehend, cut rather too &s;hort in repre&s;entation; on account perhaps of relieving the performers; which is a point &s;hould always be con&s;ulted yet not &s;o far as to omit any beau|ties that may plea&s;e and ornament; the alternate de&s;ires and fears of Romeo's &s;taying are natural effects of wi&s;hing, and intimidated affection.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="198">The following interview between Juliet and her parents places her in a very compa&s;&s;ionable &s;itua|tion; while Capulet exerts a degree of parental au|thority, too common we fear, which reflects no great credit upon his head or heart&mdash;Juliet's appeal to nur&s;e as her &s;ole remaining friend is pathetically pret|ty, but the unfeeling wretch's reply dete&s;table.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;es between Juliet and the Fryar at the beginning of the fourth act is expre&s;&s;ive of affecting &s;olemnity; a cri&s;is of the utmo&s;t importance is ar|rived; grief a&s;&s;ails her on one &s;ide and apprehen&s;ion on the other, while weeping love ca&s;ts tear-filled eyes alternately on both; in this perplexity her ap|plication to the Fryar is very natural, nor can we blame, in her circum&s;tances, tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of de&s;pair &s;he lets fall; however we think &s;ome argu|ments again&s;t the very idea of &s;uicide would have fallen &s;uitably and with force from her holy, tender hearted confe&s;&s;or; what he propo&s;es of having her buried alive, to e&s;cape Paris is as wild and romantic a device as ever entered into any drama, it might do in a novel, but in a repre&s;entation of nature, is no way ju&s;tifiable; however we are apt to forgive even ab&s;urdity, when it contributes to &s;uch an affecting cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>We cannot help thinking that all through this act Juliet's entrances and exits are crouded upon one another too much; there are but three lines &s;poken between her leaving the Fryar's cell and appearing in her father's hou&s;e; the &s;oliloquy &s;he &s;peaks pre|vious to drinking the contents of her phial, is beau|tiful
<PB N="185" REF="199">
beyond de&s;cription; terror and pity are alter|nately called upon in a mo&s;t forceable manner.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene Capulet not only appears a mere old wife, but al&s;o blunders &s;trangely; the cur|few-bell is an Engli&s;h in&s;titution by William the con|queror; therefore improper for an Italian to mention; be&s;ides that bell rings at eight in the evening, yet he &s;peaks of three o'clock in the morning, and the &s;e|cond cock; this might be ea&s;ily rectified by &s;aying the <HI>matin</HI> bell: Nur&s;e's remarks before &s;he attempts to wake Juliet are contemptible, at &s;uch a cri&s;is; and commonly make an audience laugh when they &s;hould cry&mdash;what the parents and the Friar &s;ay, after the &s;uppo&s;ed death is di&s;covered, may pa&s;s without the cen&s;ure of flatne&s;s, but merits no degree of prai&s;e; it de&s;erves note, that from what Capulet here &s;ays, great preparations have been made for the wed|ding; though in the third act he declared it &s;hould be private, on account of his kin&s;man Tibalt's recent death.</P>
<P>Though not ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential, nothing could be better devi&s;ed than a funeral proce&s;&s;ion, to render this play thoroughly popular; as it is certain that three-fourths of every audience are more capable of enjoying &s;ound and &s;hew, than &s;olid &s;en&s;e and poetical imagination; &s;tage-pageantry cannot be very plea&s;|ing at any time to judicious ta&s;te, but, if at all commendable, it is upon this occa&s;ion.&mdash;The dirge as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent we diffidently conceive liable to &s;ome objections.&mdash;In the fir&s;t chorus,
<Q REND="inline">"di&s;mal moan,"</Q>
favours much of the ballad &s;tile; in the &s;ucceeding air, comparing Juliet's eyes to
<PB N="186" REF="200">
<HI>breaking</HI> day, is but paying an awkward compli|ment of brightne&s;s, and makes her, like the morn, grey-eyed. In the third air, <Q REND="inline">"look down below"</Q> is a tautologous mode of expre&s;&s;ion, though &s;ome|what countenanced by cu&s;tom; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to look down, without looking below; or to look up without looking above.</P>
<P>Romeo plea&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;atisfactory dreams is very natural, and a good preparation for that material change of feeling, which Balthazar's heart-rending intelligence occa&s;ions.&mdash;The tran&s;ition to a&s;toni&s;hment of grief is amazingly fine; and his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the melancholly me&s;&s;enger by broken &s;entences, very natural.&mdash;Nothing was ever depict|ed better in the whole &s;cope of poetical painting, than the apothecary and his &s;hop; yet we mu&s;t think Romeo's recollection too coolly minute for a per&s;on in his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind; what pa&s;&s;es between him and the apothecary contains &s;ome u&s;e|ful, pathetic reflections.&mdash;What occurs between the friars John and Lawrence, is merely to acquaint the audience that a letter to Romeo of Juliet's &s;ituation has mi&s;carried.&mdash;We do not perceive any particular material u&s;e in bringing Paris to the monument, un|le&s;s to &s;acrifice him in view of the audience, without having committed any crime to merit death; con|&s;idered as a rival, he is &s;o unknown to him&s;elf, and &s;eems to have been &s;incere in his regard by vi&s;iting the grave of his intended bride.</P>
<P>Romeo's &s;peech upon approaching the monu|ment, has much tenderne&s;s, a&s;&s;umed policy, and real fire; the brief, yet cordial farewel he takes of

a faithful dome&s;tic, we have always con&s;idered as truly affecting.</P>
<P>Though Paris's appearance gives room for &s;ome good acting, we apprehend the &s;cene would have been more uniformly &s;olemn without him; di&s;co|vering Juliet in her inanimate &s;tate, by breaking open the tomb, catches the eyes, and Romeo's re|flections previous to drinking the poi&s;on, arre&s;ts the hearts of &s;pectators; nature is brought to her mo&s;t critical feelings at the moment Juliet awakes, and her hu&s;band's affectionate tran&s;ports, forgetting what he has done, fills the audience with a mo&s;t cordial &s;ympathy of &s;atisfaction, which is &s;oon da&s;hed in both by the poi&s;on's operating.&mdash;Romeo's di&s;traction and her tenderne&s;s are &s;o excellently wrought up, that we cannot &s;uppo&s;e any heart &s;o obdurate as not to be penetrated.&mdash;Her behaviour after his death, catching as it were his frenzy, and pa&s;&s;ing from grief to di&s;traction, is a ma&s;terly va|riation in Juliet; what follows her paying the debt of nature, is judiciou&s;ly contracted into a narrow compa&s;s; indeed we will venture to affirm, that no play ever received greater advantage from alteration than this tragedy, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t act; bring|ing Juliet to life before Romeo dies is undoubtedly a change of infinite merit.</P>
<P>The whole dying &s;cene does Mr. Garrick great credit, as being worthy the matchle&s;s author he has furni&s;hed it to, and we mu&s;t venture to affirm, that his prejudice in favour, even of Shake&s;peare's faults, was the only rea&s;on why he did not retrench
<PB N="188" REF="202">
and add more, which in particular places he ought certainly to have done.</P>
<P>The plot of Romeo and Juliet is romantic and irregular; the characters oddly conceived and &s;trangely jumbled; the &s;cenes very unequal in mat|ter&mdash;&s;ome extremely in&s;ignificant, others enchant|ingly beautiful; the unities are violently, yet not offen&s;ively broken, and the cata&s;trophe, which hangs in the balance of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, as long as it &s;hould remain doubtful, is equal, if not &s;uperior, to any in the Engli&s;h drama, as it now &s;tands; in re&s;pect of moral, &s;ome very in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons may be drawn from this piece, fir&s;t from the lovers, that di&s;obedience in children, or doing what they know is totally again&s;t parental inclinations brings a train of perplexities, and produces the mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences.&mdash;Parents may learn that family quarrels are not only un&s;ocially ab&s;urd, but pregnant with mi&s;ery to them and their offspring; they may al&s;o perceive, that compelling youth in the article of marriage is an unnatural, dangerous exertion of authority; and duelli&s;ts may infer from Tibalt's fall, that the &s;word of fate hangs &s;u&s;pended by a cobweb-thread over a turbulent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The hero of this piece is ve&s;ted with very warm pa&s;&s;ions, with much love, and what in that ca&s;e may well be expected, little prudence; he fixes his affections upon a particular object, and determines to have her at any rate: the two valuable qualifica|tions of courage and friend&s;hip he &s;eems happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, but, upon the whole, &s;hews rather an amiable than a great mind; ardent in affection,
<PB N="189" REF="203">
vehement in rage, poignant in grief; thus equip|ped, and &s;o circum&s;tanced as he is, no wonder he affords capital talents a fine opportunity of di&s;play|ing them&s;elves; and a character upon the &s;tage was never &s;upported with more luxuriant merit than this by Me&s;&s;. GARRICK and BARRY, or BARRY and GARRICK; for when tho&s;e inimitable performers conte&s;ted it &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years &s;ince, it was extremely difficult to &s;ay who &s;hould &s;tand fir&s;t; we &s;hall offer a compari&s;on upon &s;trict impartiality, and leave deci&s;ion to the unprejudiced reader.</P>
<P>As to figure, though there is no nece&s;&s;ity for a lover being tall, yet we apprehend Mr. BARRY had a pecu|liar advantage in this point; his amorous harmony of features, melting eyes, and unequalled plaintivene&s;s of voice, &s;eemed to promi&s;e every thing we could wi&s;h, and yet the &s;uperior grace of Mr. Garrick's at|titudes, the vivacity of his countenance, and the fire of his expre&s;&s;ion, &s;hewed there were many e&s;&s;ential beauties in which his great competitor might be ex|celled: tho&s;e &s;cenes in which they mo&s;t evidently ro&s;e above each other, are as follow &mdash;Mr. BARRY the Garden &s;cene of the &s;econd act&mdash;Mr. GARRICK the friar &s;cene in the third&mdash;Mr. BARRY the garden &s;cene in the fourth&mdash;Mr. GARRICK in the fir&s;t &s;cene, de&s;cription of the Apothecary, &amp;c. fifth act&mdash;Mr. BARRY fir&s;t part of the tomb &s;cene, and Mr. GAR|RICK from where the poi&s;on operates to the end.</P>
<P>Having &s;een this play three times at each hou&s;e, during the contention, and having held the critical &s;cale in as ju&s;t an equilibrium as po&s;&s;ible, by not only
<PB N="190" REF="204">
my own feelings but tho&s;e of the audience in gene|ral, I perceived that Mr. GARRICK commanded mo&s;t applau&s;e&mdash;Mr. BARRY mo&s;t tears: de&s;irous of tracing this difference to its &s;ource; I found that as dry &s;orrow drinks our blood, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hment checks our tears; that by a kind of electrical merit Mr. GARRICK &s;truck all hearts with a degree of in|expre&s;&s;ible feeling, and bore conception &s;o far beyond her u&s;ual &s;phere that &s;ofter &s;en&s;ations lay hid in wonder.</P>
<P>After two &s;uch truly capital performers we can &s;carce mention any other adventurer with patience; however, to &s;pectators who never had &s;een them, Me&s;&s;rs. POWELL and ROSS might have given con&s;iderable &s;atisfacttion; their figures and voices &s;uited well, but powers, countenances, and judg|ment to execute the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes, were greatly wanting; Mr. SMITH, at pre&s;ent, bu&s;tles through the part with mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ive monotony at Covent-garden, and Mr. CAUTHERLY, without one requi&s;ite whatever of a principal performer, hobbles through it at Drury-lane; &s;uch an attempt is hardly to be conceived under the di&s;advantage of awkward deportment, limbs void of &s;ymmetry, action without meaning, voice without power, and features of mo&s;t defective expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mercutio never was nor never will be in better hands than Mr. WOODWARD's: Grimace and at|titude, which &s;o often dimini&s;h that gentleman's merit in other characters, are here of &s;ingular ad|vantage, and the peculiarity of &s;tile is admirably &s;et forth by his peculiarity of expre&s;&s;ion; e&s;pecially in
<PB N="191" REF="205">
the capital &s;peech relative to Queen Mab&mdash;notwith|&s;tanding Mr. MACKLIN was extremely well received, yet we cannot apprehend him in any &s;hape qualified for the part; a &s;aturnine ca&s;t of countenance, &s;ententi|ous utterance, hollow toned voice, and heavine&s;s of de|portment, ill &s;uited the whim&s;ical Mercutio; they might have done for what Otway has &s;trangely met|amorpho&s;ed him to, a mere cynic; but tended to mar Shake&s;peare's intention; however the author's &s;en&s;e was critically pre&s;erved in this, as well as all other characters by the theatrical ne&s;tor; Mr. OBRIEN undoubtedly &s;tood &s;econd, and the late Mr. PAL|MER was not without con&s;iderable merit: as to Mr. DODD we conceive him totally inadequate.</P>
<P>Mr. HAVARD rendered the friar extremely re|&s;pectable, nor was Mr. RIDOUT far behind; the former had more of characteri&s;tic placidity, the lat|ter &s;hewed more nece&s;&s;ary weight of expre&s;&s;ion, Mr. HULL, who&s;e propriety of &s;peaking is at all times unque&s;tionable, wants &s;omething of &s;olemnity, not through defect of judgment or knowledge of nature, but a limitation of powers, which often check, in that gentleman, very eminent degrees of capital me|rit&mdash;Mr. LOVE&mdash;why have I occa&s;ion to mention &s;uch a murderer of blank ver&s;e, &s;uch a co&s;&s;ac of tragedy&mdash; who bolts from a &s;onorous, rumbling, untuneable throat, the &s;mooth, philo&s;ophic, generous &s;entiments of the friar in a mode exactly re&s;embling the harmo|nious notes of a Newgate turnkey brow-beating un|happy pri&s;oners; we mu&s;t however allow him the me|rit of a figure and countenance very well adapted&mdash;Mr.

BANNISTER would do the play credit in this part; indeed too much as it is now patched together.</P>
<P>Capulet had great ju&s;tice done him by Me&s;&s;rs. SPARKS and BERRY, but is at pre&s;ent wretchedly off, whether we view him in that mo&s;t tragical of all tragedians Mr. GIBSON, or the le&s;s offen&s;ive though water-gruel, Mr. BURTON&mdash;Benvolio &s;uffered no damage from Mr. MOZEEN, though a very poor creature, but makes a better figure repre&s;ented by Mr. PACKER; as to that &s;mirking &s;elf-impor|tant figure of an actor, Mr. DAVIS, who &s;peaks as he walks, by a kind of in&s;tinct, and whom to mention is a wa&s;te of words, we wonder how even con&s;ummate ignorance with its con&s;tant companion could make him think of the &s;tage; or how any manager could ever u&s;e him in any other light than as a dumb eunuch in &s;ome of the Turki&s;h plays&mdash;the other male characters in this piece we pre&s;ume not worthy remark.</P>
<P>Juliet, bating too quick a &s;u&s;ceptibility of love, is a mo&s;t amiable lady; &s;he is tender, affectionate and con&s;tant; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liberal &s;entiments and deli|cate feelings; rather romantic in &s;ome notions, but ju&s;tifiably &s;o from age and &s;ituation of mind; &s;en&s;i|ble of filial duty, yet not firm enough in oppo&s;ing it to pa&s;&s;ion; her circum&s;tances are deeply affecting and her cata&s;trophe &s;piritedly affectionate, though as an act of &s;uicide not very moral.</P>
<P>The competition between Mrs. CIBBER and Mrs BELLAMY, who had both great merit in this cha|racter, &s;eemed nearly to admit the &s;ame &s;tate of compari&s;on as we have adopted for the contending
<PB N="193" REF="207">
heroes; one excelled in amorous rapture, the other called every power of di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pair to her aid; Mrs. BELLAMY was an object of love, Mrs. CIB|BER of admiration; Mrs. BELLAMY's execution was more natural, Mrs. CIBBER's more forceable; in the former there were traces of nonage; in the latter too much of the woman.</P>
<P>Lady Capulet is no body, yet we once &s;aw Mrs. PRITCHARD make her re&s;pectable; mi&s;tre&s;s nur&s;e, to whom we have objected, as a character incon|&s;i&s;tent with tragedy, though highly fini&s;hed from nature; was mo&s;t admirably repre&s;ented by Mrs. MACKLIN, and we think her petulant impertinence is very well &s;upported by Mrs. PITT; upon the whole, this play is in a truly deplorable &s;tate of action at pre&s;ent in both hou&s;es; and as, &s;ixteen years ago, it was hard to &s;ay which company excelled mo&s;t, the contention now &s;eems to be, who are mo&s;t con|temptible.</P>
<P>Romeo and Juliet, though it exhibits none of the towring flights of genius, yet has many poetical beau|ties, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;mooth, nervous, agreeable ver|&s;ification; and takes, in &s;everal places, tender po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ions; it conveys very in&s;tructive admonitions, ri&s;es by ju&s;t degrees to a &s;triking con|clu&s;ion, and mu&s;t be allowed the candid prai&s;e of great merit, whether &s;een in public or peru&s;ed in private.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROVOK'D HUSBAND. A COMEDY. Altered from VANBURGH by CIBBER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Laureat, in his preface to this play, has taken con&s;iderable pains to do Sir John ju&s;tice, by attributing the plan and mo&s;t of the characters ori|ginally to him; however, a compari&s;on between the PROVOK'D HUSBAND and Vanburgh's <HI>Journey to London</HI> will prove, that Cibber &s;hewed great judgment and ta&s;te in the u&s;e of tho&s;e materials which fortunately fell into his hands.</P>
<P>Though &s;oliloquy is perhaps not the mo&s;t com|mendable opening of a play, yet what Lord Town|ley offers at the beginning of this comedy, lets an audience well into the grounds of that unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;its heavy on his mind; the alarm he ex|pre&s;&s;es at the danger his wife's reputation is in from her cour&s;e of life, conveys a very in&s;tructive intimation to ladies in the gay world; and his chu&s;ing calm mea&s;ures fir&s;t to effect a reformation, &s;hews a generous, prudent, tender ca&s;t of mind. &mdash;The &s;cene with lady Townly exhibits much &s;pirited gentility, the debate is carried on with great good manners on both &s;ides, and a happy pre&s;ervation of temper is maintained; for though his lord&s;hip warms a little, yet it is like a man of &s;en&s;e and rank; his mode of pre&s;enting the bill is delicate, and her manner of receiving it plea&s;antly
<PB N="195" REF="209">
whim&s;ical, as is indeed all &s;he &s;ays through the re|mainder of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The &s;hort conver&s;ation between lord Townly and lady Grace is well conducted, and mention of Manly falls in aptly, of whom both give a good preparative character; I cannot, however, help being of opinion, that this gentleman rather &s;eems too forward in advi&s;ing rigid treatment, when lord Townly a&s;ks his advice; neverthele&s;s, it occa&s;ions a &s;en&s;ible and in&s;tructive altercation between him and lady Grace, who argues again&s;t her own opinion, that &s;he may come more effectually at his.&mdash;This &s;cene takes a very agreeable turn, where Sir Francis Wronghead and his family are mentioned, of whom Manly gives a &s;atirical and laughable ac|count, &s;hewing that he has a generous concern for their welfare, though he cannot avoid de&s;pi&s;ing their folly.</P>
<P>If introducing &s;uch a per&s;on as John Moody in|to the pre&s;ence of a nobleman and his &s;i&s;ter can be ju&s;tified, it may be truly &s;aid, that he gives great life to the &s;cene, both from peculiarity of dialect and &s;entiment; as to the propriety of his appear|ance, we cannot think there is any breach of de|corum; Lord Townly being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;en&s;ible affability, and having his curio&s;ity rai&s;ed by Man|ly's picture of the Wronghead family, might very well wave general di&s;tinctions in favour of hone&s;t John; who &s;eems one of tho&s;e unpoli&s;hed, natural productions well worth inve&s;tigation; if quality, which is too often the ca&s;e, never &s;toops to a view of the lower ranks of life, but, like a lion, with
<PB N="196" REF="210">
&s;upercilious ab&s;traction, &s;talks only in its own cir|cle, it mu&s;t be very deficient in a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branch of knowledge.&mdash;Human nature is a volume of great variety, and he who &s;tudies it mo&s;t, is mo&s;t likely to be practically wi&s;e; wherefore we heartily join with lady Grace, in
<Q REND="inline">"loving nature let her dre&s;s be never &s;o homely."</Q></P>
<P>Moody's familiar &s;alutation of Manly, his inti|mation that his lady is in great good-humour from a free circulation of ca&s;h; his account of the equi|page; the di&s;po&s;ition of the younger children at Joan Grow&s;e's; the misfortune of the coach, its contents of live lumber within, and non-e&s;&s;ential lumber without; the cargo of provi&s;ions, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cro&s;s events, and the &s;uper&s;titious &s;tre&s;s he lays on Childermas-day, are ludicrous to the highe&s;t degree, and as highly a fini&s;hed piece of dramatic painting, as we have ever met with; nor can any thing be more in character than where John gives him&s;elf &s;uch &s;uperiority over his ma&s;ter, as a &s;hrewd and re&s;olute hu&s;band; indeed every line of this &s;cene &s;hews a rich vein of uniform hu|mour.</P>
<P>After John's departure, the other characters are called off in an ea&s;y, commendable manner, by lady Grace's propo&s;ition of cards, which occurs from the di&s;cour&s;e without any appearance of de|&s;ign.&mdash;Manly's &s;hort &s;oliloquy contains &s;ome deli|cate remarks, and any where but concluding an act of a comedy, we &s;hould &s;ay the following lines had merit; but rhime on the &s;tage is certainly abominable, except in prologues and epilogues.</P>

<P>One of tho&s;e worthy gentlemen,
<Q REND="inline">"who&s;e oc|ca&s;ional chariots,"</Q>
according to the count's own phra&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"roll upon the four aces,"</Q> is pre|&s;ented to us at the beginning of the &s;econd act, with an old lady who lets lodgings; the &s;harper, like all of his kind, from a duke to a link-boy, &s;eems bent upon his own emolument at any rate; from his recommending Sir Francis's family to lodgings calculated for that purpo&s;e, and his con|ver&s;ation with Mrs. Motherly, a very in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on may be drawn, of the caution which &s;hould be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to placing confidence of a &s;erious nature in per&s;ons who are only externally known to us; the Count's intrigue with Myrtilla is mentioned with a proper degree of impatience by her aunt, but if &s;he had left out, or &s;oftened the following remark, it would have been better: when the Count &s;ays he will marry her neice, the reply runs thus,&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"Very likely!&mdash;If you would not do it when &s;he was a maid; your &s;tomach is not &s;o &s;harp &s;et now, I pre&s;ume."</Q>
The &s;cheme &s;truck out between the&s;e worthy per&s;onages is infamou&s;ly politic, and I believe entirely con&s;i&s;|tent with a depravation of nature too frequent in life.&mdash;Ba&s;&s;et's &s;hort &s;cene with Myrtilla only con|firms her imprudent conduct, and conveys rather gro&s;s ideas.&mdash;Her &s;oliloquy contains truth, but not very proper to be told upon a &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="212">Lady Wronghead's ignorant affectation of po|litene&s;s is extremely well de&s;cribed in her fir&s;t ap|pearance; and Sir Francis's ru&s;ticated ob&s;ervations upon introducing his &s;on and daughter are an ex|cellent preparation for a more intimate acqaintance with his character; nor are the young &s;quire and his &s;i&s;ter le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sfully delineated in what they &s;ay.&mdash;The unpoli&s;hed roughne&s;s of the boy, coun|tenanced through &s;ympathy by his father; and the pert, pettled forwardne&s;s of the girl, equally &s;up|ported by the mother, exhibit a mo&s;t diverting picture of parents fooli&s;hly indulgent, and children con&s;equently ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Manly's &s;cene with Sir Francis is pregnant with genuine humour, and &s;hews the baronet in a very entertaining view of &s;tupid &s;elf-&s;ufficiency; his &s;cheme of repairing his fortune by parliamentary connections, both ju&s;tifies his title to the name of Wronghead, and gives a very keen &s;troke of ob|lique &s;atire to that abominable practice of pro&s;titut|ing the legi&s;lative capacity to mercenary private views; it is impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to be better applied, or if rightly taken, more u&s;eful than the ridicule here thrown in a ma&s;terly manner upon both the knaves and fools of policy; Manly's ob|&s;ervations are all poignant without the lea&s;t degree of &s;uperfluity, and lead Sir Francis into a whim&s;i|cal, involuntary explanation of his de&s;igns; his treatment of Ba&s;&s;et &s;hews the gentleman and man of penetration; while the gambler's unmeaning familiarity exhibits contra&s;ted an empty, imperti|nent coxcomb.&mdash;Agreeable, however, to tho&s;e &s;u|perficial
<PB N="199" REF="213">
notions of gentility, formed by her &s;hal|low lady&s;hip.&mdash;His con&s;cious feeling of Manly's &s;u&s;picion is very natural to an unprincipled ra&s;cal, and his retreat well-timed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e remarks made upon Manly by Mi&s;s and her mama are extremely &s;uitable to weak females, who too often mi&s;take plain-dealing for rudene&s;s and ill humour; her lady&s;hip's contempt of pe|cuniary expectations is al&s;o very con&s;i&s;tent with a vain heart, elevated by vi&s;ionary greatne&s;s, and her intention of throwing a rub in the way of Manly's marriage with lady Grace, manife&s;ts a mi&s;chievous bent, which littlene&s;s of mind is ever prone to. Dick's impatient call of appetite, the introduction of a full tankard, the con&s;equent remarks, and John Moody's account of the misfortune their coach has met with, all happily concur to give this &s;cene peculiar &s;pirit.&mdash;But we wi&s;h John had not retained the carter's expre&s;&s;ion of <Q REND="inline">"ki&s;&s;ing,"</Q> &amp;c. &mdash;The young &s;quire's advice of bringing him be|fore the parliament, is an admirable &s;ting to the perver&s;ion of privilege.</P>
<P>Lord Townly and lady Grace begin the third act with &s;ome ju&s;t remarks on fa&s;hionable exce&s;&s;es; from which their conver&s;ation, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, turns upon Manly, when we meet with the effect of lady Wronghead's policy in a letter concerning that gentleman; lady Grace's communication of it to her brother is commendable, and his &s;lowne&s;s to entertain a bad opinion without better grounds, added to his remark, that
<Q REND="inline">"unknown friends for the
<PB N="200" REF="214">
mo&s;t part prove &s;ecret enemies,"</Q>
&s;hews not only goodne&s;s of heart, but a knowledge of life al&s;o: the &s;equent interview between lady Grace and Manly is a piece of colloquial delicacy much to be admired; the explanation which the lady is in want of, ri&s;es upon her by very ju&s;t degrees; the gallant ju&s;tifies him&s;elf upon the principles of con&s;cious in|nocence, which occa&s;ions an eclairci&s;&s;ement that a|greeably embarra&s;&s;es his mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Her &s;oliloquy af|ter he goes off, contains &s;entiments worthy of vir|tuous &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Lord and lady Townly are well introduced by Tru&s;ty's account of them; they are both warmed by difference of opinion, and &s;upport their &s;everal arguments with characteri&s;tic &s;pirit; &s;he takes the lead in ju&s;tifying her own di&s;&s;ipated life, and he very pathetically refutes her flim&s;y a&s;&s;ertions, which gives ri&s;e to a &s;erious turn of repartee; it appears, greatly to his lord&s;hip's credit, that neither the pre|judice of his own circum&s;tances, nor the &s;olitary life he leads, weighs &s;o much with him as a jea|lous apprehen&s;ion of his lady's reputation; feeling &s;trongly, as we may &s;uppo&s;e, Cae&s;ar's excellent maxim, that a wife &s;hould not even be &s;u&s;pected; that critical point of re&s;entment to which the alter|cation ri&s;es, parting from her, carries him off the &s;tage with re&s;pect, and leaves her in a kind of maze, but in&s;en&s;ibility coming to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;oon ba|ni&s;hes u&s;eful reflection.</P>
<P>Lady Grace's appearance gives the fine lady a fre&s;h opportunity of indulging her flow of &s;pirits,
<PB N="201" REF="215">
which &s;he does in a vein of great plea&s;antry, by de|&s;cribing what &s;he ironically calls the comforts of matrimony; her pictures of life, and raillery of lady Grace's grave turn, are as entertaining effu&s;ions of a volatile imagination, as any our Engli&s;h dra|ma affords; and in&s;truction is very well mingled with mirth in the prudent remarks delivered by the &s;ingle lady to the married one.</P>
<P>Lord Townly, calmed from the occa&s;ional impe|tuo&s;ity we &s;aw him touched with lately, appears in conference with his friend; after a full and &s;atisfac|tory explanation of lady Wronghead's mean device to prejudice Manly's character; his Lord&s;hip a&s;&s;ures that gentleman of his &s;i&s;ter's affectionate e&s;teem, and ratifies Manly's wi&s;hes with his own warm approba|tion.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very generous, after &s;uch de|&s;igned injury upon &s;o tender a point, in Manly's re|&s;olution of &s;aving the Wronghead family from ruin, even again&s;t their own inclinations&mdash;there is al&s;o a turn of con&s;iderable natural beauty at the conclu&s;ion of this &s;cene, where lord Townly adverts to his own &s;ituation, and mentions Manly's pro&s;pect of &s;uperior happine&s;s; we think the act would have ended bet|ter without the couplet, which is tagged to it, though pretty enough&mdash;for the &s;ubject and &s;enti|ment are compleated with the&s;e words&mdash;
<Q REND="inline">"how much the choice of temper is preferable to beauty."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Motherly and her niece informs us at the beginning of the fourth act, that worthy Count Ba&s;&s;et has palmed a forged note of five hundred

<P>The Count's di&s;&s;ertation in &s;oliloquy, upon a&s;|&s;umed rank and &s;harping principles, is admirable; we heartily wi&s;h what follows, was con&s;picuou&s;ly hung up, in every capital gaming hou&s;e throughout the kingdom&mdash;

<P>The conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;es between Manly and lady Grace, at the beginning of the fifth act, gives us a good and nece&s;&s;ary idea, of the intere&s;ting cri&s;is his lady's conduct has brought things to in lord Townly's family; and their mutual de&s;ire of miti|gating matters, furni&s;hes a favourable picture of their friendly feelings.</P>

are very artfully left in &s;u&s;pence at the end of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;es between lady Townly and Tru&s;ty at the toilet, manife&s;ts the very e&s;&s;ence of fa&s;hionable in&s;en&s;ibility, a vacant head, and a callous heart&mdash; the de&s;cription of what pa&s;&s;ed the night before is inimitable&mdash;taking the money from Poundage, &s;hews a di&s;hone&s;t meanne&s;s which an infatuation to gaming, and a want of money will &s;ubject the high|e&s;t, as well as lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of life to; it points out too, mo&s;t &s;atirically, the light in which trade&s;men, and their circum&s;tances are held in, by many of the gay world, who, being unprincipled them&s;elves, think none of inferior rank in life have any right to, or occa&s;ion for punctual integrity.</P>
<P>The &s;quabble between Poundage and the mercer, is mo&s;t happily imagined, for bringing lord Townly on with the true dignity of an honourable nobleman; which is far above a right honourable knave; and an injured hu&s;band; one provocation is excellently grafted upon another, to ju&s;tify the violent agitation he appears in; and his fir&s;t reproach to the lady, &s;trikes home at one mainpoint of di&s;grace, her di&s;&s;ipa|ted folly brings on him; his arguments are keen, yet con&s;i&s;tent with decorum, and &s;pirited without being outrageous; while her replies, con&s;i&s;ting of faint &s;allies of fal&s;e wit, evidently &s;how the badne&s;s of her cau&s;e, and give his lord&s;hip &s;uch openings for con|viction, as afford rea&s;on, triumphant admi&s;&s;ion to bear down all her principles, but &s;ome embers of pride, which light into a &s;hort flame.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="220">The cri&s;is to which matters are brought when Man|ly and lady Grace appear alarms attention, and even throws &s;ome gleams of pity on the character of her infatuated lady&s;hip; here the pathetic truly ri&s;es upon us, and while we tremble for the unhappy wife, we mu&s;t applaud and &s;ympathize with the determined hu&s;|band, who paints the guilt, and pronounces &s;entence with all the tender firmne&s;s of a ju&s;t and humane judge.</P>
<P>Lady Townly's feelings of remor&s;e advance up|on us in a plea&s;ing, becau&s;e an unexpected manner, and &s;o much as we have blamed her errors, we are al&s;o prepared to receive her &s;en&s;ible recantation, which works that happy, agreeable effect upon his lord&s;hip it mu&s;t do upon every generous mind; as indi&s;cretion is the highe&s;t crime chargeable again&s;t her, the arguments of exculpation &s;he offers are very admi&s;&s;ible, and the effect of reconciliation is, I pre&s;ume, to the wi&s;h of every auditor; in &s;hort, this turn of affairs, &s;o gradually, and with &s;uch probability brought about, is far &s;uperior to Sir John Vanburgh's original &s;ugge&s;tion of turning the lady out of doors.&mdash;The hu&s;band's authority is well maintained as the piece now &s;tands, without any exertion of hardening &s;everity, which may &s;tartle, but generally renders vice more ob&s;tinate.</P>
<P>Though the fir&s;t part of the ma&s;querade &s;cene is, for &s;ake of reducing the play to more bearable compa&s;s, u&s;ually omitted, yet it contains many ex|cellent &s;trokes of &s;atire; what follows de&s;erves particular attention and prai&s;e; in re&s;pect of tho&s;e

<Q REND="inline">"Oh, if it was not expen&s;ive, the better would not come into it; and becau&s;e money can purcha&s;e a Ticket, the common people &s;corn to be left out of it."</Q></P>
<P>Ba&s;&s;et's choice of the ma&s;querade for perpetrat|ing his ba&s;e de&s;igns, is not only natural to &s;uch a character, but al&s;o points out the danger of &s;uch a rendezvous, where vice or villainy may play their game under cover; Manly's &s;cheme of friendly detection is judiciou&s;ly laid, the Wronghead family are well re&s;cued, and &s;trict poetical ju&s;tice is done by obliging the &s;harper to marry one he has de|bauched, and would have impo&s;ed on an un&s;u&s;pect|ing country lad.</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;cene, which is indeed but merely a conclu&s;ion, contains nothing more than a more for|mal exchange of matrimonial engagements between lady Grace and Manly; as it was nece&s;&s;ary to in|troduce the &s;erious characters once more, we appre|hend tho&s;e lines which Lady Townly &s;peaks at the end of their reconciliation &s;cene, would have been much better re&s;erved to the la&s;t; indeed tho&s;e rhimes which at pre&s;ent conclude the piece, are only an enlargement of the &s;ame thought.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="222">This comedy, though not &s;trictly conformable to the nice&s;t rules of time and place, is neverthe|le&s;s &s;ufficiently regular; the &s;cenes are well ar|ranged, the &s;erious and ludicrous happily mingled; the plot well dige&s;ted, and the cata&s;trophe much to be admired; the language of the polite characters is ea&s;y and nervous, of the lower ones humorous and &s;pirited: the &s;entiments are adequate and in|&s;tructive, &s;eldom tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon delicacy, and the moral is a mo&s;t excellent one, &s;hewing how follies of a different nature involve dome&s;tic concerns in dif|ferent perplexities.</P>
<P>Lord Townly is a character of very amiable qualifications, &s;en&s;ible, polite, generous, tender and re&s;olute, preferring indulgence, till he finds pernicious effects ari&s;ing from it; his provocations are intere&s;ting and often repeated, yet all borne with patience, till the honour and dignity of a hu&s;band &s;eem too much endangered, and every trace of di&s;cretion, on the female &s;ide, vani&s;hes.</P>

one is profe&s;&s;edly called an alteration of another&mdash; our critici&s;ms are meant to be as plain and u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible; our de&s;ire being much more bent upon &s;hew|ing a knowledge of nature, and an intention of pro|moting &s;ocial welfare, than pedantically to di&s;play learning in multiplied conjectures, upon immaterial pa&s;&s;ages, which from being temporary, become ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>CYRUS opens with Mandane, daughter of A&s;ty|ages; and A&s;pa&s;ia, daughter of Harpagus; the for|mer, who lo&s;t a &s;on, and thought him murdered twenty years ago, mentions, that &s;he expects within the day to &s;ee her child; her impatience at his deli|berate approach is well expre&s;&s;ed, and paints a mo|ther's feelings, &s;o &s;ituated, in ju&s;t colours&mdash;from what pa&s;&s;es we find, that A&s;tyages, his grandfather, who had devoted this Cyrus to death, while an in|fant, now &s;eems to countenance his public appearance: the old monarch's determining to &s;acrifice the young prince, even before his birth, becau&s;e of a dream which portended his u&s;urpation of the kingdom, &s;hews him ridiculou&s;ly &s;uper&s;titious, and unpardon|ably cruel.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;cene we al&s;o learn, that Camby&s;es was bani&s;hed to prevent Mandane's having any more chil|dren; however, we think A&s;pa&s;ia's mentioning what the prince&s;s had known &s;o very long, and ruminated on &s;o much, is merely making her a tool for opening the plot; we are told too, that Mandane, though her &s;on counts twenty, is her&s;elf but thirty-two: this may plea&s;e a capital actre&s;s, as few ladies like to ac|knowledge
<PB N="218" REF="232">
even that age, till a dozen or fourteen years older; but is at any rate a very trifling circum|&s;tance to mention. A&s;pa&s;ia al&s;o tells Mandane ano|ther circum&s;tance already well known to her, and much better mentioned afterwards; indeed it is &s;ome introduction to Harpagus, but we wi&s;h the plot did not open &s;o mechanically.</P>
<P>By Harpagus it appears, that Cyrus is arrived up|on the borders of the kingdom, but mu&s;t not pa&s;s them till A&s;tyages's permi&s;&s;ion is &s;ignified; this very ju&s;tly &s;timulates maternal impatience, and occa&s;ions Man|dane, as it is improper for her to appear in per&s;on, to &s;end A&s;pa&s;ia for intelligence of who the prince re|&s;embles; if, however, &s;he had only mentioned a likene&s;s of his father, without remembring her&s;elf, the &s;troke would have been more delicately natural&mdash;be&s;ides the choice of her me&s;&s;enger is not, we apprehend, quite ju&s;tifiable; as things are circum&s;tanced, Har|pagus would certainly have been much fitter than his daughter: however, he &s;tays to give the prince&s;s &s;ome gleams of double joy, the return of her hu&s;|band, as well as &s;on, which he only hints; and for what rea&s;on &s;uch ob&s;curity is a&s;&s;umed, we cannot perceive, unle&s;s the &s;tate&s;man &s;uppo&s;es Mandane in|capable of keeping a &s;ecret, however important to her&s;elf; or thinks happine&s;s better admini&s;tered by halves: the lady neverthele&s;s is &s;atisfied with the bare &s;ugge&s;tion, nor a&s;ks once after probability, tho' Harpagus a&s;&s;igns no rea&s;on for his my&s;terious re|&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="233">The &s;tate&s;man in his &s;oliloquy intimates, that re|venge for a murdered &s;on enflames his brea&s;t, and that he wears an out&s;ide &s;how of loyalty to make ven|geance more &s;ecure. We could have wi&s;hed that the une&s;&s;ential ob&s;olete Scottici&s;m <HI>ken,</HI> though admitted by &s;ome leading authors, had not been u&s;ed in the la&s;t line: to imitate the beauties of capital writers is very commendable, but peculiarities are much better left to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We find from what Cyrus mentions at his en|trance, that Mithranes, his &s;uppo&s;ed father, has made him acquainted with his real origin; here a que&s;tion obviou&s;ly ari&s;es, why the old man &s;hould &s;o &s;oon diclo&s;e this &s;ecret, which it &s;eems &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary to keep; &s;ince we cannot perceive that commu|nicating it tends at all to forward the prince's hap|pine&s;s, nay rather unnece&s;&s;arily changes his tran|quil &s;tate to agitated perplexity; a piece of u&s;eful information, however, accrues, which is that an im|po&s;tor has u&s;urped his name, and is ready to impo&s;e upon A&s;tyages; the dream of that old monarch is told by Cyrus to Mithranes, who knew it, and the con&s;equences, before his birth; this again &s;eems &s;trange fi&s;hing for revelation of a plot; but what fol|lows from where Mithranes takes up the &s;tory is mo&s;t agreeably imagined, and &s;uitably expre&s;&s;ed; the reception of Cyrus in his infant &s;tate, doomed to death by a &s;avage parent, is pathetic, with beauti|ful &s;implicity; and the prince's de&s;ire of paying &s;ome tributary drops to the memory of her, who adopted and took care of him as a &s;on, &s;peaks ten|der

laudable gratitude; the following part of this &s;cene apologizes for a cautious, underhand method of working, by repre&s;enting the affected contrition of A&s;tyages &s;u&s;picious, as a proof of which, his &s;a|crificing Harpagus's &s;on, upon &s;uppo&s;ition, that the father had &s;aved Cyrus, is very judiciou&s;ly of|fered; that &s;peech wherein Cyrus &s;eems eager to a&s;&s;ert his right, &s;hews a plea&s;ing glow of &s;pirited imagination, and the two la&s;t lines of it contain a &s;entiment of intrin&s;ic merit.</P>
<Q><L>That king will never guard his people's rights,</L>
<L>Who wants the courage to a&s;&s;ert his own.</L></Q>
<P>This is a truth no man can deny; but lea&s;t re&s;o|lution &s;hould become ra&s;hne&s;s, and firmne&s;s ob&s;ti|nacy; a monarch ought, without the aid of falla|cious courtiers, to know the exact barrier of &s;epa|ration between his own royal prerogative, and ju&s;t popular privileges; filial duty &s;eems to make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the young prince; an impa|tient, natural de&s;ire of &s;eeing his unknown parents animates, but the cool advice of Mithranes checks him into a prudent and &s;olemn promi&s;e to keep him&s;elf concealed under the name of Alcaeus and his &s;on, till fit occa&s;ion &s;erves.</P>
<P>Where the old man touches upon reproof, and retracts, as being no longer in the character of a parent, with Cyrus's grateful, tender reply, are beautiful pa&s;&s;ages, as is al&s;o what follows;
<Q><L>&mdash;I will &s;eek yon hallow'd roof, to rai&s;e</L>

<P>There is nothing more becoming of human na|ture than a ju&s;t, reverential reliance on providence: <HI>to begin every deed with heaven,</HI> is worthy a &s;ound under&s;tanding, a great mind, and a pious heart; therefore the author who inculcates &s;uch a principle, without the lea&s;t taint of enthu&s;ia&s;m; who expre&s;&s;es it, with &s;uch a noble engaging &s;implicity as Mr. HOOLE has here done, commands the approbation of religion, morality and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;peech of Harpagus, which acquaints us, that A&s;tyages has &s;ent him to enquire whether his grand&s;on is arrived, we find an unpardonable grammatical &s;lip.</P>

<P>By this tran&s;po&s;ition and change of a word concord is pre&s;erved, without rendering the &s;en&s;e weaker, or the ver&s;ification le&s;s harmonious.</P>
<P>From the conver&s;ation of Mithranes and Harpa|gus it appears, that A&s;tyages bears his grand&s;on no great good will, wherefore they determine that an impo&s;tor, who has u&s;urped his name, &s;hall fall in the way of tho&s;e perils aimed at the real Cyrus; the remark which Harpagus makes, that Media's
<PB N="222" REF="236">
heir has been trained up to virtue in her &s;afe&s;t &s;chool, an humble &s;tation, is pretty, but not de|fen&s;ible; becau&s;e the virtues to adorn and &s;upport a throne require practical knowledge of life; he who knows not vice, nor has any opportunity of running into it, can po&s;&s;e&s;s but negative virtue at be&s;t; to be &s;urrounded with temptation, yet &s;till to &s;oar above it, is the true purity of mind; a man who cannot get &s;trong liquors claims no merit from &s;o|briety, nor a female locked in a cloi&s;ter from cha|&s;tity; po&s;itive virtue is the child of free election, and, we apprehend, whatever plea&s;ing pictures may be drawn from education totally ab&s;tracted, not one in a hundred of &s;uch characters would make a tolerable king, or even a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety; &s;peculation pre&s;ents us with many ideas very plea&s;ing, which practice immediately proves chimerical.</P>
<P>The approach of Camby&s;es is again intimated, and they &s;eparate, lea&s;t from the king's jealous temper of mind &s;ome dangerous con&s;equences might ari&s;e.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, Mithranes expre&s;&s;es apprehen&s;ions for the ab&s;ence of Cyrus, but is interrupted by the appearance of Camby&s;es, whom he knows, though in di&s;gui&s;e, yet does not &s;eem to know; the &s;tranger &s;olicits guidance to A&s;tarte's altar, where a grand annual &s;acrifice is that day to be held, which the old man promi&s;es, and mentions the expected appearance of Cyrus; &s;ome explanation &s;eems approaching, when the &s;udden
<PB N="223" REF="237">
appearance of A&s;tyages makes it nece&s;&s;ary for Camby&s;es to retire.</P>
<P>The gloomy monarch &s;ounds Mithranes's attach|ment on the principle of gratitude, which is ac|knowledged.&mdash;On mention of Cyrus's being pre|&s;erved, Mithranes takes an extraordinary alarm; we &s;ay extraordinary, becau&s;e there is no rea&s;on to imagine, from his cordial beginning, that A&s;tyages means any other than the fictitious character of Cy|rus; indeed, he explains it immediately after; the li&s;tening of Camby&s;es is a mo&s;t pitiful conde&s;cen|tion in any per&s;on of his rank; though mi&s;appre|hen&s;ion of Mithranes's accepting the murtherous charge gives ri&s;e to &s;omewhat intere&s;ting afterwards. The old man's mentioning Cyrus under the name of Alcaeus, to perpetrate the monarch's command, is natural and politic.</P>
<P>The paternal impatience of Camby&s;es which hur|ries him into the path of de&s;truction on his &s;on's ac|count, is affectionate and noble; his appearance, and the danger con&s;equent thereto, mu&s;t agitate feeling &s;pectators con&s;iderably; the circum&s;tance of being taken pri&s;oner affords him a good opportu|nity of &s;hewing an invincible &s;pirit, which cau&s;es a di&s;covery of his real character, and furni&s;hes him with reproaches of a very &s;tinging nature again&s;t his cruel father-in-law.</P>
<P>As tyrannic guilt is ever trembling for its own &s;afety, his threats of fatal nature might rea&s;onably be expected, as al&s;o Camby&s;es's contempt of them. &mdash;The charge of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Cyrus is well levelled and &s;trikes home al&s;o: the hint he throws out of
<PB N="224" REF="238">
vengeance hanging over the royal per&s;ecutor is well imagined; in &s;hort, both characters are ex|cellently contra&s;ted through the whole &s;cene, con|fident innocence buoys up one, cumbrous guilt &s;taggers the other.</P>
<P>Camby&s;es departs with becoming &s;pirit and moral dignity, leaving A&s;tyages pregnant with appre|hen&s;ion of lurking dangers.&mdash;In about fifteen lines after her hu&s;band's being carried off a pri&s;oner, Mandane appears po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his di&s;agreeable &s;itua|tion, which &s;eems a violent breach of probability; being ab&s;ent twenty years, &s;he but thirteen when he was bani&s;hed, how does the prince&s;s &s;o &s;uddenly, amid&s;t &s;uch bu&s;tling circum&s;tances, know him? Or, if he was pointed out to her as the per&s;on, is it po&s;&s;ible to imagine but after &s;o long an ab&s;ence &s;he would have forced an interview with him for an exchange of mutual tenderne&s;s; as it is, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has flown by him without taking the lea&s;t notice; a pa&s;&s;age in the third act intimates &s;he has not &s;een him; if not, who has told her &s;o &s;uddenly of his &s;ituation? The application to her father is of a very tender, per&s;ua&s;ive nature, much in favour of capital performance, and conduct|ed without running into bomba&s;tic extravagance, like that of Almeria in the Mourning Bride, when &s;he pleads for O&s;myn in the fourth act of that play.</P>
<P>A&s;tyages endeavours to alarm her feelings as a daughter, by acquainting her of the danger he ap|prehends &s;urrounding him, yet grants &s;ecurity of life to the pri&s;oner, in compliance with her tears; but expre&s;&s;es a firm re&s;olution of renewing his ba|ni&s;hment.&mdash;The king no &s;ooner departs than Cyrus
<PB N="225" REF="239">
appears, whom Mandane charges with breaking <HI>importunely</HI> on her grief&mdash;the word <HI>importunely</HI> we can by no means approve.</P>
<P>Cyrus's apology for &s;o unceremonious an ap|proach, is danger which cour&s;es him at the heels; dangers which ari&s;es, according to his own ac|count, from &s;elf-defence; the &s;ympathy of blood is hinted at in Mandane's fir&s;t &s;peech to the &s;tartled prince, who tells the circum&s;tance of having re|&s;cued A&s;pa&s;ia from threatened violation, in terms be|comingly mode&s;t; his narration is interrupted by the appearance of that lady, who urges informa|tion how he e&s;caped with life from the danger her &s;afety had involved him in.</P>
<P>Cyrus continues his tale with unadorned truth, and &s;ignifies, by a plea&s;ing degree of natural painting, his antagoni&s;t's fall; the name of Man|dane being mentioned, her &s;on, as we might expect, is &s;truck with amaze; at this very critical period an officer and guards are introduced, who give the &s;cene quite another turn, by arre&s;ting the real Cyrus for having killed the u&s;urper of his name. Tho&s;e beams of pity which &s;o lately lightened over Man|dane's brea&s;t, now turn to the clouds of rage a|gain&s;t him who appears the murtherer of her &s;on; Cyrus's &s;olemn oath to Mithranes prevents his re|vealing him&s;elf; &s;trong grief &s;ways the mother, anxiety for her perturbation agitates the &s;on, while A&s;pa&s;ia feels commendable, grateful concern for the unhappy &s;ituation of her deliverer.</P>
<P>Mandane, unable to expre&s;s or bear her compli|cated mi&s;eries, hurries off with a &s;peech expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="226" REF="240">
&s;ome touches of frenzy; A&s;pa&s;ia's open, unre|&s;erved declaration of apprehen&s;ion for Cyrus's &s;afety, &s;hews much genero&s;ity of temper, even admitting what &s;he her&s;elf, after he is gone, hints at, love for his per&s;on; this lady's &s;oliloquy con|cludes the &s;econd act, with tolerable &s;pirit, but we mu&s;t be of opinion, that the &s;cene throughout is much more intere&s;ting from its circum&s;tances than expre&s;&s;ion; the former have too great a &s;imilitude to Merope, and the latter falls far beneath the im|pa&s;&s;ioned ideas of that tragedy; though Mr. Hoole has happily avoided the &s;trained, metaphorical ver|&s;ification, which incumbers Aaron Hill's brilliancy of imagination.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, Mithranes, dreading Mandane's re&s;entment again&s;t Cyrus as Alcaeus, informs her of the &s;ecret &s;o long kept from her; but at the &s;ame time warns again&s;t an indulgence of tho&s;e tran&s;ports which might di&s;co|cover it to her father; maternal joy for having found a &s;on &s;o long lo&s;t, and &s;o lately to all appear|rance killed, is con&s;iderably damped by the &s;itua|tion of Camby&s;es; from &s;ome breaks it appears, that Mithranes's prudent re&s;triction is nece&s;&s;ary to re|&s;train Mandane; the heart violently agitated is ever prone inadvertently to di&s;clo&s;e, what undi&s;turbed caution would teach it to conceal; wherefore in &s;uch ca&s;es a friend's a&s;&s;i&s;tance becomes e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>A&s;tyages, true to his villainous principles, &s;eems much plea&s;ed at, and grateful for, the death of him he &s;uppo&s;es his grand&s;on; this affords Mi|thranes a good opportunity to con&s;ult the &s;afety of

Cyrus, as Alcaeus, which the king promi&s;es.&mdash; tyrant-like, in his &s;oliloquy, he determines to &s;acrifice tho&s;e who have contributed to his murderous pur|po&s;es; hence ari&s;e fre&s;h fears for the prince, on whom death &s;eems to have conceived innumerable and almo&s;t unavoidable attacks.</P>
<P>Harpagus comes in &s;ea&s;onably to avert &s;ome im|pending ills from our hero, by &s;hewing him&s;elf warm in his attachment to A&s;tyages; A&s;pa&s;ia's &s;up|plication in favour of Alcaeus works an alarm in her father's brea&s;t; introducing Cyrus to A&s;tyages as a pri&s;oner &s;erves no purpo&s;e that we can per|ceive, except giving ri&s;e to a &s;peech beautifully &s;en&s;ible: when A&s;tyages makes a favourable remark on the prince's per&s;onal appearance, the &s;tate&s;man thus emphatically replies;
<Q><L>Appearance oft deceives; not always does</L>
<L>The poli&s;h'd court di&s;play the faire&s;t forms;</L>
<L>And in the &s;imple ru&s;tic's homely cell,</L>
<L>Nature &s;ometimes a&s;&s;umes a namele&s;s grace,</L>
<L>Which greatne&s;s cannot reach.</L></Q></P>
<P>Harpagus's ungracious addre&s;s to Cyrus, when he approaches the king, is al&s;o politically calculated to turn a&s;ide any &s;u&s;picion of a di&s;gui&s;ed character; but why A&s;tyages &s;hould call the &s;on of Mithranes a per&s;on of lowly birth, or why A&s;pa&s;ia, in her &s;oliloquy at the end of the &s;econd act, &s;hould hint pride's placing her above the offspring of a man who, it appears, had formerly been in favour at court, and obtained the rural retirement he wi&s;hed from royal patronage, is hard to &s;ay: Mithranes, though a voluntary exile from grandeur and bu&s;t|ling

<P>Harpagus's di&s;gui&s;e of his real &s;entiments after A&s;tyages goes off, even to A&s;pa&s;ia, &s;hews cautious integrity; he hints prudently al&s;o his &s;u&s;picion of love in the warmth of his daughter's &s;olicitation, and warns her of a pa&s;&s;ion attended by un&s;een danger. &mdash;Upon her departure, we find the loyal &s;tate&s;man paying cordial homage to his prince; quere, whe|ther freeing Cyrus from his chains does not break in upon the cautious plan he has before pur&s;ued; for &s;uppo&s;e the king was to &s;ee or hear of &s;uch an indulgence &s;hewn to a pri&s;oner, even by the per&s;on who a few minutes before has rather behaved har&s;hly to him, mu&s;t it not wake &s;lumbering &s;u&s;|picion to a &s;tate of dangerous activity?</P>
<P>Paying &s;ome tributary tears to the memory of his own &s;on, and Cyrus's generous &s;ympathy are plea&s;ing tran&s;itions; when Harpagus repre&s;ents private griefs as below the notice of royalty, he draws as fine a declaration of noble humanity from the prince as ever fell from any pen.</P>

Harpagus to renew the charge of &s;ecrecy fir&s;t given by Mithranes; this creates a perplexity in the following &s;cene with Mandane, where &s;he owns him as her &s;on, and he &s;huns her tender approaches, which terminates the act in a critical and intere&s;ting man|mer: however, we cannot help thinking Cyrus's be|haviour to a tender mother, when it appears &s;he has been informed of his identity; a punctuality too ri|gid for nature and probability, his my&s;terous re&s;erve naturally throws her into a &s;tate of dubitation bor|dering on amazement.</P>

<P>That affectionate tran&s;port which a faithful couple, &s;o long parted as Camby&s;es and Mandane, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel, is interrupted by the former's &s;up|po&s;ing his &s;on newly &s;lain; however, he is informed otherwi&s;e, and mutual &s;atisfaction again di&s;plays plea&s;ing beams.

<P>The turn which en&s;ues from Camby&s;es's hearing that Mithranes has informed Mandane of her &s;on's exi&s;tence is truly fine, as thereby the plot gains an alarming intricacy; having heard Mithranes pro|mi&s;e the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Cyrus to A&s;tyages; he very naturally &s;uppo&s;es, that the old man, through ambitious views, wants to palm his own &s;on upon a wi&s;hing, and therefore a credulous mother; of this Mandane is the more readily convinced by re|flecting upon the unintelligible behaviour of the young man in his late interview with her.</P>

<P>A&s;pa&s;ia's mention of Alcaeus, like water upon flames, makes Mandane's fury blaze the higher; and carries her off teeming with the bitterne&s;s of revenge.&mdash;What pa&s;&s;es between A&s;pa&s;ia and Har|pagus appears only calculated to give &s;trong feel|ing a nece&s;&s;ary pau&s;e: however, it is not with|out &s;everal plea&s;ing &s;entiments, agreeably ex|pre&s;&s;ed; the lady's dutiful conde&s;cen&s;ion to her kind father's cordial advice, even though that ad|vice counteracts impa&s;&s;ioned inclination, furni&s;hes the idea of a mo&s;t amiable mind.</P>
<P>Mandane, it appears, has &s;ought out Mithranes, and for &s;ome time di&s;&s;embles her rage, to make it bur&s;t forth with trebled fury, which naturally throws the guiltle&s;s old man into a&s;toni&s;hment; nothing can be more &s;trikingly imagined than the prince&s;s's mi&s;taken triumph, in &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he &s;hall have &s;on for &s;on; Mithranes's di&s;tracted confu&s;ion to think the prince &s;hould be in &s;uch danger, and by a father's hand, fills the humane brea&s;t with terror; this whole &s;cene is wrought up in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly man|ner, and every &s;peech, pathetic, &s;upplicative re|mon&s;trances

on one &s;ide with furious, unbelieving ob&s;tinacy on the other, &s;peaks mo&s;t forceably to the heart, which mu&s;t throb with terror and an|xiety.</P>
<P>When Mithranes goes off, Mandane's mind is thrown into a very different &s;tate of convul&s;ion, we have lately &s;een her filled with rage almo&s;t &s;avage, but behold her now, on Harpagus's a&s;&s;urance that Alcaeus is really Cyrus, plunged into the utmo&s;t poignancy, nay di&s;traction of grief, which barely leaves her power to &s;peak the place and impending mi&s;chief; this &s;ends off Harpagus on the wings of loyalty for prevention; her &s;oliloquy is beau|tifully wild, and we may venture to &s;ay, that no fourth act ever hung an audience more in &s;u&s;pence at its conclu&s;ion, than this does, which we deem a point of infinite merit; if there is any fault, it mu&s;t be, that there is no increa&s;e of feeling left for the &s;cenes which are to come.</P>
<P>The fifth act pre&s;ents us at its commencement with Mandane wandering, &s;he knows not whither, under the impul&s;e of di&s;tracted agitation; to her Mithranes enters, after a fruitle&s;s &s;earch for Cyrus; the mention of who&s;e name occa&s;ions an increa&s;e of his unhappy mother's frenzy; on the return of rea&s;on, &s;he knows Mithranes, and &s;ends him to A&s;|tarte's fountain; Camby&s;es's appearance with his &s;word bloody, &s;trikes every tender idea with appre|hen&s;ion, that he has effected the de&s;truction of his &s;on; and totally overbears afflicted Mandane; Cyrus's entrance, however, gives a fre&s;h turn, though nature &s;till trembles for his danger from a

mi&s;taken father's rage: the lady's &s;ituation &s;hould certainly have claimed &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from her hu&s;band, previous to every other con&s;ideration; when una&s;&s;i&s;ted revival enables her to &s;peak, an ec|clairci&s;&s;ement en&s;ues of a very tender and plea&s;ing nature; yet in expre&s;&s;ion we rather deem it faint; the play &s;hould undoubtedly have been &s;o planned as to have concluded here, yet we find a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s to en&s;ue; A&s;tyages comes unawares upon Camby&s;es and his daughter, the former of whom is again made pri&s;oner; on being informed of a rebellious tumult by Harpagus, the king's rage threatens the late happy couple with death; but they are pre&s;erved by a lucky thought of the &s;tate&s;|man.</P>
<P>Cyrus next appears meditating prettily on his change of fortune, and reveals him&s;elf to A&s;pa&s;ia; this whole &s;cene mu&s;t be deemed non-e&s;&s;ential, and very flat after what has preceded; the prince's de|termination of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his endangered grandfather &s;hews dutiful tenderne&s;s, and a very generous mind; Harpagus, after long &s;mothering revenge for a murdered &s;on, now openly attacks A&s;tyages, and as the event &s;hews they are reciprocally wounded; the royal mon&s;ter dies, with &s;ome gleams of re|pentance, yet &s;trangely languid when compared to his enormous guilt; Harpagus expires recommend|ing his daughter to Cyrus: Camby&s;es and Man|dane now appear; it is to be lamented that, after all her &s;ufferings, a father's death &s;hould render her happine&s;s imperfect.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="248">A&s;pa&s;ia's being totally unprovided for is a great imperfection; Cyrus only recommends her coldly to his mother for comfort, though, in the pre|ceding &s;cene, when &s;he mentions his exaltation, he replies,

<P>Upon a general &s;urvey of this tragedy, we find the plot plea&s;ingly intricate, agreeably regular, and pregnant with many affecting circum&s;tances to the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fifth act; what follows is a mere &s;acrifice to partial ju&s;tice, which, we apprehend, might have been effected with more brevity and merit by &s;ome very practicable tran&s;|po&s;itions of incidents.</P>
<P>The characters of this piece are in no re&s;pect &s;triking; A&s;tyages is a mo&s;t unnatural tyrant, more known by what is &s;poken of him, than by any thing he &s;ays him&s;elf; he is hateful to the au|dience, without any acting merit to a&s;&s;i&s;t the per|former; he is mo&s;t in&s;ipidly vile, timorous, cruel and credulous.&mdash;Mr. CLARKE is much to be pitied when burdened with &s;uch an ungracious load; what can be done for the de&s;picable monarch in action, he does, and certainly de&s;erves the author's thanks.</P>
<P>Camby&s;es is a very odd mixture of &s;omebody and nobody&mdash;here&mdash;there&mdash;and no where; brought from his exile to do nothing&mdash;taken pri&s;oner&mdash;&s;et at liberty in a mo&s;t unaccountable manner; taken

<P>Cyrus is amiable, and utters many &s;entiments worthy a virtuous, well-cultivated mind; yet upon the whole we mu&s;t deem him as un&s;ea&s;oned a hero as ever gave name to a dramatic piece; &s;ome interviews with his mother are, in re&s;pect of the une&s;&s;ential &s;ecrecy pre&s;erved, ridiculous; and throughout the piece, he &s;eems too much an en|gine of the plot.&mdash;Mr. POWELL's plea&s;ing appear|ance and &s;uitable powers rai&s;ed the prince far above that degree of mediocrity, in which the author has placed him; had there been more favourable opportunities for execution, we are per&s;uaded, it would not have been wanting; but reaching even the languid term of prai&s;e, agreeable, was as much as any performer could hope to arrive at.</P>
<P>Mr. WROUGHTON has of late been mo&s;t cruelly obtruded on the public in this part; cruelly for him&s;elf and the audience, &s;ince even tho&s;e who force him to the undertaking mu&s;t admit, that his abilities are as much beneath even the languid Cy|rus, as Mr. POWELL's were beyond him; but it &s;eems to be a received managerical maxim at pre|&s;ent, to give the public neck-beef where they have a right to expect veni&s;on; no very grateful return for that amazing encouragement which is afforded.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="250">Harpagus appears to be a &s;tate&s;man of com|mendable principles; he feels ju&s;t re&s;entment for the murder of a &s;on, yet &s;uppre&s;&s;es his revenge till a regular train of events comes to place Cyrus on his grandfather's throne; his di&s;&s;imulation with A&s;tyages is very defen&s;ible, and his character equal throughout; his death is not quite con|&s;i&s;tent with poetical ju&s;tice, but nece&s;&s;ary; Mr. HULL, though better calculated for exhibiting amiable and tender feelings, than any which bor|der upon gloomy and &s;anguinary de&s;igns, repre&s;ents Harpagus with merit at lea&s;t equal to any other male character in the piece.</P>
<P>Mithranes's loyal and parental attachment to Cyrus; his anxious concern for the prince's &s;afety, and the evident pains he has taken to in&s;til princi|ples worthy that elevated &s;tation his royal pupil &s;eems de&s;igned for, render him highly e&s;timable; he is thrown into very intere&s;ting &s;ituations, and has a manife&s;t advantage over every other cha|racter, except Mandane; it would be inju&s;tice not to allow Mr. BENSLEY con&s;iderable prai&s;e in the performance of this part; yet, we apprehend, the play would have been much better ca&s;t at fir&s;t, if Mr. POWELL had done Mithranes, Mr. SMITH Cyrus, and Mr. BENSLEY Camby&s;es; it &s;hould at pre&s;ent undoubtedly &s;tand thus; Mr. SMITH Cyrus, Mr. BENSLEY Camby&s;es, and Mr. HULL Mithranes&mdash;though, by the bye, &s;o rich is Co|vent-garden in merit, we know not an apology for Harpagus, to &s;upply &s;uch a change, except Mr. GIBSON, who might much more rea&s;onably be

<P>Con&s;cious of Mrs. YATES's very forceable ex|pre&s;&s;ion, the author has endeavoured, and not unhappily, to furni&s;h her &s;everal opportunities of di&s;playing capital talents; through every change of tenderne&s;s, rage, fear, affection and di&s;traction, &s;he &s;hews powers which mu&s;t work &s;trong and na|tural feelings upon the audience; tears, apprehen|&s;ions, and even a degree of a&s;toni&s;hment wait on her Mandane; judicious tran&s;itions of voice, hap|py variations of countenance, and picture&s;que atti|tudes unite to make this the mo&s;t fini&s;hed piece of female action we remember to have &s;een, except Mrs. CIBBER's Alicia and Con&s;tance; indeed it is &s;o much beyond what we behold at pre&s;ent in general, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing to hear people &s;ay, in&s;tead of <Q REND="inline">"We are going to &s;ee Cyrus,"</Q> We are going to &s;ee Mrs. YATES.</P>

<P>The plot of Cyrus is in many places wrought up with plea&s;ing perplexity, but falls into a patched-up cata&s;trophe; the fir&s;t, &s;econd and fifth acts are lan|guid; the third and fourth &s;triking and &s;pirited; the

<HEAD>THE CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE. A Comedy. By Me&s;&s;. GARRICK and COLMAN.</HEAD>
<P>WE have either ob&s;erved, or meant to ob&s;erve, that &s;pirit and propriety of character, vivacity of dialogue, wit, and variety of incidents, are the con&s;tituent parts of a good comedy; many of late have got into the &s;tile of mere &s;entiment, and chit-chat picked up from novels, which they are vain and idle enough to &s;uppo&s;e compleat dramas; if &s;uch authors are right, Ben John&s;on, Wycherley, Congreve, Farquhar and Cibber, were undoub|tedly wrong; licenciou&s;ne&s;s, 'tis true, has di&s;ap|peared, but in general it &s;eems as if wit and plea|&s;antry, who were too long united with &s;o bad a companion, had followed their old ally; how far the child of poetical partner&s;hip now before us has fallen into or avoided the fa&s;hionable languor let candid con&s;ideration declare.</P>
<P>Fanny, merchant Sterling's younge&s;t daughter, is acquainted by the maid Betty, at the opening of the play, that her hu&s;band is ju&s;t come from Lon|don; as Fanny is fearful that any hint of her &s;ecret match with Lovewell &s;hould e&s;cape, &s;he &s;trives to check, but with little effect, the maid's bab|bling impatience, who&s;e frequent mention of what &s;he is de&s;ired to be &s;o cautious of, &s;prinkles the &s;cene with laughter; but we apprehend, however natural in private, the pregnant &s;tate of Fanny

<P>The merchant charges Lovewell with following his daughter, and upon the young man's mention of him&s;elf as a hu&s;band for her, Sterling, citizen-like, hints a deficiency in pecuniary qualification; Lovewell's arguments of per&s;ua&s;ion are all an|&s;wered and defeated, by his not having the recom|mendatory <HI>&s;tuff</HI>; Sterling's peculiarity through this &s;cene is entertainingly expre&s;&s;ed, and the confu&s;ion that Lovewell is thrown into by urging him to a promi&s;e of mentioning the matter no more, is very natural; his e&s;cape from the dilemma is al&s;o well conceived in promi&s;ing that things &s;hall go no far|ther.</P>
<P>On being informed of lord Ogleby's &s;peedy ap|proach, after &s;ome humorous remarks on the peer's letter, Sterling breaks out with pur&s;e-proud &s;ufficiency re&s;pecting his own ta&s;te and ability for entertaining per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank; ignorant o&s;tentation is here &s;hewn in glaring colours, and the whole &s;cene is agreeably &s;u&s;tained; the &s;oliloquy

<P>Lord Ogleby and his Swi&s;s confidant appear next conferring upon the circum&s;tance of Fanny's being &s;ent to town, which occa&s;ions his lord&s;hip to make &s;ome humorous remarks upon all the family but her, whom, as it appears, he thinks more than tolerable, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he has a tender for him; Canton's adulation and the peer's laughable vanity are mo&s;t humorou&s;ly di&s;played.</P>
<P>The following &s;cene between Lovewell and his wife con&s;i&s;ts of a propo&s;ition from him to make lord Ogleby acquainted with their marriage, as the mo&s;t probable method of removing their perplexi|ty; his lord&s;hip appears, and the lady is left by her hu&s;band to open the affair.&mdash;For &s;ome time their conver&s;ation is all preparatory for the main point, and the amorous nobleman, from the lady's very natural confu&s;ion, draws &s;ome favourable conclu|&s;ions concerning his influence upon her; the expre&s;|&s;ions he throws out a&s;ide &s;hew a rich vien of hu|mour; the mention of Sir John's addre&s;&s;es occa|&s;ions a plea&s;ing mi&s;con&s;truction, as Ogleby's folly cau&s;es him to think that the lady's di&s;like proceeds from an attachment to him.&mdash;Canton's interruptive entrance is very well conceived to divide the &s;cene,
<PB N="247" REF="261">
which, we deem, to be highly and uniformly fi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip's &s;oliloquy al&s;o is worthy of what precedes it.&mdash;In his conference with Sterling and Mi&s;s, the mi&s;con&s;truction is made excellent u&s;e of on both &s;ides; particularly as appearances deceive one party, while vanity mi&s;leads the other from real truth; lord Ogleby's manner of opening his de&s;ign of marrying Fanny to her father is executed with great judgement; and the following &s;cene with Lovewell is a mo&s;t intere&s;ting continuation of that mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, which furni&s;hes &s;uch entertaining materials to this act.</P>
<P>There is a very artful and regular climax of hu|mour, which ri&s;es with every fre&s;h character, and keeps the peer, for an u&s;ual length of dialogue, &s;o far from palling that even at the end of the act, we wi&s;h for more of him; his triumph over Sir John's preten&s;ions to Fanny gives a mo&s;t agreeable variation of plea&s;antry, and we are doubtful if any dramatic character was ever better &s;upported &s;o long together.</P>
<P>The fifth act begins with Lovewell and Fanny at the cri&s;is of their anxiety, dreading a di&s;covery, which neverthele&s;s it now appears ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to make; by Mrs. Betty we are informed, with her u&s;ual circumlocution, that they are in dan|ger from &s;ome eaves-droppers; her taking miff is very &s;uitable to one whom confidence makes pert.</P>
<P>Fanny, upon returning from a look-out, reque&s;ts Lovewell to retire, which he obligingly complies with; Mi&s;s Sterling, full of envious jealou&s;y and
<PB N="248" REF="262">
&s;u&s;picion, begins the next &s;cene with her aunt, on who&s;e affectionate feelings &s;he works by an artful appearance of violent grief; it appears, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;es Sir John Melville to be in Fanny's cham|ber, lodged there with a de&s;ign of running away with her next morning; the approach of Bru&s;h drives off the&s;e two ladies.</P>
<P>This gallant valet, elevated with liquor, pays addre&s;&s;es to the chambermaid, and &s;peaking of the wine he has been drinking, throws out coxcomi|cally this &s;troke of well-conceived &s;atire,
<Q REND="inline">"I am a little electrified, that's the truth on't; I am not u&s;ed to drink port, and your ma&s;ter's is &s;o heady, that a pint of it over&s;ets a claret-drinker."</Q>
&mdash;His clo&s;e attack upon the girl, and her apprehen&s;ion of being detected, occa&s;ion &s;ome mention of Mi&s;s Sterling, of whom Mr. Bru&s;h expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf rather freely, and in her hearing, as &s;he happens to be upon the li&s;ten; this, and his declaring an in|tention of entering Mrs. Heildelberg's apartment, if the chambermaid re&s;i&s;ts, bring that old lady and Mi&s;s Sterling forward, brimful of rage and re|proaches; Bru&s;h however &s;campers off, and leaves his &s;weetheart to encounter them; &s;uppo&s;ing her in Fanny's plot, they brow-beat &s;everely, and examine her &s;trictly; however being totally ignorant of the matter, they only put her into an unavailing fright.</P>
<P>Mrs. Heidelberg goes off to rectify her head|dre&s;s, and leaves Mi&s;s Sterling on the watch, who &s;eeing Betty come out of her &s;i&s;ter's room, taxes her with having material &s;ecrets in her cu&s;tody; Mr. Sterling and Mrs. Heidelberg enter at this point of

time, the fir&s;t enquiring why he is di&s;turbed, and the la&s;t acquainting him with the &s;uppo&s;ed villainy of Sir John Melville's being in Fanny's bed-cham|ber: this alarms the father, who is not willing, however, to have it made a public matter, by a|waking lord Ogleby and the whole family.</P>
<P>The citizen's de&s;ign of making Sir John marry his younge&s;t daughter privately in the morning, throws the elde&s;t into &s;o violent an agitation of &s;pi|rits, that &s;he and her aunt break out, in &s;pite of his interpo&s;ition; their cries bring forth Canton and his lord&s;hip, the lawyers, &amp;c. in very laughable appearances.</P>
<P>The ladies take great pains, on his lord&s;hip's cordial enquiry after Fanny's &s;afety, to per&s;uade him that &s;he is on the point of running away with his nephew Sir John; however the peer's opinion of her being attached inviolably to him bars all the pa&s;|&s;ages of belief: his confidence even interferes &s;o far as to call Fanny out of the chamber; ju&s;t as he mentions his nephew as the concealed party, Sir John comes on at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, which invali|dates a main part of the charge.&mdash;Nothing can be more &s;uitable than the lawyers making their remarks in terms of practice.</P>
<P>Betty now opens the door, and lets out her mi|&s;tre&s;s in a great flutter of &s;pirits, which operates &s;o &s;trongly as to occa&s;ion her fainting; this incident draws Lovewell from his retreat, who, in the warmth of anxiety, avows his regard for her, and after &s;ome altercation, the marriage is declared: this &s;trikes all with a&s;toni&s;hment, and cau&s;es Ster|ling

<P>The language of this piece is &s;pirited, and in ge|neral cha&s;te, though not elegant; the &s;entiments ju&s;t without brilliance, the incidents well ranged, the plot plea&s;ingly unfolded, judiciou&s;ly conducted, and well wrought up to the cata&s;trophe; as to wit, it traces natural conver&s;ation of the pre&s;ent day &s;o clo&s;e, as not to have a &s;park throughout the five acts; and for moral, it has not the &s;hadow of one, which the authors &s;eemed con&s;cious of, when, in|&s;tead of adverting to &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point, they a|dopted the pitiful, though cla&s;&s;ical, mode of conclu|&s;ion by begging applau&s;e from the audience; which is a little like Merry-Andrew's bidding <HI>his</HI> audience &s;hout, when he has played tricks before them: in an epilogue, &s;uch a &s;ugar-&s;op may be dropped to &s;weeten the acidity of critical opinion; but at the end of a play, it mu&s;t certainly be deemed a piece of poetical &s;ycophanti&s;m.</P>
<P>Lord Ogleby, though pronounced a very near re|lation of lord Chalk&s;tone, is mo&s;t certainly as much an original, and as much a child of laughter, as any character on the &s;tage&mdash;harmle&s;sly vain, plea|&s;antly odd, commendably generous; a coxcomb not void of &s;en&s;e, a ma&s;ter full of whim, a lover

full of fal&s;e fire, yet a valuable friend; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of delicate feelings and nice honour: the peculiarities of this difficult part are &s;upported with eminent abili|ties by that mo&s;t excellent comedian Mr. KING, who notwith&s;tanding his chief prai&s;e derives from being a cha&s;te delineator of nature, here &s;trikes out in the water colour painting of life, a mo&s;t beautiful and &s;triking caricature, conceived with &s;ome degree of poetical extravagance, yet &s;o meliorated by his execution, that thou&s;ands who have never &s;een &s;uch a human being as Lord Ogleby, mu&s;t, amid&s;t invo|luntary bur&s;ts of laughter, allow, nay wi&s;h there may be &s;uch a man, who&s;e foibles are &s;o inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>If Mr. KING &s;hews more merit in any one pa&s;|&s;age than another, it is where Sterling &s;ays to the young couple <Q REND="inline">"Lovewell, you &s;hall leave my hou&s;e; and, madam, you &s;hall follow him;"</Q> to which the peer with infinite good nature replies, <Q REND="inline">"and if they do, I &s;hall receive them into mine."</Q>&mdash;Though it does not always follow that what an actor feels mo&s;t he can expre&s;s be&s;t; yet we may venture to &s;ay a kind of &s;ympathetic uni&s;on gives this &s;hort &s;entence pecu|liar force and beauty in Mr. KING's utterance.</P>
<P>Sir John Melville is chief confu&s;ion-maker of the piece, of indifferent principles and in&s;ipid qualificati|ons; ea&s;e and gentility of deporment, which are the only requi&s;ites nece&s;&s;ary for this gentleman, were equally wanting in the late Mr. HOLLAND, and the pre&s;ent Mr. AICKIN: however, tolerable propriety is as much as this water-gruel baronet de&s;erves, and &s;o far he received no injury from the&s;e gentlemen.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="266">Sterling is a well drawn uniform character, mount|ed upon the &s;tilts of property, aiming at and boa&s;t|ing of ta&s;te he has not: grappling at pelf of which he has a &s;uperfluity; &s;elfi&s;h and po&s;itive, where he dare excerci&s;e authority; o&s;tentatious, methodical and ig|norant; thus compounded he gives con&s;iderable life to tho&s;e &s;cenes where he is concerned, when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mr. YATES's inimitable talents for &s;uch cha|racters; but in the hands of Mr. LOVE &s;inks beneath critici&s;m, and &s;eems only calculated to lull attention to &s;leep; it is a great pity this monotonous gentle|man ro&s;e any higher than Serjeant Flower; the florid unvarying importance of phy&s;iognomy he com|monly wears, being better adapted to a lumber headed lawyer, than any other character.</P>
<P>Lovewell engages an audience by his tender &s;enti|ments, and affectionate &s;incerity; his &s;ituation affects, and his manners plea&s;e us; Mr. POWELL never made a more agreeable figure in comedy, nor per|haps &s;o good a one as in this part, which being placed in a &s;tation of life that he him&s;elf had filled not long before; and being happily &s;uited not only to his ex|ternal appearance, but his internal feelings al&s;o, he &s;atisfied mo&s;t agreeably every point of expectation; even Mr. CAUTHERLY, though far beneath the original, is not an in&s;ufferable Lovewell.</P>
<P>The lawyers are drawn in a ma&s;terly manner, and for the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned above, we think Mr. LOVE had merit in the Serjeant&mdash;would he had never been removed; however, it mu&s;t be allowed that Mr. BRANSBY is a worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or, as he &s;upports at lea&s;t the <HI>weight</HI> of the character with equal merit.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="267">Canton is an admirable delineation of a foreign &s;ycophant playing upon a vain Engli&s;h nobleman; the picture is in&s;tructive, and held to view in a very ju&s;t advantageous point of light by Mr. BADDELEY, who breaks expre&s;&s;ion well into the Swi&s;s Dialect, and cringes through the part in a very characteri&s;tic manner.</P>
<P>Bru&s;h is an excellent contra&s;t of the a&s;&s;uming Engli&s;h valet, and while in view, claims &s;ome notice &mdash;the late Mr. PALMER de&s;erved and met more ap|plau&s;e than could be expected to attend &s;o &s;hort a character, where tip&s;ey he was highly laughable; his &s;ucce&s;&s;or and name-&s;ake if not quite &s;o plea&s;ant; has neverthele&s;s a con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit.</P>

<P>She is left at the cata&s;trophe in a mo&s;t unde|termined, and we may add, notwith&s;tanding her foi|bles, an un&s;atisfactory &s;tate; the authors have made &s;omething of her at fir&s;t, to drop her into nothing at la&s;t; in this view, &s;he mu&s;t rather be a dead weight upon any performer; however, Mi&s;s POPE, &s;urmounting di&s;advantages, renders the young lady rather more than tolerable.</P>
<P>Fanny has a manife&s;t advantage of her &s;i&s;ter in &s;implicity of manners, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of affec|tion, and delicacy of feeling; her &s;ituation al&s;o happily enforces the amiable parts of her character; Mrs. PALMER, the original in this part, &s;poke more both to the head and heart, than Mrs. BAD|DELY either does or can do; &s;ome lucky hits, with a more plea&s;ing figure, make her pa&s;s off upon general opinion as well as her predece&s;&s;or, but where critici&s;m interferes, we mu&s;t think much more favourably of the pa&s;t than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Betty will never again be performed with merit equal to the lady, who with much ju&s;tice declined the in&s;ertion of her name in the drama for &s;o in|&s;ignificant a character; a character far below her capabilities, almo&s;t as far as it is above Mrs. LOVE's execution, of whom it was literrally cruel to make an actre&s;s&mdash;yet by &s;ome unaccountable fa|tality,

this unhappy lady is &s;hoved on for many things, which would have been much better in other hands, and could not be wor&s;e in any.&mdash;Why, why will managers &s;o far mi&s;take the judgment of an audience, as to venture the intru&s;ion of &s;uch creatures as under&s;tand little, and expre&s;s le&s;s.</P>
<P>The chambermaid, according to what is &s;aid of her, was as well figured and played as ever &s;he will be, by Mi&s;s PLYMM.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of the piece in a complicate view, it certainly has a great deal of acting merit&mdash;a tho|rough knowledge of life and character is e&s;&s;ential to draw comic &s;cenes &s;ucce&s;sfully; of this the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE is a plea&s;ing proof; however, &s;ome of the &s;cenes are heavy, and a few trifling; the dialogue is not &s;o &s;pirited and ea&s;y as Farquhar's, nor &s;o luxuriant and nervous as Con|greve's, yet agreeably di&s;engaged; the &s;atire well pointed, and the &s;entiments lively, though not ge|nerally in&s;tructive: if &s;tanding the te&s;t of clo&s;et critici&s;m be the faire&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;timable degree of merit, we mu&s;t not venture to place this piece a|mong the foremo&s;t; but in repre&s;entation, we are willing to allow it every point of approbation, which the indulgent public has favoured it with, and much more than many others can claim, which po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e very requi&s;ites the CLANDESTINE MARRIAGE wants.</P>

<HEAD>THE FAIR PENITENT. A TRAGEDY by Mr. ROWE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS dramatic compo&s;ition was wrote at a time when genius received nouri&s;hment from the beams of royal favour, ere the mu&s;es of this i&s;le were germanized into &s;tone; and &s;tands to this day in e&s;timation at lea&s;t equal to any except tho&s;e of Shake&s;peare. It opens with Horatio and Alta|mont, two per&s;ons of rank in Genoa, from whom we learn, that it is the latter's bridal day; there appears to be &s;trong links of friend&s;hip between the&s;e two characters, and that Sciolto, a nobleman, father to Altamont's bride, has &s;hewn particular marks of favour to Horatio, on account of being Altamont's brother-in-law and friend; his attach|ment to Altamont aro&s;e from a peculiar mark of filial duty &s;hewn by him to a dead father, in yield|ing him&s;elf to pri&s;on, that his father's corp&s;e, which had been arre&s;ted by rigid creditors, might obtain the u&s;ual rites of burial.</P>

<P>Lothario, a young lord of di&s;&s;olute principles, with his confidante Ro&s;&s;ano, appear next; from the expre&s;&s;ions at fir&s;t dropped by Lothario we find, there is a rooted enmity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and Sciolto's connections, chiefly on account of Cali&s;ta, of who&s;e unfortunate credulity, and his own triumph over her virtue, he gives a mo&s;t fan|ciful, but highly cen&s;urable de&s;cription; vice is here adorned with irre&s;i&s;table charms to an un|guarded mind, and therefore pre&s;ented to public view in her mo&s;t dangerous garb: rea&s;on and judg|ment commi&s;erating the betrayed, mu&s;t condemn the betrayer; yet we fear the luxuriance of fancy here works a quite contrary effect; le&s;s merit in the writing would have le&s;&s;ened the danger, either in peru&s;al or repre&s;entation; gro&s;s licentiou&s;ne&s;s di&s;gu&s;ts, but the refined &s;ort, like palatable poi&s;on, introduces de&s;truction unperceived.</P>
<P>Lucilla appears on me&s;&s;age from her mi&s;tre&s;s Cali&s;ta, and addre&s;&s;es the gay deceiver in pathetic terms; his replies are much in character, and the &s;cene has con&s;iderable &s;pirit in action; but we doubt whether delicacy and ju&s;t re&s;erve are not too violently offended by the maid's proclaiming her mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ituation before a third per&s;on: Horatio's unexpected approach &s;hortens their conference, and in the hurry of retiring, Lothario drops the letter ju&s;t received from Cali&s;ta by her maid.&mdash;This the friend of Altamont takes up, and though good

<P>Lavinia at her entrance makes a very natural en|quiry, why Horatio has left even the marriage ce|remony; for this no apology is offered, as we do not perceive a rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect Cali&s;ta before di&s;|covery of the letter ju&s;t found, nor any other cau&s;e for ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the immediate celebra|tion of his friend's nuptials; the re&s;olution of not acquainting Altamont with the dreadful di&s;covery is tender, generous, &s;en&s;ible and friendly.&mdash;La|vinia's concern at her hu&s;band's confu&s;ed, unin|telligible behaviour is prettily expre&s;&s;ed, but we conceive an exception again&s;t the following pa&s;&s;age; in the mid&s;t of &s;ympathetic anxiety, which naturally &s;peaks to the point at once, &s;he utters the following &s;uperfluous &s;imile;

<P>Cali&s;ta, &s;welled with perturbed agitation of mind, begins the &s;econd act with refu&s;al of comfort from Lucilla, who offers, but in vain, &s;ome cordial &s;en|&s;ible advice; the wretched bride, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a|gain&s;t her new hu&s;band, indulges the mo&s;t gloomy ideas and expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;content; her de&s;cription of what &s;he &s;hould deem an eligible ab&s;traction from the world, is extremely picture&s;que, but too poetical; it breathes the air of romantic, rather than natural grief; the pride of heart, which had not power to check fatal delu&s;ion and the lo&s;s of virtue, yet &s;oars above worldly cen&s;ure, and urges her to entertain thoughts of death, rather than public &s;hame; this, we believe, has been too often the ca&s;e in reality, and is therefore a commendable picture held up to &s;tartle young minds from &s;imilar indi&s;cretion; infatuation is admirably depicted in her re&s;olution to &s;ee Lothario, though it forbids any

claim to the character of Penitent, and &s;hews it is not &s;o much a &s;en&s;e of guilt, as an impatience of being cro&s;&s;ed in her wi&s;hes, that agitates her.&mdash;This is no doubt natural, but renders her much le&s;s an object of pity than real contrition would have done; female weakne&s;s, influenced by ill-grounded love, is finely and in&s;tructively de&s;cribed in this &s;cene.</P>
<P>Upon Altamont's approach, Cali&s;ta forms the re&s;olution of guarding her real thoughts from di&s;|covery; the amorous bridegroom addre&s;&s;es her in terms of rapture, to which &s;he makes a cold and dubious return; and even goes &s;o far as to tell him their union is not founded on the principles of hap|pine&s;s; Sciolto, replete with parental joy, gives di|rections for every mark of fe&s;tivity, and pronoun|cing an emphatic nuptial benediction, retires with all the characters, except Horatio, who in &s;oliloquy canva&s;&s;es again the &s;ubject which &s;its &s;o heavy on his heart; he &s;uppo&s;es and wi&s;hes the letter to be forged, but &s;eems to draw very unfavourable con|clu&s;ions from Cali&s;ta's confu&s;ed and gloomy de|portment; this occa&s;ions him to throw out a ge|neral, and therefore illiberal reflection again&s;t the whole &s;ex, adverting to the &s;trained &s;imilitude of original &s;in in Eve.</P>

<P><PB N="261" REF="275">Horatio here enters, as it appears, in &s;earch of Lothario; their encounter is natural, and their di&s;|pute is wrought up not only by ju&s;t degrees, but in terms &s;uitable to the dignity of tho&s;e who are di&s;putants; the cool determination of Altamont's friend, is beautifully contra&s;ted to the petu|lant, o&s;tentatious impatience of his antagoni&s;t; the one rea&s;ons like a man of &s;en&s;e and virtue, the other prevaricates like an unprincipled cox|comb; when the charge of forgery is brought home, which Lothario only an&s;wers in the doubt|ful &s;tile, Horatio utters a mo&s;t beautiful &s;arca&s;m again&s;t him and all other pernicious reptiles of his depraved nature, which we cannot avoid quot|ing;

<L>As the <HI>fond</HI> tales which you recount of love.</L></Q></P>
<P>The word <HI>fond</HI> in the la&s;t line is not of very ob|vious meaning, unle&s;s to tho&s;e who know, that in York&s;hire and &s;ome other parts of England, it im|plies &s;illy; even in this &s;en&s;e, we think, either the epithet of <HI>foul</HI> or <HI>ba&s;e</HI> tales would have &s;uited pre|meditate &s;candal much better.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of this altercation, Horatio &s;hews him&s;elf not only a man of real courage, but al&s;o the active, warm friend; nor does Lothario fall
<PB N="262" REF="276">
&s;hort of commendable &s;pirit, if exerted in a better cau&s;e; we think the &s;trength of Horatio's feelings rather hurry him to indi&s;cretion, when he mentions the matter before a third per&s;on; the challenge is well given, though we di&s;approve Lothario's gro&s;s reflection which provokes a blow from his antago|ni&s;t; there is much dignity and cool determination in Horatio's brief acceptation of the &s;ummons: The conclu&s;ive &s;peech of this act, which conveys in &s;ome very beautiful lines excellent in&s;truction to the fair &s;ex, is, we apprehend, exceptionable; not only from being run &s;o much into rhime, but be|cau&s;e it nece&s;&s;itates the &s;peaker to &s;tep out of cha|racter, and addre&s;s the audience, a circum&s;tance by no means defen&s;ible.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act it appears, that Sciolto has di&s;covered his daughter's &s;ullen beha|viour, and reproves it in terms of high di&s;plea&s;ure; the &s;imile which clo&s;es his fir&s;t &s;peech is &s;trained, and, like mo&s;t others in dramatic compo&s;ition, &s;u|perfluous; his threats are of a very &s;erious nature, and occa&s;ion Cali&s;ta to make &s;ome remarks upon the &s;ubordinate &s;tate of her &s;ex, which her proud heart &s;eems ill calculated to brook; Horatio ap|proaches, and intimates how critical the &s;ubject he comes upon is, therefore re&s;olves to enter upon it in the gentle&s;t manner; whatever ju&s;tice may ap|pear in his de&s;ign, we agree with Cali&s;ta, that &s;teal|ing upon her is a breach of decorum incon&s;i&s;tent with per&s;ons of rank.</P>
<P>Cali&s;ta's di&s;like of Altamont is a very &s;ufficient rea&s;on why &s;he &s;hould hold his mo&s;t intimate friend
<PB N="263" REF="277">
at di&s;tance; her in&s;inuation of this brings on the point in view; upon Horatio's delivering that ex|cellent &s;entiment, <Q REND="inline">"To be good is to be happy,"</Q> and mentioning that <Q REND="inline">"Guilt is the &s;ource of &s;or|row,"</Q> the author has &s;hewn him&s;elf well acquaint|ed with con&s;cious feelings by making the lady kin|dle at the word guilt; it being certain, that tho&s;e who have done ill are mo&s;t ready to catch at the im|putation of it; Horatio &s;eizes this opportunity to pre&s;s the matter clo&s;er, which only &s;erving more to inflame Cali&s;ta's rage, he, at length, as a proof of his a&s;&s;ertion &s;hews her the letter to Lothario; una|ble to re&s;i&s;t &s;o palpable a conviction, &s;he tries a very natural effort of female policy, which is by tearing the letter, to di&s;arm him at lea&s;t of po|&s;itive proof.</P>
<P>At this critical cri&s;is, while &s;he is &s;welled with rage, and his friend covered with confu&s;ion, Altamont comes forward, with fre&s;h declarations of love, but takes a natural alarm at &s;eeing his bride and Hora|tio in &s;uch a &s;ituation; Cali&s;ta here, by throwing inflammatory materials on the mind of her hu&s;|band, and urging a quarrel of fatal nature between the friends, &s;hews her&s;elf highly capable of plung|ing into one degree of iniquity to &s;creen another, and that even a &s;acrifice of blood is not too much for her ill-founded pride; this we allow to be &s;trict|ly in nature, but the grounds of an execrable cha|racter; at her departure &s;he rages in &s;ome very poetical rhimes.</P>
<P>The following &s;cene between the friends takes a turn which may be expected; the prejudiced bride|groom,
<PB N="264" REF="278">
who thinks the object of his wi&s;hes free from every criminal imputation, charges Horatio with ill behaviour, who to exculpate him&s;elf is be|trayed into an explanation re&s;pecting Cali&s;ta, rather blameable; yet from a per&s;on in his agitation of &s;pi|rits probable enough. Fired by the charge of guilt, levelled at her he loves, a charge merely &s;upported by a&s;&s;ertion; Altamont indulges violent re&s;entment, even &s;o far as to throw off all traces of friend&s;hip; we have another blow given in this &s;cene; as &s;uch a cir|cum&s;tance generally creates laughter, and is at any rate di&s;graceful to per&s;ons of rank, we wonder an author of Mr. ROWE's delicacy, could repeatedly introduce it.</P>
<P>Horatio's reluctance to endanger the life even of an ungrateful friend, and adverting to a likene&s;s of his father, are proofs of a great and tender mind, which urged beyond all bearing, at length acts on the e&s;|&s;ential principle of &s;elf defence. Lavinia's &s;ea&s;onable interpo&s;ition prevents fatal con&s;equences, yet cannot &s;prinkle any drops of patience on Altamont's inflam|ed heart; who behaves with almo&s;t as much bru|tal roughne&s;s to her as he has done with &s;avage fury to his friend; in &s;hort we mu&s;t deem Altamont, through this whole &s;cene, both a fool and a mad|man; had Horatio been drawn with as little &s;en&s;e and tenderne&s;s, poor well-meaning Lavinia mu&s;t have brought her&s;elf into a mo&s;t painful &s;ituation; however, the manly tenderne&s;s of her hu&s;band balms in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;tings a brother's unkindne&s;s has planted in her heart, and &s;he returns it properly by an affectionate declaration of attachment, in the la&s;t &s;peech of the act, where, however, plea&s;ing
<PB N="265" REF="279">
&s;entiments and nature are again injured by &s;imile and rhime; though had the latter been avoided, the former might have pa&s;&s;ed without objection, nay perhaps with &s;ome degree of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;oliloquy begins the fourth act, wherein Al|tamont &s;eems to &s;tand &s;elf-convicted of folly in quar|relling with his friend for a woman, who repays his raptures with coldne&s;s and di&s;dain; upon his exit Lothario and Cali&s;ta appear; the gay gallant en|deavouring to &s;ooth his deceived and enraged mi&s;|tre&s;s, who &s;hews a ju&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t the fal&s;e|hood which has plunged her into mi&s;ery; his up|braiding her with having married the man he hates, is an artful &s;troke of exculpation relative to him&s;elf, and &s;timulates her rage con&s;iderably: Altamont's appearance at this period is well contrived, and what Cali&s;ta &s;ays previous to his coming in view brings him forward in a &s;triking manner; Lotha|rio's fate is properly precipitated; his dying words &s;uit the tenor of his pa&s;t conduct, and he expires in the &s;ame character he has maintained through life.</P>
<P>Cali&s;ta's de&s;peration at his fall, and the irre&s;i&s;ta|ble proof of her own guilt, is a natural effect of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions; Altamont's immediate confe&s;&s;ion of forgivene&s;s, &s;hews him to have at lea&s;t as much weakne&s;s as humanity; the voice of Sciolto heard from without, &s;trikes his daughter with a fre&s;h de|gree of confu&s;ion; upon the old man's entrance, the traces of blood alarm &s;u&s;picion in him, which being confirmed by what Altamont replies, his fu|ry
<PB N="266" REF="280">
breaking all ties of paternal tenderne&s;s aims at Cali&s;ta's life, which is &s;aved by her hu&s;band's hu|mane interpo&s;ition, even contrary to her &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ive &s;upplications for death at a father's hand; Sciolto's &s;tart of phrenzy being pa&s;&s;ed off, he in|dulges reflection and reproach in a truly pathetic manner; the picture Cali&s;ta gives of her own re|tirement, contrition, and mournful cata&s;trophe is extremely affecting.</P>
<P>After &s;he di&s;appears, we are &s;truck with the idea of &s;ome fatal re&s;olution, and melted with the old man's tears; who, on hearing that Lothario's facti|on are a&s;&s;embled threatening ruin, &s;eems plea&s;ed with an opportunity of carrying vengeance even among the friends of that young lord; after a &s;oliloquy of Altamont's, which indeed means very little, La|vinia enters in confu&s;ion, and lets us know, that &s;he has ju&s;t been re&s;cued from a mob, with whom her hu&s;band is &s;till engaged at hazard of his life.</P>
<P>Horatio &s;oon enters to di&s;&s;ipate her apprehen|&s;ions; but treats Altamont with that ju&s;t and firm contempt his behaviour in the former act merited; the &s;i&s;ter pleads amiably for her brother, and the unhappy man makes very tender conce&s;&s;ions.&mdash; Horatio, we think, highly blameable, for &s;o gro&s;s a reflection as <Q REND="inline">"an infamous, believing Briti&s;h hu&s;|band:"</Q> to taunt him with &s;o cutting a misfortune is inhuman; and the &s;tigma of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> hu&s;bands, though perhaps proverbial among&s;t the Italians, is very illiberal; too much &s;o to be adopted; Alta|mont is far too figurative in the &s;peech which
<PB N="267" REF="281">
begins, <Q REND="inline">"I have wronged thee much,"</Q> and Lavi|nia's carrying on the allu&s;ion with which it con|cludes, is an unpardonable tre&s;pa&s;s upon &s;erious feelings.</P>
<P>Altamont's tears touch Horatio with &s;ympathy, and it is to be wi&s;hed, that they alone had wrought the de&s;irable effect of tenderne&s;s; as the panto|mimical &s;troke of falling down is utterly contempti|ble; and the two &s;peeches occa&s;ioned by it, rather laughable: this whole &s;cene is very inadequate to the re&s;t of the play, and the characters are carried off with a jingling tag &s;poken by Lavinia, which has more &s;ound than meaning.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding good language, &s;triking cha|racters, and a well conducted plot may di&s;dain the adventitious a&s;&s;i&s;tance of proce&s;&s;ions, rooms hung with black, &amp;c. we cannot help allowing that this latter decoration, with Lothario's body in view, gives a nece&s;&s;ary &s;olemnity to the fifth act, which Cali&s;ta opens with a &s;oliloquy of mo&s;t ma&s;terly compo&s;ition; Sciolto's appearance at &s;uch a time of night, in &s;uch a place, and what he &s;ays, prepare us for a &s;cene peculiarly intere&s;ting; nor are our warme&s;t expectations deceived in the progre&s;s of it; the father and daughter now lulled from the turbu|lence of pa&s;&s;ion, mutually un&s;luice their hearts, and, if the phra&s;e is allowable, let flow a &s;pring-tide of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Here, in &s;pite of guilt, we mu&s;t feel for the un|happy fair one, and &s;ympathize with the hoary wretched fire. Who &s;ees him lift up the dagger
<PB N="268" REF="282">
with unre&s;olved and trembling hand, but &s;hudders? who hears his di&s;traction at the thoughts of his daughter's ta&s;ting death, but feels pity vibrating in every nerve? however, recommending &s;elf-de&s;truc|tion to his child, is equally unworthy the Chri&s;tian, the parent, and the man.</P>
<P>Returning to the plea&s;ure her infant years gave him, and his forgivene&s;s of her, are circum&s;tances thoroughly pathetic; his parting carries the climax of tenderne&s;s as high as it can well go; the &s;ucceed|ing &s;cene between Altamont and Cali&s;ta is extreme|ly languid, and &s;eems to have little el&s;e in view, than giving a fre&s;h in&s;tance of that amorous weak|ne&s;s which &s;o entirely rules the injured hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Horatio comes with the melancholy information of Sciolto's being mortally wounded; which hurries Cali&s;ta into the tremendous act of &s;uicide; an ex|ample Altamont &s;eems inclined to follow, but for the prevention of his friend; Cali&s;ta lives to re|ceive the ble&s;&s;ing of her expiring father, which is extended al&s;o to Horatio and his &s;on; Cali&s;ta makes &s;ome attonement to her hu&s;band with her la&s;t breath; Altamont declares an indifference for life, and Ho|ratio concludes the piece by rhiming forth an evi|dent and very excellent moral.</P>
<P>The title of this tragedy has by many critics been deemed a mi&s;nomer; for, &s;ay they, the lady's be|haviour in no &s;hape entitles her to the character of a Penitent; this charge we cannot wholly admit, though we mu&s;t in general; in &s;everal places &s;he &s;peaks of contrition, and very feelingly too, not|with&s;tanding

that pride and her fir&s;t love fixed on Lothario &s;eem to rule her heart: in the fourth act &s;cene with him &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf thus;

<P>After all, a lap&s;e in title, &s;uppo&s;e one proved, is but a very &s;light object for critici&s;m to fix on; it is like faulcons preying upon flies; e&s;pecially in re&s;pect of this piece, which exhibits a regular plot; &s;cenes well arranged, characters happily delineated, elegant ver&s;ification, and in&s;tructive &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Sciolto is a nobleman in principles as well as rank; apparently nice in his honour, delicate in his patronage, and warm in his parental affection; ea|ger for the happine&s;s of a darling daughter, and the &s;on of a valued friend, whom he has married her to, on the mo&s;t generous, di&s;intere&s;ted principles; his mi&s;erable di&s;appointment in &s;uch a commendable expectation, places him in a &s;ituation that wakes the tendere&s;t pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Of all the performers we have &s;een in this cha|racter, Mr. POWELL &s;tood eminently foremo&s;t; there was a degree of the pathos about this gentle|man in old men never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in our recollection, except by Mr. GARRICK, who mu&s;t have carried every line of Sciolto to the heart; however, the tran&s;itions of countenance, the breaks of expre&s;&s;ion, and melting cadences of grief, were as happily &s;up|plied by Mr. POWELL as public ta&s;te could wi&s;h;

long, very long, will the parental parts in tragedy labour under the material deficiency of his untimely lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. BERRY u&s;ed to blubber through the part from beginning to end, and Mr. SPARKS was mo&s;t laboriou&s;ly uncouth; Mr. AICKIN makes a very meagre figure in it at pre&s;ent in Drury Lane, wan|ting both characteri&s;tic &s;pirit and tenderne&s;s; at Covent Garden there is not even a faint apology for the part.</P>
<P>Altamont is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of generous and &s;incere, but very weak principles; &s;o much the dupe of love that every other feeling gives way: he is introduced under &s;uch unlucky circum&s;tances, and plays &s;o much upon him&s;elf, that to an audience he appears much more languid, than the author intended, and for this rea&s;on, he is in general given to &s;ome actor as in&s;ipid as they imagine him; this &s;tamps him contemptible, and indeed lays him a dead weight upon the play; we remember Mr. BAR|RY, by exertion of &s;ingular merit, making him as re&s;pectable as any other character in the piece, though Mr. GARRICK did Lothario, and Mr. SHERIDAN Horatio, upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion; in|deed he &s;o much out-figured his competitors, in the race of fame, and illu&s;trated &s;o beautifully a character &s;carce known before, that he appeared to great ad|vantage; we have al&s;o &s;een Mr. ROSS with particular &s;atisfaction, and undoubtedly, if his fits of negli|gence could be kept off, he has every requi&s;ite to bear up Altamont agreeably.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="285">Mr. DYER, who &s;hould never ri&s;e above Tre&s;&s;el, in tragedy, has been often &s;hoved on for him, which has ever reminded us of a &s;mart tavern wai|ter; full of him&s;elf, &s;nip, &s;napping the harmonious lines of Rowe into fritters of poetry; we could name &s;ome others equally trifling, but not having words &s;uitable to the wretchedne&s;s of their attempts, we &s;hall pa&s;s them as the managers &s;hould have done, unnoticed.</P>
<P>Horatio is an amiable and valuable character, yet hurried by the zeal of friend&s;hip into trepa&s;&s;es upon decorum; his intention we approve, but his manner of acco&s;ting Cali&s;ta, and &s;tigmatizing Alta|mont is very cen&s;urable; his rea&s;oning &s;eems cool, yet his proceedings are precipitate: Mr. QUIN was greatly admired in this part, for what we cannot &s;ay, unle&s;s mere weight and pompo&s;ity of expre&s;&s;ion were deemed a meritorious contra&s;t to the &s;pirited vivacity of Lothario; his per&s;on was no doubt &s;uita|bly adapted, but a laborious formality of action of|fended the critical eye, and a monotonous cadence of voice palled the di&s;tingui&s;hing ear&mdash;Rowe's golden lines hung heavy on his expre&s;&s;ion, and by their mea&s;ured harmony, led him into mo&s;t weari&s;ome recitative of tragedy.</P>

&s;econds &s;hoved them forwards very ungraciou&s;ly to midwife his &s;hort reply into Lothario's hearing; this gentleman had a fine level, and deep tone of voice, but mi&s;applied them &s;o barbarou&s;ly, that he growled with the one, and chanted with the other.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN who&s;e voice and per&s;on, as we have before ob&s;erved, rather &s;peak again&s;t him, e&s;pecially in points of importance; neverthele&s;s made a more ma&s;terly figure in this part than any per&s;on we have &s;een; he broke with cha&s;te judg|ment the lines into good &s;en&s;e, without violating ju&s;t harmony; he &s;u&s;tained the &s;edatene&s;s of the charac|ter, and the &s;pirit of it, with equal propriety, and had the merit of much greater uniformity, than any competitor we &s;hall, or can mention; cool without &s;amene&s;s, firm without brutality.</P>
<P>Mr. MOSSOP, with an excellent voice, and a very ju&s;t idea of his author's meaning, was neverthele&s;s un|couth; painfully &s;ententious when calm, ungen|teely violent when warm, offen&s;ively con&s;equential in deportment, abominably au&s;tere in feature, full of di&s;agreeable con&s;equence, and moved methodically by the affected rules of premeditate deportment; yet he too had his numerous admirers.</P>

<P>Lothario is the mo&s;t reproachable character our moral author ever drew, and indeed as dangerous a one as we know; like the &s;nake with a beauteous variegated &s;kin, which lures the unguarded hand to a poi&s;onous touch; this licentious gallant, gilds his pernicious principles with very delu&s;ive qualifica|tions, e&s;pecially for the fair &s;ex, which cannot be more plainly evinced than by a declaration which has often been made at the repre&s;entation of this piece, by volatile, unthinking females; who have not &s;crupled &s;aying, that they would rather be deceived by &s;uch a pretty fellow as Lothario, than counte|nance &s;uch a con&s;tant, pa&s;&s;ive, in&s;ipid creature as Altamont; yet, upon examination, we do not find one trace of intrin&s;ic merit in his compo&s;ition; he is &s;prightly, voluble, amorous and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome courage; but the rever&s;e &s;hews him vain, &s;uper|ficial, incon&s;tant and malevolent; capable not only of ruining a credulous woman who loves him, but on pretence of re&s;entment again&s;t the man who has

<P>Mrs. CIBBER, beyond every point of di&s;pute, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed not only contemporary merit, but what has &s;ucceeded even to this day; the idea of haugh|tine&s;s &s;he rather failed in, yet her pungent and un|equalled di&s;tre&s;s made ample amends: in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fifth act her countenance &s;o aptly paint|ed horror and de&s;pair, her thrilling voice &s;o pene|trated the heart, that we may &s;ay from experience, the height of critical plea&s;ure &s;trained nature into a degree of mental pain.</P>
<P>Mrs. BELLAMY wanted con&s;equence &s;till more than Mrs. CIBBER, was le&s;s expre&s;&s;ive in features, and more limited in voice; yet the pa&s;&s;ages of ten|derne&s;s were well &s;upported by her; of the&s;e two ladies we mu&s;t make one general remark, equally chargeable to both; that is, having a &s;trong taint of the old fa&s;hioned titumti utterance.</P>
<P>Mrs. WOFFINGTON, through an unaccountable turn of public caprice, was very well received in Cali&s;ta, though all her merit was comprehended in elegance of figure; &s;he was a Lady Townly in heroics, and barked out the penitent with as di&s;&s;o|nant notes of voice as ever offended a critical ear; we allow &s;he was very plea&s;ing to the eye, but high|ly offen&s;ive to cultivated ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Mrs. YATES happily conveys the pride and vio|lence of Cali&s;ta, but, as we apprehend, falls very
<PB N="276" REF="290">
&s;hort of her di&s;tre&s;s; in this character, as well as &s;ome others, we are to lament, that the lady ju&s;t mentioned, &s;hould indulge a ma&s;culine extravagance of Frenchified action; that &s;he &s;hould &s;aw the air with her arms, and labour for attitude where it is rather &s;uperfluous; this may plea&s;e the million, but is no point of real merit, and can only be deem|ed a pitiful trap to catch pro&s;tituted applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. BARRY, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;advantage of an inexpre&s;&s;ive, though engaging countenance, &s;tands in our view next to Mrs. CIBBER; if &s;he is fainter in the pathetic than that lady, and le&s;s con|&s;equential than Mrs. YATES, yet &s;he is certainly more uniform through the whole than either; and has a very evident advantage of both in figure and deportment.</P>
<P>Lavinia is a mere make-&s;hift to eke out the piece; amiable; and what &s;he &s;ays is pretty enough; we don't remember to have ever &s;een her rendered more agreeable than by Mrs. STEPHENS; who, in this, as well as all other medium parts, marks the author's meaning with very ju&s;t and agreeable &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The genius of ROWE &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t in rich|ne&s;s of fancy, purity of language, ju&s;tne&s;s of images, and harmony of numbers; but was undoubtedly too poetical for the drama, of which every piece he wrote, as well as this, is an evident proof; indeed, the ab&s;urd manner of theatrical &s;peaking in his time might lead him to monotony in compo&s;ition, and jingling rhimes at the end of acts; the only

<HEAD>The MERCHANT of VENICE. Written by SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>WE have neither affixed the &s;tile of tragedy, comedy, nor that of the mingled &s;pecies to this piece, becau&s;e it does not properly come under any of tho&s;e denominations; at the opening, we are pre|&s;ented with Antonio, who, confe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf low-&s;pirited, is rallied by two friends, as being thoughtful on account of his merchandize, which charge, how|ever, he denies; Ba&s;&s;anio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano en|ter upon their conver&s;ation; the latter al&s;o attacks An|tonio upon his gloomy vi&s;age, and je&s;ts very plea|&s;antly on the affectation of gravity, worn by &s;ome men as a &s;emblance of wi&s;dom; the exit of this humori&s;t is &s;o whim&s;ical and &s;udden, that it would &s;eem as if he was only brought on to teize the mer|chant with his rhap&s;odical lecture.</P>
<P>The manner of Ba&s;&s;anio's di&s;clo&s;ing his nece&s;&s;itous condition, is very plea&s;ing and &s;uitable to confidential friend&s;hip; his a&s;&s;imilation of venturing a fre&s;h proof of the merchant's kindne&s;s, after &s;ome he has alrea|dy made away with, to the &s;chool-boy's &s;hooting one arrow in &s;earch of another, is fraught with beautiful &s;implicity; Antonio's reproof for his friend's u&s;ing &s;uch circumlocution is affectingly ge|nerous; as is the manner of promi&s;ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance when he hears Ba&s;&s;anio's de&s;ign: to lend even when we have the means in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is a very
<PB N="279" REF="293">
liberal act; but to &s;train credit for a friend, as Anto|nio here propo&s;es, lays an enormous weight of obli|gation upon gratitude.</P>
<P>The &s;cene between Portia and Neri&s;&s;a is wrote with much vivacity and great good &s;en&s;e; there is a plea&s;ing peculiarity of &s;entiment, with pregnant brevity of expre&s;&s;ion; from the conver&s;ation of the&s;e females we find, that Portia's father, by will, has fixed the determination of her marriage, upon chu&s;ing right from three ca&s;kets of gold, &s;ilver and lead; the fame of her riches, beauty, and the oddity of winning her by a kind of matrimonial lottery, has drawn many &s;uitors; of all whom, &s;eparately, Portia gives a very ludicrous and &s;arca&s;tical account, e&s;pecially of the Engli&s;h baron and the Scots lord; upon Neri&s;&s;a's mention of Ba&s;&s;anio, her opinion &s;oft|ens into the favourable.</P>
<P>Ba&s;&s;anio and Shylock approach next; the former, as it appears, &s;olliciting a loan of three thou&s;and ducats, on the credit of Antonio; as the Jew is a very peculiar character, SHAKESPEARE, according to the cu&s;tom of his unbounded genius, has furni&s;h|ed him with a peculiar mode of expre&s;&s;ion; his pon|dering upon the hazards attending property at &s;ea is the u&s;urer to a hair&mdash;Upon Antonio's entrance, the I&s;raelite makes us acquainted with his motives of antipathy again&s;t the merchant: the fir&s;t of which, his lending out money gratis, &s;hews Shylock to be flin|ty-hearted: indeed, hating his nation, and per&s;onally reviling him, lay a ju&s;t foundation for di&s;like; how|ever, we find, that, like a thorough-paced villain, he
<PB N="280" REF="294">
acco&s;ts Antonio with a fair face: when mention is made of neither lending or taking money upon advantage, Shylock enters into the defence of u&s;ury by a &s;criptural allu&s;ion. Here, our author, though he highly &s;upports character, deviates from delicacy concerning the &s;heep: in Antonio's reply there is a mo&s;t veritable &s;troke of &s;atire upon tho&s;e, who ju&s;ti|fy not only error, but infamy from holy writ;
<Q><L>Mark you this Ba&s;&s;anio,</L>
<L>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpo&s;e:</L></Q></P>
<P>Shylock, like other pur&s;e-proud knaves, who take liberties with tho&s;e who borrow money of them, ra|ther rates the merchant, who by generous and &s;pi|rited contempt, reduces the mercenary &s;ycophant to &s;ubtle fawning; the penalty he propo&s;es on the bond, &s;hews him &s;o provident a villain, that he pre|pares even for a po&s;&s;ibility of wreeking his mortal hatred; there is &s;omething very artful when Ba&s;|&s;anio declares again&s;t the merchant's &s;igning &s;uch a bond, in Shylock's throwing an imputation of vil|lainy on Chri&s;tians, through their &s;u&s;picion of other men.</P>
<P>The &s;econd act begins with a &s;cene, omitted in repre&s;entation, but why we know not, between the prince of Morocco and Portia, as preparative to his trying the ca&s;kets.</P>
<P>Launcelot, the Jew's man, in a very whim&s;ical &s;oliloquy, communicates an intention of running away from his ma&s;ter; the contention between his con&s;cience and the fiend, is truly laughable; old Gobbo's introduction means no more than to give
<PB N="281" REF="295">
Launcelot an opportunity to di&s;play his quibbling, word-catching humour; we wi&s;h the &s;cene had a better tendency than mere whim: upon Ba&s;&s;anio's entrance, the father and &s;on attack him in a very odd manner, to take the latter into his &s;ervice, which he good naturedly con&s;ents to; this piece of good luck occa&s;ions a di&s;&s;ertation upon the ridiculous &s;tudy of palme&s;try, divertingly &s;atirical.</P>
<P>When Gratiano comes to &s;olicit the liberty of going to Belmont with Ba&s;&s;anio, he is warned to check his &s;kipping &s;pirit, to which he makes a very ludicrous profe&s;&s;ion of gravity.</P>
<P>When Launcelot appears, taking leave of Je&s;&s;ica, we do not approve the expre&s;&s;ion of her "father's hou&s;e being Hell, and he a merry devil," nor do we reli&s;h Launcelot's in&s;inuation of her being got by a Chri&s;tian: after he goes off, the young Jewe&s;s &s;ignifies her hopes of delivery from bondage, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her lover Lorenzo; the next &s;hort &s;cene is nothing more than preparative for putting the &s;aid de&s;ign into execution.</P>
<P>In the &s;cene between Shylock, Launcelot and Je&s;|&s;ica, we find the Jew &s;o much alarmed at the idea of ma&s;king in the &s;treets, that he gives Je&s;&s;ica a very punctual and po&s;itive charge to &s;hut out even the &s;ound of &s;hallow foppery, as he calls it&mdash;we wonder our author did not make the Jew mention having Antonio bound, which, with exulting hopes of get|ting the forfeit, would have made him much more re&s;pectable in this &s;cene, wherein he is now rather
<PB N="282" REF="296">
languid; telling his daughter the circum&s;tance, might have agreeably contra&s;ted her humanity to his male|volence.</P>
<P>The introduction of a &s;ong by Lorenzo, under Je&s;&s;ica's window, affords her more &s;uitable time for change of dre&s;s, than the author has allowed, and is plea&s;ing enough; yet we hold it rather incon&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;&s;ential privacy of &s;tealing her away; however &s;he gets &s;afe into her lover's arms, well fur|ni&s;hed with jewels and ducats: Morochius's trial of the ca&s;kets affords &s;ome very noble flights of fancy, and plau&s;ible, tho' fallacious rea&s;oning for his fixing on the golden one, which in&s;tead of the lady, furni&s;hes him with an excellent le&s;&s;on in the follow|ing lines.</P>
<Q><L>All that gli&s;ters is not gold;</L>
<L>Often have you heard that told:</L>
<L>Many a man his life hath &s;old</L>
<L>But my out&s;ide to behold:</L>
<L>Gilded wood may worms enfold&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>In the &s;hort &s;ucceeding &s;cene, between Salanio and Solarino, an admirable de&s;cription is given of the Jew's di&s;traction at his daughter's elopement; &s;ome hints are thrown out judiciou&s;ly to wake our appre|hen&s;ion for Antonio's bond, and a mo&s;t amiable picture is drawn of his unlimited friend&s;hip for Ba&s;&s;anio.</P>
<P>The prince of Arragon appears next as a &s;uitor of Portia; this &s;cene, as well as tho&s;e of Morochius, is omitted in repre&s;entation, and we think very blameably, as the progre&s;&s;ive regularity of de&s;ign is thereby interrupted, and many excellent reflections
<PB N="283" REF="297">
withheld from the audience on a train of &s;ophi&s;tical deductions; the fir&s;t candidate per&s;uaded his erring judgment to fix on gold, the &s;econd has &s;en&s;e enough on reading the label, "who chu&s;eth me &s;hall gain what many men de&s;ire," to reject exter|nal o&s;tentation, yet is &s;o vain as to think highly of his own de&s;erts, and therefore chu&s;es where the in|&s;cription of the ca&s;ket runs thus, "who chu&s;es me &s;hall get as much as he de&s;erves," pre&s;uming that the lady only can be the reward of his exalted me|rit; the &s;atire couched in his finding the portrait of an idiot is keen and comprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, Salanio and Solarino, acquaint the audience, with Antonio's lo&s;s of a rich &s;hip; Shylock, foaming with rage, joins them; never were tran&s;itions from one pa&s;&s;ion to another better &s;upported than in this &s;cene; di&s;|traction, grief, and malevolence &s;ucceed and cro&s;s each other admirably, nor can any thing be more happily conceived than the Jew's ju&s;tification of his own cruelty upon the common rights and &s;en&s;ati|ons of nature, equally incident to his tribe and Chri&s;tians; upon Tubal's appearance, his agitation ri&s;es &s;till higher, and every line that pa&s;&s;es between them is excellently imagined to di&s;play the united powers of action and utterance.</P>
<P>Ba&s;&s;anio now appears as the third candidate for Portia, and has the advantage of her good wi&s;hes for his &s;ucce&s;s; his reflections, previous to fixing a choice, are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly argumentative, and beauti|fully ju&s;t; fancy and judgment form a cordial union

&mdash;he &s;ucceeds happily to him&s;elf, and agreeably to the lady, by rejecting the ca&s;kets of glaring and mer|cenary &s;how; by fixing on humble and unpromi&s;ing lead; this ju&s;tifies the &s;eemingly odd de&s;ign of Por|tia's father, who it appears meant by the propo&s;ed choice, to get her a hu&s;band of &s;olid under&s;tanding; the court&s;hip of Gratiano and Neri&s;&s;a, is &s;ome|what odd; Portia's prejudice, in favour of Ba&s;&s;anio, ari&s;es naturally enough from previous knowledge of him, but for the other couple to make &s;o &s;udden a matrimonial contract, &s;trains the bounds of proba|bility; and for Gratiano, who moves in the &s;phere of a gentleman, &s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to pick up a waiting woman for his wife, is rather a precipitate and unac|countable piece of match-making; however, a double wedding is fixed on, to the &s;atisfaction of all parties &mdash;the introduction of Lorenzo and Je&s;&s;ica, before they could be a&s;certained of Ba&s;&s;anio's authority to entertain them, is rather exceptionable; however, the letter brought from Antonio, acquainting his friend with the &s;tate of bankruptcy he is reduced to, gives a fine turn to affairs; Ba&s;&s;anio's method of unfold|ing the lamentable ca&s;e to Portia, is pathetically de|licate, and her de&s;ire of paying the bond, even twenty times over, to avoid the fatal penalty, amia|bly generous; as is al&s;o di&s;patching her de&s;tined hu&s;band for the re&s;cue of his friend, even before marriage rites are celebrated.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing &s;cene where Antonio &s;ollicits Shy|lock has nothing more in it than a confirmation of the Jew's unrelenting determination to abide by his
<PB N="285" REF="299">
bond; we are certain our author might have very much improved both characters in this interview, had extending them occurred to his imagination; characters of importance &s;hould never be brought on for trifling purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;cene where Portia gives charge of her hou&s;e and family to Lorenzo, that &s;he and Neri&s;&s;a may go to a mona&s;tery, during her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence, is prettily devi&s;ed, to keep the intended metamor|pho&s;e &s;ecret, and, at the &s;ame time, to apologize for <HI>her</HI> ab&s;ence; the intimation &s;he drops to her con|fidante, of a&s;&s;uming ma&s;culine appearances, awakens curio&s;ity in an audience, and at the &s;ame time leaves that curio&s;ity in &s;u&s;pence: there is an indelicate in|&s;inuation at the beginning of Portia's &s;peech, when &s;he mentions the change of habit, which we wi&s;h was omitted; by the la&s;t line of this &s;cene it ap|pears, that twenty miles will carry them to Venice; yet, upon Ba&s;&s;anio's &s;etting out for Belmont, we hear of his embarking on &s;hip board; this &s;eems one of the incon&s;i&s;tencies our author was very apt to &s;lip into.</P>
<P>Launcelot's wittici&s;ms with Je&s;&s;ica, are in a &s;train of drollery, but his allu&s;ion to Scylla and Charyb|dis, is rather too cla&s;&s;ical for &s;uch a character, and his very impertinent behaviour is hardly ju&s;tifiable in a &s;ervant; the circum&s;tance mentioned by Lo|renzo, relative to his amour with a Moori&s;h woman, has no wit or humour to apologize for mentioning the matter before Je&s;&s;ica.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="300">On Shylock's being introduced to the court of ju|dicature, to which he has applied for the penalty of his bond, the duke pathetically interpo&s;es in the mer|chant's favour; to which the I&s;raelite replies, with all the &s;hrewdne&s;s of determined cruelty, urging his antipathy as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, for ca&s;ting a&s;ide every humane principle; per&s;ua&s;ion only &s;eems to invigorate his helli&s;h re&s;olution, which not even the offer of enormous pecuniary advantage can alter: when matters are at this cri&s;is, the appearance of Portia as a lawyer, recommended by Doctor Bellario brings on the trial; however, Portia previou&s;ly gives a mo&s;t nervous and beautiful recommendation of mercy, which is &s;o worthy the approbation and recollection of every individual that we &s;hould be blameable in not quoting of it.</P>
<Q><L>The quality of mercy is not &s;train'd;</L>

<L>But mercy is above this &s;ceptred &s;way,</L>

<P>However we may admire the expre&s;&s;ion and be|nevolent tendency of this &s;peech, yet an obvious ob|jection lies again&s;t the pa&s;&s;age marked by italics; which, as it evidently refers to the Lords's Prayer, ought not to be even hinted at, where a Jew was in que&s;tion, as it would rather work an irritative than lenitive effect.</P>
<P>Shylock's &s;ervile and rapturous adoration of the &s;uppo&s;ed lawyer, for &s;u&s;taining the &s;olidity of the bond, is inimitably expre&s;&s;ed by exclamations; and the cau&s;e works up again&s;t Antonio to a very pathe|tic cri&s;is; when a very natural and mo&s;t agreeable turn of Portia's, defeats the Jew's blood-thir&s;ty hopes, frees the merchant, and gives general joy: there is not any incident in any drama, which &s;trikes &s;o &s;udden and &s;o powerful an effect; the retorts of Gratiano are admirably plea&s;ant, and the wretched &s;tate to which Shylock is in his turn reduced, is &s;o agreeable a &s;a|crifice to ju&s;tice, that it conveys inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;ati&s;|faction to every feeling mind; the lenity of Antonio is judiciou&s;ly oppo&s;ed to the malevolence of his inex|orable per&s;ecutor.</P>
<P>Upon the Jew's leaving court, Gratiano &s;peaks thus to him: "In chri&s;tening thou &s;halt have two godfathers, had I been judge thou &s;hould&s;t have had ten more, to bring thee to the gallows, not the font;" in this &s;peech our author has made a very cen&s;urable &s;lip, by furni&s;hing Gratiano, who is a
<PB N="288" REF="302">
Venetian, with an ob&s;ervation that refers to the En|gli&s;h mode of trial by jury, which the words quoted certainly imply.</P>
<P>What follows to the end of this act, is only a &s;tra|tagem of the ladies to get tho&s;e rings from their hu&s;bands, which they had made them &s;wear not to part with; hence ari&s;es &s;ome matter to eke forward a piece which &s;hould undoubtedly have ended with the trial, as no event of equal force could follow the merchant's acquittal.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, Lorenzo and Je&s;&s;ica, in a &s;train of tender dalliance, play upon the idea of a &s;erene moon-light night very agreeably, till they are interrupted by a me&s;&s;enger, &s;ignifying Portia's return, and Launcelot roaring out in &s;imple ec&s;tacy his ma&s;ter's approach; Lorenzo, however, willing to enjoy the beauty of the night, indulges fanciful &s;peculation in the following elegant &s;train:
<Q><L>How &s;weet the moonlight &s;leeps upon this bank,</L>
<L>Here will we &s;it, and let the &s;ounds of mu&s;ic</L>
<L>Creep in our ears; &s;oft &s;tillne&s;s and the night</L>
<L>Become the touches of &s;weet harmony:</L>
<L>Sit Je&s;&s;ica; look how the floor of heav'n,</L>

<L>But whil&s;t this muddy ve&s;ture of decay</L>
<L>Doth clo&s;e us in; we cannot hear it.</L></Q></P>

<P>Though the lines in Italics have been often quoted, and received, as conveying an irrefragable maxim, we mu&s;t contend that there is con&s;iderably more fancy than truth in them, as experience &s;ufficiently proves, from a multitude of in&s;tances of bad ears being annexed to good hearts; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that one of the greate&s;t writers one of the deepe&s;t &s;cholars, one of the mo&s;t moral and peaceable men of the pre&s;ent age, has &s;o little reli&s;h for mu&s;ic, that being carried to hear Alexander's Fea&s;t, as &s;et by HAN|DEL, he &s;hook his head, and &s;aid, the performance only convinced him, that in&s;ipid, jingling &s;ounds,

<P>This play breaks in upon the unities of time and place materially, however, the plot is not very ir|regular, and the &s;cenes fall into a tolerable arrange|ment; we mu&s;t con&s;ider the fifth act but as a kind of after-game, though agreeably &s;upported; and repeat our wi&s;h, that Shylock's defeat, with a di&s;|covery of the ladies in court, had formed the cata|&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Though we cannot trace a general moral, yet from many pa&s;&s;ages, u&s;eful, in&s;tructive inferences may be drawn, particularly the choice of the ca&s;kets, which &s;hews that humility and judgment obtain me|ritoriou&s;ly, what o&s;tentation and vanity lo&s;e; from the Jew's fate may be learned, that per&s;evering cru|elty is very capable of drawing ruin on it&s;elf&mdash;in tho&s;e &s;cenes where &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ions of dig|nity are requi&s;ite, we find them amply provided, in le&s;s material pa&s;&s;ages, both are trifling.</P>

<P>We remember to have &s;een Mr. SHERIDAN in this part with great plea&s;ure; he &s;eemed to have a very happy conception, yet fell &s;omewhat &s;hort in the executive part; through the fir&s;t &s;cene we deem him quite equal to Mr. MACKLIN, and in that &s;peech where the Jew tells Antonio of the abu&s;e he has vent|ed on him, we mu&s;t allow him &s;ome little &s;uperiority; but in the third and fourth acts, compari&s;on mu&s;t &s;hew him to di&s;advantage.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s MACKLIN undoubtedly &s;peaks the part in an unexceptionable manner, but we deem her rather too petit in per&s;on and expre&s;&s;ion; Mrs. CLIVE, who obtained no &s;mall &s;hare of applau&s;e, was a ludi|crous burle&s;que on the character, every feature and limb contra&s;ted the idea SHAKESPEARE gives us of Portia; in the &s;pirited &s;cene &s;he was clum&s;y, and &s;poke them in the &s;ame &s;train of chambermaid deli|cacy &s;he did Lappet or Flippanta; in the grave part&mdash;&s;ure never was &s;uch a female put into breech|es before!&mdash;&s;he was aukwardly di&s;&s;onant; and, as if con&s;cious &s;he could not get through without the aid of trick, flew to the pitiful re&s;ource of taking off the peculiarity of &s;ome judge, or noted lawyer; from which wi&s;e &s;troke, &s;he created laughter in a &s;cene where the deepe&s;t attention &s;hould be pre&s;erved, till Gratiano's retorts upon the Jew, work a contrary effect.</P>

<HEAD>The COMMISSARY. A COMEDY by Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<P>CRitici&s;ms upon authors or performers who have paid the debt of nature, are apt to be con&s;idered by many per&s;ons as the effect of prejudice, good na|turedly weak, or enviou&s;ly &s;evere; tho&s;e upon liv|ing per&s;ons, of either character, are generally &s;up|po&s;ed as the offspring of intere&s;ted views, per&s;onal attachment, or partial antipathy: however, as we have heitherto endeavoured, and we hope &s;ucce&s;sful|ly, to hold the ballance with an unbia&s;&s;ed hand; as we di&s;claim all connections with, or per&s;onal influence from the pieces or actors con&s;idered; as we have indi&s;criminately prai&s;ed the &s;ame authors and per|formers in one place, whom we have cen&s;ured in an|other, it is ardently hoped we &s;hall &s;tand, through our whole undertaking, unimpeached with &s;ervile flattery, or illiberal cen&s;ure; and that what we offer will be received as real, though often, perhaps, very fallible opinion; we have already &s;hared the com|mon fate of all &s;imilar productions; that is, being deemed too mild by &s;ome, too tart by others; as it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e all, we &s;hall &s;till &s;teer a &s;teady medium cour&s;e, and prove our&s;elves &s;trict friends of the drama, though &s;ome of its &s;ons and pro&s;elytes &s;hould look upon us with indignant eyes.</P>
<P>If to laugh vice and folly out of countenance, is a more certain, as well as more plea&s;ant method of
<PB N="300" REF="314">
reforming national conduct into prudence and virtue, than dry declamation, or brow-beating authority; if to &s;hoot folly as it flies, and to catch living man|ners, be the grand ta&s;te of merit in comic writings, we mu&s;t examine how far the gentleman now before us, has, in the piece we are going to con&s;ider, an&s;wer|ed tho&s;e valuable purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons of low extraction, low capacities for any thing but gain, low fortunes and lower prin|ciples, having accumulated princely fortunes by plunder from their bleeding country, and tho&s;e har|dy &s;ons of war who were fighting for the common li|berties of Europe, became &s;o extravagantly vain of their &s;udden ill gotten pelf, that they wanted to &s;hine forth what nature never de&s;igned them for, and art could not make them accompli&s;hed gentlemen; one particularly, though in the vale of years, aimed as ignorantly at cutting a figure in the gay and great world; unbounded riches &s;ecure &s;uch reptiles from legal puni&s;hment; who then can be fitter game for dramatic &s;atire to hunt with her keen la&s;h through the mazes of ridicule?</P>
<P>Availing him&s;elf mo&s;t happily of &s;uch a luxuriant &s;ubject, the author of the COMMISSARY has titled his piece from the very &s;tation in which &s;ome of the ra|pacious blood-&s;uckers moved, and lays the &s;cene of it in the hou&s;e of a lady, Mrs. Mechlin, for whom, if we are rightly informed, there is an infamous liv|ing original; her handmaid Jenny remarks, upon loud knocking at the door, that the Commi&s;&s;ary's lodging in their hou&s;e, occa&s;ions bu&s;ine&s;s enough for

<P>Simon's &s;triking portrait enflames Jenny, who on hearing her mi&s;tre&s;s at the door, puts him into an apprehen&s;ion that &s;he'll reveal his &s;entiments; how|ever, &s;he gives the matter a whim&s;ical turn, and brings him off&mdash;nothing can be more naturally cha|racteri&s;tic than Mrs. Mechlin's importance, di&s;play|ed in wearine&s;s and fretful breaks; the coachman is al&s;o furni&s;hed with expre&s;&s;ions highly &s;uitable, and though, the craving, extortionate di&s;po&s;ition of &s;uch fellows, may be deemed a trifling, it is yet a ju&s;t ob|ject of expo&s;ition, and is here placed in a very laugh|able point of view.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="316">What en&s;ues, when Mrs. Mechlin enquires if any body has called upon her, may be called the &s;corpi|on's &s;ting of well merited &s;atire, darted at tho&s;e in the great world, who be&s;tow, through &s;uch vile a|gents, even church preferments upon tho&s;e who will flatter or help to conceal their vices; by marrying a ca&s;t off mi&s;tre&s;s, or making any &s;ordid conce&s;&s;ion, an hone&s;t mind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;tart at, though wrapped in a ru&s;ty ca&s;&s;oc, and the impoveri&s;hed drudge of a penurious Cumberland curacy.</P>
<P>The &s;troke of a pearl necklace belonging to a lady who is gone to Mrs. Cornelys's, is an exqui&s;ite re|membrance to many of the fair &s;ex, who lavi&s;h health, beauty, and fortune, not only in Soho Square, but in many other places of polite re&s;ort; which reduce them often to the &s;hameful re&s;ource of pawning, not only their moveables for a little pre|&s;ent &s;upply, but al&s;o their honours for the indul|gence of a little credit from fortunate antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>Upon Jenny's going out, her mi&s;tre&s;s is entering upon the communication of an important concern; but is interrupted by the appearance of Widow Loveit; this amorous elderly lady comes as we find upon a matrimonial errand; to provide her&s;elf with a comfortable hu&s;band, by the kind, able a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her match-making friend, Mrs. Mechlin; the folly of age, and e&s;pecially in the female &s;ex, hunting af|ter a matrimonial connection with youth, is very humorou&s;ly &s;et forth in this &s;cene; pretended grief for one hu&s;band, attended by warm wi&s;hes for ano|ther, is poignant &s;atire again&s;t hypocritical &s;orrow;

and we know not any pa&s;&s;age of equal length, which contains more u&s;eful meaning than the following remark; "I wonder they don't add a clau&s;e to the act to prevent the old from marrying clande&s;tinely, as well as the young; I am &s;ure there are as many un&s;uitable matches at this time of life as the other."</P>
<P>After the widow's departure, Mrs. Mechlin opens the Commi&s;&s;ary's character, circum&s;tances, and pe|culiarities to Simon, whom &s;he engages in a de|&s;ign &s;he has formed of uniting her opulent lodger to a niece of her own, who has been debauched by a mu&s;ician; the part &s;he a&s;&s;igns him to appear in, is a dome&s;tic of Mi&s;s Dolly's, under the character of a Scot's earl's daughter; part of his in&s;tructions &s;he refers to another opportunity, and in &s;oliloquy re|flects upon the precariou&s;ne&s;s of her own bu&s;ine&s;s, which occa&s;ions her to drop &s;evere, though oblique hints again&s;t &s;ome di&s;&s;olute per&s;ons of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Upon Dolly Mechlin's appearance, the provident aunt urges her to &s;ign a conditional bond in return for helping her to &s;o advantageous a marriage; the niece's he&s;itation upon this matter enflames her &s;o much, that &s;he enters into a warm recapitulation of the favours &s;he has conferred, and &s;tigmatizes the character of Dr. Catgut with ju&s;t &s;everity; this in|timidates the young woman to compliance; the ap|proach of I&s;aac Fungus, brother to the Commi&s;&s;ary, breaks off their conference.</P>
<P>This rough citizen, having met with nobody but a Frenchman, who can't &s;peak Engli&s;h, to give him an an&s;wer, vents his rage upon the alarmed valet; upon Mrs. Mechlin's appearance, he complains of the

<P>The two brothers and Mrs. Mechlin, begin the &s;econd act, when the Commi&s;&s;ary, teeming with ideas of gentility, rates the more rational cit in a ludicrous &s;tile, and by having the lady of his party, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to flatter his peculiarities, he humourou&s;ly triumphs in his &s;uppo&s;ed advantage of ta&s;te and judgement; the extreme folly of a man advanced in years, putting him&s;elf under tuition for tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which only appertain to youth, is here expo&s;ed with infinite plea&s;antry; the di&s;&s;ertation upon fencing, the &s;uppo&s;ed quarrel, the confu&s;ion of Wilkins, Hopkins, and Jenkins, as names of the per&s;on quarrelled with; I&s;aac's interruptions, and at la&s;t fencing with Mrs. Mech|lin,

<P>The tran&s;ition to Zac Fungus's marriage, is a va|riation of merit, and his account of the lady's pe|digree, makes a &s;trong &s;atirical appeal to ri&s;ible fa|culties; the latter part of this &s;cene is &s;u&s;tained with great &s;pirit, and throws out &s;ome excellent hints of the wretched dependency a per&s;on of inferi|or rank mu&s;t reduce him&s;elf to, who ridiculou&s;ly marries a woman merely for the pride of blood.</P>
<P>The introduction of Mr. Gruel, a ma&s;ter of oratory, gives a fre&s;h turn to conver&s;ation, and &s;ets the Commi&s;&s;ary's whim&s;ical weakne&s;s in a diver|ting point of view; it is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel &s;trongly, the account he gives of tho&s;e means by which we &s;peak, and of the di&s;tinctions be|tween a &s;mall mouth and a large one, illu&s;trated by whi&s;tling and bawling&mdash;Gruel's pedantic, methodi|cal mode of expre&s;&s;ion, is a keen reproach to tho&s;e who undertake to teach others, what they are not capable of them&s;elves; and the oration, which Fungus delivers, as a &s;pecimen of his abilities, is a truly laughable piece of circumlocution; mention of his riding-ma&s;ter being in waiting, carries off this oratorical pupil, who apologizes for his ab|rupt departure, by ob&s;erving, that his de&s;ire to be a fini&s;hed gentleman, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, puts it out of his power to &s;tick long to any one thing.</P>

<P>Dr. Catgut's &s;cene with Mrs. Mechlin, paints, in &s;trong colours, the ab&s;urdities of a man who&s;e ge|nius will be long admired, but who&s;e conduct has much ob&s;cured it with a cloud of indi&s;cretions, to give them no wor&s;e a title: his declining the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, in which the public has allowed him pecu|liar merit, to commence poet, for which character he has not the &s;malle&s;t capability, is well hit off; and the two &s;tanza's introduced, are an excellent burle&s;que upon the in&s;ignificant, namby-pamby &s;tile of modern &s;ong-writing, &s;o much admired when equipped with a tune; at the latter end of this &s;cene, we find the doctor meditating a cheat on his good acquaintance, Mrs. Mechlin, under the &s;em|blance of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The third act opens with Harpy, a lawyer, young Loveit, the widow's &s;on, and Jenny; it ap|pears,

<P>We do not remember to have peru&s;ed or heard any dramatic author, who&s;e dialogue &s;hews a great|er degree of &s;pontaneous, entertaining &s;pirit than Mr. Foote's; if it is not enriched with ab&s;olute wit, there are neverthele&s;s many peculiar emanations of &s;entiments, and much pregnancy of expre&s;&s;ion; his characters are always alive, his incidents nouvelle, his &s;atire poignant, and all his &s;cenes free from that lan|guor which mo&s;t writers occa&s;ionally fall into; his per&s;onages, at lea&s;t the &s;triking ones, are all drawn from life, and with &s;uch a happy degree of execu|tion that they are not more generally &s;een than known; and this, we are bold to affirm, is the true way to make the &s;tage a &s;alutary &s;chool of manners.</P>
<P>Zachary Fungus and his brother, are mo&s;t excel|lently contra&s;ted; the one a dupe to extravagant notions of gay life, the other pent up in the narrow compa&s;s of mechanical ideas; the former a coxco|mical fool, the latter a rational, though unpoli&s;hed trader&mdash;Mr. Foote's performers being as tran&s;ient as &s;wallows, who appear only in &s;ummer, and almo&s;t every year change their &s;tation, we cannot pretend to enquire into the merit of any but tho&s;e mo&s;t known.</P>

in repre&s;entation; as no man can compo&s;e, &s;o no performer can act in his &s;tile, except by very faint and inadequate imitation; his features and utte|rance are equally well calculated to tickle the livelier, &s;portive feelings; which is evident from the laugha|ble effect he works upon numbers of &s;pectators, who frequently cannot comprehend the allu&s;ive meaning couched in what he &s;ays; but admire it, as Boniface does Greek, for the facility with which it is &s;poken.</P>

<HEAD>VENICE PRESERVED. A TRAGEDY by Mr. OTWAY.</HEAD>
<P>OTWAY has been de&s;ervedly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a tragic writer by the epithet tender; indeed his two living pieces, the ORPHAN, and that we are now entering upon, never fail to call a melting tribute from the heart, evidenced by tear-filled eyes; yet we may ju&s;tly compare them to a couple of females po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of bewitching features, mani|fe&s;ting offen&s;ive deformity of &s;hape.</P>
<P>Among the exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages and circum|&s;tances, we mu&s;t pa&s;s previous cen&s;ure at large upon every &s;cene where Aquilina is concerned, as &s;uper|fluou&s;ly prejudicial to regularity, offen&s;ive to de|cency, impotently ludicrous, and contemptibly ab&s;urd; as a ju&s;tification for the author, it is &s;aid, the buffoon &s;enator Antonio, was introduced to caricature the Earl of Shafte&s;bury, by order of Charles the &s;econd; a monarch more remarkable for une&s;&s;ential humour and licentious di&s;&s;ipa|tion, than moral feelings or &s;olid &s;en&s;e. His late maje&s;ty we have been informed, once ordered the &s;cenes we condemn to be re&s;tored in action; which is not &s;o much to be wondered at, if we con|&s;ider his very limited knowledge of the Engli&s;h language; however, the audience exerted their undoubted right to critical authority, and &s;natch|ing them even from royal influence, &s;entenced mo&s;t ju&s;tly &s;uch vile excre&s;&s;ences to oblivion:
<PB N="314" REF="330">
we wi&s;h they were omitted in print as well as on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>VENICE PRESERVED opens with Priuli, a &s;ena|tor, upbraiding Jaffier as the In&s;trument of di&s;|grace and perplexity to his family, by having &s;tolen his daughter; the old man's taunts are &s;e|vere, and in &s;ome places illiberal, Jaffier's defence is the real delicate offspring of a mode&s;t mind deeply affected; his de&s;cription of the circum|&s;tance which engaged Belvidera's affection, is poe|tically intere&s;ting, and ju&s;tifies her &s;tealing into a match with the per&s;on who gallantly pre&s;erved her life at the hazard of his own: Priuli's unrelenting nature, as well as the poverty of his &s;on-in-law, are laid open with natural &s;triking propriety; from what he &s;ays in his la&s;t &s;peech of this &s;cene, we are apt to pronounce dre&s;&s;ing Jaffier in rich cloaths an impropriety; it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a man, who is upon the errand of &s;ollicitation for pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould equip him&s;elf with &s;plendid garments; or, if he had done &s;o, Priuli mu&s;t naturally have &s;aid, in&s;tead of "reduce the glittering trappings of thy <HI>wife,</HI>" reduce <HI>thy</HI> glit|tering trappings&mdash;Yet we have often &s;een the au|thor's meaning rever&s;ed&mdash;Jaffier wearing a &s;uperb &s;uit, and Belvidera equipped with a plain black velvet, which is as humble an appearance as any lady can a&s;&s;ume on the &s;tage; one point we think the author might have availed him&s;elf of in this &s;cene, which would have prevented the charge of di&s;obedience again&s;t Belvidera, and the abu&s;e of confidence in Jaffier's clande&s;tinely marrying her;
<PB N="315" REF="331">
that is, to have made it appear Priuli had denied his con&s;ent to make them mutually happy; the father's carrying his re&s;entment even to the &s;econd genera|tion, and wi&s;hing that a helple&s;s infant may want bread, is a &s;hocking, and therefore blameable picture of depraved nature; he might have been drawn an ob&s;tinate, without being pictured a &s;a|vage parent; the following line of Jaffier's is a gro&s;s breach of mea&s;ure.</P>
<Q>But I might &s;end her back to you with contumely.</Q>
<P>The account of Jaffier's circum&s;tances, given by him&s;elf in his &s;oliloquy after Priuli's departure, &s;peaks to a feeling heart affectingly; Pierre, at his entrance, and in &s;ome &s;peeches afterwards, makes us agreeably acquainted with his own character; the di&s;&s;ertation upon villainy and rogues in power are admirable; however, &s;omething further on, where mention is made of Aquilina, Pierre &s;inks much in our e&s;teem; therefore the mode of re|pre&s;entation, by omitting all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, does our author a piece of ju&s;tice he &s;hould have done him&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is a great degree of dramatic policy in making Pierre unite Jaffier's &s;ufferings with tho&s;e of the public; the feelings of poverty are an ex|cellent ground for artifice to work upon; an hone&s;t mind, incumbered with care, may be very &s;u&s;cep|tible of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, as in a &s;tate of freedom it would effectually re&s;i&s;t; the picture drawn both of the national and Jaffier's private &s;ufferings, is very di&s;tinct, and highly fini&s;hed; the different parts of
<PB N="316" REF="332">
Pierre's narrative, are finely imagined and power|fully enforced; his mention of Priuli, as having &s;igned the legal authority for plundering Jaffier's dwelling, falls in well to rou&s;e that unfortunate man's mind into a &s;tate of de&s;peration; which pur|po&s;e he more effectually compleats, by his intro|duction of Belvidera as the capital figure in that group of di&s;tre&s;sful images which he has pre&s;ented to view; Jaffier's manner of receiving the melan|choly tidings, his melting only at the &s;ufferings of her he loves, recommends his character much; and his reluctance to enter upon vindictive mea&s;ures of a public nature, though irritated by private wrongs, is commendable; however, we find that Pierre &s;o far touches the ma&s;ter-&s;tring of his heart, as to pre|cipitate him into a &s;ympathetic degree of re&s;ent|ment; in con&s;equence of which, an a&s;&s;ignation is made to meet on the Rialto at midnight, which Pierre very improperly calls his <HI>evening</HI> walk of meditation; <HI>lonely</HI> would we apprehend &s;uit the &s;ea&s;on much better than <HI>evening.</HI></P>
<P>After his friend's exit, Jaffier, in a &s;hort and apt &s;oliloquy, de&s;cants on his own di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate; ju&s;tly remarking, that &s;en&s;ibility, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, mu&s;t be a &s;ource of pain; Belvidera's entrance im|mediately after the excellent preparation we have ju&s;t received for her, is happily de&s;igned; &s;he comes upon us in the double view of a mo&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ed daughter, and unhappy, though amiable wife; the tender treatment &s;he affords her afflicted hu&s;band amid&s;t misfortunes, as it &s;tands forth an in|di&s;putable
<PB N="317" REF="333">
te&s;t of inviolable affection, &s;o it conveys an admirable le&s;&s;on to the fair &s;ex; intimating, that &s;he who will not endeavour to &s;mooth the thorny pillow of adver&s;ity, does not by any means de&s;erve to participate the luxuriant down of pro&s;perity; indeed this &s;cene abounds with tho&s;e &s;oft &s;en&s;a|tions, which our author in every view expre&s;&s;es &s;o beautifully; and it clo&s;es with a &s;triking a&s;&s;imila|tion of Jaffier's misfortunes to a &s;hipwrecked mer|chant, in which is couched a delicate compliment to his faithful partner; yet, exclu&s;ive of pitiful jingle, there never were more indifferent lines than the triplet which carries them off the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Having di&s;avowed all connection with the &s;cenes of Aquilina, we &s;hall begin the &s;econd act where it commences in repre&s;entation; here we find Jaffier on the Rialto, uttering in &s;oliloquy, tho&s;e gloomy &s;entiments con&s;equent to his de&s;perate circum|&s;tances; but his adverting to the old woman's notion of Satan's per&s;onally appearing for the work of temptation is ridiculous&mdash;The cynical encounter between him and Pierre, before they know each other, is &s;uitable; and in a direct compliment to canine fidelity, throws an oblique, yet cutting and ju&s;t &s;arca&s;m on human hypocri&s;y: Pierre's con|temptuous mention of prie&s;ts and praying, though &s;omewhat founded in truth, is cen&s;urable; religion &s;hould not be treated lightly, even by a profligate upon the &s;tage; but OTWAY unfortunately lived when genius was employed to &s;neer or laugh every degree of decency out of countenance, nor indeed was &s;uch depravity of national ta&s;te to be wondered
<PB N="318" REF="334">
at, when the court was an ab&s;olute fountain of iniquity.</P>
<P>Pierre's enquiry for Belvidera, and giving his friend &s;ome money for pre&s;ent exigence, is an artful preparative for his main de&s;ign, though we cannot think the pur&s;e &s;o delicately introduced as it &s;hould have been; indeed Jaffier's ob&s;ervation upon it &s;hews, that he e&s;teems it as a bribe, and for no very amiable purpo&s;e; Pierre however pur&s;ues his plan, and by mention of Priuli, again agitates Jaffier to the purpo&s;e in view, who vents his pa&s;&s;ion in terms very illiberal, even allowing for peculiar provoca|tion; his readine&s;s to bla&s;t with cur&s;es almo&s;t the whole city, is a touch of madne&s;s; and his in&s;inua|tion re&s;pecting the wives and daughters of &s;enators abominably gro&s;s: Pierre's method of explaining his purpo&s;e is well conceived; in his friend's reply to the propo&s;ed oath of &s;ecrecy, there is another line contemptibly low,
<Q>Green-&s;ickne&s;s girls, &amp;c.</Q>
and we would prefer a material objection again&s;t Jaffier's wild declaration, that he could kill even an hone&s;t &s;enator, through the antipathy he has entertained again&s;t knavi&s;h ones.</P>
<P>From &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in this &s;cene, we are led to con&s;ider the con&s;pirators as men of &s;ublime cha|racters, how far their principles and conduct fulfil the idea, we &s;hall di&s;cover on a general &s;urvey of the piece; the place of this conference, a public bridge, &s;eems, though at midnight, but ill cho&s;en for the &s;ubject which engages their attention; a &s;ubject of
<PB N="319" REF="335">
&s;uch deep concern, as required the mo&s;t cautious, impenetrable &s;ecrecy; yet from the tenor of their words, the characters &s;peak out as if indifferent who heard them.</P>
<P>By the book we are told, that the next &s;cene lies at the hou&s;e of Aquilina, a noted Greek cour|tezan, which place of rendezvous we cannot deem very reputable for per&s;ons aiming at the glorious characters of heroes and patriots; in &s;uch a hou&s;e, however, Renault, a capital cha|racter in the con&s;piracy, pre&s;ents him&s;elf, rumi|nating in &s;ome emphatic lines, upon that dange|rous and turbulent impul&s;e of the mind&mdash;Ambi|tion, which, with great propriety, he a&s;&s;imi|lates to a beautiful elevation of pro&s;pect, placed on a &s;andy, precarious foundation.</P>
<P>From his reply to Spino&s;a, we perceive the old gentleman is of a te&s;ty di&s;po&s;ition, indeed, &s;o im|portant a tran&s;action, &s;hould not be dallied with; therefore, his impatience for the other con&s;pira|tors, is a natural and prudent feeling; his reflec|tion upon Elliot as an Engli&s;hman, is beneath the tragic mu&s;e; it &s;erves the purpo&s;e of occa&s;ioning a little miff, which Bedamar reconciles; this Be|damar, as the author has drawn him, might very well have pa&s;&s;ed for an untitled knave; but that hi&s;tory informs us he was the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who officially fomented the con&s;piracy, with a view to ruin the &s;tate of Venice; wherefore, it is &s;trange that our author did not make him a more con&s;picuous acting per&s;onage.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="336">The compliments reciprocally paid by the con|&s;pirators to each other in the Roman titles they appropriate, is truly whim&s;ical; as to Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius they may be admitted patrons of liberty; but for Cataline and Cethegus, who were notori|ous &s;ons of faction, they &s;eem an odd couple to in|troduce; Renault's de&s;cription of the Venetian &s;tate is very &s;triking, and fully ju&s;tifies taking violent mea&s;ures for redre&s;s; however, we can by no means approve the following exultation of Pierre, which &s;eems the cruel effu&s;ion of a mind delighting in mi&s;chief.</P>

In the fir&s;t &s;cene of this act he tells Pierre, that he has lodged her at the hou&s;e of a <HI>friend</HI>; it now appears, that Aquilina is that friend; a very ill cho|&s;en one for the delicate and mode&s;t Belvidera; who from her own account, has been a&s;leep in the hou&s;e of a courtezan, a hou&s;e too frequented by a number of di&s;&s;olute per&s;ons; there is, however, &s;omething

<P><PB N="323" REF="339">We apprehend &s;aying <HI>the&s;e</HI> wide &s;treets is an er|ror, as they are in a room during this &s;cene; ad|mitting Jaffier pointed out of a window to &s;hew the &s;eat of action, <HI>tho&s;e</HI> would be the grammatical term, but we &s;hould prefer the word <HI>our</HI> to either; however, this is a blemi&s;h little worth notice, where the whole pa&s;&s;age is &s;hocking to humanity&mdash;A de|licate woman to prai&s;e and love her hu&s;band for playing the a&s;&s;a&s;in even upon her own father, to place &s;uch a one as a plea&s;ed &s;pectatre&s;s of out|rageous cruelty, makes her in idea a rival to Roman Tullia; who, after cau&s;ing the death of an aged &s;ire, whirled her chariot triumphantly over his mangled limbs.</P>
<P>Belvidera very naturally &s;hrinks at what &s;he has heard, but in reproving her hu&s;band for a&s;&s;ociating with &s;uch an abandoned blood-thir&s;ty crew, &s;he de|&s;cends to &s;ome mean, unbecoming epithets. His paltry, becau&s;e ill-grounded panegyric upon the con&s;pirators, leads her to a directly full and po|&s;itive charge again&s;t Renault, which &s;hudders Jaffier, though we really cannot find the amorous old gentleman &s;o much to blame; he received, upon very odd terms, a woman who had been lodged in a brothel by her hu&s;band; it was not a very unnatural &s;uppo&s;ition that a lady &s;o circum|&s;tanced might be adapted to his purpo&s;e; never|thele&s;s, upon hearing his attack, Jaffier, who having acted as fool or knave, or both, now de|termines to play the madman, breaths the &s;pirit of revenge, from which Belvidera &s;eems to draw
<PB N="324" REF="340">
&s;ome comfort; her affectionate departure and re|petition of Remember twelve, plea&s;e much.</P>
<P>When Pierre approaches, he rallies his friend as being uxorious, in the following pa&s;&s;age:
<Q>Hunt a wife on the dull <HI>foil.</HI></Q>
We have often &s;een it printed, and &s;ometimes heard it &s;poke <HI>&s;oil,</HI> but the change is totally ab&s;urd, and breaks the allu&s;ion, which evidently points to the chace: that Jaffier &s;hould reveal to his friend as an object of &s;trict confidence what he has ju&s;t heard from his wife is probable, but that any author &s;hould have the a&s;&s;urance to affront an audience with &s;uch gro&s;s &s;tuff, &s;uch ful&s;ome de&s;cription as we find in this &s;hort &s;cene is &s;urpri&s;ing: it &s;hould be much &s;oftened, or much curtailed.</P>
<P>Pierre's de&s;ire of having the matter re&s;t for &s;ome-time is prudent, and Jaffier's con&s;ent to bear the wrong for the pre&s;ent, commendably reluctant; Renault's entrance produces, as might well be ex|pected, a &s;erio-comic encounter, which &s;eems ju&s;t kindling to a flame, when the con&s;pirators entering, put a &s;top to the matter.</P>
<P>During Renault's charge, which is delivered with politic energy, Jaffier manife&s;ts that di&s;like to his a&s;|&s;ociates and their mea&s;ures, which the inva&s;ion of his wife's virtue has created; he who a &s;mall time &s;ince &s;eemed to triumph in a general effu&s;ion of blood, now calls Renault a horrid &s;lave for uttering &s;uch &s;anguinary orders, and &s;links away from the conclu|&s;ive meeting in a very &s;trange manner. Renault, who wi&s;hes him dead, on account of his wife, im|mediately pronounces him an object of &s;u&s;picion and
<PB N="325" REF="341">
danger; this alarms the generous feelings of Pierre's friend&s;hip, who a&s;&s;erts his merit, and mentions the circum&s;tance of Belvidera; much heat en&s;ues, ge|neral de&s;truction to their &s;cheme and lives &s;eems impending, when Renault's peevi&s;h retreat, and a mighty odd conce&s;&s;ion of the other con&s;pirators, re&s;tores harmony.</P>
<P>Pierre &s;hews to con&s;iderable advantage in this &s;cene, as being a rogue of &s;ome principle, but the triplet with which he concludes the act, is truly lamentable.</P>
<P>By what pa&s;&s;es in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act we perceive, that Belvidera has influenced Jaffier to di&s;cover the con&s;piracy; which, though a breach of faith &s;he paints, and with &s;ome ju&s;tice, in a virtuous light; for mo&s;t certain it is, that moral and &s;ocial hone&s;ty directs us rather to break than ob&s;cure an engagement of evil tendency; the anxious &s;u&s;pence of his mind is very natural, till removed by the mention of Renault's attack upon his wife's virtue; her picture of the impending dangers is drawing in &s;triking colours, and her per&s;ua&s;ion determines Jaffier; however, the author, to &s;often his breach of faith, by making it in &s;ome mea&s;ure an act of nece&s;&s;ity, introduces an officer, who takes him pri&s;oner, in con&s;equence of an order from the &s;enate, by him they are conducted off.</P>
<P>The Duke and &s;enators in council appear next; to whom Priuli gives a general intimation of &s;urround|ing perils; his information comes, he &s;ays, from un|known hands; this takes &s;ome blame from Jaffier
<PB N="326" REF="342">
al&s;o; when introduced, he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the court with that bluntne&s;s which a mind agitated like his might well &s;ugge&s;t; and his contempt of their threats &s;hew commendable &s;pirit; by the book it appears, that he has brought a written li&s;t of his friends which we have al&s;o &s;een performers produce, on fir&s;t mentioning the matter; this is improper, for we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that when &s;uch an ample di&s;covery is in their view, and may be &s;eized by force, that the &s;enators would put them&s;elves un|der the obligation of an oath; wherefore Jaffier in&s;tead of &s;hewing a li&s;t when he utters the&s;e words "who&s;e names are here inrolled"&mdash;&s;hould at the word <HI>here</HI> clap his hand on his brea&s;t&mdash;by which the &s;enate may be led to think the &s;ecret lies beyond their reach, except through his voluntary confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though Antonio's &s;peeches in this &s;cene are ludi|crou&s;ly impertinent, yet they occa&s;ion a fine &s;arca&s;m upon authority, which, in&s;tead of maintaining impar|tial ju&s;tice, meanly bends to indulge vicious great|ne&s;s; we mean where the Duke orders Aquilina's hou&s;e, as &s;he is a &s;enator's mi&s;tre&s;s, to be <HI>&s;earched</HI> with <HI>decency.</HI></P>
<P>Jaffier's compunction for what he has done, car|ries on his character with uniformity; upon his be|ing ordered off, Pierre, and the other con&s;pirators appear in cu&s;tody, which cannot proceed from Jaf|fier's information, which has been only ju&s;t deliver|ed in; &s;o that though he may be &s;aid to confirm their crimination, yet he is not the original cau&s;e of their ruin: Pierre's addre&s;s is &s;pecious and &s;pirited,
<PB N="327" REF="343">
he wears his chains with an admirable grace, and by a kind of popular &s;ophi&s;try, turns ignominy into ornament.</P>
<P>Nothing was ever better imagined for action than confronting the friends; Pierre's cordial undi&s;gui&s;ed addre&s;s, upon &s;eeing Jaffier in cu&s;tody, dimini&s;hes the latter greatly, he le&s;&s;ens in our view, and by the confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, becomes contemptible; while the other rogues, by an unbending &s;pirit of per&s;everance claim &s;ome allowance of pity and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>After the court breaks up, Jaffier and Pierre are judiciou&s;ly left to a conference, wherein we find them contra&s;ted in a ma&s;terly manner; con&s;cious guilt cloaths one with contrite &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, deeply pro|voked re&s;entment warms the other to violent di&s;|dain; each is &s;u&s;tained with the genius of ability, and we are alternately prejudiced in favour of both. Jaffier's great and tender anxiety for the life of his friend, is amiable; and Pierre's generous contempt of an exi&s;tence under the burthen of di&s;grace, is truly noble; nor can we deem his pa&s;&s;ion rigorous, when ea&s;ting a&s;ide all Jaffier's conce&s;&s;ions, he &s;wears never to hold friendly intercour&s;e with him again.</P>
<P>Every &s;pectator, or reader, who is acquainted with the human mind, who can &s;ee and forgive the failings of a fellow-creature, plunged amid&s;t inextricable toils of perplexity, mu&s;t here &s;ympathize in the per|turbation of Jaffier, who is now wrought up to look upon his beloved and loving wife, as the great &s;ource of his mo&s;t pungent mi&s;ery: the conflict between love, honour, and injured friend&s;hip, ri&s;es to the
<PB N="328" REF="344">
borders of di&s;traction, when Belvidera appears, who, con&s;cious of the dagger &s;he has planted in her hu&s;|band's heart, fears to &s;ee him, yet has no other guardian, no &s;helter but his love that &s;he can fly to; in this lamentable &s;tate they approach each other, when Jaffier gives a pitiable relation of the rough treatment, the opprobrious terms he has received, which draws from Belvidera an aggravating account of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon Pierre; this works upon Jaffier in a powerful manner, and his pa&s;&s;ion gathers like tho&s;e hurricanes which lie &s;ometime embodied in a gloomy cloud, before they ru&s;h forth with irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity; vengeance points a &s;an|guine dagger towards the unhappy Belvidera, the affectionate hu&s;band wi&s;hes her away, yet re&s;olves upon a &s;acrifice, and even aims the fatal blow, till beautifully di&s;armed by the melting embraces of the woman, who apparently rules, amid&s;t the ut|mo&s;t turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion, his captivated, amorous heart.</P>
<P>This turn of the &s;cene has a very plea&s;ing and forcible effect, it &s;eldom fails to draw from &s;en&s;i|bility tears of joy, and deputing Belvidera as a mediatrix to intercede with her father for his friends, leaves an audience in agreeable &s;u&s;pence at the end of the fourth act.</P>
<P>Priuli opens the fifth act with reflecting on his own painful &s;ituation; by his &s;oliloquy, it appears, that family pride is the foundation of unnatural be|haviour to his unhappy daughter; what the author meant by putting on a veil to ob&s;cure Belvidera we know not, but &s;he approaches her father &s;hrouded
<PB N="329" REF="345">
in one, and addre&s;&s;es him for &s;ome time as a &s;up|pliant unknown; when di&s;covered, the &s;ight of her works parental feelings in the old man's brea&s;t, which &s;he improves by reminding him of the like|ne&s;s &s;he bears to her mother; mention of her hu&s;|band, however, calls forth a &s;tart of re&s;entment; but it &s;oon pa&s;&s;es off, when &s;he relates the danger her life is in; her &s;tory is told with great per&s;ua|&s;ion, and operates &s;ucce&s;sfully to the point &s;he has in view; Priuli relents with unlimited tender|ne&s;s, and promi&s;es to &s;ave the con&s;pirators; there is a pretty tender conce&s;&s;ion at the clo&s;e of the &s;cene, in the father's acknowledging his pa&s;t har&s;hne&s;s, and promi&s;ing future protection.</P>
<P>Aquilina and Antonio, as to what they &s;ay, here intervene again very ab&s;urdly; however, &s;omething is certainly wanting to prevent Jaffier's immediate entrance upon the departure of his wife and father-in-law, as examination of what follows will plainly evince: his &s;oliloquy borders too much upon the bedlamite &s;train, and carries pre&s;umptuous horror with it; admitting pungent di&s;tre&s;s capable of &s;uch execrations, it is a natural extremity which &s;hould not be given to the public ear; on Belvidera's approach, overjoyed we may pre&s;ume with what &s;he &s;uppo&s;es agreeable tidings, Jaffier turns from her, and immediately mentions that Priuli's mercy exerted it&s;elf too late; this is the circum&s;tance which calls for a &s;eparation of the fir&s;t &s;cene from this, for if Jaffier ap|pears the very in&s;tant that Priuli goes off the &s;tage, how can he know that he has promi&s;ed
<PB N="330" REF="346">
to &s;ave the con&s;pirators; or how is there time for Priuli's making the trial, which, according to the following line he has done, though un|&s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<Q>Thy father's ill-tim'd mercy came too late.</Q>
<P>To remove this incon&s;i&s;tence, which we cannot blame the author for, as he wrote an intervening &s;cene, which gave time for Jaffier to be acquainted with the matter, we would recommend an alteration of the pa&s;&s;age to &s;uch gentlemen as hereafter repre|&s;ent the character, to the following or &s;imilar effect:
<Q><L>Thy father's mercy, &s;hould he now relent,</L>
<L>Would come too late&mdash;the doom is fix'd</L>
<L>Of all my poor, betray'd, unhappy friends;</L>
<L>They are &s;ummon'd to prepare for fate's black hour,</L>
<L>Yet I &s;till live.</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;hock of this information cau&s;es Belvidera to court fate even from a hu&s;band's hands, which &s;he does &s;o much in the melting manner, that his di|&s;traction &s;oftens into &s;ympathetic tears, and the &s;cene becomes inexpre&s;&s;ibly pathetic, e&s;pecially where he pronounces a ble&s;&s;ing on his unhappy wife; and &s;he, &s;tung with the thoughts of parting, parodys it into a cur&s;e: mention of their tender infant carries grief to its utmo&s;t extent, and the final &s;eparation of this wretched couple, engro&s;&s;es all the tendere&s;t feelings of humanity.</P>
<P>Belvidera's &s;oliloquy, we think, would be better omitted; as it runs into a &s;train of bomba&s;tic mad|ne&s;s, not properly deducible from, or &s;uited to her &s;ituation; what &s;he &s;peaks al&s;o when her father
<PB N="331" REF="347">
enters is contemptible, and truly de&s;erves GAY's burle&s;que, which, though we are not fond of burle&s;que in general, we think de&s;erves no|tice here.
<Q><L>Murmuring &s;treams, &s;oft &s;hades, and &s;pringing flowers,</L>
<L>Lutes, laurels, &s;eas of milk, and &s;hips of amber,</L></Q>
are thus laughably ridiculed by Kitty Carrot, in the What d'ye call it:
<Q><L>Bagpipes in butter, flocks in fleecy mountains,</L>
<L>Churns, &s;heep-hooks, &s;eas of milk, and honey foun|tains.</L></Q></P>
<P>We now encounter Pierre at the place of execu|tion, where, as the author has wrote the part, he expre&s;&s;es &s;ome di&s;re&s;pectful ideas of religious pre|paration for death; the&s;e &s;peeches, which OTWAY certainly wrote to flatter a licentious age, are com|mendably omitted in repre&s;entation, for there are too many per&s;ons ready to &s;light &s;acred in&s;titu|tions, without the countenance and information of dramatic poets.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of what we thus object to, Pierre's de|portment is gallant and prai&s;e-worthy; Jaffier, on whom &s;orrow has impre&s;&s;ed her deepe&s;t &s;eal to mark him as her own, comes to take a final leave of that friend, who as he thinks, has been wholly brought to infamy and death by his ungrateful breach of con|fidence; the pungent contrition of one character, and the generous forgivene&s;s, nay, tender conde&s;cen|&s;ion of the other, are mo&s;t intere&s;tingly mingled: we wi&s;h Jaffier's propo&s;ition of killing not only his wife but infant al&s;o did not occur: Pierre's de&s;ire of
<PB N="332" REF="348">
evading an ignominious death is very natural to a brave man, and though as a Chri&s;tian Jaffier has no right to take life, e&s;pecially his own, we can|not &s;ee how a mind &s;o frenzied as his could have acted otherwi&s;e; however, we think our author might have furni&s;hed his piece with a better cata&s;|trophe, as in the proper place &s;hall be pointed out.</P>
<P>Pierre's expiring with a laugh of exultation, is peculiar and well imagined; Jaffier al&s;o concludes characteri&s;tically, with tho&s;e pathetic &s;en&s;ations of conjugal affection which &s;eem to have effected his ruin.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene Belvidera's madne&s;s is much better &s;upported than where it fir&s;t &s;eizes her, as every expre&s;&s;ion points at her hu&s;band. From an invincible antipathy to all embodied gho&s;ts, ex|cept that mo&s;t pardonable one of Hamlet's fa|ther, we think the appearance of Jaffier and his friend would have been more ju&s;tifiable as the effect of imagination, than ri&s;ing through trap-doors with whitened faces and bloody &s;hirts, tho&s;e childi&s;h fine&s;&s;es of the &s;tage. Belvidera's dying &s;o &s;uddenly of di&s;traction, which is rather flighty than raging, &s;eems an exaggeration of phy|&s;ical con&s;equences; however, &s;he terminates an object of that pity, which through every preceding &s;cene, &s;he has &s;o powerfully excited; Priuli's re|&s;olution of retiring from the world is natural, but his &s;peech, and the piece are di&s;graced by a mo&s;t mi&s;erable concluding couplet.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved, that the cata&s;trophe of this play might have been thrown into a better form, though
<PB N="333" REF="349">
perhaps not with &s;uch rigid adherence to poetical ju&s;tice. If we con&s;ider that not one character except the Duke, Priuli and the Officer is left alive, VENICE PRESERVED mu&s;t appear a mo&s;t &s;anguine production, a mere theatrical &s;hambles; wherefore, it is apprehended, that if the author, ju&s;t when Jaffier is lifting the dagger, had intro|duced Priuli with a pardon for Pierre, the &s;urprize and change mu&s;t have been very plea&s;ing to an audience; by this the father would have e&s;&s;enti|ally &s;oftened his character, the affectionate couple would have been made happy, and Pierre, the mo&s;t pardonable of the con&s;pirators, would have been &s;aved to &s;erve the &s;tate, which evil connec|tions had urged him to de&s;troy. The &s;enators al&s;o would have been partly relieved from the po&s;itive and general charge of perjury, which now lies again&s;t them for the breach of their conditional oath, &s;o &s;olemnly given to Jaffier.</P>
<P>Among fifteen male per&s;onages in this play, not one moral character appears&mdash;What an unfavoura|ble picture of human nature! calculated to make us hate, not only a part, but the whole of our &s;pe|cies; out of &s;o large a number there are but four of any acting merit, tho&s;e only we &s;hall con&s;ider, the others being under-engines of the plot.</P>
<P>Jaffier is weak, irre&s;olute, ra&s;h, affectionate, cruel, friendly, treacherous; an unnatural compound of &s;uch contrarieties as never were jumbled in the heart of man; yet he is introduced under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, and is furni&s;hed with &s;o many fine pa&s;&s;ages for capital utterance, that we know but few parts in
<PB N="334" REF="350">
which a fir&s;t rate actor can more deeply engage the attention and applau&s;e of an audience.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. GARRICK and BARRY had &s;uch an equa|lity of merit in the repre&s;entation of Jaffier, that to place either fir&s;t would rather be partial, and to draw a fair parallel requires the nice&s;t equilibre of critici&s;m, as they have &s;everally made us feel, &s;o we &s;hall pre&s;ent them to the public, and hope &s;uch great originals may not &s;uffer from our inadequate painting. In the fir&s;t &s;cene Mr. BARRY's appear|ance &s;trikes particularly, his externals &s;trongly apologize for Belvidera's attachment, exclu&s;ive of gratitude for &s;aving her life; when he de&s;cribes plunging after her into the Adriatic, there is a &s;cope, an expan&s;ion of figure, which fills the idea conveyed in this pa&s;&s;age
<Q><L>Like a rich conque&s;t in one hand I bore her,</L>
<L>And with the other da&s;h'd tho&s;e &s;aucy waves,</L>
<L>Which throng'd and pre&s;s'd to rob me of my prize.</L></Q></P>
<P>Indeed, through the whole fir&s;t act, and the fir&s;t &s;cene of the &s;econd, this gentleman could not be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed; but, where Belvidera is delivered to the con&s;pirators, we mu&s;t give Mr. GARRICK con&s;ide|rable preference, for looks mo&s;t powerfully expre&s;|&s;ive, and piercing notes of expre&s;&s;ion. In the fir&s;t &s;cene of the third act equality again took place; the &s;hort &s;ub&s;equent interviews with Pierre and Renault were manife&s;tly on Mr. GARRICK's &s;ide, who&s;e me|rit has cau&s;ed us to lament, that what the author has written &s;o cen&s;urably, &s;hould be rendered &s;o agree|able in action. Before the &s;enate, and through the following &s;cene we mu&s;t al&s;o place him fir&s;t,
<PB N="335" REF="351">
from a &s;uperior &s;ignificance of feature to expre&s;s violent agitation of mind. Upon Belvidera's en|trance Mr. BARRY mu&s;t be admitted to lead, till Belvidera tells him of the torments which are pre|paring for his friends, then Mr. GARRICK &s;teps forward and beggars de&s;cription, by an amazing variety of tran&s;itions, tones, and picture&s;que atti|tudes; the di&s;tracted confu&s;ion which flames in his countenance, and the gleams of love which &s;hed momentary &s;oftne&s;s on the &s;tern glow of rage, exhibit more complicated beauties than any other piece of theatrical execution we have &s;een. In the la&s;t &s;peech of the fourth act, Mr. BARRY was peculiarly happy. Through the whole fifth act, we mu&s;t lean to Mr. GARRICK, who&s;e peculiar ex|cellence in breaks and half lines is univer&s;ally ac|knowledged, and of &s;uch Jaffier is in this act chiefly made up. If gho&s;ts mu&s;t appear, we &s;hall acknowledge Mr. BARRY the mo&s;t &s;triking we have &s;een.</P>
<P>Mr. RYAN was deemed very re&s;pectable in this character, yet, exclu&s;ive of the la&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act, where we admit his merit, he neither &s;poke nor looked in our remembrance characteri&s;ti|cally.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. POWELL and ROSS were as near a parallel as the two great competitors above mentioned, the one de&s;erved prai&s;e for tender, the other for amorous expre&s;&s;ion; however, neither could reach the violent pa&s;&s;ions of Jaffier by many degrees, want of power prevented the former, and neg|ligence or dullne&s;s of feeling the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="352">Pierre de&s;cribes him&s;elf as a fine, gay, bold-faced villain, and a villain he truly is, labouring for the de&s;truction of his native country, on the mo&s;t paltry pretence of provocation, no other than being ri|valled in a favourite courtezan, yet he has the a&s;&s;urance to talk of liberty; indeed, from the picture OTWAY has drawn of this con&s;piracy, he &s;eems to have had a political view, which was to throw an odium on all tho&s;e who had re&s;i&s;ted the FIRST CHARLES's mea&s;ures, and tho&s;e who had &s;pirit enough to complain of his &s;on's proceedings. A courtly poet, and that OTWAY was &s;uch, vide his mean, &s;ycophantic dedication, will ever &s;hew popular &s;pirit in an unfavourable light; nothing could tend more to this than making the con|&s;pirators a &s;et of complete de&s;perate &s;coundrels. As a proof of our &s;ugge&s;tion, we refer to the Epilogue, and if &s;uch be the tendency of the piece, it is unworthy countenance in a free &s;tate.</P>
<P>When three of the following names are peru&s;ed, it will po&s;&s;ibly appear &s;trange, that we venture to place Mr. SHERIDAN foremo&s;t in Pierre, but as we either have, or ought to have pronounced his judg|ment at lea&s;t upon an equality to that of any per|former within our knowledge; as in this part his powers operate more happily than in any other of equal fire; as in the de&s;criptive, the per&s;ua&s;ive, and the di&s;dainful parts; the vindication, the reproach, and the forgivene&s;s of Jaffier, he was equally excellent; it is but ju&s;t to give him pre|cedence of tho&s;e competitors who &s;truck out only a few occa&s;ional beauties, though perhaps in them particular places &s;uperior to him.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="353">Mr. MOSSOP has the capability of excellence, but having either an erring or laborious judgment, mi&s;applies his talents gro&s;sly; in the two fir&s;t acts, where open, genteel, generous freedom is required, he toils through a &s;trained in&s;ipidity of expre&s;&s;ion: in the third, where Jaffier's hone&s;ty is impeached, he totally lo&s;es the gentleman, and bullies the con|&s;pirators like a bravo; there is a delicacy even in the rapidity of pa&s;&s;ion, which he &s;eems unacquainted with. Before the &s;enate, and in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;cene with Jaffier, his natural contemptuous a&s;pect, and his uncommon extent of voice operate happily; but, in the fifth act, he forgives his friend with a countenance as if he was going to knock him down.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY was a very agreeable, but, in the critical view, indefen&s;ible Pierre; a mellifluous flow of expre&s;&s;ion, and harmonious con&s;onance of features, much better &s;uited to Jaffier, le&s;&s;ened an e&s;&s;ential contra&s;t, and rather contradicted the idea we have of this bold militarian; the eye and ear, however, were plea&s;ed, while judgment &s;at covered with a reluctant frown.</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN, who was by many e&s;teemed a &s;tand|ard of perfection, rolled mo&s;t heavily through the part; he recitatived the calmer, and bellowed the more &s;pirited &s;cenes; in the line
<Q>I could have hugg'd the grea&s;y rogues, they pleas'd me;</Q>
his execration of the &s;enate, and a few pa&s;&s;ages in the dying &s;cene, he was very fortunate, but through all the re&s;t much more like a heavy-headed, me|thodical,
<PB N="338" REF="354">
&s;aturnine pedagogue, than what the author meant.</P>
<P>Mr. BENSLEY is as formal, though not &s;o im|portant as the la&s;t mentioned gentleman, and aims much more at lavi&s;hed applau&s;e than critical pro|prietry, forgetting this indi&s;putable truth in public life, that he who mode&s;tly &s;teals through an ar|duous undertaking, is much more commendable than the per&s;on who confidently expo&s;es inadequate abilities, and endeavours to pa&s;s them current by the &s;tamp of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>Mr. HOLLAND, in the character of Pierre, gave evident marks of the &s;chool where he originally &s;tudied acting, we mean the &s;pouting-club, &s;tiff without dignity, and &s;onorous without meaning, totally void of originality, mounted and hobbling on the aukward &s;tilts of imitation. Mr. AICKIN, in a mode&s;t prologue, lately placed him&s;elf beneath this gentleman, but he need not have paid his abilities &s;o bad a compliment.</P>
<P>Renault was admirably &s;upported by Mr. SPARKS, who &s;hewed &s;omething in the repre&s;entation of him that we have never &s;een hit off by any performer but him&s;elf; in giving the charge, in profe&s;&s;ing &s;yco|phantic friend&s;hip for Jaffier, and in the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by Pierre's reproaches, he far out&s;tripped all competition. Mr. BURTON gets through him without de&s;erving prai&s;e, yet does not incur cen&s;ure. If the part was about half as long again, there would be danger of his &s;etting an audience a&s;leep, but, as as it is, he pa&s;&s;es off an inoffen&s;ive relief to atten|tion.
<PB N="339" REF="355">
We appehend Renault to be more in Mr. GIBSON's compa&s;s, than any other tragedy part whatever.</P>
<P>Mr. HAVARD was as plea&s;ing in Priuli as the part would admit; nor was Mr. RIDOUT void of con&s;iderable merit. Mr. BANNISTER, at pre&s;ent, &s;u&s;tains it with ability at Drury Lane, and Mr. HULL &s;hould re&s;cue it from le&s;s able talents at Co|vent Garden.</P>
<P>Belvidera is an amiable, con&s;i&s;tent character, con&s;tant and rational in affection, &s;uperior to the frowns of poverty, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of quick and de|licate &s;en&s;ibility; &s;he towers above misfortunes, while they affect circum&s;tances only, but natural|ly &s;inks under an accumulation of unhappy effects wrought by them.</P>
<P>Mrs. CIBBER and Mrs. BELLAMY, had each &s;ingular merit in this part; however, the former, who had a countenance mo&s;t exqui&s;itely formed to expre&s;s angui&s;h and di&s;traction, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed her competitor in tho&s;e &s;cenes where deep and violent feelings occur, while the latter, from an amorous glow of features and utterance, excelled in the pa&s;&s;ages relative to conjugal affection; her de|&s;cription of the madne&s;s, &s;uch as it is, was prefe|rable to Mrs. CIBBER's, becau&s;e more di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>Mrs. BARRY treads clo&s;e on the heels of the two ladies mentioned, and, if not &s;o &s;trikingly con&s;picu|ous in particular places as either, &s;he is more equal through the whole than both; what her counte|nance wants of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;he makes up in a con|&s;iderable &s;uperiority of figure, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
<PB N="340" REF="356">
more amiable dignity of appearance than any thea|trical lady we remember.</P>
<P>To &s;um up our opinion of this tragedy, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that OTWAY &s;eems to have had little el&s;e in view than catching the pa&s;&s;ions at any rate, which mo&s;t certainly he has effected; breaches of decorum and delicacy were no objects of his caution, he wrote to the heart without properly remembering the head, wherefore, his plot, though tolerably re|gular, will, we apprehend, from what has been ob&s;erved, appear defective. His language is free, and his ver&s;ification flowing, but the latter is not al|ways correct, nor the former cha&s;te; his &s;entiments are lively and pathetic, but in many places &s;trained, and in more licentious. As to his characters, we cannot offer a better general critici&s;m than that of Mr. ADDISON, who writes in one of the Spectators as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The greate&s;t characters in VENICE PRESERVED are tho&s;e of rebels and traitors; had the hero of this play di&s;covered the &s;ame good qualities in defence of his country, that he &s;hews for its ruin and &s;ubver|&s;ion, the audience could not enough pity and ad|mire him; but, as he is now repre&s;ented, we can only &s;ay of him, what the Roman hi&s;torian &s;ays of Cataline, that his fall would have been glorious, <HI>&s;i pro patria &s;ic concidi&s;&s;et,</HI> had he &s;o fallen in the &s;ervice of his country."</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE MINOR. A COMEDY by Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of this piece has always been al|lowed a plea&s;ing peculiarity in his dramatic wri|tings; they evidently di&s;cover that excellent defini|tion of wit, a quick conception and an ea&s;y deli|very. The comedy now before us, was u&s;hered ori|ginally into public view by a prelu&s;ive &s;cene be|tween Mr. FOOTE, in his private capacity, and two bucki&s;h critics of his acquaintance. In the fir&s;t part of their di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ome very &s;en&s;ible and &s;pirited remarks on tho&s;e objects mo&s;t proper for ridicule occur. We may di&s;cover that a charge of too much per&s;onality in his &s;atire, led the author into this able defence of him&s;elf; it being al&s;o a tick|li&s;h point, to expo&s;e even mo&s;t egregious and prejudicial enthu&s;ia&s;m on the &s;tage; he prepared the audience for what they were to expect, and has in the following pa&s;&s;age, beyond confutation, ju&s;tified his de&s;ign; not only as free from cen|&s;ure, but as worthy national countenance and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Speaking of that burle&s;que upon religion and common &s;en&s;e, Methodi&s;m, he &s;ays emphatically, "This is madne&s;s, which argument can never cure; and &s;hould a little whole&s;ome &s;everity be applied, per&s;ecution would be the immediate cry: Where then can we have recour&s;e, but to the comic mu&s;e? Perhaps the archne&s;s and &s;everity of her &s;mile may

redre&s;s an evil that the laws cannot reach, or rea|&s;on reclaim."</P>
<P>Sir William Wealthy and his brother Richard, open the fir&s;t act. A difference of opinion relative to education, is the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation; the baronet is lectured with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of good &s;en&s;e by the Merchant, for giving his &s;on a fa&s;hionable education; and he judiciou&s;ly retorts upon the cit, tho&s;e prejudices which ari&s;e from contracted ideas and a defective knowledge of life. From the latter part of this &s;cene we find, that one is a liberal, the other a rigid father; that Sir William has tenderly laid a &s;cheme for the refor|mation of his &s;on, while Richard has di&s;carded a daughter for &s;ome trifling tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Capias, the attorney's letter, is humorou&s;ly cha|racteri&s;tic; and Shift, who is recommended as a proper agent for Sir William's de&s;ign, gives, in his conver&s;ation with that gentleman, a mo&s;t ludicrous account of his birth, parentage, and education; the picture of his progre&s;s through life, is in the true Hogarth &s;tile of dramatic painting; and the ludicrous account of his own abilities, makes Sir William lay open his de&s;ign for the reformation of his di&s;&s;ipated heir; a de&s;ign commendably laid; as &s;evere feelings of tho&s;e ill con&s;equences which gaming in particular produces, are mo&s;t likely to work a change of con|duct in thoughtle&s;s youth. Shift's readine&s;s to en|ter upon any &s;ervice for his own emolument, and the de&s;ign expre&s;&s;ed in his &s;oliloquy, of &s;ticking to the mo&s;t profitable party, fulfil the idea furni&s;hed by his name.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="359">The Minor, and one of his gambling friends ap|pear next. The former di&s;plays elevated notions of fa&s;hion, elegance and fal&s;e honour; the latter expre&s;|&s;es him&s;elf happily in a kind of knowing cant. The intimation of Mrs. Cole's having called, is a good preparative for her appearance, and &s;ome poignant &s;trokes upon her hypocritical connection are thrown out. Sir William entering as the baron gives a new turn to conver&s;ation, and &s;hews the &s;on in a fre&s;h view of vicious prodigality; that of taking an Italian opera-&s;inger into keeping upon mo&s;t extravagant terms, which he deems moderate: A mo&s;t excellent &s;troke of keen &s;atire occurs from the Minor's ob&s;ervation, that he only knows her to be a hand&s;ome woman by report, again&s;t tho&s;e children of fa&s;hionable profu&s;ion, who expend large &s;ums for unenjoyed &s;urperfluities. Upon Loader's going off to conduct Mrs. Cole, the young Gentleman lets fall a remark which we apprehend, many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction might ju&s;tly apply to them&s;elves: "To &s;ay truth, I am &s;incerely &s;ick of my acquaintance; but, however, I have the fir&s;t people of the kingdom to keep me in countenance; death and the dice level all di&s;tinctions."</P>
<P>Never was a better picture drawn of debauched enthu&s;ia&s;m, than pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the old bawd, who&s;e whole conver&s;ation exhibits a natural, laugh|able jumble of affected &s;anctity and real vice; the con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s &s;he boa&s;ts in her infamous profe&s;|&s;ion, of not tipping Sir Timothy Totter, an old trader, is admirably &s;ugge&s;ted; and adverti&s;ing in
<PB N="344" REF="360">
the regi&s;ter-office, to decoy young girls into a &s;tate of pro&s;titution, is well levelled again&s;t places where, we doubt not, mo&s;t &s;ini&s;ter practices have been carried on, to the ruin of many an un&s;u&s;pect|ing female; this &s;cene mu&s;t afford real entertainment to all ages, and con&s;iderable in&s;truction to the younger part of an audience, upon whom externals frequently make prejudicial impre&s;&s;ions. What Sir George &s;ays of the new-birth teachers, well de&s;erves quotation: "No wonder the&s;e preachers have plenty of pro&s;elytes, while they have the ad|dre&s;s &s;o comfortably to blend the hitherto jarring intere&s;ts of the two worlds."</P>
<P>At the commencement of the &s;econd act, our Minor and Transfer, a money jobber, meet for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing &s;ome ca&s;h for Sir George's pre|&s;ent occa&s;ions. In this &s;cene the u&s;urer is &s;upported much in character, the difficulties he relates of meet|ing any ready money, the expedient he propo&s;es of furni&s;hing &s;ome goods, are in the true u&s;urious &s;train; the young baronet's re&s;entment of &s;uch a &s;trange, and to him unintelligible propo&s;ition, is natural; and Loader's interpo&s;ition when Transfer di&s;appears, plainly manife&s;ts the blood-&s;ucking gambler, who, having got a pigeon, determines to unfeather him at any rate. Upon Transfer's &s;econd appearance, the precipitation of prodigal youth into any terms that may &s;upply its cravings, and the rapacious advantages taken of it by avaricious knaves, are &s;et forth in a ma&s;terly manner; Loader al&s;o is con|&s;picuous for &s;o readily giving away what is not his own.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="361">Richard Wealthy comes to expo&s;tulate with his nephew upon the life he leads, and &s;ays &s;ome very rational things. His remark upon what are u&s;ual|ly called debts of honour, is pregnant with u&s;eful truth. "Here's a pro&s;titution of words&mdash;Ho|nour! &mdash;'Sdeath, that a ra&s;cal who has picked your pocket, &s;hall have his crime gilded with the mo&s;t &s;acred di&s;tinction, and his plunder punctually paid, while the indu&s;trious mechanic, who mini|&s;ters to your very wants, &s;hall have his debts de|layed, and his demand treated as in&s;olent."</P>
<P>The Minor, however, deaf to rea&s;on, treats his uncle's advice with levity, which occa&s;ions the latter to &s;tart another topic relative to a propo&s;ed marriage with his daughter; by the by, he calls her an only daughter, though we find by the piece he has three, Lucy, whom he has turned out of his hou&s;e, Charlotte, whom he mentions in the fir&s;t &s;cene, and Margery, named by Sir George in this. This, however, is not a very material &s;lip&mdash;The young gentleman's behaviour on men|tion of the march, &s;hews the taint he has received of family pride, and the conver&s;ation is plea&s;antly conducted, till the cit rou&s;es into a commendable feeling of the light treatment he has met, and utters &s;ome very home truths.</P>
<P>The Baron's behaviour on hearing a &s;oap-boiler mentioned as Sir George's ance&s;tor, is in the true &s;tile of Germanic pride, which is idle and imperti|nent enough to value antiquity of de&s;cent more than per&s;onal merit. By Mr. Loader's a&s;&s;iduity to rai&s;e ca&s;h, we have Shift introduced as an auctioneer,
<PB N="346" REF="362">
named Smirk, from him we collect &s;everal &s;trokes of &s;terling humour; his relation of the accident which occa&s;ioned him to &s;ucceed Mr. Prig, is a fund of mirth, and his debate about what wig to wear in his public capacity, appeals &s;trongly to laughter. There is not perhaps a greater degree of impo&s;i|tion than at auctions, e&s;pecially the middle &s;ort, and it is to be wi&s;hed, that our author had en|larged more upon the folly of numbers who fre|quent &s;uch places, and the knavery of a great majority of &s;uch as conduct them; however, he &s;eems to have aimed at a little more than expo&s;ing the coxcombly in&s;ignificance of a particular well known per&s;on.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, we find our Minor has embarra&s;&s;ed his circum&s;tances mo&s;t vio|lently; however, his reflection is interrupted by Mrs. Cole's introduction of a young female, as a mi&s;tre&s;s for Sir George: his fir&s;t approaches to the lady &s;a|vour of the rake, but upon her pathetic addre&s;s, he indulges her with patient, generous, humane atten|tion; &s;he relates her artle&s;s, yet affecting tale, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;he works an intended in&s;trument of her ruin into a kind and di&s;intere&s;ted protector; this &s;cene not only rai&s;es tender &s;en&s;ations, but al&s;o a curio&s;ity in &s;pectators to know more of Lucy than &s;he chu&s;es to di&s;cover; it gives us mo&s;t amiable impre&s;&s;ions of Sir George, who appears not to be vicious for want of virtue, but for want of reflection and prudence; and it &s;tands an inconte&s;tible proof that our author's genius, though the parent of &s;miles, can produce matter of a &s;erious and important na|ture,
<PB N="347" REF="363">
with a glow of expre&s;&s;ion equal to that which cloaths the lighter and more &s;pirited parts of his compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Sir William Wealthy and his brother Richard now appear, &s;ignifying, that matters are brought to a cata&s;trophe; Shift acquaints them, that the Minor has di&s;covered Loader and another game|&s;ter in the act of fraud; upon his words the two worthy di&s;ciples of cinque and quatre are driven in with keen reproaches and deep threats; Sir William is attacked too as the Baron by his en|raged &s;on, and pious Mrs. Cole meets as &s;evere a rebuff in her turn; con&s;tables being introduced, Sir William is nece&s;&s;itated to di&s;cover him&s;elf; upon being proved his father, the young gentle|man acknowledges him with dutiful affection; the game&s;ters, through Sir William's connection &s;tand convicted, and young Wealthy acknow|ledges him&s;elf in fault, but pleads a &s;trong argu|ment of exculpation, or rather reconciliation which on his going off Shift explains. To render his ge|nerous treatment of the young lady more engag|ing, a mo&s;t beautiful incident &s;trikes us in the di&s;covery of her being Mr. Richard Wealthy's bani&s;hed daughter, who has been reduced to &s;uch a perilous &s;tate by her father's rigidity: the cit being convicted of, and repentant for un|ju&s;tifiable behaviour, con&s;ents to make the young couple happy, in a matrimonial union; thus the piece agreeably &s;lides into a termination, upon the &s;tricte&s;t principles of moral and poetical ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="364">The Epilogue, by Shift, is an excellent and plea&s;ant burle&s;que upon the &s;trained, rhap&s;odical, figurative mode of expre&s;&s;ion, adopted by the &s;aints of Tottenham Court and Moorfields, to &s;upply the place of that rea&s;on which nature has denied them, or enjoying, they &s;uppre&s;s for venal, impious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The author at pre&s;ent under con&s;ideration, among many other dramatic excellencies, has one not to be found in the writings of many who enjoy a great &s;hare of public e&s;timation; that is, never incumbering his audience with make-&s;hift, ex|planatory &s;cenes: all his per&s;onages appear to &s;ome plea&s;ing and e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;e; tho&s;e of ten lines &s;peaking as much for the &s;tation they are placed in, as tho&s;e who have a hundred or more to repeat; there are no forced incidents, no la|boured &s;entiments, but a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;cenes, a dependant connection of events, a ju|dicious contra&s;t of characters, a con&s;tant and co|pious &s;upply of keen &s;atire, &s;olid &s;en&s;e, &s;ocial be|nevolence, or plea&s;ant rapartee. Above all, he mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively proves, that the pitiful re&s;our&s;e for humour in CHARLES's days is totally unne|ce&s;&s;ary, where there is real genius to emanate &s;pontaneou&s;ly. Thus much we have thought due to Mr. FOOTE; but as we profe&s;s, neither to prai&s;e nor cen&s;ure without rea&s;on on our &s;ide, let us examine from the view we have ju&s;t had of his MINOR, whether he merits &s;uch approbation or not.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="365">The MINOR conveys a forcible and exten&s;ive moral. The two brothers, as parents, &s;hew that a kind, patient, prudent father, is more likely to work &s;alutary effects for his child, than a rigid, impetuous, and po&s;itive one. From Lucy's hap|py deliverance we may learn, that per&s;evering virtue can di&s;arm vice, and create a protector when lea&s;t expected. By Loader we perceive, that a time of di&s;covery, &s;hame, and puni&s;h|ment, waits upon the mo&s;t plau&s;ible villainy. And Mrs. Cole di&s;covers that hypocri&s;y is at be&s;t a paultry veil, which rather hides the wearer from &s;elf-perception, than from the penetrating glance of rea&s;on's eye; and that enthu&s;ia&s;m is parent of vice, making &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity an at|tonement for the breach of every obligation hu|man and divine.</P>
<P>Young Wealthy, in point of character, is an ea&s;y, &s;en&s;ible, well principled, but di&s;&s;ipated gentleman, capable of di&s;covering his unworthy attachments, but not re&s;olute enough to break through them, till &s;tung to the quick by the ter|rifying frown of impending ruin, and an ab&s;o|lute di&s;covery of fraud. When this comedy was done at Drury-Lane, Mr. HOLLAND repre&s;ented the Minor, but was egregiou&s;ly defective in ea&s;e and vivacity. We have &s;een two or three others, who&s;e names we forget, figure away in it very inadequately. Mr. J. AICKIN, la&s;t &s;ummer, &s;eemed to convey the author's meaning with pro|priety, but wanted an e&s;&s;ential &s;howine&s;s of per|&s;on, and fell rather &s;hort in point of &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="366">Sir William's acting merit, lies intirely in the Baron a&s;&s;umed, which Mr. BADDELY hit off with a very ma&s;terly degree of execution. If Mr. CASTLE does not ri&s;e up to an equality of merit, he yet de&s;erves con&s;iderable approbation. Richard Wealthy was never &s;o well as in the hands of Mr. BURTON, who looked and &s;poke him very re&s;pectably.</P>
<P>Loader, who is the be&s;t drawn game&s;ter we know, &s;at ea&s;y upon Mr. DAVIS, who&s;e conception and expre&s;&s;ion as an actor, &s;eem be&s;t adapted to the characteri&s;tic jargon of this part; there is a kind of ba&s;tard gentility in his deportment, and a becom|ing effrontery of countenance to delineate happily a &s;ix-to-four gentleman. Mr. KEARNY reduced Loader, la&s;t &s;ummer, to &s;uch a prick-in-the-belt, Field-lane &s;harper, that the Minor mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as a fool, to be one moment impo&s;ed on by &s;o legible a knave.</P>
<P>Shift is a part of extreme difficult execution; every line of which tells from Mr. FOOTE's une|qualled rapidity of expre&s;&s;ion. However, Mr. BANNISTER has great merit in his fir&s;t &s;cene; but when he introduces his happy imitations, we are &s;orry to recollect a pa&s;&s;age in the prelu&s;ive &s;cene, which condemns mimicry of performers in very ju&s;t terms. In the Auctioneer, there is a mo&s;t laughable peculiarity &s;truck out by Mr. FOOTE.</P>
<P>Transfer is a well-drawn u&s;urer; he was well re|pre&s;ented by Mr. BLAKES, much better by Mr. WESTON, excellently well by Mr. PARSONS.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="367">Mr. FOOTE's excellence in the tran&s;itions and contra&s;t parts of Mrs. Cole's character is &s;o well, &s;o univer&s;ally known, that we &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe, particularly, that merit which we cannot find words equal to.</P>
<P>Lucy, though a &s;hort character, made a mo&s;t delicate and engaging part of the evening's enter|tainment, when per&s;onated by Mi&s;s PRITCHARD, afterwards Mrs. PALMER: nor does &s;he appear the lea&s;t languid, when repre&s;ented by Mrs. JEFFERIES.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we apprehend, it cannot be deemed an error of judgment, or partial favour, to pronounce this comedy, one of the mo&s;t enter|taining, original, and u&s;eful pieces, now in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>We have &s;een, and with concern, the MINOR lately adverti&s;ed at Drury-Lane in TWO ACTS: it is illiberal to farcify the comedy of a living au|thor, &s;o di&s;tinctly &s;ituated as Mr. FOOTE; and we hope, the managers will never again counte|nance &s;uch unfair theatrical depredation.</P>

<HEAD>KING LEAR. A TRAGEDY. Altered from Shake&s;peare, by Tate and Colman.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;on who enters upon dramatic altera|tion, without being a &s;lave to his original, &s;hould nearly as po&s;&s;ible, confine him&s;elf to pruning luxu|riances, correcting irregularity, rationalizing bom|ba&s;t, and elucidating ob&s;curity; cautious of adding, unle&s;s where unavoidable gaps are made, and con|nection con&s;equently wanting; it is mo&s;t allow|able that SHAKESPEARE'S KING LEAR very much wanted &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as we have mentioned.</P>
<P>TATE's opening of the play we apprehend pre|ferable to that adopted by COLMAN; for the Ba&s;|tard makes us much better, that is much more decently acquainted with his illegitimacy in the &s;oliloquy &s;poken by him, than Glo&s;ter's account; the antipathy he bears to Edgar as &s;tanding before him, is al&s;o well intimated, and Lear's character is properly opened in the &s;hort following &s;cene be|tween Glo&s;ter and Kent, wherein al&s;o the former expre&s;&s;es &s;trong re&s;entment again&s;t his &s;on Edgar, and warm attachment, to Edmund, by who&s;e cunning his pa&s;&s;ion is rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>Where Lear divides his kingdom upon the childi&s;h principle of a&s;king which daughter loves him be&s;t
<PB N="353" REF="369">
COLMAN has pre&s;erved that unju&s;tifiable, cynical roughne&s;s, which SHAKESPEARE has &s;tamped upon Cordelia, in the barren, churli&s;h an&s;wer &s;he gives her father; this TATE has con&s;iderably &s;oftened, by making her attachment to Edgar, the cau&s;e of &s;uch reply: we think, however, that the whole affair might have been thrown into a much better light, by making the old monarch divide his kingdom on the marriage of his daughters, with tho&s;e per&s;ons he approved; Cordelia's refu&s;ing the per&s;on of his choice from a &s;ecret inclination el&s;ewhere, would have re&s;cued him from the ex|treme folly now chargeable again&s;t him, and the &s;ucce&s;sful daughters might have made profe&s;&s;ions equally flattering from a &s;eeming gratitude, as they now do from affected duty; Lear's &s;eeing into, and declaring a knowledge of Cordelia's attach|ment, would have furni&s;hed &s;trong additional rea|&s;on for Edgar's flight; the rough, hone&s;t inter|po&s;ition of Kent, is a circum&s;tance extremely plea&s;ing; in this, as well as many other &s;cenes of the play, TATE has enervated the ver&s;ification, by endeavouring to give it a &s;moother flow; where|fore COLMAN has &s;hewn greater judgment and more mode&s;ty, by only retrenching, not altering the original.</P>
<P>We can by no means agree with the la&s;t-men|tioned gentleman, that the love epi&s;ode of Edgar and Cordelia is &s;uperfluous or unaffecting, we mu&s;t rather contend in oppo&s;ition to the frigidity of cri|ici&s;m, that natural and very plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations are rai&s;ed by it, without any inva&s;ion upon the
<PB N="354" REF="370">
main di&s;tre&s;s of the piece; to enter into a minute defence of this Opinion, is not con&s;i&s;tent with our plan, we only advance it for the reader's con&s;idera|tion and arbitration, appealing to audiences, as Mr. COLMAN in his preface has done, from who&s;e feelings we imagine abundant proofs will ri&s;e in favour of what we thus take upon us to approve.</P>
<P>What Goheril and Regan &s;ay after Lear's depar|ture, is judiciou&s;ly omitted by TATE, as their cha|racters are thereby unnece&s;&s;arily, and too &s;oon laid open; his introducing the Ba&s;tard, in colour of friend&s;hip to Edgar, is al&s;o judicious, and lets us well into the &s;cope of his de&s;ign; the following &s;cene between Glo&s;ter and Edmund, however, he has mutilated abominably, by improper omi&s;&s;ion and pitiful ver&s;ification; the Ba&s;tard's excellent &s;o|liloquy he has &s;trangely mangled; neverthele&s;s, we think, without lo&s;ing any part of the &s;pirit, Mr. COLMAN might have rendered the la&s;t &s;entence of it more delicate.</P>
<P>We can by no means conceive why Kent's fir&s;t &s;peech, when di&s;gui&s;ed, &s;hould have been curtailed; as to the &s;hort preceding &s;cene between Goneril and her &s;teward, we deem it trifling and une&s;&s;ential, as what it relates to needs no &s;uch preparative, there|fore, we commend TATE for leaving it out; but we mu&s;t immediately after cen&s;ure his curtailing what the original author &s;o happily penned for Kent and the King; the introductory pa&s;&s;ages to Gone|ril's ill treatment of her royal father, are much bet|ter in SHAKESPEARE than in either of the alterations.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="371">As a comparative view renders it impracticable to trace the &s;tory in the manner we have done in other pieces, it will, we hope, be deemed allow|able to remind our readers, that after improvi|dently parting with his all, abandoning his only dutiful child, and bani&s;hing his firme&s;t friend, old Lear now pre&s;ents him&s;elf before his elde&s;t daughter, who, on mere pretence of injury, behaves with ungrateful in&s;olence; here the king's natural im|patience is ju&s;tifiably wrought up, even to a bitter and pathetic execration of his undutiful child: though TATE had con&s;iderable merit in his tran&s;|po&s;ition of the la&s;t &s;cene of the fir&s;t act, yet we think Mr. COLMAN has &s;hewn more critical know|ledge of nature and the &s;tage, by re&s;toring &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages which were omitted, and by concluding the act with Lear's cur&s;e, as nothing could be &s;aid after to any effect.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, we find the Ba&s;tard, with mo&s;t villainous hypocri&s;y, carrying on his de&s;ign again&s;t Edgar's life, which Glo&s;ter credulou&s;ly comes into; this &s;cene is much better in COLMAN than TATE, as is the following inter|view, where Kent &s;o characteri&s;tically cathechi&s;es Goneril's in&s;ignificant Gentleman U&s;her.</P>
<P>The Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan appear next, upon a vi&s;it to Glo&s;ter, who&s;e mi&s;fortune in the &s;uppo&s;ed unnatural behaviour of his elde&s;t &s;on, they condole, and offer their authority to puni&s;h the offender; Regan's laying a &s;tre&s;s upon his being an a&s;&s;ociate with her father's riotous knights, as &s;he calls them, is a good opening of her intended behaviour
<PB N="356" REF="372">
to the good old king. Mr. COLMAN objects to making the daughters entertain a criminal pa&s;&s;ion for Edmund, but if we can once &s;uppo&s;e them capable of filial ingratitude, all other vices, as Dr. YOUNG emphatically has it, may &s;eem virtues in them; for this rea&s;on, we approve the intima|tion TATE has furni&s;hed Regan with, of her pre|judice in favour of Edmund. When Kent and the Gentleman U&s;her appear, COLMAN has again judi|ciou&s;ly pre&s;erved &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages which the laureat &s;trangely &s;lipped over, or wretchedly metamor|pho&s;ed: we know not any &s;cene written with more &s;pirit and originality than this; Kent's hone&s;t, &s;ar|ca&s;tical bluntne&s;s, is finely contra&s;ted to the courtly water-fly's &s;upple nothingne&s;s; however, decorum is certainly intruded upon, for &s;uch language to be u&s;ed in pre&s;ence of a joint ruler of the &s;tate, is unpardonable; and we heartily agree that Kent de&s;erves &s;ome puni&s;hment, but much regret &s;o farcical an incident as a pair of moveable &s;tocks, &s;o conveniently placed in a nobleman's ca&s;tle, as to be forth coming on the in&s;tant, Kent's going to &s;leep in &s;uch a &s;ituation is ludicrous al&s;o; we are amazed when alteration was on foot, this incident was not changed for one more probable, and equally conducive to the plot; e&s;pecially when &s;uch a change might be made with the greate&s;t ea&s;e imaginable. We have &s;een the Gentleman U&s;her make a very pantomimical &s;troke, by pu&s;hing at Kent when his legs are fa&s;t; &s;uch a manoeuvre cannot fail of cau&s;ing laughter, but are &s;uch vio|lations of the fine feelings &s;ufferable?</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="373">In Edgar's &s;oliloquy, as altered by TATE, we find that he does not fly his enemies, as in COLMAN, from a paltry fear of the danger which hangs over his per&s;on, but from a generous, laudable motive of waiting an opportunity of &s;erving the woman he loves, and who has made &s;o great a &s;acrifice on his account; for this purpo&s;e he has re&s;olution to put on the wretchede&s;t appearance, and to encounter a &s;ituation wor&s;e than death: this places him in a degree of e&s;timation with the audience, which otherwi&s;e he could not have obtained.</P>
<P>The &s;tocks again pre&s;ent them&s;elves to view, merely as an object of inflammation to the old king, who being already nettled, fires at the treatment his me&s;&s;enger has met, and indeed well he may, not knowing what per&s;onal provocation that me&s;|&s;enger had given; the appearance of Cornwall and Regan brings matters to a pathetic and &s;trik|ing explanation; SHAKESPEARE, in this &s;cene, has particularly &s;ummoned the amazing powers of his genius to exert them&s;elves. The tran&s;itions of Lear are beautiful; from pa&s;&s;ion he falls to conde&s;cen&s;ion and tenderne&s;s, mingled with grief; then flames again, while the two unnatural hags, as he ju&s;tly calls them, alternately &s;tab a dagger in his aged heart.</P>
<P>Mr. COLMAN, by &s;ticking clo&s;er to the original than TATE, has an advantage in this &s;cene, but is in our apprehen&s;ion unpardonable, for omitting the following beautiful thought, &s;ugge&s;ted by SHAKESPEARE, and thus commendably expre&s;&s;ed by TATE.</P>
<Q><PB N="358" REF="374">
<L>The wicked, when compar'd with the more wicked,</L>
<L>Seem beautiful; and not to be the wor&s;t</L>
<L>Stands in &s;ome rank of prai&s;e.</L></Q>
<P>The old man's &s;econd conde&s;cen&s;ion in what immediately follows &s;hould not have been neg|lected, as humanity therefrom feels a very affect|ing &s;en&s;ation;
<Q><L>Now Goneril</L>
<L>Thou art innocent again&mdash;I'll go with thee;</L>
<L>Thy fifty yet does double five and twenty,</L>
<L>And thou art twice her love.</L></Q></P>
<P>Concluding the act with the old king's exit, is &s;o obviou&s;ly right, that we are a&s;toni&s;hed SHAKE|SPEARE &s;hould have added &s;o much phlegmatic &s;tuff as he has done.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, we find un|happy Lear &s;helterle&s;s, &s;truck with phrenzy, wan|dering through a mo&s;t tremendous &s;torm, over a bla&s;ted heath; without friend or con&s;olation but what he finds in old faithful Kent, and the un|hinged &s;tate of his mind, which renders him in|&s;en&s;ible of external injuries, though &s;evere; a number of beautiful, moral &s;entiments adorn his di&s;tracted ideas, particularly where he warns con|cealed guilt to tremble at elementary threatenings, and ju&s;tly makes his own innocence a &s;hield again&s;t fear.</P>
<P>As we have inclined to admit Edmund's intrigue with Goneril and Regan, &s;o we approve his &s;olilo|quy, and the complimentary notices he receives from
<PB N="359" REF="375">
tho&s;e ladies; Glo&s;ter's conference with him con|cerning a mode of relief for the old king, we prefer in TATE; Cordelia is prettily introduced, and the &s;entiments &s;he utters render her extremely amiable; &s;o material an object of the plot as &s;he is, &s;hould not be left long un&s;een; her filial duty is plea&s;ing|ly di&s;played, and we wi&s;h that &s;o meritorious a &s;peech as what follows &s;hould have been overlook|ed by TATE, when he might have &s;o much im|proved the acting merit of Cordelia, by putting it in her mouth; it occurs in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the third act, as SHAKESPEARE wrote it, and di&s;plays a mo&s;t fanciful picture of Lear's deplorable &s;itua|tion; a few verbal alterations would &s;uit it to the purpo&s;e we mention, and the introduction of it is recommended to any lady who performs Cordelia &mdash;Suppo&s;e it run thus:
<Q><L>Oh, Glo&s;ter, I have heard the poor unhappy king,</L>
<L>Contending with the fretful elements;</L>
<L>Bids the wind blow the earth into the &s;ea,</L>
<L>Or &s;well the curl'd waters 'bove the main,</L>

<L>The lion, and the belly-pinch'd wolf,</L>
<L>Keep their fur dry&mdash;Unbonneted he runs,</L>
<L>And bids what will take all.</L></Q></P>
<P>The preceding &s;peech is a poetical gem which mo&s;t undoubtedly &s;hould not be lo&s;t, e&s;pecially
<PB N="360" REF="376">
when it may be pre&s;erved with &s;o much propriety. The great defect of SHAKESPEARE's Cordelia is, that &s;he makes too incon&s;iderable a figure; is too &s;eldom in view, and has not matter for a capital ac|tre&s;s to di&s;play exten&s;ive talents in. COLMAN has too implicitly maintained this poverty of character, and even TATE's improvement falls &s;hort of what might have been; every alterer of SHAKE|SPEARE &s;hould remember, there were no female performers in his days, and improve according to the pre&s;ent time, &s;uch parts as nece&s;&s;ity, not want of genius or knowledge, made him abbre|viate.</P>
<P>Edmund's villainous de&s;ign upon Cordelia fills up, but cannot blacken the character of a man who is &s;avage enough to premeditate the death of his own father; and the circum&s;tance is well conceived to rai&s;e a tender anxiety in an audience, for the &s;afety of &s;o dutiful and amiable a prince&s;s, who&s;e pious affection makes her determine, amid&s;t many perils, to &s;eek for and cheri&s;h, that very father who has treated her with &s;uch unprovoked &s;everity.</P>
<P>Lear and Kent again offer them&s;elves to view; when it appears, that an interval of calmne&s;s, a ray of rea&s;on breaks in upon the former, who, after &s;ome very pregnant and affecting remarks upon his own condition, and the &s;hocking cau&s;e of it&mdash;filial ingratitude; &s;ubmits to the per&s;ua&s;ion of his tru&s;ty follower, and con&s;ents to take &s;helter in a hovel. Their approach to this wretched refuge for di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed royalty, calls Edgar, in his bedlamite garb and expre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;tage. It was a mo&s;t ma&s;terly
<PB N="361" REF="377">
thought of SHAKESPEARE, to make the a&s;&s;umed madman cau&s;e an in&s;tantaneous return of Lear's frenzy: indeed, the beautiful di&s;tinction he has made between real and affected madne&s;s, cannot be &s;ufficiently admired. In all Edgar's flights, we may plainly perceive a laboured diffu&s;ion of ideas; a methodical &s;train of images, and a &s;tudied wild|ne&s;s, adverting to no particular leading &s;ubject; in the execution of this, our author has been amaz|ingly &s;ucce&s;sful, beyond imagination luxuriant. From Lear we have not a &s;yllable but directs either to the original cau&s;e of his frenzy, or collaterally alludes to it. Among many other matchle&s;s beau|ties which occur in this &s;cene, we cannot find words to expre&s;s our feelings of the king's &s;up|po&s;ing that nothing could reduce nature to &s;o wretched a &s;tate as Edgar's, but unkind daugh|ters; con&s;equently that he, like him&s;elf, is an un|happy father: that &s;peech which begins,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a &s;erv|ing man proud of heart,</Q>
we deem inimitable; as well as that of Lear, which follows it.</P>
<P>The incident of Edgar's &s;aving Cordelia from the Ba&s;tard's ruffians, it not only as we think, de|fen&s;ible, but worthy of prai&s;e as a happy thought, and well calculated for action; as is the prince&s;s's cordial and becoming deportment to her exiled de|liverer, when he makes him&s;elf known. This &s;cene ever has, and ever will have, except upon unfeel|ing, &s;toical critici&s;m, a very engaging effect; it en|riches and recommends both the characters &s;o much, that we mu&s;t pronounce Mr. COLMAN's ob|jection
<PB N="362" REF="378">
to it, as the whim&s;ical offspring of judg|ment too &s;queami&s;hly cha&s;te; e&s;pecially where, in his preface, he &s;neers at Cordelia's embracing the ragged Edgar. We are &s;orry for that gentleman's notions of love and gratitude, if he thinks they are confined to externals: if the prince&s;s, through fal&s;e delicacy, had &s;hunned Edgar, merely on ac|count of his mean attire, &s;he mu&s;t appear unwor|thy the regard of him, or any other worthy man. The matter appeals to us in &s;o fair a point of view, that we are bold to &s;ay, if SHAKESPEARE, that competent and liberal judge of human nature, was alive, he would con&s;ider this addition as an ornament al&s;o. Critics upon the drama, &s;hould not only have good heads, but feeling hearts; if either requi&s;ite is wanting, we &s;hould chu&s;e to &s;pare the former, and try nature at her own bar, without Ari&s;totelian legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>We heartily with that the in&s;ignificant, cruel, offen&s;ive &s;cene, where Glo&s;ter's eyes are put out, had been left to narration; the &s;ubject of it, while in action, is &s;hocking, and Cornwall's &s;cuffle with his dome&s;tic, ludicrous; both circum&s;tances would have approached well in de&s;cription, and &s;o the &s;tage would have been &s;aved from very unbecoming tran&s;actions: however, both the alterers, through a reverence even for SHAKESPEARE's blemi&s;hes, or want of invention, have pre&s;erved what we thus object to.</P>
<P>We are not much plea&s;ed with TATE's fir&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act, where the Ba&s;tard and Regan are produced for no purpo&s;e, but for her to give him a picture, and for him to drop a note he

<P>TATE's introduction of Cordelia, with Kent &s;till in &s;earch of her father, is plea&s;ingly imagined; what pa&s;&s;es between them and poor, dark Glo&s;ter, de&s;erves approbation; and the mention of a popu|lar ri&s;ing in favour of the old king is well thrown in Goneril's &s;ucceeding interview with her &s;teward and the duke of Albany her hu&s;band, is much more explicit and &s;atisfactory in COLMAN's than TATE's; it gives likewi&s;e more time for Edgar to change his frantic habiliments into tho&s;e of a pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene, the de&s;cription of Dover cliff engages and gratifies ta&s;te abundantly; though making Glo&s;ter fancy he has fallen down &s;uch a precipice, is a bold, it is no unnatural &s;tretch of

imagination, where a mind is agonized like his by a combination of painful and di&s;tracting events, and wi&s;hes to put a period to woe by terminating exi&s;tence; &s;plenetic per&s;ons we know, by a mul|titude of in&s;tances, conceive and credit as great ab&s;urdities; and why the mere matter of falling on the &s;tage &s;hould be laughable we know not. Of this we are certain, that a Glo&s;ter, otherwi&s;e re&s;pectable, would never occa&s;ion even a critical &s;mile; but Mr. COLMAN judges, perhaps, from &s;ome in&s;tances at Covent-Garden; and if the&s;e influenced him, he would have been prudent in cutting out three-fourths of the part: be&s;ides, as the matter appears, in his alteration, Glo&s;ter &s;tands within a foot of the extreme verge of the cliff, yet upon hearing the king, whom he knows to be mad, he never mentions &s;afer footing, nor ever after mentions the re&s;olution of ending his life in &s;uch a manner. Now, in the original and TATE, there is a very good rea&s;on for not con|tinuing &s;uch a determination; &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf preferred by a providential interpo&s;ition, he re|&s;olves to bear his afflictions with a becoming re|&s;ignation. If this incident was le&s;s defen&s;ible in point of probability, it gives &s;o fine a warning again&s;t the wor&s;t of crimes, &s;uicide, and incul|cates &s;o u&s;eful, &s;o moral a le&s;&s;on of bearing up under temporal affliction, that we cannot enter|tain any doubt of the propriety in retaining it.</P>
<P>Lear's madne&s;s is finely, though not quite &s;o characteri&s;tically &s;upported in this &s;cene as in the third act. Though women have been the cau&s;e of
<PB N="365" REF="381">
his wretchedne&s;s, we with what he &s;ays of them in the &s;peech that begins in both the alterations, "Behold yon &s;impering dame," had been totally omitted; it is, indeed, con&s;iderably &s;oftened from SHAKESPEARE, but as rai&s;ing ful&s;ome ideas is its only tendency, we wi&s;h it &s;truck entirely out.</P>
<P>The encounter between Edgar and Goneril's gentleman-u&s;her, we by no means like, it brings an unnece&s;&s;ary death upon the &s;tage; the lady's attachment to Edmund, and murderous de&s;igns upon her hu&s;band, might have been di&s;covered in a much more &s;uitable manner.</P>
<P>COLMAN's beginning the fifth act with Lear upon his couch, is certainly better than making it end the fourth, as TATE has done: however, the &s;cene is very much indebted to that gentleman for the merit we find in it; nor do we remember one of more affecting nature upon the &s;ingle feel|ing of pity: Mr. COLMAN certainly did right to adopt it; we deem him al&s;o commendable for omitting the &s;hort interview between Goneril and an attendant, where &s;he mentions the de&s;ign of poi&s;oning her rival &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>By the Ba&s;tard's &s;oliloquy, we find him in fre&s;h de&s;igns of villainy; we do not &s;ee why Glo&s;ter &s;hould be brought in merely for Edgar to leave him beneath a tree; however Tate has given him a re&s;pectable &s;peech, which COLMAN, for what rea&s;on we cannot tell, has curtailed; eighteen lines furni&s;h a better pau&s;e for the &s;kirmi&s;h that is &s;uppo&s;ed than &s;even; e&s;pecially when they are &s;uited to the circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="382">The turn of King Lear's being defeated is thea|trically conceived; from this point the alterers go pretty near hand in hand together to the cata|&s;trophe; wherefore we &s;hall now only trace the following &s;cenes in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as TATE has ranged them: when Edgar di&s;gui&s;ed has given a challenge to his brother Edmund, we are pre|&s;ented with Lear, Kent, and Cordelia in pri&s;on, where a happy &s;troke occurs in the king's being overpowered at the di&s;covery of Kent's being his tru&s;ty Caius; though this &s;cene is not very &s;triking, it &s;till commands attention.</P>
<P>The encounter between the two brothers is very &s;pirited, and making Edgar the &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;tru|ment of Edmund's puni&s;hment, is a plea&s;ing in|&s;tance of poetical ju&s;tice; we could have wi&s;hed the ladies ab&s;ent, for their contention about the Ba&s;tard, is rather laughable, this COLMAN has prudently avoided.</P>
<P>Lear, in pri&s;on, attended by his faithful daugh|ter, again calls upon our feelings; the attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him alarms human apprehen&s;ion, and the happy effect of his de&s;peration, rai&s;es a degree of &s;atisfactory a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Edgar's approach with Albany confirms the royal pri&s;oners &s;afety, and different events fall in very na|turally; we mu&s;t not only give TATE great prai&s;e for bringing about a happy cata&s;trophe, by pro|bable circum&s;tances; but, in point of ju&s;tice, en|deavour to prove, that his di&s;tribution of the cha|racters is much better than that in the original, or that in Mr. COLMAN's &s;uppo&s;ed amendment of the alteration.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="383">That Lear, as a ra&s;h and rigid father, de&s;erves puni&s;hment is very obvious, this is &s;ufficiently in|flicted by his madne&s;s, therefore &s;aving his life was undoubtedly ju&s;t: Glo&s;ter comes under the &s;ame predicament of blame, for pur&s;uing even the life of an innocent &s;on; the ungrateful daughters de&s;erve the rigour of ju&s;tice, and could not fall more properly than by the barbarity of each other; and the Ba&s;tard lo&s;es his life mo&s;t righteou&s;ly, by the hand of his injured brother; Cordelia's piety merits the highe&s;t reward of temporal happine&s;s, which TATE has given her, by a connection with the man of her heart; the becoming a queen, through France's generous behaviour, as we do not hear of any previous attachment in his favour, cannot be deemed &s;o delicate or adequate a com|pen&s;ation for her virtues, as be&s;towing her on Ed|gar, who is thereby al&s;o recompen&s;ed in a pecu|liar manner for both the love and loyalty he has manife&s;ted; the old king's con&s;ent, with Glo&s;ter's and Kent's hearty ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hed a brilliance on TATE's la&s;t &s;cene, highly plea&s;ing to every good and tender mind; it adds great force to the old king's re&s;toration, and furni&s;hes, to our appre|hen&s;ion, as &s;atisfactory and compleat a cata&s;tro|phe as any in the whole &s;cope of dramatic com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>We perfectly join in opinion, that Lear &s;hould &s;peak la&s;t, but think Mr. COLMAN might have avoided the trouble of patching up a concluding &s;peech, when that we find in TATE, preceding Edgar's, is &s;ufficient without any alteration or
<PB N="368" REF="384">
addition; it is matter of no little &s;urprize, that the &s;olici&s;m of bringing Cordelia to view, as queen of France, without any mention of her royal con|&s;ort, or any attendance equal to her &s;tation, &s;hould not have &s;truck Mr. COLMAN's critical ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we mu&s;t remark, that in re&s;pect of the two alterations, TATE had no guide but his own judgment, which, though very fallible in many places, has yet operated &s;ucce&s;sfully upon the whole; Mr. COLMAN had his labours, as well as the origi|nal to work upon; and has &s;hewed great mode&s;ty in avoiding additions, con&s;iderable merit in re&s;toring &s;o much of SHAKESPEARE; but has certainly weak|ened the piece, both for action and peru&s;al, by re|jecting &s;o ju&s;tifiable, plea&s;ing, natural and relative an epi&s;ode, as the loves of Edgar and Cordelia; for the credit of SHAKESPEARE, TATE, COLMAN, and advantage of the &s;tage; we wi&s;h an able critic, Mr. GARRICK, for In&s;tance, would undertake a <HI>third</HI> al|teration upon medium principles, between the lati|tude of TATE, and the circum&s;cription of COLMAN.</P>
<P>King Lear's character, as a man, we know no|thing of, except from the conci&s;e picture of his being choleric and ra&s;h; there are no opportunities of di&s;playing either virtues or vices; the Impetuo&s;ity of his temper fir&s;t makes him a very culpable fa|ther, and afterwards, mingled with pride, runs him into di&s;traction; the unnatural cruelty of his daugh|ters, renders him an object of pity, and SHAKE|SPEARE's irre&s;i&s;tible genius has drawn him a cha|racter of admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="385">To enter upon the repre&s;entation of this odd and violent old monarch, is a daring flight of the|atrical re&s;olution; a wide and various complica|tion of requi&s;ites, are e&s;&s;ential to placing him in a proper and &s;triking point of view; e&s;pecially an imagination po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame fine frenzy which fir&s;t drew him into light; his &s;ituations, &s;enti|ments, and language being peculiar, &s;o mu&s;t his tones, looks and ge&s;tures be, mechanical acting, which may pa&s;s agreeably enough in other &s;maller creations of the brain, mu&s;t here flatten idea to a very palling degree.</P>
<P>Come forth the man whom nature has happily formed to animate with unrivalled excellence this her mo&s;t favourite theatrical production&mdash;GAR|RICK, come forth! fearle&s;s of &s;evere&s;t critici&s;m; we, who, have &s;ingularly and repeatedly felt the mo&s;t inde&s;cribable &s;en&s;ations from this gentleman's per|formance of King Lear, are obliged to confe&s;s, that had he plea&s;ed us le&s;s, we &s;hould have been able to &s;ay more; there is a tran&s;cendant degree of merit which checks the bolde&s;t flight of prai&s;e, and here mo&s;t certainly we have encountered it; but the more danger the more honour&mdash;therefore, we ru&s;h fearle&s;s amid&s;t an abundance of beauties, hoping we &s;hall &s;elect, with &s;ome judgment, though &s;atisfaction is bewildered with variety.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remembered, that Lear is a monarch who, amid&s;t the infirmities of age, has all the pride of royalty about him, and con&s;equently aims at &s;upporting external dignity, as far as the decline of &s;trength will admit; this natural &s;truggle between
<PB N="370" REF="386">
vanity and debilitation, is as happily di&s;played as po&s;&s;ible, in the con&s;equential feeblene&s;s of Mr. GARRICK's deportments; &s;trength and activity of &s;pirit are by him mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly united to nerve|le&s;s limbs; in the &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, you perceive the quick flow of blood giving momen|tary firmne&s;s to his &s;inews, which pa&s;&s;ing off, an increa&s;e of languor &s;ucceeds; in his execration of Goneril, at the end of the fir&s;t act, his face di&s;plays &s;uch a combination of painful, enraged feelings, as &s;carce any countenance but his own could de|&s;cribe, though &s;o happily pictured that the dulle&s;t mind mu&s;t conceive and feel.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd act, where he parlies between Go|neril and Regan, who alternately reject him, rage and tenderne&s;s, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed fury and affectionate conde&s;cen&s;ion, are mingled happily till the con|clu&s;ive &s;peech, where his breaks of voice, and va|riation of features, &s;urpa&s;s the fine&s;t conception that has not been impre&s;&s;ed by him, and leave tho&s;e who have &s;een him without words to de|&s;cribe.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, we plainly perceive the elementary conflict re-imaged in his di&s;tracted looks, while the eyes are al&s;o fea&s;ted by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ive, &s;triking attitudes; but a peculiar beauty is, the unparallelled force with which he &s;peaks, "Have his daughters brought him to this pa&s;s;" and many other &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages, which pa&s;s almo&s;t unnoticed from the mouth of every other Lear we have &s;een in &s;hort, through the whole of the madne&s;s, he cuts competition &s;hort by mo&s;t evident &s;uperiority.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pray do not mock me, &amp;c."</Q>
to Cordelia, and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Did I not, fellow?"</Q>
after demoli&s;hing the ruffians, we conceive his merit to reach beyond all expectation; after the&s;e faint outlines of excellence, &s;o &s;trongly felt by the heart, and &s;o fully approved by the head, permit us, reader, to prophecy, that as no man will ever draw a character of more impor|tance and variety than SHAKESPEARE's Lear, &s;o we apprehend no per&s;on will ever &s;hew a more pow|erful, correct, affecting, original, and cha&s;te piece of acting than Mr. GARRICK's performance of him has done.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY, with a commendable degree of ambition, entered the li&s;ts of competition, as we think, &s;ixteen or eighteen years ago, and met with an exten&s;ive &s;hare of de&s;erved applau&s;e; like a plau&s;ible, &s;howy piece of painting, with fine tints, and a few ma&s;terly touches of the pencil, he entirely gratified &s;ome judgments, and for a while captivated tho&s;e of more penetration; but, to carry on the allu&s;ion, when harmony of parts, and &s;trict propriety of expre&s;&s;ion were minutely &s;ought after, the piece lo&s;t great part of its effect, and &s;unk in value; in &s;hort, this performer, to whom na|ture was prodigally kind, in many requi&s;ites, wanted what his great competitor eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; we mean original perception; his acting, e&s;pecially in Lear, was too dependent upon in&s;truction, and
<PB N="372" REF="388">
pre&s;ented it&s;elf the offspring of a hundred critical opinions jumbled; it was very evident he felt more the ideas of his in&s;tructing friends, than what the author furni&s;hed him to &s;ay; however, it is but ju&s;tice to allow that he availed him&s;elf happily of friendly intimation, and was, in many parts of the fir&s;t, &s;econd and fifth acts, truly &s;triking; nay, through the whole, he &s;tood in high re&s;pect, unle&s;s when compared with much more capital merit.</P>
<P>We cannot help &s;miling to hear the &s;anguine admirers of Mr. POWELL, for many that excellent young actor had ju&s;tly gained, &s;ay, that he was <HI>near</HI> as great as Mr. GARRICK; one at fir&s;t would &s;uppo&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion ironical &s;atire, but as we be|lieve &s;ome had per&s;uaded them&s;elves to believe it really was &s;o, it becomes our duty, from the mo&s;t impartial, and we hope liberal di&s;&s;ection of merit, to &s;ay, that his de&s;erving &s;unk amazingly from a critical compari&s;on; his deportment was abomi|ble, not a trace of maje&s;ty in it; his tran&s;itions in the violent parts, wanted e&s;&s;ential volubility, and mo&s;t of his attitudes were injudiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed; in the tender &s;trokes and feeblene&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which occur in the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fifth act, he was excellent; but, if mo&s;t part of the third and fourth acts had been omitted when he performed the character, it would not have dimini&s;hed &s;atisfaction; we allow him more nature, but le&s;s expre&s;&s;ion than Mr. BARRY, but place him far, far beneath Mr. GARRICK in both.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="389">Mr. ROSS exhibits his u&s;ual and di&s;gu&s;tful ine|quality remarkably in this part; one &s;cene de&s;erv|ing approbation, the next contempt; in &s;hort, we deem it too ponderous a weight for his abilities to &s;u&s;tain with ju&s;t grace; Mr. DIGGES, whom we have &s;omewhere mentioned, did &s;ome &s;cenes of Lear, the madne&s;s in particular, great ju&s;tice, but was rather tedious and unaffecting upon the whole; we have heard, but hope it is not true, that the poor old monarch has &s;uffered theatrical a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from the relentle&s;s attempts of Me&s;&s;rs. QUIN and MOSSOP, who, we are confident, mu&s;t have tortured every &s;yllable of him.</P>
<P>Edgar, as drawn by TATE, is an amiable and in|tere&s;ting character, dutiful to his father, un&s;u&s;pect|ing to his ba&s;e brother, con&s;tant in love, &s;tedfa&s;t in loyalty, re&s;olute in danger; Me&s;&s;rs. RYAN and HAVARD &s;upported this character with great abilities, and with &s;uch parallel merit, that we hardly know how to grant a preference, yet are rather inclined to the former, as throwing more wildne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and extravagance of action into the a&s;&s;umed madne&s;s: Mr. SMITH and RED|DISH (particularly the latter) give con&s;iderable plea&s;ure at pre&s;ent, and, we think upon ju&s;t principles; the former, however, is injured as a performer by Mr. COLMAN's palpable mutilation of the part, in his alteration.</P>
<P>Glo&s;ter is a character of no con&s;picuous qualities; the Ba&s;tard ju&s;tly calls him credulous, and we are willing to con&s;ider him as a weak, hone&s;t man; upon the &s;tage Mr. SPARKS made him extremely
<PB N="374" REF="390">
re&s;pectable, and Mr. BERRY was not far behind: at pre&s;ent&mdash;oh heav'ns!&mdash;he is in the feeble hands of Mr. BURTON at Drury Lane, and incumbers the tottering abilities of Mr. GIBSON at Covent-Garden. Do, kind, conde&s;cending managers, re|lieve the&s;e overburthened gentlemen, by putting Mr. HULL and Mr. Mr. BANNISTER in their places.</P>
<P>Kent we admire as a worthy, undi&s;gui&s;ed, uni|form miracle of a courtier; bold enough to &s;peak truth, where &s;he &s;eldom comes, in the pre&s;ence of a king, and hone&s;t enough to follow that king's fortunes when deprived not only of his power, but even the common comforts of life; the character is finely imagined, and happily introduced; we don't remember, nor indeed don't de&s;ire to &s;ee it better &s;u&s;tained than by Mr. CLARKE, who hits off the cynical roughne&s;s well, and yet pre&s;erves the gentleman; Mr. BRANSBY mu&s;t excu&s;e us, if we &s;ay, he rather puts us in mind of a reduced life-guard-man, than a di&s;gui&s;ed peer.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;tard is a complicated villain of the deepe&s;t die, performed with &s;ome degree of merit by the late Mr. PALMER, who had, however, too much levity of figure and deportment in him; the pre&s;ent Mr. PALMER's appearance is much better and his acting as well; Mr. BENSLEY's idea of Edmund is ju&s;t, and his expre&s;&s;ion adequate; nor was Mr. CLARKE any way deficient in the repre|&s;entation of him.</P>
<P>The Gentleman U&s;her was formerly exhibited with a fund of exqui&s;ite whim by Mr. WOOD|WARD, and is plea&s;antly enough &s;ituated with

Me&s;&s;rs. DYER and DODD; but &s;et forth by Mr. CUSHING, he is the exact type of "Coming up, &s;ir, &mdash;Gentlemen, did you call&mdash;</P>
<P>Goneril and Regan are characters infamou&s;ly black, but not as Dr. WARTON &s;eems to doubt im|po&s;&s;ible or even improbable; for we have too many originals of filial ingratitude in real life, to verify &s;uch mimic repre&s;entations of it. SHAKESPEARE's &s;trong painting, and placing the circum&s;tances in the fir&s;t &s;phere of life, may make the matter from apparent exaggeration dubitable; but human tran|&s;actions prove, in this point, as well as many others, what benevolent feelings reluctantly ad|mit, and with great difficulty conceive.</P>
<P>In the light of female mon&s;ters, which un|doubtedly they appear, it would be a coar&s;e com|pliment to &s;ay any ladies looked or played them thoroughly in character; therefore, we &s;hall not critici&s;e any who have appeared in the two el|der &s;i&s;ters; what they uttered has come no doubt again&s;t original feeling, and it would be rather cruel to try their merit in &s;uch di&s;agree|able undertakings; po&s;&s;ibly no two were ever more unlike the barbarity they repre&s;ent than Mrs. STEPHENS and Mrs. W. BARRY, nor any two more agreeable to the audience, under &s;uch ungra|cious circum&s;tances: ungratefully cruel to a bene|volent father, faithle&s;s to their hu&s;bands, and vin|dictive to each other; all repre&s;entation mu&s;t fall &s;hort of what the author apparently de&s;igned; and indeed we are glad that what mu&s;t &s;hock nature in the fainte&s;t view, cannot come forth with the ad|dition

of richer colouring; we al&s;o think, that &s;uch pictures of the human &s;pecies as repre&s;ent a complication of vices, without one gleam of virtue, &s;hould be &s;eldom &s;hewn to the public.</P>
<P>Cordelia is finely oppo&s;ed to her &s;i&s;ters, and &s;hines with double lu&s;tre from their darkne&s;s; dutiful under &s;evere provocation to the contrary; firm and di&s;intere&s;ted in her attachment to Ed|gar; there is nothing extraordinary of acting merit in TATE's, and much le&s;s in COLMAN's; in compliment to Lear, &s;he is generally given to the fir&s;t actre&s;s, whether fit for her or no; delicacy of figure, and tenderne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, are all the requi&s;ites which &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for her; Mrs. CIBBER was no doubt very plea&s;ing, but during our remembrance too much of the woman; as Mrs. YATES is at pre&s;ent, with the un&s;ufferable addition of an imperious, uncharacteri&s;tic a&s;pect: Mrs. BELLAMY looked the part amiably, but tuned the words mo&s;t monotonou&s;ly: Mrs. BAR|RY &s;peaks and feels it extremely well, but rather outfigures it; and we apprehend that very de&s;erv|ing young actre&s;s, Mrs. BULKELEY&mdash;why is &s;he &s;o neglected by the managers?&mdash;would render Corde|lia more agreeable than any other lady now on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>This tragedy, in its original &s;tate, exhibits a beau|tiful collection of poetical flowers, choaked up with a profu&s;ion of weeds, the unretrenched produce of luxuriant fertility; and it was an undertaking of great merit to root up the latter, without injuring the former; how far TATE, the fir&s;t adventurer, and COLMAN, his &s;uvervi&s;or, have &s;ucceeded, we
<PB N="377" REF="393">
hope the reader may collect from our animad|ver&s;ions.</P>
<P>The language of King Lear is of mixed nature, ver&s;e and pro&s;e; where the former occurs, we find it bold, nervous, figurative, and, with &s;ome few exceptions, flowing; the latter is compact, pregnant and &s;pirited; the characters are various, and mo&s;tly very intere&s;ting, well grouped to &s;hew each other; the plot is rather disjointed, and the &s;cenes frequently intrude upon the unities of time and place; but the cata&s;trophe, &s;o happily con|ceived by TATE, attones for all the unreformed irregularities; and, we may venture to &s;ay, that from his hands the public have received a dra|matic piece, which appeals &s;o powerfully to the pa&s;&s;ions, that when performed with &s;uitable abi|lities, it proves rather a degree of painful plea|&s;ure, and &s;hrinks nature back upon her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the clo&s;et it mu&s;t furni&s;h particular gratifi|cation to critical judgment, but will always be caviare to the generality of readers.</P>

<P>THE comedy we are ju&s;t entering upon, is in|troduced like Mr. FOOTE'S MINOR, by a pre|lude; but has had a manife&s;t advantage of this in the propriety and force of action, by the author's <HI>viva voce</HI> appearance to repre&s;ent him&s;elf; be|&s;ides, it will appear by compari&s;on, that there was not only much more occa&s;ion for the one than the other, but a far greater &s;hare of executive power al&s;o manife&s;ted; we &s;hall not draw a pa|rallel, as every reader may do that at plea&s;ure by turning a few leaves back.</P>
<P>Jenkins and Townly, the one a partridge-&s;hooter, as he &s;ays him&s;elf, the other any thing you plea&s;e, commence Mr. COLMAN's prelude with reading the bill of the play, which occa&s;ions one to a&s;k, and the other to hint who the author is; when immediately the bard appears cloathed in mourning; obviou&s;ly to excite two &s;en&s;ations, extremely con&s;onant to comedy; grief for a de|cea&s;ed friend, and pity for the author's tickli&s;h &s;ituation. However melancholy this &s;able figure made us when fir&s;t exhibited, we cannot help &s;miling at the idea of introducing mirthful &s;cenes with &s;o melancholy an object; &s;omewhat &s;imilar to a hear&s;e preceeding the lord mayor's &s;hew.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="395">But what is the purport of Mr. Dapperwit and friend's conver&s;ation: fir&s;t, a facetious &s;troke upon Mr. COLMAN's &s;ingular good fortune in having annuities repeatedly bequeathed him; &s;econd, an unnece&s;&s;ary intimation of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained in Mr. POWELL, which the audience well knew without being &s;o informed of the matter; third, a promi&s;e, which has not yet been ful|filled, of diligently improving public entertain|ment; fourth, a pitiful compliment to public good nature; fifth, a mo&s;t extraordinary defence of Mr. GARRICK'S ODE, and a laborious, unin|telligible a&s;&s;imilation of Mr. FOOTE's &s;atirical wit to Fuller's earth, which we can reconcile no otherwi&s;e than in the following round-about matter. GAY &s;ays, "Gold is the true Fuller's earth to take out every &s;pot and &s;tain;" now as Mr. FOOTE's wit is univer&s;ally allowed <HI>&s;terling,</HI> his brother manager catched the idea, perhaps, from thence.</P>
<P>The managerical parley founded in this exqui|&s;ite &s;cene to &s;weeten Mr. GARRICK for antici|pating his pageant, was very ju&s;tly compared by a wag to the care&s;&s;es of a pro&s;titute, who, while &s;he embraces her gallant, picks his pockets. As Mr. COLMAN is deemed, and indeed has proved him&s;elf a cla&s;&s;ical writer in general, we wonder how the following Hibernici&s;m, among &s;ome other &s;lips, could e&s;cape his pen: Dapperwit &s;peaking of the pageant and ma&s;querade, &s;ays, "Tho&s;e you &s;hall &s;ee, Sir, and perhaps they may appear to more advantage, and be &s;een with
<PB N="380" REF="396">
more &s;atisfaction at the Theatres-Royal than Stratford ITSELF;" What liberal elegance of phra&s;eolocry! ITSELF.</P>
<P>Having &s;tretched this prelude, which by no means incurs the cen&s;ure of being too witty; we are confident enough to pronounce the favourable reception it met, as an almo&s;t unparallelled proof of critical lenity: indeed, it contains &s;uch peti|tioning &s;upplication, that mercy could not refu&s;e her &s;miles, however impartial under&s;tanding was obliged to frown. As to the performance of Me&s;&s;ieurs HULL, DYER and WROUGHTON bore up a dead weight of in&s;ipidity agreeable enough.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene of MAN and WIFE opens in a public hou&s;e, full of that bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion which an overflow of company occa&s;ions: a gouty Landlord hobbles about, exerting his lungs though he cannot make much u&s;e of his feet; Luke the waiter's directions to his &s;ub&s;titutes, and naming the rooms after SHAKESPEARE's plays, are plea&s;ant enough; the introduction of Buck, and his con|ver&s;ation with the waiter, have nature and &s;pirit; Snarl &s;eems introduced for nothing but to com|plain of his bed; mention of the little army that walked over him, is not &s;trictly delicate. After the departure of the&s;e three, fre&s;h hurry is occa|&s;ioned by the arrival of the Birmingham coach, which, as we are informed, has been overturned; from this incident &s;ome humourous remarks ari&s;e, e&s;pecially tho&s;e made by the &s;ea-faring pa&s;&s;enger, who&s;e idea of flying, as it is called, conveys a whim&s;ical effect. Indeed, all the pa&s;&s;en|gers,
<PB N="381" REF="397">
though &s;hort, are well &s;upported, and the Landlady's account of the jubilee is very laugh|able.</P>
<P>We do not much approve the &s;tage coachman, who is drawn a civil creature, contrary to the well-known behaviour of &s;uch gentry: his ha&s;tening the pa&s;&s;engers &s;hould have been in a more peremptory &s;tile; when the other pa&s;&s;engers are gone, we per|ceive colonel Frankly remaining; who, on being told the coach is &s;etting off, declares he will go no further: from his &s;oliloquy we collect, that a love-affair has brought him to Stratford, and that his mi&s;tre&s;s has reached it the day before.</P>
<P>Marcourt, a coxcomb of the current year, and rival to Frankly, now enter in the tip of the riding mode: his dialogue is plea&s;ant, &s;pirited and &s;ati|rical; but we apprehend his intimate mention of Peers, with a very &s;light alteration, is borrowed from Clodio in the Fop's Fortune; the common affectation of riding, though &s;carce out of the &s;treets; the journal of vi&s;iting on hor&s;eback, the &s;arca&s;tical &s;trokes again&s;t enormous club-wigs, Lilliputian hats, and &s;ome other peculiarities of the reigning fa&s;hion are humourou&s;ly conceived and adequately expre&s;&s;ed. The following &s;troke met with particular applau&s;e, and in a great mea|&s;ure de&s;erved it, where Frankly &s;ays, "Do you intend to &s;hew your&s;elf as one of the characters of SHAKESPEARE." Marcourt replies, "No faith; &s;uch an original did not exi&s;t in his days." We agree with our author, that perhaps an exact &s;imilitude cannot be traced; but are not O&s;trick,
<PB N="382" REF="398">
Lucio, &amp;c. Marcourt's? an ob&s;ervation which immediately follows, we think more &s;ignificant, though it pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed; "one mu&s;t have a wife, you know, if it is only for the plea&s;ure of getting rid of her," this is levelled with com|mendable poignancy again&s;t the divorces &s;o &s;hamefully prevalent among&s;t the great world.</P>
<P>In the en&s;uing conver&s;ation between Marcourt and the colonel, an account is plea&s;antly given of Mr. and Mrs. Cro&s;s, father and mother of the young lady who is the object of their mutual at|tention; we are al&s;o made acquainted with Kitchen, a third gallant, the favourite of Mr. Cro&s;s: this rival is de&s;cribed &s;o well, that we cannot avoid pre&s;enting his picture in the author's words&mdash;"He is dull, dull as Colonel Grin, who has got Joe Miller by heart, and is always teazing you with a &s;tory&mdash;no <HI>&s;pla&s;h</HI> in the world&mdash;his con|ver&s;ation is all table-talk&mdash;made up of eating and drinking&mdash;he is a mere walking larder&mdash;his mind is a great pantry, from which he is always &s;erving up &s;ome choice di&s;hes, for the entertainment of his friends and acquaintances." Marcourt appears, confident of the young lady's favour, and intimates her joining with him and Mrs. Cro&s;s, in defeating her father's intentions.</P>
<P>The di&s;ciple of Epicurus, Kitchen, upon his entrance, adverts the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of eating and drinking, which furni&s;hes fre&s;h matter for ob|&s;ervation; when Marcourt objects to a jubilee from not liking one he has &s;een at Rome, the Landlord makes an excellent &s;troke "There is
<PB N="383" REF="399">
no popery in our Jubilee, though it began with going to church."</P>
<P>Mention of Rome, occa&s;ions Kitchen to remark its fallen &s;tate, which he illu&s;trates by a very cha|racteri&s;tic &s;imile of "a &s;irloin of beef to a &s;poonful of macaroni;" this occa&s;ions an altercation between the coxcomb's foreign ta&s;te and the cit's nationality; wherein the latter has a very manife&s;t advantage, particularly in this &s;entence, "As for you fine gen|tlemen, you &s;kim the cream of Europe, as you &s;ay, and bring home nothing but froth and whip &s;illa|bub." The di&s;pute about SHAKESPEARE, occa&s;ions a very tolerable apology for the mo&s;t obvious blemi&s;hes of that admirable author, and they are mo&s;t excellently &s;ummed up in the following pa&s;|&s;age, which has as much merit as any one of equal length we ever met with; "SHAKESPEARE, Mr. Marcourt, SHAKESPEARE is the turtle of litera|ture; the lean of him perhaps may be wor&s;e than the lean of any other meat; but there is a deal of green fat, which is the mo&s;t delicious &s;tuff in the world."</P>
<P>After the critical di&s;putation Charlotte is men|tioned, when each &s;eems &s;o &s;ure of gaining her, that a wager is laid, and put into the colonel's hands; after which Marcourt and Kitchen de|part to gratify their different attachments of gor|mandizing and foppery.</P>
<P>The &s;econd act begins with Mr. and Mrs. Cro&s;s at breakfa&s;t; both mo&s;t thoroughly di&s;po&s;ed to contradiction, in the true &s;pirit of matrimonial contention, they brow-beat each other for trifles,
<PB N="384" REF="400">
and de&s;igned mi&s;interpretation; one finds fault with every article, and the other vindicates the whole; till Cro&s;s at length repents coming to Stratford, which he ju&s;tly calls a ridiculous journey; but the lady maintains warmly her ta&s;te for fa&s;hion and con&s;equence, which draws from her hu&s;band a &s;troke of well applied u&s;eful &s;atire, "Becau&s;e a counte&s;s, who has a room as long as Pall Mall, gets the whole town together at her route, you mu&s;t have a route too, and &s;queeze all your company into two clo&s;ets and a cupboard&mdash; nay, la&s;t winter, when the town run ma&s;querade mad, you got a ridiculous party of fops and flirts to make fools of them&s;elves, and called it a ma&s;|querade."</P>
<P>Several other ob&s;ervations occur previous to men|tion of their daughter's marriage; upon which a fre&s;h and material difference of opinion ari&s;es, which the author has thrown into a well adapted dialogue, which at la&s;t ri&s;es into a &s;tate of natural, well-de|&s;cribed aggravation, which Kitchen's approach op|portunely checks a little; immediately after, a me&s;&s;age intimates, that Marcourt is come to wait on Mrs. Cro&s;s, this draws her off the &s;tage, and leaves the two gentlemen to a tete-a-tete, in which Cro&s;s mentions, that he has taken &s;uch &s;teps as may expedite his daughter's marriage with Mr. Kitchen; it is a &s;trange thought, however, for a father who has di&s;|po&s;al of his child, and does not &s;eem afraid of his wife, to take a hou&s;e at &s;uch a time in Stratford, for a month, that his daughter, being a pari&s;hioner, may
<PB N="385" REF="401">
thereby have an opportunity of being married by banns, but we imagine a painful nece&s;&s;ity in the plot called for this &s;trange &s;hift.</P>
<P>When Charlotte approaches we do not find her a &s;ighing, de&s;pairing dam&s;el, becau&s;e parents de|&s;ign di&s;po&s;ing of her again&s;t her inclination; but a daughter of political fine&s;&s;e, pretending ac|quie&s;cence on each &s;ide, that &s;he may have the better opportunity of deceiving both: for this purpo&s;e &s;he cordially clo&s;es with Mr. Kitchen and her father, but urges warmly the propriety of acting with &s;ecrecy; this, Mr. Cro&s;s, and the imaginary hu&s;band, come into readily: when the young lady urges that the jubilee affords a good opportunity for putting their &s;cheme in practice, Kitchen throws out the following very &s;en&s;ible remark: "Intrigues carried on in the face of the world, are always lea&s;t liable to detection; and now-a-days mo&s;t people &s;eem to act upon that principle." After this, an a&s;&s;ignation is made by Charlotte for Kitchen to meet her, when &s;he has &s;lipped on her ma&s;querade dre&s;s, a blue Turki&s;h habit.</P>
<P>When the gentlemen di&s;appear, Charlotte &s;pe|culates on the weight and intricacy of bu&s;ine&s;s which engages her attention: comparing her&s;elf to a mini&s;ter who, under various appearances, at|tends to nothing but his own &s;eparate intere&s;t is well enough, but likening a young lady to the di|rection-po&s;t of a high road is certainly&mdash;excu&s;e the pun, a piece of wooden wit.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="402">That indi&s;pen&s;ible uten&s;il in love-affairs, the chamber-maid, now approaches with intelligence that colonel Frankly is arrived, and has &s;ent a letter by her, which &s;he delivers. On being a&s;ked, if any per&s;on &s;aw it delivered to her? &s;he replies, No one but Sally, Charlotte's younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter; of whom &s;he gives an arch de&s;cription, ju&s;t previous to her entrance; yet what the young lady &s;ays, when before us, we mu&s;t pronounce much in the &s;train of mediocrity. She is curious indeed and forward, but utters nothing, that we can perceive, to rai&s;e a laugh or fix attention; her de&s;ire to be concerned in what &s;he &s;uppo&s;es mi&s;chief, is natural enough; and Lettice &s;eems prepared to gratify that girli&s;h inclination, but intimates they are not &s;ufficiently ab&s;tracted from company. The propo&s;ition of Sally's telling a fib or two, is right &s;ervant-maid in&s;truction, but when Lettice calls her <HI>a little devil,</HI> it is rather the language of a cook or &s;cullion, than that of a waiting-woman; and there is an unpardonably ful&s;ome idea conveyed in Mi&s;s Sally's knowing parody on Hodge's &s;ong of the <HI>Sheep's head and Carrot,</HI> without the lea&s;t degree of humour, at lea&s;t perceptible to us: thus &s;trangely concludes the &s;econd act, which has &s;o little &s;pirit or bu&s;ine&s;s, that we find nothing commendable in it after Mr. and Mrs. Cro&s;s, except its brevity.</P>
<P>Five pages of the book, between the &s;econd and third acts, are filled with the older of that a&s;toni&s;h|ing introduction the pageant, which has apparently as little connection with the general tenor of this
<PB N="387" REF="403">
piece as any other, and &s;eems only to have been an occa&s;ional device for &s;kimming the rich cream of curio&s;ity, which for a few nights of anticipa|tion it certainly did with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s; but vani&s;hed quickly upon the appearance of that at Drury Lane.</P>
<P>Having thus had occa&s;ion to mention the JUBI|LEE, it becomes our duty to &s;ay, that a mo&s;t ex|traordinary madne&s;s has this winter &s;eized the London audience for repeatedly, in crowds, fol|lowing near ninety nights, what will by no means bear critical di&s;&s;ection; the real jubilee at Strat|ford, if not politically intended as an introduction to what has &s;ince been exhibited here, de&s;erves no better title than theatrical idolatry; the mimic one carrying a wooden, or pa&s;teboard repre&s;entation of SHAKESPEARE about the &s;tage in a kind of lord mayor's &s;hew triumph, and pantomiming tho&s;e excellent characters which he has &s;o richly &s;up|plied with affluence of language and &s;entiment, is not only a mere money-trap, but a &s;evere, though oblique &s;atire al&s;o upon public ta&s;te, which hence &s;eems more to enjoy empty, unmeaning parade than &s;olid &s;en&s;e, or the noble&s;t flights of powerful and luxuriant fancy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, there is an agreeable di&s;h of dramatic &s;almagundy di&s;hed up at Drury Lane, in which an excellent admirably performed Hibernian is the mo&s;t high-reli&s;hed ingredient, garni&s;hed with &s;ome very tolerable ballads; that the characters are well di&s;po&s;ed, and in dumb &s;how tolerably well &s;up|ported we al&s;o acknowledge, but that public appe|tite
<PB N="388" REF="404">
&s;hould feed &s;o long and greedily upon one dainty, is almo&s;t beyond the bounds of credibility; and for managers to run it &s;o enormou&s;ly, as far be|yond the bounds of ju&s;tification; for admitting there are fools and children enough to an&s;wer the end of &s;uch unparallelled repetition, what apology can be made to the many &s;en&s;ible, di&s;tingui&s;hing friends of the theatre, who mu&s;t either ab&s;ent them&s;elves half a &s;ea&s;on, or have this mummery impo&s;ed upon their ta&s;te and feeling, in conjunction with many of the feeble&s;t worn-out plays; which have neither written or acting merit to up down, without &s;ome &s;uch popular &s;ugar-plumb to &s;weeten them.</P>
<P>Oh SHAKESPEARE, SHAKESPEARE, what a &s;pec|tacle art thou made; how is thy mu&s;e of fire <HI>cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd,</HI> by &s;uch mechanical repre&s;entation; methinks, if thou wert alive again, the &s;hallow ju|&s;tice who pro&s;ecuted thee for &s;tealing veni&s;on would be &s;ooner forgiven, than tho&s;e who make thy great name a bait for gudgeons.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much in warm &s;incerity again&s;t the very nature of what has &s;o much engaged pub|lic attention, we mu&s;t return to MAN and WIFE, only ob&s;erving, that at Covent Garden the pageant was ill regulated, faintly repre&s;ented, and in&s;ipid to the la&s;t degree; however it eked out a piece not longer than &s;ome farces, to the principal part of an evening's entertainment; though the author has &s;ince, with great mode&s;ty, reduced it properly to an after-game; acting upon the &s;ame principle they are guided by in the royal dock-yards, that is of cut|ting
<PB N="389" REF="405">
down a &s;hip or the line, when &s;he does not navigate well, into a frigate.</P>
<P>At the end of the &s;econd act we had &s;ome &s;mall intimation of a plot in favour of Charlotte's mar|riage with colonel Frankly, and now at the begin|ning of the third, we find her prepared for the ma&s;querade; while Lettice, the tru&s;ty confident, appears for the purpo&s;e of deception in the blue Turki&s;h habit, which was mentioned as &s;ignal for Kitchen. From what Charlotte &s;ays in this &s;cene, we find that her Mamma, aiming at high life, has invited the ma&s;ques to her hou&s;e, pre|vious to their going to the amphitheatre; and that from this circum&s;tance, the amu&s;ing Mar|court and Kitchen mu&s;t ari&s;e, while the young lady pur&s;ues her own inclination with the colonel. Sally's part is to make a fool, as &s;he phra&s;es it, of the beau, while Lettice plays upon the Turtle merchant.</P>
<P>Marcourt's approach hurries off Charlotte and Lettice, leaving Sally to play her part, who in a &s;hort &s;oliloquy, profe&s;&s;es great dexterity in the art of fibbing; and comparing her &s;i&s;ter's lovers, in|clines her approbation to the colonel; what pa&s;&s;es between this &s;prightly young &s;prig of intrigue, in point of dialogue, is mere whip &s;yllabub; much froth, very little &s;ub&s;tance. One turn of Mar|court's is well enough, when &s;he throws out&mdash;not very mode&s;tly, &s;ome encomiums upon him: he &s;ays, "What a &s;en&s;ible little creature it is!" The &s;cheme &s;he has been taught to manage, is putting Marcourt upon a wrong &s;cent, by &s;ugge&s;ting that
<PB N="390" REF="406">
her &s;i&s;ter is bent upon deceiving him in favour of Kitchen; therefore advi&s;es &s;trict attention to the lady in the Turki&s;h habit. There is at the con|clu&s;ion of the &s;cene, a little &s;tage-trick of Sally's laughing, as Marcourt is going off, and when he turns to &s;alute her, a&s;&s;uming gravity of counte|tenance, which told extremely well in action, be|ing happily executed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cro&s;s and Lettice now appear; the former in high &s;pirits, fir&s;t from an idea of con&s;equence in the ma&s;ks a&s;&s;embling at her hou&s;e, and next from a &s;uppo&s;ition that her favourite is &s;ure of Charlotte; penurious extravagance and aukward elegance, are admirably touched upon in this &s;peech of the city lady, "Have they &s;tuck the ends of &s;permaceti in the Girandoles; and have you &s;ent to the apo|thecary's for a &s;ufficient quantity of Cream of Tar|tar to make Lemonade?"</P>
<P>Seeing &s;ome ma&s;ks &s;he goes off, and leaves Let|tice to entertain the audience with a &s;oliloquy of very little purport, and le&s;s humour; Kitchen comes forward, to whom the maid di&s;covers her&s;elf, and impo&s;es upon him an in&s;inuation, that Char|lotte's inclination is entirely with him, but that Mrs. Cro&s;s's prejudice infavour of his rival, makes a little policy e&s;&s;ential, Kitchen al&s;o &s;wallows greedily the bait of delu&s;ion, and is going po&s;t ha&s;te to meet his mi&s;tre&s;s near the great booth, but &s;eeing Mar|court at hand, Lettice de&s;ires him to &s;tay; upon the &s;mart's entrance, a &s;light altercation, concern|ing the &s;uppo&s;ed Mi&s;s Charlotte, en&s;uing between the gentlemen; Marcourt not only pre&s;&s;ing by
<PB N="391" REF="407">
words, but u&s;ing force to make Lucy unma&s;k; &s;he &s;creams, which brings Mr. and Mrs. Cro&s;s, the former of whom reproves the forward gallant; the &s;pirit of contradiction between the MAN and WIFE now again exerts it&s;elf pretty bri&s;kly, concerning whether the lady &s;hall unma&s;k or no; however, Lucy removes her concealment; this &s;urpri&s;es Cro&s;s, who a&s;ks for his daughter; &s;ome confu&s;ion en&s;ues, and from what Kitchen has privately intimated, he triumphs over Mrs. Cro&s;s's di&s;appointment&mdash; Here a Mr. Fleece appears, who comes for the very purpo&s;e of telling that Charlotte is married to Colonel Frankly; this Mr. Fleece, we find, was appointed agent to take the hou&s;e to make Char|lotte a pari&s;hioner, and to have the banns of mar|riage publi&s;hed; but was impo&s;ed on by the young lady to act diametrically oppo&s;ite to the in|clination and intention of both her parents; the un|lucky rivals bear their di&s;appointment with patience; but Mrs. Cro&s;s threatens turning her daughter out of doors, which Cro&s;s warmly oppo&s;es, and to thwart his wife, &s;ays, he will receive them with open arms; the happy couple appear next, and matters are agreeably compromi&s;ed&mdash;One expre&s;|&s;ion of Kitchen's we cannot pa&s;s unnoticed; &s;peak|ing of him&s;elf and Marcourt, he &s;ays, "I have been roa&s;ted a little it is true, but not &s;o much as my friend here&mdash;HE GOT INTO THE WHEEL AND TURNED HIMSELF"&mdash;Oh glorious Hibernici&s;m! exactly parallel to Captain O'Blunder's expre&s;&s;ion of not being by when the taylor took mea&s;ure of him for a &s;uit of cloaths; who ever imagined,
<PB N="392" REF="408">
before our author, that a turn&s;pit puppy in office roa&s;ts him&s;elf&mdash;what pity that he did not add, to give the wit additional brilliance, and <HI>ba&s;ted</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon a retro&s;pect of this comedy, if it mu&s;t be called &s;o, we find the fir&s;t act, at lea&s;t the former part of it, animated by laughable bu&s;tle, tho' rather farcical, the latter is &s;atirically plea&s;ant; the &s;econd act begins agreeably, but is afterwards egregiou&s;ly in&s;ipid: the third act con&s;i&s;ts of laborious intricacy, without na|ture to authorize, humour to &s;upport, or incident to gratify the &s;u&s;pence aimed at: the plot is found|ed upon a mo&s;t pitiful device, and unravelled poorly. We find that the author &s;eems unacquainted with ca|nonical hours, which are preci&s;ely ob&s;erved in mar|riages by publication of banns, nay, by licence, un|le&s;s it be &s;pecial; we are pre&s;ented with two cha|racters habited for the ma&s;querade, and hear of others being come; is it probable that they could be thus prepared, when the forenoon was engaged as at the Jubilee, or indeed any where, for a ma&s;ked ball before &s;even o'clock at &s;oone&s;t&mdash;yet Colo|nel Frankly and his bride ju&s;t come from church at this time; though the matrimonial ceremony, under &s;uch circum&s;tances as we mention, cannot be cele|brated unle&s;s between eight and twelve in the fore|noon; perhaps the author might have been led into this mi&s;take, by entering the honourable &s;tate him&s;elf in the evening through &s;pecial authority.</P>
<P>In point of character there is variety, but nothing very original; the dialogue is ea&s;y, and in &s;ome places &s;pirited; the humour rather trite, yet enter|taining;

and, as to the moral, we &s;hall give Mr. COLMAN's words at the conclu&s;ion; "we derive, &s;ays Cro&s;s, &s;peaking of his daughter's marriage, from this incident, one material piece of in&s;truction, that no family can be well governed where there is a di&s;|agreement among&s;t THOSE who are placed at the head of it&mdash;and that nothing is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as har|mony among&s;t THOSE who&s;e intere&s;ts are &s;o inti|mately connected as THOSE of Man and Wife," by the words particularized it will appear this &s;entence is not remarkable for elegance or compactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. COLMAN, in a previous adverti&s;ement, has paid a genteel compliment to the performers for their <HI>great</HI> excellence in the repre&s;entation; this, we think, extremely liberal, con&s;idering him in the double light of manager and author, though we could wi&s;h the word <HI>great</HI> had been omitted; in|deed, we have heard his approbation interpreted dif|ferently; fir&s;t as a de&s;ign to recommend the hou&s;e, &s;econd as a verbal bribe to engage the actors on his &s;ide, in the contention with his brother patentees, and la&s;t, to approve his own great talent in writing for, and adapting characters to the executive facul|ties of each performer; however, we are apt to in|terpret his prai&s;e more ingenuou&s;ly, and &s;hall ju&s;tify in general the idea he thereby inculcates.</P>
<P>Cro&s;s is a peevi&s;h, &s;illy fellow, who after his fir&s;t &s;cene, becomes mighty incon&s;iderable, and an in&s;ipid engine of the plot; Mr. SHUTER being freer from grimace in this character than any other, is ex|tremely de&s;erving of applau&s;e; but we apprehend

the dryne&s;s of humour aimed at, would have found better &s;upport in Mr. YATES.</P>
<P>Marcourt, by Mr. WOODWARD, has not, as we re|member, one touch of Harlequin; his degag&eacute;e pert|ne&s;s is admirably expre&s;&s;ed, and no part that we have ever &s;een was better figured, or better dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Kitchen, who has more novelty and uniformity about him than any other character in the piece, fell mo&s;t happily into the hands of Mr. DUNSTALL, through him nature articulated every line with a|greeable unaffected humour; without grimace or fine&s;&s;e of any &s;ort, he &s;u&s;tained the author becoming|ly, and without one laborious effort gave every in|telligent &s;pectator &s;ingular &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Landlord, who could be little el&s;e than Bonniface in the gout, was hobbled through well enough by Mr. MORRIS: Luke, the waiter, re|ceived great &s;pirit from, and &s;tood much indebted to Mr. LEWES, who&s;e voluble and &s;pirited expre&s;|&s;ion rendered &s;o &s;hort a part very con&s;picuous. Buck and Mr. DAVIS did not di&s;agree, he looked the riotous Bacchanalian well, and expre&s;&s;ed his in|ebriated &s;tate with &s;ome degree of plea&s;antry. Mr. WIGNEL tragedized Snarl &s;o laughably, that, for the few lines he &s;poke, it becomes matter of great doubt, whether he was not the mo&s;t comical per&s;onage of the drama. Mr. QUICK &s;poke the Ho&s;tler well enough, but was far too petit to figure &s;uch a character; Mr. BARNSHAW would have looked it exqui&s;itely.

<P>Mrs. Cro&s;s is as po&s;itive as her hu&s;band, but ra|ther more &s;illy and violent; devoted with ideas contemptibly narrow, to a lavi&s;h imitation of per|&s;ons in high life; fond of what &s;he does not un|der&s;tand, and opiniated of judgment &s;he has not; a perver&s;e wife and indi&s;creet mother; &s;uch are her outlines; however, the picture is but very faint|ly fini&s;hed, it received con&s;iderable animation from that correctne&s;s and vivacity which always di&s;tin|gui&s;hes Mrs. GREEN's performance of &s;uch cha|racters. Charlotte is, con&s;idered in the theatrical view, as mere a trifle as ever hung heavy on the drama; with ju&s;t cunning &s;ufficient to pick up a hu&s;band, and in&s;ipidity enough to &s;et an audience a&s;leep.

<HEAD>ZENOBIA. A TRAGEDY. ANONYMOUS.</HEAD>
<P>OPening the drama with &s;oliloquy, unle&s;s what the character &s;peaks appertains peculiarly to &s;elf, we cannot entirely approve; and what Zelmira of|fers at the beginning of this tragedy, we deem an une&s;&s;ential, faint, trite effort at de&s;cription; what &s;he &s;ays to her hu&s;band Zopiron, concerning the havoc which ambition cau&s;es, is expre&s;&s;ed in terms commendably humane; a mo&s;t hateful picture of Phara&s;manes is given, and we are informed, that he holds in captivity a beauteous dame, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Ariana, for who&s;e virtue Zelmira conceives tender apprehen&s;ions; the entrance of Zenobia is well prepared, by mention of the di&s;tre&s;s her mind appears to wear; and her fainting under a load of &s;orrow when &s;he comes in view, affects the tender mind: there is &s;omething pretty in her &s;en&s;e of obligation for the tender a&s;&s;iduity of her at|tendants, and their di&s;intere&s;ted attachment; but we think them very &s;trange, very improper me&s;&s;engers to &s;upervi&s;e and bring intelligence of the impend|ing battle; it mu&s;t convey an Amazonian idea to &s;uppo&s;e them capable of &s;uch a charge; be&s;ides, Zopiron, who now di&s;appears &s;o oddly, might have either undertaken the matter him&s;elf, or recom|mended a proper me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="414">In the conference between Zenobia and Zelmira, Phara&s;manes's brutal, bloody character, is &s;et in a clearer light, by the direct charge of fratricide, in murdering Mithridates, an amiable monarch, who&s;e virtues, exclu&s;ive of natural ties, &s;hould have &s;ecured him from &s;uch violence; it appears too, that the tyrant illegally holds the crown of Armenia, given to his elde&s;t &s;on Rhadami&s;tus by Mithridates: a crown Phara&s;manes &s;eized by force of arms, pur|&s;uing even the life of his plundered child. On Zel|mira's charging Rhadami&s;tus with the murder of his wife, Zenobia gives a nervous and pathetic ac|count of the affair, from whence we learn that prince was &s;ent when young to Mithridates' court, where an early affection grew between him and Ze|nobia, to whom he was married. At length, dri|ven to de&s;pair by the unnatural rage of Phara&s;|manes, the royal couple determined to &s;eek an a&s;y|lum in death, for which purpo&s;e they plunged into the river Araxes; in the tran&s;port of relation, Ze|nobia, known to Zelmira only as Ariana, &s;lips out her real name, which &s;eems to promi&s;e further ex|planation; but the entrance of Tigranes, an officer and creature of Phara&s;manes &s;tops it.</P>
<P>The appearance of &s;ome captives &s;trikes Zeno|bia with apprehen&s;ion that the Romans have been vanqui&s;hed, but Tigranes informs her they are only &s;ome per&s;ons who were intercepted going to the Ro|man camp, for which the king has &s;entenced them to be impaled alive; the latter end of this line we think liable to objection,
<Q>They &s;uffer death in <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of <HI>torment.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="415">The word <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> &s;eems &s;uperfluou&s;ly annexed to <HI>torment,</HI> as not tending to add any force, but rather furni&s;hing a poverty of idea; there may be mi&s;ery without torment, but there cannot be torment with|out mi&s;ery. Upon viewing the unhappy objects of unrelenting tyranny, Zenobia tenderly recognizes Megi&s;tus, for whom &s;he profe&s;&s;es mo&s;t friendly re|gard, as he does for her, and on the authority of being beloved by Phara&s;manes, &s;he takes him under her protection. This meeting is extremely well conceived, and the cau&s;e of her e&s;teem for the old man judiciou&s;ly concealed.</P>
<P>In the &s;cene between Tigranes and Zelmira we are informed, that Teribazus, the younger &s;on of Pha|ra&s;manes, loves Zenobia; a &s;hort &s;ketch of that young prince's character is given by Tigranes, who afterwards drops a di&s;tant intimation of being him|&s;elf a foe to Zenobia; here Teribazus pre&s;ents him|&s;elf, and makes kind enquiry of Zelmira for Ari|ana: Zenobia comes in upon his words, and en|quires concerning the fate of war, when &s;he is in|formed, that the king has conde&s;cended to treat of peace, and that an amba&s;&s;ador from the Roman camp is to have audience in Phara&s;manes's tent; from this Zenobia cannot draw any pre&s;age in her own favour, however, proceeds to an immediate and warm interce&s;&s;ion for Megi&s;tus, whom &s;he calls <HI>more than father</HI>; &s;he drops al&s;o &s;ome unfavourable hints of Tigranes's officiou&s;ne&s;s in the act of cri|mination; the prince, glad of an occa&s;ion to oblige the object of his affection, promi&s;es not only life but
<PB N="400" REF="416">
liberty to the old man, and reproves Tigranes with con&s;iderable a&s;perity.</P>
<P>This de&s;irable point gained, Zenobia's mental gloom appears for &s;ome time gilded with the en|livening rays of heart-felt &s;atisfaction; in the full &s;low of her feelings, and to account for being &s;o in|tere&s;ted for Megi&s;tus, &s;he reveals her&s;elf at large, and relates how the good old man re&s;cued her, when floated far from Rhadami&s;tus; re&s;cued her ju&s;t ex|piring, from the flood, and with her &s;aved a boy of which &s;he then was pregnant; the remainder of this &s;cene, where &s;he mentions living with Megi&s;tus, &s;eparation from her child, captivity with Phara&s;|manes, and the grief of her hu&s;band lo&s;t, is poeti|cally pathetic, well calculated for capital action, without any &s;train or exaggeration of nature.</P>
<P>That dramatic writers, forty years &s;ince, when actors chaunted according to the flow of ver&s;e, pay|ing more re&s;pect to harmony of expre&s;&s;ion than meaning, &s;hould tag their acts with tho&s;e paltry unnatural clap traps, rhimes, is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing; but for a poet of this day to intrude them upon pub|lic ta&s;te, is what we could not rea&s;onably expect, and mu&s;t therefore blame in this play, e&s;pecially tho&s;e at the end of the fir&s;t act, which are &s;ervilely &s;imilar to one of Andromache's &s;peeches in the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother; we have al&s;o an objection to &s;peaking of &s;pirit, in the &s;tile of a di&s;tinct &s;ex, when the mo&s;t ignorant mu&s;t know, that the corporeal compo&s;ition only, admits &s;uch a di&s;tinction; the pa&s;&s;age runs

<L>Till you &s;hall bid this &s;ad, world weary &s;pirit,</L>
<L>To peaceful regions wing <HI>her</HI> weary flight.</L></Q></P>
<P>There is another line in this &s;cene cen&s;urable, as being both in idea and expre&s;&s;ion exactly &s;imilar to a pa&s;&s;age in Dryden's Virgil; Zenobia, &s;peaking of her hu&s;band's fatal cata&s;trophe, &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;the la&s;t di&s;mal accents</L>
<L>That trembled on thy tongue came bubbling up&mdash;</L></Q>
Speaking of a &s;ea-nymph's departure under water, Dryden has it thus,
<Q>And her la&s;t words came bubbling up in air.</Q></P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, Tigranes pre|&s;ents him&s;elf ruminating, in a &s;hort &s;oliloquy, upon &s;ome terms of reproach, uttered again&s;t him by Teribazus, which occa&s;ions him to declare re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the Prince, marking Zenobia al&s;o as an object of hatred; Phara&s;manes approaches this mini&s;terial tool of tyranny, and like the true man of blood, regrets that propo&s;ed negotiation from the Roman camp, has &s;topped the glorious havoc of impending battle; then enquires, whether the captives have &s;uffered death according to his &s;en|tence; this gives Tigranes's malevolence an oppor|tunity of accu&s;ing Teribazus, by in&s;inuation of &s;u&s;|pending their fate; thus he touches the monarch's impatience, who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in terms of &s;eve|rity again&s;t the Prince, ju&s;t as Zenobia enters, who &s;upplicates in pathetic terms, mercy for the cap|tives; this &s;uit, from an amourous inclination, Phara&s;manes grants; the per&s;ua&s;ion of one, and
<PB N="402" REF="418">
the compliance of the other, are agreeably conduct|ed in this &s;cene; upon mention of Megi&s;tus, as a parent, the monarch propo&s;es not only giving life, but rai&s;ing him to a &s;tate of &s;plendor, which Ze|nobia prettily declines.</P>
<P>Being acquainted by Teribazus that the Roman emba&s;&s;y is arrived, Phara&s;manes, after hinting re|&s;entment to his &s;on, and rhiming out a compliment to the lady, goes off to grant an audience; this gives Teribazus an opportunity of urging again his pa&s;&s;ion to Zenobia, which &s;he admits with re&s;pect, but cannot return; the real cau&s;e of her coldne&s;s is well and naturally concealed; as it occa&s;ions Teribazus fir&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e his father is the happy ri|val, and afterwards leaves him &s;trongly agitated with impa&s;&s;ioned doubt; to &s;ay truth, the Prince is here pictured a kind of Drawcan&s;ir in love, ready to kill any and every body who dare thwart his dar|ling inclination; when he &s;eems left in a &s;trange &s;tate of confu&s;ion, without a &s;yllable of any con&s;e|quence to &s;ay, Zopiron comes in and gives him a &s;hort account of the emba&s;&s;y, and of the &s;enate's re&s;olution concerning Armenia, which Teribazus &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf immediate heir to, rejoices at, and with &s;ome ju&s;tice, though not &s;trict filial duty, wi&s;hes his father's defeat.</P>
<P>One obvious point of enquiry ari&s;es here, how Zopiron &s;hould know what the Roman amba&s;&s;ador has in charge before the public audience has taken place; as he knows not that Flaminius is Rhada|mi&s;tus, nor has had any previous conference with
<PB N="403" REF="419">
him: the general idea of peace is publicly known, but the re&s;erved claim upon Armenia, Phara&s;manes him&s;elf is not acquainted with, till made &s;o by the amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>Tho' it is &s;omething odd, that a repre&s;entative of the Roman &s;enate &s;hould enter upon private con|ver&s;ation with an unknown per&s;on, before he has fulfilled his public charge, yet, we find Rhada|mi&s;tus, in his a&s;&s;umed character, unattended, joins Zopiron, to conver&s;e, as we perceive, upon very inte|re&s;ting matter in an open camp; after a&s;king for the monarch, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in very indelicate terms of Phara&s;manes, which is amazing in one who bears the olive branch; whatever his thoughts might be, &s;ure it mu&s;t be deemed, not only impo|litic, but highly cen&s;urable, to &s;peak in &s;uch a man|ner before one who, for ought he knows, may re|late it to the prejudice of his humane errand; how|ever, he accidentaly lights on a mo&s;t convenient per|&s;on in Zopiron, who advi&s;es him to &s;peak home truth; this &s;eems to awaken Rhadami&s;tus's rea&s;on, which tho' he has already &s;poke in a mo&s;t unre&s;erved, manner, he thinks not &s;o well adapted to Phara&s;|manes's camp; Zopiron's vi&s;age linking a favour|able impre&s;&s;ion, he a&s;ks Zopiron's name and quali|ty, which certainly &s;hould have been known before he had vouch&s;afed conference; on being told that he is delegated to plead the rights of Armenia, Rhadami&s;tus &s;eems to have heard of him, and men|tions his own real name without revealing him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="420">Zopiron profe&s;&s;ing warm attachment to his law|ful prince, though unknown, and even &s;uppo&s;ed dead, he receives information of the unhappy youth's being alive; here Rhadami&s;tus gives a &s;trong, lively and affecting picture of his own wretchedne&s;s, and mentions Zenobia in a melting manner; but, when the author throws him into a &s;woon, we are &s;urprized at the mi&s;placed extrava|gance of pa&s;&s;ion, which repre&s;ents the prince rather as a child than a hero, incapable of checking that grief which unre&s;trained &s;o palpably tends to &s;et a|&s;ide the di&s;gui&s;e he thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to wear; be|&s;ides, falling and grovling about the &s;tage on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, is rather a mean theatrical trick, than any flight of nature; a kind of frenzy &s;ucceeds the fainting fit, merely calculated for action, without any trace of propriety; from this Rhadami&s;tus di&s;|covers him&s;elf, and relates his de&s;ign of peri&s;hing with Zenobia, but that chance, and the humanity of &s;ome Romans, who had found him inanimate on the Araxes' banks, had pre&s;erved him to toil through a life of woe; the a&s;&s;i&s;tance promi&s;ed by Rome on knowing his real character is mentioned; on hearing that the Armenians con&s;ider his brother Teribazus as heir to their crown, his grief makes a &s;trange propo&s;ition of yielding to another what the Romans are generou&s;ly endeavouring to recover for him; in &s;hort, this &s;cene, which concludes with a gingling re&s;olution of &s;colding Phara&s;manes, is extravagant in &s;ome parts, flat in others, and much too tedious upon the whole; we think al&s;o,
<PB N="405" REF="421">
it might have been much more happily introduced after than before the fir&s;t &s;cene of the next act.</P>
<P>When Phara&s;manes receives, on his throne, Rha|dami&s;tus, as the Roman amba&s;&s;ador, we find the former entertains mo&s;t contemptuous notions of re|publicans. However, his expre&s;&s;ions are tolerably decent till Rhadami&s;tus, forgetting his peaceable er|rand, and indulging an ungovernable &s;pirit of &s;peak|ing ill-timed truth, offends him. The monarch, with great colour of ju&s;tice, fires at reproachful ac|cu&s;ations; and hence ari&s;es verbal contention, un|worthy of, and di&s;graceful to private gentlemen, much more, &s;uch exalted characters. Phara&s;manes, contrary to the law of nations, draws upon the brawling amba&s;&s;ador, and Rhadami&s;tus urges his fury by an unlimited licence of expre&s;&s;ion. We much approve the following pa&s;&s;age relative to Mi|thridates' death:
<Q><L>The hand of heav'n</L>
<L>Shook from the bla&s;ted tree the wither'd fruit,</L></Q>
But at the &s;ame time cannot help &s;uppo&s;ing it bor|row'd from a much more beautiful one to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &s;poken by Aegeon, in the la&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act of OEdipus. The whole conference, now before us, is a mo&s;t indelicate piece of politi|cal &s;quabble, leaving matters nearly in the &s;tate they were before it took place.</P>
<P>Zenobia, and Magi&s;tus, now appear to di&s;cu&s;s a tender point, the &s;afety and &s;ituation of her infant &s;on. Maternal anxiety, and faithful attachment, are plea&s;ingly &s;et forth. Impatient to &s;ee her child, Ze|nobia
<PB N="406" REF="422">
propo&s;es flying from Phara&s;manes's camp; but Megi&s;tus objects to the danger of &s;uch a mea|&s;ure, and prudentially hints that revealing her&s;elf to the amba&s;&s;ador of Rome is a more probable me|thod of an&s;wering her purpo&s;e; the &s;ugge&s;tion &s;trikes her, and furni&s;hes a fre&s;h gleam of comfort. Their conver&s;ation is interrupted by Tigranes, who comes as me&s;&s;enger from the king, to know when Zeno|bia will make her royal admirer happy, by marri|age; this rou&s;es her indignation, which &s;he vents in &s;pirited terms. Her refu&s;al is imputed, by Tigra|nes, to a prejudice in favour of Teribazus, which, however, &s;he di&s;claims, and leaves him with &s;ome &s;tinging ob&s;ervations on his own ba&s;e character, which makes him, afre&s;h, declare his intention of working her ruin. To him Rhadami&s;tus approaches, who &s;omewhat cooled him&s;elf, &s;uppo&s;es the king's in|temperance may, by this time, be moderated al&s;o. His &s;entiments are very pacific; but Tigranes a&s;|&s;ures him of vindictive re&s;olutions upon the &s;ide of Phara&s;manes; however, promi&s;es to convey the prince's humane &s;entiments to his royal ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In a &s;ucceeding &s;oliloquy, we perceive nature checking Rhadami&s;tus, for waging war again&s;t his father, though a cruel one; apprehen&s;ion of meet|ing, and perhaps de&s;troying, an unknown brother, in battle, al&s;o &s;hakes him: During this agitation of mind, Teribazus joins him; and utters, in his fir&s;t &s;peech, this &s;trange accumulation of epithets, where|in the ju&s;t gradation of climax is forgot;
<Q>A wretched, ruin'd, mi&s;erable prince</Q>
<PB N="407" REF="423">
Be&s;ides the di&s;&s;onance of four <HI>r</HI>'s jarring in this line, what occa&s;ion, after telling us that he is wretched, is there for adding the word mi&s;erable; but our author &s;eems fond of this mode of expre&s;&s;ion. In the progre&s;s of this conference we are again, there|fore, &s;uperfluou&s;ly made acquainted with Phara&s;ma|nes's crimes, upon Teribazus's mentioning Rhada|mi&s;tus with affection, though an unknown brother. Sentiments of tender nature ari&s;e; and, as Flaminius, the latter propo&s;es a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the former; who however declares, that filial duty will not &s;uffer him to a&s;&s;ail, with violence, even a tyrannic parent. One material apprehen&s;ion he mentions, that of lo&s;ing the lovely captive, Ariana; wherefore he reque&s;ts Rhadami&s;tus to convey her from the camp; this fa|vour is readily and cordially promi&s;ed, with an in|treaty, that Teribazus will al&s;o retreat to the Roman refuge; this is declined, and he goes off to &s;end the idol of his affection, while he watchfully prevents any interruption of her interview with the amba&s;|&s;ador.</P>
<P>Megi&s;tus now leads on Zenobia, and a few lines are &s;poke before Rhadami&s;tus fully perceives what object &s;tands before him; tran&s;ported doubt, for &s;ome time, agitates him, after he has recognized her features and per&s;on, during which, &s;he per|ceives, knows, and yet doubts al&s;o, the hu&s;band &s;he has long thought dead.</P>
<P>The&s;e meetings are &s;o frequent in tragedies, the Mourning Bride, Oroonoko, &amp;c. that the author mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s uncommon abilities who &s;trikes out any
<PB N="408" REF="424">
thing new or more affecting than we have &s;een. Whatever po&s;&s;ibility there is of working &s;uch an ef|fect, we cannot compliment the piece before us, in that light; the prince, as u&s;ual, &s;tands in an atti|tude, and the lady faints; be&s;ides, the incident hangs too long upon attention. When the faithful pair are realized to each other, Zenobia pre&s;ents Megi&s;|tus as the pre&s;erver of her&s;elf and child, upon which occa&s;ion, we think Rhadami&s;tus too languid. How much &s;tronger is the glow of love and grati|tude in Oroonoko, who forgives even the villain who has kidnapped him, as being the means of finding his beloved Imoinda? Without forceable ac|tion this &s;cene, e&s;pecially as a child is in the ca&s;e, is much fainter than any one we know, of a &s;imilar na|ture. Indeed, the poet &s;eems con&s;cious that his mu&s;e flaps her pinions heavily, by hurrying the act to a conclu&s;ion. Tigranes being &s;een, Rhadami&s;tus goes off to meet him; Megi&s;tus briefly mentions the plea&s;ing accompli&s;hment of his prayers, in Zenobia's happine&s;s; and &s;he promi&s;es him &s;ingular regard. &mdash;Would &s;he did not deliver her&s;elf in rhime.</P>
<P>Act the fourth commences with the two princely brothers; Teribazus thanking Rhadami&s;tus for his promi&s;ed care of the captive, and warning him again&s;t any amorous impre&s;&s;ions. This precaution occa&s;ions &s;ome dubious expre&s;&s;ions to fall, which alarm the &s;u&s;picion, and enflame the impetuo&s;ity, of Teribazus, who, neverthele&s;s, cools upon being de|&s;ired to continue the beauteous object within his amo|rous father's reach, and chu&s;ing rather to tru&s;t Ro|man

integrity, reque&s;ts again the conductive care of Flaminius. Here Tigranes enters, and gives in|formation that the king is approaching to have a private interview with the amba&s;&s;ador; this &s;ends off Teribazus, and the monarch &s;oon appears.</P>
<P>After a few preparative lines, Phara&s;manes men|tions that Rhadami&s;tus is alive, to Flaminius' know|ledge; therefore, demands his head from Paulinus the Roman general's hands. Here the tyrant, if po&s;&s;ible, gives his character a deeper tinge of guilt; and Rhadami&s;tus, though in vain, expo&s;tulates with him on the principles of parental tenderne&s;s and ge|neral humanity; the&s;e failing to touch his inexora|ble heart, the parley is broken off, and vengeance denounced on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Phara&s;manes, determined on the deci&s;ion of war, re&s;olves, during the intermediate hours of peace, to pro&s;ecute his impa&s;&s;ionate purpo&s;e on Ariana, and a&s;ks Tigranes, if &s;he has con&s;ented to make him happy; on being informed of her peremptory, nay &s;cornful, refu&s;al, he declares, that love it&s;elf &s;hall be his &s;lave. However, a gleam of generous feeling &s;hoots acro&s;s the gloom of his du&s;ky mind, and lights him to the milder path of per&s;ua&s;ion; for which purpo&s;e he orders Megi&s;tus, whom he &s;uppo|&s;es the father of Zenobia, to be brought before him; the old man, at his entrance, &s;peaks in the &s;tile of he&s;itative apprehen&s;ion, to which the monarch re|plies in terms of friendly profe&s;&s;ion, for &s;ake of his imagined daughter. Speaking of the di&s;tre&s;s which
<PB N="410" REF="426">
preys upon Zenobia's mind, Megi&s;tus mentions an ab&s;ent hu&s;band, long &s;eparated, as the cau&s;e of her woe. This alarms the monarch, who declares he will remove, by violence, &s;uch an impediment to his own uncontrolable pa&s;&s;ion; and de&s;ires an immediate interview with his beauteous captive, ordering Megi&s;tus to conduct her, which charge he re&s;pectfully declines; and when urged by Phara&s;|manes, with the glaring argument of royal &s;plendor, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following agreeable pa&s;|&s;age, which, without much originality, has yet &s;ome &s;hare of poetical and philo&s;ophical merit; it might naturally flow from an humble &s;tation, yet it is by no means unworthy an exalted mind:
<Q><L>Oh! not for me &s;uch &s;plendor&mdash;I have lived</L>
<L>My humble days in virtuous poverty;</L>
<L>To tend my flock, to watch each ri&s;ing flow'r,</L>
<L>Each herb, each plant, that drinks the morning dew;</L>
<L>And lift my prayers to the ju&s;t Gods on high.&mdash;</L>
<L>The&s;e were my habits, the&s;e my cares.&mdash;</L>
<L>The&s;e hands &s;ufficed to an&s;wer my de&s;ires,</L>
<L>And, having nought, yet nought was wanting to me.</L></Q></P>
<P>Phara&s;manes, ill calculated to parley with his own turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, contemns cool rea&s;on, and threat|ens the mo&s;t fatal mea&s;ures, if his de&s;ires are not complied with, leaving Megi&s;tus to ruminate there|on. The old man might have been furni&s;hed with an excellent &s;oliloquy; and, indeed, one of eight or ten lines &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to place the exit of Pha|ra&s;manes, and the entrance of Zenobia at a proper di&s;tance from each other; as it is, &s;he treads upon the heels of incen&s;ed royalty. The prince&s;s hurries
<PB N="411" REF="427">
off her faithful guardian, appointing a place of meet|ing, that &s;u&s;picion may not ari&s;e from their being &s;een together. Teribazus enters, upon the old man's departure, and renews his &s;uit to Zenobia, which &s;he interrupts, and overturns, by a mo&s;t unaccount|able declaration, that the idol of her love is in the camp. Nay, upon further que&s;tion, &s;he &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ingly, and we may add incon&s;i&s;tently, de|clares, without re&s;erve, Flaminius is that rival. From what precedes, it would &s;eem as if &s;he had intere&s;ted the prince to recommend her flight to the Roman camp under care of the Roman amba&s;&s;ador. That flight being ready for execution, how is it po&s;|&s;ible &s;he &s;hould, &s;o palpably, &s;trike out the means of prevention; nay, even the hazard of, either di&s;co|vering Rhadami&s;tus, or, &s;ubjecting his life to dan|ger, from a tempe&s;t of jealou&s;y rai&s;ed in his bro|ther's brea&s;t. Yet, &s;uch is her conduct; and Rha|dami&s;tus, entering upon the di&s;covery, is ju&s;tly ac|cu&s;ed by Teribazus. The dilemma Zenobia has reduced her&s;elf and hu&s;band to, is manife&s;t, as in this bungled &s;cene &s;he &s;peaks but two lines and a half, and tho&s;e with little or no meaning.</P>
<P>Teribazus, though almo&s;t frenzied with rage, &s;o far remembers the &s;acred character of an amba&s;&s;a|dor, that he po&s;tpones his re&s;entment to the next day's battle. This is polite, and generous; but how can we account for his leaving the woman he loves with a profe&s;&s;ed rival, who is, as he knows, going to quit the camp, and has his own reque&s;t, to take the fair one with him. How to reconcile
<PB N="412" REF="428">
&s;uch contrarieties we cannot tell, and &s;uppo&s;e no|thing could urge an intelligent author into them, but the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and penury of plot; or, an implicit compliance with Mr. Bays's maxim, that to elevate and &s;urprize is eligible at any rate.</P>
<P>Soon after Teribazus goes off, Zopiron enters, and ha&s;tens the departure of Rhadami&s;tus, with Zenobia; who &s;carce di&s;appears, when Phara&s;ma|nes, with his ob&s;equious Tigranes, approach. The monarch declares his intention, of abiding the event of war, and &s;ends for his &s;on, Teribazus; to whom, on his appearance, he urges an accu&s;ation of giving countenance to his foes; this the prince denies with becoming &s;pirit and re&s;pect. On a &s;econd charge, of thwarting his father's amorous inclination, he di&s;claims any attachment to Zenobia, and points out ambition as the pre&s;ent ruler of his heart. Ti|granes, who was di&s;patched to &s;ee that the Roman amba&s;&s;ador had left the camp, returns; and informs Phara&s;manes, that Zenobia and Megi&s;tus are fled with the amba&s;&s;ador: This rou&s;es the tyrant, who orders a pur&s;uit; which point of &s;ervice the irrita|ted Teribazus takes upon him&s;elf, con&s;iderably in the Quixote &s;tile; not in re&s;pect of words, but the incon&s;i&s;tency of the behaviour. To &s;ay truth, there is a laughable mixture of con&s;equence and weakne&s;s, rage and childi&s;hne&s;s, &s;et forth in the monarch al&s;o; who&s;e conclu&s;ion of the act is as much below the temper of mind, he has hitherto &s;hewn, as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="429">At the commencement of the fifth act, Phara&s;ma|nes pre&s;ents him&s;elf to us, in a &s;tate of agitated re|flection; jealou&s;y and vengeance fire his imagina|tion, to a de&s;perate re&s;olution, when Teribazus brings him the agreeable intelligence, that he overtook, and has, after faint re&s;i&s;tance, made pri&s;oners the fugi|tives. They are brought on chained, and &s;u&s;tain, with becoming fortitude, threats of a &s;anguinary nature, from the enraged monarch. Rhadami&s;tus throws out a hint to his brother, that he will repent the forward zeal which has brought them into &s;uch a &s;ituation. Teribazus, wild with re&s;entment, hav|ing heard Zenobia declare the &s;uppo&s;ed Flaminius her hu&s;band, treats his brother with di&s;dain, and vows eternal ho&s;tility with Rome. Rhadami&s;tus, pleading the priviledge of his &s;tation for &s;afety, is an&s;wered by Phara&s;manes, that he has forfeited all title to re&s;pect and protection. Zenobia remon|&s;trates, in favour of her hu&s;band, with force and feeling; which rather &s;eems to precipitate his fate. Nothing can be more languid than Rhadami&s;tus's behaviour through this whole &s;cene; when dragged off to execution, his wife &s;oftens into &s;upplication, and, on Phara&s;manes's declaration, that her compli|ance with his amorous de&s;ires, is the only path to mercy, &s;he very pathetically offers her infant &s;on, as a plea for milder treatment; finding the monarch inexorable, &s;he gives full &s;cope to the di&s;traction of grief: here Teribazus appears, and &s;eems di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;ooth her, notwith&s;tanding he has been the cau&s;e of the pungent woe, &s;he feels.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="430">On the hint, that Flaminius is his brother Rhada|mi&s;tus, Teribazus entertains &s;trong and natural &s;ur|prize; and, with a great deal of ju&s;tice, a&s;ks, why &s;o important a &s;ecret was kept from him; on Ze|nobia's an&s;wer, which contains but a weak apology, the prince re&s;olves, affectionately, to &s;ave his bro|ther, for which purpo&s;e he goes off. Zenobia, however, does not draw any favourable con&s;equence from this unexpected turn; but &s;eems to think her hu&s;band's fall is inevitable; which melancholy re|flection is confirmed by Zopiron, who brings intel|ligence, that Rhadami&s;tus is leading forth to execu|tion; this, very alarming cri&s;is, in&s;pires Zenobia with a de&s;perate remedy, which &s;he ha&s;tens to put in practice; but leaves the audience in doubt what it may be.</P>
<P>Rhadami&s;tus appearing guarded, Teribazus joins him, and enters into a private conference. The ex|planation of affinity gives the former a fine oppor|tunity of manife&s;ting fraternal tenderne&s;s, by grant|ing unlimited forgivene&s;s to the per&s;on who has ef|fected his ruin. Indeed, the picture he gives of his own di&s;ingenuous policy is a powerful exculpation of Teribazus, and places him in the faire&s;t point of view that their conduct and circum&s;tances will admit. However, his brother, on the propo&s;al of a re&s;cue, even at the expence of their inhuman father's life, &s;hews true filial dignity, mo&s;t amiable per&s;evering tenderne&s;s, in rejecting the idea of pre&s;erving his own life, and even his love, by the &s;acrifice of a parent. Tigranes, with a fre&s;h &s;entence from Pha|ra&s;manes,
<PB N="415" REF="431">
orders the guards to plunge Rhadami&s;tus into a dungeon, where his generous brother deter|termines to attend him.</P>
<P>Tigranes, in a &s;hort &s;oliloquy, after the princes are departed, &s;eems to plan great matters for him|&s;elf, but is &s;o much the embrio of a villain, that we &s;carce know what to make of him; Zopiron now appears with a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Rhadami&s;tus's &s;en|tence, by order of the king, and, as he &s;ays, the queen; mention of the queen &s;urprizes Tigranes, from who&s;e enquiry we find, that Zenobia has con|&s;ented to be, and actually is, by a very &s;hort cere|mony, the wife of Phara&s;manes; Zopiron's account of the tran&s;action, has &s;ome &s;hare of merit, and gives to critical perception a gleam of the cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>When the royal pair are di&s;covered, the monarch expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in affectionate terms, while Zeno|bia's words wear a cold and my&s;terious gloom; on &s;olliciting freedom, and &s;afe conduct to his friends, for the Roman amba&s;&s;ador, Phara&s;manes's impe|tuous, brutal temper kindles, and mention of an interview makes him not only rever&s;e the pardon he &s;o lately granted into a fre&s;h order for immediate execution, but al&s;o treat his unhappy bride with the mo&s;t &s;evere indignity; till at length by the opera|tion of poi&s;on he has drank from his nuptial cup, his feelings are changed from rage to agony; Ze|nobia's triumph at his approaching fate, is mo&s;t cer|tainly founded in ju&s;tice, and affords an excellent tran&s;ition in acting, but we mu&s;t contend that it &s;a|vours rather too much of ma&s;culine ferocity, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="416" REF="432">
in tho&s;e lines of exultation &s;he &s;peaks after Phara&s;manes dies.</P>
<P>Upon the entrance of Rhadami&s;tus, freed from captivity and danger, he flies with rapture to the embrace of his beloved Zenobia; who &s;eems, like Romeo, to lo&s;e awhile the remembrance of poi&s;on in rapture; Rhadami&s;tus in one line pays the tribute of filial &s;orrow to an unworthy father, and the next moment warmly applauds Zenobia for the virtuous action of murdering him.</P>
<P>When Zenobia feels the deadly draught working in her veins, &s;ome pathetic &s;trokes occur, but &s;o in|ferior to tho&s;e of the la&s;t &s;cene of Romeo and Juliet, which they evidently, though faintly re&s;emble, that compari&s;on &s;hews them in a trifling point of view; our heroine's conclu&s;ion would lo&s;e much of its ef|fect but for the mention of her child: Rhadami&s;tus is very feebly &s;upported for his circum&s;tances, and making the impetuous, hot-headed Teribazus, a|mid&s;t &s;uch a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, woe, and the di&s;|appointment of his own heart, draw the cool, mo|ral inference which the author fixes from his piece, &s;eems rather a compliment to the performer, than &s;trictne&s;s of propriety, which would have given the conclu&s;ive &s;peech to Megi&s;tus, or rather Zopiron, as the character lea&s;t intere&s;ted, con&s;equently fitte&s;t for &s;peculative remarks: the &s;ix lines of rhime are al&s;o as impoveri&s;hed jingle as ever we met in any decent piece.</P>
<P>The unities of this tragedy are well pre&s;erved, there are &s;ome &s;urprizes, and many intere&s;ting events
<PB N="417" REF="433">
in the plot, which is well conducted for &s;tage bu&s;i|ne&s;s; the ver&s;ification is neither elegant nor flowing, however, by ri&s;ing very little above mea&s;ured pro&s;e, it has no taint of bomba&s;t; the &s;entiments are trite, yet in &s;everal places happily applied, and we rea|dily admit, that there are many &s;trong appeals to the tender pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;omuch that we know &s;everal pieces much more poetical and correct, which can|not draw &s;o many tears; what light it &s;hews human nature in, and how the great purpo&s;e of in&s;truction is fulfilled, we &s;hall di&s;cover by an inve&s;tigation of the characters.</P>
<P>Phara&s;manes is one of the mo&s;t compleat, royal villains we remember to have met with, capable of crimes thoroughly attrocious, without one generous feeling; his love is evidently &s;en&s;ual, his fame bar|barity; the &s;anguine &s;lave of ambition, with every other hateful, turbulent pa&s;&s;ion; he moves before us, from beginning to end, an object of con&s;ummate dete&s;tation; the author, intending to exhibit nature in a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t depravity, has well fulfilled his de&s;ign. As to the acting of this obnoxious mo|narch, there are opportunities of exerting con&s;idera|ble talents to advantage, and we imagine Mr. MOS|SOP's executive powers might make him a very con&s;picuous character, while Mr. AICKIN &s;tands deficient both in dignity of deportment and extent of voice, which latter defect is rendered more palpa|ble, by a laborious wildne&s;s of exertion, by vain, un|cultivated attempts; in &s;hort, he reminds us of an unbroken &s;teed, which is con&s;tantly upon the grand
<PB N="418" REF="434">
paw, without any grace or propriety of motion; a little re&s;traint would throw him into more agree|able regularity, and mend his paces much.</P>
<P>Rhadami&s;tus is an hone&s;t man and tender hu&s;band, in point of filial re&s;pect al&s;o he is commendable, but as to heroi&s;m he cuts a very poor figure, being, as is apparent, timorous and di&s;ingenuous: in the&s;e failings he &s;eems to be a mere tool of the plot, which greatly depends in its pre&s;ent form on his cen&s;ura|ble conduct. The part was indi&s;putably written for Mr. BARRY, who&s;e performance happily &s;u&s;tains the author, wherever he has done ju&s;tice to him&s;elf; but as many of the &s;cenes manife&s;t great inequality, we are not to be &s;urprized, that capital abilities in &s;uch places, &s;hould &s;o far border on in&s;ipidity as to pall; one third of this character omitted in action, would render him more intere&s;ting to an audience, and more advantageous to the performer.</P>
<P>Teribazus, we may ju&s;tly &s;tile, the &s;quib and cracker of tragedy, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an undi&s;gui&s;ed, gene|rous and affectionate heart, yet precipitated by a violent degree of fretful impatience; there is an oddity of compo&s;ition in this impetuous prince which Mr. HOLLAND delineated with ma&s;terly exe|cution; his tran&s;itions were rapid, and his expre&s;|&s;ion forceable; that power of voice which on many occa&s;ions he was too lavi&s;h of, here operated plea|&s;ingly, and made &s;ound literally an echo to the &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. PALMER appears in the &s;ituation of an un|&s;kilful rider on a high mettled hor&s;e; the part runs
<PB N="419" REF="435">
away with him, and he is as near tumbling heels over head as po&s;&s;ible. We wi&s;h, from real regard to this ri&s;ing performer, that he would, before habit takes too &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, clap a check rein on his expre&s;&s;ion, for it is a &s;trict, critical truth, that being under is better than over the mark, and that many natural deficiencies are &s;oftened by a prudent limitation; &s;pirit &s;hould enliven, but not wage war with propriety.</P>
<P>Megi&s;tus is a very amiable per&s;onage, humane and parental in his attachments, humble in de&s;ires, and re&s;olute in danger; we think the poet might have made him much more con&s;iderable, however, as Mr. HAVARD, far in the decline of life, was de&s;igned for the part, it was probably adopted in point of length and feelings to his impaired faculties; it is certain, that gentleman did him great ju&s;tice, a ten|der, &s;en&s;ible placidity of countenance and expre&s;&s;ion, gave the &s;entiments due effect.</P>
<P>Mr. JEFFERSON, who has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the old man, does not affect us &s;o much as his prede|ce&s;&s;or, though neither languid nor di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Zopiron &s;eems little more than a filler up of the drama, he appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome virtues, but has no opportunity of exerting any, and what he &s;ays, through the whole play, is of &s;o little &s;ignificance, that we are &s;urprized Mr. PACKER can walk thro' him without &s;etting the audience a&s;leep; this is one of many make&s;hift characters which, if totally o|mitted, would occa&s;ion little or no deficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="436">Tigranes &s;eems to be a thorough paced pupil of tyranny, ready for all the dirty work his ma&s;ter can &s;ugge&s;t, teeming with mi&s;chief, which, however, he cannot bring about. Mr. HURST does him no in|ju&s;tice, except by a Mo&s;&s;opian pompo&s;ity of utter|ance, which hangs too much about him in every cha|racter he performs: we think proper to intimate, that every imitative performer is &s;ure to catch the defects of that per&s;on he aims at, much &s;ooner than his beauties; and, as the latter, at &s;econd hand, grow much fainter, &s;o the former ri&s;e to a &s;tronger degree of di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Zelmira is as water gruel a character as her hus|band Zopiron, and affords no opportunity for cutting a con&s;picuous figure; being no more than a foil, &s;he cannot ri&s;e above the agreeable, and this Mrs. W. BARRY reaches.</P>
<P>Zenobia engro&s;&s;es more approbation than any o|ther character; as a prince&s;s, wife and mother, &s;he commands our applau&s;e; her &s;ituations are well varied, alarming and intere&s;ting; we heartily con|cur with the author, that Mrs. BARRY gives her many additional charms, that her action is a kind of Promethian heat to the prince&s;s, and that we have not lately &s;een &s;o &s;trong a degree of pa&s;&s;ion and pa|thos exhibited.</P>
<P>This tragedy, with adequate performers may, nay mu&s;t always plea&s;e on the &s;tage, but as to pri|vate peru&s;al, we think it will afford very little plea|&s;ure, and le&s;s in&s;truction.</P>

<P>Cymon's falling a&s;leep, amid&s;t exhilerating enter|tainment, is a powerful proof of dulne&s;s; on be|ing awakened, he expre&s;&s;es a de&s;ire of going, and makes a pretty allu&s;ion, in &s;ong, of his own ca&s;e to that of an encaged linnet; at length, Urganda, by way of working on his gratitude, grants him li|berty, and gives him a magical no&s;egay which can|not create, but is capable of improving pa&s;&s;ion; he receives both with a kind of puerile joy, and con|cludes the fir&s;t act with a &s;ong on liberty, very much in the namby pamby &s;train, but well enough for a &s;impleton.</P>
<P>Two &s;hepherde&s;&s;es pre&s;ent them&s;elves at the be|ginning of the &s;econd act, one in full fret at being for&s;aken, the other offering conciliatory advice; Ur|ganda's fruitle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, though an enchantre&s;s, is mentioned; from further explanation, it appears, that one Sylvia is the object of jealou&s;y, as her
<PB N="424" REF="440">
beauty &s;eems to be an object of general admiration among the rural &s;wains; after a very womani&s;h re&s;olution of making her as unea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, de|riving plea&s;ure from her pain, the &s;i&s;ters are acco&s;t|ed by Linco, a merry blade, who gives a &s;pecimen of his di&s;po&s;ition in a &s;pirited &s;ong. His contempt of &s;ighing lovers is well expre&s;&s;ed; his contra&s;ting of Sylvia, who &s;huns gallants as indu&s;triou&s;ly as other girls follow them, is al&s;o plea&s;ing; Linco's &s;econd &s;ong is not a bad receipt for di&s;engaged peace of mind, but as to the poetry it is as moderate as may be.</P>
<P>Upon being told by the angry &s;hepherde&s;s that his pre&s;cription wont effect her cure, he thinks her ca&s;e de&s;erves only to be laughed at; in a few lines further he mentions, that Sylvia has &s;educed Da|mon her &s;i&s;ter's &s;wain; here the &s;cale is turned, and &s;he who preached patience, being now touched her|&s;elf, breaths terrible threats; at length, both females are &s;o di&s;concerted at Linco's light treatment of their &s;erious concerns, that they go off and leave him to enjoy his laughter in another &s;ong, which has more &s;pirit than poetry, more &s;ound than meaning.</P>
<P>Merlin next appears, and in &s;oliloquy acquaints us, that he has &s;own the &s;eeds of mutual affection between Sylvia and Cymon; by a touch of his ma|gical wand he communicates to a ba&s;ket of flowers, the power of in&s;piring the heart with love, then goes off uttering the &s;ame line concerning Cymon's cure he pronounced to Urganda in the fir&s;t act;
<PB N="425" REF="441">
&s;oon as he di&s;appears, the &s;imple prince approaches with his bird, to which he determines giving liber|ty, having obtained the like happine&s;s him&s;elf. On &s;eeing Sylvia as &s;he lies repo&s;ed on a bank, he con|fe&s;&s;es a&s;toni&s;hment, and in a &s;peech of much natural &s;implicity, gives us to under&s;tand, that new &s;en&s;a|tions have entered his mind; the air he &s;ings is in a &s;uitable &s;tile, and affords very good opportunity for action.</P>
<P>Sylvia's waking occa&s;ions a very plea&s;ing and dif|fident interview; her &s;ong is pretty, and the a&s;to|ni&s;hed he&s;itation between her and Cymon has an agreeable, natural, effect; but is rather too great a &s;imilitude to that of Hypolita and Dorinda in DRY|DEN's TEMPEST.</P>
<P>The progre&s;&s;ive explanation of their artle&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion is very happily conducted; her giving, as a token of remembrance, the no&s;egay enchanted by Merlin, and his exchanging that pre&s;ented him by Urganda, are well conceived incidents for continu|ing and embarra&s;&s;ing the plot. The duet, which concludes the &s;econd act, turns upon a fanciful ap|plication of incon&s;tancy to fading flowers, which charm the &s;en&s;es for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, and &s;oon grow obnoxious.</P>
<P>Urganda enters with her confidant at the beginning of the third act, making enquiry after Cymon; and is again rallied by Fatima for &s;o eagerly pur&s;uing &s;uch worthle&s;s game. We apprehend this conve|nient lady's &s;cheme for making matters ea&s;y, by
<PB N="426" REF="442">
the enchantre&s;s's marrying Merlin and retaining Cy|mon as a gallant, is too licentious: Be&s;ides, Mer|lin mu&s;t be as little of a conjuror as thou&s;ands of his neighbours, not to find out his own cuckoldom.</P>
<P>Cymon's rapturous entrance with a no&s;egay occa|&s;ions a very apt mi&s;take in Urganda, which is, that the young man has at la&s;t conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for her, according to her wi&s;hes; hence &s;he conceives the mo&s;t agreeable &s;en&s;ations, and on the conclu&s;ion of a very rapturous air, which he &s;ings, comes in his view; at &s;ight of &s;o hateful and terrible an ob|ject, con&s;cious too of the danger her re&s;entment is pregnant with, he endeavours to hide Sylvia's no&s;e|gay; and when Urganda urges an explanation of the change that appears in him, he prevaricates, till being forced to &s;hew the flowers, the enraged en|chantre&s;s di&s;covers her mi&s;take, and by di&s;&s;embled mildne&s;s makes enquiry how he came by the pre|&s;ent; Fatima cau&s;es him to &s;lip out that it was gi|ven by a female, while Urganda, to make ven|geance more &s;ure, not only &s;tops further inqui&s;ition, but gives tran&s;ported Cymon full liberty to follow his own inclinations; however, after he goes off, &s;he di&s;covers very vindictive feelings, and having ordered Fatima to watch his motions, makes her exit with a &s;ong of furious import.</P>
<P>Sylvia now appears, at the door of Dorcas's cot|tage, with Cymon's pre&s;ent in her hand. In a &s;o|liloquy and two airs, &s;he confe&s;&s;es &s;ingular &s;ati&s;|faction, &s;omewhat mingled with occa&s;ional doubt.
<PB N="427" REF="443">
Linco li&s;tens while &s;he is &s;inging, and pays a deli|cate compliment, not only to the harmony of her voice, but the innocence of her di&s;po&s;ition. She is rather &s;tartled at Linco's overhearing her private thoughts upon &s;uch a &s;ubject; he acquaints her, that &s;he is to appear before the deputy governor, to an&s;wer &s;ome complaints which have been lodged again&s;t her by a &s;hepherde&s;s; however, he promi&s;es his friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Ignorant of any crime, but that of being too hand&s;ome, &s;he readily con&s;ents to attend his &s;ummons.</P>
<P>Dorcas, a deaf old woman, in who&s;e care Sylvia had been left, appears, and expre&s;&s;es &s;everal jealous apprehen&s;ions concerning her charge; but upon Sylvia's apparent willingne&s;s to go, and Linco's promi&s;e of protection, &s;he agrees. The old wo|man's affection is well de&s;cribed, and, from what &s;he &s;ays, Sylvia's identity appears doubtful. Dor|cas's &s;ong on the danger young inexperienced fe|males &s;tand expo&s;ed to in the&s;e days, compared with the time of her own youth, is truly humo|rous: However, we doubt whether there ever was an age of ab&s;olute general con&s;tancy in love; but &s;atire makes it a rule, to prefer things pa&s;t to the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Dorus, the magi&s;trate, hearing a &s;hepherde&s;s, and promi&s;ing redre&s;s of her complaint, is next pro|duced; his wor&s;hip, in a very few lines, exhibits a|morous inclinations, which the female, either through fear or cunning, &s;eems to favour, artfully introdu|cing
<PB N="428" REF="444">
Sylvia's name; again&s;t whom, being wound up by the pre&s;ent complainant, he utters &s;evere threats. Linco entering while Dorus is ki&s;&s;ing the &s;hepherde&s;s's hand, prote&s;ts again&s;t prejudiced fa|vour; and, to corroborate his argument, &s;ings an air pregnant with good &s;en&s;e as well as humour, which the magi&s;trate &s;eems nettled at, and the &s;hep|herde&s;s intimates, that Linco, being a friend to Syl|via, is her foe; this occa&s;ions the magi&s;trate to in|&s;i&s;t upon Sylvia's immediate appearance. The in|terruption given him by Linco, who at lea&s;t goes out for the &s;uppo&s;ed culprit, is whim&s;ical; here the &s;hepherde&s;s departs with full and warm a&s;&s;urances of protection.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething extremely well imagined in making Sylvia's charms in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;trike the the old &s;on of vice; for certain it is, that he who makes ju&s;tice give way to one &s;et of features, will al&s;o make her &s;ub&s;ervient to another that has more force, or novelty. He attempts que&s;tioning with authority, but is unable to ab&s;tract his ideas from her beauty; con&s;equently, utters him&s;elf in very incoherent &s;entences. This &s;cene is conducted with particular plea&s;antry. At length, Linco advi&s;es Sylvia, by way of making her cau&s;e more &s;ure, to &s;ing; this &s;he complies with, and &s;o powerful an effect is wrought upon the overwhelm|ed Dorus thereby, that he throws off all di&s;gui&s;e, and expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the tendere&s;t terms; at which critical point of time the &s;hepherde&s;s re-enters,
<PB N="429" REF="445">
to enquire if &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed; this nettles Dorus, who an&s;wers fretfully, but promi&s;ing to &s;peak with her in the ju&s;tice's chamber, &s;ends her off; then renews his profe&s;&s;ions of favour to Sylvia, with which, and a &s;pirited &s;ong by Linco, the third act concludes in a very plea&s;ing manner, as &s;u&s;pen&s;e is judiciou&s;ly &s;u&s;tained, and the humour well va|ried.</P>
<P>Urganda, hurricaned with violent perturbation of mind commences the fourth act; and, after a &s;oli|loquy, or rather incantation, rai&s;es a daemon of re|venge; who, like a very complai&s;ant fiend, ecchoes his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es purpo&s;e in a &s;ong, which calls up &s;ome of his infernal a&s;&s;ociates; after performing certain my&s;tical rites they follow the enchantre&s;s.</P>
<P>Linco draws in Damon and Dorilas by force, charges them with being jealous of Cymon and Syl|via, which makes them &s;o forward to carry that helple&s;s fair before Urganda; upon being rallied &s;e|verely by Linco, and pinched rather too clo&s;e, the &s;hepherd &s;eems to hint as if he could not excul|pate him&s;elf to the governor for &s;uch behaviour; however, the laughing blade &s;eems to treat &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion very lightly; and even when Dorus per&s;onally orders him to join in the &s;earch for Cy|mon and Sylvia, he makes &s;everal very ludicrous eva&s;ions, je&s;ting even in the face of authority; this irritates the magi&s;trate to di&s;mi&s;s him, and, in return, he gives Dorus a &s;evere rub, as never doing ju&s;tice, but in conformity to his inclinations, or pa&s;&s;ions; in obedience to which al&s;o he &s;ets her at defiance. The

lo&s;s of his place &s;its ea&s;y on this di&s;engaged hu|mouri&s;t, who &s;eems to think, as matters &s;tand, it is of little con&s;equence. We apprehend his &s;ong points at our political di&s;putes for &s;ome years pa&s;t, however, they are touched with a very gentle hand.</P>
<P>Fatima now appears upon the watch for Cymon, in obedience to her mi&s;tre&s;s's orders; Merlin comes upon her, and on account of her mi&s;chievous er|rand, determines to puni&s;h her. The conjurer be|ing invi&s;ible, he very conveniently hears what this female &s;py remarks concerning Cymon and Sylvia; his changing what &s;he has written to letters of blood, and quite a different purport from what &s;he intend|ed, gives a good opportunity for de&s;criptive action. On &s;eeing Merlin &s;he confe&s;&s;es &s;trong fear, and &s;ooths his compa&s;&s;ion in pitiful terms; this he will grant on one condition only, a po&s;itive injunction of &s;i|lence, which Fatima &s;eems to think, as nine tenths of the female world would do, a terrible tax upon loquacity; however, according to the trite pro|verb, that needs mu&s;t when &s;omebody drives, and upon Merlin's per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he con&s;ents, as a defeat to Urganda's curio&s;ity, to an&s;wer no otherwi&s;e than by the mono&s;yllables ay and no.</P>
<P>On the Magician's departure, in his dragon-drawn chariot, the terrified waiting woman de&s;cants on her deplorable &s;ituation in &s;oliloquy, and &s;eems to think his cruelty, in taxing the tongue &s;o unmercifully, is without precedent, A &s;ong upon the words &s;he is confined to, carries her off agreeably.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="447">Cymon and Sylvia now come forward, and renew their vows of con&s;tancy with much fervour. Upon her hinting apprehen&s;ion of Urganda, he fortifies her &s;pirits with Merlin's promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The air &s;ung by Sylvia, which we may call <HI>the &s;weet pa&s;&s;ion of love,</HI> is in the true pa&s;toral &s;train, and does not want poetical merit either in ver&s;ification or &s;entiment.</P>
<P>While Cymon and Sylvia are interchanging mu|tual endearments, they are be&s;et, on every &s;ide, by Dorus, Damon, Dorilas, and a parcel of their mirmidons, who fir&s;t taunt, and afterwards attempt to take them pri&s;oners; this enflames Cymon to re|&s;i&s;tance, he repels force by force; but while he is pur&s;uing a part of the runaways, others of them, with Dorus at their head, &s;urround Sylvia, who is hurried off by them to Urganda; Cymon return|ing, perceives the lo&s;s of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and utters his anxious feelings in an air bordering upon frenzy.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, we meet Ur|ganda and Fatima; the former glowing with curi|o&s;ity, the latter labouring under Merlin's limita|tion of &s;peech. The enchantre&s;s tries interrogation in every &s;hape without being able to obtain a &s;ati&s;|factory an&s;wer; from whence the &s;cene has &s;ome humour, but is indi&s;putably too long. Fatima is at length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by her enraged mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom Dorus enters, who meets but a rough recep|tion till he mentions Sylvia; the thoughts of having her in captivity &s;ooths Urganda, &s;he enquires after
<PB N="432" REF="448">
Cymon, and being informed that he could not be taken, &s;he determines to glut her re&s;entment on the unhappy object of his love; for which purpo&s;e, &s;he fir&s;t dooms Sylvia to death, but on &s;econd thoughts changes her &s;entence to confinement in the black tower, one of her enchanted ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>The innocent victim appears, is threatened and &s;hewn the gloomy &s;pot of her de&s;tin'd captivity, which &s;he looks on with becoming intrepidity, and &s;ings an air which turns on this pretty, in&s;tructive, though common thought, that innocence is an impregnable &s;hield again&s;t the mo&s;t gloomy terrors of fate; as they are forcing Sylvia to the tower, the dreary pro&s;pect, by means of Merlin's &s;uperior power, changes to one of comfort and magnificence; this &s;trikes the defeated enchantre&s;s with &s;hame and ter|ror, &s;he tries her wand, but finds its power bla&s;ted, and is ridiculed by her triumphant competitor. A flouri&s;h of martial mu&s;ic is heard, which cau&s;es her to enquire the meaning of it, to which Merlin re|plies that the hundred knights &s;ent by Cymon's fa|ther, in que&s;t of him, have been drawn together, and are preparing to grace the nuptials of Cymon and Sylvia; he reminds Urganda, that her ill treat|ment of him has counteracted all her &s;chemes; how|ever, he &s;hews &s;ome dawning of pity for her fallen &s;tate, which &s;he contritely thinks her&s;elf unworthy of, then breaking her wand retires with a ju&s;t re|mark, that power abu&s;ed de&s;erves to be &s;o annihi|lated.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="449">Here a grand proce&s;&s;ion of the knights is intro|duced, and indeed the execution of this pageantry on the &s;tage is equal to any idea we can form of &s;uch an affair; but from this, and many other pompous attractions thrown out to catch public curio&s;ity of late years, we are under a nece&s;&s;ity of remarking, that &s;uch luxury of &s;how, indicates a lamentable de|cay of ta&s;te: when the eyes u&s;urp the place of, or too much influence the ears in dramatic exhibitions, judgment is reduced to a deplorable &s;tate of &s;ervi|lity; however, this is critici&s;ing rather unfairly, while we review a piece founded upon magic; in that light the author of CYMON has been remarkably mode&s;t, and introduced as few mon&s;tro&s;ities as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>After the proce&s;&s;ion, Merlin gives a kind of nuptial benediction to the happy lovers; a chorus is &s;ung to Merlin's prai&s;e, after which, Linco recom|mends humourou&s;ly the old proverb, be merry and wi&s;e; this brings on alternate &s;inging, with inter|mingled chorus's by the &s;everal characters, and &s;o ends the romance.</P>
<P>We have already hinted that our bard, upon &s;o imaginary a plan, might, if he would, have overleap|ed the bounds of critici&s;m, nature and probability, much more than he has done, without any violent apprehen&s;ions of cen&s;ure; as to the &s;tile, all &s;uper|natural agents are in&s;ipid, except tho&s;e written by SHAKESPEARE, therefore, Merlin and Urganda cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to utter any thing much worth notice; indeed, they &s;ometimes entertain us with
<PB N="434" REF="450">
rhime, which we grant unnatural enough, but their pro&s;e would do as well for any other per&s;onages.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we cannot greatly applaud our author for purity, tho' we allow him &s;pirit of &s;tile, nor &s;ay much for novelty of &s;entiment, notwith&s;tanding, it mu&s;t be admitted, he has made good u&s;e of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims; his plot has not much intri|cacy, yet is plea&s;ing, the &s;cenes are placed in tolera|ble &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and if there are not the mo&s;t poignant &s;trokes of humour, there is little danger of atten|tion's drow&s;ing.</P>
<P>The &s;ongs might have been much better, or con|&s;iderably wor&s;e, mediocrity is the mo&s;t impartial character we can give; notwith&s;tanding a moral was very little to be expected from a piece of this kind, yet we find one both plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive, which is, that per&s;evering innocence need not de&s;pair under the mo&s;t apparent and terrifying difficulties, of finding effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that power, derived from evil principles, is of very fallible and peri&s;ha|ble nature, and that un&s;potted virtue is the mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect of the characters we find Cymon by enchantment a fool, and by the &s;ame means re&s;tored to a &s;tate of &s;en&s;ibility; Mr. VERNON, who has &s;ingular merit as an actor, &s;upports him in both &s;i|tuations with commendable ability.</P>
<P>Merlin is as good natured a conjuror as ever we have met, however, his interpo&s;ition on the &s;ide of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed innocence, does not proceed &s;o much from &s;ympathy, as from jealous re&s;entment conceived a|gain&s;t
<PB N="435" REF="451">
Urganda, for preferring Cymon to him in the ideas of love; hence &s;uch favourable events ari&s;e as render him an amiable agent; what he &s;ays or does, requires very little force of action, he depends upon plain, level, declamatory utterance, and &s;tood &s;o far re&s;pectable in the hands of Mr. BENSLEY, yet we think him con&s;iderably improved by Mr. BAN|NISTER.</P>
<P>Dorus is a good, becau&s;e too true picture of &s;uch magi&s;trates as hold ju&s;tice in the leading-&s;trings of their own pa&s;&s;ions, and wind her about as ca|price or intere&s;t directs; his amorous inclination throws him into laughable circum&s;tances, and Mr. PARSONS's performance of him &s;u&s;tains the author's intentions mo&s;t happily; it is con&s;iderable merit for action to keep equal pace with the writing; but to heighten it as the gentleman now before us does in this part, de&s;erves a greater &s;tretch of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Linco is a character of great vivacity, uniformly plea&s;ant from beginning to end, not only agreeable from the aptne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ions, but from their animating, benevolent tendency; upon this view it is not to be wondered that Mr. KING &s;hould dilate the brows of &s;evere&s;t critici&s;m, and obtain the plea|&s;ing tribute of general applau&s;e; we dont recollect a more di&s;engaged, cha&s;te piece of acting, and tho' we dont pretend to determine mu&s;ical merit, yet we are bold to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;ongs of Linco come with as much meaning and entertainment to the ear, as airs in their &s;tile po&s;&s;ibly can do.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="452">The Damon of Revenge has only a &s;ong, which we apprehend Mr. CHAMPNESS executes much to the &s;atisfaction of his hearers; the Shepherds are &s;o incon&s;iderable that to prai&s;e or cen&s;ure the per|formers of them would be a wa&s;te of critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Mrs. BADDELEY has merit in Urganda, but has too placid a &s;et of features, and too melodious a voice for the pa&s;&s;ions and gloomy &s;entiments of &s;uch a part. Mrs. SCOTT, though inferior, makes a tole|rable &s;hift in the enchantre&s;s.</P>
<P>Fatima is compo&s;ed of &s;pirited archne&s;s, and is &s;upported with a very capital degree of plea&s;antry by that excellent comic actre&s;s Mrs. ABINGTON; we apprehend, if the author, in&s;tead of the trifling upon yes and no, had thrown a kind of amorous in|tercour&s;e between this character and Linco, both parts would have received con&s;iderable addition, and two performers of general e&s;timation, would have been pre&s;ented to the audience in a more &s;triking light.</P>
<P>Sylvia, though &s;he did not ab&s;olutely die with Mrs. ARNE, has fallen into very evident con&s;ump|tive &s;ymptoms; not but we allow Mi&s;s RADLEY merit, both as an actre&s;s and a &s;inger,</P>
<P>The Shepherde&s;&s;es cannot be in better hands than tho&s;e of Mi&s;s REYNOLDS and Mi&s;s PLYM, nor is Mi&s;s BURTON unworthy favourable notice in one of them at pre&s;ent. Mrs. BRADSHAW, in Dorcas, fills up the author's idea, and gratifies any expecta|tion &s;pectators may form.</P>
<P>This romance was certainly intended as a mere theatrical repre&s;entation, and as &s;uch it affords very

<P><PB N="439" REF="455">Cato commences with Portius and Marcus, the former cooly and the latter impetuou&s;ly lamenting the perilous &s;tate of their father and their country, they are both furni&s;hed with ob&s;ervations worthy of great and patriotic minds, but Marcus dimini&s;hes much by introducing his amorous pa&s;&s;ion when matters of &s;o much deeper concern claim attention, and Por|tius di&s;graces his dignity by mean di&s;&s;imulation; the advice he gives Marcus is worthy a philo&s;opher, but when we con&s;ider it &s;prings from a de&s;ire of weaning him from the object of his own affection, it &s;inks under the denomination of plau&s;ible artifice; thus the elder brother becomes le&s;s an object of e&s;tima|tion in this &s;cene than the younger: on the appear|ance of Sempronius, Marcus retires to prevent his mental agitation from being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Sempronius not immediately &s;eeing Portius, hints at a con&s;piracy, but goes to no point of explanation, as the youth catches his eye; under a previous pro|fe&s;&s;ion of di&s;&s;imulation, he &s;peaks as a &s;on of Liber|ty, mourning her approaching fate: a fine compli|ment to Cato occurs, that of his virtues rendering the penurious and &s;hattered remains of Rome's &s;e|nate awful; it is a&s;toni&s;hing why our author &s;hould have blended &s;o much love with a &s;ubject &s;o foreign to it, yet Sempronius mentions his pa&s;&s;ion for Mar|cia, as does Juba &s;ometime after, &s;o that there are four &s;wains employed in &s;ighing even while Cae&s;ar is at, and ready to &s;torm their gates. Portius indeed ju&s;tly mentions, that it is a mo&s;t unfavourable &s;ea|&s;on to court his &s;i&s;ter, and goes off with a &s;pirited
<PB N="440" REF="456">
re&s;olution of encouraging the &s;oldiers to fulfil their duty as Romans.</P>
<P>On his departure Sempronius, in &s;oliloquy, gives us to under&s;tand, that he expects Syphax, a Numi|dian chief, to grant him a&s;&s;i&s;tance in matters of mi&s;|chief; then informs us, that Cato's refu&s;al of Marcia to his wi&s;hes rou&s;es re&s;entment, and thence intimates a de&s;ign of giving up Cato to Cae&s;ar; Syphax's ap|pearance brings this point to further explanation, the Numidian general declares his troops ready for a re|volt, but at the &s;ame time acknowledges and laments Juba's firm attachment to the virtuous Roman; Sempronius, however, urges a fre&s;h trial to bring over that young prince. We admire Mr. ADDI|SON's idea of hypocritical patrioti&s;m, where on the principles of deception he makes Sempronius &s;peak thus:
<Q><L>I'll conceal</L>
<L>My thoughts in pa&s;&s;ion ('tis the &s;ure&s;t way)</L>
<L>I'll bellow out for Rome and for my country,</L>
<L>And mouth at Cae&s;ar till I &s;hake the &s;enate;</L>
<L>Your cold hypocri&s;y's a &s;tale device;</L>
<L>A worn-out trick&mdash;Would&s;t thou be thought in earne&s;t</L>
<L>Cloath thy feign'd zeal in rage, in fire, in fury.</L></Q></P>
<P>He goes off to cultivate a &s;pirit of mutiny a|mong&s;t the Roman &s;oldiers, and leaves his friend to work, if po&s;&s;ible, upon Juba; the young prince immediately appears, and taxes Syphax with looks of gloomy coldne&s;s, de&s;iring an explanation; the old man, in a &s;hort, blunt reply, throws a &s;arca&s;ti|cal charge on, and di&s;claims Roman di&s;&s;imulation; this draws from Juba a liberal compliment in favour
<PB N="441" REF="457">
of his allies; in return, Syphax enters into a &s;pirited compari&s;on of Numidian worth, but confines him|&s;elf to martial excellence, while Juba very &s;en&s;ibly contra&s;ts the moral and &s;ocial virtues; this warms the rough impatience of the old general, who gives his expre&s;&s;ion &s;uch &s;cope, that the prince is under a nece&s;&s;ity of giving a check, which &s;tomachs the ve|teran, and cau&s;es him to try the pathetic, by mak|ing mention of Juba's dying father; afterwards he touches upon Juba's love as the foundation of his other attachments, and paints the &s;uperior charms of tho&s;e beauties who may be met with in his own court of Zama, but the royal youth mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly returns, that his regard is fixed upon internal not ex|ternal merit; here Marcia and Lucia appear, which cau&s;es Syphax to retire, execrating the former, as being con&s;cious that a &s;mile from her can overturn all the power of his per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>The intercour&s;e between Juba and his mi&s;tre&s;s we deem extremely in&s;ipid, the lady indeed judiciou&s;ly reproves her lover's whining at &s;uch an intere&s;ting point of time, and &s;ends him off to more material concerns with becoming re&s;olution; Lucia, who &s;eems to have &s;ofter and le&s;s noble ideas than Mar|cia, upbraids her with giving the <HI>good-natured</HI> prince, as &s;he oddly &s;tiles him, &s;uch treatment: Cato's daughter, however, manife&s;ts great good &s;en&s;e in proceeding upon the principles of &s;elf-denial, rather than effeminate the public cau&s;e; Lucia confe&s;&s;es her&s;elf unequal to &s;uch fortitude, hence ari&s;es a di&s;|covery of her attachment to one of Marcia's bro|thers,
<PB N="442" REF="458">
which, on enquiry, proves to be Portius; this makes Marcia commi&s;erate and plead the cau&s;e of Marcus, Lucia confe&s;&s;es great perplexity between the two lovers, which Marcia &s;trives to &s;often by a friendly and pious ob&s;ervation, that pre&s;ent &s;orrow under cele&s;tial influence, may lead to future happi|ne&s;s. She concludes the act with a very beautiful &s;imile, harmoniou&s;ly, but unnaturally expre&s;&s;ed in rhime.</P>
<P>Act the &s;econd introduces the Roman &s;enate in expectation of Cato, who, after a few prefatory lines appears. In his addre&s;s to the &s;enate, he informs them with ju&s;t dignity of &s;entiment, how affairs &s;tand, and ob&s;erves the nece&s;&s;ity, from Cae&s;ar's near approach, of determining upon defen&s;ive or &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures: Sempronius, according to what he mentions in the fir&s;t act, delivers him&s;elf with all the impetuo&s;ity of a zealot for liberty, he draws an irritative picture of pa&s;t tran&s;actions, and con|cludes with a bold figure of being called to vin|dictive mea&s;ures by the mourning &s;hades of de|parted citizens.</P>
<P>Cato, in return, with political, as well as philo|&s;ophical moderation ob&s;erves, that impa&s;&s;ioned ar|guments and re&s;olutions are &s;eldom founded in rea|&s;on, and that tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with the lives of fellow &s;ubjects, &s;hould avoid wa&s;te of blood, up|on principles of fal&s;e fame; the opinion of Lucius runs in a mild and pacific turn, which occa&s;ions Sem|pronius to drop a malevolent in&s;inuation again&s;t him; however, Cato maintaining a ju&s;t equilibrium
<PB N="443" REF="459">
of deliberation, draws a ju&s;t and in&s;tructive line of di&s;|tinction, between an overheated rapidity of opinion, and a frigid coldne&s;s; wi&s;ely ob&s;erving, that though it is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid romantic ra&s;hne&s;s, it is in|cumbent on brave men and free &s;pirits to u&s;e with becoming intrepidity, all tho&s;e means which provi|dence has put into their hands; from what he &s;ays, re&s;i&s;tance upon prudential and virtuous principles, &s;eems to be his re&s;olution, which he clo&s;es with a glorious ob&s;ervation upon the intrin&s;ic value of un|corrupt liberty.</P>
<P>Being acquainted by Marcus that an amba&s;&s;ador from Cae&s;ar demands admittance, with the &s;enate's concurrence, he orders the admi&s;&s;ion of Decius, who greets him in friendly terms, and is an&s;wered with a mo&s;t elevated re&s;erve, where they only appertain to him&s;elf; but with much forceable and expletive dignity where public concerns are touched upon.</P>
<P>Through the whole of this admirable interview, our hero throws a&s;ide the paltry con&s;ideration of &s;elf with princely contempt, and his &s;pirited terms for the good of his country, out&s;tretch all prai&s;e; the author has al&s;o contrived to &s;u&s;tain Decius in &s;o agreeable a light, that it requires almo&s;t &s;toical firm|ne&s;s not to think with him, that Cato's un&s;hakeable per&s;everance is rather too rigid, and that he &s;peaks more in the &s;tile of conque&s;t than unequal compe|tition.</P>
<P>Upon the departure of Cae&s;ar's repre&s;entative, Sempronius is forward to thank Cato for his re&s;o|lute conduct; and takes an opportunity of being
<PB N="444" REF="460">
rough with Lucius; for which he receives an ele|gant reproof from Cato; &s;eeing Juba approach the &s;enators retire, when a &s;hort interview &s;ucceeds be|tween that prince and Cato, who tells the Numidian what re&s;olution the &s;enate have taken; after approv|ing what he hears, Juba, by a diffident round about method, makes ab&s;urd mention of Marcia; to which her father replies with keen and &s;uitable bre|vity, leaving the lover in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;hed per|plexity.</P>
<P>In this condition of mind Syphax finds his royal ma&s;ter, and artfully tries therefrom to work up the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, for which deep purpo&s;e he &s;ooths his vanity with prai&s;e, and again recalls the idea of his father, then comes plump on the object of his affection, pointing out a way to make her his in &s;pite of Cato, which expedient we find to be car|rying her off by force; this Juba rejects with laud|able and con&s;ummate di&s;dain, giving Syphax &s;ome very &s;evere and ju&s;t reproofs for &s;o unworthy a pro|po&s;ition; the&s;e warm the old man into expre&s;&s;ions improper for a &s;ubject, and Juba is in con&s;equence irritated &s;o far as to give him the &s;tinging appella|tion of traitor, a term which awakens his caution, and warns him of having over&s;tepped the bounds of prudence; this indi&s;cretion he endeavours to re|pair by humble conce&s;&s;ion, which not taking im|mediate effect, he mo&s;t artfully di&s;claims all appro|bation of the &s;cheme he propo&s;ed, and &s;ays the de|&s;ign of carrying off Marcia by force, was only &s;ug|ge&s;ted to palliate the pains of his prince's love; this
<PB N="445" REF="461">
works happily on Juba's tender, un&s;u&s;pecting nature, and the practi&s;ed politician worms him&s;elf into an additional degree of confidence, by &s;peaking in high terms of Cato's precepts and example; falling into this trap of deception, the prince offers kind recon|ciliation, and withdraws; however, Syphax, in a &s;hort &s;oliloquy, points out the difference of age and youth with re&s;pect to affronts, and re&s;olves upon an entire attachment to Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Sempronius's entrance brings on further expla|nation, and upon Syphax's enquiry how Cato de|ports him&s;elf amid&s;t &s;urrounding perils, he receives the following an&s;wer, replete with poetical beauty.</P>
<Q><L>Thou ha&s;t &s;een mount Atlas</L>
<L>When &s;torms and tempe&s;ts thunder on its brows,</L>
<L>And oceans break their billows at its feet;</L>
<L>It &s;tands unmov'd and glories in its height.</L></Q>
<P>There never was a finer idea &s;truck out of a great man remaining un&s;haken, amid&s;t many violent a&s;|&s;aults of frowning fortune. Syphax mentions the impo&s;&s;ibility of gaining Juba to their &s;ide, to which Sempronius makes a kind of ludicrous reply, and the de&s;ign of gaining Marcia for him occurs; upon comparing notes they &s;eem to think every point of the pro&s;pect favours their de&s;ign; as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Roman mutineers, Syphax promi&s;es that the Numidians under his command &s;hall be ready at the moment, and he draws a mo&s;t fanciful &s;imili|tude between the &s;torm of &s;edition, and tho&s;e over|whelming whirlwinds which often ri&s;e in the African de&s;arts; nothing can be more elegantly expre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="446" REF="462">
but the jingle is very offen&s;ive to critici&s;m founded on nature.</P>
<P>The third act opens with Marcus and Portius conver&s;ing upon the love affair, which we have al|ready condemned as a very cen&s;urable intru&s;ion up|on the dignity of this piece.</P>
<P>We find Marcus, as at the beginning, overheated with pa&s;&s;ion, and Portius endeavouring to mitigate him; the former deputes the latter to be his advo|cate, to &s;ollicit Lucia's favour for him; this the latter attempts to decline, and &s;eems to feel &s;ome touches for playing a double dealing part, howe|ver, he dare not &s;peak openly, therefore, upon Lu|cia's appearance, is left by his brother to plead the cau&s;e of his love; and how does he do it? by ad|vi&s;ing the lady to act as hypocritically as him&s;elf. This, however, &s;he generou&s;ly declines, and vows not to enter the nuptial tie with Portius, however warmly inclined thereto, while &s;uch family affliction is likely to flow from their union. This re&s;olution alarms the impatient feelings of Portius, who charges the fair one with coldne&s;s, and exclaims in terms frantically incon&s;i&s;tent with the idea we have hi|therto formed of his character. The lady's faint|ing is a mo&s;t laughable circum&s;tance, and the whole &s;cene, which ends as it began, is &s;uch a laboured, unfini&s;hed aim at une&s;&s;ential pa&s;&s;ion, that we hear|tily wi&s;h it annihilated.</P>
<P>When Lucia retires, Marcus comes forward to enquire his fate, and forms an explanation of it from the confu&s;ed countenance of his brother. This in|terview
<PB N="447" REF="463">
is made up of as &s;trange and unintere&s;ting materials as the former, nor can we think how the author could have carried them off with any grace, had not a martial &s;ymphony rou&s;ed their attention; it is &s;ome plea in favour of the young heroes, that love has not totally enervated patrioti&s;m, but that, as Portius ob&s;erves, they are warmed to action by the trumpet's voice.</P>
<P>Sempronius having ripened his mutineers to ac|tion, now appears at their head, encouraging them to per&s;evere, this is promi&s;ed; when Cato enters, with philo&s;ophic fortitude he que&s;tions the muti|neers concerning the motives of their ba&s;e conduct, and rates them with irre&s;i&s;table proofs of their in|gratitude; Sempronius, who perceives their &s;pirits &s;inking, cur&s;es their timidity, and when Lucius recommends their contrition to Cato's mercy, urges &s;evere&s;t execution, evidently to &s;creen him&s;elf; however, Cato declining every trace of cruelty, dooms them to death in the milde&s;t manner, ob&s;erv|ing, with great propriety,
<Q><L>When by ju&s;t vengeance guilty mortals peri&s;h,</L>
<L>The gods behold their puni&s;hment with plea&s;ure,</L>
<L>And lay th' uplifted thunderbolt a&s;ide.</L></Q></P>
<P>When this matter is &s;ettled, and Cato goes off, we perceive the mutineers have con&s;idered Sempro|nius's behaviour as calculated to deceive Cato in their favour; however, they find, too late, that their imperfect, da&s;tardly behaviour, as well it might, has &s;ired him to the mo&s;t eager re&s;entment, and are carried off to meet an ignominious fate. Indeed,
<PB N="448" REF="464">
they are the &s;trange&s;t in&s;truments of &s;edition we have ever met, and &s;eem to be introduced for no other rea&s;on than to give Cato two or three good &s;peeches, and to in&s;inuate, that his awful pre&s;ence was &s;ufficient to look men out of their lives.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme being rendered abortive, Syphax enters, tells Sempronius that his Numidian troops are all mounted, and advi&s;es an attack upon the gate where Marcus holds watch, by &s;eizing of which, they may gain Cae&s;ar's camp; here Cupid interferes again, and reminds Sempronius, that Marcia is left behind; this difficulty &s;tarted, Syphax, like an adept in the arts of intrigue, as well as tho&s;e of po|litical treachery, propo&s;es carrying her off, and for pro&s;ecuting this matter with more certainty, pro|mi&s;es to furni&s;h Sempronius, not only with the ha|bit of Juba, but his guards al&s;o, by means of which he may gain ea&s;y acce&s;s to Marcia's chamber; this delightful ma&s;querade &s;cheme, &s;o con&s;i&s;tent with tragedy, and this in particular, is highly reli&s;hed by Sempronius, who draws from it the mo&s;t favourable omens of &s;ucce&s;s, and concludes the third act with a pompous, high-flown a&s;&s;imilation of his projected adventure to the Rape of Pro&s;erpine.</P>
<P>The two ladies favour us with their appearance at the beginning of the fourth act; Lucia &s;till com|plaining of her wonderful perplexity, reminds Mar|cia of her &s;imilar &s;ituation, between Juba and Sem|pronius, but places tho&s;e lovers in a faint point of view when compared with her inimitable Portius: it is true, love will be partial, but need not be made
<PB N="449" REF="465">
unpolite. Marcia declares di&s;like of Sempronius, and approbation of Juba, but dutifully &s;uppo&s;es &s;he has no will of her own during Cato's life. At the &s;ound of approaching feet the&s;e female friends re|tire, and make way for Sempronius, as Juba, to appear; during his exultation at the near com|pletion of his bold wi&s;hes, Juba, to his utter a&s;to|ni&s;hment enters, thus confronted, nothing but the death of one or both can decide their contention; this lot falls upon Sempronius, who dies with a vindictive execration in his mouth, while Juba goes to acquaint Cato with &s;o &s;trange and intere&s;ting an event.</P>
<P>Lucia and Marcia, alarmed with the cla&s;h of &s;words, again come forward, when the royal habit of Numidia being perceived on a dead body, Mar|cia, with the precipitate fears of love, immediately concludes it to be Juba, and throwing off all re&s;erve proclaims her pa&s;&s;ion in the warme&s;t, mo&s;t undi&s;|gui&s;ed terms; at which critical juncture, her living lover comes within hearing, and becomes a tran|&s;ported witne&s;s of her amorous explanation; till unable longer to contain, he pre&s;ents him&s;elf to her a&s;toni&s;hed view, and heals her poignant woe; &s;he &s;eems to regret that her heart has been &s;o fully &s;et to view, but generou&s;ly confirms the prince's hap|pine&s;s, by repeating her declarations of regard; thus they are &s;ent off the &s;tage tolerably happy, after the mo&s;t ridiculous, bo-peep tran&s;actions, that ever di&s;graced any piece of &s;erious compo&s;ition; the
<PB N="450" REF="466">
whole love epi&s;ode is indi&s;putably pitiful, but this la&s;t mentioned &s;cene de&s;erves &s;overeign contempt.</P>
<P>Cato and Lucius next come forward, the latter expre&s;&s;ing &s;urprize at Sempronius's conduct, the for|mer, like an able practical judge of life, declaring, that general depravity takes away all &s;ubjects of &s;ur|prize.</P>
<P>Portius, with looks indicating deep concern, ap|proaches, and is que&s;tioned by his father if Cae&s;ar has &s;hed more Roman blood, an interrogation ani|mated with the true &s;pirit of greatne&s;s, &s;ignifying, that no other cau&s;e &s;hould move &s;uch apparent anxie|ty. On being told of Syphax's perfidious retreat, and that an attack is made upon Marcus's po&s;t, he|roically forgetting the apprehen&s;ions of a tender pa|rent, he is only concerned for his &s;on's behaviour, and &s;ends off Portius expre&s;s to &s;ee that his brother's duty is fulfilled. On the appearance of Juba, covered with &s;hame for his general's treacherous be|haviour, Cato manife&s;ts great liberality of mind, in &s;oftening a charge of guilt the young prince levels again&s;t him&s;elf, as being a Numidian, of which cha|racter Syphax has ju&s;t given &s;o abominable a &s;pe|cimen.</P>
<P>Portius's return and abrupt mention of Marcus alarms our hero's fears, lea&s;t his &s;on has been any way deficient, but, upon hearing the manner of his fall, after a very gallant defence, the illu&s;trious Roman utters a mo&s;t noble and comprehen&s;ive ex|clamation in two words&mdash;<HI>I'm &s;atisfied</HI>&mdash;Never did any author &s;uit expre&s;&s;ion to character and circum|&s;tance
<PB N="451" REF="467">
better than Mr. ADDISON has done in this well-adapted &s;troke of &s;ignificant brevity: Syphax's fate is a plea&s;ing &s;acrifice to ju&s;tice, and draws from Cato a line of real dignity, mixed with paternal ten|derne&s;s.</P>
<P>On meeting the corp&s;e of his &s;on in &s;uch a mang|led condition, any father, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mere natural feelings, would manife&s;t a weakne&s;s, though an a|miable one; but Cato, buoyed up by uncommon re&s;olution, and the love of his country, &s;upports the &s;hock of &s;o affecting an object with admirable firm|ne&s;s; nay, draws a plea&s;ing picture of death obtain|ed upon &s;o glorious an occa&s;ion, and &s;peaks of it in &s;uch in&s;pirative terms, that the frowns of the king of terrors melt into &s;miles.</P>
<P>Pointing out the example of the dead to the liv|ing &s;on is judicious and affecting, and we are of opi|nion, that an almo&s;t unparalleled magnimity of mind is manife&s;ted in letting &s;orrow's melting tribute fall for the mi&s;eries of his country, though he refu&s;ed it to the decea&s;e of a beloved &s;on.</P>
<P>His de&s;cription of Rome's decay ri&s;es in a beau|tiful climax, and concludes with a &s;evere &s;troke upon Cae&s;ar, as a political parricide; the di&s;dain he &s;hews at any idea of &s;olliciting or receiving Cae&s;ar's mercy is noble, his advice to Portius worthy of a philo&s;o|pher, the attention paid to the &s;afety of his friends generous, and the leave he takes of them pathetic: if he had not been carried off by the monotonous jingle of metre, we do not perceive one idea or ex|pre&s;&s;ion, throughout this &s;cene, which we could wi&s;h
<PB N="452" REF="468">
altered in any &s;hape; nor do we know where ratio|nal &s;en&s;ations can be more profitably gratified than by an adequate repre&s;entation of it.</P>
<P>Though we cannot admit of an equality with Hamlet's celebrated &s;oliloquy, yet we readily place that of Cato, at the beginning of the fifth act, before any other we have met; the chain of rea&s;oning is well compacted, the &s;entiments reach a very uncom|mon degree of elevation, and in&s;truction pours forth from every line; the intru&s;ion of Portius, through filial anxiety for his father's &s;afety, is re|proved rather &s;ternly by Cato, however, he &s;oon calms, and collects him&s;elf again&s;t the wor&s;t events that fortune may have in &s;tore, gives his mourning &s;on hopes, and retires to take the refre&s;hment of &s;ome &s;leep to recruit his exhau&s;ted &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Marcia joins her brother Portius, who comforts her with the idea that Cato is more compo&s;ed, and has determined to live for the &s;ervice of Rome. When Lucia comes on, we find her &s;till harping on the love affair, amazingly out of &s;ea&s;on, as we think, e&s;pecially as &s;he &s;eems to draw an uncouth inference in her own favour, from the melancholy circum|&s;tance of Marcus's death, a circum&s;tance not very fit for an affectionate &s;i&s;ter's ear. Lucius coming on, gives an account of Cato's plea&s;ant &s;ituation in his &s;leep, which we think rather too clo&s;e upon Cato's exit, for him to fall a&s;leep, and Lucius to watch him &s;o minutely as he has done; be&s;ides, orders were given that no per&s;on &s;hould approach him, but this even in the view we place it is a very venial
<PB N="453" REF="469">
&s;lip; by intelligence Portius brings, there are hopes of &s;uccours to relieve Utica, and to place Cato in a probability of redeeming the glory, or &s;taying the fate of Rome; but this tran&s;ient dawn of comfort &s;oon pa&s;&s;es off on the wings of an alarm rai&s;ed by hearing a groan from Cato's chamber.</P>
<P>By the &s;uddenne&s;s of this, after Lucius's account, one would be almo&s;t led to think Cato had &s;tabbed him&s;elf in his &s;leep; that he has given the fatal wound is confirmed by his appearance in an expir|ing condition; the addre&s;s he makes to his afflicted children and mourning friends, is very con&s;onant to his character: Benevolence, paternal tenderne&s;s and invincible re&s;olution, attend his la&s;t moments, and he falls into eternity an object of admiration, though a very dangerous and cen&s;urable &s;ubject of imitation for any man, in any &s;tation.</P>
<P>Lucius concludes the piece with deducing a diffu&s;e general moral from Cato's fall, which ob&s;erved in a national &s;en&s;e, as the author undoubtedly meant it, furni&s;hes very u&s;eful, political in&s;truction, and warns us again&s;t the perilous con&s;equences of civil commotions which with undi&s;tingui&s;hing rage &s;weep away the mo&s;t virtuous, as well as the mo&s;t vicious characters, nay indeed, oftner fall heavy on the former as foes to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, than the latter who thrive in and con&s;equently are mo&s;t active to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through a piece which at its fir&s;t repre&s;entation, from &s;everal cau&s;es made a great noi&s;e, and met uncommon approbation, even from
<PB N="454" REF="470">
contending parties, we cannot help ob&s;erving after due acknowledgment of its u&s;eful political, and in many places moral tendency, that the author has in &s;everal &s;cenes trifled with his &s;ubject &s;trangely and we confe&s;s much &s;urprized, that a per&s;on of Mr. ADDISON's judgement, &s;hould have enervated his genius, which had much more dignity than &s;oftne&s;s, with &s;uch in&s;ipid love &s;cenes, &s;o incongruous to the re&s;t of his piece, e&s;pecially when a more uniform plan could have been pur&s;ued, by introducing Cae&s;ar in his camp di&s;patching Decius on his emba&s;&s;y, mak|ing him treat the proffered treacherous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sempronius with contempt, and bringing him after Cato's death upon the &s;tage to offer &s;ome ju&s;t &s;tric|tures on the impropriety of his killing him&s;elf, which even as a Roman Cae&s;ar might have done, &s;ince it is very certain that a life of &s;o much public con&s;equence &s;hould not be &s;acrificed to &s;elfi&s;h pride, admitting that &s;uicide in other ca&s;es might be ju&s;ti|fied.&mdash;</P>
<P>We are &s;orry that &s;elf-de&s;truction is placed in &s;o fair a point of view, and therefore think the cata&s;|trophe of this tragedy highly cen&s;urable becau&s;e evi|dently pernicious.</P>
<P>In point of character, as a man, Cato &s;trikes us with awful, yet agreeable &s;en&s;ations; he is a cool philo&s;oper, a warm patriot, a re&s;olute chief, an eloquent &s;enator, a tender parent, and an affectio|nate friend; but as the brighte&s;t compo&s;ition mani|fe&s;ts &s;pecks, &s;o we find this great man tainted with &s;uch a degree of inflexible pride, that when he
<PB N="455" REF="471">
&s;hould &s;tand mo&s;t collected, he gives way to that powerful principle, and ra&s;hly flies from his coun|try, children and faithful a&s;&s;ociates, into the arms of death.</P>
<P>To per&s;onate this character happily, requires con&s;equence both of per&s;on and countenance; a me|lifluous exten&s;ive fullne&s;s of voice and depth of judgment; theatrical chicane cannot be of any &s;ervice; we doubt not, but it will &s;eem trea&s;on again&s;t the maje&s;ty of e&s;tabli&s;hed critici&s;m, to doubt Mr. QUIN's &s;uperiority within the la&s;t thirty years; yet we mu&s;t venture the bold a&s;&s;ertion, that deduct|ing his figure, a&s;pect and &s;uitable voice, he was as erroneous as &s;uch attributes would admit; his acti|on had a laboured &s;amene&s;s in it; his utterance ap|peared more &s;ub&s;ervient to the cadences of mea&s;ure than the periods of &s;en&s;e, and his tones frequently &s;welled into offen&s;ive pompo&s;ity; in &s;ome of the lines to Decius, he &s;truck out beauties; in receiving the news of Marcus's fall, he was fine, and wept for his country in the following &s;cene like a great man; but his &s;oliloquy and mo&s;t other parts of the character, were chaunted in a very culpable manner; &s;o far that we will be hardy enough to a&s;&s;ert, to a nice ear he proved him&s;elf more of the methodical &s;pouter, than the affluent orator.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN wants face and figure much, but &s;peaks the author unexceptionably; and by keeping his voice more within its compa&s;s than in parts of greater force and variety, mu&s;t render impartial critici&s;m great plea&s;ure; for a dumb Cato we &s;hould
<PB N="456" REF="472">
have given Mr. QUIN great pre-eminence, but for a &s;peaking one prefer Mr. SHERIDAN, with all his imperfections, as coming nearer the author and na|ture.</P>
<P>Mr. MOSSOP, from what we have ob&s;erved, can never be admired as a declaimer; &s;uch empha&s;is hunting as he is guilty of, &s;hames oratory; and &s;tiff|ened awkwardne&s;s of deportment ill &s;upplies the place of ea&s;e and dignity: Mr. ROSS was too much of the gentleman, too little of the hero in externals; and, as to &s;peaking the part, his utmo&s;t merit only reaches the prai&s;e of delivering his part in the manner of a well-tutored &s;chool-boy at Mr. RULE's, or any other academy. Mr. WALKER di&s;|covered, four or five years &s;ince, at Covent Garden, a very con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit, but not enough to &s;erve as a &s;tanding di&s;h for public entertainment.</P>
<P>As we cannot remember all the per&s;ons we have &s;een in the &s;everal parts of this play, it is hoped that mention of tho&s;e who &s;trike our recollection will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>Portius appears to be &s;en&s;ible, and virtuou&s;ly in|clined, but di&s;&s;embles &s;hamefully with his brother, and is in action very in&s;ipid: Mr. BENSLEY's re|pre&s;entation of him gives us tolerable &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Marcus is of an undi&s;gui&s;ed, generous, warm tem|per, and, if tolerably &s;upported, always claim re|&s;pect on the &s;tage: Mr. RYAN did him originally, and we doubt not with great merit, but was too much in the vale of years when we &s;aw him to look
<PB N="457" REF="473">
any thing like the character; however, we &s;uppo&s;e he did it for the &s;ame rea&s;on a &s;trolling player of &s;ixty, once gave for retaining the part of the School Boy, I have done it, &s;ays he, forty years ago, and therefore think I have a right to do it now. Mr. DYER has afforded us &s;atisfaction in this character, and Mr. WROUGHTON, tho' la, la, was more &s;ufferable than in any other part we have &s;een him play.</P>
<P>Juba is a well-di&s;po&s;ed young prince, and &s;eems to have ideas of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ame on worthy prin|ciples; his attachment to Cato would, however, re|dound much more to his honour, if there was not rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e his love for Marcia the foundation of it. In point of action, he cannot be rendered very &s;triking, being too much in the &s;tile of medio|crity; the be&s;t we remember to have &s;een was Mr. DIGGES, who gave him much more force and va|riety than Mr. SMITH, though we think the latter a tolerable Numidian prince.</P>
<P>Sempronius is a rogue of very black dye, who does not &s;cruple to attempt giving the la&s;t &s;tab to expiring liberty, and who wants to betray the mo&s;t virtuous citizen, merely on account of being re|fu&s;ed the object of his amorous pa&s;&s;ion. He is a fair-faced villain, and couches dark de&s;igns under the veil of patriotic profe&s;&s;ions; extent and weight of expre&s;&s;ion are e&s;&s;ential to this part, wherefore, we are induced to pronounce Mr. MOSSOP the be&s;t with|in our knowledge; Mr. SPARKS was extremely re|&s;pectable,
<PB N="458" REF="474">
and we have received &s;ome plea&s;ure from Mr. CLARKE, in this treacherous &s;enator.</P>
<P>Syphax is a rogue al&s;o, and di&s;loyal to his prince, but he is &s;o upon rather a &s;tronger principle than Sem|pronius, for having conceived a fixed antipathy a|gain&s;t the Romans, who&s;e poli&s;hed manners he in|terprets effeminacy, and being enraged at Juba's attachments to Cato, he endeavours to per&s;uade him therefrom, which being declined with har&s;h terms, the te&s;ty old Numidian takes the per&s;onal affront clo&s;e to heart, and thoroughly connects him&s;elf with Sempronius's views. This character we deem bet|ter drawn than any other in the piece, and &s;upport|ed with great uniformity of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Mr. THE. CIBBER, in our judgment, formed a more adequate idea of Syphax than any other per|former; his di&s;&s;imulation and te&s;tine&s;s was de&s;crib|ed excellently by that judicious comedian; but he retained &s;o much of the cant, which is now happily exploded, that we could only applaud him for what he meant, not what he did. Mr. GIBSON is a mighty lukewarm repre&s;entative of the old Numi|dian, but unle&s;s Mr. HULL &s;hould venture on him, is as well as any other per&s;on at pre&s;ent in Covent Garden. Indeed, to &s;ay truth, take it for all in all, there never was &s;uch a mangled &s;pectacle &s;een at a Theatre Royal, as this tragedy was in April, 1770, at that hou&s;e; and however &s;trange the a&s;&s;er|tion may &s;eem, it is &s;trictly true, that Mr. GARD|NER manife&s;ted more characteri&s;tic merit in Lucius, than any other per&s;on in the whole drama. Of all
<PB N="459" REF="475">
the Decius's we have &s;een, we don't recollect one &s;ufficiently to authorize particular mention.</P>
<P>Marcia is a lady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ju&s;t and elegant &s;en|timents, a worthy offspring of the great Cato, except where &s;he is rendered rather ridiculous by the meta|morpho&s;e and fall of Sempronius: Mrs. WOF|FINGTON gave that importance to the character by her figure and action, which Mr. ADDISON left for the actre&s;s to &s;upply; Mrs. BELLAMY &s;u&s;tained the part very well, &s;o did Mrs. HAMILTON; as to Mi&s;s MILLER, lately, &s;he was inoffen&s;ive, and that's as high as mo&s;t of the young performers can reach.</P>
<P>Lucia is a very tender-hearted fair one, violently enamoured, yet &s;ays or does very little worthy the the lea&s;t notice; a good tragic actre&s;s might be ren|dered in&s;ipid by &s;uch a part, no wonder then that Mrs. MATTOCKS &s;hould move through it without any degree of prai&s;e; Mrs. STEPHENS's manner and expre&s;&s;ion is better calculated to make things of this &s;ort agreeable, than any other theatrical lady we know.</P>
<P>Party is of a very dangerous nature to dramatic repre&s;entations, but both <HI>whigs</HI> and <HI>tories</HI> taking this piece as a compliment to them&s;elves, &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported it, and gave a &s;anction it never de&s;erved, for we mu&s;t ab&s;olutely deny its theatrical excellence; it is certainly a moral, colloquial poem of great me|rit, but a tragedy full of defects; it &s;hould be im|mortal in the clo&s;et, but cannot ju&s;tly claim po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the &s;tage.</P>

<HEAD>AS You LIKE It. A COMEDY by SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS pa&s;toral comedy, for &s;uch it may proper|ly be &s;tiled, opens with Orlando and Adam, the for|mer a young gentleman, recounting to the latter, &s;teward of the family, the &s;canty provi&s;ion made for him by the will of his father, and the cruelty of his elder brother, who treats him with much contempt, not only neglecting his education, but putting him under the &s;evere nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;ociating with menial &s;ervants; this, he confe&s;&s;es, rankles in his mind, and he expre&s;&s;es a commendable determination to bear it no longer. Here his elder brother, Oliver, ap|pears, and acco&s;ts him in a churli&s;h manner, to which he replies at fir&s;t with complacence, but, upon irri|tation, makes &s;pirited retorts, and their conference ri&s;es to a quarrel, which the old man endeavours to &s;often; Orlando claims his &s;mall patrimony, or more re&s;pectful u&s;age; the former &s;eems mo&s;t a|greeable to Oliver, who partly promi&s;es it, and then not only di&s;mi&s;&s;es his brother with much malevo|lence, but forbids Adam his hou&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>From an interview between Oliver and Charles, the wre&s;tler, we find that Duke Senior is bani&s;hed by his brother, but that Ro&s;alind, on account of the affection Celia, Duke Frederic's daughter, bears her, does not go into exile with him; upon Charles's
<PB N="461" REF="477">
mention that he hears Orlando has a private inten|tion of wre&s;tling with him, &s;ugge&s;ts to Oliver a mo&s;t brutal idea, no le&s;s than the de&s;truction of his inno|cent brother, and this he cultivates by bribing the wre&s;tler to exert all his &s;uperior &s;trength again&s;t him, with the utmo&s;t malevolence; and after this ready agent of his malice di&s;appears, gives a mo&s;t ex|traordinary rea&s;on for his hatred of Orlando, no o|ther than the many amiable qualities of that youth, which he is either unable or unwilling to imitate.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alind and Celia &s;ucceed this worthy blade, the former expre&s;&s;ing a dejection of &s;pirits, on ac|count of her father's exile, the latter offering cor|dial con&s;olation, which prevails, and produces &s;port|ive mention of love, which Celia rather &s;eems to think dangerous to play with; &s;ome &s;peeches, when fortune is propo&s;ed as a &s;ubject of their mockery, we cannot help tran&s;cribing, on account of the truth and plea&s;antry of tho&s;e ideas they create. "Bene|fits, &s;ays Ro&s;alind, are mightily mi&s;placed, and the bountiful, blind lady doth mo&s;t mi&s;take in her gifts to women:" to which Celia prettily replies, "'Tis true, for tho&s;e that &s;he makes fair, &s;he &s;carce makes hone&s;t, and tho&s;e that &s;he makes hone&s;t &s;he makes very ill-favoured:" however, we think, ac|cording to a cu&s;tom of SHAKESPEARE's, they play too long upon words, and wear imagination thread|bare; the clown appears as a me&s;&s;enger, and de&s;ires Celia to go to her father, in that familiar &s;tile adopt|ed by &s;uch gentry; his a&s;&s;uring the truth of what he
<PB N="462" REF="478">
has &s;aid upon his honour, occa&s;ions an egregious but laughable quibble of terms.</P>
<P>When Le Beu enters, he acquaints the ladies that they have lo&s;t much &s;port; upon enquiry into the nature of the amu&s;ement they have mi&s;&s;ed, it appears to be a wre&s;tling match, wherein three young fellows have had many bones broke, are in danger of their lives, while their aged father is di|&s;tracted with grief at their misfortune, which, as the clown &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erves, mu&s;t be notable &s;port for ladies.</P>
<P>Duke Frederic, with Orlando, Charles, &amp;c. enter, the duke humanely pitying Orlando's inequality of per&s;on for an athletic contention, has endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from the trial, but in vain; where|fore Frederic de&s;ires the young ladies to try their per&s;ua&s;ion; this kind ta&s;k they readily undertake, and delicately enter upon the &s;ubject; however, the young man appears to be under a gloomine&s;s of mind, which makes life or death a matter of indif|ference to him; the ladies &s;eeing him &s;o hazardou&s;ly bent afford him all they can, good wi&s;hes for &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>The wre&s;tler vaunts his &s;uperiority with great ap|parent confidence, while Orlando &s;hews engaging contra&s;t mode&s;ty; this contention, though an odd incident for the &s;tage, occa&s;ions an agreeable anxiety, and the effect of it, Orlando's victory, very plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations; making Ro&s;alind and her cou&s;in extend favour to the weaker party, is a ju&s;t, and genteel compliment to female genero&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="463" REF="479">Upon enquiry who Orlando is, and finding him the &s;on of Sir Rowland de Boys, Duke Frederic &s;eems to entertain &s;trong prejudice again&s;t his father, and goes off abruptly. Ro&s;alind here mentions the affectionate regard <HI>her</HI> father had for Sir Rowland, which prejudices her in favour of Orlando, to whom &s;he and her cou&s;in offer congratulation for his e&s;cape and unexpected &s;ucce&s;s; upon their going off he drops a hint in two lines of a particular effect Ro&s;alind has had on him. Here Le Beu enters, and acquaints Orlando, that whatever fair appearance Duke Fre|deric might wear, his temper is of a dangerous, un|certain nature, and cannot &s;afely be tru&s;ted, therefore advices his departure.</P>
<P>Orlando's enquiry which was the duke's daugh|ter, is an&s;wered by information, that Ro&s;alind, the taller, is daughter of the bani&s;hed, and Celia of the reigning duke; who, by Le Beu's intimation, en|tertains a di&s;like of his niece, which is &s;oon likely to appear; Orlando thanks his friendly advi&s;er, and they go off &s;everally.</P>
<P>Celia and Ro&s;alind re-enter, from what occurs be|tween them we perceive, that Ro&s;alind has &s;uddenly conceived more than a friendly regard for Orlando. The duke now makes his appearance in great wrath, though from what immediate provocation we know not, and dooms his niece to &s;udden bani&s;hment; Ro&s;alind mode&s;tly pleads her innocence, and Celia urges her friend&s;hip as motives for remi&s;&s;ion of &s;o har&s;h a &s;entence, but the duke &s;eems immoveable in his whim&s;ical &s;everity, and even limits the extent of

Ro&s;alind's &s;tay. Celia's determination to &s;hare the exile of her cou&s;in and friend, manife&s;ts mo&s;t amiable and tender genero&s;ity of mind; they determine to &s;eek Duke Senior in the fore&s;t of Arden, agree to di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, Ro&s;alind as a man, Celia as a &s;hepherde&s;s, and go off with a compo&s;ure of mind truly philo&s;ophical.</P>
<P>The &s;econd act commences with the old duke and his faithful followers, as forre&s;ters; we have more than once objected to frequency and length of quo|tation, notwith&s;tanding con&s;iderable pains might have been &s;aved thereby; however, we are now come to a &s;peech &s;o replete with moral meaning and poetical beauty, that we cannot avoid pre&s;enting it as a treat to the reader.</P>

<P>When the&s;e rural philo&s;ophers, as we may call them, retire, Duke Frederic, and &s;ome attendant lords appear; the duke intent upon finding out his eloped daughter; as we remember, this &s;hort &s;cene is omitted in repre&s;entation, and in peru&s;al &s;eems of very little importance, unle&s;s we receive it in the light of mere connection, nor can it be then very material; however, &s;earch is ordered for the runa|ways, and as Orlando is &s;uppo&s;ed of the party, his el|der brother is called upon.</P>
<P>The &s;cene changing to Oliver's hou&s;e, Orlando appears knocking at the door, and is an&s;wered by Adam; a mo&s;t feeling conver&s;ation en&s;ues, wherein Adam &s;peaks powerfully to every generous &s;en&s;ati|on; his offering the &s;mall &s;um his oeconomy has &s;aved, to Orlando's u&s;e, is truly affecting; his reli|ance on that general providence which caters for bea&s;ts of the field, and birds of the air, is worthy a pious, &s;en&s;ible heart; and the di&s;tinction he makes between temperate and licentious youth admirably in&s;tructive. Orlando's grateful &s;en&s;e of this good and affectionate old &s;teward's behaviour, is by no

means inadequate, and their going off &s;tamps a re|gard which mu&s;t render them both acceptable to the audience whenever they appear.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alind, in her ma&s;culine habit, with Celia and the Clown now pre&s;ent them&s;elves, much wearied with their journey; however, the Clown indulges his quaint wittici&s;ms. Corin, an old &s;hepherd, and Sylvius, a young one, come forward, the latter men|tioning his love for Phoebe, the former advi&s;ing him to a moderation of his pa&s;&s;ion; Ro&s;alind &s;ympa|thizes with Sylvius; they a&s;k Corin for his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in re&s;pect of &s;ome refre&s;hment, and receive an ho&s;pitable an&s;wer; upon his telling them that the farm and flocks he belongs to are to be &s;old, Ro&s;a|lind and Celia expre&s;s a de&s;ire of becoming pur|cha&s;ers, and con&s;titute the old &s;hepherd their agent for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A very in&s;ignificant &s;cene between Jacques, Ami|ens, &amp;c. en&s;ues, indeed, there is a &s;ong which, by the help of Dr. ARNE's very agreeable mu&s;ic, ren|ders it tolerable.</P>

<PB N="468" REF="484">
&s;econd objection to the manner of placing the words lo&s;e and neglect, they &s;hould certainly be tran|&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>The duke's replying to Orlando upon tho&s;e ideas he has &s;ugge&s;ted, is prettily imagined, and the young man's attention to his old friend extremely amiable. This unexpected gue&s;t, and the account he has given, draws from the duke a mo&s;t u&s;eful, con&s;olatory and philo&s;ophical remark: That however unhappy we may be, there are others as much or more &s;o. Jaques here delivers that ma&s;terly picture of human life, commonly called the Seven Ages, which we &s;hould think it our duty to tran&s;cribe, but that it has been &s;o often quoted and parodied, that &s;carce any per&s;on can be unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>Orlando entering with Adam, they receive a kind welcome, and partake of the entertainment, while Amiens &s;ings that agreeable and &s;en&s;ible &s;ong, "Blow, blow, thou winter's wind." The duke learns who Orlando is, and mentions in the conclu|&s;ive &s;peech of this act, the regard he had for that young man's father.</P>
<P>Duke Frederic appears at the beginning of the third act, demanding Orlando of his brother Oliver in angry terms, and upon not receiving a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he orders a &s;eque&s;tration of Oliver's effects, with bani&s;hment of his per&s;on; this &s;hort &s;cene is often omitted in repre&s;entation, but we think it &s;hould always be retained.</P>
<P>Orlando now con&s;tituted one of Duke Senior's followers, as a tribute to his love, hangs up a copy
<PB N="469" REF="485">
of ver&s;es, addre&s;&s;ed to Ro&s;alind, in a tree, expre&s;|&s;ing his pa&s;&s;ion in an agreeable &s;oliloquy.</P>
<P>Corin and Touch&s;tone entertain us with a conver|&s;ation which exhibits &s;everal &s;trokes of &s;en&s;ible, tho' whim&s;ical &s;atire, but delicacy is much offended by &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages; however, the following &s;peech of Corin makes amends for many &s;lips: "Sir, I am a true labourer, I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's happine&s;s, glad of other men's good, content with my harm, and the greate&s;t of my pride is to &s;ee my ewes graze and my lambs &s;uck."</P>
<P>Ro&s;alind comes in reading Orlando's ver&s;es on her&s;elf, which the Clown very humorou&s;ly burle&s;ques. Celia enters reading another poem of amorous ten|dency; after &s;ending off the Clown and Corin, &s;he enters into a conference with her cou&s;in Ro&s;alind, upon the ver&s;es and the writer of them, and after teizing her with &s;u&s;pen&s;e, informs her that Orlando is the man, which throws Ro&s;alind into a pretty, natural palpitation of heart. Seeing Orlando and Jaques approach, they draw back, while a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e pa&s;&s;es between tho&s;e gentlemen, the latter of whom cynically rails at the former's &s;oft amorous tendency, which brings on retorts from each &s;ide not of the civile&s;t nature; when Jaques goes off, Ro&s;a|lind approaches with confidence, under favour of her di&s;gui&s;e, and rallies Orlando with very plea&s;ing vivacity; her di&s;tinctions re&s;pecting the paces of time are peculiarly plea&s;ant.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="486">The picture drawn of a lover, and the method of cure for amorous feelings, &s;hew a ju&s;t idea of na|ture. Ro&s;alind's mode of drawing in Orlando to woo her, as his mi&s;tre&s;s, is an agreeable device, for this purpo&s;e &s;he takes him off to &s;hew him her cot, that he may call every day.</P>
<P>A &s;cene of &s;ome little laugh &s;ucceeds between the Clown and Audry, which is generally concluded in repre&s;entation by a mo&s;t pitiful and ful&s;ome rhime to the woman's name. Ro&s;alind and Celia &s;ucceed, expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome doubts concerning Orlando's con|&s;tancy; the old &s;hepherd comes on, and acquaints them, that the love-&s;ick &s;wain, Silvius, whom they have often enquired after, is at hand, with his hard-hearted mi&s;tre&s;s; when the Sylvan pair enter, they li&s;ten; on finding Phoebe ob&s;tinately bent again&s;t Silvius's &s;olicitation, Ro&s;alind &s;teps in to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and catechi&s;es the &s;cornful &s;hepherde&s;s with great humour; checking him al&s;o for pro&s;tituting his prai&s;e to encrea&s;e that vanity which damps his &s;uit. Phoebe throws out a few hints of tender re|gard for Ro&s;alind, which are treated with di&s;dain, and Silvius is ordered to pur&s;ue her. After Ro&s;a|lind and Celia go off, we find Phoebe lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of the former, as a captivating youth; how|ever, &s;he &s;oftens &s;o far in favour of Silvius, that &s;he admits of his wooing; then expre&s;&s;es &s;ome re&s;ent|ment at the freedom with which Ro&s;alind treated her, determines on writing a &s;harp letter in return, which Silvius promi&s;es to deliver, and thus the act concludes.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="487">In the fir&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act, we are enter|tained with a good deal of &s;pirited quibble and word-catching, between Ro&s;alind and Orlando; one pa&s;|&s;age is &s;o peculiarly beautiful, that its merit will &s;uffi|ciently apologize for its appearing here. When Or|lando &s;ays he will love for ever and a day, &s;he replies, "Say a day without the ever: no, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed; maids are May when they are maids, but the &s;ky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock pidgeon over his hen; more clamorous than a parrot again&s;t rain; more new fangled than an ape; more giddy in my de&s;ires than a monkey; I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain; and I will do that when you are di&s;po&s;ed to be merry. I will laugh like a hyen, and that when you are a&s;leep."</P>
<P>When Orlando goes off to attend the duke at din|ner, Ro&s;alind profe&s;&s;es regard for him even to a ro|mantic degree of warmth, and &s;he gives a whim&s;ical account of Cupid. Here a &s;hort &s;cene between Jaques and &s;ome other forre&s;ters intervene, but is o|mitted in repre&s;entation, &s;o that Silvius comes on directly to Ro&s;alind with Phoebe's letter, which is no &s;ooner peru&s;ed but Ro&s;alind &s;tiles it rank abu&s;e; however, on communicating the contents, it appears, the enamoured &s;hepherde&s;s has &s;trung together &s;eve|ral jingling couplets of compliment; Silvius is con|founded by his me&s;&s;age and the &s;trange interpretation of it, which cau&s;es Ro&s;alind to &s;end him with a charge to Phoebe, that &s;he mu&s;t love him.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="488">Here Oliver approaches the ladies, enquiring for their cottage, Celia points out its &s;ituation; howe|ver, from appearance, he judges them to be the per&s;ons he &s;eeks for; upon being confirmed in this opinion, he pre&s;ents a bloody napkin to Ro&s;a|lind, and Orlando's excu&s;e for not coming accord|ing to appointment. The de&s;cription of his own perilous &s;ituation, and the generous interpo&s;ition of Orlando to &s;ave his life, are &s;et forth with much poetical beauty; but ab&s;urdity, in point of circum|&s;tances, &s;trikes our perception plainly; for how could all he mentions have happened during the &s;hort interval of Orlando's ab&s;ence; particularly, how has he had time to change from the wretched &s;tate of being ragged and overgrown with hair, in which be lay under the oak, to his pre&s;ent appearance; in|deed, he talks of being led to the duke, who or|dered him array and entertainment: but, upon the whole, we think matters are oddly hudled together, merely to favour a flight of fancy.</P>
<P>The hurt Orlando has received in his &s;kirmi&s;h with the lione&s;s, overpowers the &s;pirit of Ro&s;alind, that &s;he faints under the depre&s;&s;ion, and is led home by Celia and Oliver.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, Touch&s;tone and Audry offer them&s;elves to view, and are joined by William, a &s;impleton, upon who&s;e weakne&s;s, Touch&s;tone indulges his own &s;uppo&s;ed wit very liberally; an account of Audry, at la&s;t he breaths out mo&s;t terrible threats if William &s;hould entertain any thoughts of that amiable creature; this is a
<PB N="473" REF="489">
&s;cene which makes us laugh without our knowing why, and con&s;i&s;ts more of mere whim than good &s;en&s;e or u&s;eful &s;atire; upon a &s;ummons by the old &s;hepherd they go off.</P>
<P>Orlando and Oliver next appear, the former, as well he may, expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urprize that Celia, as Aliena &s;hould have &s;o &s;udden and forceable an effect upon the latter; it is indeed an affair of much ha&s;te, however Oliver not only acquaints us with his own pa&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o informs us, that Aliena has ex|changed love with him; when Duke Frederic ba|ni&s;hed Oliver, order was given to &s;eque&s;ter all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and from the condition in which Orlando found him, it is rea&s;onable to think tho&s;e orders had been amply fulfilled; yet here he propo&s;es giv|ing his e&s;tate to Orlando, and turning &s;hepherd him|&s;elf for the &s;ake of Aliena.</P>
<P>When Ro&s;alind comes on, after expre&s;&s;ing con|cern for Orlando's accident, &s;he confirms Oliver's account of the love affair between him and Celia; we wi&s;h a hint, with which her ob&s;ervation upon the propo&s;ed marriage concludes, was made deli|cate. On Orlando's expre&s;&s;ing concern that his happine&s;s is not &s;o near as his brother's &s;he comes to the point, and promi&s;es, if he is &s;o inclined, that when his brother is married, he &s;hall marry Ro|&s;alind; Silvius and Phoebe joining company, the &s;everal parties expre&s;s them&s;elves prettily as their di&s;|po&s;itions lead; their conver&s;ation is a &s;ort of cro&s;s purpo&s;es, which Ro&s;alind ends by &s;atisfying all parties with a &s;tring of oenigmatical promi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="490">In repre&s;entation Duke Senior with his followers come next; to them enter Ro&s;alind, Silvius and Phoebe; the heroine under favour of di&s;gui&s;e urges a previous compact on all &s;ides; from her father &s;he extracts a promi&s;e, that upon re&s;toring his daughter he will give her to Orlando, from Orlando that he will receive her, from Phoebe that &s;he will marry her, or declining that, Silvius; then goes off as &s;he &s;ays to make all doubts even.</P>
<P>Touch&s;tone and Audry coming forward, the company are entertained with &s;ome free, &s;ignifi|cant remarks, by the former: his proofs of being a courtier, and his di&s;&s;ertation upon quarreling, are admirable; we have not met a &s;everer reproof of the fal&s;e fire and romantic honour of formal duelli&s;ts, than this affair of Touch&s;tone's, upon a cau&s;e &s;even times removed.</P>
<P>Ro&s;alind, re&s;tored to the cu&s;tomary appearance of her &s;ex, enters, is recognized by her father and lover, rejected as a woman by Phoebe, and thus her compact with all parties becomes fulfilled. Matters being brought to this agreeable conclu&s;ion, Jaques de Boys comes on, and acquaints the duke of his re&s;toration; Duke Frederic having been checked in the career of his wickedne&s;s, and per&s;uaded to re&s;ign the dukedom by a religious hermit, with this fa|vourable account, and a pro&s;e epilogue, which never fails of working a very plea&s;ing effect, the comedy of AS YOU LIKE IT concludes.</P>
<P>This piece con&s;idered at large has a very roman|tic air, the unities &s;uffer &s;evere inva&s;ion, &s;everal
<PB N="475" REF="491">
&s;cenes are very trifling, and the plot is hurried on to an imperfect cata&s;trophe: we hear &s;omething of Oliver's being puni&s;hed as an unnatural, abomina|ble brother, but have a &s;trong objection to crown|ing &s;uch a mon&s;ter with fortune and love. An in|terview between the dukes would have afforded an opportunity for genius and judgment to exert them|&s;elves commendably; however, with all its faults, there is not a more agreeable piece on the &s;tage; the characters are various, and all well &s;upported; the incidents, if not &s;triking, are certainly plea&s;ing; the &s;entiments, with very few exceptions, are pregnant with u&s;eful meaning; and the language, though quaint in &s;ome places, &s;hews in general &s;trength and &s;pirit worthy of SHAKESPEARE's pen.</P>
<P>Duke Senior is an amiable character, &s;u&s;tained with philo&s;ophical dignity, turning the frowns of fortune, as every man &s;hould do, into the means and motives of in&s;truction: what he &s;ays is not of &s;uffi|cient length to con&s;titute a very con&s;picuous part in action, but if a performer has any declamatory me|rit, he may &s;hew it to advantage here. We have no objection to Mr. BURTON in this noble exile, but wi&s;h Mr. ACKMAN may never think of him, except as a fea&s;t upon his own benefit night, that happy &s;ea|&s;on when annuals vegetate into characters of con&s;e|quence in the drama, and large capital letters in the bills.</P>
<P>Duke Frederic is a notorious villain, of whom no performer can po&s;&s;ibly make any thing, wherefore we &s;hall not mention any body. Jaques, a cynical
<PB N="476" REF="492">
&s;peculati&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much good &s;en&s;e with great oddity: Mr. QUIN was an object of much admi|ration in this part, but from the opinion we have al|ready delivered of that gentleman's declamatory abi|lities, it is impo&s;&s;ible to admit that prai&s;e the par|tial, mi&s;led public allowed him, Mr SHERIDAN wants nothing critici&s;m can demand, he looks the part well enough, and &s;peaks it with the &s;ame degree of emphatic, de&s;criptive feeling with which the au|thor wrote. Mr. DIGGES did it con&s;iderable ju&s;tice; Mr. SPARKS and Mr. BERRY both had merit, but were too laborious and heavy; Mr. LOVE's utterance of Jaques's fine, flowing periods, puts us in mind of liquor gurgling through the di&s;|&s;onant pa&s;&s;age of a narrow-necked bottle.</P>
<P>Orlando, without any &s;triking qualifications, is an agreeable per&s;onage, and never can appear to more advantage than through the late Mr. PAL|MER's repre&s;entation of him; there was a degree of &s;pirited ea&s;e manife&s;ted by him not ea&s;ily met with, and his per&s;onal appearance was mo&s;t hap|pily adapted: Mr DEXTER, a performer of me|rit, in &s;everal parts, rendered this young man very plea&s;ing; and Mr. ROSS, gave as much &s;atisfaction upon the whole as any audience could rea&s;onably expect; as to Mr. REDDISH, he does not look at all like the character, and &s;peaks it too &s;ententiou&s;ly, wherefore we cannot allow him that approbation he mo&s;tly de&s;erves, and we are glad to give him.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="493">Adam is a mo&s;t intere&s;ting old man, and though little &s;een, mu&s;t always remain in the recollection of a di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;pectator; we dont recollect to have received greater plea&s;ure from any body than Mr. MOODY, in this faithful &s;teward: who&s;e tender &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t &s;it well al&s;o upon the feelings and expre&s;&s;ion of Mr. HULL.</P>
<P>Touch&s;tone, in &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion, is made up of whim, a character quite outr&eacute;; therefore in action cannot be tied down to any exact line of na|ture. Mr. MACKLIN marked the meaning of this character very &s;trongly, but wanted volubility; Mr. WOODWARD is extremely plea&s;ant, and indulges an extravagance not cen&s;urable; however, in re&s;pect of pointedne&s;s and &s;pirit properly mixed, a forceable yet free articulation, Mr. KING &s;tands foremo&s;t in our e&s;timation.</P>
<P>We remember to have had the &s;ingular plea&s;ure of &s;eeing no le&s;s than five ladies perform Ro&s;alind with great merit, who&s;e names we &s;hall &s;et down in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion allotted them by our judgment; Mrs. BARRY, Mrs. PRITCHARD, Mrs. WOFFINGTON, Mi&s;s MACKLIN, and Mrs. HAMILTON; the three former had a very evident &s;uperiority over the two latter, and the two fir&s;t we deem &s;o equal in merit, that we only prefer Mrs. BARRY as having a more agreeable, characteri&s;tic appearance; Mrs. WOF|FINGTON's figure was unexceptionable, but her ut|terance and deportment were too &s;trongly tinctured with affectation, e&s;pecially for the rural &s;wain; there is a peculiarity and embarra&s;&s;ment of expre&s;&s;ion in
<PB N="478" REF="494">
this part which requires good natural parts or able in&s;truction, to hit it off happily.</P>
<P>Celia has a good deal of pretty, unimpa&s;&s;ioned &s;peaking, as well calculated for Mrs. BADDELY and Mrs. W. BARRY as po&s;&s;ible, nothing is wanted in the part which tho&s;e ladies cannot agreeably furni&s;h; and Audry in Mrs. BRADSHAW's hands, de&s;erves the tribute of laughter, for being well figured, and as well &s;poke.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to remark, that as not one of SHAKESPEARE's pieces is without abundant beau|ties, &s;o not one can claim the prai&s;e of being free from egregious faults; however, in AS YOU LIKE IT, the latter fall very &s;hort of the former; and we make no &s;cruple to affirm, that this piece will afford con&s;iderable in&s;truction from attentive peru&s;al, with great addition of plea&s;ure from adequate repre&s;enta|tion.</P>
<P>We are now come to the end of our fir&s;t volume, with the very &s;ingular &s;atisfaction of not having one material objection, either public or private, offered again&s;t our humble endeavours, notwith&s;tanding that living authors and performers have been treated with undi&s;gui&s;ed, and we hope liberal freedom; if any per&s;on mentioned in the foregoing &s;heets can prove a trace of partial, intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, un|becoming timidity, or determined malevolence; if the prai&s;e and cen&s;ure alternately be&s;towed on the &s;ame per&s;ons do not appear founded upon rea&s;on and nature, or at lea&s;t the offspring of involuntary error, the authors of this work will then give up all claim
<PB N="479" REF="495">
to the unbia&s;&s;ed veracity they originally profe&s;&s;ed; and they once again declare, that no connection or view whatever, &s;hall, in the continuation of this work, warp opinion: &s;everal attempts have been made for that purpo&s;e, but without effect; which they hope will prevent any future ones; critics, like the Roman, &s;hould exerci&s;e ju&s;tice, even upon a &s;on.</P>
<P>It was intended to add an inve&s;tigation of each performer's particular requi&s;ites and defects, but by re&s;pectable advice, which we &s;hall always follow, that part of our de&s;ign is deferred to the la&s;t number of the &s;econd volume; to which al&s;o we &s;hall add a di&s;&s;ertation upon public elocution in general, and lay down rules by which mo&s;t of our critici&s;ms on per|formance may be tried.</P>
<P>We have nothing further to add at pre&s;ent, but cordial gratitude for the very candid reception we have met; and hope that our &s;lips, as &s;everal there mu&s;t be in &s;uch a variety of con&s;iderations, may be pointed out with the &s;ame &s;pirit of kind cen&s;ure, we have u&s;ed to others; in the fulne&s;s of heart we de|clare that prai&s;e in every in&s;tance has given us con|&s;iderable plea&s;ure, and the irk&s;ome nece&s;&s;ity of find|ing fault, has furni&s;hed an equal degree of pain.</P>
<P>The li&s;t of theatrical mu&s;hrooms is al&s;o by de&s;ire po&s;tponed to the end of the next volume, when it will no doubt be con&s;iderably enriched.</P>
