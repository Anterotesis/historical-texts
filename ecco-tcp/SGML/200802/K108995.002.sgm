<HEAD>BOOK III. THE FRENCH THEATRE UP TO THE DEATH OF VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. THE ORIGIN OF OPERA, AND ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>WE &s;hall now find the affairs of the French theatre &s;o blended with the &s;erious and comic opera, and a variety of &s;pectacles branching from tho&s;e exhibi|tions, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give an account of their e&s;tabli&s;hment in FRANCE to make this de&s;crip|tion of the drama in that country complete; and as it cannot be denied that mu&s;ic, taken as an em|belli&s;hment, excites and &s;atisfies curio&s;ity in a more gratifying and delightful manner than any other dramatic amu&s;ement, I &s;hall beg the reader's pa|tience for a few pages while I &s;peak of that be|witching art, in order to &s;hew how opera originated,
<PB N="6" REF="4">
and in what manner it e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf in FRANCE and other countries.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to trace the origin of mu&s;ic con|&s;idered as a &s;cience. In its literal and extended idea, which the ancients di&s;tingui&s;hed by the term Har|monica, it was born with the world. The more we &s;earch, either into holy writ, or into mythology, the more we &s;hall be convinced that mu&s;ic made up the delight of all countries at all times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So early as the fourth chapter of Gene&s;is, we find JUBAL, who we are told was the father of all &s;uch as handle the harp and organ; and if we go into mythology, have we not APOLLO the mu&s;es and the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres?</NOTE>; nay, that it was the &s;ort of order that lent perfection to the chaos in which other &s;ciences were involved; and that was the rea&s;on, perhaps, the ancients gave to every art the appellation mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The Egyptians inform us that mu&s;ic was in|vented immediately after the flood, and the idea of in&s;truments, which naturally implies harmony, are by inumerable authors &s;aid to have been of very early invention. MERCURY we are told found a tortoi&s;e &s;hell and &s;tretching cords acro&s;s it formed the lyre. LUCRETIUS &s;ays that wind in&s;truments had their origin from the whi&s;tling of the wind among the ru&s;hes. AMPHION, CHIRON, DEMO|DOCUS,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
HERMES TRISMEGISTUS, OLYMPUS, and ORPHEUS, are all reported to have been celebrated mu&s;icians, and performers on mu&s;ical in&s;truments; nay, to what perfection mu&s;t this art have been brought at the time of the Grecian republic, if it be true that TERPANDER &s;et the laws of LYCUR|GUS to mu&s;ic, that he was well acquainted with the modes, and that THALES, and THAMYRUS knew the nature of in&s;trumental mu&s;ic without &s;inging.</P>
<P>But the more we &s;earch into this exqui&s;ite and endle&s;s theme, the more we &s;hall be bewildered with conjecture, though facts &s;tare us in the face. A ho&s;t of writers on one &s;ide contend that the ancients alone knew how to render mu&s;ic facinating, and that the degree of perfection from which it derived that power to which ORPHEUS and others had brought it is lo&s;t to the moderns; others contend that the an|cients knew nothing of harmony, and one of them in&s;i&s;ts that what is called harmony, or the doctrine of combined &s;ounds, was invented by GUIDO ARETINE, a benedictine friar.</P>
<P>Let us examine this. The ancients had in&s;tru|ments, and to talk of in&s;truments without the idea of combined &s;ounds, is ridiculous and contemptible. It would be pedantry, and perhaps impertinence here, to &s;peak particularly of twelve or fourteen
<PB N="8" REF="6">
&s;tringed in&s;truments among the ancients which were &s;truck either with the hand or a plectrum; of &s;ix or &s;even wind in&s;truments, particularly the hydraulic or|gan, the very title of which explains the ingenuity of its con&s;truction; and as many pul&s;atile in&s;tru|ments; it is enough to &s;ay that we know the&s;e in|&s;truments were at that time in u&s;e, and, therefore, that harmony, to its fulle&s;t extent, mu&s;t have been known, for no one will be &s;o ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e that this great variety of in&s;truments were played on one at a time; but, if it had been &s;o, does not every &s;tringed in&s;trument an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of harmony?</P>
<P>Every adventitious accident, from whence pro|ceeds &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ounds, even the creaking of a door, produces the effect of a chord, and therefore leads to combined &s;ounds. Two uncon&s;cious watchmen &s;hall cry the &s;ame hour in thirds, but this is obvious in a thou&s;and in&s;tances; and as to mea&s;ure, the marching of &s;oldiers, the ringing of bells, the forging an anchor, and the galloping of an hor&s;e, will give you all the varieties of common and tripple time. The words
<Q><L>" From harmony, from heavenly harmony,</L>
<L>" The univer&s;al frame began,"</L></Q>
came from the truly lyric &s;oul of DRYDEN; and a lovely and a delicious truth it is. The divine and
<PB N="9" REF="7">
exqui&s;ite beauty of order is mu&s;ic, of which me|lody is like the &s;un that cheers the univer&s;e, and harmony like creation it&s;elf that exults and rejoices under its cele&s;tial influence.</P>
<P>If it be meant, as &s;ome warmly contend, that the ancients in their choru&s;es had but one &s;ong, and though there were a variety of voices each di&s;tinct voice &s;ung the &s;ame individual melody, it does not alter the ca&s;e. Did the lyre, the p&s;alterium, the tibia, the cornuus, the tympanum, the tintinnabulum, did the&s;e join the voices in playing the &s;ame &s;ong, the &s;ame individual melody? 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible. Some of the&s;e in&s;truments, out of many others then in u&s;e, were incapable of it; their contracted &s;cale would not admit of it. No; it was an accompanyment, a dre&s;s to adorn the melody; which, like the deco|ration of beauty, by di&s;gui&s;ing &s;ome parts, gave to tho&s;e that were di&s;cerned a &s;uperior degree of loveline&s;s.</P>
<P>I'll put this fact in an incontrovertible light. A large congregation &s;hall &s;ing the hundreth P&s;alm; and though there is the difference of an octave in the voices of men from the voices of women and children, yet they will &s;ing the &s;ame di&s;tinct indi|vidual melody; and a mo&s;t delightful melody it is. What follows? They are accompanied by an organ
<PB N="10" REF="8">
which combines all tho&s;e harmonious principles we have been &s;peaking of, the full organ even to ab|&s;tru&s;ene&s;s. What does it &s;ignify then whether the voices &s;ing the &s;ame melody, or &s;ing in parts? By the introduction of this accompanyment is not the concert full and complete? And, this admitted, who &s;hall &s;ay that the ancients were &s;trangers to harmony in mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I &s;hould think it very probable that their mu&s;ic was like their writings, grand, natural, and im|pre&s;&s;ive; and, if &s;o, by u&s;ing le&s;s complication, they delighted not &s;urprized the mind, and therefore the &s;implicity of their harmony, by an&s;wering all the be&s;t purpo&s;es of mu&s;ic, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the inexplicable and di&s;tracting &s;y&s;tem of modern harmoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>The&s;e and a thou&s;and other rea&s;ons incline us to believe that dramatic entertainments were invented through the medium of mu&s;ic. Dithyrambics were, as we have &s;een, actually &s;ung by one per&s;on, and we may go further and &s;ay that HOMER, HESIOD, and all the ancient poets &s;ung their &s;ongs of what nature &s;oever for the amu&s;ement of the public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HESIOD by way of an in&s;trument u&s;ed to accompany his voice with a &s;witch, or bundle of rods, which by being &s;martly twitched with the hand produced a &s;ort of whi&s;tling &s;ound. I think this in|&s;trument might be applied to &s;ome of our modern &s;ingers with very good effect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9">This admitted, &s;omething as much in the nature of opera as other dramatic entertainments were in the nature of plays, certainly made at all times a part of the amu&s;ements of the theatre; and that &s;o&s;tenuto for which LULLY has been &s;o greatly admired, and which, I dare &s;ay, was dull enough, was clearly that &s;u&s;tained &s;leepy declamatory effect &s;o often com|plained of in the choru&s;es of the ancients.</P>
<P>Opera, however, being in its capability more ex|traneous and le&s;s natural as a vehicle to convey re|gular and probable action, was longer than any other &s;pecies of dramatic production before it took a tone and a form &s;o as to be cla&s;&s;ed &s;eparately and di&s;tinct from other &s;tage repre&s;entations; and it is very pro|bable, though the regular opera had often been at|tempted, it never would have become any thing more than a vehicle for the introduction of dances and decorations, had it not found a &s;ort of AESCHY|LUS in METATASIO.</P>
<P>JOHANNES SULPITIUS, a native of VEROLI, is &s;aid to have exhibited operas in the fifteenth cen|tury; and we are told that EMILIO CAVALIERE, in 1590, exhibited two dramas, &s;et to mu&s;ic, in the Palace of the Grand Duke of FLORENCE. We hear al&s;o of OCTAVIO RINUCCINI who brought an opera on the theatre at FLORENCE, in 1633, in
<PB N="12" REF="10">
honour of the marriage of MARY de MEDICIS with HENRY the fourth of FRANCE.</P>
<P>We have &s;een by VOLTAIRE's account how opera came to be introduced into FRANCE. I &s;hall, therefore, now proceed to relate &s;ome par|ticulars of LULLY who pre&s;ided &s;o long at the head of that entertainment. LULLY was born at FLORENCE in 1633, and died in PARIS in 1687. Being an excellent performer on the violin, he was invited to FRANCE, where he became &s;uperintendant of the king's band, and by addre&s;s and cunning &s;oon introduced him&s;elf into all companies. His will was a fiat, not only as to mu&s;ic but almo&s;t as to every thing el&s;e, though he was very little more than an arrogant pretending buffoon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French writer under the idea of a letter received from the Ely&s;ian Fields, gives the following de&s;cription of LULLY: Upon a &s;ort of litter compo&s;ed of ordure and rotten laurels, appeared carried by twelve &s;atyrs, a little &s;lovenly ill looking man. He had &s;mall red eyes, which could &s;carcely be &s;een, and out of which he could &s;carcely &s;ee. They emitted, however, a &s;ort of cloudy fire, in which could be di&s;covered a mixture of &s;hrewdne&s;s and malignity. His exterior was all gaiety, but it was perpetually checked with inward inquietude. To &s;ervility, bu&s;&s;oonery, and ob&s;cenity, he joined ar|rogance, pride, and pre&s;umption; and I was not a&s;toni&s;hed, upon enquiring who this pu&s;&s;ed up manikin could be, to learn that he was nothing more than a drunken fidler.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the opera, it will be generally
<PB N="13" REF="11">
nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ociate the names of QUINAULT and LULLY. In 1673. they brought out <HI>Cadmus,</HI> which was performed <HI>au Jeu de paulme de Bel Air;</HI> but LULLY, ever attentive to his intere&s;t, no &s;ooner heard of MOLIERE's death than he &s;et every engine to work to procure a grant from the king of MO|LIERE's theatre. This with very little difficulty he obtained, and <HI>Cadmus</HI> was the fir&s;t opera brought out on the theatre of the Palais Royal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus there had been three regular theatres:&mdash;one at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> one at <HI>Du Marais,</HI> and one at the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> and they continued to perform upon &s;eparate foundations until the death of MOLIERE, which happened in February 1673. This company, who could not &s;upport them&s;elves after the death of their chief, divided, and by incorporating them&s;elves into the other two companies, gave them great additional &s;trength. The theatre <HI>au Marais</HI> &s;oon after|wards quitted that &s;ituation, and opened a new hou&s;e in <HI>La Rue Ma|zarine,</HI> where the king &s;ent all the &s;cenes and decorations which MO|LIERE had u&s;ed in the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> being &s;ituated oppo&s;ite <HI>la rue Guenegaud.</HI> This hou&s;e was callad the theatre <HI>de Guenegaud.</HI> On the twenty-fir&s;t of October, however, 1680, the king united the two companies, fixed him&s;elf the number of actors, allotted their different &s;hares of the profits, according to their re&s;pective merits, di&s;charged &s;ome, gave others pen&s;ions, and regulated the whole economy of this new &s;ociety, who were be&s;ides gratified out of his privy pur&s;e with a pen&s;ion of twelve thou&s;and livres.</NOTE>, though &s;ome contend that <HI>Alce&s;te</HI> was the fir&s;t, which ap|peared in 1674. This, however, is not probable, or if it were, it is hardly worth enquiring into.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;&eacute;e</HI> came out in 1675; and on the following
<PB N="14" REF="12">
year <HI>Atys,</HI> one of the mo&s;t celebrated operas of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates, in which there is certainly &s;ome beautiful lyric writing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LOUIS the fourteenth a&s;ked Madame MAINTENON which of all the operas &s;he liked be&s;t. She an&s;wered <HI>Atys.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Atys,</HI> Madam,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline">"is too happy."</Q></NOTE>. This piece had a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s. It was, however, according to cu&s;tom bitterly at|tacked by DESPREAUX, of who&s;e judgment, as a critic, I cannot give a better proof than that which follows: When this &s;atyri&s;t went to the repre&s;enta|tion of this opera at VERSAILLES, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"put me,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in &s;ome corner where it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me to hear the words. I admire the mu&s;ic of LULLY, but I have a &s;overeign contempt for the ver&s;es of QUINAULT<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Incomparable critic! Admire mu&s;ic compo&s;ed on purpo&s;e to give force and expre&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e words which he held in contempt.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>I&s;is</HI> followed <HI>Atys</HI> in 1677, and <HI>Pro&s;erpine</HI> in 1680, but <HI>Per&s;&eacute;e</HI> which came out in 1682, was one of the mo&s;t famous operas produced by the&s;e allies. COR|NEILLE, however, had treated the &s;ame &s;ubject in a piece called <HI>Andromede.</HI> A number of fortunate circum&s;tances combined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of this piece. Among the re&s;t the audience were mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the young prince DEI|TRICHTEIN, the elde&s;t &s;on of the prince of that name, grand ma&s;ter of his imperial maje&s;ty, dance
<PB N="15" REF="13">
with an elegance and a grace which gave univer&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment. He appeared on the theatre ma&s;ked, as was then the cu&s;tom, and took alternately the &s;ituation of all the principal dancers.</P>
<P>The concour&s;e of people who &s;locked to &s;ee this prince was incredible, and what renders the circum&s;tance &s;till more wonderful is, that though he excelled every other dancer, he had not been taught more than a year.</P>
<P>The king had this opera performed in an <HI>oran|gerie,</HI> where the di&s;po&s;ition of real trees, a foun|tain, and other natural objects, curiou&s;ly and ju|diciou&s;ly arranged gave a mo&s;t delicious effect to the &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>All the beauties of the court were invited, and every po&s;&s;ible care taken and expence lavi&s;hed to &s;hew the merit of the poet and compo&s;er to ad|vantage; all which merit LULLY, as u&s;ual, took to him&s;elf, and received the compliments of the king and the nobility, while the humble QUINAULT &s;tood at a di&s;tance, as little noticed as if he had been an indifferent &s;pectator. The words of the king to LULLY were,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he had never &s;een a piece where the mu&s;ic was &s;o equally good throughout."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="14">The very &s;ame year a brilliant <HI>fete</HI> was given to celebrate the birth of the Duke of BURGUNDY. LULLY, upon this occa&s;ion gave <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> gratis, and prevailed upon QUINAULT to introduce a great deal of novelty applicable to the event in honour of which the opera was performed; be&s;ides which he put him&s;elf to a prodigious expence. He had a triumphal arch, a firework, and a fixed &s;un of an a&s;toni&s;hing magnitude, containing &s;everal thou&s;and lamps; after which there was a di&s;charge of mu&s;|ketry, and, to fini&s;h all, a fountain that ran with wine, Who, after this, could deny that <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> was the &s;ole production of LULLY?</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e adventitious circum&s;tances all that gave advantage to <HI>Per&s;eus;</HI> it begat a &s;pirited controver&s;y, which the ladies very warmly entered into, and in&s;i&s;ted that <HI>Pheneus's</HI> expre&s;&s;ion that he would rather &s;ee ANDROMEDA devoured by the mon&s;ter, than in the arms of his rival, was void of gallantry, and therefore ought not to be uttered on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>This di&s;pute was &s;o followed up that all the public prints of the times were full of it. No wonder then that an opera, &s;o much prai&s;ed and condemned, &s;hould be the con&s;tant topic, and that therefore, either through prejudice, or partiality&mdash;motives
<PB N="17" REF="15">
equally advantageous&mdash;all PARIS made a point of attending it.</P>
<P>After <HI>Per&s;&eacute;e</HI> came <HI>Phaeton,</HI> in 1683; <HI>Amadis de Gaule,</HI> in 1684; <HI>Le Temple de la Paix,</HI> in 1685; <HI>Roland,</HI> al&s;o in 1685; and <HI>Armide,</HI> in 1686. Im|mediately after the production of this la&s;t opera, QUINAULT, heartily tired of LULLY, retired from the theatre.</P>
<P>It may truly be &s;aid, that though the enthu&s;ia&s;m cau&s;ed by the mu&s;ic of LULLY aro&s;e from no other rea&s;on than that mu&s;ic had till that time in FRANCE been of the mo&s;t contemptible kind; yet he merits a large &s;hare of prai&s;e for reducing it to a &s;ort of &s;landard, which proved a good ground work for the improvements afterwards made in it by RAMEAU and others. But none of this would have been effected had not QUINAULT &s;tarted up the only French poet, in &s;pight of the ill nature and the ignorance of BOILEAU, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a true genius for this &s;pecies of lyric poetry.</P>
<P>The&s;e men led very different lives; and while QUINAULT lived honoured and re&s;pected, and died lamented and regretted, LULLY was laughed at and de&s;pi&s;ed in his life time, and dete&s;ted and exe|crated after his death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The death of LULLY was cau&s;ed by an accident. He com|po&s;ed a <HI>Te Deum</HI> on the recovery of the king; and, in the heighth of his enthu&s;ia&s;m, beating time very violently with his cane, he &s;truck it forcibly again&s;t his foot, and his frame being at all times, from his debaucheries, in a corrupt and di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, a gangrene en|&s;ued which carried him off.</P>
<P>Among other in&s;tances of LULLY's total want of principle and morality, we are told that fancying him&s;elf in extremity he &s;ent for a confe&s;&s;or, who informed him he had no chance of being &s;aved unle&s;s he threw his la&s;t opera in the fire. This he in&s;tantly complied with; but getting apparently better, and being reproached by one of the princes, who came to &s;ee him, with having burnt his opera, <Q REND="inline">"Oh,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was not &s;uch a fool in that bu&s;ine&s;s as you imagine. I knew what I was about. I have a copy and &s;o the prie&s;t was cheated."</Q>
He grew wor&s;e however; and finding his death ap|proach he not only burnt his re&s;erved copy, but &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to be laid upon a heap of a&s;hes with a halter round his neck, and to expiate his offence, as he imagined, &s;ung to one of his own airs the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Il faut mourir, pecheur, Il faut mourir.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>While he was ill, the Chevalier de LORRAINE came to &s;ee him, and in an affectionate way lamented his &s;ituation, and made him a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip. Oh yes, truly, &s;aid the wife of LULLY, you are a very kind friend to him! It was you who made him drunk the la&s;t, and will be the cau&s;e of his death.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hold your tongue,"</Q>
&s;aid LULLY,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'tis very kind of the Chevalier. He was the la&s;t that made me drunk, and in return he &s;hall be the fir&s;t that I'll make drunk if I e&s;cape this illne&s;s."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16">Among the operas of QUINAULT and LULLY, it was &s;aid that <HI>Atys</HI> was the opera for the king, <HI>Armide,</HI> for the ladies, <HI>Phaeton</HI> for the public in general, and <HI>I&s;is</HI> for mu&s;icians.</P>
<P>Many other operas, written by QUINAULT, and compo&s;ed by LULLY, were performed with various

&s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LULLY the father having had &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, LULLY the &s;on attempted to profit by the family reputation.&mdash;Finding, however, no QUINAULT who would permit him to &s;poil his pieces, the only opera he ever attempted, which was called <HI>Orpheus,</HI> and written by BOU|LAY, drew on him in deri&s;ion an epigram, a rondeau, and a &s;ong; for he had &s;uch influence that the audience were forbid by the court to hi&s;s, therefore they were obliged to damn <HI>Orpheus</HI> through the me|dium of the new&s;papers.</NOTE>. At length many of the be&s;t authors adven|tured in this &s;pecies of writing, and MOLIERE, QUIN|AULT, PIERRE, and T. CORNEILLE wrote <HI>P&s;yche</HI> in conjunction; and there is another <HI>P&s;yche,</HI> which has been pretty generally given to FONTENELLE. At length, when the opera became more e&s;tabli&s;hed, and RAMEAU was the favourite compo&s;er<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">RAMEAU found it very difficult to e&s;tabli&s;h a mu&s;ical reputation. The French had been &s;o u&s;ed to the monotony of LULLY, that they had no reli&s;h for the diver&s;ity of RAMEAU. Thus it happened that he was obliged to compo&s;e what words he could get. One of his fir&s;t attempts was an opera by an anonymous author called <HI>Paladins.</HI> One of the &s;ongs was &s;et to &s;uch quick mu&s;ic that the words could not be heard.&mdash;The &s;inger complained of this. RAMEAU replied he did it out of kindne&s;s to the author, for that in rendering the words unintelligible, he had acted towards him with the greate&s;t friend&s;hip.</NOTE>, the be&s;t geniu&s;es wrote for that &s;pectacle; nay even VOLTAIRE was tempted to adventure in it, and thereby undertook what he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es he did not under&s;tand.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ITALIAN THEATRE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Italian theatre, as it always has been called, will hereafter make up a con&s;iderable part of French dramatic exhibitions, it will be extremely proper in in this place to give &s;ome account of it, and al&s;o of all tho&s;e inferior dramatic objects which branched out from that &s;trange heterogeneous amu&s;ement which, like our opera, was originally performed in a language the natives did not under&s;tand. Nay till very lately the love &s;cenes, in &s;ome of tho&s;e come|dies, have been occa&s;ionally performed in Italian. In 1577, a troop of Italian comedians called <HI>Le Gelo&s;i,</HI> performed at the <HI>Hotel de Bourbon,</HI> but they had no fixed e&s;tabli&s;hment, and after &s;ome years they were replaced by another, who, in their turn, were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in 1662. It was after this that an Italian troop were permitted to perform alternately with the troop of MOLIERE <HI>au petit Bourbon,</HI> where they continued till 1697, when the king thought proper to &s;hut up their theatre.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="20">The variety of difficulties the Italian comedians laboured under to procure leave for their perfor|mances, obliged them to exhau&s;t invention for ex|pedients to combat the laws then in force. The fir&s;t of the&s;e expedients was an attempt to evade an ac|cu&s;ation of performing regular pieces. This they effected by taking an outline of the plot of the piece, together with all the nicer immediate circum|&s;tances; and having got this perfectly by heart, to &s;upply the dialogue extempore. By this means the &s;ame &s;cene was never literally performed twice alike, e&s;pecially as they frequently changed parts with each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e pieces were the invention of the two RICOBONIES, fa|ther and &s;on, and, to &s;ay truth, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one very extraordinary merit. The words coming from the actors extemporaneou&s;ly, they had a vivacity, a glow, a fire, unknown to tho&s;e dialogues which are &s;tudied. This however was not new for it had been done in Spain. The comedians who compo&s;ed this troop were almo&s;t all authors, and through a lively and fertile imagination, they filled their parts with uncommon eclat. The contrary, however, was too often the ca&s;e, for it is ea&s;ily &s;een that a &s;ingle novice might di&s;concert the mo&s;t ingenious e&s;&s;u&s;ions of imagination.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this and other expedients, the Italian theatre was &s;hut up for nineteen years, and after this they were &s;o di&s;per&s;ed that it was not ex|pected they would ever again rally in FRANCE. The Duc D'ORLEANS, however, at that time
<PB N="23" REF="21">
Regent, &s;ent for others, who arrived in PARIS in 1716. He gave in&s;tructions to M. ROUILLE, <HI>Coun&s;eiller d'Etat,</HI> to procure the be&s;t performers from ITALY. It will ea&s;ily be believed the ta&s;k was not difficult. Indeed with &s;uch alacrity did they pour in from all quarters, that the company was very &s;oon complete, and the regent, till the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne</HI> could be got ready, permitted them to perform at the <HI>Palais Royal</HI> on &s;uch days as there was no opera.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth of May, 1716, they opened their theatre with a piece called <HI>L'Heureu&s;e Surprize,</HI> and on the twentieth of the &s;ame month their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment was announced by an order from the king. The fir&s;t day of the following June they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the theatre of the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> under the title of the comedians in ordinary to his Royal Highne&s;s Mon&s;ieigneur le Duc D'ORLEANS, Regent, and that prince dying, on the &s;econd of De|cember, 1723, the company obtained the title of the KING's <HI>Italian comedians in ordinary,</HI> with a pen&s;ion of fifteen thou&s;and livres. This obtained, they put the king's arms upon the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> and above it, in black marble, this in&s;cription in letters of gold.</P>

<P>The theatres that were erected at the Fairs, <HI>St. Germain,</HI> and <HI>St. Laurent,</HI> though an inferior kind, were neverthele&s;s productive of great improvement in dramatic humour; and al&s;o bringing forward actors and actre&s;&s;es of great and particular merit. Engli&s;h travellers at that time flocked with plea&s;ure to &s;ee the buffoon and grote&s;que acting of DOMINIQUE in <HI>Harlequin,</HI> the &s;imple and <HI>naive</HI> deportment of BELLONI in <HI>Pierrot,</HI> the humour and <HI>fine&s;&s;e</HI> of Madamoi&s;elle de LISLE in the waiting maids, the plea&s;ant awkwardne&s;s of DESGRANGES in <HI>Scara|mouch,</HI> the &s;ingular figure of PAGHETTI, in old men, and the noble and mode&s;t air of Madamoi&s;elle MO|LIN, in the characters of wards and daughters.</P>
<P>In all countries the be&s;t writers have been, at different times, ill treated by managers. LE SAGE, D'ORNEVAL, PANNARD, PIRON, and BOISSY led the way for almo&s;t a total de&s;ertion of the theatre, in favour of the fair; which boa&s;ted at length the added names of FAVARD, ANSEAUME, DOMINI|QUE, LE GRAND, FAGAN, DELAFOND, PONTAU, VADE, and SEDAINE. The trifles they produced being excellent in their kind, and in a &s;tyle per|fectly different from the general run of dramatic
<PB N="25" REF="23">
entertainments, and al&s;o produced by &s;ome of the be&s;t writers, made the fairs, for forty years, the fir&s;t object of amu&s;ement in FRANCE.</P>
<P>The theatres feeling &s;everely the effect of their own inferiority, were obliged to have re|cour&s;e to a number of expedients, if not to &s;up|pre&s;s the pieces performed at the fair, at lea&s;t to le&s;&s;en their value. For this purpo&s;e they were per|petually tea&s;ing the magi&s;trates, who, at different times, upon being properly applied to, i&s;&s;ued &s;everal mandates to forbid &s;uch parts of the performances as were mo&s;t likely to be applauded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon one of the&s;e occa&s;ions mu&s;ic was ab&s;olutely forbidden; in con&s;equence of this they were obliged to &s;upply what they could, in which they were generally, by implication, pretty &s;evere on their oppre&s;&s;ors. One night in the middle of a &s;cene an a&s;s was heard to bray&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Hold your tongue,"</Q> &s;aid Harlequin,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you'll bring us into a &s;crape. Don't you know we are forbid to have mu&s;ic."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This only &s;erved to &s;timulate their exertions, and to rou&s;e them to fre&s;h ingenuity. Being forbidden to perform in dialogue, they were, for &s;ome &s;hort time, reduced to exhibit every thing by ge&s;ture, through which they &s;everely and &s;ucce&s;sfully ridi|culed their enemies. They could not hope, how|ever, to perform long in this manner to any great advantage; and, therefore, applied to the &s;ydnies
<PB N="26" REF="24">
and the doctors of the royal academy of mu&s;icians, who permitted them to perform &s;hort pieces, partly dialogue, and partly &s;ongs, and occa&s;ionally a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by dances.&mdash;The&s;e &s;pectacles were called the Comic Opera, of which &s;pecies of amu&s;ement the admirable author of <HI>Gil Blas</HI> may be con&s;idered as the father.</P>
<P>Flattered with the great &s;ucce&s;s he had met with on the &s;tage, and irritated with the avarice and folly of the managers, he devoted him&s;elf entirely to this &s;lighter &s;pecies of dramatic employment. Many of his pieces were in great mea&s;ure written from mo|tives of revenge, and &s;uch were generally parodies of the new tragedies, which no &s;ooner appeared on the theatre, than they were humourou&s;ly and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully ridiculed at the fair. The be&s;t authors &s;marted, and mo&s;t &s;everely too, under this tea&s;ing rod of critici&s;m. Among the re&s;t, Mr. VOLTAIRE, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of his <HI>Semiramis,</HI> certainly felt it with the greate&s;t keenne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>VOLTAIRE was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure le&s;t his <HI>Semiramis</HI> &s;hould be parodied.

<P>Without a comment, I give this as genuine from VOLTAIRE, who pretended to laugh at the malice of all the world.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="25">The&s;e comic writers, however, drew on them|&s;elves, by the &s;everity of their &s;atires, a ho&s;t of ene|mies, and were forbid to perform any pieces in which there was either &s;peaking or &s;inging. This only convinced the world that they were complete adepts in their bu&s;ine&s;s; for, immediately &s;etting their wits to work, they invented a &s;pecies of amu&s;e|ment
<PB N="28" REF="26">
which, from its extraordinary novelty, had the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. It was written in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, and thus performed:</P>
<P>Two actors came on the &s;tage with as many rolls of parchment as there were &s;peeches in the &s;cene they were to perform. The&s;e rolls were numbered, and on each, written in large characters, what they had to &s;ay. The&s;e they alternately di&s;played, which, being read by the audience, exhibited, in very la|conic terms, &s;ome witty colloquy, e&s;pecially as the&s;e writings in great mea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted of humorous apologies for their being under the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to &s;o incomplete an expedient.</P>
<P>When the audience had &s;een enough of this vi&s;ual dialogue, large rolls of canvas were &s;o di&s;|played by two figures of boys, who &s;eemed playing in the air, that the &s;pectators could completely read the words of a &s;ong, As &s;oon as it became com|pletely vi&s;ible, the orche&s;tra began a well known air, which &s;ome actor, placed either in the <HI>parterre,</HI> or the boxes, began to &s;ing. The audience &s;oon took the hint, and after a time it was no uncommon thing for the whole of the &s;pectators to join in every chorus.</P>
<P>The matter was, in proportion to the &s;ingularity

of the exigence, mo&s;t wonderfully managed; but, after all, it is very evident that they laboured under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages; and, at length, by the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5 letters">i&s;hment of the regular Italian comedians in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, who were joined by &s;ome of the be&s;t per|fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mers at the fair, this memorable era of humour and plea&s;antry on the French &s;tage, became ap|parently extract; but it, however, left &s;uch traces of real humour, fertile imagination and happy &s;a|tire, that there has been &s;carcely a comic opera written &s;ince in FRANCE, that has not kept in view the &s;pecies of intrigue invented by this extra|ordinary &s;et of ingenious men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Even after the Italian theatre had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1716, it laboured under difficulties; for, growing into fa&s;hion, the French actors complained that the Italians &s;hould perform in any other than their own language. This complaint was carried to the king, who de&s;ired to hear both parties. BARON, in the name of the French actors, &s;poke fir&s;t. This done the king made a &s;ign to DOMINIQUE, the Harlequin, to &s;peak in his turn. <Q REND="inline">"In what language may it plea&s;e your maje&s;ty am I to &s;peak?"</Q> &s;aid DOMINIQUE. <Q REND="inline">"In any language you will,"</Q> &s;aid the king. <Q REND="inline">"Oh!"</Q> &s;aid the Harlequin, <Q REND="inline">"if that's the ca&s;e I have won my cau&s;e."</Q> The king would not recal his word, and after that time the Italians continued to perform without interruption.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Before we quit the &s;ubject of the fair, it is pro|per to &s;ay it began with puppets. After this ap|peared wild bea&s;ts, but it is curious to remark that a lion or a tiger was not con&s;idered as the &s;malle&s;t

rarity, if he could not perform &s;ome comical tricks. After the&s;e came giants who mu&s;t al&s;o be buffoons, otherwi&s;e they had no attention paid them. On this account, the common animals which we &s;ee every day were the greate&s;t favourites. Dogs, cats, and monkies, did more than the be&s;t actors and actre&s;&s;es that ever appeared, and the&s;e for a time were put out of countenance by &s;light-of-hand men, tumblers, and rope-dancers.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, however, be remembered, to the ho|nour of the fair, that it gave birth to the mo&s;t elegant dancing in FRANCE. Madmoi&s;elle de LISLE, who joined the mo&s;t refined ta&s;te and exe|cution in &s;erious dancing to the mo&s;t charming &s;prightline&s;s in demi-character, and the &s;tronge&s;t con|ception and di&s;crimination in dances of character and expre&s;&s;ion, may be reckoned among the earlie&s;t proofs that the French were born eminently to rival all other nations in that accompli&s;hed&mdash;I will not, however, here &s;ay how far u&s;eful&mdash;art.</P>
<P>Madmoi&s;elle SALLE, who cau&s;ed &s;o long the admiration of PARIS, and at length retired with the applau&s;e of her country, was al&s;o an <HI>Eleve</HI> at the fair. Madmoi&s;elle RABON, that very celebrated dancer, was al&s;o bred up at the fair; and as for &s;ingers, it was the nur&s;ery of the theatre.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">Among other dancers who performed with great celebrity at the fair, was the father of our famous GRIMALDI. He had then ju&s;t fled from ITALY. He was called, for di&s;tinction, <HI>Iron Legs;</HI> and &s;up|po&s;ed to be the be&s;t jumper in the world: for even the ta&s;te of FRANCE, in its own proper profe&s;&s;ion has been at times vitiated. He once jumped &s;o high that he broke a chandelier; a piece of which hitting the Turki&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who was in the &s;tage box, he con&s;idered this conduct as a premeditated affront, and complained to the French court of the outrage. But the mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance concerning him was his being put in pri&s;on for in|decency on the FRENCH STAGE, which is a circum|&s;tance, when we con&s;ider the licence u&s;ed there, mo&s;t peculiarly extraordinary.</P>
<P>The French were certainly for a time in&s;atuated with GRIMALDI, but after the unlucky bu&s;ine&s;s of his impri&s;onment for indecency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I copy the following circum&s;tance from a French author.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Iron Legs had for a partner either his wife, his &s;i&s;ter, or his daugh|ter; for &s;o equivocal was the lady's character that no one has been able to a&s;certain the preci&s;e degree of relation&s;hip. This nymph was thought to be his &s;i&s;ter or daughter, for &s;he was remarkably like him; being a &s;quat, thick, &s;trong figure, and endowed with &s;o much agility and &s;trength that &s;he could break chandeliers al|mo&s;t as well as him&s;elf. Thus, as it was well known &s;he coha|bited with him as his wife, the remainder of the conjecture&mdash;his character being pretty well authenticated&mdash;became more probable."</Q></NOTE>, he began
<PB N="32" REF="30">
to lo&s;e ground, and at length was obliged to &s;troll into FLANDERS, where, however, he proved a &s;ource of riches to his confederates, for the Flan|derkins, as he added legerdemain and other tricks to his jumping, thought him &s;ome &s;upernatural being<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When GRIMALDI was obliged to decamp into FLANDERS, he and his troop were attacked near BRUSSELS by a banditti. The baggage waggon was ran&s;acked, their pockets turned in&s;ide out, and, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, the thieves were about to di&s;patch their prey. It &s;hould be known that GRIMALDI wanting money for his expedition, enticed one FLAHAUT, a book&s;eller, to follow his fortunes. FLAHAUT, having learnt Latin, took it into his head that it would be a good thing to introduce the ancient chorus on the &s;tage, by way of explaining GRIMALDI's dances. GRIMALDI appeared to approve the &s;cheme, but told him as it was a kind of improvement that could only be brought about by degrees, he had better learn to dance fir&s;t, which would make him immediately u&s;eful. FLAHAUT &s;et to work, and GRIMALDI promi&s;ed to make him a capital dancer. In the end, he got as much money together as he could, left his fa|mily, and, as I &s;aid, followed GRIMALDI. When the fabres of the banditti were drawn to di&s;patch the troop of dancers, GRIMALDI, who at the danger of his life would have his joke, whi&s;pered FLA|HAUT to talk Latin to them.&mdash;The enthu&s;ia&s;t, FLAHAUT, began; and for a few &s;econds the &s;abres were &s;u&s;pended. Pre&s;ently loudly vociferating <HI>dixi,</HI> one of them aiming a blow at his head, cried <HI>feci</HI>; which blow, had it taken place, mu&s;t have &s;ilenced the orator for ever. But the mo&s;t extraordinary part of the adventure remains to be told. GRIMALDI's partner, the lady before commemorated, in all the furor of romantic heroi&s;m, ju&s;t as the word di&s;patch had been uttered, &s;tept forward, and, in a &s;cream of de&s;pair, implored the banditti to have pity on her comrades; offering that if they would be merciful, &s;he would yield her&s;elf up a &s;acrifice, and devote her&s;elf to their plea&s;ure. She de&s;cribed how many ways &s;he could be u&s;eful to them; that &s;he could dance to amu&s;e them, &s;he could cook for them, and, to be brief, intimated, in the language of DEBORAH WOODCOCK, that &s;he had no objection to any work they could put her to. In &s;hort, the thieves were appea&s;ed, and carried off the lady in triumph, but not till they had &s;tript the whole troop &s;tark naked, leaving them nothing but the refu&s;e of what they had pillaged from baggage waggon, con&s;i&s;ting of a few odds and ends of pantomime dre&s;&s;es. GRIMALDI put on an old Harlequin's jacket, poor FLA|HAUT contented him&s;elf with the trow&s;ers of Scaramouch, and in this plight they begged their way to BRUSSELS.</NOTE>.</P>

What had formerly plea&s;ed, however, was no longer reli&s;hed, and they were, at one time, upon the point of returning to ITALY. What follows is the &s;ub&s;tance of a &s;peech &s;poken by Harlequin to the audience.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ladies and Gentlemen, they make me play all &s;orts of parts, and I know many of them ought to di&s;gu&s;t you.

combat new manners, a new language, and a new &s;pecies of entertainment. In &s;hort, we have only yet been at &s;chool, and the public have very pro|perly kept away from us, till we made our&s;elves perfect. The ladies, without whom the be&s;t elo|quence langui&s;hes and dies, have withdrawn from us their &s;upport, and how can we expect any men of gallantry to attend us?</P>
<P>"The pieces we have performed were ta&s;ted formerly; but it was folly to &s;uppo&s;e that what delighted a barbarous age &s;hould plea&s;e an en|lightened one. We mean, therefore, to abandon them, to &s;ub&s;titute others more to your ta&s;te, and, as the public are always equitable, we fear not your indulgence &s;o much as our own ina|bility. What little merit we have &s;hall be &s;tre|nuou&s;ly exerted to give you plea&s;ure; in the mean time, we are producing every day in our children young actors and actre&s;&s;es, who, though they inherit Italian abilities, are yet natives of FRANCE, and may perfect the celebrity of the theatre; all which advantages would be lo&s;t if we were compelled to go to our own country.</P>
<P>"Deign, therefore, to con&s;ider, at pre&s;ent, our intentions, that hereafter you may applaud our merits. Hitherto you have been indulgent at

<P>This &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect; the public intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the affairs of the comedians, and &s;ome of the be&s;t authors having advi&s;ed them to perform the mo&s;t celebrated among the pieces given at the fair, they very &s;oon got into reputation. At length, many writers of eminence lent their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and their children, as they had predicted, grew up, and were mo&s;t accompli&s;hed actors. Indeed the re|putation of the Italian theatre eclip&s;ed that of the French. to which St. FOIX, MARIVAUX, and other eminent authors did not a little contribute.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance which happened about this time went a great way towards e&s;tabli&s;hing the reputation of the Italian theatre at PARIS. The convale&s;cence of the king after a dangerous illne&s;s, gave occa&s;ion for every exertion of loyalty throughout the king|dom; but the &s;pirit of the Italians was very re|markable; they erected a mo&s;t magnificent tran&s;pa|rency before the <HI>Facade</HI> of their theatre; they built up a temporary &s;tage on the balcony over it, whence their band did not cea&s;e to play, or their troop to dance, during the greate&s;t part of the night; and as the whole tendency of their performance was to com|pliment
<PB N="37" REF="35">
the king, and congratulate the people on his recovery, as many as could be collected on the &s;pot joined their &s;houts of <HI>Vive le Roi</HI> in time to the mu&s;ic, as often as it was introduced; and that their mirth might not want an incentive, ci&s;terns of wine were placed in a convenient manner, to &s;upply the populace.</P>
<P>On the day that <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung at <HI>Notre Dame,</HI> the Italians recommenced the rejoicings. The tran&s;parency erected before their theatre was &s;o ma&s;terly both in conception and execution, that it is really worthy of particular de&s;cription:&mdash;Within a circular decoration, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ymbolical orna|ments, was painted the temple of IRIS, &s;urrounded with a beautiful rainbow, on which appeared the godde&s;s with all her attributes.</P>
<P>The illuminations which accompanied this grand picture formed three arcades, &s;upported by pila&s;ters, all of the ru&s;tic order. Between the arcades <HI>Vive le Roi</HI> was &s;u&s;pended in large characters. Above the pila&s;ters were placed four pyramids, ornamented with &s;treams of fire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was effected by rows of lamps placed before rever|berators.</NOTE>, which gave an un&s;peakable effect. The in&s;ide of the temple was entirely tran&s;parent,
<PB N="38" REF="36">
and nobly de&s;igned, as well as the rainbow and the figure of IRIS.</P>
<P>In the middle of the temple was placed a por|trait of the king, under a figure of APOLLO, &s;ur|rounded with his ordinary &s;ymbols. Over his head the words POST NUBILA PHOEBUS, and on the two &s;ides of APOLLO were the figures of Peace and Plenty. From the extremity of the erection were carried two pyramids, which completed the grandeur of the whole to a degree of wonder; they were of them&s;elves fifty-two feet high, and at the ba&s;e fifty feet wide, tapering, as they a&s;cended, to a point.</P>
<P>To enumerate all the prodigious variety of de|vices which were contained in the paintings on the pyramids would take up much more room than I ought to allow. It is enough to &s;ay that they were all tran&s;parent, and di&s;tributed about in the mo&s;t fanciful and charming order, being interlaced with innumerable lamps, placed before reverberators. To the BRUNETTIS, father and &s;on, famous Italian painters, was confided the execution of the whole, who had now brought &s;cenery in FRANCE to that perfection which has ever &s;ince made it the ad|miration of all other nations.</P>
<P>The&s;e comedians al&s;o gave upon the&s;e occa&s;ions

three new pieces, called the <HI>Illumination,</HI> the <HI>Village Wedding,</HI> and the <HI>Sincere Revels.</HI> They were written by PANNARD, and performed with all the &s;ucce&s;s that could be expected from an event &s;o naturally intere&s;ting.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>ANCIENTLY in FRANCE we have &s;een that all the authors were actors. The Trouverres, the Trou|badours, the Pilgrims, and even the Prie&s;ts pe|&s;onated different characters; and we find them at the head of their re&s;pective companies acting, &s;ing|ing, or po&s;turing, according to the nature of the &s;pectacle they undertook to exhibit. In the <HI>My|&s;teries,</HI> the <HI>Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> were all ac|tors. When the <HI>My&s;teries</HI> had yielded to the <HI>Mo|rali&s;ts,</HI> the performers were partly the prie&s;ts and partly the laiety. By the time the <HI>Children of Sans Souci</HI> joined this confedracy, and they were forbid to perform any other than profane &s;ubjects that had a moral tendency, the prie&s;ts retired from the &s;tage, and the laiety had exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>The retirement of the prie&s;ts &s;eemed to be the &s;ignal for improvement. The tragedies of JODELLE and the re&s;t mu&s;t have boa&s;ted much more regular actors than the rhap&s;odies that preceded them; de|clamation,
<PB N="41" REF="39">
however, was all that yet could be ex|pected. It &s;hould &s;eem, indeed, that till then the employment of an actor had never been con&s;idered as a profe&s;&s;ion of it&s;elf, for we are told, and particu|larly by MAROT, who died before JODELLE, that a man, who&s;e epitaph he had written, of the name of SERRE, was the fir&s;t regular actor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JODELLE did for MAROT what MAROT had done for SERRE. He al&s;o publi&s;hed his works on a variety of &s;ubjects, in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">42.

</LG></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to women, we have &s;een JODELLE obliged to per&s;onate his own <HI>Cleopatra;</HI> and, if credit can be given to the be&s;t French authorities, a woman of the name of BEAUPRE was the fir&s;t actre&s;s in FRANCE, who might certainly have performed in the pieces written by HARDY, but not earlier, for &s;he was very old and had retired from the &s;tage before CORNEILLE brought out <HI>Melite.</HI> She is reported to have &s;aid to CORNEILLE that times were changed; for that before he wrote the pieces were mi&s;erable, and the performers excellent, but that &s;ince he had written, the pieces were excellent, and the per|formers mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="40">We have the names of PONT ALAIS, GRINGORE, and others who mu&s;t have been cotemporaries of SERRE, for they are reported to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the <HI>My&s;teries,</HI> and being excellent buffoons, they were perpetually quarrelling with the prie&s;ts. In&s;tead of announcing their amu&s;ements by bills it was then the cu&s;tom, as we have formerly &s;een it in ENGLAND, to beat a drum about the &s;treets; and the&s;e men having done &s;o one day to the great annoyance of a prie&s;t, who was preaching, and who had a grudge again&s;t them, he came out of the church and demanded how they came to be &s;o audacious as to beat a drum while he was preaching. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I may as well a&s;k you,"</Q> &s;aid PONT ALAIS,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how you came to be &s;o audacious as to preach while I was beating my drum; we are both following our occupations."</Q>
The prie&s;t, how|ever, to &s;hew who had the upper hand, complained to the magi&s;trates, and the actor was impri&s;oned for &s;ix months<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PONT ALAIS was hunch-backed; and &s;eeing a Cardinal one day in the &s;treet, who was built upon the &s;ame principle, he ran again&s;t him as if by accident.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but you &s;ee two mountains may meet notwith&s;tanding the proverb."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have the names of other actors before HAR|DY, but we know little of their merit. During his time, however, at the head of a numerous company we find TURLUPIN, GAUTHIER, GARGUILLE, HAUDOIN, BONIFACE, CAPITAINE, and others,
<PB N="43" REF="41">
who are &s;aid to have been very celebrated; but it &s;hould &s;eem by this that the productions of HARDY, which were generally called tragedies, mu&s;t have been full of buffoonery; for TURLUPIN, who, from 1583 to 1634, was a principal performer in that com|pany, was a mere buffoon, The word <HI>turlupinade</HI> taken from his name, having been from that time to this incorporated into the French language as a term implying a filly je&s;t.</P>
<P>GARGUILLE &s;ucceeded TURLUPIN, and HAU|DOIN, GARGUILLE, exactly in the &s;ame &s;teps. The latter is &s;aid to have learnt &s;o much of the jargon of phy&s;icians by performing doctors and apothecaries on the &s;tage, that he retired to MELUN without the &s;malle&s;t knowledge of phy&s;ic but technical terms, and there made a fortune in quality of phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>All this, however, &s;eems to have been reformed when CORNEILLE began to write for the &s;tage; for, notwith&s;tanding the hand&s;ome compliment of Madame BEAUPRE, and her predelection for the buffoonery ju&s;t de&s;cribed, which &s;he was plea&s;ed fa|cetiou&s;ly to call good acting, BELLEROSE, the hero for whom CORNEILLE wrote, and who, about 1685, became manager of the company at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> gave &s;o new and &s;o natural a turn to dra|matic repre&s;entation, both in tragedy and comedy,
<PB N="44" REF="42">
that, followed up by CHEVALIER, GUERON, BRE|COURT, and others, mummery and buffoonery &s;oon gave way to truth and nature, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BRECOURT had the misfortune to kill a coachman. He retired into HOLLAND, where he became an actor in a company belonging to the Prince of ORANGE; but being informed that the court of FRANCE had applied to the court of HOLLAND to give up &s;ome per|&s;on who had taken refuge in that country, he &s;u&s;pected he might be the per&s;on meant, and therefore returned and threw him&s;elf at the feet of the king, reminding him that upon a former occa&s;ion he had probably &s;aved his life by killing a wild boar that they had hunted. Your maje&s;ty &s;aid he even did me the honour to a&s;k if I was wounded. The king &s;miled, a&s;&s;ured him he was not the man who&s;e life he &s;ought, pardoned him, and ordered MOLIERE to take him again into his company.</NOTE></P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ucceeded MONTFLEURY, LA FLEUR, LA THUILLERIE, MONDORY, LA THORRIL|LIERE, JODELET, DU PARC, and his wife, CHAMP|MELE, and his wife, RAISIN, BEJART, and his wife and daughter, Madmoi&s;elle DESCEILLETS, BEAUCHATEAU, and at length the great BARON, who was called the French Ro&s;cius. The&s;e and others of inferior rank made up the companies <HI>Au Marais,</HI> at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> and the <HI>Palais Royal.</HI></P>
<P>MONTFLEURY was a man of family and page to the Duke of GUISE. He was held in great con&s;i|deration by per&s;ons of rank. The Cardinal de

<PB N="45" REF="43">
RICHELIEU in particular undertook the care and expence of his wedding, He had very brilliant abilities as an actor, and we have already &s;een that his exertions co&s;t him his life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MONTFLEURY con&s;idered his profe&s;&s;ion of an actor &s;o honoura|ble, that when his marriage articles were preparing, and he was de|&s;ired, being a man of family, to de&s;cribe in what manner he cho&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, he an&s;wered that it was not in the power of an|ce&s;tors to confer talents, and that the mo&s;t honourable title he de&s;ired to be known by was that of actor to the king.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LA FLEUR, who took the &s;ituation of MONT|FLEURY after his death, was an admirable actor, and in a more exten&s;ive way than his predece&s;&s;or. He is reported to have been the fir&s;t who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed what the French call <HI>des entrailles;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the art of feeling to make others feel. He married the daughter of an actor called GROS GUILLAUME, and left a &s;on who became a celebrated performer under the name of LA THUILLERIE.</P>
<P>MONDORY, a performer in tragedy, &s;u&s;tained a re&s;pectable &s;ituation, <HI>au Marais.</HI> He was &s;eized with an apoplexy, as he was performing the part of <HI>Herod</HI> in the <HI>Mariamne</HI> of TRISTAN, and &s;urvived but a few days.</P>
<P>LA THORILLIERE was a man of family, and was a captain in the cavalry, but thought proper to
<PB N="46" REF="44">
leave every other occupation to follow the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor. He was remarkable for performing equally well the parts of kings and pea&s;ants. He left behind him a &s;on and a grand&s;on, both of whom were actors.</P>
<P>JODELET was an admirable comic actor. His features were &s;o marked and &s;o grote&s;que, that when|ever he appeared he excited loud bur&s;ts of laughter, of which he &s;eemed perfectly uncon&s;cious. His hu|mour was very peculiar, and the authors, to give force to their characters, accommodated them&s;elves to it. Hence &s;everal of the pieces of that time were named after this actor; witne&s;s, <HI>Jodelet Maitre et Valet, Jodelet Soufflet&eacute;,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>DU PARC &s;ucceeded JODELET. His &s;ucce&s;s was at fir&s;t doubtful, though his merit was acknow|ledged; but, having performed an original part, a kind of utterer of bon mots, he hit upon a humour &s;o whimfical that he became a great favourite. He died the &s;ame year in which the world lo&s;t MO|LIERE. He had long, however, left the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> having followed his wife to the <HI>Hotel de Bour|gogne,</HI> as we have &s;een, through the connivance of BOILEAU and RACINE.</P>
<P>CHAMPMELE was a very mediocre performer,
<PB N="47" REF="45">
but he is celebrated, if celebrity may be that way acquired, for fathering other people's pieces, and other people's children. There were five or &s;ix pieces given to him, which appeared in the works of others, in particular <HI>La Coupe Enchantee,</HI> and <HI>Je vous prends &s;ans Verd,</HI> both of which are among the productions of LA FONTAINE, and <HI>Delie,</HI> which was undoubtedly written by VISE; but for the merit of the&s;e pieces, FONTAINE might have been a&s;hamed of his part; and, as to VISE, it is no great matter whether he wrote <HI>Delie</HI> or not, for he was as dull as CHAMPMELE.</P>
<P>As to the other accommodating part of his cha|racter, winking at his wife's infidelity, who was an incomparable actre&s;s, and a beautiful woman, I can only &s;ay he de&s;erves no pity, for every man of that convenient de&s;cription, ought to have an unfaithful wife. The lady is &s;aid to have dealt her favours pretty liberally. We have &s;een RACINE in love with her, and we are told that he was &s;ucceeded in her affections by the Count de CLERMONT TON|NERRE. This gave ri&s;e to an epigram, which, as it is impo&s;&s;ible on account of the names, to render with any effect into Engli&s;h, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe as it is.
<Q><LG TYPE="epigram">
<L>A la plus tendre amour elle fut de&s;tinee,</L>

<PB N="48" REF="46">
Madame CHAMPMELE is &s;aid to have been en|dowed with very extraordinary talents, together with a mo&s;t con&s;ummate knowledge of the world. Her manners were uncommonly elegant, and her con|ver&s;ation &s;weet and amiable. Her hou&s;e was the rendezvous for men of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit; but it has been &s;aid by way of plea&s;antry, that notwith|&s;tanding &s;o much temptation, except in the in&s;tance of her little &s;lip with TONNERRE, &s;he was con&s;tant to DESPREAUX, RACINE, LA CHAPELLE, VA|LINCOUR, LA FONTAINE, and&mdash;her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that CHAMPMELE meditated a &s;ingular revenge on his rivals, which induced BOILEAU to write the following epigram:
<Q><LG TYPE="epigram">
<L>De &s;ix amans contens et non jaloux,</L>
<L>Qui tour a tour &s;ervoient Madame CLAUDE,</L>
<L>Le moins volage etoit JEAN &s;on epoux:</L>

<L>Le jeu n'e&s;t &s;ur avec cette Ribande;</L>
<L>Ah! voulez-vous, JEAN, JEAN, nous gater tous!</L>
</LG></Q>
CHAMPMELE, we are told, outlived his mother and his wife, and &s;oon afterwards died in the following extraordinary manner. Coming out of the church of the Cordeliers, where he had been to put up two requiems for his departed mother and wife, the prie&s;t demanded the money. CHAMPMELE gave him a piece of thirty &s;ols, the requiems being ten &s;ols
<PB N="49" REF="47">
a piece, <Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"keep that to pay for my requiem and in&s;tantly dropped down and ex|pired."</Q></P>
<P>RAISIN was an actor of infinite merit. He was equal to any &s;tyle of comedy. He was called PROTEUS, not more for his facility of changing from part to part than for the variety he threw, into the part it&s;elf. To the&s;e &s;uperior talents he united an excellent under&s;tanding, and inexhau&s;tible gaiety and good humour. He was an admirable teller of a &s;tory, and his company was coveted by all ranks; a circum&s;tance proving in him that talents are as dangerous as they are enviable, for the plea&s;ures he courted were the cau&s;e of his death.</P>
<P>BEJART was him&s;elf but an indifferent actor, but his wife was a woman of great theatrical talents, and &s;hrewd and penetrating judgement. We have &s;een that MOLIERE, when he left the <HI>Illu&s;trious</HI> theatre to go into PROVINCE, cho&s;e her for his guide in his theatrical conduct. She, having before been accu&s;tomed to regulate a country company. Her attention to him and his intere&s;t was &s;o much to his &s;atisfaction that he married her daughter; who, under their in&s;tructions became a celebrated actre&s;s, and an excellent &s;inger.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="48">Some have endeavoured to &s;ully her character, and I am the more particular in mentioning this on account of having read an Engli&s;h hi&s;tory of MO|LIERE, where calumny is un&s;paringly dealt out on the head of this poor woman. The French, how|ever do her ju&s;tice, not one of whom, at lea&s;t that I have &s;een, and my perqui&s;itions have been pretty indu&s;trious, have hinted at any thing again&s;t her re|putation. It is true &s;he married four or five years after the death of MOLIERE, but her general con|duct in his life time, and the noble trait of duty, tenderne&s;s, and re&s;pect to his memory, which we witne&s;&s;ed at the time of his funeral, mu&s;t in every candid mind acquit her of any infidelity towards a man who&s;e alliance with her was a proud and en|viable di&s;tinction, and who&s;e affectionate and friendly attention to her and her family was warm and unre|mitting throughout his life.</P>
<P>Madmoi&s;elle DESOEILLETS was an actre&s;s of con&s;iderable merit. She was the original <HI>Hermione</HI> in RACINE's tragedy of <HI>Andromache,</HI> and performed the part with wonderful force and energy. CHAMP|MELE, however, who came after her, and who had more pathos and feeling, &s;ucceeded &s;o greatly that DESOEILLETS confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf conquered, which being told to the king he &s;aid it was a mi&s;take, for that they both performed the part admirably; but
<PB N="51" REF="49">
to repre&s;ent it to perfection, DESOEILLETS ought to play the two fir&s;t acts and CHAMPMELE the three la&s;t.</P>
<P>BEAUCHATEAU was a re&s;pectable actor, and had a &s;on who gave promi&s;e of uncommon talents both as an author and a performer; but at the age of fourteen he came to ENGLAND, where he ab|jured the Roman Catholic religion, and afterwards travelled into PERSIA, and was never after heard of.</P>
<P>It will be proper here to &s;peak of BARON, but to follow him through his career would lay me un|der the premature nece&s;&s;ity of introducing POISSON, D'ANCOURT, and a number of other actors, an ac|count of whom had better come when we have ex|amined tho&s;e pieces in which they performed. As BARON, however, was cotemporary with many of tho&s;e who are mentioned in this chapter, I &s;hall &s;peak of him previous to his quitting the theatre in 1691, when he retired with a pen&s;ion of a thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>This performer is allowed infinitely to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all who had gone before him. To &s;trong natural conception he added a &s;olid and deci&s;ive un|der&s;tanding; his figure was noble, his voice clear and powerful, his deportment was graceful and ma|je&s;tic,
<PB N="52" REF="50">
his manner varied and accommodating, and he never violated art unle&s;s to adorn nature.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The rules,"</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"forbid us to li&s;t the hands above the head, but if pa&s;&s;ion carries them there it is right; nature knows better than the rules."</Q>
ROUS|SEAU &s;ays that BARON gave new lu&s;tre to the beau|ties of RACINE, and threw a veil over the defects of PRADON.</P>
<P>BARON was certainly an actor of mo&s;t extra|ordinary talents, which he availed him&s;elf of every opportunity to ripen and perfect. Bred up under the eye of MOLIERE, it was impo&s;&s;ible not to benefit materially by the admirable precepts of &s;o excellent a ma&s;ter. This added to tho&s;e gifts, with which by nature he had been abundantly endowed, qualified him for every &s;tile of acting; and, except in what we call low comedy, a line he never at|tempted, he was allowed eminently to excel all others.</P>
<P>BARON wrote &s;everal pieces for the theatre, which have a &s;martne&s;s and &s;omething very pa&s;&s;able, but nothing more. His dialogue is lively, and his &s;cenes are varied; and having mixed a good deal in &s;ociety, his characters are generally natural; but they are rather &s;ketches than plays, traits than &s;cenes; and though taken ab&s;tractly they produced &s;tage
<PB N="53" REF="51">
effect, yet their flim&s;yne&s;s and want of con&s;equence rendered their &s;ucce&s;s weak, and their duration tran&s;itory.</P>
<P>A French author &s;ays that the public never allow a man merit more than in one way, and that though the writings of BARON ought to have en&s;ured him reputation, yet the&s;e meaner preten&s;ions are &s;o lo&s;t in the &s;plendour of his talents as an actor that, rather than be obliged to admire them, they don't chu&s;e to acknowledge them at all. For my part I cannot &s;ee this, though I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is a doctrine that ever has been held; for the more a man va|riou&s;ly &s;ucceeds the more he mu&s;t naturally be an object of public admiration; and this is particularly noticeable in MOLIERE, who&s;e &s;plendid talents as a writer, have never le&s;&s;ened his reputation as an actor.</P>
<P>I am afraid the friends of BARON have attempted to give him an over&s;trained reputation more &s;uitable to his vanity, which was in&s;ufferable, than propor|tioned to his talents. It was his common ob|&s;ervation that every hundred years produces a CAESAR, but that it takes two thou&s;and to produce a ROSCIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BARON's coachman and laquais one day being very ill treated by the &s;ervants of the Marquis de BIRON, he was determined to de|mand ju&s;tice, and for this purpo&s;e &s;ought out the Marquis, to whom he preferred his complaint. <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Mon&s;eigneur,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid he,

RACINE called it, in deri&s;ion, the &s;caffold of D'ANCOURT. He, however, &s;poke truth by ac|cident, for it happened to be the &s;caffold on which he ro&s;e to build his reputation.</NOTE>, &s;o extremely difficult was it to

attain any thing like the &s;tandard MOLIERE had &s;et up.</P>
<P>As to the rincings of BOISROBERT's muddy hypocrene, they had evaporated long before; and long before had cea&s;ed the drolls of SCARRON; which, though admirable in their way, were in com|mon with a multitude of other mixed productions cru&s;hed by the powerful genius of MOLIERE. BEN|SERADE had &s;o injured him&s;elf by his di&s;putes with this truly celebrated man, that he thought it more prudent to write &s;onnets and epigrams, and obtain patronage among the great, than bring out plays and ri&s;k the deci&s;ion of the public; and as to BOYER's left handed fame, it ought to be con&s;igned to oblivion with the impertinent prattling of VISE, who only made him&s;elf celebrated by cen&s;uring what he could not imitate. CHAPELLE was ju&s;t as much of a writer as a mu&s;ical amateur is of a leader of a band, and even LA FONTAINE, de&s;ervedly celebrated as he ever will be, and particularly for tho&s;e writings which he &s;o &s;olemnly abjured<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is for the world to decide whether the conduct of LULLY or LA FONTAINE was in this in&s;tance replete with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t folly. The intentions of the two men are out of the que&s;tion, and it is al|mo&s;t an in&s;ult to the memory of LA FONTAINE to couple his name with that mu&s;ical buffoon. LULLY's conduct in burning his opera in compliai&s;nce to the prie&s;t, when he had a copy in his clo&s;et, was full of knavery and impiety; but LA FONTAINE could have no mo|tive in abjuring the &s;entiments contained in his Tales, but to expiate what he felt as a crime of no le&s;s magnitude than having corrupted the morals of youth; and, taken in that point of view, &s;urely no|thing could be more meritorious. He a&s;&s;embled the academy, of which body he was a member; and in their hearing, and in that of a prie&s;t, at the time he conceived him&s;elf near his end, he execrated this incomparable book as an abominable work. He begged pardon of GOD, of the church, of the academy, and of all mankind for having publi&s;hed it, and in particular for having a &s;hort time before retouched a new edition, which had &s;old rapidly throughout EUROPE. LA FONTAINE &s;hould have con&s;idered, or if he was too mode&s;t, the academy &s;hould have con&s;idered for him, that neither the &s;entiments nor the circum&s;tances were his own, but that he had merely clothed old Tales from BOCACE and others in poetry, &s;o rare, &s;o neat, and &s;o winning, that the French language had attained nothing equal to it before, nor had it been to the time of this abjuration &s;ucce&s;sfully imitated. Query, therefore, though I hope I am no &s;tickler for im|morality, whether reviving the&s;e old &s;tories which had been &s;o many years in the mouths of every nur&s;e and midwife, and, I am afraid, of every abbe&s;s and nun throughout the kingdom, might not have been pardoned in favour of the advantage on the &s;ide of literature in gene|ral, and poetry in particular; e&s;pecially as the French, and above all, the ladies, have been ever remarkable, not only for con&s;idering that wit as the mo&s;t palatable, as mo&s;t calculated for the tiercene&s;s and poig|nancy of their language, and that it would be prudery not openly to encourage, which is the mo&s;t highly &s;ea&s;oned with <HI>double entendre.</HI> The fact is, LA FONTAINE was in the &s;ea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, and M. POUJET, his confe&s;&s;or, thought it the intere&s;t of the church that he &s;hould abjure, not what had made the morals of the country wor&s;e than they were before, for heaven knows that would have been at any time a difficult ta&s;k, but what had expo&s;ed the intrigues of re|ligious profe&s;&s;ors.</NOTE>, would

<PB N="58" REF="56">
of acknowledging his incomparable merit in every part of his productions except tho&s;e written for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid of BOURSAULT that his comedies, during the time of MOLIERE, having been the offspring of feuds and controver&s;ies, in which he was always conquered, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;i|derable merit, but were &s;eldom intere&s;ting, becau&s;e they &s;pent their force again&s;t the re&s;i&s;tance oppo&s;ed by this powerful competitor. <HI>Le Medecin Volant, Le Mort Vivant,</HI> and <HI>Les Cadenats,</HI> were of a de&s;|cription too weak to cope with tho&s;e pieces of MO|LIERE, to which they were oppo&s;ed; but, as if the exi&s;tence of that father of comedy had been the enchantment which held the genius of BOURSAULT &s;pell-bound, no &s;ooner did that exi&s;tence cea&s;e, but, like a &s;pirit emancipated from confinement, this au|thor's merit began to be acknowledged; of which truth, as in many other in&s;tances, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me, in con&s;equence of &s;o much matter, which will now pre&s;s on me, to mention more than &s;ome leading particulars.</P>
<P>In 1679, BOURSAULT brought out <HI>Le Mercure Ga|lant,</HI> and <HI>Germanicus,</HI> which la&s;t had before appeared under the title of <HI>La Prince&s;&s;e des Cleves.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e pieces abounded with true comic humour, and the other with harmony, pathos, and &s;trength. VISE,
<PB N="59" REF="57">
the author of a Journal called <HI>Le Mercure Galant,</HI> who was triumphantly ridiculed in this comedy, notwith&s;tanding we have &s;een him formerly join BOURSAULT in ridiculing MOLIERE, complained to the court again&s;t his old friend. The court referred him to the General of the Police, who &s;aid he could not find in his con&s;cience to &s;uppre&s;s the piece, it was &s;o entertaining; but that, to meet the matter half way, he would i&s;&s;ue a behe&s;t to call it <HI>La Co|medie &s;ans Titre,</HI> in order that, if it was not a ju&s;t &s;atire, nobody might find it out.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Germanicus,</HI> it had prodigious &s;ucce&s;s. CORNEILLE in the academy &s;poke of it in the highe&s;t terms, and &s;aid, among other things, that it wanted nothing but the name of RACINE to be con&s;idered as one of the be&s;t tragedies on the the|atre. This RACINE con&s;idered as a &s;arca&s;m, and he, therefore, was never afterwards cordial with COR|NEILLE.</P>
<P><HI>Mari&eacute; Stuart, Phaeton, Meleagre, Mots a la Mode, E&s;ope a la Ville,</HI> and <HI>E&s;ope a la Cour,</HI> make up the re|mainder of BOURSAULT's works, which being writ|ten upon different occa&s;ions, and for different pur|po&s;es, had of cour&s;e various &s;ucce&s;s. The two <HI>Ae&s;ops</HI> are certainly not calculated for intere&s;ting effect, being thronged with fabulous applications;
<PB N="60" REF="58">
the Fables, however, are written with great beauty, point, truth, and intere&s;t; and have ever been held in admiration, though they have been over and over again attempted both here and in other countries with but indifferent effect on the &s;tage.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;ope a la Ville</HI> neverthele&s;s &s;ucceeded greatly during its fir&s;t run; which, indeed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, was owing to the pre&s;ence of mind of the celebrated RAISIN, who performed the part of AESOP. Find|ing that the audience began to tire at this perpetual repetition of fables, though they greatly admired the fables them&s;elves, he came forward and told them that he plainly perceived, among them tokens of di&s;content; but the fact was that the author, de|termined to bring AESOP on the &s;tage, would have failed in portraying the truth of his character if he had made him do any thing but repeat fables.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This character,"</Q>
&s;aid he,

The loude&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al applau&s;e &s;ucceeded, and the piece from that moment was con|&s;idered
<PB N="61" REF="59">
as a work of great genius and a brilliant ornament to the theatre.</P>
<P>Let us look after T. CORNEILLE. <HI>Darius,</HI> brought out in 1655, <HI>Le Geolier de &s;oi-meme,</HI> in 1659, <HI>Le Galant Double</HI> in 1660, and <HI>Stilicon</HI> in the &s;ame year, had none of them more than pa&s;&s;able &s;ucce&s;s; but in 1661, <HI>Camma,</HI> which &s;ubject was &s;ugge&s;ted by FOUQUET, and recommended by the great CORNEILLE to his brother when he returned to the theatre, &s;hews that fortune with T. COR|NEILLE was always in extremes; for the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> where it was repre&s;ented, was &s;o thronged and that repeatedly both in the front and behind the &s;cenes, that there was &s;carcely room for the actors to perform their parts.</P>
<P>The concour&s;e of people who came to this tra|gedy induced the actors, who had exhibited till then only on Sundays, Tue&s;days, and Fridays, to add Thur&s;day to their nights of performance; and this afterwards became a cu&s;tom during the run of any piece that had extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

This is the play that induced BOILEAU to give T. COR|NEILLE the name of the Younger Brother. COR|NEILLE is &s;aid to have written this tragedy in &s;even|teen days.</P>
<P><HI>Achille</HI> in 1673, and <HI>Don Cae&s;ar</HI> D'<HI>Avalos</HI> in 1674, did tolerably well, but this author determined to rou&s;e the public, had recour&s;e in his next piece, <HI>Circe,</HI> which he brought forward in 1675, to ma|chines and decorations. This an&s;wered his expec|tations for the performance ran forty nights in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and was freqently afterwards repeated during the &s;ea&s;on; and CORNEILLE, determined to &s;trike while the iron was hot, in the &s;ame year produced
<PB N="63" REF="61">
<HI>L'Inconnu,</HI> a piece upon the &s;ame principle, which had a prodigious number of repre&s;entations, of which the fir&s;t thirty were at double price.</P>
<P><HI>Le Fe&s;tin de Pierre,</HI> brought out in 1677, was nothing more than MOLIERE's comedy under that title put into ver&s;e, and of cour&s;e rendered more unnatural. <HI>Le Comte D'E&s;&s;ex,</HI> produced in 1678, was performed with &s;ucce&s;s, and has been often re|peated.</P>
<P><HI>La Devin&egrave;re&s;&s;e,</HI> performed in 1679, and <HI>Bra|damante</HI> in 1695, are all that now remain of the dra|matic pieces written by T. CORNEILLE.

<P>This la&s;t was not one of tho&s;e meteors which now and then bur&s;t forth to irradiate the reputation of this author; not that it ought to be taken for granted that his productions of that de&s;cription were his be&s;t;

on the contrary they &s;eem to have owed their fame principally to capriciou&s;ne&s;s, a quality very apt to cheri&s;h what is &s;uperficial and pa&s;s over &s;terling merit.</P>
<P>T. CORNEILLE al&s;o wrote for the theatre two operas under the titles of <HI>P&s;yche,</HI> and <HI>Medee;</HI> nei|ther of which had great &s;ucce&s;s, probably owing to LULLY. Having lo&s;t QUINAULT, the only poet who knew how to give advantage to his mu&s;ic, the cloven foot appeared; for with all his vaunting that his mu&s;ic had made QUINAULT a poet, it fairly proved by his ill &s;ucce&s;s after that writer's retire|ment, that the beauty of QUINAULT's poetry had made LULLY a mu&s;ician.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this account of the works of T. CORNEILLE, becau&s;e they are very frequently confounded with tho&s;e of his bro|ther; an error that ought clearly to be pointed out. There certainly was a wide di&s;tinction between the two men; cau&s;ed by the &s;imple fact that the genius of the elder brother was infinitely &s;uperior to that of the younger, If, however, the works of one may truly be called great, tho&s;e of the other may fairly claim the title of re&s;pectable; and nothing can prove this more fully than his making head in the extraordinary way we have &s;ometimes &s;een at the
<PB N="65" REF="63">
time when his brother's brilliant &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t have been a great ob&s;tacle to his reputation.</P>
<P>Some of the beauties of the great CORNEILLE were &s;trong conception, grandeur of mind, and true delineation of character, T. CORNEILLE could only boa&s;t conduct, regularity, and theatrical effect. Hence the cau&s;e &s;ometimes of &s;udden and unex|pected &s;ucce&s;s. In other re&s;pects his pictures, which were admirable on the &s;ide of de&s;ign, were faint on the &s;ide of colouring. His diction is unequal and weak, and only confirms the facility with which he laboured; always a dangerous circum&s;tance, and that &s;eldom permits an author to attain any thing beyond mediocrity, unle&s;s, through impul&s;ive ge|nius, the mind be in&s;pired with ideas &s;o replete with truth and force, that it may be &s;aid they are rather tran&s;mitted than written.</P>
<P>CAMPISTRON, a writer of re&s;pectable con&s;i|deration, next claims our attention. He was born at TOULOUSE, in 1659, and died of an apoplexy in 1723. CAMPISTRON was a nobleman by birth; and to the happie&s;t di&s;po&s;itions for a pur&s;uit of literature, received a mo&s;t perfect and correct edu|cation. His ta&s;te for poetry led him to PARIS, where RACINE became his guide in his dramatic
<PB N="66" REF="64">
career. CAMPISTRON became the imitator of his preceptor; but, though he equalled him, and &s;ome|times excelled him in the conduct of his pieces, he always fell &s;hort of the beauty of his ver&s;ification.</P>
<P>Owing to his birth, his talent for poetry, and the protection of the Duke de VEND&Ocirc;ME, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal con&s;iderable employments, and was called on to fill a &s;eat in the French Academy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is extremely remarkable, and very proper to be mentioned here, that a &s;ingle trait of private gratitude in CAMPISTRON laid the foundation of the elevated rank and &s;plendid fortune of Cardinal ALBERONI. CAMPISTRON, as he made a tour through ITALY, was wounded, robbed, and &s;tripped near PARMA, in an ob&s;cure village where ALBERONI was curate. The charitable prie&s;t gave CAM|PISTRON an a&s;ylum; fed him, cured him of his wounds, cloathed him, and did what he could to &s;et him forward on his journey. When CAMPISTRON &s;ometime after attended the Duke of VENDOME to the wars in ITALY, he drew his ma&s;ter in&s;en&s;ibly towards the retreat of his pre&s;erver ALBERONI; and, knowing that he could materially &s;erve the Duke by informing him where the country people con|cealed their corn, of which article the army was in great need, he had no doubt but the genero&s;ity of VENDOME would induce him liberally to reward ALBERONI; and thus, by being the in&s;trument of his good fortune, he &s;hould not only have an opportunity, of re&s;|cuing a man of talents from ob&s;curity, but of giving a noble proof of his own gratitude by making &s;uch an ample return for the ho&s;pitality he had formerly received at his hands. The &s;equel every body knows. ALBERONI followed VENDOME to SPAIN, and was there &s;o u&s;eful that he was very &s;oon entru&s;ted with &s;ecrets of &s;tate, and at length be|came fir&s;t mini&s;ter to the king of SPAIN.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="65">In 1683 he brought out his tragedy of <HI>Virginie,</HI> which gave his name the &s;tamp of reputation. He clo&s;ely allied him&s;elf with RAISIN, the actor, at who&s;e hou&s;e he lived in the continual &s;ociety of all the men of talents and genius of that day; &s;o that he had the advantage of their united opinions before he produced any thing to the public.</P>
<P><HI>Arminius</HI> came forward in 1684. At this time the French ta&s;te was guided by the caprice of Ma|dame de BOUILLON, who was con&s;idered as the arbiter of the public judgment, She had taken a whim to patronize a very indifferent tragedy, called <HI>Tel&eacute;phonte,</HI> written by CHAPELLE. In con&s;e|quence of this <HI>Arminius</HI> was thru&s;t into a corner; CAMPISTRON, therefore, withdrew his piece under the idea of improving it, and having made a few im|material alterations, he dedicated it to Madame de BOUILLON, after which time it was univer&s;ally followed.</P>
<P><HI>Andronic</HI> was brought out in the following year, and had &s;uch prodigious &s;ucce&s;s that for the fir&s;t twenty nights the prices of admittance were doubled; and, when after that they had reduced them to their u&s;ual &s;tandard, they were again obliged to double them for a con&s;iderable time; and even then they
<PB N="68" REF="66">
could &s;carcely keep the theatre clear enough to give the actors place for their performance.</P>
<P><HI>Alcibiade,</HI> performed al&s;o in 1685, had not the &s;ucce&s;s of any of tho&s;e pieces which preceded it. CAMPISTRON was accu&s;ed of having borrowed the &s;ubject from the <HI>Themi&s;tocle</HI> of DU RYER, but this was not the truth; or, if it had been &s;o, it was not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the coolne&s;s with which the public received it, for the mo&s;t celebrated authors have at all times taken the &s;ame liberties; and when|ever this has been done to advantage, tho&s;e pro|ductions have been uniformly con&s;idered as an ad|ditional value to the public &s;tock of literature. The real fact was that CAMPISTRON not having had &s;ufficient time to prepare his play, it came out in a more unfini&s;hed &s;tate than any of tho&s;e the public had before &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Phraate</HI> produced in 1686, was &s;o bold a picture of the times that CAMPISTRON rou&s;ed all PARIS again&s;t him. It was performed but three times, and afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te le&s;t the incen&s;ed party &s;hould have had influence enough to &s;end the author to the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P><HI>Phocion</HI> performed in 1688, had very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. The public had not forgot <HI>Phraate.</HI> This
<PB N="69" REF="67">
induced CAMPISTRON to turn his mind to a &s;ubject which he thought would conciliate all parties. He, therefore, in 1690, brought forward <HI>Adrien,</HI> taken from the Hi&s;tory of the Church; but the public, as little de&s;irous of &s;eeing religion on the &s;tage as po|lities, gave this chri&s;tian tragedy, as it was called, a very heretical reception.</P>
<P>CAMPISTRON, however, was determined to &s;tick to &s;cripture; and, therefore, in his tragedy of <HI>Tiri|date,</HI> which was exhibited in 1691, the very delicate &s;ubject, from the Second Book of SAMUEL, of the amour of AMNON and his &s;i&s;ter TAMER, was intro|duced on the theatre, under the veil of profane hi&s;tory. This tragedy had but little &s;ucce&s;s; and, though it has been at different times revived, its reception was always &s;o little in its favour, that it would have been better for the author and the pub|lic if it had been at once con&s;igned to oblivion.</P>
<P><HI>Actius,</HI> brought out in 1693, is &s;o little known, and its &s;ate &s;o little remembered, that a French author &s;ays it is entirely lo&s;t to the world except the following line:
<Q><L>" Ce grand ACTIUS, fous qui l'univers tremble."</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Pompeia.</HI> This tragedy was publi&s;hed in the works of CAMPISTRON, but its original &s;ucce&s;s is

not known. His comedies will come more pro|perly hereafter; we have, therefore, nothing now to prevent our leaving the cour&s;e fairly open to RA|CINE, expect the nece&s;&s;ity of noticing PRADON, who was the &s;ame &s;ort of thorn in RACINE's &s;ide that BOURSAULT had been in the &s;ide of MOLIERE; with very di&s;tinct and different preten&s;ions, however, BOURSAULT having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great genius, and every literary requi&s;ite, except a cla&s;&s;ical education, and PRADON having boa&s;ted very little from nature without any education at all<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prince de CONTI meeting PRADON after the fir&s;t repre|&s;entation of his tragedy of <HI>Tamerlaine,</HI>

The con&s;equence was, that he drew on his head all the vengeance of RACINE's admirers, and particularly that of
<PB N="71" REF="69">

her brother, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The con&s;equence was that RACINE's play had but very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s, and that of PRADON was lifted to the &s;kies.</P>
<P>Every indu&s;try was u&s;ed to humiliate RACINE and exalt PRADON. The boxes, to PRADON's play, were taken for &s;everal nights together; &s;o were tho&s;e to the play of RACINE, and paid; but they were locked up and left empty, that the hou&s;e might appear as if it were de&s;erted. At the &s;ame time parties were hired to line the two <HI>parterres</HI> and to applaud one play and hi&s;s the other. But the mo&s;t curious in&s;tance of their caprice was, that RACINE was execrated for bringing out a piece upon &s;o indecent a &s;ubject, when the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, equally reprehen&s;ible in PRADON, was, in his favour, not only pa&s;&s;ed by but commended. It was &s;aid that to rai&s;e this cabal it co&s;t this illu&s;trious party fifteen thou&s;and livres.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s at la&s;t became very &s;erious. Ma|dame DESHOULIERES wrote a &s;onnet with a view to humiliate RACINE and BOILLAU. They &s;u&s;|pecting this &s;onnet to have come from the pen of the Duke of NEVERS, an&s;wered it by another, con|&s;erving the &s;ame rhimes, in which they treated the Duke with great &s;everity. He replied by a third,
<PB N="73" REF="71">
&s;till keeping the &s;ame rhimes, and fini&s;hed by a de|claration that he would cane them both in the the|atre before the public. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However the protection of PRADON might be unworthy the il|lu&s;trious cabal who lent him their countenance, and in particular Ma|dame DESHOULIERES, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled that RACINE drew it all on his head by the envious, the unworthy, the bitter, the indecent critici&s;ms which he threw out him&s;elf, and encouraged in his par|tizans, again&s;t the venerable CORNEILLE. Madame de BOUILLON and her party, however wrong their means of revenge, meant only to &s;upport the cau&s;e of that great writer again&s;t all the coxcombs in literature, who at that time &s;ought every occa&s;ion in their power to humiliate him; at the head of which very re&s;pectable &s;et, RACINE ought to have been a&s;hamed of placing him&s;elf. In protecting PRA|DON they avenged the author of <HI>Cinna</HI>; and it cannot be denied but employing one dunce in a good cau&s;e, was a thou&s;and times more worthy in them than it was in RACINE to countenance twenty dunces in the &s;upport of a bad one.</NOTE></P>
<P>This, however, upon reflection he thought pro|per to decline; for, his cau&s;e not being a very good one, and RACINE and BOILEAU having been that year cho&s;en by the king to write the hi&s;tory of his reign, he was apprehen&s;ive by this vindictive &s;pirit he might incur the king's di&s;plea&s;ure; which con|jecture turned out to be well &s;ounded, for the king having noticed this unhand&s;ome treatment to RA|CINE from fir&s;t to la&s;t, &s;ent for the Duke him&s;elf and repre&s;ented to him that he not only injured the

<PB N="74" REF="72">
cau&s;e of literature, an object of con&s;equence in all civilized &s;tates, by protecting dunces to the prejudice of men of talents, but that in this particular in&s;tance he had in&s;ulted two men of merit, whom he him&s;elf had taken under his royal protection, and to whom it was his re&s;olution to &s;hew every po&s;&s;ible counte|nance and attention.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this ample ju&s;tice done to the reputation of RACINE, the humiliation of having &s;o de&s;picable a competitor as PRADON, and that it &s;hould be po&s;&s;ible that the public could he&s;itate a moment between their different merits, determined RACINE, at all times exce&s;&s;ively vain, and feelingly irritable, in&s;tead of exulting in his triumph, and treating the whole bu&s;ine&s;s with the ineffable con|tempt it de&s;erved, to retire at once from the theatre. In vain did BOILEAU, that kind friend, who&s;e malignant &s;pirit had led RACINE into all &s;orts of &s;crapes, entreat him, in his &s;eventh epi&s;tle, to re|enter on his dramatic career. He per&s;i&s;ted &s;tub|bornly till twelve years afterwards, when he brought out <HI>E&s;ther</HI> from motives of piety.</P>
<P>Madame de MAINTENON, di&s;gu&s;ted with the pieces which were performed by her young &s;cholars at her convent of St. CYR, prevailed, with &s;ome difficulty, on RACINE to undertake &s;ome religious
<PB N="75" REF="73">
&s;ubject to be repre&s;ented by the&s;e young ladies. RACINE, after rai&s;ing many difficulties, con&s;ented at la&s;t, and wrote the tragedy of <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> which was performed, during the Carnaval at St. CYR, and afterwards at VERSAILLES before the king.</P>
<P>Madame de SEVIGNE calls this RACINE's <HI>chef d'oeuvre.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This poet,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"has here &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. He loves his GOD as he loved his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. He is as warm on holy &s;ubjects as he was on profane. All is beautiful, grand, written with dignity."</Q>
VOLTAIRE, however, does not happen to be of this opinion.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It &s;eems to be,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"very extraordinary that <HI>E&s;ther</HI> had univer&s;al &s;ucce&s;s, and that <HI>Athalie,</HI> though performed but two years afterwards, by the &s;ame per&s;ons, had none at all. The ca&s;e was entirely the rever&s;e when the&s;e pieces were performed at PARIS long after the author's death, and when prejudice and partiality had al&s;o died away. <HI>Athalie</HI> was repre&s;ented then, as it ought to be, with tran&s;port; and <HI>E&s;ther</HI> was received with coldne&s;s, and &s;oon forgotten. The fact was; that, at this latter period, there were no &s;ervile courtiers who complai&s;antly acknowledged <HI>E&s;ther</HI> in Madame de MAINTENON, or malignantly &s;aw <HI>Va&s;hti</HI> in Madame de MONTESPAN, or <HI>Hamon</HI> in DE LOUVOIS; or, above all, the per&s;ecution

VOLTAIRE's leave, a &s;triking picture of the pro&s;cription and per|&s;ecution of the Huguenots.</NOTE>, and who afterwards hanged his fa|vourite with as little rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P><HI>E&s;ther</HI> again rou&s;ed RACINE's enemies; who&s;e malignity, in revenge for the &s;atire thrown out again&s;t them by BOILEAU, was &s;o inde&s;atigably exerci&s;ed, that from a variety of repre&s;entations of the circum&s;tance to Madame de MAINTENON, &s;he was taught to believe that &s;he relaxed the morals of her young pen&s;ioners by &s;uffering them to ex|hibit any thing dramatic, even though on religious &s;ubjects. De&s;irious, however, to hear <HI>Athalie,</HI> e&s;|pecially after RACINE had taken &s;o much pains to plea&s;e her, &s;he con&s;ented that the young ladies &s;hould repeat the play in the pre&s;ence of the king in a plain antichamber, and without theatrical dre&s;&s;es. A piece, thus deprived of the advantages of dre&s;&s;es, &s;cenery, and decorations, and upon &s;uch a &s;erious
<PB N="77" REF="75">
&s;ubject, could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed to any extra|ordinary degree; which circum&s;tance, perhaps, e&s;caped VOLTAIRE. The king, however, was &s;o well content that he conferred on RACINE the charge of one of his gentlemen in ordinary.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now go as &s;hortly as po&s;&s;ible into an ex|amination of RACINE, of whom more, perhaps, has been &s;aid by the French than of any other poet that ever had exi&s;tence, and certainly more, infinitely more, than his merit will bear out.</P>
<P>VOLTAIRE, who know as well that he was unable to write ver&s;e with the &s;ame tenderne&s;s, the &s;ame beauty, and the &s;ame harmony as RACINE, as he did that in eloquence, force, and animation, he could greatly excel him, ri&s;ked nothing in tho&s;e rap|turous declarations which the world have taken for hone&s;t candour, and &s;elf denying impartiality. The&s;e are his words, on the delineation of RACINE's cha|racter of <HI>Phedre.</HI> <Q REND="inline">"This,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is the <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of the human mind, and the eternal but inimitable model for the labours of all tho&s;e who would write ver&s;e."</Q>
This, in Mr. VOLTAIRE's opinion, &s;eems to &s;tamp RACINE as the fir&s;t of poets; but does it &s;tamp him as the fir&s;t of dramatic writers? At another time, when he was &s;peaking with great enthu&s;ia&s;m of the poetry of RACINE, he
<PB N="78" REF="76">
was a&s;ked by a friend why he had not given the world the eulogium of that poet as well as of the great CORNEILLE. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is already done,"</Q> &s;aid VOLTAIRE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we have nothing to do but to write under every page, fine, pathetic, harmonious, &s;ublime!"</Q></P>
<P>Why did not VOLTAIRE add touching, cha|racteri&s;tic, important, philo&s;ophic? Becau&s;e the&s;e are always to be found in CORNEILLE, often in VOLTAIRE, and &s;eldom in RACINE.</P>
<P>The ba&s;is of enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration has &s;eldom much &s;olidity. The harmony of numbers, the en|chantment of language, a happy preci&s;ion, a fini&s;hed elocution; all the&s;e captivate and entrance the mind; but when we are told by reflection, or if we are too far gone to reflect, by a candid and fini&s;hed critic, that all the&s;e qualities are no more than a fe|licitous variation of the idiom of a particular tongue, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to confe&s;s that, in all this &s;uperfi|cial deception, &s;implicity, nature, and the heart have been egregiou&s;ly outraged; and, if this is not the ca&s;e, how comes it that RACINE has never been tran&s;lated? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e it would take a poet, ay, and a great poet, to tran&s;late RACINE; whereas a common lingui&s;t might tran&s;late SHAKESPEAR, or even CORNEILLE, into any of the living languages.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="77">What does all this &s;ay, but that, &s;educed by this inimitable elegance, we &s;hut our eyes to faults much more material and important than the beauties we have been able to di&s;cover. There is a wide di&s;|tinction between a great poet and a great author; between RACINE, for in&s;tance, and CORNEILLE. Where is there in RACINE the painting, the variety, the depth, the grandeur, the elevation, the force, the maje&s;ty that pervade the writings of CORNEILLE? The&s;e are not to be found in &s;tudy, and unfortu|nately RACINE had no other communication with the Mu&s;es. I own that CORNEILLE fails in &s;tyle and ta&s;te; but &s;tyle and ta&s;te are weak and effemi|nate literary requi&s;ites. How &s;uch &s;uperficial ex|pre&s;&s;ions fade away at tho&s;e more &s;ub&s;tantial epithets, truth, and nature. I own the writing of COR|NEILLE is &s;ometimes hard, incorrect, perplexed, and rude; but I &s;trip off this rind and in&s;tantly flows a nouri&s;hing juice that warms my heart and cheers and exhilerates my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The fact is that we find in CORNEILLE a mo|rali&s;t, a philo&s;opher, a legi&s;lator, and yet a poet. Love, pity, pride, ambition, cruelty, remor&s;e, re|pentance, mercy, clemency, are only &s;o many &s;hades which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a thou&s;and intermediate tints, he colours the picture of human nature. RA|CINE, only a poet, depicts nothing but love in all its various vici&s;&s;itudes. To love all the other
<PB N="80" REF="78">
pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ub&s;ervient; and, as if this were not enough, his Cupid is now and then a <HI>petit maitre</HI> and apes all the manners of the French court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CORNEILLE &s;aid to SEGRAIS, who &s;at near him on the fir&s;t re|pre&s;entation of <HI>Bajazet,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the per&s;onages of this tragedy wear Turki&s;h habits but they utter French &s;entiments. I &s;hall, how|ever, &s;ay this only to you, otherwi&s;e it will be taken for jealou&s;y, which I as much di&s;dain as I love to commend the beautiful poetry of RACINE."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whenever CORNEILLE has availed him&s;elf of hi&s;tory, he has taken the circum&s;tances and invented appropriate language for his per&s;onages. If RA|CINE wrote <HI>Phedre, Britannicus,</HI> and <HI>Athalie,</HI> he contented him&s;elf with ver&s;ifying EURIPIDES, TA|CITUS, and the Scriptures. But the great fault of RA|CINE, and that which &s;hews he was by no means a ma&s;ter of dramatic con&s;truction, is his having given to love the fir&s;t rank in his tragedies; whereas reli|gion, general honour, patrioti&s;m, and other important public duties, though confirmed, conciliated, and endeared by love, to render the con&s;truction of a play grand and intere&s;ting, ought always to be the primary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The very eulogi&s;ts of RACINE lo&s;e them&s;elves in attempting to draw a compari&s;on between him and CORNEILLE, They tell you that CORNEILLE
<PB N="81" REF="79">
is like a &s;tatue that &s;trikes you by the grandeur, the pride, the force, and the vigour of its form; that RACINE is a picture, &s;weet, tender, delicate, na|tural, and animated, which through the eyes touches the heart. CORNEILLE a torrent that ri&s;es up with violence and precipitates it&s;elf with impetuo&s;ity; RACINE a maje&s;tic river who&s;e grand and peaceable cour&s;e conveys delight and expands fertility. COR|NEILLE an audacious eagle that lo&s;es it&s;elf in the clouds and &s;eizes the thunder of JUPITER; RA|CINE a tender dove that &s;ails beautifully through the air to the groves of IDALIA, from whence it returns training the car of VENUS.</P>
<P>That firmne&s;s of mind, that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ex|cellence, that certainty of &s;uperiority nece&s;&s;ary to form a great author, upon all occa&s;ions failed RA|CINE. He flew, but he did not &s;oar; he always plea&s;ed the ear, but he &s;eldom reached the heart; he every where delighted the imagination, but no where touched the &s;oul. That which cheated you into an idea of perfection often flattened into dull monotony, and fancied &s;ublimity, perpetually dwindled into mea&s;ured numbers.</P>
<P>This mental weakne&s;s was manife&s;t in all his conduct as a man. He was not contented with
<PB N="82" REF="80">
fancying him&s;elf the greate&s;t writer that ever had exi&s;ted, but he fancied he knew every thing better than every body. When he found him&s;elf &s;o greatly favoured by Madame de MAINTENON, who, by the way, had only encouraged his mu&s;e to humiliate her rival Madame MONTESPAN, he actualty projected a plan of finance, which he thought would work a complete reformation in the legi&s;lature. This plan was put on paper and confided to his patrone&s;s, in who&s;e hands LOUIS the fourteenth found it; who not only &s;oundly rated the lady for her officiou&s;ne&s;s, but warmly inveighed again&s;t the temerity of the poet. <Q REND="inline">"How,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"becau&s;e this man can write harmonious ver&s;e, does he think he knows every thing? and becau&s;e he is a good poet does he fancy him&s;elf a great mini&s;ter?"</Q></P>
<P>It was the great misfortune of RACINE that he con&s;idered the perfection of ver&s;ifying the perfection of writing; to which BOILEAU, who &s;eemed like one of tho&s;e evil genui&s;es that under the ma&s;k of kindne&s;s lure men to a precipice and then laugh at them as they are precipitated down, did not a little contribute. Thus when he thought he had immor|talized him&s;elf by any work which the public re|ceived coldly, the &s;hock was too much for his &s;pirits. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Though I own,"</Q> &s;aid he to BOILEAU,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"nothing delights me &s;o much as public applau&s;e, the lea&s;t,
<PB N="83" REF="81">
the mo&s;t contemptible critici&s;m, always gives me more pain than the warme&s;t prai&s;e ever gave me plea&s;ure."</Q>
Is this a great man, a &s;ublime ge|nuis!</P>
<P>Many traits in the life of RACINE, his epigrams, and above all, his preface to <HI>Britannicus,</HI> where with a heart &s;welling and a mind &s;tung with envy, he endeavoured with the mo&s;t bitter irony to turn the greate&s;t part of CORNEILLE's pieces into ridicule, di&s;cover in RACINE that pityful littlene&s;s of mind, that cau&s;tic and ira&s;cible &s;pirit which HORACE at|tributes to all poets, whom he plea&s;antly calls the choleric race.</P>
<P>This perpetual di&s;content and eternal irritability abridged his life. After the bu&s;ine&s;s of his im|proving the finance, Madame de MAINTENON gave him to under&s;tand that the king was &s;o little &s;atisfied with him that he had better not appear at court till the &s;torm was blown over; determined, however, to be convinced, he appeared before the king, who took no notice of him. This &s;evere humiliation he could not brook; he, therefore, retired to his native country, where he is &s;aid to have lingered a twelve-month in a mo&s;t, di&s;tracted &s;tate of mind, and then to have died on the twenty-fir&s;t of April, in 1699, of a broken heart.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="82">Faithful to the immutable dictates of &s;acred truth, let us not withhold a fair tribute of prai&s;e to RACINE. As a poet he has been unfortunately &s;poken of to the exclu&s;ion of all others. If his friends had not been &s;o warm in his prai&s;e, his works would not have demanded &s;o critical an inve&s;tigation, and he would have been accorded his own fair legiti|mate portion of commendation, without the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;hewing by compari&s;on how inferior he was to tho&s;e he is &s;aid to have excelled.</P>
<P>In its general &s;en&s;e, RACINE certainly did not belong to the fir&s;t cla&s;s of writers, which mu&s;t be indi&s;pen&s;ibly compo&s;ed of men of original genius; nor did he more in its particular &s;en&s;e; the art he exerci&s;ed being of a &s;econdary nature.</P>
<P>The cla&s;&s;es of writers, particularly con&s;idered, may be divided into a large number; at the head of which &s;tands fir&s;t, the epic, &s;econd, the dramatic, and &s;oon after the lyric poet; but any number of any one of the&s;e particular cla&s;&s;es may belong to the fir&s;t cla&s;s of writers, taken generally, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of original genius<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be my bu&s;ine&s;s hereafter to enlarge upon this.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus RACINE, having neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed original
<PB N="85" REF="83">
genius, nor written epic poetry, cannot generally, nor particularly, be cla&s;&s;ed otherwi&s;e than as a &s;e|condary writer. His labours, however, are both ingenious, and meritorious; and will en&s;ure him a large portion of fame with all tho&s;e who con&s;ider ta&s;te and &s;tyle as the &s;tandard of literature; but, I believe, they are few writers who would not rather, like CORNEILLE, be e&s;teemed by the wi&s;e, admired by the judicious, and emulated by men of genius; than, like RACINE, be the criterion of the fa&s;hion|able, the wonder of the inexperienced, and the idol of the ladies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. DANCOURT, AND OTHER AUTHORS TO CREBILLON.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING principally &s;poken of tragedy in the la&s;t chapter, in order that RACINE might be more pro|perly before the reader, I &s;hall now return to the time when DANCOURT gave a new turn to comedy; certainly an imitation of MOLIERE, but beyond all que&s;tion, as far as it went, in every re&s;pect an im|provement; for, by aiming at le&s;s of the ARISTO|PHANES, his &s;atire is more general and le&s;s of|fen&s;ive.</P>
<P>DANCOURT was born at FONTAINBLEAU, in 1661, he was educated under Father DE LA RUE, a Je&s;uit; who finding him a young man of excellent under&s;tanding, did all in his power to retain him as a member of that fraternity. He, however, de|clared for the bar; but, finding that &s;tudy too &s;traitened and dry for the vivacity and penetration of a genius like his, he finally determined for the
<PB N="87" REF="85">
&s;tage, where he made &s;o great a progre&s;s, that like MOLIERE, he became director of the theatre.</P>
<P>Though DANCOURT brought out no le&s;s than fifty-two pieces, be&s;ides &s;ix or eight others attributed to him, his &s;ubjects lie in a &s;mall circle, round, which he perpetually turned. Trick&s;ters of every de&s;cription he had a mo&s;t happy knack of expo&s;ing; and, to employ this talent, he found an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of materials in painting the manners of middling life, and the cunning of tho&s;e who are kind friends and good neighbours, except upon tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ions when intere&s;t renders them callous to ge|nero&s;ity and in&s;en&s;ible to good fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>The&s;e ordinary feelings and actions of mankind which pervade every order of &s;ociety, he mo&s;t happily pur&s;ued even to the lowe&s;t pea&s;ants. If his &s;cene was a village, or even a mill, the &s;ubtilty, with which intere&s;t teaches men to betray tho&s;e they appear to love, was no le&s;s refined than if his cha|racters had been financiers, or procureurs; and, in|deed, in painting ru&s;tic manners no man ever was &s;o happy. His clowns are &s;o &s;imple, and &s;o natural, yet &s;o fine and &s;o cunning, and manage their intrigues with &s;uch keen dexterity, that in intere&s;t, a &s;tate&s;man might envy the art and adroitne&s;s of BLAISE, and
<PB N="88" REF="86">
in love a woman of fa&s;hion might be proud to emu|late the coquettry and capriciou&s;ne&s;s of BABET.</P>
<P>The lighte&s;t circum&s;tance furni&s;hed him with an idea for an entertainment. An adventure, a fa&s;hion, a proverb, became a &s;ubject of moment, dramati&s;ed by DANCOURT. His pieces are all light, but they are ingenious, regular, managed adroitly, and with|out embarra&s;&s;ment. His dialogue is natural, lively, rapid, full of gaiety, and &s;parkling with wit; written, five plays excepted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Three of the&s;e pieces are <HI>Le Trabi&s;on Puni, Madame Artus,</HI> and <HI>Sancho Panco Gouverneur.</HI> The fir&s;t, which is from the Spani&s;h, was afterwards &s;ucce&s;sfully brought forward by LE SAGE, in pro&s;e. The &s;econd was a bad imitation of <HI>Le Tartuffe</HI>; and <HI>Sanco</HI> had no effect till it was, in 1762, reduced into one act by POINSINIT, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the mu&s;ic of PHILIDOR. The other two, <HI>Caphale et Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">is,</HI> and <HI>La Metemp&s;ico&s;e,</HI> are certainly inferior to all the re&s;t of his works.</NOTE>, which are by no means the be&s;t of his works, in pro&s;e, a &s;trong proof of his good &s;en&s;e. Not that he was unequal to the ta&s;k of writing poetry; for his pieces are &s;ometimes in|ter&s;per&s;ed with little &s;ongs, ma&s;ques, and diverti&s;e|ments, which are written very neatly, and which, upon the whole, rank his genius &s;omewhere be|tween PRIOR and VANBRUGH; which la&s;t, what|ever his obligations were to nature, was, as I &s;hall hereafter particularize, al&s;o highly obliged to DAN|COURT.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="87">The pieces of DANCOURT which have be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation, are <HI>La Femme D'intrigue, Le Chevalier a la Mode, Les Bourgeoi&s;es a la Mode,</HI> and the <HI>Agioteurs.</HI> The&s;e, except the la&s;t, are pieces of five acts, and for conduct, truth, colour|ing and &s;pirit, no comedies can be better managed, nor characters drawn.

<P>It has been &s;aid that what REGNARD was to MOLIERE in the higher &s;tyle of comedy, DAN|COURT was to the &s;ame degree in farce. Nothing can more clearly prove his good &s;en&s;e than this re|mark, for that part of MOLIERE's works which ap|proaches neare&s;t to farce, is by infinite degrees his be&s;t; and it would have ill &s;uited the bent of DAN|COURT's genuis to have attempted any thing of a grander kind. As it is, by diver&s;ifying, extending, and, indeed, improving this lighter &s;pecies of dra|matic amu&s;ement, his pieces have ever been de|&s;ervedly celebrated; had he attempted any thing more he might have been re&s;pectable, but he never would have been popular.</P>
<P>It has been laid to DANCOURT's charge, that he foi&s;ted on the public the works of other people as his own; but the &s;ame thing has been &s;aid of every author of merit that ever exi&s;ted. In &s;upport
<PB N="100" REF="90">
of the&s;e accu&s;ations again&s;t DANCOURT it is in|&s;i&s;ted that, being a manager of a theatre, and con|&s;tantly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a variety of new pieces, he appropriated &s;uch as he thought proper to his own u&s;e, and having kept copies of them, returned them to their different authors as improper for repre|&s;entation.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;ertion, however, &s;tands upon very feeble ground indeed, and &s;eems to have originated from that envy which, the poet tells us, pur&s;ues merit as its &s;hadow. There is no piece of DANCOURT, let the materials be ever &s;o &s;light, that is not touched with the hand of a ma&s;ter. How could he then reap advantage from the e&s;&s;ays of novices? For he is not accu&s;ed of robbing a &s;ingle adept. Indeed the be&s;t name they can produce, and almo&s;t the only one, to corroborate this improbable a&s;&s;ertion, is that of SAINTYON, who is &s;u&s;pected to be the author of <HI>Le Chevalier a la Mode,</HI> and <HI>Les Bour|ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;is a la Mode</HI>&mdash;two comedies of con&s;iderable merit in point of con&s;truction the latter being al|mo&s;t, word for word, our admirable play of <HI>The Confederacy</HI>&mdash;and known to be the author of <HI>Les Facons du Temps,</HI> and <HI>Danae,</HI> two pieces which, though touched up by RICCOBONI and DOMINIQUE, and pu&s;&s;ed by BOURSAULT's celebrated VISE, who

<P>Tho&s;e who can read with judgement will very ea&s;ily &s;ee that the works of DANCOURT are uni|formly written by the &s;ame per&s;on. They are col|lected into nine volumes with the greate&s;t care by his friends, who one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e would have made the&s;e di&s;tinctions had they been nece&s;&s;ary; and they bear the &s;ignature of DE LA MOTTE, who&s;e duty it was to &s;ign the privilege of the king, and who&s;e advice, both for the &s;ake of truth and out of care for the reputation of DANCOURT, whom he admired, would of cour&s;e have been to pub|li&s;h no more than was legitimately his. I &s;hall hereafter re&s;ume DANCOURT as an actor and a manager.</P>
<P>REGNARD, a re&s;pectable writer, who is &s;aid to have divided the genuis of MOLIERE with DAN|COURT, certainly not only cho&s;e the wor&s;t and the mo&s;t difficult part, but that to which he was un|equal. The higher &s;tyle of MOLIERE's comedy is in ver&s;e, and unfortunately for REGNARD in &s;uch ver&s;e as he was incapable of writing. He did right, however, for had he cho&s;en that part which DAN|COURT improved, he would have been wor&s;e off. VOLTAIRE, who loves to afford left handed prai&s;e,
<PB N="102" REF="92">
&s;ays that he who is not plea&s;ed with REGNARD is not worthy to admire MOLIERE. The truth is, that had REGNARD never heard of &s;uch a writer as MOLIERE, he would have been a better writer him|&s;elf. Every man &s;hould u&s;e his own faculties &s;uch as they are, and &s;corn the &s;ervility of imitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I call imitation &s;ervility, I mean that imitation by which a writer conde&s;cends to ape a man's &s;tyle and manner; &s;uch was REGNARD's imitation of MOLIERE. That broad principal upon which DANCOURT imitated MOLIERE is a very different thing, for DANCOURT had nothing of MOLIERE in his &s;tyle but its general vi|vacity and brilliancy, dre&s;&s;ed in expre&s;&s;ions of his own. Be&s;ides the cha|racteri&s;tic of this imitation was that cha&s;te repre&s;entation of mind and manners, which MOLIERE imitated from the ancients, and the ancients from nature.

<P>REGNARD, who was born of rich parents in 1657, in the early part of his life vi&s;ited many of the courts of EUROPE. In one of his voyages in the MEDITERANEAN, he was taken by a Cor&s;air and &s;old afterwards for fifteen hundred livres. His ma&s;ter carried him to CONSTANTINOPLE, where he was a long time a &s;lave; finding means, however, to inform his friends of his &s;ituation, they paid his ran&s;om, and he returned to FRANCE, bringing with him his chains; which, in imitation of AESOP, and other
<PB N="103" REF="93">
great men, he pre&s;erved to remind him of his former adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>REGNARD, between 1688 and 1695, brought out &s;ix pieces at the ancient Italian theatre<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be nece&s;&s;ary once more to remind the reader that, before the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Italian theatre in 1716, at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> a company of Italians performed <HI>au petit Bourbon</HI> al|ternately with MOLIERE, and continued there, after he had removed to the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> till 1697, when the theatre was pull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d down to build the entrance to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> and the Italians were entirely di&s;|per&s;ed; though they might, it is &s;aid, have rall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed again but for a very &s;ingular circum&s;tance.

This his enemies in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">ou&s;ly repre&s;ented to his di&s;advantage, and his di&s;grace followed of cour&s;e.</NOTE>. The&s;e were none of tho&s;e in which he copied MOLIERE, but if they had been any of them they would have done him but little credit, for they were flunzy enough, and their &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o little to the repu|tation of their author, or DOMINIQUE, who pro|duced them, that there is an anecdote of his era&s;ing &s;ome of them from his &s;tock catalogue.</P>
<P>His pieces for the French theatre, amounting to eight, have more preten&s;ions to merit, particu|larly <HI>Le Joueur de Bal, Le Di&s;trait, Democrite,</HI> and <HI>Les Menechmes;</HI> but even the&s;e are full of de|fects;
<PB N="104" REF="94">
having but little original in them, and being written in dull monotonous ver&s;e, with little energy and le&s;s intere&s;t. The <HI>Di&s;trait</HI> makes a better figure in BRUYERE, <HI>Democrite</HI> is a &s;trange jumble of improbability, and <HI>Les Menechmes,</HI> originally from PLAUTUS, is altered very little for the better from ROTROU. Upon the whole <HI>Le Joueur</HI> is his be&s;t comedy, which has intere&s;t, &s;ituation, and character enough to give it con&s;equence, were it not for the negligent, heavy, and pro&s;aic ver&s;e in which it is written.</P>
<P>DUFRESNY was an author of con&s;iderable merit. His pieces, upwards of thirty in number, are ge|nerally an irregular jumble, carele&s;s, and negligent, and yet they are not without ingenuity, &s;prightline&s;s, and nature. Their grand fault is indecency, which, however, in FRANCE, has &s;eldom impeded the &s;uc|ce&s;s of dramatic repre&s;entations of the ligher kind, nay, &s;ome of tho&s;e which have been performed on the <HI>Boulevards,</HI> have, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, no other merit.</P>
<P>It is very well known that DUFRESNY was de|&s;cended from HENRY the fourth. That king hav|ing had an amour with a woman who was called LA BELLE JARDINIERE, the con&s;equence of which was the birth of DUFRESNY's grandfather. LOUIS

fourteenth did not di&s;&s;emble the fact; but, on that account, afforded him his particular countenance and protection.</P>
<P>It is a&s;toni&s;hing how variou&s;ly gifted this man was, and yet how little he knew. He had a ta&s;te for poetry, painting, &s;culpture, architecture, and agriculture; but his great delight was mu&s;ic; and, though nothing could beat into him the &s;malle&s;t comprehen&s;ion of its theoretical principles, yet he made many melodies, which are printed at the end of his works, and which evince a mu&s;ical mind if he had known how to have put it into action. His method was when he had invented his tune to &s;ing it to GRANDVAL, who as well as an actor was a mu&s;ician, after which GRANDVAL wrote it down and added the accompanyments.</P>
<P>As extraordinary things are &s;aid of his know|ledge of de&s;ign; in which he u&s;ed no pencil, nor crayon, but a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, fa&s;hioning every kind of animate and inanimate object with the mo&s;t cri|tical &s;ymetry and ta&s;te. Models for &s;culpture he formed in the &s;ame extemporaneous manner with clay and wax; and his knowledge of agriculture, which he is very gravely &s;aid to have inherited from

<P>The gardens of MIGNAUX, near POISSY, tho&s;e in the FAUXBOURG, SAINT ANTOINE, called <HI>Du Moulin</HI> and <HI>Le Chemin Creux,</HI> tho&s;e of the Abbe PAJOT, near DE VINCENNES, are proofs of his &s;uperior ta&s;te and judgement in this &s;tudy. LOUIS the fourteenth, determined to make the gardens at VERSAILLES &s;urpa&s;s in grandeur and magnificence every thing of that kind &s;een before, &s;ubmitted his plan to DUFRESNY, who &s;ugge&s;ted many material alterations with which the king was greatly plea&s;ed; but objected to them on account of the prodigious expence that would be incurred had the plan been carried into execution. He, however, to &s;hew DU|FRESNY how much he admired his &s;pirit and ta&s;te, made him controller of his gardens.</P>
<P>This projector afterwards was at the head of a gla&s;s manufactory which had prodigious &s;ucce&s;s. With all the&s;e fortunate advantages, however, DU|FRESNY was always behind hand. This induced him, when he had brought this manufactory to perfection, to &s;ell his concern in it for a very moderate &s;um, which circum&s;tance coming to the ears of the king, he obliged tho&s;e who had taken advantage of his

nece&s;&s;ity and ingenuity to allow him three thou&s;and livres a year. His extravagance, however, knew no bounds, and it was not long before he agreed with his partners to give up the annuity for a given &s;um, on which the king was heard to &s;ay,

It is not &s;o much the number of pieces, or their e&s;timation, in point of weight and con&s;equence, that entitles the performances of POISSON to particular mention here, as the &s;implicity and nature in their &s;tyle by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>His per&s;onages are, like tho&s;e of DANCOURT, cho&s;en from the middle order of &s;ociety, who&s;e tone and language he has happily caught; and, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that his pieces are fee|ble, on the &s;ide of invention, they are de&s;igned with that intelligence, and executed with that fa|cility, which evince judgement and experience in their author.</P>
<P>He is con&s;idered as the inventor of the character of CRISPIN, and the&s;e pieces are evidently written to &s;upport that character, which he always per|formed him&s;elf.

<P>LE NOBLE was born at TROYES, in 1643, of a family of di&s;tinction, and was given, entirely through his merit, a charge of procureur general of the
<PB N="110" REF="102">
parliament of METZ.

He ap|pealed again&s;t the &s;entence, merely to gain time, and in the mean while he was committed to the <HI>Con&ccedil;ergerie.</HI></P>
<P>GABRIELLE PERREAU, known by the name of LA BELLE EPICIERE, was at that time in the &s;ame pri&s;on, where &s;he had been &s;ent by her hu&s;band for infidelity and other ill conduct. She was hand|&s;ome, and LE NOBLE, not in&s;en&s;ible of her charms, undertook to be her advocate. She in return was not ungrateful. A hand&s;ome man, with a lively and &s;en&s;ible imagination, and who &s;poke and wrote to admiration, was the very object to her mind. They lived together upon the mo&s;t familiar terms till an apprehen&s;ion of a living witne&s;s of their inter|cour&s;e obliged them to take mea&s;ures to prevent a di&s;covery.</P>
<P>LE NOBLE bad prolonged the proceedings with great addre&s;s both again&s;t her and him&s;elf; and, upon this emergency, he managed that &s;he &s;hould be received into a convent to lie in as a pen&s;ioner. In this &s;ituation he concerted his mea&s;ures &s;o cun|ningly
<PB N="111" REF="103">
that when &s;he was able to go out, he evaded the vigilence of his keepers and retired to an ob&s;cure part of PARIS, where &s;he &s;oon joined him, fir&s;t leav|ing the child behind her as a pre&s;ent to the holy &s;i&s;ters of the convent. They were &s;oon routed, obliged to leave PARIS, and lived for &s;ome years an errant and a vagrant life, during which time the lady brought him two more children.</P>
<P>At length he was taken, again put into pri&s;on, and immediately condemned to make the <HI>amende honorable</HI> in the chamber of the <HI>Chatelet,</HI> and to be bani&s;hed the kingdom for nine years, and at the &s;ame time his lady's cau&s;e was determined, which deci&s;ion relea&s;ed her hu&s;band from all charge upon her ac|count, and obliged LE NOBLE to provide for her and her three children. What degree of ignomi|nious puni&s;hment he &s;u&s;tained we are not told, but one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it was as &s;light as the nature of the circum&s;tance would admit, for he was permitted after a &s;hort bani&s;hment to return to FRANCE, where he figured away with incredible reputation as a writer.</P>
<P>His troubles, however, had no power to re&s;train his irregularities. He continued incorrigible the whole of his life, and, at length, died in con&s;equence of his di&s;&s;ipation, at the age of &s;ixty eight, and was
<PB N="112" REF="104">
buried at the expence of the pari&s;h, after having gained the book&s;ellers a hundred thou&s;and crowns. His works, which are publi&s;hed in twenty volumes, are upon various &s;ubjects, and generally well written. Among them are to be found four dramatic pieces; which, like tho&s;e of FONTENELLE, and LA FON|TAINE, &s;eem to have been more the fruits of lei&s;ure hours than the employment of that time which he devoted to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his literary reputation.

<P><PB N="113" REF="105">PALAPRAT was born at TOULOUSE, in 1650. As a poet he had a lively and plea&s;ant imagination, and as a man he was candid, ingenuous, and un|offending.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. CREBILLON AND THE STATE OF TRAGEDY TO VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<P>CREBILLON, who &s;tands at the head of tho&s;e dra|matic writers that immediately &s;ucceeded RACINE, now claims our attention; he being the only author who knew how to make advantage of the occa&s;ion that then pre&s;ented it&s;elf of emulating the reputation of CORNEILLE and RACINE, without imitating either of them.</P>
<P>CREBILLON was born at DIJON, of an ancient and noble family, in 1674, and died at PARIS in 1762. He was intended by nature to pur&s;ue in literature a career of his own, which was the more fortunate for him as CORNEILLE had appropriated to him&s;elf the maje&s;ty, and RACINE the tender|ne&s;s of tragedy. He di&s;dained to follow their &s;teps, perhaps le&s;s impelled by choice than compul&s;ion; genius &s;eldom balances; it decides. It projects le&s;s than it executes.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="109">CREBILLON, determined to chu&s;e a &s;ure road, &s;truck into the path that AESCHYLUS had trod be|fore him; which he pur&s;ued with a &s;trength and a regularity that AESCHYLUS never knew. His &s;tyle was all nerve, all force; it had neither the elevation of CORNEILLE, nor the elegance of RACINE. He preferred a&s;toni&s;hment to admiration, &s;trength to harmony, and his male and vigorous pencil &s;eldom drew any but terrible objects. It was a tyrant who, while he exacted your obedience, made you trem|ble in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>CREBILLON's fir&s;t tragedy, <HI>Idom&eacute;n&eacute;e,</HI> was brought out in 1705. The public balanced at the bold &s;tyle in which it was written, and complained again&s;t the fifth act. It was withdrawn and a new fifth act written, when its &s;ucce&s;s was prodigious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOILEAU, who never could be quiet, &s;aid, that this tragedy &s;eemed as if written by RACINE when he was drunk.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Atree et Thye&s;te,</HI> produced in 1707, gave CREBILLON's reputation &s;tronger footing. Never|thele&s;s the boldne&s;s of his &s;tyle induced the au|dience on the fir&s;t night to pau&s;e on its merits. It was impo&s;&s;ible to blame, but they knew not to what degree to applaud judiciou&s;ly<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">CREBILLON u&s;ed to relate to his friends, that after the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of this piece, he encountered an Engli&s;h gentleman in a coffee hou&s;e, who paid him many compliments on his tragedy, of which he doubted the &s;incerity, as the piece was then hanging in a dubious &s;tate. <Q REND="inline">"Sir,"</Q> &s;aid CREBILLON,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am afraid you are pre|mature in your prai&s;es."</Q>

grew, however, on the public and became a great favourite.</P>
<P><HI>Electre</HI> came out in 1708, with much reputation, but <HI>Radami&s;te et Zenobie,</HI> lifted the &s;ame of CRE|BILLON to that height where it has ever &s;ince de|&s;ervedly been placed. It is certainly one of the <HI>chef d'oeuvres</HI> of the French theatre, and the a&s;toni&s;h|ing &s;ucce&s;s it met with was greatly its due<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOILEAU, who was then on his death bed, could not, never|thele&s;s, re&s;i&s;t his blended propen&s;ity of ill nature and inju&s;tice.

In his next piece, <HI>Xerxes,</HI> brought forward in 1714, he was le&s;s happy. It had but one repre&s;entation. When it was over he a&s;ked for the parts from the actors and burnt them before their faces, &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was in the wrong, the public have undeceived me."</Q>
There is good writing in this piece, but the author killed almo&s;t all the characters; a circum|&s;tance
<PB N="119" REF="111">
at which the French have always with ju&s;tice revolted.</P>
<P><HI>Semiramis</HI> came out in 1717. This is the play which, as we &s;hall hereafter &s;ee, VOLTAIRE took for the model of his tragedy under that title, and which induced &s;o many &s;quibs and epigrams at his expence. It had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s when CRE|BILLON fir&s;t produced it. <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> performed in 1762, was a tragedy written upon a new model; and, therefore, did not greatly &s;ucceed. CREBILLON had been reproached with introducing &s;o much cruelty on the &s;tage, that he, therefore, re&s;olved to try his hand at tenderne&s;s. We are told he worked for five years at this tragedy, and, at la&s;t, though it had its particular merits, the audience gave but little credit to them, becau&s;e written by a man who, in&s;tead of the pathetic, had been ac|cu&s;tomed to produce the terrible.</P>
<P>As <HI>Catalina,</HI> CREBILLON's next piece, was not produced till 1748, at which time he might be con|&s;idered as cotemporary with VOLTAIRE, I remit a further account of him till that time; when, as far as it may be nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall al&s;o notice his &s;on.</P>
<P>LONGEPIERRE, who was celebrated for three tragedies under the titles of <HI>Medee, Electre,</HI> and

<HI>Se&s;o&s;tris,</HI> was a proof how extremely difficult au|thors found it to &s;teer, like CREBILLON, wide of CORNEILLIE and RACINE, and yet &s;ucceed. Search|ing for the beauties of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, they forgot the age in which they were writing. <HI>Med&eacute;e,</HI> which is &s;aid to have been &s;uperior to COR|NEILLE, is full of declamation, cold, unequal, and prolix. <HI>Electre,</HI> from which piece, however, VOL|TAIRE has not di&s;dained to borrow &s;ome circum|&s;tances in his <HI>Ore&s;te,</HI> is a Greek dre&s;&s;ed in a French habit, a &s;tatue of PRAXITELES disfigured by a modern bungler; and, as for <HI>Se&s;o&s;tris,</HI> it was per|formed but once, and was never printed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is a curious anecdote of RACINE relative to this piece. He wrote an epigram&mdash;for which the following lines may &s;erve as a tran&s;lation&mdash;immediately after the failure of <HI>Se&s;o&s;tris,</HI> which came out three years after his <HI>Athalie.</HI><Q><LG TYPE="epigram">

</LG></Q></P>

<P>It was RACINE's foible now and then to di&s;til from his pen a little of BOILEAU's gall; and, having &s;ancred that he had here made a good hit, he circulated the&s;e lines as generally as he could; but hearing that LONGEPI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">RR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> had written a parallel between him and CORNEILLE, and completely given him the victory, he indu&s;triou&s;ly collected the copies back again, and did every thing in his power to prevent his being known as the author.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="113">LA GRANGE CHANCEL, who wrote with con|&s;iderable celebrity, would have en&s;ured him&s;elf a more brilliant fame had he not &s;ervilely followed RACINE, who, indeed, was his preceptor in the art of letters; if it be not a profanation to call that an art which is incapable of being taught by any other preceptor than nature.</P>
<P>LA GRANGE was born near PERIGUEUX, in 1676, and he died at PARIS, in 1760, having ren|dered him&s;elf remarkable for employing his pen from nine years old till within two years of his death. Having been puffed up with early &s;ucce&s;s, he ventured at &s;ome indi&s;creet &s;atires, for which he was confined in the I&s;lands of Saint MARGUERITE, whence, after a year, he contrived to e&s;cape; and, by means of friends which he conjured up wherever he went, he was kindly received by the king of SARDINIA, and afterwards he rendered him&s;elf u&s;eful to the king of SPAIN.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h nobles, jealous of this di&s;tinction, planned his de&s;truction, and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he e&s;caped a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Finding that SPAIN was no place for him, he embarked for AM|STERDAM. There he procured an introduction to
<PB N="122" REF="114">
the Amba&s;&s;ador of AUGUSTUS, king of POLAND, who finding him full of political intelligence, took him to POLAND at his return, where AUGUSTUS invited him to his court and made him con&s;iderable pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>After the death of tho&s;e he had &s;atirized, who had been his per&s;ecutors in FRANCE, he ventured to return to his native country. The mini&s;ters of &s;tate very &s;oon courted his alliance, know|ing that the intelligence he mu&s;t have gathered by his intimate knowledge of the affairs of foreign courts would render him of infinite &s;ervice to them in the pro&s;ecution of their views. This party he readily embraced and, after that, he lived &s;afe, fa|voured, and opulent.</P>
<P>His writings, which are full of genius and inex|perience, are a mixture of temerity and fear. Every thing is ventured, nothing prepared. Love and hatred, fury and moderation, are violently dragged in without motive or management. In&s;ults are com|mitted and pardoned, anger is kindled and extin|gui&s;hed, nobody knows why. Soaring after the &s;ub|lime he &s;eizes the bomba&s;t; and &s;tudying for the beautiful he is lo&s;t in the bathos. His grandeur is burle&s;que, and his &s;implicity puerility.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="115">The &s;everity of the&s;e truths, however, would not have attached to the writings of LA GRANGE, had he like CREBILLON di&s;dained imitation. His fir&s;t piece <HI>Adherbal,</HI> brought out in 1694, and written when he was only fourteen years of age, is &s;poken of as an a&s;toni&s;hing attempt for &s;uch a youth, and very probably he might have claimed the merit of an original writer had he not &s;uffered his fancy, at that tender &s;ea&s;on when the mind takes and retains im|pre&s;&s;ions, to be &s;o cramped and lamed as to have little power afterwards to exerci&s;e its natural functions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I had put the fini&s;hing &s;troke,"</Q> &s;ays LA GRANGE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to this tragedy, I hazarded the liberty of pre&s;enting it to the Prince&s;&s;e de CONTI; who in &s;pight of all its faults, found &s;ome|thing in it &s;o worthy her attention that &s;he &s;ent for the celebrated RACINE and entreated him to read this e&s;&s;ay, the&s;e were her words, of a young gentleman who was her page, and to give him his advice without di&s;gui&s;e. RACINE kept the piece eight days and then informed the Prince&s;s that he had read my tragedy with a&s;toni&s;hment; and though it was very defective in many places, if I would permit him to give me a few le&s;&s;ons, he had no doubt but in a &s;hort time it would be in &s;uch a &s;tate as to appear with &s;ucce&s;s. I did not fail to call on him every day for a con&s;iderable while, and may fairly &s;ay that I learnt more from him than from all the books I had ever read."</Q></P>
<P>Here it is evident that LA GRANGE took leave of nature to &s;tudy art in the &s;chool of RACINE; ju&s;t as painters become manneri&s;ts and are never afterwards capable of improvement. Going on he tells you that the piece came out, that he &s;at at its fir&s;t repre&s;entation with the Prince de CONTI who &s;aid that the author's age would &s;ilence the tongue of critici&s;m, and that under this influence the piece had wonderful &s;ucce&s;s. The circum&s;tance at any rate is not wonderful, for patronage would at that time do any thing with the public, and we have &s;een the &s;illy PRADON atchieve greater feats even again&s;t RACINE, through influence of a much inferior kind.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>LA FOSSE attempted what CREBILLON after|wards perfected. Like him he had a &s;trong mind; full of grandeur and dignity; but probably, fear|ing to attack &s;o revolting a &s;tyle of writing as terror which requires more &s;trength and &s;uror than maje&s;ty and tenderne&s;s, and is yet &s;ubordinate to both, he &s;trove in vain to imitate AESCHYLUS; till, finding how difficult it is to be original, he at length contented him&s;elf with copying CORNEILLE as &s;ervilely as LA GRANGE had copied RACINE; &s;o that, during the interval between CAMPISTRON and CREBILLON, tragedy langui&s;hed under the
<PB N="126" REF="118">
feeble &s;upport of the&s;e &s;hadows of two men, one of whom had given it life and vigour, and the other poli&s;h and refinement.</P>
<P>LA FOSSE wrote four tragedies, in which it is plain to be &s;een that CORNEILLE was the <HI>Phoebus</HI> to whom he conde&s;cended to become the <HI>Phoeton.</HI> The&s;e tragedies were called <HI>Polixene,</HI> brought out in 1696, <HI>Manlius Capitolinus</HI> in 1698, <HI>The&s;ee</HI> in 1700, and <HI>Cor&eacute;&s;us</HI> in 1703. Of all which plays it has been &s;aid, but of <HI>Manlius Capitolinus</HI> in par|ticular, that CORNEILLE might not have been a&s;hamed of being known as the author; but this is going a great deal too far; for, though they con|tain many pa&s;&s;ages that reflect a re&s;pectability on the writer, they are upon the whole heavy, dull, and unintere&s;ting; and evince the certain painful, difficult, and unfruitful re&s;ult of their pur&s;uits, who fetter genius, and &s;tudy to be natural.</P>
<P>Both LA GRANGE, and LA FOSSE, owe their re|putation, &s;uch as it was, and con&s;equently the notice taken of them here, to the adventitious circum&s;tance of appearing at a time when they could comfortably con&s;ider them&s;elves re&s;pectively as repre&s;entatives of CORNEILLE, and RACINE, merely becau&s;e they had no formidable opponent. And now, un|le&s;s I were to &s;ub&s;titute writings for literature, and

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. STATE OF THE FRENCH THEATRE ON TO THE YEAR 1730.</HEAD>
<P>FLUCTUATING, timid, irre&s;olute, and un&s;ettled, as the French &s;tage was at this period, nothing, per|haps, could have rai&s;ed its reputation to any pitch of excellence but the appearance of the only man who &s;eemed born to render his country that &s;ervice. Tragedy had been thitherto con&s;idered under three di&s;tinct heads; the grand, the tender, and the ter|rible; and the&s;e had &s;eparately been carried as far as po&s;&s;ible by CORNEILLE, RACINE, and CRE|BILLON. No man had dreamt that the French had never &s;een a real tragedy, a &s;pecies of production which to be perfect mu&s;t involve a union of the&s;e three great e&s;&s;entials, till VOLTAIRE, born with little genius, and le&s;s intuition, but endowed with a judgment almo&s;t equal to the happie&s;t efforts of both, plainly &s;hewed not only the practicability but the nece&s;&s;ity of this mea&s;ure, by fairly &s;tepping be|fore
<PB N="129" REF="121">
his three celebrated countrymen, and building a la&s;ting reputation for him&s;elf with the valuable materials they had left behind them.</P>
<P>It cannot, however, be denied that his fame is fair, hone&s;t, and legitimate; for though, had the&s;e authors never lived, he would have been at a lo&s;s how to have exerci&s;ed tho&s;e talents which had not been given to in&s;pire him with invention, though greatly to perfect the inventions of others; as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the e&s;&s;ence of their re&s;pective merits, as tho&s;e merits were rendered more brilliant in his hands, their ap|propriation more re&s;pectable, and as tho&s;e he added gave them a con&s;equence and a rank they had not been able to &s;upport alone, we cannot refu&s;e him the prai&s;e due to exertions &s;o highly meritorious.</P>
<P>But this is not all the length ju&s;tice obliges us to go. VOLTAIRE added to tragedy a colouring, a harmony, a fire, a variety, till then unknown to it. He did more. The tragic poets had contented them&s;elves with rendering vice odious; he rendered virtue amiable. His productions are the panegyric of humanity, and his moral appeals to all hearts.</P>
<P>VOLTAIRE was born at PARIS, November 30, 1694. He brought out on the French theatre
<PB N="130" REF="122">
twenty-eight plays, five of which appeared during the interval that will occupy this chapter.

ROUSSEAU wrote a letter to a friend which ac|cidently, or, perhaps, by connivance, fell into VOLTAIRE's hand. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of it:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have at la&s;t had the plea&s;ure of con&s;idering at my ea&s;e this marvellous dramatic &s;uperfetation, this &s;econd delivery of an abortion, taken again into the womb of of its mother to receive fre&s;h nouri&s;hment. The formation, how|ever, does not appear yet to me to be regular, and I can di&s;cern nothing from the head to the tail but a number of disjointed and mon&s;trous parts in&s;tead of a perfect and complete whole. In &s;hort it is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile this &s;arago with common &s;en&s;e. <HI>Ma|riamne</HI> is an inanimate doll that does not know what it does, nor what it wants; <HI>Varus</HI> is a hairbrain, who takes his mea&s;ures as &s;tupidly on the Banks of the JORDAN as the DANUBF; <HI>Herode,</HI> with his politics, is the &s;illie&s;t fellow of the whole troop; <HI>Salome,</HI> a mi&s;erable ra&s;cal who merits exemplary puni&s;hment; and <HI>Mazael,</HI> a clum&s;y rogue who &s;o far from accommodating him&s;elf to the intentions of his ma&s;ter &s;o injures and di&s;appoints them, that <HI>Herode,</HI> if he was not as mad as the author, ought to confine him within four walls."</Q>
He thus goes on at great length, minutely taking the play to pieces with great humour and ability, and then fini&s;hes by &s;aying, that when the con&s;truction and the writing are fairly e&s;timated, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay whether the author has &s;inned mo&s;t again&s;t rea&s;on or rhime.</NOTE>.</P>

Nothing more appeared of this author till 1730, when he brought out <HI>Brutus</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very material to notice that when VOLTAIRE brought out this tragedy he had ju&s;t returned from England; where&mdash;&s;pight of his affected indifference for the Engli&s;h poets, his rank and jealous abu&s;e of SHAKESPEAR, who&s;e genius was beyond his comprehen&s;ion, his unfair judgment of OTWAY, &s;inking him below RACINE, than whom he certainly wrote infinitely better&mdash;he learnt in what way to ri&s;e in the dramatic art &s;uperior to the be&s;t of his countrymen. This remains for &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>. In this tra|gedy VOLTAIRE completely over&s;hot his mark. Fired with the &s;pirit of Engli&s;h liberty, which with &s;o much adulation he had in ENGLAND defined to be a medium between tyranny and democracy, and which the Romans attempted but never could at|tain, its e&s;&s;ence &s;o evaporated in his pa&s;&s;age from DOVER to CALAIS, that in <HI>Brutus,</HI> written avowedly to promulgate the principles of Briti&s;h patrioti&s;m, he introduced all the levelling &s;entiments of a re|public, and expected the French to tolerate, under

<Q><SP>

<L>La liberte gravee, et les Rois en horreur,</L>
</SP></Q>
there was a general tumult. The piece, however, had its partizans, and tho&s;e it offended contented them&s;elves with barely &s;taying away from it. It, neverthele&s;s, &s;o injured the reputation of VOL|TAIRE that he did not recover it till he brought out <HI>Zaire,</HI> which might be called the fir&s;t complete tra|gedy in all its parts ever performed on the French &s;tage.</P>
<P>As I mean to draw up the mo&s;t celebrated of tho&s;e numerous authors who at this time attracted the notice of the public, and make them pa&s;s along in the view of the reader, I &s;hall follow up VOL|TAIRE with DE LA MOTTE, a man of great genius, and a mo&s;t fini&s;hed poet.</P>
<P>DE LA MOTTE wrote for the French theatre, the Italian theatre, and for the opera, and always
<PB N="134" REF="126">
re&s;pectably; but his poetic works, and particularly his odes, gave his fame the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial and permanent confirmation. He was born at PARIS in 1674. and died in 1731; &s;o that his whole public hi&s;tory may come in here.</P>
<P>DE LA MOTTE from his earlie&s;t youth had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to poetry, and a remarkable talent for declamation. This induced him to get by heart every thing that was celebrated, in which he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a memory &s;o quick and &s;o tenacious, that facts are averred of its effects almo&s;t beyond credibility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among many in&s;tances adduced to prove that DE LA MOTTE in point of memory was a &s;ort of prodigy, the following is parti|cularly worthy of notice. A young poet repeated in a large com|pany a tragedy which he had written. DE LA MOTTE, who was pre&s;ent, li&s;tened with great attention, and, when he had heard it out, told the young gentleman that it certainly had con&s;iderable merit, but that he was &s;orry to find him &s;o great a plagiari&s;t. The poet te&s;tified a&s;toni&s;hment at this a&s;&s;ertion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is well acted,"</Q> &s;aid DE LA MOTTE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but to convince you that I am right, I will now, repeat to you the whole of the &s;econd &s;cene in the fourth act."</Q>
This he in&s;tantly did; and in a manner as animated as if he him&s;elf had written it. The eyes of all the company were now turned on the young poet, who, thrown into a mo&s;t awkward embarra&s;&s;ment, knew not what to &s;ay; when DE LA MOTTE took him by the hand, &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Don't give your&s;elf any concern young gentleman; the &s;cene in que&s;tion is yours as well as the re&s;t of the piece; but it appeared to me &s;o beautiful, and &s;o afleeting, that I irre&s;i&s;tibly got, it by heart as you repeated it."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="127">DE LA MOTTE was an extraordinary character. He had &s;carcely made him&s;elf known but, without any apparent cau&s;e, he all of a &s;udden retired to the mona&s;try of DE LA TRAPPE; but the celebrated Abbe DU RANCE, unwilling to deprive the world of a young man of &s;uch promi&s;e, refu&s;ed him the habit under a pretence that he was too young to &s;u&s;tain all the rigid and &s;evere di&s;cipline of that au&s;tere order. After this he attached him&s;elf to the theatre, not without &s;ome ca&s;ui&s;tical qualms as to the propriety of how far his conduct was recon|cileable to the duty of a true chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But his conduct all through life was, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, fanciful and irre&s;olute. Having pa&s;&s;ed a long &s;eries of years in compo&s;ing mo&s;t beautiful ver&s;e, he fini&s;hed by decrying poetry as an unna|tural &s;pecies of writing. He compared ver&s;ifiers to &s;light-of-hand-men, who pa&s;s grains of millet through the eye of a needle, in which exploit there is no other merit than the difficulty; and, to prove the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, he turned his tra|gedy of <HI>Oedipe</HI> into pro&s;e, which he had before written in ver&s;e. This, however, drew on him a volley of epigrams which he was too much a phi|lo&s;opher to an&s;wer, though the be&s;t of them was infinitely below the wor&s;t of his poetry; but I
<PB N="136" REF="128">
&s;hall wind up his character after I have enumerated his pieces.</P>
<P>The tragedies of DE LA MOTTE are <HI>Macha|bees,</HI> performed in 1721, <HI>Romulus,</HI> in 1722, <HI>Ines de Ca&s;tro,</HI> in 1723, and <HI>Oedipe,</HI> in 1726. When DE LA MOTTE produced <HI>Machabees,</HI> he kept him&s;elf aloof as the author. In con&s;equence of this the play was immediately attributed to RACINE; but as the truth got wind, tho&s;e wi&s;e critics gradually pretended that upon maturer con&s;ideration they had found, by comparing one author with the other, that it could be written by nobody but DE LA MOTTE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROUSSEAU was one of tho&s;e who had been deceived. He excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying that, as there were no points, no flowery ideas, no flights, no fine&s;&s;e in this tragedy, he had conceived that it was impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be written by DE LA MOTTE. ROUSSEAU probably had forgotten that DE LA MOTTE knowing perfectly the different properties, of lyric odes, and other &s;anciful poetry, he al&s;o knew the properties of tragedy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Romulus</HI> was greatly &s;ucce&s;sful, and excited much curio&s;ity, both from the public and the dif|ferent authors. Parodies, at the Italian theatre, and the fairs, were at that time the te&s;t of dramatic &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Romulus</HI> was parodied at the Italians by DOMINIQUE, under the title of <HI>Arlequin Romulus,</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="129">
and at the puppet &s;hew by LE SAGE and FUZELIER, by the name of <HI>Pierrot Romulus.</HI> The parodies, however, were damned, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the tra|gedy confirmed.</P>
<P><HI>In&eacute;s de Ca&s;tro</HI> had &s;till greater &s;ucce&s;s than <HI>Ro|mulus.</HI> Never piece attracted &s;o many &s;pectators and &s;o much critici&s;m<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DE LA MOTTE being one day at a coffee-hou&s;e, he pre&s;ently heard a knot of the&s;e critics abu&s;e his play; when, finding that he was unknown to them, he joined heartily in abu&s;ing it him&s;elf.

<PB N="138" REF="130">
ver&s;e again&s;t his own opinion, had but little &s;ucce&s;s for that very rea&s;on; and, when he turned it into pro&s;e, it did not &s;ucceed at all. This induced him to defend his conduct; which it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed he did very ably, for, indeed, he was upon good ground. VOLTAIRE replied to him; and, as he had a real regard for DE LA MOTTE, u&s;ed in his arguments every po&s;&s;ible politene&s;s and delicacy. DE LA MOTTE, under the plea&s;ante&s;t irony, couched his arguments in the &s;ame terms, and this called forth innumerable &s;quibs levelled at the&s;e polite enemies. Madame DACIER mixed in the di&s;pute; but, di&s;daining VOLTAIRE's, or any body's polite|ne&s;s, this female ARISTOPHANES reprobated in un|qualified terms every requi&s;ite of the drama but its barbarity, which one &s;hould naturally &s;uppo&s;e is not a requi&s;ite. It fini&s;hed by DE LA MOTTE's leaving the theatre.</P>
<P>DE LA MOTTE wrote for the French theatre two comedies, and five for the Italian theatre. The &s;ubjects are principally taken from the Tales of DE LA FONTAINE, or rather from tho&s;e whence they were taken by him. They are mo&s;t of them per|formances of merit, for, indeed, it was impo&s;&s;ible for DE LA MOTTE to write ill, but they are cer|tainly the mo&s;t inferior of his works. His operas, twelve in number, are clearly upon the whole
<PB N="139" REF="131">
the be&s;t of his dramatic writings; for, though as to the general requi&s;ites of opera writing, QUINAULT &s;tood certainly before all other French poets, though far behind METASASIO, yet, for the true, grand, extended idea of lyric writing, DE LA MOTTE was infinitely &s;uperior to them both, of which his incomparable odes are an incontro|vertible proof. DE LA MOTTE's operas were com|po&s;ed by various mu&s;icians, among whom were CAMPRA, DESTOUCHES, MARAIS, COLASSE, and LA BARRE.</P>
<P>DE LA MOTTE was loved and e&s;teemed both in public and in private the whole of his life. His genius was brilliant, his under&s;tanding commanding, and his manners amiable, to which his writings bear ample te&s;timony. They are the effu&s;ions of a great mind regulated by a found judgment. Alike a &s;tranger to rancour or adulation, not a &s;ingle line of &s;atyric &s;everity has e&s;caped from his pen, nor has he, though his heart teemed with philanthropy, and though it was his delight to prai&s;e, in one &s;ingle in|&s;tance conde&s;cended to flatter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t not be objected that his odes, which are avowedly panegyric, are flattery. Great men and celebrated actions require from the poet &s;trong and enthu&s;ia&s;tic language. The mo&s;t luxuriant frights of fancy may be permitted, and the mo&s;t flowery fields of imagination traver&s;ed, in &s;earch of &s;uitable wreaths for the brows of heroes, philo&s;ophers, and legi&s;lators. DE LA MOTTE in this has followed PINDAR, and I know not in &s;ome in&s;tances that he has not equalled him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="132">DESTOUCHES demands our next attention, on whom it will be the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge, be|cau&s;e almo&s;t the whole of his productions have been in one form or another exhibited on the Engli&s;h theatre, and will, therefore, of cour&s;e require an inve&s;tigation in their place. He was born at TOURS, in 1680, and bred up to arms, in which profe&s;&s;ion he &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf that he grew into great e&s;teem with his &s;uperiors.</P>

It is by much the be&s;t of his plays.</NOTE>, this was &s;ucceeded by <HI>L'Envieux,</HI> and <HI>Les Philo&s;ophes Amoureux,</HI> which are all that ap|peared of this author till 1730.</P>
<P>What DESTOUCHES ought principally to be commended for is his endeavouring to give the French &s;tage a con&s;equence that it had before been a &s;tranger to; but, in cutting up frivolity, he has lo&s;t &s;ight of humour. His principal character is always a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, by the &s;ide of which the &s;ubordinate per&s;onages &s;tand like mere pigmies, and are totally lo&s;t in our contemplation of the grandeur and &s;tupidity of the primary object; which after all would no more attract our attention than any other mon&s;trous figure, did not &s;ome accommodating LY|SIMON, or GERONTE, like a wild bea&s;t-man, play off its &s;ingularities and explain its extraordinary qualities.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="134">It mu&s;t not, however, be denied that in DES|TOUCHES there are many beauties; in his intrigue he is happier than MOLIERE, and in his moral more cha&s;te than REGNARD, for between the&s;e two he &s;eems ambitious to place him&s;elf. He is, however, too dry, too &s;ententious; and, if the ob&s;ervation may be permitted, too wi&s;e, and too regular. He is generally without &s;aillies, or embelli&s;hments; which, when rigourou&s;ly judged, are &s;ometimes frivolous and mi&s;placed; yet, when judiciou&s;ly in|troduced, they enliven the mind and warm it to a more willing acknowledgement of the plea&s;ure of truth.</P>
<P>MARIVAUX, who&s;e writings claim the highe&s;t prai&s;e for their ingenious, bold, and meritorious tendency, &s;tarted like a true genius with a deter|mination to become original. He went, however, in &s;ome re&s;pects upon a fal&s;e principal. Having mo&s;t uncommon powers of language, and fancying his predece&s;&s;ors had exhau&s;ted all that it was po&s;&s;ible to do with character, he re&s;olved to turn entirely to &s;ubjects of intrigue; which, in proportion as they admit of variety to infinity, lo&s;e known and ac|knowledged manners, and, therefore, wander out of of nature's &s;ight.</P>
<P>'Tis too much to attempt to analyze the heart.
<PB N="143" REF="135">
Plea&s;ant traits, pretty thoughts, new &s;ituations, agreeable repartees, and lively &s;ailies, are all thrown away when they are u&s;ed to betray motives, in&s;tead of develop actions. MARIVAUX goes for the applau&s;e of the mind in&s;tead of the heart; the pro|vince of comedy is to command the applau&s;e of both. Full of genius, he expo&s;es nothing but in|genuity; certainly fraught with fine&s;&s;e, with delicacy, with grace, and with &s;entiment; but, neverthele&s;s, frequently tire&s;ome, and often almo&s;t inexplicable. The French are remarkable for &s;aying a great deal without intere&s;t, upon nothing; MARIVAUX has the knack of making the nothing, on which he &s;ays a great deal, intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>MARIVAUX brought out on the French and Italian theatres thirty-&s;ix pieces, generally in three acts and in pro&s;e; thirteen of which were performed before 1730. They &s;eldom had &s;ucce&s;s at &s;tarting, and it was his u&s;ual ob&s;ervation that he con&s;idered it more flattering to his reputation that they &s;hould plea&s;e on repetition than at fir&s;t. Many of them, however, never recovered the blow, and it is pro|bably owing to the extraordinary, the inconceivable ingenuity they contain, that any of them kept the &s;tage for a length of time.

<P>DESTOUCHES generally lived in retirement on an e&s;tate purcha&s;ed near MELUN.

which was called <HI>Annibal,</HI> many of which &s;ucceeded with per&s;ons of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment, but were ge|nerally withdrawn after a time to form the delight of the clo&s;et, where they are beyond mea&s;ure charming. MARIVAUX lived e&s;teemed, and died regretted at the age of &s;eventy five.</P>
<P>DE LA MOTTE, DESTOUCHES, and MARIVAUX, were members of the French academy. DE LA MOTTE &s;ucceeded T. CORNEILLE, DESTOUCHES was cho&s;en in the place of CAMPISTRON, and MARIVAUX was elected at the death of the Abbe de HOUTEVILLE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The preliminary di&s;cour&s;e of DE LA MOTTE was an&s;wered by Mon&s;ieur de COLLIERES, director of the academy.

<P>DESTOUCHES was replied to by FONTENELLE, who delivered a mo&s;t ma&s;terly and eloquent harrangue, certainly the eulogium of the King and the Cardinal de POLIGNAC, rather than DESTOUCHES. It was, however, wound up very powerfully, and the academy were congratulated on receiving, in their new member, a &s;ub&s;titute in co|medy for what CAMPISTRON had been in tragedy.</P>
<P>MARITAUX was addre&s;&s;ed by the Archbi&s;hop of SENS, who mo&s;t delicately and adroitly excu&s;ed him&s;elf for having been enticed out of the regular path of literature, in which it had been his cu&s;tom and his duty to walk, by the fa&s;cinating inducements thrown out by the writings of the new academician. He recapitulated the beauties in his works, warned him again&s;t painting love too voluptuou&s;ly, and fini&s;hed by giving him that tribute of prai&s;e which warm and &s;incere as it was, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"was but the echo of the multitude."</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="145">St. FOIX, a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and elegant writer, unfortunately for the cau&s;e of literature dealt in nothing but trifles; trifles, however, only in &s;ize, for, in value, they were ine&s;timable. St. FOIX was too independent both in mind and cir|cum&s;tances to drudge regularly for the theatre, otherwi&s;e there cannot be a doubt but he would have brought comedy in FRANCE to the true&s;t perfection. Full of novelty, yet full of nature, with a correct knowledge of every dramatic re|qui&s;ite, and a mo&s;t penetrating judgement to give tho&s;e requi&s;ites effect, his dialogue, nobly &s;imple, agreeably playful, and deliciou&s;ly intere&s;ting, the whole domain of Thalia &s;eemed open to his view, in which he was permitted to range for fancy, and variety.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. THE OPERA.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING brought the opera forward to the death of LULLY and the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of QUINAULT, I &s;hall as briefly as po&s;&s;ible give &s;uch further parti|culars concerning it as may &s;erve to a&s;&s;i&s;t my future account of it when I come to &s;peak of its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in ENGLAND. Brief, indeed, I mu&s;t be; for, be&s;ides tho&s;e operas already mentioned, I reckon more than two hundred, good and bad, that were brought out from their e&s;tabli&s;hment up to the year 1773.</P>
<P>In the&s;e operas authors of all de&s;criptions had a hand, from T. CORNEILLE, DE LA MOTTE, MARMONTEL, ROI, DANCHET, and even VOL|TAIRE, to LE ABBE PELLEGRIN, BERNARD, MON|DORGE, BRUERE, and CAHUSAC, down to many others of much more incon&s;iderable talents. Some of the mu&s;icians I have already named; to the&s;e may be added ROYER, MATHEAU, MOURET, MON|TECLAIRE, and many others who were, at length, completely eclip&s;ed by RAMEAU. It &s;hould not, however, be forgotten that the celebrated PHI|LIDORE,
<PB N="157" REF="149">
who&s;e mu&s;ic was almo&s;t as famous as his che&s;s, compo&s;ed an opera called <HI>Ernelinde</HI> written by POINSINET.</P>
<P>RAMEAU, who was born in 1683, was induced by his pa&s;&s;ion for mu&s;ic, and his thir&s;t after im|provement to vi&s;it ITALY very early in life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not my intention to &s;peak of mu&s;ic at length till I treat of its progre&s;s in ENGLAND. I &s;hall then &s;how how it took root and grew in every country, and that it always arrived to the true&s;t perfection whenever it was tran&s;planted from the garden of ITALY.</NOTE>. There he had formed his ta&s;te upon PERGOLESE, JOMELLI, GALLUPPI, CORELLI, and all that &s;tring of celebrated compo&s;ers who exactly at that time had brought mu&s;ic to the highe&s;t degree of perfection. It mu&s;t be under&s;tood, however, that it was not by their in&s;truction, but merely by li&s;ten|ing to their admirable compo&s;itions, that he became &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a mu&s;ician. Never did he receive from any man a &s;ingle le&s;&s;on on harmony. Nature and his own &s;trong mind were his preceptors; and &s;o well was he taught by &s;uch in&s;allible in&s;tructors that he at length became a harmonic legi&s;lator; a mu&s;ical LYCURGUS; to the ju&s;tice of who&s;e laws the whole tribe of compo&s;ers have implicitly bowed obedience.</P>
<P>The French were &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tically attached to
<PB N="158" REF="150">
that dull monotonous &s;tyle of mu&s;ic introduced by LULLY, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty RA|MEAU could prevail upon even the mo&s;t indifferent writers to &s;upply him with words, and he was fifty-five years of age when he promi&s;ed the Abbe PEL|LEGRIN, a poor re&s;ource by the by, a large &s;um of money to write <HI>Hypolite et Aricie,</HI> which was performed in 1733. It was at fir&s;t damned, but being again brought forward at the in&s;tance of &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;cernment, it &s;o opened the eyes, or ra|ther the ears of the nation, that a new character was from that hour given to the mu&s;ical ta&s;te of the French. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;econd repre&s;entation was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the noble conduct of PELLEGRIN, the author, and CAMPRA, RA|MEAU's profe&s;&s;ional rival. PELLEGRIN, &s;truck with the effect of the mu&s;ic, tore the in&s;trument to pieces which RAMEAU had given him as a &s;ecurity for his money, &s;aying he pitied the ta&s;te of the French, and that he was but too happy to fall in &s;uch company; and CAMPRA being a&s;ked what he thought of the mu&s;ic, &s;aid there was good mu&s;ic enough in <HI>Hypolite</HI> to &s;erve for ten operas. This was told to the Prince de CONTI, who a&s;ked if the&s;e were really his &s;en|timents? He an&s;wered, that the declaration was no more than truth and ju&s;tice, for that RAMEAU was certainly born to eclip&s;e their whole tribe. This prediction was completely verified, for no other mu&s;ician had brilliant &s;ucce&s;s after this event. The con&s;equence was that tho&s;e who happened to po&s;&s;e&s;s good &s;en&s;e and hone&s;ty like CAMPRA, gave way without murmuring; but the re&s;t, among whom were MONTECLAIRE, and MOURET, became a prey to envy and de&s;pair. MONTECLAIRE attacked RAMEAU on his violating the rule of harmony; but, happening, by way of &s;hewing his candour, to prai&s;e the only pa&s;&s;age in the opera of <HI>Les Indes Galantes</HI> written by FUZELIER, in which the rules of harmony were actually vio|lated, he was &s;o completely laughed at that he never ventured after|wards to &s;peak of RAMEAU or his mu&s;ic. As for poor MOURIT, it is a literal fact that he went mad and employed him&s;elf during his highe&s;t paroxy&s;ms in &s;inging a chorus in the &s;econd act of <HI>Ca&s;tor et Pollux,</HI> written by BERNARD, and compo&s;ed by RAMEAU, begining with the&s;e words:
<Q><SP>
<L>Qu'an feu du tonnerre,</L>
<L>Le feu des enfers</L>
<L>Declare la Guerre.</L>
</SP></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>After this, authors were &s;olicitous enough to write for RAMEAU. MONDORGE, BRUERE, CA|HUSAC, and AUTREAU, were all employed by him. At length VOLTAILE, who has told us he went out of his way to oblige a man of &s;uch talents, wrote for him <HI>Le Temple de la Gloire,</HI> which was followed by

<PB N="159" REF="151">
<HI>Pygmalion,</HI> written by DE LA MOTTE, and com|po&s;ed by LA BARRE in 1700. but re&s;et by RAMEAU in 1746. After this he had the good fortune to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the pen of MARMONTEL, who wrote for him four pieces, by which time the French opera had ari&s;en to its highe&s;t degree of per&s;ection.</P>
<P>After all, the opera in France, admirable as the talents of RAMEAU were, never equalled, or even approached the Italian opera. The va&s;t theatres of VENICE, MILAN, and other places gave a &s;tyle and a magnificence to the &s;cenery greatly beyond the &s;cenery of the French. The advantage of
<PB N="160" REF="152">
&s;etting Italian words to Italian mu&s;ic, &s;uch mu&s;ic e&s;pecially as was produced by the joint labours of &s;o many wonderful compo&s;ers, again threw the French opera at an immen&s;e di&s;tance. In &s;hort in nothing but the dances, by the way a mere apendage to the opera, have the French excelled, but in the&s;e they have ever excelled all EUROPE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A celebrated Engli&s;h dancer called on the famous MARCEL at PARIS, who de&s;ired to have a &s;pecimen of his abilities.

<P>The performances at PARIS derived great re|&s;pectability from their regulations by the order of the king. After the death of LULLY, who had at lea&s;t the merit of being a &s;trict di&s;ciplinarian, the opera relaxed greatly from the regularity and good order that had been before kept up. This induced the king, in 1713, to i&s;&s;ue an arret con&s;i&s;ting of eighteen articles, which enacted that the director of the Royal Mu&s;ical Academy &s;hould chu&s;e the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible performers both vocal and in&s;trumental, and al&s;o performers for the ballets; no one, however, to be received without the approbation of the in|&s;pector general.

<P><PB N="161" REF="153">That the different merits of the performers being a&s;certained and by them acknowledged, they &s;hould receive &s;uch parts as were provided for them with|out murmuring, upon pain of being deprived of a month's pay for the fir&s;t omi&s;&s;ion, and of being di&s;|charged for the &s;econd. Their duty both towards one another, and towards the public, is next very pro|perly pointed out, the portion of the profits equitably appropriated, a fund e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;uch as may have performed fifteen years, not as a charity but as a reward for pa&s;t &s;ervices, and another fund, by way of encouraging emulation to be at &s;tated periods di|vided among all tho&s;e who may have be&s;t di&s;charged their duty towards their employers and the public.</P>
<P>It is next ordered that, during all rece&s;&s;es, the per|formers, without di&s;tinction, &s;hall be put upon half pay; afterwards that the authors and compo&s;ers of all operas &s;hall be paid in proportion to their &s;ucce&s;s on every night as far as thirty repre&s;entations, provided the opera is performed &s;o many nights in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.

<P>Per&s;ons were, in con&s;equence of this new regu|lation, immediately appointed, and it was, without variation, ever afterwards kept up. In 1773, the appointments &s;tood thus: REBEL at the head of the mu&s;ical academy, FERRET and PARANT principal conductors of the &s;inging &s;chool, the two GARDELS regulators of the dancing &s;chool; among the prin|cipal male &s;ingers were GELIN, LARRIVEE, DU|RAND, LE GROS, MUGUET, TIROT, and LAINEZ; the principal female &s;ingers were LARRIVEE, AR|NOULD, DUPLANT, BEAUMESNIL, ROSALIE, DU|RANC, 1 CHATEAUNEUF, and GIRARDIN, and there were about thirty others employed in choru&s;es and other inferior &s;tations.</P>
<P>VESTRIS was the ballet ma&s;ter, who was al&s;o principal dancer with GARDEL and DUBERVAL. Next came a train of figurants; then the principal women, who were PESLIN, GUIMARD, HEINEL, and ASSELIN, and then the figurantes and &s;upernu|meraries amounting to about fifty. The li&s;t was clo&s;ed by the names of tho&s;e who performed in the or|che&s;tra to the number of &s;ixty-four, &s;o that the whole company, including all de&s;criptions of per&s;ons em|ployed, mu&s;t have con&s;i&s;ted of at lea&s;t two hundred.</P>

This man fairly took up the ancient farces, of which I &s;hall not have a better opportu|nity to give an account than this. They were cer|tainly the origin of that prodigious number of pro|verbs, and pieces in one act, which have &s;pread them|&s;elves through FRANCE, either in private &s;ocieties, or on the &s;tage. They were without doubt originally the productions of the <HI>Children of Sans Souci,</HI> and at that time they contained, probably, either the burle&s;que of the Greek &s;atires, or the a&s;perity of the Roman, or, perhaps, a mixture of both; but, being neglected by them for works of greater magnitude when they joined the Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion, the&s;e farces were &s;u&s;pended, and would have been altogether lo&s;t if &s;ome of the buffoons had not afterwards re&s;tored them; who, not being &s;ufficiently informed to imi|tate Greeks and Romans, made a &s;hift to invent a great deal of drollery by ridiculing the folly of their own countrymen.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e PATHELIN, TABARIN, GUILLOT GORJU, GAUTIER GARGUILLE, GROS GUIL|LAUME, and TURLUPIN, were the principal. The la&s;t three were journeymen bakers, and friends from their infancy. It is difficult to a&s;certain whether the&s;e farces, which they performed upon their own

<P>For the purpo&s;e of performing the&s;e farces they took a &s;mall tennis court, near <HI>le porte St. Jaques,</HI> which they converted into a theatre. The price of admittance was two &s;ous and &s;ix deniers. They had &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s that the company of the <HI>Hotel de Bour|gogne</HI> complained of them to Cardinal RICHELIEU; who, being fond of every thing dramatic, &s;ent for them to perform before him in the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> which was then called his palace. They &s;atisfied the Cardinal &s;o well that he would not forbid their per|formance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ubject of the farce they were &s;aid to have performed before the Cardinal was as follows: GROS GUILLAUME, who is re|pre&s;ented to have been as thick as he was long, and who often, by means of a dre&s;s with hoops &s;tretched acro&s;s, formed him&s;elf into the figure of a hog&s;head, was in this farce &s;uppo&s;ed to be the wife of TURLUPIN; who, jealous of GARGUILLE, is determined to cut her head off. He &s;eizes her by the hair with a drawn &s;abre in his hand, while, &s;he upon her knees conjures him by every thing dear to him to abate his anger. She reminds him of their pa&s;t loves, how &s;he rubbed his back when he had the rheumati&s;m, and how charmed &s;he had always been when he wore his flannel night cap, but all in vain. Will nothing move thee? cries this amiable female in the la&s;t de&s;pair. Oh cruel! Think on the bacon and cabbage I fryed for you ye&s;terday. Oh the &s;orcere&s;s! cries TURLUPIN. I can't re&s;i&s;t her. She knows how to take me by my foible. The bacon! the very fat's now ri&s;ing in my &s;tomach. Live, fry cabbage, and be dutiful.</NOTE>. This &s;o emboldened them that they

grew more and more &s;curilous and per&s;onal; till GROS GUILLAUME, in one of their farces, coun|terfeited a certain magi&s;trate &s;o perfectly that he i&s;&s;ued a warrant to take them all up.

<P><PB N="168" REF="160">The names of Harlequin, Pantaloon, Scara|mouche, and the re&s;t of the pantomime characters, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been either the real or adven|titious titles of tho&s;e who fir&s;t performed them. The original Harlequin is &s;aid to have been a young per|former among the Italians at the time of HENRY the third; who being retained by the pre&s;ident HARLAY, was called by his companions, according to the Ita|lian cu&s;tom of giving the ma&s;ter's name to the &s;er|vant, Arlequino; a name that DOMINIQUE, GHER|ARDI, CARLIN, and others ever after went by. The names of Mezetin, Pantaloon, and &s;everal of the re&s;t are &s;aid to have been real; and thus, what|ever might be the &s;ubject, or whatever the &s;cene, you &s;aw the pieces always performed as it were, by one family. This bad cu&s;tom &s;pread it&s;elf through all their comic writings, which we &s;ee &s;tuffed with Damons, and Gerontes, and Ly&s;imons, and Era&s;tes, out of number, in&s;tead of tho&s;e appropriate names by which we di&s;tingui&s;h the variety of characters that are introduced in our comedies.</P>
<P>After the junction of the Italian theatre with the comic opera, they mu&s;tered very powerfully. CA|MILLE, an admirable Pantaloon, brought with him his daughter; a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and beautiful woman. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A large volume,"</Q> &s;ays my author,

She was an actre&s;s as well as a dancer, and admirable in both capacities. CLAIR|VAL was an excellent &s;inger and a &s;ound actor. CARLO VERONESE al&s;o brought out his daughter, CAROLINE, who performed the Colombine, that is to &s;ay, the chambermaid, for all the Harlequins at the Italian theatre were valets, and all the Colom|bines chambermaids; &s;he had almo&s;t as many ver&s;es written in her prai&s;e as CAMILLE: Some of them by MARMONTEL, who was in love with her.</P>
<P>To Madame FAVART, who&s;e merit in public, and who&s;e character in private life cannot be &s;poken of too highly, I lament that it is not in my power to do the ju&s;tice &s;he merited. She &s;ung charmingly, and performed with delicacy, truth, and &s;entiment. She was a perfect mu&s;ician, and played admirably on the harp. All the&s;e qualifications her hu&s;band availed him&s;elf of in the characters &s;he performed, which he wrote purpo&s;ely for her, and to which &s;he gave &s;o much grace and nature that her manner has been ever &s;ince the &s;tandard of imitation. In her private life &s;he was a tender wife, and mother, and a faithful and affectionate friend.</P>

<P>It is premi&s;ed, &s;ay the&s;e laws, that the company are under the immediate protection of the king, and mu&s;t render account to him of their conduct through the &s;uperintendant of his <HI>menus plai&s;irs,</HI> and the gen|tlemen of his chamber. The organ, through which all applications, reports, and appeals are to be con|veyed, to be compo&s;ed of three performers called <HI>Semainiers,</HI> or weekly in&s;pectors, cho&s;en by a ma|jority out of the company. The&s;e in&s;pectors are to have different departments. The fir&s;t is to take care of the regi&s;ters, to examine the receipts, and di&s;|bur&s;ements, and to act in every re&s;pect as guardian and trea&s;urer. He is to convoke all a&s;&s;emblies, and regulate with the con&s;ent of a majority of the com|pany, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the week; which, having been properly dige&s;ted, is to be announced by the bills to the public, and without good cau&s;e to the contrary, literally carried into execution.</P>
<P>The &s;econd in&s;pector is to examine the &s;tate of the company, the &s;tock li&s;t of performances, the merits of the performers, their forwardne&s;s as to the di&s;|charge of their duty; to &s;ee after the &s;tate of the
<PB N="171" REF="163">
decorations, to take care at performances and re|hear&s;als, that every decorum is ob&s;erved, and that nothing is neglected by actors, &s;ingers, dancers, pain|ters, or members of any other de&s;cription, that may render their exertions worthy the patronage of the king, and the encouragement of the public.</P>
<P>The third in&s;pector is to watch over the conduct of the other two, to render an account of every thing that pa&s;&s;es to the intendant <HI>Des Menus,</HI> and to in&s;truct the company as to what orders he receives in con&s;equence from court, and whether the pro|ceedings of the company are approved or di&s;ap|proved of by the king.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;pectors are to remain in office three weeks, and, during that time, to &s;erve re&s;pectively each office; the whole company, on every Saturday morning in full a&s;&s;embly, receiving an authentication of their fidelity in the di&s;charge of their &s;everal tru&s;ts, and being at liberty to examine their conduct, on which they may pa&s;s a vote of thanks or cen&s;ure, each performer voting according to the order of his or her reception in the company; at which a&s;&s;embly the king's plea&s;ure is to be made known, and re&s;olu|tions taken as to their future plans and operations; at all times &s;trictly adhering to the&s;e regulations.</P>
<P>Di&s;tributing of parts, for&s;eits, recompences over
<PB N="172" REF="164">
and above the common appointments, and fir&s;t ap|pearances are regulated as equitable as every thing el&s;e; but the&s;e, the duty of the performers, and other particulars, I &s;hall re&s;erve till I lay them by the fide of the Engli&s;h regulations. I cannot, how|ever, pa&s;s by the treatment of authors.</P>
<P>All authors, who think proper to &s;end pieces to the theatre, are to direct them to the &s;econd &s;e|mainier, who is to report the in&s;tructions which tho&s;e authors &s;hall think proper to &s;end with their per|formances to the company. If the author wi&s;hes to be concealed, they are to ob&s;erve inviolable &s;e|crecy. If it &s;hould be the opinion of the company that the piece ought to be read notice is given and the author invited, who may either read his piece him&s;elf or chu&s;e that performer from the company who he conceives will do it the greate&s;t ju&s;tice. The company are forbid to applaud or condemn, and the author is reque&s;ted, after the reading is over, to retire that the opinions of the actors may be given without re&s;traint.</P>
<P>The debate then begins, and it is put to the vote whether the piece &s;hall be received or not; with the determination the &s;econd &s;emainier acquaints the author; who, if he thinks proper, may in&s;i&s;t upon altering his piece and &s;ubmitting it to a &s;econd reading, and, if then he &s;hould remain di&s;&s;atisfied,
<PB N="173" REF="165">
he may ultimately in&s;i&s;t, through the third &s;emainier, of appealing to the intendant of <HI>Des Menus.</HI></P>
<P>The profits of the author are, for a fir&s;t piece, a ninth of the hou&s;e during the whole of the fir&s;t run, which &s;hall not be interrupted upon any account till the receipt &s;hall twice together be under a thou&s;and livres. The profits, on pieces of two acts, are a eighteenth, and on pieces of one act, a twenty-fourth of the receipt, &s;ubject to the &s;ame regulations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the pieces were mu&s;ical, the profits were &s;till the &s;ame but they were &s;hared between the author and compo&s;er.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. AUTHORS, AND THE FRENCH THEATRE TO THE DEATH OF VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<P>CREBILLON will now &s;tand forward; who, in 1748, and at the age of &s;eventy four, brought out <HI>Catalina,</HI> after labouring at it more than twenty years. It was greatly admired, and in particular the three fir&s;t acts, notwith&s;tanding the turn VOLTAIRE had given to tragedy. There were, however, in it &s;ome incongruous things, and it would not probably have obtained that notice from the public it met with, had not Madame POMPADOUR taken it under her pro|tection and pre&s;ented the actors with &s;uperb dre&s;&s;es for all the characters.</P>
<P><HI>Le Triumvirat</HI> came out in 1754, at which time CREBILLON was eighty. It had very re&s;pectable &s;ucce&s;s, and though his enemies, among whom may be reckoned his &s;on, &s;poke of it as a plagiary from the re&s;t of his works, and among others from a tragedy called <HI>Cromwel,</HI> which had been fordidden to appear, it certainly did no di&s;credit to his repu|tation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whenever the younger CRIBILLON was in company he made a point of decrying his father's works, even to his face. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How now,"</Q> &s;aid a friend one day,

 CREBILLON was received at the academy in 1731, and delivered his preliminary di&s;cour&s;e in ver&s;e. He was very much re&s;pected through life. At his funeral attended all the public bodies and private individuals who were e&s;teemed for literary pur&s;uits. Every mark of honour and re&s;pect was paid him, and the king at his private expence or|dered for him a hand&s;ome monument.</P>
<P>Among the remaining authors, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e already mentioned, who wrote for the &s;tage during the life of VOLTAIRE, at the French theatre, we find FONTENELLE, BRET, MOISSY, PALISSOT, BELLOY, FAGAN, GRESSET, LA GARDE, MER|CIER, DE MORAND, and a variety of others, and at the Italian theatre FAVART, ANSEAUME, SEDAINE, and many more.</P>
<P>FONTENELLE, who&s;e arduous and meritorious
<PB N="176" REF="168">
labours did &s;o much &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of literature in FRANCE, was the nephew of the great COR|NEILLE. Among his dramatic pieces, which alone are entitled to notice here, and which were written like tho&s;e of LA FONTAINE, rather for amu&s;ement than fame, are two or three of con&s;iderable merit. Not one, however, can be called perfect. There reigns every where in them a powerful and per&s;ua&s;ive &s;tyle, always ingenious, and often &s;educing, but there is an affectation of explaining &s;elf evident &s;en|timents different from other authors; a weakne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion that injures the &s;trength of the &s;entence. 'Tis a painted giant, a Hercules dre&s;&s;ed like a <HI>petit maitre</HI>; a fault, in &s;hort, that every judicious reader will &s;ee and ought to complain of, for unfortunately the faults of a great man are always dangerous, be|cau&s;e they are always imitated; and, what is wor&s;e, are ea&s;ily imitated by tho&s;e who have not capacity to imitate his perfections.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could with equal propriety enlarge upon the other publications of FONTENELLE, which are replete with in&s;truction and delight; and by which, through a long and laborious life, he de|&s;ervedly kept a brilliant reputation. To his honour, however, and the perpetuity of his fame, the literary world are competent to &s;peak his eulogium, and to enumerate all the particulars of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions
<PB N="177" REF="169">
which were heaped on him by the &s;uffrages of the French Academy, the Academy des Belles Lettres, and the Academy of Pru&s;&s;ia; of all which &s;ocieties he was a valuable member. He died at PARIS at the age of a hundred in 1757.</P>
<P>BOISSI wrote a great number of pieces for all the theatres; but they are negligently and &s;lovenly written, and on mere chit chat &s;ubjects, therefore, though they &s;erved well enough to expo&s;e and correct temporary folly, they have nothing in them from which may be expected a permanent repu|tation. His fir&s;t pieces, after a time, were generally reduced to farces, and &s;ometimes to one act<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The actors took this liberty &s;o mercile&s;sly with BOISSI, that he was not always very much &s;atisfied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why zounds,"</Q> &s;aid he one day,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if my plays are to be hacked and hewed in this manner, what &s;hall I do to have a piece repre&s;ented in five acts?"</Q>
Write it in eleven, &s;aid an actor.</NOTE>; and, after the whim, or the ab&s;urdity they were meant to laugh at, had gone by, they were heard of no more.</P>
<P>BRET produced &s;everal comedies for the French theatre, which are written with an elegant facility, natural, ju&s;t, and give proof of no mean knowledge in the dramatic art. PALISSOT &s;peaks of this au|thor in very hand&s;ome terms, and prai&s;es him in

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is written in the true &s;tyle of comedy, and the other is full of great tenderne&s;s and real intere&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>MOISSY, who produced eight or nine pieces, generally with &s;ucce&s;s, was an ea&s;y, elegant, and na|tural writer. His &s;tyle is flowing and lively. He was accu&s;tomed to mix with the highe&s;t characters in real life, which enabled him to paint genteel man|ners with great truth of colouring, but as there is in genteel company generally too much vapidity, he often wants force, humour, and intere&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About the time that MOISSY brought out his comedy of <HI>Les Deux Freres,</HI> BRET produced another called <HI>Les Deux Saeurs.</HI> Nei|ther of the&s;e plays had great &s;ucce&s;s. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What &s;hall I do,"</Q> &s;aid BOISSY to a friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with my two brothers?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Why,"</Q> &s;aid the friend,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I think you can't do better than marry them to BRET's two &s;i&s;ters."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>PALISSOT was a writer of con&s;iderable emi|nence. He attempted a tragedy at nineteen which was received as a work of great promi&s;e. The &s;ituations were intere&s;ting, and the &s;tyle was natural, and pure; but when he con&s;idered the extreme difficulty of entering the li&s;ts with VOLTAIRE, he
<PB N="179" REF="171">
very &s;en&s;ibly turned his hand to comedy, where he had a larger field to range, and where he might more freely exerci&s;e that pointed and &s;atyric vein which be&s;t &s;uited his genius.</P>
<P>Having made up his mind, he determined to become another ARISTOPHANES; and, that he might be the more con&s;picuous, he went to the very fountain head for materials. His fir&s;t comedy that became popular was called <HI>Les Originaux,</HI> and brought out at NANCY, in LORRAINE in 1755. In this play, without mincing the matter, he boldly drew the character of ROUSSEAU; not individually as to his per&s;on or his manners, but as his mind ap|peared in his writings. The adherents and di&s;ciples of ROUSSEAU, who were numerous, particularly in that town, pre&s;ented a memorial to the king of POLAND, duke of LORRAINE and of BAR. in which they prayed vengeance on the head of the author. The &s;torm was violent, but it was &s;hort. PALISSOT triumphed, and this oppo&s;ition only &s;erved to make him more popular, and encourage him to pur&s;ue a career for which his victory had &s;hewn he was &s;o qualified.</P>
<P>In 1760, PALISSOT brought out <HI>Les Philo&s;ophes,</HI> which contained &s;ome mo&s;t cutting and pointed &s;atire at all tho&s;e who were advocates for the fanciful
<PB N="180" REF="172">
and dangerous doctrines of ROUSSEAU, VOLTAIRE, and other authors of that &s;tamp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PALISSOT, in his Memoirs, &s;ays, that being honoured with the countenance and &s;upport of two ladies of high rank, to whom he dedicated a work, finding tho&s;e ladies libelled becau&s;e they pro|tected him, and &s;eeing very plainly that it was the intention of the libellers to compromi&s;e the matter with the ladies by inducing them to transfer their favour, under an idea that his arguments ought not to be rated in oppo&s;ition to theirs; he conceived it his duty to take the matter up. For this purpo&s;e, as the flanderers were public cha|racters, indeed VOLTAIRE is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been concerned in it, he thought he could not more completely do public ju&s;tice than by bringing them on the &s;tage, and offering up their dark opinions and their invidious philo&s;ophy, as a &s;acrifice to truth, to rea&s;on, and to decorum.</NOTE>. Its &s;ucce&s;s was beyond every thing that had been before repre&s;ented on the French theatre. The actors, through the intere&s;t of VOLTAIRE and the re&s;t, were induced to rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t it, and Madmoi&s;elle CLAIRON, at the head of a party, entered a prote&s;t alledging that it ought not to be performed becau&s;e it contained per&s;onalities. The drift of this, how|ever, being plainly &s;een upon an appeal, an order was i&s;&s;ued for its repre&s;entation.</P>

It being clearly di&s;covered, however, that the parties again&s;t it were intere&s;ted per&s;ons, or &s;uborned at their in|&s;tance, the favourers of the piece took up the quarrel as their own; and, after a long and warm altercation, its triumph was decided.

The con&s;e|quence was that CLAIRON was as much at a &s;tand as ever, and MAR|MONTEL hi&s;&s;ed once more for what he had not written.

<P>There was, however, another piece which VOL|TAIRE brought with him from FERNEI, when, like a hare, he came to PARIS to die.

<PB N="195" REF="187">
indeed, afflicted &s;ome time before<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time VOLTAIRE him&s;elf was acting a mo&s;t mi&s;erable farce. On his arrival in PARIS, he was vi&s;ited and enquired after with more &s;olicitude than if he had been an amba&s;&s;ador, or a mini&s;ter of &s;tate. Nothing was &s;poken of but VOLTAIRE. Nothing that could flatter his exce&s;&s;ive vanity was omitted. Every &s;yllable he uttered was cheri&s;hed like the prophe&s;ies of an oracle. His bon mots, his &s;allies, his mo&s;t trifling expre&s;&s;ions were retailed in all the journals and in all public companies. Happy they who caught from him a complacent glance, a conde&s;cending nod, or a gracious &s;mile. In the mean time, &s;ome individuals, who al&s;o knew how to act farces, re&s;olved to make his folly contribute to their intere&s;t. Among the&s;e was a certain Abbe GAULTIER, a name&s;ake at lea&s;t of a farce actor already &s;poken of. This man, who formerly had been a Je&s;uit, thought he could not better ingratiate him&s;elf with the Archbi&s;hop of PARIS than by bringing about VOLTAIRE's conver&s;ion to the church after he had been &s;o long con&s;idered as a notorious apo&s;late. For this purpo&s;e he determined to enter the li&s;ts with the actors and the philo&s;ophers, and combat with them lu&s;tily for the &s;oul of VOLTAIRE. He pe&s;tered him with letters; and the more he was tormented with bodily and mental infirmity the more he harra&s;&s;ed him; till, at length, the poor poet, with all his fear of eternity before him, was reduced to the mo&s;t pitiable &s;tate of pu&s;illanimity and irre|&s;olution. One minute he &s;ent for the prie&s;t, the next he denied him&s;elf to him. Now he wrote a recantation of his errors, pre|&s;ently he retracted it. The Abbe in the mean time was under the nece&s;&s;ity of putting every art in practice to carry his point, for he had DIDEROT, D'ALEMBERT, MARMONTEL, and others to manage, who wanted the poor philo&s;opher to die in peace. In proportion, however, as the patient's apprehen&s;ions encrea&s;ed, he gained the a&s;|cendancy. A full and complete abjuration of all the crimes VOL|TAIRE had committed again&s;t the chri&s;tian religion was drawn up, couched in terms equivalent to a confe&s;&s;ion that all that he had ever written was full of lies, a terrible prohibition for an author; to de&s;troy the credit of a long life of &s;tudy and its fruits contained in an hundred volumes by the &s;ingle da&s;h of the pen! This recantation was to be publi&s;hed in all the new&s;papers in EUROPE, and it contained in par|ticular a very artful condition; which was, that, as it had been re|ported that every precaution would be taken when he &s;hould be near his end, either by threats or denunciations to make him confe&s;s and &s;ign whatever might privately &s;erve the purpo&s;es of the church, or its mini&s;ters, and that, therefore, all he &s;aid or did under &s;uch re&s;traint ought to go for nothing, he not only abjured all knowledge of the&s;e or any other &s;imilar in&s;inuations, but prote&s;ted that whatever he &s;hould confe&s;s, and whatever he &s;hould &s;ign, would be the unbia&s;&s;ed effect of full conviction and a due &s;en&s;e of the manifold crimes he had committed, together with a nece&s;&s;ity for a &s;incere, a contrite, and an unequivocal repentance. The conditions were hard, and it required as much management to get them accepted as boldne&s;s to propo&s;e them; but nothing could intimidate the Abbe. He found he had hooked his fi&s;h, and it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to play with it pro|perly in order to bring it &s;afely to his hand. He enjoyed his amu&s;e|ment, however, with rather too much wantonne&s;s; for ju&s;t as he was on the point of gaining the reward of his dexterity, death broke the line and away went his prey to the bottom. In &s;hort, ju&s;t as VOLTAIRE had manife&s;ted an apparent con&s;ent, for an ab&s;olute one he never manife&s;ted, to the&s;e hard terms, he fell into a delirium and died, before he had received extreme unction, or done any other thing nece&s;&s;ary to his being con&s;idered as a chri&s;tian; and, therefore, though &s;tatues and mau&s;oleums were erected to his memory, and he was deified at the theatre, the church refu&s;ed him the rights of &s;epul|ture; nay, what is very extraordinary, they refu&s;ed to take their fees for fear of contamination.</NOTE>. This was the con&s;ummation, not of his glory, as he fondly called it, but of his vanity. Before the piece began, BRIZARD, the olde&s;t of the actors, entered the box
<PB N="196" REF="188">
and placed a crown of laurel upon his head, which he with an affected mode&s;ty attempted to return, at the &s;ame time exclaiming,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What will you over|whelm me? Will you kill me with exce&s;s of
<PB N="197" REF="189">
glory?"</Q>
The tragedy was then repre&s;ented; after this VOLTAIRE's &s;tatue was placed on the &s;tage; and, while the actors and actre&s;&s;es crowned it with laurel and performed a mo&s;t ridiculous and extravagant ceremony, the poet received all the honours of an apotheo&s;is.</P>
<P>Whether this exce&s;s of glory, or the exce&s;&s;ive importunities of the church, and his friends on one &s;ide, who wi&s;hed him to die a chri&s;tian, or the fol|lowers of his doctrines on the other, who were &s;o|licitous that he &s;hould remain what they called a philo&s;opher to the la&s;t, would have atchieved the victory it is hard to &s;ay: the conflict certainly ac|celerated his end. Pride, weakne&s;s, vanity, morti|fication, regret, fear, and a thou&s;and other warring pa&s;&s;ions agitated and convul&s;ed his frame; till, at length, a compa&s;&s;ionate delirium came to his relief, and he died a warning to &s;peculati&s;ts, and an awful example of unavailing compunction. This event happened May 30, 1778, when he was nearly eighty four years of age.</P>
<P>The church having forbid that the remains of this extraordinary man &s;hould be buried in con&s;e|crated ground, his relations with difficulty got leave to tran&s;port the body to FERNEI; but they managed to procure its burial at an Abbey of BERNARDINES at SCELLIERES, in the dioce&s;e of TROYE in CHAM|PAIGNE

The bi&s;hop of TROYES, how|ever, got intelligence of the bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;ent to forbid the interment, but the order came too late; it was, therefore, agreed that the body &s;hould not be taken up, but the bi&s;hop laid the chapel under an interdiction, and the prior was depo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wit upon this occa&s;ion wrote a di&s;titch which may be thus tran&s;lated:

<P>To go over the large field of VOLTAIRE's pro|ductions would be both unnece&s;&s;ary and improper. They are in all recollections and all libraries; and we have nothing to do here with any thing but his dra|matic productions.

VOL|TAIRE's judgment was &s;trong, faithful, and pene|trating, to a degree of wonder; and his recollection was &s;o vivid that his memory &s;erved him in the place of genius. Thus he was any writer he plea&s;ed, and better than the writer him&s;elf, becau&s;e he could dive&s;t him&s;elf of partiality. The ob&s;ervation, I confe&s;s, is again&s;t all rule, all example, but it is, neverthele&s;s, true in VOLTAIRE; who on every po&s;&s;ible &s;ubject could make you receive that as his

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. MUSICIANS, ACTORS, REGULATIONS, AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE FRENCH STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the moment RAMEAU reformed the mu&s;ic of the &s;erious opera, the &s;trange, trite, unmeaning jigs that had been dinned in the cars of every fre|quenter of the comic opera, and every pa&s;&s;er-by in the &s;treets, began to a&s;&s;ume &s;omething like me|lody; and, while the &s;tyle of the more important works of PERGOLESI, GALLUPPI, and their co|temporaries, made up the grandeur of French mu&s;ic, regulated by RAMEAU, the Venetian Ballads and the other lighter mu&s;ic of the Italian Serenatas, and In|termezzos, changed the complexion and gave a de|licacy to the Vaudvilles.</P>
<P>DUNI, following the example of RAMEAU, im|proved the comic opera as RAMEAU has improved the &s;erious opera. He was afterwards followed, among many others, by MONSIGNY, by PHILI|DORE, and, at length, by GRETRY, at which time French mu&s;ic had gone beyond its &s;trength, and the &s;tring was &s;tretched till it cracked.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="194">DUNI was cha&s;te and correct, but he &s;eemed to compo&s;e tremblingly le&s;t he &s;hould be thought an innovator. MONSIGNY, and PHILIDORE, had more &s;pirit, and, catching fire like RAMEAU from the Italian &s;chool, threw that genius into a blaze which only wanted &s;uch a &s;park to illuminate it. From the&s;e, and from their imitators, came all tho&s;e French Minuets, Gavottes, Allemandes, and Jigs, many of which, in the Ballad Operas and Dances, made up the delight of the Engli&s;h from thirty to forty years ago. At length appeared PICCINI, who, though a compo&s;er of great ingenuity, was really an innovator. This man, by &s;trangling melody with accompanyment, fir&s;t taught the Engli&s;h to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;implicity of GALLUPPI, and afterwards went to FRANCE where he &s;tunned his auditors out of the beauty of RAMEAU, MONSIGNY, and PHI|LIDORE; till unfortunately meeting with his coun|terpart in GRETRY, the French, ever capricious, cho&s;e to be &s;urprized rather than delighted, and their mu&s;ical ta&s;te became &s;o vitiated that now they have no mu&s;ical ta&s;te at all.</P>
<P>Without going over the requi&s;ites in which the French &s;uppo&s;e the merits of their actors to con&s;i&s;t, and which had better be con&s;idered upon a com|pari&s;on with the Engli&s;h actors, I &s;hall content my|&s;elf at pre&s;ent with &s;aying that, though they call
<PB N="203" REF="195">
BARON the French ROSCIUS, and &s;peak with rap|ture of many of their performers, yet they never fail in the &s;ame breath to extol GARRICK above all actors ancient and modern.</P>
<P>Indeed little more than declamation could be expected from the repre&s;entations of characters who di&s;cour&s;ed upon their mo&s;t common affairs in rhime. It is notorious that, before <HI>Merope</HI> was performed, tragedy was &s;poken in a manner little &s;hort of re|citative, and acted with almo&s;t the regularity of a minuet. If a character was to be &s;aved from a pre|cipice, he might break his neck and welcome if he had not patience to &s;tay till his pre&s;erver had gone through all the dancing po&s;itions. Rage, grief, love and pity were all &s;poken in the &s;ame cadence, and danced in the &s;ame mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A trait of nature in Madmoi&s;elle DU MESNIL broke the charm. In <HI>Merope</HI> &s;he &s;aw her &s;on in danger and, fancying her&s;elf the character &s;he repre|&s;ented, threw into her face all the agony of a de&s;|pairing mother; and, darting acro&s;s the &s;tage, cried out, in a frenzy of tenderne&s;s and apprehen&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"Barbarian he is my &s;on."</Q> But we &s;hall have lei|&s;ure to &s;peak of their general merits; at pre&s;ent let us talk briefly of them particularly.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="196">From BARON &s;prung, either immediately or col|laterally, many of the be&s;t French actors. He mar|ried Madmoi&s;elle LE NOIR, &s;i&s;ter of THORILLIERE and Madame DANCOURT. His &s;on, who has been already &s;poken of, died young; but he left behind him a &s;on and two daughters, who were all per|formers of merit; the &s;on, in particular, retired with a pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>DANCOURT appears to have been a &s;ound actor, but his great merit lay in training his company, in which he manife&s;ted the &s;tronge&s;t good &s;en&s;e. He read remarkably well, and knew how to teach to others the beauties of tho&s;e authors who&s;e works were confided to his care. He was continually con|&s;idering in what manner he might render the actors re&s;pectable in the eyes of their fellow citizens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LOUIS the fourteenth paid DANCOURT particular attention. He frequently read his pieces to the king in his clo&s;et; and one day as he exerted him&s;elf a good deal, the room being very warm, he felt him&s;elf &s;uddenly ill; on which the king ran in&s;tantly to the window and threw it open to give him air. Another time, having &s;ome &s;uit to prefer to the king, he encountered him as he was coming from high ma&s;s, and, retreating as the king advanced, he nearly tumbled down a &s;tairca&s;e that he had forgot was behind him; at which the king caught him by the arm &s;aying,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I applaud your zeal for your company, and think your demand &s;o rea&s;onable that I &s;hall comply with it, e&s;pecially as you plead their cau&s;e &s;o re|&s;pectfully, but I don't &s;ee why your complai&s;ance &s;hould make you break your neck."</Q>
The pre&s;ident HARLAI did not think DAN|COURT and his company entitled to &s;o much con&s;ideration. When at the head of the troop he went to carry alms for the poor he ac|quitted him&s;elf hand&s;omely of his commi&s;&s;ion and made a brilliant &s;peech. HARLAI was at the head of the Bureau. DANCOURT took the opportunity of enforcing that the charity of the actors ought to exempt them from excommunication, but he was cut &s;hort by HARLAI, <Q REND="inline">"DANCOURT,"</Q> &s;aid the Pre&s;ident,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we have ears to hear you, and hand, to receive your alms, but we have not tongues to an&s;wer you."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="197">In having &s;poken of POISSON as an author it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid giving an outline of him as an actor. His principal merit was in repre&s;enting comic parts, and in particular the part of CRISPIN, and other valets in that &s;tyle. He was very much admired by the court, and LOUIS the fourteenth gave him many proofs of his favour and liberality. POISSON had two &s;ons who performed with &s;ome reputation. One of them left behind him two volumes of plays, &s;ome of which had tolerable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>DUFRESNE was an excellent actor, but he was a curious character. By always &s;ancying him&s;elf the king or the &s;tate&s;man he repre&s;ented, he was mi&s;erable when after pulling off his trappings he could di&s;cover nothing but an actor, born for the contempt of the public, and fated to be excom|municated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pride of DUFRESNE was in&s;ufferable. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am,"</Q> &s;aid he to a friend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"blindly followed, extolled, adored.

 It is &s;aid that in the hands of BEAU|BOURG and others, who &s;ucceeded BARON, the art of acting had degenerated; but that, when DU|FRESNE appeared, be re&s;tored all its excellence with added graces of his own.</P>
<P>We will pa&s;s by among the men LA NOUE; who, though he inherited but few requi&s;ites from nature, was an actor of great general merit; LE GRAND, who, though a good actor, and by no means a bad author, was neither a BARON nor a MOLIERE; MONTMENY, who was merely carre&s;&s;ed as the &s;on of LE SAGE, and QUINAULT, who as well as a good actor, was a pa&s;&s;able mu&s;ician, and many others; and we will hurry over, among the women, the names of JOUVENOT who retired with a pen&s;ion; GAUSSIN, who was the original ZAIRE; LE COUV|REUR, an elegant and accompli&s;hed woman, and an admirable actre&s;s in tragedy; MAUPIN, who was an excellent actre&s;s, who in partiality to her own &s;ex was a perfect SAPPHO; who frequently
<PB N="207" REF="199">
was mi&s;taken for a man, and who &s;ought a duel and &s;et fire to a convent; the three &s;i&s;ters of QUIN|AULT neither of which was de&s;titute of merit; DUCLOS, who was many years celebrated in tra|gedy; DUBOIS, who retired with a pen&s;ion; DAN|GEVILLE, in who&s;e prai&s;e for forty years all the journals, all the hi&s;tories of the theatre, all the dra|matic annals were &s;o lavi&s;h even to the quantity of &s;everal volumes: the&s;e and many more we are con|&s;trained to pa&s;s by that we may take a view, a very tran&s;ient one however, of that celebrated &s;et of actors and actre&s;&s;es who kept up the reputation of the theatre during the reign of VOLTAIRE, and who were upon its e&s;tabli&s;hment in the year 1775.</P>
<P>LE KAIN, who was the dramatic <HI>eleve,</HI> and the intimate friend of VOLTAIRE, had many difficulties to &s;urmount before he &s;tood a chance of &s;ucce&s;s. Both his figure and his voice were again&s;t him; but by a mo&s;t extraordinary and lively &s;en&s;ibility, after a greal deal of art and per&s;everance he overcame all the&s;e natural defects. His acting was like a well painted &s;cene; the touches were mere daubing but the effect was a&s;toni&s;hing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AS LE KAIN has been pre&s;umptuou&s;ly by &s;ome authors con|&s;idered as &s;uperior to GARRICK, probably out of compliment to VOLTAIRE, who con&s;idered him&s;elf as &s;uperior to SHAKESPEAR, I &s;hall have a better opportunity, when I &s;peak of our ROSCIUS, of condemning tho&s;e gentlemen through their own words.</NOTE>.

<P>PREVILLE was certainly an admirable actor through all the round of comedy; and it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, by all the accounts we have of him, that he was the be&s;t the French &s;tage ever knew. It was ever the cu&s;tom to keep a French performer clo&s;e to his <HI>role;</HI> and as we &s;ay, once a captain always a captain, &s;o one might &s;ay of a French actor, once CRISPIN always CRISPIN. But PREVILLE performed every kind of comic part, and always happily. His merit alone was the cau&s;e of their reviving almo&s;t all the comedies of MOLIERE; and to the new characters which were written, whether FREEPORT in <HI>L'Eco&s;&s;ai&s;e,</HI> FIGARO in <HI>Le Barbier De Seville,</HI> MICHAUD in the <HI>Partie de cha&s;&s;e, D'Henry IV.</HI> or any other of the&s;e various cha|racters of which he &s;tampt the reputation, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to deny but that he had as much good &s;en&s;e as ver&s;atility<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am happy to allow this, and &s;hall hereafter allow him much more when in its place, I &s;hall neverthele&s;s &s;hew PREVILLE greatly overmatched by KING.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MOLE performed in hard, hone&s;t, blunt cha+racters

<P>BELLECOUR, who was originally a painter and a &s;cholar of WANLOO, left the bru&s;h for the bu&s;kin. He fir&s;t, however, appeared in tragedy, but his own good &s;en&s;e pointed out the true bent of his talents, and he &s;tood high in reputation in 1775 as a comic actor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;ome &s;imilarity between this actor and BANNISTER, by whom, however, BELLECOUR is infinitely excelled, as will hereafter be &s;hewn.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BRIZARD was an actor of con&s;iderable merit. The advantages of a noble and graceful figure, and a clear and powerful voice, were heightened in him by a &s;u&s;ceptible mind, a &s;trong under&s;tanding, and a cor|rect education. He was born to repre&s;ent the heroes of the great CORNEILLE; and, perhaps, in <HI>The Roman Father,</HI> and indeed all other de&s;criptions of dignified tragedy, no French actor has gone beyond him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">BRIZARD &s;eems to have been a mixture of BOOTH, QUIN, and SHERIDAN.</NOTE>. He enjoyed many years a &s;plendid repu|tation,
<PB N="210" REF="202">
and then retired to a beautiful retreat, where he built him&s;elf an elegant hou&s;e, and filled it with pictures of his own painting.</P>
<P>DUGAZON, an actor of gaiety and addre&s;s, fol|lowed the &s;teps of PREVILLE; running, however, more into caricature. When PREVILLE retired with his wife, which happened at the time the theatre lo&s;t BRIZARD, DUGAZON got on wonderfully; and being named Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>De L'Ecole Royal de De|clamation,</HI> he attained a very high &s;ituation in his profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DUGAZON, though a much more &s;uperficial actor, conveys a &s;trong idea of WOODWARD.</NOTE>.</P>

There was, how|ever, an amiable and benevolent manner in DESES|SARTS that gave great re&s;pectability to tho&s;e kind of characters; and, though his acting was not the prominent feature of the picture, yet it was the happy middle tint without which the picture could have had no prominence at all.</P>
<P>DAUBERVAL, AUGE, BOURET, DALAINVAL,
<PB N="211" REF="203">
and MONVEL, were all actors of re&s;pectability. Having, however, gone beyond my pre&s;cribed bounds, I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent let them pa&s;s by and &s;peak of LA RIVE, an actor of the highe&s;t celebrity, who &s;eized the dramatic crown from the head of LE KAIN. LA RIVE, profiting by the in&s;tructions of the incomparable CLAIRON, and a long attention to the indefatigable labours of LE KAIN, came on the &s;tage at once an accompli&s;hed actor.</P>
<P>Nature that had done but little for LE KAIN, had done every thing for LA RIVE. His figure, voice, manner, were not only correct and engaging, but they were preci&s;ely what tho&s;e requi&s;ites &s;hould be in an actor. They were in them&s;elves intere&s;t|ing, but, under the controul of that mind which ac|tuated them, they were irre&s;i&s;table. LA RIVE with the&s;e advantages gave an added force to the &s;plendor that tragedy had acquired under LE KAIN. LE KAIN, having every thing to acquire, laboured with the in&s;tructions and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of VOLTAIRE, and his own &s;trong mind and excellent under&s;tanding, till he attained perfection almo&s;t in oppo&s;ition to nature; while LA RIVE, in&s;tructed by CLAIRON, &s;tudied and imbibed the perfection of LE KAIN, and tru&s;ted to nature to perform the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the principal French actre&s;&s;es I
<PB N="212" REF="204">
&s;hall begin with Madmoi&s;elle DUMESNIL; for, though VOLTAIRE &s;ays he was charmed with CLAIRON till he &s;aw &s;uperior merit in DUMESNIL, yet it is certain that the latter performed in PARIS in 1737, and that CLAIRON, except in &s;ome few trifling parts which &s;he acted at the Italian theatre, was not celebrated till 1743, the very year when DUMESNIL a&s;toni&s;hed the public by a di&s;play of extraordinary talents in <HI>Merope.</HI> DUMESNIL had a &s;tronger mind and more nature than CLAIRON; CLAIRON more art and management than DUMES|NIL. One declaimed with judgment, the other uttered with feeling. Upon the whole, I know not if the reader can have a better idea of them than by a recollection of Mrs. CRAWFORD and Mrs. YATES, in ALICIA and JANE SHORE.</P>
<P>Madmoi&s;elle RAUCOURT, and Madame VES|TRIS, properly follow DUMESNIL and CLAIRON. The fir&s;t was an impa&s;&s;ioned and enthu&s;ia&s;tic actre&s;s, who is &s;aid to have given to <HI>Medea</HI> and other bold and violent characters a &s;pirit and a warmth that had never before been thrown into them; the other, who was the &s;cholar and intimate friend of CLAIRON, kept clo&s;e to her &s;tyle and manner in which &s;he often equalled and &s;ometimes excelled her. Mad|moi&s;elle HUS was an actre&s;s in a more exten&s;ive &s;tyle, but not &s;o excellent as either of the others.
<PB N="213" REF="205">
She was well received, however, both in tragedy and comedy.</P>
<P>The leading comic actre&s;&s;es were Madame BEL|LECOUR, Madame DUGAZON, and Madmoi&s;elle CONTAT. Madame BELLECOUR continued on the &s;tage a great number of years, and was always re|ceived with the greate&s;t applau&s;e and admiration. The names of PREVILLE and BELLECOUR were in&s;eperable; they con&s;tantly performed in the &s;ame pieces and with the &s;ame reputation. Madame DUGAZON performed incomparably characters of &s;implicity; not that this was her only merit, for parts of more intelligence, where deportment and demeanour were more e&s;&s;ential, and which were di&s;tingui&s;hed by art and cunning, received at her hands every ju&s;tice the mo&s;t &s;anguine author could wi&s;h; and if in PREVILLE and BELLECOUR, there appeared a faint re&s;emblance of KING and ABING|TON; in DUGAZON and his wife might be di&s;cerned a likene&s;s of WOODWARD and ELLIOT.</P>
<P>As for Madmoi&s;elle CONTAT, &s;he performed univer&s;ally in comedy, and undertook the cha|racters that had been per&s;onated by Madame PREVILLE, Mlle DANGEVILLE, and Mlle D'OLIGNY; ju&s;t as Mad.

<P>The regulations of the French theatre were ex|tremely &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Italian theatre. In 1757, the king revoked all former laws and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed new ones more to the intere&s;t and comfort of the performers; who, in the &s;ame manner as the Italians, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the property and divided the profits, after &s;ubmitting to &s;uch ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;oes as were very &s;en&s;ibly and equitably laid down for them.</P>
<P>The&s;e were drawn up entirely upon the &s;ame principle, and carried into effect in the &s;ame manner as the others. The &s;emainiers, trea&s;urers, and all who were entru&s;ted with the regulations, were obliged, as before, to &s;ubmit their conduct to the Intendant <HI>Des Menus,</HI> to be reported for the in|&s;pection of the king, who took them immediately under his patronage. So that to be further par|ticular would be only to repeat what has been &s;een already. In 1775 the company &s;tood thus:</P>

<P>Thus have we taken a view of the French &s;tage from its commencement to the time when it had at|tained the highe&s;t pinnacle of its reputation; from which moment it has ever &s;ince gradually declined. This &s;ubject is equal to a much larger &s;cope and extent than I have been able to afford it, otherwi&s;e I might have been more ju&s;t to a greater number of authors, mu&s;icians, actors and others; who&s;e various merits and reputations de&s;erve a more competent though not a more impartial hi&s;torian.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. CONJECTURES CONCERNING THE DRAMATIC ART IN BRITON BEFORE THE ROMAN CONQUEST.</HEAD>
<P>WITHOUT examining whether this i&s;land ever was a part of the Continent, or by what other means it became peopled, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to concur in a belief that the Britons were originally Gauls. But, if it be allowed only that they had a free com|munication and intercour&s;e with the Gauls, it is abundantly enough to e&s;tabli&s;h a proof that they imported their amu&s;ements as well as their mer|chandize; and, if the Gauls, who were clearly a motley people collected from all nations, adopted the manners, &s;tudies, and plea&s;ures of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans, how is it po&s;&s;ible that the Britons could avoid imbibing the &s;ame propen&s;ities?</P>
<P>It is not pretended that the Druids were originally Briti&s;h; on the contrary they are con&s;idered as an itinerant body who in&s;muated them&s;elves among the Gauls, the Germans, and the Britons, and who, pro|bably,
<PB N="224" REF="215">
came originally, from ASSYRIA and EGYPT, into &s;uch countries as would harbour them; and, as they have been con&s;idered in this part of the world in the &s;ame light with the Gymno&s;ophi&s;ts among the Indians, the Magi among the Per&s;ians, the Chaldeans among the Assyrians, and the Philo&s;ophers among the Greeks, it is very unlikely that the in&s;truction they came to impart was &s;o au&s;tere as entirely to preclude amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Indeed that this was one part of their mi&s;&s;ion there cannot be a doubt. They con&s;i&s;ted of four cla&s;&s;es; prie&s;ts, augurs, in&s;tructors of youth, and poets. Here we have clearly the bards, who &s;ung to their harps the acts and atchievements of heroes, and whe|ther it was among the Britons they fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed this art, or brought it &s;oone&s;t to perfection, it mu&s;t certainly have been in high e&s;teem, for the word bard, if we may rely on a number of authorities, is purely Briti&s;h and derived from bardus, which &s;igni|fies a &s;inger.</P>
<P>We have hi&s;tories of the Welch bards, and the Iri&s;h bards; and if there were only, by way of authority, that a&s;toni&s;hing &s;pecimen of uncultivated genius the poems of OSSIAN, written in the &s;econd or third century, who can deny, the eminent poetic talents of the Scotch bards; and, upon a con&s;ideration of this,
<PB N="225" REF="216">
how naturally will the names of HOMER and HESIOD occur to the mind, &s;ince the Celtic hi&s;tory as well as the Grecian had its foundation in poetry.</P>
<P>But to put it another way. The Druids either travelled for knowledge, or it was brought home to them from its parent countries; and, when &s;o ac|quired, it was incorporated among the pur&s;uits and improvements of the hardy Britons. They knew geography, which not only comprehends a mea&s;ure|ment of the globe it&s;elf, but every one of its com|ponent parts; which originated in CHALDEA, pa&s;&s;ed into EGYPT, improved in PHOENECIA, and grew celebrated in GREECE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SOCRATES, to humble ALCIBIADES, a&s;ked him to trace his territories in ATHENS upon a map.</NOTE>. They practi&s;ed a&s;trology, an art characteri&s;tically Egyptian; the pupils of which art have infe&s;ted the world. Had the Greeks or the Romans hardly a &s;ingle camp where the a&s;tro|logers and the &s;ooth&s;ayers did not act their parts as naturally as the buffoons and the mu&s;icians? Geome|try, which again took root in EGYPT, and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed into GREECE was another of their &s;tudies; and to the&s;e we are authorized to add theology<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The theology of the Druids was that the &s;oul does not die but pa&s;&s;es from one to another. To this, and their natural philo&s;ophy, LUCAN finely alludes, and accounts for their contempt of death in their belief of immortality, which, by the way, he calls an error.</NOTE>, a&s;tronomy, natural philo&s;ophy, and politics.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="217">Are the&s;e the probable &s;tudies of an au&s;tere people &s;hut up in an ob&s;cure nook at a part of the world far di&s;tant from that where the&s;e &s;ciences originated? What u&s;e was the doctrine of &s;urveying coa&s;ts and harbours, dividing and &s;ubdividing the world, or the art of prophecying the fall and ri&s;e of em|pires, or the principles and elements of exten&s;ion, to men who limited their pur&s;uits to the little i&s;land of MONA? No. It will not bear any other con|&s;truction than that the druids, originally wanderers, after combating &s;chi&s;ms in their native countries, &s;et up their re&s;t among other nations, more likely to tolerate their opinions, and venerate their doctrines.</P>
<P>No part of their character, however, concerns the &s;ubject on which our attention is employed, except as it relates to their having been denominated bards, but in that capacity it is as fair to con&s;ider their hymns in their &s;acrifices to JUPITER and MERCURY as perfectly dramatic as the hymns of the ancient Greeks in prai&s;e of BACCHUS, or the Egyptians in honour of ISIS and OSIRIS.</P>
<P>If it be now allowed me that the Druids came
<PB N="227" REF="218">
originally from EGYPT my remark is &s;o came mu&s;ic; &s;o came all tho&s;e arts which have enlighted the world. Drawings, gems, coins, monuments, columns, pyramids retain the forms of in&s;truments invented by the Egyptians; the properties and effects of which, with very little variation, are the &s;ame as many of tho&s;e now in u&s;e among Europeans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forgetting this I &s;uppo&s;e, an author, full of ingenuity and intel|ligence, a&s;ks what is become of the mu&s;ic of the ancients and why it is not as manife&s;t to us as their pyramids, their &s;tatues, and their writings. Unfortunately mu&s;ic is not a dead language; letters are one thing; notation is another. Poems and chronicles, relative to the actions of heroes and legi&s;lators, are intere&s;ting and beget emulation; &s;en&s;ations that relate to ideas may be faithfully tran&s;mitted from language to language by fixed rules and principles; but which way are &s;en&s;ations, to be tran&s;mitted to which no fixed rules can be annexed? Delight undefined, and rapture inexplicable. It can never be forgotten that tho&s;e great writers, who&s;e works are &s;uppo&s;ed to be authenticated to a letter, are perpetually &s;peaking of this very mu&s;ic and all its fa|cination. But the glory was to be re&s;erved for a monk and that cele&s;tial art which was created with order and coeval with light, in&s;tead of in&s;tantly diffu&s;ing univer&s;al plea&s;ure and gladening the &s;miling world, was doomed to remain a chaos, an imperfect lump, for &s;o many thou&s;ands of years, to be awakened into exi&s;tence and &s;haped into &s;ymetry by a droni&s;h prie&s;t in a &s;olitary cloi&s;ter. Many obvious circum&s;tances purely adventitious which have been in&s;tanced, by a variety of authors, will, I am afraid, &s;tigmatize this friar, this father GUIDO, rather as a MARSYAS than crown him as an APOLLO. Put melody out of the que&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on, nature gives us harmony; wit|ne&s;s the bantum cock that in crowing tall a perfect fifth; the hen that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ckling ri&s;es a complete &s;ixth; the cuckoo that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ba&s;s, which the ear is compelled to &s;uppo&s;ed, makes an exact common chord. But how this is extended when we con|&s;ider the properties of foreign birds! Did not the parrot, the minor, and the mocking bird whi&s;tle till father GUIDO, like another ADAM, gave them permi&s;&s;ion? But, after all, what &s;hall be &s;aid of the &s;loth? that, wonderful to relate, to tho&s;e who have not attended to nature, begins at a key note, repeats regularly every note afterwards in a major key till he includes the &s;ixth, and then &s;inks gradually to the key note again, going over the very le&s;&s;on of Sol fa, in the wilds of AMERICA, that mu&s;ical friars, and other modern harmoni&s;ts, teach to young ladies, and other novices, in the courts and cities of EUROPE. Oh that Friar GUIDO &s;hould allow to the &s;loth that which he refu&s;es to the ancients!</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="219">Hi&s;tory, both &s;acred and profane, is full of ac|counts in which mu&s;icians led on troops and ani|mated them to victory; and &s;carcely do we find any of the&s;e in which the ancient Gallic, German, and Briti&s;h Druids are not mentioned; who are &s;aid to have been not only prie&s;ts but mu&s;icians, a part of who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it was to animate their countrymen to the fight. How far back this ob|tained, or to what degree of perfection it arrived, it is not po&s;&s;ible, or if it were, is it material to trace. Certainly the&s;e cu&s;toms exi&s;ted before the Chri&s;tian aera. The Druids had &s;chools where bodies of &s;tudents a&s;&s;embled. In the&s;e &s;chools young men were brought up to learn arts and languages, and, parti|cularly, Greek; and it is remarked that they learnt a great number of ver&s;es by heart. By whom written? Certainly by HOMER, HESIOD, AESCHY|LUS,
<PB N="229" REF="220">
SOPHOCLES, and EURIPIDES. What then did they learn? Dramatic poems; plays, even from HOMER; for I will not concede that the <HI>Iliad</HI> and the <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> are any other than dramatic poems in narrative.</P>
<P>This whole fabric then mu&s;t fall to the ground, or it mu&s;t be allowed that the Druids knew the dra|matic art, or at lea&s;t were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pro|ductions of tho&s;e who did know it, in as high per|fection as any thing it had attained before SHAKES|PEAR. How far they exerci&s;ed it is certainly le&s;t to conjecture. Revolutions annihilate cu&s;toms and obliterate their records.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. FROM THE INVASION OF THE ROMANS TO THE SAXON HEPTARCHY.</HEAD>
<P>AT the time of the Roman inva&s;ion we begin to be more decided. CAESAR, who was him&s;elf a play|wright, hardly invaded BRITAIN without his mimes. His ambition was as much to be con&s;idered in quality of author as conqueror, and we have &s;een him permit ACCIUS to treat him with indifference that he might the ea&s;ier obtain a place in a literary a&s;&s;embly. Nor was this derogatory even to CAESAR. The world at this moment contemplate his writings with more plea&s;ure than his conque&s;ts, though his clemency was equal to his courage.</P>
<P>From the in&s;tant the Britons had an intercour&s;e with the Romans, they imitated them in every thing. The perpetual di&s;putes concerning their tributes during the reigns of CAESAR and AUGUSTUS, oc|ca&s;ioned vi&s;its to ROME, where the &s;ons of the be&s;t families vied with each other in Roman accompli&s;h|ments. With the&s;e they returned and became ob|jects
<PB N="233" REF="224">
of imitation to their countrymen; and, though the Druids &s;trenuou&s;ly interfered, the poi&s;on was imbibed, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s &s;oon took place of &s;implicity and hardihood.</P>
<P>The very mention of the Augu&s;tan age &s;ugge&s;ts an idea of amu&s;ements, and particularly of theatrical amu&s;ements, which that emperor &s;o largely encou|raged. Strangers flocked to ROME to &s;ee tho&s;e &s;tupendous theatres, already de&s;cribed, and to wit|ne&s;s the exhibitions given in them. Britons followed the examples of others; and, though in their con|tinual &s;truggles with the Romans they &s;carcely &s;e|cured them&s;elves a home and a re&s;idence, yet they beguiled their misfortunes naturally enough with the &s;ports and relaxations of their neighbours, and for the performance of the&s;e they are actually &s;aid to have had a theatre.</P>
<P>During the reign of TIBERIUS, at which time they enjoyed more quiet, civilization gained ground; they permitted commercial intercour&s;e to every part of the i&s;land, and they imitated the manners of the Romans as faithfully and as &s;ervilely as we have &s;een the Romans imitate the manners of the Greeks.</P>
<P>In the&s;e times reigned CARACTACUS, the war|like
<PB N="234" REF="225">
like king of the SILURES, GALGACUS, the worthy king of CALEDONIA, and PRASUTAGUS, king of ICENE, over which province his wife, the famous and unfortunate BOADICEA, afterwards became queen. The&s;e and their adherents were now among the few who re&s;i&s;ted the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Ro|mans, and propped the declining reputation of the Druids<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reputation of the Druids began to decline from another circum&s;tance Our SAVIOUR, who was born in the reign of AU|GUSTUS, was crucified about four years before the death of TI|BERIUS. When the di&s;ciples di&s;per&s;ed at the time the Jews were bani&s;hed from ROME, we are told that both St. PETER and St. PAUL came and preached the Go&s;pel in BRITAIN; which, as far as it re|lates to St. PAUL, is confirmed by &s;o many authors that it can &s;carcely be doubted. We have a very particular account of CLAUDIA RUFINA, a Briti&s;h lady, who was married to RUFUS a &s;enator of ROME. This lady was celebrated, particularly by MARTIAL the poet, for correctly under&s;tanding the Greek and Latin languages. He &s;ays in one of his poems that &s;he might have pa&s;&s;ed at ATHENS for a Greek, and at ROME for a Roman. But I particularly mention her here becau&s;e &s;he gave an a&s;ylum to St. PETER and St. PAUL at the time of their pro&s;cription, and it is &s;aid that &s;he was the &s;pecial cau&s;e of St. PAUL's mi&s;&s;ion to BRITAIN; by whom, as &s;he knew the avidity of the Britons for Roman poetry, &s;he &s;ent the ver&s;es of MARTIAL; in con&s;equence of which he &s;ays, in another poem, that <Q REND="inline">"the Britons begin to learn the ver&s;es of the Romans"</Q>; a &s;trong corroboration of many things already here advanced.</NOTE>; but the hardy and warlike &s;pirit of the Britons was no more. The &s;truggle was in vain. The rapacity, the in&s;olence, and the corruption of the Romans had too much vitiated the manners of
<PB N="235" REF="226">
the inexperienced Britons. CARACTACUS, be|trayed by CARTISMANDUA, the lu&s;tful wife of VINUTIUS, king of the BRAGANTES, was led a captive to ROME to grace the triumph of CLAUDIUS; BOADICEA, in the reign of NERO, after &s;u&s;taining with her daughters every po&s;&s;ibly indignity and di&s;|grace, lo&s;t a battle, in which fell eighty thou&s;and of her adherents, and afterwards poi&s;oned her&s;elf<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This very occa&s;ion affords abundant proof that the Britons not only knew the Roman refinements but practi&s;ed them in the fulle&s;t extent. After the injuries that the hou&s;e and followers of PRASU|TAGUS had &s;u&s;tained from the Romans, they are &s;aid to have been in&s;pired from Heaven with hope; for that the image of Victory, at CAMULODUNEM, fell down rever&s;ed without any apparent cau&s;e.

SHAKESPEAR calls the world a wide and univer&s;al theatre; but he, who well knew a figure, could not be perfect without all its limbs, proves his po&s;ition by adding that all the men and women are merely players. But to corroborate this, BOADICEA, in her famous &s;peech at the head of her troops calls NERO, in deri&s;ion, a fidler, and a &s;tage player; which we knew he was. Nay, &s;he attributes the di&s;&s;entions, then in BRITAIN, to their licentious imitation of the vices of the Romans, di&s;&s;eminated by the je&s;ters and buffoons, whom &s;he calls ROME's in&s;truments, and BRITAIN's vipers. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">But for the&s;e,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he,

But, indeed, the whole of this &s;peech is not only full of eloquence but erudition, and plainly &s;hews the knowledge and information of tho&s;e Druids from whom &s;he boa&s;ted her education. Her noble, yet how feminine in her quoting the examples of SYMIRAMIS, of ASSYRIA, NITOCRIS, of BABYLON, TOMYRIS, of SCYTHIA, and CLEOPATRA, of EGYPT, as proofs that it may be nece&s;&s;ary for women to command armies; but what does this prove in her? That &s;he, Briton as &s;he was, at that early period had &s;tored her mind with learning; nay more, that the&s;e matters were under&s;tood by tho&s;e to whom &s;he addre&s;&s;ed them, otherwi&s;e her eloquence would have been u&s;ele&s;s, and her time thrown away. But this is corro|borated in an hundred in&s;tances, one of which is the conduct of CAR|RACTACUS, who, though king of a remote people trained only to arms, a&s;toni&s;hed the Romans, when he was carried captive to ROME, as much by his eloquence as by his fortitude.</NOTE>; and the Druids, who had wholly retired to their i&s;land of MONA, were &s;urrounded and exterminated.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. FROM THE SAXON HEPTARCHY TO THE NORMAN CONQUEST.</HEAD>
<P>AMIDST frequent gleams of certain light, we mu&s;t &s;till wander in the gloom of conjecture; yet, if our enquiries are no more than ingenious, they may entertain even though they &s;hould not convince; and it may be worth while to cheri&s;h probability on a theme in which we intere&s;t our&s;elves, rather than let the whole &s;ink to oblivion and &s;o withhold a clue from other enquirers, who by being better in formed may be more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is whether or not it be of any mo|ment to know if the dramatic art exi&s;ted at all in this country prior to the &s;ixteenth century, before which time it certainly attained no con&s;iderable degree of celebrity; but we are upon a &s;ubject in its nature calculated to excite curio&s;ity, and, I fear, if authors were precluded from exerci&s;ing a little conjectural &s;peculation, ancient hi&s;tory of every &s;ort would be involved in a very inconvenient predicament; its
<PB N="239" REF="230">
whole foundation, &s;andy as it is, being no more than tradition.</P>
<P>From my own part I am willing to believe and I think this inclination rational enough, that the only rea&s;on amu&s;ements and their nature have never been faithfully recorded in this country is becau&s;e no actual government began to be &s;ettled here till ALFRED; and that even his laws and regulations were not permanently carried into effect till king JOHN. The hi&s;tory of this kingdom before the conque&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of nothing more than a &s;eries of conflicting &s;truggles for power and authority, in the commemorating of which the hi&s;torian naturally finds him&s;elf &s;o involved and perplexed, that, had he the pen of HOMER, he could not give it in|genuity enough to de&s;cribe differently the various battles he has to deplore, much le&s;s the different heroes who fell in tho&s;e battles; and, admitting this, what accurate account can we expect of the &s;ub|jects of their relaxations who&s;e occupations were re&s;tle&s;s ambition and de&s;tructive glory.</P>
<P>Amu&s;ements, neverthele&s;s, they mu&s;t have had; it would be childi&s;h to deny it; and it is clearly within probability that, previous to the Roman con|que&s;t, the&s;e amu&s;ements con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch poetry and mu&s;ic as they imbibed from the Greeks, as it
<PB N="240" REF="231">
is evident that after the arrival of JULIUS CAESAR they partook of the dramatic and other &s;ports and &s;pectacles of the Romans.</P>
<P>After the&s;e wanton plunderers had &s;ubdued this country, de&s;poiled it, defaced it, and left no ve&s;tiges of their in&s;atiable lu&s;t of power but the mi&s;eries cau&s;ed by its ravages; they ba&s;ely for&s;ook its de|fencele&s;s inhabitants, now enervated by oppre&s;&s;ion, as a prey to the fir&s;t band of in&s;urgents that might think proper to invade them. The land became a &s;cene of blood-&s;hed and confu&s;ion; till, after a va|riety of &s;anguinary conflicts, it began to lift up its head and flatter it&s;elf with protection under the Saxon heptarchy.</P>
<P>During all this while, however, neither poetry nor its attendant mu&s;ic &s;lept. The only difference was that groves and rece&s;&s;es witne&s;&s;ed tho&s;e numbers, and tho&s;e &s;trains, in terms and &s;ounds of complaint and lamentation, which before, in &s;prightly and triumphant mea&s;ure, had delighted courts and ani|mated armies. Its fire was &s;mouldering among the embers, but not extinct. A remnant of the luck|le&s;s Druids &s;till were &s;cattered up and down, parti|cularly in CALEDONIA. The&s;e required neither records for their poetry nor notation for their mu&s;ic. Tradition &s;upplied the matter and memory gave it utterance.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="232">The&s;e, as the times became le&s;s furious, gra|dually emancipated from their hiding places; and as it had been long cu&s;tomary for every chief to have his bard, for what would have been ACHIL|LES without HOMER, the Saxon kings, in the mid&s;t of their re&s;tle&s;s contentions, by which they at length became united, glad enough to lean to whatever might &s;often the horrors of war and intro|duce, even in the rude&s;t &s;tate, &s;omething like civi|lization, encouraged the&s;e bards to &s;ing tho&s;e ex|ploits they had atchieved, or to invent for them attri|butable atchievements to make them re&s;pected in the eyes of their dependants, or el&s;e to &s;timulate them to great actions, and their dependants to an ad|miration of them, by the &s;tories of kings and heroes which for ages had been handed down by tradition.</P>
<P>Nor were VORTIGERN, and tho&s;e other Britons who after inviting the Saxons became their oppo|nents, more aver&s;e to li&s;ten to the poetry of the bard or the mu&s;ic of the harp. The carou&s;els and all the barbarous &s;ports which made up the <HI>cours plenieres</HI> of the French, immediately after the ex|&s;tinction of the Roman empire, no doubt pervaded BRITAIN; and the Round Table, and the Tourna|ments in the court of ARTHUR, which were exactly the French entremets, give inconte&s;tible proofs of this.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="233">The atcheivements of ARTHUR were &s;ung by the bards, of whom MERLIN is &s;aid to have been the chief;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e &s;ongs were regularly handed down by the bards to one another. It is not que&s;tionable with me whether, in &s;ome of the old ballads in honour of the court of king ARTHUR, we may not have the matter, if not in &s;ome degree the very expre&s;&s;ions, that were uttered in the pre&s;ence of that Prince. All the authors, who write moder|ately, &s;peaking of ARTHUR, give fairly to his fame every traceable part of his prowe&s;s that can be reconciled to rea&s;on, but believe not
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;candalous fables, poetical fictions, and hyperbolical fal&s;e|hoods,"</Q>
attributed to him by fanciful writers. In the &s;ame man|ner all rea&s;onable men, though they cannot con&s;ent to the fables of HOMER, nor to the inventions of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES con|cerning the battle of TROY, do not deny that there were battles at TROY, and that there were many valiant atchievements performed there. It has ever been the cu&s;tom of bards to call in invention whenever the recital of a &s;imple &s;tory was not &s;ufficiently poetical, and, therefore, though we cannot credit all that the Welch bards, who were accu&s;tomed to &s;ing to their harps at fea&s;ts the noble deeds of their ance&s;tors, have &s;aid of ARTHUR; yet, omitting all they have a&s;cribed to his conduct, attributable to &s;upernatural agency, we cannot deny the &s;ub&s;tance of their &s;ong in which they allow his ex|i&s;tence and great prowe&s;s. I &s;hall relate a remarkable though a well known proof that all the &s;ongs of the&s;e bards were not merely le|gendary. The burial place of ARTHUR had been for &s;ix hundred years unknown. When HENRY the &s;econd, and the fir&s;t PLAN|TAGENET, towards the end of his reign, was at PEMBROKE, he was entertained by &s;ome Welch bards who &s;ung the deeds of ARTHUR. In their &s;ongs were &s;ome ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ions that related to his burial, which, upon putting circum&s;tances together, convinced the king and his courtiers, for it mentioned a church-yard in which two pyramids were &s;tanding, that it mu&s;t &s;urely be at GLASTONBURY, in SOMERSETSHIRE. Here they re&s;olved to &s;earch; and, having cau&s;ed the ground to be dug up they &s;ound at the depth of &s;even feet a &s;tone with an in&s;cription which convinced them their &s;earch would not be in vain. They per&s;evered and found ARTHUR and his queen, both of whom were afterwards entombed in GLASTONBURY church, and a cro&s;s of lead, as it was taken off the &s;tone with the in&s;cription, was to be &s;een in the Regi&s;try of that church till the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of that and many other religious places in the reign of HENRY the eighth.</NOTE> and, if we go forward and come to
<PB N="243" REF="234">
ALFRED, we &s;hall not only find him an excellent poet but an accompli&s;hed mu&s;ician; and what won|der in a prince of his rare talents, who had been bred up at the court of ROME at a time when ITALY grew celebrated for poetry and mu&s;ic; more than a hundred years after CHARLEMAGNE had gleaned in that country the materials to found an academy in his own, and only a hundred and about fifteen years before that very GUIDO ARETINE, who is fal&s;ely &s;aid to have invented mu&s;ic, though it mu&s;t be truly acknowledged that he was of very con&s;i|derable advantage to it as far as relates to mea&s;ure and regularity.</P>
<P>But what need to go &s;o forward as ALFRED, or even ARTHUR, to &s;hew when poetry and mu&s;ic were known in BRITAIN? Did not another Prince &s;o early as the third century, &s;ing the wars of the Scotch and the Iri&s;h with all the beauty and maje&s;ty of HOMER? Where can you find among the Greeks
<PB N="244" REF="235">
more picture, more dignity, more pathos, than in the writings of OSSIAN, the &s;on of FINGAL? Are not tho&s;e poems full of matter that relate to times long before they were written? And are they not replete with that Grecian &s;weetne&s;s and &s;ublimity &s;o well known to the Druids, and &s;o well imparted in the education of their Princes? Nay, are they not full of tho&s;e greci&s;ms with which the Druids im|proved the Celtic tongue; and, finally, are not many of them written in dialogue, and, therefore, perfectly dramatic.</P>
<P>As to ARTHUR, the Knights Companions of the Round Table were warriors and poets; &s;o were tho&s;e of RAIMOND BERENGER, in PROVENCE, to whom they have been often compared; and, &s;o com|pletely has it been &s;ettled that the amu&s;ements in BRITAIN and tho&s;e in PROVENCE were exactly the &s;ame, that the only di&s;pute, a matter of no moment to us, has been which has boa&s;ted the pre-eminence; in point of time certainly tho&s;e in BRITAIN, for ARTHUR lived &s;even hundred years before BER|ENGER. I do not effect to deny that the accounts of the provincial poets are full of contradiction and liable to particular objection, but this is rather an e&s;tabli&s;hment of the general fact; for, as we know of the dramatic entertainments of GREECE and ROME, and above all that ROME &s;warmed with
<PB N="245" REF="236">
mimes and actors of mo&s;t extraordinary merit at the time of the di&s;&s;olution of the empire, it is im|po&s;&s;ible but that they &s;pread them&s;elves wherever they could find an a&s;ylum, and that, having an im|mediate intercour&s;e with ENGLAND they vi&s;ited us as well as their neighbours.</P>
<P>From ARTHUR to ALFRED, by which time upwards of three hundred years had elap&s;ed, and the different kingdoms of the Saxon heptarchy were con&s;olidated into one &s;tate, amu&s;ements, except &s;uch as &s;timulated heroes to great actions, of cour&s;e waited on occa&s;ion, and could not be encouraged; but, during tho&s;e intervals when peace gave pau&s;e to the tuba recta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is curious enough to remark that the tuba recta, a kind of double trumpet, is without he&s;itation &s;aid to be the two trumpets of &s;ilver which MOSES was commanded to make in the Wilderne&s;s.

The clergy made mu&s;ic their &s;tudy, and di&s;&s;eminated the knowledge of it among the laity. We have the authorities of HOLLINSHED and BEDE, that they &s;ung in the churches the Grego|rian chant which we have been told by VOLTAIRE was not improved upon in FRANCE till LULLY. The LULLY of KENT at that time was one PUTTA, who was &s;o little an OEPHIUS to ETHELRED, king of the Mercians, when he invaded KENT, that he was obliged to obtain a privilege from the bi&s;hop of MERCIA to go about and teach mu&s;ic to &s;uch as would learn it, and get companions to en|tertain the great for hire. Here we have fairly the troubadours in ENGLAND, and in the &s;eventh century too.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All this will abundantly prove, for it is &s;eriou&s;ly wrong to in&s;tance too much extraneous matter, that ALFRED opened his eyes in a country where mu&s;ic was well known and generally practi&s;ed, and with this plea&s;ant circum&s;tance he &s;eems to have been particularly delighted; for, when he was &s;ent very young to the court of ROME, he omitted no op|portunity
<PB N="247" REF="238">
of improving him&s;elf in more arts than the art of reigning, among which poetry and mu&s;ic &s;eem to have been his favourites; and, though his literary productions con&s;i&s;t of many volumes, yet mu&s;ic was certainly his darling &s;tudy. BALE, SPELMAN, and others, tell us that he mo&s;t indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly encouraged mu&s;ic throughout the kingdom; that he invited mu&s;icians into the country, and par|ticularly one GRIMBALD, of whom the French writers have &s;poken very warmly. This mu&s;ician had been u&s;eful to ALFRED in his way to ROME, and he was treated very honourably at the court of that monarch who&s;e entertainments he regulated.</P>
<P>It cannot now be denied that &s;ome of tho&s;e amu&s;ements mu&s;t have been dramatic, at lea&s;t as much as any of the ma&s;ques and interludes which were written by BEN JONSON, and performed in the court of queen ELIZABETH; for, if they were merely choral what had the harp to do with them? And how could they be any other than works of fancy and variety when the king him&s;elf was the be&s;t harper in the band, as it evidently turned out afterwards when he a&s;&s;umed the form of a common min&s;trel in the Dani&s;h camp, where he mu&s;t have conformed him&s;elf to the per&s;onating every kind of character to avoid detection, &s;ince he remained many days and was obliged to conciliate favour from
<PB N="248" REF="239">
the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t, in the character of a vagabond and a hireling.</P>
<P>From the moment ALFRED &s;at down in pro|found peace and perfect &s;ecurity, he with the mo&s;t indefatigable indu&s;try began to extend civizilation, and to make his name as famous for arts as it had been for arms.

Not only the nece&s;&s;aries but the luxuries of life were now enjoyed by the Britons, for which, voyages were made even to the MEDITERANIAN, and other ports; but nothing &s;atisfied him &s;o much as the cultivation of the politer arts.

In ENGLAND it may have proceeded from indifference, which, however, I &s;hall not caval at; for it is at la&s;t for the public to judge how far the antiquity of the theatre is an object worthy of con&s;ideration. My remarks may be thought futile, and tho&s;e re&s;earches which I may fancy meritorious may be con&s;idered as impertinent and irrelevant. I am in for it, however, and hope to be pardoned if I endeavour to clinch every nail I can. The ob&s;ervation I allude to is, that nobody &s;ince HESTOD has refu&s;ed unequivocally to accord the province of tragedy to MELPOMENE, and of comedy to THALIA. The Mu&s;es were fa|bulous divinities of the heathens, who certainly knew nothing more of them than their &s;tatues created by fancy. Of the&s;e origi|nally there were but three. The&s;e pre&s;ided over meditation, me|mory, and &s;inging, which la&s;t taken in its extended &s;en&s;e means re|cording. At length a &s;culptor, plea&s;ed like PROMETHEUS with his employment, made nine &s;tatues in&s;tead of three, and they were all placed in the Temple of APOLLO. HESIOD gave to them their names and their attributes, on which account, probably, it is &s;aid be was per&s;onally acquainted with the Mu&s;es. This was about three thou&s;and years ago; the fact has never been di&s;puted; and, how|ever, there may have been trifling variations from it, however the provinces of CALLIOPI, CLIO, and URANIA may have been ex|changed or blended together by literary cavil, however POLYHYMNIA may have been &s;ometimes the mu&s;e of mu&s;ic, &s;ometimes of dance, and &s;ometimes of rhetoric, however TERPSICHORE may, according to &s;ome, have pre&s;ided over the harp, and to others over dancing, or, in &s;hort, however different authors may have wre&s;ted authorities to their own purpo&s;es by changing the attributes of tho&s;e mu&s;es it was their ambition to invoke, no one attempt has been made to deprive MEL|POMENE and THALIA of the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion re&s;pectively of tragedy and comedy. This admitted mu&s;t it not have been fa|miliar to every writer &s;ince HESIOD what the dramatic art actually is and was? Nay, before HESIOD; for how could he have given them &s;upremacy over an art that was not in exi&s;tence? We cannot reject this unle&s;s we reject the ancients altogether; and, if we per|mit their heroes to have invoked MARS and BELLONA, that great actions might be atchieved we mu&s;t permit their poets to have in|voked the mu&s;es that great actions might be recorded; and, as this has never been &s;o effectually done as through the medium of the theatre, can any writer, ancient or modern, have been ignorant of all the requi&s;ites of an art &s;o known, &s;o acknowledged, and &s;o defined. ALFRED knew this art. He knew the truth of every word here written. Will it then be ea&s;ily credited that he did not encourage that remembrancer of &s;ame to which &s;o many heroes had been indebted for the perpetuation of their glory? It cannot be believed; and the only rea&s;on why we are ignorant at this minute of the nature of what the dramatic amu&s;ements then were is the indifference with which all the Engli&s;h chroniclers, as well as tho&s;e who&s;e works have been their &s;ource of intelligence, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5 letters">ed a &s;ubject on which they have &s;el|dom touched, unle&s;s when it has involved &s;ome more important object, and then they have &s;carcely d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">igned to afford it particular notice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="242">After the death of ALFRED, the liberal arts, and of cour&s;e the &s;tage, very &s;oon received a violent check, and tho&s;e improvements, which had been made in every branch of &s;tudy during the la&s;t three years, the only period in the reign of ALFRED that

the kingdom enjoyed profound peace, for want of &s;uch a patron were neglected. EDWARD's quarrels with ETHELWALD engro&s;&s;ed his attention too much to give any object place in his mind but arms. Had ALFRED's &s;econd &s;on, ETHELWARD, who inherited his father's genius for letters, &s;ucceeded him, 'tis very probable the dramatic art might then have been a&s;certained. He, however, whatever his in|clination might be, found it probably very difficult to e&s;tabli&s;h the arts in &s;o turbulent a reign under &s;o turbulent a king; he, therefore, retired and &s;pent a &s;hort life in various &s;tudies, and in particular phi|lo&s;ophy and theology.</P>
<P>ATHELSTAN was a king as little likely to pro|mote the arts as EDWARD. He had foreign and dome&s;tic enemies; and, in &s;pight of all his efforts, licentiou&s;ne&s;s grew to &s;uch an intolerable height that EDMUND, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who thought he &s;hould put a &s;top to it by extending the rigour of the penal laws, was ma&s;&s;acred for his pains by a thief. ED|RED, who was little more than a Regent, and who &s;uffered him&s;elf in the mo&s;t turbulent times to be blindly led by DUNSTAN, by which means the monks ruled the kingdom, and would have turned it into a papal province had he not died, gave al&s;o poor encouragement to the arts. There are, never|thele&s;s, many rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect that during this and
<PB N="253" REF="244">
the preceding reign the my&s;teries, or perhaps miracle-plays, which will be fully de&s;cribed hereafter, origi|nated, or rather were revived, for it is extremely difficult to &s;ay when they originated.</P>
<P>Before DUNSTAN, the monks were &s;ecular prie&s;ts. They had the education of youth and taught in families as well as in &s;chools; and we have always found, that in order to enforce edu|cation, &s;omething in the nature of the&s;e miracle plays was performed, in which there had been per|petually a contention between the prie&s;ts and the lay brothers. It is, therefore, very probable that, when DUNSTAN in the plenitude of his power e&s;tabli&s;hed the benedictine order, and endeavoured to render every thing completely eccle&s;ia&s;tical, the&s;e plays performed by the &s;ecular monks were put down, or rather &s;u&s;pended, in one form or another; for, as many of the&s;e lay brothers did nothing more than become monks under mona&s;tic re&s;triction, it is very unlikely, though the place of action might be altered, that the farce it&s;elf did not go on; e&s;pe|cially as St. DUNSTAN him&s;elf was a very good actor, particularly in pantomime, witne&s;s the un|merciful manner in which he took the devil by the no&s;e.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o difficult to di&s;believe that the pranks
<PB N="254" REF="245">
DUNSTAN played poor EDWY, and the wanton and unmanly indignities which through him were offered to his innocent and lovely queen, could have pa&s;&s;ed without comment; e&s;pecially as in &s;pight of his power he had not yet extirpated the &s;ecular clergy, who were both able and willing, for the &s;ake of de|cency, and in ju&s;tice to their injured king, to ex|po&s;e &s;uch in&s;olence and rapacity; and that they did expo&s;e it by &s;ome means of this kind is not at all improbable, when we know that not more than eighty years afterwards, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its place, a play was introduced in the common &s;ports of the people in deri&s;ion of HARDICANUTE's coronation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Various other curious tricks are related of this holy hypocrite; among the&s;e his miracle by which he wholly got rid of the &s;ecular prie&s;ts is not ami&s;s. After a variety of warm di&s;putes, in which the laiety were &s;ometimes victorious and &s;ometimes the clergy, it was agreed to refer every thing to a &s;olemn inve&s;tigation in a Synod to be held in WILTSHIRE. This Synod being met and the controver&s;y propounded, the parties addre&s;&s;ed each other in a &s;train of the bit|tere&s;t invective; till, as they were on the point of proceeding from words to blows the floor of the room, which was an upper apart|ment, gave way and came to the ground with the greate&s;t violence; in con&s;equence of which many limbs were broken, and &s;ome lives lo&s;t. The po&s;t, however, on which DUNSTAN's chair was placed &s;tood firm, by which means he e&s;caped the fate of the re&s;t. This was con&s;idered as a miracle in favour of the monks, and the &s;ecular clergy of cour&s;e lo&s;t their cau&s;e. He al&s;o played another prank with a po&s;t; which, &s;tarting from its &s;ituation, had very nearly de&s;troyed a whole building. By only, however, making the &s;ign of a cro&s;s upon it with his finger, it returned very quietly to its place, and the building became again &s;ecure. But why &s;hould we wonder that he was &s;o expert at tho&s;e wooden miracles when has very harp would work miracles of it&s;elf; for while it played at his command &s;everal hymns untouched by any human hand, the Virgin MARY conde&s;cendingly came and &s;ung to it. Then for angels, he had them of all de&s;criptions for his familiar acquaintance, and thus by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had it &s;o completely in his power to re&s;i&s;t the devil, that in all manner of &s;hapes he whipt him away with thongs and cords; nay, when he came to him in the form of a woman, he pinched him by the no&s;e with a pair of red hot tongs, that by de&s;|troying his beauty there might be no motive left for temptation.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>ETHELRED, the offspring of ingratitude, pro|fligacy, and murder, &s;poke his origin in all his actions; in con&s;equence of which, di&s;&s;ention, folly, and vice &s;talked through the kingdom, and were no doubt reflected by &s;atire's mirror. Owing to this the Danes grew &s;o powerful that, when ED|MUND IRONSIDE &s;ucceeded to the defence of the kingdom, he had &s;carcely a kingdom to defend.</P>
<P>ETHELRED was another NERO to BRITAIN, He bribed the Danes many times to retire, who al|ways returned in exultation. He permitted continu|ally a Dani&s;h army in the kingdom, and thereby &s;ub|jected it to a thraldom &s;uch as it had experienced in the hands of the Romans at the time of BOADICEA. The &s;ame rapacity, the &s;ame pro&s;ligacy, the &s;ame infamy prevailed. Alarmed, therefore, for the con|&s;equence, and advi&s;ed by EDRICK, with whom he is &s;aid to have &s;hared &s;ome of the money the people gave to bribe the Danes, he cau&s;ed a general ma&s;&s;acre of them throughout the kingdom.</P>

through all treaties, came &s;o powerfully upon him, that he fir&s;t retired to NORMANDY, but returned upon the death of SWEYN, who had occupied the Engli&s;h crown &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>ETHELRED's imbecility, cowardice, and folly, however, had by this time made him an object of dete&s;tation to his &s;ubjects; and he fini&s;hed an in|glorious reign, in the mid&s;t of difficulties, which his &s;on EDMUND vainly &s;truggled with great courage and per&s;everance to di&s;&s;ipate; till, after a &s;ingle combat between EDMUND and CANUTE, which was advi&s;ed by the very EDRICK who had been the para&s;ite of ETHELRED, and who afterwards mur|dered EDMUND to pre&s;ent CANUTE with his head, the kingdom was by agreement divided in two.</P>

I &s;hall, therefore, urge no further proba|bilities of the exi&s;tence of interludes, or other dra|matic amu&s;ements at that time than the proofs which will be pre&s;ently advanced that they were well known at the death of HARDICANUTE.</P>
<P>The reign of CANUTE, which pa&s;&s;ed entirely in reconciling jarring opinions, he at all times em|bracing
<PB N="258" REF="249">
that conduct mo&s;t likely to conciliate the affection of the people, was certainly favourable to amu&s;ements. He built churches, endowed mo|na&s;tries, and appointed revenues for the celebration of ma&s;s. Nay, he made a pilgrimage to ROME, from whence it would have been u&s;ele&s;s to return without &s;omething to in&s;truct and amu&s;e. The&s;e arts, which he u&s;ed to flatter his &s;ubjects were returned with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation; this gave ri&s;e to the well known &s;tory of his reproving the tide in the pre&s;ence of his courtiers. The nation, however, was immer&s;ed in barbari&s;m; and, though he was greatly e&s;teemed for his power and his virtues, he &s;ucceeded but little in poli&s;hing the manners of his people.</P>
<P>HAROLD, whatever improvements CANUTE had been able to make, &s;oon overturned them. As if con&s;cious of a very &s;hort reign, he introduced di&s;&s;i|pation more than enough into it for a long one. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay whether he or his brute of a bro|ther was the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute and contemptible. One lived hated and di&s;pi&s;ed three years, and the other but two. The fir&s;t died a prey to remor&s;e for treachery towards ALFRED, a de&s;cendant of the Saxon kings, and the murder of him and his fol|lowers; and the other expired amid&s;t his bea&s;tly revels through plenitude and drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="250">We have upon this occa&s;ion clearly a proof of the exi&s;tence of plays and interludes; for HARDI|CANUTE was held in &s;uch contempt by his &s;ubjects, that a play was written after his death in deri&s;ion, and it for a long time was annually performed by the title of <HI>Hock Holiday</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e annual &s;ports, of which this play made a part, and which were continued by the Engli&s;h &s;o long that they are not wholly un|known even at this day, have a very early origin. If we trace bull|bateing to its &s;ource, throwing at cocks on Shrove Tue&s;day, or any other of tho&s;e diver&s;ions which have been long &s;anctioned by time, we &s;hall find they all originated from commemorating &s;ome national event. This we are at pre&s;ent &s;peaking of was imitated from the Fugalia; a fea&s;t celebrated among the Romans in memory of the expul&s;ion of the kings, and the aboli&s;hing the monarchical govern|ment, originally in&s;tituted under the title of the Regifugium, and held on the twenty-fourth of February, on account of the Tarquins flying from ROME on that day. There have been many di&s;putes as to whether the&s;e two words mean the &s;ame thing; the meaning of one of them is pretty obvious; but St. AUGUSTINE &s;ays that in a true fugalia all decency and mode&s;ty were bani&s;hed, which clearly &s;hews the two fea&s;ts to be &s;imilar. Certainly the Romans had not more rea&s;on to rejoice at the expul&s;ion of the Tarquins than the Engli&s;h had at the expul&s;ion of the Danes; and the &s;ports on Hock Holi|day, or Hoke-day, which certainly was a &s;olemn fe&s;tival in&s;tituted at the death of HARDICANUTE, when the Engli&s;h were for ever re|lea&s;ed from the wanton in&s;ults and boundle&s;s exactions of him and his countrymen, are a po&s;itive proof that the inhabitants of this country were not ignorant of tho&s;e amu&s;ements which made up upon public occa&s;ions the plea&s;ure of the Romans, among which &s;omething theatrical was always introduced. Hoke-day is known as a law term, and &s;ignifies a certain period which, indeed, was the &s;econd Tue&s;day after Ea&s;ter week, when rent became due. There is &s;ome tenure of this kind by which Magdalan College at OXFORD hold lands in HAMPSHIRE. As to the term hocking, it was no more than this: Before the &s;pectators arrived at the place where this play and the&s;e &s;ports were to be performed they were obliged to pa&s;s a rope extended acro&s;s the road; which, upon their paying money, was let down to give them a &s;afe and an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age. If they re|fu&s;ed to pay, it was kept up to hurt their &s;kins and re&s;i&s;t their coming forward. Hoke-day money, or Hoke-tue&s;day money, all authors agree was a tribute anciently paid the landlord for giving his tenants and his bondmen leave to celebrate Hock-day, or Hoke-day, in me|mory of the expul&s;ion of the Danes.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>WE are now come to a period when it will be le&s;s difficult to a&s;certain the true nature of tho&s;e dramatic entertainments which were performed early in ENGLAND. The turbulent di&s;orders that had &s;o long convul&s;ed the kingdom having been in great mea&s;ure &s;hook off at the conque&s;t, amu&s;ements, which no doubt had been at different intervals al|ternately di&s;continued and renewed, began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a more permanent footing. It al&s;o became more an object to authors to notice them; and, owing to this, we thereabout begin to get cer|tain intelligence that various dramatic pieces were exhibited, and in particular my&s;teries, &s;uch as we have &s;een, though at a much later date, &s;o anxiou&s;ly followed in FRANCE.</P>
<P>The NORMAN conque&s;t was effected in 1066; and, not more than thirty-&s;even years afterwards, the priory of St. BARTHOLOMEW, in Smithfield,
<PB N="263" REF="254">
was erected by a man of the name of RAHERE, who was called the King's Min&s;trel, and who&s;e monument is now to be &s;een in that church in the north &s;ide of the chancel. This man kept a com|pany of fidlers; and, he &s;o in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the good graces of HENRY the fir&s;t early in that reign, that he gained from the king the manor of AIOT, in HERTFORDSHIRE, where, going from one extreme to another, he became religious and was the fir&s;t prior in his own priory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not wonderful that RAHERE &s;hould be a favourite in the court of HENRY, who loved the arts, and who from his genius and li|terary merit obtained the title of Beauclere, or the Scholar. Galantry was the characteri&s;tic of his court; and, &s;o greatly did he befriend toleration, that he was the fir&s;t king who granted the city of LONDON a charter, which laid the foundation of their privileges, and may be con&s;idered as the origin of Engli&s;h freedom.</NOTE></P>
<P>As this priory, which was de&s;troyed by HENRY the eighth, was erected in 1103, and after RAHERE had run his career as a min&s;trel, it cannot be denied that min&s;tre&s;ly had been long well known and in great repute<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Le&s;t the employment of min&s;trel &s;hould be con&s;idered as merely that of a fidler, let it be once for all recollected that we have both French and Latin authorities to the contrary.

It was in this capacity they were received into the pre&s;ence of the great, and it is very &s;triking that they certainly were with both friends and enemies a priviledged people; for, when ALFRED a&s;&s;umed this character in the camp of the Danes, they mu&s;t have known him to be a Saxon, but, being a min&s;trel they gave him an honourable reception; and this fact cannot be got over; for it is not enough to &s;ay that ALFRED, being a highly accompli&s;hed character, might, perhaps, have pa&s;&s;ed for a Danc; becau&s;e a Dani&s;h chief, about &s;ixty years afterwards in the face of this fact of ALFRED's having betrayed the Dani&s;h camp, made u&s;e of the &s;ame &s;tratagem to &s;urprize the camp of the Saxons in the reign of ATHELSTAN. Min&s;tre&s;s, therefore, were certainly an improvement of the mimes and hi&s;trions of the Romans; and their entertainments were the farces that were per|formed in all countries, and as perfectly dramatic as any of the ma&s;ques in the reign of ELIZABETH, or the drolls at BARTHOLOMEW Fair, which place after all might have been RAHERE's &s;cene of action, e&s;pecially as he cho&s;e Smithfield to fini&s;h his career, where, that he might not deviate, he &s;till continued in the character of an actor.</NOTE>. It mu&s;t have taken him &s;ome years
<PB N="264" REF="255">
to have made his fortune; and then that profe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have been pretty well re&s;pected by which a man could hone&s;tly make a fortune at all. But comments will become every moment more unne|ce&s;&s;ary, for we &s;hall &s;oon have facts to bear out our argument.</P>
<P>While RAHERE at the head of his company was making his fortune by the interludes, which his en|tertainments certainly were, the prie&s;ts, who al&s;o, perhaps, wi&s;hed to make fortunes, were very bu&s;y in their attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h the my&s;teries. In the
<PB N="265" REF="256">
eleventh century, and if early in the eleventh cen|tury, before the conque&s;t, GEFFROI, a French monk came over here and was made Abbot of St. ALBANS. This monk, being intru&s;ted with the edu|cation of youth, made his &s;cholars act this kind of tragedies, one of which was called <HI>The Miracles of St. Catherine.</HI></P>
<P>The different accounts of this man, and this fact, agree &s;o perfectly that it will be worth while to dwell on the &s;ubject a little longer. GEFFROI, a Norman by birth, as we are told by French and Engli&s;h authors, was &s;ent over by Abbot RICHARD to undertake the direction of the &s;chool at St. AL|BANS. He arrived too late and went to DUNSTA|BLE, where he taught in the Abbey, and &s;et about performing this miracle play there. He afterwards got into the &s;ituation originally intended for him, and his &s;cholars at St. ALBANS, acted this and, doubtle&s;s, other entertainments of the &s;ame nature, for which purpo&s;e the &s;acri&s;tan lent them copes from the neighbouring Abbey, at St. ALBANS, to dre&s;s their characters.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur L'EXTANT thinks that this was an attempt towards the revival of dramatic entertain|ments all over EUROPE. Nothing can be &s;tronger
<PB N="266" REF="257">
than this. We have &s;een that the prie&s;ts in FRANCE performed &s;acrilgeous farces full of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in|delicacy, and &s;o offen&s;ive again&s;t religion and all de|cency, that CHARLEMAGNE was obliged to &s;up|pre&s;s them in the eighth century. A period more than a hundred years before ALFRED. Does it not appear very fea&s;ible then that they had been known here? Might not ETHELRED, an hone&s;t heathen, have been &s;hocked at the &s;hameful mummery of the chri&s;tian prie&s;ts, and, therefore, have put down PUTTA and his followers? Who certainly under&s;tood the trade of acting, otherwi&s;e they would not have &s;trolled about afterwards as trou|badours.</P>
<P>St. AUSTIN by the &s;ame token might have in|troduced &s;ome irregularities into this kingdom, e&s;|pecially as many of his monks were Italian &s;ingers, a de&s;cription of characters which even to this mo|ment have never been remarkably celebrated for having imported much virtue among us. It mu&s;t be recollected that he came here with extreme re|luctance, the feelings of the Saxon heathens having rather revolted at the Devil's dances performed in the churches, which St. AUSTIN with all his &s;anctity, perhaps, was not able wholly to &s;uppre&s;s; to which &s;uppo&s;ition his having previou&s;ly determined to gain their hearts by tickling their ears rather than ap|pealing
<PB N="267" REF="258">
to their under&s;tandings, lends great pro|bability.</P>
<P>The idea of L'EXTANT, therefore, that GEF|FROI's miracle play, or plays, for it is very unlikely that he performed but one, was a revival of tho&s;e entertainments is very fair. They had been, not only in ENGLAND and in FRANCE but all over EUROPE, at different times, according as they con|formed to decency and morality, or grew into li|centiou&s;ne&s;s, permitted and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Nothing, therefore, can be more probable than that they had undergone an interdiction about the time of the conque&s;t, either for improper conduct, or owing to the troubles of the times, and that GEFFROI, a Norman, came over with the Normans and revived an amu&s;ement which he thought would be welcome to a people who wi&s;hed for a little relaxation after the convul&s;ions the kingdom had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>STEPHEN, who &s;eems never to have had that truncheon out of his hand which was his only weapon of defence when he was dethroned, had virtue enough to have promoted the arts; but, owing to the turbulence of the nobles, who looked with a jealous eye on that freedom which HENRY had granted the people, his efforts at civilization were like a whi&s;per in a tempe&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="259">But this was not the ca&s;e with HENRY the &s;e|cond, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who, being &s;ole monarch of ENGLAND, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of more than a third of FRANCE, did not fail to tran&s;plant here tho&s;e amu&s;e|ments which were then the delight of the Continent. Nor was BECKET any more behind hand with him than WOLSEY with HENRY the eighth, for he pa&s;&s;ed through a variety of profligate plea&s;ures before he wore &s;ackcloth next his &s;kin, and daily wa&s;hed the feet of thirteen beggars.</P>
<P>The unbridled gallantry of HENRY, of which we have many more proofs than that of ROSAMOND, put to death by ELEONOR, who was her&s;elf re|pudiated by her fir&s;t hu&s;band LOUIS the &s;eventh for incontinency, and who was daughter of Count VENTADOUR, a provincial poet, was good food for poetry which he certainly encouraged. Nay, his two &s;ons, RICHARD and GEOFFRY, who&s;e undutiful conduct broke his heart, were both, as we &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;ee, troubadours.</P>
<P>But, to prove that the drama was now not only well known but that it was con&s;idered a &s;ubject of &s;ufficient con&s;equence for celebration, an elaborate work was written early in the reign of HENRY which &s;peaks, not only of interludes performed at the theatre, but of plays upon more holy &s;ub|jects,
<PB N="269" REF="260">
in which were repre&s;ented the miracles wrought by Our SAVIOUR's di&s;ciples, and the fortitude and con&s;tancy of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed martyrs. Now had this author noticed the&s;e matters as a di&s;covery, a thing that was invented or brought into ENGLAND by the Normans, we might have ground to believe that no|thing dramatic, at lea&s;t nothing worth notice, had been known in ENGLAND before. But this is not the ca&s;e. He does not &s;peak of the&s;e matters as novelties but only as a part of tho&s;e amu&s;ements which had been long known and followed.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that this book was publi&s;hed to tell the inhabitants of LONDON, or, indeed, any part of the kingdom, that miracles were then performing, and that they then &s;upplanted interludes would be non|&s;en&s;e. No man needed any &s;uch information. He might mean that the&s;e my&s;teries which at that time continued to be performed had, when they were re|vived, put by the interludes, which was no more than the old quarrel between the prie&s;ts and the laity; but nothing can be more clear than that this work alludes to the interludes of RAHERE, certainly performed during the reign of WILLIAM RUFUS, rigid as his character was, which, when RAHERE retired, were &s;u&s;pended for the miracle plays of GEFFROI.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="261">His words are,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in&s;tead of interludes performed at the the theatre,"</Q>
from which we are obliged to infer that it had been cu&s;tomary to perform inter|ludes, and at a theatre, for, probably, a long time before the conque&s;t, but that at the time he &s;peaks of, tho&s;e interludes gave way to more holy re|pre&s;entations; clearly alluding to RAHERE and GEFFROI.</P>
<P>Of what materials tho&s;e interludes were com|po&s;ed, or on what &s;ort of theatre they were repre|&s;ented, it is not very ea&s;y to determine; nor, in|deed, is it very e&s;&s;ential. The theatre, however, implies &s;ome regular place, &s;ome well known &s;itua|tion, frequented and tolerated; and the amu&s;ements were probably a mixture of tho&s;e performed by the the trouveres and the troubadours in PROVENCE, adopted according to circum&s;tances to the Engli&s;h ta&s;te by tho&s;e min&s;trels who ever &s;ince ALFRED had been encouraged to vi&s;it ENGLAND from ITALY.</P>
<P>At any rate 'tis plain to be &s;een that religion did for ENGLAND what it had done for FRANCE; and, in proportion as WILLIAM aboli&s;hed the trials by ordeal, the camp &s;ights, and all tho&s;e &s;avage practices which had been held in &s;uch veneration by the Saxons, the prie&s;ts took the opportunity of incul|cating
<PB N="271" REF="262">
morality by dramatic repre&s;entations of tho&s;e holy facts, the parade of which has oftener made pro&s;elytes than the doctrine.</P>
<P>This will &s;hew in almo&s;t an indubitable light that tho&s;e arts which ALFRED protected, and, to pro|mulgate which he, like other princes of all times, became a writer and a performer, and which we have traced through almo&s;t the whole of the Saxon heptarchy, obtained here as well as in ITATY and as in FRANCE; and that, fluctuating according to cir|cum&s;tances, they were &s;ometimes &s;acred and &s;ome|times profane.</P>
<P>RICHARD COEUR DE LION &s;ucceeded to HENRY the &s;econd; who, not more than a hundred and twenty years after the conque&s;t, was, as we have &s;een, celebrated in PROVENCE as a poet and a per|former, and &s;o was his brother GEOFFRY. We have a great variety of authorities for this, corro|borated by circum&s;tances which we cannot ea&s;ily doubt; and which, after all, was not wonderful in RICHARD, for it was only taking after his mother's family.</P>
<P>The whole intelligence concerning this bu&s;ine&s;s is clogged with contradiction and ab&s;urdity; but it is, however, univer&s;ally allowed that he re&s;ided in

The&s;e were addre&s;&s;ed to the prince&s;&s;es of the court, and &s;ome of them are now to be found in ancient authors. The authorities for all this re&s;t upon CRESCEMBINI, MATHEW PARIS, RYMER, FA|VINE, BEAUCHAMP, and many others; who, how|ever they may vary in immaterial particulars, all agree upon the general fact<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>An ancient bard, called GUILHEM BRITON, has the following di&s;tich, &s;peaking of RICHARD:

which may be thus tran&s;lated:
<Q><L>Stanzas he invented neat</L>

<P>This tran&s;lation is bad enough certainly; but it helps &s;trongly to corroborate that RICHARD was one of the Provincial poets.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>From FAVINE, we have the intere&s;ting intel|ligence
<PB N="273" REF="264">
of his being relea&s;ed from captivity through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of BLONDEL, who was bred up in his court, and with whom he had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ing &s;ongs in dialogue. This BLONDEL, who was a native of NESLE, and had been from his infancy a trouverre, followed the fortunes of RICHARD; and, when by the treachery of the duke of AUSTRIA he was confined, he &s;ought with every po&s;&s;ible di|ligence for his ma&s;ter, pur&s;uing &s;till his occupation of min&s;trel, in hopes that &s;ome intelligence by good fortune might reach the king through which he might work out his relea&s;e.

half him&s;elf that their intelligence might be mutual. This hint was enough for BLONDEL. He, return|ing privately to ENGLAND, informed the barons where their king was impri&s;oned, who immediately &s;et about, and at length accompli&s;hed, his relea&s;e.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e and other proofs that RICHARD was actually and to the fulle&s;t extent one of the provincial poets, I have a variety of autho|rities that cannot be que&s;tioned. Neverthele&s;s, to &s;hew the fact as &s;trong as po&s;&s;ible, and al&s;o that his poetical propen&s;ity greatly forwarded the dramatic art in ENGLAND, be&s;ides BLONDEL, FOUQUET, and others, that FAIDIT, of whom we have &s;een BEAUCHAMP the panegyri&s;t, and who&s;e works con|tain the rudiments of regular tragedy, which PA|RASOLS afterwaids is &s;aid to have perfected, came to ENGLAND with RICHARD, and it was imme|diately upon this that, not only at the Engli&s;h court but in all families of di&s;tinction, interludes and other performances in the &s;tyle of &s;irventes and ten&s;ons were performed, both by performers hired for the purpo&s;e and by the great them&s;elves; which was &s;o cu&s;tomary, &s;ay BEDE and others, that &s;uch as were not capable of joining were ne|ce&s;&s;itated to retire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FAIDIT was certainly a dramatic writer of con&s;iderable emi|nence. BEAUCHAMP, who, by the way, has in many in&s;tances re|futed the errors of other authors, &s;peaks po&s;itively of the tragedies and comedies of FAIDIT; and does not he&s;itate to &s;ay that he got prodigious &s;ums by them in quality of manager; which wealth, being a great voluptuary, he di&s;&s;ipated as fa&s;t as it came. All this mu&s;t have been when he was very young, for it was in con&s;equence of the difficulties into which he was driven by the&s;e exce&s;&s;es, that he entered into the &s;ervice of RICHARD, and it is very probable, though all authors do not agree in this, that it was before he came to EN|GLAND he &s;tole a nun whom he made his wife, and afterwards ex|hibited her as a &s;inger and an actre&s;s, in which capacities &s;he is &s;aid to have been excellent. She &s;erved him, however, a great many &s;lippery tricks, and, at the death of his patron, he returned to PRO|VENCE, having fir&s;t written a funeral poem in honour of RICHARD. There, it is probable, the friends he acquired being very powerful, he obtained his pardon, for we find him again very celebrated and greatly protected. His comedy called<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>L'Heregia dels Preyers,</HI> pro|cured him the patronage of BONIFACE, Count of MONTFERRAT. He mu&s;t have died about 1230, at between fifty and &s;ixty; for it mu&s;t always be remarked that the dates placed again&s;t the names of the provincial poets are not tho&s;e of their births, but either of their deaths, or the times they were in the highe&s;t reputation.</NOTE>.</P>

RANDLE out of gratitude gave LACEY authority over the fidlers, &s;tageplayers, and &s;hoemakers of CHESTER.

His court was frequented by literary characters of all de&s;criptions. Among the re&s;t came a pilgrim named ROMEO. At this time, owing to his imprudent liberality and profu&s;ion, the affairs of BER|ENGER were &s;o deranged that he had been under the nece&s;&s;ity of mortgaging his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Struck with the extraordinary wit and good &s;en&s;e of ROMEO, who had returned from a vi&s;it to the church of St. JAMES at COMPOSTELLA, he &s;ingled him out as his advi&s;er and confidential friend upon this occa&s;ion. ROMEO undertook, by reducing his expences and getting him out of the hands of u&s;urers, to re&s;tore to his patron, his e&s;tates, and revenues; and, being tru&s;ted with unlimitted power and controul, be even effected more than he had promi&s;ed, for he not only redeemed but improved his friend's affairs. His next project was to marry BERENGER's four daughters, his only i&s;&s;ue, to four kings; which he al&s;o as we have &s;een effected. This has particular relation to the &s;ubject we are now upon, for ROMEO was indefatigable, through the&s;e various and &s;plended connections, to extend not only the influence of BERENGER but the cau&s;e of poetry, of which he was a profe&s;&s;or and an admirer; and thus we account for the prodigious number of provincials invited over to ENGLAND by HENRY the third, who married ELEONOR, the &s;econd daughter. The Count, however, as much a bard as he was, did not &s;eem in this in&s;tance to under&s;tand poetical ju&s;tice, the great per|&s;ons with whom he now became connected, jealous that he &s;hould &s;hew &s;uch extraordinary attention to an utter &s;tranger, rai&s;ed &s;o vio|lent a clamour again&s;t him that they induced BERENGER to call his admini&s;tration to account, a&s;&s;uring him that &s;uch tran&s;actions would tran&s;pire as would induce his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. ROMEO &s;ubmitted to a &s;trict enquiry which triumphantly redounded to his honour. BER|ENGER, a&s;hamed of his conduct, entreated that what had pa&s;&s;ed might be forgotten. <Q REND="inline">"Count,"</Q> &s;aid the pilgrim,

In this re&s;olution he per&s;uted. He departed and left BERENGER in di&s;pair and &s;orrow for having abu&s;ed the true&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted friend he had ever known.

Upon another occa&s;ion he paid as little re&s;pect to the clergy; for, though he had no de&s;ign upon their lives, he had upon the means whereby they lived. When the Pope exonerated them from paying mo&s;t heavy taxes which were levied on them, EDWARD refu&s;ed them his temporal protection, &s;o that they were virtually outlaws, and continually robbed and plun|dered by the pea&s;antry, who had permi&s;&s;ion to com|mit the&s;e outrages with impunity.</P>
<P>Thus neither &s;acred nor profane actors &s;tood much chance of encouragement. Dramatic amu&s;e|ments, however, certainly at intervals went on and particularly tho&s;e which were tolerated by JOHN, and performed by the min&s;trels of CHESTER. The&s;e were played at Whit&s;untide, and the different companies of traders were employed three days in the repre&s;entation of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e dramas were taken from the Old and New Te&s;tament, and were full of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t bu&s;|foonery. Each company had its particular play. <HI>The Creation</HI> was performed by the Drapers;
<PB N="281" REF="272">
<HI>Abraham, Melchi&s;edec, and Lot,</HI> by the Barbers; <HI>The Salutation and Nativity,</HI> by the Wrights; <HI>The Three Kings,</HI> by the Vintners; <HI>The Fall of Lucifer,</HI> by the Tanners; <HI>The Purification,</HI> by the Black&s;miths; <HI>The Deluge,</HI> by the Dyers; <HI>The &s;ending of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> by the Fi&s;hmongers; <HI>Mo&s;es, Balack, and Balaam,</HI> by the Cappers; <HI>The Oblation of the Three Kings,</HI> by the Mercers; <HI>The Shepherds feeding their Flocks by Night,</HI> by the Painters and Glaziers; <HI>The Killing of the Innocents,</HI> by the Gold&s;miths; <HI>The Temptation,</HI> by the Butchers; <HI>Chri&s;t's Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> by the Bowyers, Fletchers and Ironmongers; <HI>Je&s;us and the Lepers,</HI> by the Corve&s;aries; <HI>De&s;cent into Hell,</HI> by the Cooks and Innkeepers; <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> by the Clothiers; <HI>The A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> by the Taylors; <HI>The Blindmen and Lazarus,</HI> by the Glovers; <HI>The Re&s;urrection,</HI> by the Skinners; and <HI>The Day of Judgment,</HI> by the Web&s;ters.</P>
<P>If this were taken literally, we &s;hould &s;ee all the inhabitants of CHESTER in the capacity of actors; but it is more probable that, as CHESTER was a pri|vileged place for the&s;e dramas, the different com|panies employed certain actors to perform &s;uch pieces as were re&s;pectively allotted to them. But the&s;e by no means entirely made up all the dramatic performances of the CHESTER actors, for they had
<PB N="282" REF="273">
interludes upon profane &s;ubjects; and, in particular, &s;everal which related to earl RANDLE, by who&s;e intere&s;t, as we have &s;een, they originally became a privileged company regulated by a king, or manager<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e interludes, in honour of RANDLE, obtained without interruption till RICHARD the &s;econd; but there are writers who &s;trongly contend that the privelege granted by RANDLE was no more than a revival of one which had been given by LEOFRIC, earl of CHESTER, in the time of EDWARD the Confe&s;&s;or; which &s;eems, indeed, to infer that the Whit&s;un plays were performed at that early period; for the grant was for three days during the Fair, and, &s;o devoted were tho&s;e days to &s;port and plea&s;ure that, even if a known thief came there, &s;o he committed no depredation on the &s;pot, he was to be privileged during that time from being apprehended.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If EDWARD, the fir&s;t, gave but little encourage|ment to the arts, his &s;on, unlike his father in every other re&s;pect, was equally unlike him in this; for led about by his favourite GAVESTON, and after|wards by the SPENSERS, he went to the other ex|treme and encouraged every thing that was licen|tious. In this &s;trange, irregular, unquiet, and di&s;|&s;olute reign, however, nothing could be expected to the honour of any human pur&s;uit. Both EN|GLAND and FRANCE, familiar with the horrid &s;laughter committed by the Saracens and Chri&s;tians in the cru&s;ades, and the fanta&s;tic and extravagant manner in which they celebrated their atchieve|ments

on their return, knew not, whether in their plea&s;ures or their cruelties, how to be barbarous enough. The Queen's unbridled pa&s;&s;ion for MOR|TIMER encouraged the profligacy of both; and, after the mutual abandoned plea&s;ures and mercile&s;s butcheries which were fini&s;hed by the king's &s;hock|ing and dete&s;table murder, no wonder if &s;o many loo&s;e and di&s;orderly per&s;ons infe&s;ted the kingdom, that it became nece&s;&s;ary in the following reign to re&s;train all kind of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and in particular the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of actors.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. FROM THE VAGRANT ACT OF EDWARD THE THIRD, TO THE REGULATION OF THEATRES BY QUEEN ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>THE continual &s;truggles between holy and profane theatricals, fluctuating &s;ometimes in favour of the clergy, and &s;ometimes in favour of the laity, ar|rived, at length, to &s;uch a profligate pitch, that, ex|actly as in ROME and in FRANCE, it was thought expedient to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e repre&s;entations altoge|ther; not, however, in the Roman manner by the puni&s;hment of death, nor in the French manner by menacing damnation, but in the true Grecian way by the di&s;cipline of the carts tail; for, early in the reign of EDWARD the third, and about two hundred and fifty years after the conque&s;t, it was ordained by an act of parliament,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a company of men, called vagrants, who had made ma&s;querades throughout the whole city, &s;hould be whipt out of LONDON, becau&s;e they repre&s;ented &s;canda|lous things in little alehou&s;es, and other places where the populace a&s;&s;embled."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="276">The nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;hews inconte&s;tibly that the&s;e &s;candalous doings had long been common, and that, whatever temporary checks they might have received from former kings, they had now got to &s;uch an ungovernable degree of licentiou&s;ne&s;s that it required that &s;erious intervention to &s;top their progre&s;s. The operation of this interdiction was the &s;ame in ENGLAND as in FRANCE. Inter|ludes upon profane &s;ubjects were either performed, by &s;lealth or in private families, upon certain fe&s;ti|vals, at weddings, or other &s;plendid entertainments. The&s;e, we are told, were exhibited
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by ingenious trade&s;men and gentlemens &s;ervants,"</Q>
no doubt hired min&s;trels, and that they were &s;plendid or otherwi&s;e, according to the condition of the per&s;on for who&s;e entertainment they were performed; that they were only permitted, and always tacitly, when they expo&s;ed vice or repre&s;ented noble deeds in former times.</P>
<P>And here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to go a little into the &s;pirit of the literature of tho&s;e times, in order to &s;ee what tho&s;e interludes were. During the long reign of EDWARD the third, gallantry and elegance characterized his court; the Order of the Carter was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the repeated victories again&s;t the French introduced, with their king and his re|tinue, who were pri&s;oners in ENGLAND, every im|provement
<PB N="286" REF="277">
that the French had imbibed from their neighbours, or taught them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The character of EDWARD was to give a poli&s;h to bravery, and to &s;often the rigour of courage with the mildne&s;s of genero&s;ity; and, however, ferocious the Engli&s;h are thought to have been at that time, the &s;ingle trait of that mode&s;t dignity, that noble forbearance, that generous &s;olicitude in EDWARD the Black Prince, when, though young, ambitious, and enterpri&s;ing, he threw off every quality but beneficence in con&s;oling and &s;olacing his pri&s;oner the king of FRANCE, is enough to &s;hew that the Engli&s;h were then capable of that refined honour which has never, to the &s;ame pure, di&s;intere&s;ted, and uncontaminated degree, been the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of any other people.</P>
<P>This &s;truggle, however, between valour and be|nevolence, engro&s;&s;ed the whole attention of the times. The arts and &s;ciences were, therefore, little known. The gallantry of the Engli&s;h was confined to the exerci&s;e of open and manly exploits, without a knowledge of the &s;tratagems of war; and, if it had not been that the &s;avour of &s;ome mi&s;tre&s;s was in|di&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary as a &s;timulus towards a con|que&s;t at a tournament, a politene&s;s and an attention to the fair would have but little marked the conduct
<PB N="287" REF="278">
of the court of EDWARD. Nay, perhaps, that pro|vocation lady SALISBURY's garter would have been but a &s;light inducement to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that order, had it not given an opportunity of reviving ARTHUR's round table<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All this is neither more nor le&s;s than the entremets. The inter|ludes complained of in this reign were relieved by various &s;ports. Exerci&s;es of warlike feats on hor&s;eback with unarmed lances, battles on the water curiou&s;ly performed with &s;hields and lances, fighting of boars and bulls, hunting and hawking. In &s;hort, we trace back to ALFRED &s;o &s;trong a &s;imilitude of this mixture of amu&s;ements, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;eldom exi&s;ted &s;eparately. In &s;ummer, leaping, dancing, &s;houting, wre&s;tling, ca&s;ting the &s;tone, and practi&s;ing the &s;hield. In winter, bull and bear-beating, feats on the ice, or &s;etting the boars together to fight which were intended for brawn. All which &s;ports the maidens accompanied with their timbrels. But there was a &s;port in particular which prevailed greatly about the middle of the thirteenth century, when the entremets were the rage in FRANCE, it was called Running at the Quinten, at which game, exactly as in FRANCE, whoever won was rewarded with a peacock.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This of cour&s;e checked materially the progre&s;s of literature; nor would it probably have been much regarded had not a memorable combination of talents at that time di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves throughout EUROPE. DANTE, who was the pane|gyri&s;t of the mo&s;t celebrated troubadours, and who&s;e writings have a poli&s;h unknown before his time; PETRARCH, the &s;cholar of DANTE, who&s;e poetry,
<PB N="288" REF="279">
thanks to love and LAURA, had an inimitable tender|ne&s;s in it; and BOCCACE, the &s;cholar of PETRARCH, who gave the Italian tongue that &s;weetne&s;s and grace which has ever &s;ince di&s;tingui&s;hed it from all other languages; &s;pread their genius, their fancy, and their elegance, to every people capable of im|bibing them.</P>
<P>ENGLAND of cour&s;e caught their influence, and CHAUCER, who was certainly a better poet than either of the&s;e, and who has been held up by the Engli&s;h in the &s;ame degree of veneration as HOMER was with the Greeks, and VIRGIL with the Romans, was endowed with every &s;u&s;ceptibility to add what|ever he thought requi&s;ite of their refinements to his own admirable talents. But this would be ex|traneous did it not tend to prove &s;omething dra|matic; to do which we have only to in&s;tance the <HI>De|cameron</HI> of BOCCACE, and the <HI>Canterbuty Tales</HI> of CHAUCER, which contain an inexhau&s;tible fund for all that can be done in comedy, and unequivocally &s;erve to &s;hew that the drama was not only always known but always con&s;idered as the be&s;t vehicle for de&s;criptive poetry; becau&s;e the &s;ubjects of the tales in the <HI>Decameron,</HI> or at lea&s;t many of them, are taken from authors of former ages and adopted to the times and manners of the country in which BOC|CACE wrote.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="280">This is again the ca&s;e with CHAUCER; who, though he took &s;ubjects from BOCCACE which BOCCACE had borrowed before, has given us a picture of our own times and manners &s;o clearly that not a &s;ingle character has e&s;caped him; and the various &s;hades and di&s;tinctions of his de&s;criptions are &s;o nice, &s;o critical, and &s;o true to nature, that no poet who&s;e delineations of human life are faith|ful could avoid, though he had never read CHAU|CER, being in &s;ome degree his imitator; and what le&s;&s;on after all do we learn from this but that nature is always the &s;ame, has been always de&s;cribed; and, however affections and pa&s;&s;ions, through the modes of times and manners may vary her operations, yet the motives that regulate the mind are con&s;tant and invariable.</P>
<P>After this it would be folly to &s;ay that CHAUCER could not have written a comedy, or that BOCCACE could not, or that any of tho&s;e more ancient writers could not, who furni&s;hed from writers &s;till more ancient the &s;ource whence they drew their pro|ductions. We have hitherto &s;een that authors have always borrowed of each other, and we &s;hall never &s;ee to the contrary; and, whether the thing it&s;elf be a vehicle in which characters are introduced and contra&s;ted through the medium of narrative, or
<PB N="290" REF="281">
whether tho&s;e characters are per&s;onated, the only di&s;tinction is that both are dramatic, but that only one is dramatized. and, therefore, that either po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es all the requi&s;ites of the dramatic art.</P>
<P>If then every thing dramatic was comprized in the works of CHAUCER, and if LANGELAND's <HI>Vi&s;ions,</HI> a celebrated work, and al&s;o &s;ome writings of GOWER, both cotemporaries of CHAUCER, were in the &s;ame &s;pirit, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that the authors of inter|ludes at that time mu&s;t have availed them&s;elves of &s;uch models, e&s;pecially as tho&s;e authors were &s;o nu|merous, and in point of merit &s;o ob&s;cure; and thus CHAUCER, a courtier, and a great man, GOWER a divine, and LANGELAND a di&s;ciple of WICKLIFF, gave their works that turn which was mo&s;t likely to entertain the great and the erudite, rather than amu&s;e di&s;orderly per&s;ons in little alehou&s;es. But to return.</P>
<P>As the act for the puni&s;hing of vagrants was not in its &s;pirit intended to check any thing that might encourage the growth of morality, for &s;urely no|thing could be wi&s;er than to &s;uppre&s;s &s;candalous things performed in alehou&s;es, the clergy of EN|GLAND, feeling like the clergy of all other coun|tries, that in&s;truction comes more welcome to the mind when it is received through the medium of
<PB N="291" REF="282">
amu&s;ement, prepared a &s;tock of religious tragedies after the model of GEFFROI; which there can be no doubt had continued to be tolerated from the time that the itinerant interludes were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts who were too cunning to incur a whipping, e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;acred dramas exactly as GEFFROI had done his; and, as they were many of them heads of &s;chools, their &s;cholars naturally became their actors, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to blame for they were by this means taught at once religion and elocution.</P>
<P>A petition to king RICHARD the &s;econd, in 1378, from the &s;cholars of St. PAUL's &s;chool, puts this matter out of doubt; for it &s;hews that the re|ligious plays had not only been long performed but that their &s;ucce&s;s and celebrity were &s;o great as to have induced others to attempt the &s;ame &s;pecies of entertainment. The petition prayed his maje&s;ty
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to prohibit a company of unexpert people from repre&s;enting the Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament, to the great prejudice of the &s;aid clergy, who bad been at great charge and expence to repre&s;ent it publicly at Chri&s;tmas."</Q></P>
<P>This, as SHAKESPEAR &s;ays, denotes a &s;oregone conclu&s;ion. It po&s;itively implies that the&s;e clergy,
<PB N="292" REF="283">
by &s;ome means or other had obtained an exclu&s;ive right to perform the&s;e my&s;teries; for upon what other pre&s;ence could they petition the king to pro|hibit the&s;e opponents; and this right of theirs mu&s;t al&s;o have been pretty &s;table, otherwi&s;e &s;uch a per|emtory petition might have &s;haken it. But what are the&s;e per&s;ons they wi&s;h to put down? Why a &s;et of <Q REND="inline">"unexpert people,"</Q> novices, innovators, who had not like the&s;e prie&s;ts been long e&s;tabli&s;hed and celebrated as performers of my&s;teries, or, as they call it, of <Q REND="inline">"the Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament."</Q></P>
<P>Does not this clearly prove that, as this com|pany of holy actors were expert at their profe&s;&s;ion in 1378, the my&s;teries had been regularly performed in ENGLAND at St. PAUL's &s;chool, more, perhaps many more, than twenty years before they were per|formed in FRANCE in the Bourg of St. MAUR, where we fir&s;t hear of them in 1398. Nay, is it not very likely that, in 1378, the&s;e clergy had per|formed as long, with as good &s;ucce&s;s, and were as firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed as the Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion, when as innovators they began to look with a jea|lous eye on the clerks of the Bazoche; for we &s;hall &s;ee that no longer than twelve years after this pe|tition, the&s;e my&s;teries were not only performed at Clerkenwell, but attended by all the nobility and gentry.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="284">The accounts we have of this bu&s;ine&s;s are, that the pari&s;h clerks of LONDON performed the&s;e my&s;teries, fir&s;t at Skinner's Well, and afterwards at Clerkenwell, or Clerk's Well; which place took its name from this circum&s;tance. This, however, taken literally, is a very &s;trange conjecture. The pari&s;h clerks of LONDON, I believe, have never been very celebrated for elocution, and then they are by no means a community. It is, therefore, much more fea&s;ible that the&s;e clerks were lay-bro|thers of the church, &s;uch as minor-canons, who to this day in cathedrals &s;ing them&s;elves into their &s;talls ju&s;t as coun&s;ellors eat their way to the bar.</P>
<P>The&s;e might have called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of gra|duates and choirmen, by which union we have in|&s;tantly a number of performers who&s;e habits of edu|cation give us a better idea of literary merit than, without offence to the pari&s;h clerks, who &s;eem to have been gro&s;sly libelled in this bu&s;ine&s;s, we &s;hould be likely to find in a &s;et of old gentlemen, from whom nothing more could be expected than to &s;ay Amen with a good grace. Nor can any thing impeach the probability of this conjecture, for the de&s;ignation of every clergyman at this moment is clerk from the deacon to the prelate; and, in its extended clerical &s;en&s;e, it implies all chantors.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="285">The&s;e gentlemen, being generally in the vigour of life, were very likely to excite the attention that we are told was actually paid them; for, whatever might have been the opinion of the clergy they &s;o greatly prejudiced at St. PAUL's &s;chool, it turned out at la&s;t that they were &s;o expert as to keep all the dramatic reputation to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The clerks of the Bazoche, which were no other than the lay clergy, and the clerks of Clerkenwell will now appear &s;o uniformly upon the &s;ame foot|ing, that their conduct and its operation were exactly alike. They continued the my&s;teries only till they had carried their point; till, in proportion as the pub|lic ta&s;te became more poli&s;hed, and they grew weary of repre&s;enting miracles from the Old and New Te&s;tament, they introduced the moralities, in which, by per&s;onifying virtues and vices, in&s;tead of &s;aints and martyrs, they in&s;inuated a love of moral and &s;o|cial duty by appealing to the affections of the mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a very &s;ingular coincidence, that, when the clerks of the Bazoche placed them&s;elves under the protection of PHILIP LE BEL, he regulated their community and cho&s;e from among them a head, or director, to whom he gave the title of their king, exactly an&s;wering to our title of king of the min&s;trels.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e moralities were not, however, at times,
<PB N="295" REF="286">
without a mixture of religius circum&s;tances and characters. In &s;hort, they were &s;ometimes wholly religious, &s;ometimes wholly mythological, and &s;ometimes both. Innovations, however, of various kinds were attempted, all which were of cour&s;e imitated throughout the kingdom. At length HAY|WOOD, HENRY the eighth's je&s;ter, and his adherents, like the children of Sans Souci, introduced inter|ludes repre&s;enting the manners of per&s;ons in common life. From the&s;e re&s;ulted &s;omething like regular plays which excited &s;o much curio&s;ity that the whole kingdom &s;warmed with actors, till, at length, after many fruitle&s;s attempts to &s;uppre&s;s them, they were entirely put down by queen ELIZABETH with a view to &s;elect &s;uch parts of this chaos as might form a natural theatrical world.</P>
<P>But to trace the &s;teps that led to this regulation. RICHARD the &s;econd having countenanced the my&s;teries at Clerkenwell, HENRY the fourth, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who had rea&s;on enough to keep the peo|ple in good humour that they might the ea&s;ier forget by what means he came at the crown, permitted this indulgence to the fulle&s;t extent, for he was frequently pre&s;ent at the&s;e exhibitions with the queen and all the nobles of his court, and particularly to witne&s;s a performance which la&s;ted eight days, and which took its &s;tory from the creation of the world.</P>

<P><PB N="296" REF="289">This toleration was, however, of cour&s;e very much abu&s;ed, for the people became &s;o mad after the&s;e my&s;teries that they were pre&s;ently performed all over the kingdom. We hear of theatres upon wheels, exactly like the cart of THESPIS, being drawn about COVENTRY and other places, in which the fairs exhibited &s;cenes, and repre&s;ented pageants upon Corpus-Chri&s;ti day; the &s;tories always from the Old and New Te&s;tament, and compo&s;ed in En|li&s;h rhime.</P>
<P>There is a manu&s;cript in the Cottonian library from which we learn the arguments of forty pa|geants or ge&s;ticulations, repre&s;enting all the hi&s;tories of both the Old and New Te&s;tament, from the creation to St. MATTHIAS the apo&s;tle.

<P>The&s;e various performers were called wa&s;tors,
<PB N="297" REF="290">
ma&s;ter-rimours, min&s;trels, and players of interludes, who had overrun the kingdom and reached even to WALES; and it was enacted that none of the&s;e, nor any other vagabonds, &s;hould be &s;u&s;tained or &s;uffered in the land of WALES or el&s;ewhere, to make com|moiths or gatherings upon the people; by which it may be under&s;tood that they gave notice to all within &s;uch a di&s;trict that they performed for money. Among the appellation, other vagabonds, were, pro|bably, included fencers, bearwards, and mummers; which la&s;t de&s;cription at different times have been known to infe&s;t the kingdom. Their cu&s;tom was to dre&s;s them&s;elves in a grote&s;que manner and to dance, mimic, and &s;hew tricks of legerdemain, all which the Engli&s;h had retained ever &s;ince the mimes of the Romans, for it is remarked that they went about ma&s;qued and di&s;gui&s;ed, and were frequently guilty of many lewd and outrageous di&s;orders.</P>
<P>This interdiction &s;eems to have had &s;ome effect for a time; for we find here, as in FRANCE, when printing was known and books began to multiply, which was in the reign of HENRY the &s;ixth, litera|ture became more refined, and the only deviation from the my&s;teries and moralities, except among &s;uch as cho&s;e to run the ri&s;k of offending again&s;t the law, was a &s;ort of revival of the entrements; for we

<P>Though the forgoing &s;peech is to the la&s;t degree profane and in|decent, I could not refrain from giving it at length to &s;hew what was tolerated in tho&s;e times, not only by the king, but by prie&s;ts and philo&s;ophers; for bi&s;hop Fox had the management of this ex|traordinary &s;pectacle, who, lord BACON tell us, was upon that oc+ca&s;ion a good &s;urveyor of works, and a good ma&s;ter of ceremonies; and BACON him&s;elf &s;ays that

<P><PB N="300" REF="293">Though the&s;e &s;trange faragoes wore very little how|ever
<PB N="301" REF="294">
the re&s;emblance of plays, the interludes, which had been variou&s;ly performed in defiance of the law, gave no mean idea of them; and the&s;e, when HENRY the eighth meditated the demolition of the mona&s;teries, received &s;uch &s;anction and encourage|ment from HEYWOOD; who, being the king's je&s;ter, was permitted to change the face of theatrical amu&s;ements, as gave the my&s;teries, and moralities too, a &s;evere &s;hock, from which they never after|wards recovered.</P>
<P>It is true that in the reign of HENRY the eighth there was an act again&s;t mummers, but it was &s;oon under&s;tood to extend only to &s;uch as wore ma&s;ks; and, as the di&s;po&s;ition of the times was to &s;econd
<PB N="302" REF="295">
every proceeding again&s;t prie&s;ts, this very act &s;erved to check the moralities and encourage the inter|ludes; for the prie&s;ts, or repre&s;enters of moralities, were now called &s;tage players, and it is probable the&s;e performances would have been from that mo|ment totally done away had not an attempt been made to revive them in the reign of queen MARY; who, however, gloomy and &s;uper&s;titious as &s;he was and willing to abet prie&s;ts, did not much encou|rage them; nor, if &s;he had done &s;o, could &s;he have been materially &s;erviceable to them, her reign being &s;o &s;hort.</P>
<P>In the mean time, furni&s;hed with what HEY|WOOD had written and procured, the interludes grew very much upon the public; till <HI>Gammer Gurton's Needle,</HI> written not long after the <HI>Pageant</HI> ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, which, though low, was very nearly a regular comedy, fairly &s;haped the&s;e inter|ludes into plays. But this was not all; for dra|matic writers, who perfectly well knew their art began, upon the fall of the my&s;teries and moralities to appear. HENRY PARKER, &s;on to &s;ir WILLIAM PARKER, is &s;aid to have written &s;everal tragedies and comedies; JOHN HOKER wrote a comedy, called <HI>Pi&s;cator, or the Fi&s;her Caught;</HI> but of the&s;e and others who &s;ucceeded them, I &s;hall hereafter
<PB N="303" REF="296">
give a particular account; in the mean time I &s;hall pur&s;ue the hi&s;tory of the theatre generally.</P>
<P>As the darling wi&s;h of HENRY's heart was to e&s;tabli&s;h the Prote&s;tant religion, no wonder he did every thing in his power to &s;uppre&s;s the influence of the Roman Catholics; and, as he well knew that by &s;triking at their dominion over the minds of the people by means of the&s;e amu&s;ements he &s;hould complete that reform which, perhaps, would not have been entirely effected by pulling down the mo|na&s;teries, he encouraged all &s;uch plays as tended to promote his de&s;igns and interdicted all others; which very plainly appears by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-fourth year of his reign, called an Act of Parliament for promoting true Religion, in which there was a clau&s;e re&s;training all rimours, or players, from &s;ing|ing in &s;ongs, or playing in interludes, any thing that &s;hould contradict the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines.</P>
<P>This &s;truck at the my&s;teries at once; which at all times, by repre&s;enting <HI>The Creator, Our Saviour,</HI> and the <HI>Saints and Martyrs,</HI> had been con&s;idered as profane and bla&s;phemous. The moralities were al&s;o weeded of all that had the &s;ame dangerous tendency, and, therefore, became &s;o fame that the interludes, which were &s;oon formed into tragedies
<PB N="304" REF="297">
and comedies, gave the public a truer ta&s;te for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The only evil to be apprehended from this was the increa&s;e of actors, and the inclination of the public to run after them. It appears evidently that dramatic writers who well knew their profe&s;&s;ion lived at that time and &s;oon after, for among others we are told of EDWARD FERRYS, who was cele|brated in the time of EDWARD the &s;ixth, and <Q REND="inline">"who,"</Q> &s;ays his panegyri&s;t,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was a man of no le&s;s mirth and felicity than JOHN HEYWOOD, but of much more &s;kill and magnificence in his metre; and, therefore, wrote for the mo&s;t part to the &s;tage in tragedy, and &s;ometimes in comedy, or interludes; wherein he gave the king &s;o much good recreation, as he had thereby many good rewards."</Q></P>
<P>The actors now having full opportunity to re|pre&s;ent any thing even upon profane &s;ubjects that was not immoral, exactly as it happened &s;ome time after in FRANCE, became numerous as they became celebrated, and would, perhaps, have e&s;tabli&s;hed the drama upon a firm and permanent footing, had not the gloom thrown over the nation during the &s;hort but &s;anguinary reign of MARY, forced them,
<PB N="305" REF="298">
like &s;o many timid hares to cover, to e&s;cape from tho&s;e inqui&s;itorial blood hounds, who, perhaps, might have thought proper to mi&s;con&s;true their re|pre&s;entations of vice and folly into here&s;y.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner, however, did the Engli&s;h horizon emancipate from that ob&s;curity with which it had been dimmed by the horrid and &s;anguinary bonfires in Smithfield, than all the &s;ocial ble&s;&s;ings that the people had &s;o ardently panted for were &s;ought with double reli&s;h. The reform of HENRY, though meritorious, had been enforced; the reformation of ELIZABETH was voluntary. Never, perhaps, was there &s;uch an epoch in the annals of the world. The whole nation was in &s;miles. Their &s;overeign, born to ble&s;s and protect them, was received as a benediction from heaven. Oppre&s;&s;ion was no more. Moderation was re&s;tored. Learning and the arts acknowledged their congenial &s;oil, and the land in a few years received the poli&s;h of centuries.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH had too much good &s;en&s;e to re&s;train plays. She did not chu&s;e, however, to let them run riot; but &s;till they were checked with a very &s;paring hand, till the licentious u&s;e made of this lenity obliged her &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;et about a reform in
<PB N="306" REF="299">
the theatre as &s;he had done in the church. We are told that plays became the occa&s;ion of much &s;in and evil, that great multitudes of people of both &s;exes, re&s;orted to tho&s;e plays; and that, on account of their being acted on Sundays, and fe&s;tivals, the churches were for&s;aken, and the playhou&s;es thronged.</P>
<P>We are further told that great inns were u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e which had &s;ecret chambers and places, as well as open &s;tages and galleries; that in tho&s;e places maids, and the children of good ci|tizens, were inveigled and allured to &s;ecret and illicit intercour&s;e; that the&s;e players uttered uncha&s;te and unworthy &s;entiments, and were guilty of many other enormities. In &s;hort, after the playhou&s;es were ta|citly permitted, in proce&s;s of time they became little better than brothels. It was, therefore, thought expedient fir&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s plays entirely; but, as it was evident that amu&s;ements of this nature upon a well regulated plan, might be rendered a benefit to &s;ociety in&s;tead of an evil, the lord mayor, &s;ir JAMES HAWES, by the command of the queen, i&s;&s;ued an act of common council to this effect:<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That no play &s;hould be openly enacted within the liberty of the city wherein &s;hould be uttered
<PB N="307" REF="300">
any words, examples, or doings of uncha&s;tity, &s;e|dition, or &s;uch like unfit and uncomely matter, under pain of forfeiture of five pounds for every &s;uch offence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That no inn-keeper, tavern-keeper, or other per&s;on what&s;oever within the &s;aid liberties &s;hould permit &s;uch play to be performed within his hou&s;e, or yard, which &s;hould not fir&s;t be peru&s;ed and al|lowed by the lord mayor and court of aldermen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That no per&s;ons &s;hould be permitted to per|form but &s;uch as were allowed and approved of by the lord mayor and court of aldermen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. All &s;uch per&s;ons to be bound in a penalty to the chamberlain of LONDON.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. No play to be performed on any Sunday, or holiday, under the penalty of five pounds.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. All performers allowed, approved of, and licenced as afore&s;aid, to pay for the u&s;e of the poor in the city ho&s;pitals, &s;uch &s;ums as the lord may or and the court of aldermen &s;hould approve of, or otherwi&s;e lo&s;e their licence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. All &s;ums levied to be applied as above, for
<PB N="308" REF="301">
which, upon refu&s;al, the chamberlain of LONDON might &s;ue in the mayor's court.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e laws, which were made in 1574, were not &s;trictly ob&s;erved; for the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of plays encrea&s;ed, and they were thought dangerous to re|ligion, to the morals of the people, and to the &s;tate. The theatres were &s;o crouded that they were &s;up|po&s;ed to promote infection in times of confluent &s;ickne&s;s, therefore, after much debate upon the &s;ub|ject they were wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Upon a repre&s;entation, however, of the queen's players and the players of noblemen and gentle|men, it was again permitted that they might hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to play at weddings, and other fe&s;tivals; at private hou&s;es, or the lodgings of any nobleman, gentleman or citizen, where no correction of money was to be made from the au|dience, but not in public a&s;&s;emblies; but this to|leration was &s;oon extended again in favour of the queens players; who were, however, to be re|&s;tricted to the laws formerly i&s;&s;ued in the mayoralty of &s;ir JAMES HAWES.</P>
<P>They were, however, forbid to commence their entertainments till the deaths &s;hould be for twenty days together under fifty a week, and they were im|mediately
<PB N="309" REF="302">
to leave off when they &s;hould again amount to more than that number; all which was under an idea as before that the crouds at the the|atres promoted infection. No plays were to be performed on a Sunday, or a holiday till after evening prayer, nor then after dark; nor to con|tinue longer than to give the auditors time to return home before &s;un &s;et, or at lea&s;t before dark; and this indulgence at la&s;t was extended to the queen's players, but no more of them were to enjoy at than tho&s;e who&s;e names were notified in the lord trea|&s;urer's letters to the lord mayor, and the ju&s;tices of MIDDLESEX and SURRY, and even tho&s;e her ma|je&s;ty's players were forbid to divide them&s;elves into different companies; and for breaking any of tho&s;e orders their toleration was to cea&s;e.</P>
<P>But all this was not &s;ufficient to keep them within bounds; for their plays were &s;ometimes &s;o offen&s;ive to virtue and morality, and &s;o full of abu&s;e of dif|ferent per&s;ons that they were now and then &s;topt and prohibited; till, at length, they &s;o completely &s;et the laws at defiance that HART, the mayor, in 1589, complained to the lord trea&s;urer, and by his autho|rity, as there were many companies belonging to noblemen, &s;ent for all the players in town without exception and forbid them to perform till further orders.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="303">The&s;e further orders were, however, very &s;oon i&s;&s;ued, for there were pre&s;ently three e&s;tabli&s;hed theatres, which were known by the names of the Theatre, the Fortune, and the Curtine, where we are told they performed comedies, tragedies, inter|ludes, and hi&s;tories, both true and feigned; and it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that after this la&s;t prohibition they pretty well conformed to the regulations en|joined them, for only eight years afterwards an act pa&s;&s;ed in which are the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That all per&s;ons that be or utter them&s;elves to be procters, procurers, patent gatherers, or collectors for goals, pri&s;ons or ho&s;pitals, or fen|cers, bearwards, common players of interludes or min&s;trels wandering abroad (other than players of interludes belonging to any baron of this realm, or any other honourable per&s;onage of greater degree, to be authorized to play under the hand and &s;eal of &s;uch baron or per&s;onage) all juglers, tinkers, pedlars, and petty chapmen wandering abroad, &amp;c. The&s;e &s;hall be adjudged and deemed rogues, vagabonds, and &s;turdy beg|gars, and puni&s;hed as &s;uch."</Q></P>
<P>I have given the &s;pirit of the whole clau&s;e to &s;hew in what company &s;trolling actors were placed. The exemption in favour of the actors retained by
<PB N="311" REF="304">
barons and higher per&s;ons, clearly went to all tho&s;e who performed in LONDON; and, as we know not of any further prohibition, owing, of cour&s;e, to the very rapid improvement of the &s;tage under that galaxy of merit which appeared about this time to enlighten literature, no wonder it &s;oon attained &s;uch perfection as cla&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h theatre infinitely forwarder than any other in the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. MYSTERIES AND MORALITIES.</HEAD>
<P>BOTH for the &s;ake of hi&s;torical intelligence and to gratify particular curio&s;ity, I &s;hall now look after the my&s;teries, moralities, and interludes, and &s;hew in what way by graduating from religion to mytho|logy, from mythology to allegory, and from alle|gory to nature, they at la&s;t improved into tragedies and comedies.</P>
<P>Having given &s;o particular an account of the nature of the my&s;teries and moralities in FRANCE, it will be le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to dwell upon tho&s;e that were performed early in ENGLAND. They may, however, here as there, be di&s;tingui&s;hed into mira|cles, &s;uch as were anathematized in FRANCE by SULLI, and brought forward in ENGLAND by GEFFROI, my&s;teries, which were performed by the Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion, and the boys of St. PAUL's &s;chool, and moralities which were improve|ments
<PB N="313" REF="306">
introduced by the Engli&s;h and French &s;o|ciety of clerks.</P>
<P>For proof of the miracles and that they obtained very early, we have not only <HI>The Miracle of St. Catherine,</HI> by GEFFROI, but accounts of others that were performed in different parts of the kingdom, an&s;wering exactly to RABELAIS's &s;tory of VILLON, who the reader may remember had a curious ad|venture with the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> of POITOU. We are told of <HI>Guary Miracles</HI> which were performed in CORNWALL, and that many people flocked from great di&s;tances to &s;ee them, <Q REND="inline">"for,"</Q> &s;ays the author, who wrote in the reign of ELIZABETH, and was then giving an account of what he con&s;idered as antiquities,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they had therein devils and devices as well to delight the eye as the ear."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e guary miracles, one of which was called <HI>The Creation of the World,</HI> and another <HI>Mount Calverie,</HI> were performed upon the principles of the original Grecian amphitheatre, in temporary build|ings formed in the open fields, the diameter of the inclo&s;ure being generally about fifty feet; and, it is extremely probable, the cu&s;tom being certainly very ancient, this might be the kind of theatre &s;poken of &s;o confidently and in &s;o unqualified a
<PB N="314" REF="307">
manner at the time when, according to BOADICEA, NERO introduced fiddling into BRITAIN.</P>
<P>As to the my&s;teries, the very titles of them prove that they came from the &s;ame &s;ource whence our neighbours derived theirs. <HI>The Po&s;&s;ion of Our Saviour,</HI> which the French confe&s;s to have been written &s;o early that they know not with whom it originated; <HI>The Conception, The Incarnation,</HI> and others, to a very large number, &s;hew &s;ufficiently we were not behind hand in the&s;e religious farces. There are a great many of them extant, &s;ome few of which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to touch upon; but, as it would clog up the narrative to &s;eek for tho&s;e of which we cannot po&s;&s;ibly know any thing except by conjecture, it will be better at once to come to &s;uch as have been acknowledged by well known authors, but who after all appear to have drawn them from a very remote &s;ource.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e authors one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable is BALE. He was born in 1495, in SUFFOLK, and at twelve years old went to the mona&s;tery of Carmelites at NORWICH. He afterwards &s;tudied at Hulme Ab|bey in NORTHUMBERLAND. and was from thence removed to CAMBRIDGE. He became a Prote&s;tant, and was in con&s;equence per&s;ecuted by the Roman Catholics, but he was protected by lord CROMWELL.
<PB N="315" REF="308">
However, on that nobleman's death, he took &s;helter in HOLLAND, where he wrote, or probably tran&s;|lated, mo&s;t of his dramatic productions. He was re|called in the reign of EDWARD the &s;ixth, and given the living of BISHOP's STOKE, in HAMPSHIRE. He was afterwards named to the See of OSSORY, where he &s;trenuou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf to reform his prie&s;ts and aboli&s;h ma&s;s; in con&s;equence of which &s;ome of his &s;ervants were murdered, and his own death was plotted. He, therefore, made his e&s;cape in a &s;mall boat and was taken by the captain of a Dutch man of war, who &s;tript him of all his money and ef|fects. From HOLLAND he retired to SWITZER|LAND, where he continued during the reign of queen MARY. When ELIZABETH came to the throne, he returned to ENGLAND, but could never be prevailed upon to return to his &s;ee, but preferred rather being a prebend of CANTERBURY, where he died in 1563, the year before SHAKESPEAR was born.</P>
<P>BALE wrote &s;eventeen dramatic pieces, of which tho&s;e under are the titles <HI>Of Gods Promi&s;es, The Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, The Temptation, Chri&s;t when he was twelve Years Old, Of the Lord's Supper, Of the Pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, Of the Re&s;urrection, Of Lazarus rai&s;ed from the Dead, Of Simon the Leper,</HI> are my&s;teries; <HI>The Treachery of the Papi&s;ts, The Im|po&s;tures</HI>
<PB N="316" REF="309">
<HI>of Thomas Becket, Again&s;t tho&s;e who adul|terate the Word of God,</HI> and <HI>The Corruptions of the Divine Laws,</HI> are moralities; <HI>Upon both Marriages of the King, Again&s;t Momu&s;es and Zoilu&s;es, Of John of England,</HI> and <HI>The Image of Love,</HI> are plays.</P>
<P>All the&s;e performances, except three of the my&s;teries, are lo&s;t to the world. The&s;e, however, are pretty well pre&s;erved, and, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently in&s;tance in one of them that BALE was a man of &s;ound learning, and by no means for his time a bad poet, we have great rea&s;on to believe that his plays were greatly &s;uperior to that in&s;ufferable non&s;en&s;e <HI>Gammer Gurton's Needle</HI>&mdash;which, by the way, though execrably written, is a perfect play, and not without humour&mdash;or any of tho&s;e other faragoes which the human mind can hardly afford belief, were written only forty years before SHAKESPEAR's productions began to illumine literature.</P>
<P>The my&s;tery I allude to is entitled, <HI>A tragedy or interlude manyfe&s;ting the che&s;e promi&s;es of God unto man by all ages in the old lawe, from the fall of Adam to the incarnacyon of Chri&s;t.</HI> This piece holds out a po&s;itive proof that BALE, and therefore, of cour&s;e, other writers of that time, well knew the an|cients, for it is not in five acts, a number which, if we are well informed, the ancients never u&s;ed but

&s;even acts in which their pieces were often written; and to make the &s;imilitude more perfect, each act fini&s;hes with a chorus performed as the choru&s;es of the ancients were by voices and in&s;truments; the aggregate length al&s;o as well as the proportion of the different divi&s;ions is exactly managed upon the Greek model, for their tragedies in &s;even acts do not contain more matter than is generally found in three acts of any Engli&s;h tragedy. The <HI>Oedipus Tyrannus</HI> of SOPHOCLES, which is one of the longe&s;t of antiquity, has not &s;o many lines by two hundred and fifty, including the choru&s;es, as one of our &s;horte&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ARISTOTLE, who &s;tole as judiciou&s;ly as VOLTAIRE, ob&s;erves by way of a di&s;covery in the words of PLATO, by the bye, who would probably have told us with great &s;implicity that the ob&s;ervation had been long an axiom, that an action &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of beginning, mid|dle, and end, and this, no doubt, is certainly true of all literary con|po&s;itions whatever, from an epigram to an epic poem. The ancients, therefore, not becau&s;e it was ARISTOTLE's advice, for many of them wrote before him, in general either divided their plays into three acts or &s;ix; but, as the middle action was &s;ometimes intricate, for from its nature it ought to involve the piece in that perplexity which leaves the &s;pectator in doubt as to how it &s;hall fini&s;h, they took the third, fourth and fifth acts to have a wide field, by which means the fir&s;t and &s;econd were found fully &s;ufficient for the fir&s;t action which opens the plot and excites the &s;pectators curio&s;ity, and the &s;ixth and &s;eventh for relieving him from that plea&s;ant embar+ra&s;&s;ment into which the middle action has worked upon his mind, by a gradual, a happy, and a natural cata&s;trophe.

If any &s;hould doubt this let him ac|concile him&s;elf by reading the operas of METASTASIO.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="311">As to the writing of this piece it is crude enough, but as it is full of tho&s;e beautiful &s;entiments which every where pervade the &s;criptures, and evidently written by a good man and a philo&s;opher, it cannot by any means be con&s;idered as an indifferent per|formance; at the &s;ame time there is &s;omething &s;hock|ing in introducing the Creator threatening ADAM, commanding NOAH. ble&s;&s;ing ABRAHAM, in&s;tructing MOSES, promi&s;ing DAVID, encouraging ISAIAH and &s;anctifying JOHN the Bapti&s;t, and yet the whole forms a complete plot beginning with original &s;in and fini&s;hing with man's redemption.</P>
<P>It is very probable, as I hinted before, that this piece was a tran&s;lation, for I now &s;hall &s;peak of an|other which I have by me as it was originally printed with a preface and dedication, a good deal illu&s;tra|tive of this probable fact that mo&s;t of the ancients tran&s;lated, or imitated from &s;omething &s;till more an|cient.

In his dedication, which is to the king, he &s;peaks of it as coming im|mediately to him from the pen of GROTIUS, and to GROTIUS from APOLLINARIUS and NAZIAN|ZEN, two ancient fathers of the primitive church.

There are hundreds of in&s;tances that when literary compo&s;itions become the property of all mankind, the reputation of authors is &s;acrificed to the profit of the book&s;ellers. Compre&s;&s;ion is become as much the &s;tudy of Paterno&s;ter Row as the theatre, and every nerve is &s;trained to cram the author at one place into a nut&s;hell, and at the other into a pocket volume. The prefaces and dedications of DRYDEN are full of beautiful pro&s;e conveying intere&s;ting and elegant in&s;truction.

<P>As this piece, though much more irregular as to its conduct, is better written than that of BALE, I &s;u&s;pect it to have been of greater antiquity, e&s;pe|cially as this is the &s;ubject which the French are not able to trace to its &s;ource. Thus, to reconcile this apparent &s;oleci&s;m, the plot, which is crude and incongruous, has remained without alteration, and the &s;tyle, by getting into different hands has ac|quired a brighter poli&s;h. The &s;ubject is much better calculated for repre&s;entation than the other, the characters, one excepted, being le&s;s revolting. The choru&s;es, however, which are chiefly performed by Jewi&s;h women, are not managed according to any rule. They are not like tho&s;e before AESCHY|LUS, which contained the main action, nor after when they only relieved the main action. They &s;eem rather what SOPHOCLES introduced, and EU|RIPIDES afterwards altered; for, though they are not primary objects, they certainly were compo&s;ed of characters which had relation to the principal
<PB N="321" REF="314">
intere&s;t of the piece. I mention this to &s;hew that all the&s;e writers had the ancients in view in every thing.</P>
<P>SANDYS, however, &s;o far conformed to the fa&s;hion of the times in which he wrote as to adopt five acts in preference to any other given number; and, if the prodigious length of the &s;peeches did not tire the reader intolerably, and more the &s;pectator, the whole being little more than a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mo|nologues, the hi&s;torical facts attending upon that event and the &s;ituation of the characters, particu|larly of PILATE, who is made to feel as a man while he acts as a governor, would give the piece a con&s;equence and an intere&s;t that might not di&s;grace later and more perfect productions.</P>
<P>We can trace the&s;e my&s;teries to a variety of au|thors, mo&s;t of whom appeared to have tran&s;lated their plays from either the Greek, Latin, Italian, French, or German; but, as the &s;ubject requires to be no farther treated than merely to prove the ex|i&s;tence and antiquity of the&s;e amu&s;ements, I &s;hall be as brief as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>Many more authors might be named, and many more pieces, which, though the authors are un|known, were entered at Stationer's Hall. There is &s;carcely, however, a play but manife&s;ts from &s;ome circum&s;tance or other that it came from &s;ome|thing written antecedent to the time in which it ap|peared; and, as I &s;hall hereafter be able more parti|cularly to a&s;certain the origin of the moralities, and the old tragedies and comedies, and we &s;hall then find from circum&s;tances a full confirmation of this fact, it may not be ami&s;s to take leave of the my|&s;teries by giving a &s;hort &s;pecimen of their language.</P>

<P>From the&s;e &s;pecimens the reader will ea&s;ily form an idea not only of the two writers but of the man|ner in which the&s;e &s;ubjects were generally treated. BALE's my&s;tery, written clearly by a divine, was
<PB N="327" REF="320">
one of that de&s;cription performed by the prie&s;ts. SANDYS gave him&s;elf the latitude of a poet, and, therefore, though his piece is on a &s;acred &s;ubject, the characters &s;uit the laity. This was one &s;hadow of that di&s;tinction by which the my&s;teries gradually changed into moralities, a &s;pecies of entertainment, however, intolerably dull though frequently well written; for, though allegory requires the powers of a poet, example alone enforces the practice of virtue from the &s;tage. A metaphor may convince me through the medium of imaginary characters that clemency is a beautiful virtue, but let me be &s;hewn an actual in&s;tance of it by &s;ome circum&s;tance like the introduction of TITUS, and I in&s;tantly &s;ee not only its beauty but its practicability.</P>
<P>The moralities were generally written to &s;erve &s;ome temporary purpo&s;e. Sometimes they enforced public opinions, as the comedy of <HI>Good Order,</HI> written by SKELTON; &s;ometimes to promote obedience and conformity to the laws like that called <HI>The New Cu&s;tom,</HI> the author not known, written expre&s;sly to vindicate and promote the Re|formation; &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially when they were written for families. they recommended an attention to the ordinary pur&s;uits of life, and illu&s;trated the ad|vantages of &s;ocial duty; of this cla&s;s were <HI>The Di&s;o|bedient Child,</HI> by INGELAND, a very early writer,
<PB N="328" REF="321">
and <HI>Acola&s;tus; or, the Prodigal Son,</HI> by PALSGRAVE. The ground work of which pieces we have &s;een in the early part of the French &s;tage particularly <HI>Aco|la&s;ius,</HI> which came from the celebrated play of RUTEBEUF, from which &s;o many authors have pil|laged, and among them VOLTAIRE. PALSGRAVE, however, who was chaplain to HENRY the eighth, &s;eems to have had a Latin play written by FUL|LONIUS, in his idea and in his &s;tyle he endeavoured to imitate both PLAUTUS and TERENCE.</P>
<P>Others of the&s;e moralities promoted learning, and the principles of education, &s;uch are the nature of the <HI>Four Elements,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by RASTALL, which among other branches of in|&s;truction illu&s;trates many points of natural phi|lo&s;ophy and necromantia, compiled by SKELTON, fir&s;t in Greek, afterwards tran&s;lated into Latin, and then into Engli&s;h, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who might with to learn different languages.</P>
<P>The laudable drift, therefore, of the&s;e per|formances, of which the&s;e may &s;erve as a few proofs, is very apparent, but the world wanted to be amu&s;ed as well as taught, and this led to the introduction of plays; which, being undertaken by &s;cholars per|fectly well acquainted with the ancients, we in&s;tantly ob&s;erve, whatever other requi&s;ites they may want,
<PB N="329" REF="322">
the early comedies and tragedies are a&s;toni&s;hly regular for the time.</P>
<P>But to dwell a little longer upon the moralities. The&s;e &s;trange repre&s;entations were &s;o managed, that, though they con&s;i&s;ted of a great variety of characters, they might be performed by four or five per&s;ons. In one of them called <HI>All for Money,</HI> which was de&s;cribed as
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a moral and pityful comedy plainly repre&s;enting the manners of men and the fa&s;hion of the world,"</Q>
the characters are Theo|logy, Science, Art, Money, Adulation, Godly Ad|monition, Mi&s;chievous Help, Plea&s;ure, Pre&s;&s;ed for Plea&s;ure, Sin, Swift to Sin, Virtue, Humility, Charity, All for Money, Damnation, Satan, Pride, Gluttony, Learning with Money, Learning without Money, Money without Learning, Neither Money nor Learning, Moneyle&s;s, Moneyle&s;s and Friendle&s;s, Nychol, Gregory, Gracele&s;s, Mother Crook, Judas, Dives, William, and the two Wives; but as not more than two of the&s;e characters, or at mo&s;t three, were ever on the &s;tage at once, and when they generally di&s;appeared they were &s;een no more, &s;everal parts were taken by one per&s;on without any injury to the piece.</P>
<P>I have in&s;tanced here one of the late&s;t, on pur|po&s;e

to &s;hew that, as the my&s;teries became partly moralities, &s;o at la&s;t the moralities became partly plays; for Nychol, Gregory, Gracele&s;s, Mother Crook, &amp;c. are not allegorical but real characters. On the contrary in tho&s;e of an earlier date, one of which is called <HI>Every Man,</HI> we find the Creator in company with Death, Fellow&s;hip, Kindred, Know|ledge, Strength, and Beauty. Before this morality we find the following adverti&s;ement:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here begynneth a treaty&s;e how the hye Fa|ther of Heven &s;endeth dethe to &s;omon every creature to come and gyve a counte of theyr lyves in this worlde; and is in maner of a moralle playe."</Q>
But it is extremely difficult to trace the moralities to their &s;ource. RASTALL, a famous typographer from 1500 onward to 1536, when he died, either wrote, revived, or tran&s;lated many of them. All tho&s;e to which no authors' names are affixed, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e are of this de&s;cription. SKELTON, poet lauret to HENRY the eighth, is the earlie&s;t name we can find, who, be&s;ides tho&s;e that have been noticed, wrote <HI>Magnificence,</HI> a goodly interlude and a mery. The <HI>Negroman&s;ir,</HI> printed in 1504, and the comedy of <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>

on Palm Sunday, greatly to their edification no doubt, was the trial of SIMONY, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a female. One of the characters quotes SE|NECA and St. AUSTIN, and tells this lady to offer the Devil a bribe. The Devil, who enters with a large beard, rejects her offer with the utmo&s;t in|dignation, and &s;wears that &s;he &s;hall be fried and roa&s;ted in &s;ulphur with MAHOMET, PONTIUS PI|LATE, the traitor JUDAS, and king HEROD. The la&s;t &s;cene is a view of Hell where the Devil dances with the Necromancer till, after tripping up his heels, he leaves him in a&s;toni&s;hment, and di&s;appears in &s;moke and &s;ulphur.</P>
<P>After SKELTON we have MEDWALL, chaplain to MERTON, cardinal and archbi&s;hop of CANTER|BURY, who wrote a morality called <HI>Nature;</HI> GAS|COIGNE, who tran&s;lated a morality from ARIOSTO, called <HI>Suppo&s;es,</HI> and wrote another called <HI>The Gla&s;&s;e of Government;</HI> WOODS, who produced <HI>The Con|flict of Con&s;cience;</HI> TARLETON, author of <HI>The Seven Deadly Sins;</HI> and others be&s;ides tho&s;e of BALE already mentioned. But there are many publi&s;hed by RASTALL which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been of a very early date indeed; among the&s;e may be reckoned <HI>Gentlyne&s;e and Nobylite, Impacyente Poverte, Manhood and Wi&s;dome, The Marriage of Wit and Science,</HI> and &s;everal others.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="325">Perhaps it may be wrong to dwell &s;o minutely on the &s;ubject of the&s;e repre&s;entations. Many of which were mi&s;erable tra&s;h, and the be&s;t but fanciful and fanta&s;tic rhap&s;odies, calculated, one &s;hould think, more for drolls and puppet-&s;hews than to make up the delight of kings and courts; but, as they &s;erved to in&s;inuate morality under this homely and grote&s;que form, which alone the people were willing to approve, they &s;o far fulfilled the purpo&s;es of the &s;tage, and &s;obered the public mind into that degree of di&s;crimination which taught the Engli&s;h to admire perfection on the theatre &s;ooner than any other nation after the Greeks.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any thing fuller of im|piety than the my&s;teries taken literally; but it mu&s;t be remembered that the o&s;tentateous ceremonies of the church which have pretty well kept pace with them have en&s;ured an attention to the church it&s;elf, which perhaps, would have been vainly enjoined by ad|monition, or compelled by &s;everity. What wonder then the prie&s;ts &s;hould act in concert with the play, ers? It cannot al&s;o be denied that private duty, en|forced by either the per&s;ua&s;ions, or the menaces of a parent, or a preceptor, &s;eldom exhibits any other than a melancholy pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; but, when in&s;truction wears the lovely form and a&s;&s;umes the alluring garb of plea&s;ure, youth is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lattered into

duty, and cheated into virtue. The &s;tern vizor of rigour falls off and the face of rea&s;on appears chear|ful and complacent.</P>
<P>It is on this account, awkward rude, and boori&s;h as they have managed it, I cannot find rea&s;on to doubt that the world at all times, and this of cour&s;e as well as every other country, have adopted &s;ome in&s;inuating mode &s;imilar to this to en&s;ure by mild|ne&s;s an attention to &s;ocial intercour&s;e and mutual intere&s;t which menace could never have effected; and, whether &s;ports, mu&s;ic, dancing, reciting, or &s;inging of poetry, relating hi&s;tories, true or invented, or any others of the&s;e numerous tubs with which human creatures, as well as whales, mu&s;t be amu&s;ed, have at any time prevented depredations, averted in&s;urrections, and &s;ecured the bounds of good fel|low&s;hip, the whole has been &s;tage effect, and, therefore, virtually an encouragement of the dra|matic art.</P>
<P>Will it be in&s;i&s;ted that if there had been no amu&s;ements of that kind which we now call tra|gedies and comedies, the theatre, properly &s;peaking, would have had no exi&s;tence?

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. INTERLUDES AND REMARKS CONCERNING THEM AND THEIR AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>THE term interlude is &s;o indefinite, and has been &s;o variou&s;ly appropriated, that it has at times ap|plied to every &s;pecies of dramatic entertainment both &s;acred and prophane. There can be no doubt but that its fair vernacular &s;en&s;e is &s;ome farce, or other &s;tage performance, introduced between in|tervals at fea&s;ts; therefore, when it came to have a fixed and determinate &s;ignification, it had not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;emblance to what was originally under|&s;tood as interlude.</P>
<P>In companies it has been the cu&s;tom to give a &s;ong and a toa&s;t alternately; nay, in clubs we &s;hall &s;till find telling &s;tories, preaching Quakers &s;ermons, repeating &s;cenes from plays, imitating puppets, dre&s;&s;ing a fi&s;t like an old woman and make it apparently &s;ing a &s;ong in character, and a prodigious number of modes of mumming in this way. The&s;e
<PB N="336" REF="329">
are interludes as far as they go, and fairly give an idea of what were tho&s;e amu&s;ements performed in little alehou&s;es which occa&s;ioned the Vagrant Act of EDWARD the third.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, of the dramatic kind taken in this &s;en&s;e is &s;o ancient as interlude. The tragedies and comedies of the Greeks, as they have been con|&s;idered according to their original &s;en&s;e of religious and pa&s;toral, the Fe&s;cennines of the Romans, the Jornadas of the Spaniards, the Canva&s;&s;es of the Ita|lians, the Sirventes and Ten&s;ons of the French, and the irregular mixture of them all among the En|gli&s;h, were interludes; a term meaning pieces per|formed theatrically to amu&s;e and in&s;truct &s;ometimes large, and &s;ometimes &s;elect companies; nor were they till HEYWOOD, and tho&s;e other authors about his time, con&s;idered in a fixed and di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e &s;ignifying a regular dramatic piece one &s;hadow only from a play; for, as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;teries promulgated re|ligion through the medium of impiety, and the moralities taught &s;ocial duty by the per&s;onification of tho&s;e virtues men ought to imitate, and tho&s;e vices they ought to avoid, the interludes, &s;uch as they were under&s;tood to be at that time, con&s;i&s;ted of characters which really exi&s;ted, who di&s;cour&s;ed on &s;ubjects mo&s;t proper to enforce the duties which prudence, rea&s;on, and even policy recommended.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="330">So far they were dramatic entertainments, but &s;till they were not plays, for the moral was enforced by precept and not by example. A repre&s;entation of characters in real life which were immediately concerned in the intere&s;t of the action that was going forward, which, as they contributed to bring about the ends of ju&s;tice and morality were re|warded, and which, as they thwarted and perverted tho&s;e ends were puni&s;hed, was a &s;pecies of theatrical amu&s;ement, then entirely unknown, though all the e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ites of it had been always the drift of whatever had been brought forward, yet will this militate again&s;t any thing already here a&s;&s;erted, for it is impo&s;&s;ible to contend that becau&s;e an art had not arrived to perfection it had not, therefore, been exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>It may not now be ami&s;s to blend with tho&s;e in|terludes &s;ome particulars concerning the men who wrote them, among whom the name of JOHN HEY|WOOD &s;tands mo&s;t con&s;picuous. He &s;eems to have been a man of great wit and plea&s;antry, and very well calculated to innovate as he did upon the my|&s;teries and moralities; but, his mind being too ex|ten&s;ive, and his genius too volatile to buckle to the trammels of a univer&s;ity education, he neglected to poli&s;h tho&s;e talents which, neverthele&s;s, he was cer|tainly
<PB N="338" REF="331">
endowed with, and, therefore, probably he was not con&s;idered as a per&s;on of &s;ufficient con&s;e|quence to effect a complete reform.</P>
<P>His abilities were, however, held in con&s;iderable re&s;pect, and he became by his plea&s;ant and agreea|ble wit a great favourite with many eminent men of that time, and particularly with &s;ir THOMAS MORE, who delighted in his company, and introduced him to the prince&s;s MARY, through<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir THOMAS MORE, who&s;e extraordinary talents, who&s;e un|&s;haken rectitude, and who&s;e brilliant wit and amiable manners, made him the admiration of the good and wi&s;e, and the envy of the de|ceitful and malignant; who ornamented the &s;tate, dignified the laws, delighted &s;ociety, and gave a poli&s;h to manners; and who &s;uffered death through the ingratitude of a ma&s;ter whom he had too hone&s;tly &s;erved for his own &s;afety. This &s;ir THOMAS MORE was both the patron of HEYWOOD, and the Macaenas of the age he lived in. The &s;tage, however, was his mo&s;t favourite object of protection, for he was him&s;elf an actor, indulged this propen&s;ity very early in life. MORE was educated in the family of Cardinal MERTON, bi&s;hop of CANTERBURY, who&s;e chaplain, MEDWALL, wrote moralities which were a&s;&s;i&s;ted both by the pen and the acting of MORE, we are told that it was his cu&s;tom to mix with the players when he was not pre|viou&s;ly expected; and, let the &s;ubject be what it might, he made out his part extempore in &s;o entertaining a manner that, not only the matter he delivered was the be&s;t in the piece, but as POLLONIUS &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"he was accounted the be&s;t actor."</Q></NOTE> whom he became the je&s;ter and &s;o much the favourite of king HENRY the eighth, that he highly rewarded him &s;ays
<PB N="339" REF="332">
an author, for the mirth and quickne&s;s of his conceits."</P>
<P>HEYWOOD, however, was not a &s;incere ad|herent of HENRY, for he was a bigotted Roman Catholic, and, therefore, in his heart attached him|&s;elf clo&s;ely to the intere&s;t of MARY; to whom, when the Prote&s;tants were burning in Smithfield, he u&s;ed to relate facetious &s;tories, even at the time when &s;he was on her death bed, by way of cha&s;ing the gloom that naturally hung on her guilty mind for having wickedly &s;acrificed &s;o many martyrs; and thus we &s;ee the difference of the reward of a &s;ervile and accommodating &s;ervant and a noble and ho|nourable one. HEYWOOD was carre&s;&s;ed by HENRY for laughing at him in his &s;leeve, and treating him with duplicity, while MORE who&s;e honour nothing could impeach, and who&s;e magnanimity nothing could di&s;may, lo&s;t his head in return for his fidelity.</P>
<P>After cajoling HENRY, crouching to EDWARD, and deifying MARY, HEYWOOD, fancying that the genero&s;ity and hone&s;ty of &s;entiment, revived by ELIZABETH and the Prote&s;tant religion, might de|tect his hypocricy and &s;o procure for him a merited puni&s;hment, thought it prudent to quit the king|dom. He died at MECHLIN, in BRABANT, about
<PB N="340" REF="333">
1565, the year after SHAKESPEAR was born. His pieces, though they were called plays, are all inter|ludes, &s;uch as they have already defined. They here were all of them publi&s;hed in 1533, and are &s;ix in number, be&s;ides two others, called <HI>Pindar of Wake|field.</HI> and <HI>Philotas,</HI> which are attributed to him but not believed to be his.</P>
<P>HEYWOOD's &s;ix plays are, <HI>A Play between Johan the Hu&s;band, Tyb the Wife, and &s;ir Johan the Prie&s;t;</HI> which &s;eems to be taken from one of the Tales of BOCCACE, which is ludicrou&s;ly imiated by LA FONTAINE. <HI>A Mery Play between the Pardoner and the Friar, the Curate and Neighbour Prat. The Play called the Four P's; being a new and a very mery Interlude between a Palmer, a Pardoner, a Poticary. and a Pedlar. A Play of Genteelne&s;s and Nobility. A Play of Love. A Play of the Weather.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e interludes, for &s;o they all are, manife&s;t the character of the man who wrote them. They &s;eem by very &s;ubtle rea&s;oning between certain per&s;onages to try the public opinion, and that under an idea of depicting local and temporary manners, of which CHAUCER's <HI>Canterbury Tales</HI> &s;tand for the outline, and which ever were and ever will be virtually the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="334">PALSGRAVE, who wrote <HI>Acola&s;tus,</HI> was a man of very exten&s;ive knowledge. He flouri&s;hed in the reigns of HENRY the &s;eventh, and HENRY the eighth. He was born in London, and there re|ceived the fir&s;t rudiments of learning. He was afterwards celebrated at CAMBRIDGE for logic and philo&s;ophy; but his own country and his own language did not &s;atisfy his thir&s;t after learning; he, therefore, went to FRANCE, where he became &s;o admired, not only for his general talents but his proficiency in par|tic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">lar in the French tongue, which he gave a purity and an elegance to which the natives of FRANCE had till then been a &s;tranger,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a very &s;ingular fact. PALSGRAVE was the fir&s;t that reduced the French language to grammatical rules. His works which he publi&s;hed in LONDON, called <HI>L'Eclairci&s;&s;ement de la Language Francois,</HI> is a very ingenious and &s;en&s;ible work; &s;o much &s;o, that many ingenious French authors have willingly acknowledged that all the elegance and &s;pirit for which the French tongue is &s;o celebrated, and which has made it &s;o univer&s;al, would never have pervaded their language had they not received a promethean influence from Engli&s;h genius and judgment; and this generally applies to what I &s;hall particularly in&s;i&s;t relative to plays; which certainly would not have come to any perfection &s;o early as they did in FRANCE, had not the Engli&s;h authors, and particularly SHAKESPEAR, given them a merit and a perfection unknown to any nation &s;ince GREECE.</NOTE> but when the treaty of marriage was on foot between LOUIS the twelfth and Prince&s;s MARY, &s;i&s;ter to HENRY the eighth, PALSGRAVE was pitched upon to teach her the French language. LOUIS, however, died very
<PB N="342" REF="335">
&s;oon after his marriage, and PALSGRAVE attended MARY to ENGLAND; where, through her influ|ence, he became &s;o u&s;eful in teaching French to the Engli&s;h nobility, that he obtained good church pre|ferment, and was made one of the chaplains in or|dinary to HENRY the eighth. When PALSGRAVE was born, or at what time he died cannot now be traced; but the hi&s;torical fact of the marriage be|tween LOUIS and MARY, will &s;hew that he was celebrated &s;o early as 1514; and, as he d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d not publi&s;h his ingenious work in the French tongue till the year 1540, he mu&s;t have run a pretty long career of favour and reputation.</P>
<P>HENRY PARKER, lord MORLEY, was born in the reign of HENRY the &s;eventh. He was a vo|luminous author, and is &s;aid to have written perfect tragedies and comedies, taking the ancients for his model; but, as dramatic pieces do not &s;eem to have been forward enough for this, unle&s;s their perfection con&s;i&s;ted only of their con&s;truction and they were neglected for the tra&s;h that, like <HI>Gam|mer Gurlon's Needle</HI> they contained, it is more ra|tional to &s;uppo&s;e that the pieces of this author were interludes.</P>
<P>MORLEY, was a firm adherent of HENRY. He was one of tho&s;e barons who &s;igned the memorable
<PB N="343" REF="336">
letter to CLEMENT the &s;eventh, threatening him with the lo&s;s of his &s;upremacy in ENGLAND unle&s;s he u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to effect the king's divorce. The king did not fail to return this at|tention; for, when MORLEY had a di&s;pute with lord DACRE, of GILLESTAND, for precedence, he &s;o backed his preten&s;ions that, though we are told MORLEY had not right on his &s;ide, tho&s;e preten&s;ions were confirmed by parliament. He is &s;aid to have lived in honour and e&s;teem to a very advanced age, and to have enlightened that time with many works of celebrity.</P>
<P>RADCLIFF wrote both moralities and interludes; and began about 1538, at which time many of the mona&s;teries were de&s;troyed, to grow celebrated for interlude, which, like tho&s;e of HEYWOOD, helped forward that toleration which HENRY had intro|duced. He took the Carmelite's hou&s;e at HITCHIN, in HEREFORDSHIRE, and converted a part of it into a theatre, where his &s;cholars acted Latin and Engli&s;h comedies that they might acquire confi|dence in public &s;peaking. The&s;e pieces, by being written upon the model of the ancients, &s;eem at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, to be nearer to plays than tho&s;e interludes written by HEYWOOD. The piece called <HI>Chaucer's Melebee,</HI> is &s;aid to have been a perfect co|medy. Their tendency, however, being always to
<PB N="344" REF="337">
&s;econd the king's views in his laudable determination to e&s;tabli&s;h the Prote&s;tant religion, RADCLIFF was greatly countenanced and encouraged, and he in con&s;equence lived re&s;pected, and died rich.</P>
<P>SKELTON, who among other interludes wrote <HI>The Negroman&s;ir,</HI> of which we have already &s;een an account, was laureat both at OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE. He was promoted to the rectory of DISS, in NORFOLK; but, having more of the actor in him than the par&s;on, and being calculated rather to write plays than &s;ermons, he made the pulpit a vehicle for the mo&s;t pointed ridicule and &s;evere farca&s;m; but this did not &s;atisfy him. He wrote a prodigious number of ballads again&s;t the hypocricy of the prie&s;ts, and particularly the mendicants, and for the&s;e irregularities he was &s;u&s;pended by NYKKE, bi&s;hop of NORWICH, a rigid man, from exerci&s;ing the duties of the &s;acred function.</P>
<P>This di&s;grace, however, giving him notoriety, became only a &s;pur to his frolick&s;ome pega&s;us, for he vented his ridicule more and with greater &s;ucce&s;s than ever. Scarcely any of the religious e&s;caped him. At length he had cau&s;e to repent his te|merity; for, having &s;everely attacked the dignity of WOLSEY, that powerful and vindictive mini&s;ter de|termined to make him a &s;evere example. SKELTON,
<PB N="345" REF="338">
however, got an intimation of his intentions; and, before the officers of ju&s;tice, who were in pur&s;uit of him, had arrived to &s;eize him, he took refuge in the &s;anctuary of We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, where he was kindly entertained by Abbot ISLIP, with whom he re&s;ided till the day of his death, which happened in 1529.</P>
<P>JOHN BOURCHIER, lord BERNERS, appears to have been a good author, him&s;elf, and a patron of many of the wits of his time. He was de&s;cended from THOMAS, of WOODSTOCK, duke of GLOU|CESTER. He was Knight of the Garter, and Con|&s;table of WINDSOR CASTLE under EDWARD the fourth, and became popular for quelling an in&s;ur|rection in CORNWALL and DEVONSHIRE, which was headed by MICHAEL JOSEPH, a black&s;mith, in 1495, and this recommended him to the favour of HENRY the &s;eventh.</P>
<P>He was a captain of the pioneers at the &s;iege of THEROUENNE, under HENRY the eighth, by whom he was made Chancellor of the Exchequer for life. He was al&s;o Lieutenant of CALAIS and the MARCHES. He was appointed to conduct the Prince&s;s MARY into FRANCE on her marriage, at which time he became acquainted and wrote in con|junction
<PB N="346" REF="339">
with PALSGRAVE, and what was very re|markable he enjoyed the confidence and continued in the favour of HENRY eighteen years. He wrote him&s;elf but one comedy called <HI>Ite in Veneam,</HI> but it was principally owing to his patronage that the &s;tage boa&s;ted the celebrity it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the time of his death, which happened in 1532<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this nobleman, by his marriage with CATHERINE, the daughter of the duke of NORFOLK, is de&s;cended the pre&s;ent lady barone&s;s BERNERS; who&s;e right to that title had long lain in ob|&s;curity, till, at length, it was clearly made out and recovered by PETER NEVE, e&s;q. NORROY.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the re&s;t of the interlude writers, &s;ome of whom al&s;o wrote plays, there is nothing that can be col|lected remarkable enough to merit particular at|tention. WAGER, WAYER, WAPULL, UPTON, WOODS, PEELE, and others were writers of this cla&s;s, and their interludes were generally contro|ver&s;ies concerning the reformation, which it may be ea&s;ily conceived always tended to &s;ome con|clu&s;ion in its favour.</P>
<P>Thus HENRY the eighth, who per&s;ecuted prie&s;ts, encouraged actors; and thus HEYWOOD and SKELTON were cunningly employed to enforce toleration and &s;trip off the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y from WOLSEY and his dependants. This will pre&s;ently
<PB N="347" REF="340">
&s;hew us that plays, properly &s;o called, by partaking more of rational manners, obtained no permanent reputation and decided character till the Prote&s;tant religion cleared away tho&s;e clouds of bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition in which pure nature and fair truth had been &s;hrouded and concealed. Interludes began the work, but it remained for plays to perfect it.</P>

<P>IT is generally believed that <HI>Gammer Gurton's Needle</HI> was the fir&s;t piece, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the requi&s;ites of a play, that was performed in this kingdom. This, however, is a very doubtful conjecture, un|le&s;s it be allowed that it was written many years be|fore it came from the hands of bi&s;hop STILL, who is &s;aid to have produced it when he was Ma&s;ter of Arts at CAMBRIDGE. A piece called <HI>Dyccon the Bedlam,</HI> which was entered at Stationers Hall in 1562, &s;eems to have &s;erved for the ground work of <HI>Gammer Gurton,</HI> and mu&s;t have been originally written many years before, for &s;uch incomprehen|&s;ible non&s;en&s;e could never have been permitted &s;o long after SKELTON, JOHN HEYWOOD, MEDWALL, lord MORLEY, PALSGRAVE, and JASPER HEY|WOOD, produced pieces much better written; the la&s;t of whom tran&s;lated three tragedies from SENECA.</P>
<P>STILL, however, though he &s;eemed extremely
<PB N="349" REF="342">
fond of pre&s;erving as much of the non&s;en&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, knew very well the true con&s;truction of a perfect play; and, though the ridiculous &s;tory he had to deal with was no more than GAMMER GUR|TON's loo&s;ing the needle with which &s;he was mend|ing her hu&s;band's breeches, the coil kept up by this terrible accident, and the intrigues of DICCON, by which they are all &s;et together by the ears, while he gets good fare and is rewarded all the way round; yet all this is truly dramatic as well as the cata&s;tro|phe, gradually relieving their fears by the re|covery of the needle, which is found &s;ticking in the breeches, to the great annoyance of HODGE, who in putting them on feels a painful proof of the fact.</P>
<P>As to the play it&s;elf, I &s;hould conceive it to be a burle&s;que of the Roman dramati&s;ts, and particu|larly of PLAUTUS and TERENCE, for it has all the balderda&s;h of the fir&s;t and the regularity of the la&s;t.

We at this moment have forgot to reli&s;h the admirable humour of the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> even though every man of reading knows &s;omething of the crude yet valuable plays of DRYDEN. How then &s;hall we be able to judge of the merits of a play at &s;uch a di&s;tance of time which we acknowledge to be perfect in requi&s;ites that &s;ome think of an equal value to all the re&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mean nothing more in this than to reconcile the jarring opinions of different authors, &s;ome of whom think nothing valuable that is not ancient, and others that is not modern. It is as ridiculous to value a coin for its ru&s;t as it is to overlook that hi&s;torical intelli|gence it may happen to convey. All extremes are contemptible. Prudent rea&s;oners will think thus: Great and enlightened writers have &s;tarted in all ages and in all nations, and though literary pro|ductions, which, by the bye, are not always works of genius, were not multiplied to &s;uch a degree, or &s;o cut out and con&s;tructed by &s;quare and rule before printing was invented as they have been &s;ince, yet it does not at all imply that letters begat poetry but rather that genius begat letters. What &s;hall we &s;ay to oral tradition which has tran&s;mitted from age to age tho&s;e many &s;ublime and exqui&s;ite ideas, invented, or rather imbibed by poets, who could not read, which modern writers and tho&s;e celebrated for erudition have been obliged to adopt. We know by this that the mea&s;ure of invention was full be|fore the regulations of literature were agreed upon. At the &s;ame time we know that when nature is left to her&s;elf, her productions, however luxuriant, are not &s;o beautiful, nor &s;o vigorous as when &s;kilfully pruned, arranged, innoculated, and grafted; but it mu&s;t, indeed, be with &s;kill that this is attempted, otherwi&s;e de&s;truction would be the con&s;equence in&s;tead of pre&s;ervation; and after all it mu&s;t be re|membered, that, though cultivation may improve nature, without the productions of nature there could be no cultivation at all. Wi&s;e men, therefore, though they laudably encourage every attempt to poli&s;h the beauty and bring out the lu&s;tre of poetry, will always chu&s;e that &s;implicity which brings nature home to the heart, rather than &s;ee it rounded by a period, or dre&s;&s;ed in an idiom.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="344">As to the play in que&s;tion it is worthy of but very little contention, nor is it ea&s;y to be accounted for, why &s;o much notice &s;hould have been taken of it by a variety of authors, or how it met with &s;uc|ce&s;s to the degree which they have a&s;&s;erted, unle&s;s, being in the light of an oppo&s;ition to the interludes, it was con&s;idered as an innovation; a circum&s;tance always eagerly caught at in the theatrical &s;tate.</P>
<P>That there were &s;everal plays before <HI>Gammer Gurton's Needle,</HI> however, admits of very little doubt. We have an account of a tragedy called <HI>Matilda,</HI> which was performed before HENRY the &s;eventh, &s;ixty years at lea&s;t earlier than that comedy.

<P>The comedy of <HI>Pi&s;cator; or the Fi&s;her caught,</HI> written by HOKER, who we are told was a man of fancy and learning, a rhetorician and a poet, al&s;o came much earlier; &s;o did lord MORLEY's trage|dies and comedies, which &s;eem to have been tran|&s;lations from the ancients, and indeed many more; &s;ome of which rank in no determinate cla&s;s, not be|ing regular plays but rather &s;omething generally dramatic.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, how|ever, many plays of various de&s;criptions were per|formed; and, among the re&s;t, I find, from HOL|LINGSHED and other authors, one of which is RIC|COBONI, who &s;eems to have picked up good the|atrical intelligence, that, on the &s;eventh of May, 1520, the king cau&s;ed a ma&s;querade to be prepared, and ordered a &s;tage to be rai&s;ed in the great hall at GREENWICH, and the king, the queen, and the nobility came there to the repre&s;entation of a good comedy of PLAUTUS.</P>
<P>This might have been one of the foregoing plays, for, as the Engli&s;h &s;eemed to emulate the Romans in their courage and their various &s;truggles for freedom,

&s;o did they in their poetry, witne&s;s their admiration of MARTIAL in that poets life time; and tho&s;e plays were the greate&s;t part of them tran&s;lations, the co|medies from PLAUTUS and TERENCE, and the tra|gedies always from SENECA, the pomp of who&s;e &s;tyle &s;eems in all countries to have captivated the early writers.</P>
<P>Yet with all the&s;e advantages nothing worthy mentioning, except for the purpo&s;e of exciting the curio&s;ity of the reader, and filling up chronology, can be found before SHAKESPEAR.

<P>Sir JAMES LINDSAY, who we are told fir&s;t in|troduced plays into SCOTLAND, is &s;aid by &s;everal authors to have written tragedies and comedies. He was born late in the fifteenth century.

The abbot of PAISLEY, who was &s;ucce&s;sfully ridiculed in this manner, complained of him to his patron, the earl of ARRON. He, not being powerful enough to re&s;i&s;t the influence of the prie&s;t, gave up LINDSAY, who, at length, in di&s;gu&s;t retired to his paternal e&s;tate and &s;ought there that tranquility, as a phi|lo&s;opher, which had been denied to him in the world as a courtier and a poet.</P>

There he &s;tudied for two years and then found him&s;elf &s;o qualified for di&s;putation, that he did not cea&s;e for &s;eventeen years to promulgate his controver&s;ies in SWITZERLAND; when, for his love of the mother church and his zeal again&s;t the heretics, he was elevated to the degree of Doctor in Divinity, and the Four Vows.</P>

The fact however is, that when &s;ome of the Je&s;uits were condemned, and the re&s;t in danger of the law, ELIZABETH, out of hu|manity, ordered them all to be &s;hipped away and &s;ent out of ENGLAND.

<P>Of THOMAS SACKVILLE, lord DORSET, it may not be unentertaining to relate &s;ome particu|lars. He is &s;aid, in conjunction with NORTON, of whom I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;peak, to have written what is called the fir&s;t Engli&s;h tragedy. SACKVILLE was a &s;tudent of both Univer&s;ities. entered of the Tem|ple, and early called to the Bar. His deportment was &s;o manly, his manners &s;o engaging, and his wit &s;o lively, that he was &s;oon con&s;idered as an ac|qui&s;ition to the &s;tate. His father brought him into parliament, at who&s;e death he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very &s;plendid inheritance.</P>
<P>Soon after this he was knighted, and immediately promoted to a peerage by the title of baron BUCK|HURST. Determined to keep up all the con&s;equence attached to his new dignity, he launched into &s;uch magnificence and profu&s;ion that, notwith&s;tanding his immen&s;e fortune, he very &s;oon &s;uffered material in|convenience, but the tide of preferment followed on him &s;o fa&s;t that he was quickly enabled to look above his difficulties. In 1573, the queen &s;ent him am|ba&s;&s;ador to CHARLES the ninth, to congratulate that prince on his marriage with the daughter of

MAXIMILIAN, and on other &s;tate affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As this was ju&s;t after the ma&s;&s;acre of the Haguenots on the fea&s;t of St. BARTHOLOMEW; it is more than probable that tho&s;e other &s;tate affairs were &s;ome prudent conditions for the future &s;afety of the Prote&s;tants. Some have argued the very rever&s;e, but this we cannot ea&s;ily believe of ELIZABETH. She had the highe&s;t opinion of BUCKHURST as a man of uncommon penetration and &s;teadine&s;s. He was generally &s;elected out as a proper pe&s;on, being a man of profound wi&s;dom, to be con&s;ulted in all affairs of life and death. He was one of tho&s;e, being then in the privy council, who &s;at on the trial of THOMAS HOWARD, duke of NORFOLK, which lord was ex|ecuted for being concerned in a plot to recover the liberty of MARY, Queen of Scots. He was al&s;o named one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for the trial of that unhappy queen; and, though he was not pre&s;ent at her condemnation at FOTHFRINGAY CASTLE, yet, after her &s;entence was confirmed, ELIZABETH made choice of him as a per&s;on of the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s in her court, and one &s;hould think of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> feeling, to reconcile her to her hard fate, and to &s;ee the decree put in execution.</NOTE>. At the court of FRANCE he was received with all the honours due to his own merit and the dignity of his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that ELIZABETH made u&s;e of BUCKHURST to play off, fir&s;t LEICESTER and after|wards ESSEX; for he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to the States General to accommodate &s;ome differences that had ari&s;en in con&s;equence of certain conduct in the earl of LEICESTER, at which they had thought proper to take umbrage. In this commi&s;&s;ion he
<PB N="358" REF="351">
acquitted him&s;elf with great honour and rectitude. There was &s;omething in it, however, which pro|voked the re&s;entment of lord BURLEIGH, who&s;e influence was at that time &s;o great with the queen hat BUCKHURST was recalled and confined to his hou&s;e for nine months<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance may &s;erve for a le&s;&s;on to courtiers who blindly follow the re&s;entment of their employers. BUCKHURST gave neither &s;atisfaction to ELIZABETH nor BURLEIGH. The queen, though &s;he &s;ent him under a colour of ju&s;tice to rectify the&s;e mi&s;takes, rather than vindicate the offender, did not mean that he &s;hould act &s;o as to irritate her favourite; and BURLEIGH, though he was glad enough to &s;ee BUCKHURST employed in order to keep down the influence of LEICESTER, grew, however jealous of his &s;plendid abilities, and, therefore, prevailed on the queen to connive at inju&s;tice rather than give him an opportunity of getting the upper hand.</NOTE>. On LEICESTER's death, however, his intere&s;t at court was renewed to &s;uch a degree that BURLEIGH, who perhaps, feared to appear his enemy, feigned to become his friend. He was made Knight of the Garter, &s;at on the trial of the earl of ARUNDEL, and joined BURLEIGH in negociating a peace with SPAIN, which produced the renewal of a treaty with the States General; which, BURLEIGH having fallen &s;ick. BUCKHURST had all the honour of concluding; and which, as it ea&s;ed the queen of an expence amounting to a hundred and twenty thou&s;and a year, a large &s;um at that time, brought him of cour&s;e into very great &s;avour.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="352">In 1591, he was, at the particular in&s;tance of the queen, elected Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of OXFORD, in expre&s;s oppo&s;ition to her favourite the earl of ESSEX; and, on BURLEIGH's death, &s;he con&s;tituted him lord high trea&s;urer. In the following year he was joined in a commi&s;&s;ion with &s;ir THOMAS EGERTON, and lord ESSEX, to ne|gociate with the Senate of DENMARK; and when ESSEX libelled the queen, as to her conduct con|cerning IRELAND, when the mi&s;guided SOUTH|AMPTON, fuller of friend&s;hip and intemperate zeal than prudence and rea&s;on, joined that unhappy favourite, BUCKHURST was appointed lord high &s;teward upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>JAMES, who before his arrival in ENGLAND had heard a great deal of the hone&s;t &s;ervices and &s;plendid abilities of lord BUCKHURST, &s;carcely mounted the throne when he renewed that noble|man's patent of lord high trea&s;urer. In the fol|lowing year he created him earl of DORSET, and appointed him one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for exe|cuting the office of earl MARSHAL, which, how|ever, he did not long enjoy, for he died &s;ud|denly as he was &s;itting at the council table at WHITEHALL, on the 19th of April, 1608, aged &s;eventy-two.</P>

fir&s;t acts of <HI>Gorboduc,</HI> was after all, very likely, only the amanuen&s;is of SACKVILLE.

His own writings appear to have been not at all dramatic, for he was a &s;ort of enthu&s;ia&s;t. He tran&s;lated religious pieces from the latin, and being a cotemporary of STERNHOLD, and HOP|KINS, and intimate with them, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted tho&s;e no|table poets in their curious ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms.

<P>THOMAS PRESTON wrote a piece called <HI>Cam|by&s;es, King of Per&s;ia,</HI> which would have been but little known had it not been for the notice taken of it and its author by more celebrated men than PRESTON, who was, according to report, a much better actor than a poet.

<P>RICHARD EDWARDS, who was born in 1523, who ran very rapidly through a variety of &s;tudies, and was early made Ma&s;ter of Arts at OXFORD, was one of the gentlemen of queen ELIZABETH's chapel, and teacher of mu&s;ic to the children of the choir. We are told that he had a patent as manager of a theatre royal in that reign. He was certainly very highly in favour with the queen, who con|&s;tantly attended and very much admired his pro|ductions; of which the pieces known to us are, <HI>Damon and Pythias,</HI> and <HI>Palamon and Arcyte,</HI> both of which &s;ubjects are familiar to every reader, and &s;hew evidently how much, as we have &s;een before,

<P><HI>Damon and Pythias,</HI> one of the mo&s;t affecting and beautiful &s;tories of antiquity, is, con&s;idering the time, very dramatically treated by EDWARDS, but <HI>Palamon and Arcyte,</HI> taken avowedly from CHAU|CER's <HI>Knight's Tale,</HI> was the greate&s;t favourite with the court. After the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of this piece, the queen &s;ummoned the poet into her pre|&s;ence and paid him very hand&s;ome compliments. She remarked that PALAMON was &s;o ju&s;tly drawn as a lover, that he mu&s;t have been in love indeed. That ARCYTE was a right martial knight, having a &s;wart and manly countenance, yet with the a&s;pect of a VENUS clad in armour; that the lovely EMI|LIA was a virgin of uncorrupted purity and unble|mi&s;hed &s;implicity; and that, although &s;he &s;ung &s;o &s;weetly, and gathered flowers alone in the garden, &s;he pre&s;erved her cha&s;tity undeflowered. EMILIA was the only female part in the play. It was per|formed by a boy of fourteen years old, the &s;on of the dean of Chri&s;tchurch, dre&s;&s;ed like a prince&s;s, and the queen was &s;o charmed with him that &s;he pre|&s;ented him with eight guineas.

<P><PB N="364" REF="357">GEORGE PEELE, a mo&s;t excentric character, was on one account or another very celebrated early in ELIZABETH's reign.

He is &s;poken of as a very vo|luminous dramatic writer, and we are told that his works not only &s;ucceeded very greatly in his life but that they were read with great plea&s;ure after his death. He is &s;aid in particular to have been a good pa&s;toral poet. Upon the whole, however, as it is too frequently the ca&s;e, he &s;eems to have derived his reputation more from having been the object of patronage to a nobleman, than to the mu&s;es, for his merry pranks in which he is cla&s;&s;ed with SCOGGAN, SKELTON, and DICK TARLETON, all <HI>bon vivants,</HI> with whom the earl of NORTHUMBERLAND, in imi|tation of ANTHONY with the Roman actors, very often conde&s;cended to get drunk, lifted him into a degree of public opinion, which his works do not by any means appear to bear out. In &s;hort his pro|fligate manners and irregular life but little qualified him for a knowledge of that morality indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in the compo&s;ition of a real dramatic entertainment; and it is, therefore, though one of his plays has been ignorantly attributed to SHAKES|PEAR, that the licentious GEORGE PEELE, like his imitators, ROCHESTER and KILLIGREW, is little

<P>ROBERT GREEN, would have been con&s;idered as an author of merit and held in &s;ome e&s;teem had he not, in company with GEORGE PEELE, and the &s;et already mentioned, plunged him&s;elf into every &s;pecies of profligacy and debauchery; leaving a good and beautiful wi&s;e to lavi&s;h her &s;ub&s;tance on libertines and pro&s;titutes. We are told that he is the fir&s;t Engli&s;h poet who wrote for bread; having been obliged, whenever his extravagance threw him to di&s;tre&s;s, to have recour&s;e to his pen for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
<PB N="368" REF="361">
This induced him mo&s;t &s;hamefully to pro&s;titute his genius; for, knowing that tho&s;e writings would be &s;ure&s;t to &s;ell be&s;t which were the mo&s;t ob&s;cene, he gratified the rakes of that age by every &s;pecies of licentious poetry till he obtained by the&s;e worthy labours a con&s;iderable income. Penury, however, di&s;ea&s;e, the indignation of good men, and a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own infamy, led him into a gradual termination of his mi&s;erable and profligate life, which after all fini&s;hed as it had began; for, a voluptuary to the la&s;t, he died by over-eating him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some affirm that he died a penitent, and in&s;tance, to prove this a&s;&s;ertion, his having written a letter full of contrition to his injured wife, and al&s;o two or three publications of the &s;ame complexion.

<P>GREEN wrote &s;our plays, and was concerned in &s;everal others, all which evince a mind which, had
<PB N="369" REF="362">

<P>Sir PHILIP SIDNEY, who&s;e writings, public conduct, and remarkable fortunes, very peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed him, demands to be noticed in this place. He was born in 1554. He was elegantly educated, and very early &s;ent on his travels. When he was but eighteen, he narrowly e&s;caped a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion at PARIS during the ma&s;&s;acre of the huguenots; at twenty-two he was &s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y to RAN|DOLPH, emperor of GERMANY, from which time he took an active and very often a re&s;olute part as a vigilant &s;tate&s;man. He oppo&s;ed the queen's mar|riage with the duke of ANJOU, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed at the in&s;tance of his uncle the earl of LEICESTER. The queen, however, appears not to have been very well plea&s;ed; for, upon &s;ome frivolous, though vio|lent quarrel which he had with VERE, earl of OX|FORD, he was con&s;trained to retire from court.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon, however, recalled, for in 1580 he was knighted; and, immediately bringing his abili|ties into action, he projected an expedition with &s;ir FRANCIS DRAKE again&s;t AMERICA, but was again re&s;trained by the queen. She, however, made him governor of FLUSHING, which had then been ju&s;t
<PB N="370" REF="363">
put into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as one of the cautionary towns, and general of hor&s;e.</P>
<P>After this &s;ir PHILIP was permitted to pur&s;ue his career unre&s;trained; for in July, 1586, he &s;ur|prized AXIL, and, by his enterprizing and &s;pirited conduct pre&s;erved the lives and the honour of the the Engli&s;h army at GRAVELINE. From the&s;e he a&s;pired to other &s;plendid and valorous atchieve|ments, till his &s;ame was &s;o great, and &s;o univer&s;al, that he was put in election for the kingdom of PO|LAND, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed he would have carried but for the interference of the queen, who &s;aid
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;he admired his emulation but could not con&s;ent to lo&s;e his &s;ervices."</Q></P>
<P>What could be the radical cau&s;e of ELIZA|BETH's &s;trange conduct in relation to this extra|ordinary man, one moment advancing his fortune the next repelling it, is one of tho&s;e &s;tate &s;ecrets to which different authors give different motives, but are &s;eldom able to come at the truth. SIDNEY being the nephew of LEICESTER, it is very natural to &s;uppo&s;e that he partook of the &s;miles and frowns with which, according to circum&s;tances, the queen &s;avoured or threatened the uncle. All we certainly know is that her's was a &s;ort of an April kindne&s;s, and that it was &s;ometimes her cu&s;tom to lour and
<PB N="371" REF="364">
&s;ometimes to &s;hine upon her favourites; for, though &s;he loudly lamented the death of SIDNEY, when covered with glory he gallantly fell in the flower of his age at the battle of ZUTPHEN, when &s;he was told &s;ometime after that her favourite ESSEX had atchieved prodigies of valour, &s;he blamed him for his forwardne&s;s, and cried out to BURLEIGH,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why we &s;hall have him knocked on the head like that ra&s;h fellow SIDNEY."</Q></P>
<P>The literary works of &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY are various, and are allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s con&s;iderable merit. His <HI>Arcadia,</HI> by which he has been mo&s;t celebrated, ran though eight editions, though not publi&s;hed till after his death. Some e&s;teem his <HI>Apology for Poetry</HI> as his be&s;t performance, and his defence of his uncle, the earl of LEICESTER, has been &s;poken of as a &s;pirited and &s;en&s;ible production. He wrote one dramatic piece called <HI>The Lady of May.</HI></P>
<P>Sir PHILIP SIDNEY has been &s;poken of dif|ferently by different authors; but this is ea&s;ily ac|counted for. He was profe&s;&s;edly a Maecenas, and it is natural that patronage &s;hould in great mea&s;ure beget prai&s;e. This prai&s;e however be&s;towed on the poet has regularly cooled as the man has been for|gotten. He is fir&s;t extolled, afterwards prai&s;ed, then
<PB N="372" REF="365">
commended, and at la&s;t abu&s;ed. Of SIDNEY it has been &s;aid by a writer near his time,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he enjoyed and de&s;erved the mo&s;t exalted prai&s;es of his own age, and would of future ages. That SPENSER reverenced him, not only as a patron but as a ma&s;ter. That &s;o much &s;weet nature, ex|cellent behaviour, well-dige&s;ted learning, rare wit, courage, breeding, and other additional accom|pli&s;hments of conver&s;ation never before met in any one man. That he was a &s;tate&s;man, a &s;oldier, and a &s;cholar; but,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his pen and his &s;word have rendered him famous enough; for he died by the one and by the other he'll live for ever."</Q></P>
<P>This is not an exact mode of biographical cele|bration, nor indeed is it very correct &s;en&s;e; but it is panegyric which may take leave, &s;o it be warm and glowing, to be a little ab&s;urd, under an idea of &s;hrouding inaccuracy behind the dazzle of ad|miration.</P>
<P>The other author I allude to who, I hope, as he allows no po&s;thumous fame to others has no ex|pectation of any him&s;elf, &s;ays of &s;ir PHILIP SID|NEY,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that accidents of birth, court favour, and popularity, gild a &s;lender portion of merit. He had great valour, but it was an age of heroes.
<PB N="373" REF="366">
We have,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a tedious, lamentable, pe|dantic, pa&s;toral romance, which the patience of a young virgin in love cannot wade through; and &s;ome ab&s;urd attempts to fetter Engli&s;h ver&s;e in Roman chains; a proof that this applauded au|thor under&s;tood but little the genius of his own language."</Q>
After going on for &s;ome time in the &s;ame &s;train, he fini&s;hes with &s;aying that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he died with the ra&s;hne&s;s of a volunteer, after having lived to write with the <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> of Madmoi&s;elle SCUDERY."</Q></P>
<P>The fact &s;eems to be that, like BOLINBROKE, HORACE WALPOLE, and many other noble au|thors, who, by their own admirable abilities and their liberal encouragement of cotemporary writers in need of their protection, have left behind them a double claim on the gratitude of po&s;terity, &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY was not only, as FALSTAFF &s;ays, witty him&s;elf but the cau&s;e of wit in others.</P>
<P>The writings of authors of this de&s;cription are in general more the fruits of their lei&s;ure hours, and a relief from arduous avocations, than a regular em|ployment to which their inclination induce them &s;olely to attend. The works of SIDNEY are full of genius, beauty, and good &s;en&s;e; and, though they
<PB N="374" REF="367">
may not merit &s;o warm a eulogium as that be&s;towed on him by the fir&s;t author I have quoted, they are con&s;iderably above that mediocrity into which they are attempted to be lowered by the la&s;t.</P>
<P>Many more authors ought to be enumerated who, though they produced pieces during the reign of SHAKESPEAR, &s;tarted originally before him. Of the&s;e, however, little more can be noticed than that they a&s;&s;i&s;ted in preparing the &s;tage for that &s;tate of perfection towards which it was then verging but which certainly it would never have attained but for the incomparable and unparalleled talents of our immortal bard. It may not be ami&s;s, however, to remark that &s;ome of the&s;e were men of no mean abilities.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER NEVILL made a very early pro|gre&s;s in learning, and at &s;ixteen a&s;&s;ociated with the celebrated JASPER HEYWOOD in tran&s;lating the tragedies of SENECA. In this a&s;&s;ociation, NEW|TON, a very learned writer, who was fir&s;t a &s;chool|ma&s;ter, and who, through the patronage of ROBERT earl of ESSEX, became beneficed, NUCE, who is &s;aid rather to have attempted plays in the manner of SENECA than to have tran&s;lated SENECA him&s;elf, STUDLY, who was a &s;tudent at CAMBRIDGE, and
<PB N="375" REF="368">
afterwards killed at the &s;iege of BREDA under the command of prince MAURICE, were all members. Among this fraternity who worked &s;eparately as well as in conjunction, almo&s;t the whole of SE|NECA's tragedies were rendered into Engli&s;h, and &s;everal others invented; by which efforts the En|gli&s;h &s;tage boa&s;ted, if not the fancy of GREECE, at lea&s;t the regularity of ROME.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e were FULWELL, who is &s;poken of as an ingenious writer, and who produced one piece called <HI>Like will to like quothe the Devil to the Collier;</HI> LUPTON who wrote a play called <HI>All for Money;</HI> INGELAND, wrote <HI>The Di&s;obedient Child;</HI> NASH, who was a companion of GREEN and his di&s;oliate friends, and who but for his pro|fligacy might have ranked well as an author, for he was remarkable for keen and witty &s;atire; KYFFIN, who tran&s;lated one of the comedies of TERENCE, and who was tutor to the children of his patron, lord BUCKHURST; GOLDING, who tran&s;lated many celebrated works with great reputation; and &s;everal other authors that might be named, be&s;ides anony|mous playwrights out of number, who&s;e pieces are entered at Stationer's Hall.</P>
<P>Thus out of a very large ma&s;s of materials I
<PB N="376" REF="369">
have &s;elected &s;uch particulars as I con&s;idered fully adequate to illu&s;trate all I have advanced relative to the antiquity of the Engli&s;h theatre. I &s;hall now fir&s;t enquire into the merit of the early actors, and afterwards recapitulate &s;uch circum&s;tances as may be yet nece&s;&s;ary to go over, in order to give SHAKES|PEAR a clear &s;tage on his fir&s;t appearance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;peak of the antiquity of Engli&s;h acting with a view of &s;hewing what it particularly was would be impo&s;&s;ible, and even to take it up generally would be to leave it in a very indefinite &s;tate. We might &s;ay with great truth that ALFRED, RICHARD, COEUR DE LION, and many other princes were actors, that the monks, out of all enumeration, were actors, and that the kingdom at different times &s;warmed with actors, who were always correctly of the &s;ame de|&s;cription, even from the time of the Roman con|que&s;t to the vagrant act of EDWARD the third.</P>
<P>The particular merits of the&s;e men, however, will never be known, and &s;ome may think it not very ma|terial that they &s;hould; were it po&s;&s;ible, however, to get at them I &s;hould lo&s;e no diligence in the &s;earch; for, though it is certainly true that the man who merely utters cannot &s;tand the &s;ame chance of po&s;thu|mous
<PB N="378" REF="371">
fame as the man who writes, yet the obligation Was mutual while the actor lived; and I don't &s;ee why the poet, who&s;e works he &s;et off, &s;hould neglect to celebrate that merit without which he him&s;elf would never have been celebrated. What pains have been taken to perpetuate the memory of ROSCIUS! Kings, poets, and philo&s;ophers, have written and &s;poken his eulogium. To RICHARD's being an actor, ENGLAND owed the relea&s;e of that monarch, and to the adroitne&s;s of ALFRED in the &s;ame ca|pacity &s;prung the victory over the Danes.</P>
<P>The &s;imilarity of the progre&s;s of acting in EN|GLAND and FRANCE has been already noticed. In FRANCE we find no actors celebrated by name till we get at TURLUPIN and his companions intro|duced by the farces of the Children of Sans Souci; and here, though we find a pretty &s;trong contention between the &s;tudents at St. PAUL's &s;chool and the clerks at Clerkenwell, yet till the interludes of HEYWOOD, in which he him&s;elf, &s;ir THOMAS MORE, and others a&s;&s;i&s;ted, we learn nothing of the particular merits of an actor.</P>
<P>From this time, however, we begin to get pretty well acquainted with them, and find that, either for plea&s;ure or profit that knot of <HI>bon vivants</HI> which were headed by GREEN, PEELE, and NASH, were
<PB N="379" REF="372">
all actors. The mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the groupe is TARLETON, who&s;e hi&s;tory contains &s;ome whim&s;ical particulars. He was brought to town from SHROP|SHIRE by one of the &s;ervants of lord LEICESTER, who found him in a field taking care of his father's &s;wine, and was &s;o plea&s;ed with his an&s;wers that he introduced him to the earl, who a&s;toni&s;hed at the quickne&s;s of his intellects, brought him to court where he became a &s;ort of je&s;ter to the queen.</P>
<P>We are told that there were times when ELIZA|BETH preferred TARLETON to all her favourites; that the courtiers paid him the greate&s;t homage, and often employed him to pave the wayv for their kind reception. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When the queen,"</Q> &s;ays an author,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was &s;erious, I dare not &s;ay &s;ullen, TARLETON could undumpi&s;h her at his plea&s;ure. He told her more of her faults than mo&s;t of her chaplains, and cured her of her melancholy better than all her phylicians."</Q></P>
<P>TARLETON was an actor at the Bull in Bi&s;hop|gate-&s;treet, and performed originally in the play of <HI>Henry the Fifth,</HI> from which SHAKESPEAR is &s;up|po&s;ed to have collected the materials for his play under the &s;ame title. Suppo&s;ing, however, this report to be truth, it could have furni&s;hed him only with a few hints, for it had neither FLUELLIN,
<PB N="380" REF="373">
PISTOL, the HOSTESS, or any of tho&s;e excellent characters which we know to have been SHAKES|PEAR's invention, or rather his imitation from nature.</P>
<P>When ELIZABETH, at the &s;olicitation of &s;ir FRANCIS WALSINGHAM, appointed a dozen players to perform at BARN-ELMS, allowing them wages, and liveries as grooms of the chamber, TAR|LETON was made a &s;ort of manager. An old au|thor &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"that for the clown's part he never had his equal.</Q> Even BEN JOHNSON, who libels actors, could not refrain from applauding TARLETON. In|deed, by all accounts, his humour was of an irre|&s;i&s;table kind, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething like that of WESTON, for we are told that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;elf &s;ame words &s;poken by another would hardly move a merry man to &s;mile, which uttered by him would force a &s;ad &s;oul to laughter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">"There are many &s;tories related of TARLETON, two of which at lea&s;t appears to be fabrications. Every one knows that RABELAIS, when he had not a &s;ous in his pocket, contrived to fea&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly all the way from PROVINCE to PARIS, by wrapping up brickdu&s;t in different papers, and writing on them
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Poi&s;on for the king, poi&s;on for the queen, poi&s;on for the dauphin;"</Q>
by which &s;tra|tagem he contrived to be conveyed at the expence of the govern|ment as a &s;tate pri&s;oner. A &s;imilar &s;tory is trumpt up for TARLETON; who, having run up a large &s;core at an alehou&s;e in SANDWICH, made a &s;ervant boy accu&s;e him as a &s;eminary prie&s;t, and &s;o contrived that the officers of ju&s;tice when they came in &s;earch of him found him on his knees cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf. The&s;e vigilant mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, fancying they &s;hould make a good thing of this di&s;covery, paid his reckoning and conveyed him to London; but when he came before FLEETWOOD, the recorder, who knew him and recognized in this trick one of the well known exploits of TARLETON, he not only di&s;charged him but courteou&s;ly entertained him in return for his wit. Another time, when he was in a &s;torm and the pa&s;&s;engers were or|dered to throw their mo&s;t cumber&s;ome luggage overboard, he is &s;aid to have reque&s;ted that he might throw his wife into the &s;ea, which po&s;&s;ibly might have happened, and that is all we can &s;ay, for it has been a joke for more than two thou&s;and years. By the way, TAR|LETON is &s;aid to have rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to be di&s;encumbered of his wife, for he was a notorious cuckold; nay, they go &s;o far as to &s;ay that Cuckold's Point was &s;o named by a waterman as he one day landed TARLETON at that place.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="374">TARLETON for &s;ome time kept a tavern in Paterno&s;ter Row, and afterwards the &s;ign of the Tabor in Grace Church Street, where his humour operated as &s;uch an attraction that it was common to have his portrait as a &s;ign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Bi&s;hop HALL's Satires we find the&s;e words: <Q>" To &s;it with TARLETON on an ale po&s;t's &s;ign.!"</Q></NOTE>. OLDYS &s;ays that there was a &s;ign in the Borough of a man playing on the pipe and tabor with the name of TARLETON written under it, and that this portrait was a copy of a wooden print which was publi&s;hed at the head of a work called <HI>Tarleton's Je&s;ts</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">LORD OXFORD had a portrait of TARLETON with his tabor and pipe certainly taken from the print in the front of this je&s;t book. He is there repre&s;ented in his Clown's dre&s;s, playing on his pipe with one hand and beating the drum with the other. This print is &s;aid to have been &s;o well cut, that a flatne&s;s appears upon the no&s;e which was occa&s;ioned by a wound he got in parting &s;ome dogs and bears. This misfortune he turned into merriment by noticing that it did not affect him, for that he had &s;till &s;agacity enough to &s;mell a knave from an hone&s;t man.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="375">He wrote one dramatic piece called <HI>The Seven Deadly Sins;</HI> and this appears to have been when tired of his debaucheries, he, like GREEN and NASH, pretended to repent of his irregularities; at which time his wit &s;eems to have dwindled into mere &s;currility, for, as he grew debilitated with his exce&s;&s;es, he became &s;our and &s;arca&s;tic. None e&s;|caped his virulence, not even LEICESTER, and RALIEGH; till, being di&s;carded from court, and growing every day more contemptible in the world's opinion, he died like VOLTAIRE a mixture of im|becility, folly, and irre&s;olution.</P>
<P>SCOGGAN, according to the mo&s;t probable ac|counts of him, was a wicked wit. He had none of the humour of TARLETON, the &s;terling &s;en&s;e of GREEN, the &s;atire of NASH, nor the barefaced ri|baldry of PEELE; but he had a cunning that gave him abilities to cope with them all. He would at|tack every man's darling foible and appear to be his ma&s;ter in his own art, by which means, though al|ways needy, he always got prai&s;e, confidence, and a
<PB N="383" REF="376">
good bellyful. If TARLETON laughed at his pau|city of wit, he laughed at TARLETON by making him a cuckold; if GREEN reproached him with his poverty, he took revenge by helping GREEN off with his money; if NASH provoked him by his &s;atire he warded off the &s;haft by callous indifference; and if PEELE made him u&s;eful in the city pageants, he not only fea&s;ted well at his expence, but he &s;nacked the fees and pawned the ornaments. Thus his acting was more &s;erviceable to him off than on the &s;tage, where his abilities are &s;aid to have been but mediocre. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, however, of thus playing upon his companions, and now and then on their common patron, the earl of NORTHUMBER|LAND, SCOGGAN topic care, though he got into all their &s;crapes, to keep him&s;elf clear of the con&s;e|quences of them.</P>
<P>Concerning &s;ome of the other performers of that time I have already &s;poken. PRESTON was very celebrated, &s;o was SKELTON, and &s;o were many of the company that performed under the direction of EDWARDS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The young &s;cholars bred up under EDWARDS, are very warmly celebrated as excellent actors. In the play of <HI>Palamon and Arcyte,</HI> I have already noticed the youth who performed the part of the Prince&s;s, and that he was &s;on to the Dean of Chri&s;t Church, which will &s;hew that acting at that time was by no means thought di&s;graceful; but we &s;hall &s;ee that not only acting, con&s;idered as a picture of human manners, but that mimickry was then performed to admiration; for we are told, that in the play in que&s;tion, a cry of hounds was &s;o perfectly acted that the queen and all the court could not credit but that it was real.</NOTE>. Indeed as to their particular merit
<PB N="384" REF="377">
it is extremely difficult to arrive at any critical knowledge of them. The &s;pecimen I have given of TARLETON's celebrity will, however, prove that the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor was completely known at that time, for nothing can depict the true merit of comic acting better than the te&s;ti|mony of the different poets and critics who have particularly &s;poken of their admiration of his talents, a very &s;mall part of which admiration I have quoted.</P>
<P>This account, however, will &s;erve to &s;hew that actors were at that early period very profligate characters; that they debauched the morals of young noblemen and inexperienced youths of every de&s;cription; and that whatever morality they might di&s;&s;eminate by their precepts, they cut it up by the roots by their example. This occa&s;ioned tho&s;e decrees of ELIZABETH which were &s;o often al|ternately enforced and broken, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a nece&s;&s;ity for the mo&s;t vigilant attention on the part of the &s;tate le&s;t what was intended to improve and poli&s;h public manners &s;hould corrupt and di&s;|grace
<PB N="385" REF="378">

As dramatic amu&s;ements gained &s;trength on the &s;ide of genius, truth, and morality, the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor became more re&s;pectable, till, at length, during the epoch to which we are ha&s;tening, the theatre was &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed that it was never &s;haken again till the troubles in the reign of the fir&s;t CHARLES.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A SUMMARY RECAPITULATION, FROM THE DRUIDS TO SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>UPON a review of what I have hitherto written on the Engli&s;h theatre, though many may think the &s;ub|ject unimportant before the birth of SHAKESPEAR, yet I cannot repent of having explored a field full of circum&s;tances material to the elucidation of a popular theme, even at the ri&s;k of being cen&s;ured by cavillers for exciting rather than gratifying curio|&s;ity; for, though the intelligence I have been able to offer is too often &s;hrouded with doubt and ob|&s;curity, a misfortune, by the bye, con&s;tantly at|tendant on every review of lives and actions, yet if it produce no other literary benefit, the national incidents that are naturally interwoven with dra|matic narrative mu&s;t inevitably give it &s;ome in|tere&s;t; and, though it is not to be expected that rational men &s;hould value this or any other theme merely for its antiquity, yet, the more rational the
<PB N="387" REF="380">
man, the more he will be induced to allow that the &s;anction of ages will confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the im|portance of every thing avowedly and meritoriou&s;ly con&s;tituted for the in&s;truction and delight of the world, and the medium and criterion for the regu|lation of its manners.</P>
<P>If all I have collected of the bards with the Druids at their head, and have thereby &s;hewn that every thing lyric is in its e&s;&s;ence dramatic, is im|portant, I have gained my end. It were in vain to argue that it is not to be credited becau&s;e it is con|jectural. Conjecture from deduction &s;wells into rea&s;on, and rea&s;on upon &s;uch ground grows into truth. If, therefore, the Druids exi&s;ted, if the Welch bards exi&s;ted, if OSSIAN led on the Scotch bards, or imitated what in his infancy he had im|bibed from oral tradition, or even if he had never written, but on the contrary, if all that is attributed to him was gathered from Scotch elders and nur&s;es, who, though perfect in the beauties of that poetry they &s;ung, the olde&s;t of them had not the remote&s;t clue to its origin, yet the whole is a ma&s;s of &s;uch fair probability that no &s;ophi&s;try can &s;hake it; and, therefore, the ta&s;k, if novel is worthy curio&s;ity, if probable is entitled to attention, and if intere&s;ting will be con&s;idered as meritorious.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="381">If the Mimes of the Romans came over with JULIUS CAESAR, and that they did, I do not &s;ee the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to doubt, ENGLAND mu&s;t de|cidedly have then known the dramatic art, or el&s;e PACUVIUS, ACCIUS, and LIVIUS ANDRONICUS were ignorant of it. BOADICEA tells us it did, nay, indeed, &s;o does MARTIAL, &s;o that we have both Engli&s;h and Roman authority for it.</P>
<P>After the Romans, the chain is &s;o regular from ARTHUR to ALFRED, and &s;o on through the do|minion of the Saxons, that in the celebration of great actions, carou&s;als, tournaments, and other fea&s;ts, we clearly lead the provincial poets, the drift of all who&s;e writings was dramatic. The&s;e the rulers, and principal per&s;onages of the land, took a delight in encouraging. Public rites, exerci&s;es, and amu&s;ements, all received the &s;anction and counte|nance of the great, and were con&s;idered of &s;o much advantage to manners, that the prie&s;ts were content, as in all other countries, to imitate the &s;tage in order to enforce the doctrines of the pulpit.</P>
<P>Had the prie&s;ts never taken the matter up, and they certainly did take it up from St. AUSTIN forwards, the &s;tage mo&s;t probably would never have been known at all in ENGLAND till SHAKES|PEAR
<PB N="389" REF="382">
for, however, the vivacity and perpetual curio&s;ity of the French might induce them to &s;earch for every po&s;&s;ible minute circum&s;tance to give pompous accounts of an amu&s;ement in their country, in which they have &s;o greatly delighted, the more indolent and incurious &s;pirit of Engli&s;h writers, who are pleated more to perform than to celebrate, have, I &s;ee not why, certainly pa&s;&s;ed it by as a matter of little moment, and thereby lo&s;t to po&s;terity what made up, and if the remnants of an|tiquity which have been &s;aved from the general wreck may &s;tand as a proof, meritoriou&s;ly made up the rational delight of our ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>But the grand objection will be, that, however I may &s;peak of dramatic entertainments, nothing ought to be con&s;idered in that light but tragedy and comedy. In this enthu&s;ia&s;m in favour of a di&s;|tinction which originally was very indefinite, the one being in GREECE <HI>The Song of the Goat,</HI> and the other <HI>The Song of the Village,</HI> one, therefore, im|plying a particular event, and the other a general amu&s;ement, we &s;et up a di&s;tinction of our own, and we define tragedy to be a dramatic poem in which &s;ome &s;ignal action of illu&s;trious per&s;ons is repre|&s;ented ending in general fatally<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This definition has &s;et the poets together by the ears upon the mo&s;t natural ground in the world; becau&s;e a term, e&s;tabli&s;hed from a principle totally different, has, through their filtration of its &s;en&s;e, obtained another meaning. Tho&s;e who originally invented tragedy, in which was intended nothing more than a hymn in honour of BAC|CHUS, little dreamt that this word would be u&s;ed to &s;ignify the great and warlike actions of heroes and legi&s;lators, and that this com|memorating the death of a goat &s;hould afterward record the death of emperors. ARISTOTLE, very gravely and with the con&s;ent of his partizans, tells us,, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tragedy is the imitation of one grave and entire action of a ju&s;t length,"</Q>
an ob&s;ervation that could be|long to nobody but ARISTOTLE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of narration, by rai&s;ing of terror and compa&s;&s;ion, refines and purges our pa&s;&s;ions"</Q>
Now it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to in&s;i&s;t on wor&s;e non-&s;en&s;e than this. My author &s;ays very gravely that this definition has thrown the critics into great perplexity; and no great wonder: for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ju&s;t length, the exi&s;tence of a tragedy without narration,"</Q> a a thing which is actually narration in action, and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the terror and compa&s;&s;ion which ought alone to be excited by tragedy,"</Q>
is a cru&s;t for the critics which ARISTOTLE alone knew how to dige&s;t. Many opinions have been upon this &s;ubject rendered inexplicable by pedantry; and even CORNEILLI, who&s;e mind was rather firm, jnd who&s;e opinion was pretty decided, mode&s;ty urges
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he cannot reconcile ARISTOTLE with him&s;elf; for that his rea&s;ons defeat his definition."</Q>
Nay, he even denies the purging of our pa&s;&s;ions to be the end of tragedy. As to the general &s;en&s;e of every definition of comedy it is extremely different to torture it into any thing but its vernacular meaning; but, with all this &s;elf evident truth &s;taring him in the face, poor ARISTOTLE chu&s;es to cavil here; for he will not allow any thing to be comedy but an expo&s;ition of the wor&s;t and lowe&s;t kind of men by way of ridicule. What then becomes of all that &s;ucce&s;sful humour by which characters in high life have been laughed at and expo&s;es Tho&s;e who &s;hould be our imitation and who degenerate being, &s;urely the mo&s;t eligible food for fair critici&s;m; what becomes of WYCHERLY, GAY, FARQUAR, VANBURGH, and CIBBER, and what becomes of that very CONGREVE who writes a libel again&s;t him&s;elf by &s;upporting ARISTOTLE in this &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent a&s;&s;ertion.</NOTE>;
<PB N="390" REF="383">
which is much nearer the matter, a repre&s;entation of actions in private life, generally holding up the follies
<PB N="391" REF="384">
of our neighbours to ridicule to deter the &s;pectators from imitating ab&s;urdities which the&s;e pieces ex|po&s;e. Therefore we have not invented what was unknown to the ancients, but have merely improved upon their inventions; and in con&s;equence we have not to brag of having rejected their art and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed one of our own; but that, as the world has become more poli&s;hed, we have availed our|&s;elves of an art belonging to them, which we might probably our&s;elves have otherwi&s;e been ignorant of.</P>
<P>Under this idea we are obliged to admit the an|tiquity of the drama or reject it altogether. Every thing improves as human intelligence grows and ex|pands. This, however, does not alter the original principle. The original principle of the drama was to repre&s;ent manners in action; and, as far as this point was effected, it ever exi&s;ted and never altered nor degenerated, but in obedience to times and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Let us not, therefore, becau&s;e dramatic pieces were not written in &s;ome peculiar &s;tyle or manner,
<PB N="392" REF="385">
becau&s;e they were not divided into acts, becau&s;e they were not meted by the &s;ame mea&s;ure, nor poi&s;ed by the &s;ame weight, deny that there is any di&s;tinction in the &s;pirit of them anciently, and now. AESCUYLUS knew what they ought to be, and he knew it in full as great perfection as ARISTOTLE, becau&s;e ARIS|TOTLE &s;tole all his knowledge from AESCHYLUS and his cotemporaries; and, if AESCHYLUS, who imi|tated HOMER, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this knowledge, it is folly and ignorance to deny that the dramatic art was known at any period in which men of eru|dition exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is upon this principle I in&s;i&s;t that the dramatic art exi&s;ted or was known in this country as early as the Druids, for the Druids &s;tudied the Greeks, and who among the Greeks ranked &s;o forward as the dramatic poets?</P>
<P>Thus far have I argued in favour of the dra|matic art on the &s;core of its antiquity; it mu&s;t be remembered I have not argued on the &s;core of its perfection; but if I had it would not have de|tracted from the value of my rea&s;oning; for, &s;ince SHAKESPEAR, we have &s;een the &s;tage degenerate mo&s;t mi&s;erably; and, if I were inclined to in&s;tance periods when the theatre within the la&s;t century de|&s;erved no more to be con&s;idered in a &s;tate of per|fection
<PB N="393" REF="386">
that it did &s;everal centuries pa&s;t, my ob&s;er|vations might be thought invidious but they could not be ea&s;ily attached. Nay, were I put to it, I might avail my&s;elf of arguing that a degenerate fall from the pinnacle on which SHAKESPEAR and his cotemporaries placed it in, is more degrading than the imperfect &s;tate in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;unk before it had the advantage of &s;o great and &s;o &s;hining an example.</P>
<P>If none of the&s;e arguments will exculpate me from the heavy charge of venturing hi&s;torical cir|cum&s;tances which, though highly probable, I cannot po&s;itively prove, let me in common with all hi&s;to|rians and biographers claim the privilege of avail|ing my&s;elf of every thing po&s;itive and collateral that could po&s;&s;ibly make out my rea&s;oning, of joining admitted facts with rational conjecture, of corro|borating what we believe with what we know, and of gaining credit for having e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome little authenticity on a vague and uncertain, though by no means an unimportant, &s;ubject, by the a&s;&s;iduous and indu&s;trious care with which it has been explored.</P>
<P>Over and above this, let the collaterally hi&s;torical facts which have &s;prung from the &s;ubject, like agree|able objects that cheat the way on a rugged road,
<PB N="394" REF="387">
afford &s;ome amu&s;ement in relief of that jolting which I have given the reader's imagination. I did not profe&s;s to go on a turnpike road. There are no mile &s;tones, the way is not mea&s;ured, it is com|puted; and, if there were ever any direction po&s;ts, they have been long ago broken down and de&s;|troyed. It was, neverthele&s;s, a road, and we have come &s;afely through it; and the few ve&s;tiges that prove it was formerly frequented, though there may not be much beauty and &s;ymmetry in them, have neverthele&s;s an intere&s;ting and a picture&s;que effect. An effect like the productions of CLAUDE, who&s;e ruins &s;eem to a&s;&s;ume a venerable complacency communicated by the richne&s;s of the &s;etting &s;un that &s;oberly glows behind them.</P>
<P>By way of companion to this picture, let us turn our eyes to a grey morn full of aerial effect, and giving a cheering promi&s;e that the &s;ame &s;un which &s;et &s;o &s;erenely &s;olemn the evening before, &s;hall again di&s;play its comforting influence till by a gradual and invigorating encrea&s;e of power and ra|diance, it at length gather into a bur&s;t of the mo&s;t dazzling &s;plendour.</P>
<P>In this idea we &s;hall have a fair re&s;emblance of the theatre from the time of HEYWOOD and the interludes. The my&s;teries, and the moralities, hav|ing
<PB N="395" REF="388">
gradually declined and, at length, &s;unk into oblivion, manners in action began to exhibit a dawn of that day in which the objects of nature were at fir&s;t faintly di&s;cerned, afterwards more perfectly &s;een, and at la&s;t acknowledged in all their charms, through the re&s;plendant genius of SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P>The chaos into which the dramatic art was then crumbled began to ferment and di&s;tend it&s;elf. BUCKHURST a&s;&s;i&s;ted the proce&s;s; &s;o, with the help of SENECA, did NASH, NEVILLE, NEWTON, STUDLY, NUCE, and the re&s;t, who &s;eem to have been to JASPER HEYWOOD &s;omething like what CHAPLAINE and his worthy companions were to RICHELIEU; the tran&s;lators of TERENCE made the atoms dance a little more, EDWARDS, by the help of CHAUCER and BOCCACE, began to arrange them, PEELE drilled them as well as he could but he gave them too volatile a motion, LILLY led them forward in a kind of minuet but mi&s;took di&s;|tortion for grace, PRESTON put them into &s;tilts, NORTON made them &s;ing p&s;alms, LINDSEY held up a mirror to &s;hew them their deformity, SIDNEY made them courtly, and others did what they could to move the mon&s;trous heap, &s;eperate it, and mould it into form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir PHILIP SIDNEY &s;ays, &s;peaking of the &s;tage in his time,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Our tragedies and comedies ob&s;erve rules neither of hone&s;t civility, or &s;kilful poetry. Here you &s;hall have ASIA of the one &s;ide, and AFRICA of the other, and &s;o many other under kingdoms, that the player when he comes in, mu&s;t begin with telling where he is, or el&s;e the tale will not be conceived. Now you &s;hall have three la|dies walk to gather flowers, and then we mu&s;t believe the &s;tage to be a garden. By and by we hear news of a &s;hipwreck in the &s;ame place, then we are to blame if we accept it not for a rock. Upon the back of that comes out a hideous mon&s;ter with fire and &s;moke, and then the mi&s;erable beholders are bound to take it for a cave: while in the mean time two armies flie in, repre&s;ented with four &s;words and bucklers, and then what hard heart will not receive it for a pitched held? Now of time they are much more liberal. For ordinarily it is that two young princes fall in love, after many tra|ver&s;es the lady is got with child, delivered of a fair boy, he is lo&s;t, groweth a man, falleth in love, and is ready to get another child; and all this in two hours &s;pace: which how ab&s;urd it is in &s;en&s;e, even &s;en&s;e may imagine."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="389">Still, however, the work was very imperfect. The rugged and mi&s;hapened fragments, as they took all manner of mon&s;trous and di&s;torted forms, ran about in all directions, exhibiting every appearance but nature. By continual and &s;teady per&s;everance, however, the artificers that had the work in hand began to mould it into better fa&s;hion; till, at length, to keep up the allu&s;ion, Envy, like the Devil, be|gan to be jealous of this dramatic approach towards order, for we find a book, dedicated to &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY, by STEPHEN GOSSON, called <HI>The School of Abu&s;e, a plea&s;ant invective again&s;t Poets, Pipers, Players, Je&s;ters, and &s;uch like Catterpillars of the</HI>
<PB N="397" REF="390">
<HI>Commonwealth;</HI> and another called <HI>Plays confuted in five Actions.</HI> This book, which is dedicated to &s;ir FRANCIS WALSINGHAM, labours very hard to prove that plays are calculated to promote licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s and immorality, and, therefore, ought not to be &s;uffered in a commonwealth.</P>
<P>The&s;e publications begat a long controver&s;y which was very warmly taken up again&s;t GOSSON by LODGE and THOMAS HEYWHOD, which la&s;t, we &s;hall hereafter &s;ee, according to his own report indeed, wrote, or had a hand, or at lea&s;t a main finger, his own expre&s;&s;ion, in two hundred plays. At the time, however, of his entering the li&s;ts with GOSSON, he was very young, and it &s;erved to help him forward in much the &s;ame manner, though the circum&s;tances are not alike, as the di&s;pute with MOLIERE which brought BOURSAULT into notice. GOSSON was attacked very &s;ucce&s;sfully. The di&s;|pute, however, did general &s;ervice; for, as there was much to expo&s;e in the conduct of the &s;tage and its adherents, &s;o the appeal to &s;ir FRANCIS WAL|SINGHAM, and &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY, &s;o far called forth their interference, that they examined the abu&s;es, and occa&s;ioned them in material points to be rectified.</P>
<P>Thus the labourers in this meritorious work
<PB N="398" REF="391">
went on in the mo&s;t &s;trenuous and animated manner, and wrought the better for being watched. If a poet thought he had made a perfect form in a play, a biting and &s;evere &s;atire convinced him, or at lea&s;t the world, that it was mon&s;trous and unnatural. However he might fancy that his ideas were &s;ub|lime, and his ver&s;es flowing and ea&s;y, &s;ome critic was &s;ure to po&s;&s;e&s;s the world with an opinion that his &s;ubject was the bathos, that his &s;tyle halted, and that his mea&s;ure limped.</P>
<P>The&s;e were, however, good &s;ymptoms. The warmer the &s;un&s;hine the more the flies are engen|dered. Crouds of authors begat crouds of critics. Tho&s;e, therefore, who had written crudely began now to try at writing elegantly. The great difficulty was to &s;hape invention, which many of them had, into regularity. To do this they called in the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as we have &s;een, of SENECA and TERENCE; for, however, in a much earlier period the genius of the Greeks might have pervaded the Engli&s;h ta&s;te, we &s;ee no vi&s;ible traces of it at this particular time; nor is there any &s;oleci&s;m in this. The prie&s;ts knew the Greek poets and mo&s;t carefully cho&s;e them for their models; but this continued no longer than during the continuation of the my&s;teries; for at the moment the Engli&s;h authors improved in one hand into plays, they on the other hand mi&s;took the
<PB N="399" REF="392">
road as to con&s;truction and &s;tyle; and, therefore, followed the unintere&s;ting and phlegmatic Romans in&s;tead of imitating the great and original Greeks.</P>
<P>In this labyrinth were the poets of that time be|wildered, or rather, to keep on with my fir&s;t figure, in this chaos were they overwhelmed and enthralled. Some fancied that the inflated SENECA would open to them all the arcana of tragedy, and others than in the tame TERENCE con&s;i&s;ted all the merit of comedy. Under this influence they forgot the language in which they wrote, the manners of their countrymen, and the particular &s;tyle in which to ap|peal to their pa&s;&s;ions and their hearts.</P>
<P>Thus the unwieldy ma&s;s they had to move, to concoct, to form, to animate, was too mighty a ta&s;k for their exertions. It remained that the literary glory of GREECE &s;hould be born anew in the bard of ENGLAND. It remained for a genius, great, powerful, and commanding, with the maje&s;ty of HOMER, the judgment of AESCHYLUS, the &s;weet|ne&s;s of SOPHOCLES, the philo&s;ophy of EURIPIDES, the wit of ARISTOPHANES, and the truth of ME|NANDER, to reconcile &s;o many jarring opinions and to perfect this chaos into a world.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR was this genius; and &s;o well by
<PB N="400" REF="393">
him were the&s;e jarring intere&s;ts reconciled, that all the poets with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the critics cannot, up to that time, nor perhaps &s;ince, except in his own works, find any tragedy and comedy that appeals &s;o forcibly to the heart, &s;o perfectly &s;a|tisfies the mind, or indeed that &s;o completely tri|umphs over all candid objection, as <HI>Othello,</HI> and <HI>The Merry Wives of Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>The genius of SHAKESPEAR then was the power that formed this chaos into a world. SHAKESPEAR; who, for his perfecting the dramatic art, de&s;erves the ineffable reverence of ages; and who, for giv|ing light to the theatrical world, might &s;natch the epitaph from the tomb of NEWTON.</P>
