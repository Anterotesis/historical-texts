<L>A Rope-maker a Poet!&mdash;write a play!</L>
<L>O hang the blockhead! wicked wits will &s;ay;</L>
<L>&mdash;Before you turn him off&mdash;a word I pray.</L>
<L>Genius is not to place, or &s;tate fix'd down,</L>
<L>But flies at random all about the town;</L>
<L>Now at Whitehall, now at St. James's &s;miles,</L>
<L>Then whi&s;ks to Wapping, or to Broad St. Giles.</L>
<L>O let not prejudice, rank weed, take root,</L>
<L>Which may of Genius choak the faire&s;t fruit:</L>
<L>If none but gentlemen high-born mu&s;t write,</L>
<L>I fear we &s;oon &s;hould wi&s;h you all good night!</L>
<L>Shake&s;peare and John&s;on, our Dramatick Lords,</L>
<L>Did they amu&s;e them&s;elves with twi&s;ting cords?</L>
<L><PB N="226" REF="4">
Were they fine gentlemen?&mdash;O no&mdash;Old Ben</L>
<L>Was famous for his trowel as his pen;</L>
<L>With mortar and the Mu&s;e he pa&s;s'd his days,</L>
<L>And built good walls, before he built good plays.</L>
<L>Shake&s;peare, a genius born! his ta&s;te was &s;uch,</L>
<L>Too exqui&s;ite! he lov'd fat buck too much!</L>
<L>And he who&s;e matchle&s;s mu&s;e can &s;often rocks,</L>
<L>Fled to Parna&s;&s;us to avoid the Stocks.</L>

<L>Now to the Rope-maker I come again,&mdash;</L>
<L>Who having &s;pun much hemp, now &s;pins his brain:</L>
<L>This <HI>hempen</HI> produce any te&s;t will &s;tand;</L>
<L>This, of his brain, may prove a rope of &s;and;</L>
<L>But &s;hould this &s;pinning of his head deceive him,</L>
<L>This hempen manufacture may relieve him!</L>
<L>Had I but time to give my fancy &s;cope,</L>
<L>I'd &s;hew, how <HI>tragedy</HI> was like a <HI>rope;</HI></L>
<L>How &s;everal parts well twi&s;ted, make a whole,</L>
<L>To curb the pa&s;&s;ions, and to melt the &s;oul.</L>
<L>The cau&s;e of ju&s;tice each alike befriends,</L>
<L>Both &s;alutary means for moral ends;</L>
<L>Thus the mo&s;t crabbed <HI>Critic</HI> plainly &s;ees,</L>
<L>That making <HI>Ropes</HI> is writing <HI>Tragedies:</HI></L>
<L>And &s;hould he fail to plea&s;e, poor &s;cribbling el&s;&mdash;</L>

<L>ALL fable is figure&mdash;I your bard will maintain it,</L>

<L>The lyre of our Orpheus, means your approba|tion;</L>

<L>Should want make his mi&s;tre&s;s too keen to di&s;|pute,</L>

<L>Your favour brings comfort; at once cures the evil;</L>
<L>For '&s;caping bum-bailiffs, is '&s;caping the devil.</L>
<L>Nay, Cerberus critics their fury will drop:</L>
<L>For &s;uch barking mon&s;ters, your &s;miles are a &s;op.</L>

But now to explain what you mo&s;t will require,</L>
<L>That cows, &s;heep, and calves, &s;hould dance after the lyre.</L>

<HEAD>SONG, &s;ung by Mr. LOWE, at Drury-lane Theatre, 20th November, 1740<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the performance of the TEMPEST, for the Benefit of Captain Pedlie's Crew, who on this occa&s;ion came on the Stage, and returned thanks; the Prince of Wales, Father of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, honoured the Theatre writh his attendance. Captain Peddie was Commander of the Prince of Orange, homeward bound from St. Chri&s;topher's. Oct. 23, after a tedi|ous pa&s;&s;age, about 30 leagues E. of Scilly, he was attacked by a Spani&s;h Privateer of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">8 guns, as many &s;wivels, and 150 Men. The Spaniards hol&s;ting Engli&s;h Colours, Capt. Peddie had no &s;u&s;picion of him till he was clo&s;e on board, when his adver&s;ary poured in a broad&s;ide upon him with all his &s;mall arms. Captain Peddie's guns being all wet below, he coud only return him his quarter deck guns and &s;mall arms; but clapping the helm hard a-weather, he had the courage to run him aboard on the quarter, which did him con&s;iderable damage. When the Spaniard got clear, he &s;hot ahead and lay by a quarter of an hour, which gave the captain time to get ready for him; and on his bearing down again, a &s;mart engagement en&s;ued for about three hours and a half; when the Don bore away, and Captain Peddie after him; but finding he out&s;ailed him, he clapped upon a wind, and continued his voyage with a favoura|ble wind till he arrived in the Downs, October 30, having lo&s;t but four men and five wounded. After &s;o brave a deliverance he was &s;carcely anchored, before, by a violent &s;torm, his &s;hip was driven a &s;hore and lo&s;t; him&s;elf narrowly e&s;caping, and five of his crew having peri&s;hed with the cold. The gallant beha|viour of this Gentleman, and his &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the publick. On the 20th November 1740, CATO was acted at Covent Garden for his Benefit. His Maje&s;ty &s;ent him 100 Guineas, the Dutche&s;s of Marlbo|rough 20, and Mr. On&s;low, Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, with many of the Nobility, made him pre&s;ents to the value of near 3000 pounds. Soon after he had given him the Command of the Ba&s;ili&s;k Bomb. The above Song was written by Mr. Walm&s;ley, the patron of Mr. Garrick, and the friend of Doctor John&s;on, except the third Stanza, which was added by Mr. Garrick him&s;elf.</NOTE></HEAD>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Or, The POWER of RIOT:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AN ODE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In honour of the 25th and 26th of January, and 24th February, 1763.</HEAD>
<P>I AM a theatrical politician, and can talk as learnedly in my field of politics as you, or any of your corre&s;pondents, can do in your's. I can remember the day when a Gray's-Inn Journali&s;t, or a Herald, has mauled a manager weekly, as ably as the Monitor or the North Briton has lately attacked the Mini&s;ter. Some of your po|liticians allow Mr. Pitt to be a great man, but think he has been too fond of continental con|nections. In like manner, I not only allow Garrick to be the greate&s;t actor the world ever &s;aw, but al&s;o am of opinion that he is an excel|lent manager; and yet I mu&s;t, as a true patriot, blame him for his encouragement of pantomime. Two Pantomimes in one winter, and the town had only &s;en&s;e enough to damn one. O tempora! O mores! but I &s;hall conclude what I have to &s;ay at pre&s;ent, with taking notice, that the revo|lutions of theatres are as extraordinary as tho&s;e
<PB N="493" REF="270">
of &s;tates and republics; and tumults in king|doms are &s;carce attended with greater confu&s;ion than riots at the Playhou&s;e. On the&s;e occa&s;ions great patriots, theatrical and political, chiefly &s;hew them&s;elves. Hampden, who oppo&s;ed &s;hip|money, is not more celebrated than Thady Fitz|patrick, who demoli&s;hed full price. The fol|lowing poem is a parody on that celebrated ode of Dryden's, which that great orator, Mr. She|ridan, has &s;o often recited with uncommon ap|plau&s;e at Spring-gardens, Pewterers-hall, Drury|lane Theatre, Oxford, Cambridge, and Bath; and I mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h, that it were in my power to prevail with that gentleman to employ his noble powers of elocution on the following parody.</P>

<L>A &s;tate&s;man without pow'r, and without gall,</L>
<L>Hating no courtiers, happier than them all.</L>
<L>Bow'd to no yoke, nor crouching for applau&s;e,</L>

<L>Herds, flocks, and &s;miling Ceres deck our plain,</L>

<L>Of &s;portive children, frolick o'er the green:</L>
<L>Mean time, pure love looks on, and con&s;ecrates the &s;cene.</L>
<L>Come then, immortal &s;pirit of the &s;tage,</L>
<L>Great nature's proxy, gla&s;s of every age,</L>
<L>Come, ta&s;te the &s;imple life of patriarchs old,</L>
