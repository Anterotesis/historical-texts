<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF <HI>BARBAROSSA,</HI> The USURPER of <HI>ALGIERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_AS the Curio&s;ity of the Publick has been of late much engaged, in Enquiries after the NEW TRAGEDY of <HI>BARBA|ROSSA,</HI> which is &s;oon to be perform'd at the Theatre Royal in <HI>Drury-Lane;</HI> and as &s;everal Gentlemen of Eminence in the Republick of Letters have been men|tion'd
<PB N="6" REF="3">
as the Author, it may, perhaps, be agreeable to the Town, to have the fol|lowing &s;hort Account given of the previous Hi&s;tory of that fam'd U&s;urper, from whom the Tragedy takes it's Name.</P>
<P>While the memorable Cardinal XIMENEZ was Mini&s;ter in <HI>Spain,</HI> King FERDINAND the Fifth, of <HI>Arragon,</HI> about the Year 1505, &s;ent PETER, Count of <HI>Navarre,</HI> with a powerful Force; which, without Difficulty, took <HI>Oran.</HI> The Inhabitants of this fa|mous City in general were <HI>Moors,</HI> which had been forc'd out of <HI>Granada</HI> and <HI>Va|lentia,</HI> about twelve Years before.</P>
<P>The&s;e, being a bold and active People, and being well vers'd in the Manners, as well as Language of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> did con&s;iderable Damage, both by Sea and Land, to the Dependents of that Crown.</P>
<P>From <HI>Oran</HI> the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> flu&s;h'd with Succe&s;s, pur&s;u'd their Conque&s;t and took <HI>Bugia,</HI> and many other Places, with heroic Valour. The <HI>Algerines,</HI> being apprehen|&s;ive their City would undergo the &s;ame Fate, &s;ent for A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by Way of Cau|tion, to SELIM EUTEMI, a Prince of <HI>Arabian</HI> Extraction, famous for Skill in military Affairs. He accepted their In|vitation,
<PB N="7" REF="4">
and came with a large Number of valiant Followers, which he had &s;e|lected from that populous Nation, and encamp'd upon the Plain of <HI>Mutija,</HI> where he had Power; attended al&s;o by his Wife ZAPHIRA, a Lady of great Worth and Virtue, and his Son SELIM, not then twelve Years old, whom he was fond of initiating into the Exerci&s;e of War.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this Succour, another Fleet and more Troops from FERDINAND, quickly &s;ubdu'd the City of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and oblig'd it to pay Tribute; and even &s;uf|fer'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to build a Fort, and man it with &s;ome of the be&s;t Troops, on a &s;mall I&s;land, that lay oppo&s;ite the City, to the great Injury of the <HI>Algerine Cor&s;airs,</HI> who could not, with Safety, go out and in the Harbour.</P>
<P>This, however di&s;agreeable, they bore with Patience, 'till the Death of FER|DINAND in the Year 1516, which put them then upon an Attempt to recover their Liberties.</P>
<P>They &s;ent Deputies to ARACH BAR|BAROSSA, a <HI>Mahometan Cor&s;air,</HI> born at <HI>Mcteline</HI> in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> of great Fame for his Bravery and his Succe&s;s in
<PB N="8" REF="5">
Battle. He was upon a Crui&s;e with his Squardron, when the <HI>Algerine</HI> Deputies met him, with their Reque&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to throw off the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Yoke; promi&s;ing him great Dignities to his Per&s;on, and large Gratification for &s;uch Service. He gave the Deputies a mo&s;t favourable An&s;wer, and &s;ent them back to <HI>Algiers,</HI> to carry Joy to their dejected Country|men.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA immediately &s;ent eighteen Gallies, and a Number of Barks to <HI>Algiers,</HI> while he march'd by Land, collecting all the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> that &s;eem'd inclin'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Enterprize; and was &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|ful in his Levies, that the <HI>Algerines</HI> thought the Hour of Deliverance was at Hand.</P>
<P>SELIM EUTEMI, General of <HI>Algiers,</HI> with many of the chief Officers and princi|pal Citizens, went two Days Journey to meet him; and brought him, with great Honours, in Triumph into their City, con|ducting him, amid&s;t the Shouts of the Peo|ple, to the Palace of SELIM EUTEMI: Where he was nobly receiv'd, while his Army met with great Indulgence from the rejoic'd <HI>Algerines;</HI> which they &s;oon abus'd, and claim'd by Force, what was fir&s;t given them through Courte&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6">
BARBAROSSA too, being of an ambitious Nature, form'd a wicked De&s;ign of making him&s;elf Sovereign of <HI>Algiers,</HI> and all its Provinces. His Officers applauded his De|&s;ign, promis'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t in it, and &s;wore them&s;elves to Secrecy, 'till a Time happen'd to put it in Execution. In order to begin Commotions, BARBAROSSA wink'd at the In&s;olence and Villanies of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Sol|diers, who were perpetually rai&s;ing Di&s;or|ders in the City; which he hop'd might enrage the Citizens to &s;ome de&s;perate Act, that might favour his De&s;ign.</P>
<P>SELIM EUTEMI now di&s;cover'd his In|di&s;cretion, in calling BARBAROSSA in to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance: For, &s;o in&s;olent was this Pirate, that he treated the Prince with Con|tempt, never asking his Advice in any Thing; but built Forts, attack'd the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ca&s;tle, and all without his Knowledge or Con|&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Citizens too plainly perceiv'd his De&s;ign, and made no Scruple of declaring their Sentiments. BARBAROSSA, finding him&s;elf &s;u&s;pected, gave Way to his Fury; which was heighten'd by a Pa&s;&s;ion he had entertain'd for SELIM's Wife, the fair ZAPHIRA. He therefore determin'd
<PB N="10" REF="7">
to make &s;hort Work of it; and, by the Death of SELIM, &s;atisfy at once his Ambition and his Love: For he did not doubt but upon her Husband's Death, ZAPHIRA would li&s;ten to his Suit, and con&s;ent to marry him; which Alliance would add Dignity to him, and his own mean Extraction be hid by the Union with this Lady, who was related to mo&s;t of the powerful Cheques of the <HI>Arabians;</HI> who, if the <HI>Algerines</HI> &s;hould oppo&s;e, would, for his Wife's &s;ake, a&s;&s;i&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h him upon the Throne.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA, having fixt his Scheme, waited an Opportunity of SELIM's being alone in a Bath; when he ru&s;h'd upon him, and &s;lew him. He fell down in the Bath, where the Water fini&s;h'd what his Hurry had imperfectly done. The Pirate ha&s;ten'd out, and, collecting &s;ome of his Friends, return'd to the Bath, under Pre|tence of cooling him&s;elf as u&s;ual; where, with an affected Surprize, he &s;hew'd SELIM dead. This was &s;oon &s;pread throughout the City; and BARBAROSSA, under Pretence of di&s;covering any foul Play that might have been us'd to SELIM, put all the Soldiers under Arms, with Orders to &s;ecure every Pa&s;s, 'till he could con&s;ider further on this Accident.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="8">
The Citizens of <HI>Algiers,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Reports given out, look'd upon the Death of SELIM to be a Stroke of the inhuman BARBAROSSA's; and, dreading the further Mi&s;chief they &s;u&s;pected he had plan'd, lock'd them&s;elves in their Hou&s;es, which gave the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army full Power to di&s;tre&s;s and &s;poil at Plea&s;ure.&mdash;They immediately conducted BARBAROSSA in Pomp to SELIM's Palace, proclaiming him King of <HI>Algiers;</HI> adding, <HI>De&s;truction to all Oppo&s;ers of him, that Heaven has cho&s;en for our Deliverer and Protector.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Menaces alarm'd the Citizens with mo&s;t dreadful Apprehen&s;ions. BAR|BAROSSA was &s;eated under a Canopy, &s;urrounded with his Adherents and Guards, while proper Officers were &s;ent to the principal Inhabitants, requiring them, in the Name of the new King, to attend and take the Oath of Allegiance before him; promi&s;ing great Marks of Favour and Re|wards to tho&s;e, who &s;hew'd them&s;elves mo&s;t ready to perform the Ceremony. In this Exigency the Citizens, who apprehended immediate Death would follow their Refu&s;al, &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be brought to the Palace; where, after the King had repeated his magnificent Promi&s;es, they took the
<PB N="12" REF="9">
Oaths, and &s;ign'd the In&s;trument for his Coronation.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA, having thus far obtain'd his End, order'd the Inhabitants to go quietly about their &s;everal Callings, and depend upon his Care for their Protection. Prince SELIM's Son, with Rea&s;on, ap|prehending he was not long to &s;urvive his Father's Murder, found Means to fly, with only two Servants to <HI>Oran,</HI> and beg Protection from <HI>Spain.</HI> The Marquis DE GOMAREZ, Governor of the Place, re|ceiv'd him with all the Re&s;pect and Honour due to his Birth and Youth.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA, being thus &s;ettled on the Throne, caus'd all the Fortifications of <HI>Al|giers</HI> to be repair'd; and plac'd in them &s;trong Garri&s;ons of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Soldiers, whom he paid well with Money he had coin'd in his own Name.</P>
<P>The People &s;oon felt the Grievances of BARBAROSSA's U&s;urpation; for, where he had the lea&s;t Su&s;picion, he &s;eiz'd upon the Effects of the Subjects: Others, that had &s;ecreted their Money, were put to Death, while he and his A&s;&s;ociates revell'd in their Property.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="10">
While Affairs were in this Situation, BARBAROSSA began his Addre&s;&s;es to the Prince&s;s ZAPHIRA, who rejected them with the utmo&s;t Di&s;dain, for &s;he look'd upon him as the Murderer of her Husband; and expecting her Contempt of him would enrage him to attempt &s;ome Violence, &s;he always carry'd a Dagger with her; fully re&s;olv'd, if &s;he could not revenge her&s;elf on him, to &s;ave her Virtue at the Price of her own Life.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA, however furious by Na|ture, did not immediately re&s;ent ZA|PHIRA's Behaviour; but, looking on her exce&s;&s;ive Grief to proceed from her Hus|band's Death, re&s;olv'd to forbear his Vi&s;its for awhile, and let Time re&s;tore her Mind to Temper, when he did not doubt but to per&s;wade her to &s;hare his Crown.&mdash;He made her a Pre&s;ent of &s;ome beautiful Slaves, &s;ome of which were in&s;tructed to let him know what pa&s;s'd in the Prince&s;s's Apartment.</P>
<P>ZAPHIRA's Grief was too violent to continue, and her Tran&s;ports began to &s;et|tle into a compos'd and &s;ilent Sorrow. Reflection took Place, and, finding it im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="14" REF="11">
to revenge the Death of SELIM, &s;he re&s;olv'd to reque&s;t the U&s;urper to let her retire into her own Country.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA, hearing the Prince&s;s was grown more moderate in her Grief, &s;ent her a Letter, full of the highe&s;t Prai&s;es of her Beauty, and the Adoration he paid to it; offering to &s;hare his Crown with her, and be&s;eeching her to forget all former Mi&s;eries, and ri&s;e to Joy upon the Throne he wi&s;h'd her to adorn.</P>
<P>One of the Slaves, that BARBAROSSA had pre&s;ented the Prince&s;s with, was en|tru&s;ted to deliver this Letter to her; but what was her Surprize, when &s;he read the&s;e Offers made by one who was the Murderer of her Husband? All her former Agitations were renew'd; but at length, a little recol|lecting her&s;elf, &s;he con&s;ulted with her faith|ful Women how to behave in &s;uch a dread|ful Exigency. It was now re&s;olv'd, that &s;he &s;hould &s;end a &s;oothing An&s;wer back (as Rage would prove vain again&s;t Power) and, by flattering the Tyrant, obtain Per|mi&s;&s;ion to retire to the Plains of <HI>Mutija</HI> her native Country; and urge, for Rea&s;on of her refu&s;ing the Crown, her Dete&s;tatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Place where her Lord was mur|der'd.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="12">
BARBAROSSA found, by this Epi&s;tle, that &s;he &s;u&s;pected him as Acce&s;&s;ary to SELIM's Death; but, in order to clear him|&s;elf, and put an End to ZAPHIRA's Imagi|nations, he &s;ummon'd his chief Coun&s;ellor and In&s;trument in the Death of SELIM, RAMADAN CHOULAH, and told him, As the Prince&s;s &s;u&s;pected he was concern'd in the Prince's Murder, that, in order to ac|quit him&s;elf, he mu&s;t procure &s;ome Victims to turn ZAPHIRA's Thoughts.</P>
<P>RAMADAN ea&s;ily came into this Project; and order'd it to be proclaim'd, That the King, being inform'd that SELIM had a violent Death, and that he him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected to be privy to it, his Orders were that any Per&s;on who knew, or &s;u&s;pected the Murderers, &s;hould immediately di&s;cover them, on Pain of Death and Tortures; promi&s;ing, at the &s;ame Time, great Rewards to the Informer.</P>
<P>It was not long before an Informer, who had been practis'd upon, made a Di&s;covery. He declar'd, That a Dome&s;tic of Prince SELIM's had told him, before he left <HI>Algiers,</HI> the Names of the Accomplices; adding, that they were under an Oath to
<PB N="16" REF="13">
&s;uffer Death, rather than betray the Secret, if BARBAROSSA had mi&s;carried; but that he being at pre&s;ent the Sovereign, they had nothing to fear, though it &s;hould be publickly known. This Wretch, who was in the Prince's Service, receiv'd the Reward; but, at the &s;ame Time, the King order'd his Tongue to be pull'd out, under Pretence of his not revealing it &s;ooner, but indeed that he might not di&s;cover the Treachery.</P>
<P>The pretended Accomplices, to the Number of Thirty, were brought before the King, who were &s;ome of the poore&s;t Soldiers in BARBAROSSA's Army; and had been wrought upon by RAMADAN, in order to clear the King, publickly to con&s;e&s;s them&s;elves guilty, a&s;&s;uring them of great Rewards for the Service; and tho' they &s;hould be put in Pri&s;on, yet Means &s;hould be found to convey them &s;afe to <HI>Aegypt,</HI> to &s;pend their Lives in Peace and Plenty.</P>
<P>The&s;e poor Men could not re&s;i&s;t &s;uch Promi&s;es, but con&s;ented; and, when they were call'd upon, an&s;wer'd to every Que&s;|tion, and own'd their Guilt, upon which they were immediately &s;trangled. One of them, out of Revenge to RAMADAN, who
<PB N="17" REF="14">
had &s;o deluded them, cry'd out before he dy'd, <HI>That Prince</HI> SELIM <HI>was murder'd, by the Order of</HI> RAMADAN; whom the King order'd that In&s;tant to meet the &s;ame Fate, the other Wretches had &s;uffer'd. Thus did this wicked Man fall by his own Contrivance, and was de&s;troy'd by that Power which he had been the chief In|&s;trument to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>BARBAROSSA had the Bodies of the&s;e Wretches drag'd round the City, and their Heads fixt upon the Battlements of the Palace; and did not doubt, but the Con|fe&s;&s;ions of the&s;e Criminals would convince ZAPHIRA, as well as all the Citizens, that he was innocent of Prince SELIM's Death: And, indeed, many acquitted him of being any Ways concern'd in the Murder.</P>
<P>With this A&s;&s;urance, he &s;ent again to the Prince&s;s, again invited her to his Throne; and pleaded, as &s;ome Merit, the Di&s;covery he had made of SELIM's Murderers, and the Ju&s;tice he had executed upon them.</P>
<P>But ZAPHIRA was too penetrating to be &s;o deceiv'd. She again refus'd his
<PB N="18" REF="15">
Offers; adding, His Power could not be|&s;tow any Thing worth her Acceptance, un|le&s;s it was the Liberty of retiring to her own Country.</P>
<P>This Intercour&s;e of a&s;&s;iduous Court&s;hip and &s;teady Refu&s;al, continu'd by Fits for &s;ome Years; during which Time, BAR|BAROSSA was frequently call'd from <HI>Algiers</HI> by his Ambition, in defending the Territories he had u&s;urped, and inlarging them by new Conque&s;ts. In the mean Time, having got Notice that young SELIM had taken Refuge in <HI>Oran,</HI> he &s;ecretly di&s;patch'd a bold A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who &s;hould de&s;troy the young Prince, whom he regarded as the greate&s;t Ob&s;tacle to his &s;afe Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne.</P>
<P>While this De&s;ign was in Agitation he return'd triumphant over his Enemies to <HI>Algiers,</HI> and, being at once tired and pro|voked with ZAPHIRA's repeated Delays, he now bethought him&s;elf of u&s;ing that Power he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and re&s;olved, in Ca&s;e of another Refu&s;al, to compel her to a Marriage.</P>
<P>Somewhere about this Period, if ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Accounts are true, the Tragedy begins

How the Poet may conduct his Plan, or what U&s;e he may make of the&s;e Ma|terials, we pre&s;ume not to conjecture: Nor indeed, if we were acquainted with his De&s;ign, would we anticipate the Spectator's Plea&s;ure, by making it publick&mdash;But, by the Policy of the Managers, the Con|duct of this Tragedy is as much a Secret, as either the Name of the Author, or the &s;ub&s;equent Part of the Hi&s;tory it&s;elf.</P>
