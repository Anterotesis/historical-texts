<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be depended upon, that the following piece appeals more to Facts than Fancy; however &s;trong the Colouring may appear, un|attach'd judgement will pronounce it not exaggerated; the Author has particularly dwelt on &s;ordid Management, as that is the polluted &s;ource of all Theatrical dullne&s;s and deficiency: Mr GARRICK is exceedingly blameable, and, therefore, particularly noticed. About the time he got a &s;hare in Drury-Lane Patent, our pre&s;ent Laureat wrote him a letter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> 2d Volume of DODSLEY's Collection of POEMS.</NOTE> in which, among other pa&s;&s;ages, we find Thalia &s;peaking thus:
<Q><L>No more the poor polluted &s;cene</L>
<L>Shall teem with births of Harlequin;</L>
<L>Or vindicated &s;tage &s;hall feel</L>
<L>The in&s;ults of the dancer's heel;</L>
<L>Such idle tra&s;h we'll kindly &s;pare</L>
<L>To Op'ras now: they'll want them there.</L></Q>
Afterwards, addre&s;&s;ing Mr. Garrick, the poet &s;ays:
<Q><L>Con&s;ult your own good &s;en&s;e in all,</L>
<L>Be deaf to Fa&s;hion's fickle call;</L>
<L>Nor e'er de&s;cend to rea&s;on's laws</L>
<L>To court, what you command, applau&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>How far Ro&s;cius has fulfilled the prophecy, or con&s;ulted his own DISINTERESTED good &s;en&s;e, experience &s;adly tells. Some hireling news-paper friends &s;ay, if the public will follow &s;uch tra&s;h, the ma|nagers are right to furni&s;h it; but will common &s;en&s;e allow, that tho&s;e
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
public purveyors &s;hould, like common pro&s;titutes, be allowed to pick young and unwary pockets by fal&s;e glaring colours. Public complaint has been loud; yet the tide of avarice and folly mo&s;t audaciou&s;ly flows on.&mdash;The theatres have been likened to taverns, where, if you don't like the provi&s;ion or wines, you may &s;tay away, or go to another; true; but there are MANY taverns; only TWO theatres: a <HI>third</HI> of the latter, would make e&s;&s;ential difference; allow a &s;mall anecdote: QUEEN ELIZABETH, having received remarkable in&s;tances of ardent loyalty from a &s;mall country town, &s;aid; if they would a&s;k any rea|&s;onable grant, in her power, they &s;hould be indulged. Licence for an alehou&s;e was the demand. Surpri&s;ed, me a&s;ked the rea&s;on; becau&s;e, &s;aid they, we have but one, and they give us &s;uch wretched tra&s;h we can't drink it; if there was another, emulation would produce us &s;omething worth money: the application is obvious.</P>
<P>One half the money, that either INSTALLATION has co&s;t, nightly extra expences included, would have genteely paid Mr. MOSSOP, who is intrin&s;ically worth a thou&s;and &s;uch Chri&s;tmas-Holliday Pro|ductions.</P>
<P>As to the performers, we know they, like a ne&s;t of di&s;turbed hor|nets, will buzz and whet their &s;tings; it will be called cruelty to attack bread; how ab&s;urd an a&s;&s;ertion: if a &s;hoemaker, or taylor, executes, what he is paid for, badly, have not cu&s;tomers a right to complain? nothing is more true than the following lines of CHUR|CHILL, with which we &s;hall conclude;
<Q><L>The &s;tage I chu&s;e&mdash;a &s;ubject fair and free;</L>
<L>'Tis your's&mdash;'tis mine&mdash;'tis public property:</L>
<L>All public exhibitions open lie,</L>
<L>To prai&s;e, or cen&s;ure, of the public eye.</L></Q></P>
