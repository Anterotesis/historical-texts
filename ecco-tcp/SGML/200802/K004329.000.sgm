<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS the following Play comes into the World under &s;ome Di&s;advantage, I am happy in your Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;helter it under your Name.</P>
<P>BUT though it did not &s;tand in need of your Favour and Patronage upon many Accounts; yet it &s;hould be re|membred, that, in point of Propriety, you have an undoubted Right to the&s;e Sheets, whether you are con&s;idered as a Per&s;on &s;incerely attached to the Uni|ver&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> or particularly in|tere&s;ting
<PB REF="3">
your&s;elf in the Welfare of <HI>Pembroke-College;</HI> to the Regard and Affection of which Society you have a double Claim, both as an Ornament, and a Benefactor.</P>
<P>THE common Topics of Panegyric are obvious; and I have here a fair and agreeable Opportunity of taking Notice of tho&s;e many amiable Qualities, which adorn you in public and private Life, and for which you are &s;o ju&s;tly beloved and e&s;teemed: But my In|clination is corrected by a &s;ea&s;onable Thought, that mo&s;t Writers of the pre|&s;ent Age have, in this re&s;pect, a parti|cular Advantage over me, as it is infi|nitely more ea&s;y to make a Character, than to de&s;cribe one.</P>
<P>BESIDES, it would be needle&s;s to en|ter into a Detail of tho&s;e Prai&s;es, which are already in the Mouth of every Well|wi&s;her to his Country: But I cannot re&s;i&s;t the Impul&s;e of Gratitude, which points to that Part of your Character, which more immediately affects me;
<PB REF="4">
your Good-nature and Conde&s;cen&s;ion, to which I am indebted for the Ho|nour of your Acquaintance and Friend|&s;hip, and for your favourable Accept|ance of the following Poem.</P>
<P>GIVE me Leave to a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that if I am anxious for the Fate of this Tragedy, one principal Motive for it, is, the amu&s;ing Hope of tran&s;mitting to Po&s;terity a Monument of the Regard and Veneration I have for the Per&s;on and Character of Sir JOHN PHILIPPS. I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> 
<SIGNED>Your much obliged, And mo&s;t humble Servant,
WILLIAM HAWKINS.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS TRAGEDY having been offered to the Managers of <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI> Theatre, who de|clined accepting it, for Rea&s;ons which ap|peared to the Author to be rather eva&s;ive, than &s;ati&s;|factory, he thinks proper to &s;ubmit it to the Judg|ment of the Public: And as he is not con&s;cious of having had the lea&s;t Intention to give Offence, and no particular Pa&s;&s;age has been excepted again&s;t, he begs no other Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in its Favour, on this Account, than the rea&s;onable Allowances of a can|did and impartial Di&s;po&s;ition. The Play has indeed received &s;ome con&s;iderable Alterations &s;ince it came from Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Hands: But, as the&s;e Altera|tions have no manner of Connexion with what the Author pre&s;umes was the principal Objection to the Whole (for, having had no clear Intimation, he can only &s;peak by Conjecture), he does not think him|&s;elf obliged to explain him&s;elf further on that Head.</P>
