<Q>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children, I will pre&s;erve them alive, and let thy widows tru&s;t in me.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;uperintendency of divine providence over all the affairs of mankind, is a point &s;o fully proved by experi|ence, that it is &s;eldom called in que&s;tion, but by the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s and abandoned. The great di&s;po&s;er of all things hath, in various parts of holy writ, graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed his kind interpo&s;ition, to counteract the de&s;igns and oppre&s;&s;ions of men; in a more e&s;pecial manner hath he frequently declared to aid and protect tho&s;e who &s;tand mo&s;t in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; to be
<PB N="6" REF="4">
the <HI>father of the fatherle&s;s,</HI> and to <HI>defend the cau&s;e of the wi|dow; to deliver the poor that cry, and him that hath none to help him.</HI> On this comfortable a&s;&s;urance we may &s;afely rely, un|der all our plagues, &s;orrows, and calamities; for <HI>God is not a man that he &s;hould lie, or the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent: hath he &s;aid, and &s;hall he not do it: hath he &s;poken, and &s;hall he not make it good?</HI></P>
<P>Leave thy fatherle&s;s children, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I will pre&s;erve them, and let thy widows tru&s;t in me.</P>
<P>Now, though the&s;e words were at fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed to a parti|cular nation, the promi&s;e contained in them doth mo&s;t certainly extend to all the &s;ons of men, and may, I think, with the ut|mo&s;t propriety, be applied to the occa&s;ion of this day's &s;olemnity, when we are met to commemorate, &s;upport, and encourage an in&s;titution, rai&s;ed up, and in&s;pired by the providence of God, in favour of his cho&s;en &s;ervants and mini&s;ters, the per&s;ecuted di&s;|ciples and followers of his beloved Son; who, as I &s;hall endeavour in the following di&s;cour&s;e more fully to prove, could not po&s;&s;ibly have carried on the great ta&s;k allotted them, without the mani|fe&s;t and frequent interpo&s;ition of divine providence exerted in their favour.</P>
<P>THERE is not perhaps, upon the face of the earth, any order of men, much le&s;s the teachers and preachers of any religion,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
&s;o poorly and &s;o contemptuou&s;ly treated as the regular and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed clergy of the church of England: provided for in a man|ner &s;o inadequate to their &s;ervices, &s;o unworthy of their dignity, &s;o un&s;uitable to the u&s;e and importance of their profe&s;&s;ion: the little patrimony allotted to them, is &s;o unequally divided, that whil&s;t a few, a very few, are adorned, rewarded, loaded with dignities and preferments, all the re&s;t are either confined within the pale of bare competency and &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; or, which is more generally the ca&s;e, langui&s;hing in vile ob&s;curity, and reduced to the utmo&s;t &s;treights of penury and di&s;tre&s;s, obliged at the &s;ame time to contribute out of their &s;canty revenues, in as large a pro|portion to all the exigencies of the &s;tate, as tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes are entailed on their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>IN a country where chri&s;tianity, in its pure&s;t form, is univer&s;ally profe&s;&s;ed; where the obligations, which the civil power lyeth un|der to the influence of religion, is every day acknowledged; where the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the very learned and ingenious Dr. Warburton (now bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter's) ALLI|ANCE BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE, one of the mo&s;t excellent and &s;pirited performances in the Engli&s;h language.</NOTE>church is &s;o &s;erviceable to the &s;tate, it is a&s;toni&s;hing that the &s;tate &s;hould be &s;o forgetful of the church; that it &s;hould have made no public parliamentary provi&s;ion for the widows and or|phans of a body of men, to whom it is &s;o greatly indebted for its &s;afety and pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6" MS="y">
THE clergy have withal the heavier cau&s;e of complaint, as they are perhaps almo&s;t the only per&s;ons, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es have not at &s;ome time or other engaged the general attention. A kind and nece&s;&s;ary relief hath, we know, been provided for the wi|dows of tho&s;e who hazard their lives in the defence of their country; the &s;tate, no doubt, wi&s;ely con&s;idering, that tho&s;e, who generou&s;ly &s;acrificed their private happine&s;s and comfort to the good and welfare of the community, had an inconte&s;table right to public favour and protection; that, however warmly attached the gallant officer might be to his king and country, the ties of nature might &s;till prevail; that deep care and anxiety for the intere&s;t and &s;afety of a beloved wife might unnerve the &s;tronge&s;t arm, and depre&s;s the brave&s;t heart; that, on the other hand, the &s;atisfaction of leaving her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a moderate com|petency, might &s;mooth the rugged paths of danger, and animate him in the pur&s;uit of glory That a&s;&s;i&s;tance therefore, which, though imperfect, the legi&s;lature have here afforded, is noble and prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>BUT, whil&s;t tho&s;e who fight the battles of earthly princes, and vindicate the cau&s;e of men, are thus beneficently and piou&s;ly re|membered, the &s;oldiers of Chri&s;t, the champions of the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI> are neglected and forgotten: is there nothing due to tho&s;e who guard the principles, and watch over the morals of a na|tion; nothing to the in&s;tructors of our youth, and the advocates
<PB N="9" REF="7">
of our religion; to them who check the progre&s;s of incroaching vice, and cheri&s;h the blo&s;&s;oms of ri&s;ing virtue? In <HI>our</HI> army, mu&s;t the generals alone enjoy all the honour and all the profit in our triumphs over athei&s;m and infidelity, and no civic crown be given, as of old, to the private &s;oldier, to him who defends with bravery the cau&s;e of his divine Ma&s;ter, bears the &s;hield of faith, and fights the battles of the Almighty?</P>
<P>If the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath any thing in it &s;acred or re|&s;pectable; if it has a right to command deference and veneration from tho&s;e who profe&s;s and embrace it, &s;urely the preachers and teachers of that religion, the mini&s;ters and di&s;pen&s;ers of God's holy word and &s;acraments, have a title to &s;ome regard and e&s;teem among&s;t men; if they perform their duty, as worthy and con&s;cientious &s;er|vants, for their ma&s;ter's &s;ake, they de&s;erve &s;ome degree of re&s;pect, &s;ome regard for their welfare, &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for their misfor|tunes, &s;ome relief of their nece&s;&s;ities. But it is too truly and univer|&s;ally ob&s;erved, that the clergy have of late years fallen into mo&s;t unde&s;erved neglect and contempt; even the poor tribute of external re&s;pect, formerly paid to their character and function, is with|drawn from them, and the &s;acred order it&s;elf treated by too many as an object of ridicule: a conduct, partly owing to the low and indigent &s;tate of many of our unfortunate brethren, and partly, I believe, to the dangerous influence acquired over the minds of the multitude by our new &s;ectaries and enthu&s;ia&s;ts,
<PB N="10" REF="8">
who make it their chief bu&s;ine&s;s to in&s;pire their followers with an utter abhorrence and contempt of us.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe the mi&s;eries and di&s;tre&s;&s;es that attend the lower part of the clergy, would pre&s;ent a picture to your eyes too gloomy and terrible to behold. Let us then, the better to illu&s;trate and confirm the melancholy truth before a&s;&s;erted, &s;elect one from the middle rank, one of tho&s;e happy few, whom &s;ome lucky incident, the favour of &s;ome powerful friend, or the beneficence of &s;ome kind relation hath advanced to what is generally termed a good living <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">More than one half what are called <HI>Livings</HI> are under 50 l. a Year, and near one fourth part under 20 l. See Ecton and other authors on this &s;ubject.</NOTE>; let us &s;uppo&s;e him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a moderate income, and ble&s;&s;ed in the comforts and conveniences of life; even this much envied &s;tation, which &s;o many look up to with an eye of hopele&s;s de|&s;ire, is by no means &s;o eligible as we may be at fir&s;t inclined to think it. Excluded by the nature of his function, by laws and &s;tatutes, which he is bound to obey, from all farther views of intere&s;t or advantage in any other profe&s;&s;ion; &s;hut out from every other avenue to riches and independency, and confined to the narrow path which he is obliged to tread in; defrauded, perhaps, of half his &s;canty pittance, by perver&s;e and litigious men, and compelled either to &s;acrifice a part of his legal rights,
<PB N="11" REF="9">
or the whole of his much dearer peace and tranquillity, obliged to act in all things agreeably to his rank and character; to main|tain in his habit, appearance, and conver&s;ation, the decency and dignity of his profe&s;&s;ion, to live with &s;ome degree of ta&s;te and elegance &s;uitable to his education and connections, and to join his richer brethren in all the acts of charity, ho&s;pitality, and be|neficence required of him; his family and expences increa&s;ing, his means to &s;upport them at be&s;t continuing the &s;ame, perhaps every year dimini&s;hing; unable to guard again&s;t arts which he is incapable of practi&s;ing, or to &s;truggle with difficulties which he has never experienced; he &s;inks by &s;low and in&s;en&s;ible degrees into poverty, de&s;pondency, and de&s;pair; &s;coffed at, de&s;pi&s;ed, and trampled on by every other order of men, and, which is &s;till more grating, it may be, treated with contempt, in&s;olence, and op|pre&s;&s;ion, by the &s;uperiors of his own.</P>
<P>IF to all the&s;e bitter and galling calamities, he adds al&s;o the melancholy reflection, that tho&s;e who are neare&s;t and deare&s;t to him, the wife of his bo&s;om, and the children of his loins, hang but on the &s;lender thread of his life, and depend on that alone for their maintainance and &s;upport; that the moment it &s;hall plea&s;e the Almighty to take him hence, they mu&s;t change the plea&s;ing &s;cene of dome&s;tic happine&s;s and comfort; all the conveniencies of moderate competency, for a di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of penury and de|pendance;
<PB N="12" REF="10">
every misfortune heightened by their reflections on lo&s;t happine&s;s; every &s;orrow embittered by the cruel remem|brance of pa&s;t felicity. Under the&s;e gloomy and dreadful ap|prehen&s;ions, what &s;hall &s;upport him in his labours, what &s;hall animate him in the chearful exerci&s;e of his function, remove his fears, and le&s;&s;en his affliction, but the firm confidence in, and re|liance on, his divine ma&s;ter, who&s;e eyes are ever watchful to guard and protect his &s;ons and &s;ervants; who hath promi&s;ed to be a <HI>fa|ther to the fatherle&s;s, and to defend the cau&s;e of his widow:</HI> were it not indeed for this comfortable a&s;&s;urance, he mu&s;t inevitably &s;ink beneath the weight of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>To mitigate the rigor of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to &s;often the pre&s;&s;ure of the&s;e calamities, is the bu&s;ine&s;s which has this day called us together. Thanks be to God, the defects of the whole com|munity have been &s;upplied by the genero&s;ity of individuals, and the evils ari&s;ing from public par&s;imony in a great mea&s;ure re|moved by private beneficence.</P>
<P>AMONGST all the fair daughters of charity that adorn this bene|volent nation, and &s;hine forth as the <HI>poli&s;hed corners of the temple,</HI> there is not one who&s;e charms are more &s;triking, who&s;e beauties are more attractive, than the noble and excellent in&s;titution which we are this day met to encourage and &s;upport. A de&s;ign, which, in &s;pite of all the attempts that have been made to &s;ub|vert,
<PB N="13" REF="11">
and all the arts which have been practiced to undermine and de&s;troy it, hath hitherto an&s;wered the warme&s;t wi&s;hes of its friends, and defeated the malice of its enemies: like that reli|gion who&s;e cau&s;e it e&s;pou&s;es, and who&s;e mini&s;ters it relieves, it is <HI>built upon a rock,</HI> even <HI>the rock of Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>can never fail.</HI></P>
<P>THE excellent charity now under our con&s;ideration doth naturally addre&s;s it&s;elf to three orders of men, namely, the <HI>laity,</HI> the <HI>&s;uperior,</HI> and the <HI>inferior clergy;</HI> what claim it may with ju&s;tice lay to protection and &s;upport from each of them, will perhaps appear more evident from the following con&s;ide|rations.</P>
<P>THERE was a time, when the &s;ecular intere&s;ts of the clergy and <HI>laity</HI> of this kingdom were entirely &s;eparate, and di&s;tinct from each other: in the days of popery and &s;uper&s;tition, the clergy received great and manifold advantages from the commu|nity, and returned nothing to it; that celibacy, which brought &s;hame and di&s;grace on them&s;elves, was attended al&s;o with the mo&s;t pernicious effects to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BY the reformation, this wall was broken down; the holy in&s;ti|tution of marriage, which had been long with-held, and was now re&s;tored to the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, opened a &s;ocial intercour&s;e and free communication between them, which was &s;oon produc|tive of the greate&s;t benefits and advantages to the common-weal.
<PB N="14" REF="12">
The clergy, notwith&s;tanding, who by their labours and a&s;&s;i|duity in the cau&s;e of truth, had been the chief in&s;truments in perfecting that noble and &s;alutary work, were them&s;elves (with re&s;pect to temporal affairs) the lea&s;t gainers by it; they, who had freed others, continued &s;till in a &s;tate of bondage, and groaning beneath the yoke of penury and oppre&s;&s;ion; the lands and reve|nues which had been unju&s;tly wre&s;ted from them, in&s;tead of be|ing re&s;tored, were lavi&s;hed away by a licentious and de&s;potic &s;o|vereign, among&s;t his greedy courtiers and dependents, and the clergy left from that time, even unto this day, the &s;ad and re|proachful monuments of public ingratitude.</P>
<P>YOU, my brethren of the laity, received the benefits of the reformation, whil&s;t they, and they alone, who had be&s;t de&s;erved the reward, were unju&s;tly and uncharitably deprived of it: on you, therefore, it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure incumbent to repair the injury, and as you contributed to our poverty, to relieve the in|conveniencies and di&s;tre&s;&s;es ari&s;ing from it.</P>
<P>TO tho&s;e among&s;t the laity, who are de&s;cended from the clergy, I am &s;atisfied, it is needle&s;s to add any exhortation: their noble and liberal contributions, their unwearied pains and a&s;&s;i|duity, their chearful acceptance of that expen&s;ive office, which they &s;o readily every year take upon them, with their con&s;tant appearance at this &s;olemnity, do mo&s;t abundantly te&s;tify their
<PB N="15" REF="13">
good-will, tenderne&s;s, and affection towards us. So far are they from being a&s;hamed of their birth and origin, that they openly and zealou&s;ly proclaim it, &s;tanding forth with joy and alacrity in the defence and &s;upport of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and unfortunate bre|thren. There are indeed among&s;t them &s;o many of high rank and fortune, that a partial ob&s;erver might be almo&s;t tempted to doubt the truth of what hath been before advanced, and to ima|gine, that the &s;ons of the clergy, far from being the mo&s;t indi|gent and oppre&s;&s;ed, are the riche&s;t and happie&s;t of men; but this would, notwith&s;tanding, be a fal&s;e and ill-grounded conclu&s;ion; as mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The brave Admiral <HI>Pocock,</HI> Joint-conqueror of the <HI>Havannah,</HI> mo&s;t generou&s;ly contri|buted one hundred guineas towards the &s;upport of this charity on the fea&s;t-day; as did al&s;o <HI>John Thornton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the &s;tewards for the pre&s;ent year.</NOTE>ample fortunes enable them &s;o generou&s;ly to contribute to this charity, are not indebted to the church for their affluence, not to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments of their fa|thers, but either to their family e&s;tates and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions&punc; or to their own indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s in more lucrative profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;uperior clergy</HI> of the church of England, enjoy many and great temporal advantages; &s;ome of them bear a part in the le|gi&s;lature of the kingdom; others, by their rank and dignity, their fortunes and preferments, are enabled to a&s;&s;ociate with, and con|&s;equently, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to influence and direct the rich and
<PB N="16" REF="14">
great. Honour and re&s;pect, ea&s;e and affluence, all the good, and all the de&s;irable things of this life are in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but of all their valuable pre-eminences, doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t to be envied, is their exten&s;ive power of doing good, the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting and relieving their indigent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren.</P>
<P>A GENEROUS contribution towards the &s;upport and encourage|ment of this peculiar branch of chri&s;tian charity, may be con&s;i|dered in others as an act of kindne&s;s, humanity, and benevolence, but with regard to them it is certainly a debt; a debt of honour, a debt of gratitude, a debt of piety, which they are bound by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties, punctually, faithfully, and religiou&s;ly to perform.</P>
<P>WHEN indeed they con&s;ider, as no doubt they do, and mu&s;t con&s;ider, that <HI>the more is given, the more will be required;</HI> that whil&s;t their fellow-&s;ervants (for fellow-&s;ervants we all are, and fellow-labourers we ought to be) are toiling in the vineyard of Chri&s;t, and bearing the <HI>heat and burthen of the day,</HI> their happier lot has exempted them from all the bitter hard&s;hips and cruel in|dignities incident to their profe&s;&s;ion; indignities which few know or attend to, but tho&s;e who feel and experience them:&mdash;that while their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed brethren, the inferior part of the clergy, are lamenting their unfortunate condition, and trembling at the melancholy pro&s;pect of future mi&s;eries, they are looking
<PB N="17" REF="15">
forward towards the honours, and dignities, the riches, afflu|ence and happine&s;s of their po&s;terity. With what grateful hearts &s;hould they acknowledge the goodne&s;s of that divine Be|ing, who hath <HI>ca&s;t</HI> their <HI>lot into &s;o fair a ground,</HI> and <HI>given them &s;uch a goodly heritage:</HI> doubtle&s;s, in proportion to their advantages, &s;hould be their benevolence, in proportion to their abundance, &s;hould be their genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>TO the <HI>inferior clergy,</HI> I have only to add, that the cau&s;e, which we are here pleading, is peculiarly their own, and that it would be highly unrea&s;onable in them to expect, that others will aid or a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who will not help them&s;elves. If they <HI>ca&s;t their bread on</HI> the&s;e waters, they may <HI>find it</HI> again <HI>after many days.</HI> Such indeed is the uncertainty of all human ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o va|rious are the changes and chances of human life, that thou&s;ands, who are not now in that &s;tate or condition, which can entitle them to a part or portion of this charity, who now give freely, without the lea&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of receiving, may yet one day be indebted to it for the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e who &s;hall here|after be dear unto them, of widows yet un&s;een, and children yet unborn.</P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e, to whom I am now addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, are too well acquainted with the difficulties and di&s;appointments, the &s;orrows and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, all the dangers which accompany their
<PB N="18" REF="16">
&s;piritual warfare, not to make u&s;e of every method in their power, to lighten, if po&s;&s;ible, the general burden. Tho&s;e, who have &s;marted beneath the rod of affliction, are &s;eldom in&s;en&s;ible to the mi&s;eries of others; they have hearts ever ready to com|pa&s;&s;ionate, hands ever open to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their fel|low-creatures.</P>
<P>FROM the pious de&s;igns and zealous endeavours of the&s;e men, the charity I am here recommending is indebted for its origin and foundation; to this they have always chearfully contri|buted, in proportion to their &s;everal abilities: the&s;e little rivulets have, from time to time, &s;upplied and repleni&s;hed that large and copious &s;tream which glideth through our fertile &s;oil, ble&s;&s;eth our earth with increa&s;e, and <HI>watereth the furrows thereof.</HI></P>
<P>TO conclude therefore by an earne&s;t exhortation to this whole a&s;&s;embly;</P>
<P>AS we have begun, let us endeavour to perfect this labour of love: let us remember, that tho&s;e, who&s;e cau&s;e we are now pleading, were &s;tewards and di&s;pen&s;ers of the my&s;teries of God, and that their names are worthy to be had in remembrance. Let us remember, that whil&s;t upon earth, their prayers were &s;ent up to God for our welfare, their faculties dedicated to our &s;ervice, their hours employed in the pious endeavours to promote our true happine&s;s, and en&s;ure our everla&s;ting &s;alvation. Many
<PB N="19" REF="17">
of tho&s;e, who&s;e widows and children now &s;olicit our bounty, were them&s;elves kind and con&s;tant contributors to this charity: in proportion to their abilities, they threw in their mite, <HI>not grudgingly,</HI> or <HI>of nece&s;&s;ity, but as chearful givers.</HI>&mdash;What they be&s;towed on others, they have doubtle&s;s a right, when they &s;tand in need of it, to demand for them&s;elves: <HI>he that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and look, what he layeth out, it &s;hall be paid him again.</HI>&mdash;Let us imagine, the parents of tho&s;e orphans, the widows of tho&s;e hu&s;bands, for whom we are now &s;oliciting, &s;till pre&s;ent before us; let us imagine them with their la&s;t breath, bequeathing to us the dear pledges of their love, and the objects of their affection, imploring us, by all the tender ties of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion, by our enjoyment of pre&s;ent bli&s;s, and all our hopes of future happine&s;s, to <HI>vi&s;it the fa|therle&s;s and widow in their affliction,</HI> to relieve their nece&s;&s;ities, mitigate their &s;orrows, and alleviate, if po&s;&s;ible, their terrible misfortunes.</P>
<P>CONSIDERABLE as the &s;ub&s;criptions have been to this excel|lent in&s;titution, they are &s;till found in&s;ufficient.
