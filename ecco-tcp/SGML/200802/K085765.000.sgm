<HEAD TYPE="sub">I &s;hall go to <HI>Him,</HI> but he &s;hall not return unto <HI>Me.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>DAVID,</HI> who in the general cour&s;e and tenor of his life, had by his piety and virtue recommended him&s;elf to the favour and acceptance of the Almighty, was by the in|dulgence of an unlawful pa&s;&s;ion betray'd into the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime which mo&s;t de&s;ervedly call'd down upon him the divine di&s;plea&s;ure. God notwith&s;tanding, who in the mid&s;t of his wrath remembered mercy, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed on his &s;incere repentance to &s;pare the life of the royal &s;inner, and for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to his &s;upreme wi&s;dom to puni&s;h him in the death of his child.</P>
<P><HI>THE Lord, &s;ays the prophet</HI> Samuel, &s;trake the child that <HI>Uriah's</HI> wife bare unto <HI>David,</HI> and it was very &s;ick. <HI>David</HI> therefore be&s;ought God for the child, and <HI>David</HI> fa&s;ted, and went in,
<PB N="4" REF="4">
and lay all night upon the earth, neither would he eat bread. And it came to pa&s;s on the &s;eventh day that the child dy'd.</P>
<P><HI>THEN David</HI> aro&s;e from the earth, and anoint|ed him&s;elf, and came into the hou&s;e of the Lord, and they &s;et bread before him and he did eat.</P>
<P><HI>AND when his &s;ervants &s;eem'd &s;urpris'd at this change of behaviour,</HI> he &s;aid unto them, while the child was yet alive, I fa&s;ted and wept: for I &s;aid, who can tell whether God will be gracious unto me, that the child may live?</P>
<P><HI>BUT</HI> now he is dead, wherefore &s;hould I fa&s;t? Can I bring him back again?</P>
<P>I &s;hall go to him, but he &s;hall not return unto me.</P>
<P>WHEN the afflicted parent began to reflect, that to indulge his &s;orrows for the lo&s;s of his beloved child would only be fruitle&s;s and unavailing, and that his grief in&s;tead of removing, could on|ly increa&s;e the calamity, he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf in all humility to the divine di&s;pen&s;ation; he con&s;i|der'd that his &s;ighs could not recall, nor his tears re&s;tore, what he lamented; and that it was therefore his duty to re&s;ign <HI>his</HI> will, and acknow|ledge a <HI>&s;uperior one.</HI> To re&s;ume that po&s;t which
<PB N="5" REF="5">
he had for&s;aken, to perform that part which the creator had allotted to him, and tho&s;e &s;ocial of|fices to which he was appointed; he comforts him&s;elf with the conviction that a time wou'd come when they &s;hould meet again, when God &s;hould call him to another &s;tate, and that in the mean time he had &s;omething to do in this. <HI>I &s;hall go to him,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>but he &s;hall not return unto me.</HI></P>
<P>THE conduct and behaviour of <HI>David</HI> on this occa&s;ion, may, when we are involved in the like calamity demand our prai&s;e, and merit our imitation.</P>
<P>A decent &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of our departed friends, as it is the natural production of a feel|ing heart, is not only pardonable, but meritorious, if kept within the bounds of prudence, and war|ranted by the dictates of religion and virtue. But if we &s;uffer it to interfere with our duty, to clog the wheels of life, and prevent the di&s;charge of tho&s;e offices which we were &s;ent into this world to perform, it then becometh highly culpable.</P>
<P>IN a world where we are liable to &s;o many temptations, &s;orrow is indeed but too often ne|ce&s;&s;ary to call off our attachment to it, to remind us of our &s;tate and condition here, to wean our
<PB N="6" REF="6">
affections from things below, and fix them on that better and more durable &s;tate, where only <HI>true joys are to be found.</HI></P>
<P>OF all tho&s;e u&s;eful monitors of mankind which from age to age have enlighten'd an ignorant, or refin'd a corrupt world, &s;o profitable an in|&s;tructor hath never yet been found as Death. This great and univer&s;al teacher aboundeth every day in the wi&s;e&s;t le&s;&s;ons of morality, he &s;peaks in a language to be under&s;tood by all, appeals in the mo&s;t pathetic manner to our &s;en&s;es, and &s;trikes deep into our hearts; but his admonitions are always more effectual, when he appeareth clothed as it were in his bloody garment, and affrights us with more than ordinary terrors, when he cometh as the &s;cripture &s;aith, <HI>like an armed man,</HI> when on a &s;udden he invades the palaces of health, or throws down the gaudy &s;tructures of youth and beauty.</P>
<P>WHEN the wither'd and &s;aple&s;s oak, which perhaps had &s;tood for ages, yields at la&s;t to the hand of time, lo&s;es it's verdure and decays, or is <HI>hewed down, and thrown into the fire,</HI> it cau&s;eth neither wonder nor regret: but when the young and flouri&s;hing plant, with all it's blo&s;&s;oms full and fair upon it, is on a &s;udden bla&s;ted by lightning,
<PB N="7" REF="7">
or torn up by &s;torm and tempe&s;t, then indeed we behold it with an eye of pity and a&s;toni&s;hment. And thus al&s;o when wearied nature &s;inks as it were to re&s;t, we are not di&s;turb'd at her repo&s;e; when the old and decrepid &s;ink into the grave, we nei|ther murmur nor repine; when the &s;ick and weak, who&s;e lives are burthen&s;ome and unea&s;y to others, are relea&s;ed by the interpo&s;ing hand of death from a &s;cene of perpetual mi&s;ery; when the poor, the oppre&s;&s;ed, and the captive are &s;et free from toil and &s;lavery; when the wicked are prevented from multiplying their crimes, and filling up the <HI>mea&s;ure of their iniquity,</HI> then it is that we call death a ble&s;|&s;ing, and &s;ubmit with readine&s;s to the determinati|ons of providence, and the decrees of the Almighty.</P>
<P>BUT when the order of nature is as it were rever&s;ed, when youth, health and vigour are in a moment changed into &s;ickne&s;s, deformity and decay; when death by a &s;udden and unexpected &s;troke cuts off the hopes of promi&s;ed plea&s;ures, and puts an end at once to the faire&s;t pro&s;pects of ri&s;ing virtue; this alarms the in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;tag|gers the re&s;olute; terrifies the wicked, dejects and di&s;pirits even the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>THUS &s;udden and thus dreadful, attended with circum&s;tances too affecting to relate, was the &s;troke which as it were in a moment &s;o lately
<PB N="8" REF="8">
away from us that worthy and e&s;teemed youth who &s;o lately filled this place.</P>
<P>THE &s;udden di&s;appearance of any object which hath been con&s;tantly before our eyes is always attended with &s;ome degree of anxiety, but when that object was the relation whom we loved, the friend whom we valued, the man whom we e&s;teemed, the pain mu&s;t then be very &s;harp, the &s;orrow mu&s;t be exqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>THERE is a time in human life, after which connections cannot be formed with delight, or relyed on with confidence, and when con&s;e|quently the remembrance of pa&s;t plea&s;ures can only &s;erve to embitter pre&s;ent happine&s;s.</P>
<P>YOU were not (and happy is it for you that you were not) like my&s;elf, very clo&s;ely and very intimately connected with him. The lo&s;s of a real friend whom we have tried and known, with whom we have been bred up from our earlie&s;t years, the partaker of all our joys, and the partner of all our griefs, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t acute and painful of all human calamities; it is a lo&s;s indeed which becometh every day and every hour more di&s;tre&s;sful; it is a wound cut as it were into the tree of life, and as the bark extends, and we advance in years, it groweth deeper and more vi&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9">
PERMIT me then to pay the tribute of friend|&s;hip to his beloved memory. Permit me to call to your remembrance how faithfully, how chear|fully, and how &s;ucce&s;sfully he laboured in your &s;ervice; how nobly he fought the cau&s;e of his Ma&s;ter and Redeemer; how &s;trenuou&s;ly he recom|mended <HI>his</HI> example, and how pathetically he enforced <HI>his</HI> precepts: his di&s;cour&s;es were always intelligible to the meane&s;t, and at the &s;ame time not beneath the attention of the highe&s;t capaci|ties. He preached the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in the &s;ame &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and humility which in|&s;pired the fir&s;t illu&s;trious teachers of it, without the o&s;tentatious parade of &s;uperior learning, or the fa&s;hionable pretence to &s;uperior godline&s;s, &s;o frequently of late years to be met with among&s;t us. He had piety enough to render his whole conduct through life, ju&s;t, uniform, and irre|proachable; and he who has more will only run into &s;uper&s;tition, bigotry and enthu&s;ia&s;m. He had learning &s;ufficient to improve and adorn his under&s;tanding without mi&s;guiding his judgment, or overwhelming his natural capacities. His &s;tile was animated, but not turgid; his action ju&s;t and lively, but not affected, or theatrical. He touch'd the pa&s;&s;ions of his hearers, but never inflamed them; and whil&s;t he appealed to their rea&s;on by argument, he never puzzled and confounded it by &s;ophi&s;try and delu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">
IT is indeed extraordinary, (and it is a circum|&s;tance which I am certain you have too much gratitude to forget) that con&s;idering <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He had been u&s;her of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> &s;chool almo&s;t ten years, and always di&s;tingui&s;h'd him&s;elf by his unwearied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> and a&s;&s;iduity&punc;</NOTE>the laborious employment in which he was con&s;tantly engag|ed, he could find time &s;o well and &s;o punctually to perform his duty here. But his indu&s;try was equal to his capacities, and whatever he had a mind to do, he was &s;ure to perform. Had he lived in an age when merit in his profe&s;&s;ion could have been any recommendation to him, his &s;ta|tion in the church had been as di&s;tingui&s;hed as his abilities: and he that <HI>de&s;erved</HI> the highe&s;t honours, would doubtle&s;s have <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> them.</P>
<P>HE filled this place indeed with &s;o much credit to him&s;elf, and gave &s;o much &s;atisfaction to all who heard him, as to leave no ea&s;y ta&s;k to tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ucceed him. Had it been <HI>my</HI> lot, I &s;hould have embraced it with fear and diffidence, but endeavoured to execute it with diligence and fidelity. I &s;hould have con&s;idered it as a kind of legacy bequeathed by my beloved friend, as an office committed to me by him, and con&s;e|quently &s;hould have had one additional obligation to the con&s;cientious di&s;charge of it. But &s;ince it is otherwi&s;e determined; you will, I hope, for|give my taking this opportunity of doing ju&s;|tice
<PB N="11" REF="11">
to one of the deare&s;t, and one of the be&s;t of men. The la&s;t time he ever performed the &s;acred function, and appeared in the pulpit, was to &s;upply my place in a neighbouring pari&s;h; it may be no improper return therefore, that the la&s;t time I may perhaps appear in this, I &s;hould take occa&s;ion to remember <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>BUT let us turn our eyes from what he <HI>&s;aid</HI> to what he <HI>did:</HI> from the precepts which he deli|vered to the far more in&s;tructive page of his ge|neral conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P>HIS life indeed was like his preaching, and his actions re&s;embled his di&s;cour&s;e; all pure, cha&s;te, ea&s;y and unaffected: his mode&s;ty by endeavour|ing to hide, but &s;erved the more to di&s;cover his merit: he never affected &s;uperiority on account of that knowledge which he <HI>had,</HI> or pretended to that which he had <HI>not:</HI> his conver&s;ation was affa|ble and courteous, without the lea&s;t taint of &s;ervi|lity or di&s;&s;imulation: his chearfulne&s;s never devi|ated into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, nor did his &s;incerity betray him into ill-manners; and in his gayer hours he had all the &s;prightline&s;s and vivacity of wit, with|out that &s;pleen, rancour and ill-nature which &s;o frequently accompany it.</P>
<P>TO the fire and &s;pirit of youth, he join'd the prudence and di&s;cretion of age. From a noble|ne&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="12">
of &s;oul, which few have equalled, he rather cho&s;e to &s;toop to an employment in life, to which he was infinitely &s;uperior, and which his con&s;ti|tution was indeed unequal to, than to wound his con&s;cience, or &s;acrifice his integrity by the mean compliances of a loo&s;e and degenerate age; by a &s;ervile dependance which he de&s;pi&s;ed, or a mean di&s;&s;imulation which he abhorr'd.</P>
<P>HE was, to &s;ay the truth, what one of our noble&s;t poets call, "the noble&s;t work of God, "an hone&s;t and an upright man." If he had a fault, it was a fault which only the be&s;t of na|tures are &s;ubject to, too delicate a feeling for the &s;ufferings of others, and too inten&s;e a &s;en&s;ibility of his own. He permitted &s;orrows for evils which he could not cure, to &s;ink too deep into his heart; and it hath been que&s;tioned, whether his exce&s;&s;ive grief for the death of another, did not in a great mea&s;ure ha&s;ten and contribute to his own. Thus were even his tenderne&s;s and piety pernicious to him; and that virtue incurred a <HI>pu|ni&s;hment,</HI> which doubtle&s;s had merited a <HI>reward.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;um up his character then as briefly as po&s;&s;ible; when heard, he was admired; when &s;een, e&s;teemed; when known, beloved. As a preacher attended to, and as a man re&s;pected; in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, a chri&s;tian, a &s;on, a brother, a companion, and a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
BUT alas! the pious chri&s;tian, the excellent preacher, the affectionate &s;on, the loving brother, the amiable companion, and the &s;incere friend are now no more.</P>
<P>SINCE &s;uch he was, &s;hall we lament, or &s;hall we envy his condition? Parents mu&s;t weep, friends will complain, mankind in general may regret the lo&s;s, but &s;urely this con&s;olation &s;till remains with all; that the &s;orrows which <HI>we</HI> feel, <HI>he</HI> doth not partake of; and that he whom we bewail is mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly happy, though we can <HI>not</HI> be &s;o.</P>
<P>IN regard to tho&s;e who mu&s;t mo&s;t deeply feel his lo&s;s, tho&s;e pious, good and afflicted parents who regret him, they will I doubt not &s;ubmit to the divine will. They will reflect, that as no man whil&s;t he lives can be pronounced truly hap|py, &s;o neither can we affirm any man truly good or virtuous whil&s;t he lives, becau&s;e there is al|ways a po&s;&s;ibility of falling both into mi&s;ery and vice.</P>
<P>HAD they left <HI>him</HI> behind therefore, they mu&s;t have left him to be to&s;&s;ed in the ocean of life, where the boi&s;terous and unruly pa&s;&s;ions might have overwhelmed all his virtues, and &s;unk him into the aby&s;s of &s;in and &s;orrow; they will re|flect with plea&s;ure therefore, that <HI>Death</HI> hath as
<PB N="14" REF="14">
it were &s;et the &s;eal upon his character, and put it out of the power of a vicious world to corrupt, or of a deceitful world to betray him. They will reflect al&s;o what he was taken <HI>from,</HI> and what they may rea&s;onably hope he is tran&s;ported <HI>to;</HI> taken from a fluctuating &s;cene of guilt and mi&s;ery, to a permanent and certain &s;tate of ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s; to a place where his virtues could be no longer &s;ubject to change, diminu|tion, or decay. If they reflect that he was &s;natched away from them in the meridian of his age, they will reflect al&s;o, that he was prepared for it by a life of innocence and goodne&s;s; that the &s;ooner he de&s;erved happine&s;s, the &s;ooner he obtained it; that his death therefore was graci|ou&s;ly ordained by the Almighty, that &s;uch <HI>early</HI> virtues might be recompen&s;ed by as <HI>early</HI> a reward.</P>
<P>IF they reflect with &s;orrow, as they doubtle&s;s will, that he &s;hall never <HI>return</HI> to them, they will reflect al&s;o, and &s;urely with the utmo&s;t plea|&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, that it will not be long be|fore they &s;hall <HI>go to him;</HI> that he only ha&s;tened his journey to the other world, that he might be ready to receive them there; that he is employed in heaven as he lov'd to be on earth, in acts of duty towards <HI>them,</HI> and is even now perhaps pre|paring
<PB N="15" REF="15">
for them the &s;eats of uninterrupted happine&s;s de&s;igned for them by their bountiful creator in the regions of bli&s;s and immortality.</P>
<P>THAT we &s;hall once again &s;ee our departed friends in another &s;tate is very agreeable to our hopes, by no means di&s;&s;onant to rea&s;on, nor, as I know of, contradicted by revelation or &s;cripture. It is a joy highly rational, and therefore well adapted to a rational being; it is a joy purely &s;pi|ritual, and therefore not unworthy of a &s;piritual being.</P>
<P>LET us remember then for our con&s;olation, that, if he cannot <HI>return</HI> to us, we may <HI>go to him.</HI></P>
<P>SCENES of this melancholy nature mu&s;t of cour&s;e, if duly attended to, reform and purify the mind, they are de&s;ign'd by the Almighty for our warning and for our in&s;truction.</P>
<P>PERMIT them then, I be&s;eech you, to have their due effect upon us.</P>
<P>AN example &s;o terrible, an in&s;tance &s;o alarm|ing of the in&s;tability of all that is human, mu&s;t &s;urely be more than &s;ufficient to repre&s;s the pride of the in&s;olent, and to check the hopes of the ambitious; to &s;top the profligate in his career of plea&s;ure, and to poi&s;on the fea&s;t of the volup|tuous.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="16">
SINCE neither that youth which promi&s;eth life, nor that health which &s;upports, could here con|tinue it; &s;ince neither the temperance which lays claim to years, nor the virtue which de&s;erves, could procure them for him, who &s;hall be proud of his &s;trength, or who &s;hall glory in his own perfections? Who &s;hall promi&s;e to them&s;elves length of days, when they remember <HI>him</HI> who had not run out half his cour&s;e? The old can|not be &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to hope it, the young have no right nor authority to expect it.</P>
<P>HEAR <HI>this then,</HI> as the Prophet &s;ays, <HI>thou that dwelle&s;t carele&s;ly, thou that art given to plea&s;ures, thou that &s;aye&s;t in thine heart, I am, and none el&s;e be&s;ides me. I &s;hall not &s;it as a wi|dow, neither &s;hall I know the lo&s;s of children. But the&s;e two things &s;hall come unto thee in a moment, in one day the lo&s;s of children and widowhood they &s;hall come upon thee.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT <HI>manner of men</HI> therefore, my brethren, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>ought we to be in all conver|&s;ation and godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>YOU once li&s;ten'd with attention to him as a preacher; his life al&s;o was a mo&s;t in&s;tructive &s;er|mon, let his death be &s;o likewi&s;e; let it teach us to &s;et immediately about the nece&s;&s;ary work of repentance, to prepare for the great and im|portant
<PB N="17" REF="17">
day which is to call us off from this tran&s;itory &s;cene, and fix us in a better and more durable one.</P>
<P>IF we would <HI>go to him</HI> whom we lament, we mu&s;t tread in the &s;ame paths of honour and virtue: we mu&s;t follow <HI>his</HI> &s;teps if we would meet with <HI>his</HI> reward: we mu&s;t <HI>live</HI> the <HI>life,</HI> if we would <HI>die the death of the righteous;</HI> if (like him) we would, whil&s;t upon earth be e&s;|teem'd and lov'd, and when remov'd from it, prai&s;ed and lamented, let us be careful <HI>&s;o to run as to obtain;</HI> that after we have pa&s;&s;ed through the waves of this &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous world we may join him in the harbour of re&s;t and felicity, and after all our &s;orrows here, be tran&s;|ported to the regions of joy and happine&s;s, where we hope and believe <HI>he</HI> is rewarded, and is now &s;atiating his thir&s;t in <HI>tho&s;e rivers of bli&s;s which flow at God's right hand for ever|more.</HI></P>
