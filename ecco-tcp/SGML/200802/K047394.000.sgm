<P>If your infinuation means that my heart has not been in&s;en&s;ible of the charms of &s;ome fair Lady, you are right; but my transformation is owing to no whim of her's: for, oh <HI>Charles!</HI> &s;he never yet conde&s;cended to make me the object of her thoughts.</P>

<P>Oh, very trifling! only the right of a Hu&s;band&mdash;The Lady &s;o honour'd by your love-making <HI>in je&s;t</HI> is my wife; in cour&s;e, all obligations to her devolve on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your wife! My dear <HI>Belville,</HI> I give you joy with all my &s;oul! You &s;ee 'tis always dangerous to keep &s;ecrets from your friends. But is any body el&s;e coming? Have I any new crimes to be accus'd of? Any more witne&s;&s;es coming to the bar?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but I am a witne&s;s in a new cau&s;e, and accu&s;e you of loading the mind of my friend <HI>Beauchamp</HI> with a &s;en&s;e of obligation you had neither &s;pirit or ju&s;tice to confer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell</SPEAKER>
<P>A Commi&s;&s;ion, my Lord, which was &s;ent Mr. <HI>Beauchamp</HI> under a blank cover, by one who could not bear to &s;ee his noble &s;pirit dependent on your caprices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belv.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when his &s;entiments pointed out your Lord|&s;hip as his benefactor, you accepted the honour, and have laid heavy taxes on his gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what is there in all that? <HI>Beauchamp</HI> did not know to whom he was obliged; and wou'dn't it have been a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian thing to let a good action run about the world belonging to nobody?&mdash;I found it a &s;tray orphan, and &s;o father'd it.&mdash;But you, <HI>Fitzherbert,</HI> I &s;ee are the lawful owner of the brat; &s;o prithee take it back, and thank me for the honour of my patronage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your affected plea&s;antry, Lord <HI>Sparkle,</HI> may &s;hield you from re&s;entment, but it will not from contempt. Your effrontery&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Effrontery! Prithee make di&s;tinctions!&mdash;What in certain lines would be effrontery, in me is only the ea&s;e of Fa&s;hion; that delightful thing, which enables me at this moment to &s;tand &s;erene amid&s;t your meditated &s;torm.&mdash;
<PB N="53" REF="56">
Come, my dear Lady <HI>Bell,</HI> let us leave the&s;e good gentry, and love our&s;elves amid&s;t the delights of fa&s;hion, and the charms of <HI>bon ton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, my Lord! As caprice is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the character of a fine lady, you will not be &s;urpris'd if I give an in&s;tance of it now; and, &s;pite of your elegance, your fa&s;hion, and your wit, pre&s;ent my hand to this poor &s;oldier&mdash;who boa&s;ts only worth, &s;pirit, honour, and love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care, Madam!&mdash;Feelings like mine are not to be trifled with! Once already the hopes you have in&s;pir'd&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hour of <HI>trifling</HI> is pa&s;t; and &s;urely it can|not appear extraordinary, that I prefer the internal worth of an uncorrupted heart, to the outward poli&s;h of a mind too feeble to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t vice, in the &s;eductive forms of fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey-dey! what, is your Lady&s;hip in the plot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>The plot has been deeper laid than you, my Lord, have been able to conceive. As I have the misfortune to be related to you, I thought it my duty to watch over your conduct. I have &s;een your plans, which generally tended to your confu&s;ion and di&s;grace; and many of them have been defeated, tho' you knew not by what means. But what fate does your Lord&s;hip de&s;ign for the&s;e young people, de|coy'd by you from their native ignorance and home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let them return to their native ignorance and home as fa&s;t as they can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pend.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; hang me if I do that!&mdash;I know Life now, and Life I'll have&mdash;Hyde-Park, Plays, Operas, and all that &s;ort of thing.&mdash;But, Old Gentleman, as you pro|mis'd to do &s;omething for me, what think ye of a Commi&s;|&s;ion?&mdash;The Captain there can't want his now; &s;uppo&s;e you turn it over to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, young man, you &s;hall be taken care of; but the requi&s;ites of a &s;oldier are not tho&s;e of pertne&s;s and a&s;|&s;urance. Intrepid &s;pirit, nice honour, genero&s;ity, and un|der&s;tanding, all unite to form him.&mdash;It is the&s;e which will make a Briti&s;h &s;oldier once again the fir&s;t character in Eu|rope.&mdash;It is &s;uch &s;oldiers who mu&s;t make England once again invincible, and her glittering arms triumphant in every quarter of the globe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sophy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Bobby</HI> may do as he will&mdash;I'll go back to Cornwall directly, and warn all my neighbours to take &s;pe|cial
<PB N="54" REF="57">
care how they tru&s;t to a Lord's promi&s;es at an Election again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Spark.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, great attempts and great failings mark the life of a man of &s;pirit!&mdash;There is eclat even in my di&s;ap|pointment to-night; and I am ready for a fre&s;h &s;et of ad|ventures to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incorrigible man!&mdash;But I have done with <HI>you.&mdash;Beauchamp</HI> has an&s;wered all my hopes, and the di&s;cernment of this charming woman, in rewarding him, merits the hap|pine&s;s that awaits her; and that I may give the fulle&s;t &s;anc|tion to her choice, I declare <HI>him</HI> heir to my e&s;tate. This, I know, is a &s;troke your Lord&s;hip did not expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was it then to you, Sir!&mdash;The tumults of my gratitude&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your conduct has compleatly rewarded me; and in adopting you&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(interrupting)</STAGE>
<P> Oh, I prote&s;t again&s;t that!&mdash;Our union would then appear a prudent, &s;ober bu&s;ine&s;s, and I &s;hould lo&s;e the credit of having done a mad thing for the &s;ake of the man&mdash;my heart prefers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fitz.</SPEAKER>
<P>To you I re&s;ign him with plea&s;ure: his fate is in your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Bell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he &s;hall continue a &s;oldier&mdash;one of tho&s;e whom Love and his Country detain to guard her deare&s;t, <HI>la&s;t</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Beauch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love and my Country! Yes, ye &s;hall divide my heart!&mdash;Animated by &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, our forefathers were invincible; and if we wou'd pre&s;erve the freedom and independence they obtain'd for us, we mu&s;t imitate their virtues.</P>
