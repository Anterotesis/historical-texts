<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. <HI>Death of Gratian.&mdash;Ruin of Ariani&s;m.&mdash;St. Am|bro&s;e.&mdash;Fir&s;t civil War, again&s;t Maximus.&mdash;Cha|racter, Admini&s;tration, and Pennance, of Theodo|&s;ius.&mdash;Death of Valentinian</HI> II.<HI>&mdash;Second civil War, again&s;t Eugenius.&mdash;Death of Theodo&s;ius.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fame of Gratian, before he had ac|compli&s;hed the twentieth year of his age, was equal to that of the mo&s;t cele|brated <NOTE PLACE="marg">Character and con|duct of the emperor Gratian. A. D. 379&mdash;383.</NOTE> princes. His gentle and amiable di&s;po|&s;ition endeared him to his private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the liberality, acknowledged the ta&s;te and eloquence, of their &s;overeign; his valour and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the
<PB N="2" REF="10">
&s;oldiers; and the clergy con&s;idered the humble piety of Gratian as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful of his virtues. The victory of Colmar had delivered the We&s;t from a formidable inva&s;ion; and the grateful provinces of the Ea&s;t a&s;cribed the merits of Theodo&s;ius, to the author of <HI>his</HI> greatne&s;s, and of the public &s;afety. Gratian &s;urvived tho&s;e me|morable events only four or five years; but he &s;urvived his reputation; and, before he fell a victim to rebellion, he had lo&s;t, in a great mea|&s;ure, the re&s;pect and confidence of the Roman world.</P>
<P>The remarkable alteration of his character or <NOTE PLACE="marg">His de|fects.</NOTE> conduct, may not be imputed to the arts of flat|tery, which had be&s;ieged the &s;on of Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions which that gentle youth appears to have e&s;caped. A more attentive view of the life of Gratian, may perhaps &s;ugge&s;t the true cau&s;e of the di&s;appoint|ment of the public hopes. His apparent vir|tues, in&s;tead of being the hardy productions of experience and adver&s;ity, were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education. The anxious tenderne&s;s of his father was continually employed to be&s;tow on him tho&s;e advantages, which he might perhaps e&s;teem the more highly, as he him&s;elf had been deprived of them; and the mo&s;t &s;kilful ma&s;ters of every &s;cience, and of every art, had laboured to form the mind and body of the young prince <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Valentinian was le&s;s attentive to the religion of his &s;on; &s;ince he entru&s;ted the education of Gratian to Au&s;onius, a profe&s;&s;ed Pagan (Mem. de l'Academie des In&s;criptions, tom. xv. p. 125&mdash;138.). The poetical fame of Au&s;onius condemns the ta&s;te of his age.</NOTE>. The knowledge which they pain|fully
<PB N="3" REF="11">
communicated was di&s;played with o&s;tenta|tion, and celebrated with lavi&s;h prai&s;e. His &s;oft and tractable di&s;po&s;ition received the fair impre&s;|&s;ion of their judicious precepts, and the ab&s;ence of pa&s;&s;ion might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for the &s;trength of rea&s;on. His preceptors gradually ro&s;e to the rank and con&s;equence of mini&s;ters of &s;tate <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Au&s;onius was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively promoted to the Praetorian praefecture of Italy (A. D. 377.), and of Gaul (A. D. 378.); and was at length inve&s;ted with the con&s;ul&s;hip (A. D. 379.). He expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude in a &s;ervile and in&s;ipid piece of flattery (Actio Gratiarum, p. 699&mdash;736.), which has &s;urvived more worthy productions.</NOTE>; and, as they wi&s;ely di&s;&s;embled their &s;ecret autho|rity, he &s;eemed to act with firmne&s;s, with pro|priety, and with judgment, on the mo&s;t important occa&s;ions of his life and reign. But the influence of this elaborate in&s;truction did not penetrate be|yond the &s;urface; and the &s;kilful preceptors, who &s;o accurately guided the &s;teps of their royal pupil, could not infu&s;e into his feeble and indolent cha|racter, the vigorous and independent principle of action, which renders the laborious pur&s;uit of glory e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s, and almo&s;t to the exi&s;tence, of the hero. As &s;oon as time and accident had removed tho&s;e faithful coun&s;ellors from the throne, the emperor of the We&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;cended to the level of his na|tural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the ambitious hands which were &s;tretched for|wards to gra&s;p them; and amu&s;ed his lei&s;ure with the mo&s;t frivolous gratifications. A public &s;ale of favour and inju&s;tice was in&s;tituted, both

<P>The behaviour of Gratian, which degraded his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;content of the Roman troops. A.

During the &s;ea|&s;on of &s;incere grief, or o&s;tentatious mourning, the Ea&s;tern emperor was interrupted by the ar|rival  of the principal chamberlain of Maximus: and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office which was u&s;ually exerci&s;ed by eunuchs, announced to the court of Con&s;tantinople the gravity and temperance of the Briti&s;h u&s;urper. The amba&s;&s;ador conde&s;cended to ju&s;tify, or ex|cu&s;e, the conduct of his ma&s;ter; and to prote&s;t, in &s;pecious language, that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated, without his knowledge or con&s;ent, by the precipitate zeal of the &s;oldiers. But he proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodo&s;ius the alternative of peace, or war. The &s;peech of the amba&s;&s;ador concluded with a &s;pirited declaration, that although Maximus, as a Roman, and as the father of his people, would chu&s;e rather to employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was armed and prepared, if his friend&s;hip &s;hould be rejected, to di&s;pute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. An immediate and peremptory an&s;wer was required; but it was extremely difficult for Theodo&s;ius to &s;atisfy, on this im|portant occa&s;ion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honour and gratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of Gra|tian,

he had received the Imperial diadem: his patience would encourage the odious &s;u&s;picion, that he was more deeply &s;en&s;ible of former in|juries, than of recent obligations; and if he ac|cepted the friend&s;hip, he mu&s;t &s;eem to &s;hare the guilt, of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Even the principles of ju&s;tice, and the intere&s;t of &s;ociety, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus: and the example of &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;urpation would tend to di&s;&s;olve the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age. But, as the &s;entiments of gratitude and honour &s;hould invariably regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced in the mind of a &s;ove|reign, by the &s;en&s;e of &s;uperior duties: and the maxims both of ju&s;tice and humanity, mu&s;t per|mit the e&s;cape of an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in the con&s;e|quences of his puni&s;hment. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of Gra|tian had u&s;urped, but he actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the mo&s;t warlike provinces of the empire: the Ea&s;t was exhau&s;ted by the misfortunes, and even by the &s;ucce&s;s, of the Gothic war; and it was &s;eriou&s;ly to be apprehended, that, after the vital &s;trength of the republic had been wa&s;ted in a doubtful and de&s;tructive conte&s;t, the feeble conqueror would remain an ea&s;y prey to the Bar|barians of the North.

the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the &s;ummit of the Julian Alps, he de|&s;cended with &s;uch incredible &s;peed into the plain of Italy, that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the fir&s;t day; and Maximus, who found him&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, had &s;carcely time to &s;hut the gates of the city.

The behaviour of the emperor was not intended to in&s;ult, and he &s;hewed &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the We&s;t, who had never been his per|&s;onal enemy, and was now become the object of his contempt. Our &s;ympathy is the mo&s;t forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are ex|po&s;ed; and the &s;pectacle of a proud competitor, now pro&s;trate at his feet, could not fail of pro|ducing very &s;erious and &s;olemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked by his regard for public ju&s;tice, and the memory of Gra|tian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the &s;oldiers, who drew him out of the Im|perial pre&s;ence, and in&s;tantly &s;eparated his head from his body.

When he had thus ter|minated the civil war, with le&s;s difficulty and blood&s;hed than he might naturally expect, he em|ployed the winter months of his re&s;idence at Milan, to re&s;tore the &s;tate of the afflicted pro|vinces; and early in the &s;pring he made, after the example of Con&s;tantine and Con&s;tantius, his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire <NOTE N="77" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the hints which may be gathered from chronicles and eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, Zo&s;imus (l. iv. p. 259&mdash;267.), Oro&s;ius (l. vii. c. 35.), and Pacatus (in Panegyr.

wi&s;dom of his laws, and the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, rendered his admini&s;tration re&s;pectable in the eyes both of his &s;ubjects, and of his enemies. He loved and practi&s;ed the virtues of dome&s;tic life, which &s;eldom hold their re&s;idence in the palaces of kings. Theodo&s;ius was cha&s;te and temperate: he enjoyed, without exce&s;s, the &s;en&s;ual and &s;ocial plea&s;ures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous pa&s;&s;ions was never diverted from their lawful objects. The proud titles of Imperial greatne&s;s were adorned by the tender names of a faithful hu&s;band, an indulgent father; his uncle was rai&s;ed, by his affectionate e&s;teem, to the rank of a &s;econd parent: Theodo&s;ius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and &s;i&s;ter; and the expre&s;&s;ions of his regard were extended to the mo&s;t di&s;tant and ob&s;cure branches of his nu|merous kindred. His familiar friends were ju|diciou&s;ly &s;elected from among tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, in the equal intercour&s;e of private life, had ap|peared before his eyes without a ma&s;k: the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of per&s;onal and &s;uperior merit enabled him to de&s;pi&s;e the accidental di&s;tinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he had forgotten all the injuries, while he mo&s;t grate|fully remembered all the favours and &s;ervices, which he had received before he a&s;cended the throne of the Roman empire. The &s;erious, or lively, tone of his conver&s;ation, was adapted to the age, the rank, or the character, of his &s;ub|jects whom he admitted into his &s;ociety; and the affability of his manners di&s;played the image of his mind. Theodo&s;ius re&s;pected the &s;implicity of
<PB N="57" REF="65">
the good and virtuous; every art, every talent, of an u&s;eful, or even of an innocent, nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and, except the heretics, whom he per&s;ecuted with implacable hatred, the diffu&s;ive circle of his benevolence was circum&s;cribed only by the limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire may a&s;&s;uredly &s;uffice to occupy the time, and the abi|lities, of a mortal: yet the diligent prince, with|out a&s;piring to the un&s;uitable reputation of pro|found learning, always re&s;erved &s;ome moments of his lei&s;ure for the in&s;tructive amu&s;ement of read|ing. Hi&s;tory, which enlarged his experience, was his favourite &s;tudy. The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years, pre|&s;ented him with a various and &s;plendid picture of human life; and it has been particularly ob&s;erved, that whenever he peru&s;ed the cruel acts of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla, he warmly expre&s;&s;ed his generous dete&s;tation of tho&s;e enemies of humanity and freedom. His di&s;intere&s;ted opinion of pa&s;t events was u&s;efully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodo&s;ius has de&s;erved the &s;ingular commendation, that his virtues always &s;eemed to expand with his fortune: the &s;ea&s;on of his pro|&s;perity was that of his moderation; and his cle|mency appeared the mo&s;t con&s;picuous after the danger and &s;ucce&s;s of the civil war. The Moori&s;h guards of the tyrant had been ma&s;&s;acred in the fir&s;t heat of the victory; and a &s;mall number of the mo&s;t obnoxious criminals &s;uffered the puni&s;h|ment of the law. But the emperor &s;hewed him|&s;elf much more attentive to relieve the innocent,

The exigencies of the Gothic war, and the inevitable expence that accompanied the conclu&s;ion of the peace, had con&s;trained the em|peror to aggravate the weight of the public im|po&s;itions; and the provinces of A&s;ia, as they had not been involved in the di&s;tre&s;s, were the le&s;s inclined to contribute to the relief, of Europe.

more dreadful con&s;equences. That great city, the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces, had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by &s;trong fortifications, and a numerous gar|ri&s;on. Botheric, the general of tho&s;e troops, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem from his name, a Barbarian, had among his &s;laves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure de&s;ires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The in&s;olent and brutal lover was thrown into pri&s;on by the order of Botheric; and he &s;ternly rejected the importunate clamours of the multitude, who, on the day of the public games, lamented the ab&s;ence of their favourite; and con|&s;idered the &s;kill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue. The re&s;ent|ment of the people was embittered by &s;ome pre|vious di&s;putes; and, as the &s;trength of the gar|ri&s;on had been drawn away for the &s;ervice of the Italian war, the feeble remnant, who&s;e numbers were reduced by de&s;ertion, could not &s;ave the un|happy general from their licentious fury. Bo|theric, and &s;everal of his principal officers, were inhumanly murdered: their mangled bodies were dragged about the &s;treets; and the emperor, who then re&s;ided at Milan, was &s;urpri&s;ed by the intel|ligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of The&s;&s;alonica. The &s;entence of a di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate judge would have inflicted a &s;evere puni&s;hment on the authors of the crime; and the merit of Botheric might contribute to exa&s;perate the grief and indignation of his ma&s;ter. The fiery and choleric temper of Theodo&s;ius was im|patient of the dilatory forms of a judicial enquiry;
<PB N="66" REF="74">
and he ha&s;tily re&s;olved, that the blood of his lieu|tenant &s;hould be expiated by the blood of the guilty people. Yet his mind &s;till fluctuated be|tween the coun&s;els of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the bi&s;hops had almo&s;t extorted from the reluctant emperor the promi&s;e of a general pardon; his pa&s;&s;ion was again inflamed by the flattering &s;ugge&s;tions of his mini&s;ter Rufinus; and, after Theodo&s;ius had di&s;patched the me&s;&s;en|gers of death, he attempted, when it was too late, to prevent the execution of his orders. The pu|ni&s;hment of a Roman city was blindly committed to the undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;word of the Barbarians; and the ho&s;tile preparations were concerted with the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal con|&s;piracy. The people of The&s;&s;alonica were trea|cherou&s;ly invited, in the name of their &s;overeign, to the games of the Circus: and &s;uch was their in|&s;atiate avidity for tho&s;e amu&s;ements, that every con&s;ideration of fear, or &s;u&s;picion, was di&s;re|guarded by the numerous &s;pectators.

<P>The effeminate luxury, which infected the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The in|fantry lay a&s;ide their armour.</NOTE> manners of courts and cities, had in&s;tilled a &s;ecret and de&s;tructive poi&s;on into the camps of the legions: and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military writer, who had accurate|ly &s;tudied the genuine and ancient principles of Roman di&s;cipline. It is the ju&s;t and important ob&s;ervation of Vegetius, that the infantry was invariably covered with defen&s;ive armour, from the foundation of the city, to the reign of the emperor Gratian. The relaxation of di&s;cipline, and the di&s;u&s;e of exerci&s;e, rendered the &s;oldiers le&s;s able, and le&s;s willing, to &s;upport the fatigues of the &s;ervice; they complained of the weight of the armour, which they &s;eldom wore; and they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively obtained the permi&s;&s;ion of laying a&s;ide both their cuira&s;&s;es and their helmets. The heavy weapons of their ance&s;tors, the &s;hort &s;word, and the formidable <HI>pilum,</HI> which had &s;ubdued the world, in&s;en&s;ibly dropped from their feeble hands. As the u&s;e of the &s;hield is incompatible with that of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to &s;uffer, either the pain of wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and always di&s;po&s;ed to prefer the more &s;hameful alternative. The cavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani, had felt the benefits, and adopted the u&s;e,

of defen&s;ive armour; and, as they excelled in the management of mi&s;&s;ile weapons, they ea&s;ily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, who&s;e heads and brea&s;ts were expo&s;ed, without defence, to the arrows of the Barbarians. The lo&s;s of armies, the de&s;truction of cities, and the di&s;honour of the Roman name, ineffectually &s;oli|cited the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Gratian to re&s;tore the hel|mets and cuira&s;&s;es of the infantry.

The coffins of Gamaliel, of his &s;on, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when the fourth coffin, which con|tained the remains of Stephen, was &s;hewn to the light, the earth trembled, and an odour, &s;uch as that of paradi&s;e, was &s;melt, which in&s;tantly cured the various di&s;ea&s;es of &s;eventy-three of the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants.

<P>THE genius of Rome expired with Theo|do&s;ius; the la&s;t of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Au|gu&s;tus and Con&s;tantine, who appeared in the field <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divi&s;ion of the empire between Arcadius and Hono|rius, A. D. 395. Jan. 17.</NOTE> at the head of their armies, and who&s;e authority was univer&s;ally acknowledged throughout the whole extent of the empire. The memory of his virtues &s;till continued, however, to protect the feeble and inexperienced youth of his two &s;ons. After the death of their father, Arcadius and Honorius were &s;aluted, by the unanimous con&s;ent of mankind, as the lawful emperors of the Ea&s;t, and of the We&s;t; and the oath of fidelity was eagerly taken by every order of the &s;tate; the &s;enates of old and new Rome, the clergy, the magi&s;trates, the &s;oldiers, and the people. Ar|cadius, who then was about eighteen years of age, was born in Spain, in the humble habitation of a private family. But he received a princely education in the palace of Con&s;tantinople; and his inglorious life was &s;pent in that peaceful and &s;plendid &s;eat of royalty, from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace, A&s;ia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, from the Lower Danube to the confines of Per&s;ia and Aethiopia. His younger brother, Honorius, a&s;&s;umed, in the eleventh year

of his age, the nominal government of Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain, and Britain; and the troops, which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom, were oppo&s;ed, on one &s;ide, to the Caledonians, and on the other to the Moors. The great and martial praefecture of Illyricum was divided between the two princes: the defence and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pro|vinces of Noricum, Pannonia, and Dalmatia, &s;till belonged to the we&s;tern empire; but the two large dioce&s;es of Dacia and Macedonia, which Gratian had entru&s;ted to the valour of Theodo&s;ius, were for ever united to the empire of the Ea&s;t. The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now &s;eparates the Germans and the Turks; and the re&s;pective advantages of territory, riches, populou&s;ne&s;s, and military &s;trength, were fairly balanced and compen&s;ated, in this final and permanent divi&s;ion of the Roman em|pire. The hereditary &s;ceptre of the &s;ons of Theo|do&s;ius appeared to be the gift of nature, and of their father; the generals and mini&s;ters had been accu&s;tomed to adore the maje&s;ty of the royal in|fants; and the army and people were not admo|ni&s;hed of their rights, and of their power, by the dangerous example of a recent election. The gradual di&s;covery of the weakne&s;s of Arcadius and Honorius, and the repeated calamities of their reign, were not &s;ufficient to obliterate the deep and early impre&s;&s;ions of loyalty. The &s;ub|jects of Rome, who &s;till reverenced the per&s;ons, or rather the names, of their &s;overeigns, beheld, with equal abhorrence, the rebels who oppo&s;ed,

his pa&s;&s;ions were &s;ub&s;ervient only to the pa&s;&s;ions of his ma&s;ter: yet, in the horrid ma&s;&s;acre of The&s;|&s;alonica, the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury, without imitating the repentance, of Theodo&s;ius.

The new praefect of the Ea&s;t (for Rufinus in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded to the vacant honours of his adver&s;ary) was not diverted, however, by the mo&s;t criminal pur&s;uits, from the performance of the religious duties, which in that age were con&s;idered as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to &s;alvation.

If avarice were not the blinde&s;t of the human pa&s;&s;ions, the motives of Rufinus might excite our curio&s;ity; and we might be tempted to inquire, with what view he violated every principle of humanity and ju&s;tice, to accumulate tho&s;e immen&s;e trea&s;ures, which he could not &s;pend without folly, nor po&s;&s;e&s;s without danger. Perhaps he vainly ima|gined, that he laboured for the intere&s;t of an only daughter, on whom he intended to be&s;tow his royal pupil, and the augu&s;t rank of Empre&s;s of the Ea&s;t. Perhaps he deceived him&s;elf by the opinion, that his avarice was the in&s;trument of his ambition.

Lucian proclaimed to the Ea&s;t, that the praefect, who&s;e indu&s;try was much abated in the di&s;patch of ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, was active and indefatigable in the pur&s;uit of revenge. Lucian, the &s;on of the praefect Florentius, the oppre&s;&s;or of Gaul, and the enemy of Julian, had employed a con&s;iderable part of his inheritance, the fruit of rapine and corruption, to purcha&s;e the friend&s;hip of Rufinus, and the high office of Count of the Ea&s;t. But the new magi&s;trate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court, and of the times; di&s;graced his benefactor, by the contra&s;t of a virtuous and temperate admini&s;tration; and pre&s;umed to re|fu&s;e an act of inju&s;tice, which might have tended to the profit of the emperor's uncle. Arcadius was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to re&s;ent the &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;ult; and the praefect of the Ea&s;t re&s;olved to execute in per&s;on the cruel vengeance, which he meditated again&s;t this ungrateful delegate of his power.

The count of the fifteen provinces of the Ea&s;t was dragged, like the vile&s;t malefactor, before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus. Not|with&s;tanding the cleare&s;t evidence of his integrity, which was not impeached even by the voice of an accu&s;er, Lucian was condemned, almo&s;t with|out a trial, to &s;uffer a cruel and ignominious pu|ni&s;hment.

The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had re&s;pected the faith of treaties, were ju&s;tly indig|nant, that the ruin of Greece and Epirus &s;hould be &s;o liberally rewarded.

The danger of leaving his inactive troops in tho&s;e camps, which had been twice polluted with blood and &s;edition, urged him to attempt the reduction of the We&s;tern provinces.

of Gaul, which had e&s;caped the yoke of the Bar|barians, to acknowledge their lawful &s;overeign. They obeyed the &s;ummons without reluctance. The neglect of the court of Ravenna had ab&s;olved a de&s;erted people from the duty of allegiance; their actual di&s;tre&s;s encouraged them to accept any circum&s;tances of change, without apprehen|&s;ion, and, perhaps, with &s;ome degree of hope; and they might flatter them&s;elves, that the troops, the authority, and even the name of a Roman emperor, who fixed his re&s;idence in Gaul, would protect the unhappy country from the rage of the Barbarians. The fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Con&s;tantine again&s;t the detached parties of the Germans, were magnified by the voice of adulation into &s;plendid and deci&s;ive victories; which the re|union and in&s;olence of the enemy &s;oon reduced to their ju&s;t value. His negociations procured a &s;hort and precarious truce; and if &s;ome tribes of the Barbarians were engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promi&s;es, to undertake the defence of the Rhine, the&s;e expen&s;ive and uncertain trea|ties, in&s;tead of re&s;toring the pri&s;tine vigour of the Gallic frontier, &s;erved only to di&s;grace the ma|je&s;ty of the prince, and to exhau&s;t what yet re|mained of the trea&s;ures of the republic. Elated however with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South, to encounter a more pre&s;&s;ing and per|&s;onal danger. Sarus the Goth was ordered to lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius; and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily con&s;umed in this dome&s;tic quar|rel.

After the lo&s;s of his two brave&s;t generals, Ju&s;tinian and Neviga&s;tes, the former of whom was &s;lain in the field of battle, the latter in a peaceful but treacherous interview, Con&s;tantine fortified him&s;elf within the walls of Vienna.

<P>On the &s;ide of the Pyrenees, the ambition of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He reduces Spain, A.

He had de&s;erved the e&s;teem, and he &s;oon accepted the friend&s;hip, of Stilicho him&s;elf. Renouncing the &s;ervice of the emperor of the Ea&s;t, Alaric concluded, with the court of Ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was declared ma&s;ter-general of the Roman armies throughout the praefecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the true and an|cient limits, by the mini&s;ter of Honorius <NOTE N="101" PLACE="foot">The&s;e dark tran&s;actions are inve&s;tigated by the Count de Buat (Hi&s;t. des Peuples de l'Europe, tom. vii. c. iii&mdash;viii. p. 69&mdash;206.), who&s;e laborious accuracy may &s;ometimes fatigue a &s;uperficial reader.</NOTE>.

and of the finances; and declared his impatience to lead, to the gates of Con&s;tantinople, the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths.

The nece&s;&s;ity of finding &s;ome arti|ficial &s;upport for a government, which, from a principle, not of moderation, but of weakne&s;s, was reduced to negociate with its own &s;ubjects, had in&s;en&s;ibly revived the authority of the Roman &s;enate: and the mini&s;ter of Honorius re&s;pectfully con&s;ulted the legi&s;lative council of the republic. Stilicho a&s;&s;embled the &s;enate in the palace of the Cae&s;ars; repre&s;ented, in a &s;tudied oration, the actual &s;tate of affairs; propo&s;ed the demands of the Gothic king, and &s;ubmitted to their con|&s;ideration the choice of peace or war. The &s;e|nators, as if they had been &s;uddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred years, appeared on this important occa&s;ion to be in&s;pired by the cou|rage, rather than by the wi&s;dom, of their prede|ce&s;&s;ors.

The mi|ni&s;ter,

who&s;e pacific intentions were &s;econded only by the voices of a few &s;ervile and venal followers, attempted to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct, and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. <Q>"The payment of a &s;ub&s;idy, which had excited the indignation of the Romans, ought not (&s;uch was the lan|guage of Stilicho) to be con&s;idered in the odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ran&s;om, extorted by the menaces of a Barbarian enemy.

The generous  boldne&s;s of Lampadius had been applauded; and the &s;enate, &s;o patiently re&s;igned to a long &s;ervi|tude, rejected with di&s;dain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom.

Yet Stilicho might have continued to brave the clamours of the people, and even of the &s;oldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil.

Olympius revealed to the un&s;u&s;pecting emperor, who had attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without weight, or authority, in his own government; and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent di&s;|po&s;ition by a lively picture of the de&s;igns of Stili|cho, who already meditated the death of his &s;ove|reign, with the ambitious hope of placing the dia|dem on the head of his &s;on Eucherius.

<P>In the pa&s;&s;age of the emperor through Bologna, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;grace and death of Stilicho, A.

After this tumult, Honorius embraced, for the la&s;t time, the mini&s;ter whom he now con|&s;idered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to camp of Pavia; where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were a&s;|&s;embled for the &s;ervice of the Gallic war.

Many lives were lo&s;t; many hou&s;es were plunder|ed; the furious &s;edition continued to rage till the clo&s;e of the evening; and the trembling em|peror, who was &s;een in the &s;treets of Pavia, with|out his robes or diadem, yielded to the per&s;ua&s;ions of his favourite; condemned the memory of the &s;lain; and &s;olemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The intelligence of the ma&s;&s;acre of Pavia filled the mind of Stilicho with ju&s;t and gloomy apprehen&s;ions: and he in&s;tantly &s;ummoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the confederate leaders, who were attached to his &s;ervice, and would be involved in his ruin. The impetuous voice of the a&s;&s;embly called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a mo|ment's delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had &s;o often followed to victory; to &s;urpri&s;e, to oppre&s;s, to extirpate the guilty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. In&s;tead of executing a re&s;olution, which might have been ju&s;tified by &s;ucce&s;s, Stilicho he&s;itated till he was irrecoverably lo&s;t. He was &s;till igno|rant of the fate of the emperor; he di&s;tru&s;ted the fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal con&s;equences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians, again&s;t the &s;oldiers and people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of
<PB N="242" REF="250">
his timorous and doubtful delay, ha&s;tily retired, with fear and indignation. At the hour of mid|night, Sarus, a Gothic warrior, renowned among the Barbarians them&s;elves for his &s;trength and va|lour, &s;uddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his per&s;on, and penetrated to the tent, where the mini&s;ter, pen&s;ive and &s;leep|le&s;s, meditated on the dangers of his &s;ituation. Stilicho e&s;caped with difficulty from the &s;word of the Goths; and, after i&s;&s;uing a la&s;t and generous admonition to the cities of Italy, to &s;hut their gates again&s;t the Barbarians, his confidence, or his de&s;pair, urged him to throw him&s;elf into Ra|venna, which was already in the ab&s;olute po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his enemies. Olympius, who had a&s;|&s;umed the dominion of Honorius, was &s;peedily informed, that his rival had embraced, as a &s;up|pliant, the altar of the Chri&s;tian church. The ba&s;e and cruel di&s;po&s;ition of the hypocrite was in|capable of pity or remor&s;e; but he piou&s;ly af|fected to elude, rather than to violate, the pri|vilege of the &s;anctuary.

Exa&s;perated by &s;uch an injury, which might have awakened the tame&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ervile &s;pirit, they ca&s;t a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimou&s;ly &s;wore to pur&s;ue, with ju&s;t and implacable war, the perfidious nation, that had &s;o ba&s;ely violated the laws of ho&s;pitality.

prai&s;e and regret. The pre&s;&s;ing invitation of the malcontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively &s;en&s;e of his per&s;onal injuries; and he might &s;peciou&s;ly com|plain, that the Imperial mini&s;ters &s;till delayed and eluded the payment of the four thou&s;and pounds of gold; which had been granted by the Roman &s;enate, either to reward his &s;ervices, or to appea&s;e his fury. His decent firmne&s;s was &s;upported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;igns. He required a fair and rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction; but he gave the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that, as &s;oon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire. He refu&s;ed to tru&s;t the faith of the Romans, unle&s;s Aetius and Ja&s;on, the &s;ons of two great officers of &s;tate, were &s;ent as ho&s;tages to his camp: but he offered to de|liver, in exchange, &s;everal of the noble&s;t youths of the Gothic nation. The mode&s;ty of Alaric was interpreted, by the mini&s;ters of Ravenna, as a &s;ure evidence of his weakne&s;s and fear. They di&s;dained either to negociate a treaty, or to a&s;&s;emble an army; and with a ra&s;h confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably wa&s;ted the deci&s;ive moments of peace and war. While they expected, in &s;ullen &s;ilence, that the Barbarians &s;hould evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches, pa&s;&s;ed the Alps and the Po; ha&s;tily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increa&s;ed his forces by the acce&s;&s;ion of thirty thou&s;and

In&s;tead of attempting the hopele&s;s &s;iege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini, &s;tretched his ravages along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conque&s;t of the ancient mi&s;tre&s;s of the world.

The judicious reader will not always approve the a&s;perity of cen&s;ure, the choice of circum&s;tances, or the &s;tyle of expre&s;&s;ion: he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices, and per&s;onal re&s;entments, which &s;oured the temper of Am|mianus him&s;elf; but he will &s;urely ob&s;erve, with philo&s;ophic curio&s;ity, the intere&s;ting and original picture of the manners of Rome <NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">It is incumbent on me to explain the liberties which I have taken with the text of Ammianus. 1. I have melted down into one piece, the &s;ixth chapter of the fourteenth, and the fourth of the twenty-eighth, book. 2. I have given order and connection to the confu&s;ed ma&s;s of materials. 3. I have &s;oftened <HI>&s;ome</HI> extravagant hyperboles, and pared away &s;ome &s;uper&s;luities of the original. 4. I have developed &s;ome ob&s;ervations which were in&s;inuated, rather than expre&s;&s;ed. With the&s;e allowances, my ver&s;ion will be found, not literal indeed, but faithful and exact.</NOTE>.</P>

Ho&s;pitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every &s;tranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune, was relieved, or rewarded, by their genero&s;ity.

The fir&s;t emotions of the nobles, and of the people, were tho&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e and indignation, that a vile Barbarian &s;hould dare to in&s;ult the capital of the world: but their arrogance was &s;oon humbled by misfortune; and their unmanly rage, in&s;tead of being directed again&s;t an enemy in arms, was meanly exerci&s;ed on a defencele&s;s and innocent victim. Perhaps in the per&s;on of Serena, the Romans might have re&s;pected the niece of Theo|do&s;ius, the aunt, nay even the adoptive mother, of the reigning emperor: but they abhorred the widow of Stilicho; and they li&s;tened with cre|dulous pa&s;&s;ion to the tale of calumny, which ac|cu&s;ed her of maintaining a &s;ecret and criminal corre&s;pondence with the Gothic invader. Actu|ated, or overawed, by the &s;ame popular frenzy, the &s;enate, without requiring any evidence of her guilt, pronounced the &s;entence of her death. Serena was ignominiou&s;ly &s;trangled; and the infatuated multitude were a&s;toni&s;hed to find, that this cruel act of inju&s;tice did not immediately produce the retreat of the Barbarians, and the deliverance of the city. That unfortunate city <NOTE PLACE="marg">Famine.</NOTE>

The daily allowance of three pounds of bread was reduced to one-half, to one-third, to nothing; and the price of corn &s;till continued to ri&s;e in a rapid and extravagant proportion. The poorer citizens, who were unable to purcha&s;e the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, &s;olicited the precarious charity of the rich; and for a while the public mi&s;ery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta, the widow of the emperor Gratian, who had fixed her re&s;i|dence at Rome, and con&s;ecrated, to the u&s;e of the indigent, the princely revenue, which &s;he annually received from the grateful &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of her hu&s;band <NOTE N="74" PLACE="foot">The mother of Laeta was named Pi&s;&s;umena.

The la&s;t re&s;ource of the Romans was in the clemency, or at lea&s;t in the moderation, of the king of the Goths.

This important tru&s;t was delegated to Ba&s;ilius, a &s;enator, of Spani&s;h ex|traction, and already con&s;picuous in the admini|&s;tration of provinces; and to John, the fir&s;t tri|bune of the notaries, who was peculiarly qualified, by his dexterity in bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as by his for|mer intimacy with the Gothic prince. When they were introduced into his pre&s;ence, they de|clared, perhaps in a more lofty &s;tyle than became their abject condition, that the Romans were re&s;olved to maintain their dignity, either in peace or war; and that, if Alaric refu&s;ed them a fair and honourable capitulation, he might &s;ound his trumpets, and prepare to give battle to an innu|merable people, exerci&s;ed in arms, and animated by de&s;pair. <Q>"The thicker the hay, the ea&s;ier it is mowed,"</Q> was the conci&s;e reply of the Barbarian; and this ru&s;tic metaphor was accom|panied by a loud and in&s;ulting laugh, expre&s;&s;ive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace, enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine.

Several of the gates were cautiou&s;ly opened; the importation of provi&s;ions from the river, and the adjacent country, was no longer ob&s;tructed by the Goths; the citizens re&s;orted in crowds to the free market, which was held during three days in the &s;uburbs; and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade, made a con&s;iderable profit, the future &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the city was &s;ecured by the ample magazines which were depo&s;ited in the public and private granaries. A more regular di&s;cipline, than could have been expected, was maintained in the camp of Alaric; and the wi&s;e Barbarian ju&s;tified his regard for the faith of treaties, by the ju&s;t &s;everity with which he cha&s;ti&s;ed a party of licentious Goths, who had in&s;ulted &s;ome Roman citizens on the road to O&s;tia.

The king of the Goths repeatedly declared, that it was his de&s;ire to be con&s;idered as the friend of peace, and of the Romans.

If the&s;e mode&s;t terms &s;hould be rejected, Alaric &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to relinqui&s;h his pe|cuniary demands, and even to content him&s;elf with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Noricum; an exhau&s;ted and impoveri&s;hed country, perpetually expo&s;ed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">Zo&s;imus, l. v. p. 367, 368, 369.</NOTE>.

a &s;oldier of Barbarian origin, who &s;till adhered to the wor&s;hip of his ance&s;tors, had been oblig|ed to lay a&s;ide the military belt: and though he was repeatedly a&s;&s;ured by the emperor him&s;elf, that laws were not made for per&s;ons of his rank or merit, he refu&s;ed to accept any partial di&s;pen|&s;ation, and per&s;evered in honourable di&s;grace, till he had extorted a general act of ju&s;tice from the di&s;tre&s;s of the Roman government. The conduct of Gennerid, in the important &s;tation, to which he was promoted or re&s;tored, of ma&s;ter|general of Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Rhaetia, &s;eemed to revive the di&s;cipline and &s;pirit of the republic.

&s;ettlement of a colony. But the court and coun|cils of Honorius &s;till remained a &s;cene of weak|ne&s;s and di&s;traction, of corruption and anarchy. In&s;tigated by the praefect Jovius, the guards ro&s;e in furious mutiny, and demanded the heads of two generals, and of the two principal eunuchs. The generals, under a perfidious promi&s;e of &s;afe|ty, were &s;ent on &s;hip-board, and privately exe|cuted; while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and &s;ecure exile at Milan and Con|&s;tantinople. Eu&s;ebius the eunuch, and the Bar|barian Allobich, &s;ucceeded to the command of the bed-chamber and of the guards; and the mu|tual jealou&s;y of the&s;e &s;ubordinate mini&s;ters was the cau&s;e of their mutual de&s;truction. By the in&s;olent order of the count of the dome&s;tics, the great chamberlain was &s;hamefully beaten to death with &s;ticks, before the eyes of the a&s;toni&s;hed emperor; and the &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Allobich, in the mid&s;t of a public proce&s;&s;ion, is the only circum&s;tance of his life, in which Ho|norius di&s;covered the fainte&s;t &s;ymptom of courage or re&s;entment.

During the ab&s;ence of Jovius, the em|peror was per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;ume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity, &s;uch as neither his &s;ituation, nor his character, could enable him to &s;upport: and a letter, &s;igned with the name of Honorius,

was immediately di&s;patched to the Praetorian praefect, granting him a free permi&s;&s;ion to di&s;|po&s;e of the public money, but &s;ternly refu&s;ing to pro&s;titute the military honours of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian. This letter was imprudently communicated to Alaric him&s;elf; and the Goth, who in the whole tran&s;action had behaved with temper and decency, expre&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t outrageous language, his lively &s;en&s;e of the in&s;ult &s;o wantonly offered to his per&s;on, and to his nation. The conference of Rimini was ha&s;tily interrupted; and the praefect Jovius, on his return to Ravenna, was compelled to adopt, and even to encourage, the fa&s;hionable opinions of the court.

To the&s;e valiant &s;trangers, who&s;e fidelity had not been corrupted by the fac|tions of the court, he committed the walls and gates of the city; and the &s;lumbers of the empe|ror were no longer di&s;turbed by the apprehen&s;ion of imminent and internal danger. The favour|able intelligence which was received from Africa, &s;uddenly changed the opinions of men, and the &s;tate of public affairs. The troops and officers, whom Attalus had &s;ent into that province, were defeated and &s;lain; and the active zeal of Hera|clian maintained his own allegiance, and that of his people. The faithful count of Africa tran&s;|mitted a large &s;um of money, which fixed the attachment of the Imperial guards; and his vigi|lance, in preventing the exportation of corn and oil, introduced famine, tumult, and di&s;content, into the walls of Rome. The failure of the

The mo&s;t imprudent mea&s;ures were adopted, without the knowledge, or again&s;t the advice, of Alaric; and the ob&s;tinate refu&s;al of the &s;enate, to allow, in the embarkation, the mixture even of five hundred Goths, betrayed a &s;u&s;picious and di&s;tru&s;tful temper, which, in their &s;ituation, was neither generous nor prudent. The re&s;entment of the Gothic king was exa&s;perated by the mali|cious arts of Jovius, who had been rai&s;ed to the rank of patrician, and who afterwards excu&s;ed his double perfidy, by declaring, without a blu&s;h, that he had only <HI>&s;eemed</HI> to abandon the &s;ervice of Honorius, more effectually to ruin the cau&s;e of the u&s;urper. In a large plain near Rimini, and in the pre&s;ence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barbarians, the wretched Attalus was publicly de&s;poiled of the diadem and purple; and tho&s;e en&s;igns of royalty were &s;ent by Alaric, as the pledge of peace and friend&s;hip, to the &s;on of Theodo&s;ius <NOTE N="94" PLACE="foot">See the cau&s;e and circum&s;tances of the fall of Attalus in Zo&s;i|mus, l. vi. p. 380&mdash;383.

But when the trumpet &s;ummoned him to arms; when he mounted his hor&s;e, and, bending down (for &s;uch was his &s;ingular practice) almo&s;t upon the neck, fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field, Con&s;tantius then &s;truck terror into his foes, and in&s;pired his &s;oldiers with the a&s;&s;urance of victory. He had received from the court of Ra|venna the important commi&s;&s;ion of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the We&s;t; and the pretended emperor Con&s;tantine, after enjoying a &s;hort and anxious re&s;pite, was again be&s;ieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy. Yet this interval allowed time for a &s;ucce&s;sful negociation with the Franks and Ale|manni; and his amba&s;&s;ador, Edobic, &s;oon re|turned, at the head of an army, to di&s;turb the operations of the &s;iege of Arles. The Roman general, in&s;tead of expecting the attack in his lines, boldly, and perhaps wi&s;ely, re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Rh&ocirc;ne, and to meet the Barbarians. His mea&s;ures were conducted with &s;o much &s;kill and &s;ecrecy, that, while they engaged the infantry of Con&s;tantius in the front, they were &s;uddenly at|tacked, &s;urrounded, and de&s;troyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas, who had &s;ilently gained an advantageous po&s;t in their rear. The remains of the army of Edobic were pre&s;erved by flight or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and their leader e&s;caped from the field of battle to the hou&s;e of a faithle&s;s friend; who too clearly under&s;tood, that the head of his

obnoxious gue&s;t would be an acceptable and lu|crative pre&s;ent for the Imperial general. On this occa&s;ion, Con&s;tantius behaved with the magna|nimity of a genuine Roman. Subduing, or &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing, every &s;entiment of jealou&s;y, he publicly acknowledged the merit and &s;ervices of Ulphilas: but he turned with horror from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of Edobic; and &s;ternly intimated his commands, that the camp &s;hould no longer be polluted by the pre&s;ence of an ungrateful wretch, who had violated the laws of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality. The u&s;urper, who beheld, from the walls of Arles, the ruin of his la&s;t hopes, was tempted to place &s;ome confidence in &s;o generous a conqueror.

Before Con&s;tantine re&s;igned the pur|ple, and in the fourth month of the &s;iege of Arles, intelligence was received in the Imperial camp, that Jovinus had a&s;&s;umed the diadem at Mentz, in the Upper Germany, at the in&s;tigation of Goar, king of the Alani, and of Guntiarius, king of the Burgundians; and that the candidate, on whom they had be&s;towed the empire, ad|vanced, with a formidable ho&s;t of Barbarians, from the banks of the Rhine to tho&s;e of the Rh&ocirc;ne. Every circum&s;tance is dark and extraor|dinary in the &s;hort hi&s;tory of the reign of Jovinus. It was natural to expect, that a brave and &s;kilful general, at the head of a victorious army, would have a&s;&s;erted, in a field of battle, the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e of Honorius. The ha&s;ty retreat of Con&s;tantius might be ju&s;tified by weighty rea|&s;ons; but he re&s;igned, without a &s;truggle, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gaul: and Dardanus, the Praetorian praefect, is recorded as the only magi&s;trate, who refu&s;ed to yield obedience to the u&s;urper <NOTE N="152" PLACE="foot">Sidonius Apollinaris (l. v. epi&s;t. 9. p. 139. and Not.

When the Goths, two years after the &s;iege of Rome, e&s;tabli&s;hed their quarters in Gaul, it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius, with whom they had formed a recent alliance, and the degraded Attalus, whom they re&s;erved in their camp for the occa&s;ional purpo&s;e of acting the part of a mu&s;ician or a monarch. Yet in a moment of di&s;gu&s;t (for which it is not ea&s;y to a&s;|&s;ign a cau&s;e, or a date), Adolphus connected him&s;elf with the u&s;urper of Gaul; and impo&s;ed on Attalus the ignominious ta&s;k of negociating the treaty, which ratified his own di&s;grace. We are again &s;urpri&s;ed to read, that, in&s;tead of con|&s;idering the Gothic alliance as the firme&s;t &s;upport of his throne, Jovinus upbraided, in dark and ambiguous language, the officious importunity of Attalus; that, &s;corning the advice of his great ally, he inve&s;ted with the purple his brother Se|ba&s;tian; and that he mo&s;t imprudently accepted the &s;ervice of Sarus, when that gallant chief, the &s;oldier of Honorius, was provoked to de&s;ert the court of a prince, who knew not how to reward, or puni&s;h. Adolphus, educated among a race of warriors, who e&s;teemed the duty of revenge as the mo&s;t precious and &s;acred portion of their in|heritance, advanced with a body of ten thou&s;and Goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the hou&s;e of Balti.

The king of the Goths executed his promi&s;e without difficulty or delay: the helple&s;s brothers, un&s;upported by any per|&s;onal merit, were abandoned by their Barbarian auxiliaries; and the &s;hort oppo&s;ition of Valentia was expiated by the ruin of one of the noble&s;t cities of Gaul.

The royal guar|dian accepted and di&s;charged this honourable tru&s;t with unexampled fidelity; and the infancy of Theodo&s;ius was protected by the arms and councils of Per&s;ia.

But the weakne&s;s of Honorius, and the calamities of his reign, di&s;qualified him from pro&s;ecuting this natural claim; and &s;uch was the ab&s;olute &s;eparation of the two monarchies, both in intere&s;t and affection, that Con&s;tantinople would have obeyed, with le&s;s reluctance, the orders of the Per&s;ian, than tho&s;e of the Italian, court.

The elegant and fa|miliar u&s;e which &s;he had acquired, both of the Greek and Latin languages, was readily applied to the various occa&s;ions of &s;peaking, or writing, on public bu&s;ine&s;s: her deliberations were ma|turely weighed; her actions were prompt and de|ci&s;ive; and, while &s;he moved without noi&s;e or o&s;tentation the wheel of government, &s;he di&s;|creetly attributed to the genius of the emperor, the long tranquillity of his reign.

<P>The Roman world was deeply intere&s;ted in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Education and cha|racter of Theodo|&s;ius the younger.</NOTE> education of its ma&s;ter. A regular cour&s;e of &s;tudy and exerci&s;e was judiciou&s;ly in&s;tituted; of

The ample lei&s;ure, which he acquired by neglecting the e&s;|&s;ential duties of his high office, was filled by idle amu&s;ements, and unprofitable &s;tudies. Hunting was the only active pur&s;uit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly laboured, &s;ometimes by the light of a midnight lamp, in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the elegance with which he tran&s;cribed religious books, entitled the Roman emperor to the &s;ingular epithet of <HI>Calligraphes,</HI> or a fair writer. Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil, Theodo&s;ius tru&s;ted the per&s;ons whom he loved; he loved tho&s;e who were accu&s;tomed to amu&s;e and flatter his indolence; and as he never peru&s;ed the pa|pers that were pre&s;ented for the royal &s;ignature, the acts of inju&s;tice the mo&s;t repugnant to his character, were frequently perpetrated in his name. The emperor him&s;elf was cha&s;te, tem|perate, liberal, and merciful; but the&s;e qua|lities, which can only de&s;erve the name of vir|tues, when they are &s;upported by courage, and

She ea&s;ily excited the curio&s;ity of her bro|ther, by an intere&s;ting picture of the charms of Athenais; large eyes, a well-proportioned no&s;e, a fair complexion, golden locks, a &s;lender per&s;on, a graceful demeanour, an under&s;tanding improv|ed by &s;tudy, and a virtue tried by di&s;tre&s;s, Theodo&s;ius, concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his &s;i&s;ter, was permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the mode&s;t youth imme|diately declared his pure and honourable love; and the royal nuptials were celebrated amid&s;t the acclamations of the capital and the provinces. Athenais, who was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to renounce the errors of Pagani&s;m, received at her bapti&s;m the Chri&s;tian name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of Augu&s;ta, till the wife of Theodo&s;ius had approved her fruitfulne&s;s by the birth of a daughter, who e&s;pou&s;ed, fifteen years afterwards, the emperor of the We&s;t. The

The remainder of the life of Eudocia, about &s;ixteen years, was &s;pent in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of Theodo&s;ius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a captive from Rome to Carthage, and the &s;ociety of the Holy Monks of Pale&s;tine, in&s;en&s;ibly con|firmed the religious temper of her mind. After a full experience of the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life, the daughter of the philo&s;opher Leontius expired, at Jeru&s;alem, in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of her age; prote&s;ting with her dying breath,

<P>The gentle mind of Theodo&s;ius was never in|flamed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per|&s;ian war, A. D. 422.</NOTE> by the ambition of conque&s;t, or military renown; and the &s;light alarm of a Per&s;ian war &s;carcely interrupted the tranquillity of the Ea&s;t. The motives of this war were ju&s;t and honourable. In the la&s;t year of the reign of Jezdegerd, the &s;uppo&s;ed guardian of Theodo&s;ius, a bi&s;hop, who a&s;pired to the crown of martyrdom, de&s;troyed one of the fire-temples of Su&s;a <NOTE N="80" PLACE="foot">Theodoret, l. v. c. 39. Tillemont, Mem. Eccle&s;. tom. xii. p. 356&mdash;364. A&s;&s;emanni, bibliot. Oriental. tom. iii. p. 396. tom. iv. p. 61. Theodoret blames the ra&s;hne&s;s of Abdas, but extols the con&s;tancy of his martyrdom. Yet I do not clearly under&s;tand the ca&s;ui&s;try which prohibits our repairing the damage which we have unlawfully committed.</NOTE>. His zeal and ob|&s;tinacy were revenged on his brethren: the Magi excited a cruel per&s;ecution; and the intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his &s;on Vara|ranes, or Bahram, who &s;oon afterwards a&s;cended the throne. Some Chri&s;tian fugitives, who e&s;caped to the Roman frontier, were &s;ternly de|manded, and generou&s;ly refu&s;ed; and the refu&s;al, aggravated by commercial di&s;putes, &s;oon kindled a war between the rival monarchies. The moun|tains of Armenia, and the plains of Me&s;opotamia,
<PB N="427" REF="435">
were filled with ho&s;tile armies; but the operations of two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive campaigns were not productive of any deci&s;ive or memorable events. Some en|gagements were fought, &s;ome towns were be&s;ieg|ed, with various and doubtful &s;ucce&s;s; and if the Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ni&s;ibis, the Per&s;ians were repul&s;ed from the walls of a Me&s;opotamian city, by the valour of a martial bi&s;hop, who pointed his thundering engine in the name of St. Thomas the Apo&s;tle. Yet the &s;plendid victories, which the incredible &s;peed of the me&s;&s;enger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of Con&s;tan|tinople, were celebrated with fe&s;tivals and pane|gyrics. From the&s;e panegyrics the <NOTE N="81" PLACE="foot">Socrates (l. vii. c. 18, 19, 20, 21.) is the be&s;t author for the Per&s;ian war.

Such events may be di&s;believed, or di&s;regarded; but the charity of a bi&s;hop, Acacius of Amida, who&s;e name might have dignified the &s;aintly calendar, &s;hall not be lo&s;t in oblivion. Boldly declaring, that va&s;es of gold and &s;ilver are u&s;ele&s;s to a God

The practice of benevolence in the mid&s;t of war mu&s;t always tend to a&s;&s;uage the animo&s;ity of contend|ing nations; and I wi&s;h to per&s;uade my&s;elf, that Acacius contributed to the re&s;toration of peace. In the conference which was held on the limits of the two empires, the Roman amba&s;&s;adors degrad|ed the per&s;onal character of their &s;overeign, by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power; when they &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;ed the Per&s;ians to pre|vent, by a timely accommodation, the wrath of a monarch, who was yet ignorant of this di&s;tant war. A truce of one hundred years was &s;olemnly ratified; and, although the revolutions of Ar|menia might threaten the public tranquillity, the e&s;&s;ential conditions of this treaty were re&s;pected near four&s;core years by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Con&s;tan|tine and Artaxerxes.</P>

The le&s;s fortunate nobles, who lamented the lo&s;s of their king, and envied the honours of their equals, were provoked to nego|ciate their peace and pardon at the Per&s;ian court; and returning, with their followers, to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Cho&s;roes for their law|ful &s;overeign. About thirty years afterwards, Arta&s;ires, the nephew and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Cho&s;roes, fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the haughty and ca|pricious nobles of Armenia; and they unani|mou&s;ly de&s;ired a Per&s;ian governor in the room of an unworthy king.
