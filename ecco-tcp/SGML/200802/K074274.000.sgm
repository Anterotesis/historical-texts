<HEAD>A DISSERTATION CONCERNING THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF DESPOTISM IN HINDOSTAN.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The climate and &s;oil of India,</NOTE>GOVERNMENT derives its form from acci|dent; its &s;pirit and genius from the inherent man|ners  of the people. The languor occa&s;ioned by the hot climate of India, inclines the native to indolence and ea&s;e; and he thinks the evils of de&s;poti&s;m le&s;s &s;evere than the labour of being free. Tranquillity is the chief object of his de&s;ires. His happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in a mere ab&s;ence of mi&s;ery; and oppre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t degenerate into a folly, which defeats its own ends before he calls it by the name of inju&s;tice. The&s;e phlegmatic &s;entiments the Indian
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
carries into his future &s;tate. He thinks it a mode of be|ing, in which pa&s;&s;ion is lo&s;t, and every faculty of the &s;oul &s;u&s;pended, except the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">favourable to de&s;poti&s;m.</NOTE>Other motives of pa&s;&s;ive obedience join i&s;&s;ue with the love of ea&s;e. The &s;un, which enervates his body, pro|duces  for him, in a manner &s;pontaneou&s;ly, the various fruits of the earth. He finds &s;ub&s;i&s;tence without much toil; he requires little covering but the &s;hade. The chill bla&s;t of winter is unknown; the &s;ea&s;ons are only marked by an arbitrary number of nights and days. Property being in &s;ome mea&s;ure unnece&s;&s;ary, becomes of little value; and men &s;ubmit, without re&s;i&s;tance, to vio|lations of right, which may hurt but cannot de&s;troy them. Their religious in&s;titutions incline them to peace and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The vulgar live with the au&s;terity of philo&s;ophers, as well as with the ab&s;tinence of devotees. Aver&s;e them&s;elves to the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes, they re|&s;ent no injuries from others; and their low diet cools their temper to a degree which pa&s;&s;ion cannot inflame.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Encourage conque&s;t.</NOTE>The fertility of the &s;oil, which in other kingdoms con&s;titutes the great pro&s;perity of the natives, was a  &s;ource of misfortune to the Indians. Notwith&s;tanding their ab&s;tinence and indolence, they were in &s;ome degree indu&s;trious, and, in want of but few things them&s;elves,
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
their own arts, and the natural productions of their country, rendered them opulent. Wealth accumulated, in the progre&s;s of time, upon their hands; and they became objects of depredation to the fierce nations of the northern A&s;ia. The facility of incur&s;ion, among a peaceable and harmle&s;s race of men, encouraged con|que&s;t. The victors, in&s;tead of carrying the &s;poil into their native country, &s;at down where it had been found; and added the mini&s;tration of the conquered to the other enjoyments of wealth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;ia always the &s;eat of &s;lavery.</NOTE>A&s;ia, the &s;eat of the greate&s;t empires, has been al|ways  the nur&s;e of the mo&s;t abject &s;laves. The moun|tains of Per&s;ia have not been able to &s;top the progre&s;s of the tide of de&s;poti&s;m; neither has it been frozen in its cour&s;e through the plains of the northern Tartary, by the chill air of the North. But though de&s;poti&s;m go|verns A&s;ia, it appears in different countries under va|rious forms. The Arabs of the de&s;art alone po&s;&s;e&s;s liberty, on account of the &s;terility of their &s;oil. Inde|pendent of revolution and change, they &s;ee, with un|concern, empires falling and ri&s;ing around. They re|main unconquered by arms, by luxury, by corruption; they alter not their language, they adhere to their cu&s;toms and manners, they retain their dre&s;s. Their whole property con&s;i&s;ts of flocks and herds, of their
<PB N="x" REF="7">
tents and arms. They annually make a &s;mall and vo|luntary pre&s;ent to the chief of their blood. They revolt again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion; and they are free by nece&s;&s;ity, which they mi&s;take for choice. When men are obliged to wander for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, de&s;poti&s;m knows not where to find its &s;laves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Tartar</NOTE>The Tartar, though a wanderer like the Arab, was  never equally free. A violent ari&s;tocracy always pre|vailed in the country of the former, except in a few &s;hort periods, when the fortune of one e&s;tabli&s;hed a tran&s;ient de&s;poti&s;m over the whole. There man is armed again&s;t man, chief again&s;t chief, and tribe again&s;t tribe. War is no longer a particular profe&s;&s;ion, but the con&s;tant occupation of all. Men are more afraid of men in the &s;olitudes of Tartary, than of bea&s;ts of prey. The traveller moves with great circum&s;pection, and hears an enemy in every bla&s;t of wind. When he &s;ees a tract in the &s;and, he cro&s;&s;es it, and begins to draw his &s;word. Though the barrenne&s;s of the country has pre|vented the growth or introduction of luxury, avarice prevails, and he that has the lea&s;t to lo&s;e is the mo&s;t independent, where life is invariably ri&s;qued for a tri|fling &s;poil. Robbery acquires the more honourable name of Conque&s;t; and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is dignified with the title of Warrior.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="8">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Afgan ari&s;toeracies.</NOTE>In the mountains which &s;eparate Per&s;ia from India,  the nature and face of the country have formed a dif|ferent &s;pecies of &s;ociety. Every valley contains a com|munity &s;ubject to a prince, who&s;e de&s;poti&s;m is tempered, by an idea e&s;tabli&s;hed among his people, that he is the chief of their blood, as well as their &s;overeign. They obey him without reluctance, as they derive credit to their family from his greatne&s;s. They attend him in his wars, with the attachment which children have for a parent; and his government, though &s;evere, partakes more of the rigid di&s;cipline of a general, than of the caprice of a de&s;pot. Rude as the face of their country, and fierce and wild as the &s;torms which cover their mountains, they love incur&s;ion and depredation, and delight in plunder and in battle. United firmly to their friends in war, to their enemies faithle&s;s and cruel. They place ju&s;tice in force, and conceal treachery under the name of addre&s;s. Such are the Afgans or Patans, who conquered India and held it for ages.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;poti&s;m of the Patans different</NOTE>The de&s;poti&s;m which the Patans e&s;tabli&s;hed in their  conque&s;ts, partook of the violence of their national cha|racter at home. Their government was oppre&s;&s;ive through pride, and tyrannical from pa&s;&s;ion rather than from avarice. Reinforced by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive migrations from the mountains of Afgani&s;t&acirc;n, they retained their native
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
&s;pirit in the mid&s;t of the luxuries of India. When the monarch became voluptuous and degenerate, they &s;up|plied his place with &s;ome hardy chieftain from the north, who communicated his own vigour to the great machine of the &s;tate. The empire was &s;upported by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of abilities, rather than by an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes; and it was the countrymen, and not the po&s;te|rity of the fir&s;t conquerors, who continued the domi|nion of the Pat&acirc;ns over India.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">from that of the Moguls.</NOTE>The conque&s;t of India by the family of Timur, pro|ceeded  from the abilities of one man, and not from the effort of a nation. Baber him&s;elf was a &s;tranger in the country in which he reigned, before he penetrated be|yond the Indus. His troops con&s;i&s;ted of &s;oldiers of for|tune, from various countries; his officers were men who owed their rank to merit, not to &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The religion of Mahommed, which they in common pro|fe&s;&s;ed, and their obedience to one leader, were the only ties which united the conquerors upon their arrival; and they were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated in the exten&s;ive dominions which their arms &s;ubdued. The character of the prince went down on the current of government; and the mild di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors contributed to confirm the humane de&s;poti&s;m which he had introduced into his conque&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="10">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;e of that difference,</NOTE>A continued influx of &s;trangers from the northern  A&s;ia, became nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of princes who profe&s;&s;ed a different faith with their &s;ubjects, in the va&s;t empire of India. The army was recruited with &s;oldiers from different nations; the court was occupied by nobles from various kingdoms. The latter were fol|lowers of the Mahommedan religion. In the regula|tions and &s;pirit of the Coran, they lo&s;t their primary and characteri&s;tical ideas upon government; and the whole &s;y&s;tem was formed and enlivened by the limited principles which Mahommed promulgated in the de|&s;arts of Arabia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">from their religion.</NOTE>The faith of Mahommed is peculiarly calculated for  de&s;poti&s;m; and it is one of the greate&s;t cau&s;es which mu&s;t fix for ever the duration of that &s;pecies of govern|ment in the Ea&s;t. The legi&s;lator furni&s;hes a proof of this po&s;ition in his own conduct. He derived his &s;uc|ce&s;s from the &s;word, more than from his eloquence and addre&s;s. The tyranny which he e&s;tabli&s;hed was of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive kind. He en&s;laved the mind as well as the body. The abrupt argument of the &s;word brought conviction, when per&s;ua&s;ion and delu&s;ion failed. He ef|fected a revolution and change in the human mind, as well as in &s;tates and empires; and the ambitious will continue to &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> a &s;y&s;tem which lays its &s;oundation
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">
on the pa&s;&s;ive obedience of tho&s;e whom Fortune has once placed beneath their power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;poti&s;m</NOTE>The unlimited power which Mahommedani&s;m gives  to every man in his own family, habituates mankind to &s;lavery. Every child is taught, from his infancy, to look upon his father as the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;er of life and death. The number of wives and concubines which the more wealthy and powerful entertain, is a cau&s;e of animo&s;ity and quarrel, which nothing but a &s;evere and unaccount|able power in the ma&s;ter of a family can repre&s;s. This private &s;pecies of de&s;poti&s;m is, in miniature, the counter|part of what prevails in the &s;tate; and it has the &s;ame effect, in reducing all the pa&s;&s;ions under the dominion of fear. Jealou&s;y it&s;elf, that mo&s;t violent of the feelings of the &s;oul, is curbed within the walls of the haram. The women may pine in &s;ecret, but they mu&s;t clothe their features with cheerfulne&s;s when their lord appears. Contumacy is productive of immediate puni&s;hment. They are degraded, divorced, cha&s;ti&s;ed, and even &s;ome|times put to death, according to the degree of their crime or ob&s;tinacy, or the wrath of the offended hu&s;|band. No enquiry is made concerning their fate. Their friends may murmur; but the laws provide no redre&s;s; for no appeals to public ju&s;tice i&s;&s;ue forth from the ha|ram.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="12">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the ma&s;ters of families.</NOTE>Young men, with their minds moulded to &s;ubjection,  become them&s;elves ma&s;ters of families in the cour&s;e of time. Their power being confined within their own walls, they exerci&s;e in private, that de&s;poti&s;m which they in public dread. But though they are freed from do|me&s;tic tyranny, they &s;till continue &s;laves. Governors, magi&s;trates, and inferior officers, inve&s;ted with the power of the principal de&s;pot, who&s;e will is law to the empire, exerci&s;e their authority with rigour. The idea of pa&s;&s;ive obedience is carried through every vein of the &s;tate. The machine connected in all its parts, by arbi|trary &s;way, is moved by the active &s;pirit of the prince; and the lenity or oppre&s;&s;ivene&s;s of government, in all its departments depends upon the natural di&s;po&s;ition of his mind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of com|pen&s;ation for murder.</NOTE>The law of compen&s;ation for murder, authori&s;ed by  the Coran, is attended with pernicious effects. It de|pre&s;&s;es the &s;pirit of the poor; and encourages the rich in the unmanly pa&s;&s;ion of revenge. The price of blood in India is not the third part of the value of a hor&s;e. The innate principles of ju&s;tice and humanity are weakened, by the&s;e means; &s;ecurity is taken from &s;ociety, as rage may frequently get the better of the love of money. A religion which indulges individuals in a crime, at which the re&s;t of mankind &s;hudder, leaves ample room for the
<PB N="xvi" REF="13">
cruelty of a prince. Accu&s;tomed to &s;it in judgment on criminals, he becomes habituated to death. He mi&s;takes pa&s;&s;ion for ju&s;tice. His nod is condemnation; men are dragged to execution, with an abruptne&s;s which prevents fear. The incident has no con&s;equence, but to impre&s;s terror on the guilty or &s;u&s;pected; and the &s;pectators &s;carcely heed a circum&s;tance, which its frequency has made them to expect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bathing.</NOTE>The frequent bathing inculcated by the Coran, has,  by debilitating the body, a great effect on the mind. Habit makes the warm bath a luxury of a bewitching kind. The women &s;pend whole days in water; and ha&s;ten by it the approach of age. The indolence of the men, which induces them to follow every mode of pla|cid plea&s;ure, recommends to them a practice which Ma|hommed has made a tenet of religion. The prohibition of wine is al&s;o favourable to de&s;poti&s;m. It prevents that free communication of &s;entiment which awakens man|kind from a torpid indifference to their natural rights. They become cold, timid, cautious, re&s;erved and inte|re&s;ted; &s;trangers to tho&s;e warm pa&s;&s;ions, and that cheer|ful elevation of mind, which render men in &s;ome mea|&s;ure hone&s;t and &s;incere. In the Ea&s;t, there are no pub|lic places of meeting, no communications of &s;entiments, no introduction to private friend&s;hip. A fullenne&s;s, and
<PB N="xvii" REF="14">
a love of retirement prevail, which di&s;unite mankind; and as all a&s;&s;ociations among men are prevented, the hands of government are &s;trengthened by the very virtue of temperance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prede&s;tina|tion.</NOTE>The doctrine of a rigid fate, or ab&s;olute prede&s;tina|tion,  which forms one of the principal tenets of the Ma|hommedan religion, has a great influence on the charac|ter and manners of men. When this opinion is adopt|ed as an article of faith, the nece&s;&s;ity of precaution is in|culcated in vain. The fatali&s;t begins an action becau&s;e human nature is incapable of ab&s;olute idlene&s;s; but when a love of repo&s;e invites him, when an ob&s;tacle ari&s;es before him to thwart his de&s;igns, he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o motive for per&s;everance. He waits for another day, perhaps for another month: he at la&s;t tru&s;ts the whole to Provi|dence, and makes God the agent in his very crimes. Mi&s;carriage can be no di&s;grace where &s;ucce&s;s depends not on abilities; and the general who lo&s;es a battle through his own pu&s;illanimity, lays the blame upon Providence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Polygamy.</NOTE>The exten&s;ive polygamy permitted by the law of Ma|hommed, has a fatal effect on the minds of his follow|ers;  but it has its advantages as well as its defects. The peculiar nature of the climate &s;ubjects women to di&s;|ea&s;es,
<PB N="xviii" REF="15">
and hurries them forward in a few years to age. One man retains his vigour beyond the common &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of three women through their prime; and the law for a multiplicity of wives is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;up|port of the human race. But the cu&s;tom weakens pa|ternal affection; for as a hu&s;band cannot equally divide his regard among many women, the children of the fa|vourite will be preferred. Even the&s;e will not be much beloved. The lo&s;s of a child is no misfortune; and the care of pre&s;erving it is le&s;&s;ened, by the opportunity which the number of his women furni&s;hes to the father for begetting more. The child him&s;elf is no &s;tranger to this indifference; and he fails in proportion in his duty. Be&s;ides, the jealou&s;y between mothers in the haram grows into hatred among their &s;ons. The af|fection between brothers is annihilated at home; and when they i&s;&s;ue forth into the world, they carry their animo&s;ities into all the various tran&s;actions of life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Concealment of women.</NOTE>The&s;e religious tenets, which are &s;o favourable to  de&s;poti&s;m, are accompanied with &s;ingular opinions and cu&s;toms, which are ab&s;olute enemies to freedom and in|dependence. The concealment of their women is &s;a|cred among the Mahommedans. Brothers cannot vi&s;it them in private; &s;trangers mu&s;t never &s;ee them. This exce&s;&s;ive jealou&s;y is derived from various cau&s;es. It
<PB N="xix" REF="16">
proceeds from religion, which inculcates female mo|de&s;ty; it ari&s;es partly from the policy of government; it is derived from the nature of the climate, where con|tinence is a more arduous virtue than in the bleak re|gions of the north. Honour con&s;i&s;ts in that which men are mo&s;t &s;olicitous to &s;ecure. The cha&s;tity of his wives is a point, without which the A&s;iatic mu&s;t not live. The de&s;pot encourages the opinion; as the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the women of his mo&s;t powerful &s;ubjects is a &s;ufficient pledge for their faith, when ab&s;ent in expedi|tion and war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its effect</NOTE>When the governor of a province falls under the &s;u&s;|picion  of di&s;affection for his prince, the fir&s;t &s;tep taken again&s;t him, is an order i&s;&s;ued for &s;ending his women to court. Even one of his wives, and &s;he too not the be&s;t beloved, will bind him to his allegiance. His obedi|ence to this mandate is the true te&s;t of his de&s;igns. If he in&s;tantly obeys, all &s;u&s;picions vani&s;h; if he he&s;itates a moment, he is declared a rebel. His affection for the woman is not the pledge of his fidelity; but his honour is, in her per&s;on, in the cu&s;tody of his &s;ove|reign. Women are &s;o &s;acred in India, that even the common &s;oldiery leave them unmole&s;ted in the mid&s;t of &s;laughter and deva&s;tation. The haram is a &s;anctua|ry again&s;t all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of victory; and ruf|fians,
<PB N="xx" REF="17">
covered with the blood of a hu&s;band, &s;hrink back with confu&s;ion from the &s;ecret apartments of his wives.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on their manners.</NOTE>In the &s;ilence which attends de&s;poti&s;m, every thing  is dark and &s;olemn. Ju&s;tice it&s;elf is executed with pri|vacy; and &s;ometimes a &s;olitary gun, fired at midnight from the palace of the de&s;pot, proclaims the work of death. Men indulge them&s;elves under the veil of &s;e|crecy; and rejoice in their good fortune, when their plea&s;ures can e&s;cape the eye of their prince. Volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s is, therefore, preferred to luxury. The en|joyment of the company of women is the chief object of life among the great; and when they retire into the &s;anctuary of the haram, they forget, in a variety of charms, their precarious &s;ituation in the &s;tate. The nece&s;&s;ary privacy enhances the indulgence; and the ex|treme &s;en&s;ibility, perhaps, peculiar to the natives of a hot climate, carries plea&s;ure to an exce&s;s which unmans the mind. Men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;omething which they are afraid to lo&s;e; and de&s;poti&s;m, which is founded on the principles of fear and indolence, derives &s;tability and permanency from the defects and vices of its &s;laves.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE>The &s;eeds of de&s;poti&s;m, which the nature of the cli|mate and fertility of the &s;oil had &s;own in India, were, 
<PB N="xxi" REF="18">
as has been ob&s;erved, reared to perfect growth by the Mahommedan faith. When a people have been long &s;ubjected to arbitrary power, their return to liberty is arduous and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. Slavery, by the &s;trength of cu&s;tom, is blended with human nature; and that undefined &s;omething, called Public Virtue, exi&s;ts no more. The &s;ubject never thinks of reformation; and the prince, who only has it in his power, will intro|duce no innovations to abridge his own authority. Were even the de&s;pot po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the enthu&s;ia&s;m of public &s;pirit, the people would revolt again&s;t the intro|duction of freedom; and revert to that form of govern|ment, which takes the trouble of regulation from their hands.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the nature</NOTE>The &s;implicity of de&s;poti&s;m recommends it to an in|dolent  and ignorant race of men. Its obvious impar|tiality, its prompt ju&s;tice, its immediate &s;everity again&s;t crimes, dazzle the eyes of the &s;uperficial, and rai&s;e in their minds a veneration little &s;hort of idolatry for their prince. When he is active and determined in his mea|&s;ures, the great machine moves with a velocity which throws vigour into the very extremities of the empire. His violence, and even his caprices, are virtues, where the waters mu&s;t be always agitated to pre&s;erve their fre&s;hne&s;s; and indolence and irre&s;olution can be his
<PB N="xxii" REF="19">
only ruinous vices. The fir&s;t indeed may injure the &s;tate; but by the latter it mu&s;t be undone. A &s;evere prince, by his jealou&s;y of his own authority, prevents the tyranny of others; and, though fierce and arbitrary in him&s;elf, the &s;ubject derives a benefit from his being the &s;ole de&s;pot. His rage falls heavy on the dignified &s;laves of his pre&s;ence; but the people e&s;cape his fury in their di&s;tance from his hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of de&s;poti&s;m.</NOTE>The de&s;potic form of government is not, however,  &s;o terrible in its nature, as men born in free countries are apt to imagine. Though no civil regulation can bind the prince, there is one great law, the ideas of mankind with regard to right and wrong, by which he is bound. When he becomes an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, he teaches others to u&s;e the dagger again&s;t him&s;elf; and wanton acts of inju&s;tice, often repeated, de&s;troy by degrees that opinion which is the &s;ole &s;oundation of his power. In the indifference of his &s;ubjects for his per&s;on and government, he becomes liable to the con&s;piracies of courtiers, and the ambitious &s;chemes of his relations. He may have many &s;laves, but he can have no friends. His per&s;on is expo&s;ed to injury. A certainty of impunity may arm even cowards again&s;t him; and thus, by his exce&s;&s;ive ardour for power, he with his authority lo&s;es his life.</P>

The uncommon abilities of mo&s;t of the princes, with the mild and humane cha|racter of all, rendered Hindo&s;tan the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing empire in the world during two complete centuries. The manly and generous temper of Baber permitted not oppre&s;&s;ion to attend the victories of his &s;word. He came with an intention to govern the nations whom he &s;ubdued; and &s;elfi&s;h motives joined i&s;&s;ue with humani|ty in not only &s;paring, but protecting the vanqui&s;hed. His inva&s;ion was no abrupt incur&s;ion for plunder; and he thought the u&s;ual income of the crown a &s;ufficient reward for his toil. His nobles were gratified with the emoluments of government; and, from di&s;po&s;ition, an enemy to u&s;ele&s;s pomp and grandeur, he cho&s;e that his trea&s;ury &s;hould be gradually filled with the &s;urplus of the revenue, than with the property of individuals, whom the fortune of war had placed beneath his power. Awed by his high character, the companions of his victories carried his mildne&s;s and &s;trict equity through all the de|partments of government. The tyranny of the family of Lodi was forgotten; and the arts, which had been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by a violent de&s;poti&s;m, began to rear their heads, under the temperate dominion of Baber.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humaioon.</NOTE>Humaioon, though not equal in abilities to his father,  carried all his mild virtues into the throne. He was vigi|lant and activein the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, he &s;e|cured property by his edicts; and, an enemy to rapacity him&s;elf, he puni&s;hed the oppre&s;&s;ive avarice of his depu|ties in the provinces. The troubles which di&s;turbed his reign were the effect of the ambition of others; and his expul&s;ion from the throne was le&s;s a misfortune to him than to his &s;ubjects. When he returned with victory, he left the mean pa&s;&s;ion of revenge behind. He puni&s;h|ed not his people for his own di&s;a&s;ters; he &s;eemed to forget the pa&s;t, in the pro&s;pect of doing future good. The nations of India felt, by the benefit received from his pre&s;ence, how much they had lo&s;t by his ab&s;ence. Though worn out under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrants, during his exile, Hindo&s;tan began to revive when he re-mount|ed the throne. His &s;udden and unexpected death por|tended a &s;torm, which was di&s;&s;ipated by the &s;plendid abilities and virtues of his &s;on.</P>

In the more &s;plen|did bu&s;ine&s;s of the field, he forgot not the arts of peace.

He e&s;tabli&s;hed, by edict, the right of the &s;ubject to tran&s;|fer his property without the con&s;ent of the crown, and by ordering a regi&s;ter of the fixed rents of the lands to be kept in the courts of ju&s;tice in every di&s;trict, he took from his officers the power of oppre&s;&s;ing the people. Severe in his ju&s;tice, he never forgave extortion. He promoted ju&s;t complaints again&s;t the &s;ervants of the crown, by various proclamations. He encouraged trade, by an exemption of duties through the interior provinces; and by the invariable protection given to merchants of all nations. He regarded neither the religious opinions nor the countries of men: all who entered his dominions were his &s;ubjects, and they had a right to his ju&s;tice. He i&s;&s;ued an edict which was afterwards revived by Au|rungz&ecirc;be, that the rents &s;hould not be increa&s;ed upon tho&s;e who improved their lands, which wi&s;e regulation encouraged indu&s;try, and became a &s;ource of wealth to the &s;tate.</P>

In his admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, he was &s;crupulous, &s;evere, and exact; and if he

He was minutely acquainted with the &s;tate of the empire, and being free from that caprice and whim which threw a kind of di&s;grace on the authority of his father, he rendered his people happy by the gravity, ju&s;tice, and &s;olemnity of his deci&s;ions. The empire flouri&s;hed under his upright and able admini&s;tration. Oppre&s;&s;ion was unknown from the officers of the crown, on account of the vigilance of the emperor; and the &s;trict impartiality which he e&s;tabli&s;hed in the courts of ju&s;tice, dimini&s;hed injuries between man and man.</P>

He made him|&s;elf minutely acquainted with the revenue paid by eve|ry di&s;trict, with the mode of proceeding in the inferior courts, and even with the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;everal judges. He ordered the regi&s;ter of the rents to be left open for the in&s;pection of all, that the people might di&s;tingui&s;h extortion from the ju&s;t demands of the crown.

He e&s;tabli&s;hed a mode of ap|peal beyond certain &s;ums; and he di&s;graced judges for an error in judgment, and puni&s;hed them &s;everely for corruption and partiality. His activity kept the great machine of government in motion through all its mem|bers: his penetrating eye followed oppre&s;&s;ion to its mo&s;t &s;ecret retreats, and his &s;tern ju&s;tice e&s;tabli&s;hed tranquil|lity, and &s;ecured property over all his exten&s;ive domi|nions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of land|ed</NOTE>When Baber, at the head of his army, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion  of the dominions of the Imperial family of Lodi, he con|tinued to the crown the property of all the lands, The&s;e being annually rented out to the &s;ubject, furni&s;h|ed tho&s;e immen&s;e revenues which &s;upported the une|qualled &s;plendor of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the throne.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">property.</NOTE>The&s;e grants, however, were not always a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the violence of the crown. Some of the  emperors found them&s;elves obliged to re&s;ume many e&s;tates by an edict; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that poli|tical nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;tified the mea&s;ure. Princes who con|tended for the empire were lavi&s;h in their donations; and, had not an act of re&s;umption &s;ometimes taken place, the revenue of the crown would, in proce&s;s of time, have been annihilated. There was, however, a kind of equivalent given to the proprietors; a pen&s;ion was &s;ettled upon them&s;elves, and their children were re|ceived into the &s;ervice of the government. The wealth of the officers of the crown is, after their death, con&s;i|dered as Imperial property; but unle&s;s it is immen&s;e, it is never appropriated by the prince; and even in that ca&s;e a proper provi&s;ion is made for the children, and they have, by an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom, a right to be em|ployed in &s;ome of the departments of the &s;tate.

High birth, however, was re&s;pected; and, to a per&s;on of abilities, it was a great recommendation at the court of princes proud of their own noble origin. The ranks and degrees of nobility were for the mo&s;t part offi|cial, excepting tho&s;e of the military kind. Judges, men of letters, and eminent merchants, have been frequently dignified with titles, and admitted into the circle of the principal nobles in the Imperial pre&s;ence. The nobles con&s;i&s;ted of three orders. The EMIRS, who were the fir&s;t officers of &s;tate, and the viceroys of provinces; the CHANS, who held high po&s;ts in the army; and the BA|HADURS, who may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be compared to our knights. The number of which the&s;e three orders con|&s;i&s;ted was arbitrary, and each of them had peculiar pri|vileges in the empire, and a demand on the re&s;pect of the undignified part of the &s;ubjects.</P>

The provinces were divided into di&s;tricts; in each of which a judge, appointed by the emperor, decid|ed in criminal as well as civil affairs. He pronounced judgment on capital offences, but his &s;entence was never put in execution without the con&s;ent and warrant of the governor of the province. In di&s;putes concerning property, there lay an appeal to the &s;upreme court, in which the viceroy pre&s;ided in per&s;on. Every province was, in miniature, a copy of the empire. Three princi|pal judges, with high titles of dignity, &s;at, with many a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in the capital. They not only decided upon appeals, but &s;uits might originate before them.

He frequently called to this council men in inferior departments; and when the deliberation con|cerned any particular province, the nobles be&s;t acquaint|ed with that part of the empire, were admitted into the cabinet. The offences of the fir&s;t rank of nobility came under the cognizance of this council, as well as other matters of &s;tate. They were a kind of jury, who found the matters of fact, and the &s;overeign pronounced the &s;entence. He might, by his de&s;potic power, i&s;&s;ue out a warrant of death without their advice; but the known opinions of mankind on that &s;ubject bound him like a law.</P>

them from nece&s;&s;ity more than from choice; and the lenity of their admini&s;tration aro&s;e more from the mild|ne&s;s of their di&s;po&s;ition, than from the &s;pirit of their re|gulations. The de&s;potic principles of the Tartars, in|grafted upon the Mahommedan tenets of religion, led to force; and &s;eemed to recognize no obedience but that which proceeded from fear. This circum&s;tance obliged the de&s;pot to inve&s;t his deputies in the provinces with a great part of his power; and when they left his capital, they only did not ab&s;olutely ri&s;e from &s;ubjects into princes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the com|munication</NOTE>This communication of power, though in &s;ome mea|&s;ure  nece&s;&s;ary to command the people, became dangerous to the prince. The Imperial deputies began to lo&s;e their allegiance in proportion to their di&s;tance from the throne. The governors became, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, independent, though they profe&s;&s;ed obedience to the Imperial edicts. A certain portion of the revenue was remitted to court; and the deputy, in a venal court, found frequently means to retain the favour of his prince, when he di&s;obeyed his commands. Every idea of loyalty was, towards the decline of the empire, de&s;troyed among the people of the di&s;tant provinces. They heard of an emperor, as the &s;uper&s;titious hear of a guardian angel, whom they never behold. An indifference for his fate &s;ucceeded to his want of power. A pea&s;ant, at the end of many months, was informed of a revolution

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of power.</NOTE>Notwith&s;tanding this indifference in the inferior &s;ort,  the emperor every day extended &s;ymptoms of his &s;uperior power to the very extremities of his empire. His edicts were tran&s;mitted to every di&s;trict; they were publicly read, and regi&s;tered in the courts of ju&s;tice. They became a &s;ecurity to the people again&s;t the impo&s;itions of the go|vernor. An appeal lay from his deci&s;ions, by a petition to the emperor in the hall of audience. This doctrine was inculcated by the edicts; and &s;ome of the op|pre&s;&s;ed took advantage of the promi&s;e of ju&s;tice which they contained. Their petitions, whenever they found acce&s;s to the throne, were heard with the attention which a jealous prince pays to his own power; and there are many in&s;tances in which the governors of pro|vinces have been &s;everely puni&s;hed for an act of inju&s;tice to a poor pea&s;ant. Never to forgive oppre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the helple&s;s and low, was an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim among all the princes of the hou&s;e of Timur.</P>

Bengal, like many other provinces, &s;tarted up into an independent king|dom, and was governed by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive dyna&s;ties of Rajas, who chiefly re&s;ided at the now de&s;erted capital of Ghor.

Viceroys from Delhi governed the kingdom, from that period, till the debility of Mahommed Shaw gave &s;cope to the u&s;urpation of Aliverdi; and now, by a wonder|ful revolution of &s;ortune, the &s;overeigns of that di&s;tant province are created by the deputies of the Ea&s;t India company.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Bengal.</NOTE>To give an enlarged idea of the &s;ubject, it may not be improper to enquire into the mode of government,  which the Moguls e&s;tabli&s;hed in the important province of Bengal. To impo&s;e nothing merely &s;peculative upon the public, the Writer of the Di&s;&s;ertation has en|deavoured to derive his information from undoubted authority.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of the Moguls.</NOTE>THE Mogul Tartars, when they conquered India, carried a &s;y&s;tem of nece&s;&s;ary policy through the countries which their arms had &s;ubdued. In&s;tead  of &s;eizing the lands of the vanqui&s;hed, they con|firmed them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The number of the conquerors bearing no proportion to the conquered, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation obliged the fir&s;t to adhere together, and to hold the &s;word in their hands. Had they attempted to &s;ettle in different provinces, they would have &s;oon cea&s;ed to be a people; and their power would have been broken by &s;eparation. They retained, therefore, their military character; and, when they reduced a province, they made the taxes paid to former princes, the invariable rule of their impo&s;ts. The people changed their lords, but if their government &s;uffered any change, it was in the &s;ub&s;titution of a milder de&s;poti&s;m, in the place of the fierce tyranny of the Patans.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tributary Rajas.</NOTE>Many of the Rajas, or indigenous Indian princes, had,  from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Mahommedans in India, been permitted to retain a great part of their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which they continued to govern by their own laws, without any appeal from their juri&s;dic|tion
<PB N="xliv" REF="40">
to the courts of ju&s;tice e&s;tabli&s;hed by Imperial commi&s;&s;ions. The only mark of homage paid by the Rajas, was a certain annual tribute. The hou&s;e of Timur, no le&s;s remarkable for their prudence than for their clemency and ju&s;tice, never encroached upon the privileges of the tributary princes. They found, that though the Rajas paid not to the crown above half the &s;um rai&s;ed upon the &s;ubject, their policy, indu&s;try, and good government, were &s;o much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Moguls, that the countries which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, yielded as much in proportion to their ex|tent, as tho&s;e which they had farmed out to Zemin|dars of their own nation and faith. In the two provinces which the Briti&s;h nation now po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which, for the future, we will di&s;tingui&s;h by the general name of Ben|gal, many di&s;tricts of greater extent than any county in Britain, are &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the aboriginal Rajas. But we are more rigid than the Moguls: we have encroached on their privileges, and annihilated their power.

The court of Delhi, under the be&s;t princes, was venal. A &s;um of money, &s;ecretly and properly applied, o&s;ten &s;ecured the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his office to the Zemindar during life; and he even was &s;ometimes enabled to tran&s;mit it to his heirs, till, by length of time, they were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, con&s;idered as lords of their re&s;pective di&s;tricts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their power</NOTE>The farmers, however, had no lea&s;e from the crown of the lands over which they pre&s;ided. Their authority  for collecting the rents from the inferior tenants, was derived from a written agreement, for a certain annual &s;um to be paid to the trea&s;ury, exclu&s;ive of the Imperial taxes. To prevent impo&s;ition on the poorer &s;ort, in every di&s;trict there was e&s;tabli&s;hed a regi&s;ter, in which the rents and impo&s;ts upon every village and farm were entered, and open to the in&s;pection of all. The regi|&s;tered rents and impo&s;ts were collected by the Crorie of the di&s;trict, who was e&s;tabli&s;hed in his office by an Imperial commi&s;&s;ion. He was accountable for the whole, even to the la&s;t D&acirc;m, as the commi&s;&s;ion ex|pre&s;&s;es it, to the Fotad&acirc;r or trea&s;urer of the di&s;trict, who

The&s;e were, from time to time, permitted to rai&s;e the rents upon the inferior tenants, in proportion to the general improvement of the lands. The &s;urplus, which was known to government from the public re|gi&s;ters of the di&s;tricts, was, in part, allowed to the gene|ral &s;armers, for the purpo&s;e of building hou&s;es for the hu&s;bandmen, for furni&s;hing them with implements of agriculture, for embanking to prevent inundations, for making re&s;ervoirs of water for the dry &s;ea&s;on; and, in general, for all expences attending the improvement and cultivation of the lands; which otherwi&s;e would have rendered the accounts of government intricate and perplexed.</P>

In the Imperial officers of the revenue, the poor

had friends, and the Zemindar &s;pies upon his conduct. They were &s;uch checks upon him, that he could con|ceal nothing from their ob&s;ervation. They tran&s;mitted monthly accounts of his tran&s;actions to court. If the tenants were able, without oppre&s;&s;ion, to pay the ad|ditional rent, the demands of the crown ro&s;e at the ex|piration of the year upon the farmer, in proportion to the new impo&s;t; if they were found incapable of bear|ing the burden, the Zemindar was turned out of his office for his avarice and imprudence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A double revenue.</NOTE>A double revenue, it appears from what has been  already ob&s;erved, ro&s;e to the crown from the lands; the ancient rent, e&s;tabli&s;hed at the conque&s;t of India by the Moguls, and the &s;ums which proceeded from the an|nual contracts with the great farmers. The viceroy of the province was ve&s;ted with the power of letting the lands; and he was obliged to tran&s;mit to the receiver-general a record of the &s;ums payable by each Zemindar. The cau&s;e of this mode of rai&s;ing the revenue is ob|vious. The detail of accounts, the making of con|tracts with the inferior tenants, would have rendered the bu&s;ine&s;s of government too minute and too expen|&s;ive; and to have permitted the general farmers to manage their di&s;tricts without either check or controul, would have given birth to &s;cenes of oppre&s;&s;ion,

which Fate had re&s;erved for an unfortunate people, to our times. The Mogul empire is now no more; and the &s;ervants of the free&s;t nation upon earth have left the body of the people to the mercy of the Zemindars.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Various Ze|mindars.</NOTE>The general farmers of di&s;tricts were not the only  per&s;ons known by the name of Zemindars. Men, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e&s;tates for life, and &s;ometimes in perpetuity, free from all taxation, by virtue of Imperial grants, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame title. The&s;e grants were generally given to learned and religious men, to fa|vourite &s;ervants at court, to &s;oldiers who had de&s;erved well of their prince, and they were re&s;pected by &s;ucceed|ing emperors, and &s;eldom revoked. One &s;ixth part of the lands in Bengal had been conferred, in perpetuity, by different princes, on their favourites and adherents. Many of the&s;e e&s;tates have fallen into the Ea&s;t India Company, from a failure of heirs; and others daily fall, as the property is not transferable by &s;ale. A minute enquiry might greatly increa&s;e our revenue. Many grants &s;aid to be derived from the emperor, are only from the governors of the province; many are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of men who cannot trace their blood to the original proprietors.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Different</NOTE>Lands were held by a tenure le&s;s permanent, of the  emperors of Hindo&s;tan. A firm&acirc;n or Imperial man|date, called by the name of Jagieer, was i&s;&s;ued fre|quently to particular men. This &s;pecies of grant was for no term of years. It was given through favour, and revocable at plea&s;ure. When any per&s;on was rai&s;ed to the rank of an Omrah, it was an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule to confer upon him an e&s;tate, for the &s;upport of his dignity. This, however, was nothing more than an a&s;&s;ignment on the revenues of the crown, ari&s;ing from a &s;pecified tract of land in a di&s;trict, named in the body of the grant. The grantee had no bu&s;ine&s;s with the tenants, as he never re&s;ided on the e&s;tate allotted for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He &s;ent his agent every &s;ea&s;on to the public officers of the di&s;trict; and his receipt to them, for his allowance, was received by the Dewan, as a part of the Imperial revenue. No con|ditions of &s;ervice, none for the maintenance of troops, was annexed to this grant. The&s;e are the fables of men who carried the feudal ideas of Europe into their relation of the &s;tate of India. The armies of the em|pire were paid out of the public trea&s;ury.

This &s;pecies of property was repeatedly &s;ecured by ge|neral edicts, for the encouragement of building, for the accommodation of citizens, and the improvement of towns. Grants of this kind did not always proceed from the crown. The governors of provinces were im|powered to i&s;&s;ue Pottas, under certain limitations and re&s;trictions: the principal one of which was, that the u&s;ual rent of the ground &s;hould be paid regularly by the proprietor, to the collectors of the Imperial re|venue.</P>

This regulation was intended to prevent vexatious law-&s;uits, as well as to bring them to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Increa&s;e un|der the em|pire.</NOTE>It appears, from the above calculation, that the reve|nues  of Bengal had been gradually increa&s;ing, in the progre&s;s of the empire, through time. They continued &s;till to increa&s;e, under the revolted Nabobs, &s;ome of whom brought into their trea&s;ury four millions of our money, but not without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject, and plundering him of a part of his wealth. It may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to repeat an ob&s;ervation, already made, that not above half the &s;um rai&s;ed upon the people came into the coffers of government. The exact &s;um tran&s;mitted annually to Delhi, before the di&s;&s;olution of the empire, is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain; but we can form &s;ome judgment of the amount, from the ruinous policy of the Imperial court, when its ancient vigour began to decline. The provinces of Bengal and Beh&acirc;r, during &s;ome years of in|dolence and debility, were farmed out to the viceroys, who paid into the trea&s;ury, one million two hundred and forty-nine thou&s;and nine hundred and ninety-nine pounds &s;eventeen &s;hillings and &s;ixpence of our mo|ney.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sum annual|ly remitted to Delhi.</NOTE>This &s;um, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, was a medium &s;truck, upon  an average of years, of the money remitted to the trea|&s;ury at Delhi, when the empire retained its force. But this &s;tipulated revenue, as might have been fore&s;een, was never regularly paid. The viceroys acquired an inde|pendent
<PB N="lxi" REF="57">
power, by a regulation which threw the whole management of the province into their hands, without controul; and the vigour of the Imperial government, in proportion, declined. The country profited, how|ever, by the refractorine&s;s of its governor; if his avarice prompted him to rai&s;e more on the &s;ubject, the latter was more able than before to pay the additional impo&s;t, from the revenue being kept and expended in the province. Bengal began to flouri&s;h, under an additional load of op|pre&s;&s;ion. It yielded more to a &s;evere Nabob, than to the milder government of the empire; and being relieved from an annual drain of &s;pecie to Delhi, it became opu|lent under a degree of rapine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commerce of</NOTE>Though de&s;poti&s;m is not the mo&s;t favourable govern|ment  for commerce, it flouri&s;hed greatly in Bengal, un|der the &s;trict ju&s;tice of the hou&s;e of Timur. Sen&s;ible of the advantages which they them&s;elves would derive from a free commercial intercour&s;e between their &s;ubjects, they were invariably the protectors of merchants. The mili|tary ideas which they brought from Tartary, prevented the principal &s;ervants of the crown from engaging in trade; and, therefore, monopolies of every kind were di&s;couraged, and almo&s;t unknown. No government in Europe was ever more &s;evere again&s;t fore&s;talling and re|grating,

than was that of the Moguls in India, with regard to all the branches of commerce. A &s;mall duty was rai&s;ed by the crown; but this was amply re|paid, by the never-violated &s;ecurity given to the mer|chant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bengal.</NOTE>Bengal, from the mildne&s;s of its climate, the fertility of its &s;oil, and the natural indu&s;try of the Hindoos, was  always remarkable for its commerce. The ea&s;y com|munication by water from place to place, facilitated a mercantile intercour&s;e among the inhabitants. Every village has its canal, every Pergunna its river, and the whole kingdom the Ganges, which falling, by various mouths, into the bay of Bengal, lays open the ocean for the export of commodities and manufactures. A people, from an inviolable prejudice of religion, ab&s;temious, were aver&s;e to luxury them&s;elves; and the wants of nature were &s;upplied almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly by the &s;oil and climate.

The di&s;tant provinces obeyed the man|dates of the court, through habit, more than through fear of its re&s;entment and power; and governors, though de&s;titute of ambition, found, in their own indolence, an excu&s;e for their inattention to commands which could not be inforced with rigour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the power</NOTE>The intrigues of the two Seids at the court of Delhi,  who rai&s;ed and removed monarchs at plea&s;ure, weakened that re&s;pect for the hou&s;e of Timur which bound the al|legiance of the &s;ubject, even after their mildne&s;s had de|generated into indolence. Every month brought intel|ligence into the di&s;tant provinces of the murder of one prince, whil&s;t another was placed on a throne, &s;till warm with his predece&s;&s;or's blood. The veil which hid de&s;|poti&s;m from the eyes of the people, was rent in twain; monarchs became puppets, which the mini&s;ter moved at plea&s;ure, and even men, who loved &s;lavery on its own account, knew not to what quarter to turn their political devotion. The viceroys, under a pretence of an un&s;et|tled &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, retained the revenues of the provinces; and, with &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty for the Imperial family, they became polite rebels again&s;t its autho|rity.</P>

In&s;tead of a revenue, they remitted to him bribes; and the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation reduced him into a tool, to the very rebels who had ruined his power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Effect of</NOTE>This mock form of an empire continued for many  years; and &s;ome provinces are &s;till governed through the medium of a monarch that only &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in his name. But though the Nabobs affirmed that they had &s;till an emperor, the people found, in their oppre&s;&s;ions, that there was none. The check which the terror of com|plaints to Delhi had laid formerly on the conduct of the viceroys, was now removed; and the officers of the crown who had been placed between the &s;ubject and the governor, were di&s;continued or deprived of their power.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">its di&s;&s;olution</NOTE>The u&s;urpation of Aliverdi introduced, more than  thirty years ago, the above-de&s;cribed form of govern|ment into Bengal. The &s;ame policy was continued by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. They owned the emperor of Delhi for their &s;overeign, but they governed the country, and collected its revenues for them&s;elves. The in|terpo&s;ition of the crown being removed, the indepen|dent Nabobs, who &s;ucceeded one another either by force or intrigue, adopted a more &s;imple, but a more impoli|tic mode of collecting the rents and impo&s;ts, than that which had been practi&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Timur. The lands were let from year to year to Zemindars, who were accountable for the rents to the trea&s;ury, and the former officers of the revenue, though not annihilated, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither emolument nor power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the pro|vince.</NOTE>An intimate knowledge of the country, however, en|abled  the Nabobs to prevent their government from de|generating into ab&s;olute oppre&s;&s;ion. They had &s;en&s;e enough to &s;ee, that their own power depended upon the pro&s;perity of their &s;ubjects; and their re&s;idence in the
<PB N="lxviii" REF="64">
province gave them an opportunity of doing ju&s;tice with more expedition and preci&s;ion than it was done in the times of the empire. The complaints of the injured, from a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means of information, were bet|ter under&s;tood. The Nabobs were le&s;s re&s;tricted than formerly, in inflicting nece&s;&s;ary puni&s;hments; and, as they were accountable to no &s;uperior for the revenue, they had it in their power to remit unju&s;t debts and taxes, which could not be borne. The mi&s;eries of Ben|gal, in &s;hort, were re&s;erved for other times. Commerce, manufactures, and agriculture, were encouraged; for it was not then the maxim to take the honey, by de&s;troy|ing the &s;warm.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Bengal.</NOTE>The folly of the prince had no de&s;tructive effect on  the pro&s;perity of the people. The Nabobs, carrying down, through their own independent government, the idea of the mild de&s;poti&s;m of the hou&s;e of Timur, &s;eem|ed to mark out to the people certain lines, which they them&s;elves did not chu&s;e either to overleap or de&s;troy. Many now in Britain were eye-witne&s;&s;es of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. We appeal to the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who marched through Bengal after the death of Surage-ul-Dowla, that, at that time, it was one of the riche&s;t, mo&s;t populous, and be&s;t cultivated kingdoms in the world. The great men and merchants were wallowing in wealth

and luxury; the inferior tenants and the manufacturers were ble&s;&s;ed with plenty, content, and ea&s;e. But the cloud which has &s;ince ob&s;cured this &s;un&s;hine was near.</P>

A noble governor &s;ent to command in Bengal, by the Ea&s;t India Company, arrived in that kingdom in the May of 1765. The expul&s;ion of the Nabob Ca&s;&s;im Ali, and the reduction of Suja-ul-Dowla, by our arms, had enabled the &s;ervants of the Company to e&s;tabli&s;h peace upon their own terms.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">on the treaty</NOTE>The various revolutions of Fortune, which had &s;ub|jected &s;everal of the riche&s;t provinces of India to the  Company's &s;ervants, threw the undoubted heir of the Mogul empire into their hands.

Other Nabobs had convert|ed the unfortunate prince into a tool; and it was now the turn of our governor to do the &s;ame, for the benefit of his con&s;tituents.

A perpetual commi&s;&s;ion for the office of Dewan, or receiver-general of the revenues of Bengal, Beh&acirc;r, and Ori&s;&s;a was ob|tained, from SHAW ALLUM, for the Company.

The annuity was moderate to the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Timur. He was, at the &s;ame time, guaranteed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the province of Alla|hab&acirc;d; and thus a kind of provi&s;ion was made for a prince, who retained nothing of what belonged to his illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, except the empty title of emperor of Hin|do&s;tan.

Some of the lands in Bengal go under the de&s;ignation of Com&acirc;r, having no native tenants, being cultivated by vagrant hu&s;bandmen, who wander from place to place in que&s;t of labour. A farmer takes frequently large tracts of the&s;e lands upon contract. He obliges him&s;elf to be an&s;werable to go|vernment for the produce; but he keeps the accounts him&s;elf. The vagrant hu&s;bandmen whom he employs, having neither implements of agriculture nor &s;tock, are, from time to time, &s;upplied with &s;mall &s;ums by the farmer, and, when the harve&s;t is gathered in, he appropriates to him&s;elf two thirds of the crop; after paying him&s;elf from the remainder, for the intere&s;t of the &s;ums advanced to the vagrants.

The&s;e rolls, however, are in ge|neral fal&s;e and defective.

Tho&s;e frequent di&s;|putes which grow between individuals, where the acce&s;s to ju&s;tice is ea&s;y, were qua&s;hed by a terror which pre|vented an unfortunate people from appearing before rulers who wanted but an excu&s;e to oppre&s;s. The hand of power fell heavy upon both the plaintiff and defendant; and, therefore, men put up with injuries from one another, in hopes of concealing them&s;elves from the rigid eyes of government.

The peace of the country would be &s;ecured from abroad; and ju&s;tice, by pre|vailing at home, would attach the natives to a govern|ment, on the &s;tability of which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their landed property depended. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a paper currency, on national faith and the Company's &s;ecurity, would enable mankind to bring all their pro|perty into action, lower the exorbitant intere&s;t of money, and render Bengal, in the &s;pace of a few years, the mo&s;t commercial, the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, and the mo&s;t wealthy kingdom, of its extent, in A&s;ia.</P>

the land into their coffers. The improvement of their pre&s;ent revenue would join i&s;&s;ue, with its future certainty and permanency. A large annual &s;um would ari&s;e, from a thorough examination of tenures; and from impo&s;ts already laid upon fairs, markets, entrance into great towns, &s;hops, magazines of grain, fees upon marriages, tolls collected at ferries, licences for exerci&s;ing trades, ground-rent of hou&s;es, which though at pre&s;ent paid by the public, have never been brought to account by Mahommed Riza and the general farmers. The&s;e ar|ticles, at the lowe&s;t average, might amount to the an|nual &s;um of four hundred thou&s;and pounds. Five hundred thou&s;and pounds would yearly be &s;aved in pen&s;ions, and on the charge of collection; be&s;ides, the immen&s;e encrea&s;e in the revenues, which would mo&s;t certainly be derived from the growing pro&s;perity of the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>Concluding Reflections.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;ent</NOTE>ARGUMENTS deduced from general principles,  however obvious they may appear, &s;trike not the bulk of mankind &s;o forcibly as facts. The revenues of Bengal, without including the Jagieers, amounted, in the year 1766, to near three millions and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds of our money. The charges of col|lection, the Nabob's government, pen&s;ions, civil, mili|tary, and marine expences, being deducted, there re|mained a balance of one million three hundred thou|&s;and pounds, for the Company. The expences have &s;ince been encrea&s;ing yearly, and the revenues decrea&s;|ing. Both were ha&s;tening to that middle point, which would balance the accounts of the Briti&s;h nation, with the fortune of their arms in the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ruinous &s;tate</NOTE>To conceal this decrea&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible, men fell on a very &s;hallow and poor expedient. The &s;er|vants  of the Company protracted the time of clo&s;ing
<PB N="cli" REF="149">
the accounts to make up the u&s;ual &s;um; and, by the&s;e means, an encroachment of five months was, by de|grees, made upon the &s;ucceeding year. To under|&s;tand this circum&s;tance, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the collections are not fixed to a particular term. They are continued without intermi&s;&s;ion, and the pro|duce of the five months, which may amount to one million five hundred thou&s;and pounds, mu&s;t be de|ducted from the accounts made up, &s;ince the Dewanny was &s;ubmitted to our management.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the reve|nue.</NOTE>Notwith&s;tanding this deception, it was not the only  deficiency in the &s;tate of money affairs. The reve|nues of the year 1769 had, be&s;ides, fallen &s;hort five hundred thou&s;and pounds; and what further reduction the famine which en&s;ued may have made, time can only demon&s;trate. By the be&s;t accounts from Bengal, there was not a balance of five hundred thou&s;and pounds remaining, after all expences were paid; and this was not above half the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to purcha&s;e the annual inve&s;tments of the Company. No fair conclu&s;ion, however, can be drawn from the produce of one year; and the vigilance of the Court of Directors has &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome beneficial regulations. To flatter the &s;anguine, we will &s;uppo&s;e, that the net balance will amount, on the pre&s;ent &s;ooting, to one million. The
<PB N="clii" REF="150">
&s;um is ju&s;t &s;ufficient for the inve&s;tments of the Com|pany; without leaving a &s;ingle farthing in the trea&s;ury to an&s;wer any extraordinary emergency.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Obvious</NOTE>The advantages of the propo&s;ed plan are obvious;  and, therefore, ea&s;ily explained. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the rent-roll of the year 1766 &s;hall be taken as the rule of the quit-rent to be paid, after the &s;ale of the lands. Let none think this &s;um too much. Under the management of the proprietors, the lands would in a few years produce, thrice the &s;um of three millions &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds; but the &s;ubject mu&s;t receive a bride for his indu&s;try. The Company, at pre&s;ent, complain, that the Talookd&acirc;rs, or tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s lands in property, run away with all the tenants. Their e&s;tates are flouri&s;hing, whil&s;t our limited policy of letting the lands by the year, has created &s;olitudes around. After a thorough examination of fictitious tenures, private encroachments and public embezzlements, we may, with great propriety, venture to add, at lea&s;t one million to the above &s;um. But to &s;peak with a mode|ration which precludes reply, we &s;hall only take it for granted, that four hundred thou&s;and pounds are, by the&s;e means, only gained. Even this &s;um will fix the annual revenue at four millions; and there let it re&s;t till the pro&s;perity of the country &s;hall authori&s;e an encrea&s;e, by &s;light impo&s;ts on trade and the articles of con&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="cliii" REF="151">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advantages</NOTE>The abolition of the tyrannical and impolitic govern|ment  of the Nabob, will be a &s;aving of five hundred thou&s;and pounds on the annual expences. The fact is notorious, that the real expence of this &s;econdary and intermediate government, in pen&s;ions and in the mode of collection, exceeds &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds; but the judicial and fi&s;cal &s;y&s;tems e&s;tabli&s;hed in the preced|ing plan will not exceed one hundred thou&s;and pounds, with all the advantages of a &s;alutary and equitable admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice and law. To this &s;um we may add the five hundred thou&s;and pounds which have fallen off from the revenue, as the fir&s;t-fruits of the plan; all which, &s;uppo&s;ing the expences of the civil, military, and marine departments to remain as at pre&s;ent, would make an annual difference of one million four hundred thou|&s;and pounds, in favour of the Company. The inve&s;t|ments of the Company might in that ca&s;e be increa&s;ed, yet leave a &s;um for the trea&s;ury in Calcutta for emer|gencies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the pro|ceding</NOTE>The trea&s;ury, however, ought not to be too rich, le&s;t  circulation &s;hould deaden in the kingdom. Two mil|lions in &s;pecie would be &s;ufficient. To employ the &s;ur|plus to advantage, together with the ten millions, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the &s;ale of the lands, a bank ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the purpo&s;e of lending out &s;ums of money, not exceeding three years purcha&s;e on landed &s;ecurity to the Proprietors, at the intere&s;t of &s;even per centum. The land-holders would be, by the&s;e
<PB N="cliv" REF="152">
means, enabled to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums, at le&s;s than half the intere&s;t which they now pay; and the Com|pany would have good &s;ecurity for their advances. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that, in the cour&s;e of a few years, ten mil|lions were lent upon the&s;e terms, that &s;um would pro|duce an annual intere&s;t of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds; which, upon the whole plan, makes a yearly balance, in favour of the Company, of TWO MILLIONS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS MORE THAN THEY AT PRESENT RECEIVE, exclu&s;ive of a PRODIGIOUS and GROWING TREASURE; and the moderate impo&s;ts which may be hereafter laid on articles of luxury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan.</NOTE>The Plan, to &s;peak the lea&s;t its favour, is practicable  in its great and general line. It would produce, even partially followed, immen&s;e, &s;udden, and permanent advantages; but no human fore&s;ight can ab&s;olutely e&s;timate the preci&s;e &s;ums. Though the Author of the Enquiry has not the vanity to &s;uppo&s;e that his &s;cheme is, in all its branches, infallible, he will venture to pledge him&s;elf to his country, that, &s;hould the more material parts of his &s;y&s;tem be adopted, the advantages to be derived from it would not fall &s;hort of his calculations. His know|ledge of the kingdom of Bengal, and its various re|&s;ources, gives him a confidence on this &s;ubject, to which he is not intitled by his abilities.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><MILESTONE N="1605" UNIT="A.D."><MILESTONE N="1014" UNIT="Higer."><NOTE PLACE="marg">General</NOTE>THE great abilities of Akbar confirmed the hou&s;e of Timur on the throne, and e&s;tabli&s;hed tranquillity over all their va&s;t conque&s;ts in India. Vigorous in his mea&s;ures, with|out  tyranny, he impre&s;&s;ed the minds of men with awe, and checked that &s;pirit of di&s;cord and private ambition, which had pre|vailed in more feeble reigns. Government becoming &s;ettled and uniform in its regulations, the arts of civil life began to increa&s;e and flouri&s;h, among a people naturally indu&s;trious and ingenious. The &s;plendor of the court, the wealth of individuals, created a
<PB N="2" REF="163">
general ta&s;te for pomp and magnificence; and the crowded levees of the great, where all endeavoured to excel in the art of plea&s;ing, rendered the Indians equal in politene&s;s to the nations of Europe. Learning was not unknown, if we exclude the ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ciences. The Arabian and Brahmin &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy were &s;tudied; and the powers of the mind were generally cultivated and improved.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">ob&s;erva|tions.</NOTE>This character of civilization, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, tallies not  with the political conduct of the people. But nece&s;&s;ity and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation make a kind of apology for crimes under de&s;poti&s;m, which would be unpardonable in a community governed by general and known laws. In &s;tates &s;ubject to arbitrary government, there is no &s;ecurity, no honour, no independence in private life. The nation is divided into two &s;orts of people, the oppre&s;&s;ors and the oppre&s;&s;ed. Every man of &s;pirit, of family, and of fortune, mu&s;t, in &s;elf-defence, endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;hare of the government under which he was born. When he &s;tarts forth from ob&s;curity, he mu&s;t adopt the political principles of his country, or be ruined in all his &s;chemes, however repugnant the&s;e principles may be to the general dictates of humanity, and the particular di&s;po&s;ition of his own mind. The greate&s;t virtues therefore are often blended with the wor&s;t vices; and this circum&s;tance gives a variety and &s;trength of feature to A&s;iatic characters, unknown in the &s;ettled governments of the we&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Extent and revenues of the empire.</NOTE>Though the empire of the Mahommedans in India was  not &s;o exten&s;ive under Akbar as it had been under &s;ome princes of the Patan Dyna&s;ty, it comprehended a va&s;t tract of country, divided into twenty-two provinces; each equal to &s;ome kingdoms in wealth, fertility and extent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kandahar, Ghizni, Cabal, Ca&s;hmire, Lahore, Moultain, Outch, Sindi, Ajmere, Sirhind, Delhi, Du&acirc;b, Agra, Allahabad, Oud, Beh&acirc;r, Bengal, Ori&s;&s;a, Malava, Ber&acirc;r, Chandei&s;h, Guzerat.</NOTE>. A &s;mall part only of the Decan or &s;ourthern penin&s;ula of India had been con|quered:
<PB N="3" REF="164">
yet the dominions of the family of Timur, in their northern and &s;outhern frontiers, fell under the thirty-&s;ixth and ninetenth parallels of latitude; and they extended them&s;elves, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, about twenty-five degrees. The revenues, according to the Imperial regi&s;ter, were thirty-two millions &s;ter|ling, received in the exchequer, exclu&s;ive of the cu&s;tomary pre&s;ents, and the e&s;tates of the officers of the crown, which at their death reverted to the emperor, and amounted, at a medi&ugrave;m, to twenty millions more of our money. The&s;e immen&s;e &s;ums were expended in maintaining an army of three hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e, as many of foot, in &s;upport of the &s;plendor of the court, and in the &s;alaries of civil officers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues a|gain&s;t Sultan Selim.</NOTE>When the indi&s;po&s;ition of the emperor Akbar rendered him  incapable of attending to public bu&s;ine&s;s, the whole weight of government fell on Chan Azim, the Vi&s;ier. Selim, Akbar's only &s;urviving &s;on, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;putes which he had formerly with his father, was &s;till looked upon as the heir of the empire. But the Vi&s;ier's daughter being married to Chu&s;ero, the elde&s;t &s;on of Selim, that mini&s;ter was de&s;irous of placing the reins of government in the hands of his &s;on-in-law. He was &s;upported in this &s;cheme by many of the nobles; the mo&s;t enterprizing and powerful of whom was Raja Man Singh, who&s;e &s;i&s;ter was the mother of Chu&s;ero. The Raja, from the antiquity of his family, and his own addre&s;s, commanded all the Hindoo intere&s;t in the empire; and he had, at that very time, twenty thou&s;and of his native &s;ubjects of the Rajaput tribe in and near the environs of the capital, prepared to execute his orders. Selim being apprized of the powerful confederacy again&s;t him, waited upon his father Akbar, two days before his death, and laid before him all their &s;chemes. The emperor called them to his pre&s;ence, reprimanded them &s;everely; and having publicly acknowledged Selim his law|ful
<PB N="4" REF="165">
&s;ucce&s;&s;or in the empire, obliged the confederate lords to pay him homage, and to promi&s;e to &s;upport his title.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</NOTE>On the &s;ixteenth of the &s;econd Jemm&acirc;d, in the year of the Higera  one thou&s;and and fourteen, the illu&s;trious Akbar expired at Agra, amid the tears of his &s;ubjects; who loved him as their father, admired him as their leader, and feared him as their prince. The promi&s;e extorted by the emperor from the Vi&s;ier and Man Singh in favour of Selim, had no effect on their conduct. He was no &s;ooner dead than they a&s;&s;embled their party in the hou&s;e of the former, and renewed their deliberations in favour of Chu&s;ero, in prejudice of his father. Selim in the mean time was not idle. He convened all his friends in his own palace. Things remained in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for &s;ome hours. Ferid Bochari, who commanded the city-guards, took at length a &s;pirited re&s;olution. He ordered the gates to be &s;hut, to prevent any troops from entering the city; and, taking the keys in his hand, ha&s;tened to the palace of Selim. He pre&s;ented them on his knees, and &s;aluted him emperor. All pre&s;ent followed his example. The news &s;oon reached the hou&s;e of the Vi&s;ier. The party of Chu&s;ero was &s;truck with a &s;udden panic. They broke up from council, and made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to pay their re&s;pects to the new &s;overeign. The Vi&s;ier took care not to be the la&s;t. The hopes of Chu&s;ero were da&s;hed in a mo|ment. He was &s;eized with fear, and fled down the river in a &s;mall canoe, with Raja Man Singh, and concealed him&s;elf in that prince's hou&s;e till he obtained a pardon from his father. Ferid, for this &s;ignal &s;ervice, was advanced to the rank of payma&s;ter-general of the forces, by the title of Murtaza Chan; and many other di&s;tin|gui&s;hing honours were at the &s;ame time conferred upon him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His titles and age.</NOTE>Selim was born at Sikri, near Agra, on Wedne&s;day the &s;even|teenth  of the &s;econd Ribbi, in the nine hundredth and &s;eventy-&s;eventh
<PB N="5" REF="166">
year of the Higera. The mo&s;t remarkable event of Selim's life, before his acce&s;&s;ion, was, his di&s;obedience to his father's orders, rather than his rebellion again&s;t him, about two years prior to that monarch's death. In&s;olent at fir&s;t, he refu&s;ed to return to his duty, and was once actually at the head of &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Upon the death of the prince Dani&acirc;l, he, however, &s;ubmitted, having then a nearer pro&s;pect of the throne; Akbar having upbraided him for his di&s;obedience at fir&s;t, and his pu&s;illanimity afterwards, for throwing him&s;elf upon an enraged &s;overeign's mercy, when he was at the head of a great army, received him into favour. When Selim took the reins of government in his hands, he a&s;&s;umed the titles of Noor-ul-dien Mahommed JEHANGIRE, or Mahommed the Light of the Faith and CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD. He dated the commencement of his reign from the twentieth of the &s;econd Jemm&acirc;d 1014, which an&s;wers to the 21&s;t of October 1605, being then in the thirty-&s;eventh year of his age. Akbar was interred with great pomp at Secundra, near Agra; and the minds of men were di&s;tracted between grief and joy, funeral &s;olemnity, and the fe&s;tivity attending upon the acce&s;&s;ion of a new &s;overeign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His prudent and wi&s;e admini&s;tra|tion.</NOTE>Chan Azim, the di&s;contented Vi&s;ier, and the Raja Man Singh,  were &s;o formidable in the empire, that Jehangire thought it mo&s;t prudent to accept of the offered allegiance of both, and to con|firm them in their re&s;pective honours and governments, without animadver&s;ion upon their late conduct. Man Singh was di&s;patched to his &s;uba&s;hip of Bengal; Chan Azim to that of Malava. The prince Chu&s;ero made his appearance at court; and his father, after a &s;evere reprimand, took him at la&s;t into favour. The emperor in the mean time began his reign by a &s;trict admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice, and by a minute in&s;pection into the finances and re&s;ources of the &s;tate. He i&s;&s;ued a public edict to confirm all the
<PB N="6" REF="167">
laws and regulations in force. Many &s;ubas were removed from their re&s;pective governments into other provinces: &s;ome were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to make room for the emperor's abettors and friends. The deprived governors repaired to court to re&s;tore them&s;elves, by money and intrigue, to their former dignities. Some &s;ucceeded in their views: others were reduced to de&s;pair, through want of &s;uc|ce&s;s. The latter began to form trea&s;onable de&s;igns to recover the con&s;equence and power which they had lo&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A con&s;piracy in favour of his &s;on Chu|&s;ero;</NOTE>To accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e, the di&s;contented lords turned their eyes upon Chu&s;ero, and hoped, by his means, to effect a revolu|tion  in the &s;tate. They pretended to have the greate&s;t attachment to his per&s;on: they magnified the number of his friends, and his own merit. They rouzed his ambition by the prai&s;e of pa&s;t actions, and animated it by the fair pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s. But what had mo&s;t weight with the prince, they intimidated him with pretended di&s;coveries of the de&s;igns of his father again&s;t his life. The &s;ecrecy nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in all arduous under|takings again&s;t de&s;potic governments, rendered it difficult for Chu&s;ero to know the true &s;tate of things. The &s;pies, whom the emperor had placed around him, in the mean time, increa&s;ed, and confirmed his fears. Ambition, aided by timidity, at length pre|vailed over filial duty. He plunged therefore into danger, to take immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a throne, which he was born one day to mount, without the doubtful fortune of the &s;word.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who rejects a propo&s;al of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</NOTE>Chan Azim, and the Raja Man Singh, had the addre&s;s not to  appear openly in the con&s;piracy. They were, however, known to be the life and &s;upport of the whole. They were &s;till under the cloud of the emperor's di&s;plea&s;ure, which, at a convenient &s;ea&s;on, might bur&s;t on their heads. The prince being &s;o far involved in the plot, it would be dangerous for him to recede: and they,
<PB N="7" REF="168">
<MILESTONE N="1606" UNIT="A.D."><MILESTONE N="1015" UNIT="Hig.">
ju&s;tly con&s;idering the improbability of &s;ucce&s;s by open force again&s;t the Imperial power, propo&s;ed the more &s;peedy expedient of a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inating Jehangire. The propo&s;al came to the ears of the prince. Though he was bent upon rebellion, he &s;tartled at parricide. Na|ture was rouzed in his brea&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"My father," &s;aid he, "may enjoy life without a throne; but I can never enjoy a throne &s;tained with a father's blood. Let him try the fortune of the field. Let us throw away the daggers of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and owe our advancement to our &s;words."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The plot di&s;|covered.</NOTE>The con&s;pirators pretended to applaud the noble &s;entiments of the  prince: but they, from that in&s;tant, were irre&s;olute and embarra&s;&s;ed in their councils. Many, violent at the beginning, now awed by the greatne&s;s of the undertaking, &s;hrunk back from their purpo&s;e, and began to &s;helter them&s;elves behind one another. The empe|ror, in the mean time, was in part informed of the plot. He pre|pared to &s;eize the prince: the latter was apprized of his father's de&s;igns. By a premature di&s;covery, this con&s;piracy, like many of the &s;ame kind, failed. Fear took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the adherents of Chu&s;ero. He him&s;elf was afraid. They neglected to execute the daring &s;troke, which their &s;ituation and &s;afety required. They began to remove them&s;elves from immediate danger, as if the pre|&s;ent were more to be feared than tho&s;e which in future they had to oppo&s;e. They, however, did not altogether relinqui&s;h their de&s;igns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t ri&s;ing.</NOTE>On Monday the eight of Zehidge, &s;ix months after the acce&s;|&s;ion  of Jehangire to the throne of India, near one hundred of the con&s;pirators a&s;&s;embled privately, in the evening, at the tomb of the emperor Akbar. Chu&s;ero having joined them, on pretence of pay|ing his devotions at his grandfather's &s;hrine, they proceeded, that very night, toward Delhi. About day-break, next morning, they had reached the city of Muttra, about thirty-eight miles from
<PB N="8" REF="169">
Agra; and entered the town, when the troops, who garri&s;oned the place, were on the parade. They halted for refre&s;hment; and they had the good fortune not to be &s;u&s;pected by the officer who commanded at Muttra. Hu&s;&s;ein Beg Chan Buduch&s;hi, who had been governor of the province of Cabul during a con&s;iderable part of the former reign, being turned out of his office by the emperor, was on his way to court. Having travelled in the night on account of the heat of the weather, he happened to enter the city of Muttra at the oppo&s;ite gate ju&s;t when the prince arrived. They met in the market-place. Chu&s;ero was no &s;tranger to the di&s;con|tent of Hu&s;&s;ein; and e&s;teeming him a great acqui&s;ition to his party, from his known bravery and popularity among the Tartars, who formed a great part of the imperial army, he called him a&s;ide, and having &s;ounded him, laid open his whole plan. Hu&s;&s;ein being con&s;cious of no crime again&s;t the &s;tate, thought him&s;elf highly injured by Jehangire. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no property but the &s;word, from the genero&s;ity of his di&s;po&s;ition, which had lavi&s;hed his fortune upon his friends, he required not much intreaty to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chu&s;ero marches to Delhi.</NOTE>The retinue of Hu&s;&s;ein was but &s;mall. It con&s;i&s;ted of two hun|dred  Tartar hor&s;e, and three hundred Afgan foot. But his military fame was great; and he gave life to the con&s;piracy. The prince endeavoured to bring over the governor of Muttra to his party. That officer, perceiving his intentions, &s;hut him&s;elf up in the citadel, and would li&s;ten to no terms. Chu&s;ero had neither time nor force to reduce him. He contented him&s;elf with enli&s;ting as many as he could of the inhabitants and garri&s;on into his &s;ervice; and, leaving Muttra, continued his route to Delhi.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ravages the country.</NOTE>The road between the two great cities of Delhi and Agra being  crowded with travellers, and detachments of hor&s;e and foot going

on different &s;ervices, the prince forced them to join his &s;tandard. Tho&s;e who refu&s;ed were, without mercy, put to the &s;word, after being plundered of all their effects. Small parties of hor&s;e were at the &s;ame time di&s;per&s;ed through the country on every &s;ide; and &s;uch as did not immediately take up arms in favour of Chu&s;ero were &s;ubmitted to military execution, and all the &s;everities of war. Many were compelled to join him, through fear. Others, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, fled into the woods; and &s;aw from their retreats the &s;moke of their burning hou&s;es, and mourned over their infants and aged parents, who had not &s;trength to avoid the flames. Some more re&s;olute defended them&s;elves again&s;t the rebels, and to their valour owed their lives. The orders of the prince, it mu&s;t be owned, did not extend to &s;uch rigour and cruelty. But he found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train from exce&s;&s;es his undi&s;ciplined &s;oldiers. He had &s;et them an example of wickedne&s;s by rebellion; and it was not to be expected that they would &s;ubmit to his commands in favour of humanity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lays the &s;ub|urbs of Del|hi under con|tributions.</NOTE>Such was the wa&s;teful progre&s;s of Chu&s;ero to Delhi. His fol|lowers  having greatly increa&s;ed their numbers in the march, he laid the &s;uburbs of that capital under contribution. The gates being &s;hut, the city it&s;elf was pre&s;erved from pillage. The unfor|tunate people who lived without the walls, from their delay in rai&s;ing the &s;um impo&s;ed upon them, had their hou&s;es con&s;umed with fire. Many thou&s;ands were ruined. Many, to retrieve their affairs, joined the rebels, to make repri&s;als upon the world for the lo&s;s which they had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor pur&s;ues Chu|&s;ero,</NOTE>At eleven o'clock of the &s;ame night on which Chu&s;ero left Agra,  his father was informed of his flight by the captain-general, who was ordered to pur&s;ue immediately the fugitive. About an hour
<PB N="10" REF="171">
after this officer's departure with a con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e, the emperor, &s;u&s;pecting his loyalty, di&s;patched his commands to him to return. Ferid Bochari, lately rai&s;ed to the dignity of Murtaza Chan, and to the office of payma&s;ter-general of the forces, was di&s;patched upon that &s;ervice, with an additional number of troops. The whole under Ferid amounted to ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, which greatly retarded his march. Chu&s;ero, of cour&s;e, had the more time to hara&s;s the country, and to &s;trengthen him&s;elf. In the morn|ing, as &s;oon as day-light appeared, the emperor mounted his hor&s;e; and having a&s;&s;embled all the forces in and near Agra, leaving a &s;ufficient garri&s;on in the place, marched with a great army toward Delhi. He was, upon the occa&s;ion, heard to repeat a ver&s;e, which implied, <Q REND="inline">"That fortune depended upon expedition more than on coun&s;el; and that his life &s;hould be darkened who put off till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day."</Q> The undu|tiful behaviour of a &s;on, whom he loved, was a &s;evere &s;troke to his mind. He refu&s;ed to eat or drink, or to take re&s;t for &s;ome time; and even opium, to which he was much addicted, he declined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who takes the route of Lahore.</NOTE>The governor and inhabitants of Delhi, having recovered from  the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions which the &s;udden arrival and ravages com|mitted by Chu&s;ero had made upon their minds, prepared for a re&s;olute defence. Some troops, who were &s;tationed in different parts of the country, had thrown them&s;elves into the town. As there was a con&s;iderable quantity of the Imperial trea&s;ure lodged in the city, as well as the great wealth of private per&s;ons, the inten|tions of the prince were to have &s;urprized Delhi, and to furni&s;h him&s;elf with money &s;ufficient to rai&s;e an army in the province of Punjab. But the general terror which his rapacity had excited carried the news of his march before him, and di&s;appointed his de&s;igns. De&s;pairing of being able to force Delhi to &s;urrender
<PB N="11" REF="172">
before the arrival of the Imperial army, having remained only two days in the &s;uburbs, Chu&s;ero took the route of Lahore. Having been, on his march, joined by a great number of men, he attempted, immediately upon his arrival, to take that city by e&s;calade. He was repul&s;ed with &s;ome lo&s;s by the garri&s;on; and being at the &s;ame time de&s;titute of artillery, he was greatly di&s;concerted in his mea|&s;ures. He, however, inve&s;ted the place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is de&s;eat|ed by Ferid Bochari.</NOTE>The Imperial troops &s;tationed in the province threw them&s;elves  into Lahore. They &s;allied out on the be&s;iegers nine &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, but they were as often repul&s;ed, and obliged to &s;helter them|&s;elves behind their walls. Chu&s;ero in the mean time had drawn together &s;ome artillery from &s;mall fortre&s;&s;es in the neighbourhood, which he had found means to &s;urpri&s;e. Nothing could be effected again&s;t the place before the arrival of Ferid, the payma&s;ter-general, with the emperor's advanced guard. The prince, with an army of thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, but without order, without di&s;|cipline, marched out of his camp to give battle to Ferid.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is called to court.</NOTE>Jehangire kept his court at Delhi, when he called Shere Afkun  to the pre&s;ence. He received him graciou&s;ly, and conferred new honours upon him. Shere Afkun, naturally open and generous, &s;u&s;pected not the emperor's intentions. Time, he thought, had crazed the memory of Mher-ul-Ni&s;&s;a from Jehangire's mind. He was deceived. The monarch was re&s;olved to remove his rival; but the means he u&s;ed were, at once, fooli&s;h and di&s;grace|ful. He appointed a day for hunting; and ordered the haunt of an enormous tiger to be explored.

Jehangire had meanly conde&s;cended to give private orders to the rider of one of his large&s;t elephants to waylay his rival, in one of the narrow &s;treets, when he next &s;hould return to court, and there to tread him to death. As accidents of that kind &s;ometimes happen, from the rage of tho&s;e animals in the rutting &s;ea&s;on, the thing might have pa&s;&s;ed without &s;u&s;picion. Shere was carried in his palanky.

The former de&s;igns of Jehangire were no &s;ecret. They were the &s;ubject of common conver&s;ation, little to the advantage of the character of a great prince. Ab&s;olute monarchs, however, are never without men who flatter their wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, and ad|mini&s;ter to their mo&s;t pernicious plea&s;ures. Kuttub, Suba of Bengal, was one of the&s;e convenient &s;ycophants. To ingratiate him&s;elf with the emperor, though perhaps not by his expre&s;s commands, he hired forty ru&s;&s;ians, to attack and murder Shere, when an opportunity &s;hould offer. Shere was apprized of the intentions of Kuttub. He continued within doors: but &s;uch was his confidence in his own &s;trength and valour, that at night he would not permit his &s;ervants to remain in his hou&s;e. They, according to cu&s;tom, retired each to his own home. An old porter only remained of the men &s;ervants, under the &s;ame roof with Shere.

This room communicated, by a narrow pa&s;&s;age, with the &s;leeping apart|ments.

Scarce one half e&s;caped without a wound. The old man, who had given warning, did not attempt to fly. Shere took him by the hand, prai&s;ed and thanked him for his behaviour, and, having enquired about tho&s;e who had hired the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, with hand&s;ome pre&s;ents, to relate the particulars abroad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is mur|dered.</NOTE>The fame of this gallant exploit re&s;ounded through the whole  empire. Shere could not &s;tir abroad for the mob, who pre&s;&s;ed around him. He, however, thought proper to retire from the capital of Bengal, to his old re&s;idence at Burdwan. He hoped to live there in ob&s;curity and &s;afety, with his beloved Mher-ul-Ni&s;&s;a. He was deceived. The Suba of Bengal had received his government, for the purpo&s;e of removing the unfortunate Shere; and he was not ungrateful. After deliberating with him&s;elf about the means, he, at la&s;t, fell upon an effectual expedient. Settling the a&s;&s;airs of his government at Tanda, which was, at that time, the capital of Bengal, he re&s;olved, with a great retinue, to make the tour of the dependent provinces. In his rout he came to Burdwan. He made no &s;ecret to his principal o&s;&s;icers, that he had the emperor's orders for di&s;patching Shere. That devoted Omrah, hearing that the Suba was entering the town in which he re&s;ided, mounted his hor&s;e, and, with two &s;ervants only, went to pay his re&s;pects. The Suba received Shere with a&s;&s;ected
<PB N="29" REF="190">
politene&s;s. They rode, for &s;ome time, &s;ide by &s;ide; and their conver&s;ation turned upon indifferent a&s;&s;airs. The Suba &s;ud|denly &s;topt.

Shere &s;tood &s;till, when the Suba was a&s;cending; and one of the pikemen, pretending that Shere was in the way, &s;truck his hor&s;e, and began to drive him before him. Shere was enraged at the affront. He knew that the pikeman dur&s;t not have u&s;ed that freedom without his ma&s;ter's orders: he &s;aw plainly, that there was a laid de&s;ign again&s;t his life. He turned round upon the pikeman; and threatened him with in&s;tant death. He fell on the ground and begged for mercy. Swords were drawn. Shere had no time to lo&s;e. He &s;purred his hor&s;e up to the elephant, on which the Suba was mounted; and having broke down the amari or ca&s;tle, cut him in two; and thus the unfortunate Kuttub became the victim of his own zeal to plea&s;e the emperor. Shere did not re&s;t here: he turned his &s;word on the other officers. The fir&s;t that fell by his hands, was Aba Chan, a native of Ca&s;hmire; who was an Omrah of five thou&s;and hor&s;e. Four other nobles &s;hared the &s;ame fate. A death attended every blow from the hand of Shere. The remaining chiefs were at once a&s;toni&s;hed and frightened. They &s;led to a di&s;tance, and formed a circle around him. Some began to gall him with arrows; others to &s;ire with their mu&s;quets. His hor&s;e, at length, being &s;hot with a ball in the forehead, fell under him. The unfortunate Shere, reduced to the la&s;t extremity, began to upbraid them with cowardice. He invited them &s;eve|rally to &s;ingle combat; but he begged in vain. He had already received &s;ome wounds. He plainly &s;aw his approaching fate. Turning his &s;ace toward Mecca, he took up &s;ome du&s;t with his hand; and, for want of water, threw it, by way of ablution, upon his head. He then &s;tood up, &s;eemingly unconcerned. Six balls

An ample field was left for the virtues and abilities of the new vi&s;ier; who turned his attention more to dome&s;tic improvement than to foreign conque&s;t. Agriculture, which had been much neglected, was encouraged. Many provinces, de&s;olated by former di&s;turbances and wars, were, by degrees, repeopled and cultivated. Security of property was given to the farmer; the indu&s;try of the mechanic was protected. The country a&s;&s;umed a new face: the u&s;eful arts were revived and flouri&s;hed in the cities. The vi&s;ier even extended his improvements to de&s;arts. Fore&s;ts, formerly the haunts of wild bea&s;ts, were cut down; and villages and towns

The revenues of the empire gradually increa&s;ed: to prevent extortion in the collec|tion, every Suba was obliged to tran&s;mit monthly to court, a &s;tate of the improvements and regulations made, in con&s;equence of public in&s;tructions from Agra. When the improvements were not adequate to the taxes, the Subas were either &s;everely repri|manded, or degraded. No di&s;tinctions were made, in the admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, between the Mahommedan and Hindoo.

The&s;e barbarians were encouraged to in&s;urrection, by the ab&s;ence of Shaw Bcc Chan, Suba of Cabul, from the capital of the pro|vince of that name.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An in &s;urrec|tion in Ben|gal.</NOTE>An in&s;urrection happened in Bengal toward the clo&s;e of the  &s;ame year. A&s;man, an Afgan, de&s;cended of the race of the Patan princes, who reigned in India before the empire fell under the dominion of the hou&s;e of Timur, &s;tirred up a rebellion. He had formerly made many attempts to recover the throne of his fathers; but this was his mo&s;t formidable and re&s;olute effort. Sujait, an officer of rank, was di&s;patched again&s;t the rebel by I&s;lam Chan, Suba of Bengal. Both armies &s;oon came to an action. Sujait was on the point of being defeated. He drove his elephant, as the la&s;t re&s;ort of de&s;pair, through the thicke&s;t of the enemy, in &s;earch of A&s;man, who was mounted on a hor&s;e. The elephant having &s;eized the hor&s;e, da&s;hed him and his rider again&s;t the ground; but when the animal was about to tread the unfortunate A&s;man under his feet, one of his attendants came and wounded the elephant in the trunk. The elephant, with the pain of the wound, plunged in &s;uch a manner, that Sujait was thrown off, and fell headlong on the ground. His life was &s;aved by his men; who &s;eeing him expo&s;ing his per&s;on, became le&s;s careful about their own. In their effort to extricate their chief, they repul&s;ed the enemy. A&s;man, brui&s;ed with his fall, was carried back to his tent, where he &s;oon after expired. His death gave the victory to Sujait, and qua&s;hed the rebellion in Bengal.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another in Beh&acirc;r.</NOTE>The in&s;urrection in Bengal was &s;carce quelled, when another  of a more extraordinary nature happened in the neighbouring province of Beh&acirc;r. A man of low degree, who&s;e name was
<PB N="38" REF="199">
Cuttub, de&s;cended of the Rohilla tribe of Afgans, and a native of Atcha, found his way to Beh&acirc;r. That province was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a number of his nation, who had &s;ettled there under the Patan em|pire. He affirmed that he was the prince Chu&s;ero, the reigning emperor's &s;on; and he accompanied his impo&s;ture with a probable &s;tory of his e&s;cape from pri&s;on. The misfortunes of Chu&s;ero had rendered him popular. Many believed the tale. Many, in love with innovation and &s;poil, joined the &s;tandard of Cuttub. He numbered, in le&s;s than a week, &s;even thou&s;and among his fol|lowers. He a&s;&s;umed immediately the Imperial titles, and ad|vanced, with his motley army of banditti, toward Patna, the capital of the province of Beh&acirc;r. A&s;&s;il Chan, the Suba of the province, was ab&s;ent at Gazipoor, about one hundred and twenty miles from Patna; and his deputy commanded in the city, when Cuttub appeared before it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qua&s;hed.</NOTE>The city of Patna was too large and ill-garri&s;oned with troops  to make any defence. Cuttub entered it, with little oppo&s;ition. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the palace, women, and wealth of the Suba; and, giving up Patna to plunder, divided the &s;poil among his adherents. Some, who were no &s;trangers to the per&s;on of Sultan Chu&s;ero, endeavoured to expo&s;e the impo&s;ture. They &s;uffered for their ra&s;hne&s;s, and were put to death. Some, con&s;cious of the impo&s;ition, were afraid to own their folly; and, having gone &s;o far, were unwilling and a&s;hamed to recede. A&s;&s;il him&s;elf, at fir&s;t, gave &s;ome credit to a report brought from all quarters. He knew not how to behave. He affected the party of Chu&s;ero; and he feared the emperor. Ten days after Patna was &s;urprized by Cuttub, A&s;&s;il was convinced, by various letters, that the leader of the in&s;urrection was not the prince. He ha&s;tened from Gazi|poor, with all the forces he could collect. On the third day he

pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Patna. Cuttub marched out and gave him battle. The in&s;urgents were defeated and fled. In the hurry of their flight they neglected to &s;hut the gates; and the enemy entered at their heels. The pretended prince, driven to the la&s;t extremity, &s;hut him&s;elf up, with a few friends, in the Suba's hou&s;e. He defended him&s;elf for &s;ome time. A&s;&s;il, having lo&s;t twenty men in endeavouring to &s;cale the walls, was &s;o fortu|nate as to kill the impo&s;tor with a brick-bat; and thus a ridicu|lous kind of death put an end to the ambitious views of Cuttub.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Pur|vez &s;ent a|gain&s;t the Rana.</NOTE>Intelligence of this in&s;urrection arrived at the court of Agra,  at the &s;ame time with the news of its being quelled. Fre&s;h di&s;turbances broke out in a different corner of the empire. Amar Sinka, prince of Odipour, in the Decan, &s;etting &s;uddenly upon the Imperial troops on the frontier, defeated them. The action hap|pened near the city of Brampour, among the mountains of Bala|gat. The emperor was alarmed. He placed his &s;econd &s;on, Purvez, at the head of thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e; and gave him, at the &s;ame time, a commi&s;&s;ion to take the command of all the troops on the confines of the Imperial dominions and the Decan. The force, had it even been well conducted, was no more than adequate to the &s;ervice. Amar Sinka, who went under the title of Rana, or THE PRINCE, by way of eminence, deduced his de&s;cent from the Imperial family, who reigned in the great city of Kin&ocirc;ge over all India for many centuries, before that empire was invaded by the followers of Mahommed. He added power to his noble birth. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greater part of the territories which compo&s;e the exten&s;ive dominions of the pre&s;ent Mahrat|tors; and the lawful heir of his family bears, to this day, the name of Prince among that powerful ari&s;tocracy.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feuds in the Imperial ar|my.</NOTE>Many nobles of the fir&s;t rank and renown attended Sultan Purvez in this expedition. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable were Chan Jehan, de&s;cended of the Imperial family of Lodi, who reigned  before the hou&s;e of Timur, in Hindo&s;tan; Mirza Abdul Rahim, who derived his pedigree from Timur; and Chan Chanan, the &s;on of the famous Byram, who had been regent during the mino|rity of the emperor Akbar. The&s;e compo&s;ed the prince's coun|cil. But they carried their former feuds into their deliberations. They were unanimous in nothing. Jealou&s;y, in its mo&s;t forbid|ding form, appeared in all their debates; and they could not even ab&s;tain from indecent reflections upon one another. The &s;pirit of di&s;cord &s;pread from the council of war to the army. Each of the great Omrahs had his partizans and abettors. Faction and tumult reigned in every corner of the camp. The prince was naturally mild; he wanted experience; and he was de&s;titute of that intrepid firmne&s;s and &s;everity, which is nece&s;&s;ary to awe mankind into obedience. He de&s;cended to intreaty where he ought to command; and when he endeavoured to reconcile them, their pa&s;&s;ion became more inflamed, as every check was removed by his known &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their di&s;tre&s;s and retreat.</NOTE>The army in the mean time advanced. Within a few days march of Brampour, the Imperiali&s;ts came in &s;ight of the enemy.

Chan Jehan was for battle. Chan Chanan differed from him in opinion; as the enemy was too advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted in the hills. Abdul Rahim, was for entering the Rana's country by another road. The prince was ready to adopt any re&s;olution, upon which they all &s;hould agree. This was impo&s;&s;ible. The

army lay inactive. The air in the camp became putrid. Fevers raged. The enemy hovered round on the mountains. Provi&s;ions and forage became &s;carce: the fields around were red with the fre&s;h graves of the dead. But though the council of war di&s;a|greed about an attack, they concurred in a retreat. They fled with precipitation to Ajmere. The enemy hung on their rear. The Omrahs wrote &s;eparately letters to court, with accu&s;ations again&s;t each other's conduct. Chan Chanan was recalled to Agra, dive&s;ted of all his employments; and he even thought him&s;elf happy in being able to &s;ave his life. The di&s;grace of this noble|man redounded not to the honour of Chan Jehan. That lord, through who&s;e accu&s;ations Chan Chanan chiefly fell, rendered him&s;elf odious by ingratitude.

Purvez was recalled to the pre&s;ence. The unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of the campaign was a &s;evere blow to that prince.

The army was in too bad a condition, to be &s;uddenly re&s;tored to di&s;cipline and order. Mohabet could not, with any a&s;&s;urance of victory, &s;hew them to the enemy. Jehangire was naturally

impatient. On the &s;econd of Shab&acirc;n, of the one thou&s;and and twenty-&s;econd year of the Higera, he moved the Le&s;car or Im|perial camp, with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of putting him&s;elf at the head of the troops employed again&s;t the Rana. The magnificence of the emperor's progre&s;s to Ajmere, de&s;erves a brief de&s;cription. When the monarchs of Hindo&s;tan take the field, their camps are a kind of moving cities. That of Jehangire, in his pre&s;ent pro|gre&s;s, was in circumference at lea&s;t twenty miles. The Le&s;car is divided, like a regular town, into &s;quares, alleys, and &s;treets. The royal pavilion is always erected in the center: no man rai&s;es his nearer than the di&s;tance of a mu&s;ket|&s;hot around. Every man of quality, every artificer, knows his ground, the &s;pace allotted for him, on which &s;ide, how far from the emperor he mu&s;t pitch his tent. The pavilions of the great officers of the court are, at a di&s;tance, known by their &s;plendor; at hand, by marks which di&s;tingui&s;h the various ranks of the owners. The &s;hops and apartments of trade&s;men are al&s;o known by rule; and no man is for a moment at a lo&s;s how to &s;upply his wants. The Le&s;car, from a ri&s;ing ground, furni&s;hes one of the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pects in the world. Starting up, in a few hours, in an uninhabited plain, it rai&s;es the idea of a city built by enchantment: and fills the mind with delightful wonder and &s;urprize. Even tho&s;e who leave their hou&s;es in cities, to follow the prince in his progre&s;s, are frequently &s;o charmed with the Le&s;car, when &s;ituated in a beautiful and convenient place, that they cannot prevail with them&s;elves to remove. To prevent this inconvenience to the court, the emperor, after &s;ufficient time is allowed to the trade&s;men to follow, orders them to be burnt out of their tents.</P>

Having &s;uper&s;eded Moh&acirc;bet, he entered the mountains without he&s;itation. The enemy was &s;eized with a panic, and fled before him. He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Brampour, the capital of the Rana's dominions, with little oppo&s;ition. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought; but no deci|&s;ive battle. The Rana &s;ued for peace. His &s;on Kinw&acirc;r Kirren came, with magnificent pre&s;ents to the prince. Churrum received him with apparent kindne&s;s and great di&s;tinction. The Rana him&s;elf, encouraged by Churrum's reception of his &s;on, came unexpectedly into the pre&s;ence. He threw him&s;elf at the feet of Churrum; who very courteou&s;ly rai&s;ed him, took him in his arms, and obliged him to &s;it on his right hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rana offers terms.</NOTE>The Rana opened the conference, by excu&s;ing his own beha|viour, the outrages committed by his people: and he extolled the  clemency of the prince, who, though &s;uperior in the field, was willing to grant an equitable peace. Churrum knew that the blame of the war did not re&s;t on the Hindoos. He therefore replied, That excu&s;es on the &s;ide of the Rana were unnece&s;&s;ary; that it was the duty of every prince to exert the power placed in his hands, in defence of his &s;ubjects and dominions; but as war had been kindled, and the fortune of the Mahommedans had prevailed, he thought it his duty to u&s;e his &s;ucce&s;s with moderation; and that he was willing to put an immediate end to all differences, by a &s;olid and la&s;ting peace. The Rana con&s;ented to pay a tribute to the family of Timur. Some di&s;&s;iculties aro&s;e about the &s;um: the deci&s;ion was left to Jehangire.

He al&s;o gave to the prince an Imperial elephant, &s;umptuou&s;ly capari&s;oned; and one hundred fine Per&s;ian hor&s;es. He created him by patent an Omrah of five thou&s;and: but all the&s;e were &s;plendid badges of &s;lavery; and the means of degradation from his former inde|pendence and rank.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Chur|rum in great favour.</NOTE>The &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition into the Decan, rai&s;ed to a high  pitch the reputation of Churrum. His father's affection for him grew with his fame. Men began to turn their eyes upon him, as the heir-apparent of the throne. Jehangire treated him, in his conver&s;ation, with the highe&s;t di&s;tinction; and he &s;eemed anxious to expre&s;s to the world his affection and regard. A court was appointed for him. E&s;tates were &s;ettled upon him, for the maintenance of a body-guard of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, and fifteen thou&s;and foot, &s;ubject only to his commands. Sultan Purvez, in the mean time, declined in his father's e&s;teem in proportion as Churrum ro&s;e.

He, in the mean time, di&s;tributed a va&s;t quantity of pearls and jewels among the nobility, to induce them to pay obedience to the edict. Many, however, were refractory.

In his memoirs of the fir&s;t twelve years of his reign, he excu&s;es the introduction of ear-rings, from a motive of religion, to the &s;uper&s;titions of which, he was by no means often &s;ubject. His father Akbar, it was pretended, by the merit of a pilgrimage to Ajmere, to the learned and religious Chaja Moin|ul-dien, had been ble&s;&s;ed with children. Jehangire was the fir&s;t fruits of this piece of devotion: and he &s;aid, in the preamble to his edict, that he, who was brought into being by the prayers of Chaja, could do no le&s;s than become his &s;lave, and wear the marks of &s;ervitude. His rea&s;ons appeared &s;o ab&s;urd and &s;uper|&s;titious, that &s;ome of the nobles taxed him with favouring ido|latry. The effeminate cu&s;tom was, however, introduced by the weight of the Imperial authority; and it &s;till remains a blot on Jehangire's memory, and a la&s;ting mark of the weakne&s;s of his mind.</P>

In the end of the autumn of the 1024 of the Higera, Sir Thomas Roe, the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador to the court of Agra, arrived at Brampour. Politene&s;s and affability were natural to Purvez. Full of honour and good-nature, his virtues were of the milder ca&s;t: too indolent for the fatigues of bu&s;ine&s;s, diffident of his own abilities. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the per&s;onal courage of a good &s;oldier; but he was de&s;titute of the conduct nece&s;&s;ary to a great general. He followed implicitly the advice of others, when there was no di&s;agreement in their opinions; when there was, he was embarra&s;&s;ed, and could not decide.

He ordered a magnificent palace to be built, in the neighbourhood of Ajmere, for Haf&icirc;za Jemm&acirc;l, the &s;aint's daughter: the holy man him&s;elf, from the au&s;terity of his principles, not chu&s;ing, by an acceptance of pre&s;ents, to depart from the &s;implicity of life and philo&s;ophical character which had rai&s;ed his fame. The palace built for Jemm&acirc;l was remarkable for beauty and &s;ituation. Fine baths were crected over natural fountains; and exten&s;ive gardens were laid out around it, with great elegance and ta&s;te. Tran|quillity prevailed over all the empire. The motions of the army in the Decan were rather parade than war. Luxury prevailed in every form. The magni&s;icence of the favourite Sultana was

beyond all bounds. Expen&s;ive pageants, &s;umptuous entertain|ments, were the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the court. The voice of mu&s;ic never cea&s;ed by day in the &s;treet; the &s;ky was enlightened at night with fire-works and illuminations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador arrives at court.</NOTE>In the mid&s;t of this fe&s;tivity and joy, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador  arrived at Ajmere.

He even prevented the amba&s;&s;ador with expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect for his ma&s;ter, and felicitations to him&s;elf upon his &s;afe arrival at court. The pre&s;ents given by the amba&s;&s;ador were agreeable to the emperor; but a fine coach &s;ent by King James plea&s;ed him mo&s;t of all. He even had the impatience to go into it that very night, and to de&s;ire the amba&s;&s;ador's &s;ervants to draw him around the court of the palace. Sultan Churrum, at the time, was all|powerful in the affairs of the &s;tate. To him the amba&s;&s;ador applied, as lord of Surat, to redre&s;s the grievances of the Engli&s;h at that port. The prince was courteous, and promi&s;ed fair; but he was an enemy to all Chri&s;tians, whom he called Idolaters; and mo&s;t of all an enemy to the Engli&s;h. The emperor's favour for the amba&s;&s;ador prevailed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, over the prince's prejudices and ob&s;tinacy.

He had commanded the Imperial army again&s;t the Rana, in the intermediate &s;pace of time between the recall of Moh&acirc;bet and the arrival of prince Churrum. He was &s;ucce&s;sful; but his glory was ob&s;cured by the &s;uperior reputation of the prince, who &s;uc|ceeded him. Jehangire was not in&s;en&s;ible of the valour and abilities of Abdalla. To leave a fair field to his favourite &s;on, he removed the general to Guzerat. The emperor departed from his u&s;ual humanity, in his in&s;tructions to Abdalla.

The two principal chiefs of the banditti were Eder and La&euml;l. Abdalla &s;at down &s;uddenly before the ca&s;tle of Eder. That chief, not intimidated, marched out and gave him battle. After an ob&s;tinate conflict of &s;ome hours, the Coolies were obliged to fly. Eder took the way of the de&s;art; and left his ca&s;tle and trea&s;ure to the victor. La&euml;l, in the mean time, was on an excur&s;ion of depredation in another corner of Guzerat. He had robbed a great caravan of all its merchandize; and it was the news of this misfortune that directed Abdalla to the enemy. La&euml;l had under him three thou|&s;and hor&s;e and twelve thou&s;and foot: but Abdalla had been rein|forced. The Cooli did not decline battle. The action was bloody.

Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, glad of an opportunity of eclip&s;ing Sultan Purvez, received their &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion upon ea&s;y terms.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;e of the former bad &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE>The &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition was by no means the effect of  Shaw Jeh&acirc;n's prudent and re&s;olute conduct. The way to a pacification had been paved before he left Ajmere. The em|peror, ju&s;tly a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;mall progre&s;s of his arms in the Decan, enquired minutely into the cau&s;e. Chan Chanan, who managed every thing under Sultan Purvez, was &s;ecretly in the pay of the enemy. He clogged every mea&s;ure; and rendered every expedition of no effect. He long endeavoured, by his friends at court, to prevent the removal of Purvez. The emperor had taken his re&s;olution. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was de&s;tined for the command of the army; and Chan Chanan, to deprive him of the honour of a victory over an enemy, who had apparently re&s;i&s;ted all his own and his pupil's efforts, per&s;uaded the confederates to &s;ue for peace, in the Imperial pre&s;ence; without alleging their fear of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n as anyways conducive to their offers of pacification.

His affa|bility, and the beauty of his per&s;on, recommended him to the vulgar; and they loved him on account of his misfortunes. Many cau&s;es concurred to make the emperor adopt this mea&s;ure. He was informed, that &s;ome friends of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n were plotting again&s;t the life of Chu&s;ero. The mini&s;ter, A&s;aph Jah, the fa|vourite Sultana's brother, had al&s;o behaved rudely to the unfor|tunate prince, and betrayed &s;ymptoms of di&s;like and revenge. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was probably at the bottom of all. His friends, without his permi&s;&s;ion, would &s;earce have attempted the life of his brother; and he had been lately married to the daughter of A&s;aph Jah.

An incident at Surat was magnified into an in&s;ult upon the Imperial power, by the prince and his party. The amba&s;&s;a|dor, however, removed the emperor's jealou&s;y: and he had the addre&s;s to gain, at la&s;t, the favour of the prince, the mini&s;ter, and the empre&s;s; and obtained the privileges of trade, which were the object of his emba&s;&s;y.

He cho&s;e rather to maintain the dignity of his rank by the number of his friends, than by that of dome&s;tics, followers, and &s;laves.

He gave him a commi&s;&s;ion to command the Imperial army &s;tationed in and near that city. The prince did not continue long at Agra. He marched, on the twentieth of Siffer, toward Brampour. His force con&s;i&s;ted of forty thou&s;and hor&s;e. Abdul Hu&s;&s;ein, an experienced officer, was his &s;econd in command. Letters came to the prince, on his march, from the Imperial governor of Mando, that a con&s;iderable detachment of the enemy had cro&s;&s;ed the Nirbidda, and were laying wa&s;te the country. Abdul Hu&s;&s;ein was immediately detached again&s;t them, with five thou&s;and hor&s;e. That general came up with the plunderers, defeated them, &s;lew many on the &s;pot, and pur&s;ued the fugitives to the hills. The prince him&s;elf continued his route to Brampour.</P>

They had traver&s;ed the provinces of Ber&acirc;r and Chandei&s;h; and &s;pread their deva&s;tations to the gates of Brampour. The Imperiali&s;ts recovered their &s;pirit, upon the prince's arrival with an army; and the hopes of the in&s;urgents began to vani&s;h. Some petty Rajas, who had

joined the confederates, took the fir&s;t opportunity of throwing them&s;elves at the feet of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. They were pardoned, but obliged to pay the arrear of their tribute, which amounted to fifty lacks. The Mahommedan princes, being de&s;erted by the Hindoo Rajas, their troops mutinied, and di&s;&s;entions ro&s;e in their councils. They &s;eparated in di&s;gui&s;t and de&s;pair, each to his own territory. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n divided his army into five parts, and followed the rebels. In the &s;pace of a few months, without any con&s;iderable action, he reduced the in&s;urgents to their former obedience; forcing them to pay the arrears of their tribute, which was now &s;ettled at the annual &s;um of fifty-five lacks of roupees.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chu&s;ero de|livered into the hands of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n.</NOTE>When Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had received orders from his father to quell the di&s;turbances in the Decan, he reque&s;ted that his brother, the  unfortunate prince Chu&s;ero, might be put into his hands. He had often made the &s;ame reque&s;t before, but to no effect. Jehan|gire ju&s;tly doubted his &s;incerity, when he profe&s;&s;ed, that it was a regard for a brother that induced him to wi&s;h to have Chu&s;ero in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He knew the ambition of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n: he &s;till had an affection for Chu&s;ero. A&s;iph Jah, even the favourite Sultana had gone into the views of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n; but the emperor remained long inflexible. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, for &s;ome time, &s;eemed to drop his de&s;igns. He, in the mean time, grew daily in his father's e&s;teem; and Chu&s;ero declined in proportion as his brother ro&s;e. When the alarming news from the Decan arrived at Lahore, the emperor's hopes re&s;ted all on Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. The artful prince, in the critical moment, renewed his reque&s;t, with regard to Chu&s;ero, and he was delivered into his hands.</P>

The emperor was convinced; but it was too late. Chu&s;ero was already in the hands of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n; and the latter was at the head of an army.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Chu&s;ero.</NOTE>Chu&s;ero, though popular on account of the beauty of his per|&s;on, and his misfortunes, was a prince of a haughty di&s;po&s;ition.  He was governed by furious pa&s;&s;ions. His mind was in a per|petual agitation, without pointing to any end. He was now volatile and cheerful; now dark and &s;ullen. He often laughed at misfortune; he was often enraged at trifles; and his whole conduct betrayed every mark of an in&s;anity of mind. His judg|ment was little: his memory weak. He always preferred the la&s;t advice, having no power of mind to di&s;tingui&s;h propriety, no retention to make ju&s;t compari&s;ons. His de&s;igns were there|fore often ill-founded; his actions irre&s;olute and undeci&s;ive, and they always terminated in di&s;grace and ruin. Yet he had &s;ome|thing about him that commanded re&s;pect in the mid&s;t of his in|firmities. Nobody could look at his conduct without di&s;gu&s;t; none ob&s;erved his manner or &s;aw his per&s;on without regard and a kind of e&s;teem. Had he not been &s;oured by misfortunes, he was naturally of a generous and tender di&s;po&s;ition; but adver&s;ity

But this was a delu&s;ive gleam before a &s;torm. His de&s;igns were not yet ripe for execu|tion. To remove Chu&s;ero would be to no purpo&s;e, till other ob&s;tacles to his own ambition were removed. Fortune favoured his de&s;igns. His &s;ucce&s;s in the Decan rai&s;ed his reputation; the plunder of the enemy furni&s;hed the means of gaining for him the army. They expre&s;&s;ed their inviolable attachment to his per&s;on and views. He threw off the ma&s;k at once. He di&s;re|garded the mandates of the court of Agra; and to complete his crimes, he ordered the unfortunate Chu&s;ero to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by ruffians, under the walls of Azere. He a&s;&s;umed, &s;oon after, the Imperial titles; laying the foundation of his throne in a brother's blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of his death.</NOTE>Though all mankind were convinced, that Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was acce&s;&s;ary to the murder of Chu&s;ero, he had taken previous mea|&s;ures  to conceal the intended crime. When he had quelled the in&s;urrection in the Decan, he became apparently melancholy, and pretended to fall into a di&s;ea&s;e. His friends were full of anxiety. One only was in the &s;ecret; and he began to in&s;inuate, that the prince had received intelligence, that Jehangire had determined to rai&s;e Chu&s;ero to the throne. He expatiated upon the un|certain fate of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n; and upon the doubtfulne&s;s of their own fortune, as connected with that prince. One Raja Bandor, a notorious villain, under&s;tood the meaning of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n's friend. In hopes of a reward, he went at midnight to the tent of Chu&s;ero, and pretending a me&s;&s;age from the emperor, he was admitted by the attendants of the prince, without &s;u&s;|picion.

He found him fa&s;t a&s;leep, and &s;tabbed him to the heart. The favourite wife of Chu&s;ero, the daughter of the vi&s;ier Chan Azem, came to her hu&s;band's tent in the morning. She found him cold in his blood; &s;he filled the camp and the neighbouring city of Azere with her cries. She ran about di&s;tracted, and called down the vengeance of God upon the murderers. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, who had removed to the country for the benefit of the air, returned upon the news of Chu&s;ero's death, and &s;hewed &s;uch apparent fymptoms of grief, that he was believed, for &s;ome time, innocent of the murder.</P>

He &s;u&s;pected Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, but common fame had not yet fixed the crime on that prince. Jehangire wrote a public letter to him and his principal officers, &s;ignifying that he was determined to make a &s;trict and &s;evere enquiry concerning the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and that he would puni&s;h the murderers with the utmo&s;t rigour.

He immediately, with a numerous army, took the route of Delhi, where, at that time, his father re&s;ided. The news of his march flew before him, and reached the ears of Jehangire. That monarch became anxious, irre&s;olute, and perplexed; and to complete the confu&s;ion in his councils, advices were, at the &s;ame time, received, that Shaw Abas, king of Per&s;ia, at the head of a great force, had &s;urpri&s;ed Candahar. The emperor was thunder|&s;truck at this double intelligence of approaching misfortune. The rebellious prince had the flower of the Imperial army under his command. Jehangire, as the la&s;t re&s;ort, had recour&s;e to policy. In&s;tead of arming for his own defence, he diffembled his knowledge of his &s;on's intentions.

Bickermaj&icirc;t, who was &s;lain in the action near Delhi, had been governor of that province; and when he joined the prince in his expedition again&s;t his father, Suffvi Chan was left in the &s;uperintendency of Guzerat. Abdalla, who&s;e perfidy, in de&s;erting his &s;overeign in the late battle, we have al|ready mentioned, was rewarded, by the prince, for his treachery, with the government vacant by the death of Bickermaj&icirc;t. Un|willing to leave the prince in his di&s;tre&s;s, Abdalla di&s;patches his friend Off&acirc;der Chan to command, in the mean time, in that pro|vince. Off&acirc;der arriving with a &s;mall force at Ahmedabad, the capital, di&s;placed Suffvi Chan, the Imperial governor. Suffvi fled to Hank&s;i. He wrote from thence to Na&s;ir, the governor of Patan. Under&s;tanding that Suffvi was no &s;tranger to the march of Sultan Dawir Bux&s;h the &s;on of Chu&s;ero, under the tuition of his maternal grandfather Chan Azem, to command for the emperor in Guzerat, Na&s;ir blamed him for his flight. He met Suffvi, with a force at Caperben&icirc;z. They re&s;olved to march to Ahmed|abad: and &s;etting forward in the evening, they arrived next morning under the walls of the city. Dividing their forces into three bodies; each body attacked a gate. The elephants broke them open: the Imperiali&s;ts entered, and Off&acirc;der was &s;eized.</P>

Abdalla endeavoured to turn his rear. He was prevented by the vigilance of Suffvi; and he, therefore, re&s;olved to come to battle. Dividing his army into three columns, he advanced, in that order, upon the enemy. Na&s;ir Chan &s;upported Suffvi, with his courage and conduct. The battle was ob&s;tinate. Many officers of rank fell on the &s;ide of Abdalla. He was routed, with great &s;laughter. He fled to Surat.

The di&s;turbances in Guzerat convinced Je|hangire, that the flames of civil war could be only extingui&s;hed by the total ruin of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. He, therefore, ordered Pur|vez and Moh&acirc;bet, at the head of the Rajaputs, in the Imperial pay, to pur&s;ue the rebel and to take him alive. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n left Mando, with a re&s;olution to try his fortune in a battle. He pa&s;&s;ed the river Nirbidda and threw up works to defend the ford.

The governor of Orixa, Ahmed Beg, fled on the prince's approach. That province was  given to Kulli Chan, one of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n's adherents; whil&s;t he him&s;elf advanced to Burdwan, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that di&s;trict.

He &s;trengthened them with a reinforcement of his be&s;t troops, whil&s;t he encamped his army on the oppo&s;ite bank of the river. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, upon his arrival, inve&s;ted the fort of Tellia-Gurri. He made little impre&s;|&s;ion; the Europeans being excellent gunners and engineers. He attempted to cro&s;s, but was repul&s;ed, having but a few boats. A neighbouring Raja, however, provided the prince with a fleet of boats; and in the&s;e he tran&s;ported two thou&s;and hor&s;e.

He drew up in order of battle, again&s;t the prince; but in the action his troops were defeated and he him|&s;elf &s;lain. Bengal fell, with the Suba, from the empire. Rumi, the chief engineer of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, in the mean time, found means to carry a mine, under the fort of Tellia-Gurri, and blew up about twenty yards of the rampire.

The Rajas, the hereditary governors of di&s;tricts, and all tho&s;e who held e&s;tates of the crown, crowded into the court of the prince; and with pre&s;ents and proffers of allegiance, endeavoured to &s;ecure their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.

He  &s;carce had permitted his army to breathe after the conque&s;t of Dacca, before he led them into Beh&acirc;r. Muchlis Chan, the Im|perial governor of that province, fled to Allahabad, at the ap|proach of the prince. The gates of Patna, the capital, were left open to receive him. He kept his court in the Suba's palace. The Zemind&acirc;rs crowded, from all quarters, into the city, made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and, with pre&s;ents, obtained his favour. But what was of greater con&s;equence to the prince, Mub&acirc;rick, governor of the impregnable fort of Rhotas, which had never been taken by force, came and pre&s;ented to him the keys. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was exceedingly rejoiced at this piece of good fortune.

Deria Chan was placed, by the prince, over the &s;econd divi&s;ion. That general was ordered to reduce the country round Jionpour. The third divi&s;ion Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, in per&s;on, commanded.

At Hydrabad they gave over the pur&s;uit; and began to employ them&s;elves in re&s;ettling the affairs of the Decan, which the rebellion of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had very much deranged. The news of the lo&s;s of the ea&s;tern provinces alarmed Moh&acirc;bet: Even Jehangire, who pa&s;&s;ed his time in voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, with his favourite Noor-M&acirc;hil, was rouzed from his lethargy. He di&s;patched expre&s;s after ex|pre&s;s to Purvez. The march of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n toward the capital, determined Moh&acirc;bet to endeavour to intercept him on his way. He marched with Purvez through Malava and Beh&acirc;r. He cro&s;&s;|ed the Jumna at Calp&eacute;, and the Ganges at Babere. The Im|perial army came up with Deria, who commanded one of the three divi&s;ions of the rebels, at Manicpour. He was in&s;tantly defeated; and he fell back to Ben&acirc;ris.

his army on the banks of a brook called Toni&s;h. Abdalla com|manded the right wing; Na&s;ir Chan the left; the prince him|&s;elf took his po&s;t in the center.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The army of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n</NOTE>Moh&acirc;bet, in the mean time, was not idle. He formed in or|der  of battle the army of Prince Purvez.

But Sujait was, in his turn, defeated; and driven back in great confu&s;ion.

His of|ficers con&s;idered the battle as lo&s;t, and refu&s;ed to advance. Ab|dalla, who had hitherto maintained his ground on the right, re|ceived a me&s;&s;age from the prince. He returned for an&s;wer, that all hopes of victory were gone, and that the be&s;t retreat they could make, was now the only thing left them by fortune. The prince was enraged. He re&s;olved to die.

He was, however, tired of rapine; worn down by contention and ho&s;tility. He wrote letters of compunction to his father. He enlarged on his own guilt; he even added, if po&s;&s;ible, to his own wretched|ne&s;s and misfortune. Jehangire was often full of affection; he was always weak. He was &s;hocked at the mi&s;erable condition of a &s;on, whom he once had loved.

His &s;on, Channa Z&acirc;d, had been lately  gratified with the government of Cabul; and others, his rela|tions and friends, were advanced to lucrative and honourable em|ployments. The great victory near Ben&acirc;ris confirmed the em|peror's high opinion of Moh&acirc;bet, and the news of that impor|tant event filled him with exce&s;&s;ive joy. His grateful feelings for his general ro&s;e in proportion to the decrea&s;e of his fears for his throne. The&s;e &s;entiments, however, did not long con|tinue. Moh&acirc;bet had a great many enemies: his &s;overeign had but little firmne&s;s.

It was by that lord's advice, that he cut off Chu&s;ero: by his advice he rebelled again&s;t his father. He accompanied the prince in his expedition to Agra and Delhi; and, though he took no part in the fatigues of the field, he ruled in the cabinet. When the affairs of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n became de&s;perate, after his retreat to the Decan, he advi&s;ed him to &s;ue for a pardon, through his brother Purvez. He him&s;elf undertook to be his me&s;&s;enger to Purvez, to who&s;e temper and character he could have been no &s;tranger. When he arrived in the Imperial camp, he found no di&s;po&s;ition in Moh&acirc;bet to relinqui&s;h by terms, the advantages which had been obtained by the &s;word. Having failed in his endeavours for the prince, he applied for him&s;elf. Moh&acirc;bet was &s;hocked at this reiteration of treachery; and he per&s;uaded Purvez to throw him and his family into pri|&s;on. The latter were &s;ent, under an e&s;cort, to Agra; he him|&s;elf was detained, in clo&s;e confinement, in the camp, and his e&s;tate was confi&s;cated by an Imperial edict.</P>

He wrote to the Sultana: he &s;ent letters to A&s;iph. He informed them that Moh&acirc;bet was forming de&s;igns to rai&s;e Purvez to the throne. This was carried to the emperor's ears. He ordered Chan Chanan to be relea&s;ed: and that Omrah, who remained with Purvez, accu&s;ed Moh&acirc;bet, by letters to the emperor, of intended trea&s;on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor alarmed.</NOTE>Jehangire, naturally &s;u&s;picious, was alarmed. The &s;pirit of  jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind. He forgot the &s;ervices of Moh&acirc;bet in his own fears. He ordered him to court; and rai&s;ed Chan Jeh&acirc;n Lodi from the government of Guzerat to the command of the army under Purvez. Moh&acirc;bet, before the em|peror's orders arrived, had &s;et out with Purvez, for Bengal. He had been guilty of a neglect, which gave colour to the accu&s;ations of his enemies. The elephants taken in battle are Imperial property. The&s;e he had retained, together with the pre&s;ents which his &s;on Channa Z&acirc;d had received in re&s;ettling the pro|vince. A &s;econd peremptory order was &s;ent to him. He was acquainted, that he was appointed to the &s;uba&s;hip of Pun|j&acirc;b; but that the emperor deprived him of Lahore, which had been u&s;ually annexed to that government.

He re&s;olved to retire to his ca&s;tle of Rintimpour: but an order arrived to deliver that fortre&s;s into the hands of one of the Sultana's creatures. This latter circum&s;tance confirmed what his friends at court had written to him before, that his life was in danger, &s;hould he tru&s;t him&s;elf in the Imperial pre&s;ence. He wrote to Jehangire.

He di&s;patched a courier, with his la&s;t commands for his appearance. He at length re|&s;olved to obey.

they were afraid of his force. They per&s;uaded the emperor not to admit him into the camp. When, therefore, he arrived near the tents, he was ordered to &s;top, till he accounted for the revenues of Bengal, and the plunder taken at the battle of Ben&acirc;ris. Moh&acirc;bet was enraged: he di&s;patched his &s;on-in-law to the emperor, to complain of an indignity &s;o unworthy of his fidelity and &s;ervices. He could not have cho&s;en a wor&s;e me&s;|&s;enger. The emperor had been much offended with Moh&acirc;bet, for giving his daughter in marriage without his con&s;ent; and he had re&s;olved to be revenged. When, therefore, the young lord alighted from his elephant in the Imperial &s;quare, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized; he was &s;tript of his clothes, covered with rags, ba&s;tinadoed, and &s;ent out of the camp riding backward on a &s;orry jade, amid the &s;houts of the whole army.</P>

re&s;olved to &s;ave him from public di&s;grace. Moh&acirc;bet was alarm|ed. He e&s;caped from the camp. The army lay that day on the banks of the Gelum, in the very &s;pot where the emperor had &s;even months before been &s;eized. Moh&acirc;bet, after having the whole power of the empire in his hands, was obliged to fly from that very place, without a &s;ingle attendant. He carried nothing with him but his life: his wealth was left in the Im|perial camp, and became the property of Noor-Jeh&acirc;n. His flight had &s;carce become public, when an edict was i&s;&s;ued by the Sultana's procurement, to all the governors of provinces to make diligent &s;earch for him. He was declared a rebel, and a reward was put upon his head.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His confer|ence</NOTE>A&s;iph di&s;approved of his &s;i&s;ter's violence. He knew the merit  of Moh&acirc;bet: he was not forgetful of his kindne&s;s to him&s;elf, when under his power. He was tired, be&s;ides, of the weakne&s;s of Jehangire, and of the Sultana's tyranny. He, however, ob|&s;erved a cautious &s;ilence. His power depended upon his &s;i&s;ter; and &s;he was haughty as well as vindictive. Moh&acirc;bet flew from place to place. He took, at fir&s;t, the route of Tatta; but the un|fortunate have enemies every where. The boldne&s;s, which had lately rai&s;ed him to the &s;ummit of power, for&s;ook him not in his di&s;tre&s;s. He mounted his hor&s;e; and rode &s;olitary near four hundred miles, to throw him&s;elf into the conver&s;ation of A&s;iph. That mini&s;ter, at the time, was in the Imperial camp at Karnal, on the road between Lahore and Delhi. Moh&acirc;bet, in a mean habit, entered the camp when it was dark; and about nine o'clock placed him&s;elf in the pa&s;&s;age, which led from the apartments of A&s;iph to the Haram. The cunuch, who &s;tood at the door, que&s;tioned Moh&acirc;bet. He knew that lord by his voice; but he a&s;&s;ured him of his &s;idelity. Moh&acirc;bet told him, that he wi&s;hed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">with A&s;iph</NOTE>When A&s;iph &s;aw the low condition into which he, who lately  commanded the empire, was fallen, he could &s;carce refrain from tears. He took him in his arms: they retired in &s;ilence to a &s;ecret place. Moh&acirc;bet, after mentioning the ingratitude of Noor-Jeh&acirc;n, complained of the imbecillity of the emperor, and plainly told the vi&s;ier, that, low as he was reduced, he was deter|mined to rai&s;e up another &s;overeign in India. <Q REND="inline">"Purvez," con|tinued Moh&acirc;bet, "is a virtuous man, and my friend.

He is ambitious, and &s;ome|times &s;evere; but he will aggrandize the empire abroad, and add vigour and preci&s;ion to the laws at home."</Q>&mdash;A&s;iph was over|joyed at this declaration.

Moh&acirc;bet, mounting his hor&s;e, dived into the night: A&s;iph  went into the pre&s;ence. The emperor was much alarmed at the news from the Decan, that his rebellious &s;on had collected an army. He regretted the lo&s;s of Moh&acirc;bet, and A&s;iph took that opportunity of &s;uing for his pardon. The emperor, in the warmth

of his zeal again&s;t his &s;on, ordered an edict of indemnity to be forthwith i&s;&s;ued, which re&s;tored Moh&acirc;bet to his honours and e&s;tates. A commi&s;&s;ion was given him to command the army again&s;t Shaw Jeh&acirc;n; and the ceremony of giving thanks in the pre&s;ence, was di&s;pen&s;ed with in his favour, as he could not tru&s;t his life to the mercy of Noor-Jeh&acirc;n.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Purvez.</NOTE>An event, however, happened, which rendered the&s;e preparations  again&s;t Shaw Jeh&acirc;n unnece&s;&s;ary. That prince de&s;i&s;ted from his new enterprize without the interpo&s;ition of force. When Moh&acirc;|bet carried all before him at court, his friend and pupil, the prince Purvez, remained at the head of the army, and command|ed all the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern provinces in great tranquillity. He took no notice of his father's confinement; and he u&s;ed no means for his relea&s;ement. He knew that Moh&acirc;bet had no de|&s;igns upon the empire; and he was rather plea&s;ed, with a check upon the emperor, which might prove an excu&s;e to him&s;elf, from being bound by his commands. In the mid&s;t of the in&s;en|&s;ibility and tranquillity of Purvez, he was &s;eized by an apoplexy, which carried him off in the thirty-eighth year of his age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE>Sultan Purvez was one of tho&s;e harmle&s;s men that pa&s;s with|out either envy or fame through life.

Ea&s;e was his only comfort; toil his &s;ole aver&s;ion. Though battles were gained in his name, he was rather an incumbrance to an army, than the &s;pring which &s;hould move the whole. Without ambi|tion to command, he thought it no indignity to obey. He ap|proved of the coun&s;el of others, without ever propo&s;ing his own.

re&s;pect, where he impre&s;&s;ed no awe; and even men who knew his weakne&s;s, li&s;tened with attention to his commands. His con&s;titution was feeble and lethargic; his life a perpetual &s;lumber. Had he lived, he was de&s;tined for the throne; and, as he had no pa&s;&s;ions to gratify, the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of his reign would depend on tho&s;e whom chance might place around him. His death was regretted, more, perhaps, than that of an abler man might have been. He never committed injuries, and mankind gave him credit for benevolence.

Twenty-two lacks, under an e&s;cort, were advanced as far as Delhi, when the flight of Moh&acirc;bet happened; and the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger, who brought the news of the trea&s;ure to the emperor, brought him al&s;o intelligence of the death of Purvez.

<P><MILESTONE N="1627" UNIT="A.D."><MILESTONE N="1037" UNIT="Hig."><NOTE PLACE="marg">Schemes of Moh&acirc;bet.</NOTE>MOHABET, after his conference with A&s;iph, made the be&s;t of his way to the dominions of the Rana. He had been recommended by letters from the vi&s;ier, to that prince; and he  was received with extraordinary marks of di&s;tinction. A cir|cum&s;tance, omitted in its place, will contribute to throw light on the &s;equel. A corre&s;pondence, by writing, between Moh&acirc;bet and A&s;iph would be a mea&s;ure full of peril to both. They had re|&s;olved to &s;eize upon the accidents that might ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of time, for the &s;ervice of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. The vi&s;ier was to be the judge, as having the be&s;t acce&s;s to know the period fit for their purpo&s;e, from his re&s;idence at court and intimate knowledge of its affairs. Moh&acirc;bet left a ring in his hands, which, when it &s;hould be &s;ent, was the &s;ignal for him to e&s;pouse openly the inte|re&s;ts of the prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the emperor.</NOTE>The edict of indemnity to Moh&acirc;bet had &s;carce been promul|gated, when that lord under&s;tood from court, that the emperor

began to decline vi&s;ibly in his health. The pro&s;pect of his ap|proaching di&s;&s;olution rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary to wre&s;t from him by force a &s;cepter which he was &s;oon to re&s;ign to death. Moh&acirc;bet remained quiet with the Rana; who, holding a friendly corre&s;pond|ence with Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, took an opportunity of informing that prince, that his noble gue&s;t was no enemy to his cau&s;e.&mdash;Jehan|gire had, for &s;even years, been troubled with a &s;light a&s;thma. His di&s;order increa&s;ed toward the end of the preceding year; and he re&s;olved to make a progre&s;s to Ca&s;hmire, for the benefit of the air. The autumn proved very &s;evere in that elevated country. He was &s;eized with a violent cold, which fell upon his lungs. The &s;harpne&s;s and purity of the air rendered his breathing diffi|cult. He complained of a kind of &s;uffocation; and became impa|tient <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 27th.</NOTE> under his di&s;order. He commanded the camp to move, with &s;low marches, toward Lahore. He was carried in a litter as far as the town of Mutti, which &s;tands about half way on the road from Ca&s;hmire. At Mutti his difficulty of breathing in|crea&s;ed. He was growing wor&s;e every day, and the army halted. On the ninth of November of the year 1627 he expired; having lived fifty-eight and reigned twenty-two lunar years and eight months.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE>Jehangire was neither vicious nor virtuous in the extreme.  His bad actions proceeded from pa&s;&s;ion; and his good frequently from whim. Violent in his mea&s;ures without cruelty, merciful without feeling, proud without dignity, and generous without acquiring friends. A &s;lave to his plea&s;ures, yet a lover of bu&s;i|ne&s;s; de&s;titute of all religion, yet full of &s;uper&s;tition and vain fears. Firm in nothing but in the invariable rigour of his ju&s;tice, he was changeable in his opinions, and often the dupe of tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;ed. Sometimes calm, winning, and benevolent, he gained the affections of tho&s;e who knew him not; at other
<PB N="102" REF="263">
times, moro&s;e, captious, re&s;erved, he became terrible to tho&s;e in whom he mo&s;t confided. In public, he was familiar, complai&s;ant, and ea&s;y to all; he made no di&s;tinction between high and low; he heard, with patience, the complaints of the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects; and greatne&s;s was never a &s;ecurity again&s;t his ju&s;tice: in private, he was thoughtful, cold, and &s;ilent; and he often clothed his countenance with &s;uch terror, that A&s;iph J&acirc;h frequently fled from his pre&s;ence, and the Sultana, in the plenitude of her in|fluence over him, was known to approach him on trembling knees. His affection for his children bordered on weakne&s;s. He was as forgetful of injuries as he was of favours. In war he had no abilities; he was fond of peace and tranquillity; and rather a lover than an encourager of the arts of eivil life. Naturally aver&s;e to tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, property was &s;ecure under his admini&s;tration: he had no avarice him&s;elf to render him unju&s;t, and he was the determined and implacable enemy of extortion in others. He was a man of &s;cience and of literary abilities; and the memoris of his life, which he penned him&s;elf, do him more honour as a good writer, than the matter, as a great monarch. Upon the whole, Jehangire, though not a faultle&s;s man, was far from being a bad prince: he had an inclination to be virtuous, and his errors proceeded from a defect more than from a depravity of &s;oul: His mother was thought to have introduced a tincture of madne&s;s into his blood; and an immoderate u&s;e of wine and opium rendered &s;ometimes frantic a mind naturally inflamed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His private life and opi|nions.</NOTE>Though Jehangire was often &s;erious and di&s;tant among his  dome&s;tics, he was fond of throwing off the character of the em|peror, and of enjoying freely the conver&s;ation of his &s;ubjects. He often di&s;appeared in the evening from the palace, and dived into ob&s;cure punch-hou&s;es, to pa&s;s &s;ome hours in drinking and talking with the lower &s;ort. He had no enemies, and he was under no
<PB N="103" REF="264">
apprehen&s;ions concerning the &s;afety of his per&s;on. Being in the hall of audience, acce&s;&s;ible to all ranks of men, after the per|formance of the u&s;ual ceremonies, he was often known in his nocturnal excur&s;ions. But the people loved his familiar openne&s;s, and did not by rudene&s;s abu&s;e the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their prince. He often de&s;ired his companions at the bowl to a&s;k no favours of him, le&s;t SELIM, in his cups, might promi&s;e what JEHANGIRE, in his &s;ober &s;en&s;es, would not chu&s;e to perform. When the liquor began to inflame him, he was rather mad than intoxicated. He flew from one extreme of pa&s;&s;ion to another; this moment joyful, the next melancholy and drowned in tears. When in this &s;ituation, he was fond of arguing upon ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects. Religion was his favourite topic. He &s;ometimes prai&s;ed the Mahommedan faith, &s;ometimes that of the Chri&s;tians; he was now a follower of Zoroa&s;ter, and now of Brahma. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e devout profe&s;&s;ions, he would, &s;ometimes, as &s;tarting from a dream, exclaim, That the prophets of all nations were impo&s;tors; and that he him&s;elf, &s;hould his indolence permit him, could form a better &s;y&s;tem of religion than any they had impo&s;ed on the world. When he was &s;ober, he was dive&s;ted of every idea of religion, having been brought up a Dei&s;t under the tuition of his father Akbar.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing a new faith.</NOTE>The variety of opinions, on the &s;ubject of religion, which pre|vailed  in India, occa&s;ioned great unea&s;ine&s;s both to Jehangire and his father Akbar. The tenets of Mahommedani&s;m, which the family of Timur had brought along with them into their con|que&s;ts, were the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; but the majority of their &s;ubjects were of different per&s;ua&s;ions. The followers of the Brahmin faith were the mo&s;t numerous, and the next were the Per&s;ian Guebres, who wor&s;hipped the element of Fire, as the be&s;t repre&s;entative of God. The Chri&s;tians of Europe and of Ar|menia
<PB N="104" REF="265">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal factories in the principal cities and ports, and they wandered in pur&s;uit of commerce over all the empire. The different opinions among all the&s;e &s;ects, on a &s;ubject which mankind reckon of the la&s;t importance, were the &s;ource of di&s;|putes, animo&s;ities, and quarrels. Akbar was chagrined. He tolerated every religion; he admitted men of all per&s;ua&s;ions into his confidence and &s;ervice; and he had formed &s;erious thoughts of promulgating a new faith, which might reconcile the minds of all his &s;ubjects. He e&s;teemed him&s;elf as equal in abilities to Mahommed, and he had more power to enforce his doctrine. But, fore&s;eeing the di&s;tractions which this arduous mea&s;ure might occa&s;ion, he dropt his de&s;ign; and, in&s;tead of e&s;tablishing a new faith, contented him&s;elf with giving no credit to any of the old &s;y&s;tems of religion. Jehangire in his youth had imbibed his father's principles. He began to write a new code of divine law; but he had neither the au&s;terity nor the abilities of a pro|phet. He &s;hewed more wi&s;dom in relinqui&s;hing, than in forming &s;uch a vi&s;ionary &s;cheme.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His violence.</NOTE>Jehangire was &s;ubject to violent pa&s;&s;ions upon many occa&s;ions. Complaints again&s;t his nobles, and even again&s;t his favourite &s;ons,  were received with an eagerne&s;s, and a rage again&s;t the offenders, more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cribed. When his mind was heated with a relation of oppre&s;&s;ion, he often bur&s;t out into a loud excla|mation, <Q REND="inline">"Who in my empire has dared to do this wrong?"</Q> His violence flew before the accu&s;ation; and to name any per&s;on to him, was to convince him of his guilt. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had been known, when in the greate&s;t favour, to have come trembling be|fore his father, at the accu&s;ation of the meane&s;t &s;ubject; and the whole mini&s;try, and the &s;ervants of the court, frequently &s;tood aba&s;hed, pale, di&s;tant, and in terror for them&s;elves, when a poor man in rags was relating his grievances to the emperor.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="266">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;tance</NOTE>His exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity in the execution of impartial ju&s;tice, was the great line which marks the features of the character of Jehangire. He had no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, when he animadverted  upon crimes. His former favour was obliterated at once by guilt; and he per&s;evered, with undeviating rigour, to revenge upon the great, the injuries done to the low. The &s;tory of Seif Alla remains as a monument of his &s;avage ju&s;tice. The &s;i&s;ter of the favourite Sultana had a &s;on by her hu&s;band Ibrahim, the Suba of Bengal, who, from his tender years, had been brought up at court by the empre&s;s, who having no &s;ons by Jehangire, adopted Seif Alla for her own. The emperor was fond of the boy; he even often &s;eated him upon his throne. At twelve years of age Alla returned to his father in Bengal. Jehangire gave him a letter to the Suba, with orders to appoint him governor of Burd|wan. Alla, after having re&s;ided in his government &s;ome years, had the misfortune, when he was one day riding on an elephant through the &s;treet, to tread by accident a child to death. The parents of the child followed Alla to his hou&s;e. They loudly demanded an exemplary puni&s;hment on the driver; and the governor, con&s;idering it an accident, refu&s;ed their reque&s;t, and ordered them to be driven away from his door. They abu&s;ed him in very opprobrious terms; and Alla, proud of his rank and family, expelled them from the di&s;trict of Burdwan.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of his &s;eve|rity</NOTE>Jehangire re&s;iding, at that time, in the city of Lahore, they found their way, after a long journey on foot, to the pre&s;ence.  They called aloud for ju&s;tice; and the emperor wrote a letter to Alla with his own hand, with peremptory orders to re&s;tore to the injured parents of the child their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to make them ample amends for their lo&s;s and the fatigue of their journey. The pride of Alla was hurt, at the victory obtained over him; and in&s;tead of obeying the orders of his prince, he threw them into pri&s;on,
<PB N="106" REF="267">
till they made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him for their conduct. But as &s;oon as they were relea&s;ed, they travelled again to Lahore. Alla was alarmed, and wrote letters to the Sultana and A&s;iph J&acirc;h, to prevent the petitioners from being admitted into the pre&s;ence. They hovered to no effect, for &s;ome months, about the palace. They could not even come within hearing of the emperor, till one day, that he was taking his plea&s;ure in a barge upon the river. They pre&s;&s;ed forward through the crowd; and thrice called out aloud for ju&s;tice. The emperor heard them, and he recollected their per&s;ons. He ordered the barge to be rowed, that in&s;tant, to the bank; and, before he inquired into the nature of their complaint, he wrote an order for them to receive a pen&s;ion for life, from the Imperial trea&s;ury. When they had explained their grievances, he &s;aid not a word, but he commanded Alla to appear immediately at court.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in the execu|tion of ju&s;|tice.</NOTE>Alla obeyed the Imperial command; but he knew not the in|tentions of Jehangire, which that prince had locked up in his  own brea&s;t. The youth encamped with his retinue, the night of his arrival, on the oppo&s;ite bank of the river; and &s;ent a me&s;|&s;enger to announce his coming to the emperor. Jehangire gave orders for one of his elephants of &s;tate to be ready, by the dawn of day; and he at the &s;ame time directed the parents of the child to attend. He him&s;elf was up before it was light, and having cro&s;&s;ed the river, he came to the camp of Alla, and commanded him to be bound. The parents were mounted upon the ele|phant; and the emperor ordered the driver to tread the unfortu|nate young man to death. But the driver, afraid of the re&s;ent|ment of the Sultana, pa&s;&s;ed over him &s;everal times, without giving the elephant the nece&s;&s;ary directions. The emperor, however, by his threats obliged him at la&s;t to execute his orders. He retired home in &s;ilence; and i&s;&s;ued out his com|mands
<PB N="107" REF="268">
to bury Alla with great pomp and magnificence, and that the court &s;hould go into mourning for him for the &s;pace of two moons.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"I loved him;" &s;aid Jehangire, "but ju&s;tice, like ne|ce&s;&s;ity, &s;hould bind monarchs."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of his hu|manity.</NOTE>The &s;evere ju&s;tice of Jehangire e&s;tabli&s;hed tranquillity through  all his dominions, when they were not di&s;turbed by the ambi|tion of his &s;ons. The Subas of provinces avoided oppre&s;&s;ion, as the poor had a determined avenger of their wrongs, in their &s;o|vereign. He upon every occa&s;ion affected the conver&s;ation of the lower &s;ort.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE>THE ideas upon government which the Tartars of the nor|thern A&s;ia carried into their conque&s;ts in Hindo&s;tan, were often fatal to the po&s;terity of Timur. Monarchy de&s;cends through  the channel of primogeniture; but de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t never fall into the hands of a minor. The prince is the center of union be|tween all the members of the &s;tate; and, when he happens to be a child, the ties which bind the allegiance of the &s;ubject are di&s;&s;olved. Habituated to battle, and inured to depredation, the Tartars always adopted for their leader, that per&s;on of the family of their princes who was mo&s;t proper for their own mode of life; and lo&s;t &s;ight of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the convenience of the nation. When they &s;ettled in better regions than their native country, they did not lay a&s;ide a cu&s;tom &s;uited only to incur&s;ion and war. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne was never determined by e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; and a door was opened to intrigue, to murder, and to civil war. Every prince, as if in an enemy's country, mounted the throne through conque&s;t; and the
<PB N="114" REF="275">
&s;afety of the &s;tate, as well as his own, forced him, in a manner, to become an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and to &s;tain the day of his acce&s;&s;ion with the blood of his relations. When therefore the De&s;pot died, am|bition was not the only &s;ource of broils among his &s;ons. They contended for life as well as for the throne; under a certainty that the fir&s;t mu&s;t be lo&s;t, without a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;econd. Self-pre&s;ervation, that fir&s;t principle of the human mind, converted frequently the humane prince into a cruel tyrant, and thus nece&s;&s;ity prompted men to actions, which their &s;ouls perhaps abhorred.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acce&s;&s;ion of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n.</NOTE>Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had this apology for the murder of his rela|tions;  and the manners of the people were &s;o much adapted to an idea of nece&s;&s;ity in &s;uch a ca&s;e, that they acquie&s;ced with|out murmuring under his government. He mounted the throne of the Moguls in Agra, on the fir&s;t of February of the year 1628 of the Chri&s;tian Aera; and, according to the pompous man|ner of ea&s;tern princes, a&s;&s;umed the titles of THE TRUE STAR OF THE FAITH, THE SECOND LORD OF THE HAPPY CONJUNC|TIONS, MAHOMMED, THE KING OF THE WORLD. He was born at Lahore on the fifth of January 1592, and, on the day of his acce&s;&s;ion, he was thirty-&s;ix &s;olar years and twenty-eight days old. To drive away the memory of the late a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations from the minds of the people, and to gratify the nobles, who had crowded from every quarter to Agra, he u&s;hered in his reign with a fe&s;tival, which exceeded every thing of the kind known in that age, in magnificence and expence. The pompous &s;hews of the favourite Sultana, in the late reign, vani&s;hed in the &s;u|perior grandeur of tho&s;e exhibited by Shaw Jeh&acirc;n.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions.</NOTE>In the mid&s;t of fe&s;tivity and joy, Shaw Jeh&acirc;n did neither for|get the &s;tate nor the gratitude which he owed to his friends.

of his &s;tation, and as a reward for the part he acted, in &s;ecuring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne to the emperor, amounted to near a million &s;terling. Moh&acirc;bet who, in Shaw Jeh&acirc;n's progre&s;s from the Decan to Agra, had been pre&s;ented with the government of Ajmere, was rai&s;ed to the high office of captain-general of all the forces, and to the title and dignity of Chan Chanan, or fir&s;t of the nobles. His &s;on Chanaz&acirc;d, who had been rai&s;ed to the title of Chan Zim&acirc;n, was placed in the government of Malava. Beh&acirc;r was conferred on Chan Alum, Bengal on Ca&s;im, Allaha|b&acirc;d on Jan&s;apar Chan. The emperor, in be&s;towing the province of Cabul on Li&s;c&acirc;r, exhibited an in&s;tance of ju&s;tice. He had, during his rebellion, taken eight lacks of roupees by force from that Omrah, and when he appointed him to Cabul, he at the &s;ame time gave him a draught on the trea&s;ury for the money; &s;ignifying to Li&s;c&acirc;r, <Q REND="inline">"That nece&s;&s;ity being removed, there was no excu&s;e for the continuance of inju&s;tice."</Q> Fifty Mahommedan nobles, together with many Indian Rajas, were rai&s;ed to honours, and gratified with pre&s;ents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;iph arrives at Agra.</NOTE>During the&s;e tran&s;actions at Agra, A&s;iph pur&s;ued his journey  in very &s;low marches from Lahore. His &s;i&s;ter, the favourite of the late emperor, being ruined in all her &s;chemes of ambition, was left, in a kind of con&s;inement at Lahore, in the Imperial palace. The four &s;ons of the reigning emperor, Dara, Suja, Aurungz&ecirc;be, and Mor&acirc;d, had been &s;ent as ho&s;tages for their father's good be|haviour to Jehangire.

The emperor was &s;o much rejoiced at the &s;ight of his children, who had been all

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Children of the emperor.</NOTE>The Imperial prince Dara Sh&ecirc;ko was thirteen years old at the  acce&s;&s;ion of his father to the throne; Suja was in the twelfth, Aurungz&ecirc;be in the tenth, and Mor&acirc;d in the fourth lunar year of his age. The elde&s;t of the emperor's children, by the favou|rite Sultana, the daughter of A&s;iph, was the prince&s;s Jeh&acirc;nara, which name &s;ignifies THE ORNAMENT OF THE WORLD. She was fourteen years of age when Shaw Jeh&acirc;n mounted the throne. Sen&s;ible, lively and generous, elegant in her per&s;on, and accom|pli&s;hed in her mind, &s;he obtained an ab&s;olute empire over her father. A &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;ition with the open and &s;incere Dara, attached her to the intere&s;t of that prince; and he owed, in a great mea&s;ure, the favour of his father to her influence. Ro&s;henrai Begum, or THE PRINCESS OF THE ENLIGHTENED MIND, was the &s;econd daughter of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, and his fourth child by the favourite Sultana. Her wit was &s;harp and penetrating, her judgment &s;ound, her manner engaging like her per&s;on; &s;he was full of addre&s;s, and calculated for &s;tratagem and intrigue. She re&s;embled the pervading genius of Aurungz&ecirc;be, and &s;he favour|ed his de&s;igns. The emperor's third daughter was Suria B&acirc;nu, or THE SPLENDID PRINCESS; a name &s;uited to her exqui&s;ite beauty. She was ea&s;y and gentle in her temper, &s;oft and plea&s;|ing in her addre&s;s, humane, benevolent and &s;ilent: aver&s;e to du|plicity and art, full of dignity and honourable pride.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the empire.</NOTE>Shaw Jeh&acirc;n found him&s;elf in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the exten&s;ive empire of his father, and he had abilities to govern it with dignity, ju&s;tice and preci&s;ion. Tranquillity was e&s;tabli&s;hed  at home; and there were no enemies to di&s;turb him from abroad. Shaw Abas &s;oon after died in Per&s;ia; and the &s;cepter fell into the weak and inactive hands of his grand&s;on Se&s;i; a prince, incapable of either governing his &s;ubjects with dignity, or of giving any di&s;turbance to his neighbours. The &s;pirit of the U&s;becs had declined; and they were exhau&s;ted by di&s;|puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ions and civil wars. The Indian nations, beyond the pale of the empire, were peaceable and unwarlike: incapable of committing injuries, and too di&s;tant from the &s;eat of govern|ment to receive them. The Portugueze, though the mo&s;t power|ful European nation in India, were not formidable to the empire, though hated by the prince. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, when in arms again&s;t his father, had &s;olicited their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They had not only re|fu&s;ed him their aid, but, in a manly manner, reproached him for having demanded it again&s;t his parent and &s;overeign. He was &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of the reproof, and therefore could not forgive it. The Sultana was their enemy. She had accom|panied her hu&s;band to one of their &s;ettlements; and &s;he was en|raged beyond mea&s;ure again&s;t them for the wor&s;hip they paid to images.</P>

Moh&acirc;bet was ordered with a force again&s;t the refractory general; and Ni&s;har, on account of his not having acted with a proper &s;pirit, was recalled.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion</NOTE>The confu&s;ions occa&s;ioned by the di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, after the death of Jehangire, rouzed the ambition of Shaw Kull, prince of  the U&s;bee Tartars. He looked upon a civil war as a certain event in India; and he re&s;olved to &s;eize on the opportunity pre&s;ented by Fortune. He ordered ten thou&s;and of his be&s;t hor&s;e under Nidder Mahommed, accompanied with a good train of artil|lery, to penetrate into the province of Cabul.

They &s;oon advanced  their batteries to the counter&s;carp of the ditch, and, by a con&s;tant fire, made &s;everal breaches in the wall. Ziffer, the late Suba, had left the place; and Li&s;c&acirc;r, the new governor, was not yet arrived. The command of the garri&s;on was in Jacob Chan; who defended him&s;elf &s;o well, that the enemy was beat back with great lo&s;s in

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Repul&s;ed.</NOTE>The news of the inva&s;ion had, in the mean time, arrived at the  court of Agra; and the emperor, finding that Moh&acirc;bet had &s;ettled the affairs of the Decan, ordered that general to the relief of Cabul. Having left his &s;on in his command in the &s;outh, Moh&acirc;bet ha&s;tened with all expedition to the north. Twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e attended him; and he was to take up the forces of Punj&acirc;b on his way. The &s;iege had now continued three months; the U&s;becs had again made a practicable breach, and the ditch was almo&s;t filled, when the news of the march of Moh&acirc;bet arrived in the camp of Mahommed. He redoubled his diligence; and the garri&s;on, who knew nothing of &s;uccour, began to de&s;pair.

He added contempt to his refu&s;al; by &s;ending a thou|&s;and roupees, a hor&s;e, and a dre&s;s to the prince, as to a per&s;on of inferior dignity to him&s;elf. The me&s;&s;enger of Lodi, how|ever, had not the courage to deliver the humiliating pre&s;ent.

Having given the&s;e directions to the &s;hepherd, the me&s;&s;enger proceeded to Shaw Jeh&acirc;n.

An edict of indemnity had been promulgated to all the Omrahs who had oppo&s;ed the acce&s;&s;ion of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n to the throne; and Lodi thought that there was no probability of his being excluded from the indul|gence granted to others.

The u&s;her, Peri&s;t, obliged him to exhibit &s;ome ceremonies of obe|dience, incon&s;i&s;tent with the rank which he held among the nobility. He was &s;omewhat refractory, but he thought it prudent to &s;ubmit. His &s;on, Azmut Chan, was introduced after his father. The youth was then but &s;ixteen years of age. He thought that the u&s;her kept him too long pro&s;trate upon the ground; and he &s;tarted up before the &s;ignal for ri&s;ing was given.

He was &s;topt by the river Chunbil, which was &s;o high, &s;o rough and rapid, on account of the rains, that he could not &s;wim acro&s;s it, and all the boats had been carried down by the &s;tream. This was an unexpected and terrible check; but as the weather was now fair, he hoped that the torrent would &s;oon fall; and in that expectation, he and his followers &s;tood on the bank. In the mid&s;t of his anxiety, the Imperial troops appeared. He called his people together, and told them, he was re&s;olved to die in arms. There was a pa&s;s behind him, which opened between two hills into a narrow plain.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He detaches</NOTE>The emperor, in the mean time, was piqued at the inattention  which princes, whom he con&s;idered as tributaries, had &s;hewn to his emba&s;&s;y. He re&s;olved upon revenge. The Nizam, as being the fir&s;t who had received Lodi under his protection, was the fir&s;t object of his re&s;entment. He rai&s;ed Eradit, the governor of Chandei&s;h, to the title of Azim Chan, and &s;ubmitted an army of twenty-five thou&s;and men to his command. The force was not judged &s;ufficient for the reduction of the Nizam; but the emperor would not tru&s;t Eradit with the ab&s;olute command of a more nu|merous army. He fell upon the expedient of detaching two other armies, con&s;i&s;ting each of fourteen thou&s;and hor&s;e, under the &s;e|parate commands of Raja Gop Singh and Shai&s;ta Chan. The&s;e two generals were to act in conjunction with Eradit, but they were not ab&s;olutely under his orders. The three armies began their march from the capital of Chandei&s;h, about the vernal equinox of the 1631 of the Chri&s;tian Aera, and took the rout of Dowlatab&acirc;d.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">armies from the Imperial camp.</NOTE>The emperor, in the mean time, remained at Brampour. Forces from various quarters crowded daily into his camp. He detach|ed &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e, under Raw Ruton, toward Tellingana;  and as many more, under the conduct of Abul Hu&s;&s;ein, into the principality of Na&s;ic, in the mountains of Ballagat. The Raja of Na&s;ic had in&s;ulted Shaw Jeh&acirc;n in his exile and misfortunes; nor did he ever forget an injury which affected his pride. The Hindoo prince &s;uffered for his in&s;olence; his country being, without mercy, &s;ubjected to fire and &s;word. The emperor told Hu&s;&s;ein at parting: <Q REND="inline">"The Raja of Na&s;ic li&s;tened not to me in my di&s;tre&s;s; and you mu&s;t teach him how dangerous it is to in|&s;ult a man, that may one day be &s;overeign of the world."</Q> The expre&s;&s;ion alluded to his own name; but a je&s;t was unfit for the tragedy which was acted in the de&s;olated country of Na&s;ic.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Succe&s;s in Golconda.</NOTE>The fir&s;t account of the &s;ucce&s;s of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n's arms arrived at Brampour, from Bak&icirc;r the governor of Ori&s;&s;a. That province  lying contiguous to Golconda, Bak&icirc;r had received orders to make a diver&s;ion on that &s;ide. He accordingly had marched with a con&s;iderable force; and found the &s;ide of the country neare&s;t to Ori&s;&s;a uncovered with troops. He laid &s;iege to Shud|da, Shikeri&s;t, Chizduar and Berimal, places of great &s;trength in Golconda; and they fell &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into his hands. The news of this &s;ucce&s;s plea&s;ed the more the le&s;s it was expected. In the &s;plendour of the other expeditions, that under Bak&icirc;r was forgotten; and the emperor &s;carce remembered that he had given orders to the Suba to invade the enemy, when he heard that he had pene|trated into the heart of their country. Honours were heaped upon him; and his me&s;&s;engers were loaded with pre&s;ents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lodi com|mands the con&s;ederates.</NOTE>Though Lodi had failed in bringing the united force of the confederates into the field, he led the councils of the

courts of Golconda and Bijapour. By repre&s;enting to them, that when they fought one by one all &s;hould be overcome, they &s;ub|mitted their armies to his command. He advanced immedi|ately toward the Imperiali&s;ts, and threw him&s;elf into the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains before Eradit, who made many vain efforts to penetrate into Golconda. A reinforcement of nine thou&s;and men were detached to him from the Imperial camp. Nothing would do. His &s;ituation and abilities enabled Lodi to counteract all his mo|tions; and he either remained inactive, or lo&s;t numbers in fruitle&s;s attempts. An army, which penetrated from Guzerat into the coun|tries on the coa&s;t of Malabar, was not &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;trong fortre&s;s of Chandwar fell into their hands; and they &s;pread their deva&s;tations far and wide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs at court.</NOTE>Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was not in the mean time idle at Brampour. Though he directed all the motions of the armies, he was not forgetful  of the civil government of his va&s;t empire. With a ju&s;tice which bordered on &s;everity, he qua&s;hed all petty di&s;turbances through his dominions. He inquired minutely into every de|partment. He heard all complaints again&s;t his own officers; and when the people were aggrieved, he removed them from their employments. Nor was he, in the mid&s;t of public bu&s;ine&s;s, ne|gligent of that grandeur and magnificence which, by rai&s;ing awe in his &s;ubjects, gave weight to his commands. He &s;elected a hundred out of the &s;ons of the nobility, who were of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and created them Omrahs in one day. He gave to each a golden mace, and they were, by their in&s;titution, always to attend the pre&s;ence. They were all uniformly dre&s;&s;ed in embroidered cloaths, with golden helmets, &s;words inlaid, and &s;hields &s;tudded with gold. When the emperor rode abroad, the&s;e attended him, with drawn &s;abres, all mounted on fine Arabian hor&s;es. Out of the&s;e he cho&s;e his officers; and when he &s;ent any

of them on &s;ervice, his place was immediately &s;upplied from another corps who, though not dignified with titles, were equipped in the &s;ame manner, only that their ornaments were of &s;ilver. They al&s;o attended the emperor on hor&s;eback, when he rode abroad.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An action.</NOTE>Eradit, having de&s;paired of being able to force the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains where Lodi was po&s;ted with the army of the confe|derates,  directed his march another way. He was clo&s;e pur&s;ued by Lodi with twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e. That general, finding a proper opportunity, attacked the Imperiali&s;ts with great vigour, threw them into confu&s;ion, and went near routing the whole army. Six Omrahs of rank fell on the Imperial &s;ide; but Era|dit having formed his army in order of battle, Lodi thought proper to give way, and to &s;helter him&s;elf in the hills. Eradit took advantage of his retreat, and hung clo&s;e upon his heels:&mdash;but Lodi had the addre&s;s not to offer battle, excepting upon un|equal terms on the &s;ide of the enemy. He in the mean time ha|ra&s;&s;ed the Imperial army with flying &s;quadrons; cutting off their convoys, defeating their foraging parties, and laying wa&s;te the country in their rear. Nor was the expedition under Raw Ru|ton into Tellingana attended with more &s;ucce&s;s than that under Eradit. The general was inactive, and the army weak. Raw Ruton was recalled, and di&s;graced for his inactivity; and Nazir Chan took the command of the Imperial troops in Tellingana.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;gans re|pul&s;ed.</NOTE>The active &s;pirit of Lodi was not con&s;ined to the operations of the &s;ield.

They were led by Kemnal, the chief of the Rohilla tribe; and they entered Punj&acirc;b, with a numerous but irregular army. The

He contented him&s;elf with &s;ending orders to the governors of the adjacent provinces to repel the invaders. The Afgans accordingly were oppo&s;ed, defeated, and driven with little lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the empire, to &s;helter them&s;elves in their native hills. The project of Lodi, though well planned, fell &s;hort of the intended effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eradir &s;uper|&s;eded in the command of the army.</NOTE>The &s;low progre&s;s made by Eradit, again&s;t the conduct and  abilities of Lodi, induced the emperor to think of &s;uper&s;ed|ing him in his command. He had promi&s;ed to him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;s, from the great &s;uperiority of his army in point of numbers, and the di&s;appointment fell heavy on his ambition and pride. To place him&s;elf at the head of the expedition, was beneath his dig|nity; and his pre&s;ence was otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary at Brampour, as the place mo&s;t centrical for conveying his orders to the different armies in the field. Be&s;ides, the civil bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, the &s;olid regulation of which he had much at heart, required his at|tention and application.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vi&s;ier takes the command of the army.</NOTE>THE vi&s;ier, in obedience to the emperor's orders, &s;et out from Brampour on the nineteenth of November, with a &s;plendid retinue, together with a reinforcement of ten thou|&s;and  hor&s;e. He took the command of the army upon his arrival in the mountains, and Eradit remained as his lieutenant; the emperor di&s;tru&s;ting more the abilities than the courage and fidelity of that Omrah. The name of A&s;iph, at the head of the army, &s;truck the confederates with a panic. They were no &s;trangers to his fame; and they began to be conquered in their own minds. They re&s;olved to retreat from their advantageous po&s;t. Lodi re|mon&s;trated in vain. They had taken their re&s;olution, and would not hear him. His haughty &s;pirit was di&s;gu&s;ted at their cowar|dice. Several nobles, formerly his friends, had joined him in his misfortunes, with their retinues. They adhered to his opi|nion, and re&s;olved to &s;tand by his &s;ide. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of advantageous ground; and they engaged the vi&s;ier with great re&s;olution and conduct. The battle was long equal: num|bers at la&s;t prevailed. Lodi and his brave friend Diria Chan
<PB N="137" REF="300">
covered the retreat of their party, whil&s;t they them&s;elves &s;lowly retired. The &s;ield of action and the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains re|mained to the vi&s;ier, who immediately detached a great part of the army under his lieutenant Eradit to Dowlatab&acirc;d.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nizam propo&s;es terms.</NOTE>The Nizam, being advanced in years, was unfit for the fatigues  of the field. He had remained in his capital; but as &s;oon as he heard of the approach of Eradit, he evacuated the city, and &s;hut him&s;elf up in the citadel, which was thought impregnable. Lodi, after his defeat, made the be&s;t of his way to Dowlatab&acirc;d, with an intention of throwing him&s;elf into that capital, to defend it to the la&s;t extremity. He was too late by &s;ome hours: Eradit was in the city. He fled, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;s near Dowlatab&acirc;d, where he defended him&s;elf till night, again&s;t the whole force of the Imperiali&s;ts. He e&s;caped in the dark, and wandered over Golconda. The army of the Nizam had, by this time, thrown them&s;elves into the fortre&s;&s;es, and the open country was over-run by the enemy. To complete the misfortunes of that prince, his nobles daily de&s;erted him, with their adherents, and joined Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. He began &s;eriou&s;ly to think of peace, and di&s;patched am|ba&s;&s;adors both to the emperor and to the vi&s;ier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flight,</NOTE>The emperor had given in&s;tructions to A&s;iph to li&s;ten to no terms, without a preliminary article, that Lodi &s;hould be deliver|ed  into his hands. The affairs of the Nizam were de&s;perate; and Lodi was afraid that nece&s;&s;ity would get the better of friend|&s;hip. He now con&s;idered his allies as his greate&s;t enemies, and he re&s;olved to fly from Golconda. The emperor had fore&s;een what was to happen, and he placed &s;trong detachments in all the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains. Notwith&s;tanding this precaution, in &s;pite of the general orders for &s;eizing him di&s;per&s;ed over the country, Lodi forced his way, with four hundred men, into
<PB N="138" REF="301">
Malava, and arrived at the city of Ugein. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of his e&s;cape, than he &s;ent Abdalla in pur&s;uit of him with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e. Abdalla came up with the fugitive at Ugein, but he e&s;caped to Debalpour; and being al&s;o driven from that place, he &s;urpri&s;ed Sirong, where he &s;eized &s;everal Im|perial elephants; and with the&s;e he took the route of Bundela.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">misfortunes,</NOTE>Misfortune pur&s;ued Lodi wherever he went. The Raja's &s;on, to gain the emperor's favour, fell upon him. In the action he  lo&s;t many of his be&s;t friends. Deria was the fir&s;t who fell; and the unfortunate Lodi gave up his &s;oul to grief. He fled; but it was to accumulated mi&s;ery. He fell in, the very next day, with the army of Abdalla: there &s;carce was time for flight. His eld|e&s;t &s;on, Mahommed Az&icirc;z, &s;topt, with a few friends, in a narrow part of the road; and devoting their lives for the &s;afety of Lodi, were cut off to a man. He waited half the night on a neigh|bouring hill, with a vain expectation of the return of his gallant &s;on. All was &s;ilent; and the unhappy father was di&s;&s;olved in tears. The noi&s;e of arms approached at la&s;t; but it was the enemy, re|cent from the &s;laughter of his &s;on and his friends. He fled to|ward Callenger; but Seid Amud, the governor of that place, marched out again&s;t him. A &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued: Lodi was defeat|ed; Hu&s;&s;ein, the only &s;on left to him, was &s;lain, and his adherents were now reduced to thirty hor&s;emen. He was pur&s;ued with &s;uch vehemence, that he had not even time for de&s;pair.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2nd death of Lodi;</NOTE>Abdalla, hearing of the low ebb of Lodi's fortune, divided his army into &s;mall parties, to &s;cour the country.

It is&mdash;that you leave me&mdash;and &s;ave your&s;elves by flight."</Q> They bur&s;t all into tears, and told him, that was the only command from him which they could not obey. He was &s;ilent, and gave the &s;ignal with his &s;word to advance. Muziffer was a&s;toni&s;hed when he &s;aw thirty men marching up again&s;t his numerous de|tachment. He imagined they were coming to &s;urrender them|&s;elves. But when they had come near his line, they put their hor&s;es on a gallop, and Muziffer ordered his men to fire. A ball pierced Lodi through the left brea&s;t; he fell dead at the feet of his hor&s;e, and his thirty faithful companions were cut off to a man.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE>Such was the end of Chan Jeh&acirc;n Lodi, after a &s;eries of uncommon  misfortunes. He was de&s;cended of the Imperial family of Lodi, who held the &s;ceptre of India before the Moguls. His mind was as high as his de&s;cent: his courage was equal to his ambition. He was full of honour, and generous in the extreme. His pride pre|vented him from ever gaining an enemy, and he never lo&s;t a friend. The attachment of his followers to his per&s;on, is the be&s;t eulogy on the benevolence of his mind; and the fears of the em|peror are irrefragable proofs of his abilities. Tho&s;e misfortunes, therefore, which might have excited pity had they fallen upon others, drew admiration only on Lodi. We feel compa&s;&s;ion for the weak; great men are a match for adver&s;ity: the conte&s;t is equal, and we yield to no emotion but &s;urprize.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negociation broke off.</NOTE>When the news of the death of Lodi arrived in the Imperial  camp, Shaw Jeh&acirc;n betrayed every &s;ymptom of joy. The head of

the unfortunate rebel was placed above one of the gates of the city of Brampour. Abdalla was care&s;&s;ed for his &s;ervices. Valu|able pre&s;ents were given him, and he was dignified with the &s;plen|did title of, THE SUN OF OMRAHS, AND THE VICTORIOUS IN WAR. Muziffer, who&s;e fortune it was to kill Lodi, was rai&s;ed to the dignity of the decea&s;ed, being afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Chan Jeh&acirc;n. The negociations for the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of peace between the emperor and the confederate princes of the Decan, was, in the mean time, broke off by the too great ne|mands on the part of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. Ho&s;tilities were accordingly recommenced, and Eradit was left in the command of the army; the public bu&s;ine&s;s demanding the pre&s;ence of the vi&s;ier at court. The confederates had, as has been already ob&s;erved, retired from the field into their &s;trong holds. The war was converted into a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ieges. The fortre&s;&s;es were &s;trong, the garri&s;ons de|termined, and the Imperiali&s;ts un&s;kilful; but the emperor was ob|&s;tinate, and would not abate from his fir&s;t demands. The con&s;e|quence was, that Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, after a war of two years, in which he lo&s;t multitudes of men by famine, di&s;ea&s;e, and the &s;word; and after having expended prodigious trea&s;ures, found him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of a few forts, his army tired out with ineffectual ho&s;tilities, and the enemy di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but not vanqui&s;hed.</P>

She had been twenty years married to Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, and bore him a child al|mo&s;t every year. Four &s;ons and four daughters &s;urvived her. When her hu&s;band a&s;cended the throne, he dignified her with the title of Mumt&acirc;za Zem&acirc;ni, or, THE MOST EXALTED OF THE AGE. Though &s;he &s;eldom interfered in public affairs, Shaw Jeh&acirc;n owed the empire to her influence with her father. Nor was he ungrateful: he loved her living, and lamented her when dead. Calm, engaging, and mild in her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he engro&s;&s;ed his whole affection: and though he maintained a number of women for &s;tate, they were only the &s;laves of her plea&s;ure. She was &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;t in Dei&s;m, that &s;he &s;carce could forbear per&s;ecuting the Portugue&s;e for their &s;uppo&s;ed idolatry; and it was only on what concerned that nation, &s;he &s;uffered her temper, which was naturally placid, to be ruffled. To expre&s;s his re&s;pect for her memory, the emperor rai&s;ed at Agra, a tomb to her name, which co&s;t in building the amazing &s;um of &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Public cala|mities.</NOTE>The death of the Sultana was followed by public calamities of  various kinds. The war in the Decan produced nothing but the de&s;olation of that country. An extraordinary drought, which burnt up all vegetables, dried up the rivers, and rent the very ground, occa&s;ioned a dreadful famine. The Imperial camp could not be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions: di&s;tre&s;s prevailed over the whole face of the empire. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n remitted the taxes in many of the provinces, to the amount of three millions &s;terling; he even

The &s;carcity of provi&s;ions prevailed in Per&s;ia: the famine raged with &s;till greater violence in the We&s;tern Tartary. No rain had fallen for &s;even years in that country. Populous and &s;louri&s;hing provinces were converted into &s;olitudes and de|&s;arts; and a few, who e&s;caped the general calamity, wandered through depopulated cities alone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The confe|derates &s;ue for peace.</NOTE>But as if famine and di&s;ea&s;e were not &s;ufficient to de&s;troy  mankind, A&s;iph J&acirc;h, who had re&s;umed the command of the army, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with the &s;word. He trod down the &s;canty harve&s;t in the Decan; and ravaged with fire and &s;word the king|dom of Bijapour. Adil Shaw, the &s;overeign of the country, came into terms when nothing was left worthy of defence. He pro|mi&s;ed to pay an annual tribute to the hou&s;e of Timur, and to own him&s;elf a dependent on the empire. Money was extorted from the Nizam, and from Kuttub, prince of Tellingana. The conditions were, That the emperor &s;hould remove his army; but that he &s;hould retain, by way of &s;ecurity for their future beha|viour, the &s;trong-holds which had fallen into his hands.

He, however, did not long continue to execute the duties of a commi&s;&s;ion which was the greate&s;t the emperor could be&s;tow. The command of the army, &s;tationed on the fron|tiers of the Decan, had been annexed to the &s;uba&s;hip of the pro|vince; and though Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was in no great terror of Era|dit's abilities, he, at that time, placed no tru&s;t in his fidelity.

He came into a fore&s;t, and finding a plea&s;ant plain in the middle, he re&s;olved to halt; dreaming of no danger in the center of an  impervious wood. Both he and his followers alighted, and tying their hor&s;es to trees, betook them&s;elves to re&s;t. A barbarous race of men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the country round. They had not &s;een the Raja's troop, but the neighing of his hor&s;es led &s;ome of them to the &s;pot.

The temptation was too great to be with&s;tood by men who had never &s;een &s;o much wealth before. They ru&s;hed upon the &s;trangers; and &s;tabbed them in their &s;leep. While they were yet dividing the &s;poil, Nu&s;erit came.

His active genius could not remain idle long. Di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of his predece&s;&s;or Eradit, who had carried on the late un&s;ucce&s;sful war in the Decan, he found means of renewing ho&s;tilities with the Niz&acirc;m.

The delivery of the Niz&acirc;m into the hands of the Imperial general, was one of the conditions impo&s;ed on Fatt&egrave; for the bribe which he received. The prince was carried to Agra. He was treated with apparent re&s;pect and kindne&s;s by the emperor; but it was danger|ous to permit him to remain at large.

He delighted to encourage him in the martial exerci&s;es, which the prince ardently loved; and though he did not abate in his regard for his other &s;ons, they repined at the preference given to Aurungz&ecirc;be. A feat which that prince performed on his birth-day, when he entered his fifteenth year, &s;trengthened his

intere&s;t in his father's affections. He fought on hor&s;eback again&s;t an elephant, in the pre&s;ence of the emperor and the whole court; and by his dexterity killed that enormous animal. The whole empire rung with his prai&s;e; and the action was celebrated in ver&s;e by Saib Selim, the be&s;t poet of the age. The prince Suja, naturally high-&s;pirited and jealous, &s;hewed violent &s;igns of di&s;|content at the preference given to Aurungz&ecirc;be. He began to look upon his younger brother as de&s;igned for the throne; and his haughty mind could not endure the thought. He wi&s;hed to be ab&s;ent from a &s;cene which gave him unea&s;ine&s;s; and he prevailed on Moh&acirc;bet to write to the emperor, reque&s;ting that he &s;hould be &s;ent to him to the Decan.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealou&s;y of Dara.</NOTE>Dara, the Imperial prince, highly re&s;ented the honours con|ferred  on Suja.

He complained to his father with great vehemence; and the latter endeavoured to &s;ooth his &s;on, by in&s;inuating, that from his great affection for him, he could not permit him to take the field; and that, in the palace, there was no need of the parade of a military command. Dara would not be &s;atisfied with the&s;e rea&s;ons; and the emperor, to make him ea&s;y, gave him the command of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e. The prince, however, could not forget the prior honours of Suja. He was told that Moh&acirc;bet de&s;igned that prince for the throne; and there were &s;ome grounds for &s;u&s;picion on that head. Had Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had a &s;erious de&s;ign of favouring Suja, he could not have fallen upon more effectual means of &s;erving him, than by placing him under the tuition of &s;o able an officer as Moh&acirc;bet.

Jehan|gire owed twice to him his throne; once to his valour, and once to his moderation; and his name gave the empire to Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, more than the friend&s;hip of A&s;iph J&acirc;h.</P>

It was afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Tuckt Ta&ocirc;us, or the Peacock Throne, from having the figures of two peacocks &s;tand|ing behind it with their tails &s;pread, which were &s;tudded with jewels of various colours to repre&s;ent the life. Between the peacocks &s;tood a parrot of the ordinary &s;ize, cut out of one emerald. The fine&s;t jewel in the throne was a ruby, which had fallen into the hands of Timur when he plundered Delhi in the year 1398. Jehangire, with peculiar barbarity, dimini&s;hed the beauty and lu&s;tre of the &s;tone, by engraving upon it his own name and titles; and when he was reproved for this piece of vanity by the fa|vourite Sultana, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"This &s;tone will perhaps carry my name down further through time, than the empire of the hou&s;e of Timur."</Q></P>

<P><MILESTONE N="1636" UNIT="A.D."><MILESTONE N="1046" UNIT="Hig."><NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor re&s;olves to in|vade the De|can.</NOTE>SHAW JEHAN, whether mo&s;t prompted by avarice or by ambition is uncertain, formed a re&s;olution to reduce the Ma|hommedan &s;overeignties of the Decan into provinces of the Mo|gul  empire. The conque&s;ts made by his generals were partial. They had laid wa&s;te, but had not &s;ubdued the country; and when mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, they impo&s;ed contributions rather than a tribute on the enemy. Even the great abilities of Moh&acirc;bet were not attend|ed with a &s;ucce&s;s equal to the &s;anguine hopes of the emperor; and all his pro&s;pects of conque&s;t vani&s;hed at the death of that able ge|neral. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, though addicted to the enervating plea&s;ures of the haram, was rouzed by his ambition to mark his reign with &s;ome &s;plendid conque&s;t; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For it is not enough," he &s;aid, "for a great prince to &s;end only to his po&s;terity the dominions which he has received from his fathers."</Q> The thought was more
<PB N="157" REF="322">
magnificent than wi&s;e. To improve the conque&s;ts of his fathers with true policy, would be more u&s;eful to his po&s;terity, and more glorious to him&s;elf, than to exhau&s;t his &s;trength in violent efforts to extend the limits of his empire. He however had determined on the mea&s;ure; and the advice of his mo&s;t prudent Omrahs and coun&s;ellors was de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He &s;ets out from Agra.</NOTE>On the fir&s;t of October 1636, he &s;et out from Agra with his  u&s;ual pomp and magnificence. Dowlatab&acirc;d was the point to which he directed his march; but his progre&s;s was politically &s;low. He had given orders to the governors of the provinces to join him with their forces as he advanced; and the di&s;tance of many of them from the intended &s;cene of action, required time to bring them to the field. The prince Aurungz&ecirc;be attended his father on this expedition, and was highly in favour. He propo&s;ed, with a youthful ardor which plea&s;ed the emperor, to take a circuit with the Imperial camp, through the province of Bundela, to view the &s;trong holds which he him&s;elf, under the tuition of Nu&s;erit, had &s;ome time before taken from the unfortunate Judger Singh. The emperor had not as yet collected a force &s;ufficient to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to his arms; and to gain time, he li&s;tened to the reque&s;t of his &s;on. The whole of the year was pa&s;&s;ed in preme|ditated delays, and in excur&s;ions of hunting; &s;o that the emperor did not arrive in the Decan till the latter end of the rainy &s;ea&s;on of the 1637 of the Chri&s;tian aera.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He lays wa&s;te the enemy's country.</NOTE>The Subas of the different provinces had, with their troops,  joined the emperor on his march. His force was prodigious when he entered the borders of the enemy. On his arrival at Dowlata|b&acirc;d, he was able to form twelve different armies, which, under twelve leaders, he &s;ent into the kingdoms of Bijapour and Tellin|gana. The princes of the country had collected their forces, but
<PB N="158" REF="323">
<MILESTONE N="1638" UNIT="A.D."><MILESTONE N="1048" UNIT="Hig.">
they knew not to which quarter they &s;hould direct their march. The Imperiali&s;ts formed a circle round them, and war was at once in all parts of their dominions. The orders of the emperor were barbarous and cruel. He &s;ubmitted the open country to fire; and garri&s;ons that re&s;i&s;ted were put to the &s;word. <Q REND="inline">"War is an evil," he &s;aid; "and compa&s;&s;ion contributes only to render that evil per|manent."</Q> The ea&s;tern writers de&s;cribe the mi&s;eries of the De|can in the peculiar hyperboles of their diction. <Q REND="inline">"Towns and cities," &s;ay they, "were &s;een in flames on every &s;ide; the hills were &s;haken with the continual roar of artillery, and tigers and the wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert &s;led from the rage of men."</Q> One hundred and fifteen towns and ca&s;tles were taken and de&s;troyed in the cour&s;e of the year. The emperor &s;ate, in the mean time, aloft in the citadel of Dowlatab&acirc;d, and looked down, with horrid joy, on the tempe&s;t which he him&s;elf had rai&s;ed around.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">which &s;ub|mits.</NOTE>The deva&s;tations committed by the expre&s;s orders of the empe|ror, had at la&s;t the intended effect on the &s;overeigns of Tellingana  and Bijapour. Shut up in their &s;tronge&s;t forts, they could not a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;ubjects, who were either ruined or ma&s;&s;acred without mercy around them. They propo&s;ed peace in the mo&s;t humble and &s;upplicating terms. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n took advantage of their ne|ce&s;&s;ities, and impo&s;ed &s;evere conditions. They were e&s;tabli&s;hed, by commi&s;&s;ion from the emperor, as hereditary governors of their own dominlons, upon agreeing to give a large annual tribute, the fir&s;t payment of which was to be made at the &s;igning of the treaty. The princes be&s;ides were to acknowledge the emperor and his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors lords paramount of the Decan in all their public deeds, and to de&s;ign them&s;elves, The humble &s;ubjects of the empire of the Moguls.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emperor re|turns to Aj|mere.</NOTE>The treaty being &s;igned and ratified, the emperor left his &s;on Aurungz&ecirc;be under the tuition of Chan Zim&acirc;n, the &s;on of Moh&acirc;bet, 
<PB N="159" REF="324">
at the head of a con&s;iderable force, to awe his new &s;ubjects. In the &s;trong holds which had fallen into his hands during the war, he placed garri&s;ons; and, having left the Decan, took the route of Ajmere. On the eighth of December 1638, he arrived in that city, and vi&s;ited the &s;hrine of Moin ul Dien, more from a de&s;ire to plea&s;e the &s;uper&s;titious among his courtiers, than from his own devotion. He had not remained long at Ajmere when the prince Aurungz&ecirc;be arrived, to celebrate his nuptials with the daughter of Shaw Naw&acirc;z, the &s;on of A&s;iph J&agrave;h. The vi&s;ier, who had remain|ed during the war at Agra, to manage the civil affairs of the em|pire, came to join the court at Ajmere, accompanied by Mor&acirc;d, the emperor's younge&s;t &s;on, and was pre&s;ent at the &s;plendid fe&s;tival held in honour of the marriage of his grand&s;on with his grand|daughter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Chan Zim&acirc;n.</NOTE>Soon after the departure of Aurungz&ecirc;be from the army in  the Decan, Chan Zim&acirc;n, fell &s;ick and died. His death was much regretted by the whole empire. Calm, manly and ge|nerous, he was e&s;teemed, re&s;pected, and beloved. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the polite accompli&s;hments of the gentleman: he was a brave general, a good &s;tate&s;man, an excellent &s;cholar, and a poet. Under his original name of Mirza Amani, he pub|li&s;hed a collection of his poems, which are &s;till in high repute for their energy and elegance over all the Ea&s;t. The emperor was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the high merit of Chan Zim&acirc;n, that he &s;incerely la|mented his death, and &s;poke much in his prai&s;e in the hall of the pre&s;ence, before the whole nobility. <Q REND="inline">"We did not mi&s;s," &s;aid he, "the abilities of Moh&acirc;bet, till we lo&s;t his &s;on."</Q> Aurungz&ecirc;be re|ceived immediate orders to repair to the Decan, and to take upon him&s;elf the &s;ole command of the Imperial army, &s;tationed in the conquered provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="325">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection in Beh&acirc;r.</NOTE>During the&s;e tran&s;actions in Ajmere, the revolt of the Raja of Budgepour happened in the province of Beh&acirc;r. The emperor de|tached a part of the army under Abdalla to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;urrec|tion.  Abdalla at the &s;ame time received a commi&s;&s;ion to govern Beh&acirc;r in quality of Suba. He attacked and defeated the Raja on his fir&s;t arrival; and that unfortunate prince, who&s;e love of inde|pendence had made him overlook his own want of power, was re|duced to the la&s;t extremity. He &s;hut him&s;elf up in a fortre&s;s which was inve&s;ted on all &s;ides. When a breach was made in the walls, and the orders for the a&s;&s;ault were i&s;&s;ued, the Raja came out of his ca&s;tle, leading his children in his hand. He might have been pardoned; but his wife appearing behind him, &s;ealed his doom. She was extremely hand&s;ome, and Abdalla, though old him&s;elf, wi&s;hed to grace his haram with a beautiful widow. The unfortunate Raja, therefore, was put to death on the &s;pot as a re|bel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Candah&acirc;r de|livered up to the empire.</NOTE>The news of the defeat and death of the Raja of Budgepour had  &s;carce arrived at court, when Shaw Jeh&acirc;n received an agreeable piece of intelligence from the northern frontier of the empire. The feeble admini&s;tration of Sefi, who &s;ucceeded Shaw Abas in the throne of Per&s;ia, had thrown the affairs of that kingdom into confu&s;ion. Ali Murdan commanded in the fortre&s;s of Can|dah&acirc;r. His fidelity was &s;u&s;pected; and, be&s;ides, he &s;aw no end of the troubles which di&s;tracted his country. He re&s;olved to &s;ave him&s;elf from the malice of his enemies, by delivering the city to the emperor of Hindo&s;tan, from who&s;e hands it had been wre&s;ted by Shaw Abas. A negociation was therefore &s;et on foot by Ali Murdan with Seid Chan, the governor of Cabul. His terms were only for him&s;elf. Seid clo&s;ed with him in the name of his &s;ove|reign. He &s;ent his &s;on in ha&s;te with a force to Candah&acirc;r, which
<PB N="161" REF="326">
was delivered by Ali Murdan, who &s;et out immediately to pay his re&s;pects to his new &s;overeign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;ian de|feated.</NOTE>Sefi no &s;ooner heard of the treachery of Ali Murdan, than  he i&s;&s;ued orders for a force to march from Chora&s;&s;an to retake Candah&acirc;r. This expedition was under the conduct of Sc&acirc;h&ocirc;&s;h. That officer appeared before the city with &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e; but Seid, who commanded in the place, &s;allied out with an inferior force, and totally defeated the Per&s;ians, for which &s;ig|nal &s;ervice he was rai&s;ed, by the name of Ziffer Jung, to the dignity of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e. Gulz&acirc;r, the governor of Moul|tan, was removed to Candah&acirc;r; and as a general war with Per&s;ia was apprehended, the prince Suja was di&s;patched with a great army to the province of Cabul. Before Gulz&acirc;r arrived at his new government, Seid following his victory over the Per|&s;ians, penetrated into Sei&s;t&acirc;n. Bu&s;t, Zemind&acirc;wir, and other places fell into his hands; and all the di&s;trict which had formerly been annexed to the government of Candah&acirc;r, was reduced to &s;ubjection by his arms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ali Murdan rewarded.</NOTE>The emperor was &s;o overjoyed at the recovery of Candah&acirc;r,  that he received Ali Murdan with every mark of e&s;teem and gratitude. He was rai&s;ed to the rank of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e, with the title of captain-general of the Imperial forces, and inve&s;t|ed with the government of Ca&s;hmire. The &s;ervice he had done was great, but the reward of treachery was extravagant. Ali, however, &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities equal to any rank. Bold, pro|vident and ambitious, he gra&s;ped at power; and when he had ob|tained it, he kept it during his life by management and intrigue. His genero&s;ity rendered him popular; and before his death he is &s;aid to have numbered &s;ixteen thou&s;and families of Afgans, U&s;becs, and Moguls among his clients and dependants.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="327">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion from A&s;&s;am.</NOTE>The mo&s;t remarkable tran&s;action of the year 1638, next to the recovery of Candah&acirc;r, was an inva&s;ion of the province of Bengal by the Tartars of A&s;&s;&acirc;m. They ru&s;hed down the river Birram|puta  in armed boats, to where it falls into the Ganges, below Dacca. They plundered &s;ome of the northern di&s;tricts, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;everal &s;mall forts. I&s;lam, governor of Ben|gal, hearing of the inva&s;ion, marched again&s;t the enemy with all the Imperial troops &s;tationed in the province. They had the folly to come to action with the Suba, and he gave them a &s;ignal defeat. Four thou&s;and were killed on the &s;pot, and five hundred armed ve&s;&s;els fell into the hands of the conqueror. The remaining part of the invaders fled; and the governor pur&s;ued them into their own coun|try. Fifteen forts, with the king of A&s;&s;am's &s;on-in-law, fell into his hands. The whole province of Coch&acirc;gi was reduced; and he invaded that of Buldive. The latter was very ob&s;tinately defend|ed. Few pa&s;&s;es led into it, being environed with mountains. The Suba at la&s;t forced the pa&s;&s;es, and the enemy fled to the hills.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduction of A&s;&s;am.</NOTE>The &s;overeign of Buldive did not long &s;urvive the reduction of  his country. Worn out with fatigue, hara&s;&s;ed with grief, and tormented with vexation, he was &s;eized with a contagious di&s;tem|per, which infected his family, and carried him and them off in a few days. His people, however, would not quit their hills. The enemy &s;pread deva&s;tation over the plain below; and the unfortu|nate A&s;&s;&acirc;mites beheld from the woods, the &s;moke of their burning towns. But the unbounded ravages of Iflam occa&s;ioned his re|treat. The grain was inadvertently de&s;troyed in the fire which con&s;umed the towns of Buldive, and a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions began to be felt in the Imperial camp. I&s;lam marched back with the &s;poils of A&s;&s;&acirc;m; but he &s;uffered incredible hard&s;hips from the bad|ne&s;s of the roads, the torrents which fell from the hills, and a di&s;|temper, which the rainy &s;ea&s;on, now come on, had rai&s;ed in the
<PB N="163" REF="328">
army. The kingdom of Tibet was, at the &s;ame time, reduced by Ziffer. The news of this double conque&s;t came at the &s;ame in&s;tant to the emperor. He was greatly plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, as none of the Mahommedan princes, who had reigned be|fore him in India, ever penetrated into tho&s;e countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Mah-Raja.</NOTE>The eleventh year of the reign of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n commenced with  the death of the Mah-Raja, prince of the Rajaputs. He was &s;ucceeded in the throne by his &s;econd &s;on Hu&s;&s;inet Singh; it be|ing the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of the branch of the Rajaputs called Mahrattors, to leave the &s;ceptre to the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;overeigns by their latter will. The Rajaputs, properly &s;o called, did not ac|quie&s;ce in the right of Hu&s;&s;inet. He had an elder brother, and they adhered to him. The flames of a civil war were kindied; but the emperor interfered; and, after having examined the claims of both the princes, he confirmed the Raja's will in favour of Hu&s;|&s;inet, whom he rai&s;ed to the rank of four thou&s;and hor&s;e. His elder brother, who was deprived of all hopes of the throne by the deci&s;ion of the emperor, was al&s;o created an Omrah of three thou|&s;and.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Per&s;ia.</NOTE>The in&s;ult which Per&s;ia received through the inva&s;ion of its ter|ritories by the Mogul governor of Candah&acirc;r, did not rai&s;e any  &s;pirit of revenge in the court of I&s;pahan. The debility in the coun|cils of Sefi brought on a peace between the empires. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had di&s;patched Sifder Chan his amba&s;&s;ador to the court of Per&s;ia. That lord returned this year from Serifa, where Sefi re&s;ided, with a pre&s;ent of five hundred hor&s;es, &s;ome curious animals, and va|rious manufactures of Per&s;ia, to the value of five lacks of roupees. Sifder executed his commi&s;&s;ion &s;o much to his ma&s;ter's &s;atisfac|tion, that he was rai&s;ed to the dignity of five thou&s;and hor&s;e. The chief condition of the treaty of peace between Perfia and

Hindo&s;tan was, an entire ce&s;&s;ion of Candah&acirc;r by the former in favour of the latter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Af|zil, the em|peror's pre|ceptor.</NOTE>The winter of the year 1637 had been remarkable for a great  fall of &s;now in the northern provinces of India. It extended as far as Lahore; and in the mountains of Cabul and Ca&s;hmire, many villages, with all their inhabitants, were overwhelmed and de|&s;troyed. The emperor, in the mean time, kept his court at La|hore. Peace being e&s;tabli&s;hed on every &s;ide, he applied him&s;elf to the management of the civil government of the empire. He i&s;&s;ued many &s;alutary edicts for the &s;ecurity of property, the improvement of the country, and the encouragement of commerce. In the mid&s;t of his cares for the good of the &s;tate, he was afflicted with the death of Afzil Chan, a man of great literary talents, who had been his preceptor. The young princes were al&s;o educated under his care, and they mourned him as a father. He had been rai&s;ed to the fir&s;t honours of the empire. He obtained the rank of &s;even thou&s;and, and the management of the civil affairs of the em|pire were in a great mea&s;ure in his hands. The emperor, to &s;how his great veneration for his abilities, allowed him an annual reve|nue of three hundred and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara and Suja promot|ed.</NOTE>Soon after the death of Afzil, the princes Dara and Suja were rai&s;ed to higher ranks of nobility. Dara was dignified with the  title of an Omrah of ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and ten thou&s;and foot; and Suja with the rank of &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e and as many of foot. The emperor having frequently declared his intentions of leaving the throne to Dara, gave him always the fir&s;t place in dig|nities and power. He &s;hewed an inclination of habituating his other &s;ons to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Dara; and whatever marks of &s;upe|rior affection he might be&s;tow on his younger &s;ons in private, in public he directed his principal attention to the elde&s;t.

was not at court when his brothers were promoted. Aver&s;e to idlene&s;s in his command of the army in the Decan, he made an incur&s;ion, under pretence of injuries, into the country of Bag|lana. The forts fell into his hands, and the chiefs &s;ubmitted to a tribute; but the &s;terility and poverty of tho&s;e regions did neither an&s;wer the expence of the war, nor that of keeping the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conquered country. He therefore evacuated the places which he had taken, and depended for the tribute on the future fears of the enemy. Having brought back the army within the limits of the empire, Aurungz&ecirc;be, who was jealous of the influence of Dara with the emperor, reque&s;ted leave of ab&s;ence, and came to Lahore, where his father at the time re&s;ided.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suja made governor of Bengal.</NOTE>The prince Suja, who had been &s;ent with an army to Cabul,  when a war with Per&s;ia was apprehended, had for &s;ome time re|mained in that city. His wife dying, he returned on the twenty|third of June 1638 to Lahore, where he was married with great pomp and &s;olemnity to the daughter of Azim. Complaints having been &s;ent to court again&s;t I&s;lam, governor of Bengal, he was removed from his office; and Suja was ordered to pro|ceed, with a commi&s;&s;ion, into that kingdom, to re&s;tore the civil re|gulations which had been ruined by the rapacity of I&s;lam. Ab|dalla, governor of Beh&acirc;r, had al&s;o fallen under the emperor's di&s;|plea&s;ure for &s;ome oppre&s;&s;ions which he had exerci&s;ed in the execu|tion of ju&s;tice. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, who was a &s;evere ju&s;ticiary, would not even have his repre&s;entatives in the provinces &s;u&s;pected of partiality in the di&s;tribution of the laws. He heard the com|plaints of the poore&s;t &s;ubjects, from the mo&s;t di&s;tant corners of the empire, and the influence of the fir&s;t men in the &s;tate was not &s;u&s;&s;i|cient to protect the delinquents from his re&s;entment. He was, therefore, beloved by the people, and reverenced and feared by the great. An Imperial order was i&s;&s;ued to Abdalla to appear in

under his father, he &s;ucceeded him in the office of vi&s;ier, and managed the affairs of the empire with great addre&s;s during the remaining part of the reign of Jehangire. The active part which he took to &s;ecure the empire for Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, met with every return of gratitude from that prince; who, &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion, rai&s;ed him to an office &s;uperior in dignity to that of vi&s;ier, called Vakiel Mutuluck, or ab&s;olute mini&s;ter of the empire.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He leaves his fortune to prince Dara.</NOTE>Though three &s;ons and five daughters &s;urvived the vi&s;ier, he adopted his grand&s;on Dara, the Imperial prince, and con&s;ti|tuted  him heir to all his fortune. He excu&s;ed him&s;elf to his &s;ons, by &s;aying, that he had already rai&s;ed them to high ranks and employments in the &s;tate; and that, if they conducted them&s;elves with prudence and wi&s;dom, the favour of the emperor would be to them an ample fortune. <Q REND="inline">"But, &s;hould Folly be the ruler of your conduct," continued A&s;iph, "you do not de&s;erve to po&s;&s;e&s;s the wealth which I have acquired by my &s;ervices."</Q> There was pru|dence in the conduct of A&s;iph upon this occa&s;ion. The emperor loved money; and he might have availed him&s;elf of the law, which con&s;titutes the prince the heir of all his officers; and a di&s;|pute of that kind might prove fatal to the influence and intere&s;t of the family of the vi&s;ier.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE>Though the abilities of A&s;iph J&acirc;h were little known under the  wi&s;e and able admini&s;tration of his father, they broke forth with lu&s;tre when he him&s;elf came into the fir&s;t office in the &s;tate. He was a great orator, a fine writer, an able politician. In his pri|vate character, he was mild, affable, humane, generous; in his public, &s;evere, re&s;erved, inflexible, exact. He never excu&s;ed ne|gligence; he puni&s;hed di&s;obedience. His orders, therefore, were no &s;ooner i&s;&s;ued than they were executed; his very nod was re|&s;pected, under&s;tood, and obeyed. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of political as well as per&s;onal courage; as little afraid of the unju&s;t reproaches of his friends, as he was of the weapons of his enemies; and he was often heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"That he who fears death is unworthy of life."</Q> He was uniform in his conduct, impartial and dignified in his actions, con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf. He courted not popula|rity by his mea&s;ures: ju&s;tice, propriety, and the ultimate good of the &s;tate, and not the applau&s;e of the vulgar, were his objects in all his deci&s;ions. He was fit for the field, as well as adapted for the cabinet; and had he not gained renown with the pen, he would have commanded it with the &s;word. In his youth, he was addicted to poetry. He wrote upon heroic &s;ubjects; and the fire of his genius was &s;uch, that the very &s;ound of his ver&s;e animates the &s;oul to war. The glory and happine&s;s of India during his long admini&s;tration were great; and when war raged on the frontiers, the interior provinces enjoyed uninterrupted peace. The field in which he moved was exten&s;ive, but his eye comprehended the whole. An ea&s;tern writer continues the metaphor, and &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That he rendered that field flouri&s;hing and fruitful. He pa&s;&s;ed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;ons.</NOTE>The original name of the elde&s;t &s;on of A&s;iph was Mirza Mor&acirc;d.  He was dignified afterwards with the title of Shai&s;ta Chan; and he was governor of Beh&acirc;r at the death of his father. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed not the abilities of his family; being of an infirm and &s;ickly con&s;titution, with a delicate, rather than a vigorous and active mind. Mirza Mi&s;ti, the &s;econd &s;on of A&s;iph, was a youth of great hopes; vigorous, active, and full of fire. He lo&s;t his life in a drunken frolic; for being one day at the river Beh&acirc;t in Ca&s;h|mire, when it foamed over its banks, he &s;purred his hor&s;e into the &s;tream, by way of bravado, and, for his temerity, was drowned. Mirza Hu&s;&s;ein, the third &s;on of the vi&s;ier, was a man of moderate abilities; and his fourth &s;on, who had been digni|fied with the title of Shaw Naw&acirc;z, was a nobleman of great reputation and high di&s;tinction in the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ju&s;tice of the emperor.</NOTE>The emperor, jealous of the influence which the governors of  the provinces might acquire by a long continuance in their offices, made a practice of removing them every third year. When the news of any oppre&s;&s;ion committed by them arrived at court, they were in&s;tantly &s;uper&s;eded; and, upon examination, if found guilty, dive&s;ted of all their honours, and confined. The puni&s;hment of death &s;eemed to have been laid a&s;ide from the com|mencement of this regin. Tirbiet Chan was, this year, ordered back from the government of Cabul, for his &s;everity in exacting the revenue from the poor. The emperor him&s;elf had been a witne&s;s of the mi&s;erable condition to which the people of that pro|vince were reduced, by the floods in the rivers Cho&s;hal and Beh&acirc;t; and they had not yet recovered from that grievous calamity.

His intentions again&s;t Ali Murdan lo&s;t him the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Candah&acirc;r, and he took no mea&s;ures to revenge the in&s;ults which he received on his fron|tiers, after that place had fallen into the hands of the Moguls. The tumults of the Per&s;ians were at length quelled in their blood; and Sefi, having de&s;troyed his dome&s;tic enemies, turned his atten|tion to his foreign foes.

the prince took the route of Cabul. Thirty thou&s;and men, &s;ta|tioned on the frontiers, flocked al&s;o to the &s;tandard of Dara, upon his arrival at Cabul.

But the&s;e formidable preparations were, in the event, unnece&s;&s;ary. Sefi, to the great joy of his &s;ubjects, fell &s;ick and died. The war, which was begun by him, was dropt, with his other mea&s;ures, by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.

Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, however, who&s;e attention to the affairs of the em|pire was always uppermo&s;t in his mind, thought Lahore too di&s;tant from the &s;outhern provinces; which, on account of their wealth, were the mo&s;t important divi&s;ion of his dominions. He therefore re&s;olved, as there was a pro&s;pect of permanent tranquillity on the northern frontier, to remove his court to Agra, where he ar|rived in the month of November. The cavalcade which attend|ed his progre&s;s, was magnificent and numerous beyond de&s;crip|tion. The armies returned from the north were in his train; and half the citizens of Lahore, who, from his long re&s;idence in that place, were become in a manner his dome&s;tics, accompanied him on his march. He pitched his tents in the gardens of his fa|vourite wife, Mumt&acirc;za Zem&acirc;n.

His affection, when they were young, prevented him from following the policy of other De&s;pots, by &s;hutting up every acce&s;s of know|ledge from their minds: and to keep them at court after they had commanded armies and provinces, would be a perpetual &s;ource of animofity between them, and of unea&s;ine&s;s to him&s;elf.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara's jea|lou&s;y of Au|rungzebe.</NOTE>THOUGH Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, by his great attention upon every occa&s;ion to Dara, had convinced his &s;ubjects of his de&s;ign to appoint him his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the throne, that prince was  jealous of the growing reputation of Aurungz&ecirc;be. The latter, in his frequent expeditions at the head of armies, found various opportunities of gaining friends, by the places of honour and profit which he had, by his commi&s;&s;ion, to be&s;tow; and he was not of a di&s;po&s;ition to relinqui&s;h by negligence, the influence which he had acquired by favours. Cool, &s;ubtle, and &s;elf-denied, he covered his actions with &s;uch an appearance of hone&s;t &s;incerity, that men imputed his attention to their own merit, and not to his de&s;igns. The penetrating eye of his father had pierced the veil which he had thrown over his ambition; but the implicit obe|dience which Aurungz&ecirc;be paid to all his commands flattered him into a kind of oblivion of his former ob&s;ervations on the duplicity of his character. Dara had carried his jealou&s;y of Aurungz&ecirc;be into a kind of aver&s;ion to his per&s;on. He envied him when &s;uc|ce&s;sful;
<PB N="199" REF="364">
and he triumphed over his misfortunes: but his exulta|tion was as &s;ecret as his hatred, as both proceeded from fear, a pa&s;&s;ion which his &s;oul di&s;dained to own.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His un&s;uc|ce&s;sful expe|dition again&s;t Candah&acirc;r.</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be having twice mi&s;carried in his attempts on Canda|h&acirc;r,  Dara wi&s;hed to gather laurels where his rival had fail|ed. He applied to his father for an army: in&s;inuating, that the bad &s;ucce&s;s which attended his brother, proceeded from his want of knowledge and conduct. A very large &s;um was i&s;&s;ued from the Imperial trea&s;ury; and the army and artil|lery in the provinces beyond the Indus were &s;ubmitted to the command of Dara. That prince inve&s;ted Candah&acirc;r. The &s;iege continued five months, without any impre&s;&s;ion being made. The &s;tores were at la&s;t exhau&s;ted, the troops were di&s;pirited, and Dara found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of retreating with lo&s;s of repu|putation. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was &s;ilent upon the occa&s;ion; and even Aurungz&ecirc;be, who triumphed in &s;ecret over Dara's di&s;appoint|ment, attributed, in his conver&s;ation, this fre&s;h mi&s;carriage to the &s;trength of the place, more than to his brother's want of abilities in war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is &s;o|lemnly ap|pointed &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to the emperor.</NOTE>The un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition to Candah&acirc;r did not &s;hake the emperor's de&s;ign in favour of Dara. He fore&s;aw the tumult and  di&s;order which were likely to ari&s;e from the ambition of his younger &s;ons after his death; and he re&s;olved to habituate them, in his lifetime, to the authority of their elder brother. Having ordered all the nobles to attend the pre&s;ence; he de&s;cended from his throne, took Dara by the hand, and placed him under the Imperial conopy; commanding the lord of the reque&s;ts to read aloud an edict, changing the name of Dara into that of Shaw Belind Akbal, or THE EMPEROR OF EXALTED FORTUNE. <Q REND="inline">"Behold," &s;aid Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, "your future prince!

we leave the &s;upport of the reputation and honour of the family of Timur."</Q> Nor was this merely a ceremony. He devolved on Dara a part of the Imperial power; and made an allowance of more than two millions a-year, for the expences of his hou&s;e|hold.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Turki&s;h emba&s;&s;y.</NOTE>Soon after this &s;olemn appointment of Dara to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Shaw Jeh&acirc;n made a progre&s;s of plea&s;ure to the city of Ajmere.  During his re&s;idence in that place, Zul&s;ikar Aga, the Turki&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, arrived from Bu&s;&s;ora at Surat. He was received with the u&s;ual honours, and e&s;corted by a party of the Imperial cavalry to court. The pre&s;ents which he brought to the emperor were rather curious and rare, than valuable. He was treated with the highe&s;t di&s;tinction; a table was kept for him at the public ex|pence; and he was gratified with a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent in money for his own private u&s;e. He remained for &s;ome months in Hin|do&s;tan; and Caim Beg, an Omrah of di&s;tinction, returned with him to Con&s;tantinople, on the part of the emperor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar&acirc;ja re|bels, and is reduced.</NOTE>The Mar&acirc;ja, who owed his throne to an Imperial deci&s;ion again&s;t his elder brother, the unfortunate Amar Singh, forgot, about this  time, the gratitude which he owed to Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. He &s;topt the payment of the &s;tipulated tribute, and began to fortify the &s;trong city of Chit&ocirc;r. The emperor detached thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e, under Sadulla the vi&s;ier, to cha&s;ti&s;e him for his in&s;olence, and to demoli&s;h the works. The Hindoo prince hung out the flag of de&s;iance, and the vi&s;ier inve&s;ted Chit&ocirc;r. Parties were at the &s;ame time, detached on all &s;ides to lay wa&s;te the open country. The refractory prince had not the &s;pirit nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his rebellion. He &s;ent, on the eleventh day, to Sadulla a mo&s;t &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive overture of peace.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e and character of Jumla.</NOTE>The mo&s;t memorable tran&s;action of the year was the promotion  of Mahommed Jumla, to the rank of five thou&s;and hor&s;e. He was recommended to the emperor by the prince Aurungz&ecirc;be; and as he is to make a great figure in the &s;equel of the hi&s;tory, there is a propriety in premi&s;ing &s;omething concerning his origin and gradual ri&s;e. Jumla was a Per&s;ian, born in Ardi&s;tan, a village in the neighbourhood of I&s;pahan. His parents, though of &s;ome rank, were extremely poor: he, however, found means to acquire &s;ome knowledge of letters, which circum&s;tance procured for him the place of clerk to a diamond merchant, who made frequent journies to Golconda. In that kingdom he quitted his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, traded on his own account, and acquired a con&s;iderable fortune, which enabled him to purcha&s;e a place at the court of Cuttub, &s;overeign of Tellingana. In that &s;tation he behaved &s;o well that he attracted the notice of his prince, who rai&s;ed him to a con&s;iderable rank in the army. His military promotion opened a field for the abilities of Jumla. He yielded to few in conduct; in courage to none. He ro&s;e by his merit to the head of the forces of Tellingana. He led the army into the Carnatic; and, in a war which continued &s;ix years, reduced that country to &s;ubjection. But when he conquered for his &s;overeign, he acquired wealth for him&s;elf. Cuttub wi&s;hing to &s;hare with his general in the &s;poil, di&s;obliged him; and he attached him&s;elf to the fortunes of Aurungz&ecirc;be, who then commanded for his father in the con|quered provinces of the Decan. The prince, who was an excel|lent judge of character, &s;aw &s;omething extraordinary in Jumla.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Promotions.</NOTE>Soon after the promotion of Jumla, the elde&s;t &s;on of the prince Suja was &s;ent by his father from Bengal to pay his re|&s;pects  to the emperor.

Though jealou&s;y prevailed in private between the po&s;terity of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, in public there was nothing but harmony and affection: Dara who, with the &s;tate of an em|peror, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o a part of the power, treated the &s;on of Suja with di&s;tinction and re&s;pect. His fears of the ambition of Aurungz&ecirc;be ab&s;orbed all his &s;u&s;picions concerning the de&s;igns of his other brothers. Suja, who was a man of plea&s;ure, was not &s;o formidable as the hypocritical au&s;terity of Aurungz&ecirc;be; and the open valour of Mor&acirc;d, without the nece&s;&s;ary balance of prudence, was not an object of &s;erious terror.</P>

His parts were rather &s;olid than &s;hining: indu&s;try and indefa|tigable per&s;everance made up for the defects of his genius. Ex|perience rendered him ma&s;ter of the detail of finance; and he was by habit conver&s;ant in the inferior intrigues, which are the

&s;prings of actions of moment. His mind was too much circum|&s;cribed in its powers, to comprehend, at one view, the great line of public affairs; but he could execute with preci&s;ion what he could not plan with judgment. He was fond of military fame, but he was un&s;ucce&s;sful in the field; though neither deficient in conduct nor di&s;titute of courage. Super&s;tition, which was none of the follies of the age, was the greate&s;t defect in his character; and his &s;anctity was &s;aid to be frequently a cloke for di&s;honourable deeds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War in Gol|conda.</NOTE>The influence of Jumla with Aurungz&ecirc;be, was the &s;ource of a  new war in the Decan, though another cau&s;e was a&s;&s;igned, to reconcile the emperor to the mea&s;ure. Cuttub Shaw, &s;overeign of Tellingana and of a great part of Golconds, had, upon the de&s;ertion of Jumla, impri&s;oned the &s;on of that lord, and &s;eized upon his wealth. Aurungz&ecirc;be complained, in repeated letters, of Cuttub to his father; alleging, that he was dilatory in the pay|ment of his annual tribute to the empire. He therefore applied for leave to bring the refractory prince to rea&s;on by force. The emperor, jealous of his authority, gave permi&s;&s;ion for the march of an army into the dominions of Cuttub. Mahommed, the elde&s;t &s;on of Aurungz&ecirc;be, commanded in this expedition; a brave, an ob&s;tinate, and a haughty prince, not to be &s;wayed from his purpo&s;e either by argument or fear.</P>

A ju&s;t re&s;titution was demanded; and the lat|ter in vain objected, that the accounts between him and Jumla were not &s;ettled; and, therefore, that till they were adju&s;ted, he could form no judgment of the &s;um which ought to be paid. Ma|hommed continued ob&s;tinate, and advanced to the gates of Hydra|bad. When things appeared ready to come to extremities, a few che&s;ts of money and &s;ome ca&s;kets of jewels were delivered by Cuttub, as the whole wealth of Jumla. Am&icirc;n made greater claims in the name of his father; and the prince, offended at the prevarica|tions of Cuttub, ordered him to come out of the city to do him homage, as the grand&s;on of his emperor and lord.</P>

The &s;poils was great, but the de&s;truc|tion was immen&s;e. The avarice of the Imperiali&s;ts was defeated by their fury.

Mahommed waded through blood; Cuttub threw him&s;elf at his feet, but he was not to be appea&s;ed by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The unfortunate prince at length produced his beautiful daughter, Rizia, to the victor, and he &s;heathed his &s;word.

Aurungz&ecirc;be wrote a pompous account of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his &s;on to the emperor; and that monarch rai&s;ed him to the rank of eleven thou&s;and hor&s;e. Shai&s;ta, the &s;on of the late vi&s;ier A&s;iph, was &s;econd in command in the expedition again&s;t Hydrab&acirc;d; and he, as a reward for his &s;ervices, was dignified with the honours of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e. Jumla, who had hitherto remained with Aurungz&ecirc;be at Brampour, charged him&s;elf with the letters of that prince to his father. His &s;on Am&icirc;n attended him to court; and both were received with di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of kindne&s;s and e&s;teem. His knowledge and abilities recom|mended Jumla, in a high degree.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Adil Shaw.</NOTE>The emperor, &s;oon after the promotion of Jumla, took a tour of plea&s;ure toward the north. Having hunted for &s;ome time in the fore&s;ts on the banks of the Ganges, he returned to Agra; and,  upon his arrival, received intelligence of the death of Adil, king of Bijapour. The principal officers at the court of Adil, without a&s;king permi&s;&s;ion of the emperor, rai&s;ed the &s;on of the decea&s;ed to the throne. This conduct was highly re&s;ented by Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, who con&s;idered the dominions of Bijapour as an appendage of the empire. The expedient upon which he fell, was, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, the &s;ource of his misfortunes.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and character of Ali Murdan.</NOTE>In the month of November of the year 1656, died Ali Murdan, the nominal captain-general of the Imperial forces, on his return  from Agra to his province of Ca&s;hmire. His defection from his &s;overeign, the emperor of Per&s;ia, and his delivering up the im|portant fortre&s;s of Candah&acirc;r, had highly recommended him to Shae Jeh&acirc;n; and he had abilities to keep the favour which he had once acquired. The de&s;igns of Shaw Sefi again&s;t his life, were a &s;ufficient apology for his revolt from that prince; and the fidelity with which he &s;erved his benefactor, is a proof that nece&s;&s;ity was the &s;ole cau&s;e of his treachery. He was ra|ther a dignified than a great character; more &s;it for the fatigues of the &s;ield than for the intrigues of the clo&s;et. He was a faith|ful &s;ervant to his prince, a con&s;tant and un&s;haken friend, an active and a gallant officer. A love of money, which did not amount to ab&s;olute avarice, was the greate&s;t defect of his mind; but, were we to judge from the number of his dependants, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a generous di&s;po&s;ition. Being always ab&s;ent from court in
<PB N="207" REF="372">
the government of various provinces, he had no opportunity for expending his va&s;t income; and he therefore ama&s;&s;ed great wealth. The emperor became the heir of his fortune, which, in money and jewels, amounted to one million eight hundred and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition into Bijapour.</NOTE>Intelligence of the march of Jumla flew before him to the  kingdom of Bijapour. Ali, the vi&s;ier of the decea&s;ed Adil, who had rai&s;ed the &s;on of that prince to the throne, had fore&s;een the &s;trom which was now gathering over his head. He levied forces; he fortified his di&s;mantled ca&s;tles and towns. Jumla, in the mean time, advanced to Brampour. Aurungz&ecirc;be joined him with his forces; and, with his u&s;ual affected humility, pretended to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the command of his father's vi&s;ier. That mini&s;ter, however, was too much attached to the intere&s;ts of the prince to avail him&s;elf of his mode&s;ty; and though Jumla bore the name of commander in chief, the orders of Aurungz&ecirc;be were only i&s;&s;ued and obeyed. The greate&s;t harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them; for they reckoned this pre&s;ent expedition as a fortunate prelude to their future de&s;igns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Bider.</NOTE>The rapid march of the Imperiali&s;ts di&s;concerted the mea&s;ures  of Ali. He had collected an army, but it was too &s;mall and the troops too raw to ri&s;que the fortune of the field. He threw a numerous garri&s;on into Bider, which is one of the &s;tronge&s;t places in Hindo&s;tan. With a body of cavalry he him&s;elf hara&s;&s;ed the enemy, leaving the command at Bider to J&acirc;n Ji&s;&s;i; who had been thirty years governor of that important fortre&s;s. Aurungz&ecirc;be arriving before Bider, reconnoitred it with great attention and care. He fore&s;aw the difficulty which would attend a &s;iege; and he endeavoured, by bribes and large promi&s;es, to corrupt the fide|lity of Ji&s;&s;i.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That city taken.</NOTE>On the twenty-&s;eventh day of the &s;iege, a mine being &s;prung, a practicable breach was made in the fir&s;t wall. Aurungz&ecirc;be,  wi&s;hing to make a lodgment within the wall, ordered an a&s;&s;ault. It happened that one of the principal magazines of the place was under a great ba&s;tion in the &s;econd wall, oppo&s;ite to the breach. The be&s;ieged having expended all their granadoes and ammunition in repelling the attack, this magazine was thrown open, that they might &s;upply them&s;elves with more. A rocket by accident fell near the door of the magazine, upon &s;ome powder that had been &s;cattered there in the confu&s;ion. It took fire, and communicating with the magazine, blew up the ba&s;tion, which was covered with people, and de&s;troyed the greate&s;t part of the garri&s;on, who had been drawn together into that place to oppo&s;e the enemy. The governor and his three &s;ons were numbered among the dead. The a&s;&s;ailants, in the mean time, &s;uffered con&s;iderably from the explo&s;ion. The whole place was expo&s;ed. The Imperiali&s;ts took advantage of the con&s;ternation of the &s;urviving part of the enemy. A thick darkne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by the &s;moke and du&s;t, covered Bider: Aurungz&ecirc;be ru&s;hed over the ruins; and when light began to appear, he found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the citadel.

The mini&s;ter,

Aurungz&ecirc;be de&s;pi&s;ed the enemy too much to march again&s;t him in per&s;on. He detached twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e, under the command of Moh&acirc;bet, toward Kilburga; whil&s;t he him&s;elf &s;at down before Kallian, which, after a &s;iege of a few weeks, fell into his hands. Moh&acirc;bet, in the mean time, came to battle with Ali, and defeated his mercenary army with great &s;laughter.

The&s;e repeated efforts weak|ened tho&s;e within; but one of the generals of young Adil, who commanded a body of hor&s;e, was very active in hara&s;&s;ing from without, the Imperial army. He cut off their convoys; and a &s;carcity prevailed in their camp. Aurungz&ecirc;be, however, was not to be driven from his de&s;igns. He carried on the &s;iege with un|abating diligence; and, having made a practicable breach in the walls, he took Kilburga by a&s;&s;ault on the eleventh of June 1657. Adil, led by his mini&s;ter Ali, threw him&s;elf at the feet of the conqueror. The tribute of Bijapour was fixed at one million eight hundred and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and pounds; and a great &s;um toward defraying the expence of the war, was paid down by Adil. He, at the &s;ame time, was obliged to give up his &s;tronge&s;t forts, and to &s;ettle e&s;tates upon &s;ome of the adherents of Aurungz&ecirc;be.

The attachment and gratitude of Jumla to that prince, induced him to reque&s;t the emperor to confer upon him the honour as well as the power in the expedition. The mea&s;ure be&s;ides was favourable to their concerted plans of ambition. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was now become aged; and his exce&s;&s;es in venery had weakened his con&s;titution.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara a&s;&s;umes the govern|ment.</NOTE>The emperor being by his di&s;order rendered incapable of giving any attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, the management of public affairs fell  into the hands of Dara.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;e of the civil wars.</NOTE>SHAW Jeh&acirc;n, after a reign of thirty years of pro&s;perity, found him&s;elf &s;uddenly involved in trouble and misfortune. The &s;torm had been long gathering: it was fore&s;een, but nothing  could prevent it from falling. The emperor, with abilities for bu&s;ine&s;s, was addicted to plea&s;ure; and, though he was deci&s;ive in the pre&s;ent moment, he was improvident of the future. His affection for his &s;ons was the &s;ource of the calamities which &s;hook his empire. Plea&s;ed with their promi&s;ing parts when young, he furni&s;hed them with opportunities for exerting their talents in the cabinet, as well as in the field; and when they became, by their own merit, objects of public attention, it was dangerous, if not impracticable, to reduce them into private &s;tations. The un&s;ettled &s;y&s;tem of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, had rouzed their am|bition, and awakened their fears. They were to each other ob|jects of terror, as well as of envy. They all looked forward with anxiety to the death of their father; and each &s;aw in that
<PB N="216" REF="381">
gloomy point, either a throne or a grave. Their hopes and fears increa&s;ed with their growing age. They had provided them&s;elves again&s;t the important event of his demi&s;e; and when he was &s;eized with what was deemed a mortal di&s;ea&s;e, they broke forth at once from that &s;ilent re&s;pect, which their reverence for the per&s;on and authority of a parent had hitherto impo&s;ed on their minds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Views of the emperor's &s;ons.</NOTE>The means of ambition, which their re&s;pective ranks in the empire had placed in the hands of each of the &s;ons of Shaw  Jeh&acirc;n, were great; but their boldne&s;s to carry their &s;chemes into execution was greater &s;till. High-&s;pirited and intrepid, they wi&s;hed for no object which their natural courage dur&s;t not at|tempt to obtain: they were born for enterprize, and though be|yond mea&s;ure ambitious, they loved danger more than power. Each was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of armies and of trea&s;ures: and, being rivals in fame as well as in influence, they lo&s;t all affection for one another, in the more violent pa&s;&s;ions of the mind. Dara, ve&s;ted with his claim of primogeniture, as well as with his father's declaration in favour of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, con&s;trued the ambition of his brothers into rebellion. Suja, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bengal, was carried by his pride to the re&s;olution of &s;eizing the whole em|pire: Aurungz&ecirc;be covered his ambition with motives of religion; and the vehement Mor&agrave;d arrogated all to him&s;elf by his courage. The figure which the brothers are to make in the &s;ucceeding &s;ccnes, &s;eems to demand a delincation of their re&s;pective charac|ters.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Dara.</NOTE>Dara, the elde&s;t &s;on of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, was polite in his conver|&s;ation, affable, open and free. He was ea&s;y of acce&s;s, acute in  ob&s;ervation, learned, witty and graceful in all his actions. He pryed not into the &s;ecrets of others; and he had no &s;ecret him|&s;elf,
<PB N="217" REF="382">
but what he di&s;dained to hide. He came fairly upon man|kind; he concealed nothing from them, and he expected that faith which he freely gave. Active, lively, and full of fire, he was per&s;onally brave; and he forgot misfortune in the vehe|mence of his mind; which, neglecting pa&s;t evils, looked forward to future good. Though elevated with &s;ucce&s;s, he never was dejected by bad fortune; and though no believer in a particular providence, he met with all the incidents of life as if they had been immoveably determined by Fate. In his public character, he was &s;ometimes moro&s;e, frequently haughty, always ob&s;tinate, and full of pride. Self-&s;ufficient in his opinions, he &s;carce could hear advice with patience; and all he required of his friends was implicit obedience to his commands. But, with this appear|ance of ill-nature, he was in his di&s;po&s;ition humane and kind; for though he was often pa&s;&s;ionate, his rage was not de&s;tructive; and it pa&s;&s;ed &s;uddenly away without leaving a trace of malice behind. In his private character Dara was, in every re&s;pect, un|exceptionable. He was an indulgent parent, a faithful hu&s;band, a dutiful &s;on. When he returned at night to his family, the darkne&s;s which had covered his brow, throughout the day, was di&s;pelled; his countenance was lightened up with joy, and his whole conver&s;ation di&s;played a peculiar &s;erenity and benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition. Though no enemy, from principle, to plea&s;ure, he was naturally virtuous; and he filled up his lei&s;ure time with &s;tudy, in&s;tead of tho&s;e enervating indulgences, which render the princes of the Ea&s;t effeminate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Suja.</NOTE>Suja was humane in his di&s;po&s;ition, aver&s;e to cruelty, an enemy  to oppre&s;&s;ion. In the execution of ju&s;tice, he had no re&s;pect of per&s;ons but when the natural tenderne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition gave his mind a bias toward the unfortunate. Though hone&s;t, like his brother Dara, he was not &s;o open and free. He never told a
<PB N="218" REF="383">
fal&s;ehood; but he did not always tell the whole of the truth. He was more tranquil, more clo&s;e and re&s;erved than Dara; and he was more fitted for the intrigues of party, and that management which is nece&s;&s;ary to direct the various pa&s;&s;ions of men to one point. He was generous to his friends; he did not di&s;dain to hear their advice, though he for the mo&s;t part followed his own judgment of things. He was fond of pomp and magnificence; and much addicted to the plea&s;ures of the haram. Graceful and active in his own per&s;on, he loved in women that complete &s;ym|metry of limbs which rendered him&s;elf the favourite of the &s;ex; and he &s;pared no expence in filling his &s;eraglio with ladies re|markable for their beauty and accompli&s;hments. In their &s;ociety he &s;pent too much of his time; but the warmth of his con&s;titu|tion did not make him neglect the nece&s;&s;ary affairs of life. Dur|ing his long government of Bengal, he won the affections of the people by the &s;oftne&s;s of his manners, and his exact and ri|gorous execution of ju&s;tice; and the country flouri&s;hed in com|merce and agriculture, under the protection which he invariably gave to indu&s;try. In battle he was brave; nor was he de&s;titute of the talents nece&s;&s;ary for a general; and we much attribute his misfortunes in the field to the effeminacy of his troops, more than to his own want of conduct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Aurung|z&ecirc;be.</NOTE>The character of Aurungz&ecirc;be differed in every re&s;pect from tho&s;e of his elder brothers. De&s;titute of that graceful appear|ance  of per&s;on which rendered them popular as &s;oon as &s;een, he acquired by addre&s;s that influence over mankind, which nature had on them be&s;towed. In di&s;po&s;ition &s;erious and melancholy, he e&s;tabli&s;hed an opinion of the &s;olidity of his under&s;tanding, even among tho&s;e who had no opportunity of being acquainted with his great talents. Pliant and accommodating in his man|ner, he gained mankind by flattering their pride; and he wrapt
<PB N="219" REF="384">
up his behaviour in &s;uch plau&s;ibility, that they attributed his at|tention to their own merit, more than to his de&s;igns. His com|mon conver&s;ation turned always on trifles. In affairs of moment he was re&s;erved, crafty, and full of di&s;&s;imulation. Religion, the great engine of political impo&s;tors, he profe&s;&s;ed in all its &s;everity. With it he deceived the weak, and awed into a kind of reverence for his per&s;on, the greate&s;t enemies of his power. Though not remarkable for humanity, he did not naturally delight in blood; but ambition was his darling pa&s;&s;ion, and before it vani&s;hed all the &s;ofter feelings of the &s;oul. Fear, which renders other tyrants cruel, had no place in his brea&s;t; but that provident caution, which wi&s;hes to &s;hut up every acce&s;s to danger, made him care|le&s;s about the lives of his rivals. He had a particular talent for kindling di&s;&s;entions among tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed his de&s;igns; and his art and cunning were more de&s;tructive to his enemies than his &s;word.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Mor&acirc;d.</NOTE>Mor&acirc;d, the younge&s;t &s;on of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, was by con&s;titution  lively and full of fire. With too much levity for bu&s;ine&s;s, he gave up his time to mirth, action and amu&s;ement. He delighted in the chace; he was more fond of battle than of war. In rid|ing, in bending the bow, in throwing the lance, he met with few that could equal him in the armies which he commanded; and he was more de&s;irous of carrying the palm in the manly ex|erci&s;es of the field, than in the intrigues of the cabinet. He de&s;pi&s;ed all cabals: he gloried in keeping nothing &s;ecret. He thought it beneath his dignity to command mankind by art; and he openly profe&s;&s;ed, that he di&s;dained to owe di&s;tinction to any thing but the &s;word. <Q REND="inline">"To po&s;&s;e&s;s a throne by the will of a pa|rent, to owe it to birth," &s;aid Mor&acirc;d, "is unworthy of a great prince; and had not my brother &s;upported his preten&s;ions to the crown by arms, I would di&s;dain to wear it."</Q> In battle his &s;oul
<PB N="220" REF="385">
was a &s;tranger to fear; he was even an enthu&s;ia&s;t in his love of danger, and &s;laughter was his favourite pa&s;time. In peace he was mild, though proud, liberal, affable and humane. But his very virtues were weakne&s;s; and his fate furni&s;hes a melancholy proof, that an open genero&s;ity of &s;pirit is never a match for hy|pocri&s;y and deceit. His &s;plendid qualities, however, rendered him popular in the army; and Aurungz&ecirc;be, notwith&s;tanding his &s;upe|riority of parts, owed, at la&s;t, his &s;ucce&s;s over Mor&acirc;d, as much, atlea&s;t, to accident as to his known talents. Such were the illu&s;trious com|petitors for the throne of their father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suja takes the field.</NOTE>Suja, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the government of Bengal for many  years, was the fir&s;t who appeared in the field, upon receiving in|telligence of the dangerous illne&s;s of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. He excu&s;ed his mea&s;ures by the violence of Dara. He was informed, that he had nothing to expect from his brother &s;hould he po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne, but impri&s;onment, or even death; and he affirmed, that nece&s;&s;ity had rendered rebellion lawful. The re&s;ources which Suja po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s to his enterpri&s;e. He had accumula|ted trea&s;ure, and levied an army; and, though his agent at court tran&s;mitted to him accounts of his father's recovery, he affected not to credit the intelligence. When he pitched his tent in the field, he i&s;&s;ued out a manife&s;to, which bore that Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was dead; and that there were violent &s;u&s;picions of Dara's being acce&s;&s;ary to his death. Though he received letters from the hands of his father, announcing his recovery, he alledged that they were a forgery by Dara to amu&s;e him, and to divert him from his in|tentions of revenging the death of the emperor on the parricide. The enemies of Dara contributed by their letters to make Suja per&s;i&s;t in his re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="386">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppo&s;ed by Solim&acirc;n Shek&ocirc;.</NOTE>Dara had the earlie&s;t intelligence of the de&s;igns of his brother; and he made the nece&s;&s;ary preparations again&s;t him. His &s;on Solim&acirc;n, had marched with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, to quell &s;ome  di&s;turbances in the province of Allahab&acirc;d. Dara ordered a rein|forcement to fall down the Jumna, and to join Solim&acirc;n. Raja Joy Singh and Debere Chan commanded the detachment, and they had po&s;itive in&s;tructions, after joining the prince, to &s;top the pro|gre&s;s of Suja to the capital with the &s;word. The emperor, how|ever, repented of orders procured from him by the violence of Dara. He was aver&s;e to a civil war; and he &s;ent &s;ecret direc|tions to Joy Singh to endeavour to induce Suja to return to his government of Bengal. The&s;e directions were &s;carce di&s;|patched to the Raja, when advices arrived at court that the prince Mor&acirc;d, who commanded in the kingdom of Guzerat, was pro|claimed emperor by the army; that the receiver-general of the Imperial revenues, in oppo&s;ing the u&s;urpation, had been &s;lain in battle; and that Mor&acirc;d, having negociated a con&s;iderable loan with the bankers of Ahmedab&acirc;d, had coined money in his own name.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suja &s;urpriz|ed in his camp,</NOTE>The intelligence of this &s;econd rebellion ha&s;tened Suja in his mea&s;ures. He wi&s;hed to be the fir&s;t of the competitors who  &s;hould arrive at the capital; and he therefore moved his camp to Ben&acirc;ris. When he was bu&s;y in con&s;tructing a bridge of boats for cro&s;&s;ing the Ganges, Solim&acirc;n appeared in &s;ight on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore with his army. A negociation was &s;et on foot with Suja by Joy Singh; and it was at la&s;t agreed, that the prince &s;hould return to his government, and di&s;band his army. The active &s;pirit of Solim&acirc;n did not reli&s;h this precarious pacification. Joy Singh, without his participation, had &s;ettled the terms with Suja; and he did not think him&s;elf bound by a truce, in which he had no hand. He changed his ground, and moved a
<PB N="222" REF="387">
few miles up the Ganges. The river by an extraordinary drought was remarkably low. Solim&acirc;n, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of every body, di&s;covered a ford by which the cavalry could pa&s;s. The circum&s;tance was too favourable to the inclinations of the prince, not to be turned to immediate advantage. In the night he forded the river; and, when day-light appeared, fell &s;uddenly on Suja's camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and defeated.</NOTE>Suja, who con&s;idered the Ganges as an in&s;uperable barrier, per|mitted him&s;elf to be completely &s;urprized. The &s;houts of the  army, the cla&s;hing of &s;words fir&s;t rouzed him from &s;leep. He &s;tarted from his bed, &s;eized his arms, ru&s;hed forth, and mounted his hor&s;e. When he looked round him, he beheld nothing but confu&s;ion and terror, and &s;laughter and flight. His voice was not heard in the tumult; and if heard, it was not obeyed. The crowd around him was great; but his army was too much agi|tated by fear to be reduced to any form. As no man could tru&s;t to another, each endeavoured to provide for his own &s;afety by flight. The &s;laughter of tho&s;e who &s;tood, retarded the enemy in their pur&s;uit of the fugitives. Suja, with &s;ome of his officers, fought with courage; but they were driven into the river; and the prince with great difficulty made his e&s;cape in a canoe, and fell down the &s;tream without &s;topping, tell he reached Mongeer. Solim&acirc;n, after his victory, marched into Bengal, and be&s;ieged Suja in the fort of Mongeer. But we mu&s;t turn our attention to ano|ther quarter of the empire.</P>

He did  not continue long in that city. He took up his re&s;idence in a town in the neighbourhood of Dowlatab&acirc;d, which he had re|built, and called after his own name Aurungabad. In this place
<PB N="223" REF="388">
he received the fir&s;t news of his father's illne&s;s;<NOTE PLACE="marg">father's illne&s;s.</NOTE> but three months relap&s;ed before he heard any further intelligence from court. Dara, who was re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf firmly on the  throne in ca&s;e of the demi&s;e of his father, had placed guards on all the ferries and highways; at the &s;ame time i&s;&s;uing orders to all the officers of the cu&s;toms, and the commanders of di&s;tricts, to &s;top all letters and travellers. The&s;e circum&s;tances induced Au|rungz&ecirc;be to believe that his father was dead; and he began to levy forces for his own &s;ecurity. In the mid&s;t of his pre|parations, letters were received from Mor&acirc;d, who commanded in Guzerat. That prince informed Aurungz&ecirc;be that Dara had u&s;urped the throne, and was taking mea&s;ures for cutting off his brothers. He therefore propo&s;ed that they &s;hould join in their own defence. Aurungz&ecirc;be embraced Mor&acirc;d's propo&s;al with joy. He knew his own &s;uperior abilities, which were more than a match for the open valour of Mor&acirc;d; and he hoped, that if by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could defeat Dara, his own way to the throne would be paved. A negociation with Mor&acirc;d was opened, and the preparations for war continued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gains over</NOTE>Jumla, who had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the office of vi&s;ier by Dara,  arrived in the mean time from Agra in the Decan. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n having di&s;approved of that lord's being turned out of his di|partment, endeavoured to gratify him in &s;ome other way; and had, for that purpo&s;e, given him the command of a con&s;iderable body of troops, to reduce &s;ome places which &s;till held out in the lately conquered provinces. Dara, who was jealous of Jumla's known attachment to Aurungz&ecirc;be, kept his family in the capital as the ho&s;tages of his faith. Jumla, pitching his camp in the neighbourhood of Aurungabad, was informed of Aurungz&ecirc;be's preparations for war. He &s;ent him a me&s;&s;age, informing him that the emperor was recovered, and had re&s;umed the reins of go|vernment.
<PB N="224" REF="389">
The prince, a&s;toni&s;hed at the coldne&s;s of Jumla, &s;ent to demand a conference: but that lord, fearing the &s;pies of Dara who were di&s;per&s;ed over the camp, refu&s;ed to wait upon a man, who was arming again&s;t his &s;overeign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jumla</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be penetrated into the cau&s;e of this cautious con|duct. He knew that he was attached to his intere&s;t; and that  it was only the fear of Dara's re&s;entment again&s;t his family, pre|vented him from joining with alacrity in his own views. He therefore had recour&s;e to art. Mahommed Mauzim, the &s;econd &s;on of Aurungz&ecirc;be, was a great favourite with Jumla. That prince was &s;ent to vi&s;it him with proper in&s;tructions from his fa|ther. Mauzim, who was then about &s;eventeen years of age, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a part of Aurungz&ecirc;be's addre&s;s. He waited upon Jumla in his tent, without any previous notice, and was received with great kindne&s;s and di&s;tinction. When night was coming on, Jumla put the prince in mind of the time; and Mauzim told him, that having waited upon him without either the permi&s;|&s;ion or knowledge of his father, he was afraid of returning without the cu&s;tomary honour of being attended by the per|&s;on to whom he had paid the vi&s;it. Jumla, who was a&s;ham|ed of being defective in point of politene&s;s, agreed to accom|pany Mauzim home. When they came to the prince's apart|ment, Jumla &s;ignified his intention of returning; he was, however, per&s;uaded to enter. Mauzim retired, and his father ap|peared. He earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted, that Jumla with the army under his command, &s;hould join in his de&s;igns upon the throne. That lord excu&s;ed him&s;elf, on account of his family, who were in the hands of Dara. It was at length ageced, that the per&s;on of Jumla &s;hould be &s;eized; and an order i&s;&s;ued for con&s;i&s;cating all his effects. This expedient &s;ecured him the re&s;entment of both par|ties; and a door of reconciliation was left open, whichever

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches from Au|rungabad.</NOTE>On the &s;ixteenth of February 1658, Aurungz&ecirc;be marched from  Aurungabad with twelve thou&s;and hor&s;e; leaving his &s;econd &s;on Mauzim with a &s;ufficient force for the protection of the Decan, from whence he intended to derive his &s;upplies for the war. Nijabut Chan, de&s;cended in a direct line from Timur, com|manded his vanguard, and took the rout of Brampour. He him|&s;elf followed with the main body, and arrived on the fir&s;t of March at that place. He remained at Brampour near a month, for an an&s;wer to the di&s;patches which he had &s;ent to Guzerat to his brother. His propo&s;als to that prince were &s;o obviou&s;ly hypo|critical, that only the open &s;pirit of Mor&acirc;d, who, being full of hone&s;ty him&s;elf, &s;u&s;pected no guile in others, could be for a moment deceived. He profe&s;&s;ed in his letters, that he had al|ways been his affectionate friend; that Dara, from his natural weakne&s;s, was incapable of holding the reins of government, be|&s;ides that he was from principle indifferent about all religion; that Suja, with abilities little &s;uperior to Dara, was a heretic, and by con&s;equence unworthy of the crown. <Q REND="inline">"As for me," con|tinues Aurungz&ecirc;be, "I have long &s;ince dedicated my&s;elf to the &s;ervice of God.

On the twenty-&s;econd of March, Au|rungz&ecirc;be having received the di&s;patches of Mor&acirc;d, left the city of Brampour, and took the rout of Ugein, where the brothers had preconcerted to join their forces. Arriving on the banks of the Nirbidda, he was informed that the Maraja, Je&s;&s;wint Singh, had, on the part of Dara, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ugein, with &s;eventy thou&s;and hor&s;e. He was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;hed, that the enemy had not &s;ent a part of his army to guard the pa&s;&s;age of the river, which might have &s;topt his progre&s;s.

The conduct of the Maraja, who was per&s;onally brave, proceeded in a great mea&s;ure from his pride and arrogance. He was heard to &s;ay, That he waited for the junction of the brothers, that he might in one day triumph over two Imperial princes. Aurungz&ecirc;be owed his &s;afety to this unaccountable folly. His &s;mall army, when he arrived on the banks of the Nirbidda, was &s;o much fatigued with the march, and &s;pent with the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the weather, that he might be routed by an incon&s;i|derable force.</P>

Aurung|z&ecirc;be di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to ha&s;ten Mor&acirc;d, who was &s;till about fifteen miles di&s;tant. He him&s;elf, in the mean time, re&s;olved to take the pre&s;ent opportunity to pa&s;s the river, which by the late extreme drought had become fordable. He placed, therefore, his artillery, which was worked by &s;ome Frenchmen in his &s;ervice, on a ri&s;ing ground, and entered the river in columns, under his own fire. The Maraja, tru&s;ting to the height of the banks and his advanced-guard, who were already engaged with the enemy, contented him&s;elf with drawing up his army in order of battle at a di&s;tance. Aurungz&ecirc;be, having forced the pa&s;&s;age of the river, encamped on its bank; and the next day he was joined by Mo|r&acirc;d, who had left his army on their march. The brothers, after a long conference, re&s;olved to attack the enemy by the dawn of the morning; whil&s;t orders were &s;ent to the forces of Mor&acirc;d, who were not yet arrived, to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s for ac|tion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 22, de|feats the Ma|raja.</NOTE>The Maraja, by his &s;couts, being appri&s;ed of the motions of the  rebels, was ready to receive them. He drew up, before day-light, his army in order of battle, to be ready to accommodate his di&s;po|&s;itions afterwards to the appearance of the enemy's line. He ac|cordingly began the action with the Mogul cavalry, but the&s;e were &s;oon repul&s;ed by the veteran troops of Aurungz&ecirc;be. The Maraja, who fore&s;aw the di&s;comfiture of the Moguls, &s;hewed behind them the front of thirty thou&s;and of his native troops the Rajaputs, in whom he chiefly confided. Aurungz&ecirc;be, upon &s;eeing this formi|dable body, drew back from the pur&s;uit, and re&s;tored his line. The Maraja advanced with impetuo&s;ity, and the prince met him half way. The &s;hock was extremely violent; and the rebels were on the point of giving way, when Mor&acirc;d, with his troops, ju&s;t
<PB N="228" REF="393">
arrived on the field, attacked the enemy in flank. The vic|tory was &s;natched from the hands of the Rajaputs: their prince di&s;dained to fly. The wings were broken and ruined; but the center, animated by the pre&s;ence of their prince, &s;tood its ground. Slaughter and danger increa&s;ed every moment. Mor&acirc;d was irre|&s;i&s;tible on the right flank; and Aurungz&ecirc;be, who had been on the point of retreating, advanced again to the charge. The Rajaputs behaved with their u&s;ual bravery; but they were &s;urrounded on all &s;ides. The action became mixed and undi&s;tingui&s;hed. Friends were mi&s;taken for foes, and foes for friends. Uncertainty would have &s;u&s;pended the &s;word, but fear made it fall every where. About the &s;etting of the &s;un, the field, covered with ten thou&s;and dead bodies on the &s;ide of the enemy, was left to Aurungz&ecirc;be and Mor&acirc;d. The Maraja, after the battle was over, drove his chariot, by way of bravado, quite round the army of the victors; and when it was propo&s;ed to Aurungz&ecirc;be that a party &s;hould be de|tached in pur&s;uit of that prince, <Q REND="inline">"No," he replied, "let the wounded boar have time to fly."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;culine behaviour of the Maraja's wi&s;e.</NOTE>The bad &s;ucce&s;s of the Maraja proceeded not more from his own  folly, than from the addre&s;s of Aurungz&ecirc;be. That prince had his emi&s;&s;aries in the Imperial camp, who in&s;inuated to the rigid Ma|hommedans, that &s;hould the Maraja prevail, their religion would be at an end in India. The Moguls accordingly made but a faint re&s;i&s;tance; and the whole weight of the action fell upon the Rajaputs. The Maraja, after his defeat, was a&s;hamed to appear at court. He retreated to his own country; but his wife, a woman of a ma&s;culine &s;pirit, di&s;dained to receive a hu&s;band not covered with victory. She &s;hut the gates of her ca&s;tle again&s;t him.

To be the me&s;&s;enger of the ruin of his armies, to &s;how the world that he fears death more than di&s;grace, is now become the employment of my hu&s;|band. But I have no hu&s;band. It is an impo&s;tor that knocks at our gates. Je&s;&s;wint is no more. The blood of kings could not &s;urvive his lo&s;s of fame. Prepare the funeral pile!

She her&s;elf was the daughter of the late Rana, and Je&s;&s;wint was of the &s;ame family.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurungz&ecirc;be remains at Ugein.</NOTE>The princes, after their victory over the Maraja, entered Ugein in triumph. Mor&acirc;d, who loved battle as a pa&s;time, was unwill|ing  to &s;top in that city; but Aurungz&ecirc;be convinced him that it was nece&s;&s;ary to refre&s;h the troops for a few days, after the fa|tigues of a long march, and the toils of an ob&s;tinate action.

If Dara was the &s;overeign, Aurungz&ecirc;be had no doubt of carrying all before him, on account of the unpopularity of that prince among the nobility; but if the reins of government had reverted into the hands of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, who was, in a manner, adored both by the army and

the people, he was &s;ure that even his own troops would de&s;ert him in a day of battle. He had &s;ent privately expre&s;&s;es to his friends at Agra, and he waited for their return.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perplexity of the emperor.</NOTE>The news of the battle near the Nirbidda arrived, in the mean  time, at court. Dara was enraged at the Moguls, from who&s;e cowardice or perfidy the rebels derived their &s;ucce&s;s. The empe|ror him&s;elf was perplexed beyond mea&s;ure. He was &s;n&s;ible of the determined re&s;olution of his rebel &s;ons: he dreaded the violence of Dara. He &s;aw nothing but misfortune before him, and &s;ome dreadful calamity hanging over him&s;elf and his family. The eager preparations of Dara for another battle, alarmed him as much as the approach of the rebels. A victory would make Dara ma&s;ter of the empire: a defeat would throw him&s;elf into the hands of tho&s;e whom he oppo&s;ed. His mind flew from one re&s;olution to another, and he could &s;ix on none. The pro&s;pect was gloomy before him; and &s;eeing no point on which he could re&s;t his hopes, he left all to chance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations of Dara,</NOTE>Dara, with the natural activity and vehemence of his temper,  prepared, with redoubled vigour, for the field. He pa&s;&s;ed like a flame through the capital, and kindled thou&s;ands into an eagerne&s;s equal to his own. When the fir&s;t news of the defeat of the Maraja came to court, Dara &s;ent an expre&s;s to his &s;on Solim&acirc;n, who be|&s;ieged Suja in Mongeer. He de&s;ired him to make the be&s;t terms which the urgency of the times would admit with Suja, and to return to Agra by forced marches. A negociation was opened ac|cordingly with the be&s;ieged prince. His neee&s;&s;ities made him li&s;ten, with eagerne&s;s, to a treaty. Solim&acirc;n, in the name of the emperor, rein&s;tated him in the government of Bengal, after hav|ing exacted from him a &s;olemn promi&s;e of taking no farther part in the war. He him&s;elf marched, night and day, to reinforce his

Solim&acirc;n was then in the twenty-&s;ixth year of his age; graceful in his per&s;on, and vigorous in his mind. Nature &s;eemed to have formed him for war. He was brave in action, &s;edate, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the greate&s;t dangers. He was generous in his di&s;po&s;ition, liberal in his &s;entiments, plea&s;ing to his friends, humane to his enemies. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fire and warmth of Dara without his weakne&s;&s;es; the prudence of Aurung|z&ecirc;be without his meanne&s;s and deceit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who marches again&s;t Au|rungz&ecirc;be and Mor&acirc;d.</NOTE>The Imperial army, in the mean time, marched out of Agra  under the conduct of Dara. The emperor became more and more perplexed, as matters approached to a deci&s;ion. He knew that the nobles loved not Dara: he knew that the be&s;t troops were ab&s;ent with Solim&acirc;n. One expedient only remained, and that, if followed, would have in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s. He ordered the Impe|rial tent to be pitched without the walls; declaring, that he would take the field in per&s;on again&s;t the rebels. His frineds &s;aw an end to his troubles in this re&s;olution. His own army to a man would die in defence of his power; and even the troops of Au|rungz&ecirc;be and Mor&acirc;d had openly declared, that they would not draw their &s;words again&s;t Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. The infatuation of Dara pre|vented his father's de&s;igns. He had recour&s;e to intreaty, and when that failed, to commands. The emperor, who&s;e intellects had been in &s;ome mea&s;ure impaired by his illne&s;s, was, at fir&s;t, &s;hocked at the ob&s;tinacy of Dara. That prince, who&s;e &s;ilial piety was even greater than his ambition, waited upon his father. He threw him&s;elf at his feet, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ted that he would not endanger his health by taking the field; as, upon his life, the pro&s;perity of the empire depended, in days of &s;o much trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="397">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charge given him by his father.</NOTE>The emperor, having yielded to the intreaties of Dara, conjured him, though bent on war, to avoid coming to action till the arri|val of his &s;on.

He &s;aid not a word to his father; but his countenance expre&s;&s;ed chagrin and di&s;content. <Q REND="inline">"Then go, my &s;on," &s;aid Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, "but return not without victory to me.

Dara placed him&s;elf immediately at the head of the army, which con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred thou&s;and hor&s;e, with a thou&s;and pieces of cannon. He advanced ha&s;tily to the banks of the river Chunbul, which is twenty miles from Agra. A ridge of mountains, which extend them&s;elves to Guzerat, advance into the plain country, along the Chunbul, to within twenty-five miles of the river Jumna; and this pa&s;s Dara occupied with &s;trong lines, &s;trengthened by redoubts, which were mounted with artillery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurungz&ecirc;be turns the rear of the Impe|rial army, June 1.</NOTE>Dara had not long remained behind his lines, when the princes, on the fir&s;t of June, appeared on the oppo&s;ite bank of the Chun|bul,  and pitched their camp within &s;ight of the Imperial army. Aurungz&ecirc;be reconnoitred the &s;ituation of the enemy, but he was not to be forced. His army con&s;i&s;ted not of forty thou&s;and men; and they were fatigued with the heat of the weather and the length of their march. But there was no time to be lo&s;t. Solim&acirc;n, co|vered with laurels, was approaching fa&s;t with the flower of the Imperial army, to &s;upport his father's cau&s;e. No hopes pre&s;ented them&s;elves to Aurungz&ecirc;be; and he became, of a &s;udden, &s;ullen, melancholy, and perplexed. To retreat was ruin: to advance de|&s;truction. He was lo&s;t in &s;u&s;pence. Mor&acirc;d, with his u&s;ual love

of arduous undertakings, was for forcing the lines; but a letter from Shai&s;ta, the &s;on of A&s;iph J&acirc;h, and who was third in com|mand in the Imperial army, broke off that mea&s;ure, by pre&s;enting a better to the brothers. This treacherous lord informed Au|rungz&ecirc;be, that to attempt the lines would be folly, and that the only means left him was to leave his camp &s;tanding to amu&s;e Dara, and to march through the hills by a bye-road, which two chiefs, who were directed to attend him in the evening, would point out. The princes clo&s;ed with the propo&s;al. The guides joined them in the evening, and they decamped with the greate&s;t &s;ilence, leaving their tents, baggage, and artillery under a &s;trong guard, who were to amu&s;e the enemy.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara's order of battle, June 5.</NOTE>Dara decamped from his lines with precipitation, leaving the  greater part of his cannon behind him. By a forced march he pu&s;hed between the enemy and the capital; and on the fourth of June he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the rebels. On the morning of the fifth, the prince ordered the army to be formed in order of battle. Ru&s;tum Chan, an experienced general from Tartary, mar&s;halled the field. The artillery was placed in the front, joined together with chains to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the cavalry of the enemy. Behind the artillery &s;tood a number of camels, mounted with &s;mall &s;wivels, which the riders of each camel, without lighting, could charge and di&s;charge with ea&s;e. In the rear were drawn up the mu&s;queteers in three lines; and the two wings were formed of the cavalry, armed with bows and arrows together with &s;abres. One third of the cavalry formed the re&s;erve behind the lines. Dara placed him&s;elf in the center, mounted on a lofty elephant, from which he could command a view of the field. The treache|rous Shai&s;ta took the command of the right wing; and that of the
<PB N="234" REF="399">
left was de&s;tined by Dara for Ru&s;tum. That officer, who was ac|knowleged the mo&s;t experienced commander in Hindo&s;tan, was actually at the head of the army. He bore the commi&s;&s;ion of cap|tain-general, and all orders were i&s;&s;ued by him. He repre&s;ented to Dara, before the action commenced, that he intended to place him&s;elf at the head of the re&s;erve in the rear, where he might di|rect the movements of the field, and i&s;&s;ue out his orders as the cir|cum&s;tances of affairs might require. <Q REND="inline">"My po&s;t," &s;aid Dara, "is in the front of battle; and I expect that all my friends &s;hall par|take of my danger, if they wi&s;h to &s;hare the glory which I hope to obtain."</Q> The generous and intrepid &s;pirit of Ru&s;tum was of|fended at this reflection.

He endeavoured to per&s;uade Ru&s;tum to remain at the head of the re&s;erve; but he went beyond hearing, and placed him&s;elf in the front of the left wing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That of Au|rungz&ecirc;be.</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be, on the other hand, having mar&s;halled his army in|to  order of battle, reque&s;ted of Mor&acirc;d to take the command of the center. He committed the left wing to his &s;on Mahommed, and he placed him&s;elf on the right. Mor&acirc;d was a&s;toni&s;hed, and plea&s;ed at the ea&s;e with which Aurungz&ecirc;be a&s;&s;igned to him the po&s;t of ho|nour. But the crafty prince had two rea&s;ons for his conduct. Mor&acirc;d was haughty, he had a&s;&s;umed the Imperial titles, and though, out of a pretended complai&s;ance to his father, he had laid them down, he looked forward with undeviating ardour to the throne. It was not the bu&s;ine&s;s of Aurungz&ecirc;be to offend him at this critical juncture. But his other rea&s;on was equally prudent. Ru&s;tum commanded the left wing of the enemy; and he was the

mo&s;t renowned general of the times. He had pa&s;&s;ed many years in the &s;ervice of the Tartars and Per&s;ians, being bred up to the the field from his youth, in which he had always eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf. He had been pre&s;ent in one hundred general actions; he was habituated to danger, and perfect ma&s;ter of his own mind in the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;ituations.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle begins.</NOTE>Both lines began now to move from wing to wing; and the ar|tillery  opened on both &s;ides. Ru&s;tum advanced, on the left, with a ha&s;ty pace, directing the march of his troops by the motion of his &s;word. Aurungz&ecirc;be ordered a part of his artillery to point toward Ru&s;tum; and that general received a cannon-ball in his brea&s;t, when he had advanced within five yards of the enemy. The whole wing &s;topt at the fall of Ru&s;tum: but Sitter&s;al, one of the chiefs of the Rajaputs, at the head of five thou&s;and hor&s;e, fell in, &s;word in hand, with Aurungz&ecirc;be. Shaw Mahommed, who commanded under the prince, oppo&s;ed the Rajaputs with great bravery. A &s;harp conflict en&s;ued; and the Rajaputs began to file off, when their leader engaged per&s;onally with Shaw Mahom|med. The Rajaputs &s;trove to cover their chief, but in vain; he was cut down by the &s;abre of Mahommed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara's brave|ry.</NOTE>Dara, mounted on his elephant, in the mean time advanced with the center. He was ob&s;erved by his army to look over all the line,  and they gathered courage from his intrepid demeanor. A part of the enemy's artillery was oppo&s;ed to the very point where Dara advanced.

they re&s;umed their ranks, and followed him with ardour. Before he could come to blows with the enemy, a &s;econd volley occa&s;ioned a &s;econd di&s;order. He however &s;tood up on his ele|phant, and, without any change in his countenance, called out with a loud voice to advance with &s;peed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mor&acirc;d's bravery.</NOTE>The whole center under Mor&acirc;d was broken, and the prince  him&s;elf was covered with wounds. He endeavoured to lead his troops again to the charge; but they were deaf to his commands. He ordered his elephant to be driven among the thicke&s;t of the enemy; being determined to fall with his fortune, or, by a brave example, to re-animate his flying troops with hopes of recovering the day. His boldne&s;s was attended with &s;ucce&s;s. His &s;quadron &s;eeing the enemy &s;urrounding their prince, were a&s;hamed of their terror, and poured around him. Arib Da&s;s, an Indian chief, thrice &s;trove to reach Mor&acirc;d with his &s;word; but he did not &s;ucceed, on account of the height of the elephant. He, however, cut the pil|lars which &s;upported the roof of the Amari or ca&s;tle, which falling upon the prince, incumbered him in &s;uch a manner, that he could not defend him&s;elf.

But a cannon-ball having taken off the head of his fo&s;ter-brother, who &s;at with him on the elephant, he was almo&s;t blinded with the blood.

It was at the very in&s;tant that he came to blows with the Imperiali&s;ts, that the unfortunate Dara di&s;mount|ed from his elephant.

He who never received coun&s;el before, was ruined by hearkening to advice; and Aurungz&ecirc;be, who had placed his hopes on art and intrigue, owed, at la&s;t, his &s;ucce&s;s to his valour. Dara, like a de&s;|perate gambler, threw all upon throw; and when Fortune fa|voured him in that, he turned the dye for his foes. Had he permitted Shaw Jeh&acirc;n to have taken the field, his brothers would &s;carce have dared to negociate for their lives; had he waited for his gallant &s;on, it would not have been a conte&s;t but a flight. But ambition had dazzled the eyes of Dara, and he could not &s;ee things in their proper light. Had the emperor appeared at the head of his forces, his power would be at an end. Had So|lim&acirc;n arrived fre&s;h from the conque&s;t of Suja, the glory of victory would have re&s;ted upon that prince. Dara, unfortunately for him&s;elf, was, from his love of power, afraid of his father; and, from the de&s;ire of fame, envious of the renown of his &s;on.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE>THE deci&s;ive battle, which qua&s;hed for ever the hopes of Dara, and gave the crown of Hindo&s;tan to Aurungz&ecirc;be, was fought within &s;ixteen miles of Agra. The victor, a&s;toni&s;hed  at a piece of good fortune which he did not expect, pur&s;ued not his enemies beyond the field. The fugitives on both &s;ides had rallied, in the rear of the &s;mall parties who continued the action, and pre&s;ented a &s;hew of firmne&s;s, without any inclination of renewing the combat. To an unconcerned &s;pectator it would have been difficult to determine which party had prevailed. The flight on each &s;ide was equal; and the field was left, by both armies, to the dead. But Dara was conquered in his own mind; he pa&s;&s;ed &s;uddenly through the half-formed lines of his rallied army, and men, who wanted but an excu&s;e for flight, relinqui&s;hed their ground with precipitation. Aurungz&ecirc;be was fir&s;t convinced
<PB N="240" REF="405">
of his victory by its con&s;equences; but whether from policy or fear is uncertain, he forbore to advance towards Agra. He gave time to his troops to recover from their terror; as well as room to his enemies to increa&s;e their panic: be&s;ides, the affairs of his rival were not de&s;perate. Should the emperor take the field in per&s;on, the rebel princes, notwith&s;tanding the advantages which they had obtained, would have vani&s;hed from his pre&s;ence. But his di&s;temper had not left Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, and he was incumbered with the indolence of age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara appears before his father.</NOTE>The emperor had &s;at all day, in anxious expectation, in the  tower over that gate of the citadel which looked toward the field of battle. Parties of fugitives had often alarmed his fears; but the expre&s;&s;es from Dara, during the time of action, had as often re&s;tored his hopes. The prince at length came to the foot of the wall, with marks of his own defeat. To mention the re&s;ult of the battle was &s;uperfluous; his appearance betrayed mis|fortune. <Q REND="inline">"The rebels, I perceive, have prevailed," &s;aid Shaw Jeh&acirc;n with a &s;igh; "but Dara Shek&ocirc; mu&s;t have had &s;ome other cau&s;e than fear for his flight."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Yes," replied the prince, "there is a cau&s;e. The traitor Shai&s;ta Chan! I have lo&s;t the empire, but let him not e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed."</Q> The emperor bent his eyes to the ground, and for &s;ome time uttered not one word; at length &s;uddenly &s;tarting up, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What means Dara to do?"</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"To defend the&s;e walls,"</Q> replied the prince. <Q REND="inline">"You de|ceive your&s;elf," &s;aid Shaw Jeh&acirc;n; "walls are no defence to tho&s;e who have failed in the field."</Q> Having expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e words, he ordered the bye&s;tanders to remove. He then advi&s;ed Dara to &s;et out immediately for Delhi. He told him, That the governor of that city &s;hould have orders to &s;upply him with all the public money in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and that an expre&s;s &s;hould be immediately di&s;patched to his &s;on Solim&acirc;n, to march along the
<PB N="241" REF="406">
northern banks of the Ganges, and to join him in the province of Do&acirc;b, which lies between that river and the Jumna.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Flies</NOTE>Dara, approving of this advice, retired to his own palace, and  made preparations for his immediate flight. He loaded all his elephants and chariots with his women and &s;laves; and for want of bea&s;ts of burden, he imprudently left his trea&s;ure behind. About midnight, the unfortunate prince i&s;&s;ued out of Agra, mounted on hor&s;eback, accompanied by a few menial &s;ervants. One of the pikemen who attended him, had the in&s;olence to ride clo&s;e by his &s;ide, and to murmur in his ears concerning the lo&s;s which he him&s;elf &s;u&s;tained by &s;uch an abrupt departure. Dara was enraged at this &s;udden mark of his own fallen condition. <Q REND="inline">"Slave!" &s;aid he, "murmur not at your fate. Behold me, who but ye&s;terday commanded armies, reduced thus low, and forget your own trivial misfortunes. Behold me, who am called great as Darius," alluding to his own name, "obliged to fly by night, and be &s;ilent concerning your fate."</Q> The pikeman was &s;truck by the reproof. He &s;hrunk back, and the other &s;ervants wept. One of them was &s;o much enraged that he prepared to cha&s;ti&s;e the &s;lave; but Dara interpo&s;ing &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Forbear! the friends of the unfortunate have a right to complain in their pre|&s;ence."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to Delhi.</NOTE>Dara proceeded through night, and deceived his misfortunes  by repeating &s;ome of the elegies of Hafiz, a famous poet of Shi|raz. When he had rode two miles from Agra, he heard the noi&s;e of hor&s;emen approaching from behind. He &s;tood and drew his &s;word; but they were two private &s;oldiers, who, having perceived the prince pa&s;&s;ing through the gate of the city, took a re&s;olution to join him. They told their bu&s;ine&s;s; and Dara was prevented from thanking them by his tears. He had not advanced many
<PB N="242" REF="407">
miles, when an officer, with forty troopers joined him; and by the dawn of the morning, &s;everal men of di&s;tinction came up with him, with three hundred hor&s;e. With this retinue he con|tinued his rout to Delhi; and arrived in that city on the third day after his departure from Agra.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rai&s;es &s;orces.</NOTE>The emperor, anxious about Dara, &s;ent to his palace &s;oon after his departure. He under&s;tood that, in the confu&s;ion, he had  neglected to carry along with him his trea&s;ure. He immediately ordered fifty-&s;even mules to be loaded with gold coin, and to be &s;ent to his &s;on under the protection of a detachment of the guards. But a tribe of Hindoos, who have &s;ince made a figure under the name of Jates, having intelligence of this trea&s;ure, de|feated the party, and &s;eized the money. This was a dreadful blow to Dara. Thirty lacks of the public money were only found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the governor of Delhi; and the mer|chants and bankers would &s;ub&s;cribe to no loan, in the pre&s;ent untoward po&s;ture of the prince's affairs. The threats of military execution at la&s;t enabled him to rai&s;e con&s;iderable &s;ums, for which he gave orders on the Imperial trea&s;ury. Soldiers flocked round his &s;tandard; and he had, in a few days, the appearance of an army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurungz&ecirc;be corrupts</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be, who &s;till remained encamped near the field of  battle, was informed of every tran&s;action in Agra by his &s;pies. The greate&s;t lords, who looked upon him as the heir if not the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the empire, endeavoured to gain his favour by giving him intelligence. He found that all the hopes of Dara depended upon the army under the command of his &s;on; and he re&s;olved to gain it over to his own views. He &s;ent letters to the Raja Joy Singh, he wrote to Debere Chan, who were next in command to Solim&acirc;n Shek&ocirc;. He exaggerated, if po&s;&s;ible, the
<PB N="243" REF="408">
hopele&s;s condition of Dara; he informed them, that the army of that prince had joined his &s;tandard, that he him&s;elf had fled un|attended to Delhi, that he could not e&s;cape, as orders had been di&s;tributed through all the provinces to &s;eize him, as a public enemy. <Q REND="inline">"Shaw Jeh&acirc;n," continued Aurungz&ecirc;be, "is rendered unfit for government by age and infirmities. Your hopes, and even your &s;afety mu&s;t depend upon me; and as you value both, &s;eize Solim&acirc;n, and &s;end him to my camp."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">the army of prince Soli|m&acirc;n.</NOTE>Joy Singh, who received the fir&s;t letters from Aurungz&ecirc;be, was perplexed. His fears &s;tood again&s;t his adherence to Solim&acirc;n; his  honour rendered him aver&s;e to &s;ide with Aurungz&ecirc;be. He went to the tent of Debere; and that lord placed the letters which he al&s;o had received, in his hands. To &s;eize the prince was a mea&s;ure of peril, from his known valour; to attempt to &s;educe the army, whil&s;t he remained at its head, dangerous. They fol|lowed the middle cour&s;e as the &s;afe&s;t. When the news of the defeat of Dara arrived at the camp, about a day's march beyond Allahab&acirc;d, the prince called a council of war. He propo&s;ed to march &s;traight to Delhi; they di&s;&s;ented, and plainly told him, that they would not &s;tir from the camp till more certain advices arrived. The prince, anxious to join his father, was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure. He endeavoured to per&s;uade them; but their mea&s;ures had been taken. He applied to the army; they too were traitors, and di&s;obeyed. In&s;tead of being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t Dara, he became afraid of his own &s;afety. He re&s;olved to leave a camp where he had no authority. He, however, al|tered his opinion, and remained; but the principal officers, with their retinues, left the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shai&s;ta Chan condemned to death.</NOTE>Shai&s;ta Chan, who had commanded the right wing of Dara's army in the late battle, betrayed his tru&s;t, and retreated without

coming to blows with the rebels. He returned to Agra; and a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent him by the emperor, commanding him to appear in the pre&s;ence. His friends advi&s;ed him not to obey; but his confidence was equal to his want of faith. He tru&s;ted in his own power; he was encouraged by the vicinity of the victorious princes. He went, and &s;tood undaunted in the pre&s;ence. The emperor, offended before at his treachery, was enraged at his impudence. <Q REND="inline">"You villain," &s;aid he, "you &s;on of a villain, how could you pre&s;ume to betray my &s;on and me?"</Q> Shai&s;ta took &s;ire at the reproach. <Q REND="inline">"The name," he replied, "I confe&s;s, is not in&s;uitable to A&s;iph J&acirc;h; he inve&s;ted Shaw Jeh&acirc;n with power, by delivering the heir of the crown into his hands."</Q> The em|peror &s;tarted from his throne, and drew his &s;word. He looked furiou&s;ly around on the nobles, and cried, <Q REND="inline">"Will none of you &s;eize the traitor?"</Q> All were &s;ilent; the emperor repeated the &s;ame words. Fowl&acirc;d Chan &s;tept forth, threw Shai&s;ta to the ground, and binding his hands behind him, a&s;ked the further plea&s;ure of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n. <Q REND="inline">"Throw him headlong," &s;aid he, "from the Im|perial ba&s;tion."</Q> When they were dragging him to execution, Shai&s;ta cried out to the emperor, <Q REND="inline">"Shall you, who are the vice|gerent of God, break his laws, by &s;hedding blood on the &s;eventh day of the holy month of Ramz&acirc;n?"</Q> Shaw Jeh&acirc;n hung down his head for a moment; and then ordered him to be kept bound till the next day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;cued.</NOTE>The friends of Shai&s;ta were, in the mean time, appri&s;ed of his danger. They gathered from all quarters, and collected near ten  thou&s;and men, who came to the gate of the citadel, and perempto|rily demanded him from the emperor. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n continued ob&s;tinate during the night. In the morning, the force of the rebels had increa&s;ed; and he perceived that they were re&s;olved to come to extremities. He &s;ent for the pri&s;oner; and obliged him
<PB N="245" REF="410">
to write an order for them to di&s;per&s;e. They &s;aw through this piece of policy. They refu&s;ed to obey the commands of a man &s;ubject to another's power. Scaling ladders were actually applied to the walls; and the emperor was obliged to comply with the demands of the in&s;urgents, and to re&s;tore Shai&s;ta to his freedom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The princes appear before Agra.</NOTE>On the ninth of June, the confederate princes appeared with  their army before the capital. The city was in no condition to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege; and the gates were left open. Aurungz&ecirc;be, de|clining to enter Agra, pitched his tent in a garden without the walls. His &s;chemes were not yet ripe for execution; and he a&s;&s;umed an appearance of moderation. Mor&acirc;d lay ill of his wounds; and, being unable to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s, a fair field was left for his brother. The emperor, when the van of the rebels appeared in &s;ight, ordered the gates of the citadel, which was a place of great &s;trength, to be &s;hut. This re&s;olution alarmed Aurungz&ecirc;be. To attack his father would be a mea&s;ure of great imprudence. His health being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, his &s;ubjects &s;till looked up to him as their only lawful &s;overeign. Aurungz&ecirc;be, therefore, re&s;olved to &s;ub&s;titute art in the place of force.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurungz&ecirc;be &s;ends to his father.</NOTE>When he arrived at the gate of the city he &s;ent a tru&s;ty me&s;|&s;enger  to his father. He ordered him to touch the ground in his name, before the emperor; and to &s;ignify to him, that Aurung|z&ecirc;be &s;till retained for him the affection of a &s;on, and the loyalty of a &s;ubject; that his grief for what had happened was exceedingly great; that he lamented the ambition and evil de&s;igns of Dara, who had forced him to extremities; that he rejoiced extremely at the emperor's recovery from his indi&s;po&s;ition; and that he him&s;elf remained without the city, in humble expectation of his com|mands. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n being no &s;tranger to the dark, crafty, and intriguing di&s;po&s;ition of Aurungz&ecirc;be, received his me&s;&s;enger with

Aurungz&ecirc;be having owned the &s;uperiority of Mor&acirc;d, the prince&s;s went fir&s;t to his tent. Mor&acirc;d was of a di&s;po&s;ition that could neither conceal his hatred nor his love. He knew that Jehan&acirc;ra was inviolably attached to the intere&s;ts of his elder brother; and being at the &s;ame time fretful through the pain of his wounds, he treated her with di&s;re&s;pect, and even u&s;ed har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions. The haughty &s;pirit of Jehan&acirc;ra was impatient of in&s;ult. She called for her chair in her rage, and told him, that his brutality was equal to his crimes. The behaviour of Mor&acirc;d to his &s;i&s;ter was in&s;tantly carried to Aurungz&ecirc;be, by his &s;pies. He ran out of his tent, and &s;topt her chair. <Q REND="inline">"Will my &s;i&s;ter," he &s;aid, "leave the camp without enquiring concern|ing my health? My long ab&s;ence, Jehan&acirc;ra, has, I fear, blotted me out of the memory of my relations. Should you not deign your&s;elf to honour me with your pre&s;ence, it would have been kind to have &s;ent to me one of your meane&s;t &s;laves, to give me &s;ome accounts of my father."</Q> Having flattered her pride with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, he prevailed upon her to enter his tent, where &s;he was treated with the highe&s;t re&s;pect and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the prin|ce&s;s Jehan&acirc;ra</NOTE>To gain the confidence of Jehan&acirc;ra, he pretended the greate&s;t remor&s;e for his own behaviour.

He is mo&s;t offended at Mor&acirc;d, who has added the name of Sovereign to his other crimes. He con&s;iders Aurungz&ecirc;be as only mi&s;led by mi&s;repre&s;entation; Mor&acirc;d as an ob&s;tinate and de|termined rebel.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and Aurung|z&ecirc;be.</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be's countenance appeared lightened up with joy, dur|ing the time which &s;he employed in &s;peaking.

The fir&s;t is unpopular, on account of his pa&s;&s;ionate &s;everity among the nobility; the latter beloved, for the open hone&s;ty of his di&s;po&s;ition and his unequalled valour. As for me," continued Aurungz&ecirc;be, "I am what I &s;eem, a man devoted to the &s;ervice of God; a character little calculated to gain the favour of men. But &s;hould Dara appear to have friends to &s;upport my endeavours to regain the e&s;teem of my father, I venture to a&s;&s;ure Jehan&acirc;ra, that I will &s;ucceed or peri&s;h in the attempt."</Q> He &s;poke the&s;e words with &s;uch an appearance of emphatic &s;incerity, that the prince&s;s was overjoyed. In the openne&s;s of her heart, &s;he informed him of all the re&s;ources of her brother Dara; and &s;he mentioned the names of his principal friends. Many who pretended to be in the intere&s;t of Aurungz&ecirc;be were of the number; though they had yielded for the pre&s;ent to the bias of fortune. Without any per&s;onal affection for Dara, they affected his cau&s;e from a principle of ju&s;tice. <Q REND="inline">"I am rejoiced,

He looked upon his &s;chemes as completed; and thought he &s;aw Aurungz&ecirc;be already &s;ubmitting to his clemency. In the fulne&s;s of his heart he &s;at down and wrote a letter to Dara.

He &s;u&s;pected that it was intended for Dara; and he occupied the road toward Delhi with &s;ome faithful friends. Nahirdil had &s;carce i&s;&s;ued out of the gate of the city, when &s;ome hor&s;emen &s;urrounded and &s;eized him. He was brought to Shai&s;ta, who peru&s;ed the letter. Elevated with the di&s;covery, he immediately went to the palace of Aurungz&ecirc;be; for that prince

had now taken up his re&s;idence in the city. The &s;lave was con|fined with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy. The prince read the letter with|out emotion. He had always doubted the emperor's &s;incerity, when he promi&s;ed his forgivene&s;s to a &s;on who had ruined his armies in two battles. He, however, pro&s;ecuted his plan of deceit with indefatigable per&s;everance. To be&s;iege his father in the citadel would be an unpopular, if not a dangerous mea&s;ure. The reverence which the army &s;till had for their aged &s;overeign, would prevent them from drawing their &s;words again&s;t him. But the citadel mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the per&s;on of the father mu&s;t be placed in the hands of his ambitious &s;on; otherwi&s;e he may give his hopes to the wind.</P>

A letter from his &s;on was delivered into his hands, when he expected him in per&s;on.

It afterwards appeared, that the emperor re&s;ted his hopes on a number of robu&s;t Tartar women in the haram, whom he had armed with daggers; and who, from the &s;pirit of their country, were fit for an undertaking of boldne&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaw Jeh&acirc;n taken pri|&s;oner.</NOTE>Mahommed, contrary to his expectations, found his party &s;u|perior within the citadel. He, however, concealed his intentions.  Every thing was &s;ettled; and the emperor and his grand&s;on remained in &s;ilent expectation. News was at la&s;t brought, that Aurungz&ecirc;be had mounted his hor&s;e; and that the proce&s;&s;ion of his retinue was approaching. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was elevated with hopes; but the crafty prince, as if &s;truck with a fit of devotion, ordered his cavalcade to change their cour&s;e, and to move to|ward the tomb of Akb&acirc;r, where he intended to offer up his prayers to Heaven. When the emperor was informed of this circum&s;tance, he &s;tarted up from his throne in great rage. <Q REND="inline">"Ma|hommed," &s;aid he to the prince, "what means Aurungz&ecirc;be by this behaviour? Is he more anxious to appea&s;e the &s;pirit of his great ance&s;tor for his crimes, than the offended maje&s;ty of his own father?"</Q> Mahommed calmly replied, <Q REND="inline">"My father had never any

intention to vi&s;it the emperor." "What then brought Mahom|med hither?" retorted Shaw Jehan. "To take charge of the cita|del,"</Q> Mahommed coolly rejoined. The emperor finding him&s;elf betrayed and outwitted by his grand&s;on, bore him down with a torrent of opprobrious names. The prince, &s;eeing his pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;ing beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, retired from the pre&s;ence with the u&s;ual obei&s;ance, and left his rage to &s;ub&s;ide at lei|&s;ure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He offers the empire</NOTE>The emperor, after the heat of his pa&s;&s;ion was over, began to  reflect upon his deplorable condition. He accu&s;ed his own weak|ne&s;s more than his fortune; and he was a&s;hamed to have fallen into a &s;nare which he him&s;elf had laid. Re&s;entment and a de&s;ire of immediate revenge prevailed over every other pa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul. He &s;ent again for Mahommed.

He was ambi|tious; nor was he remarkable for his filial piety. He probably  doubted his grandfather's &s;incerity; or he did not chu&s;e to tru&s;t to propo&s;als impo&s;ed by nece&s;&s;ity. Aurungz&ecirc;be, however, e&s;caped from imminent danger through the &s;elf-denial of his &s;on. Had the emperor appeared in public at the head of his friends, Aurung|z&ecirc;be would &s;hrink from before him; and the haughty Mor&acirc;d would fly. The nobles who adhered to the intere&s;t of the brothers, and even the common &s;oldiers had repeatedly declared, that they would not draw their &s;words again&s;t a prince under who&s;e long and au&s;picious government their country had &s;o much flouri&s;hed. The fir&s;t repul&s;e received from Mahommed, did not induce the emperor to relinqui&s;h his de&s;igns. He &s;ent to him a &s;econd time; but he refu&s;ed to come to his pre&s;ence. He had &s;till the keys of the citadel in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and neither Aurungz&ecirc;be nor his &s;on cho&s;e to u&s;e force to obtain them from him. Two days pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;u&s;pence. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was ob&s;ti|nate; and Mahommed &s;tood on his guard within the walls. The fir&s;t, however, de&s;paired of gaining over the latter to his purpo&s;e; and, in the evening of the &s;econd day, he &s;ent him the keys of the fortre&s;s, and de&s;ired him to acquaint his father, that he might now come, in full &s;ecurity, to &s;ee his impri&s;oned &s;overeign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurungz&ecirc;be writes to the emperor.</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be excu&s;ed him&s;elf in a letter.

Let him, in the mean while, pa&s;s his time in that &s;erene tranquillity which is &s;uitable to his years; and when I &s;hall have di&s;abled Dara from doing further harm to the empire, I my&s;elf will come and open the gates of the citadel."</Q> This letter was only intended to deceive the people.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deceives Mor&acirc;d.</NOTE>When the prince Mahommed took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on of  the emperor, with the citadel, his father, as has been already related, was paying his devotions at the &s;hrine of the emperor Akb&acirc;r. When intelligence of his &s;on's &s;ucce&s;s was carried to him, he immediately waited upon Mor&acirc;d in his palace; and told him all the circum&s;tances of the affair. That prince, who knew that he could have no hopes from his father, was much plea&s;ed at hearing of his impri&s;onment.

His brother yielded to his impor|tunity; and the crafty prince prepared for a journey which he never intended to make.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepares to pur&s;ue Dara.</NOTE>Whil&s;t this farce was acting at Agra, advices arrived that Dara  had collected a con&s;iderable force at Delhi. Officers of di&s;tinction crowded to the prince every day from the di&s;tant provinces. Aurungz&ecirc;be pretended to be alarmed. He advi&s;ed his brother to march in per&s;on to fini&s;h the war. That prince, who was fond of action, prepared for the field; but he wanted money. The old emperor had concealed part of the Imperial trea&s;ure; Aurungz&ecirc;be had &s;ecreted the re&s;t. The army of Mor&acirc;d had not been paid for two months, and they began to murmur. The prince called together all the bankers of Agra. He offered to mortgage part of the revenue, for an immediate loan; but they refu&s;ed to give him credit. He was enraged beyond mea&s;ure, and he prepared to u&s;e force; when his brother advi&s;ed him again&s;t an act of in|ju&s;tice, and promi&s;ed to di&s;charge the arrears due to the army out of his own private fortune. Mor&acirc;d acceded to the propo&s;al, with|out ob&s;erving its fatal tendency. Aurungz&ecirc;be, by this expedient, became at once popular in the army and in the city.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Counterplot of Mor&acirc;d.</NOTE>The de&s;igns of Aurungz&ecirc;be were now too palpable not to be perceived. The friends of Mor&acirc;d had long &s;een through his  deceit; and the prince him&s;elf, though not &s;u&s;picious, was now convinced that he covered ambition under the ma&s;k of &s;anctity. The preparations for Mecca had been converted into preparations for the field. He told his brother, that he &s;till &s;tood in need of his advice. He marched in front from Agra, with a divi&s;ion of the army; and Mor&acirc;d, having created his uncle Shai&s;ta, captain-general
<PB N="255" REF="420">
of the Imperial forces, left that lord in the government of Agra, and followed Aurungz&ecirc;be. The latter prince having ar|rived at Muttra, received intelligence, that Dara had taken the rout of Lahore. He &s;topt, and waited for the arrival of his brother; who joined him the next day. The latter had, on his march, been convinced by his friends, that his brother had de&s;igns on his life; and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, as well as ambition, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to prevent the falling blow.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;carries.</NOTE>The day after Mor&acirc;d's arrival at the camp near Muttra, he invited  his brother to an entertainment. Aurungz&ecirc;be, who never had &s;u&s;|pected the open temper of Mor&acirc;d, accepted of the invitation. When the brothers &s;at at dinner, Nazir Shab&acirc;s, high-&s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, who was in the &s;ecret, entered &s;uddenly, and whi&s;|pered in Mor&acirc;d's ear, that now was the time to make a rent in a magnificent dre&s;s. Aurungz&ecirc;be, who&s;e eye could trace the thoughts in the features of the face, was alarmed at this my&s;te|rious whi&s;pering, as well as at the affected gaiety of his brother. He remained &s;ilent; and Mor&acirc;d di&s;patched Shab&acirc;s, with only de&s;iring him to wait the &s;ignal. Aurungz&ecirc;be was now convinced that there was a de&s;ign again&s;t his life.

He received his brother's congratulations with every mark of e&s;teem and affection; and the day after, he &s;ent him an invitation to come to his tent, to &s;ee &s;ome beautiful women, whom he had collected for his amu&s;ement.

in &s;inging, in dancing, and in playing upon various in|&s;truments of mu&s;ic, were, he &s;aid, beyond any thing ever &s;een in Hindo&s;tan. He enlarged upon their grace, their beauty, the elegant &s;ymmetry of their limbs. The mind of Mor&acirc;d, who was naturally a great lover of plea&s;ure, was inflamed at the de&s;crip|tion; and, contrary to the advice of all his friends, he went to his brother's quarter. On the arrival of the emperor, as Aurung|z&ecirc;be affected to call his brother, he was received by the young ladies in an inner tent. They were hand&s;ome beyond de&s;cription, and the voluptuous prince was &s;truck with a plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment at their charms.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and &s;eized</NOTE>An elegant entertainment was in the mean time &s;erved up to the &s;ound of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic.

Mor&acirc;d in a &s;hort time became intoxicated, and his brother, in&s;tead of wine, impo&s;ed upon him bum|pers of arrack. He at length fell a&s;leep on a &s;opha, in the arms of one of the ladies. Aurungz&ecirc;be had, in the mean time, given orders to &s;ome of his officers, to entertain the lords who attended Mor&acirc;d in the &s;ame voluptuous manner.

Mor&acirc;d &s;tarted up at this operation; and began to deal around his blows. The lords were terrified, and the prince began to call aloud

Nazir Shabas, his principal friend and advi&s;er, was at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;eized. He had been &s;itting under a canopy before the payma&s;|ter-general's tent; and at a &s;ignal given, the ropes of the four pole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> were at once cut; and before he could extricate him&s;elf, he was bound. The other lords who were attached to the prince, being &s;urrounded with armed men, were brought before Aurungz&ecirc;be, to whom they &s;wore allegiance. A murmur ran through the camp; but it was an ineffectual &s;ound: and the army, as if but half wakened from a dream, fell fa&s;t a&s;leep again.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sent pri&s;oner to Agra.</NOTE>The night was not far advanced when Mor&acirc;d was &s;eized  and bound.

Fearing that &s;ome attempts might be made to re&s;cue them, Aurungz&ecirc;be ordered three other elephants to be &s;ent off before them, attended by guards to elude pur&s;uers. The precaution was unnece&s;&s;ary. Mankind for&s;ook Mor&acirc;d with his fortune. In action, in the manly exerci&s;es of the field, he had many admirers; but the accompli&s;hments of his mind acquired him but few friends; and even tho&s;e whom he favoured with his genero&s;ity, were di&s;gu&s;ted at his haughtine&s;s. He fell by attempting to be artful. Had he followed, in his de&s;igns again&s;t his brother, the natural bias of his own intrepid mind, he could not have failed; but he met that crafty prince in his own province of deceit, and he was foiled.

To the joint care of Mahommed and Shai&s;ta the unfortunate Mor&acirc;d was committed; and his brother having no fears remaining in that quarter, mov|ed his camp from Muttra, and arrived at Delhi on the twenty-&s;ixth of July. Though he had not a&s;&s;umed the Imperial titles, he created Omrahs in that city, the fir&s;t of whom was Ziffer Jung, whom he dignified with the name of Chan Jeh&acirc;n. Un|der that lord he detached a divi&s;ion of his army again&s;t Dara. That prince, upon the news of the approach of Zif|fer, decamped from Sirhind, and took the rout of Lahore.

to de&s;pi&s;e magnificence.

He a&s;&s;umed upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, the pompous title of ALLUM-GIRE, OR THE CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD; being then near the clo&s;e of the fortieth year of his age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE>The means taken by Aurungz&ecirc;be to obtain the empire, were  &s;carce more ju&s;tifiable, than tho&s;e by which he &s;ecured to him&s;elf the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. Religion, the conveni|ent cloke of knavery in all countries, was the chief engine of his ambition; and, in that re&s;pect, he relied on the credulity of man|kind, to a degree of unpardonable imprudence. His &s;elf-denial and moderate profe&s;&s;ions agreed &s;o little with his actions, that it is even a&s;honi&s;hing, how any per&s;on of common reflection could have been for a moment deceived. But the vulgar give implicit faith to &s;anctity in its mo&s;t que&s;tionable form; and Mor&acirc;d, by who&s;e popularity and valour his brother overthrew the hopes of Dara, &s;u&s;pected not a duplicity to which his own &s;oul was a &s;tranger. To deceive that prince, was to &s;ecure the empire. Bearing more the appearance of an hermit him&s;elf, than that of a competitor for the throne, the army looked up to Mor&acirc;d; who being addicted beyond mea&s;ure to plea&s;ure, gave up the influence as well as the labour of bu&s;ine&s;s to his brother. Aurungz&ecirc;be, to &s;upport his ambitious views, was obliged to have recour&s;e to arts which &s;tamp his character with meanne&s;s, whil&s;t they prove the abilities of his mind.</P>

<PB N="261" REF="426">
with unmanly vanity. A &s;tranger to his own merit in tho&s;e things in which he excelled in the opinion of the world, he ar|rogated to him&s;elf prai&s;e in provinces for which nature had al|together rendered him unfit. With an open and generous di&s;po|&s;ition, he wi&s;hed to be thought artful and &s;evere; and blind to his abilities in the field, he endcavoured to carry the palm in the cabinet. To mention to him the de&s;igns of his brother, was a &s;atire upon his penetration; to &s;ugge&s;t to him caution, was, in his eyes, an accu&s;ation of his courage. He looked not around him into the conduct of others; and he abhorred every enquiry into his own. Under the &s;hadow of this carele&s;s and arrogant vanity in Mor&acirc;d, his brother fabricated at lei&s;ure his own de|&s;igns. But his exce&s;&s;ive eagerne&s;s to heighten the deceit, was the means of its being di&s;covered.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and ri&s;e</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be, however, owed not altogether his &s;ucce&s;s either to his own hypocri&s;y, or to the weakne&s;s of his brother.

The po&s;terity of tho&s;e Mo|guls, who under Baber conquered India, and &s;oldiers of fortune from Tartary and Per&s;ia, occupied the greate&s;t number of the places of profit and tru&s;t in the empire. The&s;e could not &s;ee, without envy, men of different per&s;ua&s;ions from them&s;elves, ad|mitted into the confidence of princes who &s;till profe&s;&s;ed the Ma|hommedan faith. Though &s;ilent at court, they murmured in &s;ecret; and lamented the declining &s;tate of a religion, under the au&s;pices of which they had extended their government over India. Aurungz&ecirc;be, by his rigid adherence to the tenets incul|cated in the Coran, gained the e&s;teem of all tho&s;e, who, if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, were the chains which kept together the nations of Hindo&s;tan under the hou&s;e of Timur. But the influ|ence which Aurungz&ecirc;be derived from his devotion did not, for many years, &s;ugge&s;t an ambition to a&s;pire to the empire. He only hoped, that under the cloke of &s;anctity, he might pa&s;s in &s;afety his life under any of his brothers, whom Fortune might place on the throne.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Aurung|z&ecirc;be.</NOTE>That &s;pecious appearance, which the actions of a man of religion mu&s;t wear in the eyes of the world, facilitated his  &s;chemes. In his long march from the Decan, his troops ob|&s;erved a mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline. No ravages were committed; no inju&s;tice done. When he &s;at down with his army in a field of corn, he either paid the e&s;timated value to the owners, or gave a receipt for it as a part of the revenue due to the crown. <Q REND="inline">"Though I am forced," &s;aid he, "into a war by the machinations of Dara, I cannot con&s;ider my&s;elf as in an enemy's country."</Q> When the people came to decide their differences before him, he remanded

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections</NOTE>Though the power of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n had, in a great mea&s;ure, ter|minated with the &s;ickne&s;s which rouzed his &s;ons to arms, his reign may be &s;aid to have continued till Aurungz&ecirc;be mounted  the throne near Delhi. He held the &s;cepter of India thirty &s;olar years, five months and two days; and when he was dethroned, he had arrived at the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of his age. The means by which Shaw Jeh&acirc;n obtained the empire of the Moguls, were not more ju&s;tifiable than tho&s;e which he &s;o much blamed in Au|rungz&ecirc;be. He rebelled again&s;t his father, and he permitted his relations to be &s;acrificed to his fears. When he had &s;ecured to him&s;elf the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire, he became an excellent and a humane, as well as an able prince. During his long reign, we hear of no private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, no public execu|tions, no arbitrary inju&s;tice, no oppre&s;&s;ion. Rebellion, which gene|rally ri&s;es from tyranny, was unknown; univer&s;al peace was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the undeviating ju&s;tice and clemency of the emperor. His government was vigorous without &s;everity, impartial, digni|fied, and &s;udden in its determinations. He received complaints with well-weighed caution; and never pa&s;&s;ed judgment till both parties were heard. His pervading eye travelled to the mo&s;t di&s;tant corners of his empire. He traced oppre&s;&s;ion to its mo&s;t &s;ecret retreats; and, though a lover of money, no &s;um could protect offenders from his ju&s;tice. Theft and robbery were, by his prudent regulations, eradicated from his exten&s;ive empire. The governors of the provinces were directed by an edict, to pay out of their private fortunes, the lo&s;&s;es of the &s;ubject in that way; which were a&s;certained upon oath in a court of ju&s;tice. The &s;en|tence of the judge was a warrant for the money upon the Su|bas, which they were forced immediately to pay; otherwi&s;e they were, upon complaint to the emperor, turned out of their govern|ments, and &s;everely fined.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">on the reign</NOTE>Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was hand&s;ome in his per&s;on, active in all the man|ly exerci&s;es, affable and agreeable in his conver&s;ation. He did not, like his father, de&s;cend too much from the dignity of a prince,  nor involve him&s;elf in an ob&s;cure di&s;tance and re&s;erve. Warm in his con&s;titution, he loved the company of women; though the charms of the daughter of A&s;iph, the mother of almo&s;t all his chil|dren, kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his affections during her life. His learning was &s;uch as was common among the princes of the hou&s;e of Timur; a thorough knowledge of the Arabian and Per&s;ian lan|guages, the arts of writing and &s;peaking with elegance and pro|priety, the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, of the Coran, of the laws and ca|nons of his predece&s;&s;ors, of the art of government, financiering, and of the ancient u&s;ages of the empire. Though eclip&s;ed by the extraordinary abilities of Moh&acirc;bet in war, he was a good general, and an excellent &s;oldier. His reputation was &s;o high in that re&s;pect, that he not only kept his own dominions in peace at home, but even made exten&s;ive conque&s;ts abroad. Rapid in all his mea&s;ures, he cru&s;hed rebellion before it de&s;erved the name; for to &s;u&s;pect it in any man, was with him to be prepared. A lover of plea&s;ure, without being its &s;lave, he never neglected bu&s;ine&s;s for &s;en&s;uality; and indu&s;try, wealth and commerce flou|ri&s;hed under the certain protection and vigilance of his govern|ment. Had he not fallen in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the &s;tate of rea|&s;on and &s;en&s;ibility, by the rage of that cruel di&s;order which he inherited from his father, he might have de&s;cended from the throne to his grave, and have crowned his latter days with that lu&s;tre which had covered his reign.

mu&s;t a&s;cribe his cruelty in a great mea&s;ure to nece&s;&s;ity, and the manners of his country. Ambition, among the princes of the Ea&s;t, is joined with the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion of fear. Self-pre&s;ervation drives them on to de&s;perate mea&s;ures; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion will not avail, and they mu&s;t owe their lives to their valour.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE>THE confinement of the emperor, and the &s;eizure of the per|&s;on of Mor&acirc;d, opened a fair field for the ambition of Au|rungz&ecirc;be. To di&s;gui&s;e longer his &s;erious de&s;igns on the empire,  would, from the improbability of the thing, be imprudent. He however covered his love of power with profe&s;&s;ions of nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;till lamented the occa&s;ion which had burdened his head with a crown. This &s;pecious conduct, though too obvious in its de|&s;ign to deceive, derived an advantage from its mode&s;t appear|ance; and men forgot his deviations from virtue, in the opinion that he was a&s;hamed of his crimes. Having &s;ubdued the pa&s;&s;ion of vanity before he gave the rein to ambition, he appeared in&s;en|&s;ible of his own exaltation. His humility &s;eemed to encrea&s;e up|on the throne to &s;uch a degree, that even tho&s;e who could not ap|prove of his mea&s;ures, were at a lo&s;s to what they ought to a&s;cribe his conduct. Aver&s;e to plea&s;ure, and contemning pomp and magni|ficence, the obvious inducements to the &s;eizing of the &s;cepter were
<PB N="270" REF="434">
wanting to Aurungz&ecirc;be; but his active mind found, in its own vigour, a kind of right to command mankind.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solim&acirc;n</NOTE>The new emperor had &s;carce mounted the throne near Delhi, when he was alarmed with intelligence of the march of Solim&acirc;n,  by the &s;kirts of the northern mountains, to join his father Dara at Lahore. We lo&s;t &s;ight of that prince in the mid&s;t of his mutinous army, near Allahab&acirc;d. The principal nobles who had attended him in his &s;ucce&s;sful expedition again&s;t Suja, de&s;erted his &s;tandard at the fir&s;t news of his father's defeat. The confinement of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n deprived him of more of his followers; but a number, &s;uf|ficient to de&s;erve the name of an army, &s;till remained in his camp. Though bold and unconcerned in action, Solim&acirc;n was &s;ubject to political fears. The news of repeated misfortunes came daily from every quarter. He became perplexed and undeci&s;ive: various expedients pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his view, but he could fix on none. His fir&s;t re&s;olution was to return to Bengal; but, dubious of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Suja with a reduced and di&s;pirited army, he dropt that de&s;ign, and gave him&s;elf up again to wavering &s;chemes. He had none to advi&s;e him; and his own mind afforded no re|&s;ource in di&s;tre&s;s. When intelligence of the march of the confe|derate princes from Agra arrived in his camp, he thought of &s;ur|pri&s;ing the capital, and, by relea&s;ing his grandfather, to add the weight of that monarch's name to his declining cau&s;e. He de|camped, but his evil &s;tars prevailed. He changed his cour&s;e, and directed his march to Lahore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">de&s;erted</NOTE>The undeci&s;ive mea&s;ures of Solim&acirc;n were known to his troops. They began to de&s;pi&s;e the authority of one who could not per&s;e|vere  in any plan. All di&s;cipline became relaxed. The inde|pendance of the &s;oldier ro&s;e with his contempt of his general. Re|gularity was lo&s;t in licentiou&s;ne&s;s; confu&s;ion, rapine and in&s;olence
<PB N="271" REF="435">
prevailed; and the whole army, in&s;tead of obeying the prince, placed a merit in their not de&s;erting his cau&s;e. That intrepidity and firmne&s;s which was nece&s;&s;ary to the occa&s;ion, no longer re|mained in Solim&acirc;n. His &s;tandard had been left by tho&s;e whom he thought his be&s;t friends, and a melancholy di&s;tru&s;t prevailed in his mind. To correct the licence of the &s;oldiery, was to lo&s;e their &s;upport. He permitted them, with a vain hope of conciliating their affections, to ravage the country at large. But when they had loaded them&s;elves with &s;poil, they de&s;erted in whole &s;quadrons, to &s;ecure their wealth as home, and to avoid the doubtful chance of war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">by his army;</NOTE>De&s;titute of all authority, the prince moved along, &s;ullen and  &s;ilent, at the head of an army converted into a mob of banditti. He i&s;&s;ued out no orders, under a certainty of their not being obeyed; and he even looked with indifference on the gradual decline in the number of his followers. Every morning pre&s;ented to his eyes at a di&s;tance, whole &s;quadrons that had quitted his camp in the night. There only remained at la&s;t four thou&s;and mi&s;erable wretches, who had &s;uffered them&s;elves to be robbed of their booty. Fear, and not attachment, kept the&s;e round the &s;tandard of Solim&acirc;n. Their rapine had converted the whole country into an enemy, and there was no longer any &s;afety in de&s;ertion. They, however, marked their march with ruin, and covered their rear with the &s;moke of villages, which they had plundered and &s;et on fire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">takes</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be received certain intelligence of the de&s;tructive rout of Solim&acirc;n through the countries of Shinw&acirc;ra and Muchlis-pour.  He detached Fidai Chan with a con&s;iderable force to interrupt his march. Shai&s;ta, who had been left in the government of Agra, was ordered with troops, by a different rout, to prevent the e&s;cape of the prince by the road through which he had come. He was in no condition to cope with either of tho&s;e lords. He turned his
<PB N="272" REF="436">
march to the north, and entered the almo&s;t impervious country of Serenag&ucirc;r, where the Ganges i&s;&s;ues from the mountains into the plains of India. Pirti Singh, the Raja, received the unfortunate fugitive with kindne&s;s and re&s;pect. He &s;ent his own troops to guard the pa&s;&s;e&s;, and permitted the forces of Solim&acirc;n to encamp in his valleys, to recover from the fatigues of a tedious march. Aurungz&ecirc;be, upon receiving advices of the e&s;cape of the prince, recalled Fidai to the Imperial camp, and ordered Shai&s;ta to his go|vernment of Agra.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">refuge</NOTE>Safe in the ho&s;pitality of the prince of Serinag&ucirc;r, Solim&acirc;n re|mained &s;hut up in a &s;ecluded country. The mountains, which  protected him from the enemy, prevented him from hearing of the fate of his friends. He became anxious and thoughtful, and di&s;covered neither plea&s;ure nor amu&s;ement in the rural &s;ports pur|&s;ued by others through the romantic vallies which formed the do|minions of the Raja. He loved to walk alone; to dive into the thicke&s;t woods; to mix his complaints with the murmur of tor|rents, which, falling from a thou&s;and rocks, filled the whole coun|try with an agreeable noi&s;e. One day, as the prince wandered from his party, he entered a narrow valley formed by one of the &s;treams which fall headlong from the impa&s;&s;able mountains that environ Serinag&ucirc;r. In the center of the valley there &s;tood a mound almo&s;t covered with trees; through the branches of which appeared undi&s;tinctly what &s;eemed an Indian pagod. The &s;tream, divided into two, &s;urrounded the mound, and appeared to have worn away the foundations of the rock, on which the building &s;tood; which circum&s;tance rendered it inacce&s;&s;ible on every &s;ide. Solim&acirc;n, plea&s;ed with this romantic &s;cene, rode forward, and found that what he had mi&s;taken for a temple, was a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure belonging to the Raja. Thither that prince often retired, with a few attendants, to enjoy the company of &s;ome Ca&s;hmirian women of exqui&s;ite beauty. Some of the&s;e were walking on the terrace
<PB N="273" REF="437">
when Solim&acirc;n approached. He was &s;truck with their per&s;ons; but he in&s;tantly retired.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in Serinag&ucirc;r.</NOTE>When he returned to the re&s;idence of the Raja, he mentioned  his adventure to that prince. His countenance was &s;uddenly over|ca&s;t, and he remained for &s;ome time &s;ilent. He at length &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"All my dominions have I given up to Solim&acirc;n, yet he has in|truded upon one little valley which I re&s;erved for my&s;elf."</Q> So|lim&acirc;n excu&s;ed his conduct by his ignorance; but though the Raja pretended to be &s;atisfied, there appeared from that day forward a manife&s;t change in his behaviour. He became cold and di&s;tant; and he was di&s;contented and agitated when the fugitive prince came before him. Jealou&s;y, however, was not the cau&s;e of this alteration. Aurungz&ecirc;be had applied to him through his emi&s;|&s;aries; and the honour of that prince contended with his avarice. Solim&acirc;n became unea&s;y at the doubtful gloom which hung on his countenance. He encamped, with his few followers, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Raja's re&s;idence; and he began to watch nar|rowly the conduct of a prince, whom he &s;till called his protector and friend.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Irre&s;olution</NOTE>When Solim&acirc;n entered the mountains of Serinag&ucirc;r, he di&s;patch|ed  a me&s;&s;enger with the news of his misfortunes to his father Da|ra. That prince was encamped, with a con&s;iderable army, on the banks of the Suttuluz. When he received the letters of his &s;on, he &s;hut him&s;elf up in his tent, and gave way to melancholy reflec|tions on his own misfortunes. The impri&s;onment of his father was an event, which, as it was expected, did not &s;urprize him; but the de&s;ertion of the victorious army under his &s;on, was a &s;e|vere &s;troke to his declining fortunes.

&s;hut up within impervious mountains; and the enemy had occu|pied all the pa&s;&s;es. Dara was left to his own re&s;ources, and they failed, in the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of his mind. He reflected on the pa&s;t with regret; he looked forward to the future with fear. Agitated by various pa&s;&s;ions, he could &s;ix upon no determined ex|pedient to extricate him&s;elf from misfortune; and a panic began to &s;eize his troops from the irre&s;olute undeci&s;ivene&s;s of his con|duct.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Dara.</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be, who had his &s;pies in the camp of Dara, was no  &s;tranger to the &s;ituation of his mind. To add to his panic, he marched from Karnal on the fifteenth of Augu&s;t, and directed his cour&s;e toward Lahore. Dara, who had remained irre&s;olute on the banks of the Suttuluz, decamped, upon the news of the enemy's ap|proach, with precipitation. The advanced guard of Aurungz&ecirc;be pa&s;&s;ed the river without oppo&s;ition; and Dara &s;at down with his army behind the Bea, on the road to Lahore, to which city he him|&s;elf &s;oon after retired, leaving the troops under the conduct of Daood Chan, an able and experienced officer. Dara had great re|&s;ources in the provinces behind Lahore. The governors had &s;till remained faithful to the old emperor; the revenues of the pre|ceding year had not been paid; and the prince found a con&s;ider|able &s;um in the Imperial trea&s;ury at Lahore. He &s;oon rai&s;ed twen|ty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and his activity had begun to change the a&s;pect of his affairs. But he had hitherto been un&s;ucce&s;sful: and he judged of the future by the pa&s;t. He was di&s;turbed by the news of the approach of a part of the army of Aurungz&ecirc;be, who, hav|ing con&s;tructed a bridge on the Suttuluz, were on full march to the Bea.</P>

and redoubts, with a firm a&s;&s;urance of &s;topping the progre&s;s of the enemy. The rainy &s;ea&s;on was now come on, and he was under no apprehen&s;ions of not being able to keep the enemy for five months at bay. The northern provinces might, in the mean time, furni&s;h Dara with an army of hardy &s;oldiers. Moh&acirc;|bet, who commanded in Cabul, was in his intere&s;t; and he rivalled his predece&s;&s;or of the &s;ame name in his abilities in war. But the evil genius of Dara prevailed. He &s;ent orders to Daood to quit his po&s;t. That officer was a&s;toni&s;hed: he &s;ent a remon&s;trance again&s;t the mea&s;ure to the prince, and the jealous mind of Dara &s;u&s;pected his fidelity.

Dara embraced him with tears, and began to retreat. The army, di&s;couraged at the apparent irre|&s;olution of their commander, began to fear for them&s;elves.

His army de|&s;erted him; and he even de&s;erted his army. He changed his clothes, he threw off every mark of di&s;tinction, and hurried for|ward to Patna like a private man. He feared no enemy; but he was afraid of his friends. When Fortune had for&s;aken him, he hoped not to retain their faith; for to deliver him to Aurung|z&ecirc;be would not only procure their &s;afety, but advance their inte|re&s;t. The &s;un was &s;carce up, when Aurungz&ecirc;be detached ten thou|&s;and hor&s;e, under his &s;on Mahommed, in pur&s;uit of his brother. The enemy were &s;o much di&s;&s;ipated, that &s;ew were &s;lain. The in&s;tructions of the prince were to follow Suja. He arrived at Patna, and the unfortunate prince &s;led to Mongeer; hoping to derive from walls that &s;afety which he could not command in the field. His courage, however, for&s;ook him not in his di&s;tre&s;s.

He a&s;&s;umed no merit to him&s;elf, he even gave up that of his army, and attributed his &s;ucce&s;s to Providence. He involved Heaven in his quarrel with his brothers; and made it the partner of his own guilt. This religious oration was received with bur&s;ts of applau&s;e. Mankind are in all ages and nations &s;uper&s;titious; and the bare profe&s;&s;ion of &s;ancity hides the blacke&s;t crimes from their eyes. Aurungz&ecirc;be, however, did not forget his temporal affairs in his devotion. An|xious for the reduction of Bengal, and for an end of the war with Suja, he detached a large body of hor&s;e under Meer Jumla, to reinforce Mahommed, whil&s;t he him&s;elf took the rout of the ca|pital.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara flies to Bicker.</NOTE>DARA having fled from Moult&acirc;n, took the rout of Bicker, beyond the Indus. The Imperiali&s;ts were clo&s;e at his heels. His army fell off gradually in his flight. His affairs  were de&s;perate, and their attachment gave way to per&s;onal &s;afety. Four thou&s;and &s;till adhered to their colours, with which number Dara encamped near Bicker, having garri&s;oned the place, and &s;ubmitted it to the command of a faithful friend. He had &s;carce pitched his tents, when the enemy came in &s;ight. Though worn-out with fatigue, he was obliged to fly. He found boats by accident, and cro&s;&s;ed the Indus with all his followers. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore &s;tood the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Sicar. Struck with the hard fate of Dara, the governor opened the gates. But it was not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the prince to &s;hut him&s;elf up within walls; which at be&s;t could only protract misfortune. He re|inforced the garri&s;on with a part of his troops; and left &s;ome valuable effects under the protection of the governor.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="455">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meditates to retire to Per&s;ia,</NOTE>Di&s;incumbered, he betook him&s;elf to the open field, before he had even thought of the quarter to which he &s;hould direct his cour&s;e. He wandered away in a melancholy mood. His faith|ful  adherents, for only tho&s;e who&s;e attachment to his per&s;on overcame their own fears were now in his train, followed &s;ilently the path of a ma&s;ter whom they loved. Having marched a few miles, the prince came to the place where the road parted into two; the one leading to Tatta, the other toward the Per&s;ian province of Chora&s;&s;an. Starting from his reverie, he &s;tood for &s;ome time irre&s;olute. On the one &s;ide there was ap|parent ruin; on the other, a certainty of per&s;onal &s;afety. But glory was blended with di&s;grace in the fir&s;t; in the latter there was nothing but ob&s;curity and di&s;honour. When he weighed the&s;e things in his mind, the chariots in which were his women arrived. His perplexity increa&s;ed. The de&s;art toward Per&s;ia was exten&s;ive and unho&s;pitable; on the &s;ide of India, his own misfortunes mu&s;t overwhelm his family. He could not decide; and a melancholy &s;ilence prevailed around.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">but changes his cour&s;e to Tatta.</NOTE>The favourite Sultana, &s;eeing the undeci&s;ivene&s;s of Dara, at length put an end to his doubts. <Q REND="inline">"Can the fir&s;t of the race of  Timur," &s;he &s;aid, "he&s;itate in this moment of di&s;tre&s;s? There is danger, but there may be al&s;o a throne on one &s;ide; but a frightful &s;olitude, and the cold reception given to fugitive princes by &s;trangers, threaten from the other. If Dara cannot decide, I, who am the daughter of Purv&ecirc;z, will decide for my&s;elf. This hand &s;hall prevent me, by death, from di&s;honour. The de|&s;cendant of the immortal Timur &s;hall not grace the haram of the race of Sheick Se&s;i!"</Q> The features of the prince were at once lighted up into a kind of mournful joy. He bur&s;t into tears; and, without uttering a word, &s;purred forward his hor&s;e toward Tatta. He had not remained many days in that city, when he
<PB N="292" REF="456">
received advices that a con&s;iderable detachment of the enemy was arrived within a few miles of the place. He evacuated Tatta, cro&s;&s;ed the Indus, and fled toward the capital of Guzerat. The enemy laid a bridge of boats over the river; and were preparing to pur&s;ue the fugitive, when unexpected orders arrived for them to repair with all expedition to join the Imperial army, in full march again&s;t Suja.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cro&s;&s;es the de&s;art.</NOTE>The removal of the Imperial troops procured a happy re&s;pite  for Dara; but it was but a tran&s;ient gleam of Fortune, who had re&s;olved to continue her frowns. The road of the prince lay partly through burning &s;ands, de&s;titute of water; partly through abrupt mountains, covered with impervious woods, the haunts of bea&s;ts of prey. His people were parched with thir&s;t; his very camels died of fatigue. His unfortunate women were ju&s;t ex|piring for want of water, when the prince, who ranged the &s;oli|tudes far and wide, lighted on a &s;pring. He encamped near it; and having refre&s;hed his attendants, arrived next day on the bor|ders of the territories of the Raja's J&acirc;m and Bah&acirc;ra, which lay contiguous to each other in his rout. They received him with ho&s;pitality; but they declined to embrace his cau&s;e. They were the natural enemies of the hou&s;e of Timur, who had, often from views of conque&s;t, penetrated into their almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible country. When per&s;ua&s;ion failed, Dara endeavoured to work upon the pride of J&acirc;m. He propo&s;ed an alliance between his &s;on Sipper Shek&ocirc;, the con&s;tant attendant of his misfortunes, and the daugh|ter of the Raja. The match did not take place. The few Mogul nobles who adhered to him, were &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfied with the propo&s;al, on account of its inequality, that it was laid a&s;ide; and Dara proceeded to Ahmedab&acirc;d.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="457">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">and arrives in Guzerat.</NOTE>Shaw Naw&acirc;z, who&s;e two daughters were married to Aurung|z&ecirc;be and Mor&acirc;d, had been left by the latter in the government of Guzerat, and kept his re&s;idence in Ahmedab&acirc;d. When Mo|r&acirc;d  was &s;eized, Aurungz&ecirc;be &s;ent a new commi&s;&s;ion to Shaw Na|w&acirc;z, which that lord received, and governed his province in the name of the new emperor. He prepared to oppo&s;e Dara with all his forces. The match was unequal, and the prince, hemmed in with misfortunes on every &s;ide, began to de&s;pair. He, how|ever, re&s;olved to carry no longer round the empire a life obnoxi|ous to mi&s;ery. He advanced with his few attendants; and, as the la&s;t re&s;ort, wrote a letter to the younger daughter of Shaw Naw&acirc;z, who was the wife of Mor&acirc;d, and had been left with her father when the prince marched toward Agra. He recounted his own misfortunes; and compared them with tho&s;e of her hu&s;band. <Q REND="inline">"The enemy of both is one," &s;aid he: "if the memory of the unfortunate Mor&acirc;d &s;till lives in the brea&s;t of his wife, &s;he will per&s;uade her father to favour Dara, who is oppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame untoward fate!"</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gains over the gover|nor.</NOTE>The prince&s;s, who had mourned ince&s;&s;antly for the misfortunes of her lord, whom &s;he loved to di&s;traction, bur&s;t into a flood of  tears at the reception of the letter. She gra&s;ped at the &s;hadow of hope for her hu&s;band's relea&s;ement, which was offered by a prince overwhelmed by his own bad fortune. She threw her&s;elf at the feet of her father; her tears &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her voice; but &s;he looked up to him with that forcible eloquence of eyes, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t from beauty in di&s;tre&s;s. She placed the letter of Dara in his hands. He read it with emotion; and turned away in &s;ilence. She followed him on her knees, hold|ing the &s;kirt of his robe. <Q REND="inline">"Is not my daughter," &s;aid he, "al|ready &s;ufficiently wretched? Why does &s;he wi&s;h to involve her father in the irretrievable mi&s;ery which has overtaken her lord?
<PB N="294" REF="458">
But &s;he will have it &s;o&mdash;and prudence mu&s;t give way to pity."</Q> He ordered the gates to be thrown open; and the prince&s;s, in an ec&s;ta&s;y of joy, &s;ent accounts of her &s;ucce&s;s to Dara.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rai&s;es an army.</NOTE>The prince could &s;carce believe his own eyes, when he received the letter of the wife of Mor&acirc;d. A gleam of hope came in upon his  misfortunes. He entered Ahmedab&acirc;d; and the governor re|ceived him with the highe&s;t di&s;tinction and re&s;pect. He gave to the prince about one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds in money, together with jewels to a great amount, to contribute to rai&s;e troops. This new life to the affairs of Dara, rendered him active in his preparations for war. In a few weeks he found him&s;elf at the head of a con&s;iderable army. He in the mean time received letters from the Maraja, who, with his native troops, was on his march with Aurungz&ecirc;be to attack Suja. That prince acquainted him of his de&s;ign of de&s;erting the new emperor in the action; and we have already &s;een that he kept his promi&s;e. He conjured Dara to ha&s;ten his march to &s;upport him in his intended defection. The advice was good; but the evil genius of Dara prevailed. He delayed, that he might aug|ment his forces; and lo&s;t the golden opportunity of re&s;toring his affairs by an act of boldne&s;s and intrepidity. Suja was, in the mean time, defeated; and Aurungz&ecirc;be turned his whole force to|ward the &s;trom which was brewing in the We&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches to|ward Agra.</NOTE>The de&s;ertion of the Maraja had &s;pread news of the defeat and death of Aurungz&ecirc;be to every corner of the empire. The  agreeable intelligence came to Dara. He in&s;tantly marched to|ward Agra, to &s;eize the capital before the arrival of Suja, who was &s;aid to have conquered. In three days, the unfortunate prince was undeceived. Letters from different quarters brought him the particulars of the action, and of the complete victory obtained by
<PB N="295" REF="459">
his greate&s;t foe. He was again thrown into perplexity. To proceed with &s;o &s;mall a force was imprudent; to retreat, ruinous to his reputation. He had built his la&s;t hopes on his army; to retire, was to lo&s;e them by de&s;ertion. Many Europeans were in his camp. He had gained them by large promi&s;es; and they na|turally loved that impartiality which he &s;hewed indi&s;criminately to men of merit of all nations. His artillery was upon the be&s;t footing; and he was not de&s;titute of able engineers. His &s;oldiers, for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ting of the troops of the empire &s;ta|tioned on the frontiers, were habituated to action. But they were too few in number; and their leader was de&s;tined for mis|fortune.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Turns toward the domi|nions of the Maraja,</NOTE>The Maraja, after plundering the Imperial camp, declared his intentions of marching to Guzerat with the &s;poil. Dara halted to  take him up by his way. But the Indian had no &s;erious inten|tions of a&s;&s;i&s;ting effectually any branch of the hou&s;e of Ti|mur. An enthu&s;ia&s;t in his own religion, he con&s;idered all Ma|hommedans as his natural enemies. He abetted none of the princes through choice. He &s;tudied to add fuel to the flame which raged between them, and to derive advantage from their di&s;&s;entions. He hoped to find that freedom and independence in their weak|ne&s;s, which he could never expect from their favour and power. Under the influence of the&s;e political principles, he &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided to meet Dara. He took the rout of Mar|w&acirc;r, to lodge his booty in his own dominions in &s;afety. He, however, wrote letters to the prince, to advance to his borders, where he would join him with a recruited army. Dara accord|ingly marched toward Meirta, at which place he encamped with his forces, in daily expectations of the junction of the Ma|raja, who was collecting his forces at the capital of his domi|nions.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="460">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">who is gained over by Au|rungz&ecirc;be,</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be was, in the mean time, alarmed at the great pre|parations of the Maraja. He &s;aw danger in his defection; and he had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual art and addre&s;s. He wrote to him a  letter. He acquainted him, That the oppo&s;ition given to his fortune at the battle of Ugein, had long &s;ince been blotted out of his memory, as it was the re&s;ult of the Maraja's opi|nion in favour of Dara; that his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his government, while yet his brothers were in the field, was a conduct which entitled him to favour; but that his late de&s;ertion in battle, and his &s;ub&s;equent attack upon the Imperial baggage, could not be forgot, though it might be forgiven. <Q REND="inline">"The love of public tranquillity, however," continues Aurungz&ecirc;be, "has expelled from my brea&s;t every wi&s;h of revenge. It is therefore your intere&s;t, to withdraw your foot from the circle of Dara's misfor|tunes. That you &s;hould join my &s;tandard, I neither expect nor wi&s;h. I cannot tru&s;t again your faith; and my own force is &s;ufficient to overthrow my enemies. You may therefore look from your own country, an unconcerned &s;pectator of the war; and to re|ward you for your neutrality, the government of Guzerat &s;hall be added to that of your hereditary dominions."</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and de&s;erts Dara.</NOTE>The letter had the intended effect on the Maraja. He pre|ferred  the proffered advantage to the gratitude of Dara, who&s;e fortunes wore &s;uch a doubtful a&s;pect. He broke off his corre&s;pond|ence with that prince, at the very time that he was buoyed up with the hopes of the junction of a great army with his own forces. A &s;tranger to the motive of the Hindoo, he &s;ent his &s;on Sipper Shek&ocirc; to endeavour to prevail upon him to throw off his inactivity. The young prince was received at his capital with di&s;tinction and ho&s;pitality. He was, however, di&s;|appointed in his views. The Maraja would give no &s;atisfac|tory an&s;wer; and the prince returned to his father, who was
<PB N="297" REF="461">
greatly di&s;concerted by this new misfortune. He, however, re|&s;olved to he&s;itate no longer with his fate. He decamped and marched in a direct line for Agra; and arrived at Ajmere, about eight days journey from that capital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dara forti&s;ies</NOTE>In the neighbourhood of Ajmere, the high-road to the capi|tal  pa&s;&s;es between two &s;teep hills, each of which forms the point of an impa&s;&s;able ridge of mountains, which &s;tretch far into the country on both &s;ides, and &s;eparate the kingdom of Guzerat from the re&s;t of Hindo&s;tan. Dara halted with his army in this pa&s;s. His high opinion of the European mode of war, which he imbib|ed from the Engli&s;h, French and Portugue&s;e in his &s;ervice, had rendered that prince fond of entrenchments. He had con&s;idered the appearance of &s;ecurity, more than the movements of the hu|man mind: for armies often take entrenchments in no other light than as a proof of the &s;uperiority of the enemy. He threw up lines from hill to hill in his front, and &s;trengthened them with artillery. Aurungz&ecirc;be, in the mean time, marched with an army to &s;top his progre&s;s; and arrived with great expedition in the neighbourhood of Ajmere. When he came in &s;ight of the en|trenchments, he ordered his army to encamp; and he him&s;elf rode out to reconnoitre the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">him&s;elf at Ajmere.</NOTE>Nothing could equal his a&s;toni&s;hment when he viewed,  through a &s;py-gla&s;s, the po&s;ition of his brother. The &s;trength of the works was inconceivable; in&s;tead of a common entrench|ment the prince had fortified him&s;elf with a &s;trong rampire, defended by ba&s;tions, a deep ditch and a double row of pali|&s;adoes, which extended &s;ix miles acro&s;s a valley. Aurungz&ecirc;be was perplexed beyond mea&s;ure. He knew not how to act. An a&s;&s;ault was evidently impracticable; to do nothing would derogate from that high opinion which he had already e&s;tabli&s;hed in the minds of the people. Every day would add to Dara's influence
<PB N="298" REF="462">
and party; and mankind, who always &s;ide with the unfortunate, would attribute to ability what was the gift of chance. He called a council of the nobles. They differed in their opinions; much time was &s;pent in argument without coming to a deci&s;ive mea&s;ure. They at la&s;t agreed upon an expedient. They knew that the &s;pirit of Dara was impatient of in&s;ult; and they advi&s;ed the emperor to draw out his forces, and to offer battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aurungz&ecirc;be of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ers battle.</NOTE>In compliance with the advice of his nobles, he formed his line on the 23d of March 1659, and advanced with his artil|lery  within cannon-&s;hot of the camp. Dara continued with|in his lines; and Aurungz&ecirc;be began to fortify him&s;elf under the enemy's fire. He continued the work the whole night, and covered his men before day-light appeared, notwith&s;tanding his brother had &s;allied thrice during that time. The &s;un was &s;carce ri&s;en, when Debere, and &s;ome other nobles, i&s;&s;ued out of the camp, and advanced on full &s;peed with five thou&s;and hor&s;e near the lines; hoping, by in&s;ulting him, to draw Dara from his lines. They paid dear for their temerity. The artillery of the enemy being well &s;erved, galled the a&s;&s;ailants &s;o much, that they retreated in di&s;order, and were glad to &s;helter them&s;elves behind their own lines. Things remained in this doubtful &s;ituation for &s;everal days. The army of Dara, having the country in their rear open, were in no want of provi&s;ions; and were, therefore, under no nece&s;&s;ity of retreating; and it was impo&s;&s;ible, without a long &s;iege, to overcome their almo&s;t impregnable lines.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;tratagem</NOTE>Fortune, who never for&s;ook Aurungz&ecirc;be, relieved his anxiety upon this occa&s;ion. A petty Indian prince, who commanded three  thou&s;and of his native infantry in the Imperial army, informed him&s;elf of a narrow and &s;teep path, by which men, accu&s;tomed to climb, might a&s;cend the mountain on the right of Dara's lines. He communicated his information to the emperor, who was over|joyed

at the di&s;covery. He made large promi&s;es to the Raja, &s;hould he gain, with a party, the &s;ummit of the mountain, with|out alarming the enemy. Should he be &s;o fortunate as to &s;ucceed in the attempt, he was ordered to make a &s;ignal to the emperor from that &s;ide of the mountain which was covered from Dara. When night came on, he marched with his troops. Having encountered many difficulties, he a&s;cended the mountain, and the appointed &s;ignal was ready to be &s;hewn by the dawn of day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to deceive</NOTE>Aurungz&ecirc;be never re&s;ted his hopes upon the &s;ucce&s;s of a &s;ingle  &s;cheme. He had, during the night, planned the ruin of his bro|ther's affairs, by a more fatal &s;troke of policy than the &s;tratagem of the Raja. Debere Chan, and the Indian prince, Joy Singh, had, at the beginning of the war, adhered with warmth to the intere&s;ts of Dara. Under the prince Solim&acirc;n, they had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in the defeat of Suja, and the reduction of Bengal. Yielding to the pre&s;&s;ure of the times, and to the in|trigues of Aurungz&ecirc;be, they de&s;erted, as has been already related, the colours of Solim&acirc;n; and ruined all the hopes which the unfortunate Dara derived from the victorious army under his &s;on. To the&s;e chiefs the emperor applied with much addre&s;s. He promi&s;ed largely; and he mixed threats with his proffered favour. He at length prevailed upon them to write an in&s;idious letter to Dara, to the following purpo&s;e:</P>

pre&s;ented to us by the prince, he attributed the victory over Suja to our conduct and valour. The emperor was partial in our favour; but we pre&s;ume to hope, we de&s;erved a part of his prai&s;e. When the news of the defeat of our prince, and of the impri&s;onment of the king of kings, came to our ears, we thought our&s;elves alone amid&s;t the victorious armies of our foes. What could we do? Our loyalty remained, but nece&s;&s;ity was near. The times left us no choice, and we were forced to &s;ubmit. We have ever &s;ince been dragged along, the unwilling &s;laves of Aurungz&ecirc;be. But now Fortune has returned to the thre&s;hold which leads to the pre&s;ence of Dara. The acce&s;&s;ion of his faith|ful &s;ervants to his power, though not nece&s;&s;ary to his affairs, will bring them to a more &s;peedy conclu&s;ion. When, therefore, day-light &s;hall appear, let the gate of the camp be opened to receive us; that we may have an opportunity of regaining, by our merit, the favour, of which we have been deprived by nece&s;&s;ity.

Shaw Naw&acirc;z in vain remon&s;trated to him, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that there was danger in con&s;iding in their &s;incerity. Dara was al|ways aver&s;e to advice; and now he was rendered blind by the hopes of gaining &s;uch powerful chiefs to his party. He was ob&s;tinate; and determined to ri&s;que all on the faith of men who had, a few months before, betrayed his &s;on. He gave po&s;itive orders, that in the morning, that gate of the camp which looked toward the enemy &s;hould be thrown open, to receive the expected fu|gitives. He, at the &s;ame time, i&s;&s;ued directions to all the officers,

that care &s;hould be taken not to fire upon them as they advanced. Shaw Naw&acirc;z was highly di&s;&s;atisfied; Mahommed Sherif, who commanded the forces, was a&s;toni&s;hed. The orders were per|emptory, and they mu&s;t be obeyed. They, however, re&s;olved to &s;tand upon their guard; and when morning came, they po&s;ted them&s;elves, with &s;everal &s;quadrons, without the lines; giving orders, at the &s;ame time, that all the troops in the camp &s;hould &s;tand to their arms.</P>

The &s;un was not yet up, when he ordered Debere to i&s;&s;ue forth from his right, and Joy Singh from his left, at the head of their troops, and to advance on full &s;peed toward the camp. The&s;e officers accordingly ru&s;hed forth; and Aurungz&ecirc;be, to carry on the deceit, began to fire with his artillery, but with powder only, on the pretended de&s;erters.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The misfor|tunes of Dara.</NOTE>The grief of Dara for his defeat was great, but it was not equal  to his a&s;toni&s;hment. The misfortune, though dreadful, was unexpected, and by the &s;udden ill prevented the fear. It was, however, &s;ucceeded by mi&s;ery, and unequalled di&s;tre&s;s. The un|fortunate prince fled to the capital of Guzerat. But the governor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">hom he left in the place, &s;hut the gates again&s;t his lord. He &s;at down in &s;ilence, and knew not whither to fly. His friends became his greate&s;t enemies. Two thou&s;and Mahrattors &s;till ad|hered to the unhappy prince. When they heard of the me&s;&s;age of the governor, they de&s;paired of the affairs of Dara, and added their own cruelty to his misfortunes. In a pretence of having large arrears of their pay due to them, they fell upon his baggage, and plundered it in his pre&s;ence. Some ca&s;kets of jewels were &s;aved by his women; for even in that &s;ea&s;on of licence and di&s;order, their per&s;ons were &s;acred from barbarity it&s;elf. This outrage was committed in the night. When day-light appeared, the robbers, as if a&s;hamed of their conduct, fled with their &s;poil. A few only of the lowe&s;t menial &s;ervants remained. Every thing was re|moved from the field. The mi&s;erable tents, which he had col|lected in his flight, were carried away; and nothing was left but a few old &s;creens of canva&s;s, which covered the Sultana and her female &s;laves from the public eye. The di&s;tre&s;s of the prince may be imagined, but cannot be de&s;cribed. He walked about in &s;eeming di&s;traction; and the &s;ad complaints of the women from behind their wretched covering, drew tears from the eyes of the few &s;ervants who &s;till adhered to their unhappy lord.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flies to the de&s;art.</NOTE>The pre&s;&s;ure of his misfortunes at length awakened Dara from a melancholy reverie, in which he had &s;trayed from the place where his camp had &s;tood. He returned in manife&s;t di&s;order; and &s;eemed  to que&s;tion every one with his eyes, about the means of moving to &s;ome place of &s;afety. A few bea&s;ts of burden were collected by his &s;ervants; and the robbers, who had de&s;erted and plundered his camp, had left to him the two elephants which he had brought from Ajmere. On the&s;e he placed all the effects which had e&s;caped the ravages of the Mahrattors; and a few oxen found in a neigh|bouring field, dragged &s;lowly away in covered carriages his wo|men. The prince him&s;elf, with his &s;on Cipper Shek&ocirc;, attended them on hor&s;eback, with an ill-mounted retinue of two or three hundred &s;ervants and faithful adherents. He turned his face to the frightful &s;olitudes in which he had &s;uffered &s;o much before; but the parched de&s;arts, which &s;tretched them&s;elves from Guzerat to the Indus, were le&s;s unho&s;pitable to Dara than a brother's hands.</P>

He again applied to that chief  for his aid, but he was deaf to the reque&s;t. Dara promi&s;ed largely, &s;hould Fortune again favour his cau&s;e; but &s;he had taken her &s;light to return no more. J&acirc;m was too prudent to throw his own fate into the &s;cale of the prince. He became cold and re&s;erved; and &s;eemed, by his manner, to wi&s;h for the departure of his un|fortunate gue&s;t. He was again &s;orced to encounter the hard&s;hips of the de&s;art. The heat of the &s;ea&s;on had added to the natural &s;terility of the&s;e dreadful &s;olitudes. There was no water to be found; not a blade of gra&s;s to be &s;een. The air &s;eemed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on &s;ire. There was nothing to &s;hade the de&s;olate tra|vellers from the &s;corching &s;un; excepting when clouds of &s;and, rai&s;ed by whirlwinds, covered them with a &s;atal darkne&s;s. The

The favourite elephant, which had often carried Dara in all his pomp, was now the only u&s;eful ani|mal that remained; and even he began to fail. To add to the misfortunes of the prince, the favourite Sultana, the mother of all his children, and whom he tenderly loved, was at the point of death. She had been &s;eized with hy&s;teries from the fright of the battle; and had ever &s;ince been &s;ubject to violent fits.

Curio&s;ity, however, brought the whole village around; and every eye was full of tears. They brought all their bea&s;ts of burden to the place; and the whole country accompanied him, with &s;houts of joy, to Tatta. He, however, did not re&s;t long in that city. He cro&s;&s;ed the Indus, and threw him&s;elf under the protection of the petty chiefs of the di&s;trict of Bicker; and they, touched with compa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed to &s;upport him with their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>The active &s;pirit of the emperor was not, in the mean time, idle. So long as Dara lives, he mu&s;t totter on his throne. He knew the rout which his unfortunate brother had taken; but his troops would not pur&s;ue the fugitive through &s;uch a perilous way.

That judge, upon the cleare&s;t proofs, condemned him twice to death; and, at the reque&s;t of Dara, he was pardoned by the emperor, and re&s;tored to his e&s;tate which had been confi&s;cated.

No. It was an old animal, dirty and lean, with a tattered cover, a pitiful &s;eat, and the ca&s;tle open on all &s;ides to the winds. The &s;plendid ornaments of his per&s;on were now vani&s;hed, like his good fortune. A dirty dre&s;s of coar&s;e linen &s;carce covered his body from the weather; and his wretched turban was wrapt round with a &s;carf made of Ca&s;hmire wool.

The zeal of the people, however, proved fatal to Dara. The emperor, hearing of the tumult near the gate of Lahore, ordered the chief magi&s;trate of the city, with his officers, to go to the place, and enquire into the cau&s;e of the di&s;turbance.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE>THE fears of the emperor from the mo&s;t formidable of his rivals, were extingui&s;hed with the life of Dara. The &s;ilence which accompanies the deci&s;ions of de&s;poti&s;m, is an effectual pre|vention  of tumult and confu&s;ion. The people, for &s;ome days, were &s;trangers to the death of the prince, and his prior misfortunes had even le&s;&s;ened the regret, which his murder might have other|wi&s;e created in the minds of mankind. Mi&s;ery had ri&s;en to its height; and the wor&s;t period it could have, was in &s;ome degree fortunate. The conduct of the emperor contributed to obliterate his crimes. With an appearance of humanity and benevolence in the common operations of government, men were apt to attribute the in&s;tances of cruelty which he exhibited, to the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation; and they forgot the evils done to individuals, in the ge|neral good of the whole. Should &s;elf-pre&s;ervation be admitted
<PB N="317" REF="481">
as an excu&s;e for the commi&s;&s;ion of bad actions, Aurungz&ecirc;be was not without apology. He had gone too far not to go farther &s;till: he had depo&s;ed his father, he had excluded his brother from the throne, and a flame had been kindled which could be extingui&s;h|ed by nothing but blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations of Suja.</NOTE>During the misfortunes of Dara in the we&s;t and north, the war was carried on with vigour in Bengal again&s;t Suja. That prince  having, after the unfortunate battle of Kidgw&acirc;, e&s;caped to Mon|geer, was active in making new preparations for the field. Na|turally bold and intrepid, misfortune had no effect upon him but to redouble his diligence to retrieve it; and he wanted not re&s;our|ces in his province for recommencing ho&s;tilities, with an appear|ance of being able for &s;ome time to ward off the hand of Fate, which &s;eemed to hang over his head. His fir&s;t care was to collect the remains of his di&s;&s;ipated army in the neighbourhood of Mon|geer, which commands the pa&s;s into Bengal; and, whil&s;t he was collecting more troops from the exten&s;ive country in his rear, he drew lines from the mountains to the Ganges, to &s;top the progre&s;s of the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jumla turns his rear.</NOTE>Mahommed, the &s;on of Aurungz&ecirc;be, had been detached with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e from the field of Kidgw&acirc; in pur&s;uit of Suja.  The prince was &s;oon joined by Jumla the vi&s;ier, with a great force; and they proceeded &s;lowly down along the banks of the Ganges. The &s;trong po&s;ition of Suja gave him a manife&s;t advan|tage; and Jumla, an able and experienced officer, contrived to drive him from his po&s;t without blood&s;hed. The ridge of mountains to the right of the Ganges are, in their fertile valleys, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by petty, but independent princes. Jumla found means to draw the&s;e over to his party; and they &s;hewed to him a pa&s;&s;age through their country, by which he could turn the rear of Suja. Having, by
<PB N="318" REF="482">
way of blind, left a con&s;iderable part of the army to fall down, in the common rout, along the river, he him&s;elf, accompanied by the prince, entered the mountains, and was heard of by Suja in his rear, when he expected to be attacked in front. Suja de|camped with precipitation; but he arrived in the environs of Ra|ja-M&acirc;hil &s;ome days before Jumla i&s;&s;ued from the mountains. He fortified him&s;elf in his camp; and the vi&s;ier, who could make no impre&s;&s;ion without artillery, marched toward the left, to join the army coming down along the Ganges.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacks him in his lines.</NOTE>The whole army having joined, the Imperiali&s;ts pre&s;ented them|&s;elves  before the lines of Suja. The vi&s;ier opened upon him with his artillery, and made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;aults. During &s;ix days he was repul&s;ed with &s;laughter; but Suja dur&s;t not tru&s;t the effeminate natives of Bengal in the open field again&s;t the Tartars of the north, who compo&s;ed the greater part of the Imperial army. Jumla played ince&s;&s;antly with his artillery upon the fortifications, which being only made up of hurdles and loo&s;e &s;andy &s;oil, were &s;oon ruined. Suja's po&s;t becoming untenable, he decamped under the favour of night; and Jumla, afraid of an ambu&s;h, though he was appri&s;ed of the retreat of the enemy, dur&s;t not follow him. The rainy &s;ea&s;on commenced on the very night of Suja's flight; and the Imperiali&s;ts were con&s;trained to remain inactive for &s;ome months in the neighbourhood of Raja-M&acirc;hil.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suja retreats.</NOTE>Suja, with his army, cro&s;&s;ing the Ganges, took the rout of Tanda;  and, during the inactivity of the Imperiali&s;ts, &s;trengthened him&s;elf with troops from the Lower Bengal. He al&s;o drew from that quar|ter a great train of artillery, which was wrought by Portugue&s;e and other Europeans, who were &s;ettled in that country. Suja, being at|tached to no &s;y&s;tem of religion, was favourable to all. He promi&s;ed to build churches for the Chri&s;tians, &s;hould he &s;ucceed in his views
<PB N="319" REF="483">
on the empire; and the mi&s;&s;ionaries and fathers entered with zeal into his cau&s;e. The affairs of the prince began to wear a better a&s;pect. His effeminate troops acquired confidence from a well-&s;erved artillery; and even Aurungz&ecirc;be, who confided much in the abilities of Jumla, was not without anxiety. An event happened about this time which rai&s;ed the hopes of Suja, and added to the fears of his brother.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince Mahommed</NOTE>The prince Mahommed, who, in conjunction with Jumla,  commanded the Imperial army, had, before the civil war, con|ceived a pa&s;&s;ion for one of the daughters of Suja. Overtures of marriage had been made and accepted; but the con&s;ummation of the nuptials had been broken off by the troubles which di&s;turbed the times. He &s;eemed even to have forgot his betrothed wife in his activity in the field; but the prince&s;s, moved by the misfor|tunes of her father, wrote with her own hand a very moving letter to Mahommed. She lamented her unhappy fate, in &s;eeing the prince whom &s;he loved, armed again&s;t her father. She expre&s;&s;ed her pa&s;&s;ion and unfortunate condition, in terms which found their way to his heart. His former affections were rekindled in all their fury; and, in the elevation of his mind, he re&s;olved to de&s;ert his father's cau&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">goes over to Suja.</NOTE>The vi&s;ier, upon affairs of &s;ome importance, was, in the mean  time, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the army, which lay at Raja-M&acirc;hil. The opportunity was favourable for the late adopted &s;cheme of Mahom|med. He opened the affair to &s;ome of his friends: he complained of his father's coldne&s;s, and even of his ingratitude, to a &s;on, to whom, as having &s;eized the per&s;on of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, he owed the empire. He gave many in&s;tances of his own &s;ervices; many of the unju&s;t re|turns made by Aurungz&ecirc;be, and concluded by declaring his fixed re&s;olution to join Suja. They endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from &s;o ra&s;h an action; but he had taken his re&s;olution, and he would

li&s;ten to no argument. He a&s;ked them, Whether they would follow his fortunes? they replied, <Q REND="inline">"We are the &s;ervants of Ma|hommed; and if the prince will to-night join Suja, he is &s;o much beloved by the army, that the whole will go over to him by the dawn of day."</Q> On the&s;e vague a&s;&s;urances, the prince quitted the camp that evening with a &s;mall retinue. He embarked in a boat on the Ganges; and the troops thought that he had only gone on a party of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jumla per|plexed;</NOTE>Some of the pretended friends of Mahommed wrote letters, con|taining  an account of the de&s;ertion of the prince, to the vi&s;ier. That lord was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at the folly and madne&s;s of the deed. He thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that, without having &s;e|cured the army, he could de&s;ert his father's cau&s;e. He was per|plexed with anxiety and doubt; he expected every moment to hear, that the troops were in full march to Tanda; and he was afraid to join them, with a de&s;ign of re&s;toring them to their duty, le&s;t he &s;hould be carried pri&s;oner to the enemy. He, however, after &s;ome he&s;itation, re&s;olved to di&s;charge the part of a good officer. He &s;et out expre&s;s for the camp, where he arrived next day. He found things in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, but not in &s;uch a de&s;perate &s;ituation as he had expected. A great part of the army was mutinous, and begin|ning to plunder the tents of tho&s;e who continued in their duty. The&s;e had taken arms in defence of their property; &s;o that blood|&s;hed mu&s;t &s;oon have en&s;ued. The country, on every &s;ide of the camp, was covered with whole &s;quadrons that &s;led from the flame of di&s;&s;ention which had been kindled. Tumult, commotion, and di&s;order reigned everywhere when the vi&s;ier entered the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">quells</NOTE>The appearance of that lord, who was re&s;pected for his great  qualities by all, &s;oon &s;ilenced the &s;torm. He mounted an ele|phant in the center of the camp, and &s;poke after this manner to the army, who crowded tumultuou&s;ly round him: <Q>"You are
<PB N="321" REF="485">
no &s;trangers, my fellow-&s;oldiers, to the flight of the prince Ma|hommed, and to his having preferred the love of the daughter of Suja to his allegiance to his &s;overeign and father. Intoxicated by the &s;ame to which your valour had rai&s;ed him, he has long been pre&s;umptuous in his hopes. Ambition brought him to the edge of the precipice over which he has been thrown by love. But in abandoning you, he has abandoned his fortune; and, after the fir&s;t tran&s;ports are over, regret, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of folly, will only remain. Suja has perhaps pledged his faith to &s;upport the infatu|ated prince again&s;t his father; he may have even promi&s;ed the throne of India as a reward for his treachery. But how can Suja perform his promi&s;e? We have &s;een his ho&s;tile &s;tandards&mdash;but we have &s;een them only to be &s;eized. Bengal abounds with men, with provi&s;ions, with wealth; but valour is not the growth of that &s;oil. The armies of Aurungz&ecirc;be are numerous; like you they are drawn from the north, and he is him&s;elf as invincible in the field as he is wi&s;e and deci&s;ive in the cabinet.</Q></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">a mutiny</NOTE><Q>"But &s;hould we even &s;uppo&s;e that Fortune, which has hither|to  been &s;o favourable to Aurungz&ecirc;be, &s;hould de&s;ert him in another field, would Mahommed reign? Would Suja, experienced in the arts of government, and ambitious as he is of power, place the &s;cepter of India in the hands of a boy? Would he &s;ubmit to the authority of the &s;on of a younger brother? to the tool of his own de&s;igns? The impo&s;&s;ibility is glaring and obvious. Return, therefore, my fellow-&s;oldiers, to your duty. You can conquer without Mahommed. Fortune has not followed him to the ene|my. Your valour can command her every where. He has em|braced his own ruin; but why &s;hould we &s;hare in his adver&s;e fate? Bengal lies open before you: the enemy are ju&s;t not totally broken. They are not objects of terror, but of plunder: you may acquire wealth without trouble, and glory without toil."</Q></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">in the army.</NOTE>This &s;peech of the vi&s;ier had the intended effect. Every &s;pe|cies of di&s;order and tumult &s;ub&s;ided in a moment. The troops de|&s;ired to be led to the enemy; and Jumla did not permit their ar|dor  to cool. He immediately began to throw a bridge of boats acro&s;s the river. The work was fini&s;hed in three days; and he pa&s;&s;ed the Ganges with his whole army. Mahommed, in the mean time, having arrived at Tanda, was received with every mark of re&s;pect by Suja. The nuptials were celebrated with the utmo&s;t magnificence and pomp; and the fe&s;tivity was &s;carce over, when certain news arrived of the near approach of the Imperial army under Jumla. Suja immediately i&s;&s;ued out with all his forces from Tanda. He po&s;ted him&s;elf in an advantageous ground, and waited for the enemy, with a determined re&s;olution to ri&s;k all on the i&s;&s;ue of a battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeats Suja.</NOTE>Mahommed, who was naturally full of confidence and bold|ne&s;s, did not de&s;pair of bringing over the greate&s;t part of the ar|my  of Jumla to his own &s;ide. He erected his &s;tandard in the front of Suja's camp; and when that prince drew out his forces in order of battle, he placed him&s;elf in the center of the fir&s;t line. Jumla, con&s;cious of the &s;uperiority of his own troops in point of valour, was glad to find the enemy in the open field. He formed his line, and ordered a column of hor&s;e to fall immediately upon Mahom|med. That prince vainly &s;uppo&s;ed, when the enemy advanced, that they were determined to de&s;ert Jumla. But he was &s;oon con|vinced of his error by the warmth of their attack. He behaved with his u&s;ual bravery; but the effeminate natives of Bengal were not to be kept to their colours. They fled; and he was carried along with their flight. The utmo&s;t efforts of Suja proved al&s;o ineffectual. His troops gave way on all &s;ides; and he him&s;elf was the la&s;t who quitted the field. A great &s;laughter was made in the pur&s;uit, and Tanda opened her gates to the conqueror. The
<PB N="323" REF="487">
princes fled to Dacca in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, leaving the elde&s;t &s;on of Suja dead on the field: but Jumla, remaining for &s;ome time in Tanda to &s;ettle the affairs of the now almo&s;t conquered province, gave them &s;ome re&s;pite, which they employed in levying a new army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Artifice of Aurungz&ecirc;be</NOTE>The news of the flight of Mahommed arriving in the mean  time at Delhi, Aurungz&ecirc;be concluded that the whole army in Ben|gal had gone over to Suja. He immediately marched from the capital with a great force. He took, with incredible expedition, the rout of Bengal. He however had not advanced far from Delhi, when intelligence of the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in the battle of Tanda met him on his way, and he forthwith returned to the ca|pital. He there had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual policy. He wrote a letter to his &s;on, as if in an&s;wer to one received; and he con|trived matters &s;o, that it &s;hould be intercepted by Suja. That prince, having peru&s;ed the letter, placed it in the hands of Ma|hommed, who &s;wore by the Prophet that he had never once written to his father &s;ince the battle of Kidgw&acirc;. The letter was conceiv|ed in terms like the&s;e:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to &s;eparate Mahommed</NOTE><Q>"To our beloved &s;on Mahommed, who&s;e happine&s;s and &s;afety are joined with our life.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">from Suja.</NOTE>The letter made an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Suja, which all the prote&s;tations of Mahommed could not remove. He became  &s;ilent and di&s;contented.

Having continued three days in this agitation of mind, he at la&s;t &s;ent for the prince. He told him, in the pre&s;ence of his council, that af|ter all the &s;truggles of affection with &s;u&s;picion, the latter had pre|vailed; that he could no longer behold Mahommed with an eye of friend&s;hip, &s;hould he even &s;wear to his innocence in the holy tem|ple of Mecca; that the bond of union and confidence which had lately &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them was broken; and that, in&s;tead of a &s;on and a friend, he beheld him in the light of an enemy. <Q REND="inline">"It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for the peace of both," continued Suja, "that Mahommed &s;hould depart.

Jumla, the very next day, received a packet from court; which contained orders to &s;end Mahommed, &s;hould he fall into his hands, under a &s;trong e&s;cort to Delhi. The offi|cer who commanded the party was ordered to obey the commands of the prince; but he, at the &s;ame time, received in&s;tructions to watch his motions, and to prevent his e&s;cape.

A public pretence mu&s;t be made to gain the wealth of Suja, and to appea&s;e his enemies by his death. The report of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the Raja was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad. It was affirmed that Suja had formed a de&s;ign to mount the throne of Arrac&acirc;n, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating its monarch. The thing was in it&s;elf improbable.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections.</NOTE>THE war with Suja, which was carried on in the extremity of the empire, neither di&s;turbed the repo&s;e of Aurung|z&ecirc;be, nor diverted his attention from the civil affairs of the &s;tate. Impartial and deci&s;ive in his mea&s;ures, he was even acknowledged  to be a good prince, by tho&s;e who recognized not his right to the throne; and men began to wonder, how he, who was &s;o ju&s;t, could be &s;o cruel. The people &s;uffered little by the civil war. The damage done by the marching and counter-marching of armies, was paid out of the public trea&s;ury. An exact di&s;cipline had been ob&s;erved by all parties; for the rivals for the crown of Hindo&s;tan, though in the &s;ield again&s;t one another, could not per&s;uade them&s;elves that they were in an enemy's country. The prince who prevailed in a province, extended not the puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="334" REF="498">
of trea&s;on to tho&s;e who &s;upported a competitor with their &s;words; and, what is &s;carce credible, not one man beyond the family of Timur, was either a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in private, or &s;lain by the hands of public ju&s;tice, during a civil war, &s;o long, &s;o bloody, and &s;o various in its events.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prudent ad|mini&s;tration</NOTE>The emperor accu&s;tomed to bu&s;ine&s;s, in his long government of  various provinces, was well acquainted with the whole detail of public affairs. Nothing was &s;o minute as to e&s;cape his no|tice. He knew that the power and con&s;equence of the prince depended upon the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the people; and he was even from &s;elfi&s;h views an enemy to oppre&s;&s;ion, and an encourager of agriculture and commercial indu&s;try. He e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a perfect &s;ecurity of property over all his dominions. The forms of ju&s;tice were made le&s;s intricate, and more expeditious than under former reigns. To corrupt a judge was rendered for the fir&s;t time a crime. The fees paid in the courts of judicature were a&s;certained with accuracy and preci&s;ion; and a delay in the execution of ju&s;tice, &s;ubjected the judge to the payment of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the party aggrieved.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of Aurung|zebe.</NOTE>The cour&s;e of appeals from inferior to &s;uperior courts was unin|terrupted and free; but to prevent a wanton exertion of this pri|vilege,  the appellant was &s;everely fined, when his complaint again&s;t a judgment was found frivolous and ill-founded. The di&s;tributers of public ju&s;tice, when their decrees were rever&s;ed, could not always &s;creen them&s;elves under a pretended error in judgment. Should the matter appear clear, they were turned out of their offices, as &s;wayed by partiality or bribery. Aurung|z&ecirc;be, &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, e&s;tabli&s;hed a prece|dent of this kind. An appeal came before him in the pre&s;ence of the nobles. The deci&s;ion had been unju&s;t. He &s;ent for the judge, and told him in public, <Q REND="inline">"This matter is clear and ob|vious;
<PB N="335" REF="499">
if you have no abilities to perceive it in that light, you are unfit for your place, as a weak man; if you &s;uffered your&s;elf to be overcome by pre&s;ents, you are an unju&s;t man, and there|fore unworthy of your office."</Q> Having thus reprimanded the judge; he dive&s;ted him of his employment, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with ignominy from his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations on his con|duct.</NOTE>But this is the fair &s;ide of the character of Aurungz&ecirc;be. Dark  and determined in his policy, he broke through every re&s;traint to accompli&s;h his de&s;igns. He pointed in a direct line to the goal of ambition; and he cared not by what means he removed whatever object ob&s;tructed his way. He either believed that morality was incon&s;i&s;tent with the great tract of government; or, he acted as if he believed it; and he &s;ometimes de&s;cended into a vicious meanne&s;s, which threw di&s;credit on his abilities, as well as upon his hone&s;ty. He held the cloke of religion between his actions and the vulgar; and impiou&s;ly thanked the Divinity for a &s;ucce&s;s which he owed to his own wickedne&s;s. When he was mur|dering and per&s;ecuting his brothers and their families, he was building a magnificent mo&s;que at Delhi, as an offering to God for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him in the civil wars. He acted as high|prie&s;t at the con&s;ecration of this temple; and made a practice of attending divine &s;ervice there, in the humble dre&s;s of a Fakier. But when he lifted one hand to the Divinity, he, with the other, &s;igned warrants for the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of his relations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Artful con|duct of his &s;econd &s;on.</NOTE>During the civil wars which convul&s;ed the empire, all remained  quiet in the Decan. The prudent management of Mahommed Mauzim, the &s;econd &s;on of Aurungz&ecirc;be, prevented the lately conquered provinces from &s;haking off the yoke. That prince, with a great &s;hare of his father's abilities, exceeded him if po&s;|&s;ible in coolne&s;s and &s;elf-denial. He knew the &s;tern jealou&s;y of

the emperor; and he rather affected the humility of a &s;lave, than the manly confidence of a &s;on. He was no &s;tranger to the faci|lity with which his father could &s;acrifice every thing to his own &s;ecurity; and he looked upon him as an enemy who watched his motions, more than in the light of a parent who would grant indulgences for errors.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Aurung|z&ecirc;be.</NOTE>The anxiety &s;hewn by the emperor on the occa&s;ion, convinced mankind that he thought his own recovery doubtful. The lords quitted the palace, and each began to prepare again&s;t the wor&s;t events.  He &s;ent, on the fifth day, a &s;ummons to all the nobility to come to the hall of audience.

He ordered it to be &s;ealed up in a &s;ilken bag, with his private &s;ignet, and to be placed by his &s;ide. His exertion to &s;peak to the nobles threw him into a &s;woon. They thought him dead. A murmur flew around. He, however, recovered him&s;elf; and ordering Joy Singh and &s;ome of the principal lords to approach, he took them by the hand. Day after day he was thus brought into the pre&s;ence of the nobility. All intrigues cea&s;ed at the hopes of his recovery. On the tenth day of his illne&s;s, the fever began to leave him, and, on the thirteenth, though weak, he was apparently out of danger. The &s;torm that was gathering, &s;ub&s;ided at once. A &s;erene calm &s;ucceeded; and people wondered why their minds had been agitated and di&s;compo&s;ed, by the hopes and fears of revolution and change.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He recovers.</NOTE>The &s;ickne&s;s of Aurungz&ecirc;be was productive of a di&s;covery of importance, to a monarch of his jcalous and provident di&s;po&s;ition.  He &s;ound that Shaw Allum, whom he had de&s;igned for his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or in the throne, had &s;hewn more eagerne&s;s in forwarding the &s;chemes of his own ambition, than anxiety for the recovery of his father. He al&s;o found, from the reception given to the &s;olici|tations of the prince by the nobility, that his influence was too incon&s;iderable to &s;ecure to him the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the

empire. His pride was hurt by the fir&s;t; his prudence penetrated into the cau&s;e of the &s;econd. He had long thought the &s;elf-denial of his &s;on to be a cloke for &s;ome deep-laid de&s;ign; and an acci|dent had convinced him of the truth of what he had &s;u&s;pected before. The mother of Shaw Allum was only the daughter of a petty Raja. Aurungz&ecirc;be had, on account of her beauty, taken her to wife; but the meanne&s;s of her birth had left a kind of di&s;grace on her &s;on in the eyes of the nobles, who revered the high blood of the hou&s;e of Timur. The emperor, therefore, in his younge&s;t &s;on, found a remedy again&s;t the objections of the nobility to Shaw Allum. That prince was born to Aurungz&ecirc;be by the daughter of Shaw Naw&acirc;z, of the Imperial hou&s;e of Sefi. The Per&s;ian nobility, who were numerous in the &s;ervice of the empire, di&s;covered a great attachment to Akb&acirc;r; and even the Moguls preferred him on account of the purity of his blood, to his brother. The affections of the emperor were al&s;o in his favour; and he now &s;eriou&s;ly endeavoured to pave his way to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His demands</NOTE>When the family of Dara had, with the unfortunate prince, fallen  into the hands of Aurungz&ecirc;be, that monarch had, at the reque&s;t of his father and the prince&s;s Jehan&acirc;ra, delivered over the only daughter of Dara into their hands. She remained in the pri&s;on at Agra with her grandfather. Aurungz&ecirc;be, upon his recovery, wrote a letter, full of profe&s;&s;ions of regard, to his father; and he con|cluded it with a formal demand of the daughter of Dara, for his &s;on Akb&acirc;r; hoping, by that connection, to &s;ecure the influence of the young prince among the nobles. The &s;ierce &s;pirit of Shaw Jeh&acirc;n took fire; Jehan&acirc;ra's indignation aro&s;e. They rejected the propo&s;ition with di&s;dain; and the old emperor returned for an&s;wer, That the in&s;olence of Aurungz&ecirc;be was equal to his crimes.

She con|cealed a dagger in her bo&s;om; and declared, that &s;he would &s;uffer death a hundred times over, before &s;he would give her hand to the &s;on of her father's murderer. Shaw Jeh&acirc;n did not fail to acquaint Aurungz&ecirc;be of her re&s;olution, in her own words; and that prince, with his u&s;ual prudence, de&s;i&s;ted from his de&s;ign. He even took no notice of the har&s;hne&s;s of his father's letter. He wrote to him, &s;oon after, for &s;ome of the Imperial jewels, to adorn his throne. <Q REND="inline">"Let him govern with more ju&s;tice," &s;aid Shaw Jeh&acirc;n; "for equity and clemency are the only jewels that can adorn a throne.

The forwardne&s;s of the prince in making a party during his father's illne&s;s, adhered to the mind of Aurungz&ecirc;be; but he concealed his &s;entiments on that &s;ubject.

</ARGUMENT>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recovery of the emperor.</NOTE>THOUGH Aurungz&ecirc;be was judged out of danger on the thirteenth day of his illne&s;s, his di&s;order hung upon him for more than two months. His application to bu&s;ine&s;s was an  enemy to the &s;peedy re&s;toration of his health; but the annual rains, which commenced in July, having rendered the air more cool, his fever entirely left him, and he &s;oon regained his former &s;trength. His phy&s;icians advi&s;ed him to avoid, by an expedition to Ca&s;h|mire, the heat of the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on; and his favourite &s;i&s;ter Ro|chin&acirc;ra, who&s;e coun&s;el he generally followed, being very de&s;irous of vi&s;iting that delightful country, per&s;uaded him to prepare for his progre&s;s. The affairs of the empire had become &s;ettled with his re|turning health. The hopes of novelty had &s;ub&s;ided in the minds of the people; and the preci&s;ion with which government was car|ried on, left room for neither their hopes nor their fears. The &s;u|perficial
<PB N="354" REF="518">
judges of things however blamed the emperor for quit|ting the center of his dominions; whil&s;t his father remained a pri|&s;oner in his own capital. Aurungz&ecirc;be judged of the future by the pa&s;t; the nobles were tired of revolution and war, and the vul|gar are feldom mutinous or trouble&s;ome, where no glaring op|pre&s;&s;ion exi&s;ts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His progre&s;s</NOTE>About the middle of December 1644, the emperor, after a te|dious preparation for this progre&s;s, left Delhi; and moved toward  Lahore, at which city he arrived by &s;low marches at the end of &s;even weeks. The army which accompanied him in this tour, con&s;i&s;ted of near fifty thou&s;and men, exclu&s;ive of the retinues of his nobles, and the nece&s;&s;ary followers of the camp. The heavy baggage and artillery kept the common highway, but the em|peror him&s;elf deviated often into the country, to enjoy the diver|&s;ion of hunting. The prince&s;s Rochin&acirc;ra, fond of pomp and mag|nificence, was indulged in her favourite pa&s;&s;ion by the &s;plendor of her cavalcade. The emperor, who in a great mea&s;ure owed his &s;ucce&s;s to the intelligence which &s;he had from time to time tran&s;|mitted to him from the haram, &s;hewed him&s;elf grateful. Her jealou&s;y of the influence of Jehan&acirc;ra over her father fir&s;t attached her to the intere&s;ts of Aurungz&ecirc;be; and the partiality &s;hewn by her &s;i&s;ter to Dara, naturally threw Rochin&acirc;ra into the &s;cale of his foe. Her abilities rendered her &s;it for politics and intrigue; and the warmth of her con&s;titution, which &s;he could not con&s;ecrate to plea&s;ure, adapted her for bu&s;ine&s;s and action.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to Ca&s;hmire.</NOTE>The progre&s;s of the prince did not ob&s;truct the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate. Attended by all his officers, the deci&s;ions of each de|partment  were carried from the camp to every corner of the em|pire. Expre&s;&s;es &s;tood ready on hor&s;eback at every &s;tage; and the Imperial mandates were di&s;patched to the various provinces as &s;oon

as they were &s;ealed in the tent of audience. The nobles, as was cu&s;tomary in the capital, attended daily the pre&s;ence; and appeals were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed every morning as regularly as when the emperor re|mained at Delhi. The petitioners followed the court; and a &s;mall allowance from the public trea&s;ury was a&s;&s;igned to them, as a com|pen&s;ation for their additional expence in attending the Imperial camp. In this manner Aurungz&ecirc;be arrived at Ca&s;hmire. The beauty, the cool and &s;alubrious air of that country, induced him to relax his mind for a &s;hort time from bu&s;ine&s;s. He wandered over that charming valley, after a variety of plea&s;ures; and he &s;oon re|covered that vigour of con&s;titution which his attention to public bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as his late &s;ickne&s;s, had greatly impaired.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;turbances</NOTE>The univer&s;al peace which had encouraged the emperor to un|dertake  his progre&s;s to Ca&s;hmire, was not of long continuance. Di&s;turbances broke out in the kingdom of Guzerat. The Rajas of the mountains, thinking the tribute which they paid to the em|pire too high, rebelled. Rai Singh was cho&s;en chief of the confe|deracy. They joined their forces, and, i&s;&s;uing from their narrow valleys, pre&s;ented a con&s;iderable army in the open country. Cut|tub, a general of experience, was ordered again&s;t them with the troops &s;tationed in the adjacent provinces. He arrived before the rebels, and encamped in their pre&s;ence. Both armies entrenched them&s;elves, and watched the motions of each other. The com|manders were determined not to fight at a di&s;advantage; and they continued to hara&s;s one another with flying parties, whil&s;t the main bodies remained in their re&s;pective camps. Slight &s;kirmi&s;hes happened every day, in which neither &s;ide arrogated to them|&s;elves any great advantage.</P>

with the increa&s;ing moon, were un&s;uitable for a &s;urprize; but an accident happened which favoured their de&s;igns. Under the cover of a flying &s;hower, they fell upon the Moguls. Advancing in a cloud, they came unperceived to the intrenchments; and ma|ny had clambered over the walls before the &s;entries gave the alarm. A &s;udden tumult and confu&s;ion flew over the camp; and a dreadful &s;laughter commenced. The Moguls had no time either to arm or to form. The hor&s;es broke loo&s;e from their piquets, and ru&s;hed, in di&s;order, over men, and tents, and baggage, and arms. Some who had mounted were thrown headlong with their hor&s;es over the tent-ropes, and other embarra&s;&s;ments of the camp.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">quelled.</NOTE>A few in the mean time oppo&s;ed the enemy in a tumultuous manner. The Rajaputs them&s;elves were in di&s;order. The confu|&s;ion  and terror of the &s;cene intimidated all. They withdrew on both &s;ides; as they could not di&s;tingui&s;h friends from foes. The night was full of horror. Every heart beat with fear; every tongue joined in the uproar; every eye looked impatiently for day. The light of morning at length appeared; and a &s;udden &s;hout from both armies gave te&s;timony of their joy. Preferring certain danger to evils which they could not di&s;tingui&s;h clearly, each &s;ide, on the approach of battle, di&s;covered that elevation of &s;pirit which others derive from victory. The rebels renewed the attack, but the Imperial general, who had improved the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of battle, was now prepared to receive them. Rai Singh, with a body of his of|ficers, charged in the front of the Rajaputs, and &s;u&s;tained the whole &s;hock of the Moguls. Three hundred per&s;ons of rank, with Rai Singh, the general of the confederates, lay dead on the field; fifteen hundred of their followers were &s;lain, the remaining part of the rebels having fled, and left their camp &s;tanding to the victors. The Imperial general pur&s;ued the fugitives into their moun|tains; and, in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, he reduced their whole coun|try,

Aurungz&ecirc;be, jealous of the great power and reputation of Jumla, had &s;ignified to that lord, that his pre&s;ence in the capital would be &s;oon nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;charging the duties of his high office of vi|&s;ier. He at the &s;ame time informed him, that he longed much to have an opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing in per&s;on the high &s;en&s;e which he entertained of his eminent &s;ervices. Jumla, who preferred the pomp and activity of the field to the &s;edentary bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the clo&s;et, &s;ignified to the emperor his de&s;ire of continuing in his province; pointing out a &s;ervice, from which the empire might derive great advantage, and he him&s;elf con&s;iderable honour.</P>

An army inured to war were devoted to Jumla; and his ambition was not greater than his ability to gratify it in the highe&s;t line. To the north of Bengal lies the rich province of A&s;|&s;&acirc;m, which di&s;charges the great river Baramputre into the branch of the Ganges which pa&s;&s;es by Dacca. The king of A&s;&s;&acirc;m, fall|ing down this river in his fleet of boats, had, during the civil wars, not only ravaged the lower Bengal, but appropriated to him&s;elf what part of that country lies between the Ganges at Dacca and the mountains which environ A&s;&s;&acirc;m. His power and wealth made

No enemy appeared in the field. They had withdrawn to the fortre&s;s of Azo, which the king had built on the &s;ide of the mountains which looks toward Bengal. Jumla in|ve&s;ted the place, and forced the garri&s;on to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion; then, entering the mountains of A&s;&s;am, defeated the king in a pitched battle, and be&s;ieged him in his capital of Kirganu. The vanqui&s;hed prince was &s;oon obliged to leave the city, with all its wealth, to the mercy of the enemy, and to take refuge, with a few adherents, in the mountains of La&s;&s;a. In many naval conflicts on the river and great lakes, through which it flowed, Jumla came off victorious; and the &s;mall forts on the banks fell &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into his hands.</P>

But the rainy &s;ea&s;on came on with unu&s;ual violence, and covered the valley which  forms the province of A&s;&s;&acirc;m, with water. There was no room left for retreating; none for advancing beyond Kirganu. The mountains around were involved in tempe&s;t, and, be&s;ides, were full of foes. The king, upon the approach of the Imperiali&s;ts, remov|ed the grain to the hills; and the cattle were driven away. Di&s;|tre&s;s, in every form, attacked the army of Jumla. They had wealth, but they were de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, and of every thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting them in the country till the return of the fair &s;ea&s;on.

But the death of that general put an end to this wild de&s;ign. Upon his arrival at Azo, a dreadful &s;ickne&s;s prevailed in the army, and he him&s;elf fell a victim to the epidemic malady which carried off his troops.

equal in abilities to Aurungz&ecirc;be, with no part of the duplicity which &s;tampt &s;ome of the actions of that prince with meanne&s;s. Jumla, to his death, retained the name of Vi&s;ier, though the duties of the office were di&s;charged by Raja Ragnatta, who did not long &s;urvive him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection</NOTE>The &s;ecurity which Aurungz&ecirc;be acquired by the defeat of &s;o many formidable rivals, was di&s;turbed from a quarter which add|ed  ridicule to danger. In the territory of the prince of Marw&acirc;r, near the city of Nagur, there lived an old woman, who was arriv|ed at the eightieth year of her age. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable hereditary e&s;tate, and had accumulated, by penury, a great &s;um of money. Being &s;eized with a fit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;he became all of a &s;udden prodigal of her wealth. Fakiers and &s;turdy beggars, under a pretence of religion, to the number of five thou&s;and, gathered round her ca&s;tle, and received her bounty. The&s;e vagabonds, not &s;atisfied with what the old woman be&s;towed in charity, armed them|&s;elves, and, making predatory excur&s;ions into the country, returned with &s;poil to the hou&s;e of their patrone&s;s, where they mixed intem|perance and riot with devotion. The people, oppre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e &s;anctified robbers, ro&s;e upon them, but they were defeated with great &s;laughter.</P>
<P>Repeated di&s;a&s;ters of the &s;ame kind were at la&s;t attributed to the power of enchantment. This ridiculous opinion gaining ground, fear became predominant in the opponents of the Fakiers. The banditti, acquiring confidence from their &s;ucce&s;s, burnt and de&s;troy|ed the country for many leagues; and &s;urrounded the ca&s;tle of the pretended enchantre&s;s with a de&s;art. The Raja marched again&s;t them with his native troops, but was defeated; the collectors of the Imperial revenue attacked them, but they were forced to give way. A report prevailed, and was cagerly believed by the multi|tude, that on a certain day of the moon, the old lady u&s;ed to cook
<PB N="361" REF="525">
in the &s;kull of an enemy, a me&s;s compo&s;ed of owls, bats, &s;nakes, lizards, human fle&s;h, and other horrid ingredients, which &s;he di&s;|tributed to her followers. This abominable meal, it was believed by the rabble, had the &s;urpri&s;ing effect of not only rendering them void of all fear them&s;elves, and of in&s;piring their enemies with ter|ror, but even of making them invi&s;ible in the hour of battle, when they dealt their deadly blows around.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fakiers</NOTE>Their numbers being now encrea&s;ed to twenty thou&s;and, this motley army, with an old woman at their head, directed their  march toward the capital. Bi&s;tamia, for that was her name, was a commander full of cruelty. She covered her rout with murder and deva&s;tation, and hid her rear in the &s;moke of burning villages and towns. Having advanced to Narnoul, about five days journey from Agra, the collector of the revenue in that place oppo&s;ed her with a force, and was totally defeated. The affair was now be|come &s;erious, and commanded the attention of the emperor. He found that the minds of the &s;oldiers were tainted with the preju|dices of the people, and he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to combat Bi&s;tamia with weapons like her own. Sujait was ordered again&s;t the re|bels. The emperor, in the pre&s;ence of the army, delivered to that general, billets written with his own hand, which were &s;aid to con|tain magical incantations. His reputation for &s;anctity was at lea&s;t equal to that of Bi&s;tamia; and he ordered a billet to be carried on the point of a &s;pear before each &s;quadron, which the &s;oldiers were made to believe would counteract the enchantments of the enemy. The credulity which induced them to dread the witchcraft of the old woman, gave them confidence in the pretended charm of Au|rungz&ecirc;be.</P>

In the mid&s;t of their intemperate joy, Sujait made his appearance. They fought with the fury of fanatics; but when the idea of &s;u|pernatural aid was di&s;pelled from the minds of the Imperiali&s;ts, the Fakiers were not a match for their &s;words. It was not a battle, but a confu&s;ed carnage: a few owed their lives to the mercy of Sujait, the re&s;t met the death which they de&s;erved. Au|rungz&ecirc;be, when he received Sujait, after his victory, could not help &s;miling at the ridicule thrown upon his arms, by the oppo|&s;ition of an old woman at the head of a naked army of mendi|cants. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;ind," &s;aid he, "that too much religion among the vulgar, is as dangerous as too little in a monarch."</Q> The emperor, upon this occa&s;ion, acted the part of a great prince, who turns the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;uper&s;titions of mankind, to the accompli&s;hment of his own de&s;igns.

Impatient  under his confinement, his health had been long upon the de|cline; and grief put at la&s;t an end to misfortune which the pa&s;&s;ions of youth had begun. His favourite wife, the daughter of Suja, was the companion of his melancholy; and &s;he pined away with &s;orrow, as being the cau&s;e of the unhappy fate of her lord. Mahommed had long &s;upported his &s;pirits with the hopes that his father would relent; but the &s;ickne&s;s of the emperor, dur|ing which he had named another prince to the throne, confirmed him that his crime was not to be forgiven. Mahommed, though violent in the nobler pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind, was in his pri|vate character generous, friendly and humane. He loved battle for its dangers; he de&s;pi&s;ed glory which was not purcha&s;ed with peril. He was even di&s;appointed when an enemy fled; and was heard to &s;ay, That to pur&s;ue fugitives was only the bu&s;ine&s;s of a coward.

Jehangire who, with his want of credulity on the &s;ubject of religion, was weak in his under&s;tanding, was always &s;wayed by the la&s;t who &s;poke.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The origin</NOTE>THE emperor having, by his addre&s;s, as well as by his crimes, extricated him&s;elf from dome&s;tic ho&s;tilities, was &s;uddenly involved in a foreign war. The Per&s;ians, who with a  prepo&s;terous negligence, had remained quiet during the civil di&s;&s;entions in India, &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to attack Aurungz&ecirc;be, after his fortune and conduct had firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed him on the throne. But various rea&s;ons had induced Shaw Ab&acirc;s the Second, who, with no mean abilities, held then the &s;eepter of Per&s;ia, to avoid coming to extremities with the hou&s;e of Timur, when all its branches were in arms. The un&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions again&s;t the unconquered tribes along the Indian ocean, had drained his trea&s;ury; and Moh&acirc;bet, who remained in a &s;tate of neutrality in the
<PB N="375" REF="539">
northern provinces of Hindo&s;tan, kept an army of veterans in the field. The other pa&s;&s;ions of Ab&acirc;s were more violent than his ambition. He &s;eemed more anxious to pre&s;erve his dignity at home, than to purcha&s;e fame by his arms aborad; and, had not his pride been wounded by an accident, more than from any de&s;ign, on the &s;ide of Aurungz&ecirc;be, that monarch might have enjoyed in tranquillity an empire which he had acquired by blood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the</NOTE>The death of Dara and the flight of Suja having given &s;tability to  the power of Aurungz&ecirc;be in the eyes of the princes of the north, he had received, in the fourth year of his reign, congratulatory emba&s;&s;ies from Tartary and Per&s;ia. To return the compliment to Shaw Ab&acirc;s, Tirbiet Chan, a man of high dignity, was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador from the court of Delhi to I&s;pahan. He was received with the ceremony and re&s;pect which was due to the repre&s;entative of &s;o great a prince as the emperor of Hindo&s;tan. His credentials were read, in the hall of audience, in the pre&s;ence of the nobility; and the few pre&s;ens, which the &s;uddenne&s;s of his departure from his court had permitted him to bring along with him to Ab&acirc;s, were accepted with conde&s;cen&s;ion and expre&s;&s;ions of &s;atisfaction. Tirbiet wrote an account of his reception to Delhi; and the em|peror ordered magnificent pre&s;ents to be prepared, and &s;ent, under an e&s;cort, to Per&s;ia.</P>

Some pre&s;ents had been, at the &s;ame time, ordered to be prepared for the prince of the U&s;becs, whom it was cu&s;tomary to addre&s;s only by the title of Wali, or Ma&s;ter of the We&s;tern Tartary. The &s;ame clerk in the office made out

the inventory of the pre&s;ents for both the princes; and, at the head of the li&s;t for Per&s;ia, he called Shaw Ab&acirc;s, Wali, or Ma&s;ter of Iran. The inventory, accompanied by a letter to the emperor, was &s;ent with the pre&s;ents to Tirbiet; and he, without examining either, demanded an audience of Ab&acirc;s, and placed both in his hands as he &s;at upon his throne. Ab&acirc;s, though otherwi&s;e an excellent prince, was much addicted to wine. He was intoxi|cated when he received Tirbiet; and with an impatience to know the particulars of the pre&s;ents, he threw fir&s;t his eyes on the in|ventory. When he read the Wali, or Ma&s;ter of Per&s;ia, he &s;tarted, in a rage, from his throne, and drew his dagger from his &s;ide. The nobles &s;hrunk back on either &s;ide, and Tirbiet, who &s;tood on the &s;teps which led up to the Imperial canopy, retreated from the wrath of Ab&acirc;s.

The emperor of Per&s;ia, in the mean time, ordered every nece&s;&s;ary preparation for war. The troops &s;tationed on the &s;kirts  of the empire were commanded to a&s;&s;emble; new levies were made; and a general ardour for an inva&s;ion of India, ran through all the Per&s;ian dominions. Aurungz&ecirc;be, upon receiving the letters of Tirbiet, wrote an immediate an&s;wer to that lord. He laid the the whole blame on the inadvertence and ignorance of a clerk in office; declaring, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he never meant an affront to the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Sefi. <Q REND="inline">"The title of Allum|gire," &s;aid he, "is adopted from an ancient cu&s;tom, preva|lent among the po&s;terity of Timur.

The emperor delivered them over for examina|tion to Alim&acirc;d, one of his principal nobles. Alim&acirc;d, having carried the Tartars to his own hou&s;e, began to a&s;k them que&s;tions concerning their commi&s;&s;ion from the king of Per&s;ia. They re|mained &s;ilent, and he threatened them with the torture. One of them immediately &s;natched a &s;word from the &s;ide of one of Alim&acirc;d's attendants; and, with one blow, laid that lord dead at his feet. Three more, who were in the room, were &s;lain. The Tartars arming them&s;elves with the weapons of the dead, i&s;&s;ued forth, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in the crowd, and, notwith&s;tanding all the vigilance, activity, and promi&s;es of Aurungz&ecirc;be, they were never heard of more. The emperor, naturally &s;u&s;picious, began to &s;up|po&s;e that the Per&s;ian nobles in his &s;ervice had &s;ecreted the &s;pies.

It appeared from the letter, that a con&s;piracy was formed by all the Per&s;ian nobility in the &s;ervice of India, to betray Aurungz&ecirc;be into the hands of the enemy, &s;hould he take the field. The emperor was thrown into the utmo&s;t perplexity. His rage, for once, got the better of his prudence.

a proclamation, that none of them &s;hould &s;tir abroad upon pain of death.

He commanded that the hor&s;es, as a dreadful denunciation of his wrath, &s;hould be killed before the gates of the con&s;pirators.

He endeavoured, by promi&s;es and fair pretences, to get the principals into his hands. But they had taken the alarm, and no one would tru&s;t him&s;elf to the clemency of an enraged de&s;pot. Upon the fir&s;t intelligence of the con&s;piracy, the emperor wrote to his &s;i&s;ter Je|han&acirc;ra, who re&s;ided at Agra, to come with all expedition to Delhi. The Per&s;ian nobles, he knew, had been attached to Shaw Jeh&acirc;n, to who&s;e favour they had owed their promotion in the empire; and he hoped that they would li&s;ten to the advice of the favourite daughter of the prince whom they loved.

That the Patan nobility, warlike, numerous, di&s;affected, &s;till hankering after their ancient domination of which they had been deprived by the folly of their princes, as much as by the valour of the Moguls, would not fail to throw their weight into the &s;cale of the Per&s;ians; and, upon the whole, they were of opinion, that peaceable mea&s;ures &s;hould be adopted toward dome&s;tic traitors, at lea&s;t till the danger of foreign war &s;hould be removed.</P>

The prince&s;s Jehan&acirc;ra arrived, in the mean time, from Agra. She had travelled from that city to Delhi, on an elephant, in le&s;s than two days, though the di&s;tance is two hun|dred miles.

He con|&s;idered that nature &s;eemed to have de&s;igned the two countries for &s;eparate empires, from the immen&s;e ridge of mountains which divide them from one another, by an almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able line.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death and character of Shaw Ab&acirc;s.</NOTE>Shaw Ab&acirc;s was a prince of abilities, and when rouzed, fond of expedition and delighting in war. He was ju&s;t in his deci&s;ions, mild in his temper, and affable in his conver&s;ation. De&s;titute of prejudices  of every kind, he made no di&s;tinction of countries, none of &s;y&s;tems of religion. He encouraged men of worth of every nation; they had acce&s;s to his per&s;on, he heard and redre&s;&s;ed their grievances, and rewarded their merit. He was, however, jealous of his pre|rogative, and he was determined to be obeyed. He could forgive the guilty, upon being convinced of their contrition; but an in&s;ult on his dignity he would never forgive. His pa&s;&s;ions were na|turally &s;trong; he broke often forth like a fla&s;h of lightning; but when he was mo&s;t agitated, a calm was near; and he &s;eemed to be a&s;hamed of the trifles which ruffled his temper. He loved ju&s;tice for its own &s;ake; and through his exce&s;&s;es in wine gave birth &s;ometimes to folly, they never gave ri&s;e to an act of inju&s;tice. He was fond of the company of women; and his love of variety produced the di&s;temper of which he died.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Per&s;ia.</NOTE>Upon the death of Shaw Ab&acirc;s, his uncle remained in the com|mand of the Per&s;ian army. He &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to Aurungz&ecirc;be,  acquinting him of the death of his nephew; and that he left him to chu&s;e either peace or war. The emperor returned &s;or an&s;wer,

That his own empire was ample; and that all he wanted was to defend it from in&s;ult and inva&s;ion. That the di&s;re&s;pectful words of Ab&acirc;s vani&s;hed with his life; for, con&s;cious of his own inte|grity and power, that he neither feared the abu&s;e, nor dreaded the arms of any prince. He condoled with the family of Sheick Sefi, for the lo&s;s of a monarch, who&s;e mo&s;t exceptionable action was his unprovoked attempt upon India. Aurungz&ecirc;be, however, left a powerful army on his frontiers. The Per&s;ians might be induced to derive advantage from the immen&s;e preparations which they had made; and he re&s;olved to tru&s;t nothing to their mode|ration. The prince Shaw Allum was, in the mean time, recalled to Delhi. The emperor, full of circum&s;pection and caution in all his actions, was re&s;olved to remove temptation from his &s;on. He feared that an army unemployed in a foreign war, might be con|verted into an in&s;trument of ambition at home. Shaw Allum copied his father's moderation and &s;elf-denial upon every occa&s;ion, and he, therefore, was not to be tru&s;ted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War in Bija|pour.</NOTE>During the alarm of the Per&s;ian war, the tributary &s;overeign of  Bijapour began to &s;hew a di&s;re&s;pect for the Imperial mandates; and though he did not ab&s;olutely rebel, his obedience was full of coldne&s;s and delay. Dil&ecirc;re Chan, by orders from the court of Delhi, led an army again&s;t the refractory tributary. He laid wa&s;te the country, and be&s;ieged the prince in his capital. Adil Shaw was &s;oon reduced to extremities for want of provi&s;ions; and he was upon the point of &s;urrendering him&s;elf at di&s;eretion, when orders arrived from the emperor, in the camp of Dil&ecirc;re, to break up the &s;iege, and to return immediately with the army to Delhi. The&s;e un&s;ea&s;onable orders proceeded from the jealou&s;y of Shaw Allum. He knew that Dil&ecirc;re was in the intere&s;t of his younger brother; and he was afraid that a conque&s;t of &s;uch &s;plendor would give him too much weight in the empire. He had in&s;inuated,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns of the prince Shaw Allum</NOTE>Shaw Allum, who had returned to the Decan, re&s;ided in the city of Aurungab&acirc;d. To di&s;appoint Dil&ecirc;re in his pro&s;pect of  fame, was not the only view of the prince. He meditated a revolt, and he was afraid of Dil&ecirc;re. His father's orders were fa|vourable to his wi&s;hes. He had received in&s;tructions from court to &s;eize the per&s;on of the &s;u&s;pected lord, &s;hould he &s;hew any marks of di&s;affection; or to &s;ubdue him by force of arms, &s;hould he appear refractory. Thus far the de&s;igns of Shaw Allum &s;ucceeded. Dil&ecirc;re, apprized of the prince's &s;chemes, broke up the &s;iege, though with regret, as the place was on the point of &s;urrendering.

The prince called a council of his principal officers, who had already &s;worn on the Coran to &s;upport him with their lives and fortunes. The Maraja, who was never happy but when he was hatching mi&s;chief again&s;t Aurungz&ecirc;be, was pre&s;ent. This prince propo&s;ed, that when Dil&ecirc;re came into the pre&s;ence, they &s;hould lay open to him their whole de&s;ign again&s;t the emperor; that in ca&s;e of his ap|pearing refractory, he &s;hould in&s;tantly be di&s;patched as a dan|gerous enemy. Though Shaw Allum did not altogether approve of the Maraja's violence, he con&s;ented that Dil&ecirc;re &s;hould be

He was al&s;o informed, by his friends  in the camp, that the principal officers were &s;hut up in council with the prince. He &s;truck his tents in the night, and, marching on &s;ilently, took a circuit round the other &s;ide of the city, and when morning appeared, he was heard of above thirty miles from Aurungab&acirc;d, on the road to Delhi. The prince, being informed of the flight of Dil&ecirc;re, was violently tran&s;ported with rage. He marched &s;uddenly in pur&s;uit of the fugitive; but he was &s;o much retarded by his numbers, which, including the followers of the camp, amounted to two hundred thou&s;and men, that in a few days, he found that Dil&ecirc;re had out&s;tripped him above fifty miles. He &s;elected a part of his army, and leaving the heavy baggage behind, continued the pur&s;uit with great vivacity. His officers did not, however, &s;econd the warmth of the prince.

He wrote, from that city, letters to his father. He pretended that he had only executed the orders of the emperor, in pur&s;uing Di|l&ecirc;re. Aurungz&ecirc;be &s;eemed &s;atisfied with this excu&s;e. His &s;on was formidable, and he re&s;olved by degrees to dive&s;t him of his dangerous power. A rebellion was thus begun and ended with|out &s;hedding blood. The art of the father was con&s;picuous in the &s;on. They looked upon one another with jealou&s;y and fear; and it was remarkable, that when both were in the field, and ready to engage, they had carried their politene&s;s &s;o far as not to utter, on either &s;ide, a &s;ingle word of reproach.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dil&ecirc;re re|warded.</NOTE>The true &s;entiments of Aurungz&eacute;be, however, appeared in the di&s;tingui&s;hing honours which he be&s;towed on Dil&ecirc;re. That lord  had rendered eminent &s;ervices to the empire. In his march to the Decan again&s;t Adil Shaw, he had reduced &s;ome refractory Rajas in the mountains, who having joined in a confederacy, re&s;u&s;ed to pay their tribute. He deviated from his rout into the country of Bundela, and attacked, in his territory, the Raja of Hoda. The &s;poils of the enemy made ample amends for the tribute which had been with-held. Near two millions, in jewels and coin, were re|mitted by Dil&ecirc;re to the Imperial trea&s;ury. The tribute of the re|duced princes was increa&s;ed; and the &s;ucce&s;sful general him&s;elf became rich at the expence of his foes.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion.</NOTE>The general peace which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the empire by  the return of Shaw Allum to his duty, was, in &s;ome degree, di&s;turb|ed by an in&s;urrection of the wild barbarians of the north. The Af|gan tribe of Eu&s;oph Zehi, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the heads of the Attoc and the Nil&acirc;b, ru&s;hed down from their mountains like a torrent, with thirty thou&s;and men. They &s;pread terror and deva&s;tation over all the plains of Punj&acirc;b; having inve&s;ted their chief with the en&s;igns of royalty under the name of Mahommed Shaw. This prince, in the manife&s;toes which he di&s;per&s;ed in his march, averred his own de|&s;cent from Alexander the Great, and a daughter of the king of Tran&s;oxiana. This genealogy was probably fabulous; but the Afgans have high claims on antiquity. A literary people, like the Arabs, and, by their mountains, their poverty, and the peculiar ferocity of their manners, &s;ecured from conque&s;t, they have pre|&s;erved among them many records of ancient authority, and un|doubted credit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Afgans</NOTE>Mahommed Shaw's power of doing mi&s;chief was le&s;s problema|tical  than his high de&s;cent. The news of his ruinous progre&s;s was carried to Aurungz&ecirc;be. He ordered the governor of the adjoining di&s;tricts to hara&s;s the enemy till troops &s;hould march to his aid. The name of this officer was Camil. Impatient of the in&s;ults of the enemy, he re&s;olved to attack them with ten thou&s;and Geikers, whom he had collected from their hills round his &s;tandard. He directed his march toward the ferry of Haran on the Nil&acirc;b, with a determined re&s;olution to give battle to the rebels. The Afgans, equally de&s;irous of engaging, cro&s;&s;ed the river with ten thou&s;and of their be&s;t troops, and advanced impetuou&s;ly again&s;t Camil. Mor&acirc;d, who commanded the van of the Imperial militia, &s;ell in,

Camil, in the mean time, advan|ced with the main body. The battle became ob&s;tinate and doubt|ful. Mahommed behaved with a &s;pirit worthy of his new digni|ty. The re&s;t of his army ha&s;tened to his relief; but before their arrival he was defeated, and he involved the whole in his own flight. The Nil&acirc;b, unfortunately for the fugitives, was four miles in their rear. They were pur&s;ued by Camil to the banks. They plunged into the river. More were drowned than fell by the &s;word. The re&s;t were di&s;&s;ipated; and the in&s;urrection &s;eemed to be entirely qua&s;hed.</P>
<P>Camil, after this &s;ignal victory, entered the country of the re|bels with his army.

They collected an army at the heads of their valleys, and marched down upon the Imperiali&s;ts. Their troops were now more numerous than before, but not le&s;s unfortunate. They fell in, upon their march, with Shum&s;hir, who&s;e army had been augmented to fifteen thou&s;and. The battle was ob&s;tinate; and the Afgans derived their own defeat from their impetuous valour. Strangers to regularity and command, they ru&s;hed, without any form, into the heart of the enemy, and being &s;ingly overcome, all at la&s;t took to flight.

They marched up, through the principal valley, and were met by a third army of Afgans. The rebels, aver&s;e to the delays of war, offered battle upon their fir&s;t appearance before the Imperiali&s;ts. The action was bloody. Ma|hommed Shaw, the pretended de&s;cendant of Alexander, behaved with a bravery not unworthy of his ance&s;tor. He led his mountaineers repeatedly to the charge. Fired with the gallant behaviour of their prince, they were not to be driven from the field. The Imperial|i&s;ts, having &s;uffered much, were upon the point of giving way, when a report that the prince was &s;lain induced the common &s;ol|diers among the rebels to fly. The officers were left in their po&s;ts alone. They formed them&s;elves in &s;quadrons; but they were &s;ur|rounded, and three hundred chiefs came into the hands of the ene|my. The flower of the rebel army fell in this action. Am&icirc;n, in the mean time arriving, pur&s;ued the fugitives through all their almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible vallies; and levelled every thing with the ground but the rocks, into which a few unfortunate Afgans found a refuge from the &s;words of the victors.</P>

The line of his public conduct, in ri&s;ing to the &s;ummit of ambi|tion, has already been followed with &s;ome preci&s;ion; but his private life, which prepared him for the greatne&s;s at which he had now arrived, remains &s;till in the &s;hade.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unfavour|able educa|tion</NOTE>The education of the natives of A&s;ia is confined; that of young  men of di&s;tinction always private. They are &s;hut up in the haram from infancy till their &s;eventh or eighth year; or, if they are per|mitted to come abroad, it is only under the care of eunuchs, a race of men more effeminate than the women whom they guard. Chil|dren, therefore, imbibe in early youth little female cunning and di&s;&s;imulation, with a tincture of all tho&s;e inferior pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices which are improper for public life. The indolence na|tural to the climate, is encouraged by example. They loll whole days on &s;ilken &s;ophas; they learn to make no&s;egays of fal&s;e flow|ers with ta&s;te, to bathe in ro&s;e-water, to anoint them&s;elves with per&s;umes, whil&s;t the nobler faculties of the &s;oul lo&s;e their vigour, through want of cultivation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">of ea&s;tern princes.</NOTE>Princes are permitted, at ten years of age, to appear in the hall  of audience. A tutor attends them, who impo&s;es upon them no re&s;traint. They receive little benefit from his in&s;tructions, and they advance frequently into life without having their minds em|bued with any con&s;iderable knowledge of letters. They are mar|ried to &s;ome beautiful woman at twelve, and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that a boy, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an enchanting play-thing as a young wife, will give much attention to the dry &s;tudy of gram|mar. The abilities of the princes of the hou&s;e of Timur, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, extricated, when they advanced in life, their minds from the effects of this ruinous mode of pa&s;&s;ing youth. The mo&s;t of them were men of letters, and given to inquiry; but their at|tention to the education of their children, could not altogether &s;u|per&s;ede the inherent prejudices of their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Early genius of Aurung|zebe.</NOTE>Shaw Jeh&acirc;n was extremely anxious in training up his &s;ons in all the literature and knowledge of the Ea&s;t. He delivered each of  them into the hands of men of virtue as well as of letters; he rai|&s;ed

the tutors to dignities in the &s;tate, to impre&s;s awe upon their pupils, and to induce them to li&s;ten to their precepts. Au|rungz&ecirc;be, however, was not fortunate in his ma&s;ter. His genius flew before the abilities of the teacher; and the latter, to cover his own ignorance, employed the active mind of the prince in difficult and unprofitable &s;tudies. Being naturally remarkably &s;erious, he gave up his whole time to application. The common amu&s;ements of children gave him no plea&s;ure. He was frequently known, whil&s;t yet he was very young, to retire from the puerile buffoonery of his attendants, to the dry and difficult &s;tudy of the Per&s;ian and Arabic languages. His a&s;&s;iduity prevailed over the dulne&s;s of his tutor, and he made a progre&s;s far beyond his years.</P>

Aurungz&ecirc;be, while yet but twelve years of age, &s;tood con&s;tantly near the throne; and he made re|marks, with uncommon &s;agacity, upon the merits of the cau&s;es which were agitated before his father. The emperor &s;eemed high|ly plea&s;ed at abilities which afterwards ruined his own power.

He exhi|hibited,

upon every occa&s;ion, an utter aver&s;ion to flatterers: he admitted not, into his pre&s;ence, men of di&s;&s;olute manners. The fir&s;t he thought in&s;ulted his judgment, the latter di&s;graced him as the guardian of the morality, as well as of the property, of the people. Mu&s;icians, dancers, and &s;ingers, he bani&s;hed from his court, as foes to gravity and virtue. Mimics, actors, and buffoons, he drove from his palace, as an u&s;ele&s;s race of men.</P>

Religion &s;uited the &s;erious turn of his mind; and he at la&s;t became an enthu&s;ia&s;t through habit.

Though the&s;e were known to exi&s;t, their per&s;ons were not known. The princes, his &s;ons, as well as the other viceroys, were in con&s;tant terror; nor dur&s;t they exerci&s;e the lea&s;t degree of oppre&s;&s;ion again&s;t the &s;ubject, as every thing found its way to the ears of the emperor. They were turned out of their office upon the lea&s;t well-founded complaint; and when they appeared in the pre&s;ence, the nature of their crime was put in writing into their hands. Stript of their e&s;tates and honours, they were obliged to appear every day at court, as an example to others; and after being puni&s;hed for &s;ome time in this manner, according to the degree of their crime, they were re&s;tored to fa|vour; the mo&s;t guilty were bani&s;hed for life.</P>

Naturally mild and moderate through policy, he &s;eemed to forget that they had not been always his friends. When he appeared in public, he clothed his fea|tures with a complacent benignity, which plea&s;ed all. Tho&s;e who had trembled at his name, from the &s;ame of his rigid ju&s;tice, when they &s;aw him, found them&s;elves at ea&s;e.

He remembered the rents, he was thoroughly acquainted with the u&s;ages of every particular di&s;trict. He was wont to write down in his pocket-book, every thing that occurred to him through the day. He formed a &s;y&s;tem|atical knowledge of every thing concerning the revenue, from his notes, to which, upon every nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion, he recurred. The governors of the provinces, and even the collectors in the di&s;tricts, when he examined either, on the &s;tate of ther re&s;pective departments, were afraid of mi&s;repre&s;entation or ignorance.

Men of known abilities, honour, and learning, were appointed to examine into the progre&s;s which the learners made, and to prevent indolence and inattention in the ma&s;ters. Many hou&s;es for the reception of the poor and maimed were erected; which were endowed with a revenue from the crown. The emperor, in the mean time, collected all the books which could

He called them to court; and placed them, according to their abilities, in offices in the &s;tate; tho&s;e, who were ver&s;ed in the commentaries on the Coran, were rai&s;ed to the dignity of judges, in the different courts of ju&s;tice.</P>
