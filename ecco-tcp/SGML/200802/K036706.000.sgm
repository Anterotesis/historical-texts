<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SAUL,</HI> for his Di&s;obedience to Heaven, is afflicted with the Fiend of <HI>MELANCHOLY, p. 1. DAVID</HI> is &s;ent for, to cure him by the Power of Mu&s;ic, <HI>p. 2.</HI> He comes, attended with a Choir of Shepherds; and, as the means of di&s;pelling <HI>SAUL'S</HI> De&s;pair, he &s;ings the Creation of the World, and the happy E&s;tate of our fir&s;t Parents in Paradi&s;e, <HI>p. 3 to 7. SAUL</HI> is moved by the Repre&s;entation; but expo&s;tulates with <HI>DAVID,</HI> "why, when others are happy, He &s;hould be mi&s;erable," <HI>p. 7. DAVID,</HI> to convince him that Guilt is the Source of Mi&s;ery, &s;ings the Fall of Man, and his Expul&s;ion from Paradi&s;e, <HI>p. 8.</HI> This alarms the Monarch's Pride; and in&s;tead of reclaiming, provokes him to Re&s;entment and Rage, <HI>p. 9. DAVID,</HI> &s;uperior to his Threats, awakens his Con&s;cience, and terrifies him, by &s;inging the Fate and Puni&s;hment of Guilt, in the De&s;truction of the rebellious Tribe of <HI>CHORAH</HI> by an Earthquake, and of the guilty World by the gene|ral Deluge, <HI>p. 10. SAUL,</HI> &s;truck with Horror, at|tempts to kill him&s;elf, <HI>p. 13.</HI> But being prevented by his Friends, <HI>DAVID</HI> &s;ooths his Angui&s;h, by invoking Repentance and divine Mercy to compo&s;e his Pa&s;&s;ions,
<PB REF="3">
<HI>p. 14. SAUL</HI> relents into virtuous Sorrow, <HI>p. 15.</HI> But his De&s;pair returning, <HI>DAVID</HI> calls on his at|tendant Choir to rai&s;e a more &s;ublime and affecting Strain, <HI>p. 16.</HI> This hath its Effect; and <HI>SAUL</HI> melts into Tears of Penitence, <HI>ib. DAVID</HI> now comforts him with the Return of the divine Favour, <HI>p. 17.</HI> To bani&s;h the Remains of Pride, he then &s;ings his own Happine&s;s in the humble Station of a Shepherd, <HI>ib.</HI> Still farther to compo&s;e the Monarch's Griefs, by a Strain of &s;oft Mu&s;ic he throws him into a gentle Slumber; invoking cele&s;tial Vi&s;ions to tran&s;port him to the Regions of the Ble&s;&s;ed, and change his Angui&s;h into Joy, <HI>p. 18.</HI> The de&s;ired Effects appear in his Countenance: The Fiend departs: And <HI>SAUL</HI> awakes in perfect Tranquillity, <HI>p. 19. DAVID</HI> then con|cludes with a Song of Triumph on the Powers of Harmony, and the &s;eraphic Hymn that attended her, as the Mini&s;ter of Heaven, on the Creation of the World, <HI>p. 20.</HI></P>
