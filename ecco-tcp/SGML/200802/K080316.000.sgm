<P>OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE of the HIGHWAYS, AND On the LAWS for Amending and Keeping them in REPAIR;</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Reflections contained in the following Pages, are the Re&s;ult of an Enquiry to which my Duty led me, wherein the Nece&s;|&s;ity
<PB N="4" REF="3">
of an Alteration is &s;ugge&s;ted in a Branch of the Statute-Laws of great Importance to the internal Intere&s;ts of this Nation; and a Propo&s;al for an Amendment of tho&s;e Laws, is humbly &s;ubmitted to that Authority, in which alone the Power of enacting and re|pealing Statutes re&s;ides.</P>
<P>It is not in Behalf of a Book, but as the Advocate of the indu&s;trious Poor, the Sinews, the Mu&s;cles of the Body politic, and as the Friend of Agricul|ture and Manufactures, the mo&s;t inno|cent and laudable Means of national Greatne&s;s, that I pre&s;ume to addre&s;s your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Relation which your Lord&s;hip, by an Office of great Tru&s;t and Ho|nour, bears to a County, that, with|out

<P>Permit me therefore, my Lord, &s;o far only as it &s;hall &s;eem likely to produce any Benefit to the Public, to intreat your Lord&s;hip's Protection for the fol|lowing Propo&s;al; as I am firmly per|&s;uaded, that if it meets with Approba|tion,

your Lord&s;hip's Wi&s;dom and Hu|manity will &s;ugge&s;t the Means of ren|dering that Benefit as exten&s;ive and ef|fectual as po&s;&s;ible. I am with great Re&s;pect,</P>

<P>THE Bill to which the following Ob&s;ervations are an Introduction con&s;i&s;ts,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Of tho&s;e Clau&s;es in the &s;everal Acts of Parliament now in Force which have been found mo&s;t u&s;eful, with &s;ome few Variations.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Of &s;uch new Clau&s;es as &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary for an&s;wering the Ends now propo&s;ed: The&s;e latter are printed in a different Character from the Re&s;t of the Bill, and are recommended to the Con&s;ideration, in the approaching Rece&s;s of Parliament, of tho&s;e Members of either Hou&s;e, who whether in Bu&s;ine&s;s or Retirement are equally &s;olicitous to promote the public Good, and who knowing that the Meaning and Operation of legal Language is one of the mo&s;t evane&s;cent Subjects that the human Mind is conver&s;ant with, will employ their Talents in detecting any of tho&s;e in|formal Expre&s;&s;ions which often defeat the Pur|po&s;es of the be&s;t intended Laws.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
The general Form of the <HI>BILL</HI> was &s;ugge&s;ted by a ca&s;ual View of an anonymous Pamphlet, pub|li&s;hed almo&s;t Thirty Years ago, under the Title of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A Scheme for reducing all the Laws relating to the common Highways into one Act of Par|liament;"</Q> and &s;aid in the Preface to have been written by a Gentleman in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, who had made the Amendment of the Highways his principal Care for many Years. But this Scheme con&s;i&s;ting merely of a Draught of a Bill for that Purpo&s;e, not very artificial in its Con&s;truction, very little A&s;&s;i&s;tance could be de|rived from it more than regarded the Selection and Arrangement of the Clau&s;es in former Sta|tutes, proper to be retained in any future Law; and as not only the Method of impo&s;ing and ap|portioning the Statute-Duty, now recommended, is widely different from that Author's, but every Section contained in his Scheme has been both for|mally and &s;ub&s;tantially varied, and the Preamble, and almo&s;t every one of the additional Clau&s;es new drawn, the Author of the pre&s;ent Publication fears he has made him&s;elf an&s;werable for what|ever may be found ami&s;s in the Bill as it now &s;tands.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in e&s;timating the Price of a Day's Labour at one Shilling and Six-pence, he has ex|ceeded the u&s;ual Rate; if this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, let it be remembred that he had an Eye to the
<PB N="9" REF="8">

<P>If it &s;hould be thought eligible, notwith&s;tand|ing the Rea&s;ons within given to the contrary, to annihilate the Statute-Duty, the Bill may be ea&s;ily adapted to that End: But this the Public may be a&s;&s;ured of, that every Attempt to amend the Highway-Laws by additional or explanatory Acts, will produce great Confu&s;ion among tho&s;e who&s;e Duty it is to execute them; and that nothing can remedy the Evils at pre&s;ent complained of, but the Con&s;olidation into one Act of the mo&s;t effica|cious Clau&s;es contained in tho&s;e now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE STATE of the HIGHWAYS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Attention of the Public, not|with&s;tanding it has been engaged by an Object of the utmo&s;t Importance, has of late Years been employed to a very extraordinary Degree in the Repair and Im|provement of the Public Roads in this and the neighbouring Kingdom. Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Profe&s;&s;ions, the Philo&s;opher and the Mecha|nic, have, with a laudable Emulation, contend|ed who &s;hould mo&s;t promote the Intere&s;t of this Country, by facilitating the Methods of convey|ing its Produce from one End to the other.</P>
<P>Nor is this to be looked upon as any other than a particular Mode of that Benevolence,
<PB N="2" REF="10">
which, if we do not greatly flatter our&s;elves, is at pre&s;ent the di&s;tingui&s;hing Characteri&s;tic of the Inhabitants of this I&s;land; a Principle which we have beheld operating in various Ways, and which even now, &s;eeks and &s;olicits Occa&s;ion for its Exertion.</P>
<P>A Di&s;po&s;ition more favourable to any Propo|&s;al calculated either to remove a public Griev|ance, or produce any po&s;itive Good, is not to be wi&s;hed for; and it is hoped, that that contained in the following Pages may be thought to have a Tendency to promote one or other of tho&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>It is too obvious to need in&s;i&s;ting on, that very little of the Concern which has of late been &s;hewn about the Roads in general, has been di|rected to tho&s;e which lead from Pari&s;h to Pa|ri&s;h, and are not the ordinary Channel of Con|veyance to Cities and Towns of great Trade. The Invention of Turnpikes is manife&s;tly calcu|lated for great Roads; which, as they are made in Favour of Commerce, produce a Revenue &s;ufficient to keep them in Repair; but the for|mer have been left to the Care of the Surveyors of the Highways in their re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, &s;ub|ject to the Direction and Controul of the Ju&s;tices of Peace, who&s;e Authority in this Branch of their Juri&s;diction is of &s;uch a Nature, that it car|ries the Appearance of great Oppre&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="3" REF="11">
can &s;eldom be exerted to any beneficial Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>In what Manner, and by whom, the High|ways were anciently repaired, does not at this Time clearly appear: it is probable, that while the Feudal Law &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in its greate&s;t Vi|gour, and the Number of Va&s;&s;als was greater than it has been at any Time &s;ince the Introduc|tion of Manufactures and Commerce among&s;t us, that the ba&s;er Tenures, particularly that of Villenage, might oblige the inferior Cla&s;s of Peo|ple to this Duty; and this Opinion &s;eems to be warranted by a Pa&s;&s;age of an Author of very re|&s;pectable Authority, whereby it appears, that the Judges had in Charge to enquire, among other Things, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of common Highways de&s;troy|ed, or otherwi&s;e in bad Repair, who is bound to repair and amend them; and &s;uch as are pre&s;ented &s;hall be attached by per&s;onal Di&s;tre&s;s to appear; and if it be found on their Appear|ance in Court, that they hold certain Tene|ments of the King upon Condition that they repair &s;uch Way, the &s;aid Tenements are to be &s;ei&s;ed into the King's Hands, and the She|riffs are to an&s;wer for the I&s;&s;ues, and to cau&s;e the Repairs to be done: and where there is no Tenement held of the King by the Perform|ing, &s;uch Per&s;ons as are bound to repair the Ways, and have not di&s;charged their Duty, are to be in the King's Mercy; and the She|riff
<PB N="4" REF="12">
is to be commanded, that he cau&s;e them to be di&s;trained by their Cattle and by their Chattels, and to detain the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es until they have amended the Defects."</Q> <HI>Britton, cap.</HI> 20. <HI>De plu&s;ors Tortz.</HI></P>
<P>The Statute of <HI>Winton,</HI> 13 <HI>Edw.</HI> I. &s;eems to have been made but in Affirmance of this Law, for thereby the Lord is <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to abate certain Nu|&s;ances in the Highways leading from one Mar|ket-Town to another, or be fined at the King's Plea&s;ure; he is al&s;o to fell the Under|woods in &s;uch Highways, and for that Pur|po&s;e is to have the Aid of the Country.</Q></P>
<P>But the earlie&s;t Statute of which the Law now &s;eems to take Notice, is that of 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3 <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 8. which, after creating an Office till then unknown to our Con&s;titution, that of Surveyors of the Highways, proceeds to direct the Manner of their Election and Choice, in Terms which import</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Con&s;table and Churchwardens of every Pari&s;h &s;hall yearly upon <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> or <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Week call together a Number of the Pari&s;hioners, and &s;hall elect two of the Pari&s;h to be Surveyors for one Year of the Works for amending of the Highways leading to any Market-Town, which Per&s;ons &s;hall have Authority to order and direct the
<PB N="5" REF="13">

<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 2. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the Con&s;table and Church|wardens &s;hall then al&s;o appoint four Days for amending the Highways before the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and &s;hall openly in the Church the next <HI>Sunday</HI> after <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> give Knowledge of the &s;ame four Days; and upon the &s;aid Days the Pari&s;hioners &s;hall endeavour them&s;elves to the Amending of the Highways, and &s;hall be chargeable thereto as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> Every Per&s;on for every Ploughland in Tillage, or Pa&s;ture, that he or &s;he &s;hall occupy in the Pari&s;h, and every other Per&s;on keeping there a Draught or Plough, &s;hall &s;end at every Day and Place appointed, one Wain or Cart furni&s;hed after the Cu&s;tom of the Coun|try with Oxen, Hor&s;es, or other Cattle; and all other Nece&s;&s;aries to carry Things conveni|ent; and al&s;o two able Men with the &s;ame, upon Pain of every Draught making Default, 10<HI>s.</HI> And every other Hou&s;holder, Cottager, and Labourer, able to labour, and being no hired Servant by the Year, &s;hall by them|&s;elves, or one &s;ufficient Labourer, upon every of the &s;aid four Days, work in the Amend|ment of the Highways, upon Pain to lo&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="14">
for every Day 12<HI>d.</HI> and all the &s;aid Per&s;ons and Carriages &s;hall do their Works as they &s;hall be appointed by the Supervi&s;ors eight Hours of every of the &s;aid Days, unle&s;s they be otherwi&s;e licen&s;ed by them. And the Stewards of every Leet &s;hall have Power to enquire, by the Oaths of the Suitors, of all Offences again&s;t this Statute, and to a&s;|&s;&s;e&s;s Fines and Amerciaments as &s;hall be thought meet by the Steward; and in Default of &s;uch Enquiry or Pre&s;entment, the Ju&s;tices of Peace &s;hall have Authority to enquire of the &s;ame Offences at their Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions, and to a&s;&s;e&s;s Fines as they or any two of them, whereof one to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> &s;hall think meet; and the Steward of every Leet &s;hall make e&s;treats indented of the Fines and Amer|ciaments for the Defaults pre&s;ented before him, and &s;hall deliver one Part thereof &s;ealed and &s;igned by him to the Bailiff or High Con&s;table of every Hundred, and the other Part to the Con&s;table and Churchwardens of the Pari&s;h wherein the Defaults were made; the &s;ame to be yearly delivered within Six Weeks after the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and the Clerk of the Peace &s;hall make like E&s;treats of the Fines and Amerciaments for the Defaults pre&s;ented before the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and deliver the &s;ame as afore&s;aid; which E&s;treats &s;hall be &s;ufficient Warrant to the Bailiff or
<PB N="7" REF="15">
chief Con&s;table to levy the Amerciaments and Fines by Di&s;tre&s;s; and if no &s;ufficient Di&s;tre&s;s can be found, or the Offender &s;hall refu&s;e to pay the Amerciament or Fine, and do not pay the &s;ame within twenty Days after De|mand, &s;uch Per&s;on to forfeit double the Sum that he &s;hould have paid."</Q></P>
<P>The Statute above cited was to continue in Force for Seven Years, but being &s;uffered to ex|pire, it was revived by 5 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 13. and by 29 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 5. it was made perpetual.</P>
<P>There is great rea&s;on to think that the&s;e Pro|vi&s;ions of the Law fell very far &s;hort of produ|cing the Ends propo&s;ed by them, &s;ince we find that the Repair of Bridges, Cau&s;ways, and Highways, even after the Time of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> was deemed a laudable Exertion of public Spirit. <HI>Sutton,</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI> be|queathed by his Will great Sums for Pur|po&s;es of this Sort. The Te&s;taments of wealthy People, who died before the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, afford many other Examples of the like Nature; and many Corporations are Feoffees of Lands charged with the perpetual Repair of public Roads in different Parts of the King|dom.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that the Beneficence of this Nation, has, at &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Periods, been directed
<PB N="8" REF="16">
to very different Objects. The Building of Churches, and the Endowment of Mona&s;teries, were the fir&s;t In&s;tances of public Charity of which we have any Memorials. The Di&s;&s;olution of Religious Hou&s;es, and the Reformation which immediately followed, furni&s;hed Motives to the Erection of Seminaries for Learning. To this &s;uc|ceeded the Foundation and Endowment of Alms-Hou&s;es, after that the Building of Charity Schools, and la&s;t of all Ho&s;pitals; &s;o that for this Rea&s;on, and perhaps, becau&s;e the Law has taken them under its Care, we now &s;eldom hear of any pri|vate Donations for repairing the Highways.</P>
<P>We &s;ee that by the Statute of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> the Per&s;ons bound to contribute, either by Labour or in Money to the Amendment of the High|ways are divided into two Cla&s;&s;es; the fir&s;t where|of con&s;i&s;ts of</P>
<P>Such as occupy a Ploughland in Tillage or Pa&s;ture within the Pari&s;h, and</P>
<P>Every other Per&s;on keeping there a Draught or Plough.</P>
<P>The&s;e are to &s;end, at every Day and Place ap|pointed, one Wain or Cart, with Oxen, Hor&s;es, or other Cattle, and two Men, on Pain of every Draught making Default, 10<HI>s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17">
The &s;econd Cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of</P>
<P>Every Hou&s;holder, Cottager, and Labourer, able to labour, and being no hired Servant by the year, who are required by them&s;elves, or one &s;ufficient Labourer for every of them, on every of the &s;aid Days, to work in the Amendment of the Highways, upon Pain to lo&s;e for every Day 12<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we may ob&s;erve every Individual in the Kingdom, from the yearly hired Servant up|wards, is required to contribute to this nece&s;&s;ary Work; and that tho&s;e Land-Holders, who, by occupying le&s;s than a Ploughland, and keeping no Draught or Plough, are not comprehended within the fir&s;t de&s;criptive Clau&s;e, are yet reach|ed by the &s;econd; and we may very rea&s;onably infer, that had there been, at the Time of ma|king the Statute, as there is now, any Rank of Men equally capable in re&s;pect of their Wealth, of contributing to the Amendment of the High|ways with tho&s;e de&s;cribed by the fir&s;t Clau&s;e, and yet not included in it; that in that Ca&s;e the Legi&s;lature would, by a few Words, have ex|tended that Clau&s;e to them, and not tacitly have ranked &s;uch Per&s;ons with Hou&s;holders, Cotta|gers, and Labourers able to labour.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="18">
It is true, that even at the Time of making this Statute, it was not univer&s;ally agreed what Quantity of Land a Ploughland contained, and that the Antiquaries and Lawyers entertained different Opinions about that Matter. My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> has &s;aid, that a Carve or Hide of Land, or a Ploughland, which is all one, is not of any certain Content, but &s;o much as one Plough may plough in one Year; and &s;o in &s;ome Coun|tries it is more, and in others le&s;s, according to the Heavine&s;s of the Soil. 9 <HI>Coke's Rep.</HI> 124. <HI>Lowe's Ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Others a&s;&s;ert a Difference between a Hide and a Carve or Ploughland; for they &s;ay, that a Hide of Land contains four Ploughlands, or 480 Acres; whereas a Carve or Ploughland contains but 120 Acres, or four Yardlands of thirty Acres each: others again maintain a Carve or Ploughland to be an indefinite Mea&s;ure, <HI>quantum aratrum arare pote&s;t in oe&s;tivo tempore.</HI> Vide <HI>Skene, Min&s;heu,</HI> and <HI>Norden's Surveiour's Dialogue.</HI> However, this Controver&s;y is now at an End, the Statute of 7 <HI>Will.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 29. having &s;ettled that 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year &s;hall be deemed a Ploughland.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood the Law till the Time of Queen <HI>Eliz.</HI> in the 5th, 18th, and 39th of who&s;e Reign three &s;everal Statutes were made for the Repair of Highways. By that of the 5th, <HI>cap.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="19">
13. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 8. the Surveyors are required <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"within one Month next after Default made contrary to the Statute of 2 <HI>&amp;</HI> 3 <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> or this Act, to pre&s;ent &s;uch Default to the next Ju|&s;tice of the Peace, upon Pain to forfeit 40<HI>s.</HI> and &s;uch Ju&s;tice &s;hall certify the &s;ame Pre|&s;entment at the next General Se&s;&s;ions, upon Pain to forfeit 5<HI>l.</HI> and the Ju&s;tices of the Peace &s;hall have Authority to enquire of any &s;uch Default or Offence at their Quarter-Se&s;|&s;ions, and to a&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch Fines for the &s;ame as they or any two of them, whereof one to be of the <HI>Quorum,</HI> &s;hall think meet."</Q> The principal End of the Statutes of 18 <HI>&amp;</HI> 39 <HI>Eliz.</HI> was the Clearing up certain Doubts that had ari&s;en upon the Con&s;truction of the former Sta|tute, to inve&s;t the Surveyors with more exten&s;ive Powers, particularly, as to providing Materials, and to increa&s;e the Number of Days Labour from four to &s;ix. Indeed one of the&s;e Statutes, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the 18th of the Queen, <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 2. enacts, that every Per&s;on (except &s;uch as dwell in <HI>London</HI>) that &s;hall be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to any Sub&s;idy, to 5<HI>l.</HI> in Goods, or 40<HI>s.</HI> in Land or above, being none of the Parties chargeable for the Amend|ment of the Highways by any former Law, but as a Cottager, &s;hall find two able Men yearly to labour in the Highways at &s;uch Times as by the &s;aid Statute are appointed. But how far this Law can be &s;aid to be in Force, now the
<PB N="12" REF="20">
Method of rai&s;ing Money by Sub&s;idy is di&s;con|tinued, is Matter of Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But afterwards, upon Con&s;ideration, it was found, that in many Places of the Kingdom there was no U&s;e for Carts and Teams, but that the Practice was to carry Materials on Hor&s;es Backs, or by other Kinds of Carriage; it is therefore by 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 8. enacted,</P>
<P>That in &s;uch Places the Inhabitants &s;hall &s;end in &s;uch their Hor&s;es as are accu&s;tomed to that Labour, and their other Carriages as by any for|mer Statute is appointed for Carts.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 9. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If any Per&s;on &s;hall fail to make their Days Labour for repairing the High|ways, or neglect to &s;end their Carriages, it &s;hall be lawful for the Surveyors to make Complaint to the next Ju&s;tices of the Peace, who are required, upon Proof, by Oath of one Witne&s;s, to levy by Di&s;tre&s;s and Sale of the Goods of every Per&s;on failing as afore&s;aid (and not having a rea&s;onable Excu&s;e to be allowed by the Ju&s;tices) the Penalties here|after mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> for every Day Labourer 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> for every Man and Hor&s;e 3<HI>s.</HI> and for every Cart with two Men 10<HI>s.</HI> for every Day; which Penalties &s;hall be employed for repairing the Highways."</Q></P>

<P><PB N="20" REF="28">
Before we proceed to point out the various Ways by which the &s;alutary Purpo&s;es of the Legi&s;lature may be, and are defeated; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire how far the Laws now under Con&s;i|deration do at this Day con&s;i&s;t with that Ju&s;tice and Equality with a View to which they were originally framed. The intelligent Reader need not be told, that the frequent U&s;e, if not the Invention of Coaches, and all tho&s;e various Spe|cies of Wheel-Carriage, the &s;ole End whereof is the Conveyance of Per&s;ons from one Place to another, is of far le&s;s Antiquity than the fir&s;t of the Statutes above cited; and it is far from being Matter of ab&s;olute certainty, that a Cart drawn by <HI>two</HI> Hor&s;es only, is in Con&s;truction of Law a Draught.</P>
<P><HI>Dalton,</HI> who wrote before the Year 1619, &s;eems to make it a Que&s;tion whether it is or no, when he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find that a Draught for the King's Carriages heretofore hath been &s;ome|times with two Hor&s;es, as it &s;eemeth by the Statute of <HI>Magna Charta, cap.</HI> 21."</Q> (The Words of the Statute be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No Sheriffe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall take the Hor&s;es or Carts of any Per&s;on for Carriage, except he pay for one Cart with two Hor&s;es Ten-pence by the Day, and for a Cart with three Hor&s;es Fourteen-pence by the Day); and therefore I think him that u&s;ually goeth to Cart for his own Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="29">
with two Hor&s;es, to be chargeable to find a Cart and two Hor&s;es for the Amending of the Highways, and to carry &s;uch Loads as his two Hor&s;es are well able to draw."</Q></P>
<P>Here we &s;ee the Author above quoted driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of rea&s;oning from Analogy, in Order to &s;hew that a Cart which is con&s;tantly u&s;ed for the Purpo&s;es of Hu&s;bandry, and was an Implement in u&s;e &s;o long ago as <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> if drawn but with two Hor&s;es, is a Draught within the Meaning of the Statute of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> and after all, his Opinion does not &s;eem (as &s;ome others of his have) to have been adop|ted by any &s;ub&s;equent Statute, or e&s;tabli&s;hed by any Judicial Determination.</P>
<P>If this then is the Ca&s;e in the In&s;tance above|mentioned, what are we to think of that of <HI>Coaches, Chariots,</HI> and <HI>Po&s;t-Chai&s;es,</HI> which have no Relation to Agriculture or Hu&s;bandry, and were &s;carcely known at the Time of making the Statute? Or indeed, if we con&s;ider that the Occupiers of &s;uch Carriages are, throughout the Kingdom, exempted from the greater Statute-Duty, what can we think, but that there is no Law in Being, which, in re&s;pect to the Statute-Labour required of each of them, does di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t Rank of Subjects?</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="30">
It has indeed been a&s;&s;erted, though on very &s;lender Authority, that this Matter did once re|ceive the Determination of Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> who&s;e Opinion is &s;aid to have been, that Coaches and Chariots were included under the Appellation of a Draught, and that &s;uch as kept them were liable to do Statute-Duty in like Manner as tho&s;e who kept Teams: but we have no authentic Report of any &s;uch Deter|mination; and the Practice throughout the King|dom is to con&s;ider &s;uch Per&s;ons merely as Hou&s;e|holders.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome Propo&s;itions &s;o evident, that they are incapable of Demon&s;tration; for which Rea&s;on it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that as the Law now &s;tands, a Nobleman of the highe&s;t Rank that does not occupy 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year in Land, or keep a Team, (and there are many who do neither) and who is continually wearing the Highways with his Hor&s;es and his Carriages, is legally chargeable with Six Days Labour in a Year, or the Pay|ment of Nine Shillings in Lieu thereof; and that the poor Day-Labourer, the Cottager, who has a Wife, and perhaps three or four Infant Chil|dren to feed and clothe, who&s;e only u&s;e of the public Highway is the walking on it to and from his daily Labour, is chargeable preci&s;ely to the &s;ame Amount.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31">
My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> &s;omewhere ob&s;erves, that tho&s;e Laws which impo&s;e a Penalty di&s;proportionate to the Offence, are very &s;eldom executed; and the Rea&s;on is, that in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, the gene|ral Humanity both of tho&s;e that &s;hould inform, and tho&s;e that &s;hould convict, interpo&s;es; and &s;o the Offender e&s;capes with Impunity. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of every Law that &s;eems to be either unnece&s;&s;arily or inadequately &s;evere; and to apply this Ob&s;ervation to the Ca&s;e now be|fore us, we find that the lower Cla&s;s of tho&s;e who are charged with Six Days manual Labour, from a Sen&s;e of the Hard&s;hip of &s;uch a Burthen, either do it partially, or not at all; and in the latter Ca&s;e, being Contuments, they are liable to the Penalties, and &s;o become amenable to the Ju&s;tices for their Neglect.</P>
<P>The Power of the Ju&s;tices in mitigating the Severity of the Law, is re&s;trained to very few Ca&s;es; the <HI>rea&s;onable Excu&s;e</HI> which the Statutes of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 9. and 1 <HI>Geo. cap.</HI> 52. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 2. allow, cannot operate in the Ca&s;e of a Per&s;on whom the Law has expre&s;sly charged, and &s;uch as are unable to labour are &s;pecifically di&s;charged. To whom then are the Ju&s;tices to extend this their Clemency? perhaps after all, to tho&s;e few Per&s;ons only, who&s;e &s;hort Re&s;idence in a Pari&s;h would make it unrea&s;onable to charge them with any Statute-Duty. If then the Ju&s;ti|ces
<PB N="24" REF="32">
are bound to i&s;&s;ue their Warrant again&s;t every poor Defaulter for the whole of the Nine Shil|lings, and if every Commutation or Compo&s;ition be, as undoubtedly it is, illegal; let it be con&s;i|dered how reluctantly this Power mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be executed, and how much it is the Inte|re&s;t of every poor Man, rather than conform to the Law to di&s;obey it, and tru&s;t to all the Chances in his Favour that it will never be exe|cuted again&s;t him.</P>
<P>With all due Deference, therefore, to the Wi&s;dom of tho&s;e concerned in framing them, we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the Laws now under Con&s;ideration, are at this Day, at lea&s;t, incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e general Principles of Ju|&s;tice and Equity, from which every Law in the E&s;timation of good Men, is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its Authority.</P>
<P>Nor does the Statute of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> appear at all more defen&s;ible, if we con&s;ider it in a <HI>politi|cal</HI> View: A Law without a Sanction is but a dead Letter, and &s;uch does that appear to be, which we are now con&s;idering. Suppo&s;e a Far|mer is required by the Statute, as occupying a Ploughland, or keeping a Draught, to &s;end a Team to work Six Days on the Highways, and that he is aver&s;e to the Performance of this Duty, what is the legal Motive to Obedience in this Ca&s;e? The An&s;wer is, the Fear of incur|ring
<PB N="25" REF="33">
the Penalty; but perhaps it may be more his Intere&s;t to incur the Penalty, than to avoid it. Let us con&s;ider whether it is or not.</P>
<P>The Labour of a Cart, a Team, and one Man, is in mo&s;t Places e&s;timated at Ten Shillings a Day; If the Farmer lets them out to a neigh|bouring Gentleman, they will earn the Owner that Money; but if he &s;ends his Cart and Team with two Men to work on the Highways, the Labour of them all will excu&s;e him from the Pay|ment of no larger a Sum: &s;o that if he lets out his Team and incurs the Forfeiture, he &s;aves the Labour of one Man, and the Statute is &s;o far from being penal in this Re&s;pect, that it is preg|nant with a Motive to Di&s;obedience; and this is certain, that no Man will ever &s;end his Cart and Team to Highway-work, if he can either let them out or find Employment for them at Home.</P>
<P>In like Manner may the Day-Labourer argue with him&s;elf, and conclude, that if he mu&s;t either actually perform, or forfeit the Price of Six Days Labour, the latter is as eligible as the former; with this Difference, that if he does his Work, it is a certain Lo&s;s to his Family of a whole Week's Sub&s;i&s;tence; whereas, if he omits it, the Payment of the Penalty is con|tingent.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="34">
This Defect, it mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, is owing &s;olely to the Diminution in the Value of Money &s;ince the enacting the Statute now under Con&s;ideration. Bi&s;hop <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> in his <HI>Chronicon Pretio&s;um, cap.</HI> V. has &s;hewn, that in 1514. which was not a great many Years before this Statute was made, the Wages of a Labourer from <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> except in Harve&s;t, were Four-pence; and from <HI>Michael|mas</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> Three-pence by the Day: and though he has not mentioned it expre&s;ly, we may there find Rea&s;ons to conclude, that the Labour of a Waggon and Team with two Men, was worth about Two Shillings and Eight-pence by the Day. And by the Statute it appears, that at that Time, as it is now, the Penalty for every Day's Default of tho&s;e who were to &s;end a Team, was Ten Shillings, and of tho&s;e who were to labour, One Shilling: now, if we compare the&s;e Forfeitures with the re&s;pective Duties they were intended to enforce, we &s;hall find them to have been penal to a &s;ufficient Degree at the Time of making the Statute; but the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It has been urged, that whether the Per&s;on charged does actually perform, or pay the Price of his Duty, the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame to the Public; ina&s;much as the Forfeiture will purcha&s;e ju&s;t as
<PB N="27" REF="35">
much Labour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance as was originally re|quired of him; and if that is done, it is no|thing to the Public what Hands were employed in it.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this, it may be &s;aid, that it &s;eems as if the Makers of the Statute thought otherwi&s;e when they made the Penalty in both Ca&s;es more than treble the Value of the Duty required. Be&s;ides, is it of no Con&s;equence to a State whether the Laws are obeyed or not? we all know, that the increa&s;e of penal Laws is one of the mo&s;t inflaming Topics of popular Cla|mour, and that every additional Statute of that Sort, is an Addition to the Power of factious and de&s;igning Men to di&s;tre&s;s a Government. Is it not, therefore, of &s;ome Importance to the State whether a Law, which has &s;olely the public Good for its Object, is con&s;tantly to wear the Face of a remedial or a penal one?</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee in what Manner the Law at pre&s;ent under Con&s;ideration is ob&s;erved in tho&s;e few Pari&s;hes, where the Inhabitants are di&s;po&s;ed to yield Obedience to the Letter of it; the Days for performing the Statute-Duty are &s;o far from being con&s;idered as Days of Labour, that as well the Farmers as the common Day-Labourers, have long been u&s;ed to look on them as Holidays, as a kind of Rece&s;s from their ac|cu&s;tomed
<PB N="28" REF="36">
Labour, and devoted to Idlene&s;s and its concomitant Indulgences of Riot and Drunken|ne&s;s. Be&s;ides, as this Labour, where it is perform|ed, may in &s;ome Degree be &s;aid to be voluntary, we are not to wonder, if &s;uch as employ them|&s;elves in it are le&s;s obedient to the Directions of tho&s;e whom the Law has appointed to &s;uperin|tend it, than is con&s;i&s;tent with the due Di&s;|charge of their Duty. What is the Benefit a|ri&s;ing from the Labour of twenty Men and as many Hor&s;es, occupied in four or five different Stations within an exten&s;ive Pari&s;h, compared with that of half the Number of each, working under the immediate Direction of an Officer, and executing a Plan which he him&s;elf has con|certed and &s;ees the Tendency and Advantages of?</P>
<P>And this naturally leads us to reflect a little how inadequate in re&s;pect of its Duration, is the Authority of the Surveyors, to the Ends pro|po&s;ed in the In&s;titution of the Office: we will &s;uppo&s;e a Surveyor to be, as the Statute of <HI>Will. &amp; Mar.</HI> requires, a Man of Sub&s;tance, and in|clined to execute the Office faithfully; and that he is what no Statute can make him, a Judge of Roads, and the Art of making and repairing them: whatever Schemes he &s;hall form on his taking on him the Office, he has in Effect but Six Days to execute; we mu&s;t therefore &s;uppo&s;e

that he will hardly think of any Repairs, Alte|rations, or Amendments, but what may be done in that Time, by &s;uch of the Inhabitants as have u&s;ually preferred the doing their Statute-Duty to paying the Forfeiture. Be&s;ides this inevitable Re&s;traint on the Officer in re&s;pect to the Lati|tude of his Operations, we &s;ee he can have no Dependence on tho&s;e who &s;hould execute them; and in Ca&s;e they &s;hould fail to a&s;&s;i&s;t, he, as will be immediately &s;hewn, is de&s;titute of a Re&s;ource.

Defaults in the Hire of Teams and Men, and go on with his Work; very true, but fir&s;t he is to receive them; in Order to which he is to enter upon a new Work; namely, to bring the Defaulters to Ju&s;tice. And fir&s;t he is to make out a Li&s;t of their Names, which when completed, is to be returned to the Se&s;&s;ions, which may po&s;&s;ibly be to be held either in a Week or in four Months after the Offence; the Ju&s;tices upon this Return, of Cour&s;e i&s;&s;ue Summon&s;es for the Defaulters to &s;hew Cau&s;e in a rea&s;onable Time, why they will not pay; after this, if they do not comply, Di&s;tre&s;s-Warrants are i&s;&s;ued, before the Execution whereof the wet Weather &s;ets in, and there is an End of Road-Work for that Year. The Surveyor is then bu&s;ied in making up his Account again&s;t the <HI>January</HI> Se&s;|&s;ions, or perhaps in defending Actions grounded on &s;ome Irregularity in the Notice, the due Publication whereof, or of the re&s;pective De|faults, not one in Fifty of them is ever prepared to prove: when <HI>January</HI> comes, his Account is pa&s;&s;ed, and he pays the Balance to the new Sur|veyor, who will have ju&s;t the &s;ame Difficulties to encounter as his Predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>And yet, perhaps, the wor&s;t Con&s;equences are behind; every one knows, that the Law in general requires, that the Highways through|out the Kingdom &s;hall be kept in Repair by the &s;everal Pari&s;hes of which they are Part. The
<PB N="31" REF="39">
Law has e&s;tabli&s;hed a Form of Proceeding by Way of Indictment again&s;t the Pari&s;hioners, up|on which, if the Defendants are found guilty, they &s;hall not be di&s;charged by &s;ubmitting to a Fine, but a <HI>Di&s;tringas</HI> &s;hall go <HI>in Infinitum</HI> till they repair. This Remedy may &s;eem to have been founded on the Statute of <HI>Winton;</HI> yet by the Pa&s;&s;age above quoted from <HI>Britton,</HI> it ap|pears to have been Part of the antient Common Law of the Realm, of which the Statute is but a Recognition.</P>
<P>The Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz. cap.</HI> 13. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 8, 9. has pre&s;cribed another Method of Proceeding, which, though &s;eemingly different, is in Effect much the &s;ame as that of an Indictment, which is by a Pre&s;entment of the Surveyors to the next Ju&s;tice, who is to certify the &s;ame at the next General Se&s;&s;ions, and the Se&s;&s;ions is imme|diately to enquire of the Defaulters. Now, not|with&s;tanding the &s;eeming Efficacy of the Word <HI>immediately,</HI> yet the general Opinion on that Clau&s;e of the Statute is, that the Certificate of the Ju&s;tice in this Ca&s;e, has not the Effect of a Pre&s;entment, but mu&s;t be turned into an In|dictment; to which, by the Rules of Law, the Offender may enter his Traver&s;e, and no Trial can be had, till the Se&s;&s;ions after.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Methods of Proceeding &s;eems liable to great Objection; for as to the fir&s;t, the
<PB N="32" REF="40">
Law does not di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e who have done, from tho&s;e who have refu&s;ed to do their Statute Work, but pronounces its Judgment indi&s;crimi|nately again&s;t the whole Pari&s;h; from whence fol|lows this apparent Inju&s;tice, that the Innocent and the Guilty are involved in the &s;ame Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>As to the Method of proceeding by Pre&s;entment under the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee that it is not productive of that expeditious Ju&s;tice which the Statute gives Rea&s;on to expect; for &s;uppo&s;e twenty or thirty per&s;ons are required to work on the Highways the Week after <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Se&s;&s;ions, and that they make Default, or refu&s;e to work when they are out, the Surveyor in &s;uch Ca&s;e is by the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> to pre&s;ent the Defaulters to the next Ju&s;tice of the Peace, who is to certify this Pre&s;entment to the next Gene|ral Quarter-Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace, that is the Summer Se&s;&s;ions following, when we will &s;up|po&s;e the Defaulters are indicted; now, if it &s;hould be <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Se&s;&s;ions before this Indictment can be tried, and &s;ooner it cannot well be, here is a whole Summer lo&s;t, and nothing is done to the Repair of the Highways: for, from the Mo|ment a Pro&s;ecution is commenced, a total De|fection is &s;ure to follow, and there is an End of all legal Obedience; and if any Mi&s;take in the Manner of conducting it, or any Defect of Proof &s;hould occa&s;ion a Failure, the Offenders are
<PB N="33" REF="41">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have triumphed over the Law, and it is odds if they ever after do any Duty.</P>
<P>The Delay and Expence of the&s;e Methods of proceeding are Objections common to them both, and it is mo&s;t ardently to be wi&s;hed, that as well for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, as becau&s;e of their Inefficacy, they were either totally aboli&s;hed, or &s;o regula|ted as to be more effectual.</P>
<P>And here it may be proper to take Notice of the Difficulty that the Ju&s;tices are under, with re&s;pect to the Mea&s;ure of their Authority in the Ca&s;e of Non performance of the Statute-Duty; for though it has been &s;aid, that by the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI> the Surveyors are to pre&s;ent the De|faulters to the next Ju&s;tice, who is to certify the Pre&s;entment to the Se&s;&s;ions, yet the &s;ub&s;equent Statute of 22 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 12. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 9. requires the Ju&s;tice on the Oath of one Witne&s;s to levy the Penalties of 10<HI>s.</HI> and 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing which, <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 12 of the &s;ame Statute directs the &s;ame Method of Proceeding at the Se&s;&s;ions as is pre&s;cribed by the Statute of 5 <HI>Eliz.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the Statute of 3 <HI>Will. &amp; Mar. cap.</HI> 12. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 9. enacts, that all Offences and Ne|glects re&s;pecting the publick Roads be pre&s;ent|ed by the Surveyor on Oath to &s;ome Ju&s;tice of the Peace within the Divi&s;ion: but the Act does not direct what is to be done with the Pre&s;ent|ment,
<PB N="34" REF="42">
nor can any one conclude that the Ju|&s;tice is to certify it, unle&s;s from the Second Section of the Statute, which enacts, that all the former Laws relating to the Highways &s;hall be executed according to the Tenor of tho&s;e Laws.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, the Statute of 1 <HI>Geo. cap.</HI> 52. is &s;o worded, that it &s;eems doubtful whether all the Authority given by former Acts, as to the&s;e Matters, is not taken away, and the Ju|ri&s;diction ve&s;ted in the Special Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is an Inconvenience that attends the Di&s;charge of the Surveyor's Office, different from tho&s;e already enumerated; for, whereas they are &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from Di&s;obedience to the Law, this is the Con&s;equence of a Com|pliance with it. The Statutes direct, that a ge|neral Notice be publi&s;hed in every Pari&s;h, re|quiring the Inhabitants to come in and perform their Statute-Work on the Six &s;everal Days mentioned in &s;uch Notice; &s;uppo&s;e then that they all attend and declare their Readine&s;s to Work, how are the Surveyors to employ them? In mo&s;t Places the getting ready the Materials is a Step nece&s;&s;arily previous to working in the Re|pair of the Highways; Gravel mu&s;t be dug be|fore it can be &s;pread; and till that is done, not only Teams, but more than a few Hands are of no U&s;e; and the Surveyor, by calling out the
<PB N="35" REF="43">
whole Pari&s;h at once, puts him&s;elf in the hope|le&s;s Situation of a Magician, who, according to the vulgar Notion, having rai&s;ed a Spirit whom he cannot employ, is immediately in his Power, and in Danger of being torn in Pieces. There are a few In&s;tances of local Statutes obtained on the Application of particular Pari&s;hes, whereby the Labour is converted into a Rate; and this Me|thod, if it were univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, would un|doubtedly take away this and many other Ob|jections again&s;t the Law as it now &s;tands: but as all the Acts of Parliament &s;ince that of <HI>Phil. &amp; Mar.</HI> have proceeded to enforce the Statute-Duty, and as none of the many various Propo|&s;als for amending the Highways, which have from Time to Time been &s;ubmitted to the Pub|lic, have ventured to a&s;&s;ert the Expediency of annihilating that Duty, we may very ju&s;tly con|clude, that the Rea&s;ons in Favour of it lie deeper than is generally thought; and it would there|fore be great Pre&s;umption in any private Per|&s;on to &s;ay, that the &s;ame Advantages are to be expected from any Rate or A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, as are capable of being produced by a ju&s;t and equi|table Apportionment of the Statute-Duty.</P>
<P>But to return to the Duty of the Surveyor; it has hitherto been admitted, that he is what every one would wi&s;h him to be, a &s;killful Man in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Road-making; but what mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence if we &s;uppo&s;e him to
<PB N="36" REF="44">
be otherwi&s;e? A Farmer, or if he is an Inhabi|tant of a Town, a Trade&s;man, as ignorant of this kind of Bu&s;ine&s;s as Ninety nine Men in every Hundred throughout the Kingdom are found to be, what ble&s;&s;ed Effects are like to follow from a Conte&s;t between Ignorance armed with Au|thority on the one Side, and invincible Ob&s;ti|nacy, to call it perhaps by a wor&s;e Name than it de&s;erves, on the other!</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome, and but a few of the Diffi|culties that attend the Execution of the Survey|or's Office; but what are the&s;e, compared to tho&s;e of the Magi&s;trates, who are to execute the Law in this Re&s;pect, as it now &s;eems to &s;tand? Imagine a Hundred or more of the mo&s;t indi|gent Inhabitants of a Pari&s;h attending to a&s;&s;ign Rea&s;ons for not doing what in natural Ju&s;tice they ought never to have been required to do. Imagine the&s;e Rea&s;ons to be Poverty, a nume|rous Family, a Wife, and four, five, or more &s;mall Children; Sickne&s;s, Lamene&s;s, and an Income of Nine Shillings a Week to provide for them all Food, Raiment, and other Nece&s;|&s;aries, and think whether that Authority is to be envied, which the Magi&s;trates are &s;worn to exert in the enforcing Obedience to perhaps one of the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive Statutes that ever yet received the Sanction of public A&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="45">
In the Cour&s;e of the above Reflections it has been a&s;&s;umed, that the Surveyors are in general di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue the Directions of the Law in the Execution of their Office; but in Truth it is very &s;eldom that they do &s;o: one Error into which they almo&s;t univer&s;ally run, is, the con|&s;idering the re&s;pective Forfeitures for every Day's Default as a <HI>Tax</HI> or <HI>Rate,</HI> than which nothing can be more ab&s;urd; in Con&s;equence whereof their Practice is, as &s;oon as they enter into their Office to a&s;&s;e&s;s <HI>ex Officio</HI> every Inhabitant in a Sum proportionable to the Labour required of him, which they proceed to collect with as little He|&s;itation as the proper Officers do the Poor's Rate; whereas it is evident, that the&s;e &s;everal Sums are not due till the Per&s;ons on whom they are charged have made Default. And this Er|ror naturally induces a general Inattention to the Manner of publi&s;hing the Notice, which they &s;uppo&s;e is to operate again&s;t only a few, and therefore is but little more than Matter of Form.</P>
<P>There are two Mi&s;chiefs that attend this Prac|tice, the one of a private, and the other of a public Nature; the one is, that every Indivi|dual of whom Money has been collected in this Manner, has undoubtedly his Action at Law again&s;t the Surveyor for the Sum &s;o collected of him; the other is, that when the Notice has
<PB N="38" REF="46">
been &s;o negligently given, as that the Publica|tion thereof cannot be proved by an unintere&s;ted Witne&s;s, a Per&s;on not him&s;elf liable to do Sta|tute-Work in the Pari&s;h, who can &s;wear to the Reading it by the Clerk, and is prepared with a Copy of what he heard read, it is odds but every Shilling of the Money forfeited is lo&s;t to the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>This Behaviour of Surveyors, as al&s;o that Corruption which we &s;ee daily practi&s;ed by them in garbling the Inhabitants of a Pari&s;h, commu|ting with them for their Duty, receiving of &s;ome five, of others four Shillings, half a Crown, or what many of them like better, a Bowl of Punch, are puni&s;hable by a Fine of 5<HI>l.</HI> which the Ju&s;tices in their Se&s;&s;ions have Power to im|po&s;e; though a much &s;everer Puni&s;hment-would await an Officer who &s;hould dare to abu&s;e his Tru&s;t in &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P>But this, and many other Evils of the like Na|ture, are in a great Mea&s;ure owing to the Practice of electing Trade&s;men, and Per&s;ons in a Situa|tion nece&s;&s;arily dependent and &s;ubject to Influence, into parochial Offices. There are many Pa|ri&s;hes in this Kingdom, where all the Offices of Churchwarden, Over&s;eer of the Poor, Surveyor of the Highways, and Con&s;table, are borne by a few of the Inferior Inhabitants in a Rotation &s;o quick, as hardly to allow of a &s;ingle Year's Re|&s;pite
<PB N="39" REF="47">
for any one of them; while the Gentle|men, perhaps from a Contempt of an Employ|ment which requires little more than to be able to write and keep a Year's Account, or for other Rea&s;ons, &s;it by and &s;ee the Public de|frauded and the Law eluded. There is an Ob|ligation which every Man is under, who parti|cipates in the Benefits that accrue to Society from Government and Laws, which will render it very difficult for tho&s;e who are qualified, and are un|engaged in Trades or Profe&s;&s;ions, to find an Ex|cu&s;e for &s;uch Supinene&s;s, tho&s;e who can do it are welcome to all the Satisfaction it can afford them. A Method which has been practi&s;ed in &s;ome Pari&s;hes, and is con&s;tantly pur&s;ued in a very con&s;iderable one adjacent to the Metropolis, of joining a Gentleman of large Fortune, or per|haps a Nobleman, with a Trade&s;man, in a pa|rochial Office, has been found to produce con|&s;iderable Advantages; and were it to become univer&s;ally a Fa&s;hion, the Public would &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of its good Effects.</P>
<P>Such are the Inconveniencies the Public feel, and the Hard&s;hips that the lower Cla&s;s of People endure in the &s;everal Particulars above in&s;i&s;ted on; the repeated Complaints of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t affected by the Inequality of the High|way-Laws, have never yet prevailed further than to produce &s;uch Amendments and Alterations from Time to Time as the immediate Exigencies
<PB N="40" REF="48">
of the Ca&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted. How far the Laws in this Re&s;pect are even now &s;hort of that Degree of Perfection which they are capable of being wrought up to, we may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure col|lect from the Sentiments of Mr. <HI>Burn,</HI> who &s;ays that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mo&s;t of the Books are remarkably confu&s;ed under this Title, occa&s;ioned by a Mul|tiplicity of Statutes &s;tanding unrepealed, and yet altered perhaps five or &s;ix Times or oftener, by &s;ucceeding Statutes."</Q> <HI>Burn's Ju&s;tice,</HI> Tit. <HI>Highways,</HI> at the Beginning.&mdash;He afterwards gives his Sen&s;e of this Matter more at large in the fol|lowing Terms; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Notwith&s;tanding that the Wi&s;dom of the Nation hath been employed for above Two hundred Years in redre&s;&s;ing the great Evil of bad Roads, yet, excepting in &s;ome Ca&s;es, where Turnpikes have been erected, the Roads are as bad now as they were in the Days of <HI>Philip &amp; Mary;</HI> and the Defect is in many Places not &s;o much the Want of Hands, as of proper Direction. The &s;ame Multitudes which a&s;&s;emble to demoli&s;h a Turnpike at the Hazard of their Liberty and Lives, are able, and I doubt not would be willing, if rightly in&s;tructed, to make the Roads good without paying Turnpike-Tolls: but the Misfortune is this, although the Laws have provided that the Surveyors &s;hall be cho&s;en out of the more &s;ub&s;tantial Inhabitants, yet when that is done, &s;carce one of them in Five hundred knows how to make a good
<PB N="41" REF="49">
Road; and if he does, his Power continues in Effect but Six Days, and his Succe&s;&s;or pro|bably hath other Schemes and Notions, and the Road is made never the better. Hence it is, that when the People a&s;&s;emble to repair the Highways, if indeed they do a&s;&s;emble, they &s;pend the Time in Diver&s;ions and ma|king Bargains, and other idle Amu&s;ements, and why &s;hould they not? they may as well meet and do nothing, as work hard, and to no Purpo&s;e. And from &s;o many Years Ex|perience the Ca&s;e will never be any otherwi&s;e unle&s;s the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, or others in like Manner, as the Turnpike-Tru&s;tees, &s;hall have Power given to them by Act of Parlia|ment to appoint general Surveyors within pro|per Di&s;tricts, with Salaries, to lay out the Roads, and attend and direct the Work, and &s;ee the Statute-Labour well performed. And this may be effected without any new A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment or Charge: half the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of Six-pence in the Pound, or even le&s;s than half, would be &s;ufficient in many Places both to find Salaries, and to widen and purcha&s;e Roads where needful; and the People, when they &s;hould find the Benefit of their Labour, would work with Chearfulne&s;s.</Q> <HI>Burn's Ju&s;t.

<P>There is nothing in the Pa&s;&s;age above cited that indicates a Nece&s;&s;ity for annihilating the
<PB N="42" REF="50">
Statute-Duty; on the contrary the Author's Pro|po&s;al for an Alteration of the Laws &s;eems to im|ply the Continuance of it; and indeed it is well worthy the Attention of Parliament how far it may be prudent to indulge the People in their pre&s;ent Belief of the Omnipotence of Wealth. The Practice of commuting with Money for Per|&s;onal Services and manual Labour will ever tend to render them Scandalous. <HI>Homer,</HI> who&s;e Writings are &s;uppo&s;ed to exhibit a very ju&s;t Pic|ture of the antient Modes of Living, &s;eems to have thought it no Degradation of a Hero to make him his own Cook; on the contrary, in the pre|&s;ent refined State of human Manners, it would be reproachful for a Per&s;on of but ordinary Rank to perform many of the Functions nece&s;&s;ary to his own Support; the Time may come when Agriculture and other rural Employments will be as di&s;honourable in <HI>England</HI> as they have long been in <HI>Spain;</HI> and when the Evil of bad Roads will be more tolerable than the Di&s;grace of having contributed any otherwi&s;e to the A|mendment of them than by a Di&s;play of that Opulence which &s;eems now to be the mo&s;t de|&s;irable Di&s;tinction between Man and Man. With good Rea&s;on therefore did the antient Policy of our Con&s;titution render the ba&s;e&s;t Services ho|nourable, by converting them into feudal Te|nures, and requiring the Nobility to do that for their Sovereign which they would now di&s;dain to do for them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51">
The Objections which Mr. <HI>Burn</HI> makes are in Truth reducible to two, the Multiplicity of the Laws in the In&s;tance now under Con&s;idera|tion, and the ill Direction of the Power given by them; the latter of the&s;e Inconveniencies may undoubtedly be remedied, by committing that Power to tho&s;e who have no Temptations to abu&s;e it; but the former is an Objection of Weight, is of general Importance; and requires a very &s;erious Attention.</P>
<P>The Statutes relating to the Amendment and Repair of the Highways are not fewer than twelve in Number, made at different Times as Nece&s;&s;ity required, and abounding with Clau&s;es which the utmo&s;t Skill in the Modes of legal rea&s;oning will not enable us to reconcile. Clau&s;es in the older Statutes have been &s;uffered to &s;tand unrepealed, though &s;uch Clau&s;es were altered and amended by &s;ub&s;equent Acts; different Pe|nalties have been inflicted for the &s;ame Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion by different Statutes, all of which are yet &s;uffered to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and thus the Highway Laws have in&s;en&s;ibly accumulated to &s;uch a De|gree as to become a Subject of univer&s;al Com|plaint.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Multiplicity of our Statute Laws has been &s;o long lamented, that Objections of this Sort are looked on as trite; and as they
<PB N="44" REF="52">
contain nothing but what has been urged before, unworthy the public Attention. It is near twenty Years &s;ince <HI>Monte&s;quieu</HI> endeavoured to palliate this Misfortune by remarking, that the Multiplicity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Laws is the Price that the People of that Country pay for their Liberty; but what Equivalent can they expect for that Premium, when the Laws become &s;o numerous, that they cannot be executed; and tho&s;e whom they were intended to bind are thereby in Ef|fect ab&s;olved from their Obedience? what Rea|&s;on there is to fear that this may one Day be the Ca&s;e, will appear on reflecting on the enormous Increa&s;e in the Volume of our Statute Book within the&s;e few Years. Six Years after the Revolution two Folio Volumes contained the public Statutes in Force from <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> By the Seventh Year of the late King they were grown to Six; and at the Expiration of the Thirtieth Year of his Reign, which was Twenty three Years after, they amounted to Nine; during which Period not a &s;ingle Se&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed that did not add &s;everal Sta|tutes to that incredible Number which the Ju&s;ti|ces already had in Charge to &s;ee executed.</P>
<P>What a tremendous Pro&s;pect then has the Ma|gi&s;trate before his Eyes, who re&s;olves to di&s;charge his Duty by the legal and con&s;cientious Exertion of his Authority! <HI>Lambarde,</HI> that learned and &s;aga|cious Writer, and faithful Servant of the Public, in his <HI>Eirenarcha,</HI> written &s;o long ago as the
<PB N="45" REF="53">
Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> enumerates but eight Statutes that concerned the Ju&s;tices of the Peace; which, in his quaint Way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, were then thought, a Load &s;ufficient to break the Back of any Ju&s;tice, and now tho&s;e Statutes are encrea&s;ed to a Number not far &s;hort of Two hundred.</P>
<P>Indeed the Legi&s;lature have in &s;ome few In&s;tan|ces yielded to the pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity of the Times, and con&s;olidated &s;everal Statutes relating to one common Subject, particularly in the Ca&s;es of the Navy and Militia Acts, into one general Law: this Method was originally &s;ugge&s;ted by the great Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> to his Ma&s;ter <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, and we find in the <HI>Journals of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons</HI> 18 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. a Vote <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a Committee be appointed to confer with &s;uch of the Lords the Judges and other Per&s;ons of the Long Robe, who have already taken Pains and made Pro|gre&s;s in peru&s;ing the Statute-Laws, and to con&s;ider of repealing &s;uch former Statute-Laws as they &s;hall find nece&s;&s;ary to be repealed, and of Expedients of reducing all Statute-Laws of one Nature under &s;uch a Method and Head as may conduce to the more ready under&s;tand|ing and better Execution of &s;uch Laws."</Q> <HI>Journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons, Octob.</HI> 4. 18 <HI>Car.</HI> 2.

now in Force relating to the Highways &s;tand in need of a Review; and that tho&s;e Sta|tutes may be &s;o altered, amended, and improved, as to be clear of mo&s;t of the Difficulties that at pre&s;ent ob&s;truct their Execution, that half the Labour and Expence which the Public are at pre&s;ent at, would &s;uffice to keep the Highways in as good Condition as the Turnpike-Roads are now in; and that the Burthen of amending them from Time to Time might be impo&s;ed in &s;uch a Manner as to do no Injury to the Rich, and take away all Po&s;&s;ibility of Complaint from the Poor; and la&s;tly, that an Act of Parliament calculated with the&s;e Views, might be &s;o framed as to be as ea&s;y in its Execution, as laudable in its De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The principal Objects to be attended to in the framing a Law for the&s;e Purpo&s;es, are, that the Burthen thereby to be laid on the Public be pro|portionable to the re&s;pective Circum&s;tances and Abilities of tho&s;e who are to bear it, and that tho&s;e who make the greate&s;t U&s;e of the High|ways &s;hould contribute mo&s;t to keep them in Repair. More particularly Care &s;hould be taken to extend the Qualification of 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year to Hou&s;es, Lands, and every other Species of Te|nement and Hereditament lying, as the Law phra&s;es it, in <HI>Livery.</HI> The Tax on Gentlemen of large per&s;onal E&s;tates, and who keep Coaches, Chariots, and other Wheel-Carriages &s;hould be
<PB N="48" REF="56">
adju&s;ted in a Compound <HI>Ratio</HI> of their Wealth, and the U&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to make of the Highways. Tho&s;e who &s;hall have the Super|intendence of the Highways &s;hould be Per&s;ons of greater Property than are u&s;ually appointed to that Office; and, perhaps it might be expedi|ent to inve&s;t the Ju&s;tices with an Authority to appoint &s;ome one Per&s;on &s;killed in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Road-making as a Kind of perpetual Survey|or, removeable neverthele&s;s at Plea&s;ure, and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hould be for a Salary to lay out the Roads and attend and direct the Work, as tho&s;e do who are appointed by Turnpike Tru&s;tees, and who &s;hall be amenable to the Ju&s;tices, and an&s;werable at Law in like Manner as the Surveyors at pre&s;ent are.</P>
<P>The above Ob&s;ervations &s;ufficiently &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity and the Ju&s;tice of in&s;tituting a new Cla&s;s of Contributors to the Repair of the High|ways; namely, Per&s;ons who keep Coaches, Chariots, or other Wheel-Carriages. When that is done, the Proportions in which they are re|&s;pectively to contribute may be adju&s;ted thus:</P>
<P>Let <HI>Ten</HI> Days be appointed for the Amend|ment of the Highways in&s;tead of <HI>Six,</HI> and let every Per&s;on occupying two or more Ploughlands &s;end a Draught on every of tho&s;e Days, and let him that occupies only one Ploughland &s;end a Draught five Days only, on Pain to forfeit in the fir&s;t

<P>But as all the Inhabitants are not to work on every one of the Ten Days, and to prevent the a&s;&s;embling of more of them than the Surveyors can employ, the Surveyors, be&s;ides publi&s;hing Notice in the Church, &s;hould have Power given them to call out by Summons in Writing the &s;everal Per&s;ons by &s;uch Numbers at a Time as they &s;hall find nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who keep Coaches, Chariots, or Po&s;t-Chai&s;es for their own U&s;e, and not for Hire, and are not charged as Land-holders, &s;hould pay 10<HI>s.</HI> if with four Hor&s;es 15<HI>s.</HI> and if with &s;ix Hor&s;es
<PB N="50" REF="58">
20<HI>s.</HI> a Year, over and above their Proportion of Labour.</P>
<P>This Mode of Taxation, it is to be ob&s;erved, is calculated rather to pre&s;erve the Highways in a continual State of Repair, than to an&s;wer immediate Exigencies; it will therefore be nece&s;&s;ary to continue the Power of making A&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ments in the Manner pre&s;cribed by the Laws now in Force, which Power may be exerci&s;ed either for immediate Improvements, or in Aid of the Statute-Duty.</P>
<P>Something al&s;o &s;hould be done with Re&s;pect to Evidence. It is an unconte&s;ted Rule in Law, that no Per&s;on can be a Witne&s;s to a Fact which will either directly or con&s;equentially affect his own Intere&s;t: The Law in a general View is doubtle&s;s very rea&s;onable that thus di&s;qualifies a Man, and yet his Intere&s;t may be &s;o &s;mall or &s;o remote in a particular In&s;tance, as to contribute no more towards determining his Evidence than a &s;ingle Hair does to the Trepidation of a Scale-Beam capable of &s;u&s;pending a Ton Weight; notwith&s;tanding which the Law knows no Dif|ference in Degree, and its Care to prevent the Operation of in&s;en&s;ible Prejudices is uniformly the &s;ame in all Ca&s;es. How great that Care is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, we may infer from the Conduct of the late Lord <HI>Raymond,</HI> in an In&s;tance yet in the Memory of Per&s;ons now living, who, being Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Court of King's Bench,
<PB N="51" REF="59">
becau&s;e he lived in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Abbot's Langley</HI> in the County of <HI>Hertford,</HI> went off the Bench when an Order relating to that Pari&s;h came be|fore the Court. See <HI>Strange's Reports</HI> 1173. It is doubtle&s;s for Rea&s;ons of this Kind, that a Freeman of a corporate Town is no legal Wit|ne&s;s to a local Cu&s;tom within that Town, and the Practice is for &s;uch a one in that Ca&s;e to &s;uf|fer him&s;elf to be di&s;enfranchi&s;ed before he gives his Evidence. In the Ca&s;e now under Con&s;ide|ration, a Pari&s;hioner who &s;hould &s;wear to any of the Facts which make a Part of that Chain of Evidence requi&s;ite to ju&s;tify a Di&s;tre&s;s on a Defaulter, &s;uch as the Publication of Notice of the Six Days appointed for doing the Statute Work, the Non-Attendance of the Defaulter, the Service of the Summons to &s;hew Cau&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would by &s;uch his Evidence contribute to exonerate the Pari&s;h and him&s;elf as a Pa|ri&s;hioner, from an A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment which the Non|performance of the Statute-Labour might make nece&s;&s;ary; it is therefore apprehended, that no Pari&s;hioner is a competent Witne&s;s in this Ca&s;e, and that even the Pari&s;h-Clerk could not be examined to prove the Publication in his Church of Notice of the Six Days, even though he read it him&s;elf, nor in &s;hort can any one be a Witne&s;s for this Purpo&s;e but a Stranger in the Pari&s;h, or a Servant, or other Per&s;on not liable to do Statute-Duty. We know, that in Favour of Ju&s;tice, the Law has frequently interpo&s;ed to remove legal Di&s;abilities of Witne&s;&s;es and others:
<PB N="52" REF="60">
By a late Statute, the Te&s;timony of Per&s;ons in|tere&s;ted in the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Will is ad|mi&s;&s;able to prove the Execution of it in parti|cular Ca&s;es. By a Statute of 16 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 18. Ju&s;tices may execute the Laws for puni&s;hing Vagrants, repairing the Highways, and the other Laws concerning parochial Taxes, Levies, or Rates, notwith&s;tanding they are rated or chargeable with the Rates within any Place af|fected by &s;uch their Acts. And by 26 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 31. for licen&s;ing Ale-Hou&s;es, any Per&s;on &s;hall be a competent Witne&s;s upon any Infor|mation or Complaint for any Offence again&s;t that Act, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch Per&s;on be an In|habitant of, or charged to the Payment of any Rates for the Relief of the Poor of any Pari&s;h or Place where &s;uch Offence &s;hall be committed, and a Clau&s;e of Two or three Lines would &s;up|ply the Defect here complained of, &s;ave con&s;i|derable Sums, and prevent vexatious Suits in many Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>The Advantages ari&s;ing from the U&s;e of broad Wheels are &s;o apparent, that it would be need|le&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on them; this is certain, that by means of them the Price of Carriage from <HI>York</HI> to <HI>London</HI> has been reduced 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Whe|ther it be not practicable to render the U&s;e of them &s;till more general, may be worthy Con&s;i|deration. At pre&s;ent they are found not to &s;uc|ceed &s;o well in cro&s;s Ways as in the great
<PB N="53" REF="61">
Roads; the former are in mo&s;t Countries &s;o con|fined by the Inclo&s;ures on each Side, as to ad|mit of but one Track; whereas, were Power given to the Ju&s;tices to widen tho&s;e Ways enough to allow of quartering, the U&s;e of broad Wheels would become univer&s;al, and produce the &s;ame Benefit as in the great High Roads; where, as has often been ob&s;erved, they do the Office of a Roller.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chievous Practice of riding in Carts is not yet &s;ufficiently checked by the many Laws lately made to prevent it: certainly there is as much Rea&s;on to empower a Ju&s;tice to convict on a View of this Offence, as in any other Ca&s;e where this Power is given.</P>
<P>In the penning of &s;uch a Statute as is here propo&s;ed, Regard &s;hould be had to the Deter|minations of Courts, particularly of the King's Bench on Appeals from Se&s;&s;ions upon particu|lar Points, and tho&s;e Clau&s;es that have been en|forced by any &s;uch Determinations, &s;hould be carefully pre&s;erved; as on the contrary, tho&s;e that have been condemned or adjudged nugatory &s;hould be amended or totally rejected.</P>
<P>It has been urged as a general Argument a|gain&s;t an Alteration of the Highway-Laws, with Regard to the Proportion of the Statute-Labour, that the &s;eeming Inequality of the Law is at la&s;t
<PB N="54" REF="62">
&s;et right by the Advantages accruing to the Poor from the Cheapne&s;s and Plenty which re&s;ult from good Roads, and a &s;peedy Conveyance of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life: But are the&s;e Advanta|ges peculiar to the Poor? do not the Rich par|take of them? nay, have they not by much the greate&s;t Share? A poor Labourer, who earns 9<HI>s.</HI> a Week pays yearly a two-and-fiftieth Part of his Year's Income for the&s;e Advantages, whatever they are; does a rich Man pay after that Rate? Is there any Gentleman of a Thou|&s;and Pounds a Year in the Kingdom, though he keeps a Coach, and wears the Roads more in a Week, than &s;uch a Man can po&s;&s;ibly do in ten Years, who pays Nineteen Pounds a Year to the Highways?</P>
<P>There are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;ome Preju|dices of a different Nature again&s;t the inferior Cla&s;s of People in this Kingdom, which &s;eem to &s;tand in the Way of any Regulations of this Sort in their Behalf; namely, their extreme Licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s beyond what is &s;een in other Countries, their Contempt of Religion and the Laws, their Want of Re&s;pect for their Superiors, their Idle|ne&s;s, Profanene&s;s, Intemperance, and a Num|ber of other Vices.</P>
<P>Before we proceed to refute the Arguments commonly deduced from the&s;e Premi&s;&s;es, let us enquire whether the Fact has any Foundation
<PB N="55" REF="63">
or not. It is certain, that the lower Sort of People among&s;t us are neither &s;o di&s;&s;olute nor ungovernable as they have been in Times which we have been taught to look on with more Reverence than perhaps is due to them. Tu|mults and In&s;urrections are much le&s;s frequent than they were formerly; and tho&s;e who mag|nify the Vices of the common People, and repre|&s;ent them as le&s;s obedient to Government than heretofore, forget that they have within the&s;e very few Years &s;een Thou&s;ands of the&s;e People ac|tuated by &s;ome one common Principle, what|ever it has been, for&s;aking their Relations and Friends, expo&s;ing their Lives in Defence of their Country, and extending the Reputation of its Courage and Humanity beyond that of any Na|tion in the World.</P>
<P>As to their Intemperance, it has never been &s;o great as to be beyond the Power of Laws to reduce it within tolerable Limits: tho&s;e lately made to re&s;train the U&s;e of &s;pirituous Liquors are In&s;tances how much it is in the Power of a Legi&s;lature to effect.</P>
<P>But admitting the Ju&s;tice of the above Charge, and that the lower Sort of People are ever &s;o di&s;&s;olute, &s;hall we therefore deny them Ju&s;tice? for that as far as it concerns them, is all that is now contended for; &s;hall we refu&s;e to di&s;charge them from a greater Load of public Duty,
<PB N="56" REF="64">
than they are able to bear, at the &s;ame Time that we are, with a Zeal unequalled in any pre|ceding Age, and with a Charity as &s;incere as it is wild and injudicious, anticipating their Wants, &s;etting their &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ocial Affections at Va|riance, and even laying in their Way Tempta|tions to Idlene&s;s, and tho&s;e other Vices of which we accu&s;e them?</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is, that Subjects of this Nature, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are Part of the grand Science of Politics, the very fir&s;t Prin|ciples whereof very few are able to conceive, and which &s;till fewer are able to rea&s;on about, who can pretend to &s;ay how much the Immorality of any People exceeds that Degree of it which &s;eems to be interwoven in the Con&s;titution of the moral World? All that concerns us as Men, is to di&s;courage it as much as po&s;&s;ible, for which Purpo&s;e it has ever been the Practice of wi&s;e Legi&s;lators to con&s;ider human Nature as it really is, rather than as what they would wi&s;h it to be, to encourage Virtue, and keep down Immora|lity by proper Sanctions, and &s;o to temper the various and conflicting Appetites and Humours of Mankind, as to produce good upon the whole.</P>
<P>There are various Cau&s;es which contribute to produce that Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of which we &s;o much complain; one of the mo&s;t prevailing &s;eems to be the little Attention that Men at this Day are
<PB N="57" REF="65">
di&s;po&s;ed to pay to Virtue as it re&s;ults from Prin|ciple; our very Modes of Expre&s;&s;ion imply our Di&s;regard of it; we no longer &s;ay of a Man, that he is a Man of Integrity, or Probity, or that he is beneficent or charitable, but that he has a <HI>good Heart,</HI> is a <HI>good Sort</HI> of Man, or a <HI>good Creature;</HI> for which cant Phra&s;es we are in|debted to the fertile Invention of a decea&s;ed Wit, who&s;e Writings, paltry and flim&s;y as they are, it is to be feared, may do more Mi&s;chief to Society than tho&s;e of <HI>Hobbes</HI> or <HI>Spinoza.</HI> The inevitable Con&s;equence of that loo&s;e Sy&s;tem of Morality by which the real or &s;uppo&s;ed Good|ne&s;s of a Man's Intention, and not the Dictates of tho&s;e who have a Right to govern, is made the Rule of his Conduct, is the Contempt of all po&s;itive In&s;titutions, of Law, of Religion it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Law, con&s;idered as a Rule of Action, and as calculated to extend and improve the Ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial Life, is, next to Religion, an Object the mo&s;t venerable; but &s;uch is the Temper of Mankind, that they look on it with Abhorrence, and form Confederacies to defeat its Purpo&s;es: nece&s;&s;ary Penalties to enforce the mo&s;t beneficial Statutes are con&s;idered as Infrac|tions of private Liberty, and it is much le&s;s criminal in the Eye of the Public to offend a|gain&s;t &s;uch a Law, than it is to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing the Offender to Ju&s;tice; the Man who in&s;tead
<PB N="58" REF="66">
of driving, rides in his Cart, in Contempt of the Law, and at the Ri&s;que of the Lives of his Fel|low &s;ubjects, is far le&s;s odious to the Populace than he who &s;hall inform again&s;t him; and thus it may be &s;aid that the Laws and the People are in a State of perpetual Ho&s;tility.</P>
<P>The State of Magi&s;tracy is therefore <Q REND="inline">"a pain|ful Pre-eminence,"</Q> in which a Man becomes odious by doing Good; and he who&s;e public Spirit would induce him to take upon him&s;elf the trouble of procuring Obedience to the Laws of his Country, mu&s;t relinqui&s;h the Endeavour if he has not al&s;o Fortitude enough to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ecret Malevolence of tho&s;e who have formed an erroneous Judgment of the Extent of civil Li|berty, and the clamourous Invectives of others who con&s;ider the &s;landering and traducing the Characters of all in Authority, as the Birth|right of an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI></P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on we &s;ee &s;o many Per&s;ons who&s;e Knowledge and Abilities enable them to promote the Quiet, Safety, and Happine&s;s of Mankind as Magi&s;trates, decline that Service, and a Tru&s;t of the greate&s;t Importance to the Lives and Liberties of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects executed in &s;ome In&s;tances by Mercenaries; but it is &s;ure|ly to be wi&s;hed, that in&s;tead of indulging a &s;elfi&s;h Indolence and Timidity, they would exert them&s;elves in the common Cau&s;e, and endeavour
<PB N="59" REF="67">
to avoid the Obloquy, which &s;o generally attends the producing remote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nd general good, by in|flicting the immediate and particular Evil of Pu|ni&s;hment, not by eluding the Duty, but by &s;hewing that they di&s;charge it upon Principles of true Benevolence, and that while they di&s;|tingui&s;h them&s;elves in their public Capacity, by their Diligence and Activity to mark and to puni&s;h Offences, they would al&s;o recommend them&s;elves in private Life, by the Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e milder Virtues, which give Lu&s;tre to the mo&s;t exalted Station.</P>
<P>The Service of the Public is indeed declined in &s;ome In&s;tances, which admit of no Apology. Can it be thought that our early Forefathers ever imagined that a Time would come when nearly all the Freeholders of a whole County &s;hould &s;ubmit to an annual Contribution, levied by the meane&s;t of its Servants, the legal Retinue of a Sheriff, to avoid &s;erving on Juries? or that the Legi&s;lature would ever find it nece&s;&s;ary to hire Men of E&s;tates to do that Duty which every Friend to Liberty &s;hould rejoice at being called to?</P>
<P>In&s;tances of public &s;pirit, however, are not wanting among us. What Difficulties, what Di&s;couragements, have tho&s;e Gentlemen &s;ur|mounted, who, from the noble&s;t Motives have laboured in the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a national Mi|litia,
<PB N="60" REF="68">
a Mea&s;ure to which, next to the Pro|vidence of God, this Country may be &s;aid to owe its Salvation!</P>
<P>But whatever are the Faults of the Times, it certainly behoves every Government to provide that the Laws are at lea&s;t free from Oppre&s;&s;ion or Inequality: tho&s;e which are here examined are manife&s;tly not &s;o; and whoever has Weight and Intere&s;t enough to procure &s;uch Alterations and Amendments of them, as upon a careful Review may be found to be nece&s;&s;ary, will by exerting his Endeavours for that End, perform for his Country a mo&s;t acceptable Service, and endear his Memory to late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
