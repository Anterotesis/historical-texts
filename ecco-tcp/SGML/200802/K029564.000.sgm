<P>NOT knowing, whether or no, the following Account of the Appearance may be of any u&s;e to you; I thought fit to &s;end it, that you may u&s;e it, or not, as you think fit. After the Appearance was over, there appeared a duski&s;h red Streak whence they &s;aid the Appearance came; it did not &s;eem to change its Place at all, but gradually vani&s;h'd away in about a quarter, or half an Hour; if the &s;ame was al&s;o ob&s;erv'd at other Places, the Heighth and Di&s;tance of it might ea&s;ily be calcula|ted.

But when I look'd at the Appearance it &s;elf thro' the Window, it was got further South-Ea&s;tward, and could not

<P>ON <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Night I &s;aw the &s;haking Meteor you make mention of. I was abroad in the Yard, before our Commi&s;&s;ioner's Door, and ob&s;erv'd both the Beginning, and almo&s;t the whole Continuance of it: which I take to be thus:</P>
<P>At 4 Minutes pa&s;t 8 a Clock, due We&s;t from the Place I &s;tood, about 40 Degrees high, fir&s;t appear'd a round reddi&s;h Ball (as near as I could gue&s;s) 8 or 10&prime; Diameter, which de&s;cended &s;lowly down|wards, a little inclining to the South, and all the while encrea&s;ing its Magnitude; when it came with|in 20 Deg. of the Horizon, it alter'd its Motion more a&s;lant to the Southward, and increas'd its Brightne&s;s and Magnitude prodigiou&s;ly, till its lea&s;t Diameter was about 26 to 28 Minutes; its Light and Brightne&s;s being equal to the Sun, but of a whiter Colour. (I take the Redne&s;s you mention to proceed from the &s;moaky Air you live in.) The Air was clear, except two thin Clouds through which it pa&s;s'd, as if the Clouds had been heated or &s;et on Fire in that Part, and which continu'd near half an Hour. Your Letter, and &s;ome other Accounts I have &s;een, &s;ay it continued half a Minute, but in|deed I gue&s;t by the Slowne&s;s of the Motion it was near a Minute before it di&s;appear'd; and when it came within 7 or 8 Deg. of the Horizon my Sight was ob&s;tructed at a Tar-hou&s;e that intercepted. Ma|ny People affirm they heard a Noi&s;e &s;ometime af|ter it like to Thunder, or a hot Iron quench'd in Water: and I thought I heard &s;uch a Noi&s;e faintly,

<P>LAST Night, a few Minutes before eight a Clock, we had here the terrible&s;t Fla&s;h of Lighten|ing that I believe was ever &s;een; it la&s;ted about three Minutes, as near as I can gue&s;s. It was &s;o great that it quite ob&s;cur'd the Light of the Moon, tho' it was a very bright Night. There appear'd in the Sky a Stream as it were of Fire for &s;ome Minutes after, and at &s;ome Di&s;tance as it were a Cloud of Smoke. The Phaenomenon was &s;o very &s;ur|prizing, that I did not at fir&s;t well know what to make of it, till after gazing at it about three or four Minutes, we heard a great Clap of Thunder, which at fir&s;t re&s;embled the Noi&s;e of Canon, the mo&s;t I e|ver heard in my Life.</P>

<P>SITTING at the Fire-&s;ide about Eight a Clock at Night, the <HI>Moon</HI> &s;hining then very bright, and the Sky clear, not the lea&s;t Cloud to be &s;een, on the &s;udden there appeared a very great Light far brighter than the Sun at Noon-day, ac|companied with &s;o great an Heat, that the Arm of mine which was next to the Window burnt for ma|ny Hours as if it had been &s;calded. There was &s;o great a Smoak, that I thought, and &s;o did ma|ny others, that all the Ground had been on Fire; but we &s;oon perceived that it was in the Sky. The Light came from the North-Ea&s;t (which is the Si|tuation of our Room) it &s;eem'd to go very &s;wift over our Hou&s;e, and &s;o over the Church to the South-We&s;t. In a very &s;hort time it returned back again (but not near &s;o big) and as it appeared to us, broke ju&s;t over the Church, like a Sky-Rocket, but &s;o large, and with &s;o many Sparks of Fire, that it left &s;o great a Redne&s;s (&s;eemingly to us ju&s;t the breadth and length of the Church) that it look|ed like all Blood, and gave the &s;ame Reflexion into the Rooms on the other &s;ide of the Hou&s;e. Some Minutes after this (I &s;hould think at lea&s;t &s;even or eight) we heard a Report like a great Canon (much greater than ever I heard.) It &s;hook the Hou&s;e and Windows very much. About a
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Minute after, there went off to our thinking, a|bout thirty, not &s;o big. They &s;ounded ju&s;t as the Tower-Guns did, when we were in <HI>Mincing|lane,</HI> but &s;hook the Hou&s;e and Windows much more. After this, we heard &s;maller, with a Sound like Drums and Trumpets, which la&s;ted but a &s;hort Time. After the Light went off, although the Moon &s;eemed to &s;hine bright; for about two Mi|nutes, it was &s;o dark, that we could not &s;ee our Hands.</P>

<P>&mdash;I Should not trouble you any longer, but that we had a very extraordinary Meteor la&s;t <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Night, the Nineteenth of this In|&s;tant. I was walking in <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Green, and &s;aw it di&s;tinctly, about 20 after Seven, the Moon was pretty bright, when on a &s;udden, it was in a Manner extingui&s;h'd by a prodigious Blaze, two or three Times bigger than its Orb, of very white clear Light. It began about <HI>E.S.E.</HI> moved for|ward to the <HI>S.</HI> for about 20 Degrees extreamly &s;wift, and then ended in a Point. It &s;hot like a Cone, left a Train of reddi&s;h Light, which &s;oon vani&s;h'd, for all was over in eight or nine Se|conds. The Appearances of Meteors are &s;o &s;udden, and their Continuance &s;o &s;hort, that they are &s;el|dom ob&s;erv'd, and hard to be de&s;crib'd. It was &s;een at <HI>Drogheda,</HI> but I have heard no Account of it further off.</P>

<P>COming Home this Evening, about 8 a Clock, thro' St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-Yard, on the North &s;ide, my Face being We&s;tward, I di&s;cern'd in the Sky a large Ball of Fire, at about 20 or 25&deg; height from the Horizon, and bearing about <HI>W.</HI> and by <HI>N.</HI> or <HI>W.N.W.</HI> when I fir&s;t &s;aw it: It &s;eem'd to be as large as the Moon at Full, with a pale blewi&s;h Light, and to have little Motion; but in a Moment it was thrown into the Shape of a common Meteor, the Head di|mini&s;hing 'till it was all turn'd into a long Stream of Light, which extended to about 50 or 60&deg; in the Heavens toward <HI>S.W.</HI> and on an Angle of about 10 or 15&deg; from a Parallel with the Horizon, but the broade&s;t part of this Stream was at lea&s;t double to the Diameter of its fir&s;t Appearance, and made &s;o &s;trong a Light while it was in its greate&s;t Extent, that for a Moment the Moon, which was above a Day pa&s;t the fir&s;t Quarter, and all the Stars, &s;eem'd to di&s;appear by the Superiority of this new Light; and at that Moment one might have read the &s;malle&s;t Print by it. While it was throwing it &s;elf into this beautiful Stream, I thought I heard a Noi&s;e of hi&s;&s;ing, like what is made by the flying of a large Rocket in the Air, but I heard no other Noi&s;e. The Light, tho' very &s;trong, was very a|greeable to the Eye, and as it vani&s;h'd it turn'd from a bright Pale to a Yellowi&s;h Colour. The Du|ration of the whole I do not think was above half a Minute, and of the greate&s;t Light not the tenth part of a Minute.</P>

It was a Minute or more before they were quite extin|gui&s;hed; the Light was &s;o great as to extingui&s;h that of the Moon; the Colour was very White and Blue, like the common Compo&s;ition of Stars in Rockets; and &s;everal Per&s;ons, both Abroad and in the Hou&s;e, were po&s;itive of hearing di&s;tinctly a Noi&s;e, like a great Number of Rockets going off together.</P>

I open'd in&s;tantly the Window, from whence I had a clear Pro&s;pect of that Part of Heaven, except a|bout three or four Degrees next to the Horizon. The whole Space A B, was fill'd up in an In&s;tant, with a very bright Flame, which might la&s;t about four Seconds of Time, and perhaps not above two or three Seconds, and &s;o did &s;uddenly vani&s;h, lea|ving in the very &s;ame Place A B, a &s;mall thin Cloud, of a grey Colour, &s;omewhat reddi&s;h. At the &s;ame Time, a &s;mall Fire continu'd from B, to run lei&s;urely along the Line B E C, leaving all a|long behind it a grey Stream, about 15&prime; broad. The Line B E C, was very uniform, a little bend|ing towards <HI>Sirius;</HI> but the Edges or Sides of it were rough, and not uniform as the Line it &s;elf, this Part being in &s;ome Places a very little broader or narrower than in others. The whole Figure A B E C re&s;embled exactly a Rod or Staff. The Fire might be about five Seconds in de&s;cribing the Line B E C, having its handle about 1d broad in A B, in a di|rect continued Line with the re&s;t. While the Line B C was a forming, it look'd exactly as if a Roc|ket, or a Bomb, had been thrown in our Neigh|bourhood. The vi&s;ible Remains of this whole Phe|nomenon
<PB N="14" REF="14">
continuing about a Quarter of an Hour, gave me an Opportunity of delineating it immedi|ately, with the Stars about it. But becau&s;e of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of making a plain Figure, repre&s;ent|ing truly &s;o great a Part of Heaven, unle&s;s it be in the Nature of a Projection, I have reduc'd here my Figures to a Plani&s;phere, whereof the <HI>Zenith</HI> is the Center, the Eye being &s;uppos'd in the op|po&s;ite Point, in the Surface of the Sphere. How|ever, I have placed the Stars only by E&s;timation, as my Figures directed me, without u&s;ing any Ta|ble of the Stars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In my Draught, I &s;uppos'd for a Foundation, that the higher-mo&s;t Star in <HI>O|rion,</HI> was about 30d high, as I judg'd it to be by E&s;timation.

<P>NOW the proper Re&s;ult of all the&s;e Accounts, and of many others that I have &s;een and heard, is this; That this Meteor was compos'd of Nitro-&s;ulphureous Vapours, or Exhalations, collected fir&s;t together in the upper Regions of the Air, over <HI>Radnor&s;hire</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> or the neighbouring Counties: That it was at fir&s;t &s;maller, and to Appearance like a large Star only; that it gathered more Fewel as it rolled along, and grew larger and larger all the Way; that its Cour&s;e was nearly Parallel to the Horizon, and its Direction nearly South, or a very &s;mall matter towards the South-We&s;t: That by the time it came to be Vertical, between <HI>Cardiff</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> and, and <HI>Minehead</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> over the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, it was become va&s;tly large and bright, &s;o as to exceed the Noon-day Sun in Splendor, near that Line along which it pa&s;s'd, and

to equal its apparent Magnitude al&s;o: That it pro|ceeded in this manner quite over <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> but much nearer the Ea&s;tern Limits of it, than the We&s;tern: That it pa&s;t almo&s;t perpendicularly over the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and &s;o over the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Channel, till it came over <HI>Bretaign</HI> in <HI>France:</HI> That all this while its Mag|nitude and Light were not impair'd; that it made a hi&s;&s;ing Noi&s;e like a Rocket all the way, and &s;pread a prodigious and continued Lightening, even to the utmo&s;t Limits of the whole Horizon: That upon its coming near to <HI>Bretaign</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> it began to bur&s;t to Pieces and di&s;&s;olve, with a prodigious Noi&s;e, which endur'd for &s;ome time, an&s;wering to the time of its bur&s;ting to Pieces, all the while it was di&s;&s;olving: That it left a large Smoke, or &s;ort of Cloud along all that Space where it bur&s;t, above 100 Miles in Length, over our Channel and <HI>Bretaign,</HI> and perhaps &s;omewhat further towards <HI>Bell-I&s;le:</HI> That the Noi&s;e of this Explo|&s;ionw as heard all along its Cour&s;e, and 50 or 60 Miles at lea&s;t on both Sides of it; fir&s;t like a va&s;t Number of great Guns di&s;charg'd together; and then like the rattling or interrupted Noi&s;e of Drums; &s;uch as are in both Ca&s;es u&s;ual in and after great Claps of Thunder: That this Meteor, while it was di&s;&s;olving, &s;eems to have &s;ent out le&s;&s;er Streams of Light, backwards to|wards <HI>Wales</HI> from the North-end; and backwards to|wards <HI>Exeter,</HI> from the South-end, before it intirely va|ni&s;hed: After which, certain Traces or Streams of the fiery Vapors continued &s;or a quarter of an Hour, as Marks where it had pa&s;&s;ed: That this Meteor mu&s;t have been about 38 or 40 Miles in perpendicular Height from the Earth all along, tho' perhaps &s;omewhat lower towards its di&s;&s;olution: That it went from <HI>Radnor</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> to the utmo&s;t Parts of <HI>Bretaign</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> or about 300 Miles, in 7 or 8&Prime; of Time; or at the Rate of above 2000 Miles in a Minute: That it mu&s;t have been vi&s;ible, wherever Clouds did not in|terpo&s;e, within the Compa&s;s of an Oval, who&s;e lon|ger Axis, drawn nearly through <HI>Radnor</HI> and <HI>Bell-I&s;le,</HI> mu&s;t have been about 1400 Miles, and its le&s;&s;er at right Angles thereto about 1100 Miles, <HI>i. e.</HI> through

(2.) The &s;econd Meteor of this kind, that I have met with was, in the Words of the &s;ame Dr. <HI>Hook</HI> <Q REND="inline"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 199.</NOTE>A <HI>Fax,</HI> or <HI>Lam|pas volans,</HI> ob&s;erv'd after Sun-&s;et, the 1 &s;t of <HI>March</HI> 1676, at <HI>Fau</HI>&mdash;by <HI>Petrus de Lavina;</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Auzout;</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> by <HI>Matthias del Arpi;</HI> at <HI>Venice,</HI> by <HI>Jo.

It &s;eemed to ri&s;e out of the North-Ea&s;t, and to pa&s;s by the Me|ridian to the South-We&s;t Parts of the Heavens, near the &s;ame Tract that the Sun had gone that Day; and di&s;appear'd behind thick Clouds, where, with a mighty Noi&s;e, it was &s;uppos'd to be blown to pieces and di&s;pers'd. It appeared about the Bigne&s;s of the Full Moon, and left behind it a Tail about three Diameters, of a reddi&s;h Flame at fir&s;t, but turning blewi&s;h towards the la&s;t. It la&s;ted about a Mi|nute or two. Its Noi&s;e at la&s;t was like the Noi&s;e of an Earthquake at a Di&s;tance, and made the Gla&s;s in the Windows &s;hake. From the comparing &s;everal Ob&s;er|vations 'twas &s;uppos'd about 90 Miles high, and near a Mile in Diameter.</Q></P>
<P>N.B. <HI>This mu&s;t, in all Probability, be the very &s;ame Meteor which</HI> Montanari, <HI>the great Mathematician at</HI> Bononia <HI>&s;aw, and exactly mea&s;ur'd; of which pre|&s;ently.

either in their <HI>Bigne&s;s,</HI> which is u&s;ually about or under a Mile in Diameter; while Comets are u&s;ually of the Bigne&s;s of Planets, or &s;everal thou&s;and Miles in Dia|meter: or in their <HI>Nature,</HI> which is that of Light or Fire; while Comets are ever as dark or opake in them|&s;elves as the Planets; or in their <HI>Trajectory,</HI> which in Comets is a Line de&s;cending to, and a&s;cending from the Sun, and nearly parabolical; while the&s;e Meteors &s;till pa&s;s in a manner parallel to the Earth's Horizon: or in their <HI>Velocity,</HI> which in the&s;e Meteors is very diffe|rent, but in Comets near the Earth is always the &s;ame; or in their <HI>Atmo&s;pheres,</HI> of which the&s;e Meteors are &s;till de&s;titute; but which almo&s;t always encompa&s;s the Bo|dies of Comets, and that to a va&s;t Di&s;tance; or in their <HI>Tails,</HI> of which we have no Signs in the&s;e Me|teors, but which almo&s;t as certainly accompany the Comets as do their Atmo&s;pheres them&s;elves, as in|deed derived from them: or in their <HI>vi&s;ible Duration,</HI> which in the&s;e Meteors is &s;eldom many Minutes, fre|quently not many Seconds, but in Comets is u&s;ually many Days or Weeks, nay &s;ometimes Months.

<PB N="24" REF="24">
this Appearance, and think it one of the harde&s;t things to account for that I have yet met with in the Phaenomena of Meteors; and am in|duced to think that it mu&s;t be &s;ome Collection of Matter form'd in the Aether, <HI>as it were by &s;ome fortui|tous Concour&s;e of Atoms;</HI> and that the Earth met with it as it pa&s;t along in its Orb, then but newly form'd, and before it had conceiv'd any great <HI>Impetus</HI> of De&s;cent toward the Sun. For the direction of that over <HI>Italy</HI> was exactly oppo&s;ite to that of the Earth, that is, its Cour&s;e was from <HI>W.S.W.</HI> to <HI>E.N.E.</HI> where|fore the Meteor &s;eem'd to move the contrary way; and be&s;ides, falling into the Power of the Earth's Gravity, and lo&s;ing its Motion from the Oppo&s;ition to the Medium, it &s;eems that it de&s;cended towards the Earth, and was extingui&s;h'd in the <HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Sea, to the We&s;t South We&s;t of <HI>Leghorn.</HI> The great Blow being heard upon its fir&s;t Immer&s;ion into the Water, and the rattling like the driving a Cart over Stones, being what &s;ucceeded upon its quenching; &s;ome|thing like which is always ob&s;erv'd upon quenching a very hot Iron in Water.</Q> Thus far Dr. <HI>Halley.</HI></P>

Such a Ma&s;s of Matter in an immen&s;e Vacuum, without any Gravitation to the Sun, the Dr. well knows is a mere Chimaera, contra|dicting all the certain Philo&s;ophy in the World. Nor can it be po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppos'd but by immediate Creati|on out of nothing, or by it &s;elf emerging out of no|thing, without being created, before it could be thus <HI>collected together;</HI> neither of which Notions, I imagine, will be ju&s;tify'd by the Dr. him&s;elf, in his cool Thoughts. But let us for once &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch Ma&s;&s;es of fiery Matter frequently collected in the Aether, tho' we know they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o collected; yet is it evident,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="25">
(2.) That if &s;uch Meteors as the&s;e were thence de|riv'd, they would appear at all &s;orts of Di&s;tances, within the reach of their Light, or within the reach of a thou&s;and or two of Miles: For a Body &s;o large, and a Light &s;o nearly equal to that of the Sun, as the&s;e have, would certainly be vi&s;ible &s;o far; where|as it does not appear, that any of them have been yet &s;een &s;o far as 50 Miles from the Earth.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The&s;e Meteors would, on &s;uch an Hypothe&s;is, be equally of all Magnitudes what&s;oever; &s;uch fortu|itous Productions, if &s;uch there were, going for cer|tain by no Rule at all: Whereas tho&s;e above-mention|ed &s;eem never to have been of a larger Size than this la&s;t, which was about a Mile in Diameter; and the re&s;t of no very great Variety therefrom.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) They would and mu&s;t all, upon this Hypo|the&s;is, as the Dr. allows, in the&s;e Climates, go nearly with the &s;ame Velocity, and in the &s;ame Cour&s;e, as to our Sight, <HI>i. e.</HI> from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; becau&s;e their Motion being only apparent, mu&s;t be deriv'd from the Earth's Motions, Annual and Diurnal, which are from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, both the &s;ame way, and of one tenor. Whereas the&s;e Meteors go uncertainly, and without any regard to tho&s;e Motions at all. Accordingly, this la&s;t went almo&s;t directly South, and much fa&s;ter than even the annual Motion it &s;elf; entirely contrary to this Hy|pothe&s;is.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) If the&s;e Balls of Light or Fire were &s;uch Ma&s;|&s;es as did not belong to our Atmo&s;phere, but only pa&s;s'd through it accidentally, as Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> &s;uppo&s;es; why do we not &s;ee them before our Atmo&s;phere reaches them? and after it leaves them, whenever it does &s;o, as well as while they pa&s;s through it? not to &s;ay, that the fir&s;t Collection, as well as la&s;t Di&s;&s;oluti|on of the&s;e Meteors, does, by the Ob&s;ervations them|&s;elves appear, both to begin and end within the Li|mits of that Atmo&s;phere, and thereby &s;hew they pro|perly belong to it, entirely contrary to the Dr's. Hy|pothe&s;is.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) If this was the Origin of the&s;e Meteors, why do they &s;eldom or never hit again&s;t the Body of the
<PB N="26" REF="26">
Earth it &s;elf, or terraqueous Globe, but again&s;t the Air? Or rather, why does the Body of the Earth or terraqueous Globe, &s;eldom or never hit again&s;t the&s;e Me|teors, but only the Air, nay the upper Regions of the Air? Why do the&s;e Meteors &s;eldom or never de&s;troy a City, or burn up a Fleet, as well as pa&s;s over our Heads, without doing us any Damage? The Earth's Diameter is near 8000 Miles; the Altitude of any &s;en|&s;ible Atmo&s;phere, as Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> has fully prov'd, is not 50 Miles, and thence the Diameter of the whole, not 8100 Miles. Now the Disk or bigge&s;t Circle of the larger Sphere will be to the Disk or bigge&s;t Circle of the &s;maller here, as the Squares of tho&s;e Numbers, or nearly as 40 to 41, and the Difference of tho&s;e Squares, or the Hazard of &s;uch a Ball's hitting again&s;t the Earth, or the Atmo&s;phere, will be as the &s;maller Number to the Difference of tho&s;e Numbers, or as 40 to 1. Nay, &s;ince only the upper Regions of the Air, for in them alone the&s;e Meteors have been &s;een, are to be compar'd with the Earth; it will appear on a like Calculation, that the Hazard of &s;uch a Ball's hitting again&s;t the Earth, is to that of its hitting a|gain&s;t the upper Parts of the Atmo&s;phere, at lea&s;t as 100 to 1, or that, one with another, 100 of the&s;e ter|rible Meteors will hit again&s;t the Earth it &s;elf, and de|&s;troy all before them, for one that hits again&s;t the upper Regions of the Air; and above 100 will hit a|gain&s;t either the Earth, or lower Regions of the Air, for one that hits again&s;t tho&s;e upper Regions; to which yet we &s;ee Providence u&s;ually, if not always confines them. I &s;ay that the&s;e Meteors &s;eem &s;eldom or never to hit again&s;t the terraqueous Globe it &s;elf.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> imagines, that tho&s;e which go off with a Report, as the principal certainly, and all probably do, mu&s;t fall into the Sea, and in quenching make that Noi&s;e we hear after the&s;e Mete|ors, and that one of tho&s;e already mentioned de&s;cen|ded towards the Earth, and was extingui&s;hed particu|larly in the <HI>Tyrrhene Sea.</HI> But then, &s;ince that is a bare Hypothe&s;is, and without any Fact or Hi&s;tory to &s;up|port it, nay contrary to the known Ob&s;ervations them|&s;elves,

while Dr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s Account, &s;et down as above, a&s;&s;ures us, that the <HI>Italian Meteor</HI> which Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> &s;up|pos'd to fall into the Sea, only &s;et behind a Cloud, I &s;hall not need to confute it any farther.

<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="section">
<P N="5">V. I &s;hall now propo&s;e a New Hypothe&s;is of my own, for the Solution of the&s;e Appearances, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are no other than prodigious Storms, or Bla&s;ts of Thunder and Lightening in the upper Regions of our Air: With my Rea&s;ons for that Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>Having therefore now given my Rea&s;ons, why I cannot at all go into the Notions of either Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> or Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> in this Matter; I come to my own Hypo|the&s;is, or Conjecture; &s;o I &s;hall yet call it: Tho' I confe&s;s the Evidence for it &s;eems to me &s;o &s;trong, that, if the future Phaenomena of this kind do confirm it, as much as I think tho&s;e do which we are hitherto acquainted withal, it may perhaps hereafter merit a higher Denomination.</P>
<P>My Opinion therefore concerning &s;uch Meteors, is plainly this, That they properly de&s;erve that Name of <HI>Meteors,</HI> as belonging directly to our Atmo&s;phere; and that they are no other than prodigious Storms or bla&s;ts of Thunder and Lightening, of &s;uch Thunder and Lightening, as is proper and peculiar to tho&s;e more elevated Regions of our Air in which they ap|pear. In order to the true under&s;tanding of my meaning in which Hypothe&s;is, the Reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Air at 39 Miles high, is, by Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Cal|culation,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
agreed to now by all, about 2000 times ra|rer and weaker than it is here with us; that a Storm or Bla&s;t of this kind, even here below, &s;eems to be a Collection of nitro-&s;ulphureous and fiery Vapors, into a &s;ort of a rolling Globe, or Whirl-wind of Fire; that this is that <HI>Fulmen</HI> or <HI>pernicious Lightning,</HI> which is &s;o terrible in its Effects; that it is &s;till accompanied with that <HI>Fulgur</HI> or <HI>Fla&s;h,</HI> we call <HI>common Lightening,</HI> and with that <HI>Tonitru,</HI> that great rolling or rattling Noi&s;e which we call <HI>Thunder;</HI> and that &s;uch Collecti|ons of nitro-&s;ulphureous or fiery Vapors may be va&s;tly larger before they are limited or determined by the external Air, which by rarefaction is excluded from within, where it is &s;o va&s;tly rare, than the like Col|lections are with us: That the prodigious Velocity of &s;uch Balls may al&s;o be better &s;uppos'd in &s;uch a rare and thin Medium, than in ours, &s;o much den&s;er and thicker; and that &s;o much the greater Quantity of nitro-&s;ulphureous Vapors will be &s;pent and exhau&s;ted by one &s;uch Ball or Bla&s;t, than by one of ours here below, as it is in Magnitude greater; which will al&s;o render &s;uch Phaenomena in the &s;ame Proportion rarer and &s;eldomer in any certain region there than here.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being &s;uppo&s;ed, which appear to me very rea&s;onable; it will be a natural Account of the&s;e Phaenomenona, if we e&s;teem them direct Bla&s;ts of this kind. For certainly the&s;e Fire-balls, as we have &s;hew'd, are &s;till within the Limits of our Air, the Place of &s;uch Meteors: They have all the three Chara|cters of &s;uch, and only of &s;uch Bla&s;ts; the <HI>Fulmen,</HI> the Ball or Whirlwind of pernicious Lightening; the <HI>Fulgur,</HI> the Fla&s;h or common Lightening; and the <HI>To|nitra,</HI> the Noi&s;e or Thunder. They go with a Swiftne&s;s which we have no Examples of here in any Meteors, unle&s;s it be in &s;uch Thunder and Lightening. So that I do not &s;ee room for much doubt in the Ca&s;e. 'Tis true, the rarene&s;s of the Air above, will, as in all like Ca&s;es, greatly deaden and damp the &s;ound of the Thunder; as no doubt it does; but this is no great difficulty here, becau&s;e the prodigious Va&s;tne&s;s of the Bla&s;t, if it be at all &s;o much more violent as
<PB N="29" REF="29">
the Fire-ball is greater in Quantity, as it mu&s;t natu|rally be, will abundantly make up that Defect, and afford us a &s;ufficient Sound notwith&s;tanding; as will appear pre&s;ently by Calculation. I do not indeed know any mechanical Power, that in &s;uch a fluid Me|dium as the Air, can cau&s;e &s;o &s;udden, and &s;o prodigi|ous a Collection of fiery Vapors, and carry them in one particular horizontal Direction with &s;uch an im|men&s;e Velocity as we here meet with. But then, I am equally at a lo&s;s for the mechanical Cau&s;e of the &s;trange Effects of Gun-powder, and of the like Cau&s;e of the Velocity, Force, and Direction of Thunder and Lightening, and indeed of many other Powers of Nature; of who&s;e Exi&s;tence, yet, there is no man|ner of Que&s;tion. So that if it appear, that this Me|teor is no other than a Bla&s;t of Thunder and Ligh|tening, &s;uch as is proper and peculiar to the higher Regions of the Air, as I hope it now does; we ought not to object this Difficulty again&s;t the pre&s;ent Soluti|on, which is built on the known Properties of nitro|&s;ulphureous Vapors in all &s;uch Explo&s;ions, whether of Gun-powder below, or of Thunder and Lightening a little above.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>And now, for a Conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall Ob&s;erve a few things which may, on this Occa&s;ion, de&s;erve the At|tention of the Curious.</P>
<P N="1">Note (1.) That &s;uch a Collection of nitro&s;ulphureous Vapours as this, of a Mile in Diameter, is to &s;uch a Col|lection of the like Vapours in the large&s;t Thunder-Storms here below, of &s;carce 20 Feet Diameter, as the Cubes of tho&s;e Diameters, or as 16,000,000 to 1. So that the Explo&s;ion or Force of &s;uch a Ball of Fire as this would naturally, as to Light, Sound, and Strength, be in the &s;ame Proportion al&s;o. Whence it is que&s;tionable, whether if all the Gunpowder now in the World were laid together, and fir'd at once, it could make an Explo&s;ion equal to this before us.</P>
<P N="2">Note (2.) That therefore it is no Wonder that the Sound of this Explo&s;ion was heard at the Di&s;tance of at lea&s;t 80 or 100 Miles from the Explo&s;ion it &s;elf, even through that upper Air, where it is about 2000 times
<PB N="30" REF="30">
rarer, and therefore in the &s;ame Proportion weaker than it is here below.</P>
<P N="3">Note (3.) That therefore if this Ball of Fire had been directed downward, and come into our lower Air, and been there exploded, its Sound, at the &s;ame Di|&s;tances, would have been about 2000 times as great as it now was, So that be&s;ides the &s;ad De&s;olation that might ari&s;e from the Ball of Fire, which would have been va&s;tly &s;udden and terrible, the very Sound or Concu&s;&s;ion of the Air would it &s;elf have been exceed|ing dreadful, and very fatal al&s;o to all the neighbour|ing Animals, Trees, and Buildings what&s;oever. Some of the &s;maller <HI>Meteors</HI> of this kind afford no Sound at this Di&s;tance; but the larger &s;ort, of which the la&s;t was the Principal, did &s;o always to a great Degree, as the foregoing Hi&s;tories inform us.</P>
<P N="4">Note (4.) That therefore a &s;maller <HI>Meteor</HI> of this &s;ort, or &s;uch as &s;ome of the foregoing Hi&s;tories de|&s;cribe, if it &s;hould de&s;cend to the Earth, would be a|bundantly &s;ufficient utterly to de&s;troy a particular Ci|ty; and &s;uch an one as this, no &s;mall part of a County, and that in an in&s;tant, without giving the lea&s;t room for foreknowing, preventing, or e&s;caping from the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">Note (5.) That we know of no mechanical Cau&s;es that can prevent &s;uch a De&s;cent of the&s;e <HI>Meteors</HI> down|wards: For as our common Thunder and Lightening certainly do, and that not &s;eldom, de&s;cend from the Clouds to the Earth, and make le&s;&s;er De&s;tructions there, &s;o do &s;ome of the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations incline us to allow that even this, as well as others of the&s;e <HI>Me|teors,</HI> have a little de&s;cended in their Cour&s;e al&s;o. Nor in ca&s;e of the original Direction downwards, do I know any &s;ufficient Ob&s;tacle our lower Air, how den&s;e &s;oever, could lay in its way; the Strength and Velocity of &s;uch a <HI>Meteor,</HI> va&s;tly exceeding any &s;uch incon&s;ide|rable Re&s;i&s;tance. Yet it is to be noted,</P>
<P N="6">(6.) That our late Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e <HI>Meteors</HI> of this kind, who&s;e Heights have been mea&s;ur'd, never give le&s;s than 30 Miles Altitude to any of them. Whence it appears, that the Great and Good Author of Na|ture
<PB N="31" REF="31">
has generally, in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, confin'd them to the upper Regions of our Air, and pre&s;erv'd the lower Parts of it, with the Inhabitants of the Earth and Seas, from the di&s;mal Effects of them; tho' that Confinement and Pre&s;ervation be provided for by Cau&s;es which no way appear to us at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) That we accordingly have no certain Accounts of any great De&s;truction brought upon Mankind by &s;uch <HI>Meteors,</HI> excepting that amazing and divine Judg|ment on <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah, Admah</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI> which the Sacred Scriptures record, and to which all the Heathen Accounts al&s;o agree.

<P>Now how exactly the&s;e De&s;criptions agree to a Countrey de&s;troy'd by &s;uch a terrible <HI>Meteor</HI> as this, I dare appeal to all &s;ober and con&s;iderate Naturali&s;ts: while the <HI>Rain of Fire and Brim&s;tone,</HI> or of <HI>Brim&s;tone on Fire,</HI> with nitrous Salts intermixed, is here literally true: while the <HI>Smoak like the Smoak of a Furnace,</HI> is al|&s;o literally true: it being evident in Fact, that all Vulcano's, great Guns, and &s;uch <HI>Meteors</HI> as the&s;e, di|rectly leave a mighty Smoak after their Explo&s;ion: while the Salt Lake it&s;elf would ea&s;ily thence ari&s;e, by the Penetration of &s;uch fierce and fiery Particles into the Bowels of a Countrey, which was <HI>full of Slime-pits</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. xiv. 10.</NOTE> already, and &s;o prepared to take Fire: while it would thus ea&s;ily de&s;troy it&s;elf by a <HI>Subver&s;ion,</HI> an <HI>Overthrow,</HI> or an Earthquake, and thereupon admit the Waters of the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> from the neighbouring <HI>Sea of the Plain,</HI> and would infect them with its nitrous and &s;ulphureous Vapours, and &s;o become one great <HI>Salt,</HI> or <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> for all future Generati|ons: while the Remains of all this would naturally pro|duce &s;uch a barren Soil, full of Smoak and A&s;hes, as
<PB N="33" REF="33">
we find adjoyning to the Salt Sea, by the foregoing De&s;criptions.

<P N="8">Note (8.) That one great ordinary Intention and U&s;e of the&s;e Meteors &s;eems to be the &s;ame with that of the Tides for the Sea; and of Storms, whether of Wind, or of Thunder and Lightening, for the low|er Air; I mean not only the agitating the Air, but chiefly the purging and purifying of it, by &s;pending and con&s;uming &s;uch noxious Steams and Exhalations, as otherwi&s;e might be pernicious to Mankind, to the Bruit Animals, and to the other Inhabitants there|of, if &s;uch there be. I &s;ay, this &s;eems to me at lea&s;t <HI>one of the U&s;es</HI> of Thunder and Lightening, both here below, and there above; without pre&s;uming to deny that there may be other U&s;es of the &s;ame, or that the&s;e, as well as other Meteors, may be farther inten|ded by Providence for Purpo&s;es which we have at pre&s;ent no certain Means of di&s;covering.

<P N="9">Note (9.) That there &s;eem to have been of late more uncommon Meteors &s;een than have been u&s;ual
<PB N="34" REF="34">
in the like Space of Time. Thus we have had at lea&s;t Eight or Nine of the Meteors of this kind taken Notice of in the&s;e Parts of the World, within 53 Years; while we know not where to find &s;o many in a much longer Space in any elder Hi&s;tories. Thus al&s;o there have been more frequent and remarkable <HI>Aurorae Boreales,</HI> or <HI>Northern Lights,</HI> ob&s;erv'd within &s;omewhat more than three Years la&s;t pa&s;t, than appear in our Hi&s;torians, in a much longer Space.

Nor can it well be &s;aid, that all this has happened only by the Negligence of the elder Writers in tran&s;|mitting &s;uch Things to us: Since, on the contrary, they have generally been but over Super&s;titious in &s;etting down &s;uch &s;trange Appearances, and of no|ting how ominous they thought them to Mankind.</P>

They are indeed, with other cele&s;ti|al Phaenomena, naturally Invitations to the ab&s;tract|ing our Minds from continually poring on things be|low; they call on us to look upwards, to the Works of
<PB N="35" REF="35">
God that are above us; to his &s;uperior Providence, and to a proper Dependance on him. They preach to us this Doctrine, That God has it always in his Power to pre&s;erve or de&s;troy the World, and all the Crea|tures therein, as he plea&s;es; and this without any new Miracles. But they are, I think, of them&s;elves, and generally &s;peaking, no proper Indications of impen|ding Judgments, or of God's Will to puni&s;h or de&s;troy any Part of his Creatures. It may be indeed ju&s;tly e|&s;teem'd a great Sign of the Guilt and con&s;cious Wic|kedne&s;s of Mankind in general; that all &s;uch extraor|dinary Phaenomena are &s;till interpreted to the wor&s;e Sen&s;e, as Fore-runners of Wars, Famines, Plagues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but they are not, I believe, any Signs that God is really and particularly at &s;uch times bringing tho&s;e or the like Judgments upon them. However, I have &s;o fully &s;poken my Mind of this Matter, and of the Li|mitations and Re&s;trictions thereto belonging, in my Account of the former &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>Meteor, March</HI> 6. 1716. <HI>pag.</HI> 74-77. that I &s;hall not repeat it here, but refer the Reader thither, who de&s;ires farther Satisfa|ction. I conclude with one more important Ob&s;erva|tion, which is this:</P>
<P N="12">Note (12.) That we ought here to ob&s;erve, and to ac|knowledge the good Providence of God, the great Au|thor of univer&s;al Nature, of the Air in particular, with its &s;urpri&s;ing Wonders; and the great Di&s;po&s;er and Di|rector of them all, in u&s;ually confining the terrible <HI>Meteors</HI> of this kind to the upper Regions of the Air, and not permitting them to de&s;cend low enough to hurt us here below. And this de&s;erves more particu|larly our regard, becau&s;e we know of no mechanical Cau&s;es that can hinder their Direction downward; and becau&s;e we know that ordinary Thunder-bla&s;ts are frequently &s;o directed, and this &s;ometimes to the terrible De&s;truction of Buildings and Animals here below. Let us but con&s;ider, what has been above &s;hewn, how certainly &s;uch a de&s;cending Ball or Whirl|wind of Fire and Brim&s;tone as this, which was a full Mile in Diameter, and mov'd at the rate of at lea&s;t 2000 Miles in a Minute, might have conquer'd all the Re|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="36" REF="36">
of our lower Air; and in a moment, before it could have been in the lea&s;t fore&s;een, or provided a|gain&s;t by any, might have de&s;troy'd &s;uch a City as <HI>London</HI> it &s;elf. How inevitably, how immediately, &s;uch a famous Emporium might then have <HI>been as Sodom, and like unto Gomor|rah;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;.</HI> i. 9.</NOTE> and not one Per&s;on might have e&s;|caped to tell the &s;ad News to the re&s;t of the World? This would not &s;eldom be the natural Re&s;ult of &s;uch Bla&s;ts here below, which are frequently &s;een above, did not the divine Providence, by &s;ome Means un|known to us, re&s;train their Cour&s;e, and <HI>&s;ix them their Bounds which they can|not pa&s;s;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;.</HI> civ. 9.</NOTE> and &s;ay, <HI>hitherto &s;hall ye come, and no further;</HI> and in &s;uch a Place a|bove <HI>&s;hall your proud Waves,</HI> or <HI>Bla&s;ts be &s;tayed.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 11.</NOTE> This is the rational, the reli|gious Con&s;equence; this is the ju&s;t and the pious In+ference, which the Con&s;ideration of &s;uch &s;urprizing Meteors, &s;uch wonderful Works of <HI>him that dwelleth in the Heavens</HI> naturally &s;ugge&s;ts to us. I therefore end my Di&s;cour&s;e on this, nearly as I did that on the former Meteor; <HI>O ye Fire and Heat, O ye Lightenings and Clouds; O ye Children of Men, ble&s;s ye the Lord; prai&s;e and exalt him above all for ever.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Song of the three Children</HI> v. 43, 50, 56.</NOTE></P>

<P>_I Have ju&s;t now got &s;ome good Ob&s;ervations of this Meteor from our famous Ob&s;ervato|ry at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and what Accounts were there received, <HI>viz.</HI> that to us about <HI>London</HI> it aro&s;e from or but little under the Seven Stars, which were then half a Point from the We&s;t to the North, at the Altitude of 22&deg; or 23&deg;, that it proceeded above 40&deg; upon the Horizon, till it came under the Sword of <HI>Orion,</HI> near the South We&s;t, and about the Al|titude of 15&deg;; that the time of its Appearance was near|ly 11&prime; after 8, and that it la&s;ted about 6&Prime;, making a hi&s;|&s;ing Noi&s;e as it pa&s;&s;ed along. All which confirms what I have already advanc'd, and particularly implies what I have noted above, That the Meteor had the grea|te&s;t Elevation at fir&s;t, or was not much le&s;s than 50 Miles high, which is nearly the utmo&s;t Limit of our Atmo&s;phere; that it gradually de&s;cended lower till it came over <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> where it was about 39 Miles high; and that where it brake, over the Sea, and o|ver <HI>Bretaign</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> its Altitude could not be very much above 30 Miles.</P>
<P>As to the Mona&s;tery burnt in <HI>France,</HI> it was the Day before the Appearance of this Meteor, and &s;o had no Relation to it. And the like is to be &s;aid of &s;ome o|ther Accidents el&s;ewhere, none of which appear to have at all been occa&s;ion'd by it.</P>
