<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is no ta&s;k performed with &s;uch real devotion, or that can be &s;o properly in place, as that which &s;prings from private inclination, and is &s;anctioned by public duty.</P>
<P>That private inclination dictates this addre&s;s; witne&s;s the gratitude with which your Lord&s;hip's unexampled liberality has indelibly impre&s;&s;ed me, and which
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
is irre&s;i&s;tably my perpetual theme; and your Lord&s;hip's &s;ituation as Lord Cham|berlain of his Maje&s;ty's hou&s;ehold, and Ma&s;ter of the Revels, evidently renders it a public duty in me, to addre&s;s a book, which profe&s;&s;es to record a Hi&s;tory of the Stage, and &s;uch circum&s;tances con|nected with as it relate to your Lord&s;hip's high office, to you, my Lord, and to you alone.</P>
<P>Having, however, been formerly ho|noured with dedicating a work to your Lord&s;hip, my difficulty in acquitting my|&s;elf of this welcome duty would have been in&s;urmountable, had not your Lord&s;hip waved ceremony and precedent by gene|rou&s;ly conde&s;cending to relieve me from this embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>I could long dwell, my Lord, upon this &s;ubject; long indulge my willing in|clination with de&s;cribing in how many ways my reputation has been advanced by
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
your Lord&s;hip's patronage and protection; but that the &s;ame feeling which impels me to be grateful forbids me to be importu|nate. Nobly to confer, is the mo&s;t exalted exerci&s;e of the human mind. May you, my Lord, long live to enjoy that be&s;t of propen&s;ities, &s;o congenial to the munifi|cent, and in particular to your Lord&s;hip; and may every object of &s;uch benevolence be in&s;pired with the pride, and the &s;en&s;i|bility of obligation, which is truly felt, but cannot be adequately expre&s;&s;ed, by</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS work once collated and gathered into volumes, I had intended, as my original adverti&s;ement &s;tates, to have gone into it at length by way of preface, to have enumerated every particular that might be nece&s;&s;ary for its illu&s;tration, to have given &s;uch rea&s;ons for every part of my own conduct as in that ca&s;e would have been due to the public, and &s;uch an&s;wers to all tho&s;e who have anonymou&s;ly prai&s;ed and cen&s;ured me as might en&s;ure my opinions the award of candour and imparti|ality.</P>
<P>When I made this ra&s;h promi&s;e, however, for ra&s;h it was be|yond precedent, I was not aware that, to acquit my&s;elf of this almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible ta&s;k, I mu&s;t have added at lea&s;t five volumes to tho&s;e five I now publi&s;h, and all this, perhaps, to lead my|&s;elf into &s;crapes with numerous individuals; a predicament, which it is neither my inclination nor my intere&s;t to ri&s;k. I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with a few general remarks, let|ting prai&s;e or cen&s;ure light upon the work, according as tho&s;e may be inclined to indulge either propen&s;ity, who deliberately peru&s;e it, without which degree of attention it cannot be read to any purpo&s;e; and, in&s;tead of &s;hewing how readers ought to be plea&s;ed, explain in what manner I have endeavoured to plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>The prodigious ma&s;s of materials perpetually at variance with one another, that I have had the &s;lavery to wade through
<PB N="ii" REF="7">
precluded all po&s;&s;ibility of a particular elucidation; for they were a complete chaos of jarring atoms, out of which I defy any man to have formed a perfect hi&s;torical world; and, there|fore, to have taken them otherwi&s;e than according to their ge|neral bearing, however it might have encouraged ingenuity, would not have favoured fidelity. Under this impre&s;&s;ion I have e&s;tabli&s;hed judgment as the arbitrator between tho&s;e two competitors, of which article I have certainly given up to the &s;ubject all that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which is as much, as any rea&s;on|able reader can de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I might perhaps have exerci&s;ed this nece&s;&s;ary quality more deliberately, had not a number of circum&s;tances intervened that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to have fore&s;een. I had no idea, when I began the Hi&s;tory of the Stage, that I &s;hould take a circuit of between three and four thou&s;and miles during the pro&s;ecu|tion of it, and be in con&s;equence obliged to di&s;patch copy written upon the &s;pur of the moment to a printer, &s;ometimes at four hundred miles di&s;tance, who, had he been paid to have in|volved me in every difficulty and inconvenience, could not more completely have di&s;charged this retrogade office. I might, to be &s;ure, have given it up at the end of the fir&s;t volume, but this would have violated my re&s;pect due to the &s;ub&s;cribers, and my re|gard to my own reputation; and, as to foregoing every thing el&s;e upon this account, I appeal to the candid, for whom I have as graceful a deference as I have an ineffable contempt for cavil|lers, whether it would not have been a &s;upererogate and ab&s;urd in&s;tance of quixoti&s;m, if, for the &s;ake of watching the pre&s;s, and of dige&s;ting hi&s;torical matter into mere form, I had given up pro&s;pects which have confirmed my health, enlarged my connexions, and augmented my intere&s;t and my reputation, e&s;pecially as by the experiment I &s;hould have lo&s;t the activity of truth, and gained nothing but its preci&s;ion, in which parti|cular,
<PB N="iii" REF="8">
perhaps after all I have been virtually; as correct as my neighbours.</P>
<P>A mere hi&s;tory of theatrical events, I take to be a very in|&s;ipid thing. I con&s;ider the Stage as a &s;tate branching from the empire of literature, and therefore an examination of its rulers, and the ri&s;e and operation of the various circum&s;tances i&s;&s;uing from its general intere&s;t, cannot be related to effect without dige&s;ting different opinions and forming a rational judgment of them. In this, one is apt to be a little dictatorial, which, however, is a merit; for it implies that, after every nece&s;&s;ary examina|tion you have fully per&s;uaded your&s;elf that certain facts exi&s;t, and therefore you naturally expect an implicit acquie&s;cence on the part of the reader, provided your general rea&s;oning have made the matter clear. In this view, the hi&s;torian may expect and ought to be credited; for, if every trivial fact were to be argued upon, the chain of narrative would be perpetually broken through, and nothing would be concluded.</P>
<P>It is upon this broad ground I wi&s;h this book to be judged. Indeed I think it ought to acknowledge no other authority; for I will venture to &s;ay that any thing written upon the con|viction of long experience will be more likely in its e&s;&s;ence to be faithfully authentic, than a hi&s;tory compo&s;ed, or rather vamped, from a whole library of printed and written docu|ments; e&s;pecially when to my own knowledge many articles in even recent publications, relative to the theatre, are com|pletely fal&s;e.</P>
<P>It is no &s;ubject of wonder therefore, though heaven knows, I have had recour&s;e to printed documents and written ones too, many of them, thanks to tho&s;e bu&s;y gentlemen who &s;eem to have had but little to do with their time, through the medium of
<PB N="iv" REF="9">
the penny po&s;t, that I have had more difficulty in avoiding fancied errors that in coming at evident truths; and here I cannot help reflecting on the egregious ab&s;urdity of tho&s;e who have been &s;o officiou&s;ly friendly as to tender opinions which I could not but &s;ee, or el&s;e I mu&s;t be fit for Bedlam, were traps for my veracity; and yet, poor devils, I forgive them. Indeed they are my friends without their own knowledge; for the an|ticipation of an injury is next to the enjoyment of a benefit. As to all tho&s;e who from real kindne&s;s and friendly &s;olicitude, have &s;hewn an anxiety for my reputation in the cour&s;e of this work, I &s;hould have to accu&s;e my&s;elf of every thing unworthy and un|grateful if I did not feel their genero&s;ity and acknowledge the advantages derived from their advice; but of this they will be con&s;cious, by an ob&s;ervation of the u&s;e I have made of their va|rious remarks.</P>
<P>My great difficulty has been to curtail; for, from the large cargo of matter I have had the drudgery to con&s;ult, my ta&s;k had been as trouble&s;ome as that of a manager in the &s;horten|ing an overgrown play. I have therefore never teazed the reader with dates of births, or deaths, or any times or actions, that I have conceived to be irrelative to the e&s;&s;ence of the facts I have commemorated. I have al&s;o cut out &s;econd titles where|ever I could; by the ab&s;ence of all which extraneous matter I have been able to crib room for anecdotes and other articles which I conceived would be much more entertaining to the reader. Above all, I have as much as po&s;&s;ible omitted Chri&s;|tian, or fir&s;t names; a circum&s;tance which may in &s;ome in&s;tances perhaps be taken in dudgeon, though certainly nothing can be a greater compliment. I remember, when Garrick was ab&s;urd|ly particular on this &s;ubject. A lady of di&s;tinction wrote her friend a minute account of the Jubilee, in the moment the little man returned home, with all his blu&s;hing honours thick
<PB N="v" REF="10">
about him. In this account &s;he frequently called him Garrick, without any prefatory appellation. He was told of it, and re|marked, that it was a &s;trange want of attention, for that it might at lea&s;t have been Mr. Garrick. The lady heard of this, and wrote him a letter, profe&s;&s;ing to apologi&s;e for the omi&s;&s;ion, but yet full of clo&s;e and keen irony. Among other things, &s;he &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that nothing could be farther from her intention than the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of an impropriety. She only wrote while her heart was full, at which moment &s;he could no more have &s;aid Mr. Garrick, than Mr. Shake&s;peare."</Q></P>
<P>To enumerate the various objects this &s;ubject embraces would give this addre&s;s more the form of a pro&s;pectus to re|commend a work, than a preface to the work it&s;elf. The Hi&s;|tory of the Stage is now publi&s;hed, and let it &s;tand or fall by its general merits. It may not, however, be irrelevant to notice that mu&s;ic has never been treated, as it relates to the Theatre, till now.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this intru&s;ion by intreating that I only de&s;ire to receive that proportion of commendation to which a fair con|&s;truction of the above remarks may entitle me; that the letter may be con&s;idered as comprized in the &s;pirit of the work; that inferior faults may be liberally overlooked; in &s;hort, that I may find, as far as they are my due as to the literary part of this undertaking which re&s;ted with me, credit for good intention, indu&s;try, and di&s;crimination, in the candour and con&s;ideration of my readers; and for the typographical part, which did not re&s;t with me, an errata in their genero&s;ity and indulgence.</P>

<HEAD>THE STAGE.</HEAD>
<HEAD>BOOK IX. FROM THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF CARRICK TO HIS DEPARTURE FOR ITALY.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH STAGE, AND A CONTINUATION OF AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now upon the point of introducing the greate&s;t actor that ever exi&s;ted, for &s;o we mu&s;t pro|nounce GARRICK to have been if all we have wit|ne&s;&s;ed of him, added to all we have been told of others, be fairly weighed and con&s;idered, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew how many adventitious circum|&s;tances combined together to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that merit which, like every thing el&s;e tran&s;cendant, re|ceived brilliancy from competition.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12">The collateral advantages from which GARRICK derived a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in a higher degree than BETTER|TON, were the large and valuable &s;tock of materials with which the &s;tage had been furni&s;hed originally at home, as well as tho&s;e imported from FRANCE; which la&s;t, however inferior to the &s;terling value of meritorious Engli&s;h productions, by lending a va|riety to dramatic entertainments, heightened con&s;i|derably the effect of talents &s;o ver&s;atile as tho&s;e of this actor.</P>
<P>It will be unnece&s;&s;ary again to go over the ground of the French drama, or to &s;hew that, whatever there might have been both of theatrical regularity and &s;prightline&s;s, there was a pancity, and a &s;ame|ne&s;s, which the wor&s;t Engli&s;h writers would have di&s;dained to copy, or, indeed, if they had copied, the dulle&s;t Engli&s;h auditor would have been ab&s;urd enough to tolerate. VANBRUGH, neverthele&s;s, turned MOLIERE and REGNARD to advantage, DESTOUCHES, Le SAGE, BOURSAULT, and at length VOLTAIRE, and many others, became fa&s;hion|able when metamorpho&s;ed by their Engli&s;h tran&s;la|tors, and that merit which it has been pretty clearly &s;hewn that the French originally derived from us, after being filtered into in&s;ipidity by them, rege|nerated by being again revived in its more congenial
<PB N="7" REF="13">
&s;oil, exactly as our golden pippin, planted in AME|RIA, enlarges in bulk and degenerates in flavour, but which, replanted in ENGLAND, regains its u&s;ual &s;ize, and embibes its original &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>The French authors, who died in the interval between SHAKESPEAR and GARRICK, a li&s;t of which I have before me where I count more than four hundred and fifty, many of them voluminous writers, inundated the theatre with an incomprehen|&s;ible number of pieces&mdash;but what were they? The mo&s;t trifling and flimzy popular anecdote was &s;ub|ject enough for a French comedy, and this maigre kind of diet made their &s;ea&s;on of acting plays a &s;ort of dramatic Lent, and the Dorantes, and Era&s;tes, the Scapins, the Cri&s;pins, and the Blai&s;es, differently dre&s;&s;ed and ornamented, were &s;tuffed down their throats, like the painted eggs in <HI>Careme,</HI> which, whe|ther you chu&s;e red, yellow, blue, or purple, are &s;till hard, undege&s;tible and in&s;ipid, and &s;till eggs.</P>
<P>The&s;e would not content an Engli&s;h &s;tomach, and, therefore, none of their plays were ever tran&s;|lated to advantage, except by tho&s;e who knew how to incorporate with them a little &s;tamina. When they were brought out here in that &s;tate, it cannot be denied that we have benefited by the chance,
<PB N="8" REF="14">
of which the <HI>Confederacy,</HI> and <HI>Zara,</HI> are &s;till &s;triking proofs. The contrary has however, at particular periods prevailed, and we have &s;een genteel come|dies, and &s;entimental comedies, bani&s;h for a time, fair humour and hone&s;t laughter from the &s;tage.</P>
<P>But, as there will hereafter come an opportunity when we may indulge in ob&s;ervation upon this &s;ub|ject, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent wave this and every thing el&s;e to bring up the account of authors till 1741, after which, to the death of GARRICK, though there will remain plenty of names, and certainly &s;ome ad|mirable materials, it is wonderful how little that can be called excellent, will be &s;ound when the number of admirable actors are con&s;idered that gave advan|tage to literary fame during that period.</P>
<P>To prepare my way for this examination, I mu&s;t &s;lightly touch again on tho&s;e who&s;e productions are yet brought no further than 1708, and the fir&s;t left in that imperfect &s;tate, was STEELE, who&s;e private conduct, having already been noticed pretty much at large as it was involved in the hi&s;tory of theatrical management, it will be only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak now of The <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers,</HI> his la&s;t play that was performed, though there are two other plays attributed to him, called, The <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> and The <HI>School of Action.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="15">The <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> is an in&s;tance that there is no danger in permitting an author to borrow when he knows as well as STEELE did how to improve his ma|terials. This comedy which was produced in 1721, is imitated from the <HI>Andria</HI> of TERENCE, but im|proved exactly in the way that an excellent engra|ver imortalizes an in&s;ipid and &s;piritle&s;s painter. Here, however, the compari&s;on drops for it is not only heightened, &s;o as to be &s;uperlatively &s;uperior to the original, but embelli&s;hed with &s;cenes of great in|trin&s;ic merit purely the author's own. Among the&s;e are every thing that belongs to Tom and Phillis, and that admirable &s;cene between Myrtle and Bevil, in which duelling is execrated in &s;o no|ble and &s;o dignified a manner, from which &s;cene RICHARDSON has evidently taken more than a hint in <HI>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>We now go to Mrs. CENTLIVRE's comedy of the <HI>Bu&s;y Body,</HI> which proves that members of a theatre have not in all ca&s;es any very &s;trong eventual judgment; for, as we have &s;een, it was expected to be damned, and even WILKS &s;wore that no audience would ever endure &s;uch &s;tuff. The event, as we well know, gave the lie to their predictions, and whenever there has been a good Marplot it has never cea&s;ed to be a popular play.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16">The <HI>Man's Bewitched,</HI> performed in 1710, has the u&s;ual fault of Mrs. CENTLIVRE's plays. It is flimzy; it is however &s;prightly and full of whim, and tho&s;e, who have an inclination to leave rigid critici&s;m at home, may laugh very heartily at many of the inci|dents whenever they are well acted. <HI>Bicker&s;taff's Unburrying, Marplet,</HI> a &s;equel to the <HI>Bu&s;y Body,</HI> and the <HI>Perplexed Lovers</HI> add little to this lady's repu|tation, and will never again, perhaps, trouble the public.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wonder,</HI> performed 1713, is certainly the be&s;t of Mrs. CENTLIVRE's plays; and, for an in|tricate and perplexed plot, is one of the fulle&s;t of in|tere&s;t and plea&s;antry that can be conceived. There is nothing that the dulle&s;t auditor cannot ea&s;ily con|ceive, and yet the whole depends upon a my&s;tery in|extricable to the characters them&s;elves. Jealou&s;y in comedy is, perhaps, depicted in this play better than in any other, and the characters are highly drawn, and &s;trongly contra&s;ted. It requires, however, ex|cellent acting, and perhaps, Felix was never repre|&s;ented to perfection, from its fir&s;t appearance to this moment, but by GARRICK.</P>
<P>Mrs. CENTLIVRE, &s;eems to have written well only at intervals. The <HI>Gotham Election,</HI> The <HI>Wi&s;e Well Managed,</HI> and The <HI>Cruel Gift,</HI> not having the
<PB N="11" REF="17">
gift of plea&s;ing the public, or en&s;uring any reputation for their writer. The latter of the&s;e pieces was a tragedy, and therefore too ponderous a &s;ubject for &s;o feeble a pen.</P>
<P><HI>A Bold Stroke for a Wi&s;e,</HI> which except The <HI>Artifice,</HI> a comedy that had no &s;ucce&s;s, is the la&s;t of this writers productions, was brought out in 1718. It is by no means a good play, for the language is poor, and the circum&s;tances impo&s;&s;ible; but there is &s;o much of whim, contrivance, and plea&s;ant va|riety in it, that it is difficult to refrain from laughing at different parts of it. The performance, however, of Feignwell is &s;o hard a ta&s;k that the part has never yet been acted in all its requi&s;ites to perfection.</P>
<P>SOUTHERN remains yet to be &s;poken of, &s;o does CIBBER, with whom I &s;hall fini&s;h the account of re|&s;umed authors. The <HI>Spartan Dame,</HI> which was pro|duced in 1719, though it has not kept the &s;tage, is by no means a trifling addition to the &s;ame of this charm|ing writer. The heroine of this play is finely drawn, and the language has, a great deal of that nature, and pathos, that characterize &s;o markingly the beauties of SOUTHERN. This play, nobody knows why, was prohibited for a con&s;iderable time. One attempt more, an abortive one, clo&s;es the li&s;t of this author's
<PB N="12" REF="18">
productions, in which tho&s;e requi&s;ites of exqui&s;ite beauty and impre&s;&s;ive intere&s;t that I have with plea|&s;ure enumerated, &s;tand highly di&s;tingui&s;hed among the be&s;t excellencies of tragedy,</P>
<P>CIBBER's remaining pieces are twelve in num|ber. The <HI>Rival Fools</HI> was performed in 1709. It did not &s;ucceed owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure to tho&s;e enemies that CIBBER's comfortable &s;ituation very naturally conjured up again&s;t him. It has a re&s;em|blance of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER's <HI>Wit at &s;everal Weapons,</HI> but is not &s;o good an improvement on the&s;e authors as CIBBER's amendments gene|rally were.</P>
<P><HI>Venus and Adonis</HI> is merely an interlude, and one of tho&s;e things which managers, inconveniently enough, are now and then con&s;trained to prepare to eke out other matter. The mu&s;ic was compo&s;ed by PEPUSCH, who had great merit, but who too &s;er|vilely &s;hrunk under the influence of HANDEL. <HI>Myrtillo</HI> is criticized by the above comment on <HI>Venus and Adonis,</HI></P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> confe&s;&s;edly taken from MOLIERE's <HI>Tartuffe,</HI> but materially improved. The <HI>Coquet of High Life</HI> has never been drawn &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="19">
well upon the whole as by CIBBER; and after Lady Betty Modi&s;h, perhaps Maria, is in his bolde&s;t and true&s;t manner. Nothing can an&s;wer the true end and drift of real comedy better than the operation of this piece upon the human mind. A pernicious &s;erpent, under the veil of &s;anctity, who gets ad|mittance into the hou&s;e of a gentleman to work his ruin by the &s;eduction of his family, it is the true province of the &s;tage to expo&s;e and puni&s;h.</P>
<P>CIBBER, however, got all the critics again&s;t him, as had MOLIERE before him; and, as they were &s;tirred up by tho&s;e who did not, perhaps, chu&s;e to appear openly, for fear of appropriating to them|&s;elves &s;ome of tho&s;e fair &s;trokes of &s;atire which could alone be levelled again&s;t the villany of hypocricy, they employed, by way of a vehicle, <HI>Mi&s;t's Journal,</HI> a paper of all work, and it is &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, not without great colour of truth, that POPE was not a little active in this dirty work, for it happened immediately after the damnation of that farce written by POPE, ARBUTHNOT, and GAY, which we know gave ri&s;e to the enmity of POPE again&s;t CIBBER, and introduced the <HI>Laureat</HI> into the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>CIBBER with his u&s;ual gaiety and good nature, for it mu&s;t be allowed that he had the good &s;en&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="20">
never to be hurt by folly of this kind, &s;peaks of this circum&s;tance with the &s;ame coolne&s;s with which he wrote to POPE, where he mo&s;t pointedly &s;hews the malignity and burning envy that had actuated all his conduct, towards him, merely one would think be|cau&s;e nature had not given him the talent to write plays. The <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> in &s;pite of all its enemies, had great &s;ucce&s;s, and made a con&s;iderable addition to its author's reputation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MIST &s;eems to be extremely angry with CIBBER that he could never &s;o far catch him off his guard as to give him any reply, and got at la&s;t &s;o exa&s;perated at finding that nothing could irritate him, that a paragraph appeared in his paper, when CIBBER lay very ill, that he was dead.

<P><HI>Ximena,</HI> performed in 1709, is a tragedy, a &s;ort of productions in which CIBBER certainly did not excel. It is in &s;ome degree taken from The <HI>Cid</HI> of CORNEILLE. The <HI>Refu&s;al, or the Lady's Philo&s;ophy,</HI> borrowed principally from <HI>Les Femmes Savantes</HI> of MOLIERE, had not &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s as it de&s;erved. MIST and his abetters had not forgot The <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> and be&s;ides the &s;evere &s;trokes in it which were le|velled at the famous South Sea bubble, were not

ea&s;ily pardoned by tho&s;e they expo&s;ed; though no|thing can be fairer game for &s;cenic detection than any &s;pecies of national fraud. <HI>Cae&s;ar in Egypt</HI> is an|other tragedy, the &s;ubject of which is furni&s;hed by CORNEILLE. It would have been better for CIB|BER and the &s;tage if he had employed the time he took to prepare this piece for the theatre, by writing a comedy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Provoked Hu&s;band,</HI> as the world knows, was left in an unfini&s;hed &s;tate by VANBRUGH, and brought forward with material alterations by CIB|BER; indeed more than half of it was written by him; VANBRUGH having written little more than that part of it which relates to &s;ir Francis Wronghead and his family. CIBBER's enemies, however, determined to do the thing judiciou&s;ly, cho&s;e to &s;elect what they &s;uppo&s;ed to be his, and right or wrong damned VANBRUGH when they thought they were damning CIBBER. This he detected to their confu&s;ion, by publi&s;hing the play as VANBRUGH had left it be|hind him, and thus he proved, to the &s;atisfaction of every &s;en&s;ible critic, with how much judgment he had improved a celebrated author without injuring his fame.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rival Queens</HI> was a parody on LEE's <HI>Alex|ander.</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="22">
We know but little of its reputation, yet, though it had &s;ome humour, it is very unlikely that it had &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Love in a Riddle</HI> was a pa&s;toral, and one of the earlie&s;t pieces of this kind brought out after the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> It is wonderful how CIB|BER could &s;ee &s;o little of probable con&s;equences as to imagine that any thing written profe&s;&s;edly in imitation of a piece &s;o very popular, let whatever be its merit, could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed. There can be no doubt but party, right or wrong, wrought the fall of this opera; for it certainly had merit, and the idea of the author's endeavour to &s;trike a ballance in favour of morality by making virtue as captivating as GAY had rendered vice alluring, was perfectly laudable; but to oppo&s;e the torrent of fa&s;hion is always madne&s;s, and CIBBER ought to have known better. The piece, cut down to a farce, under the title of <HI>Damon and Phillida,</HI> has always been con|&s;idered as an entertaining trifle.</P>
<P><HI>Papal Tyranny in the reign of King John,</HI> is by no means borrowed from SHAKESPEAR's play, though written upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. In this play CIBBER, in imitation of AESOP, returned to the &s;tage very late in life, for it came out in 1744, at which time its author was &s;eventy-three. He did not, however, meet, with the reception of AESOP;
<PB N="17" REF="23">
for, in &s;pite of the impediments nature had added to tho&s;e he formerly laboured under, there was a dignity and a grace in his performance of Pandolph which the public very warmly applauded. The play had merit, but it is very probable that the actor &s;aved the author, or at lea&s;t reaped the greate&s;t &s;hare of public favour. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that no <HI>King John</HI> has &s;ince been popular but that written by SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P>With <HI>Hob in the Well,</HI> which is well known, and no more than DOGGET's <HI>Country Wake</HI> cut into a farce, we take leave of CIBBER; an author, a ma|nager, and an actor, who&s;e whole &s;tudy was to pro|mote the credit, the character, and the con&s;equence of the theatre; who, in his writing, as well as in all his public conduct, was the encourager of merit, the friend of decorum, and the advocate of morality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ADDISON, GAY, FIELDING, AND HILL.</HEAD>
<P>AS the authors, immediately preceding GARRICK, furni&s;hed many of the materials with which he worked out his fame, it is proper to continue a clear ac|count of them till his appearance. We have, there|fore, yet to examine all tho&s;e who wrote in the in|terval between 1708 and 1741.</P>
<P>ADDISON, a very great ornament to letters in this country, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many of the u&s;eful requi&s;ites of an author, and hit the middle line of writing with more felicity and exactne&s;s, than per|haps any other, claims a place here as the author of <HI>Calo, Ro&s;amond,</HI> and The <HI>Drummer.</HI> It will not, how|ever, be enough to mention his plays; for, though I cannot be of opinion with Dr. JOHNSON that it is either worth while or nece&s;&s;ary to give our days and nights to the labours of ADDISON as the ultimatum of atchieving an Engli&s;h &s;tyle, yet many of tho&s;e labours are valuable and an advantage to literature.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25">The <HI>Spectator,</HI> certainly not originally ADDISON's idea but that of STEELE, who began the <HI>Tatler,</HI> a work of the &s;ame complexion, without the partici|pation of any other writer, has in it particular papers which have &s;uch a peculiar neatne&s;s, for what they are, as perhaps cannot be parallelled. Tho&s;e e&s;&s;ays which are written on the common and ordinary oc|currences of life, are wonderfully adapted to all ca|pacities, and at the &s;ame time they teach an elegance of &s;peaking and thinking, they have a drift more no|ble; no le&s;s than that of regulating the mind, and teaching the heart to love morality.</P>
<P>When ADDISON goes beyond the&s;e known and obvious &s;ubjects, he however is not &s;o happy. His zeal is as fervid, and his motives as &s;incere; but his arguments are often fallacious, and he &s;eems more to have the wi&s;h than the ability to convince. As, how|ever, common readers do not make this di&s;tinction, his end is generally obtained; and, whatever may be the nice difference which oblige men of di&s;cern|ment to give him that credit for the will which they cannot for the deed, it were to be wi&s;hed that the youth of both &s;exes might be re&s;tricted from reading that abominable tra&s;h which lumbers up the circu|lating libraries, and obliged to trea&s;ure the admira|ble le&s;&s;ons which will be found in ADDISON's pa|pers in this publication.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26">As for the re&s;t of his pro&s;e, it was generally pro|voked from him to &s;erve that party purpo&s;e, which for the moment he e&s;pou&s;ed, and we &s;ee him pro|moted from a pen&s;ion of three hundred a year, to the place of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, mounting &s;tep by &s;tep to the top of preferment's ladder, of which his va|rious publications formed the rounds. All this is manife&s;ted in various papers in The <HI>Guardian,</HI> The <HI>Freeholder,</HI> The <HI>Old Whig,</HI> and other productions.</P>
<P>As to his poetry, however it might have been extolled by tho&s;e whom he patronized, it has now found its level; and, when we hear from his ad|mirers, of which they are now but few, that his <HI>Ode to St. Cecilia</HI> is beautifully correct, though it is a poor copy from DRYDEN, that The <HI>Letter from Italy</HI> is more correct, though Dr. JOHNSON acu&s;es him of having made a godde&s;s a hor&s;e, and a boat, in two lines by bridling her for fear &s;he &s;hould launch into a &s;ong, and that The <HI>Campaign</HI> is corrector &s;till of which nobody remembers any thing but the <HI>Angel,</HI> borrowed, though it has e&s;caped all his critics, from <HI>King David,</HI> we are furni&s;hed with all the prai&s;e be&s;towed on ADDISON as a poet.</P>
<P>Though I have by no means the &s;malle&s;t incli|nation to qualify the foregoing paragraph, it cannot be denied that ADDISON has &s;ome &s;terling merit as
<PB N="21" REF="27">
a poet, but whenever poetry is derived from eru|dition rather than from genius it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be in proportion le&s;s intrin&s;ic, and occa&s;ional and com|plimentary ver&s;es, however well written, claim a place only on the thre&s;hold of Parna&s;&s;us.</P>
<P>ADDISON's fir&s;t dramatic piece was <HI>Ro&s;amond.</HI> It was performed in 1704, and contains, perhaps, more lines truly poetical than any thing he has written. It is, however, flimzy; and, though there is &s;ome attempt at comedy in <HI>Sir Tru&s;ty and Gride|line,</HI> the whole is a drawing in water colours, neat, correct, and pretty, but neither intere&s;ting, warm, or beautiful. A great deal has been urged to prove that it was a folly in ADDISON to write &s;o well for mu&s;ic, which he him&s;elf &s;ays, as we have &s;een, ought only to be coupled with non&s;en&s;e. Now it &s;o happens that this remark &s;tigmatizes for one thing <HI>Alexander's Fea&s;t,</HI> and for another thing MILTON's <HI>Comus,</HI> and TICKEL, ADDISON's <HI>Dumby,</HI> in&s;i&s;ts upon this rule &s;o &s;trongly, in a flaming copy of ver&s;es, that he &s;ays poetical compo&s;itions for mu&s;ic are
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"innocent of thought,"</Q>
meaning to &s;hew, by a &s;troke of his own, that he knows what it is to be both ignorant and dull, for poetical compo&s;itions cannot think; but, if they could, it would be difficult to prove why thought mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily imply guilt.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="28">It is not very material to go at length into the merits of <HI>Cato.</HI> It is a mo&s;t ponderous tragedy, and was rated, at lea&s;t, according to its weight. It ran for eighteen nights, and was u&s;hered into notice by eight complimentary ver&s;es, be&s;ides a prologue by POPE, and an epilogue by GARTH. It is by much the be&s;t written of all ADDISON's poetical works; and, that they may &s;ecurely rate its real merit, it is decided by the French to be a true model for tragedy; that is to &s;ay, it is the e&s;&s;ence of every thing heavy, dull, and declamatory.</P>
<P>At the time this play made its appearance, it was con&s;idered and taken up as a party bu&s;ine&s;s. CIBBER tells us that the whigs applauded it as a warm compliment to their cau&s;e, and the tories re|echoed the applau&s;e to &s;hew that they were not hurt. POPE &s;ays, that at every two lines of his prologue he was clapped into a &s;taunch whig, and that at the &s;ame time the author was &s;weating behind the &s;cenes to find that the applau&s;e came more from the hand than the head.</P>
<P><HI>Cato</HI> has been too warmly admired, and too &s;everely cen&s;ured. VOLTAIRE has run into both the&s;e errors. Great French poets with le&s;s judgment have found in it no errors at all. DENNIS, who&s;e ob&s;ervations
<PB N="23" REF="29">
were always warped, has neverthele&s;s hit upon a great deal of truth in his &s;trictures on <HI>Cato.</HI> His ri|dicule of ADDISON's having religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, the unity of place, and thereby rendered the action impo&s;&s;ible, is as good as any thing in the rehear&s;al, and it cannot be denied that, as to conduct, there is nothing on the &s;tage more completely ab&s;urd than the management of the circum&s;tances in this play.</P>
<P>Time has, as u&s;ual, &s;ettled every di&s;pute upon this &s;ubject. The day of prejudice is gone by, and, without reference to any party or any opinion, we &s;oberly find that <HI>Cato</HI> is more properly a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of declamatory &s;cenes than a tragedy; elegantly written, perfectly moral, and correctly in nature. We care no more about the characters than we are &s;olicitous about the deliverer of a &s;ermon; we li&s;ten to the &s;entiments, we admire the beauty of their language, and we are delighted with the morality they convey. We are told that ADDISON was of this opinion, but that it was hurried on the &s;tage through the importunity of his friends. Party pre|judice turned out a lucky hit, otherwi&s;e, as the ex|perience of the pre&s;ent time evinces, ADDISON would have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of upbraiding his friends for inflicting on him a mortification which his own better judgment had warned him to avoid.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30">The <HI>Drummer,</HI> out of exce&s;&s;ive mode&s;ty, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, ADDISON &s;ought to have concealed his preten&s;ions to as its author; nay, we have nothing but &s;trong circum&s;tances to warrant his being con&s;i|dered &s;o at this moment. STEELE kept the &s;ecret till after his friend's death, and then a&s;&s;erted that he only knew it by a circum&s;tance; having been told by ADDISON, who put the play into his hands while &s;ome friends were pre&s;ent, that it was the production of a gentleman in company. The trait is &s;ingu|lar and has been productive of &s;ome di&s;putation. STEELE's conduct, however, &s;eems to be full of ve|racity and honour.</P>
<P>Willing to give every bird of Parna&s;&s;us its proper feather he took an opportunity, when the feelings of the author could no longer be hurt, and indeed when the play had grown into a fame which was at fir&s;t denied it, of placing it among ADDISON's works ob|&s;erving that it made no figure on the &s;tage originally, though exqui&s;itely well acted,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and when I ob|&s;erve this,"</Q>
&s;ays he," <Q REND="inline margQuotes">I &s;ay a much harder thing of the public than of the comedy."</Q> It is &s;aid that both THEOBALD and TICKELL, knew the truth of this bu&s;ine&s;s even more correctly than STEELE, and that CONGREVE was very &s;evere upon TICKELL for his taciturnity.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31">Certainly, con&s;idered as a play, it is the be&s;t in AD|DISON's works, for it is as WARTON &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a ju&s;t pic|ture of life and manners,"</Q>
and indeed the characters have a truth and a propriety that might have &s;erved as a model, as WARTON hints, for more expert dramatic writers. There is a novelty and an intere&s;t in the fable, and none of the requi&s;ites are for a mo|ment violated; but the mi&s;fortune is that it is correct even to coldne&s;s, and, as <HI>Cato</HI> was tran&s;lated by DES CHAMPS, and pronounced the model of French tragedy, &s;o was the <HI>Drummer</HI> by DESTOUCHES, and pronounced the model of French comedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot refrain from noticing the principal heads of the pre|face to the French play of The <HI>Drummer.</HI> DESTOUCHES &s;ays that he does not copy DRYDEN, and other Engli&s;h writers; who, after enriching them&s;elves at the expence of French authors, write long prefaces to critici&s;e them and turn them into ridicule in&s;tead of ac|knowledging their obligations to them. On the contrary he frankly owns he has borrowed this play from the great ADDISON, one of the be&s;t Engli&s;h authors, and who had not the lea&s;t aver&s;ion to French literature, which he has proved by imitating the exactitude and the decorum of the dramatic productions of that country. This comedy did not &s;ucceed on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, and no wonder, for it had too much &s;implicity and regularity, and too few incidents. It had too much of the wi&s;dom of the French manners, and too little of tho&s;e enormous and mon&s;trous liberties in which the comic writers indulge them&s;elves in ENGLAND, mocking at the unities, and &s;tuffing their pieces full of epi&s;odes, till they no longer can be ta&s;ted or under|&s;tood. He goes on cen&s;uring that &s;atire in Engli&s;h authors which he &s;ays attacks every thing and re&s;pects nothing; not even the fair &s;ex, who, however, take nothing ami&s;s if they happen to have their fans with them. He at length winds up this reprobation of Engli&s;h dra|matic writers by advi&s;ing them to form them&s;elves upon the example of the French theatre and &s;hun the licentious works of BEN JONSON, DRYDEN and CONGREVE.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="32">This brief account is all that comes within my province in relation to ADDISON; who, as a man, was too mode&s;t to &s;peak in public, acknowledge his own writings, or in any other way appear to arrogate the &s;malle&s;t merit; yet he comfortably took to him|&s;elf every lucrative &s;ituation that came in his way, and even married the mother of his pupil for ag|grandizement, though he knew he &s;hould not be happy, with all the &s;acerdotal forbearance of a bi&s;hop at his induction, which &s;ituation he is &s;aid once to have aimed at; who was &s;o good, that he under|mined and injured almo&s;t all his friends, &s;ome of which conduct POPE called damning with &s;aint prai&s;e. He took his friend STEELE in execution for a paltry hundred pounds, he &s;ickened with jealou&s;y at POPE's <HI>Homer,</HI> and he prevented the harmle&s;s and amiable GAY from enjoying that court favour which he had been &s;o often promi&s;ed, and was &s;o ju&s;tly entitled to; but he, no doubt, repented of the&s;e faults before he called in Lord WARWICK, to &s;hew
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"how a chri&s;tian ought to die."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">But the Gods took care of <HI>Cato,</HI> and fortune of ADDISON, and there is a &s;pice of inflated vanity, of hypocritical affectation both in the author and his nominal prototype; a circum&s;tance that po&s;terity has pretty well regulated. We have here, however, no|thing to do with him but as a writer, in which capa|city he is better known by infinite degrees by tho&s;e papers in The <HI>Spectator,</HI> where he has treated familiar and dome&s;tic &s;ubjects, in, which narrow circle no|body ever moved &s;o nimbly or &s;o expertly, than by the re&s;t of his writings. The&s;e will &s;ecure him a peculiar fame, &s;mall indeed, but brilliant; confined but valuable; brilliant becau&s;e they infu&s;e plea&s;ure, and valuable becau&s;e that plea&s;ure mends the heart.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of GAY is &s;o well known, his amia|ble, mild, un&s;u&s;pecting heart, which permitted him to be bubbled by the South Sea &s;cheme, and di&s;ap|pointed at court, without having the power to bear up again&s;t mi&s;fortune, has been &s;o much pitied and applauded, for it broke by the weight of the calamity it &s;u&s;tained, and was afterwards univer&s;ally and de|&s;ervedly commi&s;erated, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay any thing of this valuable man and meritorious wri|ter here that the reader cannot anticipate.</P>
<P>GAY was an elegant poet, as his Pa&s;torals, his
<PB N="28" REF="34">
Trivia, his Fables, and other things evince, and in proof that I &s;peak the general opinion, all the&s;e things are at this moment read with plea&s;ure. It is true they are of a &s;econdary rank; but a great mind may be &s;een through an humble covering, and the violet, and the je&s;&s;amine have charms in their &s;im|plicity with which the lily and the tulip, with all their gaudine&s;s, cannot impre&s;s the heart. If poetry be meant to dignify &s;entiment, to exalt idea, and to charm the mind, why mu&s;t the poet's reputation wait upon lofty and towering &s;ubjects, always fal&s;e, and always dazzling?</P>
<P>When &s;uch a poem as <HI>Alexander's Fea&s;t</HI> a&s;toni&s;hes the world, a circum&s;tance that does not happen per|haps in &s;even centuries, I am willing to give any en|thu&s;ia&s;tic tribute of admiration you plea&s;e to the wonderful effort of extraordinary genius, and feel a &s;ervent glow of gratitude that &s;uch cele&s;tial ideas &s;hould be conceived by a human creature; but, for feeling, for pathos, for mental plea&s;ure, for &s;omething delicious to the &s;oul, I had rather, and I am &s;ure I &s;hall have every votary of &s;en&s;ibility on my &s;ide, be the author of <HI>Black eyed Su&s;an</HI> than half the <HI>Odes</HI> of PINDAR.</P>
<P>'Tis the cant of great poets, and the cant of great
<PB N="29" REF="35">
critics, to rate every thing dome&s;tic, every thing fa|miliar, every thing common, among the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of poetry. This mode, however, of narrowing the avenues to the heart is a &s;erious injury to the cau&s;e of rhime, which, by this rule, to be great mu&s;t have every thing of pomp, and nothing of &s;entiment; but the po&s;ition is fal&s;e. The conception achs at being perpetually fixed on grand objects, as our eyes are dazzled by looking full on the fun; we &s;icken at the glare though the genial influence it diffu&s;es is even nece&s;&s;ary to our exi&s;tence. Thus when &s;plendid virtues and &s;triking qualities are brought home to us, and exemplified in real life, the fiction is rea|lized, and the heroes, gods, and guardian angels of poets, are found to have a practical exi&s;tence in the courage, love, and friend&s;hip of common mortals.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e capable of giving poetry this im|pre&s;&s;ion was GAY; who, if he had had nerve equal to idea, would have blendid all that is great in his writings with all that is beautiful, His dramatic pieces are upon various &s;ubjects, and variou&s;ly con|ducted. Some are by no means happy, but none are de&s;titute of merit.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mohocks</HI> is a &s;hort piece attributed to this author, and generally believed to be his. It is in|tended
<PB N="30" REF="36">
to expo&s;e the bucks of that day, who were a terror to all peaceable pa&s;&s;engers, as we read in the <HI>Tatlers</HI> and <HI>Spectators.</HI> It had a laudable tendency, but being temporary we know but little of its &s;uc|ce&s;s. The <HI>Wife of Bath,</HI> 1713, was GAY's first co|medy, but it was an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, and was even rejected by the public upon a revival of it after the appearance of The <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>What d'ye call It,</HI> a burle&s;que production well known, had merit in its way. It was &s;o well acted, as we are told by POPE, that MR. CROM|WELL, who was deaf, could not conceive how the audience could be kept in a roar of laughter while every thing was conducted with &s;uch &s;olemnity on the &s;tage. <HI>Three Hours after Marriage,</HI> though always &s;et down to GAY, was, as CIBBER's letter to POPE &s;ufficiently proves, the production of POPE, GAYS and ARBUTHNOT.</P>
<P>Every body knows that the piece failed, and that POPE grew upon this &s;o inveterate again&s;t all dramatic writers, that he for ever afterwards envied them, and of cour&s;e abuted them in his writings; but it is not generally known that its failure was owing to the &s;pirit of ARISTOPHANES which it breathed. It ri|diculed mo&s;t pointedly, and mo&s;t unde&s;ervedly, a
<PB N="31" REF="37">
very valuable member of &s;ociety becau&s;e he hap|pened to be fond of fo&s;&s;ils, and the public were not at that time ripe for that bold, ungenerous and wan|ton per&s;onality, which I &s;hall certainly warmly re|probate when I come to FOOTE. It, therefore, di&s;|gu&s;ted the audience, and was in con&s;equence very properly withdrawn from the &s;tage.</P>
<P><HI>Dione</HI> was a tragic pa&s;toral, and profe&s;&s;edly in the manner of <HI>Amynta,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;ter Fido,</HI> &s;ubjects which we have &s;een frequently attempted before. It has merit, but when we con&s;ider that RANDOLPH's <HI>Amyntas,</HI> though performed before the King and Queen, had very little public &s;ucce&s;s it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, however it might enrich the poems of GAY, that it was very wi&s;ely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed as a &s;ubject for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captives,</HI> performed in 1723. GAY was uniformly unfortunate in relation to this play. He obtained leave to read it to the Prince&s;s of WALES; but, being very timid, and his attention entirely fixed on the per&s;onages about him, as he advanced to the company a&s;&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion, he made a pantomime trick of his tragedy by tumbling over a &s;tool, overturning a &s;creen, and throwing the audience into the complete&s;t confu&s;ion. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been remembered during the re|pre&s;entation
<PB N="32" REF="38">
of the piece, which, on this and other accounts was very little attended to.</P>
<P>We come now to mention a performance cele|brated more variou&s;ly than any other production in the Engli&s;h language. The reader's recollection anticipates the mention of The <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> a piece which has been critici&s;ed in all manner of ways, and which has begot all manner of opinions. Some of the&s;e I &s;hall pre&s;ently examine. In the mean time let us literally &s;ee its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This piece, as we are told from the notes to the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> was performed &s;ixty three nights, the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and repeated the following &s;ea&s;on with the &s;ame extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s. It was performed thirty or forty times at mo&s;t of the principal towns in the kingdom; at BATH and BRISTOL it was repeated fifty nights. The ladies carried about the favourite &s;ongs in fans, and handkerchiefs, and hou&s;es were furni&s;hed with them in &s;kreens. The <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> was not only performed in ENGLAND but in IRE|LAND, SCOTLAND, and WALES, nay at MINORCA, and many other foreign places.</P>
<P>Its &s;ame was not confined to the author. The actre&s;s who performed Polly, till then an ob&s;cure
<PB N="33" REF="39">
and not a very re&s;pectable character, became all at once the favourite, nay the toa&s;t, of the town. Her portrait was painted, and engraved, and &s;old in great numbers; her life was written, eulogiums in pro&s;e and ver&s;e &s;warmed in the new&s;papers, and in different periodical publications, books were made of her &s;ayings, and je&s;ts; and, to crown all, here I quote SWIFT,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"after being the mother of &s;everal anti|nuptial children, &s;he obtained the rank and title of a duche&s;s by marriage."</Q></P>
<P>As to the tendency of The <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> as if there was no fixed rule whereby to judge of a &s;tage repre&s;entation, nothing can be more contradictory than public opinion concerning it. On one &s;ide Dr. HERRING, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, and a number of adherents, condemned it as giving encouragement to vice by making a high|wayman the hero, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him with reward rather than puni&s;hment. On the other &s;ide, SWIFT, and another large party, contended that the piece was highly moral, for that it is impo&s;&s;ible to place vice in too &s;trong or too odious a light.</P>
<P>SWIFT was certainly more in the right than HERRING; for, if the great, who are &s;everely &s;a|tirized
<PB N="34" REF="40">
in the per&s;ons of Macheath and his gang, are truly &s;atirized, then is the labour of GAY a valuable one; if not he wrote it only for tho&s;e whom the cap might happen to fit; and, as place, and preferment, and bribes, are the vehicles through which all gangs are kept together, no doubt there are characters in the world who are obliged to make wry faces and put it on, for as to HERRING's remark, that the hero goes unpuni&s;hed it is literally, but not virtually, a fact; for the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> was written as well to ridicule the Italian opera as to convey general morality, which la&s;t end the author had it in idea literally to inculcate, and therefore makes the poet &s;ay that it is his intention to hang Macheath, and either to hang or tran&s;port all the re&s;t of the per&s;onages. <Q REND="inline">"Aye,"</Q> &s;ays the player,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"this would be very right provided your piece were a tragedy, but being an opera it it mu&s;t end happily."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Your objection,"</Q> replies the poet,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is very right, but the difficulty is ea&s;ily removed; for, in the&s;e kind of dramas, no matter how ab&s;urdly matters are brought about."</Q>
He then makes the rabble cry a reprieve, and the cap|tain, is brought back to his wives in triumph.</P>
<P>Under this crooked policy, tho&s;e who &s;marted at the &s;atire in this piece affected to &s;hield their feelings; for no man in his &s;en&s;es will aver that refu&s;ing a li|cence
<PB N="35" REF="41">
to the &s;equel to it called <HI>Polly,</HI> which was the next of GAY's productions, was le&s;t, highwaymen and hou&s;ebreakers &s;hould be taught to glory in their wickedne&s;s; but le&s;t corruption &s;hould be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>We know that whenever a magi&s;trate, or other forward character, has wi&s;hed to add to his popu|larity he has pretended to deplore the immorality in the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> Sir JOHN FIELDING did this, and others have done it; but it is difficult to &s;ay why thieves &s;hould think it nece&s;&s;ary to emulate Macheath when they can find the examples of Turpin, and Jack Shepherd, in the Newgate Chron|icle; and, as to any hope of their e&s;caping un|puni&s;hed, the very end of their exi&s;tence would not, according to their ideas, be accompli&s;hed if every thief of them did not make his exit upon his death bed at Tyburn. For the re&s;t, as this piece has &s;o much of what SWIFT calls
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not wit, nor humour, but &s;omething better than either;"</Q>
as the &s;ongs are mo&s;t charmingly written; as the fair purpo&s;es of hone&s;t &s;atire are triumphantly accompli&s;hed; and, la&s;tly, as we owe to this lucky hit the ballad opera, which has very elegibly &s;erved the cau&s;e of the drama, of poetry, and of mu&s;ic; I know not to whom the &s;tage in any one in&s;tance has had more ob|ligations than in this to GAY.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="42"><HI>Polly</HI> was printed by &s;ub&s;cription. The reader has &s;een why it was never performed. It produced a much larger &s;um of money for its author than it could have done had it made its public appearance even had its &s;ucce&s;s been equal to the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> which event is impo&s;&s;ible to have happened, for it had neither the novelty, the intere&s;t, the writing, or any other &s;ingle requi&s;ite of equal merit to recom|mend it, and this &s;hews how ab&s;urd tho&s;e who were inimical to GAY acted, for had they let it come out, it would not only have died away unheeded it&s;elf, but have been a &s;everer reproach to its author than its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; which, rather than injure GAY, lifted him into more con&s;equence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was pretty well evinced, when COLMAN revived it in the year 1777. It was then found to be an in&s;ipid, unentertaining per|formance. A remarkable circum&s;tance happened upon this occa&s;ion. The Duche&s;s of Queen&s;berry, who had been GAY's patrone&s;s, who had made &s;o much intere&s;t to get this piece performed, and who, finding the tide of power &s;o &s;trong again&s;t it, was &s;o very in&s;trumental in procuring its author that large &s;ub&s;cription on the publi&s;hing it, was fifty years afterwards at this repre&s;entation of it in the Hay|market. She was very old and &s;urvived her la&s;t vi&s;it to this pro|duction of her favourite but a few weeks.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Acis and Galatea,</HI> a well known and beautiful written pa&s;toral opera, has been &s;o often repeated and attended to with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that it is un|nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="37" REF="43">
here to dwell upon its merits. As to the mu&s;ic, as a work of genius, it is clearly the be&s;t compo&s;ition of HANDEL. It is a&s;toni&s;hinly varied, and yet always pa&s;toral; nay the very gigantic pipe of Polypheme &s;eems to breath magnified tender|ne&s;s; but I &s;hall go into this more particularly here|after, when I place HANDEL and ARNE by the &s;ide of each other.</P>
<P><HI>Achilles</HI> was again an opera. It has had very little &s;ucce&s;s, either originally, or at any time when it has been revived. The <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Wife,</HI> a comedy, was left fini&s;hed by GAY, but not perhaps to that per|fection it would have been had he lived to have &s;een it brought on the &s;tage. It has been attempted, but without &s;ucce&s;s. There is another thing attributed to this author called The <HI>Rehear&s;al at Gotham,</HI> which we know but little about.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een that no one of his pieces had &s;ucce&s;s any thing equal to The <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> and the rea&s;on, in great mea&s;ure, is, that they were ge|nerally upon the &s;ame plan without the merit of originality, or &s;o fortunate a conveyance. This blunted the edge of the &s;atire, and de&s;troyed the intere&s;t. Another rea&s;on is that the mu&s;ic of The <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> &s;eems to have exhau&s;ted all that was
<PB N="38" REF="44">
to be found beautiful in ballad compo&s;ition, or at lea&s;t it comprehended the mo&s;t choice &s;election; for there cannot be any thing more exqui&s;ite, natural, &s;weet, and delightful, than tho&s;e airs. Who &s;elected them we are not told; they were harmonized by PEPUSCH; and, when we find in them that the be&s;t airs originated as far back as FERRABOSCO and RIZZIO, who only improved what was more an|cient, who &s;hall &s;hew melodies &s;o delicious, &s;o af|fecting, &s;o winning, as tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h, and the Scotch.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een GAY leave a counter to &s;hine in the mo&s;t brilliant circles of poetic attraction; to be prai&s;ed, envied, di&s;appointed, neglected, and at la&s;t to die with a broken heart. The world are cer|tainly the better for this; but as to him&s;elf, how|ever he acquired applau&s;e, patronage, reputation, and Po&s;thumous fame, his life would have been more happy and contented had he pur&s;ued any trade but the trade of a poet.</P>
<P>FIELDING was but an indifferent poet, but he has left behind him one &s;pecies of reputation which no author ever &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His novels have hitherto been unequalled. <HI>Tom Jones</HI> is, per|haps, the fine&s;t a&s;&s;emblage of natural characters and
<PB N="39" REF="45">
happy incidents in any language. <HI>Jo&s;eph Andrews</HI> has a vein of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t gratifying hu|mour within the conception of human ingenuity; and were it not that it is profe&s;&s;edly written as a &s;atire on one author, and in imitation of another, it would be very nearly a complete work in its kind. <HI>Amelia</HI> manife&s;ts a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing judgment of FIELDING's knowledge of the world. There is &s;carcely a per&s;on or circum&s;tance introduced in that novel but every body knows to be &s;omebody or &s;omething already &s;een in real life. In &s;hort, though the&s;e novels may have&mdash;and indeed &s;o has the &s;un, re&s;plendent as it is&mdash;&s;omething to cavil at, yet the wor&s;t of them greatly excels the be&s;t of any other author, if nature, truth, intere&s;t, humour, and cha|racter are the requi&s;ites of &s;uch productions.</P>
<P>FIELDING's dramatic works have great merit, but they are not &s;o well calculated for the &s;tage as the clo&s;et. He could not write ill; and, in general, his dialogue has marks of &s;trong nature and pointed character, but it is too witty. CONGREVE at la&s;t fell off as to &s;ucce&s;s. Sweets will cloy. This is however no reproach, but as men of genius, rather a compliment to both CONGREVE and FIELDING.</P>
<P>As it was impo&s;&s;ible for FIELDING to bring for|ward
<PB N="40" REF="46">
any work unworthy the attention of the pub|lic, &s;o his dramatic pieces have a con&s;iderable claim to applau&s;e, but they were in general &s;light and in|dige&s;ted as to &s;tage effect, the author &s;eeming to fancy that the &s;trong and nervous &s;tyle in which he was at all times capable of writing would an&s;wer every purpo&s;e. In this he was mi&s;taken, for CIB|BER, who did not write &s;o well, by knowing the trim of the theatre and the town had at all times better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>FIELDING's fir&s;t piece was a comedy, called <HI>Love in &s;everal Ma&s;ques.</HI> It came out immediately after The <HI>Provoked Hu&s;band.</HI> It neverthele&s;s had good &s;ucce&s;s, and there is certainly in it &s;ome &s;trong and nervous dialogue. The <HI>Temple Beau</HI> was per|formed at Goodman's Fields in 1730. This was a ha&s;ty play but has neverthele&s;s &s;trong wit and hu|mour; but it is more gay than intere&s;ting, which is FIELDING's great fault. The <HI>Author's Farce,</HI> which contains the rehear&s;al of another farce, called The <HI>Plea&s;ures of the Town,</HI> is a thing intended to ridicule the Italian opera. This has always been done with partial &s;ucce&s;s, but whoever attempts to de&s;troy the Temple of Folly will &s;oon &s;ee its votaries mend|ing the depredations, as carefully, though not &s;o laud|ably, as ants repair every innovation upon their ne&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="47"><HI>Tom Thumb</HI> is at this moment well known. Its humour is in the true&s;t &s;tyle of burle&s;que. The <HI>Coffee Hou&s;e Politicians</HI> was performed at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, and had good &s;ucce&s;s. It is however greatly inferior to the generality of this author's dramatic works. The <HI>Letter Writers</HI> had much about the &s;ame &s;ate and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame preten&s;ions. FIELDING's five act pieces have al|ways &s;omething good but always want con&s;equence. The <HI>Welch Opera,</HI> which was afterwards called The <HI>Grub Street Opera,</HI> is by no means a good piece; &s;ome of the ballads are &s;prightly, but upon the whole it is a &s;trange jumble.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lottery</HI> is a very plea&s;ant ballad farce. In|deed there are very few of FIELDING's after pieces that are not very entertaining. The <HI>Modern Hu&s;band,</HI> 1734, was a found written comedy, but it was not &s;ufficiently ballanced by either plea&s;antry or intere&s;t. The <HI>Mock Doctor,</HI> taken from MOLIERE's <HI>Medicin Magre lui,</HI> has been always a &s;ucce&s;sful favourite. FIELDING's genius &s;eems to have a kindred feeling with that of MOLIERE; the humour however of both, though perfectly cha&s;te and natural, had &s;ome|thing too &s;aturnine, &s;omething too much of CER|VANTES, for general broad laugh, an ingredient con&s;idered &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in farces.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="48">The <HI>Debauchees</HI> was levelled at the Je&s;uits, and to good purpo&s;e; but one &s;pecies of religious hy|pocricy is like another, and FIELDING was a good deal fore&s;talled by DRYDEN's <HI>Spani&s;h Friar,</HI> and CIBBER's <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> there is neverthele&s;s con&s;idera|ble merit in the piece. The <HI>Covent Garden Tragedy</HI> is a burle&s;que on the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother,</HI> but the cha|racters are too low, being compo&s;ed of bawds, bul|lies, and others of that de&s;cription. It has neverthe|le&s;s con&s;iderable humour. The <HI>Mi&s;er</HI> is certainly the mo&s;t valuable of FIELDING's plays; it is MO|LIERE's <HI>Avare</HI> but greatly improved. It is cha&s;te, proper, and full of nature; and, would &s;ome of our modern playwrights in this age of equivoque look at the &s;cenes of coincidence in that comedy, it might be no bad hint to correct that mon&s;trous a&s;&s;em|blage of unnatural and incongruous circum&s;tances that &s;eem now to be received as the criterion of comic writing, or rather of comic plotting. Every real well wi&s;her to the intere&s;t and con&s;equence of the &s;tage mu&s;t grieve to &s;ee this valuable play cut down to a farce, and performed by the mo&s;t indif|ferent actors in the theatre.</P>
<P>The <HI>Intriguing Chambermaid,</HI> 1733, is an admira|ble farce. It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure taken from the <HI>Di&s;&s;ipateur</HI> of DESTOUCHES, a piece with which &s;everal authors have made pretty free. <HI>Don Quioxte</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="49">
<HI>in England</HI> is, what one mu&s;t naturally &s;uppo&s;e, well written, for whoever copied CERVANTES &s;o faithfully as FIELDING, and ill calculated for the &s;tage, becau&s;e mere knight errantry without &s;pecta|cle never yet had &s;ucce&s;s upon the Engli&s;h theatre. If he had carried <HI>Don Quixote</HI> to any other part of the world and have introduced a few elephants, or camels, and made him fight half a dozen tygers, and have decorated the &s;tage with ca&s;tles that lo&s;e their battlements in the air, about fifteen feet from the ground, the whole an outrage upon nature, and art, the redoubted knight, as mad as his audiences, might have acted every &s;pecies of extravagance to the admiration of full hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The <HI>Virgin Unma&s;ked,</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;s Lucy in Town,</HI> which is the &s;equel to it, are plea&s;ant pieces, and claim a place among the Hoydens, Notables, Prues, and Corinnas; which, by being always in nature, give con&s;tant plea&s;ure. <HI>Pa&s;quin</HI> and all the con&s;equences of its being performed we have already gone over as well as the <HI>Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter. Euridice</HI> was damned, and <HI>Euridice hi&s;&s;ed</HI> its &s;equel, met with and de&s;erved the &s;ame fate, for an apology for a bad piece, when an author could have pro|duced a good one, is an in&s;ult and ought not to be admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"><HI>Tumble Down Dick</HI> was a &s;atire upon RICH's Pantomimes, a u&s;ele&s;s one, becau&s;e nobody cared about the propriety of pantomimes &s;o they had enough of Harlequin and Colombine. <HI>Plutus</HI> was tran&s;lated from ARISTOPHANES by FIELDING and YOUNG. It was never performed. The <HI>Wed|ding Day,</HI> acted in 1743, is a comedy which met with very little &s;ucce&s;s, and indeed de&s;erved very little. It was the la&s;t of FIELDING's pieces; who had he lived in ea&s;e and tranquility would certainly have written better for the &s;tage, for it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that he did not know every dramatic re|qui&s;ite, and no man has given more abundant proof of being a complete judge of character, of effect, and of human nature.</P>
<P>AARON HILL, who &s;eems to have fagged him&s;elf into learning, if not into genius; who did the ta&s;k of the noble dunces at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, that his mind might have an unu&s;ual portion of exerci&s;e; who, in his thir&s;t after knowledge, followed his rela|tion lord PAGET, to CONSTANTINOPLE, and by this means travelled through EGYPT, PALESTINE, and the greate&s;t part of the Ea&s;t, in company with a well informed tutor; who afterwards became tutor to &s;ir WILLIAM HAMILTON, and acquitted him&s;elf, though little more than a boy, to the &s;atisfaction of
<PB N="45" REF="51">
his pupil's friends; who was the projector of nut oil, of ma&s;ts of &s;hips from Scotch firs, of cultivating GEORGIA, and of pot a&s;h; and who, in &s;hort, as a writer had all the merit due at lea&s;t to indefatigable toil and indu&s;try, was the author of &s;eventeen dra|matic pieces, principally tragedies.</P>
<P><HI>Elfrid,</HI> produced in 1710, was afterwards re|written and brought out in 1731, under the tittle of <HI>Athelwold.</HI> It is an exaggeration of the &s;tory of EL|FRIDA, in which the character of Athelwold is &s;o totally different from the hi&s;tory as to be an object of dete&s;tation in&s;tead of pity; a circum&s;tance that totally de&s;troys the poetical beauty of the fable. Who but &s;uch an author in &s;tilts could have thought of making that character an object of commi&s;eration who is a traytor to his mi&s;tre&s;s, his friend, and his king. The <HI>Walking Statue</HI> was a farce and a very indifferent one. <HI>Trick upon Trick</HI> was again a farce. It was damned on the fir&s;t night.</P>
<P><HI>Rinaldo</HI> was the celebrated opera compo&s;ed by HANDEL. We have &s;een that it was written by HILL in Engli&s;h, and tran&s;lated into Italian by ROSSI, the BADINI of that day. The <HI>Fatal Vi&s;ion</HI> was a tragedy, and performed in 1716. The &s;econd title of The <HI>Fate of Siam</HI> is fictitious and intended
<PB N="46" REF="52">
only to give the appearance of truth to enforce the facts, which are wholly invention. It is written to reprobate ra&s;hne&s;s; a kind of Lear in water colours. <HI>Henry the Fifth</HI> is a hi&s;torical play, imitated from SHAKESPEAR. There is &s;ome merit in it, and the introduction of lord Scrope's niece, who had been &s;educed by Henry, and yet who di&s;covers the plot upon his life, is intere&s;ting; but nobody wi&s;hes to &s;ee SHAKESPAR's plays altered, &s;ince it is &s;o diffi|cult for alteration to amend them.</P>
<P><HI>Zara</HI> was performed in 1735. In this tragedy, which is taken from VOLTAIRE, and upon the whole is his be&s;t play, if not the be&s;t play upon the French theatre, HILL has gone &s;o infinitely beyond all his other productions, that, in point of the true requi&s;ites of tragedy, it is almo&s;t the mo&s;t perfect al&s;o on the Engli&s;h &s;tage. It con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;imple, intere&s;ting, and unembarra&s;&s;ed &s;tory; and, being written at that time when VOLTAIRE had &s;till all that glow of patrioti&s;m in his mind which had revolted the minds of his countrymen when he wrote <HI>Brutus,</HI> it was peculiarly adapted to the Engli&s;h &s;tage; &s;o that HILL had that part of the work mo&s;t likely to in&s;ure its popularity ready done to his hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I find an anecdote, in a French hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, re|lative to <HI>Zara,</HI> &s;o &s;ingular; that, though I do not di&s;cover the &s;malle&s;t trace of it in all the Engli&s;h materials I have collected, I cannot refrain from relating it; e&s;pecially as time, place, and circum|&s;tances, very &s;trongly combine to give it fea&s;ibility. An Engli&s;h gen|tleman, named BOND, being delighted with the <HI>Zaire</HI> of VOLTAIRE, employed a poet of reputation to tran&s;late it into Engli&s;h, and en|deavoured to get it performed at Drury Lane theatre, but to no pur|po&s;e. He therefore determined to get it repre&s;ented privately among his friends, and cho&s;e the part of Lu&s;ignan for him&s;elf. It was performed in a concert room, in York Buildings. Neither pains nor expence was &s;pared to render the performance re&s;pectable, and the a&s;&s;embly was numerous and elegant. The applau&s;e was uni|ver&s;al and well merited, but that be&s;towed on Mr. BOND was much louder and more &s;incere than all the re&s;t together. His acting was con&s;idered as a prodigy, and he yielded him&s;elf up &s;o to the force and impetuo&s;ity of his imagination, that, on the di&s;covery of his daughter, he fainted away. Here the applau&s;e was redoubled; but, finding that he continued a long time in that &s;ituation, the audience began, they knew not why, to be unea&s;y and apprehen&s;ive. With &s;ome difficulty, Chatillon and Nere&s;tan, placed him in his chair, when he &s;aintly &s;poke, extended his arms to receive his children, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and then clo&s;ed them for ever.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53">It is remarkable that <HI>Zara,</HI> both in FRANCE and in ENGLAND, had the adventitious advantage of being greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted at its fir&s;t repre&s;entation; for as on the French &s;tage, as I have already mentioned, it brought forward DUFRESNE, and Mademoi&s;elle GAUSSIN, &s;o on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, a near relation of HILL performed O&s;man, and Mrs. CIBBER made her fir&s;t appearance on the theatre in Zara.</P>
<P><HI>Alvira,</HI> 1736, was al&s;o a tran&s;lation from VOL|TAIRE;
<PB N="48" REF="54">
but, though it is well written, it did not as we have &s;een &s;ucceed greatly in FRANCE. The truth is, it was too much after their own model in point of &s;tage regularity, and too full of declamation, which HILL has unfortunately rendered duller than in the original. In FRANCE envy attributed it to &s;ome &s;cribbler from whom it was &s;aid VOLTAIRE &s;tole it, in ENGLAND it excited no envy, and there|fore HILL was permitted quietly to keep it to him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. CHARLES JOHNSON, HUGHES, THOMSON, THEO. BALD, SAVAGE, LILLO, AND OTHER AUTHORS.</HEAD>
<P>I AM now compelled to give the account of other authors, before GARRICK, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall neverthele&s;s mark as &s;trongly as my limits will permit me the mo&s;t prominent features of their re|&s;pective works; and, though I cannot dwell parti|cularly on all the circum&s;tances that attended their &s;ucce&s;s, I &s;hall endeavour to place every author in as con&s;picuous a &s;ituation as his public reception en|titled him to.</P>
<P>CHARLES JOHNSON, who, as we are told, was famous for writing a play every year, and being at BUTTON's every day, mu&s;t, according to this calcu|lation, have been before the public nineteen years; for he produced that number of dramatic pieces; the fact is, however, that he took one and thirty years to accompli&s;h that ta&s;k. His fir&s;t piece, The
<PB N="50" REF="56">
<HI>Gentleman Cully,</HI> came out in 1702. It is only at|tributed to JOHNSON by COXETER, but it is no matter who was the author of it, for it has very little merit.</P>
<P><HI>Fortune in her Wits,</HI> 1705. This is a bad tran&s;la|tion of COWLEY's <HI>Naufragium Joculare.</HI> It was not performed. <HI>Love and Liberty,</HI> a tragedy, was in|tended for Drury Lane theatre. It is dedicated to the judicious critics throughout the town, who had, however, no proper opportunity of judging of its merits for it was never performed. The <HI>Force of Friend&s;hip</HI> was a tragedy, and the fir&s;t play poor JOHNSON could get on the &s;tage. It however might as well have been kept off, for it was com|pletely damned as well as an after piece, called <HI>Love in a Che&s;t</HI> which accompanied it; &s;o that, as far as we have gone, JOHNSON's labour was labour in vain.</P>
<P>JOHNSON, having hitherto &s;ound very few dra|matic materials in him&s;elf, thought it would be a wi&s;er way to have recour&s;e to others. His next play called The <HI>Wi&s;e's Relief,</HI> is borrowed from SHIRLEY's <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> and had &s;ucce&s;s. Its principal merits, however, we have gone over in the account of SHIRLEY. It was produced in 1712, The <HI>Suc|ce&s;sful</HI>

<HI>Pirate,</HI> 1713. JOHNSON next paid a vi&s;it to CARLELL, from whom he &s;tole the be&s;t materials he could in <HI>Arviragus and Philicia</HI>; but the original was bad, and the copy wor&s;e. The <HI>Generous Hu&s;band</HI> was borrowed from nobody, and therefore had no &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Victim,</HI> 1714. JOHNSON is charged with having borrowed this play from BOYER's <HI>Achilles,</HI> and RACINE's <HI>Iphigenie.</HI> It was time mi&s;|applied however, and &s;o the public thought.</P>
<P>The <HI>Country La&s;&s;es</HI> was a more fortunate bu&s;i|ne&s;s; for, in order to make a&s;&s;urance double &s;ure, it is as I formerly noticed taken from three plays, which had been in part taken from others. It has been at times revived with &s;ucce&s;s, and KENRICK fa&s;hioned it into an opera which was performed at Covent Garden theatre. Upon this occa&s;ion the mu|&s;ician, who&s;e name appeared in the bills as the com|po&s;er, was determined to convince the public that he under&s;tood thieving as well as the original au|thor of the piece.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cobler of Pre&s;ton,</HI> which is taken from SHAKESPEAR, was thought &s;o well of before it made its appearance that BULLOCK, the actor wrote a piece upon the &s;ame &s;ubject which was begun and fini&s;hed in four and twenty hours, in order to get the
<PB N="52" REF="58">
&s;tart of the other; but if they had been both burnt before they had made their appearance it would have been no great matter. The <HI>Sultane&s;s</HI> is a tran&s;|lation of RACINE's <HI>Bazajet,</HI> which is his wor&s;t play, and we find it here le&s;s con&s;iderable than the original. It was performed in 1717, and &s;ome how or other procured JOHNSON a corner in the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ma&s;querade</HI> was an in&s;ignificant thing, en|tirely invented by JOHNSON. <HI>Love in a Fore&s;t</HI> is neither more nor le&s;s than SHAKESPEAR's <HI>As You Like It,</HI> mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly mangled and di&s;figured. It would in&s;ult the reader to notice its &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Female Fortune Teller.</HI> This play is only attributed to JOHNSON. It is not very material, however, for it has not merit enough to help even his fame. The <HI>Village Opera</HI> is very poorly written, and had but in|different &s;ucce&s;s. It furni&s;hed the hint, however, of <HI>Love in a Village,</HI> which is made up of this play, The <HI>Gentleman Dancing Ma&s;ter, Le Jeu de L'amour et du Hazard</HI> of MARIVAUX, and two or three other things.</P>
<P>With The <HI>Ephe&s;ian Matron,</HI> a farce of one act, <HI>Medea,</HI> a tragedy, only attributed to him, and bad enough to have belonged to a wor&s;e author, and <HI>Coelia, or the Perjured Lover,</HI> we fini&s;h the plays of

In that tragedy, however, there is enough of the poet and enough of the dramati&s;t to &s;hew that, had he thought proper to bend his talents more towards the &s;tage, he would have &s;tood very high as a theatrical writer. ADDISON had &s;uch an opinion of him that he entreated him, out of de&s;pair, as he &s;aid, of his own powers, to write a fifth act to <HI>Cato</HI>; but the jealou&s;y of the Dramatic Tartu&s;&s;e made him &s;oon re|pent of his reque&s;t, and before HUGHES had fini&s;hed it he took care to write one him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HUGHES, as well as a poet, was a mu&s;ician, and a painter, and of no mean de&s;cription; but he &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the two la&s;t accompli&s;hments more as an amateur than a ma&s;ter.

<P>The fir&s;t play of THOMSON was <HI>Sophoni&s;ba</HI>; a &s;ubject we have &s;een repeatedly treated. It came out in 1730. At the time he was writing it, he had publi&s;hed <HI>Winter,</HI> which was written into fame, though it had merit, before it was known whether it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any at all. The public expectation, there|fore, was a tip toe for this his fir&s;t dramatic produc|tion, and the rehear&s;als were crouded by an a&s;&s;em|blage of all that was fa&s;hionable about town. This anticipation of its public reception, however, only foretold that its real effect would not be reputable. It was con&s;idered as a dull moral performance, and one &s;ingle line gave a ludicrous opportunity to turn it into a je&s;t; a &s;ymptom generally fatal to tragedy.</P>
<P>This line was parodied in FIELDING's <HI>Tom Thumb.</HI> In THOMSON's play it was,
<Q><L>Oh, Sophoni&s;ba, Sophoni&s;ba, oh!</L></Q></P>
<P>In FIELDING's &s;arce it was,

If every tragedy were to be laid a&s;ide for a non&s;en&s;ical line, I am afraid there would be but little employ for MELPOMENE.</P>
<P><HI>Agamemnon,</HI> a tragedy, was performed in 1738, and had every a&s;&s;i&s;tance from THOMSON's friends, and among the re&s;t, POPE, affecting to patronize it, placed him&s;elf very forward in the theatre during its repre&s;entation. The good people of ENGLAND, however, like to feel for them&s;elves, and could not be taught to find any merit in it.</P>
<P><HI>Edward and Eleonora</HI> was prepared for the &s;tage, but interdicted by the Lord Chamberlain, &s;ome &s;ay by the connivance of the author, who feared its pub|lic fate; but this is a very improbable &s;tory. The hi&s;tory of the play is well known, or rather well be|lieved. It is the circum&s;tance of ELEONORA, queen to EDWARD the fir&s;t, who is &s;aid to have cured her hu&s;band by &s;ucking the venom from a wound he received from a poi&s;oned arrow.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ma&s;que of Alfred,</HI> written in conjunction with MALLET, &s;o beautifully compo&s;ed by ARNE, and of which every body knows the &s;ucce&s;s, is the la&s;t of THOMSON's dramatic performances before

<P>THEOBALD&mdash;who&s;e edition of SHAKESPEAR's works was preferred to the editions of POPE, WAR|BURTON, and HANMER, and with rea&s;on; becau&s;e, however he might have been <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a heavy minded man,"</Q> it had that &s;ort of merit for which ADDISON pre|ferred TICKLER's <HI>Homer</HI> to POPE's, that is to &s;ay, more of SHAKESPEAR in it, and indeed more hone&s;t inclination to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject it treated&mdash;has very little el&s;e to be remembered by. He wrote eighteen dramatic pieces of one de&s;cription or other which I &s;hall now de&s;cribe. I am &s;orry to &s;ay that ju&s;tice will not let me &s;peak their eulogium.</P>
<P><HI>Electra,</HI> 1714, was a mere tran&s;lation from SO|PHOCLES. The <HI>Per&s;ian Prince&s;s,</HI> 1715, was written, according to the author's account, before he was nineteen. This is one rea&s;on, perhaps, that it is &s;o full of puerility. The <HI>Perfidious Brother,</HI> 1715, is the <HI>Orphan</HI> &s;poilt. Another man, a watch maker of the name of MESTAYER, &s;ays that THEOBALD &s;tole this play from one written by him on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject. <HI>Oedipus, King of Thebes,</HI> is a tran&s;lation from
<PB N="59" REF="65">
SOPHOCLES, with critical notes, and a heavy bu&s;ine&s;s it is. <HI>Plutus,</HI> and The <HI>Clouds,</HI> are of cour&s;e from ARISTOPHANES. None of the&s;e Greek tragedies and comedies were intended for the &s;tage.</P>
<P><HI>Pan and Syrinx</HI> was an opera &s;et to mu&s;ic by GALLIARD, who was a &s;prightly compo&s;er with con|&s;iderable genius. This piece had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. In the <HI>Lady's Triumph,</HI> a piece written by SETTLE, THEOBALD introduced &s;ome epi&s;odic parts which were &s;et to mu&s;ic. <HI>Richard the Second,</HI> altered from SHAKESPEAR, had &s;ucce&s;s. Lord ORRERY made THEOBALD a pre&s;ent upon this occa&s;ion of a hun|dred pounds enclo&s;ed in a &s;nuff box worth twenty. The <HI>Rape of Pro&s;erpine, Apollo and Daphne,</HI> and <HI>Harlequin Sorcerer,</HI> were the next productions of this author. The&s;e pantomimes are well known, though they do more credit to the machine&s;t and mu&s;ician than the author; &s;ome of the mu&s;ic of the <HI>Sorcerer,</HI> was compo&s;ed, and in a very fine &s;tyle, by Dr. ARNE, the re&s;t and all that remains of the original is by GALLIARD.</P>
<P>The <HI>Double Fal&s;ehood,</HI> 1727, THEOBALD endea|voured to palm on the world for a production of SHAKESPEAR, probably becau&s;e he wi&s;hed the brat to have a good father. Dr. FARMER &s;ays it was
<PB N="60" REF="66">
by SHIRLEY, and Mr. MALONE gives it to MAS|SINGER It is generally however believed to be THEOBALD's and thus the&s;e reports compo&s;e a triple fal&s;ehood. The proverb of too many cooks &s;poil the broth was here rever&s;ed, for the play had very good &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> 1731. Why this piece is called an opera it is difficult to &s;ay; perhaps be|cau&s;e the &s;ubject is romantic, and it is inter&s;per&s;ed with a little mu&s;ic. It is a &s;trange thing and the public were of that opinion. The <HI>Fatal Secret</HI> was k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters"> to every body before it came out, for it is &s;tolen from WEBSTER's <HI>Duche&s;s of Malfy.

The <HI>Happy Captive</HI> is the la&s;t of THEO|BALD's pieces and intended to ridicule the Italian opera. It is however &s;o ridiculous it&s;elf that it re|coiled and wounded its author.</P>
<P>SAVAGE, who&s;e &s;trange turbulent life has been &s;o laboriou&s;ly written by Dr. JOHNSON, had how|ever very little either in that or his writings to command public applau&s;e. If he had an unnatural mother, he was him&s;elf unnatural and ungrateful to|wards all his brothers and &s;i&s;ters of creation, for he never enjoyed the bounty or friend&s;hip of any indi|vidual whom he did not offend and incence, which is &s;o well known by tho&s;e who have read the long ca|talogue
<PB N="61" REF="67">
of his &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes that it is unnec|ce&s;&s;ary if it were not impo&s;&s;ible to go into it here.</P>
<P>SAVAGE's dramatic works are <HI>Love in a Veil,</HI> a comedy, and <HI>Sir Thomas Overbury,</HI> a tragedy. The fir&s;t, though brought out under the advantage of the kinde&s;t attention from WILKS and STEELE, which he returned as u&s;ual with ingratitude, had no &s;uc|ce&s;s; the other was &s;paringly prai&s;ed. It yielded altogether from the theatre and the pre&s;s &s;ome &s;ay two hundred pounds, &s;ome only one.</P>
<P>LILLO, the celebrated author of <HI>George Barn|well,</HI> was an original Engli&s;h writer of great merit. It is impo&s;&s;ible to deny that dome&s;tic &s;ubjects are be&s;t treated in natural and unaffected language, and derive mo&s;t pathos and intere&s;t from forcible pro&s;e than mea&s;ured blank ver&s;e. The heart knows no|thing of heroics; it cannot feign; it cannot be de|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;hocked, or torne, rai&s;ed, intere&s;ted, or de|lighted, &s;o well by any language as that which utters ideas expre&s;&s;ive of naked and in&s;tant con|ception. All &s;ublimity is &s;imple; and, if no author has hit it oftner than SHAKESPEAR, it is becau&s;e his ver&s;e has all the force and fidelity of pro&s;e.</P>
<P>LILLO's fir&s;t piece was <HI>Silvia, or the Country</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="68">
<HI>Burial.</HI> It was an opera, and was performed in 1731, at which time nothing of this de&s;cription could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed owing to the great reputation of the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that its own fair pretentions to public favour were very &s;lender,</P>
<P><HI>George Barnwell</HI> is &s;o well known that it is diffi|cult to make any addition to what has been already &s;aid of it. Dr. JOHNSON has declared that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;carcely thinks a tragedy in pro&s;e dramatic; that it is difficult for performers to &s;peak it; that the lowe&s;t when impa&s;&s;ioned rai&s;e their language,"</Q>
I think he had better have &s;aid their voices, for as to their language I believe upon &s;uch occa&s;ions it is lowered even to blackguardi&s;m,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and that the writing of pro&s;e is generally the plea or excu&s;e of poverty of genius."</Q></P>
<P>LILLO has very plainly given the lie to all this in <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> a play that would have lo&s;t all its pathos had it been in blank ver&s;e; and this fact is &s;o &s;trongly proved that, if it had not boa&s;ted &s;ter|ling and valuable merit to a mo&s;t uncommon de|gree, it mu&s;t have &s;unk under the weight of that calumny which was intended to cru&s;h it; but &s;ays an author tho&s;e auditors who brought with them the
<PB N="63" REF="69">
old ballad, from which the play was taken, with a view to ridicule and decry it, were at length ob|liged to drop their ballads and pull out their hand|kerchiefs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chri&s;tian Hero</HI> is taken from SCANDERBEG and is by no means a proper &s;ubject either for the &s;tage or for LILLO. <HI>Fatal Curio&s;ity</HI> is however pro|per for both, for it is certainly very intere&s;ting and admirably well treated. There is a mixture of horror and tenderne&s;s in it which in a very uncom|mon degree penetrate the heart. The &s;tory, though the circum&s;tance really happened, is extremely novel, and the moral is grand and commanding. There &s;eems nothing again&s;t us &s;ucce&s;s, were it to be re|vived, but its length, for it is in three acts, and even a good author would tremble at an attempt to ex|tend it to five. <HI>Marina,</HI> a play of three acts, is taken from PERICLES. <HI>Britannia</HI> is a ma&s;que written on the marriage of the Prince&s;s of ORANGE and the Prince&s;s Royal.</P>
<P><HI>Elmeric</HI> was a po&s;thumous work of LILLO. It did no particular credit to his reputation. <HI>Arden of of Fever&s;ham</HI> was left in an imperfect &s;tate, but it was fini&s;hed by Dr. HOADLY, and brought out with &s;ucce&s;s in 1759. This play is written upon the
<PB N="64" REF="70">
old &s;tory from which a tragedy had before been made. It was fal&s;ely imputed to SHAKESPEAR, and introduced by the following title. <HI>The lamentable and true tragedie of M. Arden of Fever&s;ham, in Kent, who was mo&s;t wickedlye murdered by the means of his di&s;loyall and wanton wy&s;e; who, for the love &s;he bare for one Mo&s;bie, hyred two de&s;perate ruffins, Blackwill and Shagbag, to kill him.</HI></P>
<P>CHARLES SHADWELL, nephew, or as &s;ome &s;ay &s;on, to the laureat whom DRYDEN has immortalized by his <HI>Mac Flecknoe,</HI> enjoyed &s;ome public po&s;t in IRELAND, and wrote &s;even dramatic productions, all which, except one, The <HI>Fair Quaker of Deal,</HI> an account of which and Mi&s;s SANTLOW's celebrity we have &s;een, were performed on the Iri&s;h &s;tage. They were called The <HI>Humours of the Army,</HI> The <HI>Ha&s;ty Wedding, Sham Prince, Rotheric O'Connor, Plotting Lovers,</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h Ho&s;pitality.</HI> In all the&s;e pieces SHADWELL has &s;tudied DANCOURT, taking up &s;uch &s;light flimzy circum&s;tances as might form temporary exhibitions. The <HI>Humours of the Army</HI> is exactly <HI>Les Curieux de Compeigne.</HI></P>
<P>TAVERNER was a name a good deal di&s;tingui&s;hed in various branches of the arts. The pre&s;ent object of our notice practi&s;ed the civil law in Doctor's
<PB N="65" REF="71">
Commons, and painted and wrote plays for his amu&s;ement, and certainly in no mean degree for the amu&s;ement of the public. He, however, painted better than he wrote. The titles of his plays are The <HI>Faithful Bride of Grenada,</HI> The <HI>Maid the Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> The <HI>Female Advocates,</HI> The <HI>Artful Hu&s;band,</HI> The <HI>Artful Wife,</HI> and <HI>'Tis Well if it Takes.</HI></P>
<P>SWINEY, who&s;e hi&s;tory has been already pretty well traced, wrote The <HI>Quacks, Camilla,</HI> and <HI>Pyrrhus and Demetrius.</HI> The fir&s;t is a poor farce and the others were done in quality of Operatical Manager. WARD was a whim&s;ical fellow of &s;trong natural parts; who, finding that he could breathe no at|mo&s;phere but that of an alehou&s;e, re&s;olved to keep one him&s;elf. He was by no means a bad writer, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a mock heroic poem in the &s;tyle of Hudibras, called The <HI>Reformation.</HI> His dramatic pieces are <HI>Hone&s;ty in Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> The <HI>Humours of a Coffee Hou&s;e,</HI> and The <HI>Pri&s;oners Opera.</HI> There was another WARD who wrote The <HI>Happy Lovers,</HI> The <HI>Petticoat Plotter,</HI> and The <HI>Widow's Wi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>PHILIPS, who was one of the &s;atelites that moved about ADDISON, and who&s;e <HI>Sappho</HI> is thought by &s;ome to be worth all the re&s;t of his works, his pa&s;to|rals
<PB N="66" REF="72">
and his tragedy included, even though he is &s;up|po&s;ed to be greatly indebted to his friends for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in it, and who&s;e <HI>Namby Pamby</HI> is &s;aid by a great man to have delighted all ranks, from a WAL|POLE, the &s;teerer of the helm, to Mi&s;s PULTENEY in her nur&s;ery, wrote for the &s;tage The <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother,</HI> The <HI>Briton,</HI> and <HI>Humphrey Duke of Glouce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mother</HI> is completely from the <HI>Andromacque</HI> of RACINE. It was puffed into re|putation by ADDISON and all his friends, and cer|tainly has a degree of merit. The perpetual &s;ee|&s;aw however of intere&s;t being divided between four characters, who relieve one another like centinels, or buckets in a well, is intolerably tedious. I once &s;aw it acted by four performers, each of whom had a different li&s;p. The <HI>Briton</HI> was brought out in 1721. It was well received, but has been ever &s;ince neglected. <HI>Humphrey,</HI> as good a de&s;ignation of a Briton as the other, was not &s;o well received.</P>
<P>OZEL was little more than an indu&s;trious tran&s;la|tor. His pieces are principally tran&s;lations from MOLIERE, who&s;e whole works he has given the public, CORNEILLE, RACINE, and others; and, as he thus occupied him&s;elf for amu&s;ement rather than emolument, being employed in bu&s;ine&s;s very
<PB N="67" REF="73">
lucratively and re&s;pectably, his pieces were little adapted for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>CAREY, the well known writer of &s;everal farces which occa&s;ionally are now revived with plea&s;ure, was by profe&s;&s;ion a mu&s;ician. He had &s;ome genius but little ta&s;te. There is &s;carcely any thing of his however but has &s;omething like merit, though not actually the thing it&s;elf.

<P><HI>Harging and Marriage</HI> was never acted. The <HI>Contrivances</HI> has been acted and very frequently with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. Everybody knows that <HI>Arethu&s;a</HI> u&s;ed to be the probationary part of female &s;ingers before they were bold enough to venture upon characters of more con&s;equence, a mode of
<PB N="68" REF="74">
conduct which would be more &s;erviceable to the &s;tage than beginning as is u&s;ual now, with &s;tepping on the top round of the ladder, a circum&s;tance that precludes a&s;&s;cen&s;ion and may produce a fall. <HI>Amelia</HI> after the Italian manner, and produced at the French theatre had no great merit. Here we begin to &s;ee the extent of CAREY's mu&s;ical abilities; for, when|ever the limits of the poetry exceeded mere trifles he was obliged to call in a&s;&s;i&s;tance, LAMPE, a man of con&s;iderable merit, compo&s;ed this opera. <HI>Tera|minta</HI> was a piece of the &s;ame de&s;cription; the mu&s;ic was compo&s;ed by SMITH. I very much &s;u&s;pect that CAREY could do little more than in|vent a melody and get &s;ome other per&s;on to tran&s;mit his ideas from his mind to paper, or at lea&s;t the arrangement of it; not &s;o bad but &s;omething like the lady compo&s;ers of the pre&s;ent day, and indeed the gentlemen too in &s;ome ca&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Chrononhotonthologos</HI> is a well known burle&s;que in which there are many pa&s;&s;ages that &s;ucce&s;sfully ridicule inflated and bomba&s;tic writing. The idea of the warrior's piling him&s;elf upon dead bodies, till he reached the gods, who invited him for his heroi&s;m to remain with them, which offer he rejected becau&s;e he was &s;ummoned to earth by the eyes of his mi&s;tre&s;s, is very happy. The <HI>Hone&s;t York&s;hireman</HI> is a true
<PB N="69" REF="75">
Engli&s;h farce and has much plea&s;antry. The parts of the mu&s;ic, which are not &s;elected, came very properly within the reach of CAREY's mu&s;ical genius.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dragon of Wantley</HI> has frequently given plea&s;ure on the &s;tage. It is much more the right &s;ort of burle&s;que on Italian operas than the gene|rality of pieces written upon that principle. The terror excited in the old ballad by the dragon and the &s;uperiority of MOORE, of MOOREHALL, to either Hercules or St. George, are admirable materials for the purpo&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"for,"</Q> &s;ays the ballad, &s;peaking of Hercules and the Dragon of Lerna,

<P>BULLOCK, &s;on to the celebrated actor of that name, was him&s;elf an actor and a dramatic writer; but he fell &s;hort of his father in one profe&s;&s;ion, and of his cotemporaries in the other. His pieces are as follows: <HI>Woman's Revenge,</HI> a comedy, 1715, is a filtration of BETTERTON's <HI>Match in Newgate,</HI> which he had filtrated from MARSTON's <HI>Dutch Courtezan</HI>; The <HI>Slip</HI> merits its name for it is no more than a cion from MIDDLETON's <HI>Mad World my Ma&s;ters. Adventures of Half an Hour</HI> was &s;carcely &s;uffered by the audience half that time. The <HI>Cobler of Pre&s;ton</HI> we have already &s;een an account of in the article, <HI>Charles John&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Perjuror</HI> is a very poor thing. It &s;eems in|tended to reprobate the con&s;tant breach of official oaths, and to &s;trike at trading ju&s;tices, con&s;tables, and their under&s;trappers; but &s;uch characters are too callous to be hurt by &s;o tiny a club. BULLOCK &s;eems to have acted the Hercules with a &s;witch in his hand. <HI>Woman's a Riddle</HI> was claimed by SAVAGE and brought out by BULLOCK, but is nothing more than a tran&s;lation of a Spani&s;h play by a lady. The <HI>Traytor,</HI> 1718. If BULLOCK's attempts in comedy
<PB N="71" REF="77">
were &s;o ineffectual, this &s;ingle effort of tragedy mu&s;t be of cour&s;e ten times wor&s;e. This <HI>Traytor,</HI> which has been al&s;o attributed to SHIRLEY and to RI|VERS, betrayed BULLOCK into the folly of con|firming the town in their opinion that he had very poor preten&s;ions as a dramatic writer.</P>
<P>THEOPHILUS CIBBER, who&s;e variegated and complicate hi&s;tory was as &s;candalous, and would have been as noticeable, as that of SAVAGE, if he had been born with as much genius, who was for|ward in all manner of theatrical &s;chi&s;ms, and got into all manner of &s;crapes, who has been con&s;idered by GOLDSMITH and others to have fortunately e&s;|caped hanging by being drowned, who, in &s;hort, was a con&s;tant impo&s;ition in every thing he &s;aid and did, all which is attributed by an author to his having been born on the day of the mo&s;t memorable &s;torm ever known in this kingdom, which happened No|vember 26th, 1703, brought out, for we cannot &s;ay he wrote, &s;ix dramatic pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">T. CIBBER was allowed by the world to claim &s;ome &s;hare of reputation from the work, publi&s;hed in five volumes, and called <HI>Cibber's Lives of the Poets,</HI> but JOHNSON upon indubitable authority, no le&s;s than having the original manu&s;cript in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in&s;i&s;ts that CIBBER had no hand in it whatever, for that it was the work of ROBERT SHIELS, a native of Scotland, to whom he pays &s;ome hand&s;ome compliments. There is one matter rather irreconcileable in this account, for JOHNSON &s;ays that this work was never &s;een by either of the CIBBERS, and yet he informs the reader that CIBBER betrayed the name of the author for ten guineas. This is a curious circum&s;tance altogether. CIBBER publi&s;hed the work as his own; he mu&s;t, therefore, not only have &s;een it but have purcha&s;ed it of SHIELS, and a promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy along with it, which &s;ecrecy mu&s;t have been kept by SHIELS inviolably till his death, which happened, as JOHNSON tells us, ju&s;t after the work was publi&s;hed. How came JOHNSON to know this fact? Does he mean to &s;ay it was to him that CIBBER betrayed the &s;ecret for ten guineas? Or, what is more un|likely, did he know SHIELS and his hand writing? And by that means was able to a&s;certain that the manu&s;cript in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was written by SHIELS? Really this bare a&s;&s;ertion, contradicting it&s;elf &s;o many ways, is very que&s;tionable.</NOTE>.

<HI>Henry the Sixth,</HI> a mi&s;erable alteration of SHAKE|SPEAR's play, was performed only in the &s;ummer and received very little applau&s;e, but yet more than it merited. The <HI>Lover,</HI> which play he dedicated to his wife, who&s;e acting gave it the little celebrity it obtained, was a flimzy piece full of common place and puerility. <HI>Patie and Peggy,</HI> is ALLEN RAM|SEY's <HI>Gentle Shepherd</HI> reduced to one act. CIBBER boa&s;ts that he atchieved this mighty ta&s;k in one day, which he might ea&s;ily do, pen and ink being totally out of the que&s;tion, and nothing more being ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the labour of this memorable playwright than pa&s;te and a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars.

<P>COFFEY, an Iri&s;hman, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an inexhau&s;table fund of that humour that di&s;tingui&s;hes the low Iri&s;h, who had a knack of patching up old plays and farces, and who performed Ae&s;op for his benefit merely becau&s;e he was deformed, for he was an execrable actor, brought out <HI>Southwark Fair,</HI> a droll, taken from an old play, The <HI>Beggar's Wedding,</HI> made up from the <HI>Jovial Crew</HI> and other things, <HI>Phoebe,</HI> the &s;ame piece cut into a farce, The <HI>Female Par&s;on,</HI> which was damned the fir&s;t night, The <HI>Devil to Pay, or the Wives Metamorpho&s;ed,</HI> a well known and ju&s;tly admired farce, not however written by COFFEY but metamorpho&s;ed by him, MOTTLEY, the two CIBBERS, and others, from SHADWELL's <HI>Devil of a Wife,</HI> The <HI>Boarding School,</HI> taken from a mi&s;erable play of DURFEY, The <HI>Merry Cobler,</HI> a &s;equel to the <HI>Devil to Pay,</HI> and damned the fir&s;t night, and The <HI>Devil upon two Sticks,</HI> &s;tolen from an indifferent play written by one GWINNET.</P>
<P>MOTTLEY derived more con&s;ideration from his
<PB N="74" REF="80">
being a man of family, and &s;ome fortune, than by his dramatic efforts. The <HI>Imperial Captives,</HI> a tra|gedy, 1720, merely a pa&s;&s;able production, was per|formed for a few nights with that negative &s;ort of &s;ucce&s;s which to an author of any &s;pirit, is more than a po&s;itive damnation. <HI>Antiochus</HI> is founded on the &s;trange improbable, or if probable the unnatural &s;tory of Seleucas Nicanor, who gave up his wife Stratonice to his &s;on Antiochus, who was dying for love of her. That folly which is a &s;atire on the pa&s;&s;ions in&s;tead of a compliment to them ought not to be made a &s;ubject of the drama. This would be a good theme for KOTZEBUE.</P>
<P><HI>Penelope,</HI> 1728. This is a burle&s;que of HOMER's <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey.</HI> MOTTLEY was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in it by COOKE.

<HI>Sack,</HI> a poor farce; <HI>Humours of Purgatory,</HI> taken from the comic part of SOUTHERN's <HI>Fatal Marriage,</HI> The <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> a thing that had temporary &s;ucce&s;s. and <HI>Whig and Tory,</HI> which had no &s;ucce&s;s at all.</P>
<P>The remainder of tho&s;e authors before GARRICK, I &s;hall take in a &s;ummary way. HUNT wrote The <HI>Fall of Tarquin,</HI> a mo&s;t wretched piece, &s;ays my intelligence. JACOB was author of The <HI>Poetical Regi&s;ter,</HI> and produced <HI>Love in a Wood,</HI> a farce never performed, and The <HI>Soldier's La&s;t Stake.</HI> This he informs his readers was ready for the &s;tage which of cour&s;e was not ready to receive it, for it never made its appearance. Sir HILDIBRAND JACOB, who wrote poems and other publications, produced The <HI>Fatal Con&s;tancy,</HI> a tragedy, 1723, performed with applau&s;e enough to encourage its author to go on, ju&s;t as we are tempted to play after winning the fir&s;t &s;takes. The <HI>Ne&s;t of Plays</HI> was three come|dies in one. It was damned the fir&s;t night, &s;ome &s;ay becau&s;e it had no merit, and others becau&s;e it was the fir&s;t play brought out after the Licen&s;ing Act; the la&s;t rea&s;on &s;eems non&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mrs HAYWOOD, a mo&s;t whim&s;ical writer, who &s;eemed determined to prove that women cannot not only talk fa&s;ter but write fa&s;ter than men, who&s;e novels, e&s;&s;ays, and other productions of a &s;imilar
<PB N="76" REF="82">
kind, take up nineteen volumes, who took Mrs. MANLFY for her model, who&s;e indecency &s;o of|fended POPE that he clapt her up in the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and who is defended by her biographer becau&s;e, though &s;he wrote indecently at fir&s;t, &s;he wrote de|licately afterwards, from which this charitable ad|vocate &s;uppo&s;es that &s;he was gallant in the early part of her life and afterwards, reformed&mdash;wrote four dramatic pieces, <HI>Fair Captive, Wife to Let, Frederick Duke of Brun&s;wick,</HI> and <HI>Opera of Operas,</HI> which the &s;ame gentleman confe&s;&s;es were but indifferent. The fir&s;t was not written by her but by Captain HURST, the &s;econd did not &s;ucceed, though the lady attempted the principal part, the third was damned, and the fourth was FIELDING's <HI>Tom Thumb</HI> &s;et to mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>SAMUEL JOHNSON, not the lexicographer, but the author of <HI>Hurlothrumbo,</HI> got &s;ome reputation by affecting &s;ingularity; a trick that has too often im|po&s;ed upon the public. He wrote al&s;o <HI>Che&s;hire Comics,</HI> The <HI>Blazing Comet,</HI> and <HI>All alive and Merry.</HI> The&s;e pieces were all repre&s;ented at the Haymarket. The rage for <HI>Hurlothrumbo</HI> was a di&s;grace to the public, for the audience were fairly laughed at all through the piece.</P>
<P>The author hone&s;tly tells them that they will find
<PB N="77" REF="83">
it full of madne&s;s and extravagance, fine thoughts, and unintelligible fu&s;tian and fiction; and thus goes on in a mixed &s;tyle between the <HI>Euphiu&s;m</HI> of LYLLY, and the <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI> of RABELAIS, performing the principal character him&s;elf, and confe&s;&s;ing that it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to under&s;tand him, owing to their not ta&s;ting the different &s;entiments as he did when he compo&s;ed the piece, by &s;ometimes playing on a &s;iddle, and &s;ometimes walking in &s;tilts.</P>
<P>How &s;uch incomprehen&s;ible &s;tupidity cold have been followed with the in&s;atiable avidity it was, challenges a&s;toni&s;hment. The fact however is indubitable. All the world flocked to hear this rhap&s;odical non&s;en&s;e. A &s;et of &s;marts formed them&s;elves into what they called the Hurlothrumbo Society, nay, it is &s;aid that Sir ROBERT WALPOLE encouraged this infatuation to amu&s;e the people while &s;ome &s;tate &s;ecrets were getting properly ripe for di&s;covery.</P>
<P>ESTCOURT, of whom I have already &s;poken of as an actor, brought out The <HI>Fair Example,</HI> a co|medy, and <HI>Prunella,</HI> an interlude; neither of which claim much rank as dramatic pieces. SMITH wrote <HI>Phoedra and Hyppolitus,</HI> 1707. This play was per|formed but three nights, which doctor JOHNSON ac|counts for by &s;aying that it plea&s;ed the critics and the critics only; 'tis true that ADDISON &s;ays the
<PB N="78" REF="84">
neglect of it was di&s;graceful to the nation; but AD|DISON always lavi&s;hed prai&s;es on tho&s;e writers from who&s;e abilities he had nothing to fear.</P>
<P>FYFE, an ob&s;cure author, wrote The <HI>Royal Martyr, King Charles the Fir&s;t.</HI> Governor HUNTER, who took two thou&s;and Palatines to &s;ettle at NEW YORK, and who was at different times governor of NEW YORK, VIRGINIA, the JERSEYS, and JA|MAICA, wrote a thing di&s;tingui&s;hed as a biographical farce, called <HI>Androborus.</HI> Lord BLESSINGTON wrote a contemptible farce called The <HI>Lo&s;t Prince&s;s.</HI> CHARLES, Lord Otrery, was the author of an un&s;ucce&s;sful comedy, the prologue by Lord LANDS|DOWN, called <HI>As you find It.</HI> Dr. KING, known by his &s;iding with SACHEVERAL, by having a hand in the <HI>Examiner,</HI> by writing The <HI>Art of Love</HI> and The <HI>Art of Cookery,</HI> produced a tragi-comedy called <HI>Joan of Headington.</HI> CRIMES, who was a &s;chool|ma&s;ter, and famous for exciting in&s;urrections among his boys, wrote a thing which he called an <HI>Opera alluding to Peace.</HI></P>
<P>The famous Puppet Shew POWELL, rival of the Italian opera, produced a mock performance called <HI>Venus and Adonis.</HI> JACKSON tran&s;lated <HI>Ajax</HI> from SOPHOCLES. BLANCH wrote three pieces, which
<PB N="79" REF="85">
were however not performed; they were called The <HI>Beau Merchant, Swords into Anchors,</HI> and <HI>Hoops into Spinning Wheels.</HI> HAMILTON wrote two mi&s;erable things called <HI>Doating Lovers,</HI> and The <HI>Petticoat Plotter</HI>; the la&s;t of which, however, in con&s;equence of the author's intere&s;t, who was related to the Duke of HAMILTON, procured him a hand&s;ome benefit at advanced prices.</P>
<P>MOLLOY, who was a &s;taunch advocate for go|vernment, and therefore, &s;ays my author, was ne|glected by mini&s;try, wrote The <HI>Perplexed Couple,</HI> The <HI>Coquette,</HI> and The <HI>Half Pay Officers,</HI> neither of which met with any great &s;ucce&s;s &s;ays the &s;ame author, although in one of them an old woman of eighty-five, called PEG FRYER, played a part and danced a jig. Three pieces called The <HI>Earl of Mar marred,</HI> The <HI>Prerender's Flight,</HI> and The <HI>In|qui&s;ition,</HI> are attributed to an author of the name of JOHN PHILIPS, though very uncertain accounts are given of either this author, or the&s;e plays. KNIPE wrote a farce called The <HI>City Ramble.</HI></P>
<P>BRERETON, a major in the army, in two pieces he produced, imitated RACINE's <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> and COR|NEILLE's <HI>Policuete.</HI> BOOTH, the actor, wrote an opera called The <HI>Death of Dido,</HI> which was com|po&s;ed
<PB N="80" REF="86">
by PEPUSCHE. Mrs. DAVYS, an Iri&s;hwoman, and the keeper of a coffee hou&s;e, wrote The <HI>Northern Heire&s;s,</HI> and The <HI>Self Rival</HI>; one only of the&s;e pieces was performed and that had but very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. LEVERIDGE, the &s;inger, wrote <HI>Pyramus and Thi&s;be.</HI> BREVAL wrote The <HI>Confe|derates,</HI> and the <HI>Play is the Plot,</HI> from which pieces were taken, The <HI>Strollers,</HI> and the <HI>Rape of Helen.</HI> The <HI>Confederates</HI> is a &s;atire on <HI>Three Hours after Mar|riage,</HI> which BREVAL publi&s;hed under the a&s;&s;umed name of JOSEPH GAY. This was provocation enough for POPE; who, in&s;tantly introduced BRE|VAL into the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> WEAVER was a dancing ma&s;ter, and a dramatic poet, a coalion of extremities in talents rather rare; the head and the heels &s;eldom having any thing to do with each other in the way of genius. The&s;e pieces are a &s;ort of pantomimes and are called <HI>Mars and Venus, Orpheus and Euri|dice, Per&s;ius and Andromeda,</HI> and The <HI>Judgment of Paris.</HI></P>
<P>BECKINGHAM, who was repre&s;ented as a &s;oldier and nothing more, wrote <HI>Scipio Africanus,</HI> and <HI>Henry the Fourth of France</HI>; two pieces correctly re|gular and therefore in&s;ufferably dull. BROWN produced a &s;tupid farce called The <HI>Two Harlequins,</HI> from the French of LE NOBLE. Sir THOMAS MOORE
<PB N="81" REF="87">
brought out a tragedy full of the ab&s;urdities of <HI>Hur|lothrumbo</HI> without its genius, called <HI>Manjora.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;electing the following pa&s;&s;ages by way of giving an idea of the bomba&s;t that ig|norant authors fancy they may foi&s;t upon the town with impunity.

<P>Dr. SMITH. Of this gentleman a circum&s;tance is related which does the highe&s;t honour to the feel|ings and friend&s;hip of WILKS the actor. SMITH was de&s;igned for the church; but finding it impo&s;&s;i|ble to become an orator from an impediment in his &s;peech, he was determined to turn his thoughts to &s;ome other profe&s;&s;ion; and, upon con&s;idering the matter every way, he at la&s;t thought phy&s;ic the be&s;t choice he could po&s;&s;ibly make. To furni&s;h him&s;elf with the means of pro&s;ecuting his &s;tudies, he wrote a play, called The <HI>Captive Prince&s;s.</HI> It was refu&s;ed by the actors; but WILKS, entering into the &s;pirit
<PB N="82" REF="88">
of SMITH's intention, and greatly approving the good &s;en&s;e of his plan, offered him a benefit for it, which he rendered &s;o profitable, that it enabled his friend to enter him&s;elf at LEYDEN, where he applied to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic &s;o diligently that doctor BOERHAAVE recommended him to the Czarina, who made him one of the phy&s;icians of the Ru&s;&s;ian court.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WILKS received a letter from SMITH after he was e&s;tabli&s;hed in RUSSIA, in which he &s;peaks of his &s;ituation, and gives him advice of furs and other pre&s;ents which he had &s;ent him. To &s;hew how much he was obliged to WILKS, and how gratefully he felt towards him I &s;hall quote the latter part of his letter&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But who gave me the&s;e furs? This affluence? This royal mi&s;tre&s;s? this happy &s;itua|tion? A man ju&s;t of your age and &s;tature.

<P>CHETWOOD, who was many years prompter of Drury Lane, and to who&s;e anecdotes relative to theatres and actors all tho&s;e who have written on the &s;ubject of the Stage have been materially in|debted, wrote The <HI>Stock Jobbers,</HI> intended as well as another farce of this author, to expo&s;e the South Sea mania. The <HI>Lover's Opera,</HI> a piece which had but little &s;ucce&s;s, and The <HI>Generous Free Ma&s;on,</HI> a trifle only intended for Bartholomew Fair. LEIGH, an inferior actor, wrote <HI>Ken&s;ington Gardens,</HI> and <HI>Hob's Wedding,</HI> to &s;hew one would think that he was an indifferent writer as he was an actor; the latter was a continuation of DOGGET's <HI>Country Wake.</HI></P>
<P>ODELL, who had been patronized by lord WAR|TON, and who lo&s;t fir&s;t an e&s;tate in the court in|tere&s;t, but afterwards obtained a pen&s;ion, erected a theatre in Goodman's Field's, as we have already &s;een, and afterwards ceded his intere&s;t to GIFFARD. He is thought however to have made the theatre afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;t his fortune: for, &s;oon after the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="84" REF="90">
of The <HI>Golden Rump,</HI> and the accompli&s;hment of the Licencing Act, he was made Deputy Ma&s;ter of the Revels under the duke of GRAFTON, which place he held to his death. He produced for the &s;tage, <HI>Chimera,</HI> a temporary thing on the South Sea bubble, The <HI>Patron,</HI> performed with very little &s;uc|ce&s;s, The <HI>Smugglers,</HI> a farce better received, and The <HI>Prodigal,</HI> a comedy which is little more than an alteration of SHADWELL's <HI>Woman Captain</HI></P>
<P>MITCHEL, called &s;ir ROBERT WALPOLE's poet, and who was famous, like SAVAGE, for companion|able qualities and di&s;&s;ipation, wrote only a piece, of &s;ome merit, called The <HI>Highland Fair,</HI> for The <HI>Fatal Extravagance,</HI> which is attributed to him, was written by AARON HILL to do him a pecuniary kindne&s;s. CONCANEN, who was attorney general of JAMAICA, and wrote &s;ome poems, produced a thing in imitation of <HI>Tunbridge Wells and Ep&s;om Wells.</HI> It was called <HI>Wexford Wells.</HI> Two BLLLAMY's hu&s;band and &s;on to a lady who kept a boarding &s;chool at Chel&s;ea, wrote between them eight pieces merely for the &s;cholars. They are principally tran&s;lations from GUARINI and others. STURMY, who is but little known, wrote <HI>Love and Duly,</HI> The <HI>Compro|mi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Se&s;o&s;tris.</HI> The&s;e pieces are &s;aid to be ill written but they afforded &s;ome hints to other
<PB N="85" REF="91">
writers. <HI>Sefo&s;tris</HI> in particular is &s;uppo&s;ed to have furni&s;hed VOLTAIRE with materials for his <HI>Merope,</HI> which is po&s;&s;ible; though, as GILBERT in 1643, CHAPELLE in 1683, and LE GRANGE in 1691, had treated this &s;ubject; it is more likely not only that VOLTAIRE borrowed from his own countrymen, but that STURMY re&s;orted to the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>
<P>DUNCOMBE tran&s;lated RACINE's <HI>Athaliah,</HI> and wrote <HI>Junius Brutus.</HI> He is only known by being re|lated by marriage to HUGHES. STERLING was one of the a&s;&s;ociates of MITCHELL; but he reformed, and took orders. He wrote the <HI>Rival Generals,</HI> and the <HI>Parricide,</HI> neither of which are particularly no|ticed by any writer. PITCAIRNE, intended for the church, and afterwards eminent as a phy&s;ician, wrote a comedy called The <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> as we are told; but, as the invidious and unhand&s;ome abu&s;e, of which this piece is full, does not by any means character|ize the mind or talents of this great man, the au|thenticity of his being the author of it is very que&s;tionable.</P>
<P>FENTON who experienced various fortune, who tran&s;lated &s;everal books of HOMER's <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey</HI> pub|li&s;hed by POPE, and was requited by a &s;mall gra|tuity and a &s;tolen epitaph, wrote a tragedy upon the
<PB N="86" REF="92">
well known &s;ubject of <HI>Mariamne.</HI> It came out in 1723, and was the means of rai&s;ing the reputation of the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. SOUTHERN is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted FENTON. CIBBER had no opinion of the play which fact, has been told to his prejudice. The town and CIBBER certainly did not think alike for FENTON got a thou&s;and pounds for his trouble.</P>
<P>The celebrated ALLAN RAMSAY, be&s;ides The <HI>Gentle Shepherd,</HI> which has at various times been performed with much reputation, brought out a com|plimentary piece called The <HI>Nuptials.</HI> ROBE pro|duced The <HI>Fatal Legacy.</HI> WILLIAMS brought out a local performance called <HI>Richmond Wells.</HI> HOW|LING promi&s;ed to produce four pieces of which we are furni&s;hed with the titles, but I fancy nobody ever &s;aw the plays them&s;elves. LOVET, one of MITCHELL's intimates, wrote The <HI>Ba&s;tard.</HI> THUR|MOND was the &s;on of the actor of that name, and produced five pantomimic operas called <HI>Harlequin Shepherd, Apollo and Daphne, Harlequin Dr. Fau&s;tus,</HI> another <HI>Apollo and Daphne,</HI> and <HI>Harlequin's Triumph,</HI> none of the&s;e have any relation to THEOBALD's pantomimes. SANDFORD wrote The <HI>Female Fop.</HI></P>
<P>COOKE at nineteen gave the world an edition of
<PB N="87" REF="93">
<HI>Andrew Marvel,</HI> and afterwards other productions, through which he &s;tands upon good ground as a &s;cholar. This reputation he has however thrown down by his dramatic writings which are <HI>Albion, Battle of the Poets,</HI> The <HI>Triumph of Love and Honour,</HI> The <HI>Eunuch,</HI> from TERENCE of cour&s;e, The <HI>Mournful Nuptials, Love the Cau&s;e and the Cure of Grief,</HI> and <HI>Amphytrion</HI> from PLAUTOS. H. JOHN|SON tran&s;lated <HI>Romulus</HI> from De la MOTTE. JEF|FREYS wrote three pieces publi&s;hed together called <HI>Edwin, Merope,</HI> and The <HI>Triumph of Truth</HI>; the la&s;t is an oratorio.</P>

<P>FROWDE, who was one of ADDISON's &s;atelites, wrote The <HI>Fall of Saguntum,</HI> and <HI>Philotas,</HI> both tra|gedies, which however had no &s;ucce&s;s, though they were &s;trongly &s;upported both privately and publicly, ASHTON wrote an indifferent play called The <HI>Battle of Aughrim.</HI> WALKER, the original Macheath, wrote The <HI>Quaker's Opera,</HI> and The <HI>Fate of Villany.</HI> BARFORD produced an un&s;ucce&s;sful piece called

His dramatic pieces are not the be&s;t of his writings. His <HI>Hi&s;tory of England</HI> is much e&s;teemed, and &s;o are his political pamphlets, One of his productions dared to point at POPE and his friends, and he was mo&s;t illiberally, and in a &s;train of malignant fal&s;ity, put into the <HI>Dunciad.</HI> His plays are The <HI>Fa&s;hionable Lady,</HI> one of the ma&s;s of operas that generated from the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> The <HI>Fall of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex,</HI> altered from BANKS, The <HI>A&s;trolo|ger,</HI> altered from <HI>Albumazor.</HI> This play was performed but one night, and then to twenty one pounds, and revived afterwards with a prologue written by GAR|RICK, and yet the audience were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The <HI>Lawyer's Fea&s;t</HI> was a mere trifle. It however had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. TRACY wrote <HI>Periander,</HI> of which we only know that it was privately prai&s;ed and publicly con|demned.
<PB N="91" REF="97">
The private applau&s;e can be accounted for. The author read his tragedy to his friends and on the &s;ame evening gave them an elegant &s;upper, when it was univer&s;ally agreed that, if the play was reli&s;hed as well as the &s;upper it would do.</P>
<P>DRAPER, wrote The <HI>Spendthrift.</HI> There is no trace of the author or his piece, except this po&s;itive a&s;|&s;ertion.

DRURY, an attorney, wrote a farcical ballad opera called The <HI>Devil of a Duke,</HI> The <HI>Mad Captain,</HI> The <HI>Fancied Queen,</HI> and The <HI>Rival Milliners,</HI> which la&s;t is a burle&s;que, a &s;pecies of writing that cannot be attempted to effect but by men of merit, of which number DRURY unfortunately did not make one.

In that very year BOND, in the French account, is &s;tated to have been in FRANCE, and &s;o delighted with <HI>Zaire,</HI> that he was determined to get a tran&s;lation of it for the Engli&s;h Stage, which he was very com|petent to in&s;pect, though he was no writer, for he had learnt the play by heart, and was &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;t to it that it was continually his practice to repeat the mo&s;t &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages in the PARIS coffee hou&s;es. Upon his return, as we have &s;een before, he procured it to be tran&s;lated, not by AARON HILL, but mo&s;t likely the author of the <HI>Tu&s;can Treaty,</HI> and it is al&s;o very likely that the managers refu&s;ed to accept it becau&s;e it was the labour of a man who had produced an un&s;ucce&s;sful play. This was in 1734. HILL's play came out in 1735, who would hardly have &s;neaked into York Buildings to get at the opinion of a few individuals when he was always welcome to the voice of the town. Nay it is po&s;&s;ible that the treaty of the managers with HILL for his tran&s;lation was a rea&s;on why they refu&s;ed the play from BOND. At any rate the hi&s;torians &s;eem to be wholly in the dark as to the real hi&s;tory of BOND, and therefore as it has been their u&s;ual practi&s;e, when they could not find out the truth; the private tran&s;|lation of <HI>Zara,</HI> they give at once to HILL, who&s;e play was known, talked of, and &s;tipulated for, long before it made its appearance, and who could not have had a doubt of its &s;ucce&s;s at a time when VOL|TAIRE's play was in every body's mouth as one of the mo&s;t popular that ever was produced. In addition to all this I have an account which is corroborated as I under&s;tand by the Gentleman's Magazine of <HI>Zara,</HI> tran&s;lated by a gentleman of the name of JOHNSON, and printed in the year 1735.</NOTE>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. GARRICK.</HEAD>
<P>IT is neither within my promi&s;e nor my inclination to put my&s;elf forward as the biographer of GAR|RICK. For my own part I think it very immaterial to the fame of a public character to manife&s;t much anxiety as to where he was born, at what &s;chool he was brought up, and many other particulars which I am not to learn are held &s;acredly and indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary in biography; a re&s;earch generally however terminating in uncertainty, and di&s;appointment, and which therefore unfortunately leaves this &s;pecies of writing incomplete by the want of one of its at|tributed unities. As I have had opportunity to urge this before, and, as all tho&s;e who e&s;teem merit and genius for their intrin&s;ic value will be naturally more &s;olicitous to &s;et up their locality than that of the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, I &s;hall endeavour to gratify the&s;e by a de&s;cription of the mental acqui|&s;itions of GARRICK, which I had particular op|portunity
<PB N="101" REF="105">
of watching for &s;even years through all their &s;hades and gradations.</P>
<P>The words that CIBBER applied to BETTER|TON, that he was an actor as SHAKESPERR was a poet, may unequivocally be applied to GARRICK, but one &s;trong circum&s;tanee, which I believe has never been noticed, and which when noticed will be, &s;paringly at fir&s;t perhaps, but afterwards gene|rally and literally admitted, &s;hews that GARRICK mu&s;t have been nearer in his genius to the com|parative merit of SHAKESPEAR than BETTERTON. This circum&s;tance, which I a&s;&s;ert without he&s;itation, is that GARRICK, at any time, on or off the &s;tage, alone or in company, about whatever occupation, &s;tudy or pur&s;uit, or in &s;hort employed in any man|ner he might, was an actor, a complete actor, and nothing but an actor, exactly as POPE during the whole cour&s;e of his life was a poet and nothing but a poet.</P>
<P>The acting of GARRICK on the &s;tage was to ac|quire fame and fortune, than which nothing was ever more fairly earned and merited; and off the &s;tage, to make that fame and fortune a &s;ource of reputa|tion, con&s;equence, and importance, and in this la&s;t &s;pecies of acting he certainly manife&s;ted more po|tent
<PB N="102" REF="106">
merit, more commanding talents, than in the fir&s;t, incompatible as his public acting was. No man exacted homage from all ranks with more &s;uc|ce&s;s than GARRICK. He was a man, as the Iri&s;h &s;ay, that you never caught without him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Tis true that to attain this &s;ort of rank with the world the marvellous &s;ide mu&s;t be perpetually turned outward, and the hidden &s;prings and wires mu&s;t be managed with great dexterity and exactne&s;s to keep up the deception. Any invention, how|ever ingenious in its con&s;truction, and wonderful in its operation, would cea&s;e to excite admiration if the &s;pectator was to di&s;cover that it worked upon common mechanical principles, and therefore GAR|RICK, who GOLDSMITH &s;eems to have known <HI>au fond.</HI>
<Q><L>" Who threw off his friends, as a hunt&s;man his pack,</L>
<L>" For he knew well enough he could whi&s;tle them back,"</L></Q>
knew al&s;o that off the &s;tage, as well as on, it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ubdue his own pa&s;&s;ions that he might the better &s;ubdue the pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;pectators.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw GARRICK either laugh or cry; that is to &s;ay, &s;hed tears, or manife&s;t mirth, or even plea|&s;ure, &s;pontaniou&s;ly, involuntarily, and from the &s;oul.
<PB N="10" REF="107">
I have &s;een him taking the hint from SHAKESPEAR, who has certainly well de&s;cribed real acting by the pa&s;&s;age,

<L>" A broken voice, and his whole function &s;uiting</L>

<L>" For Hecuba&mdash;"</L></Q></P>
<P>All this and the oppo&s;ite extreme were always at his command<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GARRICK would indulge &s;ome few friends&mdash;but it was very rare&mdash;with what he u&s;ed to call his <HI>rounds.</HI>&mdash;This he did by &s;tand|ing behind a chair, and conveying into his face every po&s;&s;ible kind of pa&s;&s;ion, blending one into the other, and as it were &s;hadowing them with a prodigious number of gradations. At one moment you laughed, at another you cried: now he terrified you, and pre&s;ently you conceived your&s;elf &s;omething horrible, he &s;eemed &s;o terrified at you. Afterwards he drew his features into the appearance of &s;uch dignified wi&s;dom, that MINERVA might have been proud of the portrait; and then&mdash;degrading yet admirable tran&s;ition&mdash;he became a driveller. In &s;hort his face was what he obliged you to fancy it; age, youth, plenty, poverty, every thing it a&s;&s;umed.</NOTE>. His laugh was well put on, but it was not a natural laugh of his own. He &s;eemed afraid that if he did not conquer a propen&s;ity to ri&s;i|bility in him&s;elf, the better to provoke it in his audience, he &s;hould like TOM THIMBLE, in the <HI>Rehear&s;al,</HI> be &s;o tickled by the humour of his au|thor,
<PB N="104" REF="108">
as not to be able to play his part. In &s;hort, no man will deny but that the very e&s;&s;ence of excellent acting centered in GARRICK, and yet every mem|ber of the theatre will vouch for me, that the greate&s;t and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effects produced by his acting aro&s;e from an artful &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of his real feelings, le&s;t they &s;hould provoke him into a &s;en&s;ibility which it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;fer to his auditors.</P>
<P>In acting, the human pa&s;&s;ions would run riot were they not kept in ab&s;olute command. Feeling and &s;en&s;ibility are the riches of an actor, and would too &s;oon be &s;quandered if they were not managed with economy. There are very few &s;ituations in tragedy, and the great art is how to vary them. A pa&s;&s;ion, like a colour, mu&s;t have a variety of &s;ha|dows; nor will every &s;hadow do for the &s;ame light; and I will even venture to &s;ay, that a good actor or actre&s;s &s;hould vary the mode of acting, according to the different di&s;po&s;itions of the audiences before whom they appear.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely mention this as my real &s;entiments on good acting. Every thing on the &s;tage mu&s;t be a little elevated. The &s;cenes, if they were highly fini&s;hed, would lo&s;e all their effect. The &s;ame mode mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in dre&s;s, and it holds good
<PB N="105" REF="109">
throughout every thing el&s;e. A hero mu&s;t not &s;peak in common pro&s;e&mdash;it mu&s;t be mea&s;ured for him into what we call blank ver&s;e. This gives a dignity, an empha&s;is to the feeling that is to be expre&s;&s;ed, and unle&s;s the actor who repre&s;ents the character can &s;o far po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf with an idea that he is the very hero for the time being, he will never attain perfection as his &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>The&s;e requi&s;ites, which GARRICK taught him&s;elf on the &s;tage, he could with the &s;ame facility transfer to his private conduct; and, whether he conde|&s;cended at his own levee to &s;mile at a borrowing actor who was prai&s;ing his poety, cut jokes with BECKET the book&s;eller, explain an unintelligible pa&s;&s;age to PHIL BUTLER the carpenter, blame HOPKINS the prompter for having the gout becau&s;e he was at the expence of chair hire, rebuke MES|SINK the pantomime trick maker for attempting to be witty like him, chuckle at new&s;paper critici&s;ms that he intended to buy off, or burn cards and letters from dukes, lords, judges, and bi&s;hops, to &s;trike his dependants with awe and admiration&mdash;</P>
<P>Whether at court he honoured men of title with the hopes of bol&s;tering up the reputation of &s;ome dramatic brat produced with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<PB N="106" REF="110">
chaplain, whether ladies were promi&s;ed that their friends &s;hould be di&s;appointed of boxes that had never been let, or that the new fa&s;hion they la&s;t pro|duced &s;hould be noticed in the next epilogue, or that an epitaph on a favourite parrot &s;hould grace the toilette table, or whether he appeared di&s;tre&s;&s;ed that he could not be let down by an amba&s;&s;ador, becau&s;e he had given a prior promi&s;e to a counte&s;s dowager&mdash;</P>
<P>Whether at the rehear&s;al of a piece, his own, he demanded an acknowledgment that every pa&s;&s;age was the achme of perfection, or at the rehear&s;al of a piece, not his own, he him&s;elf allowed prai&s;e in pro|portion as he was permitted to make alterations; or, to be brief, in whatever manner by managing not the minds, for many of them were too ponderous for him to wield, but the tempers of men, both of the fir&s;t wordly and profe&s;&s;ional di&s;tinction&mdash;he &s;o played his part as to be courted, carre&s;&s;ed, admired, and looked up to by rank and talents, with very &s;light preten&s;ions to the character of eminent abilities him|&s;elf otherwi&s;e than as an actor.</P>
<P>GARRICK pro&s;e&s;&s;edly &s;tudied the character of CIBBER, than whom however he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more con&s;ummate abilities except as a writer, but he
<PB N="107" REF="111">
blended with this character the e&s;&s;ence of every other that had been celebrated for acquiring fame by wordly conduct, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much &s;uper|raded good &s;en&s;e, that he &s;eldom ran into any of their inferior follies, and never into tho&s;e of any magnitude. He had what he called common &s;en&s;e, to which he gave an unbounded definition, and practically &s;hewed that its meaning was to take every advantage within the pale of fair dealing, upon the mart, like a chapman; upon this principle he con|ducted all his wordly concerns, liberal in offers, and clo&s;e at a bargain.</P>
<P>By this mode of conduct, though his wi&s;hes were characterized by boundle&s;s ambition, he never let them impo&s;e upon his rea&s;on, and thus, by never out &s;oaring his &s;trength, he was at no time in dan|ger of falling. GARRICK might, have been laureat, he might have had a &s;eat in parliament, he might have been knighted, but he knew he could write a a prologue better than a birth day ode, that his oratory would have been a poor bu&s;ine&s;s if it had been called upon extemporaneou&s;ly in his own lan|guage, and without dre&s;s and action, and he could anticipate the ridicule of &s;eeing again&s;t the wall the
<PB N="108" REF="112">
part of Abel Drugger to be performed by Sir DAVID GARRICK.</P>
<P>All the&s;e meritorious acts of becoming forbear|ance &s;poke in him the highe&s;t degree of good &s;en&s;e, and became the foundation of that general action by which he commanded the attention, the regard, the &s;olicitude, and better than the&s;e, the contributions of mankind. It was this put into practi&s;e, through the medium of common &s;en&s;e, as we have &s;een it de|fined, that made him the idol of the great in fortune, and the great in talents; to none of whom he was at any time offen&s;ive, though he always arrogated equa|lity. In &s;hort, he was a duke, a lawgiver, a philo&s;o|pher, a logician, an architect, a painter, nay a &s;cho|lar, and a critic, and even in the opinions of tho&s;e mo&s;t eminent for the&s;e di&s;tinctions, when in fact tho&s;e &s;entiments which he had deliberately collected, and which he &s;ported through the advantage of a lucky moment, were the &s;tudied ideas of others, acted by him.</P>
<P>One of GARRICK's great &s;trokes of Mundane acting was the fame he was &s;o &s;olicitous to com|mand abroad, in which he &s;o &s;ucceeded that the French accounts of him in particular, which it is a
<PB N="109" REF="113">
pity his biographers had no opportunity of con&s;ult|ing, exalt his merit, excellent as it was, infinitely beyond any thing that we have of him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Speaking of his acting, a French author has the following pa&s;|&s;age.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"GARRICK the celebrated Engli&s;h ROSCIUS has alone, per|haps, been capable of conveying all that we have heard or can conceive of the a&s;toni&s;hing acting of the ancients. I &s;aw him in London,"</Q>
&s;ays the writer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perform a tyrant who dies on the &s;tage terrified with the enormity of his crimes and torne with re|mor&s;e. Humanity in the la&s;t moments of this tyrant triumphs over his crimes, his murders, and his barbarity. Sen&s;ible too late of his villainy, his reflections are his judge and his executioner: overwhelmed with this dreadful conflict he dies piece meal; his eyes begin to be extingui&s;hed, his voice can &s;carcely articulate his ineffectual penitence; his ge&s;tures announce his la&s;t moment; na|ture, yet retains &s;ome &s;trength, and, as the human faculties decay and horrible phantoms bring his crimes to his imagination, in his frantic fear he &s;truggles with death and is overcome; he now faintly freezes with horror; he tears up the earth and &s;eems in madening fancy to dig his grave; and now the moment of death arrives, and the convul&s;ive di&s;traction of his face, his quivering lips, the exten&s;ion of his arms, and a la&s;t agonizing &s;igh, give the fini&s;hing &s;troke to this terrible picture."</Q></P>
<P>In another French writer I find the following anecdote of GAR|RICK told as a proof that he could not only at will repre&s;ent all pa&s;|&s;ions but all per&s;ons. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A woman of fa&s;hion in London."</Q> &s;ays this writer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had a great de&s;ire to procure the portrait of a nobleman with whom &s;he was in love, but who had a particular aver&s;ion to &s;it for his picture. She prevailed upon GARRICK to notice the face of this lord, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of his features that the painter might ea&s;ily de&s;ign a faithful likene&s;s through the medium of his borrowed re&s;emblance. This was undertaken; and, after having &s;tudied every trait and ge&s;ture, and each po&s;&s;ible manner of giving them variety till it was no longer GARRICK, but My Lord, the painter was &s;et to work, and &s;o &s;ucceeded that the por|trait was univer&s;ally known for the nobleman in que&s;tion who was the fir&s;t to expre&s;s his a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o perfect a likene&s;s being obtained without his knowledge, and who liberally rewarded the actor and married the lady, in return for her love, and her inge|nuity."</Q>
I never heard of this anecdote through any other chan|nel. There is a &s;tory told that GARRICK frightened HOGARTH by appearing to him as the gho&s;t of FIELDING, whom he &s;o re&s;embled by altering his features that HOGARTH is &s;aid never to have re|covered the &s;hock. It is a &s;trange &s;tory however, unle&s;s GARRICK walked upon &s;tilts.</P></NOTE>. It was,
<PB N="110" REF="114">
however, occa&s;ioned &s;ometimes by rather bold and prodigious flights. A friend might have &s;huddered for him to have been pre&s;ent when VOLTAIRE re|ceived his Ode on SHAKESPEAR, e&s;pecially as it happened at the time when that dictator was fretting away his life in his retirement at GENEVA, and ful|minating his critical anathemas again&s;t dunces; but whether he was &s;oftened by the pre&s;ent that accom|panied it, or however he might be wrought upon by that magical per&s;ua&s;ion which GARRICK &s;ometimes accorded but never gave, it is certain, for I &s;aw it, that the circum&s;tance produced an acknowledgment full of in&s;incere prai&s;e of which GARRICK believed perhaps but very little, but, what was better for him, the world believed the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="115">In the performance of all the&s;e various parts, one con&s;ideration obtruded it&s;elf on GARRICK's mind and operated as a material deduction from the ap|plau&s;e &s;o lavi&s;hly be&s;towed on &s;o much profe&s;&s;ional excellence. This was no le&s;s than a continual &s;ore|ne&s;s occa&s;ioned by certain flies that perpetually buzzed about him and never cea&s;ed to teaze and torment him till they were &s;uffered to &s;uck their fill and drop off. If he had &s;et out with a firm and re|&s;olute determination, the fatal examples of DRY|DEN and POPE before him, to have armed him&s;elf with indifference, they would have hummed their day and been forgotten; but he wanted &s;trength of mind to take this cour&s;e. He &s;hould have con&s;idered that he had not the abilities to re&s;ort to <HI>Mac Fleck|noes</HI> and <HI>Dunciads,</HI> or even had he been capable of wielding &s;uch formidable weapons, they had been already rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the immaterial beings they had to cope with. Clubs cannot wound atoms.</P>
<P>GARRICK, a better actor in every other re&s;pect, though con&s;tantly his emulator, unfortunately di&s;|dained to copy CIBBER in this; half of who&s;e re|putation at lea&s;t was owing to a &s;teady re&s;olution of di&s;regarding anonymous cavillers, or el&s;e coaxing them into &s;ome &s;crape that he might take a mo&s;t tri|umphant
<PB N="112" REF="116">
advantage of them. CIBBER turned the &s;atire in the <HI>Dunciad</HI> mo&s;t pointedly again&s;t POPE, whereas GARRICK would have &s;unk under it; but CIBBER was a writer of a different de&s;cription, far however from being perfect, and this he &s;o truly knew and &s;o hone&s;tly acknowledged, that cavil was by him politically deprecated, and the &s;hafts of ill nature di&s;armed by anticipation.</P>
<P>Had GARRICK given an idea that he went for nothing but a prologue writer, and that his other productions were merely in aid of that experience and dramatic knowledge which as a manager he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily po&s;&s;e&s;s, the fo&s;tering care of the public would have carre&s;&s;ed and nurtured the&s;e offsprings of diffidenee, and, having adopted them, have be|come &s;o blind to their foibles that he would have re|ceived credit for much more than his fair reputation; whereas, fondly fancying that the world implicitly believed him an author of fir&s;t rate merit, that they would find better poetry in his prologues than in tho&s;e of DRYDEN, truer character and nature in his plays than in any of his predece&s;&s;ors, and more lyric beauty in his <HI>Ode</HI> than in <HI>Alexander's Fea&s;t,</HI> the world have not come up to his actual de&s;ert, but have &s;unk him in every other re&s;pect, and quietly have &s;et him down as a mere prologue writer; which
<PB N="113" REF="117">
as the &s;ubjects of his prologues and epilogues were merely temporary and a la&s;h at &s;ome prevailing folly, is every thing but denying him any merit as a writer at all.</P>
<P>Unfortunately this was GARRICK's foible. His writings were his tendon Achilles, which the meere&s;t witling was at any time Paris enough to find out; and, le&s;t he feared it would remain undi&s;covered, un|le&s;s he him&s;elf perpetually expo&s;ed it, he unnece&s;|&s;arily and upon every trivial occa&s;ion bared it to view; till, by &s;hewing how he might be wounded, the wor&s;t bungler at critical archery in all Grub|&s;treet, was &s;ure to hit him.</P>
<P>When he was afraid the wits &s;hould be &s;atirical on his marriage, he anticipated their &s;atire by calling him&s;elf
<Q><L>" A very Sir JOHN BRUTE all day,</L>
<L>" And FRIBBLE all the night."</L></Q>
When he trembled at what he feared might be the judgment of the critics on his performance of Mac|beth, he fooli&s;hly wrote a pamphlet
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"on the mimi|cal behaviour of a certain fa&s;hionable faulty actor."</Q>
When he dreaded the cen&s;ure and ridicule that he imagined he &s;hould be greeted with on his return from a tour to ITALY, he produced the <HI>Sick Monkey</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="118">
as a ridicule on what was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been his conduct abroad. The&s;e are &s;ome of the in&s;tances in which his favourite common &s;en&s;e de&s;erted him.</P>
<P>He imagined that the&s;e things would be con&s;i|dered as illiberal, and therefore treated them with contempt. There were three ri&s;ks in this; fir&s;t, filth generally &s;ticks, and in this world many want ability, and more inclination to rub it off; &s;econdly, in this pretended &s;atire it was po&s;&s;ible that faults might have been expo&s;ed through con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which an indifferent per&s;on would never have &s;u&s;|pected; and la&s;tly, a di&s;covery might have been at|tended with indelible, becau&s;e meritorious, ridicule. His conduct was evidently an imitation of POPE in relation to his pa&s;torals, but POPE had more ability, and his reputation was le&s;s involved.</P>
<P>Upon an examination of his conduct as it was concerned in tho&s;e tran&s;actions that led him to the management of the theatre, which mo&s;t worthily im|proved it into an extraordinary degree of credit and reputation, his character and genius will more gradually develope than in a &s;tudied detail, I &s;hall therefore ceace to &s;peak of him particularly till I have traced the &s;teps by which he a&s;cended to the highe&s;t pitch of fame and fortune.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. STATE OF THE STAGE FROM 1741 TO 1763.</HEAD>
<P>AS GARRICK, in imitation of CIBBER, not only looked up from his infancy to the chair of ROSCIUS, which CHURCHILL accorded him after he had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed it by univer&s;al &s;uffrage, but al&s;o to the chair of management, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew what a theatrical MACHIAVAL he was in attaining the fir&s;t reputation in both capacities, neither &s;ituations hav|ing been filled at any time with &s;uch ability or &s;uch credit.</P>
<P>To drop at pre&s;ent the merit of GARRICK as an actor, to whom in that capacity I &s;hall hereafter pay my tribute of warm and willing admiration, let us &s;ee with what cautious and wary judgment he con|ducted him&s;elf to become a ma&s;ter of his profe&s;&s;ion; and while the account is read by all young actors who emulate his merit, let them at the &s;ame time emulate his indu&s;try, his various trials of his thea|trical
<PB N="116" REF="120">
powers, his gradual a&s;cent to &s;uperiority, or let them for ever de&s;pair of attaining his excellence, or indeed any excellence as actors.</P>
<P>GARRICK knew that the profe&s;&s;ion he was pecu|liarly gifted to fill required more variety of requi&s;ites than any other, that there is &s;carcely any accom|pli&s;hment the human mind or form is capable of re|ceiving but mu&s;t be &s;tudied and learnt by the actor; that conception and memory which are too often con&s;idered as perfection in the &s;cience of acting are only parts of a complicate whole, and that without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every one of the&s;e various qualities, which acquire ver&s;atility, and teach the pa&s;&s;ions a ca|pable &s;cope of repre&s;enting human nature in all its moods and humours, an actor can no more be per|fect than a watch without its wheels.</P>
<P>GARRICK knowing this, both by the examples of tho&s;e actors in the &s;chool of BETTERTON, and by his own con&s;ummate keenne&s;s and fore&s;ight, de|termined to be &s;ure of his mark, and that the arrow &s;hould go beyond the barb; in&s;tead, therefore, of ri&s;king a raw and unexperienced genius and ven|turing crudity and awkwardne&s;s, he put him&s;elf to &s;chool, and not only learnt practically every thing that experience could give as to the exerci&s;e of his
<PB N="117" REF="121">
ver&s;atile powers in tragedy and comedy, but head|ded dancing, fencing, and pantomime, and even &s;tu|died the character of Harlequin.</P>
<P>Thus his fir&s;t appearance was facination, for it blended all the attraction of novelty with veteran experience. It was u&s;ele&s;s, for QUIN to &s;ay that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was a fa&s;hion and would &s;oon be over. It was a new religion; that WHITFIELD was followed for a time, but the people came back again to church."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was not here&s;y but reformation,"</Q> as GARRICK him&s;elf wittily enough &s;aid in reply, and it proved &s;o, for the world with one con&s;ent &s;tampt it as theatrical orthodoxy.</P>
<P>GARRICK's great &s;ucce&s;s, which thinned the other theatres and brought all the world to Good|man's Fields, began very early to prove a &s;ource of fortune in proportion to the &s;avour he received, which was prodigious. GIFFARD gave him half the profits, and he &s;oon of cour&s;e ama&s;&s;ed a very large &s;um, for he performed every night for a con|&s;iderable time. This would have been a &s;erious blow at the fame and fortune of the theatres had not an application been intended, though I believe never made, to government, which was backed by the au|thority of Sir JOHN BARNARD, who in the name of
<PB N="118" REF="122">
the city was prepared to revive tho&s;e objections which we have already &s;een preferred by the ma|gi&s;trates, le&s;t the theatre &s;hould be an injury to the members of the commercial part of the town by be|ing immediately &s;eated among them.</P>
<P>GARRICK &s;eeing plainly how this would operate propo&s;ed to accommodate matters with FLEETWOOD, provided GIFFARD were made a party to the treaty. This was &s;oon adju&s;ted, and he received five hun|dred a year for his acting, and GIFFARD appears to have been &s;atisfied with the emolument allotted him in return for giving up a concern which he held by no legal authority.</P>
<P>GARRICK being now come to Drury Lane, and having in the following &s;ummer experienced im|provement, reputation, and profit by an excur&s;ion to DUBLIN, where he was &s;o attended that the va&s;t crouding produced a contagious di&s;order which was called GARRICK's fever, began to look forward to|wards the management; and, while FLEETWOOD was &s;windling the trade&s;men and performers, and bribing attornies and bailiffs to keep executions out of the hou&s;e which it was their duty to levy, he for|tified him&s;elf for the occa&s;ion both as to property and friends. He &s;aw, however, that the moment
<PB N="119" REF="123">
was not arrived for him to &s;tep forward, for that the theatre was going &s;o fa&s;t to ruin that it would be ex|tremely difficult to have any concern in it without involving his private fortune with the general in|tere&s;t of the concern.</P>
<P>He was taught by this an extraordinary con|temptation. He could not be in&s;en&s;ible that, pro|perly applied, the large &s;ums his performance brought to the theatre might have liquidated, or at lea&s;t le&s;&s;ened the demands on the property &s;o as to make it in time a clear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the proprietor; but the rever&s;e was the fact. The trea&s;ury was the &s;ieves of the Danaides always full and always empty, and FLEETWOOD plainly &s;aw that, by a proper glo&s;s and a little adroitne&s;s in legerdemain, hidden by well applied juggling and &s;mall talk, the richer he got the more he &s;hould per&s;uade the poor devils who were mortified at his pride, his in&s;olence, and his want of feeling, but at the &s;ame time delighted by his good humour, his wit, and his plau&s;ibility, to believe him in nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>What a &s;chool was this for par&s;imony to a par&s;i+monious man like GARRICK. I never heard that there was any complaint as to his money, indeed it has been thought that GARRICK, MACKLIN, and

another or two, were in a compact with FLEET|WOOD that &s;o he might laugh at the re&s;t of the com|pany, covered by their united &s;trength. I &s;carcely know, however, how to give credit to this, becau&s;e MACKLIN declared in my hearing, and in the pre|&s;ence of &s;everal gentlemen now living, that it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the performers to invent all manner of tricks to procure that money which, though their own, they could not obtain by per&s;ua&s;ion, importu|nity, or menace, and that he him&s;elf, who was im|powered as acting manager to undertake for the pay|ment of certain articles, and was therefore in &s;ome &s;ort amenable, was once under the nece&s;&s;ity of putting into practi&s;e a &s;tratagem in which he pretended to have broke out of Newgate, where he &s;aid he had been put by a creditor, and thereby obtained the &s;um he wanted, which he appropriated to his own u&s;e, it being part of his ju&s;t demand, and afterwards left the creditor to &s;ue FLEETWOOD.</P>
<P>Certainly &s;omehow or other GARRICK &s;ound his account in &s;taying at Drury Lane, for Covent Gar|den was at any time open to him; but he accepted no engagement any where till 1745, at which time, though the publi&s;hed accounts are again&s;t me, I think it very probable that FLEETWOOD went to FRANCE, and not in 1747, as it is generally believed, for at
<PB N="121" REF="125">
that time the patent was &s;old by FLEETWOOD to GREEN and AMBER, bankers in the city, who &s;pe|culated upon it clogged with a hopeful condition no le&s;s than that LACEY, who we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee as the partner of GARRICK, was to manage the concern.</P>
<P>LACEY had been a &s;ort of a&s;&s;i&s;tant to RICH, after leaving an unprofitable trade at NORWICH, and becoming a very indifferent actor. The conditions of this purcha&s;e were that GREEN and AMBER &s;hould pay three thou&s;and two hundred pounds for the patent, and an annuity to FLEETWOOD, till it &s;hould be expired, of &s;ix hundred pounds, and at the &s;ame time a mortgage of &s;even thou&s;and pounds on the property was &s;uffered to remain, and LACEY for his management was to have a third of the pro|fits. GREEN and AMBER in a very &s;hort time be|came bankrupts, and the patent was put up to pub|lic &s;ale. Whether, therefore, GARRICK fore&s;aw every one of the&s;e con&s;equences and did not chu&s;e to interfere till a clear and an ea&s;y purcha&s;e &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf, or perhaps till his intere&s;t was &s;trength|ened by an accumulation of connections, it is equally certain that from the moment of his fir&s;t appearance he had an eye to the management, and that he de|termined to forbear from engaging in it till it &s;hould
<PB N="122" REF="126">
be in his power to do &s;o without being entangled or embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is pretty well proved by his conduct previous to his taking the management, which was of a piece with that prior to his commencing actor; for, as he had gone in 1740 to IPSWICH to try the effect of his per&s;onal appearance on the &s;tage, &s;o, in 1745, he went again to IRELAND, in order to feel out what his deportment ought to be as director behind the &s;cenes, and even here he proved him&s;elf an ex|cellent di&s;criminator, for he allied him&s;elf to Mr. SHERIDAN, a man from who&s;e knowledge, judg|ment, liberality, and rectitude he would not fail to receive every in&s;truction nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After attaining this experience GARRICK en|gaged him&s;elf at Covent Garden during the &s;ea&s;on of 1746, and then in conjunction with LACEY pur|cha&s;ed the patent, and paid off the mortgage, the whole &s;um amounting to twelve thou&s;and pounds. They al&s;o continued FLEETWOOD's annuity, which certainly was not all he got by the bargain; for be|&s;ides the three thou&s;and pounds he received for the patent, very little of which one would &s;uppo&s;e he gave to his creditors, he mo&s;t probably had been for a con&s;iderable time &s;aving out of the fire. I
<PB N="123" REF="127">
can my&s;elf vouch that his &s;on, I do not mean the &s;on that went to India, but him to whom he left his for|tune, lived about four and thirty years ago in a very hand&s;ome &s;tyle, went to court, and joined in ex|pen&s;ive plea&s;ures with people of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>It is true this fortune was di&s;&s;ipated in a few years, but it mu&s;t certainly have been &s;omething very con&s;iderable, and as this was at the di&s;tance of &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years after the expiration of the patent, when the annuity to FLEETWOOD cea&s;ed, he mu&s;t have &s;aved money, and that not a trifle, exclu&s;ively, that is to &s;ay, out of the earnings of tho&s;e performers he cajoled, impo&s;ed upon, di&s;ap|pointed, delighted, and robbed.</P>
<P>The next wonder is how LACEY could get the mo|ney to purcha&s;e his &s;hare of the patent, for we know he was not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by GARRICK, becau&s;e his full and entire half remained with him till that unfortu|nate propen&s;ity to dig for coals in OXFORDSHIRE induced him to get al&s;o a propen&s;ity of mortgaging his &s;hare piecemeal to his partner. It has been &s;aid that he bought a very beautiful hor&s;e to captivate the Duke of GRAFTON; who, offering any price for it, was told that the highe&s;t price that could be
<PB N="124" REF="128">
fixed for it would be his Grace's acceptance, which hand&s;ome offer being graciou&s;ly acceded to, he, through the intere&s;t of this nobleman, obtained a renewal of the patent, and that, therefore, he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by GARRICK; but this is very improbable, for it is not difficult to &s;ee that GARRICK could &s;carcely at that time have hinted a reque&s;t to per&s;ons of condition and in power which would not have been readily granted, e&s;pecially any thing &s;o evidently beneficial to the public and the credit of the theatre, after the di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;credit it had &s;o long ex|perienced.</P>
<P>The real fact mu&s;t remain a my&s;tery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have taken &s;ome pains to come at this fact, though after all it is not of any great importance. LACEY was manager during the &s;hort time that GREEN and AMBER held the property, and after their bankrupt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y, perhaps in tru&s;t for the a&s;&s;ignees, and I am in|formed, from an authority I cannot doubt, that he immediately pre|vious to GARRICK's joining with him in the management, &s;tood in a manner in FLEETWOOD's &s;hoes, and compounded with the performers and creditors of different de&s;criptions, which is an additional argu|ment in proof of GARRICK's &s;tipulating for a clear &s;tage and no favour.</NOTE>. In the mean time it is my bu&s;ine&s;s to relate that, with a renewal of the patent the&s;e joint proprietors upon equal &s;hares opened the theatre in 1747, with JOHNSON's cele|brated Prologue. The be&s;t actors and actre&s;&s;es of
<PB N="125" REF="129">
cour&s;e rallied round GARRICK, and he was &s;oon re|inforced by BARRY, Mrs. PRITCHARD, and Mrs. CIBBER.</P>
<P>As to Covent Garden theatre it continued till 1760, to be uninteruptedly managed by RICH; who, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, upon his father's plan, though he was not the &s;ame ne&s;arious character, con|tinued to keep him&s;elf up as a formidable rival to the managers of Drury Lane. His own performance of Harlequin, and the advantage he took of Engli&s;h inclination for foreign gewgaws now and then ope|rated in his favour with decided &s;uperiority. In the time of FLEETWOOD, his pantomimes were a great injury to his opponents; and, though I do not find he was ever &s;plendidly off, indeed he is de&s;cribed to have been at one time &s;o nece&s;&s;itated as to have taken a hou&s;e &s;ituated in three different counties to avoid the importunity of the Sheriffs' officers, yet he took care to &s;ati&s;fy, to the letter, his performers, and all tho&s;e with whom he made engagements.</P>
<P>This gave him a certain re&s;pectability without which no concern can maintain &s;olid reputation; but his &s;ituation was neverthele&s;s fluctuating, for, though at times the run of a &s;ucce&s;sful pantomime filled his trea&s;ury, yet his ignorance of the common
<PB N="126" REF="130">
bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre, and want of di&s;cernment as to the merit of performers, gave the other hou&s;e a pre-eminence which, with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of QUIN and others, be&s;poke the favour of the critical and the judicious, e&s;pecially after it began to feel the in|fluence of GARRICK's management.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;ucce&s;s of RICH was by fits and &s;tarts. At Chri&s;tmas, perhaps, his hou&s;e overflowed, and caricature prints were circulated with Harlequin weighing down the the theatrical &s;cales, and GAR|RICK, BARRY, and all the force of Drury Lane kicking the beam; the infatuation over, his benches were empty and continued &s;o till the French painter invented new &s;cenery, and he perfected him&s;elf in new attitudes, and invented new pantomime tricks.</P>
<P>RICH, by this means, was of great utility through|out, his whole management to the general theatrical intere&s;t. He was what a formidable minority are to an able mini&s;try; and, though his mea&s;ures were not &s;o efficacious; yet it kept the exertions of his oppo|nents braced to their full &s;trength and vigour, and this, by the operation now and then of a lucky hit, wrought wonderfully in his favour, both as to ad|vantage and popularity. We have &s;een one in&s;tance of this in the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> His own perfor|mance
<PB N="127" REF="131">
al&s;o, which was incomparable in its way, was greatly followed, and when GARRICK ran <HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> in which he and Mrs. CIBBER performed the lovers, RICH in&s;tantly oppo&s;ed to them BARRY and Mi&s;s NOSSITER.</P>
<P>By the&s;e and other &s;pirited in&s;tances of oppo|&s;ition he kept up a con&s;tant and formidable bu&s;tle which it required very frequently the whole united force of his rivals to oppo&s;e. In Spectacle he was confe&s;&s;edly &s;uperior to them; and as GARRICK knew and felt this, he ought to have entered into no competition with him, but have re&s;ted his &s;ole ex|pectation on the more re&s;pectable ground of giving every advantage to tragedy and comedy, and this he would very probably have done had it not been that &s;ufficient novelty was not to be procured, fewer authors of eminence by a con&s;iderable difference, as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee, having appeared during the fir&s;t &s;ixteen years of his management than during any equal period &s;ince SHAKESPEARE.</P>
<P>To this it may, perhaps, be owing that GARRICK was obliged to permit Spectacle occa&s;ionally in his own defence. It however at length &s;apped the foundation of his popularity; for, when RICH brought out The <HI>Coronation,</HI> which &s;o completely
<PB N="128" REF="132">
and de&s;ervedly triumphed over the &s;tupid, nig|gardly, par&s;imonious apology for it, that had been for a few nights foi&s;ted on the public at Drury Lane, Covent Garden began to feel a powerful &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>This &s;uperiority gathered &s;uch &s;trength that it began to ma&s;ter the whole exertions of GARRICK, gigantic as they were. The&s;e advantages a number of circum&s;tances combined to &s;trengthen. BEARD, perhaps upon the whole the be&s;t Engli&s;h &s;inger that ever was heard, who&s;e excellence I &s;hall not inter|rupt the thread of my pre&s;ent narrative to de&s;cribe, had married the daughter of RICH, and &s;tept pretty forward in the mu&s;ical management. This circum|&s;tance induced GARRICK to play off the old trick of <HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> by oppo&s;ing LOWE and Mrs. VINCENT, as Macheath and Polly in the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> to BEARD and Mi&s;s BRENT, which, by way of parenthe&s;is, provoked RICH to &s;tart WILKINSON in the <HI>Minor</HI> again&s;t FOOTE. The conte&s;t, however operated greatly again&s;t Drury Lane. BEARD at the head of his phalanx was irre&s;i&s;tible, and cer|tainly at no period has the real excellence and true character of Engli&s;h mu&s;ic been &s;o well under&s;tood or &s;o highly reli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Though it would be irregular to go at length
<PB N="129" REF="133">
into this &s;ubject now, yet I &s;hall indulge my&s;elf with &s;aying a few proud words merely to &s;hew that, in arts as well as in arms, we want only union to con|quer the world. The public deci&s;ion was at that time hone&s;t, fair, candid and impartial. The Italian opera was in a &s;tate of merited celebrity which it had never known before, nor can ever know again; yet was the true and genuine beauties of Engli&s;h mu&s;ic felt and acknowledged, and the &s;ame ta&s;te and judgment that admired the delicacy, the &s;weetne&s;s, and the grandeur of JOMELLI, GALLUPPI, and PERGOLESE, delighted in the nature, the truth, and the beauty of PURCELL, ARNE, and BOYCE.</P>
<P>RICH, at the in&s;tance of BEARD, brought for|ward every thing which had mu&s;ical merit with every po&s;&s;ible advantage. The <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> and The <HI>Jovial Crew,</HI> were relieved by The <HI>Chaplet,</HI> and The <HI>Shepherd's Lottery</HI>; and, to give contra&s;t con&s;equence, and diver&s;ity to tho&s;e familiar ma|terials, <HI>Comus,</HI> that wonderful union of exqui&s;ite &s;ound, with incomparable &s;en&s;e, which in the&s;e days of elephants, dragons, and flying cats, after being tortured, crippled, and mutilated, is compelled to halt on and &s;ing the dirge to its once perfect exi&s;t|ence, was brought forward with all its appropriate advantages, playful, winning, and di&s;&s;u&s;ing round
<PB N="130" REF="134">
that enchantment by which the theatre was intended to delight and improve its auditors.</P>
<P>RICH died during the run of The <HI>Coronation,</HI> having accompli&s;hed the &s;um of his glory, and left the theatre in equal &s;hares between his widow and Mrs. BEARD, Mrs. BENCROFT, and Mrs. MORRIS, his three daughters. BEARD was very &s;en&s;ibly ap|pointed manager; who, dreading, perhaps the &s;u|perior power and ability of GARRICK, whom he both loved and feared, determined to rai&s;e as for|midable an oppo&s;ition as po&s;&s;ible upon the only ground on which he was able to make any thing like an effectual &s;tand.</P>
<P>Italian &s;inging was at that time rationally and judiciou&s;ly ta&s;ted. He therefore thought that if opera could be attempted upon a grand &s;cale to a grand effect it might give our theatres a con&s;equence as to mu&s;ic, which it had never known before. He knew there was an Engli&s;hman in whom were united the great requi&s;ites of all the Italian &s;chool; who&s;e genius, mind, under&s;tanding, and knowledge were &s;uperlative. He knew the compo&s;ition of this man could be greatly &s;upported with but very little aux|iliary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the world were thus obliged by, perhaps, the greate&s;t mu&s;ical production in its
<PB N="131" REF="135">
way in this or any other country, the <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> of ARNE.</P>
<P>Other mu&s;ical pieces followed, as we &s;hall pre|&s;ently &s;ee in their place, till the property of Covent Garden became &s;o valuable that it was at length eagerly purcha&s;ed in 1767 for &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds. Thus we find that the unremitting &s;ucce&s;s of this theatre was the &s;ole cau&s;e of GARRICK's retirement to Italy. He had no novelty to produce that could &s;tem this torrent. Ho&s;t as he was, he was al|mo&s;t alone. There were &s;carcely any authors to &s;upport him; and, as to actors, KING had certainly attained that height of reputation which he has ever &s;ince invariably maintained and kept; but HOL|LAND, and O'BRIEN, were only opening into fame. QUIN had long retired, and IRELAND had deprived the &s;tage of BARRY, and WOODWARD. He had certainly &s;tarted POWEL, who&s;e merit he is &s;aid to have dreaded, which I can &s;carcely credit, becau&s;e he knew better than any body that, admirable as POWEL's genius was, with &s;o poor an under&s;tanding, it mu&s;t run riot.</P>
<P>Thus the literal fact is, that the public were no longer GARRICK-mad, which I &s;ay more to their
<PB N="132" REF="136">
&s;hame than to his. His name was no longer an at|traction. He performed to empty benches, notwith|&s;tanding the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on before he left ENGLAND he per&s;onated Scrub, the Gho&s;t in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and a great variety of other charcters in which he had never be|fore appeared, and this very naturally made him &s;o &s;ick that he retired to ITALY, that the public might feel his lo&s;s; which they did mo&s;t completely by the management of his partner; who, finding <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> had grown into high celebrity in&s;tantly brought out a &s;tring of &s;erious operas, without con&s;idering that to produce pieces of that de&s;cription it is nece&s;&s;ary to have writers, compo&s;ers, and &s;ingers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. GARRICK AS AN AUTHOR TO 1763.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the merit of GARRICK, con&s;idered as an author, is the deepe&s;t &s;hade in his public character, yet it is one that very frequently relieves the picture to advantage; for, though, had he been nothing el&s;e his reputation would have been indeed but of a very inferior kind, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance this quality lent to the &s;tage, and to &s;tage effect, was of a fir&s;t rate con&s;e|quence, for it improved and elevated his own acting, &s;eperated, &s;implified, and regulated the productions of greater talents, and gave altogether a tone to the theatre which rendered it within the comprehen&s;ion and ta&s;te of the public, and highly promoted its in|tere&s;t as a &s;chool of nature.</P>
<P>As manager, a quality of this perfect kind was to him and indeed to the public of con&s;ummate ad|vantage, and his conduct here in oppo&s;ition to CIB|BER &s;hews that he not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in a much
<PB N="134" REF="138">
more eminent degree, but knew better how to make u&s;e of it; for GARRICK would never have refu&s;ed The <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> which CIBBER did; he knew too well his own intere&s;t. It is true we &s;hall at times trace &s;ome traits of the man that now and then eclip&s;ed the actor, &s;uch as his refu&s;al of <HI>She Stoops to Conquer,</HI> becau&s;e GOLDSMITH wrote <HI>Retaliation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GOLDSMITH's account of this in my hearing was that GAR|RICK wanted to foi&s;t in &s;o much &s;tuff of his own that he grew tired of his objections and would not leave the play with him, which foi&s;ting in, perhaps, would have done the effect of the play no in|jury, though GOLDSMITH was twenty times a better writer than GARRICK; but this was not the ca&s;e. GOLDSMITH had offended GARRICK, for a forced &s;mile with him was always a &s;ymptom of anger, and therefore he would not take the pains to whi&s;tle to him. Thus knowing that GOLDSMITH was tremblingly alive all o'er upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions, which as an author was natural enough, but as a play|wright might have been &s;pared, he only claimed the privilege that other authors had given who had been benefited by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and this offer being, as he knew it would be, refu&s;ed, he had a fair ex|cu&s;e for getting rid of the play, which both his re&s;entment to GOLD|SMITH and his friend&s;hip to KELLY, who, together with &s;entimental comedy was cut up by it, had predetermined him not to accept upon any account.</NOTE>, and other in&s;tances; but upon the whole his judg|ment was a very material cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s of dra|matic authors in the reign of GARRICK.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice obliges us from this conclu&s;ion to acknow|ledge that GARRICK's merit, as a dramatic writer,
<PB N="135" REF="139">
con&s;i&s;ts more of what is concealed from the public than what has been publi&s;hed; for he had little ge|nius and great judgment, and, therefore, though his judgment became of the highe&s;t con&s;equence in di|recting genius in the productions of others it only &s;erved to detect a paucity of genius in his own.</P>
<P>There is another and a material deduction from the merit of GARRICK, and yet it ought not to weigh again&s;t his reputation. I mean the reiterated ne|ce&s;&s;ity of writing pieces for temporary purpo&s;es in quality of manager. We have &s;een the be&s;t talents upon the&s;e &s;ubjects wa&s;ted to little purpo&s;e, and therefore much merit is attributable to him, who never actually failed in any one of the&s;e in&s;tances; on the contrary, there, as every where el&s;e, whatever ab&s;ence there might be of excellent poetry and fine conception in his pieces of this &s;tamp, tho&s;e de|ficencies were &s;o made up by di&s;po&s;ition and effect, that his judgment kept his reputation con&s;tantly afloat. Having premi&s;ed &s;o much, which certainly is but fair and candid, we &s;hall let his dramatic pieces &s;peak for them&s;elves, at the &s;ame time that they bring out &s;uch collateral circum&s;tances as may &s;erve to illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>It is plain that GARRICK had predetermined to
<PB N="136" REF="140">
become an author as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, under an idea that if bad acting could be defended by an able pen good acting might be celebrated even by an indif|ferent one. To manife&s;t, therefore, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble that &s;uch was his re&s;olution, he brought out the <HI>Lying Valet</HI> in 1741, the very &s;ea&s;on of his fir&s;t appear|ance in Goodman's Fields, in which, of cour&s;e, he performed the principal character. He has been ac|cu&s;ed of borrowing this piece from the French, and indeed Sharp has a family re&s;emblance of all the Scapins, and Cri&s;pins, and Frontins of that theatre; it is not, however, the likene&s;s of any one character but of the Valet, not only of FRANCE but of EN|GLAND, and every where el&s;e. He lies out of fidelity to his ma&s;ter, he is in love with the chambermaid of his ma&s;ter's mi&s;tre&s;s, and he is, in &s;hort, what every other convenient &s;ervant ever was and ever will be. This is only the vehicle. The piece it&s;elf appears to me to be original, and is, as far as it goes, a com|plete dramatic performance. It is full of plea&s;antry, intere&s;t, and effect, the writing is elevated enough for the purpo&s;e, and it has &s;ewer faults than many productions of much greater men. I &s;ay &s;o much becau&s;e I rather think that it is GARRICK's mo&s;t complete dramatic production, and this &s;hews that his mind was well made up to his profe&s;&s;ion at &s;tarting.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="141">Whether GARRICK's time was &s;o taken up in the &s;tudy and performance of that prodigious num|ber of parts of all de&s;criptions by which he ac|quired &s;o de&s;ervedly the highe&s;t reputation, or whe|ther he found any difficulty in keeping FLEETWOOD to a performance of his engagements, he did not bring out his next piece, which was <HI>Mi&s;s in her Teens,</HI> till the latter part of the &s;ea&s;on in which he was engaged with RICH. This piece had &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s that on the fifteenth night, a fact that I had both from RICH and GARRICK, when the author received the play bills, he found his name adverti&s;ed for a &s;econd benefit, without his previous know|ledge. RICH declared there was &s;o much merit in the piece, and it had done the theatre &s;o much &s;er|vice, that the compliment it&s;elf would not have been recompen&s;e enough without this manner of conveying it, and GARRICK &s;aid that he valued it only upon that account. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that RICH has &s;aid he would not have done this had he expected to have lo&s;t GARRICK, and GARRICK, though he was &s;truck with the gene|ro&s;ity of the action, never imitated it but once during his whole management. <HI>Mi&s;s in her Teens</HI> derived its be&s;t reputation from the performance of GARRICK and WOODWARD, in Fribble and

Fla&s;h. The piece it&s;elf is a &s;trong caracature, and therefore very little in nature.</P>
<P><HI>Lethe</HI> was the fir&s;t piece written by GARRICK, which was produced after he became manager of Drury Lane. It had made its appearance at the &s;ame theatre in 1740, but it was then a mere &s;ketch and &s;oon withdrawn. GARRICK has added the character of Lord Chalk&s;tone when he produced it in 1747, which he acted mo&s;t admirably. I cannot refrain from noticing that all the world have been deceived in the idea that this piece is taken from the French, and was originally called <HI>Les Eaux D'Oblivion,</HI> and I was my&s;elf in the error. I have however &s;earched every authority, and particularly a book where I have at one view every piece that ever came out at the French theatre from the Trouba|dours up to 1773, and there is no &s;uch piece to be found.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> which play has been repeat|edly altered on account of the &s;udden change in Romeo's love from Ro&s;aland to Juliet, and the ef|fect of the cata&s;trophe which was conceived to be in|complete, the propriety of which objections I have con&s;idered before, had &s;o much effect that it has ever &s;ince kept the &s;tage. GARRICK has touched
<PB N="139" REF="143">
SHAKESPEAR with much mode&s;ty and deference.

It had little effect; GARRICK &s;hould not have brought it out; it was &s;acrificing SHAKESPEAR to his own vanity. <HI>Florizel and Perdita</HI> was produced from a better motive. The two parts of the <HI>Winter's Tale</HI> can bear &s;epara|tion on account of the great di&s;tance of time. GAR|RICK pre&s;erved SHAKESPEAR.

<P><PB N="140" REF="144"><HI>Lilliput</HI> was performed in 1757. This was the wor&s;t of GARRICK's pieces. It had very little &s;uc|ce&s;s. It was performed by children. The <HI>Male Coquette,</HI> 1757. This piece was written at a very &s;hort warning for WOOWARD's benefit, and intended to ridicule a &s;pecies of men, or rather non-entities, who, though incapable of love, and in&s;en&s;ible of fe|male loveline&s;s, talk like LOTHARIO of beauty that they never &s;aw, and fancy raptures that they never felt. The character, however, was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting that as it involved an unmanly and &s;hocking idea with it, the public very properly revolted at it. <HI>Fribble</HI> was bad enough, but <HI>Dafodil</HI> was dete&s;table.</P>
<P>GARRICK altered The <HI>Game&s;ter</HI> from SHIRLEY in 1751. I have already explained the merit of of this alteration which is not &s;o judicious as the al|terations of GARRICK in general. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> is al|tered from SOUTHERN by leaving out the comic part, much to the advantage of the play. The <HI>Guardian,</HI> a comedy of two acts, performed in 1759, and written for the purpo&s;e of bringing forward Mi&s;s PRITCHARD, daughter to the celebrated actre&s;s of that name, is taken from the <HI>Pupile</HI> of FAGAN. The &s;ucce&s;s of Mademoi&s;elle GAUSSIN in this piece, who was complimented with ver&s;es out of number, induced GARRICK, perhaps, to hope that his <HI>Pupile</HI> would arrive at the &s;ame celebrity. He was, how|ever,
<PB N="141" REF="145">

<P>The <HI>Enchanter,</HI> a kind of opera. It was merely a pa&s;&s;able piece. The mu&s;ic was by SMITH; and LEONI, then a boy, appeared in it to great advan|tage. <HI>Cymbeline,</HI> in which GARRICK performed Po&s;thumous &s;o admirably, is of cour&s;e SHAKES|PEAR's play, who&s;e fame is certainly re&s;cued from HAWKINS, MARSH, BROOKS, and others, who had handled it too roughly. GARRICK, however, has &s;unk the conduct of the phy&s;ician, which accounts for the harmle&s;s potion &s;wallowed by Imogen, and therefore the piece is incomplete. The <HI>Farmer's Re|turn from London,</HI> was a temporary interlude written happily enough to ridicule the Cock Lane Gho&s;t, which at that time engro&s;&s;ed the talk of the town. This is the la&s;t production of GARRICK before his tour to ITALY. I &s;hall therefore examine other au|thors up to that time, a review of who&s;e works will bring out many collateral particulars relative to GARRICK.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. FOOTE, MACKLIN, AND MURPHY.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;hew how much the &s;tage was indebted to GARRICK as an actor, and how tran&s;cendantly ad|admirable his acting mu&s;t have been, he maintained that great rank in reputation he &s;o meritoriou&s;ly filled during twenty-two years without the advantage of performing original characters, except a very few, and tho&s;e were principally written by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As a proof of this, I cannot find during that period as many celebrated writers as I have often enumerated, in the cour&s;e of this work, within a given period of five or &s;ix years. In&s;tead, there|fore, of in&s;erting in the head of this chapter the names of &s;everal writers of dramatic fame, I am unable to di&s;cover more than FOOTE, MACKLIN, and MURPHY. What then could po&s;&s;ibly have kept the reputation of the theatre and brought it &s;tep by &s;tep to that bright fame it acquired, but the vigilance added to the tran&s;cendant merit of GARRICK, who
<PB N="143" REF="147">
ran&s;acked the hidden trea&s;ures of SHAKESPEAR, and his cotemporaries, brought them to view and gave them a poli&s;h by his exqui&s;ite acting. MAS|SINGER, in &s;ome degree, eclip&s;ed SHAKESPEAR, immediately before GARRICK.</P>
<P>FOOTE, an admirable but a mo&s;t mi&s;chievous writer, who emulated ARISTOPHANES with le&s;s ge|nius and le&s;s feeling, who &s;eemed fondly to fancy that to torture individuals was the only way to de|light their fellow creatures, mea&s;uring their plea&s;ure by his malignity, who knew no quality of &s;atire but per&s;onality, who would &s;acrifice his be&s;t friend for the gratification of tormenting him, and who, after all was perpetually the cats paw to his own vanity, created, among the fa&s;tidious, the &s;our, and the heart burnt, a &s;ort of veneration for that exotic from GREECE the middle comedy, which greatly to the honour of the manly and benevolent character of the Engli&s;h, may have a dwindling and a rickety exi&s;tence, but can never flouri&s;h to maturity in this country.</P>
<P>Who cares now for any thing that CHURCHILL wrote? The topic of the day kept the world a tip toe for every new libel in which public men were branded with the accu&s;ation of public crimes to lift
<PB N="144" REF="148">
into notice private profligates and apo&s;tates. Had &s;uch talents, for they were certainly eminent, been employed in general &s;atire, which, by admoni&s;hing all, corrects many, and privately induces amendment by conviction. CHURCHILL would have lived in out minds. Now he is forgotten. Common nature is often ab&s;urd, but it is never mon&s;trous. An inde|lible &s;tain upon the reputation of DRYDEN, and of POPE, was cau&s;ed by <HI>Mac Flecknoc,</HI> and the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> FOOTE, like CHURCHILL, was &s;tained in this man|ner all over, and would have been at this moment as fa&s;t, for neither of them can ever be peaceably, a&s;leep, if it were not for an attempt now and then to revive his pieces, which, however, their malice be|ing defeated, have now but little attraction.</P>
<P>There is another thing which naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf on an examination of the&s;e Drawcan&s;irs, the&s;e dealers in fiats, who expect the world to pay an impli|cit obedience, not to their opinions, for I will not be &s;o uncharitable as to believe they always think what they write, but to their a&s;&s;ertions, and this is, that, upon the principal that all critics ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s in their own minds a certificate of their ability to write as well as tho&s;e authors they critici&s;e, &s;o the minds of all moral menders ought to be moral.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="149">As the dramatic pieces of FOOTE will bring out various ob&s;ervations naturally connected with them, I &s;hall now proceed to their examination. <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI> This piece was produced in 1752, at which time FOOTE was in that pro&s;perity which rendered it needle&s;s to write for profit. He therefore gave all the emoluments to the celebrated JEMMY WORSDALE, the very per&s;on who took. POPE's ma|nu&s;cript letters to CURL. It did not however greatly &s;ucceed. It was intended to ridicule generally an ab&s;urd pa&s;&s;ion for virt&ucirc;, but it was &s;o confined to the great, who are too callous to feel attacks of this kind, that it was no further u&s;eful to the au|thor's reputation than to &s;hew that he could write, and that he was capable of attacking whatever might be the reigning folly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;hman in Paris,</HI> 1758, is a farce of con|&s;iderable merit. The characters are natural, the plot is intere&s;ting, and the drift is laudable. Had FOOTE uniformly kept to this &s;pecies of writing, he would certainly have e&s;tabli&s;hed a legitimate repu|tation. In his next piece, The <HI>Knights,</HI> he began to indulge his favourite propen&s;ity by per&s;onating a peculiar character whom he had the &s;upreme felicity of rendering ridiculous in his neighbourhood, where till then he had been re&s;pected and beloved, and
<PB N="146" REF="150">
had never, till the exhibition of this exaggerated portrait, been &s;u&s;pected of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any follies but what were perfectly harmle&s;s and innofen&s;ive and in common with tho&s;e of his neighbours and friends.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;hman returned from Paris,</HI> is a piece of a better kind. It is general and has good di&s;|crimination. It is al&s;o remarkable for a peculiar neat diction that FOOTE had a good knack of writing. He had, however, perpetually the contrary fault, and having filled his head with that &s;hort re&s;pon&s;ive dialogue, which, though tierce enough in the French, is flat and palling on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, the ear was in his pieces too frequently tired with, <Q REND="inline">"certainly, no doubt, granted",</Q> and a long &s;tring of other &s;imilar expre&s;&s;ions which are repeated almo&s;t verbatim in every one of his plays.</P>
<P>The <HI>Author,</HI> one of FOOTE's outragious per&s;on|alities, was performed at Drury Lane in 1757. The gentleman mimicked in this piece and held up by FOOTE as an object for the hand of &s;corn to point its &s;low and moving ringer at was a per&s;on of fortune not in any re&s;pect de&s;erving of public or private reprehen&s;ion for any breach of honour, li|berality, or moral rectitude, but becau&s;e he hap|pened
<PB N="147" REF="151">
to have pecularities. It would have been more to the honour of the &s;atiri&s;t if his own pecu|larities had been as little liable to reproach. The gentleman alluded to had intere&s;t enough to get the piece &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The <HI>Diver&s;ions of the Morning</HI> was compo&s;ed of <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and other things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minor</HI> was performed in 1760. This piece is full of per&s;onalities. We here begin to &s;ee in FOOTE a mixture of SHADWELL and FIELDING; from the fir&s;t he had plenty of opportunity to take his bullies, and his bawds, and, if the latter ridiculed COCK, the auctioneer, FOOTE had nothing to do but retail the &s;ame materials in order to repre&s;ent COCK's &s;ucce&s;&s;or LANGFORD.</P>
<P>The drift of this piece, which it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed is laudable enough, might have been brought about without any of the&s;e reprehen&s;ibles vehi|cles. Profligacy, impo&s;ition, and hypocri&s;y are the proper objects of ridicule for the theatre; but why are particular characters held up as the only promulgators of the&s;e evils? If the hydra vice is to be de&s;troyed by &s;triking at a &s;ingle bawd, a &s;ingle auctioneer, and a &s;ingle methodi&s;t, then is the la|bour no longer Herculean,</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="152">Every body knows that this was not the fact. Mother DOUGLAS, LANGFORD, and WHITEFIELD were laughed at, but wenching, tricking, and pray|ing went on as before; and thus general reproba|tion was lo&s;t in per&s;onal ridicule, and the &s;everity of the &s;atiri&s;t eclip&s;ed by the adroitne&s;s of the mimic</P>
<P>The <HI>Orators,</HI> performed at the Haymarket in 1762, is a kind of acted illu&s;tration of the principles of oratory. It contains as u&s;ual many per&s;onalities, and was rendered celebrated by FOOTE's mimicking a well known Dublin printer, who had but one leg. The &s;atiri&s;t little dreamt at that time that the per|&s;onal defect, at lea&s;t which he thought proper to ex|po&s;e to laughter, would one day be his own. The printer, when he caught him upon his own ground, trounced him &s;everely; a Dublin jury not being of opinion that natural infirmities ought to be quietly &s;ported with. Upon this occa&s;ion FOOTE wrote a Prologue in which he mode&s;tly procured him&s;elf to be called the Engli&s;h ARISTOPHANES.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mayor of Garrat,</HI> performed in 1763, is ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed to be in every re&s;pect original. This, however, is not true, as any one may be con|vinced who chu&s;es to look at SHADWELL's <HI>Ep&s;om Wells,</HI> where they will find Major Sturgeon, Jerry
<PB N="149" REF="153">
Sneak, Bruin, and the two wives. The Major, who every body knew, talked of mu&s;tering up courage enough to cane the poet. No body would have been &s;orry if he had kept his word. The&s;e are all FOOTE's pieces within my pre&s;ent promi&s;e.</P>
<P>MACKLIN, who&s;e writing was as har&s;h and as hard as his conduct was rude and dogmatic, who, though he did not produce many pieces, contrived to make one an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of many, who&s;e &s;trange pecularities made him a torment to him&s;elf and to every body el&s;e, was, however, a u&s;eful and &s;ometimes a great actor, and very far from an in|ferior author.</P>
<P>MACKLIN's fir&s;t piece was <HI>Henry the Seventh, or the Popi&s;h Impo&s;tor.</HI> It appeared at Drury Lane the year that GARRICK performed at Covent Gar|den. The &s;econd title of this piece is a mi&s;nomer, for the &s;tory is that of <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> which we have &s;een treated un&s;ucce&s;sfully before, and a man could not be &s;aid to be an impo&s;tor by profe&s;&s;ing the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. It was, however, in every re&s;pect faulty and univer&s;ally rejected. MACK|LIN's friends are &s;olicitous to retrieve his fame by the &s;tale excu&s;e that it was done in a hurry, to which they add that his employment as manager prevented him
<PB N="150" REF="154">
from paying it the private attention it ought to have received. In the fir&s;t place, if he did not take time enough he ought to have found more, and in the &s;econd, he was not manager in that year, LACEY be|ing then in that capacity and proprietor as we have &s;een with GREEN and AMBER.</P>
<P><HI>A Will or no Will</HI> has been frequently acted for MACKLIN's benefit but never was con&s;idered of con&s;equence enough to be regularly brought for|ward. The <HI>Su&s;picious Hu&s;band Critized,</HI> is of cour&s;e an invidious thing. The play it was meant to ridi|cule &s;tanding de&s;ervedly high in the public opinion. It had but little &s;ucce&s;s, yet more than it merited. The <HI>Fortune Hunters</HI> never was performed ex|cept three or four different times at the author's benefits. <HI>Covent Garden Theatre, or Peter Pa&s;quin turned Drawcan&s;ir.</HI> Up to this period we find MACKLIN nothing more than an imitator of FIELD|ING. His performances were temporary, and prin|cipally a ridicule on theatres and plays, naturally poor and unprofitable to the fame of an author.</P>
<P><HI>Love Alamode</HI> was performed at Drury Lane in 1760. This piece, though heaven knows it has no &s;uperior traits of genius or talents, made the author a little fortune. When it came out, it was &s;trongly
<PB N="151" REF="155">
&s;upported and &s;trongly oppo&s;ed. Its partizans, how|ever, at length got the better, and this victory gave the farce an admitted con&s;eqenee it certainly did not critically de&s;erve. The &s;tory has been fifty times gone over, and the denouement has always been the &s;ame in fact, though never &s;o bad in effect as in <HI>Love Alamode.</HI> To made a needy Iri&s;hman the only di&s;|intere&s;ted lover of a lady apparently without fortune is certainly a little too much upon the brogue, e&s;pe|cially when this Iri&s;hman is the nephew of the lady's guardian, who would certainly, both naturally and theatrically &s;peaking, have let him into the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>This farce, owing to a number of adventitious circum&s;tances, had great &s;ucce&s;s, and this created a report, naturally enough, that MACKLIN was not the author of it, which, according to cu&s;tom, though every body knew the contrary, was at one time pretty generally believed. The report it&s;elf is not &s;o extraordinary as that with all his &s;ourne&s;s and irra&s;cibility he had the good &s;en&s;e to treat it with contempt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Married Libertine</HI> was performed at Covent Garden in 1761. It was very &s;trongly oppo&s;ed dur|ing its run, which was no more than nine nights. The conte&s;t relative to this play was like that which
<PB N="152" REF="156">
di&s;tingui&s;hed <HI>Love Alamode.</HI> It did not, however, terminate &s;o fortunately. The author was as &s;tre|niou&s;ly &s;upported by his countrymen, who remem|bered their triumph in favour of Little Ireland and Sir Callaghan, but the merits were univer&s;ally al|lowed not to bear them out; the di&s;tinction, how|ever, was not correct. As FOOTE's characters were notoriou&s;ly held out to ridicule &s;ome per&s;on well known, &s;o the public gave MACKLIN the credit, or rather the obloquy, of intending by his &s;ome per&s;on the idea of whom had never entered his imagination, and thus, as the &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;onification of Lord BUTE had created a ho&s;t of friends and enemies in Sir Archy, &s;o here the character of Lord Bellevile was &s;uppo&s;ed to imply a married nobleman who&s;e intrigues at that time were pretty notorious. The <HI>Married Libertine</HI> has never &s;ince been re&s;umed, though it certainly had more merit than <HI>Love Ala Mode.</HI></P>
<P>MURPHY, an author of merited celebrity, who has written tragedy, comedy, and farce, with fair and legitimate pretendons to fame, an extent of dramatic talents very rarely concentrated in one wri|ter, comes next into con&s;ideration, and I am plea&s;ed to acknowledge that the repugnance naturally ari&s;ing from an unwillingne&s;s to give pain to living authors
<PB N="153" REF="157">
will in this in&s;tance yield to the plea&s;ure of record|ing truth and prai&s;e in the &s;ame delineation.</P>
<P>With the different pur&s;uits of Mr. MURPHY I have nothing to do. Biographers of the living have at be&s;t an awkward ta&s;k to perform, and it is there|fore &s;eldom attempted with &s;ucce&s;s but by the il|liberal and the malignant, who are as &s;ure to find readers in tho&s;e who&s;e minds are congenial to their own as they are to be &s;purned and execrated by men of candour, genero&s;ity, and judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. MURPHY was intended for bu&s;ine&s;s, has been a party man, was an actor, a dramatic writer, and at length a barri&s;ter, about which a great deal has been &s;aid; but how any part of it can, as fact, tell to his di&s;advantage is beyond the admi&s;&s;ion of my ca|pacity. All profe&s;&s;ions are honourable, if they are honourably borne; but the <HI>ip&s;e dixits</HI> of CHURCHIL have found their low and dirty level, and it would be well for the &s;ocieties of the Inns of Court if they never had admitted among them men who&s;e pur|&s;uits had been more di&s;honourable than tho&s;e who have followed the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor.</P>
<P>MURPHY's fir&s;t piece was the <HI>Apprentice,</HI> 1756, a farce &s;o well known and &s;o generally approved
<PB N="154" REF="158">
that every reader can anticipate a de&s;cription of it. I &s;hall, therefore, &s;ay that, being his fir&s;t attempt, it gave good proof of that coming dramatic reputa|tion which this author has &s;o ably e&s;tabli&s;hed. The <HI>Spouter, or the Triple Revenge,</HI> is a &s;trange piece in which GARRICK, RICH, and young CIBBER, con|nived at being ridiculed. It &s;eems to have been one of tho&s;e left handed whims of GARRICK, like The <HI>Sick Monkey,</HI> to anticipate ridicule, which, per|haps, would never have been conceived but in his own imagination. It had no &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Engli&s;h|man from Paris,</HI> which was performed in 1756 only a &s;ingle night, and to which MURPHY &s;poke the Pro|logue, was, of cour&s;e, the &s;ubject of FOOTE's <HI>En|gli&s;hman returned from Paris,</HI> to which latter the town gave the preference.</P>
<P>The <HI>Uphol&s;terer.</HI> This piece, which has been &s;o long and &s;o de&s;ervedly a favourite, was originally performed for MOSSOP's benefit, but was found to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much merit that the managers very gladly admitted it among their &s;tock performances. The hint is taken from the <HI>Spectator,</HI> and is mo&s;t com|pletely to the very purpo&s;e of farce; a di&s;crimina|tion which was peculiarly the talent of MURPHY.</P>
<P>We now come to this author's fir&s;t tragedy, which was The <HI>Orphan of China.</HI> The original &s;tory
<PB N="155" REF="159">
of this play is to be met with in DU HALDE's Hi&s;tory of China, which VOLTAIRE had wrought into a tra|gedy, and of which I have already &s;poken. MUR|PHY's play is an alteration of VOLTAIRE, with an eye, perhaps, to the <HI>Heraclius</HI> of CORNEILLE. It was certainly judicious to bring forward the Orphan and make him a principal character in the piece, but it has given it, therefore, a re&s;emblance to <HI>Merope,</HI> and tho&s;e numerous tragedies of the &s;ame complexion.</P>
<P>This piece, notwith&s;tanding GARRICK's incom|parable acting, and the opportunity it gave of di&s;|playing the valuable merits of Mrs. YATES, and other adventitious circum&s;tances, did not certainly &s;ucceed to the degree its merits had promi&s;ed, for which a variety of rea&s;ons have been given, and one of them of a curious and private nature relative to a pique taken ab&s;urdly by GARRICK, in con&s;equence of a political tran&s;action but I apprehend it princi|pally aro&s;e, for the&s;e circum&s;tances are generally ea&s;ily traceable, from this play being con&s;idered a &s;ort of innovation on tragedy, and con&s;i&s;ting of pomp|ous and poetic, rather than affecting and intere&s;ting language, and depicting great rather than natural manners. There may be too much truth in this la&s;t
<PB N="156" REF="160">
ob&s;ervation, and perhaps it obtains too generally in MURPHY, but the opportunities this has given to call forth great and tran&s;cendant powers in actors have made ample amends, as far as it re&s;pects the general advantage of the theatre, no dramatic author, in our recollection, having given additional lu&s;tre to the merits of more various and eminent performers.</P>
<P>The <HI>De&s;art I&s;land,</HI> 1760. This piece, which is taken from <HI>Meta&s;ta&s;io,</HI> is better written, that is to &s;ay with more nature, than this author's &s;erious pieces in general. It is, however, too barren of incident. The <HI>Way to Keep Him</HI> accompanied this piece; they were each written in three acts and intended to make up the &s;ame evening's entertainment, a mode of introduction that has &s;eldom &s;ucceeded. The <HI>De|&s;ert I&s;land</HI> was &s;oon withdrawn, and the author, by adding two acts to The <HI>Way to Keep Him,</HI> gave it a permanent right to keep the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Way to Keep Him</HI> is certainly a play of con|&s;iderable merit; its bent and drift are truly prai&s;e worthy, and it is in many re&s;pects a kind of improve|ment upon CIBBER. It is curious to remark that the critics decided, when it was performed in three acts, that it was imperfect; and, when it was extend|ed to five, that the addition had &s;poiled a perfect
<PB N="157" REF="161">
piece. The new character of Sir Ba&s;hful Con&s;tant, was al&s;o &s;ettled both to be totally out of nature and to be the actual portrait of a per&s;on then living. That Sir Ba&s;hful is not out of nature will, I believe, be ea&s;ily granted, and as to the other a&s;&s;ertion, it cannot be truth, unle&s;s the per&s;on alluded to was both an Engli&s;hman and a native of France, for the character and a good deal of the conduct are taken from a play of LA CHAUSSEE.</P>
<P><HI>All in the Wrong</HI> was brought out in 1761, at Drury Lane, during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, at which time FOOTE, MURPHY, and YATES, had the theatre to them&s;elves, a plan, which GARRICK well knew would come to nothing, and that he &s;hould get the pieces then produced upon ea&s;y terms, &s;everal of which were intended to have been brought forward. None however, was actually produced, except tho&s;e of MURPHY, and one written by BENTLEY, which we &s;hall &s;ee in its place called The <HI>Wi&s;hes, or Harle|quin's Mouth Opened.</HI></P>
<P>MURPHY was a mo&s;t powerful ally in this con|federacy. <HI>All in the Wrong,</HI> a play which has been long a de&s;erving favourite, had in it as much of &s;tage bu&s;tle and perplexity as any piece that ever ap|peared; and, as it was intended to ridicule a na|tural

though ab&s;urd pa&s;&s;ion at all points, and in every po&s;&s;ible view, it certainly exhibited a mo&s;t happy combination of circum&s;tances by no means too &s;trong, for what is there extravagant that jealou&s;y will not fancy, and gave that inveterate folly a vio|lent correction which alone can ma&s;ter its own irratibility.</P>
<P>If the knot of circum&s;tances in <HI>All in the Wrong</HI> had been as ingeniou&s;ly untied as it was knit together, no candid critic could have found in it any thing to caval at. As to the objection that has been generally made to MURPHY's comedies, that they have not the wit of CONGRIEVE and VANBRUGH, the an|is that they have then more nature, for indeed quib|ble and point is not the common language of man|kind, and in particular when the pa&s;&s;ions are bu&s;ily at work it is a &s;tronger proof of nature to con&s;ult the heart, than the head; from one the language comes mea&s;ured and cold, from the other intuitive and animated.</P>
<P>The <HI>Old Maid</HI> was performed the &s;ame &s;ummer. It contains a &s;eries of plea&s;ant circum&s;tances occa|&s;ioned by a &s;imple and natural equivoque, a mode of conveying comic humour of the be&s;t kind when it is rationally treated, but of the mo&s;t mon&s;trous
<PB N="159" REF="163">
and burle&s;que when violently caricatured. The &s;tage is too much a &s;tranger to this &s;pecies of after-piece. Every thing in The <HI>Old Maid</HI> is ju&s;t, happy, full of effect, and managed with a nice and pene|trating di&s;crimination that are highly creditable to the author; upon the whole there is &s;carcely any piece upon the &s;tage more perfect in its way. The re&s;emblance it bears to <HI>L'Etourderie,</HI> of FAGAN, is only that fair advantage of which every author has a right to a avail him&s;elf,</P>
<P>The <HI>Citizen,</HI> which was al&s;o performed in the &s;ummer of 1761, and which brought Mi&s;s ELLIOT on the &s;tage, has proved of con&s;iderable value to the theatre. Nothing is more &s;en&s;ible or more meritorious in managers than to &s;trengthen their in|tere&s;t as to the half price. MURPHY was admirably well calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t the theatre in this particular. When WOODWARD came from IRELAND, The <HI>Citizen,</HI> The <HI>Uphol&s;terer,</HI> and The <HI>Apprentice,</HI> brought at half price a mo&s;t incredible &s;um for at lea&s;t three years, and no trifle for &s;everal years afterwards</P>
<P>The <HI>Citizen</HI> was well calculated to di&s;play the various merit of Mi&s;s ELLIOT, who certainly per|formed Maria incomparably; and, though there is
<PB N="160" REF="164">
&s;ome extravagance in the conduct, the drift is laud|able, and the circum&s;tances are natural. The &s;cene which the author pretends to cover by giving an idea that it is an imitation of <HI>Rule a Wife and Have a Wife,</HI> is The <HI>Fau&s;&s;e Agnes</HI> of DESTOUCHES, even to the <HI>oui Mon&s;ieur,</HI> which has always &s;o good an effect. There is, however, no harm in this. Every author has a right to imitate whatever he is capable of improving.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. YOUNG, MALLET, DODSLEY, BROOKE, WILLIAM SHIRLEY, AND OTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE works of the authors now under con&s;ideration do not by any means militate again&s;t my declaration as to the incon&s;iderable number of celebrated dra|matic pieces during the fir&s;t &s;ixteen years of GAR|RIK's reign, mo&s;t of their productions, as will ap|pear, having &s;een the world before the year 1741; but, as part of them were brought forward after that period, I thought it be&s;t to give the whole in one view.</P>
<P>YOUNG, who&s;e great character was &s;ingularity, who &s;eems in the cour&s;e of his life to have been con&s;tant to all the virtues and vices, and like Cap|tain PLUME with his fifteen attachments never me|lancholy for one, who&s;e writings are in places trite and in others &s;ublime, who had great natural requi|&s;ites, but who &s;eems ambitious to be con&s;idered more as an uncommon than an origiginal poet, wrote
<PB N="162" REF="166">
three tragedies, one of which is well known to the public.</P>
<P><HI>Bu&s;iris</HI> 1719, like mo&s;t of YOUNG's works is an original conception of its author, who &s;eems every where to have introduced characters which he knew from the beginning he &s;hould not know how to di&s;|po&s;e of at la&s;t, and, therefore, he calls in the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a dagger to get rid of them. <HI>Bu&s;iris</HI> is high and &s;ounding, but has no means of acce&s;s to the heart.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revenge</HI> is well known, becau&s;e it has been by &s;ome con&s;idered as an improvement on <HI>Othello,</HI> Zanga's revenge being held up as more natural and more equitable than that of Iago; but this would be to make a virtue of revenge and to tolerate murder. It is ridiculous to compare the probable or the moral propriety of the two pieces upon this point. Othello tru&s;ts a man whom he had loaded with benefits, and on who&s;e gratitude he has every right to repo&s;e. Alonzo confides his &s;oul to a proud African Prince, his &s;lave, who&s;e nature he mu&s;t know, if he knew any thing, was vindictive malignity; and as if it was not enough to &s;ubmit his &s;en&s;es to the controul of &s;uch a mind, he does all this with his eyes open, for he is con&s;cious of having dealt this gloomy and im|placable
<PB N="163" REF="167">
Moor a blow, which indelible &s;tain and di&s;|grace he would infallibly wipe off with his blood, after having reproached him with his folly and weak|ne&s;s in having li&s;tened to him.</P>
<P>As to the cau&s;es of jealou&s;y they are infinitely pre-eminent on the &s;ide of SHAKESPEAR, who&s;e trifles, light as air, blind &s;u&s;picion, while forged let|ters, pictures, and &s;uch gro&s;s and palpable evidence would detect the villain in the mind of any man above an idiot, and a driveller. In &s;hort, the plot cannot be defended except by tho&s;e who are mad enough to maintain that a family ought to be de&s;|troyed for a fancied injury, that the revenge of Zanga, which &s;uper&s;edes law, ju&s;tice, and morality, may be tolerated, and that the folly and &s;tupidity of Alonzo de&s;erves an exemplary puni&s;hment. There are certainly pa&s;&s;ages of con&s;iderable merit in the play; for, whoever YOUNG has imitated, the writ|ing is his own, which it is too little to &s;ay is greatly above Mrs. BEHN, and it would be too much to &s;ay that it is any thing equal to SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P>Of the tragedy of The <HI>Brothers,</HI> Dr. JOHNSON tells us the world has &s;aid nothing, and therefore he may be allowed the &s;ame indulgence. One author
<PB N="164" REF="168">
has, however, &s;aid a great deal of it; and, after go|ing into an elaborate and general account of its me|rits, he tries to prove his a&s;&s;ertion by &s;aying that the author nobly gave up the profits for the propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts. YOUNG has been &s;aid to have written with the energy of DRYDEN, but the only re&s;emblance between them &s;eems to be, that YOUNG dedicated the <HI>Revenge</HI> to the infamous WHARTON, and DRYDEN his <HI>Marriage ala Mode</HI> to WHARTON's infamous relation ROCHESTER.</P>
<P>MALLET, a writer with more cunning than ge|nius, who courted the great to better purpo&s;es than authors in general are able to do, and whom JOHN|SON has, meanly for him&s;elf, &s;tigmatized in his Dic|tionary in his etymology of the word alias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This curious in&s;tance of deliberate malevolence ought be no|ticed. JOHNSON and MALLET were together looking at the wild bea&s;ts in the Tower, and MALLET ob&s;erved, as they were noticing the uncouthne&s;s of a Greenland bear, that it had &s;trong re&s;emblance to JOHNSON, remarking dryly that he did not know which was the hand&s;ome&s;t, the bear or the doctor. JOHNSON did not chu&s;e to re|&s;ent the matter upon the &s;pot, but laid up this injury in his mind, with a determination to take public revenge. Accordingly, when he compiled his Dictionary, having occa&s;ion to explain the etymology of the term <HI>alias,</HI> he gives it the following con&s;truction. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved that MALLET's real name was MALLOOH, and the doctor, of cour&s;e, concluded that he had &s;ome particular rea&s;on for concealing it. <Q REND="inline">"Alias,"</Q> &s;ays he,

<P><HI>Euridice</HI> is a weak tragedy and never had repu+table &s;ucce&s;s, though &s;trengthened by the perform|ance of GARRICK and Mrs. CIBBER, when it was revived in 1760. It originally appeared in 1731. <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> a &s;ubject treated before by Lord ORRERY and Lord BROOK, was probably written by MAL|LET to &s;hew his attention to noble writers.

<P><PB N="166" REF="170"><HI>Britannia,</HI> in which there is &s;ome charming mu|&s;ic by ARNE, had good &s;ucce&s;s, chiefly owing, how|ever to a prologue that GARRICK &s;poke in the cha|racter of a drunken &s;ailor. <HI>Elvira,</HI> 1763. This is MALLET's be&s;t dramatic production, but it had lit|tle &s;ucce&s;s notwith&s;tanding GARRICK, whom MAL|LET &s;eems to have known how to manage, did his utmo&s;t for it. It however contained unpopular &s;en|timents and could not re&s;i&s;t the oppo&s;ition that was made to it.</P>
<P>DODSLEY, who by his indu&s;try and his ingenuity was of great u&s;e to the cau&s;e of the theatre, and in|deed of literature in general, and who by his mode&s;ty and good &s;en&s;e pre&s;erved a re&s;pectable reputation, and accompli&s;hed the difficult ta&s;k of conciliating the favour of many friends, wrote the following pieces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Toy&s;hop,</HI> which is one of tho&s;e various dramas that have originated from RANDOLPH's <HI>Mu&s;es Looking Gla&s;s,</HI> and which good naturedly re|bukes fa&s;hionable follies.

The <HI>King and the Miller of Mansfield,</HI> a plea&s;ant and well known farce, which was afterwards tran&s;lated into French by SEDAINE,

the mu&s;ic by MONSIGNY, with mo&s;t extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s, is founded on a traditional &s;tory in the reign of HENRY the &s;econd. It has ever been de|&s;ervedly a favourite. <HI>Sir John Cockle at Court,</HI> al&s;o has merit but has the di&s;advantage of all &s;equels. The circum&s;tance, however, of making a man of plain integrity re&s;i&s;t the corruption of a court is cer|tainly a fair object for a dramatic pen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green</HI> is an un|happy &s;ubject. It did not &s;ucceed. <HI>Rex et Pon&s;ifex</HI> is only known in a volume ef DODSLEY's works modle&s;tly called <HI>Trifles. Cleone,</HI> is a tragedy of &s;ome merit. It had great &s;ucce&s;s which was principally owing, however, to the acting of Mrs. BELLAMY, who certainly was never in any other character &s;o excellent. It is, however unaffected, and pathetic, and the intere&s;t is in many places &s;trong and home to the heart.</P>
<P>BROOKE, who was a re&s;pectable though by no means a fir&s;t rate author, wrote fifteen dramatic pieces generally with indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. In his writings is diffu&s;ed a turbulent &s;pirit of liberty, which may &s;erve party purpo&s;es, but ought not to pervade theatrical productions. <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a</HI> was prohibited, but a &s;ub&s;cription of a thou&s;and pounds
<PB N="168" REF="172">
made the author amends. The piece was afterwards performed on the Iri&s;h &s;tage with alterations. The <HI>Earl of We&s;tmoreland</HI> was performed in IRELAND with &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Jack the Giant Queller</HI> was interdicted, though performed in IRELAND.</P>
<P>The <HI>Earl of E&s;&s;ex</HI> is well written in places, but the public gave the preference to the play of BANKS on this &s;ubject for the rea&s;ons we have already &s;een<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This play would &s;carcely be known but for a &s;trange thing &s;aid by Dr. JOHNSON about it, which without examination pa&s;&s;ed &s;o implicitly for &s;terling rea&s;on, that even the author con&s;ented to alter the line which is reprobated by the remark. JOHNSON is &s;aid to have been &s;olicitous to have a &s;pecimen of BROOKE's language, and Mr. SHERIDAN repeated to him the line at the end of the fir&s;t act which runs thus,
<Q><L>Who rule o'er freemen &s;hould them&s;elves be free.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Doctor's an&s;wer was that it would be as proper to &s;ay,
<Q><L>Who drives fat oxen &s;hould him&s;elf be fat.</L></Q></P>
<P>Than which nothing can be more fal&s;e, either literally or figura|tively. It &s;o happens that nothing can be better or more ju&s;t than the &s;entiment of BROOKE, though perhaps bunglingly expre&s;&s;ed. He alone is proper to rule over freemen who in his heart feels and cheri&s;hes the principles of freedom. What is there ami&s;s in the clear and obvious truth this conveys? Were this principle of argument carried on in the &s;entiment of JOHNSON it would mean, if it were in|tended to mean any thing, that the drover mu&s;t not only be corpulent which would be an impediment to his driving oxen, but fit for killing, which is a quality nece&s;&s;ary in the oxen, but not in the drover, be|cau&s;e men eat oxen, but not drovers. Nay, it is fal&s;e, &s;ift it how you may. The original po&s;ition is wrong. Freemen may be ruled and led, but they cannot be driven; but it would be folly to pur&s;ue it any further. I &s;hall therefore only add that this was one of tho&s;e in&s;tances in which JOHNSON found it ea&s;ier to knock down his auditors than to convince them.</P></NOTE>.

<P>WILLIAM SHIRLEY, an excellent calculator, except as to the merit of dramatic productions, wrote a &s;tring of pieces, the reception of which tolerably well proves my a&s;&s;ertion. The <HI>Paricide</HI> was performed once and unde&s;ervedly damned, if we may credit the author's dedication of it to RICH. <HI>King Pepin's Campaign,</HI> was &s;hort and un&s;ucce&s;sful. <HI>Ed|ward the Black Prince,</HI> an awkward attempt at an imi|tation of SHAKESPEAR, was the third misfortune that befel this author on his dramatic road. <HI>Electra</HI> was as unfortunate an imitation of SOPHOCLES as <HI>Ed|ward</HI> had been of SHAKESPEAR.

<P>DR. BENJAMIN HOADLY, the elde&s;t &s;on of the cele|brated bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, was a phy&s;ician of con|&s;iderable eminence, and, in addition to other inge|nious productions, wrote the well known and greatly admired comedy of The <HI>Su&s;picious Hu&s;band.</HI> This was one of the fir&s;t novelties that GARRICK brought out after he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the management. It certainly has great intrin&s;ic merit as every body knows; much of which, however, was owing to GAR|RICK's judicious advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance during its pre|paration for the &s;tage, which he gave very hone&s;tly, and which was permitted with even deference by HOADLY; who, admirable as he was in his various writings upon grave &s;ubjects, found great judgment and knowledge in the alterations made by his friend, who in particular modelled Ranger to his own man|ner, and afterwards performed it incomparably.</P>

He delighted in the theatre though an exemplary divine, and, though he knew how to treat &s;erious &s;ubjects with proper &s;trength of under&s;tanding and due &s;olemnity, he loved a je&s;t in his &s;oul His wit, however, was of the be&s;t kind; for, though it was irre&s;i&s;table, it never gave a moment's pain on reflection to him or his hearers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Contra&s;t</HI> was written by the Chancellor, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brother BENJAMIN, indeed they &s;eldom wrote upon any &s;ubject without con&s;ulting each other.

HOAD|LY would have written other pieces for the &s;tage if he had not been re&s;trained by the entreaties of his father, who with great paternal regard had &s;tudied to make his means honourable and ample. He dabbled, however, a great deal in private, and, among other efforts, he revi&s;ed LILLO's <HI>Arden of Fever&s;ham,</HI> wrote a tragedy called <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and planned a farce called The <HI>Hou&s;ekeeper,</HI> on the &s;ub|ject of <HI>High Life below Stairs,</HI> &s;omething relative to which I privately know; but, as much of my know|ledge of the &s;tage during the &s;even years I was ar|ticled to GARRICK, is derived from confidential conver&s;ation, it would be a weak way of recom|mending one &s;pecies of veracity by violating an|other.

<P>The <HI>School for Lovers,</HI> though a re&s;pectable play came out to di&s;advantage after The <HI>Guardian.</HI> It was one of the fir&s;t attempts at what was called &s;en|timental comedy, which the French under the term <HI>drame</HI> have cla&s;&s;ed as &s;uperior in a moral &s;en&s;e to either tragedy or comedy; In ENGLAND it at la&s;t became a mere rhap&s;ody of words. The play in que&s;tion is by no means of this outragious &s;pecies; it is delicate, &s;en&s;ible, and to a degree impre&s;&s;ive, but neither the &s;ituations nor the intere&s;t was found &s;ufficiently powerful, notwith&s;tanding it was admira|bly acted, to en&s;ure it permanence. The <HI>Trip to Scotland</HI> was a pa&s;&s;able farce and that was all. WHITEHEAD could not write ill but his attempts at comedy are rather &s;ketches than pictures.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="181">JOHNSON, who has written &s;o many volumes him|&s;elf, and filled &s;o many volumes written by others, can only have a very &s;mall corner in this work, becau&s;e he wrote but one play, and that an un&s;ucce&s;sful one. I could with no great difficulty go largely into his literary character which I might be tempted to do were I not under an incumbent nece&s;&s;ity of paying impartial attention to all tho&s;e of whom I have un|dertaken to &s;peak. The reflections re&s;ulting from this forbearance perhaps are plea&s;urable, for it is inconceivable how like the bundle of ru&s;hes he &s;inks more and more into in&s;ignificance upon our nearer acquaintance.</P>
<P><HI>Irene,</HI> the only play of JOHNSON, was per|formed by GARRICK, BARRY, Mrs. CIBBER, Mrs. PRITCHARD, and all the &s;trength of the company, and yet excited no extraordinary curio&s;ity, or at|tracted any warmth of applau&s;e; for which the public ta&s;te has been arrogantly arrainged by the cri|tics, though no dramatic piece was ever u&s;hered into the world with more &s;upport and patronage. In &s;hort it was regular to preci&s;ene&s;s, and verbo&s;e to dullne&s;s; and, what with the mixture of SENECA and ARISTOTLE that pervaded it, neither the critics, the author, or the actors could per&s;uade the public that there can be any mode of delight and enjoy|ment

<P>MOORE, who knew how to feel as he wrote, the tendency of all who&s;e productions was to cultivate truth and morality, and who, therefore, found it difficult to become a fa&s;hionable writer, brought out two comedies and a tragedy. The <HI>Foundling</HI> is a play of &s;terling merit. It breathes a good deal the air of MERCIER. It has, however, an unfortunate re&s;emblance to The <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers</HI> in the principal drift of the plot, and therefore, though it has been often performed, and always with applau&s;e, yet it yields to STEELE's play what has certainly &s;uperior merit. This play was produced in 1748. In 1751 he brought out <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> which GARRICK &s;aid he had the highe&s;t opinion of before it came out, pre|facing his declaration, as he always did upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, with a confe&s;&s;ion that he had no eventual judgment, which was his way of be&s;peaking an in|demnity whenever his opinion &s;hould turn out to be wrong. It was the &s;tory of Aurora in LE SAGE's novel which is difficult to be dramatized to effect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One cau&s;e of the failure of this piece was the expo&s;ition of a Spani&s;h gentleman drunk on the &s;tage, which was certainly a gro&s;s violation of national manners, it being well known that nothing can be con&s;idered as a greater di&s;grace, a law having formerly exi&s;ted that if a gentleman &s;hould be convicted of even a capital offence, he &s;hould be pardoned on pleading his having been intoxicated at the time he committed it; It being &s;uppo&s;ed that any one, with the &s;en|timents of a gentleman, would rather &s;uffer death than confe&s;s him|&s;elf capable of &s;o bea&s;tly a vice as drunkenne&s;s. It were a pity but the cu&s;tom obtained in ENGLAND.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="183">The <HI>Game&s;ter</HI> is exactly the <HI>drame</HI> of the French &s;tage, except that it ends unhappily and thence be|comes a tragedy in pro&s;e. From this di&s;tinction the <HI>Game&s;ter,</HI> even though the audience were drown|ed in tears, obtained but a cold reception from the public; &s;o reprehen&s;ibly does cu&s;tom triumph over nature. Is it not extraordinary that the feelings dare not manife&s;t them&s;elves but by command, and that the affections of the mind are to halt till they re|ceive the &s;ignal to march in mea&s;ure and cadence? MOORE was aware of this prejudice, and there|fore began his play in blank ver&s;e, the &s;ubject, how|ever, was too touching, and the grief too natural to bear this heavy and unnatural garb. He threw it off and di&s;covered under it one of the mo&s;t perfect and beautiful ornaments of the theatre.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of its cool reception was a more
<PB N="180" REF="184">
natural one. The audience could not bear to be touched on the &s;ide of that darling vice which the play reprobated. The&s;e con&s;iderations and the fai|lure of <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> induced MOORE to per&s;uade a gentleman to father it. The ma&s;k was thrown off after the fourth night; when, to &s;hew what critics are, it was loudly condemned by many who had been its warm admirers while MOORE's name was concealed.</P>
<P>SHERIDAN, an excellent actor, a man of &s;trict honour, and a perfect gentleman, who, during part of a life of great credit and public utility, ma|naged one of the theatres in Dublin, for the better purpo&s;e of conducting that kind of undertaking, wrote one dramatic piece, and altered three plays the productions of other authors. <HI>Captain O'Blunder</HI> was a mere juvenile <HI>jeu d'e&s;prit,</HI> but it neverthele&s;s became a great favourite on the Iri&s;h &s;tage, and it was received as a model for all the Sir Callaghans, and other characters of that de&s;cription, which have added &s;o much plea&s;antry to the &s;tage. The <HI>Loyal Subject,</HI> and <HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> were only altered in that &s;light degree which a revival of plays &s;ometimes makes nece&s;&s;ary, and <HI>Coriolanus,</HI> the la&s;t piece this gentleman was concerned in was a mixture of SHAKESPEAR and THOMPSON, and brought for|ward

<P>MENDEZ, who though a rich Jew was no churl, for he was a <HI>bon vivant</HI> and a wit, wrote a farce called The <HI>Double Di&s;appointment,</HI> which was a plea&s;ant thing and a great favourite, The <HI>Chaplet,</HI> &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;et by BOYCE, that it, perhaps, contains &s;ome of the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t delightful &s;pecimens of &s;implicity in mu&s;ic that can be conceived, was greatly to the honour of Engli&s;h ta&s;te eminently &s;ucce&s;sful. The <HI>Shepherd's Lottery</HI> al&s;o &s;ucceeded, but not in the &s;ame degree. The&s;e pieces are by no means excellently written, but there is enough in them to &s;et &s;uch a compo&s;er as BOYCE properly to work, and he has made &s;uch u&s;e of the opportunity that the&s;e are &s;ome of the proofs that mu&s;ic to per|fection has been produced by Engli&s;h compo&s;ers, and ta&s;ted by Engli&s;h auditors.</P>
<P>SMOLLET, with who&s;e various publications the public are &s;o well acquainted, wrote more for his amu&s;ement than for fame. The <HI>Regicide.</HI> This play was refu&s;ed, the particulars of which circum|&s;tance SMOLLET has plea&s;antly but &s;everely treated in <HI>Roderick Random.</HI> He was remunerated by a &s;ub&s;cription.

<P>GLOVER the ingenious author of <HI>Leonidas,</HI> wrote a tragedy called <HI>Boadicea,</HI> which, however it may be full of the &s;cholar and the poet, has very little in it of the dramati&s;t.

<P>HILL, who was an excentric author of &s;o vo|luminous a kind that nothing came ami&s;s to him, who, though he begged to be excu&s;ed as to the quality of writing, beat out of &s;ight any author that had ever exi&s;ted in point of quantity, &s;eeming rather to have an ambition to be much than well read, pro|duced, among the wonderful number of things he engaged in, three dramatic pieces. <HI>Orpheus</HI> was in RICH's hands while his pantomime, or rather THEO|BALD's pantomime, was in preparation.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>THE dearth of great excellence in acting, from CIBBER's &s;ece&s;&s;ion to the time of GARRICK's ap|proach, gave me but little opportunity of going into that &s;ubject, and I now take it up merely to join the chain together, &s;o that the reader's view of the comparative merit of actors may be collected and undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Many of the actors and actre&s;&s;es ranked re|&s;pectively, but that was all. Among the&s;e were, as we have &s;een, KEEN, MILWARD, the elder, and younger, MILLS, JOHNSON, BOWMAN, THUR|MOND, WALKER, WRIGHT, BULLOCK, and Mrs. BULLOCK, and others, mo&s;t of whom were brought forward to ENGLAND from ASHBURY's nur&s;ery in IRELAND, which certainly promoted very materially the intere&s;t of the &s;tage. The public, however, were
<PB N="198" REF="202">
obliged to be content with the&s;e and a few more till the time of FLEETWOOD, when the later &s;hoots from ASHBURY's &s;tock began to emancipate and expand in Engli&s;h &s;oil.</P>
<P>From this time the Engli&s;h &s;tage began to know, among many others, MACKLIN, QUIN, RYAN, DELANE, HULET, and afterwards SHERIDAN, DIGGES, SPARKS, BARRY, MOSSOP, and WOOD|WARD, among the men, and Mrs. BELLAMY, Mrs. CLIVE, and Mrs. WOFFINGTON, among the wo|men; be&s;ides Mrs. CIBBER, and Mrs. PRITCHARD, and a large addition of names &s;omewhat re&s;pectable though le&s;s eminent than tho&s;e I have mentioned.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be evident that acting, having fallen off from the death of BOOTH and the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of CIB|BER, never regained its natural tone till the pub|lic &s;aw a perfect model for imitation in GARRICK. MACKLIN was &s;urely a turgid heavy actor, with neither real dignity in tragedy, nor native humour in comedy. There was a &s;ort of preci&s;e &s;tudied correctne&s;s which always reached &s;ufferance but &s;eldom admiration, like a reader at a pre&s;s, who goes critically over every word without feeling the &s;en&s;e of the &s;entiment, or the beauty of the writer. The acting, therefore, of that day mu&s;t have been cold
<PB N="199" REF="203">
and unnatural, for MACKLIN was the theatrical &s;choolma&s;ter.</P>
<P>QUIN, though he mu&s;t have been an actor of much greater under&s;tanding and more mind than MACKLIN, was &s;till in &s;tilts, and proved that though action comprehends the whole of oratory, oratory by no means comprehends the whole of acting. Greatne&s;s and dignity QUIN is univer&s;ally allowed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for a correct and commanding under&s;tanding, and a thorough and di&s;criminating power of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e of an author, I have always under&s;tood he never had a &s;uperior. We are told, and I do not di&s;pute the truth of the a&s;|&s;ertion, that his manner of utterance was &s;o ju&s;t and &s;uch a di&s;play of that feeling which the &s;entiment he pronounced conveyed to his mind, that he transfu&s;ed an equal &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure and conviction to his auditors.</P>
<P>This is &s;urely tran&s;cendent merit, yet it is only tran&s;cendent as far as it goes; for it is but one re|qui&s;ite of a great actor; who, when he lo&s;es &s;ight of the part he is performing, with all his rea&s;on, his under&s;tanding, and his judgment is no more than a performer lecturing his auditors. This actor's dig|nity was the dignity of QUIN, not of PYRRHUS, or
<PB N="200" REF="204">
CATO; in other words, dignity of per&s;on, not dig|nity of mind, and I think we may ea&s;ily conceive that BOOTH gave more force to the &s;entiment of CATO, by a&s;&s;uming the &s;uavity of the philo&s;opher, rather than the a&s;perity of the cynic.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ert with certainty any thing po|&s;itive on this &s;ubject; we can only a&s;&s;i&s;t our opinions by arguing rationally on &s;uch parts of it as we know to be infallible, and to form a conclu&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, an impartial view of the whole. Upon this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> with the perpetual objection in our teeth&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> however, that actors and their reputations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">e|ther, we can infallibly pronounce on the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters"> of ROSCIUS, BETTERTON, GARRICK, and others, who went for and accompli&s;hed a correct repre&s;entation of nature, but we have no guide to lead us to the degree of merit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by theatrical readers, and oratorical actors, any further than to conceive that they conveyed the correctne&s;s of their authors with|out manife&s;ting the beauty.</P>
<P>RYAN is &s;poken of in terms of the warme&s;t prai&s;e by his biographer; who fancying him&s;elf ob|liged to write neverthele&s;s in the language of can|dour, confe&s;&s;es, while he &s;peaks of his per&s;on and features, as the model of &s;ymetry and perfection,
<PB N="201" REF="205">
that having fir&s;t received a blow in the no&s;e in one affray which turned it out of its place, and a brace of pi&s;tol bullets in his mouth in another which broke his jaw, the&s;e accidents &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed his voice that he became a mo&s;t ridiculous object of imi|tation, but that he remained a very de&s;erving &s;tage favourite to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally acknowledged that he was a very &s;en&s;ible man, and a mo&s;t re&s;pectable member of &s;o|ciety, and upon this account he was probably encou|raged greatly beyond his profe&s;&s;ional merit. Nobody &s;eems to have known this better than QUIN; who in the mo&s;t friendly manner, after he had retired from the &s;tage performed Fal&s;taff regularly for his benefit once a year, till he him&s;elf took a hint from nature and found that the deception would not do. In &s;hort in &s;pight of whatever may be &s;aid by tho&s;e who, from the be&s;t intentions in the world, wi&s;h well to the reputation of RYAN he never could have ranked on the &s;tage as an actor of fir&s;t rate abilities.</P>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There &s;eems to have been a great deal of this philanthrophy about QUIN. I cannot deny my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of relating two anecdotes; which, though they are generally known, will not lo&s;e upon repetition. When QUIN found him&s;elf admoni&s;hed by age and infirmities not to appear again in public, he wrote to RYAN that he had the greate&s;t regard for him as a friend, but that he would not whi&s;tle Fal&s;taff for him or any man breathing, to which he added, that he had &s;et him down a thou&s;and pounds in his will, and if his occa&s;ions required it he was welcome to draw for the whole or any part of it during his life time. The other circum&s;tance relates to THOMPSON, to whom QUIN is &s;aid to have introduced him&s;elf at a Spunging hou&s;e, where he informed him, after a delicate and a pro|per introduction, that as he owed him two hundred pounds he thought he could not choo&s;e a more &s;ea&s;onable moment to pay his debts. THOMPSON remon&s;trated, but QUIN in&s;i&s;ted upon the fact; and having prevailed upon THOMPSON to receive the money, which, probably, in that &s;ituation was not a very difficult ta&s;k, he informed him that he had received plea&s;ure from a peru&s;al of The <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> equivalent to the &s;um he had now reimbur&s;ed, a compliment more to his philanthrophy than to his ta&s;te.</NOTE>
<P><PB N="202" REF="206">DELANE was con&s;idered as a &s;ound good actor of a re&s;pectable but by no means of a fir&s;t rate de|&s;cription. He was particular and GARRICK &s;uc|ce&s;sfully mimicked him in the <HI>Rehear&s;al.</HI> BOWMAN, however, we are told had merit enough to keep alive a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y in QUIN, though BOW|MAN at that time was very old. HULET was a u&s;e|ful performer and a good &s;inger. HARPER was a kind of a &s;econd to QUIN in comedy, and played Sir Epicure Mammon and other parts of that de|&s;cription with truth and &s;pirit. CASHEL is &s;aid to have been a promi&s;ing actor.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="207">We have thus &s;een that QUIN, MACKLIN, and RYAN, had a &s;mattering of CIBBER's &s;chool, the merits of which have been already canva&s;&s;ed, and which con&s;i&s;ted more, except in the in&s;tances of cha&s;te and natural repre&s;entation in BOOTH and Mrs. OLDFIELD, and their imitators, of the art of acting than the power of demon&s;trating nature. With GAR|RICK came perfection; perhaps that perfection which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have died with BETTERTON; and I think it may fairly be conceived that even QUIN, afterwards, improved by that novel, becau&s;e natural, &s;y&s;tem which at GARRICK's fir&s;t appearance he had reprobated.</P>
<P>I have not ranked SHERIDAN with the&s;e; be|cau&s;e, though a manneri&s;t and a peculiar actor, yet he had no nece&s;&s;ity to model him&s;elf upon the plan of any other performer, having as much genius and judgment as perhaps any one who ever trod the &s;tage. It was not at all times that you would get at GAR|RICK's real &s;entiments about acting, which indeed was no more than the pardonable duplicity of a trade&s;man who is obliged now and then to be a little in&s;incere to puff off his wares; but he had his unguarded moments, and through tho&s;e I am able to a&s;certain that he had made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to avail him&s;elf of the &s;ound &s;en&s;e and critical di&s;crimination
<PB N="204" REF="208">
which marked the judgment of SHERIDAN, and I can a&s;&s;ert with &s;afety, which is greatly to the honour of GARRICK, and a &s;trong proof of his under&s;tand|ing, that he &s;ought a connection with that &s;cholar and critic, in uniting him&s;elf with him in the ma|nagement of the Iri&s;h theatre, as much for the pur|po&s;e of learning to act as learning to manage.</P>
<P>A &s;onorous voice, and an expre&s;&s;ive face are very impo&s;ing requi&s;ites in favour of an actor; and where the&s;e are denied, the be&s;t under&s;tanding and the mo&s;t critical conception are veiled and ob&s;cured. There is &s;omething, however, by which they an|nounce them&s;elves. We acknowledge the value of the &s;un even in a mi&s;t; though we do not at that time perceive its brilliancy nor feel its influence, we are only aflicted that nature &s;hould oppo&s;e &s;uch an inconvenient ob&s;tacle to what we decidedly know would otherwi&s;e be capable of affording a mo&s;t complete and &s;atisfactory enjoyment; on the con|trary a meteor is a momentary object of delight; but our &s;en&s;es &s;oon correct the fallacy and our ad|miration vani&s;hes with the delu&s;ion that created it.</P>
<P>Nature had certainly thrown &s;uch impediments in the way of SHERIDAN, who, however, excited abundant admiration in tho&s;e who were judicious enough to penetrate beyond the veil and view the
<PB N="205" REF="209">
commanding power of mind and &s;trength of com|prehen&s;ion with which he was internally gifted. In the powers of an actor, QUIN &s;eems to have been &s;uperior to SHERIDAN, in the feelings of an actor, SHERIDAN appears to have been &s;uperior to QUIN. QUIN felt all he expre&s;&s;ed, and therefore exceeded SHERIDAN, could SHERIDAN have expre&s;&s;ed all he felt he would have &s;oared above QUIN.</P>
<P>MOSSOP from all I can collect was a command|ing but never an agreeable actor. There are va|rious ways of convincing the mind. We are con|vinced by &s;ubtilty, by plau&s;ibility, by blandi&s;hment, and by eloquence, but we can al&s;o be convinced by per&s;everence, by confidence, by earne&s;tne&s;s, and even by vehemence. The&s;e latter qualities &s;eem to have been MOSSOP's mode of convincing an au|dience into an admiration of him which with all his pomp, his &s;tiffne&s;s, his peculiarity and his affecta|tion he contrived to bring about. I have heard MOSSOP prai&s;ed for great and commanding powers in tragedy &s;uch as no other actor ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and it has been in&s;i&s;ted that, if he was quaint and &s;tarched at times, he was at other times grand and energetic, and, indeed, that his influence over the feelings of his auditor was irre&s;i&s;table. The mind, however, is not very fond of being threatened into plea&s;ure, nor are tho&s;e confe&s;&s;ions very &s;incere that are effected by
<PB N="206" REF="210">
compul&s;ion. We cannot, therefore, rea&s;onably ac|quie&s;e in the opinions of either the admirers or de|ciples of MOSSOP. Pro&s;elytes are &s;eldom gained by denunciations, nor do tho&s;e &s;cholars turn out brighte&s;t who have their educations hammered into them.</P>
<P>As the actors I have yet to name &s;tood high in reputation after GARRICK's return from ITALY, except HAVARD, BARRY, HIPPESLEY, COLLINS, and &s;ome others, who certainly de&s;erve to be &s;poken of with re&s;pect, but to whom it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be expected to pay &s;eparate and particular attention, I &s;hall mention tho&s;e actre&s;&s;es who, up to the year &s;ixty-three, ornamented the &s;tage with a degree of reputation certainly upon the whole, putting GAR|RICK out of the que&s;tion, &s;uperior to the men, and equal, but mo&s;t probably exceeding tho&s;e ladies of whom CIBBER &s;eems to have written the eulogium.</P>
<P>Mrs. CIBBER was a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite actre&s;s. In all characters of tenderne&s;s and pathos, in which the workings of the feeling mind call for the force of exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility, &s;he was like GARRICK, the character &s;he repre&s;ented. Love, rage, re&s;entment, pity, di&s;dain, and all tho&s;e gradations of the various pa&s;&s;ions &s;he greatly felt and vigourou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed. Her face, her figure, and her manner were irre&s;i&s;ta|bly impre&s;&s;ive, and her voice was penetrating to ad|miration.
<PB N="207" REF="211">
Actre&s;&s;es may have had more maje&s;ty, more fire, but I believe that all the tragic characters, truly femenine, greatly conceived, and highly writ|ten, had a &s;uperior repre&s;entative in Mrs. CIBBER than in any other actre&s;s. She was certainly not &s;o happy in comedy, but it would be no bad compli|ment to the pre&s;ent day if there were any actre&s;s who could perform it half &s;o well.</P>
<P>Mrs. PRITCHARD was an actre&s;s of more ge|neral abilities than Mrs. CIBBER. Mrs. CIBBER's acting was delightful, Mrs. PRITCHARD's command|ing. One in&s;inuated her&s;elf into the heart, the other took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Nothing could be &s;o fortunate for the &s;tage as this junction of different talents. It made acting, like a picture with grand breadths of light and &s;hade. We have &s;een the ex|cellence of Mrs. CIBBER; that of Mrs. PRITCH|ARD was uncea&s;ing variety. Lady Macbeth, the Queen in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> Clarinda, E&s;tifania, Doll Com|mon, in &s;hort, every &s;pecies of &s;trong nature received from her a poli&s;h and a perfection than which nothing could be more truly captivating. CIBBER's judicious remark that the life of beauty is too &s;hort to form a complete actre&s;s, proved &s;o true in relation to Mrs. PRITCHARD that &s;he was &s;een to fre&s;h admiration, till in advanced age &s;he retired with a fortune to the great &s;atisfaction of her numerous admirers.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="212">Mrs. WOFFINGTON was an actre&s;s of a mo&s;t extraordinary kind, and in &s;ome parts mu&s;t have been unrivalled. She had a bad voice, but this &s;eems to have been the only impediment to her becoming &s;uperlatively excellent; for though it is univer&s;ally allowed to have prevented her from in|tere&s;ting the pa&s;&s;ions in &s;o eminent a degree as ei|ther Mrs. CIBBER or Mrs. PRITCHARD, yet her &s;u|perior beauty and grace, the indu&s;try with which &s;he cultivated her profe&s;&s;ion by ob&s;erving the in&s;tructions of CIBBER, getting introduced to Mademoi&s;elle DUMESNIL, the attention &s;he paid to GARRICK, and every other eligible opportunity to improve, which &s;he &s;eized with &s;olicitude and avidity, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for her a &s;olid and firm reputation. She is &s;aid in Cleopatra, Jane Shore, and Cali&s;ta, and all other parts which require a form of commanding and maje&s;tic beauty, to have intere&s;ted her auditors to a degree of a&s;toni&s;hment. She al&s;o greatly ex|celled in many comic characters, but I cannot think it an addition to her fame, or to female delicacy, that the mo&s;t prominent of tho&s;e characters was Sir Harry Wildair. Re&s;ources are a bad &s;pecimen of great talents, and beauty like charity can hide defects.</P>
<P>Mrs. BELLAMY according to regularity comes next; but this &s;ort of ju&s;tice puts me out of my way, becau&s;e the art of &s;inking is not more advanta|geous
<PB N="209" REF="213">
to profe than to poetry. Mrs. BELLAMY, though an actre&s;s of con&s;iderable abilities, cannot be ranked with Mrs. CIBBER. In &s;hort in what I have &s;een, though it may, perhaps, be proper to rely with dif|fidence on my own opinion, yet I have a confirmed criterion in the recollection of tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions that authors and actors have made upon their auditors; for, though in particular in&s;tances, where both are taken up from partiality and prejudice, &s;uch judgment may have de&s;erved to have been arraigned, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible upon reflection to mi&s;take tho&s;e deci&s;ions which feeling has excited and conviction confirmed.</P>
<P>Upon this principle we can &s;ay of Mrs. BEL|LAMY that &s;he was natural, ea&s;y, cha&s;te and impre&s;|&s;ive; that, as far as per&s;on, features, voice, and con|ception went, none of which were by any means of an inferior de&s;cription, &s;he highly plea&s;ed and never offended; but the&s;e commendations, re&s;pectable as they rank her, would be cold and negative applied to Mrs. CIBBER, or Mrs. PRITCHARD, who com|manded attention, who &s;eized the pa&s;&s;ions and mo|delled them at their will, but with all this deduction the public would be at this moment be a good deal a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;uch an actre&s;s as Mrs. BELLAMY, were Mrs. SIDDONS out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>As I mean to bring into one view towards the
<PB N="210" REF="214">
end of this work that prodigious a&s;&s;emblage of ex|cellent acting, which was at its height &s;ome time af|ter GARRICK's return from ITALY, and has from that moment gradually declined, which opportunity will give me occa&s;ion to exhort the actors of the pre&s;ent day to look up to the few valuable ve&s;tiges which remain of that magnificent and ruined fabric, I &s;hall clo&s;e this book after I have &s;aid a few words of Mrs. CLIVE.</P>
<P>This performer, who fairly opened the book of nature, and pointed out every valuable pa&s;&s;age to &s;o good effect, that no actre&s;s in her way has completely &s;ucceeded who has not trod in her &s;teps, and traced her through all tho&s;e fanciful paths to which &s;he was conducted by the godde&s;s who delighted in her, had certainly mo&s;t &s;uperlative merit. We have &s;een no|thing &s;ucceed in her various &s;tyles of acting but what has been modelled after her. She created a &s;ort of &s;chool of her own, in which Mrs. GREEN, Mi&s;s POPE, and their imitators, &s;tudied nature and effect; but this will be hereafter better exemplified when we &s;ee her at a time when &s;he had perfected her &s;cholars; to which period I &s;hall defer this &s;ubject, to look after the opera, mu&s;ic in general, and other points relative to the theatre as well as to the conduct of both hou&s;es, during the theatrical interregnum.</P>

<P>AS this is the warme&s;t opportunity that can po&s;&s;ibly occur to take up the opera, and all collateral parti|culars relative to mu&s;ic, I &s;hall certainly avail my&s;elf of it, which will be the more nece&s;&s;ary as it is com|letely a novelty; no &s;uch thing having been done in any publication &s;imilar to this.</P>
<P>I know it has been the fa&s;hion to con&s;ider mu&s;ic as a menial and &s;ervile attendant of the theatre, ra|ther than an ally and an auxiliary. Nothing can be more u&s;ual than to read accounts of operas and
<PB N="212" REF="216">
ma&s;ques that have been performed with &s;ucce&s;s without even a &s;ingle hint as to who were the com|po&s;ers of the mu&s;ic, but I would beg leave to a&s;k if a piece were to be adverti&s;ed, written by a pen &s;u|perior, could it be, to that of SHAKESPEAR, and acted by the be&s;t members of the &s;chools of BET|TERTON and GARRICK, whether the audience would not hi&s;s down the curtain if they were deprived of the fir&s;t mu&s;ic?</P>
<P>I look upon this ungrateful contempt of mu&s;ic, in authors and managers, to have ari&s;en from their want of a ta&s;te for it, and their total inability to de|&s;cribe it. Mu&s;ic has never been encouraged but when BEARD had the management of Covent Gar|den theatre. What I mean to &s;ay is judiciou&s;ly en|couraged; for, LACEY as we &s;hall &s;ee, aped the fa&s;hion exactly as a guinea pig apes a &s;quirrel, or a clown a tumbler. When at any other time have we &s;een a manager like BEARD competent to afford the public amu&s;ement in this way? I have known GARRICK, and more than GARRICK, impo&s;ed upon by experiments till it was apparent they did not know one tune from another.</P>
<P>What hope or expectation then can the public en|tertain of receiving that rational, that irriproachable
<PB N="213" REF="217">
delight which the theatre is capable of affording us through the medium of mu&s;ic? If managers know not what it is, and if it is not to be known through the theatre, much le&s;s, heaven knows, is it to be known through the opera; a &s;pectacle where the dance is the plot and the opera the epi&s;ode<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An amateur, who deplored mo&s;t pathetically this innovation, by which operas are now &s;unk to nothing, was li&s;tening to an ad|mirable opera which was &s;o little attended to that the audience wi&s;hed it over with all its merit. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is too bad,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;uch exqui&s;ite mu&s;ic to be &s;o &s;lighted!"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear friend,"</Q> &s;aid a gentleman,

The only chance for &s;ucce&s;s at the opera hou&s;e now is to lengthen the dances and &s;horten the petticoats of the dancers."</Q></NOTE>; but remarks of this complexion will come better after I have gone through an account of mu&s;ic, which, during forty years, grew into the highe&s;t perfection in this country and is now &s;unk into in&s;ignificance, as land when it ceaces to be fertilized degenerates into fourne&s;s and &s;terility.</P>
<P>As ITALY, as well in the opinion of PURCELL as of every man who when he &s;peaks of mu&s;ic is competent to judge of it by its effects upon the heart, was the &s;chool alone in which Engli&s;h mu&s;ic could receive congenial improvement, and as GERMANY has ever thrown an impervious gloom over our plea|&s;ures, which has entangled our rea&s;on, and mi&s;led our &s;en&s;es into error and perplexity, which, in mu&s;ic
<PB N="214" REF="218">
in particular, has con&s;tantly introduced &s;chi&s;ms till we have been left nothing of harmony but its di&s;|cords, &s;o it will be particularly my bu&s;ine&s;s to watch the progre&s;s of this corn that once produced a fair and plentious harve&s;t, and the tares which have &s;ince completely choaked it up.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me here to go into the dif|ferences of HANDEL and BONONCINI, and the di&s;|putes of various kinds that kept up the opera as a &s;ubject of perpetual contention for a con&s;iderable time, and which, in proportion as HANDEL turned more to oratorios, and the Italian intere&s;t gained ground of the German, materially brought the opera gradually to perfection. The progre&s;s of mu&s;ic in ILALY had been a&s;toni&s;hing; and, though the great genius and judgment of CORELLI had in the public opinion conducted it to perfection, it was &s;oon af|terwards &s;een that mu&s;ic, though an imitative art, had properties immediately derived from nature which had been but little noticed, and, when no|ticed, were almo&s;t altogether rejected.</P>
<P>What I mean to allude to is the di&s;tinction be|tween melody and harmony, two things that though they a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in union are completely dif|ferent in their nature, whereas it is generally under|&s;tood
<PB N="215" REF="219">
at this moment that they both mean the &s;ame thing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I hope I &s;hall be pardoned for going into this becau&s;e, although there is no axiom &s;o clear, no po&s;ition &s;o infallible, not one in a thou|&s;and appears to comprehend it; nay, our dictionaries mi&s;lead us, while the &s;trictures of the mo&s;t &s;cientific writers, though they ap|pear to feel the fact, leave the mo&s;t penetrating under&s;tanding in the dark. Look for melody in any dictionary you'll find the explanation to be <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mu&s;ic, harmony of &s;ound."</Q> Look for harmony you'll find <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Concord, corre&s;pondent &s;entiment,"</Q> and for mu&s;ic you'll find, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;cience of harmonical &s;ounds."</Q> Nothing can be &s;o inde|finite, while nothing can be &s;o clear and &s;imple as the real truth. Melody means a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds, harmony a combination of &s;ounds, and mu&s;ic the art of uniting melody and harmony, or rather of a&s;&s;i&s;ting melody by the addition of harmony. Thus mu&s;ic of all &s;tudies ought to be the lea&s;t complex, and it is on this account that elaborate treati&s;es have done more injury to the cau&s;e of mu&s;ic than to any other &s;tudy, becau&s;e, in other &s;tudies, cau&s;es are frequently re|mote and hidden, and therefore demand enquiry and inve&s;tigation; but in mu&s;ic, where every thing is &s;elf evident and apparent, the fact &s;peaks for it&s;elf without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an advocate or a rea&s;oner, and &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed, a plain, a beautiful, and an un&s;ophi&s;ticated truth. This is clearly made out by the manner in which great men have gone into the &s;ubject in the treati&s;es that are extant; out of which prodigious number, I &s;hall in&s;tance, which will be &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e, RAMEAU the mo&s;t profound perhaps of them all, ROUSSEAU the mo&s;t ingenious, and D'ALEMBERT the mo&s;t &s;imple and faithful to truth. RAMEAU, with an eye more to &s;cientific reputation than a regard to general and legitimate fame, &s;hews the wonderful variety of which founds are capable, in terms of calculation, &s;o clo&s;e, &s;o con|nected, and &s;o clear, that the &s;cholar is a&s;toni&s;hed to find the endle&s;s po&s;itions, elucidations, and conclu&s;ions, to be propo&s;ed, agreed upon, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a correct inve&s;tigation of &s;uch numerous varia|tions of harmony. ROUSSEAU, with more &s;ophi&s;try, turns and twi&s;ts the &s;ame propo&s;itions in all number of ways; and, making a polypus of mu&s;ic, &s;hews that it may be tortured into a hundred fragments and yet every fragment retain its pri&s;tine &s;hape. What is the con&s;equence? RAMEAU, finding his arguments incongruous, and crude, fondly fancies he &s;hall bind them together by an expedient; and, before the mind has time to di&s;entangle it&s;elf from the rhap&s;ody in which it has been &s;o long ingeniou&s;ly bewildered, but not a &s;ingle moment convinced, he gravely attempts to implore a belief that every difference of opinion ought to be reconciled in the admi&s;&s;ion that the fundamental ba&s;s is exactly NEWTON's center of gravity. ROUSSEAU is not &s;o fortunate; he mo&s;t indefatigably ran&s;acks invention to prove a&s;&s;ertions, which he certainly makes out in argument: but at length, finding that though he has been able to e&s;tabli&s;h nothing for mu&s;ic he has e&s;tabli&s;hed a great deal for calculation, he is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of confe&s;&s;ing, that a fugue after all is <HI>Le mauvais chef d'aeuvre d'un bon mu&s;icien.</HI> As to D'ALEMBERT the ca&s;e is not the &s;ame. He volunteers him&s;elf on the &s;ubject; and, finding, &s;cientific as he was, and minutely acquainted with all the &s;ubtilties of argu|ment, that mu&s;ic as it had been repre&s;ented by all tho&s;e who wrote before him was completely unde&s;inable, for the &s;ake of the world, he &s;et about &s;tudying it. What was the con&s;equence? He found a pro|digious ma&s;s of chequered trappings and pye balled ornaments which &s;hrouded, eclip&s;ed, and &s;uffocated &s;omething like a form; with infinite labour and pains, he &s;tript off this mi&s;hapen and motley annoyance, and, having cleared away di&s;&s;onance, and di&s;cord, with tho&s;e enarmonic, and chromatic auxiliaries that had &s;weated and &s;mothered this poor unfortunate object, his ears became gradually attracted by &s;ome mo&s;t delicious &s;ounds, which, at length he found to proceed from almo&s;t exhau&s;ted melody, that like a dying &s;wan was &s;weetly &s;inging the dirge to its approaching funeral. This treati&s;e, which is profe&s;&s;edly written to elucidate, develope, and &s;implify that of RAMEAU, which D'ALEMBERT will not allow to be a &s;y&s;tem, has nothing for its object but the grand and &s;imple po&s;ition, that mu&s;ic con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, melody, and harmony; that melody is the gift of inventing &s;ounds in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which delight the ear, that harmony is the art of flattering the ear by the union of &s;everal &s;ounds to|gether; that melody, which has always exi&s;ted, is nature, that harmony, which is the only decoration of nature, and has been in|vented, is art, that, &s;o far as harmony is pur&s;ued for the embelli&s;h|ment of melody, it ought to be con&s;idered as a friend and a pre&s;erver, but that the moment this duty is neglected it beomes a foe and a de&s;troyer.</NOTE>. Compo&s;ers, about 1720, began to feel that
<PB N="216" REF="220">
melody was an animating principle which though it
<PB N="217" REF="221">
could exi&s;t of it&s;elf, harmony, the carca&s;e which it was intended by nature to vivify, could not. In other words, that melody was the &s;ong, and harmony the accompanyment; and, in proportion as the judg|ments of mu&s;icians began to be more &s;implified and the grand and natural effect manife&s;ted by the an|cients in the other arts con&s;idered as &s;ubjects of imi|tation, which circum&s;tance was adventitiou&s;ly for|warded by the &s;udden appearance of many com|po&s;ers in&s;tructed by nature and their feelings, the true end and tendency of mu&s;ic were accompli&s;hed; laboured, ab&s;tru&s;e, calculated harmony was rejected, and nothing but what &s;erved to give appropriate em|belli&s;hment to melody was retained.</P>
<P>The moment this &s;y&s;tem was fully re&s;olved on,
<PB N="218" REF="222">
it is a&s;toni&s;hing how beautifully the bird mu&s;ic &s;ung, emancipated from its cage; but to keep to plain narrative, HANDEL, who&s;e great di&s;advantage ad|ded to his ignorance of the Engli&s;h language, which was a great impediment to his vocal mu&s;ic, was this harmonic mania, though he turned and twi&s;ted it about pretty well, came forward with improved ex|cellence after his trip to ITALY, where he compo&s;ed The <HI>Triumph of Time and Truth,</HI> in which he has imitated Italian ba&s;&s;es almo&s;t to &s;ervility. GEME|NIANI appeared the advocate of melody, TARTINI introduced an appropriate union of melody and har|mony, and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic dared not further in|trude than to the mode&s;t and becoming bounds pre|&s;cribed to it by nature.</P>
<P>PERGOLESI, that mu&s;ical wonder; who, though we know nothing more of his compo&s;itions than two comic interludes, <HI>La Serva Padrona,</HI> and <HI>It Mae&s;tro de Mu&s;ica,</HI> one <HI>Salva Regina,</HI> and his immortal <HI>Stabat Mater,</HI> reached perfection, and therefore was poi&s;oned at twenty-two. GALLUPPI, who compo&s;ed mo&s;t &s;weetly becau&s;e he de&s;pi&s;ed extraneous har|mony, deliciou&s;ly agitated every plea&s;ing &s;entation by his mu&s;ic. VINCI, PEREZ, JOMELLI, and a long &s;tring of celebrated Italians brought this ta&s;te to ENGLAND, and confirmed its reputation till, from about 1756, to 1766.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="223">About this time the German ta&s;te began again to prevail; and, though BACH and ABEL, but parti|cularly ABEL, &s;till adhered to the perfect &s;tyle in which harmony had no triumph over melody, yet the manner began by PICCINI of loading air with accompanyment, which was ingenious enough in him, but followed awkwardly and bungingly by others, &s;hook that reputation which truth and nature had e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, in &s;pight of the meritorious efforts of VENTO, and a few others, the ear began to be &s;tunned in&s;tead of delighted, and mu&s;ic, that had &s;o lately rou&s;ed the affections and &s;oothed the &s;oul, was con&s;idered as de&s;titute of merit unle&s;s it could de&s;cribe the confu&s;ion of a battle, or the vio|lence of a hurricane.</P>
<P>The opera having thus been con&s;idered as the criterion and regulator as to mu&s;ic in this country, not very properly indeed &s;ince mu&s;ic ought not to be &s;ubmitted to any criterion or regulator but the heart and its feelings, the prevalent ta&s;te of the opera be|came the prevalent ta&s;te of the nation, and thus operas, which had certainly been a national benefit, became more and more a national injury, till the theatres following this retrogade motion, not &s;tep by &s;tep, but halt by halt, &s;idled off gradually; and left
<PB N="220" REF="224">
the throne of mu&s;ic to be u&s;urped by the demon of di&s;cord.</P>
<P>As I have attributed this fal&s;e ta&s;te to the pre|valence of German mu&s;ic, it is but fitting that I hone&s;tly make out my po&s;ition. I have &s;hewn, in how many periods of the hi&s;tory of mu&s;ic in this country, this innovation was to be dreaded. We have, in con&s;equence of the re&s;earches of the ori|nal printers of mu&s;ic, in the &s;ixteenth century, proved that documents were found which plainly &s;hew that the &s;tyle of mu&s;ical &s;tudy would be nature in the Italians, and art in the Germans. We have &s;een ARON RAMIS and AGRICOLA lo&s;t in the labyrinth of harmony, to which, by their own con|fe&s;&s;ion, they knew not how to find a clue, and yet the&s;e men, AGRICOLA in particular, wrote le&s;&s;ons for young beginners. Were not, therefore, the in|extricable barbarities of the Germans then exactly what they are now?</P>
<P>What did ZARLINO and his followers? The co|temporaries of tho&s;e Germans, did they lo&s;e nature to perplex them&s;elves and the world with art? No. They traced mu&s;ic to its origin, and not only felt but demon&s;trated that mu&s;ic is not derived from con&s;truction and calculation, but from nature and
<PB N="221" REF="225">
&s;implicity. My premi&s;es then are clearly made out by that mo&s;t infallible of all proofs the evidence of long experience; and, as the &s;tage upon the &s;ame principal is now adopting every thing mon&s;trous and unnatural, it becomes a que&s;tion whether, in our in|&s;atiable thir&s;t after novelty, we may not one day or other take it into our heads to di&s;card art and adopt nature.</P>
<P>But not to lo&s;e &s;ight at pre&s;ent of mu&s;ic it will be fairly a&s;ked me whether there is no &s;uch thing as melody in the compo&s;itions of the Germans? It would be very hard indeed if in &s;uch an immen&s;e wilderne&s;s there &s;hould not be a few flowers; but luxuriance was never yet a &s;ymptom of &s;trength or maturity. And this is the very thing I complain of; for were the Germans barren of genius, their impo&s;itions would be detected; whereas, by &s;cat|tering here and there a few traits of fancy, a &s;tudy of their works is &s;omething like what the poets de|&s;cribe of the road to the temple of plea&s;ure, which is flowery and deceitful, and which beguiles our time with idle trifling, till the night of di&s;appoint|ment overtakes us, and we view the promi&s;ed goal through the medium of delu&s;ion, and pre&s;ently lo&s;e it in the &s;hades of ob&s;curity.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="226">Melodies however the&s;e Germans have, but, by introducing them by fits and &s;tarts, their mu&s;ic has no character, except indeed the &s;ort of character that a ma&s;que has compared to a face; which &s;erves to di&s;gui&s;e it by the &s;ub&s;titution of deformity. I will not allow a work of genius to be complete in all its parts unle&s;s, like a perfect poem, its drift be pre|mi&s;ed, followed up, and concluded: and upon this ground the &s;toute&s;t &s;tickler for the pre&s;ent fa&s;hiona|able mu&s;ic, has not a &s;ingle argument to &s;tand upon.</P>
<P>I cannot more clearly give an idea of the&s;e re|dundant compo&s;itions, and their oppo&s;ites, than by &s;uppo&s;ing two orators: One &s;hall be a man of na|tural eloquence, who &s;upports his arguments in &s;imple and per&s;picuous language, who borrows no ornament but from rea&s;on, nor courts a&s;&s;i&s;tance but from truth: The other &s;hall deal in metaphor, al|legory, and allu&s;ion. He &s;hall wrap up the plaine&s;t axiom in figure, logic, and &s;y&s;tem; in &s;oaring to &s;ublimity he &s;hall fall into quaintne&s;s, and in &s;triv|ing to tran&s;cend, he &s;hall &s;ink to nothing.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t be the different effect on their hear|ers? One &s;hall delight and convince, the other daz|zle
<PB N="223" REF="227">
and mi&s;lead. One &s;hall win from attention the willing tribute of prai&s;e, the other wre&s;t from a&s;to|ni&s;hment a mixture of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>Every thing the ear acknowledges as mu&s;ic is &s;ong. Poetry is originally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;ung. ITALY, therefore, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t mu|&s;ical &s;chool; vocal mu&s;ic having been ever in greater repute there than in any other part of the world, and, on that account, the Italians are le&s;s apt than other compo&s;ers to go into any thing extraneous, for vocal mu&s;ic is in its nature regular. This is not the ca&s;e with the Germans, who&s;e &s;tudy being al|mo&s;t wholly in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, they traver&s;e the wide field of modulation, and quarter it as regularly as a pointer in the &s;tuble: or rather, like a citizen on a Sunday, who walks out till he is tired, forgetting that he has to come home again.</P>
<P>This then I conceive to be the cau&s;e of that per|ver&s;ion of ta&s;te in this country which has unhappily obtained, and in particular as to mu&s;ic; our national characteri&s;tic being warm benevolence and broad liberality, which too frequently encourages, when it ought to di&s;criminate.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE THEATRE DURING THE INTERREGNUM, AND IMMEDIATELY ON GARRICK's RETURN.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the fini&s;hing &s;troke, which was no le&s;s than indifference and neglect, had been given to GAR|RICK's determination of travelling for two years, that the public, which was infalliable, might feel their lo&s;s; both BEARD and LACEY, felt bold at the circum&s;tance. BEARD, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that, having e&s;tabli&s;hed opera upon a firm and &s;olid ba&s;is he &s;hould exclu&s;ively po&s;&s;e&s;s the favour of the town, and LACEY, from a contempt he had ever en|tertained of GARRICK's judgment as a manager, and a firm belief that through his fancied &s;uperiority he &s;hould both eclip&s;e Covent Garden, and lower his partner in the opinion of the public.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e effects GARRICK had fore&s;een, and had very early anticipated the con&s;equence of them. He &s;aw the certain operation of all that could po&s;&s;i|bly be brought forward to &s;upply the place of his
<PB N="225" REF="229">
exertions; he &s;aw, &s;upported as it was by a national ta&s;te, that mu&s;ic would naturally make a con&s;iderable head again&s;t him; but he &s;aw that LACEY would court the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this auxiliary to the temporary di&s;advantage of the theatre, and that even BEARD would not be able to find a &s;ufficient &s;tock of ma|terials to compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of tragedy and comedy.</P>
<P>His penetration was equally keen in re&s;pect to writing and acting, which he knew mu&s;t in his ab|&s;ence come to what the &s;port&s;men call a complete &s;tand &s;till. As to the veteran writers, they &s;o uni|quivocally adopted this &s;entiment that they pati|ently waited his return; and, for the novices, their certain ruin mu&s;t have been the con&s;equence of venturing any thing material in his ab&s;ence. Both the&s;e effects were in a remarkable manner produced. COLMAN, who&s;e reputation had received complete confirmation by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of GARRICK in The <HI>Jealous Wife,</HI> had the good &s;en&s;e to venture at no production of a fir&s;t rate kind, till his coadjutor re|turned; and POWEL, whom nature had endowed with many of the be&s;t requi&s;ites of an actor, by hav|ing the reins thrown over his neck, &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the admirable le&s;&s;ons he had received from GAR|RICK, who had been his mo&s;t able preceptor, and
<PB N="226" REF="230">
was bewildered out of that little native judgment he he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by folly, vanity, and indi&s;criminate applau&s;e.</P>
<P>All this which GARRICK had fore&s;een literally happened. ARNE was the only compo&s;er of real eminence known to the theatre at that time, for BOYCE had retired to the church. MICHAEL ARNE's mu&s;ic was always pa&s;&s;able but never ex|cellent, RUSH had ju&s;t arrived from ITALY and knew the ta&s;te of that country, but wanted the judg|ment to adopt that ta&s;te to Engli&s;h ears, or rather to Engli&s;h hearts. BATES had blu&s;ter, and bu&s;tle, and could compo&s;e &s;ongs as fa&s;t as a black&s;mith can make hobnails all of the &s;ame &s;ize and quality; and, as to the re&s;t, they were &s;till inferior pretenders.</P>
<P>It is true that there were plenty of compilers, who furni&s;hed the theatres with lumping penny|worths; and this mode &s;ometimes, as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Love in a Village,</HI> and The <HI>Maid of the Mill,</HI> was adopted with &s;ucce&s;s but never unle&s;s &s;uperintended with judgment and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the original compo|&s;ition of &s;ome excellent mu&s;ician. <HI>Love in a Village</HI> though benefitted by very beautiful mu&s;ic by GA|LUPPI, GIARDINI, and others, received two-thirds of its value from ARNE, and The <HI>Maid of the Mill</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="231">
being, though better a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Italians, rather a grand than intere&s;ting &s;election.</P>
<P>All this, however, was neither &s;een nor felt by LACEY; who, being accu&s;tomed to hear God &s;ave the King, Roa&s;t Beef, and Rule Britannia, knew there were &s;uch tunes but could &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h one of them from another, fancied that three com|po&s;ers mu&s;t naturally conquer one, and therefore &s;et RUSH, BATES, and MICHAEL ARNE to work, and pre&s;ently, in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> came out The <HI>Royal Shepherd, Pharnaces,</HI> and <HI>Almena.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time GARRICK received very di&s;|mal accounts from VICTOR, the trea&s;urer, of the immen&s;e &s;ums &s;quandered away to decorate &s;erious operas on the one &s;ide of the account, and, on the other, a beggarly account of empty boxes of which, though it was the very effect he anticipated, he bit|terly complained while he privately hugged him|&s;elf for his own &s;agacity, well knowing that the tendency of this temporary lo&s;s would be future &s;ame, and permanent profit.</P>
<P>GARRICK now began to feel a con&s;equence he had never known till that moment; and, excellent as his worldly acting had always been, he was a&s;to|ni&s;hed
<PB N="228" REF="232">
at his own power of attracting &s;uch univer&s;al applau&s;e.

<P>Nor was this all. He found the &s;ucce&s;s of dra|matic writers as indifferent as his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes would po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ugge&s;ted; he found that, in proportion as POWEL got SHAKESPEAR in his head he lo&s;t him in his heart; he found that his partner, having begun to give up operas as a bad thing, had, by way of retrieving his declining for|tune, conceived an expectation of finding coals in Oxford&s;hire, from which circum&s;tance he knew he &s;hould get as much of the theatrical property into his own hands as he thought proper; he found, in &s;hort, that the mu&s;ical mania began to be on the decline; nay he found JOHNNY BEARD deaf, and Dr. ARNE

<P>It was well for GARRICK that the public di&s;pi&s;ed this contemptible production under an idea that it was written by an in&s;idious enemy, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t have operated heavily again&s;t him; but the tide was in his favour and nothing could &s;top it. The town knew no other topic. Pre&s;ents awaited him, and every trifling circum&s;tance relative to him in ever &s;o remote a degree was a &s;ubject of general conver&s;ation. In &s;hort, no object of the greate&s;t national importance could engro&s;s more attention; the Royal family graced his fir&s;t appearance, while he as contentedly &s;wallowed all this adulation as an alderman does the green fat of a turtle, &s;till keeping up tho&s;e outward &s;igns of diffidence and apparent &s;elf-denial, which he ever put on, by chu&s;ing <HI>Much ado about Nothing</HI> for his fir&s;t appearance, that it might &s;ignify how much the goodne&s;s of the public &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his de&s;ert.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. GARRICK, AS AN AUTHOR, RESUMED.</HEAD>
<P>AS an examination of the merits of authors and actors, will naturally bring out all that will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary now to relate concerning the &s;tage, and my limits are verging towards a clo&s;e, I &s;hall go on with authors and &s;uch collateral particulars as are involved in a de&s;cription of their works.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t dramatic undertaking GARRICK en|gaged in after his return was the production of a play, in conjunction with COLMAN, who had given &s;trong proof both of genius and judgment in The <HI>Jealous Wife</HI>; he had given al&s;o proof of deference, mode&s;ty, and good &s;en&s;e, in permitting GARRICK to teach him his trade, for it proved in the event that COLMAN was never &s;o good a dramatic writer as while he had GARRICK at his elbow.</P>
<P>GARRICK's &s;hare of this play The <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage,</HI> was Lord Ogleby, and the courtly fa|mily, COLMAN's, Sterling, and the city family, and
<PB N="234" REF="238">
it is a&s;toni&s;hing how the two men appear in their &s;e|parate ta&s;ks. COLMAN has cha&s;tely and accurately delineated character, GARRICK has added to &s;trong character, &s;trong &s;ituation; and, to add to this con|&s;ummate knowledge of &s;tage effect, how admirably well it was got up!</P>
<P>It is really honourable to letters, and to the nation, that the theatre could be capable of furni&s;h|ing &s;o rational a treat, &s;o greatly perfect and ex|cellent in all its parts; &s;o unaffectedly attractive, as this play; which, though GARRICK only &s;uperin|tended it, was acted to perfection. I don't make this remark as a &s;ingularity, for many pieces at that time de&s;erved this prai&s;e. I only mean to prove that, when we con&s;ider the incomparable acting of KING, which, like a &s;ingle jewel re&s;cued from the plunder of time, is now pre&s;erved to us with equal brilliancy, his mixture of gout, folly, plea&s;antry, philanthropy, debility, and dignity, put on with &s;uch fancy and worn with &s;uch elegance&mdash;</P>
<P>When we reflect on that a&s;toni&s;hing creature Mrs. CLIVE; who, if &s;he her&s;elf had written the part as the portait of a real character, and, not con|tent with this, had infu&s;ed her&s;elf into this real cha|racter, could not have been more in nature&mdash;When we go on and &s;peak of the cha&s;te propriety and
<PB N="235" REF="239">
&s;ound good &s;en&s;e of YATES, the pert, vulgar con|&s;equence &s;o naturally and characteri&s;tically a&s;&s;umed by Mi&s;s POPE, the accommodating &s;ervility of BADDELEY, than whom nobody ever performed that particular foreigner, a Swi&s;s, &s;o well, as GAR|RICK perfectly knew, the ea&s;y, familiar imperti|nence of PALMER, not the late PALMER, but his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>When we add to all this, that the play was &s;trengthened by HOLLAND in Melville, and POWEL, in Lovewell, that Mrs. ABINGTON performed one of the chambermaids, and that the inferior parts, even to the coun&s;ellors, witne&s;s the admirable per|formance of LOVE in Serjeant Flower, were &s;up|ported mo&s;t ably, I cannot re&s;i&s;t a belief that the &s;tage at any time whatever could not have been in a &s;tate of higher perfection as to acting; for the merits of every performer I have mentioned were of &s;uch &s;uperior excellence that the parts be what they might, could not degrade them, and the public accorded their applau&s;e to HOLLAND, and POWEL, as much for the good &s;en&s;e and conde&s;cen&s;ion in accepting parts below their u&s;ual &s;tandard, as for the intrin&s;ic merit they di&s;played under &s;uch di&s;ad|vantages, and it heightened their opinion of Mrs. ABINGTON, in whom they plainly &s;aw, under the
<PB N="236" REF="240">
ea&s;e of Betty the chambermaid, that merit which af|terwards perfected into the elegance, grace and fa&s;hion, of Lady Betty Modi&s;h.</P>
<P>The <HI>Country Girl,</HI> which was performed in 1766, was a judicious altercation of WYCHERLEY's <HI>Country Wife.</HI> As it is now frequently performed and the public have had many recent opportunities of judging of its merits, I &s;hall only &s;ay that every thing has not yet been done which might have been to the advantage of that &s;ubject. <HI>Neck or Nothing,</HI> almo&s;t a literal tran&s;lation of Le SAGE's <HI>Cri&s;pin Rival de Son Maitre</HI> deceived GARRICK when he read it in the French, as it would have done any per&s;on, for it there &s;eems to be the very &s;ort of farce to plea&s;e on the Engli&s;h &s;tage. The event however, did not ju&s;tify the experiment, though it was admirably performed.</P>
<P><HI>Cymon,</HI> a piece written to di&s;play tho&s;e &s;cenic effects which GARRICK had witne&s;&s;ed in France, and Italy, was in it&s;elf a weak production but it was neither without intere&s;t nor plea&s;antry. There was always a want of con&s;equence in tho&s;e fir&s;t pieces, which were the &s;ole production of GAR|RICK, his pen was not equal to more than a farce. The performance, however, was powerfully &s;u&s;|tained; and among other material advantages, MI|CHAEL
<PB N="237" REF="241">
ARNE, by copying the manner of his father, and thinking of BOYCE as he compo&s;ed, produced a number of &s;weet airs, particularly tho&s;e &s;o delici|ou&s;ly &s;ung by his wife.</P>
<P><HI>A Peep behind the Curtain,</HI> came out in 1767, with good &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GARRICK who always knew con&s;equences, felt that the old vehicle of dramatic &s;trictures and mock rehear&s;als, had been gene|rally received with a &s;ort of jealou&s;y and revolt. He therefore be|&s;poke the favour of the town in a mo&s;t artful manner. KING &s;poke the prologue, in which there was this line,
<Q><L>I THOMAS KING, of King-&s;treet, am the poet.</L></Q>
The fact is, this admirable performer was the Bayes of the piece; but this equivocal a&s;&s;ertion, which nine-tenths of the audience took literally, gave a warmth to the applau&s;e which was of infinite a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the fir&s;t nights reception. GARRICK had practi&s;ed &s;ome|thing like this with &s;ucce&s;s before. <HI>Cymon</HI> came out after the public had been deprived of KING's exertions for &s;ome weeks, in con&s;e|quence of his having broken his thigh. They were glad enough naturally to hail the return of their favourite, which GARRICK took the advantage of, by making KING, in the prologue, thus be|&s;peak the public favour, in favour of him&s;elf. I believe the la&s;t line was, for I quote from memory,
<Q><L>Scarce well of one, &s;pare me, a &s;econd, tumble.</L></Q></NOTE> It was a fair &s;atire, indeed rather an admonition, than a ca&s;tagation; it hit but it did not wound; be&s;ides which, there are &s;ome things in it irre&s;i&s;tably comic, particularly the cir|cum&s;tance of making the old man dance again&s;t his will. This piece was incomparably performed,
<PB N="238" REF="242">
and the mu&s;ic, which was compo&s;ed by BARTHE|LEMAN, and which had a mixed character of Italian, French, and Engli&s;h, produced a degree of novelty which gave it good effect.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jubilee,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the <HI>Jubilee</HI> was a memorable epoch in the reign of GAR|RICK, it would be unpardonable to &s;peak of it without noticing &s;ome of tho&s;e curious circum&s;tances that attended &s;o extraordinary a bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Nothing can be more evident than that SHAKESPEAR might have laid very quietly in Stratford church, nobody would have di&s;|turbed his a&s;hes, had not &s;uch a popular mea&s;ure been the probable means of in&s;uring a plentiful harve&s;t to <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> on the following &s;ea&s;on. And yet, it was <HI>managed</HI> with &s;o much caution, &s;o much warine&s;s, that, according to the repre&s;entation of the matter to every body who was concerned in it, there did not appear any &s;uch thing in agitatton. This cautiou&s;ne&s;s an&s;wered two purpo&s;es&mdash;it not only drew many to Stratford who would otherwi&s;e have &s;u&s;pended their curio&s;ity till they &s;hould have &s;een it in London, but it &s;erved as a fea&s;ible excu&s;e for reque&s;ting every body's trouble and attendance for nothing. In &s;hort, GARRICK, in relation to the <HI>Jubilee,</HI> manoeuvred every where, and with every body. He procured abu&s;e to be in|&s;erted in the papers, which he got all his friends to an&s;wer. He en|li&s;ted a prodigious number of volunteers, who&s;e exertions he pretty liberally exacted, at their expence; and at length performed the &s;ame entertainment ninety-five times, in one &s;ea&s;on, at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> which he &s;ent people an hundred miles <HI>not</HI> to &s;ee. Indeed it was impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be &s;een; for, had the pageant been attempted at Stratford, the &s;treets were &s;o uneven that the cars of Melpomeme, Thalia, and the Fairies, would have been overthrown into cha&s;ms in the pave|ment; be&s;ides the leather, tin&s;el, and &s;pangled trappings, would have cut a lamentable figure by day-light. It is true they heard GAR|RICK, an advantage worth ten times the money, repeat &s;o exqui&s;itely his ode, which poem FOOTE pronounced excellent when he heard it, and execrable when he read it, and they heard ARNE's exqui&s;ite mu&s;ic to that ode; and, to &s;ay the truth, the dinners, and all the circum&s;tances relative to them were plea&s;urable, if we indeed except the fire-works, the hor&s;e-race, and the ma&s;querade. The la&s;t in par|ticular, was inconvenient and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing beyond de&s;cription, for the booth being built on a &s;wamp clo&s;e to the river, and nobody having con&s;idered that &s;ometimes in the month of September it rains, the company had &s;carcely a&s;&s;embled, when the wet began to ooze through the crevices; in five minutes after they were paddling in the wet; five minutes after that it was over their &s;hoes, and pre&s;ently they were obliged to take to the benches, then to the orche&s;tra, and then to the windows&mdash;thus there was not a creature out of about four hundred people that e&s;caped being wet through.</NOTE> a &s;pectacle, in which were in|troduced
<PB N="239" REF="243">
characters in SHAKESPEAR's plays, was performed as every body knows, more than half the &s;ea&s;on of 1769, and 1770; a circum&s;tance certainly unprecedented in the annals of the theatre. <HI>King Arthur,</HI> was brought forward in 1771, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;cenery, and mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly improved, as to the mu&s;ic, by ARNE, who greatly to his honour, though according to GARRICK's plan, he was obliged to introduce &s;ome mu&s;ic of his own, &s;o far from mutilating PURCELL, re&s;cued tho&s;e beauties from oblivion, which time and ignorance had before ob&s;cured. ARNE idolized PURCELL, and it was his pride in this particular in&s;tance, to place him in that con&s;picuous &s;ituation the brilliancy of his repu|tation demanded. GARRICK's view in bringing
<PB N="240" REF="244">
out this piece was to perform the &s;ame duty by DRYDEN.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet,</HI> was, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, with great dif|fidence, altered by GARRICK, in compliance with the judgment of a ho&s;t of critics, who have &s;o often &s;ugge&s;ted a nece&s;&s;ity of getting rid of O&s;tric, the grave diggers, and as much as po&s;&s;ible of the lighter parts of the play. The critics, however, on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, began to con&s;ider him like Bottom the weaver, who wi&s;hes to play all the piece. After a very few nights it was withdrawn. The <HI>In&s;titution of the Garter,</HI> was brought out in honour of that ceremony at Wind&s;or. GARRICK u&s;ed WEST's materials, and added a Fool, and &s;ome other comic characters. It was performed twenty-&s;ix nights a run at lea&s;t, equal to its merits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h Widow,</HI> performed in 1772, grew po|pular through the exertions of Mrs. BARRY, to whom GARRICK mo&s;t pompou&s;ly dedicated it. It is extraordinary, that he, who better than any man, knew it to be bad policy, &s;hould be &s;o fond of de|precation. The <HI>Chances,</HI> in which GARRICK per|formed Don John &s;o incomparably, and in which performance he was &s;o ably a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mrs. ABING|TON, then in the zenith of her reputation, was pro|duced in 1773, and is only BEAUMONT and
<PB N="241" REF="245">
FLETCHER's play with appropriate alterations. <HI>Al|bumazor</HI> was performed the &s;ame year. It was an alteration of the old play, as I have before &s;tated. It had no &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Alfred</HI> came out the beginning of the following &s;ea&s;on; it had great &s;upport but little &s;ucce&s;s. The mu&s;ic was confided to the care of THEODORE SMITH, who had better have let ARNE alone, &s;ince he had not the ability to treat him as ARNE had treated PURCELL in <HI>Arthur.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Chri&s;tmas Tale</HI> appeared in 1774. The &s;ubject was <HI>la Fee Urgelle,</HI> of FAVART, which BEAUMONT and FLETCHER had treated, under the title of <HI>Wo|man Plea&s;ed,</HI> but which had a much more ancient date. This piece was full of magic, and intended, like <HI>Cymon,</HI> to give advantage to &s;cenery and deco|ration; a circum&s;tance which GARRICK had adopted with great caution after the <HI>Chine&s;e Fe&s;tival,</HI> till his return from Italy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though I would not place this &s;pectacle under the head of dramatic pieces, it will not be improper to &s;ay a word or two con|cerning it. The <HI>Chine&s;e Fe&s;tival</HI> was a grand ballet, indeed nothing more than has been always con&s;idered as admi&s;&s;ible at the opera, and indeed at the theatre, except in that one in&s;tance, produced by NO|VERRE, the VESTRIS of that day. It took eighteen months in its pre|paration, and was expected to eclip&s;e every thing that had been &s;een of its kind, but unluckily we had ju&s;t declared war again&s;t France, and popular prejudice prevailing, the &s;pectacle was damned without mercy; the theatre was mutilated, and an attempt made to pull GARRICK's hou&s;e down. Did this &s;pirit prevail rationally it might do &s;ervice, but why one &s;pectacle of this nature &s;hould be interdicted to the toleration of &s;o many others, is an in&s;tance of &s;upererogate criti|ci&s;m, a kind of intruding ju&s;tice, that can &s;pring from nothing but ab&s;urd and unfair prejudice. FOOTE ridicules this very well in the <HI>Minor,</HI> where he makes SHIFT &s;ay, &s;peaking of his &s;ituation as a candle-&s;nuffer, that he acquired intrepidity, <Q REND="inline">"but,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an unlucky crab apple applied to my right eye, by a patriot gingerbread baker from the Borough, who would not &s;uffer three dancers from Switzerland, becau&s;e he hated the French, forced me to a preci|pitate retreat"</Q>
I have often lamented that the beauties of real cla&s;&s;ical writers are &s;eldom ta&s;ted by the erudite. FOOTE, who often really meant more than met either the eye or the ear, had in this &s;peech an idea of Military Ga&s;conades. The ball that &s;truck the French General CREQUI, was &s;aid to have had a label with the words, <Q REND="inline">"A CREQUI."</Q> This, &s;ays the French author who relates the circum&s;tance, is like the arrow that deprived PHILIP of Macedon of his eye, which was addre&s;&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>A l'oeil gauche de Philip.</HI>"</Q> No|thing can be better burle&s;que than this.</NOTE> LOUTERBOURG was at that

time fir&s;t known in this country, who wanted com|pletely, with great propriety, to alter the &s;y&s;tem of &s;cenery which always had prevailed, and indeed it does in a great mea&s;ure yet prevail; but GARRICK, finding the new &s;y&s;tem very expen&s;ive, would not adopt the whole of it, and therefore, though &s;cenes were improved, the evil has not to this day been completely cured. This piece has been mo&s;t un|mercifully handled, and heaven knows it was poor enough, but where &s;pectacle only calls in a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the relative acts, if the piece be of that cha|racter that admits it, there certainly is not &s;o much

<P><HI>Bon Ton,</HI> which is <HI>High Life Below Stairs</HI> rever&s;|ed, is a farce of con&s;iderable merit. It was per|formed in 1775. <HI>May Day</HI> was a mere trifle, it had very little &s;ucce&s;s.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. FOOTE, AND MURPHY RESUMED.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now return to tho&s;e authors, an account of who&s;e works remains to be completed. We left off FOOTE at the MAYOR OF GARRATT. His next piece was The <HI>Patron,</HI> brought out in 1764. The &s;ubject is from MARMONTEL, which COLMAN had an idea of treating, but was fore&s;talled by FOOTE. This comedy had preten&s;ions to more favour than it received; perhaps its cool reception was owing to its want of that per&s;onality which he had taught the town to grow plea&s;ed with. It is true, the prin|cipal character was intended for a nobleman who&s;e follies were known to the literati, but the public at large were &s;trangers to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary,</HI> the next piece of this writer, per|formed in 1765, was of another complexion. Here was character and per&s;onality enough. This co|medy,
<PB N="245" REF="249">
though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, the be&s;t writers of that day held it in contempt, the town greatly approved. It is more a melange, and a patch work play, than almo&s;t any thing upon the Engli&s;h Stage. The <HI>Commi&s;&s;ary</HI> is <HI>Le Bourgeouis gentilhomme</HI> of MO|LIERE, from which author, many other parts, and particularly the orator, who in the original, which is better than in FOOTE, after he is locked out of the door, harangues from the window, is al&s;o taken.</P>
<P>This is not all. The whole of the plot which re|lates to Mrs. MECHLIN, is &s;till a &s;tronger plagiary, for it is rendered almo&s;t word for word from <HI>La Fem|me d'Intrigue,</HI> and bits and &s;craps from other pieces of D'ANCOURT. Nay, the old widow who wants a young hu&s;band is not omitted, nor even the mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, nor the circum&s;tance of &s;ending the child home in a ba&s;s viol.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What I particularly allude to is the character of Dr. CATOUT, which was levelled at ARNE, who had peculiarities, and what man who ever lived has been without them? but perhaps upon earth never breathed a being of more honourable principles. I &s;hould be the mo&s;t ungrateful wretch that ever exi&s;ted, even though it may, perhaps, be deemed intru&s;ion, if I did not force this truth upon the Reader. ARNE re&s;cued my mu&s;ical fame and character, and e&s;tabli&s;hed both when his fiat might have cru&s;hed me, and all this with &s;carcely a per&s;onal knowledge of me. I have known him the warm and liberal friend of others. He had no radical fault in the world; but his mind was weak, and he was perpetually impo&s;ed upon, and is this a rea&s;on why a man who has left behind him a mo&s;t &s;plendid profe&s;&s;ional reputation is to be publicly expo&s;ed at the moment he was getting his bread by the public? Mimickry is at be&s;t a poor act, but it becomes infamy when it attempts to wound the peace of individuals.</NOTE> It cannot be denied, how|ever, that there is much plea&s;antry in the piece, but &s;till that wanton per&s;onality that pervades it, de|votes it to execration in all hone&s;t minds.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="250">The <HI>Devil upon two Sticks,</HI> which was produced in 1768, contained a good deal of general, and a good deal of per&s;onal &s;atire. For the vehicle, its author had, as every body knows, to thank LE SAGE; and, for many parts of the piece he had obligations to MOLIERE. The controver&s;y between the Fellows and the Licentiates of Warwick-lane, was fair game, and Dr. LAST, which it is &s;aid was actually a living character, and which was &s;o wonderfully performed by WISTON, is that &s;ort of per&s;onality which may be tolerated, becau&s;e the object was ob&s;cure, and the drift was general admonition for the cure of folly. Other objects, however, had better have been left alone. Knavery will never be corrected by the expo&s;ition of one notorious knave, except by law; nor will intrigues of a court wear a new face by informing an audience, rather indecently by the bye, that a commoner has been di&s;graced by accept|ing a coronet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FOOTE has now and then felt this &s;everely, the taking one Lord for ano|ther in this piece had very nearly damned it.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="251">The <HI>Lame Lover</HI> was performed in 1770. It had a good deal of the &s;ort of merit which characterized this authors pieces, that is to &s;ay a&s;perity and good writing; but the &s;tring may be wound up till it cracks. Health, and property, are objects of great &s;olicitude in this and every other country, but this does not prove that there is no fair game for the Stage but Phy&s;icians and Lawyers. The <HI>Maid of Bath</HI> acted in 1771, ought to have been hi&s;&s;ed off the Stage, not as a dramatic production, for it is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t pieces by this writer, but becau&s;e it was an unwarrantable and &s;candalous attack on a family, who were the more likely to feel the injury, by being in a public &s;ituation. It is certainly be&s;t when it can be practicable to treat unprincipled malignity, like this, with contempt; but the world in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;hould be the arbitrator, and do ju&s;tice to individuals. That this &s;entiment was felt, the fir&s;t nights recep|tion of this piece evinced; indeed FOOTE's pieces were generally very nearly damned the fir&s;t night, though they grew afterwards into fame. The fact is, what is every body's bu&s;ine&s;s is nobody's bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and thus harmle&s;s and unoffending characters are held up to deri&s;ion, to fill the pockets of profli|gate &s;atiri&s;ts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nabob,</HI> performed in 1772, is a play &s;trongly
<PB N="248" REF="252">
written, and boldly drawn, and upon a &s;ubject, had it been generally treated, which might have come within the province of the &s;tage; but the Theatre is no court of enquiry, and it was extreme|ly indecent to judge a cau&s;e before an audience which was at that moment agitating in the Senate. It was unhand&s;ome and unju&s;t, to excite a general odium again&s;t a body, by the expo&s;ition of a &s;ingle character; but the&s;e were the means by which this &s;atiri&s;t is &s;aid to have caught the living manners, which a&s;&s;ertion is fal&s;e; he never caught the living manners at all, he only caught the peculiarities of a few living individuals.</P>
<P><HI>Piety in Pattens</HI> was produced in February 1773, to eke out a &s;pectacle, which FOOTE had long pro|mi&s;ed the town, under the title of The <HI>Primitive Puppet Show,</HI> and in which he pronounced an exor|dium, celebrated at that time as the achm&eacute; of elo|quence, genius, and erudition, but afterwards found to be a mixture of hi&s;torical narrative, abu&s;e again&s;t the other Theatres, and a promi&s;e of excellence at his own, that never was kept; for, to u&s;e the words of an Iri&s;hman upon the occa&s;ion, the entertainment was all exordium. Any other author would have had his Theatre pulled down for this impo&s;ition. The <HI>Bankrupt</HI> had for its drift the expo&s;ition of tho&s;e
<PB N="249" REF="253">
nefarious members of &s;ociety, who manufacture ar|tificial failures, and &s;y&s;tematically evade the bank|ruptcy laws. It al&s;o went into the arcana of doing new&s;papers, both which objects were clearly fair game It was &s;ucce&s;sful; and except in a few trifling particulars, de&s;ervedly &s;o.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cozeners,</HI> which play we find again a good deal from D'ANCOURT, and in which al&s;o we are perpe|tually put in mind of FACE, SUBTLE, and DOLL COMMON, in the Alchymi&s;t, was one of FOOTE's bolde&s;t pieces. If Lord Che&s;terfield and his graces had been laudably attacked, there could not have been found a fairer object of &s;atire, becau&s;e it was not a reprobation of the man, otherwi&s;e than as it concerned a foul and poi&s;onous &s;y&s;tem that he had di&s;&s;eminated; but merely to bring on a clown and put him perpetually in mind of the graces, was leav|ing the improper tendency of the publication where he found it. Mrs. SIMONY was an unwarrantable attack. Strike at the vice with all my heart, but let the individual receive his puni&s;hment from the hand of ju&s;tice. It is not for the Stage to &s;uper|cede the practice of the Courts; and, if the laws have determined the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ober, &s;olemn enquiry into the perpetration of crimes, and if after all the innocent have &s;ometimes &s;uffered
<PB N="250" REF="254">
for the guilty, &s;hall the characters of men lie at the mercy of a prowling &s;atiri&s;t, and their fame be de|&s;troyed by the da&s;h of a pen? No man can defend the mea&s;ure, for it is not only a libel on the man, but on the government by which he is pro|tected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Capuchin,</HI> performed in 1776, is an aggrava|tion of all this author's former temerity, for to &s;hamele&s;s impudence, it added de&s;picable coward|ice. To attack and expo&s;e to public ridicule, a woman! It was too contemptible. But FOOTE &s;eems to have &s;tudied his own &s;afety through the whole of his conduct; having cho&s;en characters either &s;o in|dependent, that he excited only their contempt, or &s;o in&s;ignificant as to be &s;heltered by kindred pu&s;ila|nimity, and this grew on him, for, in the <HI>Cozeners,</HI> be was protected by Dr. DODD's gown, and in the <HI>Capuchin,</HI> by the Duche&s;s of KINGSTON's pet|ticoat.</P>
<P>Thus have I, with &s;ome pain, becau&s;e the merit of FOOTE was equal to any undertaking had he pur|&s;ued the right road, examined the dramatic works of this author, which I have conceived it my duty to hold out as a beacon to warn others of tho&s;e rocks FOOTE &s;plit upon, in his attempts to emulate
<PB N="251" REF="255">
ARISTOPHANES, who&s;e moral character has been de|voted to execration and contempt, and introduce that vicious and licentious perver&s;ions of broad truth and univer&s;al morality on the Engli&s;h Stage, which even the wonderful genius of MENANDER was unable to recover, and by which the Grecian Stage degenerated more and more; till at length it was lo&s;t in the wreck of the Grecian Empire.</P>
<P>We now return to MURPHY, who produced at Covent-Garden, in 1764, on the &s;ame evening, a Comedy, called <HI>No One's Enemy But His Own,</HI> and a Farce, under the title of <HI>What We Mu&s;t All Come To</HI>; two mi&s;nomers. A man, who is an enemy to morality, and the exerci&s;e of it in all mankind, cannot be &s;aid to be no one's enemy but his own; nor are fighting and &s;quabbling for trifles what ne|ce&s;&s;arily we mu&s;t all come to in marriage during the honey-moon. The la&s;t piece was the be&s;t, and per|haps was damned for being in bad company. It has, however, given repeated plea&s;ure &s;ince, under the title of <HI>Three Weeks after Marriage.</HI> The <HI>Choice</HI> was a Farce hurried up for the benefit of Mrs. YATES.</P>
<P>The <HI>School for Guardians,</HI> a Comedy, performed at Covent-Garden in 1767, was taken from three of
<PB N="252" REF="256">
MOLIERE's plays. The materials were good in their kind, but they made up a &s;trange incongruous ma&s;s, when mixed together. The Play was performed but &s;ix nights.</P>
<P><HI>Zenobia</HI> was a tragedy which had great &s;ucce&s;s. The opportunity MURPHY had at that time of wri|ing for the BARRY's was of great con&s;equence to his reputation and their's. It cannot be denied that the fault of pompous language pervades this, as well as the re&s;t of this author's tragedies; but &s;trong ef|fect, by no means &s;trange or unnatural, was emi|nently their characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>MURPHY's next piece was the <HI>Grecian Daughter,</HI> on which a variety of opinions have been ventured. It has been an acted pantomime, virtue outraged, and a great deal more, but no ob&s;ervation has been able to controvert one plain fact, which is, that it has been long a favorite of the public; that the grand incident on which the plot hinges is &s;imple, and natural, and begets a mo&s;t extraordinary degree of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is the old &s;tory of the <HI>Roman Matron,</HI> and the author is candid enough to confe&s;s that he

<P><HI>Alzuma,</HI> 1773, had the fault of the <HI>School for Guardians.</HI> It was a mixture of three French tra|gedies, as that had been of three French comedies, con&s;equently the author endeavoured to reconcile tho&s;e jarring intere&s;ts without effect.

<P><HI>Know your own Mind,</HI> performed in 1777, is a comedy of con&s;iderable merit. It had a long run during the &s;ea&s;on in which it was produced, and has been repeated frequently with good effect.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. HAWKESWORTH, HUME, FRANKLIN, BICKERSTAFF, HIFFERNAN, ARNE, KENRICK, GENTLEMAN, REED, AND LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>AS tho&s;e authors, who wrote principally after 1763, and but little before that period, had better, for the &s;ake of a general review of their productions, come in this place, I &s;hall bring them now under a regular review.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e was HAWKESWORTH, celebrated for &s;everal works of great ingenuity. For the &s;tage he altered <HI>Amphytrion,</HI> from DRYDEN, at the de&s;ire of GARRICK, but introduced very little of his own; the principal part of what he &s;upplied being from MO|LIERE. It did very little.</P>
<P><HI>Oroonoko</HI> was altered from SOUTHERN, by HAWKES|WORTH, by leaving out the whole of the comic
<PB N="256" REF="260">
&s;cenes. A vacuum that required much more than he has &s;upplied, admirable as his writing is, though not equal to SOUTHERN's, to fill it. The intere&s;t was beautifully kept alive in the original by the re|lief, bad as it was, the author had given it. The Planters were in nature and material to the plot, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed they were gro&s;s. It was difficult to protract the principal &s;tory; and, however meritorious the attempt, &s;o both HAWKES|WORTH and the public felt it. <HI>Edgar and Emmeline</HI> was an elegant piece; but changing of &s;exes has always &s;omething in it prepo&s;terous and revolting, unle&s;s contrived for &s;ome comic purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When we talk of HUME, we always add, the au|thor of <HI>Douglas,</HI> a play that ever was, and ever will be ranked among tho&s;e of fir&s;t rate merit, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed it is the le&s;s intere&s;ting becau&s;e of its re&s;emblance in the cata&s;trophe to many other things. The language is, however, beauti|fully poetic. GRAY calls it the true language of the &s;tage; and adds, that though it has infinite faults, the &s;cene between Matilda and the old Pea&s;ant is &s;o ma&s;terly, that it &s;trikes him blind to all the de|fects in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Agis</HI> was finely acted and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;pectacle,
<PB N="257" REF="261">
otherwi&s;e it is probable it would not have been per|formed a &s;econd night. GRAY, who loved HUME as a writer, &s;ays of this play,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I cry to think that it be by the author of <HI>Douglas</HI>: why, it is all modern Greek. The &s;tory is an antique &s;tatue painted white and red, frized, and dre&s;&s;ed in a negligee made by a Yok&s;hire mantua maker."</Q>
The <HI>Siege of Aquileia,</HI> performed in 1759, had &s;uc|ce&s;s; and as to the writing, it certainly is, in many places, very fine: but for a &s;iege, it is a tame bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and, &s;o far from being a re&s;emblance to the memorable circum&s;tance it ought to de&s;cribe, it is actually the de&s;cription of the Siege of Berwick, in the reign of Henry the Third.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fatal Di&s;covery</HI> was performed in 1769. HUME had certainly by this time greatly fallen off as a writer. This tragedy was reluctantly permit|ted during nine nights; and &s;o was <HI>Alonzo,</HI> which play, through Mrs. BARRY's admirable acting, de|ceived the audience on the fir&s;t night into a high opi|nion of its merit. HUME &s;ays, in his preface, that &s;he received applau&s;e greater than ever &s;hook a theatre. <HI>Alfred,</HI> the la&s;t production of this author, lived only three nights. In &s;hort, <HI>Douglas</HI> is equal in value to all the re&s;t of HUME's works.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="262">FRANKLIN, a voluminous writer and tran&s;lator, but who, like many other men of literary con&s;e|quence, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lent his name to book|&s;ellers, than which nothing can be more reprehen|&s;ible, for it is actually literary &s;windling, is &s;aid to have tran&s;lated the works of SOPHOCLES and VOL|TAIRE, and to have either written, or tran&s;lated, the following plays.</P>
<P>The <HI>Earl of Warwick,</HI> performed in 1767, was little more than a direct tran&s;lation of <HI>Le Comte de Warwick</HI> of LA HARPE. Mrs. YATES performed Margeret of Anjou incomparably. <HI>Ore&s;tes,</HI> pro|duced in 1769, from VOLTAIRE, was performed for Mrs. YATES's benefit. <HI>Electra,</HI> from VOLTAIRE's play, which he &s;tole from <HI>Hamlet,</HI> after having abu&s;ed SHAKESPEAR, was performed in 1774, but it had very little &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Matilda</HI> was little more than a tran&s;lation of VOLTAIRE's <HI>Duc de Foix.</HI> The <HI>Contract,</HI> a comedy brought out at the Haymarket, and damned in the pre&s;ence of the KING, and the ROYAL FAMILY, the only time perhaps they ever partook of &s;uch an amu&s;ement, is &s;tolen from <HI>Le triple Mar|riage</HI> of DESTOUCHES.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a very curious circum&s;tance, that the &s;ame incident that damned the play in England had very nearly procured for it the &s;ame fate in France, and yet certainly it is truly comic, and very natural. The father, the &s;on, and the daughter, are married unknown to one another, and are therefore embarra&s;&s;ed at making known the &s;ecret; but, when they find that they are all in the &s;ame predicament, a general amne&s;ty is pa&s;&s;ed. Upon this the younge&s;t daughter, a little girl of twelve years old, tells her father that &s;he has her &s;ecret to impart too: <Q REND="inline">"Hey,"</Q> cries the father,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why zounds you are not married &s;ecretly are you?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline">"No,"</Q> &s;ays &s;he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Papa; but I beg you'll let me be married as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible."</Q>
FOOTE &s;aid that, when he lighted the KING to his chair, his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked who the piece was written by&punc; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is written,"</Q> replied the wit,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by one of your Maje&s;ty's chaplains; but it is dull enough to have been written by a bi&s;hop."</Q></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="263">BICKERSTAFF produced the following dramatic pieces. <HI>Thomas and Sally,</HI> the principal merit of which piece was ARNE's charming mu&s;ic. Some of the poetry is neat and lyric, for this author knew the art of writing for mu&s;ic; but, whatever there is technical in it is completely fal&s;e. I heard a &s;ailor &s;ay, when he heard the expre&s;&s;ion
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tack about and bear away,"</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"why that's go out of the door, and go up the chimney."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Love in a Village,</HI> 1762, which had a run almo&s;t equal to the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> is made up, as we have &s;een, of &s;everal things, even to the &s;tealing of CHARLES JOHNSON's &s;ongs, which were before &s;tolen; one of the&s;e, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My Dolly was the faire&s;t thing,"</Q> from RAN|DOLPH.
<PB N="260" REF="264">
The circum&s;tances are neverthele&s;s inte|re&s;ting and entertaining, and the poetry is well calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion, but nothing can be more puerile than the dialogue. The mu&s;ic is a beautiful &s;election, and tho&s;e &s;ongs compo&s;ed by ARNE are delightful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Maid of the Mill,</HI> 1765, is much better written than <HI>Love in a Village,</HI> the fir&s;t act is perhaps as perfect as any thing on the &s;tage. It however anticipates the denouement, and every thing after|wards declines. The fault of this author was that he was bigotted to Italian mu&s;ic, and French dia|logue, and therefore the mu&s;ic in this opera is fine, and the dialogue dull, <HI>Ralph</HI> and <HI>Fanny</HI> are the be&s;t characters in the piece, but they are only an improve|ment on <HI>Hodge</HI> and <HI>Madge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Daphne and Amintor,</HI> 1765, was ST. FOIX's <HI>L'Oracle</HI> inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ongs to bring forward the won|derful &s;inging of Mrs. ARNE. GALLUPPPI's mu&s;ic was delightful, and CHALONS, the compiler, com|po&s;ed a good overture and a plea&s;ing duett. The <HI>Plain Dealer</HI> was judiciou&s;ly enough altered from WYCHERLEY. It was greatly performed. <HI>Love in the City,</HI> 1767, which piece has been &s;ince cut down
<PB N="261" REF="265">
to the <HI>Romp,</HI> was hi&s;&s;ed through &s;ix nights and then withdrawn. SHUTER, who would not allow this author to be more than a good cook, &s;aid when he came off the &s;tage on the fifth night, it was all up with the piece; brandy would not &s;ave it.</P>
<P><HI>Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a</HI> had con&s;iderable merit; but, in this piece, there were too many cooks; and, when it came to be altered under the title of <HI>A School for Fathers,</HI> it did no better. This author mea&s;ured his &s;cenes as an engraver &s;quares a picture, and thus, though correct, by being always regular, they were always cold. The prepetually going off with a &s;ong and teaching the audience, in imitation of the opera, when to expect a bravura &s;ong, a comic &s;ong, a cavatina, a duett, a quar|tetto, and a finale, began to grow intolerable tire&s;ome; be&s;ides &s;entiment at this time was only for comedy, and, ju&s;t as that author had com|plained that the <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage</HI> has antici|pated <HI>Love in the City,</HI> though he him&s;elf had &s;tolen the hint, &s;o he now complained that <HI>Fal&s;e Delicacy</HI> had anticipated <HI>Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ab&s;ent Man,</HI> performed in 1768, was only BRUYERE's &s;tory, which was copied into the Spec|tator,
<PB N="262" REF="266">
put into dialogue. It was too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">imzy to do any thing material. The <HI>Padlock</HI> was performed at Drury Lane, in 1768, as every body knows, with very great &s;ucce&s;s. This author's pen never held out to the end. There is a great di&s;proportion between the fir&s;t act and the &s;econd. It was however well managed. The plot is from CERVANTES. Nothing could exceed the &s;weetne&s;s of Mrs. ARNE's &s;inging, and BANNISTER as a manly, cha&s;te, and natural &s;inger, gave a &s;pecimen of abilities that had perhaps never before been heard.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hyprocrite,</HI> which was altered from CIBBER's <HI>Nonjuror,</HI> with an additional character for WESTON, had &s;ucce&s;s. Mrs. ABINGTON's acting was a rich di&s;play of fa&s;hion and elegance, as well as feeling and nature. The <HI>Ephe&s;ian Matron,</HI> was performed at Ranelagh, where it was con&s;idered as vulgar to li&s;ten to mu&s;ic, and therefore the real effect of this piece was never known. <HI>Dr. La&s;t in his Chariot</HI> was a bad &s;equel to a good piece. It was taken from MOLIERE's <HI>Malade Imagenaire.</HI> FOOTE wrote a complete &s;cene, indeed the be&s;t in the piece. The <HI>Captive,</HI> which was taken from DRYDEN's <HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> had no &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="267"><HI>It's well it's no Wor&s;e,</HI> a comedy which has &s;ince been cut down to a farce under the title of <HI>The Pannel,</HI> was nearly damned on the fir&s;t night. It was taken from CALDRONE. The plot was ex|tremely intricate and betrayed a great want of knowledge in this author of tying and untying a dramatic knot. KING, and Mrs. ABINGTON, were incomparable in the Valet and the Maid. The <HI>Re|cruiting Serjeant</HI> was performed &s;ucce&s;sfully at Drury Lane, after being repeated without attention, for two &s;ea&s;ons at Ranelagh. <HI>He Would if he Could,</HI> was LA SERVA PADRONA's. It was performed but once.</P>
<P>HIFFERNAN, a character in the &s;tyle of SMART, and HOLT, who, on account of his want of prudence and principle, every body &s;hunned, wrote an after-piece called the <HI>Ladies Choice,</HI> which had no &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Wi&s;hes of a Free People,</HI> was a hand&s;ome com|pliment, though by the bye it is mo&s;t mi&s;erably written, to the Queen, on her arrival in this country. It is dedicated to her Maje&s;ty in French. It con|tained a charge on Managers for not bringing out meritorious productions, which charge the want of merit in the piece it&s;elf completely refuted.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="268">The <HI>New Hippocrites,</HI> which is intended to ridi|cule the ab&s;urd practice of pinning implicit faith on the judgment of empiricks, was performed only two nights. It was a mi&s;erable bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>Earl of Warwick</HI> was a tran&s;lation from LA HARPE, but not &s;o good as FRANKLIN's. The&s;e and a poor farce, called <HI>The Philo&s;ophic Whim,</HI> make up all the pieces of this curious character.</P>
<P>ARNE, to who&s;e incomparable mu&s;ical talents it will be my pride to pay every tribute of prai&s;e and admiration, ventured incautiou&s;ly, though in one in&s;tance not unwi&s;ely, to write for the &s;tage. I allude to <HI>Artaxerxes,</HI> there was no tran&s;lation of this piece except the literal one which was u&s;ed for Engli&s;h readers at the Opera hou&s;e, where it had been performed with the mu&s;ic of HASSE.</P>
<P>With this tran&s;lation for want of a better, and &s;o much knowledge of Italian as might &s;erve to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the adoption of METASTASIO's ideas, ARNE formed his opera. There is nothing &s;ublime in his language certainly, but the circum&s;tances, which are &s;trong, and the conduct, which is artful, were &s;o rendered as not to lo&s;e their original force; If the poetry of the &s;ongs is not beautiful, it is at
<PB N="265" REF="269">
lea&s;t flowing; and, as care has been taken to pre|&s;erve the images which give the be&s;t expre&s;&s;ion to the mu&s;ic, of which this wonderful compo&s;er was &s;urely competent to judge, he would have found it diffi|cult to furni&s;h him&s;elf with a tran&s;lation to better purpo&s;e. HOOLE's is the be&s;t tran&s;lation we have, but it has a mo&s;t forbidding mu&s;ical a&s;pect. Nor is this declaration at all in favour of ADDISON's a&s;&s;ertion that non&s;en&s;e is be&s;t &s;uited to mu&s;ic, for there are many pa&s;&s;ages in this opera that in idea are grand and beautiful, and lend a powerful help to mu&s;ical expre&s;&s;ion. I &s;hall only out of many of the&s;e give only one in&s;tance.<Q><L>Behold, on Lethe's di&s;mal &s;trand,</L>
<L>Thy father's murdered &s;pirit &s;tand;</L>
<L>In his face what grief profound:</L>
<L>See, he rowls his haggard eyes,</L>
<L>And hark! revenge, revenge, he cries,</L>
<L>And points to his &s;till bleeding wound.</L></Q></P>
<P>When it is recollected how the&s;e lines are &s;et, and how BEARD &s;ung them, I think the appropriate epithet in&s;tead of de&s;picable, which has un&s;paringly been applied, ought to be exqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>In relation to the next piece of ARNE, he cer|tainly
<PB N="266" REF="270">
cannot be &s;o well defended. Here he had no METASTASIO to lend him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet the po|&s;ition of ADDISON is &s;o fairly inverted; that, by having indifferent words to &s;et, he never compo&s;ed &s;uch indifferent mu&s;ic. It was damned on the &s;ixth night, which would have been its fate on the third, but for SHUTER; who, when the galleries were very riotous, &s;eized a moment of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion and uttered very comically in the language of Ju&s;tice Clack,

This play was afterwards altered and performed at LOVE's benefit to as little purpo&s;e as before. The <HI>Widowed Wife,</HI> in which GARRICK a&s;&s;i&s;ted the author, who un|kindly in return &s;aid he had &s;poiled his play, was per|formed to bad hou&s;es for nine nights. The <HI>Duelli&s;t,</HI> taken from FIELDING's <HI>Amelia,</HI> was damned on the fir&s;t night. This author al&s;o brought out one plot of JOHNSON's <HI>Country La&s;&s;es,</HI> as an opera which, with the help of &s;ome Vauxhall mu&s;ic, was performed for a time, and the other plot as a farce which was damned on the &s;econd night. As to the re&s;t, KEN|RICK would write, but it was with difficulty he could procure him&s;elf to be read; for, what, be|tween his perpetually filling his head with rancour, and his &s;tomach with brandy, he burnt with envy at the &s;ucce&s;s of every rational man's pur&s;uit, and, by hating every body, was hated by every body.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. COLMAN, KELLY, LLOYD, Mrs. SHERIDAN, Mrs. GRIFFITHS, AND GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL next &s;peak of COLMAN, as an author of great value to the theatre; for, though it is clearly apparent that his dramatic pieces were not &s;o well con&s;tructed nor operated upon at any time of his life as when he benefited by the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of GARRICK; yet there is a peculiar neatne&s;s, a beauty, a correctne&s;s, without, however, tame|ne&s;s or vapidity, that has &s;carcely ever been equal|led. He was a kind of Engli&s;h, TERENCE, and engrafted cla&s;&s;ical eloquence upon truth and na|ture; indeed MENANDER's &s;alt which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have evaporated in its pa&s;&s;age from Greece to Rome.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Dramatic e&s;&s;ay of this author was <HI>Polly Honeycomb,</HI> written purpo&s;ely to bring forward
<PB N="271" REF="275">
Mi&s;s POPE. The end of warning young girls from that de&s;truction of which they are in danger, from &s;wallowing the mental poi&s;on which, to the &s;candal of the pre&s;s, is di&s;&s;eminated through the circula|ing libraries, is well accompli&s;hed, and there is &s;omething extremely dramatic and perfectly novel in the man's being gradually de&s;erted by his whole family, at the fini&s;h. This piece was fir&s;t performed in 1760.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jealous Wife</HI> was produced in 1761. This is one of the be&s;t comedies on the Stage; thanks, however, in great mea&s;ure to GARRICK; for ne|ver was there an occa&s;ion where his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was more wanted, or rendered more hone&s;tly or more effectually. COLMAN was a young author, which will ea&s;ily be credited, when the reader knows that the <HI>Mu&s;ical Lady</HI> made originally a part of the <HI>Jealous Wife.</HI> He had the good &s;en&s;e to li&s;ten to GARRICK, who took great pains with the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, and in the performing it evinc|ed great judgment and knowledge of effect. It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that this play was written by COLMAN and GARRICK in conjunction, in the &s;ame manner that they wrote the <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage,</HI> but this is not the fact, GARRICK &s;ugge&s;ted the al|terations, but COLMAN wrote the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="276">Let the public regret the acting of that day, when they are told that Oakly was performed by GAR|RICK, Major Oakley by YATES, Lord Trinket by O'BRIEN, Sir Harry Beagle by KING, Lady Free|love by Mrs. CLIVE, and Mrs. Oakley by Mrs. PRITCHARD, and that the other characters were proportionably &s;upported.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;ical Lady,</HI> 1762, has as good a tendency as <HI>Polly Honeycomb.</HI> Ladies make them&s;elves re|diculous in no way &s;o much as in pretending to un|der&s;tand the &s;cience of mu&s;ic, of which it is the &s;tudy and the intere&s;t of their in&s;tructors to keep them in the dark, frequently for fear of an inve&s;ti|gation of their own ignorance. The plot lies very round, and is mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly worked up. KING, YATES, and Mi&s;s POPE, very ably &s;upported the piece.</P>
<P><HI>Phila&s;ter</HI> was altered from BEAUMONT and FLETCHER by COLMAN, for the purpo&s;e of intro|ducing POWEL on his fir&s;t appearance. This alter|ation was made with great good &s;en&s;e, and with an eye &s;trictly to the reputation of the original au|thors. The a&s;&s;i&s;tance given to it by POWEL and Mrs. YATES, was of infinite benefit to the piece. <HI>The Deuce is in Him</HI> was brought out while GAR|RICK
<PB N="273" REF="277">
was in Italy, and had good &s;ucce&s;s. It was one of tho&s;e things in the &s;tyle of the French after pieces, and was full of that peculiar neatne&s;s with which this author always wrote. The plot is partly from <HI>Marmontel,</HI> and partly from a circum|cum&s;tance publicly known at that time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage</HI> has been already &s;poken of. The <HI>Engli&s;h Merchant,</HI> which is a clo&s;e tran&s;la|tion of VOLTAIRE's <HI>l'Eco&s;&s;ai&s;e,</HI> was performed at Drury-Lane in 1767. This play is full of &s;ound good &s;en&s;e; but it is too French, and too cold for any great admiration on the Engli&s;h &s;tage: in fact it is gold, and &s;terling, but is unfa&s;hioned. <HI>Lear</HI> was altered from SHAKESPEAR, and with &s;ome pro|priety; but we have already &s;een why TATE's alter|ation will ever have the preference. COLMAN be|ing at this time in the infancy of his Covent-Garden management, he was obliged to buckle to this kind of work, which was not his fort &s;o much as original writing. It was for COLMAN to invent, and for GARRICK to improve; and this is clearly evident here, COLMAN having lo&s;t him&s;elf very materially as to &s;tage effect from the moment he parted from GARRICK.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oxonian in Town,</HI> in which piece it was
<PB N="274" REF="278">
clearly evident that COLMAN was left alone, ap|peared at Covent-Garden. It very properly at|tacked a favourite vice; but the '<HI>Squire of Al&s;atia,</HI> and other &s;imilar things, had anticipated all the effect that could be expected from it. It would have quietly &s;unk to oblivion if &s;ome gamblers had not &s;tupidly volunteered them&s;eves as the guardians of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">&s;h honour, which fini&s;hed by their tacit confe&s;|&s;ion that they were the very outca&s;ts of &s;ociety that the author meant to detect and puni&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Man and Wife</HI> was a very injudicious performance. COLMAN ought to have known that nothing could &s;tand again&s;t the Spectacle that GARRICK was pre|paring at Drury-Lane. It mu&s;t, therefore, natu|rally lo&s;e him reputation. It had, however, the good effect of furni&s;hing GARRICK with the idea in his prologue of comparing the two hou&s;es to the two Magpies between Houn&s;low and Colnbrook. The <HI>Portrait,</HI> taken from <HI>Le Tableau Parlant</HI> of AN|SEAUME, was a burletta; the mu&s;ic by Dr. ARNOLD. It had very little &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Fairy Prince</HI> was a &s;pectacle gathered from SHAKESPEAR, DRYDEN, and GILBERT WEST, and brought out to introduce the ceremony of the In&s;tallation of the Knights of the Garter. In this piece Mi&s;s BROWN, afterwards the unfortunate Mrs. CARGYL, made her fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="279"><HI>Comus,</HI> performed in 1772, was of cour&s;e altered from MILTON. COLMAN would have more obliged the public, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted his own reputation, by un|dertaking &s;ome original piece. <HI>Achilles in Petticoats</HI> was an alteration from GAY. It met with very little &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> is another &s;trong proof that COLMAN felt him&s;elf awkward when left alone. It had but very moderate &s;ucce&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding he produced it at his own theatre with all the advantages that a manager has in his power to give his own productions. <HI>Epicene,</HI> altered of cour&s;e from JONSON, is judicious enough, but it had not great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;lington Spa</HI> was brought out at Drury-Lane, after COLMAN had &s;old his &s;hare of the other thea|tre. It was well written, but it wanted the touch of GARRICK's promethean pencil, which he was not much inclined perhaps to lend after COLMAN's apo&s;tacy; for though it is true that COLMAN made money by his Covent-Garden expedition, he certainly would have made more reputation had he &s;taid at Drury-Lane. <HI>New Brooms,</HI> an interlude, at the opening of Drury-Lane theatre, after GARRICK's &s;ece&s;&s;ion, was of cour&s;e well re|ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="280">The <HI>Spani&s;h Barber,</HI> performed in the Haymarket in the &s;ummer of 1777, at which time COLMAN be|came manager of that theatre, was performed with merited &s;ucce&s;s.

The <HI>Female Cheva|lier</HI> had no great &s;ucce&s;s; it was altered from the <HI>Artful Husband</HI> of TAVERNER. <HI>Bonduca,</HI> altered from BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, did no great mat|ters. The Company at the Haymarket were not competent to the repre&s;entation of &s;uch a piece.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Suicide</HI> I &s;hall fini&s;h an examination of this author's dramatic works. It was performed at the Haymarket in 1778, and was certainly COL|MAN's be&s;t piece, after the <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage,</HI> which evidently confirms how much the genius of COLMAN was indebted to the judgement of GAR|RICK. COLMAN, however, is an author very wor|thy to be imitated. Cha&s;te, neat, unexaggerated nature, he hit mo&s;t wonderfully. He was a kind of TENIERS in writing. His figures were &s;mall, but they were beautifully fini&s;hed. They had always the be&s;t effect however when they were grouped by GARRICK, who knew their keeping better than the painter did; and yet, though GARRICK knew light
<PB N="277" REF="281">
and &s;hade, &s;tyle and effect, better than COLMAN, without &s;uch admirable materals as COLMAN po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, the public would not have had &s;o much opportunity of benefiting by the judgement of GARRICK.</P>
<P>KELLY, who ought to follow COLMAN at an humble di&s;tance, wrote neverthele&s;s for the &s;tage with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. He happened, fortunately for him&s;elf, and unluckily for the public ta&s;te, to take advantage of the rage that then prevailed for &s;enti|ment. Every thing was at that time &s;entiment. It was the only &s;ecret of writing for &s;ucce&s;s. If a man was to be hanged, or m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ed, out came a &s;entiment. If a rogue triumphed, or was to&s;&s;ed in a blanket, what an opportunity for a &s;entiment! If the butler was drunk, or the chambermaid im|pertinent, li&s;ten to a &s;entiment! In &s;hort, if the alderman ate too much cu&s;tard, or his wife fre|quented too many routs; if the vice was gaming in the Alley, or at Brooks's, wenching, or drinking; if fortune came una&s;ked, or was deaf to &s;olicita|tion; if the &s;ubject was health or &s;ickne&s;s, happi|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery; hooraw for a &s;entiment!</P>
<P><HI>Fal&s;e Delicacy,</HI> 1768, had almo&s;t all the&s;e requi|&s;ites; and, that the audience might have enough of

Nay, &s;o far did this folly prevail, that the critics them&s;elves began to congratulate the world on the re&s;toration of MENANDER, cla&s;&s;ically conveyed in the manner of the Greek chorus.</P>
<P><HI>A Word to the Wi&s;e,</HI> 1770, was damned on the &s;tage, but the author was remunerated by a large &s;ub&s;cription. This failure has been imputed to KELLY's having broached his political opinions pretty freely in the new&s;papers; but without any outrage of probality or common &s;en&s;e, it would be more natural to impute its failure to the want of merit in the piece, which was mi&s;erably bad; be|&s;ides GOLDSMITH had, before this, balanced the account between nature and &s;entiment, in which poor &s;entiment was left minus by a con&s;iderable difference.</P>
<P><HI>Clementina,</HI> a tragedy, by this author, performed at Covent-Garden in 1771, was almo&s;t as dull as his &s;entimental comedy. It &s;et the audience a&s;leep, and therefore they had not &s;pirits enough to damn

This play, and the <HI>School for Wives,</HI> were fathered, out of kindne&s;s to KELLY, by a re&s;pectable gentleman now at the head of the police, which &s;hews that the public manife&s;t their &s;entiments, as to plays, without regard to the circum&s;tances or &s;ituations of the authors, but merely according to their merits; for this play had no &s;ucce&s;s, and the <HI>School for Wives</HI> not enough to flatter the pretentions of a reputable author.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romance of an Hour</HI> was taken from MAR|MONTEL, and was pa&s;&s;able enough; the <HI>Man of Rea&s;on</HI> is acknowledged, by KELLY's biographer, to have been inferior to the re&s;t of his works, for which there was no occa&s;ion; but yet the failure of it is very kindly attributed to WOODWARD's mi&s;conception of the principal character.

KELLY was but an indifferent writer; but, by hav|ing many companionable qualities, and being ready at all times to render his conduct plea&s;urable and &s;erviceable to &s;ociety, both the public and his friends, wherever they properly could, were happy in return to oblige and &s;erve him.</P>
<P>LLOYD, the friend and companion of CHURCHILL and WILKES, was a good writer. His <HI>Actor</HI> is a poem of con&s;iderable merit; and proved a bone that wits of high reputation have been happy to nibble at. His dramatic productions however are of no high rank. The <HI>Tears and Triumphs of Par|na&s;&s;us</HI> was merely an ode. <HI>Arcadia,</HI> or the <HI>Shep|herd's Wedding,</HI> was a compliment on the nuptials of their Maje&s;ties. It was neatly written. The <HI>School for Wives,</HI> from MOLIERE, was printed, but never acted. Indeed it was merely written to &s;hew how far MURPHY had borrowed from the French.</P>
<P>The <HI>Death of Adam</HI> was tran&s;lated from the Ger|man of KLOPSTOCK. It is complained of as a bad tran&s;lation; and certainly it is not a good play. The <HI>Capricious Lovers,</HI> to &s;ay the truth, is the only piece of LLOYD which can be called in the &s;malle&s;t

degree an acqui&s;ition to the &s;tage. It was per|formed at Drury-Lane while GARRICK was in Italy. The mu&s;ic was compo&s;ed by RUSH, and it was well acted. The &s;ubject was FAVART's <HI>Ninette &aacute; la Cour.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. SHERIDAN, who had preten&s;ions as a writer greatly beyond tho&s;e which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by ladies in general, wrote <HI>Sydney Biddulph</HI> for the clo&s;et, and for the &s;tage, the <HI>Di&s;covery,</HI> in which there is great nature and &s;pirit; and the <HI>Dupe,</HI> in which indelicacy, a quick&s;and &s;o often fatal to lady writers, &s;unk her venture. It has been urged that the audience were too delicate, but this was not the truth, for the <HI>Dupe</HI> was performed in 1763, and the rage for fal&s;e delicacy did not prevail till 1768.</P>
<P>Mrs. GRIFFITHS was a writer widely different from Mrs. SHERIDAN, for &s;he was a type of the celebrated Mrs. PHILIPS, the never to be enough admired Orinda, even to her Platonic Letters. Her dramatic pieces were the <HI>Platonic Wife,</HI> performed in 1765, and taken from MARMONTEL. It lingered through &s;ix nights. <HI>Amana</HI> was a kind of dramatic poem, but it was never acted. The <HI>Double Mi&s;take</HI>
<PB N="282" REF="286">
had about the &s;ame reception as the <HI>Platonic Wife.</HI> The <HI>School for Rakes,</HI> 1769, was a tran&s;lation from BEAUMARCHAIS, and proved to be the be&s;t of this lady's productions. It was well performed, and had a tolerable run. <HI>A Wife in the Right</HI> exhibited a lady writer in the wrong, for it was performed only one night. It came out at Covent-Garden in 1772. <HI>The Times</HI> gave Mrs. GRIFFITHS a hint that it was time &s;he &s;hould leave off writing for the &s;tage. This hint &s;he took, and this piece fini&s;hed her dra|matic career.</P>
<P>GOLDSMITH, who has done honour to Engli&s;h literature; who was the be&s;t meaning, &s;trange, good, whim&s;ical creature in the world; who&s;e in|tentions, though always right, by doing nothing like any body el&s;e he executed always wrong; who&s;e writings, which are a mixture of merit and &s;ingularity, &s;carcely had a part that did not contain &s;ome trait of him&s;elf; who has left two beautiful poems, a &s;weet ballad, and a charming novel, wrote &s;ucce&s;sfully for the &s;tage, but not up to the &s;tandard of his other productions.</P>
<P><HI>The good natured Man</HI> was brought out at Covent-Garden, exactly at the moment when the public
<PB N="283" REF="287">
began to be under the influence of the &s;entimental mania. There is nothing, however, better than Croker, and the incident of the incendiary letter; but Bailiffs were introduced on the &s;tage, which had been done an hundred times before, and has been an hundred times &s;ince, and it was enough that the audience did not like &s;uch vulgar acquaintance. There have been times when, if they had been real bailiffs, the managers would have &s;ympathized with the audience. To &s;ee however that the public are a very &s;hort time deluded when they adopt fal&s;e ta&s;te without con&s;ideration, they were glad of the next opportunity GOLDSMITH gave them of laughing away the gloom that had been thrown over their minds by the introduction of an in|fatuation &s;o totally contrary to the Engli&s;h cha|racter.</P>
<P><HI>She &s;toops to Conquer</HI> GOLDSMITH con&s;idered as a de&s;perate remedy for a de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;e. It ope|rated effectually; indeed like electricity. The au|diences &s;eemed as if they had been at &s;ome place the rever&s;e of the Cave of Trophonius, for they went in &s;ad and came out merry. This piece was a good deal abu&s;ed, and no wonder, for it went to the ruin of dull authors. Its efficacy, however, was con|firmed;
<PB N="284" REF="288">
and, whatever ab&s;urdities the public ta&s;te may have a&s;&s;umed at times, it has not &s;ince then trenched upon the pulpit. GOLDSMITH al&s;o altered for QUICK's benefit, the <HI>Grumbler,</HI> from SEDLEY.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. CUMBERLAND, BENTLEY, MASON, Mrs. BROOKE, Mrs. LENNOX, HULL, O'HARA, HOOLE, and VICTOR.</HEAD>
<P>CUMBERLAND, a well known voluminous writer; who, be&s;ides a prodigious number of dif|ferent productions, has laboured in the Theatrical vineyard with great earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;ome reputation, even from 1761, to the pre&s;ent moment, brought out, during the period to which my &s;trictures extend, thirteen dramatic pieces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bani&s;hment of Cicero,</HI> 1761, was offered to GARRICK, but not accepted. The bu&s;ine&s;s of Clodius and his &s;i&s;ter, and the debauching of Pompey's wife in the temple of Juno, were not to be tolerated. It was in fact, though &s;trongly written in many parts, evidently an inexperienced
<PB N="286" REF="290">
production, and therefore, the manager, in refu&s;ing it, did his duty by the public. The <HI>Summer's Tale</HI> was an opera, performed at Covent Garden Theatre in 1765. It was too heavy for a comic opera, and therefore was called a comedy with &s;ongs. The mu&s;ic was an Italian &s;election, but it was in general dull and ill cho&s;en. This piece was cut down to a farce, but it did as little in that form as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brothers</HI> was performed at Covent Garden, 1769, and received con&s;iderable applau&s;e. The <HI>We&s;t Indian,</HI> by infinite degrees the be&s;t production of this author, was performed at Drury Lane in 1771. Mr. CUMBERLAND had by this time &s;een, that recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to other authors if any expectations of &s;ucce&s;s were formed by him with &s;afety. He had tried this expedient with effect in the <HI>Brothers,</HI> which were <HI>Tom Jones</HI> and <HI>Blifil,</HI> and here he was determined not to inconvenience him|&s;elf; but I do not mean this a as reproach, &s;ince CAMPLEY's genero&s;ity, and other circum&s;tancs in the <HI>Funeral,</HI> the <HI>Twin Rivals,</HI> and other plays, &s;o whetted his theatrical knife, that it carved a mo&s;t entertaining play, which, in &s;pight of a great deal of affected language, created intere&s;t and afforded plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="291"><HI>Timon of Athens</HI> was an alteration from SHAKE|SPEAR, and performed at Drury Lane, in 1771, with but little &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Fa&s;hionable Lover</HI> came out the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, but it was a mo&s;t injudicious play and contained &s;uch a mixture of the <HI>Con&s;cious Lovers, Fal&s;e Delicacy, Ta&s;te,</HI> and <HI>Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to be more heterogeneous; and, to add to the other misfortunes of this comedy, MOODY was brought forward to per|form a Scotch&s;man. The <HI>Note of Hand,</HI> a farce, had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, but was not equal to the after-pieces of MURPHY or COLMAN, The <HI>Choleric Man</HI> was very much attacked by the critics, which brought out an ira&s;cibility from the author which has been ever &s;ince played upon. Let no man write unle&s;s he can know how to treat calumny with con|tempt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Battle of Ha&s;tings,</HI> performed at Drury Lane in 1778, turned out the battle of the critics, who had certainly too much rea&s;on on their &s;ide. They alledged that the truth of hi&s;tory had been violated, and that a perpetual imitation of SHAKESPEAR ex|hibited the writing of this author, as indeed it would of any other, to a di&s;advantage; not how|ever that it is not tolerated and prai&s;ed too by
<PB N="288" REF="292">
authors of the pre&s;ent day. The fact is, the public had been caught to expect too much from this play, which was certainly a &s;trange incongruous bu&s;ine&s;s. Any man might have &s;worn that the <HI>We&s;t Indian</HI> would have been the be all, and the end all with this gentleman. When a man fini&s;hes a work with &s;aying <Q REND="inline">"this is well but I &s;hall make the next better,"</Q> it is a thou&s;and to one but he &s;ucceeds; if he pronounces that nothing in its way can go beyond it, he &s;peaks truth as to him&s;elf, for he will not exceed it again.</P>
<P>BENTLEY, &s;on of the celebrated Dr. BENTLEY, wrote a piece, in the nature of the old Italian comedy, called the <HI>Wi&s;hes,</HI> which, as we have &s;een, was performed at Drury Lane, during that Summer that MURPHY and FOOTE had the manage|ment of it. It was odd, extravagant and eccentric, but there was &s;omething &s;o novel in making the whole pantomimic family &s;peak, when we had been accu&s;tomed to be entertained only with their atti|tudes and je&s;ticulation, that the public knew not how to take it. This helped its &s;ate which was however accelerated by its want of plan, connection, and intere&s;t. BENTLEY al&s;o wrote <HI>Philodamus,</HI> a kind of tragedy, on which GRAY has written a mo&s;t
<PB N="289" REF="293">
elaborate eulogium; but the be&s;t that can be &s;aid of it is, that it may be pa&s;&s;able in the clo&s;et, but it would be intolerable on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>MASON, a &s;weet and beautiful writer, and a man univer&s;ally beloved and e&s;teemed, wrote <HI>Elfrida,</HI> and <HI>Caractacus,</HI> neither of which pieces were in|tended for the &s;tage, they were brought out, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the mu&s;ic of ARNE, and though it is both natural and proper to prefer regular tragedy, as time and cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed it, yet it was a compli|ment to the &s;tage and a proof of COLMAN's cla&s;&s;ical di&s;crimination to bring forward <HI>Elfrida,</HI> though not &s;o well altered by him as it was afterwards by the author. In this kind of tragedy, <HI>Caractacus</HI> is the be&s;t becau&s;e the cata&s;trophe is more noble, more elevated, and the di&s;tre&s;s is heightened by a con&s;ideration that valour &s;uffers for Patrioti&s;m, and that hi&s;tory is not violated.</P>
<P>In <HI>Elfrida</HI> the puni&s;hment is hard, but it is the puni&s;hment of trea&s;on, and truth is outraged, by making ELFRIDA retire to a convent, rather fondly by the way than religiou&s;ly, while recollection bu|&s;ily reminds us, that the real ELFRIDA married the KING who murdered her hu&s;band. Again, a chorus of Druids, who were profe&s;&s;ionally bards, is &s;uperior
<PB N="290" REF="294">
both naturally and mu&s;ically to a chorus of virgins; but on the other hand, dome&s;tic woe always makes the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and the lyric part of <HI>Elfrida</HI> is better written for mu&s;ic than that of <HI>Charactacus.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am competent to give an an&s;wer to all tho&s;e who have expre&s;&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment that MASON never wrote a regular tragedy, by a&s;&s;uring the reader, that he him&s;elf told me, at A&s;ton in York&s;hire, that he had then in his bureau two tragedies, written agreeable to the u&s;age of the Engli&s;h theatre, but that they never &s;hould be produced, owing to the trouble and pain he had experienced from the &s;olly and caprice of managers.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mrs. BROOKE, who has written many novels that have been well received by the world, if that be a criterion of merit, wrote al&s;o a tragedy, the only production I am entitled to mention here, called <HI>Virginia.</HI> Mrs. LENNOX &s;tands upon much the &s;ame foundation as to reputation as Mrs. BROOKE. Her Dramatic pieces are <HI>Philander,</HI> never performed; the <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> performed one night only, in 1769, at Covent-Garden, and <HI>Old City Manners,</HI> altered from <HI>Ea&s;tward Hoe,</HI> and performed with very little ap|plau&s;e at Drury-Lane.</P>
<P>HULL, who&s;e various merits as author, actor, and manager, have long been known to the public, produced the following dramatic pieces. The
<PB N="291" REF="295">
<HI>Twins</HI> altered from the <HI>Comedy of Errors,</HI> and per|formed with &s;ucce&s;s; the <HI>Ab&s;ent Man,</HI> performed once; <HI>Pharnaces,</HI> an opera, &s;et by BATES, and per|formed at Drury-Lane, while GARRICK was in Italy. The <HI>Spani&s;h Lady</HI> performed for the author's bene|fit in 1765; <HI>All in the Right</HI> from DESTOUCHES, al&s;o performed for the author's benefit; the <HI>Perplexities,</HI> a comedy, that de&s;erved its title, for there never was &s;o perplexed a plot, which was taken from TUKE's <HI>Adventures of Five Hours,</HI> and in which BEARD &s;ung, &s;poke, and with his u&s;ual philanthropy did every thing el&s;e in his power to &s;erve his friend; and the <HI>Fairy Favour,</HI> a trifle performed in 1767, for the entertainment of his Royal Highne&s;s the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>HULL al&s;o wrote or rather fa&s;hioned into an opera, the <HI>Royal Merchant</HI> from BEAUMONT and FLETCHER. The mu&s;ic was by LINLEY. It had but little &s;ucce&s;s. Some of the &s;ongs were taken into the <HI>Camp,</HI> a piece performed at Drury-Lane in 1778, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written by the Ma|nager of that Theatre, at which time the public re|ceived them as we have &s;een with rapture, when they had pa&s;&s;ed them by with indifference at Covent-Gar|den, &s;o much fa&s;cination is there &s;ome times in a great name. <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> was a wonderful favorite for &s;ome
<PB N="292" REF="296">
time, wonderful, I &s;ay, becau&s;e perhaps nothing could have been more in&s;ufferably dull, but the &s;tory did the bu&s;ine&s;s. Queen ELENOR's poi&s;oned bowl and dagger penetrated to the very back of the upper gallery. <HI>Edward and Eleonora</HI> was altered from THOMPSON but it did nothing; <HI>Love will find out the Way,</HI> an opera, and the <HI>Victim</HI> a tragedy, fini&s;h Mr. HULL's works neither of which expe|rienced much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>O'HARA, through who&s;e pieces we have been taught to admire the native Iri&s;h melodies, pro|duced <HI>Midas,</HI> the <HI>Golden Pippin,</HI> and <HI>April Day,</HI> original burlettas; and tran&s;lated the <HI>Two Mi&s;ers,</HI> from FENOILLOT, and altered <HI>Tom Thumb</HI> from FIELDING. <HI>Midas,</HI> in which there was certainly much excellent humour, and fair burle&s;que, was by infinite degrees the be&s;t of the&s;e pieces.</P>
<P>HOOLE, who tran&s;lated METASTASIO, altered three of that admirable author's operas into tragedies, which producing a new effect by ending happily, received con&s;iderable applau&s;e. It was only an in|novation, however, for they completely exhibited an anticlimax, and lowered in proportion as the no|velty wore off. The&s;e tragedies are <HI>Cyrus, Timanthes,</HI> and <HI>Cleonice.</HI> It is worthy of remark that this new
<PB N="293" REF="297">
era of tragedy began with &s;entimental comedy, <HI>Cyrus</HI> being the companion of <HI>Fal&s;e Delicacy,</HI> and brought out in 1768.</P>
<P>VICTOR, more celebrated as a theatrical trea&s;urer than a theatrical writer, produced, however, &s;everal things of different de&s;criptions. He altered, mo&s;t mi&s;erably, SHAKESPEAR's <HI>Two Gentlemen of Verona; Altemira,</HI> a tragedy, was publi&s;hed but never per|formed. The <HI>Fatal Error,</HI> a &s;oft name for the com|mi&s;&s;ion of adultery, altered from HEYWOOD's <HI>Wo|man Killed with Kindne&s;s,</HI> was al&s;o never performed. The <HI>Fortunate Pea&s;ant,</HI> taken from MARIVAUX's <HI>Pay&s;an Parvenu,</HI> &s;hared the &s;ame fate and &s;o did the <HI>Sacrifices.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. SHERIDAN, JEPHSON, BATE, MISS MORE, BUR|GOYNE, KING, ANDREWS, MRS. COWLEY, AND HOLCROFT.</HEAD>
<P>AS I profe&s;s to clo&s;e this work at the death of GARRICK, to which period we are now ha&s;tening, and, as the authors of whom I have lately &s;poken produced theatrical exhibitions after that event, as well as tho&s;e who&s;e names are placed at the head of this chapter, I &s;hall merely have oppor|tunity to &s;peak of the nature and tendency of their different merits, and review &s;uch pieces as they pro|duced up to 1779.</P>
<P>SHERIDAN, a man of mo&s;t commanding talents, would have &s;tood inferior to very few writers, on this or any other &s;imilar li&s;t, had his time been en|tirely devoted to the theatre; for, in that ca&s;e, as genius loves to &s;pread and expand, and &s;eldom &s;a|tisfies
<PB N="295" REF="299">
it&s;elf with adopting when it can have oppor|tunity of traver&s;ing the wide range of invention, the public would no doubt have &s;een original tra|gedies and comedies, &s;uch as might have &s;erved as models for the imitation of authors not &s;o happily gifted, in&s;tead of &s;cenes, hints, and cir|cum&s;tances, mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly wrought together in|deed, but as far as any thing on the &s;tage from originality.</P>
<P>This is a fact &s;o univer&s;ally known, and &s;o con|&s;tantly admitted, that it has been often argued upon. It has been &s;aid that there is not in nature a new character, nor a new &s;entiment, and all that can be done is to take old matter and give it a novel ap|pearance. That it is &s;afer to do &s;o I will not deny; for certainly, when any thing comes in contact with the imagination that has been familiar to it, without con&s;ideration, we give credit for its merit upon the &s;pot, whatever we may do upon reflec|tion; and, having once prai&s;ed a thing, a fal&s;e pride prevents us from di&s;covering that we were de|ceived. It mu&s;t not be believed that CONGREVE's <HI>bon mots</HI> were all impromptus; and it is a literal fact that &s;ome of JOE MILLER's be&s;t je&s;ts are &s;tolen from the ancients; but when this is allowed, it will yet be granted, that Mr. SHERIDAN could have in|vented
<PB N="296" REF="300">
incidents as good as tho&s;e he has bor|rowed.</P>
<P>This is confirmed by this author's fir&s;t produc|tion, the <HI>Rivals</HI>; which, though Lydia Langui&s;h, Falkland and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ome other charac|ters, are copies in&s;tead of portraits, is the mo&s;t ori|ginal of his plays, and by many of the judicious thought the be&s;t. It was nearly damned on the fir&s;t night; and he is &s;aid to have remarked to a friend, as he withdrew it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have now got the la&s;t, and it &s;hall be my fault next time if I don't make the &s;hoe to fit."</Q> His labour, however, being only cobler's work, it required too much method for his volatile genius to buckle to. For the re&s;t, the adopted pa&s;&s;ages are not judicious; for Polly Ho|neycomb was better in its former place. The Nut|brown Maid is only fit for the poem &s;he adorns; for though her language on the &s;tage is full of &s;weetne&s;s and delicacy, it is no more appropriate than would be the fine &s;trokes of a miniature painter in the fini&s;hing of flats and wings. Being, there|fore, neither wholly original, nor wholly imitation, this piece &s;tands like this author's own &s;imile, in the <HI>Duenna,</HI> of the wall between church and &s;ynagogue, for it is part natural and part incongruous.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="301">We &s;hall &s;ee that Mr. SHERIDAN completely got rid of the original part of the &s;y&s;tem in his next piece. In the <HI>Duenna</HI> there is not a &s;ingle new &s;itu|ation from beginning to end. The whole of the plot of turning the Daughter out of doors is con|jointly the <HI>Sicilienne</HI> of MOLIERE and <HI>Il Filo&s;ofo di Campagna,</HI> where every circum&s;tance is to be found from the &s;erenade in the fir&s;t &s;cene to the marriage in the la&s;t.</P>
<P>In <HI>Il Filo&s;ofo di Campagna</HI> a father in&s;i&s;ts on his daughter's marrying to plea&s;e him, and refu&s;es her the man of her heart, which trouble &s;he gets rid of by palming her maid on the object of her aver&s;ion, to which maid in the end he is actually married; and it is impo&s;&s;ible but the equivoques in one piece mu&s;t be extremely &s;imilar to tho&s;e in the other. It mu&s;t be allowed there is more humour, or, if you will, farce in the <HI>Duenna,</HI> than in the other piece, but not &s;o much nature; for the countryman might be &s;uppo&s;ed without difficulty to mi&s;take a &s;mart country la&s;s for his friend's daughter, whereas it is a very &s;trong violence on probability to make I&s;aac mi&s;take the Duenna for Loui&s;a; one he is told is twenty years old, and the other he mu&s;t know to be &s;ixty.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="302">The bu&s;ine&s;s of Ferdinand and Clara is the <HI>Wonder.</HI> Clara elopes, Loui&s;a keeps the &s;ecret; I&s;abella elopes, Violante keeps the &s;ecret; Loui&s;a is the &s;i&s;ter of Ferdinand, &s;o is I&s;abella of Don Felix; Li&s;&s;ardo is threatened &s;word in hand by Don Felix, &s;o is I&s;aac by Ferdinand; Don Felix quarrels with his &s;i&s;ter's lover, &s;o does Ferdinand; Don Felix mi&s;takes I&s;abella veiled for Violante, &s;o does Ferdi|nand mi&s;take Loui&s;a for Clara; nay, &s;o clo&s;ely is the wonder copied, that Li&s;&s;ardo's anxiety to get Gibby a drubbing is apparent in I&s;aac's telling Ferdinand that he may cut Antonio's throat and welcome.</P>
<P>Father Paul is MARMONTEL's <HI>Philo&s;ophe &s;oi di&s;ant,</HI> who, as he &s;its at a fea&s;t and enveighs again&s;t gor|mandizing, actually &s;ays, as he entreats a lady to help him to &s;ome nicety at table,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Can't we be &s;atisfied with the whole&s;ome roots of the earth?"</Q>
and laments, after drinking a gla&s;s of Burgundy, that people will not be content, like our forefa|thers, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with the chry&s;tal &s;tream."</Q> But the cir|cum&s;tance that proves this author as fallible as any other is, that he has made the <HI>Critic</HI> laugh at the <HI>Duenna</HI>; for the clock &s;trikes four at the beginning of the <HI>Tragedy rehear&s;ed,</HI> which, according to the
<PB N="299" REF="303">
dedication, profe&s;&s;es to be critical, with a view of cour&s;e to ridicule the unity of time; and it &s;trikes three at the beginning of the <HI>Duenna,</HI> intending, without doubt, to mark that unity as a beauty.</P>
<P>The poetry, though &s;eldom original, is every where neat and &s;towing, and well &s;uits the beauti|ful mu&s;ic, partly &s;elected, and partly from LINLEY, which proved of infinite advantage to the piece. It was, however, very fortunate both for the author and the mu&s;ician that the rage for catches and glees prevailed a good deal at that time, otherwi&s;e the public might have thought it a little out of place to make the characters expre&s;s their happine&s;s by &s;ing|ing anthems. It has the effect of reviving fal&s;e de|licacy by &s;etting &s;entiment to mu&s;ic. It is im|po&s;&s;ible to omit in this place that the beautiful glee of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How merrily we live,"</Q> was rehear&s;ed, and thrown a&s;ide under an idea that it would have no effect.</P>
<P>As to the dialogue of this piece it is lively, pointed, and pertinent. It has not the ea&s;e of VANBURGH, the neatne&s;s of FARQUHAR, nor the wit of CONGREVE, and yet it has &s;omething of them all. It is managed with the cunning of a painter who does not imitate any particular arti&s;t, but who
<PB N="300" REF="304">
copies the &s;chool.

<P>The <HI>School for Scandal</HI> is no more original than the <HI>Duenna.</HI> The &s;chool it&s;elf is CONGREVE's <HI>Cabal,</HI> and the play may fairly be called A Sequel to the <HI>Way of the World.</HI> The &s;candal has been all detailed in different pieces, but principally in the <HI>Plain Dealer,</HI> where in Novel, Lord Plau&s;ible, Olivia, and Eliza will be found, Sir Benjamin, Crab, Lady Sneerwell and Mrs. Candour. The brothers have been in a variety of productions from the Adelphi to fifty other things; but the <HI>Squire of Al&s;atia,</HI> on the &s;tage, and <HI>Tom Jones,</HI> in the clo&s;et, contain the clo&s;e&s;t re&s;emblances.

<P>The dialogue of the <HI>School for Scandal</HI> is in general admirable, but it is expre&s;sly warped in places for the purpo&s;e of procuring that applau&s;e as ADDISON calls it which proceeds from the head rather than the heart.

<P>JEPHSON, a gentleman I believe greatly courted and beloved by his private friends, produced <HI>Bri|ganza,</HI> a piece written with con&s;iderable judgment and good poetic effect. The &s;cene of the Monk, though evidently an imitation of King John and Hubert, is uncommonly beautiful and highly wrought. The re&s;emblance of this play to <HI>Venice Pre&s;erved</HI> in the end injured its &s;ucce&s;s, though it was well received and frequently repeated during the fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on, which was in 1775.

<P>HARRIS, who&s;e Hermes, and &s;ome other works, are de&s;ervedly celebrated, wrote the <HI>Spring,</HI> a pa&s;|toral, which was performed at Drury-Lane.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>I GET now to a critical part of my ta&s;k. I am to &s;hew what the merits of tho&s;e actors were who com|pri&s;ed the &s;chool of GARRICK, to &s;ee by compa|ri&s;on whether they equalled or excelled the actors before, and at the time of BETTERTON, and to a&s;|certain by deduction how much the acting of the pre&s;ent day has gradually fallen off &s;ince it has been obliged to pick up its intelligence without any ac|knowledged preceptor.</P>
<P>With what ability I &s;hall execute this task let my readers judge. I confe&s;s I undertake it with a mixture of plea&s;ure and reluctance: plea&s;ure, be|cau&s;e I think it has been almo&s;t already proved that the acting of GARRICK's pupils was &s;uperior to that of BETTERTON's, and reluctance, becau&s;e I
<PB N="321" REF="325">
am afraid it is but too apparent that, when nature &s;hall have de&s;troyed the few remaining traces of that admirable and difficult art, the &s;ecret will be wholly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I know I have to guard my&s;elf again&s;t early pre|judice, and to u&s;e every caution, le&s;t I mi&s;take unqualified admiration for fixed judgment. Errors, imbibed in youth, are certainly difficult to irradi|cate; but the&s;e are generally &s;ingle and uncon|firmed. They have their &s;ource in the fancy, not in the heart; they are beautiful to the &s;ight, but &s;hrink at the touch; in the ab&s;ence of rea&s;on, they excite plea&s;ure, but reflection &s;hames us into an acknowledgement of the delu&s;ion. On the contrary, when the &s;en&s;es receive tho&s;e plea&s;ures which the mind approves, when reiterated delibe|ration confirms that delight which takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;u&s;ceptible &s;oul, nothing palls, nothing &s;atiates; repetition reveals new beauties, and the enjoyment which was born from admiration bears the te&s;t of time and accompanies the mind to maturity.</P>
<P>Le&s;t however I may be fallible, le&s;t this doctrine may be fallible, which I cannot ea&s;ily credit, I &s;hall &s;trengthen my own opinions by the opinions of
<PB N="322" REF="326">
infinitely better judges than my&s;elf, till it be con|fe&s;&s;ed, whatever I may want of ability, I want nothing of candour, or rectitude.</P>
<P>In point of reputation, as men and members of &s;ociety, actors in their general e&s;timation have de|clined, from SHAKESPEAR onwards to the pre&s;ent hour. See how this has happened. Our immortal bard, who was another AESCHYLUS, was, like AES|CHYLUS, an actor. JONSON was an actor. The be&s;t authors of that time were actors; and, therefore, in emulation of the Greeks, were the theatres placed under the management of actors. What was the con&s;equence? Actors accumulated fortunes, were cla&s;&s;ed and e&s;timated re&s;pectably; and, when the troubles of CHARLES the Fir&s;t clo&s;ed the theatre, its members were con&s;idered as loyal and honourable men, fit to be tru&s;ted with commi&s;&s;ions to fight in the king's cau&s;e, till through the intere&s;t of CROM|WELL and the puritans, they yielded to the general pre&s;&s;ure of the times.</P>
<P>From that moment the theatre got into extrane|ous hands, and thence may be dated the fir&s;t &s;tep toward the degradation of actors. The names of D'AVENANT, and KILLEGREW, gave cold expec|tation of any profe&s;&s;ional encouragement to actors
<PB N="323" REF="327">
in their own right. It is true that they were under the immediate protection of the Lord Chamberlain, and could not be otherwi&s;e than &s;afely guarded by their privilege of appeal to that Nobleman, but this &s;ubjected them to adver&s;e intere&s;ts, which were &s;ure to have adver&s;e con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s of this however we have &s;een. We have &s;een even in D'AVENANT's time that the two companies dwindled into the &s;ize of one, and then were glad enough to unite to keep acting upon its legs. We have &s;een the theatre, after it was &s;plit and divided into factions, under RICH, torne, and di&s;tracted, till at length the actors, with BETTER|TON at their head, removed, with the permi&s;&s;ion of King WILLIAM, to Lincoln's Inn Fields, where, inconvenienced as they were, they had &s;ucce&s;s and were re&s;pected. We have &s;een in what manner, from the various ill conduct of RICH, that he was interdicted by the Lord Chamberlain, with both the patents in his pocket which were granted to D'AVENANT and KILLEGREW. We have &s;een the various changes which fixed CIBBER in the ma|nagement, at which time acting began to grow into fame and reputation. We have &s;een, imme|diately after his &s;ece&s;&s;ion, how low it &s;unk under the management of per&s;ons who were not actors. We
<PB N="324" REF="328">
have &s;een the mi&s;eries of the &s;tage in the time of FLEETWOOD, and we have &s;een it re&s;cued from tho&s;e mi&s;eries by GARRICK. GARRICK is now lo&s;t to us, and what we &s;ee now, and may hereafter &s;ee, I rejoice it does not come within my province to notice.</P>
<P>The inference from the&s;e ob&s;ervations naturally is; that, as the theatre has invariably been a &s;ource of meritorious emolument to every de&s;cription of actors, as the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor has been con|&s;idered as perfectly reputable, as the fair privileges of that profe&s;&s;ion have been accorded and enjoyed as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ight which could not be trenched upon, when the property has been confided to actors; and, as the theatre has been, without a &s;ingle deviation, plunged into difficulties, as the talents by means of which alone a theatre can exi&s;t, for authors are nothing without actors, have been mi&s;under&s;tood, mi&s;applied, &s;lighted and &s;et at nought; as &s;alaries have been curtailed, mulcts impo&s;ed, ta&s;k-ma&s;ters employed, and other unju&s;t and unfair means re&s;orted to, to di&s;tre&s;s actors, when the property has fallen into the hands of mere adventurers or men of fortune; &s;o it is evidently proved by circum&s;tances that cannot be controverted, and conclu&s;ions that cannot be mi&s;taken, that the theatre can never
<PB N="325" REF="329">
flouri&s;h to any degree of perfection unle&s;s confided to the management of actors, and regulated by that paramount authority, which I have contended throughout this work has ever been, and ever ought to be, ve&s;ted in the Lord Chamberlain.</P>
<P>Other circum&s;tances corroborate this beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of contradiction. Per&s;ons of talents, education, family, have become actors without degradation. Can this be &s;o when they are to be con&s;idered as per&s;ons merely employed, mercena|ries, hirelings? Men with the&s;e recommendations would revolt at &s;uch an idea. It will therefore be &s;een that, at the time of SHAKESPEAR, of BET|TERTON, of CIBBER, and of GARRICK, a union of abilities upon an enlarged &s;cale gave a con&s;equence and a re&s;pect to the theatre and to acting, and that at every other period it was chilled and di&s;couraged and hid its dimini&s;hed head.</P>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider when acting was in its greate&s;t pro&s;perity, and I think it will not be diffi|cult to prove that moment to have been at the time of GARRICK; and, upon the whole, after his re|turn from Italy. His great example had been long operating on the minds of others, and, when p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ac|tice had grown into maturity, every point of excel|lence
<PB N="326" REF="330">
appears to have been attained. We are told that BETTERTON was taught by TAYLOR, BOOTH by BETTERTON, and QUIN by BOOTH. GARRICK, however, &s;eems only to have been taught by nature; and, in &s;pight of all we can gather of the extraordi|nary merits of SHAKESPEAR's cotemporary actors, of tho&s;e afterwards under BETTERTON, and onward to the end of CIBBER's management, there does not appear a demon&s;trative rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that acting reached its con&s;ummation till the appear|ance of GARRICK</P>
<P>That GARRICK reached perfection, as far as it is in the power of a human being to be perfect, no|thing can controvert. Nature had given him a mo&s;t intelligent and comprehen&s;ive mind; he knew the pa&s;&s;ions and all their di&s;tinctions, &s;hades and gradations, to infinity. He knew all his author expre&s;&s;ed, all he meant, and was frequently equal to a penetration capable of refining upon the &s;enti|ment he had to utter; &s;o that, let the thought be ever &s;o beautiful, ever &s;o greatly conceived, or ad|mirably written, it came mended from his utterance of it.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t this &s;trong, ju&s;t, and profound judge|ment, his per&s;on and face were capable of &s;etting off
<PB N="327" REF="331">
every character, and every mode of expre&s;&s;ion to ad|vantage; and &s;o great was his command over his form and his features, that the extremes of per&s;oni|fication, from kingly dignity to driveling idioti&s;m, were at his command; but it is enough to &s;ay, for his fame needs no eulogium, or if it did is it in the power of words to give it, that from the mo|ment he was dre&s;&s;ed for a part to the time he laid it down, be it what it might, he was no longer GARRICK, but the character he a&s;&s;umed: but one part of his acting, which can be ea&s;ily explained, and which it is not only the duty, but within the capacity, of every member of the theatre to acquire, was his correct attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;cene when others were &s;peaking to him.</P>
<P>The meane&s;t performer on the &s;tage in this can copy GARRICK. The rules which he laid down for him&s;elf were, not to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ingle auditor pre|&s;ent; and, not only to fancy he was the character he per&s;onated, but actually to infu&s;e into his mind an idea that every thing he &s;aw, heard, and felt, was real. He leered at no ladies in the boxes; con|templated no plea&s;ure in any appointment to be kept after the play; anticipated no hired panegyric in the papers of the next morning; the admiration he received was a tribute from the &s;en&s;ibility of the
<PB N="328" REF="332">
audience; he realized the fiction; till, at length, all idea of a theatre vani&s;hed, and his hearers were willingly deluded into a belief that they were wit|ne&s;&s;ing &s;cenes in real life; for, critically attentive to the&s;e particulars him&s;elf, which make half the value of the repre&s;entation, the other performers caught the fervor, which, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf to all around, through the medium of a play, the &s;tage exhibited a faithful repre&s;entation of nature.</P>
<P>To enumerate the wonderful and exten&s;ive vari|ety in GARRICK, throughout the whole round of different characters he a&s;&s;umed, which for number, &s;tyle, or kind, are beyond credibility, would require volumes. The ta&s;k however, though the fact is a&s;toni&s;hing, would not be difficult. Tho&s;e who have &s;een him mu&s;t remember what they felt, and &s;en&s;ations that are imprinted on the mind are ea&s;ily explained. In&s;tead, therefore, of &s;aying what he was as an actor, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with de|&s;cribing what he was not. In his utterance he was not monotonous, tedious, preci&s;e, cold, unimpa&s;|&s;ioned; nor did he rant, bellow, flounder, hoop, or &s;putter. In his deportment he was not affected, formal, lounging, languid, or awkward; nor did he &s;tride, &s;talk, jump, kick, or &s;huffle. He neither buffetted the air with his arms, nor &s;hook his head
<PB N="329" REF="333">
like a panteen; whiffled and fluttered like a but|terfly, or rolled about like a porpus.</P>
<P>His conduct was not di&s;re&s;pectful to the audience, nor di&s;reputable to him&s;elf; he excited attention, but he did not exact it; though his judgement was con&s;ummate, he always &s;ubmitted it with deference; he never appeared &s;olicitous to inve&s;tigate a &s;en|tence, but went at once to the &s;entiment it en|forced; his bu&s;ine&s;s was not to methodize words, but to expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ions; he never was pertinacious, pedantic, or critical; he neither whined nor de|claimed; he acted. In a word, what he uttered &s;eemed to be without &s;tudy; it &s;eemed to be extem|poraneous words ari&s;ing from the &s;ituation con|ceived at the time, upon the &s;pot. Thus his acting could be no other than nature, and thus he excited no cavil upon the meaning of epithets, no creation of opinions, no deriliction of under&s;tanding; his power was unequivocally over the heart. In proof of this, in the cour&s;e of all that unexampled variety of characters which he per&s;onated, combining all the &s;ituations into which the human pa&s;&s;ions can po&s;&s;ibly be thrown, he never for a &s;ingle moment inflated tragedy into bomba&s;t, nor degraded comedy into buffoonery.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="334">This negative &s;tatement &s;hews the requi&s;ites which GARRICK po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in him&s;elf, and which he taught to his pupils; and I the more readily try him by this ordeal, becau&s;e it gives me opportunity to &s;hew that, by avoiding tho&s;e impediments to good acting, which if per&s;i&s;ted in are completely fatal, every member of a theatre, to that degree of ability which nature and education has given him, may be a good actor. It is on this account I therefore naturally wi&s;h that it might again be the de&s;ire of actors to emulate, and the determination of the public to tolerate, this only plan by which in the mo&s;t di&s;tant degree acting can ever be a repre&s;entation of na|ture, and reconcileable to truth.</P>
<P>I could with plea&s;ure go into every particular ex|cellence in GARRICK's acting, but that my limits are &s;o confined as to render it impracticable. Indeed it could not be done without e&s;tabli&s;hing a broad &s;y&s;tem equal to a treati&s;e; I mu&s;t leave it therefore to &s;ome more able, though not more willing pen. In the mean time, I owe my&s;elf the duty to &s;ay, and I beg it may be &s;o under&s;tood, that I have not meant to de&s;cribe, in my ob&s;ervations on this ex|traordinary man, an actor completely without faults. I only in&s;i&s;t that his faults were &s;pots in the &s;un;
<PB N="331" REF="335">
faults which the mo&s;t perfect mortal mu&s;t naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s; faults to which BETTERTON, as well as GAR|RICK, mu&s;t inevitably have been liable; and, hav|ing e&s;tabli&s;hed his perfections, which, in compari&s;on with his faults, were <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"o&s;&s;a to a wart."</Q> I think it will be acknowledged, let BETTERTON's exclu&s;ive merit have been what it might, that, as the large field which GARRICK traver&s;ed demanded more ex|ten&s;ive and more ver&s;atile powers, and as taking it in a general point of view he was equally excellent every where; it cannot be but his merits mu&s;t have &s;tood higher than tho&s;e of his great prede|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Next to GARRICK it will be proper to mention BARRY, an actor of mo&s;t extraordinary merit; which was confined, however, to tragedy, and &s;erious parts in comedies. In &s;ome few re&s;pects it is que&s;|tionable whether he did not excel every actor on the &s;tage. The&s;e were in &s;cenes and &s;ituations full of tender woe and dome&s;tic &s;oftne&s;s, to which his voice, which was melifluous to wonder, lent a&s;to|ni&s;hing a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In &s;cenes of an oppo&s;ite de&s;crip|tion, he threw a maje&s;ty and a grandeur into his acting which gave it a mo&s;t noble degree of ele|vation. The&s;e peculiar qualities which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a very &s;triking degree, were greatly manife&s;t in
<PB N="332" REF="336">
the tender conflicts of the heart wounded Othello, and the haughty ravings of the high minded Baja|zet; and they were exqui&s;itely blended in the fond, yet kingly Alexander; but certainly beyond the&s;e requi&s;ites, BARRY's acting did not extend in any eminent degree.</P>
<P>The turbulent, afflicting, and terrible pa&s;&s;ions were not at the command of BARRY, which tho&s;e will wit|ne&s;s for me who have heard GARRICK utter the cur&s;e in Lear, and who have watched him through the va|rious vici&s;&s;itudes which mark the guilty ambition of Macbeth. BARRY was wonderfully winning, but he was not &s;uperlatively great. He mi&s;&s;ed of the fir&s;t grand requi&s;ite in tragedy, he excited pity, and delight, but not terror. GARRICK po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every quality in the &s;ame eminent degree. I have noticed already that exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility conquers too fre|quently the powers of an actor, and thus BARRY felt him&s;elf what GARRICK transferred to the audience. In BARRY they were intere&s;ted for the actor, in GAR|RICK for the character.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied however that BARRY was a noble acqui&s;ition to the theatre. All exqui&s;itely tender and touching writing came mended from his mouth. There was a pathos, a &s;weetne&s;s, a
<PB N="333" REF="337">
delicacy in his utterance, which &s;tole upon the mind and forced conviction upon the memory; every &s;entiment of honour and virtue recommended to the ear by the language of the author, were ri|vetted to the heart by the utterance of BARRY.</P>
<P>HOLLAND and POWELL were great acqui&s;itions to the theatre. Their merits however were as dif|ferent as po&s;&s;ible. HOLLAND acquired fame by per&s;everance and indu&s;try, which therefore grew gradually towards perfection. POWELL bur&s;t on the &s;tage with every perfection but experience. They had been always intimate friends and their theatrical emulation was creditable to both? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is an extraordinary thing that when POWELL died HOLLAND felt a pre&s;entiment that he &s;hould &s;oon follow him. The la&s;t time he ever performed he was in unu&s;ual &s;pirits. During the evening he related in the Green-room a number of anecdotes and it is remarkable that they always contained &s;ome allu&s;ion to POWELL. He repeated the lines which COL|MAN had written and which he had repeated at POWELL's death. Every thing in &s;hort was POWELL. At la&s;t he uttered tho&s;e extraordinary words.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The fir&s;t time I ever &s;aw POWELL was at a &s;pouting club where he and I performed Po&s;thumous and Jachimo. The fir&s;t characters we performed on the &s;tage together were Po&s;thumous and Jachimo. The la&s;t time we played together, and, added he, with a &s;igh it was the la&s;t time he ever played, the characters were Po&s;thumous and Jachimo."</Q>
What makes this matter &s;ingular almo&s;t beyond belief, he was then dre&s;&s;ed for Jachimo, and he died a few days after.</NOTE>POWELL's acting was &s;trong nature, as luxuriant as a wilderne&s;s.
<PB N="334" REF="338">
It had a thou&s;and beauties, and a thou&s;and faults. He felt &s;o forcibly that, in any impa&s;&s;ioned &s;cene, tears came fa&s;ter than words, and frequently choaked his utterance. If GARRICK had not gone to Italy but had &s;tayed at home and hone&s;tly taught him, there is certainly no height of perfection, in tragedy to which &s;uch abilities could not have reached; but he hurried over &s;o many characters in the &s;hort time he was on the &s;tage, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, even had his under&s;tanding been as great as his conception, for him to have dige&s;ted any of them into any thing like form.</P>
<P>HOLLAND was extremely different from POWELL, both as an actor and a man. Though his natural talents were not &s;o &s;trong yet he kept as re&s;pectable a &s;ituation, and, through the propriety of his con|duct, his company was coveted by the wi&s;e and the celebrated, while POWELL's weakne&s;s led him into the &s;ociety of the vain and the frivolous. HOLLAND had not, nor had POWELL, received a very liberal education, but his intellects were of that &s;trong, clear, and decided kind, they performed for him the ta&s;k of a tutor &s;o well, that his deci&s;ions upon all occa&s;ions were founded in &s;ound judgment and critical experience. He was free, good natured, chearful, and generous, nor had he an unkind wi&s;h
<PB N="335" REF="339">
to any human creature: he indulged him&s;elf as much as any young man rea&s;onably ought to do; yet, with his pur&s;e and his heart ever open, though not &s;prung from an opulent origin, which circum|&s;tance he had too much &s;en&s;e to conceal, at the age, I believe, of thirty three he left his family &s;ix thou|&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>As to the acting of HOLLAND; what he wanted of POWELL's natural requi&s;ities he made up in &s;trong di&s;crimination. One was &s;u&s;ceptable, the other critical. Whoever remembers their performing Po&s;thumous and Jachimo will feel the truth of this ob&s;ervation. POWELL made the &s;tronge&s;t fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion, HOLLAND plea&s;ed you be&s;t upon repetition; POWELL, though he often charmed, &s;ometimes di&s;|gu&s;ted. HOLLAND, even when you could not ad|mire him, gave you no pain. In &s;hort POWELL owed to nature what HOLLAND owed to him&s;elf; and, if after all we are obliged to admit &s;omething of preminence on the &s;ide of POWELL, and regret his lo&s;s as an actor, we cannot refrain from heaving a deeper &s;igh when we reflect that in HOLLAND we lo&s;t a mo&s;t valuable member of &s;ociety.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Before I quit this &s;ubject, I &s;hall relate an anecdote relative to the funeral of Poor HOLLAND. He was one of FOOTE's greate&s;t favourities, perhaps in &s;ome mea&s;ure becau&s;e the world &s;aid he was the retailer of his wit; but there was no occa&s;ion, HOLLAND had wit enough of his own&mdash;be&s;ides, ARISTOPHANES dealt in the retail way him&s;elf. GEORGE GARRICK, being one of HOLLAND's executors, with his u&s;ual good nature (for no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more) undertook to manage the funeral in a way &s;uitable to his friend's circum&s;tances, for which purpo&s;e he went to Chi&s;wick, and ordered a decent vault, and &s;uch other preparations as he thought nece&s;&s;ary. HOLLAND's father was a baker. FOOTE was in|vited to the funeral, which he certainly attended with unfeigned &s;orrow; for, exclu&s;ive of his real concern for the lo&s;s of a convivial companion, whenever he had a &s;erious moment, he felt with very &s;trong &s;u&s;ceptibility. While the ceremony was performing, G. GARRICK remarked to FOOTE how happy he was, out of re&s;pect to his friend, to &s;ee every thing &s;o decently conducted. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You &s;ee,"</Q> &s;aid he,

<P><PB N="336" REF="340">ROSS and SMITH were not immediately GAR|RICK's di&s;ciples, which was a misfortune to ROSS; but SMITH's indu&s;try being always alive to his duty, he &s;ought every po&s;&s;ible opportunity of improving by a correct &s;tudy of the merit and manner of GAR|RICK. Thus have fools called HOLLAND and SMITH the copyers of GARRICK. The fair, liberal princi|ple upon which they copied him was emulation, not manner. What painter or poet ought to blu&s;h for having &s;tudied CORREGIO or DRYDEN, till he was capable of infu&s;ing the grace of the fir&s;t and the energy of the latter into his picture or poem! SMITH, greatly to his credit, &s;tudied GARRICK
<PB N="337" REF="341">
under this liberal idea; and the public in con&s;e|quence, in their commendation of perfectne&s;s, indu&s;try, attention, and gentlemanly demeanor, &s;trongly applauded tho&s;e particular merits in this actor, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and pa&s;&s;ed by trifling im|pediments, which could not be called faults, with the candour due to warm devotion and active ex|ertion.</P>
<P>ROSS was an object of much greater &s;everity. His indolence and &s;upinene&s;s were intolerable, and unpardonable, for he certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very &s;trong requi&s;ites as an actor; but CHURCHILL, throughout the Ro&s;ciad, did not write better truth, or &s;tronger &s;atire, than the two lines applied to this performer; yet, who &s;hall deny that ROSS was &s;ometimes, and to his di&s;grace, at will, captivating, and fairly able to &s;tand up to BARRY? Whoever has by chance &s;een him in his be&s;t moods perform E&s;&s;ex, or Alexander, will agree with me. In &s;hort, he was a voluptuous man, and particularly a great eater, therefore he had not the per&s;everence to give the nece&s;&s;ary atten|tion to his profe&s;&s;ion, and thus he happened to be admirable, or in&s;ufferable, in proportion as he was more or le&s;s plethoric.</P>
<P>In comedy, as in tragedy, GARRICK led the train;
<PB N="338" REF="342">
nay, take it all in all, it is difficult to &s;ay whether Thalia and Melpomene po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him or he either of them with greater ardour, for his devotion to each was equally &s;incere, and they were to him equally propitious. No wonder then, with &s;uch a &s;timulus, the actors of his day were emulous to at|tain the &s;ame perfection according to the force of their re&s;pective abilities, which were &s;o various and exten&s;ive that it is difficult to &s;ay who merits the fir&s;t notice. I &s;hall therefore take them according to &s;eniority.</P>
<P>WOODWARD, though indifferently gifted by na|ture, except as to his per&s;on, which was &s;o complete that he could not throw him&s;elf into an inelegant at|titude, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;ound principles of acting, that he is for ever to be regretted. There are characters in real life which appear out of nature. The&s;e are fair game for authors; and, when they are well drawn, did we not meet with performers of the ad|mirable de&s;cription of WOODWARD, we &s;hould lo&s;e the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;uch characters well acted. The&s;e characters are not general, but particular na|ture, and therefore it requires &s;trong art and judge|ment to delineate them. The great point is to &s;teer between extravagance and vapidity, a know|ledge of effect completely under&s;tood by WOOD|WARD.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="343">Thus, in all the coxcombs, WOODWARD mu&s;t greatly have excelled CIBBER, who de&s;igned and originally performed them; for WOODWARD even in voice, which was the wor&s;t deduction from his merit by what I could ever under&s;tand, had the advantage, and when we con&s;ider that, &s;uperadded to the experience he had gained by &s;eeing them performed in their original manner, he had the opportunity of im|proving on them by his own ob&s;ervation, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the elegance and gracefulne&s;s of his deportment, there can be no doubt that the&s;e particular characters have never been performed to perfection but by him.</P>
<P>When we go into a &s;pecies of parts &s;till more extravagant, &s;uch as the braggart through all its gradations, nothing could have been &s;uperior to WOODWARD. BOBADIL, PAROLLES, BESSUS, and others of a &s;imilar kind never had certainly upon the whole any &s;uch repre&s;entative. I have already drawn a &s;light compari&s;on between WOODWARD and the French actor DUGAZON. The &s;uperiority how|ever is greatly on the &s;ide of WOODWARD. The French &s;tage knows nothing of that broad humour, &s;trong character, and &s;triking &s;ituation, which cha|racterize ours. They have their <HI>coups de theatre,</HI> but the general effect is full of frivolity and &s;eldom
<PB N="340" REF="344">
gets beyond &s;prightline&s;s. Their <HI>bien&s;eance</HI> is but another word for vapidity, and then if DUGAZON had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the requi&s;ites of WOODWARD, which he certainly did not in any eminent degree, the extravagance of D'ANCOURT, well drawn, as it was, could not have afforded the &s;ame opportunity for a di&s;play of his talents as WOODWARD found in SHAKESPEAR and JONSON.</P>
<P>YATES was one of tho&s;e meritorious actors who added to cha&s;te nature becoming re&s;pectability. He had his hardne&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e, who, like CHURC|HILL, cavil in parcels, and are too acrimonious to be candid, may on this account, condemn him in the lump; but I &s;hould not de&s;pair of proving that YATES had as good an under&s;tanding as CHURCHILL, and that, as an actor, he accompli&s;hed his public duty upon hone&s;ter and more re&s;pectable grounds than the other as an author.</P>
<P>I know of no French actor &s;o good as YATES; though, had he been a Frenchman, the Li&s;imons, Gerontes, and every &s;pecies of fathers and guardians characterized by humour and caprice would have been exactly in his way. He had the be&s;t parts of BONNEVAL, DESSESARTS, and BELLECOUR. On the Engli&s;h &s;tage he re&s;embled UNDERHILL; but with
<PB N="341" REF="345">
con&s;iderable advantage. No actor was ever more cha&s;te, more uniform, more characteri&s;tic; and, though perhaps &s;ometimes he over&s;hot tho&s;e par|ticular &s;pots which nature de&s;igned him to hit, yet upon the whole his acting in an eminent degree was gratifying to the public and exemplary to &s;tage.</P>
<P>SHUTER, who&s;e &s;trong nature and irre&s;i&s;tible humour were highly and peculiarly captivating, mu&s;t be ranked as a theatrical wonder. Neither on the French, nor on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, do we find any one to whom we can compare him. His &s;trong conception, his laughable manner, his perpetual diver&s;ity were his own, and were di&s;played in a thou&s;and various forms, always extraordinary, and yet always in nature. The extremes of life were never &s;o critically di&s;played as by SHUTER. His performance of the Mi&s;er and Ma&s;ter Stephen are incontrovertible proofs of this remark. Has any one &s;een him in <HI>Corbaccio,</HI> and will he tell me that acting ever went beyond it?</P>
<P>When he went out of his way, &s;o the que&s;tion was humour, could any thing be &s;uperior to SHUTER? I look upon him, as far as it went, to have been one of the be&s;t burletta &s;ingers in the
<PB N="342" REF="346">
world. Nothing upon earth could have been &s;u|perior to his Midas. His great fault was indolence; but eccentric qualities will naturally be accompanied by eccentric conduct. Thus we perceive in his acting great inequalities, but tho&s;e parts of it that were &s;terling were invaluably &s;o; and, in proof of it, &s;ee all tho&s;e vain attempts at an imitation of him from EDWIN onwards that have degraded acting into buffoonery, of which SHUTER had none, through which even actors of good &s;en&s;e have ex|pected to grow into reputation, till mi&s;taking the way, they have made a &s;ort of JOSEPH's coat of their acting; and, in proportion as they have pur|&s;ued manner, have lo&s;t &s;ight of nature.</P>
<P>WESTON was another of nature's wonders. He &s;eemed as if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither idea, nor conception, yet was he endowed with &s;o many cha&s;te and felicitous gifts, that he uttered rather than acted; but it was &s;uch utterance that the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed acting never excelled. The French know nothing of actors &s;uch as SHUTER and WESTON. Their <HI>naivet&eacute;</HI> bears an implication that de&s;erts &s;implicity and almo&s;t goes to cunning. The ideas of the French in any one part of their con|duct, either on or off the &s;tage, are never inarti|ficial. They inhale caution, warine&s;s, and di&s;tru&s;t,
<PB N="343" REF="347">
with their earlie&s;t breath, and the fir&s;t u&s;e they make of their tongues is to rea&s;on, and this obtains among the very lowe&s;t de&s;criptions of that nation; there|fore, if authors fairly depict their manners, though they may find, and this will be rarely the ca&s;e, <HI>naivet&eacute;,</HI> they never will find what an ingenuous Engli&s;h mind under&s;tands by the word &s;implicity.</P>
<P>NOKES, and NORRIS, as I have noticed already, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;imilar gifts to WESTON; whether in an equal degree it will be impo&s;&s;ible for us to a&s;certain; in a &s;uperior degree it will be impo&s;&s;ible for us to allow; but many of my readers have &s;een him in Scrub, Dr. La&s;t, and other characters, and I have nothing to do but appeal to their evidence to make out my a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>FOOTE ranked re&s;pectably as an actor, a circum|&s;tance that has not been always granted; for, as peoples principles are &s;uppo&s;ed to be vitiated by keep|ing bad company, &s;o tho&s;e, who have been profe&s;&s;edly mimics, have been rarely allowed to have been good actors, which is more an admitted than a real fact. GARRICK was an incomparable mimic. Take the circum&s;tance as it really is and the truth will be this. Mimickry is the ea&s;ie&s;t thing in the world,
<PB N="344" REF="348">
acting the mo&s;t difficult; for, if this were not ad|mitted, tho&s;e who imitate cats, dogs, and birds, as well as all the race of ventriloqui&s;ts and mummers of every de&s;cription, would naturally be good actors. On the contrary, acting mu&s;t have conception, &s;oul, &s;en&s;ibility, and all tho&s;e mental qualities, which mi|mickry has nothing to do with.</P>
<P>FOOTE was by no means a good mimic. He knew &s;ingularity to be very catching, and a &s;trong recommendation with the &s;uperficial who admire more that which is merely plau&s;ible, than that which is really &s;ub&s;tantial; and therefore he put on &s;omething of this kind in order to heighten his acting: which, added to dre&s;s, an extravagant man|ner, and other artful re&s;ources, was &s;uppo&s;ed to con|vey a likene&s;s of the per&s;on repre&s;ented, who had never been &s;een by one of his auditors, perhaps, out of five hundred. There were characters, how|ever, where mimickry was totally unnece&s;&s;ary, that FOOTE performed admirably, and many of tho&s;e he wrote him&s;elf, which were not merely calculated to ridicule individuals, have not &s;ince him found adequate repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>O'BRIEN, who was &s;natched from the Theatre when he had arrived, though young, to great repu|tation,
<PB N="345" REF="349">
would certainly have proved an actor of the fir&s;t con&s;equence. The ea&s;e, elegance, and grace in his deportment were peculiar, and his own; and &s;pight of his voice, which for light characters was not by any means an impediment, in the repre&s;en|tation of a great variety of parts his acting was cri|tically natural, his manner intere&s;tingly impre&s;&s;ive, and his deportment uncommonly attractive.</P>
<P>KING, whom I formerly compared to PREVILLE, had, and I am happy, in common with every admir|er of good acting, to add, has, much more exten|&s;ive merit than had that de&s;ervedly celebrated per|former. When we &s;peak of French actors, let their intrin&s;ic merit have been what it might, we can only give them credit for that which they have manife&s;ted. PREVILLE performed all the Valets, and &s;imilar characters to &s;uch a degree of perfec|tion, that a revival of MOLIERE, and all celebrated authors was demanded to give opportunity for the di&s;play of his talents. It is impo&s;&s;ible to deny that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the words of his biographer, intelli|gence, variety, deportment, gaiety, grace, and na|ture; but, with all the&s;e admirable requi&s;ites, he could not perform more than what was given him; fortunately enough perhaps, for, as on the French Stage it is a proverb that Harlequin is always Har|lequin,
<PB N="346" REF="350">
and Cri&s;pin always Cri&s;pin, &s;o PREVILLE was always PREVILLE, and indeed, &s;o are French actors always French actors; and the que&s;tion is not &s;o much how they would manage if they were tru&s;t|ed with contra&s;t, variety, and diver&s;ity, as how they are capable of contra&s;ting, varying, and diver&s;ifying the eternal &s;amene&s;s of &s;entiment and &s;ituation which pervade the mo&s;t perfect pieces on the French Stage.</P>
<P>LE KAIN has been compared to GARRICK, &s;o has PREVILLE; but the hi&s;torian, in fair ju&s;tice, is obliged to confe&s;s, of the fir&s;t, that, however, the French actor had ta&s;te, and knew how to &s;upport effect, the Engli&s;h actor had the &s;uperiority on the &s;ide of nature; and, as to the other, that GARRICK performed with equal celebrity, tragedy, and come|dy, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile on the French Stage. A confe&s;&s;ion that &s;ufficiently explains the confined ideas of acting on their theatre.</P>
<P>If PREVILLE, therefore, was to cope with KING, it could be only as to the Valets, for in no other way have they performed parts at all &s;imilar; and when it is given, which it ea&s;ily will be, that the French Stage knows no characters of that de&s;cription which require tho&s;e powers of acting that are nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="347" REF="351">
in the performance of Trapanti, Bra&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am aware that Bra&s;s is French, but D'ANCOURT's Frontin and VANBURGH's Bra&s;s, are greatly different in point of value.</NOTE> Tom, and various other parts on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, the having &s;tronger &s;ituation to manage, better humour to expre&s;s, and &s;ounder effect to convey, calls for greater talents, and we are obliged to allow the &s;uperiority to incline according as we are bia&s;&s;ed by the evidence of our &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>When we go further, and point to &s;uch cha|racters as Touch&s;tone, Malvolio, all the bucks, &s;uch as Squire Groom and Sir Harry Beagle, to which I could add a prodigious number of others in various ways, but &s;hall however content my&s;elf with mentioning Sir Peter Teazle, Sir Anthony Ab&s;olute, and Lord Ogleby, which may now be witne&s;&s;ed in as great perfection as ever, and to which every actor of the pre&s;ent day ought to bow out of devotion as to a precious relick, it would be folly any longer to talk of a compari&s;on between KING and PREVILLE. Good Engli&s;h acting is like Engli&s;h punch of which the French know nothing but the lemonade.</P>
<P>It is as difficult to liken KING to any Engli&s;h
<PB N="348" REF="352">
actor. Tho&s;e who performed characters in his &s;tyle at the time of CIBBER &s;eem to have been fol|lowed by YATES, who, though he was, as I have with plea&s;ure ob&s;erved, an admirable actor, had a manner perfectly di&s;tinct. KING is a performer who has thrown novelty into old characters, con|&s;equence into new, and nature into all. Indeed his leading feature is integrity; which quality having been invariably his guide during his whole public and private conduct, he has mo&s;t re&s;pectably endeared him&s;elf to the world in general by a di&s;|play of truth, and nature from the &s;tage, and to a large circle of admiring friends by an exerci&s;e of benevolence, good humour, and every other &s;ocial virtue.</P>
<P>I lament that I cannot dwell more particularly on the merit of actors. ARTHUR was an actor of con&s;iderable merit, HAVARD and BERRY demand a tribute of re&s;pect, SPARKS, DYER, COLLINS, MARTIN, and even BURTON, BRANSBY, VAUG|HAN and many others claim a right to be &s;poken of as reputable members of the theatre.</P>
<P>AICKIN has performed at all times with judg|ment, feeling and nature. His information being exten&s;ive, his knowledge profound, and his di&s;|crimination
<PB N="349" REF="353">
critical, he has often delighted, and never offended; and, though he has not reached the &s;ummit of his profe&s;&s;ion, he has maintained the height at which he arrived, by no means a mediocre &s;tation, firm and un&s;haken; his guide under&s;tanding, and his &s;upport good &s;en&s;e. The two PALMERS were actors of great merit; the only drawback on both was manner which in the fir&s;t was too refined, and in the other too vulgar. PARSONS, and DODD, mu&s;t be &s;poken of with warmth. Both the&s;e actors were favourites with GARRICK. The di&s;crimination of PARSONS, in parents and guardians, was his own, and he went over this walk in a manner perfectly original, which was the more admirable coming as he did after YATES; be&s;ides he had trea&s;ured up a great fund of knowledge, and was capable of &s;peaking with ta&s;te and judgment to every que&s;tion concerning the arts, a congenial feeling with tho&s;e enlarged ideas which particularly belong to acting. DODD's great merit was altogether &s;ingularity; which, guided by a perfect knowledge of his profe&s;&s;ion, rendered his exertions very re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o other actors who largely contributed to the reputation of the &s;tage, BLAKES, BADDE|LEY, and even HOLTAM, &s;upported the characters
<PB N="350" REF="354">
of Frenchmen with great reputation. Nor was their merit confined merely to that ca&s;t of parts. MOODY's genteel, and BARRINGTON's blackguard, Iri&s;hmen, were excellent, and much might be &s;aid to &s;hew that there was at that time &s;carcely a wheel in the theatrical machine that was not of material u&s;e in contributing towards the re|gular, correct, and con&s;tant rotation of the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>I cannot with any propriety fini&s;h this chapter without noticing that REDDISH, WROUGHTON, HENDERSON, WILSON, LEE LEWIS, and many others were performers of con&s;iderable merit, and it would give me real &s;atisfaction to go particularly into an account of their various talents; but, as they do not properly come under my promi&s;e, and as the earlie&s;t parts of an actors exertions are not &s;o favourable to report as tho&s;e when his repu|tation becomes more confirmed, in which &s;ituation all tho&s;e whom I have mentioned above &s;tand, it will be better for them, and more becoming in me, to let the judgment on their merits re&s;t with the public, by whom many of them are now remem|bered with plea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. ACTRESSES.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;poken of actre&s;&s;es in tragedy who &s;u&s;|tained the fir&s;t &s;ituations before GARRICK went to Italy, I &s;hall now dwell a little upon tho&s;e who &s;trove to fill their vacant places after his return.</P>
<P>Mrs. YATES was a performer of extraoardinary merit. If &s;he had a fault it was an emulation of the be&s;t French actre&s;&s;es; which gave a declamatory air to her delivery, but in her it was le&s;s a fault than it could have been in any other actre&s;s, becau&s;e her voice was &s;o wonderfully well calculated for this part of acting, that what would have appeared monotonous in any other was in her penetrating to admiration. In all the complaints of &s;uffering innocence, &s;he was pathetically affecting; her me|lancholy and de&s;pondency excited generous pity,
<PB N="352" REF="356">
and her grief was repaid with the tear of commi|&s;eration.</P>
<P>This however was not the boundary to her act|ing. In &s;cenes of animated pa&s;&s;ion and haughty fiercene&s;s, her manner was commanding and her expre&s;&s;ion maje&s;tic. She had all the grand and noble requi&s;ities of tragedy in great perfection. If &s;he per&s;onated pride, &s;he maintained it even in di&s;|appointment. If greatne&s;s, &s;he never lo&s;t &s;ight of its dignity however fallen. Her merits were in the nature of tho&s;e of BARRY. Her queens were full of elevation, and her lovers of &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility, but here we mu&s;t &s;top. Grandeur and tenderne&s;s com|prized the whole of her talents; the intermediate pa&s;&s;ions had nothing to do with them; they en|tirely con&s;i&s;ted of the power to awe her auditors into admiration, or melt them into tears.</P>
<P>Mrs. BARRY had more of GARRICK's merit in tragedy and was equal to quickne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ion, rage and an expo&s;ition of all the terrible and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions. Common grief was too tame for her ex|pre&s;&s;ion. She knew not how to in&s;inuate her&s;elf into the heart, her mode was to &s;eize it. Admir|ation was not enough; &s;he mu&s;t beget a&s;toni&s;hment. This difficult effect it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed her acting
<PB N="353" REF="357">
very often produced; but it &s;eldom happens that &s;uch bold and forcible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">rokes of art are free from inequality. It required GARRICK's perfectne&s;s in a conception of all the pa&s;&s;ions to be excellent in the&s;e; be&s;ides turbulent men may be admitted, but turbulent women are unlovely and lo&s;e &s;omething of feminine delicacy.</P>
<P>Mrs. PRITCHARD was perhaps the only actre&s;s who had art enough to reconcile the&s;e jarring in|tere&s;ts. She was every where great, every where impre&s;&s;ive, and every where feminine. Mrs. BARRY was &s;ometimes below and &s;ometimes above the &s;tandard; &s;ometimes, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, vulgar, and &s;ometimes, I may truly &s;ay, wonderful. To &s;peak truth there could not be two actre&s;&s;es who were &s;o well calculated to &s;et off the perfections of each other as Mrs. YATES, and Mrs. BARRY. The hiatus created by Mrs. YATES the powers of Mrs. BARRY were exactly &s;uited to fill, and perhaps, though I will not allow one to be completely equal, taken &s;eperately, to Mrs. PRITCHARD in Jane Shore, or the other to Mrs. CIBBER in Alicia, yet their acting &s;o exactly &s;orted together, and there was by means of contract &s;o peculiar a felicity in its operation, that it is difficult to believe the public ever &s;aw better collective effect than in
<PB N="354" REF="358">
tho&s;e characters which were &s;o often performed by Mrs. YATES and Mrs. BARRY.</P>
<P>The&s;e two actre&s;&s;es engro&s;&s;ed the principal repu|tation in their time; Mrs. WARD, Mi&s;s MACKLIN, Mrs. HAMILTON, Mi&s;s BRIDE, Mrs. FITZHENRY and others, had done the &s;tate &s;ome &s;ervice; but, either at that time had di&s;appeared or were di&s;appearing. Mrs. WARD had many excellent requi&s;ites but &s;he was unequal, almo&s;t as unequal as ROSS. She per|formed, however, at times to admiration, and would have &s;ucceeded better had &s;he not been at Covent Garden, where the play was generally neglected for the pantomime, and would have been performed to empty benches for the fir&s;t half of it, had not RICH e&s;tabli&s;hed a rule to admit no auditor during any part of the evening at le&s;s than full price.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s MACKLIN performed at times re&s;pectably, but &s;he was a parrot, and uttered what had been taught her by her father, as a ta&s;k got by heart, which &s;he &s;eemed to have neither ta&s;te nor inclina|tion for. Mrs. HAMILTON, the &s;tock Covent-Gar|den Queen, had a bu&s;tling &s;omething in her man|ner that might have been endured, if the pub|lic had not been accu&s;tomed to Mrs. PRITCHARD. As to Mi&s;s BRIDE, &s;he retired &s;o ha&s;tily ftom the
<PB N="355" REF="359">
Stage, that there was no forming any judgment of what &s;he would have been, had &s;he remained; and for Mrs. FITZHENRY, &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the Shannon to ex|hibit a new &s;pecies of acting, which, captivating as it might be in Ireland, was not reli&s;hed here. The reader will excu&s;e me from mentioning inferior ac|tre&s;&s;es to the&s;e in tragedy, who, however, let their natural requi&s;ites have been what they might, always &s;ucceeded be&s;t in proportion as they &s;tudied in the &s;chool of GARRICK.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not, however, forget to notice Mi&s;s YOUNGE, afterwards Mrs. POPE. GARRICK had al|ways what he u&s;ed to call a bi&s;que in his &s;leeve, which was a &s;troke of policy u&s;eful both to him and to the theatre. It was no other, than to fix upon an object of merit, in order to curb other performers, when he either knew or fancied their conduct was likely to grow overbearing, or in any other way trouble&s;ome. REDDISH was produced in this man|ner to awe POWELL, and Mi&s;s YOUNGE was produced to le&s;&s;en the con&s;equence of Mrs. BARRY.</P>
<P>With this lady GARRICK took mo&s;t uncommon pains. It was not, however, till after a variety of experiments that &s;he gained that hold of the public, which &s;he long and de&s;ervedly kept. It is needle&s;s
<PB N="356" REF="360">
to &s;ay what were her particular merits, they are too recently in the recollection of the public, to be ea&s;ily forgot. They had to the la&s;t a &s;pice of her pre|ceptor, and even her manner of filling the &s;tage, gave a &s;trong idea of &s;tage conduct in u&s;e five and thirty years ago.</P>
<P>As to actre&s;&s;es in comedy, Mrs. CLIVE maintain|ed an undimini&s;hed reputation till &s;he took leave of the public, which was in 1768. She had then lived to &s;ee her pupils, Mrs. GREEN, and Mi&s;s POPE, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of high public favour; both of whom, however, were by no means manneri&s;ts. Nature had largely furni&s;hed them with mental wealth; the experience of Mrs. CLIVE had only &s;hewn them how to lay it it out to advantage. Thus, though they were both admirable in Chambermaids and Hoydens, and indeed almo&s;t every other comic part, they were neither like each other, nor like their principal, though perfectly and always in nature.</P>
<P>Mrs. GREEN had humour, even to drollery. She had &s;omething of SHUTER, and &s;omething of her fa|ther. The&s;e were not exactly the talents of Mi&s;s POPE; who, however, though perfectly unaffected her&s;elf, exceeded Mrs. GREEN in a&s;&s;uming fine&s;&s;e and affectation. Perhaps, Mrs. CLIVE never aped
<PB N="357" REF="361">
mock gentility better. I cannot conceive how the Aunt and the Niece in the <HI>Clande&s;tine Marriage</HI> can ever again be per&s;onated to the &s;ame degree of per|fection; but to dwell upon comparative excellence is next to cavilling. Some of my readers remember Mrs. CLIVE, many Mrs. GREEN, and all Mi&s;s POPE. To the fir&s;t of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es my remarks will be recog|ni&s;ed for truth, as they relate to tho&s;e three perform|ers; to the &s;econd, as they regard the two la&s;t; and the third, in the characters Mi&s;s POPE has now the good &s;en&s;e to perform, will have a ju&s;t and a faithful idea of the manner in which parts of that de|&s;cription were acted before boldne&s;s and vul|garity u&s;urped the place of truth and nature.</P>
<P>With Mrs. ABINGTON came a &s;pecies of excel|lence which the Stage &s;eems never before to have boa&s;ted in the &s;ame perfection. The higher parts in comedy had been performed cha&s;tly and truely, perhaps in the&s;e particulars more &s;o than by this ac|tre&s;s. There was a peculiar goodne&s;s gleamed acro&s;s the levity of Mrs. PRITCHARD, and by what we can learn of Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, who &s;eems to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame captivating &s;ort of manner which di&s;tingui&s;hed Mrs. ABINGTON, &s;he was in the&s;e characters natural and winning; but it re|mained for her &s;ucce&s;&s;or to add a degree of grace,
<PB N="358" REF="362">
fa&s;hion, and accompli&s;hment to &s;prightline&s;s, which was no &s;ooner &s;een, than it was imitated in the po|lite&s;t circles.</P>
<P>Mrs. BRACEGIRDLE, let her merit have been what it might, did not perform CIBBER's coquettes; and though that author waited for Mrs. OLDFIELD be|fore he accompli&s;hed Lady Betty Modi&s;h, yet, however admirable &s;he might have been in the re|pre&s;entation of tho&s;e characters, they did not ap|pear to be &s;o exactly in her way, as Lady Townly and other parts which had a higher degree of con|&s;equence attached to them. Mrs. ABINGTON kept critically to coquettes, and there can be no doubt, take the round of them through, and it is pretty ex|ten&s;ive, that more uniform good acting never was manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>I have already &s;poken comparatively of Mrs. ABINGTON, and Madame BELLCOUR; but with no view to a&s;&s;ociate them in elegance and grace, which the characters Madame BELLCOUR per&s;onated would not in the &s;ame degree admit of. The French ac|tre&s;s per&s;onated French coquettes to admiration, but I have already ob&s;erved, &s;peaking of KING and PREVILLE, that every thing among the French is underwritten. They know nothing of Beatrice,
<PB N="359" REF="363">
Lady Betty Modi&s;h or Millamant. The likene&s;s is in tho&s;e higher kind of chambermaids who aped their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and thus exactly, as we have been accu&s;tomed to &s;ay KING and ABINGTON, in&s;tead of Tom and Phillis, &s;o it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak of PREVILLE without a&s;&s;imilating the idea of BELLCOUR.</P>
<P>In addition to the grace, the ea&s;e, and the ele|gance, with which Mrs. ABINGTON per&s;onated characters in high life, and aped politene&s;s in cham|bermaids, her ta&s;te for dre&s;s was novel and inte|re&s;ting. She was con&s;ulted by ladies of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, not from caprice as we have frequently &s;een in other in&s;tances, but from a decided con|viction of her judgment in blending what was beautiful with what was becoming. Indeed dre&s;s took a &s;ort of ton from her fancy, and ladies, both on the &s;tage and off, piqued them&s;elves on decorating their per&s;ons with decency and decorum, and captivating beholders by a mode&s;t conceal|ment of tho&s;e charms, which, in imitation of the French women, who never knew the &s;en&s;ation or a blu&s;h, the re&s;ult of Engli&s;h feminine rectitude, our females now, to the di&s;grace of the age, make it their &s;tudy to expo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="364">Mi&s;s ELLIOT was a charming act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s. Maria in the <HI>Citizen</HI> certainly never was properly re|pre&s;ented but by her. Indeed the different cha|racters which &s;he performed with WOODWARD after his return from Ireland were admirably &s;u&s;tained, and a few years would certainly have marked her as a very accompli&s;hed actre&s;s, had not her early death deprived the &s;tage of a mo&s;t valuable ornament.</P>
<P>I might with great propriety &s;peak of other actre&s;&s;es and it would give me plea&s;ure to dwell on their various merits; but to mention tho&s;e who were, at the time I am confined to, mere novices, would be to place them in a di&s;advanta|geous point of view, and to notice others, who, though re&s;pectable, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only &s;econdary &s;itu|ations, it would be difficult to know where to &s;top.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. SINGERS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH I &s;hould conceive that I have &s;aid every thing on the &s;ubject of mu&s;ic it&s;elf and its com|po&s;ers, that can be requi&s;ite, or indeed that ought to occupy a place in this work, it &s;till remains for me to &s;peak of &s;ingers. I &s;hall however confine my&s;elf to Engli&s;h &s;ingers, many of whom have at different periods po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed admitted reputation equal to the Italians, and real reputation &s;uperior to them.</P>
<P>Though we know of ARABELLA HUNT, Mrs. TOFTS, Mrs. ROBINSON, and many other celebrated Engli&s;h female &s;ingers, we are not &s;o correct as to men, and the rea&s;on is, that nothing in the way of public &s;inging has been con&s;idered of con&s;equence enough to record, except what related to the opera.
<PB N="362" REF="366">
Ma&s;ques however had been performed with great celebrity; and, when the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> begat &s;o many mu&s;ical pieces, the theatre gave &s;uch a tone of &s;implicity to Engli&s;h mu&s;ic, that not only cele|brated &s;ingers began to be known, but tho&s;e who had before conceived it indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to be mu&s;icians profe&s;&s;ionaly, in order to attain reputation as &s;ingers, were a&s;toni&s;hed to find that a good voice, a correct ear, a little feeling, and an un|affected utterance embraced the whole my&s;tery.</P>
<P>Every actor furni&s;hed with the&s;e materials be|came pre&s;ently a &s;inger. The public began to feel in&s;tead of admire, and that admiration which had &s;o di&s;graced Engli&s;h manline&s;s into effeminacy by lavi&s;hing &s;o much money and &s;o much prai&s;e on the treble of FARINELLI, turned all at once into applau&s;e at the ba&s;s of LEVERIDGE. As, however, it will better an&s;wer my purpo&s;e to bring before the reader's view tho&s;e &s;ingers whom &s;ome of them may remember, I &s;hall take the period when BEARD, and Mrs. CIBBER, were &s;o greatly cele|brated, and carry the &s;ubject as far onward as will elucidate what I think it material to &s;ay upon this head.</P>
<P>BEARD was a &s;inger of great excellence. His
<PB N="363" REF="367">
voice was &s;ound, male, powerful, and exten&s;ive. His tones were natural and he had flexibility enough to execute any pa&s;&s;ages however difficult, which ta&s;k indeed frequently fell to his lot in &s;ome of HANDEL's oratorios; but, with the&s;e qualifications, where the feelings were mo&s;t rou&s;ed, he was, of cour&s;e, the mo&s;t excellent. If he failed at all it was in acquired ta&s;te, which I will venture to pronounce was a mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tance for him; for I never knew an in&s;tance where acquired ta&s;te did not de&s;troy natural expre&s;&s;ion; a quality &s;elf-evidently as much preferable to the other as nature is to art.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid that I con&s;ider BEARD, taken altogether, as the be&s;t Engli&s;h &s;inger. He was one of tho&s;e you might fairly try by SHAKESPEAR's &s;peech to the actors. He did not mouth it, but his words came trippingly over the tongue; he did not out HEROD HEROD, but he begot a temperance that gave his exertions &s;moothne&s;s; he never out|&s;tepped the mode&s;ty of nature, nor made the judi|cious grieve; in &s;hort he never did more than was &s;et down for him, he never &s;et on a quantity of barren &s;pectators to applaud while &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary que&s;tion of the &s;ong &s;tood &s;till; he let his own di&s;cretion be his tutor, and held the mirror up to
<PB N="364" REF="368">
nature. Well might one apo&s;trophize in imitation of <HI>Hamlet.</HI></P>
<P>Oh there be &s;ingers that I have li&s;tened to, and heard others applaud, aye, and encore too, that neither having the accent of Eunuch, man, or bea&s;t, yet a mixture of all three, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ingle trait of fancy, ta&s;te, or expre&s;&s;ion, have &s;o &s;oared, &s;o &s;unk, and &s;o cantabileed, that one would have thought &s;ome Ventriloqui&s;t had made &s;ingers, and not made them well, they imitated braying &s;o abominably. BEARD was the rever&s;e of all this; be&s;ides he was very valuable as an actor. In the <HI>Jovial Crew, Love in a Village, Comus, and Artaxerxes,</HI> he gave proof of this in a degree &s;carcely inferior to any body.</P>
<P>LOWE was a great favourite and perhaps had a more even and mellow voice than BEARD; and, in mere love &s;ongs when little more than a melodious utterance was nece&s;&s;ary, he might have been &s;aid to have exceeded him, but it was in the nature of tho&s;e particulars, in a much inferior degree how|ever, that BARRY excelled GARRICK. LOWE lo&s;t him&s;elf beyond the namby pamby poetry of Vauxhall; BEARD was at home ever where.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="369">Coming forwarder we get to VERNON; a mo&s;t po|werful in&s;tance of what good &s;en&s;e does for a &s;inger. He had no voice, without which quality it is difficult to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;inger at all, and it is impo&s;&s;ible that he could have arrived to any degree of reputation had he not been favoured by nature with &s;trong conception, quick &s;en&s;ibility, and a correct ta&s;te. With the&s;e and nothing more, he made him&s;elf a mo&s;t re&s;pectable favourite, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to hear him without &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"what an admirable &s;inger that man would have been, had his voice been equal to his judgment."</Q> VERNON be&s;ides this was a good actor.</P>
<P>REINHOLD, who did not &s;ucceed &s;o well, will &s;olve this &s;eeming paradox relative to VERNON, and &s;hew clearly how much natural expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t in|variably triumph over acquired ta&s;te. REINHOLD was a good mu&s;ician, and not a bad actor, he was really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a voice, not however of the fir&s;t rate, but, taking the road in which &s;o many &s;ingers have been bewildered, leaving the manly part of &s;inging for the le&s;s natural qualification of modulating through all the meanders of <HI>falcetto,</HI> he injured his reputation and rendered tho&s;e gifts of nature con|temptible which in VERNON would have commanded re&s;pect. It is con&s;idered as a very curious thing
<PB N="366" REF="370">
that the be&s;t &s;ingers in all countries, have been, generally &s;peaking, the wor&s;t mu&s;icians, but no|thing can be ea&s;ier to explain. Voices utter melo|dies, and melodies are not the &s;cience it&s;elf, but the principle on which it is formed.</P>
<P>MANZOLI, and LOVATINI, were the be&s;t &s;ingers on the Italian &s;tage; BEARD, VERNON and BAN|NISTER on the Engli&s;h.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MANZOLI and GUARDUCCI were competitors in Italy. The public were to determine which &s;ung be&s;t. MANZOLI had the voice of the &s;pectators, GUARDUCCI of the mu&s;icians; what was the con&s;equence? MANZOLI made a fortune every where, GUARDUCCI did nothing any where.</NOTE></P>
<P>BANNISTER was in many re&s;pects &s;uperior to any &s;inger that perhaps ever lived. The body and volume of voice which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were only equalled by its &s;weetne&s;s and intere&s;t. He had as much ta&s;te, as much playfulne&s;s, and as exten&s;ive power as the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable of tho&s;e &s;ingers who think &s;inging totally con&s;i&s;ts in flexibility, and that a voice cannot be exerci&s;ed to perfection unle&s;s when it is flying to the bridge of the fiddle, and &s;liding back again in chromatics; but BANNISTER had too much &s;en&s;e to u&s;e this power, except when
<PB N="367" REF="371">
he had an inclination to &s;hew how ridiculous it is. Thus in the <HI>Son-in law</HI> he &s;ung, <Q REND="inline">"Water parted from the &s;ea,"</Q> with as much ta&s;te, as much &s;weetne&s;s, and as much variety as TENDUCCI, at the &s;ame time that he introduced a degree of burle&s;que into it that gave the blu&s;h to modern &s;inging. BANNISTER had no nece&s;&s;ity to convey any thing of this extraneous kind into his general &s;inging. That was equally creditable to the poet, to the mu&s;ician, and to him&s;elf. In&s;tead of &s;urprizing, he delighted, and the fine manly accents he conveyed charmed the ear, and intere&s;ted the heart.</P>
<P>Female &s;ingers in England have been unque&s;ti|onably &s;uperior, take them all in all, to tho&s;e of any country in the world, and it is little to &s;ay that, at tho&s;e &s;everal moments the public have di&s;gracefully &s;et them&s;elves up to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of Italians, as if mu&s;ic wholly depended on them and their caprice, there were Engli&s;h women clearly of greater capacity. Every thing that happened at the time of Mrs. TOFTS, Mrs. HUNT, and Mrs. ROBINSON we'll pa&s;s by, though perhaps it might not be difficult to prove that while the&s;e were neg|lected for CUZZONI, and FAUSTINA, and others according to the times when they appeared, it was totally unnece&s;&s;ary to import Italian &s;inging and
<PB N="368" REF="372">
Italian impertinence, when &s;inging, in as great perfection, was to be found in Engli&s;h women, and mode&s;ty along with it.</P>
<P>I am confirmed in this opinion by a comparative view of the Engli&s;h and Italian female &s;ingers in my own recollection. Among the Italian, perhaps after all SESTINI was the be&s;t. I can ju&s;t remem|ber tho&s;e who came immediately before the <HI>Buonna Figliola,</HI> and it has been my uniform remark that the Italian women have &s;ung better than the men; but their plaintive &s;ingers have been the be&s;t, and and we have never heard any of their cantabile &s;ingers who piqued them&s;elves upon a large compa&s;s and the execution of difficult pa&s;&s;ages, but their tone has been &s;o na&s;al, that we might have mi&s;|taken them for the hautboy or the clarinet that accompanied them. SCOTTI was a &s;weet &s;inger, ZAMPERINI a graceful &s;inger, indeed this la&s;t was a kind of female VERNON, but what were any of them in point of voice, delicacy, and &s;weetne&s;s, compared to Mrs. ARNE, Mi&s;s BRENT, or even Mrs. VINCENT; but when we come forward and &s;peak of Mrs. SHERIDAN, and Mi&s;s HARROP, the merit of the Italian females &s;inks to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="373">I regret that I am con&s;trained to notice the dif|ferent talents of the&s;e &s;ingers in a &s;hort and general way, for I &s;hould to be glad to make out my po&s;i|tion by expatiating largely on them. Mrs. PINTO, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an exqui&s;ite voice and being under a ma&s;ter, the great characteri&s;tics of who&s;e mu&s;ical abilities were natural ea&s;e and unaffected &s;implicity, was a mo&s;t valuable &s;inger. Her power was re&s;i&s;t|le&s;s, her neatne&s;s was truly intere&s;ting and her variety was ince&s;&s;ant. Though &s;he owed a great deal to nature, &s;he owed a great deal to ARNE, without who&s;e careful hand her &s;inging might per|haps have been too luxuriant.</P>
<P>Mrs. ARNE was deliciou&s;ly captivating. She knew nothing in &s;inging or in nature but &s;weet|ne&s;s and &s;implicity. She &s;ung exqui&s;itely, as a bird does, her notes conveyed involuntary plea&s;ure and undefinable delight. It &s;hould for ever be reiterated that &s;ingers of this de&s;cription never outrage the poet nor the mu&s;ician. Indeed I conceive that there is a &s;pecies of ingratitude in &s;uch violation, for with|out the poet and the mu&s;ician what would become of the &s;inger?</P>
<P>Mrs. VINCENT, like LOWE, depended almo&s;t upon her voice which was very charming. In &s;hort
<PB N="370" REF="374">
it was that true Engli&s;h voice which has an even|ne&s;s, a fullne&s;s, a &s;olidity, that one might analize &s;o as to &s;hew that nothing Italian can have. She was de&s;ervedly a great favourite, and &s;ung &s;ongs of ea&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s with great delicacy.</P>
<P>There is a kind of voice, I will not &s;ay peculiarly Engli&s;h, but much more beautiful and perfect, and more common in England than any where el&s;e. Such a voice had Mrs. KENNEDY, who, had &s;he have been &s;uffered to keep to parts particularly adapted for her, would have augmented that public admiration &s;he &s;o meritoriou&s;ly excited to a&s;toni&s;h|ment; but, by having the good nature to per&s;onate parts totally unfit for her, a left handed policy in a manager, by the bye, who cannot keep up his real intere&s;t without keeping up the con&s;equence of the performer, we had perpetually the wor&s;t part of her &s;inging. In &s;ome light characters this conduct was particularly reprehen&s;ible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> Mrs. KENNEDY was allotted the part from which the opera takes its title, and in which &s;he was certainly re&s;pectable; but the &s;ongs were not in her voice, and in every other re&s;pect it did not &s;uit her. She ought to have performed Arbaces, which was exactly in her compa&s;s, and the different pa&s;&s;ages in the airs have a peculiar neatne&s;s which her voice was remarkably calculated to execute.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Amid a thou&s;and rack|ing woes,"</Q>
which is perhaps the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;ong in the opera, &s;he would have &s;ung with prodigious effect, for it was extraordinary that her voice had as much flexibility as volume.</NOTE> In &s;hort Mrs. KEN|NEDY
<PB N="371" REF="375">
was one of tho&s;e &s;ingers who put us in mind of the heartine&s;s of our national character, which, after fa&s;hion and folly have for a time flattered us out of it, we re&s;ume ju&s;t upon the &s;ame principle as we cheri&s;h a kind and &s;incere friend, who, forgetting our wanderings, kindly points out the road to comfort and content.</P>
<P>I could mention many other female &s;ingers of very re&s;pectable talents, who&s;e names the reader will &s;upply for me. Among the&s;e, however, I ought to confine my&s;elf to theatrical &s;ingers. I cannot help neverthele&s;s reminding the public of the great and extraordinary merit of Mi&s;s HARROP, and Mrs. SHERIDAN, both of whom were ju&s;t &s;een and then lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I own I prefer Mrs. SHERIDAN before Mi&s;s HARROP, and indeed before any &s;inger I ever heard, even to this moment; but this is no ill compliment to Mi&s;s HARROP, becau&s;e, charming and exqui&s;ite as they were, her talents were confined to concert &s;inging. The talents of Mrs. SHERIDAN, had the
<PB N="372" REF="376">
experiment been made, would been found to have been univer&s;al; but the public were not &s;o far to be obliged.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have never heard Mrs. SHERIDAN can be no more able to conceive the force and effect of her merit, than I can be capable of de&s;cribing it. I can ea&s;ily make it under&s;tood that, if &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every perfection and free from every fault as a &s;inger, &s;he mu&s;t have been &s;uperior to every other, but this is theory; the practical part of the argument cannot be felt but by tho&s;e who were fortunate enough to hear her, who, if they have any recollection and will take the trouble to repeat MILTON's pa&s;&s;age uttered by Comus imme|diately after he has heard the Lady &s;ing Sweet Echo, they will find their &s;en&s;ations were at that time delighted equal to that de&s;cription, for indeed,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;he took the pri&s;oned &s;oul and lapped it in Ely&s;ium."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;ay farther as to &s;inging, that it can|not be excellent except in proportion as it joins in corre&s;pondence, which &s;ome writer has explained to mean intelligence of the heart, with the poetry and the mu&s;ic it has to convey. Every thing ex|traneous, every thing forced, every thing in &s;hort,

as SHAKESPEAR expre&s;&s;es it, overdone, or come tardy of, though it may &s;urprize cannot delight; and, if it cannot delight, it is from the purpo&s;e of &s;inging, and though unskilful auditors may applaud, it cannot but make the judicious grieve, the cen&s;ure of one of which, mu&s;t, in the allowance of every man of &s;en&s;e, outweigh a whole theatre of others.</P>

<P>HAVING by every certain, every probable, and even every po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance, which I have con|&s;idered nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elect from tho&s;e materials I &s;up|plied my&s;elf with for this undertaking, endeavoured to draw the reader's attention to the antiquity of the &s;tage, its operation upon manners both gene|rally and ab&s;tractedly, its influence over the mind, its capability of poli&s;hing and refining our &s;ocial nature, and tho&s;e various ways, in which, in pro|portion as it is re&s;pectably and worthily conducted, it may at all times be con&s;idered as an object of na|tional importance, I &s;hall now very briefly recapi|tulate tho&s;e leading particulars which may &s;erve unerringly to demon&s;trate by what means it has at any time, and in any country lo&s;t its con&s;equence, by what means that con&s;equence has become irre|trievable,
<PB N="375" REF="379">
by what means it has, or could have been retrieved, and by what means alone it on po&s;&s;ibly be kept up and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The theatre is a &s;chool of morality, or it is no|thing. Its orginal e&s;tabli&s;hment in every country has had this broad feature. The exploits of heroes, the maxims of philo&s;ophers, and the good of man|kind were the foundation to which the fabric, even to the &s;uper&s;tructure, however fancifully it might have been ornamented, tended in all directions and as by one con&s;ent. A &s;tability of this adamantine kind could not have been confirmed but by the en|couragement of workmen of the &s;ame de&s;cription of tho&s;e who reared the &s;tructure. Who were the&s;e?

<P>Every one of the con&s;equences therefore which we are to examine are clearly traceable to this &s;ingle &s;ource, and it only remains to &s;ee whether at any time there has been &s;uch a dearth of good authors and actors as to weaken the theatre by the ab&s;ence of valuable exertions, in which ca&s;e no blame is to be any where imputed; whether good authors and actors have expected terms that were unrea&s;onable, and &s;uch as could not po&s;&s;ibly be accorded, in which ca&s;e the blame would be imputable to them;

or whether their labours have been exacted from them upon unworthy and degrading terms, in which ca&s;e common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t impute the blame to their employers; and la&s;tly to what authority authors and actors ought to be amenable.</P>
<P>Though neither Greece nor Rome are exactly ca&s;es in point as to the illu&s;tration of this argument becau&s;e in both in&s;tances the profligacy of the peo|ple brought on the moment which terminated the theatre and the country together, yet we have enough to go upon to &s;hew the&s;e po&s;itions to be critically right. In the earlier periods of Greece before comedy was generally e&s;tabli&s;hed, in &s;hort before Ari&s;tophanes, the theatre was in the hands of poets, and actors, and under the in&s;pection of Government, at which time it was as material an object in its place as the areopagus, and held as di&s;tingui&s;hed a reputation. It was managed by the great triumvirate; but this was not enough. Judges were appointed and every exhibition un|derwent an ordeal, but when Ari&s;tophanes, the mo&s;t licentious poet that ever lived, became po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;tage, it &s;oon ha&s;tened to de&s;truction for no rea&s;on upon earth but becau&s;e it was un|controuled.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="381">In Rome, the theatre could have no character becau&s;e the actors had an a&s;cendancy over the poets. It was regulated certainly, if the word could be properly be allowed me, by Government; but of what nature were the regulations? a crooked and even wicked policy by which the theatre dictated to the people as a cloak for private treachery. Even AUGUSTUS, with all his patronage and all his at|tachment to genius, tolerated rope dancers in pre|ference to poets.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h theatre for the &s;ame rea&s;on had as little character as the Roman. Tho&s;e who have read <HI>Gil Blas</HI> will &s;ee &s;ome notable proofs that poets were &s;ub&s;ervient to actors. The Portugue&s;e theatre was the &s;hadow of the Spani&s;h, the Italian theatre was a chaos of Greek and Roman rubbi&s;h, and the German theatre has as little an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of the &s;tage, owing to the uncontroled licence permitted to poets; who, though not of the breed of Ari&s;to|phanes, are neverthele&s;s as dangerous to &s;ociety, for they have tainted the manners of Europe, and in particular of England, with productions which violate probability, wound morality, terrify in&s;tead of delight, menace in&s;tead of conciliate, in &s;hort, which among every outrageous and mon&s;trous doctrine, teach filial ingratitude, encourage adultery,
<PB N="378" REF="382">
and circulate &s;uch revolting and &s;candalous tenets as thirty years ago would have been &s;purned at by an Engli&s;h audience with ineffable indignation.</P>
<P>If then we have &s;een that the conditions upon which alone the theatre can &s;tand firmly upon its true ba&s;is were only ob&s;erved for a &s;hort time in primitive Greece, at what time, and among what people, has it ever enjoyed that reputation, which, according to the doctrine here laid down, a com|bination of certain reciprocal intere&s;ts are alone capable to give it? I an&s;wer from CORNEILLE, to VOLTAIRE, almo&s;t uninteruptedly in France, and from SHAKESPEAR to 1777, in England; except during the intervals from the Re&s;toration to BET|TERTON's &s;ece&s;&s;ion, during the fluctuations, imme|diate previous to CIBBER's management; and from CIBBER's &s;ece&s;&s;ion to the 1747, when GARRICK be|came manager.</P>
<P>In France we &s;hall not find any in&s;tance when the proprietors of the theatre were managers. In|deed in general they were mere landlords, and paid by a certain rent; for the re&s;t, all which we have particularly &s;een, the managers were actors, com|mittees of whom decided upon the reception of plays into the theatre which were finally di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="379" REF="383">
of by the public; and, in every difference of opinion either concerning authors or actors, or in any other po&s;&s;ible way that could affect the in|tere&s;t of the theatre, the parties re&s;pectively had a right of appeal to court, where all grievances were redre&s;&s;ed, and that the grand object might be always obtained by &s;timulating the exertions of actors, their various merits were equitably e&s;timated, and, when at length their labours were creditably ended, it became as honourable to retire upon a pen&s;ion from the &s;tage, as from the army, or the navy.</P>
<P>The face of the Engli&s;h management during tho&s;e particular periods that I de&s;cribe wore the &s;ame a&s;pect which I have &s;ufficiently gone over in a preceding chapter and which will abundantly prove the po&s;ition I have here laid down, the mo&s;t ma|terial part of which has this tendency; that, whenever proprietors of theatres, are neither actors nor au|thors, and are no further connected with the intere&s;t of the concern than relates to the emolu|ment it produces, without being re&s;pon&s;ible for its general fame, the exertions of authors and actors will infallibly be di&s;regarded and the theatre by re|ceiving all its advantage from gewgaws and &s;pec|tacle will &s;ink from its reputation, its con&s;equence,
<PB N="380" REF="384">
and its honour, and lo&s;e its influence as a &s;chool of morality.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;hortly &s;tate a few circum&s;tances to confirm this la&s;t po&s;ition and go over &s;ome particulars rela|tive to the &s;tage, during the period between GAR|RICK's return from Italy and the di&s;po&s;al of the Drury-lane patent; after which I &s;hall take my leave of the reader.</P>
<P>My arguments go to prove that emolument alone, however obtained, has been the view of all tho&s;e who have bought into the theatres, that the fame and fortune of tho&s;e men without who&s;e exertions the &s;tage can have no legitimate preten&s;ion to pub|lic countenance, have never been properly attended to, and that therefore tho&s;e means have been con|&s;tantly re&s;orted to, however de&s;tructive to the general intere&s;t of the theatre, which are mo&s;t likely to produce the fulle&s;t hou&s;es.</P>
<P>When the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tage called for the animadver&s;ions of PRYNNE, and COLLIER the patents were held by purcha&s;ers. When CIBBER came, at which time the proprietors only received a rent, decency and decorum were re&s;tored. Dur|ing the time of HIGHMORE, FLEETWOOD, AMBER,
<PB N="381" REF="385">
and GREEN, and indeed till GARRICK, the real in|tere&s;t of the theatre was de&s;erted. Authors and actors were con&s;idered as auxiliaries rather than principals, and every &s;pecies of profligacy and di&s;|order prevailed. During the whole management of GARRICK the theatre enjoyed greater repute than ever it had known. Further than that, to be con&s;i&s;tent, I have no title to inve&s;tigate; but it is neverthele&s;s proper that I make out my po&s;ition by &s;hewing the danger that may ari&s;e from extra|neous intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Extraneous intere&s;t may ruin the theatre. It may con&s;olidate the two theatres into one general intere&s;t that may hold authors and actors at defi|ance, it may &s;tretch the two theatres into the &s;ize of four. It may pay enormous expences by laying additional charges on the benefits of authors and actors which benefits, after all, by the admi&s;&s;ion of free tickets may at la&s;t be cut to nothing. It may encourage contemptible performances, which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the new&s;papers, may be crammed down the throats of the public after being damned on the fir&s;t night. It may import foreign immo|rality and call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;hew and finery, mon&s;ters and conjurations, to the annihilation of Engli&s;h merit. All this and a great deal more it
<PB N="382" REF="386">
may do. Now let us &s;ee how &s;uch con&s;equences mu&s;t infallibly operate.</P>
<P>No theatres in the kingdom, except tho&s;e in London, produce the &s;malle&s;t novelty. If there|fore performances of this de&s;cription obtain at the two theatres, they go through the whole nation and extend to Ireland, and Scotland, and therefore are &s;ure, the &s;ource being contaminated, to poi&s;on the general ta&s;te. Thus genius, for who&s;e &s;upport &s;urely the theatres were originally intended, may retire unknown and neglected to deplore the ingra|titude of the mo&s;t benevolent country upon earth, and therefore, let the theatre be &s;upported by what|ever property it may, it can never expect any thing like permament fame, or fair reputation, unle&s;s the primary con&s;ideration be the encouragement of au|thors and actors.</P>
<P>There are yet &s;ome gleanings relative to the &s;tate of the &s;tage. It is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould no|tice by what means the que&s;tion came to be de|cided in relation to full price; which, having been originally e&s;tabli&s;hed to reimbur&s;e the expence of new pantomimes, had grown &s;o enormou&s;ly into an abu&s;e, that managers announced it when they thought proper. This at length produced a riot,
<PB N="383" REF="387">
which began at Drury-Lane, where GARRICK, with great good &s;en&s;e, redre&s;&s;ed the grievance. Covent-Garden however re&s;i&s;ted, under an idea that &s;uch performances as <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> were even more expen&s;ive than pantomimes, con&s;iderable &s;ums being upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions laid out for extra vocal and in&s;trumental performers. The public how|ever per&s;i&s;ted, and, upon BEARD's ob&s;tinacy, who was very ill advi&s;ed, they completely gutted the hou&s;e. The repairs took a fortnight out of the &s;ea&s;on; and, after a few of the ring-leaders had been impri&s;oned, and the manager had reflected on his folly, it was agreed that full price &s;hould only be allowed during the run of a new pantomine. This &s;tipulated, the hou&s;e opened with the play of <HI>All's well that Ends well,</HI> and nothing has di&s;turbed this que&s;tion &s;ince.</P>
<P>Nothing material happened after this till the di&s;|pute between the Covent Gardenman agers, a few years after their purcha&s;e of the parent. COLMAN had taken care to inve&s;t him&s;elf with &s;uch power by the in&s;trument of partner&s;hip drawn up among them, that the Court of Chancery, after a very ex|pen&s;ive &s;uit, decreed him competent to decide, without controul, upon every &s;ubject; <Q REND="inline">"for,"</Q> &s;aid Baron SMYTHE, who was one of the judges,
<PB N="384" REF="388">
the &s;eals being in commi&s;&s;ion,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"otherwi&s;e the agreement mu&s;t have meant, like Trinculo in the play, that he was to be king, and his partners were to be viceroys over him."</Q>
This di&s;pute was at length amicably adju&s;ted by the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of COLMAN, who &s;old his &s;hare to the re&s;t of the proprietors.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of FOOTE's primitive <HI>Puppet Shew,</HI> which I have already &s;poken of; FIELDING's left handed interference relative to the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> which he maintained created an additional number of thieves every time it was performed, an a&s;&s;ertion the public con&s;idered as unfounded, and a bold in|novation on their plea&s;ures; MACKLIN's mad bu&s;i|ne&s;s about REDDISH's hi&s;&s;ing him, which ended by a legal deci&s;ion in his favour, and his di&s;charge from the theatre, and GARRICK's retirement, a mo&s;t awful moment for the &s;tage, are all now which I conceive nece&s;&s;ary to notice, unle&s;s I were to go into &s;uch kind of minutie as in no re&s;pect re|gards the general management of the theatre, or in any re&s;pect its credit. I &s;hall therefore merely add, that, in 1776, GARRICK re&s;igned the concern into the hands of the pre&s;ent proprietor; and that on the twentieth of January, 1779, the world had to lament the lo&s;s of this admirable and very ex|traordinary
<PB N="385" REF="389">
man, the mo&s;t natural, the mo&s;t for|cible, the mo&s;t correct, and the mo&s;t melancholy memento, to who&s;e fame are the words which SHAKESPEAR makes Hamlet apply to his father, and which GARRICK applied to SHAKESPEAR,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We &s;hall not look upon his like again."</Q></P>
<P>To this period I confine my&s;elf as the proper boundary to a Hi&s;tory of the Stage. For my own part I will not toil any further. I have not the heart, the con&s;cience, the courage to do it; and, if any other &s;hould chu&s;e to ri&s;k the con&s;equences of pur&s;uing &s;uch a ta&s;k, I heartily wi&s;h him well through his fatigue. In my idea, the cata&s;trophe is accompli&s;hed, the play is over, and therefore I drop the curtain at the death of GARRICK; but, as the truth of this po&s;ition will be que&s;tioned, it is but fit I give the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons in my power for this conduct. I am but a &s;ervant of the pub|lic, and, born for their u&s;e, I live but to oblige them.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e then I will not incur the &s;u&s;picions of an invidious wi&s;h to wound the feelings of men who, be their abilities what they may, exert that por|tion of talents with which nature has favoured them for the rational amu&s;ement of the public; and who,
<PB N="386" REF="390">
if they fail, have frequently to thank fal&s;e ta&s;te in the encouragement of fanciful, experimental, and innovating writers, to the outrage of probability, truth, rea&s;on, and the exclu&s;ion of weeping nature and offended morality, I drop the curtain at the death of GARRICK.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, in pur&s;uing the truth and fidelity of an hi&s;torian, I will not run a ri&s;k of reiterating the mi&s;eries and theatrical troubles in the reign of FLEETWOOD, I drop the curtain at the death of GARRICK.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e I will not painfully rou&s;e my feelings to deplore that the public will not wake from their &s;upine&s;s, rally their pride, re&s;ume their judgment, and even pity their own weakne&s;s in permitting the public prints, in the place of hone&s;t truth and fair candour, to &s;et up a corrupt &s;y&s;tem of puff|ing, of palming off mi&s;erable dro&s;s for &s;terling gold, and of dictating to audiences pre&s;cribed principles by which they are arrogantly required to applaud what their duty to their pride, to their under&s;tand|ings, to their feelings, to their relatives, and to &s;o|ciety, forbids them to tolerate, I drop the curtain at the death of GARICK.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="391">La&s;tly, becau&s;e I will not go into the di&s;gracious and hateful ta&s;k, of reprobating, in merited terms, the conduct of managers in e&s;tabli&s;hing, or the want of &s;pirit in the public in permitting, coffee-rooms, lobbies, and other receptacles, for the avowed pur|po&s;e of giving opportunity to e&s;trange the affec|tions of young men from their parents, and of hu&s;bands from their wives and families, by an open, unma&s;ked, and &s;hamele&s;s intercour&s;e with pro&s;titutes, to which places they are virtually in|vited by public adverti&s;ement, as a lounge previous to their admi&s;&s;ion at half price, to the di&s;gu&s;t, an|noyance, and terror of mode&s;ty. For the&s;e and many, many, other cogent and &s;imilar rea&s;ons, I DROP THE CURTAIN AT THE DEATH OF GARRICK.</P>
