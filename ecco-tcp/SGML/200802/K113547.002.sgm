<P>The great fault of this piece, written by Dr. Parnell, is, that it is in eight &s;yllable lines, very improper for the &s;olemnity of the &s;ubject; otherwi&s;e, the poem is natural, and the reflections ju&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>A FAIRY TALE. BY DR. PARNELL.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Never was the old manner of &s;peaking more hap|pily applied, or a tale better told, than this.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>IN Britain's i&s;le, and Arthur's days,</L>
<L>When midnight Fairies daunc'd the maze,</L>
<L>Liv'd Edwin of the Green;</L>
<L>Edwin, I wis, a gentle youth,</L>

<L>And lift it&s;elf above;</L>
<L>Yet, &s;pite of all that Nature did</L>
<L>To make his uncouth form forbid,</L>
<L>This creature dar'd to love.</L>
<L>He felt the charms of Edith's eyes,</L>
<L>Nor wanted hope to gain the prize,</L>
<L>Cou'd ladies look within;</L>
<L>But one Sir Topaz dre&s;s'd with art,</L>
<L>And, if a &s;hape cou'd win a heart,</L>
<L>He had a &s;hape to win.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="9">Edwin, if right I read my &s;ong,</L>
<L>With &s;lighted pa&s;&s;ion pac'd along</L>
<L>All in the moony light;</L>
<L>'Twas near an old inchanted court,</L>
<L>Where &s;portive fairies made re&s;ort,</L>
<L>To revel out the night.</L>
<L>His heart was drear, his hope was cro&s;s'd,</L>

<L>And drops his limbs adown.</L>
<L>But &s;cant he lays him on the floor,</L>
<L>When hollow winds remove the door,</L>
<L>A trembling rocks the ground:</L>

<L>'Tis well, the gallant cries again,</L>
<L>We fairies never injure men</L>

<L>Here ended all the phantom play;</L>
<L>They &s;melt the fre&s;h approach of day,</L>
<L>And heard a cock to crow;</L>
<L>The whirling wind that bore the crowd,</L>
<L>Has clapp'd the door, and whi&s;tled loud,</L>
<L>To warn them all to go.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="12">Then, &s;creaming all at once, they fly,</L>

<L>Poor Edwin falls to floor;</L>
<L>Forlorn his &s;tate, and dark the place,</L>

<L>A &s;haking &s;eiz'd the wall:</L>

<HEAD>PALEMON AND LAVINIA.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Mr. Thom&s;on, though, in general, a verbo&s;e and affected poet, has told this &s;tory with unu&s;ual &s;im|plicity: it is rather given here for being much e&s;teemed by the public, than by the editor.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<L>THE lovely young Lavinia once had friends;</L>
<L>And Fortune &s;mil'd, deceitful, on her birth.</L>
<L>For, in her helple&s;s years, depriv'd of all,</L>
<L>Of every &s;tay, &s;ave Innocence and Heaven,</L>
<L>She, with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</L>
<L>And poor, liv'd in a cottage, far retir'd</L>
<L>Among the windings of a woody vale;</L>
<L>By &s;olitude and deep &s;urrounding &s;hades,</L>
<L>But more by ba&s;hful mode&s;ty, conceal'd.</L>
<L>Together thus they &s;hunn'd the cruel &s;corn</L>
<L>Which virtue, &s;unk to poverty, would meet</L>
<L>From giddy pa&s;&s;ion and low-minded pride:</L>
<L>Almo&s;t on Nature's common bounty fed;</L>
<L>Like the gay birds that &s;ung them to repo&s;e,</L>
<L>Content, and carele&s;s of tomorrow's fare.</L>
<L>Her form was fre&s;her than the morning ro&s;e,</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="16">When the dew wets its leaves: un&s;tain'd, and pure,</L>
<L>As is the lilly, or the mountain &s;now.</L>
<L>The mode&s;t virtues mingled in her eyes,</L>
<L>Still on the ground dejected, darting all</L>
<L>Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:</L>
<L>Or when the mournful tale her mother told,</L>
<L>Of what her faithle&s;s fortune promis'd once,</L>
<L>Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy &s;tar</L>
<L>Of evening, &s;hone in tears. A native grace</L>
<L>Sat, fair-proportion'd, on her poli&s;h'd limbs,</L>

<L>Beyond the pomp of dre&s;s; for loveline&s;s</L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</L>
<L>But is, when unadorn'd, adorn'd the mo&s;t.</L>
<L>Thoughtle&s;s of beauty, &s;he was beauty's &s;elf,</L>
<L>Reclu&s;e amid the clo&s;e-embowering woods.</L>
<L>As, in the hollow brea&s;t of Appenine,</L>

<L>With &s;miling patience in her looks, &s;he went</L>
<L>To glean Palemon's fields. The pride of &s;wains</L>
<L>Palemon was, the generous, and the rich;</L>
<L>Who led the rural life in all its joy</L>
<L>And elegance, &s;uch as Arcadian &s;ong</L>

<L>Uncon&s;cious of her power, and turning quick</L>
<L>With unaffected blu&s;hes from his gaze:</L>
<L>He &s;aw her charming, but he &s;aw not half</L>
<L>The charms her down-ca&s;t mode&s;ty conceal'd.</L>
<L>That very moment love and cha&s;te de&s;ire</L>

<L>All, but the nymph that &s;hould redre&s;s his wrong,</L>

<P>This work, by the duke of Buckingham, is en|rolled among our great Engli&s;h productions. The precepts are &s;en&s;ible, the poetry not indifferent, but it has been prai&s;ed more than it de&s;erves.</P>

<L>OF all tho&s;e arts in which the wi&s;e excel,</L>
<L>Nature's chief ma&s;ter-piece is writing well:</L>

<L>As &s;acred and &s;oul-moving poe&s;y:</L>

<L>But Heav'n forbid we &s;hould be &s;o profane,</L>

<L>'Tis not a fla&s;h of fancy, which, &s;ometimes,</L>
<L>Dazzling our minds, &s;ets off the &s;lighte&s;t rhimes;</L>
<L>Bright as a blaze, but in a moment done:</L>
<L>True wit is everla&s;ting, like the &s;un,</L>
<L>Which, tho' &s;ometimes behind a cloud retir'd,</L>
