<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WORKS of this kind are in general of &s;o captivat|ing a nature to young readers, that let them run through but a few pages of almo&s;t any Novel, and they will feel their affections or curio&s;ity &s;o intere&s;ted, either in the characters or the events, that it is with difficulty they can be di|verted to any other &s;tudy or
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
amu&s;ement, till they have got to the end of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>From the experience then of this &s;pecies of attraction, &s;uch &s;ort of writings may be rendered, by good and ingenious authors, ex|tremely &s;erviceable to morals, and other u&s;eful purpo&s;es of life&mdash;Place the magnet low, and it will de|grade our &s;entiments; hold it high, and it elevates them. Imitation is natural to the human mind; and as we copy tho&s;e patterns be&s;t, which we are mo&s;t conver&s;ant with, it depends upon the choice that
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
parents and preceptors make of &s;uch compo&s;itions, to produce the be&s;t effect from this general &s;ym|pathy.&mdash;<HI>Tell me your company,</HI> is a ju&s;t adage; but <HI>tell me your &s;tudies</HI> is as true a maxim.</P>
<P>In the &s;election of proper pieces to a&s;&s;i&s;t toward &s;o plea&s;ing a me|thod of in&s;truction, no incon&s;ide|rable part of the attention ought to be paid to the &s;tile and language of the writers; for it is certain that tho&s;e who can be&s;t expre&s;s their &s;entiments, are tho&s;e who conceive them be&s;t; and the &s;ame idea delivered by a gentleman,
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
will have double the effect to what it would have if uttered by his va|let de chambre.</P>
<P>All authors, therefore, of mean or illiberal education, or &s;tationed below the familiar conver&s;e of po|lite life, &s;hould be wholly exclud|ed from the &s;ort of library I am here recommending. Nor &s;hould any tran&s;lations be admitted there, though <HI>done from the originals by the be&s;t hands,</HI> according to the phra&s;e of their title pages&mdash;For there is a &s;tiffne&s;s in the &s;tile of all the publications of this kind I have
<PB N="ix" REF="7">
ever met with, that con&s;trains the ea&s;e and freedom of our language, and impures it with a number of Gallici&s;ms, Italiani&s;ms, &amp;c. which even tho&s;e who are allowed to be <HI>the be&s;t hands,</HI> that have ever con|de&s;cended to &s;o &s;ervile an office, find it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid. A work, framed from one's own ideas, is like learning to write from <HI>a copy,</HI> a tran&s;lation is like <HI>tracing</HI> the letters after the ma&s;ter has <HI>penciled</HI> them for us.</P>
<P>If I have had any &s;ucce&s;s in this, or my former work of the &s;ame
<PB N="x" REF="8">
kind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Delicate Di&s;tre&s;s.</NOTE>, it is owing more to accident than genius, and may therefore be deemed rather fortunate than me|ritorious. I have had a good deal of acquaintance with the world, and have known many private me|moirs, and particular circum&s;tan|ces in life, which has afforded me an opportunity of &s;upplying both my characters and &s;ituations from the living drama, in&s;tead of borrowing them from the mimic &s;cene. I felt, as I wrote, <HI>and lived along the line,</HI> from the &s;ym|pathy of friend&s;hip, or the tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="xi" REF="9">
of compa&s;&s;ion. This is conta|gious&mdash;I hope my readers may catch the infection al&s;o.</P>
<P>For I &s;hall think my&s;elf extreme|ly happy, if I can, in any degree, contribute towards forming, or in|forming, the young and innocent; the ta&s;k of reforming I leave to greater geniu&s;es, and abler pens. The characters which pre&s;ent them&s;elves in this work, are, as I have already hinted, mo&s;tly drawn from real life, they are therefore natural, and proper objects, either for imitation or avoidance,<PB N="xii" REF="10"><Q><L>" Virtuous, and vicious, every man mu&s;t be;</L>
<L>" Few in th' extreme, but all in the degree."</L></Q></P>
<P>But, when writers exceed the bounds of probability, and de&s;cribe an angel, or a devil, in human form, our rea&s;on is &s;hocked, and revolts at the idea of a character &s;o much above, or below, our nature; the &s;emblance of truth vani&s;hes, the reader's attention becomes re|laxed, and both the events, and the moral, if there &s;hould be any,<Q><L>" Fade like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion,</L>
<L>" Nor leave a wreck behind!"</L></Q></P>
<P>With &s;uch productions our cir|culating libraries, tho&s;e <HI>&s;lop-&s;hops</HI>
<PB N="xiii" REF="11">
in literature, abound, and with them mu&s;t they &s;till be filled, till our legi&s;lature &s;hall think proper to enable the book&s;ellers to pay for better works, by pa&s;&s;ing an act to &s;ecure their property, in the copies they purcha&s;e: till that is done, no per&s;on in the trade can afford to pay a large &s;um for any manu&s;cript, be the merit of it what it will; and of cour&s;e no au|thors, except the very poor ones, indeed, both in the literal and me|taphorical &s;en&s;e of the word, or the rich, who form but a &s;mall &s;quadron in the ho&s;t of writers,
<PB N="xiv" REF="12">
will devote their time and labour to the public, without hope of &s;ome adequate reward.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who among&s;t our legions, neither want, nor abound, have therefore but one way of contribut|ing their mite to the Parna&s;&s;ian trea&s;ury; that of publi&s;hing by &s;ub&s;cription, which in my e&s;tima|tion is at once both flattering, and humiliating, as it proves the at|tachment of our friends, while it lays us under the painful nece&s;&s;ity of taxing their regard.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="13">Happy and honoured as I have been by the favour of the public in general, as well as by the kind par|tiality of my particular friends, I &s;hall ever be both proud and plea&s;|ed to offer my pre&s;ent and future efforts to their indulgent candor, upon any terms, and to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf their</P>

<L>" Where e'er I go, whatever realms I &s;ee,</L>
<L>" My heart untravelled, fondly turns to thee.</L>
<L>" Still to my Fanny turns, with cea&s;ele&s;s pain,</L>
<L>" And drags at each remove, a lengthening chain."</L></Q>
<P>HOW much am I indebted to the author of the&s;e beautiful lines, for having expre&s;&s;ed my pre&s;ent feelings, &s;o much better than I could my&s;elf. The addre&s;s was originally made to a brother, there can therefore be no im|propriety
<PB N="2" REF="16">
in applying them to a &s;i&s;ter&mdash;and &s;uch a one as mine&mdash;</P>
<P>You de&s;ired me, my Fanny, to write to you from every &s;tage&mdash;this is the fir&s;t moment I have had to my&s;elf&mdash;one of Sir William's mo&s;t favourite maxims, is, that women &s;hould be treated like &s;tate criminals, and utterly debarred the u&s;e of pen and ink&mdash;he &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tho&s;e who are fond of &s;cribling, are never good for any thing el&s;e; that fe|male friend&s;hip is a je&s;t; and that we only corre&s;pond, or conver&s;e, with our own &s;ex, for the &s;ake of indulging our&s;elves in talking of the other."</Q></P>
<P>Why, Sir William, why will you di&s;|cover &s;uch illiberal &s;entiments, to one who has been &s;o lately prevailed upon to
<PB N="3" REF="17">
pronounce tho&s;e awful words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"love, honor, and obey"</Q>! The fulfilling the two fir&s;t articles of this &s;olemn engage|ment, mu&s;t depend upon your&s;elf, the latter only, re&s;ts on me; and I will mo&s;t &s;anctimoniou&s;ly perform my part of the covenant.</P>
<P>Yes, my &s;i&s;ter, I will &s;tifle the ri&s;ing &s;igh, and wipe away the wayward tear, that &s;teals involuntarily down my cheek, from the fond recollection of tho&s;e dear friends, that I have left behind me. Would to nature that the objects nece&s;|&s;arily followed their affections, or el&s;e retained them with them&s;elves, in&s;tead of &s;uffering remembrance, like a tyrant, to pur&s;ue the unhappy traveller, ad|ding anxiety to fatigue, and grief to danger.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="18">Sir William has met with &s;ome gen|tlemen of his acquaintance, here; he pre|&s;ented them to me, and I could &s;ee that he &s;eemed plea&s;ed at that &s;ort of appro|bation which is expre&s;&s;ed by looks, at fir&s;t &s;ight of a per&s;on who happens to plea&s;e us&mdash;there would be &s;omething flattering in this idea which I &s;hould wi&s;h to cheri&s;h, if I did not fear that his plea&s;ure aro&s;e more from vanity, than affection.&mdash;Yet why &s;hould I think &s;o? Has he not pur&s;ued me with unabated ardour, near two years, and triumphed over the repeated refu&s;als of my friends, and &s;elf, by the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate per&s;eve|rance? But might not vanity&mdash;be &s;till, thou re&s;tle&s;s, bu&s;y, perturbed &s;pirit! and no longer &s;eek to inve&s;tigate an humiliat|ing cau&s;e for an event which is irrevo|cably pa&s;t!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="19">The&s;e gentlemen, then, that I told you of, are to join company with us, for the remainder of our journey and voy|age:&mdash;there is one of them a Lord &s;ome|thing, I forgot his title, who is ju&s;t re|turned from making the <HI>grande tour</HI>; his per&s;on is elegant; I think him, both in face, and figure, va&s;tly like Colonel Stanford.&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e this young noble|man will be the <HI>bon ton</HI> of this winter, in Dublin; it may therefore be of &s;ome u&s;e to a &s;tranger, as I &s;hall be, to be known to him. I &s;hall not, however, cultivate the pre&s;ent opportunity, as I have left the room, determined not to return, on pre|tence of a head-ach, in order to tell my dear Fanny what &s;he already knows, that I am her more than &s;i&s;ter, her affec|tionate and faithful friend,</P>

<P>WILL you not doubt my veracity, Fanny, when I tell you, that three days &s;pent in this dulle&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable of villages, have not ap|peared tedious to me! There is certainly a wonderful charm in variety of &s;itua|tions&mdash;every change produces a new a&s;|&s;emblage of ideas; and actuates the mind with curio&s;ity, compari&s;on, and inquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="21">The wildne&s;s, or even horror, of this place, for we have had a perpetual &s;torm, is &s;o &s;trongly contra&s;ted with the mild &s;cenes of Cleveland Hall, or indeed any other part of England that I have &s;een, that one would &s;carce think it po&s;&s;ible for a few days journey to tran&s;port us into &s;uch extremes, of the &s;ublime and beautiful&mdash;</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that all the inhabitants of Wales mu&s;t be romantic:&mdash;there ne|ver was any place appeared &s;o like en|chanted ground, and the &s;cenes &s;hift up|on you almo&s;t as quick as in a panto|mime&mdash;from the &s;tupendous, bleak, and barren hills of Cambria, you are al|mo&s;t in&s;tantly tran&s;ported into fertile and laughing vallies.&mdash;There never was a richer, and more beautiful view, than
<PB N="8" REF="22">
that of the Vale of Cluyd.&mdash;I am not at at all &s;urpri&s;ed that poetry took its ri&s;e in this part of Britain; the ancient Dru|ids could not be at a lo&s;s for poetic ima|ges&mdash;every object they &s;aw mu&s;t have in&s;pired them, and exceeded, both in beauty, and wildne&s;s, whatever &s;portive fancy could have invented, or creative genius drawn forth from the &s;tore-hou&s;e of imagination.</P>
<P>I think that even I &s;eem to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a kind of poetic rapture, while I de&s;cribe the&s;e charming &s;cenes; but I will not anticipate the plea&s;ure that I hope you will your&s;elf receive from them, next &s;ummer; tho' I already fore&s;tall the much higher delight I &s;hall feel, on &s;eeing my dear Fanny at South-field.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="23">Sir William has been in great &s;pirits ever &s;ince we have been here; and highly plea&s;ed at a very trifling mark of my <HI>obedience:</HI>&mdash;he propo&s;ed riding out, the morning after we came; and though there was a high wind, and a drizzling rain, I made not the lea&s;t objection to mounting one of the little Wel&s;h pal|freys, and clambering up the hills, at his reque&s;t&mdash;our fellow travellers, Lord Lucan and Colonel Walter, accompa|nied us.</P>
<P>I have de&s;cribed the former to you&mdash;the latter is remarkably hand&s;ome, but with a peculiar expre&s;&s;ion in his coun|tenance, which is not the re&s;ult of his features, but &s;eems to ari&s;e from the predominancy of a particular pa&s;&s;ion in his mind&mdash;in &s;hort it is that &s;ort of ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="10" REF="24">
which has made you and me di&s;like &s;o many hand&s;ome men.</P>
<P>The Colonel is to be our neighbour in the country; he is now going to Ire|land, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, and a &s;eat in parliament for a borough he never &s;aw&mdash;I am no politician, or I &s;hould animadvert a little upon this &s;ub|ject. This &s;elf-&s;ame Colonel has ju&s;t tapped at my door, to tell me that the wind veers a little, and that Sir William de&s;ires I will hold my&s;elf in readine&s;s to embark.

three times, by his pathetic manner of lamenting his not knowing me then. I tell him that he may date his acquaint|ance from what aera he plea&s;es, as our living together in an inn has brought on a greater intimacy, in four days, than almo&s;t as many years could have effected, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of meeting at Operas, Routes, &amp;c.

<P>WHAT &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s have I gone thro', &s;ince I concluded my la&s;t letter to my dear Fanny! We em|barked aboard the pacquet-boat, with what they called a &s;hifting gale, and to do the captain ju&s;tice, he was unwilling to &s;ail. But Sir William and Colonel Walter were both impatient; and their impetuo&s;ity, as it generally does, triumph|ed over our calmer rea&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>We had not been three hours at &s;ea, before there aro&s;e &s;o violent a &s;torm, that the captain &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;hip to weather it, &s;ix hours: he was, however, mi&s;taken, for it continued &s;ix
<PB N="13" REF="27">
and thirty&mdash;during which time we had been driven upon the northern coa&s;t of Ireland, and it was then to be feared that we &s;hould beat to pieces, on the rocks. There was a great number of pa&s;|&s;engers on board, and their groans and lamentations would have affected me extremely, in any other &s;ituation; but the violent and continued &s;ickne&s;s which I &s;uffered, rendered me in&s;en&s;ible, even to my own danger; nor did I feel the &s;malle&s;t emotion when Lord Lucan, who had &s;eldom left my bed&s;ide, caught hold of my hand, with a degree of wildne&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We mu&s;t peri&s;h!&mdash;but we &s;hall die, together!"</Q></P>
<P>The Captain had fired guns of di&s;tre&s;s upon our approaching the &s;hore; and a fi&s;hing boat came to our relief, into
<PB N="14" REF="28">
which the pa&s;&s;engers crouded &s;o fa&s;t, that the gentlemen were obliged to draw their &s;words, to prevent their &s;inking it. How I got into the boat I know not, but I found my&s;elf there, rolled up in Lord Lucan's rocquelaure, and my head &s;upported by Sir William's knee&mdash;there were two other ladies in the boat with us, the younge&s;t of whom, a Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter, &s;eemed to be, if po&s;&s;ible, wor&s;e than I&mdash;but I will not detain you longer in this &s;cene of horror, where we expect|ed to be &s;wallowed up by the waves, that came rolling on us, like moving mountains, every moment, till we reached the &s;hore.&mdash;</P>
<P>Behold us then landed upon what may almo&s;t be called a de&s;ert i&s;land, for it is entirely &s;urrounded by an arm
<PB N="15" REF="29">
of the &s;ea, and uninhabited by every thing but a few goats, and &s;ome fi&s;her|men, who are almo&s;t as wild as they.&mdash;It was about four o' clock in the morn|ing, when we arrived at this di&s;mal place, and &s;uch a morning, for darkne&s;s, rain, and wind, I never &s;aw!</P>
<P>Neither Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter nor I could &s;tand, much le&s;s walk, and the gentle|men were obliged to carry us in their arms, by turns, for near two miles&mdash;till we arrived at &s;ome of the huts, where the ho&s;pitable cottagers received us with that &s;ort of &s;urprize, which I imagine we &s;hould feel, if an order of higher beings were to de&s;cend by miracle to vi&s;it us.&mdash;But be their kindne&s;s never forgot by me! and may their beds of &s;traw, and &s;moaky rafters, yield them
<PB N="16" REF="30">
&s;uch &s;oft and balmy &s;leep, as they af|forded to my harra&s;&s;ed frame! and let them never envy tho&s;e that to&s;s on down.</P>
<P>I did not wake till near ten in the morning, which was then as mild as it had been tempe&s;tuous when I re|tired to re&s;t. Lord Lucan and Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter were &s;eated on a little bank, without-&s;ide the door of the cottage where I &s;lept, to prevent any per&s;on from di&s;turbing me; as &s;oon as they heard me move, Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter came to offer her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in dre&s;&s;ing me&mdash;&s;he &s;miling &s;aid that breakfa&s;t was prepared for me, in a large drawing-room, and under the fine&s;t canopy &s;he had ever &s;een; then led me by the hand to the bank where &s;he had been &s;itting&mdash;I was &s;urprized to &s;ee tea there, which, tho' made in wooden
<PB N="17" REF="31">
ve&s;&s;els, appeared to me more delicious, than any that I had ever drank out of the fine&s;t Dre&s;den china.&mdash;</P>
<P>Lord Lucan told me, that Sir Wil|liam, the re&s;t of the gentlemen, and Mrs. Layton, who is Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter's aunt, were gone to <HI>reconnoitre la carte du pa&iuml;, de la terre inconnu&euml;, ou nons etions</HI>&mdash;and that now he had &s;een me &s;o happily re|covered, he wou'd try to join them.&mdash;</P>
<P>I found that another boat had arrived from the &s;hip, and that our &s;ervants, and a part of our baggage were come&mdash;when my poor Ben&s;on &s;aw me, &s;he cried for joy; and indeed nothing but the &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, in which I quitted the ve&s;&s;el, could have made me leave her behind.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="32">Upon enquiring, we were told that there were neither hor&s;es or carriages, of any kind, to be had, to convey us out of the i&s;land, but that we might cro&s;s, in a boat, to a piece of land that lay oppo&s;ite to one &s;ide of it, which, when we reached, was eight miles from any town, or village. As &s;oon as I had chan|ged my cloaths, Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter and I &s;et out to meet, or overtake, our company; to confer about the difficulties of our &s;ad &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I will bring you acquainted with Mi&s;s Lei&s;ler, in my next letter; and for the pre&s;ent I will call her Lucy, for I am &s;ure I &s;hall love her, and in that ca&s;e I hate the formality of Mi&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e us now to have walked about a mile and a half, without di&s;covering
<PB N="19" REF="33">
any object but the &s;ea, which &s;urrounded us, when, to our great delight, we &s;pied land, tho' &s;till divided from us by a gulph we thought impa&s;&s;able. We &s;tood however on the &s;hore, inventing a thou|&s;and impracticable &s;chemes to cro&s;s this tremendous Helle&s;pont, but never once thought of the only po&s;&s;ible one, tho' we had been told of it. We at la&s;t grew weary of indulging our vi&s;ions, and Lu|cy, who I find is extremely romantic, &s;aid, that, were &s;he in my &s;ituation, &s;he could, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure, think of pa&s;&s;ing her days on the &s;pot we were thrown on; for that the con&s;tant pre&s;ence of <HI>the</HI> beloved object, mu&s;t ren|der any place an Eden to her.&mdash;I told her, that if we were fated to remain there, that either Lord Lucan, or Colonel Walter, would, I hoped, make this &s;pot
<PB N="20" REF="34">
a paradi&s;e to her, on her own plan. She wiped away a &s;tarting tear, and &s;aid that was impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant a new object rou&s;ed our attention; we perceived a gentleman, well mounted, and attended by a couple of &s;ervants, on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; Lucy put up a mo&s;t fervent ejaculation, that he might have knight-errantry enough to cro&s;s the river, and re&s;cue us from our melancholy &s;ituation: her prayer was heard&mdash;he &s;wam his hor&s;e acro&s;s the flood, and Lucy called him a &s;econd Leander! He came up to us with infi|nite politene&s;s and addre&s;s, and told us, that the mail which had been put on &s;hore with us, had been forwarded to his father, who was the next ju&s;tice of peace, and lived about twelve miles from
<PB N="21" REF="35">
thence; that by that means he became acquainted with our di&s;tre&s;s, and had &s;ent his carriage, as far as the roads were pa&s;&s;able, with a number of &s;addle hor&s;es, to bring us to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was charmed with this in|&s;tance of ho&s;pitality, and genero&s;ity; I hope I &s;hould have been as much plea&s;ed with it, had I only heard it related, with|out having benefited by it.&mdash;There is nothing affects my heart &s;o much as bene|volent actions; I will flatter my&s;elf, that this is owing to a natural &s;ympathy.&mdash;We made all the acknowledgments that our joy would permit; and walked, or rather ran, back to our cottage with the &s;tran|ger; where we met our company, and many more of the pa&s;&s;engers, who had come in the &s;econd boat from the &s;hip.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="36">Mr. Mathewes's &s;ervants were by this time come up to us, and opened two large ba&s;kets of provi&s;ions, cold meats, wine, tea, &amp;c.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the pre&s;ent, I will continue my letters journal-wi&s;e, as Mi&s;s Byron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</NOTE> calls it; but I cannot for my life be cir|cum&s;tantial, and carry you up and down &s;tairs, to the parlour, the drawing-room, the harp&s;icord, the card-table, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="38">Suppo&s;e us then to have cro&s;&s;ed the &s;o much dreaded arm of the &s;ea, with &s;ome difficulty, and le&s;s danger; that we have performed our twelve miles journey, thro' rugged roads, and over hills and dales; and are at la&s;t &s;afely arrived at Mr. Mathewes's very hand&s;ome &s;eat, wel|comed by him and his lady, and a very numerous family of &s;ons and daughters, grown up to men and women's e&s;tate.</P>
<P>On our entrance we were &s;hewn into a room, where there was a table laid with all kinds of breakfa&s;ts, that could be plea&s;ing or nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ick, or healthful appetite, and were informed that there were beds prepared for any of the company, who might require re&s;t after their fatigue. This offer was de|clined by us all, for the pre&s;ent; but the
<PB N="25" REF="39">
whole company, which amounted to eigh|teen ladies and gentlemen, be&s;ides &s;er|vants, accepted Mr. Mathewes's invi|tation, to &s;pend that day and night at his hou&s;e, except Colonel Walter, who &s;aid he would go on to Newry, the next great town, and &s;end us carriages from thence.&mdash;</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t notion that you could conceive of our generous ho&s;ts, you mu&s;t believe that we were politely and ele|gantly entertained; but neither your idea, nor my de&s;cription can do ju&s;tice to their ho&s;pitality; they have given me the mo&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ions of this country, on my fir&s;t entering it; but even Sir William, who is partial to his native land, &s;ays I am not to expect a whole nation, of &s;uch&mdash;fools! I think he &s;aid
<PB N="26" REF="40">
&mdash;heigh, ho! this is my only com|ment.&mdash;</P>
<P>The manners and behaviour of this worthy and amiable family, were ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure at hav|ing had it in their power to relieve our di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;may they or their's never know any! Lucy was in raptures with the young ladies; both &s;he and I flatter our&s;elves with a pro&s;pect of much plea|&s;ure, from a future intimacy with Mrs. Mathewes and her daughters.</P>
<P>Next morning, our carriages, a coach and four, and &s;everal po&s;t-chai&s;es, arrived; and we took a grateful and affectionate leave of our kind ho&s;ts. Our journey had nothing remarkable in it, except Colonel Walter's waiting for us, at the
<PB N="27" REF="41">
fir&s;t &s;tage we came to, which, con&s;ider|ing the hurry he affected, when he left us, was rather an over&s;trained piece of politene&s;s, ari&s;ing I imagine from a &s;up|po&s;ition that his company was of &s;ome con&s;equence to the party.</P>
<P>And perhaps he is not mi&s;taken&mdash;Lucy's aunt, Mrs. Layton, a good, agree|able, and well jointured relict, about &s;ix and thirty, &s;eems to admire him much&mdash;&s;he &s;peaks Italian badly&mdash;he is ma&s;ter of the language, and &s;he is for ever applying to him, to correct her pronounciation&mdash;who knows but he may find plea&s;ure in in&s;tructing &s;o hopeful a pupil.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Colonel is what is called a wo|man's man: he has lived a good deal
<PB N="28" REF="42">
abroad, and has a &s;uperficial knowledge of almo&s;t every &s;cience&mdash;his head may be aptly enough compared to the draw|er of a lady's writing cable, which con|tains a little of every thing&mdash;I have this moment looked into mine, to &s;ee if the allu&s;ion is ju&s;t. Its contents are a mini|ature picture of Sir William, with a &s;light crack in the enamel, and the catch that fa&s;tens the bracelet broken&mdash;my hou&s;e-keeper's accounts&mdash;a little billet from Lucy&mdash;a French &s;ong, that the Colonel gave me&mdash;&s;ome &s;cented &s;ealing wax&mdash;writing paper&mdash;me&s;&s;age cards&mdash;and a pocket book, with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, pen|knife, pencil, blank leaves, &amp;c.&mdash;I do really think that this farrago of materials, conveys a very expre&s;&s;ive image of what I would de&s;cribe&mdash;I hope you will think &s;o too, and henceforward acknowlege the Colonel as an acquaintance.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="43">I promi&s;ed, in my la&s;t, to give you a &s;ketch of my Lucy, but I find I am not equal to the ta&s;k; for even in her outward appearance there is a variabi|lity, that renders it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to draw an exact re&s;emblance of her; at &s;ome times, you would think that her form and face were de&s;igned to per&s;onify Vivacity.&mdash;<Q><L>" Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air."</L></Q></P>
<P>At other times, a &s;oft melancholy u&s;urps the place of gaiety; &s;o that, at different aeras, &s;he may pa&s;s alternately for a <HI>Melpomene,</HI> or a <HI>Thalia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Mu&s;es of Tragedy and Comedy.</NOTE>; yet &s;he is agreeable, under both the&s;e characters, and I by no means think her temper changeable; but am rather inclined, tho' &s;orry to believe, that the&s;e tran&s;itions are
<PB N="30" REF="44">
rather the effect of peculiar circum&s;tances, than natural con&s;titution&mdash;</P>
<P>I know &s;he is in love&mdash;but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that to be rather a con&s;i&s;tent pa&s;&s;ion, where the flame is mutual; and I &s;hould be tempted almo&s;t to de&s;pi&s;e her, or any other woman in the world, who continued &s;till to love, without &s;ympathy&mdash;for true love is a pa&s;&s;ion of that extraordinary nature, as &s;ome author has well expre&s;&s;ed it, <HI>that it requires the felicity of two per&s;ons, to render one happy</HI>&mdash;Without being po&s;itively hand&s;ome, the men all like her, &s;he has good eyes, hair and teeth; a lively, tho' not a fine com|plexion; and a form that may ju&s;tly be &s;tiled elegant, tho' &s;mall.&mdash;</P>
<P>And now, my dear Fanny, let me &s;peak of, and to, your&s;elf. It is above
<PB N="31" REF="45">
a month &s;ince I left London; I have been a fortnight in Dublin, and have not received a &s;ingle line from you, or any of the other dear friends I parted from in Dover-&s;treet!&mdash;They tell me &s;omething about contrary winds&mdash;for my own peace, I will believe them, but if I am to remain in this i&s;land, much longer, under &s;uch &s;u&s;pence, I &s;hall be tempted to &s;ell my jewels, and &s;end the money to Lapland, to purcha&s;e, I know not whether it is to be an ea&s;terly, or a we&s;terly wind&mdash;but it &s;hall be a fair gale to waft your letters to me&mdash;for the &s;tory of Aeolus and Uly&s;&s;es, you know, is quite an arrant fiction.</P>

<P>I Received my dear &s;i&s;ter's two letters, from Wales, together; and am plea&s;ed to find that you illu&s;trate your own remark on the good effects which change of objects produce upon our minds. I have always thought, that in the &s;epara|tion of two per&s;ons, who love each other, the one who is left, is by far the greate&s;t &s;ufferer. The mind, in &s;pite of us, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in &s;ome degree, accompany, or rather attend upon, the body; and while that is in motion, it feels a kind of rotation al&s;o&mdash;
<Q><L>" Beaux, bani&s;h beaux; and coaches, coaches drive."</L></Q>
And now I talk of coaches, I have never

&s;et my foot in ours, &s;ince you left Lon|don: I begin to think that this is carry|ing the idea of locality too far, and will therefore order it to &s;et me down at the play-hou&s;e, this evening.</P>
<P>Your de&s;cription of South-Britain has encrea&s;ed my curio&s;ity, but not my de&s;ire of travelling through it&mdash;for what can augment my wi&s;hes to &s;ee you! Your fir&s;t letter affected me, extremely&mdash;Oh! beware of a propen&s;ity to unhappine&s;s, my much loved &s;i&s;ter! Sir William has a roughne&s;s in his manner, which I really believe to be more owing to an illiberal education than a coar&s;e mind&mdash;I &s;ay <HI>illiberal,</HI> tho' I know he was bred at a college&mdash;learning and &s;cience may be there acquired, but alas! I fear the profe&s;&s;ors of univer&s;ities do not attend
<PB N="34" REF="48">
much to <HI>les petites morales</HI>&mdash;There are many men weak enough to imagine that an affectation of contempt for the under|&s;tandings of women, is proof &s;ufficient of the &s;uperiority of their own&mdash;but the&s;e per&s;ons ought never to marry; for we can neither love tho&s;e we de&s;pi&s;e, nor tho&s;e who &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e us&mdash;But I am far from imagining this to be Sir Wil|liam's ca&s;e; I know he both loves and e&s;teems my Loui&s;a, though he be defi|cient in that &s;ort of galant addre&s;s, which might better inable him to &s;hew his &s;en|timents&mdash;But how few hu&s;bands are there, after all, even in what is &s;tiled polite life, who &s;eem to think &s;uch an attention nece&s;&s;ary? I affirm it to be ab&s;olutely &s;o&mdash;for they mu&s;t be &s;ad philo&s;ophers, indeed, who mi&s;take the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of a trea&s;ure for the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of it: but I will not
<PB N="35" REF="49">
forgive your trifling with your own hap|pine&s;s, by &s;eeming to doubt a fact, on which alone it can be founded.</P>
<P>I am glad you have happened to meet with the gentlemen you mention&mdash;Agreeable &s;ociety is always plea&s;ing to a rational mind, but more particularly &s;o when there is any little difficulty, danger or fatigue, to encounter; and notwith|ing your flouri&s;hing de&s;cription of Wales, I cannot help thinking that a journey thro' it mu&s;t be attended, in &s;ome de|gree, with tho&s;e &s;light evils I have mentioned.&mdash;</P>
<P>My brother has been remarkably grave, ever &s;ince you left us; but I will not flatter you, by imputing his re&s;erve intirely to your ab&s;ence&mdash;his Delia! his beloved Mi&s;s Colville! is going to France,

<P>I have told him, and I really believe it, that Mrs. Colville has no exception, either to his per&s;on, rank, or fortune, tho' &s;he will never con&s;ent to his marry|ing her daughter; but I am per&s;uaded that &s;he would mo&s;t readily accept of him her&s;elf.&mdash;Sir George cannot help &s;miling, when I talk in this &s;train, tho' he affects to be di&s;plea&s;ed, at what he calls my folly.</P>

<P>All girls build ca&s;tles; mine have been always &s;ituated on a &s;ea-coa&s;t, and in them have I often received &s;hipwrecked prin|ce&s;&s;es, and drowning heroes; I have chafed their temples, and rubbed their hands, for whole hours; and when my great care and humanity have brought
<PB N="41" REF="55">
them back to this world of woes, they have repaid my pains by a faithful recital of their doleful adventures.&mdash;I once fell in love with a man I never &s;aw, for the &s;ame &s;entiment.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Triumvirate, chap. xciii.</NOTE>&mdash;I did not then imagine I &s;hould ever have &s;o near and dear a connection as my Loui&s;a, involved in the reality of &s;uch a dreadful &s;itua|tion; and now may heaven be prai&s;ed for my loved &s;i&s;ter's pre&s;ervation!</P>

<P>INdeed, my dear Fanny, your la&s;t let|ter has hurt me &s;en&s;ibly&mdash;I cannot expre&s;s the tender concern I feel for your &s;ufferings&mdash;yet with that frankne&s;s we both &s;o much admire, I will confe&s;s that I am, on this occa&s;ion, con&s;cious of the force of Rochfaucault's &s;elfi&s;h maxim, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our be&s;t friends, we find &s;omething that does not di&s;plea&s;e us."</Q> Horrid adage! yet how true! when I cannot help re|joicing that I have never felt the pa&s;&s;ion of Love, in the extreme that you &s;eem to do&mdash;I have ever thought that love, like friend&s;hip, could only be founded on
<PB N="48" REF="62">
the amiable qualities of its object, and that with them it mu&s;t, becau&s;e it ought, decay.&mdash;How often have you and I laughed at the per&s;evering pa&s;&s;ion of Mi&s;s B&mdash;, when we knew that Lord M&mdash; de&s;pi&s;ed her?&mdash;But the little tyrant has taken ample vengeance upon you&mdash;Heaven &s;hield me from his re&s;entment!</P>
<P>I am, however, far from doubting Lord Hume's con&s;tancy or love to my &s;weet Fanny; and my opinion is found|ed on your charms, rather than his me|rits&mdash;yet grant him to be all you can wi&s;h, &s;urely it is a mi&s;erable &s;tate to have our happine&s;s &s;o totally dependent upon any human being, that our not hearing from them, for a few days or weeks, &s;hall render us totally wretched, and create &s;uch a fever in the mind, as you

de&s;cribe, and I tremble at! Heavens! what a wretch &s;hould I be, were I po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of this tormenting pa&s;&s;ion. I am certain Sir William has no more idea of it than of a &s;ixth &s;en&s;e&mdash;how would the roughne&s;s and a&s;perity of his manners which are now &s;carce &s;ufferable, then wound me to the heart!</P>
<P>Rejoice with me, my Fanny&mdash;at what? not at my want of &s;en&s;ibility, for &s;ure I think not even you have more&mdash;and can I be delighted, then, at not hav|ing found in Sir William an object to awaken it! O, no! I fear I ought rather to lament than exult, in my pre&s;ent torpid &s;tate&mdash;but &s;till I have a &s;ubject for my tenderne&s;s, my much loved, dear|e&s;t &s;i&s;ter!

<P>I was alarmed at the fir&s;t part of your la&s;t letter; your treating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es I went thro', ludicrou&s;ly, was not like my Fanny; and when we &s;tray &s;o far out of our&s;elves, there mu&s;t be &s;ome particular cau&s;e, which we would wi&s;h to conceal, that occa&s;ions our acting or &s;peaking out of character&mdash;you were unhappy, and did not wi&s;h that I &s;hould know it? But let not even that &s;ort of pious fraud be ever practi&s;ed between us, more.&mdash;You may write freely, your letters are &s;acred; no eye but my own will ever &s;ee them. Sir William is &s;atisfied with our corre&s;|pondence; and &s;ays, he is &s;ure we &s;hall both be tired of it, in three months&mdash;I will venture to &s;ay he is mi&s;taken in us both.&mdash;</P>

<P>MY dear Loui&s;a's agreeable <HI>melange</HI> gave me infinite plea&s;ure, as I am very certain it is an exact repre|&s;entation of her &s;oft yet lively mind.&mdash;I am &s;orry the gloomy picture I &s;ent of my own, affected you even tran&s;i|ently.&mdash;Lovers, my dear, are a &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tent race of mortals; their pains and plea&s;ures &s;o totally dependant upon trifling accidents, and yet &s;o exqui&s;ite, that they are &s;carcely to be con&s;idered as rational beings.&mdash;You, who are not of the &s;ighing tribe, will be amazed when I tell you, that at the time I received the effu&s;ions of your &s;ympathetic tender|ne&s;s, I had almo&s;t forgotten the &s;ource
<PB N="58" REF="72">
of my own di&s;tre&s;s, and could have cried out, with Ore&s;tes, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I never was un|happy."&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>After this, I think I need not tell you that I had ju&s;t then received a let|ter from Lord Hume. He is well, and kind, my &s;i&s;ter! but, alas! he talks of &s;pending three years on his tour.&mdash;We are both young, 'tis certain; but three years are three centuries, in a lover's calendar&mdash;and &s;hould he hold his pur|po&s;e I &s;hould fancy my&s;elf old as a Sybil, or as Cybele, before that time may elap&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>Tho' I dete&s;t the maxim you have quoted from Rochfoucault, I do not blame you for rejoicing in your own ea&s;e and tranquility; but you &s;urely might
<PB N="59" REF="73">
do &s;o, though I were not in love&mdash;and yet, perhaps, the idea of your own felicity would not have &s;truck you &s;o &s;trongly, if you had not then thought me mi&s;erable!

<P>You &s;ee I am becoming a philo&s;opher again&mdash;but alas, Loui&s;a! my philo&s;ophy is literally the &s;port of chance; for I con|fe&s;s that the only happine&s;s I am at pre&s;ent

<P>I very &s;incerely join with you in wi&s;h|ing, &s;ince you have not yet, that you may never feel the pa&s;&s;ion of love, in an extreme degree; for I am firmly per|&s;uaded, that it does not contribute much to the happine&s;s of the female world&mdash;and yet, Loui&s;a, I will frankly tell you, that I am extremely grieved at &s;ome hints you have dropped, in your letters, which &s;peak a want of affection for Sir William.&mdash;It is dangerous to &s;port with &s;uch &s;entiments; you &s;hould not &s;uffer them to dwell even upon your own mind, much le&s;s expre&s;s them to others&mdash;we ought not be too &s;trict in analyzing the characters of tho&s;e we wi&s;h to love&mdash;
<PB N="61" REF="75">
if we once come to habituate our&s;elves to thinking of their faults, it in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ens the per&s;on in our e&s;teem, and &s;aps the foundation of our happine&s;s, with our love.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am perfectly convinced that you have fallen into this error, from want of reflec|tion, and through what is called <HI>une mani|ere de parler</HI>; for I will not &s;uppo&s;e that my Loui&s;a, tho' per&s;uaded by her friends and &s;olicited mo&s;t earne&s;tly by Sir Wil|liam, gave him her hand without feel|ing in her heart that preference for his per&s;on, and e&s;teem for his character, which is the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is for a permanent and tender affection.&mdash;</P>
<P>I almo&s;t condemn my&s;elf for the &s;e|verity of this &s;tricture; but my Loui&s;a's
<PB N="62" REF="76">
happine&s;s, is of too much con&s;equence to mine, to pa&s;s over an error that may de&s;troy it, unnoticed, before &s;he is aware.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>INDEED, my Fanny, I rejoice in your happine&s;s, tho' I cannot help feeling that I am a &s;ufferer by it; for if you had not received a very kind letter from Lord Hume, you would not, in all probability, have had &s;pirits &s;ufficient to have written an unkind one to me.&mdash;You are, my dear &s;i&s;ter, perfectly ac|quainted
<PB N="64" REF="78">
with every &s;entiment of my heart, therefore to repeat what you al|ready know, is needle&s;s. But in my own ju&s;tification I mu&s;t hold up a por|trait to your view, which, from a very &s;hort ab&s;ence, you &s;eem to have for|gotten.</P>
<P>By the lo&s;s of the be&s;t of parents, I be|came my own mi&s;tre&s;s, before I was &s;e|venteen&mdash;my brother, who is three years elder than I, was then returned from the univer&s;ity, and &s;et out almo&s;t immedi|ately on his travels. I then looked up to him as the &s;ole &s;tay, both of your youth and mine; and tho' my father's indul|gence had rendered us all independent of each other, I firmly re&s;olved never to marry, without the con&s;ent and appro|bation of Sir George.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="79">Young as you were you may remem|ber that during the time we pa&s;&s;ed at my aunt Marriot's, in Wilt&s;hire, there were &s;everal propo&s;als of marriage made to me; and among the re&s;t Sir William offered me his hand; but as my heart was by no means engaged by any of the per&s;ons who honoured me with their addre&s;&s;es, I adhered to my fir&s;t plan, and referred them all to my brother's de|ci&s;ion&mdash;as there had been no time fixed for Sir George's return, mo&s;t of tho&s;e who called them&s;elves my lovers, with|drew&mdash;but Sir William, either more en|amoured, or more artful, than the re&s;t, &s;et out immediately for Naples, where my brother then was, and by concili|ating his e&s;teem, obtained his con&s;ent, which he pretended was all that was wanting to complete his happine&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="80">When my brother wrote to us to meet him at Paris, I was tran&s;ported at the thoughts of &s;eeing him, after a two years ab&s;ence, but did not once reflect upon his motive for &s;ending for us, nor did I even know that Sir William Barton was to be one of the party.&mdash;Sir William's galantry in coming from Paris to meet us at Dover, flattered my vanity, I will c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nfe&s;s; the continuance of his a&s;&s;iduities, during our &s;tay in France, confirmed my brother's opinion of his pa&s;&s;ion for me.&mdash;But alas! I was &s;till in|capable of making any other return to his attentions, than what mere politene&s;s exacted from me.</P>
<P>How often have my brother, Sir Wil|liam, and you, &s;eemed to doubt my &s;in|cerity, when I have declared I knew not
<PB N="67" REF="81">
what love was! and, O! how fatal has that inexperience been to my peace, &s;ince! Yes, Fanny, your &s;i&s;ter is a wretch! and gave away her hand, before &s;he knew &s;he had a heart to transfer.&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet this I am convinced of, that had Sir William per&s;evered, perhaps a few months longer, in wi&s;hing &s;till to obtain that heart, it might, I doubt not, have been all his own. But can it now be&s;tow it&s;elf un&s;ought, and trembling yield to har&s;hne&s;s, and unkindne&s;s? Impo&s;&s;ible! The little rebel owns as yet no lord, and it may breck, but it will never bow, beneath a tyrant's frown!</P>
<P>There never was any per&s;on's beha|viour &s;o altered as Sir William's.&mdash;I per|ceived a vi&s;ible change in his manners,
<PB N="68" REF="82">
before we left London; but it has gone on in a ble&s;&s;ed gradation, ever &s;ince, and is at length arrived at the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of matrimonial di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;I &s;hall tell you a &s;hort &s;tory by way of in&s;tancing the uncouthne&s;s of my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, with regard to him.&mdash;Sir William is na|turally humane, at lea&s;t he u&s;ed to &s;eem &s;o&mdash;I was applied to by a wretched family, tenants of his own, who had lo&s;t their intire &s;ub&s;tance by fire&mdash;I immedi|ately took ten guineas out of my pur&s;e, to pay my charity, when he, with the mo&s;t &s;upercilious air imaginable, took hold of my hand, bid me put up my money, and not meddle with matters that I did not under&s;tand&mdash;&s;aid I was rather too young for a Lady Bountiful yet; and that if I went on at that rate, they would fire every cottage on his lands, and he
<PB N="69" REF="83">
&s;hould be run into a goal by my gene|ro&s;ity. I &s;tood amazed at this harangue&mdash;however I obeyed my hu&s;band, by put|ting up the money, but made Ben&s;on convey it to the poor &s;ufferers, as from a third per&s;on; while they with tran&s;|ports of gratitude, acknowleged their having received twenty pounds from Sir William, tho' forbidden to reveal his bounty to his &s;teward, or any of his fam|ily, on pain of his di&s;plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>Now, pr'ythee tell me, Fanny, if you do not con&s;ider this as an in&s;tance of a peculiar &s;ort of perver&s;ene&s;s? Why &s;hould he wi&s;h to re&s;train me from the vir|tuous plea&s;ure of be&s;towing charity? or endeavour to per&s;uade me that he was totally devoid of it him&s;elf? Chide me no longer, my &s;i&s;ter, for what is much more
<PB N="70" REF="84">
my misfortune, than my fault&mdash;and what a misfortune, at my time of life, to look forward to a length of years that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s away,
<Q><L>" Joyle&s;s, lovele&s;s, unindeared!"</L></Q>
May you be happier far! di&s;&s;ipation mu&s;t now be my re&s;ource; 'tis all that I have left&mdash;what a &s;light and worthle&s;s counterpoi&s;e for dome&s;tic felicity!</P>
<P>I will change the &s;ubject. We are to &s;pend the Chri&s;tmas at Southfield&mdash;Lord Lucan, Colonel Walter, and my Lucy, are to accompany us&mdash;next to your&s;elf, &s;he is the mo&s;t agreeable com|panion I could have met with&mdash;her mind is as delicate as her form&mdash;and I can &s;ee that &s;he is frequently hurt at the roughne&s;s of Sir William's manners, tho'
<PB N="71" REF="85">

<P>MY dear Loui&s;a, I have received both your letters, and really think no &s;ituation can be more difficult than yours; but as you &s;ee the precipice before you, I will tru&s;t in that good Providence which is the guardian and &s;upport of inno|cence, that he will enable you to avoid it.&mdash;I am per&s;uaded I felt as much re&s;ent|ment as your&s;elf, on reading Colonel Walter's letter: I perfectly approve of your not &s;hewing it to Sir William; but I cannot by any means divine what could be the motive for writing it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince you mentioned the change in Lord Lucan's behaviour, I have had
<PB N="94" REF="108">
&s;ome apprehen&s;ions of his pa&s;&s;ion for you, but would not hint them, for fear of giv|ing you unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;O, my Loui&s;a! how nicely circum&s;pect mu&s;t your conduct be, if you mean to e&s;cape the dangers that &s;urround you! and how much brighter than gold, &s;even times tried in the fur|nace, will that conduct appear, when it has pa&s;&s;ed through more than a trial or|deal, un&s;ullied, and unhurt!&mdash;</P>
<P>You have never given me the lea&s;t rea|&s;on to apprehend that Sir William is inclinable to jealou&s;y: this is certainly a very fortunate circum&s;tance, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation; but do not &s;uffer your|&s;elf to be lulled into a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, by his apparent indolence; vigilant and watchful mu&s;t that woman be, who has &s;o many foes to &s;hield again&s;t&mdash;the un|kindne&s;s

<P>You have not yet begun to &s;u&s;pect it. It is therefore the more dangerous enemy. Examine it, my &s;i&s;ter; call it to &s;trict ac|count; and if you find one &s;entiment or wi&s;h, that lurks in &s;ecret there, unwor|thy of your&s;elf, bani&s;h it, I be&s;eech you: thoughts, even without purpo&s;es, are criminal, where our honour is in que&s;tion. Con&s;ider the &s;lighte&s;t idea of this kind, as a young &s;erpent; though &s;tingle&s;s now, its growth will give it &s;trength and power to wound the brea&s;t that nur&s;ed and che|ri&s;hed it! cru&s;h it, betimes, Loui&s;a; and be at peace for life.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="110">I weep fa&s;ter than I write; my bro|ther's unhappine&s;s, and yours, have &s;unk my &s;pirits to the lowe&s;t ebb: he is &s;till incon&s;olable.&mdash;He has received a mo&s;t extraordinary letter from brute Colville&mdash;I can call her nothing el&s;e&mdash;&s;he &s;ays,<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"She hopes he has by this time &s;urmounted his grief for her daughter, as it is high|ly irrational to mourn for one who is &s;o &s;urely happy.&mdash;She intreats him to go directly to Paris, as &s;he has &s;ome|thing very particular to inform him of, relative to Delia's la&s;t reque&s;t, which &s;he will not communicate by letter."</Q></P>
<P>This hint has rou&s;ed Sir George's cu|rio&s;ity, or rather awakened the fond de|&s;ire of fulfilling any wi&s;h that Delia might have made; yet he &s;ays he could not bear the fight of Mrs. Colville, whom
<PB N="97" REF="111">
he con&s;iders as her daughter's murderer, and the de&s;troyer of his earthly happi|ne&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>I know not what to think of this affair, but I mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h that he would go any where&mdash;exerci&s;e is always of &s;er|vice to an oppre&s;&s;ed mind&mdash;like the wheels of a machine, it le&s;&s;ens the weight, which re&s;t re&s;tores again&mdash;however, Sir George &s;hall not go by Amiens, if he goes at all, and that I have any power to per&s;uade him.&mdash;</P>
<P>No one can tell where Lord Hume has been, for &s;ome time pa&s;t&mdash;the <HI>only</HI> letter I received was dated from Naples, which he &s;aid he &s;hould quit the next day, and write to me the moment he was determined to fix at any place.&mdash;If

a brother's and &s;i&s;ter's unhappine&s;s did not at pre&s;ent take up all my thoughts, and as it were u&s;urp the place of my own &s;orrow, I could allow it ample &s;cope, Loui&s;a; but I will now re&s;train it, at lea&s;t within my own brea&s;t, and indulge my&s;elf in the more generous &s;en&s;ation of grieving for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e who are more wretched, and not le&s;s dear to me, than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir George returns your love, an hun|dred fold.

<P>YES, my dear Lucan, I will acknow|ledge your cen&s;ure ju&s;t, in &s;ome degree; and that I think is full as much as can be expected from a per&s;on of my lively and volatile di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;we idle fellows are &s;eldom perver&s;e enough to defend our follies; or perhaps the &s;ame indolence of temper which makes us commit, prevents our ju&s;tifying them&mdash;no matter from what principle our hu|mility ari&s;es, I hate &s;earching for remote cau&s;es&mdash;'tis like &s;eeking for a grain of wheat in a bu&s;hel of chaff.

<P>When I landed on the continent, I was &s;uch a novice in love, as to fancy that I could not bear a &s;ix month's ab|&s;ence from Fanny Cleveland; but I had not been &s;ix days acquainted with my pre&s;ent object, when I found that I could &s;acrifice friends, country, nay my&s;elf, to her; I had never felt pa&s;&s;ion before. And <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What's life without pa&s;&s;ion? &s;weet pa&s;&s;ion of love."</Q></P>
<P>I have, I hope, dealt like a man of honour, with Mi&s;s Cleveland, by not di&s;&s;embling with her. I have written but once to her, &s;ince I came here; and
<PB N="106" REF="120">
then told her I intended to &s;tay abroad, for three years, and had not fixed upon any place of re&s;idence; nay even &s;aid I &s;hould quit Naples directly, merely to prevent her writing to me.</P>
<P>I hope &s;he will under&s;tand all this, properly, and that her pride will get the better of whatever regard &s;he might have had for me; and that whenever I return to England, if that &s;hould ever happen, I may find her, what I really wi&s;h, mar|ried intirely to her own &s;atisfaction&mdash;for, notwith&s;tanding my infidelity, I think it impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould ever be capable of dive&s;ting my&s;elf of the warme&s;t intere&s;t in her happine&s;s.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lord LUCAN to Lord HUME.</HEAD>
<P>MY dear Hume, your letter has re|lieved me from a thou&s;and appre|hen&s;ions, which I &s;uffered on your ac|count&mdash;it is written in the true &s;pirit of a heart at ea&s;e, which no man ever po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed that was thoroughly in love&mdash;and though you call me grave and philo&s;o|phic, I am much better plea&s;ed that your pre&s;ent attachment &s;hould be of the fro|lic, than the &s;erious kind.&mdash;Mo&s;t of our young men of fortune and fa&s;hion look upon a foreign mi&s;tre&s;s as a part of their travelling equipage; and I think Marga|rita as well qualified to fill up the train of <HI>milord Anglois,</HI> as any other of her &s;i&s;ter &s;yrens&mdash;of the opera.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="123">I have &s;een her often, and acknow|ledge her beauty, though I could gaze on her for ever, without feeling any other effect from her charms, but what might ari&s;e in my mind from contempla|ting her picture&mdash;yet I do not think her inanimate; on the contrary, &s;he has great vivacity, both in her looks and manners, but alas! &s;he is totally devoid of &s;en&s;i|bility, that fir&s;t of female charms! her eyes are taught to langui&s;h, and every graceful movement of her form has been acquired in the &s;chool of art.&mdash;Read the thirty-&s;eventh and fiftieth letters of Ni|non de l'Enclos, to the marquis de Se|vig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&eacute;, and they will help you to judge more ju&s;tly, both of her and your&s;elf; they are ca&s;es exactly in point.</P>
<P>She lived with the marquis de Riche|lieu, at Turin, when I was there&mdash;I
<PB N="110" REF="124">
knew him intimately; he adored Mar|garita, and was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t and mo&s;t amiable young men I ever met with&mdash;he died of a fever. I pitied Mar|garita from my &s;oul, and about ten days after his death, went to pay her a vi&s;it of condolance, and was informed &s;he had &s;et out for Naples, two days before, with an Engli&s;h gentleman who&s;e name was Williams.</P>
<P>I am much too young to &s;et up for a &s;toic, or a cynic; I know, nay I feel, all the weakne&s;&s;es and follies of youth; yet I cannot help thinking that an at|tachment to a worthle&s;s woman, is capa|ble of deba&s;ing the noble&s;t mind.&mdash;Vir|tue, I fear, is not radical in human na|ture; its &s;eed mu&s;t be &s;own by precept, cheri&s;hed by example, and cultivated
<PB N="111" REF="125">
by habit; but when the object of our af|fections has a di&s;tinct intere&s;t rather to extingui&s;h, than in&s;pire it, the general bias of our pa&s;&s;ions, aided by the natu|ral indolence of di&s;&s;ipation and debau|chery, &s;uffer the plant to wither in its bloom, and thus obliterates the true&s;t character of manhood.</P>
<P>On the contrary, let the mo&s;t vicious man become truly enamoured of a virtu|ous woman, and he will at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ume the &s;emblance of tho&s;e virtues he ad|mires in her, and <Q REND="inline">"U&s;e (as Hamlet &s;ays) can almo&s;t change the &s;tamp of na|ture, and ma&s;ter even the Devil, or throw him out with wonderous po|tency."</Q></P>
<P>I find my&s;elf growing grave prema|turely; for there is but one paragraph
<PB N="112" REF="126">
in your letter, that I meant to an&s;wer &s;e|riou&s;ly: you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s&mdash;I mean the one where you &s;peak of Mi&s;s Cleve|land, and &s;eem to acquie&s;ce &s;o intirely in your behaviour towards her&mdash;and now that I have entered upon this &s;ubject, I am at a lo&s;s to know how to treat it pro|perly&mdash;I would fain per&s;uade my&s;elf you were but in je&s;t; yet &s;urely it is wrong to trifle with the e&s;teem of a friend, by &s;uf|fering me to &s;uppo&s;e that you could po&s;|&s;ibly behave &s;o unworthily to a woman of merit and honour.</P>
<P>That the gaiety and levity of your temper and your youth might render it po&s;&s;ible, nay probable, that you &s;hould change your affections, and cea&s;e to love a mi&s;tre&s;s you once admired, I can rea|dily believe&mdash;but that you can &s;uffer an

amiable woman, whom you both flat|tered, and in&s;pired, with a &s;erious pa&s;|&s;ion for you; to be informed of your in|con&s;tancy, through &s;o coar&s;e a medium as rudene&s;s and neglect, I will not, nay I cannot &s;uppo&s;e.&mdash;My friend knows better what he owes to him&s;elf, and to the world.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed from replying to your queries, relative to the object of my pa&s;&s;ion, except &s;o far as to afford you &s;ome faint de&s;cription of her beauty and merits. Her per&s;onal charms are &s;o obvious, that whoever views her does not wait to judge&mdash;they &s;trike &s;o &s;uddenly that we feel before we think. The excellencies of her character require &s;ome refinement to be|come &s;en&s;ible of&mdash;one mu&s;t have a nice di&s;cernment for natural beauties, and a

<P>In others we may trace the mechanical finger of the nur&s;e, the mother, the tu|tore&s;s, or the prie&s;t&mdash;In her can be di&s;|covered but one only forming hand&mdash;even his who made her.</P>
<P>In fine, &s;uch beauties, both of mind and per&s;on, have in&s;pired your, till now, in&s;en&s;ible friend, with the mo&s;t tender,
<PB N="115" REF="129">
ardent, and hopele&s;s love, that ever yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a human heart! and in my brea&s;t, &s;hall that fond love lie ever buri|ed&mdash;I think it will not cea&s;e even with my life, but death it&s;elf &s;hall never force me to reveal my pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Pre&s;s me no farther on this theme, my friend, nor ca&s;t away your u&s;ele&s;s pity on me; for while I can behold her lovely form, and gaze in &s;ilent rapture on her beauty, I am not wretched&mdash;nay in tho&s;e bli&s;sful moments, I feel a &s;ort of hap|pine&s;s I would not change for all your joys with Margarita.</P>
<P>You may, very probably, have but an imperfect idea of that kind of pa&s;&s;ion, which I have de&s;cribed; but do not from thence unphilo&s;ophically conclude that
<PB N="116" REF="130">
it cannot exi&s;t in any heart, becau&s;e you do not feel it in your own. This I know to be a common, but erroneous mode of judging&mdash;we are all too apt to &s;earch in our own brea&s;ts for the motives of other people's actions; and when a want of &s;ympathy of &s;entiment, prevents our di&s;|covering &s;imilar principles in our&s;elves, we are too often tempted to deny their exi&s;tence in others.</P>
<P>I have particularly warn'd you, my dear Hume, on this &s;ubject, becau&s;e I am certain I could full as ea&s;ily forgive your doubting my honour, as the un&s;ul|lied purity of my pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I mo&s;t &s;in|cerely wi&s;h you every plea&s;ure that a life of frolic and gayety can yield, but be|ware, my dear Hume, of tho&s;e thorns, that grow &s;pontaneous with the ro&s;e.</P>

<P>But why you are &s;o cruelly bent upon not indulging her with a repetition of her triumph, I cannot for my &s;oul conceive&mdash;I have formed a million of conjectures, about whom and what &s;he is; and have at length acquie&s;ced in believing her to be the &s;anctified &s;pou&s;e of &s;ome method|i&s;t teacher, or pre&s;byterian par&s;on; for

that Lord Lucan is va&s;tly more chearful, and &s;eemingly at his ea&s;e, than he was before we left Dublin&mdash;indeed I think we are all &s;o: which &s;erves to illu&s;|trate your favourite opinion, as well as the latter part of your la&s;t letter, that air, exerci&s;e, and change of objects, are of infinite u&s;e, both to the mind and body.</P>
<P>From my not mentioning my bro|ther, till now, do not conclude that I have for a moment forgotten him, or his griefs; they will live together in my memory, to the la&s;t period of my exi&s;tence.&mdash;I cannot conceive why Mrs. Colville &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee Sir George, as &s;he mu&s;t be con&s;cious of having done him an irreparable injury; and &s;ure there is nothing on earth &s;o formi|dable, as the &s;ight of a per&s;on we have
<PB N="129" REF="143">
wronged.&mdash;Yet I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that he knew his Delia's reque&s;t, as the obeying it would afford him a very high, though a melancholy plea&s;ure&mdash;<Q><L>" Sad luxury! to vulgar minds unknown."</L></Q></P>
<P>I wi&s;h too, with you, that he would go abroad.&mdash;Do, my Fanny, &s;end him to &s;earch for your wanderer, on the conti|nent; and in the mean time do you take &s;anctuary in this i&s;land, which boa&s;ts a privilege of being free from all noi&s;ome animals&mdash;you may therefore at lea&s;t pro|mi&s;e your&s;elf &s;afety, if not delight, among&s;t us.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for the change you mention in Mary Granville; her charming viva|city would, I hoped, have a&s;&s;i&s;ted you in keeping up your &s;pirits, under the tre|ble
<PB N="130" REF="144">
pre&s;&s;ure of my brother's, mine, and your own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which I begin to fear will &s;oon outweigh our's, for I think that even the death of the object of our affections is more &s;upportable than their unkindne&s;s.&mdash;This hint is meant to arm you; for, I confe&s;s, that Lord Hume's &s;i|lence has made me think he is in the high road of incon&s;tancy; and I do mo&s;t earn|e&s;tly wi&s;h that you would endeavour to forget him, and be happy.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, at your re|que&s;t, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly examined my heart, and will candidly acquaint you with its real &s;ituation&mdash;'Tis free from love, and thence is all its danger.&mdash;O! why am I debarred the cha&s;te indulgence of a virtuous pa&s;&s;ion? why mu&s;t a heart that overflows with tenderne&s;s, have all
<PB N="131" REF="145">
its currents dammed? like a poor river forced from its natural cour&s;e, am I to blame if it &s;hould &s;teal away in u&s;ele&s;s, nay improper channels?</P>
<P>But hitherto, my &s;i&s;ter, all is &s;afe&mdash;the man I mo&s;t e&s;teem, I have no pa&s;&s;ion for, nor feel a fonder warmth, on men|tioning his name, than my dear bro|ther's&mdash;this &s;urely is an innocent affec|tion&mdash;Had I been his wife!&mdash;but you have warned me not even to hazard, much le&s;s indulge, &s;uch thoughts.</P>
<P>Harriet is va&s;tly happy at your pre|dilection for her, and bids me offer you the &s;econd place in her heart&mdash;&s;he kind|ly, and I believe at pre&s;ent truly &s;ays, I occupy the fir&s;t&mdash;yours is, I think, likely to be the mo&s;t permanent &s;tation;
<PB N="132" REF="146">
as I &s;hall have many rivals to contend for mine, and happy will he be who &s;hall di&s;place me.&mdash;</P>
<P>Lucy, who came hither with me, is this day gone to pay her re&s;pects to her aunt, at Mr U&s;her's; we are to meet them at Walter&s;burgh, next Monday; and &s;he is then to return with me to Southfield, where we have, alas! but a very few days to &s;pend, before we &s;et out for Dublin: I &s;hall truly regret the changing of the &s;cene&mdash;but mu&s;t obey.</P>
<P>Sir William returns his affectionate compliments to my brother, and you, and was kind enough to &s;ay he wi&s;hed you would both come over, and &s;ee how we live here&mdash;what is &s;till more extra|ordinary, he &s;eemed both &s;urpri&s;ed and

You &s;ee how I &s;trive to &s;ooth my|&s;elf, and plead for him. He &s;ays he can|not be per&s;uaded that &s;he could die, in three days, unle&s;s it were of a French phy&s;ician.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>REPORT does not always exag|gerate&mdash;Mi&s;s A&s;hford is really beautiful&mdash;the ladies of this country are in general remarkably fair, but the whitene&s;s of her &s;kin &s;urpa&s;&s;es any that I have ever &s;een; her eyes are dark hazel, her hair jet black, which forms &s;uch a contra&s;t to her neck and forehead, as images Shake&s;pear's &s;imile,
<Q><L>" Fairer than &s;now upon a raven's back."</L></Q></P>
<P>She is tall and thin, and though not elegantly made, appears perfectly gen|teel&mdash;while &s;he &s;its &s;till&mdash;but the mo|ment &s;he is thrown into motion, or emo|tion, &s;he cea&s;es to be lovely&mdash;a &s;omething
<PB N="135" REF="149">
more than want of grace accompanies her action, and every movement of her head, or hands, &s;eems performed in op|po&s;ition to nature&mdash;in &s;hort &s;he is the only young per&s;on I have ever &s;een, whom vivacity does not become. She &s;eems &s;en|&s;ible, mild, good-natured, and in every re&s;pect qualified for making an amiable figure&mdash;in <HI>&s;till life.</HI></P>
<P>I am much plea&s;ed to find that Sir William is extremely ho&s;pitable to his country neighbours, and likes to have company in his hou&s;e. This tendency may doubtle&s;s be attended with &s;ome in|conveniences, which I had rather &s;ubmit to, than live unknown and unloved, among&s;t one's tenants and dependants&mdash;it is their indu&s;try and labour which &s;up|ports our affluence, and they certainly
<PB N="136" REF="150">
have a right to a certain &s;hare in our en|joyments, in proportion to their rank and &s;ituation.</P>
<P>An accident that happened this morn|ing, had like to have triumphed over Sir William's good humour, which is not of the invincible kind.&mdash;As we &s;at at breakfa&s;t, in a room that looks into the garden, I ob&s;erved Mi&s;s A&s;hford's eyes fixed on a particular object, in the walk before us&mdash;I thought &s;he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and I naturally directed a look of inquiry, to di&s;cover the occa&s;ion; which was a little ba&s;ket, that appeared to move, though gently, of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The moment I mentioned this circum|&s;tance, the gentlemen came to the win|dow, and Lord Lucan flew directly into the
<PB N="137" REF="151">
garden, and explained the phenomenon, by bringing the ba&s;ket and its contents into the parlour, which was an infant, about a week old, clean, though poorly clad, with a paper pinned to its brea&s;t, which &s;aid, <HI>this child has been baptized by its father's name, William.</HI></P>
<P>This circum&s;tance di&s;concerted Sir William, who, after many unnece&s;&s;ary a&s;|&s;everations of his innocence, upon this oc|ca&s;ion, at which the whole company &s;miled, as they knew that he had been above a year out of the kingdom, deter|mined to prove his virtue, at the ex|pence of his humanity, by ordering the child to be again left in the garden where it was found, till the pari&s;h officers &s;hould come to take charge of it; and by commanding a &s;trict &s;earch to be
<PB N="138" REF="152">
made for the mother, that &s;he might be puni&s;hed, <HI>according to law.</HI></P>
<P>We all oppo&s;ed the &s;everity of this re&s;olution, as the poor infant appeared almo&s;t peri&s;hed with cold, and hunger; but Sir William per&s;i&s;ted in acting like an upright magi&s;trate, according to the <HI>letter of the law</HI>&mdash;till Lord Lucan declared that he was ready to adopt the little foundling, and promi&s;ed to take care of it for life, though his name was Tho|mas. Sir William then relaxed a little of his au&s;terity, and gave vent to the re|mainder of it by attacking Lord Lucan with all the coar&s;e raillery u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was plea&s;ed with this in|&s;tance of his Lord&s;hip's humanity&mdash;I
<PB N="139" REF="153">
have &s;een many others, even in the &s;hort term of our acquaintance&mdash;yet, at this in|&s;tant, I could wi&s;h to have robbed him of this little act of benevolence, and have transferred it to Sir William&mdash;There is a &s;ecret and involuntary &s;ympathy, that at|taches us to generous minds&mdash;our affec|tions are in&s;en&s;ibly rivetted by e&s;teem, and in that ca&s;e we may defy even the power of time to break the charming tye! O, why am I not bound in &s;uch a chain!</P>
<P>Though you will &s;ee by my letter, that I had nothing to &s;ay when I began to write, yet as it is probable that I &s;hall not have half an hour's lei&s;ure, for &s;ome days to come, I have devoted the pre&s;ent moment to convince my Fanny that &s;he is never ab&s;ent from my thoughts, to en|quire

<P>MY deare&s;t Fanny, I lay hold of the fir&s;t po&s;&s;ible moment to calm your fears for my &s;afety, I mean with re|gard to my health: Harriet, by my de|&s;ire, has given you an account of the accident that befel me here; but &s;he and all the world are &s;trangers to the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>But before I enter into a detail, that mu&s;t affect you, let me congratulate my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter upon the timely di&s;covery of lord Hume's incon&s;tancy&mdash;Rejoice, my Fanny, that this worthle&s;s man is not your hu&s;band! and that you are at
<PB N="153" REF="167">
liberty to indulge your re&s;entment, or contempt, <HI>without a breach of duty</HI>&mdash;This, though you may not be &s;en&s;ible of it, is certainly an allevation of the mi|&s;ery which ari&s;es from ill-placed love&mdash;but time, and your &s;en&s;e and virtue will, I hope, enable you to triumph over any remain of weakne&s;s, for &s;uch an un|worthy object&mdash;Yet, contemptible as he is, I cannot help being plea&s;ed with his letter; frankne&s;s always charms me, and, like charity, in my mind it covers a multitude of faults.</P>
<P>Do not, from what I have &s;aid, ima|gine that I think lightly of your pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s; I am convinced, that to a heart tender and good as yours, it mu&s;t be &s;e|vere; but I al&s;o know, that there are other &s;ituations much more intolerable,

<P>Sir Arthur, Mi&s;s A&s;hford, Lord Lu|can, Sir William, Harriet, and I, &s;et out together for this place, the Monday after I wrote to you&mdash;We were to have met Mrs. Layton, Mi&s;s Lei&s;ter, the family of the U&s;hers, and &s;everal other ladies and gentlemen of the neighbourhood&mdash;The fir&s;t mortification I received, was hearing that my Lucy was ill of a &s;ore throat, and could not come from U&s;her's Grove; her aunt, and the re&s;t of the fa|mily came, but were all to return after &s;upper.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="169">I told you, in my la&s;t, that I had re|fu&s;ed to dance with Colonel Walter; I was al&s;o a&s;ked by Lord Lucan, but de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, and entreated he would take Mi&s;s A&s;hford for his partner. He &s;aid he would obey me, and accord|ingly de&s;ired the honour of her hand, which &s;he readily granted&mdash;About a quar|ter of an hour before the ball began, he unluckily &s;trained his leg, and was not able to fulfil his engagement.&mdash;Sir Wil|liam, though not fond of dancing, was polite enough to &s;upply his place, and Lord Lucan and I were reduced to play at quadrille, with a couple of dowagers, and an old par&s;on.</P>
<P>The evening, however, pa&s;&s;ed off, very tolerably, and we retired to our cham|bers about twelve o'clock. The gentle|men
<PB N="156" REF="170">
had agreed to meet and hunt, the next morning; and I determined to pay a vi&s;it to Lucy, between breakfa&s;t and dinner, that day; for the Colonel had in&s;i&s;ted on our not leaving him till the next.</P>
<P>According to appointment with his companions of the chace, Sir William ro&s;e early, and left me a&s;leep; I had re|&s;olved not to acquaint him with my &s;itu|ation, till our return to Southfield; as I knew that many coar&s;e je&s;ts and com|mon-place &s;ayings would pa&s;s, on the occa&s;ion; which I &s;hould wi&s;h to avoid, at all times, but e&s;pecially before &s;trangers.</P>

only di&s;tingui&s;h that it was a man, and in&s;tantly concluded him to be Lord Lu|can; from this circum&s;tance only, that I recollected Colonel Walter was to have rode out with Sir William.&mdash;I &s;trove to withdraw my hand, but could not; upon which I addre&s;&s;ed him with the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urprize and re&s;entment, at his having dared to take &s;o unwarrant|able a liberty; to which, he an&s;wered, only in a whi&s;per, entreating me to for|give the effects of a pa&s;&s;ion too violent to be re&s;trained.&mdash;He then attempted to pre&s;s his lips to mine, and when I was going to ring my bell, I heard Sir William's voice upon the &s;tairs, and fainted.</P>
<P>When I came to my&s;elf, I found Mi&s;s A&s;hford, Sir William, and Harriet, in
<PB N="158" REF="172">
the room, &s;tanding about my bed-&s;ide&mdash;I &s;uffered infinite anxiety at that in&s;tant, to know whether Sir William had found Lord Lucan in my chamber, and what had pa&s;&s;ed between them? Harriet and Mi&s;s A&s;hford were bathing my temples with lavender water, while Sir William held one of my hands between his, and as &s;oon as he found that I was recover|ing, pre&s;s'd it gently, and withdrew; &s;ay|ing that he &s;uppo&s;ed ladies under|&s;tood how to manage one another better, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, than he&mdash;his calm|ne&s;s amazed me! in &s;hort the various emotions of my mind, for &s;ome time, are not to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I determined, on the in&s;tant, to return to Southfield directly, let the con&s;equence be what it would; and never to &s;uffer
<PB N="159" REF="173">
Lord Lucan to come into my &s;ight again; but, alas! when I attempted to ri&s;e, I found it impo&s;&s;ible; the agitation of my mind, had di&s;order'd my whole frame; my illne&s;s encrea&s;ed every moment, a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched for a phy&s;ician, but before he could arrive&mdash;</P>
<P>When Sir William was informed of my misfortune, he raved and &s;tamped like a mad-man; &s;aid I mu&s;t have de&s;igned to de&s;troy his heir, out of perver&s;ene&s;s, or I would certainly have acquainted him with my &s;ituation&mdash;while, Heaven knows, I would have given my own life, with plea&s;ure, to have &s;aved my child.</P>
<P>I continued in a &s;tate of &s;uch extreme weakne&s;s, for four days, that I &s;aw no creature but Ben&s;on, who had been &s;ent
<PB N="160" REF="174">
for expre&s;s, the doctor, and Harriet who wept continually by me&mdash;I never can forget the dear girl's tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the fifth morning, Sir William came into the room, and with an air of the ut|mo&s;t di&s;atisfaction, told me he was very &s;orry for the lo&s;s of his boy, but hoped I &s;hould do well; and as he could not be of any u&s;e to a &s;ick per&s;on, he had re&s;ol|ved to attend the meeting of parliament, and &s;hould &s;et out for Dublin, with the Colonel and Lord Lucan, directly&mdash;that as &s;oon as I was able, I might either re|turn to Southfield, or follow him to town, as I liked be&s;t.&mdash;But that I need not be in a hurry to move, for his <HI>good friend</HI> had left orders that I &s;hould be as well at|tended, as if I were in my own hou&s;e; and that Lucy Lei&s;ter was now recovered,
<PB N="161" REF="175">
and would come that day to Walter&s;burg, to keep me company.&mdash;He then gave me a cool ki&s;s, and withdrew.</P>
<P>I rejoiced extremely, at hearing that Lord Lucan was to go with Sir William; for though my life was at &s;take, I would not have remained in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, after my hu&s;band had left it; be|&s;ides it &s;aved me the difficulty of an inter|view, which my poor weak brain had been &s;tudying to avoid, the whole time of my illne&s;s&mdash;Yet I had doubts and fears that he might in&s;olently have made a pre|tence to &s;tay behind, till Ben&s;on a&s;&s;ured me that &s;he &s;aw him &s;et out, at the &s;ame time with Sir William and the Colonel.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was going off, he gave the enclo&s;ed note to Harriet, to deliver to
<PB N="162" REF="176">
me as &s;oon as I &s;hould be able to read it; the &s;weet girl could not conceal her emotion about it, &s;he feared &s;he had done wrong in receiving it, and, with her cheeks covered with blu&s;hes, and her eyes filled with tears, &s;he pre&s;ented it to me, beg|ging I would excu&s;e her if &s;he had acted improperly.</P>
<P>I never was more embarra&s;&s;ed, in my life, than at that moment; I could have no doubt but that his letter was filled with apologies for the audaciou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct, and to read it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure to admit of his excu&s;es.&mdash;But while I he&s;itated, Harriet, who&s;e impa|tience &s;eemed to be extreme, had broken the &s;eal, and &s;aid, &s;hall I read it to you, Madam? Luckily for me that part of the chamber I &s;at in, was &s;o much dark|ened
<PB N="163" REF="177">
by a large &s;creen, that &s;he did not di&s;cover my confu&s;ion; therefore taking my &s;ilence for con&s;ent, &s;he proceeded to read, as follows.</P>

<P>I never felt &s;urpri&s;e more &s;trongly, than at hearing this letter; and my amaze|ment was rather increa&s;ed, by the tre|pidation and hurry of Harriet's voice and manner, in reading it, who, on the in&s;tant

&s;he had fini&s;hed, de&s;ired I would give her leave to write his lord&s;hip an ac|count of my health, by that very night's po&s;t.&mdash;This I ab&s;olutely forbad; but, in order to change the &s;ubject, told her I would employ her in a more intere&s;ting corre&s;pondence, and de&s;ired &s;he would immediately write to you.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s to you, Fanny, that Lord Lucan's letter has puzzled me &s;o much, that I &s;ometimes think it impo&s;&s;ible he could have been guilty of the in&s;ult I have charged him with, and not attempt|ed to have made &s;ome apology for it.&mdash;Yet who el&s;e could have dared to enter my chamber; or, indeed, who el&s;e was in the hou&s;e, at the time? I am almo&s;t tempted to per&s;uade my&s;elf, &s;ometimes, that it was only a dream or vi&s;ion, that

alarmed me&mdash;at other times my mind &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome &s;cruples to it&s;elf, for not having acquainted Sir William with the affair.&mdash;But then again, in that ca&s;e, I mu&s;t have hazarded my hu&s;band's and &s;ome other per&s;on's life! dreadful though! No, let me rather &s;uffer all that fate can inflict on innocence, than be the cau&s;e of one man's death, or mi&s;ery!</P>
<P>The moment that Lord Lucan left the hou&s;e, I felt as if a weight had been taken off my heart&mdash;I have grown better every hour &s;ince, and the company of my Lucy and Harriet makes me not re|gret the ab&s;ence of any other per&s;on, but your&s;elf&mdash;For heaven's &s;ake, my deare&s;t Fanny, no longer deny me and your&s;elf the indulgence of &s;haring my heart, and alleviating its anxieties! you have now

<P>WHY mu&s;t I tell my dear Loui&s;a, that the contents of her letter abated the plea&s;ure I received from &s;ee|ing that her hand had &s;uper&s;cribed it? this little circum&s;tance gave me an idea of your perfect recovery, while the &s;ame characters on the in&s;ide, trace out a tale of unhappine&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s! and who can hope for health, while the mind &s;uf|fers?</P>
<P>There is &s;omething very extraordinary, in the adventure you have met with,
<PB N="169" REF="183">
at Walter&s;burgh; but your &s;urmi&s;e on that occa&s;ion does not appear to me to have the lea&s;t foundation&mdash;on the con|trary, I would almo&s;t hazard any bett, that Lord Lucan was incapable of treat|ing you with &s;uch di&s;re&s;pect. It is im|po&s;&s;ible, I think, from the whole con|tour of his character, to &s;uppo&s;e that he could be guilty of &s;uch an outrage to de|cency and honour; &s;till more incredible to believe, that he &s;hould never &s;ince have thought proper to offer any &s;ort of excu&s;e for &s;uch a behaviour, e&s;pecially as he proceeded &s;o far as to frame an oppor|tunity to him&s;elf for doing &s;o, by the <HI>re&s;pectful freedom</HI> of his letter to you; for an action too, which was &s;o unfortu|nate in its con&s;equences, to the woman he loves&mdash;for that he loves, is but too obvious.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="184">Who then could it be?

<P>I am very &s;orry, that Sir William &s;hould have &s;hewn more regret for the lo&s;s of his &s;on, than concern for your ill|ne&s;s; but parental fondne&s;s is, I fear, a &s;tronger and more general affection, in male minds, than conjugal love.&mdash;But, indeed, my dear, you de&s;erve a little mortification for your fal&s;e deli|cacy, in concealing your &s;ituation from him; &s;o ki&s;s the rod, and have done
<PB N="171" REF="185">
whimpering, as we &s;ay to naughty chil|dren.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h that the bu&s;ine&s;s of parliament had not called Sir William from home, at this juncture; I long till he and you are &s;ettled in a dome&s;tic way, at Southfield&mdash;I own I am alarmed at a married woman's meeting with ad|ventures of the novel kind&mdash;in the ab|&s;ence of her hu&s;band&mdash;<Q><L>" The wife, where danger or di&s;honour lurks,</L>

<P>To &s;ay truth, I think you in almo&s;t as much danger as our fair mother, to whom the&s;e words were addre&s;&s;ed, for there certainly is a &s;erpent in the gra&s;s, &s;ome|where, <HI>autour de vous</HI>&mdash;You have, how|ever, the advantage of being warned of

<P>I receive your congratulation as I am &s;ure it is meant; and though my mind is not yet &s;trong enough to con&s;ider the di&s;covery of Lord Hume's incon&s;tancy, as a &s;ubject for rejoicing at, yet I agree with you, that had this change in his af|fections happened after I had become his wife, the misfortune would have cer|tainly been more in&s;upportable; though I cannot, even at pre&s;ent, avail my&s;elf of

the re&s;ource you offer me, of hating or de&s;pi&s;ing a man whom I once loved&mdash;The utmo&s;t I ever hope to arrive at, is to be able to &s;peak of my affection for him, in the pa&s;t ten&s;e only; and the mo&s;t effectual way to arrive at that end, is to mention him as little as po&s;&s;ible, for the future.

<P>DEAR Hume, I &s;hould be extreme|ly plea&s;ed, if I could, like you, con&s;ider the transformation of Ovid, as a &s;eries of &s;erious and natural events; for as I have, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, be|come extremely weary of my pre&s;ent form or mode of exi&s;tence, I &s;hould be inclined to flatter my&s;elf, that any change mu&s;t be for the better; but the metem|p&s;ycho&s;is of Pythagoras would &s;uit me &s;till better than the metamorpho&s;es of Ovid; I &s;hould like to carry my identity with me, into whatever being my &s;pirit was appointed to animate, as I think the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ufferings I now en|dure, would render any &s;tate, except
<PB N="175" REF="189">
that of a ferocious animal, agreeable to me.</P>
<P>But to be &s;erious&mdash;I have been, for &s;ome months pa&s;t, uncommonly wretch|ed; the fate of her who is the arbiter of mine, hung for an age in doubtful bal|lance. I never knew the extreme of mi|&s;ery, till then; for, alas! I had never before given my&s;elf leave to think &s;he was mortal! Yes, Hume, all that I love in life was near the grave! and I &s;u&s;tained the &s;hock like a philo&s;opher&mdash;I &s;ighed and wept in &s;ecret; while to the world I wore the &s;pecious ma&s;k of mere humanity.&mdash;This was as much as I had power to do; and he that &s;ays philo&s;ophy can go be|yond this mark, and teach us not to feel, mi&s;takes its u&s;e, and makes dull apathy u&s;urp its place.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="190">I don't know that ever I felt &s;o much plea&s;ure in writing as at this moment; it certainly relieves our oppre&s;&s;ion to un|burthen our hearts, and you are my on|ly confidant&mdash;This declaration may ap|pear &s;trange to you, who know &s;o little of the particulars of my attachment; but when I affirm, that no per&s;on breathing knows &s;o much, not even the dear ob|ject of it, you may, nay you mu&s;t, ac|cept the title.</P>
<P>From your la&s;t letter, which I have read over &s;everal times, I have collected two things which give me &s;incere plea|&s;ure, but will &s;urpri&s;e you extreme|ly; the fir&s;t is, that you endeavour to per&s;uade your&s;elf that you love Mar|garita much better than you really do: and the &s;econd, that you not only re|&s;pect
<PB N="177" REF="191">
and e&s;teem, but &s;till love Mi&s;s Cleveland! I hope you have written to her, Hume&mdash;Every woman of worth and honour has, and ought to have, a pro|per pride; neglect is therefore the mo&s;t unpardonable of all offences that a man can commit&mdash;I &s;peak of men, not brutes; rudene&s;s is, of cour&s;e, out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I was extremely diverted at the many ridiculous ideas you formed of the object of my pa&s;&s;ion; but this, be a&s;&s;ured of, and let it &s;atisfy you, that neither her mind or body have been perverted by any kind of art, but that &s;he is at this in&s;tant the mo&s;t perfect work of the great and univer&s;al Arti&s;t, that I have ever yet beheld! though perhaps &s;he may not have &s;truck you, (for you have

&s;een her,) with the &s;ame idea of per|fection.</P>
<P>I perfectly agree with you that the word <HI>happine&s;s</HI> has as many various mean|ings, as there are tempers and con&s;titu|tions in the world; to confine it there|fore to any ta&s;te, pa&s;&s;ion, or mode of life, would be ju&s;t as ab&s;urd as to drain your ponds, that your fi&s;h may fly; and flood your aviaries, that your birds may &s;wim.

<P>I Have often told you, my dear Lu|can, that I never trouble my&s;elf to inve&s;tigate cau&s;es for any thing that hap|pens; effects are enough for me: &s;o that whether your <HI>tran&s;mogrification</HI> be according to the Ovidian, or Pythago|rean &s;y&s;tem, is of no &s;ort of con&s;equence; for <HI>tran&s;mogrified</HI> you are, to all intents and purpo&s;es&mdash;You may divert your&s;elf with looking for the etymology of that <HI>word,</HI> but though I don't believe you will be able to find its derivation in any dictionary, it is a devili&s;h good one, for all that, and truly expre&s;&s;ive of my meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="194">Why, my dear metamorpho&s;ed friend, you had nothing of the <HI>Catullus</HI> &s;train in you, while you lived among us here.

<P>Margarita and I have been here this fortnight, and in that time we have con|trived to lo&s;e a good round &s;um at play: &s;he thinks we have been overmatched, by the Venetians, and wants to try our for|tune at Rome; but I mu&s;t wait for re|mittances from England, before I can make this or any other experiment of the kind.</P>
<P>You are mi&s;taken, Lucan. I love Mar|garita mo&s;t truly; and, what is much more extraordinary, my affection for her
<PB N="182" REF="196">
rather increa&s;es than abates&mdash;I have my|&s;elf been made &s;en&s;ible of this, tho' not in the mo&s;t agreeable manner; for I have lately felt &s;omewhat of that hydra of ca|lamities, jealou&s;y&mdash;and this, though I am perfectly &s;atisfied that my &s;weet girl gave me no &s;ort of cau&s;e, on her part, and would not quit me, for an emperor&mdash;<Q><L>" Tell me, my heart, if this be love?"</L></Q></P>
<P>You are in &s;ome mea&s;ure right, with regard to my &s;entiments for Fanny Cleveland.&mdash;I certainly do mo&s;t tho|roughly e&s;teem her, and have given the &s;tronge&s;t proof of my having an high opinion of her under&s;tanding, by wri|ting a very fooli&s;h letter, acknowledging my&s;elf, what, I dare &s;ay, your wi&s;e wor|&s;hip already thinks me, a very &s;illy fel|low.&mdash;I don't know, but as you &s;ay, I may love her too&mdash;that is, according

<P><PB N="184" REF="198">It is now two o'clock at noon, and Margarita has not yet ble&s;&s;ed my eyes; I fear &s;he is not well&mdash;I mu&s;t go to en|quire her health.

day after I wrote la&s;t to you, as the wea|ther was remarkably fine, for the &s;ea&s;on, I in&s;i&s;ted on Lucy and Harriet's going out to take the air; and, in order to hard|en my&s;elf for my removal, I ventured into the room adjoining mine, which is a very large and hand&s;ome library.&mdash;Ben&s;on had told me, that, &s;ince the Colo|nel went to Dublin, &s;he had &s;ometimes &s;een a beautiful little girl, of four years old, running about the hou&s;e, but that the child could not &s;peak Engli&s;h; and that the &s;ervants were extremely ill-na-natured to the poor baby, who u&s;ed to weep when &s;he could not make her&s;elf under&s;tood; that &s;he was perfectly enga|ging in her manner, and &s;eemed to take a liking to Ben&s;on; that &s;he had en|quired, as much as was proper, who the child belonged to, and was con&s;tantly

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE moment I had read Mrs. Wal|ter's letter, I &s;ent Ben&s;on to wait her coming at the appointed place.&mdash;As &s;ome of the family were not yet gone to bed, I had near half an hour's lei&s;ure to reflect on the uncommon villainy of Co|lonel Walter! If this lady was his wife, which I could have no doubt of, from her taking his name, how did he dare to propo&s;e marriage to Mrs. Layton? But this circum&s;tance appeared trifling, when compared to the inhumanity of his beha|viour to the unfortunate Olivia, and her lovely child! At length Ben&s;on tapped &s;oftly at my door, and I ro&s;e to receive
<PB N="198" REF="212">
a being that &s;eemed no longer an inha|bitant of this world.&mdash;From the child's account of her mother's illne&s;s, I was prepared to &s;ee a per&s;on pale, and ema|ciated; but any thing &s;o near our idea of a beautiful &s;pectre, never yet, I believe, &s;truck mortal &s;ight.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t de&s;cribe her to you&mdash;her &s;tature is &s;ome-what above the middle &s;ize, but the extreme thinne&s;s of her figure, made her appear &s;till taller&mdash;her eyes are large, and of the darke&s;t blue; her no&s;e aquiline, with the mo&s;t beautiful mouth and teeth I ever &s;aw; her &s;kin fairer than alaba&s;ter, and &s;o clear, that one might fancy they &s;aw the circulation of the blood, which &s;upplied a faint blu&s;hing in her cheeks, re&s;embling the inner tints of a white ro&s;e; her hair of a light &s;hining brown,
<PB N="199" REF="213">
flowed in loo&s;e tre&s;&s;es upon her &s;houl|ders&mdash;her gown was a white &s;ilk polo|ne&s;e; &s;he had on a gauze hood, tied loo&s;e|ly under her chin, and a &s;light covering of the &s;ame &s;ort, upon her neck; &s;he ap|peared all form without &s;ub&s;tance, &s;pirit without matter; and had &s;he prophe&s;ied, my faith would have li&s;tened, as to an angel.&mdash;</P>
<P>As &s;he entered my room, &s;he made an effort, which I was not lucky enough to prevent, to throw her&s;elf at my feet&mdash;when I attempted to rai&s;e her from the ground, I had not &s;trength &s;ufficient, for &s;he had fainted there; with Ben&s;on's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and mine, &s;he recovered, in about ten minutes, then gu&s;hed into &s;uch a flood of tears, as took away all power of
<PB N="200" REF="214">
&s;peech, and almo&s;t &s;uffocated her; &s;he often tried to &s;peak, and implore my pardon for the di&s;tre&s;s and trouble &s;he had occa&s;ioned me; and you may &s;up|po&s;e that I &s;aid every thing in my power to calm her mind.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he became a little col|lected, &s;he &s;aid it was joy, not &s;orrow, that had overpowered her weak frame; the latter &s;he had been too familiar with, but the former was indeed &s;uch a long ab&s;ent gue&s;t, that it mu&s;t be welcomed with &s;ome degree of tran&s;port.&mdash;If the delicacy of her &s;entiments had needed any addition, they would have received the highe&s;t from the &s;weetne&s;s of her voice, and the uncommon beauty of her mouth, while &s;he uttered them.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="215">In order to re&s;train her acknowlege|ments for my intere&s;ting my&s;elf about her and her child, I pre&s;&s;ed her to relate her &s;tory, and to account for the extra|ordinary appearances ari&s;ing from her &s;ituation. She bowed, and proceeded with &s;o much grace and elegance of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, that I could have hung with mute attention on her &s;peech, for a whole winter's night, or a long &s;ummer's day, and never wi&s;hed her tale to have an end!</P>
<P>The Story of Mrs. WALTER.</P>
<P>I had the misfortune to lo&s;e my father, who had the honour of being a general officer in the king of Sardinia's &s;ervice, when I was but eleven years old; his name was d'Alemberg&mdash;as he had many great and lucrative employments; and my mother and he were both young,
<PB N="202" REF="216">
they indulged them&s;elves in a thought|le&s;s extravagance together, at Turin, du|ring his life&mdash;But at his decea&s;e, my mo|ther, no longer able to &s;upport the rank &s;he had held at that court, retired to Brian&ccedil;on, to live upon the &s;mall pa|trimony which remained for her and me.</P>
<P>Young as I was, the lo&s;s of a fond father made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind; and the perpetual affliction to which I &s;aw my mother had devoted her|&s;elf, and which terminated her life in two years, brought me full early ac|quainted with &s;orrow.</P>
<P>After this irreparable lo&s;s, I remained at Brian&ccedil;on, under the care of an old maiden aunt of my father's, who had lived too much &s;eque&s;tered from the
<PB N="203" REF="217">
world, and who, ignorant of the nature of youth, or how to guide it, &s;upplied the place of in&s;truction, with au&s;terity, never &s;uffered me to be a moment out of her &s;ight, and was for ever extol|ling her own goodne&s;s and charity, in being troubled with the care of my edu|cation and maintenance.&mdash;In &s;hort, her manners were perfectly di&s;agreeable, and &s;o extremely different from that delicacy and tenderne&s;s, to which I had been too much accu&s;tomed, that, tho' I &s;trove to re&s;pect her, as my aunt, I found it impo&s;|&s;ible either to love or e&s;teem her.&mdash;The affections of young and amiable minds cannot center in them&s;elves; and if they are not properly attached by the ties of affinity, or kindne&s;s, they will mo&s;t probably be&s;tow them&s;elves on impro|per objects.&mdash;This was unluckily my ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="218">The only per&s;on I was &s;uffered to conver&s;e with, except my aunt, and that only at home, was a girl about three years elder than my&s;elf, who&s;e mother had been formerly a &s;ervant to mine, but at that time kept an inn at Brian&ccedil;on.&mdash;This girl then, as was natural, I became extremely fond of; and as my aunt grew every day more infirm, and was often confined to her bed, I found frequent opportunities of vi&s;iting my dear Nan|nette, unknown to my &s;evere guardian, at her mother's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e, till then, innocent excur&s;ions, my ill fate contrived that Colonel Walter &s;hould arrive at Brian&ccedil;on, and &s;top at the hou&s;e where I was&mdash;It was &s;ummer, the evening fine, and, as he had no company, he &s;auntered into
<PB N="205" REF="219">
the garden, where Nannette and I were &s;itting at work, in an arbour&mdash;He ac|co&s;ted us with great politene&s;s, and I could perceive that my companion was highly plea&s;ed with his addre&s;s&mdash;But the timidity natural to a per&s;on who had been brought up in &s;o retired a manner as I had been, made me wi&s;h to with|draw; and, notwith&s;tanding his, and Nannette's &s;olicitations to the contrary, I quickly returned home, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the fir&s;t idea I had ever felt, of having done wrong.</P>
<P>I &s;aw, by the Colonel's appearance, that he was an officer; the recollection of my father &s;truck forcibly into my mind, and I blu&s;hed with indignation to think that general d'Alemberg's daughter had been &s;een in &s;o improper a &s;ituation.
<PB N="206" REF="220">
My pride was, however, con&s;oled by thinking that I &s;hould never &s;ee him again; and I determined to be more guarded, in my future vi&s;its to my friend.</P>
<P>The next morning, very early, Nan|nette was at my bed&s;ide, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome degree of re&s;entment at my hav|ing quitted her &s;o abruptly, the preceed|ing night&mdash;my delicacy would not &s;uffer me to hurt her pride, by telling her my real motive for retiring; I there|fore &s;aid that it was owing to my appre|hen&s;ions of being mi&s;&s;ed by my aunt; but that I got off undi&s;covered, and &s;hould not be &s;o cowardly, another time: &s;he &s;eemed &s;atisfied with this declaration, and pre&s;&s;ed me to come to her, that evening. She had an intire a&s;cendant over me, and notwith&s;tanding the re&s;o|lution
<PB N="207" REF="221">
I had made a few hours before, I readily promi&s;ed to attend her.</P>
<P>I had no doubt but that the Colonel would by that time have quitted Brian|&ccedil;on; and I would not venture to a&s;k a que&s;tion relative to him, le&s;t it might lead her to &s;u&s;pect my thoughts: &s;he however talked of him ince&s;&s;antly; &s;aid he was the hand&s;ome&s;t, and mo&s;t agree|able gentleman &s;he had ever &s;een; told me he had invited her mother and her to &s;upper, and behaved to them as if they were prince&s;&s;es; and added &s;he was glad he did not live in that country, as &s;he feared another interview might en|gage too much of her affections. She rattled away in this manner, till I was &s;ummoned to attend my aunt, and then made me repeat my promi&s;e of going to
<PB N="208" REF="222">
her the moment the old lady &s;hould re|tire to re&s;t.</P>
<P>My aunt was, if po&s;&s;ible, more pee|vi&s;h than u&s;ual that whole day, or at lea&s;t her ill temper had a more than com|mon effect upon my &s;pirits&mdash;I longed for the evening to be relea&s;ed from her tyranny, and to be indulged with the liberty of pouring forth my little &s;or|rows in the bo&s;om of my faithful Nan|nette.</P>
<P>The moment that my aunt had di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed me from her chamber, I flew to my appointment, without waiting to alter my dre&s;s, which was a perfect de&s;|habille, and found Nannette in the ar|bour, adorned with every little orna|ment that &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. My
<PB N="209" REF="223">
thoughts were too much affected with the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of my own &s;ituation, to make reflections on the gaiety of her appearance.</P>
<P>I &s;eated my&s;elf by her, leaned my head upon her bo&s;om, and, with a pro|fu&s;ion of tears, told her I was no longer able to bear the mi&s;ery I &s;uffered from my aunt's &s;everity.&mdash;She &s;miled, and, as I thought, with an air of triumph, told me that I might put an end to my mis|fortunes, as &s;oon as I plea&s;ed, for that the Colonel had a&s;&s;ured her he had vi&s;it|ed all the courts in Europe, and had never &s;een any thing half &s;o beautiful, as either &s;he, or I.&mdash;That for her part &s;he was re&s;olved to try her fortune in the world, forthwith, and not &s;tay moping at Brian&ccedil;on till &s;he grew old and ugly;
<PB N="210" REF="224">
and that if I would accompany her, &s;he did not at all doubt of our &s;ucce&s;s; that I might hope to marry &s;ome reigning prince, and that &s;he might at lea&s;t ex|pect to be mi&s;tre&s;s of a dukedom.</P>
<P>I was both &s;hocked, and &s;urpri&s;ed, at hearing my friend talk in this extrava|gant and unu&s;ual &s;tile; but before I could expre&s;s my &s;entiments, Colonel Walter came into the arbour, dre&s;&s;ed as if he had been going to court on a gala day&mdash;I confe&s;s I was &s;truck, nay daz|zled, with his appearance&mdash;from the time of my leaving Turin, I had never &s;een any man finely or elegantly dre&s;&s;ed, before: I now quickly perceived the ad|vantages that Nannette received from being decked out, and blu&s;hed at the inferiority of my own appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="225">Every human creature has, I believe, &s;ome &s;parks of vanity in their nature, and this was the fatal moment when mine were fir&s;t kindled: a de&s;ire of out|&s;hining Nannette, who had a good deal di&s;gu&s;ted me, took immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my thoughts, and my countenance was, upon the in&s;tant, lighted up with &s;miles.&mdash;I have not a doubt but Colonel Walter &s;aw through the thin veil that co|vered the &s;entiments of a creature &s;o young and artle&s;s as I was then; he at lea&s;t indulged my weakne&s;s, even beyond my wi&s;hes, by intirely devoting his whole attention to me, and totally neglecting my companion.</P>
<P>Olivia here broke off her narrative, to apologize for entering into &s;uch minute circum&s;tances, which &s;he &s;aid was meant
<PB N="212" REF="226">
to convince me of her &s;incerity, as &s;he was very certain that her weakne&s;s and innocence were the ground works of her ruin&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But, alas! (exclaimed &s;he,) is there not indulgence and compa&s;&s;ion due to uneducated uninformed fifteen!"</Q></P>
<P>I told her that her entering into tho&s;e little traits of character, tho&s;e fine, tho&s;e delicate touches, marked the ma&s;ter's hand, and were a convincing proof of the goodne&s;s, both of her head and heart. She complimented me on my candor, and returned to her &s;tory.</P>
<P>There had been the mo&s;t elegant re|pa&s;t provided, that Brian&ccedil;on could af|ford; Nannette, and her mother, the Colonel and I, were all the party; but I was the idol to whom all the incen&s;e was offered. The good woman of the
<PB N="213" REF="227">
hou&s;e took the <HI>ton</HI> from her gue&s;t, extol|led my beauty and my accompli&s;hments, as extravagantly, though not &s;o agreeably, as he.&mdash;Nannette alone was &s;ilent&mdash;In &s;hort, I became intoxicated with flattery; and when the time of our parting drew near, I &s;ecretly lamented at the &s;ame idea which had given me &s;o much &s;atis|faction, the preceding night&mdash;that I &s;hould &s;ee Colonel Walter no more!</P>
<P>The Colonel in&s;i&s;ted on attending me home, and had ordered his chai&s;e to convey me to my aunt's&mdash;But though my vanity was flattered with this mark of attention, I dared not indulge it with &s;uch an eclat; however, I &s;aid I would permit him to walk home with me, provided Nannette would accom|pany us&mdash;She &s;ullenly refu&s;ed&mdash;I had

then no choice, and the Colonel and I &s;et out together.</P>
<P>When we were about to &s;eparate, I wi&s;hed him a good night, and a plea&s;ant journey&mdash;He threw him&s;elf at my feet, caught hold of my hand, &s;wore I was the &s;overeign arbitre&s;s of his fate, and that he would never leave Brian&ccedil;on, till he had obtained my hand, and heart; but that if I cruelly refu&s;ed to accept his love, he would put him&s;elf to death, that in&s;tant, before me.</P>
<P>Child as I was, his tran&s;ports terrified me; I was al&s;o alarmed le&s;t any of my aunt's &s;ervants &s;hould &s;ee him, &s;o I pro|mi&s;ed, if he would then retire, to meet him, the next evening, at the inn.&mdash;He made a merit of a&s;&s;enting to &s;o
<PB N="215" REF="229">
long an ab&s;ence, and after a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ion, and as many more tender adieus, he left me plunged in &s;uch a fatal, yet plea&s;ing delirium, as youth and experience only, can feel. What an infidel &s;hould I have thought the per&s;on who had at that mo|ment warned me to di&s;credit the &s;in|cerity of his profe&s;&s;ion! The night pa&s;|&s;ed away, without &s;leep, yet I thought it &s;hort, and aro&s;e, next morning, even with unu&s;ual vivacity&mdash;My aunt's ill temper was no longer di&s;agreeable to me, my &s;pirits were perfectly harmonized, all was peace within, and chearfulne&s;s without&mdash;Towards evening I began to think that time lagged heavily in its cour&s;e, and wi&s;hed for the &s;etting of the &s;un, as much as a benighted traveller for its ri&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="230">At length the welcome night arrived, and &s;et me free from my re&s;traint; I ran to my toilet to endeavour to adorn the few graces that nature had lent me.&mdash;In vain&mdash;confu&s;ion interrupted my efforts, and ha&s;te prevented my di&s;patch, &s;o that, in a kind of de&s;pair, I threw a&s;ide my few ornaments, &s;natched up a little &s;traw hat, and &s;et out on my adven|tures, in the &s;ame carele&s;s de&s;habille I had appeared the night before.</P>
<P>The moment I had got out of the view of my aunt's hou&s;e, I was met by the Colonel, who received me with an exta&s;y, that I believe was then &s;incere; we pur&s;ued our way to the arbour, where he had fir&s;t &s;een me&mdash;On my not finding Nannette there, I endeavoured to quit him and go in pur&s;uit of her, but he
<PB N="217" REF="231">
held my hand, and entreated me to &s;tay till he had revealed a &s;ecret to me, which was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to us both.&mdash;He then a&s;&s;ured me that Nan|nette was not my friend, and reque&s;ted that I would not intru&s;t her with the di&s;|covery he had made of his pa&s;&s;ion to me, for that he feared &s;he would betray the &s;ecret to my aunt, and by that means de|prive him of more than life, the happi|ne&s;s of &s;eeing me; but that if I would be a little upon my guard, &s;he might &s;uppo&s;e his attachment to be nothing more than common galantry, which might, po&s;&s;ibly, quiet the jealou&s;y &s;he &s;eemed already to have conceived about it.</P>
<P>I was &s;hocked at the idea of deceiv|ing or &s;u&s;pecting my friend, yet the
<PB N="218" REF="232">
gloom and di&s;&s;atisfaction that appeared in her behaviour, the night before, made me too readily fall into this &s;nare; nay, I joined in the deceit again&s;t my&s;elf, by entreating that he would be more atten|tive to her, and le&s;s particular to me, on the pre&s;ent interview. My motive for this reque&s;t, I &s;olemnly declare, was rather to prevent her being mortified, as I &s;aw &s;he had been before, than to re|move any &s;u&s;picion &s;he might have en|tertained of me&mdash;For as I had perfectly acquie&s;ced in the Colonel's honour and integrity, as well as my own innocence, I had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of any ill con&s;equence, in &s;uch a compliance.&mdash;Thus did this artful man disjoin me from the only per&s;on who was likely to &s;ee through his de&s;igns, and could have an intere&s;t in preventing my ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="233">After this di&s;cour&s;e, and abundance of prote&s;tations of the tendere&s;t affection, we joined Nannette, and the Colonel left us for &s;ome time together, to try, as I pre&s;ume, the &s;trength of his power over me.&mdash;Nannette was all gayety, and &s;hewed me abundance of pre&s;ents that &s;he had received from the Colonel. My heart reproached me for concealing its &s;entiments from her, but my promi&s;e to my lover had tied my tongue, and the weakne&s;s and vanity of her conduct left me le&s;s rea&s;on to regret the mortification &s;he mu&s;t feel, when &s;he &s;hould know that he was &s;eriou&s;ly attached to me.</P>
<P>This evening pa&s;&s;ed away le&s;s plea|&s;antly than the former&mdash;Nannette a&s;&s;um|ed a &s;uperiority over me, in &s;en&s;e and judgment; but attempted to &s;often her
<PB N="220" REF="234">
&s;elf-&s;ufficience, by hinting at the differ|ence of our years, and experience; and though this &s;alvo did not render her be|haviour le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting, it deprived me of the power of re&s;enting it, and I retir|ed home convinced that there were two pa&s;&s;ions awakened in my mind, that I had never felt before, love, and hatred.</P>
<P>Nannette and the colonel accompanied me home&mdash;At parting, he put a little billet into my hand, which I could not refu&s;e to accept, without letting her know that it had been offered. I was even then become the &s;lave, the abject &s;lave, of love, and feared to offend my future tyrant! The billet contained no|thing more than a repetition of pa&s;&s;ion|ate and tender expre&s;&s;ions, with the warme&s;t acknowledgments for the at|tention
<PB N="221" REF="235">
I had &s;hewn to his reque&s;t, by the prudence and propriety of my con|duct, and the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties to favour him with my company, the next evening.</P>
<P>I retired to bed, and I hoped to re&s;t, but &s;leep was vani&s;hed, and with it the charming delirium that had kept me waking the foregoing night&mdash;Short was the road that I had travelled in the flowery path of plea&s;ure, yet I already found it &s;trewed with thorns! I trembled at the danger of treading it alone, and lamented more piou&s;ly then, than ever, the lo&s;s of my dear mother, to whom I might have confided both my hopes and fears, upon this hazardous adventure.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="236">The u&s;ual hour of my ri&s;ing arrived, and found my eyes unclo&s;ed, and my thoughts un&s;ettled; I had neither &s;lept, nor determined on any &s;cheme, for my future conduct; and when my maid came into my chamber, I &s;tept out of bed, bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, and &s;aid &s;oftly to my&s;elf, I will not &s;ee the Colonel&mdash;at lea&s;t, this day.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered this determination as an amazing effort of re&s;olution, and fan|cied I had gained a complete victory over my infant pa&s;&s;ion. The anxiety of my mind, with lo&s;s of re&s;t, had brought on a &s;light degree of fever; and the mo|ment I quitted my aunt's chamber, I retired to my own, threw my&s;elf on the bed, and de&s;ired my maid to leave me.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="237">The poor girl, who loved me tender|ly, was alarmed at my &s;ituation, and ran directly to Nannette, to tell her I was ill, and to beg &s;he would come to me&mdash;She told her &s;he was at that time &s;o particularly engaged, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible for her to &s;tir abroad, but that &s;he would certainly &s;ee me, &s;ome time in the evening.</P>
<P>I knew nothing of this tran&s;action; and after having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in a di&s;agreeable &s;tate of re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, the agi|tation of my mind &s;ub&s;ided, and I fell a&s;leep.&mdash;Some time after I was awaked by a light at my bed-&s;ide, and on open|ing my eyes I perceived Nannette, and Colonel Walter, di&s;gui&s;ed in womens cloaths, &s;tanding by me; the confu&s;ion which I felt, both from my &s;ituation,
<PB N="224" REF="238">
and his, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;He gazed upon me, with &s;uch a look of ardent tenderne&s;s, as covered me with blu&s;hes. I turned my eyes away, begged they would withdraw into another room, and promi&s;ed them that as &s;oon as I had ren|dered my appearance decent, I would wait on them.</P>
<P>Nannette bur&s;t into a loud laugh, at what &s;he called my affected delicacy; &s;aid &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed every body was &s;ome|times undre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he did not &s;ee any occa&s;ion for making a difficulty about &s;uch trifles.&mdash;The boldne&s;s of her manner while &s;he &s;poke, increa&s;ed my di&s;tre&s;s, and completed the di&s;like I had began to have conceived for her&mdash;The Colonel appeared infinitely more mode&s;t, in his deportment, and on his making a &s;ign
<PB N="225" REF="239">
to her to leave the chamber, they both withdrew.</P>
<P>The hurry of &s;pirits which this unex|pected vi&s;it had occa&s;ioned, was increa&s;|ed by my apprehen&s;ions that &s;ome of the &s;ervants might detect the Colonel un|der his di&s;gui&s;e; and though I knew they all loved and pitied me, yet I had been taught in my infancy, to dread the putting my&s;elf in the power of a &s;ervant, and never to let them know a circum|&s;tance which I wi&s;hed &s;hould be kept &s;ecret.</P>
<P>The moment that I entered the room where my gue&s;ts were, I entreated them to leave me, and mentioned my rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing them gone.&mdash;Nannette again made a je&s;t of my &s;cruples, but the Co|lonel
<PB N="226" REF="240">
treated them more &s;eriou&s;ly, and a&s;ked my pardon for having brought me into any difficulty or di&s;tre&s;s, by his in|di&s;cretion, but pleaded both his, and Nan|nette's anxiety for my health; and in&s;i&s;t|ed on my returning with them to the inn, &s;ince he was certain, from my appear|ance, that I had not any complaint to prevent me.&mdash;</P>
<P>But not to detain you, Madam, longer, with &s;uch tedious circum&s;tances, I, half reluctantly, complied with his entreaties, and for about three weeks longer, we &s;pent every evening together, almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I had by this time lo&s;t all affection and e&s;teem for Nannette, and had now no confidante or friend, on earth, to whom
<PB N="227" REF="241">
I could di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of my heart, but the &s;ingle per&s;on in the world from whom I &s;hould mo&s;t carefully have con|cealed them.</P>
<P>When he had become quite certain of his empire over my affections, he pro|po&s;ed my quitting Brian&ccedil;on, with him&mdash;he &s;aid my aunt was too old and perver&s;e to be con&s;ulted, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; that he neither wanted nor de&s;ired any trea|&s;ure but my&s;elf, for that all other con|&s;iderations were below his attention&mdash;he added, that his pa&s;&s;ion for me had detain|ed him &s;o long, at Brian&ccedil;on, that he was in danger of forfeiting his commi&s;&s;ion, and his honour; that if I loved him, I ought not to he&s;itate about putting my|&s;elf under his protection; that our intere&s;ts were now become one, and that he would

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Lady BARTON to Mi&s;s CLEVELAND.</HEAD>
<P>TAKE notice, my dear Fanny, that I am not u&s;ed to narrative writing; you mu&s;t, therefore, make allowances for me, and excu&s;e my being &s;ometimes too circum&s;tantial, and at others, too dif|fu&s;e.&mdash;I can only &s;ay that my tran&s;lation is, what all others pretend to be, a faith|ful one.</P>
<P>Perhaps it is &s;o much the wor&s;e, for that rea&s;on, for while I am endeavouring to convey the minute&s;t circum&s;tances to you, the elegance of expre&s;&s;ion which gave them con&s;equence, in the original, is lo&s;t.&mdash;But no matter for the manner of recital&mdash;if the &s;tory intere&s;ts and affects you as much in the reading, as it does
<PB N="230" REF="244">
me in the writing, I &s;hall be &s;atisfied with my own performance.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fair Olivia had regain|ed her compo&s;ure, &s;he proceeded thus&mdash;Weak, young, and infatuated with pa&s;|&s;ion, as I was, the Colonel's propo&s;al of flying with him, without marriage, alarm|ed me, and awakened all the &s;entiments of delicacy, which are inherent to an innocent and virtuous mind; yet that very delicacy prevented my having re&s;o|lution to expre&s;s my thoughts upon that occa&s;ion&mdash;I feared to injure his honour, by &s;eeming to doubt it.&mdash;I therefore re|mained, for &s;ome time, &s;ilent upon this mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject&mdash;He repeated his entreaties, and pre&s;&s;ed me to determine.</P>
<P>I replied, that I would con&s;ult my con|fe&s;&s;or. He had &s;een the various workings
<PB N="231" REF="245">
of my mind, and was prepared to evade all my &s;cruples&mdash;He objected in&s;tantly to my propo&s;al, by urging that a prie&s;t would oppo&s;e my marrying an heretic, and endeavour to prevent it, by acquaint|ing my aunt; but told me he had a par|ticular friend, a clergyman, at Embrun, who would make no difficulty of uniting us together.&mdash;Thus did this artful man lull all my doubts to re&s;t, and &s;oothe my unwary mind into a perfect dependance upon his honour, fidelity, and love.</P>
<P>The night following was fixed for our departure, and in an evil and inau&s;picious hour, I ventured on a world unknown, with the mo&s;t inhuman and ungenerous of his &s;ex, for my conductor&mdash;I had per|haps as little to regret at leaving Brian|&ccedil;on, as any young creature who ever
<PB N="232" REF="246">
took &s;o ra&s;h and unadvi&s;ed a &s;tep&mdash;I wounded not the heart of a fond parent! nor drew a pitying tear from any friend|ly eye! I had no &s;i&s;ter, on whom my di&s;|grace might be reflected! nor a brother, who&s;e tenderne&s;s might lament, or ho|nour have re&s;ented my mi&s;conduct!&mdash;I &s;tood, as it were, alone in the univer&s;e; was dear to no one, but the loved object under who&s;e protection I now had placed my&s;elf, and in whom all the affections of my heart were centered!</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding this very peculiar &s;ituation, my heart trembled, and my eyes overflowed, when I got into the chai&s;e, and every league that we travel|ed, the dejection of my &s;pirits increa&s;ed&mdash;For &s;ome time the Colonel endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate my melancholy, by the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="233" REF="247">
tenderne&s;s, and I affected to appear more chearful, in compliment to his at|tention&mdash;but he &s;oon rou&s;ed my languor into re&s;entment, by taking &s;ome unwar|rantable liberties, which, when he found I would not &s;uffer, he attempted to ex|cu&s;e, by &s;aying that he had already con&s;i|dered me as his wife.</P>
<P>The moment we arrived at Embrun, he left me in the inn, to go, as he &s;aid, in pur&s;uit of his friend, the clergyman&mdash;He returned, in about an hour, with a per&s;on to perform the ceremony; and we were married directly, but without any other witne&s;s; for I had thrown my&s;elf out of a &s;ituation to pre&s;cribe terms, and mu&s;t therefore have compounded for ha|ving my own &s;cruples &s;atisfied, by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my being his wife, leaving
<PB N="234" REF="248">
the opinion of the world to its own cha|rity about me.</P>
<P>We remained two days at Embrun, and then &s;et out for Mar&s;eilles; during our long journey, my hu&s;band told me that he had &s;ome rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to change his name; and that in compliment to my chri&s;tian one he would be called Olivet.&mdash;I readily acquie&s;ced in what|ever he thought proper, without attempt|ing to enquire into the motives of his conduct. We took a hou&s;e at Mar|&s;eilles, and lived for four months, in the utmo&s;t retirement, and the mo&s;t per|fect happine&s;s together&mdash;I never &s;tirred out, but to church, or to take the air with my hu&s;band; every wi&s;h of my fond heart was accompli&s;hed, and I &s;ecretly rejoiced that he no longer talked
<PB N="235" REF="249">
of joining his regiment, or returning to his native country.</P>
<P>About that time his temper and man|ners began to alter; he was frequently &s;ullen, and gloomy; and if I attempted to enquire into the cau&s;e of this change, he would an&s;wer, Thou art! and com|mand me to leave him&mdash;I obeyed, and u&s;ed to retire to my chamber, and pa&s;s whole days and nights, in tears.&mdash;But whenever he conde&s;cended to &s;peak to me with chearfulne&s;s, I in&s;tantly forgot his pa&s;t unkindne&s;s, and vainly flattered my&s;elf that it would return no more.</P>
<P>At length, with &s;ome appearance of tenderne&s;s in his manner, he told me that he was under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of leaving me, for a few months, as my
<PB N="236" REF="250">
&s;ituation would not admit of my travel|ling with him, from my being far advan|ced in my pregnancy of Olivia; but that he would certainly come back to me, by the time I &s;hould be recovered from my lying-in, and take me with him to Ire|land, where his e&s;tate lay.</P>
<P>All that I had ever &s;uffered in my life, &s;eemed &s;light, to the mi&s;ery of parting with him; I knelt, I wept, and implor|ed him not to abandon me, under &s;uch circum&s;tances! He was unmoved by my tears, and entreaties; and in a few days afterwards quitted Mar&s;eilles, without even bidding me adieu.&mdash;The grief I felt from this &s;eparation, would I hoped have terminated my life; and I fear I &s;hould have been tempted to have &s;hort|ened the date of my wretched exi&s;tence,
<PB N="237" REF="251">
had not the tenderne&s;s which I felt even for my unborn babe, re&s;trained my hand from the too frequent effects of de&s;pair. My &s;ituation was certainly deplorable, and I then thought that my mi&s;ery could not admit of addition&mdash;I have been &s;ince but too &s;trongly convinced that there are numberle&s;s gradations in wretched|ne&s;s, and that I was then but entering on my novitiate.</P>
<P>I was &s;o totally ab&s;orbed in &s;orrow at being for&s;aken by an hu&s;band, whom, notwith&s;tanding his unkindne&s;s, I both re&s;pected and loved, that the common concerns of life never occurred to me, till my maid came to a&s;k me for money, to &s;upport my family, which con&s;i&s;ted of two maids, and a man &s;ervant. I &s;tarted, as from a dream, and in an ago|ny

<P>Here again the fair mourner's tears interrupted her recital, and mu&s;t al&s;o put a &s;top to my tran&s;lation, for the pre|&s;ent. I wi&s;h extremely that I had fini&s;h|ed the ta&s;k I have undertaken; for the &s;ympathy between us is &s;o &s;trong, that I feel my health wa&s;ting as her tale pro|ceeds.

<P>MY dear Fanny, I am now &s;itting down to conclude, I hope, the &s;ufferings of my fair Narrator, which I &s;hall endeavour to do without any further interruption; for though the li&s;tening to her &s;tory, had a great deal of what I deem <HI>the luxury of woe</HI> in it, I fear that this delicate &s;en&s;ation may have evaporated, from the frequent breaks in the recital, as much as the original &s;pirit has, in my tran&s;lation&mdash;but at at all hazards, I will now proceed.</P>
<P>On peru&s;ing this &s;hocking and &s;urpri&s;|ing manu&s;cript, continued Mrs. Wal|ter,
<PB N="242" REF="256">
my head turned round, and I had ju&s;t pre&s;ence of mind &s;ufficient to convey it into my pocket, before I dropt upon the floor. The &s;ervants heard me fall, and came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Happy would it have been for me, if they had &s;pared their cruel officiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;uf|fered me to have expired at that mo|ment!</P>
<P>My di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;pondency, upon this occa&s;ion, may appear unaccountable, perhaps, to others. An hu&s;band's leav|ing his wife, &s;ometimes, upon &s;everal occa&s;ions of bu&s;ine&s;s, was not &s;o uncom|mon a ca&s;e as to have alarmed me.&mdash;But there is a &s;ort of prae&s;entiment, in the mind, which often forebodes approach|ing ills; philo&s;ophy mu&s;t here be at a &s;tand. This circum&s;tance cannot be ac|counted
<PB N="243" REF="257">
for from nature, as the pre&s;ent &s;ituation may have no &s;en&s;ible connec|tion with the future events; nor can &s;uch an effect be imputed to Providence nei|ther, without the impiety of &s;uppo&s;ing it capable of rendering us wretched, be|fore our time, by giving us a hint of misfortunes to come, without &s;upplying us with the means of avoiding them.</P>

This circum&s;tance too, &s;upplied me with a &s;trong rea&s;on, al&s;o, to &s;u&s;pect

that in reality I had no legal title to that claim, as the unknown per&s;on who had &s;o clande&s;tinely performed the ceremo|ny, might not probably have been pro|perly qualified, by the orders of any church, to have officiated in the mar|riage rites.</P>
<P>It was, perhaps, no &s;mall aggravation to my misfortunes, to reflect, that had not my own indi&s;cretion aided his di&s;ho|nour, I &s;hould not now have been &s;o totally abandoned, unju&s;tified, unfriended, and un&s;u&s;tained, to the &s;port of fortune, to the mercy of a malignant, cen&s;orious, and unpitying world!</P>
<P>Some days after this event, I was ly|ing on my bed, in a &s;tate of &s;tupid di&s;|traction, when the &s;udden &s;topping of a
<PB N="245" REF="259">
chai&s;e at my door, rou&s;ed me from my lethargy&mdash;I leaped off the bed, and flew down &s;tairs, crying out, he is returned, my life, my love, my hu&s;band!&mdash;But judge of my a&s;toni&s;hment, madam, when I &s;aw Nannette enter the door&mdash;Her face was thin, and pale, but &s;he appear|ed farther advanced in her pregnancy, than I, and &s;eemed, from the expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, to be, at that in&s;tant, in the pangs of labour.</P>
<P>She acco&s;ted me with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;e, called me vile, deceitful wretch! &s;aid I had &s;educed her hu&s;band from her, that &s;he was come to claim him, and to cover me with the infamy I de&s;erved; alter|nately called for her dear Colonel Wal|ter, and implored a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;ave her's, and her infant's life.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="260">Amid&s;t the variety of pa&s;&s;ions, which in tho&s;e moments preyed upon my wretched heart, compa&s;&s;ion was the &s;trong|e&s;t! I had her immediately conveyed to my chamber, and placed in my own bed; I &s;ent for the bed a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be had, and in a few hours &s;he was deliver|ed of a &s;on, who lived but three days. The agitations of her mind brought on a violent fever, but even in her ravings &s;he continued to accu&s;e me as the &s;ole cau&s;e of all her &s;ufferings, and uttered the mo&s;t vehement imprecations again&s;t me.</P>
<P>From the moment of Nannette's arri|val, I could perceive that my &s;ervants treated me with le&s;s re&s;pect than u&s;ual; they doubtle&s;s believed her &s;tory, and thought that my receiving her into my
<PB N="247" REF="261">
hou&s;e, was at once a proof both of my guilt and fear.&mdash;The phy&s;ician and apothecary who attended her, divulged the tale abroad, and I was looked upon by the whole city of Mar&s;eilles, as one of the mo&s;t abandoned wretches.</P>
<P>I know nothing that creates &s;uch an irk&s;ome &s;en&s;ation in the mind, as imput|ed guilt; but the very delicacy that makes us feel it mo&s;t, &s;erves to re&s;train us from entering into a vindication; as this would be to admit it po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, it might be true.&mdash;Under &s;uch a difficulty I then laboured, and this nicety, &s;upported by the natural courage of inno|cence, inclined me rather to acquie&s;ce in the cen&s;ure, than engage in &s;o public a ju&s;tification of my&s;elf, as this unhappy woman's charge again&s;t me &s;eemed to re|quire;
<PB N="248" REF="262">
and &s;he was not her&s;elf, at that time, in a fit condition, either of mind or body, to have li&s;tened to my defence.</P>
<P>Nannette's-delirium continued about fifteen days, during which time the mi&s;er|able pittance that Colonel Walter had left me, was exhau&s;ted, and I was &s;eized with the pains of labour, without being mi&s;|tre&s;s of a &s;ingle livre, or credit in the place. Death was, at that time, the &s;u|preme object of my wi&s;hes; yet in regard to my dear babe, that now approached the light, I &s;ent for my confe&s;&s;or, re|lated to him every circum&s;tance that I have repeated to you, implored his pro|tection for the unborn innocent, and put a &s;hagreen ca&s;e which contained the por|traits of both my parents, with &s;ome jewels, into his hands, which had been
<PB N="249" REF="263">
bequeathed me by my dear mother, on her death bed, and which I had ever &s;ince pre&s;erved as a relic, with the mo&s;t pure devotion.</P>
<P>Truth generally affords conviction to an ingenuous mind; the good father heard my &s;tory, believed it, pitied my di&s;tre&s;s, and gave me every con&s;olation that my wretched &s;tate could admit of, by admini&s;tering the rites of the church, and a&s;&s;uring me, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner, that he would take the utmo&s;t care of my child, in ca&s;e it &s;hould &s;urvive its unhappy mother. I likewi&s;e recommend|ed Nannette to his humanity&mdash;He pro|mi&s;ed that while &s;he remained ill, all her wants &s;hould be &s;upplied; and if &s;he re|covered, he would furni&s;h her with the means of returning home again to her mother.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="264">Peace once more took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t, and a thorough re&s;ignation to the will of Heaven triumphed for a while over that di&s;tracting inquietude, which had well nigh de&s;troyed both my mind and body&mdash;But the arrow of incurable affliction was &s;till lodged in my heart, and the temporary calm that I then enjoyed, was occa&s;ioned rather by my weakne&s;s than my &s;trength.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed Heaven that I was &s;oon and &s;afely delivered of my beloved Olivia; and from the moment of her birth, all &s;elfi&s;h apprehen&s;ions vani&s;hed; I no longer felt a pang, but for her; and never cea&s;ed lamenting her being involved in the mi&s;eries of her mother! Though doating on her as I did, I a thou&s;and times wi&s;hed &s;he had been born of any other parent!
<PB N="251" REF="265">
and yet am certain I would not have part|ed with her to a queen.</P>
<P>In about ten days after I was brought to bed, the good father, who had &s;upplied me with every nece&s;&s;ary, and vi&s;ited me con&s;tantly, came into my chamber, with an unu&s;ual vivacity in his looks&mdash;Be of good cheer, Madam, &s;aid he; Pro|vidence never for&s;akes the virtuous and patient &s;ufferer&mdash;Heaven has been plea&s;|ed, through my weak endeavours, to rai&s;e you up a friend, who is at once in|clined and capable of relieving you from your di&s;tre&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a certain &s;upply for your future competence.&mdash;Madame de Fribourg will be here in a few minutes, and is coming to take you under her roof and protection; but, before it is po&s;&s;ible for you to remove
<PB N="252" REF="266">
there, I will inform you how this in&s;tance of good fortune has been brought about, and furni&s;h you with &s;ome in&s;tructions, that may conduce towards rendering you agreeable to your patrone&s;s.&mdash;But while he was yet &s;peaking, the marchione&s;s de Fribourg entered, and interrupted him.</P>
<P>I have already told you, that I had lodged Nannette, in my own chamber, and was of cour&s;e obliged to lye-in, in my maid's room&mdash;The fir&s;t words the Marchione&s;s uttered, were, Heavens! what a place for the child of my friend! my dear madame d'Alemberg! She &s;tept forward and embraced me, then rai&s;ed her gla&s;s to her eye, and &s;urveyed me with the mo&s;t critical and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing at|tention; I was &s;o extremely confu&s;ed, both by the &s;uddenne&s;s and manner of her
<PB N="253" REF="267">
entering and addre&s;s, that I could nei|ther &s;peak nor move.</P>
<P>From the death of that dear mother &s;he mentioned, I had never &s;een a woman that was capable of in&s;piring me with re|&s;pect, or awe, before&mdash;her appearance commanded both&mdash;A &s;udden gu&s;h of tears relieved me for a moment, and &s;eemed to &s;often the <HI>farouche demeanour</HI> of my future benefactre&s;s.&mdash;She quickly made an apology for having mentioned my mother, &s;eated her&s;elf by me, laid a&s;ide her gla&s;s, and took my hand with infi|nite grace, but no &s;oftne&s;s.</P>
<P>The marchione&s;s was about fifty years old, &s;he was uncommonly tall, had been remarkably hand&s;ome, her eyes large, black, and piercing; but the whole con|tour
<PB N="254" REF="268">
of her countenance was rather hard than plea&s;ing&mdash;there was an air of <HI>fiert&eacute;</HI> expre&s;&s;ed throughout her whole appear|ance, that inclined you, at fir&s;t &s;ight, ra|ther to fear than love her.</P>
<P>She told me, that my confe&s;&s;or, who was al&s;o her's, had informed her of my di&s;tre&s;s, but that chance had brought her acquainted with my being the daugh|ter of her friend; that, as &s;uch, I might depend on her good offices, and regard: and added, that &s;he hoped I &s;hould be ready to &s;et out with her, in a few days, for Paris, where &s;he was then going; and that &s;he would order her woman to pro|vide a proper nur&s;e to leave my child with.</P>
<P>The idea of parting with my daughter, &s;hocked me extremely&mdash;I fell at her feet,
<PB N="255" REF="269">
and as if &s;he had been the arbitre&s;s of my fate, implored her not to divide me from my child! &s;aid that this infant was now the only ble&s;&s;ing I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in life, and that nothing but death, or her happine&s;s, &s;hould ever part us.</P>
<P>She gazed at me with a mixture of &s;urpri&s;e and contempt, and &s;aid, that if Pere Guillaume had informed her I was &s;uch a pretty &s;impleton, &s;he would have &s;aved me and her&s;elf the trouble of a vi|&s;it; but that &s;he believed there was &s;ome|thing contagious in folly, &s;ince &s;he found her&s;elf inclined to comply with my ab|&s;urd reque&s;t, though &s;he dete&s;ted chil|dren; but that her hotel at Paris being large enough to prevent her hearing it &s;quall, I might bring the brat with me, provided I did not in&s;i&s;t on her being plagued with it, during our journey.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="270">I was tran&s;ported with even this un|couth and forced permi&s;&s;ion; I ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and bathed it with my tears; told her &s;he had rendered me extremely happy, and that I would endeavour to de&s;erve her indulgence, by every mark of gratitude and attention in my power. She &s;eemed plea&s;ed, and &s;omewhat af|fected; and at quitting me, &s;he gave me a pur&s;e of fifty Louis-d'ors, bid me pre|pare for my journey, by that day &s;en|night; &s;aid &s;he would not de&s;ire me to come to her hou&s;e, at Mar&s;eilles, be|cau&s;e &s;he meant to &s;urpri&s;e her hu&s;band, by finding me in her &s;uite, without his knowlege, and de&s;ired that I might &s;till retain the name of d'Olivet.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t &s;udden tran&s;ition I had ever experienced, from &s;orrow to
<PB N="257" REF="271">
joy; and tho' I could not po&s;&s;ibly know what &s;ort of &s;tate I was going to enter into, yet I thought any change mu&s;t be for the better&mdash;It was al&s;o the fir&s;t time I had ever had any thing like bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act in my life; and the having it in my power to di&s;charge my debts and &s;ervants, compo&s;ed my mind into a &s;tate of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing tranquility imagin|able.&mdash;Nannette, however, remained &s;till a weight upon my &s;pirits, in addition to that misfortune that then did, and ever will oppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after the marchione&s;s had left me, the good father Guillaume re|turned; he brought with him the &s;hagreen ca&s;e, which I had intru&s;ted him with, the contents untouched, except a dia|mond ring which he had been obliged to
<PB N="258" REF="272">
di&s;po&s;e of, to an&s;wer the expences of my family; and delivered me twelve Louis d'ors, the remainder of thirty he had &s;old it for.&mdash;The &s;ight of my dear parent's pictures affected me extremely; I ki&s;&s;ed and bathed them with my tears, and mo&s;t piou&s;ly thanked my good pa|trone&s;s in my heart, for this article of her bounty, more than all the re&s;t, that &s;he had &s;aved me from the mi&s;ery of parting with tho&s;e dear remains.</P>
<P>Father Guillaume told me that he had related my &s;tory to madame de Fribourg, without mentioning who I was, and &s;hewed her the jewels, in hopes that &s;he would purcha&s;e them, which &s;he refu&s;ed; but the moment &s;he beheld the portraits, &s;he &s;natched up one of them, exclaiming with &s;urprize and joy, this, this is&mdash;was&mdash;
<PB N="259" REF="273">
my near relation, and my deare&s;t friend, Olivia d'Alemberg! upon which he ac|quainted her with my name and family; and &s;he promi&s;ed on the in&s;tant to take care of me, but in&s;i&s;ted on his not in|forming me that &s;he had acknowledged any manner of affinity between us.</P>
<P>He then gave me the marchione&s;s's character and hi&s;tory, in a few words.&mdash;Pride, vanity, an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of admiration, and a fondne&s;s for play, he &s;aid, were her great foibles; but that &s;he was friendly, generous, and humane, when the&s;e virtues did not interfere with her pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;He &s;aid &s;he had been mar|ried young to the marquis de Fribourg, that he had been dead about ten years, and had left her immen&s;ely rich; that &s;he had &s;ince married mon&s;ieur de Lovaine,
<PB N="260" REF="274">
a young &s;oldier of fortune, who treated her very cavalierly, and of whom &s;he was extravagantly fond and jealous&mdash;He told me that he had furni&s;hed me with this little <HI>charte du pa&iuml;s,</HI> in hopes I &s;hould be able to &s;teer my cour&s;e by it, to &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He then informed me that he had written to a friend of his, in Ireland, to inquire after Colonel Walter; but that, as I had not been able to a&s;certain even the name of the province where his for|tune lay, it was po&s;&s;ible, nay probable, from the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of his character, that I might never &s;ee or hear of him again.&mdash;He intreated me, therefore, to &s;trive wholly to forget him, and devote my whole attention to the cultivation of the marchione&s;s's friend&s;hip, and the
<PB N="261" REF="275">
education of my child&mdash;He promi&s;ed to remember me in his prayers, and to fa|vour me with his advice by letter; then took a mo&s;t affectionate leave of me, as he was obliged to quit Mar&s;eilles, for a few days, to perform &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, by command of his &s;uperior.</P>
<P>I had not &s;een Nannette from the time of my being taken ill; but as I knew &s;he was recovering, though &s;lowly, I fancied I was then able to bear an interview with her, and acquaint her with my de&s;ign of quitting Mar&s;eilles: I meant to offer her every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, and take leave of her, I hoped, for life.</P>
<P>I accordingly proceeded to her cham|ber&mdash;but no words can expre&s;s the &s;ur|pri&s;e and horror that affected me, at &s;ee|ing
<PB N="262" REF="276">
her&mdash;Her whole frame was convul&s;ed, and every feature di&s;torted and enlarged. The moment &s;he beheld me, &s;he &s;eemed to acquire new &s;trength, and endeavour|ed to revile me with as much bitter|ne&s;s, as when &s;he arrived fir&s;t at Mar|&s;eilles.</P>
<P>She had, however, no longer the power of rai&s;ing any pa&s;&s;ion in me, but pity&mdash;I &s;aid every thing that was po&s;&s;ible to calm her mind; a&s;&s;ured her I had never knowingly injured her; and that I had certainly been as much, if not more, im|po&s;ed on and deceived, by Colonel Wal|ter, than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I then proceeded to relate, with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s, the Colonel's whole be|haviour, from his fir&s;t meeting, to his
<PB N="263" REF="277">
quitting me, during the recital of which, &s;he wept often; her countenance became more placid and compo&s;ed; and, when I had fini&s;hed my &s;tory, &s;he a&s;ked my pardon, a thou&s;and times, for the injury &s;he had done me, and confe&s;&s;ed I was much more to be pitied than her&s;elf, on account of my youth and inexperience.</P>
<P>She confe&s;&s;ed too, that the formalities of marriage had never pa&s;&s;ed between them; but &s;hewed me a paper he had given her, by which he had engaged to acknowledge her as his wife, at &s;ome fu|ture aera. And with regard to the mark|ed attention which he had &s;hewn to me, he a&s;&s;ured her he meant nothing more by it, than merely to deceive her mother&mdash;and in order to carry on the plot, &s;aid he was obliged to &s;pend a few weeks at
<PB N="264" REF="278">
Embrun, upon a particular bu&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;ired her to hold her&s;elf in readine&s;s to come off to him there, at a minute's warn|ing, on a &s;ummons which he promi&s;ed to &s;end her from thence.</P>
<P>Matters being thus &s;ettled between them, her mind, &s;he &s;aid, was quite at ea&s;e on his departure&mdash;till &s;he heard of my elopement with him, the morning af|ter it happened; which threw her into a &s;tate of di&s;traction, for &s;everal months; but not hearing from him, all that time, and beginning, at la&s;t, to apprehend that her &s;ituation would quickly di&s;cover her mi&s;conduct, and cover her with infamy, &s;he determined to follow him to Embrun; and as &s;he could not &s;uppo&s;e that he had ventured to have entered into firmer en|gagements with me, than he had already
<PB N="265" REF="279">
done with her, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as having a prior right to the title of his wife, and re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert her claim.</P>
<P>She then took a &s;mall &s;um of money from her mother, to whom, at length, &s;he had revealed the &s;ecret, and came off po&s;t to Embrun, as it had been known that we had taken that route; but upon mi&s;&s;ing us there, &s;he had with almo&s;t in|credible difficulty, and after numberle&s;s delays, attended by illne&s;s and fatigue on the way, traced us to Mar&s;eilles, where &s;he acknowledged that &s;he owed her life to my unmerited humanity&mdash;&s;he then poured forth many &s;evere excecrations again&s;t Colonel Walter, &s;aid &s;he would not return to Brian&ccedil;on, but, if &s;he &s;hould recover, would pur&s;ue him all over the world, till &s;he had received &s;atisfaction,
<PB N="266" REF="280">
at lea&s;t in revenge, for his perjured faith and villainy.</P>
<P>She told me that my aunt had not ex|pre&s;&s;ed either rage or &s;urpri&s;e at my going off, but &s;eemed rather to be &s;uf|ficiently con&s;oled for my lo&s;s, by being freed from the expence of my future main|tenance.&mdash;There is a material difference between the belief, and certainty of a fact&mdash;and though I had hitherto &s;up|po&s;ed that her in&s;en&s;ibility might have prevented her from grieving at the im|propriety of my conduct, or the misfor|tunes which might probably attend it, I could not bear to be convinced of my own in&s;ignificance, by her inhumanity&mdash;I felt humbled and mortified, at this account, as if I had received &s;ome fre&s;h injury.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="281">Before I knew any thing of Madame de Fribourg, I had many times thought of returning to Brian&ccedil;on, of throwing my&s;elf at my only &s;urviving parent's feet, and of endeavouring to obtain her pardon, for my offending &s;elf, and her protection for my unoffending child.&mdash;But now the idea vani&s;hed like a dream, and I thought of no other re&s;ource, but the mar|chione&s;s's kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>After having di&s;charged all my little debts, I had about thirteen Louis-d'ors left, and the day before I quitted Mar|&s;eilles, I took leave of Nannette, and pre&s;ented her with ten of them; I begged to hear from her, and left a line recom|mending her to the care of the good Fa|ther Guilaume, and we parted from each
<PB N="268" REF="282">
other with all the tokens and feelings of revived friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>When the Marchione&s;s's equipage &s;top|ped at my door, I was ready to &s;tep into it, and my little girl was con&s;igned to the care of her woman, who travelled in a chai&s;e behind us&mdash;Madame de Fribourg acco&s;ted me with great good-humour, and prai&s;ed my exactne&s;s, in not keeping her waiting. The in&s;tant I opened my lips to reply to her politene&s;s, Mon&s;ieur de Lovain lifted up his eye-lids, which had been clo&s;ed before, and &s;eemed to awake from a profound &s;lumber; he gazed at me with an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ur|pri&s;e in his look, and threw me into as much confu&s;ion as his lady had done on out fir&s;t interview.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="283">From that moment he became lively, and &s;o perfectly polite, and attentive to the Marchione&s;s, that not only &s;he, but I was charmed with his behaviour, and our long journey was rendered perfectly agreeable by the plea&s;ing concord that appeared between, as I then thought, this happy pair.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Paris, the mar|chione&s;s allotted me an apartment, in her hotel, and ordered two of her women to attend particularly on me, and my child; &s;he reque&s;ted that I would get the better of my <HI>air tri&s;te,</HI> and appointed a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter and a dancing-ma&s;ter to in&s;truct and fa&s;hion me.</P>
