<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the favourable reception given to my Abridgement of Roman Hi&s;tory, publi&s;hed &s;ome time &s;ince, &s;everal friends, and others, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s leads them to con&s;ult the wants of the public, have been induced to &s;uppo&s;e, that an Engli&s;h hi&s;tory writ|ten on the &s;ame plan would be accept|able. It was their opinion that we &s;till wanted a work of this kind, where the narrative, though very conci&s;e, is not totally without intere&s;t, and the facts, though crowded, are yet di&s;tinctly &s;een.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of abridging the works of others has hitherto fallen to the lot of very dull men; and the art of blot|ting, which an eminent critic calls the mo&s;t difficult of all others, has been
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
u&s;ually practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who found them&s;elves unable to write. Hence, our abridgements are generally more tedious than the works from which they pre|tend to relieve us, and they have effec|tually embarra&s;&s;ed that road which they laboured to &s;horten.</P>
<P>As the pre&s;ent compiler &s;tarts with &s;uch humble competitors, it will &s;carcely be thought vanity in him if he boa&s;ts him&s;elf their &s;uperior. Of the many abridgements of our own hi&s;tory hither|to publi&s;hed, none &s;eems po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;hare of merit or reputation; &s;ome have been written in dialogue, or merely in the &s;tiffne&s;s of an index, and &s;ome to an|&s;wer the purpo&s;es of a party. A very &s;mall &s;hare of ta&s;te, therefore, was &s;uf|ficient to keep the compiler from the defects of the one, and a very &s;mall &s;hare of philo&s;ophy from the mi&s;repre|&s;entations of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="5">It is not ea&s;y, however, to &s;atisfy the different expectations of mankind in a work of this kind, calculated for every apprehen&s;ion, and on which all are con|&s;equently capable of forming &s;ome judg|ment. Some may &s;ay that it is too long to pa&s;s under the denomination of an abridgement, and others that it is too dry to be admitted as an hi&s;tory; it may be objected that reflection is almo&s;t en|tirely bani&s;hed to make room for facts, and yet that many facts are wholly omit|ted, which might be nece&s;&s;ary to be known.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that all the&s;e ob|jections are partly true; for it is impo&s;|&s;ible in the &s;ame work, at once, to at|tain contrary advantages. The compi|ler who is &s;tinted in room, mu&s;t often &s;acrifice intere&s;t to brevity; and on the other hand, while he endeavours to a|mu&s;e, mu&s;t frequently tran&s;gre&s;s the li|mits to which his plan &s;hould confine him. Thus all &s;uch as de&s;ire only a|mu&s;ement
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
may be di&s;gu&s;ted with his bre|vity, and &s;uch as &s;eek for information may object to his di&s;placing facts for empty de&s;cription.</P>
<P>To attain the greate&s;t number of ad|vantages with the fewe&s;t inconvenien|cies, is all that can be attained in an abridgement, the very name of which implies imperfection. It will be &s;uffi|cient, therefore, to &s;atisfy the writer's wi&s;hes, if the pre&s;ent work be found a plain unaffected narrative of facts, with ju&s;t ornament enough to keep attention awake, and with reflection barely &s;uf|ficient to &s;et the reader upon thinking. Very moderate abilities were equal to &s;uch an undertaking; and it is hoped the performance will &s;atisfy &s;uch as take up books to be informed or amu&s;ed, without much con&s;idering who the wri|ter is, or envying him any &s;ucce&s;s he may have had in a former compilation.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="7">As the pre&s;ent publication is de&s;igned for the benefit of tho&s;e who intend to lay a foundation for future &s;tudy, or de|&s;ire to refre&s;h their memories upon the old, or who think a moderate &s;hare of hi&s;tory &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of life, recour&s;e has been had only to tho&s;e au|thors which are be&s;t known, and tho&s;e facts only have been &s;elected, which are allowed on all hands to be true. Were an epitome of hi&s;tory the field for di&s;|playing erudition, the author could &s;hew that he has read many books which others have neglected, and that he al&s;o could advance many anecdotes which are at pre&s;ent very little known. But it mu&s;t be remembered that all the&s;e mi|nute recoveries could be in&s;erted only to the exclu&s;ion of more material facts, which it would be unpardonable to omit. He foregoes, therefore, the petty ambition of being thought a reader of forgotten
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
books; his aim being not to add to our pre&s;ent &s;tock of hi&s;tory, but to contract it.</P>
<P>The books which have been u&s;ed in this abridgement are chiefly Rapin, Carte, Smollett, and Hume. They have each their peculiar admirers, in proportion as the reader is &s;tudious of hi&s;torical antiquities, fond of minute anecdote, a warm parti|zan, or a deliberate rea&s;oner. Of the&s;e I have particularly taken Hume for my guide, as far as he goes; and it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that wherever I was ob|liged to abridge his work I did it with reluctance, as I &s;carce cut out a line that did not contain a beauty.</P>
<P>But though I mu&s;t warmly &s;ub&s;cribe to the learning, elegance, and depth of Mr. Hume's hi&s;tory, yet I cannot entirely acquie&s;ce in his principles. With regard to religion, he &s;eems de&s;irous of playing a double part, of appearing to &s;ome readers
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
as if he reverenced, and to others as if he ridiculed it. He &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of the political nece&s;&s;ity of religion in every &s;tate; but at the &s;ame time he would every where in&s;inuate, that it owes its authority to no higher an origin. Thus he weakens its influence, while he con|tends for its utility, and vainly hopes that while free-thinkers &s;hall applaud his &s;ceptici&s;m, real believers will re|verence him for his zeal.</P>
<P>In his opinions re&s;pecting government, perhaps, al&s;o, he may be &s;ometimes re|prehen&s;ible; but in a country like ours, where mutual contention contributes to the &s;ecurity of the con&s;titution, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for an hi&s;torian, who attempts to have any opinion, to &s;atisfy all parties. It is not yet decided in po|litics, whether the diminution of kingly power in England tends to encrea&s;e the happine&s;s, or the freedom of the people. For my own part, from &s;eeing the bad
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
effects of the tyranny of the great in tho&s;e republican &s;tates that pretend to be free, I cannot help wi&s;hing that our monarchs may &s;till be allowed to enjoy the power of controlling the encroach|ments of the great at home. A king may ea&s;ily be re&s;trained from doing wrong, as he is but one man; but if a number of the great are permitted to divide all au|thority, who can puni&s;h them if they abu&s;e it? Upon this principle, there|fore, and not from any empty notion of divine or hereditary right, &s;ome may think I have leaned towards monarchy. But as in the things I have hitherto written, I have neither allured the vanity of the great by flattery, nor &s;a|tisfied the malignity of the vulgar by &s;candal, as I have endeavoured to get an hone&s;t reputation by liberal pur&s;uits, it is hoped the reader will admit my im|partiality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the BRITONS before the Arrival of the ROMANS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is fortunate for mankind, that tho&s;e pe|riods of hi&s;tory which are the lea&s;t &s;erviceable, are the lea&s;t known. It has been the &s;tudy of many learned men to re&s;cue from ob&s;curity, and throw light upon tho&s;e early ages when the Britons were wholly barbarous, and their country uncultivated. But the&s;e re&s;earches have generally terminated in conjecture; &s;o that from whence Britain was at fir&s;t peopled, or took its name; is &s;till uncertain. The va|riety
<PB N="2" REF="12">
of opinions upon this head &s;erve to prove the futility of all.</P>
<P>It will therefore be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that this beautiful i&s;land, by &s;ome thought the large&s;t in the world, was called Britannia by the Romans long before the time of Cae&s;ar. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that this name was ori|ginally given it by the merchants who re&s;orted hither from the Continent. The&s;e called the inhabitants by one common name of Briths, from the cu&s;tom among the natives of painting their naked bodies, and &s;mall &s;hields, with an azure blue, which in the language of the country was called Brith, and which &s;erved to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them from tho&s;e &s;trangers who came a|mong them for the purpo&s;es of trade or al|liance.</P>
<P>The Britons were but very little known to the re&s;t of the world before the time of the Romans. The coa&s;ts oppo&s;ite Gaul indeed were frequented by merchants who traded thither for &s;uch commodities as the natives were able to produce. The&s;e, it is thought, after a time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of all the maritime places where they had at fir&s;t been permitted to re&s;ide. There, finding the country fertile, and commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade, they &s;ettled upon the &s;ea-&s;ide, and in|troduced
<PB N="3" REF="13">
the practice of agriculture. But it was very different with the inland inhabi|tants of the country, who con&s;idered them|&s;elves as the lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil. The&s;e avoided all corre&s;pondence with the new comers, whom they con&s;idered as intruders up|on their property.</P>
<P>The inland inhabitants are repre&s;ented as ex|tremely numerous, living in cottages thatched with &s;traw, and feeding large herds of cattle. Their hou&s;es were &s;cattered all over the country, without ob&s;ervance of order or di&s;tance, being placed at &s;maller or greater intervals as they were invited by the fertility of the &s;oil, or the convenience of wood and water. They lived mo&s;tly upon milk, or fle&s;h procured by the chace. What cloaths they wore to cover any part of their bodies, were u&s;ually the &s;kins of bea&s;ts; but much of their bodies, as the arms, legs, and thighs, was left naked, and tho&s;e parts were u&s;ually painted blue. Their hair, which was long, flowed down upon their backs and &s;houlders, while their beards were kept clo&s;e &s;haven, except upon the upper lip, where it was &s;uffered to grow. The dre&s;s of &s;avage nations is every where pretty much the &s;ame, being calculated rather to in&s;pire terror than to excite love or re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14">The commodities exported from Britain were chiefly hides and tin. This metal was then thought peculiar to the i&s;land, and was in much reque&s;t abroad, both in nearer and re|moter regions. Some &s;ilver mines were al&s;o known, but not in common u&s;e, as the inha|bitants had but little knowledge how to dig, refine, or improve them. Pearls al&s;o were frequently found on their &s;hores, but neither clear nor coloured like the oriental; and there|fore, in no great e&s;teem among &s;trangers. They had but little iron; and what they had, was u&s;ed either for arms, or for rings, which was a &s;ort of money current among them. They had bra&s;s money al&s;o, but this was all brought from abroad.</P>
<P>Their language, cu&s;toms, religion, and go|vernment, were generally the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the Gauls, their neighbours of the Conti|nent. As to their government, it con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal &s;mall principalities, each under its re|&s;pective leader; and this &s;eems to be the ear|lie&s;t mode of dominion with which mankind is acquainted, and deduced from the natural pri|vileges of paternal authority. Whether the&s;e &s;mall principalities de&s;cended by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or were elected in con&s;equence of the advantages of age, wi&s;dom, or valour in the families of the
<PB N="5" REF="15">
princes, is not recorded. Upon great, or uncom|mon dangers, a commander in chief was cho&s;en by common con&s;ent, in a general a&s;&s;embly; and to him was committed the conduct of the gene|ral intere&s;t, the power of making peace, or leading to war. In the choice of a per&s;on of &s;uch power, it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, that unani|mity could not alway be found; whence it often happened, that the &s;eparate tribes were defeat|ed one after the other before they could unite under a &s;ingle leader for their mutual &s;afety.</P>
<P>Their forces con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of foot, and yet they could bring a con&s;iderable number of hor&s;e into the field upon great occa&s;ions. They like|wi&s;e u&s;ed chariots in battle, which, with &s;hort &s;cythes fa&s;tened to the ends of the axletrees, inflicted terrible wounds, &s;preading terror and deva&s;tation where&s;oever they drove. Nor while the chariots were thus de&s;troying, were the warriors who conducted them unemployed. The&s;e darted their javelins again&s;t the enemy, ran along the beam, leapt on the ground, re|&s;umed their &s;eat, &s;topt, or turned their hor&s;es at full &s;peed, and &s;ometimes cunningly retreat|ed, to draw the enemy into confu&s;ion. No|thing can be more terrible than the idea of a charioteer thus driving furiou&s;ly in the mid&s;t of dangers; but the&s;e machines &s;eem to have
<PB N="6" REF="16">
been more dreadful than dangerous, for they were quickly laid a&s;ide, when this warlike people was in&s;tructed in the more regular arts of war.</P>
<P>The religion of the Britons was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of their government; and the Druids, who were the guardians of it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority among them. The&s;e endeavoured to impre&s;s the minds of the peo|ple with an opinion of their &s;kill in the arts of divination; they offered &s;acrifices in public and private, and pretended to explain the imme|diate will of Heaven. No &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;ti|tion was ever more terrible than theirs; be|&s;ides the &s;evere penalties which they were per|mitted to inflict in this world, they inculcated the eternal tran&s;migration of &s;ouls, and thus extended their authority as far as the fears of their votaries. They &s;acrificed human victims, which they burned in large wicker idols, made &s;o capacious as to contain a multitude of per|&s;ons at once, who were thus con&s;umed to|gether. The female Druids plunged their knives into the brea&s;ts of the pri&s;oners taken in war, and prophe&s;ied from the manner in which the blood happened to &s;tream from the wound. Their altars con&s;i&s;ted of four broad &s;tones, three &s;et edge-ways, and the fourth at top,
<PB N="7" REF="17">
many of which remain to this day. To the&s;e rites, tending to impre&s;s ignorance with awe, they added the au&s;terity of their manners, and the &s;implicity of their lives. They lived in woods, caves, and hollow trees; their food was acorns and berries, and their drink water; by the&s;e arts, they were not only re&s;pected, but al|mo&s;t adored by the people. They were admir|ed not only for knowing more than other men, but for de&s;pi&s;ing what all others valued and pur&s;ued. Hence they were patiently permit|ted to puni&s;h and correct crimes from which they them&s;elves were &s;uppo&s;ed to be wholly free; and their authority was &s;o great, that not only the property, but al&s;o the lives of the people were entirely at their di&s;po&s;al. No laws were in&s;tituted by the princes, or common a&s;&s;emblies, without their advice and approbation; no per&s;on was puni&s;hed by bonds, or death, without their pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence; no plunder taken in war was u&s;ed by the captor until the Druids determined what part they &s;hould &s;eclude for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that the manners of the people took a tincture from the di&s;ci|pline of their teachers. Their lives were &s;im|ple, but they were marked with cruelty and fiercene&s;s; their courage was great, but neither
<PB N="8" REF="18">
dignified by mercy nor per&s;everance. In &s;hort, to have a ju&s;t idea of what the Britons then were, we have only to turn to the &s;avage na|tions which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in primeval rudene&s;s. Temperate rather from nece&s;&s;ity than choice; patient of fatigue, yet incon&s;tant in attach|ment; bold, improvident, and rapacious; &s;uch is the picture of &s;avage life at pre|&s;ent, and &s;uch it appears to have been from the beginning. Little entertainment, therefore, can be expected from the accounts of a nation thus circum&s;tanced, nor can its tran&s;actions come properly under the notice of the hi&s;torian, &s;ince they are too minutely divided to be exhibited at one view; the actors are too barbarous to intere&s;t the reader; and no &s;kill can be &s;hewn in developing the motives and councils of a peo|ple chiefly actuated by &s;udden and tumultuary gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II. From the De&s;cent of JULIUS CAESAR to the Relin|qui&s;hing of the I&s;land by the ROMANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Britons, in the rude and barbarous &s;tate in which we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed them, &s;eemed to &s;tand in need of more poli&s;hed in|&s;tructors; and indeed whatever evils may attend the conque&s;t of heroes, their &s;ucce&s;s has generally produced one good effect, in di&s;&s;eminating the arts of refinement and humanity. It ever hap|pens, when a barbarous nation is conquered by another more advanced in the arts of peace, that it gains in elegance a recompence for what it lo&s;es in liberty. The Britons had long re|mained in this rude but independent &s;tate, when Cae&s;ar having over-run Gaul with his victories, and willing &s;till farther to extend his fame, determined upon the conque&s;t of a country that &s;eemed to promi&s;e an ea&s;y triumph. He was allured neither by the riches nor the renown of the inhabitants; but being am|bitious rather of &s;plendid than of u&s;eful
<PB N="10" REF="20">
conque&s;ts, he was willing to carry the Roman arms into a country, the remote &s;ituation of which would add &s;eeming difficulty to the enterprize, and con&s;equently produce an in|crea&s;e of reputation. His pretence was, to puni&s;h the&s;e i&s;landers for having &s;ent &s;uccours to the Gauls while he waged war again&s;t that nation, as well as for granting an a&s;ylum to &s;uch of the enemy as had &s;ought protection from his re&s;entment. The natives, informed of his intention, were &s;en&s;ible of the unequal conte&s;t, and endeavoured to appea&s;e him by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He received their amba&s;&s;adors with great complacency, and having exhorted them to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in the &s;ame &s;enti|ments, in the mean time made preparations for the execution of his de&s;ign. When the troops de&s;tined for the expedition were em|barked, he &s;et &s;ail for Britain about midnight, and the next morning arrived on the coa&s;t near Dover, where he &s;aw the rocks and cliffs co|vered with armed men to oppo&s;e his landing.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="55" UNIT="Ant. Ch."> Finding it impracticable to gain the &s;hore where he fir&s;t intended, from the agitation of the &s;ea and the impending mountains, he re&s;olved to chu&s;e a landing-place of greater &s;ecurity. The place he cho&s;e was about eight miles far|ther on, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e at Deal, where an in|clining
<PB N="11" REF="21">
&s;hore and a level country invited his attempts. The poor, naked, ill-armed Bri|tons, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, were but an unequal match for the di&s;ciplined Romans, who had be|fore conquered Gaul, and afterwards became the conquerors of the world. However, they made a brave oppo&s;ition again&s;t the veteran army; the conflicts between them were fierce, the lo&s;&s;es mutual, and the &s;ucce&s;s va|rious. The Britons had cho&s;en Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus for their commander in chief, but the petty princes under his command either de&s;iring his &s;tation or &s;u&s;pecting his fidelity, threw off their allegiance. Some of them fled with their forces into the internal parts of the kingdom, others &s;ubmitted to Cae&s;ar, till at length Ca&s;|&s;ibelaunus him&s;elf, weakened by &s;o many de|&s;ertions, re&s;olved upon making what terms he was able while he yet had power to keep the field. The conditions offered by Cae&s;ar and accepted by him were, that he &s;hould &s;end to the Continent double the number of ho&s;tages at fir&s;t demanded, and that he &s;hould acknow|ledge &s;ubjection to the Romans.</P>
<P>The Romans were plea&s;ed with the name of this new and remote conque&s;t, and the &s;enate decreed a &s;upplication of twenty days, in con|&s;equence of their general's &s;ucce&s;s. Having
<PB N="12" REF="22">
therefore in this manner rather di&s;covered than &s;ubdued the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, Cae|&s;ar returned into Gaul with his forces, and left the Britons to enjoy their cu&s;toms, religion, and laws. But the inhabitants, thus relieved from the terror of his arms, ne|glected the performance of their &s;tipulations, and only two of their &s;tates &s;ent over ho&s;tages, according to the treaty. Cae&s;ar it is likely was not much di&s;plea&s;ed at the omi&s;&s;ion, as it furni&s;hed him with a pretext of vi&s;iting the i&s;land once more, and completing a conque&s;t which he had only begun.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the en&s;uing &s;pring, he &s;et &s;ail for Britain with eight hundred &s;hips; and, arriving at the place of his former de&s;cent, he landed with|out oppo&s;ition. The i&s;landers being apprized of his inva&s;ion, had a&s;&s;embled an army and march|ed down to the &s;ea-&s;ide to oppo&s;e him; but &s;eeing the number of his forces, and the whole &s;ea as it were covered with his &s;hipping, they were &s;truck with con&s;ternation, and retired to their places of &s;ecurity. The Romans, how|ever, pur&s;ued them to their retreats, until at la&s;t common danger induced the&s;e poor barbarians to forget their former di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and to unite their whole &s;trength for the mutual defence of their liberty and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus was
<PB N="13" REF="23">
cho&s;en to conduct the common cau&s;e; and for &s;ome time he harra&s;&s;ed the Romans in their march, and revived the de&s;ponding hopes of his countrymen. But no oppo&s;ition that undi&s;ci|plined &s;trength could make was able to repre&s;s the vigour and intrepidity of Cae&s;ar. He di&s;|comfited the Britons in every action; he ad|vanced into the country, pa&s;&s;ed the Thames in the face of the enemy, took and burned the capital city of Ca&s;&s;ibelaunus, e&s;tabli&s;hed his ally Mandubratius as &s;overeign of the Tri|nobantes; and having obliged the inhabi|tants to make him new &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, he again returned with his army into Gaul, having made him&s;elf rather the nominal than the real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Whatever the &s;tipulated tribute might have been, it is more than probable, as there was no authority left to exact it, that it was but indif|ferently paid. Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Augu&s;|tus, that emperor had formed a de&s;ign of vi|&s;iting Britain, but was diverted from it by an unexpected revolt of the Pannonians. Some years after he re&s;umed his de&s;ign; but be|ing met in his way by the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dors, who promi&s;ed the accu&s;tomed tribute, and made the u&s;ual &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, he de&s;i&s;ted from his intentions.

wholly addicted to the Roman method of fight|ing, neverthele&s;s adopted &s;everal of their im|provements, as well in their arms as in their arrangement in the field. Their ferocity to &s;trangers, for which they had been always re|markable, was mitigated; and they began to permit an intercour&s;e of commerce even in the internal parts of the country. They &s;till, however, continued to live as herd&s;men and hunters, a manife&s;t proof that the country was as yet but thinly inhabited.

<P>The wild extravagancies of Caligula, by which he threatened Britain with an inva&s;ion, &s;erved rather to expo&s;e him to ridicule than the i&s;land to danger. The Britons therefore, for almo&s;t a century, enjoyed their liberty unmo|le&s;ted, till at length the Romans, in the reign of Claudius, began to think &s;eriou&s;ly of re|ducing them under their dominion. The ex|pedition for this purpo&s;e was conducted in the beginning by Plautius and other command|ers,
<PB N="16" REF="26">
with that &s;ucce&s;s which u&s;ually attended the Roman arms.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="A.D."> Claudius him&s;elf finding affairs &s;ufficiently prepared for his reception, made a journey thi|ther, and received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch &s;tates as, living by commerce, were willing to pur|cha&s;e tranquillity at the expence of freedom. It is true that many of the inland provinces preferred their native &s;implicity to imported elegance, and, rather than bow their necks to the Roman yoke, offered their bo&s;oms to the &s;word. But the &s;outhern coa&s;t, with all the adjacent inland country, was &s;eized by the conquerors, who &s;ecured the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by for|tifying camps, building fortre&s;&s;es, and planting colonies. The other parts of the country either thought them&s;elves in no danger, or continued patient &s;pectators of the approach|ing deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>Caractacus was the fir&s;t who &s;eemed willing, by a vigorous effort, to re&s;cue his country and repel its in&s;ulting and rapacious conquerors. The venality and corruption of the Roman praetors and officers who were appointed to levy the contributions in Britain &s;erved to excite the indignation of the natives, and give &s;pirit to his attempts. This rude &s;oldier, though with
<PB N="17" REF="27">
inferior forces, continued, for above the &s;pace of nine years, to oppo&s;e and harra&s;s the Ro|mans; &s;o that at length O&s;torius Scapula was &s;ent over to command their armies. He was more &s;ucce&s;sful than his predece&s;&s;ors. He ad|vanced the Roman conque&s;ts over Britain, pierced the country of the Silures,<MILESTONE N="50" UNIT="A.D."> a warlike nation along the banks of the Severn, and at length came up with Caractacus, who had ta|ken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a very advantageous po&s;t up|on an inacce&s;&s;ible mountain, wa&s;hed by a deep and rapid &s;tream. The unfortunate Briti&s;h ge|neral, when he &s;aw the enemy approaching, drew up his army, compo&s;ed of different tribes, and going from rank to rank, exhorted them to &s;trike the la&s;t blow, for liberty, &s;afety, and life. To the&s;e exhortations his &s;oldiers replied with &s;houts of determined valour. But what could undi&s;ciplined bravery avail again&s;t the attack of an army &s;killed in all the arts of war, and in&s;pired by a long train of conque&s;ts. The Britons were, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, to|tally routed; and a few days after Caractacus him&s;elf was delivered up to the conquerors by Carti&s;mandua, queen of the Brigantes, with whom he had taken refuge. The capture of this general was received with &s;uch joy at Rome, that Claudius commanded that he
<PB N="18" REF="28">
&s;hould be brought from Britain, in order to be exhibited as a &s;pectacle to the Roman people. Accordingly, on the day appointed for that purpo&s;e, the Emperor a&s;cending his throne, ordered the captives, and Caractacus among the number, to be brought into his pre&s;ence. The va&s;&s;als of the Briti&s;h king, with the &s;poils taken in war, were fir&s;t brought forward; the&s;e were followed by his family, who, with abject lamentations, were &s;een to implore for mercy. La&s;t of all came Caractacus him&s;elf, with an undaunted air and a dignified a&s;pect. He appeared no way dejected at the amazing concour&s;e of &s;pectators that were gathered upon this occa&s;ion, but ca&s;ting his eyes on the &s;plendours that &s;urrounded him, <Q REND="inline">"Alas, cried he, how is it po&s;&s;ible that a people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch magnificence at home could envy me an hum|ble cottage in Britain!"</Q> When brought into the Emperor's pre&s;ence, he is &s;aid to have ad|dre&s;&s;ed him in the following manner: <Q REND="inline">"Had my moderation been equal to my birth and for|tune, I had arrived in this city not as a cap|tive but as a friend. But my pre&s;ent misfor|tunes redound as much to your honour as to my di&s;grace, and the ob&s;tinacy of my oppo&s;i|tion &s;erves to increa&s;e the &s;plendours of your victory. Had I &s;urrendered my&s;elf in the begin|ning
<PB N="19" REF="29">
of the conte&s;t, neither my di&s;grace nor your glory would have attracted the attention of the world, and my fate would have been buried in general oblivion. I am now at your mercy, but if my life be &s;pared I &s;hall remain an eter|nal monument of your clemency and modera|tion."</Q> The Emperor was affected with the Briti&s;h hero's misfortunes, and won by his addre&s;s. He ordered him to be unchained upon the &s;pot, with the re&s;t of the captives, and the fir&s;t u&s;e they made of their liberty was to go and pro&s;trate them&s;elves before the Empre&s;s Agrippina, who, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, had been an interce&s;&s;or for their freedom.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e misfortunes, the Bri|tons were not &s;ubdued, and this i&s;land was re|garded by the ambitious Romans as a field in which military honour might &s;till be acquired. The Britons made one expiring effort more to recover their liberty, in the times of Nero,<MILESTONE N="59" UNIT="A.D."> taking advantage of the ab&s;ence of Paulinus the Roman general, who was employed in &s;ub|duing the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey. That &s;mall i&s;land, which was &s;eparated from Britain by a narrow channel, &s;till continued the chief &s;eat of the Druidical &s;uper&s;titions, and con&s;tantly afforded a retreat to their defeated forces. It was thought nece&s;&s;ary therefore to &s;ubdue that
<PB N="20" REF="30">
place, in order to extirpate a religion that di&s;|dained &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to foreign laws or leaders; and Paulinus, the greate&s;t general of his age, undertook the ta&s;k. The Britons endeavoured to ob&s;truct his landing on that la&s;t retreat of their &s;uper&s;titions and liberties, both by the force of their arms and the terrors of their religion. The prie&s;ts and i&s;landers were drawn up in order of battle upon the &s;hore, to oppo&s;e his landing. The women, dre&s;&s;ed like furies, with di&s;hevelled hair and torches in their hands, poured forth the mo&s;t terrible execra|tions. Such a &s;ight at fir&s;t confounded the Romans, and fixed them motionle&s;s on the &s;pot, &s;o that they received the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault without oppo&s;ition. But Paulinus exhorting his troops to de&s;pi&s;e the menaces of an ab&s;urd &s;uper&s;tition, impelled them to the attack, drove the Britons off the field, burned the Druids in the &s;ame fires they had prepared for their cap|tive enemies, and de&s;troyed all their con&s;ecrat|ed groves and altars.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Britons, taking advan|tage of his ab&s;ence, re&s;olved by a general in|&s;urrection to free them&s;elves from that &s;tate of abject &s;ervitude to which they were reduced by the Romans. They had many motives to ag|gravate their re&s;entment; the greatne&s;s of
<PB N="21" REF="31">
their taxes, which were levied with unremit|ting &s;everity; the cruel in&s;olence of their con|querors, who reproached that very poverty which they had cau&s;ed; but particularly the cruel treatment of Boadicea, queen of the Ice|ni, drove them at la&s;t into open rebellion. Pra&s;atagus, king of the Iceni, at his death had bequeathed one half of his dominions to the Romans, and the other to his daughters, thus hoping by the &s;acrifice of a part, to &s;e|cure the re&s;t in his family: but it had a diffe|rent effect; for the Roman procurator imme|diately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole; and when Boadicea, the widow of the decea&s;ed, at|tempted to remon&s;trate, he ordered her to be &s;courged like a &s;lave, and violated the cha&s;tity of her daughters. The&s;e outrages were &s;uffi|cient to produce a revolt through the whole i&s;land. The Iceni, as being the mo&s;t deeply in|tere&s;ted in the quarrel, were the fir&s;t to take arms; all the other &s;tates &s;oon followed the ex|ample; and Boadicea, a woman of great beauty and ma&s;culine &s;pirit, was appointed to head the common forces, which amounted to two hundred and thirty thou&s;and fighting men. The&s;e, exa&s;perated by their wrongs, attacked &s;everal of the Roman &s;ettlements and colonies with &s;ucce&s;s. Paulinus ha&s;tened to relieve
<PB N="22" REF="32">
London, which was already a flouri&s;hing colo|ny; but found on his arrival that it would be requi&s;ite for the general &s;afety to abandon that place to the mercile&s;s fury of the enemy. Lon|don was &s;oon therefore reduced to a&s;hes; &s;uch of the inhabitants as remained in it were ma&s;&s;acred; and the Romans, with all other &s;trangers, to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and, were cruelly put to the &s;word. Flu&s;hed with the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the Britons no longer &s;ought to avoid the enemy, but boldly came to the place where Paulinus awaited their arrival, po&s;ted in a very advantageous manner with a body of ten thou&s;and men. The battle was ob&s;tinate and bloody. Boadicea her&s;elf appeared in a chariot with her two daughters, and harrangued her army with ma&s;culine intrepidity; but the irregular and undi&s;ciplined bravery of her troops was unable to re&s;i&s;t the cool intrepidity of the Romans. They were routed with great &s;laughter, eighty thou&s;and peri&s;hed in the field, and an infinite number were made pri&s;oners, while Boadicea her&s;elf, fearing to fall into the hands of the enraged victor, put an end to her life by poi&s;on. Nero &s;oon after recalled Pau|linus from a government, where, by &s;uffering and inflicting &s;o many &s;everities, he was judged improper to compo&s;e the angry and alarmed
<PB N="23" REF="33">
minds of the natives. After an interval, Cerealis received the command from Ve&s;pa|&s;ian, and by his bravery propagated the terror of the Roman arms. Julius Frontinus &s;uc|ceeded Cerealis both in authority and reputa|tion. The general who finally e&s;tabli&s;hed the dominion of the Romans in this i&s;land was Ju|lius Agricola, who governed it during the reigns of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Titus, and Domitian, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf as well by his courage as hu|manity.</P>
<P>Agricola, who is con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t characters in hi&s;tory, formed a regular plan for &s;ubduing and civilizing the i&s;land, and thus ren|dering the acqui&s;ition u&s;eful to the conquer|ors. As the northern part of the country was lea&s;t tractable, he carried his victorious arms thither, and defeated the undi&s;ciplined enemy in every encounter. He pierced into the for|merly inacce&s;&s;ible fore&s;ts and mountains of Ca|ledonia, he drove onward all tho&s;e fierce and untractable &s;pirits who preferred famine to &s;la|very, and who, rather than &s;ubmit, cho&s;e to remain in perpetual ho&s;tility. Nor was it without oppo&s;ition that he thus made his way into a country rude and impervious by nature. He was oppo&s;ed by Galgacus, at the head of a numerous army, whom he defeated in a deci&s;ive
<PB N="24" REF="34">
action, in which con&s;iderable numbers were &s;lain. Being thus &s;ucce&s;sful, he did not think proper to pur&s;ue the enemy into their re|treats, but embarking a body of troops on board his fleet, he ordered the commander to &s;urround the whole coa&s;t of Britain, which had not been di&s;covered to be an i&s;land till the pre|ceding year. This armament, pur&s;uant to his orders, &s;teered to the northward, and there &s;ubdued the Orkneys; then making the tour of the whole i&s;land, it arrived in the port of Sand|wich, without having met the lea&s;t di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>During the&s;e military enterprizes Agricola was ever attentive to the arts of peace. He at|tempted to humanize the fiercene&s;s of tho&s;e who acknowledged his power, by introducing the Roman laws, habits, manners, and learn|ing. He taught them to de&s;ire and rai&s;e all the conveniencies of life, in&s;tructed them in the arts of agriculture, and, in order to pro|tect them in their peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he drew a rampart, and fixed a train of garri&s;ons between them and their northern neighbours; thus cutting off the ruder and more barren parts of the i&s;land, and &s;ecuring the Roman province from the inva&s;ion of a fierce and ne|ce&s;&s;itous enemy. In this manner the Britons being almo&s;t-totally &s;ubdued, now began to
<PB N="25" REF="35">
throw off all hopes of recovering their for|mer liberty; and having often experienced the &s;uperiority of the Romans, con&s;ented to &s;ub|mit, and were content with &s;afety. From that time,<MILESTONE N="78" UNIT="A.D."> the Romans &s;eemed more de&s;irous of &s;ecuring what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, than of making new conque&s;ts, and were employed rather in re|pre&s;&s;ing than puni&s;hing their re&s;tle&s;s northern invaders.</P>
<P>For &s;everal years after the time of Agricola, a profound peace &s;eems to have prevailed in Britain, and little mention is made of the af|fairs of the i&s;land by any hi&s;torian. The only incidents which occur, are &s;ome &s;editions a|mong the Roman legions quartered there, and &s;ome u&s;urpations of the imperial dignity by the Roman governors. The natives remained to|tally &s;ubdued and di&s;pirited; the arts of lux|ury had been introduced among them, and &s;eemed to afford a wretched compen&s;ation for their former independence. All the men who had a pa&s;&s;ion for liberty were long &s;ince de|&s;troyed; the flower of their youth were draft|ed out of the i&s;land to &s;erve in foreign wars, and tho&s;e who remained were bred up in &s;er|vitude and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Such, therefore, were very unlikely to give any di&s;turbance to their governors; and, in fact, in&s;tead of con&s;idering
<PB N="26" REF="36">
their yoke as a burthen, they were taught to regard it as their ornament and protection. No|thing, therefore, was likely to &s;hake the power of Rome in the i&s;land, but the di&s;&s;entions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Romans them&s;elves, and that dreadful period at la&s;t arrived.</P>
<P>Rome, that had for ages given laws to na|tions, and diffu&s;ed &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion over the known world, at length began to &s;ink under her own magnificence. Mankind, as if by a general con&s;ent, ro&s;e up to vindi|cate their natural freedom; almo&s;t every na|tion a&s;&s;erting that independence which they had been long &s;o unju&s;tly deprived of. It was in the&s;e turbulent times, that the emperors found them&s;elves obliged to recruit their legions from the troops that were placed to defend the frontier provinces. When the heart of the empire was contended for, it was not much con&s;idered in what manner the extremities were to be defended. In this manner, the more di&s;tant parts of the empire were frequently left without a guard; and the weakne&s;s of the go|vernment there, frequently excited fre&s;h in&s;ur|rections among the natives. The&s;e, with thou|&s;and other calamities, daily grew greater; and, as the enemies of the Roman people en|crea&s;ed, their own di&s;&s;en&s;ions among each
<PB N="27" REF="37">
other &s;eemed to encrea&s;e in the &s;ame propor|tion.</P>
<P>During the&s;e &s;truggles the Briti&s;h youth were frequently drawn away into Gaul, to give ineffectual &s;uccour to the various conten|ders for the empire, who, falling in every at|tempt, only left the name of tyrants behind them. In the mean time, as the Roman forces decrea&s;ed in Britain, the Picts and Scots conti|nued &s;till more boldly to infe&s;t the northern parts; and cro&s;&s;ing the friths, which the Ro|mans could not guard, in little wicker boats, covered with leather, filled the country where|ever they came with &s;laughter and con&s;terna|tion. When repul&s;ed by &s;uperior numbers, as was at fir&s;t always the ca&s;e, they retired with the &s;poil, and watched for the next opportu|nity of inva&s;ion, when the Romans were drawn away into the remoter parts of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The&s;e enterpri&s;es were often repeated, and as often repre&s;&s;ed, but &s;till with dimini&s;hing vi|gour on the &s;ide of the defendants. The &s;outhern natives being accu&s;tomed to have re|cour&s;e to Rome, as well for protection as for laws, made &s;upplication to the emperors, and had one legion &s;ent over for their defence. This relief was in the beginning attended with the de&s;ired ef|fect, the barbarous invaders were repul&s;ed and
<PB N="28" REF="38">
driven back to their native de&s;erts and moun|tains. They returned, however, when the Ro|man forces were withdrawn; and although they were again repul&s;ed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a legion once more &s;ent from Rome, yet they too well perceived the weakne&s;s of the enemy, and their own &s;uperior &s;kill in arms.</P>
<P>At length, in the reign of Valentinian the younger, the empire of Rome began to tremble for its capital, and being fa|tigued with di&s;tant expeditions, informed the wretched Britons, whom their own arts had en|feebled, that they were now no longer to ex|pect foreign protection. They accordingly, drew away from the i&s;land all the Romans, and many of the Britons who were fit for military &s;ervices. Thus, taking their la&s;t leave of the i&s;land, they left the natives to the choice of their own government and kings. They gave them the be&s;t in&s;tructions the calamitous times would permit, for exerci&s;ing their arms, and repairing their ramparts. They helped the natives to erect a-new a wall of &s;tone built by the emperor Severus acro&s;s the i&s;land, which they had not at that time artizans &s;kilful enough among them&s;elves to repair. Having thus prepared for their departure in a friendly manner, the Romans left the i&s;land, never more
<PB N="29" REF="39">
to return,<MILESTONE N="488" UNIT="A.D."> after having been ma&s;ters of it dur|ing the cour&s;e of near four centuries.</P>
<P>It may be doubted, whether the arts which the Romans planted among the i&s;landers were not rather prejudicial than &s;erviceable to them, as they only contributed to invite the invader, with|out furni&s;hing the means of defence. If we con&s;ider the many public ways, and villas of plea&s;ure that were then among them, the many &s;chools in&s;tituted for the in&s;truction of youth, the numberle&s;s coins, &s;tatues, te&s;&s;elat|ed pavements, and other curio&s;ities that were common at that time, we can have no doubt but that the Britons made a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the arts of peace, although they declined in tho&s;e of war. But, perhaps, an attempt at once to introduce the&s;e advantages will ever be ineffectual. The arts of peace and refinement mu&s;t ri&s;e by &s;low degrees in every country, and can never be propagated with the &s;ame rapidity by which new governments may be introduced. It will take, perhaps, a cour&s;e of &s;ome centuries, before a barbarous people can entirely adopt the manners of their conquerors; &s;o that all the pains be&s;towed by the Romans in educating the Britons, only &s;erv|ed to render them a more de&s;irable object of inva&s;ion, and dre&s;&s;ed them up as victims for &s;ucceeding &s;laughter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The BRITONS and SAXONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Britons being now left to them|&s;elves, con&s;idered their new liberties as their greate&s;t calamity. They had been long taught to lean upon others for &s;upport; and that now taken away, they found them&s;elves too feeble to make any oppo&s;ition. Far from practi&s;ing the le&s;&s;ons they had received from the Romans, they aggravated their misfor|tunes with unavailing complaints, which only &s;erved to render them &s;till more contemptible. Unaccu&s;tomed both to the perils of war, and to the cares of civil government, they found them&s;elves incapable of forming, or executing any mea&s;ures for re&s;i&s;ting the incur&s;ions of their barbarous invaders. Though the Ro|man &s;oldiers were drawn away, their families and de&s;cendants were &s;till &s;pread over the face of the country, and left without a &s;ingle per|&s;on of conduct or courage to defend them. To complete the mea&s;ure of their wretchedne&s;s, the few men of any note who remained among them, were infected with the ambition of be|ing
<PB N="31" REF="41">
foremo&s;t in command; and di&s;regarding the common enemy, were engaged in di&s;&s;en|&s;ions among each other.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Picts and Scots unit|ing together, began to look upon Britain as their own, and attacked the northern wall with redoubled forces. This rampart, though for|merly built of &s;tone, had been &s;ome time be|fore repaired with fods; and con&s;equently, was but ill fitted to repre&s;s the attacks of a per&s;evering enemy. The a&s;&s;ailants, therefore, were not at the trouble of procuring military engines, or battering rams to overthrow it, but with iron hooks pulled down the inactive defenders from the top, and then undermined the fortification at their lei&s;ure. Having thus opened to them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age, they ravaged the whole country with impunity, while the Britons &s;ought precarious &s;helter in their woods and mountains.</P>
<P>In this exigence, the unhappy Britons had a third time recour&s;e to Rome, hoping to extort by importunity, that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which was de|nied upon prudential motives. Aetius, the re|nowned general of Valentinian, had about that time gained con&s;iderable advantages over the Goths, and &s;eemed to give fre&s;h hopes of re|&s;toring the Roman empire. It was to him
<PB N="32" REF="42">
they applied for &s;uccour, in a &s;train of the mo&s;t abject &s;ollicitation. <HI>The Barbarians,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>on the one hand, drive us into the &s;ea; the &s;ea, on the other, drives us back upon the Barbarians. We have only the hard choice left us, of peri&s;hing by the &s;word, or being drowned in the deep.</HI> Such, however, were the calamities of the Romans them&s;elves, &s;urrounded as they were by myriads of &s;avage nations, that they could yield no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;uch remote and un&s;erviceable allies.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="448" UNIT="A.D."> The Britons, thus neglected, were reduced to de&s;pair; while, having left their fields uncul|tivated, they began to find the mi&s;eries of fa|mine, added to the horrors of war. It hap|pened, however, that the barbarians them|&s;elves began to feel the &s;ame inconveniencies in a country which they had ravaged; and be|ing harra&s;&s;ed by the irruptions of the Bri|tons, as well as the want of nece&s;&s;aries, they were obliged to retreat from the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom laden with &s;poil.</P>
<P>The enemy having thus left the country open, the Britons joyfully i&s;&s;ued from their mountains and fore&s;ts, and pur&s;ued once more their u&s;ual arts of hu&s;bandry, which were at|tended with &s;uch abundance the &s;ucceeding

&s;ea&s;on, that they &s;oon forgot all their pa&s;t mi|&s;eries. But it had been happy for them, if plenty had not removed one evil to plant an|other. They began, from a &s;tate of famine, to indulge them&s;elves in &s;uch riot and luxury, that their bodies were totally enervated, and their minds debauched.</P>
<P>Thus entirely occupied in the enjoyment of the pre&s;ent interval of peace, they made no provi&s;ion for re&s;i&s;ting the enemy, who were only taking breath to renew their former in|va&s;ions. Chri&s;tianity, indeed, had been intro|duced among them &s;ome time before; though, at what period, is not certainly known: however, to the other calamities of the &s;tate were added al&s;o their di&s;putes in theology. The di&s;ciples of Pelagius, who was a native of Britain, had encrea&s;ed in a great degree; and the clergy, who con&s;idered his opinions as heretical, were more &s;ollicitou&s;ly employed in re&s;i&s;ting them, than in oppo&s;ing the common enemy. Be&s;ides all the&s;e calamities, a terrible pe&s;ti|lence vi&s;ited the &s;outhern parts of the i&s;land, which thinned its inhabitants, and totally de|prived them of all power of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was in this deplorable and enfeebled &s;tate, that the Britons were informed of fre&s;h prepa|rations for an inva&s;ion from their mercile&s;s

northern neighbours. Wherefore, to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, they pitched upon Vortigern as their general and &s;overeign, a prince who is &s;aid to have rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;u|preme command by the murder of his prede|ce&s;&s;or. This &s;tep was only productive of fre&s;h calamities. Vortigern, in&s;tead of exerting what &s;trength yet remained in the kingdom, only &s;et him&s;elf to look about for foreign a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and the Saxons appeared to him at once the mo&s;t martial, and the mo&s;t likely to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Saxons were one branch of tho&s;e Go|thic nations, which, &s;warming from the nor|thern hive, came down to give laws, manners, and liberty to the re&s;t of Europe. A part of this people, under the name of Suevi, had, &s;ome time before Cae&s;ar's inva&s;ion of Gaul, &s;ub|dued and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive empire in Germany. The&s;e, for their &s;trength and va|lour, were formidable to all the German na|tions, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be more than a match for the gods them&s;elves in war. They were afterwards divided into &s;everal nations, and each became famous for &s;ubduing that country which was the object of its inva&s;ion. France, Germany, and England, were among the num|ber of their conque&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="45">There is a period between &s;avage rudene&s;s and exce&s;&s;ive refinement, which &s;eems pecu|liarly adapted for the purpo&s;es of war, and which fits mankind for great atchievements. In this &s;tate of half refinement, when com|pared to the Britons, the Saxons were at the time their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was thought nece&s;&s;ary. They dre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome degree of elegance, which the generality of the Britons, even though &s;o long under the in&s;titutions of the Romans, had not yet learned to practi&s;e. Their women u&s;ed linen garments, trimmed and &s;triped with purple. Their hair was bound in wreaths, or fell in curls upon their &s;houlders; their arms were bare, and their bo|&s;oms uncovered; fa&s;hions, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;eem peculiar to the ladies of Eng|land to this day. Their government was ge|nerally an elective monarchy, and &s;ometimes a republic. Their commanders were cho&s;en for their merit, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from duty when their authority was no longer needful. The &s;allries they were &s;upplied with, &s;eldom exceeded a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the honours they received, were the only reward of their &s;u|perior dangers and fatigues. The cu&s;tom of trying by twelve men is of Saxon original: &s;lavery was unknown among them, and they
<PB N="36" REF="46">
were taught to prefer death to a &s;hameful exi&s;tence. We are told by Marcellinus, that a body of them being taken pri&s;oners, were kept for exhibition on the amphitheatre at Rome, as gladiators, for the entertainment of the people. The morning, however, on which they were expected to perform, they were every one found dead in his cell, each chu&s;|ing rather a voluntary death, than to be the ignominious in&s;truments of brutal plea&s;ure to their conquerors. The cha&s;tity of this people is equally remarkable; and to be without children, was to be without prai&s;e. But their chief excellence, and what they mo&s;t gloried in, was their &s;kill in war. They had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, learned di&s;cipline from the Romans, whom they had often defeated, and had, for a century and an half before, made frequent de|&s;cents upon the coa&s;ts of Britain, for the &s;ake of plunder. They were, therefore, a very formi|dable enemy to the Romans when &s;ettled there; and an officer was appointed to oppo&s;e their inroads, under the title of the <HI>Count of the Saxon &s;hore.</HI> Thus, ever re&s;tle&s;s and bold, they con|&s;idered war as their trade; and were, in con&s;e|quence, taught to con&s;ider victory as a doubt|ful advantage, but courage as a certain good. A nation, however, entirely addicted to war,
<PB N="37" REF="47">
has &s;eldom wanted the imputation of cruel|ty, as tho&s;e terrors which are oppo&s;ed with|out fear, are often inflicted without regret. The Saxons are repre&s;ented as a very cruel na|tion; but, we mu&s;t remember, that their enemies have drawn the picture.</P>
<P>It was upon this people, that Vortigern turned his eyes for &s;uccour again&s;t the Picts and Scots, who&s;e cruelties, perhaps, were &s;till more flagrant. It certainly was not without the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing invitations, that the Saxons deigned to e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e; and we are yet in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the form of their reque&s;t, as left us by Wittichindus, a cotemporary hi&s;torian of &s;ome credit. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Britons, almo&s;t worn out by ho&s;tile inva&s;ions, and har|ra&s;&s;ed by continual incur&s;ions, are humble &s;uppliants to you, mo&s;t valiant Saxons, for &s;uc|cour.

<P>It was no di&s;agreeable circum&s;tance to the&s;e conquerors, to be thus invited into a country upon which they had, for ages before, been
<PB N="38" REF="48">
forming de&s;igns. In con&s;equence, therefore, of Vortigern's &s;olemn invitation, they arrived with fifteen hundred men, under the com|mand of Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a, who were bro|thers, and landed on the i&s;le of Thanet. There they did not long remain inactive; but, be|ing joined by the Briti&s;h forces, they boldly marched again&s;t the Pict's and Scots, who had advanced as far as Lincoln&s;hire, and &s;oon gained a complete victory over them.</P>
<P>Hengi&s;t and Hor&s;a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great credit among their countrymen at home, and had been much celebrated for their valour and the &s;plen|dor of their de&s;cent. They were believed to be &s;prung from Woden, who was wor&s;hipped as a God among this people, and were &s;aid to be no more than the fourth in de&s;cent from him. This report, how fabulous &s;oever, did not a little contribute to encrea&s;e their authority among their a&s;&s;ociates; and being &s;en&s;ible of the fertility of the country to which they came, and the barrenne&s;s of that which they had left behind, they invited over great num|bers of their countrymen to become &s;harers in their new expedition. It was no difficult matter to per&s;uade the Saxons to embrace an enterpri&s;e, which promi&s;ed, at once, an oppor|tunity of di&s;playing their valour, and of reward|ing
<PB N="39" REF="49">
their rapacity. Accordingly,<MILESTONE N="450" UNIT="A.D."> they &s;ent over a fre&s;h &s;upply of five thou&s;and men, who pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;eventeen ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>It was now, but too late, that the Britons began to entertain apprehen&s;ions of their new allies, who&s;e numbers they found augmenting as their &s;ervices became le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. They had long found their chief protection in pa&s;|&s;ive &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and they re&s;olved, upon this occa&s;ion, to bear every encroachment with patient re&s;ignation. But the Saxons being de|termined to come to a rupture with them, ea&s;i|ly found a pretext, in complaining, that their &s;ub&s;idies were ill paid, and their provi&s;ions withdrawn. They, therefore, demanded that the&s;e grievances &s;hould be immediately re|dre&s;&s;ed, otherwi&s;e they would do them&s;elves ju&s;tice; and, in the mean time, they engaged in a treaty with the Picts, whom they had been called in to repre&s;s. The Britons, impelled by the urgency of their calamities, at length took up arms; and having depo&s;ed Vortigern, by who&s;e coun&s;el and vices they were thus redu|ced to an extremity, they put them&s;elves un|der the command of Vortimer, his &s;on. Many were the battles fought between the&s;e enraged nations, their hatred to each other being &s;till more enflamed by the difference of their reli|gion,
<PB N="40" REF="50">
the Britons being all Chri&s;tians, and the Saxons &s;till remaining in a &s;tate of idolatry. There is little to entertain the reader in the narration of battles, where rather ob&s;tinate va|lour than prudent conduct procured the vic|tory; and, indeed, the accounts given us of them are very oppo&s;ite, when de&s;cribed by Bri|ti&s;h and Saxon annali&s;ts. However, the pro|gre&s;s the latter &s;till made in the i&s;land, &s;uffici|ently proves the advantage to have been on their &s;ide; although, in a battle fought at Eglesford, Hor&s;a, the Saxon general, was &s;lain.</P>
<P>But a &s;ingle victory, or even a repetition of &s;ucce&s;s, could avail but little again&s;t an enemy continually reinforced from abroad; for Hen|gi&s;t, now becoming &s;ole commander, and pro|curing con&s;tant &s;upplies from his native coun|try, carried deva&s;tation into the mo&s;t remote corners of Britain. Chiefly anxious to &s;pread the terror of his arms, he &s;pared neither &s;ex, age, or condition, but laid all the country de|&s;olate before him. The prie&s;ts and bi&s;hops found no protection from their &s;acred calling, but were &s;laughtered upon their altars. The people were ma&s;&s;acred in heaps; and &s;ome, chu&s;ing life upon the mo&s;t abject terms, were contented to become &s;laves to the victors. It was about this time, that numbers, de&s;erting
<PB N="41" REF="51">
their native country, fled over to the province of Armorica, &s;ince called Brittany, where they &s;ettled in great numbers, among a people of the &s;ame manners and language with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h hi&s;torians, in order to account for the ea&s;y conque&s;t of their country by the Saxons, a&s;&s;ign their treachery, not le&s;s than their valour, as a principal cau&s;e. They alledge that Vortigern was artfully inveigled into a pa&s;&s;ion for Rowe|na, the daughter of Hengi&s;t; and, in order to marry her, was induced to &s;ettle the fertile pro|vinces of Kent upon her father, from whence the Saxons could never after be removed. It is alledged al&s;o that, upon the death of Vorti|mer, which happened &s;hortly after the victory he obtained at Eglesford, Vortigern his father was rein&s;tated upon the throne. It is added that this weak monarch accepting of a fe&s;tival from Hengi&s;t, three hundred of his nobility were treacherou&s;ly &s;laughtered, and him&s;elf detained as a captive.</P>
<P>Be the&s;e facts as they may, it is certain that the affairs of the Britons gradually declined, and they found but a temporary relief in the valour of one or two of their &s;ucceeding kings. After the death of Vortimer, Ambro&s;ius, a Briton, though of Roman de&s;cent, was inve&s;ted with the command, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure proved
<PB N="42" REF="52">
&s;ucce&s;sful in uniting his countrymen again&s;t the Saxons. He penetrated with his army into the very heart of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and though he fought them with doubtful advantage, yet he re&s;tored the Briti&s;h intere&s;t and dominion. Still, however, Hengi&s;t kept his ground in the country; and inviting over a new tribe of Saxons, under the command of his brother Octa, he &s;ettled them in Northumberland. As for him&s;elf, he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the king|dom of Kent, comprehending al&s;o Middle&s;ex and E&s;&s;ex, fixing his royal &s;eat at Canterbury, and leaving his new-acquired dominions to his po&s;terity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="488" UNIT="A.D."> After the death of Hengi&s;t, &s;everal other German tribes, allured by the &s;ucce&s;s of their countrymen, went over in great numbers. A body of their countrymen, under the conduct of Aella and his three &s;ons,<MILESTONE N="477" UNIT="A.D."> had &s;ome time be|fore laid the foundation of the kingdom of the South Saxons, though not without great oppo|&s;ition and blood&s;hed. This new kingdom in|cluded Surry, Su&s;&s;ex, and the New Fore&s;t: and extended to the frontiers of Kent.</P>
<P>Another tribe of Saxons, under the com|mand of Cerdic and his &s;on Kenric, landed in the we&s;t, and from thence took the name of We&s;t Saxons. The&s;e met a very vigorous op|po&s;ition
<PB N="43" REF="53">
from the natives, but being reinforced from Germany, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their country|men on the i&s;land, they routed the Britons; and although retarded in their progre&s;s by the celebrated king Arthur, they had &s;trength enough to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conque&s;ts they had already made. Cerdic, therefore, with his &s;on Kenric, e&s;tabli&s;hed the third Saxon kingdom in the i&s;land, namely, that of the We&s;t Saxons, including the counties of Hants, Dor&s;et, Wilts, Berks, and the I&s;le of Wight.</P>
<P>It was in oppo&s;ing this Saxon invader that the celebrated prince Arthur acquired his fame. How&s;oever un&s;ucce&s;sful all his valour might have been in the end, yet his name makes &s;o great a figure in the fabulous annals of the times, that &s;ome notice mu&s;t be taken of him. This prince is of &s;uch ob&s;cure origi|nal, that &s;ome authors &s;uppo&s;e him to be the &s;on of king Ambro&s;ius, and others only his nephew; others again affirm that he was a Corni&s;h prince, and &s;on of Gurlois king of that province. However this be, it is certain he was a commander of great valour, and could courage alone repair the mi&s;erable &s;tate of the Britons, his might have been effectual. Ac|cording to Nennius, and the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;|torians,
<PB N="44" REF="54">
he is &s;aid to have wor&s;ted the Saxons in twelve &s;ucce&s;&s;ive battles. In one of the&s;e, namely, that fought at Caerbadon, in Berks, it is a&s;&s;erted that he killed no le&s;s than four hun|dred and forty of the enemy with his own hand. But the Saxons were too numerous and powerful to be extirpated by the de&s;ultory ef|forts of &s;ingle valour; &s;o that a peace, and not conque&s;t, were the immediate fruits of his vic|tories. The enemy therefore &s;till gained ground; and this prince, in the decline of life, had the mortification, from &s;ome dome&s;tic troubles of his own, to be a patient &s;pectator of their encroachments. His fir&s;t wife had been carried off by Melnas, king of Somer&s;et|&s;hire, who detained her a whole year at Gla&s;|tonbury, until Arthur, di&s;covering the place of her retreat, advanced with an army again&s;t the ravi&s;her, and obliged him to give her back, by the mediation of Gildas Albanius. In his &s;e|cond wife, perhaps, he might have been more fortunate, as we have no mention made of her, but it was otherwi&s;e with his third con&s;ort, who was debauched by his own nephew Mordred. This produced a rebellion, in which the king and his traiterous kin&s;man meeting in battle, they &s;lew each other.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="55">In the mean time, while the Saxons were thus gaining ground in the we&s;t, their country|men were not le&s;s active in other parts of the i&s;land.<MILESTONE N="575" UNIT="A.D."> Adventurers &s;till continuing to pour over from Germany, one body of them, under the command of Uffa, &s;eized upon the coun|ties of Cambridge, Suffolk, and Norfolk, and gave their commander the title of King of the Ea&s;t Angles, which was the fourth Saxon kingdom founded in Britain.</P>
<P>Another body of the&s;e adventurers formed a kingdom under the title of Ea&s;t Saxony,<MILESTONE N="585" UNIT="A.D."> or E&s;&s;ex, comprehending E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, and part of Hertford&s;hire. This kingdom, which was di&s;membered from that of Kent, formed the fifth Saxon principality founded in Bri|tain.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Mercia was the &s;ixth which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e fierce invaders, com|prehending all the middle counties, from the banks of the Severn to the frontiers of the two la&s;t named kingdoms.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh and la&s;t kingdom which they obtained was that of Northumberland, one of the mo&s;t powerful and exten&s;ive of them all. This was formed from the union of two &s;maller Saxon kingdoms, the one called Bernicia, con|taining the pre&s;ent county of Northumberland
<PB N="46" REF="56">
and the bi&s;hoprick of Durham; the &s;ubjects of the other, called the Deiri, extending them|&s;elves over Lanca&s;hire and York&s;hire. The&s;e kingdoms were united in the per&s;on of Ethel|frid, king of Northumberland, by the expul|&s;ion of Edwin, his brother-in-law, from the kingdom of the Deiri, and the &s;eizure of his dominions.</P>
<P>In this manner the natives being overpower|ed, or entirely expelled, &s;even kingdoms were e&s;tabli&s;hed in Britain, which have been &s;ince well known by the name of the Saxon Hep|tarchy. The unfortunate Britons having been exhau&s;ted by continual wars, and even worn out by their own victories, were reluctantly compelled to for&s;ake the more fertile parts of the country, and to take refuge in the moun|tainous parts of Wales and Cornwall. All the ve&s;tiges of Roman luxury were now almo&s;t to|tally de&s;troyed by the conquerors, who rather aimed at enjoying the comforts of life than its magnificence. The few natives who were not either ma&s;&s;acred or expelled their habitations, were reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, and employed in cultivating tho&s;e grounds for their new ma&s;ters, which they once claimed as their own.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="57">From this time Briti&s;h and Roman cu&s;toms entirely cea&s;ed in the i&s;land; the language, which had been either Latin or Celtic, was di&s;continued, and the Saxon or Engli&s;h only was &s;poken. The land, before divided into colonies or go|vernments, was cantoned into &s;hires, with Saxon appellations to di&s;tingui&s;h them. The habits of the people in peace, and arms in war, their titles of honour, their laws, and methods of trial by jury, were continued as originally practi&s;ed by the Germans, only with &s;uch alter|ations as encrea&s;ing civilization produced. Conquerors, although they di&s;&s;eminate their own laws and manners, often borrow from the people they &s;ubdue. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance they imitated the Britons in their government, by de&s;potic and hereditary monarchies, while their exemplary cha&s;tity, and their abhorrence of &s;lavery, were quite forgotten.</P>
<P>The Saxons being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the de&s;irable parts of the i&s;land, and having no longer the Britons to contend with, began to quarrel among them&s;elves. A country divided into a number of petty independent principa|lities, mu&s;t ever be &s;ubject to contention, as jealou&s;y and ambition have more frequent in|centives to operate. The wars therefore and revolutions of the&s;e little rival &s;tates were ex|tremely
<PB N="48" REF="58">
numerous, and the accounts of them have &s;welled the hi&s;torian's page. But the&s;e accounts are &s;o confu&s;edly written, the mate|rials &s;o dry, unintere&s;ting, and filled with &s;uch improbable adventures, that a repetition of them can gratify neither the reader's judgment nor curio&s;ity. In&s;tead therefore of entering in|to a detail of tumultuous battles, petty treach|eries, and ob&s;cure &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, it will be more conformable to the pre&s;ent plan, to give &s;ome account of the introduction of Chri&s;tianity among the Saxons, which happened during this dreary period.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion never &s;uffered more per&s;ecution than it underwent in Britain from the barbarity of the Saxon pagans, who burn|ed all the churches, &s;tained the altars with the blood of the clergy, and ma&s;&s;acred all tho&s;e whom they found profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity. This deplorable &s;tate of religion in Britain was fir&s;t taken into con&s;ideration by St. Gregory, who was then pope, and he undertook to &s;end mi&s;|&s;ionaries thither. It is &s;aid, that, before his elevation to the papal chair, he chanced one day to pa&s;s through the &s;lave-market at Rome, and perceiving &s;ome children of great beauty who were &s;et up for &s;ale, he enquired about their country, and finding they were Engli&s;h
<PB N="49" REF="59">
pages, he is &s;aid to have cried out, in the La|tin language, <HI>Non Angli &s;ed Angeli forent, &s;i e&s;&s;ent Chri&s;tiani</HI>; They would not be Engli&s;h, but Angels, had they been Chri&s;tians. From that time he was &s;truck with an ardent de&s;ire to convert that unenlightened nation, and actual|ly embarked in a &s;hip for Britain, when his pious intentions were fru&s;trated by his being detained at Rome by the populace, who loved him. He did not however lay a&s;ide his pious re&s;olution; for, having &s;ucceeded to the papal chair, he ordered a monk, named Augu&s;tine, and others of the &s;ame fraternity, to undertake the mi&s;&s;ion into Britain. It was not without &s;ome reluctance that the&s;e reve|rend men undertook &s;o dangerous a ta&s;k; but &s;ome favourable circum&s;tances in Britain &s;eem|ed providentially to prepare the way for their arrival. Ethelbert, king of Kent, in his fa|ther's life-time had married Bertha, the only daughter of Coribert, king of Paris, one of the de&s;cendants of Clovis, king of Gaul. But before he was admitted to this alliance, he was obliged to &s;tipulate that this prince&s;s &s;hould enjoy the free exerci&s;e of her religion, which was that of Chri&s;tianity. She was there|fore attended to Canterbury, the place of her re&s;idence, by Luidhard, a Gauli&s;h prelate, who officiated in a church dedicated to St. Martin,
<PB N="50" REF="60">
which had been built by the Romans, near the walls of Canterbury. The exemplary conduct and powerful preaching of this primitive bi|&s;hop, added to the queen's learning and zeal, made very &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions upon the king, as well as the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects, in favour of Chri&s;tianity. The general reception of this holy religion all over the continent might al&s;o contribute to di&s;po&s;e the minds of the&s;e idola|ters for its admi&s;&s;ion, and make the attempt le&s;s dangerous than Augu&s;tine and his a&s;&s;ociates at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This pious monk, upon his fir&s;t landing in the I&s;le of Thanet, &s;ent one of his interpreters to the Kenti&s;h king, declaring he was come from Rome with offers of eternal &s;alvation. In the mean time he and his followers lay in the open air, that they might not, according to the belief of the times, by entering a Saxon hou&s;e, &s;ubject them&s;elves to the power of heathen necromancy. The king immediate|ly ordered them to be furni&s;hed with all ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and even vi&s;ited them, though with|out declaring him&s;elf as yet in their favour. Augu&s;tine, however, encouraged by this fa|vourable reception, and now &s;eeing a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, proceeded with redoubled zeal to preach the go&s;pel, and even endeavoured to call in the aid of miracles to enforce his ex|hortations.
<PB N="51" REF="61">
So much a&s;&s;iduity, together with the earne&s;tne&s;s of his addre&s;s, the au&s;terity of his life and the example of his followers, at la&s;t powerfully operated. The king openly e&s;pou&s;ed the Chri&s;tian religion, while his example wrought &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully on his &s;ubjects, that numbers of them came voluntarily to be baptiz|ed, their mi&s;&s;ioner loudly declaring again&s;t any coercive means towards their conver&s;ion. The heathen temples being purified, were changed to places of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, and &s;uch churches as had been &s;uffered to decay were repaired. The more to facilitate the reception of Chri&s;tianity, the pope enjoined his mi&s;&s;ioner to remove the pagan idols, but not to throw down the altars, ob&s;erving, that the people would be allured to frequent tho&s;e places, which they had formerly been accu&s;tomed to revere. He al&s;o permitted him to indulge the people in tho&s;e fea&s;ts and chearful entertainments which they had been formerly accu&s;tomed to celebrate near the places of their idolatrous wor&s;hip. The people thus exchanged their ancient opinions with readine&s;s, &s;ince they found them&s;elves indulged in tho&s;e innocent relaxations which are only immoral when carried to an exce&s;s.

churches, and his a&s;&s;ociates, having &s;pread them&s;elves over all the country, completed that conver&s;ion which was &s;o happily begun.</P>
<P>The kingdom of the heptarchy which next embraced the Chri&s;tian faith was that of Northumberland, at that time the mo&s;t power|ful of the re&s;t: Edwin, a wi&s;e, brave, and active prince, then king of the country, was married to Ethelburga, the daughter of Ethelbert, who had been &s;o lately converted. This prince&s;s, emulating the glory of her mo|ther, who had been the in&s;trument of convert|ing her hu&s;band and his &s;ubjects to Chri&s;tiani|ty, carried Paulinus, a learned bi&s;hop, with her into Northumberland, having previou&s;ly &s;tipulated for the free exerci&s;e of her religion. Edwin, whom his queen uncea&s;ingly &s;olicited. to embrace Chri&s;tianity, for a long time he&s;i|tated on the propo&s;al, willing to examine its doctrines before he declared in their favour. Accordingly he held &s;everal conferences with Paulinus, di&s;puted with his coun&s;ellors, medi|tated alone, and, after a &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, de|clared him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian. The high prie&s;t al&s;o of the pagan &s;uper&s;tition &s;oon after declar|ing him&s;elf a convert to the arguments of Pau|linus, and the whole body of the people una|nimou&s;ly followed their example.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="63">The authority of Edwin, who was thus converted, &s;oon after prevailed upon Earp|wold, the king of the Ea&s;t Angles, to embrace Chri&s;tianity. This monarch, however, after the death of Edwin, relap&s;ed into his former idolatry, at the per&s;ua&s;ion of his wife. But upon his decea&s;e, Sigebert, his half-brother, who had been educated in France, re&s;tored Chri&s;tianity, and introduced learning among the Angles.</P>
<P>Mercia, the mo&s;t powerful kingdom of all the Saxon heptarchy, owed its conver&s;ion, like the former, to a woman. The wife of Peada, who was the daughter of O&s;wy, king of Northumberland, having been bred in the Chri&s;tian faith, employed her influence with &s;ucce&s;s in converting her hu&s;band and his &s;ub|jects. But it &s;eems the new religion was at|tended with &s;mall influence on the manners of that fierce people, as we find Otto, one of their new converted kings, in a few reigns after, treacherou&s;ly de&s;troying Ethelbert, king of the Ea&s;t Angles, at an entertainment to which he had been invited. However, to make a|tonement for this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, we find him paying great court to the clergy, giving the tenth of his goods to the church, and making a pilgrimage to Rome, where his riches pro|cured
<PB N="54" REF="64">
him the papal ab&s;olution. It was upon this occa&s;ion, the better to ingratiate him&s;elf with the pope, that he engaged to pay him a yearly donation for the &s;upport of an Engli&s;h college at Rome; and, in order to rai&s;e the &s;um, he impo&s;ed a tax of a penny on each hou&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thirty pence a year. This impo&s;ition being afterwards generally levied throughout the kingdom, went by the name of Peter-pence, and in &s;ucceeding times gave ri&s;e to many eccle&s;ia&s;tical abu&s;es.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of E&s;&s;ex, Sebert, who was nephew to Ethelbert, king of Kent, of who&s;e conver&s;ion we have already made mention, was al&s;o prevailed upon by his uncle to embrace the Chri&s;tian religion. His &s;ons, however, re|lap&s;ed into idolatry, and bani&s;hed Melitus, the Chri&s;tian bi&s;hop, from their territories, be|cau&s;e he refu&s;ed to let them eat the white bread which was di&s;tributed at the commu|nion. But Chri&s;tianity was re&s;tored two or three reigns after, by Sigebert the Good; and &s;uch was the influence of its doctrines upon Offa, the third in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from him, that he went upon a pilgrimage to Rome, and &s;hut him&s;elf up during the re&s;t of his life in a cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="65">We know but little of the propagation of Chri&s;tianity in the kingdom of Su&s;&s;ex; but this being the &s;malle&s;t of all the Saxon heptarchy, it is probable that it was governed in its opi|nions by &s;ome of its more powerful neigh|bours. It is &s;aid, that, during the reign of Ci&s;&s;a, one of its kings, which continued &s;e|venty-&s;ix years, the kingdom fell into a total dependence upon that of We&s;&s;ex, and to this it is probable that it owed its con|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The kingdom of We&s;&s;ex, which in the end &s;wallowed up all the re&s;t, de&s;erves our more particular attention. This principality, which, as has been already related, was founded by Cerdic, was, of all the Saxon e&s;tabli&s;hments in Britain, the mo&s;t active and warlike. The great oppo&s;ition the invaders of this province originally met from the natives, whom they expelled, not without much blood&s;hed, &s;erved to carry their martial &s;pirit to the highe&s;t pitch. Cerdic was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Kenric, and he by Ceanhin, a prince more ambitious and enterprizing than either of the former. He had, by waging continual war again&s;t the Bri|tons, added a great part of the counties of Devon and Somer&s;et to his dominions; and, not &s;atisfied with conque&s;ts over his natural enemies, he attacked the Saxons them&s;elves,
<PB N="56" REF="66">
till, becoming terrible to all, he provoked a general confederacy again&s;t him. This com|bination took place; &s;o that he was at la&s;t ex|pelled the throne, and died in exile and mi|&s;ery. His two &s;ons &s;ucceeded; and, after a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of two more, Kynegils inherited the crown. This prince embraced Chri&s;tianity through the per&s;ua&s;ion of O&s;wald, the king of Northumberland, his &s;on-in-law. After &s;ome &s;ucceeding ob&s;cure reigns, Ceodwalla mounted the throne, an enterprizing, warlike, and &s;uc|ce&s;sful prince. He &s;ubdued entirely the king|dom of Su&s;&s;ex, and annexed it to his own do|minions. He made al&s;o &s;ome attempts upon Kent, but was repul&s;ed with vigour. Ina, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was the mo&s;t renowned and illu&s;|trious of all the kings who reigned in England during the heptarchy. This monarch inherit|ed the military virtues of Ceodwalla, but im|proved by policy, ju&s;tice, and prudence. He made war upon the Britons, who yet remained in Somer&s;et, and having totally &s;ubdued that province, he treated the vanqui&s;hed with a hu|manity hitherto unknown to the Saxon con|querors. In le&s;s than a year after he mounted the throne of We&s;&s;ex, he was declared mo|narch of the Anglo Saxons, a remarkable proof of the great character he had acquired. He compiled a body of laws, which &s;erved as the
<PB N="57" REF="67">
ground-work of tho&s;e which were afterwards publi&s;hed by Alfred. He al&s;o a&s;&s;embled a general council of the clergy, in which it was determined, that all churches, mona&s;teries, and places of religious wor&s;hip which had gone to ruin or decay, &s;hould be rebuilt and repair|ed. At length, after a di&s;tingui&s;hed reign of thirty-&s;even years, in the decline of life, he made a pilgrimage to Rome; and on his re|turn home, &s;hut him&s;elf up in a cloi&s;ter, where he died. To him &s;ucceeded O&s;wald, Cu|dred, Sigebert, Cenulph, and Brithric; all the&s;e claiming the crown, not entirely by here|ditary right, nor yet totally rejecting their fa|mily preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>It was in the reign of the la&s;t-named mo|narch, that Egbert, a grand-nephew of the late king Ina, began to grow very popular a|mong the We&s;t Saxons, both on account of his family and private merit. Being &s;en&s;ible, how|ever, of the danger of popularity, under &s;uch a jealous monarch as Brithric, he withdrew &s;e|cretly into France, to the court of Charle|magne, at that time the mo&s;t poli&s;hed prince of Europe. This was a &s;chool, in which young Egbert failed not to make a rapid proficiency; and he &s;oon acquired &s;uch accompli&s;hments, both in arts and arms, as rai&s;ed him great|ly
<PB N="58" REF="68">
&s;uperior to any of his countrymen at home.</P>
<P>Nor was it long before this prince had an opportunity of di&s;playing his natural and ac|quired talents to advantage. For Brithric be|ing poi&s;oned by his wife Eadburga, the nobi|lity recalled him from France, in order to a&s;|cend the throne of his ance&s;tors. About that time al&s;o,<MILESTONE N="799" UNIT="A.D."> a fortunate concurrence of events &s;eemed to prepare the way for his becoming &s;ole monarch of the whole country. In all the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, an exact rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was but little regarded; while, at the &s;ame time, family preten&s;ions were not laid totally a&s;ide. Every per&s;on of the colla|teral line had as good a right to a&s;&s;ert his right as tho&s;e who claimed by direct de&s;cent; &s;o that the reigning monarch was under con|tinual apprehen&s;ions from the princes of the blood, whom he was taught to con&s;ider as ri|vals, and who&s;e death alone could en&s;ure him tranquility. From this fatal cau&s;e, together with the pa&s;&s;ion princes then had of retiring to mona&s;teries, and the opinion of merit attend|ing the pre&s;ervation of cha&s;tity, even in a mar|ried &s;tate; from the&s;e cau&s;es, I &s;ay, the royal families had been entirely extingui&s;hed in all the kingdoms, except that of We&s;&s;ex. Thus,
<PB N="59" REF="69">
Egbert was the only &s;urviving de&s;cendant of tho&s;e conquerors, who boa&s;ted their de&s;cent from Woden; and con&s;equently, be&s;ide his per&s;onal merit, he had hereditary preten&s;ions to the throne of the united kingdoms.</P>
<P>It is indeed probable, that he had already planned the union of the Heptarchy; but, in order to avert the &s;u&s;picions of the neighbour|ing &s;tates, he attacked the Britons in Cornwall, and continued to act as mediator among the Saxon princes, who&s;e differences were become almo&s;t irreconcileable. His moderation in the&s;e good offices, the prudence he manife&s;ted in his own government, and his known capa|city in the affairs of war and peace, procured him &s;uch a degree of reputation, that he was &s;oon con&s;idered as chief of the Saxon Hep|tarchy.</P>
<P>But his ambition was not to be &s;atisfied with a mere nominal &s;uperiority; he &s;till aim|ed at breaking down all di&s;tinctions, and unit|ing the&s;e petty &s;tates into one great and flouri&s;h|ing kingdom. The king of Mercia was the fir&s;t who furni&s;hed him with a pretext for re|covering the part of his dominions, which had formerly been di&s;membered by that &s;tate. Beornult, the monarch of that country, who had already almo&s;t obtained the &s;overeignty
<PB N="60" REF="70">
over the Heptarchy, taking advantage of Eg|bert's ab&s;ence, who was employed in quelling the Britons, invaded his dominions with a nu|merous army, compo&s;ed of the flower of his country. Egbert was not remi&s;s in marching to oppo&s;e him, with a body of troops le&s;s nu|merous than tho&s;e of Beornulf, but more brave and re&s;olute. Both armies met at Wilton, and a battle en&s;uing, the Mercians were defeated with terrible &s;laughter.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the victor pur&s;ued his conque&s;t into the enemies' country, he di&s;patched his elde&s;t &s;on, Ethelwolf, with an army, into the kingdom of Kent, who &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole nation, and expelled Baldred, their monarch, to whom his &s;ubjects had paid a very unwilling obedience. The Ea&s;t Saxons al&s;o, and part of Surry, di&s;|&s;atisfied with their &s;ubjection to the Mercians, readily &s;ubmited to Egbert; nor were the Ea&s;t Angles backward in &s;ending amba&s;&s;adors to crave his protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, again&s;t that nation who&s;e yoke they had for &s;ome time en|dured, and were re&s;olved no longer to bear. The Mercian king attempting to repre&s;s their defection, was defeated, and &s;lain: and two years after, Ludecan, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, met with the &s;ame fate. Withalf, one of their eolder|men,
<PB N="61" REF="71">
&s;oon after put him&s;elf at their head, but being driven from province to province by the victorious arms of Egbert, he was, at la&s;t, obliged to take &s;helter in the abbey of Croy|land, while Egbert made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole kingdom of Mercia. However, in or|der to accu&s;tom that people to his dominion, he permitted Withalf to govern the kingdom as a va&s;&s;al, and tributary under him; thus, at once, &s;atisfying his ambition, and flattering the people with an appearance of their former go|vernment.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Northumberland was the la&s;t that &s;ubmitted to his authority. This &s;tate had been long harra&s;&s;ed by civil wars and u&s;ur|pations: all order had been de&s;troyed among the people, and the kingdom was weakened to &s;uch a degree, that it was in no condition to with&s;tand &s;uch an invader as Egbert. The inhabitants, therefore, unable to re&s;i&s;t his power, and de&s;irous of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome e&s;ta|bli&s;hed form of government, very chearfully &s;ent deputies, who &s;ubmitted to his authority, and expre&s;&s;ed their allegiance to him as their &s;overeign. By this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, all the king|doms of the Heptarchy were united under his command; but, to give &s;plendour to his au|thority, a general council of the clergy and
<PB N="62" REF="72">
laity was &s;ummoned at Winche&s;ter, where he was &s;olemnly crowned king of England, by which name the united kingdom was thence|forward called.</P>
<P>Thus, about four hundred years after the fir&s;t arrival of the Saxons in Britain, all their petty &s;ettlements were united into one great &s;tate,<MILESTONE N="827" UNIT="A.D."> and nothing offered, but pro&s;pects of peace, &s;ecurity, and increa&s;ing refinement. At this period, namely, about the eighth cen|tury, the arts and &s;ciences, which had been be|fore only known to the Greeks and Romans, were di&s;&s;eminated over Europe, where they were &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the people above mere barbarians; but yet lo&s;t all their native &s;plendor in the tran&s;plantation. The Eng|li&s;h, at this time, might be con&s;idered as po|lite, if compared to the naked Britons at the inva&s;ion of Cae&s;ar. The hou&s;es, furniture, cloaths, eating, and all the real luxuries of &s;en&s;e, were almo&s;t as great then as they have been &s;ince. But the people were incapable of &s;entimental plea&s;ure. All the learning of the times was confined among the clergy; and little improvement could be expected from their rea&s;onings, &s;ince it was one of their te|nets to di&s;card the light of rea&s;on. An eclip&s;e was even by their hi&s;torians talked of as an
<PB N="63" REF="73">
omen of threatened calamities; and magic was not only believed, but &s;ome actually believed them&s;elves magicians. The clergy them&s;elves were not aver&s;e to the&s;e opinions, as &s;uch, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;erved to encrea&s;e their authority. Indeed, the reverence for the clergy was car|ried &s;o high, that if a per&s;on appeared in a &s;a|cerdotal habit on the highway, the people flocked round him, and with all the marks of profound re&s;pect, received every word he ut|tered as an oracle. From this blind attach|ment, the &s;ocial and even the military vir|tues began to decline among them. The re|verence towards &s;aints and reliques &s;erved to &s;upplant the adoration of the &s;upreme Being. Mona&s;tic ob&s;ervances were e&s;teemed more me|ritorious than active virtues; and bounty to the church atoned for all the violences done to &s;ociety. The nobility, who&s;e duty it was to pre&s;erve the military &s;pirit from declining, began to prefer the &s;loth and &s;ecurity of a cloi|&s;ter, to the tumult and glory of war; and the&s;e rewards, which &s;hould have gone to en|courage the &s;oldier, were lavi&s;hed in main|taining the credulous indolence of mona&s;tic &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

<P>IT might have been rea&s;onably expected, that a wi&s;e and fortunate prince, at the head of &s;o great a kingdom, and &s;o united and nu|merous a people as the Engli&s;h then were, &s;hould not only have enjoyed the fruits of peace and quiet, but left felicity to &s;ucceeding generations. The inhabitants of the &s;everal provinces, tired out with mutual di&s;&s;en|tions,
<PB N="65" REF="75">
&s;eemed to have lo&s;t all de&s;ire of revolt|ing: the race of their ancient kings was ex|tinct, and none now remained, but a prince who de&s;erved their allegiance, both by the me|rit of his &s;ervices, and the &s;plendor of his birth. Yet, &s;uch is the in&s;tability of human affairs, and the weakne&s;s of man's be&s;t conjec|ture, that Egbert was hardly &s;ettled on his united throne, when both he and his &s;ubjects began to be alarmed at the approach of new and unknown enemies, and the i&s;land expo&s;ed to fre&s;h inva&s;ions.</P>
<P>About this time,<MILESTONE N="819" UNIT="A.D."> a mighty &s;warm of tho&s;e nations, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the countries bor|dering on the Baltic, began, under the names of Danes and Normans, to infe&s;t the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Europe; and to fill all places, where|ever they came, with &s;laughter and deva&s;ta|tion. The&s;e were, in fact, no other than the ance&s;tors of the very people whom they came to de&s;poil, and might be con&s;idered as the ori|ginal &s;tock from whence the numerous co|lonies that infe&s;ted Britain, had migrated &s;ome centuries before. The Normans fell upon the northern coa&s;ts of France; the Danes chiefly levelled their fury again&s;t Eng|land, their fir&s;t appearance being when Brithric was king of We&s;&s;ex. It was then,<MILESTONE N="787" UNIT="A.D."> that a &s;mall
<PB N="66" REF="76">
body of them landed on the coa&s;ts of that kingdom, with a view of learning the &s;tate of the country; and having committed &s;ome &s;mall depredations, fled to their &s;hips for &s;afe|ty. About &s;even years after this fir&s;t attempt, they made a de&s;cent upon the kingdom of Northumberland, where they pilaged a mo|na&s;tery, but their fleet being &s;hattered by a &s;torm, they were defeated by the inhabitants, and put to the &s;word. It was not till about five years after the acce&s;&s;ion of Egbert, that their inva&s;ions became truly formidable. From that time they continued, with uncea&s;ing ferocity, until the whole kingdom was reduced to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful bondage.</P>
<P>As the Saxons had utterly neglected their naval power &s;ince their fir&s;t &s;ettlement in Bri|tain; the Danes, who &s;ucceeded them in the empire of the &s;ea, found no difficulty in land|ing upon the i&s;le of Sheppey, in Kent, which they ravaged, returning to their &s;hips loaden with the &s;poil. Their next attempt, the year en&s;uing, was at the mouth of the Tyne, where they landed a body of fifteen thou&s;and men, that made good their ground again&s;t the efforts of Egbert; who, after a battle, was obliged to draw off his forces by night. Within two years after, they landed in
<PB N="67" REF="77">
Cornwall; and being joined by the Britons there, they advanced towards the borders of Devon&s;hire, where they were totally routed by Egbert, in a pitched battle, at Heng&s;down|hill, near Kellington. By this victory, he &s;e|cured the kingdom from inva&s;ion for &s;ome time; but his death &s;eemed to put a period to the &s;ucce&s;s of his countrymen, and to invite the enemy to renew their deva&s;tations with impunity.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceeded by Ethelwolf, his &s;on, who had neither the vigour nor the abilities of his father. This prince had been educated in a cloi&s;ter, and had actually taken orders during the life of his elder brother; but, upon his death, he received a di&s;pen&s;ation to quit the monki&s;h habit, and to marry. He was &s;carcely &s;ettled on his throne, when a fleet of Dani&s;h ravagers, con|&s;i&s;ting of thirty-three &s;ail, landed at Southamp|ton; but were repul&s;ed, though not without great &s;laughter on both &s;ides. However, no de|feat could repre&s;s the ob&s;tinacy, nor no difficul|ties daunt the courage of the&s;e fierce invaders, who &s;till per&s;evered in their de&s;cents, and, year after year, made inroads into the country, mark|ing their way with pillage, &s;laughter, and de|&s;olation. Though often repul&s;ed, they al|ways obtained their end, of &s;poiling the coun|try,
<PB N="68" REF="78">
and carrying the plunder away. It was their method to avoid coming, if po&s;&s;ible, to a general engagement; but &s;cattering them|&s;elves over the face of the country, they car|ried away, indi&s;criminately, as well the inhabi|tants them&s;elves, as all their moveable po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions. If the military force of the country was drawn out again&s;t them, the invaders either &s;tood their ground, if &s;trong enough to oppo&s;e; or retreated to their &s;hips, if incap|able of re&s;i&s;tance. Thus, by making con|tinual and repeated de&s;cents, every part of England was kept in con&s;tant alarm, every county fearful of giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the next, as its own &s;afety was in danger. From this general calamity, the prie&s;ts and monks were no way exempted; they were rather the chief objects on whom the&s;e Dani&s;h idolaters wreak|ed their re&s;entment.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of fluctuating &s;ucce&s;s, affairs continued for &s;ome time, the Engli&s;h often repelling, and as often being repul&s;ed by their fierce invaders; till, at length, the Danes re&s;olved upon making a &s;ettlement in the coun|try,<MILESTONE N="852" UNIT="A.D."> and landing on the i&s;le of Thanet, &s;tationed them&s;elves there. In this place they kept their ground, notwith&s;tanding a bloody victory gained over them by Ethelwolf. From thence,
<PB N="69" REF="79">
they &s;oon after removed to the i&s;le of Sheppey, which they con&s;idered as more convenient for their tumultuary depredations.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Ethelwolf, the wretched monarch of the country, in&s;tead of exerting his &s;trength to repel the&s;e invaders, was more &s;olicitous to obey the dictates of monki&s;h &s;u|per&s;tition. In order to manife&s;t his devotion to the pope, he &s;ent his &s;on Alfred to Rome, to receive confirmation from his holine&s;s; and, not &s;atisfied with this te&s;timony of his zeal, un|dertook a pilgrimage thither in per&s;on. He pa&s;&s;ed a twelvemonth in that city, and gained no &s;mall applau&s;e for his devotion, which he te&s;tified by his great liberality to the church. In his return home, he married Judith, daugh|ter to the emperor Charles the Bald; but on his landing in his own dominions, he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find his title to the crown di&s;puted.</P>
<P>His &s;econd &s;on, Ethelbald, upon the death of his elder brother, perceiving the mi&s;erable &s;tate to which the kingdom was reduced, by the king's ill timed &s;uper&s;titions, formed a con|&s;piracy to expel him from the throne The people &s;eemed equally divided between the claims of the father and &s;on, &s;o that a bloody civil war &s;eemed likely to complete the picture of the calamities of the times. A divi&s;ion of the
<PB N="70" REF="80">
kingdom at length terminated the di&s;pute; the king was content with the ea&s;tern part of the monarchy, while his &s;on was appointed to govern the we&s;tern, which was the mo&s;t power|ful, and the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger.</P>
<P>Having come to this agreement, a council was &s;ummoned of the &s;tates of the kingdom; and, be&s;ides the ratification of this grant, a tythe of all the produce of the land was &s;ettled upon the clergy.</P>
<P>Ethelwolf lived only two years after this agreement; leaving, by will, the kingdom &s;hared between his two elde&s;t &s;ons, Ethelbald and Ethelbert; the we&s;t being con&s;igned to the former, the ea&s;t to the latter. The reign of Ethelbald was of no long continuance; however, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, he crowded a number of vices &s;ufficient to render his name odious to po&s;te|rity. He married Judith, his own mother-in-law, and was, not without great difficulty, prevailed upon to divorce her. The reign of his brother was of longer duration; and, as we are told, was in every re&s;pect more meritorious. Neverthele&s;s, the kingdom was &s;till infe&s;ted by the Danes, who committed great outrages.</P>
<P>This prince was &s;ucceeded by his brother E|thelred, a brave prince, but who&s;e valour was in|&s;ufficient to repre&s;s the Dani&s;h incur&s;ions. In

the&s;e exploits, he was always a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his younger brother, Alfred, afterwards &s;urnamed the Great, who &s;acrificed all private re&s;ent|ment to the public good, having been depriv|ed by the king of a large patrimony. It was during this prince's reign, that the Danes, pe|netrating into Mercia, took up their win|ter quarters at Nottingham; from whence, they were not di&s;lodged without difficulty. Their next &s;tation was at Reading, from whence they infe&s;ted the country with their excur&s;ions. The king, attended by his bro|ther Alfred, marched at the head of the We&s;t Saxons again&s;t them; there, after many reci|procations of &s;ucce&s;s, the king died of a wound which he received in battle, and left to his bro|ther Alfred, the inheritance of a kingdom that was now reduced to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more deplorable than the &s;tate of the country when Alfred came to the throne. The Danes had already &s;ubdued Northumberland and Ea&s;t Anglia, and had penetrated into the very heart of We&s;&s;ex. The Mercians were united again&s;t him; the depen|dence upon the other provinces of the empire was but precarious: the lands lay uncultivated, through fears of continual incur&s;ions; and all the churches and mona&s;teries were burned to the
<PB N="72" REF="82">
ground. In this terrible &s;ituation of affairs, nothing appeared but objects of terror, and every hope was lo&s;t in de&s;pair. The wi&s;dom and virtues of one man were found &s;ufficient to bring back happine&s;s, &s;ecurity, and order; and all the calamities of the times found redre&s;s from Alfred.</P>
<P>This prince &s;eemed born not only to defend his bleeding country, but even to adorn humanity. He had given very early in&s;tances of tho&s;e great virtues which after|wards adorned his reign; and was anointed by pope Leo as future king, when he was &s;ent by his father for his education to Rome. On his return from thence, he became every day more the object of his father's fond affec|tions; and that, perhaps, was the rea&s;on why his education was at fir&s;t neglected. He had attain|ed the age of twelve, before he was made ac|quainted with the lowe&s;t elements of literature; but hearing &s;ome Saxon poems read, which recounted the prai&s;e of heroes, his whole mind was rou&s;ed, not only to obtain a &s;imilitude of glory, but al&s;o to be able to tran&s;mit that glory to po&s;terity. Encouraged by the queen, his mother, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a penetrating genius, he &s;oon learned to read the&s;e compo&s;itions, and proceeded from thence to a knowledge of Latin
<PB N="73" REF="83">
authors, who directed his ta&s;te, and rectified his ambition.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce come to the crown, when he was obliged to oppo&s;e the Danes, who had &s;eized Wilton, and were exerci&s;ing their u&s;ual ravages on the countries around. He marched again&s;t them with the few troops he could a&s;|&s;emble on a &s;udden, and a de&s;perate battle was fought, to the di&s;advantage of the Engli&s;h. But it was not in the power of misfortune to abate the king's diligence, though it repre&s;&s;ed his power to do good. He was in a little time enabled to hazard another engagement; &s;o that the enemy, dreading his courage and activity, propo&s;ed terms of peace, which he did not think proper to refu&s;e. They had by this treaty agreed to relinqui&s;h the kingdom; but, in&s;tead of complying with their engagements, they only removed from one place to another, burning and de&s;troying wherever they came.</P>
<P>Alfred, thus oppo&s;ed to an enemy whom no &s;tationary force could re&s;i&s;t, nor no treaty could bind, found him&s;elf unable to repel the efforts of tho&s;e ravagers, who from all quarters invaded him. New &s;warms of the enemy arriv|ed every year upon the coa&s;t, and fre&s;h inva&s;ions were &s;till projected. It was in vain that Alfred pur&s;ued them, &s;traitened their quarters, and
<PB N="74" REF="84">
compelled them to treaties; they broke every league; and continuing their attacks with un|abated per&s;everance, at length totally di&s;pirit|ed his army, and induced his &s;uper&s;titious &s;ol|diers to believe them&s;elves abandoned by hea|ven, &s;ince it thus permitted the outrages of the fierce idolaters with impunity. Some of them therefore left their country, and retired into Wales, or fled to the continent. Others &s;ubmitted to the conquerors, and purcha&s;ed their lives by their freedom. In this univer&s;al defection, Alfred vainly attempted to remind them of the duty they owed their country and their king; but finding his remon&s;trances inef|fectual, he was obliged to give way to the wretched nece&s;&s;ity of the times. Accordingly, relinqui&s;hing the en&s;igns of his dignity, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing his &s;ervants, he dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a pea&s;ant, and lived for &s;ome time in the hou&s;e of an herd&s;man, who had been en|tru&s;ted with the care of his cattle. In this manner, though abandoned by the world, and fearing an enemy in every quarter, &s;till he re|&s;olved to continue in his country, to catch the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ions for bringing it relief. In his &s;olitary retreat, which was in the county of Somer&s;et, at the confluence of the rivers Parret and Thone, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with mu&s;ic, and
<PB N="75" REF="85">
&s;upported his humble lot with the hopes of better fortune. It is &s;aid, that, one day, being commanded by the herd&s;man's wife, who was ignorant of his quality, to take care of &s;ome cakes which were baking by the fire, he hap|pened to let them burn, for which &s;he &s;everely upbraided him for neglect.</P>
<P>Previous to his retirement, Alfred had con|certed mea&s;ures for a&s;&s;embling a few tru&s;ty friends, whenever an opportunity &s;hould offer of annoying the enemy, who were now in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the country. This cho&s;en band, &s;till faithful to their monarch, took &s;helter in the fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes of Somer&s;et, and from thence made occa&s;ional irruptions upon &s;trag|gling parties of the enemy. Their &s;ucce&s;s, in this rapacious and dreary method of living, en|couraged many more to join their &s;ociety, till at length &s;ufficiently augmented, they repaired to their monarch, who had by that time been reduced by famine to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>Mean while, Ubba, the chief of the Da|ni&s;h commanders, carried terror over the whole land, and now ravaged the country of Wales without oppo&s;ition. The only place where he found re&s;i&s;tance was, in his return, from the ca&s;tle of Kenwith, into which the earl of Devon&s;hire had retired with a &s;mall body of
<PB N="76" REF="86">
troops. This gallant &s;oldier finding him&s;elf un|able to &s;u&s;tain a &s;iege, and knowing the danger of &s;urrendering to a perfidious enemy, was re|&s;olved, by one de&s;perate effort, to &s;ally out and force his way through the be&s;iegers, &s;word in hand. The propo&s;al was embraced by all his followers, while the Danes, &s;ecure in their numbers, and in their contempt of the enemy, were not only routed with great &s;laughter, but Ubba, their general, was &s;lain.</P>
<P>This victory once more re&s;tored courage to the di&s;pirited Saxons; and Alfred, taking ad|vantage of their favourable di&s;po&s;ition, pre|pared to animate them to a vigorous exertion of their &s;uperiority. He &s;oon therefore ap|prized them of the place of his retreat, and in|&s;tructed them to be ready with all their &s;trength at a minute's warning. But &s;till none was found who would undertake to give intelligence of the forces and po&s;ture of the enemy. Not know|ing, therefore, a per&s;on in whom to confide, he undertook this dangerous ta&s;k him&s;elf. In the &s;imple dre&s;s of a &s;hepherd, with an harp in his hand, he entered the Dani&s;h camp, tried all his arts to plea&s;e, and was &s;o much ad|mired, that he was brought even into the pre|&s;ence of Guthrum, the Dani&s;h prince, with whom he remained &s;ome days. There he re|marked
<PB N="77" REF="87">
the &s;upine &s;ecurity of the Danes, their contempt of the Engli&s;h, their negligence in foraging and plundering, and their di&s;&s;olute wa&s;ting of &s;uch ill-gotten booty. Having made his ob&s;ervations, he returned to his retreat, and detaching proper emi&s;&s;aries among his &s;ubjects, appointed them to meet him in arms in the fo|re&s;t of Selwood, a &s;ummon which they glad|ly obeyed.</P>
<P>It was again&s;t the mo&s;t unguarded quarter of the enemy that Alfred made his mo&s;t violent attack, while the Danes, &s;urprized to behold an army of Engli&s;h, whom they con&s;idered as totally &s;ubdued, made but a faint re&s;i&s;tance, notwith&s;tanding the &s;uperiority of their num|ber. They were routed with great &s;laughter; and, though &s;uch as e&s;caped fled for refuge into a fortified camp in the neighbourhood, yet, being unprovided for a &s;iege, in le&s;s than a fortnight they were compelled to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. By the conqueror's permi&s;&s;ion,<MILESTONE N="876" UNIT="A.D."> tho&s;e who did not chu&s;e to embrace Chri&s;ti|anity embarked for Flanders, under the com|mand of one of their generals called Ha&s;tings. Gothrum, their prince, became a convert, with thirty of his nobles, and the king him&s;elf an|&s;wered for him at the font.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="88">Of the Danes who had enli&s;ted with Ha&s;|tings, a part returned, contrary to agreement, once more to ravage that country where they had been &s;o mercifully &s;pared, and landing on the coa&s;ts of Kent, advanced towards Roche&s;|ter, in hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing that city. They were &s;oon, however, deterred from proceeding, by hearing that Alfred was upon his march to oppo&s;e them. That &s;uch depredations might be prevent|ed for the future, this monarch equipped a &s;trong fleet of his own, with which he attacked and de&s;troyed &s;ixteen of their ve&s;&s;els in the port of Harwich. There was now but the port of London open to the invaders, and as that city was but weakly garri&s;oned, he &s;oon reduced it to capitulation. Having augmented its forti|fications, and embelli&s;hed it with a number of new edifices, he delivered it in charge to his &s;on-in law, Ethelred, and thus &s;ecured the whole country from foreign danger.</P>
<P>Alfred had now attained the meridian of glory; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater extent of territory than had ever been enjoyed by any of his pre|dece&s;&s;ors; the kings of Wales did him homage for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Northumbrians re|ceived a king of his appointing, and no enemy appeared to give him the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions, or excite an alarm. In this &s;tate of pro&s;perity and
<PB N="79" REF="89">
profound tranquillity, which la&s;ted for twelve years, Alfred was diligently employed in cul|tivating the arts of peace, and in repairing the damages which the kingdom had &s;u&s;tained by war. After rebuilding the ruined cities, which had been de&s;troyed by the Danes, he e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a regular militia for the defence of the king|dom. He took care that all his &s;ubjects &s;hould be armed and regi&s;tered; he a&s;&s;igned them a regular rotation of duty; a part was employed to cultivate the land, while others were ap|pointed to repel any &s;udden inva&s;ion from the enemy. He took care to provide a naval force that was more than a match for the invaders, and trained his &s;ubjects as well in the practice of &s;ailing as of naval engagements. A fleet of an hundred and twenty &s;hips of war was thus &s;ta|tioned along the coa&s;ts; and being well &s;upplied with all things nece&s;&s;ary, both for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and war, it impre&s;&s;ed the incur&s;ive enemy with awe. Not but that there &s;ucceeded &s;ome very formi|dable de&s;cents, which the king found it difficult to repre&s;s. Ha&s;tings, the Dani&s;h chieftain, in particular, appeared off the coa&s;t of Kent with a fleet of three hundred and fifty &s;ail; and al|though his forces were vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed and repul&s;ed by the vigilance of Alfred, yet he found means to &s;ecure him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="80" REF="90">
of Bamflete, near the I&s;le of Canvey, in the county of E&s;&s;ex. But he was not long &s;ettled there, when his garri&s;on was overpowered by a body of the citizens of London, with great &s;laughter, and his wife and two &s;ons made cap|tives. The&s;e experienced the king's clemen|cy: he re&s;tored them to Ha&s;tings, on condi|tion that he &s;hould depart the kingdom. Nor were the Ea&s;t-Anglian Danes, as well as in&s;ur|gents of Northumberland, much more &s;uc|ce&s;sful. The&s;e broke into rebellion; and, yielding to their favourite habits of depreda|tion, embarked on board two hundred and for|ty ve&s;&s;els, and appeared before Exeter. There, however, they met a very bloody reception from Alfred, and were &s;o di&s;couraged, that they put to &s;ea again without attempting any other enterprize. A third body of piratical Danes were even more un&s;ucce&s;sful than either of the former. Great numbers of them, after the departure of Ha&s;tings, &s;eized and fortified Sho|bury, at the mouth of the Thames, and having left a garri&s;on there, marched along the banks of the river till they came to Bodington, in the county of Glouce&s;ter, where being reinforced by a body of Wel&s;hmen, they threw up entrench|ments, and prepared for defence. There they were &s;urrounded by the king's forces, and reduc|ed
<PB N="81" REF="91">
to the utmo&s;t extremity. After having eaten their hor&s;es, and having many of them peri&s;hed with hunger, they made a de&s;perate &s;ally, in which numbers were cut to pieces. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped, being pur&s;ued by the vigi|lance of Alfred, were finally di&s;per&s;ed, or to|tally de&s;troyed. Nor did he treat the Nor|thumbrian freebooters with le&s;s &s;everity. Fal|ling upon them while they were exerci&s;ing their ravages in the we&s;t, he took twenty of their &s;hips; and having tried all the pri&s;oners at Winche&s;ter, he hanged them as pirates, and as the common enemies of mankind.</P>
<P>Having, by this vigilance and well-timed &s;e|verity, given peace and total &s;ecurity to his &s;ubjects, his next care was to poli&s;h the coun|try by arts, as he had protected it by arms. He is &s;aid to have drawn up a body of laws; but tho&s;e which remain to this day under his name &s;eem to be only the laws already practi&s;ed in the country by his Saxon ance&s;tors, and to which, probably, he gave his &s;anction. The trial by juries, mulcts and fines for offences, by &s;ome a&s;cribed to him, are of a much more an|cient date. The care of Alfred for the encou|ragement of learning did not a little tend to improve the morals and re&s;train the barbarous habits of the people. When he came to the
<PB N="82" REF="92">
throne, he found the Engli&s;h &s;unk into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance and barbari&s;m, proceeding from the continued di&s;orders of the govern|ment, and from the ravages of the Danes. He him&s;elf complains, that, on his acce&s;&s;ion, he knew not one per&s;on &s;outh of the Thames who could &s;o much as interpret the Latin &s;ervice. To remedy this deficiency, he invited over the mo&s;t celebrated &s;cholars from all parts of Eu|rope; he founded, or at lea&s;t re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and endowed it with ma|ny privileges. He gave, in his own example, the &s;tronge&s;t incentives to &s;tudy. He u&s;ually divided his time into three equal portions; one was given to &s;leep, and the refection of his body, diet, and exerci&s;e; another to the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s; and the third to &s;tudy and devotion. He made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the different &s;tudies of grammar, rhetoric, philo&s;o|phy, architecture, and geometry He was an ex|cellent hi&s;torian, he under&s;tood mu&s;ic, and was acknowledged to be the be&s;t Saxon poet of the age. He left many works behind him, many of which remain to this day. He tran&s;lated the partoral of Gregory I. <HI>Boetius de Con&s;ola|tione,</HI> and Bede's Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory, into the Saxon language. Sen&s;ible that his illite|rate &s;ubjects were not much &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;pe|culative
<PB N="83" REF="93">
in&s;truction, he endeavoured to convey his morality by parables and &s;tories, and is &s;aid to have tran&s;lated from the Greek the fables of Ae&s;op. Nor did he even neglect the more me|chanical arts of life. Before his time, the ge|nerality of the people chiefly made u&s;e of timber in building. Alfred rai&s;ed his palaces of brick, and the nobility by degrees began to imitate his example. He introduced and encouraged manufactures of all kinds, and no inventor or improver of any ingenious art was &s;uffered to go unrewarded. Even the elegancies of life were brought to him from the Mediterranean; and his &s;ubjects, by &s;eeing the&s;e productions of the peaceful arts, were taught to re&s;pect the virtues of ju&s;tice and indu&s;try, by which alone they could be procured. It was after a glorious reign of twenty-nine years thus &s;pent, in the ad|vancement of his &s;ubjects happine&s;s,<MILESTONE N="901" UNIT="A.D."> that he died in the vigour of his age and the full enjoyment of his faculties, an example to princes, and an ornament to human nature. To give a cha|racter of this prince would only be, to &s;um up tho&s;e qualities which con&s;titute perfection. Even virtues &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite, were happily blended in his di&s;po&s;ition; per&s;evering, yet flexible; moderate, yet enterpri&s;ing; ju&s;t, yet merciful; &s;tern in command, yet gentle in
<PB N="84" REF="94">
conver&s;ation. Nature al&s;o, as if de&s;irous that &s;uch admirable qualities of mind &s;hould be &s;et off to the greate&s;t advantage, had be&s;towed on him all bodily accompli&s;hments, vigour, dignity, and an engaging, open countenance. In &s;hort, hi&s;|torians have taken &s;uch delight in de&s;cribing the hero, that they have totally omitted the mention of his &s;maller errors, which doubtle&s;s he mu&s;t have had in con&s;equence of his huma|nity.</P>
<P>Alfred had, by his wife Ethel&s;witha, the daughter of a Mercian earl, three &s;ons and three daughters. His elde&s;t &s;on, Edmund, died without i&s;&s;ue, during his father's lifetime. His third &s;on, Ethelward, inherited his fa|ther's pa&s;&s;ion for letters, and lived a private life. His &s;econd &s;on, Edward, &s;ucceeded him on the throne.</P>
<P>EDWARD was &s;carce &s;ettled on the throne, when his preten&s;ions were di&s;puted by Ethel|wald, his cou&s;in-german, who rai&s;ed a large party among the Northumbrians to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e. At fir&s;t his aims &s;eemed to be favoured by fortune; but he was &s;oon after killed in battle, and his death thus freed Edward from a very dangerous competitor. Neverthele&s;s, the death of their leader was not &s;ufficient to intimidate his turbulent adherents. During the whole of
<PB N="85" REF="95">
this prince's reign, there were but few inter|vals free from the attempts and in&s;urrections of the Northumbrian rebels. Many were the battles he fought, and the victories he won; &s;o that, though he might be deemed unequal to his father in the arts of peace, he did not fall &s;hort of him in the military virtues. He built &s;everal ca&s;tles, and fortified different cities. He reduced Turkethill, a Dani&s;h invader, and obliged him to retire with his followers. He &s;ubdued the Ea&s;t Angles, and acquired dominion over the Northum|brians them&s;elves. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e conque&s;ts by his &s;i&s;ter, Ethelfleda, the widow of Ethelbert, earl of Mercia, who, after her hu&s;band's death, retained the government of that province. Thus, after Edward had re|duced the whole kingdom to his obedience, and began his endeavours to promote the happine&s;s of his people, he was prevented by death from the completion of his de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>To him &s;ucceeded ATHELSTAN,<MILESTONE N="925" UNIT="A.D."> his natural &s;on, the illegitimacy of his birth not being then deemed a &s;ufficient ob&s;tacle to his inhe|riting the crown. To this prince, as to the former, there was &s;ome oppo&s;ition made in the beginning. Alfred, a nobleman of his kin|dred,
<PB N="86" REF="96">
is &s;aid to have entered into a con&s;piracy again&s;t him, in favour of the legitimate &s;ons of the decea&s;ed king, who were yet too young to be capable of governing them&s;elves. What|ever his attempts might have been, he denied the charge, and offered to clear him&s;elf of it by oath before the pope. The propo&s;al was ac|cepted; and it is a&s;&s;erted, that he had &s;carce &s;worn him&s;elf innocent, when he fell into con|vul&s;ions, and died three days after. This mo|narch received al&s;o &s;ome di&s;turbance from the Northumbrian Danes, whom he compelled to &s;urrender; and re&s;enting the conduct of Con|&s;tantine, the king of Scotland, who had given them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he ravaged that country with impunity, till at length he was appea&s;ed by the humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of that monarch. The&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, however, being extorted, were in|&s;incere. Soon after Athel&s;tan had evacuated that kingdom, Con&s;tantine entered into a con|federacy with a body of Dani&s;h pirates, and &s;ome Welch princes who were jealous of Athel|&s;tan's growing greatne&s;s. A bloody battle was fought near Brun&s;burg, in Northumberland, in which the Engli&s;h monarch was again victo|rious. After this &s;ucce&s;s, Athel&s;tan enjoyed his crown in tranquillity, and he is regarded as one of the able&s;t and mo&s;t active of the Saxon
<PB N="87" REF="97">
kings. During his reign the Bible was tran&s;|lated into the Saxon language; and &s;ome al|liances al&s;o were formed by him with the princes on the continent.<MILESTONE N="941" UNIT="A.D."> He died at Glouce&s;|ter, after a reign of &s;ixteen years, and was &s;uc|ceeded by his brother, Edmund.</P>
<P>EDMUND, like the re&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors, met with di&s;turbance from the Northum|brians on his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; but his activity &s;oon defeated their attempts. The great end therefore which he aimed at, during his reign, was to curb the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of this people, who offered to embrace Chri&s;tianity as an atonement for their offences. Among other &s;chemes for the benefit of the people, he was the fir&s;t monarch who by law in&s;tituted capital pu|ni&s;hments in England. Remarking that fines and pecuniary mulcts were too gentle methods of treating robbers, who were in general men who had nothing to lo&s;e, he enacted, that, in gangs of robbers, when taken, the olde&s;t of them &s;hould be condemned to the gallows. This was reckoned a very &s;evere law at the time it was enacted; for, among our early ance&s;tors, all the penal laws were mild and merciful. The re&s;entment this monarch bore to men of this de&s;perate way of living was the cau&s;e of his death. His virtues, abilities, wealth, and temperance, promi&s;ed
<PB N="88" REF="98">
him a long and happy reign; when, on a cer|tain day, as he was &s;olemnizing a fe&s;tival in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, he remarked that Leolf, a no|torious robber, whom he had &s;entenced to ba|ni&s;hment, had yet the boldne&s;s to enter the hall where he was dining, and to &s;it at the table among the loyal attendants. Enraged at this in&s;olence, he commanded him to leave the room; but on his refu&s;ing to obey, the king, who&s;e temper was naturally choleric, flew a|gain&s;t him, and caught him by the hair. The ruffian, giving way to rage al&s;o on his &s;ide, drew a dagger, and lifting his arm, with a fu|rious blow &s;tabbed the monarch to the heart, who fell down on the bo&s;om of his murderer. The death of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who was in&s;tantly cut in pieces, was but a &s;mall compen&s;ation for the lo&s;s of a king, loved by his &s;ubjects, and de|&s;erving their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>The late king's &s;ons were too young to &s;uc|ceed him in the direction of &s;o difficult a go|vernment as that of England; his brother EDRED was therefore appointed to &s;ucceed, and, like his predece&s;&s;ors, this monarch found him|&s;elf at the head of a rebellious and refractory people. The Northumbrian Danes, as u&s;ual, made &s;everal attempts to &s;hake off the Engli&s;h yoke; &s;o that the king was at la&s;t obliged to
<PB N="89" REF="99">
place garri&s;ons in their mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns, and to appoint an Engli&s;h governor over them, who might &s;uppre&s;s their in&s;urrections on the fir&s;t appearance. About this time, the monks, from being contented to govern in ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical matters, began to a&s;&s;ume the direc|tion in civil affairs; and, by artfully managing the &s;uper&s;titions, and the fears of the people, erected an authority that was not &s;haken off for &s;everal &s;ucceeding centuries. Edred had blindly delivered over his con&s;cience to the guidance of Dun&s;tan, abbot of Gla&s;tonbury, who was afterwards canonized; and this man, under the appearance of &s;anctity, concealed the mo&s;t boundle&s;s ambition. The monks had hitherto been a kind of &s;ecular prie&s;ts, who, though they lived in communities, were neither &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the world, nor u&s;e|le&s;s to it. They were often married; they were a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in the education of youth, and &s;ubject to the commands of tem|poral &s;uperiors. The celibacy, and the inde|pendency of the clergy, as being a mea&s;ure that would contribute to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the papal power in Europe, was warmly recom|mended by the &s;ee of Rome to all eccle&s;ia&s;tics in general, but to the monks in particular. The pre&s;ent favourable opportunity offered of
<PB N="90" REF="100">
carrying this mea&s;ure in England, ari&s;ing from the &s;uper&s;titious character of Edred, and the furious zeal of Dun&s;tan. Both lent it all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power; and the order of Be|nedictine monks was e&s;tabli&s;hed under the di|rection of Dun&s;tan. Edred implicitly &s;ubmit|ted to his directions both in church and &s;tate; and the kingdom was in a fair way of being turned into a papal province by this zealous eccle&s;ia&s;tic, when he was checked in the mid&s;t of his career, by the death of the king, who died of a quin&s;ey, in the tenth year of his reign.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="954" UNIT="A.D."> Edwy, his nephew, who a&s;cended the throne, his own &s;ons being yet unfit to govern, was a prince of great per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, and a martial di&s;po&s;ition. But he was now come to the government of a kingdom, in which he had an enemy to contend with, again&s;t whom, all mi|litary virtues could be of little &s;ervice. Dun|&s;tan, who had governed during the former reign, was re&s;olved to remit nothing of his au|thority in this; and Edwy, immediately upon his acce&s;&s;ion, found him&s;elf involved in a quar|rel with the monks; who&s;e rage, neither his ac|compli&s;hments nor his virtues could mitigate. He &s;eems to have been elected by the &s;ecular prie&s;ts in oppo&s;ition to the monks; &s;o that their whole
<PB N="91" REF="101">
body, and Dun&s;tan at their head, pur&s;ued him with implacable animo&s;ity while living, and even endeavoured to brand his character to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>This Dun&s;tan, who makes a greater figure in the&s;e times, then even kings them&s;elves, was born of noble parents, in the we&s;t; but being defamed as a man of licentious manners in his youth, he betook him&s;elf to the au&s;te|rities of a mona&s;tic life, either to atone for his faults, or vindicate his reputation. He &s;eclud|ed him&s;elf entirely from the world, in a cell &s;o &s;mall, that he could neither &s;tand erect, nor lie along in it. It was in this retreat of con&s;tant mortification, that his zeal grew furious, and his fancy teemed with vi&s;ions of the mo&s;t extra|vagant nature. His &s;uppo&s;ed illuminations were frequent; his temptations &s;trong, but he alway re&s;i&s;ted with bravery. The devil, it was &s;aid, one day paid him a vi&s;it in the &s;hape of a fine young woman; but Dun&s;tan, knowing the deceit, and provoked at his importunity, &s;eiz|ed him by the no&s;e with a pair of red hot pincers, as he put his head into the cell, and he held him there, till the malignant &s;pirit made the whole neighbourhood re&s;ound with his bellowings. No|thing was &s;o ab&s;urd, but what the monks were ready to propagate in favour of their
<PB N="92" REF="102">
&s;ect. Crucifixes, altars, and even hor&s;es, were heard to harrangue in their defence again&s;t the &s;ecular clergy. The&s;e miracles, backed by their &s;tronger a&s;&s;ertions, prevailed with the people. Dun&s;tan was con&s;idered as the peculiar favourite of the Almighty, and appeared at court with an authority greater than that of kings; &s;ince their's was conferred by man, but his allowed by heaven it&s;elf. Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much power, it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that Edwy could make but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance; and, that his fir&s;t fault was likely to be attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. The monk found or made one on the very day of his coronation. There was a lady of the royal blood, named Elgiva, who&s;e beauty had made a &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion on this young monarch's heart. He had even ventured to marry her, contrary to the ad|vice of his coun&s;ellors, as &s;he was within the degrees of affinity prohibited by the canon law. On the day of his coronation, while his nobi|lity were giving a loo&s;e to the more noi&s;y plea|&s;ures of wine and fe&s;tivity in the great hall, Edwy retired to his wife's apartment; where, in company with her mother, he enjoyed the more plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction of her conver&s;ation. Dun&s;tan no &s;ooner perceived his ab&s;ence, than conjecturing the rea&s;on, he ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly
<PB N="93" REF="103">
into the apartment, and upbraiding him with all the bitterne&s;s of eccle&s;ia&s;tical rancour, drag|ged him forth in the mo&s;t outrageous manner. Dun&s;tan, it &s;eems, was not without his enemies, for the king was advi&s;ed to puni&s;h this in&s;ult, by bringing in him to account for the money with which he had been entru&s;ted during the la&s;t reign. This account, the haughty monk refu&s;ed to give in; wherefore, he was deprived of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil emoluments of which he had been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and bani&s;hed the kingdom. His exile only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the reputation of his &s;anctity among the people; and Odo, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was &s;o far tran&s;ported with the &s;pirit of the party, that he pronounced a divorce between Edwy and El|giva. Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures were then attend|ed with the mo&s;t formidable effects. The king could no longer re&s;i&s;t the indignation of the church, but con&s;ented to &s;urrender his beautiful wife to its fury. Accordingly, Odo &s;ent into the palace a party of &s;oldiers, who &s;eized the queen; and, by his orders, branded her on the face with an hot iron. Not content|ed with this cruel vengeance, they carried her by force into Ireland, and there command|ed her to remain in perpetual exile. This in|junction, however, was too di&s;tre&s;&s;ing for that
<PB N="94" REF="104">
faithful woman to comply with; for, being cured of her wound, and having obliterated the marks which had been made to deface her beauty, &s;he once more ventured to return to the king, whom &s;he &s;till regarded as her hu&s;|band. But misfortune &s;till continued to pur|&s;ue her. She was taken pri&s;oner by a party whom the archbi&s;hop had appointed to ob|&s;erve her conduct, and was put to death in the mo&s;t cruel manner; the &s;inews of her legs cut, and her body mangled, &s;he was thus left to expire in the mo&s;t cruel agony. In the mean time, a &s;ecret revolt again&s;t Edwy became almo&s;t ge|neral; and that it might not be doubted at who&s;e in&s;tigation this revolt was undertaken, Dun&s;tan returned to England, and put him&s;elf at the head of the party. The malecontents at la&s;t proceeded to open rebellion; and, having placed Edgar, the king's younger brother, a boy of about thirteen years of age, at their head, they &s;oon put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the northern parts of the king|dom. Edwy's power, and the number of his adherents every day declining, he was at la&s;t obliged to con&s;ent to a partition of the king|dom; but his death, which happened &s;oon af|ter, freed his enemies from all further in|quietude, and gave Edgar peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the government.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="105">Edgar being placed on the throne by the influence of the monks,<MILESTONE N="959" UNIT="A.D."> affected to be entire|ly guided by their directions in all his &s;ucceed|ing tran&s;actions. There has ever been &s;ome popular cry, &s;ome darling prejudice among&s;t the Engli&s;h; and he, who has taken the ad|vantage of it, has always found it of excellent a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his government. The &s;anctity of the monks was the cry at that time; and Ed|gar, chiming in with the people, at once pro|moted their happine&s;s, and his own glory. Few Engli&s;h monarchs have reigned with more fortune, or more &s;plendor than he. He not on|ly quieted all dome&s;tic in&s;urrections, but re|pre&s;&s;ed all foreign inva&s;ions; and his power was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;o widely extended, that he is &s;aid to have been rowed in his barge by eight tributary kings upon the river Dee. The monks, whom he promoted, are loud in his prai&s;e; and yet, the example of his con|tinence was no way corre&s;ponding with that cha&s;tity and forbearance on which they chiefly founded their &s;uperior preten&s;ions to &s;anctity. It is indeed &s;omewhat extraordinary, that one &s;hould have been extolled for his virtues by the monks, who&s;e irregularities were &s;o peculiarly oppo&s;ite to the tenets they enforced. His fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of this kind was, the breaking in|to
<PB N="96" REF="106">
a convent, carrying off Editha, a nun, by force, and even committing violence on her per&s;on. For this act of &s;acrilege and barbarity, no other penance was enjoined, than that he &s;hould ab&s;tain from wearing his crown for &s;even years. As for the lady her&s;elf, he was permitted to continue his intercour&s;e with her without &s;candal. There was another mi&s;tre&s;s of Edgar's, named Elfleda the Fair, with whom he formed a connec|tion, by a kind of accident. For being at the hou&s;e of one of his nobles, and fixing his affec|tions on the nobleman's daughter, he privately reque&s;ted that the young lady &s;hould pa&s;s that very night with him. The lady's mother knowing his power, and the impetuo&s;ity of his temper, prevailed upon her daughter &s;eem|ingly to comply with his reque&s;t; but, in the mean time, &s;ub&s;tituted a beautiful dome&s;tic in the young lady's place. In the morning, when the king perceived the deceit, in&s;tead of being di&s;plea&s;ed at the &s;tratagem, he expre&s;&s;ed plea&s;ure in the adventure; and transferring his love to Elfleda, as the dam&s;el was called, &s;he became his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, and main|tained an a&s;cendency over him till his marriage with Elfrida. The &s;tory of this lady is too remarkable to be pa&s;t over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Edgar had long heard of the beauty of a young lady, who&s;e name was Elfrida, daughter
<PB N="97" REF="107">
to the earl of Devon&s;hire; but, unwilling to credit common fame in this particular, he &s;ent Ethelwald, his favourite friend, to &s;ee, and in|form him, if Elfrida was indeed that incom|parable woman report had de&s;cribed her. Ethelwald arriving at the earl's, had no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes upon that nobleman's daughter, than he became de&s;perately enamoured of her him&s;elf. Such was the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, that, forgeting his ma&s;ter's intentions, he &s;oli|cited only his own intere&s;ts, and demanded for him&s;elf the beautiful Elfrida from her father in marriage. The favourite of a king was not likely to find a refufal; the earl gave his con|&s;ent, and their nuptials were performed in pri|vate. Upon his return to court, which was &s;hortly after, he a&s;&s;ured the king, that her riches alone, and her high quality, had been the cau&s;e of her admiration, and he appeared amazed how the world could talk &s;o much, and &s;o un|ju&s;tly of her charms. The king was &s;atisfied, and no longer felt any curio&s;ity, while Ethel|wald &s;ecretly triumphed in his addre&s;s. When he had, by this deceit, weaned the king from his purpo&s;e, he took an opportunity, after &s;ome time, of turning the conver&s;ation on Elfrida, repre&s;enting, that though the fortune of the earl of Devon&s;hire's daughter would be a trifle
<PB N="98" REF="108">
to a king, yet it would be an immen&s;e acqui&s;ition to a needy &s;ubject. He, therefore, humbly en|treated permi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;&s;es to her, as &s;he was the riche&s;t heire&s;s in the kingdom. A reque&s;t &s;o &s;eemingly rea&s;onable, was readily complied with; Ethelwald returned to his wife, and their nuptials were &s;olemnized in public. His greate&s;t care, however, was em|ployed in keeping her from court; and he took every precaution, to prevent her appear|ing before a king &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of love, while &s;he was &s;o capable of in&s;piring that pa&s;&s;ion. But it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep his treachery long concealed. Favourites are never without pri|vate enemies, who watch every opportunity of ri&s;ing upon their ruin. Edgar was &s;oon in|formed of the whole tran&s;action; but di&s;&s;em|bling his re&s;entment, he took occa&s;ion to vi&s;it that part of the country, where this miracle of beauty was detained, accompanied by Ethel|wald, who reluctantly attended him thither. Upon coming near the lady's habitation, he told him, that he had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee his wife, of whom he had formerly heard &s;o much, and de&s;ired to be introduced as his acquaintance. Ethelwald, thunder-&s;truck at the propo&s;al, did all in his power, but in vain, to di&s;&s;uade him. All he could obtain, was permi&s;&s;ion to go be|fore,
<PB N="99" REF="109">
on pretence of preparing for the king's re|ception. On his arrival, he fell at his wife's feet, confe&s;&s;ing what he had done to be po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of her charms, and conjuring her to con|ceal, as much as po&s;&s;ible, her beauty from the king, who was but too &s;u&s;ceptible of its power. Elfrida, little obliged to him for a pa&s;&s;ion that had deprived her of a crown, promi&s;ed com|pliance; but, prompted either by vanity, or revenge, adorned her per&s;on with the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite art, and called up all her beauty on the occa&s;ion. The event an&s;wered her expecta|tions; the king, no &s;ooner &s;aw, than he loved her, and was in&s;tantly re&s;olved to obtain her. The better to effect his intentions, he conceal|ed his pa&s;&s;ion from the hu&s;band, and took leave with a &s;eeming indifference; but his revenge was not the le&s;s certain and fatal. Ethelwald was &s;ome time after &s;ent into Northumberland, upon pretence of urgent affairs, and was found murdered in a wood by the way. Some &s;ay, he was &s;tabbed by the king's own hand; &s;ome, that he only commanded the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion; however this be, Elfrida was invited &s;oon after to court, by the king's own order, and their nuptials were performed with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="110">Such was the criminal pa&s;&s;ions of a mo|narch, whom the monks have thought proper to repre&s;ent as the mo&s;t perfect of mankind.

The king, finding him&s;elf wounded, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e; but, fainting with the lo&s;s of blood, he fell from the &s;addle, and his foot &s;ticking in the &s;tirrup, he was dragged along by his hor&s;e, till he was kiled.

<P>Ethelred the Second,<MILESTONE N="978" UNIT="A.D."> the &s;on of Edgar and El|frida, &s;ucceeded; a weak and irre&s;olute monarch, incapable of governing the kingdom, or pro|viding for its &s;afety. After a train of di&s;&s;en|tions, follies, and vices, which &s;eem to have marked &s;ome of the former reigns, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, that the country was weakened; and the people, taught to rely entirely on preterna|tural a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were rendered incapable of de|fending them&s;elves. During this period, there|fore, their old, and terrible enemies, the Danes, who &s;eem not to be loaded with the &s;ame accu|mulation of vice and folly, were daily gaining ground. The weakne&s;s and the inexperience of Ethelred appeared to give a favourable opportu|nity for renewing their depredations; and, ac|cordingly, they landed on &s;everal parts of the
<PB N="102" REF="112">
coa&s;t, &s;preading their u&s;ual terror and deva&s;ta|tion. The Engli&s;h, ill provided to oppo&s;e &s;uch an enemy, made but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance, en|deavouring, by treachery, or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to a|vert the &s;torm they had not &s;pirit to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>The northern invaders, now well acquainted with the defencele&s;s condition of England, made a powerful de&s;cent, under the command of Sweyn king of Denmark, and Olave king of Norway, who, &s;ailing up the Humber, commit|ted on all &s;ides their de&s;tructive ravages. The Engli&s;h oppo&s;ed them with a formidable army, but were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter. The Danes, encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, marched boldly into the heart of the kingdom, filling all places with the marks of horrid cruelty. Ethelred had, upon a former inva&s;ion of the&s;e pyrates, bought them off with money, and he now re&s;olved to put the &s;ame expedient in practice once more. He &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors, therefore, to the two kings, and offered them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and tribute, provided they would re|&s;train their ravages and depart the kingdom. It has often been remarked, that buying off an inva&s;ion only &s;erves to &s;trengthen the ene|my, and to invite a repetition of ho&s;tili|ties; &s;uch it happened upon this occa&s;ion: Sweyn and Olave agreed to the terms, and
<PB N="103" REF="113">
peaceably took up their quarters at South|ampton, where the &s;um of &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds was paid them. Olave returned to his native country, and never infe&s;ted Eng|land more; but Sweyn was le&s;s &s;crupulous, and the compo&s;ition with him gave but a &s;hort interval to the mi&s;eries of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h now found their &s;ituation truly deplorable. The weakne&s;s of the king,<MILESTONE N="998" UNIT="A.D."> the divi&s;ions of the nobility, the treachery of &s;ome, and the cowardice of others, fru&s;trated all their endeavours for mutual defence. The Danes, ever informed of their &s;ituation, and ready to take advantage of it, appeared a &s;hort time after the late infamous compo&s;ition, upon the Engli&s;h &s;hore, and ri&s;ing in their de|mands, in proportion to the people's incapacity to oppo&s;e, now demanded twenty-five thou&s;and pounds more. This &s;um they al&s;o received; and this only &s;erved to improve their de&s;ire for fre&s;h exactions. But they &s;oon had a material cau&s;e of re&s;entment given them, by which the in|fraction of the &s;tipulated treaty became nece&s;|&s;ary. The Danes, as hath been already ob&s;erv|ed, had made &s;everal &s;ettlements, for many years before, in different parts of the king|dom. There, without mixing with the natives, they &s;till maintained a peaceable corre&s;pon|dence
<PB N="104" REF="114">
and connexion among them. Their mili|tary &s;uperiority was generally acknowledged by all; and the kings of England, &s;en&s;ible of that, had been accu&s;tomed to keep in pay bodies of Dani&s;h troops, whom they quartered in different parts of the country. The&s;e mercenaries had attained to &s;uch an height of luxury, accord|ing to the old Engli&s;h writers, that they comb|ed their hair once a day, bathed them&s;elves once a week; and, by the&s;e arts, then e&s;teemed effeminate, had rendered them&s;elves &s;o agree|able to the fair &s;ex, that they debauched the wives and daughters of the Engli&s;h, and had di&s;honoured many families. To tho&s;e in&s;ults were added the treachery of their conduct upon eve|ry threatened inva&s;ion, as they &s;till &s;hewed their attachment to their own countrymen, again&s;t tho&s;e among whom they were permitted to re|&s;ide. The&s;e were motives &s;ufficient, in that barbarous age, for a general ma&s;&s;acre; and Ethelred, by a policy incident to weak princes, embraced the cruel re&s;olution of putting them all to the &s;word. This plot was carried on with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that it was executed in one day, and all the Danes in England were de|&s;troyed without mercy. But this ma&s;&s;acre, &s;o perfidious in the contriving, and &s;o cruel in the execution, in&s;tead of ending the long mi|&s;eries
<PB N="105" REF="115">
of the people only prepared the way for greater calamities.</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;h were yet congratulating each other upon their late deliverance from an inveterate enemy, Sweyn, king of Denmark, who had been informed of their treacherous cruelties, appeared off the we&s;tern coa&s;ts with a large fleet, meditating &s;laughter; and furious with revenge. The Engli&s;h vainly attempted to &s;ummon their forces together, treachery and cowardice &s;till operated, to di&s;pirit their troops or to di&s;&s;ipate them. To the&s;e mi&s;eries were added a dreadful famine, partly from the bad &s;ea&s;ons, and partly from the decay of agriculture. For a while they &s;uppo&s;ed that the Dani&s;h deva&s;ta|tions would be retarded by the payment of thir|ty thou&s;and pounds, which the invaders agreed to accept; but this, as in all the former ca&s;es, afforded but a temporary relief. For a while they placed &s;ome hopes in a powerful navy, which they found means to equip; but this was &s;oon divided and di&s;per&s;ed, without doing them any &s;ervice. Nothing therefore now remained, but their &s;uffering the ju&s;t indignation of the conqueror, and undergoing all the evils that war, inflamed by revenge, could inflict. Dur|ing this period, a general con&s;ternation, toge|ther with a mutual diffidence and di&s;&s;ention, pre|vailed.
<PB N="106" REF="116">
Ce&s;&s;ations from the&s;e calamities were purcha&s;ed, one after another, by immen&s;e &s;ums; but as they afforded a &s;hort alleviation of the common di&s;tre&s;s, at la&s;t no other re&s;ource re|mained, than that of &s;ubmitting to the Dani&s;h monarch, of &s;wearing allegiance to him, and giv|ing ho&s;tages as pledges of &s;incerity. Ethelred was obliged to fly into Normandy, and the whole country thus came under the power of Sweyn, his victorious rival.</P>
<P>The death of Sweyn, which happened about &s;ix weeks after, &s;eemed to offer a favour|able opportunity of once more re&s;toring Ethel|red to the throne, and his &s;ubjects to their liber|ties.

The conte&s;t between the&s;e two monarchs was therefore managed with great ob&s;tinacy and per&s;everance; the fir&s;t bat|tle that was fought appeared undeci&s;ive; a &s;e|cond followed, in which the Danes were victo|rious: but Edmund &s;till having intere&s;t enough to bring a third army into the field, the Dani&s;h and Engli&s;h nobility, equally harra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e convul&s;ions, obliged their kings to come to a compromi&s;e, and to divide the kingdom be|tween them by treaty. Canute re&s;erved to him&s;elf the northern parts of the kingdom, the &s;outhern parts were left to Edmund; but this prince being murdered about a month after the treaty by his two chamberlains, at Oxford, Ca|nute was left in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom.</P>
<P>Canute, though he had gratified his ambi|tion, in obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h crown, yet was obliged at fir&s;t to make &s;ome mortifying conce&s;&s;ions; and, in order to gain the affections
<PB N="108" REF="118">
of the nobility, he endeavoured to gratify their avarice. But as his power grew &s;tronger, and his title more &s;ecure, he then re&s;umed tho&s;e grants which he had made, and even put many of the Engli&s;h nobles to death, &s;en&s;ible that tho&s;e who had betrayed their native &s;overeign would never be true to him. Nor was he le&s;s &s;evere in his exactions upon the &s;ubordinate ranks of the people, levying at one time &s;even|ty-two thou&s;and pounds upon the country, and eleven thou&s;and more upon the city of Lon|don only.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;trengthened his new power, by effectually weakening all who had wealth or authority to with&s;tand him, he next be|gan to &s;hew the merciful &s;ide of his charac|ter. Nor does it &s;eem without ju&s;t grounds that he is repre&s;ented by &s;ome hi&s;torians as one of the fir&s;t characters in tho&s;e barba|rous ages. The invectives which are thrown out again&s;t him by the Engli&s;h writers &s;eem mere|ly the effect of national re&s;entment, or preju|dice, un&s;upported by truth. His fir&s;t &s;tep to reconcile the Engli&s;h to his yoke, was, by &s;end|ing back to Denmark as many of his followers as he could &s;afely &s;pare. He made no di&s;tinc|tion between the Engli&s;h and Danes in the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, but re&s;tored the Saxon

cu&s;toms in a general a&s;&s;embly of the kingdom. The two nations thus uniting with each other, were glad to breathe for a while from the tu|mult and &s;laughter in which they had mu|tually involved each other; and, to confirm their amity, the king him&s;elf married Emma, the &s;i&s;ter of Richard, duke of Normandy, who had ever warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Canute having thus &s;ettled his power in Eng|land beyond the danger of a revolution, made a voyage into Denmark, as his native domi|nions were attacked by the king of Sweden. In this expedition, Godwin, an Engli&s;h earl, was particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for his valour, and acquired that fame which afterwards laid a foundation for the immen&s;e power he acquired during the &s;ucceeding reigns. In another voy|age he made to Denmark, he attacked Nor|way; and, expelling Olaus from his kingdom, annexed it to his own empire. Thus, being at once king of England, Denmark, and Norway, he was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t warlike and potent prince in Europe; while the &s;ecurity of his power inclined his temper, which was natu|rally cruel, to mercy.</P>
<P>As his reign was begun in blood, he was, to|wards the end of it, willing to atone for his for|mer
<PB N="110" REF="120">
fiercene&s;s, by acts of penance and devotion. He built churches, endowed mona&s;teries, and appointed revenues for the celebration of ma&s;s. He even undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where he remained a con&s;iderable time; and, be&s;ides obtaining from the pope &s;ome privi|leges for the Engli&s;h &s;chool erected there, he engaged all the princes through who&s;e domi|nions he pa&s;&s;ed to de&s;i&s;t from tho&s;e heavy im|po&s;itions which they were accu&s;tomed to exact from the Engli&s;h pilgrims. The piety of the latter part of his life, and the re&s;olute valour of the former, were topics that filled the mouths of his courtiers with flattery and prai&s;e. They even affected to think his power uncontroulable, and that all things would be obedient to his command. Canute, &s;en&s;ible of their adulation, is &s;aid to have taken the following method to reprove them. He ordered his chair to be &s;et on the &s;ea-&s;hore while the tide was coming in, and commanded the &s;ea to retire. <Q REND="inline">"Thou art under my dominion, cried he; the land up|on which I &s;it is mine; I charge thee therefore, to approach no farther, nor dare to wet the feet of thy &s;overeign."</Q> He feigned to &s;it &s;ome time in expectation of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, till the waves be|gan to &s;urround him: then, turning to his courtiers, he ob&s;erved, that the titles of Lord

and Ma&s;ter belonged only to him whom both earth and &s;eas were ready to obey. Thus, feared and re&s;pected, he lived many years, ho|noured with the &s;urname of Great for his power, but de&s;erving it &s;till more for his vir|tues. He died at Shafte&s;bury, in the nineteenth year of his reign, leaving behind him three &s;ons, Sweyn, Harold, and Hardicnute. Sweyn was crowned king of Norway, Hardicnute was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Denmark, and Harold &s;uc|ceeded his father on the Engli&s;h throne.</P>
<P>HAROLD, &s;urnamed HAREFOOT,<MILESTONE N="1035" UNIT="A.D."> from his &s;wiftne&s;s in running, upon his fir&s;t coming to the crown, met with no &s;mall oppo&s;ition from his younger brother, Hardicnute. But, by the intervention of the nobles, a compromi&s;e was made between them; by which it was agreed, that Harold &s;hould have London, and all the provinces north of the Thames, while the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;outhern parts &s;hould be ceded to Hardicnute; and, until that prince &s;hould ap|pear in per&s;on, Emma, his mother, &s;hould govern in his &s;tead. But this agreement was of &s;hort duration; for queen Emma having brought over from Normandy Edward and Al|fred, de&s;cendants of the ancient Saxon kings, Alfred was invited, with the warme&s;t profe&s;|&s;ions of friend&s;hip, by Harold, to London, and

treacherou&s;ly &s;et upon, by his orders, on the way. Six hundred of his train were murdered in the mo&s;t cruel manner; he him&s;elf was ta|ken pri&s;oner, and his eyes being put out, he was conducted to the mona&s;tery of Ely, where he died &s;oon after. Edward and Emma, ap|pri&s;ed of his fate, fled to the continent, and Harold, without re&s;i&s;tance, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole kingdom. He lived to enjoy the fruits of his treachery but four years after; and dying, very little regretted by his &s;ubjects, he left the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open to his brother.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1040" UNIT="A.D."> HARDICNUTE's title was readily acknow|ledged, both by the Danes and the Engli&s;h; and, upon his arrival from the continent, he was received with the mo&s;t extravagant demon&s;tra|tions of joy. The ceremony of his coronation was &s;carce performed, when he gave the fir&s;t &s;pecimen of the badne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, in his impotent in&s;ults upon the body of his bro|ther, which he ordered to be dug up, behead|ed, and thrown into the Thames. When it was found &s;ome time after by a fi&s;herman, and bu|ried, he ordered it to be again dug up, and to be thrown into the Thames a &s;econd time. His malice, however, was in the end ineffec|tual; for it was again found, and buried with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy. Hardicnute's next act of
<PB N="113" REF="123">
rigorous &s;overeignty, was the impo&s;ition of a grievous tax, for the payment of his navy; which was the more intolerable, as the nation was threatened with a famine. In the&s;e acts of &s;everity, Godwin, duke of We&s;&s;ex, who had been a vile in&s;trument of treachery and oppre&s;|&s;ion during the former reign, was a&s;&s;i&s;tant now. However, his ba&s;e compliances did not entirely &s;creen him from the re&s;entment of Emma, who had the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to believe that he was in&s;trumental in the death of prince Alfred, her &s;on. At her in&s;tigation, therefore, Alfric, arch|bi&s;hop of York, accu&s;ed him of being an ac|complice, and demanded ju&s;tice accordingly. Godwin found means to evade the danger, by appealing to the king's avarice, and not to the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e. He pre&s;ented him with a magnificent galley, curiou&s;ly carved and gild|ed, rowed by four&s;core men, who wore each of them a gold bracelet on his arm, weighing &s;ix|teen ounces. The king, &s;oftened by this pre|&s;ent, permitted him to purge him&s;elf by oath; and Godwin very readily &s;wore, that he had no hand in the death of Alfred. This king's vio|lent and unju&s;t government was but of &s;hort duration. He died two years after his acce&s;&s;ion, in con&s;equence of exce&s;s at the marriage of a Dani&s;h lord, which was celebrated at Lambeth.
<PB N="114" REF="124">
His death, far from being regretted by the Engli&s;h, became the &s;ubject of their deri&s;ion, his anniver&s;ary being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Hock Holiday.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1041" UNIT="A.D."> EDWARD, &s;urnamed THE CONFESSOR, from his piety, had many rivals, who&s;e claims to the crown were rather more ju&s;t than his own. The direct de&s;cendants of the la&s;t Saxon mo|narch were &s;till in being, though at the remote di&s;tance of the kingdom of Hungary. Sweyn, the elde&s;t &s;on of Hardicnute, was &s;till alive, though at that time engaged in wars in Nor|way. It required therefore the utmo&s;t di|ligence in Edward to &s;ecure his claims, before either of the&s;e could come over to di&s;pute his title. His own authority, which, though great in the kingdom, was not &s;ufficient to expedite his affairs with the de&s;ired di&s;patch, he was there|fore obliged to have recour&s;e to Godwin, who&s;e power was then very exten&s;ive, to &s;econd his preten&s;ions. This nobleman, though long an enemy to his family, finding, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that their intere&s;ts were united, laid a&s;ide all former animo&s;ity, and concurred in fixing him upon the throne.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, who had long groaned under a foreign yoke, now &s;et no bounds to their joy, at finding the line of their ancient mo|narchs

re&s;tored; and at fir&s;t the warmth of their raptures was attended with &s;ome vio|lence again&s;t the Danes; but the new king, by the mildne&s;s of his character, &s;oon compo&s;ed the&s;e differences, and the di&s;tinction between the two nations gradually di&s;appeared. Thus, after a &s;truggle of above two hundred years, all things &s;eemed to remain in the &s;ame &s;tate in which tho&s;e conflicts began. The&s;e inva&s;ions from the Danes produced no new change of laws, cu&s;toms, language, or religion; nor did any other traces of their e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;eem to remain, except the ca&s;tles they built, and the families that &s;till bear their names. No far|ther mention therefore is made of two di&s;tinct nations, for the Normans coming in &s;oon after, &s;erved to unite them into a clo&s;er union.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t acts of this monarch's reign bore the appearance of &s;everity, for he re&s;umed all grants that had been made by the crown in for|mer reigns; and he ordered his mother, Em|ma, who was ever intriguing again&s;t him, to be &s;hut up in a mona&s;tery. As he had been bred in the Norman court, he &s;hewed, in every in|&s;tance, a predilection for the cu&s;toms, laws, and even the natives of that country; and, a|mong the re&s;t of his faults, though he had mar|ried Editha, the daughter of Godwin, yet,
<PB N="116" REF="126">
either from mi&s;taken piety, or fixed aver&s;ion, during his whole reign, he ab&s;tained from her bed.</P>
<P>However the&s;e actions might be regarded by many of this king's &s;ubjects, for they were all of a doubtful kind, certain it is, that Godwin, who was long grown much too powerful for a &s;ubject, made them the pretext of his oppo&s;i|tion. He began by complaining of the influ|ence of the Normans in the government, and his animo&s;ities &s;oon broke out into action. Eu&s;tace, count of Boulougne, who had married Edward's &s;i&s;ter, arrived in England upon a vi&s;it to the king, and was received with great ho|nour and affection. Upon his return to Do|ver, having &s;ent a &s;ervant before him to be|&s;peak lodgings in that city, a fray happened between this dome&s;tic and the town&s;men, in which he lo&s;t his life. The count and his at|tendants attempting to take revenge, the inha|bitants took arms, and both &s;ides engaging with great fury, the count was obliged to find &s;afety by flight, after having lo&s;t about twenty of his men, and &s;lain as many of the people. The count, exa&s;perated at this in&s;ult, returned to the court, at Glouce&s;ter, and demanded ju&s;|tice of the king, who very warmly e&s;pou&s;ed his quarrel. He in&s;tantly gave orders to Godwin,
<PB N="117" REF="127">
in who&s;e government Dover lay, to go imme|diately to the place, and to puni&s;h the inhabi|tants for their crime. This was a conjuncture highly favourable to the &s;chemes of this a&s;pir|ing chief, and thinking that now was the time to ingratiate him&s;elf with the people, he ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to obey the king's command. Sen&s;ible, however, that obedience would &s;oon be extorted, unle&s;s he could defend his in&s;o|lence, he prepared for his defence, or, rather, for an attack upon Edward. Accordingly, under a pretence of repre&s;&s;ing &s;ome di&s;orders on the Wel&s;h frontier, he &s;ecretly a&s;&s;embled a great army, and attempted to &s;urpri&s;e the king, who continued, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion, at Glouce&s;ter. Neverthele&s;s, being &s;oon in|formed of Godwin's treachery, his fir&s;t &s;tep was, privately to &s;ummon all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could, and, in the mean while, to protract the time by a pretended negociation. As &s;oon as he found him&s;elf in a capacity to take the field, he then changed his tone; and Godwin, finding him&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e his &s;uperior force, or to keep his army together, permitted it to di&s;per&s;e, and took &s;helter with Baldwin, earl of Flanders. His e&s;tates, which were nu|merous, together with tho&s;e of his &s;ons, were confi&s;cated, and the greatne&s;s of the fa|mily
<PB N="118" REF="128">
&s;eemed, for a time, totally over|thrown.</P>
<P>But this nobleman's power was too &s;trong to be &s;haken by &s;o &s;light a bla&s;t; for, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a fleet by the earl of Flanders, he landed on the I&s;le of Wight, where he was joined by his &s;on Harold, with a &s;quadron which that nobleman had collected in Ireland. From thence being reinforced by great num|bers of his former dependants and followers, he &s;ailed up the Thames, and, appearing before Lon|don, threw all things into confu&s;ion. In this exi|gence, the king alone &s;eemed re&s;olute; but his nobility, many of whom were &s;ecretly inclined to Godwin, brought on a negociation; in which it was &s;tipulated, that the king &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s all his foreign &s;ervants, the primate being among the number, and that Godwin &s;hould give ho&s;|tages for his own future good behaviour. God|win's death, which followed &s;oon after, pre|vented him from reaping the fruits of an agree|ment, by which the king's authority was almo&s;t reduced to nothing.</P>
<P>This nobleman was &s;ucceeded in his govern|ments and offices by his &s;on, Harold, who, in his ambition, was equal to his father, but in his virtues and abilities far his &s;uperior. By a mo|de&s;t and gentle demeanour he acquired the good-will of Edward, or at lea&s;t &s;oftened tho&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="129">
impre&s;&s;ions of hatred which he had long borne the whole family. He artfully in&s;inuated him|&s;elf into the affections of the people by his li|berality and apparent candour, while every day he encrea&s;ed his power, by &s;eeming mode&s;tly to decline it. By the&s;e arts he not only &s;up|planted Algar, duke of Mercia, whom the king rai&s;ed up to rival his power, but he got his brother, To&s;ti, made duke of Northumber|land, upon the death of Siward, who had long governed that province with great glory.</P>
<P>Harold's in&s;inuating manners, his power, and virtues, extended and encrea&s;ed his popu|larity to &s;uch a degree, that he began to be talked of as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to &s;ucceed to the crown. But nothing could be more un|grateful to Edward than &s;uch a de&s;ire, as he abhorred a &s;ucce&s;&s;or from the family of God|win. Arouzed, therefore, by the&s;e rumours, he &s;ent for his nephew, Edward, from Hun|gary, who was, in fact, the direct de&s;cendant from the ancient Saxon kings. Prince Edward &s;oon arrived, but was &s;carce &s;afe landed, when he died, leaving his preten&s;ions to Edgar Athe|ling, his &s;on, who was too young, weak, and inactive, to avail him&s;elf of his title. The king was now therefore thrown into new diffi|culties. He &s;aw the youth and inexperience
<PB N="120" REF="130">
of Edgar, and dreaded the immoderate ambi|tion of Harold. He could not, without re|luctance, think of encrea&s;ing the grandeur of a family which had ri&s;en on the ruins of royal authority, and had been &s;tained in the blood of his own brother. In this uncertainty, he is &s;aid to have ca&s;t his eyes on William, duke of Normandy, as a per&s;on fit to &s;ucceed him; but of the truth of this circum&s;tance, we mu&s;t, at this di&s;tance of time, be contented to remain in uncertainty.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Harold did not remit in obedience to the king, or his a&s;&s;iduities to the people; &s;till encrea&s;ing in his power, and pre|paring his way for his advancement, on the fir&s;t vacancy, to the throne. In the&s;e aims, fortune her&s;elf &s;eemed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and two incidents which happened about this time,<MILESTONE N="1057" UNIT="A.D."> contributed to fix that popularity, which he had been &s;o long eagerly in pur&s;uit of. The Wel&s;h renewing their ho&s;tilities under prince Griffin, were re|pelled by him, and rendered tributary to the crown of England. The other incident was no le&s;s honourable: his brother, To&s;ti, who had been appointed to the government of Northumberland, having grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed the people, was expelled in an in&s;urrection, and Harold was ordered by the king to rein&s;tate
<PB N="121" REF="131">
him in his power, and puni&s;h the in&s;urgents. While yet at the head of an army, preparing to take &s;ignal vengeance for the injury done to his brother, he was met by a deputation of the people who had been &s;o cruelly governed. They a&s;&s;ured him that they had no intention to rebel, but had taken up arms merely to protect them&s;elves from the cruelty of a rapa|cious governor. They enumerated the griev|ances they had &s;u&s;tained from his tyranny, brought the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of his guilt, and appealed to Harold's equity for redre&s;s. This nobleman, convinced of To&s;ti's brutality, &s;a|crificed his affection to his duty; and not only procured their pardon from the king, but con|firmed the governor whom the Northumbrians had cho&s;en in his command. From that time, Harold became the idol of the people; and, in|deed, his virtues de&s;erved their love, had they not been excited by ambition.</P>
<P>Harold, thus &s;ecure of the affections of the Engli&s;h, no longer &s;trove to conceal his aims, but openly a&s;pired at the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He eve|ry where in&s;inuated, that as the heir-apparent to the crown was utterly unequal to the ta&s;k of government, both from ape and natural im|becility, there was none &s;o proper as a man of mature experience, and tried integrity; he
<PB N="122" REF="132">
alledged, that a man born in England was only fit to govern Engli&s;hmen; and that none but an able general could defend them again&s;t &s;o many foreign enemies, as they were every day threatened with. The people readily &s;aw to what the&s;e &s;peeches tended; and, in&s;tead of di&s;countenancing his preten&s;ions, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with their wi&s;hes and applau&s;e. Edward, bro|ken with age and infirmities, his mind entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the vi&s;ions of &s;uper&s;tition, and warmly attached to none, &s;aw the danger to which the government was expo&s;ed, but took feeble and irre&s;olute &s;teps to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. While he continued thus uncertain, he was &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;ickne&s;s, which brought him to his end,<MILESTONE N="1066" UNIT="A.D."> on the fifth of January, in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age, and twenty-fifth of his reign.</P>
<P>This prince, who was reverenced by the monks, under the title of Saint and Confe&s;&s;or; had but weak preten&s;ions to either, being in|dolent, irre&s;olute, and credulous. The tran|quilty of his reign was owing rather to the weakne&s;s of his foreign enemies, than to his own dome&s;tic &s;trength. But, though he &s;eem|ed to have few active virtues, yet he cer|tainly had no vices of an atrocious kind; and the want of the pa&s;&s;ions, rather than their
<PB N="123" REF="133">
re&s;traint, was then, as it has been long &s;ince, the be&s;t title to canonization. He was the fir&s;t, who, from his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity, touched for the king's evil.</P>
<P>Harold, who&s;e intrigues and virtues &s;eem|ed to give a right to his preten&s;ions, a&s;cend|ed the throne without any oppo&s;ition. The citizens of London, who were ever fond of an elective monarchy, &s;econded his claims; the clergy adopted his cau&s;e; and the body of the people, who&s;e friend he had been, &s;incere|ly loved him. Nor were the fir&s;t acts of his reign unworthy of the general prejudice in his favour. He took the mo&s;t effectual mea|&s;ures for an impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; ordered the laws to be revi&s;ed, and reformed; and tho&s;e di&s;turbers of the public peace to be puni&s;hed, who had thriven under the lenity of the la&s;t reign.</P>
<P>But neither his valour, his ju&s;tice, nor his popularity, were able to &s;ecure him from the misfortunes attendant upon an ill-grounded title. The fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of his danger, came from his own brother, To&s;ti, who had taken refuge in Flanders, and went among the princes of the Continent, endeavouring to en|gage them in a league again&s;t Harold, whom he repre&s;ented as a tyrant and u&s;urper. Not con|tent
<PB N="124" REF="134">
with this, being furni&s;hed with &s;ome &s;hips by the earl of Flanders, he made a de&s;cent up|on the i&s;le of Wight, which he laid under con|tribution, and pillaged along the coa&s;t, until he was encountered, and routed by Morcar, who had been appointed to the government from which he was expelled.</P>
<P>But he was not yet without &s;uccour, for Harfagar, king of Norway, who had been brought over by his remon&s;trances, arrived with a fleet of two hundred &s;ail at the mouth of the river Humber, where he was joined by the &s;hattered remains of To&s;ti's forces. It was in vain that the earls of Mercia and Nor|thumberland attempted to &s;top their progre&s;s, with a body of new-rai&s;ed undi&s;ciplined troops: they were quickly routed, and York fell a prey to the enemy. Mean while, Harold be|ing informed of this misfortune, ha&s;tened with an army to the protection of his people, and expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t ardour to &s;hew him&s;elf worthy of their favour. He had given &s;o many proofs of an equitable and prudent ad|mini&s;tration, that the people flocked from all quarters to join his &s;tandard; and, as &s;oon as he reached the enemy at Standford, he found him&s;elf in a condition of giving them battle. The action was very bloody, but the victory
<PB N="125" REF="135">
was deci&s;ive on the &s;ide of Harold, and ended in the total rout of the Norwegians, Harfa|gar, their king, and To&s;ti being &s;lain. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped, owed their &s;afety to the per&s;onal prowe&s;s of a brave Norwegian; who, &s;ingly, defended a bridge over the Derwent for three hours, again&s;t the whole Engli&s;h army; dur|ing which time, he &s;lew forty of their be&s;t men with his battle-ax, but he was at length &s;lain by an arrow. Harold, pur&s;uing his victory, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a Norwegian fleet that lay in the river Ou&s;e; and had the genero&s;ity to give prince Olave, the &s;on of Harfagar, his liberty, and to allow him to depart with twen|ty ve&s;&s;els. There had never before been in England an engagement between two &s;uch numerous armies, each being compo&s;ed of no le&s;s than three&s;core thou&s;and men. The news of this victory diffu&s;ed inexpre&s;&s;ible joy over the whole kingdom; they gloried in a mo|narch, who now &s;hewed him&s;elf able to de|fend them from in&s;ult, and avenge them of their invaders; but they had not long time for triumph, when news was brought of a fre&s;h inva&s;ion, more formidable than had ever been formed again&s;t England before. This was under the conduct of William, duke of Normandy, who landed at Ha&s;t|ings,
<PB N="126" REF="136">
with an army of di&s;ciplined veterans,<MILESTONE N="Sept. 28, 1066."> and laid claim to the Engli&s;h crown.</P>
<P>William, who was afterwards called the Conqueror, was the natural &s;on of Robert, duke of Normandy. His mother's name was Arlette, a beautiful maid of Falaize, whom Robert fell in love with, as &s;he &s;tood gazing at her door whil&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed through the town. William, who was the offspring of this amour, owed a part of his greatne&s;s to his birth, but &s;till more to his own per&s;onal merit. His body was vigorous, his mind capacious and noble, and his courage not be repre&s;&s;ed by apparent danger. His father, Robert, growing old, and, as was common with princes then, &s;uper&s;ti|tious al&s;o, re&s;olved upon a pilgrimage to Je|ru&s;alem, contrary to the advice and opinion of all his nobility. As his heart was fixed upon the expedition, in&s;tead of attending to their remon&s;trances, he &s;hewed them his &s;on Wil|liam, whom, though illegitimate, he tender|ly loved, and recommended to their care, exacting an oath from them of homage and fealty. He then put him, as he was yet but ten years of age, under the tutelage of the French king; and &s;oon after, going into A&s;ia, from whence he never returned, left young William rather the inheritor of his wi&s;hes,
<PB N="127" REF="137">
than his crown. In fact, William, from the beginning, found him&s;elf expo&s;ed to many dangers, and much oppo&s;ition, from his youth and inexperience, from the reproach of his birth, from a &s;u&s;pected guardian, a di&s;puted title, and a di&s;tracted &s;tate. The regency, appointed by Robert, found great difficulties in &s;upporting the government again&s;t this complication of dangers; and the young prince, when he came of age, found him&s;elf reduced to a very low condition. But the great qualities which he &s;oon di&s;played in the field, and the cabinet, gave encouragement to his friends, and &s;truck a terror into his ene|mies. He on all &s;ides oppo&s;ed his rebel|lious &s;ubjects, and repre&s;&s;ed foreign inva|ders, while his valour and conduct prevailed in every action. The tranquility which he had thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in his dominions, induced him to extend his views; and &s;ome overtures, made him by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, in the latter part of his reign, who was wavering in the choice of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, enflamed his ambi|tion with a de&s;ire of &s;ucceeding to the Engli&s;h throne. Whether Edward really appointed him to &s;ucceed, as William all along pretend|ed, is, at this di&s;tance of time, uncertain; but it is beyond a doubt, that Harold happening
<PB N="128" REF="138">
to pay a vi&s;it to the Norman coa&s;t, was induc|ed by this prince, to acknowledge his claims, and to give a promi&s;e of &s;econding them. This promi&s;e, however, Harold did not think pro|per to perform, when it &s;tood in the way of his own ambition; and afterwards, when William objected the breach, he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by alledging, that it was extorted from him, at a time when he had no power to refu&s;e. On whatever &s;ide ju&s;tice might lie, the pretext on William's part was, that he was appointed heir to the crown of England by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, upon a vi&s;it he had paid that mo|narch during his life-time. In con&s;equence of the&s;e preten&s;ions, he was not remi&s;s, after the death of Edward, to lay in his claims; but Harold would admit none of them, re&s;olved to defend, by his valour, what his intrigues had won. William, finding that arms alone were to be the final deciders of this di&s;pute, prepar|ed to a&s;&s;ert his right with vigour. His &s;ub|jects, as they had long been di&s;tingui&s;hed for va|lour among the European nations, had, at this time, attained to the highe&s;t pitch of military glory. His court was the center of politene&s;s; and all who wi&s;hed for fame in arms, or was naturally fond of adventure, flocked to put them&s;elves under his conduct. The fame of
<PB N="129" REF="139">
his intended inva&s;ion of England, was diffu&s;ed over the whole Continent; multitudes came to offer him their &s;ervices in this expedition; &s;o that he was embarra&s;&s;ed rather in the choice of whom he &s;hould take, than in the levying his forces. The pope him&s;elf was not be|hind the re&s;t in favouring his preten&s;ions; but, either influenced by the apparent ju&s;tice of his claims, or by the hopes of extending the autho|rity of the church, he immediately pronoun|ced Harold an u&s;urper. He denounced excom|munication again&s;t him, and all his adherents; and &s;ent the duke a con&s;ecrated banner, to in|&s;pire him with confidence. With &s;uch fa|vourable incentives, William &s;oon found him|&s;elf at the head of a cho&s;en army of &s;ixty thou|&s;and men, all equipped in the mo&s;t warlike and &s;plendid manner. The di&s;cipline of the men, the vigour of the hor&s;es, the lu&s;tre of the arms and accoutrements, were objects that had been &s;carcely &s;een in Europe for &s;ome ages before. It was in the beginning of &s;ummer that he embarked this powerful body, on board a fleet of three hundred &s;ail; and, after &s;ome &s;mall oppo&s;ition from the weather, landed at Peven&s;ey, on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex, with re&s;olute tranquility. William him&s;elf, as he came on &s;hore, happened to &s;tumble and fall; but, in|&s;tead
<PB N="130" REF="140">
of being di&s;compo&s;ed at the accident, he had the pre&s;ence of mind to cry out, that he thus took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country. Different from all the ravagers to which England had been formerly accu&s;tomed, this brave prince made no &s;how of invading a foreign country, but rather encamping in his own. Here he continued in a quiet and peaceable manner for about a fortnight, either willing to refre&s;h his troops, or de&s;irous of knowing the reception his preten&s;ions to the crown &s;hould meet with among the people. After having refre&s;hed his men at this place, and &s;ent back his fleet to Normandy, to leave no retreat for cowardice, he advanced a|long the &s;ea-&s;ide to Ha&s;tings, where he publi&s;h|ed a manife&s;to, declaring the motives that in|duced him to undertake this enterprize.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon rou&s;ed from his inactivity by the approach of Harold, who &s;eemed re&s;olved to defend his right to the crown, and retain that &s;overeignty which he had received from the people, who only had a right to be&s;tow it. He was now returning, flu&s;hed with conque&s;t, from the defeat of the Norwegians, with all the forces he had employed in that expedition, and all he could invite or collect in the country through which he pa&s;&s;ed. His army was com|po&s;ed of active and valiant troops, in high &s;pi|rits,
<PB N="131" REF="141">
&s;trongly attached to their king, and eager to engage. On the other hand, the army of Wil|liam con&s;i&s;ted of the flower of all the Continent, and had been long enured to danger. The men of Bretagne, Bologne, Flanders, Poictou, Maine, Orleans, France, and Normandy, were all vo|luntarily united under his command. England never before, nor never &s;ince, &s;aw two &s;uch armies drawn up to di&s;pute its crown. The day before the battle, William &s;ent an offer to Harold to decide the quarrel between them by &s;ingle combat, and thus to &s;pare the blood of thou&s;ands; but Harold refu&s;ed, and &s;aid, he would leave it to the God of armies to de|termine. Both armies, therefore, that night, pitched in &s;ight of each other, expecting the dawning of the next day with impatience. The Engli&s;h pa&s;&s;ed the night in &s;ongs and fea&s;ting; the Normans, in devotion and prayer.</P>
<P>The next morning, at &s;even, as &s;oon as day appeared, both armies were drawn up in array again&s;t each other. Harold appeared in the center of his forces, leading on his army on foot, that his men might be more encou|raged, by &s;eeing their king expo&s;ed to an equality of danger. William fought on hor&s;e|back, leading on his army, that moved at once, &s;inging the &s;ong of Roland, one of
<PB N="132" REF="142">
the famous chiefs of their country. The Nor|mans began the fight with their cro&s;s-bows, which, at fir&s;t, galled, and &s;urpri&s;ed the Eng|li&s;h, and as their ranks were clo&s;e, their arrows did great execution. But &s;oon they came to clo&s;er fight, and the Engli&s;h, with their bills, hewed down their adver&s;aries with great &s;laugh|ter. Confu&s;ion was &s;preading among the ranks, when William, who found him&s;elf on the brink of de&s;truction, ha&s;tened, with a &s;elect band, to the relief of his forces. His pre&s;ence re&s;tored the &s;u&s;pen&s;e of battle; he was &s;een in every place, endeavouring to pierce the ranks of the enemy, and had three hor&s;es &s;lain under him. At length, perceiving that the Engli&s;h line continued impenetrable, he pre|tended to give ground, which, as he expected, drew the enemy from their ranks, and he was in&s;tantly ready to take advantage of their di&s;|order. Upon a &s;ignal given, the Normans readily returned to the charge, with greater fury than before, broke the Engli&s;h troops, and pur&s;ued them to a ri&s;ing ground. It was in this extremity, that Harold was &s;een flying from rank to rank, rallying and in&s;piring his troops with vigour; and, though he had toiled all day, till near night-fall, in the front of his Kenti&s;h men, yet he &s;till &s;eemed unabated in
<PB N="133" REF="143">
force or courage, keeping his men to the po&s;t of honour. Once more, therefore, the victory &s;eemed to turn again&s;t the Normans, and they fell in great numbers, &s;o that the fiercene&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of this memorable battle, was often renewed by the courage of the leaders, whenever that of the &s;oldiers began to &s;lacken. Fortune, at length, determined a victory, that valour was unable to decide. Harold, making a furious on&s;et at the head of his troops, again&s;t the Norman heavy armed infantry, was &s;hot into the brains by an arrow; and his two va|liant brothers, fighting by his &s;ide, &s;hared the &s;ame fate. He fell with his &s;word in his hand, amid&s;t heaps of &s;lain, and after the battle, the royal corp&s;e could hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed among the dead. From the moment of his death, all courage &s;eemed to for&s;ake the Engli&s;h; they gave ground on every &s;ide, and were pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter by the vic|torious Normans. Thus, after a battle, which was fought from morning till &s;un-&s;et, the in|vaders proved &s;ucce&s;sful, and the Engli&s;h crown became the reward of victory. There fell near fifteen thou&s;and of the Normans, while the lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the vanqui&s;hed was yet more con&s;iderable, be&s;ide that of the king, and his two brothers. The next day,
<PB N="134" REF="144">
the dead body of Harold was brought to Wil|liam, and generou&s;ly re&s;tored, without ran|&s;om, to his mother.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Oct. 14. 1066."> This was the end of the Saxon monarchy in England, which had continued for more than &s;ix hundred years. Before the times of Alfred, the kings of this race &s;eemed totally immer&s;ed in ignorance; and after him, taken up with combating the &s;uper&s;tition of the monks, or blindly obeying its dictates. As for the crown, during this period, it was neither wholly elec|tive, nor yet totally hereditary, but di&s;po&s;ed either by the will of the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or obtained by the eminent intrigues or &s;ervices of &s;ome per|&s;on nearly allied to the royal family. As for the laws and cu&s;toms of this race, they brought in many, long in practice among their German ance&s;tors; but they adopted al&s;o many more which they found among the Britons, or which the Romans left behind them after their abdi|cation. They a&s;&s;umed, in imitation of tho&s;e nations, the name of Kings; nay, &s;ome of them, took the Greek appellation of Ba&s;ileus, a title unknown to the countries from whence they came. Their noblemen al&s;o a&s;&s;umed names of Roman authority, being termed Dukes or Duces; while the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, were bought and &s;old with the farms
<PB N="135" REF="145">
they cultivated; an horrid cu&s;tom, fir&s;t intro|duced by the Greeks and Romans, and after|wards adopted by the countries they conquer|ed. Their canon laws al&s;o, which often controuled the civil authority, had primari|ly their origin in Rome; and the prie&s;ts and monks who drew them up, had generally their education there. We mu&s;t not, there|fore, a&s;cribe the laws and cu&s;toms which then prevailed over England, entirely to Saxon o|riginal, as many of them were derived from the Britons and Romans. But now the Saxon monarchy was no more; all cu&s;toms and laws, of whatever original, were ca&s;t down into one common ma&s;s, and cemented by tho&s;e of Nor|man in&s;titution. The whole face of obliga|tion was altered, and the new ma&s;ters in&s;titut|ed new modes of obedience. The laws were improved; but the ta&s;te of the people for po|lite learning, arts, and philo&s;ophy, for more than four hundred years after, were &s;till to continue the &s;ame. It appears &s;urpri&s;ing enough, that in &s;uch a variety of events, &s;uch innova|tion in military di&s;cipline, and &s;uch changes in government, that true politene&s;s, and what is called ta&s;te in the arts, never came to be culti|vated. Perhaps, the rea&s;on may be, that while the authority of the church continued &s;o great,
<PB N="136" REF="146">
the people were afraid of any knowledge but that derived to them through their clergy; and, being &s;ecluded from the ordinary conver&s;ation of mankind, they were but indifferent judges of human nature. A monk of the tenth cen|tury, and a monk of the eighteen century, are equally refined, and equally fit to advance tho&s;e &s;tudies that give us an acquaintance with our&s;elves, or that tend to di&s;play the mazes of the human heart.</P>

<P>NOTHING could exceed the con&s;terna|tion of the Engli&s;h upon the lo&s;s of the battle of Ha&s;tings; their king &s;lain, the flower of their nobility cut off, and their whole army di&s;per&s;ed or de&s;troyed, &s;truck them with de&s;pair. Very little &s;eemed now remaining, but a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the victor; and William, &s;en&s;ible of their terrors, was care|ful
<PB N="138" REF="148">
not to lo&s;e the fruits of victory by de|lay. Accordingly, after the pur&s;uit of the fly|ing enemy, and a &s;hort refre&s;hment of his own army, he &s;et forward on the completion of his de&s;ign; and &s;itting down before Dover, took it after a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance, and fortified it with fre&s;h redoubts. After a &s;hort delay at this place, he advanced by quick marches towards London, where his approach &s;erved to &s;pread new confu&s;ion. The inhabitants for &s;ome time he&s;itated between their terrors and their loyal|ty; but, ca&s;ting their eyes on every &s;ide, they &s;aw no per&s;on of valour or authority &s;ufficient to &s;upport them in their independence. Edgar Atheling, the right heir to the crown, was a weak and feeble prince, without courage or ambition; all their other leaders were either de&s;troyed, or too remote to lend them a&s;i&s;tance. The clergy, who had a large &s;hare in the deli|beration, declared openly for a prince who&s;e preten&s;ions were acknowledged, and who&s;e arms were ble&s;&s;ed by the holy &s;ee. Nothing therefore remained, but to &s;ubmit to the nece&s;|&s;ity of the times, and to acknowledge tho&s;e claims which it was not in their power to op|po&s;e. As &s;oon, therefore, as William pa&s;&s;ed the Thames, at Wallingford, Stigand, the pri|mate, made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to him in the name of
<PB N="139" REF="149">
the clergy; and, before he came within &s;ight of the city, all the chief nobility, and Edgar Atheling him&s;elf, who ju&s;t before had been created king, came into his camp, and declar|ed an intention of yielding to his authority. William was glad of being thus peaceably put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a throne, which &s;everal of his predece&s;&s;ors had not gained without repeated victories. He therefore accepted the crown upon the terms that were offered him, which were, that he &s;hould govern according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms of the country. William, though he had it in his power to dictate his own conditons, rather than receive any, cho&s;e to have his election con&s;idered rather as a gift from his &s;ubjects, than a mea&s;ure ex|torted by him. He knew him&s;elf to be a con|queror, but was willing to be thought a legal king.</P>
<P>In order to give his inva&s;ion all the &s;anction po&s;&s;ible, he was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by the archbi&s;hop of York, and took the oath u&s;ual in the times of the Saxon and Dani&s;h kings, which was, to protect and defend the church, to ob&s;erve the laws of the realm, and to govern the people with impartiality. Having thus given all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to the Eng|li&s;h, his next care was, to reward the many
<PB N="140" REF="150">
brave adventurers who had followed his for|tunes. He fir&s;t divided the lands of the Eng|li&s;h barons who oppo&s;ed him among the Nor|man barons who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted his enterprize; and &s;uch as he could neither &s;upply with mo|ney nor lands, he appointed to the vacant of|fices of the &s;tate. But, as there were &s;till num|bers unprovided for, he quartered them on the rich abbeys of the kingdom, until better means offered for their advancement. This, which gave no &s;mall umbrage to the clergy, was but little re&s;ented by the people, who were willing to &s;ee their own burthens lightened, by having a part of them laid upon &s;houlders that were at that time much better able to bear them.</P>
<P>But what gave them great umbrage, was, to &s;ee him place all real power in the hands of his own countrymen, and &s;till to give them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;word, to which he owed all his authority. He di&s;armed the city of Lon|don, and other places which appeared mo&s;t warlike and populous, and quartered Norman &s;oldiers in all tho&s;e places where he mo&s;t dread|ed an in&s;urrection. Having thus &s;ecured the government, and, by a mixture of vigour and lenity brought the Engli&s;h to an entire &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, he re&s;olved to return to the continent, there to enjoy the triumph and congratulation
<PB N="141" REF="151">
of his ancient &s;ubjects. Having, therefore, no rea&s;on to apprehend any di&s;turbance in his ab|&s;ence among the Engli&s;h, who&s;e affection he had taken &s;uch pains to conciliate, he left the regency with his brother Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux, and William Fitzo&s;borne. To &s;ecure him&s;elf yet farther, he re&s;olved to carry along with him all the Engli&s;h noblemen, from who&s;e power or inclination he could apprehend a re|volt; and, pretending to take great plea&s;ure in their conver&s;ation, he &s;et &s;ail with his honour|able captives for Normandy, where he was re|ceived by his natural &s;ubjects with a mixture of admiration and joy. He re&s;ided for &s;ome time at the abbey of Fe&s;champ, where he was vi&s;ited by an amba&s;&s;ador from the king of France, &s;ent to congratulate his &s;ucce&s;s. William, natu|rally fond of &s;plendour, received this emba&s;&s;y with great &s;tate and magnificence, while his Engli&s;h courtiers, willing to ingratiate them|&s;elves with their new &s;overeign, endeavoured to out&s;hine each other, and made a di&s;play of riches which &s;truck foreigners with a&s;to|ni&s;hment. It was probably this fooli&s;h o&s;ten|tation that excited the pride of the Normans, to treat men with contempt who were appa|rently &s;o much above them.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="152">In the mean time, the ab&s;ence of the Con|queror in England produced the mo&s;t fatal ef|fects. His officers being no longer controlled by his ju&s;tice, thought this a fit opportunity for extortion; while the Engli&s;h, no longer awed by his pre&s;ence, thought it the happie&s;t occa|&s;ion for vindicating their freedom. The two governors he had left behind took all opportu|nities of oppre&s;&s;ing the people; either de&s;iring to provoke them into rebellion, in order to pro|fit by confi&s;cations, or, in ca&s;e they &s;ub|mitted tamely to their impo&s;itions, to grow rich without &s;laughter. The inhabitants of Kent, who were more immediately expo&s;ed to the&s;e outrages, having repeated their com|plaints and remon&s;trances to no purpo&s;e, at length had recour&s;e to Eu&s;tace, count of Bou|logne, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in an attack upon the garri&s;on of Dover. But the Normans were up|on their guard, and having repul&s;ed the a&s;&s;ail|ants with &s;ome &s;laughter, took the nephew of count Eu&s;tace pri&s;oner. This mi&s;carriage did not deter Edric the Fore&s;ter from repelling the depredations of the Normans, and, in his turn, from wa&s;ting their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But though the&s;e open ho&s;tilities were not very con&s;iderable, the di&s;affection among the Engli&s;h was general, and the people began too late to perceive, that
<PB N="143" REF="153">
&s;trength will ever give laws to ju&s;tice. A &s;ecret con&s;piracy was therefore formed for de&s;troying all the Normans, as the Danes had been for|merly cut off; and this was pro&s;ecuted with &s;o much animo&s;ity, that the va&s;&s;als of the earl Coxo put him to death, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to head them again&s;t the invaders.</P>
<P>William, being informed of the&s;e commo|tions, ha&s;tened over to England, and arrived time enough to prevent the execution of this bloody enterprize. The con&s;pirators had al|ready taken the re&s;olution, and fixed the day, for their intended ma&s;&s;acre, which was to be on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, during the time of divine &s;er|vice, when all the Normans would be unarmed, as penitents, according to the di&s;cipline of the times. But his pre&s;ence quickly di&s;concerted all their &s;chemes. Such of them as had been more open in their mutiny, betrayed their guilt by flight; and this &s;erved to confirm the proofs of an accu&s;ation again&s;t tho&s;e who remained.</P>
<P>From that time forward the king began to lo&s;e all confidence in his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and to regard them as inveterate and irreconcileable enemies. He had already rai&s;ed &s;uch a number of fortre&s;&s;es in the kingdom, that he no longer dreaded the tumultuous or tran&s;ient efforts of a di&s;contented multitude; he determined to treat
<PB N="144" REF="154">
them as a conquered nation, to indulge his own avarice, and that of his followers, by numerous confi&s;cations, and to &s;ecure his power by hum|bling all who were able to make any re&s;i&s;tance. The fir&s;t &s;ignal of his arbitrary power was ma|nife&s;ted in renewing the odious tax of Dane|gelt, which had been aboli&s;hed by Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. This mea&s;ure produced remon|&s;trances, complaints, and even in&s;urrections, in different parts of the kingdom; but William, con&s;cious of his power, marched again&s;t &s;uch as were mo&s;t formidable, and &s;oon compelled them to implore for mercy. In this manner the inhabitants of Exeter and Cornwall excited his re&s;entment, and experienced his lenity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1068" UNIT="A.D."> But the&s;e in&s;urrections were &s;light, compar|ed to that in the north, which &s;eemed to threa|ten the mo&s;t important con&s;equences. This was excited by the intrigues of Edwin and Morcar, the two mo&s;t powerful noblemen of the Engli&s;h race, who, joined by Blethim, prince of North Wales, Malcolm, king of Scotland, and Sweyn, king of Denmark, re|&s;olved to make one terrible effort for the reco|very of their ancient liberties. But the vigour and celerity of William de&s;troyed their projects before they were ripe for execution; for, ad|vancing towards them at the head a powerful

army, by forced marches, the two earls were &s;o intimidated, that, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing, they had recour&s;e to the Conqueror's clemency, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He did not think proper to reject their advances, but pardoned them without farther he&s;itation. A peace which he made with Mal|colm, king of Scotland, &s;hortly after, &s;eemed to deprive them of all hopes of future a&s;&s;i&s;tance from without.</P>
<P>But whatever the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of William might have been, the inhabitants, whether Engli&s;h or Normans, were at that time in a mo&s;t dreadful &s;ituation. All the mi&s;eries that in&s;olence on one hand, and hatred on the other; that tyran|ny and trea&s;on, &s;u&s;picion and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, could bring upon a people, were there united. The Normans were &s;een to commit continual in&s;ults upon the Engli&s;h, and the&s;e vainly &s;ought redre&s;s from their partial ma&s;ters. Thus, legal puni&s;hment being denied, they &s;ought for private vengeance; and a day &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed, but the bodies of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Normans were found in the woods and highways, without any po&s;&s;ibility of bringing the perpetrators to ju&s;|tice. Thus, at length, the conquerors them|&s;elves began again to wi&s;h for the tranquillity and &s;ecurity of their native country; and &s;eve|ral of them, though entru&s;ted with great com|mands,
<PB N="146" REF="156">
de&s;ired to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervice. In order to prevent the&s;e de&s;ertions, which Wil|liam highly re&s;ented, he was obliged to allure others to &s;tay, by the largene&s;s of his boun|ties. The&s;e brought on fre&s;h exactions, and new in&s;urrections were the natural con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Northumberland, impa|tient of their yoke, attacked the Norman garri|&s;on in Durham, and taking advantage of the governor's negligence, put him, with &s;even hundred of his men, to the &s;word. The Nor|man governor of York &s;hared the &s;ame fate; and the in&s;urgents, being reinforced by the Danes, and &s;ome leaders from Scotland, attack|ed the ca&s;tle, which was defended by a garri&s;on of three thou&s;and men. Mallet, its governor, that he might the better provide for its de|fence, &s;et fire to &s;ome hou&s;es which lay conti|guous; but the fire &s;preading, the whole city was quickly in flames. This proved the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction; for the enraged inhabitants joining in the a&s;&s;ault, entered the citadel &s;word in hand, and cut off the whole garri&s;on, with|out mercy. This tran&s;ient gleam of &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to &s;pread a general &s;pirit of in&s;urrec|tion. The counties of Somer&s;et, Dor&s;et, Corn|wall, and Devon, united in the common cau&s;e,
<PB N="147" REF="157">
and determined to make one great effort for the recovery of their former freedom.</P>
<P>William, undaunted amid&s;t this &s;cene of con|fu&s;ion, a&s;&s;embled his forces, and led them to|wards the North, con&s;cious that his pre&s;ence alone would be &s;ufficient to repre&s;s the&s;e rude efforts of unadvi&s;ed indignation. According|ly, wherever he appeared, the in&s;urgents either &s;ubmitted or retired. The Danes were content to return, without committing any farther ho&s;|tilities, into Denmark. Waltheoff, who long defended York ca&s;tle, &s;ubmitted to the victor's clemency, and was taken into favour. Edric, another nobleman, who commanded the North|umbrians, made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Con|queror, and obtained pardon, while the re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves, and left the Normans undi&s;puted ma&s;ters of the whole kingdom. Edgar Atheling, who had been drawn among the re&s;t into this in&s;urrection, &s;ought a re|treat in Scotland, from the pur&s;uit of his ene|mies. There he continued, till, by proper &s;oli|citation, he was again taken into favour by the king. From that time he remained in Eng|land in a private &s;tation, content with opulence and &s;ecurity; perhaps as happy, though not &s;o &s;plendid, as if he had &s;ucceeded in the ca|reer of his ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="158">William being now acknowledged ma&s;ter of a people that more than once &s;hewed re|luctance to his government, he re&s;olved to throw off all appearance of lenity, and to inca|pacitate them from future in&s;urrections. His fir&s;t &s;tep was, to order the county of North|umberland to be laid wa&s;te, the hou&s;es to be burned, the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry to be de&s;troyed, and the inhabitants to &s;eek new ha|bitations. By this order, it is &s;aid, that above one hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed, either by the &s;word or famine, and the country is &s;up|po&s;ed, even at this day, to bear the marks of its ancient depopulation. He next proceeded to confi&s;cate all the e&s;tates of the Engli&s;h gen|try, and to grant them liberally to his Norman followers. Thus, all the ancient and honour|able families were reduced to beggary, and the Engli&s;h found them&s;elves entirely excluded from every road that led either to honour or preferment. They had the cruel mortifica|tion to find, that all his power only tended to their depre&s;&s;ion, and that the &s;cheme of their &s;ubjection was attended with every circum&s;tance of in&s;ult and indignity.</P>
<P>He was not yet, however, &s;ufficiently arbi|trary to change all the laws then in being, for tho&s;e of his own country. He only made &s;e|veral innovations, and ordered the law-pleas in
<PB N="149" REF="159">
the &s;everal courts to be made in the Norman language. Yet, with all his endeavours to make the French the popular language, the Engli&s;h &s;till gained ground; and, what de&s;erves remark, it had adopted much more of the French idiom for two or three reigns before, than during the whole line of the Norman kings &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>The feudal law had been before introduced into England by the Saxons, but this monarch reformed it, according to the model of that practi&s;ed in his native dominions. He divid|ed all the lands of England, except the royal deme&s;ne, into baronies, and conferred tho&s;e, upon certain military conditions, on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his followers. The&s;e had a power of &s;haring their grants to inferior tenants, who were denominated knights, or va&s;&s;als, and who paid their lord the &s;ame duty that he paid the &s;overeign. To the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the&s;e baro|nies the Engli&s;h were not admitted; and the few who were permitted &s;till to retain their landed property, were content to be received in the &s;econd. The Barons exerci&s;ed all kinds of juri&s;diction within their own manors, and held courts in which they admini&s;tred ju&s;tice to their own va&s;&s;als. This law extended not only to the laity, but al&s;o to the bi&s;hops and clergy.
<PB N="150" REF="160">
They had u&s;urped a power, during the Saxon &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, of being governed within them|&s;elves, but William re&s;trained them to the ex|erci&s;e of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical power only and &s;ubmitted them to a &s;imilitude of duties with the re&s;t of their fellow &s;ubjects. This they at fir&s;t regarded as a grievous impo&s;ition; but the king's authority was e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a power that neither the clergy nor the pope could intimi|date. But, to keep the clergy as much as po&s;|&s;ible in his intere&s;ts, he appointed none but his own countrymen to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable church-dignities, and even di&s;placed Stigand, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, upon &s;ome frivolous pretences. His real motive was, that &s;uch a dignity was too exalted for a native to po&s;|&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>While he thus was employed in humbling the clergy, he was no le&s;s &s;olicitous to repre&s;s many of tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious practices to which they had given countenance. He endeavoured to aboli&s;h trials by <HI>ordeal</HI> and <HI>camp-fight:</HI> the ordeal trial, which had been originally of pa|gan in&s;titution, and was &s;till held in veneration by the Saxon Chri&s;tians, was either by fire or water. It was u&s;ed in criminal ca&s;es, where the &s;u&s;picions were &s;trong, but the proofs not evident. In that of fire, the per&s;on accu&s;ed
<PB N="151" REF="161">
was brought into an open plain, and &s;everal plough-&s;hares, heated red-hot, were placed at equal intervals before him; over the&s;e he was to walk blindfold, and if he e&s;caped unhurt, he was acquitted of the charge. In the trial by water, the per&s;on accu&s;ed was thrown, bound hand and foot, into the water: if he &s;unk, he was declared innocent; if he &s;wam, he was exe|cuted, as being thus miraculou&s;ly convicted. The trial by camp-fight was performed by &s;ingle com|bat, in li&s;ts appointed for that purpo&s;e, between the accu&s;er and the accu&s;ed. He that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, came off victorious, was deemed inno|cent; and he that was conquered, if he &s;urviv|ed his antagoni&s;t's re&s;entment in the field, was &s;ure to &s;uffer as a malefactor &s;ome time after. Both the&s;e trials William aboli&s;hed, as un|chri&s;tian and unju&s;t; and he reduced all cau&s;es to the judgment of twelve men, of a rank nearly equal to that of the pri&s;oner. This method of trial, by jury, was common to the Saxons, as well as the Normans, long before; but it was now confirmed by him, with all the &s;anction of undi&s;puted authority.</P>
<P>While William was thus employed,<MILESTONE N="1071" UNIT="A.D."> in re|warding his a&s;&s;ociates, puni&s;hing the refractory, and giving laws for the benefit of all, he was threatened with an in&s;urrection in his domi|nions
<PB N="152" REF="162">
on the continent, which he thought his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s. Unwilling, howe|ver, to draw off his Norman forces from England, he carried over a con&s;iderable army, compo&s;ed al|mo&s;t entirely of Engli&s;h; and, by tho&s;e brave troops, he &s;oon reduced the revolters to &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion. Thus we &s;ee a whim&s;ical vici&s;&s;itude of fortune; the inhabitants of Normandy brought over for the conque&s;t of the Engli&s;h, and the Engli&s;h &s;ent back to conquer the Normans. However, William had not time to enjoy his &s;ucce&s;s unmole&s;ted; for accounts were quickly brought him from England, that a new con&s;piracy was formed, more dreadful, in be|ing &s;upported by the joint efforts of the Normans as well as the Engli&s;h. The adven|turers who had followed the fortunes of Wil|liam into England, had been bred in authority and independence at home, and were ill able to endure the ab&s;olute authority which this mo|narch had for &s;ome time a&s;&s;umed. The di&s;|contents were therefore become very general among the&s;e haughty nobles, and &s;ome wanted only the opportunity of his ab&s;ence to break out into open rebellion. Among the number was Roger, earl of Hereford, &s;on and heir to Fitzo&s;|borne, who had been the king's principal fa|vourite. This nobleman had, either by way
<PB N="153" REF="163">
of compliment to the king, or in compliance with &s;ome obligation of the feudal law, &s;olicited William's con&s;ent to permit the marriage of his &s;i&s;ter with Ralph de Guader, earl of Norfolk; but he was flatly refu&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, he proceeded to &s;olemnize the nuptials with great magnificence, a&s;&s;embling all his friends, and tho&s;e of Guader upon the occa&s;ion. As the pa|rents of the new married couple were well ac|quainted with the character of William, who&s;e re&s;entment they had every rea&s;on to dread, they took the opportunity, while the com|pany was heated with wine, to introduce that as a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. They inveighed again&s;t the &s;everity of his go|vernment; they ob&s;erved, that by means of his exce&s;&s;ive impo&s;itions, he had taken with one hand what he had given with the other; they affected to commi&s;erate the Engli&s;h, whom he had reduced to beggary; and aggravated the defects in his di&s;po&s;ition, which they repre&s;ent|ed as haughty and unforgiving. The gue&s;ts were ready enough at any time to concur in their com|plaints; but now, warmed by the jollity of the entertainment, they put no bounds to their zeal. They unanimou&s;ly entered into a con|&s;piracy to &s;hake off his yoke; and earl Wal|theoff him&s;elf, whom we have already &s;een par|doned upon a former in&s;urrection, was among
<PB N="154" REF="164">
the foremo&s;t on this occa&s;ion. But it was not without the greate&s;t anxiety, that he reflected in his cooler intervals upon an engagement made in the ardour of intoxication, big with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences both to him&s;elf and his coun|try. In this &s;tate of perturbation, he had re|cour&s;e to his wife, the niece of the king, and un|bo&s;omed him&s;elf to her, as he had the mo&s;t firm reliance on her fidelity. But he was deceived, for &s;he was in love with another, and only want|ed an opportunity of getting rid of her hu&s;band at any rate. She, therefore, in&s;tantly found means to communicate the whole affair to the king, taking care to repre&s;ent her hu&s;band's conduct in the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous point of light. In the mean time, Waltheoff him&s;elf gave way to his internal remor&s;e, and confe&s;&s;ed the whole con&s;piracy to Lanfranc, who exhort|ed him, by all means, to reveal it to the king; which he was at la&s;t per&s;uaded to do; but it was not till the whole affair had been divulged by his faithle&s;s con&s;ort. William coolly thank|ed him for his fidelity, but the former account of his perfidy &s;unk deep in the king's mind, and he &s;ecretly re&s;olved to puni&s;h it.</P>
<P>During this interval, the con&s;pirators being informed that Waltheoff was gone over to Normandy, ju&s;tly concluded that their de&s;igns were betrayed, and flew
<PB N="155" REF="165">
to arms before their &s;chemes were ripe for execution. The earl of Hereford was check|ed by Walter de Lacy, a great Baron, in the king's intere&s;t. The earl of Norfolk was de|feated by Odo, the king's brother; and the pri&s;oners who were taken had each the right foot cut off, in order to deter others from a &s;imili|tude of trea&s;on. The earl him&s;elf retired to Denmark; &s;o that William, upon his arrival in England, found that nothing remained for him to do, but to puni&s;h the criminals, which was performed with unu&s;ual &s;everity. Many of the rebels were hanged, &s;ome had their eyes put out, and others their hands cut off. The unfortunate Waltheoff, who had impru|dently entered into the con&s;piracy, but attempt|ed to atone for his fault by an early confe&s;&s;ion, found no mercy. He was rich, and he was an Engli&s;hman, two faults that &s;erved to aggra|vate his guilt; he was accordingly tried, con|demned, and executed. His infamous wife did not long enjoy the fruits of her perfidy; but falling &s;ome time after under the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, was abandoned by the world, and pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of her life in contempt, re|mor&s;e, and mi&s;ery. Some a&s;&s;ert, that this noble|man fell a &s;acrifice to the cruelty of Odo, not of William; but, however that may be, it is
<PB N="156" REF="166">
certain, that Waltheoff, and Fitz-Auber, a noble Norman, who was al&s;o beheaded on this occa&s;ion, were the only per&s;ons of note that were executed during the reign of William the Conqueror. Having thus re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the peace of his government, and extingui&s;hed the la&s;t embers of rebellion with blood, William returned once more to the continent, in order to pur&s;ue Guader, who, e&s;caping from England, had taken refuge with the count of Bretagne. Finding him, however, too powerfully protect|ed by that prince, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting his vengence, he wi&s;ely came to a treaty with the count, in which Guader was included.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1076" UNIT="A.D."> William, having thus &s;ecured the peace of his dominions, now expected re&s;t from his labours; and finding none either willing or powerful enough to oppo&s;e him, he hoped that the end of his reign would be marked with pro&s;perity and peace. But &s;uch is the blind|ne&s;s of human hope, that he found enemies where he lea&s;t expected them, and &s;uch too as &s;erved to embitter all the latter part of his life. His la&s;t troubles were excited by his own chil|dren, from the oppo&s;ing of whom he could ex|pect to reap neither glory nor gain. He had four &s;ons Robert, Richard, Will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">am, and Henry, be&s;ides &s;everal daughters. Robert, his elde&s;t
<PB N="157" REF="167">
&s;on, &s;urnamed Curtho&s;e, from the &s;hortne&s;s of his legs, was a prince who inherited all the bravery of his family and nation, but was rather bold than prudent, rather enterprizing than politic. Earne&s;t after fame, and even impatient that his father &s;hould &s;tand in the way, he a&s;|pired at that independence to which his tem|per, as well as &s;ome circum&s;tances in his &s;itua|tion, con&s;pired to invite him. He had formerly been promi&s;ed by his father the government of Maine, a province of France, which had &s;ubmit|ted to William, and was al&s;o declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the dukedom of Normandy. However, when he came to demand the execution of the&s;e en|gagements, he received an ab&s;olute denial; the king, &s;hrewdly ob&s;erving, that it was not his cu&s;tom to throw off his cloaths till he went to bed. Robert openly declared his re&s;entment, and was often heard to expre&s;s his jealou&s;y of his two &s;urviving brothers, William and Henry, for Richard was killed, in hunting, by a &s;tag. The&s;e, by greater a&s;&s;iduity, had wrought upon the credulity and affections of the king, and con&s;equently were the more obnoxious to Ro|bert. A mind, therefore, &s;o well prepared for re&s;entment, &s;oon found, or made a cau&s;e for an open rupture. The princes were one day in &s;port together, and, in the idle petu|lance of play, took it in their head to throw
<PB N="158" REF="168">
water upon their elder brother as he pa&s;&s;ed through the court, on leaving their apartment. Robert, all alive to &s;u&s;picion, quickly turned this idle frolic into a &s;tudied indignity; and having the&s;e jealou&s;ies &s;till farther enflamed by one of his favourites, he drew his &s;word, and ran up &s;tairs with an intent to take revenge. The whole ca&s;tle was quickly filled with tumult, and it was not without &s;ome difficulty, that the king him&s;elf was able to appea&s;e it. But he could not allay the animo&s;ity, which, from that moment, ever after prevailed in his family. Robert, attended by &s;everal of his confederates, withdrew to Rouen that very night, hoping to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle, but his de&s;ign was defeated by the governor.</P>
<P>The flame being thus kindled, the popular character of the prince, and a &s;ympathy of man|ners, engaged all the young nobility of Nor|mandy and Maine, as well as of Anjou and Brittany, to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel; even his mo|ther, it is &s;aid, &s;upported him by &s;ecret remit|tances, and aided him in this ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance by private encouragement. This unnatural con|te&s;t continued for &s;everal years to enflame the Norman &s;tate; and William was at la&s;t obliged to have recour&s;e to England for &s;upporting his authority again&s;t his &s;on. Accordingly, drawing an army of Engli&s;hmen together, he
<PB N="159" REF="169">
led them over into Normandy, where he &s;oon compelled Robert and his adherents to quit the field, and he was quickly rein&s;tated in all his do|minions. As for Robert, he being no longer able to re&s;i&s;t his father, was obliged to take &s;helter in the ca&s;tle of Gerberoy, which the king of France had provided for him, where he was &s;hortly after be&s;ieged by his father. As the gar|ri&s;on was &s;trong, and con&s;cious of guilt, they made a mo&s;t gallant defence; and many were the &s;kirmi&s;hes and duels that were fought under its walls. In one of the&s;e, accident brought the king and his &s;on together; but, being both con|cealed by their helmets, they attacked each other with mutual fury. A fierce and dreadful com|bat en&s;ued between them, till at la&s;t the young prince wounded his father in the arm, and threw him from his hor&s;e. The next blow would, in all probability, have put an end to the king's life, had not he cried out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Robert then immediately recollected his father's voice, and at once &s;tung with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his crime, he leaped from his hor&s;e, and rai&s;ed the fallen monarch from the ground. He then pro|&s;trated him&s;elf in his pre&s;ence, and craved par|don for his offences, promi&s;ing, for the fu|ture, a &s;trict adherence to his duty. The re|&s;entment harboured by the king was not &s;o
<PB N="160" REF="170">
ea&s;ily appea&s;ed; perhaps, his indignation at being overcome, added to his anger; in|&s;tead, therefore, of pardoning his &s;on, he gave him his malediction, and departed for his own camp on Robert's hor&s;e, which the prince had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to mount. However, the conduct of the &s;on &s;erved, after &s;ome recollection, to ap|pea&s;e the father. As &s;oon as William was return|ed to Rouen, he became reconciled to Robert, and carried him with him into England, where he was &s;ucce&s;sfully employed in retaliating an inva&s;ion of Malcolm king of Scotland.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1081" UNIT="A.D."> William, being thus freed from foreign and dome&s;tic enemies, now began to have &s;ufficient lei&s;ure for a more attentive application to the duties of peace. For this purpo&s;e, the Doom&s;|day Book was compiled by his order, which contains a general &s;urvey of all the lands in the kingdom; their extent in each di&s;trict; their proprietors, tenures, value, the quantity of meadow, pa&s;ture, wood, and arable land, which they contained; and in &s;ome counties, the num|ber of tenants, cottagers, and people of all de|nominations, who lived upon them. This de|tail enabled him to regulate the taxations in &s;uch a manner, that all the inhabitants were compelled to bear their duties in proportion to their abilities.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="171">He was no le&s;s careful of the methods of &s;aving money, than of accumulation. He re|&s;erved a very ample revenue for the crown; and, in the general di&s;tribution of land among his followers, he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no le&s;s than four|teen hundred manors in different parts of the country. Such was his income, that it is ju&s;t|ly &s;aid to have exceeded that of any Engli&s;h prince either before or &s;ince his time. No king of England was ever &s;o opulent; none &s;o able to &s;upport the &s;plendor and magnificence of a court; none had &s;o many places of tru&s;t and pro|fit to be&s;tow; and none, con&s;equently, had his commands attended with &s;uch implicit obe|dience.</P>
<P>There was one plea&s;ure to which William, as well as all the Normans and ancient Saxons was addicted, which was hunting. To in|dulge this in its utmo&s;t extent, he depopulated the county of Hamp&s;hire for thirty miles, turn|ing out the inhabitants, de&s;troying all the vil|lages, and making the wretched out-ca&s;ts no compen&s;ation for &s;uch a injury. In the time of the Saxon kings, all noblemen without di&s;|tinction had a right to hunt in the royal fo|re&s;ts; but William appropriated all the&s;e, and publi&s;hed very &s;evere laws to prohibit his &s;ub|jects from encroaching on this part of his pre|rogative.
<PB N="162" REF="172">
The killing of a deer, a boar, or even an hare, was puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of the delin|quent's eyes; at a time, when the killing of a man might be atoned for by paying a mode|rate fine or compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>As the king's wealth and power were &s;o great, it may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that the riches of his mini&s;ters were in proportion. Tho&s;e of his uterine brother Odo, bi&s;hop of Bayeux, were &s;o great, that he re&s;olved to purcha&s;e the Pa|pacy. For this purpo&s;e, taking the opportuni|ty of William's ab&s;ence he equipped a ve&s;&s;el at the i&s;le of Wight, on board of which he &s;ent immen&s;e trea&s;ures, and prepared for his em|barkation, but he was unfortunately detained by contrary winds. In the mean time, William having had intimation of his de&s;ign, re&s;olv|ed to prevent the exportation of &s;o much wealth from his dominions. Accordingly re|turning from Normandy, where he was then em|ployed, he came into England at the very in&s;tant his brother was &s;tepping on board, and imme|diately ordered him to be made a pri&s;oner. His attendants, however, re&s;pecting the immunities of the church, &s;crupled to execute his com|mands; &s;o that the king him&s;elf was obliged with his own hand to &s;eize him. Odo, di&s;con|certed at &s;o unexpected an intervention, ap|pealed

to the Pope; who, he alledged, was the only per&s;on upon earth to try a bi&s;hop. To this the king replied, that he did not &s;eize him as bi&s;hop of Bayeux, but as earl of Kent; and in that capacity he expected, and would have an account of his admini&s;tration. He was, therefore, &s;ent pri&s;oner into Normandy; and notwith&s;tanding all the remon&s;trances and threats of Gregory, he was detained in cu&s;tody during the remainder of William's reign.</P>
<P>William had &s;carcely put an end to this tran&s;action, when he felt a very &s;evere blow in the death of Matilda, his queen; and, as misfortunes generally come together, he receiv|ed information of a general in&s;urrection in Maine, the nobility of which had been always aver&s;e to the Norman government: upon his arrival on the continent, he found, that the in|&s;urgents had been &s;ecretly a&s;&s;i&s;ted and excited by the king of France, who&s;e policy con&s;i&s;ted in thus le&s;&s;ening the Norman power, by creat|ing di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the nobles of its diffe|rent provinces. William's di&s;plea&s;ure was not a little encrea&s;ed, by the account he received of &s;ome railleries which that monarch had thrown out again&s;t him. It &s;eems, that Wil|liam, who was become corpulent, had been de|tained in bed &s;ome time by &s;ickne&s;s; and Philip was heard to &s;ay, that he only lay in of
<PB N="164" REF="174">
a big belly. This &s;o provoked the Engli&s;h monarch, that he &s;ent him word, he would &s;oon be up, and would at his churching pre&s;ent &s;uch a number of tapers, as would &s;et the king|dom of France in a flame.</P>
<P>In order to perform this promi&s;e, he le|vied a &s;trong army, and entering the i&s;le of France, de&s;troyed and burned all the villages and hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition. He took the town of Mante, which he reduced to a&s;hes. But the progre&s;s of the&s;e ho&s;tilities was &s;topped by an accident, which &s;hortly after put an end to William's life. His hor&s;e chanc|ing to place his fore-feet on &s;ome hot a&s;hes, plunged &s;o violently, that the rider was thrown forward, and brui&s;ed upon the pummel of the &s;addle to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;uffered a relap&s;e, and was obliged to return to Rouen. Finding his illne&s;s encrea&s;e, and being &s;en&s;ible of the approach of death, he began to turn his eyes to a future &s;tate, from which the pur&s;uit of ambition had long averted them. He was now &s;truck with remor&s;e for all the cruelties and depredations he had made: he endeavour|ed to atone for his former offences, by large pre&s;ents to churches and mona&s;teries, and by giving liberty to many pri&s;oners whom he unju&s;tly detained. He was even prevailed on, though not without reluc|tance,
<PB N="165" REF="175">
to con&s;ent, with his dying breath, to the deliverance of his brother Odo, again&s;t whom he was extremely incen&s;ed. He then bequeath|ed Normandy and Le Maine to his elde&s;t &s;on Robert, whom he never loved; to Henry, he left five thou&s;and pounds, and his mother's jointure, without the &s;malle&s;t territory; and though he would not pretend to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown of England, to which he now began to perceive that he had no title, he expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h that it might devolve to his favourite &s;on William, whom he imme|diately di&s;patched with letters to the archbi|&s;hop of Canterbury, de&s;iring his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Having thus regulated his temporal affairs, he was conveyed in a litter to a little village near Rouen, where he might &s;ettle the concerns of his &s;oul without, noi&s;e or interruption. It was there that he died, in the &s;ixty-fir&s;t year of his age, after having reigned fifty-two in Normandy, and twenty-one in England. His body was interred in the church at Caen, which he him&s;elf had founded; but his inter|ment was attended with a remarkable circum|&s;tance. As the body was carrying to the grave, the prelates and prie&s;ts attending with the mo&s;t awful &s;ilence, a man, who &s;tood upon an emi|nence, was heard to cry out with a loud voice, and to forbid the interment of the body, in a &s;pot
<PB N="166" REF="176">
that had been unju&s;tly &s;eized by the con|queror. That very place, cried the man, is the area of my father's hou&s;e; and I now &s;ummon the departed &s;oul before the divine tribunal to do me ju&s;tice, and to atone for &s;o great an op|pre&s;&s;ion. The bi&s;hops and attendants were &s;truck with the man's intrepid conduct; they enquired into the truth of his charge, and find|ing it ju&s;t, agreed to &s;atisfy him for the damages he had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>William was a prince of great courage and capacity. Ambitious, politic, cruel, vin|dictive, and rapacious. He was fond of glory, and par&s;imonious merely for the purpo&s;es of o&s;tentation. Though &s;udden and impetuous in his enterprizes, he was cool, deliberate, and indefatigable in times of danger. He is &s;aid, by the Norman writers, to be above eight feeet high, his body &s;trong built, and well proportioned, and his &s;trength &s;uch, that none of his courtiers could draw his bow. He talked little; he was &s;eldom affable to any, except to Lanfranc, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; with him, he was ever meek and gentle; with all others, &s;tern and au&s;tere. Though he rendered him&s;elf formidable to all, and odious to many, yet he had policy &s;ufficient to tran&s;mit his power to po&s;terity, and the throne is &s;till occupied by his de&s;cendants.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. VI. WILLIAM RUFUS.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM, &s;urnamed RUFUS,<MILESTONE N="1087" UNIT="A.D."> from the colour of his hair, had no &s;ooner received the late king's letter to Lanfranc, in his favour, than he ha&s;tened to take mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring him|&s;elf on the throne. Arriving, therefore, before the news of William's death had yet reached Eng|land, his fir&s;t care was, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the trea&s;ure left by the king at Winche&s;ter, which a|mounted
<PB N="168" REF="178">
to the &s;um of &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds. He then addre&s;&s;ed the primate, who had always con&s;idered him with an eye of peculiar affec|tion; and who now, finding the ju&s;tne&s;s of his claim, in&s;tantly proceeded to the ceremony of his coronation. At the &s;ame time Robert, who had been appointed &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Normandy, took peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that government; where his per&s;on was loved, and his acce&s;&s;ion long de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In the beginning of William the Second's reign, the Engli&s;h began to think they had hitherto mi&s;taken this prince's character, who had always appeared to them rude and brutal. He at fir&s;t &s;eemed to pay the utmo&s;t regard to the coun|cils of Lanfranc, the primate, which were mild and gentle, and con&s;tantly calculated for the benefit of the nation. Neverthele&s;s, the Norman barons, who knew him better, perceiv|ed that he kept his di&s;po&s;ition under an unna|tural re&s;traint, and that he only waited an op|portunity for throwing off the ma&s;k when his power &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed. They were, from the beginning, di&s;plea&s;ed at the divi&s;ion of the empire by the late king; they eagerly de&s;ired an union as before, and looked upon Robert as the proper owner of the whole. The natu|ral di&s;po&s;ition al&s;o of this prince was as plea&s;ing
<PB N="169" REF="179">
to them, as that of William his brother was odious. Robert was open, generous, and hu|mane; he carried his facility to an exce&s;s, as he could &s;carcely find &s;trength of mind to give any of his adherents the mortification of a re|fu&s;al. But this was a quality no way di&s;agree|able to tho&s;e who expected to build their am|bition on the ea&s;y pliancy of his temper. A powerful con&s;piracy was therefore carried on again&s;t William; and Odo, the late king's bro|ther, undertook to conduct it to maturity.</P>
<P>William, &s;en&s;ible of the danger that threat|ened him on all &s;ides, endeavoured to gain the affections of the native Engli&s;h, whom he pre|vailed upon, by promi&s;es of future good treat|ment, and preference in the di&s;tribution of his favours, to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts. He was &s;oon therefore in the field; and, at the head of a nu|merous army, &s;hewed him&s;elf in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e all who &s;hould di&s;pute his preten&s;ions. In the mean time, Odo had written to Robert an account of the con&s;piracy in his favour, urging him to u&s;e di&s;patch, and exciting him, by the greatne&s;s of the danger, and the &s;plen|dor of the reward. Robert gave him the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances of &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but his indolence was not to be excited by di&s;tant ex|pectations. In&s;tead of employing his money
<PB N="170" REF="180">
in levies, to &s;upport his friends in England, he &s;quandered it away in idle expences, and un|merited benefits, &s;o that he procra&s;tinated his departure till the opportunity was lo&s;t; while William exerted him&s;elf with incredible acti|vity, to di&s;&s;ipate the confederacy before he could arrive. Nor was this difficult to effect: the con&s;pirators had, in con&s;equence of Robert's a&s;&s;urances, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fortre&s;&s;es; but the appearance of the king &s;oon reduced them to implore for mercy. He granted them their lives, but confi&s;cated all their e&s;tates, and bani&s;hed them the kingdom.</P>
<P>William, thus freed from all danger of in&s;ur|rection, and fixed in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom, &s;hewed the fir&s;t in&s;tance of his perver&s;e inclinations, in his ingratitude to the Engli&s;h, who had &s;ecured him on the throne. The death of Lanfranc, which followed &s;hortly after, took off all re&s;traint from his inclina|tions, and his mind now appeared in its natu|ral deformity, tyrannical, and unju&s;t. He or|dered a new &s;urvey to be taken of all the lands and property of the kingdom; and wherever he found them undervalued in the Doom's-day-book, he rai&s;ed the proportion of taxes ac|cordingly. Even the privileges of the church, which were held very &s;acred in tho&s;e times of
<PB N="171" REF="181">
ignorance, were but a feeble rampart again&s;t his u&s;urpations; he &s;eized the vacant bi&s;hop|ricks, and openly put to &s;ale &s;uch abbies as he thought proper. But, not content|ed with exerting his tyranny over his own dominions, he was re&s;olved to extend his autho|rity over tho&s;e of his brother. In con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, he appeared in Normandy, at the head of a numerous army; but the no|bility, on both &s;ides, &s;trongly connected by in|tere&s;t and alliances, brought on an accommo|dation. Among other articles of this treaty, it was agreed, that, in ca&s;e either of the brothers &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, the &s;urvivor &s;hould in|herit all his dominions. It was in vain that Henry, the other brother, remon&s;trated again&s;t this act of inju&s;tice; it was in vain that he took arms, and even defended a little fortre&s;s, on the coa&s;t of Normandy, for &s;ome time, again&s;t their united a&s;&s;aults. He was at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender; and, being de&s;poiled of even the &s;mall patrimony that was left him, he wandered about for &s;ome years, with a few attendants, and was often reduced to great poverty.</P>
<P>It was in be&s;ieging this fortre&s;s, that a circum|&s;tance or two have been related, which &s;erve to mark the character of the two brothers. As Wil|liam was taking the air one day on hor&s;eback, at
<PB N="172" REF="182">
&s;ome di&s;tance from the camp, perceived two hor&s;emen riding out from the ca&s;tle, who &s;oon came up and attacked him. In the very fir&s;t encounter, the king's hor&s;e being killed, over|turned, and lay upon him, in &s;uch a manner that he could not di&s;engage him&s;elf. His an|tagoni&s;t, while he remained in this &s;ituation, lifted up his arm to di&s;patch him; when Wil|liam exclaimed, in a menacing tone, <Q REND="inline">"Hold, villain, I am the king of England."</Q> The two &s;oldiers were immediatly &s;eized with veneration and awe; and, helping him up, accommodated him with one of their hor&s;es. William was not ungrateful for this &s;ervice; he mounted the hor&s;e, and ordering the &s;oldier to fol|low, took him into his &s;ervice. Soon after, Robert had an occa&s;ion to &s;hew &s;till greater marks of genero&s;ity; for, hearing that the gar|ri&s;on was in great di&s;tre&s;s for want of water, he not only ordered that Henry &s;hould be per|mitted to &s;upply him&s;elf, but al&s;o &s;ent him &s;ome pipes of wine for his own table. Rufus did not at all approve of this ill-timed genero|&s;ity; but Robert an&s;wered his remon&s;trances by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Shall we &s;uffer our brother to die with thir&s;t! Where &s;hall we find another when he is gone?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="183">The inte&s;tine and petty di&s;cords that en&s;ued upon this accommodation between Robert and Rufus, &s;eem &s;carce worthy the attention of hi&s;tory. They indeed produced more real calamities to the people than &s;plendid inva&s;ions, or bloody battles, as the depredations of petty tyrants are ever more &s;everely felt by the poor, than the magnanimous projects of ambition. A rup|ture en&s;ued between Rufus and Malcolm, king of Scotland, in which the latter was ultimately &s;urprized, and &s;lain, by a party from Alnwick ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>A new breach was made &s;ome time after be|tween the brothers,<MILESTONE N="1093" UNIT="A.D."> in which Rufus found means to encroach &s;till further upon Robert's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. An incur&s;ion from the Welch filled the country of England with alarm; <MILESTONE N="1094" UNIT="A.D."> but they were quickly repelled, and obliged to find refuge in their na|tive mountains. A con&s;piracy of the Norman barons in England threatened &s;erious con&s;e|quences; but their &s;chemes were prevented and fru&s;trated. Robert Mowbray, earl of North|umberland, who was at the head of this plot, was thrown into pri&s;on, where he died, after thirty years confinement. The count Eu, an|other con&s;pirator, denying the charge, fought with his accu&s;er, in pre&s;ence of the court, at Wind&s;or, and being wor&s;ted in the combat, was
<PB N="174" REF="184">
condemned to be ca&s;trated, and to have his eyes put out. Every con&s;piracy, thus detected, &s;erved to enrich the king, who took care to ap|ply to his own u&s;e tho&s;e trea&s;ures that had been ama&s;&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of dethroning him.</P>
<P>But the memory of the&s;e tran&s;ient broils, and un&s;ucce&s;sful trea&s;ons, were now totally eclip&s;ed by one of the mo&s;t noted enterprizes that ever adorned the annals of nations, or excited the attention of mankind. I mean the Cru&s;ades, which were now fir&s;t projected. Peter the Hermit, a native of Amiens, in Picardy, was a man of great zeal, courage, and piety. He had made a pilgrimage to the holy &s;epulchre at Jeru&s;alem, and beheld, with indignation, the cruel manner in which the Chri&s;tians were treat|ed by the Infidels, who were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place. Unable to &s;uppre&s;s his re&s;entment, upon his return, he entertained the bold de&s;ign of freeing the whole country from the Maho|metan yoke, and of re&s;toring to the Chri&s;tians the land where their religion was fir&s;t propa|gated. He fir&s;t propo&s;ed his views to Martin II. at that time pope, who permitted, rather than a&s;&s;i&s;ted, this bold enthu&s;ia&s;t in his aims. Peter, therefore, warmed with a zeal that knew no bounds, began to preach the Cru&s;ade, and to excite the princes of Chri&s;tendom to the re|covery
<PB N="175" REF="185">
of the Holy-land. Bare-headed, and bare-footed, he travelled from court to court, preaching as he went, and inflaming the zeal of every rank of people. The fame of this de&s;ign being thus diffu&s;ed, prelates, nobles, and princes, concurred in &s;econding it; and, at a council held at Clermont, where the pope him|&s;elf exhorted to the undertaking, the whole a&s;|&s;embly cried out with one voice, as if by in|&s;piration, <HI>It is the will of God. It is the will of God.</HI> From that time, nothing was &s;een but an univer&s;al migration of the we&s;tern nations into the ea&s;t; men of all ranks flew to arms with the utmo&s;t alacrity, and bore the &s;ign of the cro&s;s upon their right &s;houlder, as a mark of their devotion to the cau&s;e. In the mid&s;t of this uni|ver&s;al ardour that was diffu&s;ed over Europe, men were not entirely forgetful of their tem|poral intere&s;ts; for &s;ome, hoping a more magnificent &s;ettlement in the &s;oft regions of A&s;ia, &s;old their European property for what|ever they could obtain, contented with receiv|ing any thing for what they were predetermin|ed to relinqui&s;h. Among the princes who felt and acknowledged this general &s;pirit of enterprize, was Robert, duke of Normandy. The Cru&s;ade was entirely adapted to his inclinations, and his circum&s;tances; he was brave, zealous, covetous
<PB N="176" REF="186">
of glory, harra&s;&s;ed by in&s;urrections, and, what was more than all, naturally fond of change. In order, therefore, to &s;upply money to defray the nece&s;&s;ary charges of &s;o expen&s;ive an under|taking, he offered to mortgage his dukedom of Normandy to his brother Rufus for a &s;tipulat|ed &s;um of money. This &s;um, which was no greater than ten thou&s;and marks, was readily promi&s;ed by Rufus, who&s;e ambition was upon the watch to &s;eize every advantage. He was no way &s;olicitous about rai&s;ing the money, as he knew the riches of his clergy. From them, therefore, he forced the whole; heedle&s;s of their murmurs, and aggravating his inju&s;tice by the pious pretences he made u&s;e of to cover his extortions: thus equipping his brother for his romantic expedition to the Holy-land, he, more wi&s;ely, and more &s;afely, took peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dukedom at home.</P>
<P>In this manner was Normandy once more united to England; and from this union, af|terwards, aro&s;e tho&s;e numerous wars with France, which, for whole centuries, continued to depopulate both nations, without conducing in the end to encrea&s;e the power of either. However, Rufus was not a little plea&s;ed with this acqui&s;ition; he made a voyage to his new dominion, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for five
<PB N="177" REF="187">
year, according to agreement with his brother.<MILESTONE N="1095" UNIT="A.D."> He al&s;o demanded of the king of France a part of the territory of Vexin, which, he pretend|ed, was an appurtenance to his duchy, and even attempted to enforce his claims by arms. But, though the ce&s;&s;ion of Maine and Normandy greatly encrea&s;ed the king's territories, they added but little to his real power, as his new &s;ubjects were compo&s;ed of men of independent &s;pirits, more ready to di&s;pute than obey his commands. Many were the revolts and in&s;ur|rections which he was obliged to quell in per|&s;on; and, no &s;ooner was one con&s;piracy &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, than another ro&s;e to give him fre&s;h di&s;quietude.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e foreign troubles, he found him&s;elf involved in a di&s;agreeable quar|rel with An&s;elm, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, a prelate of an haughty di&s;po&s;ition, and extreme|ly tenacious of the rights of the church. There was at that time a &s;chi&s;m in the church, be|tween Urban and Clement, who both pretend|ed to the papacy; and An&s;elm, who had al|ready acknowledged Urban, was determined, without the king's con&s;ent, to introduce his au|thority into England. William, who, imitat|ing his father's example, had prohibited his &s;ubjects from recognizing any pope whom he
<PB N="178" REF="188">
had not preriou&s;ly approved, was enraged at An&s;elm's preten&s;ions. A &s;ynod was &s;ummoned at Rockingham, for depo&s;ing the prelate; but, in&s;tead of obeying the king, the members of it declared, that none but the pope could inflict a cen&s;ure on their primate. To this was &s;oon after added a fre&s;h offence. An&s;elm being re|quired to furni&s;h his quota of &s;oldiers, for an intended expedition again&s;t the Wel&s;h, reluc|tantly complied; but he &s;ent them &s;o ill equip|ped, that Rufus threatened him with a pro&s;e|cution. As the re&s;entments on both &s;ides were encrea&s;ed, their mutual demands were rai&s;ed in proportion, till at length their anger pro|ceeded to recrimination; and An&s;elm, finding it dangerous to remain in the kingdom, de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to retire to Rome. This reque&s;t the king very readily complied with; but, in order to mortify the prelate yet more, he &s;ent an officer to &s;earch his baggage, after he was on board, and to &s;eize all his money, on pretence of a law which forbad the exportation of &s;il|ver. Not content with this, he ordered all his temporalities to be confi&s;cated, and actually kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them the remaining part of his life.</P>
<P>This open infringement of what were then con&s;idered as rights of the church, &s;erved
<PB N="179" REF="189">
to unite the pope, as well as all the eccle&s;ia&s;|ticks of his own dominions, again&s;t him. Ur|ban even menaced him with the &s;entence of ex|communication; but he was too earne&s;tly en|gaged in the cru&s;ade, to attend to any other bu&s;ine&s;s. Rufus, therefore, little regarded tho&s;e cen&s;ures, which he found were ineffectual; he had but very little religion at be&s;t, and the amazing infatuation of the times in&s;pired him with no very high ideas of the wi&s;dom of its profe&s;&s;ors. It is reported of him, that he once accepted &s;ixty marks of a Jew, who&s;e &s;on had been converted to Chri&s;tianity, and who en|gaged him by that pre&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bring|ing back the youth to Judai&s;m. William em|ployed both menaces and per&s;ua&s;ion to that purpo&s;e; but finding his efforts ineffectual, he &s;ent for the father, and informing him that the new convert was ob&s;tinate in his faith, he re|turned him half the money, and kept the re&s;t for his pains. At another time, he is &s;aid to have &s;ent for &s;ome learned Chri&s;tian theolo|gians and &s;ome Jewi&s;h rabbies, and bade them&punc; fairly di&s;pute the points of their religion before him. He was perfectly indifferent, he &s;aid, which &s;hould prevail; he had his ears open to both, and he would embrace that doc|trine, which, upon compari&s;on, &s;hould be
<PB N="180" REF="190">
found &s;upported on the mo&s;t &s;olid argu|ments.</P>
<P>In this manner Rufus proceeded, carele&s;s of approbation or cen&s;ure; and only intent upon extending his dominions, either by purcha&s;e or conque&s;t. The earl of Poictiers and Guienne, en|flamed with a de&s;ire of going upon the cru&s;ade, had gathered an immen&s;e multitude for that expedition, but wanted money to forward his preparations. He had recour&s;e, therefore, to Rufus; and offered to mortgage all his domi|nions, without much con&s;idering what would become of his unhappy &s;ubjects that he thus di&s;po&s;ed of. The king accepted this offer with his u&s;ual avidity; and had prepared a fleet, and an army, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rich provinces thus con&s;igned to his tru&s;t. But an accident put an end to all his ambitious projects, and &s;erved to rid the world of a mer|cenary tyrant. His favourite amu&s;ement was hunting, almo&s;t the only relaxation of princes in tho&s;e rude times, when the other arts of peace were but little cultivated. The New Fore&s;t was generally the &s;cene of his &s;port; and there he u&s;ually &s;pent tho&s;e hours which were not employed in bu&s;ine&s;s of a more &s;erious nature. One day, as he was mounting his hor&s;e, in or|der to take his cu&s;tomary amu&s;ement, he is
<PB N="181" REF="191">
&s;aid to have been &s;topped by a monk, who warned him, from &s;ome dreams he had the night before, to ab&s;tain from that day's diver|&s;ion. Rufus, &s;miling at his &s;uper&s;tition, or|dered him to be paid for his zeal, but de&s;ired him to have more favourable dreams for the future. Thus, &s;etting forward, he began the chace, attended by Walter Tyrrel, a French knight, famous for archery, who always accom|panied him in the&s;e excur&s;ions. Towards &s;un|&s;et, they found them&s;elves &s;eparated from the re&s;t of their retinue; and the king di&s;mounted, either through fatigue, or in expectation of a fre&s;h hor&s;e. Ju&s;t at that in&s;tant, a &s;tag bound|ed out before him; and Rufus, drawing his bow, wounded the animal, yet not &s;o mortal|ly but that it fled; while he followed, in hopes of &s;eeing it fall. As the &s;etting &s;un beamed in his face, he held up his hand before his eyes, and &s;tood in that po&s;ture; when Tyr|rel, who had been engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uit, let fly an arrow, which glancing from a tree, &s;truck the king to the heart. He dropt dead in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; while the innocent author of his death, terrified at the accident, put &s;purs to his hor&s;e, ha&s;tened to the &s;ea-&s;hore, embarked for France, and joined the cru&s;ade that was then &s;etting out for Jeru&s;alem.

body, being found by &s;ome countrymen pa&s;|&s;ing through the fore&s;t, it was laid acro&s;s an hor&s;e, and carried to Winche&s;ter, where it was, next day, interred in the cathedral, without ce|remony, or any marks of re&s;pect.

<P><MILESTONE N="1100" UNIT="A.D."> It requires no great art to draw the charac|ter of a prince, who&s;e vices were compen&s;ated by &s;carce one virtue. Rufus was a per&s;idious, encroaching, and a dangerous neighbour, an un|kind and ungenerous relation, a rapacious, and yet a prodigal prince. However, there remains to this day, &s;ome monuments of his public &s;pi|rit; the Tower, We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, and Lon|don-bridge, were all built by him, and are evi|dences that the trea&s;ures of government were not all expended in vain.

As he never was married, he left no legitimate i&s;&s;ue behind him; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, therefore, of cour&s;e de|volved upon Robert, his elder brother, but he was then too di&s;tant to a&s;&s;ert his preten&s;ions.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. VII. HENRY I. &s;urnamed BEAUCLERC.</HEAD>
<P>THERE were now two competitors for the crown; Robert, who had engaged in the holy war, and Henry, the younge&s;t brother, who continued at home. Had Robert been in Normandy when William died, there is no doubt, from the popularity of his charac|ter, and from the treaty formerly concluded between the two brothers, but that he would
<PB N="184" REF="194">
have been elected without oppo&s;ition. This valiant and generous prince having led his fol|lowers into Pale&s;tine, and there di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his courage, his affable di&s;po&s;ition, and unbounded genero&s;ity, after the taking of Jeru&s;alem, began to think of returning home, and of enjoying in tranquillity that glory, which he had acquired in the field again&s;t the infidels. But, in&s;tead of taking the mo&s;t di|rect road to England, he pa&s;&s;ed through Italy, where he became acquainted with Sibylla, daughter of count Conver&s;ana, a lady of cele|brated beauty; and, marrying her, he lavi&s;hed away, in her company, tho&s;e hours which &s;hould have been employed in the recovery of his kingdom.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Henry, who had been hunting in the New Fore&s;t when his brother was &s;lain, took the earlie&s;t advantage of the occa&s;ion, and ha&s;tening to Winche&s;ter, re&s;olv|ed to &s;ecure the royal trea&s;ure, which he knew to be the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant in &s;econding his aims. William de Breteuil, who had the care of the trea&s;ury, informed of the king's death, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf boldly to Henry's preten&s;ions. He ventured to a&s;&s;ure Henry, that the money in his cu&s;tody, as well as the crown, belonged to his elder brother, and that he was re&s;olved
<PB N="185" REF="195">
to continue firm in his ju&s;t allegiance. The di&s;pute was on the point of producing blood|&s;hed, when &s;everal of Henry's partizans arriv|ing, compelled Breteuil to &s;urrender the trea|&s;ure, with a part of which, they in all probabili|ty, hoped to be rewarded for their &s;ervice. Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this, without lo&s;ing time, he next ha&s;tened to London, where he procured him|&s;elf to be proclaimed king, and in&s;tantly pro|ceeded to the exerci&s;e of his royal dignity. The barons, as well as the people, acquie&s;ced in a claim which they were unprovided to re&s;i&s;t, and yielded obedience from the fears of imme|diate danger.</P>
<P>When ever there is a di&s;puted throne, the people generally become umpires, and thus re|gain a part of tho&s;e natural rights of which they might have been deprived. Henry ea&s;ily fore|&s;aw, that to &s;ecure his u&s;urped title, his &s;ub|jects were to be indulged, and that his power could only find &s;ecurity in their affections. His fir&s;t care, therefore, was to make &s;everal con|ce&s;&s;ions in their favour. He granted them a charter, e&s;tabli&s;hing the churches in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their immunities, aboli&s;hing tho&s;e exce&s;|&s;ive fines which u&s;ed to be exacted from heirs; granting his barons, and military tenants, the power of bequeathing their money by will, re|mitting
<PB N="186" REF="196">
all debts due to the crown; offering a pardon for all former offences, and promi&s;ing to confirm and ob&s;erve all the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions plea&s;ed the clergy and the people, while the king, who meant only to ob&s;erve them while his power was in di&s;pute, boa&s;ted of the lenity of his go|verment.</P>
<P>Still farther to ingratiate him&s;elf with the people, Henry expelled from court all the mini&s;ters of his brother's debauchery and arbi|trary power; he &s;tripped Ralph Flambard, who had been his brother's principal favourite, and, con&s;equently, obnoxious to the people, of his dignity, and had him confined to the Tower. But what gave him the greate&s;t &s;hare of popularity, was his recalling An&s;elm, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had been bani&s;hed during the la&s;t reign, to his former dignity and his favour. One thing only remained to con|firm his claims without danger of a rival. The Engli&s;h &s;till remembered their Saxon monarchs with gratitude, and beheld them excluded the throne with regret. There &s;till remained &s;ome of the de&s;cendants of that favourite line; and, a|mong others, Matilda, the niece of Edgar Athel|ing; which lady, having declined all preten&s;ions to royalty, was bred up in a convent, and had
<PB N="187" REF="197">
actually taken the veil. Upon her Henry fir&s;t fixed his eyes as a proper con&s;ort, by who&s;e means, the long breach between the Saxon and Norman intere&s;ts would be finally united. It only remained to get over the &s;cruple of her be|ing a nun; but this a council, devoted to his intere&s;ts, readily admitted; and Matilda being pronounced free to marry, the nup|tials were celebrated with great pomp and &s;o|lemnity.</P>
<P>It was at this unfavourable juncture, that Robert returned from abroad, and after tak|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his native dominions, laid his claim to the crown of England. But he was now, as in all his former attempts, too late for &s;ucce&s;s. However, as he was a man of undaunt|ed re&s;olution, he &s;eemed re&s;olved to di&s;pute his preten&s;ions to the la&s;t; and the great fame he had acquired in the Ea&s;t, did not a little &s;erve to forward, his endeavours. He was al&s;o ex|cited to the&s;e re&s;olutions by Flambard, who had e&s;caped from the Tower; together with &s;everal others, as well of the Norman as the Engli&s;h nobility. Even the &s;eamen were affected with the general popularity of his name, and revolted to him with the greate&s;t part of a fleet that had been equipped to oppo&s;e his pa&s;&s;age. Henry, who outwardly pretended to &s;light
<PB N="188" REF="198">
all the&s;e preparations, yet had penetration enough to perceive, that his &s;ubjects fluctuated in their inclinations between him and his bro|ther. In this emergency, he had recour&s;e to the bigotry of the people, to oppo&s;e their &s;en|timents of ju&s;tice. He paid diligent court to An&s;elm, whole &s;anctity and wi&s;dom he pretend|ed to revere; and this prelate, in return, em|ployed all his credit in &s;ecuring him on the throne. He &s;crupled not to a&s;&s;ure the nobles of the king's &s;incerity in his profe&s;&s;ions of ju&s;tice; and even rode through the ranks of the army, recommending to the &s;oldiery the defence of their king, and promi&s;ing to &s;ee their valour rewarded. Thus the people were retain|ed in their allegiance to the u&s;urper, and the army marched chearfully forward to meet Robert and his forces, which were landed in &s;afe|ty at Port&s;mouth. When the two armies came in &s;ight, they both &s;eemed equally unwilling to hazard a battle; and their leaders, who &s;aw that much more would be lo&s;t than gained by &s;uch a conflict, made propo&s;als for an accom|modation. This, after the removal of a few ob&s;tacles, was agreed to; and it was &s;tipulat|ed, that Robert, upon the payment of a cer|tain &s;um, &s;hould re&s;ign his preten&s;ions to Eng|land; and that if either of the princes died
<PB N="189" REF="199">
without i&s;&s;ue, the other &s;hould &s;ucceed to his dominions. This treaty being ratified, the armies on each &s;ide were di&s;banded; and Ro|bert having lived two months in the utmo&s;t harmony with his brother, returned in peace to his own dominions.</P>
<P>But it was not in the power of formal trea|ties to bind up the re&s;entment of a monarch, who knew him&s;elf injured, and found it in his power to take revenge. Henry &s;oon &s;hewed his re&s;olution to puni&s;h all the heads of the party which had lately oppo&s;ed him; and this he did, under different pretexts, and by re|peated pro&s;ecutions. The earl of Shrew&s;bury, Arnulf de Montgomery, and Roger, earl of Lanca&s;ter, were bani&s;hed the kingdom, with the confi&s;cation of their e&s;tates. Robert de Pontefract, Robert de Mallet, William de Wa|rene, and the earl of Cornwall,<MILESTONE N="1103" UNIT="A.D."> were treated with equal &s;everity; &s;o that Robert, finding his friends thus oppre&s;&s;ed, came over to England to intercede in their behalf. Henry received him very coolly, a&s;&s;embled a council to deli|berate in what manner he &s;hould be treated; &s;o that Robert finding his own liberty to be in danger, was glad to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion to return; which, however, was not granted him, till he con&s;ented to give up his pen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="200">But the con&s;equences of Robert's indi&s;cre|tion were not confined to his own &s;afety alone; as he was totally aver&s;e to bu&s;ine&s;s, and only &s;tudious of the more &s;plendid amu&s;ements or employments of life, his affairs every day be|gan to wear a wor&s;e appearance. His &s;ervants pillaged him without compunction; and he is de&s;cribed as lying whole days a-bed for want of cloaths, of which they had robbed him. His &s;ubjects were treated &s;till more deplorably, for being under the command of petty and ra|pacious tyrants, who plundered them without mercy, the whole country was become a &s;cene of violence and depredation. It was in this mi&s;erable exigence, that the Normans at length had recour&s;e to Henry, from who&s;e wi&s;e admini&s;tration of his own dominions, they expected a &s;imilitude of pro&s;perity, &s;hould he take the reins of theirs. Henry very readily promi&s;ed to redre&s;s their grievances, as he knew it would be the direct method to &s;econd his own ambition.<MILESTONE N="1105" UNIT="A.D."> The year en&s;uing, there|fore, he landed in Normandy with a &s;trong army, took &s;ome of the principal towns; and &s;hewed, by the rapidity of his progre&s;s, that he meditated the entire conque&s;t of the country.</P>
<P>Robert, who had already mortgaged, or gi|ven away the greate&s;t part of his deme&s;ne, &s;pent
<PB N="191" REF="201">
his time in the mo&s;t indolent amu&s;ements, and looked upon the progre&s;s of Henry with an eye of perfect indifference. But being at la&s;t rou&s;ed from his lethargy, and finding his af|fairs in a de&s;perate &s;ituation; he took the &s;trange re&s;olution of appealing, in per&s;on, to Henry's natural affections, which this brave, imprudent man, e&s;timated by the emotions of his own heart. Henry received him, not only with coolne&s;s, but contempt; and &s;oon taught him, that no virtues will gain that man e&s;teem who has forfeited his preten&s;ions to prudence. Robert, thus treated with indignity, quitted his brother in a tran&s;port of rage, expre&s;&s;ing an ardent purpo&s;e of revenge; to which, Henry paid no &s;ort of regard.</P>
<P>Robert was re&s;olved, however, to &s;hew him|&s;elf formidable; even in the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of his circum&s;tances. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with high ideas of chivalry, which his expedition to the holy land &s;erved to heighten, he was willing to re|trieve his affairs by valour, which he had lo&s;t by indolence. Being &s;upported by the earl of Mortaigne and Robert de Bele&s;me, Henry's inveterate enemies, he rai&s;ed an army, and ap|proached his brother's camp, with a view of fini&s;hing, by a deci&s;ive battle, the quarrel be|tween them. While the two armies were yet
<PB N="192" REF="202">
in &s;ight of each other, &s;ome of the clergy em|ployed their mediation to bring on a treaty; but as Henry in&s;i&s;ted upon Robert's renoun|cing the government of his dominions entirely, and one half of the revenue, all accommoda|tion was rejected with di&s;dain, and both &s;ides prepared for battle. Robert was now entered on that &s;cene of action in which he chiefly glo|ried, and in which he was always known to excel. He animated his little army by his example, and led them to the encounter with that &s;pirit which had formerly made the infi|dels tremble. There was no with&s;tanding his fir&s;t &s;hock; that quarter of the Engli&s;h army where he made the impre&s;&s;ion gave way, and he was nearly on the point of gaining a com|plete victory. But it was different on that quarter where Bele&s;me commanded; he was put to &s;light by one of the king's generals, who al&s;o advancing him&s;elf with a fre&s;h body of hor&s;e to &s;u&s;tain his center, his whole army rallied; while Robert's forces, exhau&s;ted and broken, gave ground on every &s;ide, in &s;pite of all his efforts and acts of per&s;onal valour. But though he now &s;aw his army defeated, and thou&s;ands falling round him, yet he refu&s;ed to find &s;afety by flight, or turn his back upon an enemy that he &s;till di&s;dained. He was
<PB N="193" REF="203">
taken pri&s;oner, with near ten thou&s;and of his men, and all the con&s;iderable barons who had adhered to his misfortunes. This victory was followed by the final reduction of Normandy, while Henry returned in triumph to England, leading with him his captive brother, who, af|ter a life of bravery, genero&s;ity, and truth, now found him&s;elf not only deprived of his patrimony and his friends, but al&s;o of his freedom. Henry, unmindful of his bro|ther's former magnanimity with regard to him, detained him a pri&s;oner during the re|mainder of his life, which was no le&s;s than twenty-eight years; and he died in the ca&s;tle of Cardiff, in Glamorgan&s;hire. It is even &s;aid by &s;ome, that he was deprived of his &s;ight by a red-hot copper ba&s;on applied to his eyes; while his brother attempted to &s;tifle the re|proaches of his con&s;cience, by founding the abbey of Reading, which was then con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient atonement for every degree of barbarity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep Henry took, after his return to England, was to reform &s;ome abu&s;es which had crept in among his courtiers; for, as they were allowed by the feudal law to live upon the king's tenants whenever he travelled, they, un|der colour of this, committed all manner of ra|vages
<PB N="194" REF="204">
with impunity. To remedy this di&s;or|der, he publi&s;hed an edict, puni&s;hing with the lo&s;s of &s;ight all &s;uch as &s;hould, under pretext of royal authority, commit any depredations in the places through which they pa&s;&s;ed. Some di&s;putes al&s;o concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, which were &s;upported by An&s;elm, the archbi|&s;hop of Canterbury, were compromi&s;ed and ad|ju&s;ted. Henry was contented to re&s;ign his right of granting eccle&s;ia&s;tical inve&s;titures, but was allowed to receive homage from his bi|&s;hops for all their temporal properties and privi|leges. The marriage of prie&s;ts al&s;o was prohi|bited, and laymen were not allowed to marry within the &s;eventh degree of affinity. The laity were al&s;o prohibited from wearing long hair, a mode of dre&s;s to which the clergy &s;hew|ed the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e regulations &s;erved to give employ|ment to Henry in his peaceful intervals; but the apprehen&s;ions which he had from the di&s;|&s;atisfaction of his Norman &s;ubjects, and his fears for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, gave him but too much bu&s;ine&s;s to permit any long intervals of relaxa|tion. His principal concern was, to prevent his nephew, William, the &s;on of Robert, from &s;ucceeding to the crown, in prejudice of Wil|liam, his own &s;on, for whom he was &s;olicitous
<PB N="195" REF="205">
to &s;ecure it. His nephew was but &s;ix years of age, when he committed him to the care of Helie de St. Saen; and this nobleman di&s;charg|ed his tru&s;t in his education with a degree of fidelity uncommon at that barbarous period we are de&s;cribing. Finding that Henry was de&s;irous of recovering po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his pupil's per&s;on, he withdrew, and carried him to the court of Fulk, count of Anjou, who gave him protection. This noble youth, wandering from court to court, evaded all the arts of his power|ful uncle, who was not remi&s;s in trying every method of &s;eizing him, either by treaty or inti|midation. In this &s;truggle, Lewis, the king of France, took the young adventurer's part, and endeavoured to intere&s;t the pope in his quarrel. Failing in this, he endeavoured to gain, by force of arms, what his negociations could not obtain. A war en&s;ued between him and Hen|ry, in which many &s;light battles were fought, but attended with no deci&s;ive con&s;equences. In one of the&s;e, which was fought at Noyon, a city that Lewis had an intention to &s;urpri&s;e, the valour both of the nephew and the uncle, were not a little con&s;picuous. This young man, who inherited all his father's bravery, charged the van of the Engli&s;h army with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that it fell back upon the main body, com|manded
<PB N="196" REF="206">
by the king in per&s;on, who&s;e utmo&s;t efforts were unequal to the attack. Still, how|ever, exerting all his endeavours to &s;tem the torrent of the enemy that was pouring down upon him, a Norman knight, who&s;e name was William Cri&s;pin, di&s;charged at his head two &s;uch furious &s;trokes of a &s;abre, that his helmet was cut through, and his head &s;everely wound|ed. At the &s;ight of his own blood, which ru&s;hed down his vi&s;age, he was animated to a double exertion of his &s;trength, and retorted the blow with &s;uch force, that his antagoni&s;t was brought to the ground, and taken pri&s;oner. This decided the victory in favour of the Eng|li&s;h, who pur&s;ued the French with great &s;laugh|ter; and it al&s;o &s;erved to bring on an accom|modation &s;oon after, in which the intere&s;ts of his nephew were entirely neglected. From this period,<MILESTONE N="1119" UNIT="A.D."> till the time of that brave youth's death, which happened about eight years af|ter, he appears to have been employed in inef|fectual &s;truggles to gain tho&s;e dominions to which he had the mo&s;t ju&s;t hereditary claims, but wanted power to back his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Fortune now &s;eemed to &s;mile upon Henry, and promi&s;e a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of felicity. He was in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two powerful &s;tates, and had a &s;on who was acknowledged
<PB N="197" REF="207">
undi&s;puted heir, arrived at his eighteenth year, whom he loved mo&s;t tenderly. His daughter, Matilda, was al&s;o married to the emperor Hen|ry V. of Germany, and &s;he had been &s;ent to that court while yet but eight years old, for her education. All his pro&s;pects, however, were at once clouded by unfore&s;een misfor|tunes and accidents, which tinctured his re|maining years with mi&s;ery. The king, from the facility with which he u&s;urped the crown, dreading that his family might be &s;ubverted with the &s;ame ea&s;e, took care to have his &s;on recognized as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or by the &s;tates of England, and carried him over to Normandy to receive the homage of the barons of that duchy. After performing this requi&s;ite cere|mony, Henry returning triumphantly to Eng|land, brought with him a numerous retinue of the chief nobility, who &s;eemed to &s;hare in his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. In one of the ve&s;&s;els of the fleet, his &s;on, and &s;everal young noblemen, the com|panions of his plea&s;ures, went together to render the pa&s;&s;age more agreeable. The king &s;et &s;ail from Barfleur, and was &s;oon carried by a fair wind out of &s;ight of land. The prince was detained by &s;ome accident; and his &s;ailors, as well as their captain Fitz Stephen, having &s;pent the interval in drinking, became &s;o di&s;ordered, that they ran
<PB N="198" REF="208">
the &s;hip upon a rock, and immediately it was da&s;hed to pieces. The prince was put into the boat, and might have e&s;caped, had he not been called back by the cries of Maude, his natural &s;i&s;ter. He was at fir&s;t conveyed out of danger him&s;elf, but could not leave a per&s;on &s;o dear to peri&s;h without an effort to &s;ave her. He, therefore, prevailed upon the &s;ailors, to row back and take her in. The approach of the boat, giving &s;everal others who had been left upon the wreck, the hopes of &s;aving their lives, numbers leaped in, and the whole went to the bottom. Above an hundred and forty young noblemen of the prin|cipal families of England and Normandy, were lo&s;t on this occa&s;ion. A butcher of Rouen was the only per&s;on on board who e&s;caped; he clung to the ma&s;t, and was taken up the next morning by &s;ome fi&s;hermen. Fitz Stephen, the captain, while the butcher was thus buffetting the waves for his life, &s;wam up to him, and en|quired if the prince was yet living. When, being told, that he had peri&s;hed; then, I will not out-live him, &s;aid the captain, and immedi|ately &s;unk to the bottom. The &s;hrieks of the&s;e unfortunate people were heard from the &s;hore, and the noi&s;e even reached the king's &s;hip, but the cau&s;e was then unknown. Henry entertain|ed hopes for three days, that his &s;on had put
<PB N="199" REF="209">
into &s;ome di&s;tant port of England; but when certain intelligence of the calamity was brought him, he fainted away, and was never &s;een to &s;imile from that moment to the day of his death.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this prince's life &s;eems a mere blank, his re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ires having now nothing left worth toiling for, he appeared more fond of repo&s;e than ambition. His daughter, Matilda, however, becoming a widow by the death of the emperor, he married her a &s;econd time to Geoffry Plantagenet, elde&s;t &s;on of the count of Anjou, and, endeavoured to en&s;ure her acce&s;|&s;ion, by obliging his barons to recognize her as the heir of all his dominions. Some time after, that prince&s;s was delivered of a &s;on, who receiv|ed the name of Henry; and the king, farther to en&s;ure her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, cau&s;ed all the nobility of England and Normandy to renew their for|mer oaths of allegiance. The barons of the&s;e times were ready enough to &s;wear whatever the monarch commanded; but, it &s;eems, they ob|&s;erved it no longer than while they were com|pelled to obey. Henry did not long &s;urvive the&s;e endeavours to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his family. He was &s;eized with a &s;udden illne&s;s at St. Denis, a little town in Normandy, from eat|ing too plentifully of lampreys, a di&s;h he was particularly fond of. He died in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh
<PB N="200" REF="210">
year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign,<MILESTONE N="Dec. 1. 1135."> leaving, by will, his daughter Ma|tilda heire&s;s of all his dominions.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider Henry's character impartially, we &s;hall find more to admire than to love in it. It cannot be doubted, but that he was a wi&s;e and a valiant prince; and yet our hearts revolt again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;s, and follow the un|fortunate Robert even to his captivity. Hen|ry's per&s;on was manly, his countenance engag|ing, his eye clear, &s;erene, and penetrating. By his great progre&s;s in literature, he had acquired the name of Beau Clerc, or the &s;cholar; and &s;uch was the force of his eloquence, that, after a con|ference with him, the pope is &s;aid to have given him the preference to all the other princes of Europe. He was much addicted to women, and left behind him a numerous &s;purious off|&s;pring. Hunting, al&s;o, was one of his favou|rite amu&s;ements; and he is accu&s;ed of aug|menting the fore&s;ts which had been appropriat|ed during the former reigns for that diver&s;ion. His ju&s;tice al&s;o &s;eemed to approach cruelty; &s;tealing was fir&s;t made capital in his reign; and fal&s;e coining was puni&s;hed with death and mu|tilation. He fir&s;t granted the city of London a charter and privileges; and, from this fir&s;t con|ce&s;&s;ion, we may date the origin of Engli&s;h liber|ty, &s;uch as we find it at this day.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. VII. STEPHEN.</HEAD>
<P>AS every expedient was u&s;ed during the life of the late king, to fix the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his fa|mily, he, among others, thought that the ag|grandizing his neare&s;t relations would not be an impolitic &s;tep. He only dreaded the de&s;igns of Robert and his adherents, no way mi&s;tru&s;t|ing any attempts from another quarter. With the&s;e views, he was very liberal in heaping
<PB N="202" REF="212">
favours upon the children of his &s;i&s;ter Adela, who had been married to the count of Blois. He thought they would be the &s;tronge&s;t &s;afe|guard to protect him from the a&s;piring attempts of his brother, or his po&s;terity; and he was re&s;olv|ed to load them with favours, as being too far removed from the crown to entertain any hopes of &s;ucceeding in their de&s;igns to obtain it: in pur&s;uance of this plan, he had, &s;ome years before his death, invited Stephen and Henry, the two younge&s;t of his &s;i&s;ter's &s;ons, into England, and received them with great honour and e&s;teem. Thinking that he could never do too much to &s;e|cure their affections, he married Stephen to the daughter and heire&s;s of Eu&s;tace, count of Bou|logne, who brought him an immen&s;e fortune. He conferred on him the great e&s;tate forfeited by Robert Mallet in England, and by the earl of Montaigne in Normandy. Nor was Stephen's brother, Henry, without his &s;hare in the king's liberalities. He was created abbot of Gla&s;ton|bury, and bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; &s;o that the two brothers were thus become by far the mo&s;t powerful &s;ubjects in the kingdom.</P>
<P>Such great riches, &s;o much power, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of abilities, were the fir&s;t incen|tives to Stephen's ambition. Placed at no great di&s;tance from the throne by birth, and per|ceiving
<PB N="203" REF="213">
the &s;ucce&s;s of his uncle's u&s;urpation, he re&s;olved to run the &s;ame career, and &s;trike for the crown. For this purpo&s;e, even during the king's life-time, he u&s;ed all his arts to pro|cure popularity, and to cultivate the affections of the Engli&s;h nobility. By his bravery, acti|vity, and vigour, he acquired the e&s;teem of the barons; by his genero&s;ity and familiar addre&s;s he obtained the love of the people. No &s;ooner, therefore, was the king known to be dead, than Stephen, con&s;cious of his own power and in|fluence, re&s;olved to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he &s;o long de&s;ired. He immedi|ately ha&s;tened from Normandy, where he then was, and &s;etting &s;ail for England, landed at Do|ver. But there the citizens, apprized of his in|tent, &s;hut their gates again&s;t him. From thence he went on to Canterbury, where he was treat|ed with like di&s;re&s;pect; but, pa&s;&s;ing on, he ar|rived at London, where he was immediately &s;a|luted king, by all the lower ranks of the people. Being thus &s;ecured of the people, his next &s;tep was to gain over the clergy; and, for that pur|po&s;e, his brother, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, exerted all his influence among them, with good &s;ucce&s;s. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, as he had taken the oaths of allegiance to Matilda &s;eemed for a while to &s;tand out; but one Hugh Bigod,
<PB N="204" REF="214">
&s;teward of the hou&s;hold, averring upon oath that the late king had expre&s;&s;ed his intentions to make Stephen his heir, the archbi&s;hop anointed him without farther &s;cruple. Thus was Stephen made king, by one of tho&s;e &s;peedy revolutions which ever mark the barbarity of a &s;tate in which they are cu&s;tomary. The people acqui|e&s;ced in his claims from his popularity; the clergy allowed them, being influenced by the intrigues of his brother; and the nobility per|mitted a king, from the weakne&s;s of who&s;e title they might derive power to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t acts of an u&s;urper are always po|pular. Stephen, in order to &s;ecure his tottering throne, pa&s;&s;ed a charter, granting &s;everal privi|leges to the different orders of the &s;tate. To the nobility, a permi&s;&s;ion to hunt in their own fore&s;ts; to the clergy, a &s;peedy filling of all vacant benefices; and to the people, a re&s;tora|tion of the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. To fix him&s;elf &s;till more &s;ecurely, he took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the royal trea&s;ures at Winche&s;ter, and had his title ratified by the pope with a part of the money.</P>
<P>A crown thus gained by u&s;urpation, was to be kept only by repeated conce&s;&s;ions. The nobi|lity and the clergy, in proportion as they were in|dulged in one demand, only prepared to find out
<PB N="205" REF="215">
others. The barons, in return for their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, required the right of fortifying their ca&s;tles, and putting them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence; nor could the king refu&s;e his con&s;ent to &s;uch exorbitant demands, as their oppo&s;ition might be fatal. The clergy imitated the &s;ame pernicious example; and, in a &s;hort time, all England was filled with the&s;e independent fortre&s;&s;es, which the noble|men garri&s;oned with their own va&s;&s;als, or with mercenary bravos hired from the continent: nothing could exceed the mi&s;ery which the kingdom mu&s;t have been reduced to, at that terrible period of ari&s;tocracy. Unbounded ra|pine was exerci&s;ed upon the people for the maintenance of tho&s;e troops; the private ani|mo&s;ities of the nobility were productive of wars in every quarter; the erection of one ca&s;tle proved the immediate cau&s;e of building many more; and the whole country pre&s;ented a &s;cene of petty tyranny and ho&s;tile preparation. It was in vain that a victory,<MILESTONE N="1158" UNIT="A.D."> gained by the king over the Scots at Northallerton, promi&s;ed to allay the murmurs of the people: their mi&s;e|ries were ri&s;en to too great a height for &s;uch brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es to remove. The prince hav|ing u&s;urped the throne without a title, was obliged to tolerate in others that inju&s;tice by which he had him&s;elf ri&s;en to the throne.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="216">Yet not only real, but imaginary grievances were added, to rai&s;e the di&s;contents of the peo|ple, and fill the country with complaints again&s;t government. The clergy, who&s;e power had been firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruins of the regal authority, began, in imitation of the lay barons, to build ca&s;tles, and entertain garri&s;ons, &s;en&s;ible that their &s;acred preten&s;ions would be more implicitly obeyed, when their temporal power was &s;ufficient to enforce them. Stephen, who now too late perceived the mi&s;chiefs attending the&s;e multiplied citadels, re&s;olved to begin with de&s;troying tho&s;e of the clergy, who&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to be aver&s;e to the duties of war. Taking, therefore, the pretence of a fray which had ari&s;en between the retinue of the bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury and that of the earl of Brittany, he &s;eized that prelate, and obliged both him and the bi&s;hop of Lincoln to deliver up their ca&s;tles, which they had lately erected. This the whole body of the clergy con&s;idered as a breach of that charter which he had granted upon his acce&s;&s;ion; they loudly murmured again&s;t his infraction; and even the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, his brother, re&s;olved to vindicate the privileges of the church, which he pre|tended were openly violated. A &s;ynod was a&s;|&s;embled, in which the di&s;graced prelates openly
<PB N="207" REF="217">
inveighed again&s;t the king. But he in&s;tead of an&s;wering their charge in per&s;on, &s;ent one of his barons to plead his cau&s;e, and intimidate his accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>It was in this critical &s;ituation of Stephen's affairs, that accounts were brought him of Ma|tilda's landing in England, with a re&s;olu|tion to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him, and regain the crown. Matilda, upon the death of the late king, be|ing then in Normandy, found her&s;elf totally unable to oppo&s;e the rapid progre&s;s of her ri|val. She was not le&s;s unfortunate in her con|tinental connections than in tho&s;e at home. The Norman barons, unwilling to have the union with England di&s;&s;olved, almo&s;t unani|mou&s;ly declared for Stephen, and put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their government; while Geoffry him&s;elf, Matilda's hu&s;band, was content to re|&s;ign his preten&s;ions, and to receive a pen&s;ion from the Engli&s;h king. He had not, however, long acquie&s;ced in this compromi&s;e, when he was incited to a renewal of his wife's claims by Robert earl of Glouce&s;ter, natural &s;on of the late king, a nobleman who had, from the be|ginning, oppo&s;ed the acce&s;&s;ion of Stephen, and only waited a fit opportunity to begin an in|&s;urrection. This haughty baron, having at length &s;ettled with his friends the project of an
<PB N="208" REF="218">
oppo&s;ition, retired to the continent, to the court of Matilda, and from thence &s;ent the king a defiance, &s;olemnly renouncing his allegiance. It was not long before he was in a capacity ef|fectually to &s;econd his declarations; for, &s;en|&s;ible of the power of his party in England, he landed, together with Matilda, who&s;e claims he profe&s;&s;ed to &s;upport, upon the coa&s;t of Su&s;|&s;ex. The whole of Matilda's retinue, upon this occa&s;ion, amounted to no more than an hundred and forty knights, who immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Arundel ca&s;tle; but the na|ture of her claims &s;oon encrea&s;ed the number of her partizans, and her forces every day &s;eemed to gain ground upon tho&s;e of her anta|goni&s;t.<MILESTONE N="1139" UNIT="A.D."> Mean time Stephen, being a&s;&s;ured of her arrival, flew to be&s;iege Arundel, where &s;he had taken refuge, and where &s;he was protected by the queen dowager, who &s;ecretly favoured her preten&s;ions. This fortre&s;s was too feeble to promi&s;e a long defence; and it would have been &s;oon taken, had it not been repre&s;ented to the king, that, as it was a ca&s;tle belonging to the queen dowager, it would be an infringe|ment on the re&s;pect which was her due, to attempt taking it by force. There was a &s;pirit of genero&s;ity mixed with the rudene&s;s of the times, that un|accountably prevailed in many tran&s;actions;
<PB N="209" REF="219">
Stephen permitted Matilda to come forth in &s;afety, and had her conveyed with &s;ecurity to Bri&s;tol, another fortre&s;s equally &s;trong with that from whence he permitted her to retire. It would be tedious to relate the various &s;kir|mi&s;hes on either &s;ide, in pur&s;uance of their re|&s;pective preten&s;ions; it will &s;uffice to &s;ay, that Matilda's forces encrea&s;ed every day, while her antagoni&s;t &s;eemed every hour to become more unpopular. The troops Stephen led were, in general, foreign mercenaries, commanded by tu|multuous barons, more accu&s;tomed to pillage than to conquer. But, in this fluctuation of &s;ucce&s;s, the kingdom was expo&s;ed to ruin, which ever &s;ide pretended to victory. The ca&s;tles of the nobility were become receptacles for licen&s;ed robbers, who gave their rapine the name of attachment to party. The land was left untilled, the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry were de&s;troyed or abandoned, and a terrible famine, the re&s;ult of general di&s;order, oppre&s;&s;ed at once the &s;poiled and the &s;poilers.</P>
<P>After the mi&s;ery of numberle&s;s undeci&s;ive conflicts, added to the re&s;t of the country's ca|lamities, a complete victory, gained by the forces of Matilda, promi&s;ed to terminate their di&s;putes. Stephen had marched his forces to relieve the city of Lincoln; the earl of Glou|ce&s;ter
<PB N="210" REF="220">
led a body of troops to &s;econd the efforts of the be&s;iegers.<MILESTONE N="1141" UNIT="A.D."> The&s;e two armies engaged within &s;ight of the city, and a dreadful conflict en&s;ued. After a violent &s;hock, the two wings of Stephen's army, which were compo&s;ed of hor&s;e, were put to flight; and the infantry &s;oon following the example, de&s;erted their king. All the race of the Norman conqueror were brave. Stephen was for &s;ome time left with|out attendants, and fought on foot in the mid&s;t of his enemies, a&s;&s;aulted by multitudes, and re&s;i&s;ting all their efforts, with a&s;toni&s;hing intre|pidity. Being hemmed in on every &s;ide, he made way for &s;ome time with his battle-ax; but that breaking, he drew out his &s;word and dealt his blows round the circle in which he was en|clo&s;ed. At length, after performing more than could be naturally expected from a &s;ingle arm, his &s;word flying in pieces, he was obliged to &s;urrender him&s;elf a pri&s;oner. He was con|ducted to Glouce&s;ter; and though at fir&s;t treated with re&s;pect, he was &s;oon after, on &s;ome &s;u&s;picions, thrown into pri&s;on and laid in irons.</P>
<P>Stephen and his party now &s;eemed totally di&s;abled. Matilda was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only of &s;u|perior power, but al&s;o the ju&s;ter title. She was con&s;idered as inconte&s;tible &s;overeign, and the ba|rons
<PB N="211" REF="221">
came in daily from all quarters to do her ho|mage. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter him&s;elf, who had e&s;pou&s;ed her cau&s;e again&s;t his brother, admit|ted her claims; he led her in proce&s;&s;ion into his cathedral, and ble&s;&s;ed her with the greate&s;t &s;o|lemnity; the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury al&s;o &s;wore allegiance; and &s;hortly after an eccle&s;ia&s;|tical council, at which none of the laity a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed, except deputies from the city of London, confirmed her preten&s;ions; and &s;he was crown|ed at Winche&s;ter with all imaginable &s;olem|nity.</P>
<P>A crown thus every way &s;ecured,<MILESTONE N="1141" UNIT="A.D."> &s;eemed liable to be &s;haken by no accidents; yet &s;uch is the vanity of human &s;ecurity, and &s;uch was the great encrea&s;e of power among the barons, who were in effect ma&s;ters of tho&s;e they nomi|nally elected as governors, that Matilda re|mained but a &s;hort time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. This prince&s;s, be&s;ide the di&s;advan|tages of her &s;ex, which weakened her influence over a martial people, was re&s;olved upon re|pre&s;&s;ing the growing power of the nobles, who had left only the &s;hadow of authority to their &s;overeign. But having neither temper, nor policy &s;ufficient to carry her views into execu|tion, &s;he di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e by her pride, to whom &s;he was obliged for her power. The fir&s;t
<PB N="212" REF="222">
petition &s;he refu&s;ed, was the relea&s;ement of Stephen; &s;he rejected the remon&s;trance of the Londoners, who intreated her to mitigate the &s;evere laws of the Norman princes, and revive tho&s;e of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. She affected to treat the nobility with a degree of di&s;dain, to which they had long been unaccu&s;tomed; while the fickle nation once more began to pity their depo&s;ed king, and to repent the &s;teps they had taken in her favour. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, who probably was never her &s;in|cere partizan, was not remi&s;s in fomenting the&s;e di&s;contents; and when he found the people ripe for a tumult, detached a party of his friends and va&s;&s;als to block up the city of London, where the queen then re&s;ided. At the &s;ame time, mea&s;ures were taken to in&s;ti|gate the Londoners to a revolt, and to &s;eize her per&s;on. Matilda having timely notice of this con&s;piracy, fled to Winche&s;ter, whither the bi&s;hop, &s;till her &s;ecret enemy followed her, watching an opportunity to ruin her cau&s;e. His party was &s;oon &s;ufficiently &s;trong to bid the queen open defiance; and to be&s;iege her in the very place, where &s;he fir&s;t received his benediction. There &s;he continued for &s;ome time, but the town being pre&s;&s;ed by famine &s;he was obliged to e&s;cape, while her brother the
<PB N="213" REF="223">
earl of Glouce&s;ter endeavouring to follow, was taken pri&s;oner, and exchanged for Stephen, who &s;till continued a captive. Thus a &s;udden revolution once more took place; Matilda was depo&s;ed and obliged to &s;eek for &s;afety in Ox|ford. Stephen was again recognized as king, and taken from his dungeon to be placed on the throne!</P>
<P>The civil war now broke out afre&s;h, with all its train of deva&s;tations. Many were the battles fought, and various the &s;tratagems of tho&s;e who conducted the affairs of either party. Matilda e&s;caped from Oxford at a time when the fields were covered with &s;now, by being dre&s;&s;ed all in white, with four knights her at|tendants, habited in the &s;ame manner. Ste|phen was upon another occa&s;ion &s;urpri&s;ed by the earl of Glouce&s;ter at Wilton; and obliged to find &s;afety by flight. Another time the em|pre&s;s was obliged to quit the kingdom; and the death of the earl of Glouce&s;ter &s;oon after, who was the &s;oul of her party, gave a dreadful blow to her intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till the affairs of Stephen continued to fluctuate. Though this monarch had the good fortune to &s;ee his rival fly to the continent, and leave him entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom; though his brother was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t
<PB N="214" REF="224">
authority among the clergy, yet he was &s;till in&s;ecure. Finding that the ca&s;tles built by the noblemen of his own party encou|raged a &s;pirit of independence, and were lit|tle le&s;s dangerous than tho&s;e which remained in the hands of the enemy, he endeavoured to gain the&s;e; and this attempt united many of his own adherents again&s;t him. This di&s;con|tent was encrea&s;ed by the oppo&s;ition of the clergy, who, from having been on his &s;ide, be|gan to declare loudly in favour of his oppo|nents. The pope laid his whole party under an interdict, for his having refu&s;ed to &s;end deputies, to be named by him&s;elf, to the gene|ral council at Rheims. By this &s;entence, which was now fir&s;t practi&s;ed in England, di|vine &s;ervice was prohibited, and all the offices of religion cea&s;ed, except bapti&s;m and extreme unction. This &s;tate of Stephen's affairs looked &s;o unpromi&s;ing, that a revolution was once more expected, when his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;ee of Rome for a while &s;u&s;pended the threatened blow.</P>
<P>Stephen had hitherto been oppo&s;ed only by men who &s;econded the preten&s;ions of an|other; and who con&s;equently wanted that po|pularity, which tho&s;e have who fight their own cau&s;e. But he was now to enter the li&s;ts with a new oppo&s;er, who was every day com|ing
<PB N="215" REF="225">
to maturity, and growing more formida|ble. This was Henry the &s;on of Matilda,<MILESTONE N="1149" UNIT="A.D."> who had now reached his &s;ixteenth year; and gave the greate&s;t hopes of being one day a valiant leader and a con&s;ummate politician. It was u&s;ual in tho&s;e days for young noblemen to re|ceive the honour of knighthood before they were permitted to carry arms; and Henry pro|po&s;ed to receive his admi&s;&s;ion from his great uncle, David, king of Scotland. With this view, and in hopes of once more in&s;piring his mother's party, he landed in England with a great retinue of knights and &s;oldiers, accompanied by many noblemen, as well Engli&s;h as foreigners. The ceremony was performed by the Scotch king at Carli&s;le, amid&s;t a multitude of people a&s;&s;embled on this occa&s;ion, who all, plea&s;ed with the vigour, the addre&s;s, and &s;till more perhaps with the youth of the prince, &s;ecretly began to wi&s;h for a revo|lution in his favour. Soon after his return to Normandy, he was by his mother's con&s;ent, inve&s;ted with that duchy&punc; which had &s;ome time before revoked to her. He was al&s;o, upon the death of his father Geoffry Plantage|net, &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions; and to add &s;till more to his increa&s;ing power, he married Eleanor the daughter and heire&s;s
<PB N="216" REF="226">
of the duke of Guienne and Poitou; and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e exten&s;ive territories.</P>
<P>With this great acce&s;&s;ion of power, young Henry was now re&s;olved to reclaim his here|ditary kingdom; and to di&s;pute once more Stephen's u&s;urped preten&s;ions. For this pur|po&s;e, being previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured of the di&s;po&s;i|tions of the majority of the people in his favour, he made an inva&s;ion on England,<MILESTONE N="1153" UNIT="A.D."> where he was immediately joined by almo&s;t all the barons of the kingdom. Though it was now the middle of winter, he advanced to be&s;iege Malm&s;bury; and took the town, after having wor&s;ted a body of the enemy that attempted to oppo&s;e his march. Soon after Reading, and above thirty other fortre&s;&s;es, &s;ubmitted without re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean time Stephen, alarmed at the power and popularity of his young rival, tried every method to anticipate the purpo&s;e of his inva&s;ion, by depriving him of a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion he &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ought after. He had con|voked a council in London, where he pro|po&s;ed his own &s;on Eu&s;tace, who was but a weak prince, as his a&s;&s;ociate in government, as well as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He had even expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of immediately proceeding to the coro|nation; but was mortified to find, that the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury refu&s;ed to perform
<PB N="217" REF="227">
the ceremony. It was then no time to pro&s;e|cute his re&s;entment, when his rival was land|ed, and making ha&s;ty &s;trides to the throne; wherefore finding that Henry was advancing with a rapid progre&s;s, he marched with all po&s;&s;ible diligence to oppo&s;e him, where he was be&s;ieging Wallingford; and coming in fight, he re&s;ted his army to prepare for battle. In this &s;ituation the two-armies remained for &s;ome time, within a quarter of a mile of each other, a deci&s;ive action being every day expected. While they continued thus in anxious expecta|tion, a treaty was &s;et on foot by the interpo&s;i|tion of William, earl of Arundel, for termina|ting the di&s;pute without blood. The death of Stephen's &s;on, which happened during the cour&s;e of the treaty, facilitated its conclu&s;ion. It was therefore agreed by all parties, that Ste|phen &s;hould reign during life; and that ju&s;tice &s;hould be admini&s;tered in his name. That Henry &s;hould, on Stephen's death, &s;ucceed to the king|dom; and William, Stephen's &s;on, &s;hould in|herit Boulogne and his patrimonial e&s;tate. After all the barons had &s;worn to this treaty, which filled the whole kingdom with joy, Henry eva|cuated England; and Stephen returned to the peaceable enjoyment of his throne. His reign,<MILESTONE N="Oct. 25, 1154."> however, was &s;oon after terminated by his death,
<PB N="218" REF="228">
which happened about a year after the treaty, at Canterbury, where he was interred.</P>
<P>The fortune of many princes gives them, with po&s;terity, the reputation of wi&s;dom and virtue: Stephen wanted &s;ucce&s;s in all his &s;chemes but that of a&s;cending the throne; and con&s;equently his virtues and abilities now remain doubtful. If we e&s;timate them by the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects, they will appear in a very de&s;picable light; for England was never more mi&s;erable than during his reign: but if we con&s;ider them as they ap|pear in his private conduct, few monarchs can boa&s;t more. Active, generous, and brave, his &s;ole aim was to de&s;troy a vile ari&s;trocacy, that then oppre&s;&s;ed the people; but the abilities of no man, however politic or intrepid, were then &s;ufficient to re&s;i&s;t an evil, that was too firmly &s;upported by power. The faults therefore of this monarch's reign are entirely to be imput|ed to the ungovernable &s;pirit of the people, but his virtues were his own.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. VIII. HENRY II.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto &s;een the barons and clergy becoming powerful, in proportion to the weakne&s;s of the monarch's title to the crown, and enriching them&s;elves with the &s;poils of enfeebled maje&s;ty. Henry Plantagenet had now every right, both from hereditary &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, from univer&s;al a&s;&s;ent, from power, and per&s;onal merit, to make &s;ure of the throne,
<PB N="220" REF="230">
and to keep its prerogatives unimpaired. He was employed in be&s;ieging a ca&s;tle of one of his mutinous barons upon the continent, when news was brought him of Stephen's death; but, &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ecurity of his claims in England, he would not relinqui&s;h his enter|prize till he had reduced the place. He then &s;et out on his journey, and was received in England with the acclamations of all the peo|ple; who, harra&s;&s;ed with &s;upporting oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions, were now rejoiced to &s;ee all parties united.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act of Henry's government gave the people an happy omen of his future wi&s;e admini&s;tration. Con&s;cious of his &s;trength, he began to correct tho&s;e abu&s;es, and to re&s;ume tho&s;e privileges, which had been extorted from the weakne&s;s or the credulity of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors. He immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e mercenary &s;oldiers, who committed infinite di&s;orders in the nation. He ordered all the ca&s;tles, which were erected &s;ince the death of Henry the fir&s;t, and were become receptacles of rapine, to be demoli&s;hed, except a few, which he retained in his own hands for the protection of the kingdom. The adulterated coin was cried down, and new money &s;truck of the right value and &s;tandard. He re&s;umed many
<PB N="221" REF="231">
of tho&s;e benefactions which had been made to churches and mona&s;teries in the former reigns. He gave charters to &s;everal towns, by which the citizens claimed their freedom and privi|leges, independent of any &s;uperior but him|&s;elf. The&s;e charters were the groundwork of Engli&s;h liberty. The &s;truggles which had be|fore this time been, whether the king or the barons, or the clergy, &s;hould be de&s;potic over the people, now began to a&s;&s;ume a new a&s;pect; and a fourth order, namely, that of the more opulent of the people, began to claim a &s;hare in admini&s;tration. Thus was the feudal go|vernment at fir&s;t impaired; and liberty began to be more equally diffu&s;ed throughout the nation.</P>
<P>From this happy commencement, England once more began to re&s;pire; agriculture re|turned with &s;ecurity; and every individual &s;eemed to enjoy the happy effects of the young king's wi&s;e admini&s;tration. Not but that &s;ome &s;light commotions proceeded from many of the depre&s;&s;ed barons, who were quickly brought to a &s;en&s;e of their duty; as al&s;o from the Wel&s;h, who made &s;everal incur&s;ions; but the&s;e were at la&s;t obliged to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and to return to their natural fortre&s;&s;es. But to &s;uch a &s;tate of tranquillity was the whole king|dom
<PB N="222" REF="232">
brought in a very &s;hort time, that Henry thought his pre&s;ence no longer nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve order at home; and therefore made an expedition to the continent, where his affairs were in &s;ome di&s;order.</P>
<P>As the tran&s;actions of the continent do not pro|perly fall within the limits of this &s;canty page, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that Henry's valour and prudence &s;econding his ambition, he &s;oon ex|tended his power in that part of his domi|nions; and found him&s;elf, either by mar|riage, or hereditary claims, ma&s;ter of a third part of the French monarchy. He became ma&s;ter, in right of his father, of Anjou, Touraine, and Maine; in that of his mother, of Normandy; in that of his wife, of Gui|enne, Poictou, Xaintonge, Auvergne, Peri|gord, Angumois, and the Limou&s;in; to which he &s;hortly after added Brittany, by marrying his &s;on, who was yet a child, to the heire&s;s of that dukedom, who was yet a child al&s;o; and thus &s;ecuring that province, under pretence of being his &s;on's guardian. It was in vain that Lewis, the king of France, oppo&s;ed his grow|ing power; and &s;everal ineffectual engage|ments &s;erved to prove, that little was to be ac|quired by force. A ce&s;&s;ation of arms, there|fore, was at fir&s;t concluded between them;
<PB N="223" REF="233">
and &s;oon after a peace, which was brought about by the pope's mediation.</P>
<P>Henry being thus become the mo&s;t powerful prince of his age,<MILESTONE N="1161" UNIT="A.D."> the undi&s;puted monarch of England, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than a third of France, and having humbled the barons that would circum&s;cribe his power, he might natu|rally be expected to reign with very little oppo|&s;ition for the future. But it happened otherwi&s;e. He found the &s;evere&s;t mortifications from a quarter, where he lea&s;t expected re&s;i&s;tance. Though he had dimini&s;hed the power of the barons, he was &s;en&s;ible that the temporal in|fluence of the clergy was &s;till gaining ground; and was grown to &s;uch a pitch, as would &s;hortly annihilate the authority of the &s;overeign him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They now &s;eemed re&s;olved not only to be exempted from the ordinary taxes of the &s;tate, but to be &s;ecured from its puni&s;hments al&s;o. They had extorted an immunity from all but eccle&s;ia&s;tical penalties, during the la&s;t di&s;tracted reign; and they continued to main|tain that grant in the pre&s;ent. It may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a law which thus &s;creened their guilt, contributed to encrea&s;e it; and we accordingly find upon record, not le&s;s than an hundred murders committed by men in holy
<PB N="224" REF="234">
orders, in the &s;hort period &s;ince the king's acce&s;&s;ion, not one of which was puni&s;hed, not &s;o much as with degradation; while the bi&s;hops them&s;elves &s;eemed to glory in this hor|rid indulgence.</P>
<P>The mild character, and advanced age, of Theobald, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, toge|ther with his merits, in refu&s;ing to put the crown on the head of Eu&s;tace, the &s;on of Ste|phen, prevented Henry, during his life-time, from any attempts to repre&s;s the vices of his clergy; but after his death, he re&s;olved to ex|ert him&s;elf with more activity. For this purpo&s;e, and that he might be &s;ecure again&s;t any oppo&s;ition, he advanced to that dignity Thomas &agrave; Becket, on who&s;e compliance he &s;uppo&s;ed he could entirely depend.</P>
<P>The famous Thomas &agrave; Becket, the fir&s;t man of Engli&s;h extraction, who had, &s;ince the Norman conque&s;t, ri&s;en to any &s;hare of power, was the &s;on of a citizen of London. Having received his early education in the &s;chools of that metropolis, he re&s;ided &s;ome time at Pa|ris; and on his return became clerk in the &s;heriff's office. In that &s;tation he was recom|mended to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and behaved with &s;o much prudence, that he obtained from that prelate &s;ome beneficial dig|nities
<PB N="225" REF="235">
in the church. Thomas, however, was not contented with moderate preferment; and re&s;olved to fit him&s;elf for an higher &s;tation in life, by travelling into Italy, where he &s;tu|died the civil law at Bologna. On his return, he appeared to have made &s;o great a proficiency in knowledge, that he was promoted by his patron to the archdeaconry of Canterbury, an office of con&s;iderable tru&s;t and profit. On the acce&s;&s;ion of Henry to the throne, he was recommended to that monarch as worthy of greater preferment; and the king finding, on farther acquaintance, that his &s;pirit and abili|ties entitled him to the highe&s;t tru&s;ts, he &s;oon promoted him to the dignity of chancellor, one of the fir&s;t civil offices in the kingdom. Preferments were now heaped upon him with|out number. He was made provo&s;t of Be|verly, dean of Ha&s;tings, and con&s;table of the Tower. He was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ho|nours of Eye and Berkham; and, to com|plete his grandeur, he was entru&s;ted with the education of prince Henry, &s;on and heir to the king. His revenues were immen&s;e; his expences were incredible. He kept open ta|ble for per&s;ons of all ranks. The mo&s;t co&s;tly luxuries were provided for his entertainments. The pomp of his retinue, the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="226" REF="236">
of his furniture, and the munificence of his pre&s;ents corre&s;ponded with the greatne&s;s of his preferments. His apartments exhibited an odd mixture of the rudene&s;s of the times, and the &s;plendour of his &s;tation; they glit|tered with gold and &s;ilver-plate, and yet were covered with hay or clean &s;traw in winter, and with green bows or ru&s;hes in &s;ummer, for the ea&s;e of his gue&s;ts to recline on. A great num|ber of knights were retained in his &s;ervice, and the greate&s;t barons were fond of being received at his table; the king him&s;elf fre|quently conde&s;cended to partake of his enter|tainments. He employed two and fifty clerks in keeping accounts of the vacant prelacies, and his own eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments. When he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea, he was always attended with five &s;hips; and in an emba&s;&s;y to Paris, he appeared with a thou&s;and per&s;ons in his re|tinue, di&s;playing &s;uch wealth as amazed the &s;pectators. As he was but in deacons orders, he declined few of the amu&s;ements then in fa&s;hion. He diverted him&s;elf in hawking, hunting, che&s;s-playing, and tilting; at which he was &s;o expert, that even the mo&s;t approved knights dreaded his encounter. His fami|liarity with the king is a&s;certained, by a &s;tory told of their happening to meet a beggar-man,
<PB N="227" REF="237">
as they were riding together through London. Would it not be right, &s;ays the king, ca&s;ting his eyes upon a poor wretch that was &s;hiver|ing with cold, to cloath that man in this &s;e|vere &s;ea&s;on? Certainly, replied his chancel|lor; and you do right in con&s;idering his cala|mity. If &s;o then, cried the king, he &s;hall have a coat in&s;tantly; and without more de|lay, he began to pull off the chancellor's coat with violence. The chancellor defended him|&s;elf for &s;ome time; but after a &s;truggle, in which they had both like to have fallen to the ground, he gave up his coat, and the king gave it to the beggar, who, ignorant of the quality of his benefactors, was not a little &s;urprized with his good fortune. Thus great, and intimate, was Becket while yet but chancellor; but when, contrary to the advice of Matilda, he was promoted &s;till higher to the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, his whole conduct took a new turn. No &s;ooner was he fixed in this high &s;tation, which rendered him for life the &s;econd per&s;on in the kingdom, than he endeavoured to retrieve the character of &s;anctity, which his former levities might have appeared to oppo&s;e. Without con&s;ult|ing his ma&s;ter's plea&s;ure, he &s;ent him the &s;eals of his office as lord-chancellor, pretending
<PB N="228" REF="238">
that he was henceforth to be employed in mat|ters of a more &s;acred nature. Though he &s;till retained the pomp and &s;plendor of his re|tinue, he was in his own per&s;on the mo&s;t mor|tified man that could be &s;een. He wore &s;ack|cloth next his &s;kin. He changed it &s;o &s;el|dom, that it was filled with dirt and vermin. His u&s;ual diet was bread, his drink, water; which he rendered further unpalatable, by the mixture of un&s;avoury herbs. His back was mangled with the frequent di&s;cipline. He every day wa&s;hed on his knees the feet of thirteen beggars. Every one that made pro|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;anctity was admitted to his conver|&s;ation; and his a&s;pect wore the appearance of mortification and &s;ecret &s;orrow. To the&s;e mortifications he &s;acrificed all the comforts of life; and it would be unju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e but that he thought the&s;e mortifications really me|ritorious.</P>
<P>Henry now &s;aw, when it was too late, the ambitious &s;uperiority which Becker aimed at. His re&s;ignation of the chancellor's office &s;erved to rai&s;e his &s;u&s;picions, how much he was mi&s;|taken in the pliancy of Becket's di&s;po&s;ition; but he was &s;oon after convinced, when this churchman, now made archbi&s;hop, began to re|vive &s;ome antient claims to &s;everal church-lands,
<PB N="229" REF="239">
that had lain dormant ever &s;ince the Conque&s;t. Henry, indeed, prevailed upon him to de&s;i&s;t from one or two of the&s;e claims; but he found for the future that he was to expect, in the &s;eemingly ea&s;y Becket, a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and turbulent oppo&s;er to all his &s;chemes of hum|bling the clergy.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this unexpected oppo&s;ition, Henry was re&s;olved to try every expedient to rectify the errors that had crept in among the clergy, who, under a pretence of independ|ence upon &s;ecular power, were grown mo&s;t abominably licentious. During the preceding reign, a great number of idle and illiterate per&s;ons, in order to enjoy the indulgence of their vices, had entered into holy orders; for the bi&s;hops &s;eldom rejected any that pre&s;ented. The&s;e having no benefices, and belonging to no dioce&s;e, and con&s;equently &s;ubject to no juri&s;|diction, committed the mo&s;t flagrant enormi|ties with impunity. Among other inventions of the clergy to obtain money, that of &s;elling pardons was introduced, and had become a revenue to the prie&s;ts. The&s;e, and &s;uch like grievances, bore hard upon the peo|ple; who were at the &s;ame time taught, that their only remedy was implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. A prince of Henry's excellent penetration ea&s;ily
<PB N="230" REF="240">
pierced through the mi&s;t of ignorance in which the age was involved; and re&s;olved, by a bold &s;truggle, to free the laity from the&s;e cle|rical u&s;urpations. An opportunity &s;oon offered, that gave him a popular pretext for beginning his intended reformation. A man in holy or|ders had debauched the daughter of a gentle|man in Worce&s;ter&s;hire; and then murdered the father, to prevent the effects of his re&s;entment. The atrociou&s;ne&s;s of the crime produced a &s;pirit of indignation among the people; and the king in&s;i&s;ted that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;hould be tried by the civil magi&s;trate. This Becket oppo&s;ed, al|ledging the privileges of the church; and or|dered the criminal to be confined in the bi|&s;hops pri&s;on, le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;eized by the officers of the king. It was to no purpo&s;e that the king de&s;ired he might be tried fir&s;t by an eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, and then deli|vered up to the &s;ecular tribunal. Becket a&s;|&s;erted that it was unju&s;t to try a man twice for the &s;ame offence; and appealed for the equity of his opinions to the court of Rome. This, however, was the time for Henry to make his bolde&s;t attack upon the immu|nities of the church; when, to defend it&s;elf it mu&s;t al&s;o e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t atrocious of criminals. He therefore &s;um|moned
<PB N="231" REF="241">
an a&s;&s;embly of all the prelates in Eng|land, and de&s;ired that the murderer &s;hould be delivered over to the hands of ju&s;tice, and a law made to puni&s;h &s;uch delinquents for the future. Becket retired with the prelates to deliberate; but as he guided in the a&s;&s;embly, they entrenched them&s;elves behind the papal decrees, and they refu&s;ed to give up their pri|&s;oner. Henry, willing to bring them to an open ab&s;urdity, demanded, whether they were willing or not to &s;ubmit to the ancient laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdom? To this they replied with equal art, that they were willing, except where their own order was concerned. The king, provoked pa&s;t bearing by this eva|&s;ive an&s;wer, in&s;tantly quitted the a&s;&s;embly; and &s;ent Becket orders to &s;urrender the ho|nours and ca&s;tles which he continued to hold, in con&s;equence of having been chancellor. The&s;e being &s;urrendered, the prelate quitted London, without taking the lea&s;t notice of the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Labouring for &s;ome time under the uncer|tainty of the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, Becket was &s;oon after induced to give way, and to pro|mi&s;e his maje&s;ty, without re&s;erve, a &s;teady ob|&s;ervance of the ancient laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdom. This was the di&s;po&s;ition which
<PB N="232" REF="242">
the king wi&s;hed to retain him in; and he therefore &s;ummoned a general council of the nobility and prelates at Clarendon, to whom he &s;ubmitted this great and important affair, and de&s;ired their concurrence. The&s;e coun|cils &s;eem, at that time, convened rather to give authenticity to the king's decrees, than to enact laws that were to bind their po&s;terity. A number of regulations were there drawn up, which were afterwards well known under the title of the Con&s;titutions of Clarendon, and were then voted without oppo&s;ition. By the&s;e regulations it was enacted, that clergy|men accu&s;ed of any crime &s;hould be tried in the civil courts; that laymen &s;hould not be tried in the &s;piritual courts, except by legal and reputable witne&s;&s;es; that the king &s;hould ultimately judge in eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;piritual appeals; that the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops &s;hould be regarded as barons, and obliged to furni&s;h the public &s;upplies as u&s;ual with per&s;ons of their rank; that the goods forfeited by the king &s;hould not be protected in churches, or church-yards, by the clergy; and that the &s;ons of villains &s;hould not take orders without the con&s;ent of their lord. The&s;e, with &s;ome others of le&s;s con&s;equence, or implied in the above, to the number of &s;ixteen, were readily
<PB N="233" REF="243">
&s;ub&s;cribed by all the bi&s;hops pre&s;ent; and Becket him&s;elf, who at fir&s;t &s;hewed &s;ome re|luctance, added his name to the number. It only remained that the pope &s;hould ra|tify them; but there Henry was mi&s;taken. Alexander, who was then pope,<MILESTONE N="1164" UNIT="A.D."> condemned them in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, abrogated, an|nulled, and rejected them; out of &s;ixteen he admitted only &s;ix, which he thought not im|portant enough to de&s;erve cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>How Henry could &s;uppo&s;e the pope would give con&s;ent to the&s;e articles, which mu&s;t infallibly have de&s;troyed his whole authority in the king|dom, is not ea&s;y to conceive; but we may well &s;uppo&s;e, that a man of Becket's character mu&s;t be extremely mortified at finding that he had &s;igned what the pope had refu&s;ed to confirm. Accordingly, on this occa&s;ion, he expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;orrow for his former conce&s;&s;ions. He redoubled his au&s;terities, in order to puni&s;h him&s;elf for his criminal compliance; and re|fu&s;ed to perform at the altar, till he had ob|tained ab&s;olution from his holine&s;s. All the&s;e mortifications appeared to Henry as little more than &s;pecious in&s;ults upon him&s;elf; his former affection was converted into hatred, and the breach between him and the archbi|&s;hop every day grew wider. At la&s;t, willing
<PB N="234" REF="244">
to &s;uper&s;ede the prelate's authority at any rate, he de&s;ired that the pope would &s;end a legate into his dominions; who, from the nature of his commi&s;&s;ion might have a &s;uperior controul. This the pope readily granted; and a legate was appointed, but with a clau&s;e annexed to his commi&s;&s;ion, that he was to execute no|thing in prejudice of the archbi&s;hop. An authority thus clogged in that very part where it was de&s;ired to be unlimited, was no way agreeable to the king; and he &s;ent back the commi&s;&s;ion with great indignation. He now, therefore went another way to wreak his re&s;entment upon Becket. He had him &s;ued for &s;ome lands, which were part of a ma|nor belonging to his primacy; and the primate being detained by &s;ickne&s;s from coming into court, his non-attendance was con&s;trued into di&s;re&s;pect. A great council was &s;ummoned at Northampton, where Becket defended his cau&s;e in per&s;on; but he was condemned as guilty of a contempt of the king's court, and as wanting in that fealty which he had &s;worn to his &s;overeign. All his goods and chattels were confi&s;cated; and the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter was obliged to pronounce the &s;entence again&s;t him. Be&s;ides this conviction, the king exhi|bited another charge again&s;t him for three hun|dred
<PB N="235" REF="245">
pounds which he had levied on the honours of Eye and Barkham, while he remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Becket, rather than aggravate the king's re&s;entment, agreed to give &s;ureties for the payment. The next day, another &s;uit was commenced again&s;t him for a thou&s;and marks, which the king had lent him on &s;ome former occa&s;ion. Immediately on the back of the&s;e, a third claim was made, &s;till greater than the for|mer. This was to give an account of the money he had received, and expended, during the time of his chancellor&s;hip. The e&s;timate was laid at no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and marks; and Becket was wholly unprovided either of the means of balancing his accounts, or of &s;ecurities for an|&s;wering &s;o great a demand. In this exigence, his friends were divided what coun&s;el to give. Some prelates advi&s;ed him to re&s;ign his &s;ee, in hopes of an acquittal; &s;ome coun&s;elled him to throw him&s;elf entirely upon the king's mercy; and &s;ome to offer ten thou&s;and marks as a ge|neral &s;atisfaction for all demands. Becket fol|lowed none of the&s;e opinions; but with an intrepidity peculiar to him&s;elf, arraying him&s;elf in his epi&s;copal ve&s;tments, and with the cro&s;s in his hand, he went forward to the king's palace, and entering the royal apartments, &s;ate down, holding up the cro&s;s as his ban|ner
<PB N="236" REF="246">
of protection. The king, who &s;ate in an inner room, ordered by proclamation the pre|lates and the nobility to attend him; to whom he complained loudly of Becket's in&s;olence and in|flammatory proceedings. The whole council join|ed in condemning this in&s;tance of his unaccount|able pride; and determined to expo&s;tulate with him upon his incon&s;i&s;tency, in formerly &s;ub&s;crib|ing the Con&s;titutions of Clarendon, and now in being the fir&s;t to infringe them. But all their me&s;|&s;ages, threats, and arguments were to no pur|po&s;e; Becket had taken his re&s;olution, and it was now too late to attempt to &s;hake it. He put him&s;elf, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, under the protection of the &s;upreme pontiff; and appealed to him again&s;t any penalty which his iniquitous judges might think proper to in|flict. Then, departing the palace, he a&s;ked the king's immediate permi&s;&s;ion to leave Northampton; and upon receiving a refufal, he &s;ecretly withdrew in di&s;gui&s;e, and at la&s;t found means to cro&s;s over to the continent.</P>
<P>Here it may be natural to enquire, how a per&s;on of &s;uch mean extraction &s;hould be able to form any kind of oppo&s;ition to &s;o powerful a monarch as Henry? But the &s;tate was then, as it was for &s;ome ages after, compo&s;ed of three di&s;tinct powers,
<PB N="237" REF="247">
all pur&s;uing &s;eparate intere&s;ts, and very little dependent upon each other. The&s;e were, that of the king, that of the barons, and that of the clergy; for as yet the people had &s;carce any influence, &s;eparately con&s;idered. Of the&s;e three powers, the mo&s;t recent was that of the clergy; which, wanting the &s;anction of pre&s;criptive right, endeavoured to make up tho&s;e defects by their &s;uperior arts of popularity. They therefore attached the people, who had hitherto been con&s;idered as unworthy of notice in the con&s;titution, to their party; and thus gained an acqui&s;ition of &s;trength, that was often too powerful for the other two members of the &s;tate. The king being but a &s;ingle per&s;on, could have no wide connections among the lower orders of mankind; the nobles being bred up in an haughty independence, were taught to regard the inferior ranks as &s;laves; the clergy alone, by their duty, being obliged to conver&s;e with the lowe&s;t as well as the highe&s;t orders, were mo&s;t loved by the populace; who, &s;ince they were at any rate to be &s;laves, were the more willing to obey men who conver&s;ed with them, and who &s;eemed to &s;tudy their welfare, than &s;uch as kept them at an humiliating di&s;tance, and only regarded them as the in&s;truments of their
<PB N="238" REF="248">
private ambition. For the&s;e rea&s;ons therefore, during the times we &s;peak of, the &s;ide of the clergy was always e&s;pou&s;ed by the people; and Becket, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, &s;ecretly relied on their encouragement and &s;upport.</P>
<P>The intrepidity of Becket, joined to his ap|parent &s;anctity, gained him a very favourable reception upon the continent, both from the people and their governors. The king of France, who hated Henry, very much affected to pity his condition; and the pope, who&s;e cau&s;e he had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly defended, honoured him with the greate&s;t marks of di&s;tinction, while he treated Henry's amba&s;&s;adors with coolne&s;s and contempt. Becket, &s;en&s;ible of his power, was willing to &s;hew all po&s;&s;ible hu|mility; and even re&s;igned his &s;ee of Canter|bury into the pope's hands, in order to receive it back from him with greater &s;olemnity; and with an inve&s;titure of more apparent &s;anctity. Such favours be&s;towed upon an exile, and a perjured traitor, for &s;uch had been his &s;en|tence of condemnation in England, excited the indignation of Henry beyond mea&s;ure. He &s;aw his amba&s;&s;adors &s;lighted, all his endeavours to procure a conference with the pope fru&s;trat|ed, and his &s;ubjects daily excited to di&s;con|tents, in con&s;equence of the king's &s;everity to a
<PB N="239" REF="249">
&s;anctified character. In this &s;tate of re&s;entment, Henry re&s;olved to throw off all dependence upon the pontiff at once; and to free him&s;elf, and his people, from a burthen that had long oppre&s;&s;ed them without pity. He according|ly i&s;&s;ued orders to his ju&s;ticiaries, inhibiting, under &s;evere penalties, all appeals to the pope or the archbi&s;hop; and forbidding any of them to receive mandates from them, or to apply to their authority. He declared it trea&s;onable, to bring over from either of them any interdict upon the kingdom. This he made puni&s;hable in &s;ecular clergymen by the lo&s;s of their and by ca&s;tration, in regulars by the ampu|tation of their feet, and in laymen by death.</P>
<P>The pope and the archbi&s;hop were not re|mi&s;s on their &s;ide to retort the&s;e fulminations, and to &s;hake the very foundation of the king's authority. Becket compared him&s;elf to Chri&s;t, who had been condemned by a lay tribunal; and who was crucified a-new in the pre&s;ent op|pre&s;&s;ions under which the church laboured.</P>
<P>But he did not re&s;t in complaints only. He i&s;&s;ued out a cen&s;ure, excommunicating the king's chief mini&s;ters by name, all that were concerned in &s;eque&s;tring the revenues of his &s;ee, and all who obeyed or &s;avoured the Con|&s;titutions of Clarendon. He even threatened
<PB N="240" REF="250">
to excommunicate the king him&s;elf, if he did not immediately repent; and to give his cen|&s;ures the greater energy, he got them to be ra|tified by the pope.</P>
<P>Whatever Henry's contempt of the&s;e ful|minations might be in the beginning, he, af|ter &s;ome deliberation, began to find them more formidable than he had &s;uppo&s;ed, and &s;ecretly wi&s;hed for an accommodation. Yet there &s;eemed no other way for terminating the&s;e di&s;|putes, but by the king's appealing to the pope, as umpire between him and the arch|bi&s;hop, and this promi&s;ed no very favourable deci&s;ion. However, perceiving that his au|thority was beginning to decline among his &s;ubjects, and that his rivals on the continent had actually availed them&s;elves of his perplex|ities, he re&s;olved at any rate to apply to the pope for his mediation.<MILESTONE N="1167" UNIT="A.D."> The pope, on the other hand, was every day threatened him&s;elf by the machinations of an antipope. He was apprehen&s;ive that the king of England might join again&s;t him; he knew his great abilities, and was &s;en&s;ible that as yet no in&s;urrection had been made in con&s;equence of the threats and exhorta|tions of Becket. Thus the di&s;po&s;ition of both par|ties produced frequent attempts towards an ac|commodaion; but the mutual jealou&s;ies that each
bore
<PB N="241" REF="251">
of the other, and their anxiety not to lo&s;e the lea&s;t advantage in the negotiation, often pro|tracted this de&s;irable treaty. At one time the terms being agreed on, were po&s;tponed by the king's refu&s;ing to &s;ign; but with a &s;alvo to his royal dignity. At another time they were accommodated, but broke off by Becket's re|fu&s;ing to &s;ubmit; but with a &s;alvo to the ho|nour of God. A third and a fourth negotia|tion &s;ucceeded without effect. In this la&s;t, all the terms were completely adju&s;ted, when Becket took it into his head to demand a ki&s;s of peace. This the king refu&s;ed to grant; and both parties once more prepared for mu|tual annoyance.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;turbances continued for &s;ome time longer; Becket never lo&s;ing an opportunity of impeaching the king's mini&s;ters, and ob&s;truct|ing all his mea&s;ures. At length, however, by the mediation of the pope's legate, all diffi|culties were adju&s;ted; and while the king al|lowed Becket to return, that prelate con&s;ented to wave the ki&s;s of peace. The ceremonial of the interview being regulated, when the arch|bi&s;hop approached, the king advanced to meet him in the mo&s;t gracious manner; and conver&s;ed with him for &s;ome time, with great ea&s;e, familiarity, and kindne&s;s. All material
<PB N="242" REF="252">
points being adju&s;ted, Becket attended Henry on hor&s;eback; and as they rode together, the prelate begged &s;ome &s;atisfaction for the inva|&s;ions of his right by the archbi&s;hop of York, who had &s;ome time before crowned the young prince. To this Henry replied, that what was pa&s;t could not be undone; but that he would take care that none but he &s;hould crown the young queen, which ceremony was &s;oon to be performed. Becket, tran&s;ported at this in&s;tance of the king's conde&s;cen&s;ion, alighted in&s;tantly, and threw him&s;elf at the feet of his &s;overeign, who, leaping from his hor&s;e at the &s;ame time, lifted him from the ground, and helped him to remount. The terms of their pre|&s;ent agreement were very advantageous to the prelate; and this might have in&s;pired him in the ardour of his gratitude to &s;uch an humiliation. It was agreed, that he &s;hould not give up any of the rights of the church, or re&s;ign any of tho&s;e preten&s;ions, which had been the original ground of the quarrel; that Becket and his ad|herents &s;hould be re&s;tored to their livings; and that all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;uch benefices be|longing to the &s;ee of Canterbury, as had been in&s;talled &s;ince the primate's ab&s;ence, &s;hould be expelled, and Becket have liberty to &s;upply the vacancies. In return for the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="243" REF="253">
the king only reaped the advantage of &s;eeing his mini&s;ters ab&s;olved from the &s;entence of ex|communication, and of preventing an inter|dict, which was preparing to be laid upon all his dominions.</P>
<P>Becket having thus, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, tri|umphed over the king, was re&s;olved to remit nothing of the power which he had acquired. He &s;oon began to &s;hew, that not even a tem|porary tranquillity was to be the re&s;ult of his reconciliation. Nothing could exceed the in|&s;olence with which he conducted him&s;elf upon his fir&s;t landing in England. In&s;tead of re|tiring quietly to his dioce&s;e, with that mode&s;ty which became a man ju&s;t pardoned by his king, he made a progre&s;s through Kent, in all the &s;plendor and magnificence of a &s;ove|reign pontiff. As he approached Southwark, the clergy, the laity, men of all ranks and ages, came forth to meet him, and celebrated his triumphal entry with hymns of joy. Thus, confident of the voice and the hearts of the people, he began to launch forth his thunders again&s;t tho&s;e who had been his former oppo|&s;ers. The archbi&s;hop of York, who had crowned Henry's elde&s;t &s;on in his ab&s;ence, was the fir&s;t again&s;t whom he denounced &s;entence of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. The bi&s;hops of London and
<PB N="244" REF="254">
Sali&s;bury he actually excommunicated. Ro|bert de Broc, and Nigel de Sackville, were expo&s;ed to the &s;ame cen&s;ures; and many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable prelates and mini&s;ters, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the late coronation of the young prince, were partakers in the common calamity. One man he excommunicated for having &s;poken again&s;t him; and another, for having cut off the tail of one of his hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Henry was then in Normandy, while the primate was thus triumphantly parading thro' the kingdom; and it was not without the ut|mo&s;t indignation that he received information of his turbulent in&s;olence. When the &s;u&s;|pended and excommunicated prelates arrived with their complaints, his anger knew no bounds. He broke forth into the mo&s;t acrimo|nious expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t that arrogant church|man, whom he had rai&s;ed from the lowe&s;t &s;tation, to be the plague of his life, and the continual di&s;turber of his government. The archbi&s;hop of York remarked to him, that &s;o long as Becket lived, he could never expect to enjoy peace or tranquillity; and the king him&s;elf bur&s;t out into an exclamation, that he had no friends about him, or he would not &s;o long have been expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of that ungrateful hypocrite. The&s;e words excited
<PB N="245" REF="255">
the attention of the whole court; and armed four of his mo&s;t re&s;olute attendants to gratify their monarch's &s;ecret inclinations. The names of the&s;e knights and gentlemen of his hou&s;hold, were Reginal Fitz-Ur&s;e, William de Tracy, Hugh de Moreville, and Richard Brito, who immediately communicated their thoughts to each other. They in&s;tantly bound them&s;elves by an oath to revenge their king's quarrel; and &s;ecretly retiring from court, took &s;hipping at different ports, and met the next day at the ca&s;tle of Saltwode, within &s;ix miles of Can|terbury. Some menacing expre&s;&s;ions which they had dropt, and their &s;udden departure, gave the king rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their de&s;ign. He therefore &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to overtake and forbid them, in his name, to commit any vio|lence; but the&s;e orders arrived too late to pre|vent their fatal purpo&s;e. The con&s;pirators being joined by &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tants at the place of their meeting, proceeded to Canterbury with all that ha&s;te their bloody intentions required. Advancing directly to Becket's hou&s;e, and en|tering his apartment, they reproached him very fiercely for the ra&s;hne&s;s and the in&s;olence of his conduct; as if they had been willing to enjoy his terrors before they de&s;troyed him. Becket, however, was not in the lea&s;t terri|fied;
<PB N="246" REF="256">
but vindicated his actions with that zeal and re&s;olution, which nothing probably but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his innocence could in|&s;pire. The con&s;pirators felt the force of his replies; and were particularly enraged at a charge of ingratitude, which he objected to three of them, who had been formerly retained in his &s;ervice. During this altercation, the time approached for Becket to a&s;&s;i&s;t at ve&s;pers, whither he went unguarded, the con&s;pirators following, and preparing for their attempt. As &s;oon as he had reached the altar, where it is ju&s;t to think he a&s;pired at the glory of mar|tyrdom, they all fell upon him; and having cloven his head with repeated blows, he dropt down dead before the altar of St. Benedict, which was be&s;meared with his blood and brains.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the murder, the place where it was perpetrated, and the fortitude with which the prelate re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate, made a mo&s;t &s;urprizing impre&s;&s;ion on the people. No &s;ooner was his death known, than they ru&s;hed into the church to &s;ee the body; and dipping their hands in his blood, cro&s;&s;ed them&s;elves with it, as with that of a &s;aint. The clergy, who&s;e intere&s;t it was to have Becket con&s;idered as a &s;aint, and per|haps
<PB N="247" REF="257">
who were real in their belief, con&s;idering the times we treat of, did all that lay in their power to magnify his &s;anctity, to extol the merits of his martyrdom, and to hold him out as the fitte&s;t object of the veneration of the people. Their endeavours &s;oon prevailed. In|numerable were the miracles &s;aid to be wrought at his tomb; for when the people are brought to &s;ee a miracle, they generally find or make one. It was not &s;ufficient that his &s;hrine had the power of re&s;toring dead men to life; it re&s;tored al&s;o cows, dogs, and hor&s;es. It was reported, and believed, that he ro&s;e from his coffin before he was buried, to light the tapers de&s;igned for his funeral: nor was he remi&s;s, when the funeral ceremony was over, in &s;tretching forth his hands to give his bene|diction to the people. Thus Becket became a &s;aint; and the king was &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of procuring his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the king's con&s;terna|tion upon receiving the fir&s;t news of this pre|late's cata&s;trophe. He was in&s;tantly &s;en&s;ible that the murder would be ultimately imputed to him. He was apprized that his death would effect what his oppo&s;ition could not do; and would procure tho&s;e advantages to the church, which it had been the &s;tudy of his whole reign
<PB N="248" REF="258">
to refu&s;e. The&s;e con&s;iderations gave him the mo&s;t unfeigned concern. He &s;hut him&s;elf up in darkne&s;s, refu&s;ing even the attendance of his dome&s;tics. He even refu&s;ed, during three days, all nouri&s;hment. The courtiers dread|ing the effects of his regret, were at la&s;t obliged to break into his &s;olitude; and induced him at la&s;t to be reconciled to a mea&s;ure that he could not redre&s;s. The pope &s;oon after be|ing made &s;en&s;ible of the king's innocence, granted him his pardon; but upon condition that he would make every future &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and perform every injunction that the holy &s;ee &s;hould require. All things being thus ad|ju&s;ted, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who had murdered Becket, retired in &s;afety to the enjoyment of their former dignities and honours; and the king, in order to divert the minds of the people to a different object, undertook an expedition again&s;t Ireland.</P>
<P>Ireland was at that time in pretty much the &s;ame &s;ituation that England had been, after the fir&s;t inva&s;ion of the Saxons. They had been early converted to Chri&s;tianity; and, for three or four centuries after, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very large proportion of the learning of the times; being undi&s;turbed by foreign inva&s;ions, and perhaps too poor to invite the rapacity of con|querors,
<PB N="249" REF="259">
they enjoyed a peaceful life, which they gave up to piety, and &s;uch learning as was then thought nece&s;&s;ary to promote it. Of their learning, their arts, their piety, and even their poli&s;hed manners, too many monuments remain to this day for us to make the lea&s;t doubt concerning them; but it is equally true, that in time they fell from the&s;e advantages; and their degenerate po&s;terity, at the time we are now &s;peaking of, were wrapt in the darke&s;t barbarity. This may be imputed to the fre|quent inva&s;ions which they &s;uffered from the Danes, who over-ran the whole country, and every where &s;pread their ravages, and con|firmed their authority. The natives, kept in the &s;tricte&s;t bondage, grew every day more ignorant and brutal; and when at la&s;t they ro&s;e upon their conquerors, and totally expelled them the i&s;land, they wanted in&s;tructors to re|&s;tore them to their former attainments. From thence they continued in the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate of barbari&s;m. The towns that had been formerly built were &s;uffered to fall into ruin; the inhabitants exerci&s;ed pa&s;ture in the open country, and &s;ought protection from danger by retiring into their fore&s;ts and bogs. Al|mo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of religion was extingui&s;hed; the petty princes exerci&s;ed continual outrages
<PB N="250" REF="260">
upon each others territories; and nothing but &s;trength alone was able to procure redre&s;s.</P>
<P>At the time when Henry fir&s;t planned the inva&s;ion of the i&s;land, it was divided into five principalities, namely, Lein&s;ter, Meath, Mun|&s;ter, Ul&s;ter, and Connaught; each governed by its re&s;pective monarch. As it had been u&s;ual for one or other of tho&s;e to take the lead in their wars, he was denominated &s;ole monarch of the kingdom, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a power re|&s;embling that of the early Saxon monarchs in England. Roderic O Connor, king of Con|naught, was then advanced to this dignity, and Dermot M' Morrogh was king of Lein&s;ter. This la&s;t named prince, a weak licentious tyrant, had carried off and ravi&s;hed the daughter of the king of Meath, who being &s;trengthened by the alliance of the king of Connaught, invaded the ravi&s;her's dominions and expelled him from his kingdom. This prince, thus ju&s;tly puni&s;h|ed, had recour&s;e to Henry, who was at that time at Guienne; and offered to hold his king|dom of the Engli&s;h crown, in ca&s;e he recovered it by the king's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Henry readily ac|cepted the offer; but being at that time embarra&s;&s;ed by more near intere&s;ts, he only gave Dermot letters patent, by which he em|powered all his &s;ubjects to aid the Iri&s;h prince
<PB N="251" REF="261">
in the recovery of his dominions. Dermot, re|lying on this authority, returned to Bri&s;tol, where, after &s;ome difficulty he formed a treaty with Richard, &s;ur-named Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, who agreed to re-in&s;tate him in his dominions, upon condition of his being married to his daughter Eva, and declared heir of all his territory. He at the &s;ame time con|tracted for &s;uccours with Robert Fitz&s;tephen, and Maurice Fitzgerald, whom he promi&s;ed to gratify with the city of Wexford, and the two adjoining di&s;tricts which were then in po&s;|&s;e&s;ion of the Ea&s;terlings. Being thus a&s;&s;ured of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he returned privately to Ireland, and concealed him&s;elf during the winter in the mona&s;tery of Ferns, which he had founded. Robert Fitz&s;tephens was fir&s;t able,<MILESTONE N="1172" UNIT="A.D."> the en&s;uing &s;pring, to fulfil his engagements, by landing with an hundred and thirty knights, &s;ixty e&s;|quires, and three hundred archers. They were &s;oon after joined by Maurice Penderga&s;t, who, about the &s;ame time, brought over ten knights and &s;ixty archers; and with this &s;mall body of forces they re&s;olved on be&s;ieging Wexford, which was to be theirs by treaty. This town was quickly reduced; and the adventu|rers being reinforced by another body of men to the amount of an hundred and fifty,
<PB N="252" REF="262">
under the command of Maurice Fitzgerald, compo&s;ed an army that &s;truck the barbarous natives with awe. Roderic the chief monarch of the i&s;land, ventured to oppo&s;e them, but he was defeated; and &s;oon after the prince of O&s;&s;ory was obliged to &s;ubmit, and give ho&s;t|ages for his future conduct.</P>
<P>Dermot being thus re-in&s;tated in his here|ditary dominions, &s;oon began to conceive hopes of extending the limits of his power, and making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Ireland. With the&s;e views, he endeavoured to expedite Strong|bow; who, being per&s;onally prohibited by the king, was not yet come over. Dermot tried to enflame his ambition by the glory of the conque&s;t, and his avarice by the advantages it would procure, he expatiated on the cowardice of the natives, and the certainty of his &s;ucce&s;s. Strongbow fir&s;t &s;ent over Raymond, one of his retinue, with ten knights and &s;eventy arch|ers; and receiving permi&s;&s;ion &s;hortly after for him&s;elf, he landed with two hundred hor&s;e and an hundred archers. All the&s;e Engli&s;h forces, now joining together became irre&s;i&s;t|ible; and though the whole number did not amount to a thou&s;and, yet, &s;uch was the bar|barous &s;tate of the natives, that they were every where put to the rout. The city of
<PB N="253" REF="263">
Waterford quickly &s;urrendered; Dublin was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and Strongbow, &s;oon after marrying Eva according to treaty, became ma&s;ter of the kingdom of Lein&s;ter upon Der|mot's decea&s;e.</P>
<P>The i&s;land being thus in a manner wholly &s;ubdued, for nothing was capable of op|po&s;ing the further progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms, Henry became jealous of their &s;ucce&s;s, and was willing to &s;hare in per&s;on tho&s;e honours, which the adventurers had already &s;ecured. He therefore &s;hortly after, landed in Ireland at the head of five hundred knights and &s;ome &s;oldiers; not &s;o much to conquer a di&s;puted territory, as to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject king|dom. In his progre&s;s through the country, he received the homage of the petty chieftains as he went along, and left mo&s;t of them in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient territories. In a place &s;o uncultivated, and &s;o ill peopled, there was &s;till land enough to &s;atisfy the adventurers who had followed him. Strongbow was made &s;ene&s;|chal of Ireland, Hugh de Lacy was made go|vernor of Dublin, and John de Courcy receiv|ed a patent for conquering the province of Ul&s;ter, which had as yet remained un&s;ubdued. The Iri&s;h bi&s;hops very gladly admitted the Engli&s;h, as they expected from their &s;uperior
<PB N="254" REF="264">
civilization, a greater degree of reverence and re&s;pect. Pope Adrian, who had, in the beginning, encouraged Henry to &s;ubdue the Iri&s;h, by his bull, granting him the kingdom, now confirmed him in his conque&s;t, and the kings of England were acknowledged as lords over Ireland for ever. Thus, after a trifling effort, in which very little money was expend|ed, and little blood &s;hed, that beautiful i&s;land became an appendage to the Engli&s;h crown, and as &s;uch it has ever &s;ince continued, with un&s;haken fidelity.</P>
<P>The joy which this conque&s;t diffu&s;ed was very great; and Henry &s;eemed now to have attain|ed the &s;ummit of his utmo&s;t wi&s;hes. He was now undi&s;puted monarch of the greate&s;t do|main in Europe; father of a numerous pro|geny, that gave both lu&s;tre and authority to his crown; victorious over all his enemies, and chearfully obeyed by all his &s;ubjects. Henry, his elde&s;t &s;on, had been anointed king, and was ac|knowledged as undoubted &s;ucce&s;&s;or; Richard, his &s;econd &s;on, was inve&s;ted with the duchy of Guienne and Poitou; Geoffry, his third &s;on, in|herited, in right of his wife, the duchy of Brit|tany; and John, his younge&s;t, was de&s;igned as king in Ireland. Such was the flattering pro&s;pect of grandeur before him; but &s;uch is
<PB N="255" REF="265">
the in&s;tability of human happine&s;s, that this very exaltation of his family, proved the means of embittering his future life, and di&s;turbing his government.</P>
<P>Among the few vices a&s;cribed to this mo|narch, unlimited gallantry was one. Queen Eleanor, whom he had married from motives of ambition, and who had been divorced from her former royal con&s;ort for her incontinence, was long become di&s;agreeable to Henry; and he &s;ought in others, tho&s;e &s;atisfactions he could not find with her. Among the number of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es we have the name of Fair Ro&s;a|mond, who&s;e per&s;onal charms, and who&s;e death, make &s;o con&s;picuous a figure in the romances and the ballads of the time. It is true, that the &s;everity of critici&s;m has rejected mo&s;t of the&s;e accounts as fabulous; but even well-known fables, when much celebrated, make a part of the hi&s;tory, at lea&s;t of the man|ners of the age. Ro&s;amond Clifford is &s;aid to have been the mo&s;t beautiful woman that was ever &s;een in England, if what ro|mances and poets a&s;&s;ert be true. Henry loved her with a long and faithful attachment; and in order to &s;ecure her from the re&s;entment of his queen, who, from having been formerly incontinent her&s;elf, now became jealous of his
<PB N="256" REF="266">
incontinence, he concealed her in a labyrinth in Wood&s;tock Park, where he pa&s;&s;ed in her company his hours of vacancy and plea&s;ure. How long this &s;ecret intercour&s;e continued is not told us; but it was not &s;o clo&s;ely concealed but that it came to the queen's knowledge, who, as the accounts add, being guided by a clew of &s;ilk to her fair rival's retreat, obliged her, by holding a drawn dagger to her brea&s;t, to &s;wallow poi&s;on. Whatever may be the veracity of this &s;tory, certain it is, that this haughty woman, though formerly offen&s;ive by her own gallantries, was now no le&s;s &s;o by her jealou&s;y; and &s;he it was who fir&s;t &s;owed the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the king and his children.</P>
<P>Young Henry was taught to believe him&s;elf injured; when upon being crowned as partner in the kingdom, he was not admitted into a &s;hare of the admini&s;tration. This prince had, from the beginning, &s;hewn a degree of pride that &s;eems to have been hereditary to all the Nor|man &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: when the ceremony of his coronation was performing, the king, willing to give it all the &s;plendour po&s;&s;ible, waited upon him at table; and while he offered him the cup ob&s;erved, that no prince ever before had been &s;o magnificently attended. There is no|thing very extraordinary, replied the young
<PB N="257" REF="267">
prince, in &s;eeing the &s;on of a count &s;erving the &s;on of a king. From this in&s;tance, nothing &s;eemed great enough to &s;atisfy his ambition; and he took the fir&s;t opportunity to a&s;&s;ert his a&s;piring preten&s;ions. The di&s;content of young Henry was &s;oon followed by that of Geoffry and Richard, whom the queen per&s;uaded to a&s;|&s;ert their title to the territories a&s;&s;igned them; and upon the king's refu&s;ing their undutiful demands, they all fled &s;ecretly to the court of France, where Lewis, who was in&s;trumental in encrea&s;ing their di&s;obedience, gave them coun|tenance and protection. Queen Eleanor her|&s;elf was meditating an e&s;cape to the &s;ame court, and had put on man's apparel for that purpo&s;e, when &s;he was &s;eized by the king's order and put into confinement. Thus Henry &s;aw all his long per&s;pective of future hap|pine&s;s totally clouded; his &s;ons, &s;carce yet ar|rived at manhood, eager to &s;hare the &s;poils of their father's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; his queen warmly encouraging tho&s;e undutiful princes in their rebellion, and many potentates of Europe not a&s;hamed to lend them a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;upport their preten&s;ions. Nor was his pro&s;pects much more plea&s;ing when he looked among his &s;ub|jects: his licentious barons, di&s;gu&s;ted with a vigilant government, de&s;ired to be governed by
<PB N="258" REF="268">
princes whom they could flatter or intimidate: the clergy had not yet forgot Becket's death; and the people con&s;idered him as a &s;aint and a martyr. In this univer&s;al di&s;affection, Henry &s;upported that intrepidity which he had &s;hown through life, and prepared for a conte&s;t from which he could expect to reap neither profit nor glory. Twenty thou&s;and mercenary &s;oldiers, joined to &s;ome troops which he brought over from Ireland, and a few barons of approved fidelity, formed the &s;ole force with which he propo&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t his opponents.</P>
<P>It was not long before the young princes had &s;ufficient influence upon the continent to rai&s;e a powerful confederacy in their favour. Be|&s;ide the king of France, Philip count of Flan|ders, Matthew count of Bologne, Theobald count of Blois, and Henry count of Eu, all declared them&s;elves in their intere&s;ts. Wil|liam, king of Scotland, al&s;o made one of this a&s;&s;ociation, and a plan was concerted for a ge|neral inva&s;ion of Henry's exten&s;ive dominions. This was &s;hortly after put into execution. The king's continental dominions were invaded on one &s;ide, by the counts of Flanders and Bou|logne; on the other by the king of France, with a large army, which the young Engli&s;h princes animated by their pre&s;ence and popularity. But
<PB N="259" REF="269">
Henry found means to oppo&s;e them on every quarter: the count of Boulogne, being mortally wounded in the a&s;&s;ault of the town of Drincourt,<MILESTONE N="1173" UNIT="A.D."> his death &s;topped the progre&s;s of the Flemi&s;h arms on that &s;ide. The French army being oblig|ed to retire from the &s;iege of Verneuil, Henry attacked their rear, put them to the rout, and took &s;everal pri&s;oners. The barons of Brit|tany al&s;o, who had ri&s;en in favour of the young princes, &s;hared no better fate; their army was defeated in the field, and, taking &s;helter in the town of Dol, were there made pri&s;oners of war. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es repre&s;&s;ed the pride and the expectations of the confe|derated forces, and a conference was demand|ed by the French king, to which Henry readily agreed. In this interview, he had the mortification to &s;ee his three &s;ons, ranged on the &s;ide of his mortal and inveterate ene|my; but he was &s;till more di&s;appointed to find that their demands ro&s;e with their incapacity to obtain them by compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>While Henry was thus quelling the in&s;o|lence of his foreign enemies, his Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects were in no &s;mall danger of revolting from their obedience at home. The nobility were in general united to oppo&s;e him; and an irruption at this time by the king of Scotland,
<PB N="260" REF="270">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted their &s;chemes of in&s;urrection. The earl of Leice&s;ter, at the head of a body of Flemmings, invaded Suffolk, but were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter. The earl of Ferrars, Roger de Mowbray, and many others of equal dignity, ro&s;e in arms; while, the more to aug|ment the confu&s;ion, the king of Scotland broke into the northern provinces with an army of eighty thou&s;and men, which laid the whole country into one exten&s;ive &s;cene of de&s;olation. Henry, from baffling his enemies in France, flew over to oppo&s;e tho&s;e in England; but his long di&s;&s;ention with Becket &s;till was remem|bered again&s;t him, and it was his intere&s;t to per&s;uade the clergy, as well as the people, that he was no way acce&s;&s;ory to his murder. All the world now began to think the dead prelate a &s;aint; and if we con&s;ider the ignorance of the times, perhaps Henry him&s;elf thought &s;o too. He had &s;ome time before taken proper precautions to exculpate him&s;elf to the pope, and given him the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es to perform whatever penances the church &s;hould inflict. He had engaged the Chri&s;tmas following to take the cro&s;s; and, if the pope in&s;i&s;ted on it, to &s;erve three years again&s;t the infidels, either in Spain or Pale&s;tine; and promi&s;ed not to &s;top appeals to the holy &s;ee. The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions &s;eemed to
<PB N="261" REF="271">
&s;atisfy the court of Rome for that time; but they were, neverthele&s;s, every day putting Henry in mind of his promi&s;e, and demand|ing tho&s;e humiliations for his offences to the &s;aint, that could alone reconcile him to the church. He now, therefore, found it the mo&s;t proper conjuncture to obey, and, knowing the influence of &s;uper&s;tition over the minds of the people, and perhaps apprehen&s;ive that a part of his troubles aro&s;e from the di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven, he re&s;olved to do penance at the &s;hrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury, for that was the name given to Becket upon his canonization. As &s;oon as he came within &s;ight of the church of Canterbury, alighting from his hor&s;e, he walked barefoot towards the town, pro&s;trated him&s;elf before the &s;hrine of the &s;aint, re|mained in fa&s;ting and prayer a whole day, watched all night the holy relics, made a grant of fifty pounds a year to the convent, for a con&s;tant &s;upply of tapers to illuminate the &s;hrine; and, not &s;atisfied with the&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, he a&s;&s;embled a chapter of monks, di&s;robed be|fore them, put a &s;courge of di&s;cipline into each of their hands, and pre&s;ented his bare &s;houlders to their infliction. Next day he re|ceived ab&s;olution; and departing for London, received the agreeable news of a victory over
<PB N="262" REF="272">
the Scots, obtained on the very day of his ab|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Having thus made his peace with the church, and brought over the minds of the people, he fought upon &s;urer grounds; every victory he obtained was imputed to the favour of the re|conciled &s;aint, and every &s;ucce&s;s thus tended to a&s;certain the growing confidence of his party. The victory which was gained over the Scots was &s;ignal and deci&s;ive. William, their king, after having committed the mo&s;t horrible de|predations upon the northern frontiers, had thought proper to retreat upon the advance of an Engli&s;h army, commanded by Ralph de Glanville, the famous Engli&s;h lawyer. As he had fixed his &s;tation at Alnwick, he thought him&s;elf perfectly &s;ecure, from the remotene&s;s of the enemy, again&s;t any attack. In this however he was deceived; for Glanville, informed of his &s;ituation, made an ha&s;ty and fatiguing march to the place of his encampment, and ap|proached it very nearly during the ob&s;curity of a mi&s;t. The Scotch, who continued in per|fect &s;ecurity, were &s;urprized in the morning to find them&s;elves attacked by the enemy, which they thought at &s;uch a di&s;tance; and their king venturing with a &s;mall body of an hundred hor&s;e to oppo&s;e the a&s;&s;ailants, was
<PB N="263" REF="273">
quickly &s;urrounded and taken pri&s;oner. His troops hearing of his di&s;a&s;ter, fled on all &s;ides with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and made the be&s;t of their way to their own country.</P>
<P>From that time Henry's affairs began to wear a better a&s;pect; the barons, who had re|volted or were preparing for a revolt, made in|&s;tant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they delivered up their ca&s;tles to the victor, and England in a few weeks was re&s;tored to perfect tranquility. Young Henry, who was ready to embark with a large army, to &s;econd the efforts of the Engli&s;h in|&s;urgents, finding all di&s;turbances quieted at home, abandoned all thoughts of the expedi|tion. Lewis attempted in vain to be&s;iege Rou|en, which Henry ha&s;tened over to &s;uccour. A ce&s;&s;ation of arms and a conference was once more agreed upon by the two monarchs. Henry granted his &s;ons much le&s;s advantageous terms than they formerly refu&s;ed to accept: the mo&s;t material, were &s;ome pen&s;ions for their &s;upport, &s;ome ca&s;tles for their re&s;idence, and an indemnity to all their adherents. Thus Eng|land once more emerged from the numerous calamities that threatened to overwhelm it, and the king was now left at free liberty to make various provi&s;ions for the glory, the happine&s;s, and the &s;ecurity of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="274">His fir&s;t care was to make his pri&s;oner, the king of Scots, undergo a proper puni&s;hment for his unmerited and ungenerous attack. That prince was content to &s;ign a treaty, by which he was compelled to do homage to Henry for his dominions in Scotland. It was agreed, that his barons and bi&s;hops al&s;o &s;hould do the &s;ame; and that the fortre&s;&s;es of Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, Roxborough, and Jedbo|rough, &s;hould be delivered into the hands of the conqueror till the articles were performed. This treaty was punctually and rigorou&s;ly exe|cuted; the king, barons, and prelates of Scot|land did homage to Henry in the cathedral of York; &s;o that he might now be con&s;idered as the monarch of the whole i&s;land, the moun|tainous parts of Wales only excepted.</P>
<P>His dome&s;tic regulations were as wife as his political conduct was &s;plendid. He enacted &s;evere penalties again&s;t robbery, murder, fal&s;e coining, and burning of hou&s;es; ordaining that the&s;e crimes &s;hould be puni&s;hed by the amputa|tion of the right-hand and right-foot. The or|deal trial by water, though it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, was yet &s;o far weakened, as that if a per&s;on who came off in this &s;crutiny were legally convicted by creditable te&s;timony, he &s;hould neverthe|le&s;s &s;uffer bani&s;hment. He partitioned out the
<PB N="265" REF="275">
kingdom into four divi&s;ions; and appointed itinerant ju&s;tices to go their re&s;pective circuits to try cau&s;es, to re&s;train the cruelties of the barons, and to protect the lower ranks of the people in &s;ecurity. He renewed the trial by ju|ries, which, by the barbarous method of camp-fight, was almo&s;t grown ob&s;olete. He demo|li&s;hed all the new-erected ca&s;tles that had been built in the times of anarchy and general con|fu&s;ion; and, to &s;ecure the kingdom more ef|fectually again&s;t any threatened inva&s;ion, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a well-armed militia, which, with proper accoutrements, &s;pecified in the act, were to defend the realm upon any emergency.</P>
<P>But it was not in the power of wi&s;dom to conciliate the turbulent and ambitious &s;pirits of his &s;ons, who, not contented with rebel|ling again&s;t their father, now warmly pro&s;e|cuted their enmities again&s;t each other. Rich|ard,<MILESTONE N="1180" UNIT="A.D."> whom Henry had made ma&s;ter of Gui|enne, and who had already di&s;played great marks of valour in humbling his mutinous barons, refu&s;ed to obey his father's orders in doing homage to his elder brother for that duchy. Young Henry and Geoffry, uniting their arms, carried war into their brother's dominions; and while the king was endea|vouring to compo&s;e their differences, he found
<PB N="266" REF="276">
him&s;elf &s;ecretly con&s;pired again&s;t by all. What the re&s;ult of this con&s;piracy might be, is uncertain; for it was defeated by the death of young Henry, who died in the twenty-&s;ixth year of his age, of a fever, at Martel, not with|out the deepe&s;t remor&s;e for his undutiful conduct towards his father.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1183" UNIT="A.D."> As this prince left no po&s;terity, Richard was become heir in his room; and he &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;ame ardent ambition that had mi&s;led his elder brother. He refu&s;ed to obey his father's commands in giving up Guienne, which he had been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; and even made preparations to attack his brother Geoffry, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Brittany. No &s;ooner was this breach made up, at the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of the queen, than Geoffry broke out into violence, and demanded Anjou to be an|nexed to his dominions of Brittany. This being refu&s;ed him, he followed the old undu|tiful method of procuring redre&s;s, fled to the court of France, and prepared to levy an army again&s;t his father. Henry was freed from the danger that threatened him on that quarter, by the affliction of his &s;on's death, who was killed in a tournament at Paris. The lo&s;s of this prince gave few, except the king him&s;elf, any unea&s;ine&s;s, as he was univer&s;ally hated, and
<PB N="267" REF="277">
went among the people under the opprobious name of <HI>The Child of Perdition.</HI></P>
<P>But the death of the prince did not wholly remove the cau&s;e of his revolt; for Philip, the king of France, di&s;puted his title to the ward&s;hip of Arthur, the &s;on of Geoffry, who was now become duke of Brittany, upon the death of his father. Some other cau&s;es of di&s;&s;en&s;ion enflamed the di&s;pute between the two monarchs. Philip had once more de|bauched Richard from his duty; and in&s;i&s;ted upon his marriage being completed with Ade|lais, the &s;i&s;ter of France; and threatened to enforce his preten&s;ions by a formidable inva|&s;ion. In con&s;equence of this claim, another conference was held between Gi&s;ors and Trie, the u&s;ual place of meeting, under a va&s;t elm, that is &s;aid to have &s;haded more than an acre. It was in the mid&s;t of this conference upon their mutual rights, that a new object of in|tere&s;t was offered to their con&s;ideration; and that quickly bore down all &s;ecular con&s;idera|tions before it. The archbi&s;hop of Tyre ap|peared before the a&s;&s;embly in the mo&s;t mi&s;er|able habit, and with looks calculated to in|&s;pire compa&s;&s;ion. He had come from the Holy Land, and had &s;een the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tians, who were appointed to defend
<PB N="268" REF="278">
the Holy Sepulchre, and was a witne&s;s of the triumph of the infidels. He painted the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e champions of the cro&s;s in the mo&s;t pa|thetic manner; he deplored their bravery and their misfortunes. The Chri&s;tians, about a century before, had attacked and taken Jeru&s;alem; but the Saracens recovered courage after the fir&s;t torrent of &s;ucce&s;s was pa&s;t, and being every day reinforced by fre&s;h &s;upplies, at la&s;t conquered by per&s;everance a land of warriors, who, in common, preferring celibacy to mar|riage, had not multiplied in the ordinary me|thods of population. The holy city it&s;elf was &s;oon re-taken by the victorious arms of Saladin; and all Pale&s;tine, except a few ma|ritime towns, was entirely &s;ubdued. Nothing now therefore remained of tho&s;e boa&s;ted con|que&s;ts, that had rai&s;ed the glory, and enflamed the zeal of the we&s;tern world; and nothing was to be &s;een, of what near a century before had em|ployed the efforts of all the noble&s;t &s;pirits of Eu|rope to acquire. The we&s;tern Chri&s;tians were a&s;toni&s;hed at receiving this di&s;mal intelligence; the whole audience bur&s;t into tears; the two kings laid a&s;ide their animo&s;ity, and agreed to convert their whole attention to the re&s;cuing Jeru&s;alem from the hands of the infidels. They in&s;tantly therefore took the cro&s;s; many of
<PB N="269" REF="279">
their mo&s;t con&s;iderable va&s;&s;als imitated their example; and as the emperor Frederic I. en|tered into the &s;ame confederacy, it was univer|&s;ally expected that nothing could re&s;i&s;t their united endeavours. But it was the fate of Henry to be cro&s;&s;ed in his mo&s;t darling pur&s;uits by his undutiful and ungrateful children.</P>
<P>Richard, who had long wi&s;hed to have all the glory of &s;uch an expedition to him&s;elf, and who could not bear to have even his father a partner in his victories, entered into a confe|deracy with the king of France, who promi&s;ed to confirm him in tho&s;e wi&s;hes, at which he &s;o ardently a&s;pired. He therefore began by mak|ing an inroad into the territories of the count of Thoulou&s;e, a va&s;&s;al to the king of France; and this monarch, in order to retaliate, carried war into the provinces of Berri and Auvergne. Henry, who was apprized of their &s;ecret confe|deracy, neverthele&s;s attempted to make depre|dations in turn upon the dominions of the French king. Conferences were propo&s;ed, attended, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. At length, Henry found him&s;elf obliged to give up all hopes of taking the cro&s;s, and compelled to enter upon a war with France and his elde&s;t &s;on, who were unnaturally lea|gued again&s;t him. He now &s;aw the confe|deracy daily gaining ground. Ferte Ber|nard
<PB N="270" REF="280">
fell fir&s;t into the hands of the enemy; Mans was next taken by a&s;&s;ault; Amboi&s;e, Chaumont, and Chatteau de Loire, opened their gates upon the enemies appearance; Tours was inve&s;ted; and the king, who had retired to Saumur, and had daily in&s;tances of the cowardice and infidelity of his governors, expected the mo&s;t di&s;mal i&s;&s;ue of all his en|terprizes. While he was in this &s;tate of de|&s;pondency, the duke of Burgundy, the count of Flanders, and archbi&s;hop of Rheims, in|terpo&s;ed their good offices; and at la&s;t a treaty was concluded, in which he &s;ubmitted to many mortifying conce&s;&s;ions. It was agreed that Richard &s;hould marry the prince&s;s Ade|lais, and be crowned king of England during the life-time of his father. It was &s;tipulated, that Henry &s;hould pay twenty thou&s;and marks to the king of France, as a compen&s;ation for the charges of the war; that his own barons &s;hould engage to make him ob&s;erve this treaty; and in ca&s;e of violating it, to join Philip and Richard again&s;t him; and that all his va&s;&s;als who e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Richard, &s;hould re|ceive an indemnity for the offence. The&s;e were terms &s;ufficiently humiliating to a prince accu&s;tomed to give, not receive, commands; but what was his re&s;entment, when, upon de|manding
<PB N="271" REF="281">
a li&s;t of the barons that were to be thus pardoned, he found his &s;on John, his fa|vourite child, among the number. He had long borne an infirm &s;tate of body with calm re&s;ignation; he had &s;een his children rebel without much emotion; he &s;aw his own &s;on his conqueror, him&s;elf bereft of his power, re|duced to the condition of a fugitive, and al|mo&s;t &s;uppliant, in his old age; and all this he endured with tranquillity of temper: but when he &s;aw that child, who&s;e intere&s;ts always lay next his heart, among the number of tho&s;e who were in rebellion again&s;t him, he could no longer contain his indignation. He broke out into expre&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t de&s;pair; cur&s;ed the day in which he had received his mi&s;erable being; and be&s;towed on his ungrate|ful children a malediction, which he never af|ter could be prevailed upon to retract. The more his heart was di&s;po&s;ed to friend&s;hip and affection, the more he re&s;ented this barbarous return; and now, not having one corner in his heart where he could look for comfort, or fly for refuge from his conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, he lo&s;t all his former vivacity. A lingering fever, cau&s;ed by a broken heart, &s;oon after terminated his life and his mi&s;eries. He died at the ca&s;tle of Chinon, near Saumur.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="282">His corp&s;e was conveyed by his natural &s;on Geoffry, who of all his children behaved with duty, to the nunnery of Fontevrault; and next day, while it lay in the abbey-church, Rich|ard chancing to enter, was &s;truck with horror at the &s;ight. At his approach, the blood was &s;een to gu&s;h out at the mouth and no&s;trils of the corp&s;e; and this which, without doubt, was accidental, was interpreted by the &s;uper|&s;tition of the times, as the mo&s;t dreadful re|buke. Richard could not endure the &s;ight. He exclaimed, that he was his father's mur|derer; and expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong, though late, &s;en&s;e of that undutiful conduct, which brought his parent to an untimely grave.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1189" UNIT="A.D."> Thus died Henry, in the fifty eighth year of his age, and the thirty-fifth of his reign; in the cour&s;e of which he di&s;played all the abilities of a politician, all the &s;agacity of a legi&s;lator, and all the magnanimity of an hero. He was of a middle &s;tature, &s;trong and well proportioned, his countenance was lively and engaging; his conver&s;ation affable and enter|taining; his elocution ea&s;y, per&s;ua&s;ive, and ever at command. When he could enjoy lei|&s;ure, he recreated him&s;elf, either in learned conver&s;ation or reading, and he cultivated his natural talents by &s;tudy above any prince of his

time. During his reign, all foreign improve|ments in literature and politene&s;s, in laws and arts, &s;eem to have been, in a good mea&s;ure, tran&s;|planted into England. The little learning of the Saxon prie&s;ts, which was confined to church hi&s;tory, and legendary tales, was now exchanged for the &s;ubtleties of &s;chool-philo&s;ophy. The homely manners of the great were &s;oftened by the pomps of chivalry. The people, how|ever, were as yet far from being civilized; and even in their cities, where the &s;ocial arts were be&s;t cultivated, there were amazing in|&s;tances of barbarity. It was common, for in|&s;tance, in London, for great numbers, to the amount of an hundred, or more, of the &s;ons and relations of eminent citizens, to form them&s;elves into a confederacy to plunder and rob their more wealthy neighbours. By the&s;e crimes it was become &s;o dangerous to walk the &s;treets at night, that the citizens, af|ter dark, were obliged to continue within doors. A band of the&s;e ruffians had one day attacked the hou&s;e of a rich citizen, with an intention to plunder it. They had already broke through a &s;tone wall with hammers and wedges; and were actually entering the hou&s;e &s;word in hand, when the citizen, in compleat armour, &s;upported by his &s;ervants, appeared
<PB N="274" REF="284">
in the pa&s;&s;age to oppo&s;e them. He cut off the right hand of the fir&s;t robber that entered; and made &s;uch a noble re&s;i&s;tance, that his neighbours had time to a&s;&s;emble, and come to his relief. The man who lo&s;t his hand was caught; and was tempted by the promi&s;e of a pardon to reveal his confederates, among whom was one John Senex, e&s;teemed among the riche&s;t and the be&s;t born citizens of London. He was convicted by the ordeal trial; and though he offered five hundred marks for his life, the king refu&s;ed the money, and ordered him to be hanged.</P>
<P>Henry left only two legitimate &s;ons, Rich|ard who &s;ucceeded him; and John, who inhe|rited no territory, and therefore received the &s;urname of Lackland. He left three legiti|mate daughters, Maud, who was married to the duke of Saxony, Eleanor married to Al|phon&s;o, king of Ca&s;tile, and Joan, to William, king of Sicily. He left two natural &s;ons by Ro&s;amond; Richard Long&s;word, who was af|terwards married to the daughter, and heire&s;s, of the earl of Sali&s;bury; and Geoffry, who was afterwards archbi&s;hop of York.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. IX. RICHARD I. &s;urnamed COEUR DE LION.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD, who &s;ucceeded to the throne without oppo&s;ition, &s;eemed re&s;olved to di&s;cou|rage future di&s;obedience, by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing from his &s;ervice all tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his former undutiful conduct. Tho&s;e who had &s;econded his rebellion, in&s;tead of meeting with that tru&s;t and honour which they expected, were treated with &s;corn and neglect. He re|tained
<PB N="276" REF="286">
in his &s;ervice all the loyal adherents of the late king; and more than once ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who were faithful to one &s;overeign, would probably continue &s;o to another. He in&s;tantly, upon his acce&s;&s;ion, relea&s;ed his mo|ther from confinement; and was profu&s;e in heaping favours upon his brother John, who afterwards made but a very indifferent return for this indulgence.</P>
<P>But the king was no way &s;u&s;picious in his temper; nor did he give much attention to his own &s;ecurity, being more earne&s;tly &s;olici|tous of fame. A romantic de&s;ire for &s;trange adventures, and an immoderate zeal for the external rites of Chri&s;tianity, were the ruling pa&s;&s;ions of the times. By the&s;e alone glory was to be acquired; and by the&s;e Richard only hoped for glory. The Jews, who had been for &s;ome time encrea&s;ing in the kingdom, were the fir&s;t who fell a &s;acrifice to the enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal of the people; and great numbers of them were &s;laughtered by the citizens of Lon|don, upon the very day of the king's corona|tion. Five hundred of that infatuated peo|ple had retired into York ca&s;tle for &s;afety; but finding them&s;elves unable to defend the place, they re&s;olved to peri&s;h by killing one another, rather than tru&s;t the fury of their per&s;ecutors.
<PB N="277" REF="287">
Having taken this gloomy re&s;olution, they fir&s;t murdered their wives and children; next threw the dead bodies over the wall again&s;t their ene|mies, who attempted to &s;cale it; and then &s;et|ting fire to the hou&s;es, peri&s;hed in the flames.</P>
<P>This horrid ma&s;&s;acre, which was in it&s;elf &s;o impolitic and unju&s;t, in&s;tead of tarni&s;hing the lu&s;tre of this monarch's reign, was then con&s;i|dered as a mo&s;t &s;plendid commencement of his government; and the people were from thence led to form the mo&s;t favourable &s;enti|ments of his future glory. Nor was it long before he &s;hewed him&s;elf perfectly fitted to gratify their mo&s;t romantic de&s;ires. Perhaps impelled more by a love of military glory, than actuated by &s;uper&s;tition, he re&s;olved upon an expedition to the Holy Land, and took every method to rai&s;e money for &s;o expen&s;ive an undertaking. His father had left him a trea&s;ure of above an hundred thou&s;and marks; and this &s;um he endeavoured to augment by all expedients, however pernicious to the pub|lic, or dangerous to royal authority. He &s;et up to &s;ale the revenues and manors of the crown, and &s;everal offices of the greate&s;t tru&s;t and power. Liberties, charters, ca&s;tles, and employments, were given to the be&s;t bidders. When &s;ome of his friends &s;ugge&s;ted the dan|ger
<PB N="278" REF="288">
attending this venality, he told them he would &s;ell the city of London it&s;elf, if he could find a purcha&s;er. In the&s;e times we find but one man who was hone&s;t enough to retire from employment, when places were become thus ignominious. This was the great lawyer Glan|ville, who re&s;igned his po&s;t of ju&s;ticiary, and took the cro&s;s. Richard was not much di&s;|plea&s;ed at his re&s;ignation, as he was able &s;hortly after to &s;ell his employment to Hugh, bi&s;hop of Durham, who gave a thou&s;and marks for the office. Thus the king, elated with the hopes of fame, was blind to every other con|&s;ideration. Numerous exactions were practi&s;ed upon people of all ranks and &s;tations; me|naces, promi&s;es, expo&s;tulations, were u&s;ed to fright the timid, or allure the avaricious. A zealous preacher of tho&s;e times was &s;o far em|boldened as to remon&s;trate again&s;t the king's conduct; and advi&s;ed him to part with his three daughters, which were pride, avarice, and &s;en&s;uality. To this Richard readily re|plied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You coun&s;el right, my friend; and I have already provided hu&s;bands for them all. I will di&s;po&s;e of my pride to the templars; my avarice to the monks; and as for my &s;en&s;uality, the clergy &s;hall &s;hare that among them."</Q> At length, the king having got
<PB N="279" REF="289">
together a &s;ufficient &s;upply for his undertaking; and having even &s;old his &s;uperiority over the kingdom of Scotland, which had been acquired in the la&s;t reign, for a moderate &s;um, he &s;et out for the Holy Land, whither he was impelled by repeated me&s;&s;ages from the king of France, who was ready to embark in the &s;ame enter|prize.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place of rendezvous for the two armies of England and France was the plain of Verelay, on the borders of Bur|gundy, where, when Richard and Philip ar|rived, they found their armies amounting to an hundred thou&s;and fighting men. The&s;e were all ardent in the cau&s;e; the flower of all the military in both dominions, and provided with all the implements and accoutrements of war. Here the French prince, and the Engli&s;h, en|tered into the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements of mutual &s;upport; and having determined to conduct their armies to the Holy Land by &s;ea, they parted, one for Genoa, the other for Mar&s;eilles, with a view of meeting the fleets that were to attend them at their re&s;pective &s;tations. It was not long after that both fleets put to &s;ea; and nearly about the &s;ame time were obliged, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, to take &s;helter in Me&s;&s;ina, the capital of Sicily, where
<PB N="280" REF="290">
they were detained during the whole winter. Richard took up his quarters in the &s;uburbs, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a &s;mall fort, which commanded the harbour. Philip quartered his troops in the town, and lived upon good terms with the Sicilian king.</P>
<P>It is now unknown what gave ri&s;e to a quar|rel, which happened &s;oon after, between the Sici|lians and the Engli&s;h; it is doubtful whether the intrigues of the French king, or the violent proceedings of Richard. Certain it is, that the Me&s;&s;ine&s;e &s;oon took occa&s;ion to treat the Eng|li&s;h with great in&s;olence; &s;hut their gates, manned their walls, and &s;et Richard at defi|ance. Richard, who had hitherto acted as a friend, endeavoured to u&s;e the mediation of Philip to compromi&s;e this quarrel; but while the two monarchs were yet in deliberation, a body of Sicilians i&s;&s;ued from the town, and at|tacked the Engli&s;h with great impetuo&s;ity. This in&s;ult was &s;ufficient to excite the fury of Richard, who naturally bold, and con&s;cious of his own &s;uperior force, a&s;&s;aulted the city with &s;uch fury, that it was &s;oon taken, and the &s;tandard of England di&s;played on the ram|parts. Philip, who con&s;idered the place as his quarters, exclaimed again&s;t the in&s;ult, and ordered &s;ome of his troops to pull down that
<PB N="281" REF="291">
mark of his di&s;grace. To this, however, Rich|ard returned for an&s;wer, that he was willing to take down the &s;tandard, &s;ince it di&s;plea&s;ed his a&s;&s;ociate; but that no power on earth &s;hould compel him to do &s;o. This was &s;ufficient to produce a mutual jealou&s;y between the&s;e two princes, which never after &s;ub&s;ided; but which was &s;till more enflamed by the oppo&s;ition of their tempers.</P>
<P>Many were the mi&s;tru&s;ts, and the mutual reconciliations between the&s;e two monarchs, which were very probably inflamed by the Si|cilian king's endeavours. At length, however, having &s;ettled all controver&s;ies, they &s;et &s;ail for the Holy Land, where the French arrived long before the Engli&s;h. The little knowlege that was then had of the art of &s;ailing, made that pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea very long and dangerous, which is now con&s;idered as &s;o trifling. Richard's fleet was once more encountered by a tempe&s;t, and two of the &s;hips driven upon the coa&s;t of the i&s;land of Cyprus. I&s;aac, who was then prince of that country, either impelled by ava|rice, or willing to di&s;courage the re&s;t of Rich|ard's fleet from landing, pillaged the &s;hips that were &s;tranded, and threw the &s;eamen and &s;ol|diers into pri&s;on. But Richard, who &s;oon af|ter arrived, took ample vengeance for that in|jury.
<PB N="282" REF="292">
He di&s;embarked his troops, defeated the tyrant, entered the capital by &s;torm, obliged I&s;aac to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, and took the i&s;land into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was there that Richard married Berengaria, daughter to the king of Navarre, who had attended him in his expedition; and whom he had preferred to Adelais, the king of France's &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e charms were not &s;o powerful, or who&s;e fidelity was more &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the Engli&s;h army in Pale&s;tine, fortune was &s;een to declare more open|ly in favour of the common cau&s;e. The French and Engli&s;h princes &s;eemed to forget their &s;ecret jealou&s;ies, and act in concert. In be|&s;ieging the city of Acres, while the one made the attack the other guarded the trenches; and this duty they formed each day alternately. By this conduct that garri&s;on, after a long and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, was obliged to capitulate; and, upon condition of having their lives &s;pared, they promi&s;ed to re&s;tore all the pri&s;oners that had been made by the Saracens, and to deliver up the wood of the true cro&s;s. Such were the amazing advantages that attended an enter|prize that had laid A&s;ia in blood; and had, in a great mea&s;ure, depopulated Europe of its brave&s;t forces.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="293">Immediately after the conque&s;t of this place, Philip, either di&s;gu&s;ted at the a&s;cendant a&s;&s;umed by Richard, and perhaps di&s;plea&s;ed at his &s;upe|rior popularity, declared his re&s;olution of reti|ring to France. He pleaded the bad &s;tate of his health in excu&s;e for his de&s;ertion; and, to give a colour to his friendly profe&s;&s;ions, he left Richard ten thou&s;and of his troops under the command of the duke of Burgundy. Richard,<MILESTONE N="1191" UNIT="A.D."> being now left &s;ole conductor of the war, went on from victory to victory. The chri&s;tian adventurers, under his command, determined to be&s;iege the renowed city of A&s;calon, in order to prepare the way for attacking Jeru&s;alem with greater advantage. Saladin, the mo&s;t renowned of all the Saracen monarchs, was re&s;olved to di&s;|pute their march, and placed him&s;elf upon the road with an army of three hundred thou&s;and men. This was a day equal to Richard's wi&s;hes, this an enemy worthy his highe&s;t am|bition. The Engli&s;h cru&s;ades were victorious. Richard, when the wings of his army were de|feated, led on the main body in per&s;on, and re|&s;tored the battle. The Saracens fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and no le&s;s than forty thou|&s;and of their number peri&s;hed on the field of battle. A&s;calon &s;oon &s;urrendered after this victory; other cities of le&s;s note followed the
<PB N="284" REF="294">
example, and Richard was at la&s;t able to ad|vance within &s;ight of Jeru&s;alem, the object of his long and ardent expectations. But, ju&s;t at this glorious juncture, his ambition was to &s;uffer a total overthrow; upon reviewing his forces, and con&s;idering his abilities to pro&s;e|cute the &s;iege, he found that his army was &s;o wa&s;ted with famine, fatigue, and even with victory, that they were neither able, nor willing to &s;econd the views of their commander. It appeared, therefore, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to come to an accommodation with Saladin; and a truce for three years was accordingly con|cluded, in which it was agreed, that the &s;ea|port towns of Pale&s;tine &s;hould remain in the hands of the chri&s;tians; and that all of that religion &s;hould be permitted to make their pilgrimage to Jeru&s;alem in perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Richard, having thus concluded his expe|dition with more glory than advantage, be|gan to think of returning home, and of en|joying in tranquility tho&s;e honours which he had reaped with &s;o much danger. But he was at a lo&s;s how to proceed. If he &s;hould take &s;hipping, and return by the way he came, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily put him&s;elf into the power of the king of France, from who&s;e re&s;entment he had every thing to fear. No way, there|fore,
<PB N="285" REF="295">
was left but by going more to the north; wherefore taking &s;hipping for Italy, he was once more wrecked near Aquileia. From thence directing his travels towards Ragufa, and putting on the di&s;gui&s;e of a pilgrim, he re&s;olved to make his way, in that private man|ner, through Germany. But unfortunately, his intentions and per&s;on were not &s;o concealed, but that his quality was &s;u&s;pected; and the gover|nor of I&s;tria pur&s;ued him, in order to make him a pri&s;oner. Being thus forced from the direct road, and now become a fugitive, he was obliged to pa&s;s by Vienna, where his expences and libe|ralities betraying his dignity, tho' di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of a pilgrim, he was arre&s;ted by Leo|pold duke of Au&s;tria, who commanded him to be impri&s;oned and loaded with &s;hackles, to the di&s;grace of honour and humanity. This prince had &s;erved under Richard at the &s;iege of Acres; and being di&s;gu&s;ted on &s;ome af|front, offered him by his commander on that occa&s;ion, he took this ba&s;e method of retaliat|ing the injury. His avarice, al&s;o, might have had a &s;hare in this procedure, as he expected a large &s;hare of that ran&s;om which he knew would be given by the Engli&s;h to extricate their king from bondage. Henry the &s;ixth, who was then emperor of Germany, was equal|ly
<PB N="286" REF="296">
an enemy to Richard, on account of the al|liance contracted between him, and Tancred king of Sicily, by his marriage with Berenga|ria. When therefore, &s;hortly after, he re|ceived the news of Richard's being in cu&s;tody, he required the pri&s;oner to be delivered up to him, and &s;tipulated a large &s;um of money to the duke as a reward for this &s;ervice. Thus the king of England, who had long filled the world with his fame, was ba&s;ely thrown into a dungeon, and loaded with irons, by tho&s;e who expected to reap a &s;ordid advantage from his misfortunes. It was a long time before his &s;ubjects in England knew what was become of their beloved monarch. So little intercour&s;e was there between different nations at that time, that this di&s;covery is &s;aid by &s;ome to have been made by a poor French min&s;trel, who playing upon his harp near the fortre&s;s in which Ri|chard was confined, a tune which he knew that unhappy monarch was fond of, he was an&s;wered by the king from within, who with his harp played the &s;ame tune; and thus di&s;|covered the place of his confinement.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while Richard was thus fruitle&s;sly victorious, and afterwards mi&s;erably confined, his affairs in England were in a very unpro&s;perous &s;ituation. The kingdom, as has
<PB N="287" REF="297">
been before ob&s;erved, was put under the go|vernment of two prelates, one of whom had bought his place, and the other had ari&s;en to it by the meane&s;t arts of adulation. The bi&s;hop of Durham was ignorant and avaricious. Long|champ his colleague was naturally proud, and &s;till more elated by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing his ma&s;ter's favour. Tempers &s;o oppo|&s;ite &s;oon began their enmity; and Longchamp went even &s;o far, as to arre&s;t the per&s;on of his colleague; who was obliged to re&s;ign his power to obtain his liberty. It was to no purpo&s;e, that the king by his letters commanded Long|champ to re-place his co-adjutor; this haughty prelate refu&s;ed to obey, alledging that he knew the king's &s;ecret intentions better than to com|ply. He proceeded, therefore, &s;till to govern the kingdom alone; and as he knew his &s;itua|tion was precarious, he encrea&s;ed the number of his guards, without which he never ventured from his palace. In the univer&s;al di&s;gu&s;t, which &s;o much power and magnificence na|turally produced again&s;t him, there were none in the kingdom hardy enough to controul his will, except John the king's brother, who, hav|ing been per&s;onally di&s;obliged by this prelate, was willing to catch the pre&s;ent favourable oc|ca&s;ion, of univer&s;al di&s;content, to oppo&s;e him|&s;elf
<PB N="288" REF="298">
to his power. He accordingly ventured to &s;ummon, at Reading, a general council of the nobility and prelates; and cited Long|champ to appear before them. Longchamp, &s;en&s;ible of his own in&s;olence, and their enmity, was unwilling to tru&s;t him&s;elf into their power, but &s;hut him&s;elf up in the Tower of London. From thence he fled, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a female habit, beyond &s;ea; upon which the archbi&s;hop of Rouen was made ju&s;ticiary in his room. The&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions were &s;oon known by the king of France, who was by this time returned from the Holy Land. He made all po&s;|&s;ible u&s;e of Longchamp's re&s;entment to divide the Engli&s;h &s;till more effectually; and even had almo&s;t prevailed upon John, to throw off his allegiance, by an offer of putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all Richard's continental domi|nions.</P>
<P>It was in this precarious &s;ituation of af|fairs, that the Engli&s;h were fir&s;t informed of the captivity of their beloved monarch, and the ba&s;e treatment he had received, without even the colour of ju&s;tice to glo&s;s over the injury. The Queen Dowager was particularly enraged at the treatment of her favourite &s;on. She wrote reiterated letters to Pope Cele&s;tine, to ex|cite his compa&s;&s;ion, or his indignation; but all
<PB N="289" REF="299">
to very little purpo&s;e. The people te&s;tified their regard for him with all the marks of violence and de&s;pair. The clergy con&s;idered him as a &s;ufferer in the cau&s;e of the church; and all mouths were filled with the noblene&s;s of his actions, and the greatne&s;s of his fall. But while the&s;e te&s;tified the &s;incerity of their &s;orrow, there were &s;ome that &s;ecretly rejoiced in his di&s;a&s;ter, and did all they could to prolong the term of his captivity. Of this number was the king of France, his ancient enemy, and his own bro|ther John, who, forgetting every tie of kin|dred, duty, or gratitude, on the fir&s;t invitation from Philip &s;uddenly went abroad, and held a conference with him, in which the perpetual captivity of Richard was agreed upon. He &s;tipu|lated to deliver into Philip's hands a great part of Normandy; and in return, he received the French king's a&s;&s;urances of being &s;ecured on the Engli&s;h throne; and &s;ome &s;ay that he did ho|mage for the crown of England. In con&s;e|quence of this treaty, Philip invaded Norman|dy, the fortre&s;&s;es of which were delivered up to him after a colour of oppo&s;ition; and all but Rouen were &s;ubjected to his authority. John, on his &s;ide, was equally a&s;&s;iduous to &s;ecure Eng|land; and, upon his arrival in London, claim|ed the throne, as being heir to his brother, of
<PB N="290" REF="300">
who&s;e death he pretended to have received cer|tain intelligence. But in this the traitor's ex|pectations were di&s;appointed. His claim was rejected by all the barons, who took &s;uch mea|&s;ures to provide for the &s;ecurity of the king|dom, that John was obliged to return to the continent, and openly to acknowledge his al|liance with the king of France.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the unhappy Richard &s;uf|fered all the mortifications that malicious ty|ranny could inflict. The emperor, in order to ren|der him more impatient for the recovery of his li|berty, and make him &s;ubmit to the payment of a larger ran&s;om, treated him with the greate&s;t &s;eve|rity, and reduced him to a condition wor&s;e than that of the meane&s;t malefactor. Richard, however, was too noble-&s;pirited to be meanly depre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e indignities. As he did not know what extremities he might be reduced to, or what conde&s;cen&s;ions he might be obliged to make, he wrote to the ju&s;ticiary of England to obey no orders that &s;hould come from him, if they &s;eemed in the lea&s;t contrary to his honour, or the good of the nation. His precautions were well founded; for the emperor, willing to intimidate him, had him even accu&s;ed at the diet of Worms of many crimes and mi&s;demean|nors, partly to ju&s;tify his own cruelty, and
<PB N="291" REF="301">
partly to &s;well the ran&s;om. There he was charged with making an alliance with Tan|cred, the u&s;urper of Sicily; of turning the arms of the cru&s;ade again&s;t a chri&s;tian prince; of af|fronting the duke of Au&s;tria before Acres; of ob&s;tructing the progre&s;s of the chri&s;tian arms, by his conte&s;ts with the king of France; of con|cluding a truce with Saladin, and leaving Jeru|&s;alem in the hands of the infidels. The&s;e frivolous charges were heard by Richard with becoming indignation. He even waved his dignity to an&s;wer them; and &s;o fully vindicated him&s;elf before the princes who compo&s;ed the diet, that they exclaimed loudly again&s;t the conduct of the emperor, while the pope even threatened him with excommunication. This barbarous monarch now &s;aw that he could no longer de|tain his pri&s;oner. He therefore was willing to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation. A ran&s;om was agreed upon, which amounted to an hundred and fifty thou&s;and marks, or about three hun|dred thou&s;and pounds of our money. Of this, Richard was to pay one hundred thou&s;and, before he received his liberty; and &s;ixty-&s;even ho&s;tages were to be delivered for the remain|der. The agreement being thus made, Ri|chard &s;ent Hubert, one of his faithful follow|ers in the Holy Land, to England, with the
<PB N="292" REF="302">
terms upon which he was to receive his liberty, and with a commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e money for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the feudal times, every military tenant was, by law, obliged to give aid for the ran&s;om of his lord from captivity. The tax ari&s;ing from this obligation was accordingly rai&s;ed through|out the kingdom, and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by itinerant ju&s;|tices. But the ardour of the people out-went the cool offerings of their duty; great &s;ums were rai&s;ed by voluntary contribution, to purcha&s;e the freedom of their king. The churches and mona&s;teries melted down their plate; the bi&s;hops, abbots, and nobles, paid a fourth of their annual income; the inferior clergy contributed a tenth of their tythes, and the requi&s;ite &s;um was thus at length ama&s;&s;ed; with which queen Eleanor, and the ju&s;ticiary immediately &s;et out for Germany.</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;h were thus piou&s;ly em|ployed, in preparing for the ran&s;om of their king, Philip was as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly occupied in endeavouring to prolong Richard's captivity. As he had the pa&s;&s;ions of the emperor to work upon, whom he knew to be avaricious to the la&s;t degree, he made him fre&s;h propo&s;als &s;till more lucrative than tho&s;e which had been agreed upon for Richard's ran&s;om. He offer|ed
<PB N="239" REF="303">
to marry the emperor's daughter, and to gra|tify him with a &s;um equal to the ran&s;om, if he would only detain his pri&s;oner for one year more in captivity. The emperor therefore per|ceived, that he had concluded a treaty with Ri|chard too ha&s;tily, and repented of his ra&s;hne&s;s. He was very willing to &s;acrifice every con&s;ide|ration of honour or ju&s;tice; but then he feared the re&s;entment of his princes, who, in the&s;e feudal times, had power to puni&s;h his inju&s;tice. Thus he continued fluctuating between his ava|rice and his fears, between different motives, equally &s;ordid, until the day fixed for the king's deliverance arrived. His relea&s;ement from cap|tivity was performed with great ceremony at Mentz, in pre&s;ence of the German nobility; the money was paid by queen Eleanor, the ho&s;tages were delivered as a &s;ecurity for the remainder, and Richard once more re&s;tored to freedom. In the mean time, the emperor beheld his relea&s;ement with an agitation of all the malignant pa&s;&s;ions. He could not bear to &s;ee one he had made his enemy in a &s;tate of felicity; he could not bear to lo&s;e the &s;uperior advantages that were of|fered for his detention. All his terrors, from his own &s;ubjects, gave way to the &s;uperior dictates of avarice; he therefore once more re&s;olved to &s;end him back to his former pri&s;on, and
<PB N="294" REF="304">
gave orders to have him pur&s;ued and arre&s;ted. But luckily, the me&s;&s;engers were too late. Ri|chard, well acquainted with his perfidy, and &s;e|cretly apprized of the offers of the French king, had ordered &s;ome &s;hipping to attend him at the mouth of the Scheld; &s;o that upon his arrival at the place of embarking, he went in&s;tantly on board, although the wind was again&s;t him, and was out of &s;ight of land when his pur&s;uers reached Antwerp.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the joy of the Eng|li&s;h, upon &s;eeing their monarch return, after all his atchievements and &s;ufferings. He made his entry into London in triumph; and &s;uch was the profu&s;ion of wealth &s;hewn by the ci|tizens, that the German lords, who attended him, were heard to &s;ay, that if the emperor had known of their affluence, he would not &s;o ea&s;ily have parted with their king. He, &s;oon after, ordered him&s;elf to be crowned a-new at Winche&s;ter. He convoked a general council at Nottingham, at which he confi&s;cated all his traiterous brother's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and then hav|ing made proper preparations for avenging him&s;elf on the king of France, he &s;et &s;ail with a &s;trong body of forces for Normandy.</P>
<P>Richard was but one day landed, when his faithle&s;s brother John came to make &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="295" REF="305">
and to throw him&s;elf at his monarch's feet. It was not without &s;ome degree of re&s;entment,<MILESTONE N="1194" UNIT="A.D."> that Richard received a prince, who had all along been leagued with his mortal enemy again&s;t him. However, at the interce&s;&s;ion of queen Eleanor, he was received into favour. <Q REND="inline">"I forgive him," &s;aid the king; "and I wi&s;h I could as ea&s;ily forget his offences as he will forget my pardon."</Q> This conde&s;cen&s;ion was not lo&s;t upon a man, who&s;e heart, though naturally bad, was not yet dead to every &s;entiment of humanity. From that time he &s;erved him faithfully; and did him &s;ignal &s;ervices in his battles with the king of France, which follow|ed &s;oon after. The&s;e wars, which produced no remarkable event, nor were &s;ucceeded by any permanent con&s;equences, only &s;erved to keep the animo&s;ity of the two nations alive,<MILESTONE N="1195" UNIT="A.D."> without fixing their claims or preten&s;ions. The mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance, in the te|dious journals of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, is the tak|ing the bi&s;hop of Beauvais captive at the head of his va&s;&s;als, and his being put in pri&s;on by Ri|chard. When the pope demanded his liberty, and claimed him as a child of the church, the king &s;ent his holine&s;s the bloody coat of mail, which that prelate had worn in battle; a&s;king whether that was the coat of his &s;on. The
<PB N="296" REF="306">
cruelty of both parties was in this manner en|flamed by in&s;ult and revenge. Both kings frequently put out the eyes of their pri&s;oners, and treaties were concluded and broke with very little repugnance. At length, the pope's le|gate induced them to commence a treaty, which promi&s;ed to be attended with a firmer reconciliation; but the death of Richard put an end to the conte&s;t.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1199" UNIT="A.D."> Aymar, vi&s;count of Limoges, a va&s;&s;al of the crown, had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a trea&s;ure, which was found by one of his pea&s;ants in digging a field; and to &s;ecure the remainder, he &s;ent a part of it to the king. Richard, as &s;u|perior lord, &s;en&s;ible that he had a right to the whole, in&s;i&s;ted on its being &s;ent him; and, up|on refu&s;al, attacked the ca&s;tle of Chalus, where he under&s;tood this trea&s;ure had been depo&s;ited. On the fourth day of the &s;iege, as he was riding round the place to ob&s;erve where the a&s;&s;ault might be given with the faire&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s, he was aimed at by one Bertram de Jour|don, an archer from the ca&s;tle, and pierced in the &s;houlder with an arrow. The wound was not in it&s;elf dangerous; but an un&s;kilful &s;ur|geon endeavouring to di&s;engage the arrow from the fle&s;h, &s;o rankled the wound that it mortified, and brought on fatal &s;ymptoms.
<PB N="297" REF="307">
Richard, when he found his end approaching, made a will, in which he bequeathed the king|dom, with all his trea&s;ure, to his brother John, except a fourth part which he di&s;tributed a|mong his &s;ervants. He ordered al&s;o, that the archer who had &s;hot him, &s;hould be brought into his pre&s;ence, and demanded what injury he had done him that he &s;hould take away his life? The pri&s;oner an&s;wered with deliberate in|trepidity: <Q REND="inline">"You killed, with your own hands, my father, and my two brothers; and you in|tended to have hanged me. I am now in your power, and my torments may give you revenge; but I will endure them with plea|&s;ure, &s;ince it is my con&s;olation, that I have rid the world of a tyrant."</Q> Richard, &s;truck with this an&s;wer, ordered the &s;oldier to be pre&s;ented with one hundred &s;hillings, and &s;et at liberty; but Marcade the general who com|manded under him, like a true ruffian, or|dered him to be flead alive, and then hanged. Richard died in the tenth year of his reign, and the forty-&s;econd of his age, leaving only one natural &s;on, called Philip, behind him.</P>
<P>Richard had all the qualities that could gain the admiration and love of a barbarous age, and few of tho&s;e that could en&s;ure the ap|probation of his more refined po&s;terity. He
<PB N="298" REF="308">
was open, magnanimous, generous, and brave, to a degree of romantic exce&s;s. But then he was cruel, proud, and re&s;entful. He valued neither the blood, nor the trea&s;ure of his &s;ub|jects; and he enfeebled his &s;tates by u&s;ele&s;s expeditions, and wars calculated rather to pro|mote his own revenge than their intere&s;ts. Du|ring this reign, the inferior orders of the people &s;eemed to encrea&s;e in power, and to &s;hew a degree of independent ob&s;tinacy. Formerly, they were led on to acts of trea&s;on by their ba|rons; they were now found to aim at vindicating their rights, under a leader of their own rank and denomination. The populace of London placed at their head one William Fitzo&s;bern, commonly called Longbeard, who had been bred to the law; but who fonder of popula|rity than bu&s;ine&s;s, renounced his profe&s;&s;ion, and e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the poor with un|common enthu&s;ia&s;m. He &s;tiled him&s;elf the &s;aviour of the poor; and upon a certain oc|ca&s;ion even went over to Normandy, where he repre&s;ented to the king, that the poorer citi|zens were oppre&s;&s;ed by an unequal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of taxes, and obtained a mitigation. His fame for this became &s;o great among the lower orders of his fellow-citizens, that above fifty thou&s;and of them entered into an engage|ment
<PB N="299" REF="309">
to defend, and to obey him. Murders were in con&s;equence daily committed in the &s;treets; but whether by Longbeard's order is uncertain. The ju&s;ticiary (for the king was then ab&s;ent) &s;ummoned him before the coun|cil to an&s;wer for his conduct; but he came with &s;uch a formidable train, that none were found hardy enough to accu&s;e him. How|ever, he was pur&s;ued &s;ome time after by a de|tachment of officers of ju&s;tice; but killing one of them, he e&s;caped with his concubine to the church of St. Mary Le Bow, where he de|fended him&s;elf with determined re&s;olution. There he was &s;upplied with arms and provi|&s;ions, and expected to be joined by the popu|lace; but being deceived in his expectations, he was at la&s;t forced from his retreat by the &s;moke of wet &s;traw kindled for the purpo&s;e at the door. He was then taken, tried, and convicted; and being drawn at an hor&s;e's tail through the &s;treets of London, he was hung in chains, with nine more of his accomplices. The lower cla&s;s of people when he was dead, began to revere a man that they had not &s;pirit to relieve. They &s;tole his gibbet, and paid it a veneration like that offered to the wood of the cro&s;s. The turf on which it &s;tood was carried away, and kept as a pre&s;ervative from &s;ickne&s;s and mis|fortune;

and had not the clergy with&s;tood the torrent of popular &s;uper&s;tition, his memory might have probably received honours &s;imilar to tho&s;e paid at the &s;hrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury.</P>

<P>WERE the claims of princes &s;ettled on the &s;ame principles that govern the lower or|ders of mankind, John had nothing to fear from a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The king of France, who was the only monarch that could a&s;&s;i&s;t the preten&s;ions of a rival, had long de|clared for John's title; and during the life of his brother, had given him the mo&s;t convinc|ing
<PB N="302" REF="312">
proofs of &s;incerity in his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But it was otherwi&s;e, now that Richard was no more. Philip began to &s;hew, that his for|mer alliances and friend&s;hips were calculated not to &s;erve John, but to di&s;tre&s;s England; not to di&s;tribute ju&s;tice, but to encrea&s;e his own power. There was an old claimant of the crown, whom indeed Richard, upon his taking the cro&s;s, declared heir to the throne; but who was afterwards &s;et a&s;ide, at the in&s;tance of the dowager-queen. This was Arthur, the &s;on of his late brother Geoffry, a youth, who, though then but twelve years of age, promi&s;ed to be de&s;erving of the kingdom. Philip, who only de&s;ired an occa&s;ion to embarra&s;s John, &s;oon re|&s;olved to &s;econd this young claimant's preten|&s;ions; and &s;everal of the continental barons immediately declared in favour of Arthur's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>John, who was readily put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h throne, lo&s;t no time to &s;econd his intere&s;t on the continent; and his fir&s;t care was to recover the revolted provinces from young Arthur, his nephew. The war, therefore, be|tween the Engli&s;h and French king was re|newed with all its former animo&s;ity, and all its u&s;ual detail of petty victories, and undeci&s;ive engagements. At length, a treaty put an end
<PB N="303" REF="313">
to tho&s;e conte&s;ts that only &s;erved to thin man|kind, and it was ha&s;tened by a circum&s;tance peculiarly favourable. John's nephew, Ar|thur, together with Con&s;tantia, his mother, di&s;tru&s;ting the de&s;igns of the king of France, who only intended to betray them, came to throw them&s;elves on his mercy, and re&s;tored the provinces which &s;till continued in their in|tere&s;t. Thus this monarch, after a &s;hort con|te&s;t, &s;aw him&s;elf undi&s;puted monarch of all the dominions which were annexed to the Eng|li&s;h throne. But he was ill able to pre&s;erve that power by his prudence, which was thus ea&s;ily obtained by the mutual jealou&s;ies of his enemies. His fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was his mar|riage with I&s;abella, the daughter of count An|gouleme, while the queen was yet alive; <MILESTONE N="1220" UNIT="A.D."> and what &s;till encrea&s;ed the offence, while I&s;abella properly belonged to another hu&s;band, the count de la Marche, who ardently loved her. This produced an in&s;urrection again&s;t him; to repre&s;s which, he was obliged to have recour&s;e to his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by who&s;e means the confederacy was &s;oon broken; and John found, by his pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s, that he might future commit violences with impu|nity.</P>
<P>As the method of deciding all di&s;putes by
<PB N="304" REF="314">
duel was &s;till in full force, John re&s;olved to avail him&s;elf of this advantage again&s;t all his refractory barons. He kept a &s;et of hired bra|voes, under the title of his champions; and the&s;e he deputed to fight his cau&s;e whenever any of the nobility oppo&s;ed his encroachments. Such contemptible opponents very ju&s;tly gave the haughty barons di&s;gu&s;t, and an univer&s;al di&s;content prevailed among&s;t them, which at la&s;t produced another dangerous confederacy. John attempted to break it by oaths, prote&s;ta|tions, and perfidies; but every attempt of this kind only &s;erved to connect his enemies, and render his per&s;on contemptible.</P>
<P>Something &s;till remained to render John hateful to his &s;ubjects; and this ill di&s;po&s;ed prince took the fir&s;t opportunity of becoming &s;o. Young Arthur, who, with his mother, had &s;o imprudently re&s;igned them&s;elves to his protection, &s;oon perceived their error, and found that nothing honourable was to be expect|ed from a prince of his abandoned character. Ob&s;erving &s;omewhat very &s;u&s;picious in his man|ner of conducting him&s;elf to them, they fled from Mans, where he detained them, and re|tired in the night to Angers, from whence they went once more to take refuge with their old protector. As it was Philip's intere&s;t to
<PB N="305" REF="315">
treat them with all po&s;&s;ible indulgence, they were received with great marks of di&s;tinction; and young Arthur's intere&s;ts were &s;oon after very vigorou&s;ly &s;upported. One town after another &s;ubmitted to his authority; and all his attempts &s;eemed attended with &s;ucce&s;s. But his unfortunate ardour &s;oon put an end to his hopes and his claims. Being of an enterpriz|ing di&s;po&s;ition, and fond of military glory, he had laid &s;iege to a fortre&s;s in which the dow|ager-queen was protected; and defended by a weak garri&s;on. John therefore falling upon his little army, before they were aware of his ap|proach, the young prince was taken pri&s;oner, to|gether with the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the re|volted barons. The greater part of the pri|&s;oners were &s;ent over to England; but the un|fortunate prince him&s;elf was &s;hut up in the ca&s;tle of Falai&s;e. John thus finding a rival at his mercy, from whom he had every thing to dread, began to meditate upon mea&s;ures which would mo&s;t effectually remove his fu|ture apprehen&s;ions. No other expedient &s;ug|ge&s;ted it&s;elf, but what is foremo&s;t in the ima|gination of tyrants, namely, the young prince's death. How this brave youth was di&s;patched is not well known: certain it is, that from the moment of his confinement he was never
<PB N="306" REF="316">
heard of more. The mo&s;t probable account of this horrid tran&s;action is as follows. The king having fir&s;t propo&s;ed to one of his &s;er|vants, William de la Braye, to di&s;patch Ar|thur, this brave dome&s;tic replied, that he was a gentleman, and not an executioner. This of|ficer having po&s;itively refu&s;ed to comply, John had recour&s;e to another in&s;trument, who went with proper directions, to the ca&s;tle where Ar|thur was confined to de&s;troy him. But &s;till this prince's fate &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended; for Hu|bert de Bourg, chamberlain to the king, and con&s;table of the place, willing to &s;ave him, un|dertook the cruel office him&s;elf, and &s;ent back the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to his employer. However, he was &s;oon obliged to confe&s;s the impo&s;ture; for Ar|thur's &s;ubjects vowing the &s;evere&s;t revenge, Hubert, to appea&s;e them, revealed the &s;ecret of his pretended death, and a&s;&s;ured them, that their prince was &s;till alive, and in his cu&s;tody. John now finding that all his emi&s;&s;aries had &s;till more compunction than him&s;elf, re&s;olved, with his own hands, to execute this bloody deed; and for that purpo&s;e had Arthur re|moved to the ca&s;tle of Rouen, &s;ituated upon the river Seine. It was at midnight when John came in a boat to the place, and ordered the young prince to be brought before him. Long
<PB N="307" REF="317">
confinement, &s;olitude, and the continuance of bad fortune, had now broken this generous youth's &s;pirit; and perceiving that his death was meditated, he threw him&s;elf in the mo&s;t im|ploring manner upon his knees before his un|cle, and begged for mercy. John was too much hardened in the &s;chool of tyranny, to feel any pity for his wretched &s;uppliant. His youth, his affinity, his merits, were all di&s;|regarded, or were even obnoxious in a rival. The barbarous tyrant making no reply, &s;tab|bed him with his own hands; and fa&s;tening a &s;tone to the dead body, threw it into the Seine. This inhuman action thus rid John of an hated rival; but happily, for the in&s;truction of future princes, it opened the way to his fu|ture ruin. Having in this manner &s;hewn him|&s;elf the enemy of mankind, in the pro&s;perity of his reign, the whole world &s;eemed to turn their back upon him in his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>John was now dete&s;ted by all mankind, and the re&s;t of his reign he only &s;upported him&s;elf in power, by making it the intere&s;t of &s;ome to protect him, and letting others feel the effects of his re&s;entment, if they offered to offend. The lo&s;s of all his French provinces immediately followed his la&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Not but that he attempted a defence; and even laid &s;iege to
<PB N="308" REF="318">
Alen&ccedil;on, one of the towns that had revolted from him. But Philip, his active rival, per|&s;uaded a body of knights, who were a&s;&s;embled at a tournament, to take his part; and the&s;e rea|dily joining again&s;t the parricide, quickly oblig|ed him to rai&s;e the &s;iege. John, therefore, re|pul&s;ed, and &s;tript of his dominions, was ob|liged to bear the in&s;ult with patience; though, indeed, &s;uch was the ridiculous ab&s;urdity of his pride, that he a&s;&s;ured tho&s;e about him of his being able to take back in a day, what co&s;t the French years in acquiring.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1205" UNIT="A.D."> Normandy &s;oon followed the fate of the French provinces. Chateau Gaillard, one of its &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es, being taken after an ob|&s;tinate &s;iege, the whole duchy lay open to the invader; and while John ba&s;ely &s;ought &s;afety by flying into England, Philip, &s;ecure of his prey, pu&s;hed his conque&s;ts with vigour. The whole duchy &s;ubmitted to his authority; and thus, after being for near three centuries di&s;membered from the French monarchy, was again reunited.</P>
<P>John being thus &s;tript of all his continental dominions, was re&s;olved to wreak his vengeance on that part of the monarchy which &s;till acknow|ledged &s;ubjection. Upon his arrival therefore in England, he began to lay the blame of his ill
<PB N="309" REF="319">
&s;ucce&s;s upon his barons, who he pretended had de&s;erted his &s;tandard in Normandy. To puni&s;h them for this imputed offence, he le|vied large &s;ums upon their e&s;tates and effects, under colour of preparations for a Norman expedition; which, however, he deferred till the next year. When the &s;ea&s;on came for making it, he &s;ummoned all his barons to attend him; and then capriciou&s;ly deferred the execution of his projects to another opportu|nity. The year following he put to &s;ea, as if with a firm re&s;olution to do wonders; but re|turned &s;oon after, without making the &s;malle&s;t attempt. Another year elap&s;ed, when he pro|mi&s;ed that he would then redeem his country's reputation by a mo&s;t &s;ignal blow. He &s;et &s;ail, landed at Rochelle, marched to Angers, laid the city in a&s;hes; and hearing that the enemy were preparing to oppo&s;e him, he reimbarked his troops, and returned once more to his indig|nant country, loaden with &s;hame and con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Hitherto John was rather hateful to his &s;ub|jects than contemptible; they rather dreaded than de&s;pi&s;ed him. But he &s;oon &s;hewed that he might be offended, if not without re&s;entment at lea&s;t with impunity. It was the fate of this vi|tious prince to make tho&s;e the enemies of him|&s;elf
<PB N="310" REF="320">
whom he wanted abilities to make the ene|mies of each other. The clergy had for &s;ome time acted as a community independent on the crown, and had their elections of each other generally confirmed by the pope, to whom alone they owned &s;ubjection. However, the election of archbi&s;hops had for &s;ome time been a continual &s;ubject of di&s;pute between the &s;uf|fragan bi&s;hops, and the Augu&s;tine monks, and both had precedents to confirm their preten|&s;ions. Things being in this &s;ituation, Hubert the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, died; and the Augu&s;tine monks, in a very private manner, made choice of Reginald, their &s;ub-prior. The bi&s;hops exclaimed at this election, as a mani|fe&s;t inva&s;ion of their privileges; and a furious theological conte&s;t was likely to en&s;ue. A po|litic prince would have &s;eized &s;uch a conjunc|ture with joy; and would have managed the quarrel in &s;uch a manner as to enfeeble the ex|orbitant power of the clergy, by enflaming their mutual animo&s;ity. But John was not a politic prince. He immediately &s;ided with the &s;uffragan bi&s;hops; and John de Gray, bi&s;hop of Norwich, was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en. To decide the mutual claims of both parties, it was expedient to appeal to the &s;ee of Rome; an agent was &s;ent by the bi&s;hops to maintain their
<PB N="311" REF="321">
cau&s;e, while the monks di&s;patched twelve of their order to &s;upport their preten&s;ions. Inno|cent III. who then filled the chair, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unbounded &s;hare of power, and his talents were equal to the veneration in which he was held. He &s;eized with avidity that conjuncture which John failed to u&s;e; and vacating the claims of both parties, as uncanonical and illegal, he enjoined the monks to chu&s;e Cardinal Stephen Langton, an Engli&s;hman, then at the court of Rome, as a fit per&s;on to fill the vacant dignity.</P>
<P>This was an encroachment of power that the &s;ee of Rome had long been aiming at, and that it was now re&s;olved to maintain. The being able to nominate to the greate&s;t dignity in the kingdom, next that of the king, was an acqui&s;i|tion that would effectually give the court of Rome an authority, which it had hitherto vainly pretended to a&s;&s;ume. So great an in&s;ult was to be introduced to this weak prince with per&s;ua|&s;ions adapted to his capacity; and the pope ac|cordingly &s;ent him a mo&s;t affectionate letter, with a pre&s;ent of four gold rings, &s;et with precious &s;tones. He begged John to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the form of the rings, their number, their mat|ter, and their colour. Their form being round, &s;hadowed out eternity, for which it was his duty to prepare. Their number four, denoted
<PB N="312" REF="322">
the four cardinal virtues, which it was his du|ty to practi&s;e. Their matter being gold, the mo&s;t precious of metals, denoted wi&s;dom, the mo&s;t precious of accompli&s;hments, which it was his duty to acquire; and as to their colour, the green colour of the emerald repre&s;ented faith; the yellow of the &s;aphire, hope; the redne&s;s of the ruby, charity; and the &s;plendor of the topaz, good works. John received the rings, thought all the pope's illu&s;trations very beauti|ful; but was re&s;olved not to admit Stephen Langton as archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P>As all John's mea&s;ures were conducted with violence, he &s;ent two knights of his train, who were fit in&s;truments for &s;uch a prince, to ex|pel the monks from their convent, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their revenues. The pope was not di&s;plea&s;ed at this in&s;tance of his impetuo&s;i|ty; he was &s;en&s;ible that John would &s;ink in the conte&s;t, and therefore per&s;evered the more vigorou&s;ly in his preten&s;ions. He began his attempts to carry his mea&s;ures by &s;oothing, im|ploring, and urging; he proceeded to threats, and at la&s;t &s;ent three Engli&s;h prelates to the king to inform him, that if he per&s;evered in his di&s;obedience, he would put the kingdom un|der the &s;entence of an interdict. All the other prelates threw them&s;elves on their knees before
<PB N="313" REF="323">
the king; entreated him in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner not to bring upon them the re&s;ent|ment of the holy tribunal; exhorted him to receive the new elected primate, and to re&s;tore the monks to their convent, from whence they had been expelled. But the&s;e entreaties &s;erved only to enflame his re&s;entment. He broke out into the mo&s;t violent invectives; and &s;wore by God's teeth, his u&s;ual oath, that if the king|dom was put under an interdict, he would ba|ni&s;h the whole body of the clergy, and confi&s;|cate all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. This idle threat only &s;erved to ha&s;ten the re&s;entment of the pontiff. Perceiving the king's weakne&s;s, and how little he was loved by his &s;ubjects, he i&s;&s;ued at la&s;t the &s;entence of the interdict, which was &s;o much dreaded by the whole nation. This in|&s;trument of terror in the hands of the &s;ee of Rome, was calculated to &s;trike the &s;en&s;es in the highe&s;t degree, and to operate upon the &s;u|per&s;titious minds of the people. By it a &s;top was immediately put to divine &s;ervice, and to the admini&s;tration of all the &s;acraments but bap|ti&s;m. The church doors were &s;hut, the &s;tatues of the &s;aints were laid on the ground. The dead were refu&s;ed chri&s;tian burial, and were thrown into ditches and on the highways, with|out the u&s;ual rites, or any funeral &s;olemnity.

Marriage was celebrated in the church-yards, and the people prohibited the u&s;e of meat, as in times of public penance. They were de|barred from all plea&s;ure; they were prohibited from &s;having their beards, from &s;aluting each other, and giving any attention to their appa|rel. Every circum&s;tance &s;eemed calculated to in&s;pire religious terror; and te&s;tified the appre|hen&s;ions of divine vengeance and indignation. Again&s;t &s;uch a calamity, encrea&s;ed by the deplor|able lamentations of the clergy, it was in vain that John exerted all his authority, threatened, and puni&s;hed, and oppo&s;ed the terrors of his tempo|ral power to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures. It was in vain that he bani&s;hed &s;ome, and confined others; it was in vain that he treated the adherents of Langton with rigour, and ordered all the con|cubines of the clergy to be impri&s;oned. The church conquered by per&s;everance; and John &s;aw him&s;elf every day growing more obnoxious and more contemptible. The barons, many of who&s;e families he had di&s;honoured by his li|centious amours, were almo&s;t to a man his de|clared enemies. The clergy repre&s;ented him in the mo&s;t odious light to the people; and nothing remained to him but the feeble re|lics of that power, which had been &s;o &s;trongly fixed by his grandfather, that all his vices were hitherto unable totally to overthrow.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="325">In the mean time, the pope &s;eeing all the con&s;equences he expected attending the inter|dict; and that the king, was thus rendered per|fectly di&s;agreeable to his &s;ubjects, re&s;olved to &s;e|cond his blow; and while the people were yet impre&s;&s;ed with terror, determined to take ad|vantage of their con&s;ternation. The church of Rome had artificially contrived a gradation of &s;entences; by which, while &s;he inflicted one puni&s;hment, &s;he taught the &s;ufferers to expect more formidable con&s;equences from that which were to en&s;ue. On the back of the interdict therefore, came the &s;entence of excommuni|cation, by which John was at once rendered impious, and unfit for human &s;ociety.<MILESTONE N="1209" UNIT="A.D."> No &s;ooner was this terrible &s;entence denounced again&s;t him, than his &s;ubjects began to think of oppo&s;ing his authority. The clergy were the fir&s;t to &s;et an example of di&s;obe|dience. Geoffry, archdeacon of Norwich, who was entru&s;ted with a con&s;iderable office in the court of Exchequer, re&s;igned his em|ployment, which &s;o exa&s;perated the king that he had him confined; and ordering his head to be covered with a great leaden cope, thus kept him in torment till he died. Mo&s;t of the other bi&s;hops dreading his fate, left the kingdom. Many of the nobility al&s;o, ter|rified
<PB N="316" REF="326">
at the king's tyranny, went into vo|luntary exile, and tho&s;e who remained, only employed their time in cementing a confe|deracy again&s;t him. The next gradation of papal indignation, was to ab&s;olve John's &s;ubjects from their oaths of fidelity and allegiance; and to declare every one excom|municated who had any commerce with him in public or private; at his table, in his coun|cil, or even in private conver&s;ation. John, however, &s;till continued refractory; and only one &s;tep more remained for the pope to take, and this was to give away the kingdom to an|other.</P>
<P>No &s;ituation could be more deplorable than that of John upon this occa&s;ion. Furious at his indignities, jealous of his &s;ubjects, and apprehending an enemy in every face; it is &s;aid, that fearing a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life, he &s;hut him&s;elf up a whole night in the ca&s;tle of Nottingham, and &s;uffered none to approach his per&s;on. Being informed that the king of Wales had taken part again&s;t him, he ordered all the Wel&s;h ho&s;tages to be in&s;tantly put to death. Being apprehen&s;ive of the fidelity of his barons, he required their &s;ons and daughters as ho&s;tages for their obedience. When his of|ficers repaired on this odious duty to the ca&s;tle
<PB N="317" REF="327">
of William Brau&s;e, a nobleman of great note, that baron's wife re&s;olutely told them, that &s;he would never tru&s;t her children in the hands of a man, who had &s;o barbarou&s;ly murdered his own nephew. John was &s;o provoked at this merited reproach, that he &s;ent a body of forces to &s;eize the per&s;on of Brau&s;e, who fled into Ireland with his wife and family. But John's indignation pur&s;ued them there; and di&s;cover|ing the unhappy family in their retreat, he &s;eiz|ed the wife and &s;on, whom he &s;tarved to death in pri&s;on, while the unfortunate father narrowly e&s;caped by flying into France.</P>
<P>Mean while the pope, who had re&s;olved on giving the kingdom to another, was employed in fixing upon a per&s;on, who was willing to accept the donation, and had power to vindi|cate his claim. Philip, the king of France, &s;eemed of all others the fitte&s;t of &s;uch an un|dertaking; he was politic and powerful, he had already de&s;poiled John of his continental dominions, and was the mo&s;t likely per&s;on to deprive him of the remainder. To him, there|fore, the pope made a tender of the kingdom of England; and Philip very ardently em|braced the offer. To &s;trengthen the hands of Philip &s;till more, the pope publi&s;hed a cru&s;ade again&s;t the depo&s;ed monarch all over Europe;
<PB N="318" REF="328">
exhorting the nobility, the knights, and men of every condition, to take up arms again&s;t that per&s;ecutor of the church, and to enli&s;t under the French banner. Philip was not le&s;s active on his part; he levied a great army, and &s;um|moning all the va&s;&s;als of the crown to attend him at Rouen, he collected a fleet of &s;eventeen hundred ve&s;&s;els in the &s;ea-ports of Normandy and Picardy,<MILESTONE N="1213" UNIT="A.D."> already devouring in imagina|tion the kingdom he was appointed to po&s;|&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>John, who, un&s;ettled and apprehen&s;ive, &s;carcely knew where to turn, was &s;till able to make an expiring effort to receive the ene|my. All hated as he was, the natural enmity between the French and the Engli&s;h, the name of king which he &s;till retained, and &s;ome re|maining power, put him at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, a &s;ufficient number indeed, but not to be relied on, and with the&s;e he advan|ced to Dover. Europe now regarded the im|portant preparations on both &s;ides with im|patience; and the deci&s;ive blow was &s;oon ex|pected, in which the church was to triumph, or to be overthrown. But neither Philip nor John had ability equal to the pontiff by whom they were actuated; he appeared on this occa|&s;ion too refined a politician for either. He
<PB N="319" REF="329">
only intended to make u&s;e of Philip's power to intimidate his refractory &s;on, not to de&s;troy him. He expected more advantages from his agreement with a prince, &s;o abject both in character and fortune, than from his alliance with a great and victorious monarch; who, having nothing el&s;e left to conquer, might convert his power again&s;t his benefactor. He therefore, &s;ecretly commi&s;&s;ioned Pandolf his legate, to admit of John's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be offered, and he dictated the terms which would be proper for him to impo&s;e. In con&s;equence of this, the legate pa&s;&s;ed through France, where he beheld Philip's great arma|ment ready to &s;et &s;ail, and highly commended that monarch's zeal and expedition. From thence he went in per&s;on; or as &s;ome &s;ay, &s;ent over an envoy, to Dover, under pretence of negociat|ing with the barons, and had a conference with John upon his arrival. He there repre&s;ented to this forlorn prince, the numbers of the ene|my, the hatred of his own &s;ubjects, and the &s;ecret confederacy there was in England again&s;t him. He intimated, that there was but one way to &s;ecure him&s;elf from impending danger; which was, to put him&s;elf under the pope's protection, who was a merciful father, and &s;till willing to receive a repentent &s;inner to
<PB N="320" REF="330">
his bo&s;om. John was too much intimidat|ed, by the manife&s;t danger of his &s;ituation, not to embrace every means offered for his &s;afety. He a&s;&s;ented to the truth of the le|gate's remon&s;trances, and took an oath to per|form whatever &s;tipulations the pope &s;hould impo&s;e. Having thus &s;worn to the perform|ance of an unknown command, the artful Italian &s;o well managed the barons, and &s;o effectually intimidated the king, that he per|&s;uaded him to take the mo&s;t extraordinary oath in all the records of hi&s;tory, before all the people, kneeling upon his knees, and with his hands held up between tho&s;e of the legate.</P>

<P>Thus, after all his armaments and expecta|tions, Philip &s;aw him&s;elf di&s;appointed of his prey, and perceived that the pope had over|reached him in this tran&s;action. Neverthele&s;s, as he had undertaken the expedition at the pope's reque&s;t, he was re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the war, in oppo&s;ition to him and all his cen&s;ures. He laid before his va&s;&s;als the ill treatment he had received from the court of Rome; and they all vowed to &s;econd his enterprize, except the earl of Flanders, who declared again&s;t the impiety of the undertaking. In the mean time, while the French king was re&s;olving to bring this refractory nobleman to his duty, the Eng|li&s;h admiral attacked the French fleet in their harbours, where he took three hundred &s;hips, and de&s;troyed an hundred more. Philip find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the re&s;t from fall|ing into the hands of the enemy, &s;et fire to them him&s;elf, and was thus obliged to give up all de&s;igns upon England.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="332"><MILESTONE N="1213" UNIT="A.D."> John was now once more, by the mo&s;t ab|ject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, rein&s;tated in power; but his late humiliations did not in the lea&s;t &s;erve to re|lax his cruelty or in&s;olence. One Peter of Pomfret, an hermit, had foretold, that the king this very year &s;hould lo&s;e his crown; and for that ra&s;h prophecy he had been thrown into Corfe ca&s;tle: John now determined to puni&s;h him as an impo&s;tor, and had him arraigned for that purpo&s;e. The poor hermit, who was pro|bably &s;ome wretched enthu&s;ia&s;t, a&s;&s;erted the truth of his prediction, alledging, that the king had given up his crown to the pope, from whom he again received it. This argument would have prevailed with any per&s;on le&s;s cruel than John. The defence was &s;uppo&s;ed to aug|ment the crime. Peter was dragged at hor&s;es tails to the town of Warham, and there hanged on a gibbet, with his &s;on.</P>
<P>In this manner, by repeated acts of cruelty, by expeditions without effect, and humiliations without re&s;erve, John was long become the de|te&s;tation of all mankind. Equally odious and contemptible, both in public and private life, he affronted the barons by his in&s;olence, and di&s;honoured their families by his debaucheries; he enraged them by his tyranny, and impove|ri&s;hed them by his exactions. But now hav|ing
<PB N="323" REF="333">
given up the independence of his kingdom to a foreign power, his &s;ubjects thought they had a right to claim a part of that power which he had been granting &s;o liberally to &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The barons had been long forming a con|federacy again&s;t him; but their union was bro|ken, or their aims di&s;appointed, by various and unfore&s;een accidents. Nothing at pre&s;ent &s;eem|ed &s;o much to forward their combination, as the concurrence of Langton the primate, who, tho' forced upon the kingdom by the &s;ee of Rome, amply compen&s;ated to his countrymen by his attachment to their real intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>This prelate, either a &s;incere friend of the people, or a &s;ecret enemy to the king, or &s;uppo&s;ing that in their mutual conflict the cler|gy would become &s;uperior, or, perhaps, in&s;ti|gated by all the&s;e motives, had formed a plan for reforming the government, which &s;till continued in a very fluctuating &s;ituation. At a &s;ynod of his prelates and clergy, convened in St. Paul's, on pretence of examining into the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the exiled bi&s;hops, he conferred privately with a number of barons, and expa|tiated upon the vices and the inju&s;tice of their &s;overeign. He &s;hewed them a copy of Henry the fir&s;t's charter, which was luckily found in a mona&s;tery; for &s;o little had tho&s;e charters,
<PB N="324" REF="334">
extorted from kings at their coronation, been hi|therto ob&s;erved, that they &s;oon came into di&s;|u&s;e, and were &s;hortly after buried in total ob|livion. There was but one copy of this im|portant charter now left in the kingdom; and that, as was ob&s;erved, was found in the rub|bi&s;h of an ob&s;cure mona&s;tery. However, it contained &s;o many articles tending to re&s;tore and fix the boundaries of ju&s;tice, that Lang|ton exhorted the confederating barons to in&s;i&s;t on the renewal and ob&s;ervance of it. The barons &s;wore they would lo&s;e their lives &s;ooner than forego tho&s;e claims that were found|ed on nature, on rea&s;on, and precedent. The confederacy every day began to &s;pread wider, and to take in almo&s;t all the barons of England.</P>
<P>A new and a more numerous meeting was &s;ummoned by Langton, at St. Edmund&s;bury, under colour of devotion. He again produced to the a&s;&s;embly the charter of Henry; and re|newed his exhortations to continue &s;tedfa&s;t and zealous in their former laudable con&s;piracy. The barons, enflamed by his eloquence, and &s;till more by their injuries, as al&s;o encouraged by their numbers, &s;olemnly &s;wore before the high altar to adhere to each other, to in&s;i&s;t on their de|mands, and to per&s;evere in their attempts, until they obtained redre&s;s. They agreed, that after
<PB N="325" REF="335">
Chri&s;tma&s;s they would prefer their common petition in a body; and in the mean time &s;epa|rated, with re&s;olutions of putting them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence; to enli&s;t men, and forti|fy their ca&s;tles. Pur&s;uant to their promi&s;e and obligations, they repaired in the beginning of January to London, accoutered in military garb and equipage, and pre&s;ented their demands to the king; alledging, that he had promi&s;ed to grant them, at the time he was ab&s;olved from his ex|communication when he con&s;ented to a confir|mation of the laws of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or. On the other hand, John, far from complying with their reque&s;t, re&s;ented their pre&s;umption; and even in&s;i&s;ted upon a promi&s;e, under their hands and &s;eals, that they would never demand, or at|tempt to extort, &s;uch privileges for the future. This, however, they boldly refu&s;ed, and con&s;ider|ed as an unprecedented act of power; &s;o that, per|ceiving their unanimity, in order for a while to break their combination, he de&s;ired further time to con&s;ider of an an&s;wer to their demands. He promi&s;ed, that at the fe&s;tival of Ea&s;ter, he would give a po&s;itive reply to their petition; and offer|ed them the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the bi|&s;hop of Ely, and the earl mare&s;chal, as &s;ure|ties for fulfilling his engagements. The ba|rons accepted the terms, and peaceably re|turned
<PB N="326" REF="336">
to their habitations. They &s;aw their own &s;trength, and were certain at any time to enforce their demands.</P>
<P>Freedom could never have found a more fa|vourable conjuncture for its extertions, than un|der the government of a weak and vicious monarch, &s;uch as John was, who&s;e re&s;i&s;tance only &s;erved to give &s;plendour to every oppo&s;i|tion. Although he had granted the barons a&s;&s;u|rances of his good intentions, yet nothing was farther from his heart than complying with their demands. In order to break their league, he had recour&s;e to the power of the clergy, of who&s;e influence he had experience, from his own recent misfortunes. He courted their favour, by granting them a charter, e&s;tabli&s;h|ing all tho&s;e rights, of which they were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and which he now pretended li|berally to be&s;tow, when he had not the ability to refu&s;e. He took the cro&s;s, to ingratiate him&s;elf &s;till farther; and, that he might enjoy tho&s;e privileges annexed to the profe&s;&s;ion, he appealed to the pope again&s;t the u&s;urpation of his barons, and craved his holy protection. Nor were the barons remi&s;s in their appeals to the pontiff. They alledged, that their ju&s;t pri|vileges were abridged, and entreated the inter|po&s;ition of his authority with the king. The
<PB N="327" REF="337">
pope did not he&s;itate in taking his party. A king who had already given up all to his pro|tection, who had regularly paid the &s;tipulated tributes, and who took every occa&s;ion to advance the intere&s;ts of the church, was much more meritorious in his eyes, than a confederacy of barons, whom, at be&s;t, he could manage with difficulty, and who&s;e fir&s;t endeavours would perhaps be to &s;hake off his authority. He, therefore, wrote letters to England, reproach|ing Langton, and the bi&s;hops, for favouring the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and commanding them to pro|mote peace between the parties. He exhorted the barons to conciliate the king, not with me|naces, but humble entreaties; and promi&s;ed, up|on their obedience, to interpo&s;e his own autho|rity in favour of &s;uch of their petitions as he &s;hould find to be ju&s;t. At the &s;ame time he an|nulled their a&s;&s;ociation, and forbad them to engage in any confederacy for the future.</P>
<P>Neither the bi&s;hops nor barons paid the lea&s;t regard to the pope's remon&s;trance; and as for John's pretences of taking the cro&s;s, they turned them into ridicule. They had for &s;ome time been &s;pectators of the intere&s;ted views of the &s;ee of Rome. They found, that the pope, in&s;tead of advancing the intere&s;ts of the church, his own individual intere&s;ts always were
<PB N="328" REF="338">
promoted. They continued, indeed, to re|verence his authority as much as ever, when exerted on points of duty; but they now began to &s;eparate between his religious and his political aims, adhering to the one, and rejecting the other. The bi&s;hops and ba|rons, therefore, on this occa&s;ion, employed all their arts and emi&s;&s;aries to kindle a &s;pirit of revolt in the nation; and there was now &s;carce a nobleman in the kingdom, who did not ei|ther per&s;onally engage in the de&s;ign, or &s;e|cretly favour the undertaking. After waiting till Ea&s;ter, when the king promi&s;ed to re|turn them an an&s;wer, upon the approach of that fe&s;tival they met, by agreement, at Stam|ford. There they a&s;&s;embled a force of above two thou&s;and knights, and a body of foot, to a prodigious number. From thence, elated with their power,<MILESTONE N="1215. Apr. 27." UNIT="A.D."> they marched to Brackley, about fifteen miles from Oxford, the place where the court then re&s;ided. John, hearing of their approach, &s;ent the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, the earl of Pembroke, and others of his council, to know the particulars of their reque&s;t, and what tho&s;e liberties were which they &s;o earne&s;tly importuned him to grant. The barons delivered a &s;chedule, containing the chief articles of their demands, and of which
<PB N="329" REF="339">
the charters of Henry and Edward formed the groundwork. No &s;ooner were the&s;e &s;hewn to the king, than he bur&s;t into a furious pa&s;&s;ion, and a&s;ked why the barons did not al&s;o demand his kingdom, &s;wearing, that he would never comply with &s;uch exorbitant demands. But the confederacy was now too &s;trong to fear much from the con&s;equences of his re&s;ent|ment. They cho&s;e Robert Fitzwalter for their general, whom they dignified with the titles of <Q>"Mare&s;chal of the army of God, and of the Holy Church,"</Q> and proceeded without fur|ther ceremony to make war upon the king. They be&s;ieged Northampton, they took Bed|ford, they were joyfully received into Lon|don. They wrote circular letters to all the nobility and gentlemen who had not yet de|clared in their favour, and menaced their e&s;tates with deva&s;tation, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al or delay.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the timid king was left at a place called Odiham in Surry, with a mean retinue of only &s;even knights, where he vainly endeavoured to avert the &s;torm, by the me|diation of his bi&s;hops and mini&s;ters. He ap|pealed to Langton again&s;t the&s;e fierce remon|&s;trants, little &s;u&s;pecting that the primate him|&s;elf was leagued again&s;t him. He de&s;ired him to
<PB N="330" REF="340">
fulminate the thunders of the church upon tho&s;e who had taken arms again&s;t their prince; and aggravated the impiety of their oppo&s;ition, as he was engaged in the pious and noble du|ties of the cru&s;ade. Langton permitted the tyrant to wa&s;te his pa&s;&s;ions in empty com|plaints, and declared he would not pa&s;s any cen&s;ure, where he found no delinquent. He promi&s;ed indeed, that much might be done in ca&s;e &s;ome foreign auxiliaries, which John had lately brought over, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the weak prince, &s;uppo&s;ing his advice &s;incere, di&s;banded a great body of Germans and Flemings, whom he had retained in his &s;er|vice. When the king had thus left him&s;elf without protection, he then thought it was the duty of Langton to perform his promi&s;e; and to give him the aid of the church, &s;ince he had di&s;carded all temporal a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But what was his &s;urprize, when the archbi&s;hop refu&s;ed to excommunicate a &s;ingle baron, but peremp|torily oppo&s;ed his commands. John, &s;tung with re&s;entment and regret, knew not where to turn for advice or comfort; as he had hitherto &s;ported with the happine&s;s of mankind, he found none that did not &s;ecretly rejoice in his &s;ufferings. He now began to think, that any
<PB N="331" REF="341">
terms were to be complied with; and that it was better to reign a limited prince, than &s;acri|fice his crown, and perhaps his life to ambi|tion. But fir&s;t he offered to refer all differences to the pope alone, or to eight barons, four to be cho&s;en by him&s;elf, and four by the confe|derates. This the barons &s;cornfully rejected. He then a&s;&s;ured them, that he would &s;ubmit at di&s;cretion; and that it was his &s;upreme plea&s;ure to grant all their demands: a confe|rence was accordingly appointed, and all things adju&s;ted for this mo&s;t important treaty.</P>
<P>The ground where the king's commi&s;&s;ioners met the barons was between Staines and Wind&s;or, at a place called Runimede, &s;till held in reverence by po&s;terity, as the &s;pot where the &s;tandard of freedom was fir&s;t erected in England. There the barons appeared, with a va&s;t number of knights and warriors, on the fifteenth day of June, while tho&s;e on the king's part, came a day or two after. Both &s;ides encamped apart, like open enemies. The debate between power and precedent are ge|nerally but of &s;hort continuance. The barons, determined on carrying their aims, would ad|mit of few abatements; and the king's agents being for the mo&s;t part in their intere&s;ts, few debates en&s;ued. After &s;ome days, the king,

with a facility that was &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, &s;igned and &s;ealed the charter required of him; a charter which continues in force to this day, and is the famous bulwark of Engli&s;h liber|ty, which now goes by the name of MAGNA CHARTA. This famous deed, either granted or &s;ecured very important privileges to tho&s;e or|ders of the kingdom that were already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom, namely, to the clergy, the barons, and the gentlemen; as for the inferior, and the greate&s;t part of the people, they were as yet held as &s;laves, and it was long before they could come to a participation of legal pro|tection.</P>
<P>The clergy, by this charter, had their for|mer grants confirmed. All check upon ap|peals to Rome was removed, by allowance to every man to depart the kingdom at plea&s;ure; and the fines upon the clergy, for any offence, were ordained to be proportionable to their tem|poral, not their eccle&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. With re&s;pect to the barons, they were &s;ecured in the cu&s;tody of the vacant abbies and convents, which were under their patronage. The re|liefs or duties to be paid for earldoms, baro|nies, and knights fees were fixed, which be|fore were arbitrary. This charter decreed, that barons &s;hould recover the lands of their
<PB N="333" REF="343">
va&s;&s;als, forfeited for felony, after being a year and a day in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; that they &s;hould enjoy the ward&s;hips of their military tenants, who held other lands of the crown by a different tenure; that a per&s;on knighted by the king, though a minor, &s;hould enjoy the privileges of a full grown man, provided he was a ward of the crown. It enacted, that heirs &s;hould be married without di&s;parage|ment, and before the marriage was contracted, the neare&s;t relations were to be informed of it. No &s;cutage, or tax, was to be impo&s;ed upon the people by the great council of the nation, except in three particular ca&s;es, the king's captivity, the knighting his elde&s;t &s;on, and the marrying his elde&s;t daughter. When the great council was to be a&s;&s;embled, the prelates, earls, and great barons were to be called to it by a particular writ, the le&s;&s;er barons by a &s;ummons of the &s;heriff. It went on to ordain, that the king &s;hall not &s;eize any baron's land for a debt to the crown, if the baron po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es per&s;onal property &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the debt. No va&s;&s;al &s;hall be allowed to &s;ell &s;o much of his land, as to incapacitate him from performing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice to his lord. With re&s;pect to the people, the following were the principal clau&s;es calculated for their benefit. It was ordained, that all the privileges, and
<PB N="334" REF="344">
immunities, granted by the king to his barons, &s;hould be al&s;o granted by the barons to their va&s;|&s;als. One weight, and one mea&s;ure, &s;hall be ob|&s;erved throughout the whole kingdom; mer|chants &s;hall be allowed to tran&s;act all bu&s;ine&s;s, without being expo&s;ed to any arbitrary tolls and impo&s;itions; they, and all freemen, &s;hall be allowed to go out of the kingdom, and return to it at plea&s;ure; London, and all cities and boroughs &s;hall pre&s;erve their ancient liberties, immunities, and free cu&s;toms; aids or taxes, &s;hall not be required of them, except by the con&s;ent of the great council; no towns, or in|dividuals, &s;hall be obliged to make, or &s;up|port bridges but by ancient cu&s;toms; the goods of every freeman &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of according to his will; if he die inte&s;tate, his heirs &s;hall &s;ucceed to them; no officer of the crown &s;hall take any hor&s;es, carts, or wood, without the con&s;ent of the owner; the king's courts of ju&s;tice &s;hall be &s;tationary, and &s;hall no longer follow his per&s;on; they &s;hall be open to every one, and ju&s;tice &s;hall no longer be bought, refu&s;ed, or delayed by them; the &s;heriffs &s;hall be incapacitated to hold pleas of the crown, and &s;hall not put any per&s;on upon his trial, from rumour or &s;u&s;picion alone, but upon the evidence of lawful witne&s;&s;es; no
<PB N="335" REF="345">
freeman &s;hall be taken or impri&s;oned, or di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his free tenement and liberties, or outlawed, or bani&s;hed, or anywi&s;e hurt or in|jured, unle&s;s by the legal judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land; and all who &s;uffered otherwi&s;e in this, and the two for|mer reigns, &s;hall be re&s;tored to their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; every freeman &s;hall be fined in proportion to his fault, and no fine &s;hall be levied on him to his utter ruin. Such were the &s;tipulations in favour of that part of the people, who, being either merchants, or the de&s;cendants of the nobles, or of the clergy, were thus independent of any immediate lord. But that part of the people who tilled the ground, who con&s;tituted, in all probability, the majority of the nation, had but one &s;ingle clau&s;e in their favour, which &s;tipulated, that no villain or ru&s;tic &s;hould by any fine be be|reaved of his carts, ploughs, and in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry. As for the re&s;t, they were con|&s;idered as a part of the property belonging to an e&s;tate, and pa&s;&s;ed away, with the hor&s;es, cows, and other moveables, at the will of the owner.</P>
<P>This great charter being agreed to by all, ratified, and mutually &s;igned by both parties, the barons, in order to &s;ecure the ob&s;ervance
<PB N="336" REF="346">
of it, and knowing the perfidious di&s;po&s;ition of the king, prevailed upon him to appoint twenty-five of their order as con&s;ervators of the public liberty. The&s;e were to admoni&s;h the king, if he &s;hould act contrary to his written obligations; and, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, they might levy war again&s;t him, and attack his ca&s;tles. John, with his u&s;ual perfidy, &s;eemed to &s;ubmit pa&s;&s;ively to all the&s;e regulations, however in|jurious to maje&s;ty; and even &s;ent writs to the &s;heriffs, ordering them to con&s;train every one to &s;wear obedience to the twenty-five barons. He pretended that his government, was hence|forth to undergo a total reformation, more in|dulgent to the liberty and independence of the people. His &s;ubjects therefore flattered them|&s;elves with brighter pro&s;pects; and it was thought the king's misfortunes had huma|nized his di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>But John's &s;eeming tranquillity was but di&s;&s;imulation. The more care his barons had taken to bind him to their will, the more impatient he grew under their re&s;trictions. He burned with de&s;ire to &s;hake off the conditions they had impo&s;ed upon him. The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions he had paid to the pope, and the in&s;ults he had &s;u&s;tained from the king of France, &s;lightly af|fected him, as they were his equals; but the
<PB N="337" REF="347">
&s;en&s;e of his &s;ubjection to his own va&s;&s;als, &s;unk deep on his mind; and he was determined at all events, to recover his former power of doing mi&s;chief. He grew &s;ullen, &s;ilent, and re&s;erved. He &s;hunned the &s;ociety of his for|mer companions; and even retired into the I&s;le of Wight, as if to hide his di&s;grace in &s;o|litude. But he was &s;till, however, employed in machinations to obtain revenge. He had &s;ent to the continent to enli&s;t a large body of mer|cenary troops; he had made complaints to the pope of the in&s;urrections of his &s;ubjects again&s;t him; and the pontiff very warmly e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e. A bull was &s;ent over, annulling the whole charter; and at the &s;ame time the fo|reign forces arrived, whom John intended to employ in giving his intentions efficacy.</P>
<P>He now, no longer took &s;helter under the arts of di&s;&s;imulation; but acted the bold ty|rant, a character that became him much bet|ter. The barons, after obtaining the char|ter, &s;eemed to have been lulled into a fatal &s;e|curity; and took no mea&s;ures for a&s;&s;embling their forces, in ca&s;e of the introduction of a foreign army. The king, therefore, was for &s;ome time undi&s;puted ma&s;ter of the field, at the head of an army of Germans, Braban|tines, and Flemings, all eager for battle, and
<PB N="338" REF="348">
in&s;pired with the hopes of dividing the king|dom among them. The ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter was fir&s;t inve&s;ted; and, after an ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance, was obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. John, irritated at the length of the &s;iege, was going to hang the governor, and all the gar|ri&s;on, contrary to the laws of war; but at the interce&s;&s;ion of one of his generals, he only put the inferior pri&s;oners to death. After the reduction of this important fortre&s;s, the royal intere&s;ts began to prevail; and two armies were formed, with one of which the king marched northward, &s;ubduing all fortre&s;&s;es and towns that lay in his way. The other army, commanded by the earl of Sali&s;bury, was equally vigorous and &s;ucce&s;sful; &s;everal &s;ub|mitted at its approach, and London it&s;elf was in the utmo&s;t danger. The foreign mer|cenaries committed the mo&s;t horrible cruelties in their march, and ravaged the country in a mo&s;t dreadful manner. Urged on at once by their natural rapacity, and the cruelty of the king, nothing was &s;een but the flames of villages and ca&s;tles; con&s;ternation and mi&s;ery were pic|tured in the looks of the people; and tortures were every where exerci&s;ed by the &s;oldiers, to make the inhabitants reveal their riches. Where|ever the king marched, the provinces were laid
<PB N="339" REF="349">
wa&s;te on each &s;ide his pa&s;&s;age; as he con&s;idered every e&s;tate, which was not his immediate pro|perty, as entirely ho&s;tile, and a proper object of military execution.</P>
<P>The barons,<MILESTONE N="1215" UNIT="A.D."> reduced to this deplorable &s;i|tuation, their e&s;tates de&s;troyed, their liberties annihilated, and their per&s;ons expo&s;ed to the revenge of a malicious tyrant, lo&s;t all power of &s;elf-defence. They were able to rai&s;e no army in England, that could &s;tand before their ravagers, and yet they had no hopes from &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. In this de&s;perate exigence, they appli|ed to the old enemy of their country, Philip, king of France; and offered to acknowledge Lewis, the elde&s;t &s;on of that monarch, as their &s;overeign, on condition of his affording them protection again&s;t their dome&s;tic de&s;troy|er. No proffer could have been more agreeable to this ambitious monarch, who long wanted to annex England to the re&s;t of his dominions. He therefore in&s;tantly embraced the propo&s;al of the barons; of whom, however, he de|manded five and twenty ho&s;tages for the per|formance of their promi&s;e. The&s;e being &s;ent over, he began to make the mo&s;t diligent pre|parations for this expedition, regardle&s;s of the menaces of the pope, who threatened Philip with excommunication, and actually excom|municated Lewis the &s;on &s;ome time after. The
<PB N="340" REF="350">
fir&s;t detachment con&s;i&s;ted of a body of &s;even thou&s;and men, which he reinforced &s;oon after by a powerful army, commanded by Lewis him&s;elf, who landed at Sandwich without op|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>John, who but ju&s;t now &s;aw him&s;elf in the career of victory, upon the landing of the French army was &s;topped all of a &s;ud|den, and found him&s;elf bla&s;ted in his re|venge and ambition. The fir&s;t effect of their appearance was, that mo&s;t of the foreign troops de&s;erted, refu&s;ing to &s;erve again&s;t the heir of their monarchy. Many con&s;iderable noblemen al&s;o de&s;erted his party; and his ca&s;tles daily fell into the hands of his enemies. Thus England &s;aw nothing but a pro&s;pect of being every way undone. If John &s;ucceeded, a tyrannical and implacable mo|narch was to be their tormentor; if Lewis &s;hould prevail, the country was ever after to &s;ubmit to a more powerful monarchy, and was to become a province of France. What neither human prudence could fore&s;ee, nor policy &s;ug|ge&s;t, was brought about by an happy and unex|pected concurrence of events. Neither John nor Lewis &s;ucceeded in their de&s;igns upon the people's happine&s;s and freedom.</P>
<P>Lewis having vainly endeavoured to pacify the pope's legate, re&s;olved to &s;et the pope at
<PB N="341" REF="351">
defiance, and marched his army again&s;t the ca&s;tle of Roche&s;ter, which he quickly reduced. Thence he advanced to London, where the barons and burghers did him homage, and took the oath of fealty, after he had &s;worn to confirm the liberties and privileges of the peo|ple. Though never crowned king of Eng|land, yet he exerci&s;ed &s;overeign authority, granting charters, and appointing officers of &s;tate. But how flattering &s;oever the pro&s;pect before him appeared, yet there was a &s;ecret jealou&s;y that was de&s;troying his ambition, and undermining all his preten&s;ions. Through a great degree of imprudence he on every occa&s;ion &s;hewed a vi&s;ible preference to his natural French &s;ubjects, to the detriment of tho&s;e he came to govern. The &s;u&s;pi|cions of the Engli&s;h again&s;t him were &s;till farther encrea&s;ed, by the death-bed confe&s;|&s;ion of the count de Melun, one of his cour|tiers, who declared to tho&s;e about him, that it was the intention of Lewis to exterminate the Engli&s;h barons as traitors, and to be&s;tow their dignities and e&s;tates upon his own French &s;ubjects, upon who&s;e fidelity he could &s;afely rely. Whatever truth there might be in this confe&s;&s;ion, it greatly operated upon the minds of the people; &s;o that the earl of Sali&s;bury, and other noblemen, who had for&s;aken John's
<PB N="342" REF="352">
party, once more de&s;erted to him, and gave no &s;mall lu&s;tre to his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time, John was a&s;&s;embling a con&s;iderable army, with a view to make one great effort for the crown; and at the head of a large body of troops, he re&s;olved to pe|netrate into the heart of the kingdom. With the&s;e re&s;olutions he departed from Lynn, which, for its fidelity, he had di&s;tingui&s;hed with many marks of favour, and directed his route towards Lincoln&s;hire. His road lay along the &s;hore, which was overflowed at high-water; but not being appri&s;ed of this, or being igno|rant of the tides of the place, he lo&s;t all his car|riages, trea&s;ure, and baggage, by their influx. He him&s;elf e&s;caped with the greate&s;t difficulty, and arrived at the abbey of Swin&s;tead, where his grief for the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained, and the di&s;tracted &s;tate of his affairs, threw him into a fever, which &s;oon appeared to be fatal. Next day, being unable to ride on hor&s;eback, he was carried in a litter to the ca&s;tle of Seaford, and from thence removed to Newark, where, after having made his will, he died in the fifty-fir&s;t year of his age, and the eighteenth of his reign.</P>
<P>This mon&s;ter's character is too &s;trongly marked, in every tran&s;action of his life, to
<PB N="343" REF="353">
leave the &s;malle&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for di&s;entangling it, from the ordinary occurrences of his reign. It was de&s;tructive to the people, and ruinous to him&s;elf. He left two legitimate &s;ons behind him; Henry, who &s;ucceeded him on the throne, and was now nine years of age; Richard, who was about &s;even. He left al&s;o three daughters; Jane, married to Alex|ander, king of Scots; Eleanor, married to the earl of Pembroke; and I&s;abella, married to the emperor Frederic II. His illegitimate children were numerous, but unnoted.</P>

</FIGURE>CHAP. XI. HENRY III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Engli&s;h being now happily rid of a tyrant, who threatened the kingdom with de|&s;truction, had &s;till his rival to fear, who only aimed at gaining the crown, to make it &s;ub|&s;ervient to that of France. The partiality of Lewis on every occa&s;ion was the more di&s;gu&s;t|ing, as it was the le&s;s concealed. The diffi|dence which he con&s;tantly di&s;covered of the
<PB N="345" REF="355">
fidelity of the barons, encrea&s;ed that jealou&s;y which was &s;o natural for them to entertain on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. An accident happened, which rendered him &s;till more di&s;agreeable to his new &s;ubjects. The government of the ca&s;tle of Hert|ford becoming vacant, it was claimed as of right by Robert Fitzwalter, a nobleman who had been extremely active in his &s;ervice: but his claim was rejected. It was now, there|fore, apparent, that the Engli&s;h would be ex|cluded from every tru&s;t under the French go|vernment; and that foreigners were to engro&s;s all the favour of their new &s;overeign. Nor was the excommunication denounced again&s;t Lewis by the pope entirely without its effect. In fact the people were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to con|&s;ider a cau&s;e as impious and profane, for which they had already entertained an un&s;urmountable aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition of the people, the claims of any native, with even the &s;malle&s;t preten|&s;ions to favour, would have had a mo&s;t proba|ble chance of &s;ucceeding. A claim was accord|ingly made in favour of young Henry, the &s;on of the late king, who was now but nine years of age. The earl of Pembroke, a nobleman of great worth and valour, who had faithfully adhered to John in all the fluctuations of his
<PB N="346" REF="356">
fortune, was, at the time of that prince's death, mar&s;hal of England, and con&s;equently at the head of the army. This nobleman determined to &s;upport the declining intere&s;ts of the young prince, and had him &s;olemnly crowned by the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Bath, at Glouce&s;ter. In order al&s;o to enlarge and confirm his own authority upon the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, a general council of the barons was &s;ummoned at Bri&s;tol, where the earl was cho&s;en guardian to the king, and protector of the kingdom. His fir&s;t act was highly plea&s;ing to the people, and reconciled them to the intere&s;ts of the young prince. He made young Henry grant a new charter of liberties, which con|tained but very few exceptions from that al|ready extorted from his predece&s;&s;or. To this was added al&s;o a charter, a&s;certaining the ju|ri&s;diction, and the boundaries of the royal fo|re&s;ts, which from thence was called the Charta Fore&s;ta. By this it was enacted, that all the fo|re&s;ts which had been enclo&s;ed &s;ince the reign of Henry the &s;econd, &s;hould be again re&s;tor|ed to the people, and new perambulations made for that purpo&s;e. Offences on the fo|re&s;ts were no longer declared to be capital, but puni&s;hable by gentler laws; and all the proprietors of land were granted a power of
<PB N="347" REF="357">
cutting and u&s;ing their own wood at plea&s;ure. To the&s;e mea&s;ures, which gave univer&s;al &s;a|tisfaction, Pembroke took care to add his more active endeavours again&s;t the enemy. He wrote letters, in the king's name, to all the malecontent barons, a&s;&s;uring them of his re|&s;olutions to govern them by their own charters; and repre&s;ented the danger which they in|curred by their adherence to a French mo|narch, who only wanted to oppre&s;s them. The&s;e a&s;&s;urances were attended with the de|&s;ired effect. The party in the intere&s;ts of Lewis began to lo&s;e ground every day, by the de&s;ertion of &s;ome of its mo&s;t powerful lead|ers. The earls of Sali&s;bury, Arundel, and Warene, together with William Mar&s;hall, elde&s;t &s;on of the protector, came over to the young king; and all the re&s;t of the barons appeared de&s;irous of an opportunity of follow|ing their example.</P>
<P>The protector was &s;o much &s;trengthened by the&s;e acce&s;&s;ions, that he took the field; but the French army appearing, he was obliged to retire. The count de Perche, who command|ed for Lewis, was &s;o elated with his &s;uperiori|ty, that he marched to Lincoln; and being admitted into the town, began to attack the ca&s;tle, which he &s;oon reduced to extremity.
<PB N="348" REF="358">
The protector, now finding that a deci&s;ive blow was to be &s;truck, &s;ummoned all his forces from every quarter, in order to relieve a place of &s;o much importance; and he, in turn, appear|ed &s;o much &s;uperior to the French, that they &s;hut them&s;elves up within the city, and re&s;olv|ed to take &s;helter behind the walls. But the garri&s;on of the ca&s;tle having received a &s;trong reinforcement, made a vigorous &s;ally upon the be&s;iegers, while the Engli&s;h army a&s;&s;aulted them from without; and &s;caling the walls, entered the city &s;word in hand. Lincoln was delivered over to be pillaged; the French army was to|tally routed, the commander in chief was kill|ed, and &s;everal of the re&s;t made pri&s;oners of war. This misfortune of the French was but the forerunner of another. Their fleet, which was bringing over reinforcements, both of men and money, was attacked by the Engli&s;h, un|der the command of Philip d'Albiney, and was repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. d'Albiney is &s;aid to have practi&s;ed a &s;tratagem again&s;t them, to which he owed his victory. Having got the wind of the French, he ordered his men to throw quicklime in the faces of the enemy, which blinding them, they were di&s;abled from further defence. The&s;e repeated lo&s;&s;es &s;erved, at length, to give peace to the kingdom.
<PB N="349" REF="359">
Lewis finding his cau&s;e every day declining, and that it was at la&s;t grown wholly de&s;perate, began to be anxious for the &s;afety of his per&s;on; and was glad to &s;ubmit to any conditions fa|vourable to his retreat. He concluded a peace with the protector; in which he agreed to leave the kingdom; and in which he exacted, in return, an indemnity for all his adherents. Thus ended a civil war, which had for &s;ome time drenched the kingdom in blood; and in which not only its con&s;titution, but all its happine&s;s &s;eemed irretrievable. The death of John, and the abdication of Lewis, were circum&s;tances that could hardly be expected, even by the mo&s;t &s;anguine well-wi&s;hers of their coun|try. The one was brought about by accident, and the other by the prudence and intrepidity of the earl of Pembroke, the protector, who him&s;elf did not long &s;urvive his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The young king was of a character the very oppo&s;ite of his father; <MILESTONE N="1216" UNIT="A.D."> as he grew up to man's e&s;tate, he was found to be gentle, merciful, and humane; he appeared ea&s;y and good-natured to his dependents; but no way formidable to his enemies. Without activity or vigour, he was unfit to conduct in war; without di&s;tru&s;t or &s;u&s;|picion, he was impo&s;ed upon in times of peace. A king of &s;uch beneficent and meek qualifica|tions, was very little fitted to hold the reins of
<PB N="350" REF="360">
a kingdom, &s;uch as England was at that time, where every order was a&s;piring to independence, and endeavouring to plume them&s;elves with the &s;poils of the prerogative. The protector was &s;ucceeded in his office by Peter, bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter, and Hubert de Burgh, high ju&s;ticiary; but no authority in the governors could control a people, who had been long u&s;ed to civil di&s;cord, and caught every &s;light occa&s;ion to magnify &s;mall offences into public grievances. The no|bles were now, in effect, the tyrants of the peo|ple; for having almo&s;t totally de&s;troyed the power of the crown; and being encouraged by the weakne&s;s of a minority, they con&s;idered the laws as in&s;truments made only for their de|fence, and with which they alone were to go|vern. They therefore, retained by force the royal ca&s;tles, which they had u&s;urped during the former convul&s;ions; they oppre&s;&s;ed their va&s;&s;als; they infe&s;ted their weaker neighbours; and they invited all di&s;orderly people to take protection under their authority. It is not then to be wondered, that there were many complaints again&s;t tho&s;e who were placed over them; Hubert de Burgh, who &s;eemed to take the lead in government, at this time expe|rienced many con&s;piracies formed not only a|gain&s;t his authority, but his per&s;on; and &s;o lit|tle did the confederates regard &s;ecrecy, that
<PB N="351" REF="361">
they openly avowed their intentions of remov|ing him from his office. The barons being required by him to give up their ca&s;tles, they not only refu&s;ed, but &s;everal of them entered into a confederacy to &s;urpri&s;e London; and, with the Earls of Che&s;ter and Albemarle at their head, they advanced as far as Waltham with that in|tention. At that time, however, their aims were fru&s;trated by the diligence of the government: but they did not de&s;i&s;t from their enterprize; for meeting &s;ome time after at Leice&s;ter, in order to &s;eize the king, they found them|&s;elves di&s;appointed in this, as in their former attempt. In this threatening commotion, the power of the church was obliged to inter|po&s;e; and the archbi&s;hops and prelates threa|tened the barons with the &s;entence of excom|munication, &s;hould they per&s;i&s;t in either of their attempts upon the king, or in detaining his ca&s;tles. This menace at la&s;t prevailed. Mo&s;t of the fortre&s;&s;es were &s;urrendered; and the number at that time is &s;aid to have amounted to above a thou&s;and. But though Henry gain|ed this advantage by the prudence and per&s;e|verance of his mini&s;ter, yet his power was &s;till e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a very weak foundation. A conte&s;t with his brother Richard, who had a|ma&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;ums of money, as to be reckoned the riche&s;t prince in Europe, &s;oon &s;hewed
<PB N="352" REF="362">
the weakne&s;s both of his power and his di&s;po&s;i|tion. Richard had unju&s;tly expelled an infe|rior baron from his manor; and the king in&s;i&s;t|ed upon his re&s;toring him. The other per&s;i&s;t|ing in his refu&s;al, a powerful confederacy was formed, and an army a&s;&s;embled; which the king had neither power nor courage to re&s;i&s;t. Richard's inju&s;tice was declared legal; and his re&s;entment was obliged to be mollified by grants of much greater importance than the manor which had been the fir&s;t ground of the quarrel. Thus was the king obliged to &s;ub|mit to all the demands of his haughty va&s;&s;als; and he had &s;carce any per&s;on who &s;eemed &s;oli|citous for his intere&s;ts, but Hubert de Burgh, whom neverthele&s;s, he di&s;carded in a &s;udden ca|price; and thus expo&s;ed his faithful &s;ervant to the violent per&s;ecution of his enemies. Among the many frivolous crimes objected to him, he was accu&s;ed of gaining the king's affections by enchantment, and of &s;ending the prince of Wales a jewel, which he had &s;tolen from the trea&s;ury, that rendered the wearer invulnera|ble. Hubert, when he found his ruin re&s;olv|ed on, was compelled to take &s;anctuary in a church; but the king was prevailed upon to give orders for his being dragged from thence. Thus irre&s;olute and timid, the orders of one moment contradicted tho&s;e of the preceding.
<PB N="353" REF="363">
He quickly recalled the orders he had given, and again renewed them. The clergy inter|po&s;ed, and obliged the king to permit him to return to his &s;anctuary; but he was once more con&s;trained to &s;urrender him&s;elf a pri&s;oner, and was confined to the ca&s;tle of Devi&s;es. From thence Hubert made his e&s;cape; and, though he afterwards obtained the king's pardon, he never te&s;tified any de&s;ire to encounter future dangers in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>But as weak princes are never to be without governing favourites, the place of Hubert was &s;oon &s;upplied by Peter de Roches, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, a Poictevin by birth, one equally remarkable for his arbitrary conduct, and for his courage and abilities. Henry, in pur|&s;uance of this prelate's advice, invited over a great number of Poictevins, and other foreign|ers,<MILESTONE N="1231" UNIT="A.D."> who having neither principles nor fortunes at home, were willing to adopt whatever &s;chemes their employer &s;hould propo&s;e. Every office and command was be&s;towed on the&s;e un|principled &s;trangers, who&s;e avarice and rapaci|ty were exceeded only by their pride and in|&s;olence. So unju&s;t a partiality to &s;trangers very naturally excited the jealou&s;y of the barons; and they even ventured to a&s;&s;ure the king, that if he did not di&s;mi&s;s all foreigners from court,
<PB N="354" REF="364">
they would drive both him and them out of the kingdom. But the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter had taken his mea&s;ures &s;o well, that he brought over many of the mo&s;t powerful of the confede|rates, and the e&s;tates of the more obnoxious ba|rons were confi&s;cated, for the benefit of his needy countrymen. In the&s;e violent mea&s;ures the king was a calm con&s;enting &s;pectator; he was contented with pre&s;ent advantages; and while the&s;e confi&s;cations procured immediate wealth, he little regarded the con&s;equence. But as this king was chiefly &s;wayed by tu|multuary remon&s;trances, another confederacy, at the head of which the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury was, induced him to di&s;mi&s;s his mini&s;ter, and to &s;end him and his needy countrymen out of the kingdom. Encouragement to fo|reigners was the chief complaint again&s;t the king; and it was now expected that the people were to be no longer aggrieved by &s;eeing &s;uch advanced above them. But their hopes were quickly di&s;appointed; for the king having married Eleanor,<MILESTONE N="1236" UNIT="A.D."> daughter of the count of Provence, he transferred his affections to the &s;trangers of that country, whom he care&s;&s;ed with the fonde&s;t affection, and enriched with the mo&s;t imprudent genero&s;ity. Places, digni|ties, and va&s;t trea&s;ures, were lavi&s;hed upon
<PB N="355" REF="365">
them; many young noblemen, who were wards to the crown, were married to wives of that country; and when the &s;ources of the king's liberality were dried up, he re&s;umed all the grants he had formerly made, in order to con|tinue his favours. The re&s;entment of every rank of people was excited by this mi&s;chievous attachment; but their anger was &s;carce kept within bounds when they &s;aw a new &s;warm of the&s;e intruders come over from Ga&s;cony, with I&s;abella, the king's mother, who had been &s;ome time before married to the count de la Marche. To the&s;e ju&s;t cau&s;es of complaint were added the king's un&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions to the con|tinent, his total want of oeconomy, and his op|pre&s;&s;ive exactions, which were but the re&s;ult of the former. The kingdom therefore waited with gloomy re&s;olution, re&s;olving to take vengeance, when the general di&s;content was arrived at ma|turity.</P>
<P>To the&s;e temporal di&s;contents, tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the rapacity of the &s;ee of Rome were add|ed &s;hortly after. The clergy of England, while they were contending for the power of the pope, were not aware that they were effectually op|po&s;ing their own intere&s;ts; for the pontiff hav|ing, by various arts, obtained the inve&s;titure of all livings and prelacies in the kingdom,
<PB N="356" REF="366">
failed not to fill up every vacancy with his own creatures. His power being e&s;tabli&s;hed, he now began to turn it to his profit, and to enrich the church by every art of extortion and avarice.<MILESTONE N="1253" UNIT="A.D."> At this time, all the chief benefices of the kingdom were conferred on Italians. Great numbers of that nation were &s;ent over at one time to be provided for; the king's chaplain alone is &s;aid to have held at once &s;even hundred eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings. The&s;e abu&s;es became too glaring even for the blind &s;uper&s;tition of the people to &s;ubmit to; they ro&s;e in tumults a|gain&s;t the Italian clergy, pillaged their barns, wa&s;ted their fields, and in&s;ulted their per&s;ons. But the&s;e were tran&s;ient ob&s;tacles to the papal en|croachments. The pontiff exacted the revenues of all vacant benefices, the twentieth of all eccle&s;ia&s;tical livings without exception, the third of &s;uch as exceeded an hundred marks a year, and the half of &s;uch as were held by non|re&s;idents: he claimed the goods of all inte&s;tate clergymen: he pretended a right of inheriting all money got by u&s;ury, and he levied voluntary contributions on the people. The indignities which the people &s;uffered from the&s;e intruding eccle&s;ia&s;tics were &s;till more oppre&s;&s;ive than their exactions. On a certain occa&s;ion, while the Engli&s;h were complaining of the avarice of
<PB N="357" REF="367">
their king, and his profu&s;ion to foreign favou|rites, the pope's legate made his triumphal en|try into England, and &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s induced him to vi&s;it Oxford before his return. He was received there with all po&s;&s;ible &s;plendour and ceremony; and the mo&s;t &s;umptuous pre|parations were made for his table. One day, as the legate's dinner was preparing, &s;everal &s;cholars of the univer&s;ity entered his kitchen, &s;ome incited by motives of curio&s;ity, others of hunger: while they were thus employed, in ad|miring the luxury and opulence in which this dignitary was &s;erved, and of which they were only to be &s;pectators, a poor Iri&s;h &s;cholar ven|tured to beg relief from the cook, who was an Italian, as were all the legate's dome&s;tics. This brutal fellow, in&s;tead of giving the poor Iri&s;h|man an alms, threw a ladle full of boiling water in his face, and &s;eemed to exult in his brutality. The indignity &s;o provoked a Wel&s;h &s;tudent, who was near, that with a bow, which he happened to have in his hand, he &s;hot the cook dead with an arrow. The legate hearing the tumult, retired in a fright to the tower of the church, where he remained till night-fall. As &s;oon as he found that he might retire in &s;afety, he ha&s;tened to the king, who was then at London, and complained to him of the outrage. The king, with his u&s;ual
<PB N="358" REF="368">
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the church, appeared in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and offered to give immediate &s;atis|faction, by putting the offenders to death. The legate at fir&s;t &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t upon ven|geance, but at length was appea&s;ed by a pro|per &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the univer&s;ity. All the &s;cholars of that &s;chool, which had offended him, were ordered to be &s;tript of their gowns; and to go in proce&s;&s;ion bare-footed, with halters about their necks, to the legate's hou&s;e, and there were directed humbly to crave his ab&s;o|lution and pardon.</P>
<P>But the impo&s;itions of the church appeared in their mo&s;t con&s;picuous point of view in a tran&s;action between the pope and the king. The court of Rome, &s;ome time before, had reduced the kingdom of Sicily to the &s;ame &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage to which England had &s;ub|mitted; but Mainfroy, an u&s;urper, under pretence of governing the kingdom for the lawful heir, had &s;eized upon the crown, and was re&s;olved to reject the pope's authority. As the pontiff found that his own force alone was not &s;ufficient to vindicate his claims, he had recour&s;e to Richard, the king's brother, who&s;e wealth he was not ignorant of; and to him, and his heirs, he offered the kingdom of Sicily, with only one condition, that he &s;hould regain it from the hands of the u&s;urper.
<PB N="359" REF="369">
Richard was too well acquainted with the dif|ficulty of the enterprize to comply with &s;uch a propo&s;al; but when it was made to the king him&s;elf, the weak monarch, dazzled with the &s;plendour of the conque&s;t, embraced the pro|po&s;al with ardour. Accordingly, without re|flecting on the con&s;equences, or ever con&s;ult|ing the parliament, he gave the pope unlimited credit to expend whatever &s;ums he &s;hould think proper for completing the conque&s;t of that kingdom. This was what the pope ex|pected and de&s;ired; he &s;oon brought Henry in creditor for more than an hundred thou&s;and marks, a debt which he had never been advi&s;ed with in the contracting. Henry was mortified at the greatne&s;s of the &s;um, and &s;till more at the little pro&s;pect of its being laid out with &s;ucce&s;s; but he dreaded the pope's di&s;|plea&s;ure, and therefore he re&s;olved to have recour&s;e to parliament for a &s;upply.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al &s;tate of indignation, it may readily be imagined, that the barons were more liberal of their complaints than their &s;upplies. They determined not to lavi&s;h their money on favourites without merit, and expe|ditions without a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. The clergy them&s;elves began to turn again&s;t their &s;piritual father; and the bi&s;hop of London boldly a&s;&s;erted, that if the king, and the pope,
<PB N="360" REF="370">
&s;hould take the mitre from his head, he would clap on an helmet. But though the bi&s;hops and clergy were obliged to acquie&s;ce in furni&s;hing a part of this ab&s;urd expence, the barons &s;till continued refractory; and in&s;tead of &s;upplies, for &s;ome time an&s;wered with ex|po&s;tulations. They urged the king's partiality to foreigners, they aggravated the injuries of his &s;ervants, and the unju&s;t &s;eizures made by his of|ficers from men of mercantile profe&s;&s;ions. The parliament therefore was di&s;&s;olved, (for &s;o now the general a&s;&s;embly of the nation began to be called) and another &s;oon after was convened with as little &s;ucce&s;s. The urgency of the king's af|fairs, required that money &s;hould be procured at any rate; and yet the legate never failed, upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions, to ob&s;truct the king's demands by making &s;everal for him&s;elf. It was now, there|fore, that Henry went among&s;t &s;uch of his &s;ub|jects as were firmly attached to him, and begged for a&s;&s;i&s;tance at their own hou&s;es. At one time, he would get money by pretending to take the cro&s;s; at another he would prevail by a&s;&s;ert|ing, that he was re&s;olved to re-conquer his French dominions. At length his barons, per|ceiving the exigencies to which he was reduced, &s;eemed, in mere pity, willing to grant him aid; and, upon his promi&s;ing to grant them
<PB N="361" REF="371">
plenary redre&s;s, a very liberal &s;upply was ob|tained,<MILESTONE N="1255" UNIT="A.D."> for which he renewed their charter with more than u&s;ual &s;olemnity. All the prelates and abbots were a&s;&s;embled, with burning ta|pers in their hands; the Magna Charta was read in their pre&s;ence; and they denounced &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t all who &s;hould infringe upon its deci&s;ions; they then put out their tapers on the ground, and ex|claimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"May every &s;oul that proves fal&s;e to this agreement, &s;o &s;tink and corrupt in hell."</Q> The king had his part in the cere|mony, and &s;ubjoined, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"So help me God, I will inviolably keep all the&s;e things, as I am a man, as I am a chri&s;tian, as I am a knight, and as I am a king crowned and anointed."</Q> Thus &s;olemn was their mutual engagements; but the wretched Henry had no &s;ooner receiv|ed the &s;upplies, for which his parliament had been convoked, than he forgot every article of what he had &s;o &s;olemnly agreed to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>Though the king, in the la&s;t convention, had &s;olemnly engaged to follow the advice of Eng|li&s;h coun&s;ellors, yet he was directed in all his mea&s;ures by foreigners, and William de Va|lence, on whom he conferred various honours, gra&s;ped at every po&s;t of profit that was in the royal power to be&s;tow. This imprudent pre|ference,
<PB N="362" REF="372">
joined to a thou&s;and other illegal eva|&s;ions of ju&s;tice, at la&s;t impelled Simon Mont|fort, earl of Leice&s;ter, to attempt an innova|tion in the government, and to wre&s;t the &s;ceptre from the feeble hand that held it. This nobleman was the &s;on of the famous general who commanded again&s;t the Albigen&s;es, a &s;ect of enthu&s;ia&s;ts that had been de&s;troyed &s;ome time before in the kingdom of Savoy. He was married to the king's &s;i&s;ter; and, by his power and addre&s;s, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;trong intere&s;t in the nation, having gained equally the affec|tions of the great and the little. The king was the only per&s;on who&s;e favour he di&s;dained to cul|tivate. He &s;o much di&s;regarded Henry's friend|&s;hip or enmity, that when the monarch, upon a certain occa&s;ion, called him traitor, Leice&s;ter gave him the lie; and told him, that if he were not his &s;overeign, he would &s;oon make him repent of his in&s;ult. Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pow|er too great for a &s;ubject, he had long, though &s;ecretly, a&s;pired at the throne, and filled all places with complaints of the king's inju&s;tice, partiality, and inability to govern. Having at la&s;t found his de&s;igns ripe for execution, he called a meeting of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable barons; and concealing his private ambition under the ma&s;k of public concern, he repre|&s;ented
<PB N="363" REF="373">
to them the nece&s;&s;ity of reforming the &s;tate. He exaggerated the oppre&s;&s;ions of the lower orders of people, the violations of the barons' privileges, the continued plun|der of the clergy, and the perfidy of the king. His popularity and his power add|ed weight to his eloquence; and the barons entered into a re&s;olution of redre&s;&s;ing public grievances, by taking the admini&s;tration of the government into their own hands.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place where this formidable confe|deracy fir&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf, was in the parli|ament-hou&s;e, where the barons appeared in complete armour. The king, upon his entry, a&s;ked them what was their intention; to which they &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively replied, to make him their &s;overeign, by confirming his power, and to have their grievances redre&s;&s;ed. Henry, who was ready enough to promi&s;e whatever was de|manded, in&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured them of his intenti|ons to give all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction; and for that purpo&s;e, &s;ummoned another parliament at Ox|ford, to dige&s;t a new plan of government, and to elect proper per&s;ons who were to be entru&s;ted with the chief authority. This parliament, afterwards called the <HI>mad parliament,</HI> went ex|peditiou&s;ly to work upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of refor|mation. Twenty-four barons were appointed,
<PB N="364" REF="374">
with &s;upreme authority, to reform the abu&s;es of the &s;tate, and Leice&s;ter was placed at their head. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was calculated for the good of the people, as it contained the rude out-line of the hou&s;e of commons, which makes a part of the con&s;titution at this day. They or|dered,<MILESTONE N="June 11, 1258."> that four knights &s;hould be cho&s;en by each county, who &s;hould examine into the grievances of their re&s;pective con&s;tituents, and to attend at the en&s;uing parliament, to give information of their complaints. They ordained, that three &s;e&s;|&s;ions of parliament &s;hould be regularly held every year; that a new high &s;heriff &s;hould be annually elected; that no wards nor ca&s;tles &s;hould be entru&s;ted to foreigners; no new fore&s;ts made; nor the revenues of any counties let to farm. The&s;e con&s;titutions were &s;o ju&s;t, that &s;ome of them have been continued to the pre&s;ent time; but it was not the &s;ecurity of the people, but the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their own power, that this odious confederacy endeavour|ed to effect. In&s;tead of re&s;igning their power, when they had fulfilled the purpo&s;es of their appointment, they &s;till maintained them&s;elves in an u&s;urped authority; at one time pre|tending that they had not as yet dige&s;ted all ne|ce&s;&s;ary regulations for the benefit of the &s;tate; at another, that their continuance in power
<PB N="365" REF="375">
was the only remedy the people had again&s;t the faithle&s;s character of the king: in &s;hort, they re&s;olved to maintain their &s;tations till they &s;hould think proper to re&s;ign their authority. The whole &s;tate accordingly underwent a complete alteration; all its former officers were di&s;placed, and creatures of the twenty-four barons were put in their room; they had even the effrontery to impo&s;e an oath upon every in|dividual of the nation, declaring an implicit obe|dience to all the regulations executed, and to be yet executed, by the barons, who were thus appointed as rulers. They not only abridged the authority of the king, but the efficacy of parliament, giving up to twelve per&s;ons all parliamentary power between each &s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus the&s;e in&s;olent nobles, after having tram|pled upon the crown, now threw pro&s;trate all the rights of the people, and a vile oligarchy was on the point of being e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t oppo&s;ition that was made to the&s;e u&s;urpations, was from that very power, which &s;o lately began to take place in the con&s;titu|tion. The knights of the &s;hire, who, for &s;ome time, had begun to be regularly a&s;&s;embled in a &s;eparate hou&s;e, now fir&s;t perceived tho&s;e griev|ances, which they &s;ubmitted to the &s;uperior a&s;|&s;embly of the barons for redre&s;s. The&s;e bold
<PB N="366" REF="376">
and patriotic men &s;trongly remon&s;trated again&s;t the &s;lowne&s;s of the proceedings of their twenty-four rulers; and, for the fir&s;t time, began to &s;hew that &s;pirit of ju&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, which has ever &s;ince actuated their councils in a greater or a le&s;s degree. They repre&s;ented, that though the king had performed all the conditions re|quired of him, the barons had hitherto done nothing on their part, that &s;hewed an equal re|gard for the people; that their own intere&s;ts and power &s;eemed the only aim of all their de|crees; and they even called upon the king's elde&s;t &s;on, prince Edward, to interpo&s;e his au|thority, and &s;ave the &s;inking nation.</P>
<P>Prince Edward was at this time about twenty-two years of age, when the hopes which were conceived of his abilities and his integrity ren|dered him an important per&s;onage in the tran&s;|actions of the times, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure a|toned for his father's imbecillity. Upon this occa&s;ion his conduct was fitted to impre&s;s the people with the highe&s;t idea of his piety and ju&s;tice. He alledged, when appealed to, that he had &s;worn to the late Con&s;titutions of Oxford, which, though contrary to his own private &s;en|timents, he yet re&s;olved by no means to in|fringe. At the &s;ame time, however, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the barons, requiring them to bring
<PB N="367" REF="377">
their undertaking to an end, or otherwi&s;e to ex|pect the mo&s;t vigorous oppo&s;ition to their u&s;ur|pations. To this the barons were obliged to reply, by publi&s;hing a new code of laws, which, though it contained &s;carce any thing mate|rial, yet they &s;uppo&s;ed would, for a while, dazzle the eyes of the people, until they could take mea&s;ures to confirm their authority upon a &s;ecurer foundation. In this manner, under various pretences, and &s;tudied delays, they continued them&s;elves in power for three years; while the whole nation perceived their aims, and loudly condemned their treachery. The pope him&s;elf beheld their u&s;urpations with in|dignation, and ab&s;olved the king and all his &s;ub|jects from the oath which they had taken to ob&s;erve the Provi&s;ions of Oxford.</P>
<P>The people now only wanted a leader to &s;ubvert this new tyranny impo&s;ed upon them; but they knew not where, nor whom they could apply to for &s;uccour. The king him&s;elf, weak, timid, irre&s;olute, and &s;uper&s;titious, was in a manner leagued with tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed and depre&s;&s;ed his own intere&s;ts; the clergy, who formerly gave the people redre&s;s, were become an independent body, and little concerned in the commotions of the &s;tate, which they re|garded as tame &s;pectators. In this di&s;tre&s;sful
<PB N="368" REF="378">
&s;ituation, they had recour&s;e to young prince Edward, who, at a very early age, had given the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of courage, of wi&s;dom, and of con&s;tancy. At fir&s;t, indeed, when applied to, ap|pearing &s;en&s;ible of what his father had &s;uffered by levity and breach of promi&s;e, he refu&s;ed &s;ome time to take advantage of the pope's ab&s;olu|tion, and the people's earne&s;t application; but being at la&s;t per&s;uaded to concur, a parliament was called, in which the king re&s;umed his for|mer authority; and the barons, after making one fruitle&s;s effort to take him by &s;urprize at Winche&s;ter, were obliged to acquie&s;ce in what they could not openly oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time the earl of Leice&s;ter, no way di&s;couraged by the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his pa&s;t enterprizes, re&s;olved upon entirely overturn|ing that power, which he had already humbled. For this purpo&s;e he formed a mo&s;t powerful confederacy with the prince of Wales, who in|vaded England with a body of thirty thou&s;and men. To the&s;e babarous ravagers Leice&s;ter quickly joined his own forces, and the whole kingdom was &s;oon expo&s;ed to all the deva&s;t|ations of a licentious army. The citizens of London al&s;o were not aver&s;e to his cau&s;e. Under the command of their mayor, Thomas Fitz-Richard, a furious and licentious man, they
<PB N="369" REF="379">
fell upon the Jews, and many of the more wealthy inhabitants, pillaging and de&s;troying where-ever they came. The fury of the fac|tion was not confined to London only, but broke out in mo&s;t of the populous cities of the kingdom; while the king, with his u&s;ual pu&s;illanimity, deplored the turbulence of the times, and in vain applied to the pope for his holy protection.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of the nation, nothing now remained, but an accommodation with the in&s;urgent barons; and after &s;ome time a trea|ty of peace was concluded, but upon the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous terms to the king and his par|ty.<MILESTONE N="1623" UNIT="A.D."> The Provi&s;ions of Oxford were again re|&s;tored, and the barons re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;o|vereignty of the kingdom. They took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the royal ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es; they even named the officers of the king's hou&s;hold; and &s;ummoned a parliament to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in order the more fully to &s;ettle the plan of their government. By this a&s;&s;embly it was enacted, that the autho|rity of the twenty four barons &s;hould continue; and that not only during the reign of the king, but al&s;o during that of prince Edward.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were conditions which, though the pu&s;illanimous king could very ea&s;ily &s;ub|mit to, yet the young prince would by no
<PB N="370" REF="380">
means acquie&s;ce in. He appealed to the king of France, to whom he con&s;ented to refer the &s;ubject of his infringed preten&s;ions; and when that ju&s;t monarch declared in his favour, he re&s;olved to have recour&s;e to arms, the la&s;t re|fuge of oppre&s;&s;ed royalty. Accordingly, &s;um|moning the king's military va&s;&s;als from all quarters, and being reinforced by many of the more equitable barons, he re&s;olved to take the field. His fir&s;t attempts were &s;ucce&s;sful; Northampton, Leice&s;ter, and Nottingham, &s;ub|mitted to his power; and he proceeded into the county of Derby, in order to ravage with fire and &s;word the e&s;tates of &s;uch as had e&s;pou&s;ed the oppo&s;ite cau&s;e. On the other &s;ide, the earl of Leice&s;ter was be&s;ieging Roche&s;ter, when he was informed of the king's &s;ucce&s;&s;es; upon which he rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retreated to London, where he was joined by a body of the citizens, amounting to fifteen thou&s;and men. Both armies being thus pretty near equal, they re&s;olved to come to an engage|ment, and Leice&s;ter halted within about two miles from Lewes in Su&s;&s;ex; offering, at the &s;ame time, terms of accommodation, which he well knew the king would reject. Upon the refu&s;al of the&s;e with contempt, both &s;ides prepared for a battle with the utmo&s;t rancour and animo&s;ity. The earl advanced with his
<PB N="371" REF="381">
troops near Lewes, where the king had drawn up his forces to give him a proper reception. The royal army was formed in three divi&s;ions; prince Edward commanded on the right; Richard, the king's brother, who had been &s;ome time before made king of the Romans, was po&s;ted on the left wing, and Henry him|&s;elf remained in the center. The earl's army was divided into four bodies; the fir&s;t was con|ducted by Henry de Montfort, &s;on of the ge|neral; the &s;econd was commanded by the earl of Glouce&s;ter; the third was under the com|mand of the earl him&s;elf; and the fourth, con|&s;i&s;ting of Londoners, was under the direction of Nicholas Seagrave. To encourage the&s;e in&s;urgents &s;till farther, the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter gave a general ab&s;olution to their party; ac|companied with a&s;&s;urances, that if any of them fell in the action, they would infallibly be re|ceived into heaven, as a reward for their &s;uf|fering in &s;o meritorious a cau&s;e. The battle was begun by prince Edward, who ru&s;hed upon the Londoners, placed foremo&s;t in the po&s;t of honour, with &s;o much fury, that they were unable to &s;u&s;tain the charge, but giving way, fled with great precipitation. The prince, tran&s;ported with a de&s;ire of revenging the in|&s;ults they had offered to his mother, pur&s;ued them four miles off the field of battle, cau&s;ing
<PB N="372" REF="382">
a terrible &s;laughter. While he was making this imprudent u&s;e of his victory, the earl of Leice&s;ter, who was a &s;kilful commander, pu&s;hed with all his forces again&s;t the ene|mies left wing, &s;oon put them to the route, and took both the king and his brother pri|&s;oners. It was a dreadful pro&s;pect, therefore, to the young prince, who was now returning victorious from the pur&s;uit, to behold the field covered with the bodies of his friends; and &s;till more, when he heard that his father and his uncle were defeated and taken. In this deplorable &s;tate, he at fir&s;t endeavoured to in|&s;pire his remaining troops with ardour; but being artfully amu&s;ed by Leice&s;ter with a pre|tended negotiation, he quickly found his lit|tle body of troops &s;urrounded, and he him&s;elf obliged to &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms as the conque|ror thought fit to impo&s;e. The&s;e were &s;hort, and very conformable to his wretched &s;itua|tion. He, together with another general named Henry d'Almain, were to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners, as pledges in the place of the king and his brother, who were to be relea&s;ed. The Provi&s;ions of Oxford were to continue in full force; but to be revi&s;ed by &s;ix Frenchmen, appointed by the king of France; three pre|lates, and three noblemen, who, with three more of their own chu&s;ing, were to be inve&s;ted
<PB N="373" REF="383">
with full powers to &s;ettle all di&s;turbances that then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. Such was the convention called the <HI>Mi&s;e</HI> of Lewes.</P>
<P>The&s;e great advantages were no &s;ooner ob|tained, than Leice&s;ter re&s;olved to po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf of that power,<MILESTONE N="1264" UNIT="A.D."> for which he had &s;o long been &s;truggling. In&s;tead of referring the &s;ub|ject in di&s;pute to the king of France, as was agreed on, he kept Richard &s;till a pri&s;oner; and though he had already confined prince Ed|ward in the ca&s;tle of Dover, yet he effectually took care &s;till to the king continue al&s;o in bondage. To add to his inju&s;tice, he made u&s;e of his name for purpo&s;es the mo&s;t prejudi|cial to the royal intere&s;ts; and while he every where di&s;armed the king's adherents, he was cautiou&s;ly &s;een to keep his partizans in a po&s;|ture of defence. The king, a poor contemptible &s;pectator of his own degradation, was carried about from place to place, and obliged to give his governors directions to deliver their ca&s;|tles into the hands of his enemy. To this u&s;urpation of the king's authority, Leice&s;ter added the mo&s;t barefaced and rapacious ava|rice. He &s;eized the e&s;tates of no le&s;s than eighteen barons, as his &s;hare of the &s;poil gain|ed in the battle of Lewes. He engro&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf the ran&s;om of all the pri&s;oners; he monopolized the &s;ale of wool to foreign mar|kets;
<PB N="374" REF="384">
and to fix him&s;elf compleatly in autho|rity, he ordained that all power &s;hould be ex|erci&s;ed by a council of nine per&s;ons, who were to be cho&s;en by three per&s;ons, or the majority of them; and the&s;e were the earl him&s;elf, the earl of Glouce&s;ter, and the bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter.</P>
<P>In this &s;tretch of power, Leice&s;ter was not &s;o entirely &s;ecure, but that he &s;till feared the combinations of the foreign &s;tates again&s;t him, as well as the internal machinations of the royal party. The king of France, at the in|terce&s;&s;ion of the queen of England, who had taken refuge at his court, actually prepared to rein&s;tate Henry in his dominions; the pope was not &s;paring in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures; and there were many other princes that pitied the royal &s;ufferings, and &s;ecretly wi&s;hed the u&s;ur|per's fall. The mi&s;erable &s;ituation of the king|dom in the end produced the happine&s;s of po&s;te|rity. Leice&s;ter, to &s;ecure his ill-acquired power, was obliged to have recour&s;e to an aid till now entirely unknown in England, namely, that of the body of the people. He called a par|liament, where, be&s;ides the barons of his own party, and &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were not immediate tenants of the crown, he ordered returns to be made of two knights from every &s;hire; and al&s;o deputies from the burroughs, which had been hitherto con&s;idered as too in|con&s;iderable
<PB N="375" REF="385">
to have a voice in legi&s;lation.<MILESTONE N="Jan. 20. 1265." UNIT="A.D. "> This is the fir&s;t confirmed outline of an Eng|li&s;h hou&s;e of commons. The people had been gaining &s;ome con&s;ideration &s;ince the gradual diminution of the force of the feudal &s;y&s;tem. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of corporation charters, by which many of the ru&s;tic &s;laves were in a ca|pacity of re&s;cuing them&s;elves from the power of their ma&s;ters, encrea&s;ed not only the power of the people, but their ardour to be free. As arts encrea&s;ed, the number of the&s;e little in|dependent republics, if they may be &s;o called, increa&s;ed in proportion; and we find them, at the pre&s;ent period, of con&s;equence enough to be adopted into a &s;hare of the legi&s;lature. Such was the beginning of an in&s;titution, that has &s;ince been the guardian of Briti&s;h liberty, and the admiration of mankind. In this man|ner it owed its original to the a&s;piring aims of an haughty baron, who flattered the people with the name of freedom, with a de&s;ign the more completely to tyrannize.</P>
<P>A parliament a&s;&s;embled in this manner, to &s;econd the views of the earl, was found not &s;o very complying as he expected. Many of the barons, who had hitherto &s;tedfa&s;tly adhered to his party, appeared di&s;gu&s;ted at his immode|rate ambition; and many of the people, who found that a change of ma&s;ters was not a
<PB N="376" REF="386">
change from mi&s;ery to happine&s;s, began to wi&s;h for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the royal fa|mily. In this exigence, Leice&s;ter finding him|&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e the concurring wi&s;hes of the nation, was re&s;olved to make a merit of what he could not prevent; and he accord|ingly relea&s;ed prince Edward from confine|ment, and had him introduced at We&s;tmin|&s;ter hall, where his freedom was confirm|ed by the unanimous voice of the barons. But though Leice&s;ter, had all the populari|ty of re&s;toring the prince, yet he was politic enough to keep him &s;till guarded by his emi&s;|&s;aries, who watched all his motions, and fru|&s;trated all his aims.</P>
<P>On the other hand, prince Edward, who had too much penetration not to perceive that he was made the tool of Leice&s;ter's ambition, ardently watched an opportunity to regain that freedom, of which he then enjoyed but the ap|pearance. An opportunity &s;oon offered for pro|curing him a re&s;toration of his former liberty with his power. The duke of Glouce&s;ter, one of the heads of Leice&s;ter's party, being di&s;content|ed at that nobleman's great power, retired from court in di&s;gu&s;t, and went, for &s;afety, to his e&s;tates on the borders of Wales. Leice&s;ter was not &s;low in pur&s;uing him thither; and to give greater authority to his arms, carried the
<PB N="377" REF="387">
king and the prince of Wales along with him. This was the happy opportunity that young Ed|ward long wanted in order to effect his e&s;cape. Being furni&s;hed by the earl of Glouce&s;ter with an hor&s;e of extraordinary &s;wiftne&s;s, under a pretence of taking the air with &s;ome of Leice&s;ter's re|tinue, who were in reality appointed to guard him, he propo&s;ed that they &s;hould run their hor&s;es one again&s;t the other. When he perceiv|ed that he had thus &s;ufficiently tired their hor&s;es, immediately mounting Glouce&s;ter's hor&s;e that was &s;till fre&s;h, he bid his attendants very politely farewel. They followed him indeed for &s;ometime; but the appearance of a body of troops belong|ing to Glouce&s;ter &s;oon put an end to the pur&s;uit. This happy event &s;eemed the &s;ignal for the whole body of the royali&s;ts to ri&s;e. The well known valour of the young prince, the long train of grievances which the people endured; and the countenance of the earl of Glouce&s;ter, a man of great power, all combined to encrea&s;e their numbers, and in&s;pire their activity. An army was &s;oon a&s;&s;embled which Leice&s;ter had no power to with&s;tand; and he &s;aw his hard-earned power every day ravi&s;hed from him, without being able to &s;trike a &s;ingle blow in its de|fence. His &s;on, attempting to bring him a reinforcement of troops from London, was, by a vigorous march of young Edward, &s;ur|prized, and his army cut to pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="388">It was not long after, that the earl him&s;elf, ignorant of his &s;on's fate, pa&s;&s;ed the Severne, in expectation of the London army; but in|&s;tead of the troops he expected, he &s;oon per|ceived, that the indefatigable prince was com|ing up to give him battle. Nor was it without a &s;tratagem that his little army was a&s;&s;aulted. While the prince led a part of his troops by a circuit to attack him behind, he ordered ano|ther body of them to advance with the banners of the London army that was ju&s;t defeated, which, for a long time, the earl mi&s;took for an actual reinforcement, and made di&s;po&s;itions acccrdingly. At la&s;t, however, this proud but unfortunate general, perceived his mi&s;take; and &s;aw that the enemy was advancing again&s;t him on all &s;ides, with the mo&s;t regular di&s;|po&s;ition and determined bravery. He now, therefore, found that all was lo&s;t; and was &s;o &s;truck with di&s;may, that he could not help ex|claiming, <Q REND="inline">"The Lord have mercy upon our &s;ouls, for our bodies are doomed to de&s;truc|tion."</Q> He did not, however, abandon all hopes of &s;afety; but drew up his men in a compact circle, and exhorted them to fight like men who had all to gain or all to &s;uffer. At the &s;ame time, he obliged the old king to put on armour, and to fight again&s;t his own cau&s;e, in the front of the army. The battle
<PB N="379" REF="389">
&s;oon began; but the earl's army having been exhau&s;ted by famine on the mountains of Wales, were but ill able to &s;u&s;tain the impetu|o&s;ity of young Edward's attack, who bore down upon them with incredible fury. Du|ring this terrible day, Leice&s;ter behaved with a&s;toni&s;hing intrepidity; and kept up the &s;pirit of the action from two o'clock in the afternoon, till nine at night. At la&s;t, his hor&s;e being kill|ed under him, he was compelled to fight on foot; and tho' he demanded quarter, the adver&s;e par|ty refu&s;ed it, with a barbarity common enough in the times we are de&s;cribing. The old king, who was placed in the front of the battle, was &s;oon wounded in the &s;houlder; and not being known by his friends, he was on the point of being killed by a &s;oldier; but crying out, I am Henry of Winche&s;ter the king, he was &s;aved by a knight of the royal army. Prince Edward hear|ing the voice of his father, in&s;tantly ran to the &s;pot where he lay, and had him conducted to a place of &s;afety. The body of Leice&s;ter being found among the dead, was barbarou&s;ly mang|led by one Roger Mortimer; and then, with an accumulation of inhumanity, &s;ent to the wretched widow, as a te&s;timony of the royal party's &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This victory proved deci&s;ive; and tho&s;e who were formerly per&s;ecuted, now be|came
<PB N="380" REF="390">
oppre&s;&s;ors in their turn. The king, who was grown vindictive from his &s;ufferings, was now re&s;olved to take a &s;ignal vengeance on the citizens of London, who had ever for|warded the intere&s;ts of his opponents. In this exigence, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was their only re&s;ource; and Henry was hardly prevailed upon from totally de&s;troying the city. He was at la&s;t contented to deprive it of its military en|&s;igns and fortifications, and to levy upon the inhabitants a very heavy contribution. Fitz-Richard,<MILESTONE N="1265. Aug. 5." UNIT="A.D."> the &s;editious mayor, was impri&s;oned, and purcha&s;ed his pardon with the lo&s;s of his &s;ub&s;tance. The rebels every were &s;ubmitted, or were pur&s;ued with rigour. Their ca&s;tles were taken and demoli&s;hed; and &s;carce any were found that di&s;puted the king's authori|ty. Among the few who &s;till continued re|fractory, was one Adam Gordon, formerly go|venor of Dun&s;ter ca&s;tle, and very much cele|brated for his prodigious &s;trength, and great bravery. This courageous baron maintained him&s;elf for &s;ome time in the fore&s;ts of Hamp|&s;hire, and ravaged the counties of Berks and Surrey. Prince Edward was, at length, obli|ged to lead a body of troops into that part of the country to force him from thence; and at|tacked his camp with great bravery. Being tran&s;ported with the natural impetuo&s;ity of
<PB N="381" REF="391">
youth, and the ardour of the action, he leapt over the trench, by which it was defended, attend|ed by a few followers; and thus found him&s;elf unexpectedly cut off from the re&s;t of his army. Gordon &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the re&s;t of his attendants; and a &s;ingle combat began be|tween the&s;e two valiant men, which, for a long time, continued doubtful. But the prince's for|tune at la&s;t prevailed: Adam's foot happening to &s;lip, he received a wound, which di&s;abled him from continuing the action, and he remained at the mercy of the conqueror. Edward was as mer|ciful as he was brave; he not only granted him his life, but introduced him that very night to his con&s;ort at Guilford; procured him his par|don and e&s;tate, and received him into favour. Gordon was not ungrateful for &s;uch mercy; he ever after followed the prince; and was of|ten found combating by his &s;ide in the mo&s;t dangerous &s;hock of battle. In this manner, the genero&s;ity of the prince tempered the in&s;o|lence of victory; and &s;trength was gradually re&s;tored to the different members of the con&s;ti|tution, that had been &s;o long weakened by the continuance of civil di&s;cord.</P>
<P>Edward having thus re&s;tored peace to the kingdom, found his affairs now &s;o firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, that it was not in the power of any &s;light di&s;gu&s;t taken by the licentious barons
<PB N="382" REF="392">
to &s;hake them. The earl of Glouce&s;ter, indeed, who had been &s;o in&s;trumental in re&s;toring the king to the crown, thought that no recom|pence could equal his merits. He therefore engaged once more in open rebellion; but was &s;oon brought to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by the prince, who obliged him to enter into a bond of twenty thou&s;and marks, never to enter into &s;imilar &s;chemes for the future. The kingdom being thus tolerably compo&s;ed, that &s;pirit of adventure and ardour for military glory, which &s;hone forth in all this prince's actions, now impelled him to undertake the expedition again&s;t the in|fidels in the Holy Land. The cru&s;ade was at that time the great object of ambition; all other wars were con&s;idered as trifling, and all other &s;ucce&s;&s;es as mean, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e gained over the enemies of Chri&s;t and his re|ligion. To that renowned field of blood flocked all the brave, the pious, the ambitious, and the powerful.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution, which, tho' &s;ucceeding fa&s;hions of thinking have condemn|ed, yet certainly then was pro&s;ecuted upon the noble&s;t motives. Edward &s;ailed from England with a large army, and arrived at the camp of Lewis, the king of France, which lay before Tu|nis; and where he had the misfortune to hear of that good monarch's death before his arrival. The
<PB N="383" REF="393">
prince, however, no way di&s;couraged by this event, continued his voyage, and arrived at the Holy Land in &s;afety.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce departed upon this pious expe|dition, when the health of the old king began to decline; and he found not only his own con&s;ti|tution, but al&s;o that of the &s;tate, in &s;uch a dan|gerous &s;ituation, that he wrote letters to his &s;on, pre&s;&s;ing him to return with all di&s;patch. The former calamities began to threaten the kingdom again; and the barons, taking ad|vantage of the king's weakne&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ed the people with impunity. Bands of robbers in|fe&s;ted various parts of the nation; and the po|pulace of London once more re&s;umed their ac|cu&s;tomed licentiou&s;ne&s;s. To add to the king's unea&s;ine&s;s, his brother Richard died, who had long a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with his advice in all emer|gencies. He therefore, ardently wi&s;hed for the return of his gallant &s;on, who had placed the &s;ceptre in hands that were too feeble to hold it. At la&s;t overcome by the cares of go|vernment, and the infirmities of age, he order|ed him&s;elf to be removed, by ea&s;y journies, from St. Edmund's to We&s;tmin&s;ter, where, &s;ending for the earl of Glouce&s;ter, he obliged him to &s;wear that he would pre&s;erve the peace of the kingdom; and, to the utmo&s;t of his power, maintain the intere&s;ts of his &s;on. That
<PB N="384" REF="394">
&s;ame night be expired, and the next morning the great &s;eal was delivered to the archbi&s;hop of York, and the lords of the privy-council.</P>
<P>Thus died Henry, in the &s;ixty-fourth year of his age, and the fifty-&s;ixth of his reign, the longe&s;t to be met with in the Engli&s;h annals. He was a prince more adapted for pri|vate than for public life; his ea&s;e, &s;impli|city, and good nature, would have &s;ecured him that happine&s;s in a lower &s;tation, of which they deprived him upon a throne. How|ever, from his calamities, the people after|wards derived the mo&s;t permanent ble&s;&s;ings; that liberty which they extorted from his weak|ne&s;s they continued to pre&s;erve under bolder princes, who &s;ucceeded him. The flame of free|dom had now diffu&s;ed it&s;elf from the incorpo|rated towns through the whole ma&s;s of the peo|ple, and ever afterwards blazed forth at con|venient &s;ea&s;ons; &s;o that in proportion as the upper orders lo&s;t, the people were &s;ure to be gainers. In this conte&s;t, though they often laid down their lives, and &s;uffered all the calamities of civil war, yet tho&s;e calamities were con&s;i|dered as nothing, when weighed again&s;t the ad|vantages of freedom and &s;ecurity.</P>
