<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Sermon, not originally de&s;ign'd for the Pre&s;s, is publi&s;h'd in Compliance with the earne&s;t Reque&s;t of a few partial Hearers, with whom the intere&s;ting Nature of the Subject &s;up|plied every Deficiency in the Performance: The Author meant it, not as a Proof of his Abilities, but as a Te&s;timony of his Affection; and as &s;uch, &s;ubmits it with all Deference to the Indulgence of the Public.</P>

<HEAD><BIBL>II. CHRON. c. xxxii. v. 33.</BIBL> <Q><HI>And</HI> Hezekiah <HI>&s;lept with his Fathers; and all</HI> Judah, <HI>and the Inhabitants of</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>did him Honour at his Death.</HI></Q></HEAD>
<P><HI>HEZEKIAH,</HI> King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> was one of tho&s;e few illu&s;trious Sovereigns recorded in Holy Writ to have <HI>done Right in the Sight of the Lord;</HI> one, who by his Example influenced, and by his Authority reformed a corrupt and &s;inful Nation: <HI>he wrought that,</HI> &s;ays the &s;acred Hi&s;tory, <HI>which was good and right, and Truth before the Lord his God, and in every Work that he began in the Service of the Hou&s;e of God, and in the Laws and in the Commandments to &s;eek his God, he did it with all his Heart, and pro&s;pered.</HI></P>
<P>THE Con&s;equence of &s;uch Conduct and &s;uch Succe&s;s was what might naturally be expected from it: his Piety and Goodne&s;s, his Ju&s;tice and Benevolence &s;o gain'd upon the
<PB N="4" REF="6">
Hearts and Affections of a grateful People as to render him the Object of univer&s;al E&s;teem, Love, and Admiration, in&s;o|much that when he died, every Heart was depre&s;&s;ed with Sorrow, and every Eye was wet with Tears; the whole Nation lamented their Lo&s;s with unfeigned Sincerity, they wept for him as a Father, they mourned for him as a Friend, <HI>and all</HI> Judah, <HI>and the Inhabitants of</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>did him Honour at his Death.</HI></P>
<P>A Te&s;timony, &s;o full and ample, of exalted Merit on the one Hand, and extraordinary Gratitude on the other, reflects Honour on the Prince, who de&s;erved, and on the People, who be&s;towed it: Ble&s;&s;ings, no doubt, which a Nation re|ceives, a Nation &s;hould pay; and Grief, which is univer&s;ally felt, &s;hould be as univer&s;ally expre&s;&s;ed: the Circum&s;tance before us is &s;uch, as would, at any Time, affect us, but at this, mu&s;t demand our immediate Application.</P>
<P>THE late &s;udden and dreadful Calamity, which hath fallen on the&s;e Kingdoms, by the Death of our ever-honoured and beloved Sovereign, hath &s;pread univer&s;al Sorrow over his afflicted People.</P>
<P>WHEN private Individuals pay the Debt of Nature, it affects, and deeply perhaps, a few unhappy Dependants; the Grief, that ari&s;es, &s;preads only through the &s;mall Circle of Kindred and Relations; and the Tears, which are &s;hed, flow within the narrow Channel of dome&s;tic Friend&s;hip; but when Death &s;elects a royal Victim, when he adorns his Tri|umph with Thrones and Scepters, when the Kings and great
<PB N="5" REF="7">
Ones of the Earth &s;ink into the Grave, when <HI>the mighty fall,</HI> and are no more, the Blow is felt, as it were, on every Side, and Thou&s;ands fall beneath it: the Influence of &s;uch Planets is &s;o wide and diffu&s;ive, that the Eclip&s;e is felt by whole Nations; a People puts on Sackcloth, and a Kingdom mourneth.</P>
<P>CIRCUMSTANCES indeed will &s;ometimes happen, by the Intervention of Providence, that may render the Weight le&s;s heavy, and the Calamity le&s;s dreadful; &s;uch is the happy and envied State of <HI>Britain</HI> under her pre&s;ent Affliction; but God forbid that tho&s;e Things, which &s;hould heighten our Grati|tude, and enhance our Affection to the be&s;t of Kings, &s;hould le&s;&s;en and dimini&s;h them. To the Care and Conduct, to the paternal Love and Tenderne&s;s of our departed Sovereign are we indebted, in a great Mea&s;ure, for our Succe&s;s and Pro&s;|perity; the greater Rea&s;on therefore we have to be ea&s;y and happy, with the greater Regret &s;hould we lament him who made us &s;o. The grief, which we feel at his Lo&s;s, is the only Grief, which he ever gave us; and the Tears, which flow at his Decea&s;e, are the fir&s;t, which he hath cau&s;ed us to &s;hed; &s;urely then, all the little Te&s;timony, which we can give of our unfeigned Grief, and all the Honours, which <HI>the Inha|bitants of our</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>can do him at his Death,</HI> are but a poor Tribute to his Memory, in Return for &s;o many Years of his gracious Favour and Protection.</P>
<P>HE is now removed, by the divine Will, far above all the Cares, and all the Plea&s;ures of Mortality; above Cen&s;ure, and
<PB N="6" REF="8">
above Prai&s;e; removed to a Place, where only his Virtues can be truly known, and thoroughly rewarded; to a Place, where all the little Honours, which we can pay to his Memory, are but as Du&s;t in the ballance compared with that divine Fa|vour, which &s;hall recompen&s;e him; and that Applau&s;e, which he &s;hall receive from the King of Kings; and yet, if the Souls of good Men departed have Knowledge of what pa&s;&s;eth here be|low, his, no doubt, will look down with tender Complacency on the unfeigned Sorrows, and grateful Remembrances of his beloved People.</P>
<P>THINGS, which we have been long attached to, even though of an indifferent Nature, and from which neither Plea&s;ure nor Advantage, in any great Degree, can be expected, we yet can|not part from without Regret; but when a Sovereign and his People have been long and clo&s;ely united, by the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of mutual Love and Affection, when every Fear is bani&s;hed, and every Jealou&s;y removed, when many Years Experience have convinced them that they are happy in, that they were made for each other, &s;uch a Separation is generally a fatal, always a melancholy Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>THERE are in human Nature various Qualities and Perfec|tions, adapted to the various Ranks, Circum&s;tances, Stations and Conditions of this Life; and that, which would be u&s;eful and beneficial in one, would only be de&s;tructive and pernicious in another; that Wit and Vivacity, which would recommend a private Companion, would only demean and di&s;grace a pub|lic Character; and that Ambition, which would immortalize
<PB N="7" REF="9">
a General or State&s;man, would only make a Sovereign mi&s;er|able, and involve a Nation in Ruin. Piety, Ju&s;tice, Tem|perance and Benevolence, are the brighte&s;t Jewels that adorn a Crown, and all the&s;e &s;hone lately with di&s;tingai&s;hed Lu&s;tre in the Briti&s;h Diadem.</P>
<P>FEW Kings, we know, de&s;erve the Love of their People; and &s;till fewer perhaps fully experience or enjoy it. The mo&s;t loyal Subjects may not have Opportunities to &s;hew their Loy|alty, and the mo&s;t affectionate may not meet with any to &s;hew their Affection; but WE may all remember the Time when the Loyalty and Affection of <HI>England</HI> were put to the Te&s;t: At that Time with what Zeal and Unanimity did the People ri&s;e up as one Man, to vindicate, with their own, the Rights of their injured Sovereign! That filial Love, which glowed in the Brea&s;t of <HI>Culloden</HI>'s Hero, &s;eemed to &s;pread it&s;elf through the whole Nation. He had acted as a Father to us, and we, as Sons, united to defend him. From that Hour, to the la&s;t fatal one, which tore him from us, never did Diffi|dence, Di&s;gu&s;t, or Di&s;cord &s;ully his au&s;picious Reign; mutual Confidence e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf between Prince and People, Obe|dience ripened into Love, and Duty &s;oftened into Affection: Every Year added &s;trength to the Chains of Harmony, which nothing but Death could ever have di&s;united. Shall we not then &s;et apart a few Minutes for the Remembrance of him, to whom we owe &s;o many Years of uninterrupted Felicity?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
THOSE, who are confined within the humbler Sphere of Action, and walk as it were in the lowly Vale of Life, enter|tain very fal&s;e and inadequate Ideas of what pa&s;&s;es above them; we &s;ee the Pomp and Pageantry attendant on the Great, but are Strangers to their Cares and Anxieties: &s;uperior Rank and Title bring with them &s;uperior Toils and Labours; and Kings, though the greate&s;t, are by no means therefore the happie&s;t of Mankind, as he, who lately filled the Throne of the&s;e Kingdoms did him&s;elf, no doubt, often and fully experience: Convinced that Indu&s;try was nece&s;&s;ary in the Performance of every Office, and above all in the highe&s;t, he was him&s;elf the noble&s;t Example of it: He never thought that the Eminency of his Station exempted him from the Duties of a Man, or that the Splendor of a Crown could dimini&s;h the Weight of it: He applied him&s;elf to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his exalted Rank with unwearied Diligence, even in the Decline of Life pur&s;ued it with a Vigour and Activity, which would have done Honour to Youth, and gave as little Time to Amu&s;e|ment and Relaxation as the meane&s;t of his Subjects.</P>
<P>The Welfare and Happine&s;s of <HI>England</HI> were indeed his chief and perpetual Concern; if his Indu&s;try and A&s;&s;iduity were by any thing exceeded, it was by his Benevolence: Ever anxious for the Good and Happine&s;s of his Subjects, he &s;uffered no private Cares and Anxieties to interrupt the public Bu&s;ine&s;s, or to retard the public Good. That Length of Days, which was &s;o beneficial to us, brought heavy Calamities on him&s;elf, and oppre&s;&s;ed him with dome&s;tic Sorrows, which bore hard upon his declining Age. Many of tho&s;e, whom he loved and
<PB N="9" REF="11">
e&s;teemed, were &s;natched away from him, and many of his beloved Children dropped into the Grave before him: But amid&s;t all his Cares and Sorrows he was &s;till attentive to the Duties of a King; the Misfortunes of his Country always affected and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him equally with his own: his la&s;t Wi&s;hes were for the Happine&s;s of his Kingdoms, and his la&s;t Prayers for the Peace of his <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>NEVER, perhaps, were Ju&s;tice and Judgment more duly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly admini&s;tered than in the late au&s;picious Reign. The Power of Life and Death, entru&s;ted to the King as &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, could not have been lodged in a more equal Hand: Unbia&s;&s;ed by private Favour, and uninfluenced by partial Attachments, he held the Scales with un&s;haken Firmne&s;s, and di&s;pen&s;ed Rewards and Puni&s;hments with the &s;tricte&s;t Regard to Truth and Equity: Whenever the Laws of Humanity, as well as of his Country, were trampled on by the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and the Murtherer, by Crimes that deeply affected the Community, he permitted no Interce&s;&s;ion, how powerful &s;oever, to avert the Sword of Ju&s;tice; and, above all, if at any Time his injured People demanded a Victim for the Violation of Public Tru&s;t, then would he not &s;uffer any ill-exerted Solicitation to &s;creen the guilty Delinquent. Mercy, notwith|&s;tanding, (for the Ju&s;t are always the mo&s;t humane) was the con&s;tant Inmate of his royal Brea&s;t: Whenever Crimes admitted of Alleviation, whenever Circum&s;tances &s;oftened the Offence, or Merit pleaded for the Offender, he readily and chearfully extended his Pardon. So great, and &s;o remarkable were his Tenderne&s;s and Humanity to the Unfortunate, that he always
<PB N="10" REF="12">
pitied, even when he could not forgive, and lamented the Man, whil&s;t he puni&s;hed the Criminal.</P>
<P>IT would be highly injurious to his Character, not to ob|&s;erve on this Occa&s;ion, that the &s;ame love of Ju&s;tice, which actuated his Brea&s;t as a Magi&s;trate, directed his Conduct al&s;o as a King: Never, during the Cour&s;e of his Reign, did he draw the Sword but in her cau&s;e; never did he think him&s;elf at liberty, as too many of his Predece&s;&s;ors have, to exhau&s;t the Trea&s;ures, and &s;pill the Blood of his Subjects in fruitle&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary Wars, to &s;atisfy the Cravings of Avarice, or to &s;ooth the Madne&s;s of Ambition; nobler were the Purpo&s;es, which he had to &s;erve, and higher the Ambition, which he de&s;ired to gratify; to defend his own Kingdoms, to a&s;&s;ert his own Rights, to repre&s;s the Pride of the In&s;olent, and &s;upport the Cau&s;e of the Injured and Oppre&s;&s;ed: In this Cau&s;e he fought, and in this he conquered: <HI>The Almighty was on his Side,</HI> and who could with&s;tand him? <HI>God went forth with his Fleets and Ar|mies, the mo&s;t High did mightily defend him.</HI></P>
<P>A CONDUCT thus noble and di&s;intere&s;ted, a Behaviour thus candid and upright, &s;ufficiently pointed out the Spring, which actuated every Motion; his Manners &s;poke his Religion, his Practice bore Te&s;timony to his Faith, and his Actions proved them&s;elves the genuine Offspring of Chri&s;tianity: Such a Tree alone could produce &s;uch Fruit; Waters &s;o pure and untainted could flow from no other Fountain.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
AMONGST all the Titles of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarch, that of Defender of the Faith is doubtle&s;s one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious; a Title, which whil&s;t it gives him the Power to promote the Honour and Glory of God, is at the &s;ame Time the be&s;t Support of his own Authority, and the be&s;t Guardian of his own Prerogative: the Intere&s;t of Church and State, in our ex|cellent Con&s;titution, are &s;o intimately blended and united, as to convince every wi&s;e and good King, that they are truly and e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame; and yet, how often hath the Want of this Conviction been fatal both to Prince and People? Our late Sovereign was too &s;incere a Friend to the Faith, which he profe&s;s'd, too worthy a follower of it's Doctrines, to neglect the &s;acred Charge committed to his Care; to neg|lect a Charge, on the due Performance of which, he well knew the Stability of his Throne, and the Happine&s;s of his Kingdoms &s;o immediately depended. Never did the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Prote&s;tant E&s;tabli&s;hment, boa&s;t a warmer Advocate, or a more zealous Defender; Vice dreaded his Power, Virtue experienced his Protection, Religion felt his Influence: if, during his long and illu&s;trious Reign, <HI>England</HI> was &s;ometimes unfortunate, and oftener guilty; if evil Coun|&s;els did at any Time (and where is it that they do not &s;ome|times?) prevail; the &s;ober and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Part of his Sub|jects knew too well who were to blame, to attribute it to their noble Ma&s;ter; who &s;ubmitted but to Evils, which he could not prevent; and &s;uffer'd by Mea&s;ures, which he could not approve.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
IN a Word; to &s;um up his Character without Flattery and without Exaggeration, he was, what one of the noble&s;t of our Poets calls, <HI>the noble&s;t Work of God, an hone&s;t Man;</HI> in him, Ju&s;tice hath lo&s;t an able Defender, Truth an Advocate, Religion a Friend; his Servants lament a generous Ma&s;ter, his Children the tendere&s;t Father, his Country the be&s;t of Kings.</P>
<P>GOD, in Reward of his Merit on Earth, ble&s;&s;ed him with Length of Days; be&s;towed on him the Dignity, the Autho|rity, and Privileges of Age, without the Weakne&s;&s;es and Infirmities of it. The Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life was to make <HI>England</HI> happy and &s;ucce&s;sful; and Providence, which is ever gracious to this unworthy Nation, would not interrupt him in &s;o glorious a Work; the Almighty knew the Wi&s;h of his Soul, and ble&s;&s;ed him with it.</P>
<P>HE lived to &s;ee Corruption, which unknown to and unli|cenced by him had well nigh e&s;tabli&s;h'd it&s;elf, deba&s;ed and degraded; to &s;ee tho&s;e de&s;tructive Principles, which had long been undermining the Con&s;titution, detected and de&s;troyed; he lived to &s;ee a Spirit of Freedom, Courage, Hone&s;ty and Activity, breathe throughout the whole Nation; to &s;ee <HI>Britain</HI> emerge from a State of Lethargy, Sloth and Contempt, to Strength and manly Vigour; to &s;ee her &s;hine once more in her native Lu&s;tre, rea&s;&s;ume her antient Dominion, and give Law to the Nations around her; he lived to &s;ee Faction &s;ub|dued, to &s;ee all the hydra Heads of Party cut off, and it's very
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Name obliterated from among&s;t us; to &s;ee that wor&s;t of Mon&s;ters chain'd down by national Union, and buried, we hope, at la&s;t, in eternal Oblivion.</P>
<P>THE Lord hath indeed done great Things for us, how &s;hall we recompen&s;e him for them? We have payed our la&s;t melancholy Duty, <HI>and all</HI> Judah <HI>and</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>have done him Honour at his Death.</HI> Let us then turn our Eyes from the &s;olemn, mournful Scene, towards a fairer, and a brighter Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame gracious Providence, which continued a Life &s;o precious, beyond it's common Limits for our Sakes, hath extended it&s;elf &s;till farther, by pre&s;erving another no le&s;s dear, or le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to our Happine&s;s, that of his illu&s;trious Succe&s;&s;or: there is not perhaps a Nation on Earth, except our own, who&s;e Sovereign's Death would not be attended with mo&s;t fatal Con&s;equences to the public Weal; who&s;e Mea&s;ures new Parties would not di&s;concert; who&s;e Plans new Mini&s;ters would not change; who&s;e Unanimity, Di&s;cord and Divi&s;ion, would not loo&s;en and di&s;&s;olve: but this, we tru&s;t and believe, will not be our Misfortune; the &s;ame Sun, which &s;o lately &s;et in Glory, &s;eemeth to ri&s;e upon us with Rays of added Lu&s;tre: the be&s;t and noble&s;t Part of him, whom we lament, &s;till &s;urviveth; that patriot Soul, which animated our Councils, in&s;pired our Armies, and led us on to Victory and Pro&s;perity, is tran&s;mitted to the Heir of his Virtues and his Throne, who hath already promi&s;ed, and &s;acred is his Word, to pur&s;ue the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, to follow
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the &s;ame glorious De&s;igns, to guide him&s;elf by the &s;ame Wi&s;dom, and to tread in all the Steps of his honoured Predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Britons</HI> were to form a Wi&s;h with Regard to their future Sovereign, who&s;e Completion would &s;atisfy all their De&s;ires, what would it be? Doubtle&s;s it would be to have a King de|&s;cended from him, whom they &s;o long loved, and &s;o &s;incerely lamented; to have a King born in the Land, which he is to reign over; acquainted with tho&s;e Laws, by which he is to govern, and that Con&s;titution, which he is &s;worn to protect; to have a King, who to the active Vigour of Youth &s;hould join the &s;ober Serenity of temperate Manhood; who had im|bibed, from his earlie&s;t Years, the heartie&s;t Affection for his People, and the warme&s;t Love for his native Country; with a Mind attentive to the In&s;tructions of Wi&s;dom, and flexible to the Dictates of Experience; Liberality diffu&s;ive as his Power, and Benevolence exten&s;ive as his Dominion; an Eye intently fixed on the Intere&s;ts of <HI>Britain,</HI> and an Ear open to the Cries of the Injured, the Wants of Merit, the Complaints of Ju&s;tice, and never &s;hut but again&s;t the Voice of Flattery and Di&s;&s;imula|tion. If to this could be added al&s;o a refined Ta&s;te, and Know|ledge of tho&s;e Arts and Sciences, which &s;ue for his Influence, and demand his Protection, what might we not hope for in the World of Literature, when a Monarch &s;hould unite &s;uch Abilities to di&s;tingui&s;h Merit, and &s;uch Power to reward it? What might we not expect in the Seats of Wi&s;dom, and in the great Councils of the Nation, when &s;uch a Prince &s;hould pre&s;ide over them?</P>
<P>SUCH a King would begin his Reign with doing Honours to the excellent Sovereign, who reigned before him, and whil&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="17">
he lamented <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Maje&s;ty's Declaration.</NOTE> his own Lo&s;s, and that of the Nation, would graciou&s;ly declare his own &s;incere Attachment to his native Country, who&s;e Honour, Intere&s;t, and Happine&s;s are mo&s;t dear to him. He would begin his Reign by the Encourage|ment of Piety and Virtue, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;eriou&s;ly and religiou&s;ly con&s;ider|ing that it is his indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty to be careful, above all other things, to pre&s;erve and advance the Honour and Ser|vice of Almighty God."</Q>  <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Beginning of the Proclamation.</NOTE> How aweful is Virtue, when &s;he dictates from a Throne! How amiable is Goodne&s;s, when cloathed in the Robes of Royalty! Such a King would by his fir&s;t Appearance and Behaviour to all Ranks and Degrees of Men, conciliate the Affections of his Subjects, rai&s;e their drooping Spirits, wipe the Tear from every Eye, and di&s;pel the Angui&s;h from every Heart.</P>
<P>IF we know &s;uch a King, we know the greate&s;t Happine&s;s that a Nation can enjoy; let us put up our earne&s;t Prayers to Heaven for the continuance of it.</P>
<P>LET thy Wi&s;dom, O God, be his Guide, and thine Arm &s;trengthen him; let Ju&s;tice, Truth and Holine&s;s flouri&s;h in his Days; direct, O Lord, his Councils, and pro&s;per his En|deavours for the Glory and Welfare of this Nation; and, that we may always rejoice in thy Bounties, may the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings be continued to after Ages! Let there never be one wanting in his Hou&s;e to &s;ucceed him in the Government of the&s;e King|doms, <HI>that our Po&s;terity may &s;ee his Children's Children, and Peace upon</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>Now to God the Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
