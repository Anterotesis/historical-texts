<P>THE duke of York,<MILESTONE N="1685" UNIT="A.D."> who &s;ucceeded his brother by the title of king James the &s;econd, had been bred a papi&s;t by his mother, and was &s;trongly bigotted to his principles. It is the property of that religion almo&s;t ever to con|tract the &s;phere of the under&s;tanding; and un|til people are in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;engaged from its prejudices, it is impo&s;&s;ible to lay a ju&s;t
<PB N="2" REF="4">
claim to exten&s;ive views, or con&s;i&s;tency of de|&s;ign. The intellects of this prince were natu|rally weak; and the education he had received rendered them &s;till more feeble. He there|fore conceived the impracticable project of reigning in the arbitrary manner of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, and of changing the e&s;tabli&s;hed reli|gion of his country, at a time when his per&s;on was hated, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion pa&s;&s;ion|ately loved. The people, though they de|&s;pi&s;ed the admini&s;tration of his predece&s;&s;or, yet loved the king. They were willing to bear with the faults of one, who&s;e whole be|haviour was a continued in&s;tance of affability; but they were by no means willing to grant the &s;ame indulgence to James, as they knew him to be gloomy, proud, bigotted, and cruel.</P>
<P>His reign began with acts of imprudence. All the cu&s;toms, and the greater part of the exci&s;e, that had been voted to the late king for his life only, were levied by James, without a new act for that purpo&s;e. He likewi&s;e went openly to ma&s;s with all the en&s;igns of his dig|nity; and even &s;ent one Caryl as his agent to Rome to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the pope, and to pave the way for the re-admi&s;&s;ion of England into the bo&s;om of the catholic church. The&s;e were but inau&s;picious &s;ymptoms in the very
<PB N="3" REF="5">
beginning of his reign; but the progre&s;s no way fell &s;hort of the commencement.</P>
<P>He had, long before the commencement of his reign, had an intrigue with one Mrs. Sed|ley, whom he afterwards created counte&s;s of Dorche&s;ter; but being now told that as he was to convert his people, the &s;anctity of his manners ought to corre&s;pond with his profe&s;|&s;ions, Mrs. Sedley was di&s;carded, and he re|&s;igned him&s;elf up to the advice of the queen, who was as much governed by prie&s;ts as he. From the &s;ugge&s;tions of the&s;e men, and particularly the Je&s;uits, all mea&s;ures were taken. One day, when the Spani&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador ventured to advi&s;e his maje&s;ty again&s;t placing too much confidence in &s;uch kind of people,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it not the cu&s;tom in Spain, &s;aid James, for the king to con&s;ult with his con|fe&s;&s;or?"</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Yes, an&s;wered the amba&s;&s;ador, and that is the rea&s;on our affairs &s;ucceed &s;o very ill."</Q></P>
<P>But though his actions might &s;erve to demon&s;trate his aims, yet his fir&s;t parlia|ment, which was mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of zea|lous Tories were &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed to comply with all the mea&s;ures of the crown. They voted unanimou&s;ly that they would &s;ettle on the pre&s;ent king, during life, all the revenue
<PB N="4" REF="6">
enjoyed by the late king, until the time of his decea&s;e. For this favour, James a&s;&s;ured them of his re&s;olution to &s;ecure them in the full enjoyment of their laws; but no an&s;wer could be extorted from him with regard to religion, for that he was &s;ecretly re&s;olved to alter.</P>
<P>To pave the way for his intended conver|&s;ion of the kingdom, it was nece&s;&s;ary to unde|ceive them with regard to the late rumour of a popi&s;h plot; and Oates, the contriver, was the fir&s;t object of royal indignation. He was tried for perjury on two indictments. One, for &s;wearing that he was pre&s;ent at a con&s;ultation of Je&s;uits in London the twenty-fourth of April 1679; and another, for &s;wearing that father Ireland was in London on the begin|ning of September of the &s;ame year. He was convicted on the evidence of above two and twenty per&s;ons on the fir&s;t, and of twenty-&s;e|ven on the latter indictment. His &s;entence was to pay a fine of a thou&s;and marks on each in|dictment, to be whipped on two different days from Aldgate to Newgate, and from Newgate to Tyburn. To be impri&s;oned during life, and to be pillored five times every year. Oates, long accu&s;tomed to a life of infamy and &s;trug|gle, &s;upported him&s;elf under every puni&s;hment
<PB N="5" REF="7">
that ju&s;tice could inflict. He avowed his in|nocence, called heaven to witne&s;s to his vera|city; and he knew that there was a large party that were willing to take his word. Though the whipping was &s;o cruel, that it appeared evidently the intention of the court to put him to death by that dreadful puni&s;hment, yet Oates &s;urvived it all, and lived to king Wil|liam's reign, when he had a pen&s;ion of four hundred pounds a year &s;ettled upon him. Thus Oates remains as a &s;tain upon the times in every part of his conduct. It is a &s;tain upon them that he was fir&s;t believed, it is a &s;tain upon them that he was care&s;&s;ed, that he was tyrannically puni&s;hed, and that he was after|wards rewarded.</P>
<P>Monmouth, who had been, &s;ince his la&s;t con&s;piracy, pardoned, but ordered to depart the kingdom, had retired to Holland. Be|ing di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from thence by the prince of Orange upon James's acce&s;&s;ion, he went to Bru&s;&s;els, where finding him&s;elf &s;till pur&s;ued by the king's &s;everity, he re&s;olved to retaliate, and make an attempt upon the kingdom. He had ever been the darling of the people, and &s;ome averred that Charles had married his mo|ther, and owned Monmouth's legitimacy at his death. The duke of Argyle &s;econded his views in
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Scotland, and they formed the &s;cheme of a double in&s;urrection; &s;o that while Monmouth &s;hould attempt to make a ri&s;ing in the We&s;t, Argyle was al&s;o to try his endeavours in the North.</P>
<P>Argyle was the fir&s;t who landed in Scotland, where he publi&s;hed his manife&s;toes, put him|&s;elf at the head of two thou&s;and five hundred men,<MILESTONE N="1685" UNIT="A.D."> and &s;trove to influence the people in his cau&s;e. But a formidable body of the king's forces coming again&s;t him, his army fell away, and he him&s;elf, after being wounded in at|tempting to e&s;cape, was taken pri&s;oner by a pea&s;ant, who found him &s;tanding up to his neck in a pool of water. He was from thence carried to Edinburgh, where, after enduring many indignities with a gallant &s;pirit, he was publicly executed.</P>
<P>The fate of Argyle was but a bad encou|ragement to the unfortunate Monmouth, who was by this time landed in Dor&s;et&s;hire, with &s;carce an hundred followers. However his name was &s;o popular, and &s;o great was the hatred of the people both for the per&s;on and religion of James, that in four days he had a&s;&s;embled a body of above two thou&s;and men. They were indeed all of them the lowe&s;t of the people, and his declarations were &s;uited
<PB N="7" REF="9">
entirely to their prejudices. He called the king the duke of York, and denominated him a traitor, a tyrant, a murderer, and a popi&s;h u&s;urper. He imputed to him the fire of Lon|don, the murder of Godfrey and E&s;&s;ex, and even the poi&s;oning the late king.</P>
<P>The parliament was no &s;ooner informed of Monmouth's landing, than they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, a&s;&s;uring him of their loyal|ty, zeal, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The duke of Albemarle, rai&s;ing a body of four thou&s;and militia, advan|ced, in order to block him up in Lyme; but finding his &s;oldiers di&s;affected to the king, he &s;oon after retreated with precipitation.</P>
<P>In the mean time the duke advanced to Taunton, where he was reinforced by con&s;i|derable numbers. Twenty young maids of &s;ome rank pre&s;ented Monmouth with a pair of colours, their handy work, together with a copy of the Bible. There he a&s;&s;umed the title of king, and was proclaimed with great &s;olemni|ty. His numbers had now encrea&s;ed to &s;ix thou&s;and men; and he was obliged every day, for want of arms, to di&s;mi&s;s numbers, who crowded to his &s;tandard. He entered Bridge|water, Wells, and Frome, and was proclaimed in all tho&s;e places; but he lo&s;t the hour of action, in receiving and claiming the&s;e empty honours.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">The king was not a little alarmed at his in|va&s;ion; but &s;till more at the &s;ucce&s;s of an un|dertaking, that at fir&s;t appeared de&s;perate. Six regiments of Briti&s;h troops were called over from Holland, and a body of regulars to the number of three thou&s;and men, were &s;ent under the command of the earl of Fever|&s;ham and Churchill, to check the progre&s;s of the rebels. They took po&s;t at Sedgemore, a village in the neighbourhood of Bridgewater, and were joined by the militia of the coun|try in con&s;iderable numbers. It was there that Monmouth re&s;olved, by a de&s;perate effort, to lo&s;e his life or gain the kingdom. The negli|gent di&s;po&s;ition made by Fever&s;ham invited him to the attack; and his faithful followers &s;hew|ed what courage and principle could do again&s;t di&s;cipline and &s;uperior numbers. They drove the royal infantry from their ground, and were upon the point of gaining the victory, when the mi&s;conduct of Monmouth, and the cowardice of lord Gray, who commanded the hor&s;e, brought all to ruin. This nobleman fled at the fir&s;t on&s;et; and the rebels being charged in flank by the victorious army, gave way after a three hours conte&s;t. About three hundred were killed in the engagement, and a thou&s;and in the pur&s;uit; and thus ended an enterprize, ra&s;hly begun, and more &s;eebly conducted.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11">Monmouth fled from the field of battle above twenty miles, till his hor&s;e &s;unk under him. He then alighted, and exchanging cloaths with a &s;hepherd, fled on foot, attended by a German count, who had accompanied him from Holland. Being quite exhau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, they both lay down in a field, and covered them&s;elves with fern. The &s;hepherd being found in Monmouth's cloaths by the pur&s;uers, encrea&s;ed the diligence of the &s;earch; and, by the means of blood hounds, he was detected in his mi&s;erable &s;ituation, with raw pea&s;e in his pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to &s;u&s;tain life. He bur&s;t into tears when &s;eized by his enemies; and petitioned, with the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, for life. He wrote the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters to the king; and that monarch, willing to fea&s;t his eyes with the mi&s;eries of a fallen enemy, gave him an audience. At this interview the duke fell upon his knees, and begged his life in the mo&s;t abject terms. He even &s;igned a paper, offered him by the king, declaring his own illegitima|cy; and then the &s;tern tyrant a&s;&s;ured him, that his crime was of &s;uch a nature, as could not be pardoned. The duke perceiving that he had nothing to hope from the clemency of his uncle, recollected his &s;pirits, ro&s;e up,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
and retired with an air of di&s;dain. He was followed to the &s;caffold, with great compa&s;&s;ion from the populace. He warned the execu|tioner not to fall into the &s;ame error which he had committed in beheading Ru&s;&s;el, where it had been nece&s;&s;ary to redouble the blow. But this only encrea&s;ed the &s;everity of his puni&s;h|ment, the man was &s;eized with an univer&s;al tre|pidation; and he &s;truck a feeble blow, upon which the duke rai&s;ed his head from the block, as if to reproach him; he gently laid down his head a &s;econd time, and the executioner &s;truck him again and again to no purpo&s;e. He at la&s;t threw the ax down; but the &s;heriff compelled him to re&s;ume the attempt, and at two blows more the head was &s;evered from the body. Such was the end of James, duke of Mon|mouth, the darling of the Engli&s;h people. He was brave, &s;incere, and good natured, open to flattery and by that &s;educed into an enterprize, which exceded his capacity.</P>
<P>But it were well for the in&s;urgents, and fortunate for the king, if the blood that was now &s;hed had been thought a &s;ufficient expia|tion for the late offence. The victorious army behaved with the mo&s;t &s;avage cruelty to the pri&s;oners taken after the battle. Fever&s;ham immediately after the victory hanged up above twenty pri&s;oners; and was proceeding in his
<PB N="11" REF="13">
executions, when the bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells warned him that the&s;e unhappy men were now by law entitled to trial, and that their execu|tion would be deemed a real murther. Nine|teen were put to death in the &s;ame manner at Bridgewater, by colonel Kirke, a man of a &s;avage and bloody di&s;po&s;ition. This vile fel|low, practi&s;ed in the arts of &s;laughter at Tan|gier, where he &s;erved in garri&s;on, took a plea|&s;ure in committing in&s;tances of wanton barba|rity. He ordered a certain number to be put to death, while he and his company were drinking the king's health. Ob&s;erving their feet to &s;hake in the agonies of death, he cried that they &s;hould have mu&s;ic to their dancing, and ordered the trumpets to &s;ound. He rava|ged the whole country, without making any di&s;tinction between friend or foe. His own regiment, for their peculiar barbarity, went by the name of Kirke's Lambs. A &s;tory is told of his offering a young woman the life of her brother, in ca&s;e &s;he con&s;ented to his de&s;ires, which, when &s;he had done, he &s;hewed her her brother hanging out of the window. But this is told of &s;everal others, who have been notori|ous for cruelty, and may be the tale of malig|nity.</P>
<P>But the military &s;everities of the comman|ders were &s;till inferior to the legal &s;laughters,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
committed by judge Jefferies who was &s;ent down to try the delinquents. The natural brutality of this man's temper was enflamed by continual intoxication. He told the pri&s;o|ners, that if they would &s;ave him the trouble of trying them they might expect &s;ome fa|vour, otherwi&s;e he would execute the law upon them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. Many poor wretches were thus allured into a confe&s;&s;ion, and found that it only ha&s;tened their de&s;truc|tion. No le&s;s than eighty were executed at Dorche&s;ter; and, on the whole, at Exeter, Taunton, and Wells, two hundred and fifty-one are computed to have fallen by the hand of ju&s;tice. Women were not exempted from the general &s;everity, but &s;uffered for harbour|ing their neare&s;t kindred. Lady Li&s;le, though the widow of a regicide, was her&s;elf a loyali&s;t. She was apprehended for having &s;heltered in her hou&s;e two fugitives from the battle of Sedgemore. She proved that &s;he was ignorant of their crime when &s;he had given them pro|tection, and the jury &s;eemed inclined to com|pa&s;&s;ion: they twice brought in a favourable verdict; but they were as often &s;ent back by Jefferies, with menaces and reproaches, and at la&s;t were con&s;trained to give a verdict a|gain&s;t the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>But the fate of Mrs. Gaunt was &s;till more
<PB N="13" REF="15">
terrible. Mrs. Gaunt was an anabapti&s;t, noted for her beneficence, which &s;he had extended to per&s;ons of all profe&s;&s;ions and per&s;ua&s;ions. One of the rebels knowing her humane character, had recour&s;e to her in his di&s;tre&s;s, and was con|cealed by her. The abandoned villain hearing that a reward and indemnity was offered to &s;uch as informed again&s;t criminals, came in, and betrayed his protectre&s;s. His evidence was in|conte&s;tible; the proofs were &s;trong again&s;t her; he was pardoned for his treachery, and &s;he burned alive for her benevolence.</P>
<P>The work of &s;laughter went forward. One Corni&s;h, a &s;heriff, who had been long obnoxi|ous to the court, was accu&s;ed by Goodenough, now turned a common informer, and in the &s;pace of a week was tried, condemned, and executed. After his death, the perjury of the witne&s;&s;es appeared &s;o flagrant, that the king him&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome regret, granted his e&s;tate to the family, and condemned the wit|ne&s;&s;es to perpetual impri&s;onment. Jefferies, on his return was immediately created a peer, and was &s;oon after ve&s;ted with the dignity of chancellor. This &s;hewed the people that all the former cuelties were plea&s;ing to the king, and that he was re&s;olved to fix his throne upon &s;everity.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">It was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e &s;laugh|ters could acquire the king the love, or the confidence of his people; yet he thought this a very favourable juncture for carrying on his &s;chemes of religion and arbitrary power. Such attempts in Charles, however unju&s;t, were in &s;ome mea&s;ure politic, as he had a republican faction to contend with; and it might have been prudent then to over&s;tep ju&s;tice, in order to obtain &s;ecurity. But the &s;ame de|&s;igns in James, were as imprudent as they were impracticable; the republicans were then dimini&s;hed to an incon&s;iderable number, and the people were &s;en&s;ible of the advantages of a limited monarchy. However, James began to throw off the ma&s;k; and in the hou&s;e of commons, by his &s;peech, he &s;eemed to think him&s;elf exempted from all rules of prudence or nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;imulation. He told the hou&s;e, that the militia were found by expe|rience to be of no u&s;e; that it was nece&s;&s;ary to augment the &s;tanding army; and that he had employed a great many catholic officers, in who&s;e favour he had thought proper to di&s;|pen&s;e with the te&s;t, required to be taken by all entru&s;ted by the crown: he found them u&s;eful, he &s;aid, and he was determined to keep them employed. The&s;e &s;tretches of power natural|ly
<PB N="15" REF="17">
led the lords and commons into &s;ome de|gree of oppo&s;ition; but they &s;oon acquie&s;ced in the king's mea&s;ures, and then the parlia|ment was di&s;&s;olved for their tardy compliance. This was happy for the nation, for it was perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to pick out another hou&s;e of commons, that could be more ready to ac|quie&s;ce in the mea&s;ures of the crown.</P>
<P>The parliament being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,<MILESTONE N="1686" UNIT="A.D."> the next &s;tep was to &s;ecure a catholic intere&s;t in the privy council. Accordingly four catholic lords were admitted; Powis, Arundel, Bela&s;is, and Dover. The king made no &s;ecret of his de|&s;ires to have his courtiers converted to his own religion; Sunderland, who &s;aw that the only way to preferment was by popery, &s;crupled not to gain favour at that price. Roche&s;ter, the trea&s;urer, was turned out of his office, be|cau&s;e he refu&s;ed to conform. In the&s;e &s;chemes, James was entirely governed by the coun&s;els of the queen and of his confe&s;&s;or, father Pe|ters, a Je&s;uit whom he &s;oon after created a privy-coun&s;ellor. Even in Ireland, where the duke of Ormond had long &s;upported the royal cau&s;e, this nobleman was di&s;placed as being a prote&s;tant; and the lord Tyrconnel, a furious Roman catholic, was placed in his &s;tead. The king one day, in his attempts to
<PB N="16" REF="18">
convert his &s;ubjects, &s;tooped &s;o low as colonel Kirke; but this daring &s;oldier told him that he was pre-engaged, for he had promi&s;ed the king of Morocco, when he was quartered at Tangiers, that if he ever changed his religion, he would turn Mahometan.</P>
<P>But it could not be expected that the fa|vour &s;hewn by James to the catholics, would be tamely borne by the members of the Engli&s;h church. They had hitherto, indeed, &s;upport|ed the king again&s;t his republican enemies, and to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he chiefly owed his crown. But finding his partiality to the ca|tholics, the clergy of the church of England began to take the alarm, and commenced an oppo&s;ition to court mea&s;ures. The pulpits now thundered out again&s;t popery, and it was urged, that it was more formidable from the &s;upport granted it by the king. It was in vain that James attempted to impo&s;e &s;ilence on the&s;e topics; in&s;tead of avoiding the contro|ver&s;y, the prote&s;tant preachers pur&s;ued it with &s;till greater warmth.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion, was one doctor Sharpe, a clergyman of London, who declaimed with ju&s;t &s;everity again&s;t tho&s;e who had changed their religion, by &s;uch arguments as the popi&s;h
<PB N="17" REF="19">
mi&s;&s;ionaries were able to produce. This be|ing &s;uppo&s;ed to reflect upon the king, gave great offence at court; and po&s;itive orders were given to the bi&s;hop of London to &s;u&s;pend Sharpe till his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be far|ther known. The bi&s;hop refu&s;ed to comply; and the king re&s;olved to puni&s;h the bi&s;hop him&s;elf for di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>To effect his de&s;igns, he determined to revive the high commi&s;&s;ion court, which had given the nation &s;o much di&s;gu&s;t in the times of his father; and which had been for ever aboli&s;hed by act of parliament. But the laws were no ob&s;tacle to James, when they combatted his inclinations. An eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued out anew, by which &s;even com|mi&s;&s;ioners were inve&s;ted with a full and unli|mited authority over the whole church of England. This was a blow to the church which alarmed the kingdom; and could the authority of this court take place, the king's intentions of converting the nation would naturally follow. Before this tribunal the bi&s;hop was &s;ummoned, and not only he, but Sharpe the preacher, were &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep, was to allow a liberty of con|&s;cience to all &s;ectaries; and he was taught to believe that the truth of the catholic religion, would then, upon a fair trial, gain the victory.
<PB N="18" REF="20">
In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the &s;ame power that granted liberty of con&s;cience, might re&s;train it; and the catholic religion alone be then permitted to predominate. He therefore i&s;&s;ued a declara|tion of general indulgence, and a&s;&s;erted that non|conformity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion was no longer penal. In order to procure a favourable re|ception to this edict, he began by paying court to the di&s;&s;enters, as if it had been principally in|tended for their benefit. But that &s;ect was too cunning and &s;u&s;picious to be &s;o deceived. They knew that the king only meant to e&s;ta|bli&s;h his own religion, at the expence of theirs; and that both his own temper, and the genius of popery, had nothing of the true &s;pirit of toleration in them. They di&s;&s;embled, how|ever, their di&s;tru&s;t for a while; and the king went on &s;ilently applauding him&s;elf on the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his &s;chemes.</P>
<P>But his mea&s;ures were caution it&s;elf in Eng|land, compared with tho&s;e which were carried on in Scotland and Ireland. In Scotland, he ordered his parliament to grant a toleration to the catholics only, without ever attempting to intercede for the di&s;&s;enters, who were much more numerous. In Ireland, the prote&s;tants were totally expelled from all offices of tru&s;t and profit, and the catholics were put in their

places. Tyrconnel, who was ve&s;ted with full authority there, carried over as chancellor one Fitton, a man who had been taken from a jail; and who had been convicted of forgery and other crimes. This man, a zealous catholic, was heard to &s;ay from the bench, that all pro|te&s;tants were rogues; and that there was not one among forty thou&s;and, that was not a trai|tor, a rebel, and a villain.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures had &s;ufficiently di&s;gu&s;ted every part of the Briti&s;h empire; but to com|plete his work, for James did nothing by halves, he publicly &s;ent the earl of Ca&s;tle|maine, amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to Rome, in order to expre&s;s his obedience to the pope, and to reconcile his kingdoms to the catholic communion. Never was there &s;o much con|tempt thrown upon an emba&s;&s;y that was &s;o boldly undertaken. The court of Rome ex|pected but little &s;ucce&s;s from mea&s;ures &s;o blind|ly conducted. They were &s;en&s;ible that the king was openly &s;triking at tho&s;e laws and opinions, which it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to under|mine in &s;ilence and &s;ecurity. The cardinals were even heard facetiou&s;ly to declare, that the king &s;hould be excommunicated, for thus en|deavouring to overturn the &s;mall remains of popery that yet &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in England. The
<PB N="20" REF="22">
only proof of complai&s;ance which the king received from his holine&s;s, was his &s;ending a nuncio into England, in return for the em|ba&s;&s;y that was &s;ent to him.</P>
<P>This failed not to add to the general di&s;|content; and people &s;uppo&s;ed that he could never be &s;o ra&s;h as, contrary to expre&s;s act of parliament, to admit of a communication with the pope. But what was their &s;urprize, when they &s;aw the nuncio make his public and &s;o|lemn entry into Wind&s;or; and becau&s;e the duke of Somer&s;et refu&s;ed to attend the cere|mony, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his employment, of one of the lords of the bed-chamber.</P>
<P>But this was but the beginning of his at|tempts. The Je&s;uits &s;oon after were permit|ed to erect colleges in different parts of the kingdom; they exerci&s;ed the catholic wor&s;hip in the mo&s;t public manner; and four catholic bi&s;hops, con&s;ecrated in the king's chapel, were &s;ent through the kingdom to exerci&s;e their epi&s;copal functions, under the title of apo&s;to|lic vicars. Their pa&s;toral letters were printed by the king's printer, and di&s;tributed through all parts of the kingdom. The monks ap|peared at court in the habits of their orders, and a great number of prie&s;ts and friars ar|rived in England. Every great office the
<PB N="21" REF="23">
crown had to be&s;tow, was gradually tran&s;|ferred from the prote&s;tants; Roche&s;ter and Clarendon, the king's brothers in law, though they had been ever faithful to his intere&s;ts, were, becau&s;e prote&s;tants, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employments. Nothing now remained, but to open the door of the church and univer&s;ities to the intru&s;ion of the catholics, and this effort was &s;oon after begun.</P>
<P>Father Francis, a Benedictine monk, was recommended by the king to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, for the degree of ma&s;ter of arts. But his religion was a &s;tumbling block which the univer&s;ity could not get over; and they pre&s;ented a petition, be&s;eeching the king to recal his mandate. Their petition was di&s;re|garded, their deputies denied an hearing: the vice-chancellor him&s;elf was &s;ummoned to ap|pear before the high-commi&s;&s;ion court, and deprived of his office; yet the univer&s;ity per|&s;i&s;ted, and father Francis was refu&s;ed. The king thus foiled, thought proper at that time to drop his preten&s;ions, but he carried on his attempts upon the univer&s;ity of Oxford with &s;till greater vigour.</P>
<P>The place of pre&s;ident of Magdalen college, one of the riche&s;t foundations in Europe, being vacant, the king &s;ent a mandate in favour of
<PB N="22" REF="24">
one Farmer, a new convert, and a man of a bad character in other re&s;pects. The fellows of the college, made very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive appli|cations to the king for recalling his mandate; but before they received an an&s;wer, the day came on, which, by their &s;tatutes, they were required to proceed to an election. They therefore cho&s;e doctor Hough, a man of learn|ing, integrity, and re&s;olution. The king was incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption; and, in order to puni&s;h them, an inferior eccle&s;ia&s;tical court was &s;ent down, who finding Farmer a man of &s;candalous character, i&s;&s;ued a mandate for a new election. The per&s;on now recommended by the king, was doctor Parker, lately created bi&s;hop of Oxford, a man of pro&s;titute cha|racter; but who atoned for all his vices, by his willingne&s;s to embrace the catholic religion. The fellows refu&s;ed to comply with this in|junction, which &s;o incen&s;ed the king, that he repaired in per&s;on to Oxford, and ordered the fellows to be brought before him. He re|proached them with their in&s;olence and di&s;|obedience in the mo&s;t imperious terms; and commanded them to chu&s;e Parker without de|lay. Another refu&s;al on their &s;ide &s;erved &s;till more to exa&s;perate him; and finding them re|&s;olute in the defence of their privileges, he
<PB N="23" REF="25">
them all, except two, from their benefices, and Parker was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place. Up|on this, the college was filled with catholics; and Charnock, who was one of the two that remained, was made vice-pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>Every inva&s;ion of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil privileges of the nation only &s;eemed to encrea&s;e the king's ardour for more. A &s;econd decla|ration for liberty of con&s;cience was publi&s;hed,<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="A.D."> almo&s;t in the &s;ame terms with the former; but with this peculiar injunction, that all di|vines &s;hould read it after &s;ervice in their churches. As he thus put it in the power of thou&s;ands to refu&s;e, he armed again&s;t him&s;elf the whole body of the nation. The clergy were known univer&s;ally to di&s;approve of the &s;u&s;pend|ing power; and they were now re&s;olved to di&s;obey an order dictated by the mo&s;t bigotted motives. They were determined to tru&s;t their cau&s;e to the favour of the people, and that univer&s;al jealou&s;y which prevailed again&s;t the encroachments of the crown. The fir&s;t cham|pions on this &s;ervice of danger were Loyde, bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Ken of Bath and Wells, Turner of Ely, Lake of Chiche&s;ter, White of Peterborow, and Trelawney of Bri&s;tol; the&s;e, together with Sancroft the primate, con|certed an addre&s;s, in the form of a petition,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
to the king, which, with the warme&s;t expre&s;|&s;ions of zeal and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, remon&s;trated that they could not read his declaration con&s;i&s;tent with their con&s;ciences, or the re&s;pect they owed the prote&s;tant religion. This mode&s;t addre&s;s only &s;erved &s;till more to enflame the king's re|&s;entment. Former oppo&s;ition only &s;erved to hurry him on in coun&s;els as precipitate as they were tyrannical. He was re&s;olved not to let the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectful contradiction pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. He received their petition with marks of &s;urprize and di&s;plea&s;ure. He &s;aid, he did not expect &s;uch an addre&s;s from the Engli&s;h church, particularly from &s;ome among them, and per&s;i&s;ted in their obeying his mandate. The bi&s;hops left his pre&s;ence un|der &s;ome apprehen&s;ions from his fury; but &s;ecure in the favour of the people, and the rec|titude of their intentions.</P>
<P>The king's mea&s;ures were now become &s;o odious to the people, that, although the bi&s;hops of Durham and Roche&s;ter, who were members of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, ordered the decla|ration to be read in the churches of their re|&s;pective di&s;tricts, the audience could not hear them with any patience. One mini&s;ter told his congregation, that though he had po&s;itive orders to read the declaration, they had none
<PB N="25" REF="27">
to hear it, and therefore they might leave the church; an hint which the congregation quick|ly obeyed. It may ea&s;ily, therefore, be &s;up|po&s;ed that the petitioning bi&s;hops had little to dread from the utmo&s;t efforts of royal re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>As the petition was delivered in private, the king &s;ummoned the bi&s;hops before the coun|cil, and there que&s;tioned them whether they would acknowledge it? They for &s;ome time declined giving an an&s;wer; but being urged by the chancellor, they at la&s;t owned the peti|tion. On their refu&s;al to give bail, an order was immediately drawn for their commitment to the Tower, and the crown-lawyers received directions to pro&s;ecute them for a &s;editious libel.</P>
<P>The king gave orders that they &s;hould be conveyed to the Tower by water, as the whole city was in commotion in their favour. The people were no &s;ooner informed of their danger, than they ran to the river &s;ide, which was lined with incredible multitudes. As the reverend pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed, the populace fell upon their knees; and great numbers ran into the water, craving their ble&s;&s;ing, calling upon Heaven to protect them, and encouraging them to &s;uffer nobly in the cau&s;e of religion.
<PB N="26" REF="28">
The bi&s;hops were not wanting, by their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive and humble behaviour, to rai&s;e the pity of the &s;pectators; and they &s;till exhorted them to fear God, honour the king, and main|tain their loyalty. The very &s;oldiers, by whom they were guarded, kneeled down before them, and implored their forgivene&s;s. Upon landing, the bi&s;hops immediately went to the Tower-chapel to render thanks for tho&s;e afflictions which they &s;uffered in the cau&s;e of truth.</P>
<P>The twenty-ninth day of June was fixed for their trial; and their return was &s;till more &s;plendidly attended than their impri&s;onment. Twenty-nine peers, a great number of gentle|men, and an immen&s;e crowd of people, waited upon them to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. The cau&s;e was looked upon as involving the fate of the nation, and future freedom, or future &s;lavery awaited the deci&s;ion. The di&s;pute was learn|edly managed by the lawyers on both &s;ides. Holloway and Powel, two of the judges, de|clared them&s;elves in favour of the bi&s;hops. The jury withdrew into a chamber, where they pa&s;&s;ed the whole night; but next morn|ing they returned into court, and pronounced the bi&s;hops, Not guilty. We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall in&s;tantly rang with loud acclamations, which were communicated to the whole extent of
<PB N="27" REF="29">
the city. They even reached the camp at Houn&s;low, where the king was at dinner, in lord Fever&s;ham's tent. His maje&s;ty demanding the cau&s;e of tho&s;e rejoicings, and being inform|ed that it was nothing but the &s;oldiers &s;hout|ing at the delivery of the bi&s;hops,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Call you that nothing, cried he; but &s;o much the wor&s;e for them."</Q></P>
<P>If the bi&s;hops te&s;tified the readine&s;s of mar|tyrs in &s;upport of their religion, James &s;hewed no le&s;s ardour in his attempts toward the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his own. Grown odious to every cla&s;s of his &s;ubjects, he &s;till re&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t; for it was a part of his character, that tho&s;e mea&s;ures he once embraced he always per&s;evered in pur&s;uing. He &s;truck out two of the judges, Powel and Holloway, who had appeared to favour the bi&s;hops. He i&s;&s;ued orders to pro|&s;ecute all tho&s;e clergymen who had not read his declaration, and all had refu&s;ed it, except two hundred. He &s;ent a mandate to the new fellows, whom he had obtruded on Magdalen College, to elect for pre&s;ident, in the room of Parker, lately decea&s;ed, one Gifford, a doctor of the Sorbonne, and titular bi&s;hop of Ma|dura.</P>
<P>As he found the clergy every where aver&s;e to the har&s;hne&s;s of his proceedings, he was
<PB N="28" REF="30">
willing to try next what he could do with the army. He thought if one regiment &s;hould promi&s;e implicit obedience, their example would &s;oon induce others to comply. He therefore ordered one of the regiments to be drawn up in his pre&s;ence, and de&s;ired that &s;uch as were again&s;t his late declaration of liberty of con&s;cience &s;hould lay down their arms, He was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the whole battalion ground their arms, except two officers, and a few roman catholic &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition only &s;erved to enflame this infatuated monarch's zeal. He was continu|ally &s;timulated by the queen, and the prie&s;ts about him, to go forward without receding. A fortunate circum&s;tance happened in his fa|mily. A few days before the acquittal of the bi&s;hops, the queen was brought to bed of a &s;on, who was bapti&s;ed by the name of James. This would, if any thing could at that time, have &s;erved to e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne; but &s;o great was the animo&s;ity again&s;t him, that a &s;tory was propagated that the child was &s;uppo&s;ititious, and brought to the queen's apartment in a warm|ing-pan. But &s;o great was this monarch's pride, that he &s;corned to take any precautions to refute the calumny. Indeed all his mea&s;ures were marked with the characters of pride, cruelty,
<PB N="29" REF="31">
bigotry, and weakne&s;s. In the&s;e he was chief|ly &s;upported by Father Peters, his confe&s;&s;or, an ambitious, ignorant, and intriguing prie&s;t, whom &s;ome &s;cruple not to call a concealed creature belonging to the prince of Orange. By that prince's &s;ecret directions, it is a&s;&s;erted, though upon no very good authority, that James was hurried on, under the guidance of Peters, from one precipice to another, until he was obliged to give up the reins of that government which he went near to over|throw.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVIII. JAMES II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM, prince of Orange, had married Mary, the elde&s;t daughter of king James. This prince&s;s had been bred a pro|te&s;tant; and as &s;he was for a long time heir apparent to the throne, the people tamely bore the encroachments of the king, in hopes that his prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;or would rectify tho&s;e mea&s;ures he had taken towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery, and the exten&s;ion of the prerogative of the crown. For this rea&s;on, the prince gave the king not only advice but a&s;&s;i&s;tance in all emer|gencies, and had actually &s;upplied him with &s;ix thou&s;and troops upon Monmouth's inva&s;ion. But now, when a young prince was born, that entirely excluded his hopes by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he lent more attention to the complaints of the nation; and began to foment tho&s;e di&s;contents, which be|fore he had endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>William was a prince who had, from his earlie&s;t entrance into bu&s;ine&s;s, been immer&s;ed in dangers, calamities, and politics. The am|bition
<PB N="31" REF="33">
of France, and the jealou&s;ies of Hol|land, had &s;erved to &s;harpen his talents, and to give him a propen&s;ity to intrigue. This great politician and &s;oldier concealed, beneath a phlegmatic appearance, a mo&s;t violent and boundle&s;s ambition; all his actions were level|led at power, while his di&s;cour&s;e never betray|ed the wi&s;hes of his heart. His temper was cold and &s;evere; his genius active and pier|cing; he was valiant, without o&s;tentation, and politic without addre&s;s. Di&s;daining the elegance and plea&s;ures of life, yet eager after the phan|tom of pre-eminence; through his whole life he was indefatigable; and though an un|&s;ucce&s;sful general in the field, yet he was &s;till a formidable negociator in the cabinet. By his intrigues he &s;aved his own country from ruin; he re&s;tored the liberties of England, and pre&s;erved the independence of Europe. Thus, though neither his abilities nor his virtues were of the highe&s;t kind, yet there are few per&s;ons in hi&s;tory who&s;e actions and conduct have con|tributed more eminently to the general intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and of mankind.</P>
<P>This politic prince now plainly &s;aw that James had incurred the mo&s;t violent hatred of his &s;ubjects.<MILESTONE N="1688" UNIT="A.D."> He was minutely informed of their di&s;contents; and, by &s;eeming to di&s;cou|rage,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
&s;till farther encrea&s;ed them. He there|fore began by giving one Dykevelt, his envoy, in&s;tructions to apply in his name to every &s;ect and denomination in the kingdom. To the church-party he &s;ent a&s;&s;urances of favour and regard; and prote&s;ted that his education in Holland had no way prejudiced him again&s;t epi&s;copacy. To the non-conformi&s;ts he &s;ent ex|hortations not to be deceived by the in&s;idious ca|re&s;&s;es of their known enemy; but to wait for a real and &s;incere protector. Dykevelt executed his commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch dexterity, that all orders of men ca&s;t their eyes towards Holland, and expected from thence a deliverance from tho&s;e dangers with which they were threatened at home.</P>
<P>The prince &s;oon found that every rank was ripe for defection, and received invitations from &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons in the kingdom. Admiral Herbert, and admi|ral Ru&s;&s;el, a&s;&s;ured him in per&s;on of their own and the national attachment. Henry Sidney, brother to Algernon, and uncle to the earl of Sunderland, came over to him with a&s;&s;urances of an univer&s;al combination again&s;t the king. Lord Dumblaine, &s;on to the earl of Danby, being ma&s;ter of a frigate, made &s;everal voyages to Holland, and carried from many of the no|bility
<PB N="33" REF="35">
tenders of duty and even con&s;iderable &s;ums of money to the prince of Orange. Soon after the bi&s;hop of London, the earls of Dan|by, Nottingham, Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et, with &s;everal other lords, gentlemen, and principal citizens, united in their addre&s;&s;es to him, and entreated his &s;peedy de&s;cent.</P>
<P>The people of England, though long di|vided between Whig and Tory, were unani|mous in their mea&s;ures again&s;t the king. The Whigs hated upon principles of liberty, the Tories upon principles of religion. The former had ever &s;hewn them&s;elves tenacious of their political rights; the latter were equally ob&s;tinate in defence of their religious tenets. James had invaded both; &s;o that for a time all factions were laid a&s;leep, except that gene|ral one of driving the tyrant from a throne, which, upon every account, he was &s;o ill qua|lified to fill. William, therefore, determined to accept of the invitations of the kingdom, and &s;till more readily embarked in the cau&s;e, as he &s;aw that the malcontents had conducted their mea&s;ures with prudence and &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>The time when the prince entered upon his enterprize was ju&s;t when the people were in a flame from the recent in&s;ult offered to their bi&s;hops. He had before this made con&s;ider|able
<PB N="34" REF="36">
augmentations to the Dutch fleet, and the &s;hips were then lying ready in the harbour. Some additional troops were al&s;o levied, and &s;ums of money rai&s;ed for other purpo&s;es were converted to the advancement of this expedi|tion. The Dutch had always repo&s;ed an en|tire confidence him; and many of the neigh|bouring princes regarded him as their guar|dian and protector. He was &s;ure of their pro|tection of his native government, while he &s;hould be employed in England; and the troops of &s;ome of the German powers were actually marched down to Holland for that purpo&s;e. Every place was in motion; all Europe &s;aw and expected the de&s;cent, except the unfortunate James him&s;elf, who, &s;ecure in the piety of his intentions, thought nothing could injure his &s;chemes calculated to promote the cau&s;e of heaven.</P>
<P>The king of France was the fir&s;t who ap|pri&s;ed him of his danger, and offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in repelling it. He was willing to join a &s;quadron of French &s;hips to the Engli&s;h fleet, and to &s;end over any number of troops which James &s;hould judge requi&s;ite for his &s;ecurity. James, however, could not be convinced that his &s;on-in-law intended an inva&s;ion; fully &s;a|tisfied him&s;elf of the &s;acredne&s;s of his autho|rity,
<PB N="35" REF="37">
he imagined a like belief had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;ubjects. He therefore rejected the French king's propo&s;al, unwilling perhaps to call in foreign aid, when he had an army &s;ufficient at home. When this proffer was rejected, Lewis again offered to march down his numerous army to the frontiers of the Dutch provinces, and thus to detain their forces at home to de|fend them&s;elves. This propo&s;al met with no better reception. Still Lewis was unwilling to abandon a friend and ally, who&s;e intere&s;t he regarded as clo&s;ely connected with his own. He ventured to remon&s;trate with the Dutch again&s;t the preparations they were making to invade England. The Dutch accu&s;ed his remon&s;trance as an officious impertinence, and James him&s;elf declined his mediation.</P>
<P>James having thus rejected the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends, and being left to face the danger alone, was a&s;toni&s;hed, with an advice from his mini&s;|ter in Holland, that an inva&s;ion was not only projected, but avowed. When he fir&s;t read the letter containing this information he grew pale, and the letter dropt from his hand. He &s;aw the gulph into which he was fallen, and he knew not where to &s;eek for protection. His only re&s;ource was in retreating from tho&s;e va|rious precipitate mea&s;ures into which he had
<PB N="36" REF="38">
plunged him&s;elf. He paid court to the Dutch, and offered to enter into any alliance with them for their common &s;ecurity. He replaced in all the counties the deputy-lieutenants and ju&s;tices, who had been deprived of their commi&s;&s;ions for their adherence to the te&s;t and penal laws. He re&s;tored the charters of &s;uch corporations as he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of; he annulled the high-commi&s;&s;ion court; he rein&s;tated the expelled pre&s;ident and fellows of Magdalen College, and he was even reduced to care&s;s tho&s;e bi&s;hops, whom he had &s;o lately per&s;e|cuted and in&s;ulted.</P>
<P>But all his conce&s;&s;ions were now too late. They were regarded as the &s;ymptoms of fear, and not of repentance; as the cowardice of guilt, and not the conviction of error. In|deed he &s;oon &s;hewed the people the in&s;incerity of his reformation; for hearing that the Dutch fleet was di&s;per&s;ed, he recalled tho&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions which he had made in favour of Magda|len College; and, to &s;hew his attachment to the Romi&s;h church, at the bapti&s;m of his new-born &s;on, he appointed the pope one of the &s;pon&s;ors.</P>
<P>In the mean time the declaration of the prince of Orange was indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed over the kingdom. In this he enumerated all
<PB N="37" REF="39">
the grievances of which the nation complain|ed; he promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in redre&s;&s;ing them; he a&s;&s;ured the nation that his only aim was to procure them the la&s;ting &s;ettlement of their liberty and their religion; and that the only motive of his going over was to learn the &s;en&s;e of the people in a full and free par|liament.</P>
<P>This declaration he quickly followed by pre|parations for a vigorous inva&s;ion. So well concerted were his mea&s;ures, that in three days above four hundred tran&s;ports were hired, the army fell down the rivers and canals from Ni|meguen, with all nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores; and the prince &s;et &s;ail from Helveot&s;luys with a fleet of near five hundred ve&s;&s;els, and an army of above fourteen thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Fortune, however, &s;eemed at fir&s;t every way unfavourable to his enterprize. He encounter|ed a dreadful &s;torm, which put him back; but he &s;oon refitted his fleet, and once more ven|tured for England. It was given out that this inva&s;ion was intended for the coa&s;ts of France, and many of the Engli&s;h, who &s;aw the fleet pa&s;s along their coa&s;ts, little expected to &s;ee it land on their own &s;hores. It happened that the &s;ame wind which &s;ent them to their de|&s;tined port detained the Engli&s;h fleet in the
<PB N="38" REF="40">
river, &s;o that the Dutch pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights of Dover without mole&s;tation. Thus after a voyage of two days, the prince landed his army at the village of Broxholme in Torbay, on the fifth of November, which was the an|niver&s;ary of the gun-powder trea&s;on.</P>
<P>But though the invitation from the Engli&s;h was very general, the prince for &s;ome time had the mortification to find him&s;elf joined by very few. He marched fir&s;t to Exeter, where the country people had been &s;o lately terrified with the executions which had en&s;ued on Mon|mouth's rebellion, that they continued to ob|&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality. But &s;light repul&s;es were not able to intimidate a general, who had from his early youth been taught to encounter adver|&s;ity. He continued for ten days in expectation of being joined by the malcontents, and at la&s;t began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. But ju&s;t when he began to deliberate about reimbarking his forces, he was joined by &s;everal per&s;ons of con&s;equence, and the whole country &s;oon after came flocking to his &s;tandard. The fir&s;t per|&s;on who joined the prince was major Burring|ton, and he was quickly followed by the gen|try of the counties of Devon and Somer&s;et. Sir Edward Seymour made propo&s;als for an a&s;&s;ociation, which every one &s;igned. By de|grees
<PB N="39" REF="41">
the earl of Abington, Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, &s;on to the earl of Bedford, Mr. Wharton, God|frey, Howe, all came to Exeter. England was in commotion. Lord Delamere took arms in Che&s;hire; the earl of Danby &s;eized York; the earl of Bath, governor of Plymouth, de|clared for the prince; the earl of Devon&s;hire made a like declaration in Derby; the nobi|lity and gentry of Nottingham embraced the &s;ame cau&s;e; and every day there appeared &s;ome effect of that univer&s;al combination into which the nation had entered again&s;t the mea|&s;ures of the king.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptom was the di&s;affection of the army, which &s;eemed uni|ver&s;ally tinctured with the &s;pirit of the times. Lord Colche&s;ter, &s;on to the earl of Rivers, was the fir&s;t officer who de&s;erted to the prince. Lord Lovelace was taken in the like attempt by the militia, under the duke of Beaufort. Lord Cornbury, &s;on to the earl of Clarendon, carried off the greate&s;t part of three regi|ments of cavalry to the prince. Several of|ficers of di&s;tinction informed Fever&s;ham, the general, that they could not in con&s;cience fight again&s;t the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>The defection of the officers was followed by that of the king's own &s;ervants and crea|tures.
<PB N="40" REF="42">
Lord Churchill had been rai&s;ed from the rank of a page, and had been inve&s;ted with an high command in the army; had been created a peer, and owed his whole fortune to the king's bounty; even he de&s;erted among the re&s;t, and carried with him the duke of Grafton, natural &s;on to the late king, colonel Berkely, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>In this univer&s;al defection, the unfortunate James not knowing where to turn, and on whom to rely, began to think of reque&s;ting a&s;&s;i&s;tance from France, when it was now too late. He wrote to Leopold, emperor of Ger|many, but in vain. That monarch only return|ed for an&s;wer, that what he had fore&s;een had happened. James had &s;ome dependence on his fleet; but they were entirely di&s;affected. In a word, his intere&s;ts were de&s;erted by all; for he had long de&s;erted them him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was by this time arrived at Sali&s;bury, the head quarters of his army; and he found that this body amounted to twenty thou&s;and men. It is po&s;&s;ible that had he led the&s;e to the combat, without granting them time for deliberation, they might have fought in his favour, and &s;ecured him on the throne. But he was involved in a maze of fears and &s;u&s;pi|cions; the defection of tho&s;e he mo&s;t confided
<PB N="41" REF="43">
in took away his confidence in all, and de|prived him even of the power of deliberation. It was no &s;mall addition to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s that the prince of Denmark, and Anne, his favourite daughter, perceiving the de&s;pera|tion of his circum&s;tances, re&s;olved to leave him, and take part with the prevailing &s;ide. When he was told that the prince and prince&s;s had followed the re&s;t of his favourites, he was &s;tung with the mo&s;t bitter angui&s;h.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God help me, cried he, in the extremity of his agony, my own children have for&s;aken me."</Q></P>
<P>During this di&s;traction and perplexity, he embraced a &s;udden re&s;olution of drawing off his army, and retiring towards London; a mea&s;ure which could only &s;erve to betray his fears, and provoke farther treachery. Thus driven to the precipice of his fortunes, in|vaded by one &s;on-in-law, abandoned by an|other, de&s;pi&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, and hated by tho&s;e that had &s;uffered beneath his cruelty, he a&s;|&s;embled the few noblemen that &s;till adhered to his intere&s;ts. There in his forlorn council he demanded the advice of tho&s;e he mo&s;t con|fided in. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the earl of Bedford, father to lord Ru&s;&s;el, who had been executed in the former reign by the in|trigues of James,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My lord, &s;aid the king,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
you are an hone&s;t man, have credit, and can do me &s;ignal &s;ervice."</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ah, Sir, replied the earl, I am old and feeble; I can do you but little &s;ervice. I had indeed a &s;on!"</Q>
James was &s;o &s;truck with this reply, that he could not &s;peak for &s;ome minutes.</P>
<P>The king's fortune now expo&s;ed him to the contempt of his enemies; and his beha|viour was &s;uch as could not procure him the e&s;teem of his friends and adherents. He was naturally timid; and &s;ome coun&s;ellors about him, either &s;haring his fears, or &s;ecretly at|tached to the prince, contributed to encrea&s;e his apprehen&s;ions. They reminded him of the fate of his father, and aggravated the tur|bulence and incon&s;tancy of the people. They at length per&s;uaded him to fly from a nation he could no longer govern, and to &s;eek for refuge at the court of France, where he was &s;ure of a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection. The popi&s;h courtiers, and above all the prie&s;ts, were &s;en|&s;ible that they would be made the fir&s;t &s;acri|fice upon the oppo&s;ite party's prevailing. They were therefore de&s;irous of carrying the king along with them, as his pre&s;ence would be &s;till their honour and protection abroad.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange was no le&s;s de&s;irous of the king's flying over to France than his
<PB N="43" REF="45">
mo&s;t zealous coun&s;ellors could be. He was determined to u&s;e every expedient to intimi|date the king, and drive him out of the king|dom. He declined a per&s;onal conference with the king's commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;ent the earls of Clarendon and Oxford to treat with them. The terms which he propo&s;ed implied almo&s;t a pre&s;ent participation of the &s;overeignty; and to urge his mea&s;ures, he &s;topped not a moment in his march towards London.</P>
<P>The king alarmed every day more and more with the pro&s;pect of a general di&s;affection, was re&s;olved to hearken to tho&s;e who advi&s;ed his quitting the kingdom. To prepare for this he fir&s;t &s;ent away the queen, who arrived &s;afely at Calais, under the conduct of count Lauzun, an old favourite of the French king. He him&s;elf &s;oon after di&s;appeared in the night time, attended only by Sir Edward Hales, a new convert; and di&s;gui&s;ing him&s;elf in a plain dre&s;s went down to Fever&s;ham, where he embarked on board a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el for France. But his misfortunes &s;till continued to pur&s;ue him. The ve&s;&s;el in which he had embarked was detained by the populace, who, not know|ing the per&s;on of the king, robbed, in&s;ulted, and abu&s;ed him. He was now, therefore, per&s;uaded by the earl of Winchel&s;ea to return
<PB N="44" REF="46">
to London, where again the populace, moved by his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and guided by their natural levity, received him, contrary to his expecta|tions, with &s;houts and acclamations.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more di&s;agreeable to the prince of Orange than to hear that James was brought back, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, trium|phantly, to his capital. He had before taken mea&s;ures to &s;eize upon that authority, which the king's dereliction had put into his hands. The bi&s;hops and peers, who were now the only authorized magi&s;trates in the &s;tate, gave direc|tions, in the pre&s;ent di&s;&s;olution of government, for keeping the peace of the city. They i&s;&s;ued orders, which were readily obeyed, to the fleet, the garri&s;ons, and the army. They made ap|plications to the prince, who&s;e enterprize they highly applauded, and who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s they joy|fully congratulated. It was not therefore without extreme mortification that he found the king returned once more to embarra&s;s his proceedings.</P>
<P>The prince of Orange, however, determined to di&s;&s;emble, and received the news of his return with an haughty air. His aim from the be|ginning was to pu&s;h him by threats and &s;eve|rities to relinqui&s;h the throne; and his pro|ceedings argued the refined politician. The
<PB N="45" REF="47">
king having &s;ent lord Fever&s;ham on a civil me&s;&s;age to the prince, de&s;iring a conference previous to the &s;ettlement of the throne, that nobleman was put under an arre&s;t on pretence of his wanting a pa&s;&s;port. The Dutch guards were ordered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Whitehall, where the king then lodged, and to di&s;place the Engli&s;h. The king was &s;oon after com|manded by a me&s;&s;age, which he received in bed at midnight, to leave his palace next morn|ing, and to depart for Ham, a &s;eat of the dutche&s;s of Lauderdale's. He de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to retire to Roche&s;ter, a town not far from the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and oppo&s;ite France. This was rea|dily granted him; and it was now perceived that the har&s;h mea&s;ures of the prince had taken effect, and that James was meditating an e&s;cape from the kingdom.</P>
<P>The king while he continued at Roche&s;ter &s;eemed willing to receive invitations once more to re&s;ume the crown; but the prince had not been at all this expence and trouble in taking him from a throne to place him there again. James, therefore, ob&s;erving that he was entirely neglected by his own &s;ub|jects, and oppre&s;&s;ed by his &s;on-in-law, re&s;olv|ed to &s;eek &s;afety from the king of France, the only friend he had &s;till remaining. He ac|cordingly fled to the &s;ea-&s;ide, attended by his
<PB N="46" REF="48">
natural &s;on the duke of Berwick, where he em|barked for the continent. He arrived in &s;afety at Ambleteu&s;e in Picardy, from whence he ha&s;t|ened to the court of France, where he &s;till enjoyed the empty title of a king, and the ap|pellation of a &s;aint, which flattered him more.</P>
<P>After this manner, the courage and abilities of the prince of Orange, &s;econded by &s;urpri&s;|ing fortune, effected the delivery of the king|dom. It now remained that he &s;hould reap the rewards of his toil; and obtain that crown for him&s;elf, which had fallen from the head of his father-in-law. Previou&s;ly, therefore, to any regular authority, he continued in the ma|nagement of all public affairs. By the advice of the hou&s;e of lords, the only member of the legi&s;lature remaining, he was de&s;ired to &s;um|mon a parliament by circular letters; but the prince, unwilling to act upon &s;o imperfect an authority, convened all the members, who had &s;at in the hou&s;e of commons during any parliament of Charles the &s;econd, and to the&s;e were added the mayor, aldermen, and fifty of the com|mon-council. This was the mo&s;t proper re|pre&s;entative of the people that could be &s;um|moned, during the pre&s;ent emergence. They unaminou&s;ly voted the &s;ame addre&s;s with the lords; and the prince being thus &s;upported
<PB N="47" REF="49">
by legal authority, wrote circular letters to the counties and corporations of England, to chu&s;e a new parliament. His orders were uni|ver&s;ally complied with; every thing went on in the mo&s;t regular peaceful manner, and the prince became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all authority, as if he had regularly &s;ucceeded to the throne.</P>
<P>When the hou&s;e met,<MILESTONE N="Jan. 22, 1689."> which was mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of the Whig party, after thanks were given to the prince of Orange for the deliverance which he had brought them, they then proceeded to the &s;ettlement of the king|dom. In a few days they pa&s;&s;ed a vote, by a great majority, which was &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords for their concurrence. It was to this effect. That king James the &s;econd having endeavoured to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of the kingdom, by breaking the original contract betwixt the king and people, and having, by the advice of Je&s;uits, and other wicked per&s;ons, violated the fundamental laws, and withdrawn him&s;elf out of the kingdom, had abdicated the government, and that the throne was thereby vacant. This vote readily pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons; but it met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords, and was at length car|ried by a majority of two voices only.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="50">The king being thus depo&s;ed, the next con|&s;ideration was the appointing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Some declared for a regent; others, that the prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould be inve&s;ted with regal pow|er, and the young prince con&s;idered as &s;uppo|&s;ititious. The debates ran high. A confer|ence was demanded between the lords and commons, while the prince with his u&s;ual pru|dence, entered into no intrigues either with the electors or members; but kept a total &s;ilence, as if he had been no way concerned in the tran&s;action. At la&s;t, perceiving that his own name was little mentioned in the&s;e di&s;putes, he called together the lords Hallifax, Shrew&s;bury, and Danby, with a few more. He then told them that he had been called over to defend the liberties of the Engli&s;h nation, and that he had happily effected his purpo&s;e; that he had heard of &s;everal &s;chemes propo&s;ed for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the government; that if they cho&s;e a regent, he thought it incum|bent on him to inform them that he would never accept of that office, the execution of which he knew would be attended with in&s;u|perable difficulties; that he would not ac|cept of the crown under the prince&s;s his wife, though he was convinced of her merits, that therefore if either of the&s;e &s;chemes were adopted,
<PB N="49" REF="51">
he could give them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the &s;ettle|ment of the nation; but would return home to his own country, &s;atisfied with his aims to &s;e|cure the freedom of theirs. This declaration produced the intended effect. After a long debate in both hou&s;es, a new &s;overeign was preferred to a regent, by a majority of two voices. It was agreed that the prince and prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould reign jointly as king and queen of England, while the admini&s;tra|tion of government &s;hould be placed in the hands of the prince only. The marquis of Hallifax, as &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of lords, made a &s;olemn tender of the crown to their highne&s;&s;es, in the name of the peers and com|mons of England. The prince accepted the offer in terms of acknowledgment; and that very day William and Mary were proclaimed king and queen of England.</P>

</FIGURE> CHAP. XXXVIII. WILLIAM III.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;titution, upon the acce&s;&s;ion of William to the crown, took a different form from what it had before. As his right to the crown was wholly from the choice of the people, they cho&s;e to load the benefit with whatever &s;tipulations they thought requi&s;ite for their own &s;ecurity. His power, therefore, was limited on every &s;ide; and the jealou&s;y
<PB N="51" REF="53">
which his new &s;ubjects entertained of foreign|ers, &s;till farther ob&s;tructed the exerci&s;e of his authority. The power of the crown was ac|knowledged to flow from no other fountain than that of a contract with the people. The repre&s;entatives of the nation made a regular claim of rights in behalf of their con&s;tituents, which, previous to his coronation, William was obliged to confirm.</P>
<P>This declaration of rights maintained, that the &s;u&s;pending and di&s;pen&s;ing powers, as exer|ci&s;ed by king James, were uncon&s;titutional; that all courts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion, the levying money, or maintaining a &s;tanding army in times of peace, without con&s;ent of parliament; that grants of fines and forfeitures before conviction, and juries of per&s;ons not qualified, or not fairly cho&s;en; and, in trials for trea&s;on, who were not freeholders, were all unlawful. It a&s;&s;erted the free|dom of election to parliament, the freedom of &s;peech in parliament, and the right of the &s;ubject to bear arms, and to petition his &s;overeign. It provided, that exce&s;&s;ive bails &s;hould not be required, nor exce&s;&s;ive fines be impo&s;ed, nor cruel and unu&s;ual puni&s;hments be inflicted; and it concluded with an injunction that par|liaments &s;hould be frequently a&s;&s;embled. Such was the bill of rights, calculated to &s;ecure the
<PB N="52" REF="54">
liberties of the people; but having been drawn up in a ferment, it bears all the marks of ha&s;te, in&s;ufficiency, and inattention.</P>
<P>William was no &s;ooner elected to the throne, than he began to experience the difficulty of governing a people, who were more ready to examine the commands of their &s;uperiors, than to obey them. From the peaceful and tract|able di&s;po&s;ition of his own countrymen, he ex|pected a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition among the Engli&s;h; he hoped to find them ready and willing to &s;e|cond his ambition in humbling France, but he found them more apt to fear for the inva&s;ion of their dome&s;tic liberties at home.</P>
<P>His reign commenced with an attempt, &s;imi|lar to that which had been the principal cau&s;e of all the di&s;turbances in the preceding reign, and which had excluded the monarch from the throne. William was a Calvini&s;t, and con&s;equent|ly aver&s;e to per&s;ecution; he therefore began by attempting to repeal tho&s;e laws that enjoined uniformity of wor&s;hip; and though he could not entirely &s;ucceed in his de&s;ign, a toleration was granted to &s;uch di&s;&s;enters as &s;hould take the oaths of allegiance, and hold no private conventicles. The papi&s;ts them&s;elves, who had every thing to fear, experienced the lenity of his government; and though the laws
<PB N="53" REF="55">
again&s;t them were unrepealed, yet they were &s;eldom put into rigorous execution. Thus what was criminal in James, became virtuous in his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, as James wanted to introduce per&s;ecution, by pretending to di&s;own it; while William had no other de&s;ign, but to make re|ligious freedom the te&s;t of civil &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>But though William was acknowledged king in England; Scotland and Ireland were &s;till undetermined. The Revolution in England, had been brought about by a coalition of Whigs and Tories; but in Scotland it was effected by the Whigs almo&s;t alone. They &s;oon came to a re&s;olution, that king James had, to u&s;e their own expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>forfaulted</HI> his right to the crown, a term which, in the law-language of that country, excluded not only him, but all his po&s;terity.<MILESTONE N="1689" UNIT="A.D."> They therefore quickly recognized the authority of William, and took that opportunity to aboli&s;h epi&s;co|pacy, which had long been di&s;agreeable to the nation.</P>
<P>Nothing now remained to the depo&s;ed king of all his former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions but Ireland; and he had &s;ome hopes of maintaining his ground there, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he was promi&s;ed from France. Lewis XIV. had long been at va|riance with William, and took every opportu|tunity
<PB N="54" REF="56">
to form confederacies again&s;t him, and to ob&s;truct his government. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, being either touched with compa&s;|&s;ion at the &s;ufferings of James, or willing to weaken a rival kingdom, by promoting its in|ternal di&s;&s;en&s;ions, he granted the depo&s;ed mo|narch a fleet and &s;ome troops, to a&s;&s;ert his pre|ten&s;ions in Ireland, the only part of his do|minions that had not openly declared again&s;t him.</P>
<P>On the other hand, William was not back|ward in warding off the threatened blow. He was plea&s;ed with an opportunity of gratifying his natural hatred again&s;t France; and he hoped to purcha&s;e dome&s;tic quiet to him&s;elf, by turning the &s;pirit of the nation upon the continual object of its aver&s;ion and jealou&s;y. The parliament, though divided in all things el&s;e, yet was unanimous in con&s;piring with him in this; a war was declared again&s;t France, and mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued for driving James from Ireland, where he had landed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted rather by money than by forces, granted him from the French king.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh day of May, 1689, that un|happy monarch embarked at Bre&s;t, and on the twenty-&s;econd arrived at Kin&s;ale&punc; and &s;oon after made his public entry into Dublin, amid&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="57">
the acclamations of the inhabitants. He found the appearances of things in that country equal to his mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. Tyrcon|nel, the lord lieutenant, was devoted to his in|tere&s;ts; his old army was &s;teady, and a new one rai&s;ed, amounting together to near forty-thou&s;and men. The prote&s;tants over the great|e&s;t part of Ireland were di&s;armed, the province of Ul&s;ter alone denied his authority; while the papi&s;ts, confident of &s;ucce&s;s, received him with &s;houts of joy and &s;uper&s;titious proce&s;&s;ions, which gave him &s;till greater plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, the prote&s;tants of Ireland underwent the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel indig|nities. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were attached to the revolution, were obliged to retire into Scotland and England, or hid them&s;elves, or accepted written protections from their ene|mies. The brave&s;t of them, however, to the number of ten thou&s;and men, gathered round Londonderry, re&s;olved to make their la&s;t &s;tand at that place, for their religion and liberty. A few al&s;o rallied them&s;elves at Inni&s;killing; and after the fir&s;t panic was over, became more nu|merous by the junction of others.</P>
<P>James continued for &s;ome time irre&s;olute what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue; but as &s;oon as the &s;pring would permit, he went to lay &s;iege to London|derry,
<PB N="56" REF="58">
a town of &s;mall importance in it&s;elf, but rendered famous by the &s;tand which it made on this occa&s;ion. Colonel Lundie had been appointed governor of the town by William, but was &s;ecretly attached to king James; and at a council of war, prevailed upon the offi|cers and town&s;men, to &s;end me&s;&s;engers to the be&s;iegers with an offer of &s;urrender the day following. But the inhabitants, being appri&s;ed of his intention, and crying out that they were betrayed, ro&s;e in a fury again&s;t the gover|nor and council; &s;hot one of the officers whom they &s;u&s;pected, and boldly re&s;olved to maintain the town, though de&s;titute of leaders.</P>
<P>The town was weak in its fortifications, hav|ing only a wall eight or nine feet thick, and and weaker &s;till in its artillery, there being not above twenty &s;erviceable guns upon the works. The new-made garri&s;on, however, made up every deficiency by courage; one Walker, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, and major Baker, put them|&s;elves at the head of the&s;e re&s;olute men; and thus abandoned to their fate, they prepared for a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. The batteries of the be|&s;iegers &s;oon began to play upon the town with great fury; and &s;everal attacks were made, but always repul&s;ed with re&s;olution. All the &s;uc|ce&s;s
<PB N="57" REF="59">
that valour could promi&s;e, was on their &s;ide; but they, after &s;ome time, found them|&s;elves exhau&s;ted by continual fatigue; they were afflicted al&s;o with a contagious di&s;temper which thinned their numbers; and as there were many u&s;ele&s;s mouths in the city, they be|gan to be reduced to the greate&s;t extremities for want of provi&s;ion. They had even the mortification to &s;ee &s;ome &s;hips, which had ar|rived with &s;upplies from England, prevented from &s;ailing up the river by the batteries of the enemy, and a boom by which they had block|ed up the channel. General Kirke was not more &s;ucce&s;sful, who attempted to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was prevented from &s;ailing up the river. All he could do, was to promi&s;e them &s;peedy relief, and to exhort them to bear their mi&s;eries a little longer, with a&s;&s;urances of a glorious termination of them all. They had now con&s;umed the la&s;t remains of their provi|&s;ion; and &s;upported life, by eating hor&s;es, dogs, and all kinds of vermin, while even this loath|&s;ome food began to fail them. They had &s;till farther the mi&s;ery of &s;eeing above four thou|&s;and of their fellow prote&s;tants, from different parts of the country, driven by Ro&s;ene, James's general, under the walls of the town, where they were kept three whole days without pro|vi&s;ion.
<PB N="58" REF="60">
Kirke, in the mean time, who had been &s;ent to their relief, continued unactive, debating with him&s;elf between the prudence and nece&s;&s;ity of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At la&s;t, receiv|ing intelligence that the garri&s;on, &s;unk with fatigues and famine, had &s;ent propo&s;als of ca|pitulation, he re&s;olved upon an attempt to throw provi&s;ions into the place, by means of three victuallers, and a frigate to cover them. As &s;oon as the&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed up the river, the eyes of all were fixed upon them; the be&s;iegers eager to de&s;troy, and the garri&s;on as re&s;olute for their defence. The foremo&s;t of the victual|lers at the fir&s;t &s;hock broke the boom, but was &s;tranded by the violence of her own &s;hock. Upon this, a &s;hout bur&s;t from the be&s;iegers, which reached the camp and the city. They advanced with fury again&s;t a prize, which they con&s;idered as inevitable; while the &s;moke of the cannon on both &s;ides wraped the whole &s;cene in darkne&s;s. But to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all, in a little time the victualler was &s;een emerging from imminent danger, having got off by the rebound of her own guns, while &s;he led up her little &s;quadron to the very walls of the town. The joy of the inhabitants at this unexpected relief, was only equalled by the rage and di&s;appointment of the be&s;iegers. The
<PB N="59" REF="61">
army of James was &s;o di&s;pirited by the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize, that they abandoned the &s;iege in the night; and retired with precipita|tion, after having lo&s;t above nine thou&s;and men before the place. Kirke no &s;ooner took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town&punc; than Walker was prevailed on to embark for England, with an addre&s;s of thanks to king William, for the &s;ea&s;onable re|lief they had received.</P>
<P>The Inni&s;killiners were no le&s;s remarkable than the former for the valour and per&s;eve|rance with which they e&s;pou&s;ed the inte|re&s;ts of William. And indeed the bigotry and cruelty of the papi&s;ts upon that occa&s;ion were &s;ufficient to excite the tame&s;t into oppo&s;ition. The prote&s;tants, by an act of the popi&s;h par|liament, under king James, were dive&s;ted of tho&s;e lands which they had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ince the Iri&s;h rebellion. Three thou&s;and of that per&s;ua&s;ion, who had &s;ought &s;afety by flight, were found guilty of trea&s;on, and at|tainted. Soldiers were permitted to live upon free quarter; the people were plundered, the &s;hops of trade&s;men, and the kitchens of the citizens, were pillaged, to &s;upply a quantity of bra&s;s, which was converted into coin, and pa&s;&s;ed, by royal mandate, for above forty times its real value. Not content with this, he
<PB N="60" REF="62">
impo&s;ed, by his own authority, a tax of twenty thou&s;and pounds a month on per&s;onal proper|ty, and levied it by a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal; all vacancies in public &s;chools were &s;upplied by popi&s;h teachers. The pen&s;ion allowed from the exchequer to the Univer&s;ity of Dublin was cut off, and that in|&s;titution converted into a popi&s;h &s;eminary. Brigadier Sarsfield commanded all prote&s;tants of a certain di&s;trict to retire to the di&s;tance of ten miles from their habitations on pain of death; many peri&s;hed with hunger, &s;till more from being forced from their homes, during the &s;evere&s;t inclemencies of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But their &s;ufferings were &s;oon to have an an end. William at length perceived that his neglect of Ireland had been an error that re|quired more than u&s;ual diligence to redre&s;s. He was afraid to &s;end the late king's army to fight again&s;t him, and therefore ordered twenty-three new regiments to be rai&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e. The&s;e, with two Dutch batallions, and four of French refugees, together with the Inni&s;killiners, were appointed for the reduction of Ireland; and next to king William him&s;elf, Schomberg was appointed to command.</P>
<P>Schomberg was a Dutchman, who had long been the faithful &s;ervant of William, and had
<PB N="61" REF="63">
now pa&s;t a life of eighty years almo&s;t continu|ally in the field. The method of carrying on the war in Ireland, however, was a mode of operation with which he was entirely unac|quainted. The forces he had to combat were incur&s;ive, barbarous, and &s;hy; tho&s;e he had to command were tumultuary, ungovernable, and brave. He con&s;idered not the dangers which threatened the health of his troops by being confined to one place; and he kept them in a low moi&s;t camp, near Dundalk, without firing almo&s;t of any kind; &s;o that the men fell into fevers and fluxes, and died in great abundance. The enemy were not le&s;s afflicted with &s;imilar di&s;orders. Both camps remained for &s;ome time in &s;ight of each other, and at la&s;t the rainy &s;ea&s;on approaching, they both, as if by mutual agreement, quitted their camps at the &s;ame time, and retired into winter-quarters, without attempting to take the advantage of each other's retreat.</P>
<P>The bad &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign, and the mi&s;erable &s;ituation of the prote&s;tants in Ire|land, at length induced king William to at|tempt their relief in per&s;on, at the opening of the en&s;uing &s;pring; and accordingly landed at Carrickfergus, where he found him&s;elf at the head of an army of &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and
<PB N="62" REF="64">
effective men, which was more than a match for the forces of James, although they amount|ed to above ten thou&s;and more.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1690" UNIT="A.D."> William having received news that the French fleet was &s;ailed for the coa&s;t of Eng|land, re&s;olved, by mea&s;ures of &s;peed and vi|gour, to prevent the impre&s;&s;ion which that cir|cum&s;tance might make upon the minds of his &s;oldiers; and therefore ha&s;tened to advance again&s;t James, who he heard had quitted Dublin, and had &s;tationed his army at Ardee and Dundalk.</P>
<P>All the mea&s;ures taken by William were dictated by prudence and valour, tho&s;e pur|&s;ued by his opponents &s;eemed dictated by ob|&s;tinacy and infatuation. They neglected to harra&s;s him in his difficult march from the north; they neglected to oppo&s;e him at the &s;trong pa&s;s at Newry; as he advanced they fell back fir&s;t from Dundalk, and then from Ardee; and at la&s;t, upon the twenty-ninth of June, they fixed their camp in a &s;trong &s;tation, on the other &s;ide of the Boyne. It was upon the oppo&s;ite banks of this river that both ar|mies came in &s;ight of each other, inflamed with all the animo&s;ities ari&s;ing from religion, hatred, and revenge. The river Boyne at this place was not &s;o deep, but that men might wade over on
<PB N="63" REF="65">
foot; however the banks were rugged, and rendered dangerous by old hou&s;es and ditches, which &s;erved to defend the latent enemy. William had no &s;ooner arrived, but he rode along the &s;ide of the river, in &s;ight of both armies, to make proper ob&s;ervations upon the plan of battle; but in the mean time being perceived by the enemy, a cannon was private|ly brought out, and planted again&s;t him, where he was &s;itting. The &s;hot killed &s;everal of his followers; and he him&s;elf was wounded in the &s;houlder. The news of his being &s;lain was in&s;tantly propogated through the Iri&s;h camp, and was even &s;ent off to Paris; but William, as &s;oon as his wound was dre&s;&s;ed, rode through the camp and quickly undeceiv|ed his army.</P>
<P>Upon retiring to his tent, after the danger of the day, he continued in meditation till nine o'clock at night, when, for form &s;ake, he &s;um|moned a council of war, in which without a&s;king advice, he declared his re&s;olution to force a pa&s;&s;age over the river the next morn|ing. The duke of Schomberg attempted at fir&s;t to expo&s;tulate with him upon the danger of the undertaking; but finding his ma&s;ter in|flexible, he retired to his tent with a di&s;con|tented
<PB N="64" REF="66">
a&s;pect, as if he had a pre&s;cience of his own misfortune.</P>
<P>Early in the morning at &s;ix o'clock, king William gave orders to force a pa&s;s over the river. This the army undertook in three different places; and after a furious cannonad|ing, the battle began with unu&s;ual vigour. The Iri&s;h troops, though reckoned the be&s;t in Europe abroad, have always fought indifferent|ly at home. After an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, they fled with precipitation; leaving the French and Swi&s;s regiments, who came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make the be&s;t retreat they could. William led on his hor&s;e in per&s;on; and contributed, by his activity and vigilance, to &s;ecure the victory. James was not in the battle, but &s;tood aloof, during the action, on the hill of Dunmore, &s;urrounded with &s;ome &s;quadrons of hor&s;e; and at intervals was heard to exclaim, when he &s;aw his own troops repul&s;|ing tho&s;e of the enemy,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O &s;pare my Eng|li&s;h &s;ubjects."</Q></P>
<P>The Iri&s;h lo&s;t about fifteen hundred men, and the prote&s;tants about one third of that number. The victory was &s;plendid and almo&s;t deci&s;ive; but the death of the duke of Schom|berg, who was &s;hot as he was cro&s;&s;ing the wa|ter,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
&s;eemed to outweigh the whole lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the enemy. This old &s;oldier of fortune had fought under almo&s;t every power in Eu|rope. His &s;kill in war was unparelleled, and his fidelity equal to his courage. The number of battles in which he had been per&s;onally en|gaged, was &s;aid to equal the number of his years, and he died at the age of eighty-two. He was killed by a di&s;charge from his own troops, who, not knowing that he had been accidentally hurried into the mid&s;t of the ene|my, fired upon the body of men by whom he was &s;urrounded, and mortally wounded him.</P>
<P>James, while his armies were yet fighting, quitted his &s;tation; and leaving orders to de|fend the pa&s;s at Duleak, he made the be&s;t of his way to Dublin, de&s;paring of future &s;ucce&s;s. O'Regan, an old Iri&s;h captain, was heard to &s;ay upon this occa&s;ion, that if the Engli&s;h would exchange generals, the conquered army would fight the battle with them over again.</P>
<P>This blow totally depre&s;&s;ed the hopes of James. He fled to Dublin, advi&s;ed the ma|gi&s;trates to obtain the be&s;t terms they could from the victor, and then &s;et out for Water|ford, where he embarked for France, in a ve&s;|&s;el fitted for his reception. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either conduct or courage, he might &s;till have
<PB N="66" REF="68">
headed his troops, and fought with advantage; but prudence for&s;ook him with good fortune, and he returned to retrieve his affairs abroad, while he de&s;erted them in the only place they were defen&s;ible.</P>
<P>His friends, however, were determined to &s;econd tho&s;e intere&s;ts which he him&s;elf had abandoned. Limerick, a &s;trong city in the province of Mun&s;ter, &s;till held out for the late king, and braved all the attempts of William's army to reduce it. Sarsfield, a popular and experienced general, put him&s;elf at the head of the army that had been routed at the Boyne, and went farther into the country to defend the banks of the river Shannon, where he re|&s;olved to await the enemy. James, however, who would not defend the country him&s;elf, determined that none but &s;uch as were agree|able to him &s;hould defend it. He, therefore, appointed St. Ruth, a French general, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf again&s;t the prote&s;tants in France, to command over Sarsfield, which gave the Iri&s;h univer&s;al di&s;content, as it &s;hewed the king could neither rely on their &s;kill or their fidelity. On the orther hand, general Ginckle, who had been appointed to com|mand the Engli&s;h army in the ab&s;ence of Wil|liam, who was gone over to England, advanced
<PB N="67" REF="69">
with his forces to meet the enemy towards the Shannon, in order to pa&s;s that broad and dan|gerous river. The only place where it was fordable, was at Athlone, a &s;trong walled town, built on both &s;ides of the river, and defending that important pa&s;s. The part of the town on the hither &s;ide of the river was quickly taken &s;word in hand by the Engli&s;h; but the part on the oppo&s;ite bank being defended with great vigour, for a while was thought impregnable. At length it was re&s;olved, in a council of war, that a body of forelorn hope &s;hould ford the &s;tream in the face of the enemy, which de&s;pe|rate attempt was performed with great re&s;olu|tion; the enemy were driven from their works, and the town &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. St. Ruth marched his army to give relief, but too late; for when he approached the walls, his own guns were turned again&s;t him. He no &s;ooner &s;aw this than his fears encrea&s;ed in pro|portion to his former confidence; and dreading the impetuo&s;ity of a victorious enemy in his very camp, he marched off in&s;tantly, and took po&s;t at Aughrim, ten miles off. There he de|termined to await the Engli&s;h army, and de|cide the fate of Ireland at one blow.</P>
<P>Ginckle, having put Athlone in a po&s;ture of defence, pa&s;&s;ed the Shannon, and marched up
<PB N="68" REF="70">
to the enemy, determined to give them bat|tle, though his forces did not exceed eighteen thou&s;and men, while that of the enemy was above twenty-five thou&s;and.<MILESTONE N="1691" UNIT="A.D."> The Iri&s;h were po&s;ted in a very advantageous &s;ituation, being drawn out upon a ri&s;ing ground, before which lay a bog that, to appearance, was pa&s;&s;able only in two places. Their right was fortified by en|trenchments, and their left &s;ecured by the ca&s;|tle of Aughrim. Ginckle having ob&s;erved their &s;ituation, gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for attack; and, after a furious cannonading, the Engli&s;h army at twelve o'clock began to force the two pa&s;&s;ages of the bog, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ground on the other &s;ide. The enemy fought with &s;urpri&s;ing fury, and the hor&s;e were &s;everal times repul&s;ed; but at length the troops on the right, by the help of &s;ome field-pieces, carried their point. At &s;ix o'clock in the evening the left wing of the Engli&s;h army was advanced to the right of the Iri&s;h, and at length obliged it to give ground. In the mean time a more general attack was made upon the center; the Engli&s;h wading through the middle of the bog up to the wa&s;te in mud, and rallying with &s;ome difficulty on the firm ground on the other &s;ide, renewed the com|bat with great fury. At length St. Ruth being
<PB N="69" REF="71">
killed by a cannon-ball, his fate &s;o di&s;pirited his troops, that they gave way on all &s;ides, and retreated to Limerick, where they re|&s;olved to make a final &s;tand, after having lo&s;t above five thou&s;and of the flower of their army. Limerick, the la&s;t retreat of the Iri&s;h forces, made a brave defence; but &s;oon &s;eeing the enemy advanced within ten paces of the bridge foot, and perceiving them&s;elves &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, they determined to capitulate; a negociation was immediately be|gun, and ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed on both &s;ides. The Roman catholics by this capitulation were re|&s;tored to the enjoyment of tho&s;e liberties in the exerci&s;e of their religion, which they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the reign of king Charles the &s;e|cond. All per&s;ons were indulged with free leave to remove with their families and effects to any other country, except England and Scotland. In con&s;equence of this, about four|teen thou&s;and of tho&s;e who had fought for king James went over into France, having tran&s;ports provided by government for con|veying them thither. When they arrived in France they were thanked for their loyalty by king James, who told them that they &s;hould &s;till fight for their old ma&s;ter; and that he had obtained an order from the king of France
<PB N="70" REF="72">
for their being new cloathed, and put into quarters of refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>In this manner all the expectations which might ari&s;e from the attachment of the Iri&s;h were entirely at an end; that kingdom &s;ub|mitted peaceably to the Engli&s;h government, and James was to look for other a&s;&s;i&s;tance to prop his declining preten&s;ions. His chief hopes lay in a con&s;piracy among his Engli&s;h adherents, and in the &s;uccours which were promi&s;ed him by the French king. The &s;ucce&s;s of the con|&s;piracy was the fir&s;t to di&s;appoint his expecta|tions. This was originally hatched in Scot|land by Sir James Montgomery, a per&s;on who, from being an adherent to William, now turn|ed again&s;t him; but as the project was ill con|ceived, &s;o it was as lightly di&s;covered by the in&s;tigator. To this another &s;ucceeded, which &s;eemed to threaten more &s;erious con&s;equences, as it was chiefly managed by the Whig party, who were the mo&s;t formidable in the &s;tate. A number of the&s;e joined them&s;elves to the Tory party, and both made advances to the adherents of the late king. They a&s;&s;embled together; and the re&s;ult of their deliberations was, that the re&s;toration of James was to be entirely effected by foreign forces; that he &s;hould &s;ail for Scotland, and be there joined
<PB N="71" REF="73">
by five thou&s;and Swedes, who, becau&s;e they were of the prote&s;tant religion, it was thought would remove a part of the odium which at|tended an inva&s;ion by foreigners; that a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance &s;hould at the &s;ame time be &s;ent from France, and that full liberty of con&s;cience &s;hould be proclaimed throughout the king|dom. In order to lo&s;e no time, it was re&s;olved to &s;end over two tru&s;ty per&s;ons to France to con&s;ult with the bani&s;hed monarch; and lord Pre&s;ton and Mr. A&s;hton were the per&s;ons ap|pointed for this dangerous emba&s;&s;y. Accord|ingly A&s;hton hired a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el for this pur|po&s;e; and the two con&s;pirators went &s;ecretly on board, happy in the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ecrecy of their &s;chemes; but there had been previous information given of their intentions; and lord Carmarthen had them both &s;eized, ju&s;t at the time they thought them&s;elves out of all danger. The con&s;pirators refu&s;ed to inform; their trials were therefore hurried on about a fortnight after they were taken, in order, by the terrors of death, to force a di&s;covery. They were both condemned; A&s;hton was ex|ecuted, without making any confe&s;&s;ion; lord Pre&s;ton had not the &s;ame re&s;olution. Upon an offer of a pardon he di&s;covered a great number of a&s;&s;ociates, among whom the duke
<PB N="72" REF="74">
of Ormond, lord Dartmouth, and lord Cla|rendon were foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>The reduction of Ireland, and the wretched &s;ucce&s;s of the late con&s;piracy, made the French at la&s;t &s;en&s;ible of their impolitic par&s;imony in lo&s;ing a kingdom, who&s;e divi&s;ions would no longer be of u&s;e to them. They were willing, therefore, to concur with the fugitive king, and re&s;olved to make a de&s;cent upon England in his favour. In pur&s;uance of this &s;cheme, the French king &s;upplied James with an army con&s;i&s;ting of a body of French troops, &s;ome Engli&s;h and Scotch refugees, and the Iri&s;h re|giments, which had been tran&s;ported from Limerick into France, now become excellent &s;oldiers by long di&s;cipline and &s;evere duty. This army was a&s;&s;embled between Cherbourg and La Hogue, and was commanded by king James in per&s;on. More than three hundred tran&s;ports were provided for landing it on the oppo&s;ite Engli&s;h coa&s;t; and Tourville, the French admiral, at the head of &s;ixty-three &s;hips of the line, was appointed to favour the de&s;cent. His orders were, at all events, to attack the enemy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould oppo&s;e him; &s;o that every thing promi&s;ed the ba|ni&s;hed king a change of fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="75">The&s;e preparations on the &s;ide of France were &s;oon known at the Engli&s;h court, and every precaution taken for a vigorous oppo|&s;ition.<MILESTONE N="1692" UNIT="A.D."> All the &s;ecret machinations of the ba|ni&s;hed king's adherents were di&s;covered to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try by &s;pies; and by the&s;e they found, with &s;ome mortification, that the To|ries were more faithful than even the Whigs, who had placed king William on the throne. The duke of Marlborough, lord Godolphin, and even the prince&s;s Anne her&s;elf, were vio|lently &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection; the fleet, the army, and the church, were &s;een mi&s;tak|ing their de&s;ire of novelty for a return of duty to their bani&s;hed &s;overeign. However, preparations were made to re&s;i&s;t the growing &s;torm with great tranquillity and re&s;olution. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el was ordered to put to &s;ea with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; and he &s;oon appeared with ninety-nine &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides fri|gates and fire-&s;hips; an immen&s;e force, and what Europe had &s;eldom &s;een till that time. At the head of this formidable &s;quadron he &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of France, and at la&s;t, near La Hogue, di&s;covered the enemy under admiral Tourville, who prepared to give him battle. Accordingly the engagement began between the two admirals with great fury; the re&s;t of
<PB N="74" REF="76">
the fleet on each &s;ide &s;oon followed the exam|ple. This memorable engagement la&s;ted for ten hours, and all James's hopes depended on the event. Victory at la&s;t declared on the &s;ide of numbers; the French fled for Conquet Road, having lo&s;t four &s;hips in the fir&s;t day's action. The pur&s;uit continued for two days following; three French &s;hips of the line were de&s;troyed the next day, and eighteen more burned by Sir George Rooke, which had taken refuge in the bay of La Hogue. In this man|ner all the preparations on the &s;ide of France were fru&s;trated; and &s;o deci&s;ive was the blow, that from that time France &s;eemed to relin|qui&s;h all their claims to the ocean.</P>
<P>James was now reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb of de&s;pondence, his de&s;igns upon England were quite fru&s;trated, &s;o that nothing was left his friends, but the hopes of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the monarch on the throne. The&s;e ba&s;e attempts, as barbarous as they were u&s;ele&s;s, were not en|tirely di&s;agreeable to the temper of James. It is &s;aid he encouraged and propo&s;ed them; but they all proved un&s;erviceable to his cau&s;e, and only ended in the de&s;truction of the un|dertakers. From that time till he died, which was about &s;even years, he continued to re&s;ide at St. Germains, a pen&s;ioner on the bounties of
<PB N="75" REF="77">
Lewis, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by occa&s;ional liberalities from his daughter and friends in England. He died on the &s;ixteenth day of September, in the year 1700, after having laboured under a te|dious &s;ickne&s;s, and many miracles, as the peo|ple thought, were wrought at his tomb. In|deed the latter part of his life, was calculated to in&s;pire the &s;uper&s;titious with reverence for his piety. He &s;ubjected him&s;elf to acts of un|common penance and mortification. He fre|quently vi&s;ited the poor monks of La Trappe, who were edified by his humble and pious de|portment. His pride and arbitrary temper, &s;eemed to have vani&s;hed with his greatne&s;s; he became affable, kind, and ea&s;y, to all his de|pendents; and in his la&s;t illne&s;s, conjured his &s;on to prefer religion to every wordly advan|tage, a coun&s;el which that prince &s;trictly obey|ed. He died with great marks of devotion, and was interred, at his own reque&s;t, in the church of the Engli&s;h Benedictines at Paris, without any funeral &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>The defeat at La Hogue confirmed king William's &s;afety, and &s;ecured his title to the crown. The Jacobites were ever feeble, but they were now a di&s;united faction; new par|ties aro&s;e among tho&s;e who had been friends to the revolution, and the want of a common
<PB N="76" REF="78">
enemy, produced di&s;&s;en&s;ions among them&s;elves. William now began to find as much oppo&s;i|tion and unea&s;ine&s;s from his parliament at home, as from the enemy in the field. His chief motive for accepting the crown, was to engage England more deeply in the concerns of Europe. It had ever been the object of his wi&s;h, and the &s;cope of his ambition to humble the French, whom he con&s;idered as the mo&s;t formidable enemies of that liberty which he idolized; and all his politics con&s;i&s;ted in form|ing alliances again&s;t them. Many of the Eng|li&s;h, on the other hand, had neither the &s;ame animo&s;ity again&s;t the French, nor the &s;ame terrors of their encrea&s;ing power. The&s;e, there|fore, con&s;idered the intere&s;t of the nation as &s;acrificed to foreign connections; and com|plained that the war on the continent fell mo&s;t heavily on them, though they had the lea&s;t intere&s;t in its &s;ucce&s;s. To the&s;e motives of di&s;content were added the king's partiality to his own countrymen, in prejudice of his Eng|li&s;h &s;ubjects, together with his proud re&s;erve and &s;ullen &s;ilence, &s;o unlike the behaviour of all their former kings. William, however, little regarded tho&s;e di&s;contents, which he knew mu&s;t be con&s;equent on all government; accu&s;|tomed to oppo&s;ition, he heard their complaints

with the mo&s;t phlegmatic indifference, and employed all his attention only on the balance of power, and the intere&s;ts of Europe. Thus while he ince&s;&s;antly waked over the &s;chemes of contending kings and nations, he was un|mindful of the cultivation of internal poli|ty; and as he formed alliances abroad, en|crea&s;ed the influence of party at home. Pa|trioti&s;m began to be ridiculed as an ideal vir|tue, the practice of bribing a majority in par|liament became univer&s;al. The example of the great was caught up by the vulgar; prin|ciple, and even decency, was gradually bani&s;h|ed; talents lay uncultivated, and the igno|rant and profligate were received into favour.</P>
<P>Upon accepting of the crown, the king was re&s;olved to pre&s;erve, as much as he was able, that &s;hare of prerogative which &s;till was left him. He was as yet entirely unacquainted with the nature of a limited monarchy, which was not at that time thoroughly under&s;tood in any part of Europe, except England alone. He, therefore, often controverted the views of his parliament, and &s;uffered him&s;elf to be di|rected by weak and arbitrary coun&s;els. One of the fir&s;t in&s;tances of this, was in the oppo&s;ition he gave to a bill for limiting the duration of parliaments to the &s;pace of three years. This
<PB N="78" REF="80">
bill had pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es, and was &s;ent up to receive the royal a&s;&s;ent as u&s;ual; but the nation was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the king was re&s;olved to exert his prerogative on this occa|&s;ion, and to refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent to an act which was then con&s;idered as beneficial to the nation. Both hou&s;es took the alarm; the commons came to a re&s;olution, that whoever advi&s;ed the king to this mea&s;ure was an enemy to his country, and the people were taught to eccho their re&s;entment. The bill thus rejected, lay dormant for another &s;ea&s;on; but being again brought in, the king found him&s;elf obliged, though reluctantly, to comply.</P>
<P>The &s;ame oppo&s;ition, and the &s;ame event, at+tended a bill for regulating trials, in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, by which the accu&s;ed was allowed a copy of his indictment, and a li&s;t of the names of his jury, two days before his trial, together with coun&s;el to plead in his defence. It was &s;till farther enacted, that no per&s;on &s;hould be in|dicted but upon the oaths of two faithful wit|ne&s;&s;es; a law that gave the &s;ubject a perfect &s;ecurity from the terrors of the throne.</P>
<P>It was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e laws, beneficial to the &s;ubject, that the Jacobites &s;till conceived hopes of re&s;toring their fallen monarch; and being unea&s;y them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ed the whole
<PB N="79" REF="81">
kingdom &s;hared their di&s;quietudes. While one part proceeded again&s;t William in the bolder manner, by attempting to excite an in&s;urrection, another, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t de&s;perate con&s;pirators, formed a &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Sir George Barclay, a native of Scotland, who had &s;erved as an officer in James's army, a man of undaunted courage, which was &s;till more enflamed by his bigotry to the religion of the church of Rome, under|took the bold ta&s;k of &s;eizing or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the king. This de&s;ign he imparted to Harri|&s;on, Charnock, Porter, and Sir William Per|kins, by whom it was approved; and after various con&s;ultations, it was re&s;olved to attack the king on his return from Richmond, where he commonly hunted on Saturdays; and the &s;cene of their ambu&s;cade was a lane be|tween Brentford and Turnham-Green. To &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s, it was agreed that their number &s;hould be encrea&s;ed to forty hor&s;emen, and each con&s;pirator began to engage proper per|&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this dangerous enterprize. When their number was complete, they wait|ed with impatience for the hour of action; but &s;ome of the under actors, &s;eized with fear or remor&s;e, re&s;olved to prevent the execution by a timely di&s;covery. One Penderga&s;t, an
<PB N="80" REF="82">
Iri&s;h officer, gave information of the plot, but refu&s;ed to mention the per&s;ons who were con|cerned as a&s;&s;ociates in the undertaking. His information was at fir&s;t di&s;regarded; but it was &s;oon confirmed by one Le Rue, a Frenchman, and &s;till more by the flight of Sir George Bar|clay, who began to perceive that the whole was di&s;covered. The night, &s;ub&s;equent to the in|tended day of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, a large number of the con&s;pirators were apprehended, and the whole di&s;covery was communicated to the pri|vy-council. Penderga&s;t became an evidence for the crown, and the con&s;pirators were brought to their trial. The fir&s;t who &s;uffer|ed, were Robert Charnock, one of the two fellows of Magdalen college, who, in the reign James, had renounced the prote&s;tant religion; lieutenant King, and Thomas Keys. They were found guilty of high trea&s;on, and &s;uffer|ed at Tyburn. Sir John Freind, and Sir Wil|liam Perkins were next arraigned; and altho' they made a very good, and as it &s;hould &s;eem a very &s;ufficient defence, yet lord chief ju&s;tice Holt, who was but too well known to act ra|ther as coun&s;el again&s;t the pri&s;oner, than as a &s;ollicitor in their favour, influenced the jury to find them guilty. They both &s;uffered at Ty|burn with great con&s;tancy, denying the charge,
<PB N="81" REF="83">
and te&s;tifying their abhorrence of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation. In the cour&s;e of the month, Rook|wood, Cranbourne, and Lowick, were tried by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion as con&s;pirators, and, being found guilty, &s;hared the fate of the for|mer. But the ca&s;e of Sir John Fenwick was con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t &s;tretches of power exhibited during this reign. This gen|tleman, who&s;e name had been mentioned a|mong the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators, was appre|hended in his way to France. There was little evidence again&s;t him, except an intercepted letter which he wrote to his wife. It is true, he offered to di&s;cover all he knew of a con|&s;piracy again&s;t the king; but when he came to enter into the detail, he &s;o managed his in|formation, that it could affect no individual concerned. King William, therefore, &s;ent over word from Holland, where he then was, that unle&s;s the pri&s;oner could make more material di&s;coveries, he &s;hould be brought to his trial. The only material evidences again&s;t him, were one Porter, and Goodman, but of the&s;e lady Fenwick had the good fortune to &s;ecrete one, &s;o that only Porter, a &s;ingle witne&s;s remained; and his un&s;upported evidence, by the late law, was in&s;ufficient to affect the life of the pri|&s;oner. However, the hou&s;e of commons were
<PB N="82" REF="84">
re&s;olved to inflict that puni&s;hment upon him, which the laws were unable to execute. As he had, in his di&s;coveries, made very free with the names of many per&s;ons in that hou&s;e, ad|miral Ru&s;&s;el in&s;i&s;ted that he might have an op|portunity of vindicating his own character in particular. Sir John Fenwick was ordered to the bar of the hou&s;e, and there exhorted by the &s;peaker to make an ample di&s;covery. He refu&s;ed, and a bill of attainder was preferred again&s;t him, which was pa&s;&s;ed by a large ma|jority. He was furni&s;hed with a copy of the indictment, allowed coun&s;el at the bar of the hou&s;e, and the coun&s;el of the crown was called upon to open the evidence. After much di&s;|putation, where pa&s;&s;ion and revenge, was ra|ther attended to than rea&s;on, the bill was com|mitted, and &s;ent up to the hou&s;e lords, where Sir John Fenwick was found guilty, by a ma|jority only of &s;even voices. The pri&s;oner &s;ol|licited the mediation of the lords in his be|half, while his friends implored the royal mercy. The lords gave him to under&s;tand, that the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;uit would depend on the full|ne&s;s of his di&s;coveries. He would have pre|viou&s;ly &s;tipulated for pardon, and they in&s;i&s;ted on his tru&s;ting to their favour. He he&s;ita|ted &s;ome time, between the fears of infamy
<PB N="83" REF="85">
and the terrors of death. At la&s;t he cho&s;e death as the lea&s;t terrible, and he &s;uffered beheading on Tower-hill with great compo&s;ure. His death proved the in&s;ufficiency of any laws to protect the &s;ubject, when a majority of the powerful &s;hall think proper to di&s;pen&s;e with them!</P>
<P>This &s;tretch of power in the parliament was in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated by their dili|gence in re&s;training the univer&s;al corruption that &s;eemed at that time to prevail over the kingdom. They were a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in bringing tho&s;e to ju&s;tice who had grown wealthy by public plunder, and increa&s;ing the number of tho&s;e laws which re&s;trained the arts of peculation. The number of the&s;e, while they &s;eemed calculated for the benefit of the nation, were in reality &s;ymptoms of the general depravity; for the more numerous the laws, the more corrupt the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The king, however, on his part became at length fatigued with oppo&s;ing the laws, which parlia|ment every day were laying round his authority, and gave up the conte&s;t. He admitted every re|&s;traint upon the prerogative in England, upon condition of being properly &s;upplied with the means of humbling the power of France. War, and the balance of power in Europe, where all he
<PB N="84" REF="86">
knew, or indeed de&s;ired to under&s;tand. Pro|vided the parliament furni&s;hed him with &s;up|plies for the&s;e purpo&s;es, he permitted them to rule the internal polity at their plea&s;ure. For the pro&s;ecution of the war with France, the &s;ums of money granted him were incredi|ble. The nation, not contented with furni&s;h|ing him &s;uch &s;ums of money as they were ca|pable of rai&s;ing by the taxes of the year, mort|gaged tho&s;e taxes, and involved them&s;elves in debts, which they have never &s;ince been able to di&s;charge. For all that profu&s;ion of wealth granted to maintain the imaginary balance of Europe, England received in return the empty reward of military glory in Flanders, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having given their allies, par|ticularly the Dutch, frequent opportunities of being ungrateful.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1697" UNIT="A.D."> The war with France continued during the greate&s;t part of this king's reign; but at length the treaty of Ry&s;wick put an end to tho&s;e con|tentions, in which England had engaged with|out policy, and came off without advantage. In the general pacification, her intere&s;ts &s;eemed entirely de&s;erted; and for all the trea&s;ures &s;he had &s;ent to the continent, and all the blood which &s;he had &s;hed there, the only equivalent &s;he received was an acknowledgement of king William's title from the king of France.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">The king, now freed from a foreign war, laid him&s;elf out to &s;trengthen his authority at home; but he &s;hewed that he was but ill acquainted with the di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple he was to govern. As he could not bear the thoughts of being a king without military command, he conceived hopes of keeping up the forces that were granted him in time of danger, during the continuance of a profound peace. But what was his mortifica|tion to find the commons pa&s;s a vote, that all the forces in Engli&s;h pay, exceeding &s;even thou&s;and men, &s;hould be forthwith di&s;|banded, and that tho&s;e retained &s;hould be na|tural-born &s;ubjects of England. A monarch bred up in camps as he was, and who knew &s;carce any other plea&s;ure but that of reviewing troops, and dictating to generals, could not think of laying down at once all his power and all his amu&s;ements. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf therefore, highly di&s;plea&s;ed with the vote of the commons; and his indignation was kindled to &s;uch a pitch, that he actually con|ceived a de&s;ign of abandoning the government. His mini&s;ters, however, diverted him from this re&s;olution, and per&s;uaded him to con&s;ent to pa&s;&s;ing the bill.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">The&s;e altercations between the king and parliament continued during the remainder of this reign. William con&s;idered the commons as a body of men de&s;irous of power for them|&s;elves, and con&s;equently bent upon ob&s;tructing all his projects to &s;ecure the liberties of Eu|rope. He &s;eemed but little attached to any particular party in the hou&s;e, all of whom he found at times de&s;erted or oppo&s;ed him. He therefore veered to Whigs and Tories indi&s;|criminately, as intere&s;t, or the immediate exi|gence demanded. He was taught to con&s;ider England as a place of labour, anxiety, and al|tercation. If he had any time for amu&s;ement or relaxation, he retired to Loo in Holland, where, among a few friends, he gave a loo&s;e to tho&s;e coar&s;e fe&s;tivities, which alone he was capable of reli&s;hing. It was there he planned the different &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the princes of Europe, and la|boured to undermine the &s;chemes and the power of Lewis, his rival in politics and in fame.</P>
<P>However feeble his de&s;ire of other amu&s;e|ments might have been, he could &s;carce live without being at variance with France. Peace had &s;carce been made with that nation, when he began to think of new re&s;ources for carry|ing on a new war, and for enli&s;ting his Engli&s;h
<PB N="87" REF="89">
&s;ubjects in the confederacy again&s;t that nation. Several arts were u&s;ed for inducing the people to &s;econd his aims; and the whole nation at la&s;t &s;eemed to join in de&s;iring a war with that kingdom. He had been in Holland, concert|ing with his allies operations for a new cam|paign. He had engaged in a negociation with the prince of He&s;&s;e, who a&s;&s;ured him, that if he would be&s;iege and take Cadiz, the admiral of Ca&s;tile, and divers other grandees of Spain, would declare for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The elector of Hanover had re&s;olved to concur in the &s;ame mea&s;ures; the king of the Romans, and prince Lewis of Baden, undertook to in|ve&s;t Laudan, while the emperor promi&s;ed to &s;end a powerful reinforcement into Italy; but death put a period to his projects and his ambition.</P>
<P>William was naturally of a very feeble con|&s;titution; and it was by this time almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted, by a &s;eries of continual di&s;quietude and action. He had endeavoured to repair his con&s;titution, or at lea&s;t conceal its decays, by exerci&s;e and riding. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of February, in riding to Hampton-Court from Ken&s;ington, his hor&s;e fell under him, and he was thrown with &s;uch violence, that his col|lar bone was fractured. His attendants con|veyed
<PB N="88" REF="90">
him to the palace of Hampton court, where the fracture was reduced, and in the evening he returned to Ken&s;ington in his coach. The jolting of the carriage di&s;united the frac|ture once more; and the bones were again replaced, under Bidloo his phy&s;ician. This in a robu&s;t con&s;titution would have been a trifling misfortune; but in him it was fatal. For &s;ome time he appeared in a fair way of recovery; but falling a&s;leep on his couch, he was &s;eized with a &s;hivering, which terminat|ed in a fever and diarrhaea, which &s;oon be|came dangerous and de&s;perate. Perceiving his end approaching, the objects of his former care lay &s;till next his heart; and the fate of Europe &s;eemed to remove the &s;en&s;ations he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel for his own. The earl of Albermarle arriving from Holland, he conferred with him in private on the po&s;ture of affairs abroad. Two days after having re|ceived the &s;acrament from archbi&s;hop Teni&s;on, he expired in the fifty-&s;econd year of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. He was in his per&s;on of a middle &s;tature, a thin body, and a delicate con&s;titution. He had an aqui|line no&s;e, &s;parkling eyes, a large forehead, and a grave &s;olemn a&s;pect. He left behind him the character of a great politician, though he
<PB N="89" REF="91">
had never been popular; and a formidable general, though he was &s;eldom victorious. His deportment was grave, phlegmatic, and &s;ullen; nor did he ever &s;hew any fire but in the day of battle. He de&s;pi&s;ed flattery, yet loved do|minion. Greater as the &s;tadtholder of Holland than as king of England; to the one he was a father, to the other a &s;u&s;picious friend. His character and &s;ucce&s;s &s;erve to &s;hew, that mode|rate abilities will atchieve the greate&s;t purpo|&s;es, if the objects aimed at be pur&s;ued with per|&s;everance, and planned without unnece&s;&s;ary or o&s;tentatious refinement.</P>

<P>THE nearer we approach to our own times, the more important every occurrence becomes; and tho&s;e battles or treaties which in remoter times are de&s;ervedly forgot|ten, as we come down are nece&s;&s;ary to be known. Our own private intere&s;ts being gene|rally blended with every event; and the ac|counts of public welfare make often a tran|&s;cript

of private happine&s;s. The lo&s;s of king William was thought at fir&s;t irreparable; but the kingdom &s;oon found that the happine&s;s of any reign is to be e&s;timated as much from the ge|neral manners of the times, as the private vir|tues of the monarch. Queen Anne, his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or, with no very &s;hining talents, and few ex|alted virtues, yet governed with glory, and left her people happy.</P>
<P>Anne, married to prince George of Den|mark, a&s;cended the throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, to the general &s;atisfaction of all parties. She was the &s;econd daughter of king James by his fir&s;t wife, the daugh|ter of chancellor Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon. As &s;he had been taught in the preceding part of life to &s;uffer many mortifi|cations from the reigning king, &s;he had thus learned to conceal her re&s;entments; and the natural tranquillity of her temper &s;till more contributed to make her overlook and pardon every oppo&s;ition. She either was in&s;en&s;ible of any di&s;re&s;pect &s;hewn her, or had wi&s;dom to di&s;&s;emble in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The late king, who&s;e whole life had been &s;pent in one continued oppo&s;ition to the king of France, and all who&s;e politics con&s;i&s;ted in forming alliances again&s;t him, had left Eng|land
<PB N="92" REF="94">
at the eve of a war with that monarch. The pre&s;ent queen, who generally took the advice of her mini&s;try in every important tran&s;action, was upon this occa&s;ion urged by oppo&s;ing coun&s;els; a part of her mini&s;try were for war, while another part as &s;incerely de|clared for peace.</P>
<P>At the head of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed a war with France was the earl of Roche&s;ter, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, fir&s;t cou&s;in to the queen, and the chief of the Tory faction. This mi|ni&s;ter propo&s;ed in council that the Engli&s;h &s;hould avoid a declaration of war with France, and at mo&s;t act as auxiliaries only. He urged the impo&s;&s;ibility of England's reaping any advantage by the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ucce&s;s upon the continent, and expo&s;ed the folly of loading the nation with debts to encrea&s;e the riches of its commercial rivals.</P>
<P>In the van of tho&s;e who declared for pro&s;e|cuting the late king's intentions of going to war with France, was the earl, &s;ince better known by the title of the duke of Marlbo|rough. This nobleman had begun life as a court page, and was rai&s;ed by king James to a peerage. Having de&s;erted his old ma&s;ter he attached him&s;elf in appearance to king Wil|liam; but had &s;till a &s;ecret partiality in fa|vour
<PB N="93" REF="95">
of the Tories, from whom he had re|ceived his fir&s;t employments. Ever willing to thwart and undermine the mea&s;ures of Wil|liam, he became a favourite of Anne for that very rea&s;on; &s;he loved a man who &s;till pro|fe&s;&s;ed reverence and veneration for her father, and paid the utmo&s;t attention to her&s;elf. But Marlborough had &s;till another hold upon the queen's affections and e&s;teem. He was mar|ried to a lady who was the queen's peculiar confidante, and who governed her in every ac|tion of life with unbounded authority. By this canal Marlborough actually directed the queen in all her re&s;olutions; and while his ri|vals &s;trove to advance their reputation in the council, he was more effectually &s;ecuring it in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>It was not, therefore, without private rea|&s;ons that Marlborough inclined for war. It fir&s;t gave him an opportunity of taking a dif|ferent &s;ide of the que&s;tion from the earl of Roche&s;ter, who&s;e influence he de&s;ired to le&s;&s;en; but he had in the next place hopes of being appointed general of the forces that &s;hould be &s;ent over to the continent, a command that would gra|tify his ambition in all its varieties. He therefore ob&s;erved in council, that the honour of the nation was concerned to fulfil the late king's engage|ments.
<PB N="94" REF="96">
He affirmed, that France could ne|ver be reduced within due bounds, unle&s;s England would enter as a principal in the quar|rel. His opinion, therefore, preponderated; the queen re&s;olved to declare war, and com|municated her intentions to the hou&s;e of com|mons, by whom it was approved, and war was proclaimed accordingly.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV. once arrived at the &s;ummit of glory, but long &s;ince grown familiar with di&s;|appointment and di&s;grace, &s;till kept &s;purring on an exhau&s;ted kingdom to &s;econd the views of his ambition. He now, therefore, upon the death of William expected to enter upon a field open for conque&s;ts and fame. The vi|gilance of his late rival had bla&s;ted all his lau|rels, and circum&s;cribed his power; for even though defeated, William &s;till was formidable. At the news of his death, therefore, the French monarch could not &s;uppre&s;s his rapture; and his court at Ver&s;ailles &s;eemed to have forgot|ten their u&s;ual decency in the effu&s;ions of their &s;atisfaction. The people of Paris openly re|joiced at the event; and the whole kingdom te&s;tified their rapture by every public demon|&s;tration of joy. But their plea&s;ure was &s;oon to have an end. A much more formidable enemy was now ri&s;ing up to oppo&s;e them; a
<PB N="95" REF="97">
more refined politician, a more &s;kilful general, backed by the confidence of an indulgent mi&s;|tre&s;s, and the efforts of a willing nation.</P>
<P>The king of France was, in the queen's declaration of war, taxed with having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of the Spani&s;h do|minions, with de&s;igning to invade the liberties of Europe, to ob&s;truct the freedom of naviga|tion and commerce; and with having offered an unpardonable in&s;ult to the queen and her throne, by acknowledging the title of the pre|tender. He was accu&s;ed of attempting to unite the crown of Spain to his own dominions, by placing his grand&s;on upon the throne of that kingdom, and thus of endeavouring to de|&s;troy the equality of power that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the &s;tates of Europe.</P>
<P>This declaration of war on the part of the Engli&s;h, was &s;econded by &s;imilar declarations by the Dutch and Germans, all on the &s;ame day. The French monarch could not &s;up|pre&s;s his anger at &s;uch a combination, but his chief re&s;entment fell upon the Dutch. He declared, with great emotion, that as for tho&s;e gentlemen pedlars, the Dutch, they &s;hould one day repent their in&s;olence and pre&s;umption, in declaring war again&s;t one who&s;e power they had formerly felt and dreaded. However, the
<PB N="96" REF="98">
affairs of the allies were no way influenced by his threats. Marlborough had his views gra|tified, in being appointed general of the Eng|li&s;h forces; and he was &s;till farther flattered by the Dutch, who, though the earl of Ath|lone had a right to &s;hare the command, ap|pointed Marlborough generali&s;&s;imo of the al|lied army. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that few men &s;hone more, either in debate or ac|tion, than he; &s;erene in the mid&s;t of danger, and indefatigable in the cabinet; &s;o that he became the mo&s;t formidable enemy to France that England had produced, &s;ince the conquer|ing times of Cre&s;&s;y and Agincourt.</P>
<P>A great part of the hi&s;tory of this reign, con&s;i&s;ts in battles fought upon the continent, which though of very little advantage to the intere&s;ts of the nation, were very great addi|tions to its honour. The&s;e triumphs, it is true, are pa&s;&s;ed away, and nothing remains of them; but they are too recent to be omitted in &s;i|lence, and the fame of them, though it be empty, &s;till continues to be loud.</P>
<P>The duke of Marlborough had learned the fir&s;t rudiments of the art of war, under the fa|mous mar&s;hal Turenne, having been a volun|teer in his army. He was at fir&s;t, rather more remarkable for the beauty of his per&s;on, than
<PB N="97" REF="99">
the greatne&s;s of his talents, and he went, in the French camp, by the name of the Hand&s;ome Engli&s;hman; but Turenne, who &s;aw deeper into mankind, perceived the &s;uperiority of his talents, and progno&s;ticated his future great|ne&s;s. The fir&s;t attempt that Marlborough made to deviate from the general practices of the army, which were founded in error, was to advance the &s;ubaltern officers, who&s;e merit had hitherto been neglected. Regardle&s;s of &s;eniority, wherever he found abilities, he was &s;ure to promote them; and thus he had all the upper ranks of commanders, rather re|markable for their &s;kill and talents, than for their age and experience.</P>
<P>In his fir&s;t campaign, the beginning of July, he repaired to the camp at Nimeguen, where he found him&s;elf at the head of an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, well provided with all nece&s;&s;aries, and long di&s;ciplined by the be&s;t officers of the age. He was oppo&s;ed on the &s;ide of France, by the duke of Burgundy, grand&s;on to the king, a youth more qualified to grace a court than to conduct an army; but the real acting general was the mar&s;hal Boufflers, who commanded under him, an of|ficer of courage and activity. But wherever Marlborough advanced, the French were ob|liged
<PB N="98" REF="100">
to retire before him, leaving all Spa|ni&s;h Guelderland at his di&s;cretion. The duke of Burgundy, finding him&s;elf obliged to retreat before the allied army, rather than ex|po&s;e him&s;elf longer to &s;uch a mortifying in|dignity, returned to Ver&s;ailles, leaving Bouf|flers to command alone. Boufflers, confound|ed at the rapidity of the enemies progre&s;s, re|tired towards Brabant, where Marlborough had no de&s;ign to pur&s;ue; contented with end|ing the campaign by the taking the city of Liege, in which was found an immen&s;e &s;um of money, and a great number of pri&s;oners. By the &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign, Marlborough rai&s;ed his military character, and confirmed him&s;elf in the confidence of the allies, natural|ly inclined to di&s;tru&s;t a foreign commander.</P>
<P>Marlborough, upon his return to London, was received with the mo&s;t flattering te&s;timo|nies of public approbation. He was thanked for his &s;ervices by the hou&s;e of commons, and was created a duke by the queen. His good fortune &s;eemed to con&s;ole the nation for &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions at &s;ea. Sir John Munden had permitted a French &s;quadron of fourteen &s;hips to e&s;cape him, by taking &s;helter in the harbour of Corunna, for which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervice by prince George. An
<PB N="99" REF="101">
attempt was al&s;o made upon Cadiz by &s;ea and land, Sir George Rooke commanding the navy, and the duke of Ormond the land forces, but this al&s;o mi&s;carried. But the Engli&s;h arms were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s at Vigo, where the duke of Ormond landed with five and twenty hundred men, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from the city; while the fleet forcing their way into the harbour, the French fleet that had taken refuge there were burned by the enemy, to pre|vent falling into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Eight &s;hips were thus burned and ran a-&s;hore; but ten &s;hips of war were taken, together with eleven galeons, and above a million of money in &s;ilver, which was of more benefit to the captors than the public. The advantage which was acquired by this expedition was coun|terbalanced by the ba&s;e conduct of &s;ome officers in the We&s;t-Indies. Admiral Ben|bow, a bold rough &s;eaman, had been &s;tationed in that part of the world with ten &s;hips, to di&s;tre&s;s the enemies trade. Being informed that Du Ca&s;&s;e, the French admiral, was in tho&s;e &s;eas with a force equal to his own, he re&s;olved to attack him; and &s;oon after di&s;covered the enemies &s;quadron near St. Martha, &s;teering along the &s;hore. He quickly gave orders to his captains, formed the line of battle, and the
<PB N="100" REF="102">
engagement began. He found, however, that the re&s;t of his fleet had taken &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t at his conduct, and that they permitted him, almo&s;t alone, to &s;u&s;tain the whole fire of the enemy. Neverthele&s;s the engagement continued till night, and he determined to renew it the next morning. But he had the mortification to per|ceive that all the re&s;t of his &s;hips had fallen back except one, who joined him in urging the pur&s;uit of the enemy. For four days did this intrepid &s;eaman, a&s;&s;i&s;ted only by one &s;hip, pur&s;ue and engage the enemy, while his cow|ardly officers, at a di&s;tance behind, remained &s;pectators of his activity. His la&s;t day's battle, was more furious than all the former: alone, and un&s;u&s;tained by the re&s;t, he engaged the whole French &s;quadron, when his leg was &s;hattered by a cannon-ball. He then ordered that they &s;hould place him in a cradle upon the quarter-deck; and there he continued to give orders as before, till, at la&s;t his &s;hip be|ing quite di&s;abled, was unfit to continue the chace any longer. When one of his lieute|nants expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of the admiral's leg,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry for it too, cried Benbow, but I had rather have lo&s;t both my legs, than &s;ee the di&s;honour of this day. But do you hear, if another &s;hot &s;hould take
<PB N="101" REF="103">
me off, behave like brave men, and fight it out."</Q>
He &s;oon after died of his wounds; and his cowardly a&s;&s;ociates, Kirby and Wade were tried by a court martial, and &s;entenced to be &s;hot. Hud&s;on died before his trial. Con|&s;table, Vincent, and Fogg, came off with &s;lighter puni&s;hment. Kirby and Wade were &s;ent home in the Bri&s;tol man of war; and on their arrival at Plymouth &s;hot on board the &s;hip, by virtue of a warrant for their imme|diate execution, which had lain there for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>The next parliament, which was convened by the queen, was highly plea&s;ed with the glare of &s;ucce&s;s which attended the Engli&s;h arms on the continent. The hou&s;e of com|mons was mo&s;tly made up of the Tory party, and con&s;equently much more liberal in their &s;upplies, than a Whig parliament would have been. They voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen, and the like number of land forces, to act in conjunction with tho&s;e of the allies. It was never con&s;idered how little nece&s;&s;ary the&s;e great efforts were, either to the happine&s;s, or pro|tection of the people; they were exerted again&s;t the French, and that was an an&s;wer to every demand. A &s;hort time after, the queen gave the hou&s;e of commons to under&s;tand, that the
<PB N="102" REF="104">
allies pre&s;&s;ed her to augment her forces. The commons were as ready to grant as &s;he to de|mand, and it was re&s;olved that ten thou&s;and men more &s;hould be added to the army on the con|tinent, but upon condition that the Dutch &s;hould break off all commerce with France and Spain. The Dutch complied without he&s;ita|tion; &s;en&s;ible that while England fought their battles, they might a little relax their in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>The duke of Marlborough cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in the beginning of April,<MILESTONE N="1706" UNIT="A.D."> and a&s;&s;embling the allied army, re&s;olved to &s;hew that his former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, only &s;purred him on to new tri|umphs. He opened the campaign with the &s;iege of Bonne, the re&s;idence of the elector of Cologne. This held out but a &s;hort time again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive attacks of the prince of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, the celebrated Coehorn, and ge|neral Fagel. He next retook Huy, the gar|ri&s;on of which, after a vigorous defence, &s;ur|rendered pri&s;oners of war. The &s;iege of Lim|burg was then undertaken, the place &s;urrender|ed in two days; and by the conque&s;t of this place, the allies &s;ecured the country of Liege, and the electorate of Cologne from the de|&s;igns of the enemy. Such was the campaign in the Netherlands, which, in all probability,
<PB N="103" REF="105">
would have produced events of greater impor|tance, had not the duke of Marlborough been re&s;trained by the Dutch, who began to be in|fluenced by the Love<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ein faction, ever aver&s;e to war with France.</P>
<P>The duke was re&s;olved in his next campaign to act more offen&s;ively; and, furni&s;hed with pro|per powers from the queen, he informed the Dutch that it was his intention to march to the relief of the empire, that had been for &s;ome time oppre&s;&s;ed by the French forces. The &s;tates general, either willing to &s;econd his efforts, or fearing to weaken the alliance by di&s;tru&s;t, gave him full power to march as he thought proper, with a&s;&s;urances of their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in all his endeavours. The French king now appointed the mar&s;hal Villeroy to head the army of oppo&s;ition; for Boufflers was no longer thought an equal to the enterpri&s;|ing duke.</P>
<P>Villeroy was &s;on to the king of France's governor, and had been educated with that monarch. He had been always the favourite of Lewis, and had long been a &s;harer in his amu&s;ements, his campaigns, and his glory. He was brave, generous, and polite, but unequal to the great ta&s;k of commanding an army; and &s;till more &s;o, when oppo&s;ed to &s;o great a
<PB N="104" REF="106">
rival. Marlborough, therefore, who was pe|culiarly famous for &s;tudying the di&s;po&s;ition and abilities of the general he was to oppo&s;e. having no very great fears from his pre&s;ent antagoni&s;t; in&s;tead of going forward to meet him, flew to the &s;uccour of the emperor, as had been already agreed at the commence|ment of the campaign. The Engli&s;h general, who was re&s;olved to &s;trike a vigorous blow for his relief, took with him about thirteen thou|&s;and Engli&s;h troops, traver&s;ed exten&s;ive coun|tries by ha&s;ty marches, arrived at the banks of the Danube, defeated a body of French and Bavarians, &s;tationed at Donavert to oppo&s;e him, then pa&s;&s;ed the Danube with his trium|phant army, and laid the dukedom of Bavaria, that had &s;ided with the enemy, under contri|bution. Villeroy, who at fir&s;t attempted to follow his motions, &s;eemed all at once to have lo&s;t &s;ight of his enemy; nor was he appri&s;|ed of his route, till informed of his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es. Mar&s;hal Tallard prepared by another route to ob&s;truct the duke of Marlborough's retreat, with an army of thirty thou&s;and men. He was &s;oon after joined by the duke of Ba|varia's forces, &s;o that the French army in that part of the continent amounted to &s;ixty thou|&s;and veterans, and commanded by the two be&s;t reputed generals then in France.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="107">Tallard had e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation by many former victories; he was active and pe|netrating, and had ri&s;en by his merits alone to the fir&s;t &s;tation in the army. But his ardour often ro&s;e to impetuo&s;ity; and he was &s;o &s;hort|&s;ighted as to be incapable of &s;eeing objects at a very &s;mall di&s;tance. The duke of Bavaria, was equally experienced in the field, and had &s;till &s;tronger motives for his activity. His coun|try was ravaged and pillaged before his eyes, and nothing remained of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but the army which he commanded. It was in vain that he &s;ent entreaties to the enemy to &s;top the fury of their incur&s;ions, and to &s;pare his people; the only an&s;wer he received was, that it lay in his own power to make his enemies friends, by alliance or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To oppo&s;e the&s;e powerful generals, the duke was now joined by a body of thirty thou&s;and men, un|der the conduct of the prince Eugene, who&s;e troops were well di&s;ciplined, but &s;till more formi|dable by the conduct and fame of their general. Prince Eugene had been bred up from his infancy in camps; he was almo&s;t equal to Marlborough in intrigue, and his &s;uperior in the art of war. Their talents were of a &s;imilar kind; and in&s;tead of any mean rival&s;hip or jealou&s;y between &s;uch eminent per&s;ons, they
<PB N="106" REF="108">
concurred in the &s;ame de&s;igns; for the &s;ame good &s;en&s;e determined them always to the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>This allied army, at the head of which Eu|gene and Marlborough commanded, amounted to about fifty-two thou&s;and men, troops that had long been accu&s;tomed to conquer, and that had &s;een the French, the Turks, and the Ru&s;|&s;ians fly before them. The French, as was al|ready ob&s;erved, amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and, who had &s;hared ini the conque&s;ts of their great monarch, and had been familiar with victory. Both armies, after many marchings and coun|termarchings, approached each other. The French were po&s;ted on an hill near the town of Hoch&s;tet; their right covered by the Danube, and the village of Blenheim; their left by the village of Lutzengen, and their front by a ri|vulet, the banks of which were &s;teep, and the bottom mar&s;hy. It was in this advantageous po&s;ition, that the allied army re&s;olved to at|tack them. As this engagment, which has &s;ince been known by the name of the battle of Blenheim, both from the talents of the generals, the improvements in the art of war, and the number and di&s;cipline of the troops, is reckon|ed the mo&s;t remarkable of this century, it demands a more particular detail than I have alotted to &s;uch narrations.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="109">The right wing of the French, which was covered by the Danube, and the village of Blenheim, was commanded by mar&s;hal Tal|lard. Their left, defended by another village, was commanded by the duke of Bavaria, and under him general Mar&s;in, an experienced Frenchman. In the front of their army ran a rivulet, which &s;eemed to defend them from an attack; and in this po&s;ition they were will|ing to await the enemy, rather than offer bat|tle. On the other hand, Marlborough and Eugene were &s;timulated to engage them at any rate, by an intercepted letter from Villeroy, who was left behind, intimating that he was preparing to cut off all communication between the Rhine and the allied army. The di&s;po&s;i|tions being made for the attack, and the or|ders communicated to the general officers, the allied forces advanced into the plain, and were ranged in order of battle. The cannonading began about nine in the morning, and conti|nued to about half after twelve. Then the troops advanced to the attack; the right un|der the direction of prince Eugene, the left headed by Marlborough, and oppo&s;ed to mar|&s;hal Tallard.</P>
<P>Marlborough, at the head of his Engli&s;h troops, having pa&s;&s;ed the rivulet, attacked the
<PB N="108" REF="110">
cavalry of Tallard with great bravery. This general was at that time reviewing the di&s;po|&s;ition of his troops to the left; and his ca|valry fought for &s;ome time without the pre|&s;ence of their commander. Prince Eugene on the left had not yet attacked the forces of the elector; and it was near an hour before he could bring up his troops to the engagement.</P>
<P>Tallard was no &s;ooner informed that his right was attacked by the duke, but he flew to its head, where he found a furious en|counter already begun; his cavalry being thrice driven back, and rallying as often. He had po&s;ted a large body of forces in the village of Blenheim; and he made an attempt to bring them to the charge. They were attack|ed by a detachment of Marlborough's forces &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the main body, they could hardly maintain their ground. All the French cavalry being thus attacked in flank was totally defeated. The Engli&s;h army, thus half victorious, pierced up between the two bodies of the French com|manded by the mar&s;hal and elector, while at the &s;ame time the forces in the village of Blen|heim were &s;eparated by another detachment. In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, Tallard flew to rally &s;ome &s;quadrons; but from his &s;hort &s;ighted|ne&s;s
<PB N="109" REF="111">
mi&s;taking a detachment of the enemy for his own, he was taken pri&s;oner by the He&s;&s;ian troops, who were in Engli&s;h pay. In the mean time prince Eugene on his part, after having been thrice repul&s;ed, at la&s;t put the enemy into confu&s;ion. The rout then became general, and the flight precipitate. The con|&s;ternation was &s;uch, that the French &s;oldiers threw them&s;elves into the Danube, without knowing where they fled. The officers lo&s;t all their authority, and there was no general left to &s;ecure a retreat.</P>
<P>The allies now being ma&s;ters of the field of battle, &s;urrounded the village of Blenheim, where a body of thirteen thou&s;and men had been po&s;ted in the beginning of the action, and &s;till kept their ground. The&s;e troops &s;ee|ing them&s;elves cut off from all communica|tion with the re&s;t of the army, threw down their arms, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;on|ers of war. Thus ended the battle of Blen|heim, one of the mo&s;t complete victories that ever was obtained. Twelve thou&s;and French and Bavarians were &s;lain in the field, or drown|ed in the Danube, and thirteen thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners of war. Of the allies about five thou&s;and men were killed, and eight thou|&s;and wounded or taken. The lo&s;s of the bat|tle
<PB N="110" REF="112">
was imputed to two capital errors commit|ted by mar&s;hal Tallard; namely, his weak|ening the center by placing &s;o large a body of troops in the village of Blenheim, and his &s;uffering the Engli&s;h to cro&s;s the rivulet, and form on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>The next day, when the duke of Marlbo|rough vi&s;ited his pri&s;oner, the mar&s;hal, intend|ing a compliment, a&s;&s;ured him that he had overcome the be&s;t troops in the world.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I hope Sir, replied the duke, you will except tho&s;e troops by whom they were conquered."</Q>
A country of an hundred leagues extent fell by this defeat into the hands of the victor. Not contented with the&s;e conque&s;ts, the duke&punc; &s;oon after the fini&s;hing the campaign, repaired to Berlin, where he procured a reinforcement of eight thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians to &s;erve under prince Eugene in Italy. Thence he proceed|ed to negotiate for &s;uccours at the court of Hanover, and &s;oon after returned to England, where he found the people in a phrenzy of joy. He was received as the deliverer of the &s;tate, as one who had retrieved the glory of the nation. The parliament and the people were ready to &s;econd him in all his de&s;igns. The manor of Wood&s;tock was conferred upon him for his &s;ervices by both hou&s;es; an eulo|gium
<PB N="111" REF="113">
was pronounced upon his important &s;er|vices by the lord-keeper as he entered the hou&s;e of lords. The queen was not only plea&s;|ed with the&s;e marks of re&s;pect &s;hewn him, but al&s;o ordered the comptroller of her works to build in Wood&s;tock park a magnificent palace for the duke, which remains to this day a monument, as the be&s;t judges now begin to think, not le&s;s of his victories, than of the &s;kill of the architect who rai&s;ed it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the arms of England were not le&s;s fortunate by &s;ea, than they had been upon the Danube. The mini&s;try of England under&s;tanding that the French were employed in equipping a &s;trong &s;quadron in Bre&s;t, &s;ent out Sir Cloude&s;ly Shovel, and Sir George Rooke to watch their motions. Sir George, however, had farther orders to convoy a body of forces in tran&s;port-&s;hips to Barcelona, upon which a fruitle&s;s attack was made by the prince of He&s;&s;e. Finding no hopes, therefore, from this expedition, in two days after the troops were reimbarked, Sir George Rooke, joined by Sir Cloude&s;ly, called a council of war on board the fleet, as they lay off the coa&s;t of Africa. In this they re&s;olved to make an at|tempt upon Gibraltar, a city then belonging to the Spaniards, at that time ill provided with
<PB N="112" REF="114">
a garri&s;on, as neither expecting, nor fearing &s;uch an attempt.</P>
<P>The town of Gibraltar &s;tands upon a tongue of land, as the mariners call it, and defended by a rock inacce&s;&s;ible on every &s;ide but one. The prince of He&s;&s;e landed his troops, to the number of eighteen hundred, on the continent adjoining, and &s;ummoned the town to &s;urren|der, but without effect. Next day the admi|ral gave orders for cannonading the town; and perceiving that the enemy were driven from their fortifications at a place called the South Mole-head, ordered captain Whita|ker to arm all the boats, and a&s;&s;ault that quar|ter. Tho&s;e officers who happened to be near|e&s;t the mole, immediately manned their boats without orders, and entered the fortification &s;word in hand. But they were premature; for the Spaniards &s;prung a mine by which two lieutenants, and about an hundred men were killed and wounded. Neverthele&s;s, the two captains, Hicks and Jumper, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a platform, and kept their ground, until they were &s;u&s;tained by captain Whitaker, and the re&s;t of the &s;eamen, who took a redoubt between the mole and the town by &s;torm. Then the governor capitulated, and the prince of He&s;&s;e entered the place, amazed at the &s;uc|ce&s;s
<PB N="113" REF="115">
of the attempt, con&s;idering the &s;trength of the fortifications. When the news of this conque&s;t was brought to England, it was for &s;ome time in debate whether it was a capture worth thanking the admiral for. It was at la&s;t con&s;idered as unworthy public gratitude; and while the duke of Marlborough was extolled for u&s;ele&s;s &s;ervices, Sir George Rooke was left to neglect, and &s;oon di&s;placed from his com|mand, for having &s;o e&s;&s;entially &s;erved his coun|try. A &s;triking in&s;tance that, even in the mo&s;t enlightened age, popular applau&s;e is mo&s;t u&s;ually mi&s;placed. Gibraltar has ever &s;ince remained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, and continues of the utmo&s;t u&s;e in refitting that part of the navy de&s;tined to annoy an enemy, or protect our trade in the Mediterranean. Here the Engli&s;h have a repo&s;itory capable of containing all things nece&s;&s;ary for the repair|ing of fleets, or the equipment of armies.</P>
<P>Soon after the taking this important garri|&s;on, the Engli&s;h fleet, now become &s;overeign of the &s;eas, to the number of three and fifty &s;hips of the line, came up with a French fleet, to the number of fifty-two, commanded by the count de Thoulou&s;e, off the coa&s;t of Ma|laga. This was the la&s;t great naval engage|ment in which the French ventured to face the Engli&s;h upon equal terms; all their
<PB N="114" REF="116">
efforts &s;ince being calculated rather for e&s;cape than oppo&s;ition. A little after ten in the morning the battle began with equal fury on both &s;ides, and continued to rage with doubt|ful &s;ucce&s;s till two in the afternoon, when the van of the French gave way. For two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive days the Engli&s;h admiral endea|voured to renew the engagement, which the French fleet as cautiou&s;ly declined, and at la&s;t di&s;appeared totally. Both nations at|tempted to claim the honour of the victory upon this occa&s;ion; the con&s;equence has &s;ince decided it in favour of the Engli&s;h, as they &s;till kept the element of battle.</P>
<P>However the taking of Gibraltar was a conque&s;t of which the Spaniards knew the lo&s;s, though we &s;eemed ignorant of the value. Phi|lip, king of Spain, alarmed at the reduction of that fortre&s;s, &s;ent the marquis of Villadu|rias with a large army to retake it. France al&s;o &s;ent a fleet of thirteen &s;hips of the line; but a part of this was di&s;per&s;ed by a tempe&s;t, and part was taken by the Engli&s;h. Nor was the land army more &s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;iege continued for four months, during which time the prince of He&s;&s;e, who commanded the town for the Engli&s;h, exhibited many proofs of valour. At length, the Spaniards having
<PB N="115" REF="117">
attempted to &s;cale the rock in vain, finding no hopes of taking the place, were contented to draw off their men, and abandon the enter|prize.</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;h were thus victorious by land and &s;ea, a new &s;cene of contention was opened on the &s;ide of Spain, where the ambi|tion of the European princes exerted it&s;elf with the &s;ame fury that had filled the re&s;t of the continent. Philip, the fourth grand&s;on of Lewis the fourteenth, had been placed upon the throne of that kingdom, and had been re|ceived with the joyful concurrence of the greate&s;t part of his &s;ubjects. He had al&s;o been nominated &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown by the late king of Spain's will. But in a former treaty among the powers of Europe, Charles, &s;on of the emperor of Germany, was appointed heir to that crown; and this treaty had been gua|rantied by France her&s;elf, though &s;he now re|&s;olved to rever&s;e that con&s;ent in favour of a de&s;cendant of the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Charles was &s;till farther led on to put in for the crown of Spain by the invitation of the Catalonians, who declared in his favour, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Engli&s;h and Portugue&s;e, who promi&s;ed to arm in his cau&s;e. Upon his way to his newly a&s;&s;umed dominion he landed in
<PB N="116" REF="118">
England, where he was received on &s;hore by the dukes of Somer&s;et and Marlborough, who conducted him to Wind&s;or. The queen's de|portment to him was equally noble and ob|liging, while, on his &s;ide, he gave general &s;a|tisfaction, by the politene&s;s and affability of his conduct. He was furni&s;hed with two hun|dred tran&s;ports, thirty &s;hips of war, and nine thou&s;and men, for the conque&s;t of that exten|&s;ive empire. But the earl of Peterborough, a man of romantic bravery, offered to conduct them; and his &s;ingle &s;ervice was thought equi|valent to armies.</P>
<P>The earl of Peterborough was one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary men of the age in which he lived. When yet but fifteen he fought again&s;t the Moors in Africa; at twenty he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in compa&s;&s;ing the Revolu|tion, and he now carried on the war in Spain almo&s;t at his own expence; his friend&s;hip for the duke Charles being one of his chief mo|tives to this great undertaking. He was de|formed in his per&s;on; but of a mind the mo&s;t generous, honourable, and active. His fir&s;t attempt upon landing in Spain was to be&s;iege Barcelona, a &s;trong city, with a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and men, while his own army a|mounted to little more than nine thou&s;and. The
<PB N="117" REF="119">
operations were begun by a &s;udden attack on fort Monjuic, &s;trongly &s;ituated on an hill that commanded the city. The outworks were taken by &s;torm; and a &s;hell chancing to fall into the body of the fort, the powder maga|zine was blown up. This &s;truck the garri&s;on that defended the fort with &s;uch con&s;ternation, that they &s;urrendered without farther re&s;i&s;t|ance. The town &s;till remained unconquered; but batteries were erected again&s;t it, and after a few days the governor capitulated. During the interval, which was taken up in demand|ing and &s;igning the nece&s;&s;ary form upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, a body of Germans and Cataloni|ans, belonging to the Engli&s;h army, entered the town, and were plundering all before them. The governor, who was then treating with the Engli&s;h general, thought him&s;elf betrayed, and upbraided that nobleman's treachery. Pe|terborough, &s;truck with the &s;uddenne&s;s of the tran&s;action, left the writings unfini&s;hed, and flying among the plunderers drove them from their prey, and then returned calmly back, and &s;igned the capitulation. The Spaniards were equally amazed at the genero&s;ity of the Engli&s;h, and the ba&s;ene&s;s of their own coun|trymen, who had led on to the &s;poil. The conque&s;t of all Valencia &s;ucceeded the taking
<PB N="118" REF="120">
of this important place. The enemy endea|voured indeed to retake Barcelona; but were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s, and the affairs of Philip &s;eemed de&s;perate. The party that acknow|leged Charles was every day increa&s;ing. He became ma&s;ter of Arragon, Carthagena, and Granada. The way to Madrid, the capital of Spain, lay open to him. The earl of Gal|way entered that city in triumph, and there proclaimed Charles king of Spain, without any oppo&s;ition. Such was the beginning of the war, as conducted by the allies in Spain; but its end was more unfortunate and inde|ci&s;ive.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h paid very lit|tle regard to the&s;e victories; for their whole attention was taken up by the &s;plendour of their victories in Flanders; and the duke of Marlborough took care that they &s;hould &s;till have &s;omething to wonder at. He had early in the &s;pring opened the campaign, and brought an army of eighty thou&s;and men into the field, which was greater than what he had hitherto been able to mu&s;ter. But &s;till he ex|pected reinforcements from Denmark and Pru&s;&s;ia; and the court of France was re&s;olved to attack him before this junction. Villeroy, who commanded their army, con&s;i&s;ting of eighty
<PB N="119" REF="121">
thou&s;and men, near Tirelemont, had orders to act upon the defen&s;ive; but if compelled, to hazard an engagement. The duke on the other hand, had received a &s;light repul&s;e by the defection of prince Lewis Baden; and he re|&s;olved to retrieve his credit by &s;ome &s;ignal action. Villeroy had drawn up his forces in a &s;trong camp; his right was flanked by the river Mehaigne; his left was po&s;ted behind a mar&s;h, and the village of Ramilies lay in the center. Marlborough, who perceived this di&s;po&s;ition, drew up his army accordingly. He knew that the left wing of the enemy could not pa&s;s the mar&s;h to attack him, but at a great di&s;advantage; he therefore weakened his troops in that quarter, and thundered on the center with &s;uperior numbers. The enemies center was &s;oon obliged to yield in con&s;equence of this attack, and at length gave way on all &s;ides. The hor&s;e, abandoning their foot, were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, that almo&s;t all were cut to pieces. Six thou&s;and men were taken pri&s;o|ners, and about eight thou&s;and were killed and wounded. This victory was almo&s;t as &s;ignal as that of Blenheim; Bavaria and Co|logne were the fruits of the one, and all Bra|bant was gained by the other. The French troops were di&s;pirited; the city of Paris was
<PB N="120" REF="122">
in confu&s;ion. Lewis, who had long been flat|tered with conque&s;t, was now humbled to &s;uch a degree, as almo&s;t to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of his enemies. He entreated for peace, but in vain; the allies carried all before them, and his very capital began to dread the approach of the conquerors. What neither his power, his armies, nor his politics could effect, was brought about by a party in England. The di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the Whigs and Tories in England &s;aved France, that was now tottering on the brink of ruin.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. ANNE. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THE councils of the queen had hitherto been governed by a Whig mini&s;try; for tho' the duke of Marlborough had fir&s;t &s;tarted in the Tory intere&s;t, he &s;oon joined the oppo&s;ite faction, as he found them mo&s;t &s;incere in their de&s;ires to humble the power of France. The Whigs, therefore, &s;till pur&s;ued the &s;chemes of the late king; and, impre&s;&s;ed with a republican &s;pirit of liberty, &s;trove to humble de&s;poti&s;m in every part of Europe. In a government where the rea&s;oning of individuals, retired from power, generally leads tho&s;e who com|mand, the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try mu&s;t alter, as the people happen to change. The people, in fact, were beginning to change. The queen's per&s;onal virtues, her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, her deference for the clergy, and, in turn, their great veneration for her, began to have a pre|vailing influence over the whole nation. The people of every rank were not a&s;hamed to de|fend the mo&s;t &s;ervile tenets, when they tend|ded
<PB N="122" REF="124">
to flatter or encrea&s;e the power of the &s;o|vereign. They argued in favour of &s;trict he|reditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, divine right, and non-re|&s;i&s;tance to the regal power. The &s;pirit of Tory|i&s;m began to prevail; and the Whigs, who had rai&s;ed the queen into greatne&s;s, were the fir&s;t that were likely to fall by their own &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tories, though joining in vigorous mea&s;ures again&s;t France, were, however, never ardently their enemies; they rather &s;ecretly hated the Dutch, as of principles very oppo|&s;ite to their own; and only longed for an op|portunity of withdrawing from their friend&s;hip. They began to meditate &s;chemes of oppo&s;ition to the duke of Marlborough. They were taught to regard him as a &s;elf-intere&s;ted man, who &s;acrificed the real advantages of the na|tion, in protracting a ruinous war for his own private emolument and glory. They &s;aw their country oppre&s;&s;ed with an increa&s;ing load of taxes, which, by a continuance of the war, mu&s;t inevitably become an intolerable burthen. Their &s;ecret di&s;contents, therefore, began to &s;pread; and the Tories wanted only a few de|termined leaders to conduct them in removing the pre&s;ent mini&s;try.</P>
<P>In the mean time, a pau&s;e of victory, or ra|ther a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of lo&s;&s;es began to di&s;&s;ipate
<PB N="123" REF="125">
the conquering phrenzy, which had &s;eized the nation, and incline them to wi&s;h for peace. The army under Charles in Spain was then command|ed by the lord Galway. This nobleman having received intelligence that the enemy, under the command of the duke of Berwick, was po&s;ted near the town of Almanza, he advanced thi|ther to give him battle. The conflict began about two in the afternoon, and the whole front of each army was fully engaged. The center, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of battalions from Great Brit|tain and Holland, &s;eemed at fir&s;t victorious; but the Portugue&s;e hor&s;e, by whom they were &s;upported, betaking them&s;elves to flight on the fir&s;t charge, the Engli&s;h troops were flank|ed and &s;urrounded on every &s;ide. In this dread|ful emergency they formed them&s;elves into a &s;quare, and retired to an eminence, where, be|ing ignorant of the country, and de&s;titute of all &s;upplies, they were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of war, to the number of ten thou|&s;and men. This victory was complete and deci&s;ive; and all Spain, except the province of Catalonia, returned to their duty to Philip their native &s;overeign.</P>
<P>An attempt was made upon Toulon, by the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene by land, and the Engli&s;h fleet by &s;ea, but with as little
<PB N="124" REF="126">
&s;ucce&s;s as in the former in&s;tance. The prince, with a body of thirty thou&s;and men, took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the eminences that commanded the city, while the fleet attacked and reduced two forts at the entrance of the mole. But the French king &s;ending an army to the relief of the place, and the duke of Savoy perceiving no hopes of compelling the city to a &s;peedy &s;urrender, he re&s;olved to abandon his enter|prize; and having embarked his artillery, he retreated by night without any mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>The fleet under Sir Cloude&s;ly Shovel, was &s;till more unfortunate. Having &s;et &s;ail for England, and being in &s;oundings on the twen|ty-&s;econd day of October, about eight at night a violent &s;torm ari&s;ing, his &s;hip was da&s;hed up|on the rocks of Scilly, and every &s;oul on board peri&s;hed. The like fate befel three &s;hips more, while three or four others were &s;aved with the utmo&s;t difficulty. The admiral's body being ca&s;t a-&s;hore, was &s;tript and buried in the &s;and; but this was thought too humble a funeral for &s;o brave a commander, it was dug up again, and interred with proper &s;olemnity in We&s;t|min&s;ter-Abbey.</P>
<P>Nor were the allies more pro&s;perous on the Upper Rhine in Germany. Mar&s;hal Villars, the French general, carried all before him, and
<PB N="125" REF="127">
was upon the point of re&s;toring the elector of Bavaria. The only hopes of the people, lay in the activity and conduct of the duke of Marlborough, who opened the campaign at Underluch, near Bru&s;&s;els, about the middle of May. But even here they were di&s;appointed, as in all the re&s;t. That general, either really willing to protract the war, or receiving intelli|gence that the French army was &s;uperior in num|bers, declined an engagement; and rather en|deavoured to &s;ecure him&s;elf, than annoy the enemy. Thus, after &s;everal marchings and counter-marchings, which it would be tedious to relate, both armies retired into winter-quar|ters, at the latter end of October. The French made preparations for the next campaign with recruited vigour. The duke of Marlborough returned to England, to meet with a reception which he did not at all expect.</P>
<P>Previous to the di&s;grace of the Whig mini&s;try, who&s;e fall was now ha&s;tening, a mea|&s;ure of the greate&s;t importance took place in parliament; a mea&s;ure that had been wi&s;hed by many, but thought too difficult for execu|tion. What I mean, is the union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland; which, though they were governed by one &s;o|vereign &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of James the fir&s;t,
<PB N="126" REF="128">
yet were &s;till ruled by their re&s;pective parlia|ments, and often profe&s;&s;ed to pur&s;ue oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts and different de&s;igns. An union of both parliaments, was at one time pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired by James. King Charles, his &s;on, took &s;ome &s;teps to effect this mea&s;ure; but many apparently in&s;urmountable objections lay in the way. This great ta&s;k was re&s;erved for queen Anne to accompli&s;h, at a time when both nations were in good humour at their late &s;ucce&s;&s;es; and the queen's title and admi|ni&s;tration were admitted and approved by all.</P>
<P>The attempt for an union, was begun at the commencement of this reign; but &s;ome di&s;putes ari&s;ing relative to the trade to the Ea&s;t, the conference was broke up, and it was thought that an adju&s;tment would be impo&s;&s;ible. It was revived by an act in either parliament, granting power to commi&s;&s;ioners named on the part of both nations, to treat on the pre|liminary articles of an union, which &s;hould afterwards undergo a more thorough di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by the legi&s;lative body of both kingdoms. The choice of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners was left to the queen; and &s;he took care that none &s;hould be employed, but &s;uch as heartily wi&s;hed to promote &s;o de&s;irable a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">Accordingly, the queen having appointed commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides, they met in the council-chamber of the Cock-pit, near Whitehall, which was the place appointed for their conferences. Their commi&s;&s;ions being opened, and introductory &s;peeches being pro|nounced by the lord keeper of England, and the lord chancellor of Scotland, the conference began. The Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners were in|clined to a foederal union, like that of the United Provinces; but the Engli&s;h were bent upon an incorporation, &s;o that no Scotti&s;h par|liament &s;hould ever have power to repeal the articles of the treaty. The lord keeper Cow|per, propo&s;ed that the two kingdoms of Eng|land and Scotland, &s;hould be for ever united into one, by the name of Great Britain; that it &s;hould be repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame parliament, and governed by the &s;ame here|ditary monarch. The Scotch commi&s;&s;ioners on their &s;ide, in&s;i&s;ted that the &s;ubjects of Scot|land, &s;hould for ever enjoy the &s;ame rights and privileges with tho&s;e of England; and that all &s;tatutes, contrary to the tenor of the&s;e pri|vileges in either kingdom, &s;hould be repealed. As the queen frequently exhorted the com|mi&s;&s;ioners to di&s;patch, the articles of this fa|mous union were &s;oon agreed to, and &s;igned
<PB N="128" REF="130">
by the commi&s;&s;ioners; and it only remained to lay them before the parliaments of both na|tions.</P>
<P>In this famous treaty it was &s;tipulated, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the united kingdoms &s;hould be ve&s;ted in the hou&s;e of Hanover; that the united kingdoms &s;hould be repre&s;ented by one and the &s;ame parliament; that all the &s;ubjects of Great Britain &s;hould enjoy a communication of privileges and advantages; that they &s;hould have the &s;ame allowances and privileges with re&s;pect to commerce and cu&s;toms; that the laws concerning public right, civil govern|ment and policy, &s;hould be the &s;ame through|out the two united kingdoms; but that no al|teration &s;hould be made in laws which concern|ed private right, except for the evident bene|fit of the &s;ubjects of Scotland; that the courts of Se&s;&s;ion, and all other courts of judicature in Scotland, &s;hould remain, as then con&s;tituted by the laws of that kingdom, with the &s;ame authority and privileges as before the union; that Scotland &s;hould be repre&s;ented in the par|liament of Great Britain, by &s;ixteen peers, and forty-five commoners, to be elected in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hould be &s;ettled by the pre&s;ent parliament of Scotland; that all peers of Scot|land &s;hould be con&s;idered as peers of Great
<PB N="129" REF="131">
Britain, and rank immediately after the Eng|li&s;h peers of the like degrees at the time of the union, and before &s;uch as &s;hould be created after it; that they &s;hould enjoy all the privi|leges of Engli&s;h peers, except that of &s;itting and voting in parliament, or &s;itting upon the trial of peers; that all the in&s;ignia of royalty and government &s;hould remain as they were; that all laws and &s;tatutes in either kingdom, &s;o far as they might be incon&s;i&s;tent with the terms of the&s;e articles, &s;hould cea&s;e, and be declared void by the re&s;pective parliaments of the two kingdoms. The&s;e were the principal articles of the union; and it only remained to obtain the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature of both kingdoms to give them authority; but this was a much more difficult undertaking than it was fir&s;t imagined to be. It was not only to be approved by the parliament of Scotland, all the popular members of which were aver&s;e to the union, but it was al&s;o to pa&s;s through both hou&s;es in England, where it was not a little di&s;agreeable, except to the mini&s;try, who had propo&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The arguments in the&s;e different a&s;&s;emblies were &s;uited to the audience. To induce the Scotch parliament to come into the mea&s;ure, it was alledged by the mini&s;try, and their &s;up|porters,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
that an entire and perfect union would be the &s;olid foundation of a la&s;ting peace. It would &s;ecure their religion, liberty and proper|ty, remove the animo&s;ities that prevailed a|mong them&s;elves, and the jealou&s;ies that &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between the two nations. It would en|crea&s;e their &s;trength, riches, and commerce, the whole i&s;land would be joined in affection, and freed from all apprehen&s;ions of different inte|re&s;ts. It would be enabled to re&s;i&s;t all its ene|mies, &s;upport the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and main|tain the liberties of Europe. It was ob&s;erved, that the le&s;s the wheels of government were clogged by a multiplicity of councils, the more vigorous would be their exertions. They were &s;hewn that the taxes which, in con&s;equence of this union, they were to pay, were by no means &s;o great proportionably, as their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature. That their taxes did not a|mount to a &s;eventieth part of tho&s;e &s;upplied by the Engli&s;h; and yet their &s;hare in the le|gi&s;lature was not a tenth part le&s;s. Such were the arguments in favour of the union, addre&s;|&s;ed to the Scotch parliament. In the Engli&s;h hou&s;es it was ob&s;erved, that a powerful and dangerous nation would thus for ever be pre|vented from giving them any di&s;turbance. That in ca&s;e of any future rupture, England
<PB N="131" REF="133">
had every thing to lo&s;e, and nothing to gain, again&s;t a nation that was courageous and poor.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the Scotch were fired with indignation at the thoughts of lo&s;ing their ancient and independent government. The nobility found them&s;elves degraded in point of dignity and influence, by being excluded from their &s;eats in parliament. The trading part of the nation beheld their commerce loaded with heavy duties, and con&s;idered their new privilege of trading to the Engli&s;h plantations in the We&s;t Indies, as a very uncertain advan|tage. In the Engli&s;h hou&s;es al&s;o it was ob&s;erved, that the union of a rich with a poor nation would be always beneficial to the latter, and that the former could only hope for a partici|pation of their nece&s;&s;ities. It was &s;aid that the Scotch reluctantly yielded to this coali|tion, and that it might be likened to a mar|riage with a woman again&s;t her con&s;ent. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an union made up of &s;o many unmatched pieces, and &s;uch incongruous in|gredients, that it could never take affect. It was complained, that the proportion of the land-tax paid by the Scotch, was &s;mall and unequal to their &s;hare in the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="134">To the&s;e arguments in both nations, be&s;ide the &s;hew of a particular an&s;wer to each, one great argument was u&s;ed, which preponderat|ed again&s;t all the le&s;&s;er ones. It was ob&s;erv|ed, that all inconveniences were to be over|looked in the attainment of one great &s;olid ad|vantage; that of acting with an uniformity of councils for the benefit of a community natu|rally united. The party, therefore, for the union prevailed; and this mea&s;ure was carried in both nations, through all the ob&s;tacles of pretending patrioti&s;m and private intere&s;t; from which we may learn, that many great difficulties are &s;urmounted, becau&s;e they are not &s;een by tho&s;e who direct the operation; and that &s;chemes, which theory deems imprac|ticable, will often &s;ucceed in experiment.</P>
<P>Thus, notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition made by the Tories, every article of the union was approved by a great majority in the hou&s;e of lords, which, being &s;ent to be ratified by the hou&s;e of commons, Sir Simon Harcourt, the &s;ollicitor, prepared the bill in &s;uch an artful manner as to prevent all debates. All the articles as they pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland were re|cited by way of preamble; and in the conclu|&s;ion there was one clau&s;e, by which the whole was ratified, and enacted into a law. By this
<PB N="133" REF="135">
contrivance, tho&s;e who were de&s;irous of &s;tart|ing new difficulties found them&s;elves di&s;abled from pur&s;uing their aim; they could not ob|ject to the recital, which was barely a matter of fact; and they had not &s;trength &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e all the articles at once, which had be|fore pa&s;&s;ed with the approbation of the majo|rity. It pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of commons by a majority of one hundred and fourteen; it made its way through the hou&s;e of lords a &s;e|cond time with equal ea&s;e, and when it receiv|ed the royal &s;anction, the queen expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLI. ANNE. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>IT is a little extraordinary that, through all the tran&s;actions relative to the union, the Tories vio|lently oppo&s;ed it; for they con&s;idered the Scotch, in a body, as Whigs, and &s;uppo&s;ed that their in|tere&s;t would become more powerful by this a&s;&s;o|ciation. But never were men more agreeably di&s;appointed than the Tories were in this par|ticular. The majority of the Scotch nation, which was entirely again&s;t uniting with Eng|land, were &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfied with this mea|&s;ure, that they immediately joined in oppo&s;|ing the mini&s;try, by whom they were thus compelled to unite. The members them|&s;elves were di&s;affected to the mea&s;ure, and &s;e|cretly &s;trove to undermine tho&s;e by whom their power had been thus e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The body of Engli&s;h Tories were not le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed with an union, of which they had not &s;agacity to di&s;tingui&s;h the advantages. They were for &s;ome time become the majority in the kingdom, but found them&s;elves oppo&s;ed by a powerful coalition at court. The dutche&s;s
<PB N="135" REF="137">
of Marlborough, had long been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the queen's confidence and favour; and turn|ed the ea&s;ine&s;s of her mi&s;tre&s;s's temper to her own advantage, as well as that of her party. The duke of Marlborough, her hu&s;band, was at the head of the army that was devoted to him. Lord Godolphin, his &s;on-in-law, was at the head of the trea&s;ury, which he managed &s;o as entirely to co-operate with the ambition of the duke. But an unexpected alteration in the queen's affections was going to take place, which was entirely owing to their own mi&s;ma|nagement. Among the number of tho&s;e whom the dutche&s;s had introduced to the queen, to contribute to her private amu&s;ement, was one Mrs. Ma&s;ham, her own kin&s;woman, whom &s;he had rai&s;ed from indigence and ob&s;curity. The dutche&s;s having gained the a&s;cendant over the queen, became petulant, and in&s;olent, and relaxed in tho&s;e arts by which &s;he had ri&s;en. Mrs. Ma&s;ham, who had her fortune to make, was more humble and a&s;&s;iduous; &s;he flattered the foibles of the queen, and a&s;&s;ented to her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and prejudices. She &s;oon &s;aw the queen's inclination to the Tory &s;et of opinions, their divine right and pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience; and in&s;tead of attempting to thwart her as the dutche&s;s had done, &s;he joined in
<PB N="136" REF="138">
with her partiality, and even outwent her in her own way.</P>
<P>She began to in&s;inuate to the queen, that the Tories were by far the majority of the people. That they were di&s;plea&s;ed with a mini&s;try that attempted to rule their &s;overeign, and had lavi&s;hed the trea&s;ures of the nation on wars, which they cho&s;e to carry on in order to continue in power. But though this in|triguing woman &s;eemed to act from her&s;elf alone, &s;he was in fact the tool of Mr. Harley, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who al&s;o &s;ome time before had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the queen's good graces; and who determined to &s;ap the credit of Godolphin and Marlborough. His aim was to unite the Tory intere&s;t under his own &s;helter, and to expel the Whigs from the ad|vantages which they had long enjoyed under government. Harley, better known afterwards by the title of lord Oxford, was a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon erudition, great knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s, and as great ambition. He was clo&s;e, phlegmatic, and cool; but at the &s;ame time fonder of the &s;plendors of office than the drudgeries of it.</P>
<P>In his career of ambition, he cho&s;e for his coadjutor Henry St. John, afterwards the fa|mous lord Bolingbroke, a man of great elo|quence
<PB N="137" REF="139">
and greater ambition, enterpri&s;ing, re&s;t|le&s;s, active, and haughty, with &s;ome wit and little principle. This &s;tate&s;man was at fir&s;t contented to act in an inferior capacity, &s;ub|&s;ervient to Oxford's de&s;igns. It was not till afterwards, when he under&s;tood the full extent of his own parts and influence, that he was fired with the ambition of being fir&s;t in the &s;tate, and a&s;pired to depre&s;s his fir&s;t promoter.</P>
<P>To this junto was added Sir Simon Harcourt, a lawyer, a man of great abilities. The&s;e unit|ing, exerted their endeavours to rally and re|concile the &s;cattered body of the Tories; and diffu&s;ed a&s;&s;urances among their partizans, that the queen would no longer bear the tyranny of a Whig mini&s;try. She had ever been, they &s;aid, a friend in her heart to the Tory and high-church party, by which appellation this faction now cho&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; and to con|vince them of the truth of their a&s;&s;ertions, the queen her&s;elf &s;hortly after be&s;towed two bi|&s;hopricks on clergymen, who had openly con|demned the Revolution.</P>
<P>It was now perceived that the people them|&s;elves began to be weary of the Whig mi|ni&s;try, whom they formerly care&s;&s;ed. To them they imputed the burthens under which they groaned, burthens which they had been hi|therto
<PB N="138" REF="140">
animated to bear by the pomp of tri|umph; but the load of which they felt in a pau&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s. No new advantage had of late been &s;hewn them from the Netherlands. France, in&s;tead of &s;inking under the weight of the confederacy, as they had been taught to expect, &s;eemed to ri&s;e with fre&s;h vigour from every overthrow. The Engli&s;h merchants had late|ly &s;u&s;tained repeated lo&s;&s;es, for want of proper convoys; the coin of the nation was vi&s;ibly dimini&s;hed, and the public credit began to de|cline.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try were for a long time ignorant of the&s;e &s;ecret murmurings, or, &s;ecure in their own &s;trength, pretended to de&s;pi&s;e them. In|&s;tead, therefore, of attempting to mitigate the cen&s;ures propagated again&s;t them, or to &s;often the virulence of the faction, they continued to teize the queen with remon&s;trances again&s;t her conduct; and upbraided her with ingratitude for tho&s;e &s;ervices which had &s;ecured her glory. The murmurs of the nation, fir&s;t found vent in the hou&s;e of lords, where the earl of Whar|ton, &s;econded by lord Somers, expatiated up|on the &s;carcity of money, the decay of trade, and the mi&s;management of the navy. This complaint was backed by a petition from the &s;heriffs and merchants of the city, aggravating
<PB N="139" REF="141">
their lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea for want of convoys, and the&s;e complaints were proved by witne&s;&s;es. It began now to be urged, that attacking France in the Netherlands, was taking the bull by the horns; attempting the enemy where it was be&s;t prepared for a defence. Ox|ford was at the bottom of all the&s;e complaints; and though they did not produce an imme|diate effect, yet they did not fail of a growing and &s;teady operation.</P>
<P>At length the Whig part of the mini&s;try opened their eyes to the intrigues of their pre|tending coadjutor. The dutche&s;s of Marlbo|rough perceived, when it was too late, that &s;he was &s;upplanted by her in&s;idious rival; and her hu&s;band found no other means of re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ing his credit, but by openly oppo&s;ing Oxford, whom he could not otherwi&s;e di&s;place. The &s;ecretary had lately incurred &s;ome &s;u&s;picions, from the &s;ecret corre&s;pondence which one Gregg, an under-clerk in his office, kept up with the court of France. Gregg was executed, and the duke of Marlborough was willing to take advantage of this opportunity to remove Oxford. He accordingly wrote to the queen, that he and lord Godolphin could &s;erve her no longer, &s;hould the pre&s;ent &s;ecretary be con|tinued in his place. The queen, no way re|garding
<PB N="140" REF="142">
the &s;ecret intrigues of her mini&s;ters, was willing to keep them all in friend&s;hip, and endeavoured to appea&s;e the duke's re&s;ent|ment by every art of per&s;ua&s;ion. But he was too confident of his own power, and con|tinued ob&s;tinate in his refu&s;al. The earl of Godolphin and the duke went &s;o far as to re|tire from court, and the queen &s;aw her&s;elf in danger of being de&s;erted by her whole mini&s;|try. A &s;ullen &s;ilence prevailed through the cabinet-council; and &s;ome were even heard to &s;ay, that no deliberations could be pur&s;ued in the ab&s;ence of the duke and the lord trea|&s;urer.</P>
<P>The queen now, for the fir&s;t time, perceived the power which the&s;e two mini&s;ters had a&s;|&s;umed over her councils. She found that they were willing to place and di&s;place the &s;ervants of the crown at plea&s;ure; and that nothing was left to her, but to approve &s;uch mea&s;ures as they thought fit to pre&s;s upon her choice. She &s;ecretly, therefore, re&s;olved to remove a mini&s;try that was thus grown odious to her, but in the pre&s;ent exigence was obliged to give way to their demands. Next day, there|fore, &s;he &s;ent for the duke of Marlborough, and told him that Harley &s;hould immediately re&s;ign his office; and it was accordingly con|ferred
<PB N="141" REF="143">
on Mr. Henry Boyle, chancellor of the exchequer.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t efforts of the Tory party being thus fru&s;trated, Bolingbroke was re&s;olved to &s;hare in his friend Harley's di&s;grace, as al&s;o Sir Simon Harcourt, attorney-general, and Sir Thomas Man&s;ell, comptroller of the hou&s;hold, who all voluntarily relinqui&s;hed their employments. Bolingbroke's employment of &s;ecretary at war was conferred upon Robert Walpole, a man who how began to be con&s;iderable in the hou&s;e of commons, and who afterwards made &s;uch a figure in the two &s;ucceeding reigns.</P>
<P>The duke &s;eemed to triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of his re&s;entment, not con&s;idering that by this &s;tep he entirely lo&s;t the confidence of the queen. He returned to pro&s;ecute his victo|ries on the continent, where a new harve&s;t of glory attended him, which, however, did not re-e&s;tabli&s;h his power.</P>
<P>This violent mea&s;ure, which &s;eemed at fir&s;t favourable to the Whig mini&s;try, laid the foundation of its ruin. Harley was now en|abled to throw off the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, and to take more vigorous mea&s;ures for the pro&s;e|cution of his de&s;igns. In him the queen re|po&s;ed all her tru&s;t, though he now had no vi|&s;ible concern in the admini&s;tration. The fir&s;t triumph of the Tories, in which the queen
<PB N="142" REF="144">
di&s;covered a public partiality in their favour, was &s;een in a tran&s;action of no great im|portance in it&s;elf, but from the con&s;equences it produced. The parties of the nation were eager to engage, and they wanted but the watch-word to begin. This was given by a man neither of abilities, property, or power; but accidentally brought forward on this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Henry Sacheverel was a clergyman bred at Oxford, of narrow intellects, and an overheated imagination. He had acquired &s;ome popula|rity among tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the name of high-church men, and had taken all occa&s;ions to vent his animo&s;ity again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. At the &s;ummer a&s;&s;izes at Derby he had held forth in that &s;train before the judges. On the fifth of November, in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declamation, defended the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance, in|veighed again&s;t the toleration of di&s;&s;enters, de|clared the church was dangerou&s;ly attacked by its enemies, and &s;lightly defended by its fal&s;e friends. He &s;ounded the trumpet for the zealous, and exhorted the people to put on the whole armour of God. Sir Samuel Ger|rard, lord-mayor, countenanced this harangue, which, though very weak both in the matter
<PB N="143" REF="145">
and &s;tyle, was publi&s;hed under his protection, and extolled by the Tories as a ma&s;ter-piece of writing. The&s;e &s;ermons owed all their ce|lebrity to the complexion of the times, and they are now de&s;ervedly neglected.</P>
<P>Mr. Dolben, &s;on to the archbi&s;hop of York, laid a complaint before the hou&s;e of commons again&s;t the&s;e rhap&s;odies, and thus gave force to what would have &s;oon been forgotten. The mo&s;t violent paragraphs were read, and the &s;ermons voted &s;candalous and &s;editious libels. Sacheverel was brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, and he, far from di&s;owning the writing of them, gloried in what he had done, and men|tioned the encouragement he had received to publi&s;h them from the lord-mayor, who was then pre&s;ent. Being ordered to withdraw, it was re&s;olved to impeach him of high crimes and mi&s;demeanors at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords; and Mr. Dolben was fixed upon to con|duct the pro&s;ecution, in the name of the com|mons of all England. A committee was ap|pointed to draw up articles of impeachment; Sacheverel was taken into cu&s;tody, and a day was appointed for his trial before the lords in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Tories, who one and all ap|proved his principles, were as violent in his
<PB N="144" REF="146">
defence, as the commons had been in his pro|&s;ecution. They boldly affirmed that the Whigs had formed a de&s;ign to pull down the church, and that this pro&s;ecution was intended to try their &s;trength, before they would pro|ceed openly to the execution of their project. The clergy did not fail to alarm and enflame their hearers; while emi&s;&s;aries were employed to rai&s;e a ferment among the populace, already prepared for di&s;content, ari&s;ing from a &s;carcity, of provi&s;ions which at that time prevailed in al|mo&s;t every country of Europe. The dangers were magnified to which the church was ex|po&s;ed from di&s;&s;enters, Whigs, and luke-warm prelates. The&s;e they repre&s;ented as the au|thors of a ruinous war, that brought on that very dearth which they were then deploring. Such an exten&s;ive party, therefore, declaring in favour of Sacheverel, after the articles were exhibited again&s;t him, the lords thought fit to admit him to bail.</P>
<P>The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon this very extraordinary trial, which la&s;ted three weeks, and excluded all other public bu&s;ine&s;s for the time. The queen her&s;elf was every day pre&s;ent as a private &s;pectator, while va&s;t multitudes attended the culprit each day as he went to the hall, &s;houting as he pa&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="145" REF="147">
or &s;ilently praying for his &s;ucce&s;s. The ma|nagers for the commons were Sir Jo&s;eph Je|kyl, Mr. Eyre, &s;ollicitor-general, Sir Peter King, recorder, general Stanhope, Sir Thomas Parker, and Mr. Walpole. The doctor was defended by Sir Simon Harcourt, and Mr. Phipps, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by doctor Atterbury, doctor Smallridge, and doctor Freind. While the trial continued, nothing could exceed the violence and outrage of the populace. They &s;urrounded the queen's &s;edan, exclaiming,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God ble&s;s your maje&s;ty and the church; we hope your maje&s;ty is for doctor Sache|verel."</Q>
They de&s;troyed &s;everal meeting hou&s;es, plundered the dwellings of many emi|nent di&s;&s;enters, and even propo&s;ed to attack the bank. The queen, in compliance with the reque&s;t of the commons, publi&s;hed a pro|clamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the tumults; and &s;e|veral per&s;ons being apprehended were tried for high-trea&s;on. Two were convicted, and &s;en|tenced to die; but neither &s;uffered.</P>
<P>When the commons had gone through their charge, the managers for Sacheverel under|took his defence with great art and eloquence. He afterwards recited a &s;peech him&s;elf, which, from the difference found between it and his &s;ermons, &s;eems evidently the work of another.
<PB N="146" REF="148">
In this he &s;olemnly ju&s;tified his intentions to|wards the queen and her government. He &s;poke in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms of the Re|volution, and the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He maintained the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance as a tenet of the church, in which he was brought up; and in a pathetic conclu&s;ion endeavoured to excite the pity of his audience. He was &s;urrounded by the queen's chaplains, who en|couraged and extolled him as the champion of the church; and he was favoured by the queen her&s;elf, who could not but approve a doctrine that confirmed her authority, and enlarged her power.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are removed from the intere&s;ts of that period may be apt to regard with wonder &s;o great a conte&s;t from &s;o &s;light a cau&s;e; but, in fact, the &s;pirit of contention was before laid in the nation, and this per&s;on only happened to &s;et fire to the train. The lords, when they retired to con&s;ult upon his &s;entence, were divided, and continued unde|termined for &s;ome time. At length, after much ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, and virulent alterca|tion, Sacheverel was found guilty by a majo|rity of &s;eventeen voices; but no le&s;s than four and thirty peers entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this deci&s;ion. He was prohibited from preaching
<PB N="147" REF="149">
for three years; and his two &s;ermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the com|mon hangman, in pre&s;ence of the lord-mayor and the two &s;heriffs.</P>
<P>The lenity of this &s;entence, which was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the dread of popular re&s;entment, was con&s;idered by the Tories as a triumph. They declared their joy in bon|fires and illuminations, and openly avowed their rage again&s;t his per&s;ecutors. Soon af|ter he was pre&s;ented to a benefice in North Wales, where he went with all the pomp and magnificence of a &s;overeign prince. He was &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained by the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and many noblemen in his way, who, while they wor&s;hipped him as the idol of their faction, could not help de&s;pi&s;ing the ob|ject of their adoration. He was received in &s;everal towns by the magi&s;trates in their for|malities, and often attended by a body of a thou&s;and hor&s;e. At Bridgenorth he was met by one Mr. Cre&s;well, at the head of four thou|&s;and men on hor&s;eback, and as many on foot, wearing white knots, edged with gold. The hedges were for two miles dre&s;&s;ed with gar|lands, and the &s;teeples covered with &s;tream|ers, flags, and colours. The church, and doctor Sacheverel, was the univer&s;al cry, and
<PB N="148" REF="150">
a &s;pirit of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;pread through the whole nation.</P>
<P>Such was the complexion of the times, when the queen thought proper to &s;ummon a new parliament; and being a friend to the Tories her&s;elf, &s;he gave the people an opportunity of in|dulging them&s;elves in chu&s;ing repre&s;entatives to their mind. In fact, very few were re|turned, but &s;uch as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves by their zeal again&s;t the Whig admini|&s;tration. The Whigs were no longer able to keep their ground again&s;t the voice of the peo|ple, and the power of the queen. Tho' they had entrenched them&s;elves behind a very for|midable body in the hou&s;e of lords, and tho' by their wealth and family connexions they had in a manner fixed them&s;elves in office, yet they were now upon the edge of di&s;&s;olution, and required but a breeze to blow them from their height, where they imagined them&s;elves &s;o &s;ecure.</P>
<P>The duke had &s;ome time before gone back to Flanders, where he led on the united armies to great, though dear bought, victories. The French were di&s;pirited indeed, and rather kept upon the defen&s;ive; but &s;till, when forced to engage, they fought with great ob&s;tinacy, and &s;eemed to gather courage, as the frontiers of their own country became more nearly threatened.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151">Peace had more than once been offered, and treaties had been entered upon, and fru&s;trated. After the battle of Ramilies, the king of France had employed the elector of Bavaria to write letters in his name to the duke of Marlbo|rough, containing propo&s;als for opening a congre&s;s. He offered to give up either Spain and its dominions, or the kingdoms of Na|ples and Sicily to Charles of Au&s;tria, and to give a barrier to the Dutch in the Netherlands. But the&s;e terms were rejected. The Dutch were intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s; and the duke of Marlborough had every motive to conti|nue the war, as it gratified not only his ambi|tion, but his avarice; a pa&s;&s;ion that ob&s;cured his &s;hining abilities.</P>
<P>The duke, in fact, was re&s;olved to pu&s;h his good fortune. At the head of a numerous army he came up to the village of Oudenarde, where the French, in equal numbers, were po&s;ted. A furious engagement en&s;ued, in which the French were obliged to retire, and took the advantage of the night to &s;ecure their retreat. About three thou&s;and were &s;lain on the field of battle, &s;even thou&s;and were taken pri&s;oners, and the number of their de&s;erters was not a few. In con&s;equence of this vic|tory, Li&s;le, the &s;tronge&s;t town in all Flanders,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
was taken, after an ob&s;tinate &s;iege. Ghent followed &s;oon after; while Bruges, and the other le&s;&s;er towns in French Flanders, were aban|doned by their defenders. Thus this cam|paign ended with fixing a barrier to the Dutch dominions, and it now only remained to force a way into the provinces of the enemy.</P>
<P>The repeated &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the allies once more induced the French king to offer terms of peace. In the&s;e he was re&s;olved to &s;acri|fice all con&s;iderations of pride and ambition, as well as the intere&s;ts of his grand&s;on of Spain, to a mea&s;ure become &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;ible. A conference en&s;ued, in which the allies ro&s;e in their demands, without, how|ever, &s;tipulating any thing in favour of the Engli&s;h. The demands were rejected by France, and that exhau&s;ted kingdom once more prepared for another campaign.</P>
<P>Tournay, one of the &s;tronge&s;t cities in French Flanders, was the fir&s;t object of the opera|tions of the allied army, which now a|mounted to one hundred and ten thou&s;and fighting men. Though the garri&s;on of this city did not exceed twelve thou&s;and men, yet the place was &s;o &s;trong both by art and na|ture, that the &s;iege promi&s;ed to hold out much longer than was expected. Nothing could be
<PB N="151" REF="153">
more terrible than the manner of engaging during this &s;iege. As the be&s;iegers proceeded by &s;apping, their troops that were conducting the mines frequently met with tho&s;e of the enemy under ground, and furiou&s;ly engaged in &s;ubterraneous conflicts. The volunteers pre|&s;ented them&s;elves on both &s;ides in the mid&s;t of mines and countermines, ready primed for explo&s;ion, and added new horrors to their gloomy &s;ituation. Sometimes they were killed by accident, &s;ometimes &s;prung up by de&s;ign; while thou&s;ands of tho&s;e bold men were thus buried at once by the falling in of the earth, or blown up into the air from below. At length, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, the town was &s;urrendered upon conditions, and the garri&s;on of the citadel &s;oon after were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The bloody battle of Malplaquet followed &s;oon after. The French army, under the conduct of the great mar&s;hal Villars, amounting to an hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, were po&s;ted behind the woods of La Merte and Taniers, in the neighbourhood of Malplaquet. They had fortified their &s;ituation in &s;uch a manner with lines, hedges, and trees laid acro&s;s, that they &s;eemed to be quite inacce&s;&s;ible What were the duke's motives for attacking them at
<PB N="152" REF="154">
&s;uch a di&s;advantage to him&s;elf are not well known; but certainly this was the ra&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t ill-judged attempt during all his campaigns. On the eleventh day of September, early in the morning, the allied army, favoured by a thick fog, began the attack. The chief fury of their impre&s;&s;ion was made upon the left of the enemy, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that, notwith|&s;tanding their lines and barricadoes, the French were in le&s;s than an hour driven from their in|trenchments. But on the enemies right the combat was &s;u&s;tained with much greater ob|&s;tinacy. The Dutch, who carried on the at|tack, drove them from their fir&s;t line; but were repul&s;ed from the &s;econd with great &s;laughter. The prince of Orange, who headed that attack, per&s;i&s;ted in his efforts with incre|dible per&s;everance and intrepidity, though two hor&s;es had been killed under him, and the greater part of his officers &s;lain and di&s;abled. At la&s;t, however, the French were obliged to yield up the field of battle; but not till after having &s;old a dear victory. Villars being dangerou&s;ly wounded, they made an excellent retreat under the conduct of Boufflers, and took po&s;t near Gue&s;noy and Valenciennes. The conquerors took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field of battle, on which above twenty thou&s;and of their
<PB N="153" REF="155">
be&s;t troops lay &s;lain. The mar&s;hal Villars con|fidently a&s;&s;erted, that if he had not been di&s;a|bled, he would have gained a certain victory; and it is probable from that general's former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, that what he &s;aid was true. The city of Mons was the reward of this victory, which &s;urrendered &s;hortly after to the allied army, and with the taking of this the allies con|cluded the campaign.</P>
<P>Though the events of this campaign were more favourable to Lewis than he had rea&s;on to expect, yet he &s;till continued de&s;irous of peace, and once more re&s;olved to &s;ollicit a conference. He employed one Petkum, re|&s;ident of the duke of Hol&s;tein at the Hague, to negotiate upon this &s;ubject, and he ventured al&s;o to &s;ollicit the duke him&s;elf in private. However, as his affairs now were le&s;s de&s;perate than in the beginning of the campaign, he would not &s;tand to tho&s;e conditions, which he then offered as preliminaries to a conference. The Dutch inveighed again&s;t his in&s;incerity for thus retracting his former offers; not con|&s;idering that he certainly had a right to retract tho&s;e offers, which they formerly had rejected. They &s;till had rea&s;ons for protracting the war, and the duke took care to confirm them in this re&s;olution. Neverthele&s;s, the French king
<PB N="154" REF="156">
&s;eeing the mi&s;ery of his people daily encrea&s;e, and all his re&s;ources fail, continued to humble him&s;elf before the allies; and by means of Pet|kum, who &s;till corre&s;ponded from the Hague with his mini&s;ters, implored the Dutch that the negociation might be re&s;umed. A conference was at length begun at Gertruydenburgh, un|der the influence of Marlborough, Eugene, and Zinzendorff, who were all three, from private motives, entirely aver&s;e to the treaty. Upon this occa&s;ion, the French mini&s;ters were &s;ubject|ed to every &s;pecies of mortification. Spies were placed upon all their conduct. Their ma&s;ter was in&s;ulted, and their letters were opened. The Dutch deputies would hear of no relaxation, and no expedient for removing the difficulties that retarded the negociation. The French commi&s;&s;ioners offered to &s;atisfy every complaint that had given ri&s;e to the war. They con&s;ented to abandon Philip of Spain; they agreed to grant the Dutch a large barrier; they even were willing to grant a &s;upply towards the dethroning of Philip; but all their offers were treated with contempt. They were, therefore, compelled to return home, after hav|ing &s;ent a letter to the &s;tates, in which they declared that the propo&s;als made by their deputies were unju&s;t and impracticable, and
<PB N="155" REF="157">
complained of the unworthy treatment they received. Lewis re&s;olved to hazard another campaign, not without hope that &s;ome lucky incident in the event of war, or &s;ome happy change in the mini&s;try of England, might pro|cure him more favourable conce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But though the duke by this means pro|tracted his power on the continent, all his in|fluence at home was at an end. The mem|bers of the hou&s;e of commons, that had been elected ju&s;t after Sacheverel's trial, were almo&s;t univer&s;ally Tories. From all parts of the kingdom addre&s;&s;es were &s;ent and pre&s;ented to the queen, confirming the doctrine of non-re|&s;i&s;tance; and the queen did not &s;cruple to re|ceive them with &s;ome plea&s;ure. But when the conferences were ended at Gertruydenburgh, the de&s;igns of the Dutch and Engli&s;h com|manders were too obvious not to be perceived. The writers of the Tory faction, who were men of the fir&s;t rank in literary merit, and who &s;till more chimed in with the popular opinion, di&s;played the avarice of the duke, and the &s;elf-intere&s;ted conduct of the Dutch. They pretended, that while England was ex|hau&s;ting her &s;trength in foreign conque&s;ts for the benefit of other nations, &s;he was lo&s;ing her liberty at home. They a&s;&s;erted that her
<PB N="156" REF="158">
mini&s;ters were not contented with &s;haring the plunder of an unpoveri&s;hed &s;tate, but, by con|trolling their queen, were re&s;olved to &s;eize upon its liberties al&s;o.</P>
<P>A part of the&s;e complaints was true, and a part exaggerated; but the real crime of the mini&s;try, in the queen's eye, was their pride, their combinations, and their encrea&s;ing power. The in&s;olence of the dutche&s;s of Marlborough, who had hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more power than the whole privy-council united, was now be|come in&s;upportable to her. The queen had entirely withdrawn her confidence from her; and &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportu|nity of &s;hewing her re&s;entment, and &s;uch an opportunity was not long wanting.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who was colonel of a regiment under the duke, the queen re&s;olved to be&s;tow it on a per&s;on &s;he knew was entirely di&s;plea&s;ing to him. She therefore &s;ent him word, that &s;he wi&s;hed he would give it to Mr. Hill, brother to her fa|vourite Mrs. Ma&s;ham, as a per&s;on every way qualified for the command. The duke was &s;truck with this reque&s;t, which he con&s;idered as a previous &s;tep to his own di&s;grace. He repre|&s;ented to the queen the prejudice that would redound to the &s;ervice from the promotion of
<PB N="157" REF="159">
&s;o young an officer, and the jealou&s;y that would be felt by his &s;eniors, never con&s;idering that he him&s;elf was a younger officer than many of tho&s;e he commanded. He expo&s;tulated with her on this extraordinary mark of partiality in favour of Mrs. Ma&s;ham's brother, who had treated him with &s;uch peculiar ingratitude. To all this the queen made no other reply, but that he would do well to con&s;ult his friends. He retired in di&s;gu&s;t, and &s;at down to prepare a letter to the queen, in which he begged leave to re&s;ign all his employments.</P>
<P>In the mean time the queen, who was con|&s;cious of the popularity of her conduct, went to the council, where &s;he &s;eemed not to take the lea&s;t notice of the duke's ab&s;ence. The whole junto of his friends, which almo&s;t en|tirely compo&s;ed the council, did not fail to alarm her with the con&s;equences of di&s;obliging &s;o u&s;eful a &s;ervant. She, therefore, for &s;ome time di&s;&s;embled her re&s;entment; and even went &s;o far as to &s;end the duke a letter, empowering him to di&s;po&s;e of the regiment as he thought proper. But &s;till &s;he was too &s;en&s;ibly mor|tified at many parts of his conduct, not to wi&s;h for his removal; but &s;he for the pre|&s;ent in&s;i&s;ted on his continuing in com|mand.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160">She acted with le&s;s duplicity towards the dutche&s;s, who, &s;uppo&s;ing from the queen's pre|&s;ent conde&s;cen&s;ion, that &s;he was willing to be pacified, re&s;olved once more to practi&s;e the long-forgotten arts by which &s;he ro&s;e. She, therefore, demanded an audience of her ma|je&s;ty, on pretence of vindicating her character from &s;ome a&s;per&s;ions. She hoped to work upon the queen's tenderne&s;s, by tears, entrea|ties, and &s;upplications. But all her humi|liations, &s;erved only to render her more con|temptible to her&s;elf. The queen heard her without exhibiting the lea&s;t emotions of tenderne&s;s or pity. The only an&s;wer &s;he gave to the torrent of the other's entrea|ties, was a repetition of an in&s;olent expre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed in one of this lady's own letters to her.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You de&s;ired no an&s;wer, and you &s;hall have none."</Q></P>
<P>It was only by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, that the queen &s;eemed to acquire courage enough to &s;econd her inclinations, and depo&s;e a mini&s;try that had long been di&s;agreeable to her. Har|ley, however, who &s;till &s;hared her confidence, did not fail to inculcate the popularity, the ju&s;tice, and the &s;ecurity of &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and in con&s;equence of his advice, &s;he began the changes, by transferring the po&s;t of lord cham|berlain
<PB N="159" REF="161">
from the duke of Kent to the duke of Shrew&s;bury, who had lately voted with the Tories, and maintained an intimate corre&s;|pondence with Mr. Harley. Soon after the earl of Sunderland, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and &s;on-in-law to the duke of Marlborough, was di&s;placed, and the earl of Dartmouth put in his room. Finding that &s;he was rather ap|plauded than condemned for this re&s;olute pro|ceeding, &s;he re&s;olved to become entirely free.</P>
<P>In the&s;e re&s;olutions &s;he was &s;trengthened by the duke of Beaufort, who coming to court on this occa&s;ion, informed her maje&s;ty that he came once more to pay his duty to the <HI>Queen.</HI> The whole Whig party were in con&s;ternation; they influenced the directors of the bank, &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ure her maje&s;ty that public credit would be entirely ruined by this change in the mini&s;try. The Dutch moved Heaven and earth with memorials and threats, &s;hould a change take place. However, the queen went forward in her de&s;igns: &s;oon after the earl of Godolphin was dive&s;ted of his office, and the trea&s;ury put in commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ubjected to the direction of Harley, who was appointed chan|cellor of the exchequer, and under-trea&s;urer. The earl of Roche&s;ter was declared pre&s;ident of the council, in the room of lord Somers.
<PB N="160" REF="162">
The &s;taff of lord &s;teward being taken from the duke of Devon&s;hire, was given to the duke of Buckingham; and Mr. Boyle was re|moved from the &s;ecretary's office, to make way for Mr. Henry St. John. The lord chan|cellor having re&s;igned the great &s;eal, it was fir&s;t put in commi&s;&s;ion, and then given to Sir Si|mon Harcourt. The earl of Wharton &s;ur|rendered his commi&s;&s;ion of lord lieutenant of Ireland; and that employment was conferred upon the duke of Ormond. Mr. George Granville was appointed &s;ecretary of war, in the room of Mr. Robert Walpole; and in a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of the &s;tate, except the duke of Marlborough. He was &s;till continued the reluctant general of the army; but he ju&s;tly con&s;idered him&s;elf as a ruin entirely undermined, and ju&s;t ready to fall.</P>
<P>But the triumph was not yet complete, un|til the parliament was brought to confirm and approve the queen's choice. The queen, in her &s;peech, recommended the pro&s;ecution of the war with vigour. The parliament were ar|dent in their expre&s;&s;ions of zeal and unanimity. They exhorted her to di&s;countenance all &s;uch principles and mea&s;ures, as had lately threat|ened her royal crown and dignity. This was
<PB N="161" REF="163">
but an opening to what &s;oon after followed. The duke of Marlborough, who but a few months before had been &s;o highly extolled and care&s;&s;ed by the repre&s;entatives of the peo|ple, was now become the object of their hatred and reproach. His avarice was ju&s;tly upbraid|ed; his protracting the war was &s;aid to ari&s;e from that motive. In&s;tances were every where given of his fraud and extortion. The&s;e might be true, but party had no moderation, and even his courage and conduct were called in que&s;tion. To mortify the duke &s;till more, the thanks of the hou&s;e of commons were voted to the earl of Peterborough for his &s;ervices in Spain, when they were refu&s;ed to the duke for tho&s;e in Flanders; and the lord keeper, who delivered them to Peterborough, took occa&s;ion to drop &s;ome reflections again&s;t the mercenary di&s;po&s;ition of his rival.</P>
<P>In this ebullition of party re&s;entment, Har|ley, who fir&s;t rai&s;ed the ferment, &s;till kept the appearance of moderation; and even became &s;u&s;pected by his more violent a&s;&s;ociates as a lukewarm friend to the cau&s;e. An accident encrea&s;ed his confidence with his own party, and fixed him for a time &s;ecurely in the queen's favour. One Gui&s;card, a French officer, who had made &s;ome u&s;eful informations relative to
<PB N="162" REF="164">
the affairs of France, thought him&s;elf ill reward|ed for his &s;ervices to the crown by a precarious pen&s;ion of four hundred pounds a-year. He had often endeavoured to get to the &s;peech of the queen, but was &s;till repul&s;ed, either by Har|ley or St. John. Enraged at the&s;e di&s;appoint|ments, he attempted to make his peace with the court of France, and offered his &s;ervices in a letter to one Moreau, a banker in Paris. His letters, however, were intercepted, and a war|rant i&s;&s;ued out to apprehend him for high trea&s;on. Con&s;cious of his guilt, and knowing that the charge could be proved again&s;t him, he did not decline his fate, but re&s;olved to &s;weeten his death by vengeance. Being conveyed be|fore the council, convened at a place called the Cock-pit, he perceived a penknife lying upon the table, and took it up, without being ob&s;erved by any of the attendants. When que&s;tioned before the members of the council, he endea|voured to evade his examination, and entreat|ed to &s;peak with Mr. &s;ecretary St. John in pri|vate. His reque&s;t, however, being refu&s;ed, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"That's hard! not one word!"</Q> Up|on which, as St. John was out of reach, he &s;tept up to Mr. Harley, and crying out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Have at <HI>thee</HI> then!"</Q>
he &s;tabbed him in the brea&s;t with the penknife which he had concealed. The
<PB N="163" REF="165">
blade of the knife broke upon the rib, with|out entering the cavity of the brea&s;t; never|thele&s;s he repeated the blow with &s;uch vio|lence that Harley fell to the ground. St. John perceiving what had happened, in&s;tantly drew his &s;word, and &s;everal others following his ex|ample, Gui&s;card was wounded in &s;everal places. He &s;till, however, continued to &s;trike and de|fend him&s;elf, till at la&s;t he was overpowered by the me&s;&s;engers and &s;ervants, and conveyed from the council-chamber, which he had filled with terror and confu&s;ion. His wounds, though dangerous, were not mortal; but he died of a gangrene, occa&s;ioned by the brui&s;es which he had &s;u&s;tained. This un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, &s;till more &s;erved to e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of Harley; and as he appeared the enemy of France, no doubt was made but that he mu&s;t be the friend of England.</P>
<P>This accident &s;erved to demon&s;trate the po|litical rectitude of the mini&s;try, with re&s;pect to the &s;tate. A bill which they brought in, and pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es, &s;erved to a&s;&s;ure the nation of their fidelity to the church. This was an act for building fifty new churches in the city and &s;uburbs of London, and a duty on coals was appropriated for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">Nothing now, therefore, remained of the Whig &s;y&s;tem, upon which this reign was begun, but the war which continued to rage as fierce as ever, and which encrea&s;ed in expence every year as it went on. It was the re&s;olution of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try to put an end to it at any rate, as it had involved the nation in debt al|mo&s;t to bankruptcy; and as it promi&s;ed, in|&s;tead of humbling the enemy, only to become habitual to the con&s;titution. However, it was a very delicate point for the mini&s;try at pre&s;ent, to &s;tem the tide of popular prejudice in favour of its continuance. The nation had been intoxicated with a childi&s;h idea of military glory; and panted for triumphs, which they neither &s;aw nor felt the benefit of. The plea|&s;ure of talking at their entertainments and meetings of their di&s;tant conque&s;ts, and of ex|tolling the bravery of their acquaintance, was all the return they were likely to receive for a dimini&s;hed people, and an exhau&s;ted exche|quer. The fir&s;t doubts, therefore, of the ex|pedience of continuing the war, were introdu|ced into the hou&s;e of commons. The members made a remon&s;trance to the queen, in which they complained loudly of the former admini&s;|tration. They &s;aid, that in tracing the cau&s;es of the national debt, they had di&s;covered great
<PB N="165" REF="167">
frauds and embezzlements of the public mo|ney. They affirmed, that irreparable mi&s;chief would have en&s;ued, in ca&s;e the former mini&s;ters had been continued in office; and they thanked the queen for their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having thus prepared the nation, it only now remained to remove the duke of Marl|borough from his po&s;t, as he would endeavour to traver&s;e all their negotiations. But here again a difficulty &s;tarted, this &s;tep could not be taken without giving offence to the Dutch, who placed entire confidence in him; they were obliged, therefore, to wait for &s;ome convenient occa&s;ion. But in the mean time, the duke headed his army in Flanders, and led on his forces again&s;t mar&s;hal Villars, who &s;eemed re|&s;olved to hazard a battle. His la&s;t attempt in the field, is &s;aid, by tho&s;e who under&s;tand the art of war, to have excelled every former ex|ploit. He contrived his mea&s;ures &s;o, that he induced the enemy, by marching and counter|marching, to quit a &s;trong line of intrench|ments without &s;triking a blow, which he came and unexpectedly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. The capture of Bouchain followed this enterprize, which capitulated after a &s;iege of twenty days; and this was the la&s;t military expedition that the duke of Marlborough ever performed.
<PB N="166" REF="168">
And now, by a continuance of conduct and &s;ucce&s;s, by ever advancing, and never lo&s;ing an advantage, by gaining the enemies po&s;ts without fighting, and the confidence of his own &s;oldiers without genero&s;ity, the duke of Marlborough ended his campaigns, by leaving the allies in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a va&s;t tract of coun|try. They had reduced, under their com|mand, Spani&s;h Guelderland, Limbourg, Bra|bant, Flanders, and Hainault; they were ma&s;|ters of the Scarpe, and the capture of Bou|chain had opened them a way into the very bowels of France. Upon his return from this campaign, he was accu&s;ed of having taken a bribe of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a-year from a Jew, who contracted to &s;upply the army with bread; and the queen thought proper to di&s;|mi&s;s him from all his employments.</P>
<P>This was the pretext made u&s;e of, though his fall had been predetermined; and though his receiving &s;uch a bribe was not the real cau&s;e of his removal, yet candour mu&s;t confe&s;s that it ought to have been &s;o. The de&s;ire of ac|cumulating money, was a pa&s;&s;ion that attend|ed this general in all his triumphs; and by this he threw a &s;tain upon his character, which all his great abilities have not been able to re|move. He not only received this gratuity,
<PB N="167" REF="169">
of &s;ix thou&s;and a-year, from Medina the Jew, but he was al&s;o allowed ten thou&s;and pounds a year from the queen; to this he added a de|duction of two and a half per cent. from the pay of the foreign troops maintained by Eng|land, and all this over and above his ordinary pay as general of the Briti&s;h forces. Many ex|cu&s;es might have been given for his accept|ance of the&s;e &s;ums; but a great character ought not to &s;tand in need of any excu&s;e.</P>

<P>WAR &s;eems, in general, more adapted to the temper and the courage of the Whigs than the Tories. The former, re&s;tle&s;s, active, and ungovernable, &s;eem to delight in the &s;truggle; the latter, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, temperate, and weak, more willingly cultivate the arts of peace, and are content in pro&s;perity. Through the cour&s;e of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, France &s;eems to have been the peculiar object of the hatred of the Whigs; and a con&s;titutional war with that country, &s;eems to have been their aim. On the contrary, the Tories have been found to regard that nation with no &s;uch oppo&s;ition of principle; and a peace with France has ge|nerally been the re&s;ult of a Tory admini&s;tra|tion. For &s;ome time, therefore, before the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of Marlborough, a negociation for peace had been carried on between the court of France and the new mini&s;try. They had a double aim in bringing this about. It would &s;erve to mortify the Whigs, and it would free
<PB N="169" REF="171">
their country from a ruinous and unnece&s;&s;ary war.</P>
<P>The motives of every political mea&s;ure, where faction enters, are partly good, and partly evil. The pre&s;ent mini&s;ters were, with|out doubt, actuated as well by hatred on one hand, as impelled by a love of their country on the other. They hoped to obtain &s;uch ad|vantages in point of commerce for the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, as would &s;ilence all detraction. They were not &s;o very mindful of the intere&s;ts of the Dutch, as they knew that people to be but too attentive to tho&s;e intere&s;ts them&s;elves. In order, therefore, to come as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the end in view, the earl of Jer&s;ey, who acted in concert with Oxford, &s;ent a private me&s;&s;age to the court of France, importing the queen's earne&s;t de&s;ire for peace, and her wi&s;h for a renewal of the conference. This intima|tion was delivered by one Gualtier, an ob&s;cure prie&s;t, who was chaplain to the Imperial am|ba&s;&s;ador, and a &s;py for the French court. The me&s;&s;age was received with great plea&s;ure at the French court, and an an&s;wer was returned, ardently profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame inclinations. This led the way to a reply, and &s;oon after to a more definitive memorial from the court of France,
<PB N="170" REF="172">
which was immediately tran&s;mitted to the Dutch by the queen, for their approbation.</P>
<P>The &s;tates-general having peru&s;ed the French memorial, a&s;&s;ured queen Anne that they were ready to join with her in contri|buting to the conclu&s;ion of a durable peace; but they expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that the French king would be more explicit in his offers to|wards &s;ettling the repo&s;e of Europe. In order to give the Dutch &s;ome &s;atisfaction in this par|ticular, a previous conference between the French and Engli&s;h courts took place. Prior, much more famous as a poet than as a &s;tate&s;|man, was &s;ent over with propo&s;als to France; and Menager, a man of no great &s;tation, re|turned with Prior to London, with full powers to treat upon the preliminaries. After long and intricate debates, certain preliminary ar|ticles were at la&s;t agreed on, and &s;igned by the Engli&s;h and French mini&s;ter, in con&s;equence of a written order from her maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try having got thus far, the great difficulty &s;till lay before them, of making the terms of peace agreeable to all the confederates. The earl of Stafford, who had been lately re|called from the Hague, where he re&s;ided as amba&s;&s;ador, was now &s;ent back to Holland,
<PB N="171" REF="173">
with orders to communicate to the pen&s;ionary Hein&s;ius, the preliminary propo&s;als, to &s;ignify the queen's approbation of them, and to pro|po&s;e a place where the plenipotentiaries &s;hould a&s;&s;emble. The Dutch were very aver&s;e to be|gin the conference, upon the in&s;pection of the preliminaries. They &s;ent over an envoy to attempt to turn the queen from her re&s;olution, but finding their efforts vain, they fixed upon Utrecht as the place of general conference, and they granted pa&s;&s;ports to the French mini&s;ters accordingly.</P>
<P>Many were the methods made u&s;e of by the Dutch, as well as by the Germans, to fru&s;trate the negociations of this congre&s;s. The emperor wrote circular letters to the princes of the em|pire, exhorting them to per&s;i&s;t in their former engagements. His amba&s;&s;ador in London getting a copy of the preliminary articles, had them in&s;erted in a common news-paper, in or|der to throw blame upon the mini&s;try, and ren|der their proceedings odious to the people. The Dutch began to complain of perfidy, and laboured to rai&s;e a di&s;content in England a|gain&s;t the mea&s;ures then in &s;peculation. The Whigs in London did not fail to &s;econd their efforts with all the arts of clamour, ridicule, and reproach. Pamphlets, libels, and lam|poons,
<PB N="172" REF="174">
were every day publi&s;hed by one fac|tion, and the next were an&s;wered by the other. But the confederates took a &s;tep from which they hoped &s;ucce&s;s from the greatne&s;s of the agent whom they employed. Prince Eugene, who had been long famous for his talents in the cabinet and in the field, was &s;ent over with a letter from the emperor to the queen. But his intrigues and his arts were unable to pre|vail; he found at court, indeed, a polite re|ception, &s;uch as was due to his merits and his fame; but at the &s;ame time &s;uch a repul&s;e, as the private propo&s;als he carried &s;eemed to de|&s;erve. Still, therefore, mea&s;ures for the con|ference were going forward, and the mini&s;try were determined to drive them on to a con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>However, before we mention the re&s;ult of this great congre&s;s, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ap|prize the reader, that many of the motives which fir&s;t incited each &s;ide to take up arms were now no more. Charles of Au&s;tria, for who&s;e cau&s;e England had &s;pent &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, was, by the death of his elder brother, the emperor Jo&s;eph, placed on the imperial throne. There was, therefore, every rea&s;on for not &s;upporting his pre|ten&s;ions to the Spani&s;h monarchy; and the
<PB N="173" REF="175">
&s;ame jealou&s;y which invited him to that king|dom, was nece&s;&s;ary to be exerted in keeping him out of it. The elector of Bavaria, who was intimately connected with the French, was now detached from them; and the Dutch, who had trembled for their barrier, were encroaching upon that of the enemy. Thus accident and &s;ucce&s;s gave almo&s;t every power, but France and England, all that war could grant; and though they &s;hould be crowned with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, it was the intere&s;t of England that her allies &s;hould be rein&s;tated in their rights, but not rendered too powerful.</P>
<P>The conferences began at Utrecht, under the conduct of Robin&s;on, bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol, lord privy-&s;eal, and the earl of Stafford, on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h; of Buys and Vanderdu&s;&s;en, on the part of the Dutch; and of the mar&s;hal D'Uxelles, the cardinal Polignac, and Mr. Menager, in behalf of France. The mini&s;ters of the Emperor and Savoy a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and the other allies &s;ent al&s;o plenipotentiaries, though with the utmo&s;t reluctance. As England and France were the only two powers that were &s;eriou&s;ly inclined to peace, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed that all the other deputies &s;erved rather to retard than advance its progre&s;s. They met rather to &s;tart new difficulties, and widen
<PB N="174" REF="176">
the breach, than to quiet the di&s;&s;entions of Eu|rope. The emperor in&s;i&s;ted ob&s;tinately upon his claim to the Spani&s;h monarchy, refu&s;ing to give up the lea&s;t tittle of his preten&s;ions. The Dutch adhered to the old preliminaries, which Lewis had formerly rejected. They practi&s;ed a thou&s;and little arts to intimidate the queen, to excite a jealou&s;y of Lewis, to blacken the characters of her mini&s;try, and to keep up a dangerous ferment among the peo|ple.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try were &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous and difficult ta&s;k they had to &s;u&s;tain. The confederates were entirely again&s;t them, a violent and de&s;perate party at home, who never let any government re&s;t, except when them&s;elves were in power, oppo&s;ed; none to &s;econd their efforts heartily, but the commons and the queen, who&s;e health was vi&s;ibly declining. They had, by a bold mea&s;ure indeed, &s;ecured the hou&s;e of lords on their &s;ide, by creating twelve new peers in one day; and this turned the ba|lance, which was yet wavering, in their favour. But in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, therefore, di&s;|patch was greatly requi&s;ite. In ca&s;e of their &s;overeign's death, they had nothing to expect but pro&s;ecution and ruin for obeying her com|mands, unle&s;s there was time given to draw
<PB N="175" REF="177">
the people from the intoxication of their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, and until the utility of their mea&s;ures were found ju&s;tified by the people's happy ex|perience. Thus the peace was ha&s;tened, and this ha&s;te relaxed the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters &s;everi|ty, in in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;uch terms and advantages as they had a right to demand.</P>
<P>With the&s;e views the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, find|ing multiplied ob&s;tructions from the delibera|tions of their allies, &s;et on foot a private ne|gotiation with France. They &s;tipulated cer|tain advantages for the &s;ubjects of Great Bri|tain in a concerted plan of peace. They re|&s;olved to enter into &s;uch mutual confidence with the French, as would anticipate all clan|de&s;tine tran&s;actions to the prejudice of the coalition. The&s;e articles were privately regu|lated between the two courts; but being the re&s;ult of ha&s;te and nece&s;&s;ity, they were not quite &s;o favourable to the Engli&s;h intere&s;ts as the &s;anguine part of the nation were taught to expect.</P>
<P>Mean while the French plenipotentiaries at Utrecht proceeded &s;o far as to deliver their propo&s;als in writing under the name of &s;peci|fic offers, which the confederates treated with indignation and contempt, who, on the other hand, drew up their &s;pecific demands, which
<PB N="176" REF="178">
were con&s;idered as highly extravagant by the mini&s;ters of France. Conference followed confe|rence; but &s;till the contending parties continued as remote from each other as when they begun. The Engli&s;h, willing to include their allies if po&s;&s;ible in the treaty, departed from &s;ome of their &s;ecret preten&s;ions, in order to gratify the Dutch with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome towns in Flanders. They con&s;ented to admit that nation into a participation of &s;ome advantages in commerce. The queen, therefore, finding the confede|rates &s;till ob&s;tinately attached to their fir&s;t pre|liminaries, &s;he gave them to under&s;tand, that as they failed to co-operate with her openly and &s;incerely, and had made &s;uch bad returns for all her conde&s;cen&s;ion towards them, &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as relea&s;ed from all en|gagements.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance of di&s;plea&s;ure which was &s;hewn to the confederates, was by an or|der given to the Engli&s;h army in Flanders not to act upon the offen&s;ive. Upon the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of the duke of Marlborough, the duke of Ormond had been inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme command of the Briti&s;h forces; but with particular directions that he &s;hould not hazard an engagement. However, he joined prince Eugene at Tournay, who, not being
<PB N="177" REF="179">
let into the &s;ecret, advi&s;ed the attacking Vil|lars; but he &s;oon found how affairs &s;tood with his coadjutor. Ormond him&s;elf &s;eemed ex|tremely unea&s;y at his &s;ituation; and, in a let|ter to the &s;ecretary in England, de&s;ired per|mi&s;&s;ion to return home. But the confe|derates were loud in their complaints; they expo&s;tulated with the mini&s;ters at Utrecht upon &s;o perfidious a conduct; but they were told that letters had been lately received from the queen, in which &s;he complained, that as the &s;tates-general had not properly an&s;wered her advances, they ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed, if &s;he thought her&s;elf at liberty to enter into &s;eparate mea&s;ures to obtain a peace for her own advantage.</P>
<P>But the Dutch did not re&s;t here. They had a powerful party in the hou&s;e of lords, and there they re&s;olved to arraign the conduct of the mini&s;try. Lord Halifax de&s;canted on the ill con&s;equences of the duke of Ormond's re|fu&s;ing to co-operate with prince Eugene, and moved for an addre&s;s to her maje&s;ty to loo&s;e the hands of the Engli&s;h general. It was urged that nothing could be more di&s;graceful to the duke him&s;elf than being thus &s;et at the head of an army without a power of acting. But the earl Pawlet replied, that though none
<PB N="178" REF="180">
could doubt of the duke of Ormond's cou|rage, yet he was not like a certain general, who led troops to the &s;laughter, in hopes that a great number of officers might be knocked on the head, that he might encrea&s;e his trea&s;ures by di&s;po&s;ing of their commi&s;&s;ions. The duke of Marlborough, who was pre&s;ent, was &s;o deeply affected at this malicious in&s;inuation, that he &s;ent the earl a challenge the next day; but the nature of the me&s;&s;age coming to the queen's ears, the duke was ordered to proceed no fur|ther in the quarrel.</P>
<P>In the mean time the allies, deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, &s;till continued their animo&s;ity again&s;t the French, and were re|&s;olved to continue the war &s;eparately. They had the utmo&s;t confidence in prince Eugene, their general; and though le&s;&s;ened by the de|fection of the Briti&s;h forces, they were &s;till &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the enemy commanded by mar&s;hal Villars. But the lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h forces was &s;oon &s;everely felt by the allied army. Villars attacked a &s;eparate body of their troops, encamped at Denain, under the command of the earl of Albemarle. Their intrenchments were forced, and &s;eventeen battalions either de|&s;troyed or taken. The earl him&s;elf, and all the &s;urviving officers, were made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Villars &s;erved to ha&s;ten the treaty of Utrecht. The great ob&s;tacle which retarded that peace which France and England &s;eemed &s;o ardently to de&s;ire, was the &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the kingdoms of France and Spain. The danger that threat|ened the intere&s;ts of Europe was, le&s;t both kingdoms &s;hould be united under one &s;ove|reign; and Philip, who was now king of Spain, &s;tood next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of France, except with the interpo&s;ition of one child, the pre&s;ent French king, who was then &s;ickly. Philip, however, after many expedi|ents, at la&s;t re&s;olved to wave his preten&s;ions to the French monarchy, and the treaty went forward with rapidity and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the beginning of Augu&s;t,<MILESTONE N="1712" UNIT="A.D."> &s;ecretary St. John, now created lord vi&s;count Bolingbroke, was &s;ent to the court of Ver&s;ailles to remove all ob&s;tructions to the &s;eparate treaty. He was accompanied by Mr. Prior, and the abb&eacute; Gualtier, and treated with the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect. He was care&s;&s;ed by the French king, and the marquis de Tor|cy, with whom he adju&s;ted the principal in|tere&s;ts of the duke of Savoy, and the elector of Bavaria. This negociation being fini&s;hed in a few days, Bolingbroke returned to Eng|land,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
and Prior remained as re&s;ident at the court of France.</P>
<P>In the mean time the articles of the in|tended treaty were warmly canva&s;&s;ed among all ranks of people in London. A duel, which was fought between the duke of Ha|milton and lord Mohun, in which they were both killed, &s;erved to exa&s;perate the Whigs and Tories again&s;t each other. The &s;ubject of the duel is &s;aid to have been a law-&s;uit; but as Mohun was con&s;idered as bully in fa|vour of the Whigs, the Tories exclaimed again&s;t the event as a party duel; and ab|&s;urdly affirmed that a plot was laid again&s;t the duke of Hamilton's life. Mobs now began to be hired by both factions, and the whole city was filled with riot and uproar. In this &s;cene of confu&s;ion, the duke of Marlborough hearing him&s;elf accu&s;ed as the &s;ecret author of the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, thought proper to retire to the continent; and his retreat was compared by his party to that of Scipio from Rome, after he had &s;aved his country.</P>
<P>At length, the treaties of peace and com|merce between England and France being agreed on by the plenipotentiaries on either &s;ide, and ratified by the queen, &s;he acquainted her parliament of the &s;teps &s;he had taken. She
<PB N="181" REF="183">
informed them of her precautions to &s;ecure them the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a prote&s;tant king; and de&s;ired them to con&s;ider by her actions whether &s;he ever meant to divide her intere&s;ts from the hou&s;e of Hanover. She left it to the commons to determine what forces, and what &s;upplies might be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the kingdom.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Make your&s;elves &s;afe, &s;aid &s;he, and I &s;hall be &s;atisfied. The affection of my people, and the providence of heaven, are the only guards I a&s;k for my protection."</Q>
Both hou&s;es pre&s;ented her warm addre&s;&s;es; and the ratifications of the treaty being exchanged, peace was proclaimed on the fifth of May, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the majority of the nation.</P>
<P>The articles of this famous peace were longer canva&s;&s;ed, and more warmly debated, than tho&s;e of any other treaty read of in hi&s;|tory. The number of different intere&s;ts con|cerned, and the great enmity and jealou&s;y &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between all, made it impo&s;&s;ible that all could be &s;atisfied; and indeed there &s;eemed no other method of obtaining peace but that which was taken, for the two principal pow|ers concerned to make their own articles, and to leave the re&s;t for a &s;ubject of future di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184">The fir&s;t &s;tipulation was, that Philip, now acknowledged king of Spain, &s;hould renounce all right to the crown of France, the union of two &s;uch powerful kingdoms being thought dangerous to the liberties of Europe. It was agreed that the duke of Berry, Philip's bro|ther, and after him in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould al&s;o renounce his right to the crown of Spain, in ca&s;e he became king of France. It was &s;tipu|lated that the duke of Savoy &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the i&s;land of Sicily, with the title of king, to|gether with Fene&s;trelles, and other places on the continent, which encrea&s;e of dominion was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, made out of the &s;poils of the French monarchy. The Dutch had that barrier granted them, which they &s;o long &s;ought after; and if the crown of France was deprived of &s;ome dominions to enrich the duke of Savoy, on the other hand the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was taxed to &s;upply the wants of the Hollanders, who were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tronge&s;t towns in Flanders. With regard to England, its glory and its intere&s;ts were &s;e|cured. The fortifications of Dunkirk, an harbour that might be dangerous to their trade in time of war, were ordered to be demoli&s;h|ed, and its port de&s;troyed. Spain gave up all right to Gibraltar, and the i&s;land of Minorca.
<PB N="183" REF="185">
France re&s;igned her preten&s;ions to Hud&s;on's Bay, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland; but they were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape Breton, and the liberty of drying their fi&s;h upon the &s;hore. Among tho&s;e articles, glorious to the Engli&s;h nation, their &s;etting free the French prote&s;tants confined in the pri&s;ons and gallies for their religion was not the lea&s;t meritorious. For the emperor it was &s;tipulated, that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, and the Spani&s;h Nether|lands. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia was to have Up|per Guelder; and a time was fixed for the em|peror's acceding to the&s;e articles, as he had for &s;ome time refu&s;ed ob&s;tinately to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the negociation. Thus Europe &s;eemed to be formed into one great republic, the different members of which were cantoned out to dif|ferent governors, and the ambition of any one &s;tate amenable to the tribunal of all. Thus it appears that the Engli&s;h mini&s;try did ju&s;tice to all the world; but their country denied that ju&s;tice to them.</P>
<P>The Dutch and the Imperiali&s;ts, after com|plaining of this de&s;ertion in their allies, re|&s;olved to hold out for &s;ome time. But they al&s;o &s;oon after concluded a peace, the one by the barrier treaty, and the other by the treaty
<PB N="184" REF="186">
of Ra&s;tadt, in which their intere&s;ts were a&s;cer|tained, and the treaty of Utrecht confirmed.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h being in this manner freed from their foreign enemies, had now full lei|&s;ure to indulge their dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions. The two parties never contended with greater ani|mo&s;ity, nor greater inju&s;tice, again&s;t each other. No merit could be allowed in tho&s;e of the op|po&s;ite faction, and no knavery &s;een in their own. Whether it was at this time the wi&s;h of the mini&s;ters to alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown from the hou&s;e of Hanover to the pre|tender, cannot now be clearly made out; but true it is that the Whigs believed it as certain, and the Tories but faintly denied the charge. The &s;u&s;picions of that party became every day &s;tronger, particularly when they &s;aw a total removal of the Whigs from all places of tru&s;t and confidence throughout the kingdom, and their employments be&s;towed on profe&s;&s;ed To|ries, &s;uppo&s;ed to be maintainers of an unbroken hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Whigs were all in commotion, either apprehending, or affecting to apprehend, a de&s;ign in favour of the pre|tender; nay their reports went &s;o far as to a&s;|&s;ert that he was actually concealed in London, and that he had held &s;everal conferences with the mini&s;ters of &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187">Be this as it will, the chiefs of the Whig faction held &s;ecret conferences with baron Schutz, re&s;ident from the court of Hanover. They communicated their fears and appre|hen&s;ions to the elector, who, before he arrived in England, or con&s;idered the &s;pirit of par|ties, was thoroughly prejudiced again&s;t the To|ries. In return they received his in&s;tructions, and were taught to expect his favour in ca&s;e of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The hou&s;e of lords &s;eemed to &s;hare in the general apprehen&s;ion. The queen was addre&s;&s;ed to know what &s;teps had been taken for removing the pretender from the do|minions of the duke of Lorrain. They begged &s;he would give them a li&s;t of &s;uch per|&s;ons as having been once attainted for their political mi&s;conduct, had obtained licences to return into Great Britain &s;ince the Revo|lution. Mr. Steele, afterwards known as the celebrated Sir Richard Steele, was not a little active in rai&s;ing and &s;preading the&s;e re|ports. In a pamphlet written by him, called the Cri&s;is, he bitterly exclaimed again&s;t the mini&s;try, and the immediate danger of their bringing in the pretender. The hou&s;e of commons con&s;idered this performance as a &s;candalous and &s;editious libel; and Steele was expelled the hou&s;e, of which he was a member.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188">But while the Whigs were attacking the mi|ni&s;ters from without, the&s;e were in much great|er danger from their own internal di&s;&s;en&s;ions. Harley was created lord Oxford, and St. John lord Bolingbroke. Though they had &s;tarted with the &s;ame principles and de|&s;igns, yet having vanqui&s;hed other oppo&s;ers, they now began to turn their &s;trength again&s;t each other. Never were two tempers wor&s;e matched to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s jointly together. Oxford, cautious, &s;low, diffident, and re&s;erved; Bolingbroke, hot, eager, impetuous, and proud; the fir&s;t of great erudition, the latter of great natural capacity; the fir&s;t ob&s;tinate in com|mand, the other reluctant to obey; the fir&s;t bent on maintaining that rank in the admini|&s;tration, which he had obtained upon the di&s;&s;o|lution of the la&s;t mini&s;try, the other di&s;dain|ing to act as a &s;ubaltern to a man whom he thought him&s;elf able to in&s;truct. Both, there|fore, began to form &s;eparate intere&s;ts, and to adopt different principles. Oxford's plan was the more moderate, Bolingbroke's the more vigorous, but the more &s;ecure. Oxford it is thought was entirely for the Hanover &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; Bolingbroke had &s;ome hopes of bringing in the pretender. But though they hated each other mo&s;t &s;incerely, yet they were for a while
<PB N="187" REF="189">
kept together by the good offices of their friends and adherents, who had the melancholy pro&s;|pect of &s;eeing the citadel of their hopes, while openly be&s;ieged from without, &s;ecretly under|mining within.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying pro&s;pect to the To|ries; but it was more particularly di&s;plea&s;ing to the queen, who daily &s;aw her favourite mini&s;try declining, while her own health kept pace with their contentions. Her con&s;titution was now quite broken. One fit of &s;ickne&s;s &s;ucceeded another; and what completed the ruin of her health, was the anxiety of her mind. The council-chamber was for &s;ome time turn|ed into a &s;cene of ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, and bit|ter altercation. Even in the queen's pre&s;ence, the trea&s;urer and &s;ecretary did not ab&s;tain from mutual obloquy and reproach. As Ox|ford fore&s;aw that the Whig mini&s;try would force them&s;elves in, he was for moderate mea|&s;ures. Bolingbroke, on the contrary, was for &s;etting the Whigs at defiance, and flattered the queen, by giving way to all her favourite attachments. At length, their animo&s;ities coming to an height, Oxford wrote a letter to the queen, containing a detail of public tran&s;|actions, in the cour&s;e of which he endeavoured to ju&s;tify his own conduct, and expo&s;e the tur|bulent
<PB N="188" REF="190">
and ambitious &s;pirit of his rival. On the other hand, Bolingbroke charged the trea|&s;urer with having invited the Duke of Marl|borough to return from his voluntary exile, and of maintaining a private corre&s;pondence with the hou&s;e of Hanover. In con&s;equence of this, and the intrigues of Lady Ma&s;ham, who now &s;econded the aims of Bolingbroke, Ox|ford was removed from his employments, and his rival &s;eemed to triumph in his new victory.</P>
<P>But this paltry triumph was but of &s;hort du|ration. Bolingbroke for a while &s;eemed to enjoy the confu&s;ion he had made; and the whole &s;tate being driven into di&s;order by the &s;uddenne&s;s of the trea&s;urer's fall, he &s;at &s;ecure, con&s;idering that he mu&s;t be called upon to remedy every inconvenience. But the queen's declining health &s;oon began to give him a dreadful pro&s;|pect of his own &s;ituation, and the triumph of his enemies. As no plan had been adopted for &s;upplying the vacancy of trea&s;urer, the queen was perplexed and harra&s;&s;ed with the choice, and &s;he had no longer &s;trength left to &s;upport the fatigue. It had &s;uch an effect upon her &s;pirits and con&s;titution, that &s;he de|clared &s;he could not outlive it, and immediate|ly &s;unk into a &s;tate of lethargic in&s;en&s;ibility. Notwith&s;tanding all the medicines which the
<PB N="189" REF="191">
phy&s;icians could pre&s;cribe, the di&s;temper gained ground &s;o fa&s;t, that the day after they de&s;paired of her life, and the privy-council was a&s;&s;embled on the occa&s;ion.<MILESTONE N="July 30, 1714."> The dukes of Somer&s;et and Argyle being informed of the de&s;perate &s;tate in which &s;he lay, entered the council-chamber without being &s;ummoned, not a little to the &s;urprize of the Tory members, who did not expect their appearance. The duke of Shrew&s;bury thanked them for their readine&s;s to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance at &s;uch a critical junc|ture, and de&s;ired them to take their places. The phy&s;icians having declared that the queen was &s;till in her &s;en&s;es, the council unanimou&s;ly agreed that the duke of Shrew&s;bury was the fitte&s;t per&s;on to be appointed to the vacant office of trea&s;urer. Thus Bolingbroke's ambition was defeated, ju&s;t when he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure.</P>
<P>All the members of the privy-council, with|out di&s;tinction, being now &s;ummoned from the different parts of the kingdom, began to pro|vide for the &s;ecurity of the con&s;titution. They &s;ent a letter to the elector of Hanover, inform|ing him of the queen's de&s;perate &s;ituation, and de&s;iring him to repair to Holland, where he would be attended by a Briti&s;h &s;quadron to convey him to England. At the &s;ame time they di&s;patched in&s;tructions to the earl of
<PB N="190" REF="192">
Strafford at the Hague, to de&s;ire the &s;tates-general to be ready to perform the guaranty of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Precautions were taken to &s;ecure the &s;ea-ports; and the com|mand of the fleet was be&s;towed upon the earl of Berkeley, a profe&s;&s;ed Whig. The&s;e mea|&s;ures, which were all dictated by that party, an&s;wered a double end. It argued their own alacrity in the cau&s;e of their new &s;overeign, and &s;eemed to imply a danger to the &s;tate from the di&s;affection of the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth of July, the queen &s;eemed &s;omewhat relieved by medicines, ro&s;e from her bed about eight o'clock, and walked a little. After &s;ome time, ca&s;ting her eyes on a clock that &s;tood in her chamber, &s;he continued to gaze at it for &s;ome minutes. One of the laides in waiting a&s;ked her what &s;he &s;aw there more than u&s;ual; to which the queen only an&s;wered, by turning her eyes upon her with a dying look. She was &s;oon after &s;eized with a fit of the apo|plexy, from which, however, &s;he was &s;ome|what recovered by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of doctor Mead. She continued all night in a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction. She gave &s;ome &s;igns of life between twelve and one the next day; but ex|pired the following morning, which was the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, a little after &s;even o'clock, in the
<PB N="191" REF="193">
forty-ninth year of her age. She reigned more than twelve years over a people that was now ri&s;en to the highe&s;t pitch of refinement; that had attained by their wi&s;dom all the advantages of opulence, and by their valour all the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ecurity and conque&s;t</P>
<P>This prince&s;s was rather amiable than great, rather plea&s;ing than beautiful; neither her ca|pacity nor learning were remarkable. Like all the re&s;t of her family, &s;he &s;eemed rather fitted for the private duties of life, than a pub|lic &s;tation; being a pattern of conjugal fidelity, a good mother, a warm friend, and an indul|gent mi&s;tre&s;s. During her reign none &s;uffered on the &s;caffold for trea&s;on; for when an op|pre&s;&s;ed faction takes the lead, it is &s;eldom cruel. In her ended the line of the Stuarts; a family who&s;e misfortunes and mi&s;conducts are not to be paralleled in hi&s;tory. A family, who le&s;s than men them&s;elves, &s;eemed to ex|pect from their followers more than manhood in their defence; a family that never rewarded their friends, and never avenged them of their enemies.</P>

<P>THE two parties which had long divided the kingdom, under the names of Whig and Tory, now &s;eemed to alter their titles; and as the old epithets had lo&s;t their virulence by fre|quent u&s;e, the Whigs were now &s;tyled Hano|verians, and the Tories were branded with the appellation of Jacobites. The former boa&s;ted of a prote&s;tant king, the latter of an hereditary
<PB N="193" REF="195">
monarch, the former urged the wi&s;dom of their new monarch, and the latter alledged that theirs was an Engli&s;hman. It is ea&s;y to per|ceive, that the choice would re&s;t upon him who&s;e wi&s;dom and religion promi&s;ed the people the greate&s;t &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The Jacobites had long been flattered with the hopes of &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion altered by the new mini&s;try. Ungrounded hopes, and impracticable &s;chemes, &s;eem to have been the only portion bequeathed to that party. They now found all their expectations bla&s;ted by the premature death of the queen. The diligence and activity of the privy-council, in which the Hanoverian intere&s;t prevailed, the general ri|dicule which attended their incon&s;i&s;tent con|duct, all &s;erved to complete their confu&s;ion. Up|on recollection, they &s;aw nothing &s;o eligi|ble in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, as &s;ilence and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; they hoped much from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, and &s;till more from the popularity and councils of the pretender. This unfortu|nate man, &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qualities of his father; his pride, his want of per&s;everance, and his attachment to the catholic religion. He was but a poor leader, therefore, to con|duct &s;o de&s;perate a cau&s;e; and in fact, all the &s;en&s;ible part of the kingdom had for&s;aken it as irretrievable.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">Pur&s;uant to the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, George the fir&s;t, &s;on of Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, fir&s;t elector of Brun&s;wick, and the prince&s;s Sophia, grand|daughter to James the fir&s;t, a&s;cended the Bri|ti&s;h throne. His mature age, he being now fifty-four years old, his &s;agacity and expe|rience, his numerous alliances, the general tranquility of Europe, all contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h his intere&s;ts, and to promi&s;e him a peaceable and happy reign. His virtues, tho' not &s;hining, were &s;olid; he was of a very different di&s;po&s;i|tion from the Stuart family, whom he &s;ucceed|ed. The&s;e were known, to a proverb, for leaving their friends in extremity; George, on the contrary, &s;oon after his arrival in England, was heard to &s;ay;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My maxim is, never to abandon my friends. To do ju&s;tice to all the world, and to fear no man."</Q>
To the&s;e qualifications of re&s;olution and per&s;everance, he joined great application to bu&s;ine&s;s. How|ever, one fault with re&s;pect to England re|mained behind; he &s;tudied the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e &s;ubjects he had left, more than of tho&s;e he came to govern.</P>
<P>The queen had no &s;ooner re&s;igned her la&s;t breath, than the privy-council met, and three in|&s;truments were produced, by which the elector appointed &s;everal of his known adherents to be added as lords ju&s;tices to the &s;even great
<PB N="195" REF="197">
offices of the kingdom. Orders al&s;o were immediately i&s;&s;ued out for proclaiming George king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The regency appointed the earl of Dor&s;et to carry him the intimation of his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and to attend him in his journey to England. They &s;ent the general officers, in whom they could confide, to their po&s;ts; they rein|forced the garri&s;on of Port&s;mouth, and appoint|ed the celebrated Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ecretary of &s;tate. To mortify the late mini&s;try the more, lord Bo|lingbroke was obliged to wait every morning in the pa&s;&s;age, among the &s;ervants, with his bag of papers, where there were per&s;ons purpo&s;e|ly placed to in&s;ult and deride him. No tu|mult appeared, no commotion aro&s;e again&s;t the acce&s;&s;ion of the new king, and this gave a &s;trong proof that no rational mea&s;ures were ever taken to ob&s;truct his exaltation.</P>
<P>The king fir&s;t landed at Greenwich, where he was received by the duke of Northumber|land, captain of the life-guard, and the lords of the regency. From the landing place, he walked to his hou&s;e in the park, accompanied by a great number of the nobility and other per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who expected to make their court in this reign, in con&s;equence of their turbu|lence and oppo&s;ition to the la&s;t. When he retired to his bed-chamber, he then &s;ent for &s;uch of the
<PB N="196" REF="198">
nobility as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But the duke of Or|mond, the lord chancellor, and the lord trea|&s;urer, found them&s;elves excluded. Lord Ox|ford, the next morning, pre&s;ented him&s;elf with an air of confidence, &s;uppo&s;ing that his rup|ture with Bolingbroke would compen&s;ate for his former conduct. But he had the mortifi|cation to remain a con&s;iderable time unnoticed among the crowd; and then was permitted to ki&s;s the king's hand, without being honoured with any circum&s;tance of peculiar re&s;pect. To mortify him &s;till more, the king expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t uncommon regard for the duke of Marl|borough, who had ju&s;t come from the conti|nent, as well as for all the leaders of the Whig party.</P>
<P>The king of a faction, is but the &s;overeign of half his &s;ubjects. Of this, however, the new-elected monarch did not &s;eem &s;en&s;ible. It was his misfortune, and con&s;equently that of the nation, that he was hemmed round by men, who &s;oured him with all their own in|tere&s;ts and prejudices. None now but the leaders of a party were admitted into employ|ment. The Whigs, while they pretended to &s;ecure the crown for their king, were with all po&s;&s;ible arts confirming their own intere&s;ts, extending their connexions, and giving laws
<PB N="197" REF="199">
to their &s;overeign. An in&s;tantaneous and total change was made in all the offices of tru&s;t, honour, or advantage. The Whigs go|verned the &s;enate and the court; whom they would, they oppre&s;&s;ed; bound the lower orders of people with &s;evere laws, and kept them at a di&s;tance by vile di&s;tinctions; and then taught them to call this&mdash;Liberty.</P>
<P>The&s;e partialities &s;oon rai&s;ed di&s;contents among the people, and the king's attachment con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed the malecontents thro' all the kingdom. The clamour of the church's being in danger was revived, and the people only &s;eemed to want a leader to incite them to in&s;urrection. Birmingham, Bri&s;tol, Norwich, and Reading, &s;till remembered the &s;pirit with which they had declared for Sacheverel; and now the cry was, Down with the Whigs, and Sacheverel for ever.<MILESTONE N="1714" UNIT="A.D."> During the&s;e com|motions, which were fomented by every art, the pretender him&s;elf continued a calm &s;pectator on the continent. Then was the time for him to have &s;truck his greate&s;t blow; but he only &s;ent over his emi&s;&s;aries to di&s;per&s;e his ineffectual manife&s;toes, and delude the un|wary. In the&s;e papers he ob&s;erved, that the late queen had intentions of calling him to the crown. He expo&s;tulated with his people up|on
<PB N="198" REF="200">
the inju&s;tice they had done them&s;elves in proclaiming a foreign prince for their &s;overeign, contrary to the laws of the country that gave him only the real claim. Copies of a printed addre&s;s, were &s;ent to the dukes of Shrew&s;bury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen of the fir&s;t di&s;tiection, vindicating his right to the crown, and complaining of the inju&s;tice of his people. Yet though he &s;till complained of their conduct, he never took one &s;tep to re|form his own, or to correct that objection, up|on which his father had forfeited the throne. He &s;till continued to profe&s;s the true&s;t regard to the catholic religion; and in&s;tead of con|cealing his &s;entiments on that head, gloried in his principles. He expected to a&s;cend the throne again&s;t a very powerful oppo&s;ition, and that by profe&s;&s;ing the very &s;ame principles by which it had beep lo&s;t.</P>
<P>But however odious the popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition was to the bulk of the people at that time, the principles of the di&s;&s;enters were equally di&s;|plea&s;ing. It was again&s;t them and their tenets, that mobs were excited, and riots became fre|quent. How violent &s;oever the conduct of either party &s;eemed to be, yet their animo&s;ities were founded upon religion, and they commit|ed every exce&s;s upon principles, that had their
<PB N="199" REF="201">
foundation in &s;ome mi&s;taken virtue. It was now &s;aid, by the Tories, that impiety and he|re&s;y were daily gaining ground under a Whig admini&s;tration. It was &s;aid, that the bi&s;hops were &s;o lukewarm in favour of the church, and &s;o ardent in pur&s;uit of temporal advantages, that every vice was rearing its head without controul. The doctrines of the true religion, were left expo&s;ed on every &s;ide, and open to the attacks of the di&s;&s;enters and Socinians on one part, and of the catholics on the other. The lower orders of clergy &s;ided with the people in the&s;e complaints; they pointed out to the mini&s;try &s;everal tracts written in favour of Sociniani&s;m and Ariani&s;m. The mini&s;try not only refu&s;ed to puni&s;h the delinquents, but &s;ilenced the clergy them&s;elves, and forbade their future di&s;putations on &s;uch topics. This injunction an&s;wered the immediate purpo&s;e of the mini&s;try; it put a &s;top to the clamours of the populace, fomented by the clergy, but it produced a wor&s;e di&s;order in its train; it pro|duced a negligence in all religious concerns. Nothing can be more impolitic in a &s;tate, than to hinder the clergy from di&s;puting with each other; they thus become more animated in the cau&s;e of religion, and which &s;ide &s;oever they defend, they become wi&s;er and better as
<PB N="200" REF="202">
they carry on the di&s;pute. To &s;ilence argu|ment in the clergy, is to encourage them in &s;loth and neglect; if religion be not kept awake by oppo&s;ition, it &s;inks into &s;ilence, and no longer continues, an object of public con|cern.</P>
<P>The parliament being di&s;&s;olved, another was called by a very extraordinary proclamation. In this the king complained of the evil de|&s;igns of men di&s;affected to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and of their having mi&s;repre&s;ented his conduct and principles. He expre&s;&s;ed hopes, that his &s;ubjects would &s;end up to parliament the fitte&s;t per&s;ons to redre&s;s the pre&s;ent di&s;orders. He entreated that they would elect &s;uch in par|ticular, as had expre&s;&s;ed a firm attachment to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion when it was in dan|ger. It was thus that this monarch was tu|tored by the faction around him, to look with an evil eye on &s;ubjects that never oppo&s;ed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; &s;ubjects that dete&s;ted a popi&s;h mo|narch, and who&s;e only fault was the de&s;ire of being governed rather by the authority of a king, than a junto of their fellow-&s;ubjects who a&s;&s;umed his power. In the election of this important parliament, uncommon vigour was exerted on both &s;ides; but by dint of the mo|nied intere&s;t that prevailed in corporations, and
<PB N="201" REF="203">
the activity of the mini&s;try, which will always have weight, a great majority of Whigs was returned both in England and Scotland.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t meeting of this new parlia|ment, in which the Whigs, with the king at their head, for he took no care to conceal his partialities, were predominant, nothing was expected but the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures again&s;t the late mini&s;try, nor were the expectations of mankind di&s;appointed. The king gave the hou&s;e of commons to under&s;tand, that the branches of the revenue, appointed for the &s;upport of the civil government, were not &s;uf|ficient for that purpo&s;e. He warned them, that the pretender boa&s;ted of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he expected in England to repair his former di&s;|appointments. He intimated al&s;o, that he ex|pected their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in puni&s;hing &s;uch as en|deavoured to deprive him of that ble&s;&s;ing he mo&s;t valued, the affection of his people. As the hou&s;es were pre-di&s;po&s;ed to violent mea|&s;ures, this &s;erved to give them the alarm; and they out-went even the mo&s;t &s;anguine expecta|tions of the mo&s;t vindictive mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The lords, in return to the &s;peech, profe&s;&s;ed their hopes that the king would be able to re|cover the reputation of the kingdom on the continent, the lo&s;s of which they affected to
<PB N="202" REF="204">
deplore. The commons went much farther: they declared their re&s;olution to trace out tho&s;e mea&s;ures by which the country was depre&s;&s;ed: they re&s;olved to &s;eek after tho&s;e abettors on whom the pretender &s;eemed to ground his hopes; and they determined to bring &s;uch to condign puni&s;hment. Mr. &s;ecretary Stan|hope openly a&s;&s;erted, that notwith&s;tanding the endeavours which had been u&s;ed by the late mini&s;try to prevent a di&s;covery of their hidden tran&s;actions, by conveying away &s;everal papers from the &s;ecretary's office, yet there was &s;till &s;ufficient evidence left to prove their corruptions and trea&s;ons. He added, that the&s;e proofs would &s;oon be laid before the hou&s;e, when it would appear that the duke of Ormond had acted in concert, if not received orders from the French general.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e &s;eemed very well inclined to en|ter into any impeachment; and there was no re&s;traint to the violence of their mea&s;ures, but the voice of a multitude without doors, intimidated by the re&s;olution of the pre&s;ent rulers. It was the artifice, during this and the &s;ucceeding reign, to &s;tigmatize all tho&s;e who te&s;tified their di&s;content again&s;t government, as Papi&s;ts and Jacobites. All who ventured to &s;peak again&s;t the violence of their mea|&s;ures,
<PB N="203" REF="205">
were reproached as de&s;igning to bring in the pretender; and mo&s;t people were con&s;e|quently afraid to murmur, &s;ince di&s;content was &s;o near a-kin to trea&s;on. The people, therefore, beheld the violence of their con|duct in &s;ilent fright, internally di&s;approving, yet not daring to avow their dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>In this ferment, the former mini&s;try could expect neither ju&s;tice nor mercy. A part of them kept away from bu&s;ine&s;s, Bolingbroke had hitherto appeared and &s;poke in the hou&s;e as u&s;ual. However, his fears now prevailed over his de&s;ire to vindicate his character; find|ing an impeachment was likely to be made, he withdrew to the continent, leaving a letter, in which he declared, that if there had been any hopes of a fair and open trial, he would not have declined it; but being already pre|judged in the minds of the majority, he thought fit, by flight, to con&s;ult their honour and his own &s;afety.</P>
<P>A committee was &s;oon after appointed, con|&s;i&s;ting of twenty per&s;ons, to in&s;pect all the pa|pers relative to the late negociation for peace; and to pick out &s;uch of them as might &s;erve as &s;ubjects of accu&s;ation again&s;t the late mini&s;try. After &s;ome time &s;pent in this di&s;qui&s;ition, Mr. Walpole, as chairman of the committee, de|clared
<PB N="204" REF="206">
to the hou&s;e that a report was drawn up; and in the mean time, moved that a war|rant might be i&s;&s;ued for apprehending Mr. Matthew Prior, and Mr. Thomas Harley, who, being in the hou&s;e, were immediately taken into cu&s;tody. Then he read the report of the committee, in which a number of charges were drawn out again&s;t the queen's mini&s;ters. The clande&s;tine negociation with Mr. Menager; the extraordinary mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to form the congre&s;s at Utrecht; the trifling of the French plenipotentiaries by the connivance of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters; the duke of Ormond's acting in concert with the French general; Bolingbroke's journey to France to negociate a &s;eperate peace; the&s;e and &s;ome other charges were recited again&s;t them, and then Walpole impeached lord Bolingbroke of high trea&s;on. This &s;truck &s;ome of the members with amaze|ment, as there was nothing in the report that any way amounted to trea&s;on; but they were &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed, when lord Coning&s;by, ri&s;ing up, was heard to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The worthy chairmain has impeached the hand, but I im|peach the head; he has impeached the &s;cholar, and I the ma&s;ter. I impeach Robert earl of Oxford, and earl of Mortimer, of high trea&s;on, and other crimes and mi&s;demea|nors."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="207">When lord Oxford appeared in the hou&s;e of lords the day following, he was avoided by the peers as infectious; and he had now an opportunity of di&s;covering the ba&s;ene&s;s of mankind. When the articles were read again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of commons, a warm de|bate aro&s;e upon that in which he was charged with having advi&s;ed the French king of the manner of gaining Tournay from the Dutch. Mr. Walpole alledged that it was trea&s;on. Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, a known Whig, &s;aid that he could never be of opinion that it amounted to trea&s;on. It was his principle, he &s;aid, to do ju&s;tice to all men, to the highe&s;t and the low|e&s;t. He hoped he might pretend to &s;ome knowlege of the laws, and would not &s;cruple to declare upon this part of the que&s;tion in favour of the criminal. To this Walpole an|&s;wered, with great warmth, that there were &s;everal per&s;ons both in and out of the com|mittee, who did not in the lea&s;t yield to that member in point of hone&s;ty, and exceeded him in the knowlege of the laws, and yet were &s;atisfied that the charge in that article amounted to high trea&s;on. This point being decided again&s;t the earl, and the other articles approved by the hou&s;e, the lord Coning&s;by, attended by the Whig members, impeached
<PB N="206" REF="208">
the lord Oxford at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, demanding, at the &s;ame time, that he might lo&s;e his &s;eat, and be committed to cu&s;|tody. When this point came to be debated in the hou&s;e of lords a violent altercation en|&s;ued. Tho&s;e who &s;till adhered to the depo&s;ed min&s;ter maintained the inju&s;tice and the dan|ger of &s;uch a proceeding. At la&s;t the earl him&s;elf ro&s;e up, and, with great tranquillity, &s;poke to the following purpo&s;e. After ob|&s;erving that the whole charge might be reduced to the negociation for, and the conclu&s;ion of the peace,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am accu&s;ed, &s;ays he, for having made a peace; a peace, which, bad as it is now repre&s;ented, has been approved by two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parliaments. For my own part, I always acted by the immediate di|rections and command of the queen my mi&s;tre&s;s, and never offended again&s;t any known law. I am ju&s;tified in my own con|&s;cience, and unconcerned for the life of an in&s;ignificant old man. But I cannot, with|out the highe&s;t ingratitude, remain uncon|cerned for the be&s;t of queens; obligation binds me to vindicate her memory. My lords, if mini&s;ters of &s;tate, acting by the immediate commands of their &s;overeign, are afterwards to be made accountable for their
<PB N="207" REF="209">
proceedings, it may one day or other be the ca&s;e of all the members of this augu&s;t a&s;|&s;embly. I doubt not, therefore, that out of regard to your&s;elves, your lord&s;hips will give me an equitable hearing; and I hope, that in the pro&s;ecution of this enquiry, it will appear, that I have merited not only the indulgence, but the favour of this go|vernment. My lords, I am now to take my leave of your lord&s;hips, and of this ho|nourable hou&s;e, perhaps, for ever. I &s;hall lay down my life with plea&s;ure, in a cau&s;e favoured by my late dear royal mi&s;tre&s;s. And when I con&s;ider that I am to be judged by the ju&s;tice, honour, and virtue of my peers, I &s;hall acquie&s;ce, and retire with great content. And, my lords, God's will be done."</Q></P>
<P>On his return from the hou&s;e of lords to his own hou&s;e, where he was for that night per|mitted to go, he was followed by a great mul|titude of people, crying out,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"High church, Ormond, and Oxford for ever."</Q>
Next day he was brought to the bar, where he received a copy of his impeachment, and was allowed a month to prepare his an&s;wer. Though doctor Mead declared that if the earl &s;hould be &s;ent to the Tower, his life would be in danger, it was
<PB N="208" REF="210">
carried in the hou&s;e that he &s;hould be com|mitted. The ferment in the hou&s;e &s;till conti|nued; the earl of Angle&s;ey declared that &s;uch violent mea&s;ures would make the &s;ceptre &s;hake in the king's hands. This encrea&s;ed the tu|mult; and though much greater liberties have been &s;ince taken by that party again&s;t their &s;overeign, yet Angle&s;ey was then obliged to apologize for this expre&s;&s;ion. Oxford was at|tended in his way to the Tower by a prodi|gious concour&s;e of people, who vented their anger at his commitment in imprecations upon his pro&s;ecutors.</P>
<P>The violence of the commons was an&s;wered with equal violence without doors. Tumults became every day more frequent, and every tumult only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the &s;everity of the legi&s;lature. They now pa&s;&s;ed an act, de|claring, that if any per&s;ons, to the number of twelve, unlawfully a&s;&s;embled, &s;hould continue together one hour after being required to di&s;|per&s;e by a ju&s;tice of peace, or other officer, and after hearing the act again&s;t riots read in public, they &s;hould be deemed guilty of fe|lony, without benefit of clergy. This is a very &s;evere act, and one of the greate&s;t re|&s;trictions on the liberty of the &s;ubject that pa&s;&s;ed during this century. By this, all meet|ings of the people, either for the purpo&s;es of
<PB N="209" REF="211">
amu&s;ement or redre&s;s, are rendered criminal, if it &s;hall plea&s;e any magi&s;trate to con&s;ider them as &s;uch. It is, indeed, very remark|able, that all the &s;evere and mo&s;t re&s;trictive laws were enacted by that party that are continually &s;tunning mankind with a cry of freedom.</P>
<P>At the time appointed, Oxford's an&s;wer to the charges exhibited again&s;t him was deli|vered into the hou&s;e of lords, from whence it was tran&s;mitted to the hou&s;e of commons. Walpole having heard it read, declared that it contained little more than a repetition of the pamphlets in vindication of the late mini&s;try, and that it maliciou&s;ly laid upon the queen the blame of all the pernicious mea&s;ures he had led her into. He alledged, that it was al&s;o a libel on the proceedings of the hou&s;e, &s;ince he endeavoured to clear tho&s;e per&s;ons who had already confe&s;&s;ed their guilt by flight. In con|&s;equence of this a committee was appointed to manage his impeachment, and to prepare evi|dence again&s;t him. By this committee it was reported, that Mr. Prior had gro&s;ly prevari|cated on his examination, and behaved with great contempt of their authority. The duke of Ormond and lord Bolingbroke having omitted to &s;urrender them&s;elves within a li|mited
<PB N="210" REF="212">
time, it was ordered that the earl mar|&s;hal &s;hould raze out their names and arms from among the li&s;t of peers, and inventories were taken of their e&s;tates and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which were declared forfeited to the crown. In this manner an indi&s;criminate vengeance &s;eemed to pur&s;ue the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the late mini&s;try, and who concluded a more beneficial treaty of peace than England ever obtained either before or &s;ince.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e proceedings lord Oxford was confined in the Tower, where he continued for two years, during which time the nation was in a continual ferment from an actual rebellion that was carried on un|&s;ucce&s;sfully. After the execution of &s;ome lords, who were taken in arms, the nation &s;eemed glutted with blood, and that was the time that lord Oxford petitioned to be brought to his trial. He knew that the fury of the nation was &s;pent on objects that were really culpable, and expected that his ca&s;e would look like innocence it&s;elf, when compared to theirs.<MILESTONE N="1717" UNIT="A.D."> A day, therefore, at his own reque&s;t was a&s;&s;igned him, and the commons were or|dered to prepare for their charge. At the ap|pointed time the peers repaired to the court in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, where lord Cowper pre|&s;ided
<PB N="211" REF="213">
as lord high-&s;teward. The king, and the re&s;t of the royal family, with the foreign mini&s;ters, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;olemnity. The earl was conducted from the Tower; the articles of his impeachment read, with his an&s;wers, and the reply of the commons. As Sir Jo|&s;eph Jekyl &s;tood up to make good the fir&s;t ar|ticle of the charge, which amounted only to a mi&s;demeanor, lord Harcourt repre&s;ented to the lords that it would be tedious and unne|ce&s;&s;ary to go through the whole of the charges alledged again&s;t the earl; that if tho&s;e only were proved, in which he was impeached of high trea&s;on, the earl would then forfeit his life and e&s;tate, and there would be an end of the matter. He was, therefore, of opinion, that the commons &s;hould not be admitted to pro|ceed upon the more unimportant part of the accu&s;ation, until judgment &s;hould be fir&s;t ob|tained upon the articles for high-trea&s;on. In this the lords agreeing, the commons declared that it was their undoubted privilege to im|peach a peer either for trea&s;on, or a mi&s;de|meanor, or to mix the accu&s;ation as they thought proper. The lords a&s;&s;erted that it was a right inherent in every court of ju&s;tice to direct the methods of proceeding in that court. The commons demanded a conference; but this
<PB N="212" REF="214">
was refu&s;ed. The di&s;pute grew warm; the lords informed the lower hou&s;e by me&s;&s;age that they would proceed to the trial; the com|mons di&s;regarded the information, and refu&s;ed to attend. Soon after the lords repairing to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and commanding the earl to be brought forth, his accu&s;ers were ordered to appear. But finding the commons re&s;olute, having waited a quarter of an hour, it was voted that the pri&s;oner &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. To this di&s;pute he probably owed the &s;ecurity of his title and fortune; for as to the articles, importing him guilty of high trea&s;on, they were at once malignant and frivolous; &s;o that his life was in no manner of danger.</P>
<P>The duke of Ormond, as has been mention|ed, was accu&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; and it is thought that his corre&s;pondence with the pretender was better a&s;certained than his ac|cu&s;ers at fir&s;t thought proper to declare. How|ever, Mr. Hutche&s;on, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of trade, boldly &s;poke in his defence. He ex|patiated on his noble birth and qualifications; he enumerated the &s;ervices he had performed to the crown; he a&s;&s;erted that the duke had only obeyed the queen's commands, and affirm|ed that all the allegations again&s;t him could not, in rigour of the law, be con&s;trued into

high trea&s;on. His flight was a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the&s;e arguments; having refu&s;ed to defend his innocence, his oppo&s;ers were re&s;olved to condemn him as guilty. The night he took leave of England, it is &s;aid he paid a vi&s;it to lord Oxford, who di&s;&s;uaded him from flying with as much earne&s;tne&s;s, as the duke entreat|ed Oxford to fly. He bid his friend the la&s;t adieu, with the&s;e words,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Farewell Oxford, without an head."</Q>
To which the other replied, <Q REND="inline">"Farewell duke, without a duchy."</Q> He afterwards continued to re&s;ide chiefly in Spain, an illu&s;trious exile, and fruitle&s;sly at|tached to a ma&s;ter unworthy of his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The commons were not le&s;s determined again&s;t lord Strafford, again&s;t whom articles of impeachment were voted. However, he was afterwards included with others in an act of indemnity, and found &s;afety among the num|ber that were driven into guilt, and then thought worthy of pardon.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the&s;e vindictive proceed|ings excited the indignation of the people, who perceived that the avenues to royal favour were clo&s;ed again&s;t all but a faction. The flames of rebellion were actually kindled in Scotland, where, to their other grievances, they joined that of the union, which they were
<PB N="214" REF="216">
taught to con&s;ider as an oppre&s;&s;ion. The malecontents of that country had all along maintained a corre&s;pondence with their friends in England, who were now driven by re&s;ent|ment and apprehen&s;ion into a &s;y&s;tem of politics they would not otherwi&s;e had dreamt of. Some of the Tory party, who were men attached to the prote&s;tant religion, and of moderate princi|ples in government, began to a&s;&s;ociate with the Jacobites, and to wi&s;h in earne&s;t for a revolution. Scotland fir&s;t &s;hewed them an example. The earl of Mar a&s;&s;embling three hundred of his own va&s;&s;als in the Highlands, proclaimed the pretender at Ca&s;tletown, and &s;et up his &s;tandard at a place called Braemaer, a&s;&s;uming the title of lieutenant-general of his maje&s;ty's forces. To &s;econd the&s;e attempts, two ve&s;&s;els arrived in Scotland from France, with arms, ammuni|tion, and a number of officers, together with a&s;&s;urances to the earl, that the pretender him|&s;elf would &s;hortly come over to head his own forces. The earl, in con&s;equence of this pro|mi&s;e, &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of ten thou&s;and men, well armed and provided. He &s;ecured the pa&s;s of Tay at Perth, where his head quarters were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole fruitful province of Fife, and all the &s;ea coa&s;t on that &s;ide of the
<PB N="215" REF="217">
Frith of Edinburgh. He marched from thence to Dumblaine, as if he had intended to cro&s;s the Forth at Stirling bridge; but there he was informed of the preparations the duke of Argyle was making, who was rai&s;ing forces to give him battle.</P>
<P>This nobleman, who&s;e family had &s;uffered &s;o much under the Stuart line, was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of his hereditary hatred; and upon this oc|ca&s;ion he was appointed commander in chief of all the forces of North Britain. The earl of Sutherland al&s;o went down to Scotland to rai&s;e forces for the &s;ervice of government; and many other Scotti&s;h peers followed the example. The earl of Mar being informed that the duke was advancing again&s;t him from Stirling, with all his own clans, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome troops from Ireland, at fir&s;t thought it wi&s;e&s;t to retreat. But being &s;oon after joined by &s;ome of the clans under the earl of Seaforth, and others under general Gordon, an expe|rienced officer, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, he re&s;olved to face the enemy, and directed his march towards the South.</P>
<P>The duke of Argyle apprized of his inten|tions, and at any rate willing to prove his at|tachment to the pre&s;ent government, re&s;olved
<PB N="216" REF="218">
to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblain, though his forces did not amount to half the number of the enemy. In the morning, therefore, he drew up his army, which did not exceed three thou&s;and five hun|dred men, in order of battle; but he &s;oon found him&s;elf greatly out-flanked by the ene|my. The duke, therefore, perceiving the earl making attempts to &s;urround him, was obliged to alter his di&s;po&s;ition, which, on ac|count of the &s;carcity of general officers, was not done &s;o expeditiou&s;ly, as to be fini&s;hed be|fore the rebels began the attack. The left wing, therefore, of the duke's army received the center of the enemy, and &s;upported the fir&s;t charge without &s;hrinking. It &s;eemed even for a while victorious, as the earl of Clanronald who commanded again&s;t it, was killed on the &s;pot. But Glengary, who was &s;econd in command, undertook to in&s;pire his intimidated forces; and waving his bonnet, cried out &s;everal times, Revenge. This animated the rebel troops to &s;uch a degree, that they followed him clo&s;e to the points of the enemies bayonets, and got within their guard. A total rout began to en&s;ue of that wing of the royal army; and general Wetham, their commander, flying full &s;peed to Stirling, gave out that all was lo&s;t,
<PB N="217" REF="219">
and that the rebels were completely victorious. In the mean time, the duke of Argyle, who commanded in per&s;on on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, and drove them before him two miles, though they often faced about, and attempted to rally. Having thus entirely broken that wing, and driven them over the river Allen, he returned back to the field of battle, where, to his great mortification, he found the enemy victorious, and patiently waiting the a&s;&s;ault. However, in&s;tead of re|newing the engagement, both armies continued to gaze at each other, neither caring to begin the attack. At evening, both &s;ides drew off, and both &s;ides claimed the victory. Though the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field was kept by neither, yet certainly all the honour, and all the advan|tages of the day, belonged only to the duke of Argyle. It was &s;ufficient for him to have in|terrupted the progre&s;s of the enemy; for in their circum&s;tances, delay was defeat. In fact, the earl of Mar &s;oon found his di&s;appointments and his lo&s;&s;es encrea&s;e. The ca&s;tle of Inver|ne&s;s, of which he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was deli|vered up to the king by lord Lovat, who had hitherto profe&s;&s;ed to act in the intere&s;t of the pre|tender. The marquis of Tullibardine for&s;ook the earl, in order to defend his own part of the
<PB N="218" REF="220">
country; and many of the clans &s;eeing no like|lihood of coming &s;oon to a &s;econd engagement, returned quietly home; for an irregular army is much ea&s;ier led to battle, than induced to bear the fatigues of a campaign.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the rebellion was &s;till more un&s;ucce&s;sfully pro&s;ecuted in England. From the time the pretender had undertaken this wild project at Paris, in which the duke of Ormond and lord Bolingbroke were enga|ged, lord Stair, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador there, had penetrated all his de&s;igns, and &s;ent faithful accounts of all his mea&s;ures, and all his adhe|rents to the mini&s;try at home. Upon the fir&s;t rumour, therefore, of an in&s;urrection, they im|pri&s;oned &s;everal lords and gentlemen, of whom they had a &s;u&s;picion. The earls of Home, Wintown, and Kinnoul, and others, were com|mitted to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. The king obtained leave from the lower hou&s;e to &s;eize Sir William Wyndham, Sir John Pack|ington, Harvey, Combe, and others. The lords Land&s;down and Duplin were taken into cu&s;tody. Sir William Wyndham's father-in-law, the duke of Somer&s;et, offered to become bound for his appearance; but his &s;urety was refu&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">But all the&s;e precautions were not able to &s;top the in&s;urrection in the we&s;tern counties, where it was already begun. However all their preparations were weak and ill conducted, every mea&s;ure was betrayed to government as &s;oon as projected, and many revolts repre&s;&s;ed in the very out&s;et. The univer&s;ity of Oxford was treated with great &s;everity on this occa|&s;ion. Major general Pepper, with a &s;trong detachment of dragoons, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city at day break, declaring he would in&s;tantly &s;hoot any of the &s;tudents, who &s;hould pre&s;ume to appear without the limits of their re&s;pective colleges. The in&s;urrection in the Northern counties came to greater maturity.<MILESTONE N="1715" UNIT="A.D."> In the month of October, the earl of Derwentwater, and Mr. For&s;ter, took the field with a body of hor&s;e, and being joined by &s;ome gentlemen from the borders of Scotland, proclaimed the pretender. Their fir&s;t attempt was to &s;eize upon Newca&s;tle, in which they had many friends; but they found the gates &s;hut again&s;t them, and were obliged to retire to Hexham. To oppo&s;e the&s;e, general Carpenter was de|tached by government, with a body of nine hundred men, and an engagement was hourly expected. The rebels had two methods, by which they might have conducted them&s;elves
<PB N="220" REF="222">
with prudence. The one was to march di|rectly into the We&s;tern parts of Scotland, and there join general Gordon, who commanded a &s;trong body of Highlanders. The other was to cro&s;s the Tweed, and boldly attack general Carpenter, who&s;e forces did nor exceed their own. From the infatuation attendant on that party, neither of the&s;e mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued. They took the route to Jedburgh, where they hoped to leave Carpenter on one &s;ide, and penetrate into England by the we&s;tern border. This was the effectual means to cut them&s;elves off either from retreat or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A party of Highlanders, who had joined them by this time, at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to accompany them in this de&s;perate irruption, and one half of them ac|tually returned to their own country. At Brampton, Mr. Fo&s;ter opened his commi&s;&s;ion of general, which had been &s;ent him from the earl of Mar, and there he proclaimed the pre|tender. They continued their march to Pen|rith, where the body of the militia, that was a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e them, fled at their appear|ance. From Penrith, they proceeded, by the way of Kendal and Lanca&s;ter, to Pre&s;ton, of which place they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, without any re&s;i&s;t|ance. But this was the la&s;t &s;tage of their ill advi&s;ed incur&s;ion; for general Wills, at the
<PB N="221" REF="223">
head of &s;even thou&s;and men, came up to the town to attack them; and from his activity there was no e&s;caping. They now, therefore, began to rai&s;e barricadoes, and to put the place in a po&s;ture of defence, repul&s;ing the fir&s;t at|tack of the royal army with &s;ucce&s;s. Next day, however, Wills was reinforced by Carpenter, and the town was inve&s;ted on all &s;ides. In this deplorable &s;ituation, to which they were reduced by their own ra&s;hne&s;s, Fo&s;ter hoped to capitulate with the general, and accordingly &s;ent colonel Oxburgh, who had been taken pri&s;oner, with a trumpeter to propo&s;e a capi|tulation. This, however, Wills refu&s;ed, al|ledging, that he would not treat with rebels, and that the only favour they had to expect, was to be &s;pared from immediate &s;laughter. The&s;e were hard terms, but no better could be obtained. They accordingly laid down their arms, and were put under a &s;trong guard; all the noblemen and leaders were &s;ecured, and a few of their officers tried for de&s;erting from the royal army, and &s;hot by order of a court-martial. The common men were im|pri&s;oned at Che&s;ter and Liverpool; the noble|men and con&s;iderable officers were &s;ent to London, and led through the &s;treets, pinioned and bound together, to intimidate their party.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="224">Such was the &s;ucce&s;s of two expeditions &s;et on foot in favour of the pretender, in neither of which appears the &s;malle&s;t traces of conduct or de&s;ign. But the conduct of his party on this &s;ide the water, was wi&s;dom it&s;elf, compar|ed to that with which it was managed at Paris. Bolingbroke there had been made his &s;ecreta|ry, and Ormond his prime mini&s;ter. But the&s;e &s;tate&s;men quickly found that nothing could be done in favour of his cau&s;e. The king of France, who had ever e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of the abdicated family, was ju&s;t dead; and the duke of Orleans, who &s;ucceeded in the government of the kingdom, was aver&s;e to lending the pretender any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. His par|ty, however, which was compo&s;ed of the lowe&s;t, and the mo&s;t ignorant exiles from the Briti&s;h dominions, affected the utmo&s;t confidence, and boa&s;ted of a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. The deepe&s;t &s;ecrets of his cabinet, and all his intend|ed mea&s;ures, were bandied about in coffee-hou&s;es by per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t rank, both in fortune and abilities. Subaltern officers re|&s;olved to be his generals; and even pro&s;titutes were entru&s;ted to manage his negociations. Little, therefore, could be expected from &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and &s;uch councils.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225">He might by this time have been convinced of the vanity of his expectations, in &s;uppo&s;ing that the whole country would ri&s;e up in his cau&s;e. His affairs were actually de&s;perate; yet, with his u&s;ual infatuation, he re&s;olved to hazard his per&s;on among his friends in Scot|land, at a time when &s;uch a mea&s;ure was too late for &s;ucce&s;s. Pa&s;&s;ing, therefore, through France in di&s;gui&s;e, and embarking in a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el at Dunkirk, he arrived after a voyage of a few days on the coa&s;ts of Scotland, with only &s;ix gentlemen in his train. He pa&s;&s;ed unknown through Aberdeen to Fetero&s;&s;e, where he was met by the earl of Mar, and about thirty noblemen and gentlemen of the fir&s;t quality. There he was &s;olemnly proclaimed. His declaration, dated at Commercy, was print|ed and di&s;per&s;ed. He went from thence to Dundee, where he made a public entry, and in two days more he arrived at Scoon, where he intended to have the ceremony of his coro|nation performed. He ordered thank&s;givings to be made for his &s;afe arrival; he enjoined the mini&s;ters to pray for him in their churches; and, without the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of power, went through the ceremonies of royalty, which threw an air of ridicule on all his conduct. Having thus &s;pent &s;ome time in unimportant
<PB N="224" REF="226">
parade, he re&s;olved to abandon the enterprize with the &s;ame levity with which it was under|taken. Having made a &s;peech to his grand council, he informed them of his want of money, arms, and ammunition, for undertaking a campaign, and therefore deplored that he was compelled to leave them. He once more embark|ed on board a &s;mall French &s;hip that lay in the harbour of Montro&s;e, accompanied with &s;everal lords, his adherents, and in five days arrived at Graveline.</P>
<P>General Gordon, who was left commander in chief of the forces, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the earl Mare&s;chal, proceeded at their head to Aber|deen, where he &s;ecured three ve&s;&s;els to &s;ail Northward, which took on board &s;uch per&s;ons as intended to make their e&s;cape to the conti|nent. He then continued his march through the Highlands, and quietly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his forces as he went forward. This retreat was made with &s;uch expedition, that the duke of Argyle, with all his activity, could never overtake his rear, which con&s;i&s;ted of a thou&s;and hor&s;e.</P>
<P>In this manner ended a rebellion, which nothing but imbecillity could project, and no|thing but ra&s;hne&s;s &s;upport. But though the enemy was now no more, the fury of the victors did not &s;eem in the lea&s;t to abate with
<PB N="225" REF="227">
&s;ucce&s;s. The law was now put in force with all its terrors; and the pri&s;ons of London were crowded with tho&s;e deluded wretches, whom the mini&s;try &s;eemed re&s;olved not to pardon. The commons, in their addre&s;s to the crown, declared they would pro&s;ecute, in the mo&s;t ri|gorous manner, the authors of the late rebel|lion, that their re&s;olutions were as &s;peedy, as their mea&s;ures were vindictive. The earls of Derwentwater, Nithi&s;dale, Carnwarth, and Wintown, the lords Widrington, Kenmuir, and Nairne were impeached, and upon plead|ing guilty, all but lord Wintown, receiv|ed &s;entence of death. No entreaties could &s;often the mini&s;try to &s;pare the&s;e unhappy men. The hou&s;e of lords even pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the throne for mercy, but without effect; the king only an&s;wered, that on this, and all other occa&s;ions, he would act as he thought mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the crown, and the &s;afety of his people.</P>
<P>Orders were accordingly di&s;patched for exe|cuting the lords Derwentwater, Nithi&s;dale, and Kenmuir immediately; the re&s;t were re&s;pited to a farther time. Nithi&s;dale, however, had the good fortune to e&s;cape in woman's cloaths, which were brought him by his mother the night before his execution. Derwentwater
<PB N="226" REF="228">
and Kenmuir were brought to the &s;caffold on Tower-hill at the time appointed. Both un|derwent their &s;entence with calm intrepidity, pitied by all, and &s;eemingly le&s;s moved them&s;elves than tho&s;e who beheld them. Der|wentwater was particularly regretted, as he was generous, ho&s;pitable, and humane. His fortune being large, he gave bread to multi|tudes of the poor, by whom he was con&s;idered as a parent and a protector.</P>
<P>To &s;econd the&s;e vindictive efforts, an act of parliament was made for trying the private pri&s;oners in London, and not in Lanca&s;hire, where they were taken in arms. This pro|ceeding was con&s;idered, by &s;ome of the be&s;t lawyers, as an alteration of the ancient con&s;ti|tution of the kingdom, by which it was con|firmed, that every pri&s;oner &s;hould be tried in the place where the offence was committed. In the beginning of April, commi&s;&s;ioners for trying the rebels met in the court of common pleas, when the bills were found again&s;t Mr. For&s;ter, Mr. Mackinto&s;h, and twenty of their confederates.</P>
<P>For&s;ter e&s;caped from Newgate, and reach|ed the continent in &s;afety, the re&s;t plead|ed not guilty. Pitts, the keeper of New|gate, being &s;u&s;pected of having connived at For&s;ter's e&s;cape, was tried for his life, but ac|quitted.
<PB N="227" REF="229">
Yet notwith&s;tanding this, Mackin|to&s;h and &s;everal other pri&s;oners, broke from Newgate, after having ma&s;tered the keeper and turnkey, and di&s;armed the centinel. The court proceeded to the trial of tho&s;e that re|mained; four or five were hanged, drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn. Among the&s;e, Wil|liam Paul, a clergyman, attracted peculiar pity: he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a true and &s;incere member of the church of England, but not of that &s;ci&s;matical church, who&s;e bi&s;hops had abandoned their king, and &s;hamefully given up their eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges. How &s;trong &s;oever the taint of faction may be in any man's bo&s;om, if he has any goodne&s;s in him, he can|not help feeling the &s;tronge&s;t pity for tho&s;e brave men who are willing, however erroneou&s;ly, to &s;acrifice their lives to their principles. The judges appointed to try the rebels at Liver|pool, found a con&s;iderable number guilty of high trea&s;on. Two and twenty were executed at Pre&s;ton and Manche&s;ter; about a thou&s;and pri&s;oners experienced the king's mercy, if &s;uch it may be called, to be tran&s;ported to North America.</P>
<P>Such was the end of a rebellion, probably at fir&s;t ha&s;tened forward by the rigour of the new Whig mini&s;try and parliament. In run|ing
<PB N="228" REF="230">
through the revolutions of human tran&s;|actions, it is a melancholy con&s;ideration that in all contentions, we generally find little to applaud on either &s;ide. We here &s;ee a weak and imprudent party, endeavouring not only to &s;ubvert the government, but the religion of their country. We &s;ee a pretended mo|narch, bred a papi&s;t him&s;elf, and confiding in popi&s;h coun&s;ellors, profe&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to go|vern and protect the prote&s;tant religion.

Clemency in the government at that time, would probably have extingui&s;h|ed all that factious &s;pirit which has &s;ince con|tinued to di&s;turb public tranquility; for that mu&s;t be a wretched people indeed, that are more ea&s;ily driven than led into obedience to authority.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIV. GEORGE I. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>IN a con&s;titution &s;o very complicated as that of England, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer altera|tions from time; for &s;ome of its branches may gain &s;trength, while others become weaker. At this period, the orders placed between the king and the people, acquired more than their &s;hare of power. The king him&s;elf being a foreigner, and ignorant of the laws and con&s;ti|tution of the country, was kept under the con|troul of his mini&s;ters, who, by their private con|nexions, governed the parliament. At the &s;ame time, the people, awed by the fears of im|puted Jacobiti&s;m, were afraid to murmur, and were content to give up their freedom for &s;afe|ty. The rebellion now extingui&s;hed, only &s;erved to confirm the arrogance of tho&s;e in power. The parliament had &s;hewn it&s;elf eager to &s;econd the views of the mini&s;try; and the pretended danger of the &s;tate, was made a pre|text for continuing the parliament beyond the term fixed for its di&s;&s;olution. An act, there|fore,
<PB N="230" REF="232">
was made by their own authority, repeal|ing that by which they were to be di&s;&s;olved every third year, and the term of the duration was extended to &s;even years. This attempt, in any delegated body of people, to encrea&s;e their own power by extending it, is contrary to the fir&s;t principles of ju&s;tice. If it was right to extend their duration to &s;even years, they might al&s;o perpetuate their authority; and thus cut off even the &s;hadow of nomination. This bill, however, pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and all objections to it were con&s;idered as di&s;affec|tion. The people might murmur at this en|croachment, but it was too late for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic concerns being adju&s;ted, the king began to turn his thoughts to his Hanoverian dominions, and re&s;olved upon a voyage to the continent. He fore&s;aw a &s;torm gathering from Sweden. As Charles the twelfth, the extra|ordinary monarch of that country, was highly provoked again&s;t him for having entered into a confederacy with the Ru&s;&s;ians and Danes in his ab&s;ence, and for having purcha&s;ed the towns of Bremen and Verden from the king of Den|mark, which con&s;tituted a part of his domi|nions. George, therefore, having pa&s;&s;ed thro' Holland to Hanover, in order to &s;ecure his German dominions, entered into a new treaty
<PB N="231" REF="233">
with the Dutch and the regent of France; by which they agreed mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nor were his fears from Sweden without foundation, Charles maintained a clo&s;e corre&s;|pondence with the di&s;affected &s;ubjects of Great Britain; and a &s;cheme was formed for the landing a con&s;iderable body of Swedi&s;h forces, with the king at their head, in &s;ome part of the i&s;land, where it was expected they would be joined by all the malecontents in the king|dom. Count Gyllenburg, the Swedi&s;h mi|ni&s;ter in London, was peculiarly active in the con&s;piracy; but being &s;eized with all his pa|pers, by order of the king, the confederacy was broke for this time. However, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed by the commons, prohibiting all com|merce with Sweden, the trade with which country was of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the Engli&s;h merchants. A &s;upply of two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds was granted the king, to enable him to &s;ecure his dominions again&s;t the threatened inva&s;ion. The&s;e were the fir&s;t fruits of England's being wedded to the continent; however, the death of the Swedi&s;h monarch, who &s;oon after was killed by a cannon-ball at the &s;iege of Frederic&s;hall in Norway, put an end to all di&s;quietude from that quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="234">But this was the age of treaties, &s;ub&s;idies, and political combinations. At that time the politicians of the age, &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch paper chains would be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the per|manence of dominion, but experience has &s;uf|ficiently taught the contrary. Among other treaties concluded with &s;uch hopes, was that called the Quadruple Alliance. It was agreed upon between the emperor, France, England, and Holland, that the emperor &s;hould re|nounce all preten&s;ions to the crown of Spain, and exchange Sardinia for Sicily with the duke of Savoy; that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the dutchies of Tu&s;cany, Parma, and Placentia, &s;hould be &s;ettled on the queen of Spain's elde&s;t &s;on, in ca&s;e the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hould die without male i&s;&s;ue. However, this treaty was by no means agreeable to the king of Spain, and con&s;equently it became prejudicial to the Eng|li&s;h, as it interrupted the commerce to that kingdom. But the intere&s;t of England was not the object which this treaty was intended to &s;ecure.</P>
<P>The di&s;plea&s;ure of the king of Spain &s;oon broke out into open war again&s;t the emperor, whom he con&s;idered as the chief contriver of this alliance; and a numerous body of Spani&s;h troops were &s;ent into Italy to &s;upport Philip's
<PB N="233" REF="235">
preten&s;ions in that quarter. It was in vain that the regent of France attempted to di&s;|&s;uade him, in vain the king of England offer|ed his mediation, their interpo&s;ition was re|jected as partial and unju&s;t. War, in the pre|&s;ent exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the Engli&s;h finances, was a real evil; but a rupture with Spain was re|&s;olved on in order to &s;upport a very di&s;tant intere&s;t. A &s;trong &s;quadron of twenty-two &s;hips was equipped with all expedition, the command of which was given to Sir George Byng, and ordered to &s;ail for Naples, which was then threatened by the Spani&s;h army. He was received with the greate&s;t demon&s;tra|tions of joy by the inhabitants of that city, and was informed that the Spaniards, to the amount of thirty thou&s;and men, were then actually landed in Sicily. In this exigence, as no a&s;|&s;i&s;tance could be given by land, he re&s;olved to &s;ail thither, fully determined to pur&s;ue the Spani&s;h fleet on which they had embarked. Upon coming round Cape Faro, he perceived two &s;mall Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and pur&s;uing them clo&s;ely, they led him to their main fleet, which before noon he di&s;covered in line of battle, amounting, in all, to twenty-&s;even &s;ail. How|ever, the Spani&s;h fleet, upon perceiving the force of the Engli&s;h, attempted to &s;ail away,
<PB N="234" REF="236">
though &s;uperior in number. The Engli&s;h had for &s;ome time acquired &s;uch expertne&s;s in naval affairs, that no other nation would attempt to face them, but with manife&s;t advantage. The Spaniards &s;eemed di&s;tracted in their councils, and acted with extreme confu&s;ion. They made a running fight, and the commanders behaved with courage and activity, in &s;pite of which they were all taken except three, which were pre&s;erved by the conduct of one Cam|moc, their vice admiral, a native of Ireland. Sir George Byng behaved on this occa&s;ion with equal prudence and re&s;olution, and the king wrote him a letter, with his own hand, ap|proving his conduct. This victory, nece&s;&s;ari|ly produced the re&s;entment and complaints of the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters in all the courts of Eu|rope; and ha&s;tened the declaration of war upon the part of the Engli&s;h, which had been hitherto delayed.</P>
<P>This rupture with Spain, &s;erved once more to rai&s;e the declining expectations of the pre|tender and his adherents. It was hoped that, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cardinal Alberoni, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter, a new in&s;urrection might be excited in England. The duke of Ormond was the per&s;on fixed upon to conduct this ex|pedition; and he obtained from the Spani&s;h
<PB N="235" REF="237">
court a fleet of ten &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports, having on board &s;ix thou&s;and regular troops, with arms for twelve thou&s;and more. But fortune was &s;till as unfavourable as ever. Having &s;et &s;ail, and proceeded as far as Cape Fini&s;terre, he was encountered by a violent &s;torm, which di&s;abled his fleet, and fru&s;trated the expedition. This misfortune, together with the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms in Sicily, and other parts of Europe, induced Philip to wi&s;h for peace; and he at la&s;t con&s;ented to &s;ign the quadruple alliance. This was at that time thought an immen&s;e acqui&s;ition, but England, though &s;he procured the ratification, had no &s;hare in the advantage of the treaty.</P>
<P>The king having thus given peace once more to Europe, returned from the continent to receive the addre&s;&s;es and congratulations of his parliament. From addre&s;&s;ing they pro|ceeded to an object of much greater import|ance; this was the &s;ecuring the dependency of the Iri&s;h parliament on that of Great Bri|tain. One Maurice Anne&s;ley had appealed to the hou&s;e of peers in England, from a decree made by the hou&s;e of peers in Ireland, and this decree was rever&s;ed. The Briti&s;h peers ordered the barons of the exchequer in Ire|land to put Mr. Anne&s;ley in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
<PB N="236" REF="238">
lands he had lo&s;t by the decree of the lords in that kingdom. The barons of the exchequer obeyed this order; and the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of peers pa&s;&s;ed a vote again&s;t them, as having attempted to dimini&s;h the ju&s;t privileges of the parlia|ment of Ireland; and at the &s;ame time or|dered the barons to be taken under the cu&s;tody of the black-rod. On the other hand, the hou&s;e of lords in England re&s;olved, that the barons of the exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage and fidelity, and addre&s;&s;ed the king to &s;ignify his approbation of their con|duct by &s;ome marks of his favour. To com|plete their intention a bill was prepared, by which the Iri&s;h hou&s;e of lords was deprived of all right of final juri&s;diction. This bill was oppo&s;ed in both hou&s;es; but particularly in that of the commons. It was there a&s;&s;erted by Mr. Pitt that it would only encrea&s;e the power of the Engli&s;h peers, who already were but too formidable. Mr. Hungerford demon|&s;trated, that the Iri&s;h lords had always ex|erted their power of finally deciding cau&s;es. Notwith&s;tanding all oppo&s;ition the bill was carried by a great majority, and &s;oon after re|ceived the royal a&s;&s;ent. The people of Ire|land were not at that time &s;o well acquainted with their rights and ju&s;t privileges as they
<PB N="237" REF="239">
are at pre&s;ent. Their lords then were mo&s;tly made up of men bred up in luxury and igno|rance; neither &s;pirited enough to make oppo|&s;ition, nor &s;kilful enough to conduct it. It is very extraordinary that this bill, which was a real grievance, produced no commotions in the kingdom of Ireland; and that the coin|age of half-pence by one Wood, in England, for the people of that country, which was no grievance, was attended with very great di&s;|turbances. The rea&s;on mu&s;t be, that the latter oppo&s;ition was conducted by a man of genius, and the former impo&s;ition &s;ubmitted to by men of weak abilities.</P>
<P>But this blow, which was felt &s;everely by the Iri&s;h, was by no means &s;o great as that felt by the Engli&s;h at this time, from that &s;pi|rit of &s;cheming avarice, which had infected all ranks of people. It was but in the preceding year that one John Law, a Scotchman,<MILESTONE N="1721" UNIT="A.D."> had cheated France, by erecting a company under the name of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, which promi&s;ed that deluded people great wealth; but which ended in involving the French nation in great di&s;tre&s;s. It was now that the people of England were deceived by a project entirely &s;imilar, which is remembered by the name of the South-&s;ea Scheme, and which was felt long after by
<PB N="238" REF="240">
thou&s;ands. To explain this as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, it is to be ob&s;erved, that ever &s;ince the Revolution under king William, the go|vernment not having &s;ufficient &s;upplies granted by parliament, or what was granted requiring time to be collected, they were obliged to bor|row money from &s;everal different companies of merchants; and, among the re&s;t, from that company which traded to the South-&s;ea. In the year 1716 the government was indebted to this company about nine millions and an half of money, for which they granted at the rate of &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t. As this company was not the only one to which the govern|ment was indebted, and paid &s;uch large yearly intere&s;t, Sir Robert Walpole conceived a de|&s;ign of le&s;&s;ening the&s;e national debts, by giv|ing the &s;everal companies an alternative either of accepting a lower intere&s;t, namely, five per cent. or of being paid the principal. The different companies cho&s;e rather to accept of the dimini&s;hed intere&s;t, than to be paid the principal. The South-&s;ea company in parti|cular having made up their debt to the go|vernment, ten millions; in&s;tead of &s;ix hun|dred thou&s;and pounds, which they u&s;ually re|ceived as intere&s;t, were &s;atisfied with five hun|dred thou&s;and. In the &s;ame manner the go|vernors
<PB N="239" REF="241">
and company of the bank, and other companies, were contented to receive a dimi|ni&s;hed annual intere&s;t for their re&s;pective loans, all which greatly le&s;&s;ened the debts of the nation.</P>
<P>It was in this &s;ituation of things that one Blount, who had been bred a &s;crivener, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the cunning and plau&s;i|bility requi&s;ite for &s;uch an undertaking, pro|po&s;ed to the mini&s;try, in the name of the South-&s;ea company, to buy up all the debts of the different companies, and thus to become the &s;ole creditor of the &s;tate. The terms he offered to government were extremely advan|tageous. The South-&s;ea company was to re|deem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors, who were creditors to the government, upon whatever terms they could agree on; and for the intere&s;t of this money, which they had thus redeemed, and taken into their own hands, they would be contented to be allowed by government, for &s;ix years, five per cent. then the intere&s;t &s;hould be reduced to four per cent. and &s;hould at any time be redeemable by parliament. Thus far all was fair, and all was rea&s;onable. For the&s;e purpo&s;es a bill pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es; but now came the part of the &s;cheme big with fraud
<PB N="240" REF="242">
and ruin. As the directors of the South-&s;ea company could not of them&s;elves be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s money &s;ufficient to buy up the debts of the nation, they were empowered to rai&s;e it by opening a &s;ub&s;cription to a &s;cheme for trading in the South-&s;eas, from which com|merce immen&s;e advantages were promi&s;ed, and &s;till greater expected by the rapacious credu|lity of the people. All people, therefore, who were creditors to government, were in|vited to come in, and exchange their &s;ecuri|ties, namely, the government for the South-&s;ea company. Many were the advantages they were taught to expect from having their mo|ney traded with in a commerce to and from the &s;outhern parts of America, where it was reported that the Engli&s;h were to have a new &s;ettlement granted them by the king of Spain.</P>
<P>The directors books were no &s;ooner opened for the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cription, but crowds came to make the exchange of government &s;tock for South-&s;ea &s;tock. The delu&s;ion was artfully continued and &s;pread. Sub&s;criptions in a few days &s;old for double the price they had been bought at. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded beyond even the projectors hopes, and the whole na|tion was infected with a &s;pirit of avaricious enterprize. The infatuation prevailed; the
<PB N="241" REF="243">
&s;tock encrea&s;ed to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree, and to near ten times the value of what it was fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed for.</P>
<P>After a few months, however, the people waked from their dream of riches, and found that all the advantages they expected were merely imaginary, while thou&s;ands of families were involved in one common ruin. Many of the directors, by who&s;e arts the people were taught to expect &s;uch great benefits from a traffic to the South-&s;eas, had ama&s;&s;ed con&s;i|derable fortunes by the credulity of the pub|lic. It was one con&s;olation to the people to find the parliament &s;haring the general indig|nation, and re&s;olving to &s;trip tho&s;e plunderers of their unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Orders were fir&s;t given to remove all the directors of the South-&s;ea company from their &s;eats in parliament, and the places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under government.</P>
<P>The principal delinquents were puni&s;hed by a forfeiture of all &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and e&s;tates as they had acquired during the continuance of this popular frenzy. The next care was to redre&s;s the &s;ufferers. Several u&s;eful and ju&s;t re&s;olu|tions were taken by parliament, and a bill was &s;peedily prepared for repairing the late &s;uffer|ings, as far as the in&s;pection of the legi&s;lature could extend. Of the profits ari&s;ing from the
<PB N="242" REF="244">
South-&s;ea &s;cheme, the &s;um of &s;even millions was given back to the original proprietors; &s;everal additions were al&s;o made to their divi|dends, out of what was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the com|pany in their own right, and the remaining capital &s;tock was al&s;o divided among the old proprietors at the rate of thirty-three pounds per cent.</P>
<P>In the mean time petitions from all parts of the kingdom were pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e de|manding ju&s;tice, and the whole nation &s;eemed exa&s;perated to the highe&s;t degree. Public credit &s;u&s;tained a terrible &s;hock. Some prin|cipal members of the mini&s;try were deeply concerned in the&s;e fraudulent tran&s;actions. The bank was drawn upon fa&s;ter than it could &s;upply, and nothing was heard but the ravings of di&s;appointment and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The di&s;contents occa&s;ioned by the&s;e public calamities once more gave the di&s;affected party hopes of &s;ucceeding. But in all their coun|&s;els they were weak, divided, and wavering. The duke of Orleans, regent of France, is &s;aid to be the fir&s;t who gave the king informa|tion of a recent coin&s;pracy carried on by many per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, joined by &s;eve|ral malcontents of inferior quality. In con|&s;equence of this a camp was immediately
<PB N="243" REF="245">
formed in Hyde Park, and all military officers were ordered to repair to their re&s;pective &s;ta|tions. Lieutenant-general Macartney was di&s;|patched to Ireland to bring over troops from that kingdom, and the &s;tates of Holland were called upon to be ready with their guaranty. The people thus excited by new terrors, every day expected an inva&s;ion, and looked where the vengeance of government was likely to fall.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on who was &s;eized upon was Francis Atterbury, bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, a prelate long obnoxious to the pre&s;ent govern|ment, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of abilities to render him formidable to any mini&s;try he oppo&s;ed. His papers were &s;eized, and he him&s;elf confined to the Tower. Soon after the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Orrery, the lord North and Grey, and &s;ome others of inferior rank, were ar|re&s;ted and impri&s;oned. Of all the&s;e, how|ever, only the bi&s;hop, and one Mr. Layer, a barri&s;ter, felt the &s;everity of government, the proofs again&s;t the re&s;t amounting to no con|victive evidence.</P>
<P>A bill was brought into the hou&s;e of com|mons, impeaching bi&s;hop Atterbury, although he pleaded privilege as a peer. Though this met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition in that hou&s;e, yet it
<PB N="244" REF="246">
was re&s;olved by a great majority in the hou&s;e of commons that he &s;hould be deprived of his dig|nity and benefice, and &s;hould be bani&s;hed the kingdom for ever. The bi&s;hop made no defence in the lower hou&s;e, re&s;erving all his force, which he intended to exert in the hou&s;e of lords.</P>
<P>In that hou&s;e his cau&s;e had many friends; and his own eloquence, politene&s;s, and ingenu|ity, procured him many more. His cau&s;e coming before that a&s;&s;embly, a long and warm debate en&s;ued, in which the conte&s;t was more equally managed than the mini&s;try expected. As there was little or no proof again&s;t him, but what aro&s;e from intercepted letters, which were written in cyphers, the earl of Pawlet in|&s;i&s;ted that &s;uch could not be con&s;trued into trea&s;on or offence. The duke of Wharton having &s;ummed up the depo&s;itions, and &s;hewn the in&s;ufficiency of them, concluded with &s;aying, that let the con&s;equences be what they would, he hoped the lu&s;tre of that hou&s;e would never be tarni&s;hed by condemning a man without evidence. Lord Bathur&s;t al&s;o &s;poke in the bi&s;hop's favour, ob&s;erving, that if &s;uch extraordinary proceedings were coun|tenanced, he &s;aw nothing remaining for him and others, but to retire to their country hou&s;es, and there, if po&s;&s;ible, quietly to enjoy
<PB N="245" REF="247">
their e&s;tates within their own families, &s;ince the mo&s;t trifling corre&s;pondence, or any inter|cepted letter, might be made criminal. Then turning to the bench of bi&s;hops, he &s;aid he could hardly account for the inveterate hatred and malice which &s;ome per&s;ons bore to the ingenious bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, unle&s;s it was, that, infatuated like the wild Americans, they fondly hoped to inherit not only the &s;poils, but even the abilities, of the man they &s;hould de&s;troy. Notwith&s;tanding all that was &s;aid in the bi&s;hop's favour, the bill pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him; the other party &s;aying very little, con|&s;cious of a majority in their favour. Among the members of the hou&s;e of commons who exerted them&s;elves in the bi&s;hop's favour, was the celebrated doctor Freind, who was him&s;elf &s;oon after taken into cu&s;tody on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices; but he was admitted to bail, his friend doctor Mead becoming his &s;e|curity. The bi&s;hop's &s;entence being confirm|ed, he in two days after embarked for the continent, attended by his daughter. On the &s;ame day that he landed at Calais, the famous lord Bolingbroke arrived there on his return to England, having, for &s;ome &s;ecret rea&s;ons, obtained his maje&s;ty's pardon. Atterbury being informed of this circum&s;tance, could
<PB N="246" REF="248">
not help ob&s;erving, with a &s;mile, that they were exchanged. The bi&s;hop continued in exile and poverty till he died, though it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that doctor Sache|verel dying &s;ome time before him, left him by will five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The fate of Mr. Chri&s;topher Layer was more &s;evere. Being brought to his trial at the King's Bench, he was convicted of having en|li&s;ted men for the pretender's &s;ervice, of having endeavoured to &s;tir up a rebellion, and he re|ceived &s;entence of death. The circum&s;tances of this con&s;piracy are not clearly known. It is &s;aid, that the intention of the con&s;pirators was, by in|troducing a number of foreign officers and &s;ol|diers into England unob&s;erved, to prepare a junction with the duke of Ormond, who was to have landed in the river with a great quantity of arms provided for that purpo&s;e. However this be, Mr. Layer was reprieved from time to time, and many methods tried to make him di&s;cover his accomplices; but he continued &s;tedfa&s;t in his tru&s;t, &s;o that he &s;uffered death at Tyburn, and his head was fixed on Temple-bar.</P>
<P>This trial was followed by another of a different nature, in which the intere&s;ts and &s;e|curity of the nation were more deeply concern|ed. It had been u&s;ual for the lords chancel|lors,
<PB N="247" REF="249">
upon being appointed to their high of|fice, to nominate the ma&s;ters in chancery; a place of &s;ome value, and con&s;equently then pur|cha&s;ed as commi&s;&s;ions in the army. Some men of improper characters having been appointed to this office, and having embezzled the money of orphans and &s;uitors lodged in their hands, a complaint was made to government, and this drew down the re&s;entment of the mini&s;try on the lord chancellor him&s;elf. He found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to re&s;ign the &s;eals in the beginning; but &s;oon after the king ordered the whole af|fair to be laid before the hou&s;e of commons.</P>
<P>The commons taking the affair into con|deration, and finding many abu&s;es had crept into that court, which either impeded ju&s;tice, or rendered it venal, they re&s;olved to impeach Thomas, earl of Macclesfield, at the bar of the hou&s;e of lords, for high crimes and mi&s;|demeanors.</P>
<P>This was one of the mo&s;t laborious and be&s;t conte&s;ted trials in the annals of England. A bill was previou&s;ly brought in to indemnify the ma&s;ters in chancery from the penalties of the law, upon di&s;covering what con&s;iderations they had paid for their admi&s;&s;ion to their re&s;pective offices. The trial la&s;ted twenty days. The earl proved that &s;uch &s;ums had
<PB N="248" REF="250">
been u&s;ually received by former lord chancel|lors, and rea&s;on told that &s;uch receipts were contrary to &s;trict ju&s;tice. Equity, therefore, prevailed above precedent; the earl was con|victed of fraudulent practices, and condemned to a fine of thirty thou&s;and pounds, with im|pri&s;onment, until that &s;um &s;hould be paid, which was accordingly di&s;charged in about &s;ix weeks after.</P>
<P>In this manner, the corruption, venality, and avarice of the times, had encrea&s;ed with the riches and luxury of the nation. Com|merce introduced fraud, and wealth introduced prodigality. Religion, which might in &s;ome mea&s;ure put a &s;top to the&s;e evils, was rather di&s;couraged than promoted by the legi&s;lature. The hou&s;es of convocation, which had hitherto met purpo&s;ely to in&s;pect the morals of the people, and to maintain decency and dignity in the church, were now entirely di&s;continued. Their di&s;putes among each other were a&s;&s;igned as the cau&s;e; but a mini&s;try, &s;tudious of the morals of the people, would have permitted them to di&s;pute, and kept up their zeal by their activity. But internal regulations were not what the mini&s;try at that time attended to. The chief object of their attention was to gra|tify the &s;overeign with a continual round of
<PB N="249" REF="251">
foreign treaties and alliances. It was natural for a king born and bred in Germany, where all &s;overeignity is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon &s;uch preca|rious tenures, to introduce the &s;ame &s;pirit into the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, however independent it might be as to the re&s;t of Europe. This reign, therefore, was begun by treaties, and the latter part of it was burthened with them. The chief object of all was to &s;ecure to the king his dominions in Germany, and exclude the pretender from tho&s;e of Britain. To effect both purpo&s;es, England paid con&s;iderable &s;ub|&s;idies to many different &s;tates in Europe for the promi&s;e of their protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but it mo&s;t commonly happened, that the con|nexion was changed, or a variance en&s;ued be|fore ever the &s;tipulations on either &s;ide were capable of being executed. In this reign there were concluded no le&s;s than nine treaties. The Barrier convention treaty, a defen&s;ive alliance with the emperor, the triple alliance, the convention treaty, the quadruple alliance, the congre&s;s at Cambray, the treaty of Hano|ver, the treaty of Vienna, and the convention with Sweden and He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el. All the&s;e va|rious and expen&s;ive negociations were mere political play-things; they amu&s;ed for a while, and are &s;ince neglected, the pre&s;ent
<PB N="250" REF="252">
intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions making new and more natural connexions.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned that the parliament made &s;ome new efforts to check the progre&s;s of vice and immorality, which now began to be diffu&s;|ed through every rank of life. But they were &s;upported neither by the co-operation of the mini&s;try, nor the voice of the people. The treaties but ju&s;t concluded with Spain were al|ready broken; for the &s;pirit of commerce was &s;o eager, that no re&s;trictions could bind it. Ad|miral Ho&s;ier was &s;ent to South America to in|tercept the Spani&s;h galeons; but the Spaniards being apprized of his de&s;ign, relanded their trea&s;ure. The greate&s;t part of the Engli&s;h fleet &s;ent on that expedition was rendered en|tirely unfit for &s;ervice. The &s;ea men were cut off in great numbers by the malignity of the climate, and the length of the voyage, while the admiral him&s;elf is &s;aid to have died of a broken heart. In order to retaliate the&s;e ho&s;tilities, the Spaniards undertook the &s;iege of Gibraltar, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s on their &s;ide. In this di&s;pute, France offered her me|diation, and &s;uch a reconciliation as treaties could procure was the con&s;equence; a tempo|rary reconciliation en&s;ued, both &s;ides only watching the occa&s;ion to renew ho&s;tilities with advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="253">It was now two years &s;ince the king had vi&s;ited his electoral dominions of Hanover. He,<MILESTONE N="1727" UNIT="A.D."> there|fore, &s;oon after the breaking up of the parlia|ment, prepared for a journey thither. Having appointed a regency in his ab&s;ence he embark|ed for Holland, and lay, upon his landing, at a little town called Voet. Next day he pro|ceeded on his journey, and in two days more, between ten and eleven at night, arrived at Delden, to all appearance in perfect health. He &s;upped there very heartily, and conti|nued his progre&s;s early the next morning, but between eight and nine ordered his coach to &s;top. It being perceived that one of his hands lay motionle&s;s, Mon&s;ieur Fabrice, who had formerly been &s;ervant to the king of Sweden, and who now attended king George, attempted to quicken the circulation; by cha&s;ing it between his own. As this had no effect, the &s;urgeon who followed on hor&s;e|back, was called, and he al&s;o rubbed it with &s;pirits. Soon after the king's tongue began to &s;well, and he had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to bid them ha&s;ten to O&s;naburgh. Then falling in&s;en|&s;ible into Fabrice's arms, he never recovered, but expired about eleven o'clock the next morning, in the &s;ixty-eighth year of his age, and the thirteenth of his reign.</P>

<P>IN treating of tran&s;actions &s;o recent as tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent reign, it is very difficult to &s;teer between the partialities of mankind. To prai&s;e &s;ome, will be con&s;idered as a tacit reproach upon others; to cea&s;e entirely from cen&s;ure, will be con&s;trued into paltry adulation. We &s;tand too near the &s;ubject to be at liberty to declare all; and the hi&s;torian's own prejudices
<PB N="254" REF="256">
are not le&s;s again&s;t him than tho&s;e prejudices which he would remove in others. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, therefore, the wi&s;e&s;t, though not the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory method, will be to give a &s;light picture of a very bu&s;y reign; rather that part of it which po&s;terity would wi&s;h to know, than that part which might &s;erve to &s;atisfy the cu|rio&s;ity of contending factions.</P>
<P>Upon the death of George the fir&s;t, his &s;on, George the &s;econd, came to the crown; a man of inferior abilities to the late king, and &s;trong|ly bia&s;&s;ed with a partiality to his dominions on the continent. Upon coming to the throne, the bu&s;ine&s;s of government was chiefly carried on by lord Town&s;hend, a man of exten&s;ive knowlege, and great &s;kill in the intere&s;ts of the different &s;tates of Europe, the duke of Newca&s;tle, a nobleman of large connexions among the great, but rather of inferior abili|ties, and the earl of Che&s;terfield, a man of wit, in&s;inuation, and addre&s;s, though rather aver&s;e to the drudgery of bu&s;ine&s;s. But the chief per&s;on, and he who &s;hortly after engro&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;hare of power, was Sir Robert Wal|pole, whom we have already &s;een &s;o actively employed in &s;upporting the hou&s;e of Hanover.</P>
<P>This gentleman had ri&s;en from low begin|nings, through two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns into great
<PB N="255" REF="257">
con&s;ideration. He was con&s;idered as a martyr to his cau&s;e, in the reign of queen Anne; and when the Tory party could no longer oppre&s;s him, he &s;till pre&s;erved that hatred again&s;t them with which he &s;et out. Being rai&s;ed in the beginning of this reign to the head of the trea|&s;ury, he probably &s;et off by endeavouring to &s;erve his country; but &s;oon meeting with &s;trong oppo&s;ition, his &s;ucceeding endeavours were rather employed in keeping his &s;ituation than in adorning it. To defend the declining prerogative of the crown, might perhaps have been the fir&s;t object of his attention; but &s;oon after tho&s;e very mea&s;ures, by which he pre|tended to &s;ecure it, proved the mo&s;t effectual means to le&s;&s;en it. By corrupting the hou&s;e of commons, he encrea&s;ed their riches and their power; and they were not aver&s;e to voting away tho&s;e millions which he permitted them &s;o liberally to &s;hare. As &s;uch a tendency in him naturally produced oppo&s;ition, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t phlegmatic in&s;en&s;ibility to reproach, and a calm di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate manner of rea&s;oning upon &s;uch topics as he de&s;ired &s;hould be believed. His di&s;cour&s;e was fluent, but without dignity; and his manner convincing from its apparent want of art.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="258">The hou&s;e, which was hitherto di&s;tingui&s;hed into Hanoverians and Jacobites, now altered their names with their principles, and the parties on either &s;ide went by the names of the Court and the Country. Both &s;ides had been equally active in bringing in the Hanover family, and con&s;equently neither was much afraid of the reproach of di&s;affection. The court party, who were li&s;ted under the banners of the mini&s;try, were for favouring all their &s;chemes, and for applauding all the mea&s;ures of the crown. They were taught to regard foreign alliances, and continental connexions as conducive to internal &s;ecurity; they con&s;idered England as unable or unfit to be tru&s;ted in defending her|&s;elf, and paid the troops of other countries for their promi&s;es of future a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Of the&s;e, Sir Robert was the leader; and &s;uch as he could not convince by his eloquence, he undertook to buy over by places and pen&s;ions. The other &s;ide, who went by the name of the Country party, were entirely aver&s;e to continent|al connexions. They complained that immen&s;e &s;ums were lavi&s;hed on &s;ub&s;idies which could ne|ver be u&s;eful; and that alliances were bought with money from nations that &s;hould rather con|tribute to England for her protection. The&s;e looked upon the frequent journies of the king
<PB N="257" REF="259">
to Hanover with a jealous eye, and &s;ometimes hinted at a partiality &s;hewn in the royal brea&s;t in its favour. The&s;e were joined by the high-flying Tories, who now began to perceive their own cau&s;e de&s;perate; and as they were leagued with men who did not fear the re|proach of Jacobiti&s;m, they gave and acquired greater confidence. As the court party ge|nerally alarmed the hou&s;e of commons with imaginary dangers and concealed con&s;piracies; &s;o they, on the country &s;ide, generally de|claimed again&s;t the encroachments of the pre|rogative, and the overgrown power of the crown. The complaints of neither were found|ed in fact, the kingdom was in no danger of in|va&s;ions from abroad, or from plots at home; nor was the crown, on the other hand, gaining any acce&s;&s;ion of power, but rather every day lo&s;ing &s;omewhat of its authority by in&s;en&s;ible diminution. The king, chiefly attentive to his foreign dominions, regarded but little his prerogative at home; and he could admit of many limitations in England, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of plenary power in dominions which he pro|bably loved more.</P>
<P>There &s;eem to be two objects of controver|&s;y which, during this whole reign, ro&s;e up in debate at every &s;e&s;&s;ion, and tried the &s;trength
<PB N="258" REF="260">
of the opponents; the&s;e were the national debt, and the number of forces to be kept in pay. The government at the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent king, owed more than thirty millions of money; and though there was a long conti|nuance of profound peace, yet this &s;um was continually found encrea&s;ing. It was much wondered at by the country party, how this could happen, and it was as con&s;tantly the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court to give plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for the encrea&s;e; and to furni&s;h a new &s;ubject of wonder to be debated upon the &s;e&s;&s;ion en|&s;uing. Thus demands for new &s;upplies were made every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, either for the purpo&s;es of &s;ecuring friends upon the con|tinent, of guarding the kingdom from internal con&s;piracies, or of enabling the mini&s;try to act vigorou&s;ly in conjunction with the powers in al|liance abroad. It was vainly alledged, that tho&s;e expences were incurred without pre&s;cience or nece&s;&s;ity, and that the encrea&s;e of the national debt, by multiplying and encrea&s;ing taxes, would at la&s;t become an intolerable burthen. The&s;e arguments were offered, canva&s;&s;ed, and rejected; the court party was con&s;tantly victo|rious, and every demand granted with chear|fulne&s;s and profu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="261">The Spaniards were the fir&s;t nation who &s;hewed the futility of treaties to bind, when any advantage was to be procured by in|fraction. The extreme avidity of our mer|chants, and the natural jealou&s;y and cruelty of that nation, produced every day encroachments on our &s;ide, and as arbitrary &s;eizures on theirs. The people of our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, had long carried on an illicit trade with the &s;ub|jects of Spain upon the continent, but when|ever detected were rigorou&s;ly puni&s;hed, and their cargoes confi&s;cated to the crown. In this teme|rity of adventure on the one hand, and vigilance of pur&s;uit and puni&s;hment on the other, it mu&s;t often have happened that the innocent mu&s;t &s;uffer with the guilty, and many complaints were made, perhaps founded in ju&s;tice, that the Engli&s;h merchants were plundered by the Spani&s;h king's ve&s;&s;els upon the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of America, as if they had been pirates.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h mini&s;try, unwilling to credit every report, which was enflamed by re&s;entment, or urged by avarice, expected to remedy the evils complained of by their favourite &s;y&s;tem of treaty, and in the mean time promi&s;ed the nation redre&s;s. At length, however, the com|plaints became more general, and the mer|chants remon&s;trated, by petition, to the hou&s;e
<PB N="260" REF="262">
of commons, who entered into a deliberation on the &s;ubject. They examined the evidence of &s;everal who had been unju&s;tly &s;eized, and treated with great cruelty. One man, the ma&s;ter of a trading ve&s;&s;el, had been u&s;ed by the Spa|niards in the mo&s;t &s;hocking manner; he gave in his evidence with great preci&s;ion, informed the hou&s;e of the manner they had plundered and &s;tript him, of their cutting off his ears, and their preparing to put him to death.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I then looked up, cried he, to my God for pardon, and to my country for revenge."</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e accounts rai&s;ed a flame among the people, which it was neither the mini&s;ter's intere&s;t, nor perhaps that of the nation to in|dulge; new negociations were &s;et on foot, and new mediators offered their interpo&s;ition. A treaty was &s;igned at Vienna, between the em|peror, the king of Great Britain, and the king of Spain, which &s;ettled the peace of Europe upon its former footing, and put off the threatening war for a time. By this treaty, the king of England conceived hopes that all war would be at an end. Don Carlos, upon the death of the duke of Parma, was, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Engli&s;h fleet, put in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma and Placentia, while &s;ix thou&s;and Spaniards were quietly admitted,
<PB N="261" REF="263">
and quartered in the dutchy of Tu&s;cany, to &s;e|cure for him the rever&s;ion of that dukedom.</P>
<P>An interval of peace &s;ucceeded, in which &s;carce any events happened that de&s;erve the rememberance of an hi&s;torian. Such inter|vals, however, are the &s;ea&s;ons of happine&s;s, for hi&s;tory is generally little more than the regi&s;ter of human contention and calamity.</P>
<P>During this interval of profound peace, no|thing remarkable happened; and &s;carce any conte&s;t en&s;ued, except in the Briti&s;h parlia|ment, where the di&s;putes between the court and country party were carried on with un|cea&s;ing animo&s;ity. Both &s;ides, from moderate beginnings, at la&s;t fairly li&s;ted them&s;elves in the cau&s;e, not of truth, but of party. Mea|&s;ures propo&s;ed by the mini&s;try, though tending to the benefit of the nation, were oppo&s;ed by their antagoni&s;ts, who, on their &s;ide, al&s;o were abridged the power of carrying any act, how beneficial &s;oever it might have been. A calm di&s;intere&s;ted reader, is now &s;urpri&s;ed at the heat with which many &s;ubjects at that time, of little importance in them&s;elves, were di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed. He now &s;miles at the&s;e denunciations of &s;lavery and of ruin, which were entailed up|on po&s;terity, and which po&s;terity did not feel. The truth is, the liberty of a nation is rather
<PB N="262" REF="264">
&s;upported by the oppo&s;ition, than by the &s;peeches of the oppo&s;ition; the combatants may be con&s;idered as ever &s;tanding upon guard, though they are for ever giving a fal&s;e alarm.</P>
<P>In times of profound tranquility, the &s;light|e&s;t occurence comes in to fill up the cha&s;m in hi&s;tory. A &s;ociety of men in this intere&s;ted age of &s;eeming benevolence,<MILESTONE N="1731" UNIT="A.D."> had united them|&s;elves into a company, by the name of the Charitable Corporation; and their profe&s;&s;ed intention, was to lend money at legal intere&s;t to the poor, upon &s;mall pledges, and to per|&s;ons of higher rank upon proper &s;ecurity. Their capital was at fir&s;t limited to thirty thou|&s;and pounds, but they afterwards encrea&s;ed it to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and. This money was &s;up|plied by &s;ub&s;cription, and the care of conduct|ing the capital was intru&s;ted to a proper number of directors. This company having continued for more than twenty years, the ca&s;hier, George Robin&s;on, member for Marlow, and the ware|hou&s;e keeper, John Thomp&s;on, di&s;appeared in one day. Five hundred thou&s;and pounds of capital was &s;ound to be &s;unk and embezzled, by means which the proprietors could not di&s;|cover. They, therefore, in a petition, repre|&s;ented to the hou&s;e the manner in which they had been defrauded, and the di&s;tre&s;s to which
<PB N="263" REF="265">
many of the petitioners were reduced. A &s;e|cret committee being appointed to examine in|to this grievance, a mo&s;t iniquitous &s;cene of fraud was &s;oon di&s;covered, which had been carried on by Thomp&s;on and Robin&s;on, in concert with &s;ome of the directors, for em|bezzling the capital and cheating the proprie|tors. Many per&s;ons of rank and quality were concerned in this infamous con&s;piracy; and even &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the nation did not e&s;cape cen&s;ure. A &s;pirit of avarice and rapacity had infected every rank of life about this time; no le&s;s than &s;ix members of parliament were expelled for the mo&s;t &s;ordid acts of knavery. Sir Robert Sutton, Sir Ar|chibald Grant, and George Robin&s;on, for their frauds in the management of the charitable corporation &s;cheme; Dennis Bond, and Ser|jeant Burch, for a fraudulent &s;ale of the late unfortunate earl of Derwenwater's large e&s;tate; and la&s;tly, John Ward, of Hackney, for forgery. Luxury had given birth to prodigality, and that was the parent of the meane&s;t arts of pe|culation. It was a&s;&s;erted in the hou&s;e of lords, at that time, that not one &s;hilling of the forfeited e&s;tates was ever applied to the &s;er|vice of the public, but became the reward of fraudulence and venality.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="266">From this picture of avarice and luxury among the great, it is not wonderful to find in&s;tances of deplorable wretchedne&s;s among the poor. One Richard Smith, a book-binder, and his wife, had long lived together, and &s;truggled with tho&s;e wants, which, notwith|&s;tanding the profu&s;ion of the rich, pinched the lower orders of mankind. Their mutual af|fection was the only comfort they had in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which di&s;tre&s;&s;es were encrea&s;ed by having a child, which they knew not how to maintain. At length, they took the de&s;perate re&s;olution of dying together; but previou&s;ly their child's throat was cut, and the hu&s;band and wife were found hanging in their little bed-chamber. There was a letter upon the table, containing the rea&s;ons which induced them to this act of de&s;peration; they declared they could no longer &s;upport a life of &s;uch complicated wretchedne&s;s; they recommended their dog and cat to compa&s;&s;ion; but thought it tenderne&s;s to take their only child with them from a world, where they them&s;elves had found &s;o little compa&s;&s;ion. Suicide is often imputed to frenzy. We have here an in&s;tance of &s;elf-murder concerted with compo&s;ure, and bor|rowing the aids of rea&s;on for its vindication.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="267">A &s;cheme &s;et on foot by Sir Robert Wal|pole &s;oon after engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the public, which was to fix a general exci&s;e.<MILESTONE N="1732" UNIT="A.D."> The mini&s;ter introduced it into the hou&s;e, by going into a detail of the frauds practi&s;ed by the factors in London, who were employed by the American planters in &s;elling their tobacco. To prevent the&s;e frauds, he propo&s;ed, that in&s;tead of having the cu&s;toms levied in the u&s;ual manner upon tobacco, all hereafter to be imported &s;hould be lodged in warehou&s;es appointed for that purpo&s;e by the officers of the crown, and &s;hould from thence be &s;old, upon paying the duty of four pence a pound, when the proprietor found a purcha&s;er. This propo&s;al rai&s;ed a violent ferment, not le&s;s within doors than without. It was a&s;&s;erted, that it would expo&s;e the factors to &s;uch hard|&s;hips that they would be unable to continue their trade, and that &s;uch a &s;cheme would not even prevent the frauds complained of. It was added, that a number of additional ex|ci&s;emen and warehou&s;e-keepers would thus be employed, which would at once render the mi|ni&s;try formidable, and the people dependent. Such were the arguments made u&s;e of to &s;tir up the citizens to oppo&s;e this law; arguments rather &s;pecious than &s;olid, &s;ince, with all its
<PB N="266" REF="268">
di&s;advantages, the tax upon tobacco would thus be more &s;afely and expeditiou&s;ly col|lected, and the avenues to numberle&s;s frauds would be &s;hut up. The people, however, were rai&s;ed into &s;uch a ferment, that the par|liament hou&s;e was &s;urrounded with multitudes, who intimidated the mini&s;try, and compelled them to drop the de&s;ign. The mi&s;carriage of the bill was celebrated with public rejoicings in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the mini&s;ter was burned in effigy by the populace of Lon|don.</P>
<P>The members of the oppo&s;ition acquired &s;uch &s;trength and popularity by defeating the mini&s;try in this &s;cheme, that they re&s;olved to try their forces in an offen&s;ive mea&s;ure, and made a motion for repealing the &s;eptennial bill, and bringing back triennal parliaments, as &s;ettled at the Revolution. In the cour&s;e of this debate the country party reflected with great &s;everity on the mea&s;ures of the late reign, and the conduct of the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter. It was alledged, that the &s;eptennial bill was an encroachment on the rights of the people, and that there was no method to overturn a wicked mini&s;try, but by frequent changes of par|liament.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let us &s;uppo&s;e a man, &s;aid Sir William Wyndham, of no great family,

Suppo&s;e this man rai&s;ed to great wealth, the plunder of the nation, with a parliament chiefly compo&s;ed of members, who&s;e &s;eats are purcha&s;ed, and who&s;e votes are venal.

With &s;uch a mini&s;ter, and &s;uch a parliament, let us &s;up|po&s;e a ca&s;e, which I hope will never hap|pen, a prince upon the throne uninformed, ignorant, and unacquainted with the incli|nations and true intere&s;ts of his people; weak, capricious, tran&s;ported with un|bounded ambition, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with in&s;a|tiable avarice. I hope &s;uch a ca&s;e will ne|ver occur; but as it po&s;&s;ibly may, could any greater cur&s;e happen to a nation than &s;uch a prince advi&s;ed by &s;uch a mini&s;ter,

Notwith&s;tand|ing the warmth of the oppo&s;ition, the mini&s;try, exerting all their &s;trength, were victorious, and the motion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the majority. However, as the country party &s;eemed to grow more powerful on this occa&s;ion than formerly, it was thought fit to di&s;&s;olve the parliament, and another was convoked by the &s;ame pro|clamation.<MILESTONE N="1734" UNIT="A.D."></P>
<P>The leaders of both parties in the new par|liament were preci&s;ely the &s;ame as in the pre|ceding, and the &s;ame mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued and oppo&s;ed with &s;imilar animo&s;ity. A bill was brought in for fixing the prince of Wales's hou&s;ehold at one hundred thou&s;and pounds a year. This took ri&s;e among the country party, and being oppo&s;ed, was thrown out by the courtiers. A &s;cheme was propo&s;ed by Sir John Barnard for dimini&s;hing the intere&s;t on the national debt, and rejected in the &s;ame manner. But it was otherwi&s;e with a bill in|troduced
<PB N="269" REF="271">
by the mini&s;try for &s;ubjecting the play-hou&s;es to a licen&s;er.</P>
<P>The pre&s;s had for &s;ome time taken the popular &s;ide of every que&s;tion; and the play-hou&s;es find|ing mo&s;t money was to be got by chiming in with the national humour, thought that expo&s;|ing the mini&s;try would procure &s;pectators. At a little theatre in the Hay-market the mini&s;try were every night ridiculed, and their dre&s;s and manner exactly imitated. The ingenious Mr. Henry Fielding finding that the public had no ta&s;te for new pieces of real humour, was willing to gratify their appetite for &s;candal, and brought on a theatrical thing, which he called Pa&s;quin; the public applauded its &s;e|verity, and the repre&s;entation was crowded for &s;everal nights running, and Fielding be|gan to congratulate him&s;elf upon his dexterity, in di&s;carding wit from the &s;tage, and &s;ub&s;ti|tuting politics, which the people liked better. The abu&s;e, however, threatened to become dangerous, and the mini&s;try, &s;en&s;ible of their &s;trength, were re&s;olved, as they expre&s;&s;ed it, to &s;uppre&s;s the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tage. Some of the pieces exhibited at that time were not only &s;evere, but immoral al&s;o. On this ground the mini&s;try made their attack. Sir Robert Walpole brought in a bill to
<PB N="270" REF="272">
limit the number of play-hou&s;es, to &s;ubject all dramatic writings to the in&s;pection of the lord-chamberlain, and to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch as he thought would have a tendency to corrupt mens morals, or ob&s;truct government. The bill was oppo&s;ed by lord Che&s;terfield with great eloquence; but carried by a majority deter|mined to vote with the mini&s;ter. This bill, while it confined genius on the one hand, turned it to proper objects of pur&s;uit on the other, and the &s;tage is at pre&s;ent free from the &s;candalous licence which infects the pre&s;s; but perhaps rendered more dull from the abridgement of unlimited abu&s;e.</P>
<P>New &s;ubjects of controver&s;y offered every day; and the members on each &s;ide were ready enough to &s;eize them. A convention agreed upon by the mini&s;try, at the Prado, with Spain, became an object of warm altercation. By this the court of Spain agreed to pay the &s;um of ninety-five thou&s;and pounds to the Engli&s;h, as a &s;atisfaction for all demands upon the crown, and the &s;ubjects of that kingdom, and to di&s;charge the whole within four months, from the day of ratification. This, however, was con&s;idered as no equivalent to the damages that had been &s;u&s;tained; the country party de|claimed
<PB N="271" REF="273">
again&s;t it as a &s;acrifice of the intere&s;ts of Great Britain to the court of Spain, and al|ledged that the whole of their demands &s;hould be paid, which amounted to three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds. The mini&s;ter on this occa&s;ion was provoked into unu&s;ual vehe|mence. He branded the oppo&s;ite party with the appellation of traitors, and expre&s;&s;ed his hope that their behaviour would unite all the true friends of the pre&s;ent government in op|po&s;ing their de&s;igns. The mini&s;try on this oc|ca&s;ion were as u&s;ual victorious; and the coun|try party finding them&s;elves out-voted in every debate, re&s;olved to withdraw for ever. They had long a&s;&s;erted that all deliberation was u&s;e|le&s;s, and debate vain, &s;ince every member had li&s;ted him&s;elf not under the banners of rea|&s;on, but of party. De&s;pairing, therefore, of being able to oppo&s;e with any hopes of con|viction, and &s;en&s;ible of the popularity of their cau&s;e, they retired from parliament to their &s;eats in the country, and left the mini&s;try an undi&s;puted majority in the hou&s;e of com|mons.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter being now left without oppo|&s;ition, was re&s;olved to give his opponents the the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible mortification, by an alteration in his conduct. He took this opportunity to
<PB N="272" REF="274">
render them odious, or contemptible, by pa&s;&s;|ing &s;everal u&s;eful laws in their ab&s;ence. At the &s;ame time the king him&s;elf laboured with equal a&s;&s;iduity at his favourite object of ad|ju&s;ting the political &s;cale of Europe. For this purpo&s;e, he made &s;everal journies to the con|tinent; but in the mean time a rupture of a dome&s;tic nature was likely to be attended with many inconveniences. A mi&s;under&s;tanding aro&s;e between the king and the prince of Wales; and as the latter was the darling of the people, his cau&s;e was &s;econded by all tho&s;e of the country party. The prince had been a &s;hort time before married to the prince&s;s of Saxegotha, and the prince taking umbrage at the &s;cantine&s;s of his yearly allowance from his father, &s;eldom vi&s;ited the court. The prince&s;s had advanced to the la&s;t month of her preg|nancy before the king had any notice of the event; and &s;he was actually brought to bed of a prince&s;s, without properly acquainting the king. In con&s;equence of this, his maje&s;ty &s;ent his &s;on a me&s;&s;age, informing him, that the whole tenor of his conduct had of late been &s;o void of real duty, that he re&s;olved to puni&s;h him by forbidding him the court. He, therefore, &s;ignified his plea&s;ure that he &s;hould leave St. James's with all his family, and, in
<PB N="273" REF="275">
con&s;equence, the prince retired to Kew. This rupture was very favourable to the country intere&s;t, as they thus had a con&s;iderable per|&s;onage equally intere&s;ted with them&s;elves to oppo&s;e the mini&s;try. To the prince, there|fore, re&s;orted all tho&s;e who formed future ex|pectations of ri&s;ing in the &s;tate, and all who had rea&s;on to be di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent conduct of admini&s;tration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVI. GEORGE II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>EVER &s;ince the treaty of Utrecht, the Spaniards in America had in&s;ulted and di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed the commerce of Great Britain, and the Briti&s;h merchants had attempted to carry on an illicit trade into their dominions. A right which the Engli&s;h merchants claimed by trea|ty, of cutting log-wood in the bay of Cam|peachy, gave them frequent opportunities of pu&s;hing in contraband commodities upon the continent; &s;o that to &s;uppre&s;s the evil, the Spaniards were re&s;olved to annihilate the claim. This liberty of cutting log-wood had often been acknowledged, but never clearly a&s;cer|tained; in all former treaties, it was con&s;idered as an object of too little importance to make a &s;eparate article in any negociation. The Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els appointed for protecting the coa&s;t continued their &s;everities upon the Eng|li&s;h; many of the &s;ubjects of Britain were &s;ent to dig in the mines of Poto&s;i, and deprived of all means of conveying their complaints to
<PB N="275" REF="277">
tho&s;e who might &s;end them redre&s;s. One re|mon&s;trance followed another to the court of Madrid of this violation of treaty; but the only an&s;wer given were promi&s;es of en|quiry, which produced no reformation. Our merchants complained loudly of tho&s;e outrages; but the mini&s;ter vainly expected from negociations that redre&s;s, which was only to be obtained by arms.</P>
<P>The fears di&s;covered by the court of Great Britain only &s;erved to encrea&s;e the in&s;olence of the enemy; and their guard &s;hips con|tinued to &s;eize not only all the guilty, but the innocent, whom they found &s;ailing along the Spani&s;h main. At la&s;t, however, the com|plaints of the Engli&s;h merchants were loud enough to intere&s;t the hou&s;e of commons; their letters and memorials were produced, and their grievances enforced by council at the bar of the hou&s;e. It was &s;oon found that the money which Spain had agreed to pay to the court of Great Britain was with-held, and no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the delay. The mini&s;ter, therefore, to gratify the general ardour, and to atone for his former deficiencies, a&s;&s;ured the hou&s;e that he would put the nation into a con|dition for war. Soon after letters of repri&s;al were granted again&s;t the Spaniards, and this
<PB N="276" REF="278">
being on both &s;ides con&s;idered as an actual commencement of ho&s;tilities, both diligently &s;et forward their armaments by &s;ea and land. In this threatening &s;ituation, the French mini|&s;ter at the Hague declared that his ma&s;ter was obliged by treaty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king of Spain; &s;o that the alliances, which but twenty years before had taken place, were now quite rever&s;|ed. At that time France and England were combined again&s;t Spain; at pre&s;ent, France and Spain were united again&s;t England; &s;uch little hopes can &s;tate&s;men place upon the firm|e&s;t treaties, where there is no &s;uperior power to compel the ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P>A rupture between England and Spain be|ing now become unavoidable, the people, who had long clamoured for war, began to feel uncommon alacrity at its approach; and the mini&s;try, finding it inevitable, began to be as earne&s;t in preparation. Orders were i&s;&s;ued for augmenting the land forces, and rai&s;ing a body of marines.<MILESTONE N="1739" UNIT="A.D."> War was declared with all proper &s;olemnity, and &s;oon after two rich Spani&s;h prizes were taken in the Mediterranean. Admiral Vernon, a man of more courage than experience, of more confidence than &s;kill, was &s;ent commander of a fleet into the We&s;t Indies, to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy in that part of the globe.
<PB N="277" REF="279">
He had a&s;&s;erted in the hou&s;e of Commons that Porto Belo, a fort and harbour in South Ame|rica, could be ea&s;ily de&s;troyed, and that he him&s;elf would undertake to reduce it with &s;ix &s;hips only. A project which appeared &s;o wild and impo&s;&s;ible, was ridiculed by the mi|ni&s;try; but as he &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon the propo&s;al, they complied with his reque&s;t, hoping that his want of &s;ucce&s;s might repre&s;s the confidence of his party. In this, however, they were di&s;appointed; for with &s;ix &s;hips only, he attacked and demoli&s;hed all the fortifications of the place, and came away victorious, with &s;carce the lo&s;s of a man. This victory was magnified at home in all the &s;trains of pane|gyric, and the triumph was far &s;uperior to the value of the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>As the war began thus &s;ucce&s;sfully, it in&s;pir|ed the commons to pro&s;ecute it with all ima|ginable vigour. The mini&s;ter was granted &s;uch &s;upplies as enabled him to equip a very powerful navy. They voted a &s;ub&s;idy to the king of Denmark, and impowered the king to defray &s;ome other expences not mentioned in the e&s;timates of the year. As the preparations for war encrea&s;ed in every part of the king|dom, the dome&s;tic debates and factions &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;ide; and indeed it &s;eems to have been
<PB N="278" REF="280">
the peculiar felicity of this nation, that every &s;pecies of activity takes its turn to occupy the people. In a nation like this, arts and luxury, commerce and war, at certain intervals, mu&s;t ever be &s;erviceable. This vici&s;&s;itude turns the current of wealth from one determined chan|nel, and gives it a diffu&s;ive &s;pread over the face of the country; it is at one time diverted to the laborious and frugal, at another to the brave, active, and enterprizing. Thus all or|ders of mankind find encouragement, and the nation becomes compo&s;ed of individuals, who have art to acquire property, and who have courage to defend it.</P>
<P>While vigorous preparations were making in other departments, a &s;quadron of &s;hips was equipped for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy in the South &s;eas, the command of which was given to com|modore An&s;on. This fleet was de&s;tined to &s;ail through the &s;treights of Magellan, and &s;teering northwards along the coa&s;ts Chili and Peru, to co-operate occa&s;ionly with admiral Vernon acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of Darien. The delays and mi&s;takes of the mini&s;try fru&s;trated that part of the &s;cheme, which was originally well laid. When it was too late in the &s;ea&s;on, the com|modore &s;et out with five &s;hips of the line, a frigate, and two &s;tore-&s;hips, with about four|teen
<PB N="279" REF="281">
hundred men. Having reached the coa&s;ts of Brazil, he refre&s;hed his men for &s;ome time on the i&s;land of St. Catharine, a &s;pot that enjoys all the fruitfulne&s;s and verdure of the luxurious tropical climate. From thence he &s;teered downward into the cold and tem|pe&s;tuous regions of the &s;outh; and in about five months after, meeting a terrible tempe&s;t, he doubled Cape Horn. By this time his fleet was di&s;per&s;ed, and his crew deplorably di&s;abled with the &s;curvy; &s;o that with much difficulty he gained the delightful i&s;land of Juan Fernandez. There he was joined by one &s;hip, and a frigate of &s;even guns. From thence advancing northward, he landed on the coa&s;t of Chili, and attacked the city of Paita by night. In this bold attempt he made no u&s;e of his &s;hipping, nor even di&s;embarked all his men; a few &s;oldiers, favoured by dark|ne&s;s, &s;ufficed to fill the whole town with terror and confu&s;ion. The governor of the garri|&s;on, and the inhabitants, fled on all &s;ides; ac|cu&s;tomed to be &s;evere, they expected &s;everity. In the mean time, a &s;mall body of the Eng|li&s;h kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town for three days, &s;tripping it of all its trea&s;ures and merchan|di&s;e to a con&s;iderable amount, and then &s;etting it on fire.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="282">Soon after this &s;mall &s;quadron advanced as far as Panama, &s;ituated on the i&s;thmus of Da|rien, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the great Ameri|can continent. The commodore now placed all his hopes in taking one of tho&s;e valuable Spani&s;h &s;hips, which trade from the Philippine I&s;lands to Mexico. Not above one or two at the mo&s;t of the&s;e immen&s;ely rich &s;hips went from one continent to the other in a year; they were, therefore, very large, in order to carry a &s;ufficiency of trea&s;ure, and proportionably &s;trong to defend it. In hopes of meeting with one of the&s;e, the commodore, with his little fleet, traver&s;ed the great Pacific Ocean; but the &s;curvy once more vi&s;iting his crew, &s;everal of his men died, and almo&s;t all were di&s;abled. In this exigence having brought all his men into one ve&s;&s;el, and &s;et fire to the other, he &s;teered for the i&s;land of Tinian, which lies about half way between the new world and the old. In this charming abode he continued for &s;ome time, till his men recovered their health, and his &s;hip was re&s;itted for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>Thus refre&s;hed he &s;et forward for China, where he laid in proper &s;tores for once more traver&s;ing back that immen&s;e ocean in which he had ju&s;t before &s;uffered &s;uch immen&s;e diffi|culties. Having accordingly taken &s;ome Dutch
<PB N="281" REF="283">
and Indian &s;ailors on board, he again &s;teered towards America, and at length, after various toils, di&s;covered the Spani&s;h galleon he had &s;o long ardently expected. This ve&s;&s;el was built as well for the purpo&s;es of war as of merchan|di&s;e. It mounted &s;ixty guns, and five hundred men, while the crew of the commodore did not amount to half that number. However the victory was on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h, and they returned home with their immen&s;e prize, which was e&s;timated at three hundred and thirteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, while the different captures that had been made before amounted to as much more. Thus after a voyage of three years, conducted with amaz|ing per&s;everance and intrepidity, the public &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of a noble fleet; but a few individuals became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e riches.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Engli&s;h conducted other operations again&s;t the enemy with amaz|ing activity. When An&s;on &s;et out it was with a de&s;ign of acting a &s;ubordinate part to a for|midable armament de&s;igned for the coa&s;ts of New Spain, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-nine &s;hips of the line, and almo&s;t an equal number of fri|gates, furni&s;hed with all kinds of warlike &s;tores, near fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen, and as
<PB N="282" REF="284">
many land-forces. Never was a fleet more completely equipped, nor never had the nation more &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Lord Cath|cart was appointed to command the land|forces; but he dying on the pa&s;&s;age, the com|mand devolved upon general Wentworth, who&s;e abilities were &s;uppo&s;ed to be unequal to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. The mini&s;try, without any vi&s;ible rea&s;on, detained the fleet in England, until the &s;ea&s;on for action in America was nearly over. In the country where they were to carry on their operations, periodical rains begin about the end of April, and this change in the climate as &s;urely bring on epidemical and contagious di&s;ea&s;es. Hav|ing at length arrived on the coa&s;ts of New Spain, before the wealthy city of Carthagena, they landed their forces, in order to form the &s;iege of this important fortification. This city, which lies within &s;ixty miles of Panama, &s;erves as a magazine for the merchandi&s;e of Spain, which is conveyed from Europe thither, and from thence tran&s;ported by land to Panama, to be exchanged for the native commodities of the new world. The taking of Carthagena, therefore, would have ob&s;tructed the whole trade between Old Spain and the New.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="285">To carry on the &s;iege with &s;afety, the troops were landed on the i&s;land Tierra Bomba, near the mouth of the harbour, which had been previou&s;ly fortified by all the arts of engineer|ing. The land-forces erected a battery on &s;hore, with which they made a breach in the principal fort, while Vernon, who commanded the fleet, &s;ent a number of &s;hips into the har|bour, to divide the fire of the enemy, and to co-operate with the army on &s;hore. The breach being deemed practicable, a body of troops were commanded to &s;torm; but the Spaniards de&s;erted the forts, which, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of courage, they might have defended with &s;ucce&s;s. The troops, upon gaining this ad|vantage, were advanced a good deal nearer the city; but they there met a much greater oppo&s;ition than they had expected. It was found, or a&s;&s;erted, that the fleet could not lie near enough to batter the town, and that no|thing remained but to attempt one of the forts by &s;caling. The leaders of the fleet and the army began mutually to accu&s;e each other, each a&s;&s;erting the probability of what the other denied. At length, Wentworth, &s;timulated by the admiral's reproach, re&s;olved to try the dangerous experiment, and ordered that fort St. Lazare &s;hould be attempted by &s;calade. No|thing
<PB N="284" REF="286">
could be more unfortunate than this un|dertaking; the forces marching up to the at|tack, their guides were &s;lain, and they mi&s;took their way. In&s;tead of attempting the weake&s;t part of the fort, they advanced to where it was &s;tronge&s;t, and where they were expo&s;ed to the fire of the town. Colonel Grant, who commanded the grenadiers, was killed in the beginning. Soon after it was found that their &s;caling ladders were too &s;hort; the officers were perplexed for want of orders, and the troops &s;tood expo&s;ed to the whole fire of the enemy, without knowing how to proceed. After bearing a dreadful fire for &s;ome hours with great intrepidity, they at length retreated leaving &s;ix hundred men dead on the &s;pot. The terrors of the climate &s;oon began to be more dreadful than tho&s;e of war; the rainy &s;ea&s;on began with &s;uch violence, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the troops to continue encamped; and the mortality of the &s;ea&s;on now began to attack them in all its frightful varieties. To the&s;e calamities, &s;ufficient to quell any enter|prize, was added the di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the land and &s;ea commanders, who blamed each other for every failure, and became frantic with mutual recrimination. They only, there|fore, at la&s;t could be brought to agree in one
<PB N="285" REF="287">
mortifiying mea&s;ure, which was to reimbark the troops, and to withdraw them as quick as po&s;&s;ible from this &s;cene of &s;laughter and contagion.</P>
<P>The fortifications near the barbour being demoli&s;hed, the troops were conveyed back to Jamaica, and this i&s;land, which of it&s;elf is &s;uf|ficiently unhealthy, was con&s;idered as a para|di&s;e to that from which they had ju&s;t e&s;caped. This fatal mi&s;carriage, which tarni&s;hed the Briti&s;h glory, was no &s;ooner known in Eng|land, than the kingdom was filled with mur|murs and di&s;content. The loude&s;t bur&s;t of indignation was directed at the mini&s;ter; and they who once prai&s;ed him for &s;ucce&s;&s;es he did not merit, condemned him now for a failure, of which he was guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P>To this cau&s;e of complaint, &s;everal others were added. The inactivity of the Engli&s;h fleet at home was among the principal. Sir John Nor|ris had twice &s;ailed to the coa&s;ts of Spain, at the head of a very powerful &s;quadron, without tak|ing any effectual &s;tep to annoy the enemy. The Spani&s;h privateers, become numerous and en|terprizing, annoyed commerce with great &s;uc|ce&s;s, having taken &s;ince the commencement of the war, four hundred and &s;even &s;hips be|longing to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain. The
<PB N="286" REF="288">
Engli&s;h though at an immen&s;e expence in equipping fleets, &s;eemed to lie down unre|venged under every blow, and &s;uffered one lo&s;s after another without repri&s;al. This uni|ver&s;al di&s;content had a manife&s;t influence upon the general election which followed &s;oon after; <MILESTONE N="1741" UNIT="A.D."> and the complaints again&s;t the mini&s;ter be|came &s;o general, that he began to tremble for his &s;afety. All the adherents of the prince of Wales, who continued to live retired from court, as private gentleman, concurred in the oppo&s;ition. Ob&s;tinate &s;truggles were main|tained in all parts of the kingdom; and &s;uch a national &s;pirit prevailed, that the country intere&s;t now at la&s;t &s;eemed ready to prepon|derate.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, the mini&s;ter finding the &s;trength of the hou&s;e of commons turned a|gain&s;t him, tried every art to break that con|federacy, which he knew he had not &s;trength to oppo&s;e. His fir&s;t attempt was by endea|vouring to di&s;engage the prince from his party, by promi&s;es of royal favour, and other emolu|ments. The bi&s;hop of Oxford was according|ly &s;ent to him, with an offer, that if he would write a letter of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the king, he and all his coun&s;ellors &s;hould be taken into favour; fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be added to his
<PB N="287" REF="289">
revenue, two hundred thou&s;and &s;hould be granted him to pay his debts, and &s;uitable pro|vi&s;ion &s;hould be made in due time for all his followers. This, to a per&s;on already involved in debt, from the &s;cantine&s;s of his pen&s;ion, and the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up his indignity, was a tempting offer. However, the prince gener|ou&s;ly di&s;dained it, declaring he would accept of no conditions dictated to him under the in|fluence of a mini&s;ter, who&s;e mea&s;ures he di&s;ap|proved.</P>
<P>Walpole now &s;aw that his power was at an end; but he &s;till feared more for his per&s;on. The re&s;entment of the people had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him to an extravagant height; and their leaders taught them to expect very &s;ignal ju&s;tice on their &s;uppo&s;ed oppre&s;&s;or. The fir&s;t occa&s;ion he had to find the hou&s;e of commons turned again&s;t him was in debating upon &s;ome di&s;puted elections. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, which was heard at the bar of the hou&s;e, he carried his point by a majority of &s;ix only, and this he looked upon as a defeat, rather than a victory. The incon&s;iderable majority that appeared on his &s;ide, which had long been u&s;ed to carry every que&s;tion with ea&s;e, plainly proved that his friends were no longer able to protect him. A petition, pre&s;ented by the electors of We&s;t|min&s;ter,
<PB N="288" REF="290">
complaining of an undue election, which had been carried on by the unju&s;t in|fluence of the mini&s;try, and which they begged to &s;et a&s;ide, was pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e. Sir Ro|bert laboured with all his art to over-rule their petition; the hou&s;e entered into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and carried it again&s;t him by a majority of four voices. He re&s;olved to try his &s;trength once more in another di&s;puted election, and had the mor|tification to &s;ee the majority again&s;t him aug|mented to &s;ixteen. He then declared he would never &s;it more in that hou&s;e; and the next day the king adjourned both hou&s;es of parliament for a few days, and in the interim Sir Robert Walpole, was created earl of Or|ford, and re&s;igned all his employments.</P>
<P>Nothing could give the people more gene|ral &s;atisfaction than this mini&s;ter's depo&s;ition. It was now univer&s;ally expected that his power being abridged, his puni&s;hment was to follow; and mankind prepared them&s;elves for &s;ome tra|gical event with vindictive &s;atisfaction. Every per&s;on now flattered him&s;elf, that every dome&s;tic grievance would be redre&s;&s;ed; that commerce would be protected abroad; that the expen&s;ive &s;ub&s;idies to foreign &s;tates would be retrenched, and that the hou&s;e of commons would be un|aminous in every popular mea&s;ure. But they
<PB N="289" REF="291">
&s;oon found them&s;elves mi&s;erably deceived. Tho&s;e who clamoured mo&s;t again&s;t him, when put into power, began exactly to adopt all his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>At no time of life did this mini&s;ter acquit him&s;elf with &s;uch art as on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion. The country party con&s;i&s;ted of Tories, reinforced by di&s;contented Whigs; the former, implacable in their re&s;entments again&s;t him, could not be mollified; the latter, either &s;oured by di&s;appoinment, or incited by ambition, only wi&s;hed his removal. To the&s;e, therefore, Walpole applied, and was willing to grant them that power they aimed at, in return for which he only demanded impunity. The offer was accepted with plea&s;ure; their Tory friends were in&s;tantly abandoned; and a breach thus en&s;uing, the &s;ame oppo&s;ition &s;till continued again&s;t the new mini&s;try, that had obtained again&s;t the old.</P>
<P>The place of chancellor of the Exchequer was be&s;towed on Mr. Sandys, who was like|wi&s;e appointed a lord of the trea&s;ury. Lord Harrington was declared pre&s;ident of the coun|cil; and in his room lord Carteret became &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate. Mr. Pulteney was &s;worn of the privy-council, and afterwards created earl of Bath. The reconciliation between the king
<PB N="290" REF="292">
and the prince of Wales took place &s;oon after; and the change in the mini&s;try was celebrated by rejoicings over the whole nation.</P>
<P>But this tran&s;port was of &s;hort duration; it &s;oon appeared that tho&s;e who declaimed mo&s;t loudly for the liberties of the people, had adopted new mea&s;ures with their new employ|ments. The new converts were branded as betrayers of the intere&s;ts of their country; but particularly the re&s;entment of the people fell upon the earl of Bath, who had long declaim|ed again&s;t that very conduct he now &s;eemed earne&s;t to pur&s;ue. He had been the idol of the people, and con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous champions that had ever defended the cau&s;e of freedom; but allured perhaps with the hope of governing in Walpole's place, he was contented to give up his popularity for ambi|tion. The king, however, treated him with that neglect which he merited; he was laid a&s;ide for life, and continued a wretched &s;urvi|vor of all his former importance.</P>
<P>The war with Spain had now continued for &s;e|veral years, and was attended with but indiffer|ent fortune. Some un&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions had been carried on in the We&s;t-Indies, under ad|miral Vernon, commodore Knowles, and others; and the failure of the&s;e was &s;till more aggra|vated
<PB N="291" REF="293">
by the political writers of the day; a cla&s;s of beings that had ri&s;en up during this and the preceding admini&s;tration, at fir&s;t employed again&s;t Walpole, and afterwards taken into pay by him. Dull, and without principle, they made them&s;elves agreeable to the public by impudence and abu&s;e, em|barra&s;&s;ed every operation, and embittered every misfortune. The&s;e had for &s;ome time di&s;gu&s;t|ed the nation of their operations by &s;ea, and taught them to wi&s;h for better fortune on land. The people became ripe for renewing their victories in Flanders, and the king de&s;ired no|thing with &s;o much ardour. It was re&s;olved, therefore, to &s;end a powerful body of men into the Netherlands to join in the quarrels that were beginning on the continent; and immen&s;e triumphs were expected from &s;uch an under|taking, which the king re&s;olved to conduct in per&s;on.</P>
<P>An army of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men were therefore &s;hipped over into Flanders, and the war with Spain became but an object of &s;econ|dary con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVII. GEORGE II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>TO have a clear, yet conci&s;e idea of the origin of the troubles on the continent, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to go back for &s;ome years, and trace the mea&s;ures of the European republic from that period where we left them in our former narrative. After the duke of Orleans, who had been regent of France, died, cardinal Fleury undertook to &s;ettle the great confu&s;ion in which that luxurious prince had left the kingdom. His moderation and prudence were equally con&s;picuous; he was &s;incere, frugal, mode&s;t, and &s;imple: under him, therefore, France repaired her lo&s;&s;es, and enriched her&s;elf by commerce; he only left the &s;tate to its own natural methods of thriving, and he &s;aw it every day a&s;&s;uming its former health and vi|gour.</P>
<P>During the long interval of peace, which this mini&s;ter's councils had procured for Eu|rope, two powers, till now unregarded, began to attract the notice and jealou&s;y of the neigh|bouring
<PB N="293" REF="295">
nations. Peter the Great had already civilized Ru&s;&s;ia, and this new created exten|&s;ive empire began to influence the councils of other nations, and to give laws to the North. The other power that came into notice, was that of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e dominions were compact and populous, and who&s;e forces were well maintained and ready for action.</P>
<P>The other &s;tates were but little improved for the purpo&s;es of renewing the war. The empire remained under the government of Charles the &s;ixth, who had been placed upon the throne by the treaty of Utrecht. Sweden continued to langui&s;h, being not yet recovered from the de&s;tructive projects of her darling monarch, Charles the twelfth. Denmark was powerful enough, but inclined to peace; and part of Italy &s;till remained &s;ubject to tho&s;e princes who had been impo&s;ed upon it by foreign treaties.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;tates, however, continued to en|joy a profound peace, until the death of Au|gu&s;tus, king of Poland, by which a general flame was once more kindled in Europe. The emperor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the arms of Ru&s;&s;ia, declared for the elector of Saxony, &s;on to the decea&s;ed king. On the other hand, France declared for Stani&s;laus, who long &s;ince had been nominated king of the Poles by Charles
<PB N="294" REF="296">
of Sweden, and who&s;e daughter the king of France had &s;ince married. In order to drive forward his preten&s;ions, Stani&s;laus repaired to Dantzick, where the people very gladly re|ceived him. But his triumph was &s;hort; ten thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians appearing before the place, the Poli&s;h nobility di&s;per&s;ed, and Stani&s;laus was be&s;ieged by this &s;mall body of forces. But though the city was taken, the king e&s;|caped with &s;ome difficulty by night; and fifteen hundred men, that were &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were made pri&s;oners of war. France, how|ever, re&s;olved to continue her a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him, and this it was &s;uppo&s;ed would be mo&s;t ef|fectually done by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>The views of France were &s;econded by Spain and Sardinia, both having hopes to grow more powerful by a divi&s;ion of the &s;poils of Au&s;tria. A French army, therefore, &s;oon over-ran the empire, under the conduct of old mar&s;hal Villars; while the duke of Mon|temar, the general of Spain, was equally vic|torious in the kingdom of Naples. Thus the emperor had the mortification to &s;ee his own dominions ravaged, and a great part of Italy torn from him, only for having attempt|ed to give a king to Poland.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="297">The&s;e rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;es of France and its al|lies, &s;oon compelled the emperor to demand a peace. It was accordingly granted him; but Stani&s;laus, upon who&s;e account the war was begun, was neglected in the treaty. It was &s;tipulated that he &s;hould renounce all claim to the crown of Poland, for which the emperor gratified France with the dutchy of Lorraine, and &s;ome other valuable territories.</P>
<P>The emperor dying in the year 1740, the French began to think this a favourable op|portunity for exerting their ambition once more. Regardle&s;s of treaties, particularly that called the pragmatic &s;anction, by which the rever&s;ion of all the late emperor's dominions was &s;ettled upon his daughter, they cau&s;ed the elector of Bavaria to be crowned emperor. Thus the queen of Hungary, daughter of Charles the &s;ixth, de&s;cended from an illu&s;|trious line of emperors, &s;aw her&s;elf &s;tripped of her inheritance, and left for a whole year de|&s;erted by all Europe, and without any hopes of &s;uccour. She had &s;carce clo&s;ed her father's eyes, when &s;he lo&s;t Sile&s;ia, by an irruption of the young king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who &s;eized the op|portunity of her defencele&s;s &s;tate to renew his ancient preten&s;ions to that province, of which it mu&s;t be owned his ance&s;tors had been un|ju&s;tly
<PB N="296" REF="298">
deprived. France, Saxony, and Bava|ria, attacked the re&s;t of her dominions; Eng|land was the only ally that &s;eemed willing to e&s;pou&s;e her helple&s;s condition. Sardinia, and Holland, &s;oon after came to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and la&s;t of all Ru&s;&s;ia acceded to the union in her favour.</P>
<P>It may now be demanded, what cau&s;e Bri|tain had to intermeddle in the&s;e continental &s;chemes. It can only be an&s;wered, that the intere&s;ts of Hanover, and the &s;ecurity of that electorate, depended upon the nicely balancing the different intere&s;ts of the empire; and the Engli&s;h mini&s;try were willing to gratify the king. Lord Carteret, who had now taken up that place in the royal confidence which had formerly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Walpole, by pur|&s;uing the&s;e mea&s;ures &s;oothed the wi&s;hes of his ma&s;ter, and opened a more exten&s;ive field for his own ambition. He expected to receive honour from victories which he &s;eemed cer|tain of obtaining; and de&s;ired to engage in mea&s;ures which mu&s;t be injurious to the na|tion, even though attended with de&s;ired &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>When the parliament met, his maje&s;ty be|gan by informing them of his &s;trict adherence to engagements; and that he had &s;ent a body
<PB N="297" REF="299">
of Engli&s;h forces into the Netherlands, which he had augmented by &s;ixteen thou&s;and Ha|noverians, to make a diver&s;ion upon the do|minions of France, in the queen of Hungary's favour. When the &s;upplies came to be con|&s;idered, by which this additional number of Hanoverian troops was to be paid by Eng|land for defending their own cau&s;e, it produ|ced mo&s;t violent debates in both hou&s;es of par|liament. It was con&s;idered as an impo&s;ition upon the nation, as an attempt to pay foreign troops for fighting their own battles, and the mini&s;try were pre&s;&s;ed by their own arguments again&s;t &s;uch mea&s;ures before they came into power. They were not a&s;hamed, however, upon this occa&s;ion, boldly to defend what they &s;o violently impugned; and at length, by the &s;trength of numbers, and not of rea&s;on, they carried their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The people now &s;aw, with indignation, their former defenders turned again&s;t them&s;elves; patrioti&s;m they began to con&s;ider as an empty name, and knew not on whom to rely, &s;ince the bolde&s;t profe&s;&s;ors of liberty were purcha&s;ed at an ea&s;y rate. But however the&s;e continen|tal mea&s;ures might injure the real intere&s;ts of the nation, they for that time &s;erved to retrieve the queen of Hungary's de&s;perate affairs. She
<PB N="298" REF="300">
&s;oon began to turn the &s;cale of victory on her &s;ide. The French were driven out of Bo|hemia. Her general, prince Charles, at the head of a large army, invaded the dominions of Bavaria. Her rival, the nominal emperor, was obliged to fly before her; and being aban|doned by his allies, and &s;tripped of even his hereditary dominions, retired to Franckfort, where he lived in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The French, who had begun as allies, were now obliged to &s;u&s;tain the whole burthen of the war, and accordingly faced their ene|mies invading them on every &s;ide of their dominions. The troops &s;ent to the queen's a&s;&s;i&s;tance by England were commanded by the earl of Stair, an experienced general, who had learned the art of war under the famous prince Eugene. The chief object which he had in view in the beginning was to effect a junction with the queen's army, command|ed by prince Charles of Lorrain, and thus to out-number the enemy in the field. The French, in order to prevent this junction, a&s;&s;embled an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men upon the river Mayne, under the command of mar&s;hal Noailles,<MILESTONE N="1743" UNIT="A.D."> who po&s;ted his troops upon the ea&s;t &s;ide of that river. The Bri|ti&s;h forces, to the number of forty thou|&s;and,
<PB N="299" REF="301">
pu&s;hed forward on the other &s;ide into a country, where they found them&s;elves entirely de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, the French having cut off all means of their being &s;upplied with any. The king of England arrived at the camp, while his army was in this deplorable &s;ituation, wherefore he re&s;olved to penetrate forward to join twelve thou&s;and Hanoverians and He&s;|&s;ians, who had reached Hannau. With this view he decamped; but before his army had marched three leagues, he found the enemy had enclo&s;ed him on every &s;ide, near a village called Dettingen.</P>
<P>Nothing now pre&s;ented but the mo&s;t morti|fying pro&s;pects; if he fought the enemy, it mu&s;t be at the greate&s;t di&s;advantage; if he continued inactive, there was a certainty of be|ing &s;tarved; and as for all retreat that was impo&s;&s;ible. The impetuo&s;ity of the French troops &s;aved his whole army. They pa&s;&s;ed a defile, which they &s;hould have been contented to guard; and under the conduct of the duke of Gramont, their hor&s;e charged the Eng|li&s;h foot with great fury. They were re|ceived, however, with intrepidity and re&s;o|lution; &s;o that they were obliged to give way, and repa&s;s the Mayne with precipi|tation, with the lo&s;s of about five thou&s;and
<PB N="300" REF="302">
men. The king of England, with great per|&s;onal courage, expo&s;ed him&s;elf to a &s;evere fire of the enemies cannon; and in the mid&s;t of the engagement encouraged his troops by his pre&s;ence and his example. The Engli&s;h had the honour of the day; but were &s;oon obliged to leave the field of battle, which was taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the French, who treated the wounded Engli&s;h with a clemency peculiar to that generous nation. Though the Engli&s;h were victorious upon this occa&s;ion, yet the earl of Stair, who was commander in chief, did not a&s;&s;ume any honour from &s;uch a vic|tory. He was unwilling to &s;hare any glory, which was &s;o precariou&s;ly obtained, and &s;natch|ed rather from the enemies mi&s;take, than gain|ed by his conduct. He therefore &s;ollicited for leave to re&s;ign, which obtaining, the troops were led into quarters, and de&s;i&s;ted from far|ther operations that campaign.</P>
<P>Mean while the French went on with vigour on every &s;ide. They oppo&s;ed prince Charles, and interrupted his attempts to pa&s;s the Rhine. They gained al&s;o &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es in Italy; but their chief hopes were placed upon a projected inva&s;ion of England. Cardinal Fleury was now dead; and cardinal Tencin, who &s;uc|ceeded him in power, was a man of a very dif|ferent
<PB N="301" REF="303">
character from his predece&s;&s;or; being proud, turbulent, and enterpri&s;ing. France, from the violence of the parliamentary di&s;|putes in England, had been per&s;uaded that the country was long ripe for a revolution, and only wanted the pre&s;ence of a pretender to bring about the change. Several needy adven|turers, who wi&s;hed for a revolution, &s;ome men of broken fortunes, and all the Roman catho|lics of the kingdom, endeavoured to confirm the court of France in the&s;e &s;entiments, of which they them&s;elves were per&s;uaded. An inva&s;ion therefore was actually projected; and Charles, the &s;on of the old pretender, de|parted from Rome in the di&s;gui&s;e of a Spa|ni&s;h courier, for Paris, where he had an au|dience of the French king.</P>
<P>This family had long been the dupes of France; but it was thought at pre&s;ent there were &s;erious re&s;olutions formed in their favour. The troops de&s;tined for the expedition a|mounted to fifteen thou&s;and men, preparations were made for embarking them at Dunkirk, and &s;ome of the neare&s;t ports to England, un|der the eye of the young pretender. The duke de Roquefuille, with twenty &s;hips of the line, was to &s;ee them &s;afely landed in Eng|land, and the famous count Saxe was to com|mand
<PB N="302" REF="304">
them, when put on &s;hore. But the whole project was di&s;concerted by the appear|ance of Sir John Norris, who, with a &s;uperior fleet, made up to attack them. The French fleet was thus obliged to put back; a very hard gale of wind damaged their tran&s;ports beyond redre&s;s; and the French, now fru|&s;trated in their &s;cheme of a &s;udden de&s;cent, thought fit openly to declare war.</P>
<P>But though fortune &s;eemed to favour Eng|land on this occa&s;ion, yet in other re&s;pects &s;he was not equally propitious. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try had &s;ent out a powerful &s;quadron of &s;hips into the Mediterranean to over-awe tho&s;e &s;tates who might be inclined to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance to France or Spain. This fleet had been con|ducted by Le&s;tock; but admiral Matthews, though a younger officer, was &s;ent out to take the &s;uperior command, which produced a mi&s;|under&s;tanding between the commanders. There was &s;oon an opportunity offered for the&s;e of|ficers to di&s;cover their mutual animo&s;ity, to the damage of their country, and their own di&s;grace. The combined fleets of France and Spain, to the number of four and thirty &s;ail, were &s;een off Toulon, and a &s;ignal was made by the Engli&s;h admiral to prepare for engag|ing. It happened that his &s;ignals were not
<PB N="303" REF="305">
perfectly exact; he had hung out that for form|ing the line of battle, which at the &s;ame time &s;hewed the &s;ignal for engaging. This was a &s;ufficient excu&s;e to Le&s;tock for refu&s;ing to come up with alacrity; &s;o that after &s;ome vain ef|forts to attack the enemy in conjunction, Matthews re&s;olved to engage as well as he could. One &s;hip of the line belonging to the Spani&s;h &s;quadron &s;truck to captain Hawke; but was next day burned by the admiral's or|der. Captain Cornwall was killed in the en|gagement, after continuing to give command, even while his leg was &s;hot off by a cannon. The pur&s;uit was continued for three days, at the end of which time Le&s;tock &s;eemed to come up with &s;ome vigour; but ju&s;t then Matthews gave orders for di&s;continuing the pur&s;uit, and &s;ailed away for Port Mahon to repair the da|mage he had &s;u&s;tained. The Engli&s;h fleet was willing to claim the victory; and the French and Spaniards were not le&s;s plea&s;ed with their own good fortune. In England, however, this di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;s was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t mortifying defeat, and the complaints of the people knew no bounds. Both admirals, upon their return, were tried by a court-martial. Matthews, who had fought with intrepidity, was declared for the future incapable of &s;erv|ing
<PB N="304" REF="306">
in his maje&s;ty's navy. Le&s;tock, who had kept at a di&s;tance, was acquitted with honour, having entrenched him&s;elf within the punctilios of di&s;cipline. He barely did his duty. A man of honour, when his country is at &s;take, &s;hould do more.</P>
<P>The proceedings of the Netherlands were as unfavourable to the Engli&s;h arms as their mo&s;t &s;anguine enemies could de&s;ire. The French had a&s;&s;embled a formidable army of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, the chief command of which was given to count Saxe, natural &s;on to the late king of Poland, and who had long been a &s;oldier of fortune. He had been bred from his youth in camps, and had &s;hewn very early in&s;tances of cool in|trepidity. He had in the beginning of the war offered his &s;ervices to &s;everal crowns; and among others, it is &s;aid, to the king of Great Britain; but his offers were rejected. By long habit this general had learned to pre&s;erve an equal compo&s;ure in the mid&s;t of battle, and &s;eemed as &s;erene in the thicke&s;t fire, as in the drawing-room at court. To oppo&s;e this great general, the Engli&s;h were headed by the duke of Cumberland, who neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch talents for war, nor was able to bring &s;uch a formidable body of men into the field.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="307">The French, therefore, bore down all before them. They be&s;ieged Fribourg, and in the be|ginning of the &s;ucceeding campaign inve&s;ted the &s;trong city of Tournay. Altho' the allies were inferior in number, and although com|manded by the duke of Cumberland, yet they re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave this city by ha|zarding a battle. They accordingly marched again&s;t the enemy, and took po&s;t in &s;ight of the French, who were encamped on an emi|nence, the village of St. Antoine on the right, a wood on the left, and the town of Fonte|noy before them. This advantageous &s;ituation did not repre&s;s the ardour of the Engli&s;h, who began the attack at two o'clock in the morn|ing, and pre&s;&s;ing forward bore down all oppo|&s;ition. They were for near an hour victorious, and confident of &s;ucce&s;s, while Saxe, who commanded the enemy, was at that time &s;ick of the &s;ame di&s;order of which he afterwards died. However he was carried about to all the po&s;ts in a litter, and a&s;&s;ured his attend|ants that, notwith&s;tanding all unfavourable appearances, the day was his own. A column of the Engli&s;h, without any command, but by mere mechanical courage, had advanced upon the enemies lines, which opening, formed an avenue on each &s;ide to receive them. It was
<PB N="306" REF="308">
then that the French artillery on three &s;ides began to play upon this forlorn body, which, though they continued for a long time un|&s;haken, were obliged at la&s;t to retreat about three in the afternoon. This was one of the mo&s;t bloody battles that had been fought in this age; the allies left on the field of battle near twelve thou&s;and men, and the French bought their victory with near an equal num|ber of &s;lain.</P>
<P>This blow, by which Tournay was taken by the French, gave them &s;uch a manife&s;t &s;u|periority all the re&s;t of the campaign, that they kept the fruits of their victory during the whole continuance of the war. The duke of Bavaria, whom they had made emperor under the title of Charles the &s;eventh, was lately dead; but though his preten&s;ions were the ori|ginal cau&s;e of the war, that by no means was di&s;continued at his decea&s;e. The grand duke of Tu&s;cany, hu&s;band to the queen of Hun|gary, was declared emperor in his room; and though the original cau&s;e of the quarrel was no more, the di&s;&s;en&s;ions &s;till continued as fierce as ever.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1745" UNIT="A.D."> But though bad &s;ucce&s;s attended the Briti&s;h arms by land and &s;ea, yet the&s;e being di&s;tant evils, the Engli&s;h &s;eemed only to complain
<PB N="307" REF="309">
from honourable motives, and murmured at di&s;tre&s;&s;es, of which they had but a very remote pro&s;pect. A civil war was now going to be kindled in their own dominions, which mixed terrors with their complaints; and which while it encrea&s;ed their perplexities, only cemented their union. The intended French inva|&s;ion had rouzed all the attention of the people, and nothing breathed throughout the whole kingdom but the de&s;truction of a popi&s;h pre|tender, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by French coun&s;els and arms. The di&s;appointment of that expedition &s;erved to encrea&s;e the hatred of the people again&s;t the pretender &s;till more, as it &s;hewed that he was willing to be made a king, even by the open enemies of his country. The people, therefore, were never &s;o ill di&s;po&s;ed to receive him, as at the very time he pitched upon to make a de&s;cent.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try was by this time changed, the lords Harrington, Che&s;terfield, and Mr. Pel|ham, being placed at the head of affairs; the&s;e enjoyed &s;ome &s;hare of popularity, and the operations of war were no longer thwarted by a turbulent oppo&s;ition. The admirals Rowley and Warren had retrieved the honour of the Briti&s;h flag, and made &s;everal rich captures at &s;ea. The fortre&s;s of Loui&s;burg, in the i&s;land of Cape Breton, on the coa&s;ts of North Ame|rica,
<PB N="308" REF="310">
a place of great con&s;equence to the Briti&s;h commerce, &s;urrendered to general Peperell, while a &s;hort time after two French Ea&s;t India &s;hips, and a Spani&s;h &s;hip from Peru, laden with trea&s;ure, put into the harbour, &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;till their own, and were taken.</P>
<P>It was at this period of returning &s;ucce&s;s, that the &s;on of the old pretender re&s;olved to make an effort for gaining the Briti&s;h crown. Charles Edward, the adventurer in que&s;tion, had been bred in a luxurious court, without par|taking in its effeminacy. He was enterprizing and ambitious; but either from experience, or natural inability, utterly unequal to the bold undertaking. He was long flattered by the ra&s;h, the &s;uper&s;titious, and the needy; he was taught to believe that the kingdom was ripe for a revolt, and that it could no longer bear the immen&s;e load of taxes with which it was burthened.</P>
<P>Being now, therefore, furni&s;hed with &s;ome money, and with &s;till larger promi&s;es from France, who fanned his ambition, he embarked for Scotland on board a &s;mall frigate, accom|panied by the marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan, and a few other de&s;perate adventurers. Thus, for the conque&s;t of the whole Briti&s;h empire, he only brought with
<PB N="309" REF="311">
him &s;even officers, and arms for two thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>Fortune, which ever per&s;ecuted his family, &s;eemed no way more favourable to him; for his convoy, a &s;hip of &s;ixty guns, was &s;o di&s;abled in an engagement with an Engli&s;hman of war, named the Lion, that it was obliged to return to Bre&s;t, while he continued his cour&s;e to the We&s;tern parts of Scotland, and landing on the coa&s;t of Lochaber,<MILESTONE N="July 27, 1745."> was in a little time joined by &s;ome chiefs of the Highland clans, and their va&s;&s;als, over whom they exerci&s;ed an he|reditary juri&s;diction. By means of the&s;e chiefs he &s;oon &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of fifteen hun|dred men, and invited others to join him by his manife&s;toes, which were di&s;per&s;ed all over the kingdom.</P>
<P>The boldne&s;s of this enterprize a&s;toni&s;hed all Europe. It awakened the fears of the pu|filanimous, the ardour of the brave, and the pity of the wi&s;e. The whole kingdom &s;eemed unanimou&s;ly bent upon oppo&s;ing an enterprize, which they were &s;en&s;ible, as being &s;upported by papi&s;ts, would be in&s;trumental in re&s;toring popery. The mini&s;try was no &s;ooner confirm|ed in the account of his arrival, which at fir&s;t they could be &s;carcely induced to credit, than
<PB N="310" REF="312">
Sir John Cope was &s;ent with a &s;mall body of forces to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time the young adventurer was ar|rived at Perth, where the unnece&s;&s;ary ceremony was performed of proclaiming his father king of Great Britain. From thence, de&s;cending with his forces from the mountains, they &s;eemed to gather as they went forward; and advancing to Edinburgh, they entered that city without oppo&s;ition. There again the pageantry of proclamation was performed; and there he promi&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve the union, which was con&s;idered as one of the grievances of the country. However, the ca&s;tle of that city &s;till held out, and he was unprovided with cannon to be&s;iege it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Sir John Cope, who had pur&s;ued the rebels through the Highlands, but had declined meeting them in their de&s;cent; being now reinforced by two regiments of dragoons, re&s;olved to march towards Edin|burgh, and give the enemy battle. The young adventurer, who&s;e forces were rather &s;uperior, though undi&s;ciplined, attacked him near Pre&s;ton Pans, about twelve miles from the capital, and in a few minutes put him and his troops to flight. This victory, by which the
<PB N="311" REF="313">
king lo&s;t five hundred men, gave the rebels great influence; and had the pretender taken advantage of the general con&s;ternation, and marched directly for England, the con&s;equence might have been fatal to freedom. But he was amu&s;ed by the promi&s;e of &s;uccours which never came; and thus induced to remain in Edinburgh, to enjoy the triumphs of a trifling victory, and to be treated as a mo|narch. By this time his train was compo&s;|ed of the earl of Kilmarnock, a man of de&s;|perate fortune, who had lately become di&s;|contented with the court for withdrawing a pen&s;ion he was granted. Lord Balmerino, who had been an officer in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, but gave up his commi&s;&s;ion, in order to join the rebels. The lords, Cromarty, Elcho, Ogilvy, Pit&s;ligo, and the elde&s;t &s;on of lord Lovat, who came in with their va&s;&s;als, and en|crea&s;ed his army. Lord Lovat him&s;elf was an enthu&s;ia&s;t in the cau&s;e; but being without prin|ciples, he was unwilling to act openly, afraid of incurring the re&s;entment of the mini&s;try, whom he &s;till dreaded. Never was there a man of &s;uch unaccountable ambition, or who ever more actively rendered him&s;elf hateful and &s;u&s;pected by all. He was at fir&s;t outlawed for ravi&s;hing the duke of Argyle's niece. He
<PB N="312" REF="314">
then offered his &s;ervice to the old pretender in France, and it was accepted. He next betray|ed the forces which were &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to queen Anne. He a &s;econd time invited the pre|tender over in the reign of George the fir&s;t, and being put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by the chevalier, of the ca&s;tle of Stirling, he once more betrayed it into the hands of the enemy. This man, true to nei|ther party, had now, in &s;ecret, &s;ent aid to the young chevalier, while, in his conver&s;ation, he affected to declaim again&s;t his attempt.</P>
<P>While the young pretender was thus trifling away his time at Edinburgh, for, in dangerous enterprizes, delay is but defeat, the mini&s;try of Great Britain took every proper precaution to oppo&s;e him with &s;ucce&s;s. Six thou&s;and Dutch troops, that had come over to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the crown, were di&s;patched northward, un|der the command of general Wade; but, as it was then &s;aid, the&s;e could lend no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as they were pri&s;oners of France upon parole, and under engagements not to oppo&s;e that power for the &s;pace of one year. However this be, the duke of Cumberland &s;oon after arrived from Flanders, and was followed by another detachment of dragoons and infantry, well di&s;|ciplined, and enured to action. Be&s;ides the&s;e, volunteers offered in every part of the king|dom;
<PB N="313" REF="315">
and every county exerted a vigorous &s;pirit of indignation both again&s;t the ambition, the religion, and the allies of the young pre|tender.</P>
<P>However, he had been bred up in a &s;chool that taught him maxims very different from tho&s;e that then prevailed in England. Tho' he might have brought civil war and all the calamities attending it with him into the king|dom, he had been taught the a&s;&s;ertion of his right was a duty incumbent upon him, and the altering the con&s;titution and perhaps the religion of his country an object of laudable ambition. Thus animated he went forward with vigour, and having, upon frequent con|&s;ultations with his officers, come to a re&s;olution of making an irrruption into England, he en|tered the country by the we&s;tern border, and inve&s;ted Carli&s;le, which &s;urrendered in le&s;s than three days. He there found a con&s;ider|able quantity of arms, and there too he pro|cured his father to be proclaimed king.</P>
<P>General Wade being apprized of his progre&s;s, advanced acro&s;s the country from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, but receiving intelligence that the enemy was two days march before him, he retired to his former &s;tation. The young pretender, therefore, thus unoppo&s;ed, re&s;olved to pene|trate
<PB N="314" REF="316">
farther into the kingdom, having receiv|ed a&s;&s;urances from France that a con&s;iderable body of troops would be landed on the &s;outh|ern coa&s;ts, to make a diver&s;ion in his favour. He was flattered al&s;o with the hopes of being joined by a con&s;iderable number of malcon|tents, as he pa&s;&s;ed forward, and that his army would encrea&s;e on the march. Accordingly, leaving a &s;mall garri&s;on in Carli&s;le, which he &s;hould rather have left defencele&s;s, he advanced to Penrith, marching on foot in an Highland dre&s;s, and continuing his irruption till he came to Manche&s;ter, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head|quarters.</P>
<P>He was there joined by about two hundred Engli&s;h, who were formed into a regiment, un|der the command of colonel Townly. From thence he pur&s;ued his march to Derby, intend|ing to go by the way of Che&s;ter into Wales, where he hoped to be joined by a great number of followers; but the factions among his own chiefs prevented his proceeding to that part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>He was by this time advanced within an hundred miles of the capital, which was filled with perplexity and con&s;ternation. Had he proceeded in his career with that expe|dition which he had hitherto u&s;ed, he might have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the metropolis,
<PB N="315" REF="317">
where he would certainly have been joined by a con&s;iderable number of his well-wi&s;hers, who waited impatiently for his approach.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king re&s;olved to take the field in per&s;on. The volunteers of the city were incorporated into a regiment; the practi|tioners of the law agreed to take the field, with the judges at their head; and even the mana|gers of the theatres offered to rai&s;e a body of their dependents for the &s;ervice of their coun|try. The&s;e a&s;&s;ociations were at once a proof of the people's fears and their loyalty; while tho&s;e concerned in the money-corporations were overwhelmed with dejection. But they found &s;afety from the di&s;contents, which now began to prevail in the pretender's army. In fact, he was but the nominal leader of his forces; as his generals, the chiefs of the High|land clans, were, from their education, ignorant, and aver&s;e to &s;ubordination. They had from the beginning begun to embrace oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tems of operation, and to contend with each other for pre-eminence; but they &s;eemed now unanimous in returning to their own country once more.</P>
<P>The rebels accordingly effected their retreat to Carli&s;le without any lo&s;s, and from thence cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scot|land. In the&s;e marches, however, they pre|&s;erved
<PB N="316" REF="318">
all the rules of war; they ab&s;tained in a great mea&s;ure from plunder, they levied con|tributions on the towns as they pa&s;&s;ed along, and with unaccountable precaution left a gar|ri&s;on in Carli&s;le, which &s;hortly after was obliged to &s;urrender to the duke of Cumberland at di&s;cretion, to the number of four hundred men.</P>
<P>The Pretender being returned to Scotland, he proceeded to Gla&s;gow, from which city he exacted &s;evere contributions. He advanced from thence to Stirling, where he was joined by lord Lewis Gordon, at the head of &s;ome forces, which had been a&s;&s;embled in his ab|&s;ence. Other clans, to the number of two thou&s;and, came in likewi&s;e; and from &s;ome &s;upplies of money, which he received from Spain, and from &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes, in which he was &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the royali&s;ts, his af|fairs began to wear a more promi&s;ing a&s;pect. Being joined by lord Drummond, he inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Stirling, commanded by general Blakeney; but the rebel forces being unu&s;ed to &s;ieges, con&s;umed much time to no purpo&s;e. It was during this attempt, that general Haw|ley, who commanded a con&s;iderable body of forces near Edinburgh, undertook to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and advanced towards the rebel army as
<PB N="317" REF="319">
far as Falkirk. After two days &s;pent in mu|tually examining each other's &s;trength, the rebels being ardent to engage, were led on in full &s;pirits to attack the king's army. The Pretender, who was in the front line, gave the &s;ignal to engage; and the fir&s;t fire put Hawley's forces into confu&s;ion. The hor&s;e retreated with precipitation, and fell upon their own infantry; while the rebels following their blow, the greate&s;t part of the royal army fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. They re|tired in confu&s;ion to Edinburgh, leaving the conquerors in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their tents, their ar|tillery, and the field of battle.</P>
<P>Thus far the affairs of the rebel army &s;eem|ed not unpro&s;perous; but here was an end of all their triumphs. The duke of Cumber|land, at that time the favourite of the Engli&s;h army, had been recalled from Flanders, and put him&s;elf at the head of the troops at Edin|burgh, which con&s;i&s;ted of about fourteen thou|&s;and men. With the&s;e he advanced to Aber|deen, where he was joined by &s;everal of the Scotch nobility, attached to the hou&s;e of Ha|nover; and having revived the drooping &s;pi|rits of his army, he re&s;olved to find out the enemy, who retreated at his approach. After having refre&s;hed his troops at Aberdeen, for
<PB N="318" REF="320">
&s;ome time he renewed his march, and in twelve days he came upon the banks of the deep and rapid river Spey. This was the place where the rebels might have di&s;puted his pa&s;&s;age, but they lo&s;t every advantage in di&s;puting with each other. They &s;eemed now totally devoid of all coun&s;el and &s;ubordination, without con|duct, and without unanimity. After a variety of conte&s;ts among each other, they re&s;olved to await their pur&s;uers upon the plains of Cullo|den, a place about nine miles di&s;tant from In|verne&s;s, embo&s;omed in hills, except on that &s;ide which was open to the &s;ea. There they drew up in order of battle, to the number of eight thou&s;and men, in three divi&s;ions, &s;up|plied with &s;ome pieces of artillery, ill manned and &s;erved.</P>
<P>The battle began about one o'clock in the afternoon; the cannon of the king's army did dreadful execution among the rebels, while theirs was totally un&s;erviceable. One of the great errors in all the pretender's warlike mea|&s;ures, was his &s;ubjecting wild and undi&s;ciplined troops to the forms of artful war, and thus repre&s;&s;ing their native ardour, from which alone he could hope for &s;ucce&s;s. After they had been kept in their ranks, and with&s;tood the Engli&s;h fire for &s;ome time, they at length be|came
<PB N="319" REF="321">
impatient for clo&s;er engagement; and about five hundred of them made an irruption upon the left wing of the enemy with their accu&s;tomed ferocity. The fir&s;t line being di&s;|ordered by this on&s;et, two battalions ad|vanced to &s;upport it, and galled the enemy with a terrible and clo&s;e di&s;charge. At the &s;ame time the dragoons, under Hawley, and the Argyle&s;hire militia pulling down a park-wall that guarded the flank of the enemy, and which they had but feebly defended, fell in among them, &s;word in hand, with great &s;laughter. In le&s;s than thirty minutes they were totally routed, and the field covered with their wounded and &s;lain, to the number of above three thou&s;and men. The French troops on the left did not fire a &s;hot, but &s;tood in|active during the engagement, and afterwards &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. An entire body of the clans marched off the field, in order, while the re&s;t were routed with great &s;laughter, and their leaders obliged with re|luctance to retire. Civil war is in it&s;elf terri|ble, but more &s;o when heightened by unne|ce&s;&s;ary cruelty. How guilty &s;oever an enemy may be, it is the duty of a brave &s;oldier to remember that he is only to fight an oppo&s;er, and not a &s;uppliant. The victory was in every
<PB N="320" REF="322">
re&s;pect deci&s;ive, and humanity to the conquer|ed would have rendered it glorious. But little mercy was &s;hewn here; the conquerors were &s;een to refu&s;e quarter to the wounded, the unarmed, and the defencele&s;s; &s;ome were &s;lain who were only excited by curio&s;ity to become &s;pectators of the combat, and &s;oldiers were &s;een to anticipate the ba&s;e employment of the executioner. The duke immediately after the action, ordered &s;ix and thirty de&s;erters to be executed, the conquer|ors &s;pread terror wherever they came; and af|ter a &s;hort &s;pace, the whole country round was one dreadful &s;cene of plunder, &s;laughter, and de&s;olation; ju&s;tice was forgotten, and ven|geance a&s;&s;umed the name.</P>
<P>In this manner were bla&s;ted all the hopes, and all the ambition of the young adventurer; one &s;hort hour deprived him of imaginary thrones and &s;ceptres, and reduced him from a nominal king, to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed forlorn outca&s;t, &s;hunned by all mankind, except &s;uch as &s;ought his de&s;truction. To the good and the brave, &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tre&s;s often atones for former guilt; and while rea&s;on would &s;peak for puni&s;hment, our hearts plead for mercy. Immediately after the engagement, he fled away with a captain of Fitzjames's cavalry, and when their hor&s;es were fatigued, they both
<PB N="321" REF="323">
alighted, and &s;eparately &s;ought for &s;afety. He for &s;ome days wandered in this country, na|turally wild, but now rendered more formid|able by war, a wretched &s;pectator of all tho&s;e horrors which were the re&s;ult of his ill-guided ambition.</P>
<P>There is a &s;triking &s;imilitude between his adventures, and tho&s;e of Charles the &s;econd, upon his e&s;cape from Worce&s;ter. He &s;ome|times found refuge in caves and cottages, with|out attendants, and dependent on the wretch|ed natives, who could pity, but not relieve him. Sometimes he lay in fore&s;ts, with one or two companions of his di&s;tre&s;s, continually pur&s;ued by the troops of the conqueror, as there was a reward of thirty thou&s;and pounds offered for taking him, dead or alive. Sheridan, an Iri&s;h adventurer, was the per&s;on who kept mo&s;t faithfully by him, and in&s;pired him with courage to &s;upport &s;uch incredible hard&s;hips. He had occa&s;ion in the cour&s;e of his concealments, to tru&s;t his life to the fideli|ty of above fifty individuals, who&s;e venera|tion for his family prevailed above their ava|rice.</P>
<P>One day, having walked from morning till night, he ventured to enter a hou&s;e, the owner of which he well knew was attached to the op|po&s;ite
<PB N="322" REF="324">
party. As he entered, he addre&s;&s;ed the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e in the following manner.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;on of your king comes to beg a little bread and a few cloaths. I know your pre|&s;ent, attachment to my adver&s;aries, but I believe you have &s;ufficient honour not to abu&s;e my confidence, or to take advantage of my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation. Take the&s;e rags that have for &s;ome time been my only cover|ing; you may probably re&s;tore them to me one day when I &s;hall be &s;eated on the throne of Great Britain."</Q>
The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was touched with pity at his di&s;tre&s;s; he a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed him as far as he was able, and never di|vulged the &s;ecret. There are few of tho&s;e who even wi&s;hed his de&s;truction, would chu&s;e to be the immediate actors in it, as it would &s;ubject them to the re&s;entment of a numerous party.</P>
<P>In this manner he continued to wander among the frightful wilds of Glengary, for near &s;ix months, often hemmed round by his pur&s;uers, but &s;till re&s;cued by &s;ome lucky accident from the impending danger. At length a privateer of St. Maloes, hired by his adherents, arrived in Lochnanach, in which he embarked in the mo&s;t wretched attire. He was clad in a &s;hort coat of black frize, thread bare, over which was a common Highland plaid, girt round him
<PB N="323" REF="325">
by a belt, from whence depended a pi&s;tol and a dagger. He had not been &s;hifted for many weeks; his eye was hollow, his vi&s;age wan, and his con&s;titution greatly impaired by famine and fatigue. He was accompanied by Sullivan and Sheridan, two Iri&s;h adherents, who had &s;hared all his calamities, together with Cameron of Lo|chiel, and his brother, and a few other exiles. They &s;et &s;ail for France, and after having been chaced by two Engli&s;h men of war, they ar|rived in &s;afety at a place called Ro&s;eau, near Morlaix in Bretagne. Perhaps he would have found it more difficult to e&s;cape, had not the vigilance of his pur&s;uers been relaxed by a re|port that he was already &s;lain.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the pretender was thus pur&s;ued, the &s;caffolds and the gibbets were preparing for his adherents. Seventeen officers of the rebel army were hanged, drawn, and quartered, at Kennington-common, in the neighbourhood of London. Their con&s;tancy in death gained more pro&s;elytes to their cau&s;e than even perhaps their victories would have obtained. Nine were executed in the &s;ame manner at Carli&s;le, and eleven at York. A few obtained pardons, and a con&s;iderable num|ber of the common men were tran&s;ported to the plantations in North America.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="326">The earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, and the lord Balmerino, were tried by their peers, and found guilty. Cromartie was par|doned, but the other two were beheaded on Tower-hill. Kilmarnock, either convinced of his errors, or flattered to the la&s;t with the hopes of pardon, declared a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his crimes, and profe&s;&s;ed his repentance. But very different was the behaviour of Balmerino, who gloried in the cau&s;e for which he fell. When his fellow-&s;ufferer was commanded to to bid God ble&s;s king George, which he did with a faint voice, Balmerino &s;till avowed his principles, and cried out aloud, <Q REND="inline">"God ble&s;s king James!"</Q> Mr. Radcliffe, brother to the late earl of Derwentwater, who was beheaded in the former reign, being taken on board a &s;hip as he was coming to reinforce the pretender's army, and the identity of his per&s;on being proved, he was &s;entenced upon a former con|viction, and &s;uffered his fate upon Tower-hill with tranquility and re&s;olution. Lord Lovat was tried and found guilty &s;ome time after; he died with great intrepidity, but his &s;ufferings did but very little honour to his cau&s;e. Thus end|ed the la&s;t effort of the family of the Stuarts for re-a&s;cending the throne; dictated by youth and pre&s;umption, and conducted with|out art or re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="327">Immediately after the rebellion was &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, and the tumult of terror and tran&s;port was &s;ub&s;ided, the legi&s;lature undertook to e&s;ta|bli&s;h &s;everal regulations in Scotland, which were equally conducive to the happine&s;s of that peo|ple, and the tranquility of the united king|dom. The Highlanders had till this time continued to wear the old military dre&s;s of their ance&s;tors, and never went without arms. In con&s;equence of this, they con&s;idered them&s;elves as a body of people di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of the nation, and were ready, upon the &s;horte&s;t notice, to &s;econd the in&s;urrections of their chiefs. But their habits were now reformed by an act of the legi&s;lature, and they were com|pelled to wear cloaths of the common fa&s;hion. But what contributed &s;till more to their real felicity, was the abolition of that hereditary juri&s;diction which their chiefs exerted over them. The power of their chieftains was to|tally de&s;troyed, and every &s;ubject in that part of the kingdom, was granted a participation of the common liberty.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while England was thus in commotion at home, the flames of war &s;till continued to rage upon the continent with encrea&s;ing violence. The French arms were crowned with repeated &s;ucce&s;s; and almo&s;t
<PB N="326" REF="328">
the whole Netherlands were reduced under their dominion. The Dutch in their u&s;ual manner negociated, &s;upplicated, and evaded the war; but they found them&s;elves every day &s;tripped of &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;trong towns which formed a barrier to their dominions, and which they had been put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by the victories of Marlborough. They now lay almo&s;t de|fencele&s;s, and ready to receive the terms of their conquerors; their national bravery be|ing quite &s;uffocated in the &s;pirit of traffic and luxury.</P>
<P>The Dutch were at this time divided by fac|tions which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and had continued for above a century in their republic. The one declared for the prince of Orange and a &s;tadt|holder, the other oppo&s;ed this election, and de|&s;ired rather friend&s;hip than to be at variance with France. The prevalence of either of the&s;e factions to its utmo&s;t extent was equally fatal to freedom; for if a &s;tadtholder were elected, the con&s;titution became altered from a repub|lic to a kind of limited monarchy; if, on the contrary, the oppo&s;ite party prevailed, the people mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the weight of a con|firmed ari&s;tocracy &s;upported by French power, and liable to its control. Of the two evils they cho&s;e the former; the people in &s;everal
<PB N="327" REF="329">
towns, inflamed almo&s;t to &s;edition, compelled their magi&s;trates to declare the prince of Orange &s;tadtholder, captain-general, and ad|miral of the United Provinces. The vigo|rous con&s;equences of this re&s;olution immedi|ately appeared. All commerce with the French was prohibited; the Dutch army was aug|mented, and orders were i&s;&s;ued to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t the French by &s;ea and land. Thus the war, which had begun but in a &s;in|gle country, was now diffu&s;ed over all Eu|rope; and like a di&s;order prevailed in differ|ent parts of this great political con&s;titution, remitting and raging by turns.</P>
<P>The king of Sardinia, who had &s;ome years before joined France again&s;t England, now changed &s;ides, and declared again&s;t the ambi|tious power of France. Italy felt all the ter|rors of inte&s;tine war, or more properly looked on, while foreigners were contending with each other for her u&s;urped dominions. The French and Spaniards on one &s;ide, and the Imperial|i&s;ts and the king of Sardinia on the other, ravaged tho&s;e beautiful territories by turns, and gave laws to a country that had once &s;pread her dominion over the world.</P>
<P>About this time the Engli&s;h made an un|&s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="328" REF="330">
attack upon Port l'Orient, a &s;ea-port in France, but weakly defended, and drew off their forces in a panic. The French gained a con&s;iderable victory at Roucroux in Flanders, although it procured them no real advantage, and co&s;t them as many lives as they de&s;troyed of the enemy. Another vic|tory, which they obtained at La Feldt, &s;erved to depre&s;s the allied army &s;till lower. But the taking of Bergen-op-zoom, the &s;tronge&s;t forti|fication of Dutch Brabant, reduced the Dutch to a &s;tate of de&s;peration. However, the&s;e victories gained by the French were counter|balanced with almo&s;t equal di&s;appointments. In Italy the mar&s;hal Belli&s;le's brother, attempt|ing to penetrate at the head of thirty-four thou&s;and men into Piedmont, was routed, and him&s;elf &s;lain. An un&s;ucce&s;sful fleet was &s;ent out for the recovery of Cape Breton. Two more were fitted out, the one to make a de&s;cent upon the Briti&s;h colonies in America, and the other to carry on the operations in the Ea&s;t Indies; but the&s;e were attacked by An&s;on and Warren, and nine of their &s;hips taken. Soon after this, com|modore Fox, with &s;ix &s;hips of war, took above forty French &s;hips richly laden from St. Do|mingo; and this lo&s;s was &s;oon after followed
<PB N="329" REF="331">
by another defeat, which the French fleet &s;u&s;|tained from admiral Hawke, in which &s;even &s;hips of the line, and &s;everal frigates, were taken.</P>
<P>In this manner victory, defeat, negociation, treachery, and rebellion, &s;ucceeded each other rapidly for &s;ome years, till all &s;ides began to think them&s;elves growing more feeble, and gaining no &s;olid advantage.</P>
<P>The Dutch had for &s;ome time endeavour|ed to &s;top the progre&s;s of a war, in which they had all to lo&s;e, and nothing to gain. The king of France was &s;en&s;ible that after a vic|tory was the mo&s;t advantageous time to offer terms of peace. He even expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of general tranquillity to Sir John Ligonier, who had been taken pri&s;oner at the battle of La Feldt. But now the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his admirals at &s;ea, his armies in Italy, the frequent bankruptcies of his merchants at home, and the election of a &s;tadtholder in Holland, who gave &s;pirit to the oppo&s;ition, all the&s;e contributed to make him weary of the war, and to propo&s;e an accommodation. This was what the allies had long wi&s;hed for; and which, notwith&s;tanding, they were a&s;hamed to demand. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try in particu|lar finding them&s;elves unable to manage a
<PB N="330" REF="332">
parliament &s;oured by frequent defeats, and now beginning to be di&s;gu&s;ted with continental connexions, were very ready to accede. A negociation was therefore re&s;olved upon; and the contending powers agreed to come to a congre&s;s at Aix-la-Chapelle, where the earl of Sandwich and Sir Thomas Robin&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted as plenipotentiaries from the king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>This treaty, which takes its name from the city at which it was made, was begun, upon the preliminary conditions of re&s;toring all con|que&s;ts made during the war. From thence great hopes were expected of conditions both favourable and honourable to the Engli&s;h; but the treaty &s;till remains a la&s;ting mark of precipitate coun&s;els, and Engli&s;h di&s;grace. By this it was agreed, that all pri&s;oners on each &s;ide &s;hould be mutually re&s;tored, and all con|que&s;ts given up. That the dutchies of Parma, Placentia, and Gua&s;talla, &s;hould be ceded to Don Philip, heir apparent to the Spani&s;h throne, and to his heirs; but in ca&s;e of his &s;ucceeding to the crown of Spain, that then the&s;e dominions &s;hould revert to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. It was confirmed that the fortifica|tions of Dunkirk to the &s;ea &s;hould be demo|li&s;hed; that the Engli&s;h &s;hip annually &s;ent
<PB N="331" REF="333">
with &s;laves to the coa&s;t of New Spain &s;hould have this privilege continued for four years. That the king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be confirmed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia, which he had lately con|quered; and that the queen of Hungary &s;hould be &s;ecured in her patrimonial dominions. But one article of the peace was more di&s;plea&s;ing and afflictive to the Engli&s;h than all the re&s;t. It was &s;tipulated that the king of Great Bri|tain &s;hould immediately, after the ratification of this treaty, &s;end two per&s;ons of rank and di&s;tinction to France as ho&s;tages, until re&s;ti|tution &s;hould be made of Cape Breton, and all other conque&s;ts which England had made during the war. This was a mortifying clau&s;e; but to add to the general error of the negociation, no mention was made of the &s;earching the ve&s;&s;els of England in the Ameri|can &s;eas, upon which the war was originally begun. The limits of their re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in North America were not a&s;certained; nor did they receive any equivalent for tho&s;e forts which they re&s;tored to the enemy. The treaty of Utrecht had long been the object of reproach to tho&s;e by whom it was made; but, with all its faults, the treaty now concluded was by far more de&s;picable and erroneous. Yet &s;uch was the &s;pirit of the times, that the treaty
<PB N="332" REF="334">
of Utrecht was branded with univer&s;al con|tempt, and the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was extolled with the highe&s;t &s;trains of prai&s;e. But the people were wearied with repeated di&s;grace, and only expecting an accumulation of misfortunes by continuing the war, they were glad of any peace that promi&s;ed a pau&s;e to their di&s;appointments.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLVIII. GEORGE II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THIS treaty, which &s;ome a&s;&s;erted would &s;erve for a bond of permanent amity, was, pro|perly &s;peaking, but a temporary truce; a ce&s;&s;ation from ho&s;tilities, which both &s;ides were unable to continue. Though the war between Eng|land and France was actually hu&s;hed up in Europe, yet in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies it &s;till went forward with dimini&s;hed vehemence. Both &s;ides &s;till willing to offend, &s;till offend|ing, and yet both complaining of the infraction.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as Europe enjoyed a temporary tranquillity, the people of England expected, and the mini&s;try was liberal in pro|mi&s;ing them, a return of all the advantages of peace. In order to plea&s;e the populace, for this mini&s;try had the art always to keep the people in good humour, a magnificent fire|work was played off; and the &s;pectators could never be brought to think that a bad treaty, which was celebrated with &s;uch magnificent profu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="336">It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed al&s;o there was &s;ome de|&s;ire &s;hewn in the mini&s;try to promote the com|merce of the kingdom; and for this purpo&s;e a bill was pa&s;&s;ed for encouraging a Briti&s;h her|ring fi&s;hery, in the manner of that carried on by the Dutch, under proper regulations. From the carrying &s;uch a &s;cheme vigorou&s;ly into execution, great advantages were ex|pected. The Dutch, who had long enjoyed the &s;ole profits ari&s;ing from this article, con|&s;idered the &s;ea as a mine of inexhau&s;tible wealth. But the patience and frugality of that nation &s;eem to fit them more properly for the life of fi&s;hermen than the Engli&s;h. Cer|tain it is that experience has &s;hewn this at|tempt to rival the Dutch to have been ineffec|tual. Perhaps the company was not e&s;tabli&s;h|ed upon the &s;tricte&s;t principles of oeconomy; perhaps the Dutch art of curing their fi&s;h was not practi&s;ed or under&s;tood perfectly.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Pelham, who now conducted the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, and was e&s;teemed a man of candour and capacity, laid a &s;cheme for lightening the immen&s;e load of debt which the nation &s;u&s;tained in con&s;equence of the late war. His plan was to le&s;&s;en the debt, by lowering the intere&s;t which had been promi&s;ed on granting the &s;upplies, or el&s;e
<PB N="335" REF="337">
obliging the lenders to receive the &s;ums origi|nally granted. Tho&s;e, for in&s;tance, who were proprietors of &s;tock, and received for the u&s;e of their money four per cent. were, by an act pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, compelled to &s;ub&s;cribe their names, &s;ignifying their con&s;ent to accept of three pounds ten &s;hillings per cent. the following year, and three per cent. every year en&s;uing; and in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, a&s;&s;urances were given that the government would pay off the principal. This &s;cheme was attended with the de&s;ired effect, though it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, was a force upon the lender, who had origi|nally granted his money upon different terms, and under a promi&s;e of continuing intere&s;t. However, the mea&s;ure was evidently benefi|cial to the nation; and experience has &s;hewn that it no way affected the public credit. Be|&s;ide this &s;alutary mea&s;ure others were pur&s;ued for the intere&s;t of the nation with equal &s;uc|ce&s;s. The importation of iron from America was allowed, the trade to Africa was laid open to the nation, but under the &s;uperintendance of the board of trade.</P>
<P>But all the advantages the nation reaped from the&s;e &s;alutary mea&s;ures were not &s;uffi|cient to counterbalance the &s;troke which li|berty received, as &s;ome are of opinion, by an
<PB N="336" REF="338">
unu&s;ual &s;tretch of the privileges of the hou&s;e of commons. The city of We&s;tmin&s;ter had long been repre&s;ented by members who were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, appointed by the mini&s;try. Lord Trentham, member for We&s;tmin&s;ter, having vacated his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of com|mons, by accepting a place under the crown, again re&s;olved to &s;tand candidate, and met with a violent oppo&s;ition. It was objected by &s;ome that he had been uncommonly active in introducing &s;ome French &s;trollers, who had come over by the invitation of the nobility to open a theatre when our own were &s;hut up. This accu&s;ation again&s;t him excited a violent combination, who &s;tyled them&s;elves the Independent Electors of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and who named Sir George Vandeput, a private gentle|man, as his competitor. The&s;e re&s;olved to &s;upport their own nomination at their own expence, and accordingly opened hou&s;es of entertainment for the inferior voters, and pro|pagated abu&s;e as u&s;ual. At length the pole being clo&s;ed, the majority appeared to be in favour of lord Trentham; but a &s;crutiny be|ing demanded by the other party, it was pro|tracted by management on the one &s;ide, and tumult on the other. After &s;ome time the &s;crutiny al&s;o appeared in favour of lord Trent|ham,
<PB N="337" REF="339">
the independent electors complained of partiality and inju&s;tice in the high-bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who took the poll, and carried their petition to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>To this petition the hou&s;e paid little atten|tion; but proceeded to examine the high-bai|liff as to the cau&s;es that had &s;o long protracted the election. This officer laid the blame upon Mr. Crowle, who had acted as coun&s;el for the petitioners, and al&s;o upon the honourable Alexander Murray, a friend to Sir George Vandeput, and one Gib&s;on, an uphol&s;terer. The&s;e three per&s;ons were, therefore, brought to the bar of the hou&s;e; Crowle and Gib&s;on con&s;ented to a&s;k pardon, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, upon being reprimanded by the &s;peaker. Mur|ray was at fir&s;t admitted to bail; but upon the depo&s;ition of &s;everal witne&s;&s;es that he had headed a mob to intimidate the voters, it was re&s;olved by the hou&s;e that he &s;hould be com|mitted a clo&s;e pri&s;oner to Newgate, and that he &s;hould receive this &s;entence at the bar of the hou&s;e upon his knees. When he was con|ducted before the hou&s;e, being directed to kneel, he refu&s;ed to comply, and this threw the whole a&s;&s;embly into commotion. They then were re&s;olved to pur&s;ue more vigorous mea&s;ures; ordered that he &s;hould be com|mitted
<PB N="338" REF="340">
to Newgate, denied the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper, and that no per&s;on &s;hould have ac|ce&s;s to him, without permi&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This impri&s;onment he underwent with great chearfulne&s;s, &s;en&s;ible that, by the con&s;titution of the country, his confinement could con|tinue no longer than while the commons con|tinued &s;itting; and at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion he was accordingly di&s;charged. But what was his amazement, at the commencement of the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion, to find that he was was again called upon, and that a motion was made for committing him clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower. The delinquent, therefore, thought proper to &s;creen him&s;elf from their re&s;entment by ab|&s;conding; but the people could not help con&s;idering their repre&s;entatives rather as their oppre&s;&s;ors, and the hou&s;e as a&s;&s;erting rather vindictive, than legi&s;lative autho|rity. Some thought they &s;aw in this mea|&s;ure the &s;eeds of a future ari&s;tocracy; that the commons erected them&s;elves into a tri|bunal, where they determined on their own privileges, and ready to puni&s;h, without the con&s;ent of the other parts of the legi&s;lature. However, the &s;ubject has &s;till one re&s;ource again&s;t any violent re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e again&s;t him; he may re&s;i&s;t if he thinks proper,
<PB N="339" REF="341">
as they are armed with no legal executive powers to compel obedience.</P>
<P>The people were &s;carce recovered from the re&s;entment produced by this mea&s;ure, when another was taken in the hou&s;e, which, in reality, made di&s;tinctions among the people, and laid a line between the rich and poor that &s;eemed impa&s;&s;able. This was the act for the better preventing clande&s;tine marriages, and for the more public &s;olemnization of that ceremony. The grievance complained of, and which this law was calculated to redre&s;s, was, that the &s;ons and daughters of opulent families were often &s;educed into marriage be|fore they had acquired &s;ufficient experience in life, to be &s;en&s;ible of the de&s;parity of the match. This &s;tatute, therefore, enacted, that the bans of marriage &s;hould be regularly publi&s;hed three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Sundays in the church of the pari&s;h where both parties had re&s;ided for one month, at lea&s;t, before the ceremony. It de|clared, that any marriage &s;olemnized without this previous publication, or a licen&s;e obtain|ed from the bi&s;hop's court, &s;hould be void, and that the per&s;on who &s;olemnized it &s;hould be tran&s;ported for &s;even years. This act was at that time thought replete with con&s;equences injurious to &s;ociety; and experience has con|firmed
<PB N="340" REF="342">
the truth of many of tho&s;e objections. Infamous men have made a practice of &s;edu|cing young women, ignorant of the law, by pretending a marriage which they knew to be illegal, and con&s;equently no longer binding. The poor, by being prevented from making alliances with the rich, have left wealth to flow in its ancient channels, and thus to accumulate, contrary to the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate. It has been found to impede marriage, by clogging it with unnece&s;&s;ary ceremonies. Some have affirmed that lewdne&s;s and debauchery have become more frequent &s;ince the enacting this law, and it is believed that the numbers of the people are upon the decline.</P>
<P>This &s;e&s;&s;ion was al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by ano|ther act equally unpopular, and perhaps equally injurious to that religion which was &s;till left a|mong the populace. This was a law for natura|lizing the Jews. The mini&s;try boldly affirmed, that &s;uch a law would greatly contribute to the benefit of the nation; that it would encrea&s;e the wealth, the credit, and the commerce of the kingdom, and &s;et a laudable example of political toleration. Others, however, were of different &s;entiments; they &s;aw greater favour was &s;hewn to the Jews by this bill, than to &s;ome other &s;ects profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity; that
<PB N="341" REF="343">
an introduction of this people into the king|dom would di&s;grace the character of the na|tion, and cool the zeal of the natives for re|ligion, which was already too much neglected. The bill was pa&s;&s;ed into a law; but the people without doors remon&s;trated &s;o loudly again&s;t it, that the mini&s;try were obliged to get it re|pealed the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>An act equally unpopular with the two for|mer was now al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, which contained regu|lations for the better pre&s;erving the game. By this, none but men already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;tated fortune were allowed a privilege of carrying a gun, or de&s;troying game, though even upon the grounds which he him&s;elf rented and paid for. This law was but of very little &s;ervice to the community; it totally damped all that martial ardour among the lower orders of man|kind, by preventing their handling tho&s;e arms, which might one day be nece&s;&s;ary to defend their country. It al&s;o defeated its own end of pre&s;erving the game; for the farmers, abridg|ed of the power of &s;eizing game, never per|mitted it to come to maturity.</P>
<P>A &s;cheme,<MILESTONE N="174" UNIT="A.D."> which the nation was taught to believe would be extremely advantageous, had been entered upon &s;ome time before. This was the encouraging tho&s;e who had been di&s;|charged
<PB N="342" REF="344">
the army or navy, to become &s;ettlers in a new colony in North America, in the pro|vince of Nova Scotia. To this retreat it was thought the wa&s;te of an exuberant nation might well be drained off; and tho&s;e bold &s;pi|rits kept in employment at a di&s;tance, who might be dangerous, if &s;uffered to continue in idlene&s;s at home. Nova Scotia was a place where men might be impri&s;oned, but not main|tained; it was cold, barren, and incapable of &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation. The new colony, there|fore, was maintained there with &s;ome expence to the government in the beginning; and &s;uch as were permitted, &s;oon went &s;outhward to the milder climates, where they were invited by an untenanted and fertile &s;oil. Thus did the nation ungratefully &s;end off her hardy veterans to peri&s;h on inho&s;pitable &s;hores, and this they were taught to believe would extend their dominion.</P>
<P>However, it was for this barren &s;pot that the Engli&s;h and French revived the war, which &s;oon after &s;pread with &s;uch terrible deva&s;tation over every part of the globe. The native Indians bordering upon the de&s;arts of Nova Scotia, a fierce and &s;avage people, looked from the fir&s;t with jealou&s;y upon the&s;e new &s;ettlers; and they con&s;idered the vicinity of the Eng|li&s;h
<PB N="343" REF="345">
as an encroachment upon their native po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The French, who were neighbours in like manner, and who were &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with national animo&s;ity, fomented the&s;e &s;u&s;|picions in the natives, and repre&s;ented the Engli&s;h, and with regard to this colony the re|pre&s;entation might be true, as enterprizing and &s;evere. Commi&s;&s;aries were, therefore, appoint|ed to meet at Paris, to compromi&s;e the&s;e di&s;putes; but the&s;e conferences were rendered abortive by the cavillings of men, who could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the &s;ubject in debate.</P>
<P>As this &s;eemed to be the fir&s;t place where the di&s;&s;en&s;ions took their ri&s;e for a new war, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to be a little more minute. The French had been the fir&s;t cultivators of Nova Scotia, and, by great indu&s;try and long per&s;eve|rance, had rendered the &s;oil, naturally barren, &s;omewhat more fertile, and capable of &s;u&s;tain|ing nature, with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Europe. This country, however, had frequently chan|ged ma&s;ters, until at length the Engli&s;h were &s;ettled in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and acknowledged as the rightful owners, by the treaty of Utrecht. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this country was reckoned nece&s;&s;ary to defend the Engli&s;h colonies to the North, and to pre&s;erve their &s;uperiority in the
<PB N="344" REF="346">
fi&s;heries in that part of the world. The French, however, who had been long &s;ettled in the back parts of the country, re&s;olved to u&s;e every method to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the new-comers, and &s;pirited up the Indians to more open ho&s;tilities, which were repre&s;ented to the Eng|li&s;h mini&s;try for &s;ome time without redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after this, another &s;ource of di&s;pute began to be &s;een in the &s;ame part of the world, and promi&s;ed as much unea&s;ine&s;s as the for|mer. The French pretending fir&s;t to have di&s;covered the mouth of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, claimed the whole adjacent country towards New Mexico on the Ea&s;t, and quite to the Apalachian mountains on the We&s;t. In order to a&s;&s;ert their claims, as they found &s;e|veral Engli&s;h, who had &s;ettled beyond the&s;e mountains, from motives of commerce, and al&s;o invited by the natural beauties of the country, they di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their new &s;ettlements, and built &s;uch forts as would command the whole country round about. It was now, therefore, &s;een, that their intention was to &s;urround the Engli&s;h colonies, which lay along the &s;hore, by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the internal parts of the country that lay on the back of our &s;ettlements; and thus, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion already of the northern and &s;outhern
<PB N="345" REF="347">
parts of that great continent, to hem the Eng|li&s;h in on every &s;ide, and &s;ecure to them&s;elves all trade with the natives of the internal part of the country. The Engli&s;h, therefore, ju&s;tly apprehended, that if the French united their northern colonies, which were traded into by the river St. Lawrence, to their &s;outhern, which were acce&s;&s;ible by the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, that then they mu&s;t in a &s;hort time become ma&s;ters of the whole country; and by having a wide extended territory to range in, they would &s;oon multiply, and become every day more powerful.</P>
<P>Negociations had long been carried on to determine the&s;e differences; but what could rea&s;on avail in determining di&s;putes where there were no certain principles to be guided by? The limits of tho&s;e countries had never been &s;ettled; for they were before this time too remote, or too in&s;ignificant, to employ much attention. It was not probable that powers, who had no right to the countries in di&s;pute, but that of inva&s;ion, would have equity enough to agree among them&s;elves in &s;haring the &s;poil.</P>
<P>But not in America alone, but al&s;o in A&s;ia, the &s;eeds of a new war were preparing to be expanded. On the coa&s;ts of Malabar, the
<PB N="346" REF="348">
Engli&s;h and French had, in fact, never cea&s;ed from ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>This immen&s;e tract of country, which now &s;aw the armies of Europe contending for its, do|minion, comprehends the whole Penin&s;ula of India proper. On the coa&s;ts of this country, the Engli&s;h, the French, and &s;everal other powers of Europe, had built forts, with the original con&s;ent of the Mogul, who was then emperor of the whole tract. The war between the Engli&s;h and French there, fir&s;t began by either power &s;iding with two contending princes of the country, and from being &s;econdaries in the quarrel at length becoming principals. Thus the war was kindled up in every part of the world. Mo&s;t other national conte&s;ts have ari&s;en from &s;ome principal cau&s;e; but this war &s;eems to have been produced by the concur|rence of &s;everal, or it may be more properly con&s;idered as the continuance of the late war, which was never effectually extingui&s;hed by the wretched and defective treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</P>
<P>The government of England had long com|plained of the&s;e infractions, and the&s;e produc|ed only recrimination; the two powers were negociating, accu&s;ing, and de&s;troying each other at the &s;ame time. At length, the mini&s;try
<PB N="347" REF="349">
were re&s;olved to cut the knot, which they could not unloo&s;e, and to act at once in open defi|ance of the enemy. Orders were accordingly di&s;patched to all the governors of the Ameri|can provinces to unite into a confederacy for their mutual &s;ecurity; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the Indians over to e&s;pou&s;e their quarrel. But this was a mea&s;ure which, by long neglect, was now become impracticable. It had long been the method of the Engli&s;h to cultivate the friend&s;hip of this fierce and hardy race in times of danger; but to &s;light it in circum&s;tan|ces of &s;afety. This &s;erved to alienate the af|fections of the Indians from the Engli&s;h go|vernment; but the avarice of our merchants, particularly of that called the Ohio company, who &s;old them bad commodities, and treated them with perfidy and in&s;olence, &s;erved to confirm their aver&s;ion. Be&s;ide, there was &s;omething in the di&s;po&s;ition of the French adventurers in tho&s;e regions more &s;imilar to theirs. They were hardy, enterprizing, and poor. The Indians, therefore, naturally joined tho&s;e allies, from the conque&s;t of whom in ca&s;e of enmity, they could expect no plunder; and they declared war again&s;t the Engli&s;h &s;et|tlers, who were rich, frugal, and laborious, and who&s;e &s;poils were therefore worth wi&s;hing for.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="350">In this manner the Engli&s;h had not only the French, but almo&s;t the whole body of the Indian nations to contend with; but what was &s;till wor&s;e, their own contentions among each other rendered their &s;ituation yet more deplorable. Some of the Engli&s;h provinces, who, from their &s;ituation, had little to fear from the enemy, or few advantages to expect from &s;ucce&s;s, declined furni&s;hing their &s;hare of the &s;upplies. At the &s;ame time the gover|nors of &s;ome other colonies, who had been men of broken fortunes, and had left England in hopes of retrieving their lo&s;t circum&s;tances by rapacity abroad, became &s;o odious, that the colonies refu&s;ed to lend any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when &s;uch men were to have the management.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es, therefore, of the French in the beginning were flattering and uninterrupted. There had been for &s;ome time frequent &s;kir|mi&s;hes between their troops, and tho&s;e of the government of England. They had fought with general Lawrence to the North, and co|lonel Wa&s;hington to the South, and come off mo&s;t commonly victorious. It is unnece&s;&s;ary, however, to tran&s;mit the&s;e trifling details to po&s;terity, or to load the page with barbarous names, and unimportant marches. It may be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the two nations &s;eemed
<PB N="349" REF="351">
to have imbibed a part of the &s;avage fury of tho&s;e with whom they fought, and excerci&s;ed various cruelties, either from a &s;pirit of ava|rice or revenge.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, however, in England began now a very vigorous exertion in defence of tho&s;e colonies, who refu&s;ed to defend them|&s;elves. Four operations were undertaken in America at the &s;ame time. Of the&s;e,<MILESTONE N="175" UNIT="A.D."> one was commanded by colonel Monckton, who had orders to drive the French from the encroach|ments upon the province of Nova Scotia. The &s;econd, more to the South, was directed again&s;t Crown-point, under the command of general John&s;on. The third, under the con|duct of general Shirley, was de&s;tined to Niaga|ra, to &s;ecure the forts on the river; and the fourth was farther &s;outhward &s;till, again&s;t Fort Du Que&s;ne, under general Braddock.</P>
<P>In the&s;e expeditions Monckton was &s;ucce&s;s|ful; John&s;on al&s;o was victorious, tho' he failed in taking the fort again&s;t which he was &s;ent; Shirley was thought to have lo&s;t the &s;ea&s;on for operation by delay; Braddock was vigorous and active, but &s;uffered a defeat. This bold commander, who had been recommended to this &s;ervice by the duke of Cumberland, &s;et forward upon his expedition in June, and left the cultivated parts of the country on the tenth,
<PB N="350" REF="352">
at the head of two thou&s;and two hundred men, directing his march to that part of the country where general Wa&s;hington had been defeated the year before. Upon his arrival, he was there informed that the French at Fort du Que&s;ne, again&s;t which he was de&s;tined, expect|ed a reinforcement of five hundred men, and would then become his equals in the field; he therefore re&s;olved with all ha&s;te to advance and attack them, before they became too powerful by this conjunction. In con&s;equence of this re|&s;olution, leaving colonel Dunbar with eight hun|dred men to bring up the provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and heavy baggage, as quick as the nature of the &s;ervice would admit, he marched forward with the re&s;t of his army, through a country that &s;till remained in primaeval wildne&s;s, &s;olitary and hideous, inhabited only by bea&s;ts, and hunters &s;till more formidable. However, he went forward with intrepidity, and &s;oon found him&s;elf advanced into the de&s;arts of Of|wego, where no European had ever been. But his courage was greater than his caution; regardle&s;s of the de&s;igns of the enemy, he took no care previou&s;ly to explore the woods or the thickets, as if the nearer he approached the enemy, the le&s;s regardle&s;s he became of dan|ger. Being at length within ten miles of the fortre&s;s, he was appointed to be&s;iege, and
<PB N="351" REF="353">
marching forward through the fore&s;ts with full confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, on a &s;udden his whole army was a&s;toni&s;hed by a general di&s;charge of arms, both in front and flank, from an enemy that &s;till remained un&s;een. It was now too late to think of retreating, the troops had pa&s;&s;ed into the defile, which the enemy had artfully permitted them to do before they offered to fire. The vanguard of the Engli&s;h now, there|fore, fell back in con&s;ternation upon the main body, and the panic &s;oon became general. The officers alone di&s;dained to fly, while Brad|dock him&s;elf &s;till continued to command his brave a&s;&s;ociates, di&s;covering at once the great|e&s;t intrepidity and the greate&s;t imprudence. An enthu&s;ia&s;t to the di&s;cipline of war, he di&s;|dained to fly from the field, or to permit his men to quit their ranks when their only me|thod of treating the Indian army, was by a precipitate attack, or an immediate de&s;ertion of the field of battle. At length Braddock, having received a mu&s;quet-&s;hot through the lungs, he dropped, and a total confu&s;ion en|&s;ued. All the artillery, ammunition, and bag|gage of the army were left to the enemy; and the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h army might amount to &s;even hundred men. The &s;hattered remains of the army, &s;oon after join|ing
<PB N="352" REF="354">
colonel Dunbar, returned by their former route, and arrived to &s;pread the ge|neral con&s;ternation among the provincials of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The general indignation that was rai&s;ed by the&s;e defeats, drove the Engli&s;h into a &s;pirit of retaliation by &s;ea, where they were &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. Orders were, therefore, given to make prize of the French &s;hipping wherever found, though they had yet publi&s;hed no formal de|claration of war. With this order, the naval commanders very readily and willingly com|plied; the French merchant &s;hips were taken in &s;everal places, and &s;oon the Engli&s;h ports were filled with ve&s;&s;els taken from the enemy, and kept as an indemnification for tho&s;e forts of which the enemy had unju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in America. The benefit of this mea&s;ure, was much more obvious than its ju&s;tice; it &s;truck &s;uch a blow that the French navy was unable to recover it&s;elf during the continuance of the war, which was formally declared on both &s;ides &s;hortly after.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX. GEORGE II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THE war between the two nations being thus begun, and all negociation at an end, both nations made vigorous preparations, both to annoy, and to intimidate each other. In this the French were mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, and for a long time had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee not only &s;ucce&s;s attend their arms, but di&s;content and faction dividing the coun&s;els of their opponents. Their fir&s;t attempt was by inti|midating England with the threats of a for|midable inva&s;ion. Several bodies of their troops had for &s;ome time been &s;ent down to the coa&s;ts that lay oppo&s;ite the Briti&s;h &s;hores, the&s;e were in&s;tructed in the di&s;cipline of em|barking and re-landing from flat-bottomed boats, which were made in great numbers for that expedition. The number of men de&s;tin|ed for this enterprize, amounted to fifty thou|&s;and, but they di&s;covered the utmo&s;t reluct|ance to the undertaking, and it was by de|grees that the French mini&s;try hoped to pre|vail upon them to proceed. Every day they
<PB N="354" REF="356">
were exerci&s;ed with embarking and di&s;embark|ing, while numbers of new flat-bottomed boats were continually added.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e preparations were intended for actual de&s;cent, or made only to terrify the Engli&s;h, is as yet uncertain, but it is manife&s;t that they an&s;wered the latter intent entirely. The people of England &s;aw them&s;elves ex|po&s;ed without arms, leaders, or di&s;cipline, to the de&s;igns of their enemies, governed by a mi|ni&s;try that was timid, unpopular, and divided among them&s;elves. It was in this exigence that they applied to the Dutch for &s;ix thou&s;and men, which they were obliged to furni&s;h by treaty in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion. However, the Dutch re|fu&s;ed the &s;upply, alledging that their treaty was to &s;upply troops in ca&s;e of an actual, and not a threatened inva&s;ion. The king, there|fore, finding that he could not have the Dutch forces until their a&s;&s;i&s;tance would be too late, de&s;i&s;ted entirely from his demand, and the Dutch, with great amity, returned him thanks for withdrawing his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, di&s;appointed of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, looked round the continent to find where they might at any rate make a demand. The aid of a body of He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians, a|mounting to about ten thou&s;and men, was to be purcha&s;ed; and the&s;e the mini&s;try brought
<PB N="355" REF="357">
over into England to protect about as many millions of Engli&s;hmen, who were &s;uppo&s;ed in|capable of defending them&s;elves. But here the remedy appeared to the people wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. The mini&s;try was reviled for hav|ing reduced the nation to &s;uch a di&s;graceful conde&s;cen&s;ion. The people con&s;idered them|&s;elves as no way reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing &s;uch feeble aid. They only de|manded a vigorous exertion of their own in|ternal &s;trength, and feared no force that could be led to invade them.</P>
<P>The&s;e murmurs, fears, and di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the Engli&s;h, gave the French an opportunity of carrying on their de&s;igns on another quarter; and while the mini&s;try were employed in guarding again&s;t the neighbouring terrors, they were attacked in the Mediterranean, where they ex|pected no danger. The i&s;land of Minorca, which we had taken from the Spaniards in the reign of queen Anne, was &s;ecured to Eng|land by repeated treaties. But the mini&s;try, at this time being blinded by dome&s;tic terrors, had neglected to take &s;ufficient precautions for its defence, &s;o that the garri&s;on was weak, and no way fitted to &s;tand a vigorous &s;iege. The French, therefore landed near the fortifica|tion of St. Philip's, which was reckoned one of
<PB N="356" REF="358">
the &s;tronge&s;t in Europe, and commanded by general Blakeney, who was brave indeed, but rather &s;uperannuated. The &s;iege was carried on with great vigour, and for &s;ome time as ob|&s;tinately defended on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try being apprized of this unex|pected attack, re&s;olved to rai&s;e the &s;iege if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ent out admiral Byng with ten &s;hips of war, with orders to relieve Minorca at any rate. Byng accordingly &s;ailed from Gibraltar, where he was refu&s;ed any a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men from the governor of that garri&s;on, under a pretence that his own fortification was in danger. Upon his approaching the i&s;land, he &s;oon &s;aw the French banners di&s;played upon the &s;hore, and the Engli&s;h colours &s;till flying on the ca&s;tle of St. Philip. He had been or|dered to throw a body of troops into the garri&s;on; but this he thought too hazardous an undertaking; nor did he even make an at|tempt. While he was thus deliberating be|tween his fears and his duty, his attention was quickly called off by the appearance of a French fleet, that &s;eemed of nearly equal force to his own. Confounded by a variety of mea&s;ures he &s;eemed re&s;olved to pur&s;ue none, and therefore gave orders to form the line of battle, and act upon the defen&s;ive.
<PB N="357" REF="359">
Byng had been long prai&s;ed for his &s;kill in na|val tactics; and, perhaps, valuing mo&s;t tho&s;e talents for which he was mo&s;t prai&s;ed, he &s;a|crificed all claims to courage to the applau&s;e for naval di&s;cipline. The French fleet ad|vanced, a part of the Engli&s;h fleet engaged, the admiral &s;till kept aloof, and gave very plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for not coming into action. The French fleet, therefore, &s;lowly &s;ailed away, and no other opportunity ever offered of coming to a clo&s;er engagement.</P>
<P>This caution was carried rather beyond the proper bounds; but a council of war, which was &s;oon after called on board the admiral's own &s;hip, deprived the Engli&s;h garri&s;on of all hopes of &s;uccour. It was there determined to &s;ail away to Gibraltar to refit the fleet, and it was agreed that the relief of Minorca was become impracticable.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the re&s;entment of the nation upon being informed of Byng's con|duct. The mini&s;try were not aver&s;e to throw|ing from them&s;elves the blame of tho&s;e mea|&s;ures which were attended with &s;uch indiffer|ent &s;ucce&s;s, and they &s;ecretly fanned the flame. The news, which &s;oon after arrived, of the &s;urrender of the garri&s;on to the French, drove the general ferment almo&s;t to frenzy. In the
<PB N="358" REF="360">
mean time Byng continued at Gibraltar, quite &s;atisfied with his own conduct, and little ex|pecting the dreadful &s;torm that was gathering again&s;t him at home. Orders, however, were &s;oon &s;ent out for putting him under an arre&s;t, and for carrying him to England. Upon his arrival he was committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody in Greenwich ho&s;pital, and &s;ome arts u&s;ed to enflame the populace again&s;t him, who want no incentives to injure and condemn their &s;uperiors. Several addre&s;&s;es were &s;ent up from different counties, demanding ju&s;tice on the delinquent, which the mini&s;try were willing to &s;econd. He was &s;oon after tried by a court-martial in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, where, after a trial, which continued &s;everal days, his judges were agreed that he had not done his utmo&s;t during the engagement to de&s;troy the enemy, and therefore they ad|judged him to &s;uffer death by the twelfth ar|ticle of war. At the &s;ame time, however, they recommended him as an object of mercy, as they con&s;idered his conduct rather as the effects of error, than of cowardice. By this &s;entence they expected to &s;atisfy at once the re&s;entment of the nation, and yet &s;creen them|&s;elves from con&s;cious &s;everity. The govern|ment was re&s;olved upon &s;hewing him no mercy;
<PB N="359" REF="361">
the parliament was applied to in his favour; but they found no circum&s;tances in his con|duct that could invalidate the former &s;entence. Being thus abandoned to his fate, he main|tained to the la&s;t a degree of fortitude and &s;e|renity, that no way betrayed any timidity or cowardice. On the day fixed for his execu|tion, which was on board a man of war in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, he advanced from the cabbin, where he had been impri&s;oned, upon deck, the place appointed for him to &s;uffer. After delivering a paper, containing the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;ertions of his innocence, he came forward to the place where he was to kneel down, and for &s;ome time per&s;i&s;ted in not covering his face; but his friends repre|&s;enting that his looks would po&s;&s;ibly intimi|date the &s;oldiers who were to &s;hoot him, and prevent their taking proper aim, he had his eyes bound with an handkerchief; and then giving the &s;ignal for the &s;oldiers to fire, he was killed in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. There appears &s;ome &s;everity in Byng's puni&s;hment; but it certainly produced &s;oon after very beneficial effects to the nation.</P>
<P>In the mean time the French, who were now ma&s;ters of Minorca, were willing to &s;e|cond their blow by an attack upon a country,
<PB N="360" REF="362">
which they were &s;en&s;ible the king of England valued &s;till more. Being convinced that they could not hold their acqui&s;itions again&s;t &s;uch a &s;uperiority as the Engli&s;h were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at &s;ea, and the numberle&s;s re&s;ources they had of a&s;&s;i&s;ting their colonies with all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of war; they made no &s;cruple of declaring that they would revenge all injuries which they &s;hould &s;u&s;tain in their colonies upon the king of England's territories in Ger|many; a threat, which they &s;ecretly believed would &s;oon compel the Engli&s;h mini&s;try to ac|cept of &s;uch terms as they &s;hould be plea&s;ed to offer. Or, in ca&s;e of per&s;everance, they knew that it would divide the Engli&s;h forces, and lead them to a country, where they mu&s;t be manife&s;tly inferior. In the&s;e hopes they were not much di&s;appointed. The court of London, dreading the con&s;equences of their indignation, and eager to procure the &s;ecurity of Hanover, entered into a very expen&s;ive treaty with the court of Ru&s;&s;ia, by which it was &s;tipulated that a body of fifty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians &s;hould be ready to act in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, in ca&s;e Hanover &s;hould be invaded; and for this the czarina was to receive an hun|dred thou&s;and pounds annually, to be paid in advance.</P>
<P><PB N="361" REF="363">This treaty with the Ru&s;&s;ians, which was con&s;idered as a ma&s;ter &s;troke of politics by the mini&s;try in England, &s;oon appeared to be as nugatory as it was expen&s;ive. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia had long con&s;idered him&s;elf as guar|dian of the intere&s;ts of Germany, and was &s;tartled at a treaty, which threatened to de|luge the empire with an army of barbarians. This monarch, who&s;e talents were well known even at that time, but who has &s;ince become &s;o famous, had learned by his &s;agacity to pre|vent the de&s;igns of his enemies, while yet be|ginning, and to repre&s;s them by his courage when they were begun. He, therefore, took the fir&s;t opportunity to declare that he would not &s;uffer any foreign forces to enter the em|pire, either as auxiliaries, or as principals. This con&s;ummate politician had, it &s;eems, been already apprized of a &s;ecret negociation be|tween the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Au&s;trians, by which the latter were to enter the empire, and &s;trip him of his late conque&s;ts of Sile&s;ia. Thus England was but the dupe of Ru&s;&s;ian poli|tics; &s;he paid them a large &s;ub&s;idy for enter|ing the empire, which they had already deter|mined to perform without her commands.</P>
<P>The king of England, who&s;e fears for Ha|nover guided all his coun&s;els, now &s;aw him|&s;elf
<PB N="362" REF="364">
in the &s;ituation he mo&s;t dreaded. His na|tive dominions were now expo&s;ed to the re|&s;entment not only of France, but of Pru&s;&s;ia; and either of the&s;e was &s;ufficient at once to over-run and ravage his electorate, while the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ub&s;idies were at too great a di&s;tance to lend him the &s;malle&s;t relief. Treaties were once more &s;et on foot to lend a precarious &s;e|curity; and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was applied to, in hopes of turning his re&s;entment another way. All that the king of England wi&s;hed for was to keep a foreign enemy from invading Germany, and this the king of Pru&s;&s;ia pro|fe&s;&s;ed to de&s;ire with equal ardour. From this &s;imilitude of intention, the&s;e two monarchs were induced to unite their intere&s;ts; and as they were both in&s;pired with the &s;ame wi&s;h, they &s;oon came to an agreement, by which they promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other, and to pre|vent all foreign armies from entering the em|pire.</P>
<P>From this new alliance both powers hoped great advantages. Be&s;ide pre&s;erving the in|dependence of the German &s;tates, which was the o&s;ten&s;ible object, each had their peculiar benefits in view. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia knew that the Au&s;trians were his &s;ecret enemies, and that the Ru&s;&s;ians were in league with them
<PB N="363" REF="365">
again&s;t him. An alliance, therefore, with the court of London kept back the Ru&s;&s;ians, whom he dreaded, and gave him hopes of pu|ni&s;hing Au&s;tria, whom he long &s;u&s;pected. As for France he counted upon that as a natural ally, which, from its long and hereditary en|mity with the Au&s;trians, would ever continue &s;tedfa&s;t in his intere&s;ts. On the other &s;ide, the elector of Hanover had &s;till &s;tronger ex|pectations from the benefits that would re&s;ult from this alliance. By this he procured a near and powerful ally, which he &s;uppo&s;ed the French would not venture to di&s;oblige. He counted upon the Au&s;trians as naturally at|tached to his own intere&s;ts by gratitude and friend&s;hip, and he &s;uppo&s;ed that the Ru&s;&s;ians would at lea&s;t continue neuter from their former &s;tipulations and &s;ub&s;idy. The two contracting powers &s;oon found them&s;elves de|ceived in every one of the&s;e expectations.</P>
<P>This alliance &s;oon after gave birth to one of an oppo&s;ite nature, that a&s;toni&s;hed all Eu|rope. The queen of Hungary had long me|ditated de&s;igns for recovering Sile&s;ia, which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had invaded when &s;he was unable to defend her native dominions, and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by a reluctant conce&s;|&s;ion. Her chief hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance were from
<PB N="364" REF="366">
Ru&s;&s;ia; and &s;he expected the re&s;t of the pow|ers in que&s;tion would continue neuter. How|ever &s;he now found by the late treaty that all her hopes of Ru&s;&s;ian a&s;&s;i&s;tance were fru&s;trated, as England was joined with Pru&s;&s;ia to counter|act her intentions. Thus deprived of one ally, &s;he &s;ought about, in order to &s;ub&s;titute another. She applied to France for that pur|po&s;e; and to procure the friend&s;hip of that court, gave up her barrier in the Netherlands, which England had been for ages &s;ecuring again&s;t that power with its blood and its trea|&s;ures. By this extraordinary revolution the whole political &s;y&s;tem of Europe acquired a new a&s;pect, and the treaties of a century were at one blow rendered ineffectual.</P>
<P>This treaty between France and Au&s;tria was no &s;ooner ratified, than the czarina was in|vited to accede; and &s;he, unmindful of her &s;ub&s;idies from England, ardently embraced the propo&s;al. A &s;ettlement in the we&s;tern parts of Europe was what that &s;tate had long de&s;ired to obtain, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, this fierce northern empire could then pour down fre&s;h forces at any time upon the &s;outhern powers, exhau&s;ted by luxury, and mutual contention. But not Ru&s;&s;ia alone, but Swe|den al&s;o, was brought to accede by the in|trigues
<PB N="365" REF="367">
of France; and a war between that nation and Pru&s;&s;ia was entered upon, though contrary to the inclinations of the re&s;pective kings of either &s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus the forces of the contending powers were now drawn out in the following manner. England oppo&s;ed France in America, A&s;ia, and on the ocean. France attacked Hanover on the continent of Europe. This country the king of Pru&s;&s;ia undertook to protect; while England promi&s;ed him troops and money to a&s;&s;i&s;t his operations. Then again Au&s;tria had their aims on the dominions of Pru&s;&s;ia, and drew the elector of Saxony into the &s;ame de|&s;igns. In the&s;e views &s;he was &s;econded by France and Sweden, and by Ru&s;&s;ia, who had hopes of acquiring a &s;ettlement in the we&s;t of Europe. Such were the different combina|tions, which were formed to begin the general war, while the re&s;t of the powers continued anxious &s;pectators of the contention.</P>
<P>The preparations for war were fir&s;t begun on the &s;ide of Au&s;tria, who had engaged the elector of Saxony in the general di&s;pute. Great armaments were, therefore, put on foot in Moravia and Bohemia, while the elector of Saxony, under a pretence of military parade, drew together about &s;ixteen thou&s;and men,
<PB N="366" REF="368">
which were po&s;ted in a &s;trong &s;ituation at Pir|na. But the intent of the&s;e preparations was &s;oon perceived by the vigilant king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and he ordered his mini&s;ter at the court of Vienna to demand a clear explanation, and to extort proper a&s;&s;urances of the amicable inten|tions of that court. To this demand he at fir&s;t received an eva&s;ive an&s;wer; but having ordered his mini&s;ter to in&s;i&s;t upon an open re|ply, whether the Empre&s;s-queen was for peace or war, and whether &s;he had any intentions to attack him that or the next year, an ambi|guous an&s;wer was &s;till returned. He now, therefore, thought proper to &s;u&s;pend all nego|ciations, and to carry the war into the enemies country, rather than to wait for it in his own.</P>
<P>He accordingly entered Saxony with a large army, and, in the u&s;ual &s;train of civility, de|manded from the elector a pa&s;&s;age through his dominions, which he well knew the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was not able to refu&s;e. In the mean time, he di&s;gui&s;ed his &s;u&s;picions of the elector's hav|ing entered into a &s;ecret treaty with his ene|mies, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely plea&s;ed with that potentate's promi&s;es of ob&s;erving a &s;trict neutrality. But to carry on the deceit &s;till farther, he entreated, that as the elector's troops were totally unnece&s;&s;ary, in con&s;equence
<PB N="367" REF="369">
of his pacific di&s;po&s;ition, that he would di&s;band them for the pre&s;ent, as he could not po&s;&s;ibly have any occa&s;ion for their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>This was a propo&s;al the elector neither ex|pected, nor was willing to comply with. He rejected the reque&s;t with di&s;dain; and the king, who probably made it to be refu&s;ed, re&s;olved to turn the occurrence to his own advantage. Such was the &s;ituation of the Saxon camp, that though a &s;mall army could defend it again&s;t the mo&s;t numerous forces, yet the &s;ame diffi|culty attended the quitting it, that impeded the enemy from &s;torming it. Of this, therefore, his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty took the advantage; and by blocking up every avenue of egre&s;s, he cut off the provi&s;ions of the Saxon army, and the whole body was &s;oon reduced to capitulate. He took care to incorporate the common &s;ol|diers into his own army; and the officers who refu&s;ed to &s;erve under him, he made pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia thus launched into a tumult of war, with all the mo&s;t potent &s;tates of Europe again&s;t him, and England only in alliance, went forward with a vigour that ex|ceeded what hi&s;tory can &s;hew, and that may be incredible to po&s;terity.

<P>What the king &s;aid of the in&s;tability of for|tune &s;hortly began to appear; and &s;he &s;eemed totally to have turned her back upon him. One di&s;a&s;ter followed upon the back of an|other. The Hanoverians, who were joined with him by his treaty with England, had armed in his favour, and commanded by the duke of Cumberland, who appeared, from the begin|ning, &s;en&s;ible of the in&s;ufficiency of his troops to face the enemy, by whom he was greatly out numbered. He was driven beyond the
<PB N="369" REF="371">
We&s;er, the pa&s;&s;age of which might have been di&s;puted with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, yet the French were permitted to pa&s;s it unmole&s;ted. The Hanoverian army, therefore, was now driven from one part of the country to another, till at length it made a &s;tand near a village called the Ha&s;tenback, where it was hoped the num|bers of the enemy would have the lea&s;t oppor|tunity of coming to a general action. How|ever, the weaker army was &s;till obliged to re|tire; and after a feeble effort left the field of battle to the French, who were not remi&s;s in urging the pur&s;uit. The Hanoverian army retired towards Stalde, by which means they marched into a country, from whence they could neither procure provi&s;ions, nor yet attack the enemy with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Unable, therefore, by their &s;ituation to e&s;cape, or by their &s;trength to advance, they were compelled to &s;ign a capitulation, by which the whole body laid down their arms, and were di&s;per&s;ed into different quarters of cantonment. By this remarkable capitulation, which was called the treaty of Clo&s;ter Seven, Hanover was obli|ged to &s;ubmit peaceably to the French, who now were determined to turn upon the king of Pru&s;&s;ia with undimini&s;hed forces.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="372">The &s;ituation of this monarch was become de&s;perate, nor could human fore&s;ight di&s;cover how he could extricate him&s;elf from his difficul|ties. The French forces now united invaded his dominions on one &s;ide, commanded by mar&s;hal Broglio. The Ru&s;&s;ians, who for &s;ome time had hovered over his empire, under the conduct of general Apraxin, all at once ha&s;ten|ed onward to overwhelm him, marking their way with &s;laughter and cruelty. A large body of Au&s;trians entered Sile&s;ia; and penetrating as far as Bre&s;lau, turned to the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Schweidnitz, which, after an ob&s;tinate de|fence, they obliged to &s;urrender. Another army of the &s;ame power entered Lu&s;atia, made them&s;elves ma&s;ter of Zittau, and, pre&s;&s;ing for|ward, laid the capital of Berlin under contribu|tion. On another quarter, a body of twenty two thou&s;and Swedes pierced into Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, took the towns of Anclam and Demmein, and exacted tribute from the whole country. In this multitude of invaders, it was in vain that the king of Pru&s;&s;ia faced about to every incur&s;ion, though his enemies fled before him; while he pur&s;ued one body, another pene|trated from behind, and even while he was victorious, his territories were every day dimi|ni&s;hing. The greate&s;t part of his dominions
<PB N="371" REF="373">
was laid under contribution, mo&s;t of his &s;trong|e&s;t cities were taken, and he had no re&s;ources but in the genero&s;ity of a Briti&s;h parliament, and his own exten&s;ive abilities.</P>
<P>The &s;uccours of the Engli&s;h could be of very little advantage to him, particularly as the Hanoverians were re&s;trained by treaty from acting in his favour. The mini&s;try, however, con&s;cious that &s;omething &s;hould be done, plan|ned an enterprize again&s;t the coa&s;ts of France, which, by cau&s;ing a diver&s;ion in that part of the kingdom, would draw off the attention of the enemy from Pru&s;&s;ia, and give that monarch time to re&s;pire. Be&s;ide this intention, England al&s;o hoped to give a blow to their marine, by de&s;troying &s;uch &s;hips as were building, or were laid up in the harbour of Rochford, again&s;t which city their operations were principally intended. The Engli&s;h mini&s;try kept the ob|ject of the enterprize a profound &s;ecret; and France was for &s;ome time filled with apprehen|&s;ions, till at length the &s;leet appeared before Rochford, where the commanders &s;pent &s;ome time in deliberating how to proceed. After &s;ome con&s;ultation, it was determined to &s;ecure the little i&s;land of Aix, an ea&s;y conque&s;t, and of no benefit to the invaders. In the mean time, the militia of the country, recovering
<PB N="372" REF="374">
from their con&s;ternation, had lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;em|ble, and there was the appearance of two camps upon &s;hore. The commanders, therefore, who from the badne&s;s of the weather, were prevent|ed from landing, now began to fear greater dangers from the enemy on land. They took into con&s;ideration the badne&s;s of the coa&s;t, the danger of landing, the time the city had been preparing for a vigorous defence, and their own unfitne&s;s to reduce it by any other means but a &s;udden attack. This con&s;ideration in|duced them to de&s;i&s;t from further operations; and they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to return home, without making any effort.</P>
<P>From this expedition, therefore, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia reaped but very little advantage; and the de&s;pondence among the Engli&s;h was &s;o great, that the mini&s;try had thoughts of giving up his cau&s;e entirely. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that no military efforts could &s;ave him; and that the only hope remaining was to make the be&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible for him with his victorious enemies. The king of England was actually meditating a negociation of this nature, when his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ally expo&s;tulated with him to the following purpo&s;e.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Is it po&s;&s;ible that your maje&s;ty can have &s;o little fortitude and con|&s;tancy as to be di&s;pirited by a &s;mall rever&s;e

of fortune. Are our affairs &s;o ruinous that they cannot be repaired? Con&s;ider the &s;tep you have made me undertake, and remem|ber you are the cau&s;e of all my misfortunes.

I do not now repent of the treaty concluded between us; but I entreat that you will not ingloriou&s;ly leave me at the mercy of my enemies, after having brought upon me all the powers of Europe."</Q>
In this terrible &s;ituation, England re&s;olved, more from motives of genero&s;ity, than of intere&s;t, to &s;upport his declining cau&s;e; and &s;ucce&s;s that had for a long time fled her arms, once more began to return with double &s;plendour.

<HEAD>CHAP. L. GEORGE II. (Continued.)</HEAD>
<P>THE Ea&s;t was the quarter on which &s;uc|ce&s;s fir&s;t began to dawn upon the Briti&s;h arms. The war in our A&s;iatic territories had never been wholly &s;u&s;pended. It was carried on at fir&s;t by both nations, under the colour of lend|ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the contending chiefs of the country, but the allies &s;oon became the princi|pals in the contention. This war at fir&s;t, and for a long time after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was carried on with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s; but at length the affairs of the Engli&s;h &s;eemed to gain the a&s;cendancy, by the conduct of Mr. Clive. This gentleman had at fir&s;t en|tered the company's &s;ervice in a civil capacity, but finding his talents more adapted for war, he gave up his clerk&s;hip, and joined among the troops as a volunteer. His courage, which is all that &s;ubordinate officers can at fir&s;t &s;hew, &s;oon became remarkable, but his conduct, expedition, and military &s;kill &s;oon after became &s;o con&s;picuous as to rai&s;e him to the fir&s;t rank in the army.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="377">The fir&s;t advantage that was obtained from his activity and courage was the clearing the province of Arcot. Soon after the French general was taken pri&s;oner; and the nabob, whom the Engli&s;h &s;upported, was rein&s;tated in the government, of which he had formerly been deprived.</P>
<P>The French, di&s;couraged by the&s;e misfor|tunes, and &s;en&s;ible of their own inferiority in this part of the globe, &s;ent over a commi&s;&s;ary to Europe to re&s;tore peace. A convention between the two companies was accordingly concluded, importing, that the territories taken on either &s;ide &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t peace &s;hould be mutually re&s;tored; that the nabobs advanced by the influence of either party &s;hould be acknowledged by both; and that for the future neither &s;hould interfere in the differences that &s;hould ari&s;e between the princes of the country.</P>
<P>This ce&s;&s;ation, which promi&s;ed &s;uch la&s;ting tranquillity, was, neverthele&s;s, but of &s;hort duration. Compacts made between trading companies can never be of long continuance, when advantage is oppo&s;ed to good faith. In a few months both &s;ides renewed their opera|tions, no longer under the name of auxiliaries, but as rivals in arms, in government, and in
<PB N="376" REF="378">
commerce. What the motives to this infrac|tion were, are not &s;ufficiently known; but wherever there is trade, there is avarice; and that is a pa&s;&s;ion that breaks the bounds of equity. Certain it is, that the prince of the greate&s;t power in that country declared war again&s;t the Engli&s;h from motives of per&s;onal re&s;entment, and, levying a numerous army, laid &s;iege to Calcutta, one of the principal Briti&s;h forts in that part of the world; but which was not in a &s;tate of &s;trength to defend it&s;elf again&s;t the attack of even barbarians. The fort was taken, having been de&s;erted by the commander; and the garri&s;on, to the number of an hundred and forty-&s;ix per&s;ons, were made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>They expected the u&s;ual treatment of pri|&s;oners of war, and were therefore the le&s;s vi|gorous in their defence; but they &s;oon found what mercy was to be expected from a &s;avage conqueror. They were all crowded together into a narrow pri&s;on, called the Black Hole, of about eighteen feet &s;quare, and receiving air only by two &s;mall iron windows to the we&s;t, which by no means afforded a &s;ufficient circulation. It is terrible to reflect on the &s;i|tuation of the&s;e unfortunate men, &s;hut up in this narrow place, in the burning climate of the ea&s;t, and &s;uffocating each other. Their
<PB N="377" REF="379">
fir&s;t efforts, upon perceiving the effects of their horrid confinement, were to break open the door of the pri&s;on; but as it opened in|ward, they &s;oon found that impo&s;&s;ible. They next endeavoured to excite the compa&s;&s;ion, or the avidity of the guard, by offering him a large &s;um of money for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in re|moving them to &s;eparate pri&s;ons; but with this he was not able to comply, as the viceroy was a&s;leep, and no per&s;on dared to di&s;turb him. They were now, therefore, left to die without hopes of relief; and the whole pri|&s;on was filled with groans, &s;hrieks, conte&s;t, and de&s;pair. This turbulence, however, &s;oon after &s;unk into a calm, &s;till more hideous; their efforts of &s;trength and courage were over, and an expiring languor &s;ucceeded. In the morn|ing, when the keepers came to vi&s;it the pri|&s;on, all was horror, &s;ilence, and de&s;olation. Of an hundred and forty-&s;ix who had entered alive, twenty-three only &s;urvived, and of the&s;e the greate&s;t part died of putrid fevers upon being &s;et free.</P>
<P>The de&s;truction of this important fortre&s;s &s;erved to interrupt the pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h company. But the fortune of Mr. Clive, backed by the activity of an Eng|li&s;h fleet under admiral Wat&s;on, &s;till turned
<PB N="378" REF="380">
the &s;cale in their favour. Among the num|ber of tho&s;e who felt the power of the Eng|li&s;h in this part of the world was the famous Tullagee Angria, a piratical prince, who had long infected the Indian ocean, and made the princes on the coa&s;t his tributaries. He main|tained a large number of gallies, and with the&s;e he attacked the large&s;t &s;hips, and almo&s;t ever with &s;ucce&s;s. As the company had been greatly harra&s;&s;ed by his depredations, they re|&s;olved to &s;ubdue &s;uch a dangerous enemy, and attack him in his own fortre&s;s. In pur|&s;uance of this re&s;olution, admiral Wat&s;on and colonel Clive &s;ailed into his harbour of Ge|riah; and though they &s;u&s;tained a warm fire as they entered, yet they &s;oon threw all his &s;leet into flames, and obliged his fort to &s;ur|render at di&s;cretion. The conquerors found there a large quantity of warlike &s;tores, and effects to a con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>From this-conque&s;t colonel Clive proceeded to take revenge for the cruelty practi&s;ed upon the Engli&s;h at Calcutta; and about the be|ginning of December arrived at Bala&s;ore, in the kingdom of Bengal. He met with little oppo&s;ition either to the fleet or the army, till they came before Calcutta, which &s;eemed re|&s;olved to &s;tand a regular &s;iege. As &s;oon as
<PB N="379" REF="381">
the admiral, with two &s;hips, arrived before the town, he received a furious fire from all the batteries, which he &s;oon returned with &s;till greater execution, and in le&s;s than two hours obliged them to abandon their fortifications. By the&s;e means the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two &s;tronge&s;t &s;ettlements on the banks of the Ganges; but that of Geriah they demo|li&s;hed to the ground.</P>
<P>Soon after the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, Hughly, a city of great trade, was reduced with as little diffi|culty as the former; and all the viceroy of Bengal's &s;tore-hou&s;es and granaries were de|&s;troyed. In order to repair the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, this barbarous prince a&s;&s;embled an army of ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, and fifteen thou&s;and foot, and profe&s;&s;ed a firm re&s;olution of expelling the Engli&s;h from all their &s;ettlements in that part of the world. Upon the fir&s;t intelligence of his march, colonel Clive obtaining a reinforce|ment of men from the admiral's &s;hips, ad|vanced with his little army to attack the&s;e nu|merous forces. He attacked the enemy in three columns; and though the numbers were &s;o di&s;proportioned, victory &s;oon declared in fa|vour of the Engli&s;h. This, as well as &s;everal other victories gained by this commander a|gain&s;t &s;uch a numerous enemy, teach us no
<PB N="380" REF="382">
longer to wonder at tho&s;e conque&s;ts which were gained formerly by European troops over this weak and effeminate people. Indeed, what can &s;lavi&s;h A&s;iatic troops do again&s;t an army, however &s;mall, hardened by di&s;cipline, and animated by honour. All the cu&s;toms, habits, and opinions of the A&s;iatics, tend to effeminate the body, and di&s;pirit the mind. When we conceive a body of men led up to the attack dre&s;&s;ed in long &s;ilken garments, with no other courage than what opium can in&s;pire, no other fears from a defeat, but that of changing their tyrant, with their chief com|mander mounted on an elephant, and con&s;e|quently a more con&s;picuous object of aim, their artillery drawn by oxen, impatient and furious on the &s;lighte&s;t wound, every &s;ol|dier among them unacquainted with cool intrepidity, which provides again&s;t danger, and only fighting by the &s;ame fury that rai&s;es their pa&s;&s;ions; if we con&s;ider all the&s;e circum|&s;tances, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed at European victories, and that two or three thou&s;and men are able to defeat the large&s;t armies they can bring into the field. All the heroi&s;m of a Cyrus, or an Alexander, in this view will &s;ink in our e&s;teem, and no longer continue the object of admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="383">A victory &s;o ea&s;ily acquired by a &s;mall body of foreigners &s;oon rendered the viceroy of Bengal contemptible to his &s;ubjects at home. His cowardice now rendered him de&s;picable, and his former cruelty odious. A con&s;piracy, therefore, was projected again&s;t him by Ali Kan, his prime mini&s;ter; and the Engli&s;h hav|ing private intimations of the de&s;ign, they re|&s;olved to &s;econd it with all their endeavours. Accordingly, colonel Clive, knowing that he had a friend in the enemy's camp, marched forward, and &s;oon came up with the viceroy, who had by this time recruited his army, and fitted it once more for action. After a &s;hort conte&s;t, however, Clive was as u&s;ual vic|torious; the whole Indian army was put to flight, and routed with terrible &s;laughter. Ali Kan, who fir&s;t incited his ma&s;ter to this undertaking, had hitherto concealed his at|tachments to the Engli&s;h, till he &s;aw there was no danger from his perfidy. But upon the a&s;&s;urance of the victory, he openly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ide of the, conquerors, and in con&s;equence of his private &s;ervices was &s;olemnly proclaim|ed by colonel Clive viceroy of Bengal, Rahar, and Orixa, in the room of the former nabob, who was &s;olemnly depo&s;ed, and &s;oon after put to death by his perfidious &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h having placed a viceroy on the
<PB N="382" REF="384">
throne (for the Mogul had long lo&s;t all power in India) they took care to exact &s;uch &s;tipula|tions in their own favour, as would &s;ecure them the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country whenever they thought proper to re&s;ume their authority. They were gratified in their avarice to its ex|treme&s;t wi&s;h; and that wealth which they had plundered from &s;laves in India, they were re|&s;olved to employ in making &s;laves at home.</P>
<P>From the conque&s;t of the Indians, colonel Clive turned to the humbling of the French, who had long di&s;puted empire in that part of the world. Chadenagore, a French &s;ettlement higher up the Ganges than Calcutta, was com|pelled to &s;ubmit to the Engli&s;h arms. The goods and money found in this place were con&s;iderable; but the chief damage the French &s;u&s;tained, was from the ruin of this their chief &s;ettlement on the Ganges, by which they had long divided the commerce of this part of the continent. Thus in one campaign, which was carried on by the activity of Clive, and &s;econd|ed by the operations of the admirals Wat&s;on and Pococke, the Engli&s;h became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a territory &s;uperior in wealth, fertility, extent, and the number of its inhabitants, to any part of Europe. Above two millions &s;terling were paid to the company and the &s;urvivors of the impri&s;onment at Calcutta; the &s;oldiers and
<PB N="383" REF="385">
&s;eamen &s;hared &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, and the Engli&s;h power became irre&s;i&s;tible in that part of the world.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;s was not a little alarming to the French mini&s;try; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that even the Dutch entertained &s;ome jealou&s;y of this growing greatne&s;s. To make &s;ome degree of oppo&s;ition, they &s;ent out a con&s;iderable rein|forcement under the command of general Lally, an Iri&s;hman, from who&s;e great expe|rience &s;anguine hopes were conceived. Lally was one of the brave&s;t &s;oldiers in the French &s;ervice, but the mo&s;t unfit man in the world to be connected with a trading company, as he was fierce, proud, and precipitate, not without a mixture of avarice, which tempted him to &s;hare in their gain. He had been from his youth bred up to arms, and carried the &s;pirit of di&s;cipline to a faulty extreme, in a place where the nature of the &s;ervice required its relaxation.</P>
<P>Under the guidance of this whim&s;ical man, the affairs of the French for &s;ome time &s;eem|ed to wear a face of &s;ucce&s;s. He took from the Engli&s;h their &s;ettlement of fort St. Da|vid's, and plundered the country of the king of Tanjour, in alliance with the enemy. He then entered the province of Arcot, and pre|pared for laying &s;iege to Madra&s;s, the chief &s;ettlement of the Engli&s;h on the coa&s;t of Co|romandel.
<PB N="384" REF="386">
In the &s;iege of this important place, a greater variety of difficulties pre&s;ented than he had expected or prepared for. The artil|lery of the garri&s;on was well managed, while on the other &s;ide the French &s;oldiers acted with the greate&s;t timidity; nor did even the council of Pondicherry &s;econd the ardour of the general. It was in vain that Lally at|tempted to lead on his men to a breach that had been practicable for &s;everal days, it con|tinued open for a fortnight, and not one dared to venture the a&s;&s;ault. To add to his embar|ra&s;&s;ments, he was very ill &s;upplied with provi|&s;ions, and he found the garri&s;on had received a reinforcement. De&s;pairing, therefore, of &s;uc|ce&s;s, he rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and this &s;o intimidated his troops, that they &s;eemed quite di&s;pirited in every &s;ucceeding operation.</P>
<P>But while &s;ucce&s;s was thus doubtful be|tween the two contending nations, a rupture &s;eemed to be in preparation upon a quarter where the Engli&s;h lea&s;t expected. The Dutch, under pretence of reinforcing their garri&s;ons in Bengal, equipped a &s;trong armament of &s;even &s;hips, which was ordered to &s;ail up the Ganges, and render their fort at Chincura &s;o formidable as to exclude all other nations from the &s;alt-petre trade, which was carried on there, and thus monopolize &s;o beneficial a commodity.
<PB N="385" REF="387">
This de&s;ign, however, colonel Clive thought proper to oppo&s;e. He accordingly &s;ent the Dutch commander a letter, informing him that he could not permit his landing, and marching his forces to the fort intended, as he fore&s;aw that it would be detrimental to the commerce of Europe. To this me&s;&s;age the Dutchman re|plied, that he had no &s;uch de&s;igns of a mono|poly as were imputed to him, and he only re|que&s;ted the liberty to land and refre&s;h his troops, which reque&s;t, &s;o &s;eemingly rea&s;onable, was quickly granted. However, the Dutch commander continued &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive no longer than he &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf unable to act with vigour, for as &s;oon as he knew that the &s;hips which were to &s;econd his operations were come up the river, he boldly began his march to Chincura, and took &s;everal &s;mall ve&s;&s;els be|longing to the Engli&s;h in his pa&s;&s;age up the river, to retaliate for the affront he pretended to have received.</P>
<P>Whether the Calcutta Indiaman was &s;ent out upon this occa&s;ion to oppo&s;e the Dutch, or whether it was only pur&s;uing its voyage down the river to England, is not known; but certain it is, that &s;he was prevented by the Dutch commander from going onward, and obliged to return to Calcutta with the com|plaints
<PB N="386" REF="388">
of this treatment to colonel Clive. The colonel was not flow in vindicating the honour of his country; and as there happened to be three India &s;hips at that time in the harbour, he gave them in&s;tant orders to meet the Dutch fleet, and &s;ink them if they offered to re&s;i&s;t. This command was obeyed with great alacrity; but after a few broad&s;ides on either &s;ide, the Dutch commander &s;truck, and the re&s;t of the fleet followed his example. The victory thus obtained, without any great damage, captain Wil&s;on, who commanded in the expedition, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fleet of the enemy, and &s;ent their men pri&s;oners to the Engli&s;h fort; while about the &s;ame time their land forces were defeated by colonel Ford, &s;ent by Clive upon that duty. This conte&s;t had like to have produced a new rupture in that part of the world; but a negociation &s;oon after en&s;uing, the Dutch wi&s;ely gave way to a power they were not able to with&s;tand, and were content to &s;it down with the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time the operations again&s;t the French were carried on with much more &s;plen|did &s;ucce&s;s. The troops headed by colonel Coote, a native of Ireland, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of prudence and bravery, marched again&s;t general
<PB N="387" REF="389">
Lally, re&s;olved to come to a deci&s;ive engage|ment. On his march he took the city of Wan|dewa&s;h, he afterwards reduced the fortre&s;s of Carangoly, and at length came up with the French general, who had no thoughts of de|clining the engagement. In the morning early the French advanced within three quarters of a mile of the Engli&s;h line, and the canno|nading began with great fury on both &s;ides. The engagement continued with great ob&s;ti|nacy till about two in the afternoon, when the French gave way, and fled towards their camp, which they as quickly abandoned, leaving their baggage, cannon, and the field of battle to the conquerors.</P>
<P>The retaking the city of Arcot, was the con|&s;equence of this victory; and nothing now re|mained to the French, of all their former do|minions in India, but the &s;trong town of Pon|dicherry, their large&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful &s;et|tlement. This city, which was the capital of the French e&s;tabli&s;hments in India, exceeded, in the days of its pro&s;perity, all other Euro|pean factories there, in trade, opulence, and &s;plendour; and whatever wealth the French &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, after repeated lo&s;&s;es, was de|po&s;ited there. As &s;oon as the fortre&s;&s;es adja|cent were reduced, colonel Coote &s;at down be|fore
<PB N="388" REF="390">
the city, determined to blockade it by land, while admiral Stevens &s;hut up the har|bour by &s;ea. A regular &s;iege was at that time impracticable, from the periodical rains which in that climate would not fail &s;oon to ob&s;truct all &s;uch operations. However, neither the rains nor the inclemency of the climate, were able to abate the ardour of the be&s;iegers; the blockade was continued, and the garri&s;on was pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that it was reduced to the mo&s;t extreme di&s;tre&s;s. The French &s;oldiers were obliged to feed on dogs and cats; however, Lally, the commander, was deter|termined to hold out to the la&s;t. In the mid&s;t of the garri&s;on's di&s;tre&s;s, fortune &s;eemed to give an opportunity of relief, had it been &s;eized with vigour. One of tho&s;e terrible tempe&s;ts, common in that climate, wrecked a large part of the Engli&s;h fleet that was blocking up the harbour. Lally wrote the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing letters to the French re&s;idents at the Dutch &s;ettle|ments, to be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, but to his mortification, in&s;tead of &s;eeing the French boats coming to his relief, he only &s;aw, in le&s;s than four days, the Engli&s;h admiral again en|tering the harbour, having repaired the damage he had lately &s;u&s;tained. Lally, however, &s;till determined to hold out, and with a &s;avage ob|&s;tinacy
<PB N="389" REF="391">
&s;aw his troops half con&s;uming with fa|tigue and famine round him. At length, find|ing that a breach had been made in the ram|part, and that no more than one day's provi|&s;ion remained, he permitted a &s;ignal to be made for cea&s;ing ho&s;tilities. Yet &s;till the &s;trong perver&s;ene&s;s of his temper continued; he &s;ent a paper filled with reproaches again&s;t the Engli&s;h, he alledged that he would not treat upon honourable terms with an enemy that had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed all the laws of honour. He, &s;urrendered the place not in his own per&s;on, but permitted &s;ome under officers in the garri&s;on to obtain terms of capitulation. This conque&s;t put an end to the power of France in India. The chief part of the territory and trade of that va&s;t penin&s;ula, from the Indus to the Ganges, was annexed to the Briti&s;h empire. The princes of the country, after &s;ome vain oppo&s;ition to the Engli&s;h power, were at length contented to &s;ubmit; and the whole country has &s;ince continued our own.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while conque&s;t &s;hined up|on us from the Ea&s;t, it was &s;till more &s;plendid in the we&s;tern world. But &s;ome alterations in the mini&s;try, led to tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es which had been long wi&s;hed for by the nation, and were at length obtained. The affairs of war had
<PB N="390" REF="392">
been hitherto directed by a mini&s;try, but ill &s;upported by the commons, becau&s;e not confided in by the people. They &s;eemed ti|mid and wavering; and but feebly held toge|ther, rather by their fears than their mutual confidence. When any new mea&s;ure was pro|po&s;ed, which could not receive their approba|tion, or any new member was introduced into government whom they did not appoint, they con&s;idered it as an infringement upon their re|&s;pective departments, and threw up their places in di&s;gu&s;t, with a view to re&s;ume them with greater lu&s;tre. Thus the &s;trength of the crown was every day declining, while an ari&s;tocracy filled up every avenue to the throne, intent only on the emoluments, not the duties of office.</P>
<P>This was at that time the general opinion of the people, and it was too loud not to reach the throne. The mini&s;try that had hitherto hedged in the throne, were at length obliged to admit &s;ome men into a &s;hare of the govern|ment, who&s;e activity at lea&s;t would counter-balance their timidity and irre&s;olution. At the head of the newly introduced party, was the celebrated Mr. William Pitt, from who&s;e vigour the nation formed very great expecta|tions, and they were not deceived.</P>
<P><PB N="391" REF="393">But though the old mini&s;ters were obliged to admit the&s;e new members into their &s;ociety, there was no legal penalty for refu&s;ing to operate with them; they therefore a&s;&s;ociated with each other, and u&s;ed every art to make their new a&s;&s;i&s;tants obnoxious to the king, upon whom they had been in a manner forced by the peo|ple. His former mini&s;try flattered him in all his attachments to his German dominions, while the new had long clamoured again&s;t all continental connexions, as utterly imcompati|ble with the intere&s;t of the nation. The&s;e two opinions carried to the extreme, might have been erroneous; but the king was naturally led to &s;ide with tho&s;e who favoured his own &s;entiments, and to reject tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them. Mr. Pitt, therefore, after being a few months in office, was ordered to re&s;ign by his maje&s;ty's command, and his coadjutor, Mr. Legge, was di&s;placed from being chancellor of the exchequer. But this blow to his ambi|tion was but of &s;hort continuance; the whole nation, almo&s;t to a man, &s;eemed to ri&s;e up in his defence, and Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge, were once more reluctantly re&s;tored to their former employments, the one of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the other of chancellor of the exchequer.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="394">The con&s;equences of the former ill conduct|ed coun&s;els &s;till &s;eemed to continue in Ameri|ca. The generals &s;ent over to manage the operations of the war, loudly accu&s;ed the ti|midity and delays of the natives, who&s;e duty it was to unite in their own defence. The na|tives, on the other hand, as warmly expo&s;tu|lated again&s;t the pride, avarice, and incapa|city of tho&s;e &s;ent over to command them. General Shirley, who had been appointed to the &s;upreme command there, had been for &s;ome time recalled, and replaced by lord Lou|don; and this nobleman al&s;o &s;oon after return|ing to England, three &s;everal commanders were put at the head of &s;eparate operations. General Amher&s;t commanded that de&s;igned again&s;t the i&s;land of Cape Breton. The other was con&s;igned to general Abercrombie, again&s;t Crown Point and Ticonderago; and the third &s;till more to the &s;outhward, again&s;t fort du Que&s;ne, commanded by brigadier-general Forbes.</P>
<P>Cape Breton, which had been taken from the French during the preceding war, had been re&s;tored at the treaty of Aix la Chapelle. It was not till the Engli&s;h had been put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land, that they began to per|ceive its advantageous &s;ituation; and the con|venience of its harbour for annoying the Bri|ti&s;h
<PB N="393" REF="395">
trade with impunity. It was al&s;o a con|venient port for carrying on their fi&s;hery, a branch of commerce of the utmo&s;t benefit to that nation. The wre&s;ting it, therefore, once more from the hands of the French, was a mea&s;ure ardently de&s;ired by the whole nation. The fortre&s;s of Loui&s;burg, by which it was de|fended, had been &s;trengthened by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of art, and was &s;till better defended from the nature of its &s;ituation. The garri&s;on al&s;o was numerous, the commander vigilant, and every precaution taken to oppo&s;e a landing. An account of the operations of the &s;iege can give but little plea&s;ure in abridgement, be it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the Engli&s;h &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle with great intrepidity. Their former timidity and irre&s;olution &s;eemed to vani&s;h, their natural courage and confidence returned, and the place &s;urrendered by capitu|lation. The fortifications were &s;oon after de|moli&s;hed, and rendered unfit for future pro|tection.</P>
<P>The expedition to Fort du Que&s;ne was equally &s;ucce&s;sful; but that again&s;t Crown Point was once more defeated. This was now the &s;econd time that the Engli&s;h army had at|tempted to penetrate into tho&s;e hideous wilds; by which nature had &s;ecured the French po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
<PB N="394" REF="396">
in that part of the world. Braddock fell in the attempt a martyr to his impetuo&s;ity; too much caution was equally injurious to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Abercrombie &s;pent much time in marching to the place of action; and the ene|my were thus perfectly prepared to give him a &s;evere reception. As he approached Ticon|derago, he &s;ound them deeply intrenched at the foot of the fort, and &s;till farther &s;ecured by fallen trees, with their branches pointing again&s;t him. The&s;e difficulties the Engli&s;h ardour attempted to &s;urmount; but as the enemy being &s;ecure them&s;elves, took aim at lei&s;ure, a terrible carnage of the a&s;&s;ailants en|&s;ued; and the general, after repeated efforts, was obliged to order a retreat. The Engli&s;h army, however, was &s;till &s;uperior; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed that when the artillery was arrived, &s;omething more &s;ucce&s;sful might be performed; but the general felt too &s;en&s;ibly the terrors of the late defeat to remain in the neighbourhood of a triumphant enemy. He therefore with|drew his troops, and returned to his camp at Lake George, from whence he had taken his departure.</P>
<P>But though in this re&s;pect the Engli&s;h arms were un&s;ucce&s;sful, yet upon the whole the campaign was greatly in their favour. The
<PB N="395" REF="397">
taking of Fort du Que&s;ne &s;erved to remove from their colonies the terror of the incur&s;ions of the Indians, while it interrupted that cor|re&s;pondence which ran along a chain of forts, with which the French had environed the Eng|li&s;h &s;ettlements in America. This, therefore, promi&s;ed a fortunate campaign the next year, and vigorous mea&s;ures were taken to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Accordingly, on the opening of the follow|ing year, the mini&s;try, &s;en&s;ible that a &s;ingle effort carried on in &s;uch an exten&s;ive country, could never reduce the enemy, they re&s;olved to attack them in &s;everal parts of their empire at once. Preparations were accordingly made, and expeditions driven forward again&s;t three different parts of North America at the &s;ame time. General Amher&s;t, the commander in chief, with a body of twelve thou&s;and men, was to attack Crown Point, that had hitherto been the reproach of the Engli&s;h army. General Wolfe was at the oppo&s;ite quarter to enter the river St. Lawrence, and undertake the &s;iege of Quebec, the capital of the French domi|nions in America; while general Prideaux, and Sir William John&s;on, were to attempt a French fort, near the cataracts of Niagara.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="398">The la&s;t named expedition was the fir&s;t that &s;ucceeded. The fort of Niagara was a place of great importance, and &s;erved to command all the communication between the northern and we&s;tern French &s;ettlements. The &s;iege was begun with vigour, and promi&s;ed an ea&s;y conque&s;t; but general Prideaux was killed in the trenches, by the bur&s;ting of a mortar; &s;o that the whole command of the expedition devolved upon general John&s;on, who omitted nothing to pu&s;h forward the vigorous opera|tions of his predece&s;&s;or, to which al&s;o he added his own popularity with the &s;oldiers under him. A body of French troops, who were &s;en&s;ible of the importance of this fort, attempted to re|lieve it; but John&s;on attacked them with in|trepidity and &s;ucce&s;s; for in le&s;s than an hour their whole army was put to the rout. The garri&s;on &s;oon after perceiving the fate of their countrymen, &s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war. The &s;ucce&s;s of general Amher&s;t was le&s;s &s;plen|did though not le&s;s &s;erviceable; upon arriving at the de&s;tined place, he found the forts both of Crown Point and Ticonderago de&s;erted and de&s;toyed.</P>
<P>There now, therefore, remained but one grand and deci&s;ive blow to put all North America into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h;
<PB N="397" REF="399">
and this was the taking of Quebec, the capital of Canada, a city hand&s;omely built, populous, and flouri&s;hing. Admiral Saunders was appoin|ted to command the naval part of the expedi|tion; the &s;iege by land was committed to the conduct of general Wolfe, of whom the nation had great expectations. This young &s;oldier, who was not yet thirty-five, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on many former occa&s;ions, particularly at the &s;iege of Loui&s;burg; <MILESTONE N="1759" UNIT="A.D."> a part of the &s;ucce&s;s of which was ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to him, who, with|out being indebted to family or connexions, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf by merit to his pre&s;ent command.</P>
<P>The war in this part of the world had been hitherto carried on with extreme barbarity; and retaliating murders were continued without any one's knowing who fir&s;t began. Wolfe, however, di&s;dained to imitate an example that had been &s;et him even by &s;ome of his a&s;|&s;ociate officers; he carried on the war with all the &s;pirit of humanity which it admits of. It is not our aim to enter into a mi|nute detail of the &s;iege of this city, which could at be&s;t only give amu&s;ement to a few; it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that when we con|&s;ider the &s;ituation of the town on the &s;ide of a great river, the fortifications with which it was
<PB N="398" REF="400">
&s;ecured, the natural &s;trength of the country, the great number of ve&s;&s;els and floating batteries the enemy had provided for the defence of the river, the numerous bodies of &s;avages con|tinually hovering round the Engli&s;h army, we mu&s;t own there was &s;uch a combination of difficulties, as might di&s;courage and perplex the mo&s;t re&s;olute commander. The general him&s;elf &s;eemed perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the diffi|culty of the undertaking. After &s;tating, in a letter to the mini&s;try, the dangers that pre&s;ent|ed.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know, &s;aid he, that the affairs of of Great Britain require the mo&s;t vigorous mea&s;ures. But then the courage of an handful of brave men &s;hould be exerted on|ly where there is &s;ome hope of a favourable event. At pre&s;ent the difficulties are &s;o va|rious, that I am at a lo&s;s now to determine."</Q>
The only pro&s;pect of attempting the town with &s;ucce&s;s was by landing a body of troops in the night below the town, who were to clamber up the banks of the river, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground on the back of the city. This attempt, however, appeared pe|culiarly di&s;couraging. The &s;tream was rapid, the &s;hore &s;helving, the bank above lined with centinels, the landing-place &s;o narrow as to be ea&s;ily mi&s;&s;ed in the dark, and the &s;teepine&s;s of
<PB N="399" REF="401">
the ground &s;uch as hardly to be &s;urmounted in the day time. All the&s;e difficulties, how|ever, were &s;urmounted by the conduct of the general, and the bravery of the men. Colonel Howe, with the light infantry and the High|landers, a&s;cended the woody precipices with admirable courage, and activity, and di&s;lodged a &s;mall body of troops that defended a narrow path way up the bank; thus a few mounting, the general drew the re&s;t up in order as they arrived. Mon&s;ieur de Montcalm, the French commander, was no &s;ooner apprized that the Engli&s;h had gained the&s;e heights, which he had confidently deemed inacce&s;&s;ible, than he re&s;olved to hazard a battle; and a furious en|counter quickly began. This was one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate engagements during this war. The French general was &s;lain; the &s;e|cond in command &s;hared the &s;ame fate. Ge|neral Wolfe was &s;tationed on the right, where the attack was mo&s;t warm; as he &s;tood con&s;pi|cuous in the front line, he had been aimed at by the enemies mark&s;men, and received a &s;hot in the wri&s;t, which, however, did not oblige him to quit the field. Having wrapped an handkerchief round his hand, he continued giving orders without the lea&s;t emotion, and advanced at the head of the grenadiers with
<PB N="400" REF="402">
their bayonets fixed; but a &s;econd ball more fatal, pierced his brea&s;t; &s;o that unable to proceed, he leaned on the &s;houlder of a &s;oldier that was next him. Now &s;truggling in the agonies of death, and ju&s;t expiring, he heard a voice cry, They run! upon which he &s;eemed for a moment to revive, and a&s;king who ran, was informed the French. Expre&s;&s;ing his wonder that they ran &s;o &s;oon, and unable to gaze any longer, he &s;unk on the &s;oldier's brea&s;t, and his la&s;t words were, <Q REND="inline">"I die happy."</Q> Perhaps the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h that day was greater than the conque&s;t of Canada was advantage|ous. But it is the lot of mankind only to know true merit on that dreadful occa&s;ion, when they are going to lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>The &s;urrender of Quebec was the con&s;e|quence of this victory; and with it &s;oon after the total ce&s;&s;ion of all Canada. The French, indeed, the following &s;ea&s;on made a vigorous effort to retake the city; but by the re&s;olution of governor Murray, and the appearance of an Engli&s;h fleet under the command of lord Col|vile, they were obliged to abandon the enter|prize. The whole province was &s;oon after reduced by the prudence and activity of gene|ral Amher&s;t, who obliged the French army to capitulate, and it has &s;ince remained annexed to
<PB N="401" REF="403">
the Briti&s;h empire. To the&s;e conque&s;ts about the &s;ame time was added the reduction of the i&s;land of Guadalupe, under commodore More, and general Hop&s;on, an acqui&s;ition of great importance; but which was re&s;tored at the &s;uc|ceeding peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es in India and America were great, tho' atchieved by no very expen&s;ive efforts; on the contrary, the efforts the Engli&s;h made in Europe, and the operations of their great ally, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, were a&s;toni&s;hing, yet pro|duced no &s;ignal advantages. A defen&s;ive war in Germany was all that could be expected; and that he maintained again&s;t the united powers of the continent with unexampled bravery. We left the French and Imperiali&s;ts triumphing in repeated &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and enjoying the fruits of an advantageous &s;ummer-cam|paign. But as if &s;ummer was not &s;ufficient for the horrors of war, they now re&s;olved to exert them even amid&s;t the rigours of winter, and in the depth of that &s;ea&s;on &s;et down and formed the &s;iege of Leip&s;ic. The capture of that city would have been fatal to the intere&s;ts of the king; and by one of tho&s;e rapid marches, for which he was remarkable, he &s;eemed with his army, un|expectedly, to ri&s;e up before the town. Such was the terror of his arms, that even vanqui&s;hed as
<PB N="402" REF="404">
he &s;eemed, the French, though &s;uperior in numbers, rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retreated. He was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue, and at length overtook them at a village called Ro&s;bach, where he gained &s;o complete a victory, that night alone &s;aved their whole army from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Au&s;trians in another part of the empire, were victorious, and had taken the prince of Bevern, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia's genera|li&s;&s;imo, pri&s;oner. The king having ju&s;t fought a battle, again undertook a dreadful march of two hundred miles in the depth of winter, and came up with the Au&s;trian army near Bre&s;lau. He there di&s;po&s;ed his forces with his u&s;ual ce|lerity and judgment, and obtained another bloody victory, in which he took not le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and pri&s;oners. Bre&s;lau, with a garri&s;on of ten thou&s;and men, &s;urrendered &s;oon after. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es di&s;pirited the enemy, and gave his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Hanoverian allies fre&s;h hopes of being able to expel the French troops from their territories.</P>
<P>Soon after the capitulation of Clo&s;ter Seven had been &s;igned between the duke of Cumber|land, and the duke of Richelieu, both &s;ides began to complain that the treaty was not &s;trictly ob&s;erved. The Hanoverians exclaimed
<PB N="403" REF="405">
again&s;t the rapacity of the French general, and the brutality of his &s;oldiers. The French retorted the charge again&s;t them, accu&s;ed them of in&s;olence and in&s;urrection, and re&s;olved to bind them &s;trictly to the terms of their agree|ment, &s;en&s;ible of their own &s;uperiority. Trea|ties between nations are &s;eldom ob&s;erved any longer than intere&s;t or fear hold the union; and among nations that take every advantage, political faith is a term without meaning. The Hanoverians only wanted a pretext to take arms, and a general to head them. Neither were long wanting. The oppre&s;&s;ions of the tax gatherers, whom the French had appoint|ed, were con&s;idered as &s;o &s;evere, that the army once more ro&s;e to vindicate their free|dom, while Ferdinand, prince of Brun&s;wick, put him&s;elf at their head.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more fortunate for the intere&s;ts of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia than this &s;ud|den in&s;urrection of the Hanoverian forces. From this time he began to oppo&s;e the enemy upon more equal terms; he faced them on every &s;ide, often victorious, &s;ometimes re|pul&s;ed, but ever formidable. Never was the art of war carried to &s;uch a pitch as by him, and it mu&s;t be added, its horrors al&s;o. In this war, Europe &s;aw, with a&s;toni&s;hment,
<PB N="404" REF="406">
campaigns carried on in the mid&s;t of winter, great and bloody battles fought, yet produ|cing no vi&s;ible advantage to the victors. At no time &s;ince the days of heroi&s;m, were &s;uch numbers de&s;troyed, &s;o many towns taken, &s;o many &s;kirmi&s;hes fought, &s;uch &s;tratagems prac|ti&s;ed, or &s;uch intrepidity di&s;covered. Armies were, by the German di&s;cipline, con&s;idered as compo&s;ing one great machine, directed by one commander, and animated by a &s;ingle will. From the commentary of the&s;e campaigns, &s;ucceeding generals will take their le&s;&s;ons of deva&s;tation, and improve upon the arts en|crea&s;ing human calamity.</P>
<P>England was all this time happily retired from the mi&s;eries which oppre&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of Europe; yet from her natural military ar|dour &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous of &s;haring tho&s;e dangers, of which &s;he was only a &s;pectator. This pa&s;&s;ion for &s;haring in a continental war was not le&s;s plea&s;ing to the king of England, from his native attachments, than from a de|&s;ire of revenge upon the plunderers of his country. As &s;oon, therefore, as it was known that prince Ferdinand had put him&s;elf at the head of the Hanoverian army, his Britannic maje&s;ty, in a &s;peech to his parliament, ob|&s;erved, that the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his ally in
<PB N="405" REF="407">
Germany had given an happy turn to his af|fairs, which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to improve. The commons concurred in his &s;entiments, and liberally granted &s;upplies both for the &s;er|vice of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and for enabling the army formed in Hanover to act vigorou&s;ly in conjunction with him.</P>
<P>From &s;ending money over into Germany, the nation began to extend their benefits; and it was &s;oon con&s;idered that men would be a more grateful &s;upply. Mr. Pitt, who had at fir&s;t come into popularity and power by op|po&s;ing &s;uch mea&s;ures, was now prevailed on to enter into them with even greater ardour than any of his predece&s;&s;ors. The hopes of put|ting a &s;peedy end to the war by vigorous mea|&s;ures, the connexions with which he was obliged to co-operate, and perhaps the plea&s;ure he found in plea&s;ing the king, all together in|cited him eagerly to pu&s;h forward a continental war. However, he only con&s;pired with the general inclinations of the people at this time, who, allured by the noble efforts of their only ally, were unwilling to &s;ee him fall a &s;acrifice to the united ambition of his enemies.</P>
<P>In order to indulge this general inclination of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the duke of Marlborough was at fir&s;t &s;ent into Germany with
<PB N="406" REF="408">
&s;mall body of Briti&s;h forces to join with prince Ferdinand, who&s;e activity again&s;t the French began to be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;ome &s;mall &s;ucce&s;&s;es gained by the allied army at Crevelt, the duke of Marlborough dying, his command devolved upon lord George Sack|ville, who was at that time a favourite with the Engli&s;h army. However, a mi&s;under|&s;tanding aro&s;e between him and the com|mander in chief, which &s;oon had an occa&s;ion of being di&s;played at the battle of Minden, which was &s;ought &s;hortly after. The cau&s;e of this &s;ecret di&s;gu&s;t on both &s;ides is not clearly known; it is thought that the ex|ten&s;ive genius, and the inqui&s;itive &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h general, were by no means agreeable to his &s;uperior in command, who hoped to reap &s;ome pecuniary advantages the other was unwilling to permit. Be this as it will, both armies advancing near the town of Minden, the French began the attack with great vi|gour, and a general engagement of the in|fantry en&s;ued. Lord George, at the head of the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian hor&s;e, was &s;tation|ed at &s;ome di&s;tance on the right of the infan|try, from which they were divided by a &s;canty wood that bordered on an heath. The French infantry giving ground, the prince thought
<PB N="407" REF="409">
that this would be a favourable opportunity to pour down the hor&s;e among them, and ac|cordingly &s;ent lord George orders to come on. The&s;e orders were but ill obeyed; and whether they were unintelligible, or con|tradictory, &s;till remains a point for po&s;terity to debate upon. It is certain that lord George &s;hortly after was recalled, tried by a court|martial, found guilty, and declared incapable of &s;erving in any military command for the future. The enemy however were repul&s;|ed in all their attacks with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and at length giving way were pur&s;ued to the very ramparts of Minden. The vic|tory was &s;plendid, but laurels were the only advantage reaped from the field of battle.</P>
<P>After the&s;e victories, which were greatly magnified in England, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that one reinforcement more of Briti&s;h troops would terminate the war in favour of the allies, and a reinforcement was quickly &s;ent. The Bri|ti&s;h army in Germany now, therefore, amount|ed to above thirty thou&s;and men, and the whole nation was flu&s;hed with the hopes of immediate conque&s;t. But the&s;e hopes &s;oon vani&s;hed in finding victory and defeat &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively following each other. The allies were wor&s;ted at Corbach; but retrieved their
<PB N="408" REF="410">
honour at Exdorf. A victory at Warbourg followed &s;hortly after, and another at Zieren|berg; but then they &s;uffered a defeat at Com|pen, after which both &s;ides went into winter|quarters. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es thus on either &s;ide might be con&s;idered as a compact by which both engaged to lo&s;e much, and gain little; for no advantages whatever followed from victory. The Engli&s;h at length began to open their eyes to their own intere&s;t, and found that they were waging unequal war, and loading them&s;elves with taxes for conque&s;ts that they could neither pre&s;erve nor enjoy.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the efforts of Eng|land, at this time, over every part of the globe, were amazing; and the expence of her ope|rations greater than had ever been di&s;bur&s;ed by any nation before. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia received a &s;ub&s;idy; a large body of Engli&s;h forces commanded the exten&s;ive penin&s;ula of India; another army of twenty thou|&s;and men confirmed their conque&s;ts in North America; there were thirty thou&s;and men em|ployed in Germany, and &s;everal other bodies di&s;per&s;ed in the different garri&s;ons in various parts of the world; but all the&s;e were nothing to the force maintained at &s;ea, which carried command wherever it came, and had totally annihilated the French power on that element.
<PB N="409" REF="411">
The courage and the conduct of the Engli&s;h admirals had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed whatever had been read of in hi&s;tory; neither &s;uperior force, nor number, nor even the terrors of the tempe&s;t, could intimidate them. Admiral Hawke gain|ed a complete victory over an equal number of French &s;hips, on the coa&s;t of Bretagne in Quiberon bay, in the mid&s;t of a tempe&s;t, during the darkne&s;s of the night, and what a &s;eamen fears &s;till more, upon a rocky &s;hore.</P>
<P>Such was the glorious figure the Briti&s;h na|tion appeared in to all the world at this time. But while their arms pro&s;pered in every effort tending to the real intere&s;ts of the nation, an event happened, which for a while ob&s;cured the &s;plendour of her victories. On the twenty|fifth of October, the king, without having complained of any previous di&s;order, was found, by his dome&s;tics, expiring in his cham|ber. He had ari&s;en at his u&s;ual hour, and ob&s;erved to his attendants, that as the weather was fine he would take a walk into the gardens of Ken&s;ington, where he then re&s;ided. In a few minutes after his return, being left alone, he was heard to fall down upon the floor. The noi&s;e of this bringing his attendants into the room, they lifted him into bed, where he de&s;ired, with a faint voice, that the prince&s;s Amelia might be &s;ent for, but before &s;he could reach the
<PB N="410" REF="412">
apartment he expired. An attempt was made to bleed him, but without effect; and after|wards, the &s;urgeons, upon opening him, di&s;|covered that the right ventricle of the heart was actually ruptured, and that a great quan|tity of blood was di&s;charged through the aper|ture.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="Oct. 25, 1760."> George the &s;econd died in the &s;eventy-&s;eventh year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign; lamented by his &s;ubjects, and in the mid&s;t of victory. If any monarch was happy in the peculiar mode of his death, and the preci&s;e time of its arrival, it was he. The univer&s;al enthu&s;ia&s;m of the people for conque&s;t, was now beginning to &s;ub&s;ide, and &s;ober rea&s;on to take her turn in the admi|ni&s;tration of affairs. The factions which had been nur&s;ing during his long reign, had not yet come to maturity; but threatened, with all their virulence, to afflict his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He was him&s;elf of no &s;hining abilities; and while he was permitted to guide and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Ger|man dominions, he entru&s;ted the care of Bri|tain to his mini&s;ters at home. However, as we &s;tand too near to be impartial judges of his merits or defects, let us &s;tate his character as delivered by two writers of oppo&s;ite opinions.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">"On whatever &s;ide, &s;ays his panegyri&s;t, we look upon his character, we &s;hall find
<PB N="411" REF="413" MS="y">
ample matter for ju&s;t and un&s;u&s;pected prai&s;e. None of his predece&s;&s;ors on the throne of England, lived to &s;o great an age, or enjoyed longer felicity. His &s;ubjects were &s;till improving under him, in com|merce and arts; and his own oeconomy &s;et a prudent example to the nation, which, however, they did not follow. He was, in his temper, &s;udden and violent; but this, though it influenced his conduct, made no change in his behaviour, which was general|ly guided by rea&s;on. He was plain and direct in his intentions; true to his word, &s;teady in his favour and protection to his &s;ervants, nor parting even with his mini&s;ters till compelled to it by the violence of faction. In &s;hort, through the whole of his life he appeared rather to live for the cultivation of u&s;eful virtues than &s;plendid ones; and &s;atisfied with being good, left others their unenvied greatne&s;s."</Q></P>
<P>Such is the picture given by his friends, but there are others who rever&s;e the medal.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As to the extent of his under&s;tanding, or the &s;plendour of his virtue, we rather wi&s;h for opportunities of prai&s;e, than undertake the ta&s;k our&s;elves. His public character was marked with a predilection for his na|tive
<PB N="412" REF="414">
country, and to that he &s;acrificed all other con&s;iderations. He was not only un|learned him&s;elf, but he de&s;pi&s;ed learning in others; and though genius might have flou|ri&s;hed in his reign, yet he neither promoted it by his influence or example. His frugality bordered upon avarice, and he hoarded not for his &s;ubjects, but him&s;elf. He was re|markable for no one great virtue, and was known to practi&s;e &s;everal of the meaner vices."</Q>
Which of the&s;e two characters are true, or whether they may not in part be both &s;o, I will not pretend to decide. If his favourers are numerous, &s;o are tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them; let po&s;terity, therefore, decide the conte&s;t.</P>
