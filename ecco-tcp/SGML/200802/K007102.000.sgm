<HEAD>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, M.B.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the&s;e Memoirs, which were publi&s;hed in London, &s;oon after the death of Dr. Gold&s;mith, were &s;everal mi&s;takes, with re|&s;pect to our author's age, the time of his admi&s;&s;ion into the col|lege of Dublin, &amp;c. which are here corrected from accurate in|formation.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>OLIVER GOLDSMITH, &s;on of the Reverend Charles Gold&s;mith, was born at Elphin, in the county of Ro&s;common in Ireland, in the year 1729. His fa|ther had four &s;ons, of whom Oliver was the third. After being well in&s;tructed in the cla&s;&s;ics, at the &s;chool of Mr. Hughes, he was admitted a &s;izer in
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
Trinity-college, Dublin, on the 11th of June, 1744. While he re&s;ided there, he exhibited no &s;pecimens of that genius, which, in his maturer years, rai&s;ed his character &s;o high. On the 27th of February, 1749, O. S. (two years after the regular time) he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Soon after, he turned his thoughts to the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic; and, after attending &s;ome cour&s;es of anatomy in Dublin, proceeded to Edinburgh, in the year 1751, where he &s;tudied the &s;everal branches of medicine un|der the different profe&s;&s;ors in that univer&s;ity. His beneficent di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon involved him in unex|pected difficulties; and he was obliged precipitately to leave Scotland, in con&s;equence of having engaged him&s;elf to pay a con&s;iderable &s;um of money for a fel|low-&s;tudent.</P>
<P>A FEW days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at Sunderland, near Newca&s;tle, where he was arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of one Barclay, a taylor in Edinburgh, to whom he had given &s;ecurity for his friend. By the friend&s;hip of Mr. Laughlin Maclane and Dr. Sleigh, who were then in the col|lege, he was &s;oon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his pa&s;&s;age on board a Dutch &s;hip to Rotterdam, where, after a &s;hort &s;tay, he proceeded to Bru&s;&s;els. He then vi&s;ited great part of Flanders; and, after pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time at Stra&s;bourg and Lou|vain, where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in phy|&s;ic, he accompanied an Engli&s;h gentleman to Geneva.</P>

He had &s;ome knowledge of the French language, and of mu&s;ic; he played tolerably well on the German flute; which, from an amu&s;ement, became at &s;ome times the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. His learning produced him an ho&s;pi|table reception at mo&s;t of the religious hou&s;es that he vi&s;ited; and his mu&s;ic made him welcome to the pea|&s;ants of Flanders and Germany. <Q REND="inline">'Whenever I ap|proached a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e towards night-fall,'</Q> he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">'I played one of my mo&s;t merry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence for the next day: but <HI>in truth</HI>'</Q> (his con&s;tant ex|pre&s;&s;ion) <Q REND="inline">'I mu&s;t own, whenever I attempted to en|tertain per&s;ons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to plea&s;e them.'</Q></P>
<P>ON his arrival at Geneva, he was recommended as a proper per&s;on for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a con&s;iderable &s;um of money by his uncle Mr. S******. This youth, who was articled to an attorney, on receipt of his fortune determined to &s;ee the world; and, on his engaging with his preceptor, made a provi&s;o, that he
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
&s;hould be permitted to govern him&s;elf: and our travel|ler &s;oon found his pupil under&s;tood the art of direct|ing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>DURING Gold&s;mith's continuance in Switzerland, he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given &s;ome &s;triking proofs at the college of Edinburgh. It was from hence he &s;ent the fir&s;t &s;ketch of his delightful epi&s;tle, called the <HI>Traveller,</HI> to his brother Henry, a clergyman in Ireland.</P>
<P>FROM Geneva Mr. Gold&s;mith and his pupil pro|ceeded to the &s;outh of France, where the young man, upon &s;ome di&s;agreement with his preceptor, paid him the &s;mall part of his &s;alary which was due, and embarked at Mar&s;eilles for England. Our wanderer was left once more upon the world at large, and pa&s;&s;ed through a number of difficulties in traver&s;ing the greate&s;t part of France. At length his curio&s;ity being gratified, he bent his cour&s;e towards England, and arrived at Dover, the beginning of the winter, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>HIS finances were &s;o low on his return to Eng|land, that he with difficulty got to the metropolis, his whole &s;tock of ca&s;h amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire &s;tranger in London, his mind was filled with the mo&s;t gloomy reflections in con&s;e|quence of his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation! He applied to &s;e|veral apothecaries in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman, but his broad Iri&s;h accent, and the uncouthne&s;s of his appearance, occa&s;ioned him to meet with in&s;ult from mo&s;t of the medicinal tribe. The next day, however, a chymi&s;t near Fi&s;h-&s;treet,
<PB N="v" REF="7">
&s;truck with his forlorn condition, and the &s;implicity of his manner, took him into his laboratory, where he continued till he di&s;covered that his old friend Dr. Sleigh was in London. That gentleman received him with the warme&s;t affection, and liberally invited him to &s;hare his pur&s;e till &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment could be pro|cured for him. Gold&s;mith, unwilling to be a burden to his friend, a &s;hort time after eagerly embraced an offer which was made him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the late Rev. Dr. Milner, in in&s;tructing the young gentlemen at the Academy at Peckham; and acquitted him&s;elf greatly to the Doctor's &s;atisfaction for a &s;hort time; but, hav|ing obtained &s;ome reputation by the critici&s;ms he had written in the Monthly Review, Mr. Griffith, the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, re&s;olving to pur&s;ue the profe&s;&s;ion of writ|ing, he returned to London, as the mart where abili|ties of every kind were &s;ure of meeting di&s;tinction and reward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, and, at the clo&s;e of the year 1759, took lodgings in Green-Arbour-court in the Old Bailey, where he wrote &s;everal ingenious pieces. The late Mr. Newbery, who, at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and introduced him as one of the writers in the Public Ledger, in which his <HI>Citizen of the World</HI> originally appeared, un|der the title of 'Chine&s;e Letters.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During this time, (according to another account) he wrote for the Briti&s;h Magazine, of which Dr. Smollet was then Editor, mo&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> and <HI>Tales,</HI> which he afterwards collected and publi&s;hed in a &s;eparate volume. He al&s;o wrote occa&s;ionally, for the Critical Review; and it was the merit which he di&s;covered in critici&s;ing a de&s;picable tran&s;lation of Ovid's <HI>Fa&s;ti</HI> by a pedantic &s;chool-ma&s;ter, and his <HI>Enquiry into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of learning in Europe,</HI> which fir&s;t introduced him to the acquaintance of Dr. Smollet, who recommended him to &s;everal literati, and to mo&s;t of the book&s;ellers by whom he was afterwards patronized.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="8">
FORTUNE now &s;eemed to take &s;ome notice of a man &s;he had long neglected. The &s;implicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the merit of his productions, made his company very acceptable to a number of re&s;pectable per&s;ons; and, about the mid|dle of the year 1762, he emerged from his mean apartments near the Old Bailey to the politer air of the Temple, where he took hand&s;ome chambers, and lived in a genteel &s;tyle. The publication of his <HI>Tra|veller,</HI> his <HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>Hi&s;tory of Eng|land,</HI> was followed by the performance of his comedy of <HI>the Good natured Man</HI> at Covent Garden theatre, and placed him in the fir&s;t rank of the poets of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>OUR Doctor, as he was now univer&s;ally called, had a con&s;tant levee of his di&s;tre&s;t countrymen, who&s;e wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he has been often known to leave him&s;elf even with|out a guinea, in order to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of others.</P>
<P>ANOTHER feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> the book&s;eller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy, which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who ob&s;erved it was a very great &s;um for &s;o &s;hort a performance. <Q REND="inline">'In truth,'</Q> replied Gold&s;mith, <Q REND="inline">'I think &s;o too, it is much more than the hone&s;t man can afford, or the piece is worth; I have not been
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
ea&s;y &s;ince I received it; I will therefore go back and return him his note:'</Q> which he actually did, and left it entirely to the book&s;eller to pay him according to the profits produced by the &s;ale of the poem, which turned out very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>DURING the la&s;t rehear&s;al of his comedy, intitled, <HI>She &s;toops to Conquer,</HI> which Mr. Coleman thought would not &s;ucceed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of Tony Lumpkin's &s;peeches, being apprehen&s;ive it might injure the play, the Manager, with great keenne&s;s replied, <Q REND="inline">'P&s;ha, my dear Doctor, do not be fearful of <HI>&s;quibs,</HI> when we have been &s;itting almo&s;t the&s;e two hours upon a <HI>barrel of gunpowder.</HI>'</Q> The piece, however, contrary to Mr. Coleman's ex|pectation, was received with uncommon applau&s;e by the audience; and Gold&s;mith's pride was &s;o hurt by the &s;everity of the above ob&s;ervation, that it entirely put an end to his friend&s;hip for the gentleman who made it.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great &s;ucce&s;s of his pieces, by &s;ome of which, it is a&s;&s;erted, upon good authority, he cleared 1800 l. in one year, his cir|cum&s;tances were by no means in a pro&s;perous &s;itua|tion! partly owing to the liberality of his di&s;po&s;iti|on, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had con|tracted of gaming, with the arts of which he was very little acquainted, and con&s;equently became the prey of tho&s;e who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his ignorance.</P>
<P>JUST before his death he had formed a de&s;ign for executing an univer&s;al dictionary of arts and &s;ciences,
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
the <HI>pro&s;pectus</HI> of which he actually printed and di&s;tributed among his acquaintance. In this work &s;e|veral of his literary friends (particularly Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Dr. John&s;on, Mr. Beauclerc, and Mr. Gar|rick) had promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and to furni&s;h him with articles upon different &s;ubjects. He had entertained the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations from the &s;ucce&s;s of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the book&s;ellers which he had im|agined it would undoubtedly receive; and he u&s;ed to lament this circum&s;tance almo&s;t to the la&s;t hour of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>HE had been for &s;ome years afflicted, at different times, with a violent &s;trangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life; and which, united with the vexations he &s;uffered upon other occa&s;ions, brought on a kind of habitual de&s;pondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, terminated in his di&s;&s;olution on the 4th day of April, 1774, in the forty-fifth year of his age. His friends, who were very numerous and re&s;pecta|ble, had determined to bury him in We&s;tmin&s;ter-ab|bey, where a tablet was to have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been &s;upported by Lord Shelburne, Lord Louth, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, the Hon. Mr. Beauclerc, Mr. Edmond Burke, and Mr. Garrick; but from &s;ome unaccountable circum|&s;tances this de&s;ign was dropped, and his remains were privately depo&s;ited in the Temple burial-ground.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ub&s;cription, however, has &s;ince been rai&s;ed by his friends, to defray the expence of a marble monument which is now executed by Mr. Nollikens, an eminent Statuary in London, and is &s;hortly to be placed in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, with the follow|ing in&s;cription, written by Dr. Samuel John&s;on.

AS to his character, it is &s;trongly illu&s;trated by Mr. Pope's line,
<Q><L>'In wit a man, &s;implicity a child.'</L></Q></P>
<P>THE learned lei&s;ure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by di&s;tre&s;&s;es which aro&s;e from the openne&s;s of his temper, and which &s;ometimes threw him into loud fits of pa&s;&s;ion; but this impetuo&s;ity was corrected upon a moment's reflection, and his &s;ervants have been known, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, purpo&s;ely to throw them&s;elves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was certain of being rewarded for it. His di&s;appointments at other times, made him peevi&s;h and &s;ullen, and he has often left a party of convivial friends abruptly in the evening,
<PB N="x" REF="12">
in order to go home and brood over his misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al e&s;teem in which his poems are held, and the repeated plea&s;ure they give in the peru|&s;al, are &s;triking proofs of their merit. He was a &s;tudious and correct ob&s;erver of nature, happy in the &s;election of his images, in the choice of his &s;ubjects, and in the harmony of his ver&s;ification; and, though his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation prevented him from putting the la&s;t hand to many of his productions, his <HI>Her|mit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among the mo&s;t fini&s;hed pieces in the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P>AS different accounts have been given of this in|genious man, the writer of <HI>the&s;e</HI> anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring, that they are all found|ed upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the mo&s;t friendly footing for a great number of years, and who never felt any &s;orrow more &s;en&s;ibly than that which was occa&s;ioned by his death.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS there is nothing I di&s;like &s;o much as news-paper controver&s;y, particularly upon trifles, permit me to be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible in informing a corre&s;pondent of yours, that I recommended Blainville's Travels, be|cau&s;e I thought the book was a good one; and I think &s;o &s;till. I &s;aid, I was told by the book&s;eller that it was then fir&s;t publi&s;hed; but in that, it &s;eems, I was mi&s;in|formed, and my reading was not exten&s;ive enough to &s;et me right.</P>
<P>Another corre&s;pondent of yours accu&s;es me of hav|ing taken a ballad, I publi&s;hed &s;ome time ago, from one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Friar of Orders Gray.&mdash;<HI>Reliq. of Anc. Poetry,</HI> vol. 1, p. 243.</NOTE> by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not think there is any great re&s;emblance between the two pieces
<PB N="16" REF="26">
in que&s;tion. If there be any, his ballad is taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy, &s;ome years ago; and he (as we both con&s;idered the&s;e things as trifles at be&s;t) told me, with his u&s;ual good humour, the next time I &s;aw him, that he had taken my plan to form the frag|ments of Shake&s;peare into a ballad of his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may &s;o call it, and I highly approved it. Such petty anecdotes as the&s;e are &s;carce worth printing: and, were it not for the bu&s;y di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of your corre&s;pondents, the public &s;hould never have known that he owes me the hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to his friend&s;hip and learning for communications of a much more important nature.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE REV. HENRY GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that the friend&s;hip between us can ac|quire no new force from the ceremonies of a Dedica|tion; and perhaps it demands an excu&s;e thus to prefix your name to my attempts, which you decline giving with your own. But as a part of this Poem was for|merly written to you from Switzerland, the whole can now, with propriety, be only in&s;cribed to you. It will al&s;o throw a light upon many parts of it, when the reader under&s;tands, that it is addre&s;&s;ed to a man, who, de&s;pi&s;ing Fame and Fortune, has retired early to Happine&s;s and Ob&s;curity, with an income of forty pounds a year.</P>
<P>I now perceive, my dear brother, the wi&s;dom of your humble choice. You have entered upon a &s;a|cred office, where the harve&s;t is great, and the la|bourers are but few; while you have left the field of Ambition, where the labourers are many, and the harve&s;t not worth carrying away. But of all kinds of ambition, what from the refinement of the times, from different &s;y&s;tems of critici&s;m, and from the
<PB N="30" REF="39">
divi&s;ions of party, that which pur&s;ues poetical fame is the wilde&s;t.</P>
<P>Poetry makes a principal amu&s;ement among unpo|li&s;hed nations; but in a country verging to the ex|tremes of refinement, Painting and Mu&s;ic come in for a &s;hare. As the&s;e offer the feeble mind a le&s;s labori|ous entertainment, they at fir&s;t rival Poetry, and at length &s;upplant her; they engro&s;s all that favour once &s;hewn to her, and though but younger &s;i&s;ters, &s;eize upon the elder's birth-right.</P>
<P>Yet, however this art may be neglected by the powerful, it is &s;till in greater danger from the mi&s;taken efforts of the learned to improve it. What critici&s;ms have we not heard of late in favour of blank ver&s;e, and Pindaric odes, choru&s;&s;es, anape&s;ts and iambics, alliterative care and happy negligence! Every ab&s;ur|dity has now a champion to defend it, and as he is generally much in the wrong, &s;o he has always much to &s;ay; for error is ever talkative.</P>
<P>But there is an enemy to this art &s;till more danger|ous, I mean Party. Party entirely di&s;torts the judg|ment, and de&s;troys the ta&s;te. When the mind is once infected with this di&s;ea&s;e, it can only find plea&s;ure in what contributes to increa&s;e the di&s;temper. Like the tyger, that &s;eldom de&s;i&s;ts from pur&s;uing man after having once preyed upon human fle&s;h, the reader, who has once gratified his appetite with calumny, makes, ever after, the mo&s;t agreeable fea&s;t upon mur|dered reputation. Such readers generally admire &s;ome half-witted thing, who wants to be thought a bold man, having lo&s;t the character of a wi&s;e one. Him they dignify with the name of poet; his tawdry
<PB N="31" REF="40">
lampoons are called &s;atires, his turbulence is &s;aid to be force, and his phrenzy fire.</P>
<P>What reception a Poem may find, which has nei|ther abu&s;e, party, nor blank ver&s;e to &s;upport it, I can|not tell, nor am I &s;olicitous to know. My aims are right. Without e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of any party, I have attempted to moderate the rage of all. I have endeavoured to &s;hew, that there may be equal happi|ne&s;s in &s;tates, that are differently governed from our own; that every &s;tate has a particular principle of happine&s;s, and that this principle in each may be car|ried to a mi&s;chievous exce&s;s. There are few can judge, better than your&s;elf, how far the&s;e po&s;itions are illu&s;trated in this Poem. I am,</P>

<P>I CAN have no expectations in an addre&s;s of this kind, either to add to your reputation, or to e&s;tabli&s;h my own. You can gain nothing from my admira|tion, as I am ignorant of that art in which you are &s;aid to excel; and I may lo&s;e much by the &s;everity of your judgment, as few have a ju&s;ter ta&s;te in poetry than you. Setting intere&s;t therefore a&s;ide, to which I never paid much attention, I mu&s;t be indulged at pre&s;ent in following my affections. The only dedi|cation I ever made was to my brother, becau&s;e I lov|ed him better than mo&s;t other men. He is &s;ince dead. Permit me to in&s;cribe this poem to you.</P>
<P>How far you may be plea&s;ed with the ver&s;ification and meer mechanical parts of this attempt, I don't pretend to inquire; but I know you will object (and indeed &s;everal of our be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t friends concur in the opinion) that the depopulation it deplores is no where to be &s;een, and the di&s;orders it laments are on|ly to be found in the poet's own imagination. To this I can &s;carce make any other an&s;wer than that I &s;incerely believe what I have written; that I have taken all po&s;&s;ible pains, in my country excur&s;ions, for
<PB N="52" REF="58">
the&s;e four or five years pa&s;t, to be certain of what I allege, and that all my views and inquiries have led me to believe tho&s;e mi&s;eries real, which I here at|tempt to di&s;play. But this is not the place to enter into an inquiry, whether the country be depopulat|ing, or not; the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion would take up much room, and I &s;hould prove my&s;elf, at be&s;t, an indifferent poli|tician, to tire the reader with a long preface, when I want his unfatigued attention to a long poem:</P>
<P>In regretting the depopulation of the country, I in|veigh again&s;t the increa&s;e of our luxuries; and here al&s;o I expect the &s;hout of modern politicians again&s;t me. For twenty or thirty years pa&s;t, it has been the fa&s;hion to con&s;ider luxury as one of the greate&s;t nati|onal advantages; and all the wi&s;dom of antiquity in that particular, as erroneous. Still, however, I mu&s;t remain a profe&s;&s;ed ancient on that head, and continue to think tho&s;e luxuries prejudicial to &s;tates, by which &s;o many vices are introduced, and &s;o many kingdoms have been undone. Indeed &s;o much has been poured out of late on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, that, meerly for the &s;ake of novelty and variety, one would &s;ometimes wi&s;h to be in the right. I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE HAUNCH OF VENISON, A POETIC EPISTLE, TO LORD CLARE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THANKS, my lord, for your veni&s;on, for finer or fatter</L>
<L>Never rang'd in a fore&s;t, or &s;moak'd in a platter;</L>
<L>The haunch was a picture for painters to &s;tudy,</L>
<L>The fat was &s;o white, and the lean was &s;o ruddy,</L>
<L>Tho' my &s;tomach was &s;harp, I could &s;carce help re|gretting,</L>
<L>To &s;poil &s;uch a delicate picture by eating;</L>
<L>I had thoughts, in my chambers, to place it in view,</L>
<L>To be &s;hewn to my friends as a piece of virtu:</L>
<L>As in &s;ome Iri&s;h hou&s;es, where things are &s;o &s;o,</L>
<L>One gammon of bacon hangs up for a &s;how:</L>
<L>But, for eating a ra&s;her of what they take pride in,</L>

<L><PB N="74" REF="79">

<L>This tale of the bacon's a damnable bounce;</L>

<L>By a bounce now and then, to get courage to fly.</L>

<L>I thought of a friend that was tru&s;ty and &s;taunch,</L>
<L>So I cut it, and &s;ent it to Reynolds undre&s;t,</L>
<L>To paint it, or eat it, ju&s;t as he lik'd be&s;t.</L>
<L>Of the neck and the brea&s;t I had next to di&s;po&s;e;</L>
<L>'Twas a neck and a brea&s;t that might rival Monroe's:</L>
<L>But in parting with the&s;e I was puzzled again,</L>
<L>With the how, and the who, and the where, and the when.</L>
<L>There's H&mdash;d, and C&mdash;y, and H&mdash;rth, and H&mdash;ff,</L>
<L>I think they love veni&s;on&mdash;I know they love beef.</L>
<L>There's my countryman Higgins&mdash;Oh! let him alone,</L>
<L>For making a blunder, or picking a bone.</L>

<L>Your very good mutton's a very good treat;</L>
<L>Such dainties to them their health it might hurt,</L>
<L>It's like &s;ending them ruffles, when wanting a &s;hirt.</L>

<L>Your own I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;or is it in waiting?</L>

<L>And, now that I think on't, as I am a &s;inner!</L>
<L>We wanted this veni&s;on to make out the dinner.</L>
<L>What &s;ay you&mdash;a pa&s;ty, it &s;hall, and it mu&s;t,</L>

<L>They enter'd, and dinner was &s;erv'd as they came.</L>

<L>At the top a fried liver, and bacon were &s;een,</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook to write a comedy, I con|fe&s;s I was &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the poets of the la&s;t age, and &s;trove to imitate them. The term, genteel comedy, was then unknown among&s;t us, and little more was de&s;ired by an audience, than nature and humour, in whatever walks of life they were mo&s;t con&s;picuous. The author of the follow|ing &s;cenes never imagined that more would be ex|pected of him, and therefore to delineate character has been his principal aim. Tho&s;e who know any thing of compo&s;ition, are &s;en&s;ible, that in pur&s;uing humour, it will &s;ometimes lead us into the rece&s;&s;es of the mean; I was even tempted to look for it in the ma&s;ter of a &s;punging-hou&s;e: but in deference to the public ta&s;te, grown of late, perhaps, too delicate; the &s;cene of the bailiffs was retrenched in the re|pre&s;entation. In deference al&s;o to the judgment of a few friends, who think in a particular way, the &s;cene is here re&s;tored. The author &s;ubmits it to the reader in his clo&s;et; and hopes that too much refinement will not bani&s;h humour and character from ours, as it has already done from the French theatre. Indeed the French comedy is now become &s;o very elevated and &s;entimental, that it has not only bani&s;hed hu|mour and Moliere from the &s;tage, but it has bani&s;h|ed all &s;pectators too.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">
Upon the whole, the author returns his thanks to the public for the favourable reception which the Good-Natur'd Man has met with: and to Mr. Col|man in particular, for his kindne&s;s to it. It may not al&s;o be improper to a&s;&s;ure any, who &s;hall hereafter write for the theatre, that merit, or &s;uppo&s;ed merit, will ever be a &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;port to his protection.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD Jarvis, make no apologies for this hone&s;t bluntne&s;s. Fidelity, like yours, is the be&s;t excu&s;e for every freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help being blunt, and being very angry too, when I hear you talk of di&s;inheriting &s;o good, &s;o wor|thy a young gentleman as your nephew, my ma&s;ter. All the world loves him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather, that he loves all the world; that is his fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm &s;ure there is no part of it more dear to him than you are, tho' he has not &s;een you &s;ince he was a child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="104" REF="105">
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;ignifies his affection to me; or how can I be proud of a place in a heart where every &s;harper and coxcomb find an ea&s;y entrance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant you that he's rather too good-natur'd; that he's too much every man's man; that he laughs this minute with one, and cries the next with another; but who&s;e in&s;tructions may he thank for all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not mine, &s;ure? My letters to him during my em|ployment in Italy, taught him only that philo&s;ophy which might prevent, not defend his errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, begging your honour's pardon, I'm &s;orry they taught him any philo&s;ophy at all; it has only &s;erv'd to &s;poil him. This &s;ame philo&s;ophy is a good hor&s;e in the &s;table, but an errant jade on a journey. For my own part, whenever I hear him mention the name on't, I'm always &s;ure he's going to play the fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let us a&s;cribe his faults to his philo&s;ophy, I entreat you. No, Jarvis, his good nature ari&s;es ra|ther from his fears of offending the importunate, than his de&s;ire of making the de&s;erving happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>What it ri&s;es from, I don't know. But, to be &s;ure, every body has it, that a&s;ks it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, or that does not a&s;k it. I have been now for &s;ome time a concealed &s;pectator of his follies, and find them as boundle&s;s as his di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="105" REF="106">
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, faith, he has &s;ome fine name or other for them all. He calls his extravagance, genero&s;ity; and his tru&s;ting every body, univer&s;al benevolence. It was but la&s;t week he went &s;ecurity for a fellow who&s;e face he &s;carce knew, and that he called an act of exalted mu&mdash;mu&mdash;munificence; ay, that was the name he gave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon that I proceed, as my la&s;t effort, tho' with very little hopes to reclaim him. That very fellow has ju&s;t ab&s;conded, and I have taken up the &s;e|curity. Now, my intention is to involve him in fic|titious di&s;tre&s;s, before he has plunged him&s;elf into real calamity. To arre&s;t him for that very debt, to clap an officer upon him, and then let him &s;ee which of his friends will come to his relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I could but any way &s;ee him thoroughly vexed, every groan of his would be mu&s;ic to me; yet faith, I believe it impo&s;&s;ible. I have tried to fret him my&s;elf every morning the&s;e three years; but, in&s;tead of being angry, he &s;its as calmly to hear me &s;cold, as he does to his hair-dre&s;&s;er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t try him once more, however, and I'll go this in&s;tant to put my &s;cheme into execution; and I don't de&s;pair of &s;ucceeding, as, by your means, I can have frequent opportunities of being about him, without being known. What a pity it is, Jarvis, that any man's good will to others &s;hould produce &s;o much neglect of him&s;elf, as to require correction. Yet, we mu&s;t touch his weakne&s;&s;es with a delicate

hand. There are &s;ome faults &s;o nearly allied to ex|cellence, that we can &s;carce weed out the vice with|out eradicating the virtue. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>JARVIS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go thy ways, &s;ir William Honeywood. It is not without rea&s;on that the world allows thee to be the be&s;t of men. But here comes his hopeful ne|phew; the &s;trange, good-natur'd, fooli&s;h, open-heart|ed&mdash;And yet, all his faults are &s;uch that one loves him &s;till the better for them.</P>

<P>But won't your refu&s;ing mi&s;s Richland, for whom you know the old gentleman intends you, create a &s;u&s;picion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, there's my ma&s;ter-&s;troke. I have re&s;olv|ed not to refu&s;e her; nay, an hour hence I have con|&s;ented to go with my father, to make her an offer of my heart and fortune.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your heart and fortune!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't be alarm'd, my deare&s;t. Can Olivia think &s;o meanly of my honour, or my love, as to &s;uppo&s;e I could ever hope for happine&s;s from any but her? No, my Olivia, neither the force, nor, permit me to add, the delicacy of my pa&s;&s;ion, leave any room to &s;u&s;pect me. I only offer mi&s;s Richland an heart, I am convinc'd &s;he will refu&s;e; as I am confident, that, without knowing it, her affections are fixed upon Mr. Honeywood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Honeywood! You'll excu&s;e my apprehen&s;i|ons; but when your merits come to be put in the balance&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You view them with too much partiality. How|ever, by making this offer, I &s;hew a &s;eeming com|pliance with my father's command; and perhaps, up|on her refu&s;al, I may have his con&s;ent to chu&s;e for my&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>OLIVIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I &s;ubmit. And yet, my Leontine, I own, I &s;hall envy her, even your pretended addre&s;&s;es. I
<PB N="121" REF="122">
con&s;ider every look, every expre&s;&s;ion of your e&s;teem, as due only to me. This is folly perhaps: I allow it; but it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that merit which has made an impre&s;&s;ion on one's own heart, may be pow|erful over that of another.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LEONTINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't, my life's trea&s;ure, don't let us make imagi|nary evils, when you know we have &s;o many real ones to encounter. At wor&s;t, you know, if mi&s;s Richland &s;hould con&s;ent, or my father refu&s;e his par|don, it can but end in a trip to Scotland; and&mdash;</P>

<P>I have told you, and tell you again, boy, that mi&s;s Richland's fortune mu&s;t not go out of the fa|mily; one may find comfort in the money, whatever one does in the wife.</P>

<P>I'll tell you once for all how it &s;tands.

One half of this &s;he is to forfeit, by her father's will, in ca&s;e &s;he refu&s;es to marry you.

<P>Why, madam, as I told you before, in&s;tead of go|ing to Lyons, to bring home his &s;i&s;ter, who has been there with her aunt the&s;e ten years; he never went further than Paris; there he &s;aw and fell in love with this young lady, by the bye, of a prodigious family.</P>

<P>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune. My &s;on is not to live by his learning. I don't think a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learning, quotha! A mere compo&s;ition of tricks and mi&s;chief.</P>

<P>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come, Mr. Hardca&s;tle, you mu&s;t allow the boy a little hu|mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd &s;ooner allow him an hor&s;e-pond. If burning the footmens &s;hoes, frighting the maids, and worry|ing the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but ye&s;terday he fa&s;tened my wig to the back of my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always too &s;ickly to do any good. A &s;chool would be his death. When he comes to be a little &s;tronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Never.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's a very &s;ingular character, I a&s;&s;ure you. Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the mode&s;te&s;t man alive; but his acquaintance give him a very dif|ferent character among creatures of another &s;tamp: you under&s;tand me.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MISS NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fortune like mine, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in jewels, is no &s;uch mighty temptation.

<P>The Engli&s;hman's malady. But tell me, George, where could I have learned that a&s;&s;urance you talk of? My life has been chiefly &s;pent in a college, or an inn, in &s;eclu&s;ion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence.

<P>Never, unle&s;s, as among kings and princes, my bride were to be courted by proxy. If, indeed, like an ea&s;tern bridegroom, one were to be introduced to a wife he never &s;aw before, it might be endured.

All I can do, is to enjoy London at &s;econd-hand. I take care to know every t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te from the &s;candalous ma|gazine, and have all the fa&s;hions, as they come out, in a letter from the two mi&s;s Rickets of Crooked|lane.

<L>That pretty bar-maids have done execution.</L>
<L>Our life is all a play, compos'd to plea&s;e,</L>

Her &s;econd act di&s;plays a livelier &s;cene,&mdash;</L>
<L>Th' unblu&s;hing bar-maid of a country inn,</L>
