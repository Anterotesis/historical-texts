<HEAD>VERSES ON SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS'S PAINTED WINDOW AT NEW-COLLEGE OXFORD.</HEAD>

<L>AH, &s;tay thy treacherous hand, forbear to trace</L>
<L>Tho&s;e faultle&s;s forms of elegance and grace!</L>
<L>Ah, cea&s;e to &s;pread the bright tran&s;parent ma&s;s,</L>
<L>With Titian's pencil, o'er the &s;peaking gla&s;s!</L>
<L>Nor &s;teal, by &s;trokes of art with truth combin'd,</L>
<L>The fond illu&s;ions of my wayward mind!</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">For long, enamour'd of a barbarous age,</L>
<L>A faithle&s;s truant to the cla&s;&s;ic page;</L>
<L>Long have I lov'd to catch the &s;imple chime</L>
<L>Of min&s;trel-harps, and &s;pell the fabling rime;</L>
<L>To view the fe&s;tive rites, the knightly play,</L>
<L>That deck'd heroic Albion's elder day;</L>
<L>To mark the mouldering halls of barons bold,</L>
<L>And the rough ca&s;tle, ca&s;t in giant-mould;</L>
<L>With Gothic manners Gothic arts explore,</L>
<L>And mu&s;e on the magnificence of yore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But chief, enraptur'd have I lov'd to roam,</L>
<L>A lingering votary, the vaulted dome,</L>
<L>Where the tall &s;hafts, that mount in ma&s;&s;y pride,</L>
<L>Their mingling branches &s;hoot from &s;ide to &s;ide;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="5">Where elfin &s;culptors, with fanta&s;tic clew,</L>
<L>Oer the long roof their wild embroidery drew;</L>
<L>Where SUPERSTITION, with capricious hand</L>
<L>In many a maze the wreathed window plann'd,</L>
<L>With hues romantic ting'd the gorgeous pane,</L>
<L>To fill with holy light the wonderous fane;</L>
<L>To aid the builder's model, richly rude,</L>
<L>By no Vitruvian &s;ymmetry &s;ubdued;</L>
<L>To &s;uit the genius of the my&s;tic pile:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t as around the far-retiring ile,</L>
<L>And fretted &s;hrines with hoary trophies hung,</L>
<L>Her dark illumination wide &s;he flung,</L>
<L>With new &s;olemnity, the nooks profound,</L>
<L>The caves of death, and the dim arches frown'd.</L>
<L>From bli&s;s long felt unwillingly we part:</L>
<L>Ah, &s;pare the weakne&s;s of a lover's heart!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="6">Cha&s;e not the phantoms of my fairy dream,</L>
<L>Phantoms that &s;hrink at Rea&s;on's painful gleam!</L>
<L>That &s;ofter touch, in&s;idious arti&s;t, &s;tay,</L>
<L>Nor to new joys my &s;truggling brea&s;t betray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such was a pen&s;ive bard's mi&s;taken &s;train.&mdash;</L>
<L>But, oh, of ravi&s;h'd plea&s;ures why complain?</L>
<L>No more the matchle&s;s &s;kill I call unkind</L>
<L>That &s;trives to di&s;enchant my cheated mind.</L>
<L>For when again I view thy cha&s;te De&s;ign,</L>
<L>The ju&s;t proportion, and the genuin line;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e native pourtraitures of Attic art,</L>
<L>That from the lucid &s;urface &s;eem to &s;tart;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e tints, that &s;teal no glories from the day,</L>
<L>Nor a&s;k the &s;un to lend his &s;treaming ray;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="7">The doubtful radiance of contending dies,</L>
<L>That faintly mingle, yet di&s;tinctly ri&s;e;</L>

<L>The feature blooming with immortal life:</L>
<L>The &s;tole in ca&s;ual foldings taught to flow,</L>
<L>Not with ambitious ornaments to glow;</L>
<L>The tread maje&s;tic, and the beaming eye</L>
<L>That lifted &s;peaks its commerce with the &s;ky:</L>
<L>Sudden, the &s;ombrous imagery is fled,</L>
<L>Which late my vi&s;ionary rapture fed:</L>
<L>Thy powerful hand has broke the Gothic chain,</L>
<L>And brought my bo&s;om back to truth again:</L>
<L>To truth, by no peculiar ta&s;te confin'd,</L>
<L>Who&s;e univer&s;al pattern &s;trikes mankind;</L>
<L>To truth, who&s;e bold and unre&s;i&s;ted aim</L>
<L>Checks frail caprice, and fa&s;hion's fickle claim;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="8">To truth, who&s;e Charms deception's magic quell,</L>

<L>Ye brawny Prophets, that in robes &s;o rich,</L>
<L>At di&s;tance due, po&s;&s;e&s;s the cri&s;ped nich;</L>
<L>Ye Rows of Patriarchs, that &s;ublimely rear'd,</L>
<L>Diffu&s;e a proud primeval length of beard:</L>
<L>Ye Saints, who clad in crim&s;on's bright array,</L>
<L>More pride than humble poverty di&s;play:</L>
<L>Ye Virgins meek, that wear the palmy crown</L>
<L>Of patient faith, and yet &s;o fiercely frown:</L>
<L>Ye Angels, that from golden clouds recline,</L>
<L>But boa&s;t no &s;emblance to a race divine:</L>
<L>Ye tragic Tales of legendary lore,</L>
<L>That draw devotion's ready tear no more:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="9">Ye Martyrdoms of unenlighten'd days,</L>
<L>Ye Miracles, that now no wonder rai&s;e:</L>
<L>Shapes, that with one broad glare the gazer &s;trike,</L>
<L>Kings, Bi&s;hops, Nuns, Apo&s;tles, all alike!</L>
<L>Ye Colours, that th' unwary &s;ight amaze,</L>
<L>And only dazzle in the noontide blaze!</L>
<L>No more the Sacred Window's round di&s;grace,</L>
<L>But yield to Grecian groupes the &s;hining &s;pace.</L>
<L>Lo, from the canvas Beauty &s;hifts her throne,</L>
<L>Lo, Picture's powers a new formation own!</L>
<L>Behold, &s;he prints upon the cry&s;tal plain,</L>
<L>With her own energy, th' expre&s;&s;ive &s;tain!</L>
<L>The mighty Ma&s;ter &s;preads his mimic toil</L>
<L>More wide, nor only blends the breathing oil;</L>
<L>But calls the lineaments of life compleat</L>
<L>From genial alchymy's creative heat;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="10">Obedient forms to the bright fu&s;ion gives,</L>

<LG>
<L>ARTIST, tis thine, from the broad window's height,</L>
<L>To add new lu&s;tre to religious light:</L>
<L>Not of it's pomp to &s;trip this antient &s;hrine,</L>
<L>But bid that pomp with purer radiance &s;hine:</L>
