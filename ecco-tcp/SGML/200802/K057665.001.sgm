<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of mankind is a delight|ful &s;ubject. A rational inquirer is not le&s;s entertained than in&s;tructed, when he traces the gradual progre&s;s of man|ners, of laws, of arts, from their birth to their pre&s;ent maturity. Events and &s;ubor|dinate incidents are, in each of the&s;e, link|ed together, and connected in a regular chain of cau&s;es and effects. Law in parti|cular becomes then only a rational &s;tudy, when it is traced hi&s;torically, from its fir&s;t rudiments among &s;avages, through &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive changes, to its highe&s;t improvements in a civilized &s;ociety. And yet the &s;tudy is &s;eldom conducted in this manner. Law, like geography, is taught as if it were a collection of facts merely: the memory is employed to the full, rarely the judgment.
<PB N="vi" REF="3">
This method, if it were not rendered fami|liar by cu&s;tom, would appear &s;trange and unaccountable. With re&s;pect to the poli|tical con&s;titution of Britain, how imperfect mu&s;t the knowledge be of that man who confines his reading to the pre&s;ent times? If he follow the &s;ame method in &s;tudying its laws, have we rea&s;on to hope that his knowledge of them will be more perfect?</P>
<P>SUCH neglect of the hi&s;tory of law is the more unaccountable, that in place of a dry, intricate and crabbed &s;cience, law treated hi&s;torically becomes an entertaining &s;tudy; entertaining not only to tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion it is, but to every per&s;on who hath any thir&s;t for knowledge. With the bulk of men, it is true, the hi&s;tory of law makes not &s;o great a figure, as the hi&s;tory of wars and conque&s;ts. Singular events, which, by the prevalence of chance and fortune, ex|cite wonder, are greatly reli&s;hed by the vulgar. But readers of &s;olid judgment find more entertainment, in &s;tudying the con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="vii" REF="4">
of a &s;tate, its government, its laws, the manners of its people: where rea&s;on is exerci&s;ed in di&s;covering cau&s;es and tracing effects through a long train of dependencies.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of law, in common with other hi&s;tories, enjoys the privilege of gra|tifying curio&s;ity. It enjoys be&s;ides &s;everal peculiar privileges. The feudal cu&s;toms ought to be the &s;tudy of every man who propo&s;es to reap in&s;truction from the hi&s;|tory of the modern European nations: be|cau&s;e among the&s;e nations, publick tran&s;ac|tions, not le&s;s than private property, were &s;ome centuries ago, regulated by the feudal &s;y&s;tem. Sovereigns formerly were many of them connected by the relation of &s;uperior and va&s;&s;al. The King of England, for ex|ample, by the feudal tenure, held of the French King many fair provinces. The King of Scotland, in the &s;ame manner, held many lands of the Engli&s;h King. The controver&s;ies among the&s;e princes were ge|nerally feudal; and without a thorough
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
knowledge of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, one mu&s;t be ever at a lo&s;s, in forming any accurate notion of &s;uch controver&s;ies, or in apply|ing to them the &s;tandard of right and wrong.</P>
<P>THE feudal &s;y&s;tem is connected with the municipal law of this i&s;land, &s;till more than with the law of nations. It formerly made the chief part of our municipal law, and in Scotland to this day makes &s;ome part. In England indeed, it is reduced to a &s;hadow. Yet, without excepting even England, much of our pre&s;ent practice is evidently derived from it. This con&s;ideration mu&s;t recom|mend the feudal &s;y&s;tem, as a &s;tudy to every man of ta&s;te who is de&s;irous to acquire the true &s;pirit of law.</P>
<P>BUT the hi&s;tory of law is not con&s;ined to the feudal &s;y&s;tem. It comprehends par|ticulars without end, of which one additi|onal in&s;tance &s;hall at pre&s;ent &s;uffice. A &s;ta|tute, or any regulation, if we confine our|our&s;elves
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
to the words, is &s;eldom &s;o per&s;pi|cuous as to prevent errors, perhaps gro&s;s ones. In order to form a &s;olid judgment about any &s;tatute, and to di&s;cover its &s;pirit and intendment, we ought to be well in|formed how the law &s;tood at the time, what defect was meant to be &s;upplied, or what improvement made. The&s;e particu|lars require hi&s;torical knowledge; and there|fore, with re&s;pect to &s;tatute law at lea&s;t, &s;uch knowledge appears indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>IN the foregoing re&s;pects I have often amu&s;ed my&s;elf with a fanciful re&s;emblance of law to the river Nile. When we enter upon the municipal law of any country in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, we re&s;emble a traveller, who cro&s;&s;ing the Delta, lo&s;es his way among the numberle&s;s branches of the Egyptian river. But when we begin at the &s;ource and follow the current of law, it is in that cour&s;e not le&s;s ea&s;y than agreeable; and all its relations and dependencies are traced with no greater difficulty, than are the many
<PB N="x" REF="7">
&s;treams into which that magnificent river is divided before it is lo&s;t in the &s;ea.</P>
<P>AN author, in who&s;e voluminous writings not many things de&s;erve to be copied, has however handled the pre&s;ent &s;ubject with &s;uch &s;uperiority of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, that in order to recommend the hi&s;tory of law, I may be allowed to cite the pa&s;&s;age at large. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I might in&s;tance (&s;ays he) in o|ther profe&s;&s;ions the obligation men lie under of applying them&s;elves to certain parts of hi&s;tory, and I can hardly forbear doing it in that of the law, in its nature the noble&s;t and mo&s;t beneficial to man|kind, in its abu&s;e and deba&s;ement the mo&s;t &s;ordid and the mo&s;t pernicious. A lawyer now is nothing more, I &s;peak of ninety nine in a hundred at lea&s;t, to u&s;e &s;ome of Tully's words, <HI>ni&s;i leguleius qui|dem cautus, et acutus praeco actionum, cantor formularum, auceps &s;yllabarum.</HI> But there have been lawyers that were orators, phi|lo&s;ophers, hi&s;torians: there have been
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
Bacons and Clarendons. There will be none &s;uch any more, till in &s;ome better age, true ambition or the love of fame prevails over avarice; and till men find lei|&s;ure and encouragement to prepare them|&s;elves for the exerci&s;e of this profe&s;&s;ion, by climbing up to the <HI>vantage ground,</HI> &s;o my Lord Bacon calls it, of &s;cience, in|&s;tead of groveling all their lives below, in a mean, but gainful, application to all the little arts of chicane. Till this hap|pen, the profe&s;&s;ion of the law will &s;carce de&s;erve to be ranked among the learned profe&s;&s;ions: and whenever it happens, one of the vantage grounds to which men mu&s;t climb, is metaphy&s;ical, and the other, hi&s;torical knowledge. They mu&s;t pry into the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the human heart, and become well acquaint|ed with the whole moral world, that they may di&s;cover the ab&s;tract rea&s;on of all laws: and they mu&s;t trace the laws of particular &s;tates, e&s;pecially of their own, from the fir&s;t rough &s;ketches to the
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
more perfect draughts; from the fir&s;t cau&s;es or occa&s;ions that produced them, through all the effects, good and bad, that they produced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bolinbroke of the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, page 353. Quarto edition.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THE following di&s;cour&s;es are &s;elected from a greater number, as a &s;pecimen of that manner of treating law which is here &s;o warmly recommended. The author flatters him&s;elf, that they may tend to excite an hi&s;torical &s;pirit, if he may u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion, in tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves to law, whether for profit or amu&s;ement; and for that end &s;olely has he &s;urrendered them to the publick.</P>
<P>AN additional motive concurred to the &s;election here made. The di&s;cour&s;es relate, each of them, to &s;ubjects common to the law of England and of Scotland; and, in tracing the hi&s;tory of both, tend to intro|duce both into the reader's acquaintance.
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">
I have often reflected upon it as an unhap|py circum&s;tance, that different parts of the &s;ame kingdom &s;hould be governed by dif|ferent laws. This imperfection could not be remedied in the union betwixt England and Scotland; for what nation will tamely &s;urrender its laws more than its liberties? But if the thing was unavoidable, its bad con&s;equences were not altogether &s;o. The&s;e might have been prevented, and may yet be prevented, by e&s;tabli&s;hing publick pro|fe&s;&s;ors of both laws, and giving &s;uitable en|couragement for carrying on together the &s;tudy of both. To unite both, in &s;ome &s;uch plan of education, will be le&s;s difficult than at fir&s;t view may be apprehended; for the whole i&s;land originally was governed by the &s;ame law; and even at pre&s;ent the differ|ence con&s;i&s;ts more in terms of art than in &s;ub&s;tance. Difficulties at the &s;ame time may be overbalanced by advantages; and the propo&s;ed plan has great advantages, not only by removing or le&s;&s;ening the fore|&s;aid inconvenience, but by introducing the
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">
be&s;t method of &s;tudying law; for I know none more rational, than a careful and ju|dicious compari&s;on of the laws of different countries. Materials for &s;uch compari&s;on are richly furni&s;hed by the laws of Eng|land and of Scotland. They have &s;uch re|&s;emblance, as to bear a compari&s;on almo&s;t in every branch; and they &s;o far differ, as to illu&s;trate each other by their oppo&s;ition. Our law will admit of many improvements from that of England; and if the author be not in a mi&s;take, through partiality to his native country, we are rich enough to repay with intere&s;t, all we have occa&s;ion to borrow. A regular in&s;titute of the com|mon law of this i&s;land, deducing hi&s;torical|ly the changes which that law hath under|gone in the two nations, would be a va|luable pre&s;ent to the publick; becau&s;e it would make the &s;tudy of both laws a ta&s;k ea&s;y and agreeable. Such in&s;titute, it is true, is an undertaking too great for any one hand. But if men of knowledge and genius would undertake particular branches,
<PB N="xv" REF="12">
a general &s;y&s;tem might in time be com|pleated from their works. This &s;ubject, which has frequently occupied the author's thoughts, mu&s;t touch every Briton who wi&s;hes a compleat union; and a North-Briton in a peculiar manner. Let us re|flect but a moment upon the condition of property in Scotland, &s;ubjected in the la&s;t re&s;ort to judges, who have little inclination, becau&s;e they have &s;carce any means, to ac|quire knowledge in our law. With re&s;pect to the&s;e judges, providence, it is true, all along favourable, hath of late years been &s;ingularly kind to us. But in a matter &s;o precarious, we ought to dread a rever&s;e of fortune, which would be &s;everely felt. A pro&s;pect &s;o gloomy demands our whole ac|tivity to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the impending evil. There are men of genius in this country, and good writers. Were our law treated as a rational &s;cience, it would find its way into England, and be &s;tudied there for curio&s;ity as well as for profit. The au|thor, excited by this thought, has ventured
<PB N="xvi" REF="13">
to make an e&s;&s;ay, which, for the good of his country, more than for his own repu|tation, he wi&s;hes to &s;ucceed. If his e&s;&s;ay be reli&s;hed, he mu&s;t hope, that writers of greater abilities will be moved to undertake other branches &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till the work be brought to perfection.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE CRIMINAL LAW.</HEAD>
<P>OF the human Sy&s;tem no part, ex|ternal or internal, is more remark|able than a cla&s;s of principles in|tended obviou&s;ly to promote Society, by re&s;training men from harming each other. The&s;e principles, as the Source of the cri|minal Law, mu&s;t be attentively examined; and, to form a ju&s;t notion of them, we need but reflect upon what we feel when we com|mit a Crime, or witne&s;s it. The fir&s;t re|flection will unfold Divine ju&s;tice carried in|to
<PB N="2" REF="15">
execution with the mo&s;t penetrating wi&s;dom. Upon certain Actions, hurtful to others, the Stamp of <HI>impropriety</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> is impre&s;&s;ed in legible characters, vi&s;ible to all, not excepting even the Delinquent. Pa&s;&s;ing from the action to its Author, we feel that he is <HI>guilty;</HI> and we al&s;o feel that he ought to be puni&s;hed for his guilt. He him&s;elf, having the &s;ame feeling, is filled with remor&s;e; and, which is extremely re|markable, his remor&s;e is accompanied with an anxious dread that the puni&s;hment will be inflicted, unle&s;s it be prevented by his making reparation or atonement. Thus in the brea&s;t of man a tribunal is erected for Con&s;cience; &s;entence pa&s;&s;eth again&s;t him for every Delinquency; and he is delivered over to the hand of Providence to be pu|ni&s;hed in proportion to his guilt. With relation to a final cau&s;e, the wi&s;dom of this contrivance is con&s;picuous. A Sen&s;e of wrong is of it&s;elf not &s;ufficient to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of Pa&s;&s;ion: but the dread of Puni&s;hment, which is felt even where there
<PB N="3" REF="16">
is no vi&s;ible hand to puni&s;h, is a natural re&s;traint &s;o efficacious, that none more per|fect can be imagined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on the Principles of Morality and natural Re|ligion, Part 1. E&s;&s;. 2. Chap. 3.</NOTE>. This dread, when the re&s;ult of atrocious or unnatural Crimes, is it&s;elf a tremenduous puni&s;hment, far ex|ceeding all that have been invented by Man. Happy it is for Society, that in|&s;tances are rare of crimes &s;o gro&s;s as to produce this natural dread in its higher Degrees: it is however &s;till more rare to find any per&s;on &s;o &s;ingularly virtuous, as never to have been con&s;cious of it in any degree. When we peru&s;e the hi&s;tory of Mankind, even in their mo&s;t &s;avage State, we di&s;cover it to be univer&s;al. One in|&s;tance I mu&s;t mention, becau&s;e it relates to the Hottentotes, of all men the mo&s;t bruti&s;h. They adore a certain In&s;ect as their Deity. The arrival of this In&s;ect in a Kraal, is &s;uppo&s;ed to bring grace and pro|&s;perity to the Inhabitants; and it is an ar|ticle in their Creed, that all the offences of
<PB N="4" REF="17">
which they had been guilty to that mo|ment, are buried in oblivion, and all their iniquities pardoned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kolben's Pre&s;ent State of the Cape of Good Hope, Vol. 1. Page 99.</NOTE>. The dread which accompanies guilt, till puni&s;hment be in|flicted or forgiven, mu&s;t undoubtedly be univer&s;al, when it makes a figure even among the Hottentotes.</P>
<P>UPON every wrong, rea&s;on and expe|rience make us apprehend the re&s;entment of the per&s;on injured: but the horror of mind which accompanies every gro&s;s Crime, produceth in the Criminal an impre&s;&s;ion that all nature is in arms again&s;t him. Con&s;cious of meriting the highe&s;t puni&s;h|ment, he dreads it from the hand of GOD and from the hand of Man. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And Cain &s;aid unto the Lord, My puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear. Behold, thou ha&s;t driven me out this day from the face of the earth: and from thy face &s;hall I be hid, and I &s;hall be a fugitive
<PB N="5" REF="18">
and a vagabond in the Earth, and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that every one that findeth me, &s;hall &s;lay me<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gene&s;is Chap. iv. Ver. 13, 14.</NOTE>."</Q> Hence the efficacy of human puni&s;hments in par|ticular, to which man is adapted with wonderful fore&s;ight, through the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of their being ju&s;tly inflicted, not on|ly by the per&s;on injured, but by the Ma|gi&s;trate, or by any one. Ab&s;tracting from this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, the mo&s;t frequent in|&s;tances of cha&s;ti&s;ing Criminals, would readi|ly be mi&s;apprehended for &s;o many acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, the effects of Ma|lice even in Judges; and much more &s;o in the party offended, where the puni&s;hment is inflicted by him.</P>
<P>THE purpo&s;es of Nature are not any where left imperfect. Corre&s;ponding to the dread of puni&s;hment, is fir&s;t the indigna|tion we have at gro&s;s crimes, even when we &s;uffer not by them; and next Re&s;ent|ment in the per&s;on injured, even for the
<PB N="6" REF="19">
&s;lighte&s;t Crime; by which &s;ufficient provi|&s;ion is made for inflicting the puni&s;hment that is dreaded. No pa&s;&s;ion is more keen or fierce than Re&s;entment; which, at the &s;ame time, when confined within due bounds, is authori&s;ed by Con&s;cience. The delinquent is &s;en&s;ible that he may be ju&s;t|ly puni&s;hed; and if any per&s;on, preferably to others, be entitled to inflict the puni&s;h|ment, it mu&s;t be the per&s;on injured.</P>

<BIBL>ILIAD 9. 759.</BIBL></Q>
<P>REVENGE therefore, when provoked by Injury or voluntary wrong, is a privilege that belongs to every per&s;on by the Law of Nature; for we have no Criterion of right or wrong more illu&s;trious than the appro|bation or di&s;approbation of Con&s;cience. And thus the fir&s;t Law of Nature, regard|ing
<PB N="7" REF="20">
Society, that of ab&s;taining from in|juring others, is enforced by the mo&s;t effi|cacious Sanctions.</P>
<P>AN Author of the fir&s;t rank for Genius, as well as blood, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with great propriety upon this Subject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is another pa&s;&s;ion very different from that of fear, and which, in a certain degree, is equally pre&s;ervative to us, and con|ducing to our &s;afety. As that is &s;er|viceable in prompting us to &s;hun Dan|ger, &s;o is this in fortifying us again&s;t it, and enabling us to repel Injury and re|&s;i&s;t violence when offered. 'Tis by this Pa&s;&s;ion that one Creature offering vio|lence to another, is deterred from the execution; whil&s;t he ob&s;erves how the attempt affects his fellow, and knows by the very &s;igns which accompany this ri&s;ing motion, that if the injury be car|ried further, it will not pa&s;s ea&s;ily, or with impunity. 'Tis this pa&s;&s;ion with|al, which, after violence and ho&s;tility
<PB N="8" REF="21">
executed, rou&s;es a Creature in oppo&s;i|tion, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in returning like ho&s;tility and harm on the Invader. For thus as rage and de&s;pair encrea&s;e, a Creature grows &s;till more terrible, and, being urged to the greate&s;t extremity, finds a degree of &s;trength and boldne&s;s unexperienced till then, and which had never ri&s;en except through the height of provocation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Characteri&s;tic's, Vol. 2. Page 144.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>BUT a cur&s;ory view of this remark|able pa&s;&s;ion is not &s;ufficient. It will be &s;een by and by, that the criminal Law in all Nations, is entirely founded upon it; and for that rea&s;on it ought to be ex|amined with the utmo&s;t accuracy. Re|&s;entment is rai&s;ed in different degrees, ac|cording to the &s;en&s;e one hath of the Injury. An Injury done to a man him&s;elf, provokes Re&s;entment in its highe&s;t degree. An In|jury of the &s;ame kind done to a friend or relation, rai&s;es re&s;entment in a lower de|gree;
<PB N="9" REF="22">
and the pa&s;&s;ion becomes gradually fainter, in proportion to the &s;lightne&s;s of the connection. This difference is not the re&s;ult of any peculiarity in the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion. It is occa&s;ioned by a princi|ple inherent in all &s;en&s;ible Beings, that every one has the &s;tronge&s;t Sen&s;e of what touches it&s;elf. Thus a man hath a more lively Sen&s;e of a kindne&s;s done to him&s;elf, than to his friend; and the pa&s;&s;ion of Gratitude corre&s;ponds in degree to the Sen&s;ation. In the &s;ame manner an injury done to my&s;elf, to my child, or to my friend, makes a greater figure in my mind, than when done to others in whom I am le&s;s intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>EVERY heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of Nature, rai&s;eth Indignation in all, and a keen de&s;ire to have the Criminal brought to condign puni&s;hment. Slighter delinquencies are le&s;s regarded. A &s;light Injury done to a &s;tranger, with whom we have no connection, rai&s;eth our indigna|tion,
<PB N="10" REF="23">
it is true, but &s;o faintly as not to prompt any degree of revenge. The pa&s;|&s;ion in this ca&s;e, being quie&s;cent, vani&s;heth in a moment. But a man's re&s;entment for an injury done to him&s;elf, or to one with whom he is connected, is an active pa&s;&s;ion, which is gratified by puni&s;hing the Delin|quent in a mea&s;ure corre&s;ponding to the injury. And it mu&s;t be remarked, that many circum&s;tances mu&s;t concur before this Pa&s;&s;ion be fully gratified. It is not &s;atisfied with the &s;uffering merely of the Criminal. The Per&s;on injured mu&s;t inflict the puni&s;h|ment, or at lea&s;t direct it; and the Criminal mu&s;t be made &s;en&s;ible, not only that he is pu|ni&s;hed for his Crime, but that the puni&s;hment proceeds from the per&s;on injured. When all the&s;e circum&s;tances concur, and not otherwi&s;e, the pa&s;&s;ion is fully gratified; and commonly vani&s;heth as if it had never been. Racine under&s;tood the nature of this pa&s;&s;ion, and paints it with great ac|curacy in the following Scene.</P>

<P>THOUGH Injury, or voluntary wrong, is generally the cau&s;e of re&s;entment, we find by experience, that &s;udden pain is &s;ufficient &s;ometimes to rai&s;e this pa&s;&s;ion,

even where injury is not intended. If a man wound me by accident in a tender part, the &s;udden angui&s;h, giving no time for reflection, provokes re&s;entment, which is as &s;uddenly exerted upon the involun|tary cau&s;e. Treading upon a gouty Toe, or breaking a favourite va&s;e, may upon a warm temper produce this effect. The mind engro&s;&s;ed by bodily pain, or any pain which rai&s;es bad humour, demands an ob|ject for its re&s;entment; and what object &s;o ready as the per&s;on who was the occa&s;ion of the pain, though without de&s;ign? In the &s;ame manner, even a Stock or a Stone becomes &s;ometimes the object of re&s;ent|ment. If accidentally &s;triking my foot again&s;t a Stone, a &s;mart pain en&s;ues, Re|&s;entment di&s;covers it&s;elf at once, which prompts me to bray the Stone to pieces. The Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;till more irregular in a lo&s;ing Game&s;ter, when he vents it on the Cards and Dice. All that can be &s;aid, as an apo|logy for &s;uch ab&s;urd fits of pa&s;&s;ion, is, that they are but momentary, and vani&s;h upon

the fir&s;t reflection. And yet &s;uch indul|gence was by the Athenians given to this irrational Emotion, that if a man was killed by the fall of a Stone, or other ac|cident, the in&s;trument of death was de|de&s;troyed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meur&s;ius de leg.

Animals, it was thought, were not to be exempted from puni&s;hment more than men; and when a dome&s;tick animal did mi&s;chief contrary to its nature, the law required that it &s;hould be given up to the per&s;on who was hurt, in order to be puni&s;hed.

It is probable that originally there was a nece&s;&s;ity to deliver the animal to puni&s;hment, without ad|mitting any alternative. But afterwards, when the pa&s;&s;ions of men were more under &s;ubjection, and the connection of property became more vigorous, which la&s;t will be the &s;ub|ject of a following di&s;cour&s;e, an alternative was indulged to the defendant to repair the damage, if he cho&s;e rather to be at that expence than to &s;urrender his animal<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">l. 1. pr.

The Law of Nature &s;ubjects no man to repair the mi&s;chief done by his hor&s;e or his ox, if not antecedently known to be vitious.

<P>A tendency to exce&s;s, &s;o de&s;tructive in the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, is a quality, which in other pa&s;&s;ions is often the occa|&s;ion of good. Joy when exce&s;&s;ive as well as Gratitude, are not confined to their pro|per Objects, but expand them&s;elves upon every thing that is connected with the&s;e Objects. In general, all our active pa&s;&s;ions are, in their na&s;cent State, and when mo|derate, accompanied with a Sen&s;e of fit|ne&s;s and rectitude; but when exce&s;&s;ive, they inflame the mind, which is violent|ly hurried to action, without due di&s;tinc|tion of Objects.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="33">
AND this leads me to a reflection up|on the irregular tendency of Re&s;entment here di&s;played. If it be the nature of all active pa&s;&s;ions, when immoderate, to ex|pand them&s;elves beyond their proper ob|jects, which is remarkable in friend&s;hip, Love, Gratitude, and all the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, it ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ing that Re|&s;entment, Hatred, Envy, and other di&s;|&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hould not be more regu|lar. Among Savages this, perhaps, may have a bad tendency, by adding force to the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions: but in a civilized State, where all encouragement is given to kindly affections, and di&s;&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions are &s;oftned, if not &s;ubdued, by habitual Submi&s;&s;ion to legal Authority, this ten|dency to exce&s;s is, upon the whole, ex|tremely beneficial.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved above, that revenge is a privilege be&s;towed by the Law of Nature upon tho&s;e who &s;uffer by a voluntary in|jury; and the Corre&s;pondence hath al&s;o
<PB N="21" REF="34">
been ob&s;erved betwixt this privilege and the &s;en&s;e of merited puni&s;hment; by which means the Criminal &s;ubmits naturally to the puni&s;hment he de&s;erves. Thus by the Law of Nature, the per&s;on injured acquires a right over the delinquent, to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h him in proportion to the Injury; and the Delinquent, &s;en&s;ible of this right; knows he ought to &s;ubmit to it. Upon this account, Puni&s;hment has generally been con&s;idered as a &s;ort of debt, which the Criminal is bound to pay to the per&s;on he hath injured; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon this re&s;emblance, the expre&s;&s;ion in the Roman Language, <HI>&s;olvere,</HI> or <HI>pendere poenas,</HI> is founded.</NOTE> and this way of &s;peak|ing may &s;afely be indulged as an analogical illu&s;tration, provided no con&s;equence be drawn which the analogy will not ju&s;tify. This caution is not unnece&s;&s;ary; for many writers, influenced by the foregoing re|&s;emblance, rea&s;on about puni&s;hment unwa|rily, as if it were a debt in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. By means of the &s;ame re&s;emblance, a notion prevailed in the darker ages of the
<PB N="22" REF="35">
world, of a &s;ub&s;titute in puni&s;hment, who undertakes the debt, and &s;uffers the puni&s;h|ment that another merits. Traces of this opinion are found in the religious ceremo|nies of the ancient Egyptians and other heathen nations. Among them the con|ceptions of a Deity were gro&s;s, and of mo|rality not le&s;s &s;o. We mu&s;t not therefore be &s;urpri&s;ed at their notion of a transfe|rence of puni&s;hment, as of debt, from one per&s;on to another.

men, no maxim has a more &s;olid foundation or is more univer&s;al, than that puni&s;hment cannot be transferred from the guilty to the innocent.

Happy it is for mankind, that a compo&s;ition for &s;in is now generally exploded from our hearts, as well as actions: but, from the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of human nature, &s;uch propen&s;ity is there to this doctrine, that it continues to have an influence upon our conduct, much great|er than is willingly acknowledged, or even &s;u&s;pected.

Many men are openly charitable, to compound for private oppre&s;|&s;ion; and many men are willing to do GOD good &s;ervice, in &s;upporting his e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, to compound for aiming at power by a factious di&s;turbance of the peace of the State.

<P>HAVING di&s;cour&s;ed in general of the Nature of puni&s;hment, and of &s;ome ir|regular notions that have been entertain|ed about it, I am now ready to attend its progre&s;s through the different Stages of the &s;ocial life. Society, originally, did not make &s;o &s;trict an union among Indi|viduals as at pre&s;ent. Mutual Defence a|gain&s;t a more powerful Neighbour, being, in early times, the chief or &s;ole Motive for joining in Society, Individuals never thought of &s;urrendering to the publick, any of their natural rights that could be re|tained con&s;i&s;tently with their great aim of
<PB N="29" REF="42">
mutual Defence. In particular, the privi|leges of maintaining their own property, and of avenging their own wrongs, were re&s;erved to Individuals full and entire. In the dawn of Society, accordingly, we find no traces of a Judge, properly &s;o called, who hath power to interpo&s;e in differences, and to force per&s;ons at variance to &s;ubmit to his opinion. If a di&s;pute about property, or about any civil right, could not be ad|ju&s;ted by the parties them&s;elves, there was no other method, but to appeal to &s;ome indifferent per&s;on, who&s;e opinion &s;hould be the rule. This method of determining civil differences was imperfect; for what if the parties did not agree upon an Ar|biter? Or what if one of them proved re|fractory, after the cho&s;en Arbiter had given his opinion? To remedy the&s;e inconveni|ences, it was found expedient to e&s;tabli&s;h Judges, who, at fir&s;t, differed in one cir|cum&s;tance only from Arbiters, that they could not be declined. They had no ma|gi&s;terial authority, not even that of com|pelling
<PB N="30" REF="43">
parties to appear before them. This is evident from the Roman Law, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted many centuries before the notion obtained of a power in a Judge to force a party into Court. To bring a di&s;putable matter to an i&s;&s;ue, no other means occur|red, but the making it lawful for the Com|plainer to drag his party before the Judge, <HI>obtorto collo,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed by the writers on that Law: and the &s;ame regulation appears in the Laws of the Vi&s;igoths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 6. Tit. 4. &sect; 4.</NOTE>. But Juri&s;diction, at fir&s;t merely voluntary, came gradually to be improved to its pre&s;ent &s;tate of being compul&s;ory, involving &s;o much of the magi&s;terial Authority as is nece&s;&s;ary for explicating Juri&s;diction, <HI>viz.</HI> Power of calling a party into Court, and power of making a Sentence effectual. And in this manner, civil Juri&s;diction, in progre&s;s of time, was brought to perfection.</P>
<P>CRIMINAL Juri&s;diction is in all Coun|tries of a much later date. Revenge, the
<PB N="31" REF="44">
darling privilege of human nature, is never tamely given up; for the rea&s;on chiefly, that it is not gratified unle&s;s the puni&s;h|ment be inflicted by the per&s;on injured. The privilege of re&s;enting Injuries, was therefore that private right which was the late&s;t of being &s;urrendered, or rather wre&s;t|ed from Individuals in Society. This Revolution was of great importance with re&s;pect to Government, which can never fully attain its end, where puni&s;hment in any mea&s;ure is tru&s;ted in private hands. A Revolution &s;o contradictory to the &s;tronge&s;t propen&s;ity of human nature, could not by any power, or by any artifice, be in&s;tantaneous. It behoved to be gradual, and, in fact, the progre&s;&s;ive Steps tending to its completion, were &s;low, and, taken &s;ingly, almo&s;t imperceptible; as will appear from the following hi&s;tory. And to be convinced of the difficulty of wre&s;ting this privilege from Individuals, we need but reflect upon the practice of Duelling, &s;o cu&s;tomary in times pa&s;t; and which
<PB N="32" REF="45">
the &s;tricte&s;t attention in the Magi&s;trate, joined with the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment, have not altogether been able to repre&s;s.</P>
<P>NO production of art or nature is more imperfect than is Government in its in|fancy, comprehending no &s;ort of Juri&s;dic|tion either civil or criminal. What can more tend to break the peace of Society, and to promote univer&s;al di&s;cord, than that every man &s;hould be the &s;ole Judge in his own cau&s;e, and inflict puni&s;hment according to his own Judgment? But in|&s;tead of wondering at the original weak|ne&s;s of Government, our wonder would be better directed upon its pre&s;ent &s;tate of perfection, and upon the means by which it hath arrived to the utmo&s;t degree of Au|thority, in contradiction to the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active principles of human na|ture. This &s;ubject makes a great figure in the hi&s;tory of Mankind, and that it partly comes under the pre&s;ent undertaking, I e&s;teem a lucky circum&s;tance.</P>

A partiality that is rooted in the na|ture of Man, makes private revenge the mo&s;t dangerous privilege that ever was left with Individuals. The man who is in|jured, having a &s;trong Sen&s;e of the wrong done him, never dreams that his re&s;ent|ment can be pu&s;hed too far. The Of|fender, on the other hand, under-rating the Injury, judges a &s;light atonement to be &s;ufficient. Further, the man who &s;uffers is apt to judge ra&s;hly, and to blame per&s;ons with|out cau&s;e, where it doth not clearly appear who is the Criminal. To re&s;train the unju&s;t effects of natural partiality, was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k, and probably was not &s;oon attempted. But early mea&s;ures were taken to prevent the bad effects of ra&s;h judgment, by which the innocent were often oppre&s;&s;ed. We have one early in&s;tance among the Jews. Their cities of refuge were appointed as an interim &s;anctuary to the man-&s;layer, till the elders of the city had an opportunity to judge whether the deed was voluntary or ca&s;ual. If the latter appeared to be the
<PB N="34" REF="47">
ca&s;e, the man was protected from the rela|tions of the decea&s;ed, called in the text <HI>the avenger of blood:</HI> but he was to remain in that city until the death of the high prie&s;t, to give time for the re&s;entment of the of|fended party to &s;ub&s;ide. If the man tak|ing benefit of the &s;anctuary was found guil|ty, he was delivered to the avenger of blood that he might die<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numbers, Ch. xxxv. Deuteronomy, Ch. xix.</NOTE>. In the laws of the Athenians, and al&s;o of the barbarous na|tions who di&s;membred the Roman Empire, we find regulations which corre&s;pond to this among the Jews, and which, in a different form, prevented erroneous judgment, rather more effectually than was done by the cities of refuge. If a crime was manife&s;t, the party injured might avenge him&s;elf with|out any ceremony. Therefore it was law|ful for a man to kill his wife and the adul|terer found together<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Me|ur&s;ius de leg. Atticis, L. 1. C. 4. Laws of the Vi&s;igoths, L. 3.

IN tracing the hi&s;tory of law through dark ages unprovided with records, or &s;o &s;lenderly provided, as not to afford any re|gular hi&s;torical chain, we mu&s;t endeavour, the be&s;t way we can, to &s;upply the broken links, by hints from poets and hi&s;torians, by collateral facts, and by cautious conjec|tures drawn from the nature of the govern|ment, of the people, and of the times.

<P>EMBOLDENED by this apology, I pro|ceed chearfully with the ta&s;k I have under|taken. The nece&s;&s;ity of applying to a judge, where any doubt aro&s;e about the au|thor of the crime, was probably, in all countries, the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the legi&s;la|ture's interpo&s;ing in matters of puni&s;hment. It was no doubt a novelty; but it was &s;uch as could not readily alarm individuals, be|ing calculated not to re&s;train the privilege of revenge, but only to direct revenge to its proper object. The application to a
<PB N="38" REF="51">
judge was made nece&s;&s;ary among the Jews, by the privilege conferred upon the cities of refuge; and, among other nations, by a po&s;itive law without any circuit. That this was the law of the Vi&s;igoths and Ba|varians, hath already been &s;aid; and that it was al&s;o the law of Aby&s;&s;inia and Athens, will appear below. The &s;tep next in order, was an improvement upon the regulation above mentioned. The nece&s;&s;ity of apply|ing to a judge, removed all ambiguity about the Criminal, but it did not remove an evil, repugnant to humanity and ju&s;tice, that of putting the offender under the power of the party injured, to be puni&s;hed at his plea&s;ure. With relation to this matter, I di&s;cover a wi&s;e regulation in Aby&s;&s;inia. In that em|pire, the degree, or extent of puni&s;hment, is not left to the di&s;cretion of the per&s;on injured. The governor of the province names a judge, who determines what pu|ni&s;hment the crime de&s;erves. If death, the criminal is delivered to the accu&s;er, who has thereby an opportunity to gratify his
<PB N="39" REF="52">
re&s;entment to the full<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Father Lobo's voyage to Aby&s;&s;inia, Ch. 3.</NOTE>. This regulation mu&s;t be approved, becau&s;e it re&s;trains, in a con&s;iderable degree, that natural partiality which magnifies every injury done to a man him&s;elf, and which therefore leads to ex|ce&s;s in revenge. But a great latitude &s;till remaining in the manner of executing the puni&s;hment, this al&s;o was rectified by a law among the Athenians. A per&s;on &s;u&s;pected of murder, was fir&s;t carried before the judge, and, if found guilty, was delivered to the relations of the decea&s;ed, to be put to death, if they thought proper. But it was unlaw|ful for them to put him to any torture, or to force money from him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Meur&s;ius de leg. Atticis, L. 1. Cap. 20.</NOTE>. Whether the regulations now mentioned, were peculiar to Athens and Aby&s;&s;inia, I cannot &s;ay, for I have not di&s;covered any traces of them in the cu&s;toms of other nations. They were remedies &s;o proper for the di&s;ea&s;e, that one &s;hould imagine they mu&s;t have obtained every where, &s;ome time or other. Perhaps
<PB N="40" REF="53">
they have been prevented, and rendered un|nece&s;&s;ary, by a cu&s;tom I am now to enter upon, which made a great figure in Europe for many ages, that of pecuniary Compo|&s;itions for crimes.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e pecuniary compo&s;itions, I di&s;|cover traces among many different nations. It is natural to offer &s;atisfaction to the party injured; and no &s;atisfaction is for either party more commodious than a &s;um of money. Avarice, it is true, is not &s;o fierce a pa&s;&s;ion as re&s;entment; but it is more &s;table, and by its per&s;everance often pre|vails over the keene&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. With re|gard to man-&s;laughter in particular, which doth not always prejudice the neare&s;t rela|tions, it may appear prudent to relinqui&s;h the momentary plea&s;ure of gratifying a pa&s;&s;ion for a permanent good. At the &s;ame time, the notion that puni&s;hment is a kind of debt, did certainly facilitate the introduction of this cu&s;tom; and there was opportunity for its becoming univer&s;al, dur|ing
<PB N="41" REF="54">
the period that the right of puni&s;h|ment was in private hands. We find traces of this cu&s;tom among the ancient Greeks. The hu&s;band had a choice to put the adulterer to death, or to exact a &s;um from him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meur&s;ius de leg. Atticis, L. 1. Cap. 4.</NOTE>.

<P>THIS practice at fir&s;t, as may rea&s;onably be conjectured, re&s;ted altogether upon pri|vate con&s;ent. It was &s;o in Greece, if we can tru&s;t Eu&s;tathius in his notes upon the forgoing pa&s;&s;age in the Iliad, fir&s;t cited. He reports, that the murderer was obliged to go into bani&s;hment one year, unle&s;s he could purcha&s;e liberty to remain at home, by paying a certain fine to the relations of
<PB N="44" REF="57">
the decea&s;ed. While compo&s;itions for crimes re&s;ted upon this foundation, there was nothing new or &s;ingular in them. The per&s;on injured might puni&s;h or forgive at his plea&s;ure; and if he cho&s;e to remit the puni&s;hment upon terms or conditions, he was no doubt bound by his con&s;ent. But this practice, if not remarkable in its na|&s;cent &s;tate, made a great figure in its after progre&s;s. It was not only countenanced, but greatly encouraged among all nations, as the likelye&s;t means to re&s;train the impe|tuo&s;ity of revenge, till becoming frequent and cu&s;tomary, it was e&s;tabli&s;hed into a law; and what at fir&s;t was voluntary, was, in proce&s;s of time, made nece&s;&s;ary. But this change was &s;low and gradual. The fir&s;t &s;tep probably was to interpo&s;e in be|half of the delinquent, if he offered a rea&s;on|able &s;atisfaction in cattle or money; and to afford him protection, if the &s;atisfaction was refu&s;ed by the per&s;on injured. The next &s;tep was to make it unlawful to pro&s;e|cute re&s;entment, without fir&s;t demanding
<PB N="45" REF="58">
&s;atisfaction from the delinquent. And in the Laws of king Ina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lambards Collection, Law 9.</NOTE> we read, that he who takes revenge without fir&s;t demand|ing &s;atisfaction, mu&s;t re&s;tore what he has taken, and further be liable in a compen&s;a|tion. The third &s;tep compleated the &s;y&s;tem, which was to compel the delinquent to pay, and the per&s;on injured to accept of a proper &s;atisfaction. By the laws of the Longo|bards<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 1.

<P>THE &s;ame notion prevailed among Chri|&s;tians, and altars &s;erved the purpo&s;e of the cities of refuge among the Jews. Thus, by the Law of the Vi&s;igoths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 6.

Had the pro&s;ecuter, at this period, been bound to accept of a compo&s;ition, the pri|vilege of &s;anctuary would have been unne|ce&s;&s;ary. By this time however, it would appear, the practice of compounding for crimes had gained &s;uch authority, that it was thought hard, even for a murderer, to lo&s;e his life, by the ob&s;tinacy of the dead
<PB N="48" REF="61">
man's relations. But this practice gaining &s;till more authority, it was enacted in Eng|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laws of King Ina collected by Lambard. Law 5.</NOTE>, That if any guilty of a capital crime, fly to the church, his life &s;hall be &s;afe, but he mu&s;t pay a compo&s;ition. Thus it ap|pears, that the privilege of &s;anctuary, tho' the child of &s;uper&s;tition, was extremely u&s;e|ful, while the power of puni&s;hment was a private right: but now that this right is transferred to the publick, and that there is no longer any hazard of exce&s;s in puni&s;h|ment, a &s;anctuary for crimes, which hath no other effect but to re&s;train the free cour&s;e of the criminal law, and to give unju&s;t hopes of impunity, ought not to be tolerated in any &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WHEN compo&s;itions fir&s;t came in u&s;e, it is probable that they were authorized in &s;light delinquencies only. We read in the laws of the Vi&s;igoths<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 6. Tit. 4. &sect; 1.</NOTE>, That if a free man &s;trike another free man on the head, he

The laws of the Burgundians, of the Salians, of the Almanni, of the Bavarians, of the Ri|puarii, of the Saxons, of the Angli and Thu|ringi, of the Fri&s;ians, of the Longobards, and of the Anglo Saxons, are full of the&s;e compo|&s;itions, extending from the mo&s;t triffling inju|ry, to the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, not except|ing high trea&s;on, by imagining and compa&s;s|ing the death of the King.

&s;crupulous nicety of adju&s;ting &s;ums to de|linquencies? Such a thing is not heard of in later times.

This quarrel was pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch malice and violence, that the counties of Waterford and Kilkenny were de&s;troyed with fire and &s;word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Affairs of Ireland by Sir John Davies.</NOTE>.</NOTE>. There|fore, to provide for its gratification, it be|came nece&s;&s;ary to enact compo&s;itions for every triffling wrong, &s;uch as at pre&s;ent would be the &s;ubject of mirth rather than of &s;erious puni&s;hment. For example, where the clothes of a woman, bathing in a river, are taken away to expo&s;e her nakedne&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Laws of the Longobards, L. 1.

<PB N="51" REF="64">
re&s;entment being in a good mea&s;ure &s;unk in publick puni&s;hment, nothing is reckoned criminal, but what encroaches upon the &s;afety or peace of &s;ociety; and &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment is cho&s;en, as may have the effect of repre&s;&s;ing the crime in time coming, with|out much regarding the gratification of the party offended.</P>
<P>As the&s;e compo&s;itions were favoured by the re&s;emblance that private puni&s;hment has to a debt, they were apt, in a gro&s;s way of thinking, to be con&s;idered as repa|ration to the party injured for his lo&s;s or damage.

Ari&s;totle talks familiarly of an involuntary crime; and that this was not merely a way of &s;peaking, ap|pears from the &s;tory of Oedipus, who&s;e crimes, if they can be called &s;o, were, &s;trictly &s;peaking, involuntary. And by an expre&s;s law among the Athenians, involuntary &s;laughter was puni&s;hed with bani&s;hment, without liberty of returning till the relations of the decea&s;ed were &s;atisfied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meur&s;ius de leg. Atticis, L. 1. Cap. 16.</NOTE>.</NOTE>. But &s;uch was the prevalency of Re&s;entment, that though at fir&s;t no allevi|ation or excu&s;e was &s;u&s;tained to mitigate the compo&s;ition, aggravating circum&s;tances were often laid hold of to inflame the com|po&s;ition. Thus he who took the oppor|tunity

of fire or &s;hipwreck, to &s;teal goods, was obliged to re&s;tore four fold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laws of the Vi&s;igoths, L. 7. Tit. 2. &sect; 18.</NOTE>. The&s;e compo&s;itions were al&s;o proportioned to the dignity of the per&s;ons injured; and from this &s;ource is derived our knowledge of the different ranks and titles of honour among the barbarous nations above mentioned. And it is a &s;trong indication of the ap|proach of the&s;e nations towards humanity and politene&s;s, that their compo&s;itions for injuries done to women are generally double.</P>
<P>AS to the per&s;ons who were entitled to the compo&s;ition, it mu&s;t be obvious in the fir&s;t place, that he only had right to the compo&s;ition who was injured: but if a man was killed, every one of his relations was entitled to a &s;hare, becau&s;e they were all &s;ufferers by his death. Thus, in the Salic laws<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 65.</NOTE>, where a man is killed, the half of the compo&s;ition belongs to his children; the other half to his other relations, upon the &s;ide of the father and mother. If there

be no relations on the father's &s;ide, the part that would belong to them, accrues to the &s;i&s;k. The like if there be no relations on the mother's &s;ide. The Longobards had a &s;ingular way of thinking in this matter. Female relations got no part of the com|po&s;ition; and the rea&s;on given is, that they cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t in pro&s;ecuting revenge, <HI>non po&s;|&s;unt ip&s;am faydam levare</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 1.

<P>BEFORE entering upon a new branch, I mu&s;t lay hold of the pre&s;ent opportuni|ty, to be&s;tow a reflection upon this &s;ingu|lar practice of compounding for crimes. However &s;trange it may appear to us, it was certainly a happy invention. By the temp|tation of money, men were gradually ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;tiffle their re&s;entments. This was a fine preparation for transferring the
<PB N="55" REF="68">
power of puni&s;hment to the magi&s;trate, which would have been impracticable with|out &s;ome &s;uch intermediate &s;tep: for while individuals retain their privilege of aveng|ing injuries, the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, for|tified by univer&s;al practice, is too violent to be &s;ubdued by the force of any government.</P>
<P>WE are now arrived at the la&s;t and mo&s;t &s;hining period of the Criminal Law. And our pre&s;ent ta&s;k is to unfold the means by which criminal juri&s;diction, or the right of puni&s;hment, was transferred from private hands to the magi&s;trate. There, perhaps, never was in government a revolution of greater importance than this. While cri|minal juri&s;diction is ingro&s;&s;ed by every in|dividual for his own behoof, there mu&s;t be an overbalance of power in the people, in|con&s;i&s;tent with any &s;table admini&s;tration of publick affairs. The daily practice of blood, makes a nation fierce and untameable, &s;o as not to be awed by the power of any go|vernment. A government, at the &s;ame
<PB N="56" REF="69">
time, de&s;titute of the power of the &s;word, except in crimes again&s;t the publick, which are rare, mu&s;t be &s;o weak, as &s;carce to be a match for the tame&s;t people: for it can|not e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, that nothing tends more to &s;upport the authority of the ma|gi&s;trate, than his power of criminal juri&s;|diction; becau&s;e every exerci&s;e of that power, being publick, &s;trikes every eye. In a coun|try already civilized, the power of making laws may be con&s;idered as a greater tru&s;t: but in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of government, and to create awe and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion in the people, the power of making laws is a mere &s;hadow, without the power of the &s;word.</P>
<P>IN the original formation of &s;ocieties, to which mutual defence again&s;t &s;ome more powerful enemy was the chief or &s;ole mo|tive, the idea of a common intere&s;t, other|wi&s;e than for defence, of a publick, of a com|munity, was &s;carce under&s;tood. War, in|deed, requiring the &s;tricte&s;t union among
<PB N="57" REF="70">
individuals, introduced the notion of a number of men becoming an army, governed like a &s;ingle per&s;on, by one mind, and one council. But in peaceable times, every man relied upon his own prowe&s;s, or that of his clan, without having any notion of a com|mon intere&s;t, of which no &s;igns appeared. There behoved indeed, from the beginning, to be &s;ome &s;ort of government; but it was &s;o limited, that the magi&s;trate did not pre|tend to interpo&s;e in private differences, whe|ther civil or criminal. In the infancy of &s;ociety, the idea of a publick is &s;o faint and ob&s;cure, that publick crimes, where no in|dividual is hurt, pa&s;s unregarded. But when government, in its natural growth, hath advanced to &s;ome degree of maturi|ty, the publick intere&s;t is then recognized, and the nature of a crime again&s;t the pu|blick under&s;tood. This notion mu&s;t gain &s;trength, and become univer&s;al, in the cour&s;e of a regular admini&s;tration, &s;preading it|&s;elf upon all affairs which have any con|nection with the common intere&s;t. It na|turally
<PB N="58" REF="71">
comes to be con&s;idered, that by all atrocious crimes the publick is injured, and by open rapine and violence the peace of the &s;ociety broke. This introduced a new re|gulation, that in compounding for gro&s;s crimes, a fine, or <HI>fredum,</HI> &s;hould be paid to the fi&s;k, over and above what the per&s;on injured was entitled to claim.</P>
<P>IT cannot be doubted, that the compo|&s;itions for crimes e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, paved the way to the&s;e improved notions of go|vernment. Compo&s;itions were fir&s;t &s;oli|cited, and afterwards enforced by the legi&s;|lative authority. It was now no longer a novelty for the chief magi&s;trate to inter|po&s;e in private quarrels. Re&s;entment was now no longer allowed to rage, but was brought under &s;ome di&s;cipline: and this re|formation, at the &s;ame time, however bur|den&s;ome to an individual during a fit of pa&s;&s;ion, was agreeable to all in their ordi|nary &s;tate of mind. The magi&s;trate, hav|ing thus acquired &s;uch influence even in pri|vate
<PB N="59" REF="72">
puni&s;hment, proceeded naturally to a&s;|&s;ume the privilege of avenging wrongs done to the publick merely, where no individual is hurt. And in this manner was the power of puni&s;hing crimes again&s;t the &s;tate, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the chief magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>TO publick crimes, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, where no individual is hurt, was at fir&s;t this new-a&s;&s;umed privilege undoubtedly con|fined. And accordingly, in the laws of the Bavarians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. 6. &sect; 1.</NOTE>, we find that the goods of tho&s;e who contract marriage within the prohi|bited degrees, are confi&s;cated. In the laws of King Ina<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lambard's Collection, Law 6.</NOTE>, he who fights in the King's hou&s;e, forfeits all his &s;ub&s;tance, and his life is to be in the King's power. The judge, who knowingly doth inju&s;tice, &s;hall lo&s;e his liberty, unle&s;s the King admit him to re|deem the &s;ame<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Laws of William the Conqueror, Wilkin's Edition, Law 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, that there is a publick, that this publick is a politic body,
<PB N="60" REF="73">
which, like a real per&s;on, may &s;ue and de|fend, and in particular is entitled to re&s;ent injuries; it was an ea&s;y &s;tep, as hinted above, to intere&s;t the publick even in private crimes, by imagining every atrocious crime to be a publick as well as a private injury; and in par|ticular, that by every open act of violence, the peace of the publick or country is broke. In the olde&s;t compo&s;itions for crimes that are recorded, there is not a word of the publick; the whole is given to the private party. In the Salic laws, there is a very long li&s;t of crimes, and of their conver&s;ion in money, without any fine to the publick. The &s;ame in the laws of the Allamanni. But in the tables of compo&s;itions for crimes among the Burgundians and Longobards, &s;uppo&s;ed to be more recent, there is con|&s;tantly &s;uperadded a fine, or <HI>fredum,</HI> to the King. And in the laws of King Canute<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lambard's Collection, Law 2.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If murder be committed in a church, a full compen&s;ation &s;hall be paid to JESUS CHRIST, another full compen&s;ation to
<PB N="61" REF="74">
the King, and a third to the relations of the decea&s;ed."</Q> The two fir&s;t com|po&s;itions, are evidently founded upon the foregoing &s;uppo&s;ition, that the peace of the church, and the King's peace, are broke by the murder.</P>
<P>AFTER e&s;tabli&s;hing compo&s;itions for crimes, which proved a very lucky exertion of legal authority, the publick had not hitherto claimed any privilege but what be|longed to every private per&s;on, <HI>viz.</HI> that of pro&s;ecuting its own re&s;entment. But this practice of converting puni&s;hment into money, a wi&s;e in&s;titution indeed to prevent a greater evil, was yet, in it&s;elf, too ab&s;urd to be for ever &s;upported again&s;t enlightned rea&s;on. Certain crimes came to be reckoned too flagrant and atrocious to admit of a pe|cuniary conver&s;ion: and, perhaps, the low|ne&s;s of the conver&s;ion contributed to this thought; for compo&s;itions e&s;tabli&s;hed in days of poverty, bore no proportion to crimes after nations became rich and power|ful.
<PB N="62" REF="75">
That this was the ca&s;e of the old Ro|man compo&s;itions, every one knows who has dip'd into their hi&s;tory. This evil re|quired a remedy, and it was not difficult to find one. It had long been e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the per&s;on injured has no claim but for the compo&s;ition, however di&s;proportioned to the crime. Here then was a fair oppor|tunity for the King, or chief magi&s;trate, to interpo&s;e, and to decree an adequate puni&s;h|ment. The fir&s;t in&s;tances of this kind had probably the con&s;ent of the per&s;on injured; and it is not difficult to per&s;uade any man of &s;pirit, that it is more for his honour, to &s;ee his enemy condignly puni&s;hed, than to put up with a triffling compen&s;ation in money. However this be, the new method of pu|ni&s;hing atrocious crimes gained credit, be|came cu&s;tomary, and pa&s;t into a law. If a puni&s;hment was inflicted adequate to the crime, there could be no claim for a com|po&s;ition, which would be the &s;ame as paying a debt twice. And thus, though indirectly, an end was put to the right of
<PB N="63" REF="76">
private puni&s;hment in all matters of im|portance.</P>
<P>THEFT is a crime, which, more than any other private crime, affected the publick, after the &s;ecurity of property came to be a capital object; and therefore theft afforded probably the fir&s;t in&s;tances of this new kind of puni&s;hment. It was enacted in England, That a thief, after repeated acts, &s;hall have his hand or foot cut off<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laws of King Ina, Lambard's Collection, Law 18.</NOTE>. Among the Longobards, the third act of theft was pu|ni&s;hed with death<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 1. Tit. 25. &sect; 67.</NOTE>. By the Salic laws, theft was puni&s;hed with death, if proved by &s;even or five credible witne&s;&s;es<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 70. &sect; 7.</NOTE>. And that the fir&s;t in&s;tances of this new puni&s;hment had the con&s;ent of the per&s;on injured, is made probable from the &s;ame Salic laws, in which murder was puni&s;hed with death, and no compo&s;ition admitted, without con|&s;ent of the friends of the decea&s;ed<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 70. &sect; 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="77">
A power to puni&s;h all atrocious crimes, though of a private nature, was a valuable acqui&s;ition to the publick. This acqui|&s;ition was &s;upported by the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, which, as ob&s;erved in the be|ginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, entitles even tho&s;e to inflict puni&s;hment who are not injured by the crime; and if &s;uch privilege belong to private per&s;ons, there could be no doubt that the magi&s;trate was peculiarly privi|leged. Here, by the way, may be remarked, a &s;triking in&s;tance of the aptitude of man for &s;ociety. By engro&s;&s;ing the right of puni&s;hing, Government has reached a high degree towards perfection. But did nature dictate that none have right to puni&s;h but tho&s;e who are injured, government mu&s;t for ever have remained in its infantine &s;tate: for, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, I can di&s;cover no means &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue human nature, and to contradict it &s;o far, as to confine to the magi&s;trate the power of di&s;pen&s;ing pu|ni&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="78">
THE magi&s;trates power of criminal ju|ri&s;diction being thus far advanced, was car|ried its full length without meeting any longer with the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;truction. Com|po&s;itions for crimes were prohibited, or wore out of practice; and the people were taught a &s;alutary doctrine, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with good government to &s;uffer individuals to exert their re&s;entment, otherwi&s;e than by applying to the criminal judge, who, after trying the crime, directs an adequate puni&s;hment to be inflicted by an officer ap|pointed for that purpo&s;e; admitting no o|ther gratification to the per&s;on injured, but to &s;ee the &s;entence put in execution, if he be plea&s;ed to indulge his re&s;entment &s;o far.</P>
<P>BUT as this &s;ignal revolution in the cri|minal law behoved to be galling to indi|viduals, unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;train their pa&s;|&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For &s;ome time after this revolution was compleated, we find, among mo&s;t European nations, certain crimes prevail|ing, one after another, in a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Two centu|ries ago, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was the crime in fa&s;hion. It wore out by degrees, and made way for a more covered, but more dete&s;table method of de&s;truction, and that is poi&s;on. This horrid crime was extremely common, in France and Italy chiefly, almo&s;t within a century. It vani&s;hed imperceptibly, and was &s;uc|ceeded by a le&s;s di&s;honourable method of exerci&s;ing revenge, <HI>viz.</HI> duelling. This curious &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is too regular to have been the child of accident. It mu&s;t have had a regular caufe; and this cau&s;e, I imagine, may be gathered from the hi&s;tory now given of the criminal law. We may readily believe, that the right of puni&s;hment, wre&s;ted from individuals, and tran&s;|ferred to the magi&s;trate, was at fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to with the ut|mo&s;t reluctance. Re&s;entment is a pa&s;&s;ion too fierce to be &s;ub|dued till man be fir&s;t humanized and &s;oftened in a long cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, under the awe and dread of a government firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. For many centuries after the power of the &s;word was a&s;&s;umed by the magi&s;trate, individuals, prone to avenge their own wrongs, were ince&s;&s;antly breaking out into open violence, murder not excepted. But the authority of law, gathering &s;trength daily, became too mighty for revenge exe|cuted in this bold manner; and open violence, through the terror of puni&s;hment, being repre&s;&s;ed, confined men to more cautious methods, and introduced a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination in place of murder committed openly. But as a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination is &s;eldom practicable without accomplices or emi&s;&s;aries, of abandoned morals, experience &s;hewed that this crime is never long con|cealed; and the fear of detection prevailed at la&s;t over the &s;pirit of revenge gratified in this hazardous manner. More &s;ecret methods of gratification were now &s;tudied. A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion repre&s;&s;ed made way for poi&s;oning, the mo&s;t dangerous pe&s;t that ever invaded &s;ociety, if, as believed, poi&s;on can be conveyed in a letter, or by other-latent means that cannot be traced. Here legal authority was at a &s;tand; for how can a criminal be reached who is unknown? But nature happily interpo&s;ed, and afforded a remedy when law could not. The gratification which poi&s;oning affords, mu&s;t be extremely &s;light, when the offender is not made &s;en&s;ible from what quarter the puni&s;hment comes, nor for what cau&s;e it is in|flicted. Repeated experience &s;howed the emptine&s;s of this method of avenging injuries; a method which plunges a man in guilt, without procuring him any gratification. This hor|rid practice, accordingly, had not a long cour&s;e. Con|&s;cience and humanity exerted their lawful authority, and put an end to it. Such, in many in&s;tances, is the cour&s;e of pro|vidence. It exerts benevolent wi&s;dom in &s;uch a manner as to bring good out of evil. The crime of poi&s;oning is &s;carce within the reach of the magi&s;trate: but a remedy is provided in the very nature of its cau&s;e; for, as ob&s;erved, revenge is never gratified, unle&s;s it be made known to the offender that he is puni&s;hed by the per&s;on injured. To fini&s;h my reflecti|ons upon this &s;ubject, duelling, which came in the la&s;t place, was &s;upported by a notion of honour; and the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting propen&s;ity to revenge blinded men &s;o much, as to make them &s;ee but ob&s;curely, that the practice is incon&s;i&s;tent with con|&s;cience and humanity.</NOTE>, all mea&s;ures were taken to make
<PB N="66" REF="79">
the yoke ea&s;y, by directing &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment as tended the mo&s;t to gratify the per|&s;on injured. Whether this was done in a political view, or through the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing influence of the right of private revenge, is not material. But the fact is curious, and merits attention; becau&s;e it unfolds
<PB N="67" REF="80">
the rea&s;on of that variation of puni&s;hment for the &s;ame crime, which is remarkable in different ages. With re&s;pect to theft, the
<PB N="68" REF="81">
puni&s;hment among the Bavarians was in|crea&s;ed to a nine-fold re&s;titution, calculated entirely to &s;atisfy the per&s;on injured, before they thought of a corporal puni&s;hment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. 8. &sect; 1.</NOTE>. The next &s;tep was demembration, by cut|ting off the hand or foot; but this only af|ter repeated acts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Laws of King Ina, Lambard, L. 18.</NOTE>. Among the Longo|bards, it required a third act of theft, be|fore a capital puni&s;hment could be in|flicted<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 1. Tit. 25. &sect; 67.</NOTE>. And at la&s;t theft was to be pu|ni&s;hed with death in all ca&s;es, if clearly proved<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Salic Laws, Tit. 70. &sect; 7.</NOTE>. By this time, it would appear, the intere&s;t of the publick, with re&s;pect to puni&s;hment, had prevailed over private in|tere&s;t; or at lea&s;t had become weighty enough to direct a puni&s;hment that &s;hould an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of terror, as well as of private re&s;entment. There is one curious fact relating to the puni&s;hment of theft, which I mu&s;t not overlook. By the laws of the Twelve Tables, borrowed from Greece, theft was puni&s;hed with death in a
<PB N="69" REF="82">
&s;lave, and with &s;lavery in a free man. But this law, being not agreeable either to the manners or notions of the Roman people, was afterwards mitigated, by converting the puni&s;hment into a pecuniary compo&s;i|tion; &s;ubjecting the <HI>furtum manife&s;tum</HI> to a four-fold re&s;titution, and the <HI>furtum nec ma|nife&s;tum,</HI> to the re&s;titution of double. The puni&s;hment of theft, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of the Twelve Tables, might &s;uit &s;ome of the civilized &s;tates in Greece, who had ac|quired the notion of a publick, and of the intere&s;t which a publick has to puni&s;h crimes <HI>in terrorem.</HI> But the law was un&s;uitable to the notions of a rude people, &s;uch as the Ro|mans were in tho&s;e days, who of puni&s;h|ment under&s;tood no other end but the gra|tification of private re&s;entment. Nor do I find in any period of the Roman hi&s;tory, that theft was con&s;idered as a crime again&s;t the publick, to admit of a puni&s;hment <HI>in terrorem.</HI> Towards &s;uch improvement there never was a &s;tep taken but one, which was not only late, but extremely &s;light, <HI>viz.</HI> that
<PB N="70" REF="83">
a thief might be condemned to an arbitrary puni&s;hment, if the party injured cho&s;e to in&s;i&s;t for it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. ult. de Furtis.</NOTE>. I make another remark, that &s;o long as the gratification of the pro|&s;ecutor was the principal aim in puni&s;hing theft, the value of the &s;tolen goods was con&s;tantly con&s;idered as a preferable claim<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judicia Civitatis Lundoniae, Wil|kins, p. 65.</NOTE>. for unle&s;s the pro&s;ecutor obtain re&s;titution of his goods or their value, there can be no &s;ufficient gratification. But after the intere&s;t of the publick came chiefly to be con&s;idered in puni&s;hing theft, the pro&s;ecu|tor's claim of re&s;titution was little regarded, of which our act 26. p. 1661. is clear evi|dence; witne&s;s al&s;o the law of Saxony, by which if a thief &s;uffer death, his heir is not bound to re&s;tore the &s;tolen goods<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Carpzovius, part 4. con&s;t. 32. def. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on, a fal&s;e witne&s;s is now puni&s;hed capitally in Scotland, though not &s;o of old. By the Roman Law<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">l. 1. &sect; ult. de leg. Cornel. de fals.</NOTE>, and

UPON this head, a remark occurs which will be found to hold univer&s;ally. It re|gards a material point, that of adju&s;ting puni&s;hments to crimes, when criminal juri&s;|diction is totally ingro&s;&s;ed by the publick. After this revolution in government, we find the fir&s;t puni&s;hments extremely mode|rate; not only for the rea&s;on above given, that they are directed chiefly to gratify the per&s;ons injured, but for a &s;eparate rea&s;on. Though the power of the &s;word adds great authority to a government, yet this effect is far from being in&s;tantaneous; and till authority be &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed, great &s;everities are beyond the &s;trength of a legi&s;|lature. But after publick authority is firm|ly rooted in the minds of the people, pu|ni&s;hments more rigorous may be ventured upon, which are rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the yet indi&s;ciplined temper of the people. At la&s;t, when a people have become altogether tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, under a long and &s;teady admini&s;tration, puni&s;hments being

le&s;s and le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, are generally mild, and ought always to be &s;o<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WE di&s;cover a &s;imilar progre&s;s in the civil law of this country. Some ages ago, before the ferocity of the inhabi|tants of this part of the i&s;land was &s;ubdued, the utmo&s;t &s;e|verity of the civil law was nece&s;&s;ary, to re&s;train individuals from plundering each other. Thus the man who intermed|led irregularly with the moveables of a per&s;on decea&s;ed, was &s;ubjected to all the debts of the decea&s;ed without limi|tation. This makes a branch of the law of Scoland, known by the name of <HI>Vitious Intromi&s;&s;ion;</HI> and &s;o rigidly was this regulation applied in our courts of law, that the mo&s;t triffl|ing moveable ab&s;tracted <HI>mala fide,</HI> &s;ubjected the intermedler to the forgoing con&s;equences, which proved, in many in&s;tan|ces, a mo&s;t rigorous puni&s;hment. But this &s;everity was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;ubdue the undi&s;ciplined nature of our people. It is extremely remarkable, that in proportion to to our improvement in manners, this regulation has been gradually &s;oftned, and applied by our &s;overeign court with a &s;paring hand. It is at pre&s;ent &s;o little in repute, that the vitious intromi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be extremely gro&s;s which provokes the judges to give way to the law in its utmo&s;t extent; and it &s;eldom happens, that vitious intromi&s;&s;ion is attended with any con&s;equence beyond reparation, and co&s;ts of &s;uit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER remark occurs, connected with the former, that to pre&s;erve a &s;trict proporti|on betwixt a crime and its puni&s;hment, is not the only or chief view of a wi&s;e legi&s;lature. The purpo&s;es of human puni&s;hments are, fir&s;t, to add weight to tho&s;e which nature has
<PB N="74" REF="87">
provided, and next to enforce municipal regulations intended for the good of &s;ocie|ty. In this view, a crime, however heinous, ought to be little regarded, if it have no bad effect in &s;ociety. On the other hand, a crime, however &s;light, ought to be &s;everely puni&s;hed, if it tend greatly to di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety. A di&s;pute about the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to a crown, &s;eldom ends without a civil war, in which the party vanqui&s;hed, however zealous for right, and for the good of their country, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as guil|ty of trea&s;on again&s;t their lawful &s;overeign; and to prevent the ruine of civil war, it be|comes nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch trea&s;on be at|tended with the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment, with|out regarding, that the guilt of tho&s;e who &s;uffer aro&s;e from bad &s;ucce&s;s merely. Hence, in regulating the puni&s;hment of crimes, two circum&s;tances ought to weigh, <HI>viz.</HI> the immorality of the action, and its bad tendency, of which the latter appears to be the capital circum&s;tance; for this evi|dent rea&s;on, that the peace of &s;ociety is an
<PB N="75" REF="88">
object of much greater importance, than the peace, or even life, of many individuals.</P>
<P>ONE great advantage, among many, of transferring to the magi&s;trate the power of puni&s;hment, is, that revenge thereby is kept within the &s;tricte&s;t bounds, and confined to its proper objects. The criminal law ap|pears to have been brought to perfection among the antient Egyptians. It was a re|gulation among them, that a woman with child could not be put to death till &s;he was delivered. And our author Diodorus Si|culus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 1. Ch. 6.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, That this law was received by many of the Grecian &s;tates, deeming it unju&s;t, that the innocent &s;hould &s;uffer with the guilty; and that a child, common to father and mother, &s;hould lo&s;e its life for the crime of the mother. The power of puni&s;hment mu&s;t have long been the privi|vilege of the magi&s;trate, before a law &s;o moderate and &s;o impartial could take place. We find no &s;imilar in&s;tances while puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="76" REF="89">
was in the hands of individuals; for a good rea&s;on, that &s;uch regulations are in|compatible with the partiality of man, and the inflamable nature of re&s;entment. But this is not the only in&s;tance of the wi&s;dom and moderation of the criminal law now mentioned. Capital puni&s;hments are avoid|ed as much as po&s;&s;ible; and in their place puni&s;hments are cho&s;en, which, equally with death, re&s;train the delinquent from com|mitting the like crime a &s;econd time. In a word, the antient Egyptian puni&s;hments have the following peculiar character, that they effectually an&s;wer their end, with le&s;s har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, than is found in the laws of any other nation antient or modern. Thus tho&s;e who revealed the &s;ecrets of the army to the enemy, had their tongues cut out. Tho&s;e who coined fal&s;e money, or contrived fal&s;e weights, or forged deeds, or razed publick records, were condemned to lo&s;e both hands. In like manner, he that committed a rape upon a free woman, was deprived of his privy members; and a wo|man
<PB N="77" REF="90">
committing adultery, was puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of her no&s;e, that &s;he might not again allure men to wantonne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>WE have an in&s;tance in this law of &s;till greater refine|ment. The criminal law of other civilized nations has not, in any in&s;tance, a farther aim than to prevent injury and mi&s;|chief. Egypt is the only country we read of, where indi|viduals were laid under an obligation to aid the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, under a penal &s;anction. In the table of laws recorded by the above mentioned author, we read the following pa&s;&s;age. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If a man be violently a&s;&s;aulted, and in hazard of death, it is the duty of every by-&s;tander to attempt a re&s;cue; and if it be proved again&s;t &s;uch a man, that he was &s;ufficiently able to prevent the murder, his neglect or forbearance is to be puni&s;hed with death."</Q> It is altogether concordant with the refined &s;pirit of the other laws mentioned by our author, that relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;hould be made the duty of every individual: but to puni&s;h with death an act of omi&s;&s;ion, or a neglect of any duty, far more the neglect of a duty &s;o refined, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the mo&s;t exalted notions of morality. Government mu&s;t have arrived at great perfec|tion, before &s;uch a regulation could be admitted. None of the pre&s;ent European nations are even at pre&s;ent &s;o far re|fined as to admit of &s;uch a law. There mu&s;t be &s;ome cau&s;e, natural or artificial, for &s;uch early per&s;ection of the crimi|nal law in Egypt; and as the &s;ubject is of importance, in tracing the hi&s;tory of mankind, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;ent opportunity of attempting to inve&s;tigate this cau&s;e.</P>
<P>HUNTING and fi&s;hing, in order for &s;u&s;tenance, were the original occupations of man. The &s;hepherd life &s;ucceeded; and the next &s;tage was that of agriculture. The&s;e progre&s;&s;ive changes, in the order now mentioned, may be traced in all nations, &s;o far as we have any remains of their original hi|&s;tory. The life of a fi&s;her or hunter is aver&s;e to &s;ociety, except among the members of &s;ingle families. The &s;hepherd life promotes larger &s;ocieties, if that can be called a &s;ociety, which hath &s;carce any other than a local connection. But the true &s;pirit of &s;ociety, which con&s;i&s;ts in mutual benefits, and in making the indu&s;try of individuals profitable to others as well as to them&s;elves, was not known till agriculture was invented. Agriculture requires the aid of many other arts. The carpenter, the black&s;mith, the ma&s;on, and other artifi|cers, contribute to it. This circum&s;tance connects indi|viduals in an intimate &s;ociety of mutual &s;upport, which again compacts them within a narrow &s;pace. Now, in the fir&s;t &s;tate of man, <HI>viz.</HI> that of hunting and fi&s;hing, there obvi|ou&s;ly is no place for government, except that which is exer|ci&s;ed by the heads of families over children and dome&s;ticks. The &s;hepherd life, in which &s;ocieties are formed, by the con|junction of families for mutual defence, requires &s;ome &s;ort of government; &s;light indeed in proportion to the &s;lightne&s;s of the mutual connection. But it was agriculture which fir&s;t produced a regular &s;y&s;tem of government. The intimate union among a multitude of individuals, occa&s;ioned by agri|culture, di&s;covered a number of &s;ocial duties, formerly un|known. The&s;e behoved to be a&s;certained by laws, the ob|&s;ervance of which mu&s;t be enforced by puni&s;hment. Such operations cannot be carried on, otherwi&s;e than by lodging power in one or more per&s;ons, to direct the re&s;olutions, and apply the force of the whole &s;ociety. In &s;hort, it may be laid down as an univer&s;al maxim, that in every &s;ociety, the advances of government towards perfection, are &s;trictly pro|portioned to the advances of the &s;ociety towards intimacy of union.</P>
<P>WHEN we apply the&s;e reflections to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, we find that the condition of the land of Egypt makes hu&s;|bandry of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; becau&s;e in that country, with|out hu&s;bandry, there are no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. All the &s;oil, except what is yearly covered with the river when it overflows, being a barren &s;and unfit for habitation, the peo|ple are confined to the low grounds adjacent to the river. The fandy grounds produce little or no gra&s;s; and however fit for pa&s;ture the low grounds may be during the bulk of the year, the inhabitants, without agriculture, would be de&s;ti|tute of all means to pre&s;erve their cattle alive during the inundation. The Egyptians mu&s;t therefore, from the begin|ning, have depended upon hu&s;bandry for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the &s;oil, by the yearly inundations, being rendered ex|tremely fertile, the great plenty of provi&s;ions produced by the &s;lighte&s;t culture, could not fail to multiply the people exceedingly. But this people lived in a &s;till more compact &s;tate, than is nece&s;&s;ary for the pro&s;ecution of hu&s;bandry in other countries; becau&s;e their cultivated lands were narrow in proportion to their fertility. Individuals, thus collected within very narrow bounds, could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment without a regular government. The nece&s;&s;ity, after every inundation, of adju&s;ting marches by geometry, naturally pro|ductive of di&s;putes, mu&s;t alone have early taught the inhabi|tants of this wonderful country, the nece&s;&s;ity of due &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to legal authority. Joining all the&s;e circum&s;tances, we may a&s;&s;uredly conclude, that, in Egypt, government was co|eval with the peopling of the country; and this, perhaps, is the &s;ingle in&s;tance of the kind. Government, therefore, mu&s;t have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the Egyptians in an advanced &s;tate; and for that rea&s;on it cea&s;es to be a wonder, that their laws were brought to perfection more early than tho&s;e of any other people.</P>
<P>THIS, at the &s;ame time, accounts for the practice of Hie|roglyphics, peculiar to this country. In the admini&s;tration of publick affairs, writing is, in a great mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary. The Egyptian government had made vigorous advances to|ward perfection before writing was invented. A condition &s;o &s;ingular, behoved to make a &s;trong demand for &s;ome me|thod to publi&s;h laws, and to pre&s;erve them in memory. This produced hieroglyphical writing, if the emblems made u&s;e of to expre&s;s ideas, can be called &s;o.</P>

It grew to &s;uch a height, that the Romans were oblig|ed to impo&s;e another check upon criminal pro&s;ecutors, indeed of the &s;evere&s;t kind, which &s;hall be given in Voet's words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. de accu&s;ationibus &amp; in&s;criptionibus, &sect; 13.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne autem temere quis per accu&s;ationem in alieni capitis di&s;crimen irruerit, neve impunita e&s;&s;et in criminalibus mentiendi atque calumniandi licentia, loco jurisju|randi calumniae adinventa fuit in crimen &s;ub&s;criptio, cujus vinculo cavet qui&s;que quod crimen objecturus &s;it, et in ejus ac|cu&s;atione u&s;que ad &s;ententiam per&s;evera|turus, dato eum in finem fideju&s;&s;ore; &s;i|mulque ad talionem &s;eu &s;imilitudinem &s;upplicii &s;e&s;e ob&s;tringit, &s;i in probatione defeci&s;&s;e &amp; calumniatus e&s;&s;e deprehen&s;us

This would be an ex|ertion of publick &s;pirit, &s;carce to be expec|ted among the mo&s;t virtuous people, not to talk of times of univer&s;al corruption and depravity.</P>
<P>IN modern governments, a better me|thod is invented. The privilege of pro&s;e|cuting publick crimes belongs to the chief magi&s;trate. The King's Advocate in Scot|land is, by his office, <HI>calumniator publicus;</HI> and there is delegated to him from the
<PB N="83" REF="96">
crown, the privilege of pro&s;ecuting publick crimes, when he judges &s;uch pro&s;ecution to be for the intere&s;t of the publick. In Eng|land, per&s;onal liberty has, from the begin|ning, been more &s;acred than in Scotland; and to prevent the oppre&s;&s;ion of criminal pro&s;ecutions, there is in England a regula|tion much more effectual than that now mentioned. No criminal trial, in name of the crown, can proceed, till fir&s;t the mat|ter be examined by the grand jury of the county, and their authority be interpo&s;ed for the pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to private crimes, where individuals are hurt in their per&s;ons, goods, or character, the publick, and per&s;on in|jured, have each of them &s;eparately an in|tere&s;t. The King's Advocate may pro&s;e|cute &s;uch crimes alone, &s;o far as the publick is concerned in the puni&s;hment. The pri|vate party again is intere&s;ted to obtain re|paration for the wrong done him. Even where this is the end of the pro&s;ecution,
<PB N="84" REF="97">
our forms require the concurrence of the King's Advocate, as a check upon the pro|&s;ecutor, who&s;e re&s;entment otherwi&s;e may carry him beyond proper bounds. But this concurrence mu&s;t be granted, unle&s;s the Advocate will take upon him to &s;how, that there is no foundation for the pro&s;ecution; for the Advocate, by with-holding his con|&s;ent, cannot bar the private party from the reparation due him by law, more than the private party, by with-holding his con&s;ent, can bar the Advocate from exacting that reparation or puni&s;hment which is a debt due to the publick.</P>
<P>THE interpo&s;ition of the &s;overeign au|thority, to puni&s;h crimes more &s;everely than by a compo&s;ition, was at fir&s;t, we may be|lieve, not common; nor to be obtained at any rate, unle&s;s where the atrocity of the crime called aloud for an extraordinary pu|ni&s;hment. But it happened in this, as in all &s;imilar ca&s;es, where novelty wears off by reiteration of acts, that what at fir&s;t is an
<PB N="85" REF="98">
extraordinary remedy, comes in time as a common practice, to be reckoned a branch of the common law. During the infancy, however, of this practice, there being no rule e&s;tabli&s;hed for the King's interpo&s;ition, it was under&s;tood to be a branch of his pre|rogative, to interpo&s;e or not at his plea&s;ure; and to direct an extraordinary puni&s;hment, or to leave the crime to the compo&s;ition of the common law. It mu&s;t be evident, that this prerogative could not regularly &s;ub&s;i&s;t after criminal juri&s;diction was totally en|gro&s;&s;ed by the publick, and a criminal was regularly condemned by the &s;olemn &s;entence of a judge. But our fore-fathers were not &s;o clear-&s;ighted. The prerogative now mentioned, was mi&s;apprehended for a power of pardoning even after &s;entence; and the re&s;emblance of the ca&s;es made way for the mi&s;take. It appears to me, that the King's prerogative of pardoning arbitrarily, which is a&s;&s;erted by all lawyers, can have no foun|dation other than this now a&s;&s;igned. Were it limited in criminal as in civil ca&s;es, not
<PB N="86" REF="99">
to give relief but where &s;trict law is over-balanced by equity, the prerogative would have a more rational foundation. But we mu&s;t pro&s;ecute the thread of our hi&s;tory. Though the option of inflicting an adequate puni&s;hment, or leaving the crime to the common law, was imperceptibly converted into an arbitrary power of pardoning even after &s;entence; yet the foundation of this new prerogative was not forgot. The King's pardon is held as leaving the crime to the common law, by which the per&s;on injured is entitled to a compo&s;ition, And the evident inju&s;tice of a pardon upon any other condition, tends no doubt to &s;upport this con&s;truction: for it would be gro&s;s in|ju&s;tice, that the law &s;hould &s;uffer a man to be injured, without affording him any &s;a|tisfaction, either by a publick puni&s;hment, or by a private compo&s;ition. This, how|ever, it would appear, has been attempted. But the matter was &s;ettled by a law of Ed|ward the Confe&s;&s;or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lambard's Collection, Law 18.</NOTE>, declaring, That the
<PB N="87" REF="100">
King, by his prerogative, may pardon a capital crime; but that the criminal mu&s;t, in this ca&s;e, &s;atisfy the per&s;on injured, by a ju&s;t compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IT appears then that the <HI>Vergelt,</HI> or com|po&s;ition for crimes, which obtained in all ca&s;es by our old law, is &s;till in force where the criminal obtains a pardon; and the claim which the relations of the decea&s;ed have again&s;t the murderer who obtains the pardon, known in the law of Scotland by the name of <HI>A&s;&s;ythment,</HI> has no other foun|dation. The practice is carried farther, and may be di&s;covered even in civil actions. When a proce&s;s of defamation is brought before a civil court, or a proce&s;s for any violent inver&s;ion of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a &s;um is ge|nerally decreed in name of damages, pro|portioned to the wrong done; even where the pur&s;uer is not able to &s;pecify any hurt or real damage. Such a &s;entence can have no other view, but to gratify the re&s;ent|ment of the per&s;on injured, who has not
<PB N="88" REF="101">
the gratification of any other puni&s;hment. It is given, as lawyers &s;ay, <HI>in &s;olatium;</HI> and therefore is obviou&s;ly of the nature of a <HI>Vergelt,</HI> or compo&s;ition for a crime. Dama|ges awarded to a hu&s;band, again&s;t the man who corrupts his wife, or again&s;t the man who commits a rape upon her, are preci&s;ely of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>IN taking a review of the whole, the manners and temper of &s;avages afford no agreeable pro&s;pect. But man excells other animals chiefly by being &s;u&s;ceptible of high improvements in a well regulated &s;ociety. In his original &s;olitary &s;tate, he is &s;carce a rational creature. Re&s;entment is a pa&s;&s;ion, that, in an undi&s;ciplined brea&s;t, appears to exceed all rational bounds. But &s;avages, unre&s;trained by law, indulge their appetites without control; and in this &s;tate, re&s;ent|ment, were it more moderate, would, per|haps, &s;carce be &s;ufficient to keep men in awe, and to re&s;train them, in any con&s;ide|rable degree, from mutual injuries.

it is for civilized &s;ocieties, that the autho|rity of law hath, in a good mea&s;ure, ren|dered unnece&s;&s;ary this &s;avage and impetu|ous pa&s;&s;ion; and happy it is for individuals, that early di&s;cipline, under the re&s;traint of law, by calming the temper, and &s;weeten|ing manners, hath rendered it a le&s;s trouble|&s;ome gue&s;t than it is by nature.</P>

COURTS were a noble invention in the &s;ocial &s;tate; for by them individuals are compelled to do their duty. This inven|tion, as generally happens, was originally
<PB N="96" REF="108">
confined within narrow bounds. To take under the protection of a court, natural obligations of every &s;ort, would, in a new experiment, have been reckoned too bold. It was deemed &s;ufficient to en|force, by legal authority, tho&s;e particular duties that contribute the mo&s;t to the well-being of &s;ociety. A regulation &s;o impor|tant gave full &s;atisfaction, and, while re|cent, left no de&s;ire or thought of any far|ther improvement. This fairly accounts for what is ob&s;erved above, that in the in|fancy of law, promi&s;es and agreements which make a figure, are countenanced with an action, while others of le&s;s utili|ty are left upon con&s;cience. But here it mu&s;t be remarked, that this di&s;tinction is not made where the effect of a promi&s;e or agreement is not to create an obligation, but to di&s;&s;olve it. <HI>Pacta liberatoria</HI> have, in all ages, been enforced by courts of law. The rea&s;on commonly a&s;&s;igned, that liber|ty is more favourable than obligation, is not &s;atisfactory; for no pactions merit
<PB N="97" REF="109">
more favour than tho&s;e which promote the good of &s;ociety, by obliging individuals to &s;erve and aid each other. The following rea&s;on will perhaps be reckoned more &s;olid. There is a wide difference betwixt refu&s;ing action, even where the claim is ju&s;t, and &s;u&s;taining action upon an unju&s;t claim. With re&s;pect to the former, all that can be objected is, that the court is le&s;s u&s;eful than it might be. The latter would be directly countenancing, or rather enforc|ing, iniquity. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing to find courts confined, originally, within too nar|row bounds in point of utility: but it would be &s;trange indeed if it were made their duty to enforce wrong of any &s;ort. Thus where a court refu&s;es to make effectual a gratui|tous promi&s;e, there is no harm done: mat|ters are left where they were before courts were in&s;tituted. But it is undoubtedly un|ju&s;t to demand payment of a debt after it is di&s;charged, though by a gratuitous pro|mi&s;e only. And therefore, when in this ca&s;e an action for payment is brought, the
<PB N="98" REF="110">
court has no choice. It cannot otherwi&s;e avoid &s;upporting this unju&s;t claim, but by &s;u&s;taining the gratuitous promi&s;e as a good defence again&s;t the action<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This difference betwixt an action and an exception, ari&s;|ing from the original con&s;titution of courts of law, is not peculiar to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, but obtains univer&s;ally. Thus, in the Roman law, the <HI>exceptiones doli et metus,</HI> were &s;u&s;tained from the beginning; though for many ages after the Roman courts were e&s;tabli&s;hed, no action was afforded to re|dre&s;s wrong done by fraud or force.

<P>ONE ca&s;e excepted, &s;imilar to the Ro|man <HI>&s;tipulatio,</HI> of which afterwards, it ap|pears to me that no naked promi&s;e or co|venant was, by our forefathers, counte|nanced with an action. A contract of buy|ing and &s;elling was certainly not binding by the municipal law of this i&s;land, unle&s;s the price were paid, or the thing &s;old delivered. There was <HI>locus penitentiae</HI> even after arles were given; and change of mind was at|tended with no other penalty, but lo&s;s of

<P>THE ca&s;e hinted above as an exception, is where an agreement is made or acknow|ledged in the face of court, taken down in writing, and recorded in the books of the court<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Glanvil, L. 10. Cap. 8. Reg. Maj. L. 3. Cap. 4.</NOTE>.

And indeed the recording a tran&s;action would be an idle &s;olemnity, if the parties were not bound by it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="112">
THE occa&s;ion of introducing this form, I conjecture to be what follows. In diffi|cult or intricate ca&s;es, it was an early prac|tice for judges to interpo&s;e, by pre&s;&s;ing a tran&s;action betwixt the parties; of which we have &s;ome in&s;tances in the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, not far back. This practice brought about many agreements betwixt litigants, which were always recorded in the court where the proce&s;s depended. The record was compleat evidence of the fact; and if either party broke the concord or agree|ment, a decree went again&s;t him without other proof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Glanvil, L. 8. Cap. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The &s;ingular advantages of a concord or tran&s;action, thus fini&s;hed in face of court, moved individuals to make all their agreements, of any importance, in that form. And indeed, while writing continued a rare art, &s;kilful arti&s;ts, except in courts of ju&s;tice, were not ea&s;ily found, who could readily take down a covenant in writing.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="113">
SO much upon the fir&s;t head, how far naked covenants and promi&s;es were effectual by our old law. What proof of a bargain was required by a court of ju&s;tice, comes next to be examined. Evidence may ju&s;tly be di&s;tingui&s;hed into natural and artificial. To the former belong proof by witne&s;&s;es, by confe&s;&s;ion of the party, and by writing. To the latter belong tho&s;e extraordinary methods invented in days of gro&s;s &s;u|per&s;tition, for bringing out the truth in doubtful ca&s;es, &s;uch as the trial by fire, the trial by water, and &s;ingular battle.</P>
<P>BEFORE writing was invented, or rather while, like painting, it was in the hands of a few arti&s;ts, witne&s;&s;es behoved to be relyed on for evidence in all ca&s;es. Witne&s;&s;es, in particular, were admitted for proving a debt to whatever extent, as well as for prov|ing payment of it. But experience di&s;co|vered both the danger and uncertainty of &s;uch evidence; which, therefore, was con|fined within narrower bounds gradually as
<PB N="102" REF="114">
the art of writing became more common. It was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed that two witne&s;&s;es were not &s;ufficient to prove a debt above forty &s;hillings; and that the number of witne&s;&s;es behoved to be in proportion to the extent of the debt. Afterwards, when the art of writing was more diffu&s;ed, the King's courts took upon them to confine the proof of debt to writing, and the confe&s;&s;ion of the party, leaving the inferior judges to fol|low the common law, by admitting debt to be proved by witne&s;&s;es. This &s;eems to be the import of Quon. Attach. Cap. 81. and the only proper &s;en&s;e that it can bear. The burghs adhered the longe&s;t to the com|mon law, by admitting two witne&s;&s;es to prove debt to any extent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Curia quatuor Burg. Cap. 3. &sect; 6.</NOTE>. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This limitation of proof regards the con&s;titution only of a debt. Payment being a more favourable plea, was left to the common law; and accordingly, in England, parole evidence, to this day, is admitted to prove payment of money. The rule was the &s;ame in Scotland while our &s;overeign court, named <HI>the Daily Council,</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; witne&s;s the records of that court &s;till pre&s;erved; and continued to be the rule till the Act of Sederunt, 8th June 1597, was made, declaring the re&s;olution of the court, That thereafter they would not ad|mit witne&s;&s;es to prove payment of any &s;um above 100 Pounds.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="115">
THE King's courts a&s;&s;umed the like pri|vilege in other actions. Though they ad|mitted witne&s;&s;es to prove that a contract of &s;ale, for example, or location, was per|formed in part, in order to be a foundation for decreeing full performance; yet they allowed nothing to be proved by witne&s;&s;es, but what is cu&s;tomary in every covenant of the &s;ort. If any &s;ingular paction was in|&s;i&s;ted on, &s;uch as an irritancy <HI>ob non &s;olutum canonem,</HI> witne&s;&s;es were not admitted to prove &s;uch pactions, more than to prove a claim of debt. The proof was confined to writ, or confe&s;&s;ion of the party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Glanvil, L. 10. Cap. ult. Reg. Maj. L. 3. Cap. 14. &sect; ult.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;pecies of natural evidence is, confe&s;&s;ion of the party; which, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, behoved to be a confe&s;&s;ion; that is, it behoved to be voluntary. For, by the original law of this i&s;land, no man was bound to bear te&s;timony again&s;t him|&s;elf, whether in civil or criminal cau&s;es. So &s;tands the common law of England to
<PB N="104" REF="116">
this day; though courts of equity take greater liberty. Our law was the &s;ame, till it came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, through the influence of the Roman law, that in civil actions, the facts &s;et forth in the libel, or declaration, may be referred to the defend|ant's te&s;timony, and he be held as confe&s;t, if he refu&s;e to give his oath. The tran&s;i|tion was ea&s;y from civil matters, to the &s;lighter delinquencies which are puni&s;hed with pecuniary penalties; and in the&s;e al&s;o, by our pre&s;ent practice, the per&s;on accu&s;ed is, in a civil court, obliged to give evi|dence again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE di&s;covery of truth, by oath of par|ty, denied in civil courts, was, in the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical court, obtained by a circuit. An action for payment could not be brought before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court; but, in a re|ligious view, a complaint could be brought for breach of faith and promi&s;e. The party, as in the pre&s;ence of GOD, was bound to declare, whether he had not made
<PB N="105" REF="117">
the promi&s;e. By this oath, the truth be|ing drawn from him, he was of cour&s;e enjoined, not only to do penance, but al&s;o to &s;atisfy the complainer. This was, in effect, a decree which was followed with the mo&s;t rigorous execution for ob|taining payment of the debt. And this, by the by, is the foundation of the privi|lege which our commi&s;&s;ary courts have of judging in actions of debt, when the debt is referred to oath.</P>
<P>THE third &s;pecies of natural evidence is writ, which is of two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> record of court, and writ executed privately betwixt parties. The fir&s;t kind, which has already been mentioned, is, in England, termed <HI>Recognizance,</HI> becau&s;e debt is there acknow|ledged. And here it mu&s;t be carefully re|marked, that this writ is of it&s;elf compleat evidence, &s;o as to admit of no contrary averment, as expre&s;&s;ed in the Engli&s;h law. With re&s;pect again to a private writ, it is laid down, that if the defendant deny the
<PB N="106" REF="118">
&s;eal, the pur&s;uer mu&s;t verify the &s;ame by witne&s;&s;es, or by compari&s;on of &s;eals; but that if he acknowledge it to be his &s;eal, he is not admitted to deny the writ<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Glanvil, L. 10. Cap. 12. Reg. Maj. L. 3. Cap. 8.</NOTE>. The pre&s;umption lies, that it was he him&s;elf who &s;ealed the writ; unle&s;s he can bring evi|dence, that the &s;eal was &s;tole from him, and put to the writ by another.</P>
<P>A deed hath &s;prung from the Recogniz|ance, which requires peculiar attention. In England it is termed <HI>a Bond in Judgment,</HI> and with us <HI>a Bond regi&s;trable.</HI> When, by peace and regular government, this i&s;land came to be better peopled than formerly, it was extremely cumber&s;ome to go before the judge upon every private bargain, in order to munute and record the &s;ame. After the art of writing was &s;pread every where, a method was contrived to render this mat|ter more ea&s;y. The agreement is taken down in writing; and, with the &s;ame breath, a mandate is granted to a procurator to ap|pear
<PB N="107" REF="119">
in court, and to obtain the writing to be recorded as the agreement of &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons. If the parties happen to dif|fer in executing the agreement, the writing is put upon record by virtue of the mandate, and faith is given to it by the court, not le&s;s than if the agreement had been re|corded originally. The authority of the mandate is not called in que&s;tion, being joined with the averment of the procurator. And, from the nature of the thing, if faith be at all given to writ, the mind mu&s;t re&s;t upon &s;ome fact which is taken for granted without witne&s;&s;es. A bond, for example, is vouched by the &s;ub&s;cription of the granter, and the granter's &s;ub&s;cription by that of one or more witne&s;&s;es. But the &s;ub&s;cription of a witne&s;s mu&s;t be held as true; for otherwi&s;e there behoved to be a chain of proof without end, and a writing could never be legal evidence. The &s;ame &s;olemnity is not nece&s;&s;ary to the mandate, which being a relative deed, is &s;upported by the bond or agreement to which it relates;
<PB N="108" REF="120">
and therefore, of &s;uch a mandate, we do not require any evidence be&s;ides the &s;ub&s;cription of the party. The &s;tile of this mandate was afterwards improved, and made to &s;erve a double purpo&s;e; not only to be an autho|rity for recording the writ, but al&s;o to im|power the procurator to confe&s;s judgment again&s;t his employer; upon which a decree pa&s;&s;es of cour&s;e, in order for execution. The mandate was originally contained in a &s;eparate writing, which is the practice in England to this day. In Scotland, the practice fir&s;t crept in of indor&s;ing it upon the bond, and afterwards of ingro&s;&s;ing it in the bond at the clo&s;e, which is our pre|&s;ent form.</P>
<P>COMPARING the law of England and of Scotland, upon the evidence of writ, I can di&s;cover no di&s;crepance betwixt them. For, fir&s;t, as to regi&s;trable writs, or bonds in judgment, the&s;e do and mu&s;t bear full faith; becau&s;e, without other evidence, they are a &s;ufficient foundation for execution. Such
<PB N="109" REF="121">
a writ, when put upon record, produces a decree, which cannot be challenged but in a proce&s;s of reduction or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; and in England it is a rule, that matters of record prove them&s;elves, and admit of no averment again&s;t the truth of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Abridgment of the Law, vol. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>. In the next place, as to a private writ, u&s;ed as evidence in a proce&s;s, it appears from the Regiam Maje&s;tatem, compared with Glan|vil in the pa&s;&s;ages above cited, that the law was al&s;o the &s;ame in both countries. In England, to this day, a party may deny the verity of the writ, by pleading <HI>quod non e&s;t factum.</HI> But then it is not enough bare|ly to deny, without undertaking a proof. What I am to &s;ugge&s;t, will make it evident, that <HI>non e&s;t factum</HI> is a proper exception, which, like all other exceptions, mu&s;t be verified by evidence. One needs but reflect, that a bond &s;igned &s;ealed and delivered, makes an effectual obligation by the law of England, and is therefore a good founda|tion for an action. This is in other words
<PB N="110" REF="122">
&s;aying, that &s;uch bond is probative, and requires not the &s;upport of extraneous evi|dence: and if &s;o, it cannot be &s;ufficient for the defendant to re&s;t upon a denial, with|out attempting, by contrary evidence, to di&s;prove the evidence of the bond. To this end he has an opportunity to produce the in&s;trumentary witne&s;&s;es. But if the&s;e be dead, it is a rule in England, as well as in Scotland, that they prove the verity of the writing; which, in plain &s;en&s;e, comes to this, that every thing &s;aid in the bond, is pre&s;umed to be true, until the contrary be proved. This is, in every point, agree|able to the law of Scotland; for which, in place of all other authority, I appeal to Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 4. Tit. 40. &sect; 39, 40.</NOTE>, who lays down in expre&s;s terms, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That again&s;t regi&s;trable writs, im|probation ought not to be &s;u&s;tained by exception, but only by action; but that again&s;t other writs, improbation may be proponed by way of exception."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="123">
I cannot, upon this occa&s;ion, overlook a remarkable impropriety in our old &s;ta|tutes, requiring witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ub&s;cription of an obligor, without enjoining the wit|ne&s;&s;es to &s;ub&s;cribe, in token that they did witne&s;s the obligor's &s;ub&s;cription. To ap|point any act to be done, without requir|ing any evidence of its having been done, is undoubtedly an idle regulation. The te&s;ting clau&s;e, it is true, bears, that the obli|gor &s;ub&s;cribed before &s;uch and &s;uch wit|ne&s;&s;es. But the te&s;ting clau&s;e, which, in point of time, goes before the &s;ub&s;cription of the obligor, cannot otherwi&s;e than pro|phetically be evidence, that the witne&s;&s;es named &s;aw the obligor &s;ub&s;cribe. This blunder is not found in the Engli&s;h law: for tho' witne&s;&s;es are generally called, and do often &s;ub&s;cribe; yet, according to my information, witne&s;&s;es are not e&s;&s;ential by the law of England. It is &s;ufficient to &s;pe|cify in the declaration, that the bond was &s;igned &s;ealed and delivered. Of the &s;ign|ing and &s;ealing, the bond it&s;elf is evidence;
<PB N="112" REF="124">
and it is legal evidence of the delive|ry, that the bond is produced by the obligee.</P>
<P>THIS blunder, in our law, is corrected by the &s;tatute 1681, enacting, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That none but &s;ub&s;cribing witne&s;&s;es &s;hall be proba|tive, and not witne&s;&s;es in&s;ert not &s;ub|&s;cribing."</Q> By this regulation, the evi|dence of writ is now, with us, more com|pleat than it is in England. The &s;ub&s;crip|tions of the witne&s;&s;es are ju&s;tly held legal evidence of their having witne&s;&s;ed the &s;ub|&s;cription of the granter of the deed; and the &s;ub&s;criptions mu&s;t be held their &s;ub&s;crip|tions; otherwi&s;e, as above ob&s;erved, no writ could in any ca&s;e afford legal evidence. And thus the evidence required in Scotland, to give faith to a bond, or other deed, is by this &s;tatute made proper and rational. It is required that the granter &s;ub&s;cribe be|fore witne&s;&s;es: but we no longer hold the te&s;ting clau&s;e to be evidence of this fact.

<P>IT is probable, that as &s;ingular battle gave place to the oath of purgation, &s;o this oath gave place to juries.

Sin|gular battle wearing out of repute, the un|ju&s;tice of burdening with a proof of inno|cence, every per&s;on who is accu&s;ed, was clearly perceived; and witne&s;&s;es being now more frequently employed on the part of the pro&s;ecutor to prove guilt, than on the part of the defendant to prove innocence, it was thought proper that they &s;hould be cho&s;en by the judge, not by the defendant.

If it be demanded, why not by the pro&s;e|cutor as at pre&s;ent? It is an&s;wered, That at that time the innovation would have been reckoned too violent. However this be, one thing appears from Glanvil<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 2. Cap. 7. to the end of that book.</NOTE>, That in all di&s;putes concerning the property of land, founded on the brieve of right, a pri|vilege was about that time be&s;towed on the defendant, to have the cau&s;e tried by a jury, in place of &s;ingular battle. As this was an innovation authorized by rea&s;on, and not by &s;tatute, it was probably at fir&s;t attempted in que&s;tions upon the brieve of right only; matters of le&s;s importance be|ing left upon the oath of purgation. That a jury trial, and the oath of purgation, were in u&s;e both of them at the &s;ame time, we have evidence from the Regiam Maje|&s;tatem<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 4. Cap.

The new method of trial by a jury, was &s;o evidently preferable
<PB N="119" REF="131">
to the other, that it would &s;oon become univer&s;al, and be extended to all ca&s;es civil and criminal; and in fact, we find it &s;o extended &s;o far back as we have any di|&s;tinct records.</P>
<P>FROM this deduction it appears, that a jury was originally a number of witne&s;&s;es cho&s;en by the judge, in order to declare the truth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See. Reg. Maj. L. 1. Cap. 12.</NOTE>. And hence the proce&s;s again&s;t a jury for perjury and wilful error. This explains al&s;o why the verdict of a jury is final, even where they are convicted of per|jury. Singular battle, from the nature of the thing, was &s;o: the oath of purgation, in place of &s;ingular battle, was &s;o; and a verdict, in place of an oath of purgation, is &s;o. It likewi&s;e explains the practice of England, that the jury mu&s;t be unanimous in their verdict; for it was required, that the compurgators &s;hould be &s;o in their oath of purgation. The &s;ame rule probably ob|tained in Scotland: but at pre&s;ent, and &s;o
<PB N="120" REF="132">
far back as our records carry us, the verdict is fixed by the votes of the majority.</P>
<P>IN later times, the nature and office of a jury were altered. Through the difficul|ty of procuring twelve proper witne&s;&s;es ac|quainted with the facts, twelve men of &s;kill and integrity were cho&s;en, to judge of the evidence produced by the litigants. The cau&s;e of this alteration may be gue&s;&s;ed, admitting only that the pre&s;ent &s;trict forms of a jury trial were at fir&s;t not in u&s;e. If jury-men, con&s;idered as witne&s;&s;es, differed, or were uncertain about the facts, they would naturally demand extraneous evi|dence; of which, when brought, it be|longed to them to judge. It is likely that, for centuries, jury-men acted thus both as witne&s;&s;es and as judges. They may, it is certain, do &s;o at this day; though, for the rea&s;on above given, they are commonly cho&s;en by rotation, without being regarded in the character of witne&s;&s;es. Hence it is, that a jury is now con&s;idered chiefly as
<PB N="121" REF="133">
judges of the fact, and &s;carce at all as a body of witne&s;&s;es. And this explains why the proce&s;s for perjury again&s;t them is laid a&s;ide. This proce&s;s cannot take place again&s;t judges, but only again&s;t witne&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>MAN, by his nature, is fitted for &s;ociety, and &s;ociety is fitted for man by its manifold conveniencies. The perfection of human &s;ociety, con&s;i&s;ts in that ju&s;t degree of union
<PB N="125" REF="136">
among individuals, which to each re&s;erves freedom and independency, &s;o far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with peace and good order. The bonds of &s;ociety may be too lax; but they may al&s;o be over&s;tretched. A &s;ociety, where every man &s;hould be bound to dedi|cate the whole of his indu&s;try to the com|mon intere&s;t, would be of the &s;tricte&s;t kind. But it would be unnatural and incomfort|able, becau&s;e de&s;tructive of liberty and in|dependency. The enjoyment of the goods of fortune in common, would, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be not le&s;s unnatural and incomfort|able. Another rea&s;on may be added. There &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in man a remarkable propen&s;ity for appropriation, which makes us aver&s;e to a communion of goods, &s;ome &s;ingular ca&s;es excepted. And happy it is for man to be thus con&s;tituted. Indu&s;try, in a great mea&s;ure, depends on property; and a much greater ble&s;&s;ing depends on it, which is the gratification of the mo&s;t dignified na|tural affections. What place would there. be for genero&s;ity, benevolence, or charity,
<PB N="126" REF="137">
if the goods of fortune were common to all? The&s;e noble principles, being de&s;titute of objects and exerci&s;e, would for ever lie dormant; and what would man be without them? Truly a very groveling creature; di|&s;tingui&s;hable indeed from the brutes, but &s;carce elevated above them. Gratitude and compa&s;&s;ion might have &s;ome &s;light ex|erci&s;e; but how much greater is the figure they make in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things?

<P>HUNTING and fi&s;hing were originally the occupations of man, upon which chiefly he depended for food. The bea&s;t caught in a gin, or the fi&s;h with a hook, being the purcha&s;e of art and indu&s;try, were un|doubtedly, from the beginning, con&s;idered by all as belonging to the occupant. The &s;trong appetite which man has for appro|priation,
<PB N="127" REF="138">
vouches this to be true: but what were the preci&s;e boundaries of the relation thus created betwixt the hunter or fi&s;her, and his prey, and what powers were ac|quired by the former over the latter, in common e&s;timation, is a que&s;tion of more intricacy. That this relation implies a power to u&s;e for &s;u&s;tenance the creature thus taken, and towards that end to defend the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t every invader, is ex|tremely clear. But &s;uppo&s;ing the creature to have been lo&s;t, and without violence to have come into the hands of another, I do not clearly &s;ee that, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, the original occupant would have had any claim, or that re&s;titution would have been reckoned the duty of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. This may be thought Sceptical; for to one who has imbibed the refined principles of law, the conception is familiar of a relation be|twixt a man and a &s;ubject, &s;o intimate, as not to be di&s;&s;olvable without his con&s;ent: but, in the inve&s;tigation of original laws, nothing is more apt to lead into error, than
<PB N="128" REF="139">
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion derived from modern improve|ments. It appears to me extremely pro|bable, that among &s;avages involved in ob|jects of &s;en&s;e, and &s;trangers to ab&s;tract &s;pe|culation, property and the rights or moral powers ari&s;ing from it, never are with ac|accuracy di&s;tingui&s;hed from the natural powers, which mu&s;t be exerted upon the &s;ubject to make it profitable to the po&s;&s;e&s;s|or. The man who kills and eats, who &s;ows and reaps, at his own plea&s;ure, indepen|dent of another's will, is naturally deemed proprietor. The gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;avages can ap|prehend power without right, of which they are made &s;en&s;ible by daily acts of vio|lence: but it requires a habit of ab&s;traction, to conceive right or moral power indepen|dent of natural power; becau&s;e in this con|dition, right, being attended with no vi|&s;ible effect, is a mental conception merely. That a man may be deprived of a &s;ubject, and yet retain the property, is a le&s;&s;on too intricate for a &s;avage. For how can this be, it will be ob&s;erved, when he has not
<PB N="129" REF="140">
the u&s;e of the &s;ubject, and has no power over it? Hence as a &s;ubject, in order for enjoyment, mu&s;t be under the power of the proprietor, and con&s;equently in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, I infer, that, in the original concep|tion of property, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was an e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance, and that when the latter was lo&s;t, the former could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t. I confirm this inference by the following ob&s;ervation. To this day the vulgar can form no di&s;tinct conception of property, otherwi&s;e than by figuring the man in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, u&s;ing the &s;ubject without control, and according to his own will. If &s;uch be at pre&s;ent the vulgar way of thinking, we may rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect a &s;till greater ob&s;cu|rity in the conceptions of a &s;avage.</P>
<P>BUT though originally property was lo&s;t with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it follows not that it was always acquired with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. That property cannot be acquired by theft, or other immoral act, is a &s;entiment dictated by nature; and which therefore influences
<PB N="130" REF="141">
even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;avages. Hence it be|hoyed to be a rule, that though property is lo&s;t by theft, it is not acquired by theft. Here is a clear foundation laid for obliging the thief to re&s;tore. He has no title to re|tain a &s;ubject which, though in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, is not his property; and he is be&s;ides bound in con&s;cience to repair the damage done by him to the per&s;on formerly pro|prietor, by re&s;toring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which of cour&s;e re&s;tores the property. But this claim of re&s;titution, evidently reaches not any per&s;on who has acquired the &s;ubject by hone&s;t means, and who having done no wrong, cannot be liable to make any repa|ration.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this &s;ubject, I figure the ca&s;e of a hor&s;e carried off by theft, which, af|ter pa&s;&s;ing through &s;everal hands, is fairly purcha&s;ed in open market. Let us &s;ee what arguments are &s;ugge&s;ted by rea&s;on on either &s;ide; and after weighing the&s;e arguments, let natural ju&s;tice pronounce &s;entence. The
<PB N="131" REF="142">
claimant urges, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was deprived of his hor&s;e by theft."</Q> The Purcha&s;er an|&s;wers, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he had no acce&s;&s;ion to the theft, and that the thief alone is liable."</Q> The claimant again urges, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a man may lay hold of his own goods where|ever they are found."</Q> An&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The hor&s;e was the property of the claimant, while in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but the property was lo&s;t with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the connection of property ari&s;ing from an hone&s;t bargain, and a full price paid, is of the &s;tronge&s;t kind."</Q> Betwixt preten|&s;ions &s;o equally balanced, how can a judge otherwi&s;e interpo&s;e than by pronouncing, <HI>quod potior e&s;t conditio po&s;&s;identis?</HI> And that antiently this was the rule, may be gather|ed from traces of it, which, to this day, re|main in &s;everal countries. By the old law of Germany, the proprietor could demand

his goods from the per&s;on to whom he de|livered them, in order to be re&s;tored; be|cau&s;e this claim is founded on a contract.

This action being merely per&s;onal, and founded on the delinquency of the defendant, takes it for granted, that the pur&s;uer had, by the theft, lo&s;t his property; and accord|ingly the action is calculated to re&s;tore the property to the pur&s;uer, by compelling the defendant to yield the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to him. Afterwards, &s;o &s;oon as property was di&s;tingui&s;hed from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and theft was held not &s;ufficient to deprive a man of his property, a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> was given.

<P>WE find traces of the &s;ame way of thinking in other mat|ters. A man who, by force or fear, was compelled to &s;ell his &s;ubject at an undervalue, had no redre&s;s by the common law of the Romans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;on of this is given in the &s;econd Tract.</NOTE>. It was the Pretor who fir&s;t took upon him to re&s;tore <HI>in integrum,</HI> by an action, tho&s;e who were thus deprived of their property. This action originally was &s;trict|ly per&s;onal, being directed again&s;t the wrong doer only; nor could it be extended again&s;t a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;er, &s;o long as property was held to vani&s;h when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was lo&s;t. For though, by the law of nature, no man is bound by a covenant which by force or fear he is compelled to make, yet when delivery is made, and the &s;ubject is acquired by a third party, who purcha&s;es <HI>bona fide,</HI> an action of re&s;titution could not lie again&s;t him. The claimant, who lo&s;t his pro|perty with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, had not a <HI>rei vindicatio;</HI> and a per|&s;onal action could not lie again&s;t a purcha&s;er who had no ac|ce&s;&s;ion to the wrong. But after the doctrine prevailed, That property can &s;ub&s;i&s;t independent of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it came natu|rally to be a &s;ubject of deliberation, whether a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> might not lie in this ca&s;e again&s;t the <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;er, as well as where a &s;ubject is robbed or &s;tolen without the forma|lity of a contract.

they were the &s;ame; not even excepting the ca&s;e of &s;tolen goods. Our act 26, p. 1661, vouches it to have been the law of Scot|land, that when a thief was condemned, his effects, including the &s;tolen goods, were confi&s;cated. Nor is this law abrogated to|tally by the &s;tatute. The proprietor can|not demand his goods, except upon condi|tion that he pro&s;ecute the thief <HI>u&s;que ad &s;ententiam.</HI> Such being the law with re|gard to &s;tolen goods, we cannot doubt, that a man purcha&s;ing <HI>bona fide</HI> from a vender, who is not proprietor, was &s;ecure again&s;t this claim of property. That &s;uch was the prac|tice, may be gathered from many pa&s;&s;ages in our ancient law-books. In point of evi|dence, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one fact. A regulation appears to have been early intro|duced, prohibiting buying and &s;elling except in open market. The purpo&s;e undoubtedly was to repre&s;s theft, and to prevent the transference of property by private bar|gains. It is not &s;afe to venture &s;tolen goods in open market; and if they be di&s;po&s;ed of
<PB N="137" REF="148">
privately, the buyer cannot be &s;ecure who purcha&s;es <HI>prohibente lege</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COKE<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In&s;tit. 2. p. 713.</NOTE> &s;eems not to have under&s;tood this matter, when he can find no cau&s;e for the regulation, other than the encou|ragement of fairs and markets, in order to promote com|merce. This implies, that formerly a purcha&s;e, even in open market, afforded no &s;ecurity again&s;t the proprietor; and that the legi&s;lature, to encourage fairs and markets, could think of no better expedient, than to render property precarious, and to &s;ubject individuals to frequent forfeitures. A mea&s;ure &s;o unju&s;t and &s;o violent, is not agreeable to the genius of the law of England. This regulation (as in the text) was introduced to &s;ecure property, not to unhinge it; which al&s;o appears from the two &s;tatutes mentioned by our author, confining the privilege of tho&s;e who purcha&s;e in open market within the narrowe&s;t bounds. By the lat|ter, <HI>viz.</HI> 31&s;t of Eli&s;abeth, no per&s;on is in &s;afety to buy a hor&s;e even in open market, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;ufficient or cre|dible per&s;on vouch for the vender. And even in that ca&s;e, the hor&s;e mu&s;t be re&s;tored to the proprietor claiming within &s;ix months, and offering the price that was paid by the <HI>bona &s;ide</HI> purcha&s;er.</NOTE>. I have another fact to urge, which is no &s;light confirmation of what is here &s;ugge&s;ted. By the olde&s;t law of the Romans, a &s;ingle year compleated the pre&s;cription of moveables; which te&s;ti|fies, that property independent of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was con&s;idered to be a right of the &s;len|dere&s;t kind. In later times, when the rela|tion
<PB N="138" REF="149">
of property was &s;o &s;trengthned as to be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, this pre|&s;cription was, among the Romans, extended to ten years; and with us a man, by pre&s;crip|tion, is not deprived of the mo&s;t trifling move|able in a &s;horter time than forty years.</P>
<P>BUT if &s;uch originally was the law of property, by what over-ruling principle has property acquired &s;trength and energy to affect the &s;ubject wherever found, and to exclude even an hone&s;t purcha&s;er, where the title of his author is di&s;covered to be lame? This que&s;tion enters deep into the hi&s;tory of law, and the an&s;wer to it mu&s;t be drawn, partly from natural, partly from political principles. It will appear, in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, that both have concurred to be&s;tow upon property that degree of firm|ne&s;s and &s;tability which at pre&s;ent it enjoys among all civilized nations.

MAN, by the frame of his body, is un|qualified to be an animal of prey.

In old times there was but one meal a day; which continued to be the fa&s;hion, even after great luxury was indulged in other re&s;pects. In the war which Xerxes made upon Greece, it was plea&s;antly &s;aid of the Abderites, who were appointed to provide for the King's table, that they ought to go in a general proce&s;&s;ion, and acknowledge the favour of the gods, in not inclining Xerxes to eat twice a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, L. 7.</NOTE>.

Our hi&s;torian, Hector Boyes, exclaims again&s;t the growing luxury of his time, that, not &s;a|tisfied with two meals, &s;ome men were &s;o gluttonous as to eat thrice every day. Cu&s;tom, no doubt, has a powerful ef|fect in this ca&s;e, as well as in many others: but the human frame is not &s;o much under the power of cu&s;tom, as to make it ea&s;y for a man, like an eagle, to fa&s;t perhaps for a month.</NOTE>.

By this invention, the conve|niencies of living were greatly promoted: and in this &s;tate, which makes the &s;econd &s;tage of the &s;ocial life, the relation of pro|perty, though not entirely disjoined from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was con&s;iderably enlivened. The care and attention be&s;towed upon a do|me&s;tic animal from the time of its birth, form in the mind of every one a &s;trong connection betwixt the man and his bea&s;t, which, upon any ca&s;ual interruption of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, does not &s;o readily vani&s;h, as in the ca&s;e of a wild bea&s;t &s;eized by a hunter.</P>
<P>THUS, by a natural principle, the rela|tion of property was in &s;ome mea&s;ure for|tified, and was con&s;idered, as forming a &s;tricter connection betwixt man and other animals than it did originally. In this con|dition, a political principle contributed to make the relation appear &s;till more inti|mate. Experience demon&s;trated, that it is impracticable to repre&s;s theft and robbery,

To remedy an evil which gave &s;o great &s;cope to &s;tealth and violence, the regulation above mentioned was, in this i&s;|land, introduced among our Saxon ance&s;|tors, prohibiting all buying and &s;elling ex|cept in open market. After this regula|tion, a private purcha&s;e afforded no &s;ecurity, nor was the property transferred. The <HI>nexus,</HI> or lien of property, was greatly &s;trengthned, when it was now become law, that no man could be deprived of his property without his own con&s;ent; except &s;ingly in the ca&s;e of a purcha&s;e <HI>bona fide</HI> in open market. I add, upon this head, that the notion of right independent of natural power, once evolved, acquired the greate&s;t firmne&s;s and &s;tability, by the regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of courts of ju&s;tice, the great purpo&s;e of which is to afford natural power, whenever it is
<PB N="142" REF="153">
of u&s;e to make right or moral power effec|tual.</P>
<P>AND, by the way, the influence of pro|perty, in its different &s;tages of improvement, is extremely remarkable. The <HI>nexus,</HI> or lien of property, being originally &s;light, it was not thought unju&s;t to deprive a man of his property by means of a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;e, even where the &s;ubject was &s;old by a robber. The law, which re&s;trained purcha&s;es except in open market, be&s;towed a firmne&s;s upon the relation of property, which made it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, prevail over the right ari&s;ing from a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;e. This produced the &s;tatute above mentioned, 31&s;t of Eli&s;a|beth, enacting, That even a <HI>bona fide</HI> pur|cha&s;e, in open market, &s;hall not transfer the property, provided the proprietor claim within &s;ix months, and offer to the pur|cha&s;er the price he paid. So &s;tands the law of England to this day; and yet to &s;uch &s;tability has the relation of property arrived by the cour&s;e of time, and by the
<PB N="143" REF="154">
favour of all men, that it is doubtful, whe|ther, at pre&s;ent, the claim of property would not be &s;u&s;tained, even without offering the price. In Scotland there is a regulation, of a very old date, for the &s;ecurity of property. Be&s;ides buying in open market, the purcha&s;er is bound to take from the vender &s;ecurity for his hone&s;ty, termed, <HI>Borgh of haim-hald.</HI> By this precaution the purcha&s;er was &s;ecure again&s;t all the world. But if the goods came to be claimed by the true owner, the cautioner was bound to pro|duce the vender, otherwi&s;e to be liable for damages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leg. Burg. Cap. 128.</NOTE>. But though this continues to be our &s;tatute law, &s;uch however is the in|fluence of property, that I doubt whether our judges would not be in hazard of &s;u|&s;taining a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> again&s;t the purcha&s;er in open market, even after u&s;ing the forgo|ing precaution. Property, it is certain, is a great favourite of human nature, and is frequently the object of a very &s;trong affec|tion. In the fluctuating &s;tate of human
<PB N="144" REF="155">
affairs, before regular governments were formed, property was &s;eldom &s;o permanent as to afford great &s;cope for this affection. But in peaceable times, under a &s;teady ad|mini&s;tration of law, the affection for pro|perty becomes exceeding &s;trong, which, of con&s;equence, fortifies greatly the relation of property. Thus there is di&s;covered a natural connection betwixt government and property. From the weak and infantine &s;tate in which both are found originally, both of them, by equal degrees of improve|ment, have arrived at that &s;tability and per|fection which they enjoy at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>HAVING advanced &s;o far in the hi&s;tory of moveable property, it is full time to turn our view to the property of land. In the two fir&s;t &s;tages of the &s;ocial life, while men were hunters or &s;hepherds, there &s;carce could be any notion of land-property. Men being &s;trangers to agriculture, and al&s;o to the art of building, if it was not of huts, which could be rai&s;ed or demoli&s;hed in a moment,
<PB N="145" REF="156">
had no fixed habitations, but wandred about in hords or clans, in order to find pa&s;ture for their cattle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE Scythians drawing no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the plough, but from cattle, and having no cities nor inclo&s;ed places, made their carts &s;erve them for hou&s;es: by which it was ea&s;y for them to move from place to place. Herodotus<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book 4.</NOTE> from this ob&s;erves, that the Scythians are never to be found by an enemy they chu&s;e to avoid.</NOTE>. In this vagrant life men had &s;carce any connection with land more than with air or water. A field of gra&s;s might be con&s;idered as belonging to a hord or clan, while they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and &s;o might the air in which they breathed, and the water of which they drunk: but the mo|ment they removed to another quarter, there no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted any connection be|twixt them and the field that was de&s;erted. It lay open to new-comers, who had the &s;ame right as if it had not been formerly occupied. Hence I conclude, that while men led the life of &s;hepherds, there was no relation formed betwixt them and land, in any manner &s;o di&s;tinct as to obtain the name of Property<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the de&s;cription given by Thucydides of the original &s;tate of Greece. Book 1. at the beginning.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="157">
AGRICULTURE, which makes the third &s;tage of the &s;ocial life, produced the rela|tion of land-property. A man who has be&s;towed labour in preparing a field for the plough, and who has improved this field by artful culture, forms in his mind a very in|timate connection with it. He contracts, by degrees, a &s;ingular affection for a &s;pot, which, in a manner, is the workman&s;hip of his own hands. He chu&s;es to live there, and there to depo&s;it his bones. It is an object which fills his mind, and is never out of thought at home or abroad. After a &s;ummer's expedition, or perhaps years of a foreign war, he returns with avidity to his own hou&s;e, and to his own field, there to pa&s;s his time in ea&s;e and plenty. By &s;uch trials the relation of property being gradu|ally evolved, is disjoined from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and to this disjunction, the lively perception of property with re&s;pect to an object &s;o con&s;iderable, mainly contributes. If a pro|prietor happen to be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his ab|&s;ence, the inju&s;tice done, in depriving him
<PB N="147" REF="158">
of the exerci&s;e of his property, is perceived and acknowledged. In the common &s;en&s;e of mankind he continues proprietor, and a <HI>rei vindicatio</HI> will be &s;u&s;tained to him a|gain&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, to whom the property cannot be transferred by an immoral act. But what if the &s;ubject, after a long inter|val, be purcha&s;ed <HI>bona fide,</HI> and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion attained? I have given my rea|&s;ons above, for conjecturing, that in ancient times, &s;uch a purcha&s;e transferred property, and extingui&s;hed the right of the former proprietor. Such undoubtedly was once the condition of moveable property, gradually altered, as ob&s;erved above, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive re|gulations. Land-property continued a much &s;horter time in this un&s;table condition. Of all &s;ubjects of property, land is that which engages our affection the mo&s;t; and for this rea&s;on the relation of property, re&s;pecting land, grew up much &s;ooner to its pre&s;ent firmne&s;s and &s;tability, than the relation of property re&s;pecting moveables. For many centuries pa&s;t, it is believed, that in no civi|lized
<PB N="148" REF="159">
nation, has <HI>bona fides</HI> alone been held to &s;ecure the purcha&s;er of land. Where the vender is not proprietor, it is requi&s;ite that the purcha&s;e be followed with a long and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is extreme probable, that the &s;trong <HI>nexus</HI> of land-property, which cannot be loo&s;ed otherwi&s;e than by con&s;ent, had an influence upon moveable property, to make it equally &s;table. But if land-property led the way in this particular, moveable pro|perty undoubtedly led the way in what we are now to enter upon, <HI>viz.</HI> the power of aliening. The connection of per&s;ons with moveables is more immediate than with land. A moveable may be locked up in a repo&s;itory. Cattle are killed every day for the &s;u&s;tenance of the proprietor and his fa|mily. From this power, the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y to that of alienation; for what doubt can there be of my power to alien what I can de&s;troy? The right or power of aliena|tion mu&s;t therefore have been early recog|nized
<PB N="149" REF="160">
as a quality of moveable property. The power of di&s;po&s;ing moveables by will, to take effect after death, is a greater &s;tretch; and we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ee, that this power was not early acknowledged as one of the qualities even of moveable-property. We have rea&s;on, before-hand, to conjecture, that a power of aliening land, whether to take effect in&s;tantly, or after death, was not early introduced; becau&s;e land admits not, like moveables, a ready delivery from hand to hand. And this conjecture will be veri|fied in the following part of our hi&s;tory. Land, at the &s;ame time, is a de&s;ireable object; and a power to alien, after it came to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in moveable proper|ty, could not long be &s;eparated from the property of land.</P>
<P>BUT before we proceed farther in this hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t take a view of the forms and &s;olemnities which, in the common ap|prehen&s;ion of mankind, are requi&s;ite, fir&s;t to acquire, and then to transfer land-property.
<PB N="150" REF="161">
For the&s;e, if I mi&s;take not, will &s;upport the foregoing ob&s;ervations. It is taught by all writers, that occupation is an e&s;&s;ential &s;olem|nity in the original e&s;tabli&s;hment of land-property. The rea&s;on will be evident from what is &s;aid above, that property originally was not &s;eparated from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And the &s;ame &s;olemnity is requi&s;ite at this day with re&s;pect to every uninhabited country: for where there is no proprietor to alien, there can be no means other than occupation to form the connection of property, whether with land or with moveables. Occupation was equally nece&s;&s;ary in old times to com|pleat the transference of land-property. For if property was not under&s;tood to have an exi&s;tence without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, occupation behoved to be nece&s;&s;ary for transferring the property of land, as well as for e&s;tabli&s;hing it originally. But &s;o &s;oon as property came to be con&s;idered as a right independent of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was natural to relax from the &s;olemnities formerly requi&s;ite to transfer land-property. It is often difficult, and al|ways
<PB N="151" REF="162">
trouble&s;ome, to introduce a purcha&s;er with his family and goods into the natural po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and this &s;olemnity therefore was di&s;pen&s;ed with, becau&s;e not e&s;&s;ential upon the later &s;y&s;tem of property. But then, in oppo&s;ition to a practice &s;o long e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, the innovation would have been too violent, to a&s;cribe to the bare will of the former proprietor, the efficacy of transfer|ring the property to a purcha&s;er, without any &s;ort of &s;olemnity in place of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Such is our attachment to &s;en&s;ible objects, that it would have appeared like magic, or the tricks of a juggler, to make the proper|ty of land jump from one per&s;on to another, merely upon pronouncing certain words ex|pre&s;&s;ing will or con&s;ent. Words are often ambiguous, and always too tran&s;itory to take fa&s;t hold of the mind, without conco|mitant circum&s;tances. In place therefore of actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ome ouvert act was held nece&s;&s;ary in order to compleat the tran&s;mi&s;|&s;ion. This act, of whatever nature it be, is conceived as repre&s;enting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or as a
<PB N="152" REF="163">
&s;ymbol of it: and hence it has acquired the name of &s;ymbolical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. When this form fir&s;t crept in, &s;ome act was cho&s;en to repre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as di&s;tinctly as po&s;&s;ible; witne&s;s the ca&s;e mentioned by Selden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Janus Anglorum, Cap. 25.</NOTE>, where a grant of land made to the church, <HI>anno</HI> 687, was perfected, by laying a turf of the land upon the altar. This innovation was attempted with the greate&s;t caution; but after the form became cu&s;tomary, there was le&s;s nicety in the choice. The delivery of a &s;pear, of a helmet, or of a bunch of arrows, compleated the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, any &s;ymbol was taken, however little connected with the land: it was &s;ufficient that it was connected with the will of the granter. In the cathedral of York there is, to this day, pre&s;erved, a horn, delivered by Ulphus king of Deira to the mona&s;try of York, as a &s;ymbol for compleating a grant of land in their favours<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">IT is a common practice among the &s;almon-fi&s;hers to purloin from their ma&s;ters part of the fi&s;h; and it is very difficult to re&s;train them, becau&s;e they &s;carce think it a fault. They cannot conceive that the &s;almon, before delivery, be|long to their ma&s;ter. After delivery indeed, or after the ma|&s;ter's mark is put upon the fi&s;h, they readily admit, that it would be theft to take any away.

A &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, with which I &s;hall conclude this branch of our &s;ubject, may &s;erve to give us a more enlarged view of it. It appears to me, that there is a &s;tricter analogy betwixt creating per&s;onal obliga|tions and transferring land-property, than is commonly imagined. Words merely, make no great impre&s;&s;ion upon the rude and illiterate.

come to be more refined, and &s;ub&s;tance regarded more than form, it is probable, that external &s;ymbols, which have long been laid a&s;ide in per&s;onal rights, will al&s;o be laid a&s;ide in rights affecting land. We return to our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>PROPERTY, as originally limited, be|&s;towing no power of alienation, carries the mind naturally to the children of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or, who continue the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion after his death, and who mu&s;t &s;ucceed if he cannot alien<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HEREDES tamen &s;ucce&s;&s;ore&s;que &s;ui cuique liberi: et nullum te&s;tamentum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacitus de morbus Germanorum.</NOTE>.</NOTE>. Their right, being independent of his will, was conceived a &s;ort of property. They make part of the family, live upon the land; and, in common with their parents, enjoy the product of the land.

<P>To tho&s;e who are ignorant of the hi&s;tory of law, and in their notions are riveted to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, the right here attributed to children may appear chimeri|cal. But it will have a very different ap|pearance, after mentioning a few of the many ancient cu&s;toms and regulations founded up|on it. And, to pave the way, I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;how, that the notions of the ancients about this matter were preci&s;ely as here &s;tated; for which I appeal to a learned Roman lawyer, Paulus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I. 11. de liber. &amp; po&s;thum. hered.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In &s;uis heredibus evidentius apparet, continuationem dominii eo rem perducere ut nulla videatur hereditas fui&s;&s;e, qua&s;i olim hi domini e&s;&s;ent, qui etiam vivo patre quodam modo do|mini exi&s;timantur.

But to proceed, it plainly aro&s;e from this right, that, among the Romans, children got the appellation of <HI>&s;ui et nece&s;|&s;arii heredes.</HI> The &s;trict connection betwixt parents and children produced the fir&s;t term; and the other aro&s;e from the &s;ingularity of their condition, that the heritage becoming theirs <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> by the father's death, they were heirs nece&s;&s;arily, without liberty of choice. Nor did this &s;ubject them to any ri&s;k, be|cau&s;e,
<PB N="157" REF="168">
deriving no right from their father, they were not bound to fulfil his deeds. In general, while property &s;ub&s;i&s;ted without power of aliening, no deed done by the fa|ther, whether civil or criminal, could affect the children. And as to crimes, &s;ome good authorities are &s;till extant. It was a law of Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, That children born or begot before commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, which infers forfeiture of goods, &s;hall not lo&s;e their inheritance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lambard's collection of old Engli&s;h laws, Edw. the Con|fe&s;&s;or, lex 19. at the end.</NOTE>.

Other regulations, acknowledging this right in children, and authori&s;ing parti|cular exceptions from it, will come in more properly, after proceeding a little farther in our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IT is remarked above, that the enlarged notion of property, by annexing to it a power of alienation, obtained fir&s;t in move|ables;
<PB N="158" REF="169">
and indeed &s;ociety could &s;carce &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without &s;uch a power; at lea&s;t &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for exchanging commodities, and carrying on commerce. But the &s;ame power was not early annexed to the property of land, unle&s;s perhaps to &s;upport the aliena|tion of &s;ome &s;mall part for value. This we certainly know, that a proprietor of land, which had de&s;cended to him from his an|ce&s;tors, could not di&s;po&s;e upon it totally, even for a valuable con&s;ideration, unle&s;s he was reduced to want of bread; and even in that ca&s;e, he was obliged to make the fir&s;t offer to his heir.

<P>DONATIONS, or gratuitous alienations, were of a &s;lower growth. The&s;e were at fir&s;t &s;mall, and upon plau&s;ible pretexts.

<P>DONATIONS <HI>inter vivos,</HI> paved the way to donations <HI>mortis cau&s;a.</HI> But this was a wide &s;tep, which behoved to require the au|thority of a law; for it was hard to con|ceive that the will of any man &s;hould, after his death and after his own right was at an end, have &s;o &s;trong an effect, as to prefer any per&s;on to the lawful heir. The power of te&s;ting was introduced among the Athe|nians by a law of Solon, giving power to every proprietor who had no children, to regulate his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by te&s;tament. Plu|tarch,

Alienations <HI>inter vivos</HI> had been long in practice; and it was but one &s;tep farther to annex to property a power of alienating <HI>mortis cau&s;a.</HI> Athens was ripe for this law; and hence it was natural for Plutarch to ob&s;erve, that the power of te&s;t|ing made every man proprietor of his own goods. The Decemviri at Rome, transferred this law into their Twelve Tables in the fol|lowing words. <HI>Pater-familias uti lega&s;&s;it &s;uper familiae, pecuniae, tutelaeve &s;uae rei, ita jus e&s;to.</HI> This law, though conceived in words unli|mited, was certainly not intended, more than
<PB N="163" REF="174">
Solon's law, to deprive children of their birth-right, which, in that early period, was too firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, to be &s;ubjected to the arbitrary will of the father; and if their in|tere&s;t in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had not been greater than that of other heirs, they would not have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of <HI>&s;ui et nece&s;&s;arii heredes.</HI> Further, that a|mong the Romans, the power of te&s;ting did not originally affect the heirs who are the i&s;&s;ue of the te&s;tator's own body, mu&s;t be evident from the following circum&s;tance, that even after the law of the Twelve Tables, no man had a power to exheredate his own i&s;&s;ue, unle&s;s in the te&s;tament he could &s;pe|cify a ju&s;t cau&s;e, ingratitude for example, rendering them unworthy of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. And the <HI>querela inofficio&s;i te&s;tamenti</HI> was an action introduced in favour of children, for re&s;cinding te&s;taments made in their preju|dice, in which no cau&s;e of exheredation was a&s;&s;igned, or an unju&s;t cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned. It is true, that a man was afterwards indulged to di&s;inherit his children without a cau&s;e, pro|vided
<PB N="164" REF="175">
he bequeathed to them the fourth part of what they would have inherited <HI>ab inte&s;|tato</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 8. &sect; 6. de inoff. te&s;t.</NOTE>. But Ju&s;tinian<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Novel. 115. cap 3.</NOTE> re&s;tored the old law, declaring, That without a ju&s;t cau&s;e of ex|heredation, &s;pecified in the te&s;tament, the <HI>querela</HI> &s;hall be competent, notwith&s;tanding his leaving the &s;aid fourth part to his &s;on and heir. And this regulation was adopted by the Longobards<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 2. Tit. 14. &sect; 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though the <HI>&s;ui et nece&s;&s;arii heredes</HI> could not be directly exheredated, it was in the father's power, not only by alienations <HI>inter vivos,</HI> but even by contracting debt, to render the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion unprofitable. So &s;oon as the power of aliening becomes a branch of property, every &s;ubject belonging to a debtor, land or moveables, mu&s;t lie open to be attached by his creditors. It is his duty to convert into money, the readie&s;t of his &s;ubjects for their payment, and if he prove refractory, by refu&s;ing to do what in
<PB N="165" REF="176">
con&s;cience is incumbent upon him, the law will interpo&s;e. Ju&s;tice be&s;tows this privi|lege upon creditors during their debtor's life; and con&s;equently al&s;o after his death; it be|ing incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice that the heir &s;hould profit by their lo&s;s. This new cir|cum&s;tance introduced nece&s;&s;arily an altera|tion of the law as to the <HI>&s;ui et nece&s;&s;arii he|redes:</HI> for now they could no longer be held as nece&s;&s;ary heirs, when their being heirs was no longer attended with &s;afety, but might prove ruinous in&s;tead of beneficial. The &s;ame rule of ju&s;tice which prevailed in the former ca&s;e, prevailed al&s;o in this, and conferred upon them the privilege of aban|doning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in which ca&s;e their father's debts did not reach them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">l. 12. de acquir. vel omit. hered.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may appear &s;ingular, that while chil|dren were thus gradually lo&s;ing ground, col|lateral heirs, who originally had no privi|lege, were in many countries gaining ground. I &s;hall fir&s;t &s;tate the facts, and afterwards en|deavour
<PB N="166" REF="177">
to a&s;&s;ign the cau&s;e. Several na|tions followed the Grecian plan, indulging an unlimited power of te&s;ting, where the te&s;tator had not i&s;&s;ue of his own body. Thus, by the Ripuarian law, a man who had no children might di&s;po&s;e of his effects as he thought proper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lex Ripuariorum, &sect; 48.</NOTE>; and among the Vi&s;igoths, the man who had no de&s;cendants might do the &s;ame<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lex Vi&s;igothorum, L. 4. Tit. 2. &sect; 20.</NOTE>. But this privilege was more limited among other nations. The power of making a te&s;tament, be&s;towed at large by the Roman law, failing children, was afterwards confined within narrower bounds. The privilege which children and other de&s;cendants had, to re&s;cind a te&s;ta|ment exheredating them without ju&s;t cau&s;e, &s;pread it&s;elf upon other near relations; and the&s;e therefore might in&s;i&s;t in a <HI>querela inof|ficio&s;i,</HI> which originally was competent to de&s;cendants only<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 1. de inoff. te&s;t.</NOTE>. By the laws of the German Saxons, it was not lawful to di&s;|inherit the heir<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Laws of the Saxons, &sect; 14.</NOTE>. And by the laws of king
<PB N="167" REF="178">
Alfred, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He who inherits lands derived from his ance&s;tors by writ, &s;hall not have power to alien the &s;ame from his heirs, e&s;pecially if it be proved by writing or witne&s;&s;es, that the per&s;on who made the grant di&s;charged &s;uch alienation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lambard's collection.

<P>To &s;et this matter in its proper light, I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that originally there was not &s;uch a thing as a right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in the &s;en&s;e we now give to that term. Children came in place of their parents: but this was not properly a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; it was a conti|nuation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, founded upon their own title of property. And while the re|lation of property continued &s;o &s;light as it
<PB N="168" REF="179">
was originally, it was perhaps thought &s;uf|ficient, that children <HI>in familia</HI> only, &s;hould enjoy this privilege. Hence when a man died without children, the land he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed fell back to the common, ready for the fir&s;t occupant. But the connection betwixt a man and the land upon which he dwells, having, in cour&s;e of time, acquired great &s;tability, is now imagined to &s;ub&s;i&s;t even after death. This conception pre&s;erves the &s;ubject as in a &s;tate of appropriation, and con&s;equently bars every per&s;on except tho&s;e who derive right from the decea&s;ed. By this means, the right of inheriting the fa|mily-e&s;tate was probably communicated fir&s;t to children <HI>foris familiate,</HI> e&s;pecially if all the children were in that &s;ituation; there|after, failing children, to brothers, and &s;o gradually to more di&s;tant relations. We have to this day traces remaining of the gradual progre&s;s. In the laws of the Lon|gobards, collaterals &s;ucceeded to the &s;eventh degree<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 2. Tit. 14. &sect; 1.</NOTE>. Our countryman Craig<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 2. Dieg. 17.</NOTE> relat|eth
<PB N="169" REF="180">
it as the opinion of &s;ome, That if there be no heirs within the &s;eventh degree, the King hath right as <HI>ultimus heres.</HI> He in|deed &s;ignifies his own opinion to the con|trary; and now it is e&s;tabli&s;hed, That rela|tions &s;ucceed, however di&s;tant, provided only they give evidence of their propin|quity.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of collaterals, failing de|&s;cendants, produced a new legal idea; for as they had no pretext of right, indepen|dent of the former proprietor, their pri|vilege of &s;ucceeding could &s;tand upon no other ground than the pre&s;umed will of the decea&s;ed, which made them heirs, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, &s;ucceding to the right of the decea&s;ed, and enjoying his land by his will. This makes a &s;olid difference betwixt the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of collaterals, depend|ing on the will of the ance&s;tor, and the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of de&s;cendants, which originally did not depend on his will. But the privilege of de&s;cendants, being gradually re&s;trained
<PB N="170" REF="181">
within narrower and narrower bounds, was confounded with the hope of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion in collaterals. They were put upon the &s;ame footing, and con&s;idered equally as re|pre&s;entatives of the per&s;on in who&s;e place they came. This deduction appears natu|ral; and what I have farther to ob&s;erve appears not le&s;s &s;o, That de&s;cendants and collaterals being thus blended into one cla&s;s, the privileges of the former were commu|nicated to the latter.</P>
<P>BUT the privileges thus acquired by col|laterals were not of long continuance. The powers annexed to property being carried to their utmo&s;t bounds, it came, in mo&s;t coun|tries which did not adhere to the Roman law, to be con&s;idered as an inherent power in pro|prietors, to &s;ettle their e&s;tates at their plea|&s;ure, without regard to their natural heirs, de&s;cendants or collaterals. In this i&s;land the power of di&s;po&s;al became unlimited, even to take effect after death, provided the deed were in the form of an alienation <HI>inter</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="182">
<HI>vivos.</HI> The property which children once had in the family-e&s;tate was no longer in force, except as to one particular, that of baring deeds on death-bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WHILE the law &s;tood, as it did originally, That no man could di&s;po&s;e of his e&s;tate in prejudice of his heir, there could not be place for the law of death-bed. This law was the con&s;equence of indulging proprietors to di&s;po&s;e of a part for rational con&s;iderations; from which indulgence death-bed was an exception. Hence it appears, that the law of death-bed was not a new regulation introduced into Scotland by &s;tatute or cu&s;tom. It is in reality a branch of the origi|nal law, confining proprietors from aliening their lands in prejudice of their heirs, which original law is &s;till pre&s;erved entire in the circum&s;tance of death-bed. Our authors there|fore are in a mi&s;take, when they a&s;cribe the law of death-bed to the wi&s;dom of our forefathers, in order to protect their e&s;tates from the rapacity of the clergy. It exi&s;ted too early among us to make this a probable &s;uppo&s;ition. In tho&s;e early times, the prevalence of &s;uper&s;tition would have pre|vented &s;uch a regulation, had a po&s;itive law been nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE>. And this, with other privileges of de&s;cendants, was communicated to collateral heirs<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Glanvil, L. 7. Cap. 1. Reg. Maj. L. 2. Cap. 18.</NOTE>. In England the powers of proprietors were &s;o far extended by a law of Henry VIII.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 Hen. VIII. Cap. 5. &sect; 4.</NOTE>. as to entitle them, without the formality of a deed of alienation, to &s;ettle or di&s;po&s;e of
<PB N="172" REF="183">
their lands by te&s;tament; after which, deeds on death-bed could no longer be re&s;trained. In Scotland the law of death-bed &s;ub&s;i&s;ts entire, as well as the limitation upon pro|prietors, that they cannot di&s;po&s;e of their heretable &s;ubjects by te&s;tament. The for|mer is no longer con&s;idered as a limitation of the powers of property, but as a per&s;onal privilege belonging to heirs; for which rea|&s;on a deed on death-bed is not void for want of power: it is an effectual grant till it be voided by the heir upon his privilege. But the latter is plainly a limitation of the powers of property; which &s;hews, that in this coun|try property is not &s;o compleat as el&s;ewhere. By the old law, a donation had no effect without delivery. For &s;uppo&s;ing the deed to have contained warrandice, yet this war|randice was not effectual again&s;t the heir, who was not bound to pay his father's debts, or fulfil his engagements. Heirs, it is true, are now liable; but then a te&s;tament con|tains no warrandice: and therefore an here|table &s;ubject legated by te&s;tament is con&s;i|dered,
<PB N="173" REF="184">
as of old, an incompleat donation, which the heir is not bound to make effec|tual. But though we admit not of the alien|ation of an heretable &s;ubject by te&s;tament, alienation is &s;u&s;tained in a form very little different. A di&s;po&s;ition of land, though a mere donation, implies warrandice; and therefore, &s;uch a deed found in the granter's repo&s;itory after his death, &s;uppo&s;ing it to contain neither procuratory nor precept, will be effectual again&s;t his heir. And the dif|ference betwixt this deed and a te&s;tament, in point of form, is &s;o &s;light, that it is not to be comprehended, except by tho&s;e who are daily conver&s;ant in the forms and &s;o|lemnities of law.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, by the law of Scotland, en|joy another privilege, which is a certain por|tion of the father's moveable e&s;tate. Of this he cannot deprive them by will, or by any deed which takes effect after his death only. This privilege, like that of death|bed, is obviou&s;ly a branch of the original
<PB N="174" REF="185">
law, being founded upon the nature of pro|perty as originally limited. The power over land is in Scotland not &s;o far extended, as that an incompleat donation will be ef|fectual again&s;t the heir, when executed in the form of a te&s;tament. The power over moveables is &s;o far extended, as that they can be gifted by te&s;tament; but yet not &s;o as to affect the intere&s;t which the children have in the moveables. And there is the fol|lowing analogy betwixt the right of the heir concerning heritage, and that of children concerning moveables, that both have been converted from rights of property to per&s;o|nal privileges; with this difference only, that the privilege of a child, heir in the land-e&s;tate, to bar the father's death-bed deed, is communicated to other heirs; whereas the privilege of children, re&s;pecting the move|able e&s;tate, is communicated to de&s;cendants only, and not to collaterals.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the foregoing privilege of chil|dren over the moveable e&s;tate of their father,
<PB N="175" REF="186">
one thing mu&s;t appear whim&s;ical, that the power of aliening moveables &s;hould be more limited than that of aliening land. For as a moveable &s;ubject is more under the natural power of man than land, &s;o the legal powers of moveable property were brought to perfec|tion more early than of land-property. Were I to indulge a conjecture, in order to account for this whim&s;ical branch of our law, it would be what follows: The privilege of children re&s;pecting the moveable e&s;tate was pre&s;erved entire, becau&s;e it was all along confined to children; but their privilege re&s;pecting the real e&s;tate having been communicated to collaterals, which put all heirs upon the &s;ame level, the character of child was lo&s;t in that of heir, and their common privileges &s;unk together. Thus, though collaterals have profited by being blended in one cla&s;s with de&s;cendants, the latter have been lo&s;ers by the union.</P>

One who&s;e notions are derived from the pre&s;ent condition of land-property mu&s;t be extremely puzzled about this memorable event: for where is the man to be found, who will peaceably &s;urrender his land to the publick without a valuable con&s;ideration? And if &s;uch a man could be found for a wonder, it would be downright madne&s;s to expect the &s;ame from a whole people. And yet in &s;ettling this branch of publick police, &s;o &s;ingular in its nature, we read not even of the &s;lighte&s;t tumult or commotion. The &s;tory always appeared to me incredible, till I &s;tumbled upon the train of thinking above mentioned. In ancient times, property of land was certainly not &s;o valuable a right as at pre&s;ent. It was no better than a right
<PB N="177" REF="188">
of u&s;ufruct, a power of u&s;ing the fruits for the &s;upport of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and his family. It is al&s;o true, That in ancient times the manner of living was more &s;imple than at pre&s;ent: men were &s;atisfied with the product of the land they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for their food and raiment. When the foregoing revolution was brought about in Sparta, it is probable, that permutation of commodities, and buy|ing and &s;elling were not far advanced. If &s;o, it was not refining much to think, that a family is not entitled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more land than is &s;ufficient for the conve|niency of living, e&s;pecially if any other fa|mily of the &s;ame tribe be in want. In this view of the matter, an equal di&s;tribution of land-property, and an agrarian law, might not be &s;o difficult an undertaking as a per|&s;on accu&s;tomed to the pre&s;ent &s;cene of af|fairs will be apt to imagine.</P>
<P>THE next epi&s;ode relates to the feudal law. Though, by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, the property remains with the &s;uperior, the right
<PB N="178" REF="189">
given to the va&s;&s;al being only an u&s;u|fruct; yet, it appears, that both in England and Scotland the va&s;&s;al was early under&s;tood to be proprietor. He could alien his land to be held of him&s;elf, and the alienation was effectual to bar the &s;uperior even from his ca&s;ualties of ward, marriage, e&s;cheat, &amp;c. This was not &s;olely a vulgar way of think|ing; it was deemed to be law by the legi&s;|lature it&s;elf; witne&s;s the Engli&s;h &s;tatute, commonly called, <HI>Quia emptores terrarum,</HI> 18. Edw. I. cap. 1. and 2. Statutes Rob. I. cap. 25. It may appear not ea&s;y to be ex|plained, how a notion &s;hould have gained ground that is &s;o repugnant to the mo&s;t ob|vious principles of law. For it might occur, even at fir&s;t view, that, the property remain|ing with the &s;uperior, he mu&s;t be entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land, and levy the rents upon all occa&s;ions, except where he is excluded by his own deed. And as in every military feu, the &s;uperior is entitled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, both while there is no va&s;&s;al, and while the va&s;&s;al is young and unable to go to war, how
<PB N="179" REF="190">
could it be overlooked, that the ca&s;ualties of non-entry and ward, which are effectual again&s;t the va&s;&s;al, mu&s;t be equally effectual again&s;t every one who comes in his place? I cannot account for this otherwi&s;e, than by ob&s;erving, that property originally dif|fered nothing from a right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which gave the enjoyment of the fruits; and therefore, that every man who was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and who had the enjoyment of the fruits, was readily conceived to be pro|prietor. This was the ca&s;e of the va&s;&s;al; and accordingly, when the power of aliena|tion came to be con&s;idered as an inherent branch of property, it was thought, That a grant made by the va&s;&s;al of part of the land, or even of the whole, to be held of him&s;elf, mu&s;t be effectual.</P>
<P>ONE epi&s;ode more before we return to the principal &s;ubject. So great anxiety in the Roman legi&s;lature, to re&s;train proprie|tors from doing inju&s;tice to their own chil|dren, has a very odd appearance. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Chil|dren
<PB N="180" REF="191">
are not to be exheredated without a ju&s;t cau&s;e, chiefly that of ingratitude. The cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;et forth in the te&s;ta|ment. It mu&s;t be tried before the judge, and verified by witne&s;&s;es, if denied."</Q> A|mong other nations, natural affection, with|out the aid of law, is a &s;ufficient motive with parents to do full ju&s;tice to their chil|dren. Shall we admit, that natural affec|tion was at a lower ebb among the Romans than among other people? It &s;eems &s;o; and the forgoing regulations are real evidence of the fact. The Romans however, in the more early periods of their hi&s;tory, were a brave and gallant people, fond of their coun|try, and con&s;equently, one &s;hould think, of their children; whence then &s;hould proceed this want of parental affection? I do not &s;up|po&s;e they were left unprovided by nature: but laws and cu&s;toms have a &s;trong influence to produce manners contrary to nature. Let us examine the <HI>patria pote&s;tas,</HI> as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Roman law; for it may po&s;&s;ibly fur|ni&s;h a hint. By the law of nature, the
<PB N="181" REF="192">
<HI>patria pote&s;tas</HI> is be&s;towed upon the father for the &s;ake of the child, and when &s;teadily exerci&s;ed for that end, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce in time a reciprocal affection, the &s;tronge&s;t our nature is capable of. Na|ture lays the foundation: continual atten|tion on the one hand, to promote the good of a beloved object; and on the other, continual returns of gratitude augment daily mutual affection, till the mind be incapable of any addition. If in any in&s;tance the event be different, it mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by a wrong application of the <HI>patria pote&s;tas,</HI> or by an extreme perver&s;e di&s;po&s;ition in the child. But was the <HI>patria pote&s;tas</HI> among the Romans e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the plan of nature? Quite the contrary. It was the power of a tyrant over &s;laves. A man could put his children to death. He could &s;ell them for a price; and if they obtained their liberty by good luck, or good behaviour, he could &s;ell them a &s;econd, and a third time. The&s;e unnatural powers were perhaps not often put in exerci&s;e; but it is enough that
<PB N="182" REF="193">
they were lawful. This very circum&s;tance is &s;ufficient to produce &s;everity in parents, and fear and diffidence in children. There is not like to be, in this ca&s;e, much more harmony than in pure de&s;poti&s;m betwixt the awful monarch and his trembling &s;laves. In &s;hort, the Roman <HI>patriae pote&s;tas,</HI> and the legal re&s;traint proprietors were laid un|der, not to hurt their own children, &s;erve to illu&s;trate each other. There could be no univer&s;al cordiality where &s;uch re&s;traints were nece&s;&s;ary. We have rea&s;on beforehand to conjecture, that the <HI>patria pote&s;tas</HI> be|hoved to have &s;ome &s;uch effect; and we have rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with our conjec|ture, when we find it ju&s;tified by &s;ub&s;tantial facts.</P>
<P>PUTTING now an end to epi&s;odical a|mu&s;ements, we proceed with new vigour in our hi&s;torical cour&s;e. It was interrupted at that part, where, with a very few excep|tions, the powers of a proprietor were ex|tended, one &s;hould think, their utmo&s;t
<PB N="183" REF="194">
length. Every man had the full enjoyment of his own &s;ubject while it remained with him. He might di&s;po&s;e of it for a valuable con&s;ideration, without any re&s;traint. He might do the &s;ame for love and favour; and his power reached even &s;o far, as to direct what per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hould have the en|joyment of it after his death. Would any moderate man covet more power over &s;uch of the goods of fortune as fall to his &s;hare? No moderate man, it is certain, will covet more. But the number is not &s;mall of tho&s;e who&s;e thir&s;t after power is never to be quenched. They wi&s;h to combine their name, family, and e&s;tate in the &s;tricte&s;t u|nion, and, leaving nothing to the di&s;po&s;al of providence, they wi&s;h to prolong this union, if po&s;&s;ible, to the end of time. Such am|bitious views, ill &s;uiting the frail condition of humanity, have produced entails in this i&s;land; and would have done &s;o in old Rome, had &s;uch &s;ettlements been found con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of property.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="195">
BEING arrived at entails in our hi&s;torical cour&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cu&s;s a pre|liminary que&s;tion, Whether and how far they are con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of pro|perty? In order to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, &s;ome principles of law mu&s;t be premi&s;ed. The fir&s;t re&s;pects every &s;ubject capable of proper|ty, that the whole powers of property, whe|ther united in one per&s;on, or di&s;tributed a|mong a plurality, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t entire &s;ome|where; and that none of them can be &s;unk or annihilated &s;o as to be beneficial to no per&s;on. The rea&s;on will be obvious when we con&s;ider, that the goods of fortune are intended for the u&s;e of man; and that it is contrary to their nature to be withdrawn from u&s;e in whole or in part. A man, if he plea&s;e, may abandon his &s;ubject; but then no will nor purpo&s;e of his can bar others, or prevent the right of the fir&s;t occupant. No law, natural or municipal, gives &s;uch ef|fect to the will of any man. Therefore if I &s;hall dive&s;t my&s;elf of any moveable &s;ubject, be&s;towing it upon my friend, but declaring,
<PB N="185" REF="196">
that though he him&s;elf may enjoy the &s;ub|ject, he &s;hall have no power of di&s;po&s;al, &s;uch a deed will not be effectual in law. If I am totally dive&s;ted, he mu&s;t be totally inve&s;ted; and con&s;equently mu&s;t have the power of alienation. The &s;ame mu&s;t hold in a di&s;|po&s;ition of land. If the granter re&s;erve no right to him&s;elf, the entire property mu&s;t be tran&s;ferred to the di&s;ponee, however ex|pre&s;s the granter's will may be to confine the di&s;ponee's property within narrower bounds.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Though none of the powers of property can be annihilated by will or con|&s;ent, a proprietor however may, by will or con&s;ent, limit him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e of his property, for the benefit of others. Such limitations are effectual in law, and are at the &s;ame time perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute property. If a man be put in chains, or &s;hut up in a dungeon, his property, in a legal &s;en&s;e, is as entire as ever; though at pre&s;ent he is deprived of the u&s;e or enjoyment of the
<PB N="186" REF="197">
&s;ubjects which belong to him. In like man|ner, a civil obligation may re&s;train a pro|prietor from the free u&s;e of his own &s;ubject: but &s;uch re&s;traint limits not his right to the &s;ubject, more than re&s;traint by walls or chains.</P>
<P>A THIRD principle will bring the pre&s;ent &s;ubject fully within view. A practice was derived from Greece to Rome, of adopting a &s;on, when a man had not i&s;&s;ue of his own body. This was done in a &s;olemn manner before the <HI>Calata Comitia,</HI> who in Rome po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the legi&s;lative authority. The adopted &s;on had all the privileges of one born in law|ful wedlock: he had the &s;ame intere&s;t in the family-e&s;tate, the &s;ame right to continue the father's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to have the full en|joyment of the &s;ubject. A te&s;tament, when authori&s;ed by the law of the Twelve Tables, received its form from this practice. A te|&s;tament was under&s;tood to be only a diffe|rent form of adopting a &s;on, which be&s;towed the &s;ame privilege of &s;ucceeding to the fa|mily-e&s;tate,
<PB N="187" REF="198">
after the te&s;tator's death, that belonged to the heir who was adopted in the more &s;olemn manner in the <HI>Calata Co|mitia.</HI> A te&s;tament is in Britain a <HI>donatio mortis cau&s;a;</HI> an alienation to take effect af|ter death; and the legatee does not &s;ucceed as heir, but takes as purcha&s;er, in the &s;ame manner as if a formal donation were made in his favour, to have a pre&s;ent effect. In Rome, as ju&s;t now hinted, a te&s;tament was of a different nature. It was not a convey|ance of land or goods from one per&s;on to another; it entirely con&s;i&s;ted in the nomi|nation of an heir, who, in this character, en|joyed the te&s;tator's effects. The per&s;on nam|ed took the heritage as heir, not as purcha&s;er. This explains a maxim in the Roman law, widely differing from our notions, That a man cannot die <HI>pro parte te&s;tatus et pro parte inte&s;tatus;</HI> and that if in a te&s;tament one be named heir, and limited to a particular &s;ub|ject, he notwith&s;tanding is of nece&s;&s;ity heir to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="199">
THE privilege of adoption was never known in Britain; nor have we any form of a writ &s;imilar to a Roman te&s;tament, which a man could u&s;e, if he were di&s;po&s;ed to exclude his natural heir, and to name another in his place. Te&s;taments we had early; but not in the form of a nomination of heirs. This writ is a &s;pecies of aliena|tion, whether we con&s;ider moveables, which is its &s;ole province in Scotland, or land, to which in England it was extended by the above mentioned &s;tatute of Henry VIII. Therefore, by the common law of this land, there is no method for &s;etting a&s;ide the na|tural heirs, otherways than by an alienation of the e&s;tate <HI>inter vivos</HI> or <HI>mortis cau&s;a.</HI> Nor in this ca&s;e does the di&s;ponee take as heir; he takes as purcha&s;er, and the natural heirs are not otherwi&s;e excluded, than by making the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion unprofitable to them. This may &s;erve to explain a maxim in our old law, which, to tho&s;e educated in the Roman notions, mu&s;t appear ob&s;cure, if not unintelligible. The maxim is, That
<PB N="189" REF="200">
GOD only can make an heir, not man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Glanvil, L. 7. cap. 1. Reg. Maj. L. 2. cap. 20. &sect; 4.</NOTE>. The Roman te&s;tament laid a foundation for a di&s;tinction among heirs. They were either <HI>heredes nati</HI> or <HI>heredes facti.</HI> Our common law acknowledges no &s;uch di&s;tinction: no man can have the character of an heir but an heir of blood.</P>
<P>WE are now, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently pre|pared to enter upon the intricate &s;ubject of entails. And to prevent the embara&s;&s;ment of too much matter on hand together, we &s;hall fir&s;t examine the power of &s;ub&s;tituting a &s;eries of heirs to each other, who are to take the heritage in their order, exclu&s;ive of the natural heirs; and then proceed to the limitations impo&s;ed upon heirs, which pre|vent alienation, whether direct, by di&s;pon|ing land, or indirect, by contracting debt. A maxim, which makes a figure in the Ro|man law, mu&s;t not be forgot, in explaining the fir&s;t point concerning the power of &s;ub|&s;titution. A Roman te&s;tator could name
<PB N="190" REF="201">
any per&s;on to be his heir, but he had not the power to name &s;ub&s;titutes: for thus &s;ays the maxim, NO MAN CAN NAME AN HEIR TO SUCCEED TO HIS HEIR. The rea|&s;on will appear when we reflect upon &s;ome particulars already explained. The heir, whether <HI>natus</HI> or <HI>factus,</HI> became unlimited proprietor &s;o &s;oon as the predece&s;&s;or was dead. The inheritance was now his, and entirely at his di&s;po&s;al. If he cho&s;e to make a te&s;tament, the heir named by him took place of the heir named by his predece&s;&s;or; and if he died <HI>inte&s;tate,</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open|ed to his own natural heirs. For it is the will of the proprietor which mu&s;t regulate his own &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and not the will of any other, not even of a predece&s;&s;or. This maxim then is not founded upon any pecu|liarity in the Roman law, but upon the very nature of property. While a &s;ubject is mine, it is entirely at my di&s;po&s;al; but after be&s;towing it upon another, without any re|&s;ervation, my power is at end; and my will, though expre&s;&s;ed while I was proprietor,
<PB N="191" REF="202">
cannot now have the effect to limit the power of the pre&s;ent proprietor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE coins of a Roman emperor had &s;carce any curren|cy after his death; and therefore the fir&s;t act of power gene|rally was to recoin the money of the former emperor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walker's Grecian and Roman hi&s;tory, illu&s;trated by medals, page 15.</NOTE>. It was the pre&s;ent emperor's will only which could give autho|rity to publick money, or to any other publick concern. This &s;erves to illu&s;trate the principle, That a man's will after his death cannot have the effect to regulate the conduct, or limit the property of the next &s;ucce&s;&s;or; particularly, that it cannot have the effect to limit the &s;ucce&s;&s;or with regard to the choice of his own heir.</NOTE>. An heir named in a Roman te&s;tament, might, it is true, be &s;ubjected per&s;onally to whatever burdens or obligations the te&s;tator thought proper to impo&s;e upon him: but we ought not, in this matter, to lo&s;e &s;ight of the dif|ference betwixt a real burden or limitation and a per&s;onal obligation. A man, by his own con&s;ent, may re&s;train him&s;elf from the u&s;e of his property; but the full property neverthele&s;s remains with him.</P>
<P>ONE exception to this rule was intro|duced from utility, <HI>viz.</HI> the pupillar &s;ub|&s;titution. A proprietor who had a &s;on
<PB N="192" REF="203">
under age to &s;ucceed him as his heir, was impowered to name a &s;ub&s;titute, who took the e&s;tate as heir to the &s;on, in ca&s;e the &s;on died &s;o early as to be him&s;elf incapable of making a te&s;tament. In all other ca&s;es, if a te&s;tator, after naming his heir, inclined to make a &s;ub&s;titution, he had no other me|thod, but to take the heir bound per&s;onally to make over the e&s;tate to the &s;ub&s;titute. This form of a &s;ettlement is known by the name of <HI>Fidei Commi&s;&s;um.</HI> And after the &s;ub&s;titute &s;ucceeded, by virtue of the <HI>fidei commi&s;&s;ary</HI> clau&s;e, there was an end of the entail.</P>
<P>THE forgoing maxim, That no man can regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his heir, holds in property only, not in inferior rights. If a proprietor grant a right burdening or limit|ing his property, and call to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion a certain &s;eries of heirs, it is clear, that neither the grantee, nor any of the heirs named, who accept the right in the&s;e terms, have power, without con&s;ent of the granter,
<PB N="193" REF="204">
or his heirs, to alter the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In the practice even of the Roman law, where the fore&s;aid maxim was inviolable, it was never doubted, that, in a perpetual lea&s;e, termed <HI>Empheten&s;is,</HI> or in any lea&s;e of long endurance, it is in the power of the granter to regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the le&s;&s;ee. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, in our feudal rights, a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the original grant, is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t principles of property. The order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion cannot be altered with|out con&s;ent of the &s;uperior; for it would be a breach of agreement, to force upon him as va&s;&s;al any per&s;on who is not called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by the original grant. And thus in Britain it came to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed prac|tice, by means of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, not that a man &s;ingly can name an heir to his heir, but that, with con&s;ent of the &s;uperior, he can &s;ub&s;titute heirs without end, to take the feudal &s;ubject &s;ucce&s;&s;ively one after another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ACCORDING to the original con&s;titution of feudal hold|ings, a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the&s;e &s;ubjects was e&s;tabli&s;hed on a foundation &s;till more clear and indi&s;putable. A feudal holding, while it was beneficiary and not patrimonial, admit|ted not, properly &s;peaking, of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs. When a va&s;&s;al died the &s;ubject returned to the &s;uperior, who made a new grant in favour of the heir called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the original grant; and &s;o on till all the heirs were exhau&s;ted to whom the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was originally limited; after which the &s;ubject returned &s;imply and ab&s;olutely to the &s;uperior. The title therefore of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion being a new grant from the &s;upe|rior, the per&s;ons called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion could not properly be con&s;idered as heirs but as purcha&s;ers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="205">
THE per&s;ons thus called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the feudal &s;ubject, are in Scotland under|&s;tood to be heirs, all of them, to the ori|ginal grantee, whether they be of his blood or not. This way of thinking is borrowed from the Roman law, in which every per&s;on is e&s;teemed an heir who is called by will to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He is at lea&s;t <HI>heres factus,</HI> according to their language, if not <HI>heres natus.</HI> In this we have deviated from our own common law, which acknowledges none to be an heir who is not of the predece&s;&s;or's blood.</P>
<P>IN England different notions have obtain|ed. The maxim, That GOD only can make
<PB N="195" REF="206">
an heir, not man, is not &s;o &s;trictly taken, as to exclude every per&s;on from the character of an heir, &s;ave the heir at law only. From the beginning nothing was more common in feudal grants, than to chu&s;e a certain &s;pecies of heirs, &s;uch as the male de&s;cendants of the original va&s;&s;al, or the heirs of a marriage. The&s;e are heirs in the &s;en&s;e of the Engli&s;h law, though they may happen not to be the heirs who would &s;ucceed by law. Hence every per&s;on who is called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion under a general de&s;cription, &s;uch as heirs of the granter's body, or male i&s;&s;ue, or heirs of a marriage, or male i&s;&s;ue of a marriage, is con&s;idered as an heir, in oppo&s;ition to a &s;tranger, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch per&s;on may not be the heir at law. The true &s;en&s;e of the maxim appears then to be as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> That no per&s;on can have the character of an heir who is not of the blood of the original va&s;&s;al: al&s;o that it is not &s;ufficient to be of the blood, unle&s;s he be al&s;o called under &s;ome general de&s;cription. Therefore, in England, when, in a deed of &s;ettlement
<PB N="196" REF="207">
of a land-e&s;tate, a &s;tranger or any man is by name called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he is un|der&s;tood to be called as a conditional in&s;ti|tute; preci&s;ely as if one grant were made to Sempronius and the heirs of his body, and another grant of the &s;ame &s;ubject to Titius and the heirs of his body, to take effect whenever the heirs of Sempronius &s;hould fail. Titius, in this ca&s;e, is not called in the quality of an heir to Sempro|nius: he is, as well as Sempronius, an in&s;ti|tute, or a di&s;ponee, with this only differ|ence, that the right of Sempronius is pure, and that of Titius conditional. This con|ditional right is, in England, termed a Re|mainder; and as a remainder-man is not con&s;idered to be an heir, he is not liable to fulfil any of the debts or deeds of the fir&s;t in&s;titute, or of his heirs; and when the&s;e heirs are exhau&s;ted, he takes, not by a &s;er|vice upon a brieve <HI>quod diem clau&s;it &s;upre|mum,</HI> but as purcha&s;er, by authority of the original grant.</P>

THUS it is, that the feudal law, by fur|ni&s;hing means for a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs, as in Scotland, or of heirs and remain|der-men, as in England, hath fo&s;tered the ambitious views of men to pre&s;erve their names, families and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in perpetual exi&s;tence. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, as originally con&s;tituted, was qualified to fulfil &s;uch views in every particular. It not only paved the way for a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but &s;ecured the heirs by preventing dilapidation. And this leads naturally to the &s;econd point pro|po&s;ed to be handled with re&s;pect to entails, <HI>viz.</HI> The limitations impo&s;ed upon heirs to prevent aliening or contracting debt. This followed from the very nature of the feudal &s;y&s;tem; for the va&s;&s;al's right, being a liferent or u&s;ufruct only, gave him no power of alien|ating the property which remained with the &s;uperior. The only unlucky circum|&s;tance for entails is, that during the vigour of the feudal law, con&s;tant wars and com|motions, a perpetual hurry in attacking or defending, afforded very little time for in|dulging
<PB N="198" REF="209">
the foregoing ambitious views. In times only of peace, &s;ecurity and plenty, do men dream of di&s;tant futurity, and of per|petuating their e&s;tates in their families. The feudal law lo&s;t ground univer&s;ally in times of peace. It was a violent and unnatural &s;y&s;tem, which could not be long &s;upported in contradiction to love of independency and property, the mo&s;t &s;teady and indu|&s;trious of all the human appetites. After a regular government was introduced in Bri|tain, which made the arts of peace prevail, all men equally con&s;pired to overthrow the feudal &s;y&s;tem. The va&s;&s;al was willing to purcha&s;e independency with his money; and the &s;uperior, who had no longer occa&s;ion for military tenants, di&s;po&s;ed of his land to bet|ter advantage. In this manner, land, which is the chief object of avarice, came again to be the chief &s;ubject of commerce: and that this was early the ca&s;e in Britain, we have undoubted evidence from the famous &s;ta|tute, <HI>Quia emptores terrarum,</HI> above men|tioned. By this time the &s;trict principles
<PB N="199" REF="210">
of the feudal law were vani&s;hed, and &s;carce any thing left but the figure only. Land, now re&s;tored to commerce, was, generally &s;peaking, in the hands of purcha&s;ers who had paid a valuable con&s;ideration; and con|&s;equently, in&s;tead of being beneficiary as for|merly, was now become patrimonial. The property being thus transferred from the &s;u|perior to the va&s;&s;al, the va&s;&s;al's power of alienation was a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence.</P>
<P>BUT men who had acquired great po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and who, in quiet times, found lei&s;ure to think of perpetuating their families, be|gun now to regret the never-cea&s;ing flux of land-property from hand to hand; and, revolving the hi&s;tory of former times, to wi&s;h for that &s;tability of land-property which the feudal law introduced, if it could be ob|tained without &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to the &s;lavi&s;h dependence of that law. In parti|cular, when a grant of land was made to a family, conditioned to return to the granter and his heirs when the family was at an end,
<PB N="200" REF="211">
it was thought hard, that the va&s;&s;al, con|trary to the condition of his right, could &s;ell the land, or di&s;po&s;e of it at his plea&s;ure, as if he had been a purcha&s;er for a full price. To fulfil the intention of tho&s;e, who after this manner &s;hould make voluntary &s;ettle|ments of land, the Engli&s;h, after the fetters of the feudal law were gone, found that a &s;tatute was nece&s;&s;ary; and to this end the &s;tatute <HI>de donis conditionalibus</HI> was made<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">13 Edw. I. cap. 1.</NOTE>. It proceeds upon the recital, 1&s;t, Of land given to a man and his wife, and their i&s;&s;ue, conditionally, that if they die without i&s;&s;ue, the land &s;hall revert to the giver and his heirs. 2dly, Of land given in free marriage, which implies a condition, though not ex|pre&s;&s;ed, that if the hu&s;band and wife die without i&s;&s;ue, the land &s;hall revert to the giver or his heirs. And, 3dly, Of land given to a man and the heirs of his body, condi|tionally, that it &s;hall, in like manner, revert, failing i&s;&s;ue. It &s;ub&s;umes that, contrary to the conditions expre&s;&s;ed or implied in &s;uch
<PB N="201" REF="212">
grants, the feofees had power to alien the land, to the di&s;appointment not only of the heirs, as to their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o of the donor, as to his right of rever&s;ion. Therefore it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the will of the donor &s;hall be from henceforth ob|&s;erved, &s;o that the donees &s;hall have no power to alien the land, but that it &s;hall remain to the i&s;&s;ue cho&s;en in the deed, and when they fail, &s;hall revert to the donor or his heirs."</Q> And thus in Eng|land, a privilege was, by &s;tatute, be&s;towed upon proprietors of land, to e&s;tabli&s;h perpe|tuities, by depriving the heirs of the power of aliening, which could not be done by the common law.</P>
<P>IN Scotland we had no &s;tatute authori&s;ing entails till the 1685, though before that time we had entails in plenty, many of which are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. It was the opinion of our lawyers; as it would appear, that by private authority an entail can be made &s;o as to bar alienation. To this end, clau&s;es prohibi|tory,
<PB N="202" REF="213">
irritant, and re&s;olutive, were contrived, which were reckoned effectual to pre&s;erve an entailed &s;ubject to the heirs in their order, and to void every deed prejudicial to the&s;e heirs. Whether this be a ju&s;t way of think|ing I proceed to examine.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve the &s;ubject-matter full in view, I take the liberty &s;hortly to recapi|tulate what is &s;aid above on this point. While the feudal law was in vigour there was no occa&s;ion for prohibitory clau&s;es: the va&s;&s;al's right being u&s;ufructuary only, in|volved not the power of alienation, nor of contracting debt &s;o as to be effectual again&s;t the heir of the inve&s;titure. But the feudal law is in England quite extirpated; nor doth it &s;ub&s;i&s;t in Scotland except merely as to the form of our title-deeds. Land with us has for &s;everal ages been con&s;idered as patrimo|nial. A va&s;&s;al has long enjoyed the power of contracting debt, and even of alien|ing <HI>mortis cau&s;a.</HI> To re&s;train him there|fore in any degree from the exerci&s;e of
<PB N="203" REF="214">
his property, can only be effectuated one of two ways; it mu&s;t be either by &s;tatute or by con&s;ent. The former requires no di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. It is evident, that the re&s;traints impo&s;ed by &s;tatute, of whatever nature, mu&s;t be effectual; becau&s;e every deed done in contempt of the law, is voidable, if not null and void. The latter requires a more particular examination, before we can form an accurate judgment of its effects. For the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, we &s;hall adapt our rea&s;oning to an entail made in the common form, with a long &s;eries of heirs, guarded only with a prohibitory clau&s;e, directed a|gain&s;t every one of the heirs of entail, in order to re&s;train them from aliening and from contracting debt. It is plain, that every &s;ingle heir, who accepts the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, is bound by this prohibition, &s;o far as he can be bound by his own con&s;ent. His very acceptance of the deed, vouched by his &s;erv|ing heir and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ubjects him, in common ju&s;tice, to the prohibition; for no man is permitted to take benefit of a
<PB N="204" REF="215">
deed without fulfilling the provi&s;ions and burdens impo&s;ed on him in the deed. Ad|mitting then, that the heir is bound by his acceptance, let us enquire, whether this con|&s;ent be effectual to fulfil the purpo&s;es of the entail. He &s;ells the e&s;tate notwith&s;tand|ing the prohibition; will not the purcha&s;er be &s;ecure, leaving to the heirs of entail an action again&s;t the vender for damages? This has been doubted, for the following rea&s;on, That a purcha&s;er who buys from an heir of entail, in whom it is a breach of duty to &s;ell, concurs thereby with his author in do|ing what is unju&s;t. But this argument ap|plies not again&s;t a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;er ig|norant of the re&s;traint; and therefore he mu&s;t be &s;ecure. Or, to put yet a &s;impler ca&s;e, let us &s;uppo&s;e the e&s;tate is adjudged for payment of debt. It is nece&s;&s;ity and not choice that makes a creditor proceed to legal execution; and even &s;uppo&s;ing him to be in the knowledge of the re&s;traint, there can be no inju&s;tice in his taking the benefit of the law to make his claim effectual. Hence it
<PB N="205" REF="216">
is plain, that a prohibition cannot alone have the effect to &s;ecure the e&s;tate again&s;t the debts and deeds of the tenant in tail.</P>
<P>To &s;upply this defect, lawyers have in|vented a re&s;olutive or irritant clau&s;e, which is calculated to void the right of a tenant in tail, who, contrary to a prohibition, aliens or contracts debt. That a re&s;olutive or for|feiting clau&s;e cannot have the &s;ame effect with a legal forfeiture, is even at fir&s;t view evident. A forfeiture is one of the puni&s;h|ments introduced for repre&s;&s;ing certain hei|nous crimes; and it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the thing, that a per&s;on &s;hould be puni&s;hed who is not a criminal. An aliena|tion by a tenant in tail, in oppo&s;ition to the will of the entailer, is no doubt a wrong: but then it is only a civil wrong inferring damages, and not a delinquency to infer any &s;ort of puni&s;hment; far le&s;s a puni&s;hment of the &s;evere&s;t kind, which at any rate cannot be inflicted but by authority of a &s;tatute. If now a re&s;olutive clau&s;e cannot have any
<PB N="206" REF="217">
effect as a puni&s;hment, its effect, if any, mu&s;t depend upon the con&s;ent of the tenant in tail, who accepts the deed of entail under the conditions and provi&s;ions contained in it. Such implied con&s;ent, taken in its ut|mo&s;t latitude, cannot be more binding than an expre&s;s con&s;ent &s;ignified by the heir in writing, binding him&s;elf to abandon his right to the land, upon the fir&s;t act of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, or of contravention, as we call it, whether by aliening or contracting debt. This device to &s;ecure an entailed &s;ubject, though it hath exhau&s;ted the whole inven|tion of our lawyers, is however &s;ingularly unlucky, &s;eeing it cannot be clothed in &s;uch words, as to hide, or even ob&s;cure, a palpable defect. The con&s;ent here is obviou&s;ly con|ditional, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hall abandon if I tran&s;gre&s;s or contraveen any of the prohibitions."</Q> Therefore, from the very nature of the thing, there can be no abandon till there fir&s;t be an act of contravention. This is not le&s;s clear than that the crime mu&s;t precede the puni&s;hment. Where then is the &s;ecurity
<PB N="207" REF="218">
that ari&s;es from a re&s;olutive clau&s;e? A te|nant in tail agrees to &s;ell by the lump: a di&s;|po&s;ition is made out&mdash;nothing wanting but the &s;ub&s;cription: the di&s;poner takes a pen in his hand, and begins to write his name. During this act there is no abandon nor for|feiture, becau&s;e as yet there is no alienation. Let it be &s;o, that the forfeiture takes place upon the la&s;t &s;troke of the pen; but then the alienation is al&s;o compleated by the &s;ame &s;troke; and the land is gone pa&s;t redemp|tion. The defect is &s;till more palpable, if po&s;&s;ible, in the ca&s;e of contracting debt. No man can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without contracting debt more or le&s;s; and no lawyer has been found &s;o chimerical as to a&s;&s;ert, that the contract|ing debt &s;ingly will produce a forfeiture. All agree, that the debtor's right is for|feited no &s;ooner than when the debt is &s;e|cured upon the land by an adjudication. But what avails the forfeiture after the debt is made real and &s;ecured upon the land? In a word, before the adjudication be com|pleated there can be no forfeiture, and after
<PB N="208" REF="219">
it is compleated, the forfeiture comes too late.</P>
<P>BUT this imperfection of a re&s;olutive clau&s;e, though clear and certain, needed &s;carce to have been mentioned, becau&s;e it will make no figure in compari&s;on with ano|ther, which I now proceed to unfold. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, contrary to the nature of things, that the forfeiture could precede the crime; or let us &s;uppo&s;e the very &s;imple&s;t ca&s;e, that a tenant in tail con&s;ents to abandon his right without any condition; what will follow? It is a rule in law, which never has been called in que&s;tion, That con&s;ent alone without de|livery cannot transfer property. Nay, it is univer&s;ally admitted, that con&s;ent alone can|not even have the effect to dive&s;t the con|&s;enter of his property till another be inve&s;t|ed; or, which comes to the &s;ame, that one infeftment cannot be taken away but by another. If &s;o, what avails a re&s;olutive clau&s;e more than one that is &s;imply prohi|bitory? Suppo&s;e the con&s;ent to abandon,
<PB N="209" REF="220">
which at fir&s;t was conditional, is now puri|fied by an act of contravention; the tenant in tail is indeed laid open to have his right voided, and the land taken from him: but &s;till he remains proprietor, and his infeft|ment &s;tands good till the next heir be infeft; or at lea&s;t till the next heir obtain a decree declaring the forfeiture. Before &s;uch pro|ce&s;s be commenced, every debt contracted by the tenant in tail, and every di&s;po&s;ition granted by him, mu&s;t be effectual, being deeds of a man, who, at the time of exe|cuting, was proprietor. In fine, a con&s;ent to abandon, &s;uppo&s;ing it purified, can in no view have a &s;tronger effect, than a contract of &s;ale executed by a proprietor who is un|der no limitation. All the world knows, that this will not bar him from &s;elling the land a &s;econd time to a different per&s;on, who getting the fir&s;t infeftment will be &s;e|cure; leaving no remedy to the fir&s;t pur|cha&s;er, but an action of damages again&s;t the vender. In like manner, a tenant in tail, after tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing every prohibition con|tained
<PB N="210" REF="221">
in the entail, and after all the irri|tancies have taken place, continues &s;till pro|prietor, until a decree declaring the irri|tancy be obtained; and &s;uch being the ca&s;e, it follows of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that every debt contracted by him, and every deed done by him, while there is yet no declarator, mu&s;t be effectual again&s;t the entailed e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I am aware, that in the deci&s;ion, 26th February 1662, Vi&s;count of Stormant <HI>contra</HI> heirs of line and creditors of the Earl of Annandale, prohibitory and re&s;olutive clau&s;es ingro&s;&s;ed in the infeftment were &s;u|&s;tained, as being equivalent to an interdic|tion; every man being pre&s;umed to know the condition of the per&s;on with whom he deals. But it appears probable, that this judgment was obtained by a prevailing at|tachment to entails, which, at that time, had the grace of novelty, and were not &s;een in their proper light. There is cer|tainly no ground for be&s;towing the force of
<PB N="211" REF="222">
an interdiction upon prohibitory and re&s;o|lutive clau&s;es in an entail. An interdiction is a writ of the common law, prohibiting the proprietor to &s;ell without con&s;ent of his interdictors, and prohibiting every per|&s;on to deal with him without &s;uch con|&s;ent. It is notified to all and &s;undry by a &s;olemn act of publication, which puts every per&s;on in <HI>mala fide</HI> to deal with a proprietor who is interdicted; and it is a contempt of legal authority to tran&s;gre&s;s the prohibi|tion. Prohibitory and re&s;olutive clau&s;es in an entail, being provi&s;ions in a private deed, have no authority except again&s;t the heir who con&s;ents to them; becau&s;e none except the heir are &s;uppo&s;ed to know, or bound to know them: and therefore, &s;uch clau&s;es notwith&s;tanding, every per&s;on is in <HI>optima fide</HI> to deal with the tenant in tail. In or|der to &s;upply the want of publication, if it be urged, that every man is pre&s;umed to be acquainted with the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e with whom he contracts, I deny there is any &s;uch legal pre&s;umption. In fact, no|thing
<PB N="212" REF="223">
is more common than to execute a contract of &s;ale, without &s;eeing any of the title-deeds of the &s;ubject purcha&s;ed; and a di&s;covery afterwards of the entail will not oblige the purcha&s;er to relinqui&s;h a profitable bargain. At any rate the contract of &s;ale mu&s;t operate to him, if not a performance of the bargain, at lea&s;t a claim of damages again&s;t the vender, either of which de&s;troys the entail. What if the creditors of the tenant in tail, or perhaps of the entailer, have arre&s;ted the price in the hands of the purcha&s;er? He cannot thereafter hurt the arre&s;ters by pa&s;&s;ing from the contract of &s;ale. Let us put another ca&s;e, That entail|ed lands, after being &s;old, and the purcha&s;er infeft, have again been purcha&s;ed from him; and we may &s;uppo&s;e a chain of &s;uch pur|cha&s;ers deriving right each from the one that goes before him. It &s;urely will not be affirmed, that the la&s;t purcha&s;er, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to know that the land was derived from a tenant in tail. This would be &s;tretching a pre&s;umption very
<PB N="213" REF="224">
far. But I need not go farther than the contracting of debt, to &s;how the weakne&s;s of the argument from pre&s;umed knowledge. Per&s;ons without their con&s;ent become credi|tors every day, who furni&s;h goods or work for ready money, and yet obtain not pay|ment; &s;ometimes again&s;t their will, as when a claim of damages is founded upon a wrong done. When one becomes cautioner for his friend, it is not u&s;ual to con&s;ult title-deeds. In &s;hort, &s;o little foundation is there for this pre&s;umption of knowledge, that the act 24. p. 1695, made for the relief of tho&s;e who contract with heirs apparent, is founded up|on the direct oppo&s;ite pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>SOME eminent lawyers, aware of the fore|going difficulties, have endeavoured to &s;up|port entails, by conceiving a tenant in tail to be, in effect, but a liferenter, preci&s;ely as of old when the feudal law was in vigour. What it is that operates this limitation of right, they do not &s;ay. Nor do they &s;ay upon what authority their opinion is founded: not &s;ure|ly
<PB N="214" REF="225">
upon any entail that ever was made. If the full property be in the entailer, it mu&s;t be equally &s;o in every heir of entail who repre|&s;ents him; becau&s;e, &s;uch as he has it, it is con|veyed to the heirs of entail whole and undi|vided, without re&s;erving any &s;hare to him&s;elf or a &s;eparate &s;et of heirs. But the very form of an entail is &s;ufficient to confute this opinion: for why &s;o many anxious prohibi|tory and irritant clau&s;es, if a tenant in tail were re&s;trained from aliening by the limited nature of his right. Fetters are very pro|per where one can do mi&s;chief; but they make a mo&s;t ridiculous figure upon the weak and timorous, incapable of doing the lea&s;t harm.</P>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid upon this head may be contracted within narrower bounds. It re|&s;olves into a propo&s;ition, vouched by our lawyers, and admitted by our judges in all their rea&s;onings upon the &s;ubject of entails, <HI>viz.</HI> That a re&s;olutive clau&s;e when incurred, doth not <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> forfeit the tenant in tail,
<PB N="215" REF="226">
but only makes his right voidable, by &s;ub|jecting him to a declarator of forfeiture; and that there is no forfeiture till a decree of declarator be obtained. Such being the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine with re&s;pect to irritant clau&s;es, I never can cea&s;e wonder|ing, to find it a general opinion, that an entail with &s;uch clau&s;es is effectual by the common law. For what propo&s;ition can be more clear than the following, That &s;o long as a man remains proprietor, his debts mu&s;t be effectual again&s;t his land as well as again&s;t him&s;elf? What compari&s;on can be more accurate, than betwixt a tenant in tail who has incurred an irritancy, and a feuar who has neglected to pay his feu|duties for two years? Both of them are &s;ub|jected to a declarator of irritancy, and both of them will be forfeited by a de|cree of declarator. But an adjudication upon the feuar's debt, before commencing the declarator, will be effectual upon the land. This was never doubted; and there is as little rea&s;on to doubt, that an adjudi|cation
<PB N="216" REF="227">
upon the debt of a tenant in tail, mu&s;t, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, be equal|ly effectual. If there be a difference, it fa|vours the latter, who cannot be &s;tript of his right till it be acquired by another; where|as a bare extinction of the feuar's right is &s;ufficient to the &s;uperior. I cannot ac|count for an opinion void of all foundation, otherwi&s;e than from the weight of autho|rity. Finding entails current in England, we were, by the force of imitation, led to think, they might be equally effectual here; being ignorant, or not adverting, that in England, their whole efficacy was derived from &s;tatute.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this tract with a brief reflection upon the whole. While the world was rude and illiterate, the relation of pro|perty was faint and ob&s;cure. This relation was gradually evolved, and, in its growth to|wards maturity, accompanied the growing &s;agacity of mankind, till it became vigorous and authoritative, as we find it at pre&s;ent.
<PB N="217" REF="228">
Men are fond of power, e&s;pecially over what they call their own; and all men con&s;pired to make the powers of property as exten&s;ive as po&s;&s;ible. Many centuries have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince property was carried its utmo&s;t length. No moderate man can de&s;ire more than to have the free di&s;po&s;al of his goods during his li&s;e, and to name the per&s;ons who &s;hall enjoy them after his death. Old Rome as well as Greece acknowledged the&s;e powers to be in|herent in property; and the&s;e powers are &s;ufficient for all the purpo&s;es to which the goods of fortune can be &s;ub&s;ervient. They fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of commerce; and they fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of benevo|lence. But the pa&s;&s;ions of men are not to be confined within the bounds of rea&s;on: we thir&s;t after opulence, and are not &s;atis|fied with the full enjoyment of the goods of fortune, unle&s;s it be al&s;o in our power to give them a perpetual exi&s;tence, and to pre&s;erve them for ever to our&s;elves, and our families. This purpo&s;e, we are con|&s;cious, cannot be fully accompli&s;hed; but we
<PB N="218" REF="229">
approach to it as near as we can, by the aid of imagination. The man who has ama&s;&s;ed great wealth, cannot think of quiting his hold, and yet, alas! he mu&s;t die and leave the enjoyment to others. To colour a di&s;|mal pro&s;pect, he makes a deed arre&s;ting fleet|ing property, &s;ecuring his e&s;tate to him&s;elf, and to tho&s;e who repre&s;ent him, in an end|le&s;s train of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. His e&s;tate and his heirs mu&s;t for ever bear his name; every thing to perpetuate his memory and his wealth. How unfit for the frail condition of mortals, are &s;uch &s;woln conceptions? The feudal &s;y|&s;tem unluckily &s;ugge&s;ted a hint for gratify|ing this irrational appetite. Entails in Eng|land, authori&s;ed by &s;tatute, &s;pread every where with great rapidity, till becoming a publick nu&s;ance, they were checked and de|feated by the authority of judges without a &s;tatute. It was a wonderful blindne&s;s in our legi&s;lature, to encourage entails by a &s;tatute, at a time when the publick intere&s;t required a &s;tatute again&s;t tho&s;e which had already been impo&s;ed upon us. A great proportion
<PB N="219" REF="230">
of our land is already, by authority of the &s;tatute 1685, exempted from commerce. To this dead &s;tock portions of land are daily added by new entails; and if the Briti&s;h le|gi&s;lature interpo&s;e not, the time in which the whole will be locked up is not far di|&s;tant. How pernicious this event mu&s;t prove, need not be explained. Land-property, na|turally one of the great ble&s;&s;ings of life, is thus converted into a cur&s;e. That entails are &s;ubver&s;ive of indu&s;try and commerce, is not the wor&s;t that ju&s;tly can be &s;aid of them; they appear in a &s;till more di&s;agreeable light, when viewed with relation to tho&s;e more immediately affected. A &s;nare they are to the thoughtle&s;s proprietor, who, even by a &s;ingle act, may be entangled pa&s;t hope of re|lief; to the cautious again they are a perpe|tual &s;ource of di&s;content, by &s;ubverting that liberty and independency, to which all men a&s;pire, with re&s;pect to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as well as their per&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>TRACT IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD>HISTORY OF SECURITIES upon LAND for payment of debt.</HEAD>
<P>THE multiplied connections among individuals in &s;ociety, and their va|rious tran&s;actions, have be&s;towed a privilege upon land-property, not only of being transferred from hand to hand whole and entire, but of being &s;plit into parts, and being di&s;tributed among many. Land is the great object of commerce, and it is u&s;eful not only by its product, but by affording the
<PB N="222" REF="232">
highe&s;t &s;ecurity that can be given for pay|ment of debt. Thus the property of land is &s;plit, betwixt the &s;uperior and va&s;&s;al, be|twixt the debtor and creditor, and betwixt one having a perpetual and one a temporary right.</P>
<P>IN Scotland we di&s;tingui&s;h, and not with|out rea&s;on, rights affecting land into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Property, and a right burdening or limiting property. Property, in its na|ture unbounded, cannot otherwi&s;e be bound|ed, but by rights burdening or narrowing it; and it is re&s;tored to its original unbounded &s;tate &s;o &s;oon as the burdening right is ex|tingui&s;hed: but a burdening right, being in its nature bounded, becomes not more ex|ten&s;ive by the extinction of other rights affecting the &s;ame &s;ubject. The Engli&s;h, without di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt property and other rights, conceive every right affecting land, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and the mo&s;t li|mited, to be an e&s;tate in the land. A fee-&s;imple, a fee-tail, a life-rent, a rent-charge,
<PB N="223" REF="233">
a lea&s;e for life, pa&s;s all equally under the denomination of an e&s;tate. And in this &s;en&s;e it is very con&s;i&s;tent, that different per|&s;ons may, at the &s;ame time, po&s;&s;e&s;s e&s;tates in the &s;ame land.</P>
<P>THE &s;pliting land-property into &s;o many parts, favourable indeed to commerce, makes law intricate, and purcha&s;es un&s;ecure: but the&s;e inconveniencies are unavoidable in a commercial country. Land is not divi&s;ible indefinitely; for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;maller quantity than what occupies a plow, or a &s;pade, is of no u&s;e: and he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;malle&s;t profitable &s;hare, may be engaged in tran&s;actions and connections, not fewer nor le&s;s various than he is who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large territory. It may be his will to make a &s;ettlement, containing remainders, rever|&s;ions, rent-charges, &amp;c.; and it is the pro|vince of municipal law, to make effectual, as far as utility will admit, private deeds and conventions of every &s;ort. This is &s;o evi|dent, that wherever we read of great &s;im|plicity
<PB N="224" REF="234">
in the manner of tran&s;mitting land-property, we may a&s;&s;uredly pronounce, that the people are not far advanced in the arts of life.</P>
<P>THE foregoing cur&s;ory view of land-rights, and of their divi&s;ibility, if I may be indulged the expre&s;&s;ion, lead to the &s;ubject propo&s;ed to be handled in this e&s;&s;ay. The Romans had two forms of a right upon land for &s;ecu|rity of money. The one, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Antichre&s;is,</HI> re&s;embles the Eng|li&s;h mortgage, and our wad&s;et; the creditor being introduced into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to levy the rents for extingui&s;hing the &s;um that is due him. The other, termed a <HI>Hypothec,</HI> is barely a &s;ecurity for money, without power to levy the rents for payment. As to the former, whether any &s;olemnity was requi&s;ite to compleat the right, I cannot &s;ay, becau&s;e this &s;ort of &s;ecurity is but &s;lightly mentioned in Ju&s;tinian's compilations: neither is it told us whether any form was requi&s;ite to com|pleat the latter. One thing &s;eems evident
<PB N="225" REF="235">
with re&s;pect to a right which entitles not the creditor to po&s;&s;e&s;s, that an act of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whether real or &s;ymbolical, cannot be re|quired as a &s;olemnity. But as it is difficult to conceive, that a right can be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon land by con&s;ent alone, without &s;ome ouvert act, therefore in Holland there is required to the con&s;titution of a hypothec upon land or hou&s;es, the pre&s;ence of a judge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voet, Tit. de Pignor. et Hypoth. &sect; 9 and 10.</NOTE>. And in Frie&s;land, to compleat a general hypothec, &s;o as to give it preference, regi&s;tration is nece&s;&s;ary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ib. &sect; 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the Roman law, to make a hypothec effectual, when payment could not be ob|tained from the debtor, the creditor was impowered to expo&s;e the land to &s;ale after repeated denounciations. He needed not the authority of a judge; and as he him|&s;elf was the vender, he &s;or that rea&s;on could not be al&s;o the purcha&s;er. But Voet<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit de de&s;truct. pignor. &sect; 3.</NOTE> ob|&s;erves, that in Holland the authority of a
<PB N="226" REF="236">
judge being nece&s;&s;ary, and the judge being the vender, the creditor may be the pur|cha&s;er.</P>
<P>IT appears to have been of old, both in England and Scotland, a lawful practice, to force payment of debt, by taking, at &s;hort hand from the debtor, a pledge, which was detained by the creditor, till the debtor repledged the &s;ame, by paying the debt, or finding &s;ecurity for the payment. This rough practice was in England prohibited by the &s;tatute 52d Henry III. cap. 1. enact|ing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no man take a di&s;tre&s;s of his neighbour without award of court."</Q> In Scotland it was re&s;trained by &s;everal &s;ta|tutes. In the fir&s;t &s;tatutes Robert I. cap. 7. it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That in time coming no man take a poynd for debt within ano|ther man's land, unle&s;s the King's baillie, or the baillie of the ground be pre&s;ent."</Q> And in the &s;tatutes of David II. cap. 6. '<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if a man dwelling in one &s;hire de|&s;ire to take a poynd in another &s;hire, it
<PB N="227" REF="237">
mu&s;t be done in pre&s;ence of the &s;heriff or his depute."</Q> Again, in the &s;tatutes of Robert III. cap. 12. it is enacted in general, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no man &s;hall take a poynd without the King's officers, or the Lord's officers of the land, unle&s;s within his own land, for his farms or proper debts."</Q> See to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, Reg. Maj. L. 4. cap. 22.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e regulations did not extend to poinding within a royal borough. For though a burge&s;s might not poind a bro|ther burge&s;s without licence from the pro|vo&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leg. Burg. cap. 4.</NOTE>, yet from a &s;tranger found within the borough he might take a poind or pledge at &s;hort hand<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cap. 34 and 58.</NOTE>; and the &s;tranger behoved to repledge in common form, by finding a &s;urety for the debt<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cap. 35 and 37.</NOTE>. This, by the way, is plainly the foundation of the privilege which burge&s;&s;es enjoy at this day, <HI>viz.</HI> arre&s;ting &s;trangers for debts contracted within the borough.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="238">
NEITHER did the&s;e regulations extend to rents or feu-duties, for which, in Eng|land, the landlord may to this day di&s;train at &s;hort hand. And in this part of the i&s;land, as a proprietor might poind at &s;hort hand for his hou&s;e-mail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leg. Burg. cap. 57.</NOTE>, and for his rents in the country<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t Stat. Rob. I. cap. 7.</NOTE>, &s;o this privilege is expre&s;ly re&s;erved to him in the above mentioned &s;ta|tute of Robert III. This privilege of the landlord may be traced down to the pre&s;ent time; with &s;ome re&s;trictions, it is true, in|troduced by change of manners. Craig ob&s;erves<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">L. 1. Dieg. 10. &sect; 38. in fine.</NOTE>, That the landlord for three terms rent can poind by his private autho|rity; and <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">L. 2.

Nor at pre&s;ent is the landlord or &s;uperior &s;ub|jected to the ordinary &s;olemnities. It is required indeed, that the arrears be con&s;ti|tuted by a decree in his own court, which has been introduced in imitation of poind|ing
<PB N="229" REF="239">
other debts; but after con&s;tituting the arrears by a decree, he may proceed directly to poind without giving a charge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. 4. p. 1669.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOR is it difficult to di&s;cover the foun|dation of this privilege. It will appear in a clear light by tracing the hi&s;tory of lea&s;es in this i&s;land. Lands originally were oc|cupied by bond-men, who them&s;elves were the property of the landlord, and con&s;e|quently were not capable to hold any pro|perty of their own: but &s;uch per&s;ons, who had no intere&s;t to be indu&s;trious, and who were under no compul&s;ion, when not under the eye of their ma&s;ter, were generally lazy, and always carele&s;s. This made it eligible to have a free man to manage the farm; who probably at fir&s;t got &s;ome acres &s;et apart to him for his maintenance and wages. But this not being a &s;ufficient &s;pur to in|du&s;try, it was found a &s;alutary mea&s;ure to a&s;&s;ume this man as a partner, by communi|cating to him a proportion of the product
<PB N="230" REF="240">
in place of wages; by which he came to manage for his own intere&s;t as well as that of his ma&s;ter. The next &s;tep had &s;till a better effect, entitling the ma&s;ter to a year|ly quantity certain, and the overplus to re|main with the &s;ervant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SERVIS, non in no&s;trum morem, de&s;criptis per fami|liam mini&s;teriis, utuntur. Suam qui&s;que &s;edem, &s;uos paenates regit. Frumenti modum dominus, aut pecoris, aut ve&s;tis, ut colono injungit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tacitus de moribus Germanorum.</NOTE>.</NOTE>. By this contract, the benefit of the &s;ervant's indu&s;try accrued wholly to him&s;elf; and his indolence or ig|norance hurt him&s;elf alone. One farther &s;tep was nece&s;&s;ary, to bring this contract to its due perfection, which is, to give the &s;er|vant a lea&s;e for years, without which he is not &s;ecure that his indu&s;try will turn to his own profit. By a contract in the&s;e terms he acquired the name of <HI>Tenant;</HI> becau&s;e he was entitled to hold the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for years certain. According to this deduction, which is &s;upported by the nature of the thing, the tenant had only a claim by virtue of the contract, for that part of the product
<PB N="231" REF="241">
he was entitled to. He had no real lien to found upon in oppo&s;ition to his landlord's property. The whole fruits as <HI>pars &s;oli</HI> be|longed to the landlord, while growing up|on the ground; and the act of &s;eparating them from the ground, could not transfer the property from him to his tenant: nei|ther could payment of the rent transfer the property of the remaining fruits, without actual delivery. It is true, the tenant, im|powered by the contract, could lawfully ap|ply this remainder to his own u&s;e: but &s;till while upon the ground, it was the landlord's property; and for that rea&s;on, as we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards, lay open to be attached for payment of the landlord's debts.</P>
<P>MATTERS, it is true, were greatly alter|ed by the act 18. p. 1449, making the te|nant &s;ecure again&s;t a purcha&s;er of the land. This &s;tatute was under&s;tood to give the le&s;&s;ee a real lien upon the land, or to make a lea&s;e, when compleated by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a real right, as we term it in Scotland; for a
<PB N="232" REF="242">
lea&s;e, con&s;idered as a covenant merely, can only be effectual betwixt the contracters. The real right thus e&s;tabli&s;hed in the te|nant, behoved to regulate the property of the fruits. The maxim, <HI>Quod &s;atum cedit &s;olo,</HI> which formerly gave the property to the landlord, was thought to apply now in favour of the tenant; and thus, after the rent was paid, the remaining fruits came to be con&s;idered as the tenant's property. The landlord's property however, continued in|violable, &s;o far as his rent extended. To this limited effect he was held proprietor, ju&s;t as much as before the &s;tatute was made: and therefore there was nothing &s;ingular in allowing him to levy his rents by his own authority, whether from his tenants or from his feuars, who differ not from tenants but in the perpetuity of their lea&s;es. It was no more than what follows from the very na|ture of property; for no man needs the authority of a judge to lay hold of his own goods. There could not be a &s;cruple about this privilege, while rents were paid in kind;
<PB N="233" REF="243">
and landlords, authori&s;ed by cu&s;tom, pro|ceeded in the &s;ame train when money-rent was introduced, without adverting to the difference: but after the landlord's rent was paid, it &s;oon came to be reckoned an into|lerable grievance, and indeed gro&s;s inju&s;tice, that the landlord's creditor &s;hould be ad|mitted to poind the remainder, which was in reality the tenant's property; and the &s;tatute had &s;o quick an operation, that a remedy was provided, at lea&s;t as to per&s;onal debt, by the act 36. p. 1469, re&s;tricting poindings for &s;uch debts, to the extent of the arrears due by the tenant, and to the current term. With regard to debts &s;ecured upon the land, the legi&s;lature did not inter|po&s;e; for it was judged, that the creditor who had a real lien upon the land, had the &s;ame title to the fruits for payment of his intere&s;t, that the landlord had for pay|ment of his rent. It was not adverted to, that a creditor is not bound to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the land for his payment; that the landlord is entitled to levy the rent if the
<PB N="234" REF="244">
creditor forbear; and that it is unju&s;t to oblige the tenant to pay the &s;ame rent twice. But what was neglected or avoided by the legi&s;lature, was provided for by cu&s;tom; ju|&s;tice, in this matter, prevailing over ancient u&s;age. And now, tenants are by practice &s;ecure again&s;t poinding for real debts, as well as they are by &s;tatute again&s;t poinding for per&s;onal debts. In England it appears, that, to this day, the creditor in a rent-charge may levy a di&s;tre&s;s to the extent of what is due to him, without confining the di&s;tre&s;s to the rent due by the tenant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See 2d Will. and Mary, cap. 5.</NOTE>. And indeed this is nece&s;&s;ary in England where it is not the practice to take the land it&s;elf in execution. But of this afterwards.</P>
<P>IT was nece&s;&s;ary to explain at large the privilege which landlords have at common law to force payment of their rents; becau&s;e it is a fundamental doctrine with relation to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the ca&s;e of a creditor who hath
<PB N="235" REF="245">
obtained a &s;ecurity upon land for debt due to him. Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;titut. page 268.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that the Engli&s;h di&s;tingui&s;h rent, in rent-&s;ervice, rent-charge, and rent-&s;eck. Rent-&s;ervice is that which is due by the <HI>reddendo</HI> of a char|ter of land, &s;uch as a feu or blench-duty. Rent-charge is that which is con&s;tituted by the landlord in favour of a creditor, con|taining a clau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, impowering the creditor to di&s;train the land at &s;hort hand for payment of the debt<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New abridgement of the law, Tit. (Annuity and rent-charge.)</NOTE>. A deed of the &s;ame nature without a clau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s is termed rent-&s;eck.</P>
<P>A rent-charge mu&s;t be compleated by the writing alone without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e the creditor, until he have a claim for in|tere&s;t, cannot lawfully take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or levy rent. And it is evident, that po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion cannot be nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a right upon land, when &s;uch right admits not of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A rent-&s;eck is in a different ca&s;e,
<PB N="236" REF="246">
as may appear from the following con&s;idera|tions. The tenants are not per&s;onally liable to the creditor; and the deed, which con|tains no clau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, affords no title to take a pledge from them. If therefore they be unwilling to pay their rents to the creditor, he has no remedy but a per&s;onal action again&s;t the granter of the deed. A tenant, it is true, acknowledging a rent-&s;eck, by delivering but a &s;ingle penny in part payment, puts the creditor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of levying rent; after which, if the tenant refu&s;e to pay, it is con&s;trued a di&s;&s;ei&s;in, to entitle the creditor to an a&s;&s;ize of nouvel di&s;&s;ei&s;in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jacob's law dictionary, Tit. (Rent.)</NOTE>. But before &s;ei&s;in or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o had by the creditor, I &s;ee not that in any &s;en&s;e the rent-&s;eck can be con&s;trued a real right. A hypothec is a real right, be|cau&s;e the creditor can &s;ell the land if the debtor fail to make payment. A rent-charge is a real right, becau&s;e the creditor can levy rent when his term of payment comes. But no right can be conceived to be real, or a
<PB N="237" REF="247">
branch of property, which gives the creditor no power whatever over the land. And upon this account, if the land be &s;old before a creditor in a rent-&s;eck is acknowledged by the tenants, the purcha&s;er, I pre&s;ume, will be preferred.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now hinted at the means for recovering payment, afforded by law to the creditor in a rent-&s;eck. The creditor in a rent-charge, &s;tanding on the &s;ame footing with the landlord, hath a much ea&s;ier me|thod. Where the rent payable to the land|lord is a certain quantity of the fruits of the ground, the creditor lays hold of the rent at &s;hort hand, which concludes the proce&s;s with re&s;pect to the tenant. The operation is not altogether &s;o &s;imple in the ca&s;e of money-rent. The creditor, in this ca&s;e, lays hold of any goods upon the land, corn or cattle, con&s;idered as the land|lord's property: but then, as the goods di|&s;trained belong in reality to the tenant, free of all embargo &s;o &s;oon as the rent is paid,
<PB N="238" REF="248">
the tenant, for that rea&s;on, is entitled to re|pledge the &s;ame, or to demand re&s;titution, upon making payment of the rent, or giving &s;ecurity for it. The creditor in di&s;training thus, for obtaining payment, has not occa|&s;ion for a decree, nor is it even nece&s;&s;ary that he di&s;train in pre&s;ence of an officer of the law. But this form, though ea&s;y in one re&s;pect, with regard to the creditor as well as the landlord, is not however effectual to draw payment, unle&s;s the tenant concur by repledging and &s;ub&s;tituting &s;ecurity in place of the goods. If the tenant be unable to find a &s;urety, or perver&s;e enough to ne|glect his intere&s;t, there was no remedy till the 2d of William and Mary, cap. 5. by which it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That in ca&s;e the te|nant or owner of the goods, do not with|in five days replevy the &s;ame, with &s;uffi|cient &s;ecurity for the rent, the creditor &s;hall have liberty to &s;ell for payment of the rent."</Q> Thus the form of di&s;train|ing upon a rent-charge was made compleat: but a rent-&s;eck remained a very precarious
<PB N="239" REF="249">
&s;ecurity, for the rea&s;ons above mentioned, till the 4th Geo. II. cap. 28. by which it is enacted, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the like remedy by di|&s;tre&s;s, and by impoinding and &s;elling the goods, &s;hall be in the ca&s;e of rent-&s;eck, that is provided in the ca&s;e of rent re|&s;erved upon lea&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>THAT a power to &s;ell the goods di&s;train|ed, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to make rent effectual, &s;hould not have been introduced more early, mu&s;t appear &s;urpri&s;ing. But it is remarkable, that the Engli&s;h are greatly addicted to old u&s;ages. Another thing is not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing in this form of execution, for which no re|medy is provided, that it is indulged to be followed out by private authority, when in all other civilized countries, execution is not tru&s;ted to any but the officers of the law.</P>
<P>I have another ob&s;ervation to make upon this &s;ubject, That in the infancy of govern|ment, &s;horter methods are indulged to come at right, than afterwards when under a go|vernment
<PB N="240" REF="250">
long &s;ettled, the ob&s;tinacy and ferocity of man are &s;ubdued, and ready obe|dience is paid to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws and cu|&s;toms. By the Roman law, a creditor could &s;ell his pledge at &s;hort hand. With us of old a creditor could even take a pledge at &s;hort hand; and which was wor&s;e than ei|ther, it was lawful for a man to take re|venge at his own hand for injuries done him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tract I.</NOTE>. None of the&s;e things, it is pre&s;um|ed, are permitted at pre&s;ent in any civilized country, England excepted, where the an|cient privilege of forcing payment at &s;hort|hand, competent to the landlord and to the creditor by a rent-charge, is &s;till in force.</P>
<P>AND now to come to our own &s;ecurities upon land for payment of debt, we find, in the fir&s;t place, That originally our law was the &s;ame with that of England, as to the form of making rent-&s;ervices effectual, <HI>viz.</HI> taking a di&s;tre&s;s at &s;hort hand, to be re|pledged by the tenant upon finding &s;ecurity
<PB N="241" REF="251">
for the arrears. We have regulations laid down as to the method of taking a di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> that the goods mu&s;t remain in the &s;ame barony till they be repledged, or at lea&s;t in the next adjacent barony, and within the &s;ame &s;heriffdom, but not in ca&s;tles or fortalices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t Stat. Rob. I. cap. 7.</NOTE>; regulations which obviou&s;ly are borrowed from 52d Henry III. cap. 4. In the next place, when we con&s;ider that the &s;y&s;tem of our laws and government is fun|damentally the &s;ame with that of England, and that nothing is more natural than to adopt the manners and cu&s;toms of a more potent nation in clo&s;s neighbourhood, it is a &s;uppo&s;ition extremely probable, That a rent-charge was in practice with us as well as with the Engli&s;h. Luckily we have di|rect evidence of the fact. Several of the&s;e &s;ecurities are pre&s;erved to this day; though they are long out of u&s;e, having given place to what is called an infeftment of annual|rent, which is a land-&s;ecurity e&s;tabli&s;hed in the feudal form.

<P>THE bond la&s;t mentioned is an in&s;tance the more happy, as it affords irrefragable evidence, that a rent-charge in this country, was, in all re&s;pects, the &s;ame as in England; and particularly, that the creditor enjoyed that &s;ingular privilege of the landlord, to di&s;train at &s;hort hand without the authority of a judge. It &s;erves at the &s;ame time to explain the regulations of Robert I. and of Robert III. about poinding, which, from
<PB N="244" REF="254">
analogy of the law of England, and from the po&s;itive evidence of this deed, mu&s;t ap|pear now to relate to per&s;onal debts only, and by no means to rent-charges more than to rent-&s;ervices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A clau&s;e burdening a di&s;po&s;ition of land with a &s;um to a third party, is, in our practice, made effectual by poinding the ground. A right thus e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;trongly re&s;embles a rent-charge. The power which in this ca&s;e the creditor hath to poind the ground, can have no other foundation to re&s;t on, than a clau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, which is expre&s;t in a rent-charge, and is implied in the right we are &s;peaking of.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHETHER our law be improved by &s;ub|&s;tituting an infeftment of annualrent in place of a rent-charge may be doubted. I pro|po&s;e to handle this &s;ubject at lei&s;ure, becau&s;e it is curious. While land was held as a pro|per benefice for &s;ervices performed to a &s;u|perior, the whole forms relating to &s;uch a grant, and the whole ca&s;ualties due to the &s;uperior, were agreeable to the nature of the tenure: but when land returned to be a &s;ub|ject of commerce, and, like moveables, to be exchanged for money, forms and ca&s;ualties, which were the re&s;ult of the feudal connec|tion
<PB N="245" REF="255">
betwixt the &s;uperior and va&s;&s;al, could regularly have no place in the&s;e new tran&s;|actions, with which they were incon&s;i&s;tent in every re&s;pect. When a man makes a pur|cha&s;e of land and pays a &s;ull price, the pur|po&s;e of the bargain is, That he &s;hall have the unlimited property, without being &s;ub|jected in any manner to the vender: and yet &s;uch is the force of cu&s;tom, that titles behoved to be made up in the feudal form, becau&s;e no other titles to land were in u&s;e. And thus the purcha&s;er, contrary to the nature of the tran&s;action, was metamor|pho&s;ed into a va&s;&s;al, and of con&s;equence &s;ub|jected to homage, fealty, non-entry, liferent e&s;cheat, &amp;c. upon account of that very land which he purcha&s;ed with his own money. Such an incon&s;i&s;tency, it is true, could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and form by degrees yielded to &s;ub&s;tance. When land came univer&s;ally to be patrimonial, and no longer beneficiary, the forms of the feudal law indeed remain|ed, but the &s;ub&s;tance wore out gradually. This change produced blench duties, an elu|&s;ory
<PB N="246" REF="256">
&s;um for non-entry in place of the full rents, collateral &s;ucce&s;&s;ion without limita|tion; and failing heirs, the King, and not the &s;uperior, as la&s;t heir: which regulations, with many others upon the &s;ame plan, are wide deviations from any tenure, that, in a proper &s;en&s;e, can be termed beneficiary. When the &s;ub&s;tantial part of the feudal law has thus vani&s;hed, it is to be regreted that we &s;hould &s;till lie under the oppre&s;&s;ion of its forms, which occa&s;ion great trouble and ex|pence in the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of land-property.</P>
<P>OUR forefathers, however, in adhering to the feudal forms after the &s;ub&s;tance was gone, merit le&s;s cen&s;ure than at fir&s;t &s;ight may appear ju&s;t from the foregoing deduc|tion. So many different per&s;ons were con|nected with the &s;ame portion of land, &s;tages of &s;uperiors being commonly interjected be|twixt the va&s;&s;al in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and the crown, that, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, it would have been difficult to throw off the feudal holding, and to make the right purely allodial. This
<PB N="247" REF="257">
affords a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for not attempt|ing early to withdraw land from under feu|dal titles. And when time di&s;covered that the feudal forms could be &s;queezed and moulded into a new &s;hape, &s;o as to corre|&s;pond in &s;ome mea&s;ure with a patrimonial e&s;tate, it is not wonderful that our forefa|thers acquie&s;ced in the forms that were in u&s;e, improper as they were.</P>
<P>BUT it will be a harder ta&s;k to ju&s;tify our forefathers for de&s;erting the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of a rent-charge, and for &s;ub&s;tituting in place of it an infeftment of annualrent, than which nothing in my apprehen&s;ion can be more ab&s;urd. For here a man, who hath no other intention but to obtain a real &s;ecurity for his money, is transformed, by a &s;ort of hocus-pocus trick, into a &s;ervant or va&s;&s;al, either of his debtor or of his debtor's &s;uperior. And to prevent a mi&s;take, as if this were for the &s;ake of form only, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the creditor is even held to be a military va&s;&s;al, bound to &s;erve his &s;uperior
<PB N="248" REF="258">
in war; if the contrary be not &s;pecified in the bond<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stair, page 263.</NOTE>. The &s;uperior again, after the creditor's death, was entitled to the non|entry duties, and it required an act of par|liament<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 42. p. 1692.</NOTE> to correct this glaring ab&s;urdity. It mu&s;t be confe&s;t to be &s;omewhat ludi|crous, that the heir of a creditor, acting, for form's &s;ake only, the part of a va&s;&s;al, and, by the nature of his right, bound nei|ther for &s;ervice nor duty to his imaginary &s;uperior, &s;hould yet be puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of the intere&s;t of his money for neglect|ing to enter heir, which might be hurtful to him&s;elf, but could not in any mea&s;ure hurt his debtor acting the part of a &s;uperior. In a word, it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive any form le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with the nature and &s;ub|&s;tance of the deed to which it relates, than an infeftment of annualrent is. The won|der is, how it ever came to be introduced, in oppo&s;ition to the more perfect form of a rent-charge. I can di&s;cover no other cau&s;e but one, which hath an arbitrary &s;way in
<PB N="249" REF="259">
law, as well as in more trivial matters, and that is the prevalency of fa&s;hion and opi|nion. We had long been accu&s;tomed to the feudal law, and to con&s;ider a feudal te|nure as the only compleat title to land. No man thought him&s;elf &s;ecure with a title of any other &s;ort. Juri&s;dictions and offices behoved to be brought under a feudal te|nure; and even creditors, influenced by the authority of fa&s;hion, were not &s;atisfied till they got their &s;ecurities in the &s;ame form.</P>
<P>AND this leads me to another ab&s;urdity in the con&s;titution of an annualrent-right, le&s;s con&s;picuous indeed than that above mentioned; and that is the order or precept to introduce the creditor directly into po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion: though, by the nature of his right, and by expre&s;s paction, he is not entitled to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or to levy rent, till the fir&s;t term's intere&s;t become due. Sei&s;in, it is true, is but a &s;ymbolical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but then, as &s;ymbolical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was invented to &s;ave the trouble of apprehending po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="250" REF="260">
really, it is improper, nay, it is ab&s;urd, to give &s;ymbolical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion before the per&s;on be entitled to po&s;&s;e&s;s. A &s;ei&s;in in|deed will be proper after intere&s;t becomes due: but a &s;ei&s;in at that time is unnece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e the creditor can enter really into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by levying rent; and &s;urely real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion can never be le&s;s compleat than &s;ymbolical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT tends not to reconcile us to an infeft|ment of annualrent, that, con&s;idered as a commercial &s;ubject, it is not le&s;s brittle than unwieldy. In its tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion as well as e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, it is attended with all the expence and trouble of land-property, without being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any advantage of land-property. It is extingui&s;hed by levying rent, by receiv|ing payment from the debtor, and even by a voluntary di&s;charge. In &s;hort, a per&s;onal bond is not extingui&s;hed with le&s;s ceremony. This circum&s;tance unqualifies it for com|merce; for there is no &s;afety in laying out money to purcha&s;e it. Nor does the &s;ymbo|lical
<PB N="251" REF="261">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by a &s;ei&s;in give it any advan|tage over a rent-charge. The &s;ei&s;in does not publi&s;h the &s;ecurity: regi&s;tration is nece&s;|&s;ary; and a rent-charge, which requires not infeftment, is as ea&s;ily recorded as a &s;ecurity e&s;tabli&s;hed by infeftment.</P>
<P>TO compleat this &s;ubject, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take a view of the execution that pro|ceeds upon an infeftment of annualrent; and comparing it with the ancient form of execution upon a rent-charge, to remark where they agree, and where they differ. In the fir&s;t place, The creditor in a rent|charge could not bring an action of debt again&s;t the tenants for their rents. His claim properly lay to the goods upon the land, which he was entitled to carry off, and to detain till the rent was paid to him. The law &s;tands the &s;ame to this day as to the per&s;onal action. An infeftment of annual|rent binds not the tenants to pay to the creditor: he has no claim again&s;t them per|&s;onally for their rents, unle&s;s there be in
<PB N="252" REF="262">
the deed an a&s;&s;ignment to the mails and duties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Durie, 24th March 1626, Gray <HI>contra</HI> Graham. Foun|tainhall, 5th July 1701, Kinloch <HI>contra</HI> Rochead.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT in the following particulars, exe|cution upon an infeftment of annualrent, or other <HI>debitum fundi,</HI> differs from exe|cution upon a rent-charge. Fir&s;t, An in|feftment of annualrent has not been long in u&s;e, and at the time when this &s;ecurity was introduced, more regularity and &s;olemnity were required in all matters of law than for|merly. Poinding could not now proceed upon a per&s;onal debt, till fir&s;t a decree was obtained again&s;t the debtor. But an infeft|ment of annualrent, if it did not contain an a&s;&s;ignment to mails and duties, afforded not an action again&s;t the tenants. Some other form therefore behoved to be con|trived, more &s;olemn than that of poinding by private authority. The form invented was to obtain the King's authority for poinding the ground, which was granted
<PB N="253" REF="263">
in a letter under the &s;ignet, directed to me&s;|&s;engers, &amp;c. I di&s;cover this to have been the practice in the time of our James V. or VI. it is uncertain which; for the letter is dated the 30th year of the reign of James, and no other king of that name reigned &s;o long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a copy of this letter in the Appendix, No. 3.</NOTE>. But with re&s;pect to the landlord's privilege of di&s;training the ground, it being afterwards judged nece&s;&s;ary, that a decree, in his own court at lea&s;t, &s;hould be inter|po&s;ed, the form was extended to an infeft|ment of annualrent. There was indeed &s;ome difficulty in what manner to frame a libel or declaration, con&s;idering that the creditor has not a per&s;onal action again&s;t the tenants, and can conclude nothing a|gain&s;t them to make the appearance of a proce&s;s. This difficulty is removed, or ra|ther di&s;gui&s;ed the be&s;t way po&s;&s;ible. The landlord and his tenants are called; for there can be no proce&s;s without a defendant. There is al&s;o a &s;ort of conclu&s;ion again&s;t them, very &s;ingular indeed, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The &s;aids
<PB N="254" REF="264">
defenders to hear and &s;ee letters of poynd|ing and appri&s;ing, directed by decreet of the &s;aids Lords, for poynding the ready|e&s;t goods and gear upon the ground of the &s;aid lands, &amp;c."</Q> A decree proceed|ing upon &s;uch a libel or declaration, if it can be called a decree, is in effect a judicial notification merely, to the landlord and his tenants, that the creditor is to proceed to execution. In a word, the &s;ingular na|ture of this decree proves it to be an api&s;h imitation of a decree for payment of debt, without which, as ob&s;erved above, poinding for per&s;onal debt cannot proceed.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, The property of the goods di&s;trained was not by the old form transferred to the creditor. The tenant might repledge at any time, upon paying his rent to the creditor, or finding &s;urety for the payment. I have no occa&s;ion here to take notice of the Engli&s;h &s;tatute, giv|ing power to the creditor to &s;ell the goods di&s;trained; becau&s;e the rent-charge was laid
<PB N="255" REF="265">
a&s;ide in Scotland, long before the &s;aid reme|dy was invented. This old form mu&s;t yield to our pre&s;ent form of poinding upon <HI>debita fundi,</HI> borrowed from poinding for payment of per&s;onal debt; which is, to &s;ell the goods if a purcha&s;er can be found; otherwi&s;e to adjudge them to the creditor upon a ju&s;t appretiation. 'Tis to be regreted, that in practice we have dropt the mo&s;t &s;alutary branch of the execution, which is that of &s;elling the goods. But &s;till, it is more com|modious to adjudge the goods to the cre|ditor upon a ju&s;t appretiation, than to make payment depend on the tenant; whereby matters may be kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>IN the next place, The mo&s;t remarkable difference is, that execution upon a <HI>debitum fundi</HI> is much farther extended than former|ly. Of old, execution was directed again&s;t the moveables only, that were found upon the land; but by our later practice, it is di|rected both again&s;t the moveables and a|gain&s;t the land it&s;elf, in their order. It ap|pears
<PB N="256" REF="266">
probable, that this novelty has been introduced, in imitation of execution for payment of per&s;onal debt, though there is no analogy betwixt them.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject affords an illu&s;trious ex|ample of the prevalency of humanity and equity, in oppo&s;ition to the rigour of the common law. By the common law, the creditor who hath a rent-charge, or an in|feftment of annualrent, may &s;weep off the tenant's whole moveables, for payment of the intere&s;t that is due upon his bond, and is not limited to the arrears of rent. But the palpable inju&s;tice of this execution with regard to the tenant, has produced a reme|dy; which is, that though goods may be impoinded to the extent of the intere&s;t due, yet the&s;e goods may be repledged by the tenant, upon payment of the arrears due by him and the current term. And in poinding for payment of per&s;onal debt, the attaching the tenant's goods even for the current term, is in di&s;u&s;e; and has given
<PB N="257" REF="267">
place to an arre&s;tment, which relieves the tenant from the hard&s;hip, of paying his rent before the term. The tenant remains &s;till expo&s;ed to this hard&s;hip, when a decree for poinding the ground is put in execution. But it is unavoidable in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e we have not hitherto admitted an arre&s;t|ment to be founded upon an infeftment of annualrent: and till this be introduced, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for indulging the poind|ing of goods for the current rent; for other|wi&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing the rents to be punctually paid, there would be no acce&s;s to the move|ables at all. This re&s;triction in a poind|ing of the ground, paved the way for poind|ing the land it&s;elf; which was &s;eldom ne|ce&s;&s;ary of old, when the moveables upon the land could be poinded without limitation.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>Levari Facias</HI> in England, rents payable to the debtor can be &s;eized in exe|cution. This being a more &s;ummary me|thod than arre&s;tment, for attaching rents, is the rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, that arre&s;tment is
<PB N="258" REF="268">
not u&s;ed in England. For if rents can be thus taken in execution, other debts mu&s;t be equally &s;ubjected to the &s;ame execution.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with pointing out &s;ome mi&s;takes in writers who handle the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Few things pa&s;&s;ing under the &s;ame name, differ more widely than the two kinds of poinding above mentioned. Poinding for payment of per&s;onal debt, proceeds upon a principle of common ju&s;tice, <HI>viz.</HI> That if a man will not di&s;po&s;e of his effects for pay|ment of his debts, the judge ought to inter|po&s;e, and wre&s;t them from him. Poinding for payment of debt &s;ecured upon land, is an exertion of the right of property. The effects are poinded or di&s;trained by the land|lord's order or warrant; and the execution can reach no effects but what are under&s;tood to be his property. His property, it is true, is limited, and cannot be exerted farther than to make the claim of debt effectual; and upon this account, the tenant, or others who have an intere&s;t in the effects poinded,
<PB N="259" REF="269">
may repledge, upon &s;atisfying the claim. But if they do not repledge, a proportion of the effects, is, in Scotland, adjudged to the creditor as his ab&s;olute property, with|out any rever&s;ion; becau&s;e, in legal execu|tion, matters ought not for ever to be in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Hence execution upon per&s;onal debt, is directed again&s;t the debtor, and the property is transferred from him to his cre|ditor. Execution again upon debt affect|ing land, is directed again&s;t the land and its product; and transfers not property, but only removes the limitations that were upon the landlord's property, by extingui&s;hing the tenant's right of rever&s;ion. Though the&s;e matters come out in a clear light, when traced to their origin, yet the two poindings are often confounded by our au|thors. Lord Stair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 4. Tit. 23. &sect; 1.</NOTE> mentions the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s as the foundation of both &s;orts of poinding, and remarks, that by the act 36. p. 1469, the irrational cu&s;tom of poinding the tenant's goods without limitation, was
<PB N="260" REF="270">
re&s;trained as to both. And he is copied by Mackenzie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In&s;tit. Book 2. Tit. 8. &sect; 14.</NOTE>. This is erroneous in every particular. The brieve of di&s;tre&s;s was no|thing el&s;e but the King's commi&s;&s;ion to a judge named, to determine upon a certain claim of debt. This brieve entitled the bearer to a decree, &s;uppo&s;ing his claim well &s;ounded; and of con&s;equence to poind for payment of the &s;um decreed. And the act now mentioned, introduceth a regulation, which re&s;pects &s;olely the execution upon a debt of this kind; and relates not at all to execution upon debts affecting land.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame paragraph, the author fir&s;t mentioned adds, That there was no more u&s;e for the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s after the &s;aid &s;tatute. This mu&s;t be a carele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion; for our author could not &s;eriou&s;ly be of this opinion. Execution upon per&s;onal debt af|ter this &s;tatute continued as formerly, ex|cept that as to tenants it was limited to their arrears including the current term.
<PB N="261" REF="271">
And with regard to the brieve of di&s;tre&s;s, con&s;idered as an authority from the King to judge of per&s;onal debt, there was a very different cau&s;e for its wearing out of u&s;e, which is, that judges took upon them to determine upon claims of per&s;onal debt, without any authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See as to this point, Tract VIII. Of brieves.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE mi&s;take commonly produceth ano|ther. Our author taking it for granted, that poinding upon <HI>debita fundi</HI> is regulated by the act 1469, as well as poinding upon per&s;onal debt, draws the following con&s;e|quence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book 4. Tit. 23. &sect; 8.</NOTE>, That there is a rever&s;ion of &s;even years when lands are appri&s;ed upon a <HI>debi|tum fundi,</HI> as well as when they are appri&s;ed upon a per&s;onal debt; ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that the exten&s;ion of the rever&s;ion to ten years, by the act 62. p. 1661, relates to the latter only, and that the former re|mains upon the footing of the act 1469. But it will be evident, from what is ju&s;t
<PB N="262" REF="272">
now &s;aid, that appri&s;ings upon <HI>debita fundi</HI> have no rever&s;ion as to land more than as to moveables; the act 1469, which intro|duced the privilege of a rever&s;ion, relating only to execution for payment of per&s;onal debt.</P>
<P>THIS author is again in a mi&s;take, when he lays down, That appri&s;ing of land upon a <HI>debitum fundi</HI> is laid a&s;ide, and that the land mu&s;t be adjudged by a proce&s;s before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book 4.

It is clear, that the act 1672, introducing adjudications, goes not one &s;tep farther, than to &s;ub&s;titute them in place of appri&s;ings for payment of per|&s;onal debt; and therefore, that execution upon a decree for poinding the ground, re|mains, to this day, upon its original footing.</P>

<P>CUJACIUS gives an accurate defi|nition of a feudal holding in the following words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Feudum e&s;t jus in praedio alieno, in perpetuum utendi, fruendi, quod pro beneficio dominus dat ea lege, ut qui accipit, &s;ibi fidem et militiae munus, aliudve &s;ervitium exhibeat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ad. lib. 1. feud.

<PB N="264" REF="274">
The feudal contract is di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, by the following circum&s;tance, That land is given for &s;ervice in place of wages in money. This contract at its fir&s;t dawn was limited to a time certain. It was after|wards made to &s;ub&s;i&s;t during the va&s;&s;al's life; and in progre&s;s of time was extended to the male i&s;&s;ue of the original va&s;&s;al. It was not the purpo&s;e of this contract to transfer the property, but only to give the va&s;&s;al the profits of the land during his &s;er|vice; or in other words, to give him the u&s;ufruct. To transfer the property would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the covenant; becau&s;e wages ought not to be perpetual, when the &s;ervice is but tempo|rary. Hence it nece&s;&s;arily followed, when the male i&s;&s;ue of the original va&s;&s;al, called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were exhau&s;ted, that the land returned to the &s;uperior, to be employ|ed by him, if he plea&s;ed, for procuring a new va&s;&s;al. And the ca&s;e behoved to be the &s;ame, when any of the&s;e heirs refu&s;ed in his cour&s;e to undertake the &s;ervice. Such
<PB N="265" REF="275">
being the nature and intendment of the feudal contract, it is evident, that while a feu was for life only, it was the &s;uperior's privilege as proprietor, without any forma|lity, to enter to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land upon the death of his va&s;&s;al. Nor was this privilege lo&s;t by making feus hereditary. Every heir hath a year to deliberate, whe|ther it will be his intere&s;t to undertake the &s;ervice. During this period, being entitled to no wages &s;ince he &s;ubmits not to the &s;er|vice, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and profits of the land mu&s;t of cour&s;e remain with the &s;uperior.

It is nece&s;&s;ary, from the very nature of the thing, that the &s;uperior, accepting his offer, &s;hould give orders to introduce him to the land; and this act is termed <HI>renovatio feudi.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is not the only ca&s;e, where the &s;u|perior is entitled to an <HI>interim</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A

<P>IT appears from our law-books, that the privilege be&s;towed upon heirs by the &s;tatute of Henry II. of continuing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ance&s;tors, obtained al&s;o in Scotland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 2. cap. 40. cap. 71. &sect; 1. Second &s;lat. Rob. I. cap. 6. &sect; 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>. This privilege made a great change in the form of feudal titles; and in particular, with re&s;pect to land held of a &s;ubject, &s;u|perceded totally the brieve of inque&s;t, and the con&s;equential &s;teps of &s;ervice and retour. For where an heir is privileged by law to continue, or apprehend at &s;hort hand the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tor, he has no occa|&s;ion
<PB N="274" REF="284">
for a &s;ervice and retour, of which the only purpo&s;e is to procure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We followed al&s;o the Engli&s;h law with re&s;pect to military tenures held of the King. The 2d &s;tatute Robert I. cap. 7. which is our authority, is copied almo&s;t <HI>verbatim</HI> from the &s;tatute of Henry III. above mentioned. But we did not re&s;t there; for we &s;ee from the &s;tatutes of Robert III.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 19, &amp; 38.</NOTE> that the old law was totally re&s;tored, entitling every &s;u|perior to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and leaving the heir to claim the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from his &s;uperior.</P>
<P>BUT the authority of the&s;e &s;tatutes was not &s;ufficient to &s;tem altogether the torrent of popular opinion. By this time, the proper|ty, in common apprehen&s;ion, was transferred from the &s;uperior to the va&s;&s;al; and after the va&s;&s;al's death, his heir, it was thought, had a better title than the &s;uperior to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the land. The general bia&s;s according|ly, in &s;pite of the&s;e &s;tatutes, continued in
<PB N="275" REF="285">
favour of the heirs po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and one cir|cum&s;tance undoubtedly contributed to give him the preference. A young man <HI>in fa|milia</HI> with his father, is con&s;idered as in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, even during his father's life; and after his father's death, there is no change with regard to him: he has no occa&s;ion to apprehend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: he remains or con|tinues in it, and cannot be thru&s;t out at &s;hort hand without &s;ome &s;ort of proce&s;s. Our forefathers, at the &s;ame time, in this favourite point, were not nice in di&s;tingui&s;h|ing betwixt heirs. If a &s;on <HI>in familia</HI> was entitled to continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was reckoned no wide &s;tretch, that a &s;on <HI>foris familiated</HI> &s;hould be entitled to &s;tep into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: nor was it reckoned a wide &s;tretch to communicate this privilege to other heirs, though le&s;s connected with the ance&s;tor. Thus, as to the mere right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the heir in Scotland has, for many centuries, been preferred before the &s;uperior. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, however, that this privilege, acquired by cu&s;tom, again&s;t the authority
<PB N="276" REF="286">
of &s;tatute-law, has not the effect to ve&s;t in the heir the property, or to give him a free|hold, as termed in England. This would be to overturn the &s;tatute altogether; which we have not attempted. The &s;tatute is &s;o far only encroached upon in practice, as to privilege the heir, at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to &s;tep into the void po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; re&s;erving the &s;uperior's privilege to turn the heir out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by a proper proce&s;s, unle&s;s the heir make up his title by a &s;ervice, and, in the regular method, demand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or &s;ei&s;in from the &s;uperior.</P>
<P>THE difference then betwixt our pre&s;ent practice, and what it was before the days of Henry II. appears to be what follows. The heir originally had no right to po&s;&s;e&s;s, till he was regularly entered by the &s;uperior. If the heir entered at his own hand, he was guilty of intru&s;ion, and could be &s;ummarily ejected. At pre&s;ent we con&s;ider, as origi|nally, the land to be the &s;uperior's property, and that the heir has not a freehold till he
<PB N="277" REF="287">
be regularly entered: but then we con&s;ider him as entitled, at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is lawful; and that the &s;uperior cannot turn him out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at &s;hort hand or by a &s;ummary ejection, but mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t in a regular proce&s;s of removing, after a declarator of non-entry is obtained.</P>
<P>FROM what is above laid down, it is evi|dent, that in no ca&s;e have we adopted the Engli&s;h maxim, <HI>Quod mortuus &s;a&s;it vivum.</HI> Formerly the Engli&s;h law, with regard to military tenures held of the crown, was the &s;ame with what obtains here in all tenures, <HI>viz.</HI> That the heir has no freehold, till he &s;ue out his livery, after a &s;ervice upon the brieve <HI>Diem clau&s;it &s;upremum,</HI> which corre|&s;pends to our brieve of inque&s;t. But now that in England military tenures are abo|li&s;hed, heirs require not &s;ervice and infeft|ment; the maxim holds univer&s;ally there as in France, <HI>Quod mortuus &s;a&s;it vivum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="288">
IT may be thought, at fir&s;t view, a very &s;light favour, to prefer the heir <HI>in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;orio,</HI> when it requires only a proce&s;s to thru&s;t him out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But not to mention, that he has a defence at hand, which is an offer to enter heir, it belongs more to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject to ob&s;erve, that this privilege of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is attended with very remarkable advantages, ari&s;ing from the bia&s;s of popular notions, to which the law hath &s;ubmitted. The &s;uperior is entitled to a year's rent in name of relief, or <HI>primer &s;ei&s;in</HI> as termed in England; and if the &s;uperior were entitled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, this relief would undoubtedly be the full rent. But by the heir's privilege of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the &s;uperior for the year's rent is reduced to a claim; and this claim, like all other ca&s;ual|ties of &s;uperiority, being unfavourable, is mea&s;ured by the new extent, which, by con|&s;truction of law, or rather of practice, is, in this ca&s;e, held to be the rent of the land. And the &s;ame rule is ob&s;erved in the claim of non-entry. This claim of non-entry is
<PB N="279" REF="289">
al&s;o founded upon the &s;uperior's legal privi|lege of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The rents claimed are under&s;tood to be the rents of the &s;uperior's land, levied by the heir without a title, and for which therefore he is bound to account. But the burden of accounting is made ea&s;y to him, the new extent being in this ca&s;e, as in the former, put for the real rent.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;carce one point in our law &s;o indi&s;tinctly handled by writers, and upon which there is &s;uch contrariety of deci&s;ions, as the following, What right an heir po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of his ance&s;tor's e&s;tate has to the rents, before he be infeft. In many ca&s;es it has been judged, that the rents are his, in the &s;ame manner as if he were regularly entered. In other ca&s;es, not fewer in num|ber, it has been judged, that tenants pay|ing their rents to him <HI>bona fide</HI> are &s;ecure; but that he has no legal claim to the rents, and therefore has no action again&s;t the te|nants to force them to pay. Pur&s;uant to the latter opinion, the growing rents, after
<PB N="280" REF="290">
the predece&s;&s;or's death, have been con&s;idered as a part or acce&s;&s;ory of the <HI>haereditas jacens,</HI> and therefore to be carried by an adjudica|tion deduced again&s;t the heir, upon a &s;pecial charge to enter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">13th February 1740, Dick&s;on of Kilbucho <HI>contra</HI> appa|rent heir of Poldean.</NOTE>: and yet it weighs on the other &s;ide, that an appri&s;ing upon a &s;pecial charge was never thought to carry bygone rents; for a good rea&s;on, which applies equally to an adjudication, <HI>viz.</HI> That an appri&s;ing upon a &s;pecial charge ought not to have a more exten&s;ive effect, than an ap|pri&s;ing at common law, deduced again&s;t the the heir after he is infeft, which a&s;&s;uredly doth not carry any arrears. To relieve us from this uncertainty, we mu&s;t &s;earch for &s;ome principle that may lead to a ju&s;t con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;uperior, during the heir's non-en|try, is undoubtedly proprietor of the land. Hence it follows, that, at common law, the rents belong to the &s;uperior, and that the heir
<PB N="281" REF="291">
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is liable to account to him for the rents. But our law, or rather our judges, indulging the general prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of the heir, have been long in u&s;e of limiting this claim to the new extent, which once having been the full rent of the land, is pre&s;umed to continue &s;o, in order to relieve the heir from a rigorous claim. What then is to become of the difference betwixt this &s;uppo&s;ed value of the rents, and what they extend to in reality? This difference mu&s;t undoubtedly accrue to the heir, becau&s;e it is, in effect, what he gains from the &s;uperior, by the favour of the law. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a declarator of non-entry is commenced, which entitles the &s;uperior, in equity as well as at common law, to the full rents; and that upon a tran&s;action with the heir, he accepts of the one half: the other half mu&s;t belong to the heir by this tran&s;|action. It ought to be the &s;ame before a declarator; for a legal compo&s;ition has the &s;ame effect with one that is voluntary. This rea&s;oning appears to be &s;olid; and therefore
<PB N="282" REF="292">
we need not he&s;itate to conclude, that the heir in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is entitled to levy the rents, in order to account for the &s;ame to the &s;u|perior. And indeed, without a circuit, the power of levying the rents may rea&s;onably be thought a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for without it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is a mere &s;hadow.</P>
<P>THIS point being e&s;tabli&s;hed, there no longer remains any dubiety. If the heir-apparent, &s;eizing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or continu|ing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ance&s;tor, has right to the rents without a formal entry, it fol|lows, that the&s;e rents are not to be con&s;i|dered as <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> of the ance&s;tor, to be carried by an adjudication upon a &s;pe|cial charge. On the contrary, they mu&s;t be attached as the property of the apparent heir, that is, by arre&s;tment. What of the&s;e rents remain in the hands of the tenants, without being levied by the heir-apparent, mu&s;t after his decea&s;e belong to his next of kin; and the next heir, though he com|pleat
<PB N="283" REF="293">
his right to the land by infeftment, will have no claim to the&s;e rents.</P>
<P>TO conclude; This is a curious branch of the hi&s;tory of the feudal law in Britain, and of a &s;ingular nature. The feudal law was a violent &s;y&s;tem, repugnant to natural principles. It was &s;ubmitted to in barba|rous times, when the exerci&s;e of arms was the only &s;cience, and the only commerce. It is repugnant to all the arts of peace, and when mankind came to affect &s;ecurity more than danger, nothing could make it tole|rable, but long u&s;age and inveterate habit. It behoved however to yield gradually, to the prevailing love of liberty and indepen|dency; and accordingly, through all Europe, it dwindled away gradually, and became a &s;hadow, before any branch of it was abro|gated by &s;tatute. When it was undermined by &s;o powerful a cau&s;e, we would have great rea&s;on to conjecture, that it could never recover any ground it had once lo&s;t: and yet here is a very &s;trong contrary in&s;tance,
<PB N="284" REF="294">
which mu&s;t have had &s;ome &s;ingular cau&s;e, that probably is now lo&s;t to us for ever; for we have no regular records of any antiqui|ty, and our ancient hi&s;torians &s;eldom take notice of civil tran&s;actions that have any re|lation to law.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF REGALITIES, and of the privilege of repledging.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the European nations who embraced the feudal &s;y&s;tem, it is remarkable, that the crown-va&s;&s;als ro&s;e gradually into power and &s;plendor, till they became an overmatch for the &s;overeign. It is &s;till more remarkable, that the &s;ame crown-va&s;&s;als, tho&s;e of Germany excepted, after attaining this height of power and &s;plendor, &s;unk by degrees, and at pre&s;ent
<PB N="286" REF="296">
are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ma&s;s of the peo|ple, by name more than by any &s;olid pre|eminence.</P>
<P>THE growing power of the crown-va&s;&s;als, may be ea&s;ily accounted for. It was plain|ly the re&s;ult of making feus hereditary. Experience di&s;covered, what might have been di&s;covered without experience, that to make the bread of a man's family depend upon his life, is apt to damp the brave&s;t &s;pirits. This engaged fir&s;t one prince and then another, to promi&s;e a renovation of the feu to the heir, if the va&s;&s;al &s;hould lo&s;e his life in battle, till the&s;e engagements be|came univer&s;al. The &s;overeigns in Europe, having no &s;tanding army, could not promi&s;e to carry on a war &s;ucce&s;sfully, without the good-will of their va&s;&s;als, to whom therefore it became nece&s;&s;ary to give all encourage|ment and indulgence. If one prince led the way, others behoved to follow. At length, no powers were to be with-held from the crown-va&s;&s;als, who were already become
<PB N="287" REF="297">
too powerful. In England, Palatinates were erected, exempted from the juri&s;diction of the King's judges, with power of coining money, levying war, &amp;c. In Scotland, Re|galities were created with the highe&s;t civil and criminal juri&s;diction, and with all other powers annexed to Palatinates in England.</P>
<P>WHETHER regalities originally were ex|empted from the juri&s;diction of the King's judges, is uncertain. I incline to think they were not; at lea&s;t, that it has been a matter of doubt. For there are &s;everal in&s;tances of grants by the King to Lords of regality, exempting them from the juri&s;diction of the King's judges. One in&s;tance I have at hand. There is a charter by king Robert II. to his brother James de Dougla&s;s de Dalkeith, knight of the baronies of Dalkeith, Calder|cleer, Kinclaven, &amp;c. to be held in one en|tire and free barony, and in free regality, with the four pleas of the crown. This charter is in the 16th year of the King's reign, &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the 1386. And
<PB N="288" REF="298">
in the year immediately following, there is a grant under the Great Seal to the &s;ame James de Dougla&s;s, reciting the &s;aid charter, and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"di&s;charging all the King's ju&s;ticiars, &s;heriffs, and their mini&s;ters, from all in|tromi&s;&s;ion and admini&s;tration of their offices within the &s;aid lands."</Q> Such a grant, it may be thought, was unnece&s;&s;ary, if the Lords of regality enjoyed this privi|lege by the common law. However this be, it appears by indenture betwixt king Ro|bert I. and his parliament 1326, authori&s;ing a tax to be levied for the King's u&s;e during his life, that many of the great Lords enjoy|ed the fore&s;aid privilege. For this indenture goes upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the King's officers could not act within regalities: and therefore, the&s;e Lords take upon them&s;elves, to levy what part of the tax was laid upon their lands, and to pay the &s;ame to the King's officers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this indenture in the Appendix, N^o. 4.</NOTE>. And this exclu&s;ive privilege, in whatever manner introduced, came to be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in Lords of regality, as will
<PB N="289" REF="299">
appear from the act 5. p. 1440, and act 26. p. 1449; the former regulating the ju&s;tice airs on the north and &s;outh &s;ides of the Scotch &s;ea; and, with the &s;ame breath, ap|pointing Lords of regality to hold ju&s;tice airs within their regalities: the latter ap|pointing regalities to be &s;ubjected to the King's ju&s;tice, while they remain in the King's hands.</P>
<P>AND here, by the way, it may be remark|ed, that the act 43. p. 1455, is no &s;light in&s;tance of the authority of the great ba|rons. Tho&s;e who had obtained regalities, were fond to engro&s;s to them&s;elves the power and privileges depending thereon; and to prevent future rival&s;hip, they exerted their power, to wre&s;t from the crown one capital branch of its prerogative, that of erecting regalities. They &s;ucceeded in their enter|pri&s;e, and obtained the &s;aid act, declaring, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That in time coming no regalities be granted without deliverance of parlia|ment;"</Q> that is, without con&s;ent of the
<PB N="290" REF="300">
Lords who had already obtained regalities; for in them was centered the power of the parliament. The circum&s;tances of the&s;e times readily unfold the political view of this &s;ta|tute; for the publick good is a motive of no great influence in rude ages. In Scot|land, the great families, by monopolizing the higher powers and privileges, &s;ecured to them|&s;elves dignity and authority. In England, the &s;ame &s;pirit procured the &s;tatute <HI>de donis conditionalibus,</HI> which, by the power of mak|ing entails, and attaching unalienably a great e&s;tate to a great family, laid a &s;till more &s;olid foundation for dignity and authority.</P>
<P>THE downfal of the&s;e great families was occa&s;ioned by circum&s;tances more complex. The&s;e are many in number, but the chief appear to be, the transference of property from the &s;uperior to the va&s;&s;al, the free commerce of land, and the firm e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the right of primogeniture. With re&s;pect to the two circum&s;tances fir&s;t men|tioned, it is a maxim in politics, That
<PB N="291" REF="301">
power, in a good mea&s;ure, depends on pro|perty. The great Lords behoved originally to have great power, becau&s;e their va&s;&s;als had the u&s;e only of the lands they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, not the property. But popular notions pre|vailing over &s;trict law, the va&s;&s;al came by degrees to be con&s;idered as proprietor, and law accommodated it&s;elf to popular notions. And thus the property of the feudal &s;ubject was imperceptibly transferred from the &s;u|perior to his va&s;&s;al, which made the latter in a good mea&s;ure independent. The free commerce of land, repugnant to the genius of the feudal law, brought the great Lords lower and lower. Peace and commerce af|forded money and introduced luxury. The grandees, de&s;pi&s;ing the frugality of their an|ce&s;tors, could no longer confine their ex|pences within their yearly income. They were obliged to di&s;po&s;e of land for payment of their debts; and the indu&s;trious, who had money, were fond to purcha&s;e land, which, for the &s;ake of independency, they cho&s;e to hold of the crown. Thus by mul|tiplying
<PB N="292" REF="302">
the crown-va&s;&s;als without end, their connection was broke, and their power re|duced to nothing.</P>
<P>WHILE the crown-va&s;&s;als were declining, the crown was gaining ground daily by the privilege of primogeniture. To explain this circum&s;tance, for it requires explana|tion, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that, in matter of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, primogeniture has no privilege by the law of nature. And though a crown may be an exception, where the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is confined to a &s;ingle per&s;on; yet primoge|niture in this ca&s;e, cannot take fa&s;t hold of the mind, in oppo&s;ition to the general rule of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which, in private e&s;tates, be|&s;tows an equal right on all the males. We &s;ee a notable example of this in Turky, where primogeniture has no privilege, ex|cept with regard to the imperial dignity. Influenced by the general rule of an equal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the younger &s;ons of the Emperor con&s;ider them&s;elves to be upon a level with the fir&s;t-born; and that their title to the
<PB N="293" REF="303">
empire is not inferior to his title. By this means, where one is preferred by will, or the elde&s;t where there is no will, the other &s;ons are apt to pronounce it an act of inju&s;tice, depriving them of their birthright. Hence perpetual jealou&s;ies and civil di&s;cord, which commonly terminate in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of one of the &s;ons, at the expence of the lives of his brethren. And con&s;idering the matter impartially, this is le&s;s the effect of brutal manners, than of an infirm political con&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IT was a regulation in Per&s;ia, that the King behoved to name his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, if he cho&s;e to make war in per&s;on. Da|rius had three &s;ons by the daughter of Gobryas, his fir&s;t wife; all born before he was king. After his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, he had four more by Ato&s;&s;a, the daughter of Cyrus. Of the former, Artabazanes was the elde&s;t: of the latter, Xerxes: and the&s;e two were competitors for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Artaba|zanes urged, that he was the elde&s;t of all the &s;ons of Darius, and that, by the cu&s;tom of all nations, the elde&s;t &s;on has a right to the crown. On the other hand, it was urged by Xerxes, that he was the &s;on of Ato&s;&s;a, the daughter of Cyrus, who had delivered the Per&s;ians from &s;ervitude, and that he was born after Darius was king; whereas Artabazanes was only the &s;on of Darius a private man. The&s;e rea&s;ons appeared &s;o ju&s;t, that Xerxes was declared the &s;ucce&s;&s;or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, Book 7.</NOTE>. The pri|vilege of primogeniture could not be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in Per&s;ia, when it gave way to &s;uch trivial circum&s;tances.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="304">
FROM the hi&s;tory of Europe we learn, that in the de&s;cent of the crown, hereditary right was of old little regarded: and this is not wonderful, con&s;idering, that till the feu|dal law was e&s;tabli&s;hed, primogeniture did not be&s;tow any privilege in point of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion. The feudal &s;y&s;tem, by confining to a &s;ingle heir the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the feudal &s;ub|ject, made way for the elde&s;t &s;on. Then it was, and no &s;ooner, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and to private e&s;tates, were go|verned by the &s;ame rules; which gave force to the right of primogeniture, as if it were a law of nature. This however was a work of time; and, after introduction of feus, it required many ages to obliterate former no|tions, and to give that preference to primo|geniture which now is never called in que&s;|tion. By this means it happened, that while the crown-va&s;&s;als were in the meridian of power, kings had very little authority. Being indebted for their advancement to the will of the people more than to the privilege of blood, they were little better than elective
<PB N="295" REF="305">
monarchs. But from the time that primo|geniture came to be a general law in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion, the European princes, depending now no longer on the choice of their people, ac|quired by degrees that extent of power, which naturally belongs to a hereditary monarch. The crown-va&s;&s;als at the &s;ame time gra|dually declining by the commerce of land, and by the transference of their property to their va&s;&s;als, are reduced within pro|per bounds, and have now no power but what tends to &s;upport a monarchial govern|ment.</P>
<P>GERMANY is in a &s;ingular ca&s;e. Com|po&s;ed of many great parts, which were never &s;olidly united under one government, or un|der one Royal family, it fluctuated many centuries betwixt hereditary and elective mo|narchy. This &s;erving to increa&s;e the power of the great Lords, the monarchy was re|duced to be purely elective. The electors became &s;overeign princes, and the power of the emperor is almo&s;t annihilated.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="306">
THE juri&s;diction of the crown-va&s;&s;als, comparing the pre&s;ent with former times, is a beautiful example of this gradual de|cline. With the power and dominion of the great Lords, their juri&s;diction &s;unk in proportion. What they lo&s;t on the one hand, was on the other acquired by the King and his judges; and at pre&s;ent, with the other privileges of crown-va&s;&s;als, their juri&s;diction is reduced to an empty name. The extent of this juri&s;diction in its diffe|rent periods, and its gradual decline, being chiefly the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make a large circuit, in order to &s;et the matter in its proper light.</P>
<P>As no branch of publick police is of greater importance, than that of di&s;tribut|ing ju&s;tice, it is nece&s;&s;ary to this end, that the juri&s;diction of every judge be a&s;certain|ed, with re&s;pect to cau&s;es as well as per|&s;ons. Concerning the latter, a plain and commodious rule is e&s;tabli&s;hed, through mo&s;t civilized nations. The kingdom is
<PB N="297" REF="307">
divided into di&s;tricts, and in each, a judge is appointed who has under his juri&s;diction the people re&s;iding in his di&s;trict. Thus, with regard to juri&s;diction, the people are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their place of re&s;idence, which &s;o far regulates the powers of the &s;e|veral judges. And were it po&s;&s;ible to di|&s;tingui&s;h cau&s;es by a rule equally preci&s;e, di&s;putes among judges about their juri&s;dic|tions would &s;carce ever occur.</P>
<P>BUT this in&s;titution is the re&s;ult of an improved police: our notions of juri&s;diction were originally different, and behoved to be different. Before agriculture was in|vented, people in a good mea&s;ure depended on their cattle for &s;u&s;tenance. In the&s;e early times, the few inhabitants that were in a country, being cla&s;&s;ed in tribes or clans, led a wandering life from place to place, for the convenience of pa&s;ture. Every clan or tribe had a head, who was their general in war, and their judge in peace. And thus every chieftain was the judge over his own people,
<PB N="298" REF="308">
without regard to territory, which, in a wan|dering &s;tate, could not be of any con&s;idera|tion. After the invention of agriculture which fixed a clan to a certain &s;pot, the &s;ame principle prevailed, and neighbouring clans, to prevent di&s;putes about juri&s;diction, &s;ettled upon the following regulation, That the people of each clan, wherever found, &s;hould be judged by their own chieftain.</P>
<P>DURING the third and fourth centuries, we find this regulation &s;teadily ob&s;erved in France, after it was de&s;erted by the Romans and abandoned to the Barbarians. It was an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule among the Burgundians, Franks, Goths, and ancient inhabitants, that each people &s;hould be governed by their own laws, and by their own judges; even after they were intermixed by marriages and commerce. Nor was this an incommodious in&s;titution, in a country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by nations or clans, differing in their language, differ|ing in their laws, and differing in their man|ners. There can be no doubt, that the
<PB N="299" REF="309">
&s;ame practice prevailed in this country, both before and after our &s;everal tribes or clans were united under one general head. The laws of the different clans have been dige&s;ted into one general law, known by the name of <HI>The Common Law of Scotland;</HI> but the chief|tains privilege of judging his own people, continued long in force, and traces of it re|main to this day. Clans were di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, &s;o as to prevent any con|fu&s;ion in exerci&s;ing the privilege. Clans of|ten differed in their language, or in their dre&s;s; and when the&s;e differences were not found, tho&s;e who lived together, and pa&s;tur|ed in common, were reckoned to be of one clan. After agriculture was introduced, clans were di&s;tingui&s;hed, partly by a com|mon name, and partly by living within a certain territory.</P>
<P>THIS juri&s;diction was favoured by the feudal law, which made an additional bond of union betwixt the chieftain and his people, by the relation of &s;uperior and va&s;&s;al. And
<PB N="300" REF="310">
the juri&s;diction being thereby connected with land-property, is, with re&s;pect to the title, termed territorial juri&s;diction; though, with re&s;pect to its exerci&s;e it is per&s;onal, without relation to territory. On the other hand, juri&s;diction granted by the crown to per|&s;ons or families, without relation to land|property, &s;uch as an heretable ju&s;ticiary or an heretable &s;heriffship, is per&s;onal with re|&s;pect to the title, but territorial with re&s;pect to its exerci&s;e. The fir&s;t barons were no doubt the chieftains of clans, and the right of juri&s;diction &s;pecified in the charters of creation, mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as an ori|ginal juri&s;diction flowing from the King, but as the juri&s;diction which the&s;e chieftains enjoyed from the beginning over their own people. In imitation of the&s;e fir&s;t barons, every man who got his lands erected into a barony, was con&s;idered as a chieftain, or the head of a clan; and the juri&s;diction confer|red upon him, though depending entirely upon the grant, was, by the connection of ideas, con&s;idered notwith&s;tanding to be the
<PB N="301" REF="311">
&s;ame that belonged originally to chieftains. And hence it is, that the&s;e territorial judges had the power of reclaiming their own peo|ple from other judges, and judging them in their own courts.</P>
<P>UPON the &s;ame principle, the Royal bur|rows had the power of reclaiming their own burge&s;&s;es, not only from territorial judges, but even from the King's judges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leg. Burg. cap. 61.</NOTE>. Pleas of the crown were excepted; becau&s;e the Royal burrows had no juri&s;diction in &s;uch crimes<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. cap. 7.</NOTE>. And here it mu&s;t be remarked, that Royal burrows had a peculiar privi|lege, nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving peace among their people, that in proce&s;&s;es again&s;t &s;trang|ers before the baillies, for riots or breach of the peace committed within the town, re|claiming to the Lord's court was not ad|mitted<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t &s;tat. Rob. I. cap. 16. &sect; 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT among a rude people, delighting in war, where the authority of the chieftain
<PB N="302" REF="312">
depends upon the good-will of his clan, this privilege was often exerted to protect crimi|nals, in&s;tead of being exerted to bring them to ju&s;tice. Endeavours were early u&s;ed to correct this corrupt practice, by enacting, That chieftains or barons &s;hould be bound, to give a pledge or &s;urety in the court where the criminal is attached, to do ju|&s;tice upon him in the Lord's own court within year and day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quon. attach. cap. 8.</NOTE>: and from this time, upon account of the pledge or &s;urety given, the privilege of reclaiming obtained the name of repledging.</P>
<P>THIS regulation, though a wi&s;e and u&s;e|ful precaution, proved however but an im|perfect remedy. Nor was better to be ex|pected; for the privilege of repledging was an unnatural excre&s;cence in the body po|litick, which admitted of no effectual cure, other than amputation. The &s;tatutes of Alexander II. cap. 4. are evidence, that the power of repledging was pro&s;tituted in a
<PB N="303" REF="313">
vile manner, not only to protect the Lord's own men from ju&s;tice, but al&s;o to protect others for hire; and accordingly by that &s;tatute, and by the fir&s;t &s;tatutes Robert I. cap. 10. the power of repledging is confined within narrower bounds than formerly. But this power, after all the limitations impo&s;ed, being found &s;till prejudicial to the common intere&s;t, an attack was prudently made upon it, in its weake&s;t part, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Royal burrows, which produced the act 1. p. 1488. ordaining burge&s;&s;es to &s;ubmit to trial in the ju&s;tice air, without power of repledging. And to make this new regulation palatable, it was made the duty of the King's ju&s;tice, to give an a&s;&s;ize to a burge&s;s of his own neighbours, if a &s;ufficient number were pre|&s;ent in court.</P>
<P>FROM what is &s;aid above, there can be no doubt, that barons had a power of re|pledging from the King's courts, as well as from each other. The privilege, however, was of no great moment; becau&s;e every
<PB N="304" REF="314">
partial judgment of the baron, in favour of any of his own people, lay open to imme|diate redre&s;s, by an appeal to the King's court. An appeal lay even to the &s;heriff again&s;t every &s;entence pronounced in the baron-court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 1. cap. 3.</NOTE>. In this re&s;pect, the power of repledging, which the Lords of regality enjoyed, was a privilege of much greater moment; becau&s;e from a court of regality there lay no appeal but to the parliament.</P>
<P>LORDS of regality had undoubtedly the power of repledging, when their people were apprehended out of their territory, and brought before another court. Properly &s;peaking, this is the only ca&s;e in which there was occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e the privilege. For their juri&s;diction being exclu&s;ive even of the King's courts, as appears from what is mentioned above, they could have no oc|ca&s;ion to repledge their people, apprehended within their own territory by the authority of any extraneous judge; becau&s;e &s;uch at|tachment
<PB N="305" REF="315">
was illegal, and a proper decli|nator lay.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t manife&s;t &s;ymptom of the de|clining power of the crown-va&s;&s;als, was the exten&s;ion of the juri&s;diction of the King's judges over regalities, &s;o as to produce a cumulative juri&s;diction. As this privilege was introduced by practice, and not by &s;ta|tute, the encroachment was gradual, one in&s;tance following another, till the privilege was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. It is probable, that the above mentioned power of repledging, &s;o well known in the practice of Scotland, paved the way to this encroachment. For among a rude people, un&s;killed in the re|finements of law, the encroachment would &s;carce be perceived, &s;o long as the &s;ub&s;tan|tial prerogative remained with the chief|tains, <HI>viz.</HI> that of judging their own people. And whether this exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction was maintained by a proper declinator, or by the power of repledging; would be reckoned a mere <HI>punctilio.</HI> The people of a regality,
<PB N="306" REF="316">
originally exempted from all juri&s;diction &s;ave that of their own lord, were thus imperceptibly &s;ubjected al&s;o to the King's courts. But &s;till a regality being co-ordi|nate with the King's &s;upreme courts, its de|crees continued, as formerly, to be &s;ubjected to no review, except in parliament.</P>
<P>BY the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, which is the &s;upreme court in civil matters, the regality-courts were rendered &s;o far &s;ubordinate. But in matters crimi|nal, the juri&s;diction, as co-ordinate with that of the ju&s;ticiary court, was pre&s;erved entire, together with the power of repledg|ing even from that court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Skene de verb. &s;ignif. Tit. (Iter) &sect; 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE royal authority with that of the &s;overeign courts, gaining a firm e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, annihilated the baron's power of re|pledging. But the Lords of regality did not &s;o readily &s;uccumb under the weight of an enlarged prerogative; and though their
<PB N="307" REF="317">
privileges were in a great mea&s;ure incompa|tible with the growing power of the crown, as well as with the orderly admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; yet &s;uch was their influence in par|liament, that the attempt to rob them of their privileges by an expre&s;s law, was found not advi&s;eable. It was more prudent, to lie in wait for favourable opportunities, to a|bridge the&s;e privileges by degrees. The fir&s;t opportunity that offered, re&s;pected church-regalities, annexed to the crown after the reformation. The heretable baillies of the&s;e regalities, being an incon&s;iderable body and in a &s;ingular ca&s;e, it was not difficult to ob|tain a &s;tatute again&s;t them. And accord|ingly, though their power of repledging from the &s;heriff, both in civil and criminal matters, was re&s;erved entire, yet it was enacted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 29. p. 1587.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That they &s;hould have no power of repledging from the court of ju&s;ticiary, except in the ca&s;e of pre|vention by the fir&s;t citation:"</Q> which was abrogating their privilege of repledg|ing from the ju&s;ticiary court. This being
<PB N="308" REF="318">
a direct attack upon regality-privileges, though in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;gui&s;ed, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;often its har&s;hne&s;s; which was done by &s;ub&s;tituting, in place of the power of repledging, a privilege in appear|ance greater, but in effect a mere &s;hadow. It was, that the heretable baillie might &s;it with the King's ju&s;tice, and judge with him, and, upon conviction, receive a proportion of the e&s;cheat.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tatute paved the way for abridg|ing the privileges of laick-regalities; as any handle is &s;ufficient again&s;t a declining power. The &s;peciality in the &s;tatute was forgot, or not regarded, and it was ex|tended again&s;t all regalities of whatever &s;ort. The privilege of repledging was how|ever kept alive, though it wore fainter and fainter every day; and at the long-run was indulged for fifteen days only, after the crime was committed. This we learn from the &s;tatutes appointing ju&s;ticiars in the Highlands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 39. P. 1693, act 37. P. 1695, and, act 8. P. 170<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, in which the rights and
<PB N="309" REF="319">
juri&s;diction of Lords of regality are re&s;erv|ed, and particularly <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their right of preven|tion for fifteen days;"</Q> importing, That if the per&s;on was cited before the ju&s;tice court within fifteen days of committing the al|ledged crime, the Lord of regality might repledge; for if he was the fir&s;t attacher, even after the fifteen days, it cannot be doubted, that, of common right, he had the exclu&s;ive privilege of proceeding in the trial, and of pa&s;&s;ing a definitive &s;entence.</P>

But as the regality-court had by this time lo&s;t all its original authority, its privileges were little regarded. The judges of the court of ju&s;ticiary gradually increa&s;ing in power and dignity, heightned by contra&s;ting them with regality baillies, gave regality courts a &s;evere blow, <HI>anno</HI> 1730, by admitting an advocation from the

an inferior juri&s;diction only, and not co|ordinate with the court of ju&s;ticiary."</Q> This judgment did not re&s;t upon any limita|tion in the Earl's right, which was granted by parliament in the mo&s;t ample terms; but upon the following ground, That the court of ju&s;ticiary, as con&s;tituted by act 1672, is the &s;upreme court in criminal, as the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is in civil matters, which, of con&s;equence, mu&s;t render all heretable ju|ri&s;dictions &s;ubordinate; courts of ju&s;ticiary as well as courts of regality. But though the act 1672 was called in aid to &s;upport this inference, yet there is not in that &s;tatute, a &s;ingle clau&s;e which &s;o much as hints at a greater power in the court of ju&s;ticiary than it formerly enjoyed. And this &s;ugge&s;ts a reflection, which is curious, and appears to be ju&s;t, That the rea&s;on profe&s;&s;ed and &s;poke out, is not always that which produces the judgment, but perhaps &s;ome latent circum|&s;tance operating upon the mind impercep|tibly. Thus, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the act 1672, was the profe&s;&s;ed cau&s;e of the judg|ment; though, in all probability, what at
<PB N="312" REF="322">
bottom moved the judges, was a very diffe|rent con&s;ideration. The new form which the court of ju&s;ticiary received, by &s;ub&s;titut|ing five lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion as perpetual mem|bers, in place of ju&s;tice-deputes who were ambulatory, be&s;towed a dignity upon this court, to which it was formerly a &s;tranger. This circum&s;tance, joined with the growing power of the crown, which readily commu|nicates it&s;elf to the mini&s;ters of the crown, advanced this court to a degree of &s;plendor, that quite ob&s;cured baillies of regality. We have rea&s;on to believe, that this ele|vation of the court of ju&s;ticiary, touching the mind imperceptibly, was really what in|fluenced the judges. For it is extremely difficult to &s;upport an equality of juri&s;dic|tion in two courts, that are &s;o unequal in all other re&s;pects. And thus, by natural cau&s;es which govern all human affairs, ter|ritorial juri&s;diction in Scotland was reduced to a mere &s;hadow; which made it be e&s;teem|ed no har&s;h mea&s;ure, to aboli&s;h it altogether by &s;tatute.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF COURTS.</HEAD>
<P>IN mo&s;t countries originally, the inhabi|tants were collected into clans or tribes, governed each by a chieftain, in whom were accumulated the &s;everal offices of ge|neral, magi&s;trate, and judge. The&s;e clans or tribes, for a long cour&s;e of time, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted perfectly di&s;tinct from each other, without any connection or intercour&s;e among indi|viduals of different clans. The invention of agriculture, extending connections beyond the clan, had a tendency to blend different
<PB N="314" REF="324">
clans together. Individuals of different clans, came to be more and more blended by inter|marriages, and con&s;equently by blood. Com|merce aro&s;e, and united under its wings, not only di&s;tant individuals, but different nati|ons. The clan-connection gave way by de|grees; and no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in any civilized country, being lo&s;t in the more extended connections that have no relation to clan|&s;hip.</P>
<P>THIS change of connection among indi|viduals, introduced a change in juri&s;diction. After clans were di&s;&s;olved, and individuals were left free to their private connections, the juri&s;diction of the chieftain could no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t. In place of it, judges were appointed, to exerci&s;e juri&s;diction in diffe|rent cau&s;es, and in different territories.</P>
<P>IN a very narrow &s;tate, one judge perhaps may be &s;ufficient to determine all matters that are in controver&s;y: but this cannot be, where the &s;tate is of any extent. Many
<PB N="315" REF="325">
judges, in that ca&s;e, are required for an accurate and expeditious di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice. If there mu&s;t be a number, it is bet|ter to di&s;tribute among them the different branches of law, than to give each of them a juri&s;diction in controver&s;ies of whatever kind. It is here as in a manufacture. An artificer confined to one branch, becomes more expert, than where he is employed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in many. But in law, this re|gulation hath its limits. Courts may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into civil, criminal, and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical; but more minute divi&s;ions would be inconvenient, becau&s;e the boundaries could not be accurately a&s;certained.</P>
<P>FOR the rea&s;on now given, it becomes al&s;o proper in an exten&s;ive &s;ociety, to be&s;tow the &s;ame powers upon a plurality of judges, who pre&s;ide over different territories, and who&s;e juri&s;dictions accordingly are &s;epa|rated from each other, in the di&s;tincte&s;t manner, by the natural marches and boun|daries of di&s;tricts or provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="326">
BUT judges &s;ubjected to no review, &s;oon become arbitrary. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uperior courts, to review the proceedings of tho&s;e that are inferior. Where the &s;uperior court is a court of appeal only, it has no regular continuance, and is never convened but when there is occa&s;ion. This was for|merly the ca&s;e in Scotland, as we &s;hall &s;ee by and by. It is an improvement to make this court perform, not only the duty of a court of appeal, but al&s;o that of an original court. In this ca&s;e, it mu&s;t have &s;tated times of &s;it|ting and acting, commonly called terms. And &s;uch is the pre&s;ent condition of the &s;u|perior courts in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations lead us to di&s;tin|gui&s;h courts into their different kinds. In the fir&s;t place, Courts are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the nature of the cau&s;es appropriated to each. They are either civil, criminal, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical. This is the primary boun|dary, which &s;eparates the juri&s;diction of one court from that of another.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="327">
THE next boundary is territory. Courts of the &s;ame rank, which judge the &s;ame cau&s;es, are &s;eparated from each other by a local juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>COURTS &s;uperior and inferior which judge the &s;ame cau&s;es, admit not of any local di&s;tinction; becau&s;e a court &s;uperior or &s;upreme has a juri&s;diction that extends over the &s;everal territories of many inferior courts. In this ca&s;e, there can be no &s;epara|tion, other than the fir&s;t citation.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e, there is generally in well regulated &s;tates, a court of a peculiar con|&s;titution, that has no original juri&s;diction, but is e&s;tabli&s;hed as a court in the la&s;t re|&s;ort, to review the proceedings of all other courts. This may be properly called a court of appeal; and &s;uch is the con&s;titu|tion of the hou&s;e of Lords in Britain.</P>
<P>IN the order here laid down, I proceed to examine the peculiar con&s;titutions of the
<PB N="318" REF="328">
courts in this country. And fir&s;t, of the difference of juri&s;diction with regard to cau&s;es. A man may be hurt in his goods, in his per&s;on, or in his character. The fir&s;t is redre&s;&s;ed in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and o|ther inferior civil courts; the &s;econd in the criminal court; and the third in the com|mi&s;&s;ary court. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the court of exchequer is e&s;tabli&s;hed, for managing &s;ub|jects, and making effectual claims, belonging to the crown. The court of admiralty has an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction, at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, in all maritime and &s;ea-faring cau&s;es, foreign and dome&s;tic, whether civil or criminal, and over all per&s;ons within this realm, as concerned in the &s;ame. There are al&s;o, by expre&s;s &s;tatutes, many particular juri&s;|dictions e&s;tabli&s;hed with re&s;pect to certain cau&s;es, which mu&s;t be tried by the judges appointed, and by none other.</P>
<P>THE court of &s;e&s;&s;ion hath an original juri&s;diction in matters of property, and in every thing which comes under the notion
<PB N="319" REF="329">
of pecuniary intere&s;t. But this court hath not an original juri&s;diction in matters of rank and precedency, nor in bearing arms. Controver&s;ies of this kind belong to the juri&s;diction of the Lord Lyon. To deter|mine a right of peerage, is the exclu&s;ive privilege of the hou&s;e of Lords. Nor has the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion an original juri&s;diction, with re&s;pect to the qualifications of tho&s;e who elect or are elected members of par|liament. The rea&s;on is, that none of the foregoing claims make a pecuniary intere&s;t. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, therefore, a&s;&s;umed a juri&s;diction which they had not, when they &s;u&s;tained them&s;elves judges, in the di&s;pute of precedency betwixt the Earls of Crawfurd and Sutherland. It was a &s;till bolder &s;tep, to &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves judges in the que&s;tion of the peerage of Lord Oliphant, mention|ed in Durie's deci&s;ions; and in the que|&s;tion of the peerage of Lovat, decided a few years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="330">
THE matters now mentioned, are obvi|ou&s;ly not comprehended under the ordinary juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the court had no occa&s;ion to a&s;&s;ume extraordi|nary powers, when, by our law, a different method is e&s;tabli&s;hed for determining &s;uch controver&s;ies. But what &s;hall we &s;ay of wrongs, where no remedy is provided? Many in&s;tances of this kind may be figured, which, having no relation to pecuniary intere&s;t, come not regularly under the cognizance of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The freeholders of a &s;hire, for example, in order to di&s;appoint one who claims to be inrolled, forbear to meet at the Michaelmas Head-court. This is a wrong, for which no remedy is provided by law; and yet our judges, confining them|&s;elves within their ordinary juri&s;diction, refu&s;ed to interpo&s;e in behalf of a free|holder who had &s;uffered this wrong, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the complaint as incompetent before them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">20th December 1753, Mackenzie of Highfield <HI>contra</HI> freeholders of the &s;hire of Cromarty.</NOTE>. Con&s;idering this ca&s;e attentively,
<PB N="321" REF="331">
it may be ju&s;tly doubted, whether &s;uch con|fined notions, with re&s;pect to the powers of a &s;upreme court, be not too &s;crupulous. No defect in the con&s;titution of a &s;tate de&s;erves greater reproach, than the giving licence to wrong without affording redre&s;s. Upon this account, it is the province, one &s;hould ima|gine, of the Sovereign and &s;upreme court, to redre&s;s wrongs of all &s;orts, where a pecu|liar remedy is not provided. Under the cognizance of the privy-council in Scotland, came many injuries, which, by the aboli|tion of that court, are left without any pe|culiar remedy; and the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion have been forced to li&s;ten to complaints of va|rious kinds, which belonged properly to the privy-council while it had a being. A new branch of juri&s;diction is thus &s;prung up in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, which daily increa&s;ing by new matter, will probably in time pro|duce a general maxim, That it is the pro|vince of this court, to redre&s;s all wrongs for which no other remedy is provided. We are however as yet far from being ripe for
<PB N="322" REF="332">
adopting this maxim. The utility of it is indeed perceived, but perceived too ob&s;cure|ly, to have any &s;teady influence on the prac|tice of the court. And for that rea&s;on our deci&s;ions upon this &s;ubject are far from be|ing uniform. In the foregoing ca&s;e of the freeholders of Cromarty, we have one in|&s;tance where the court would not venture beyond their ordinary limits; though there|by a palpable wrong was left without a re|medy. I &s;hall mention another in&s;tance, equally with the former beyond the ordi|nary juri&s;diction of the court, where the judges ventured to give redre&s;s. A &s;mall land-e&s;tate, con&s;i&s;ting of many parcels, hou&s;es, acres, &amp;c. was &s;plit among a num|ber of purcha&s;ers, who in a body petitioned the commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;upply, to divide the valuation among them, in order to have it a&s;certained what part of the land-tax each &s;hould pay. The commi&s;&s;ioners, unwilling to &s;plit the land-tax into &s;o &s;mall parts, re|fu&s;ed the petition. Upon a complaint to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the commi&s;|&s;ioners,
<PB N="323" REF="333">
the conveener was appointed to call a general meeting, in order to divide the valuation among the complainers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">4th Augu&s;t 1757, Malcolm and others <HI>contra</HI> commi&s;&s;i|oners of &s;upply for the &s;tewartry of Kircudbright.</NOTE>. This was not even a matter of judgment, but of pure authority, a&s;&s;umed from the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing, there being no other remedy provided; for otherwi&s;e the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion hath not by its con&s;titution any authority over the commi&s;&s;ioners of &s;upply. A wrong done by the commi&s;&s;ioners, in lay|ing a greater proportion of the land-tax up|on a proprietor of land than belongs to him, may be rectified by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as the &s;upreme court in pecuniary matters: but this court has no regular authority over the commi&s;&s;ioners, to direct their proceedings before hand.</P>
<P>UPON a new &s;ubject, not moulded into any form, nor re&s;olved into any principle, men are apt to judge by &s;entiment more than by general rules; and for that rea&s;on,
<PB N="324" REF="334">
the fluctuation, or even oppo&s;ition, of judg|ments upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, is not wonderful. This is peculiarly the ca&s;e of the &s;ubject under con&s;ideration: for be&s;ides its novelty, it is re&s;olvable into a matter of publick po|lice; which admitting many views, not le&s;s various than intricate, occa&s;ions much dif|ficulty in the law que&s;tions that depend on it. Such difficulties however are not in&s;uperable. Matters of law are ripened in the be&s;t manner, by warmth of debate at the bar, and coolne&s;s of judgment on the bench; and after many &s;ucce&s;sful experi|ments of a bold interpo&s;ition for the publick good, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion will clearly per|ceive the utility, of extending their juri&s;dic|tion to every &s;ort of wrong, where the per|&s;ons injured have no other means of obtain|ing reparation.</P>
<P>THIS extraordinary power of redre&s;&s;ing wrongs, &s;o far from a novelty, has a name appropriated to it in the language of our law. For what el&s;e can be meant by the
<PB N="325" REF="335">
<HI>nobile officium</HI> of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o much talked of and &s;o little under&s;tood? The only que&s;tion is, How far this extraor|dinary juri&s;diction or <HI>nobile officium,</HI> is, or ought to be, extended? The juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court of common law, is confined to matters of pecuniary in|tere&s;t; and it po&s;&s;ibly may be thought, that its extraordinary juri&s;diction ought to be confined within the &s;ame bounds. Such is the ca&s;e of the court of exchequer; for its extraordinary or equitable powers, reach no farther than to rectify the common law, &s;o far as relates to the &s;ubjects which come un|der its juri&s;diction as a court of common law. But the power to redre&s;s wrongs of all kinds, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;omewhere in every &s;tate; and in Scotland &s;ub&s;i&s;ts naturally in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. And with re&s;pect to the wrongs in particular which came under the juri&s;diction of the privy-council, it mu&s;t have been the intention of our legi&s;lature when they annihilated that court, that its powers &s;hould &s;o far devolve upon the court
<PB N="326" REF="336">
of &s;e&s;&s;ion; for the legi&s;lature could not in|tend to leave without a remedy, many wrongs which belonged to the juri&s;diction of the privy-council.</P>
<P>THE rule I am contending for, &s;eems to be adopted by the Engli&s;h court of chancery, in its utmo&s;t extent. Every &s;ort of wrong occa&s;ioned by the omi&s;&s;ion or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of any duty, is redre&s;&s;ed in the court of chancery, where a remedy is not otherwi&s;e provided by common or &s;tatute law. And hence it is, that the juri&s;diction of this court, confined originally within narrow bounds, has been gradually enlarged over a bound|le&s;s variety of affairs.</P>
<P>THE juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in matters of property, is not only original, but totally exclu&s;ive of all other &s;upreme courts. The property of the &s;lighte&s;t move|able, con&s;idered as a civil claim, cannot be a&s;certained by the ju&s;ticiary, by the exche|quer, by the admiralty, or by the commi&s;|&s;aries.
<PB N="327" REF="337">
The ca&s;e is not preci&s;ely the &s;ame in other matters of pecuniary intere&s;t. The commi&s;&s;aries of Edinburgh, as well as infe|rior commi&s;&s;aries, have, with the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, a cumulative juri&s;diction in all &s;uch matters referred to oath of party. And in all maritime and &s;ea-faring cau&s;es, the high court of admiralty has, by act 16. p. 1681, an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction at the fir&s;t in&s;tance. Formerly the juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in &s;uch cau&s;es, was cumulative with that of the admiral. One peculiarity there indeed was in this cumulative juri&s;diction, that where a maritime cau&s;e was brought before the &s;e&s;&s;ion at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the judge of the admiral court took his place among the Lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and voted with them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sinclair, 9th March 1543, Lord Bothwell <HI>contra</HI> Flemings.</NOTE>. But by the &s;tatute now mention|ed, the powers and privileges of the admi|ral court are greatly enlarged, and with relation to this court, the &s;e&s;&s;ion at pre&s;ent cannot be con&s;idered in any other light, than as a court of appeal; preci&s;ely as the
<PB N="328" REF="338">
hou&s;e of Lords is with relation to the &s;e&s;|&s;ion. Hence it &s;eems to follow, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion cannot regularly &s;u&s;pend the decree of an inferior admiral; which would be the &s;ame, as if a cau&s;e &s;hould be appealed from the &s;heriff to the hou&s;e of Lords. With regard to the admiral court, it mu&s;t be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that by pre&s;crip|tion it hath acquired a juri&s;diction in mer|cantile affairs; an incroachment which has no foundation, other than the natural con|nection that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between maritime af|fairs and tho&s;e that are mercantile. But the privileges of this court with re&s;pect to the former, are not extended to the latter. The court pretends not to an exclu&s;ive ju|ri&s;diction in mercantile affairs; and in the&s;e it is preci&s;ely like the &s;heriff court, con&s;i|dered as an inferior juri&s;diction, &s;ubjected to the orders and review of the &s;upreme court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, by advocation, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and reduction, in the ordinary cour&s;e. And we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ee afterwards, that the privileges of the admiral court, with
<PB N="329" REF="339">
regard to mercantile cau&s;es, are not &s;o en|tire as even tho&s;e of the &s;heriff; it being the privilege of every per&s;on to decline the admiral court in the&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed the cau&s;es proper to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, in contradi&s;tinction to the other &s;upreme courts, I proceed to cau&s;es, proper to it, in contradi&s;tinction to inferior courts. The&s;e may be compre|hended under one rule, That all extraor|dinary actions, not founded on common law, but invented to redre&s;s any defect or wrong in the common law, are appropriated to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, being in civil cau&s;es the &s;overeign and &s;upreme court. Inferior courts are ju&s;tly confined within the limits of the common law; and if extraordinary powers be nece&s;&s;ary for doing ju&s;tice, the&s;e cannot &s;afely be tru&s;ted but with a &s;overeign and &s;upreme court. Upon this account, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion only, enjoys the privilege of voiding bonds, contracts, and other private deeds. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, declarators of
<PB N="330" REF="340">
right, of nullity, and in general all declara|tors, are competent nowhere but in this court. An extraordinary removing again&s;t a tenant, who having a current tack is due a year's rent, is peculiar to this court, as al&s;o a proving of the tenor. And la&s;tly, all actions that are founded &s;olely upon equi|ty, belong to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and to none other.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to criminal juri&s;diction, our old law was abundantly circum&s;pect. Jealous of inferior courts, it confined their privileges within narrow bounds; and expe|rience, the be&s;t te&s;t of political in&s;titutions, hath ju&s;tified our law in this particular. All publick crimes, <HI>i. e.</HI> all crimes by which the publick is injured, and where, of con&s;e|quence, the King is the pro&s;ecutor, are confined to the court of ju&s;ticiary. With the political rea&s;on there is joined another, that it is not con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the crown, to pro&s;ecute in an inferior court. All private crimes, however enor|mous,
<PB N="331" REF="341">
may be pro&s;ecuted before the &s;heriff. For if the private pro&s;ecutor who is injured chu&s;e this court, the law ought to give way. The only ca&s;e where a baron is tru&s;ted with life and death, is where a thief is catched with the &s;tolen goods; and, in this ca&s;e, the law requires, that the thief be put to death within three &s;uns. The law &s;o far gives way to the natural im|pul&s;e of puni&s;hing a criminal; an indul|gence not much greater than is given to the party injured; for he him&s;elf may put the thief to death, if catched breaking his hou&s;e. But after the matter is allowed to cool, and pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, every one is &s;en&s;ible, that now there ought to be a regular trial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A baron is deprived of all juri&s;diction in capital ca&s;es, by act 20.

<P>BY the act 1681, mentioned above, an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction is given to the high admiral, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in all maritime and &s;ea-faring cau&s;es, foreign and dome&s;tick, whether civil or criminal; and over all per&s;ons within this realm, who are concerned in the &s;ame."</Q> With re&s;pect to the civil branch of this juri&s;diction, I have had occa&s;ion to mention, that by pre&s;cription it is extended to mercantile cau&s;es. But though the civil juri&s;diction of this country, is &s;o far encroached on by the court of ad|miralty, the criminal judges, I pre&s;ume, will be more watchful over the powers tru&s;ted with them. Prohibited goods were &s;eized at &s;ea, and after they were put in a boat to be carried to land, the &s;eizure-makers were
<PB N="333" REF="343">
attacked by tho&s;e who had an intere&s;t in the goods, and in the &s;cuffle a man was put to death. A criminal pro&s;ecution being brought before the court of ju&s;ticiary, the judges demurred whether it did not belong to the admiral, to try this crime as commit|ted at &s;ea. But after mature deliberation, the court &s;u&s;tained its own juri&s;diction, up|on the following grounds. It is not every civil cau&s;e ari&s;ing at &s;ea, that is appropriated to the juri&s;diction of the admiral, but only maritime and &s;ea-faring cau&s;es. In like manner, every crime committed at &s;ea, is not appropriated to this juri&s;diction. The admiral has not a juri&s;diction by the &s;tatute, unle&s;s &s;uch crime relate to maritime or &s;ea-faring matters. Every crime committed again&s;t navigation, &s;uch as a mutiny among the crew, orders di&s;obeyed, a &s;hip prevented by violence from &s;ailing, beating, wound|ing, or killing, per&s;ons in &s;uch fray, pyracy, and in general all crimes where the <HI>animus</HI> of the delinquent is to offend again&s;t the laws of navigation, are maritime or &s;ea|&s;aring
<PB N="334" REF="344">
crimes, and come under the exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction of the admiral. But if murder, adultery, forgery, or high trea&s;on, be com|mitted on board a &s;hip, the cognition will belong to the judge ordinary. The com|mi&s;&s;aries of Edinburgh will divorce, and the court of ju&s;ticiary, or commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> will puni&s;h. The only argu|ment for the admiral that &s;eems plau&s;ible is, That he is declared the King's ju&s;tice-general upon the &s;eas, and in all ports, har|bours, creeks, &amp;c. But to what effect? The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion will clear the diffi|culty. He is not made ju&s;tice-general with re&s;pect to all crimes whatever, but &s;ingly with re&s;pect to crimes concerning maritime or &s;ea-faring matters.</P>
<P>THAT a criminal juri&s;diction belongs to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is certain. The preci&s;e nature of it is not altogether &s;o certain. In&s;tead of pretending to a&s;certain a matter that appears &s;omewhat dubious, I venture no farther than to give two different views
<PB N="335" REF="345">
of this juri&s;diction, leaving every man to judge for him&s;elf. The fir&s;t is as follows. In certain criminal matters, the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, by the force of connection, have been in u&s;e to exerci&s;e a criminal juri&s;diction. Upon witne&s;&s;es who prevaricate before them, they are in u&s;e to animadvert by a corporal puni&s;hment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gosford, 6th July 1669, Heirs of Towie <HI>contra</HI> Barclay.</NOTE>. And indeed it &s;eems na|tural, that this branch of criminal juri&s;|diction, &s;hould be exerci&s;ed by every court. Again, in the ca&s;e of forgery, tried by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, the court it&s;elf commonly inflicts the puni&s;hment, where it is within the pain of death, without remitting the delinquent to the ju&s;ticiary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 14th July 1638, Dunbar <HI>contra</HI> Dunbar.</NOTE>. The puni&s;h|ment here, being a direct con&s;equence of the civil &s;entence, finding the defendant guilty of the forgery, belongs naturally to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s where the crime de&s;erves death; the inflicting of which pu|ni&s;hment, would be an encroachment too bold upon the juri&s;diction of the criminal
<PB N="336" REF="346">
court. A &s;light puni&s;hment may be con|&s;idered as acce&s;&s;ory to the civil judgment; but a capital puni&s;hment makes too great a figure in the imagination to be con&s;idered in that light.</P>
<P>I proceed to the &s;econd view of this ju|ri&s;diction, It is not accurate to &s;ay, That the two courts of &s;e&s;&s;ion and ju&s;ticiary, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the cau&s;es appropriated to each; and that the former is a civil court, the latter a criminal court. The ju&s;ticiary is confined to crimes; but the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion is not confined to civil actions. It may ju&s;tly be held, that this court hath a juri&s;diction in all crimes, unle&s;s where the proof depends totally or chiefly upon witne&s;&s;es. Not to mention puni&s;hments that are acce&s;&s;ory to judgments in civil ca&s;es, &s;uch as the puni&s;hment of forgery, many crimes publick and private are pro|&s;ecuted in this court, baratry, for ex|ample, and u&s;ury, even where it is pro|&s;ecuted by the King's advocate <HI>ad vin|dictam</HI>

P. 1701.</NOTE>, confined to this court; and for the rea&s;on now given, &s;tellionate will al&s;o be competent before it. It is clear indeed, that this court cannot judge in any criminal action that mu&s;t be tried by a jury; becau&s;e its forms admit not this me|thod of trial; and for that rea&s;on, no cri|minal action where a jury is nece&s;&s;ary can be brought before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. Purpre&s;ture mu&s;t be tried by a jury; and for that rea&s;on only, cannot be brought before it. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, a ca|pital puni&s;hment is denied to this court; for a capital puni&s;hment cannot be inflicted without a jury.</P>
<P>ECCLESIASTICAL courts, be&s;ides their cen&s;orial powers with relation to manners
<PB N="338" REF="348">
and religious tenets, have an important ju|ri&s;diction in providing pari&s;hes with proper mini&s;ters or pa&s;tors; and they exerci&s;e this juri&s;diction, by naming for the mini&s;ter of a vacant church, that per&s;on duly quali|fied who is pre&s;ented by the patron. Their &s;entence, however, is ultimate, even where their proceedings are illegal. The per&s;on authori&s;ed by their &s;entence, even in op|po&s;ition to the pre&s;entee, is <HI>de facto</HI> mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, and as &s;uch is entitled to perform every mini&s;terial function.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, that this &s;hould en|title him to the benefice or &s;tipend; for a per&s;on inve&s;ted in any office, is entitled of cour&s;e to the emoluments. And yet the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, without pretending to de|prive a mini&s;ter of his office, will bar him from the &s;tipend, if the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court have proceeded illegally in the &s;ettlement. Such interpo&s;ition of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ingular in appearance, is however founded on law, and is al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary in good policy.
<PB N="339" REF="349">
With re&s;pect to the former, there is no ne|ce&s;&s;ary connection betwixt being mini&s;ter of a pari&s;h, and being entitled to a &s;tipend; witne&s;s the pa&s;tors of the primitive church, who were maintained by voluntary contri|butions. It belongs indeed to the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical court to provide a pari&s;h with a mi|ni&s;ter: but then it belongs to the civil court, to judge whether that mini&s;ter be entitled to a &s;tipend; and the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion will find, that a mini&s;ter wrongou&s;ly &s;ettled, has no claim for a &s;tipend. With re&s;pect to the latter, it would be a great defect in the con&s;titution of a government, that eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts &s;hould have an ar|bitrary power in providing pari&s;hes with mi|ni&s;ters. To prevent &s;uch arbitrary power, the check, provided by law, is, That a mi|ni&s;ter &s;ettled illegally &s;hall not be entitled to a &s;tipend. This happily reconciles two things generally oppo&s;ite. The check is extremely mild, and yet is fully effectual to prevent the abu&s;e.</P>

THE commi&s;&s;ary court is a branch of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, in&s;tituted for the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of certain civil matters, which, a|mong our &s;uper&s;titious ance&s;tors, &s;eemed to have a more immediate connection with re|ligion; divorce, for example, ba&s;tardy, &s;can|dal, cau&s;es referred to oath of party, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;hall we &s;ay in point of juri&s;dic|tion, with re&s;pect to an injury by which a man is affronted or di&s;honoured, without being hurt in his character or good fame; as, for example, where he is reviled, or contemptuou&s;ly treated. For redre&s;&s;ing &s;uch injuries, I find no court e&s;tabli&s;hed in Bri|tain. We have not &s;uch a thing as a court of honour. Hence it is, that in England, words merely of pa&s;&s;ion are not actionable; as, you are a villain, rogue, varlet, knave. But if one calls an attorney a knave, the words are actionable, if &s;poken with relation to his profe&s;&s;ion, whereby he gets his living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Wood's In&s;tit. book 4. pa. 536.</NOTE>.
<PB N="341" REF="351">
I am not certain, that in England any ver|bal injury is actionable except &s;uch as may be attended with pecuniary lo&s;s or damage. If not, we in Scotland are more delicate. Scandal, or any imputation upon a man's good name, may be &s;ued before the com|mi&s;&s;aries, even where the &s;candal is of &s;uch a nature, that it cannot be the occa&s;ion of any pecuniary lo&s;s. It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, I am hurt in my character. If I can qualify any pecuniary damage, or probability of damage, &s;uch &s;candal is al&s;o actionable be|fore the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;everal branches of juri&s;dic|tion, civil, criminal, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, were di&s;tributed among different courts, great care &s;eems to have been taken, that courts &s;hould be confined each preci&s;ely within its own limits. Ba&s;tardy, for example, could not be tried any where but in the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical court; and &s;o &s;trictly was this ob|&s;erved, that if a que&s;tion of ba&s;tardy oc|curred incidentally, in a proce&s;s depending
<PB N="342" REF="352">
before another court, the cau&s;e was &s;tayed, till the que&s;tion of ba&s;tardy was tried in the proper court. This was done by a brieve from chancery, directed to the bi|&s;hop, to try the ba&s;tardy as a prejudicial que&s;tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 2. cap. 50.</NOTE>. The expence and delay of ju|&s;tice, occa&s;ioned by &s;uch &s;crupulous con|finement of courts within preci&s;e limits, produced in Scotland an enlargement of ju|ri&s;diction; by impowering every court to decide in all points nece&s;&s;ary to a final con|clu&s;ion of the cau&s;e. This regulation is but lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, though we had been long tending towards it. In the &s;ervice of an heir, it was the practice, and perhaps may be found &s;o at this day, that if ba&s;tardy be objected, the judge to whom the brieve is directed, is bound to &s;tay his proceedings, till the que&s;tion of ba&s;tardy be determined by the commi&s;&s;aries. But if in the reduc|tion of &s;uch a &s;ervice, ba&s;tardy be objected, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion remit not the que&s;tion of ba&s;tardy to be tried by the commi&s;&s;aries,
<PB N="343" REF="353">
but take the cogni&s;ance of it to them&s;elves, &s;ingly to the effect of fini&s;hing the reduc|tion. And this has been their practice a|bove a century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Durie, 23d July 1630, Pif&s;ligo <HI>contra</HI> David&s;on.</NOTE>. The following ca&s;e is of the &s;ame kind. A proce&s;s of aliment was brought before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, at a woman's in&s;tance again&s;t her alledged hu&s;|band. He denied the marriage, and &s;he offered a proof. It was thought by the court, that marriage here was not properly an incidental que&s;tion; that it was the fun|damental propo&s;ition, and the aliment mere|ly a con&s;equence. For this rea&s;on, they &s;tayed the proce&s;s of aliment, till the pur|&s;uer &s;hould in&s;truct her marriage before the commi&s;&s;aries. Fountainhall, 29th Decem|ber 1710, Forbes, 25th January 1711, Ca|meron <HI>contra</HI> Innes. But that this was too &s;crupulous, I have authority to &s;ay, from a &s;imilar ca&s;e determined lately. A child was produced in the &s;eventh month after mar|riage; and the woman confe&s;&s;ed, that her hu&s;band was not the father, but a man &s;he
<PB N="344" REF="354">
named. In a proce&s;s of aliment again&s;t this man, he denied that he was the father, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the pre&s;umption, <HI>quod pater e&s;t quem nuptiae demon&s;trant.</HI> Here legitimacy was the fundamental point, of which that of aliment was a con&s;equence. Yet the court, in order to give judgment on the aliment, had no difficulty of entering into the que&s;tion about the ba&s;tardy. And it was the general voice, that though, upon the medium of the child's being a ba&s;tard, they &s;hould decern for the aliment, this would not bar the child thereafter from bringing a proce&s;s before the commi&s;&s;aries, to a&s;certain its legitimacy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">January 1756, Smith <HI>contra</HI> Fowler.</NOTE>. Nor is it in|con&s;i&s;tent, that two courts &s;hould give con|trary judgments to different effects. This produces not a conflict of juri&s;dictions; for both judgments may &s;tand and be effectual. Such contrariety of judgments one would wi&s;h to avoid: but it is better to &s;ubmit to that ri&s;k, than to make it nece&s;&s;ary, that different courts &s;hould club their judgments
<PB N="345" REF="355">
to the fini&s;hing of a &s;ingle cau&s;e; which has always been found a great impediment to ju&s;tice. It is upon the &s;ame principle, that inferior judges, though they have no original juri&s;diction as to forgery, can try that crime incidentally, when &s;tated as a defence.</P>
<P>AND this leads me to con&s;ider more par|ticularly a conflict betwixt different juri&s;|dictions, where the &s;ame point is tried by both. This happens frequently, as above mentioned, with re&s;pect to different effects. But I &s;ee not that there can be in Britain a direct conflict betwixt two courts, both trying the &s;ame cau&s;e to the &s;ame effect. Oppo&s;ite judgments would indeed be in|extricable, as being flatly incon&s;i&s;tent; one of the courts, for example, order|ing a thing to be done, and the other court di&s;charging it to be done. This has happened betwixt the two hou&s;es of par|liament: it may again happen; and I know of no remedy in the con&s;titution of our
<PB N="346" REF="356">
government. But in this i&s;land, matters of juri&s;diction are better ordered than to afford place for &s;uch an ab&s;urdity. An in|direct conflict may indeed happen, where two courts handling occa&s;ionally the &s;ame point, in different cau&s;es, are of different opi|nions upon that point. Such contrariety of opinion, ought as far as po&s;&s;ible to be avoided for the &s;ake of expediency; as tending to le&s;&s;en the authority of one of the courts, and perhaps of both. But as &s;uch contrary opinions, are the foundation of judgments calculated for different ends and purpo&s;es, the&s;e judgments when put to execution, can never interfere. For example, being in pur&s;uit of a hor&s;e &s;tole from me, and, in the hands of a &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, finding a hor&s;e which I judge to be mine, I u&s;e the privilege of a proprie|tor, and take away the hor&s;e by violence. A criminal proce&s;s is brought again&s;t me for robbery; again&s;t which my defence is, that the hor&s;e is mine, and that it is lawful for a man to &s;eize his own goods
<PB N="347" REF="357">
wherever he finds them, This obliges the criminal judge to try the que&s;tion of pro|perty, as a preliminary point. It is judged, that the evidence I have given of my pro|perty, is not &s;ufficient. The re&s;ult is a &s;en|tence to re&s;tore the hor&s;e, and to pay a fine. I obey the &s;entence in both particulars. But as the que&s;tion of property was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with a view &s;olely to the criminal pro&s;ecu|tion, nothing bars me from bringing there|after a claim of property before a civil court; and if I prevail, the hor&s;e mu&s;t again be put in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This is not a conflict of execution, but only of opinion, which di&s;turbs not the peace of &s;ociety. The hor&s;e is declared mine: this &s;ecures to me the property; but does not unhinge the cri|minal &s;entence, nor relieve me from the pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>ANOTHER ca&s;e of a &s;imilar nature really exi&s;ted. Before the ju&s;tices of peace, a complaint was brought by General St. Clair, with concour&s;e of the procurator-fi&s;cal, a|gain&s;t
<PB N="348" REF="358">
John Ranken officer of exci&s;e, charg|ing, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the &s;aid John Ranken did, without any legal order, forcibly break open the doors or windows of the hou&s;e of Pitteadie, belonging to the General; and, after rummaging, left the hou&s;e open, &s;o as any per&s;on might have acce&s;s to &s;teal or carry away the furniture; and concluding that he &s;hould be fined and puni&s;hed for the &s;aid riot and tre&s;pa&s;s."</Q> The defendant acknowledged, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That up|on a particular information of prohibited goods, he, by virtue of a writ of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the court of exchequer, did force open a window of the hou&s;e, and made a &s;earch for prohibited goods, but found none; that in this matter, acting <HI>virtute officii,</HI> he was liable to no other court but the exchequer."</Q> The ju&s;tices rejected the declinator, impo&s;ed a fine upon the defendant, and ordered him to be im|pri&s;oned till payment. In this ca&s;e there is no difficulty. The officers of the re|venue are not exempted from the courts of

But I put a &s;traiter ca&s;e, That the officer had found prohibited goods, and &s;ent them to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e.

In this proce&s;s the &s;eizure is found regular, and the goods are adjudged to belong to the King. This judgment, which transfers the property to the King, relieves of cour&s;e the officer from obeying the &s;entence of the ju&s;tices ordering him to re&s;tore the goods; for if the goods belong not to the plain|tiff, he cannot demand re&s;titution. But then if the officer be fined by the ju&s;tices, their &s;entence &s;o far mu&s;t be effectual. The

The court therefore mu&s;t be competent. And if &s;o, every thing pleaded in way of defence mu&s;t al&s;o come under the cogni&s;ance of the &s;ame court, according to the modern rule, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is competent to judge of points proponed as a defence, to which the court is not competent in an original proce&s;s. 2<HI>do,</HI> With re&s;pect to the claim under con&s;ideration, it is not competent before the court of exchequer,

The juri&s;dic|tion of a territorial judge extending over all per&s;ons, and over all things within his territory, I &s;hall fir&s;t take under view per|&s;onal actions, and thereafter tho&s;e that are real. With relation to the former, it is a rule, that <HI>Actor &s;equitur forum rei.</HI> The

rea&s;on is, that the plaintiff mu&s;t apply to that judge who hath authority over his party, and can oblige him to do his duty. This mu&s;t be the judge of that territory, within which the party dwells, and has his ordinary re&s;idence. The in|habitants only, are &s;ubjected to a territorial judge, and not every per&s;on who may be found occa&s;ionally within the territory. Such a per&s;on is &s;ubjected to the judge of the territory where his re&s;idence is; and it concerns the publick police, that juri&s;dic|tions be kept as di&s;tinct as po&s;&s;ible. And as it may frequently be doubtful where the re&s;idence or domicil of a party is, a plain rule is e&s;tabli&s;hed in practice, That a man's domicil is con&s;trued to be his late&s;t re|&s;idence for forty days before the cita|tion. This however is not &s;o &s;trictly un|der&s;tood, as that a man can have but one domicil.

<P>WITH relation to juri&s;diction, civil, cri|minal, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, I have had occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve, how &s;trictly each court was confined originally within its own province. The &s;ame way of thinking obtained, with relation to territorial juri&s;diction. It was not &s;ufficient to found an action, that the defendant lived within the territory: if the cau&s;e of action did not al&s;o ari&s;e within the territory, the judge was not competent. In remedying di&s;orders and inconveniencies, men &s;eldom are moderate enough to con|fine them&s;elves within proper bounds. The juri&s;diction exerci&s;ed by chieftains over their own people was found to be &s;o inconvenient, e&s;pecially after different clans came to be mingled together by blood and commerce, that in reforming the abu&s;e, we were natu|rally carried to the oppo&s;ite extreme, by
<PB N="359" REF="369">
confining judges within the &s;tricte&s;t limits, with re&s;pect to territory as well as cau&s;es. And indeed, in e&s;tabli&s;hing territorial juri&s;|diction, the thought was natural, that it is the duty of every judge to watch over the inhabitants of his territory, and to re|gulate their conduct and behaviour while &s;ubjected to his authority; but that he hath no concern with what is done in another territory. This I &s;ay is a thought which figures extremely well in theory; and might likewi&s;e an&s;wer tolerably well in practice, while men were in a good mea&s;ure &s;tati|onary, and their commercial dealings con|fined to the neighbourhood. But it be|came altogether impracticable, after men were put in motion by exten&s;ive commerce. The impediment to the di&s;tribution of ju|&s;tice, occa&s;ioned by this narrow and con|fined principle of the common law, was in England &s;oon perceived, and an early re|medy provided. The court of the con&s;table and mari&s;hal was e&s;tabli&s;hed for trying all actions founded upon contracts, delicts,
<PB N="360" REF="370">
or other facts, that had their exi&s;tence in foreign parts; and as the common law of England did not reach &s;uch ca&s;es, the&s;e ac|tions were tried <HI>jure gentium.</HI> This court was much frequented while the Engli&s;h con|tinued to have a footing in France. After they were forced to abandon their con|que&s;ts there, this court, by want of bu&s;ine&s;s, dwindled away to nothing. To &s;upport a court with &s;o little pro&s;pect of bu&s;ine&s;s, was thought unnece&s;&s;ary; and a contrivance was found out, to bring before the courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the few cau&s;es of this na|ture that occurred. A fiction is an ad|mirable re&s;ource for lawyers, in all matters of difficulty. The cau&s;e of action is &s;et forth in the declaration, as having hap|pened in &s;ome particular place within Eng|land. It is not incumbent upon the pur|&s;uer to prove this fact, nor is it lawful for the defendant to traver&s;e it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Arth. Duck de authoritate juris civilis, L. 2. cap. 8. pars 3. &sect; 15, 16, 17, and 18.</NOTE>. But infe|rior courts enjoy not the privilege of this
<PB N="361" REF="371">
fiction; and therefore in England, to this day, an inferior court is not competent in any proce&s;s, where the cau&s;e of action doth not ari&s;e within the territory of that court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bacon's abridgement, p. 562, 563, &amp; 564.</NOTE>. It is not enough that the party again&s;t whom the claim lyes is &s;ubjected per|&s;onally to the juri&s;diction. And if he retire into foreign parts, there is no power by the common law to cite him to appear before any court in England. There is not in the practice of England any form of a citation, re&s;embling ours at the market-cro&s;s of Edin|burgh, pier and &s;hore of Leith<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">THIS defect in the common law may occa&s;ion &s;o gro&s;s inju&s;tice, that the court of chancery, I can have no doubt, will find a remedy.

<P>WE probably had once the &s;ame &s;trict way of thinking with re&s;pect to territorial judges: but in later times we have relaxed greatly and u&s;efully from &s;uch confined no|tions.
<PB N="362" REF="372">
As to an action of debt, for example, what can it &s;ignify, in point of juri&s;diction, where the cau&s;e of action aro&s;e? This cir|cum&s;tance therefore is quite di&s;regarded. If the party again&s;t whom the claim lyes, be &s;ubjected per&s;onally to the court, we reckon the juri&s;diction well founded. Crimes indeed admit of a different con&s;ideration. A judge or magi&s;trate mu&s;t pre&s;erve the peace within his own territory; but reckons him&s;elf not concerned with crimes commit|ted any where el&s;e. Upon this account, there cannot regularly be a pro&s;ecution for a crime at the in&s;tance of the publick, but before that judge within who&s;e territory the crime was committed. But, as above &s;ugge&s;ted, where the pro&s;ecution is at the in&s;tance of the party injured, he may, if he chu&s;e, bring the pro&s;ecution before that judge to whom the delinquent is &s;ubjected <HI>ratione domicilii.</HI> Such pro&s;ecution being chiefly intended to gratify the re&s;entment of the party injured, it naturally belongs to him to chu&s;e the <HI>forum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="373">
I proceed to the third exception, <HI>viz.</HI> that of nativity; and in what ca&s;es this makes a <HI>forum,</HI> de&s;erves peculiar attention; becau&s;e writers &s;eem not to have any accurate no|tions about it. Juri&s;diction was of old, for the mo&s;t part, per&s;onal, founded upon the clan-connection; every per&s;on belonging to a clan, being &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of the chieftain, and to none el&s;e. While &s;uch was the law, nativity or the <HI>locus originis,</HI> was the only circum&s;tance that founded a juri&s;diction. Commerce gave a new turn to this matter, by the connections it formed among different nations, and by the confluence it produced in places of trade from all different countries. The clan-ju|ri&s;diction becoming by the&s;e means inexpli|cable, gave place to territorial juri&s;diction; after which the <HI>locus originis</HI> became a migh|ty &s;light affair. The law of nations in|dulges individuals to change their country, and to fix their re&s;idence where they can find better bread than at home. Such mi|grations are frequent in all trading coun|tries;
<PB N="364" REF="374">
and it would be unrea&s;onable to &s;ub|ject a man to the laws of his native country, after he has de&s;erted it, and is perhaps natu|ralized in the country where he is &s;ettled for life. It is indeed not an ab&s;urd rule, that, even in this ca&s;e, the duty he owes to his native country, ought to re&s;train him from carrying arms again&s;t it; and I ob&s;erve, that this has been reckoned the law of nations. But &s;uppo&s;ing him &s;o far bound, it is a much wider &s;tep, to &s;ubject him to the courts of his native country, where he has no re&s;i|dence, where he has no effects, and to which he has no intention ever to return. I might add, were it nece&s;&s;ary, that the effect of na|tivity even with regard to trea&s;on, is at pre|&s;ent &s;carce thought rational, without other circum&s;tances to &s;upport it; and that it is a puni&s;hment too &s;evere, to put to death as guilty of high trea&s;on the &s;ubjects of a fo|reign prince taken in war, merely becau&s;e they were born in the country where they are pri&s;oners. Voet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De judiciis, &sect; 91.</NOTE> cites many authorities
<PB N="365" REF="375">
to prove, that birth &s;ingly doth not produce a <HI>forum competens, excepto &s;olo maje&s;tatis cri|mine.</HI> And therefore, upon the whole, the following conclu&s;ion &s;eems to be well found|ed, That nativity, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, &s;tands upon the preci&s;e &s;ame footing with contracts and delicts; and that like the <HI>locus contractus,</HI> and <HI>locus delicti,</HI> the <HI>locus originis</HI> will found a juri&s;diction, provided only the party be found within the terri|ritory. None of them have any other effect, than to exclude the privilege of a domicil, and to &s;ubject the party to a juri&s;diction where he hath not a re&s;idence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To carry this matter a &s;tep farther, I put the ca&s;e, That a Scot&s;man having a land-e&s;tate in Scotland, goes abroad, is naturalized in a foreign country, acquires a fortune, and &s;ettles there with his family, <HI>animo remanendi.</HI> Will not he and his de&s;cendants, while they retain their family-e&s;tate in Scotland, be con&s;idered as Scot&s;men?

<P><PB N="366" REF="376">
I am aware, that in practice actions are commonly &s;u&s;tained again&s;t natives of this country, even when they are abroad <HI>animo remanendi;</HI> and in this ca&s;e that an edictal citation at the market-cro&s;s of Edinburgh, pier and &s;hore of Leith, is held &s;ufficient. It is not however po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, that &s;uch per&s;ons, like inhabitants, are &s;ubjected to the courts of this country. The pre|text commonly is, that the decree is in|tended for no other purpo&s;e, than to attach the debtor's effects in Scotland, and his per|&s;on when he &s;hall happen to be found in his native country. Several of the&s;e ca&s;es, which cannot be ju&s;tified by principles, are collected in the dictionary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. page 327.</NOTE>. So much ap|pears from them, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion did not pretend to a&s;&s;ume a juri&s;diction over the &s;ubjects of a foreign prince, upon ac|count &s;ingly of their being natives of Scot|land; and that, in order to found &s;uch ju|ri&s;diction, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome re|ference to effects &s;ituated here, either really
<PB N="367" REF="377">
or by &s;uppo&s;ition. But there is no accuracy in this way of thinking. If nativity, &s;ingly con&s;idered, make a <HI>forum,</HI> the juri&s;diction requires no &s;upport from collateral circum|&s;tances. If on the other hand, nativity &s;ingly make not a <HI>forum,</HI> no other circum|&s;tance can be held &s;ufficient, unle&s;s actual pre&s;ence. Without this circum&s;tance the judge cannot give authority even to the fir&s;t act of juri&s;diction, <HI>viz.</HI> a citation. And therefore, all that can in this ca&s;e be done, is to proceed as again&s;t foreigners who&s;e ef|fects are found within Scotland.</P>
<P>THE foregoing exceptions to the rule of law <HI>quod actor &s;equitur forum rei,</HI> are con|&s;traints upon the defendant, by obliging him to an&s;wer in another juri&s;diction than where he has fixed his re&s;idence. Proro|gation of juri&s;diction, is an exception of a different nature, for it puts the party under no con&s;traint. Where a man is called be|fore an incompetent court, he may offer a declinator; and it is only in ca&s;e he forbear
<PB N="368" REF="378">
to make this objection, that the decree is held good again&s;t him, upon his actual or &s;uppo&s;ed acquie&s;cence in the juri&s;diction. How far and in what ca&s;es &s;uch prorogation can have effect, is not clearly laid down by our writers. Lawyers are apt to be mi&s;led, by following implicitely what is &s;aid in the Roman law upon this &s;ubject. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I &s;hall handle the &s;ubject at large, and endeavour to fix, the be&s;t way I can, how far decrees are by our law effectual, upon the footing merely of prorogation. This &s;ubject is treated by the Roman law|yers with great accuracy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 1. de judiciis.</NOTE>. The words are: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Si &s;e &s;ubjiciant alicui juri&s;dictioni et con|&s;entiant; inter con&s;entientes, euju&s;vis ju|dicis qui tribunali praee&s;t, vel aliam juri&s;|dictionem habet, e&s;t juri&s;dictio."</Q> Thus, though con&s;ent, by the Roman law, cannot make a man a judge, who is not otherwi&s;e a judge, it has however the effect, to be&s;tow upon a judge a new juri&s;diction, and to enable him to determine in a ca&s;e, to which,
<PB N="369" REF="379">
ab&s;tracting from con&s;ent, he is altogether incompetent. Upon this principle, a civil judge may determine in a criminal matter, a criminal judge in a matter that is civil, and a judge, who&s;e juri&s;diction is limited with re&s;pect to &s;ums, may give judgment without limitation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See as to this la&s;t point, I. 74. &sect; 1. de judiciis.</NOTE>. And hence the doc|trine laid down by commentators, may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood. They mention four dif|ferent ways, by which a juri&s;diction may be limited. It may be limited as to time, as to place, as to per&s;ons, and as to cau&s;es. With re&s;pect to the two fir&s;t, it is evident from the law above cited, that juri&s;diction cannot be prorogated. A judge after his commi&s;&s;ion is at an end, has no manner of juri&s;diction; and as little juri&s;diction has he, beyond the bounds of his territory. But as to per&s;ons and cau&s;es the matter is other|wi&s;e. For though con&s;ent cannot advance a private man to be a judge; yet, &s;uppo&s;ing him once a judge, con&s;ent will, in the Roman law, enable him to pronounce &s;entence a|gain&s;t
<PB N="370" REF="380">
a per&s;on not otherwi&s;e &s;ubjected to his juri&s;diction, and in a cau&s;e where he has no original juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>OUR law, with relation to per&s;ons, is the &s;ame. For though it be a rule in both laws, that the authority of a judge is confined within his territory, and that no per&s;on liv|ing in another territory is bound to obey his &s;ummons, yet by our law, as well as that of the Romans, if a man cited irregu|larly chu&s;e to appear, or if he appear with|out citation, and &s;ubmit to the judge, by pleading defences as if he were regularly cited, the juri&s;diction is thereby prorogated, and the decree hath its full effect. But with re&s;pect to cau&s;es, our law differs widely. A civil cau&s;e brought before the ju&s;ticiary or exchequer, will not produce an effectual decree, even with the expre&s;s con&s;ent of the defendant. In like manner, if a proce&s;s for contravention of laburrows, which is peculiar to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, be brought before an inferior court, the acquie&s;cence
<PB N="371" REF="381">
of the defendant, &s;ubmitting to the juri&s;|diction, and pleading defences, will not pro|rogate the juri&s;diction. The decree is null by way of exception<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haddington, 6th July 1611, Kennedy <HI>contra</HI> Kennedy.</NOTE>. And the like judg|ment was given with re&s;pect to an extraor|dinary proce&s;s of removing, founded on the le&s;&s;ee's failure to pay his rent<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Falconer, 22d December 1681, Beaton <HI>contra</HI> his tenants.</NOTE>. With re&s;pect to cau&s;es of this nature, where the judge is incompetent, it is a rule with us, That con&s;ent alone cannot found a juri&s;|diction, nor impower the judge to give &s;en|tence. Cau&s;es again&s;t members of the col|lege of ju&s;tice, when &s;ued before an inferior court, are not an exception from this rule. It is the privilege of this body, to have every civil action again&s;t them tried in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the defendant may ad|vocate upon his privilege, if he chu&s;e not to &s;ubmit to the inferior judge. Acquie&s;|cence however in the inferior judge, is not a prorogation of juri&s;diction, but merely waving a privilege; for a court which hath
<PB N="372" REF="382">
a radical juri&s;diction, &s;tands in no need of a prorogation to e&s;tabli&s;h its authority. An action of debt, for example, is compe|tent before the &s;heriff, again&s;t every inha|bitant within his territory, not excepting members of the college of ju&s;tice. The only difference is, that the&s;e enjoy the pe|culiar privilege of removing the cau&s;e, if they think proper, to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. But if they chu&s;e not to u&s;e their privilege, the &s;heriff goes on again&s;t them as again&s;t others, by virtue of his original juri&s;diction. The &s;ame is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e of the judge admiral, with relation to mercantile cau&s;es. The&s;e are not contained in his charter; but in the&s;e however he hath obtained a juri&s;|diction by pre&s;cription; not &s;o perfectly in|deed, as to oblige any one to &s;ubmit to this a&s;&s;umed juri&s;diction. If they &s;ubmit, the decree will be effectual; and even a decree in ab&s;ence will be effectual. But a defen|dant who chu&s;es not to &s;ubmit to &s;uch ju|ri&s;diction, may bring the cau&s;e before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion by advocation, &s;ingly upon
<PB N="373" REF="383">
privilege, without being obliged to a&s;&s;ign any other rea&s;on.</P>
<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed per&s;onal actions, which, with relation to territorial juri&s;diction, are fir&s;t in order, I proceed to real actions. A real action is, where the conclu&s;ion of the declaration or libel re&s;pects things only, and not per&s;ons; as, for example, a declarator of property or &s;ervitude, a declarator of marches, and &s;uch like. And the que&s;tion is, What is the proper court for trying &s;uch cau&s;es, when the &s;ubject or thing is locally within one territory, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or with|in another? This is not an intricate que|&s;tion. The an&s;wer obviou&s;ly is, That where the conclu&s;ion regards the &s;ubject, that judge mu&s;t be cho&s;en who hath authority over it, <HI>viz.</HI> the judge of that territory where it is &s;ituated; for territorial juri&s;dic|tion, undoubtedly, is connected with things as well as with per&s;ons. But then a diffi|culty occurs in this ca&s;e. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ought, in common ju&s;tice, to be called, in
<PB N="374" REF="384">
order to defend his intere&s;t; and yet he cannot be &s;ummoned by a judge within who&s;e territory he re&s;ides not. My notion in this matter may, I am afraid, appear &s;in|gular. I acknowledge, that tho&s;e per&s;ons only who have a domicil within the terri|tory, are &s;ubjected to the authority of the court; and that it is in vain for a judge to command any thing to be done or for|born, by a per&s;on who is not under his au|thority. Such per&s;on cannot even be cited to appear in court; becau&s;e no per&s;on is bound to obey the commands of a judge, who hath no authority over him. The matter, however, is not without a remedy. In&s;tead of a citation, which implies juri&s;dic|tion, why may not an intimation or notifica|tion &s;uffice, in a ca&s;e where there is no per|&s;onal conclu&s;ion again&s;t the party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a form of proce&s;s annexed to the Reg. Maje&s;t. Ch. 4. &sect; 4, &amp; 5.</NOTE>. Such notification may be given by any one, and in particular by a judge. Such notification withal, in point of material ju&s;tice, is equi|valent

to a regular citation; becau&s;e it hath all the advantages of a citation, by afford|ing the party full opportunity to defend his own intere&s;t. If this form of proce&s;s be unexceptionable in point of rationality, it is in a good mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary in point of expediency. For how otherwi&s;e &s;hall any real claim be made effectual, where the an|tagoni&s;t and the &s;ubject in debate are not both within the &s;ame territory? If I &s;hall follow the domicil of my party, a decree again&s;t him may be a foundation for da|mages, but will not put me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject. This branch of my claim can|not by any other judge be made effectual to me, than by the judge of the territory where the &s;ubject locally exi&s;ts. From this hint, it is evident, that if a notification be not &s;ufficient, the &s;upreme court mu&s;t be applied to in every ca&s;e of this nature, which would be a great defect in publick police. Nor, if a citation were nece&s;&s;ary, would even this in all ca&s;es be an effectual remedy; for what if my party be abroad <HI>animo re|manendi,</HI>
<PB N="376" REF="386">
or perhaps a foreigner? In this ca&s;e, there is no re&s;ource but the notification; and in this ca&s;e, luckily for my argument, the notification is held &s;ufficient. The pro|ce&s;s I have in my eye, is that which com|monly pa&s;&s;es under the name of arre&s;tment <HI>juri&s;dictionis fundandae gratia.</HI> The judge within who&s;e territory the goods of a fo|reign debtor are, having a juri&s;diction over the&s;e goods, though not over the proprietor, can adjudge them to a creditor for his pay|ment. In this proce&s;s of adjudication or forthcoming, the per&s;on in who&s;e hands the goods are found, is tru&s;ted with the notifi|cation; though, in my apprehen&s;ion, the proce&s;s would be more regular, and more &s;olemn, were the notification directed by authority of the court. This proce&s;s, when it re&s;pects moveables, is generally preceded by an arre&s;tment of the goods, in order to prevent their being withdrawn and carried out of the territory; and as by this means the juri&s;diction is &s;ecured, the arre&s;tment in that view is termed an arre&s;tment <HI>juri&s;|dictionis</HI>
<PB N="377" REF="387">
<HI>fundandae gratia;</HI> improperly indeed. The arre&s;tment, &s;o far from founding the juri&s;diction, &s;uppo&s;es the juri&s;diction ante|cedently founded; for by what authority could the arre&s;tment be u&s;ed, if the goods were not already &s;ubjected to the juri&s;dic|tion? And &s;o little e&s;&s;ential is an arre&s;tment to this proce&s;s, that if the creditor rely upon the per&s;on in who&s;e hands the goods are, he may carry on the proce&s;s to its final i&s;&s;ue, without u&s;ing an arre&s;tment.</P>
<P>IN following out any real action, where the di&s;pute is with one of our own country who re&s;ides not within the juri&s;diction, I &s;ee no good cau&s;e why the form now men|tioned may not be u&s;ed as well as in the ca&s;e of foreigners. And I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that we approach extremely near to this form, by obtaining the interpo&s;ition of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, or rather of the King, for citing the party to appear within the juri&s;diction where the &s;ubject lyes. The warrant for citation, in this ca&s;e, is termed a letter of
<PB N="378" REF="388">
&s;upplement, which is never given in a per|&s;onal action; for there the rule obtains, <HI>Quod actor &s;equitur forum rei.</HI> And it ap|pears to me, that this form of a letter of &s;upplement has crept in, not from nece&s;|&s;ity, becau&s;e I hold a private notification to be &s;ufficient, but from the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of cu&s;tom; a regular citation, as the fir&s;t &s;tep of proce&s;s, being &s;o general, as to be thought nece&s;&s;ary in all ca&s;es. Cu&s;tom is &s;o natu|rally productive of a bias, and takes &s;o firm hold of the mind, that it requires the ut|mo&s;t fortitude of rea&s;on to overcome it. Were I not afraid of refining too much, I would venture to &s;ay further, that every inhabitant in Scotland, being in civil cau&s;es &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, is bound to appear there when regu|larly called. But I deny their &s;ubjection to be &s;uch, as to put it in the power of this court, to oblige them to appear in any court to which they are not &s;ubjected. If my creditor &s;hall bring a proce&s;s again&s;t me for payment before a &s;heriff, within who&s;e ter|ritory
<PB N="379" REF="389">
I have no re&s;idence, the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion cannot give warrant for a letter of &s;up|plement to oblige me to defend my&s;elf there; and were my pre&s;ence equally nece&s;|&s;ary in a real action, a letter of &s;upplement could not be i&s;&s;ued in a real action more than in one that is per&s;onal. But my pre|&s;ence is not nece&s;&s;ary, where there is no per|&s;onal conclu&s;ion again&s;t me. Common ju|&s;tice indeed requires a notification; and the de&s;ign of a letter of &s;upplement is not to be a warrant for citation, but only for notification.</P>
<P>To view this matter in its different cir|cum&s;tances, we &s;hall invert the ca&s;e, by &s;uppo&s;ing the debtor to be within the juri&s;|diction, and not his effects. Upon a minute of &s;ale of land, the vender is &s;ued within the &s;heriffdom where he re&s;ides, to grant a di&s;po&s;ition. Damages may be awarded for not fulfilling the covenant, but the land cannot be adjudged to the pur&s;uer, becau&s;e it is not under the &s;heriff's juri&s;|diction.
<PB N="380" REF="390">
The &s;heriff hath, by pre&s;crip|tion, obtained a privilege of pronouncing a decree of adjudication <HI>contra hereditatem jacentem:</HI> but if the real e&s;tate be not locally within his territory, he cannot pro|nounce &s;uch a decree. Hence in this mat|ter a remarkable difference appears, be|twixt a judicial transference of property or any real decerniture, and a per&s;onal decer|niture re&s;pecting a particular &s;ubject. The former is <HI>ultra vires</HI> where the &s;ubject is not locally within the territory: not &s;o the latter; for it is enough that the defendant have his re&s;idence within the territory. A judge may interpo&s;e his authority, and com|mand the defendant to fulfil his bargain, by conveying land or moveables to the pur|&s;uer. To found the judge's authority in this ca&s;e, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;ubject be locally within the territory. But what if after all the defendant be refractory? The judge may puni&s;h him with impri&s;on|ment, or condemn him in damages. There the judge mu&s;t &s;top &s;hort; for he has no

<P>IN the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, I have given a &s;ketch of the different powers of our &s;upreme courts, with re&s;pect to cau&s;es. Upon the pre&s;ent head it is proper to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e courts are al&s;o, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;tingui&s;hed with re&s;pect to terri|tory.
<PB N="383" REF="393">
The territorial juri&s;dictions of the ju&s;ticiary and exchequer are not confined to land, but reach over all friths, and al&s;o over the &s;ea adjoining to the land.

The juri&s;diction of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is not le&s;s exten&s;ive, con&s;idered as territorial; and it enjoys be&s;ides a juri&s;diction over all the na|tives of Scotland wherever exi&s;ting, provid|ed they have not de&s;erted their native coun|try, but are abroad occa&s;ionally only<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See abridgment of &s;tatute-law, Note 7th.</NOTE>.

<P>ADVANCING to our courts con&s;idered as &s;uperior and inferior, I begin with ob|&s;erving, that the common method of &s;eek|ing
<PB N="384" REF="394">
redre&s;s of inju&s;tice done by an inferior court, is by appealing to one that is &s;upe|rior. That this particularly was the me|thod in Scotland, is clear from our mo&s;t ancient law-books. It is laid down, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a party may appeal from one court to another, as oft as judgment is given a|gain&s;t him, finding borghs lawful for every doom gain&s;aid; from court to court; till it be decided for or again&s;t him in parliament; from which no ap|peal can be made; becau&s;e it is the highe&s;t court, and ordained for redre&s;|&s;ing wrongs done by all inferior courts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mod.

<P><PB N="385" REF="395">
THIS method for obtaining redre&s;s of wrong judgment, hath in Scotland gone into di&s;u&s;e, excepting an appeal to the Bri|ti&s;h hou&s;e of Lords from the &s;overeign courts; and to the higher eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts from tho&s;e that are inferior.

We are here left in the dark by our writers. I &s;hall endeavour however to trace this matter the be&s;t way I can; &s;upplying the want of po&s;itive facts by ra|tional conjecture.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="396">
IN order to talk with the greater per|&s;picuity, I find it nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e a hi&s;torical account of the &s;upreme courts, that in this country have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been e&s;tabli&s;hed for civil cau&s;es. Through mo&s;t of the European nations, at a certain period of their hi&s;tory, the King and council com|po&s;ed the only &s;upreme civil court, in which all cau&s;es were tried that came not under the juri&s;diction of inferior courts. But it mu&s;t be remarked, that, in Scotland at lea&s;t, this was not a court of appeal; for, as a|bove ob&s;erved, cau&s;es originally were re|moved by appeal from the King's ju&s;ticiary to the parliament, and thereafter to per&s;ons appointed by the King with parliamentary powers. This court, compo&s;ed of the King and council, having no continuance, nor re|gular times of meeting and di&s;tributing ju|&s;tice, was extremely inconvenient; and it greatly heightened the inconvenience, that the King who pre&s;ided, being involved in the greater affairs of government, had little time or inclination for deciding in
<PB N="387" REF="397">
private affairs. This made it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h regular courts for different cau&s;es; having appointed terms of &s;ufficient length for all matters that &s;hould come before them. Thus in England, the King's bench, the exchequer, and the court of common pleas, aro&s;e out of the &s;aid court, and were all fully e&s;tabli&s;hed in the reign of Ed|ward I. We did not &s;oon apply &s;o effectual a remedy. The fir&s;t thought that occurred to our legi&s;lature, was to relieve the King and council, by &s;ub&s;tituting in their place the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 65. p. 1425.</NOTE>, to &s;it three times in the year, in order <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"finally to determine all and &s;undry complaints, cau&s;es, and quarrels that may be determined before the King and his council."</Q> This court acted but forty days at a time; and the members, who &s;erved by rotation, were &s;o numerous, that the round was &s;eldom com|pleated in le&s;s time than &s;even years<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See act 63. p. 1457.</NOTE>. This court was far from being a compleat reme|dy. Its members and its place of &s;itting
<PB N="388" REF="398">
were changeable; and its terms were too &s;hort for expediting bu&s;ine&s;s. The next at|tempt to remedy the inconveniencies of the former courts, was the daily council, erected by the act 58. p. 1503. The &s;tatute, after narrating the great delay of ju&s;tice, occa|&s;ioned by the &s;hort terms of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and their want of time to fini&s;h cau&s;es, ap|points a council to be cho&s;en by the King, to &s;it continually in Edinburgh the year round, or where el&s;e it &s;hall plea&s;e the King to appoint, to determine all cau&s;es that were formerly competent before the &s;e&s;&s;ion. This court, called <HI>The Daily Council,</HI> from their &s;itting daily through the year, was al&s;o defective in its con&s;titution, having no <HI>quorum</HI> named, nor any compul&s;ion upon the judges to attend. The &s;ame cau&s;es pa&s;&s;ing through the hands of different judges at different times, was a great im|pediment to the regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. In a politic body of judges, there is not a greater di&s;ea&s;e than a fluctuation of the members. This court accordingly
<PB N="389" REF="399">
was &s;oon laid a&s;ide, to make way for the court of council and &s;e&s;&s;ion, e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>anno</HI> 1532, in the &s;ame form that at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, having &s;tated terms of a rea&s;onable endurance, and a certain number of judges, who all of them are tied to a punctual at|tendance.</P>
<P>TO return to appeals, I remark, that an appeal was competent again&s;t an interlocu|tory as well as again&s;t a definitive &s;en|tence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 41. p. 1471.</NOTE>; which behoved to be extremely vexatious, by putting it in the power of the defendant to prolong a cau&s;e without end. Let us only figure a civil action furni&s;hing exceptions partly dilatory and partly pe|remptory, to the amount of half a dozen, which is no bold &s;uppo&s;ition; and let us ob|&s;erve what may follow. In an appeal the a&s;cent behoved to be gradual to the court next in order; and there was not acce&s;s to the court in the la&s;t re&s;ort, unle&s;s redre&s;s was denied by each of the intermediate
<PB N="390" REF="400">
courts. Thus, from the &s;entence of a ba|ron court, or of the baillie court in a royal burrow, there behoved to be no fewer than three appeals in order to obtain the judg|ment of the parliament, or of the court of appeal put in place of the parliament. Hence each of the exceptions above &s;uppo&s;|ed, might occa&s;ion no fewer than three ap|peals; and con&s;equently there might be eighteen appeals in this cau&s;e before a final determination; a mo&s;t admirable device to give full &s;cope to a &s;pirit of litigio&s;ity, which, by all wi&s;e men, came to be deemed an intolerable grievance. The fir&s;t attempt I find made for redre&s;s, is in the act 105. p. 1487, be&s;towing a privilege upon tho&s;e who are hurt by the partiality of inferior judges, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to &s;ummon before the King and council, the judge and party, who &s;hall be bound to bring the rolls of court along with them in order to verify the matters of fact: and if iniquity be committed, the proce&s;s &s;hall be reduced and an|nulled."</Q> It is declared at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="391" REF="401">
that this method of obtaining redre&s;s, &s;hall not exclude the ordinary proce&s;s of appeal, if it &s;hall be more agreeable to the party aggrieved. This regulation is declared to endure till the next parliament only. But though we do not find it renewed in any following parliament, it would be ra&s;h to infer that it was laid a&s;ide. If it was re|li&s;hed by the nation, which we have great rea&s;on to believe, it is more natural to infer, that it was kept in ob&s;ervance without a &s;tatute. One thing appears from the re|cords of the daily council &s;till pre&s;erved, that very early after the in&s;titution of this court, complaints were received again&s;t the proceedings and decrees of inferior judges, and, upon iniquity found, that the proceed|ings were rectified or annulled. The very nature and con&s;titution of this court, be|hoved to give birth to &s;ome &s;uch remedy; e&s;pecially as the remedy was not altogether new. This court could not receive an ap|peal, becau&s;e no &s;uch privilege was be&s;tow|ed upon it; and the whole forms of a pro|ce&s;s
<PB N="392" REF="402">
of appeal, were accurately adju&s;ted by parliament immediately after the in&s;titution of this court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 95. p. 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>. Now, no man who had once experienced an ea&s;ier remedy, would ever patiently &s;ubmit to the hard&s;hip and expence, of multiplying appeals through dif|ferent courts, before he could get his cau&s;e determined in the la&s;t re&s;ort. We may therefore readily believe, that a direct appli|cation to the daily council for redre&s;s, would be the choice of every man who conceived inju&s;tice to be done him by an inferior judge. He could not bring his cau&s;e before this court by appeal; which ju&s;tified his bringing it by &s;ummons or complaint. And in this form he had not any difficulty to &s;truggle with, more than in an appeal; for the former requires no antecedent autho|rity from the court, more than the latter. This a&s;&s;umed power of reviewing the de|crees of inferior judges, was &s;oon improved into a more regular form. Decrees of regi|&s;tration were from the beginning &s;u&s;pended
<PB N="393" REF="403">
and reduced in this court; and by its very in&s;titution it was the proper court for &s;uch matters. The &s;ame method came to be followed, in redre&s;&s;ing iniquity committed by inferior judges. In place of a complaint, a regular proce&s;s of reduction was brought; and becau&s;e this proce&s;s did not &s;tay exe|cution, the defect was &s;upplied by a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>HERE then is a matter fairly accounted for, which &s;eems to have puzzled our anti|quaries, <HI>viz.</HI> How it comes that we hear not of appeals after the in&s;titution of the college of ju&s;tice. Stair, in the pa&s;&s;age cited above, &s;ays &s;lighty, That after the in|&s;titution of this college, they fell in de&s;ue|tude, and gave place to advocations, &s;u|&s;pen&s;ions and reductions. We now find this to be a mi&s;take. And indeed had they not been antecedently in di&s;u&s;e, it would be difficult to account how it &s;hould have hap|pened, that in none of the records, relative to the in&s;titution of this court, is there a
<PB N="394" REF="404">
&s;ingle word of appeals. On the contrary, in the very fir&s;t form of proce&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed for this court, we find reductions of inferior decrees among tho&s;e proce&s;&s;es, which are to be called in a certain order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 45. p. 1537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved by the way, that this proce&s;s of reduction, fir&s;t practi&s;ed in the daily council, and afterwards in the pre&s;ent court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, put an end to the difference betwixt the &s;heriff and baron courts in point of &s;uperiority. When ap|peals went into di&s;u&s;e, the &s;heriff lo&s;t his power of reviewing the &s;entences of the baron court; and the&s;e courts came by de|grees to be con&s;idered as of equal rank, when the proceedings of both were equally &s;ubjected to the review of the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE redre&s;s of wrong judgment by ap|pealing to a &s;uperior court, is undoubtedly the more natural remedy; becau&s;e, in ca&s;e
<PB N="395" REF="405">
of variance, it re&s;embles in private life an appeal to a common friend, or to a neutral per&s;on. But reductions and &s;u&s;pen&s;ions have more the air of a compleat legal police. The&s;e actions proceed upon authority of letters from the King, who, by the form of the action, is conceived to be watchful over the welfare of his people, and attentive that ju&s;tice be done them. In this view, when|ever an act of inju&s;tice is done by an infe|rior court, he brings the cau&s;e before his own court, where he is more confident that ju&s;tice will be impartially di&s;tributed.</P>
<P>THE connection of the &s;ubjects leads me to the hi&s;tory of an advocation, or of a <HI>Cer|tiorari,</HI> as termed in England, which at any rate mu&s;t not be neglected; being the form for redre&s;&s;ing iniquity committed by an in|ferior judge, before the final &s;entence is pro|nounced. An advocation originally was not granted but for a delay or refu&s;al of ju&s;tice. So &s;ays Voet in expre&s;s terms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De judiciis. &sect;. 143.</NOTE>. And that
<PB N="396" REF="406">
this al&s;o was the u&s;e of an advocation here, appears from Reg. Maj. L. 3. cap. 20, 21. The King and council was at fir&s;t the only court that had the privilege of advocating cau&s;es <HI>ob denegatam ju&s;titiam.</HI> This privi|lege was not communicated to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in&s;tituted in the 1425; for it ap|pears from act 62. p. 1457, that the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion was confined to original actions founded on brieves; and complaints again&s;t judges for delay of ju&s;tice, continued as formerly to be tried before the King and council, act 26. p. 1469, act 62. p. 1475. From the former of the&s;e it appears, that, upon a complaint of inju&s;tice or partiality, letters of advocation were i&s;&s;ued to bring the judge before the King and council, to an&s;wer to the complaint, and to puni&s;h him if the complaint was verified. But as to the cau&s;e it&s;elf, &s;o &s;trictly was the rule ob|&s;erved of confining an advocation to the denial or delay of ju&s;tice, that the party wronged got in this ca&s;e no redre&s;s; being left to &s;eek redre&s;s in the ordinary form of
<PB N="397" REF="407">
law by an appeal. Matters of government, by the increa&s;e of commerce and connec|tions with foreign &s;tates, becoming gradual|ly more intricate and involved, the admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice by the King and coun|cil, came to be pretty much neglected. The privilege of advocation, which had been denied to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, was permit|ted to the daily council; but &s;till to be exerci&s;ed within its original limits. Bal|four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 342. cap. 12.</NOTE> mentions a ca&s;e &s;o late as the 1531, where it was decided, that after liti&s;con|te&s;tation a cau&s;e could not be advocated; for liti&s;conte&s;tation removed any pretext of a complaint for delay of ju&s;tice. But the pre&s;ent court of &s;e&s;&s;ion begun early to apply the remedy of an advocation, to correct unju&s;t or irregular proceedings in inferior courts, termed Iniquity in the law-language of Scotland. An appeal by this time was in di&s;repute; and &s;eeing it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, that iniquity could be redre&s;&s;ed by a re|duction after a final &s;entence, it was thought
<PB N="398" REF="408">
natural to prevent an unju&s;t &s;entence, by advocating the cau&s;e, whenever iniquity was committed, in order in&s;tantly to redre&s;s the wrong. And the court was encouraged to proceed in this manner, from a ju&s;t con|viction, that it was a &s;horter and le&s;s ex|pen&s;ive method of obtaining redre&s;s, than by an appeal. Thus it came about, that an advocation, invented as a remedy for delay of ju&s;tice, was extended to remove cau&s;es to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, where there was any &s;u&s;picion of partiality in the infe|rior judge, or where there occurred any per|&s;onal objection, till it obtained, that ini|quity &s;ingly was a &s;ufficient ground. This change, however beneficial to the publick, was not allowed to take place without op|po&s;ition. The improvement, it would ap|pear, was not at fir&s;t reli&s;hed by our legi&s;|lature. It was ordained by the act 39. p. 1555, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That cau&s;es be not advocated by the Lords from the judge ordinary, except for deadly feud, or where the judge is a party, or the cau&s;es of the
<PB N="399" REF="409">
Lords of &s;e&s;&s;ion, their advocates, &s;cribes, and members."</Q> But this &s;tatute occa|&s;ioned by the &s;till remaining influence of former practice, having no great authority, &s;oon &s;lipt into di&s;u&s;e. Advocations upon iniquity gaining ground daily, bani&s;hed ap|peals again&s;t interlocutory &s;entences; and being more ea&s;y and expeditious, became the only remedy.</P>
<P>AFTER appeals were laid a&s;ide in civil actions, and gave place to advocations, re|ductions and &s;u&s;pen&s;ions, the power of advo|cation was for many years reckoned an extra|ordinary privilege, competent to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion only. Stair ob&s;erves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L. 4. Tit. 1. &sect;. 35.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no court in Scotland has this privilege but the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion."</Q> It was un|doubtedly &s;o in his time; but matters have &s;ince taken a different turn. The court of ju&s;ticiary enjoys this privilege, and even the admiral court; and from the following hi&s;torical deduction, it will appear by what
<PB N="400" REF="410">
means the&s;e courts have extended their pri|vileges. The writ of <HI>Certiorari</HI> in England, is the &s;ame with our advocation. The court of chancery being the &s;upreme civil court, and the King's bench being the &s;u|preme criminal court, can both of them i&s;&s;ue a <HI>certiorari.</HI> No other court in Eng|land enjoys this privilege. Some method for redre&s;&s;ing iniquity committed by an in|ferior judge, is not le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in criminal than in civil actions. The only difference is, that in a criminal action the remedy mu&s;t be applied, before the matter be brought before the jury; for we &s;hall &s;ee by and by that a verdict is inviolable. An appeal to a &s;uperior court, was originally the only me|thod, in criminal as well as in civil actions. The inconveniencies of this method, ren|dered it generally unpopular. We have heard that it gave way to advocation in civil cau&s;es, which was reckoned a great improvement. The practice of England &s;howed the advantages of the &s;ame method in criminal cau&s;es. But how to come at
<PB N="401" REF="411">
this remedy, was a matter of no &s;mall diffi|culty. The privilege of advocation, accord|ing to the e&s;tabli&s;hed notion, was confined to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The ju&s;ticiary court did not pretend to this privilege, and the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion could not properly interpo&s;e in matters which belonged to another &s;u|preme court. The known advantages of an advocation, as an expeditious method for obtaining redre&s;s of wrong judgment, &s;ur|mounted this difficulty. The court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion received complaints of wrong done by inferior criminal judges, and upon finding a complaint well founded, took upon them to remove the cau&s;e by advocation to the ju&s;ticiary. They al&s;o ventured to remove criminal cau&s;es from one court, to another that was more competent and un&s;u&s;pec|cted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Durie, 9th January 1629, Baron of Burghton <HI>contra</HI> Kincaid.

cho&s;en from time to time to hold circuit courts, encouraged the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to claim this extraordinary privilege. And through the &s;ame influence they interpo&s;ed in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters al&s;o.

<P>THE court of ju&s;ticiary, after it was new modeled by the act 1672, received additi|onal &s;plendor, and made a much greater figure than formerly. It did not however begin early to feel its own weight and importance. This court did not at fir&s;t a&s;&s;ume the privilege of advocation, though now that appeals were totally in di&s;u&s;e, that
<PB N="403" REF="413">
privilege belonged to it as the &s;upreme court in criminal actions, as well as to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in tho&s;e that are civil. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion continued to exerci&s;e the power of advocation as formerly; for which we have Mackenzie's evidence in his criminals, title <HI>Advocations,</HI> and that of Dirleton in his doubts, upon the &s;ame title. But the court of ju&s;ticiary afterwards, took this privilege to it&s;elf, and the court hath a &s;ignet of its own, which gives authority to its ad|vocations. This privilege, as is u&s;ual, was a&s;&s;umed at fir&s;t with &s;ome degree of he&s;ita|tion. It was doubted, whether a &s;ingle judge could pa&s;s an advocation, or even grant a &s;i&s;t upon a bill of advocation. Some thought the matter of &s;o great importance, as to require a <HI>quorum</HI> of the judges. But the practice of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, made this doubt vani&s;h. There are many in|&s;tances as early as the 1699 and 1700, of advocations being pa&s;t by &s;ingle judges; and now it is no longer a matter of doubt. It remains only to be added upon this head,
<PB N="404" REF="414">
that the judge admiral, following the ex|ample of the two &s;upreme courts of &s;e&s;&s;ion and ju&s;ticiary, is in the practice of advo|cating cau&s;es to him&s;elf from inferior ad|miral courts.</P>
<P>THE privilege of advocation introduced that of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, which is now cu&s;tomary in the court of ju&s;ticiary, with regard to any error in the proceedings of the inferior judge. This court, &s;o far as I know, has never &s;u&s;tained a reduction of a criminal &s;en|tence pronounced by an inferior judge; and it appears to me doubtful, whether the court will ever be inclined to extend its juri&s;dic|tion &s;o far. My rea&s;on of doubt is, that a regular proce&s;s of reduction is not proper for a court which hath no continuance, and which is held occa&s;ionally only. And were it proper, the privilege would be of very little u&s;e. An error in an interlocutory &s;entence of an inferior judge, may be cor|rected by an advocation. The execution of a &s;entence of condemnation, may be pre|vented
<PB N="405" REF="415">
by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. If the per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed be acquitted by the verdict of the jury, the matter cannot be brought under review by reduction. If he be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the bar upon any informality in the proce&s;s, he is liable to a new pro&s;ecution. I can di&s;cover then no nece&s;&s;ity for a reduc|tion, except &s;ingly with regard to pecuniary matters, as where damages and expences are unju&s;tly refu&s;ed. If in &s;uch ca&s;es the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion could not interpo&s;e, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for the court of ju&s;ticiary to un|dertake the reduction. But as the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is reckoned competent to pecuniary matters, from whatever cau&s;e they ari&s;e, civil or criminal, the ju&s;ticiary court acts wi&s;ely, in leaving &s;uch reduction to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. This draws after it another con|&s;equence by a natural connection. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, which by way of reduction, judges of fines, expences, and damages, re|fu&s;ed in an inferior criminal court, a&s;&s;umes naturally the power to judge of the &s;ame articles by way of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, when an ex|orbitant
<PB N="406" REF="416">
&s;um is given. The&s;e con&s;iderations clearly lay open the foundation of a practice current in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. Of riots, batteries, and bloodwits, depending before the &s;heriff or other inferior judge, no advo|cation is i&s;&s;ued, becau&s;e the court hath not an original juri&s;diction in &s;uch matters. But as the puni&s;hment of &s;uch delinquencies is commonly a pecuniary fine, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;u&s;tains its juri&s;diction in the &s;econd in&s;tance by reduction or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 4th March 1707, Alves <HI>contra</HI> Maxwell.</NOTE>. From what is now &s;aid, it mu&s;t follow, that the courts of &s;e&s;&s;ion and ju&s;ticiary, have in &s;ome particulars a cumulative juri&s;diction. In a criminal pro&s;ecution before the &s;heriff, the per&s;on accu&s;ed is, for example, acquitted, and obtains immoderate expence again&s;t the pro&s;ecutor, without any good foundation. In this, and many ca&s;es of the &s;ame kind which may be figured, the party aggrieved has his option to apply to either court for a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="417">
UPON the power of reviewing the pro|ceedings of inferior courts, whetherbythe old form of appeal, or by the latter forms of advocation and reduction, what I have &s;aid relates &s;ingly to iniquity committed by the judge. Iniquity alledged committed by a jury in giving their verdict, was re&s;erved to be handled &s;eparately. In judging of proof, every thing &s;worn by a witne&s;s in judgment, was held by our forefathers to be true, a po&s;ition which indicates great integrity and &s;implicity of manners, but little knowledge of mankind. So far was this carried, that, till within a century and a half, a defendant was not &s;uffered to alledge any fact contrary to tho&s;e contained in the declaration or libel. The rea&s;oning of our judges was to the fol|lowing purpo&s;e. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The pur&s;uer hath under|taken to prove the facts mentioned in his libel. If he prove them, they mu&s;t be true; and therefore any contradictory fact alledged by the defendant mu&s;t be fal&s;e."</Q> Hence the rule in our old law, That what is determined by an a&s;&s;ize mu&s;t
<PB N="408" REF="418">
be held for truth, and cannot thereafter pa&s;s to another a&s;&s;ize. This is declared to be the rule in verdicts, even upon civil ac|tions, Reg. Maj. L. 1. cap. 13. &sect;. 3. Quon. attach. cap. 82. But in the &s;ervice of brieves not pleadable, &s;uch as a brieve of inque&s;t, of tutory, of idiocy, which may be carried on without waiting for a contra|dictor, it was found by experience, that the verdict is not always to be tru&s;ted. And therefore by the act 47. p. 1471, a remedy was provided, which was a complaint to the King and council of the fal&s;ehood or ignorance of the inque&s;t; and if the ver|dict was found wrong, it was voided, and the parties concerned were re&s;tored to their original &s;ituation. The legi&s;lature did not venture upon any remedy, where the ver|dict proceeded upon a pleadable brieve. This was left upon the common law, which pre&s;erves the verdict entire, even where it is proved to be iniquitous, being &s;atisfied to keep jurymen to their duty by the terror of puni&s;hment. In a proce&s;s of error, they
<PB N="409" REF="419">
were &s;ummoned before a great inque&s;t, and, if found guilty of perjury, they were pu|ni&s;hed with e&s;cheat of moveables, infamy, and a year's impri&s;onment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. L. 1. cap. 14.</NOTE>. This is a &s;ingular regulation, which deviates from ju&s;t principles, and has not a parallel in the whole body of our law. It is both common and rational, to redre&s;s a wrong with relation to the party aggrieved, without proceeding to puni&s;h the wrong-doer, where he can excu&s;e or extenuate his fault. But it is not le&s;s uncommon than irrational, to puni&s;h a de|linquent, without affording any relief to the party injured. However this be, the &s;um|mons of error is limited to three years, not only where the purpo&s;e is to have the a&s;|&s;izers puni&s;hed, but al&s;o as to the conclu&s;ion of annulling the verdict or its retour upon a brieve not pleadable<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 57. p. 1494.</NOTE>. But the reduction of the verdict or retour, upon a brieve of inque&s;t, was afterwards extended to twenty years<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Act 13. p. 1617.</NOTE>. No verdict pronounced in a cri|minal
<PB N="410" REF="420">
cau&s;e ever was reviewable. For though the jury &s;hould be found guilty of perjury by a great a&s;&s;ize, yet their verdict is declared to be <HI>res judicata,</HI> whether for or again&s;t the pannel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act 63. p. 1475.</NOTE>. So far as I can di&s;cover, the &s;ame rule obtained with regard to verdicts in civil ca&s;es, retours alone excepted; and continued to be the rule till jury-trials in civil ca&s;es were laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>AND as the di&s;u&s;e of jury-trials in civil cau&s;es, is another revolution in our law, not le&s;s memorable than that already handled concerning appeals, the connection of mat|ter offers me a fair opportunity to trace the hi&s;tory of this revolution, and to di&s;|cover, if I can, by what influence or by what means it has happened, that juries are no longer employed in civil actions, even where proof is requi&s;ite. To throw all the light I can upon a dark part of the hi&s;tory of law, which is overlooked by all our writ|ers, I mu&s;t take the help of a maxim which
<PB N="411" REF="421">
appears to have been adopted by our fore|fathers, and to have had a &s;teady influence in the practice of law. The maxim is, That though que&s;tions in law may be tru&s;t|ed to a &s;ingle judge, matters of proof are &s;afe&s;t in the hands of a plurality. It was probably thought, that in determining que|&s;tions of law there is little tru&s;t repo&s;ed in a judge, becau&s;e he is tied down to a pre|ci&s;e rule; but that as no preci&s;e rule can be laid down to direct the judgment in matters of proof, all que&s;tions of this kind ought to be referred to a number of judges, who are a check one upon another. Whatever may be the foundation of this maxim, we find it con&s;tantly applied in practice. In all courts, civil and criminal, governed by a &s;ingle judge, we find juries always employ|ed. Before the judge matters of law were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and every thing preparatory to the verdict; but to the jury was re&s;erved to judge of the matter of fact. On the other hand, juries never were employed in any Briti&s;h court, where the judges were &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="412" REF="422">
numerous to act the part of a jury. Juries, for example, were never employed in parliament, nor in proce&s;&s;es before the King and council. And in England, when the court la&s;t named was &s;plit into the King's bench, the exchequer, and the common pleas, I am verily per&s;uaded, that the con|tinuance of jury-trials in the&s;e new courts, was owing to the following circum&s;tance, that four judges only were appointed in each of them, and but a &s;ingle judge in the circuit-courts. Hence I pre&s;ume, that juries were not employed in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, in&s;tituted <HI>anno</HI> 1425. The very nature of its in&s;titution leads me to think &s;o; not only that the members of this court were cho&s;en out of the three e&s;tates; but al&s;o that the purpo&s;e of its in&s;titution was to relieve the King and council, of the load of bu&s;ine&s;s growing daily upon them. There is little rea&s;on to doubt, that this new court, con&s;i&s;ting of many members, would follow and imitate the forms of the two courts, to which it was &s;o nearly allied. And
<PB N="413" REF="423">
that this was really the ca&s;e, may be gathered not ob&s;curely from Balfour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 443. cap. 5.</NOTE>. One thing we are certain of, without nece&s;&s;ity of recur|ring to a conjecture, that the daily council, which came in place of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and equally with it con&s;i&s;ted of many judges, had not from the beginning any jury-trials, but took evidence by witne&s;&s;es, and in every cau&s;e gave judgment upon the proof, pre|ci&s;ely as we do at this day. The&s;e facts con&s;idered, it &s;eems a well founded conjec|ture, that &s;o large a number of judges as fifteen, which con&s;titute our pre&s;ent court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, were appointed with a view to the practice of the preceeding courts, and in order to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of trying cau&s;es by juries. In the former court, <HI>viz.</HI> The daily council, we find it compo&s;ed of bi&s;hops, abbots, earls, lords, gentlemen, and burge&s;&s;es, in order probably that every man might be tried by &s;ome at lea&s;t of his own rank; and in examining the records of this court, we find at fir&s;t few &s;ederunts, but
<PB N="414" REF="424">
where at lea&s;t twelve judges are pre&s;ent. This matter is &s;till better ordered in the pre&s;ent court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. Nine judges mu&s;t be pre&s;ent to make a <HI>quorum;</HI> and it &s;eldom happens in examining any proof, that the judges pre&s;ent are under twelve in number. This I am per&s;uaded is the foundation of a maxim, which among us pa&s;&s;es current, without any direct autho|rity from the regulations concerning the juri&s;diction of this court. It is &s;aid to be the grand jury of the nation <HI>in civilibus;</HI> and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that its privilege to take proof without the aid of a jury, proceeds from this branch of its con&s;titution. In fact, it is the inviolable practice to give judgment upon the te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es, in a full court where there mu&s;t always be at lea&s;t a <HI>quorum</HI> pre&s;ent; which is no &s;light indication that the court in this ca&s;e acts as a jury. For why otherwi&s;e &s;hould it be le&s;s competent to a &s;ingle member of the court, to judge of a proof than to judge of a point of law? This account of the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="415" REF="425">
as having united in it the powers both of the judge and jury, cannot fail to be reli&s;hed, when it is di&s;covered, that this was far from being a novelty when the court was in&s;tituted. The thought was borrow|ed from the court of parliament, the mem|bers of which, in all trials, acted both as judges and jurymen. One clear in&s;tance we have upon record, <HI>anno</HI> 1481, in the trial of Lord Lile for high trea&s;on. The members pre&s;ent, the King only excep|ted, formed them&s;elves into a jury, and brought in a regular verdict, declaring the pannel not guilty. A copy of the trial is annexed, Appendix, N^o. 5.</P>
<P>UPON this occa&s;ion, I cannot avoid de|claring my opinion, that in civil cau&s;es, it is a real improvement to tru&s;t with e&s;tabli&s;h|ed judges, the power of deciding upon facts as well as upon law. A number of men trained up to law, and who are daily in the practice of weighing evidence, may un|doubtedly be more relied on for doing ju|&s;tice,
<PB N="416" REF="426">
than the &s;ame number occa&s;ionally collected from the ma&s;s of the people, to undertake an unaccu&s;tomed ta&s;k, which is, to pronounce a verdict upon an intricate proof.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING the foregoing account why juries are not employed in the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion, to be &s;atisfactory, it will no doubt occur, that it proves nothing with re&s;pect to inferior courts, where the judges are ge|nerally &s;ingle. I admit the ob&s;ervation to be ju&s;t; and therefore mu&s;t a&s;&s;ign a dif|ferent cau&s;e for the di&s;u&s;e of jury-trials in inferior courts. Were the ancient records pre&s;erved of the&s;e inferior courts, it would, I pre&s;ume, be found, that civil cau&s;es were tried in them by juries, even after the in&s;ti|tution of the college of ju&s;tice; and indeed we are not at freedom to doubt of this fact, after con&s;idering the act 42. p. 1587, ap|pointing mole&s;tations to be tried by a jury before the &s;heriff. In the records indeed of the &s;heriff's court of Edinburgh, there is
<PB N="417" REF="427">
not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige remaining of a jury|trial in a civil action. But this circum|&s;tance created no great perplexity, becau&s;e the records of that court are not pre&s;erved farther back than the year 1595. I had little expectation of more ancient records in other &s;heriffdoms; but conjecturing that the old form of jury-trials might wear out more &s;lowly in &s;hires remote from the capital, I continued to &s;earch, and in the record, luckily &s;tumbled upon a book of the &s;he|riff's court of Orkney, beginning 3d July 1602, and ending 29th Augu&s;t 1604. All the proce&s;&s;es engro&s;&s;ed in this book, civil as well as criminal, are tried by juries. That juries at the long-run wore out of u&s;e in in|ferior courts, will not be &s;urpri&s;ing, when it is con&s;idered, that an appetite for power, as well as for imitating the manners of our &s;uperiors, do not for&s;ake us when we are made judges. It is probable al&s;o, that this innovation was favoured by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, willing to have under their power of review, iniquitous judg|ments
<PB N="418" REF="428">
with relation to matters of fact, from which review they were debarred, when facts were a&s;certained by the verdict of a jury.</P>
<P>FROM the power which courts have to review the decrees of inferior judges, I pro|ceed to the power which courts have to re|view their own decrees. The court of ju|&s;ticiary enjoys not this power, becau&s;e the verdict is ultimate, and cannot be over|turned. This ob&s;tacle lyes not in the way of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; and as the forms of this court give opportunity for &s;uch re|view, nece&s;&s;ity brought it early into prac|tice. For the &s;hort &s;ederunts of parlia|ment would have rendered appeals, when multiplied, an impracticable remedy. It was nece&s;&s;ary therefore to find a remedy in the court it&s;elf, which was obtained by a&s;&s;uming a power to reduce its own de|crees. And &s;o an appeal came to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e ca&s;es only where the ulti|mate judgment of the court is unju&s;t. This
<PB N="419" REF="429">
is the very rea&s;on, according to Balfour, which moved the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to reduce its own decrees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 268.</NOTE>. The admiralty is the only other court in Scotland that hath a privilege to review its own decrees; and this privilege is be&s;towed by the act 16. p. 1681.</P>
<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed what occurred upon our courts in the three fir&s;t views, I proceed to con&s;ider a court of appeal; upon which I ob&s;erve in general, that in its powers it is more limited, than where it enjoys al&s;o an original juri&s;diction. The province of a court of appeal, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is not to try the cau&s;e, but to try the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence appealed from. All that can be done by the court of appeal, is to examine whether the interlocutor or &s;entence be ju&s;t|ly founded upon the pleadings. If any new point be &s;ugge&s;ted, the court of appeal, having no original juri&s;diction, cannot take more upon it, than to remit this point to
<PB N="420" REF="430">
be tried in the court below. A court which, along with its power of receiving appeals, hath al&s;o an original juri&s;diction in the &s;ame cau&s;es, cannot only rectify any wrong done by the inferior court, but has further an option, either to remit the cau&s;e thus amended to the court below, or to retain it to it&s;elf, and proceed to the final determination.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of Lords is undoubtedly a court of appeal, with re&s;pect to the three &s;overeign courts in this country. There are appeals daily from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. Appeals from the court of ju&s;ticiary have hitherto been rare, and probably will never become frequent. The proceedings of this court, being brought under preci&s;e rules, af|ford little matter for an appeal; which at the &s;ame time would be but a partial re|medy, as the verdict of the jury can never be called in que&s;tion. An appeal however from this court is competent, as well as from the &s;e&s;&s;ion; of which there is one
<PB N="421" REF="431">
noted in&s;tance. The King's advocate and the procurator for the Kirk pro&s;ecuted the magi&s;trates of Elgin before the ju&s;ticiary, for an attrocious riot; &s;pecifying, that be|ing entru&s;ted by the mini&s;ters of Elgin with the keys of the little kirk of Elgin, in&s;tead of re&s;toring them when required, they had delivered them to Mr. Blair epi&s;copal mi|ni&s;ter, by which the e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ters were turned out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In this ca&s;e the following circum&s;tance came to be ma|terial to the i&s;&s;ue, whether the &s;aid little kirk was or was not a part of the pari&s;h church. The affirmative being found by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, to which the point of right was remitted as preliminary to the criminal trial, the magi&s;trates entered an appeal from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and upon that pretext craved from the court of ju|&s;ticiary a &s;tay of further proceedings till the appeal &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The pro&s;ecutors oppo&s;ed this demand, founded on an order of the hou&s;e of Lords, 19th April 1709, re&s;olving, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That an appeal neither &s;tays
<PB N="422" REF="432">
proce&s;s nor &s;i&s;ts execution, unle&s;s the ap|peal be received by the hou&s;e, an order made for the re&s;pondent to an&s;wer, and the order duly &s;erved on the re&s;pondent;"</Q> and urged, that this not being done in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the court ought to proceed. The court accordingly proceeded in the trial, and pronounced &s;entence, 2d March 1713, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ordaining the pannels to deliver up the keys of the little kirk, with 20<HI>l.</HI> of fine, and 30<HI>l.</HI> of expences."</Q> The defendants, who in a criminal pro|&s;ecution are with us called pannels, ap|pealed al&s;o from this &s;entence of the court of ju&s;ticiary, and the &s;entence was re|ver&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinctions above handled, com|prehend mo&s;t of the courts that are to be found any where, but do not totally ex|hau&s;t them. We have many in&s;tances in Britain, of a new juri&s;diction erected for a particular purpo&s;e and for no other. This for the mo&s;t part happens, when a fact is
<PB N="423" REF="433">
made criminal by &s;tatute, and to be tried by certain per&s;ons named for that preci&s;e purpo&s;e; or where a new and &s;evere puni&s;h|ment is directed again&s;t what was formerly reckoned a venial tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; as for in|&s;tance, the &s;tatute 1&s;t George I. cap. 18. again&s;t the malicious de&s;troying growing trees, which impowers the ju&s;tices of peace to try this crime. This al&s;o &s;ometimes hap|pens in civil cau&s;es; witne&s;s the juri&s;diction given by act of parliament to the ju&s;tices of peace in revenue matters. With rela|tion to &s;uch courts, the que&s;tion of the greate&s;t importance is, Whether they be &s;ubject to any review. The author of a new abridgment of the law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. page 592.</NOTE>, talking of the King's bench, has the following pa&s;&s;age. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Al&s;o it hath &s;o &s;overeign a juri&s;diction in all criminal matters, that an act of parliament, appointing all crimes of a certain denomination to be tried before certain judges, doth not exclude the ju|ri&s;diction of this court, without expre&s;s
<PB N="424" REF="434">
negative words. And therefore it hath been re&s;olved, that 33d Henry VIII. cap. 12. which enacts, <HI>That all trea&s;ons within the King's hou&s;e &s;hall be determined before the Lord &s;teward,</HI> doth not re&s;train this court from proceeding again&s;t &s;uch offences. But where a &s;tatute creates a new offence, which was not taken notice of by the common law, erects a new ju|ri&s;diction for the puni&s;hment of it, and pre&s;cribes a certain method of proceed|ing; it &s;eems que&s;tionable how far this court has an implied juri&s;diction in &s;uch a ca&s;e."</Q> The di&s;tinction here &s;ugge&s;ted, with &s;ome degree of he&s;itation, is, in my apprehen&s;ion, &s;olidly founded on a clear rule of law. A right e&s;tabli&s;hed in any court, or in any per&s;on, is not pre&s;umed to be taken away; and therefore cannot other|wi&s;e be taken away but by expre&s;s words. On the other hand, a right is not pre&s;um|ed to be given, and therefore cannot be given but by expre&s;s words. Trea&s;on of all &s;orts, wherever committed, is under the ju|ri&s;diction
<PB N="425" REF="435">
of the King's bench; and a &s;tatute impowering the Lord &s;teward to try trea&s;on committed within the King's hou&s;e, be&s;tows upon him, in this particular, a cumulative juri&s;diction with the King's bench; but not an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction, becau&s;e the words do not nece&s;&s;arily im|ply &s;o much. A new offence created by a &s;tatute, mu&s;t be con&s;idered in a different light. If the trial of &s;uch offence be com|mitted to a particular judge, there is no foundation in law for extending the pri|vilege to any other judge; becau&s;e the words do not nece&s;&s;arily import &s;uch exten|&s;ion. The ju&s;ticiary therefore, or &s;heriff, have no power to inflict the &s;tatutory pu|ni&s;hment upon tho&s;e who maliciou&s;ly de|&s;troy growing trees. They have evident|ly no &s;uch juri&s;diction by the &s;tatute, and they cannot have it by common law, be|cau&s;e the puni&s;hment is not directed by the common law.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="436">
ONE que&s;tion there is relative to courts of all kinds, and that is, How is the ex|tent of their juri&s;diction to be tried, and who is the judge in this ca&s;e? This is a matter of no difficulty. It is inherent in the nature of every court, to judge of its own juri&s;diction, and, with re&s;pect to all cau&s;es, to determine whether they come or come not under its cogni&s;ance. For to &s;ay, that this que&s;tion, even at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, mu&s;t be determined by another court, involves the following ab&s;urdity, that no cau&s;e can be taken in by any court, till antecedently it be found compe|tent by the judgment of a &s;uperior court. This therefore is one civil que&s;tion, to which every court, civil, criminal, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, mu&s;t be competent. As this preliminary que&s;tion mu&s;t, before entering upon the cau&s;e, be determined, if di&s;puted, or be taken for granted, if not di&s;puted, the power to judge of it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be implied, wherever a court is e&s;tabli&s;hed and a juri&s;diction granted. A judgment how|ever
<PB N="427" REF="437">
of a court upon its own powers, ought never, in good policy, to be declared final; for this, in effect, would be to be&s;tow upon the court, however limited in its con&s;titu|tion, a power to arrogate to it&s;elf an un|bounded juri&s;diction, which would be ab|&s;urd. This doctrine &s;hall be illu&s;trated, by applying it to a very plain ca&s;e, which was di&s;puted in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. In the turnpike act for the &s;hire of Haddington, 23d George II. the tru&s;tees are impowered to make compo&s;itions with individuals for their toll. Any abu&s;e withal of the powers given by the act, is &s;ubjected to the cogni|&s;ance of the ju&s;tices of peace, who are au|thori&s;ed to rectify the &s;ame ultimately and without appeal. The tru&s;tees made a tran&s;|action with a neighbouring heretor, allow|ing tho&s;e who purcha&s;ed his coal and &s;alt the u&s;e of the turnpike-road free of toll; but obliging him to pay 3<HI>l.</HI> Sterling year|ly, whenever he &s;hould open coal in a different field &s;pecified. This bargain, an exemption in reality, and not a compo|&s;ition,
<PB N="428" REF="438">
was complained of as an abu&s;e; and upon that footing was, by the ju&s;tices of peace, declared void, and the toll ordered to be levied. The que&s;tion was, Whether this &s;entence could be reviewed by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The que&s;tion admits of a clear &s;olution, by &s;pliting the &s;entence into its two con&s;tituent parts, the fir&s;t re&s;pecting the juri&s;diction, the other re&s;pecting the cau&s;e. With regard to the la&s;t only, are the &s;entences of the ju&s;tices of peace de|clared final. With regard to the prelimi|nary point, a&s;certaining their own juri&s;dic|tion, their judgment is not final. The cau&s;e therefore may be brought before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion to try this preliminary point, and if, upon a review, it be judged, that the ju&s;tices have exceeded the limits of their juri&s;diction, the judgment they have given in the cau&s;e mu&s;t al&s;o be declared void, as <HI>ultra vires.</HI> On the other hand, if the opinion of the ju&s;tices about their own ju|ri&s;diction be affirmed, the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion mu&s;t &s;top &s;hort; and however wrong the
<PB N="429" REF="439">
judgment upon the cau&s;e may to them ap|pear, they cannot interpo&s;e, becau&s;e the judgment is final.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fini&s;h this di&s;cour&s;e with a compa|rative view of our different chief courts in point of dignity and pre-eminence. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion is &s;overeign and &s;upreme: &s;overeign, becau&s;e it is the King's court, and it is the King who executes the acts and de|crees of this court: &s;upreme, with re&s;pect to inferior courts having the &s;ame or part of the &s;ame juri&s;diction, but &s;ubjected to a review in this court. The court of ju&s;ticiary, in the foregoing re&s;pects, &s;tands preci&s;ely upon the &s;ame footing with the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The court of exchequer is &s;overeign, but not &s;upreme. I know no inferior court with which it has a cumulative juri&s;diction, and who&s;e proceedings it can review. Cau&s;es cannot be brought before the exchequer from any inferior court, whether by reduc|tion, advocation, or appeal. The admiral court again is, by the act 1681, declared
<PB N="430" REF="440">
&s;overeign, and accordingly every act of au|thority of this court goes in the King's name. It is al&s;o &s;upreme with re&s;pect to inferior admiral courts, who&s;e &s;entences it can review. But with regard to the courts of &s;e&s;&s;ion and ju&s;ticiary, it is an inferior court; becau&s;e its decrees are &s;ubjected to a review in the&s;e courts. The commi&s;&s;ary court of Edinburgh is properly the bi&s;hop's court, and not &s;overeign. With re&s;pect to its &s;upremacy, it &s;tands upon the &s;ame foot|ing with the admiral court.</P>
