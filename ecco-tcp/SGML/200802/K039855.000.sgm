<P>THE Author of the following Letters takes the liberty, with all proper deference, of laying before the public his idea of <HI>parochial hi&s;tory,</HI> which, he thinks, ought to con&s;i&s;t of natural productions and occurrences as well as anti|quities. He is al&s;o of opinion that if &s;tationary men would pay &s;ome attention to the di&s;tricts on which they re&s;ide, and would publi&s;h their thoughts re&s;pecting the objects that &s;urround them, from &s;uch materials might be drawn the mo&s;t complete county-hi&s;tories, which are &s;till wanting in &s;everal parts of this kingdom, and in particular in the county of <HI>Southampton.</HI></P>
<P>And here he &s;eizes the fir&s;t opportunity, though a late one, of returning his mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments to the reverend the Pre&s;ident and the reverend and worthy the Fellows of <HI>Magdalen College</HI> in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> for their liberal behaviour in permitting their archives to be &s;earched by a member of their own &s;ociety, &s;o far as the
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
evidences therein contained might re&s;pect the pari&s;h and priory of <HI>Selborne.</HI> To that gentleman al&s;o, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, who&s;e labours and attention could only be equalled by the very kind manner in which they were be&s;towed, many and great obligations are al&s;o due.</P>
<P>Of the authenticity of the documents above-mentioned there can be no doubt, &s;ince they con&s;i&s;t of the identical deeds and records that were removed to the College from the Priory at the time of it's di&s;&s;olution; and, being carefully copied on the &s;pot, may be depended on as genuine; and, never having been made public before, may gratify the curio&s;ity of the antiquary, as well as e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>If the writer &s;hould at all appear to have induced any of his readers to pay a more ready attention to the wonders of the Creation, too frequently overlooked as common occur|rences; or if he &s;hould by any means, through his re&s;earches, have lent an helping hand towards the enlargement of the boundaries of hi&s;torical and topographical knowledge; or if he &s;hould have thrown &s;ome &s;mall light upon ancient cu&s;|toms and manners, and e&s;pecially on tho&s;e that were mo|na&s;tic; his purpo&s;e will be fully an&s;wered. But if he &s;hould not have been &s;ucce&s;sful in any of the&s;e his inten|tions,
<PB N="v" REF="5">
yet there remains this con&s;olation behind&mdash;that the&s;e his pur&s;uits, by keeping the body and mind employed, have, under Providence, contributed to much health and cheerfulne&s;s of &s;pirits, even to old age: and, what &s;till adds to his happine&s;s, have led him to the knowledge of a circle of gentlemen who&s;e intelligent communications, as they have afforded him much plea&s;ing information, &s;o, could he flatter him&s;elf with a continuation of them, would they ever be deemed a matter of &s;ingular &s;atisfaction and improvement.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. TO THOMAS PENNANT, ESQUIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE pari&s;h of SELBORNE lies in the extreme ea&s;tern corner of the county of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> bordering on the county of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and not far from the county of <HI>Surrey;</HI> is about fifty miles &s;outh-we&s;t of <HI>London,</HI> in latitude 51, and near midway between the towns of <HI>Alton</HI> and <HI>Petersfield.</HI> Being very large and exten&s;ive it abuts on twelve pari&s;hes, two of which are in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> viz. <HI>Trotton</HI> and <HI>Rogate.</HI> If you begin from the &s;outh and proceed we&s;tward the adjacent pari&s;hes are <HI>Em&s;hot, Newton Valence, Faringdon, Harteley Mauduit, Great Ward le ham, King&s;ley, Hedleigh, Bram&s;hot, Trotton, Rogate, Ly&s;&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Greatham.</HI> The &s;oils of this di&s;trict are almo&s;t as various and diver&s;ified as the views and a&s;pects. The high part to the &s;outh-we&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of a va&s;t hill of chalk, ri&s;ing three
<PB N="2" REF="8">
hundred feet above the village; and is divided into a &s;heep down, the high wood, and a long hanging wood called <HI>The Hanger.</HI> The covert of this eminence is altogether beech, the mo&s;t lovely of all fore&s;t trees, whether we con&s;ider it's &s;mooth rind or bark, it's glo&s;&s;y foliage, or graceful pendulous boughs. The down, or &s;heep-walk, is a plea&s;ing park-like &s;pot, of about one mile by half that &s;pace, jutting out on the verge of the hill-country, where it begins to break down into the plains, and commanding a very engaging view, being an a&s;&s;emblage of hill, dale, wood-lands, heath, and water. The pro&s;pect is bounded to the &s;outh-ea&s;t and ea&s;t by the va&s;t range of mountains called <HI>The Su&s;&s;ex Downs,</HI> by <HI>Guild-down</HI> near <HI>Guildford,</HI> and by the <HI>Downs</HI> round <HI>Dorking,</HI> and <HI>Ryegate</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> to the north-ea&s;t, which altogether, with the country beyond <HI>Alton</HI> and <HI>Farnham,</HI> form a noble and ex|ten&s;ive outline.</P>
<P>At the foot of this hill, one &s;tage or &s;tep from the uplands, lies the village, which con&s;i&s;ts of one &s;ingle &s;traggling &s;treet, three quarters of a mile in length, in a &s;heltered vale, and running parallel with <HI>The Hanger.</HI> The hou&s;es are divided from the hill by a vein of &s;tiff clay (good wheat-land), yet &s;tand on a rock of white &s;tone, little in appearance removed from chalk; but &s;eems &s;o far from being calcarious, that it endures extreme heat. Yet that the free&s;tone &s;till pre&s;erves &s;omewhat that is analogous to chalk, is plain from the beeches which de&s;cend as low as tho&s;e rocks extend, and no farther, and thrive as well on them, where the ground is &s;teep, as on the chalks.</P>
<P>The cart-way of the village divides, in a remarkable manner, two very incongruous &s;oils. To the &s;outh-we&s;t is a rank clay, that requires the labour of years to render it mellow; while the gardens to the north-ea&s;t, and &s;mall enclo&s;ures behind, con&s;i&s;t of a
<PB N="3" REF="9">
warm, forward, crumbling mould, called <HI>black malm,</HI> which &s;eems highly &s;aturated with vegetable and animal manure; and the&s;e may perhaps have been the original &s;ite of the town; while the woods and coverts might extend down to the oppo&s;ite bank.</P>
<P>At each end of the village, which runs from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t, ari&s;es a &s;mall rivulet: that at the north-we&s;t end fre|quently fails; but the other is a fine perennial &s;pring, little in|fluenced by drought or wet &s;ea&s;ons, called <HI>Well-head</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This &s;pring produced, <HI>September</HI> 14, 1781, after a &s;evere hot &s;ummer, and a pre|ceding dry &s;pring and winter, nine gallons of water in a minute, which is five hundred and forty in an hour, and twelve thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty, or two hundred and &s;ixteen hog&s;heads, in twenty-four hours, or one natural day. At this time many of the wells failed, and all the ponds in the vales were dry.</NOTE>. This breaks out of &s;ome high grounds joining to <HI>Nore Hill,</HI> a noble chalk promontory, remarkable for &s;ending forth two &s;treams into two different &s;eas. The one to the &s;outh becomes a branch of the <HI>Arun,</HI> running to <HI>Arundel,</HI> and &s;o falling into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> channel: the other to the north. The <HI>Selborne</HI> &s;tream makes one branch of the <HI>Wey;</HI> and, meeting the <HI>Black-down</HI> &s;tream at <HI>Hedleigh,</HI> and the <HI>Alton</HI> and <HI>Farnham</HI> &s;tream at <HI>Tilford-bridge,</HI> &s;wells into a con&s;iderable river, navigable at <HI>Godalming;</HI> from whence it pa&s;&s;es to <HI>Guildford,</HI> and &s;o into the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Weybridge;</HI> and thus at the <HI>Nore</HI> into the <HI>German</HI> ocean.</P>
<P>Our wells, at an average, run to about &s;ixty-three feet, and when &s;unk to that depth &s;eldon fail; but produce a fine limpid water, &s;oft to the ta&s;te, and much commended by tho&s;e who drink the pure element, but which does not lather well with &s;oap.</P>
<P>To the north-we&s;t, north and ea&s;t of the village, is a range of fair enclo&s;ures, con&s;i&s;ting of what is called a <HI>white malm,</HI> a &s;ort of
<PB N="4" REF="10">
rotten or rubble &s;tone, which, when turned up to the fro&s;t and rain, moulders to pieces, and becomes manure to it&s;elf<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This &s;oil produces good wheat and clover.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Still on to the north-ea&s;t, and a &s;tep lower, is a kind of white land, neither chalk nor clay, neither fit for pa&s;ture nor for the plough, yet kindly for hops, which root deep into the free&s;tone, and have their poles and wood for charcoal growing ju&s;t at hand. This white &s;oil produces the brighte&s;t hops.</P>
<P>As the pari&s;h &s;till inclines down towards <HI>Wolmer-fore&s;t,</HI> at the juncture of the clays and &s;and the &s;oil becomes a wet, &s;andy loam, remarkable for timber, and infamous for roads. The oaks of <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Blackmoor</HI> &s;tand high in the e&s;timation of purveyors, and have furni&s;hed much naval timber; while the trees on the free&s;tone grow large, but are what workmen call <HI>&s;hakey,</HI> and &s;o brittle as often to fall to pieces in &s;awing. Beyond the &s;andy loam the &s;oil becomes an hungry lean &s;and, till it mingles with the fore&s;t; and will produce little without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lime and turnips.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>IN the court of <HI>Norton</HI> farm hou&s;e, a manor farm to the north-we&s;t of the village, on the white malms, &s;tood within the&s;e twenty years a <HI>broad-leaved elm,</HI> or <HI>wych hazel, ulmus folio lati&s;&s;imo &s;cabro</HI> of <HI>Ray,</HI> which, though it had lo&s;t a con&s;iderable leading
<PB N="5" REF="11">
bough in the great &s;torm in the year 1703, equal to a moderate tree, yet, when felled, contained eight loads of timber; and, be|ing too bulky for a carriage, was &s;awn off at &s;even feet above the butt, where it mea&s;ured near eight feet in the diameter. This elm I mention to &s;hew to what a bulk <HI>planted elms</HI> may attain; as this tree mu&s;t certainly have been &s;uch from it's &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In the centre of the village, and near the church, is a &s;quare piece of ground &s;urrounded by hou&s;es, and vulgarly called <HI>The Ple&s;tor</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vide the plate in the antiquities.</NOTE>. In the mid&s;t of this &s;pot &s;tood, in old times, a va&s;t oak, with a &s;hort &s;quat body, and huge horizontal arms extending almo&s;t to the extremity of the area. This venerable tree, &s;ur|rounded with &s;tone &s;teps, and &s;eats above them, was the delight of old and young, and a place of much re&s;ort in &s;ummer even|ings; where the former &s;at in grave debate, while the latter fro|licked and danced before them. Long might it have &s;tood, had not the amazing tempe&s;t in 1703 overturned it at once, to the infinite regret of the inhabitants, and the vicar, who be&s;towed &s;everal pounds in &s;etting it in it's place again: but all his care could not avail; the tree &s;prouted for a time, then withered and died. This oak I mention to &s;hew to what a bulk <HI>planted oaks</HI> al&s;o may arrive: and planted this tree mu&s;t certainly have been, as will appear from what will be &s;aid farther concerning this area, when we enter on the antiquities of <HI>Selborne.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>Blackmoor</HI> e&s;tate there is a &s;mall wood called <HI>Lo&s;el</HI>'s, of a few acres, that was lately furni&s;hed with a &s;et of oaks of a pe|culiar growth and great value; they were tall and taper like firs, but &s;tanding near together had very &s;mall heads, only a little bru&s;h without any large limbs. About twenty years ago the
<PB N="6" REF="12">
bridge at the <HI>Toy,</HI> near <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> being much decayed, &s;ome trees were wanted for the repairs that were fifty feet long without bough, and would mea&s;ure twelve inches diameter at the little end. Twenty &s;uch trees did a purveyor find in this little wood, with this advantage, that many of them an&s;wered the de&s;crip|tion at &s;ixty feet. The&s;e trees were &s;old for twenty pounds apiece.</P>
<P>In the centre of this grove there &s;tood an oak, which, though &s;hapely and tall on the whole, bulged out into a large excre&s;cence about the middle of the &s;tem. On this a pair of ravens had fixed their re&s;idence for &s;uch a &s;eries of years, that the oak was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of <HI>The Raven-tree.</HI> Many were the at|tempts of the neighbouring youths to get at this <HI>eyry:</HI> the diffi|culty whetted their inclinations, and each was ambitious of &s;ur|mounting the arduous ta&s;k. But, when they arrived at the &s;welling, it jutted out &s;o in their way, and was &s;o far beyond their gra&s;p, that the mo&s;t daring lads were awed, and acknowledged the un|dertaking to be too hazardous. So the ravens built on, ne&s;t upon ne&s;t, in perfect &s;ecurity, till the fatal day arrived in which the wood was to be levelled. It was in the month of <HI>February,</HI> when tho&s;e birds u&s;ually &s;it. The &s;aw was applied to the butt, the wedges were in&s;erted into the opening, the woods echoed to the heavy blows of the beetle or mallet, the tree nodded to it's fall; but &s;till the dam &s;at on. At la&s;t, when it gave way, the bird was flung from her ne&s;t; and, though her parental affection de&s;erved a better fate, was whipped down by the twigs, which brought her dead to the ground.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>THE fo&s;&s;il-&s;hells of this di&s;trict, and &s;orts of &s;tone, &s;uch as have fallen within my ob&s;ervation, mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. And fir&s;t I mu&s;t mention, as a great curio&s;ity, a &s;pecimen that was plowed up in the chalky fields, near the &s;ide of the <HI>Down,</HI> and given to me for the &s;ingularity of it's appearance, which, to an incurious eye, &s;eems like a petrified fi&s;h of about four inches long, the cardo pa&s;&s;ing for an head and mouth. It is in reality a <HI>bivalve</HI> of the <HI>Linnaean Genus</HI> of <HI>Mytilus,</HI> and the &s;pecies of <HI>Cri&s;ta Galli;</HI> called by <HI>Li&s;ter, Ra&s;tellum;</HI> by <HI>Rumphius, O&s;treum plicatum minus;</HI> by <HI>D'Argenville, Auris Porci,</HI> &s;. <HI>Cri&s;ta Galli;</HI> and by tho&s;e who make collections <HI>cock's comb.</HI> Though I applied to &s;everal &s;uch in London, I never could meet with an entire &s;pecimen; nor could I ever find in books any engraving from a perfect one. In the &s;uperb <HI>mu&s;eum</HI> at <HI>Leice&s;ter-hou&s;e</HI> permi&s;&s;ion was given me to exa|mine for this article; and, though I was di&s;appointed as to the fo&s;&s;il, I was highly gratified with the &s;ight of &s;everal of the &s;hells them&s;elves in high pre&s;ervation. This bivalve is only known to inhabit the <HI>Indian</HI> ocean, where it fixes it&s;elf to a <HI>zoophyte,</HI> known by the name <HI>Gorgonia.</HI> The curious foldings of the &s;uture the one into the other, the alternate flutings or grooves, and the curved form of my &s;pecimen being much ea&s;ier expre&s;&s;ed by the pencil than by words, I have cau&s;ed it to be drawn and engraved.</P>
<P><HI>Cornua Ammonis</HI> are very common about this village. As we were cutting an inclining path up <HI>The Hanger,</HI> the labourers found
<PB N="8" REF="15">
them frequently on that &s;teep, ju&s;t under the &s;oil, in the chalk, and of a con&s;iderable &s;ize. In the lane above <HI>Well-head,</HI> in the way to <HI>Em&s;hot,</HI> they abound in the bank in a darki&s;h &s;ort of marl; and are u&s;ually very &s;mall and &s;oft; but in <HI>Clay's Pond,</HI> a little far|ther on, at the end of the pit, where the &s;oil is dug out for ma|nure, I have occa&s;ionally ob&s;erved them of large dimen&s;ions, per|haps fourteen or &s;ixteen inches in diameter. But as the&s;e did not con&s;i&s;t of firm &s;tone, but were formed of a kind of <HI>terra lapido&s;a,</HI> or hardened clay, as &s;oon as they were expo&s;ed to the rains and fro&s;t they mouldered away. The&s;e &s;eemed as if they were a very recent production. In the chalk-pit, at the north-we&s;t end of <HI>The Hanger,</HI> large <HI>nautili</HI> are &s;ometimes ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>In the very thicke&s;t &s;trata of our free&s;tone, and at con&s;iderable depths, well-diggers often find large <HI>&s;callops</HI> or <HI>pectines,</HI> having both &s;hells deeply &s;triated, and ridged and furrowed alternately. They are highly impregnated with, if not wholly compo&s;ed of, the &s;tone of the quarry.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER IV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AS in a former letter the <HI>free&s;tone</HI> of this place has been only mentioned incidentally, I &s;hall here become more particular.</P>
<P>This &s;tone is in great reque&s;t for hearth-&s;tones, and the beds of ovens: and in lining of lime-kilns it turns to good account; for the workmen u&s;e &s;andy loam in&s;tead of mortar; the &s;and of which fluxes, <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">There may probably be al&s;o in the chalk it&s;elf that is burnt for lime a proportion of &s;and: for few chalks are &s;o pure as to have none.</NOTE> and runs by the inten&s;e heat, and &s;o ca&s;es over the
<PB N="9" REF="16">
whole face of the kiln with a &s;trong vitrified coat like gla&s;s, that it is well pre&s;erved from injuries of weather, and endures thirty or forty years. When chi&s;eled &s;mooth, it makes elegant fronts for hou&s;es, equal in colour and grain to the <HI>Bath</HI> &s;tone; and &s;u|perior in one re&s;pect, that, when &s;ea&s;oned, it does not &s;cale. De|cent chimney-pieces are worked from it of much clo&s;er and finer grain than <HI>Portland;</HI> and rooms are floored with it; but it proves rather too &s;oft for this purpo&s;e. It is a free&s;tone, cutting in all directions; yet has &s;omething of a grain parallel with the horizon, and therefore &s;hould not be <HI>&s;urbedded,</HI> but laid in the &s;ame po&s;ition that it grows in the quarry<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">To <HI>&s;urbed</HI> &s;tone is to &s;et it edgewi&s;e, contrary to the po&s;ture it had in the quarry, &s;ays Dr. <HI>Plot.

On the ground abroad this fire|&s;tone will not &s;ucceed for pavements, becau&s;e, probably &s;ome de|gree of &s;altne&s;s prevailing within it, the rain tears the &s;labs to pieces<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Fire&s;tone is full of &s;alts, and has no &s;ulphur: mu&s;t be clo&s;e grained, and have no inter&s;tices.

Though this &s;tone is too hard to be acted on by vinegar; yet both the white part, and even the <HI>blue rag,</HI> ferments &s;trongly in mineral acids. Though the white &s;tone will not bear wet, yet in every quarry at intervals there are thin &s;trata of <HI>blue rag,</HI> which re&s;i&s;t rain and fro&s;t; and are excellent for pitching of &s;tables, paths and courts, and for building of dry walls again&s;t banks; a valuable &s;pecies of fencing, much in u&s;e in this village, and for mending of roads. This <HI>rag</HI> is rugged and &s;tubborn, and will not hew to a &s;mooth face; but is very durable: yet, as the&s;e &s;trata are &s;hallow and lie deep, large quantities cannot be procured but at con&s;ider|able expen&s;e. Among the <HI>blue rags</HI> turn up &s;ome blocks tinged

Being often found in broad flat pieces, it makes good pavement for paths about hou&s;es, never becoming &s;lippery in fro&s;t or rain; is excellent for dry walls, and is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in buildings.

<P>AMONG the &s;ingularities of this place the two rocky hollow lanes, the one to <HI>Alton,</HI> and the other to the fore&s;t, de&s;erve our attention. The&s;e roads, running through the malm lands, are, by the traffick of ages, and the fretting of water, worn down through the fir&s;t &s;tratum of our free&s;tone, and partly through the &s;econd; &s;o that they look more like water-cour&s;es than roads; and are bedded with naked <HI>rag</HI> for furlongs together. In many places they are reduced &s;ixteen or eighteen feet beneath the level of the fields; and after floods, and in fro&s;ts, exhibit very grote&s;que and wild appearances, from the tangled roots that are twi&s;ted among the &s;trata, and from the torrents ru&s;hing down their broken &s;ides; and e&s;pecially when tho&s;e ca&s;cades are frozen into icicles, hanging in all the fanciful &s;hapes of fro&s;t-work. The&s;e rugged gloomy &s;cences affright the ladies when they peep down into them from the paths above, and make timid hor&s;emen &s;hudder while they ride along them; but de|light the naturali&s;t with their various botany, and particularly with their curious <HI>filices</HI> with which they abound.</P>
<P>The manor of <HI>Selborne,</HI> was it &s;trictly looked after, with all it's kindly a&s;pects, and all it's &s;loping coverts, would &s;warm with game; even now hares, partridges, and phea&s;ants abound; and in old days woodcocks were as plentiful. There are few quails, be|cau&s;e they more affect open fields than enclo&s;ures; after harve&s;t &s;ome few land-rails are &s;een.</P>
<P>The pari&s;h of <HI>Selborne,</HI> by taking in &s;o much of the fore&s;t, is a va&s;t di&s;trict. Tho&s;e who tread the bounds are employed part of

three days in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and are of opinion that the outline, in all it's curves and indentings, does not compri&s;e le&s;s than thirty miles.</P>
<P>The village &s;tands in a &s;heltered &s;pot, &s;ecured by <HI>The Hanger</HI> from the &s;trong we&s;terly winds. The air is &s;oft, but rather moi&s;t from the effluvia of &s;o many trees; yet perfectly healthy and free from agues.</P>
<P>The quantity of rain that falls on it is very con&s;iderable, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;o woody and mountainous a di&s;trict.

<P>This lonely domain is a very agreeable haunt for many &s;orts of wild fowls, which not only frequent it in the winter, but breed there in the &s;ummer; &s;uch as lapwings, &s;nipes, wild-ducks, and, as I have di&s;covered within the&s;e few years, teals. Partridges in va&s;t plenty are bred in good &s;ea&s;ons on the verge of this fore&s;t, into which they love to make excur&s;ions: and in particular, in the dry &s;ummer of 1740 and 1741, and &s;ome years after, they &s;warmed to &s;uch a degree that parties of unrea&s;onable &s;port&s;men killed twenty and &s;ometimes thirty brace in a day.</P>
<P>But there was a nobler &s;pecies of game in this fore&s;t, now ex|tinct, which I have heard old people &s;ay abounded much before &s;hooting flying became &s;o common, and that was the <HI>heath-cock, black game,</HI> or <HI>grou&s;e.</HI> When I was a little boy I recollect one coming now and then to my father's table. The la&s;t pack remem|bered was killed about thirty-five years ago; and within the&s;e ten years one &s;olitary <HI>grey hen</HI> was &s;prung by &s;ome beagles in beating for a hare. The &s;port&s;men cried out, <Q REND="inline">"A hen phea&s;ant;"</Q> but a gentleman pre&s;ent, who had often &s;een grou&s;e in the north of Eng|land, a&s;&s;ured me that it was a greyhen.</P>

There is an old keeper, now alive, named <HI>Adams,</HI> who&s;e great grandfather (mentioned in a perambulation taken in 1635) grandfather, father and &s;elf, enjoyed the head keeper&s;hip of <HI>Wol|mer fore&s;t</HI> in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for more than an hundred years. This per&s;on a&s;&s;ures me, that his father has often told him, that Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> as &s;he was journeying on the <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> road, did not think the fore&s;t of <HI>Wolmer</HI> beneath her royal regard. For &s;he came out of the great road at <HI>Lippock,</HI> which is ju&s;t by, and, repo&s;ing her&s;elf on a bank &s;moothed for that purpo&s;e, lying about half a mile to the ea&s;t of <HI>Wolmer-pond,</HI> and &s;till called <HI>Queen's-bank,</HI> &s;aw with great complacency and &s;atisfaction the whole herd of red deer brought by the keepers along the yale before her, con&s;i&s;ting then of about five hundred head. A &s;ight this worthy the attention of the greate&s;t &s;overeign! But he farther adds that, by means of the <HI>Wal|tham blacks,</HI> or, to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as they began <HI>blacking,</HI> they were reduced to about fifty head, and &s;o con|tinued decrea&s;ing till the time of the late Duke of <HI>Cumberland.</HI> It is now more than thirty years ago that his highne&s;s &s;ent down an hunt&s;man, and &s;ix yeomen-prickers, in &s;carlet jackets laced with gold, attended by the &s;tag-hounds; ordering them to take every deer in this fore&s;t alive, and to convey them in carts to <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer they caught every &s;tag, &s;ome of which &s;hewed extraordinary diver&s;ion: but, in the following winter, when the hinds were al&s;o carried off, &s;uch fine cha&s;es were exhibited as &s;erved the country people for matter of talk and wonder for years afterwards.

<P>THOUGH large herds of deer do much harm to the neighbour|hood, yet the injury to the morals of the people is of more mo|ment than the lo&s;s of their crops. The temptation is irre&s;i&s;tible; for mo&s;t men are &s;port&s;men by con&s;titution: and there is &s;uch an inherent &s;pirit for hunting in human nature, as &s;carce any inhibi|tions can re&s;train. Hence, towards the beginning of this cen|tury all this country was wild about deer-&s;tealing. Unle&s;s he was a <HI>hunter,</HI> as they affected to call them&s;elves, no young per&s;on was allowed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of manhood or gallantry.

<P>Our old race of deer-&s;tealers are hardly extinct yet: it was but a little while ago that, over their ale, they u&s;ed to recount the ex|ploits of their youth; &s;uch as watching the pregnant hind to her lair, and, when the calf was dropped, paring it's feet with a penknife to the quick to prevent it's e&s;cape, till it was large and fat enough to be killed; the &s;hooting at one of their neighbours with a bullet in a turnip-field by moon&s;hine, mi&s;taking him for a deer; and the lo&s;ing a dog in the following extraordinary manner:&mdash;Some fellows, &s;u&s;pecting that a calf new-fallen was depo&s;ited in a certain &s;pot of thick fern, went, with a lurcher, to &s;urpri&s;e it; when the parent|hind ru&s;hed out of the brake, and, taking a va&s;t &s;pring with all her feet clo&s;e together, pitched upon the neck of the dog, and broke it &s;hort in two.</P>
<P>Another temptation to idlene&s;s and &s;porting was a number of rabbits, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the hillocks and dry places: but the&s;e being inconvenient to the hunt&s;men, on account of their burrows, when they came to take away the deer, they permitted the coun|try people to de&s;troy them all.</P>
<P>Such fore&s;ts and wa&s;tes, when their allurements to irregularities are removed, are of con&s;iderable &s;ervice to neighbourhoods that verge upon them, by furni&s;hing them with peat and turf for their firing; with fuel for the burning their lime; and with a&s;hes for their gra&s;&s;es; and by maintaining their gee&s;e and their &s;tock of young cattle at little or no expen&s;e.</P>

<P>By a <HI>perambulation</HI> of <HI>Wolmer fore&s;t</HI> and <HI>The Holt,</HI> made in 1635, and in the eleventh year of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t (which now lies before me), it appears that the limits of the former are much circum|&s;cribed. For, to &s;ay nothing of the farther &s;ide, with which I am not &s;o well acquainted, the bounds on this &s;ide, in old times, came into <HI>Bin&s;wood;</HI> and extended to the ditch of <HI>Ward le ham-park,</HI> in which &s;tands the curious mount called <HI>King John's Hill,</HI> and <HI>Lodge Hill;</HI> and to the verge of <HI>Hartley Mauduit,</HI> called <HI>Mauduit-hatch;</HI> comprehending al&s;o <HI>Short-heath, Oakhanger,</HI> and <HI>Oakwoods;</HI> a large di&s;trict, now private property, though once belonging to the royal domain.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the term <HI>purlieu</HI> is never once mentioned in this long roll of parchment. It contains, be&s;ides the <HI>perambulation,</HI> a rough e&s;timate of the value of the timbers, which were con&s;ider|able, growing at that time in the di&s;trict of <HI>The Holt;</HI> and enu|merates the officers, &s;uperior and inferior, of tho&s;e joint fore&s;ts, for the time being, and their o&s;ten&s;ible fees and perqui&s;ites. In tho&s;e days, as at pre&s;ent, there were hardly any trees in <HI>Wolmer fore&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Within the pre&s;ent limits of the fore&s;t are three con&s;iderable lakes, <HI>Hogmer, Cranmer,</HI> and <HI>Wolmer;</HI> all of which are &s;tocked with carp, tench, eels, and perch: but the fi&s;h do not thrive well, becau&s;e the water is hungry, and the bottoms are a naked &s;and.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance re&s;pecting the&s;e ponds, though by no means peculiar to them, I cannot pa&s;s over in &s;ilence; and that is, that in&s;tinct by which in &s;ummer all the kine, whether oxen, cows,

calves, or heifers, retire con&s;tantly to the water during the hotter hours; where, being more exempt from flies, and inhaling the cool|ne&s;s of that element, &s;ome belly deep, and &s;ome only to mid-leg, they ruminate and &s;olace them&s;elves from about ten in the morning till four in the afternoon, and then return to their feeding. During this great proportion of the day they drop much dung, in which in&s;ects ne&s;tle; and &s;o &s;upply food for the fi&s;h, which would be poorly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted but from this contingency. Thus Nature, who is a great economi&s;t, converts the recreation of one animal to the &s;upport of another! <HI>Thom&s;on,</HI> who was a nice ob&s;erver of natural occur|rences, did not let this plea&s;ing circum&s;tance e&s;cape him.

<P><HI>Wolmer-pond,</HI> &s;o called, I &s;uppo&s;e, for eminence &s;ake, is a va&s;t lake for this part of the world, containing, in it's whole circumfe|rence, 2646 yards, or very near a mile and an half. The length of the north-we&s;t and oppo&s;ite &s;ide is about 704 yards, and the breadth of the &s;outh-we&s;t end about 456 yards. This mea&s;ure|ment, which I cau&s;ed to be made with good exactne&s;s, gives an area of about &s;ixty-&s;ix acres, exclu&s;ive of a large irregular arm at the north-ea&s;t corner, which we did not take into the reckoning.</P>
<P>On the face of this expan&s;e of waters, and perfectly &s;ecure from fowlers, lie all day long, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, va&s;t flocks of ducks, teals, and wigeons, of various denominations; where they preen and &s;olace, and re&s;t them&s;elves, till towards &s;un-&s;et, when they i&s;&s;ue forth in little parties (for in their natural &s;tate they are all

birds of the night) to feed in the brooks and meadows; returning again with the dawn of the morning. Had this lake an arm or two more, and were it planted round with thick covert (for now it is perfectly naked), it might make a valuable decoy.</P>
<P>Yet neither it's extent, nor the clearne&s;s of it's water, nor the re&s;ort of various and curious fowls, nor it's picture&s;que groups of cattle, can render this <HI>meer</HI> &s;o remarkable as the great quantity of coins that were found in it's bed about forty years ago.

<P>The grantees that the author remembers are Brigadier-General <HI>Emanuel Scroope Howe,</HI> and his lady, <HI>Ruperta,</HI> who was a natural daughter of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> by <HI>Margaret Hughs;</HI> a Mr. <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> of

the <HI>Peterborough</HI> family, who married a dowager Lady <HI>Pembroke; Henry Bil&s;on Legge</HI> and lady; and now Lord <HI>Stawel,</HI> their &s;on.</P>
<P>The lady of General <HI>Howe</HI> lived to an advanced age, long &s;urviving her hu&s;band; and, at her death, left behind her many curious pieces of mechani&s;m of her father's con&s;tructing, who was a di&s;tingui&s;hed mechanic and arti&s;t<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">This prince was the inventor of <HI>mezzotinto.</HI></NOTE>, as well as warrior; and, among the re&s;t, a very complicated clock, lately in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Elmer,</HI> the celebrated game-painter at <HI>Farnham,</HI> in the county of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>Though the&s;e two fore&s;ts are only parted by a narrow range of enclo&s;ures, yet no two &s;oils can be more different: for <HI>The Holt</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;trong loam, of a miry nature, carrying a good turf, and abounding with oaks that grow to be large timber; while <HI>Wolmer</HI> is nothing but a hungry, &s;andy, barren wa&s;te.</P>
<P>The former, being all in the pari&s;h of <HI>Bin&s;ted,</HI> is about two miles in extent from north to &s;outh, and near as much from ea&s;t to we&s;t; and contains within it many woodlands and lawns, and the <HI>great lodge</HI> where the grantees re&s;ide; and a &s;maller lodge called <HI>Goo&s;e-green;</HI> and is abutted on by the pari&s;hes of <HI>King&s;ley, Frin&s;ham, Farnham,</HI> and <HI>Bentley;</HI> all of which have right of com|mon.</P>
<P>One thing is remarkable; that, though <HI>The Holt</HI> has been of old well &s;tocked with fallow-deer, unre&s;trained by any pales or fences more than a common hedge, yet they were never &s;een within the limits of <HI>Wolmer;</HI> nor were the red deer of <HI>Wolmer</HI> ever known to haunt the thickets or glades of <HI>The Holt.</HI></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the deer of <HI>The Holt</HI> are much thinned and reduced by the night-hunters, who perpetually hara&s;s them in &s;pite of the

efforts of numerous keepers, and the &s;evere penalties that have been put in force again&s;t them as often as they have been detected, and rendered liable to the la&s;h of the law.

Nay, &s;ome young martins remained in their ne&s;ts la&s;t year &s;o late as <HI>September</HI> the twenty-ninth; and yet they totally di&s;appeared with us by the fifth of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>How &s;trange is it that the <HI>&s;wift,</HI> which &s;eems to live exactly the &s;ame life with the <HI>&s;wallow</HI> and <HI>hou&s;e-martin,</HI> &s;hould leave us before the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> invariably! while the latter &s;tay often till the middle of <HI>October;</HI> and once I &s;aw numbers of hou&s;e-martins on the &s;eventh of <HI>November.</HI> The martins and <HI>red-wing fieldfares</HI> were flying in &s;ight together; an uncommon a&s;&s;em|blage of &s;ummer and winter-birds!</P>
<P>A little yellow bird (it is either a &s;pecies of the <HI>alauda trivialis,</HI> or rather perhaps of the <HI>motacilla trochilus</HI>) &s;till continues to make a &s;ibilous &s;hivering noi&s;e in the tops of tall woods. The <HI>&s;toparola</HI> of <HI>Ray</HI> (for which we have as yet no name in the&s;e parts) is called; in your <HI>Zoology,</HI> the <HI>fly-catcher.</HI> There is one circum&s;tance charac|teri&s;tic of this bird, which &s;eems to have e&s;caped ob&s;ervation, and that is, it takes it's &s;tand on the top of &s;ome &s;take or po&s;t, from whence it &s;prings forth on it's prey, catching a fly in the air, and hardly ever touching the ground, but returning &s;till to the &s;ame &s;tand for many times together.</P>
<P>I perceive there are more than one &s;pecies of the <HI>motacilla trochilus:</HI> Mr. <HI>Derham</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, in <HI>Ray's Philo&s;. Letters,</HI> that he has di&s;covered three. In the&s;e there is again an in&s;tance of &s;ome very common birds that have as yet no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> name.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="36">
Mr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> makes a que&s;tion whether the <HI>black-cap (motacilla atricapilla)</HI> be a bird of pa&s;&s;age or not: I think there is no doubt of it: for, in <HI>April,</HI> in the fir&s;t fine weather, they come trooping, all at once, into the&s;e parts, but are never &s;een in the winter. They are delicate &s;ong&s;ters.</P>
<P>Numbers of <HI>&s;nipes</HI> breed every &s;ummer in &s;ome moory ground on the verge of this pari&s;h. It is very amu&s;ing to &s;ee the cock bird on wing at that time, and to hear his piping and humming notes.</P>
<P>I have had no opportunity yet of procuring any of tho&s;e mice which I mentioned to you in town. The per&s;on that brought me the la&s;t &s;ays they are plenty in harve&s;t, at which time I will take care to get more; and will endeavour to put the matter out of doubt, whether it be a non-de&s;cript &s;pecies or not.</P>

<P>IT will not be without impatience that I &s;hall wait for your thoughts with regard to the <HI>falco;</HI> as to it's weight, breadth, &amp;c. I wi&s;h I had &s;et them down at the time: but, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, it weighed two pounds and eight ounces, and mea|&s;ured, from wing to wing, thirty-eight inches. It's <HI>cere</HI> and feet were yellow, and the circle of it's eyelids a bright yellow. As it had been killed &s;ome days, and the eyes were &s;unk, I could make no good ob&s;ervation on the colour of the pupils and the <HI>irides.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t unu&s;ual birds I ever ob&s;erved in the&s;e parts were a pair of <HI>hoopoes (upupa),</HI> which came &s;everal years ago in the &s;ummer, and frequented an ornamented piece of ground, which joins to my garden, for &s;ome weeks. They u&s;ed to march about in a &s;tately manner, feeding in the walks, many times in the day; and &s;eemed
<PB N="31" REF="38">
di&s;po&s;ed to breed in my outlet; but were frighted and per&s;ecuted by idle boys, who would never let them be at re&s;t.</P>
<P>Three <HI>gro&s;s-beaks (loxia coccothrau&s;tes)</HI> appeared &s;ome years ago in my fields, in the winter; one of which I &s;hot: &s;ince that, now and then one is occa&s;ionally &s;een in the &s;ame dead &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>A <HI>cro&s;s-bill (loxia curviro&s;tra)</HI> was killed la&s;t year in this neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>Our &s;treams, which are &s;mall, and ri&s;e only at the end of the village, yield nothing but the <HI>bull's-head</HI> or <HI>miller's-thumb (gobius fluviatilis capitatus),</HI> the <HI>trout (trutta fluviatilis),</HI> the <HI>eel (anguilla), the lampern (lampaetra parva et fluviatilis),</HI> and the <HI>&s;tickle-back (pi&s;ciculus aculeatus).</HI></P>
<P>We are twenty miles from the &s;ea, and almo&s;t as many from a great river, and therefore &s;ee but little of &s;ea-birds. As to wild fowls, we have a few teems of <HI>ducks</HI> bred in the moors where the &s;nipes breed; and multitudes of <HI>widgeons</HI> and <HI>teals</HI> in hard weather frequent our lakes in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>Having &s;ome acquaintance with a tame <HI>brown owl,</HI> I find that it ca&s;ts up the fur of mice, and the feathers of birds in pellets, after the manner of hawks: when full, like a dog, it hides what it can|not eat.</P>
<P>The young of the barn-owl are not ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, as they want a con&s;tant &s;upply of fre&s;h mice: whereas the young of the brown owl will eat indi&s;criminately all that is brought; &s;nails, rats, kittens, puppies, magpies, and any kind of carrion or offal.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-martins have eggs &s;till, and &s;quab-young. The la&s;t &s;wift I ob&s;erved was about the twenty-fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> it was a &s;traggler.</P>
<P><HI>Red-&s;tarts, fly-catchers, white-throats,</HI> and <HI>reguli non cri&s;tati,</HI> &s;till appear; but I have &s;een no <HI>black-caps</HI> lately.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="39">
I forgot to mention that I once &s;aw, in <HI>Chri&s;t Church</HI> college quadrangle in <HI>Oxford,</HI> on a very &s;unny warm morning, a <HI>hou&s;e martin</HI> flying about, and &s;ettling on the parapets, &s;o late as the twentieth of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I know only two &s;pecies of <HI>bats,</HI> the common <HI>ve&s;pertilio murinus</HI> and the <HI>ve&s;pertilio auribus.</HI></P>
<P>I was much entertained la&s;t &s;ummer with a tame bat, which would take flies out of a per&s;on's hand. If you gave it any thing to eat, it brought it's wings round before the mouth, hovering and hiding it's head in the manner of birds of prey when they feed. The adroitne&s;s it &s;hewed in &s;hearing off the wings of the flies, which were always rejected, was worthy of ob&s;ervation, and plea&s;ed me much. In&s;ects &s;eemed to be mo&s;t acceptable, though it did not refu&s;e raw fle&s;h when offered: &s;o that the notion, that bats go down chimnies and gnaw men's bacon, &s;eems no improbable &s;tory. While I amu&s;ed my&s;elf with this wonderful quadruped, I &s;aw it &s;everal times confute the vulgar opinion, that bats when down on a flat furface cannot get on the wing again, by ri&s;ing with great ea&s;e from the floor. It ran, I ob&s;erved, with more di&s;patch than I was aware of; but in a mo&s;t ridiculous and grote&s;que manner.</P>
<P>Bats drink on the wing, like &s;wallows, by &s;ipping the &s;urface, as they play over pools and &s;treams. They love to frequent waters, not only for the &s;ake of drinking, but on account of in|&s;ects, which are found over them in the greate&s;t plenty. As I was going, &s;ome years ago, pretty late, in a boat from <HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>Sunbury,</HI> on a warm &s;ummer's evening, I think I &s;aw myriads of bats between the two places; the air &s;warmed with them all along the <HI>Thames,</HI> &s;o that hundreds were in &s;ight at a time.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>November 4, 1767.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT gave me no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to hear that the <HI>falco</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">This hawk proved to be the <HI>falco peregrinus;</HI> a variety.</NOTE> turned out an uncommon one. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed to have heard that I had &s;ent you a bird that you had never &s;een before; but that, I find, would be a difficult ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I have procured &s;ome of the mice mentioned in my former letters, a young one and a female with young, both of which I have pre&s;erved in brandy. From the colour, &s;hape, &s;ize, and manner of ne&s;ting, I make no doubt but that the &s;pecies is non|de&s;cript. They are much &s;maller, and more &s;lender, than the <HI>mus dome&s;ticus medius</HI> of <HI>Ray;</HI> and have more of the &s;quirrel or dor|mou&s;e colour: their belly is white; a &s;traight line along their &s;ides divides the &s;hades of their back and belly. They never enter into hou&s;es; are carried into ricks and barns with the &s;heaves; abound in harve&s;t; and build their ne&s;ts amid&s;t the &s;traws of the corn above the ground, and &s;ometimes in thi&s;tles. They breed as many as eight at a litter, in a little round ne&s;t com|po&s;ed of the blades of gra&s;s or wheat.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e ne&s;ts I procured this autumn, mo&s;t artificially platted, and compo&s;ed of the blades of wheat; perfectly round, and about the &s;ize of a cricket-ball; with the aperture &s;o inge|niou&s;ly clo&s;ed, that there was no di&s;covering to what part it
<PB N="34" REF="41">
belonged. It was &s;o compact and well filled, that it would roll acro&s;s the table without being di&s;compo&s;ed, though it contained eight little mice that were naked and blind. As this ne&s;t was perfectly full, how could the dam come at her litter re&s;pectively &s;o as to admini&s;ter a teat to each? perhaps &s;he opens different places for that purpo&s;e, adju&s;ting them again when the bu&s;ine&s;s is over: but &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly be contained her&s;elf in the ball with her young, which moreover would be daily increa&s;ing in bulk. This wonderful procreant cradle, an elegant in&s;tance of the efforts of in&s;tinct, was found in a wheat-field &s;u&s;pended in the head of a thi&s;tle.</P>
<P>A gentleman, curious in birds, wrote me word that his &s;ervant had &s;hot one la&s;t <HI>January,</HI> in that &s;evere weather, which he believed would puzzle me. I called to &s;ee it this &s;ummer, not knowing what to expect: but, the moment I took it in hand, I pronounced it the male <HI>garrulus bohemicus</HI> or <HI>German</HI> &s;ilk-tail, from the five peculiar crim&s;on tags or points which it carries at the ends of five of the &s;hort remiges. It cannot, I &s;uppo&s;e, with any propriety, be called an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> bird: and yet I &s;ee, by <HI>Ray's Philo&s;oph. Letters,</HI> that great flocks of them, feeding on haws, appeared in this kingdom in the winter of 1685.</P>
<P>The mention of haws puts me in mind that there is a total failure of that wild fruit, &s;o conducive to the &s;upport of many of the winged nation. For the &s;ame &s;evere weather, late in the &s;pring, which cut off all the produce of the more tender and curious trees, de&s;troyed al&s;o that of the more hardy and common.</P>
<P>Some birds, haunting with the mi&s;&s;el-thru&s;hes, and feeding on the berries of the yew-tree, which an&s;wered to the de&s;cription of the <HI>merula torquata</HI> or <HI>ring-ouzel,</HI> were lately &s;een in this neigh|bourhood.
<PB N="35" REF="42">
I employed &s;ome people to procure me a &s;pecimen, but without &s;ucce&s;s. See Letter VIII.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI>&mdash;Might not <HI>Canary</HI> birds be naturalized to this climate, provided their eggs were put, in the &s;pring, into the ne&s;ts of &s;ome of their congeners, as goldfinches, greenfinches, &amp;c.? Before winter perhaps they might be hardened, and able to &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>About ten years ago I u&s;ed to &s;pend &s;ome weeks yearly at <HI>Sunbury,</HI> which is one of tho&s;e plea&s;ant villages lying on the <HI>Thames,</HI> near <HI>Hampton-court.</HI> In the autumn, I could not help being much amu&s;ed with tho&s;e myriads of the &s;wallow kind which a&s;&s;emble in tho&s;e parts. But what &s;truck me mo&s;t was, that, from the time they began to congregate, for&s;aking the chimnies and hou&s;es, they roo&s;ted every night in the o&s;ier-beds of the aits of that river. Now this re&s;orting towards that element, at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;eems to give &s;ome countenance to the northern opinion (&s;trange as it is) of their retiring under water. A <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> naturali&s;t is &s;o much per&s;uaded of that fact, that he talks, in his calendar of <HI>Flora,</HI> as familiarly of the &s;wallow's going under water in the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> as he would of his poultry going to roo&s;t a little before &s;un&s;et.</P>
<P>An ob&s;erving gentleman in <HI>London</HI> writes me word that he &s;aw an hou&s;e-martin, on the twenty-third of la&s;t <HI>October,</HI> flying in and out of it's ne&s;t in the <HI>Borough.</HI> And I my&s;elf, on the twenty|ninth of la&s;t <HI>October</HI> (as I was travelling through <HI>Oxford</HI>), &s;aw four or five &s;wallows hovering round and &s;ettling on the roof of the county-ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Now is it likely that the&s;e poor little birds (which perhaps had not been hatched but a few weeks) &s;hould, at that late &s;ea&s;on of the
<PB N="36" REF="43">
year, and from &s;o midland a county, attempt a voyage to <HI>Goree</HI> or <HI>Senegal,</HI> almo&s;t as far as the <HI>equator</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Adan&s;on</HI>'s Voyage to <HI>Senegal.</HI></NOTE>?</P>
<P>I acquie&s;ce entirely in your opinion&mdash;that, though mo&s;t of the &s;wallow kind may migrate, yet that &s;ome do &s;tay behind and hide with us during the winter.</P>
<P>As to the &s;hort-winged &s;oft-billed birds, which come trooping in &s;uch numbers in the &s;pring, I am at a lo&s;s even what to &s;u&s;pect about them. I watched them narrowly this year, and &s;aw them abound till about <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> when they appeared no longer. Sub&s;i&s;t they cannot openly among us, and yet elude the eyes of the inqui&s;itive: and, as to their hiding, no man pretends to have found any of them in a torpid &s;tate in the winter. But with regard to their migration, what difficulties attend that &s;uppo&s;ition! that &s;uch feeble bad fliers (who the &s;ummer long never flit but from hedge to hedge) &s;hould be able to traver&s;e va&s;t &s;eas and continents in order to enjoy milder &s;ea&s;ons amid&s;t the regions of <HI>Africa!</HI></P>

<P>As in one of your former letters you expre&s;&s;ed the more &s;atisfac|tion from my corre&s;pondence on account of my living in the mo&s;t &s;outherly county; &s;o now I may return the compliment, and ex|pect to have my curio&s;ity gratified by your living much more to the North.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="44">
For many years pa&s;t I have ob&s;erved that towards <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> va&s;t flocks of chaffinches have appeared in the fields; many more, I u&s;ed to think, than could be hatched in any one neighbourhood. But, when I came to ob&s;erve them more narrowly, I was amazed to find that they &s;eemed to me to be almo&s;t all hens. I com|municated my &s;u&s;picions to &s;ome intelligent neighbours, who, after taking pains about the matter, declared that they al&s;o thought them all mo&s;tly females; at lea&s;t fifty to one. This extraordinary occurrence brought to my mind the remark of <HI>Linnaeus;</HI> that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"before winter all their hen chaffinches migrate through <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>Italy.</HI>"</Q> Now I want to know, from &s;ome curious per&s;on in the north, whether there are any large flocks of the&s;e finches with them in the winter, and of which &s;ex they mo&s;tly con&s;i&s;t? For, from &s;uch intelligence, one might be able to judge whether our female flocks migrate from the other end of the i&s;land, or whether they come over to us from the continent.</P>
<P>We have, in the winter, va&s;t flocks of the common linnets; more, I think, than can be bred in any one di&s;trict. The&s;e, I ob&s;erve, when the &s;pring advances, a&s;&s;emble on &s;ome tree in the &s;un&s;hine, and join all in a gentle &s;ort of chirping, as if they were about to break up their winter quarters and betake them&s;elves to their proper &s;ummer homes. It is well known, at lea&s;t, that the &s;wallows and the fieldfares do congregate with a gentle twittering before they make their re&s;pective departure.</P>
<P>You may depend on it that the bunting, <HI>emberiza miliaria,</HI> does not leave this county in the winter. In <HI>January</HI> 1767 I &s;aw &s;everal dozen of them, in the mid&s;t of a &s;evere fro&s;t, among the bu&s;hes on the downs near <HI>Andover:</HI> in our woodland enclo&s;ed di&s;trict it is a rare bird.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45">
Wagtails, both white and yellow, are with us all the winter. Quails crowd to our &s;outhern coa&s;t, and are often killed in numbers by people that go on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> in his Tracts, &s;ays that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if the wheatear <HI>(aenanthe)</HI> does not quit <HI>England,</HI> it certainly &s;hifts places; for about harve&s;t they are not to be found, where there was before great plenty of them."</Q> This well accounts for the va&s;t quantities that are caught about that time on the &s;outh downs near <HI>Lewes,</HI> where they are e&s;teemed a delicacy. There have been &s;hepherds, I have been credibly informed, that have made many pounds in a &s;ea&s;on by catching them in traps. And though &s;uch multitudes are taken, I never &s;aw (and I am well acquainted with tho&s;e parts) above two or three at a time: for they are never gregarious. They may perhaps migrate in general; and, for that purpo&s;e, draw towards the coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> in autumn: but that they do not all withdraw I am &s;ure; becau&s;e I &s;ee a few &s;tragglers in many counties, at all times of the year, e&s;pecially about warrens and &s;tone quarries.</P>
<P>I have no acquaintance, at pre&s;ent, among the gentlemen of the navy: but have written to a friend, who was a &s;ea-chaplain in the late war, de&s;iring him to look into his minutes, with re&s;pect to birds that &s;ettled on their rigging during their voyage up or down the channel. What <HI>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t</HI> &s;ays on that &s;ubject is remarkable. there were little &s;hort-winged birds frequently coming on board his &s;hip all the way from our channel quite up to the <HI>Levant,</HI> e&s;pecially before &s;qually weather.</P>
<P>What you &s;ugge&s;t, with regard to <HI>Spain,</HI> is highly probable. The winters of <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> are &s;o mild, that, in all likelihood, the &s;oft-billed birds that leave us at that &s;ea&s;on may find in&s;ects &s;ufficient to &s;upport them there.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="46">
Some young man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fortune, health, and lei&s;ure, &s;hould make an autumnal voyage into that kingdom; and &s;hould &s;pend a year there, inve&s;tigating the natural hi&s;tory of that va&s;t country.

<P>I have no friend left now at <HI>Sunbury</HI> to apply to about the &s;wallows roo&s;ting on the aits of the <HI>Thames:</HI> nor can I hear any more about tho&s;e birds which I &s;u&s;pected were <HI>merulae torquatae.</HI></P>
<P>As to the &s;mall mice, I have farther to remark, that though they hang their ne&s;ts for breeding up amid&s;t the &s;traws of the &s;tanding corn, above the ground; yet I find that, in the winter, they burrow deep in the earth, and make warm beds of gra&s;s: but their grand rendezvous &s;eems to be in corn-ricks, into which they are carried at harve&s;t. A neighbour hou&s;ed an oat-rick lately, under the thatch of which were a&s;&s;embled near an hundred, mo&s;t of which were taken; and &s;ome I &s;aw. I mea&s;ured them; and found that, from no&s;e to tail, they were ju&s;t two inches and a quarter, and their tails ju&s;t two inches long. Two of them, in a &s;cale, weighed down ju&s;t one copper halfpenny, which is about the third of an ounce avoirdupois: &s;o that I &s;uppo&s;e they are the &s;malle&s;t quadrupeds in this i&s;land. A full-grown <HI>mus medius dome&s;ticus</HI> weighs, I find, one ounce lumping weight, which is more than &s;ix times as much as the mou&s;e above; and mea&s;ures from no&s;e to rump four inches and a quarter, and the &s;ame in it's tail. We have had a very &s;evere fro&s;t and deep &s;now this month. My thermometer was one day fourteen degrees and

<P>IF &s;ome curious gentleman would procure the head of a fallow|deer, and have it di&s;&s;ected, he would find it furni&s;hed with two &s;piracula, or breathing-places, be&s;ides the no&s;trils; probably analogous to the <HI>puncta lachrymalia</HI> in the human head. When deer are thir&s;ty they plunge their no&s;es, like &s;ome hor&s;es, very deep under water, while in the act of drinking, and continue them in that &s;ituation for a con&s;iderable time: but, to obviate any incon|veniency, they can open two vents, one at the inner corner of each eye, having a communication with the no&s;e. Here &s;eems to be an extraordinary provi&s;ion of nature worthy our attention; and which has not, that I know of, been noticed by any naturali&s;t. For it looks as if the&s;e creatures would not be &s;uffocated, though both their mouths and no&s;trils were &s;topped. This curious form|ation of the head may be of &s;ingular &s;ervice to bea&s;ts of cha&s;e, by

<P>SOME intelligent country people have a notion that we have, in the&s;e parts, a &s;pecies of the <HI>genus mu&s;telinum,</HI> be&s;ides the wea&s;el, &s;toat, ferret, and polecat; a little reddi&s;h bea&s;t, not much bigger than a field mou&s;e, but much longer, which they call a <HI>cane.</HI> This piece of intelligence can be little depended on; but farther inquiry may be made.</P>
<P>A gentleman in this neighbourhood had two milkwhite rooks in one ne&s;t. A booby of a carter, finding them before they were able to fly, threw them down and de&s;troyed them, to the regret of the owner, who would have been glad to have pre&s;erved &s;uch a curi|ofity in his rookery. I &s;aw the birds my&s;elf nailed again&s;t the end of a barn, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that their bills, legs, feet, and claws were milkwhite.</P>
<P>A &s;hepherd &s;aw, as he thought, &s;ome white larks on a down above my hou&s;e this winter: were not the&s;e the <HI>emberiza nivalis,</HI> the &s;now-flake of the <HI>Brit. Zool.?</HI> No doubt they were.</P>
<P>A few years ago I &s;aw a cock bullfinch in a cage, which had been caught in the fields after it was come to it's full colours. In about a year it began to look dingy; and, blackening every &s;ucceeding year, it became coal-black at the end of four. It's chief food was hemp&s;eed. Such influence has food on the colour of animals! The pied and mottled colours of dome&s;ticated ani|mals are &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to high, various, and unu&s;ual food.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="50">
I had remarked, for years, that the root of the cuckoo-pint <HI>(arum)</HI> was frequently &s;cratched out of the dry banks of hedges, and eaten in &s;evere &s;nowy weather. After ob&s;erving, with &s;ome exactne&s;s, my&s;elf, and getting others to do the &s;ame, we found it was the thru&s;h kind that &s;earched it out. The root of the <HI>arum</HI> is remarkably warm and pungent.</P>
<P>Our flocks of female chaffinches have not yet for&s;aken us. The blackbirds and thru&s;hes are very much thinned down by that fierce weather in <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>In the middle of <HI>February</HI> I di&s;covered, in my tall hedges, a little bird that rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity: it was of that yellow-green colour that belongs to the <HI>&s;alicaria</HI> kind, and, I think, was &s;oft-billed. It was no <HI>parus;</HI> and was too long and too big for the golden|crowned wren, appearing mo&s;t like the large&s;t willow-wren. It hung &s;ometimes with it's back downwards, but never continuing one moment in the &s;ame place. I &s;hot at it, but it was &s;o de&s;ultory that I mi&s;&s;ed my aim.</P>
<P>I wonder that the &s;tone curlew, <HI>charadrius oedicnemus,</HI> &s;hould be mentioned by the writers as a rare bird: it abounds in all the campaign parts of <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and breeds, I think, all the &s;ummer, having young ones, I know, very late in the autumn. Already they begin clamouring in the evening. They cannot, I think, with any propriety, be called, as they are by Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"<HI>circa aquas ver&s;antes;</HI>"</Q> for with us, by day at lea&s;t, they haunt only the mo&s;t dry, open, upland fields and &s;heep walks, far re|moved from water: what they may do in the night I cannot &s;ay. Worms are their u&s;ual food, but they al&s;o eat toads and frogs.</P>
<P>I can &s;hew you &s;ome good &s;pecimens of my <HI>new mice. Linnaeus</HI> perhaps would call the &s;pecies <HI>mus minimus.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>SELBORNE, <DATE>April 18, 1768.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the &s;tone curlew, <HI>charadrius oedicnemus,</HI> is as follows. It lays it's eggs, u&s;ually two, never more than three, on the bare ground, without any ne&s;t, in the field; &s;o that the countryman, in &s;tirring his fallows, often de&s;troys them. The young run im|mediately from the egg like partridges, &amp;c. and are withdrawn to &s;ome flinty field by the dam, where they &s;culk among the &s;tones, which are their be&s;t &s;ecurity; for their feathers are &s;o exactly of the colour of our grey &s;potted flints, that the mo&s;t exact ob&s;erver, unle&s;s he catches the eye of the young bird, may be eluded. The eggs are &s;hort and round; of a dirty white, &s;potted with dark bloody blotches. Though I might not be able, ju&s;t when I plea&s;ed, to procure you a bird, yet I could &s;hew you them almo&s;t any day; and any evening you may hear them round the village, for they make a clamour which may be heard a mile. <HI>Oedicnemus</HI> is a mo&s;t apt and expre&s;&s;ive name for them, &s;ince their legs &s;eem &s;woln like tho&s;e of a gouty man. After harve&s;t I have &s;hot them before the pointers in turnip-fields.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but there are three &s;pecies of the <HI>willow-wrens:</HI> two I know perfectly; but have not been able yet to procure the third. No two birds can differ more in their notes, and that con|&s;tantly, than tho&s;e two that I am acquainted with; for the one has a joyous, ea&s;y, laughing note; the other a har&s;h loud chirp.
<PB N="45" REF="52">
The former is every way larger, and three quarters of an inch longer, and weighs two drams and an half; while the latter weighs but two: &s;o the &s;ong&s;ter is one fifth heavier than the chirper. The chirper (being the fir&s;t &s;ummer-bird of pa&s;&s;age that is heard, the wryneck &s;ometimes excepted) begins his two notes in the middle of <HI>March,</HI> and continues them through the &s;pring and &s;ummer till the end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> as appears by my journals. The legs of the larger of the&s;e two are fle&s;h-coloured; of the le&s;s, black.</P>
<P>The <HI>gra&s;shopper-lark</HI> began his &s;ibilous note in my fields la&s;t <HI>Saturday.</HI> Nothing can be more amu&s;ing than the whi&s;per of this little bird, which &s;eems to be clo&s;e by though at an hundred yards di&s;tance; and, when clo&s;e at your ear, is &s;carce any louder than when a great way off. Had I not been a little acquainted with in&s;ects, and known that the gra&s;shopper kind is not yet hatched, I &s;hould have hardly believed but that it had been a <HI>locu&s;ta</HI> whi&s;pering in the bu&s;hes. The country people laugh when you tell them that it is the note of a bird. It is a mo&s;t art|ful creature, &s;culking in the thicke&s;t part of a bu&s;h; and will &s;ing at a yard di&s;tance, provided it be concealed. I was obliged to get a per&s;on to go on the other &s;ide of the hedge where it haunted; and then it would run, creeping like a mou&s;e, before us for an hundred yards together, through the bottom of the thorns; yet it would not come into fair &s;ight: but in a morning early, and when undi&s;turbed, it &s;ings on the top of a twig, gaping and &s;hivering with it's wings. Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> him&s;elf had no knowledge of this bird, but received his account from Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who apparently con|founds it with the <HI>reguli non cri&s;tati,</HI> from which it is very di&s;tinct. See <HI>Ray's Philo&s;. Letters,</HI> p. 108.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="53">
The fly-catcher (<HI>&s;toparola</HI>) has not yet appeared: it u&s;ually breeds in my vine. The <HI>red&s;tart</HI> begins to &s;ing: it's note is &s;hort and imperfect, but is continued till about the middle of <HI>June.</HI> The <HI>willow-wrens</HI> (the &s;maller &s;ort) are horrid pe&s;ts in a garden, de&s;troying the pea&s;e, cherries, currants, &amp;c.; and are &s;o tame that a gun will not &s;care them.</P>

<P>ON <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t arrived your agreeable letter of <HI>June</HI> the 10th. It gives me great &s;atisfaction to find that you pur&s;ue the&s;e &s;tudies &s;till with &s;uch vigour, and are in &s;uch forwardne&s;s with regard to reptiles and fi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55">
The reptiles, few as they are, I am not acquainted with, &s;o well as I could wi&s;h, with regard to their natural hi&s;tory. There is a degree of dubiou&s;ne&s;s and ob&s;curity attending the propaga|tion of this cla&s;s of animals, &s;omething analagous to that of the <HI>cryptogamia</HI> in the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem of plants: and the ca&s;e is the &s;ame with regard to &s;ome of the fi&s;hes; as the eel, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The method in which toads procreate and bring forth &s;eems to be very much in the dark. Some authors &s;ay that they are viviparous: and yet <HI>Ray</HI> cla&s;&s;es them among his oviparous ani|mals; and is &s;ilent with regard to the manner of their bringing forth. Perhaps they may be <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, as is known to be the ca&s;e with the viper.</P>
<P>The copulation of frogs (or at lea&s;t the appearance of it; for <HI>Swammerdam</HI> proves that the male has no <HI>penis intrans</HI>) is notorious to every body: becau&s;e we &s;ee them &s;ticking upon each others backs for a month together in the &s;pring: and yet I never &s;aw, or read, of toads being ob&s;erved in the &s;ame &s;ituation. It is &s;trange that the matter with regard to the venom of toads has not been yet &s;ettled. That they are not noxious to &s;ome animals is plain: for ducks, buzzards, owls, &s;tone curlews, and &s;nakes, eat them, to my knowledge, with impunity. And I well remember the time, but was not eye-witne&s;s to the fact (though numbers of per&s;ons were) when a quack, at this village, ate a toad to make the country-people &s;tare; afterwards he drank oil.</P>
<P>I have been informed al&s;o, from undoubted authority, that &s;ome ladies (ladies you will &s;ay of peculiar ta&s;te) took a fancy to a toad, which they nouri&s;hed &s;ummer after &s;ummer, for many years, till he grew to a mon&s;trous &s;ize, with the maggots which turn to fle&s;h flies. The reptile u&s;ed to come forth every evening from an hole under the garden-&s;teps; and was taken up, after &s;upper, on the
<PB N="49" REF="56">
table to be fed. But at la&s;t a tame raven, kenning him as he put forth his head, gave him &s;uch a &s;evere &s;troke with his horny beak as put out one eye. After this accident the creature langui&s;hed for &s;ome time and died.</P>
<P>I need not remind a gentleman of your exten&s;ive reading of the excellent account there is from Mr. <HI>Derham,</HI> in <HI>Ray</HI>'s Wi&s;dom of God in the Creation (p. 365), concerning the migration of frogs from their breeding ponds. In this account he at once &s;ubverts that fooli&s;h opinion of their dropping from the clouds in rain; &s;hewing that it is from the grateful coolne&s;s and moi&s;ture of tho&s;e &s;howers that they are tempted to &s;et out on their travels, which they defer till tho&s;e fall. Frogs are as yet in their tadpole &s;tate; but, in a few weeks, our lanes, paths, fields, will &s;warm for a few days with myriads of tho&s;e emigrants, no larger than my little finger nail. <HI>Swammerdam</HI> gives a mo&s;t accurate account of the method and &s;ituation in which the male impregnates the &s;pawn of the female. How wonderful is the oeconomy of Provi|dence with regard to the limbs of &s;o vile a reptile! While it is an <HI>aquatic</HI> it has a fi&s;h-like tail, and no legs: as &s;oon as the legs &s;prout, the tail drops off as u&s;ele&s;s, and the animal betakes it&s;elf to the land!</P>
<P><HI>Merret,</HI> I tru&s;t, is widely mi&s;taken when he advances that the <HI>rana arborea</HI> is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reptile; it abounds in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be remembered that the <HI>&s;alamandra aquatica</HI> of <HI>Ray</HI> (the water-newt or eft) will frequently bite at the angler's bait, and is often caught on his hook. I u&s;ed to take it for granted that the <HI>&s;alamandra aquatica</HI> was hatched, lived, and died, in the water. But <HI>John Ellis,</HI> E&s;q. F.R.S. (the coralline <HI>Ellis</HI>) a&s;&s;erts, in a letter to the Royal Society, dated <HI>June</HI> the 5th, 1766, in his ac|count
<PB N="50" REF="57">
of the <HI>mud inguana,</HI> an amphibious <HI>bipes</HI> from <HI>South Carolina,</HI> that the water-eft, or newt, is only the <HI>larva</HI> of the land-eft, as tadpoles are of frogs. Le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected to mi&s;under|&s;tand his meaning, I &s;hall give it in his own words. Speaking of the <HI>opercula</HI> or coverings to the gills of the <HI>mud inguana,</HI> he pro|ceeds to &s;ay that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The form of the&s;e pennated coverings approach very near to what I have &s;ome time ago ob&s;erved in the <HI>larva</HI> or <HI>aquatic</HI> &s;tate of our <HI>Engli&s;h lacerta,</HI> known by the name of eft, or newt; which &s;erve them for coverings to their gills, and for fins to &s;wim with while in this &s;tate; and which they lo&s;e, as well as the fins of their tails, when they <HI>change</HI> their &s;tate and <HI>become land animals,</HI> as I have ob&s;erved, by keeping them alive for &s;ome time my&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Linnaeus,</HI> in his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> hints at what Mr. <HI>Ellis</HI> advances more than once.</P>
<P>Providence has been &s;o indulgent to us as to allow of but one venomous reptile of the &s;erpent kind in the&s;e kingdoms, and that is the viper. As you propo&s;e the good of mankind to be an object of your publications, you will not omit to mention common &s;allad|oil as a &s;overeign remedy again&s;t the bite of the viper. As to the blind worm (<HI>anguis fragilis,</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e it &s;naps in &s;under with a &s;mall blow), I have found, on examination, that it is per|fectly innocuous. A neighbouring yeoman (to whom I am indebted for &s;ome good hints) killed and opened a female viper about the twenty-&s;eventh of <HI>May:</HI> he found her filled with a chain of eleven eggs, about the &s;ize of tho&s;e of a blackbird; but none of them were advanced &s;o far towards a &s;tate of maturity as to contain any rudiments of young. Though they are oviparous, yet they are viviparous al&s;o, hatching their young within their bellies, and then bringing them forth. Whereas &s;nakes lay
<PB N="51" REF="58">
chains of eggs every &s;ummer in my melon beds, in &s;pite of all that my people can do to prevent them; which eggs do not hatch till the &s;pring following, as I have often experienced. Several intelligent folks a&s;&s;ure me that they have &s;een the viper open her mouth and admit her helple&s;s young down her throat on &s;udden &s;urpri&s;es, ju&s;t as the female opo&s;&s;um does her brood into the pouch under her belly, upon the like emergencies; and yet the <HI>London</HI> viper-catchers in&s;i&s;t on it, to Mr. <HI>Barrington,</HI> that no &s;uch thing ever happens. The &s;erpent kind eat, I believe, but once in a year; or, rather, but only ju&s;t at one &s;ea&s;on of the year. Country people talk much of a water-&s;nake, but, I am pretty &s;ure, without any rea&s;on; for the common &s;nake (<HI>coluber natrix</HI>) delights much to &s;port in the water, perhaps with a view to procure frogs and other food.</P>
<P>I cannot well gue&s;s how you are to make out your twelve &s;pecies of reptiles, unle&s;s it be by the various &s;pecies, or rather varieties, of our <HI>lacerti,</HI> of which <HI>Ray</HI> enumerates five. I have not had op|portunity of a&s;certaining the&s;e; but remember well to have &s;een, formerly, &s;everal beautiful green <HI>lacerti</HI> on the &s;unny &s;andbanks near <HI>Farnham,</HI> in <HI>Surrey;</HI> and <HI>Ray</HI> admits there are &s;uch in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>

<P>I RECEIVED your obliging and communicative letter of <HI>June</HI> the 28th, while I was on a vi&s;it at a gentleman's hou&s;e, where I had neither books to turn to, nor lei&s;ure to &s;it down, to return you an an&s;wer to many queries, which I wanted to re&s;olve in the be&s;t manner that I am able.</P>
<P>A per&s;on, by my order, has &s;earched our brooks, but could find no &s;uch fi&s;h as the <HI>ga&s;tero&s;teus pungitius:</HI> he found the <HI>ga&s;tero&s;teus aculeatus</HI> in plenty. This morning, in a ba&s;ket, I packed a little earthen pot full of wet mo&s;s, and in it &s;ome &s;tickle|backs, male and female; the females big with &s;pawn: &s;ome lamperns; &s;ome bulls heads; but I could procure no minnows. This ba&s;ket will be in <HI>Fleet-&s;treet</HI> by eight this evening; &s;o I hope <HI>Mazel</HI> will have them fre&s;h and fair to-morrow morning. I gave &s;ome directions, in a letter, to what particulars the engraver &s;hould be attentive.</P>
<P>Finding, while I was on a vi&s;it, that I was within a rea&s;onable di&s;tance of <HI>Ambre&s;bury,</HI> I &s;ent a &s;ervant over to that town, and procured &s;everal living &s;pecimens of loaches, which he brought, &s;afe and bri&s;k, in a gla&s;s decanter. They were taken in the gul|lies that were cut for watering the meadows. From the&s;e fi&s;hes (which mea&s;ured from two to four inches in length) I took the following de&s;cription: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The loach, in it's general a&s;pect, has a pellucid appearance: it's back is mottled with irregular collections of &s;mall black dots, not reaching much below the
<PB N="53" REF="60">
<HI>linea lateralis,</HI> as are the back and tail fins: a black line runs from each eye down to the no&s;e; it's belly is of a &s;ilvery white; the upper jaw projects beyond the lower, and is &s;ur|rounded with &s;ix feelers, three on each &s;ide: it's pectoral fins are large, it's ventral much &s;maller; the fin behind it's anus &s;mall; it's dor&s;al-fin large, containing eight &s;pines; it's tail, where it joins to the tail-fin, <HI>remarkably broad,</HI> without any taperne&s;s, &s;o as to be characteri&s;tic of this genus: the tail-fin is broad, and &s;quare at the end. From the breadth and mu&s;|cular &s;trength of the tail it appears to be an active nimble fi&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>In my vi&s;it I was not very far from <HI>Hungerford,</HI> and did not forget to make &s;ome inquiries concerning the wonderful method of curing cancers by means of toads. Several intelligent per|&s;ons, both gentry and clergy, do, I find, give a great deal of credit to what was a&s;&s;erted in the papers: and I my&s;elf dined with a clergyman who &s;eemed to be per&s;uaded that what is related is matter of fact; but, when I came to attend to his account, I thought I di&s;cerned circum&s;tances which did not a little invalidate the woman's &s;tory of the manner in which &s;he came by her &s;kill. She &s;ays of her&s;elf <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, labouring under a virulent cancer, &s;he went to &s;ome church where there was a va&s;t crowd: on going into a pew, &s;hew was acco&s;ted by a &s;trange clergyman; who, after expre&s;&s;ing compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ituation, told her that if &s;he would make &s;uch an application of living toads as is mentioned &s;he would be well."</Q> Now is it likely that this unknown gen|tleman &s;hould expre&s;s &s;o much tenderne&s;s for this &s;ingle &s;ufferer, and not feel any for the many thou&s;ands that daily langui&s;h under this terrible di&s;order? Would he not have made u&s;e of this invaluable no&s;trum for his own emolument; or, at lea&s;t, by
<PB N="54" REF="61">
&s;ome means of publication or other, have found a method of mak|ing it public for the good of mankind? In &s;hort, this woman (as it appears to me) having &s;et up for a cancer-doctre&s;s, finds it ex|pedient to amu&s;e the country with this dark and my&s;terious relation.</P>
<P>The water-eft has not, that I can di&s;cern, the lea&s;t appearance of any gills; for want of which it is continually ri&s;ing to the &s;ur|face of the water to take in fre&s;h air. I opened a big-bellied one indeed, and found it full of &s;pawn. Not that this circum&s;tance at all invalidates the a&s;&s;ertion that they are <HI>larvae:</HI> for the <HI>larvae</HI> of in&s;ects are full of eggs, which they exclude the in&s;tant they enter their la&s;t &s;tate. The water-eft is continually climbing over the brims of the ve&s;&s;el, within which we keep it in water, and wander|ing away: and people every &s;ummer &s;ee numbers crawling, out of the pools where they are hatched, up the dry banks. There are varieties of them, differing in colour; and &s;ome have fins up their tail and back, and &s;ome have not.</P>

<P>I HAVE now, pa&s;t di&s;pute, made out three di&s;tinct &s;pecies of the willow-wrens <HI>(motacillae trochili)</HI> which <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> and <HI>invariably</HI> u&s;e di&s;tinct notes. But, at the &s;ame time, I am obliged to confe&s;s that I know nothing of your willow-lark<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><HI>Brit. Zool.</HI> edit, 1776, octavo, p. 381.</NOTE>. In my letter
<PB N="55" REF="62">
of <HI>April</HI> the 18th, I had told you peremptorily that I knew your willow-lark, but had not &s;een it then: but, when I came to pro|cure it, it proved, in all re&s;pects, a very <HI>motacilla trochilus;</HI> only that it is a &s;ize larger than the two other, and the yellow-green of the whole upper part of the body is more vivid, and the belly of a clearer white. I have &s;pecimens of the three &s;orts now lying before me; and can di&s;cern that there are three gradations of &s;izes, and that the lea&s;t has black legs, and the other two fle&s;h-coloured ones. The yellowe&s;t bird is con&s;iderably the large&s;t, and has it's quill-feathers and &s;econdary feathers tipped with white, which the others have not. This la&s;t haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods, and makes a &s;ibilous gra&s;shopper-like noi&s;e, now and then, at &s;hort intervals, &s;hivering a little with it's wings when it &s;ings; and is, I make no doubt now, the <HI>regulus non cri&s;tatus</HI> of <HI>Ray;</HI> which he &s;ays <Q REND="inline">"<HI>cantat voce &s;tridul&acirc; locu&s;tae.</HI>"</Q> Yet this great ornithologi&s;t never &s;u&s;pected that there were three &s;pecies.</P>

<P>IT is, I find, in <HI>zoology</HI> as it is in <HI>botany:</HI> all nature is &s;o full, that that di&s;trict produces the greate&s;t variety which is the mo&s;t examined. Several birds, which are &s;aid to belong to the north only, are, it &s;eems, often in the &s;outh. I have di&s;covered this
<PB N="56" REF="63">
&s;ummer three &s;pecies of birds with us, which writers mention as only to be &s;een in the northern counties. The fir&s;t that was brought me (on the 14th of <HI>May</HI>), was the &s;andpiper, <HI>tringa hypoleucus:</HI> it was a cock bird, and haunted the banks of &s;ome ponds near the village; and, as it had a companion, doubtle&s;s intended to have bred near that water. Be&s;ides, the owner has told me &s;ince, that, on recollection, he has &s;een &s;ome of the &s;ame birds round his ponds in former &s;ummers.</P>
<P>The next bird that I procured (on the 21&s;t of <HI>May</HI>) was a male red-backed butcher bird, <HI>lanius collurio.</HI> My neighbour, who &s;hot it, &s;ays that it might ea&s;ily have e&s;caped his notice, had not the outcries and chattering of the white-throats and other &s;mall birds drawn his attention to the bu&s;h where it was: it's craw was filled with the legs and wings of beetles.</P>
<P>The next rare birds (which were procured for me la&s;t week) were &s;ome ring-ou&s;els, <HI>turdi torquati.</HI></P>
<P>This week twelve months a gentleman from <HI>London,</HI> being with us, was amu&s;ing him&s;elf with a gun, and found, he told us, on an old yew hedge where there were berries, &s;ome birds like black|birds, with rings of white round their necks: a neighbouring farmer al&s;o at the &s;ame time ob&s;erved the &s;ame; but, as no &s;peci|mens were procured, little notice was taken. I mentioned this circum&s;tance to you in my letter of <HI>November</HI> the 4th, 1767: (you however paid but &s;mall regard to what I &s;aid, as I had not &s;een the&s;e birds my&s;elf): but la&s;t week the afore&s;aid farmer, &s;eeing a large flock, twenty or thirty of the&s;e birds, &s;hot two cocks and two hens: and &s;ays, on recollection, that he remembers to have ob&s;erved the&s;e birds again la&s;t &s;pring, about <HI>Lady-day,</HI> as it were, on their return to the north. Now perhaps the&s;e ou&s;els are not the ou&s;els of the north of <HI>England,</HI> but belong to the more northern parts of
<PB N="57" REF="64">
<HI>Europe;</HI> and may retire before the exce&s;&s;ive rigor of the fro&s;ts in tho&s;e parts; and return to breed in the &s;pring, when the cold abates. If this be the ca&s;e, here is di&s;covered a new bird of winter pa&s;&s;age, concerning who&s;e migrations the writers are &s;ilent: but if the&s;e birds &s;hould prove the ou&s;els of the north of <HI>England,</HI> then here is a migration di&s;clo&s;ed within our own kingdom never be|fore remarked. It does not yet appear whether they retire beyond the bounds of our i&s;land to the &s;outh; but it is mo&s;t probable that they u&s;ually do, or el&s;e one cannot &s;uppo&s;e that they would have continued &s;o long unnoticed in the &s;outhern counties. The ou&s;el is larger than a blackbird, and feeds on haws; but la&s;t autumn (when there were no haws) it fed on yew-berries: in the &s;pring it feeds on ivy-berries, which ripen only at that &s;ea&s;on, in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to tell you (as you have been &s;o lately on the &s;tudy of reptiles) that my people, every now and then of late, draw up with a bucket of water from my well, which is 63 feet deep, a large black warty lizard with a fin-tail and yellow belly. How they fir&s;t came down at that depth, and how they were ever to have got out thence without help, is more than I am able to &s;ay.</P>
<P>My thanks are due to you for your trouble and care in the ex|amination of a buck's head. As far as your di&s;coveries reach at pre&s;ent, they &s;eem much to corroborate my &s;u&s;picions; and I hope Mr. &mdash; may find rea&s;on to give his deci&s;ion in my favour; and then, I think, we may advance this extraordinary provi&s;ion of nature as a new in&s;tance of the wi&s;dom of God in the creation.</P>
<P>As yet I have not quite done with my hi&s;tory of the <HI>oedicnemus,</HI> or &s;tone-curlew; for I &s;hall de&s;ire a gentleman in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> (near who&s;e hou&s;e the&s;e birds congregate in va&s;t flocks in the autumn)
<PB N="58" REF="65">
to ob&s;erve nicely when they leave him, (if they do leave him) and when they return again in the &s;pring: I was with this gentle|man lately, and &s;aw &s;everal &s;ingle birds.</P>

<P>WITH regard to the <HI>oedicnemus,</HI> or &s;tone-curlew, I intend to write very &s;oon to my friend near <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> in who&s;e neighbour|hood the&s;e birds &s;eem mo&s;t to abound; and &s;hall urge him to take particular notice when they begin to congregate, and afterwards to watch them mo&s;t narrowly whether they do not withdraw them|&s;elves during the dead of the winter. When I have obtained infor|mation with re&s;pect to this circum&s;tance, I &s;hall have fini&s;hed my hi&s;tory of the <HI>&s;tone-curlew;</HI> which I hope will prove to your &s;ati&s;|faction, as it will be, I tru&s;t, very near the truth. This gentle|man, as he occupies a large farm of his own, and is abroad early and late, will be a very proper &s;py upon the motions of the&s;e birds: and be&s;ides, as I have prevailed on him to buy the Naturali&s;t's Journal (with which he is much delighted), I &s;hall expect that he will be very exact in his dates. It is very extraordinary, as you ob&s;erve, that a bird &s;o common with us &s;hould never &s;traggle to you.</P>
<P>And here will be the propere&s;t place to mention, while I think of it, an anecdote which the above-mentioned gentleman told me
<PB N="59" REF="66">
when I was la&s;t at his hou&s;e; which was that, in a warren joining to his outlet, many daws <HI>(corvi monedulae)</HI> build every year in the rabbit-burrows under ground. The way he and his brothers u&s;ed to take their ne&s;ts, while they were boys, was by li&s;tening at the mouths of the holes; and, if they heard the young ones cry, they twi&s;ted the ne&s;t out with a forked &s;tick. Some water-fowls (<HI>viz.</HI> the puffins) breed, I know, in that manner; but I &s;hould never have &s;u&s;pected the daws of building in holes on the flat ground.</P>
<P>Another very unlikely &s;pot is made u&s;e of by daws as a place to breed in, and that is <HI>Stonehenge.</HI> The&s;e birds depo&s;it their ne&s;ts in the inter&s;tices between the upright and the impo&s;t &s;tones of that amazing work of antiquity: which circum&s;tance alone &s;peaks the prodigious height of the upright &s;tones, that they &s;hould be tall enough to &s;ecure tho&s;e ne&s;ts from the annoyance of &s;hepherd-boys, who are always idling round that place.</P>
<P>One of my neighbours la&s;t <HI>Saturday, November</HI> the 26th, &s;aw a martin in a &s;heltered bottom: the &s;un &s;hone warm, and the bird was hawking bri&s;kly after flies. I am now perfectly &s;atisfied that they do not all leave this i&s;land in the winter.</P>
<P>You judge very right, I think, in &s;peaking with re&s;erve and caution concerning the cures done by toads: for, let people ad|vance what they will on &s;uch &s;ubjects, yet there is &s;uch a propen|&s;ity in mankind towards deceiving and being deceived, that one cannot &s;afely relate any thing from common report, e&s;pecially in print, without expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome degree of doubt and &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Your approbation, with regard to my new di&s;covery of the migration of the ring-ou&s;el, gives me &s;atisfaction; and I find you concur with me in &s;u&s;pecting that they are foreign birds which vi&s;it us. You will be &s;ure, I hope, not to omit to make inquiry whether your ring-ou&s;els leave your rocks in the autumn. What
<PB N="60" REF="67">
puzzles me mo&s;t, is the very &s;hort &s;tay they make with us; for in about three weeks they are all gone. I &s;hall be very curious to remark whether they will call on us at their return in the &s;pring, as they did la&s;t year.</P>
<P>I want to be better informed with regard to icthyology. If fortune had &s;ettled me near the &s;ea-&s;ide, or near &s;ome great river, my natural propen&s;ity would &s;oon have urged me to have made my&s;elf acquainted with their productions: but as I have lived mo&s;tly in inland parts, and in an upland di&s;trict, my knowledge of fi&s;hes extends little farther than to tho&s;e common &s;orts which our brooks and lakes produce.</P>

<P>AS to the peculiarity of jackdaws building with us under the ground in rabbit-burrows, you have, in part, hit upon the rea|&s;on; for, in reality, there are hardly any towers or &s;teeples in all this country. And perhaps, <HI>Norfolk</HI> excepted, <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> are as meanly furni&s;hed with churches as almo&s;t any counties in the kingdom. We have many livings of two or three hundred pounds a year, who&s;e hou&s;es of wor&s;hip make little better appear|ance than dovecots. When I fir&s;t &s;aw <HI>Northampton&s;hire, Cambridge&s;hire</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="68">
and <HI>Huntingdon&s;hire,</HI> and the fens of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> I was amazed at the number of &s;pires which pre&s;ented them&s;elves in every point of view. As an admirer of pro&s;pects, I have rea&s;on to lament this want in my own country; for &s;uch objects are very nece&s;&s;ary ingredients in an elegant land&s;cape.</P>
<P>What you mention with re&s;pect to reclaimed toads rai&s;es my curio&s;ity. An ancient author, though no naturali&s;t, has well re|marked that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Every kind of bea&s;ts, and of birds, and of &s;erpents, and things in the &s;ea, is tamed, and hath been tamed, of mankind</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><HI>James,</HI> chap. iii. 7.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>It is a &s;atisfaction to me to find that a green lizard has actually been procured for you in <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> becau&s;e it corroborates my di&s;covery, which I made many years ago, of the &s;ame &s;ort, on a &s;unny &s;andbank near <HI>Farnham,</HI> in <HI>Surrey.</HI> I am well acquainted with the &s;outh hams of <HI>Devon&s;hire;</HI> and can &s;uppo&s;e that di&s;trict, from it's &s;outherly &s;ituation, to be a proper habitation for &s;uch animals in their be&s;t colours.</P>
<P>Since the ring-ou&s;els of your va&s;t mountains do certainly not for&s;ake them again&s;t winter, our &s;u&s;picions that tho&s;e which vi&s;it this neighbourhood about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> are not <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> birds, but driven from the more northern parts of <HI>Europe</HI> by the fro&s;ts, are &s;till more rea&s;onable; and it will be worth your pains to endeavour to trace from whence they come, and to inquire why they make &s;o very &s;hort a &s;tay.</P>
<P>In your account of your error with regard to the two &s;pecies of herons, you incidentally gave me great entertainment in your de|&s;cription of the heronry at <HI>Cre&s;&s;i-hall;</HI> which is a curio&s;ity I never could manage to &s;ee. Four&s;core ne&s;ts of &s;uch a bird on one tree is a rarity which I would ride half as many miles to have a
<PB N="62" REF="69">
&s;ight of. Pray be &s;ure to tell me in your next who&s;e &s;eat <HI>Cre&s;&s;i-hall</HI> is, and near what town it lies<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cre&s;&s;i-hall</HI> is near <HI>Spalding,</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI></NOTE>. I have often thought that tho&s;e va&s;t extents of fens have never been &s;ufficiently explored. If half a dozen gentlemen, furni&s;hed with a good &s;trength of water-&s;paniels, were to beat them over for a week, they would certainly find more &s;pecies.</P>
<P>There is no bird, I believe, who&s;e manners I have &s;tudied more than that of the <HI>caprimulgus</HI> (the goat-&s;ucker), as it is a won|derful and curious creature: but I have always found that though &s;ometimes it may chatter as it flies, as I know it does, yet in general it utters it's jarring note &s;itting on a bough; and I have for many an half hour watched it as it &s;at with it's under mandible quivering, and particularly this &s;ummer. It perches u&s;ually on a bare twig, with it's head lower than it's tail, in an attitude well expre&s;&s;ed by your draught&s;man in the folio <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology.</HI> This bird is mo&s;t punctual in beginning it's &s;ong exactly at the clo&s;e of day; &s;o exactly that I have known it &s;trike up more than once or twice ju&s;t at the report of the <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> evening gun, which we can hear when the weather is &s;till. It appears to me pa&s;t all doubt that it's notes are formed by organic impul&s;e, by the powers of the parts of it's windpipe, formed for &s;ound, ju&s;t as cats put. You will credit me, I hope, when I a&s;&s;ure you that, as my neighbours were a&s;&s;embled in an <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the vignette in this book.</NOTE> hermitage on the &s;ide of a &s;teep hill where we drink tea, one of the&s;e churn-owls came and &s;ettled on the cro&s;s of that little &s;traw edifice and began to chatter, and continued his note for many minutes: and we were all &s;truck with wonder to find that the organs of that little animal, when put in motion, gave a &s;en&s;ible vibration to the whole building! This
<PB N="63" REF="70">
bird al&s;o &s;ometimes makes a &s;mall &s;queak, repeated four or five times; and I have ob&s;erved that to happen when the cock has been pur&s;uing the hen in a toying way through the boughs of a tree.</P>
<P>It would not be at all &s;trange if your bat, which you have procured, &s;hould prove a new one, &s;ince five &s;pecies have been found in a neighbouring kingdom. The great &s;ort that I men|tioned is certainly a non-de&s;cript: I &s;aw but one this &s;ummer, and that I had no opportunity of taking.</P>
<P>Your account of the <HI>Indian-gra&s;s</HI> was entertaining. I am no angler my&s;elf; but inquiring of tho&s;e that are, what they &s;uppo&s;ed that part of their tackle to be made of? they replied <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of the in|te&s;tines of a &s;ilkworm."</Q></P>
<P>Though I mu&s;t not pretend to great &s;kill in entomology, yet I cannot &s;ay that I am ignorant of that kind of knowledge: I may now and then perhaps be able to furni&s;h you with a little information.</P>
<P>The va&s;t rains cea&s;ed with us much about the &s;ame time as with you, and &s;ince we have had delicate weather. Mr. <HI>Barker,</HI> who has mea&s;ured the rain for more than thirty years, &s;ays, in a late letter, that more has fallen this year than in any he ever attended to; though, from <HI>July</HI> 1763 to <HI>January</HI> 1764, more fell than in any &s;even months of this year.</P>

<P>IT is not improbable that the <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> lizard and our green lizards may be &s;pecifically the &s;ame; all that I know is, that, when &s;ome years ago many <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> lizards were turned loo&s;e in <HI>Pembroke</HI> college garden, in the univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> they lived a great while, and &s;eemed to enjoy them&s;elves very well, but never bred. Whether this circum&s;tance will prove any thing either way I &s;hall not pretend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>I return you thanks for your account of <HI>Cre&s;&s;i-hall;</HI> but recollect, not without regret, that in <HI>June</HI> 1746 I was vi&s;iting for a week to|gether at <HI>Spalding,</HI> without ever being told that &s;uch a curio&s;ity was ju&s;t at hand. Pray &s;end me word in your next what &s;ort of tree it is that contains &s;uch a quantity of herons' ne&s;ts; and whether the heronry con&s;i&s;ts of a whole grove or wood, or only of a few trees.</P>
<P>It gave me &s;atisfaction to find we accorded &s;o well about the <HI>caprimulgus:</HI> all I contended for was to prove that it often chatters &s;itting as well as flying; and therefore the noi&s;e was voluntary, and from organic impul&s;e, and not from the re&s;i&s;tance of the air again&s;t the hollow of it's mouth and throat.</P>
<P>If ever I &s;aw any thing like actual migration, it was la&s;t <HI>Michaelmas-day.</HI> I was travelling, and out early in the morning: at fir&s;t there was a va&s;t fog; but, by the time that I was got &s;even or eight miles from home towards the coa&s;t, the &s;un broke out into a

We were then on a large heath or common, and I could di&s;cern, as the mi&s;t began to break away, great numbers of &s;wallows (<HI>hirundines ru&s;ticae</HI>) clu&s;tering on the &s;tunted &s;hrubs and bu&s;hes, as if they had roo&s;ted there all night. As &s;oon as the air became clear and plea&s;ant they all were on the wing at once; and, by a placid and ea&s;y flight, proceeded on &s;outhward to|wards the &s;ea: after this I did not &s;ee any more flocks, only now and then a &s;traggler.</P>
<P>I cannot agree with tho&s;e per&s;ons that a&s;&s;ert that the &s;wallow kind di&s;appear &s;ome and &s;ome gradually, as they come, for the bulk of them &s;eem to withdraw at once: only &s;ome &s;tragglers &s;tay behind a long while, and do never, there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, leave this i&s;land. Swallows &s;eem to lay them&s;elves up, and to come forth in a warm day, as bats do continually of a warm evening, after they have di&s;appeared for weeks. For a very re&s;pec|table gentleman a&s;&s;ured me that, as he was walking with &s;ome friends under <HI>Merton-wall</HI> on a remarkably hot noon, either in the la&s;t week in <HI>December</HI> or the fir&s;t week in <HI>January,</HI> he e&s;pied three or four &s;wallows huddled together on the moulding of one of the windows of that college. I have frequently remarked that &s;wallows are &s;een later at <HI>Oxford</HI> than el&s;ewhere: is it owing to the va&s;t ma&s;&s;y build|ings of that place, to the many waters round it, or to what el&s;e?</P>
<P>When I u&s;ed to ri&s;e in a morning la&s;t autumn, and &s;ee the &s;wallows and martins clu&s;tering on the chimnies and thatch of the neighbouring cottages, I could not help being touched with a &s;ecret delight, mixed with &s;ome degree of mortification: with delight, to ob&s;erve with how much ardour and punctuality tho&s;e poor little birds obeyed the &s;trong impul&s;e towards migration, or hiding, imprinted on their minds by their great Creator; and with &s;ome degree of mortification, when I reflected that, after all our
<PB N="66" REF="73">
pains and inquiries, we are yet not quite certain to what regions they do migrate; and are &s;till farther embara&s;&s;ed to find that &s;ome do not actually migrate at all.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion on my imagina|tion, that they became productive of a compo&s;ition that may per|haps amu&s;e you for a quarter of an hour when next I have the honour of writing to you.</P>

<P>THE <HI>&s;carabaeus fullo</HI> I know very well, having &s;een it in collec|tions; but have never been able to di&s;cover one wild in it's natural &s;tate. Mr. <HI>Banks</HI> told me he thought it might be found on the &s;eacoa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of <HI>April</HI> I went to the &s;heep-down, where the <HI>ring-ou&s;els</HI> have been ob&s;erved to make their appearance at &s;pring and fall, in their way perhaps to the north or &s;outh; and was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee three birds about the u&s;ual &s;pot. We &s;hot a cock and a hen; they were plump and in high condition. The hen had but very &s;mall rudiments of eggs within her, which proves they are late breeders; whereas tho&s;e &s;pecies of the thru&s;h kind that remain with us the whole year have fledged young before that time. In their crops was nothing very di&s;tingui&s;hable, but &s;ome|what that &s;eemed like blades of vegetables nearly dige&s;ted. In
<PB N="67" REF="74">
autumn they feed on haws and yew-berries, and in the &s;pring on ivy-berries. I dre&s;&s;ed one of the&s;e birds, and found it juicy and well flavoured. It is remarkable that they make but a few days &s;tay in their &s;pring vi&s;it, but re&s;t near a fortnight at <HI>Michaelmas.</HI> The&s;e birds, from the ob&s;ervations of three &s;prings and two autumns, are mo&s;t punctual in their return; and exhibit a new migration unnoticed by the writers, who &s;uppo&s;ed they never were to be &s;een in any of the &s;outhern counties.</P>
<P>One of my neighbours lately brought me a new <HI>&s;alicaria,</HI> which at fir&s;t I &s;u&s;pected might have proved your willow-lark<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">For this <HI>&s;alicaria</HI> &s;ee letter <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30, 1769.</NOTE>, but, on a nicer examination, it an&s;wered much better to the de|&s;cription of that &s;pecies which you &s;hot at <HI>Reve&s;by,</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire.</HI> My bird I de&s;cribe thus: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is a &s;ize le&s;s than the gra&s;shopper-lark; the head, back, and coverts of the wings, of a du&s;ky brown, without tho&s;e dark &s;pots of the gra&s;shopper-lark; over each eye is a milkwhite &s;troke; the chin and throat are white, and the under parts of a yellowi&s;h white; the rump is tawny, and the feathers of the tail &s;harp-pointed; the bill is du&s;ky and &s;harp, and the legs are du&s;ky; the hinder claw long and crooked."</Q> The per&s;on that &s;hot it &s;ays that it &s;ung &s;o like a reed-&s;parrow that he took it for one; and that it &s;ings all night: but this account merits farther inquiry. For my part, I &s;u&s;pect it is a &s;econd &s;ort of <HI>locu&s;tella,</HI> hinted at by Dr. <HI>Derham</HI> in <HI>Ray's Letters:</HI> &s;ee p. 108. He al&s;o procured me a gra&s;shopper-lark.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion that you put with regard to tho&s;e genera of animals that are peculiar to <HI>America,</HI> viz. how they came there, and whence? is too puzzling for me to an&s;wer; and yet &s;o obvious as often to have &s;truck me with wonder. If one looks into the writers
<PB N="68" REF="75">
on that &s;ubject little &s;atisfaction is to be found. Ingenious men will readily advance plau&s;ible arguments to &s;upport whatever theory they &s;hall chu&s;e to maintain; but then the misfortune is, every one's hypothe&s;is is each as good as another's, &s;ince they are all founded on conjecture. The late writers of this &s;ort, in whom may be &s;een all the arguments of tho&s;e that have gone before, as I remember, &s;tock <HI>America</HI> from the we&s;tern coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> and the &s;outh of <HI>Europe;</HI> and then break down the I&s;thmus that bridged over the <HI>Atlantic.</HI> But this is making u&s;e of a violent piece of machinery: it is a difficulty worthy of the interpo&s;ition of a god! <Q REND="inline">"<HI>Incredulus odi.</HI>"</Q></P>

<P>IT gives me &s;atisfaction to find that my account of the <HI>ou&s;el migration</HI> plea&s;es you. You put a very &s;hrewd que&s;tion when you a&s;k me how I know that their autumnal migration is &s;outhward?
<PB N="71" REF="78">
Was not candour and openne&s;s the very life of natural hi&s;tory, I &s;hould pa&s;s over this query ju&s;t as a &s;ly commentator does over a crabbed pa&s;&s;age in a cla&s;&s;ic; but common ingenuou&s;ne&s;s obliges me to confe&s;s, not without &s;ome degree of &s;hame, that I only rea|&s;oned in that ca&s;e from analogy. For as all other autumnal birds migrate from the northward to us, to partake of our milder winters, and return to the northward again when the rigorous cold abates, &s;o I concluded that the ring-ou&s;els did the &s;ame, as well as their congeners the fieldfares; and e&s;pecially as ring-ou&s;els are known to haunt cold mountainous countries: but I have good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;ince that they may come to us from the we&s;tward; be|cau&s;e I hear, from very good authority, that they breed on <HI>Dartmore;</HI> and that they for&s;ake that wild di&s;trict about the time that our vi&s;itors appear, and do not return till late in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>I have taken a great deal of pains about your <HI>&s;alicaria</HI> and mine, with a white &s;troke over it's eye and a tawny rump. I have &s;ur|veyed it alive and dead, and have procured &s;everal &s;pecimens; and am perfectly per&s;uaded my&s;elf (and tru&s;t you will &s;oon be convinced of the &s;ame) that it is no more nor le&s;s than the <HI>pa&s;&s;er arundinaceus minor</HI> of <HI>Ray.</HI> This bird, by &s;ome means or other, &s;eems to be entirely omitted in the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology;</HI> and one rea&s;on probably was becau&s;e it is &s;o &s;trangely cla&s;&s;ed in <HI>Ray,</HI> who ranges it among his <HI>picis affines.</HI> It ought no doubt to have gone among his <HI>aviculae caud&acirc; unicolore,</HI> and among your &s;lender-billed &s;mall birds of the &s;ame divi&s;ion. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> might with great propriety have put it into his genus of <HI>motacilla;</HI> and the <HI>motacilla &s;alicaria</HI> of his <HI>fauna &s;uecica</HI> &s;eems to come the neare&s;t to it. It is no uncom|mon bird, haunting the &s;ides of ponds and rivers where there is covert, and the reeds and &s;edges of moors.

day during the breeding-time, imitating the note of a &s;parrow, a &s;wallow, a &s;ky-lark; and has a &s;trange hurrying manner in it's &s;ong.

<P>I have got you the egg of an <HI>oedicnemus,</HI> or &s;tone-curlew, which was picked up in a fallow on the naked ground: there were two; but the finder inadvertently cru&s;hed one with his foot before he &s;aw them.</P>
<P>When I wrote to you la&s;t year on reptiles, I wi&s;h I had not forgot to mention the faculty that &s;nakes have of &s;tinking <HI>&s;e defendendo.</HI> I knew a gentleman who kept a tame &s;nake, which was in it's per&s;on as &s;weet as any animal while in good humour and unalarmed; but as &s;oon as a &s;tranger, or a dog or cat, came in, it fell to hi&s;&s;ing, and filled the room with &s;uch nau&s;eous effluvia as rendered it hardly &s;upportable.

<OPENER><DATELINE>SELBORNE, <DATE>December 8, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS much gratified by your communicative letter on your return from <HI>Scotland,</HI> where you &s;pent, I find, &s;ome con&s;iderable time, and gave your&s;elf good room to examine the natural curio&s;ities of that exten&s;ive kingdom, both tho&s;e of the i&s;lands, as well as tho&s;e of the highlands. The u&s;ual bane of &s;uch expeditions is hurry; becau&s;e men &s;eldom allot them&s;elves half the time they &s;hould do: but, fixing on a day for their return, po&s;t from place to place, rather as if they were on a journey that required di&s;patch, than as philo&s;ophers inve&s;tigating the works of nature. You mu&s;t have made, no doubt, many di&s;coveries, and laid up a good fund of materials for a future edition of the <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology;</HI> and will have no rea&s;on to repent that you have be&s;towed &s;o much pains on a part of <HI>Great-Britian</HI> that perhaps was never &s;o well examined before.</P>
<P>It has always been matter of wonder to me that fieldfares, which are &s;o congenerous to thru&s;hes and blackbirds, &s;hould never chu&s;e to breed in <HI>England:</HI> but that they &s;hould not think even the highlands cold and northerly, and &s;eque&s;tered enough, is a circum&s;tance &s;till more &s;trange and wonderful. The ring|ou&s;el, you find, &s;tays in <HI>Scotland</HI> the whole year round; &s;o that we have rea&s;on to conclude that tho&s;e migrators that vi&s;it us for a &s;hort &s;pace every autumn do not come from thence.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="81">
And here, I think, will be the proper place to mention that tho&s;e birds were mo&s;t punctual again in their migration this autumn, appearing, as before, about the 30th of <HI>September:</HI> but their flocks were larger than common, and their &s;tay protracted &s;ome|what beyond the u&s;ual time. If they came to &s;pend the whole winter with us, as &s;ome of their congeners do, and then left us, as they do, in &s;pring, I &s;hould not be &s;o much &s;truck with the occurrence, &s;ince it would be &s;imilar to that of the other winter birds of pa&s;&s;age; but when I &s;ee them for a fortnight at <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> and again for about a week in the middle of <HI>April,</HI> I am &s;eized with wonder, and long to be informed whence the&s;e travellers come, and whither they go, &s;ince they &s;eem to u&s;e our hills merely as an inn or baiting place.</P>
<P>Your account of the greater brambling, or &s;now-fleck, is very amu&s;ing; and &s;trange it is that &s;uch a &s;hort-winged bird &s;hould delight in &s;uch perilous voyages over the northern ocean! Some country people in the winter time have every now and then told me that they have &s;een two or three white larks on our downs; but, on con&s;idering the matter, I begin to &s;u&s;pect that the&s;e are &s;ome &s;tragglers of the birds we are talking of, which &s;ometimes perhaps may rove &s;o far to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>It plea&s;es me to find that white hares are &s;o frequent on the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> mountains, and e&s;pecially as you inform me that it is a di&s;tinct &s;pecies; for the quadrupeds of <HI>Britain</HI> are &s;o few, that every new &s;pecies is a great acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The eagle-owl, could it be proved to belong to us, is &s;o maje&s;tic a bird, that it would grace our <HI>fauna</HI> much. I never was informed before where wild-gee&s;e are known to breed.</P>
<P>You admit, I find, that I have proved your <HI>fen-&s;alicaria</HI> to be the le&s;&s;er reed-&s;parrow of <HI>Ray:</HI> and I think you may be &s;ecure
<PB N="75" REF="82">
that I am right; for I took very particular pains to clear up that matter, and had &s;ome fair &s;pecimens; but, as they were not well pre&s;erved, they are decayed already. You will, no doubt, in&s;ert it in it's proper place in your next edition. Your additional plates will much improve your work.</P>
<P><HI>De Buffon,</HI> I know, has de&s;cribed the water &s;hrew-mou&s;e: but &s;till I am plea&s;ed to find you have di&s;covered it in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> for the rea&s;on I have given in the article of the white hare.</P>
<P>As a neighbour was lately plowing in a dry chalky field, far removed from any water, he turned out a water-rat, that was curiou&s;ly laid up in an <HI>hybernaculum</HI> artificially formed of gra&s;s and leaves. At one end of the <HI>burrow</HI> lay above a gallon of potatoes regularly &s;towed, on which it was to have &s;upported it&s;elf for the winter. But the difficulty with me is how this <HI>amphibius mus</HI> came to fix it's winter &s;tation at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the water. Was it determined in it's choice of that place by the mere accident of finding the potatoes which were planted there; or is it the con&s;tant practice of the aquatic-rat to for&s;ake the neighbourhood of the water in the colder months?</P>
<P>Though I delight very little in analogous rea&s;oning, knowing how fallacious it is with re&s;pect to natural hi&s;tory; yet, in the following in&s;tance, I cannot help being inclined to think it may conduce towards the explanation of a difficulty that I have men|tioned before, with re&s;pect to the invariable early retreat of the <HI>hirundo apus,</HI> or &s;wift, &s;o many weeks before it's congeners; and that not only with us, but al&s;o in <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> where they al&s;o begin to retire about the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The great large bat<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The little bat appears almo&s;t every month in the year; but I have never &s;een the large ones till the end of <HI>April,</HI> nor after <HI>July.</HI> They are mo&s;t common in <HI>June,</HI> but never in any plenty: are a rare &s;pecies with us.</NOTE> (which by the by is at pre&s;ent a non|de&s;cript
<PB N="76" REF="83">
in <HI>England,</HI> and what I have never been able yet to procure) retires or migrates very early in the &s;ummer: it al&s;o ranges very high for it's food, feeding in a different region of the air; and that is the rea&s;on I never could procure one. Now this is exactly the ca&s;e with the &s;wifts; for they take their food in a more exalted region than the other &s;pecies, and are very &s;eldom &s;een hawking for flies near the ground, or over the &s;urface of the water. From hence I would conclude that the&s;e <HI>hirundines,</HI> and the larger bats, are &s;upported by &s;ome &s;orts of high-flying gnats, &s;carabs, or <HI>phalaenae,</HI> that are of &s;hort continuance; and that the &s;hort &s;tay of the&s;e &s;trangers is regulated by the defect of their food.</P>
<P>By my journal it appears that curlews clamoured on to <HI>October</HI> the thirty-fir&s;t; &s;ince which I have not &s;een or heard any. Swallows were ob&s;erved on to <HI>November</HI> the third.</P>

<P>HEDGE-HOGS abound in my gardens and fields. The manner in which they eat their roots of the plantain in my gra&s;s-walks is very curious: with their upper mandible, which is much longer than their lower, they bore under the plant, and &s;o eat the root off up|wards, leaving the tuft of leaves untouched. In this re&s;pect they
<PB N="77" REF="84">
are &s;erviceable, as they de&s;troy a very trouble&s;ome weed; but they deface the walks in &s;ome mea&s;ure by digging little round holes. It appears, by the dung that they drop upon the turf, that beetles are no incon&s;iderable part of their food. In <HI>June</HI> la&s;t I procured a litter of four or five young hedge-hogs, which appeared to be about five or &s;ix days old: they, I find, like puppies, are born blind, and could not &s;ee when they came to my hands. No doubt their &s;pines are &s;oft and flexible at the time of their birth, or el&s;e the poor dam would have but a bad time of it in the critical mo|ment of parturition: but it is plain that they &s;oon harden; for the&s;e little pigs had &s;uch &s;tiff prickles on their backs and &s;ides as would ea&s;ily have fetched blood, had they not been handled with caution. Their &s;pines are quite white at this age; and they have little hang|ing ears, which I do not remember to be di&s;cernible in the old ones. They can, in part, at this age draw their &s;kin down over their faces; but are not able to contract them&s;elves into a ball, as they do, for the &s;ake of defence, when full grown. The rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, is, becau&s;e the curious mu&s;cle that enables the creature to roll it&s;elf up in a ball was not then arrived at it's full tone and firmne&s;s. Hedge-hogs make a deep and warm <HI>hybernaculum</HI> with leaves and mo&s;s, in which they conceal them&s;elves for the winter: but I never could find that they &s;tored in any winter provi&s;ion, as &s;ome quadrupeds certainly do.</P>
<P>I have di&s;covered an anecdote with re&s;pect to the fieldfare <HI>(turdus pilaris),</HI> which I think is particular enough: this bird, though it &s;its on trees in the day-time, and procures the greate&s;t part of it's food from white-thorn hedges; yea, moreover, builds on very high trees; as may be &s;een by the <HI>fauna &s;uecica;</HI> yet always appears with us to roo&s;t on the ground. They are &s;een to come in flocks ju&s;t before it is dark, and to &s;ettle and ne&s;tle
<PB N="78" REF="85">
among the heath on our fore&s;t. And be&s;ides, the larkers, in dragging their nets by night, frequently catch them in the wheat|&s;tubbles; while the bat-fowlers, who take many red-wings in the hedges, never entangle any of this &s;pecies. Why the&s;e birds, in the matter of roo&s;ting, &s;hould differ from all their congeners, and from them&s;elves al&s;o with re&s;pect to their proceedings by day, is a fact for which I am by no means able to account.</P>
<P>I have &s;omewhat to inform you of concerning the <HI>moo&s;e-deer;</HI> but in general foreign animals fall &s;eldom in my way: my little intelligence is confined to the narrow &s;phere of my own ob&s;ervations at home.</P>

<P>ON <HI>Michaelmas-day</HI> 1768 I managed to get a &s;ight of the female moo&s;e belonging to the duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> at <HI>Goodwood;</HI> but was greatly di&s;appointed, when I arrived at the &s;pot, to find that it died, after having appeared in a langui&s;hing way for &s;ome time, on the morning before. However, under&s;tanding that it was not &s;tripped, I proceeded to examine this rare quadruped: I found it in an old green-hou&s;e, &s;lung under the belly and chin by ropes, and in a &s;tanding po&s;ture; but, though it had been dead for &s;o &s;hort a time, it was in &s;o putrid a &s;tate that the &s;tench was hardly
<PB N="79" REF="86">
&s;upportable. The grand di&s;tinction between this deer, and any other &s;pecies that I have ever met with, con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;trange length of it's legs; on which it was tilted up much in the manner of the birds of the <HI>grallae</HI> order. I mea&s;ured it, as they do an hor&s;e, and found that, from the ground to the wither, it was ju&s;t five feet four inches; which height an&s;wers exactly to &s;ixteen hands, a growth that few hor&s;es arrive at: but then, with this length of legs, it's neck was remarkably &s;hort, no more than twelve inches; &s;o that, by &s;traddling with one foot forward and the other back|ward, it grazed on the plain ground, with the greate&s;t difficulty, between it's legs: the ears were va&s;t and lopping, and as long as the neck; the head was about twenty inches long, and a&s;s-like; and had &s;uch a redundancy of upper lip as I never &s;aw before, with huge no&s;trils. This lip, travellers &s;ay, is e&s;teemed a dainty di&s;h in <HI>North America.</HI> It is very rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that this creature &s;upports it&s;elf chiefly by brow&s;ing of trees, and by wading after water plants; towards which way of livelihood the length of legs and great lip mu&s;t contribute much. I have read &s;omewhere that it delights in eating the <HI>nymphaea,</HI> or water-lily. From the fore-feet to the belly behind the &s;houlder it mea&s;ured three feet and eight inches: the length of the legs before and behind con&s;i&s;ted a great deal in the <HI>tibia,</HI> which was &s;trangely long; but, in my ha&s;te to get out of the &s;tench, I forgot to mea&s;ure that joint exactly. It's &s;cut &s;eemed to be about an inch long; the colour was a grizzly black; the mane about four inches long; the fore-hoofs were upright and &s;hapely, the hind flat and &s;played. The &s;pring before it was only two years old, &s;o that mo&s;t probably it was not then come to it's growth. What a va&s;t tall bea&s;t mu&s;t a full grown &s;tag be! I have been told &s;ome arrive at ten feet and an half! This poor creature had at fir&s;t a female companion of the
<PB N="80" REF="87">
&s;ame &s;pecies, which died the &s;pring before. In the &s;ame garden was a young &s;tag, or red deer, between whom and this moo&s;e it was hoped that there might have been a breed; but their inequality of height mu&s;t have always been a bar to any commerce of the amorous kind. I &s;hould have been glad to have examined the teeth, tongue, lips, hoofs, &amp;c. minutely; but the putrefaction precluded all farther curio&s;ity. This animal, the keeper told me, &s;eemed to enjoy it&s;elf be&s;t in the extreme fro&s;t of the former winter. In the hou&s;e they &s;hewed me the horn of a male moo&s;e, which had no front-antlers, but only a broad palm with &s;ome &s;nags on the edge. The noble owner of the dead moo&s;e propo&s;ed to make a &s;keleton of her bones.</P>

<P>LAST month we had &s;uch a &s;eries of cold turbulent weather, &s;uch a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fro&s;t, and &s;now, and hail, and tempe&s;t, that the regular migration or appearance of the &s;ummer birds was much interrupted. Some did not &s;hew them&s;elves (at

lea&s;t were not heard) till weeks after their u&s;ual time; as the <HI>black-cap</HI> and <HI>white-throat;</HI> and &s;ome have not been heard yet, as the <HI>gra&s;shopper-lark</HI> and large&s;t <HI>willow-wren.</HI> As to the <HI>fly-catcher,</HI> I have not &s;een it; it is indeed one of the late&s;t, but &s;hould appear about this time: and yet, amid&s;t all this meteorous &s;trife and war of the elements, two &s;wallows di&s;covered them&s;elves as long ago as the eleventh of <HI>April,</HI> in fro&s;t and &s;now; but they withdrew quickly, and were not vi&s;ible again for many days. Hou&s;e|martins, which are always more backward than &s;wallows, were not ob&s;erved till <HI>May</HI> came in.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>monogamous</HI> birds &s;everal are to be found, after pairing-time, &s;ingle, and of each &s;ex: but whether this &s;tate of celibacy is matter of choice or nece&s;&s;ity, is not &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cover|able. When the hou&s;e-&s;parrows deprive my martins of their ne&s;ts, as &s;oon as I cau&s;e one to be &s;hot, the other, be it cock or hen, pre&s;ently procures a mate, and &s;o for &s;everal times following.</P>
<P>I have known a dove-hou&s;e infe&s;ted by a pair of white owls, which made great havock among the young pigeons: one of the owls was &s;hot as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; but the &s;urvivor readily found a mate, and the mi&s;chief went on. After &s;ome time the new pair were both de&s;troyed, and the annoyance cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance I remember of a &s;port&s;man, who&s;e zeal for the increa&s;e of his game being greater than his humanity, after pairing-time he always &s;hot the cock-bird of every couple of partridges upon his grounds; &s;uppo&s;ing that the rivalry of many males interrupted the breed: he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that, though he had widowed the &s;ame hen &s;everal times, yet he found &s;he was &s;till provided with a fre&s;h paramour, that did not take her away from her u&s;ual haunt.</P>

<P>There is a propen&s;ity belonging to common hou&s;e-cats that is very remarkable; I mean their violent fondne&s;s for fi&s;h, which appears to be their mo&s;t favourite food: and yet nature in this in&s;tance &s;eems to have planted in them an appetite that, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, they know not how to gratify: for of all quadrupeds cats are the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ed towards water; and will not, when they can avoid it, deign to wet a foot, much le&s;s to plunge into that element.</P>
<P>Quadrupeds that prey on fi&s;h are amphibious: &s;uch is the otter, which by nature is &s;o well formed for diving, that it makes great havock among the inhabitants of the waters. Not &s;uppo&s;ing that we had any of tho&s;e bea&s;ts in our &s;hallow brooks, I was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee a male otter brought to me, weighing twenty-one pounds, that had been &s;hot on the bank of our &s;tream below the <HI>Priory,</HI> where the rivulet divides the pari&s;h of <HI>Selborne</HI> from <HI>Harteley-wood.</HI></P>

<P>I forgot to mention in my la&s;t letter (and had not room to in&s;ert in the former) that the male moo&s;e, in rutting time, &s;wims from i&s;land to i&s;land, in the lakes and rivers of <HI>North-America,</HI> in pur&s;uit of the females.

<P>When I was la&s;t in town our friend Mr. <HI>Barrington</HI> mo&s;t obligingly carried me to &s;ee many curious &s;ights.

<P>Mr. <HI>Barrington</HI> &s;hewed me many a&s;toni&s;hing collections of &s;tuffed and living birds from all quarters of the world. After I had &s;tudied over the latter for a time, I remarked that every &s;pecies almo&s;t that came from di&s;tant regions, &s;uch as <HI>South America,</HI> the coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> &amp;c. were thick-billed birds of the <HI>loxia</HI> and <HI>fringilla</HI> genera; and no <HI>motacillae,</HI> or <HI>mu&s;cicapae,</HI> were to be met with. When I came to con&s;ider, the rea&s;on was obvious enough; for the hard-billed birds &s;ub&s;i&s;t on &s;eeds which are ea&s;ily carried on board; while the &s;oft-billed birds, which are &s;upported by worms and in&s;ects, or, what is a <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> for them, fre&s;h raw meat, can meet with neither in long and tedious voyages. It is from this defect of food that our collections (curious as they are) are defective, and we are deprived of &s;ome of the mo&s;t delicate and lively genera.</P>

grey mo&s;&s;y flints, which much re&s;emble their young in colour; among which they &s;kulk and conceal them&s;elves.

and rai&s;ing tumours which itch intolerably. This animal (which we call an harve&s;t bug) is very minute, &s;carce di&s;cernible to the naked eye; of a bright &s;carlet colour, and of the genus of <HI>Acarus.</HI> They are to be met with in gardens on kidneybeans, or any legumens; but prevail only in the hot months of &s;ummer. Warreners, as &s;ome have a&s;&s;ured me, are much infe&s;ted by them on chalky downs; where the&s;e in&s;ects &s;warm &s;ometimes to &s;o infinite a degree as to di&s;colour their nets, and to give them a reddi&s;h ca&s;t, while the men are &s;o bitten as to be thrown into fevers.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall long &s;hining fly in the&s;e parts very trouble&s;ome to the hou&s;ewife, by getting into the chimnies, and laying it's eggs in the bacon while it is drying: the&s;e eggs produce maggots called <HI>jumpers,</HI> which, harbouring in the gammons and be&s;t parts of the hogs, eat down to the bone, and make great wa&s;te.

<P>The in&s;ect that infe&s;ts turnips and many crops in the garden (de&s;troying often whole fields while in their &s;eedling leaves) is an animal that wants to be better known.

<P>HAPPENING to make a vi&s;it to my neighbour's peacocks, I could not help ob&s;erving that the trains of tho&s;e magnificent birds appear by no means to be their tails; tho&s;e long feathers growing not from their <HI>uropygium,</HI> but all up their backs. A range of &s;hort brown &s;tiff feathers, about &s;ix inches long, fixed in the <HI>uropygium,</HI> is the real tail, and &s;erves as the <HI>fulcrum</HI> to prop the train, which is long and top-heavy, when &s;et an end. When the train is up, nothing appears of the bird before but it's head and neck; but this would not be the ca&s;e were tho&s;e long feathers fixed only in the rump, as may be &s;een by the turkey-cock when in a &s;trutting attitude. By a &s;trong mu&s;cular vibration the&s;e birds can make the &s;hafts of their long feathers clatter like the &s;words of a &s;word-dancer; they then trample very quick with their feet, and run backwards towards the females.</P>

<P>THE &s;ummer through I have &s;een but two of that large &s;pecies of bat which I call <HI>ve&s;pertilio altivolans,</HI> from it's manner of feeding high in the air: I procured one of them, and found it to be a male; and made no doubt, as they accompanied together, that the other was a female: but, happening in an evening or two to procure the other likewi&s;e, I was &s;omewhat di&s;appointed, when it appeared to be al&s;o of the &s;ame &s;ex.

<P>In the extent of their wings they mea&s;ured fourteen inches and an half; and four inches and an half from the no&s;e to the tip of the tail: their heads were large, their no&s;trils bilobated, their &s;houlders broad and mu&s;cular; and their whole bodies fle&s;hy and plump. Nothing could be more &s;leek and &s;oft than their fur, which was of a bright che&s;nut colour; their maws were full of

food, but &s;o macerated that the quality could not be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed; their livers, kidnies, and hearts, were large, and their bowels covered with fat. They weighed each, when entire, full one ounce and one drachm. Within the ear there was &s;omewhat of a peculiar &s;tructure that I did not under&s;tand perfectly; but refer it to the ob&s;ervation of the curious anatomi&s;t.

<P>BY my journal for la&s;t autumn it appears that the hou&s;e-martins bred very late, and &s;taid very late in the&s;e parts; for, on the fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> I &s;aw young martins in their ne&s;t nearly fledged; and again, on the twenty-fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> we had at the next hou&s;e a ne&s;t full of young martins ju&s;t ready to fly; and the old ones were hawking for in&s;ects with great alertne&s;s. The next
<PB N="96" REF="105">
morning the brood for&s;ook their ne&s;t, and were flying round the village. From this day I never &s;aw one of the &s;wallow kind till <HI>November</HI> the third; when twenty, or perhaps thirty, hou&s;e-mar|tins were playing all day long by the &s;ide of the hanging wood, and over my fields. Did the&s;e &s;mall weak birds, &s;ome of which were ne&s;tlings twelve days ago, &s;hift their quarters at this late &s;ea|&s;on of the year to the other &s;ide of the northern tropic? Or rather, is it not more probable that the next church, ruin, chalk-cliff, &s;teep covert, or perhaps &s;andbank, lake or pool (as a more northern naturali&s;t would &s;ay), may become their <HI>hybernaculum,</HI> and afford them a ready and obvious retreat?</P>
<P>We now begin to expect our vernal migration of ring-ou&s;els every week. Per&s;ons worthy of credit a&s;&s;ure me that ring-ou&s;els were &s;een at <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1770 in the fore&s;t of <HI>Bere,</HI> on the &s;outhern verge of this county. Hence we may conclude that their migra|tions are only internal, and not extended to the continent &s;outh|ward, if they do at fir&s;t come at all from the northern parts of this i&s;land only, and not from the north of <HI>Europe.</HI> Come from whence they will, it is plain, from the fearle&s;s di&s;regard that they &s;hew for men or guns, that they have been little accu&s;tomed to places of much re&s;ort. Navigators mention that in the <HI>I&s;le of A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> and other &s;uch de&s;olate di&s;tricts, birds are &s;o little acquaint|ed with the human form that they &s;ettle on men's &s;houlders; and have no more dread of a &s;ailor than they would have of a goat that was grazing.

<P>BEFORE your letter arrived, and of my own accord, I had been remarking and comparing the tails of the male and female &s;wallow, and this ere any young broods appeared; &s;o that there was no danger of confounding the dams with their <HI>pulli:</HI> and be|&s;ides, as they were then always in pairs, and bu&s;ied in the employ of nidification, there could be no room for mi&s;taking the &s;exes, nor the individuals of different chimnies the one for the other. From all my ob&s;ervations, it con&s;tantly appeared that each &s;ex
<PB N="101" REF="110">
has the long feathers in it's tail that give it that forked &s;hape; with this difference, that they are longer in the tail of the male than in that of the female.</P>
<P>Nightingales, when their young fir&s;t come abroad, and are helple&s;s, make a plaintive and a jarring noi&s;e; and al&s;o a &s;napping or cracking, pur&s;uing people along the hedges as they walk: the&s;e la&s;t &s;ounds &s;eem intended for menace and defiance.</P>
<P>The gra&s;shopper-lark chirps all night in the height of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Swans turn white the &s;econd year, and breed the third.</P>
<P>Wea&s;els prey on moles, as appears by their being &s;ometimes caught in mole-traps.</P>
<P>Sparrow-hawks &s;ometimes breed in old crows' ne&s;ts, and the ke&s;tril in churches and ruins.</P>
<P>There are &s;uppo&s;ed to be two &s;orts of eels in the i&s;land of <HI>Ely.</HI> The threads &s;ometimes di&s;covered in eels are perhaps their young: the generation of eels is very dark and my&s;terious.</P>
<P>Hen-harriers breed on the ground, and &s;eem never to &s;ettle on trees.</P>
<P>When red&s;tarts &s;hake their tails they move them horizontally, as dogs do when they fawn: the tail of a wagtail, when in motion, bobs up and down like that of a jaded hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Hedge-&s;parrows have a remarkable flirt with their wings in breeding-time; as &s;oon as fro&s;ty mornings come they make a very piping plaintive noi&s;e.</P>
<P>Many birds which become &s;ilent about <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> rea&s;&s;ume their notes again in <HI>September;</HI> as the thru&s;h, blackbird, wood|lark, willow-wren, &amp;c.; hence <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> is by much the mo&s;t mute month, the &s;pring, &s;ummer, and autumn through. Are birds induced to &s;ing again becau&s;e the temperament of autumn re|&s;embles that of &s;pring?</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="111">
<HI>Linnaeus</HI> ranges plants geographically; palms inhabit the tropics, gra&s;&s;es the temperate zones, and mo&s;&s;es and lichens the polar circles; no doubt animals may be cla&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner with propriety.</P>
<P>Hou&s;e-&s;parrows build under eaves in the &s;pring; as the weather becomes hotter they get out for coolne&s;s, and ne&s;t in plum-trees and apple-trees. The&s;e birds have been known &s;ometimes to build in rooks' ne&s;ts, and &s;ometimes in the forks of boughs under rooks' ne&s;ts.</P>
<P>As my neighbour was hou&s;ing a rick he ob&s;erved that his dogs devoured all the little red mice that they could catch, but rejected the common mice; and that his cats ate the common mice, refu&s;ing the red.</P>
<P>Red-brea&s;ts &s;ing all through the &s;pring, &s;ummer, and autumn. The rea&s;on that they are called autumn &s;ong&s;ters is, becau&s;e in the two fir&s;t &s;ea&s;ons their voices are drowned and lo&s;t in the general chorus; in the latter their &s;ong becomes di&s;tingui&s;hable. Many &s;ong&s;ters of the autumn &s;eem to be the young cock red-brea&s;ts of that year: notwith&s;tanding the prejudices in their favour, they do much mi&s;chief in gardens to the &s;ummer-fruits<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">They eat al&s;o the berries of the ivy, the honey-&s;uckle, and the <HI>euonymus europaeus,</HI> or &s;pindle-tree.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The appearance and flying of the <HI>&s;carabaeus &s;ol&s;titialis,</HI> or fern|chafer, commence with the month of <HI>July,</HI> and cea&s;e about the end of it. The&s;e &s;carabs are the con&s;tant food of <HI>caprimulgi,</HI> or fern owls, through that period. They abound on the chalky downs and in &s;ome &s;andy di&s;tricts, but not in the clays.</P>
<P>In the garden of the <HI>Black-bear</HI> inn in the town of <HI>Reading</HI> is a &s;tream or canal running under the &s;tables and out into the fields on the other &s;ide of the road: in this water are many carps, which lie rolling about in &s;ight, being fed by travellers, who amu&s;e them&s;elves by to&s;&s;ing them bread: but as &s;oon as the weather grows at all &s;evere the&s;e fi&s;hes are no longer &s;een, becau&s;e they retire under the &s;tables, where they remain till the return of &s;pring. Do they lie in a torpid &s;tate? if they do not, how are they &s;upported?</P>
<P>The note of the white-throat, which is continually repeated, and often attended with odd ge&s;ticulations on the wing, is har&s;h and di&s;plea&s;ing. The&s;e birds &s;eem of a pugnacious di&s;po&s;ition; for they &s;ing with an erected cre&s;t and attitudes of rivalry and de|fiance; are &s;hy and wild in breeding-time, avoiding neighbour|hoods, and haunting lonely lanes and commons; nay even the very tops of the <HI>Su&s;&s;ex-downs,</HI> where there are bu&s;hes and covert; but in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> they bring their broods into gardens and orchards, and make great havock among the &s;ummer-fruits.</P>
<P>The black-cap has in common a full, &s;weet, deep, loud, and wild pipe; yet that &s;train is of &s;hort continuance, and his motions are de&s;ultory; but when that bird &s;its calmly and engages in &s;ong
<PB N="104" REF="113">
in earne&s;t, he pours forth very &s;weet, but inward melody, and expre&s;&s;es great variety of &s;oft and gentle modulations, &s;uperior perhaps to tho&s;e of any of our warblers, the nightingale excepted.</P>
<P>Black-caps mo&s;tly haunt orchards and gardens; while they warble their throats are wonderfully di&s;tended.</P>
<P>The &s;ong of the red&s;tart is &s;uperior, though &s;omewhat like that of the white-throat: &s;ome birds have a few more notes than others. Sitting very placidly on the top of a tall tree in a village, the cock &s;ings from morning to night: he affects neighbourhoods, and avoids &s;olitude, and loves to build in orchards and about hou&s;es; with us he perches on the vane of a tall maypole.</P>
<P>The fly-catcher is of all our &s;ummer birds the mo&s;t mute and the mo&s;t familiar; it al&s;o appears the la&s;t of any. It builds in a vine, or a &s;weetbriar, again&s;t the wall of an hou&s;e, or in the hole of a wall, or on the end of a beam or plate, and often clo&s;e to the po&s;t of a door where people are going in and out all day long. This bird does not make the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to &s;ong, but u&s;es a little inward wailing note when it thinks it's young in danger from cats or other annoyances: it breeds but once, and retires early.</P>

<P>IT is matter of curious inquiry to trace out how tho&s;e &s;pecies of &s;oft-billed birds, that continue with us the winter through, &s;ub&s;i&s;t during the dead months. The imbecility of birds &s;eems not to be the only rea&s;on why they &s;hun the rigour of our winters; for the robu&s;t <HI>wry-neck</HI> (&s;o much re&s;embling the hardy race of <HI>wood-peckers</HI>) migrates, while the feeble little <HI>golden-crowned wren,</HI> that &s;hadow of a bird, braves our &s;evere&s;t fro&s;ts without availing him&s;elf of hou&s;es or villages, to which mo&s;t of our winter-birds crowd in di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ea&s;ons, while this keeps aloof in fields and woods; but perhaps this may be the rea&s;on why they may often peri&s;h, and why they are almo&s;t as rare as any bird we know.</P>
<P>I have no rea&s;on to doubt but that the &s;oft-billed birds, which winter with us, &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on in&s;ects in their <HI>aurelia</HI> &s;tate. All the &s;pecies of <HI>wagtails</HI> in &s;evere weather haunt &s;hallow &s;treams near their &s;pring-heads, where they never freeze; and, by wading, pick out the aurelias of the genus of <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Derham</HI>'s Phy&s;ico-theology, p. 235.</NOTE> <HI>Phryganeae,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Hedge-&s;parrows</HI> frequent &s;inks and gutters in hard weather, where they pick up crumbs and other &s;weepings: and in mild weather they procure worms, which are &s;tirring every month in the year, as any one may &s;ee that will only be at the trouble of taking a candle to a gra&s;s-plot on any mild winter's night. Red|brea&s;ts and wrens in the winter haunt out-hou&s;es, &s;tables, and barns,
<PB N="106" REF="115">
where they find &s;piders and flies that have laid them&s;elves up during the cold &s;ea&s;on. But the grand &s;upport of the &s;oft-billed birds in winter is that infinite profu&s;ion of <HI>aureliae</HI> of the <HI>lepidoptera ordo,</HI> which is fa&s;tened to the twigs of trees and their trunks; to the pales and walls of gardens and buildings; and is found in every cranny and cleft of rock or rubbi&s;h, and even in the ground it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of titmou&s;e winters with us; they have what I call a kind of intermediate bill between the hard and the &s;oft, be|tween the <HI>Linnaean</HI> genera of <HI>fringilla</HI> and <HI>motacilla.</HI> One &s;pecies alone &s;pends it's whole time in the woods and fields, never retreat|ing for &s;uccour in the &s;evere&s;t &s;ea&s;ons to hou&s;es and neighbour|hoods; and that is the delicate long-tailed titmou&s;e, which is almo&s;t as minute as the golden-crowned wren: but the blue tit|mou&s;e, or nun <HI>(parus caeruleus),</HI> the cole-mou&s;e <HI>(parus ater),</HI> the great black-headed titmou&s;e <HI>(fringillago),</HI> and the mar&s;h titmou&s;e <HI>(parus palu&s;tris),</HI> all re&s;ort, at times, to buildings; and in hard weather particularly. The great titmou&s;e, driven by &s;tre&s;s of weather, much frequents hou&s;es; and, in deep &s;nows, I have &s;een this bird, while it hung with it's back downwards (to my no &s;mall delight and admiration), draw &s;traws lengthwi&s;e from out the eaves of thatched hou&s;es, in order to pull out the flies that were concealed between them, and that in &s;uch numbers that they quite defaced the thatch, and gave it a ragged appearance.</P>
<P>The blue <HI>titmou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>nun,</HI> is a great frequenter of hou&s;es, and a general devourer. Be&s;ides in&s;ects, it is very fond of fle&s;h; for it frequently picks bones on dunghills: it is a va&s;t admirer of &s;uet, and haunts butchers' &s;hops. When a boy, I have known twenty in a morning caught with &s;nap mou&s;e-traps, baited with tallow or &s;uet. It will al&s;o pick holes in apples left on the ground, and
<PB N="107" REF="116">
be well entertained with the &s;eeds on the head of a &s;un-flower. The blue, mar&s;h, and great titmice will, in very &s;evere weather, carry away barley and oat &s;traws from the &s;ides of ricks.</P>
<P>How the <HI>wheat-ear</HI> and <HI>whin-chat</HI> &s;upport them&s;elves in winter cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily a&s;certained, &s;ince they &s;pend their time on wild heaths and warrens; the former e&s;pecially, where there are &s;tone quarries: mo&s;t probably it is that their maintenance ari&s;es from the <HI>aureliae</HI> of the <HI>lepidoptera ordo,</HI> which furni&s;h them with a plentiful table in the wilderne&s;s.</P>

<P>SOME future <HI>fauni&s;t.</HI> a man of fortune, will, I hope, extend his vi&s;its to the kingdom of <HI>Ireland;</HI> a new field, and a country little known to the naturali&s;t. He will not, it is to be wi&s;hed, under|take that tour unaccompanied by a botani&s;t, becau&s;e the mountains have &s;carcely been &s;ufficiently examined; and the &s;outherly coun|ties of &s;o mild an i&s;land may po&s;&s;ibly afford &s;ome plants little to be expected within the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions. A per&s;on of a thinking turn of mind will draw many ju&s;t remarks from the modern im|provements of that country, both in arts and agriculture, where premiums obtained long before they were heard of with us. The manners of the wild natives, their &s;uper&s;titions, their prejudices,
<PB N="108" REF="117">
their &s;ordid way of life, will extort from him many u&s;eful reflec|tions. He &s;hould al&s;o take with him an able draught&s;man; for he mu&s;t by no means pa&s;s over the noble ca&s;tles and &s;eats, the exten&s;ive and picture&s;que lakes and waterfalls, and the lofty &s;tupendous mountains, &s;o little known, and &s;o engaging to the imagination when de&s;cribed and exhibited in a lively manner: &s;uch a work would be well received.</P>
<P>As I have &s;een no modern map of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I cannot pretend to &s;ay how accurate or particular any &s;uch may be; but this I know, that the be&s;t old maps of that kingdom are very defective.</P>
<P>The great obvious defect that I have remarked in all maps of <HI>Scotland</HI> that have fallen in my way is, a want of a <HI>coloured line,</HI> or <HI>&s;troke,</HI> that &s;hall exactly define the ju&s;t limits of that di&s;trict called <HI>The Highlands.</HI> Moreover, all the great avenues to that moun|tainous and romantic country want to be well di&s;tingui&s;hed. The military roads formed by general <HI>Wade</HI> are &s;o great and Roman-like an undertaking that they well merit attention. My old map, <HI>Moll</HI>'s Map, takes notice of <HI>Fort William;</HI> but could not mention the other forts that have been erected long &s;ince: therefore a good repre&s;entation of the chain of forts &s;hould not be omitted.</P>
<P>The celebrated zigzag up the <HI>Coryarich</HI> mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over. <HI>Moll</HI> takes notice of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Drumlanrig,</HI> and &s;uch capital hou&s;es; but a new &s;urvey, no doubt, &s;hould repre&s;ent every &s;eat and ca&s;tle remarkable for any great event, or celebrated for it's paintings, &amp;c. Lord <HI>Breadalbane</HI>'s &s;eat and beautiful <HI>policy</HI> are too curious and extraordinary to be omitted.</P>
<P>The &s;eat of the Earl of <HI>Eglintoun,</HI> near <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> is worthy of notice. The pine-plantations of that nobleman are very grand and exten&s;ive indeed.</P>

<P>A PAIR of <HI>honey-buzzards, buteo apivorus, five ve&s;pivorus Raii,</HI> built them a large &s;hallow ne&s;t, compo&s;ed of twigs and lined with dead beechen leaves, upon a tall &s;lender beech near the middle of <HI>Selborne-hanger,</HI> in the &s;ummer of 1780. In the middle of the month of <HI>June</HI> a bold boy climbed this tree, though &s;tanding on &s;o &s;teep and dizzy a &s;ituation, and brought down an egg, the only one in the ne&s;t, which had been &s;at on for &s;ome time, and contain|ed the embrio of a young bird. The egg was &s;maller, and not &s;o round as tho&s;e of the common buzzard; was dotted at each end with &s;mall red &s;pots, and &s;urrounded in the middle with a broad bloody zone.</P>
<P>The hen-bird was &s;hot, and an&s;wered exactly to Mr. <HI>Ray</HI>'s de|&s;cription of that &s;pecies; had a black <HI>cere,</HI> &s;hort thick legs, and a long tail. When on the wing this &s;pecies may be ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the <HI>common buzzard</HI> by it's hawk-like appearance, &s;mall head, wings not &s;o blunt, and longer tail. This &s;pecimen contained in it's craw &s;ome limbs of frogs and many grey &s;nails without &s;hells. The <HI>irides</HI> of the eyes of this bird were of a beautiful bright yellow colour.</P>
<P>About the tenth of <HI>July</HI> in the &s;ame &s;ummer a pair of <HI>&s;parrow-hawks</HI> bred in an old crow's ne&s;t on a low beech in the &s;ame hanger; and as their brood, which was numerous, began to grow
<PB N="110" REF="119">
up, became &s;o daring and ravenous, that they were a terror to all the dames in the village that had chickens or ducklings under their care. A boy climbed the tree, and found the young &s;o fledged that they all e&s;caped from him; but di&s;covered that a good hou&s;e had been kept: the larder was well-&s;tored with provi&s;ions; for he brought down a young blackbird, jay, and hou&s;e-martin, all clean picked, and &s;ome half devoured. The old birds had been ob&s;erved to make &s;ad havock for &s;ome days among the new-flown &s;wallows and martins, which, being but lately out of their ne&s;ts, had not acquired tho&s;e powers and com|mand of wing that enable them, when more mature, to &s;et &s;uch enemies at defiance.</P>

<P>EVERY incident that occa&s;ions a renewal of our corre&s;pondence will ever be plea&s;ing and agreeable to me.</P>
<P>As to the wild <HI>wood-pigeon,</HI> the <HI>oenas,</HI> or <HI>vinago,</HI> of <HI>Ray,</HI> I am much of your mind; and &s;ee no rea&s;on for making it the origin of the common <HI>hou&s;e-dove:</HI> but &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e that have advanced that opinion may have been mi&s;led by another appellation, often given to the <HI>oenas,</HI> which is that of <HI>&s;tock-dove,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="120">
Unle&s;s the &s;tock-dove in the winter varies greatly in manners from it&s;elf in &s;ummer, no &s;pecies &s;eems more unlikely to be dome&s;ticated, and to make an <HI>hou&s;e-dove.</HI> We very rarely &s;ee the latter &s;ettle on trees at all, nor does it ever haunt the woods; but the former, as long as it &s;tays with us, from <HI>November</HI> perhaps to <HI>February,</HI> lives the &s;ame wild life with the <HI>ring-dove, palumbus torquatus;</HI> frequents coppices and groves, &s;upports it&s;elf chiefly by ma&s;t, and delights to roo&s;t in the talle&s;t beeches. Could it be known in what manner &s;tock-doves build, the doubt would be &s;ettled with me at once, provided they con&s;truct their ne&s;ts on trees, like the <HI>ring-dove,</HI> as I much &s;u&s;pect they do.</P>
<P>You received, you &s;ay, la&s;t &s;pring a <HI>&s;tock-dove</HI> from <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> and are informed that they &s;ometimes breed in that country. But why did not your corre&s;pondent determine the place of it's nidification, whether on rocks, cliffs, or trees? If he was not an adroit orni|thologi&s;t I &s;hould doubt the fact, becau&s;e people with us perpetually confound the <HI>&s;tock-dove</HI> with the <HI>ring-dove.</HI></P>
<P>For my own part, I readily concur with you in &s;uppo&s;ing that hou&s;e-doves are derived from the <HI>&s;mall blue rock-pigeon,</HI> for many rea&s;ons. In the fir&s;t place the wild &s;tock-dove is manife&s;tly larger than the common hou&s;e-dove, again&s;t the u&s;ual rule of dome&s;tica|tion, which generally enlarges the breed. Again, tho&s;e two remarkable <HI>black &s;pots</HI> on the remiges of each wing of the &s;tock-dove, which are &s;o characteri&s;tic of the &s;pecies, would not, one &s;hould think, be totally lo&s;t by it's being reclaimed; but would often break out among its de&s;cendants. But what is worth an hundred arguments is, the in&s;tance you give in Sir <HI>Roger Mo&s;lyn</HI>'s hou&s;e-doves in <HI>Caernarvon&s;hire;</HI> which, though tempted by plenty of food and gentle treatment, can never be prevailed on to
<PB N="112" REF="121">
inhabit their cote for any time; but, as &s;oon as they begin to breed, betake them&s;elves to the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of <HI>Orm&s;head,</HI> and depo&s;it their young in &s;afety amid&s;t the inacce&s;&s;ible caverns, and preci|pices of that &s;tupendous promontory.</P>
<Q><L>"Naturam expellas furc&acirc; ... tamen u&s;que recurret."</L></Q>
<P>I have con&s;ulted a &s;port&s;man, now in his &s;eventy-eighth year, who tells me that fifty or &s;ixty years back, when the beechen woods were much more exten&s;ive than at pre&s;ent, the number of wood-pigeons was a&s;toni&s;hing; that he has often killed near twenty in a day; and that with a long wild-fowl piece he has &s;hot &s;even or eight at a time on the wing as they came wheeling over his head: he moreover adds, which I was not aware of, that often there were among them little parties of &s;mall <HI>blue doves,</HI> which he calls <HI>rockiers.</HI> The food of the&s;e numberle&s;s emigrants was beech-ma&s;t and &s;ome acorns; and particularly barley, which they collected in the &s;tubbles. But of late years, &s;ince the va&s;t increa&s;e of turnips, that vegetable has furni&s;hed a great part of their &s;upport in hard weather; and the holes they pick in the&s;e roots greatly damage the crop. From this food their fle&s;h has contracted a rancidne&s;s which occa&s;ions them to be rejected by nicer judges of eating, who thought them before a delicate di&s;h. They were &s;hot not only as they were feeding in the fields, and e&s;pecially in &s;nowy weather, but al&s;o at the clo&s;e of the evening, by men who lay in ambu&s;h among the woods and groves to kill them as they came in to roo&s;t.<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Some old &s;port&s;men &s;ay that the main part of the&s;e flocks u&s;ed to withdraw as &s;oon as the heavy <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> fro&s;ts were over.</NOTE>. The&s;e are the principal circum&s;tances relating to this
<PB N="113" REF="122">
wonderful <HI>internal</HI> migration, which with us takes place towards the end of <HI>November,</HI> and cea&s;es early in the &s;pring. La&s;t winter we had in <HI>Selborne</HI> high wood about an hundred of the&s;e doves; but in former times the flocks were &s;o va&s;t, not only with us but all the di&s;trict round, that on mornings and evenings they traver&s;ed the air, like rooks, in &s;trings, reaching for a mile together. When they thus rendezvou&s;ed here by thou&s;ands, if they happened to be &s;uddenly rou&s;ed from their roo&s;t-trees on an evening,
<Q><L>"Their ri&s;ing all at once was like the &s;ound</L>
<L>"Of thunder heard remote."&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>It will by no means be foreign to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to add, that I had a relation in this neighbourhood who made it a practice, for a time, whenever he could procure the eggs of a <HI>ring-dove,</HI> to place them under a pair of doves that were &s;itting in his own pigeon-hou&s;e; hoping thereby, if he could bring about a coalition, to enlarge his breed, and teach his own doves to beat out into the woods and to &s;upport them&s;elves by ma&s;t: the plan was plau&s;ible, but &s;omething always interrupted the &s;ucce&s;s; for though the birds were u&s;ually hatched, and &s;ometimes grew to half their &s;ize, yet none ever arrived at maturity. I my&s;elf have &s;een the&s;e foundlings in their ne&s;t di&s;playing a &s;trange ferocity of nature, &s;o as &s;carcely to bear to be looked at, and &s;napping with their bills by way of menace. In &s;hort, they always died, perhaps for want of proper &s;u&s;tenance: but the owner thought that by their fierce and wild demeanour they frighted their fo&s;ter-mothers, and &s;o were &s;tarved.</P>
<P><HI>Virgil,</HI> as a familiar occurrence, by way of &s;imile, de&s;cribes a dove haunting the cavern of a rock in &s;uch engaging numbers, that I cannot refrain from quoting the pa&s;&s;age: and <HI>John Dryden</HI>

<P>IT was no &s;mall matter of &s;atisfaction to me to find that you were not di&s;plea&s;ed with my little <HI>methodus</HI> of birds. If there was any merit in the &s;ketch, it mu&s;t be owing to it's punctuality. For many months I carried a li&s;t in my pocket of the birds that were to be remarked, and, as I rode or walked about my bu&s;ine&s;s, I noted each day the continuance or omi&s;&s;ion of each bird's &s;ong; &s;o that I am as &s;ure of the certainty of my facts as a man can be of any tran&s;action what&s;oever.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to an&s;wer the &s;everal queries which you put in your two obliging letters, in the be&s;t manner that I am able. Perhaps <HI>Ea&s;twick,</HI> and it's environs, where you heard &s;o very few birds, is not a woodland country, and therefore not &s;tocked with &s;uch &s;ong&s;ters. If you will ca&s;t your eye on my la&s;t letter, you will find that many &s;pecies continued to warble after the beginning of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>The titlark and yellowhammer breed late, the latter very late; and therefore it is no wonder that they protract their &s;ong: for I lay it down as a maxim in ornithology, that as long as there is any incubation going on there is mu&s;ic. As to the redbrea&s;t and wren, it is well known to the mo&s;t incurious ob&s;erver that they whi&s;tle the year round, hard fro&s;t excepted; e&s;pecially the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="133">
It was not in my power to procure you a black-cap, or a le&s;s reed-&s;parrow, or &s;edge-bird, alive. As the fir&s;t is undoubtedly, and the la&s;t, as far as I can yet &s;ee, a &s;ummer bird of pa&s;&s;age, they would require more nice and curious management in a cage than I &s;hould be able to give them: they are both di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ong&s;ters. The note of the former has &s;uch a wild &s;weetne&s;s that it always brings to my mind tho&s;e lines in a &s;ong in "<HI>As You Like It.</HI>"<Q><L>"And tune his merry note</L>
<L>"Unto the <HI>wild</HI> bird's throat."</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The latter has a &s;urpri&s;ing variety of notes re&s;embling the &s;ong of &s;everal other birds; but then it has al&s;o an hurrying manner, not at all to it's advantage: it is notwith&s;tanding a delicate polyglot.</P>
<P>It is new to me that titlarks in cages &s;ing in the night; perhaps only caged birds do &s;o. I once knew a tame redbrea&s;t in a cage that always &s;ang as long as candles were in the room; but in their wild &s;tate no one &s;uppo&s;es they &s;ing in the night.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be almo&s;t ready to doubt the fact, that there are to be &s;een much fewer birds in <HI>July</HI> than in any former month, notwith|&s;tanding &s;o many young are hatched daily. Sure I am that it is far otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;wallow tribe,</HI> which increa&s;es prodigiou&s;ly as the &s;ummer advances: and I &s;aw, at the time men|tioned, many hundreds of young wagtails on the banks of the <HI>Cherwell,</HI> which almo&s;t covered the meadows. If the matter ap|pears as you &s;ay in the other &s;pecies, may it not be owing to the dams being engaged in incubation, while the young are concealed by the leaves?</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="134">
Many times have I had the curio&s;ity to open the &s;tomachs of <HI>woodcocks</HI> and <HI>&s;nipes;</HI> but nothing ever occurred that helped to explain to me what their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence might be: all that I could ever find was a &s;oft mucus, among which lay many pellucid &s;mall gravels.</P>

<P>YOUR ob&s;ervation that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the <HI>cuckoo</HI> does not depo&s;it it's egg in|di&s;criminately in the ne&s;t of the fir&s;t bird that comes in it's way, but probably looks out a nur&s;e in &s;ome degree congenerous, with whom to intru&s;t it's young,"</Q> is perfectly new to me; and &s;truck me &s;o forcibly, that I naturally fell into a train of thought that led me to con&s;ider whether the fact was &s;o, and what rea&s;on there was for it.

This proceeding of the cuckoo, of dropping it's eggs as it were by chance, is &s;uch a mon&s;trous outrage on maternal affection, one of the fir&s;t great dictates of nature; and &s;uch a violence on in&s;tinct; that, had it only been related of a bird in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> or <HI>Peru,</HI> it would never have merited our belief.

<P>I HEARD many birds of &s;everal &s;pecies &s;ing la&s;t year after <HI>Mid|&s;ummer;</HI> enough to prove that the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice is not the period that puts a &s;top to the mu&s;ic of the woods. The yellowhammer no doubt per&s;i&s;ts with more &s;teadine&s;s than any other; but the woodlark, the wren, the redbrea&s;t, the &s;wallow, the white-throat, the goldfinch, the common linnet, are all undoubted in&s;tances of the truth of what I advanced.</P>
<P>If this &s;evere &s;ea&s;on does not interrupt the regularity of the &s;um|mer migrations, the blackcap will be here in two or three days. I wi&s;h it was in my power to procure you one of tho&s;e &s;ong&s;ters; but I am no birdcatcher; and &s;o little u&s;ed to birds in a cage, that I fear if I had one it would &s;oon die for want of &s;kill in feeding.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="137">
Was your reed-&s;parrow, which you kept in a cage, the thick-billed reed-&s;parrow of the Zoology, p. 320; or was it the le&s;s reed-&s;parrow of <HI>Ray,</HI> the <HI>&s;edge-bird</HI> of Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI>'s la&s;t publication, p. 16?</P>
<P>As to the matter of long-billed birds growing fatter in moderate fro&s;ts, I have no doubt within my&s;elf what &s;hould be the rea&s;on. The thriving at tho&s;e times appears to me to ari&s;e altogether from the gentle check which the cold throws upon in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. The ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame with blackbirds, &amp;c.; and farmers and warreners ob&s;erve, the fir&s;t, that their hogs fat more kindly at &s;uch times, and the latter that their rabbits are never in &s;uch good ca&s;e as in a gentle fro&s;t. But when fro&s;ts are &s;evere, and of long con|tinuance, the ca&s;e is &s;oon altered; for then a want of food &s;oon overbalances the repletion occa&s;ioned by a checked per&s;piration. I have ob&s;erved, moreover, that &s;ome human con&s;titutions are more inclined to plumpne&s;s in winter than in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>When birds come to &s;uffer by &s;evere fro&s;t, I find that the fir&s;t that fail and die are the redwing-fieldfares, and then the &s;ong-thru&s;hes.</P>
<P>You wonder, with good rea&s;on, that the hedge-&s;parrows, &amp;c. can be induced at all to &s;it on the egg of the cuckoo without being &s;can|dalized at the va&s;t di&s;proportioned &s;ize of the &s;uppo&s;ititious egg; but the brute creation, I &s;uppo&s;e, have very little idea of &s;ize, colour, or number. For the common hen, I know, when the fury of incubation is on her, will &s;it on a &s;ingle &s;hapele&s;s &s;tone in|&s;tead of a ne&s;t full of eggs that have been withdrawn: and, more|over, a hen-turkey, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, would &s;it on in the empty ne&s;t till &s;he peri&s;hed with hunger.</P>
<P>I think the matter might ea&s;ily be determined whether a cuckoo lays one or two eggs, or more, in a &s;ea&s;on, by opening a female
<PB N="129" REF="138">
during the laying-time. If more than one was come down out of the ovary, and advanced to a good &s;ize, doubtle&s;s then &s;he would that &s;pring lay more than one.</P>
<P>I will endeavour to get a hen, and to examine.</P>
<P>Your &s;uppo&s;ition that there may be &s;ome natural ob&s;truction in &s;inging birds while they are mute, and that when this is removed the &s;ong recommences, is new and bold: I wi&s;h you could di&s;|cover &s;ome good grounds for this &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>I was glad you were plea&s;ed with my &s;pecimen of the <HI>caprimulgus,</HI> or fern-owl; you were, I find, acquainted with the bird before.</P>
<P>When we meet I &s;hall be glad to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with you concerning the propo&s;al you make of my drawing up an account of the animals in this neighbourhood. Your partiality towards my &s;mall abilities per&s;uades you, I fear, that I am able to do more than is in my power: for it is no &s;mall undertaking for a man un&s;upported and alone to begin a natural hi&s;tory from his own autop&s;ia! Though there is endle&s;s room for ob&s;ervation in the field of nature, which is boundle&s;s, yet inve&s;tigation (where a man endeavours to be &s;ure of his facts) can make but &s;low pro|gre&s;s; and all that one could collect in many years would go into a very narrow compa&s;s.</P>
<P>Some extracts from your ingenious <Q REND="inline">"Inve&s;tigations of the dif|ference between the pre&s;ent temperature of the air in Italy,"</Q> &amp;c. have fallen in my way; and gave me great &s;atisfaction: they have removed the objections that always aro&s;e in my mind whenever I came to the pa&s;&s;ages which you quote. Surely the judicious <HI>Virgil,</HI> when writing a didactic poem for the region of <HI>Italy,</HI> could never think of de&s;cribing freezing rivers, unle&s;s &s;uch &s;everity of weather pretty frequently occurred!</P>

<P>THE &s;everity and turbulence of la&s;t month &s;o interrupted the re|gular proce&s;s of &s;ummer migration, that &s;ome of the birds do but ju&s;t begin to &s;hew them&s;elves, and others are apparently thinner than u&s;ual; as the white-throat, the black-cap, the red&s;tart, the fly-catcher. I well remember that after the very &s;evere &s;pring in the year 1739-40 &s;ummer birds of pa&s;&s;age were very &s;carce. They come probably hither with a &s;outh-ea&s;t wind, or when it blows between tho&s;e points; but in that unfavourable year the winds blowed the whole &s;pring and &s;ummer through from the oppo&s;ite quarters. And yet amid&s;t all the&s;e di&s;advantages two &s;wallows, as I mentioned in my la&s;t, appeared this year as early as the eleventh of <HI>April</HI> amid&s;t fro&s;t and &s;now; but they withdrew again for a time.</P>
<P>I am not plea&s;ed to find that &s;ome people &s;eem &s;o little &s;atisfied with <HI>Scopoli</HI>'s new publication<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">This work he calls his <HI>Annus Primus Hi&s;torico Naturalis.</HI></NOTE>; there is room to expect great things from the hands of that man, who is a good naturali&s;t: and one would think that an hi&s;tory of the birds of &s;o di&s;tant and &s;outhern a region as <HI>Carniola</HI> would be new and intere&s;ting. I could wi&s;h to &s;ee that work, and hope to get it &s;ent down. Dr. <HI>Scopoli</HI> is phy&s;ician to the wretches that work in the quick&s;ilver mines of that di&s;trict.</P>
<P>When you talked of keeping a reed-&s;parrow, and giving it &s;eeds, I could not help wondering; becau&s;e the reed-&s;parrow which I mentioned to you <HI>(pa&s;&s;er arundinaceus minor Raii)</HI> is a &s;oft|billed bird; and mo&s;t probably migrates hence before winter;
<PB N="131" REF="140">
whereas the bird you kept <HI>(pa&s;&s;er torquatus Raii)</HI> abides all the year, and is a thick-billed bird. I que&s;tion whether the latter be much of a &s;ong&s;ter; but in this matter I want to be better informed. The former has a variety of hurrying notes, and &s;ings all night. Some part of the &s;ong of the former, I &s;u&s;pect, is attributed to the latter. We have plenty of the &s;oft-billed &s;ort; which Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> had entirely left out of his <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology,</HI> till I reminded him of his omi&s;&s;ion. See <HI>Briti&s;h Zoology</HI> la&s;t publi&s;hed, p. 16<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See letter xxv. to Mr. <HI>Pennant.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have &s;omewhat to advance on the different manners in which different birds fly and walk; but as this is a &s;ubject that I have not enough con&s;idered, and is of &s;uch a nature as not to be contained in a &s;mall &s;pace, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing further about it at pre&s;ent<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See letter xlii. to Mr. <HI>Barrington.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>No doubt the rea&s;on why the &s;ex of birds in their fir&s;t plumage is &s;o difficult to be di&s;tingui&s;hed is, as you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"becau&s;e they are not to pair and di&s;charge their parental functions till the en&s;uing &s;pring."</Q> As colours &s;eem to be the chief external &s;exual di&s;tinction in many birds, the&s;e colours do not take place till &s;exual attachments begin to obtain.

<P>I AM glad to hear that <HI>Kuckalm</HI> is to furni&s;h you with the birds of <HI>Jamaica;</HI> a &s;ight of the <HI>hirundines</HI> of that hot and di&s;tant i&s;land would be a great entertainment to me.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anni of Scopoli</HI> are now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and I have read the <HI>Annus Primus</HI> with &s;atisfaction: for though &s;ome parts of this work are exceptionable, and he may advance &s;ome mi&s;taken ob&s;ervations; yet the ornithology of &s;o di&s;tant a country as <HI>Carniola</HI> is very curious. Men that undertake only one di&s;trict are much more likely to advance natural knowledge than tho&s;e that gra&s;p at more than they can po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted with: every kingdom, every province, &s;hould have it's own <HI>monographer.</HI></P>
<P>The rea&s;on perhaps why he mentions nothing of <HI>Ray</HI>'s Ornitho|logy may be the extreme poverty and di&s;tance of his country, into which the works of our great naturali&s;t may have never yet found their way. You have doubts, I know, whether this Ornithology is genuine, and really the work of <HI>Scopoli:</HI> as to my&s;elf, I think I di&s;cover &s;trong tokens of authenticity; the &s;tyle corre&s;ponds with that of his <HI>Entomology;</HI> and his characters of his Ordines and Genera are many of them new, expre&s;&s;ive, and ma&s;terly. He has ventured to alter &s;ome of the <HI>Linnaean genera</HI> with &s;ufficient &s;hew of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>It might perhaps be mere accident that you &s;aw &s;o many &s;wifts and no &s;wallows at <HI>Staines;</HI> becau&s;e, in my long ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="133" REF="142">
tho&s;e birds, I never could di&s;cover the lea&s;t degree of rivalry or ho&s;tility between the &s;pecies.</P>

As far as I can ob&s;erve, many birds that du&s;t them&s;elves never wa&s;h: and I once thought that tho&s;e birds that wa&s;h them&s;elves would never du&s;t; but here I find my&s;elf mi&s;taken; for common hou&s;e-&s;parrows are great <HI>pulveratrices,</HI> being frequently &s;een grovelling and wallowing in du&s;ty roads; and yet they are great wa&s;hers. Does not the &s;kylark du&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> Might not <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his followers take one method of purification from the&s;e <HI>pulveratrices?</HI> becau&s;e I find from travel|lers of credit, that if a &s;trict mu&s;&s;ulman is journeying in a &s;andy de&s;ert where no water is to be found, at &s;tated hours he &s;trips off his clothes, and mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly rubs his body over with &s;and or du&s;t.</P>
<P>A countryman told me he had found a young <HI>fern-owl</HI> in the ne&s;t of a &s;mall bird on the ground; and that it was fed by the little bird. I went to &s;ee this extraordinary phenomenon, and found that it was a young cuckoo hatched in the ne&s;t of a titlark: it was become va&s;tly too big for it's ne&s;t, appearing

and was very fierce and pugnacious, pur&s;uing my finger, as I teazed it, for many feet from the ne&s;t, and &s;parring and buffetting with it's wings like a game-cock.

<P>THE birds that I took for <HI>aberdavines</HI> were reed-&s;parrows <HI>(pa&s;&s;eres torquati.)</HI></P>
<P>There are doubtle&s;s many home internal migrations within this kingdom that want to be better under&s;tood: witne&s;s tho&s;e va&s;t &s;locks of hen chaffinches that appear with us in the winter without hardly any cocks among them. Now was there a due proportion
<PB N="136" REF="145">
of each &s;ex, it &s;hould &s;eem very improbable that any one di&s;trict &s;hould produce &s;uch numbers of the&s;e little birds; and much more when only one half of the &s;pecies appears: therefore we may con|clude that the <HI>fringillae caelebes,</HI> for &s;ome good purpo&s;es, have a peculiar migration of their own in which the &s;exes part. Nor &s;hould it &s;eem &s;o wonderful that the intercour&s;e of &s;exes in this &s;pecies of birds &s;hould be interrupted in winter; &s;ince in many animals, and particularly in bucks and does, the &s;exes herd &s;eparately, except at the &s;ea&s;on when commerce is nece&s;&s;ary for the continuance of the breed. For this matter of the chaffinches &s;ee <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> p. 85, and <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> p. 318. I &s;ee every winter va&s;t flights of hen chaffinches, but none of cocks.</P>
<P>Your method of accounting for the periodical motions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;inging birds, or birds of flight, is a very probable one; &s;ince the matter of food is a great regulator of the actions and pro|ceedings of the brute creation: there is but one that can be &s;et in competition with it, and that is love. But I cannot quite acquie&s;ce with you in one circum&s;tance when you advance that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when they have thus fea&s;ted, they again &s;eparate into &s;mall parties of five or &s;ix, and get the be&s;t fare they can within a certain di&s;trict, having no inducement to go in que&s;t of fre&s;h-turned earth."</Q> Now if you mean that the bu&s;ine&s;s of congregating is quite at an end from the conclu&s;ion of wheat-&s;owing to the &s;ea&s;on of barley and oats, it is not the ca&s;e with us; for larks and chaffinches, and particularly linnets, flock and congregate as much in the very dead of winter as when the hu&s;bandman is bu&s;y with his ploughs and harrows.</P>
<P>Sure there can be no doubt but that woodcocks and fieldfares leave us in the &s;pring, in order to cro&s;s the &s;eas, and to retire to &s;ome di&s;tricts more &s;uitable to the purpo&s;e of breeding. That the
<PB N="137" REF="146">
former pair before they retire, and that the hens are forward with egg, I my&s;elf, when I was a &s;port&s;man, have often experienced. It cannot indeed be denied but that now and then we hear of a woodcock's ne&s;t, or young birds, di&s;covered in &s;ome part or other of this i&s;land: but then they are always mentioned as rarities, and &s;omewhat out of the common cour&s;e of things: but as to redwings and fieldfares, no &s;port&s;man or naturali&s;t has ever yet, that I could hear, pretended to have found the ne&s;t or young of tho&s;e &s;pecies in any part of the&s;e kingdoms. And I the more admire at this in|&s;tance as extraordinary, &s;ince, to all appearance, the &s;ame food in &s;ummer as well as in winter might &s;upport them here which main|tains their congeners, the blackbirds and thru&s;hes, did they chu&s;e to &s;tay the &s;ummer through. From hence it appears that it is not food alone which determines &s;ome &s;pecies of birds with regard to their &s;tay or departure. Fieldfares and redwings di&s;appear &s;ooner or later according as the warm weather comes on earlier or later. For I well remember, after that dreadful winter 1739-40, that cold north-ea&s;t winds continued to blow on through <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> and that the&s;e kinds of birds (what few remained of them) did not de|part as u&s;ual, but were &s;een lingering about till the beginning of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t authority that we can have for the nidi&s;ication of the birds above mentioned in any di&s;trict, is the te&s;timony of fauni&s;ts that have written profe&s;&s;edly the natural hi&s;tory of particular coun|tries. Now, as to the fieldfare, <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> in his Fauna Suecica, &s;ays of it that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>maximis in arboribus nidificat:</HI>"</Q> and of the redwing he &s;ays, in the &s;ame place, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>nidificat in mediis arbu&s;culis, &s;ive &s;epibus: ova &s;ex caeruleo-viridia maculis nigris variis.</HI>"</Q> Hence we may be a&s;&s;ured that fieldfares and redwings breed in <HI>Sweden. Scopoli</HI> &s;ays, in his <HI>Annus Primus,</HI> of the woodcock, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>nupta ad nos venit circa aequinoc|tium vernale:</HI>"</Q> meaning in <HI>Tirol,</HI> of which he is a native. And
<PB N="138" REF="147">
afterwards he adds <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>nidificat in paludibus alpinis: ova ponit</HI> 3&mdash;5."</Q> It does not appear from <HI>Kramer</HI> that woodcocks breed at all in <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> but he &s;ays <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Avis haec &s;eptentrionalium provinciarum a&s;tivo tempore incola e&s;t; ubi plerumque nidificat.

<P>YOU are, I know, no great friend to migration; and the well at|te&s;ted accounts from various parts of the kingdom &s;eem to ju&s;tify you in your &s;u&s;picions, that at lea&s;t many of the &s;wallow kind do
<PB N="139" REF="148">
not leave us in the winter, but lay them&s;elves up like in&s;ects and bats, in a torpid &s;tate, and &s;lumber away the more uncomfortable months till the return of the &s;un and fine weather awakens them.</P>
<P>But then we mu&s;t not, I think, deny migration in general; be|cau&s;e migration certainly does &s;ub&s;i&s;t in &s;ome places, as my brother in <HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> has fully informed me. Of the motions of the&s;e birds he has ocular demon&s;tration, for many weeks together, both &s;pring and fall: during which periods myriads of the &s;wallow kind traver&s;e the Straits from north to &s;outh, and from &s;outh to north, according to the &s;ea&s;on. And the&s;e va&s;t migrations con&s;i&s;t not only of <HI>hirundines</HI> but of <HI>bee-birds, hoopoes, oro pendolos, or golden thru&s;hes,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. and al&s;o of many of our <HI>&s;oft-billed &s;ummer birds of pa&s;&s;age;</HI> and moreover of birds which never leave us, &s;uch as all the various &s;orts of hawks and kites. Old <HI>Belon,</HI> two hundred years ago, gives a curious account of the incredible armies of hawks and kites which he &s;aw in the &s;pring-time traver&s;ing the <HI>Thracian Bo&s;phorus</HI> from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Europe.</HI> Be&s;ides the above mentioned, he remarks that the proce&s;|&s;ion is &s;welled by whole troops of eagles and vultures.</P>
<P>Now it is no wonder that birds re&s;iding in <HI>Africa</HI> &s;hould retreat before the &s;un as it advances, and retire to milder regions, and e&s;pecially birds of prey, who&s;e blood being heated with hot animal food, are more impatient of a &s;ultry climate: but then I cannot help wondering why kites and hawks, and &s;uch hardy birds as are known to defy all the &s;everity of <HI>England,</HI> and even of <HI>Sweden</HI> and all north <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;hould want to migrate from the &s;outh of <HI>Europe,</HI> and be di&s;&s;atisfied with the winters of <HI>Andalu&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>It does not appear to me that much &s;tre&s;s may be laid on the difficulty and hazard that birds mu&s;t run in their migrations, by rea|&s;on of va&s;t oceans, cro&s;s winds, &amp;c.; becau&s;e, if we reflect, a bird may travel from <HI>England</HI> to the equator without launching out and

expo&s;ing it&s;elf to boundle&s;s &s;eas, and that by cro&s;&s;ing the water at <HI>Dover,</HI> and again at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> And I with the more confidence advance this obvious remark, becau&s;e my brother has always found that &s;ome of his birds, and particularly the &s;wallow kind, are very &s;paring of their pains in cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> for when arrived at <HI>Gibraltar</HI> they do not<Q><L>&mdash; "Rang'd in figure wedge their way,</L>

They u&s;ually &s;lope acro&s;s the bay to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and &s;o pa&s;s over oppo&s;ite to <HI>Tangier,</HI> which, it &s;eems, is the narrowe&s;t &s;pace.</P>
<P>In former letters we have con&s;idered whether it was probable that woodcocks in moon-&s;hiny nights cro&s;s the <HI>German</HI> ocean from <HI>Scandinavia.</HI> As a proof that birds of le&s;s &s;peed may pa&s;s that &s;ea, con&s;iderable as it is, I &s;hall relate the following incident, which, though mentioned to have happened &s;o many years ago, was &s;trictly matter of fact:&mdash;As &s;ome people were &s;hooting in the pari&s;h of <HI>Trotton,</HI> in the county of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> they killed a duck in that dreadful winter 1708-9, with a &s;ilver collar about it's neck<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I have read a like anecdote of a &s;wan.</NOTE>, on which were engraven the arms of the king of <HI>Denmark.</HI> This anecdote the rector of <HI>Trotton</HI> at that time has often told to a near relation of mine; and, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, the collar was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the rector.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="150">
At pre&s;ent I do not know any body near the &s;ea-&s;ide that will take the trouble to remark at what time of the moon woodcocks fir&s;t come: if I lived near the &s;ea my&s;elf I would &s;oon tell you more of the matter. One thing I u&s;ed to ob&s;erve when I was a &s;port&s;man, that there were times in which woodcocks were &s;o &s;luggi&s;h and &s;leepy that they would drop again when flu&s;hed ju&s;t before the &s;paniels, nay ju&s;t at the muzzle of a gun that had been fired at them: whether this &s;trange lazine&s;s was the effect of a recent fatiguing journey I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to &s;ay.</P>

<P>Let me hear from your own ob&s;ervation whether &s;kylarks do not du&s;t. I think they do: and if they do, whether they wa&s;h al&s;o.</P>

<P>FROM what follows, it will appear that neither owls nor cuckoos keep to one note. A friend remarks that many (mo&s;t) of his owls hoot in B flat; but that one went almo&s;t half a note below A. The pipe he tried their notes by was a common half-crown pitch-pipe, &s;uch as ma&s;ters u&s;e for tuning of harp&s;ichords; it was the common <HI>London</HI> pitch.</P>
<P>A neighbour of mine, who is &s;aid to have a nice ear, remarks that the owls about this village hoot in three different keys, in G flat, or F &s;harp, in B flat and A flat. He heard two hooting to each other, the one in A flat, and the other in B flat. <HI>Query:</HI> Do the&s;e different notes proceed from different &s;pecies, or only from various individuals? The &s;ame per&s;on finds upon trial that the note of the cuckoo (of which we have but one &s;pecies) varies in different individuals; for, about <HI>Selborne</HI> wood, he found they were mo&s;tly in D: he heard two &s;ing together, the one in D, the other in D &s;harp, who made a di&s;agreeable concert: he afterwards heard one in D &s;harp, and about <HI>Woolmer-fore&s;t</HI> &s;ome in C. As to night|ingales, he &s;ays that their notes are &s;o &s;hort, and their tran&s;itions &s;o rapid, that he cannot well a&s;certain their key. Perhaps in a cage, and in a room, their notes may be more di&s;tingui&s;hable. This per|&s;on has tried to &s;ettle the notes of a &s;wift, and of &s;everal other &s;mall birds, but cannot bring them to any criterion.</P>

As I have often remarked that redwings are &s;ome of the fir&s;t birds that &s;uffer with us in &s;evere weather, it is no wonder at all that they retreat from <HI>Scandinavian</HI> winters: and much more the <HI>ordo</HI> of <HI>grallae,</HI> who, all to a bird, for&s;ake the northern parts of <HI>Europe</HI> at the approach of winter. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Grallae tanquam conjuratae unanimiter in fugam &s;e conjiciunt; ne earum unicam quidem inter nos habitantem in|venire po&s;&s;imus; ut enim ae&s;tate in au&s;tralibus degere nequeunt ob defectum lumbricorum, terramque &s;iccam; ita nec in frigidis ob eandem cau&s;am</HI>",</Q> &s;ays <HI>Ekmarck</HI> the <HI>Swede,</HI> in his ingenious little treati&s;e called <HI>Migra|tiones Avium,</HI> which by all means you ought to read while your thoughts run on the &s;ubject of migration.

<P>Foreign &s;y&s;tematics are, I ob&s;erve, much too vague in their &s;pecific differences; which are almo&s;t univer&s;ally con&s;tituted by one or two particular marks, the re&s;t of the de&s;cription running in general terms. But our countryman, the excellent Mr. <HI>Ray,</HI> is

<P>WHEN I ride about in the winter, and &s;ee &s;uch prodigious flocks of various kinds of birds, I cannot help admiring at the&s;e congre|gations, and wi&s;hing that it was in my power to account for tho&s;e appearances almo&s;t peculiar to the &s;ea&s;on. The two great motives which regulate the proceedings of the brute creation are love and hunger; the former incites animals to perpetuate their kind, the
<PB N="146" REF="155">
latter induces them to pre&s;erve individuals: whether either of the&s;e &s;hould &s;eem to be the ruling pa&s;&s;ion in the matter of congregating is to be con&s;idered. As to love, that is out of the que&s;tion at a time of the year when that &s;oft pa&s;&s;ion is not indulged: be&s;ides, during the amorous &s;ea&s;on, &s;uch a jealou&s;y prevails between the male birds that they can hardly bear to be together in the &s;ame hedge or field. Mo&s;t of the &s;inging and elation of &s;pirits of that time &s;eem to me to be the effect of rivalry and emulation: and it is to this &s;pirit of jealou&s;y that I chiefly attribute the equal di&s;per&s;ion of birds in the &s;pring over the face of the country.</P>
<P>Now as to the bu&s;ine&s;s of food: as the&s;e animals are actuated by in&s;tinct to hunt for nece&s;&s;ary food, they &s;hould not, one would &s;up|po&s;e, crowd together in pur&s;uit of &s;u&s;tenance at a time when it is mo&s;t likely to fail; yet &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations do take place in hard weather chiefly, and thicken as the &s;everity increa&s;es. As &s;ome kind of &s;elf-intere&s;t and &s;elf-defence is no doubt the motive for the proceeding, may it not ari&s;e from the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of their &s;tate in &s;uch rigorous &s;ea&s;ons; as men crowd together, when under great calamities, though they know not why? Perhaps approximation may di&s;pel &s;ome de|gree of cold; and a crowd may make each individual appear &s;afer from the ravages of birds of prey and other dangers.</P>
<P>If I admire when I &s;ee how much congenerous birds love to con|gregate, I am the more &s;truck when I &s;ee incongruous ones in &s;uch &s;trict amity. If we do not much wonder to &s;ee a flock of rooks u&s;ually attended by a train of daws, yet it is &s;trange that the former &s;hould &s;o frequently have a flight of &s;tarlings for their &s;atellites. Is it becau&s;e rooks have a more di&s;cerning &s;cent than their attend|dants, and can lead them to &s;pots more productive of food? Anato|mi&s;ts &s;ay that rooks, by rea&s;on of two large nerves which run down between the eyes into the upper mandible, have a more delicate feeling in their beaks than other round-billed birds, and can grope

for their meat when out of &s;ight. Perhaps then their a&s;&s;ociates attend them on the motive of intere&s;t, as greyhounds wait on the motions of their finders; and as lions are &s;aid to do on the yelpings of jackalls. Lapwings and &s;tarlings &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ociate.</P>

<P>AS a gentleman and my&s;elf were walking on the fourth of la&s;t <HI>November</HI> round the &s;ea-banks at <HI>Newhaven,</HI> near the mouth of the <HI>Lewes</HI> river, in pur&s;uit of natural knowledge, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee three hou&s;e-&s;wallows gliding very &s;wiftly by us.

From this incident, and from repeated accounts which I meet with, I am more and more induced to believe that many of the &s;wallow kind do not depart from this i&s;land; but lay them&s;elves up in holes and caverns; and do, in&s;ect-like and bat-like, come forth at mild times, and then retire again to their <HI>latebrae.</HI> Nor make I the lea&s;t doubt but that, if I lived at <HI>Newhaven, Sea|ford, Brighthelm&s;tone,</HI> or any of tho&s;e towns near the chalk-cliffs of the <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> coa&s;t, by proper ob&s;ervations, I &s;hould &s;ee &s;wallows &s;tir|ring at periods of the winter, when the noons were &s;oft and inviting, and the &s;un warm and invigorating.

<P>WHILE I was in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> la&s;t autumn my re&s;idence was at the village near <HI>Lewes,</HI> from whence I had formerly the plea&s;ure of writing to you. On the fir&s;t of <HI>November</HI> I remarked that the old tortoi&s;e, formerly mentioned, began fir&s;t to dig the ground in order to the forming it's hybernaculum, which it had fixed on ju&s;t be&s;ide a great tuft of hepaticas. It &s;crapes out the ground with it's fore-feet, and throws it up over it's back with it's hind; but the motion of it's legs is ridiculou&s;ly &s;low, little exceeding the hour-hand of a clock; and &s;uitable to the compo&s;ure of an animal &s;aid to be a whole month in performing one feat of copulation. Nothing can be more a&s;&s;iduous than this creature night and day in &s;cooping the earth, and forcing it's great body into the cavity; but, as the noons of that &s;ea&s;on proved unu&s;ually warm and &s;unny, it was continually interrupted, and called forth by the heat in the middle of the day;
<PB N="149" REF="158">
and though I continued there till the thirteenth of <HI>November,</HI> yet the work remained unfini&s;hed. Har&s;her weather, and fro&s;ty mornings, would have quickened it's operations. No part of it's behaviour ever &s;truck me more than the extreme timidity it always expre&s;&s;es with regard to rain; for though it has a &s;hell that would &s;ecure it again&s;t the wheel of a loaded cart, yet does it di&s;cover as much &s;olicitude about rain as a lady dre&s;&s;ed in all her be&s;t attire, &s;huffling away on the fir&s;t &s;prinklings, and running it's head up in a corner. If attended to, it becomes an excellent weather-gla&s;s; for as &s;ure as it walks elate, and as it were on tiptoe, feeding with great earne&s;tne&s;s in a morning, &s;o &s;ure will it rain before night. It is totally a diurnal animal, and never pretends to &s;tir after it be|comes dark. The tortoi&s;e, like other reptiles, has an arbitrary &s;tomach as well as lungs; and can refrain from eating as well as breathing for a great part of the year. When fir&s;t awakened it eats nothing; nor again in the autumn before it retires: through the height of the &s;ummer it feeds voraciou&s;ly, devouring all the food that comes in it's way. I was much taken with it's &s;agacity in di&s;|cerning tho&s;e that do it kind offices: for, as &s;oon as the good old lady comes in &s;ight who has waited on it for more than thirty years, it hobbles towards it's benefactre&s;s with aukward alacrity; but re|mains inattentive to &s;trangers.

<P>THE more I reflect on the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of animals, the more I am a&s;to|ni&s;hed at it's effects. Nor is the violence of this affection more wonderful than the &s;hortne&s;s of it's duration. Thus every hen is in her turn the virago of the yard, in proportion to the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of her brood; and will fly in the face of a dog or a &s;ow in defence of tho&s;e chickens, which in a few weeks &s;he will drive before her with relentle&s;s cruelty.</P>
<P>This affection &s;ublimes the pa&s;&s;ions, quickens the invention, and &s;harpens the &s;agacity of the brute creation. Thus an hen, ju&s;t be|come a mother, is no longer that placid bird &s;he u&s;ed to be, but with feathers &s;tanding an end, wings hovering, and clocking note, &s;he runs about like one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Dams will throw them&s;elves in the way of the greate&s;t danger in order to avert it from their pro|geny. Thus a partridge will tumble along before a &s;port&s;man in order to draw away the dogs from her helple&s;s covey. In the time of nidification the mo&s;t feeble birds will a&s;&s;ault the mo&s;t rapacious. All the hirundines of a village are up in arms at the &s;ight of an hawk, whom they will per&s;ecute till he leaves that di&s;trict. A very exact ob&s;erver has often remarked that a pair of ravens ne&s;ting in the rock of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> would &s;uffer no vulture or eagle to re&s;t near their &s;tation, but would drive them from the hill with an amazing fury: even the
<PB N="151" REF="160">
blue thru&s;h at the &s;ea&s;on of breeding would dart out from the clefts of the rocks to cha&s;e away the ke&s;tril, or the &s;parrow-hawk. If you &s;tand near the ne&s;t of a bird that has young, &s;he will not be induced to betray them by an inadvertent fondne&s;s, but will wait about at a di&s;tance with meat in her mouth for an hour together.</P>
<P>Should I farther corroborate what I have advanced above by &s;ome anecdotes which I probably may have mentioned before in conver&s;ation, yet you will, I tru&s;t, pardon the repetition for the &s;ake of the illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>The flycatcher of the Zoology (the <HI>&s;toparola</HI> of <HI>Ray</HI>), builds every year in the vines that grow on the walls of my hou&s;e. A pair of the&s;e little birds had one year inadvertently placed their ne&s;t on a naked bough, perhaps in a &s;hady time, not being aware of the inconvenience that followed. But an hot &s;unny &s;ea&s;on coming on before the brood was half fledged, the reflection of the wall became in&s;upportable, and mu&s;t inevitably have de&s;troyed the tender young, had not affection &s;ugge&s;ted an expedient, and prompted the parent-birds to hover over the ne&s;t all the hotter hours, while with wings expanded, and mouths gaping for breath, they &s;creened off the heat from their &s;uffering offspring.</P>
<P>A farther in&s;tance I once &s;aw of notable &s;agacity in a willow-wren, which had built in a bank in my fields. This bird a friend and my&s;elf had ob&s;erved as &s;he &s;at in her ne&s;t; but were particularly careful not to di&s;turb her, though we &s;aw &s;he eyed us with &s;ome degree of jealou&s;y. Some days after as we pa&s;&s;ed that way we were de&s;irous of remarking how this brood went on; but no ne&s;t could be found, till I happened to take up a large bundle of long green mo&s;s, as it were, carele&s;&s;ly thrown over the ne&s;t in order to dodge the eye of any impertinent intruder.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="161">
A &s;till more remarkable mixture of &s;agacity and in&s;tinct occurred to me one day as my people were pulling off the lining of an hotbed, in order to add &s;ome fre&s;h dung. From out of the &s;ide of this bed leaped an animal with great agility that made a mo&s;t grote&s;que figure; nor was it without great difficulty that it could be taken; when it proved to be a large white-bellied field-mou&s;e with three or four young clinging to her teats by their mouths and feet. It was amazing that the de&s;ultory and rapid motions of this dam &s;hould not oblige her litter to quit their hold, e&s;pecially when it appeared that they were &s;o young as to be both naked and blind!</P>
<P>To the&s;e in&s;tances of tender attachment, many more of which might be daily di&s;covered by tho&s;e that are &s;tudious of nature, may be oppo&s;ed that rage of affection, that mon&s;trous perver&s;ion of the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> which induces &s;ome females of the brute creation to devour their young becau&s;e their owners have handled them too freely, or removed them from place to place! Swine, and &s;ometimes the more gentle race of dogs and cats, are guilty of this horrid and prepo&s;terous murder. When I hear now and then of an abandoned mother that de&s;troys her offspring, I am not &s;o much amazed; &s;ince rea&s;on per|verted, and the bad pa&s;&s;ions let loo&s;e, are capable of any enormity: but why the parental feelings of brutes, that u&s;ually flow in one mo&s;t uniform tenor, &s;hould &s;ometimes be &s;o extravagantly diverted, I leave to abler philo&s;ophers than my&s;elf to determine.</P>

<P>SOME young men went down lately to a pond on the verge of <HI>Wolmer-fore&s;t</HI> to hunt flappers, or young wild-ducks, many of which they caught, and, among the re&s;t, &s;ome very minute yet well-fledged wild-fowls alive, which upon examination I found to be teals. I did not know till then that teals ever bred in the &s;outh of <HI>England,</HI> and was much plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery: this I look upon as a great &s;troke in natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>We have had, ever &s;ince I can remember, a pair of white owls that con&s;tantly breed under the eaves of this church. As I have paid good attention to the manner of life of the&s;e birds during their &s;ea&s;on of breeding, which la&s;ts the &s;ummer through, the following remarks may not perhaps be unacceptable:&mdash;About an hour before &s;un&s;et (for then the mice begin to run) they &s;ally forth in que&s;t of prey, and hunt all round the hedges of meadows and &s;mall enclo&s;ures for them, which &s;eem to be their only food. In this irregular country we can &s;tand on an eminence and &s;ee them beat the fields over like a &s;etting-dog, and often drop down in the gra&s;s or corn. I have minuted the&s;e birds with my watch for an hour together, and have found that they return to their ne&s;t, the one or the other of them, about once in five minutes; reflecting at the &s;ame time on the adroitne&s;s that every animal is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as far as regards the well being of it&s;elf and off|&s;pring.
<PB N="154" REF="163">
But a piece of addre&s;s, which they &s;hew when they re|turn loaded, &s;hould not, I think, be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.&mdash;As they take their prey with their claws, &s;o they carry it in their claws to their ne&s;t: but, as the feet are nece&s;&s;ary in their a&s;cent under the tiles, they con&s;tantly perch fir&s;t on the roof of the chancel, and &s;hift the mou&s;e from their claws to their bill, that the feet may be at liberty to take hold of the plate on the wall as they are ri&s;ing under the eaves.</P>
<P>White owls &s;eem not (but in this I am not po&s;itive) to hoot at all: all that clamorous hooting appears to me to come from the wood kinds. The white owl does indeed &s;nore and hi&s;s in a tre|mendous manner; and the&s;e menaces well an&s;wer the intention of intimidating: for I have known a whole village up in arms on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, imagining the church-yard to be full of goblins and &s;pectres. White owls al&s;o often &s;cream horribly as they fly along; from this &s;creaming probably aro&s;e the common people's imaginary &s;pecies of <HI>&s;creech-owl,</HI> which they &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly think attends the windows of dying per&s;ons. The plumage of the remiges of the wings of every &s;pecies of owl that I have yet examined is remarkably &s;oft and pliant. Perhaps it may be nece&s;&s;ary that the wings of the&s;e birds &s;hould not make much re&s;i&s;tance or ru&s;hing, that they may be enabled to &s;teal through the air unheard upon a nimble and watchful quarry.</P>
<P>While I am talking of owls, it may not be improper to mention what I was told by a gentleman of the county of <HI>Wilts.</HI> As they were grubbing a va&s;t hollow pollard-a&s;h that had been the man&s;ion of owls for centuries, he di&s;covered at the bottom a ma&s;s of matter that at fir&s;t he could not account for. After &s;ome exa|mination, he found that it was a congeries of the bones of mice (and perhaps of birds and bats) that had been heaping together
<PB N="155" REF="164">
for ages, being ca&s;t up in pellets out of the crops of many genera|tions of inhabitants. For owls ca&s;t up the bones, fur, and feathers, of what they devour, after the manner of hawks. He believes, he told me, that there were bu&s;hels of this kind of &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>When brown owls hoot their throats &s;well as big as an hen's egg. I have known an owl of this &s;pecies live a full year without any water. Perhaps the ca&s;e may be the &s;ame with all birds of prey. When owls fly they &s;tretch out their legs behind them as a balance to their large heavy heads, for as mo&s;t nocturnal birds have large eyes and ears they mu&s;t have large heads to contain them. Large eyes I pre&s;ume are nece&s;&s;ary to collect every ray of light, and large concave ears to command the &s;malle&s;t degree of &s;ound or noi&s;e.</P>

<P>A <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of them is familiar to hor&s;emen in the &s;outh of <HI>England</HI> under the name of <HI>fore&s;t-fly;</HI> and to &s;ome of <HI>&s;ide-fly,</HI> from it's run|ing &s;ideways like a crab.

<P>IN obedience to your injunctions I &s;it down to give you &s;ome ac|count of the hou&s;e-martin, or martlet; and, if my monography of this little dome&s;tic and familiar bird &s;hould happen to meet with your approbation, I may probably &s;oon extend my inquiries to the re&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines</HI>&mdash;the &s;wallow, the &s;wift, and the bank|martin.</P>
<P>A few hou&s;e-martins begin to appear about the &s;ixteenth of <HI>April;</HI> u&s;ually &s;ome few days later than the &s;wallow. For &s;ome time after they appear the hirundines in general pay no attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s of nidification, but play and &s;port about, either to recruit from the fatigue of their journey, if they do migrate at all, or el&s;e that their blood may recover it's true tone and texture after it has been &s;o long benumbed by the &s;everities of winter. About the middle of <HI>May,</HI> if the weather be fine, the martin begins to think in earne&s;t of providing a man&s;ion for it's family. The cru&s;t or &s;hell of this ne&s;t &s;eems to be formed of &s;uch dirt or loam as comes mo&s;t readily to hand, and is tempered and wrought together with little bits of broken &s;traws to render it tough and tenacious. As this bird often builds again&s;t a perpendicular wall without any pro|jecting ledge under, it requires it's utmo&s;t efforts to get the fir&s;t foundation firmly fixed, &s;o that it may &s;afely carry the &s;uper&s;truc|ture. On this occa&s;ion the bird not only clings with it's claws,
<PB N="158" REF="167">
but partly &s;upports it&s;elf by &s;trongly inclining it's tail again&s;t the wall, making that a fulcrum; and thus &s;teadied it works and pla&s;ters the materials into the face of the brick or &s;tone. But then, that this work may not, while it is &s;oft and green, pull it&s;elf down by it's own weight, the provident architect has prudence and for|bearance enough not to advance her work too fa&s;t; but by building only in the morning, and by dedicating the re&s;t of the day to food and amu&s;ement, gives it &s;ufficient time to dry and harden. About half an inch &s;eems to be a &s;ufficient layer for a day. Thus careful workmen when they build mud-walls (informed at fir&s;t perhaps by this little bird) rai&s;e but a moderate layer at a time, and then de&s;i&s;t; le&s;t the work &s;hould become top-heavy, and &s;o be ruined by it's own weight. By this method in about ten or twelve days is formed an hemi&s;pheric ne&s;t with a &s;mall aperture towards the top, &s;trong, compact, and warm; and perfectly fitted for all the purpo&s;es for which it was intended. But then nothing is more common than for the hou&s;e-&s;parrow, as &s;oon as the &s;hell is fini&s;hed, to &s;eize on it as it's own, to eject the owner, and to line it after it's own manner.</P>
<P>After &s;o much labour is be&s;towed in erecting a man&s;ion, as Nature &s;eldom works in vain, martins will breed on for &s;everal years together in the &s;ame ne&s;t, where it happens to be well &s;helter|ed and &s;ecure from the injuries of weather. The &s;hell or cru&s;t of the ne&s;t is a &s;ort of ru&s;tic-work full of knobs and protuberances on the out&s;ide: nor is the in&s;ide of tho&s;e that I have examined &s;moothed with any exactne&s;s at all; but is rendered &s;oft and warm, and fit for incubation, by a lining of &s;mall &s;traws, gra&s;&s;es, and fea|thers; and &s;ometimes by a bed of mo&s;s interwoven with wool. In this ne&s;t they tread, or engender, frequently during the time of building; and the hen lays from three to five white eggs.</P>

At fir&s;t when the young are hatched, and are in a naked and helple&s;s condition, the parent birds, with tender a&s;&s;iduity, carry out what comes away from their young. Was it not for this affec|tionate cleanline&s;s the ne&s;tlings would &s;oon be burnt up, and de|&s;troyed in &s;o deep and hollow a ne&s;t, by their own cau&s;tic excrement. In the quadruped creation the &s;ame neat precaution is made u&s;e of; particularly among dogs and cats, where the dams lick away what proceeds from their young. But in birds there &s;eems to be a particular provi&s;ion, that the dung of ne&s;tlings is enveloped in a tough kind of jelly, and therefore is the ea&s;ier conveyed off without &s;oiling or daubing. Yet, as nature is cleanly in all her ways, the young perform this office for them&s;elves in a little time by thru&s;t|ing their tails out at the aperture of their ne&s;t. As the young of &s;mall birds pre&s;ently arrive at their <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or full growth, they &s;oon become impatient of confinement, and &s;it all day with their heads out at the orifice, where the dams, by clinging to the ne&s;t, &s;upply them with food from morning to night. For a time the young are fed on the wing by their parents; but the feat is done by &s;o quick and almo&s;t imperceptible a &s;light, that a per&s;on mu&s;t have attended very exactly to their motions before he would be able to perceive it. As &s;oon as the young are able to &s;hift for them&s;elves, the dams immediately turn their thoughts to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;econd brood: while the fir&s;t flight, &s;haken off and rejected by their nur&s;es, congregate in great flocks, and are the birds that are &s;een clu&s;tering and hovering on &s;unny mornings and evenings round towers and &s;teeples, and on the roofs of churches and hou&s;es. The&s;e congregatings u&s;ually begin to take place about the fir&s;t week in <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and therefore we may conclude that by that time the fir&s;t flight is pretty well over. The young of this &s;pecies do not quit their abodes all together; but the more forward birds get abroad &s;ome days

before the re&s;t. The&s;e approaching the eaves of buildings, and play|ing about before them, make people think that &s;everal old ones attend one ne&s;t. They are often capricious in fixing on a ne&s;ting|place, beginning many edifices, and leaving them unfini&s;hed; but when once a ne&s;t is completed in a &s;heltered place, it &s;erves for &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons. Tho&s;e which breed in a ready fini&s;hed hou&s;e get the &s;tart in hatching of tho&s;e that build new by ten days or a fortnight. The&s;e indu&s;trious artificers are at their labours in the long days be|fore four in the morning: when they fix their materials they pla&s;ter them on with their chins, moving their heads with a quick vibratory motion. They dip and wa&s;h as they fly &s;ometimes in very hot weather, but not &s;o frequently as &s;wallows. It has been ob&s;erved that martins u&s;ually build to a north-ea&s;t or north-we&s;t a&s;pect, that the heat of the &s;un may not crack and de&s;troy their ne&s;ts: but in|&s;tances are al&s;o remembered where they bred for many years in va&s;t abundance in an hot &s;tifled inn-yard, again&s;t a wall facing to the &s;outh.</P>
<P>Birds in general are wi&s;e in their choice of &s;ituation: but in this neighbourhood every &s;ummer is &s;een a &s;trong proof to the contrary at an hou&s;e without eaves in an expo&s;ed di&s;trict, where &s;ome mar|tins build year by year in the corners of the windows. But, as the corners of the&s;e windows (which face to the &s;outh-ea&s;t and &s;outh-we&s;t) are too &s;hallow, the ne&s;ts are wa&s;hed down every hard rain; and yet the&s;e birds drudge on to no purpo&s;e from &s;ummer to &s;ummer, without changing their a&s;pect or hou&s;e. It is a piteous &s;ight to &s;ee them labouring when half their ne&s;t is wa&s;hed away and bringing dirt&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"<HI>generis lap&s;i &s;arcire ruinas.</HI>"</Q> Thus is in&s;tinct a mo&s;t wonderful unequal faculty; in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;o much above rea&s;on, in other re&s;pects &s;o far below it! Martins love to frequent towns, e&s;pecially if there are great lakes and rivers at hand; nay
<PB N="161" REF="170">
they even affect the clo&s;e air of <HI>London.</HI> And I have not only &s;een them ne&s;ting in the <HI>Borough,</HI> but even in the <HI>Strand</HI> and <HI>Fleet-&s;treet;</HI> but then it was obvious from the dingine&s;s of their a&s;pect that their feathers partook of the filth of that &s;ooty atmo&s;phere. Martins are by far the lea&s;t agile of the four &s;pecies; their wings and tails are &s;hort, and therefore they are not capable of &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing turns and quick and glancing evolutions as the &s;wallow. Accord|ingly they make u&s;e of a placid ea&s;y motion in a middle region of the air, &s;eldom mounting to any great height, and never &s;weeping long together over the &s;urface of the ground or water. They do not wander far for food, but affect &s;heltered di&s;tricts, over &s;ome lake, or under &s;ome hanging wood, or in &s;ome hollow vale, e&s;pecially in windy weather. They breed the late&s;t of all the &s;wallow kind: in 1772 they had ne&s;tlings on to <HI>October</HI> the twenty-fir&s;t, and are never without unfledged young as late as <HI>Michaelmas.</HI></P>
<P>As the &s;ummer declines the congregating flocks increa&s;e in num|bers daily by the con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ion of the &s;econd broods; till at la&s;t they &s;warm in myriads upon myriads round the villages on the <HI>Thames,</HI> darkening the face of the &s;ky as they frequent the aits of that river, where they roo&s;t. They retire, the bulk of them I mean, in va&s;t flocks together about the beginning of <HI>October:</HI> but have appeared of late years in a con&s;iderable flight in this neighbour|hood, for one day or two, as late as <HI>November</HI> the third and &s;ixth, after they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been gone for more than a fort|night. They therefore withdraw with us the late&s;t of any &s;pecies. Unle&s;s the&s;e birds are very &s;hort-lived indeed, or unle&s;s they do not return to the di&s;trict where they are bred, they mu&s;t undergo va&s;t deva&s;tations &s;ome how, and &s;ome where; for the birds that return yearly bear no manner of proportion to the birds that retire.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>RINGMER, near LEWES, <DATE>Dec. 9, 1773.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your la&s;t favour ju&s;t as I was &s;etting out for this place; and am plea&s;ed to find that my monography met with your appro|bation. My remarks are the re&s;ult of many years ob&s;ervation; and are, I tru&s;t, true in the whole: though I do not pretend to &s;ay that they are perfectly void of mi&s;take, or that a more nice ob&s;erver might not make many additions, &s;ince &s;ubjects of this kind are inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>If you think my letter worthy the notice of your re&s;pectable &s;ociety, you are at liberty to lay it before them; and they will con|&s;ider it, I hope, as it was intended, as an humble attempt to pro|mote a more minute inquiry into natural hi&s;tory; into the life and conver&s;ation of animals. Perhaps hereafter I may be induced to take the hou&s;e-&s;wallow under con&s;ideration; and from that pro|ceed to the re&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="172">
Though I have now travelled the <HI>Su&s;&s;ex-downs</HI> upwards of thirty years, yet I &s;till inve&s;tigate that chain of maje&s;tic mountains with fre&s;h admiration year by year; and think I &s;ee new beauties every time I traver&s;e it. This range, which runs from <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> ea&s;tward as far as <HI>Ea&s;t-Bourn,</HI> is about &s;ixty miles in length, and is called <HI>The South Downs,</HI> properly &s;peaking, only round <HI>Lewes.</HI> As you pa&s;s along you command a noble view of the wild, or weald, on one hand, and the broad downs and &s;ea on the other. Mr. <HI>Ray</HI> u&s;ed to vi&s;it a family<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Courthope</HI> of <HI>Danny.</HI></NOTE> ju&s;t at the foot of the&s;e hills, and was &s;o ravi&s;hed with the pro&s;pect from <HI>Plumpton-plain,</HI> near <HI>Lewes,</HI> that he mentions tho&s;e &s;capes in his "Wi&s;dom of God in the Works of the Creation" with the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction, and thinks them equal to any thing he had &s;een in the fine&s;t parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>For my own part, I think there is &s;omewhat peculiarly &s;weet and amu&s;ing in the &s;hapely figured a&s;pect of chalk-hills in preference to tho&s;e of &s;tone, which are rugged, broken, abrupt, and &s;hapele&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps I may be &s;ingular in my opinion, and not &s;o happy as to convey to you the &s;ame idea; but I never contemplate the&s;e mountains without thinking I perceive &s;omewhat analogous to growth in their gentle &s;wellings and &s;mooth fungus-like protuber|ances, their fluted &s;ides, and regular hollows and &s;lopes, that carry at once the air of vegetative dilation and expan&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Or was there ever a time when the&s;e immen&s;e ma&s;&s;es of calcarious matter were thrown into fermentation by &s;ome adventi|tious moi&s;ture; were rai&s;ed and leavened into &s;uch &s;hapes by &s;ome pla&s;tic power; and &s;o made to &s;well and heave their broad backs into the &s;ky &s;o much above the le&s;s animated clay of the wild below?</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="173">
By what I can gue&s;s from the admea&s;urements of the hills that have been taken round my hou&s;e, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e hills &s;urmount the wild at an average at about the rate of five hundred feet.</P>
<P>One thing is very remarkable as to the &s;heep: from the we&s;tward till you get to the river <HI>Adur</HI> all the flocks have horns, and &s;mooth white faces, and white legs; and a hornle&s;s &s;heep is rarely to be &s;een: but as &s;oon as you pa&s;s that river ea&s;tward, and mount <HI>Beeding-hill,</HI> all the flocks at once become hornle&s;s, or, as they call them, poll-&s;heep; and have moreover black faces with a white tuft of wool on their foreheads, and &s;peckled and &s;potted legs: &s;o that you would think that the flocks of <HI>Laban</HI> were pa&s;turing on one &s;ide of the &s;tream, and the variegated breed of his &s;on-in-law <HI>Jacob</HI> were cantoned along on the other. And this diver&s;ity holds good re&s;pectively on each &s;ide from the valley of <HI>Bramber</HI> and <HI>Beeding</HI> to the ea&s;tward, and we&s;tward all the whole length of the downs. If you talk with the &s;hepherds on this &s;ubject, they tell you that the ca&s;e has been &s;o from time immemorial; and &s;mile at your &s;implicity if you a&s;k them whether the &s;ituation of the&s;e two different breeds might not be rever&s;ed? However, an intelligent friend of mine near <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> is determined to try the experiment; and has this autumn, at the hazard of being laughed at, introduced a parcel of black-faced hornle&s;s rams among his horned we&s;tern ewes. The black-faced poll-&s;heep have the &s;horte&s;t legs and the fine&s;t wool.</P>
<P>As I had hardly ever before travelled the&s;e downs at &s;o late a &s;ea&s;on of the year, I was determined to keep as &s;harp a look-out as po&s;&s;ible &s;o near the &s;outhern coa&s;t, with re&s;pect to the &s;ummer &s;hort|winged birds of pa&s;&s;age. We make great inquiries concerning the withdrawing of the &s;wallow kind, without examining enough into
<PB N="165" REF="174">
the cau&s;es why <HI>this tribe</HI> is never to be &s;een in winter: for, <HI>entre nous,</HI> the di&s;appearing of the latter is more marvellous than that of the former, and much more unaccountable. The <HI>hirundines,</HI> if they plea&s;e, are certainly capable of migration; and yet no doubt are often found in a torpid &s;tate: but red&s;tarts, nightingales, white-throats, black-caps, &amp;c. &amp;c. are very ill provided for long flights; have never been once found, as I ever heard of, in a torpid &s;tate, and yet can never be &s;uppo&s;ed, in &s;uch troops, from year to year to dodge and elude the eyes of the curious and inqui&s;itive, which from day to day di&s;cern the other &s;mall birds that are known to abide our winters. But, notwith&s;tanding all my care, I &s;aw no|thing like a &s;ummer bird of pa&s;&s;age: and, what is more &s;trange, not one wheat-ear, though they abound &s;o in the autumn as to be a con&s;iderable perqui&s;ite to the &s;hepherds that take them; and though many are to be &s;een to my knowledge all the winter through in many parts of the &s;outh of <HI>England.</HI> The mo&s;t intelligent &s;hep|herds tell me that &s;ome few of the&s;e birds appear on the downs in <HI>March,</HI> and then withdraw to breed probably in warrens and &s;tone|quarries: now and then a ne&s;t is plowed up in a fallow on the downs under a furrow, but it is thought a rarity. At the time of wheat-har|ve&s;t they begin to be taken in great numbers; are &s;ent for &s;ale in va&s;t quantities to <HI>Brighthelm&s;tone</HI> and <HI>Tunbridge;</HI> and appear at the tables of all the gentry that entertain with any degree of elegance. About <HI>Michaelmas</HI> they retire and are &s;een no more till <HI>March.</HI> Though the&s;e birds are, when in &s;ea&s;on, in great plenty on the &s;outh downs round <HI>Lewes,</HI> yet at <HI>Ea&s;t-Bourn,</HI> which is the ea&s;tern extremity of tho&s;e downs, they abound much more. One thing is very remark|able&mdash;that though in the height of the &s;ea&s;on &s;o many hundreds of dozens are taken, yet they never are &s;een to &s;lock; and it is a rare thing to &s;ee more than three or four at a time: &s;o that there
<PB N="166" REF="175">
mu&s;t be a perpetual flitting and con&s;tant progre&s;&s;ive &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It does not appear that any wheat-ears are taken to the we&s;tward of <HI>Houghton-bridge,</HI> which &s;tands on the river <HI>Arun.</HI></P>
<P>I did not fail to look particularly after my new migration of <HI>ring-ou&s;els;</HI> and to take notice whether they continued on the downs to this &s;ea&s;on of the year; as I had formerly remarked them in the month of <HI>October</HI> all the way from <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Lewes</HI> where|ever there were any &s;hrubs and covert: but not one bird of this &s;ort came within my ob&s;ervation. I only &s;aw a few <HI>larks</HI> and <HI>whin|chats,</HI> &s;ome <HI>rooks,</HI> and &s;everal <HI>kites</HI> and <HI>buzzards.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> a flight of <HI>cro&s;s-bills</HI> comes to the pine-groves about this hou&s;e, but never makes any long &s;tay.</P>
<P>The old tortoi&s;e, that I have mentioned in a former letter, &s;till continues in this garden; and retired under ground about the twentieth of <HI>November,</HI> and came out again for one day on the thirtieth: it lies now buried in a wet &s;wampy border under a wall facing to the &s;outh, and is enveloped at pre&s;ent in mud and mire!</P>
<P>Here is a large rookery round this hou&s;e, the inhabitants of which &s;eem to get their livelihood very ea&s;ily; for they &s;pend the greate&s;t part of the day on their ne&s;t-trees when the weather is mild. The&s;e rooks retire every evening all the winter from this rookery, where they only call by the way, as they are going to roo&s;t in deep woods: at the dawn of day they always revi&s;it their ne&s;t-trees, and are preceded a few minutes by a flight of daws, that act, as it were, as their harbingers.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>SELBORNE, <DATE>Jan. 29, 1774.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE hou&s;e-&s;wallow, or chimney-&s;wallow, is undoubtedly the fir&s;t comer of all the <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines;</HI> and appears in general on or about the thirteenth of <HI>April,</HI> as I have remarked from many years ob&s;ervation. Not but now and then a &s;traggler is &s;een much earlier: and, in particular, when I was a boy I ob&s;erved a &s;wallow for a whole day together on a &s;unny warm <HI>Shrove Tue&s;day;</HI> which day could not fall out later than the middle of <HI>March,</HI> and often happened early in <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>It is worth remarking that the&s;e birds are &s;een fir&s;t about lakes and mill-ponds; and it is al&s;o very particular, that if the&s;e early vi&s;iters happen to find fro&s;t and &s;now, as was the ca&s;e of the two dreadful &s;prings of 1770 and 1771, they immediately withdraw for a time. A circum&s;tance this much more in favour of hiding than migration; &s;ince it is much more probable that a bird &s;hould retire to it's hybernaculum ju&s;t at hand, than return for a week or two only to warmer latitudes.</P>
<P>The &s;wallow, though called the chimney-&s;wallow, by no means builds altogether in chimnies, but often within barns and out|hou&s;es again&s;t the rafters; and &s;o &s;he did in <HI>Virgil</HI>'s time:
<Q><L>&mdash; "Ant&egrave;</L>
<L>"Garrula qu&agrave;m tignis nidos &s;u&s;pendat hirundo."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="177">
In <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;he builds in barns, and is called <HI>ladu &s;wala,</HI> the barn|&s;wallow. Be&s;ides, in the warmer parts of <HI>Europe</HI> there are no chim|nies to hou&s;es, except they are <HI>Engli&s;h-built:</HI> in the&s;e countries &s;he con&s;tructs her ne&s;t in porches, and gate-ways, and galleries, and open halls.</P>
<P>Here and there a bird may affect &s;ome odd, peculiar place; as we have known a &s;wallow build down the &s;haft of an old well, through which chalk had been formerly drawn up for the purpo&s;e of manure: but in general with us this <HI>hirundo</HI> breeds in chimnies; and loves to haunt tho&s;e &s;tacks where there is a con&s;tant fire, no doubt for the &s;ake of warmth. Not that it can &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the immediate &s;haft where there is a fire; but prefers one adjoining to that of the kitchen, and di&s;regards the perpetual &s;moke of that funnel, as I have often ob&s;erved with &s;ome degree of wonder.</P>
<P>Five or &s;ix or more feet down the chimney does this little bird begin to form her ne&s;t about the middle of <HI>May,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts, like that of the hou&s;e-martin, of a cru&s;t or &s;hell compo&s;ed of dirt or mud, mixed with &s;hort pieces of &s;traw to render it tough and permanent; with this difference, that whereas the &s;hell of the martin is nearly hemi&s;pheric, that of the &s;wallow is open at the top, and like half a deep di&s;h: this ne&s;t is lined with fine gra&s;&s;es, and feathers which are often collected as they float in the air.</P>
<P>Wonderful is the addre&s;s which this adroit bird &s;hews all day long in a&s;cending and de&s;cending with &s;ecurity through &s;o narrow a pa&s;s. When hovering over the mouth of the funnel, the vibra|tions of her wings acting on the confined air occa&s;ion a rumbling like thunder. It is not improbable that the dam &s;ubmits to this inconvenient &s;ituation &s;o low in the &s;haft, in order to &s;ecure her broods from rapacious birds, and particularly from owls, which
<PB N="169" REF="178">
frequently fall down chimnies, perhaps in attempting to get at the&s;e ne&s;tlings.</P>
<P>The &s;wallow lays from four to &s;ix white eggs, dotted with red &s;pecks; and brings out her fir&s;t brood about the la&s;t week in <HI>June,</HI> or the fir&s;t week in <HI>July.</HI> The progre&s;&s;ive method by which the young are introduced into life is very amu&s;ing: fir&s;t, they emerge from the &s;haft with difficulty enough, and often fall down into the rooms below: for a day or &s;o they are fed on the chimney-top, and then are conducted to the dead leafle&s;s bough of &s;ome tree, where, &s;itting in a row, they are attended with great a&s;&s;iduity, and may then be called <HI>perchers.</HI> In a day or two more they become <HI>flyers,</HI> but are &s;till unable to take their own food; therefore they play about near the place where the dams are hawking for flies; and, when a mouthful is collected, at a certain &s;ignal given, the dam and the ne&s;tling advance, ri&s;ing towards each other, and meeting at an angle; the young one all the while uttering &s;uch a little quick note of gratitude and complacency, that a per&s;on mu&s;t have paid very little regard to the wonders of Nature that has not often remarked this feat.</P>
<P>The dam betakes her&s;elf immediately to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;econd brood as &s;oon as &s;he is di&s;engaged from her fir&s;t; which at once a&s;&s;ociates with the fir&s;t broods of <HI>hou&s;e-martins;</HI> and with them con|gregates, clu&s;tering on &s;unny roofs, towers, and trees. This hirundo brings out her &s;econd brood towards the middle and end of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>All the &s;ummer long is the &s;wallow a mo&s;t in&s;tructive pattern of unwearied indu&s;try and affection; for, from morning to night, while there is a family to be &s;upported, &s;he &s;pends the whole day in &s;kimming clo&s;e to the ground, and exerting the mo&s;t &s;udden turns and quick evolutions. Avenues, and long walks under
<PB N="170" REF="179">
hedges, and pa&s;ture-fields, and mown meadows where cattle graze, are her delight, e&s;pecially if there are trees inter&s;per&s;ed; becau&s;e in &s;uch &s;pots in&s;ects mo&s;t abound. When a fly is taken a &s;mart &s;nap from her bill is heard, re&s;embling the noi&s;e at the &s;hutting of a watch-ca&s;e; but the motion of the mandibles are too quick for the eye.</P>
<P>The &s;wallow, probably the male bird, is the <HI>excubitor</HI> to hou&s;e|martins, and other little birds, announcing the approach of birds of prey. For as &s;oon as an hawk appears, with a &s;hrill alarming note he calls all the &s;wallows and martins about him; who pur&s;ue in a body, and buffet and &s;trike their enemy till they have driven him from the village, darting down from above on his back, and ri&s;ing in a perpendicular line in perfect &s;ecurity. This bird al&s;o will &s;ound the alarm, and &s;trike at cats when they climb on the roofs of hou&s;es, or otherwi&s;e approach the ne&s;ts. Each &s;pecies of hirundo drinks as it flies along, &s;ipping the &s;urface of the water; but the &s;wallow alone, in general, <HI>wa&s;hes</HI> on the wing, by dropping into a pool for many times together: in very hot weather hou&s;e|martins and bank-martins dip and wa&s;h a little.</P>
<P>The &s;wallow is a delicate &s;ong&s;ter, and in &s;oft &s;unny weather &s;ings both perching and flying; on trees in a kind of concert, and on chimney tops: is al&s;o a bold flyer, ranging to di&s;tant downs and commons even in windy weather, which the other &s;pecies &s;eem much to di&s;like; nay, even frequenting expo&s;ed &s;ea-port towns, and making little excur&s;ions over the &s;alt water. Hor&s;emen on wide downs are often clo&s;ely attended by a little party of &s;wallows for miles together, which plays before and behind them, &s;weeping around, and collecting all the &s;culking in&s;ects that are rou&s;ed by the trampling of the hor&s;es feet: when the wind blows hard, without this expedient, they are often forced to &s;ettle to pick up their lurking prey.</P>

This &s;pecies feeds much on little <HI>coleoptera,</HI> as well as on gnats and flies; and often &s;ettles on dug ground, or paths, for gravels to grind and dige&s;t it's food.

This owl, with the ne&s;t on it's wings, and with eggs in the ne&s;t, was brought as a curio&s;ity worthy the mo&s;t elegant private mu&s;eum in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> The owner, &s;truck with the oddity of the &s;ight, furni&s;hed the bringer with a large &s;hell, or conch, de&s;iring him to fix it ju&s;t where the owl hung: the per|&s;on did as he was ordered, and the following year a pair, pro|bably

the &s;ame pair, built their ne&s;t in the conch, and laid their eggs.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>SELBORNE, <DATE>Feb. 26, 1774.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;and-martin, or bank-martin, is by much the lea&s;t of any of the <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines;</HI> and, as far as we have ever &s;een, the &s;malle&s;t known hirundo: though <HI>Bri&s;&s;on</HI> a&s;&s;erts that there is one much &s;maller, and that is the <HI>hirundo e&s;culenta.</HI></P>
<P>But it is much to be regretted that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for any ob&s;erver to be &s;o full and exact as he could wi&s;h in reciting the circum&s;tances attending the life and conver&s;ation of this little bird, &s;ince it is <HI>fera natur&acirc;,</HI> at lea&s;t in this part of the kingdom, di&s;claim|ing all dome&s;tic attachments, and haunting wild heaths and com|mons where there are large lakes: while the other &s;pecies, e&s;peci|ally the &s;wallow and hou&s;e-martin, are remarkably gentle and dome&s;ticated, and never &s;eem to think them&s;elves &s;afe but under the protection of man.</P>
<P>Here are in this pari&s;h, in the &s;and-pits and banks of the lakes of <HI>Woolmer-fore&s;t,</HI> &s;everal colonies of the&s;e birds; and yet they are never &s;een in the village; nor do they at all frequent the cottages that are &s;cattered about in that wild di&s;trict. The only in&s;tance I ever remember where this &s;pecies haunts any building is at the town of <HI>Bi&s;hop's Waltham,</HI> in this county, where many &s;and-martins ne&s;tle and breed in the &s;caffold-holes of the back-wall of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wykeham</HI>'s &s;tables: but then this wall &s;tands in a very &s;eque&s;tered and
<PB N="176" REF="185">
retired enclo&s;ure, and faces upon a large and beautiful lake. And indeed this &s;pecies &s;eems &s;o to delight in large waters, that no in|&s;tance occurs of their abounding, but near va&s;t pools or rivers: and in particular it has been remarked that they &s;warm in the banks of the <HI>Thames</HI> in &s;ome places below <HI>London-bridge.</HI></P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve with what different degrees of architec|tonic &s;kill Providence has endowed birds of the &s;ame genus, and &s;o nearly corre&s;pondent in their general mode of life! for while the &s;wallow and the hou&s;e-martin di&s;cover the greate&s;t addre&s;s in rai&s;ing and &s;ecurely fixing cru&s;ts or &s;hells of loam as cunabula for their young, the bank-martin terebrates a round and regular hole in the &s;and or earth, which is &s;erpentine, horizontal, and about two feet deep. At the inner end of this burrow does this bird de|po&s;it, in a good degree of &s;afety, her rude ne&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of fine gra&s;&s;es and feathers, u&s;ually goo&s;e-feathers, very inartificially laid together.</P>
<P>Per&s;everance will accompli&s;h any thing: though at fir&s;t one would be di&s;inclined to believe that this weak bird, with her &s;oft and tender bill and claws, &s;hould ever be able to bore the &s;tubborn &s;and-bank without entirely di&s;abling her&s;elf: yet with the&s;e feeble in&s;truments have I &s;een a pair of them make great di&s;patch: and could remark how much they had &s;cooped that day by the fre&s;h &s;and which ran down the bank, and was of a different colour from that which lay loo&s;e and bleached in the &s;un.</P>
<P>In what &s;pace of time the&s;e little arti&s;ts are able to mine and fini&s;h the&s;e cavities I have never been able to di&s;cover, for rea&s;ons given above; but it would be a matter worthy of ob&s;ervation, where it falls in the way of any naturali&s;t to make his remarks. This I have often taken notice of, that &s;everal holes of different depths are left unfini&s;hed at the end of &s;ummer. To imagine that
<PB N="177" REF="186">
the&s;e beginnings were intentionally made in order to be in the greater forwardne&s;s for next &s;pring, is allowing perhaps too much fore&s;ight and <HI>rerum prudentia</HI> to a &s;imple bird. May not the cau&s;e of the&s;e <HI>latebrae</HI> being left unfini&s;hed ari&s;e from their meeting in tho&s;e places with &s;trata too har&s;h, hard, and &s;olid, for their purpo&s;e, which they relinqui&s;h, and go to a fre&s;h &s;pot that works more freely? Or may they not in other places fall in with a &s;oil as much too loo&s;e and mouldering, liable to flounder, and threaten|ing to overwhelm them and their labours?</P>
<P>One thing is remarkable&mdash;that, after &s;ome years, the old holes are for&s;aken and new ones bored; perhaps becau&s;e the old habitations grow foul and fetid from long u&s;e, or becau&s;e they may &s;o abound with fleas as to become untenantable. This &s;pecies of &s;wallow moreover is &s;trangely annoyed with fleas: and we have &s;een fleas, bed-fleas (<HI>pulex irritans</HI>), &s;warming at the mouths of the&s;e holes, like bees on the &s;tools of their hives.</P>
<P>The following circum&s;tance &s;hould by no means be omitted&mdash;that the&s;e birds do <HI>not</HI> make u&s;e of their caverns by way of hyber|nacula, as might be expected; &s;ince banks &s;o perforated have been dug out with care in the winter, when nothing was found but empty ne&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;and-martin arrives much about the &s;ame time with the &s;wallow, and lays, as &s;he does, from four to &s;ix white eggs. But as this &s;pecies is <HI>cryptogame,</HI> carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s of nidification, incubation, and the &s;upport of it's young in the dark, it would not be &s;o ea&s;y to a&s;certain the time of breeding, were it not for the coming forth of the broods, which appear much about the time, or rather &s;omewhat earlier than tho&s;e of the &s;wallow. The ne&s;tlings are &s;upported in common like tho&s;e of their congeners, with gnats and other &s;mall in&s;ects; and &s;ometimes they are fed with <HI>libellulae</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="187">
(dragon-flies) almo&s;t as long as them&s;elves. In the la&s;t week in <HI>June</HI> we have &s;een a row of the&s;e &s;itting on a rail near a great pool as <HI>perchers;</HI> and &s;o young and helple&s;s, as ea&s;ily to be taken by hand: but whether the dams ever feed them on the wing, as &s;wallows and hou&s;e-martins do, we have never yet been able to determine; nor do we know whether they pur&s;ue and attack birds of prey.</P>
<P>When they happen to breed near hedges and enclo&s;ures, they are di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their breeding holes by the hou&s;e-&s;parrow, which is on the &s;ame account a fell adver&s;ary to hou&s;e-martins.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>hirundines</HI> are no &s;ong&s;ters, but rather mute, making only a little har&s;h noi&s;e when a per&s;on approaches their ne&s;ts. They &s;eem not to be of a &s;ociable turn, never with us congregating with their congeners in the autumn. Undoubtedly they breed a &s;econd time, like the hou&s;e-martin and &s;wallow; and withdraw about <HI>Michaelmas.</HI></P>
<P>Though in &s;ome particular di&s;tricts they may happen to abound, yet in the whole, in the &s;outh of <HI>England</HI> at lea&s;t, is this much the rare&s;t &s;pecies. For there are few towns or large villages but what abound with hou&s;e-martins; few churches, towers, or &s;teeples, but what are haunted by &s;ome &s;wifts; &s;carce a hamlet or &s;ingle cottage|chimney that has not it's &s;wallow; while the bank-martins, &s;cattered here and there, live a &s;eque&s;tered life among &s;ome abrupt &s;and-hills, and in the banks of &s;ome few rivers.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds have a peculiar manner of flying; flitting about with odd jerks, and vacillations, not unlike the motions of a butterfly. Doubtle&s;s the flight of all <HI>hirundines</HI> is influenced by, and adapted to, the peculiar &s;ort of in&s;ects which furni&s;h their food. Hence it would be worth inquiry to examine what particular genus of in&s;ects affords the principal food of each re&s;pective &s;pecies of &s;wallow.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="188">
Notwith&s;tanding what has been advanced above, &s;ome few &s;and|martins, I &s;ee, haunt the &s;kirts of <HI>London,</HI> frequenting the dirty pools in <HI>Saint George's-Fields,</HI> and about <HI>White-Chapel.</HI> The que&s;|tion is where the&s;e build, &s;ince there are no banks or bold &s;hores in that neighbourhood: perhaps they ne&s;tle in the &s;caffold holes of &s;ome old or new de&s;erted building. They dip and wa&s;h as they fly &s;ometimes, like the hou&s;e-martin and &s;wallow.</P>
<P>Sand-martins differ from their congeners in the diminutivene&s;s of their &s;ize, and in their colour, which is what is u&s;ually called a mou&s;e-colour. Near <HI>Valencia,</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> they are taken, &s;ays <HI>Willughby,</HI> and &s;old in the markets for the table; and are called by the country people, probably from their de&s;ultory jerking manner of flight, <HI>Papilion de Montagna.</HI></P>

<P>AS the <HI>&s;wift</HI> or <HI>black-martin</HI> is the large&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines,</HI> &s;o is it undoubtedly the late&s;t comer. For I remember but one in&s;tance of it's appearing before the la&s;t week in <HI>April:</HI> and in &s;ome of our late fro&s;ty, har&s;h &s;prings, it has not been &s;een till the begin|ing of <HI>May.</HI> This &s;pecies u&s;ually arrives in pairs.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="189">
The &s;wift, like the &s;and-martin, is very defective in architecture, making no cru&s;t, or &s;hell, for it's ne&s;t; but forming it of dry gra&s;&s;es and feathers, very rudely and inartificially put together. With all my attention to the&s;e birds, I have never been able once to di&s;cover one in the act of collecting or carrying in materials: &s;o that I have &s;u&s;pected (&s;ince their ne&s;ts are exactly the &s;ame) that they &s;ome|times u&s;urp upon the hou&s;e-&s;parrows, and expel them, as &s;parrows do the hou&s;e and &s;and-martin; well remembering that I have &s;een them &s;quabbling together at the entrance of their holes; and the &s;parrows up in arms, and much-di&s;concerted at the&s;e intruders. And yet I am a&s;&s;ured, by a nice ob&s;erver in &s;uch matters, that they do collect feathers for their ne&s;ts in <HI>Andalu&s;ia;</HI> and that he has &s;hot them with &s;uch materials in their mouths.</P>
<P>Swifts, like &s;and-martins, carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of nidification quite in the dark, in crannies of ca&s;tles, and towers, and &s;teeples, and upon the tops of the walls of churches under the roof; and therefore cannot be &s;o narrowly watched as tho&s;e &s;pecies that build more openly: but, from what I could ever ob&s;erve, they begin ne&s;ting about the middle of <HI>May;</HI> and I have remarked, from eggs taken, that they have &s;at hard by the ninth of <HI>June.</HI> In general they haunt tall buildings, churches, and &s;teeples, and breed only in &s;uch: yet in this village &s;ome pairs frequent the lowe&s;t and meane&s;t cottages, and educate their young under tho&s;e thatched roofs. We remember but one in&s;tance where they breed out of buildings; and that is in the &s;ides of a deep chalkpit near the town of <HI>Odiham,</HI> in this county, where we have &s;een many pairs entering the crevices, and &s;kimming and &s;queaking round the precipices.</P>
<P>As I have regarded the&s;e amu&s;ive birds with no &s;mall attention, if I &s;hould advance &s;omething new and peculiar with re&s;pect to them, and different from all other birds, I might perhaps be cre|dited;
<PB N="181" REF="190">
e&s;pecially as my a&s;&s;ertion is the re&s;ult of many years exact ob&s;ervation. The fact that I would advance is, that &s;wifts <HI>tread,</HI> or copulate, on the wing: and I would wi&s;h any nice ob&s;erver, that is &s;tartled at this &s;uppo&s;ition, to u&s;e his own eyes, and I think he will &s;oon be convinced. In another <HI>cla&s;s</HI> of animals, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>in&s;ect,</HI> nothing is &s;o common as to &s;ee the different &s;pecies of many genera in conjunction as they fly. The &s;wift is almo&s;t continually on the wing; and as it never &s;ettles on the ground, on trees, or roofs, would &s;eldom find opportunity for amorous rites, was it not enabled to indulge them in the air. If any per&s;on would watch the&s;e birds of a fine morning in <HI>May,</HI> as they are &s;ailing round at a great height from the ground, he would &s;ee, every now and then, one drop on the back of another, and both of them &s;ink down to|gether for many fathoms with a loud piercing &s;hriek. This I take to be the juncture when the bu&s;ine&s;s of generation is carrying on.</P>
<P>As the &s;wift eats, drinks, collects materials for it's ne&s;t, and, as it &s;eems, propagates on the wing; it appears to live more in the air than any other bird, and to perform all functions there &s;ave tho&s;e of &s;leeping and incubation.</P>
<P>This <HI>hirundo</HI> differs widely from it's congeners in laying invari|ably but <HI>two</HI> eggs at a time, which are milk-white, long, and peaked at the &s;mall end; whereas the other &s;pecies lay at each brood from <HI>four</HI> to <HI>&s;ix.</HI> It is a mo&s;t alert bird, ri&s;ing very early, and retiring to roo&s;t very late; and is on the wing in the height of &s;ummer at lea&s;t &s;ixteen hours. In the longe&s;t days it does not withdraw to re&s;t till a quarter before nine in the evening, being the late&s;t of all day birds. Ju&s;t before they retire whole groups of them a&s;&s;emble high in the air, and &s;queak, and &s;hoot about with wonderful rapidity. But this bird is never &s;o much alive as in &s;ultry thundry weather, when it expre&s;&s;es great alacrity, and calls

forth all it's powers. In hot mornings &s;everal, getting together in little parties, da&s;h round the &s;teeples and churches, &s;queaking as they go in a very clamorous manner: the&s;e, by nice ob&s;ervers, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be males &s;erenading their &s;itting hens; and not with|out rea&s;on, &s;ince they &s;eldom &s;queak till they come clo&s;e to the walls or eaves, and &s;ince tho&s;e within utter at the &s;ame time a little inward note of complacency.</P>
<P>When the hen has &s;at hard all day, &s;he ru&s;hes forth ju&s;t as it is almo&s;t dark, and &s;tretches and relieves her weary limbs, and &s;natches a &s;canty meal for a few minutes, and then returns to her duty of incubation. Swifts, when wantonly and cruelly &s;hot while they have young, di&s;cover a little lump of in&s;ects in their mouths, which they pouch and hold under their tongue. In general they feed in a much higher di&s;trict than the other &s;pecies; a proof that gnats and other in&s;ects do al&s;o abound to a con&s;iderable height in the air: they al&s;o range to va&s;t di&s;tances; &s;ince loco-motion is no labour to them, who are endowed with &s;uch wonderful powers of wing. Their powers &s;eem to be in proportion to their leavers; and their wings are longer in proportion than tho&s;e of almo&s;t any other bird. When they mute, or ca&s;e them&s;elves in flight, they rai&s;e their wings, and make them meet over their backs.</P>
<P>At &s;ome certain times in the &s;ummer I had remarked that &s;wifts were hawking very low for hours together over pools and &s;treams; and could not help inquiring into the object of their pur&s;uit that induced them to de&s;cend &s;o much below their u&s;ual range. After &s;ome trouble, I &s;ound that they were taking <HI>phryganeae, ephemerae,</HI> and <HI>libellulae</HI> (cadew-flies, may-flies, and dragon-flies) that were ju&s;t emerged out of their aurelia &s;tate. I then no longer wondered that they &s;hould be &s;o willing to &s;toop for a prey that afforded them &s;uch plentiful and &s;ucculent nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="194">
They bring out their young about the middle or latter end of <HI>July:</HI> but as the&s;e never become perchers, nor, that ever I could di&s;cern, are fed on the wing by their dams, the coming forth of the young is not &s;o notorious as in the other &s;pecies.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth of la&s;t <HI>June</HI> I untiled the eaves of an hou&s;e where many pairs build, and found in each ne&s;t only <HI>two</HI> &s;quab, naked <HI>pulli:</HI> on the eighth of <HI>July</HI> I repeated the &s;ame inquiry, and found they had made very little progre&s;s towards a fledged &s;tate, but were &s;till naked and helple&s;s. From whence we may conclude that birds who&s;e way of life keeps them perpetually on the wing would not be able to quit their ne&s;t till the end of the month. Swallows and martins, that have numerous families, are continually feeding them every two or three minutes; while &s;wifts, that have but two young to maintain, are much at their lei&s;ure, and do not attend on their ne&s;ts for hours together.</P>
<P>Sometimes they pur&s;ue and &s;trike at hawks that come in their way; but not with that vehemence and fury that &s;wallows expre&s;s on the &s;ame occa&s;ion. They are out all day long in wet days, feed|ing about, and di&s;regarding &s;till rain: from whence two things may be gathered; fir&s;t, that many in&s;ects abide high in the air, even in rain; and next, that the feathers of the&s;e birds mu&s;t be well preened to re&s;i&s;t &s;o much wet. Windy, and particularly windy weather with heavy &s;howers, they di&s;like; and on &s;uch days with|draw, and are &s;carce ever &s;een.</P>
<P>There is a circum&s;tance re&s;pecting the <HI>colour</HI> of &s;wifts, which &s;eems not to be unworthy our attention. When they arrive in the &s;pring they are all over of a glo&s;&s;y, dark &s;oot-colour, except their chins, which are white; but, by being all day long in the &s;un and air, they become quite weather-beaten and bleached before they depart, and yet they return glo&s;&s;y again in the &s;pring. Now, if
<PB N="184" REF="195">
they pur&s;ue the &s;un into lower latitudes, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, in order to enjoy a perpetual &s;ummer, why do they not return bleached? Do they not rather perhaps retire to re&s;t for a &s;ea&s;on, and at that juncture moult and change their feathers, &s;ince all other birds are known to moult &s;oon after the &s;ea&s;on of breeding?</P>
<P>Swifts are very anomalous in many particulars, di&s;&s;enting from all their congeners not only in the number of their young, but in breeding but <HI>once</HI> in a &s;ummer; whereas all the other <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines</HI> breed invariably <HI>twice.</HI> It is pa&s;t all doubt that &s;wifts can breed but once, &s;ince they withdraw in a &s;hort time after the flight of their young, and &s;ome time before their congeners bring out their &s;econd broods. We may here remark, that, as &s;wifts breed but <HI>once</HI> in a &s;ummer, and only <HI>two</HI> at a time, and the other <HI>hirundines twice,</HI> the latter, who lay from four to &s;ix eggs, increa&s;e at an average five times as fa&s;t as the former.</P>
<P>But in nothing are &s;wifts more &s;ingular than in their early retreat. They retire, as to the main body of them, by the tenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and &s;ometimes a few days &s;ooner: and every &s;traggler invariably withdraws by the twentieth, while their congeners, all of them, &s;tay till the beginning of <HI>October;</HI> many of them all through that month, and &s;ome occa&s;ionally to the beginning of <HI>November.</HI> This early retreat is my&s;terious and wonderful, &s;ince that time is often the &s;weete&s;t &s;ea&s;on in the year. But, what is more extraordinary, they begin to retire &s;till earlier in the mo&s;t &s;outherly parts of <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI> where they can be no ways influenced by any defect of heat; or, as one might &s;uppo&s;e, defect of food. Are they regulated in their motions with us by a failure of &s;ood, or by a propen&s;ity to moult|ing, or by a di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;t after &s;o rapid a life, or by what? This is one of tho&s;e incidents in natural hi&s;tory that not only baffles our &s;earches, but almo&s;t eludes our gue&s;&s;es!</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="196">
The&s;e hirundines never perch on trees or roofs, and &s;o never congregate with their congeners. They are fearle&s;s while haunting their ne&s;ting places, and are not to be &s;cared with a gun; and are often beaten down with poles and cudgels as they &s;toop to go under the eaves. Swifts are much infe&s;ted with tho&s;e pe&s;ts to the genus called <HI>hippobo&s;cae hirundinis;</HI> and often wriggle and &s;cratch them|&s;elves, in their flight, to get rid of that clinging annoyance.</P>
<P>Swifts are no &s;ong&s;ters, and have only one har&s;h &s;creaming note; yet there are ears to which it is not di&s;plea&s;ing, from an agree|able a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, &s;ince that note never occurs but in the mo&s;t lovely &s;ummer weather.</P>
<P>They never &s;ettle on the ground but through accident; and when down can hardly ri&s;e, on account of the &s;hortne&s;s of their legs and the length of their wings: neither can they walk, but only crawl; but they have a &s;trong gra&s;p with their feet, by which they cling to walls. Their bodies being flat they can enter a very narrow crevice; and where they cannot pa&s;s on their bellies they will turn up edgewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The particular formation of the foot di&s;criminates the &s;wift from all the <HI>Briti&s;h hirundines;</HI> and indeed from all other known birds, the <HI>hirundo melba,</HI> or great white-bellied &s;wift of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> excepted; for it is &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to carry <Q REND="inline">"<HI>omnes quatuor digitos anticos</HI>"</Q> all it's four toes forward; be&s;ides the lea&s;t toe, which &s;hould be the back-toe, con&s;i&s;ts of one bone alone, and the other three only of two apiece. A con&s;truction mo&s;t rare and peculiar, but nicely adapted to the purpo&s;es in which their feet are employed. This, and &s;ome peculiarities attending the no&s;trils and under mandible, have induced a di&s;cerning <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">John Antony Scopoli, of Carniola, M.D.</NOTE> naturali&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e that this <HI>&s;pecies</HI> might con&s;titute a <HI>genus per &s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="197">
In <HI>London</HI> a party of &s;wifts frequents the <HI>Tower,</HI> playing and feed|ing over the river ju&s;t below the bridge: others haunt &s;ome of the churches of the <HI>Borough</HI> next the fields; but do not venture, like the <HI>hou&s;e-martin,</HI> into the clo&s;e crowded part of the town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> have be&s;towed a very pertinent name on this &s;wallow, calling it <HI>ring &s;wala,</HI> from the perpetual <HI>rings</HI> or circles that it takes round the &s;cene of it's nidification.</P>
<P>Swifts feed on <HI>coleoptera,</HI> or &s;mall beetles with hard ca&s;es over their wings, as well as on the &s;ofter in&s;ects; but it does not appear how they can procure gravel to grind their food, as &s;wallows do, &s;ince they never &s;ettle on the ground. Young ones, over-run with <HI>hippobo&s;cae,</HI> are &s;ometimes found, under their ne&s;ts, fallen to the ground; the number of vermin rendering their abode in&s;upportable any longer. They frequent in this village &s;everal abject cottages; yet a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;till haunts the &s;ame unlikely roofs: a good proof this that the &s;ame birds return to the &s;ame &s;pots. As they mu&s;t &s;toop very low to get up under the&s;e humble eaves, cats lie in wait, and &s;ometimes catch them on the wing.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>July,</HI> 1775, I again untiled part of a roof over the ne&s;t of a &s;wift. The dam &s;at in the ne&s;t; but &s;o &s;trongly was &s;he affected by natural <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> for her brood, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be in danger, that, regardle&s;s of her own &s;afety, &s;he would not &s;tir, but lay &s;ullenly by them, permitting her&s;elf to be taken in hand. The &s;quab young we brought down and placed on the gra&s;s-plot, where they tumbled about, and were as helple&s;s as a new-born child. While we contemplated their naked bodies, their unwieldy di&s;proportioned abdomina, and their heads, too heavy for their necks to &s;upport, we could not but wonder when we reflected that the&s;e &s;hiftle&s;s beings in a little more than a fortnight would be able to da&s;h through the air almo&s;t with the

<P>BY means of a &s;traight cottage-chimney I had an opportunity this &s;ummer of remarking, at my lei&s;ure, how &s;wallows a&s;cend and de&s;cend through the &s;haft: but my plea&s;ure, in contemplating the addre&s;s with which this feat was performed to a con&s;iderable depth in the chimney, was &s;omewhat interrupted by apprehen&s;ions le&s;t my eyes might undergo the &s;ame fate with tho&s;e of <HI>Tobit.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Tobit 2. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;ome amu&s;ement to you to hear at what times the different &s;pecies of hirundines arrived this &s;pring in three very di&s;tant counties of this kingdom. With us the
<PB N="188" REF="199">
&s;wallow was &s;een fir&s;t on <HI>April</HI> the 4th, the &s;wift on <HI>April</HI> the 24th, the bank-martin on <HI>April</HI> the 12th, and the hou&s;e-martin not till <HI>April</HI> the 30th.

Do the&s;e different dates, in &s;uch di&s;tant di&s;trics, prove any thing for or again&s;t migration?</P>
<P>A farmer, near <HI>Weyhill,</HI> fallows his land with two teams of a&s;&s;es; one of which works till noon, and the other in the after|noon. When the&s;e animals have done their work, they are penned all night, like &s;heep, on the fallow. In the winter they are confined and foddered in a yard, and make plenty of dung.</P>
<P><HI>Linnaeus</HI> &s;ays that hawks <Q REND="inline">"<HI>paci&s;cuntur inducias cum avibus, quamdiu cuculus cuculat:</HI>"</Q> but it appears to me that, during that period, many little birds are taken and de&s;troyed by birds of prey, as may be &s;een by their feathers left in lanes and under hedges.</P>
<P>The <HI>mi&s;&s;el-thru&s;h</HI> is, while breeding, fierce and pugnacious, driving &s;uch birds as approach its ne&s;t, with great fury, to a di&s;tance. The <HI>Welch</HI> call it <HI>pen y llwyn,</HI> the head or ma&s;ter of the coppice. He &s;uffers no magpie, jay, or blackbird, to enter the garden where he haunts; and is, for the time, a good guard to the new-&s;own legumens. In general he is very &s;ucce&s;sful in the defence of his family: but once I ob&s;erved in my garden, that &s;everal magpies came determined to &s;torm the ne&s;t of a mi&s;&s;el|thru&s;h: the dams defended their man&s;ion with great vigour, and fought re&s;olutely <HI>pro aris &amp; focis;</HI> but numbers at la&s;t prevailed, they tore the ne&s;t to pieces, and &s;wallowed the young alive.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200">
In the &s;ea&s;on of nidification the wilde&s;t birds are comparatively tame. Thus the <HI>ring-dove</HI> breeds in my fields, though they are continually frequented; and the mi&s;&s;el-thru&s;h, though mo&s;t &s;hy and wild in the autumn and winter, builds in my garden clo&s;e to a walk where people are pa&s;&s;ing all day long.</P>
<P>Wall-fruit abounds with me this year; but my grapes, that u&s;ed to be forward and good, are at pre&s;ent backward beyond all precedent: and this is not the wor&s;t of the &s;tory; for the &s;ame ungenial weather, the &s;ame black cold &s;ol&s;tice, has injured the more nece&s;&s;ary fruits of the earth, and di&s;coloured and blighted our wheat.

<P>ON <HI>September</HI> the 21&s;t, 1741, being then on a vi&s;it, and intent on field-diver&s;ions, I ro&s;e before daybreak: when I came into the enclofures, I found the &s;tubbles and clover-grounds matted all over with a thick coat of cobweb, in the me&s;hes of which a copious and heavy dew hung &s;o plentifully that the whole face of the country &s;eemed, as it were, covered with two or three &s;etting-nets drawn one over another. When the dogs attempted to hunt, their eyes were &s;o blinded and hoodwinked that they could not proceed, but were obliged to lie down and &s;crape the incum|brances from their faces with their fore-feet, &s;o that, finding my &s;port interrupted, I returned home mu&s;ing in my mind on the oddne&s;s of the occurrence.</P>
<P>As the morning advanced the &s;un became bright and warm, and the day turned out one of tho&s;e mo&s;t lovely ones which no &s;ea&s;on but the autumn produces; cloudle&s;s, calm, &s;erene, and worthy of the South of <HI>France</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>About nine an appearance very unu&s;ual began to demand our attention, a &s;hower of cobwebs falling from very elevated regions, and continuing, without any interruption, till the clo&s;e of the day. The&s;e webs were not &s;ingle filmy threads, floating in the air in all directions, but perfect flakes or rags; &s;ome near an
<PB N="191" REF="202">
inch broad, and five or &s;ix long, which fell with a degree of velocity that &s;hewed they were con&s;iderably heavier than the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>On every &s;ide as the ob&s;erver turned his eyes might he behold a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h flakes falling into his &s;ight, and twinkling like &s;tars as they turned their &s;ides towards the &s;un.</P>
<P>How far this wonderful &s;hower extended would be difficult to &s;ay; but we know that it reached <HI>Bradley, Selborne,</HI> and <HI>Alresford,</HI> three places which lie in a &s;ort of a triangle, the &s;horte&s;t of who&s;e &s;ides is about eight miles in extent.</P>
<P>At the &s;econd of tho&s;e places there was a gentleman (for who&s;e veracity and intelligent turn we have the greate&s;t veneration) who ob&s;erved it the moment he got abroad; but concluded that, as &s;oon as he came upon the hill above his hou&s;e, where he took his morning rides, he &s;hould be higher than this meteor, which he imagined might have been blown, like <HI>Thi&s;tle-down,</HI> from the common above: but, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, when he rode to the mo&s;t elevated part of the down, 300 feet above his fields, he found the webs in appearance &s;till as much above him as before; &s;till de&s;cending into &s;ight in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and twinkling in the &s;un, &s;o as to draw the attention of the mo&s;t incurious.</P>
<P>Neither before nor after was any &s;uch fall ob&s;erved; but on this day the flakes hung in the trees and hedges &s;o thick, that a dili|gent per&s;on &s;ent out might have gathered ba&s;kets full.</P>
<P>The remark that I &s;hall make on the&s;e cobweb-like appearances, called <HI>go&s;&s;amer,</HI> is, that, &s;trange and &s;uper&s;titious as the notions about them were formerly, nobody in the&s;e days doubts but that they are the real production of &s;mall &s;piders, which &s;warm in the fields in fine weather in autumn, and have a power of &s;hooting out webs from their tails &s;o as to render them&s;elves buoyant, and
<PB N="192" REF="203">
lighter than air. But why the&s;e apterous in&s;ects &s;hould <HI>that day</HI> take &s;uch a wonderful a&euml;rial excur&s;ino, and why their webs &s;hould at once become &s;o gro&s;s and material as to be con&s;iderably more weighty than air, and to de&s;cend with precipitation, is a matter beyond my &s;kill. If I might be allowed to hazard a &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;hould imagine that tho&s;e filmy threads, when fir&s;t &s;hot, might be entangled in the ri&s;ing dew, and &s;o drawn up, &s;piders and all, by a bri&s;k evaporation into the regions where clouds are formed: and if the &s;piders have a power of coiling and thickening their webs in the air, as Dr. <HI>Li&s;ter</HI> &s;ays they have, [&s;ee his Letters to Mr. <HI>Ray</HI>] then, when they were become heavier than the air, they mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>Every day in fine weather, in autumn chiefly, do I &s;ee tho&s;e &s;piders &s;hooting out their webs and mounting aloft: they will go off from your finger if you will take them into your hand. La&s;t &s;ummer one alighted on my book as I was reading in the parlour; and, running to the top of the page, and &s;hooting out a web, took it's departure from thence. But what I mo&s;t wondered at was, that it went off with con&s;iderable velocity in a place where no air was &s;tirring; and I am &s;ure that I did not a&s;&s;i&s;t it with my breath. So that the&s;e little crawlers &s;eem to have, while mounting, &s;ome loco-motive power without the u&s;e of wings, and to move in the air fa&s;ter than the air it&s;elf.</P>

<P>THERE is a wonderful &s;pirit of &s;ociality in the brute creation, independent of &s;exual attachment: the congregating of grega|rious birds in the winter is a remarkable in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Many hor&s;es, though quiet with company, will not &s;tay one minute in a field by them&s;elves: the &s;tronge&s;t fences cannot re&s;train them. My neighbour's hor&s;e will not only not &s;tay by him&s;elf abroad, but he will not bear to be left alone in a &s;trange &s;table without di&s;covering the utmo&s;t impatience, and endeavour|ing to break the rack and manger with his fore feet. He has been known to leap out at a &s;table-window, through which dung was thrown, after company; and yet in other re&s;pects is remark|ably quiet. Oxen and cows will not fatten by them&s;elves; but will neglect the fine&s;t pa&s;ture that is not recommended by &s;ociety. It would be needle&s;s to in&s;tance in &s;heep, which con&s;tantly flock together.</P>
<P>But this propen&s;ity &s;eems not to be confined to animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies; for we know a doe, &s;till alive, that was brought up from a little &s;awn with a dairy of cows; with them it goes a-field, and with them it returns to the yard. The dogs of the hou&s;e take no notice of this deer, being u&s;ed to her; but, if &s;trange dogs come by, a cha&s;e en&s;ues; while the ma&s;ter &s;miles to &s;ee his favourite &s;ecurely leading her pur&s;uers over hedge, or
<PB N="194" REF="205">
gate, or &s;tile, till &s;he returns to the cows, who, with fierce lowings and menacing horns, drive the a&s;&s;ailants quite out of the pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>Even great di&s;parity of kind and &s;ize does not always prevent &s;ocial advances and mutual fellow&s;hip. For a very intelligent and ob&s;ervant per&s;on has a&s;&s;ured me that, in the former part of his life, keeping but one hor&s;e, he happened al&s;o on a time to have but one &s;olitary hen. The&s;e two incongruous animals &s;pent much of their time together in a lonely orchard, where they &s;aw no creature but each other. By degrees an apparent regard began to take place between the&s;e two &s;eque&s;tered individuals. The fowl would approach the quadruped with notes of com|placency, rubbing her&s;elf gently again&s;t his legs: while the hor&s;e would look down with &s;atisfaction, and move with the greate&s;t caution and circum&s;pection, le&s;t he &s;hould trample on his dimu|nitive companion. Thus, by mutual good offices, each &s;eemed to con&s;ole the vacant hours of the other: &s;o that <HI>Milton,</HI> when he puts the following &s;entiment in the mouth of <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;eems to be &s;omewhat mi&s;taken:

<P>I SHALL make no apology for troubling you with the detail of a very &s;imple piece of dome&s;tic oeconomy, being &s;atisfied that you think nothing beneath your attention that tends to utility: the matter alluded to is the u&s;e of <HI>ru&s;hes</HI> in&s;tead of candles, which I am well aware prevails in many di&s;tricts be&s;ides this; but as I know there are countries al&s;o where it does not obtain, and as I have con&s;idered the &s;ubject with &s;ome degree of exactne&s;s, I &s;hall proceed in my humble &s;tory, and leave you to judge of the expediency.</P>
<P>The proper &s;pecies of <HI>ru&s;h</HI> for this purpo&s;e &s;eems to be the <HI>juncus effu&s;us,</HI> or common &s;oft ru&s;h, which is to be found in mo&s;t moi&s;t pa&s;tures, by the &s;ides of &s;treams, and under hedges. The&s;e ru&s;hes are in be&s;t condition in the height of &s;ummer; but may be gathered, &s;o as to &s;erve the purpo&s;e well, quite on to autumn. It would be needle&s;s to add that the large&s;t and longe&s;t are be&s;t. Decayed labourers, women, and children, make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to procure and prepare them. As &s;oon as they are cut they mu&s;t be flung into water, and kept there; for otherwi&s;e they will dry and &s;hrink, and the peel will not run. At fir&s;t a per&s;on would
<PB N="198" REF="209">
find it no ea&s;y matter to dive&s;t a ru&s;h of it's peel or rind, &s;o as to leave one regular, narrow, even rib from top to bottom that may &s;upport the pith: but this, like other feats, &s;oon becomes familiar even to children; and we have &s;een an old woman, &s;tone-blind, performing this bu&s;ine&s;s with great di&s;patch, and &s;eldom failing to &s;trip them with the nice&s;t regularity. When the&s;e <HI>junci</HI> are thus far prepared, they mu&s;t lie out on the gra&s;s to be bleached, and take the dew for &s;ome nights, and afterwards be dried in the &s;un.</P>
<P>Some addre&s;s is required in dipping the&s;e ru&s;hes in the &s;calding fat or grea&s;e; but this knack al&s;o is to be attained by practice. The careful wife of an indu&s;trious <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> labourer obtains all her fat for nothing; for &s;he &s;aves the &s;cummings of her bacon-pot for this u&s;e; and, if the grea&s;e abounds with &s;alt, &s;he cau&s;es the &s;alt to precipitate to the bottom, by &s;etting the &s;cummings in a warm oven. Where hogs are not much in u&s;e, and e&s;pecially by the &s;ea-&s;ide, the coar&s;er animal-oils will come very cheap. A pound of common grea&s;e may be procured for four pence; and about &s;ix pounds of grea&s;e will dip a pound of ru&s;hes; and one pound of ru&s;hes may be bought for one &s;hilling: &s;o that a pound of ru&s;hes, medicated and ready for u&s;e, will co&s;t three &s;hillings. If men that keep bees will mix a little wax with the grea&s;e, it will give it a con&s;i&s;tency, and render it more cleanly, and make the ru&s;hes burn longer: mutton-&s;uet would have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>A good ru&s;h, which mea&s;ured in length two feet four inches and an half, being minuted, burnt only three minutes &s;hort of an hour: and a ru&s;h &s;till of greater length has been known to burn one hour and a quarter.</P>
<P>The&s;e ru&s;hes give a good clear light. Watch-lights (coated with tallow), it is true, &s;hed a di&s;mal one, <Q REND="inline">"darkne&s;s vi&s;ible;"</Q> but
<PB N="199" REF="210">
then the wick of tho&s;e have <HI>two</HI> ribs of the rind, or peel, to &s;up|port the pith, while the wick of the dipped ru&s;h has but <HI>one.</HI> The <HI>two</HI> ribs are intended to impede the progre&s;s of the flame and make the candle la&s;t.</P>
<P>In a pound of dry ru&s;hes, avoirdupois, which I cau&s;ed to be weighed and numbered, we found upwards of one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred individuals. Now &s;uppo&s;e each of the&s;e burns, one with another, only half an hour, then a poor man will purcha&s;e eight hundred hours of light, a time exceeding thirty-three entire days, for three &s;hillings. According to this account each ru&s;h, before dipping, co&s;ts 1/33 of a farthing, and 1/11 afterwards. Thus a poor family will enjoy 5&frac12; hours of comfortable light for a farthing. An experienced old hou&s;ekeeper a&s;&s;ures me that one pound and an half of ru&s;hes completely &s;upplies his family the year round, &s;ince working people burn no candle in the long days, becau&s;e they ri&s;e and go to bed by daylight.</P>
<P>Little farmers u&s;e ru&s;hes much in the &s;hort days, both morning and evening, in the dairy and kitchen; but the very poor, who are always the wor&s;t oeconomi&s;ts, and therefore mu&s;t continue very poor, buy an halfpenny candle every evening, which, in their blowing open rooms, does not burn much more than two hours. Thus have they only two hours light for their money in&s;tead of eleven.</P>
<P>While on the &s;ubject of rural oeconomy, it may not be improper to mention a pretty implement of hou&s;ewifery that we have &s;een no where el&s;e; that is, little neat be&s;oms which our fore&s;ters make from the &s;talks of the <HI>polytricum commune,</HI> or <HI>great golden maiden-hair,</HI> which they call <HI>&s;ilk-wood,</HI> and find plenty in the bogs.

<P>WE had in this village more than twenty years ago an idiot boy, whom I well remember, who, from a child, &s;hewed a &s;trong propen&s;ity to bees; they were his food, his amu&s;ement, his &s;ole object. And as people of this ca&s;t have &s;eldom more than one point in view, &s;o this lad exerted all his few faculties on this one pur&s;uit. In the winter he do&s;ed away his time, within his father's hou&s;e, by the fire &s;ide, in a kind of torpid &s;tate, &s;eldom departing from the chimney-corner; but in the &s;ummer he was all alert, and in que&s;t of his game in the fields, and on &s;unny banks. Honey-bees, humble-bees, and wa&s;ps, were his prey wherever he found them: he had no apprehen&s;ions from their &s;tings, but would &s;eize
<PB N="201" REF="212">
&s;eize them <HI>nudis manibus,</HI> and at once di&s;arm them of their weapons, and &s;uck their bodies for the &s;ake of their honey-bags. Sometimes he would fill his bo&s;om between his &s;hirt and his &s;kin with a num|ber of the&s;e captives; and &s;ometimes would confine them in bottles. He was a very <HI>merops apia&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>bee-bird;</HI> and very injurious to men that kept bees; for he would &s;lide into their bee-gardens, and, &s;itting down before the &s;tools, would rap with his finger on the hives, and &s;o take the bees as they came out. He has been known to overturn hives for the &s;ake of honey, of which he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond. Where metheglin was making he would linger round the tubs and ve&s;&s;els, begging a draught of what he called <HI>bee-wine.</HI> As he ran about he u&s;ed to make a humming noi&s;e with his lips, re&s;embling the buzzing of bees. This lad was lean and &s;allow, and of a cadaverous complexion; and, except in his favourite pur&s;uit, in which he was wonderfully adroit, di&s;covered no manner of under&s;tanding. Had his capacity been better, and directed to the &s;ame object, he had perhaps abated much of our wonder at the feats of a more modern exhibiter of bees: and we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of him now,<Q><L>" &mdash; Thou,</L>

<P>IT is the harde&s;t thing in the world to &s;hake off &s;uper&s;titious pre|judices: they are &s;ucked in as it were with our mother's milk; and, growing up with us at a time when they take the fa&s;te&s;t hold and make the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions, become &s;o interwoven into our very con&s;titutions, that the &s;tronge&s;t good &s;en&s;e is required to di&s;engage our&s;elves from them. No wonder therefore that the lower people retain them their whole lives through, &s;ince their minds are not invigorated by a liberal education, and therefore not enabled to make any efforts adequate to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such a preamble &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary before we enter on the &s;uper&s;titions of this di&s;trict, le&s;t we &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of exag|geration in a recital of practices too gro&s;s for this enlightened age.</P>
<P>But the people of <HI>Tring,</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> would do well to re|member, that no longer ago than the year 1751, and within twenty miles of the capital, they &s;eized on two &s;uperannuated wretches, crazed with age, and overwhelmed with infirmities, on a &s;u&s;picion of witchcraft; and, by trying experiments, drowned them in a hor&s;e|pond.</P>
<P>In a farm-yard near the middle of this village &s;tands, at this day, a row of pollard-a&s;hes, which, by the &s;eams and long cicatrices down their &s;ides, manife&s;tly &s;hew that, in former times, they have been cleft a&s;under. The&s;e trees, when young and flexible, were &s;evered and held open by wedges, while ruptured children, &s;trip|ped
<PB N="203" REF="216">
naked, were pu&s;hed through the apertures, under a per&s;ua&s;ion that, by &s;uch a proce&s;s, the poor babes would be cured of their infirmity. As &s;oon as the operation was over, the tree, in the &s;uf|fering part, was pla&s;tered with loam, and carefully &s;wathed up. If the parts coale&s;ced and &s;oldered together, as u&s;ually fell out, where the feat was performed with any adroitne&s;s at all, the party was cured; but, where the cleft continued to gape, the operation, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, would prove ineffectual. Having occa&s;ion to enlarge my garden not long &s;ince, I cut down two or three &s;uch trees, one of which did not grow together.</P>
<P>We have &s;everal per&s;ons now living in the village, who, in their childhood, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be healed by this &s;uper&s;titious ceremony, derived down perhaps from our <HI>Saxon</HI> ance&s;tors, who practi&s;ed it before their conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>At the &s;outh corner of the <HI>Ple&s;tor,</HI> or area, near the church, there &s;tood, about twenty-years ago, a very old grote&s;que hollow pol|lard-a&s;h, which for ages had been looked on with no &s;mall vener|ation as a <HI>&s;hrew-a&s;h.</HI> Now a &s;hrew-a&s;h is an a&s;h who&s;e twigs or branches, when gently applied to the limbs of cattle, will immedi|ately relieve the pains which a bea&s;t &s;uffers from the running of a <HI>&s;hrew-mou&s;e</HI> over the part affected: for it is &s;uppo&s;ed that a &s;hrew-mou&s;e is of &s;o baneful and deleterious a nature, that wherever it creeps over a bea&s;t, be it hor&s;e, cow, or &s;heep, the &s;uffering ani|mal is afflicted with cruel angui&s;h, and threatened with the lo&s;s of the u&s;e of the limb. Again&s;t this accident, to which they were continually liable, our provident fore-fathers always kept a &s;hrew-a&s;h at hand, which, when once medicated, would maintain it's virtue for ever. A &s;hrew-a&s;h was made thus<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">For a &s;imilar practice, &s;ee <HI>Plot's Stafford&s;hire.</HI></NOTE>:&mdash;Into the body of the

tree a deep hole was bored with an auger, and a poor devoted &s;hrew-mou&s;e was thru&s;t in alive, and plugged in, no doubt, with &s;everal quaint incantations long &s;ince forgotten.

<P>IN heavy fogs, on elevated &s;ituations e&s;pecially, trees are perfect alembics; and no one that has not attended to &s;uch matters can imagine how much water one tree will di&s;til in a night's time, by conden&s;ing the vapour, which trickles down the twigs and boughs, &s;o as to make the ground below quite in a float. In <HI>Newton-lane,</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="218">
in <HI>October</HI> 1775, on a mi&s;ty day, a particular oak in leaf dropped &s;o fa&s;t that the cart-way &s;tood in puddles and the ruts ran with water, though the ground in general was du&s;ty.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of our &s;maller i&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> if I mi&s;take not, there are no &s;prings or rivers; but the people are &s;upplied with that nece&s;&s;ary element, water, merely by the dripping of &s;ome large tall trees, which, &s;tanding in the bo&s;om of a mountain, keep their heads con&s;tantly enveloped with fogs and clouds, from which they di&s;pen&s;e their kindly never-cea&s;ing moi&s;ture; and &s;o render tho&s;e di&s;tricts habitable by conden&s;ation alone.</P>
<P>Trees in leaf have &s;uch a va&s;t proportion more of &s;urface than tho&s;e that are naked, that, in theory, their conden&s;ations &s;hould greatly exceeed tho&s;e that are &s;tripped of their leaves; but, as the former <HI>imbibe</HI> al&s;o a great quantity of moi&s;ture, it is difficult to &s;ay which drip mo&s;t: but this I know, that deciduous trees that are entwined with much ivy &s;eem to di&s;til the greate&s;t quantity. Ivy|leaves are &s;mooth, and thick, and cold, and therefore conden&s;e very fa&s;t; and be&s;ides ever-greens imbibe very little. The&s;e facts may furni&s;h the intelligent with hints concerning what &s;orts of trees they &s;hould plant round &s;mall ponds that they would wi&s;h to be perennial; and &s;hew them how advantageous &s;ome trees are in pre|ference to others.</P>
<P>Trees per&s;pire profu&s;ely, conden&s;e largely, and check evapor|ation &s;o much, that woods are always moi&s;t; no wonder therefore that they contribute much to pools and &s;treams.</P>
<P>That trees are great promoters of lakes and rivers appears from a well known fact in <HI>North-America;</HI> for, &s;ince the woods and fore&s;ts have been grubbed and cleared, all bodies of water are much dimini&s;hed; &s;o that &s;ome &s;treams, that were very con&s;iderable a
<PB N="206" REF="219">
century ago, will not now drive a common mill<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Kalm</HI>'s Travels to <HI>North-America.</HI></NOTE>. Be&s;ides, mo&s;t woodlands, fore&s;ts, and cha&s;es, with us abound with pools and mora&s;&s;es; no doubt for the rea&s;on given above.</P>
<P>To a thinking mind few phenomena are more &s;trange than the &s;tate of little ponds on the &s;ummits of chalk-hills, many of which are never dry in the mo&s;t trying droughts of &s;ummer. On <HI>chalk-hills</HI> I &s;ay, becau&s;e in many rocky and gravelly &s;oils &s;prings u&s;ually break out pretty high on the &s;ides of elevated grounds and moun|tains; but no per&s;on acquainted with chalky di&s;tricts will allow that they ever &s;aw &s;prings in &s;uch a &s;oil but in vallies and bottoms, &s;ince the waters of &s;o pervious a &s;tratum as chalk all lie on one dead level, as well-diggers have a&s;&s;ured me again and again.</P>
<P>Now we have many &s;uch little round ponds in this di&s;trict; and one in particular on our &s;heep-down, three hundred feet above my hou&s;e; which, though never above three feet deep in the middle, and not more than thirty feet in diameter, and containing perhaps not more than two or three hundred hog&s;heads of water, yet never is known to fail, though it affords drink for three hundred or four hundred &s;heep, and for at lea&s;t twenty head of large cattle be&s;ide. This pond, it is true, is over-hung with two moderate beeches, that, doubtle&s;s, at times afford it much &s;upply: but then we have others as &s;mall, that, without the aid of trees, and in &s;pite of evaporation from &s;un and wind, and perpetual con&s;umption by cattle, yet con&s;tantly maintain a moderate &s;hare of water, without overflowing in the wette&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, as they would do if &s;upplied by &s;prings. By my journal of <HI>May,</HI> 1775, it appears that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;mall and even con&s;iderable ponds in the vales are now dried up, while the &s;mall ponds on the very tops of hills are but little affected."</Q> Can this difference be accounted for from evaporation alone, which certainly is more prevalent in bottoms? or rather have not tho&s;e
<PB N="207" REF="220">
elevated pools &s;ome unnoticed recruits, which in the night time counterbalance the wa&s;te of the day; without which the cattle alone mu&s;t &s;oon exhau&s;t them? And here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter more minutely into the cau&s;e. Dr. <HI>Hales,</HI> in his Vegetable Statics, ad|vances, from experiment, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the moi&s;ter the earth is the more dew falls on it in a night: and more than a <HI>double</HI> quantity of dew falls on a &s;urface of <HI>water</HI> than there does on an equal &s;urface of moi&s;t earth."</Q> Hence we &s;ee that water, by it's coolne&s;s, is enabled to a&s;&s;imilate to it&s;elf a large quantity of moi&s;ture nightly by conden&s;ation; and that the air, when loaded with fogs and vapours, and even with copious dews, can alone advance a con|&s;iderable and never-failing re&s;ource.

<P>MONSIEUR HERISSANT, a <HI>French</HI> anatomi&s;t, &s;eems per&s;uaded that he has di&s;covered the rea&s;on why cuckoos do not hatch their own eggs; the impediment, he &s;uppo&s;es, ari&s;es from the internal &s;tructure of their parts, which incapacitates them for incubation. According to this gentleman, the crop, or craw, of a cuckoo does not lie before the &s;ternum at the bottom of the neck, as in the <HI>gallinae, columbae,</HI> &amp;c. but immediately behind it, on and over the bowels, &s;o as to make a large protuberance in the belly<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;toire de l'Academie Royale,</HI> 1752.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Induced by this a&s;&s;ertion, we procured a cuckoo; and, cutting open the brea&s;t-bone, and expo&s;ing the inte&s;tines to &s;ight, found the crop lying as mentioned above. This &s;tomach was large and round, and &s;tuffed hard like a pincu&s;hion with food, which, upon nice examination, we found to con&s;i&s;t of various in&s;ects; &s;uch as &s;mall &s;carabs, &s;piders, and dragon-flies; the la&s;t of which we have &s;een cuckoos catching on the wing as they were ju&s;t emerging out of the aurelia &s;tate. Among this farrago al&s;o were to be &s;een maggots, and many &s;eeds, which belonged either to goo&s;eberries, currants, cranberries, or &s;ome &s;uch fruit; &s;o that the&s;e birds ap|parently
<PB N="209" REF="222">
&s;ub&s;i&s;t on in&s;ects and fruits: nor was there the lea&s;t ap|pearance of bones, feathers, or fur, to &s;upport the idle notion of their being birds of prey.</P>
<P>The &s;ternum in this bird &s;eemed to us to be remarkably &s;hort, between which and the anus lay the crop, or craw, and immediately behind that the bowels again&s;t the back-bone.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed, as this anatomi&s;t ob&s;erves, that the crop placed ju&s;t upon the bowels mu&s;t, e&s;pecially when full, be in a very unea&s;y &s;ituation during the bu&s;ine&s;s of incubation; yet the te&s;t will be to examine whether birds that are actually known to &s;it for certain are not formed in a &s;imilar manner. This inquiry I propo&s;ed to my&s;elf to make with a <HI>fern-owl,</HI> or goat-&s;ucker, as &s;oon as opportunity offered: becau&s;e, if their formation proves the &s;ame, the rea&s;on for incapacity in the cuckoo will be allowed to have been taken up &s;omewhat ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>Not long after a fern-owl was procured, which, from it's habit and &s;hape, we &s;u&s;pected might re&s;emble the cuckoo in it's internal con&s;truction. Nor were our &s;u&s;picions ill-grounded; for, upon the di&s;&s;ection, the crop, or craw, al&s;o lay behind the &s;ternum, immedi|ately on the vi&s;cera, between them and the &s;kin of the belly. It was bulky, and &s;tuffed hard with large <HI>phalaenae,</HI> moths of &s;everal &s;orts, and their eggs, which no doubt had been forced out of tho&s;e in&s;ects by the action of &s;wallowing.</P>
<P>Now as it appears that this bird, which is &s;o well known to practi&s;e incubation, is formed in a &s;imilar manner with cuckoos, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Heri&s;&s;ant</HI>'s conjecture, that cuckoos are incapable of incu|bation from the di&s;po&s;ition of their inte&s;tines, &s;eems to fall to the ground; and we are &s;till at a lo&s;s for the cau&s;e of that &s;trange and &s;ingular peculiarity in the in&s;tance of the <HI>cuculus canorus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="223">
We found the ca&s;e to be the &s;ame with the ring-tail hawk, in re&s;pect to formation; and, as far as I can recollect, with the &s;wift; and probably it is &s;o with many more &s;orts of birds that are not granivorous.</P>

<P>ON <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 4th, 1775, we &s;urpri&s;ed a large viper, which &s;eemed very heavy and bloated, as it lay in the gra&s;s ba&s;king in the &s;un. When we came to cut it up, we found that the abdomen was crowded with young, fifteen in number; the &s;horte&s;t of which mea&s;ured full &s;even inches, and were about the &s;ize of full-grown earth-worms. This little fry i&s;&s;ued into the world with the true viper-&s;pirit about them, &s;hewing great alertne&s;s as &s;oon as di&s;en|gaged from the belly of the dam: they twi&s;ted and wriggled about, and &s;et them&s;elves up, and gaped very wide when touched with a &s;tick, &s;hewing manife&s;t tokens of menace and defiance, though as yet they had no manner of fangs that we could find, even with the help of our gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="224">
To a thinking mind nothing is more wonderful than that early in&s;tinct which impre&s;&s;es young animals with the notion of the &s;itua|tion of their natural weapons, and of u&s;ing them properly in their own defence, even before tho&s;e weapons &s;ub&s;i&s;t or are formed. Thus a young cock will &s;par at his adver&s;ary before his &s;purs are grown; and a calf or a lamb will pu&s;h with their heads before their horns are &s;prouted. In the &s;ame manner did the&s;e young adders attempt to bite before their fangs were in being. The dam how|ever was furni&s;hed with very formidable ones, which we lifted up (for they fold down when not u&s;ed) and cut them off with the point of our &s;ci&s;&s;ars.</P>
<P>There was little room to &s;uppo&s;e that this brood had ever been in the open air before; and that they were taken in for refuge, at the mouth of the dam, when &s;he perceived that danger was approaching; becau&s;e then probably we &s;hould have found them &s;omewhere in the neck, and not in the abdomen.</P>

<P>CASTRATION has a &s;trange effect: it ema&s;culates both man, bea&s;t, and bird, and brings them to a near re&s;emblance of the other &s;ex. Thus eunuchs have &s;mooth unmu&s;cular arms, thighs, and legs; and broad hips, and beardle&s;s chins, and &s;queaking voices. Gelt-&s;tags and bucks have hornle&s;s heads, like hinds and does. Thus wethers have &s;mall horns, like ewes; and oxen large bent horns, and hoar&s;e voices when they low, like cows: for bulls have &s;hort &s;traight horns; and though they mutter and grumble in a deep tremendous tone, yet they low in a &s;hrill high key. Capons have &s;mall combs and gills, and look pallid about the head, like pullets; they al&s;o walk without any parade, and hover chickens like hens. Barrow-hogs have al&s;o &s;mall tu&s;ks like &s;ows.</P>
<P>Thus far it is plain that the deprivation of <HI>ma&s;culine vigour</HI> puts a &s;top to the growth of tho&s;e parts or appendages that are looked upon as it's in&s;ignia. But the ingenious Mr. <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> in his book on hu&s;bandry, carries it much farther; for he &s;ays that the lo&s;s of tho&s;e in&s;ignia alone has &s;ometimes a &s;trange effect on the ability it&s;elf: he had a boar &s;o fierce and venereous, that, to prevent mi&s;chief, orders were given for his tu&s;ks to be broken off. No &s;ooner had the bea&s;t &s;uffered this injury than his powers for&s;ook him, and he neglected tho&s;e females to whom before he was pa&s;&s;ionately attached, and from whom no fences could re&s;train him.</P>

<P>THE natural term of an hog's life is little known, and the rea&s;on is plain&mdash;becau&s;e it is neither profitable nor convenient to keep that turbulent animal to the full extent of it's time: however, my neighbour, a man of &s;ub&s;tance, who had no occa&s;ion to &s;tudy every little advantage to a nicety, kept an half bred Bantam-&s;ow, who was as thick as &s;he was long, and who&s;e belly &s;wept on the ground till &s;he was advanced to her &s;eventeenth year; at which period &s;he &s;hewed &s;ome tokens of age by the decay of her teeth and the de|cline of her fertility.</P>
<P>For about ten years this prolific mother produced two litters in the year of about ten at a time, and once above twenty at a litter; but, as there were near double the number of pigs to that of teats, many died. From long experience in the world this female was grown very &s;agacious and artful:&mdash;when &s;he found occa&s;ion to conver&s;e with a boar &s;he u&s;ed to open all the intervening gates, and march, by her&s;elf, up to a di&s;tant farm where one was kept; and when her purpo&s;e was &s;erved would return by the &s;ame means. At the age of about fifteen her litters began to be reduced to four or five; and &s;uch a litter &s;he exhibited when in her &s;atting-pen. She proved, when fat, good bacon, juicy, and tender; the rind, or &s;ward, was remarkably thin. At a moderate computation &s;he

<P>WE have remarked in a former letter how much incongruous animals, in a lonely &s;tate, may be attached to each other from a &s;pirit of &s;ociality; in this it may not be ami&s;s to recount a different motive which has been known to create as &s;trange a fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>My friend had a little helple&s;s <HI>leveret</HI> brought to him, which the &s;ervants fed with milk in a &s;poon, and about the &s;ame time his cat kittened and the young were di&s;patched and buried. The hare was &s;oon lo&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be gone the way of mo&s;t fond|lings, to be killed by &s;ome dog or cat. However, in about a fortnight, as the ma&s;ter was &s;itting in his garden in the du&s;k of the evening, he ob&s;erved his cat, with tail erect, trotting towards him, and calling with little &s;hort inward notes of complacency,
<PB N="215" REF="228">
&s;uch as they u&s;e towards their kittens, and &s;omething gamboling after, which proved to be the leveret that the cat had &s;upported with her milk, and continued to &s;upport with great affection.</P>
<P>Thus was a graminivorous animal nurtured by a carnivorous and predaceous one!</P>
<P>Why &s;o cruel and &s;anguinary a bea&s;t as a cat, of the ferocious genus of <HI>Feles,</HI> the <HI>murium leo,</HI> as <HI>Linnaeus</HI> calls it, &s;hould be affected with any tenderne&s;s towards an animal which is it's natural prey, is not &s;o ea&s;y to determine.</P>
<P>This &s;trange affection probably was occa&s;ioned by that de&s;i|derium, tho&s;e tender maternal feelings, which the lo&s;s of her kittens had awakened in her brea&s;t; and by the complacency and ea&s;e &s;he derived to her&s;elf from the procuring her teats to be drawn, which were too much di&s;tended with milk, till, from habit, &s;he became as much delighted with this foundling as if it had been her real offspring.</P>
<P>This incident is no bad &s;olution of that &s;trange circum&s;tance which grave hi&s;torians as well as the poets a&s;&s;ert, of expo&s;ed children being &s;ometimes nurtured by female wild bea&s;ts that pro|bably had lo&s;t their young.

<P>LANDS that are &s;ubject to frequent inundations are always poor; and probably the rea&s;on may be becau&s;e the worms are drowned. The mo&s;t in&s;ignificant in&s;ects and reptiles are of much more con|&s;equence, and have much more influence in the oeconomy of Na|ture, than the incurious are aware of; and are mighty in their effect, from their minutene&s;s, which renders them le&s;s an object of atten|tion; and from their numbers and fecundity. Earth-worms, though in appearance a &s;mall and de&s;picable link in the chain of Nature, yet, if lo&s;t, would make a lamentable cha&s;m. For, to &s;ay nothing of half the birds, and &s;ome quadrupeds which are almo&s;t entirely &s;upport|ed by them, worms &s;eem to be the great promoters of vegetation, which would proceed but lamely without them, by boring, per|forating, and loo&s;ening the &s;oil, and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants, by drawing &s;traws and &s;talks of leaves and twigs into it; and, mo&s;t of all, by throwing up &s;uch infinite numbers of lumps of earth called worm-ca&s;ts, which, being their excrement, is a fine manure for grain and gra&s;s. Worms proba|bly provide new &s;oil for hills and &s;lopes where the rain wa&s;hes the earth away; and they affect &s;lopes, probably to avoid being flood|ed. Gardeners and farmers expre&s;s their dete&s;tation of worms; the former becau&s;e they render their walks un&s;ightly, and make them much work: and the latter becau&s;e, as they think, worms eat their
<PB N="217" REF="230">
green corn. But the&s;e men would find that the earth without worms would &s;oon become cold, hard-bound, and void of fermen|tation; and con&s;equently &s;teril: and be&s;ides, in favour of worms, it &s;hould be hinted that green corn, plants, and flowers, are not &s;o much injured by them as by many &s;pecies of <HI>coleoptera</HI> (&s;carabs), and <HI>tipulae</HI> (long-legs) in their larva, or grub-&s;tate; and by unnoticed myriads of &s;mall &s;hell-le&s;s &s;nails, called &s;lugs, which &s;ilently and imperceptibly make amazing havoc in the field and garden<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Farmer <HI>Young,</HI> of <HI>Norton-farm,</HI> &s;ays that this &s;pring (1777) about four acres of his wheat in one field was entirely de&s;troyed by <HI>&s;lugs,</HI> which &s;warmed on the blades of corn, and devoured it as fa&s;t as it &s;prang.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>YOU cannot but remember that the twenty-&s;ixth and twenty-&s;eventh of la&s;t <HI>March</HI> were very hot days; &s;o fultry that every body complained and were re&s;tle&s;s under tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations to which they had not been reconciled by gradual approaches.</P>
<P>This &s;udden &s;ummer-like heat was attended by many &s;ummer coincidences; for on tho&s;e two days the thermometer ro&s;e to &s;ixty-&s;ix in the &s;hade; many &s;pecies of in&s;ects revived and came forth; &s;ome bees &s;warmed in this neighbourhood; the old tortoi&s;e, near <HI>Lewes,</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> awakened and came forth out of it's dormi|tory; and, what is mo&s;t to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, many <HI>hou&s;e-&s;wallows</HI> appeared and were very alert in many places, and particularly at <HI>Cobham,</HI> in <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>But as that &s;hort warm period was &s;ucceeded as well as preceded by har&s;h &s;evere weather, with frequent fro&s;ts and ice, and cutting winds, the in&s;ects withdrew, the tortoi&s;e retired again into the ground, and the &s;wallows were &s;een no more until the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> when, the rigour of the &s;pring abating, a &s;ofter &s;ea&s;on began to prevail.</P>
<P>Again; it appears by my journals for many years pa&s;t that <HI>hou&s;e-martins</HI> retire, to a bird, about the beginning of <HI>October;</HI> &s;o that a per&s;on not very ob&s;ervant of &s;uch matters would conclude that they

The preceding day was wet and blu&s;tering, but the fourth was dark and mild, and &s;oft, the wind at &s;outh-we&s;t, and the ther|mometer at 58&frac12;; a pitch not common at that &s;ea&s;on of the year. Moreover, it may no the ami&s;s to add in this place, that whenever the thermometer is above 50 the bat comes flitting out in every autumnal and winter-month.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances laid together, it is obvious that torpid in&s;ects, reptiles, and quadrupeds, are awakened from their profounde&s;t &s;lumbers by a little untimely warmth; and therefore that nothing &s;o much promotes this death-like &s;tupor as a defect of heat.

<P>THERE was in this village &s;everal years ago a mi&s;erable pauper, who, from his birth, was afflicted with a lepro&s;y, as far as we are aware of a &s;ingular kind, &s;ince it affected only the palms of his hands and the &s;oles of his feet. This &s;caly eruption u&s;ually broke out twice in the year, at the &s;pring and fall; and, by peeling away, left the &s;kin &s;o thin and tender that neither his hands or feet were able to perform their functions; &s;o that the poor object was half his time on crutches, incapable of employ, and langui&s;hing in a tire&s;ome &s;tate of indolence and inactivity. His habit was lean, lank, and cadaverous. In this &s;ad plight he dragged on a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, a burden to him&s;elf and his pari&s;h, which was obliged to &s;upport him till he was relieved by death at more than thirty years of age.</P>
<P>The good women, who love to account for every defect in chil|dren by the doctrine of longing, &s;aid that his mother felt a violent propen&s;ity for oy&s;ters, which &s;he was unable to gratify; and that the black rough &s;curf on his hands and feet were the &s;hells of that fi&s;h. We knew his parents, neither of which were lepers; his father in particular lived to be far advanced in years.</P>
<P>In all ages the lepro&s;y has made dreadful havock among man|kind. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;eem to have been greatly afflicted with it
<PB N="221" REF="234">
from the mo&s;t remote times; as appears from the peculiar and re|peated injunctions given them in the <HI>Levitical</HI> law<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">See Leviticus, chap. xiii. and xiv.</NOTE>. Nor was the rancour of this foul di&s;order much abated in the la&s;t period of their commonwealth, as may be &s;een in many pa&s;&s;ages of the New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>Some centuries ago this horrible di&s;temper prevailed all <HI>Europe</HI> over; and our forefathers were by no means exempt, as appears by the large provi&s;ion made for objects labouring under this cala|mity. There was an ho&s;pital for female lepers in the dioce&s;e of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> a noble one near <HI>Durham,</HI> three in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Southwark,</HI> and perhaps many more in or near our great towns and cities. Moreover, &s;ome crowned heads, and other wealthy and charitable per&s;onages, bequeathed large legacies to &s;uch poor people as lan|gui&s;hed under this hopele&s;s infirmity.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore, in the&s;e days, be, to an humane and think|ing per&s;on, a matter of equal wonder and &s;atisfaction, when he contemplates how nearly this pe&s;t is eradicated, and ob&s;erves that a leper now is a rare &s;ight. He will, moreover, when engaged in &s;uch a train of thought, naturally inquire for the rea&s;on. This happy change perhaps may have originated and been continued from the much &s;maller quantity of &s;alted meat and fi&s;h now eaten in the&s;e kingdoms; from the u&s;e of linen next the &s;kin; from the plenty of better bread; and from the profu&s;ion of fruits, roots, legumes, and greens, &s;o common in every family. Three or four centuries ago, before there were any enclo&s;ures, &s;own-gra&s;&s;es, field-turnips, or field-carrots, or hay, all the cattle which had grown fat in &s;ummer, and were not killed for winter-u&s;e, were turned out &s;oon after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> to &s;hift as they could through the
<PB N="222" REF="235">
dead months; &s;o that no fre&s;h meat could be had in winter or &s;pring. Hence the marvellous account of the va&s;t &s;tores of &s;alted fle&s;h found in the larder of the elde&s;t <HI>Spencer</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Viz.</HI> Six hundred bacons, eighty carca&s;&s;es of beef, and &s;ix hundred muttons.</NOTE> in the days of <HI>Edward</HI> the Second, even &s;o late in the &s;pring as the third of <HI>May.</HI> It was from magazines like the&s;e that the turbulent barons &s;upported in idlene&s;s their riotous &s;warms of retainers ready for any di&s;order or mi&s;chief. But agriculture is now arrived at &s;uch a pitch of per|fection, that our be&s;t and fatte&s;t meats are killed in the winter; and no man need eat &s;alted fle&s;h, unle&s;s he prefers it, that has money to buy fre&s;h.</P>
<P>One cau&s;e of this di&s;temper might be, no doubt, the quantity of wretched fre&s;h and &s;alt fi&s;h con&s;umed by the commonalty at all &s;ea&s;ons as well as in lent; which our poor now would hardly be per&s;uaded to touch.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of linen changes, &s;hirts or &s;hifts, in the room of &s;ordid and filthy woollen, long worn next the &s;kin, is a matter of neatne&s;s comparatively modern; but mu&s;t prove a great means of preventing cutaneous ails. At this very time woollen in&s;tead of linen prevails among the poorer <HI>Welch,</HI> who are &s;ubject to foul eruptions.</P>
<P>The plenty of good wheaten bread that now is found among all ranks of people in the &s;outh, in&s;tead of that mi&s;erable &s;ort which u&s;ed in old days to be made of barley or beans, may con|tribute not a little to the &s;weetening their blood and correcting their juices; for the inhabitants of mountainous di&s;tricts, to this day, are &s;till liable to the itch and other cutaneous di&s;orders, from a wretchedne&s;s and poverty of diet.</P>
<P>As to the produce of a garden, every middle-aged per&s;on of ob&s;ervation may perceive, within his own memory, both in town
<PB N="223" REF="236">
and country, how va&s;tly the con&s;umption of vegetables is increa&s;ed. Green-&s;talls in cities now &s;upport multitudes in a comfortable &s;tate, while gardeners get fortunes. Every decent labourer al&s;o has his garden, which is half his &s;upport, as well as his delight; and common farmers provide plenty of beans, peas, and greens, for their hinds to eat with their bacon; and tho&s;e few that do not are de&s;pi&s;ed for their &s;ordid par&s;imony, and looked upon as regard|le&s;s of the welfare of their dependants.

<P>IN a di&s;trict &s;o diver&s;ified as this, &s;o full of hollow vales and hanging woods, it is no wonder that echoes &s;hould abound. Many we have di&s;covered that return the cry of a pack of dogs, the notes of a hunting-horn, a tunable ring of bells, or the melody of birds, very agreeably: but we were &s;till at a lo&s;s for a poly&s;yllabical,
<PB N="225" REF="238">
articulate echo, till a young gentleman, who had parted from his company in a &s;ummer evening walk, and was calling after them, &s;tumbled upon a very curious one in a &s;pot where it might lea&s;t be expected. At fir&s;t he was much &s;urpri&s;ed, and could not be per|&s;uaded but that he was mocked by &s;ome boy; but, repeating his trials in &s;everal languages, and finding his re&s;pondent to be a very adroit polyglot, he then di&s;cerned the deception.</P>
<P>This echo in an evening, before rural noi&s;es cea&s;e, would re|peat ten &s;yllables mo&s;t articulately and di&s;tinctly, e&s;pecially if quick dactyls were cho&s;en. The la&s;t &s;yllables of
<Q><L>"Tityre, tu patulae recubans &mdash;"</L></Q>
were as audibly and intelligibly returned as the fir&s;t: and there is no doubt, could trial have been made, but that at midnight, when the air is very ela&s;tic, and a dead &s;tillne&s;s prevails, one or two &s;yllables more might have been obtained; but the di&s;tance rendered &s;o late an experiment very inconvenient.</P>
<P>Quick dactyls, we ob&s;erved, &s;ucceeded be&s;t; for when we came to try it's powers in &s;low, heavy, embara&s;&s;ed &s;pondees of the &s;ame number of &s;yllables,
<Q><L>"Mon&s;trum horrendum, informe, ingens &mdash;"</L></Q>
we could perceive a return but of four or five.</P>
<P>All echoes have &s;ome one place to which they are returned &s;tronger and more di&s;tinct than to any other; and that is always the place that lies at right angles with the object of repercu&s;&s;ion, and is not too near, nor too far off. Buildings, or naked rocks, re|echo much more articulately than hanging wood or vales; becau&s;e in the latter the voice is as it were entangled, and embara&s;&s;ed in the covert, and weakened in the rebound.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="239">
The true object of this echo, as we found by various experi|ments, is the &s;tone-built, tiled hop-kiln in <HI>Gally-lane,</HI> which mea|&s;ures in front 40 feet, and from the ground to the eaves 12 feet. The true <HI>centrum phonicum,</HI> or ju&s;t di&s;tance, is one particular &s;pot in the <HI>King's-field,</HI> in the path to <HI>Nore-hill,</HI> on the very brink of the &s;teep balk above the hollow cart way. In this ca&s;e there is no choice of di&s;tance; but the path, by meer contingency, happens to be the lucky, the identical &s;pot, becau&s;e the ground ri&s;es or falls &s;o immediately, if the &s;peaker either retires or advances, that his mouth would at once be above or below the object.</P>
<P>We mea&s;ured this poly&s;yllabical echo with great exactne&s;s, and found the di&s;tance to fall very &s;hort of Dr. <HI>Plot</HI>'s rule for di&s;tinct articulation: for the Doctor, in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> allows 120 feet for the return of each &s;yllable di&s;tinctly: hence this echo, which gives ten di&s;tinct &s;yllables, ought to mea&s;ure 400 yards, or 120 feet to each &s;yllable; whereas our di&s;tance is only 258 yards, or near 75 feet, to each &s;yllable. Thus our mea&s;ure falls &s;hort of the Doctor's, as five to eight: but then it mu&s;t be acknowledged that this candid philo&s;opher was convinced afterwards, that &s;ome latitude mu&s;t be admitted of in the di&s;tance of echoes according to time and place.</P>
<P>When experiments of this &s;ort are making, it &s;hould always be remembered that weather and the time of day have a va&s;t in|fluence on an echo; for a dull, heavy, moi&s;t air deadens and clogs the &s;ound; and hot &s;un&s;hine renders the air thin and weak, and deprives it of all it's &s;pringine&s;s; and a ruffling wind quite defeats the whole. In a &s;till, clear, dewy evening the air is mo&s;t ela&s;tic; and perhaps the later the hour the more &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="240">
Echo has always been &s;o amu&s;ing to the imagination, that the poets have per&s;onified her; and in their hands &s;he has been the occa&s;ion of many a beautiful fiction. Nor need the grave&s;t man be a&s;hamed to appear taken with &s;uch a phaenomenon, &s;ince it may become the &s;ubject of philo&s;ophical or mathematical inquiries.</P>
<P>One &s;hould have imagined that echoes, if not entertaining, mu&s;t at lea&s;t have been harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive; yet <HI>Virgil</HI> advances a &s;trange notion, that they are injurious to bees. After enumerating &s;ome probable and rea&s;onable annoyances, &s;uch as prudent owners would wi&s;h far removed from their bee-gardens, he adds
<Q><L>" &mdash; aut ubi concava pul&s;u</L>
<L>"Saxa &s;onant, voci&s;que offen&s;a re&s;ultat imago."</L></Q></P>
<P>This wild and fanciful a&s;&s;ertion will hardly be admitted by the philo&s;ophers of the&s;e days; e&s;pecially as they all now &s;eem agreed that in&s;ects are not furni&s;hed with any organs of hearing at all. But if it &s;hould be urged, that though they cannot <HI>hear</HI> yet per|haps they may <HI>feel</HI> the repercu&s;&s;ions of &s;ounds, I grant it is po&s;|&s;ible they may. Yet that the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions are di&s;ta&s;teful or hurtful, I deny, becau&s;e bees, in good &s;ummers, thrive well in my outlet, where the echoes are very &s;trong: for this village is another <HI>Anathoth,</HI> a place of <HI>re&s;pon&s;es</HI> or <HI>echoes.</HI> Be&s;ides, it does not ap|pear from experiment that bees are in any way capable of being affected by &s;ounds: for I have often tried my own with a large &s;peaking-trumpet held clo&s;e to their hives, and with &s;uch an exer|tion of voice as would have haled a &s;hip at the di&s;tance of a mile, and &s;till the&s;e in&s;ects pur&s;ued their various employments undi&s;|turbed, and without &s;hewing the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ibility or re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="241">
Some time &s;ince it's di&s;covery this echo is become totally &s;ilent, though the object, or hop-kiln, remains: nor is there any my&s;tery in this defect; for the field between is planted as an hop-garden, and the voice of the &s;peaker is totally ab&s;orbed and lo&s;t among the poles and entangled foliage of the hops. And when the poles are removed in autumn the di&s;appointment is the &s;ame; becau&s;e a tall quick-&s;et hedge, nurtered up for the purpo&s;e of &s;helter to the hop ground, entirely interrupts the impul&s;e and repercu&s;&s;ion of the voice: &s;o that till tho&s;e ob&s;tructions are removed no more of it's garrulity can be expected.</P>
<P>Should any gentleman of fortune think an echo in his park or outlet a plea&s;ing incident, he might <HI>build</HI> one at little or no ex|pen&s;e. For whenever he had occa&s;ion for a new barn, &s;table, dog|kennel, or the like &s;tructure, it would be only needful to erect this building on the gentle declivity of an hill, with a like ri&s;ing oppo|&s;ite to it, at a few hundred yards di&s;tance; and perhaps &s;ucce&s;s might be the ea&s;ier en&s;ured could &s;ome canal, lake, or &s;tream, intervene. From a &s;eat at the <HI>centrum phonicum</HI> he and his friends might amu&s;e them&s;elves &s;ometimes of an evening with the prattle of this loquacious nymph; of who&s;e complacency and decent re|&s;erve more may be &s;aid than can with truth of every individual of her &s;ex; &s;ince &s;he is &mdash;

<P>AMONG the many &s;ingularities attending tho&s;e amu&s;ing birds the <HI>&s;wifts,</HI> I am now confirmed in the opinion that we have every year the &s;ame number of pairs invariably; at lea&s;t the re&s;ult of my in|quiry has been exactly the &s;ame for a long time pa&s;t. The &s;wallows and martins are &s;o numerous, and &s;o widely di&s;tributed over the village, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to recount them; while the &s;wifts, though they do not all build in the church, yet &s;o frequently haunt it, and play and rendezvous round it, that they are ea&s;ily enumerated. The number that I con&s;tantly find are <HI>eight pairs;</HI> about half of which re&s;ide in the church, and the re&s;t build in &s;ome of the lowe&s;t and meane&s;t thatched cottages. Now as the&s;e eight pairs, allowance being made for accidents, breed yearly eight pairs more, what becomes annually of this increa&s;e; and what determines every &s;pring which pairs &s;hall vi&s;it us, and re|occupy their ancient haunts?</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I have attended to the &s;ubject of ornithology, I have always &s;uppo&s;ed that that &s;udden rever&s;e of affection, that &s;trange <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, which immediately &s;ucceeds in the feathered kind to the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s, is the occa&s;ion of an equal di&s;per&s;ion of birds over the face of the earth. Without this provi&s;ion one favourite di&s;trict would be crowded with inhabitants, while others
<PB N="231" REF="244">
would be de&s;titute and for&s;aken. But the parent birds &s;eem to maintain a jealous &s;uperiority, and to oblige the young to &s;eek for new abodes: and the rivalry of the males, in many kinds, prevents their crowding the one on the other. Whether the &s;wallows and hou&s;e-martins return in the &s;ame exact number annually is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, for rea&s;ons given above: but it is apparent, as I have re|marked before in my Monographies, that the numbers returning bear no manner of proportion to the numbers retiring.</P>

<P>THE &s;tanding objection to botany has always been, that it is a pur&s;uit that amu&s;es the fancy and exerci&s;es the memory, with|out improving the mind or advancing any real knowledge: and, where the &s;cience is carried no farther than a mere &s;y&s;tematic cla&s;&s;ification, the charge is but too true. But the botani&s;t that is de&s;irous of wiping off this a&s;per&s;ion &s;hould be by no means con|tent with a li&s;t of names; he &s;hould &s;tudy plants philo&s;ophically, &s;hould inve&s;tigate the laws of vegetation, &s;hould examine the powers and virtues of efficacious herbs, &s;hould promote their
<PB N="232" REF="245">
cultivation; and graft the gardener, the planter, and the hu&s;band|man, on the phytologi&s;t. Not that &s;y&s;tem is by any means to be thrown a&s;ide; without &s;y&s;tem the field of Nature would be a pathle&s;s wilderne&s;s; but &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient to, not the main object of, pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Vegetation is highly worthy of our attention; and in it&s;elf is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to mankind, and productive of many of the greate&s;t comforts and elegancies of life. To plants we owe timber, bread, beer, honey, wine, oil, linen, cotton, &amp;c. what not only &s;trengthens our hearts, and exhilerates our &s;pirits, but what &s;ecures us from inclemencies of weather and adorns our per|&s;ons. Man, in his true &s;tate of nature, &s;eems to be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by &s;pontaneous vegetation: in middle climes, where gra&s;&s;es prevail, he mixes &s;ome animal food with the produce of the field and gar|den: and it is towards the polar extremes only that, like his kin|dred bears and wolves, he gorges him&s;elf with fle&s;h alone, and is driven, to what hunger has never been known to compel the very bea&s;ts, to prey on his own &s;pecies.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">See the late Voyages to the &s;outh-&s;eas.</NOTE></P>
<P>The productions of vegetation have had a va&s;t influence on the commerce of nations, and have been the great promoters of navi|gation, as may be &s;een in the articles of &s;ugar, tea, tobacco, opium, gin&s;eng, betel, paper, &amp;c. As every climate has it's peculiar pro|duce, our natural wants bring on a mutual intercour&s;e; &s;o that by means of trade each di&s;tant part is &s;upplied with the growth of every latitude. But, without the knowledge of plants and their culture, we mu&s;t have been content with our hips and haws, with|out enjoying the delicate fruits of <HI>India</HI> and the &s;alutiferous drugs of <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="246">
In&s;tead of examining the minute di&s;tinctions of every various &s;pecies of each ob&s;cure genus, the botani&s;t &s;hould endeavour to make him&s;elf acquainted with tho&s;e that are u&s;eful. You &s;hall &s;ee a man readily a&s;certain every herb of the field, yet hardly know wheat from barley, or at lea&s;t one &s;ort of wheat or barley from another.</P>
<P>But of all &s;orts of vegetation the <HI>gra&s;&s;es</HI> &s;eem to be mo&s;t ne|glected; neither the farmer nor the grazier &s;eem to di&s;tingui&s;h the annual from the perennial, the hardy from the tender, nor the &s;ucculent and nutritive from the dry and juicele&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of gra&s;&s;es would be of great con&s;equence to a norther|ly, and grazing kingdom. The botani&s;t that could improve the &s;werd of the di&s;trict where he lived would be an u&s;eful member of &s;ociety: to rai&s;e a thick turf on a naked &s;oil would be worth volumes of &s;y&s;tematic knowledge; and he would be the be&s;t com|monwealth's man that could occa&s;ion the growth of <Q REND="inline">"<HI>two blades of gra&s;s</HI> where <HI>one</HI> alone was &s;een before."</Q></P>

<P>A GOOD ornithologi&s;t &s;hould be able to di&s;tingui&s;h birds by their air as well as by their colours and &s;hape; on the ground as well as on the wing, and in the bu&s;h as well as in the hand. For, though it mu&s;t not be &s;aid that every <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of birds has a manner peculiar to it&s;elf, yet there is &s;omewhat in mo&s;t <HI>genera</HI> at lea&s;t, that at fir&s;t &s;ight di&s;criminates them, and enables a judicious ob&s;erver to pronounce upon them with &s;ome certainty.

<P>Thus <HI>kites</HI> and <HI>buzzards</HI> &s;ail round in circles with wings expand|ed and motionle&s;s; and it is from their gliding manner that the former are &s;till called in the north of <HI>England gleads,</HI> from the <HI>Saxon</HI> verb <HI>glidan,</HI> to glide. The <HI>ke&s;trel,</HI> or <HI>wind-hover,</HI> has a peculiar mode of hanging in the air in one place, his wings all the while being bri&s;kly agitated. <HI>Hen-harriers</HI> &s;ly low over heaths or fields of corn, and beat the ground regularly like a pointer or &s;etting-dog. <HI>Owls</HI> move in a buoyant manner, as if lighter than the air; they &s;eem to want balla&s;t. There is a peculiarity belonging to <HI>ravens</HI> that mu&s;t draw the attention even of the mo&s;t incurious&mdash;they &s;pend all

their lei&s;ure time in &s;triking and cuffing each other on the wing in a kind of playful &s;kirmi&s;h; and, when they move from one place to another, frequently turn on their backs with a loud croak, and &s;eem to be falling to the ground. When this odd ge&s;ture betides them, they are &s;cratching them&s;elves with one foot, and thus lo&s;e the center of gravity. <HI>Rooks</HI> &s;ometimes dive and tumble in a frolick&s;ome manner; <HI>crows</HI> and <HI>daws</HI> &s;wagger in their walk; <HI>wood-peckers</HI> &s;ly <HI>volatu undo&s;o,</HI> opening and clo&s;ing their wings at every &s;troke, and &s;o are always ri&s;ing or falling in curves. All of this genus u&s;e their tails, which incline downward, as a &s;upport while they run up trees. <HI>Parrots,</HI> like all other hooked-clawed birds, walk aukwardly, and make u&s;e of their bill as a third foot, climbing and de&s;cending with ridiculous caution. All the <HI>gallinae</HI> parade and walk gracefully, and run nimbly; but fly with dif|ficulty, with an impetuous whirring, and in a &s;traight line. <HI>Mag|pies</HI> and <HI>jays</HI> flutter with powerle&s;s wings, and make no di&s;patch; <HI>herons</HI> &s;eem incumbered with too much &s;ail for their light bodies; but the&s;e va&s;t hollow wings are nece&s;&s;ary in carrying burdens, &s;uch as large fi&s;hes, and the like; <HI>pigeons,</HI> and particularly the &s;ort called <HI>&s;miters,</HI> have a way of cla&s;hing their wings the one again&s;t the other over their backs with a loud &s;nap; another variety called <HI>tumblers</HI> turn them&s;elves over in the air. Some birds have move|ments peculiar to the &s;ea&s;on of love: thus <HI>ring-doves,</HI> though &s;trong and rapid at other times, yet in the &s;pring hang about on the wing in a toying and playful manner; thus the <HI>cock-&s;nipe,</HI> while breed|ing, forgetting his former flight, fans the air like the wind-hover; and the <HI>green-finch</HI> in particular exhibits &s;uch langui&s;hing and faultering ge&s;tures as to appear like a wounded and dying bird; the <HI>king-fi&s;her</HI> darts along like an arrow; <HI>fern-owls,</HI> or <HI>goat-&s;uckers,</HI> glance in the du&s;k over the tops of trees like a meteor; <HI>&s;tarlings</HI>

<OPENER><DATELINE>SELBORNE, <DATE>Sept. 9, 1778.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the motion of birds, the tran&s;ition is natural enough to their notes and language, of which I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething. Not that I would pretend to under&s;tand their language like the <HI>vizier;</HI> who, by the recital of a conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between two owls, reclaimed a &s;ultan,<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See Spectator, Vol. VII, N^o. 512.</NOTE> before delighting in conque&s;t and de|va&s;tation; but I would be thought only to mean that many of the winded tribes have various &s;ounds and voices adapted to ex|pre&s;s their various pa&s;&s;ions, wants, and feelings; &s;uch as anger, fear, love, hatred, hunger, and the like. All &s;pecies are not equally eloquent; &s;ome are copious and fluent as it were in their utterance, while others are confined to a few important &s;ounds: no bird, like the fi&s;h kind, is quite mute, though &s;ome are rather &s;ilent. The language of birds is very ancient, and, like other ancient modes of &s;peech, very elliptical; little is &s;aid, but much is meant and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The notes of the eagle-kind are &s;hrill and piercing; and about the &s;ea&s;on of nidification much diver&s;ified, as I have been often a&s;&s;ured by a curious ob&s;erver of Nature, who long re&s;ided at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> where eagles abound. The notes of our <HI>hawks</HI> much re&s;emble tho&s;e of the king of birds. <HI>Owls</HI> have very expre&s;&s;ive notes; they hoot in a fine vocal &s;ound, much re&s;embling the <HI>vox</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="254">
<HI>Lumana,</HI> and reducible by a pitch-pipe to a mu&s;ical key. This note &s;eems to expre&s;s complacency and rivalry among the males: they u&s;e al&s;o a quick call and an horrible &s;cream; and can &s;nore and hi&s;s when they mean to menace. <HI>Ravens,</HI> be&s;ides their loud croak, can exert a deep and &s;olemn note that makes the woods to echo; the amorous &s;ound of a <HI>crow</HI> is &s;trange and ridiculous; <HI>rooks,</HI> in the breeding &s;ea&s;on, attempt &s;ometimes in the gaiety of their hearts to &s;ing, but with no great &s;ucce&s;s; the <HI>parrot</HI>-kind have many modulations of voice, as appears by their aptitude to learn human &s;ounds; <HI>doves</HI> coo in an amorous and mournful manner, and are emblems of de&s;pairing lovers; the <HI>woodpecker</HI> &s;ets up a &s;ort of loud and hearty laugh; the <HI>fern-owl,</HI> or <HI>goat-&s;ucker,</HI> from the du&s;k till day-break, &s;erenades his mate with the clattering of ca&s;tanets. All the tuneful <HI>pa&s;&s;eres</HI> expre&s;s their complacency by &s;weet modulations, and a variety of me|lody. The <HI>&s;wallow,</HI> as has been ob&s;erved in a former letter, by a &s;hrill alarm be&s;peaks the attention of the other <HI>hirundines,</HI> and bids them be aware that the hawk is at hand. Aquatic and gre|garious birds, e&s;pecially the nocturnal, that &s;hift their quarters in the dark, are very noi&s;y and loquacious; as cranes, wild-gee&s;e, wild-ducks, and the like: their perpetual clamour prevents them from di&s;per&s;ing and lo&s;ing their companions.</P>
<P>In &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;ubject, &s;ketches and outlines are as much as can be expected; for it would be endle&s;s to in&s;tance in all the infinite variety of the feathered nation. We &s;hall therefore confine the remainder of this letter to the few dome&s;tic fowls of our yards, which are mo&s;t known, and therefore be&s;t under&s;tood. And fir&s;t the <HI>peacock,</HI> with his gorgeous train, demands our attention; but, like mo&s;t of the gaudy birds, his notes are grating and &s;hocking to the car: the yelling of cats, and the braying of an a&s;s, are not
<PB N="242" REF="255">
more di&s;gu&s;tful. The voice of the <HI>goo&s;e</HI> is trumpet-like, and clanking; and once &s;aved the Capitol at <HI>Rome,</HI> as grave hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ert: the hi&s;s al&s;o of the <HI>gander</HI> is formidable and full of menace, and <Q REND="inline">"protective of his young."</Q> Among <HI>ducks</HI> the &s;exual di&s;|tinction of voice is remarkable; for, while the <HI>quack</HI> of the female is loud and &s;onorous, the voice of the <HI>drake</HI> is inward and har&s;h, and feeble, and &s;carce di&s;cernible. The cock <HI>turkey</HI> &s;truts and gobbles to his mi&s;tre&s;s in a mo&s;t uncouth manner; he hath al&s;o a pert and petulant note when he attacks his adver&s;ary. When a hen <HI>turkey</HI> leads forth her young brood &s;he keeps a watchful eye; and if a bird of prey appear, though ever &s;o high in the air, the careful mother announces the enemy with a little inward moan, and watches him with a &s;teady and attentive look; but, if he approach, her note becomes earne&s;t and alarming, and her outcries are redoubled.</P>
<P>No inhabitants of a yard &s;eem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a variety of expre&s;&s;ion and &s;o copious a language as common poultry. Take a chicken of four or five days old, and hold it up to a window where there are flies, and it will immediately &s;eize it's prey, with little twitterings of complacency; but if you tender it a wa&s;p or a bee, at once it's note becomes har&s;h, and expre&s;&s;ive of di&s;approbation and a &s;en&s;e of danger. When a pullet is ready to lay &s;he intimates the event by a joyous and ea&s;y &s;oft note. Of all the occurrences of their life that of <HI>laying</HI> &s;eems to be the mo&s;t important; for no &s;ooner has a hen di&s;burdened her&s;elf, than &s;he ru&s;hes forth with a clamorous kind of joy, which the cock and the re&s;t of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es immediately adopt. The tumult is not confined to the family concerned, but catches from yard to yard, and &s;preads to every home&s;tead within hearing, till at la&s;t the whole village is in an uproar. As &s;oon as a hen becomes a mother
<PB N="243" REF="256">
her new relation demands a new language; &s;he then runs clocking and &s;creaming about, and &s;eems agitated as if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The father of the flock has al&s;o a con&s;iderable vocabulary; if he finds food, he calls a favourite concubine to partake; and if a bird of prey pa&s;&s;es over, with a warning voice he bids his family beware. The gallant <HI>chanticleer</HI> has, at command, his amorous phra&s;es and his terms of defiance. But the &s;ound by which he is be&s;t known is his <HI>crowing:</HI> by this he has been di&s;tingui&s;hed in all ages as the countryman's clock or larum, as the watchman that proclaims the divi&s;ions of the night. Thus the poet elegantly &s;tyles him:
<Q><L>" &mdash; the cre&s;ted cock, who&s;e clarion &s;ounds</L>
<L>"The &s;ilent hours."</L></Q></P>
<P>A neighbouring gentleman one &s;ummer had lo&s;t mo&s;t of his chickens by a &s;parrow-hawk, that came gliding down between a faggot pile and the end of his hou&s;e to the place where the coops &s;tood. The owner, inwardly vexed to &s;ee his flock thus dimi|ni&s;hing, hung a &s;etting net adroitly between the pile and the hou&s;e, into which the caitif da&s;hed, and was entangled. Re&s;entment &s;ugge&s;ted the law of retaliation; he therefore clipped the hawk's wings, cut off his talons, and, fixing a cork on his bill, threw him down among the brood-hens. Imagination cannot paint the &s;cene that en&s;ued; the expre&s;&s;ions that fear, rage, and revenge, in&s;pired, were new, or at lea&s;t &s;uch as had been unnoticed before: the exa&s;perated matrons upbraided, they execrated, they in&s;ulted, they triumphed. In a word, they never de&s;i&s;ted from buffering their adver&s;ary till they had torn him in an hundred pieces.</P>

<P>GENTLEMEN who have outlets might contrive to make orna|ment &s;ub&s;ervient to utility: a plea&s;ing eye-trap might al&s;o contri|bute to promote &s;cience: an obeli&s;k in a garden or park might be both an embelli&s;hment and an <HI>heliotrope.</HI></P>
<P>Any per&s;on that is curious, and enjoys the advantage of a good horizon, might, with little trouble, make two <HI>heliotropes;</HI> the one for the <HI>winter,</HI> the other for the <HI>&s;ummer</HI> &s;ol&s;tice: and the&s;e two erections might be con&s;tructed with very little expen&s;e; for two pieces of timber frame-work, about ten or twelve feet high, and four feet broad at the ba&s;e, and clo&s;e lined with plank, would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The erection for the former &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be placed within &s;ight of &s;ome window in the common &s;itting parlour; be|cau&s;e men, at that dead &s;ea&s;on of the year, are u&s;ually within doors at the clo&s;e of the day; while that for the latter might be fixed for any given &s;pot in the garden or outlet: whence the owner might contemplate, in a fine &s;ummer's evening, the utmo&s;t extent that the &s;un makes to the <HI>northward</HI> at the &s;ea&s;on of the longe&s;t

days. Now nothing would be nece&s;&s;ary but to place the&s;e two <HI>objects</HI> with &s;o much exactne&s;s, that the <HI>we&s;terly</HI> limb of the &s;un, at &s;etting, might but ju&s;t clear the <HI>winter heliotrope</HI> to the <HI>we&s;t</HI> of it on the <HI>&s;horte&s;t</HI> day; and that the <HI>whole</HI> di&s;c of the &s;un, at the <HI>longe&s;t</HI> day, might exactly at &s;etting al&s;o clear the <HI>&s;ummer heliotrope</HI> to the <HI>north</HI> of it.</P>
<P>By this &s;imple expedient it would &s;oon appear that there is no &s;uch thing, &s;trictly &s;peaking, as a &s;ol&s;tice; for, from the <HI>&s;horte&s;t</HI> day, the owner would, every clear evening, &s;ee the di&s;c <HI>advancing,</HI> at it's &s;etting, to the <HI>we&s;tward</HI> of the object; and, from the <HI>longe&s;t</HI> day, ob&s;erve the &s;un <HI>retiring</HI> backwards every evening at it's &s;et|ing, towards the object <HI>we&s;tward,</HI> till, in a few nights, it would &s;et quite behind it, and &s;o by degrees to the <HI>we&s;t</HI> of it: for when the &s;un comes near the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, the whole di&s;c of it would at fir&s;t &s;et behind the object; after a time the <HI>northern</HI> limb would fir&s;t appear, and &s;o every night gradually more, till at length the whole diameter would &s;et <HI>northward</HI> of it for about three nights; but on the middle night of the three, &s;en&s;ibly more remote than the former or following. When beginning it's rece&s;s from the &s;ummer tropic, it would continue more and more to be hidden every night, till at length it would de&s;cend quite behind the object again; and &s;o nightly more and more to the <HI>we&s;tward.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN I was a boy I u&s;ed to read, with a&s;toni&s;hment and im|plicit a&s;&s;ent, accounts in <HI>Baker's Chronicle</HI> of walking hills and travelling mountains. <HI>John Philips,</HI> in his <HI>Cyder,</HI> alludes to the credit that was given to &s;uch &s;tories with a delicate but quaint vein of humour peculiar to the author of the <HI>Splendid Shilling.</HI></P>

<P>But, when I came to con&s;ider better, I began to &s;u&s;pect that though our hills may never have journeyed far, yet that the ends of many of them have &s;lipped and fallen away at di&s;tant periods, leaving the cliffs bare and abrupt. This &s;eems to have been the ca&s;e with <HI>Nore</HI> and <HI>Whetham Hills;</HI> and e&s;pecially with the ridge between <HI>Harteley Park</HI> and <HI>Word-le-ham,</HI> where the ground has &s;lid into va&s;t &s;wellings and furrows; and lies &s;till in &s;uch romantic

confu&s;ion as cannot be accounted for from any other cau&s;e. A &s;trange event, that happened not long &s;ince, ju&s;tifies our &s;u&s;|picions; which, though it befell not within the limits of this pari&s;h, yet as it was within the hundred of <HI>Selborne,</HI> and as the circum&s;tances were &s;ingular, may fairly claim a place in a work of this nature.</P>
<P>The months of <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> in the year 1774, were re|markable for great melting &s;nows and va&s;t gluts of rain; &s;o that by the end of the latter month the land-&s;prings, or <HI>lavants,</HI> began to prevail, and to be near as high as in the memorable winter of 1764. The beginning of <HI>March</HI> al&s;o went on in the &s;ame tenor; when, in the night between the 8th and 9th of that month, a con&s;iderable part of the great woody hanger at <HI>Hawkley</HI> was torn from it's place, and fell down, leaving a high free-&s;tone cliff naked and bare, and re&s;embling the &s;teep &s;ide of a chalk-pit. It appears that this huge fragment, being perhaps &s;apped and undermined by waters, foundered, and was ingulfed, going down in a per|pendicular direction; for a gate which &s;tood in the field, on the top of the hill, after &s;inking with it's po&s;ts for thirty or forty feet, remained in &s;o true and upright a po&s;ition as to open and &s;hut with great exactne&s;s, ju&s;t as in it's fir&s;t &s;ituation. Several oaks al&s;o are &s;till &s;tanding, and in a &s;tate of vegetation, after taking the &s;ame de&s;perate leap. That great part of this prodi|gious ma&s;s was ab&s;orbed in &s;ome gulf below, is plain al&s;o from the inclining ground at the bottom of the hill, which is free and unincumbered; but would have been buried in heaps of rubbi&s;h, had the fragment parted and fallen forward. About an hundred yards from the foot of this hanging coppice &s;tood a cottage by the &s;ide of a lane; and two hundred yards lower, on the other &s;ide of the lane, was a farm-hou&s;e, in which lived a labourer and

his family; and, ju&s;t by, a &s;tout new barn. The cottage was inhabited by an old woman and her &s;on, and his wife. The&s;e people in the evening, which was very dark and tempe&s;tuous, ob&s;erved that the brick floors of their kitchens began to heave and part; and that the walls &s;eemed to open, and the roofs to crack: but they all agree that no tremor of the ground, indicating an earthquake, was ever felt; only that the wind continued to make a mo&s;t tremen|dous roaring in the woods and hangers. The mi&s;erable inhabi|tants, not daring to go to bed, remained in the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude and confu&s;ion, expecting every moment to be buried under the ruins of their &s;hattered edifices. When day-light came they were at lei&s;ure to contemplate the deva&s;tations of the night: they then found that a deep rift, or cha&s;m, had opened under their hou&s;es, and torn them, as it were, in two; and that one end of the barn had &s;uffered in a &s;imilar manner; that a pond near the cottage had undergone a &s;trange rever&s;e, becoming deep at the &s;hallow end, and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;a;</HI> that many large oaks were removed out of their perpendicular, &s;ome thrown down, and &s;ome fallen into the heads of neighbouring trees; and that a gate was thru&s;t forward, with it's hedge, full &s;ix feet, &s;o as to require a new track to be made to it. From the foot of the cliff the general cour&s;e of the ground, which is pa&s;ture, inclines in a moderate de&s;cent for half a mile, and is inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome hillocks, which were rifted, in every direction, as well towards the great woody hanger, as from it. In the fir&s;t pa&s;ture the deep clefts began; and running acro&s;s the lane, and under the buildings, made &s;uch va&s;t &s;helves that the road was impa&s;&s;able for &s;ome time; and &s;o over to an arable field on the other &s;ide, which was &s;trangely torn and di&s;|ordered. The &s;econd pa&s;ture field, being more &s;oft and &s;pringy, was protruded forward without many fi&s;&s;ures in the turf, which
<PB N="249" REF="264">
was rai&s;ed in long ridges re&s;embling graves, lying at right angles to the motion. At the bottom of this enclo&s;ure the &s;oil and turf ro&s;e many feet again&s;t the bodies of &s;ome oaks that ob&s;tructed their farther cour&s;e and terminated this awful commotion.</P>
<P>The perpendicular height of the precipice, in general, is twenty-three yards; the length of the lap&s;e, or &s;lip, as &s;een from the fields below, one hundred and eighty-one; and a partial fall, concealed in the coppice, extends &s;eventy yards more: &s;o that the total length of this fragment that fell was two hundred and fifty-one yards. About fifty acres of land &s;uffered from this violent convul&s;ion; two hou&s;es were entirely de&s;troyed; one end of a new barn was left in ruins, the walls being cracked through the very &s;tones that compo&s;ed them; a hanging coppice was changed to a naked rock; and &s;ome gra&s;s grounds and an arable field &s;o broken and rifted by the cha&s;ms as to be rendered, for a time, neither fit for the plough or &s;afe for pa&s;turage, till con&s;iderable labour and expen&s;e had been be&s;towed in levelling the &s;urface and filling in the gaping fi&s;&s;ures.</P>

<Q><L>" &mdash; re&s;onant arbu&s;ta &mdash;"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is a &s;teep abrupt pa&s;ture field inter&s;per&s;ed with furze clo&s;e to the back of this village, well known by the name of the <HI>Short Lirhe,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a rocky dry &s;oil, and inclining to the afternoon &s;un. This &s;pot abounds with the <HI>gryllus campe&s;tris,</HI> or <HI>field-cricket;</HI> which, though frequent in the&s;e parts, is by no means a common in&s;ect in many other counties.</P>
<P>As their cheerful &s;ummer cry cannot but draw the attention of a naturali&s;t, I have often gone down to examine the oeconomy of the&s;e <HI>grylli,</HI> and &s;tudy their mode of life: but they are &s;o &s;hy and cautious that it is no ea&s;y matter to get a &s;ight of them; for, feeling a per&s;on's foot&s;teps as he advances, they &s;top &s;hort in the mid&s;t of their &s;ong, and retire backward nimbly into their burrows, where they lurk till all &s;u&s;picion of danger is over.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t we attempted to dig them out with a &s;pade, but without any great &s;ucce&s;s; for either we could not get to the bottom of the hole, which often terminated under a great &s;tone; or el&s;e, in breaking up the ground, we inadvertently &s;queezed the poor in|&s;ect to death. Out of one &s;o brui&s;ed we took a multitude of eggs,
<PB N="251" REF="266">
which were long and narrow, of a yellow colour, and covered with a very tough &s;kin. By this accident we learned to di&s;tingui&s;h the male from the female; the former of which is &s;hining black, with a golden &s;tripe acro&s;s his &s;houlders; the latter is more du&s;ky, more capacious about the abdomen, and carries a long &s;word-&s;haped weapon at her tail, which probably is the in&s;trument with which &s;he depo&s;its her eggs in crannies and &s;afe receptacles.</P>
<P>Where violent methods will not avail, more gentle means will often &s;ucceed; and &s;o it proved in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; for, though a &s;pade be too boi&s;terous and rough an implement, a pliant &s;talk of gra&s;s, gently in&s;inuated into the caverns, will probe their wind|ings to the bottom, and quickly bring out the inhabitant; and thus the humane inquirer may gratify his curio&s;ity without injur|ing the object of it. It is remarkable that, though the&s;e in&s;ects are furni&s;hed with long legs behind, and brawny thighs for leap|ing, like gra&s;shoppers; yet when driven from their holes they &s;hew no activity, but crawl along in a &s;hiftle&s;s manner, &s;o as ea&s;ily to be taken: and again, though provided with a curious apparatus of wings, yet they never exert them when there &s;eems to be the greate&s;t occa&s;ion. The males only make that &s;hrilling noi&s;e perhaps out of rivalry and emulation, as is the ca&s;e with many animals which exert &s;ome &s;prightly note during their breeding time: it is rai&s;ed by a bri&s;k friction of one wing again&s;t the other. They are &s;olitary beings, living &s;ingly male or female, each as it may happen; but there mu&s;t be a time when the &s;exes have &s;ome intercour&s;e, and then the wings may be u&s;eful perhaps during the hours of night. When the males meet they will &s;ight &s;iercely, as I found by &s;ome which I put into the crevices of a dry &s;tone wall, where I &s;hould have been glad to have made them &s;ettle. For though they &s;eemed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by being taken out of their know|ledge,
<PB N="252" REF="267">
yet the fir&s;t that got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chinks would &s;eize on any that were obtruded upon them with a va&s;t row of &s;errated fangs. With their &s;trong jaws, toothed like the &s;hears of a lob&s;ter's claws, they perforate and round their curious regular cells, having no fore-claws to dig, like the mole-cricket. When taken in hand I could not but wonder that they never offered to defend them|&s;elves, though armed with &s;uch formidable weapons. Of &s;uch herbs as grow before the mouths of their burrows they eat indi&s;crimi|nately; and on a little platform, which they make ju&s;t by, they drop their dung; and never, in the day time, &s;eem to &s;tir more than two or three inches from home. Sitting in the entrance of their caverns they chirp all night as well as day from the middle of the month of <HI>May</HI> to the middle of <HI>July;</HI> and in hot weather, when they are mo&s;t vigorous, they make the hills echo; and, in the &s;tiller hours of darkne&s;s, may be heard to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. In the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on their notes are more faint and in|ward; but become louder as the &s;ummer advances, and &s;o die away again by degrees.</P>
<P>Sounds do not always give us plea&s;ure according to their &s;weet|ne&s;s and melody; nor do har&s;h &s;ounds always di&s;plea&s;e. We are more apt to be captivated or di&s;gu&s;ted with the a&s;&s;ociations which they promote, than with the notes them&s;elves. Thus the &s;hrilling of the <HI>field-cricket,</HI> though &s;harp and &s;tridulous, yet marvellou&s;ly delights &s;ome hearers, filling their minds with a train of &s;ummer ideas of every thing that is rural, verdurous, and joyous.</P>
<P>About the tenth of <HI>March</HI> the crickets appear at the mouths of their cells, which they then open and bore, and &s;hape very ele|gantly. All that ever I have &s;een at that &s;ea&s;on were in their pupa &s;tate, and had only the rudiments of wings, lying under a &s;kin or

In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> their holes begin to be obliterated, and the in&s;ects are &s;een no more till &s;pring.</P>
<P>Not many &s;ummers ago I endeavoured to tran&s;plant a colony to the terrace in my garden, by boring deep holes in the &s;loping turf. The new inhabitants &s;tayed &s;ome time, and fed and &s;ung; but wandered away by degrees, and were heard at a farther di&s;|tance every morning; &s;o that it appears that on this emergency they made u&s;e of their wings in attempting to return to the &s;pot from which they were taken.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e crickets, when confined in a paper cage and &s;et in the &s;un, and &s;upplied with plants moi&s;tened with water, will feed and thrive, and become &s;o merry and loud as to be irk&s;ome in the &s;ame room where a per&s;on is &s;itting: if the plants are not wetted it will die.</P>

<P>WHILE many other in&s;ects mu&s;t be &s;ought after in fields and woods, and waters, the <HI>gryllus dome&s;ticus,</HI> or <HI>hou&s;e-cricket,</HI> re&s;ides al|together within our dwellings, intruding it&s;elf upon our notice whether we will or no. This &s;pecies delights in new-built hou&s;es, being, like the &s;pider, plea&s;ed with the moi&s;ture of the walls; and be&s;ides, the &s;oftne&s;s of the mortar enables them to burrow and mine between the joints of the bricks or &s;tones, and to open communications from one room to another. They are particularly fond of kitchens and bakers' ovens, on account of their perpe|tual warmth.</P>
<P>Tender in&s;ects that live abroad either enjoy only the &s;hort period of one &s;ummer, or el&s;e doze away the cold uncom|fortable months in profound &s;lumbers; but the&s;e, re&s;iding as it were in a torrid zone, are always alert and merry: a good <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> fire is to them like the heats of the dog-days. Though they are frequently heard by day, yet is their natural time of motion only in the night. As &s;oon as it grows du&s;k, the chirping increa&s;es, and they come running forth, and are from the &s;ize of a flea to that of their full &s;tature. As one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, from the
<PB N="255" REF="270">
burning atmo&s;phere which they inhabit, they are a thir&s;ty race, and &s;hew a great propen&s;ity for liquids, being found frequently drowned in pans of water, milk, broth, or the like. Whatever is moi&s;t they affect; and therefore often gnaw holes in wet woollen &s;tockings and aprons that are hung to the fire: they are the hou&s;ewife's barometer, foretelling her when it will rain; and are progno&s;tic &s;ometimes, &s;he thinks, of ill or good luck; of the death of a near relation, or the approach of an ab&s;ent lover. By being the con&s;tant companions of her &s;olitary hours they naturally become the objects of her &s;uper&s;tition. The&s;e crickets are not only very thir&s;ty, but very voracious; for they will eat the &s;cummings of pots, and yea&s;t, &s;alt, and crumbs of bread; and any kitchen offal or &s;weepings. In the &s;ummer we have ob|&s;erved them to fly, when it became du&s;k, out of the windows, and over the neighbouring roofs. This feat of activity accounts for the &s;udden manner in which they often leave their haunts, as it does for the method by which they come to hou&s;es where they were not known before. It is remarkable, that many &s;orts of in&s;ects &s;eem never to u&s;e their wings but when they have a mind to &s;hift their quarters and &s;ettle new colonies. When in the air they move <Q REND="inline">"<HI>volatu undo&s;o,</HI>"</Q> in waves or curves, like <HI>wood-peckers,</HI> opening and &s;hutting their wings at every &s;troke, and &s;o are always ri&s;ing or &s;inking.</P>
<P>When they increa&s;e to a great degree, as they did once in the hou&s;e where I am now writing, they become noi&s;ome pe&s;ts, &s;lying into the candles, and da&s;hing into people's faces; but may be bla&s;ted and de&s;troyed by gunpowder di&s;charged into their cre|vices and crannies. In families, at &s;uch times, they are, like Pharaoh's plague of frogs,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in their bedchambers, and upon their beds, and in their ovens, and in their kneading|troughs<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Exod. viii. 3.</NOTE>."</Q><PB N="256" REF="271"> Their &s;hrilling noi&s;e is occa&s;ioned by a bri&s;k attrition of their wings. Cats catch hearth-crickets, and, playing with them as they do with mice, devour them. Crickets may be de&s;troyed, like wa&s;ps, by phials half filled with beer, or any liquid, and &s;et in their haunts; for, being always eager to drink, they will crowd in till the bottles are full.</P>

<P>HOW diver&s;ified are the modes of life not only of incongruous but even of congenerous animals; and yet their &s;pecific di&s;tinc|tions are not more various than their propen&s;ities. Thus, while the <HI>field-cricket</HI> delights in &s;unny dry banks, and the <HI>hou&s;e-cricket</HI> rejoices amid&s;t the glowing heat of the kitchen hearth or oven, the <HI>gryllus gryllo talpa</HI> (the <HI>mole-cricket</HI>), haunts moi&s;t meadows, and frequents the &s;ides of ponds and banks of &s;treams, performing all it's functions in a &s;wampy wet &s;oil. With a pair of fore-feet, curiou&s;ly adapted to the purpo&s;e, it burrows and works under ground like the mole, rai&s;ing a ridge as it proceeds, but &s;eldom throwing up hillocks.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="272">
As <HI>mole-crickets</HI> often infe&s;t gardens by the &s;ides of canals, they are unwelcome gue&s;ts to the gardener, rai&s;ing up ridges in their &s;ubterraneous progre&s;s, and rendering the walks un&s;ightly. If they take to the kitchen quarters, they occa&s;ion great damage among the plants and roots, by de&s;troying whole beds of cab|bages, young legumes, and flowers. When dug out they &s;eem very &s;low and helple&s;s, and make no u&s;e of their wings by day; but at night they come abroad, and make long excur&s;ions, as I have been convinced by finding &s;tragglers, in a morning, in improbable places. In fine weather, about the middle of <HI>April,</HI> and ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of day, they begin to &s;olace them&s;elves with a low, dull, jarring note, continued for a long time without interruption, and not unlike the chattering of the fern-owl, or goat-&s;ucker, but more inward.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>May</HI> they lay their eggs, as I was once an eye-witne&s;s: for a gardener at an hou&s;e, where I was on a vi&s;it, happening to be mowing, on the 6th of that month, by the &s;ide of a canal, his &s;cythe &s;truck too deep, pared off a large piece of turf, and laid open to view a curious &s;cene of dome&s;tic oeconomy:<Q><L>" &mdash; ingentem lato dedit ore fene&s;tram:</L>
<L>"Apparet domus intus, et atria longa pate&s;cunt:</L>
<L>"Apparent &mdash; penetralia."</L></Q></P>
<P>There were many caverns and winding pa&s;&s;ages leading to a kind of chamber, neatly &s;moothed and rounded, and about the &s;ize of a moderate &s;nuff-box. Within this &s;ecret nur&s;ery were depo&s;ited near an hundred eggs of a dirty yellow colour, and enveloped in a tough &s;kin, but too lately excluded to contain any rudiments of young, being full of a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance. The eggs
<PB N="258" REF="273">
lay but &s;hallow, and within the influence of the &s;un, ju&s;t under a little heap of fre&s;h-mowed mould, like that which is rai&s;ed by ants.</P>
<P>When <HI>mole-crickets</HI> fly they move <Q REND="inline">"<HI>cur&s;u undo&s;o,</HI>"</Q> ri&s;ing and falling in curves, like the other &s;pecies mentioned before. In different parts of this kingdom people call them <HI>fen-crickets, churr|worms,</HI> and <HI>eve-churrs,</HI> all very appo&s;ite names.</P>

by the terms of <HI>himantopus,</HI> or <HI>loripes,</HI> and <HI>charadrius himan|topus,</HI> were &s;hot upon the verge of <HI>Frin&s;ham-pond,</HI> a large lake be|longing to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and lying between <HI>Woolmer-fore&s;t,</HI> and the town of <HI>Farnham,</HI> in the county of <HI>Surrey.</HI> The pond keeper &s;ays there were three brace in the &s;lock; but that, after he had &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity, he &s;uffered the &s;ixth to remain unmo|le&s;ted.

The&s;e birds are of the <HI>plover</HI> family, and might with propriety be called the <HI>&s;tilt plovers. Bri&s;&s;on,</HI> under that idea, gives them the appo&s;ite name of <HI>l'echa&s;&s;e.</HI> My &s;pecimen, when drawn and &s;tuffed with pepper, weighed only four ounces and a quarter, though the <HI>naked</HI> part of the thigh mea&s;ured three inches and an half, and the legs four inches and an half. Hence we may &s;afely a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e birds exhibit, weight for inches, incomparably the greate&s;t length of legs of any known bird. The <HI>flamingo,</HI> for in&s;tance, is one of the mo&s;t long legged birds, and yet it bears no manner of proportion to the <HI>himantopus;</HI> for a cock <HI>flamingo</HI> weighs, at an average, about four pounds avoirdupois; and his legs and thighs mea&s;ure u&s;ually about twenty inches. But four pounds are fifteen times and a fraction more than four ounces, and one quarter; and if four ounces and a quarter have eight inches of legs, four pounds mu&s;t have one hundred and twenty inches and a fraction of legs; <HI>viz.</HI> &s;omewhat more than ten feet; &s;uch a mon&s;trous proportion as the world never &s;aw! If you &s;hould try the experiment in &s;till larger birds the di&s;parity would &s;till increa&s;e. It mu&s;t be matter of great
<PB N="260" REF="276">
curio&s;ity to &s;ee the <HI>&s;tilt plover</HI> move; to ob&s;erve how it can wield &s;uch a length of lever with &s;uch feeble mu&s;cles as the thighs &s;eem to be furni&s;hed with. At be&s;t one &s;hould expect it to be but a bad walker: but what adds to the wonder is, that it has no back toe. Now without that &s;teady prop to &s;upport it's &s;teps it mu&s;t be liable, in &s;peculation, to perpetual vacillations, and &s;eldom able to pre&s;erve the true center of gravity.</P>
<P>The old name of <HI>himantopus</HI> is taken from <HI>Pliny;</HI> and, by an aukward metaphor, implies that the legs are as &s;lender and pliant as if cut out of a <HI>thong</HI> of leather. Neither <HI>Willughby</HI> nor <HI>Ray,</HI> in all their curious re&s;earches, either at home or abroad, ever &s;aw this bird. Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> never met with it in all <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but ob&s;erved it often in the cabinets of the curious at <HI>Paris. Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t</HI> &s;ays that it migrates to <HI>Egypt</HI> in the autumn: and a mo&s;t accurate ob&s;erver of Nature has a&s;&s;ured me that he has found it on the banks of the &s;treams in <HI>Andalu&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Our writers record it to have been found only twice in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> From all the&s;e relations it plainly appears that the&s;e long legged <HI>plovers</HI> are birds of <HI>South Europe,</HI> and rarely vi&s;it our i&s;land; and when they do are wanderers and &s;tragglers, and impelled to make &s;o di&s;tant and northern an excur&s;ion from motives or ac|cidents for which we are not able to account. One thing may fairly be deduced, that the&s;e birds come over to us from the con|tinent, &s;ince nobody can &s;uppo&s;e that a &s;pecies not noticed once in an age, and of &s;uch a remarkable make, can con&s;tantly breed un|ob&s;erved in this kingdom.</P>

<P>THE old <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> tortoi&s;e, that I have mentioned to you &s;o often, is become my property. I dug it out of it's winter dormitory in <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, when it was enough awakened to expre&s;s it's re&s;entments by hi&s;&s;ing; and, packing it in a box with earth, carried it eighty miles in po&s;t-chai&s;es. The rattle and hurry of the journey &s;o per|fectly rou&s;ed it that, when I turned it out on a border, it walked twice down to the bottom of my garden; however, in the even|ing, the weather being cold, it buried it&s;elf in the loo&s;e mould, and continues &s;till concealed.</P>
<P>As it will be under my eye, I &s;hall now have an opportunity of enlarging my ob&s;ervations on it's mode of life, and propen&s;ities; and perceive already that, towards the time of coming forth, it opens a breathing place in the ground near it's head, requiring, I conclude, a freer re&s;piration as it becomes more alive. This creature not only goes under the earth from the middle of <HI>November</HI> to the middle of <HI>April,</HI> but &s;leeps great part of the &s;ummer; for it goes to bed in the longe&s;t days at four in the afternoon, and often does not &s;tir in the morning till late. Be|&s;ides, it retires to re&s;t for every &s;hower; and does not move at all in wet days.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="278">
When one reflects on the &s;tate of this &s;trange being, it is a matter of wonder to find that Providence &s;hould be&s;tow &s;uch a profu&s;ion of days, &s;uch a &s;eeming wa&s;te of longevity, on a reptile that appears to reli&s;h it &s;o little as to &s;quander more than two thirds of it's exi&s;tence in a joyle&s;s &s;tupor, and be lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;ation for months together in the profounde&s;t of &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>While I was writing this letter, a moi&s;t and warm afternoon, with the thermometer at 50, brought forth troops of <HI>&s;hell-&s;nails;</HI> and, at the &s;ame juncture, the <HI>tortoi&s;e</HI> heaved up the mould and put out it's head; and the next morning came forth, as it were rai&s;ed from the dead; and walked about till four in the afternoon.

<P>I HAVE now read your mi&s;cellanies through with much care and &s;atisfaction; and am to return you my be&s;t thanks for the honour|able mention made in them of me as a naturali&s;t, which I wi&s;h I may de&s;erve.</P>
<P>In &s;ome former letters I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;u&s;picions that many of the hou&s;e-martins do not depart in the winter far from this village. I therefore determined to make &s;ome &s;earch about the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the hill, where I imagined they might &s;lumber out the uncomfortable months of winter. But &s;uppo&s;ing that the exami|nation would be made to the be&s;t advantage in the &s;pring, and ob&s;erving that no martins had appeared by the 11th of <HI>April</HI> la&s;t; on that day I employed &s;ome men to explore the &s;hrubs and cavi|ties of the &s;u&s;pected &s;pot. The per&s;ons took pains, but without any &s;ucce&s;s; however, a remarkable incident occurred in the mid&s;t of our pur&s;uit&mdash;while the labourers were at work a hou&s;e-martin, the fir&s;t that had been &s;een this year, came down the village in the &s;ight of &s;everal people, and went at once into a ne&s;t, where it &s;tayed a &s;hort time, and then flew over the hou&s;es; for &s;ome days after no martins were ob&s;erved, not till the 16th of <HI>April,</HI> and then only a pair. Martins in general were remarkably late this year.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t met with a circum&s;tance re&s;pecting &s;wifts, which furni&s;hes an exception to the whole tenor of my ob&s;ervations ever &s;ince I have be&s;towed any attention on that &s;pecies of hirun|dines. Our &s;wifts, in general, withdrew this year about the fir&s;t day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> all &s;ave one pair, which in two or three days was reduced to a &s;ingle bird. The per&s;everance of this individual made me &s;u&s;pect that the &s;tronge&s;t of motives, that of an attach|to her young, could alone occa&s;ion &s;o late a &s;tay. I watched therefore till the twenty-fourth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and then di&s;covered that, under the eaves of the church, &s;he attended upon two young, which were fledged, and now put out their white chins from a crevice. The&s;e remained till the twenty-&s;eventh, looking more alert every day, and &s;eeming to long to be on the wing. After this day they were mi&s;&s;ing at once; nor could I ever ob&s;erve them with their dam cour&s;ing round the church in the act of learning to fly, as the fir&s;t broods evidently do. On the thirty-fir&s;t I cau&s;ed the eaves to be &s;earched, but we found in the ne&s;t only two callow, dead, &s;tinking &s;wifts, on which a &s;econd ne&s;t had been formed. This double ne&s;t was full of the black &s;hining ca&s;es of the <HI>hippobo&s;cae hirundinis.</HI></P>
<P>The following remarks on this unu&s;ual incident are obvious. The fir&s;t is, that though it may be di&s;agreeable to &s;wifts to remain
<PB N="265" REF="281">
beyond the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> yet that they can &s;ub&s;i&s;t longer is undeniable. The &s;econd is, that this uncommon event, as it was owing to the lo&s;s of the fir&s;t brood, &s;o it corroborates my former remark, that &s;wifts breed regularly but once; &s;ince, was the contrary the ca&s;e, the occurrence above could neither be new nor rare.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have &s;ometimes known you make inquiries about &s;everal kinds of in&s;ects, I &s;hall here &s;end you an account of one &s;ort which I little expected to have found in this kingdom. I had often ob&s;erved that one particular part of a vine growing on the walls of my hou&s;e was covered in the autumn with a black du&s;t|like appearance, on which the flies fed eagerly; and that the &s;hoots and leaves thus affected did not thrive; nor did the fruit ripen. To this &s;ub&s;tance I applied my gla&s;&s;es; but could not di&s;cover that it had any thing to do with animal life, as I at fir&s;t expected: but, upon a clo&s;er examination behind the larger
<PB N="266" REF="282">
boughs, we were &s;urpri&s;ed to find that they were coated over with hu&s;ky &s;hells, from who&s;e &s;ides proceeded a cotton-like &s;ub&s;tance, &s;urrounding a multitude of eggs. This curious and uncommon production put me upon recollecting what I have heard and read concerning the <HI>coccus vitis viniferae</HI> of <HI>Linnaeus,</HI> which, in the &s;outh of <HI>Europe,</HI> infe&s;ts many vines, and is an horrid and loath&s;ome pe&s;t. As &s;oon as I had turned to the accounts given of this in&s;ect, I &s;aw at once that it &s;warmed on my vine; and did not appear to have been at all checked by the preceding winter, which had been un|commonly &s;evere.</P>
<P>Not being then at all aware that it had any thing to do with <HI>England,</HI> I was much inclined to think that it came from <HI>Gibraltar</HI> among the many boxes and packages of plants and birds which I had formerly received from thence; and e&s;pecially as the vine infe&s;ted grew immediately under my &s;tudy-window, where I u&s;ually kept my &s;pecimens. True it is that I had received nothing from thence for &s;ome years: but as in&s;ects, we know, are con|veyed from one country to another in a very unexpected manner, and have a wonderful power of maintaining their exi&s;tence till they fall into a <HI>nidus</HI> proper for their &s;upport and increa&s;e, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect &s;till that the&s;e <HI>cocei</HI> came to me originally from <HI>Andalu&s;ia.</HI> Yet, all the while, candour obliges me to confe&s;s that Mr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> has written me word that he once, and but once, &s;aw the&s;e in&s;ects on a vine at <HI>Weymouth</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire;</HI> which, it is here to be ob&s;erved, is a &s;ea-port town to which the <HI>coccus</HI> might be conveyed by &s;hipping.</P>
<P>As many of my readers may po&s;&s;ibly never have heard of this &s;trange and unu&s;ual in&s;ect, I &s;hall here tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from a natural hi&s;tory of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> written by the Reverend <HI>John White,</HI> late vicar of <HI>Blackburn</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> but not yet publi&s;hed:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="283"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the year 1770 a vine, which grew on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of my hou&s;e, and which had produced the fine&s;t crops of grapes for years pa&s;t, was &s;uddenly over&s;pread on all the woody branches with large lumps of a white fibrous &s;ub&s;tance re&s;embling &s;piders webs, or rather raw cotton. It was of a very clammy quality, &s;ticking fa&s;t to every thing that touched it, and capable of being &s;pun into long threads. At fir&s;t I &s;u&s;pected it to be the product of &s;piders, but could find none. Nothing was to be &s;een con|nected with it but many <HI>brown oval hu&s;ky &s;hells,</HI> which by no means looked like in&s;ects, but rather re&s;embled bits of the dry bark of the vine. The tree had a plentiful crop of grapes &s;et, when this pe&s;t appeared upon it; but the fruit was manife&s;tly injured by this foul incumbrance. It remained all the &s;ummer, &s;till increa&s;ing, and loaded the woody and bearing branches to a va&s;t degree. I often pulled off great quantities by handfuls; but it was &s;o &s;limy and tenacious that it could by no means be cleared. The grapes never filled to their natural perfection, but turned watery and vapid. Upon peru&s;ing the works after|wards of M. de <HI>Reaumur,</HI> I found this matter perfectly de&s;cribed and accounted for. Tho&s;e hu&s;ky &s;hells, which I had ob&s;erved, were no other than the <HI>female coccus,</HI> from who&s;e &s;ides this cotton-like &s;ub&s;tance ex&s;udes, and &s;erves as a covering and &s;ecurity for their eggs."</Q></P>
<P>To this account I think proper to add, that, though the female <HI>cocci</HI> are &s;tationary, and &s;eldom remove from the place to which they &s;tick, yet the male is a winged in&s;ect; and that the black du&s;t which I &s;aw was undoubtedly the excrement of the females, which is eaten by ants as well as flies. Though the utmo&s;t &s;everity of our winter did not de&s;troy the&s;e in&s;ects, yet the attention of the gardener in a &s;ummer or two has entirely relieved my vine from this filthy annoyance.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="284">
As we have remarked above that in&s;ects are often conveyed from one country to another in a very unaccountable manner, I &s;hall here mention an emigration of &s;mall <HI>aphides,</HI> which was ob&s;erved in the village of <HI>Selborne</HI> no longer ago than <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 1&s;t, 1785.</P>
<P>At about three o'clock in the afternoon of that day, which was very hot, the people of this village were &s;urpri&s;ed by a &s;hower of <HI>aphides,</HI> or <HI>&s;mother-flies,</HI> which fell in the&s;e parts. Tho&s;e that were walking in the &s;treet at that juncture found them&s;elves covered with the&s;e in&s;ects, which &s;ettled al&s;o on the hedges and gardens, blackening all the vegetables where they alighted. My annuals were di&s;coloured with them, and the &s;talks of a bed of onions were quite coated over for &s;ix days after. The&s;e armies were then, no doubt, in a &s;tate of emigration, and &s;hifting their quarters; and might have come, as far as we know, from the great hop-plantations of <HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> the wind being all that day in the ea&s;terly quarter. They were ob&s;erved at the &s;ame time in great clouds about <HI>Farnham,</HI> and all along the vale from <HI>Farnham</HI> to <HI>Alton</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">For various methods by which &s;everal in&s;ects &s;hift their quarters, &s;ee <HI>Derham</HI>'s Phy&s;ico-Theology.</NOTE>.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I happen to vi&s;it a family where <HI>gold</HI> and <HI>&s;ilver fi&s;hes</HI> are kept in a gla&s;s bowl, I am always plea&s;ed with the occurrence, becau&s;e it offers me an opportunity of ob&s;erving the actions and propen&s;ities of tho&s;e beings with whom we can be little acquainted in their natural &s;tate. Not long &s;ince I &s;pent a fortnight at the hou&s;e of a friend where there was &s;uch a <HI>vivary,</HI> to which I paid no &s;mall attention, taking every occa&s;ion to remark what pa&s;&s;ed within it's narrow limits. It was here that I fir&s;t ob&s;erved the manner in which fi&s;hes die. As &s;oon as the creature &s;ickens, the head &s;inks lower and lower, and it &s;tands as it were on it's head; till, getting weaker, and lo&s;ing all poi&s;e, the tail turns over, and at la&s;t it floats on the &s;urface of the water with it's belly uppermo&s;t. The rea&s;on why fi&s;hes, when dead, &s;wim in that manner is very obvious; becau&s;e, when the body is no longer balanced by the fins of the belly, the broad mu&s;cular back preponderates by it's own gravity, and turns the belly uppermo&s;t, as lighter from it's being a cavity, and becau&s;e it contains the &s;wimming-bladders, which contribute to render it buoyant. Some that delight in <HI>gold</HI> and <HI>&s;ilver fi&s;hes</HI> have adopted a notion that they need no aliment. True it is that they will &s;ub&s;i&s;t for a long time without any apparent food but what they can collect from pure water frequently changed; yet they mu&s;t draw &s;ome &s;upport from animalcula, and other
<PB N="270" REF="286">
nouri&s;hment &s;upplied by the water; becau&s;e, though they &s;eem to eat nothing, yet the con&s;equences of eating often drop from them. That they are be&s;t plea&s;ed with &s;uch <HI>jejune</HI> diet may ea&s;ily be confuted, &s;ince if you to&s;s them crumbs they will &s;eize them with great readine&s;s, not to &s;ay greedine&s;s: however, bread &s;hould be given &s;paringly, le&s;t, turning &s;our, it corrupt the water. They will al&s;o feed on the water-plant called <HI>lemna (duck's meat),</HI> and al&s;o on &s;mall fry.</P>
<P>When they want to move a little they gently protrude them&s;elves with their <HI>pinnae pectorales;</HI> but it is with their &s;trong mu&s;cular tails only that they and all fi&s;hes &s;hoot along with &s;uch inconceivable rapidity. It has been &s;aid that the eyes of fi&s;hes are immoveable: but the&s;e apparently turn them forward or backward in their &s;ockets as their occa&s;ions require. They take little notice of a lighted candle, though applied clo&s;e to their heads, but flounce and &s;eem much frightened by a &s;udden &s;troke of the hand again&s;t the &s;upport whereon the bowl is hung; e&s;pecially when they have been motionle&s;s, and are perhaps a&s;leep. As fi&s;hes have no eye|lids, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cern when they are &s;leeping or not, be|cau&s;e their eyes are always open.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more amu&s;ing than a gla&s;s bowl containing &s;uch fi&s;hes: the double refractions of the gla&s;s and water repre&s;ent them, when moving, in a &s;hifting and changeable variety of dimen&s;ions, &s;hades, and colours; while the two mediums, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the concavo-convex &s;hape of the ve&s;&s;el, magnify and di&s;tort them va&s;tly; not to mention that the introduction of another element and it's inhabitants into our parlours engages the fancy in a very agreeable manner.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="287">
<HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>&s;ilver fi&s;hes,</HI> though originally natives of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> yet are become &s;o well reconciled to our climate as to thrive and multiply very fa&s;t in our ponds and &s;tews. <HI>Linnaeus</HI> ranks this &s;pecies of fi&s;h under the genus of <HI>cyprinus,</HI> or <HI>carp,</HI> and calls it <HI>cyprinus auratus.</HI></P>
<P>Some people exhibit this &s;ort of fi&s;h in a very fanciful way; for they cau&s;e a gla&s;s bowl to be blown with a large hollow &s;pace within, that does not communicate with it. In this cavity they put a bird occa&s;ionally; &s;o that you may &s;ee a goldfinch or a linnet hopping as it were in the mid&s;t of the water, and the fi&s;hes &s;wimming in a circle round it. The &s;imple exhibition of the fi&s;hes is agreeable and plea&s;ant; but in &s;o complicated a way becomes whim&s;ical and unnatural, and liable to the objection due to him,

<HEAD>LETTER LV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>October 10, 1781.</DATE></DATELINE><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK I have ob&s;erved before that much the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the <HI>hou&s;e-martins</HI> withdraw from hence about the fir&s;t week in <HI>October;</HI> but that &s;ome, the latter broods I am now convinced, linger on till towards the middle of that month: and that at times, once perhaps in two or three years, a flight, for one day only, has &s;hown it&s;elf in the fir&s;t week in <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>Having taken notice, in <HI>October</HI> 1780, that the la&s;t flight was numerous, amounting perhaps to one hundred and fifty; and that the &s;ea&s;on was &s;oft and &s;till; I was re&s;olved to pay uncommon attention to the&s;e late birds; to find, if po&s;&s;ible, where they roo&s;t|ed, and to determine the preci&s;e time of their retreat. The mode of life of the&s;e latter <HI>hirundines</HI> is very favourable to &s;uch a de&s;ign; for they &s;pend the whole day in the &s;heltered di&s;trict, between me and the <HI>Hanger,</HI> &s;ailing about in a placid, ea&s;y manner, and fea&s;ting on tho&s;e in&s;ects which love to haunt a &s;pot &s;o &s;ecure from ruffling winds. As my principal object was to di&s;|cover the place of their roo&s;ting, I took care to wait on them before they retired to re&s;t, and was much plea&s;ed to find that, for &s;everal evenings together, ju&s;t at a quarter pa&s;t five in the afternoon, they all &s;cudded away in great ha&s;te towards the &s;outh|ea&s;t, and darted down among the low &s;hrubs above the cottages at the end of the hill. This &s;pot in many re&s;pects &s;eems to be well calculated for their winter re&s;idence: for in many parts it is as
<PB N="273" REF="289">
&s;teep as the roof of any hou&s;e, and therefore &s;ecure from the annoyances of water; and it is moreover clothed with beechen &s;hrubs, which, being &s;tunted and bitten by &s;heep, make the thicke&s;t covert imaginable; and are &s;o entangled as to be impervious to the &s;malle&s;t &s;paniel: be&s;ides, it is the nature of underwood beech never to ca&s;t it's leaf all the winter; &s;o that, with the leaves on the ground and tho&s;e on the twigs, no &s;helter can be more com|plete. I watched them on to the thirteenth and fourteenth of <HI>October,</HI> and found their evening retreat was exact and uniform; but after this they made no regular appearance. Now and then a &s;traggler was &s;een; and, on the twenty-&s;econd of <HI>October,</HI> I ob&s;erved two in the morning over the village, and with them my remarks for the &s;ea&s;on ended.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances put together, it is more than pro|bable that this lingering flight, at &s;o late a &s;ea&s;on of the year, never departed from the i&s;land. Had they indulged me that autumn with a <HI>November</HI> vi&s;it, as I much de&s;ired, I pre&s;ume that, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tants, I &s;hould have &s;ettled the matter pa&s;t all doubt; but though the third of <HI>November</HI> was a &s;weet day, and in appear|ance exactly &s;uited to my wi&s;hes, yet not a martin was to be &s;een; and &s;o I was forced, reluctantly, to give up the pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>I have only to add that were the bu&s;hes, which cover &s;ome acres, and are not my own property, to be grubbed and carefully examined, probably tho&s;e late broods, and perhaps the whole aggregate body of the hou&s;e-martins of this di&s;trict, might be found there, in different &s;ecret dormitories; and that, &s;o far from withdrawing into warmer climes, it would appear that they never depart three hundred yards from the village.</P>

<P>THEY who write on natural hi&s;tory cannot too frequently advert to <HI>in&s;tinct,</HI> that wonderful limited faculty, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, rai&s;es the brute creation as it were above <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and in others leaves them &s;o far below it. Philo&s;ophers have defined <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> to be that &s;ecret influence by which every &s;pecies is impelled naturally to pur&s;ue, at all times, the &s;ame way or track, without any teach|ing or example; whereas <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> without in&s;truction, would often vary and do that by many methods which <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> effects by one alone. Now this maxim mu&s;t be taken in a qualified &s;en&s;e; for there are in&s;tances in which <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> does vary and conform to the circum&s;tances of place and convenience.</P>
<P>It has been remarked that every &s;pecies of bird has a mode of nidification peculiar to it&s;elf; &s;o that a &s;chool-boy would at once pronounce on the &s;ort of ne&s;t before him. This is the ca&s;e among fields and woods, and wilds; but, in the villages round <HI>London,</HI> where mo&s;&s;es and go&s;&s;amer, and cotton from vegetables, are hardly to be found, the ne&s;t of the <HI>chaffinch</HI> has not that elegant fini&s;hed appearance, nor is it &s;o beautifully &s;tudded with lichens, as in a more rural di&s;trict: and the <HI>wren</HI> is obliged to con&s;truct it's hou&s;e with &s;traws and dry gra&s;&s;es, which do not give it that rotundity and compactne&s;s &s;o remarkable in the edifices of that little architect. Again, the regular ne&s;t of the <HI>hou&s;e-martin</HI> is
<PB N="275" REF="291">
hemi&s;pheric; but where a rafter, or a joi&s;t, or a cornice, may happen to &s;tand in the way, the ne&s;t is &s;o contrived as to conform to the ob&s;truction, and becomes flat or oval, or compre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the following in&s;tances <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> is perfectly uniform and con|&s;i&s;tent. There are three creatures, the <HI>&s;quirrel,</HI> the <HI>field-mou&s;e,</HI> and the bird called the <HI>nut-batch, (&s;itta Europaea),</HI> which live much on hazle|nuts; and yet they open them each in a different way. The fir&s;t, after ra&s;ping off the &s;mall end, &s;plits the &s;hell in two with his long fore-teeth, as a man does with his knife; the &s;econd nibbles a hole with his teeth, &s;o regular as if drilled with a wimble, and yet &s;o &s;mall that one would wonder how the kernel can be extracted through it; while the la&s;t picks an irregular ragged hole with it's bill: but as this arti&s;t has no paws to hold the nut firm while he pierces it, like an adroit workman, he fixes it, as it were in a vice, in &s;ome cleft of a tree, or in &s;ome crevice; when, &s;tanding over it, he perforates the &s;tubborn &s;hell. We have often placed nuts in the chink of a gate-po&s;t where <HI>nut-hatches</HI> have been known to haunt, and have always found that tho&s;e birds have readily pene|trated them. While at work they make a rapping noi&s;e that may be heard at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.</P>
<P>You that under&s;tand both the theory and practical part of mu&s;ic may be&s;t inform us why <HI>harmony</HI> or <HI>melody</HI> &s;hould &s;o &s;trangely affect &s;ome men, as it were by recollection, for days after a concert is over.

<P>A RARE, and I think a new, little bird frequents my garden, which I have great rea&s;on to think is the <HI>pettichaps:</HI> it is common in &s;ome parts of the kingdom; and I have received formerly &s;everal dead &s;pecimens from <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> This bird much re&s;embles the <HI>white-throat,</HI> but has a more white or rather &s;ilvery brea&s;t and belly; is re&s;tle&s;s and active, like the <HI>willow-wrens,</HI> and hops from bough to bough, examining every part for food; it al&s;o runs up the &s;tems of the <HI>crown-imperials,</HI> and, putting it's head into the bells of tho&s;e flowers, &s;ips the liquor which &s;tands in the <HI>nectarium</HI> of each petal. Sometimes it feeds on the ground like the <HI>hedge-&s;parrow,</HI> by hopping about on the gra&s;s-plots and mown walks.</P>
<P>One of my neighbours, an intelligent and ob&s;erving man, in|forms me that, in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> and about ten minutes before eight o'clock in the evening, he di&s;covered a great clu&s;ter of <HI>hou&s;e-&s;wallows,</HI> thirty at lea&s;t he &s;uppo&s;es, perching on a willow that hung over the verge of <HI>James Knight</HI>'s upper-pond. His attention was fir&s;t drawn by the twittering of the&s;e birds, which &s;at motionle&s;s in a row on the bough, with their heads all one way, and, by their weight, pre&s;&s;ing down the twig &s;o that it nearly touched the water. In this &s;ituation he watched them till he could &s;ee no longer. Repeated accounts of this &s;ort, &s;pring and fall, induce us greatly to &s;u&s;pect that <HI>hou&s;e-&s;wallows</HI> have &s;ome &s;trong
<PB N="278" REF="294">
attachment to water, independent of the matter of food; and, though they may not retire into that element, yet they may con|ceal them&s;elves in the banks of pools and rivers during the uncom|fortable months of winter.</P>
<P>One of the keepers of <HI>Woolmer-fore&s;t</HI> &s;ent me a <HI>peregrine-falcon,</HI> which he &s;hot on the verge of that di&s;trict as it was devouring a wood-pigeon. The <HI>falco peregrinus,</HI> or <HI>haggard falcon,</HI> is a noble &s;pecies of hawk &s;eldom &s;een in the &s;outhern counties. In winter 1767 one was killed in the neighbouring pari&s;h of <HI>Faringdon,</HI> and &s;ent by me to Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> into <HI>North-Wales</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See my tenth and eleventh letter to that gentleman.</NOTE>. Since that time I have met with none till now. The &s;pecimen mentioned above was in fine pre&s;ervation, and not injured by the &s;hot: it mea&s;ured forty-two inches from wing to wing, and twenty-one from beak to tail, and weighed two pounds and an half &s;tanding weight. This &s;pecies is very robu&s;t, and wonderfully formed for rapine: it's brea&s;t was plump and mu&s;cular; it's thighs long, thick, and brawny; and it's legs remarkably &s;hort and well &s;et: the feet were armed with mo&s;t formidable, &s;harp, long talons: the eye|lids and cere of the bill were yellow; but the irides of the eyes du&s;ky; the beak was thick and hooked, and of a dark colour, and had a jagged proce&s;s near the end of the upper mandible on each &s;ide: it's tail, or train, was &s;hort in proportion to the bulk of it's body: yet the wings, when clo&s;ed, did not extend to the end of the train. From it's large and fair proportions it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a female; but I was not permitted to cut open the &s;pecimen. For one of the birds of prey, which are u&s;ually lean, this was in high ca&s;e: in it's craw were many barley|corns, which probably came from the crop of the wood-pigeon, on
<PB N="279" REF="295">
which it was feeding when &s;hot: for voracious birds do not eat grain; but, when devouring their quarry, with undi&s;tingui&s;hing vehemence &s;wallow bones and feathers, and all matters, indi&s;|criminately. This falcon was probably driven from the mountains of <HI>North Wales</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they are known to breed, by rigorous weather and deep &s;nows that had lately fallen.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>MY near neighbour, a young gentleman in the &s;ervice of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, has brought home a dog and a bitch of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> breed from <HI>Canton;</HI> &s;uch as are fattened in that country for the purpo&s;e of being eaten: they are about the &s;ize of a moderate &s;paniel; of a pale yellow colour, with coar&s;e bri&s;tling hairs on their backs; &s;harp upright ears, and peaked heads, which give them a very fox-like appearance. Their hind legs are unu&s;ually &s;traight, without any bend at the hock or ham, to &s;uch a degree as to give them an aukward gait when they trot. When they are in motion their tails are curved high over their backs like tho&s;e of &s;ome hounds, and have a bare place each on the out&s;ide from the tip midway, that does not &s;eem to be matter of
<PB N="280" REF="296">
accident, but &s;omewhat &s;ingular. Their eyes are jet-black, &s;mall, and piercing; the in&s;ides of their lips and mouths of the &s;ame colour, and their tongues blue. The bitch has a dew-claw on each hind leg; the dog has none. When taken out into a field the bitch &s;howed &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition for hunting, and dwelt on the &s;cent of a covey of partridges till &s;he &s;prung them, giving her tongue all the time. The dogs in <HI>South America</HI> are dumb; but the&s;e bark much in a &s;hort thick manner, like foxes; and have a &s;urly, &s;avage demeanour like their ance&s;tors, which are not dome&s;ticated, but bred up in &s;ties, where they are fed for the table with rice-meal and other farinaceous food. The&s;e dogs, having been taken on board as &s;oon as weaned, could not learn much from their dam; yet they did not reli&s;h fle&s;h when they came to <HI>England.</HI> In the i&s;lands of the <HI>pacific</HI> ocean the dogs are bred up on vegetables, and would not eat fle&s;h when offered them by our circumnavigators.</P>
<P>We believe that all dogs, in a &s;tate of nature, have &s;harp, upright fox-like ears; and that hanging ears, which are e&s;teemed &s;o graceful, are the effect of choice breeding and cultivation. Thus, in the Travels of <HI>Y&s;brandt Ides</HI> from <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> to <HI>China,</HI> the dogs which draw the <HI>Tartars</HI> on &s;now-&s;ledges near the river <HI>Oby</HI> are engraved with prick-ears, like tho&s;e from <HI>Canton.</HI> The <HI>Kam&s;chat|dales</HI> al&s;o train the &s;ame &s;ort of &s;harp-eared peak-no&s;ed dogs to draw their &s;ledges; as may be &s;een in an elegant print engraved for Captain <HI>Cook</HI>'s la&s;t voyage round the world.</P>
<P>Now we are upon the &s;ubject of dogs, it may not be impertinent to add, that &s;paniels, as all &s;por&s;men know, though they hunt partridges and phea&s;ants as it were by in&s;tinct, and with much delight and alacrity, yet will hardly touch their bones when offered as food; nor will a mongrel dog of my own, though he
<PB N="281" REF="297">
is remarkable for finding that &s;ort of game. But, when we came to offer the bones of partridges to the two <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> dogs, they de|voured them with much greedine&s;s, and licked the platter clean.</P>
<P>No &s;porting dogs will flu&s;h woodcocks till inured to the &s;cent and trained to the &s;port, which they then pur&s;ue with vehemence and tran&s;port; but then they will not touch their bones, but turn from them with abhorrence, even when they are hungry.</P>
<P>Now, that dogs &s;hould not be fond of the bones of &s;uch birds as they are not di&s;po&s;ed to hunt is no wonder; but why they reject and do not care to eat their natural game is not &s;o ea&s;ily accounted for, &s;ince the end of hunting &s;eems to be, that the cha&s;e pur&s;ued &s;hould be eaten. Dogs again will not devour the more rancid water-fowls, nor indeed the bones of any wild-fowls; nor will they touch the foetid bodies of birds that feed on offal and garbage: and indeed there may be &s;omewhat of providential in&s;tinct in this circum&s;tance of di&s;like; for vultures<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ha&s;&s;elqui&s;t,</HI> in his Travels to the <HI>Levant,</HI> ob&s;erves that the dogs and vultures at <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> maintain &s;uch a friendly intercour&s;e as to bring up their young together in the &s;ame place.</NOTE>, and kites, and ravens, and crows, &amp;c. were intended to be me&s;&s;mates with dogs<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> word for a dog to an <HI>European</HI> ear &s;ounds like <HI>quihloh.</HI></NOTE> over their carrion; and &s;eem to be appointed by Nature as fellow-&s;cavengers to remove all cadaverous nui&s;ances from the face of the earth.</P>

<P>THE fo&s;&s;il wood buried in the bogs of <HI>Wolmer-fore&s;t</HI> is not yet all exhau&s;ted; for the peat-cutters now and then &s;tumble upon a log. I have ju&s;t &s;een a piece which was &s;ent by a labourer of <HI>Oakhanger</HI> to a carpenter of this village; this was the but-end of a &s;mall oak, about five feet long, and about five inches in diameter. It had apparently been &s;evered from the ground by an axe, was very ponderous, and as black as ebony. Upon a&s;king the carpenter for what purpo&s;e he had procured it; he told me that it was to be &s;ent to his brother, a joiner at <HI>Farnham,</HI> who was to make u&s;e of it in cabinet work, by inlaying it along with whiter woods.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are much abroad on evenings after it is dark, in &s;pring and &s;ummer, frequently hear a nocturnal bird pa&s;&s;ing by on the wing, and repeating often a &s;hort quick note.

I am a&s;&s;ured now that it is the <HI>Stone-curlew, (charadrius oedicnemus).</HI> Some of them pa&s;s over or near my hou&s;e almo&s;t every evening after it is dark, from the uplands of the hill and <HI>North field,</HI> away down towards <HI>Dorton;</HI> where, among the &s;treams and meadows, they find a greater plenty of food. Birds that fly by night are obliged to be noi&s;y; their notes often repeated become &s;ignals or watch-words to keep them together, that they may not &s;tray or lo&s;e each the other in the dark.</P>

The evening proceedings and manoeuvres of the rooks are cu|rious and amu&s;ing in the autumn.

<P>IN reading Dr. <HI>Huxham's Ob&s;ervationes de Ae~re,</HI> &amp;c. written at <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> I find by tho&s;e curious and accurate remarks, which con|tain an account of the weather from the year 1727 to the year 1748, inclu&s;ive, that though there is frequent rain in that di&s;trict of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> yet the quantity falling is not great; and that &s;ome years it has been very &s;mall: for in 1731 the rain mea&s;ured only 17^i^n^c^h.&mdash;266^t^h^o^u. and in 1741, 20&mdash;354; and again, in 1743 only 20&mdash;908. Places near the &s;ea have frequent &s;cuds, that keep the atmo&s;phere moi&s;t, yet do not reach far up into the country; making thus the maritime &s;ituations appear wet, when the rain is not con&s;iderable. In the wette&s;t years at <HI>Plymouth</HI> the Doctor mea&s;ured only once 36; and again once, viz. 1734, 37&mdash;114: a quantity of rain that has twice been exceeded at <HI>Selborne</HI> in the &s;hort period of my ob&s;ervations. Dr. <HI>Huxham</HI> remarks that fre|quent &s;mall rains keep the air moi&s;t; while heavy ones render it more dry, by beating down the vapours. He is al&s;o of opinion that the <HI>dingy, &s;moky appearance</HI> in the &s;ky, in very dry &s;ea&s;ons, ari&s;es from the want of moi&s;ture &s;ufficient to let the light through, and render the atmo&s;phere tran&s;parent; becau&s;e he had ob&s;erved &s;everal bodies more diaphanous when wet than dry; and did never recollect that the air had that look in rainy &s;ea&s;ons.</P>

My friend, who lives ju&s;t beyond the top of the down, brought his three &s;wivel guns to try them in my outlet, with their muzzles towards the <HI>Hanger,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that the report would have had a great effect; but the experiment did not an&s;wer his expectation. He then removed them to the <HI>Alcove</HI> on the <HI>Hanger;</HI> when the &s;ound, ru&s;hing along the <HI>Lythe</HI> and <HI>Comb-wood,</HI> was very grand: but it was at the <HI>Hermitage</HI> that the echoes and repercu&s;&s;ions de|lighted the hearers; not only filling the <HI>Lythe</HI> with the roar, as if all the beeches were tearing up by the roots; but, turning to the left, they pervaded the vale above <HI>Combwood-ponds;</HI> and after a pau&s;e &s;eemed to take up the cra&s;h again, and to extend round <HI>Harteley-hangers,</HI> and to die away at la&s;t among the coppices and coverts of <HI>Ward-le-ham.</HI> It has been remarked before that this di&s;trict is an <HI>anathoth,</HI> a place of re&s;pon&s;es or echoes, and there|fore proper for &s;uch experiments: we may farther add that the pau&s;es in echoes, when they cea&s;e and yet are taken up again, like the pau&s;es in mu&s;ic, &s;urpri&s;e the hearers, and have a fine effect on the imagination.</P>
<P>The gentleman abovementioned has ju&s;t fixed a barometer in his parlour at <HI>Newton Valence.</HI> The tube was fir&s;t filled here (at <HI>Selborne</HI>) twice with care, when the mercury agreed and &s;tood exactly with my own; but, being filled again twice at <HI>Newton,</HI> the mercury &s;tood, on account of the great elevation of that hou&s;e, three-tenths of an inch lower than the barometers at this village, and &s;o continues to do, be the weight of the atmo&s;phere what it may. The plate of the barometer at <HI>Newton</HI> is figured as low as 27; becau&s;e in &s;tormy weather the mercury there will &s;ome|times de&s;cend below 28.

<P>SINCE the weather of a di&s;trict is undoubtedly part of it's natural hi&s;tory, I &s;hall make no further apology for the four following letters, which will contain many particulars concerning &s;ome of the great fro&s;ts and a few re&s;pecting &s;ome very hot &s;ummers, that have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the re&s;t during the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>As the fro&s;t in <HI>January</HI> 1768 was, for the &s;mall time it la&s;ted, the mo&s;t &s;evere that we had then known for many years, and was remarkably injurious to ever-greens, &s;ome account of it's rigour, and rea&s;on of it's ravages, may be u&s;eful, and not unacceptable to per&s;ons that delight in planting and ornamenting; and may particularly become a work that profe&s;&s;es never to lo&s;e &s;ight of utility.</P>
<P>For the la&s;t two or three days of the former year there were con&s;iderable falls of &s;now, which lay deep and uniform on the ground without any drifting, wrapping up the more humble vegetation in perfect &s;ecurity. From the fir&s;t day to the fifth of the new year more &s;now &s;ucceeded; but from that day the air became entirely clear; and the heat of the &s;un about noon had a con&s;iderable influence in &s;heltered &s;ituations.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="304">
It was in &s;uch an a&s;pect that the &s;now on the author's ever|greens was melted every day, and frozen inten&s;ely every night; &s;o that the lauru&s;tines, bays, laurels, and arbutu&s;es looked, in three or four days, as if they had been burnt in the fire; while a neigh|bour's plantation of the &s;ame kind, in a high cold &s;ituation, where the &s;now was never melted at all, remained uninjured.</P>
<P>From hence I would infer that it is the repeated melting and freezing of the &s;now that is &s;o fatal to vegetation, rather than the &s;everity of the cold. Therefore it highly behoves every planter, who wi&s;hes to e&s;cape the cruel mortification of lo&s;ing in a few days the labour and hopes of years, to be&s;tir him&s;elf on &s;uch emer|gencies; and, if his plantations are &s;mall, to avail him&s;elf of mats, cloths, pea&s;e-haum, &s;traw, reeds, or any &s;uch covering, for a &s;hort time; or, if his &s;hrubberies are exten&s;ive, to &s;ee that his people go about with prongs and forks, and carefully di&s;lodge the &s;now from the boughs: &s;ince the naked foliage will &s;hift much better for it&s;elf, than where the &s;now is partly melted and frozen again.</P>
<P>It may perhaps appear at fir&s;t like a paradox; but doubtle&s;s the more tender trees and &s;hrubs &s;hould never be planted in hot a&s;pects; not only for the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned above, but al&s;o becau&s;e, thus circum&s;tanced, they are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hoot earlier in the &s;pring, and to grow on later in the autumn, than they would otherwi&s;e do, and &s;o are &s;ufferers by lagging or early fro&s;ts. For this rea&s;on al&s;o plants from <HI>Siberia</HI> will hardly endure our climate; becau&s;e, on the very fir&s;t advances of &s;pring, they &s;hoot away, and &s;o are cut off by the &s;evere nights of <HI>March</HI> or <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Fothergill</HI> and others have experienced the &s;ame inconvenience with re&s;pect to the more tender &s;hrubs from <HI>North-America;</HI> which they therefore plant under north-walls. There &s;hould al&s;o perhaps
<PB N="289" REF="305">
be a wall to the ea&s;t to defend them from the piercing bla&s;ts from that quarter.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation might without any impropriety be carried into animal life; for di&s;cerning bee-ma&s;ters now find that their hives &s;hould not in the winter be expo&s;ed to the hot &s;un, becau&s;e &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable warmth awakens the inhabitants too early from their &s;lumbers; and, by putting their juices into motion too &s;oon, &s;ubjects them afterwards to inconveniencies when rigorous weather returns.</P>
<P>The coincidents attending this &s;hort but inten&s;e fro&s;t were, that the hor&s;es fell &s;ick with an epidemic di&s;temper, which injured the winds of many, and killed &s;ome; that colds and coughs were general among the human &s;pecies; that it froze under people's beds for &s;everal nights; that meat was &s;o hard frozen that it could not be &s;pitted, and could not be &s;ecured but in cellars; that &s;everal redwings and thru&s;hes were killed by the fro&s;t; and that the large titmou&s;e continued to pull &s;traws lengthwi&s;e from the eaves of thatched hou&s;es and barns in a mo&s;t adroit manner, for a purpo&s;e that has been explained already<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See Letter xli. to Mr. <HI>Pennant.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 3d of <HI>January Benjamin Martin</HI>'s thermometer within doors, in a clo&s;e parlour where there was no fire, fell in the night to 20, and on the 4th to 18, and on the 7th to 17&frac12;, a degree of cold which the owner never &s;ince &s;aw in the &s;ame &s;ituation; and he regrets much that he was not able at that juncture to attend his in&s;trument abroad. All this time the wind continued north and north-ea&s;t; and yet on the 8th roo&s;t-cocks, which had been &s;ilent, began to &s;ound their clarions, and crows to clamour, as progno&s;tic of milder weather; and, moreover, moles began to

heave and work, and a manife&s;t thaw took place. From the latter circum&s;tance we may conclude that thaws often originate under ground from warm vapours which ari&s;e; el&s;e how &s;hould &s;ubter|raneous animals receive &s;uch early intimations of their approach. Moreover, we have often ob&s;erved that cold &s;eems to de&s;cend from above; for, when a thermometer hangs abroad in a fro&s;ty night, the intervention of a cloud &s;hall immediately rai&s;e the mercury ten degrees; and a clear &s;ky &s;hall again compel it to de&s;cend to it's former gage.</P>
<P>And here it may be proper to ob&s;erve, on what has been &s;aid above, that though fro&s;ts advance to their utmo&s;t &s;everity by &s;ome|what of a regular gradation, yet thaws do not u&s;ually come on by as regular a declen&s;ion of cold; but often take place immediately from inten&s;e freezing; as men in &s;ickne&s;s often mend at once from a paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>To the great credit of <HI>Portugal</HI> laurels and <HI>American</HI> junipers, be it remembered that they remained untouched amid&s;t the general havock: hence men &s;hould learn to ornament chiefly with &s;uch trees as are able to with&s;tand accidental &s;everities, and not &s;ubject them&s;elves to the vexation of a lo&s;s which may befall them once perhaps in ten years, yet may hardly be recovered through the whole cour&s;e of their lives.</P>
<P>As it appeared afterwards the ilexes were much injured, the cypre&s;&s;es were half de&s;troyed, the arbutu&s;es lingered on, but never recovered; and the bays, lauru&s;tines, and laurels, were killed to the ground; and the very wild hollies, in hot a&s;pects, were &s;o much affected that they ca&s;t all their leaves.</P>
<P>By the 14th of <HI>January</HI> the &s;now was entirely gone; the turnips emerged not damaged at all, &s;ave in &s;unny places; the wheat looked delicately, and the garden plants were well pre&s;erved;

<P>THERE were &s;ome circum&s;tances attending the remarkable fro&s;t in <HI>January</HI> 1776 &s;o &s;ingular and &s;triking, that a &s;hort detail of them may not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t certain way to be exact will be to copy the pa&s;&s;ages from my journal, which were taken from time to time as things occurred. But it may be proper previou&s;ly to remark that the fir&s;t week in <HI>January</HI> was uncommonly wet, and drowned with va&s;t rains from every quarter: from whence may be inferred, as there is great rea&s;on to believe is the ca&s;e, that inten&s;e fro&s;ts &s;eldom take place till the earth is perfectly glutted and chilled with water<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">The autumn preceding <HI>January</HI> 1768 was very wet, and particularly the month of <HI>September,</HI> during which there fell at <HI>Lyndon,</HI> in the county of <HI>Rutland, &s;ix inches and an half</HI> of rain. And the terrible long fro&s;t in 1739-40 &s;et in after a rainy &s;ea&s;on, and when the &s;prings were very high.</NOTE>; and hence dry autumns are &s;eldom followed by rigorous winters.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="310">
<HI>January</HI> 7th.&mdash;Snow driving all the day, which was followed by fro&s;t, &s;leet, and &s;ome &s;now, till the 12th, when a prodigious ma&s;s overwhelmed all the works of men, drifting over the tops of the gates and filling the hollow lanes.</P>
<P>On the 14th the writer was obliged to be much abroad; and thinks he never before or &s;ince has encountered &s;uch rugged <HI>Siberian</HI> weather. Many of the narrow roads were now filled above the tops of the hedges; through which the &s;now was driven into mo&s;t romantic and grote&s;que &s;hapes, &s;o &s;triking to the imagi|nation as not to be &s;een without wonder and plea&s;ure. The poultry dared not to &s;tir out of their roo&s;ting places; for cocks and hens are &s;o dazzled and confounded by the glare of &s;now that they would &s;oon peri&s;h without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The hares al&s;o lay &s;ullenly in their &s;eats, and would not move till compelled by hunger; being con&s;cious, poor animals, that the drifts and heaps treacherou&s;ly betray their foot&s;teps, and prove fatal to numbers of them.</P>
<P>From the 14th the &s;now continued to increa&s;e, and began to &s;top the road waggons and coaches, which could no longer keep on their regular &s;tages; and e&s;pecially on the we&s;tern roads, where the fall appears to have been deeper than in the &s;outh. The company at <HI>Bath,</HI> that wanted to attend the <HI>Queen's birth-day,</HI> were &s;trangely incommoded: many carriages of per&s;ons, who got in their way to town from <HI>Bath</HI> as far as <HI>Marlborough,</HI> after &s;trange embarra&s;&s;ments, here met with a <HI>ne plus ultra.</HI> The ladies fretted, and offered large rewards to labourers if they would &s;hovel them a track to <HI>London:</HI> but the relentle&s;s heaps of &s;now were too bulky to be removed; and &s;o the 18th pa&s;&s;ed over, leaving the company in very uncomfortable circum&s;tances at the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> and other inns.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="311">
On the 20th the &s;un &s;hone out for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the fro&s;t began; a circum&s;tance that has been remarked before much in favour of vegetation. All this time the cold was not very inten&s;e, for the thermometer &s;tood at 29, 28, 25, and there|about; but on the 21&s;t it de&s;cended to 20. The birds now began to be in a very pitiable and &s;tarving condition. Tamed by the &s;ea&s;on, &s;ky-larks &s;ettled in the &s;treets of towns, becau&s;e they &s;aw the ground was bare; rooks frequented dunghills clo&s;e to hou&s;es; and crows watched hor&s;es as they pa&s;&s;ed, and greedily devoured what dropped from them; hares now came into men's gardens, and, &s;craping away the &s;now, devoured &s;uch plants as they could find.</P>
<P>On the 22d the author had occa&s;ion to go to <HI>London</HI> through a &s;ort of <HI>Laplandian-&s;cene,</HI> very wild and grote&s;que indeed. But the metropolis it&s;elf exhibited a &s;till more &s;ingular appearance than the country; for, being bedded deep in &s;now, the pavement of the &s;treets could not be touched by the wheels or the hor&s;es' feet, &s;o that the carriages ran about without the lea&s;t noi&s;e. Such an exemption from din and clatter was &s;trange, but not plea&s;ant; it &s;eemed to convey an uncomfortable idea of de&s;olation:

<P>On the 27th much &s;now fell all day, and in the evening the fro&s;t became very inten&s;e. At <HI>South Lambeth,</HI> &s;or the four following nights, the thermometer fell to 11, 7, 6, 6; and at <HI>Selborne</HI> to 7, 6, 10; and on the 31&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> ju&s;t before &s;un-ri&s;e, with rime on the trees and on the tube of the gla&s;s, the quick&s;ilver &s;unk exactly to zero, being 32 degrees below the freezing point: but by eleven in the morning, though in the

<P>The thermometer u&s;ed at <HI>Selborne</HI> was graduated by <HI>Benjamin Martin.</HI></P></NOTE>.&mdash;a mo&s;t unu&s;ual degree of cold this for the &s;outh of <HI>England!</HI> During the&s;e four nights the cold was &s;o penetrating that it occa&s;ioned ice in warm chambers and under beds; and in the day the wind was &s;o keen that per&s;ons of robu&s;t con&s;titutions could &s;carcely endure to face it. The <HI>Thames</HI> was at once &s;o frozen over both above and below bridge that crowds ran about on the ice. The &s;treets were now &s;trangely encumbered with &s;now, which crumbled and trod du&s;ty; and, turning grey, re|&s;embled bay-&s;alt: what had fallen on the roofs was &s;o perfectly dry that, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, it lay twenty-&s;ix days on the hou&s;es in the city; a longer time than had been remembered by the olde&s;t hou&s;ekeepers living. According to all appearances we might now have expected the continuance of this rigorous weather for weeks to come, &s;ince every night increa&s;ed in &s;everity; but be|hold, without any apparent cau&s;e, on the 1&s;t of <HI>February</HI> a thaw took place, and &s;ome rain followed before night; making good the ob&s;ervation above, that fro&s;ts often go off as it were at once, without any gradual declen&s;ion of cold. On the 2d of <HI>February</HI> the thaw per&s;i&s;ted; and on the 3d &s;warms of little in&s;ects were fri&s;king and &s;porting in a court-yard at <HI>South Lambeth,</HI> as if they had felt no fro&s;t. Why the juices in the &s;mall bodies and &s;maller limbs of &s;uch minute beings are not frozen is a matter of curious inquiry.</P>
<P>Severe fro&s;ts &s;eem to be partial, or to run in currents; for, at the &s;ame juncture, as the author was informed by accurate corre|&s;pondents,
<PB N="295" REF="313">
at <HI>Lyndon,</HI> in the county of <HI>Rutland,</HI> the thermometer &s;tood at 19; at <HI>Blackburn,</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> at 19; and at <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> at 21, 20, and 18. Thus does &s;ome unknown circum&s;tance &s;trangely overbalance latitude, and render the cold &s;ometimes much greater in the &s;outhern than the northern parts of this kingdom.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences of this &s;everity were, that in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> at the melting of the &s;now, the wheat looked well, and the turnips came forth little injured. The laurels and lauru&s;tines were &s;ome|what damaged, but only in <HI>hot a&s;pects.</HI> No evergreens were quite de&s;troyed; and not half the damage &s;u&s;tained that befell in <HI>January</HI> 1768. Tho&s;e laurels that were a little &s;corched on the &s;outh-&s;ides were perfectly untouched on their north-&s;ides. The care taken to &s;hake the &s;now day by day from the branches &s;eemed greatly to avail the author's evergreens. A neighbour's laurel|hedge, in a high &s;ituation, and facing to the north, was perfectly green and vigorous; and the <HI>Portugal laurels</HI> remained unhurt.</P>
<P>As to the birds, the thru&s;hes and blackbirds were mo&s;tly de|&s;troyed; and the partridges, by the weather and poachers, were &s;o thinned that few remained to breed the following year.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AS the fro&s;t in <HI>December</HI> 1784 was very extraordinary, you, I tru&s;t, will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to hear the particulars; and e&s;pecially when I promi&s;e to &s;ay no more about the &s;everities of winter after I have fini&s;hed this letter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t week in <HI>December</HI> was very wet, with the barometer very low. On the 7th, with the barometer at 28&mdash;five tenths, came on a va&s;t &s;now, which continued all that day and the next, and mo&s;t part of the following night; &s;o that by the morning of the 9th the works of men were quite overwhelmed, the lanes filled &s;o as to be impa&s;&s;able, and the ground covered twelve or fifteen inches without any drifting. In the evening of the 9th the air began to be &s;o very &s;harp that we thought it would be curious to attend to the motions of a thermometer: we therefore hung out two; one made by <HI>Martin</HI> and one by <HI>Dollond,</HI> which &s;oon began to &s;hew us what we were to expect; for, by ten o'clock, they fell to 21, and at eleven to 4, when we went to bed. On the 10th, in the morning, the quick&s;ilver of <HI>Dollond</HI>'s gla&s;s was down to <HI>half a degree below zero;</HI> and that of <HI>Martin</HI>'s, which was ab&s;urdly graduated only to four degrees <HI>above zero,</HI> &s;unk quite into the bra&s;s guard of the ball; &s;o that when the weather became mo&s;t intere&s;ting this was u&s;ele&s;s. On the 10th, at eleven at night, though the air was perfectly &s;till, <HI>Dollond</HI>'s gla&s;s went down
<PB N="297" REF="315">
to <HI>one degree below zero!</HI> This &s;trange &s;everity of the weather made me very de&s;irous to know what degree of cold there might be in &s;uch an exalted and near &s;ituation as <HI>Newton.</HI> We had therefore, on the morning of the 10th, written to Mr. &mdash;, and entreated him to hang out his thermometer, made by <HI>Adams;</HI> and to pay &s;ome attention to it morning and evening; expecting wonderful phaenomena, in &s;o elevated a region, at two hundred feet or more above my hou&s;e. But, behold! on the 10th, at eleven at night, it was down only to 17, and the next morning at 22, when mine was at ten! We were &s;o di&s;turbed at this unexpected rever&s;e of com|parative local cold, that we &s;ent one of my gla&s;&s;es up, thinking that of Mr. &mdash; mu&s;t, &s;ome how, be wrongly con&s;tructed. But, when the in&s;truments came to be confronted, they went exactly together: &s;o that, for one night at lea&s;t, the cold at <HI>Newton</HI> was 18 degrees le&s;s than at <HI>Selborne;</HI> and, through the whole fro&s;t, 10 or 12 degrees; and indeed, when we came to ob&s;erve con&s;equences, we could readily credit this; for all my lauru&s;tines, bays, ilexes, arbutu&s;es, cypre&s;&s;es, and even my <HI>Portugal laurels</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Miller,</HI> in his Gardener's Dictionary, &s;ays po&s;itively that the <HI>Portugal laurels</HI> re|mained untouched in the remarkable fro&s;t of 1739-40. So that either that accurate ob|&s;erver was much mi&s;taken, or el&s;e the fro&s;t of <HI>December</HI> 1784 was much more &s;evere and de&s;tructive than that in the year above mentioned.</NOTE>, and (which occa&s;ions more regret) my fine &s;loping laurel-hedge, were &s;corched up; while, at <HI>Newton,</HI> the &s;ame trees have not lo&s;t a leaf!</P>
<P>We had &s;teady fro&s;t on to the 25th, when the thermometer in the morning was down to 10 with us, and at <HI>Newton</HI> only to 21. Strong fro&s;t continued till the 31&s;t, when &s;ome tendency to thaw was ob&s;erved; and, by <HI>January</HI> the 3d, 1785, the thaw was con|firmed, and &s;ome rain fell.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="316">
A circum&s;tance that I mu&s;t not omit, becau&s;e it was new to us, is, that on <HI>Friday, December</HI> the 10th, being bright &s;un-&s;hine, the air was full of icy <HI>&s;piculae,</HI> floating in all directions, like atoms in a &s;un-beam let into a dark room. We thought them at fir&s;t particles of the rime falling from my tall hedges; but were &s;oon convinced to the contrary, by making our ob&s;ervations in open places where no rime could reach us. Were they watery particles of the air frozen as they floated; or were they evaporations from the &s;now frozen as they mounted?</P>
<P>We were much obliged to the thermometers for the early in|formation they gave us; and hurried our apples, pears, onions, potatoes, &amp;c. into the cellar, and warm clo&s;ets; while tho&s;e who had not, or neglected &s;uch warnings, lo&s;t all their &s;tore of roots and fruits, and had their very bread and chee&s;e frozen.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to tell you that, during tho&s;e two <HI>Siberian</HI> days, my parlour-cat was &s;o electric, that had a per&s;on &s;troked her, and been properly <HI>in&s;ulated,</HI> the &s;hock might have been given to a whole circle of people.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention before, that, during the two &s;evere days, two men, who were tracing hares in the &s;now, had their feet frozen; and two men, who were much better employed, had their fingers &s;o affected by the fro&s;t, while they were thra&s;hing in a barn, that a mortification followed, from which they did not recover for many weeks.</P>
<P>This fro&s;t killed all the furze and mo&s;t of the ivy, and in many places &s;tripped the hollies of all their leaves. It came at a very early time of the year, before old <HI>November</HI> ended; and yet may be allowed from it's effects to have exceeded any &s;ince 1739-40.</P>

<P>As the effects of heat are &s;eldom very remarkable in the northerly climate of <HI>England,</HI> where the &s;ummers are often &s;o defective in warmth and &s;un-&s;hine as not to ripen the fruits of the earth &s;o well as might be wi&s;hed, I &s;hall be more conci&s;e in my account of the &s;everity of a &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and &s;o make a little amends for the prolix account of the degrees of cold, and the inconveniences that we &s;uffered from &s;ome late rigorous winters.</P>
<P>The &s;ummers of 1781 and 1783 were unu&s;ually hot and dry; to them therefore I &s;hall turn back in my journals, without re|curring to any more di&s;tant period. In the former of the&s;e years my peach and nectarine-trees &s;uffered &s;o much from the heat that the rind on the bodies was &s;calded and came off; &s;ince which the trees have been in a decaying &s;tate. This may prove a hint to a&s;&s;iduous gardeners to fence and &s;helter their wall-trees with mats or boards, as they may ea&s;ily do, becau&s;e &s;uch annoyance is &s;eldom of long continuance. During that &s;ummer al&s;o, I ob&s;erved that my apples were coddled, as it were, on the trees; &s;o that they had no quickne&s;s of flavour, and would not keep in the winter. This circum&s;tance put me in mind of what I have heard travellers a&s;&s;ert, that they never ate a good apple or apricot in the &s;outh of <HI>Europe,</HI>
<PB N="300" REF="318">
where the heats were &s;o great as to render the juices vapid and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>The great pe&s;ts of a garden are wa&s;ps, which de&s;troy all the finer fruits ju&s;t as they are coming into perfection. In 1781 we had none; in 1783 there were myriads; which would have de|voured all the produce of my garden, had not we &s;et the boys to take the ne&s;ts, and caught thou&s;ands with hazel-twigs tipped with bird-lime: we have &s;ince employed the boys to take and de&s;troy the large breeding wa&s;ps in the &s;pring. Such expedients have a great effect on the&s;e marauders, and will keep them under. Though wa&s;ps do not abound but in hot &s;ummers, yet they do not prevail in every hot &s;ummer, as I have in&s;tanced in the two years above|mentioned.</P>
<P>In the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on of 1783 honey-dews were &s;o frequent as to deface and de&s;troy the beauties of my garden. My honey&s;uckles, which were one week the mo&s;t &s;weet and lovely objects that the eye could behold, became the next the mo&s;t loath&s;ome; being enveloped in a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance, and loaded with black aphides, or &s;mother-flies. The occa&s;ion of this clammy appearance &s;eems to be this, that in hot weather the effluvia of flowers in fields and meadows and gardens are drawn up in the day by a bri&s;k evapora|tion, and then in the night fall down again with the dews, in which they are entangled; that the air is &s;trongly &s;cented, and therefore impregnated with the particles of flowers in &s;ummer weather, our &s;en&s;es will inform us; and that this clammy &s;weet &s;ub&s;tance is of the vegetable kind we may learn from bees, to whom it is very grateful: and we may be a&s;&s;ured that it falls in the night, becau&s;e it is always fir&s;t &s;een in warm &s;till mornings.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="319">
On chalky and &s;andy &s;oils, and in the hot villages about <HI>London,</HI> the thermometer has been often ob&s;erved to mount as high as 83 or 84; but with us, in this hilly and woody di&s;trict, I have hardly ever &s;een it exceed 80; nor does it often arrive at that pitch. The rea&s;on, I conclude, is, that our den&s;e clayey &s;oil, &s;o much &s;haded by trees, is not &s;o ea&s;ily heated through as tho&s;e above|mentioned: and, be&s;ides, our mountains cau&s;e currents of air and breezes; and the va&s;t effluvia from our woodlands temper and moderate our heats.</P>

The &s;un, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and &s;hed a ru&s;t-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at ri&s;ing and &s;etting. All the time the heat was &s;o inten&s;e that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies &s;warmed &s;o in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the hor&s;es half frantic, and riding irk&s;ome.

<P>WE are very &s;eldom annoyed with thunder-&s;torms: and it is no le&s;s remarkable than true, that tho&s;e which ari&s;e in the &s;outh have hardly been known to reach this village; for, before they get over us, they take a direction to the ea&s;t or to the we&s;t, or &s;ometimes divide into two, and go in part to one of tho&s;e quarters, and in part to the other; as was truly the ca&s;e in &s;ummer 1783, when, though the country round was continually hara&s;&s;ed with tempe&s;ts, and often from the &s;outh, yet we e&s;caped them all; as appears by my journal of that &s;ummer. The only way that I can at all account for this fact&mdash;for &s;uch it is&mdash;is that, on that quarter, between us and the &s;ea, there are continual mountains, hill behind hill, &s;uch as <HI>Nore-hill,</HI> the <HI>Barnet, But&s;er-bill,</HI> and <HI>Ports-down,</HI> which &s;ome how divert the &s;torms, and give them a different direction. High promontories, and elevated grounds, have always been ob&s;erved to attract clouds and di&s;arm them of their mi&s;|chievous contents, which are di&s;charged into the trees and &s;ummits as &s;oon as they come in contact with tho&s;e turbulent meteors; while the humble vales e&s;cape, becau&s;e they are &s;o far beneath them.</P>
<P>But, when I &s;ay I do not remember a thunder-&s;torm from the &s;outh, I do not mean that we never have &s;uffered from thunder|&s;torms
<PB N="304" REF="322">
at all; for on <HI>June</HI> 5th, 1784, the thermometer in the morning being at 64, and at noon at 70, the barometer at 29&mdash;&s;ix tenths one-half, and the wind north, I ob&s;erved a blue mi&s;t, &s;melling &s;trongly of &s;ulphur, hanging along our &s;loping woods, and &s;eem|ing to indicate that thunder was at hand. I was called in about two in the afternoon, and &s;o mi&s;&s;ed &s;eeing the gathering of the clouds in the north; which they who were abroad a&s;&s;ured me had &s;ome|thing uncommon in it's appearance. At about a quarter after two the &s;torm began in the pari&s;h of <HI>Hartley,</HI> moving &s;lowly from north to &s;outh; and from thence it came over <HI>Norton-farm,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Grange-farm,</HI> both in this pari&s;h. It began with va&s;t drops of rain, which were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by round hail, and then by convex pieces of ice, which mea&s;ured three inches in girth. Had it been as exten&s;ive as it was violent, and of any continuance (for it was very &s;hort), it mu&s;t have ravaged all the neighbourhood. In the pari&s;h of <HI>Hartley</HI> it did &s;ome damage to one farm; but <HI>Norton,</HI> which lay in the center of the &s;torm, was greatly injured; as was <HI>Grange,</HI> which lay next to it. It did but ju&s;t reach to the middle of the village, where the hail broke my north windows, and all my garden-lights and hand-gla&s;&s;es, and many of my neigh|bours' windows. The extent of the &s;torm was about two miles in length and one in breadth. We were ju&s;t &s;itting down to dinner; but were &s;oon diverted from our repa&s;t by the clattering of tiles and the jingling of gla&s;s. There fell at the &s;ame time prodigious torrents of rain on the farms above-mentioned, which occa&s;ioned a flood as violent as it was &s;udden; doing great damage to the meadows and fallows, by deluging the one and wa&s;hing away the &s;oil of the other.

<P>Though the clouds at <HI>South Lambeth,</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> were at that juncture thin and light, and no &s;torm was in &s;ight, nor within hearing, yet the air was &s;trongly electric; for the bells of an electric machine at that place rang repeatedly, and fierce &s;parks were di&s;charged.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>IT is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that in remote ages this woody and mountainous di&s;trict was inhabited only by bears and wolves. Whether the <HI>Britons</HI> ever thought it worthy their attention, is not in our power to determine; but we may &s;afely conclude, from circum&s;tances, that it was not unknown to the <HI>Romans.</HI> Old people remember to have heard their fathers and grandfathers &s;ay that, in dry &s;ummers and in windy weather, pieces of money were &s;ome|times found round the verge of <HI>Woolmer-pond;</HI> and tradition had in&s;pired the fore&s;ters with a notion that the bottom of that lake contained great &s;tores of trea&s;ure. During the &s;pring and &s;ummer
<PB N="310" REF="326">
of 1740 there was little rain; and the following &s;ummer al&s;o, 1741, was &s;o uncommonly dry, that many &s;prings and ponds failed, and this lake in particular, who&s;e bed became as du&s;ty as the &s;urround|ing heaths and wa&s;tes. This favourable juncture induced &s;ome of the fore&s;t-cottagers to begin a &s;earch, which was attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that all the labourers in the neighbourhood flocked to the &s;pot, and with &s;pades and hoes turned up great part of that large area. In&s;tead of pots of coins, as they expected, they found great heaps, the one lying on the other, as if &s;hot out of a bag; many of which were in good pre&s;ervation. Silver and gold the&s;e inquirers expected to find; but their di&s;coveries con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of many hundreds of <HI>Roman</HI> copper-coins, and &s;ome medallions, all of the lower empire. There was not much <HI>virt&ugrave;</HI> &s;tirring at that time in this neighbourhood; however, &s;ome of the gentry and clergy around bought what plea&s;ed them be&s;t; and &s;ome dozens fell to the &s;hare of the author.</P>
<P>The owners at fir&s;t held their commodity at an high price; but, finding that they were not likely to meet with dealers at &s;uch a rate, they &s;oon lowered their terms, and &s;old the faire&s;t as they could. The coins that were rejected became current, and pa&s;&s;ed for farthings at the petty &s;hops. Of tho&s;e that we &s;aw, the greater part were of <HI>Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and the Empre&s;s <HI>Fau&s;tina,</HI> his wife, the father and mother of <HI>Commodus.</HI> Some of <HI>Fau&s;tina</HI> were in high relief, and exhibited a very agreeable &s;et of features, which pro|bably re&s;embled that lady, who was more celebrated for her beauty than for her virtues. The medallions in general were of a paler colour than the coins. To pretend to account for the means of their coming to this place would be &s;pending time in conjecture. The &s;pot, I think, could not be a <HI>Roman</HI> camp, becau&s;e it is commanded by hills on two &s;ides; nor does it &s;hew the lea&s;t traces
<PB N="311" REF="327">
of entrenchments; nor can I &s;uppo&s;e that it was a <HI>Roman</HI> town, becau&s;e I have too good an opinion of the ta&s;te and judgment of tho&s;e poli&s;hed conquerors to imagine that they would &s;ettle on &s;o barren and dreary a wa&s;te.</P>

<P>FROM the &s;ilence of <HI>Dome&s;day</HI> re&s;pecting churches, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that few villages had any at the time when that record was taken; but <HI>Selborne,</HI> we &s;ee, enjoyed the benefit of one: hence we may conclude, that this place was in no abject &s;tate even at that very di&s;tant period.

It is perfectly plain and unadorned, without painted gla&s;s, carved work, &s;culpture, or tracery. But when I &s;ay it has no claim to antiquity, I would mean to be under&s;tood of the fabric in general; for the pillars which &s;upport the roof are undoubtedly old, being of that low, &s;quat, thick order, u&s;ually called <HI>Saxon.</HI> The&s;e, I &s;hould imagine, upheld the roof of a former church, which, falling into decay, was rebuilt on tho&s;e ma&s;&s;y props, becau&s;e their &s;trength had pre&s;erved them from the injuries of time<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">In the &s;ame manner, to compare great things with &s;mall, did <HI>Wykeham,</HI> when he new-built the cathedral at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> from the tower we&s;tward, apply to his purpo&s;e the old piers or pillars of Bi&s;hop <HI>Walkelin</HI>'s church, by blending <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Gothic</HI> architecture together. See <HI>Lowth</HI>'s Life of Wykeham.</NOTE>. Upon the&s;e re&s;t blunt <HI>gothic</HI> arches, &s;uch as prevailed in the reign above|mentioned, and by which, as a criterion, we would prove the date of the building.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the &s;outh aile, between the we&s;t and &s;outh doors, &s;tands the font, which is deep and capacious, and con&s;i&s;ts of three ma&s;&s;y round &s;tones, piled one on another, without the lea&s;t ornament or &s;culpture: the cavity at the top is lined with lead, and has a pipe at bottom to convey off the water after the &s;acred ceremony is performed.</P>
<P>The ea&s;t end of the &s;outh aile is called the <HI>South Chancel,</HI> and, till within the&s;e thirty years, was divided off by old carved <HI>gothic</HI> frame|work of timber, having been a private chantry. In this opinion we are more confirmed by ob&s;erving two <HI>gothic</HI> niches within the &s;pace, the one in the ea&s;t wall and the other in the &s;outh, near which there probably &s;tood images and altars.</P>
<P>In the middle aile there is nothing remarkable; but I re|member when it's beams were hung with garlands in honour of
<PB N="316" REF="333">
young women of the pari&s;h, reputed to have died virgins; and recollect to have &s;een the clerk's wife cutting, in white paper, the re&s;emblances of gloves, and ribbons to be twi&s;ted into knots and ro&s;es, to decorate the&s;e memorials of cha&s;tity. In the church of <HI>Faringdon,</HI> which is the next pari&s;h, many garlands of this &s;ort &s;till remain.</P>
<P>The north aile is narrow and low, with a &s;loping ceiling, reach|ing within eight or nine feet of the floor. It had originally a flat roof covered with lead, till, within a century pa&s;t, a churchwarden &s;tripping off the lead, in order, as he &s;aid, to have it mended, &s;old it to a plumber, and ran away with the money. This aile has no door, for an obvious rea&s;on; becau&s;e the north-&s;ide of the church-yard, being &s;urrounded by the vicarage-garden, affords no path to that &s;ide of the church. Nothing can be more irregular than the pews of this church, which are of all dimen&s;ions and heights, being patched up according to the fancy of the owners: but whoever nicely examines them will find that the middle aile had, on each &s;ide, a regular row of benches of &s;olid oak, all alike, with a low back-board to each. The&s;e we &s;hould not he&s;itate to &s;ay are coeval with the pre&s;ent church: and e&s;pecially as it is to be ob&s;erved that, at their ends, they are ornamented with carved blunt <HI>gothic</HI> niches, exactly corre&s;pondent to the arches of the church, and to a niche in the &s;outh wall. The &s;outh aile al&s;o has a row of the&s;e benches; but &s;ome are decayed through age, and the re&s;t much di&s;gui&s;ed by modern alterations.</P>
<P>At the upper end of this aile, and running out to the north, &s;tands a tran&s;ept, known by the name of the <HI>North Chancel,</HI> mea|&s;uring twenty-one feet from &s;outh to north, and nineteen feet from ea&s;t to we&s;t: this was intended, no doubt, as a private chantry; and was al&s;o, till of late, divided off by a <HI>gothic</HI> frame|work
<PB N="317" REF="334">
of timber. In its north wall, under a very blunt <HI>gothic</HI> arch, lies perhaps the founder of this edifice, which, from the &s;hape of its arch, may be deemed no older than the latter end of the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. The tomb was examined &s;ome years ago, but contained nothing except the &s;cull and thigh-bones of a large tall man, and the bones of a youth or woman, lying in a very irregular manner, without any e&s;cutcheon or other token to a&s;cer|tain the names or rank of the decea&s;ed. The grave was very &s;hallow, and lined with &s;tone at the bottom and on the &s;ides.</P>
<P>From the ea&s;t wall project four &s;tone brackets, which I con|clude &s;upported images and crucifixes. In the great thick pila&s;ter, jutting out between this tran&s;ept and the chancel, there is a very &s;harp <HI>gothic</HI> niche, of older date than the pre&s;ent chantry or church. But the chief pieces of antiquity are two narrow &s;tone coffin-lids, which compo&s;e part of the floor, and lie from we&s;t to ea&s;t, with the very narrow ends ea&s;tward: the&s;e belong to remote times; and, if originally placed here, which I doubt, mu&s;t have been part of the pavement of an older tran&s;ept. At pre&s;ent there are no coffins under them, whence I conclude they have been removed to this place from &s;ome part of a &s;ormer church. One of the&s;e lids is &s;o eaten by time, that no &s;culpture can be di&s;|covered upon it; or, perhaps, it may be the wrong &s;ide upper|mo&s;t; but on the other, which &s;eems to be of &s;tone of a clo&s;er and harder texture, is to be di&s;cerned a <HI>di&s;cus,</HI> with a cro&s;s on it, at the end of a &s;taff or rod, the well-known &s;ymbol of a <HI>Knight-Templar</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Dugdale, Mona&s;ticon Anglicanum,</HI> Vol. II. where there is a fine engraving of a <HI>Knight-Templar,</HI> by <HI>Hollar.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>This order was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a red cro&s;s on the left &s;houlder of their cloak, and by this attribute in their hand. Now, if the&s;e
<PB N="318" REF="335">
&s;tones belonged to <HI>Knights Templars,</HI> they mu&s;t have lain here many centuries; for this order came into England early in the reign of king <HI>Stephen</HI> in 1113; and was di&s;&s;olved in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> II. in 1312, having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted only one hundred and ninety|nine years. Why I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Knights Templars</HI> were occa&s;ionally buried at this church, will appear in &s;ome future letter, when we come to treat more particularly concerning the property they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed here, and the intercour&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween them and the <HI>priors</HI> of <HI>Selborne.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t now proceed to the chancel, properly &s;o called, which &s;eems to be coeval with the church, and is in the &s;ame plain un|adorned &s;tyle, though neatly kept. This room mea&s;ures thirty|one feet in length, and &s;ixteen feet and an half in breadth, and is wain&s;coted all round, as high as to the bottom of the windows. The &s;pace for the communion table is rai&s;ed two &s;teps above the re&s;t of the floor, and railed in with oaken balu&s;ters. Here I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omewhat of the windows of the chancel in particular, and of the whole fabric in general. They are mo&s;tly of that &s;imple and unadorned &s;ort called <HI>Lancet,</HI> &s;ome &s;ingle, &s;ome double, and &s;ome in triplets. At the ea&s;t end of the chancel are two of a moderate &s;ize, near each other; and in the north wall two very di&s;tant &s;mall ones, unequal in length and height: and in the &s;outh wall are two, one on each &s;ide of the chancel door, that are broad and &s;quat, and of a different order. At the ea&s;t end of the &s;outh aile of the church there is a large lancet-window in a triplet; and two very &s;mall, narrow, &s;ingle ones in the &s;outh wall, and a broad &s;quat window be&s;ide, and a double lancet one in the we&s;t end; &s;o that the appearance is very irregular. In the north aile are two windows, made &s;horter when the roof was &s;loped; and in the north tran&s;ept a large triple window, &s;hortened

<P>WE have now taken leave of the in&s;ide of the church, and &s;hall pa&s;s by a door at the we&s;t end of the middle aile into the belfry. This room is part of a hand&s;ome &s;quare embattled tower of forty|five feet in height, and of much more modern date than the church; but old enough to have needed a thorough repair in 1781, when it was neatly &s;tuccoed at a con&s;iderable expen&s;e, by a &s;et of workmen who were employed on it for the greate&s;t part of the &s;ummer. The old bells, three in number, loud and out of tune, were taken down in 1735, and ca&s;t into four; to which <HI>Sir Simeon Stuart,</HI> the grandfather of the pre&s;ent baronet, added a fifth at his own expen&s;e: and, be&s;towing it in the name of his favourite daughter Mrs. <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> cau&s;ed it to be ca&s;t with the following motto round it:
<Q><L>"Clara puella dedit, dixitque mihi e&s;to Maria:</L>
<L>"Illius et laudes nomen ad a&s;tra &s;ono."</L></Q></P>
<P>The day of the arrival of this tuneable peal was ob&s;erved as an high fe&s;tival by the village, and rendered more joyous, by an order from the donor, that the treble-bell &s;hould be fixed bottom upward in the ground, and filled with punch, of which all pre&s;ent were permitted to partake.</P>
<P>The porch of the church, to the &s;outh, is modern, and would not be worthy attention did it not &s;helter a fine &s;harp <HI>gothic</HI> door-way. This is undoubtedly much older than the pre&s;ent fabric; and,
<PB N="322" REF="339">
being found in good pre&s;ervation, was worked into the wall, and is the grand entrance into the church: nor are the folding-doors to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; &s;ince, from their thick and clum&s;y &s;tructure, and the rude flouri&s;hed-work of their hinges, they may po&s;&s;ibly be as ancient as the door-way it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The whole roof of the &s;outh aile, and the &s;outh-&s;ide of the roof of the middle aile, is covered with oaken &s;hingles in&s;tead of tiles, on account of their lightne&s;s, which favours the ancient and crazy timber-frame. And, indeed, the con&s;ideration of accidents by fire excepted, this &s;ort of roofing is much more eligible than tiles. For &s;hingles well &s;ea&s;oned, and cleft from quartered timber, never warp, nor let in drifting &s;now; nor do they &s;hiver with fro&s;t; nor are they liable to be blown off, like tiles; but, when well nailed down, la&s;t for a long period, as experience has &s;hown us in this place, where tho&s;e that face to the north are known to have endured, untouched, by undoubted tradition for more than a century.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the &s;ize of the church, and the extent of the pari&s;h, the church-yard is very &s;canty; and e&s;pecially as all wi&s;h to be buried on the &s;outh-&s;ide, which is become &s;uch a ma&s;s of mortality that no per&s;on can be there interred without di&s;turbing or di&s;placing the bones of his ance&s;tors. There is rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it once was larger, and extended to what is now the vicarage court and garden; becau&s;e many human bones have been dug up in tho&s;e parts &s;everal yards without the pre&s;ent limits. At the ea&s;t end are a few graves; yet none till very lately on the north-&s;ide but, as two or three families of be&s;t repute have begun to bury in that quarter, prejudice may wear out by degrees, and their example be followed by the re&s;t of the neighbourhood.</P>

In &s;peaking of the church, I have all along talked of the ea&s;t and we&s;t-end, as if the chancel &s;tood exactly true to tho&s;e points of the compa&s;s; but this is by no means the ca&s;e, for the fabric bears &s;o much to the north of the ea&s;t that the four corners of the tower, and not the four &s;ides, &s;tand to the four cardinal points. The be&s;t method of accounting for this deviation &s;eems to be, that the workmen, who probably were employed in the longe&s;t days, endeavoured to &s;et the chancels to the ri&s;ing of the &s;un.</P>
<P>Clo&s;e by the church, at the we&s;t end, &s;tands the vicarage-hou&s;e; an old, but roomy and convenient edifice. It faces very agreeably to the morning &s;un, and is divided from the village by a neat and cheerful court. According to the manner of old times, the hall was open to the roof; and &s;o continued, probably, till the vicars became family-men, and began to want more conveniencies; when they flung a floor acro&s;s, and, by partitions, divided the &s;pace into chambers. In this hall we remember a date, &s;ome time in the reign of <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> it was over the door that leads to the &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Behind the hou&s;e is a garden of an irregular &s;hape, but well laid out; who&s;e terrace commands &s;o romantic and picture&s;que a pro|&s;pect, that the fir&s;t ma&s;ter in land&s;cape might contemplate it with plea&s;ure, and deem it an object well worthy of his pencil.</P>

<P>IN the church-yard of this village is a <HI>yew-tree,</HI> who&s;e a&s;pect be|&s;peaks it to be of a great age: it &s;eems to have &s;een &s;everal centuries, and is probably coeval with the church, and therefore may be deemed an antiquity: the body is &s;quat, &s;hort, and thick, and mea&s;ures twenty-three feet in the girth, &s;upporting an head of &s;uitable extent to it's bulk. This is a male tree, which in the &s;pring &s;heds clouds of du&s;t, and fills the atmo&s;phere around with it's farina.</P>
<P>As far as we have been able to ob&s;erve, the males of this &s;pecies become much larger than the females; and it has &s;o fallen out that mo&s;t of the yew-trees in the church-yards of this neighbour|hood are males: but this mu&s;t have been matter of mere accident, &s;ince men, when they fir&s;t planted yews, little dreamed that there were &s;exes in trees.</P>
<P>In a yard, in the mid&s;t of the &s;treet, till very lately grew a middle-&s;ized female tree of the &s;ame &s;pecies, which commonly bore great crops of berries. By the high winds u&s;ually prevailing about the autumnal equinox, the&s;e berries, then ripe, were blown down into the road, where the hogs ate them. And it was very remarkable, that, though barrow-hogs and young &s;ows found no inconvenience from this food, yet milch-&s;ows often died after &s;uch a repa&s;t: a circum&s;tance that can be accounted for only by &s;uppo&s;ing that the latter, being much exhau&s;ted and hungry, devoured a larger quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="343">
While mention is making of the bad effects of yew-berries, it may be proper to remind the unwary that the twigs and leaves of yew, though eaten in a very &s;mall quantity, are certain death to hor&s;es and cows, and that in a few minutes. An hor&s;e tied to a yew-hedge, or to a faggot-&s;tack of dead yew, &s;hall be found dead before the owner can be aware that any danger is at hand: and the writer has been &s;everal times a &s;orrowful witne&s;s to lo&s;&s;es of this kind among his friends; and in the i&s;land of <HI>Ely</HI> had once the mortification to &s;ee nine young &s;teers or bullocks of his own all lying dead in an heap from browzing a little on an hedge of yew in an old garden, into which they had broken in &s;nowy weather. Even the clippings of a yew-hedge have de&s;troyed a whole dairy of cows when thrown inadvertently into a yard. And yet &s;heep and turkies, and, as park-keepers &s;ay, deer, will crop the&s;e trees with impunity.</P>
<P>Some intelligent per&s;ons a&s;&s;ert that the branches of yew, while <HI>green,</HI> are not noxious; and that they will kill only when <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>withered,</HI> by lacerating the &s;tomach: but to this a&s;&s;ertion we cannot by any means a&s;&s;ent, becau&s;e, among the number of cattle that we have known fall victims to this deadly food, not one has been found, when it was opened, but had a lump of <HI>green</HI> yew in it's paunch. True it is, that yew-trees &s;tand for twenty years or more in a field, and no bad con&s;equences en&s;ue: but at &s;ome time or other cattle, either from wantonne&s;s when full, or from hunger when empty, (from both which circum&s;tances we have &s;een them peri&s;h) will be meddling, to their certain de&s;truction; the yew &s;eems to be a very improper tree for a pa&s;ture-field.</P>
<P>Antiquaries &s;eem much at a lo&s;s to determine at what period this tree fir&s;t obtained a place in church-yards. A &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed A.D. 1307 and 35 <HI>Edward</HI> I. the title of which is <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ne rector
<PB N="326" REF="344">
arbores in cemeterio pro&s;ternat."</Q> Now if it is recollected that we &s;eldom &s;ee any other very large or ancient tree in a church-yard but yews, this &s;tatute mu&s;t have principally related to this &s;pecies of tree; and con&s;equently their being planted in church-yards is of much more ancient date than the year 1307.</P>
<P>As to the u&s;e of the&s;e trees, po&s;&s;ibly the more re&s;pectable pari&s;hioners were buried under their &s;hade before the improper cu&s;tom was introduced of burying within the body of the church, where the living are to a&s;&s;emble. <HI>Deborah, Rebekah</HI>'s nur&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxv, 8.</NOTE>, was buried under an oak; the mo&s;t honourable place of interment probably next to the cave of <HI>Machpelah</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxiii, 9.</NOTE>, which &s;eems to have been appropriated to the remains of the patriarchal family alone.</P>
<P>The farther u&s;e of yew-trees might be as a &s;creen to churches, by their thick foliage, from the violence of winds; perhaps al&s;o for the purpo&s;e of archery, the be&s;t long bows being made of that material: and we do not hear that they are planted in the church-yards of other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where long bows were not &s;o much in u&s;e. They might al&s;o be placed as a &s;helter to the congregation a&s;&s;embling before the church-doors were opened, and as an emblem of mortality by their funereal appearance. In the &s;outh of <HI>England</HI> every church-yard almo&s;t has it's tree, and &s;ome two; but in the north, we under&s;tand, few are to be found.</P>
<P>The idea of R. C. that the <HI>yew-tree</HI> afforded it's branches in&s;tead of palms for the proce&s;&s;ions on <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> is a good one, and de&s;erves attention. <BIBL>See Gent. Mag. Vol. L. p. 128.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to the <HI>Priory,</HI> which is undoubtedly the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Priory</HI> of <HI>Selborne</HI> was founded by <HI>Peter de la Roche,</HI> or <HI>de Rupibus</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Godwin</HI> de Prae&s;ulibus Anglia. Folio. London. 1743. p. 217.</NOTE>, one of tho&s;e accompli&s;hed foreigners that re&s;orted to the court of king <HI>John,</HI> where they were u&s;ually care&s;&s;ed, and met with a more favourable reception than ought, in prudence, to have been &s;hown by any monarch to &s;trangers. This adventurer was a <HI>Poictevin</HI> by birth, had been bred to arms in his youth, and di&s;|tingui&s;hed by knighthood. Hi&s;torians all agree not to &s;peak very favourably of this remarkable man; they allow that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of courage and fine abilities, but then they charge him with arbitrary principles, and violent conduct. By his in&s;inuating manners he &s;oon ro&s;e high in the favour of <HI>John;</HI> and in 1205, early in the reign of that prince, was appointed bi&s;hop of <HI>Win|che&s;ter.</HI> In 1214 he became lord chief ju&s;ticiary of <HI>England,</HI> the fir&s;t magi&s;trate in the &s;tate, and a kind of viceroy, on whom de|pended all the civil affairs in the kingdom. After the death of <HI>John,</HI> and during the minority of his &s;on <HI>Henry,</HI> this prelate took upon him the entire management of the realm, and was &s;oon appointed protector of the king and kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="352">
The barons &s;aw with indignation a &s;tranger po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the power and influence, to part of which they thought they had a claim; they therefore entered into an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t him, and determined to wre&s;t &s;ome of that authority from him which he had &s;o unrea&s;onably u&s;urped. The bi&s;hop di&s;cerned the &s;torm at a di&s;tance; and, prudently re&s;olving to give way to that torrent of envy which he knew not how to with&s;tand, withdrew quietly to the Holy Land, where he re&s;ided &s;ome time.</P>
<P>At this juncture a very &s;mall part of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> remained in the hands of the Chri&s;tians: they had been by <HI>Saladine</HI> di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and all the internal parts, near forty years before; and with difficulty maintained &s;ome maritime towns and garri&s;ons: yet the bu&s;y and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of <HI>de Rupibus</HI> could not be at re&s;t; he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the &s;plendour and magnificence of his expen&s;es, and amu&s;ed his mind by &s;trengthening fortre&s;&s;es and ca&s;tles, and by removing and endowing of churches. Before his expedition to the ea&s;t he had &s;ignalized him&s;elf as a founder of convents, and as a benefactor to ho&s;pitals and mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>In the year 1231 he returned again to <HI>England;</HI> and the very next year, in 1232, began to build and endow the PRIORY of SELBORNE. As this great work followed &s;o clo&s;e upon his return, it is not improbable that it was the re&s;ult of a vow made during his voyage; and e&s;pecially as it was dedicated to the <HI>Virgin Mary.</HI> Why the bi&s;hop made choice of <HI>Selborne</HI> for the &s;cene of his munificence can never be determined now: it can only be &s;aid that the pari&s;h was in his dioce&s;e, and lay almo&s;t midway between <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Farnham,</HI> or <HI>South Waltham</HI> and <HI>Farnham;</HI> from either of which places he could without much trouble overlook his workmen, and ob&s;erve what progre&s;s they made; and that the &s;ituation was retired, with a &s;tream running by it, and

Regular-Canons</HI> were &s;uch as lived in a conventual manner, under one roof, had a common refectory and dormitary, and were bound by vows to ob&s;erve the rules and &s;tatutes of their order: in fine, they were a kind of religious, who&s;e di&s;cipline was le&s;s rigid than the <HI>monks.</HI> The chief rule of the&s;e <HI>canons</HI> was that of <HI>St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> who was con&s;tituted bi&s;hop of <HI>Hippo,</HI> A.D. 395: but they were not brought into <HI>England</HI> till after the conque&s;t; and &s;eem not to have obtained the appellation of <HI>Augu&s;tine canons</HI> till &s;ome years after.

<P><HI>De Achangre</HI> al&s;o accommodated the bi&s;hop at the &s;ame in&s;tant with three more adjoining crofts, which for a time was all the footing that this in&s;titution obtained in the pari&s;h.

<P>Finding him&s;elf &s;till &s;treightened for room, the founder applied to his royal ma&s;ter, <HI>Henry,</HI> who was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be&s;tow certain lands in the manor at <HI>Selborne</HI> on the new priory of his favourite mini&s;ter.

<P>This appeared to me from the fir&s;t to have been an over&s;ight, before I had &s;een my authentic evidences. For <HI>priories alien,</HI> a few <HI>conventual</HI> ones excepted, were little better than <HI>granges</HI> to foreign abbies; and their priors little more than bailiffs, removeable at will: whereas the <HI>priory</HI> of <HI>Selborne</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the valuable e&s;tates and manors of <HI>Selborne, Achangre, Norton, Brompden, Ba&s;&s;inges, Ba&s;ing&s;toke,</HI> and <HI>Natele;</HI> and the prior challenged the right of <HI>Pillory, Thurcet,</HI> and <HI>Fureas,</HI> and every manerial privilege.</P>

<P>It would be tedious to enumerate every little grant for lands or tenements that might be produced from my vouchers.

Every per&s;on round was de&s;irous to promote &s;o good a work; and either by &s;ale, by grant, or by gift in rever&s;ion, was ambitious of appearing a benefactor. They who had not lands to &s;pare gave roads to accommodate the in|fant foundation. The religious were not backward in keeping up this pious propen&s;ity, which they ob&s;erved &s;o readily in|fluenced the brea&s;ts of men. Thus did the more opulent mona&s;|teries add hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and field to field; and by degrees manor to manor: till at la&s;t <Q REND="inline">"there was no place left;"</Q> but every di&s;trict around became appropriated to the purpo&s;es of their founders, and every precinct was drawn into the vortex.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>OUR forefathers in this village were no doubt as bu&s;y and bu&s;tling, and as important, as our&s;elves: yet have their names and tran&s;actions been forgotten from century to century, and have &s;unk into oblivion; nor has this happened only to the vulgar, but even to men remarkable and famous in their generation. I was led into this train of thinking by finding in my vouchers that Sir <HI>Adam Gurdon</HI> was an inhabitant of <HI>Selborne,</HI> and a man of the fir&s;t rank and property in the pari&s;h. By Sir <HI>Adam Gurdon</HI> I would be under&s;tood to mean that leading and accompli&s;hed malecontent in the <HI>Mountfort</HI> faction, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his daring conduct in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. The fir&s;t that we hear of this per&s;on in my papers is, that with two others he was bailiff of <HI>Alton</HI> before the &s;ixteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> III. <HI>viz.</HI> about 1231, and then not knighted. Who <HI>Gurdon</HI> was, and whence he came, does not appear: yet there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he was ori|ginally a mere &s;oldier of fortune, who had rai&s;ed him&s;elf by mar|rying women of property. The name of <HI>Gurdon</HI> does not &s;eem to be known in the &s;outh; but there is a name &s;o like it in an adjoining kingdom, and which belongs to two or three noble families, that it is probable this remarkable per&s;on was a <HI>North Briton;</HI> and the more &s;o, &s;ince the Chri&s;tian name of <HI>Adam</HI> is a di&s;tingui&s;hed one to this day among the family of the <HI>Gordons.</HI>&mdash;But, be this as it may, Sir <HI>Adam Gurdon</HI> has been noticed by all the writers of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory for his bold di&s;po&s;ition and di&s;affected
<PB N="341" REF="359">
&s;pirit, in that he not only figured during the &s;ucce&s;sful rebellion of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> but kept up the war after the defeat and death of that baron's entrenching him&s;elf in the woods of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> to|wards the town of <HI>Farnham.</HI> After the battle of <HI>Eve&s;ham,</HI> in which <HI>Mountfort</HI> fell, in the year 1265, <HI>Gurdon</HI> might not think it &s;afe to return to his hou&s;e for fear of a &s;urpri&s;e; but cautiou&s;ly fortified him&s;elf amid&s;t the fore&s;ts and woodlands with which he was &s;o well acquainted. Prince <HI>Edward,</HI> de&s;irous of putting an end to the troubles which had &s;o long hara&s;&s;ed the kingdom, pur&s;ued the arch-rebel into his fa&s;tne&s;&s;es; attacked his camp; leaped over the entrenchments; and, &s;ingling out <HI>Gurdon,</HI> ran him down, wounded him, and took him pri&s;oner<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 675. &amp; Triveti Annale.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is not perhaps in all hi&s;tory a more remarkable in&s;tance of command of temper, and magnanimity, than this before us: that a young prince, in the moment of victory, when he had the fell adver&s;ary of the crown and royal family at his mercy, &s;hould be able to withhold his hand from that vengeance which the van|qui&s;hed &s;o well de&s;erved. A cowardly di&s;po&s;ition would have been blinded by re&s;entment: but this gallant heir-apparent &s;aw at once a method of converting a mo&s;t de&s;perate foe into a la&s;ting friend. He rai&s;ed the fallen veteran from the ground, he par|doned him, he admitted him into his confidence, and introduced him to the queen, then lying at <HI>Guildford,</HI> that very evening<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">M. Paris, p. 675. &amp; Triveti Annale.</NOTE>. This unmerited and unexpected lenity melted the heart of the rugged <HI>Gurdon</HI> at once; he became in an in&s;tant a loyal and u&s;eful &s;ub|ject, tru&s;ted and employed in matters of moment by <HI>Edward</HI> when king, and confided in till the day of his death.</P>

<P>IT has been hinted in a former letter that Sir <HI>Adam Gurdon</HI> had availed him&s;elf by marrying women of property.

<P>The manor-hou&s;e called <HI>Temple</HI> is at pre&s;ent a &s;ingle building, running in length from &s;outh to north, and has been occupied as a common farm hou&s;e from time immemorial. The &s;outh end is modern, and con&s;i&s;ts of a brew-hou&s;e, and then a kitchen. The middle part is an hall twenty-&s;even feet in length, and nineteen feet in breadth; and has been formerly open to the top; but there is now a floor above it, and al&s;o a chimney in the we&s;tern wall. The roofing con&s;i&s;ts of &s;trong ma&s;&s;ive rafter-work ornamented with carved ro&s;es. I have often looked for the <HI>lamb</HI> and <HI>flag,</HI> the arms of the <HI>knights templars,</HI> without &s;ucce&s;s; but in one corner found a fox with a goo&s;e on his back, &s;o coar&s;ely executed, that it re|quired &s;ome attention to make out the device.</P>
<P>Beyond the hall to the north is a &s;mall parlour with a va&s;t heavy &s;tone chimney-piece; and, at the end of all, the <HI>chapel</HI> or <HI>oratory,</HI> who&s;e ma&s;&s;ive thick walls and narrow windows at once be&s;peak

great antiquity. This room is only &s;ixteen feet by &s;ixteen feet eight inches; and full &s;eventeen feet nine inches in height. The ceiling is formed of va&s;t joi&s;ts, placed only five or &s;ix inches apart. Modern delicacy would not much approve of &s;uch a place of wor|&s;hip: for it has at pre&s;ent much more the appearance of a dungeon than of a room fit for the reception of people of condition. For the out&s;ide I refer the reader to the plate, in which Mr. <HI>Grimm</HI> has repre&s;ented it with his u&s;ual accuracy. The field on which this oratory abuts is &s;till called Chapel-field. The &s;ituation of this hou&s;e is very particular, for it &s;tands upon the immediate verge of a &s;teep abrupt hill.</P>
<P>Not many years &s;ince this place was u&s;ed for an hop-kiln, and was divided into two &s;tories by a loft, part of which remains at pre&s;ent, and makes it convenient for peat and turf, with which it is &s;towed.</P>

<P>THE Priory at times was much obliged to <HI>Gurdon</HI> and his family. As <HI>Sir Adam</HI> began to advance in years he found his mind influ|enced by the prevailing opinion of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and efficacy of prayers for the dead; and, therefore, in conjunction with his wife <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> in the year 1271, granted to the prior and convent of <HI>Selborne</HI> all his right and claim to a certain place, <HI>placea,</HI> called <HI>La Pley&s;tow,</HI> in the village afore&s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in <HI>liberam, puram,</HI> et <HI>per|petuam elemo&s;inam.</HI>"</Q> This <HI>Pley&s;tow</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Saxon</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, or <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">; viz. <HI>Plege&s;tow,</HI> or <HI>Plegstow.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>locus ludorum,</HI> or play-place, is a level area near the church of about forty-four yards by thirty-&s;ix, and is known now by the name of the <HI>Ple&s;tor</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">At this juncture probably the va&s;t oak, mentioned p. 5, was planted by the prior, as an ornament to his new acquired market place.

From this period <HI>Selborne</HI> became a market town: but how long it enjoyed that pri|vilege does not appear. At the &s;ame time <HI>Gurdon</HI> re&s;erved to him&s;elf, and his heirs, a way through the &s;aid <HI>Ple&s;tor</HI> to a tenement and &s;ome crofts at the upper end, abutting on the &s;outh corner of the church-yard. This was, in old days, the manerial hou&s;e of the &s;treet manor, though now a poor cottage; and is known at pre&s;ent by the modern name of <HI>Elliot's.

<P>From circum&s;tances put together it appears that the above were the fir&s;t grants obtained by the Priory in the village of <HI>Selborne,</HI> after it had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted about thirty-nine years: moreover they explain the nature of the mixed manor &s;till remaining in and about the village, where one field or tenement &s;hall belong to <HI>Magdalen|college</HI>

This writ is dated in the tenth year of the reign of <HI>Edward,</HI> viz. 1282.</P>
<P>All the king's writs directed to <HI>Gurdon</HI> are addre&s;&s;ed in the following manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Edwardus,</HI> Dei gratia, &amp;c. dilecto et fideli &s;uo <HI>Ade Gurdon</HI> &s;alutem;"</Q> and again, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cu&s;todi fore&s;te &s;ue de <HI>Wolvemere.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>In the year 1293 a quarrel between the crews of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and a <HI>Norman</HI> &s;hip, about &s;ome trifle, brought on by degrees &s;uch &s;erious con&s;equences, that in 1295 a war broke out between the
<PB N="350" REF="372">
two nations. The <HI>French</HI> king, <HI>Philip the Hardy,</HI> gained &s;ome advantages in <HI>Ga&s;cony;</HI> and, not content with tho&s;e, threatened <HI>England</HI> with an inva&s;ion, and, by a &s;udden attempt, took and burnt <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this emergency <HI>Edward</HI> &s;ent a writ to <HI>Gurdon,</HI> ordering him and four others to enli&s;t three thou&s;and &s;oldiers in the counties of <HI>Surrey, Dor&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> able-bodied men, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tam &s;agittare quam bali&s;tare potentes;"</Q> and to &s;ee that they were marched, by the fea&s;t of <HI>All Saints,</HI> to <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> there to be embarked aboard the king's tran&s;ports.</P>

<P>The above are the la&s;t traces that I can di&s;cover of <HI>Gurdon</HI>'s appearing and acting in public. The fir&s;t notice that my evidences give of him is, that, in 1232, being the 16th of <HI>Henry</HI> III. he was the king's bailiff, with others, for the town of <HI>Alton.</HI> Now,
<PB N="351" REF="373">
from 1232 to 1295 is a &s;pace of &s;ixty-three years; a long period for one man to be employed in active life! Should any one doubt whether all the&s;e particulars can relate to one and the &s;ame per&s;on, I &s;hould wi&s;h him to attend to the following rea&s;ons why they might. In the fir&s;t place, the documents from the priory mention but one Sir <HI>Adam Gurdon,</HI> who had no &s;on lawfully begotten: and in the next, we are to recollect that he mu&s;t have probably been a man of uncommon vigour both of mind and body; &s;ince no one, un&s;upported by &s;uch accompli&s;hments, could have engaged in &s;uch adventures, or could have borne up again&s;t the difficulties which he &s;ometimes mu&s;t have encountered: and, moreover, we have modern in&s;tances of per&s;ons that have maintained their abilities for near that period.</P>
<P>Were we to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Gurdon</HI> to be only twenty years of age in 1232, in 1295 he would be eighty-three; after which ad|vanced period it could not be expected that he &s;hould live long. From the &s;ilence, therefore, of my evidences it &s;eems probable that this extraordinary per&s;on fini&s;hed his life in peace, not long after, at his man&s;ion of <HI>Temple. Gurdon</HI>'s &s;eal had for its device&mdash;a man, with an helmet on his head, drawing a cro&s;s-bow; the legend, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Sigillum Ade de Gurdon;</HI>"</Q> his arms were, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Goulis, iii floures argent i&s;&s;ant de te&s;tes de leopards<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">From the collection of <HI>Thomas Martin,</HI> E&s;q. in the Antiquarian Repertory, p. 109, N^o. XXXI.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>If the &s;tout and un&s;ubmitting &s;pirit of <HI>Gurdon</HI> could be &s;o much influenced by the belief and &s;uper&s;tition of the times, much more might the hearts of his ladies and daughter.

<P>The third tran&s;action (though for want of dates we cannot &s;ay which happened fir&s;t and which la&s;t) was a grant from <HI>Robert Samford</HI> to the priory of a tenement and its appurtenances in the village of <HI>Selborne,</HI> given to the <HI>Templars</HI> by <HI>Americus de Va&s;ci</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Americus Va&s;ci,</HI> by his name, mu&s;t have been an <HI>Italian,</HI> and had been probably a &s;oldier of fortune, and one of <HI>Gordon</HI>'s captains. <HI>Americus Ve&s;pucio,</HI> the per&s;on who gave name to the new world, was a <HI>florentine.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>I find not the lea&s;t traces of any concerns between <HI>Gurdon</HI> and the <HI>Knights Templars;</HI> but probably after his death his daughter <HI>Johanna</HI> might have, and might be&s;tow, <HI>Temple</HI> on that order in &s;upport of the holy land: and, moreover, &s;he &s;eems to have been moving from <HI>Selborne</HI> when &s;he &s;old her goods and chattels to the priory, as mentioned above.</P>
<P><HI>Temple</HI> no doubt did belong to the knights, as may be a&s;&s;erted, not only from it's name, but al&s;o from another corroborating circum&s;tance of it's being &s;till a manor <HI>tithe-free;</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for, by virtue of their order,"</Q> &s;ays Dr. <HI>Black&s;tone,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the lands of the <HI>Knights Templars</HI> were privileged by the pope with a di&s;charge from tithes."</Q></P>
<P>Antiquaries have been much puzzled about the terms <HI>preceptores</HI> and <HI>preceptorium,</HI> not being able to determine what officer or edi|&s;ice was meant.

For if it be allowed here that <HI>preceptor</HI> and <HI>ballivus</HI> are &s;ynonymous words, then the brother who took on him that office re&s;ided in the hou&s;e of the <HI>Templars</HI> at <HI>Sudington,</HI> a <HI>preceptory;</HI> where he was their <HI>preceptor,</HI> &s;uperintended their affairs, received their money; and, as in the in&s;tance there mentioned, paid from their chamber, "<HI>camera,</HI>" as directed: &s;o that, according to this
<PB N="358" REF="380">
explanation, a <HI>preceptor</HI> was no other than a &s;teward, and a <HI>precep|torium</HI> was his re&s;idence. I am well aware that, according to &s;trict Latin, the <HI>vel</HI> &s;hould have been <HI>&s;eu</HI> or <HI>five,</HI> and the order of the words <Q REND="inline">"<HI>preceptoris no&s;tri,</HI> vel ballivi, qui"</Q>&mdash;et <Q REND="inline">"<HI>ibidem</HI>"</Q> &s;hould have been <HI>ibi; ibidem</HI> nece&s;&s;arily having reference to <HI>two</HI> or more per&s;ons: but it will hardly be thought fair to apply the niceties of cla&s;&s;ic rules to the Latinity of the thirteenth century, the writers of which &s;eem to have aimed at nothing farther than to render them&s;elves intelligible.</P>
<P>There is another remark that we have made, which, I think, corroborates what has been advanced; and that is, that <HI>Richard Carpenter, preceptor</HI> of <HI>Sudington,</HI> at the time of the tran&s;actions between the <HI>Templars</HI> and <HI>Selborne</HI> Priory, did always &s;ign <HI>la&s;t</HI> as a witne&s;s in the three deeds: he calls him&s;elf <HI>frater,</HI> it is true, among many other brothers, but &s;ub&s;cribes with a kind of deference, as if, for the time being, his <HI>office</HI> rendered him an inferior in the community<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>In two or three ancient records relating to St. <HI>O&s;wald</HI>'s ho&s;pital in the city of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> printed by Dr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> p. 227 and 228, of his collections for the hi&s;tory of <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> the words <HI>preceptorium</HI> and <HI>preceptoria</HI> &s;ignify the <HI>ma&s;ter&s;hip</HI> of the &s;aid ho&s;pital: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ad <HI>preceptorium</HI> five <HI>magi&s;terium</HI> pre&s;entavit&mdash;<HI>preceptorii</HI> five <HI>magi&s;terii</HI> patro|nus.

<P>Some of the&s;e injunctions I &s;hall here produce; and they are &s;uch as will not fail, I think, to give &s;atisfaction to the antiquary, both as never having been publi&s;hed before, and as they are a curious picture of mona&s;tic irregularities at that time.</P>
<P>The documents that I allude to are contained in the <HI>Notabilis Vi&s;itatio de Seleburne,</HI> held at the Priory of that place, by <HI>Wykeham</HI> in per&s;on, in the year 1387.</P>
<P>This evidence, in the original, is written on two &s;kins of parch|ment; the one large, and the other &s;maller, and con&s;i&s;ts of a <HI>pre|amble,</HI> 36 <HI>items,</HI> and a <HI>conclu&s;ion,</HI> which altogether evince the patient inve&s;tigation of the vi&s;itor, for which he had always been &s;o remarkable in all matters of moment, and how much he had at heart the regularity of tho&s;e in&s;titutions, of who&s;e efficacy in their prayers for the dead he was &s;o firmly per&s;uaded. As the bi&s;hop was &s;o much in earne&s;t, we may be a&s;&s;ured that he had nothing in view but to correct and reform what he found ami&s;s; and was under no bias to blacken, or mi&s;repre&s;ent, as the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;eem in part to have done at the time of the reformation<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Letters of this &s;ort from Dr. <HI>Layton</HI> to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> are &s;till extant.</NOTE>. We may therefore with rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e that the bi&s;hop gives us an exact delineation of the morals and manners of the canons of <HI>Selborne</HI> at that juncture; and that what he found they had omitted he enjoins them; and for what they have done ami&s;s, and contrary to their rules and
<PB N="366" REF="388">
&s;tatutes, he reproves them; and threatens them with puni&s;hment &s;uitable to their irregularities.</P>
<P>This <HI>vi&s;itatio</HI> is of con&s;iderable length, and cannot be intro|duced into the body of this work; we &s;hall therefore refer the reader to the <HI>Appendix,</HI> where he will find every particular, while we &s;hall take &s;ome notice, and make &s;ome remarks, on the mo&s;t &s;ingular <HI>items</HI> as they occur.</P>
<P>In the preamble the vi&s;itor &s;ays&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Con&s;idering the charge lying upon us, that your blood may not be required at our hands, we came down to vi&s;it your Priory, as our office re|quired: and every time we repeated our vi&s;itation we found &s;omething &s;till not only contrary to regular rules but al&s;o re|pugnant to religion and good reputation."</Q></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t article after the preamble&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he commands them on their obedience, and on pain of the greater excommunication, to &s;ee that the canonical hours by night and by day be &s;ung in their choir, and the ma&s;&s;es of the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Mary,</HI> and other accu&s;tomed ma&s;&s;es, be celebrated at the proper hours with devo|tion, and at moderate pau&s;es; and that it be not allowed to any to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the hours and ma&s;&s;es, or to withdraw before they are fini&s;hed."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Item</HI> 2d. He enjoins them to ob&s;erve that &s;ilence to which they are &s;o &s;trictly bound by the rule of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> at &s;tated times, and wholly to ab&s;tain from frivolous conver&s;ation.</P>

<P><HI>Item</HI> 8th. The canons are here accu&s;ed of refu&s;ing to accept of their &s;tatutable clothing year by year, and of demanding a certain &s;pecified &s;um of money, as if it were their annual rent and due. This the bi&s;hop forbids, and orders that the canons &s;hall be clothed out of the revenue of the Priory, and the old garments be laid by in a chamber and given to the poor, according to the rule of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Item</HI> 9th is a complaint that &s;ome of the canons are given to wander out of the precincts of the convent without leave; and that others ride to their manors and farms, under pretence of in|&s;pecting the concerns of the &s;ociety, when they plea&s;e, and &s;tay as long as they plea&s;e. But they are enjoined never to &s;tir either about their own private concerns or the bu&s;ine&s;s of the convent without leave from the prior: and no canon is to go alone, but to have a grave brother to accompany him.</P>
<P>The injunction in <HI>Item</HI> 10th, at this di&s;tance of time, appears rather ludicrous; but the vi&s;itor &s;eems to be very &s;erious on the occa&s;ion, and &s;ays that it has been evidently proved to him that &s;ome of the canons, living di&s;&s;olutely after the fle&s;h, and not after the &s;pirit, &s;leep naked in their beds without their breeches

<P>At this di&s;tance of time it &s;eems matter of great wonder to us how the&s;e &s;ocieties, so nobly endowed, and who&s;e members were exempt by their very in&s;titution from every means of per&s;onal and

<P>Religious hou&s;es might &s;ometimes be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their revenues by fires among their buildings, or large dilapidations from &s;torms, &amp;c.; but no &s;uch accident appears to have befallen the Priory at <HI>Selborne.</HI> Tho&s;e &s;ituate on public roads, or in great towns where there were &s;hrines of &s;aints, were liable to be intruded on by travel|lers, devotees, and pilgrims; and were &s;ubject to the importunity of the poor, who &s;warmed at their gates to partake of doles and broken victuals.

<P>The conduct of the religious had now for &s;ome time been generally bad. Many of the mona&s;tic &s;ocieties, being very opu|lent, were become voluptuous and licentious, and had deviated entirely from their original in&s;titutions. The laity &s;aw with indig|nation the wealth and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their pious ance&s;tors perverted to the &s;ervice of &s;en&s;uality and indulgence; and &s;pent in gratifi|cations highly unbecoming the purpo&s;es for which they were
<PB N="381" REF="403">
given. A total di&s;regard to their re&s;pective rules and di&s;cipline drew on the monks and canons a heavy load of popular odium. Some good men there were who endeavoured to oppo&s;e the general delinquency; but their efforts were too feeble to &s;tem the torrent of mona&s;tic luxury. As far back as the year 1381 <HI>Wickliffe</HI>'s prin|ciples and doctrines had made &s;ome progre&s;s, were well received by men who wi&s;hed for a reformation, and were defended and maintained by them as long as they dared; till the bi&s;hops and clergy began to be &s;o greatly alarmed, that they procured an act to be pa&s;&s;ed by which the &s;ecular arm was empowered to &s;upport the corrupt doctrines of the church; but the fir&s;t lollard was not burnt until the year 1401.</P>
<P>The wits al&s;o of tho&s;e times did not &s;pare the gro&s;s morals of the clergy, but boldly ridiculed their ignorance and profligacy. The mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e were <HI>Chaucer,</HI> and his contemporary <HI>Robert Langelande,</HI> better known by the name of <HI>Piers Plowman.</HI> The laughable tales of the former are familiar to almo&s;t every reader; while the <HI>vi&s;ions</HI> of the latter are but in few hands. With a quotation from the <HI>Pa&s;&s;us Decimus</HI> of this writer I &s;hall conclude my letter; not only on account of the remarkable prediction therein contained, which carries with it &s;omewhat of the air of a prophecy; but al&s;o as it &s;eems to have been a &s;triking picture of mona&s;tic in&s;olence and di&s;&s;ipation; and a &s;pecimen of one of the keene&s;t pieces of &s;atire now perhaps &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in any language, ancient or modern.</P>

<P>After &s;ome altercation and di&s;pute they all came to an agree|ment with the new prior, that what had been done &s;hould be re|jected and annulled; and that they would again, for this turn, transfer to the bi&s;hop their power to elect, order, and provide them another prior, whom they promi&s;ed unanimou&s;ly to admit.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop accepted of this offer before witne&s;&s;es; and on <HI>September</HI> 27, in an inner chamber near the chapel abovemen|tioned, after full deliberation, cho&s;e brother <HI>Thomas Fairwi&s;e,</HI> vicar of <HI>Somborne,</HI> a canon-regular of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> in the Priory of <HI>Bru&s;cough,</HI> in the dioce&s;e of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield,</HI> to be prior of <HI>Selborne.</HI> The form is nearly as above in the la&s;t election.

<P>Thus did the bi&s;hop, three times out of the four that he was at liberty to nominate, appoint a prior from a di&s;tance, a &s;tranger to the place, to govern the convent of <HI>Selborne,</HI> hoping by this method to have broken the cabal, and to have interrupted that habit of mi&s;management that had pervaded the &s;ociety: but he acknowledges, in an evidence lying before us, that he never did &s;uceed to his wi&s;hes with re&s;pect to tho&s;e late governors,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"quos tamen male &s;e habui&s;&s;e, et inutiliter admini&s;trare, et admini|&s;tra&s;&s;e u&s;que ad pre&s;entia tempora po&s;t debitam inve&s;tigationem, &amp;c. invenit."</Q> The only time that he appointed from among the canons, he made choice of <HI>Peter Berne,</HI> for whom he had con|ceived the greate&s;t e&s;teem and regard.</P>
<P>When prior <HI>Berne</HI> fir&s;t relinqui&s;hed his prior&s;hip, he returned again to his former condition of canon, in which he continued for &s;ome years: but when he was re-cho&s;en, and had abdicated a &s;econd time, we find him in a &s;orlorn &s;tate, and in danger of being re|duced to beggary, had not the bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> interpo&s;ed in his favour, and with great humanity in&s;i&s;ted on a provi&s;ion for

him for life. The rea&s;on for this difference &s;eems to have been, that, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, though in years, he might have been hale and capable of taking his &s;hare in the duty of the convent; in the &s;econd, he was broken with age, and no longer equal to the func|tions of a canon.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with this idea the bi&s;hop very benevolently interceded in his favour, and laid his injunctions on the new-elected prior in the following manner.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the evidences and documents of the Priory and pari&s;h of <HI>Selborne</HI> are now at an end, yet, as the author has &s;till &s;everal things to &s;ay re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent &s;tate of that convent and it's <HI>Grange,</HI> and other matters, he does not &s;ee how he can acquit him&s;elf of the &s;ubject without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again on the patience of the reader by adding one &s;upplementary letter.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner did the Priory (perhaps much out of repair at the time) become an appendage to the college, but it mu&s;t at once have tended to &s;wift decay. <HI>Magdalen College</HI> wanted now only two chambers for the chantry prie&s;t and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant; and therefore had no occa&s;ion for the hall, dormitory, and other &s;pacious apart|ments belonging to &s;o large a foundation. The roofs neglected, would &s;oon become the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of daws and owls; and, being rotted and decayed by the weather, would fall in upon the floors; &s;o that all parts mu&s;t have ha&s;tened to &s;peedy dilapidation and a &s;cene of broken ruins. Three full centuries have now pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution; a &s;eries of years that would craze the &s;toute&s;t edifices. But, be&s;ides the &s;low hand of time, many circum&s;tances have contributed to level this venerable &s;tructure with the ground; of which nothing now remains but one piece of a wall of about ten feet long, and as many feet high, which probably was part of an out-hou&s;e. As early as the latter end of the reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> VII.
<PB N="422" REF="446">
we find that a farm-hou&s;e and two barns were built to the &s;outh of the Priory, and undoubtedly out of it's materials. Avarice again has much contributed to the overthrow of this &s;tately pile, as long as the tenants could make money of it's &s;tones or timbers. Wantonne&s;s, no doubt, has had a &s;hare in the demolition; for boys love to de&s;troy what men venerate and admire. A remark|able in&s;tance of this propen&s;ity the writer can give from his own knowledge. When a &s;choolboy, more than fifty years ago, he was eye-witne&s;s, perhaps a party concerned, in the undermining a portion of that fine old ruin at the north end of <HI>Ba&s;ing&s;toke</HI> town, well known by the name of <HI>Holy Gho&s;t Chapel.</HI> Very providentially the va&s;t fragment, which the&s;e thoughtle&s;s little engineers endea|voured to &s;ap, did not give way &s;o &s;oon as might have been ex|pected; but it fell the night following, and with &s;uch violence that it &s;hook the very ground, and, awakening the inhabit|ants of the neighbouring cottages, made them &s;tart up in their beds as if they had felt an earthquake. The motive for this dan|gerous attempt does not &s;o readily appear: perhaps the more danger the more honour, thought the boys; and the notion of doing &s;ome mi&s;chief gave a ze&s;t to the enterprize. As <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;ays upon an other occa&s;ion,
<Q><L>"It look'd &s;o like a &s;in it pleas'd the more."</L></Q></P>
<P>Had the Priory been only levelled to the &s;urface of the ground, the di&s;cerning eye of an antiquary might have a&s;certained it's <HI>ichnography,</HI> and &s;ome judicious hand might have developed it's dimen&s;ions. But, be&s;ides other ravages, the very foundations have been torn up for the repair of the highways: &s;o that the &s;ite of this convent is now become a rough, rugged pa&s;ture-field, full of
<PB N="423" REF="447">
hillocks and pits, choaked with nettles, and dwarf-elder, and trampled by the feet of the ox and the heifer.</P>
<P>As the tenant at the Priory was lately digging among the foundations, for materials to mend the highways, his labourers di&s;covered two large &s;tones, with which the farmer was &s;o plea&s;ed that he ordered them to be taken out whole. One of the&s;e proved to be a large <HI>Doric</HI> capital, worked in good ta&s;te; and the other a ba&s;e of a pillar; both formed out of the &s;oft free&s;tone of this di&s;|trict. The&s;e ornaments, from their dimen&s;ions, &s;eem to have be|longed to ma&s;&s;ive columns; and &s;hew that the church of this <HI>convent</HI> was a large and co&s;tly edifice. They were found in the &s;pace which has always been &s;uppo&s;ed to have contained the &s;outh tran&s;ept of the Priory church. Some fragments of large pila&s;ters were al&s;o found at the &s;ame time. The diameter of the capital was two feet three inches and an half; and of the column, where it had &s;tood on the ba&s;e, eighteen inches and three quarters.</P>
<P>Two years ago &s;ome labourers digging again among the ruins founded a &s;ort of rude thick va&s;e or urn of &s;oft &s;tone, containing about two gallons in mea&s;ure, on the verge of the brook, in the very &s;pot which tradition has always pointed out as having been the &s;ite of the convent kitchen. This clum&s;y uten&s;il<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">A judicious antiquary, who &s;aw this va&s;e, ob&s;erved, that it po&s;&s;ibly might have been a &s;tandard <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> between the mona&s;tery and it's tenants. The priory we have mentioned claimed the a&s;&s;ize of bread and beer in <HI>Selborne</HI> manor; and probably the adju&s;tment of dry mea&s;ures for grain, &amp;c.</NOTE>, whether in|tended for holy water, or whatever purpo&s;e, we were going to procure, but found that the labourers had ju&s;t broken it in pieces, and carried it out on the highways.</P>
<P><PB N="424" REF="448">
The Priory of <HI>Selborne</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this village a <HI>Grange,</HI> an u&s;ual appendage to manerial e&s;tates, where the fruits of their lands were &s;towed and laid up for u&s;e, at a time when men took the natural produce of their e&s;tates in kind. The man&s;ion of this &s;pot is &s;till called the <HI>Grange,</HI> and is the manor-hou&s;e of the convent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in this place. The author has conver&s;ed with very ancient people who remembered the old original <HI>Grange;</HI> but it has long given place to a modern farm-hou&s;e. <HI>Magdalen College</HI> holds a court-leet and court-baron<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">The time when this court is held is the mid-week between <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Whit&s;untide.</HI></NOTE> in the great wheat-barn of the &s;aid <HI>Grange,</HI> annually, where the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> u&s;ually &s;uperintends, attended by the <HI>bur&s;ar</HI> and <HI>&s;teward</HI> of the college.<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Owen Oglethorpe,</HI> pre&s;ident, &amp;c. an. <HI>Edw.

<P>The following uncommon pre&s;entment at the court is not un|worthy of notice. There is on the &s;outh &s;ide of the king's field, (a large common-field &s;o called) a con&s;iderable tumulus, or hillock, now covered with thorns and bu&s;hes, and known by the name of <HI>Kite's Hill,</HI> which is pre&s;ented, year by year, in court as not ploughed. Why this injunction is &s;till kept up re&s;pecting this &s;pot, which is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by arable land, may be a que&s;tion not ea&s;ily &s;olved, &s;ince the u&s;age has long &s;urvived the knowledge of the intention thereof. We can only &s;uppo&s;e that as the prior, be&s;ides <HI>thur&s;et</HI> and <HI>pillory,</HI> had al&s;o <HI>furcas,</HI> a power of life and death, that he might have re&s;erved this little eminence as the place of execution for delinquents. And there is the more rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;o, &s;ince a &s;pot ju&s;t by is called <HI>Gally</HI> [Gallows] hill.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="449">
The lower part of the village next the <HI>Grange,</HI> in which is a pond and a &s;tream, is well known by the name of <HI>Gracious &s;treet,</HI> an appellation not at all under&s;tood. There is a lake in <HI>Surrey,</HI> near <HI>Chobham,</HI> called al&s;o <HI>Gracious-pond:</HI> and another, if we mi&s;take not, near <HI>Hedleigh,</HI> in the county of <HI>Hants.</HI> This &s;trange deno|mination we do not at all comprehend, and conclude that it may be a corruption from &s;ome <HI>Saxon</HI> word, it&s;elf perhaps forgotten.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved already, that Bi&s;hop <HI>Tanner</HI> was mi&s;taken when he refers to an evidence of Dod&s;worth <Q REND="inline">"<HI>De mercatu et</HI> FERIA <HI>de Seleburne.</HI>"</Q> <HI>Selborne</HI> never had a chartered fair; the pre&s;ent fair was &s;et up &s;ince the year 1681, by a &s;et of jovial fellows, who had found in an old almanack that there had been a fair here in former days on the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and were de&s;irous to revive &s;o joyous a fe&s;tival. Again&s;t this innovation the vicar &s;et his face, and per&s;i&s;ted in crying it down, as the probable occa&s;ion of much in|temperance. However the fair prevailed; but was altered to the twenty-ninth of <HI>May,</HI> becau&s;e the former day often interfered with wheat-harve&s;t. On that day it &s;till continues to be held, and is be|come an u&s;eful mart for cows and calves. Mo&s;t of the lower hou&s;e-keepers brew beer again&s;t this holiday, which is dutied by the exci&s;eman; and their becoming victuallers for the day without a licen&s;e is overlooked.</P>
<P>Mona&s;teries enjoyed all &s;orts of conveniencies within them&s;elves. Thus at the Priory, a low and moi&s;t &s;ituation, there were ponds and &s;tews for their fi&s;h: at the &s;ame place al&s;o, and at the <HI>Grange</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Culver,</HI> as has been ob&s;erved before, is <HI>Saxon</HI> for a pigeon.</NOTE> in <HI>Culver-croft,</HI> there were dove-hou&s;es; and on the hill oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Grange</HI> the prior had a warren, as the names of <HI>The Coney-crofts</HI> and <HI>Coney-croft Hanger</HI> plainly te&s;tify<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">A warren was an u&s;ual appendage to a manor.</NOTE>.</P>

Nothing has been &s;aid as yet re&s;pecting the tenure or holding of the <HI>Selborne</HI> e&s;tates. <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Norton</HI> are manor farms and freehold; as is the manor of <HI>Chapel</HI> near <HI>Oakhanger,</HI> and al&s;o the e&s;tate at <HI>Oakhanger-hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Black-moor.</HI> The <HI>Priory</HI> and <HI>Grange</HI> are lea&s;ehold under <HI>Magdalen college,</HI> for twenty-one years, renew|able every &s;even: all the &s;maller e&s;tates in and round the village are copyhold of inheritance under the college, except the little remains of the <HI>Gurdon-manor,</HI> which had been of old lea&s;ed out upon lives, but have been freed of late by their pre&s;ent lord, as fa&s;t as tho&s;e lives have dropped.</P>
<P><HI>Selborne</HI> &s;eems to have derived much of it's pro&s;perity from the near neighbourhood of the Priory. For mona&s;teries were of con|&s;iderable advantage to places where they had their &s;ites and e&s;tates, by cau&s;ing great re&s;ort, by procuring markets and fairs, by freeing them from the cruel oppre&s;&s;ion of fore&s;t-laws, and by letting their lands at ea&s;y rates. But, as &s;oon as the convent was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the town which it had occa&s;ioned began to decline, and the market was le&s;s frequented; the rough and &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation gave a check to re&s;ort, and the neglected roads rendered it le&s;s and le&s;s acce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>That it had been a con&s;iderable place for &s;ize formerly appears from the largene&s;s of the church, which much exceeds tho&s;e of the neighbouring villages; by the ancient extent of the burying ground, which, from human bones occa&s;ionally dug up, is found to have been much encroached upon; by giving a name to the hundred; by the old foundations and ornamented &s;tones, and tracery of windows that have been di&s;covered on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the village; and by the many ve&s;tiges of di&s;u&s;ed fi&s;h-ponds &s;till to be &s;een around it.

He then walks on tip|toe, and is &s;tirring by five in the morning; and, traver&s;ing the gar|den, examines every wicket and inter&s;tice in the fences, through which he will e&s;cape if po&s;&s;ible: and often has eluded the care of the gardener, and wandered to &s;ome di&s;tant field. The motives that impel him to undertake the&s;e rambles &s;eem to be of the amo|rous kind: his fancy then becomes intent on &s;exual attachments, which tran&s;port him beyond his u&s;ual gravity, and induce him to forget for a time his ordinary &s;olemn deportment.</P>

<P>OF all the propen&s;ities of plants none &s;eem more &s;trange than their different periods of blo&s;&s;oming. Some produce their flowers in the winter, or very fir&s;t dawnings of &s;pring; many when the &s;pring is e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;ome at mid&s;ummer, and &s;ome not till au|tumn. When we &s;ee the <HI>helleborus foetidus</HI> and <HI>helleborus niger</HI> blowing at Chri&s;tmas, the <HI>helleborus hycmalis</HI> in January, and the <HI>helleborus viridis</HI> as &s;oon as ever it emerges out of the ground, we do not wonder, becau&s;e they are kindred plants that we expect &s;hould keep pace the one with the other. But other congenerous vegetables differ &s;o widely in their time of flowering, that we can|not but admire. I &s;hall only in&s;tance at pre&s;ent in the <HI>crocus &s;ativus,</HI> the vernal, and the autumnal crocus, which have &s;uch an affinity, that the be&s;t botani&s;ts only make them varieties of the &s;ame <HI>genus,</HI> of which there is only one <HI>&s;pecies;</HI> not being able to di&s;cern any difference in the <HI>corolla,</HI> or in the internal &s;tructure. Yet the <HI>vernal crocus</HI> expands it's flowers by the beginning of March at far|the&s;t, and often in very rigorous weather; and cannot be retarded but by &s;ome violence offered:&mdash;while the <HI>autumnal</HI> (the <HI>Saffron</HI>) defies the in&s;luence of the &s;pring and &s;ummer, and will not blow till mo&s;t plants begin to &s;ade and run to &s;eed. This circum&s;tance is one of the wonders of the creation, little noticed, becau&s;e a common occurrence; yet ought not to be overlooked on account
