<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Ode was written at the time of its date, and a few manu&s;cript copies of it then given to the Author's friends, with permi&s;&s;ion to circulate them among their ac|quaintance. A mode of publication which he adopted for the pre&s;ent, till an opportunity might offer it&s;elf of printing it in &s;ome future collection of his Poems; in which he hoped (more out of re&s;pect to the &s;ubject than to him&s;elf) that it might be pre&s;erved, as long as any thing he has written &s;hould merit pre&s;ervation. But, &s;ince an inaccurate copy has lately &s;tolen into a public new&s;paper; he has thought proper to print a more correct edition of it, in this &s;eperate form. For, while the enemys of Mr. Keppel &s;eem to attack his cau&s;e with increa&s;ing virulence, it is &s;urely right to continue the application of every hone&s;t antidote.</P>
