<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE affairs of America have lately en|gaged a great deal of the public attention. Before the pre&s;ent war there were but a very few who made the hi&s;tory of that quarter of the world any part of their &s;tudy; though the matter is certainly very curious in it&s;elf, and extremely intere&s;ting to us as a trading people.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of a country which, though va&s;t in extent, is the property of only four nations; and which, though peopled probably for a &s;eries of ages, is only known to the re&s;t of the world for about two centuries, does not naturally, af|ford matter for many volumes. Yet it is cer|tain, that to acquire a proper knowledge of the hi&s;tory of the events in America, an idea of it's pre&s;ent &s;tate, and a competent judgment of it's trade, a great deal of reading has been found requi&s;ite. And I may add, that the reading on many parts of this &s;ubject is dry and di&s;gu&s;ting; that authors have treated
<PB REF="5">
on it, &s;ome without a &s;ufficient knowledge of the &s;ubject, and others in &s;uch a manner as no knowledge of the &s;ubject in the author could in|duce any body to become readers. That &s;ome are loaded with a lumber of matter that can intere&s;t very few, and that others ob&s;cure the truth in many particulars, to gratify the low prejudices of parties, and I may &s;ay of nations. Whatever is written by the Engli&s;h &s;ettled in our colo|nies, is to be read with great caution; becau&s;e very few of them write without a bias to the intere&s;t of the particular province to which they belong, or perhaps to a particular faction in that province. It is only by comparing the printed accounts with one another, and tho&s;e with the be&s;t private informations, and correct|ing all by authentic matter of record, that one can di&s;cover the truth; and this hath been a matter of &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>With regard to the foreign &s;ettlements, re|cour&s;e was had to the be&s;t printed accounts of travellers and others; and in &s;ome points to private information from intelligent traders.
<PB REF="6">
The materials for the foreign &s;ettlements are far from being as perfect, or as much to be depended upon as we could wi&s;h; it was very &s;eldom that I could venture to tran&s;cribe any thing directly from them without &s;ome addition or &s;ome corrective.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;torical part of this work, I fixed my eye principally on &s;ome capital matters, which might the mo&s;t fully engage and be&s;t reward the attention of the reader; and in treating of tho&s;e I dwelt only upon &s;uch events as &s;eemed to me to afford &s;ome political in&s;truc|tion, or to open the characters of the principal actors in tho&s;e great &s;cenes. The affairs which &s;eemed mo&s;t worthy of an account of any length, are tho&s;e &s;plendid and remarkable events of the di&s;covery of America, and the conque&s;t of the only two civilized kingdoms it contained.</P>
<P>In treating of other parts, I have given &s;o much of the hi&s;tory of each country as may &s;erve to &s;hew, when and upon what principles it was planted, to enable the reader the better to judge
<PB REF="7">
of it's pre&s;ent condition. The&s;e accounts are very &s;hort; and con&s;idering of what &s;ort of matter their hi&s;tories are compo&s;ed, I believe I &s;hall de&s;erve as much for what I have omitted, as for what I have in&s;erted. If I could not write well upon any &s;ubject, I have endeavoured always to write conci&s;ely.</P>
<P>My principal view in treating of the &s;eve|ral &s;ettlements, was to draw every thing towards their trade, which is the point that concerns us the mo&s;t materially; for which rea&s;on I have but little con&s;idered their civil, and yet le&s;s their natural hi&s;tory, further than as they tended to throw &s;ome light upon the commerce of the&s;e countries; except where the matters were very curious, and &s;erved to diver&s;ify the work.</P>
<P>It is not to be expected that a performance of this kind can be written equally throughout. In &s;ome places the &s;ubject refu&s;es all ornament, and the matter, dry in it&s;elf, is by no art to be made otherwi&s;e: in &s;ome a contagion commu|nicated from the dulne&s;s of materials, which
<PB REF="8">
yet were nece&s;&s;ary to the work, may probably appear; in many, and perhaps the mo&s;t blame|able parts, the author alone mu&s;t be an&s;wer|able; however there are &s;ome errors of the pre&s;s, e&s;pecially towards the beginning, which are owing to the author's ab&s;ence from it.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken perhaps a little too hardly of my materials, I mu&s;t except the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have had from the judicious collection called Harris's voyages. There are not many finer pieces than the hi&s;tory of Brazil in that col|lection; the light in which the author &s;ets the events in that hi&s;tory is fine and in&s;tructive; an uncommon &s;pirit prevails through it; and his remarks are every where &s;triking and deep. The little &s;ketch I have given in the part of Portu|gue&s;e America, if it has any merit, it is entire|ly due to that original, However the accounts given of many things in that part of his work which relates to the Engli&s;h and French &s;ettlements may be defective, and &s;uited ra|ther to the ancient than to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs in that part of the world: his
<PB REF="9">
remarks have rarely this fault; and where I differ from him in any re&s;pect, it is with defe|rence to the judgment of a writer to whom this nation is much obliged, for endeavouring every where with &s;o much good &s;en&s;e and elo|quence to rouze that &s;pirit of generous enter|prize, that can alone make any nation powerful or glorious.</P>

AN ACCOUNT OF THE EUROPEAN SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA.</HEAD>

<PB N="3" REF="11">
<HEAD>PART I. The di&s;covery of America, and the reduction of Mexico and Peru.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE was an extraordinary coincidence of events at the time that the di&s;covery of America made one of the principal; the invention of printing, the making of gun-powder, the improvement of navigation, the revival of ancient learning, and the re|formation; all of the&s;e con&s;pired to change the face of Europe entirely. At this time the principal monarchies began to knit, and to acquire the &s;trength, and take the form they have at this day. Before this period the manners of Europe were wholly barbarous; even in Italy, where the natural mildne&s;s of the climate, and the dawning of literature had a little &s;often|ed the minds of the people, and introduced &s;omething approaching towards politene&s;s, the hi&s;tory preceding this aera, and indeed for &s;ome time after it, is nothing but one &s;eries of
<PB N="4" REF="12">
trea&s;ons, u&s;urpations, murders, and ma&s;&s;acres: nothing of a manly courage, nothing of a &s;olid and rational policy. Scarce any &s;tate had then very exten&s;ive views, or looked much further than to the pre&s;ent advantage. They did not well comprehend the complicated &s;y&s;tem of intere&s;ts that Europe formed even long before this. Lewis the eleventh, who was looked upon as one of the wi&s;e&s;t princes in his time, and one who &s;acrificed every thing to his am|bition, &s;acrificed one of the faire&s;t objects of that ambition to a pique, which &s;ince his time could have little influence on the coun&s;els of any prince. His &s;on, Charles the eighth, as he won Italy without either courage or con|duct, &s;o he lo&s;t it by a chain of fal&s;e mea&s;ures, &s;uch as we may venture to &s;ay has no parallel in later times. A wild romantic courage in the Northern and We&s;tern parts of Europe, and a wicked policy in the Italian &s;tates, was the character of that age. If we look into the manners of the courts, there appear but very faint marks of cultivation and politene&s;s. The interview between our Edward the fourth and his brother of France, wherein they were both caged up like wild bea&s;ts, &s;hews di&s;po&s;i|tions very remote from a true &s;en&s;e of honour, from the dignity of their &s;tation, or any ju&s;t ideas of politene&s;s and humanity. All the anecdotes which remain of the&s;e and other courts, are in the &s;ame &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13">If the courts had made &s;uch poor advances in policy and in politene&s;s, which might &s;eem the natural growth of courts at any time, both the courts and the people were yet le&s;s ad|vanced in u&s;eful knowledge. The little learning which then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, was only the dotage of the &s;chola&s;tick philo&s;ophy of words; together with the infancy of politer learning, which only concerned words too, tho' in another way. The elegance and purity of the Latin tongue was then the highe&s;t, and almo&s;t the only point of a &s;cholar's ambition. Mathe|matical learning was little valued or cultivated. The true &s;y&s;tem of the heavens was not dreamed of. There was no knowledge at all of the real form of the earth; and in general the ideas of mankind were not extended be|yond their &s;en&s;ible horizon.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of affairs Chri&s;topher Colum|bus, a native of Genoa, undertook to extend the boundaries which ignorance had given to the world. This man's de&s;ign aro&s;e from the ju&s;t idea he had formed of the figure of the earth; though the maps, more erroneous than his conjectures, made him mi&s;take the object. His de&s;ign was to find a pa&s;&s;age to China and India by the We&s;tern ocean. It is not im|probable, that be&s;ides the glory attending &s;uch a di&s;covery, and the private advantages of for|tune he might propo&s;e to derive from it, Co|lumbus had a further incentive from national
<PB N="6" REF="14">
jealou&s;y and re&s;entment. Venice and Genoa were then almo&s;t the only trading powers in Europe; and they had no other &s;upport of their power but their commerce. This bred a rival&s;hip, a jealou&s;y, and frequent wars be|tween them; but in traffick Venice was much &s;uperior; &s;he had drawn to her&s;elf al|mo&s;t the whole commerce of India, always one of the mo&s;t valuable in the world, and then carried on only by the way of Egypt and the Red Sea. An emulation of this kind might probably have put Columbus on finding ano|ther and more direct pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and by that means transferring this profitable trade to his own country. But neither that which he &s;ought, nor that which he found, was de&s;tined for his country. However, he performed the duty of a good citizen, and made his fir&s;t propo&s;al at home; at home it was rejected Di&s;charged of this obligation, he applied to the court of France, and meeting no better &s;ucce&s;s there, he offered next his &s;ervices to our Henry the &s;eventh. This prince was rather a prudent &s;teward and ma|nager of a kingdom than a great king, and one of tho&s;e defen&s;ive geniu&s;es who are the la&s;t in the world to reli&s;h a great but problematical de&s;ign. It is therefore no wonder that his brother, whom Columbus had employed to &s;ollicit in England, after &s;everal years &s;pent here, had little &s;ucce&s;s in his negotiation. But
<PB N="7" REF="15">
in Portugal, where he applied him&s;elf after his failure here, his offers were not only rejected, but he was in&s;ulted and ridiculed; he found, however, in the&s;e in&s;ults, and this ridicule, a new incitement to pur&s;ue his &s;cheme, urged forward by the &s;tings of anger and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all he exerci&s;ed his intere&s;t and his patience for eight years together at the court of Ferdinand and I&s;abella. There is a &s;ort of enthu&s;ia&s;m in all projectors, ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for their affairs, which makes them proof again&s;t the mo&s;t fatiguing delays, the mo&s;t mortifying di&s;appointments, the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing in&s;ults; and what is &s;everer than all, the pre&s;umptuous judgments of the ignorant upon their de&s;igns. Columbus had a &s;ufficient &s;hare of this quality. He had every day, during this long &s;pace, to combat with every objection that want of knowledge, or that a fal&s;e knowledge could propo&s;e. Some held that the known world, which they thought was all that could be known, floated like a va&s;t &s;cum upon the ocean; that the ocean it&s;elf was infinite. Others, who entertained more ju&s;t notions, and believed that the whole of the earth and waters compo&s;ed one va&s;t globe, drew a con&s;equence from it as ab&s;urd as the former opinion. For they argued, that if Columbus &s;hould &s;ail beyond a certain point, the convexity of this globe would prevent his return. As is u&s;ual in &s;uch cafes, every one
<PB N="8" REF="16">
abounded with objections. His whole time was &s;pent in fruitle&s;s endeavours to enlighten ignorance, to remove prejudice, and to van|qui&s;h that ob&s;tinate incredulity, which is of all others the greate&s;t enemy to improvement, rejecting every thing as fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, which is ever &s;o little out of the track of common ex|perience; and it is of the more dangerous con|&s;equence, as it carries a delu&s;ive air of coolne&s;s, of temper and wi&s;dom. With all this he had yet greater difficulties from the intere&s;ts of mankind, than from their malignity and igno|rance. The expence of the undertaking, in|con&s;iderable as this expence was, was at the bottom the chief &s;upport of the other ob|jections, and had more weight than all the re&s;t together. However, with an a&s;&s;iduity and firmne&s;s of mind, never enough to be admired and applauded, he at length overcame all diffi|culties; and, to his inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, with a fleets of three &s;hips, and the title and command of an admiral, &s;et &s;ail on the third of Augu&s;t, 1492, on a voyage the mo&s;t daring and grand in the de&s;ign, and in the event of which the world was the mo&s;t concerned of any that ever yet was undertaken.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted here, in honour to the &s;ex, and in ju&s;tice to I&s;abella, that this &s;cheme was fir&s;t countenanced, and the equip|ment made by the queen only; the king had no &s;hare in it; &s;he even rai&s;ed the mo|ney
<PB N="9" REF="17">
nece&s;&s;ary for the de&s;ign upon her own jewels.</P>
<P>I do not propo&s;e to relate all the particulars of Columbus's voyage in a track now &s;o well known, and &s;o much frequented; but then there was no chart to direct him, no lights from former navigators, no experience of the winds and currents peculiar to tho&s;e &s;eas. He had no guide but his own genius, nor any thing to comfort and appea&s;e his companions, di&s;couraged and mutinous with the length and hopele&s;sne&s;s of the voyage, but &s;ome indica|tions which he drew from the ca&s;ual appear|ances of land birds, and floating &s;ea-weeds, mo&s;t of them little to be depended upon, but which this wi&s;e commander, well acquainted with the human heart, always knew how to turn to the be&s;t advantage. It was in this expedition that the variation of the compa&s;s was fir&s;t ob&s;erved; an appearance which has ever &s;ince puzzled all philo&s;ophers, and which at this time made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon Columbus's pilots; when in an unknown and boundle&s;s ocean, far from the road of all for|mer navigation, nature it&s;elf &s;eemed altered, and the only guide they had left, appeared to be upon the point of for&s;aking them. But Columbus, with a wonderful quickne&s;s and &s;a|gacity, pretended to di&s;cover a phy&s;ical cau&s;e for this appearance, which, though it did not &s;atisfy him&s;elf, was plau&s;ible enough to remove
<PB N="10" REF="18">
&s;omething of the terror of his mariners. Ex|pedients of this kind were daily wanting, and the fertile genius of this di&s;coverer invented them daily. At la&s;t by u&s;e they began to lo&s;e their effect; the crew in&s;i&s;ted on his returning, and grew loud and in&s;olent in their demand. They even talked of throwing him overboard. Even his own invention, and almo&s;t his hopes were near exhau&s;ted, when the only thing which could appea&s;e them happened, the clear di&s;covery of land, after a voyage of thirty-three days, the longe&s;t ever any man was known to be from &s;ight of &s;hore before that time.</P>
<P>They landed on one of the i&s;lands now called Lucayos, or Bahamas, which is remark|able for nothing but this event, and here it was, that the two worlds, if I may u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, were fir&s;t introduced to one another; a meeting of an extraordinary nature, and which produced great changes in both. The fir&s;t thing Columbus did, after thanking God for the &s;ucce&s;s of his important voyage, was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land in the name of their Catholick maje&s;ties, by &s;etting up a cro&s;s upon the &s;hore; great multitudes of the inhabi|tants looking on, ignorant and unconcerned at a ceremony which was to deprive them of na|tural liberty. The &s;tay of the Spaniards in this i&s;land was but &s;hort; they found from the extreme poverty of the people, that this was
<PB N="11" REF="19">
by no means the Indies, which they &s;ought for.</P>
<P>Columbus at his departure very prudently took with him &s;ome of the natives, that they might learn the Spani&s;h tongue, and be his guides and interpreters in this new &s;cene of affairs; nor were they unwilling to accom|pany him. He touched on &s;everal of the i&s;lands in the &s;ame clu&s;ter, enquiring every where for gold, which was the only object of commerce he thought worth his care, becau&s;e the only thing that could give the court of Spain an high opinion of his di&s;coveries. All directed him to a great i&s;land called Bohio, of which they &s;poke extraordinary things, and principally that it abounded in gold. They told him it lay to the Southward: to the Southward he &s;teered his cour&s;e, and found the i&s;land, which he called Hi&s;paniola, no ways inferior to the reports; commodious har|bours, an agreeable climate, a good &s;oil, and, what was of mo&s;t con&s;equence, a country that promi&s;ed from &s;ome &s;amples a great abundance of gold; inhahited by an humane and ho&s;pitable people, in a &s;tate of &s;implicity fit to be worked upon. The&s;e circum&s;tances determined Co|lumbus to make this i&s;land the center of his de&s;igns, to plant a colony there, and to e&s;tabli&s;h things in &s;ome permanent order before he pro|ceeded to further di&s;coveries. But to carry his de&s;igns of a &s;ettlement here, and his &s;chemes of
<PB N="12" REF="20">
future di&s;coveries into execution, it was nece&s;|&s;ary that he &s;hould return to Spain and equip him&s;elf with a proper force. He had now collected a &s;ufficient quantity of gold to give credit to his voyage at court, and &s;uch a num|ber of curio&s;ities of all kinds as might &s;trike the imaginations, and engage the attention of the people. Before he parted, he took care to &s;ecure the friend&s;hip of the principal king of the i&s;land by care&s;&s;es and pre&s;ents, and under pretence of leaving him a force &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t his enemies, he laid the ground-work of a colony. He built a fort, and put a &s;mall garri&s;on of Spaniards into it, with &s;uch directions for their conduct as might en|&s;ure their &s;afety and the good offices of the inhabitants, if the men had not been of that kind, who are incapable of acting prudently either from their own or other people's wi&s;dom. He did every thing to gain the e&s;teem of the natives, by the ju&s;tice, and even genero&s;ity of his dealings, and the politene&s;s and humanity with which he behaved upon every occa&s;ion. He &s;hewed them too, that though it was not in his will, it was not the le&s;s in his power to do them mi&s;chief, if they acted &s;o as to force him upon har&s;her mea&s;ures. The &s;urprizing effects of his cannon, and the &s;harpne&s;s of the Spanish &s;words, of which he made an innocent o&s;tentation, convinced them of this.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="21">When the Spaniards fir&s;t arrived in that country, they were taken for men come from heaven; and it was no wonder, con&s;idering the extreme novelty of their appearance, and the prodigious &s;uperiority they had in every re&s;pect over a people in all the nakedne&s;s of mere nature. Whatever therefore the Indians got from them, they valued in an high de|gree, not only as curious and u&s;eful, but even as things &s;acred; and the per&s;ons of the Spaniards were re&s;pected in the &s;ame light. Columbus, who knew the value of opinion, did all he could to keep them in their error; and indeed no action of his, either of weak|ne&s;s or cruelty, could furni&s;h matter to unde|ceive them. For which rea&s;on, on his depar|ture, he left the people with the be&s;t inclina|tions imaginable to nur&s;e his infant colony. And when he de&s;ired &s;ome of the inhabitants to carry into Spain, he was more at a lo&s;s whom he &s;hould accept, than how he &s;hould prevail upon them to go.</P>

<P>ON his return homewards, &s;till attentive to his de&s;ign, he aimed at &s;uch di&s;coveries as could be pro&s;ecuted without deviating con|&s;iderably from his cour&s;e. He touched upon &s;everal i&s;lands to the Southward, and di&s;co|vered the Caribbees, of the barbarity of who&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="22">
inhabitants he had heard terrible accounts in Hi&s;paniola. He had before landed upon Cu|ba in his pa&s;&s;age from the Bahamas. So that in this his fir&s;t voyage, he gained a general knowledge of all the i&s;lands, which lie in &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing number in that great &s;ea which divides North and South America. But hither|to he neither knew nor &s;u&s;pected any conti|nent between him and China.</P>
<P>He returned to Europe after an ab&s;ence of above &s;ix months, and was driven by a great &s;torm into the harbour of Li&s;bon. This he did not look upon as a misfortune; &s;ince here, he had the &s;atisfaction of convincing the Por|tugue&s;e demon&s;tratively of what an error they were guilty in rejecting his propo&s;als. It was now his turn to triumph. Tho&s;e who want &s;agacity to di&s;cern the advantages of an offer, when it is made to them&s;elves, and treat it with the greate&s;t &s;corn, are always mo&s;t &s;tung with envy when they actually &s;ee the&s;e advan|tages in the hands of another. The Portu|gue&s;e had &s;ome time before this begun to make a figure: their &s;hips had coa&s;ted Africa for a greater length than any had done before them, which opened to them a profitable trade to Guinea. This gave them a reputation. They con&s;idered di&s;covery as their proper pro|vince; and they were enraged to &s;ee that the Ca&s;tilians were now let into the &s;ame path, in con&s;equence of an offer which they had re|jected.
<PB N="15" REF="23">
Some propo&s;ed to murder the ad|miral; but all were agreed to treat him in the mo&s;t unworthy manner. However, their de|&s;ign of in&s;ulting him gave Columbus an oppor|tunity at once of gratifying his re&s;entment, maintaining his own dignity, and a&s;&s;erting the honour of the flag of Ca&s;tile. He &s;ent to the king at his fir&s;t entering the harbour, to de|&s;ire a liberty to come up to Li&s;bon and refre&s;h, as he had his ma&s;ter's orders not to avoid his ports; adding, that he was not from Guinea, but the Indies. An officer of the king of Por|tugal came aboard him with an armed force, and ordered him to come a&s;hore, and give an account of him&s;elf to the king's officers. Co|lumbus told him he had the honour of &s;erving the king of Ca&s;tile, and would own him&s;elf accountable to no other. The Portugue&s;e then de&s;ired him to &s;end the ma&s;ter of his &s;hip; this he likewi&s;e refu&s;ed, &s;aying, that the admirals of Ca&s;tile always cho&s;e rather to die than deliver up them&s;elves, or even the meane&s;t of their men; and if violence was intended, he was prepared to meet force with force. A &s;pirited behaviour, in almo&s;t any circum&s;tance of &s;trength, is the mo&s;t politick as well as the mo&s;t honourable cour&s;e; we pre&s;erve a re&s;pect at lea&s;t by it, and with that we generally pre&s;erve every thing; but when we lo&s;e re&s;pect, every thing is lo&s;t. We invite rather than &s;uffer in|&s;ults, and the fir&s;t is the only one we can re&s;i&s;t

with prudence. Columbus found this; the of|ficer did not pur&s;ue his demands; the admiral had all the refre&s;hments he wanted; and was even received at court with particular marks of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>From Li&s;bon he proceeded to Seville; the court was then at Barcelona. But before he went to give an account of his voyage, he took all the care he could to provide for ano|ther. He wrote an ab&s;tract of his proceedings, and &s;ent with it a memorial of all &s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a co|lony, and for further di&s;coveries; &s;oon after he began his journey to Barcelona, every where followed by the admiration and applau&s;es of the people, who crowded to &s;ee him from all parts. He entered the city in a &s;ort of triumph; there never was a more innocent triumph, nor one that formed a more new and plea&s;ing &s;pectacle. He had not de&s;troyed, but di&s;co|vered nations. The Americans he had brought with him appeared in all the uncouth finery of their own country, wonder'd at by every body, and them&s;elves admiring every thing they &s;aw. The &s;everal animals, many highly beautiful, and all &s;trangers to this part of the world, were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to be &s;een without difficulty; the other curio&s;ities of the new world were di&s;played in the mo&s;t advantage|ous manner; the uten&s;ils, the arms, and the ornaments of a people &s;o remote from us in
<PB N="17" REF="25">
&s;ituation and manners; &s;ome valuable for the materials; even the rudene&s;s of the workman|&s;hip in many made them the more curious, when it was con&s;idered by whom, and with what in&s;truments they were wrought. The gold was not forgot. The admiral him&s;elf clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion. He was received by the king and queen with all imaginable marks of e&s;teem and regard, and they ordered a magnifi|cent throne to be erected in publick to do him the greater honour. A chair was prepared for him, in which he &s;at, and gave in pre&s;ence of the whole court a full and circum&s;tantial ac|count of all his di&s;coveries, with that com|po&s;edne&s;s and gravity, which is &s;o extremely agreeable to the Spani&s;h humour, and with the mode&s;ty of a man who knows he has done things which do not need to be proclaimed by him&s;elf. The &s;ucce&s;sful merit of Colum|bus was now under&s;tood by every body, and when the king and queen led the way, all the grandees and nobility of the court vied with each other in their civilities and care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e honours did not &s;atisfy Columbus. He prepared with all expedition for a &s;econd voyage. The difficulties attending the fir&s;t were all vani&s;hed. The importance of the object appeared every day more clearly, and the court was willing to &s;econd the vivacity of his de&s;ires to the full. But before his depar|ture there was one thing which they judged
<PB N="18" REF="26">
wanting to give them a clear and unque&s;tion|able right to the countries, which &s;hould be di&s;covered. This was a grant of them from the pope. The Portugue&s;e &s;ome time before had a grant of &s;uch lands as they &s;hould di&s;cover within certain latitudes; and this grant made a &s;imilar one to the Spaniards more nece&s;&s;ary. The pope accordingly gave a very ample bull in their favour, very liberally conceding coun|tries, of which he was &s;o far from having any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that he had no knowledge of them. The limits of this grant was a line drawn from pole to pole, an hundred leagues to the We&s;t|ward of the Azores; on the other &s;ide no bounds at all were &s;et. This was afterwards a &s;ubject of much controver&s;y between the crowns of Spain and Portugal, the latter having got a grant of all that &s;hould be di&s;covered to the Ea&s;t, as the former had of all to the We&s;t|ward; tho&s;e who drew the bulls not having known enough of the figure of the earth to &s;ee, that the&s;e grants mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cla&s;h with one another: and the powers which de|&s;ired them, were perhaps not &s;orry to find their preten&s;ions &s;uch as they might extend or contract at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Whatever the validity of this ample grant might be, Columbus was made governor with the highe&s;t authority over all that it contained. But he had &s;omewhat with him more material for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion than any charters; this was
<PB N="19" REF="27">
a fleet of &s;eventeen &s;ail of &s;hips, with all man|ner of nece&s;&s;aries for &s;ettlement or conque&s;t, and fifteen hundred men on board, &s;ome of them of the be&s;t families in Spain. With this fleet he &s;et &s;ail on his &s;econd voyage the 25th of September, 1493. He gave each of the captains in&s;tructions for their cour&s;e &s;ealed, with orders not to open them, unle&s;s in di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;eparated from the fleet, that he might create &s;uch an ab&s;olute dependence of all up|on him&s;elf as &s;hould pre&s;erve an uniformity in their de&s;igns. On the &s;econd of November they made land, which is the i&s;land now called Dominica. But his de&s;ign was fir&s;t to &s;ettle his colony before he attempted any new di&s;covery, therefore he made no &s;tay here, nor at &s;everal other i&s;lands at which he touch|ed before he could make Hi&s;paniola.</P>
<P>On his arrival he found the fort he had built utterly demoli&s;hed, and all his men killed. They had fir&s;t fallen out among&s;t them&s;elves, upon the u&s;ual &s;ubjects of &s;trife, women and gold; and afterwards pre&s;erving as little harmony with the natives, and ob&s;erving no decency in their behaviour, or ju&s;tice in their dealings, they quickly lo&s;t their e&s;teem, and were every man murdered, after having been di&s;per&s;ed into different parts of the i&s;land. The prince, whom they were left to defend, was him&s;elf wounded in their defence, and bore this mark of his affection and good faith,
<PB N="20" REF="28">
when Columbus returned to the i&s;land. The admiral very wi&s;ely forbore to make any nice enquiry into the affair, or to commence ho&s;ti|lities in revenge for the lo&s;s of his &s;oldiers; but he took the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to prevent &s;uch an evil for the future; he cho&s;e a more commodious &s;tation for his colony, on the North-Ea&s;t part of the i&s;land, which had a good port, great conveniency of water, and a good &s;oil, and lay near that part where he was informed the riche&s;t mines of the country were found: in gratitude to his royal patrone&s;s he called it I&s;abella. He engaged in the &s;et|tlement with great warmth, and never allowed him&s;elf a moment's repo&s;e from &s;uperintending the fortifications, the private hou&s;es, and the works of agriculture; in all which the fatigue was infinite; for he had not only the natural difficulties attending all &s;uch undertakings, but he had the in&s;uperable lazine&s;s of the Spaniards to contend with. So that &s;pent with the fa|tigues of &s;o long a voyage, and the greater fa|tigues he had endured &s;ince he came on &s;hore, he fell into a dangerous illne&s;s. Of this acci|dent numberle&s;s of his men took the advantage to begin a rebellion, to undo all he had done, and to throw every thing into the mo&s;t terrible confu&s;ion. The&s;e people on their leaving Spain, had fancied to them&s;elves that gold was to be found every where in this country, and that there required nothing further to make
<PB N="21" REF="29">
ample e&s;tates, than to be tran&s;ported into it; but finding their mi&s;take, and that in&s;tead of receiving the&s;e golden &s;howers without any pains, they fared ill, laboured hard, and that their pro&s;pects of it in future, if any at all, were emote and uncertain, their di&s;content was general; and the mutinous di&s;po&s;ition increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, and was carried to &s;uch extremities, that if the admiral had not recovered at a very criti|cal time, and on his recovery had not acted in the mo&s;t re&s;olute and effectual manner, all his hopes of a &s;ettlement in Hi&s;paniola had been at an end. He was &s;atisfied with impri&s;oning &s;ome of the chiefs. This was neither a time or place for very exten&s;ive or rigorous ju&s;tice. He quelled this &s;edition, but he &s;aw at the &s;ame time that his work was not yet done; he &s;aw another danger, again&s;t which he was to provide with equal diligence. He had good rea&s;ons to apprehend, that the Americans were not well affected to their new gue&s;ts, and might probably meditate to cut them off, whil&s;t they &s;aw them divided among&s;t them|&s;elves. To prevent this, as well as to bani&s;h idlene&s;s from among&s;t his men, and to revive military di&s;cipline, he marched into the heart of the country, through the mo&s;t frequented parts of it, in order of battle, colours flying, and trumpets &s;ounding, with the flower of his troops, to the mountains of Cibao; where lay the
<PB N="22" REF="30">
riche&s;t mines then di&s;covered in the i&s;land. Here he built a fort to &s;ecure this advantage|ous po&s;t, and overawe the country; and then he returned in the &s;ame pomp and order, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible terror of the inhabitants, who had now no pro&s;pect of with&s;tanding a force, which to them &s;eemed more than human.</P>
<P>In this expedition Columbus made great o&s;tentation of his cavalry. This was the fir&s;t time the Indians of America had ever &s;een hor&s;es. Their dread of the&s;e animals and their riders were extreme; they thought both form|ed but one animal, and the impetuo&s;ity of their charge appeared irre&s;i&s;tible to the&s;e naked and ill-armed people. Wherever they appeared, tho&s;e Indians, who intended any ho&s;tility, im|mediately fled; nor did they think the inter|vention of the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t rapid rivers any &s;ecurity; they believed that the hor&s;es could fly, and that nothing was impo&s;&s;ible to creatures &s;o extraordinary. But Columbus did not rely upon tho&s;e prejudices, though he made all imaginable u&s;e of them, knowing that tho&s;e things which appear mo&s;t terrible at fir&s;t, become every day le&s;s affecting by u&s;e, and that they even grow contemptible, when their real power is once well known, for which rea&s;on he neglected none of his former methods of cultivating the affections of the natives; he &s;till &s;hewed them all manner of re&s;pect, and when he had taken two per&s;ons of
<PB N="23" REF="31">
their nation, who had committed &s;ome acts of ho&s;tility, and was at the point of putting them to death, he pardoned and &s;et them free at the interce&s;&s;ion of a prince of the country, with whom he was in alliance. On the other hand, he &s;aw how nece&s;&s;ary it was to pre&s;erve a &s;trict di&s;cipline among&s;t the Spaniards, to keep them from that idlene&s;s to which they had &s;uch a propen&s;ity, and which naturally re|tarded the growth of the colony, at the &s;ame time that it nouri&s;hed di&s;content and &s;edition. He employed them in cutting roads through the country, a work which the natives never attempted them&s;elves, nor now endeavoured to oppo&s;e, though it be one of the be&s;t in&s;tru|ments of en&s;laving any barbarous people. This wi&s;e governor ob&s;erved be&s;ides, that the Spaniards conformed with great difficulty to the Indian manner of living, to which, how|ever, they were nece&s;&s;itated, but from which, for want of u&s;e, they &s;uffered great hard&s;hips. To remedy this evil, he daily &s;ent out &s;mall parties upon expeditions into the country; from which he derived two material advan|tages. Fir&s;t, he enured, by degrees, all his peo|ple to the manner of living in the country; and &s;econdly, he taught them to know it per|fectly, le&s;t a war &s;hould find them unprovided in the only point in which the Indians were their &s;uperiors, and a point which in a woody and mountainous country is certainly of the
<PB N="24" REF="32">
greate&s;t importance. All this he did without any material hazard to the &s;um of his affairs. At home he endeavoured to withdraw the Spaniards from their romantick hopes of mi|raculous trea&s;ures, and to fix them to a rational and indu&s;trious cour&s;e of life. He repre&s;ent|ed to them, that there was no real wealth but what aro&s;e from labour; and that a garden, a corn ground, and a mill, were riches more to their pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, than all the gold they were in expectation of meeting in the Indies. In &s;hort, he laboured for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this colony with as much a&s;&s;iduity, as though his views had extended no further; at the &s;ame time that he meditated the greate&s;t di&s;coveries, and con&s;idered tho&s;e things which had a&s;to|ni&s;hed the world, only as the earne&s;t of his future performances.</P>
<P>I have before mentioned his having put in at Cuba. He had rea&s;on to believe this a place no way contemptible in point of wealth; and with regard to its extent, he was not certain whether it was an i&s;land, or a part of &s;ome great continent. But now that he had got his colony to take firm root in the Indies, he prepared with all expedition to a&s;certain this, and to pu&s;h his di&s;coveries to the utmo&s;t, in which he had &s;ucceeded hitherto &s;o happily.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THIS voyage was more remarkable for the hard&s;hips which the admiral and his men &s;uffered, than for any con&s;iderable di&s;co|very it produced. As he endeavoured to coa&s;t along the Southern &s;hore of Cuba, he was en|tangled in a labyrinth of an innumerable mul|titude of i&s;lands, among&s;t which he reckoned 160 in one day. They were mo&s;t of them plea&s;ant and well inhabited, affording our na|vigator an agreeable meditation on this fertility of nature, where the world looked for nothing but a barren ocean. The&s;e i&s;lands, perhaps the mo&s;t numerous in the world, Columbus, who had a grateful mind, in which the memory of his benefactre&s;s was always uppermo&s;t, called Jardin de la Reyna, or the queen's garden, in honour of queen I&s;abella. But their number and fertility made little amends for the ob|&s;truction they gave Columbus in the cour&s;e of his navigation: the coa&s;t ab&s;olutely unknown, among &s;o many rocks, &s;ands, and &s;helves, the &s;udden and violent &s;torms, the tornadoes, and the terrible thunder and lightning &s;o con&s;tant be|tween the tropicks, obliged him to keep a con|tinual watch, and held his mind upon a con|&s;tant &s;tretch; the voyage was extended to an unprofitable length by the&s;e difficulties, and being driven out to &s;ea, the wor&s;t di&s;a&s;ter of
<PB N="26" REF="34">
all befel them. Their provi&s;ions fell &s;hort. In this extremity they were obliged to come to a very narrow and bad allowance, in the di&s;|tribution of which the admiral fared nothing better than the re&s;t. In this extremity of fatigue of body and of mind, in famine and in danger, his u&s;ual firmne&s;s began nearly to for&s;ake him; but it could go no further than to oblige him to remark in his journal, that no intere&s;t of his own &s;hould ever oblige him to engage again in &s;uch an enterpri&s;e. They were at la&s;t relieved by the appearance of Ja|maica, where they were ho&s;pitably received, and &s;upplied with Ca&s;&s;ava bread and water. From thence they proceeded, mortified and di&s;appointed, to Hi&s;paniola, not being able to come to any certainty concerning Cuba, other than that they under&s;tood from &s;ome of the inhabitants that it was an i&s;land. This di&s;ap|pointment, and the infinite fatigue and diffi|culty of the voyage, threw Columbus into a lethargy, which was near being fatal to him, and of which he was &s;carcely recovered when they arrived at the harbour of I&s;abella.</P>
<P>Here they found all things in confu&s;ion, and the colony in the utmo&s;t danger of being a &s;econd time utterly de&s;troyed, as if its pro&s;peri|ty or de&s;truction depended upon the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of Columbus. For no &s;ooner was he &s;ailed, than the Spaniards, who were very difficultly retained in their duty by all his &s;tea|dine&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="35">
and wi&s;dom, broke through all regu|lations, laughed at government and di&s;ci|pline, and &s;pread them&s;elves over the i&s;land, committing a thou&s;and di&s;orders, and living at free quarter upon the inhabitants, who&s;e ha|tred to them was worked up to &s;uch a point, that they wanted only the word from their princes to fall on and ma&s;&s;acre the whole co|lony; a thing by no means impractiable, in it's pre&s;ent di&s;order. Four of the principal &s;overeigns of the i&s;land took advantage of this di&s;po&s;ition, and united to drive out tho&s;e impe|rious intruders. None adhered to them but one called Gunacagarry, the &s;ame prince whom Columbus from the fir&s;t had taken &s;o much plea&s;ure to oblige. In his dominions &s;ome of the Spaniards found protection. The other princes had already commenced ho&s;tilities, and one of them killed &s;ixteen of the Spaniards, who were taking no uniform mea&s;ures to op|po&s;e them, nor in their pre&s;ent anarchy could it be well expected.</P>
<P>In this condition was the i&s;land on the ar|rival of Columbus, who&s;e fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to collect the &s;cattered fragments of the colony, and to form them into a body; this he was the better able to accompli&s;h, becau&s;e the pre|&s;ent danger added a weight to his authority; but it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould lo&s;e no time. He was re&s;olved to act with what force he had, rather than wait until the union of the i&s;landers
<PB N="28" REF="36">
might be better cemented again&s;t him, and they might find &s;ome le&s;&s;er matters in their favour to rai&s;e their courage, and abate their terror of the Spani&s;h arms. He therefore marched again&s;t the king, who had killed the 16 Spaniards, as having a greater appearance of ju&s;tice, and be|cau&s;e he happened to be wor&s;e prepared to re|ceive him than the others. He was ea&s;ily &s;ub|dued, and &s;everal of his &s;ubjects &s;ent pri&s;oners into Spain. The &s;econd whom he de&s;igned to attack being better prepared again&s;t force, he was re&s;olved to circumvent him by fraud, and got him into his power by a &s;tratagem, which did no honour to his &s;incerity, and rather &s;hewed great weakne&s;s in this unfortu|nate barbarian, than any extraordinary contri|vance in tho&s;e who deceived him.</P>
<P>The other princes were not terrified at the&s;e examples. Their hatred to the Spaniards in|crea&s;ed, and perceiving that all depended upon a &s;udden and vigorous exertion of their &s;trength; they brought an immen&s;e army, it is &s;aid of one hundred thou&s;and men, into the field, which was arrayed in the large&s;t plain in that country. Columbus, though he had but a &s;mall force, did not &s;cruple to go out to meet them. His army con&s;i&s;ted but of two hun|dred foot, twenty hor&s;e and twenty wolf dogs. The latter part of this army has a ludicrous appearance; but it was a very &s;erious matter
<PB N="29" REF="37">
among&s;t a people no better provided with arms offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive than the Indians. Neither was it ra&s;h in Columbus to venture an engagement with forces &s;o va&s;tly &s;uperior in numbers; for when &s;uch numbers are no bet|ter &s;killed or armed than the&s;e were, their mul|titude is in fact no ju&s;t cau&s;e of dread but to them&s;elves. The event was an&s;werable; the victory was deci&s;ive for the Spaniards, in which their hor&s;es and dogs had a con&s;iderable &s;hare; the lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Indians was very great; and from that day forward they de&s;pair|ed, and relinqui&s;hed all thoughts of di&s;lodging the Spaniards by force. Columbus had but little difficulty in reducing the whole i&s;land, which now became a province of Spain, had a tri|bute impo&s;ed, and forts built in &s;everal parts to enforce the levying of it, and to take away from this unhappy people all pro&s;pect of liberty.</P>
<P>In this affecting &s;ituation they often a&s;ked the Spaniards, when they intended to return to their own country. Small as the number of the&s;e &s;trangers was, the inhabitants were ex|tremely burthened to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them. One Spa|niard con&s;umed more than ten Indians; a cir|cum&s;tance which &s;hews how little this people had advanced in the art of cultivating the earth, or how lazy they were in doing it, &s;ince their indigence reduced them to &s;uch an extreme frugality, that they found the Spani|niards,
<PB N="30" REF="38">
who are the mo&s;t ab&s;temious people upon earth, exce&s;&s;ively voracious in the compari|&s;on. Their ob&s;ervation of this, joined to their de&s;pair, put the Indians upon a project of &s;tarving out their invaders. In pur&s;uance of this &s;cheme, they entirely abandoned the little agriculture which they practi&s;ed, and unani|mou&s;ly retired into the mo&s;t barren and impracticable parts of the i&s;land. This ill-advi&s;ed &s;tratagem compleated their ruin. A number of people crouded into the wor&s;t parts of the country, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only upon it's &s;pontaneous productions, were &s;oon reduced to the mo&s;t terrible famine. It's &s;ure atten|dant epidemical &s;ickne&s;s pur&s;ued at it's heels; and this mi&s;erable people, half fami&s;hed and le&s;&s;ened a third of their numbers, were obliged to relinqui&s;h their &s;cheme, to come down into the open country, and to &s;ubmit once more to bread and fetters.</P>
<P>This conque&s;t, and the &s;ub&s;equent ones made by the &s;everal European nations, with as little colour of right as con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing any thing wrong, gives one ju&s;t rea&s;on to reflect on the notions entertained by mankind in all times concerning the right of dominion. At this period few doubted of the power of the pope to convey a full right to any country he was plea&s;ed to chalk out; among&s;t the faith|ful, becau&s;e they were &s;ubject to the church; and among&s;t infidels, becau&s;e it was meritorious
<PB N="31" REF="39">
to make them &s;ubject to it. This notion began to lo&s;e ground at the reformation, but ano|ther aro&s;e of as bad a tendency; the idea of the dominion of grace, which prevailed with &s;e|veral, and the effects of which we have felt a|mong&s;t our&s;elves. The Mahometan great merit is to &s;pread the empire and the faith; and none among them doubt the legality of &s;ubduing any nation for the&s;e good purpo&s;es. The Greeks held, that the barbarians were naturally de|&s;igned to be their &s;laves, and this was &s;o general a notion, that Ari&s;totle him&s;elf, with all his pe|netration, gave into it very &s;eriou&s;ly. In truth, it has it's principle in human nature, for the generality of mankind very readily &s;lide from what they conceive a fitne&s;s for government, to a right of governing; and they do not &s;o readi|ly agree, that tho&s;e who are &s;uperior in endow|ments &s;hould only be equal in condition. The&s;e things partly palliate the guilt and horror of a conque&s;t, undertaken with &s;o little colour, over a people who&s;e chief offence was their creduli|ty, and their confidence in men who did not de&s;erve it. But the circum&s;tances Columbus was in, the mea&s;ures he was obliged to pre|&s;erve with his court, and his humane and gentle treatment of this people, by which he mitigated the rigor of this conque&s;t, take off much of the blame from him, as the nece&s;&s;ity of taking up arms at all never aro&s;e from his conduct, or from his orders. On the contrary,
<PB N="32" REF="40">
his whole behaviour both to the Spaniards and Indians, the care he took to e&s;tabli&s;h the one without injury to the other, and the con&s;tant bent of his policy to work every thing by gentle methods, may well be an example to all per&s;ons in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Since I have digre&s;&s;ed &s;o far, it will be the more excu&s;able to mention a circum&s;tance re|corded in the hi&s;tory of this &s;ettlement. Ame|rica was then, at lea&s;t the&s;e parts of it, with|out almo&s;t any of tho&s;e animals by which we profit &s;o greatly. It had neither hor&s;es nor oxen, nor &s;heep, nor &s;wine. Columbus brought eight &s;ows into America, and a &s;mall number of horned cattle. This was the &s;tock which &s;upplied, about two hundred years ago, a country now the mo&s;t abounding in the&s;e animals of any part of the known world; in which too it has been a bu&s;ine&s;s for this cen|tury pa&s;t, to hunt oxen merely for their hides, An example which &s;hews how &s;mall a number might originally have &s;erved to produce all the animals upon earth, who commonly procre|ate very fa&s;t to a certain point, and there &s;eem very much at a &s;tand.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST Columbus was reducing this wealthy i&s;land to the obedience of the crown of Ca&s;tile, and laying the foundations of the Spani&s;h grandeur in America, his enemies were endeavouring with pains as indefatigable to ruin him in Spain. Some of the per&s;ons principally concerned in the late di&s;orders, fled to Spain before his return; and there to ju&s;tify their own conduct, and gratify their malice, accu&s;ed him of neglecting the colony, and of having deceived their maje&s;ties and the adven|turers with fal&s;e hopes of gold, from a country which produced very little either of that or any thing el&s;e that was valuable. The&s;e com|plaints were not without effect, and an officer, fitter by his character for a &s;py and informer than a redre&s;&s;er of grievances, was &s;ent to in|&s;pect into his conduct; in which manner of proceeding there was certainly a policy as erro|neous, as it was unju&s;t and ingrateful. At that di&s;tance from the fountain of authority, with an enemy at the door, and a mutinous hou&s;e|hold, a commander ought always to be tru&s;ted or removed. This man behaved in a bruti&s;h and in&s;olent manner, like all &s;uch per&s;ons, who uncon&s;cious of any merit of their own, are puffed up with any little portion of dele|gated power. Columbus found that he &s;taid here to no purpo&s;e under &s;uch di&s;graceful
<PB N="34" REF="42">
terms; and that his pre&s;ence at court was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;upport. He deter|mined to return once more to Spain, con|vinced that a long ab&s;ence is mortal to one's intere&s;t at court, and that importunity and at|tendance often plead better than the mo&s;t &s;olid &s;ervices. However, before he departed, he exerted the little remains of authority he had left, to &s;ettle every thing in &s;uch a man|ner, as to prevent tho&s;e di&s;orders which hitherto he had always found the certain con&s;equence of his ab&s;ence. He built forts in all the mate|rial parts of the i&s;land, to retain the inhabi|tants in their &s;ubjection. He e&s;tabli&s;hed the civil government upon a better footing, and redoubled his diligence for the di&s;covery of mines, which were to be the great agents in his affairs; nor did he altogether fail of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It was the fate of this great man to have his virtue continually exerci&s;ed with troubles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. He continued his cour&s;e to Spain in the latitude of 22, not having at that time di&s;covered the advantageous method of running into the Northern latitudes to meet the South-we&s;t winds: they therefore made very little way; a &s;carcity en&s;ued, in which they were reduced to &s;ix ounces of provi&s;ion a day for each per&s;on. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the admiral fared no better than the common &s;ailor; yet in this di&s;tre&s;s his hunger did not get the better of the tenderne&s;s and humanity
<PB N="35" REF="43">
which di&s;tingui&s;hed his character. He re|fu&s;ed to li&s;ten to the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of his crew, who were very earne&s;t in this di&s;tre&s;s to have the Indian pri&s;oners thrown overboard to le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of provi&s;ions. In this voyage his &s;kill was as remarkable as his mag|nanimity. He had nine experienced pilots in his fleet; yet not one of them could tell where they were, after having been a full month from the &s;ight of the la&s;t land. This length of time per&s;uaded them they mu&s;t be very near Europe, and they were therefore for crowding &s;ail to make land as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. But Co|lumbus, upon &s;ure ob&s;ervations, maintained they were but a little to the We&s;tward of the Azores, and therefore ordered his &s;ails to be &s;lackened for fear of land. His prediction was fulfilled, and the Azores relieved them next morning. This, added to a &s;eries of predic|tions and noble di&s;coveries, made his &s;kill &s;eem &s;omething prophetic, and to exalt his charac|ter in this re&s;pect above all the &s;eamen before his time; and con&s;idering his opportunities of improvement, and what he did him&s;elf to im|prove his art, he will perhaps appear inferior to none who have been &s;ince.</P>
<P>All the accu&s;ations and prejudices again&s;t the admiral vani&s;hed almo&s;t as &s;oon as he ap|peared. He brought &s;uch te&s;timonies of his fidelity and good behaviour, as &s;ilenced all ca|lumnies which aro&s;e on that head; and the
<PB N="36" REF="44">
large &s;pecimens of gold and pearl he produced, refuted all that was &s;aid on the poverty of the Indies. The court was fully convinced of the importance of the new colony, the merit of its governor, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;peedy &s;upply. But the admiral's enemies were not idle, though they were &s;ilenced; they continued to throw all manner of ob&s;tructions in his way, which was not difficult in a country, where every thing is executed with much phlegm and languor, and where tho&s;e forms and mechanical methods of bu&s;ine&s;s, nece&s;&s;ary perhaps in the common cour&s;e of affairs, but ruinous in great de&s;igns, are more exactly ob|&s;erved, even than any where el&s;e. It was therefore with great difficulty that he was able to procure any relief to be &s;ent to Hi&s;paniola, but with much greater, and after a thou&s;and delays and di&s;appointments, that he was him|&s;elf enabled to &s;et out on a di&s;covery of more importance than any of the former.</P>
<P>He de&s;igned to &s;tand to the Southward from the Canaries, until he &s;hould come under the equinoctial line, and then to proceed di|rectly We&s;tward, until Hi&s;paniola &s;hould bear to the North-we&s;t from him, to try what opening that might afford to India, or what new i&s;lands or continent might reward his trouble. He therefore &s;tood away to the Cape de Verd i&s;land, and then South-we&s;t. In this navigation a thick fog, which intercepted
<PB N="37" REF="45">
the light of the &s;un and &s;tars, envelloped them for &s;everal days; and when this cleared off, the heats were grown &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the men could not venture between decks; the &s;un being at this time nearly vertical, the heavy rains which fall at this &s;ea&s;on between the tropicks, without abating the heat, added much to their di&s;tre&s;s. At la&s;t a &s;mart gale &s;prang up, and they went before it &s;eventeen days to the We&s;tward. The admiral, who could have no &s;econd to &s;upply his place, &s;carce allowed him&s;elf a moment's &s;leep; but in this, as in all his voyages, had the whole burthen of every thing upon him&s;elf; this threw him now into a fit of the gout; but nei|ther the fatigue nor the di&s;order could remove him from the deck, or make him abate of his u&s;ual vigilance. His provi&s;ions, however, being damaged by the heat, the wine ca&s;ks, many of them bur&s;t, and the wine being &s;oured in tho&s;e that held, obliged him to alter the cour&s;e he intended to keep Southward, and to decline &s;ome points to the North-we&s;t, happening to fall in with &s;ome of the Carib|bees, where he intended to refit and take in provi&s;ions, to enable him to continue his di&s;|coveries. But he had not &s;ailed long, when from the round-top a &s;eaman &s;aw land, which was an i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Guiana, now called Trinidad. Having pa&s;&s;ed this i&s;land and two others, which lie in the mouth of the great
<PB N="38" REF="46">
river Oronoquo, he was &s;urprized and endan|gered by a phaenomenon he had never &s;een before. The river Oronoquo, at all times very great, at this time augmented tenfold by the rains we have ju&s;t mentioned ru&s;hing into the ocean with an immen&s;e and rapid flood, meets the tides which ri&s;e here to a great height, and come in with much &s;trength; and both being pent up between the i&s;lands, and reverberated from one to another, cau&s;ed a conflict extremely terrifying to tho&s;e who have not been accu&s;tomed to it, and ignorant of the cau&s;e, as Columbus was at this time. But &s;ailing further he found plainly that he was in fre&s;h water, and judging rightly that it was probable no i&s;land could &s;upply &s;o va&s;t a river, he began to &s;u&s;pect he had di&s;covered the continent; but when he left the river, and found that the land continued on to the We&s;t|ward for a great way, he was convinced of it. Satisfied, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with this di&s;covery, he yielded to the unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his crew, and bore away for Hi&s;paniola, favoured by a fair wind and tho&s;e currents which &s;et &s;trongly to the We&s;tward all along the North|ern coa&s;t of South America.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this di&s;covery the admiral landed in &s;everal places, and traded with the inhabitants, among&s;t whom he found gold and pearl in tolerable plenty. Contrary to the cu&s;tom of many navigators, who behave
<PB N="39" REF="47">
wherever they go as if they never intended to come there again, he every where u&s;ed the natives with great civility, and gave them what they judged the full value of their com|modities; little bells, bits of gla&s;s and of tin, with &s;ome trifling apparel, being exchanged for gold-du&s;t and pearls, and much to the &s;atisfaction of both parties, who thought they had each over-reached the other, and indeed with equal rea&s;on.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>HE arrived at Hi&s;paniola the 19th of Augu&s;t, 1498, quite worn down with &s;ickne&s;s and continual watching, the nece&s;&s;ity of which was rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed as he came nearer home, among&s;t &s;uch a mul|titude of i&s;lands and &s;hoals as filled tho&s;e &s;eas, at this time little known; be&s;ides this a current, which &s;etting &s;trongly We&s;tward towards the continent, threatened every moment, without the greate&s;t attention, to carry him out of his cour&s;e. So wa&s;ted was he with the fatigue, that his brother, whom he had left in his place, &s;carce knew him at his return. But he found that he was likely to have as little repo&s;e upon land as at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The admiral's authority had &s;uffered &s;ome diminution, from the ill-judged &s;tep of &s;ending a check upon his motions before he left Hi&s;|paniola;
<PB N="40" REF="48">
and the encouragement this gave to all &s;orts of murmurings and complaints again&s;t government, laid the &s;eeds of a rebellion, which &s;prung up in the colony &s;oon after he left it. But this rebellion was more dangerou&s;ly formed than either of the former. For in the fir&s;t place, the rebels had regularly appointed them&s;elves a chief, called Francis Roldan; a man whom the admiral had left in a con&s;ide|rable po&s;t. This gave it an uniformity and credit. And &s;econdly, they gained the Indians to their party, by pretending to be their pa|trons, and a&s;&s;ertors of their liberty. Then to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves the more &s;ecurely, they made a &s;ece&s;&s;ion from the uncorrupted part of the colony, and &s;ettled in another part of the i&s;land, which formed an a&s;ylum for all idle and &s;editious per&s;ons, by whom they were reinforced daily.</P>
<P>In this threatening &s;tate of things, the admi|ral, having found his forces in no condition to act offen&s;ively again&s;t the rebels, did what he could to break their force, and di&s;&s;olve that union which made them formidable. He be|gan by publi&s;hing a free pardon for all that cho&s;e to conceal their crimes by a timely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Ob&s;erving be&s;ides, that many were very de|&s;irous of returning to Spain, he gave them to under&s;tand they might go with the &s;hips which brought the la&s;t &s;uccours. He did not intend to perform this latter part immediately,
<PB N="41" REF="49">
but he knew that his offers would &s;tagger &s;ome; and that in affairs of this nature, it is every thing to gain time. He wrote to court a full account of his late di&s;coveries, and &s;ent &s;am|ples of the wealth they yielded; and took the &s;ame opportunity of de&s;cribing the di&s;|tracted &s;tate of the colony, de&s;iring that 50 or 60 men might be &s;ent by every &s;hip, which he would replace by as many of the rebels, le&s;t the Spani&s;h power &s;hould be weakened in tho&s;e parts, by dimini&s;hing their men, or kept in as dangerous a &s;tate, by harbouring &s;uch as were ill di&s;po&s;ed to the publick good. He added very judiciou&s;ly to this reque&s;t that &s;ome religious men and able lawyers might be &s;ent him, as the mo&s;t effectual methods of introducing, and pre|&s;erving obedience and order. He then en|tered into negociations with the chiefs of the rebels; he granted them all they demanded, and even invidiou&s;ly placed their principal com|mander, Roldan, in &s;uch an office as flat|tered his pride, though without augment|ing his power. Thus things were brought into &s;omething of regularity, and without any &s;truggling or violence, and Roldan him&s;elf, though in his former office of chief judge of the i&s;land, contributed mo&s;t of all towards bringing tho&s;e who &s;tood out to obedience. There aro&s;e a difference between them; and on their fir&s;t motion, Roldan, by virtue
<PB N="42" REF="50">
of his authority, condemned and executed &s;e|veral. By this the re&s;t were awed, all connex|ion broke off, irretrievably, between the head and body of the rebels, and all done with|out having any part of the offence, that might be given by this &s;everity, charged to the admiral.</P>
<P>He now began ju&s;t to breathe in a little tranquility, acquired by the &s;evere&s;t labours, whil&s;t a new &s;torm was gathering again&s;t him from the court of Spain. His old im|placable enemies uniting with &s;ome of the rebels, who had lately tran&s;ported them|&s;elves into Spain, renewed the clamour a|gain&s;t him. They heaped upon him all manner of calumnies; they accu&s;ed him of a de&s;ign of &s;etting up for him&s;elf; and as they charged him in Hi&s;paniola with cruelty and tyranny to the Indians, here they rever&s;ed the charge, and accu&s;ed him of a popularity a|mong&s;t that people, dangerous to his and to their allegiance. They added to the&s;e, what could not fail to work on national prejudices, that he was a &s;tranger, and had not a proper re&s;pect for the Spani&s;h nobility. They complained that great debts were due to them; that all ways of recovering them were &s;hut up. In &s;hort, the king and queen never went abroad without being pur&s;ued and per&s;ecuted, by the clamours of the&s;e pre|tended &s;uitors of ju&s;tice. Wearied out with
<PB N="43" REF="51">
&s;uch complaints, they &s;ent a judge, with power to enquire into the admiral's conduct, and authorized, if he &s;hould find the ac|cu&s;ations proved, to &s;end him into Spain, and remain him&s;elf governor in his room. They made it the judge's intere&s;t to con|demn him.</P>
<P>This judge, who was extremely poor, and had no other call but his indigence to undertake the office, no &s;ooner landed in Hi&s;paniola, than he took up his lodging in the admiral's hou&s;e, for he was then ab&s;ent. He next proceeded to &s;eize upon all his effects; and at la&s;t &s;ummoned him and his brothers to appear. In the mean time, he encouraged all manner of accu&s;ations, without regarding the character of the accu&s;ers, or the probability or con&s;i&s;tency of their accu&s;ations. In con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e, he apprehended the admi|ral and his brothers, and with the la&s;t marks of in&s;ult and indignity, loaded them with irons, and embarked them to be tran&s;ported pri&s;oners into Spain.</P>
<P>The captain of the ve&s;&s;el, touched with re&s;pect for the years and great merit of Columbus, offered to take off the irons, but he did not permit it.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Since the king has commanded, that I &s;hould obey his go|vernor, he &s;hall find me as obedient to this, as I have been to all his other orders. No|thing but his commands &s;hall relea&s;e me.

If twelve years hard&s;hip and fatigue; if continual dangers and frequent famine; if the ocean, fir&s;t opened, and five times pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed, to add a new world abounding with wealth to the Spani&s;h monarchy; and if an infirm and premature old age, brought on by tho&s;e &s;ervices, de|&s;erve the&s;e chains as a reward; it is very fit I &s;hould wear them to Spain, and keep them by me as memorials to the end of my life."</Q></P>
<P>Great minds, though more apt to forgive injuries, perhaps, than common &s;ouls, do not ea&s;ily lo&s;e the memory of the wrongs that are done them. Columbus afterwards carried the&s;e irons with him wherever he went; they hung con&s;tantly in his chamber, and he ordered them to be buried with him.</P>
<P>The new governor that &s;ucceeded him, made a more effectual provi&s;ion for the re|ward of his &s;ervices; for be&s;ides confi&s;cating the greate&s;t part of the admiral's effects, which he converted to his own u&s;e, to flatter the people, he permitted an unbounded liberty&punc; by which he ruined the royal revenue, and was near ruining the colony too, pa&s;t all repa+ration, if the court had not recalled him in time, and &s;ent a per&s;on to &s;ucceed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> greater judgment and firmne&s;s, though of lit+tle more real virtue.</P>

<P>ABOUT this time the &s;pirit of di&s;cove|ry began to &s;pread it &s;elf largely, and private adventurers, both in Spain and Portugal, &s;timulated by the gold which from time to time was remitted to Europe by Columbus, made equipments at their own expences. In one of the&s;e the famous Americus Ve&s;putius com|manded; he had got into his hands the charts of Columbus, in his la&s;t voyage, and he &s;ailed the &s;ame cour&s;e. But as he was a man of addre&s;s and great confidence, and was be|&s;ides an able &s;eaman, and good geographer, he found a way of arrogating to him&s;elf the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the continent of America, and called it by his own name; which it has ever &s;ince retained, though nobody has any doubt concerning the real di&s;coverer. For this I believe no other rea&s;on can be given, than that America is perhaps a better &s;ounding word than Columbia, and is more ea&s;ily pro|nounced with the others, in enumerating the &s;everal divi&s;ions of the earth: a trifling matter, and influenced by trifling cau&s;es. But the glory of Columbus &s;tands upon foundations of another &s;ort.</P>
<P>Pinzon, one who attended the admiral in his fir&s;t voyage, equipped a &s;quadron at his own expence; and was the fir&s;t who cro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="46" REF="54">
the line at the &s;ide of America, and entered the great river Maranon, or the river of A|mazons.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the pope's exclu&s;ive grant, turned their thoughts to Ame|rica, and di&s;covered the Brazils, which make the mo&s;t valuable part of their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons, when they have lo&s;t what was con&s;ider|ed as their original right, and which never was &s;o advantageous to them.</P>
<P>What animated the&s;e adventurers, at the &s;ame time that it fixes a &s;tain upon all their characters and de&s;igns, is that in&s;atiable thir&s;t of gold, which ever appeared uppermo&s;t in all their actions. This di&s;po&s;ition had been a thou&s;and times extremely prejudicial to their affairs: it was particularly the cau&s;e of all the confu&s;ion and rebellions in Hi&s;paniola: yet it is certain, that if it were not for this incentive, which kindled the &s;pirit of di&s;covery and colo|nization fir&s;t in Spain and Portugal, and after|wards in all parts of Europe, America had ne|ver been in the &s;tate it now is; nor would tho&s;e nations ever have had the beneficial colo|nies, which are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of that country. It was nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be &s;omething of an immediate and uncom|mon gain, fitted to &s;trike the imaginations of men forcibly, to tempt them to &s;uch hazard|ous de&s;igns. A remote pro&s;pect of commerce, and the improvement of manufactures, by
<PB N="47" REF="55">
extending of colonies, would never have an|&s;wered the purpo&s;e; tho&s;e advantages come to be known only by rea&s;on and deduction, and are not con&s;equently of &s;o &s;triking a nature. But to go out with a few baubles, and to re|turn with a cargo of gold, is an object readi|ly comprehended by any body, and was con|&s;equently pur&s;ued with vigour by all. The &s;peculative knowledge of trade, made no part of the &s;tudy of the elevated or thinking part of mankind, at that time. Now it may be ju&s;tly reckoned among&s;t the liberal &s;ciences; and it makes one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branches of political knowledge. Commerce was then in the hands of a few, great in it's profits, but confined in it's nature. What we call the ballance of trade, was far from be|ing well under&s;tood; all the laws relative to commerce were every where but &s;o many clogs upon it. The impo&s;ts and duties charged on goods, were laid on without di&s;tinction or judgment. Even among&s;t our|&s;elves, the mo&s;t trading and rea&s;oning peo|ple in Europe, right notions of the&s;e matters began late, and advanced &s;lowly. Our colo|nies were &s;ettled without any view to tho&s;e great advantages which we draw from them.

<P>NO &s;ooner was Columbus arrived in Spain, in this di&s;graceful manner, than the court di&s;avowed, and highly blamed the beha|viour of their governor. And now, according to the giddy cu&s;tom of men, who act with|out plan or principle, they acquainted him of all the charges again&s;t him, with as little enqui|ry into their validity, as they before u&s;ed when upon the &s;ame charges they unju&s;tly condemned him. Re&s;titution and reward were promi&s;ed him, and he wanted very few incentives to engage once more in di&s;coveries His ambition was to arrive at the Ea&s;t-Indies and &s;o to &s;urround the globe. This had real|ly
<PB N="49" REF="57">
an influence upon his own mind, and he knew nothing could &s;o much influence tho&s;e of the king and queen. On this pro&s;pect he was again fitted out with a fleet, promi&s;ing to reduce both Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, under the dominion of their Catholic maje&s;ties.</P>
<P>He embarked upon his fourth voyage in May 1502. His de&s;ign was to &s;tand directly for the coa&s;t of South-America, and keep along the Northern &s;hore until he came to the place where he heard an ob&s;cure account of &s;ome narrow &s;treight, (whether a &s;treight or i&s;thmus was not &s;o clear from the accounts he had); and by this, if a &s;treight, he hoped to pa&s;s into the great South-Sea. After &s;o very long a voyage as his had been to America, and the di&s;covery of a continent which was not that of India, nor that of China; he &s;aw clearly that the maps were no longer in the lea&s;t to be re|lied on; he therefore depended &s;olely upon his own ideas. He reviewed the bearings of all the countries which his former experience, or his late di&s;coveries had opened to him; he con&s;idered the figure of the earth in general; he rea&s;oned upon the ballance and di&s;tribution of the land and water; and comparing all the&s;e he concluded, that beyond the continent he had di&s;covered was another ocean, probably as great or greater than that he had formerly pa&s;&s;ed; if this were &s;o, then it was probable too that the&s;e oceans had &s;ome communication. He judged it to be near tho&s;e places &s;ince called Veragua and Nombre de Dios; but not think|ing his &s;hips &s;o fit for that voyage, he propo&s;ed
<PB N="50" REF="58">
to put into Hi&s;paniola to change there, and make &s;ome new di&s;po&s;itions. Before he came into the harbour, he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to give the new governor Obando notice of his arrival, and the rea&s;ons which determined him to put in here. Columbus, whil&s;t he navigated and re&s;ided in the We&s;t-Indies, was extremely dili|gent in his ob&s;ervations upon the nature of the air, the &s;ea&s;ons, the meteors, rains and winds; and how each of the&s;e &s;eemed to affect the others; nor was he le&s;s &s;agacious in drawing progno&s;tics from the remarkable appearances in all of the&s;e; and now he judged from ob&s;ervations that a great hurricane was approaching, and this was an additional motive to him to de&s;ire to come into harbour. He heard too, that a con&s;iderable fleet was on the point of &s;etting &s;ail for Eu|rope, therefore he de&s;ired that the depar|ture of this fleet might be deferred for &s;ome days. But it was his de&s;tiny that ingratitude &s;hould pur&s;ue him every where, and per&s;ecute him in every &s;hape. For the governor, with|out any cau&s;e, not only refu&s;ed to hearken to his advice about the &s;ailing of the &s;hips, but ab&s;olutely denied him permi&s;&s;ion to enter into harbour, to &s;ave his life in that i&s;land which he him&s;elf had di&s;covered and &s;ubdued. He had no|thing to do but to draw up as clo&s;e to the &s;hore as he could. The &s;torm came on the next night, but providence favouring his innocence, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting his capacity, brought him &s;afe through it, though as terrible a &s;torm as had ever happened in tho&s;e &s;eas. The fleet of twenty &s;ail, which again&s;t his advice had put
<PB N="51" REF="59">
to &s;ea, &s;uffered the puni&s;hment due to their termerity. Only four e&s;caped the storm, &s;ix|teen peri&s;hed. Among&s;t tho&s;e which were lo&s;t, was the &s;hip which carried back that go|vernor to Spain, who had &s;ent Columbus thi|ther in &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive and &s;candalous a manner; among&s;t the four that were &s;aved, was one that had on board &s;ome trea&s;ure, all that could be re&s;cued from the pillage of the admiral's for|tune. So that whil&s;t he was mortified at this &s;hameful in&s;tance of human ingratitude, Hea|ven &s;eemed to declare in his favour, and to condemn and puni&s;h it. His character was highly rai&s;ed by the prediction of the &s;torm, and by his behaviour in it; for to his, and his brother's good conduct, the &s;afety of his little fleet was ju&s;tly attributed. His brother was a navigator and philo&s;opher, &s;econd only to the admiral, very u&s;eful to his affairs, and a com|fort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in all his misfortunes, by his capacity and the goodne&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>After he had weathered the &s;torm he left this i&s;land, in which he had &s;o &s;urprizing an in&s;tance of ingratitude, in pur&s;uit of more mat|ters to employ it. In this voyage he di&s;covered all the coa&s;t of Terra Firma to the i&s;thmus of Darien, where he hoped to have found a pa&s;|&s;age to the South-Sea. In this he was di&s;|appointed, but he was not di&s;appointed in the other part of his project; for every where as he advanced, he became more &s;en&s;ible of the value of his di&s;coveries on the continent. He
<PB N="52" REF="60">
found a people more civilized and more abounding in gold than the i&s;landers he had met with had been. He entered a harbour, which from it's excellence he called Porto Bello, well known &s;ince as one of the greate&s;t openings by which the Spani&s;h commerce is carried on between the two worlds. Here the admiral de&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ned to e&s;tabli&s;h a colony, under the command of his brother, propo&s;ing to re|turn to Europe him&s;elf to obtain the requi&s;ites for a compleat &s;ettlement. But the avarice and in&s;olence of his men rai&s;ed the country upon him, and obliged him to relinqui&s;h his de&s;ign, without having an opportunity of doing any thing more than &s;hewing his judgment in the choice of the &s;ituation, and his own and brother's bravery in extricating their men from the calamities in which their folly had in|volved them.</P>
<P>Driven from hence, and finding his ve&s;&s;els in &s;o bad a condition, that it was by no means advi&s;able to proceed upon further di&s;coveries, he quitted the continent, after having di&s;co|vered the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the i&s;thmus of Da|rien, and the whole more as far as Gracios o Dios in the gulph of Honduras. He then &s;tood over to Hi&s;paniola. His voyage was made under a thou&s;and difficulties of the &s;eve|re&s;t kind; their ve&s;&s;els &s;o leaky, that the crew had not a moment's re&s;pite from the pump, and &s;carce any provi&s;ion remaining to refre&s;h them after their labours. To compleat the &s;um of
<PB N="53" REF="61">
their calamities a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, in which the &s;hips fell foul of one another. But though he providentially weathered this &s;torm, it was now &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to keep his &s;hip above water, and he was glad to make Jamaica, where he was a &s;econd time relieved from the greate&s;t dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But a di&s;tre&s;s of almo&s;t as bad a nature exer|ci&s;ed his invention here. His &s;hips were ab|&s;olutely unfit for &s;ervice beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of being repaired; no means of getting new; the inhabitants &s;u&s;picious, and the ill beha|viour of his men gave daily occa&s;ion to in|crea&s;e tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he prevailed upon &s;ome of the hardie&s;t and mo&s;t faithful of them to pa&s;s over in a canoo to Hi&s;paniola, to repre&s;ent his calamitous &s;itua|tion to the governor, and to beg ve&s;&s;els to carry them off.</P>
<P>Eight months did the admiral remain in this i&s;land, without the lea&s;t intelligence from his me&s;&s;engers, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the governor. The natives grew exa&s;perated at the delay of the Spa|niards, and the weight of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them, which was a heavy burthen on the poverty of the In|dians. Provi&s;ions therefore came in very &s;paringly. Things even threatened to grow much wor&s;e; for the &s;eamen, who are at be&s;t unruly, but think that all di&s;cipline cea&s;es the moment they &s;et foot on land, mutinied in great numbers. By this mutiny the admiral's authority and &s;trength was con&s;iderably weakened, whil&s;t
<PB N="54" REF="62">
the natives were exa&s;perated by the di&s;orders of the mutineers; but he found means to re|cover his authority, at lea&s;t among the Indians. Knowing there would &s;hortly be a vi&s;ible eclip&s;e of the moon, he &s;ummoned the principal per&s;ons in the i&s;land; and by one who under&s;tood their language told them, that the God whom he &s;erved, and who created and pre&s;erves all things in heaven and earth, provoked at their refu&s;ing to &s;upport his &s;er|vants, intended a &s;peedy and &s;evere judgment upon them, of which they &s;hould &s;hortly &s;ee manife&s;t tokens in the heavens, for that the moon would, on the night he marked, appear of a bloody hue, an emblem of the de&s;truction that was preparing for them. His prediction, which was ridiculed for the time, when it came to be accompli&s;hed &s;truck the barbarians with great terror. They brought him plenty of provi&s;ions; they fell at his feet, and be&s;ought him in the mo&s;t &s;upplicating &s;tile to deprecate the evils which threatened them. He took their provi&s;ions, comforted them, and charged them to attone for their pa&s;t &s;in by their future gene|ro&s;ity.</P>
<P>He had a temporary relief by this &s;trata|gem, but he &s;aw no pro&s;pect of getting out of the i&s;land, and pur&s;uing tho&s;e great purpo&s;es to which he had devoted his life. The mutiny of his men was in danger of growing general, when every thing &s;eemed to be &s;ettled by the
<PB N="55" REF="63">
&s;ight of a &s;hip in the harbour, &s;ent by Obando, the governor of Hi&s;paniola. But as if it was calculated, not only to abandon, but to in&s;ult this great man in his misfortunes, the captain of the ve&s;&s;el was a mortal enemy to the admi|ral, and one of the per&s;ons principally con|cerned in tho&s;e rebellions, which had formerly given him &s;o much trouble. But his de&s;ign was only to be a witne&s;s of the di&s;tre&s;s of his affairs; for he came a&s;hore, forbidding his crew all manner of communication with the admiral or his men; and after delivering to Colum|bus an empty letter of compliment, embarked without even flattering him with the lea&s;t hope of relief.</P>
<P>Thus abandoned, his firmne&s;s and pre|&s;ence of mind alone did not for&s;ake him. The arrival of this &s;hip for a moment re|conciled his men to obedience; but when they &s;aw it depart, they were almo&s;t una|nimou&s;ly on the point of &s;haking off all authority, and abandoning them&s;elves to the mo&s;t de&s;perate cour&s;es. But the admiral, without betraying the lea&s;t &s;ign of di&s;appoint|ment or grief, told them in a chearful manner, that he had a promi&s;e of an immediate &s;upply; and that the rea&s;on of his not going off in this &s;hip was, that &s;he was too &s;mall to carry off all the Spaniards who were with him; and that he was re&s;olved not to depart until every man of them might enjoy the &s;ame convenien|cy.
<PB N="56" REF="64">
The ea&s;y and compo&s;ed air of the admi|ral him&s;elf, and the care he manife&s;ted for his people, &s;uperior to his own pre&s;ervation, re|conciled their minds, and made them attend their fate with patience. But he knew his de|lay might be very tedious in this i&s;land, and that as long as there remained a receptacle to which every ill humour among&s;t his men might gather, his affairs would grow wor&s;e every day; now that he found tho&s;e that ad|hered to him firmly attached to his cau&s;e, he came to a re&s;olution of taking vigorous mea|&s;ures with the re&s;t. He &s;ent his brother, a &s;en&s;ible and re&s;olute man, with a proper force, and well armed, to treat with them; and in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy to compel them to obedience. They met, and the captain of the mutineers, grown in&s;olent with a long cour&s;e of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s and rapine, not only rejected the propo|&s;al, but offered violence to the admiral's bro|ther, who u&s;ing this as a &s;ignal to his men, who were prepared, they fell upon the rebels with &s;uch re&s;olution, that ten lay dead in a moment with their chief; di&s;ordered by the unexpected attack, the re&s;t fled, and &s;oon after were obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Thus the admiral pacified every thing with equal &s;pirit and addre&s;s, &s;ometimes giving way to the &s;torm, and temporizing when he doubted his &s;trength; but when he was a&s;&s;ured of it, always employing it with re&s;olution and effect,
<PB N="57" REF="65">
turning every incident, even the mo&s;t unfa|vourable, to his advantage; and watching every change of nature, and every motion of the human mind, to employ them in his pur|po&s;es. It is the principal thing which forms the character of a great man, to be rich in ex|pedients; the u&s;e Columbus made of the eclip&s;e was truly ingenious. It may be &s;aid, that &s;uch a thing cannot be imitated among&s;t a civilized people. I grant it. But the way to imitate great men is not to tread in their &s;teps, but to walk in their manner. There is no people who have not &s;ome points of ignorance, weakness, or pre|judice, which a penetrating mind may not di&s;|cover, and u&s;e as the mo&s;t powerful in&s;tru|ments in the execution of his de&s;igns. Such a knowledge as this, is the only thing which gives one man a real &s;uperiority over another; and he who under&s;tands the pa&s;&s;ions of men, and can entirely command his own, has the principal means of &s;ubduing them in his own hands.</P>
<P>The admiral might have &s;pent his whole life in this mi&s;erable exile, if a private man, moved with e&s;teem for his merit, and com|pa&s;&s;ion to his misfortunes, had not fitted out a &s;hip for his relief. This brought him to Hi&s;|paniola. The governor, who refu&s;ed to con|tribute any thing to his coming, when he came received him with that overacted com|plai&s;ance and &s;hew of friend&s;hip, which &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="66">
often &s;ucceeds the greate&s;t in&s;olence in ba&s;e minds, and which they practi&s;e with &s;o little &s;hame and remor&s;e to the per&s;ons they have before loaded with the greate&s;t injuries. The admiral bore this like every thing el&s;e; and convinced that a di&s;pute with a governor in his own juri&s;diction would bring him little ad|vantage and honour, he ha&s;tened every thing for his departure to Spain, where he arrived after a voyage in which he was to&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t terrible &s;torms, and &s;ailed &s;even hundred leagues after he had lo&s;t his main-ma&s;t.</P>
<P>He was now grown old, and &s;everely af|flicted with the gout. The queen his patrone&s;s was dead; and the king, of a clo&s;e and di&s;&s;em|bling di&s;po&s;ition, and a narrow mind, was the only per&s;on he had to &s;ooth his misfortunes, or pay the reward which was due to his la|bours. But he received neither comfort nor reward; the performance of his contract was deferred upon frivolous pretences; and he em|ployed the clo&s;e of his life, as he had done the active part of it, in a court &s;ollicitation; the mo&s;t grievous of all employments to any man, the mo&s;t hopele&s;s to an old man. Vanqui&s;hed at la&s;t by years, fatigues, and di&s;appointments, he died with tho&s;e &s;entiments of piety, which &s;upported him through the misfortunes of his life, and added a fini&s;hing, which nothing el&s;e could give to his greatne&s;s of mind, and all his other virtues.</P>

<P>HEnceforward, in treating of the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h di&s;coveries and arms, in&s;tead of de&s;igns laid in &s;cience, and pur&s;ued with a benevolent heart and gentle mea&s;ures; we are but too often to &s;hew an enthu&s;ia&s;tic avarice, urging men forward to every act of cruelty and horror. The character of this fir&s;t di&s;coverer was extremely different from that of all with whom he dealt, and from that of mo&s;t of tho&s;e who pur&s;ued his di&s;coveries and conque&s;ts; &s;ome with a vigour and conduct equal, but all with virtues very much inferior. In his character hardly is any one of the com|ponents of a truly great man wanting. For to the ideas of the mo&s;t penetrating philo&s;opher, and a &s;cheme built upon them worthy of a great king, he joined a con&s;tancy and patience, which alone could carry it into execution, with the fortune of a private man. Continual &s;torms at &s;ea, continual rebellions of a turbu|lent people on &s;hore, vexations, di&s;appoint|ments, and cabals at court, were his lot all his life; and the&s;e were the only reward of &s;er|vices, which no favours could have rewarded &s;ufficiently. His magnanimity was proof again&s;t all of the&s;e, and his genius &s;urmounted all the difficulties they threw in his way, ex|cept that of his payment, the point in which
<PB N="60" REF="68">
&s;uch men ever meet with the wor&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and urge with the lea&s;t ability. That &s;urprizing art, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;o few, of making every acci|dent an in&s;trument in his de&s;igns; his nice adju&s;tment of his behaviour to his circum&s;tan|ces, temporizing, or acting vigorou&s;ly as the occa&s;ion required, and never letting the occa|&s;ion it&s;elf pa&s;s by him; the happy talent of concealing and governing his own pa&s;&s;ions, and managing tho&s;e of others; all the&s;e con&s;pire to give us the highe&s;t idea of his capacity. And as for his virtues, his di&s;intere&s;ted behaviour, his unmoveable fidelity to the ungrateful crown he &s;erved, the ju&s;t policy of his dealing with the In|dians, his caution to give them any offence, and his tender behaviour to them when conquered, which merited him the glorious title of their father, together with his zeal to have them in&s;tructed in the truths of religion, rai&s;e him to the elevated rank of tho&s;e few men whom we ought to con&s;ider as examples to mankind, and ornaments to human nature.</P>
<P>I hope it will be forgiven me, if I add a re|mark upon the conduct of the court of Spain with regard to this great man. Though, as we &s;aw all along, this conduct was equally unju&s;t and impolitick, &s;orry I am, that no le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction can be drawn from the event, which was in all re&s;pects as fortunate, as the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued were ungrateful and impru|dent. But there was a coincidence of events
<PB N="61" REF="69">
at that time, which does not always happen &s;o opportunely to ju&s;tify an ungrateful and narrow policy. It is certain that &s;ome men are &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with their de&s;igns, that when once engaged, nothing can di&s;courage them in the pur&s;uit. But great and frequent di&s;courage|ments are examples to others, which will at lea&s;t certainly have an effect, and will terrify men from forming &s;uch de&s;igns at all. Then the &s;pirit of invention and enterprize dies away; then things begin to &s;tagnate and to corrupt; for it is a rule as invariable in poli|ticks as it is in nature, that a want of proper motion does not breed re&s;t and &s;tability, but motion of another kind, a motion un&s;een and inte&s;tine, which does not pre&s;erve but de&s;troy. The be&s;t form and &s;ettlement of a &s;tate, and every regulation within it, obeys the &s;ame uni|ver&s;al law; and the only way to prevent all things from going to decay, is by continually aiming to better them in &s;ome re&s;pect or other; (&s;ince if they are not better, they will &s;urely be wor&s;e,) and to afford an attentive ear to every project for this purpo&s;e. I am &s;en&s;ible that it mu&s;t frequently happen, that many of the&s;e projects will be chimerical in them|&s;elves, and offered by a people of an appear|ance and manner not very prejudicing in their favour. But then I am &s;atisfied too, that the&s;e men mu&s;t in the nature of things have &s;ome|thing odd and &s;ingular in their character, who
<PB N="62" REF="70">
expo&s;e them&s;elves, and de&s;ert the common and certain roads of gain, in pur&s;uit of advan|tages not certain to the publick, and extreme|ly doubtful to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is equally true, that if &s;uch people are en|couraged, a number of vi&s;ionary &s;chemes will be offered. But it is the character of pride and lazine&s;s to reject all offers, becau&s;e &s;ome are idle, as it is of weakne&s;s and credulity to li&s;ten to all without di&s;tinction. But &s;urely, if judgment is to have any &s;hare in our con|duct, it is the province of judgment to &s;ift, to examine, to di&s;tingui&s;h the u&s;eful from the fooli&s;h, the fea&s;ible from the impracticable, and even in the mid&s;t of the vi&s;ions of a fruit|ful and di&s;ordered brain, to pick out matter which a wi&s;e man will know how to qualify and turn to u&s;e, though the inventor did not. Cromwell, partly from his circum&s;tances, but more from his genius and di&s;po&s;ition, received daily a number of propo&s;als of this kind, which always approached him in a fanatical dre&s;s, and were mixed frequently with matters the mo&s;t remote from probability and good &s;en&s;e; and we know that he made a &s;ignal u&s;e of many things of this kind.</P>
<P>Colbert &s;pent much of his time in hearing every &s;cheme for the extending of commerce, the improvement of manufactures, and the advancement of arts; &s;pared no pains or ex|pence to put them in execution, and bounti|fully
<PB N="63" REF="71">
rewarded and encouraged the authors of them. By the&s;e means France advanced during the reign of Lewis the fourteenth, and under this mini&s;ter more than it had done in many reigns before; and by the&s;e means, in the mid&s;t of wars, which brought that king|dom and all Europe to the brink of de&s;truc|tion; amid&s;t many defaults in the royal cha|racter, and many errors in his government, a &s;eed of indu&s;try and enterprize was &s;own, which on the fir&s;t re&s;pite of the publick cala|mities, and even whil&s;t they oppre&s;&s;ed that na|tion, ro&s;e to produce that flouri&s;hing internal and external commerce and power, that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes France, and forms it's &s;trength at this day, tho' a le&s;s active reign, and mini&s;ters of a different character have &s;ucceeded. On the contrary, it was always the character of the court of Spain to proceed very &s;lowly, if at all, in any improvement; and to receive &s;chemes for that purpo&s;e with coldne&s;s and di&s;dain. The effects upon the power of that monarchy were an&s;werable with regard to America, the conque&s;t as well as the di&s;covery was owing wholly to private men; the court contributed nothing but preten&s;ions and patents.</P>

<P>AN ancient painter drew a &s;atyrical pic|ture of Cimon the Athenian. He re|pre&s;ented this commander a&s;leep, and Fortune drawing a net over cities to put them into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. There never were princes to whom this repre&s;entation could be applied with more ju&s;tice, than to king Ferdinand and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or the emperor Charles. Without forming any plan in the cabinet, without i&s;&s;uing a penny out of their trea&s;ury, without &s;ending a regiment from their troops, private adventurers among&s;t their &s;ubjects put them into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a greater, and a more wealthy territory, than ever the mo&s;t celebrated con|querors had acquired by their valour, or their wi&s;dom. Nor was this conque&s;t more extra|ordinary for the trivial means by which it was accompli&s;hed, than for the &s;hortnefs of the time in which it was effected; for from the departure of Columbus, which was in the year 1492, to the entire reduction of Chili, which was in 1541, &s;even great kingdoms, inhabited by a va&s;t number of warlike and wealthy na|tions, were made to bow under the Spani&s;h yoke. For after the di&s;coveries of Columbus had enlarged the &s;phere of indu&s;try to active minds, &s;uch a &s;pirit of enterprize went abroad
<PB N="65" REF="73">
that not only tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e indigence might have driven them from their native country, but per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank went over to &s;ettle in America. Gold was the &s;pur to all tho&s;e adventurers of whatever rank; and this with a romantic &s;pirit of chivalry, made the greate&s;t hazards appear but common matters in their eyes. And indeed in a country wholly uncivilized, under the burning zone, and in many places extremely unhealthy, the tempe|rance of the Spaniards, their hardine&s;s under fatigue, and the patience and per&s;everance which make the mo&s;t &s;hining part of their character, enabled them to engage in en|terprizes, and to &s;urmount difficulties, to which any other people had certainly been unequal.</P>
<P>Va&s;co Nunez de Balboa was a man of a graceful pre&s;ence, a liberal education, an hardy con&s;titution, and had that kind of popular bravery, which recommends a man who en|gages in de&s;perate expeditions, where he mu&s;t have more authority from his per&s;on than his place. This man fir&s;t &s;urrounded Cuba, con|quered, and left it. He did not there find the trea&s;ures which he expected. He there|fore relinqui&s;hed the gleanings of this field to tho&s;e who had a more moderate ambition, and a more &s;aving indu&s;try. He &s;ought new ground, he followed the tracks of Columbus to Darien, gained the friend&s;hip of &s;ome of the Caziques,
<PB N="96" REF="74">
and conquered others. He was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered the South-Sea; and being as ready to di&s;cern the advantages of a country as to di&s;cover the country it&s;elf, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a colony upon that coa&s;t, and built the city of Panama. But according to the fate of all the fir&s;t adventurers in this new world, indeed according to the fate of mo&s;t who engage in new undertakings, he never lived to reap the fruit of his labours. He found him&s;elf &s;u&s;|pended by one who had only di&s;cernment enough of his merit to rai&s;e his jealou&s;y and envy, and who could make no other u&s;e of the di&s;coveries of this great man, than to increa&s;e his own private fortune. This man was a politician and a courtier, and having in &s;everal in&s;tances ba&s;ely injured Balboa, he was too wi&s;e to &s;top there, but under a pretended form of ju&s;tice cut off his head, and confi&s;cat|ed his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Some time after the &s;ettlement of Cuba, Don James Vela&s;quez obtained the govern|ment; a man of good &s;en&s;e in common affairs, but &s;o much mi&s;taken, as to imagine he could act a great part by deputy; and that too in cir|cum&s;tances, wherein a man who had but little capacity could do him but little &s;ervice, and he that could do much would certainly do it for him&s;elf. The continent of America was now very well known, and the fame of the great|ne&s;s and wealth of the Mexican empire &s;pread
<PB N="67" REF="75">
every where. This in&s;pired Vela&s;quez with a &s;cheme of reducing &s;ome part of this opulent country under his obedience. He pitched upon Hernando Cortes to command in this expedition, in which he certainly made a very right judgment. There was no man among&s;t the Spaniards, who to an adventurous di&s;po&s;i|tion then common to them all, knew &s;o well to join a cool and &s;teady conduct, to gain love whil&s;t he pre&s;erved re&s;pect; not to &s;hift his &s;chemes according to occa&s;ions, but per&s;i&s;ting uniformly in a well-judged de&s;ign, to make every inferior action and event &s;ub|&s;ervient to it; to urge &s;till forward; to extri|cate him&s;elf out of difficulties into which he was brought by bold actions, not by mean &s;ubterfuges, but by actions yet bolder. This was the character of the man already in high reputation, whom Vela&s;quez cho&s;e to conquer for him.</P>
<P>The embarkment was made at St. Jago de Cuba, and Cortes was to take in &s;ome rein|forcements at the Havanna. But he was hard|ly departed for this purpo&s;e, when Vela&s;quez grew jealous of him; and without con&s;idering that Cortes was of that heroic di&s;po&s;ition, in which a blind obedience is rarely a principal ingredient, he took the ill-judged &s;tep of re|moving him from the command of an army, which in &s;ome &s;ort might be con&s;idered as his own, &s;ince he had much influence on the
<PB N="68" REF="76">
&s;oldiers, and that a con&s;iderable part of the ex|pence of the armament had been &s;upplied by him&s;elf. When this order, which was to deprive him of his command, arrived to Cor|tes, he was not long before he came to a re&s;o|lution. He explained the whole matter to his &s;oldiers; he &s;hewed them how uncertain the intentions of Vela&s;quez were, and how much all their hopes were like to be fru&s;trated by the incon&s;tancy of his di&s;po&s;ition. The event was prepared. The &s;oldiers declared to a man, that they were &s;ubjects only to the king of Spain, and knew no commander but Cortes. The army and the general, thus bound to one another by their mutual di&s;obe|dience, &s;ailed for Mexico.</P>
<P>The empire of Mexico was at that time governed by a prince called Montezuma, the eleventh who reigned from the fir&s;t monarch who had conquered the country. The em|pire was elective, and the merit of Montezuma had procured him the election. A prince of capacity and courage, but artful, hypocritical, and cruel. This empire, founded on con|que&s;t, was increa&s;ed by his victories. By him&s;elf, or by his generals, he had ab&s;olutely &s;ubdued &s;everal kingdoms and provinces; &s;e|veral were made tributary, and others, which were not ab&s;olutely &s;ubdued, were influenced by his power to an entire obedience to his will. His armies were the be&s;t in that part
<PB N="69" REF="77">
of the world, and prodigiou&s;ly numerous. In this &s;ituation, and &s;o headed was the empire of the Mexicans, when Cortes came to prove it's &s;trength, with an army of no more than five hundred foot, and not quite &s;ixty hor&s;e. He did not come a &s;tranger into the country, to encounter a force which he dared to engage only because he was ignorant of it. He had long made every po&s;&s;ible enquiry from the Spaniards and Indians into every circum&s;tance of its internal weakne&s;s or power; it's allies, it's enemies, and the intere&s;ts which de|termined them to be allies or enemies. Weighing all the&s;e, and knowing, that along with great hopes, great dangers likewi&s;e lay before him, he made his retreat yet more dangerous by his di&s;obedience to the governor of Cuba; and when he landed on the conti|nent, he made it impo&s;&s;ible, for he burned his &s;hips. But though he had made a retreat impo&s;&s;ible, he had &s;omething el&s;e to encou|rage him to go forward, than the impo&s;&s;ibility of retiring. He had great hopes that many of the&s;e &s;tates, who were kept in a forced &s;ubjection, or a &s;lavi&s;h dread of Montezuma, would gladly turn this new and alarming ap|pearance from them&s;elves again&s;t him, and under the banner of the&s;e formidable &s;trangers, arm them&s;elves to &s;hake off the ancient tyran|ny, which always appears the wor&s;t, without fore&s;eeing con&s;equences, to which more civi|lized
<PB N="70" REF="78">
nations have frequently been as blind as they. It happened according to his expecta|tions.</P>
<P>The Zempoallans, a nation tributary to Montezuma, as &s;oon as they had &s;ufficient proofs of the power of the Spaniards, at the expence of &s;everal of their neighbours, who at|tempted to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s, threw off the Mexican yoke, gladly put them&s;elves under the protection of Cortes, and earned it by the large reinforcements which they added to his army. Montezuma was &s;oon made ac|quainted with the&s;e mea&s;ures. For according to the cu&s;tom of that well-regulated kingdom, he had po&s;ts &s;o &s;tationed, that in a little time he had notice of whatever happened in the remote parts of his empire. The di&s;patches which were &s;ent him, were painted cloaths, exactly repre&s;enting every circum&s;tance of the bu&s;ine&s;s of which he was to be informed; the figures were inter&s;per&s;ed with characters to explain what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be wanting in the picture. So far, but no farther, had this people advanced in the art of writing. As well informed as the emperor was of every particular of this inva&s;ion, and of the defection of his tributaries, he acted not at all con|formably to the greatne&s;s of his former exploits. He took the wor&s;t method which a great prince ever did upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, which was, to temporize. He let the Spaniards &s;ee,
<PB N="71" REF="79">
by &s;ome trifling arts which he u&s;ed to oppo&s;e them, that he did not look upon them as his friends, and at the &s;ame time neglected to act again&s;t them as &s;o formidable an enemy re|quired; by which means they made daily ad|vances in the country. His enemies were en|couraged, his tributaries made in&s;olent, and his &s;ubjects and allies utterly di&s;pirited; whil&s;t the Spaniards, in a variety of engagements, which they had with the petty princes of the country, rai&s;ed their reputation by a train of victories, and began to be con&s;idered as invincible. Cortes, like the great commander he was, took advantage of this irre&s;olute di&s;po|&s;ition in Montezuma, and u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible means to cheri&s;h it. He always &s;ent back what pri&s;oners of Montezuma's &s;ubjects his new allies had taken, with pre&s;ents, and every profe&s;&s;ion of e&s;teem and regard to their ma&s;ter, and with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving peace; reque&s;ting to &s;ee Montezuma, and to confer with him upon &s;ome matters he &s;aid he had in charge to de|clare to him from his ma&s;ter the emperor of the Romans.</P>
<P>There was at that time a celebrated republic on the coa&s;t of Mexico, towards the gulph, called Tla&s;cala. This people were &s;aid to be &s;o powerful, as to be able to arm four hundred thou&s;and men. Powerful as they were, tho' not &s;ubdued, they were yet awed by the
<PB N="72" REF="80">
greatne&s;s of the Mexicans. This awe, or perhaps a better policy, induced them to give a check to the Spaniards. But in the manner of Montezuma's proceedings they would not oppo&s;e them publicly, and therefore could not oppo&s;e them effectually. Some nations, on whom they had prevailed to fall upon the Spaniards, were over and over again defeated, together with tho&s;e troops the Tla&s;calans had &s;ent clande&s;tinely to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At la&s;t, by degrees, declaring them&s;elves more openly, as the danger pre&s;&s;ed them, they drew a large army into the field, which was routed by the troops of Cortes; few indeed in number, but infinitely &s;uperior in arms, and now grown fa|miliar with victory. The con&s;equence of this battle was the alliance of the Tla&s;calans with their conqueror, which they entered into with the le&s;s difficulty, as they were to &s;erve again&s;t the Mexicans, and might now hope to &s;erve with &s;ucce&s;s. Cortes, however, did not chu&s;e to tru&s;t this untried and forced alliance too far, nor at the &s;ame time to deprive him&s;elf entire|ly of the &s;uccour it produced. He therefore took a middle cour&s;e, and accepting three thou&s;and of their men, he held on his rout to Mexico.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE Cortes began his expedition to Mexico, he had built a &s;trong fortre&s;s at the principal port on the coa&s;t, to open a pa&s;&s;age for &s;uccours, when his &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould make intere&s;t enough to procure them. This he called La Vera Cruz, and it has &s;ince be|come a city, remarkable for the great traf|fick &s;ince carried on between the&s;e opulent countries and Old Spain. During the Tla&s;calan war, in which the Spaniards &s;uffered &s;ome|thing, and had every thing to apprehend, Montezuma took no &s;teps, but lay by watch|ing the event, in hopes that the Tla&s;calans might defeat the troops of Cortes at their own expence; or if the Spaniards proved victorious, he might then have the merit of not having u&s;ed ho&s;tilities again&s;t them. He lo&s;t both parties by this double conduct; &s;uch an in&s;idi|ous neutrality betrays nothing but the weak policy of him who u&s;es it. However, as a fair corre&s;pondence &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, he u&s;ed every means he could to di&s;|&s;uade Cortes from his propo&s;ed journey to Mexico. At la&s;t he took a &s;tep, wor&s;e judged than all the bad ones he had hitherto taken. He &s;ent to the Spaniards a very large and mag|nificent pre&s;ent, of every thing his dominions afforded valuable, but principally a va&s;t quan|tity
<PB N="74" REF="82">
of gold and precious &s;tones; offering at the &s;ame time yet more, and per&s;uading them to return to their own country. If any per&s;on in the army was unwilling before this to proceed, he now changed his mind. All were con|vinced that they ought to advance with &s;peed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the fountain of that wealth, of which this rich donation was but an in|con&s;iderable rivulet.</P>
<P>Montezuma, baffled in all his &s;chemes to keep the Spaniards at a di&s;tance, having u&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;hifting mea&s;ures, until they were in a degree grown habitual, found Cortes at the gates of Mexico before he was re&s;olved how he &s;hould receive him. He was now almo&s;t too late for force. He therefore di&s;|&s;embled his concern with the be&s;t grace he could, and received him with all the honours a monarch can be&s;tow, when he would di&s;play his own magnificence, and &s;hew his &s;en&s;e of extraordinary merit. Cortes was lodged in a palace &s;pacious and grand, after the manner of the country. All his Spaniards were lodged with him, but he took care to place a train of artillery at his gate.</P>
<P>Thus ported without a blow in the heart of this great city, the capital of the new world, he was for a while at a lo&s;s what mea&s;ures to pur&s;ue, for &s;ecuring him&s;elf in a conque&s;t of this importance. Having received more than he could rea&s;onably have a&s;ked, there was no
<PB N="75" REF="83">
cau&s;e of complaint, and con&s;equently no ad|vantage to be colourably taken. He had only to wait for &s;ome of tho&s;e critical incidents, upon who&s;e u&s;e all great matters depend, and without which the greate&s;t genius mu&s;t be at a &s;tand. It was not long before one of the&s;e occurred.</P>
<P>Two Tla&s;calans arrived in di&s;gui&s;e at Mexi|co, who brought him an account that a gene|ral of Montezuma had attacked &s;ome of his confederate Indians; that the garri&s;on of Vera Cruz had gone out to their defence; and that though the Mexicans were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s, the Spaniards were greatly endangered, many wounded, and one killed, who&s;e head, by the order of Montezuma, was carried through all the cities and villages of their country, to de|&s;troy the reverence in which they held the Spaniards, and undeceive them in a notion they had conceived, that the&s;e &s;trangers were immortal. This intelligence alarmed Cortes. He knew that opinion was one of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upporters of his little force; that things of this kind never &s;top at their beginnings; that Mon|tezuma, while he care&s;&s;ed him in his city, was disjoining his allies, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing his garri&s;on abroad; and that no time was to be lo&s;t in dilatory coun&s;els; and that he mu&s;t keep alive the memory of his former exploits. He therefore took a re&s;olution worthy of a brave man, in a difficulty made for his capacity. He
<PB N="76" REF="84">
armed him&s;elf in the be&s;t manner, and with five of the mo&s;t faithful and be&s;t re&s;olved of his officers, went directly to the palace of Monte|zuma. Thirty of his men attended at &s;ome di&s;tance. Guards of Spaniards were placed at the principal avenues to the palace.</P>
<P>It was u&s;ual for Montezuma's guards to withdraw, out of re&s;pect, when he had any conference with Cortes. On this occa&s;ion, as &s;oon as he was admitted to audience, he charged the emperor with the outrages com|mitted by his orders, in terms of great re&s;ent|ment. The emperor di&s;owns it. But Cortes, after having paid him the compliment of not &s;uppo&s;ing him capable of &s;o mean a di&s;&s;imula|tion, a&s;&s;ured him, that he was him&s;elf entirely &s;atisfied of his innocence, but that others had fears which were not &s;o ea&s;ily removed; but to &s;atisfy the Spaniards, he mu&s;t give &s;ome &s;olid proof of his confidence in them; which he could effectually do no otherwi&s;e than by his removing without delay to their quarters. A reque&s;t of this nature &s;tartled Montezuma, who never was u&s;ed to any voice but that of the humble&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. However, he &s;aw plainly that Cortes did not make &s;o extraordinary a reque&s;t, but with a re&s;olution of making it be com|plied with. He &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity, and he yielded to it.</P>
<P>Thus was the capital of a va&s;t and powerful empire, inhabited by an innumerable multi|tude
<PB N="77" REF="85">
of warlike people, entered without re&s;i&s;t|ance by an handful of men, who came to overturn it's liberty. And thus was one of the greate&s;t princes on earth, renowned for his wi&s;dom and valour, &s;eized in his palace, in the mid&s;t of this city, at noon-day, and carried pri&s;oner without noi&s;e or violence, by &s;ix per|&s;ons, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The people, confounded and enraged to find one whom they always u&s;ed to reverence as a god, treated in this unworthy manner, &s;ur|rounded the quarters of the Spaniards to puni&s;h this &s;acrilege, and re&s;cue their captive prince. But Cortes, who well under&s;tood the con&s;e|quence of the &s;teps he had taken, was not alarmed. He knew that he had now in his hands an engine, which was capable of doing any thing. Montezuma went out to appea&s;e the people, a&s;&s;ured them that he was there of choice, and (which was true) that the Spani|ards were wanting in no in&s;tance of re&s;pect due to his character and dignity.</P>
<P>This appea&s;ed and di&s;per&s;ed the people. But Montezuma, who&s;e unfortunate circum&s;tances obliged him to act as an in&s;trument to his own captivity, could enjoy no re&s;t, though allowed the attendance of the principal officers of his court, and indulged by the Spaniards in every thing but his liberty. Long revolving, he at la&s;t contrived a &s;cheme, which he judged, with|out his appearing to concur with them, might
<PB N="78" REF="86">
alarm his &s;ubjects with a &s;en&s;e of their danger, or oblige the Spaniards to depart by the rea|&s;onablene&s;s of his propo&s;als. He had always liberty of going abroad with a guard of Spa|niards, under pretence of doing him honour. He now de&s;ired to hold a council of the &s;tates of his empire, that in concurrence they might &s;atisfy Cortes and his a&s;&s;ociates in the ample&s;t manner. This council was convened, in which Montezema, in a premeditated &s;peech, &s;et forth the origin of his nation; the prophe|cies extant among them, that a people of the &s;ame race &s;hould arrive, to whom this em|pire &s;hould be &s;ubject; that the people were now arrived who were the object of tho&s;e pro|phecies, and &s;prung from this origin, to whom the gods had de&s;tined univer&s;al empire, and who, by their great accompli&s;hments and &s;ur|prizing bravery, merited their high de&s;tination: then he &s;olemnly declared him&s;elf tributary to the emperor of the Romans; he exhorted them on their part to a due obedience; and ended by telling them, that as he had him&s;elf prepared a pre&s;ent from his trea&s;ures worthy of this great emperor, he expected that every one of them, in proportion to his ability, would te&s;tify his loyalty to this new ma&s;ter, and his regard to the merit of his general, and tho&s;e brave men that attended him, that they might be enabled to depart &s;peedily to their own country, with that opinion of their brethren the Mexicans,
<PB N="79" REF="87">
which their affection to them, and their obe|dience to their common ma&s;ter, de&s;erved.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t an entire &s;ilence &s;ucceeded this ha|rangue; the whole a&s;&s;embly confounded and &s;truck dumb with grief, indignation, and &s;ur|prize. Then followed a mixed cry, as each per&s;on was affected by &s;ome particular part of the general calamity. The lu&s;tre of their em|pire tarni&s;hed, their religion to be profaned, their freedom &s;urrendered, their emperor de|graded, what was wor&s;e, degraded by him&s;elf; could they believe their ears? Was it Montezu|ma who had &s;poken in &s;uch a manner? The de&s;ign of Montezuma was until this moment a &s;ecret to Cortes; he was &s;urpri&s;ed, and &s;ome|thing chagrined at an artifice, the invention of which he now penetrated very clearly. But his &s;urpri&s;e did not confound or perplex him in the part he &s;aw it was proper for him to act. Without any embarra&s;&s;ment, he &s;econded the harangue of Montezuma by a &s;peech, which was well interpreted, wherein he &s;trongly urged the propriety, and in&s;inuated the nece&s;|&s;ity of an entire obedience to their prince, and an imitation of his conduct. Di&s;ordered as the a&s;&s;embly was, yet &s;till held by a &s;acred reverence to their emperor, influenced by the hope of the &s;udden departure of the Spaniards, and re&s;erving them&s;elves for a better occa&s;ion, they followed Montezuma's example, and paid homage to Cortes, in that dumb and
<PB N="80" REF="88">
&s;ullen &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with which fierce &s;pirits yield to nece&s;&s;ity. He received it, and thanked them, as a man thanks his debtor for a ready payment.</P>
<P>Cortes &s;aw that this empty homage &s;ecured him nothing; but he knew that the gold, which was to accompany it, would be of real &s;ervice in cancelling the ill impre&s;&s;ions made by his di&s;obedience in Spain. In Mexico he might look upon him&s;elf as &s;ecure; he had the per&s;on of the emperor in his hands; he had his forces in the capital; and he had lately &s;truck a terror into all, by &s;eizing the general, who had committed ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Spaniards. He got the emperor to di&s;avow his conduct, and condemn him as a traitor. By their joint authority, this unhappy man, guilty of nothing but obedience to his lawful ma&s;ter, and zeal for his country, was burned alive in the pub|lick &s;quare of Mexico. But neither this horrid example, nor the impri&s;onment of their emperor, nor the late acknowledgment of the emperor Charles, was &s;ufficient to make the Mexicans in&s;en&s;ible to the di&s;grace they &s;uffered, nor of the danger which hung over them. They began to con&s;ult how they might deliver them&s;elves. Some propo&s;ed to cut off the communication with the continent, and hold the Spaniards be&s;ieged in their quar|ters; for the city of Mexico is an i&s;land in a great lake, and communicates with the conti|nent
<PB N="81" REF="89">
by four great cau&s;eways, extremely cu|rious for contrivance and &s;olidity. Whil&s;t they were ripening their &s;chemes, a report came to Cortes, that &s;ome words had dropt from a Mexican concerning the practicability of de&s;troying one of the&s;e cau&s;eways. From this word, (for he heard no more) this watch|ful and &s;agacious commander judged of the whole contrivance? Without however taking notice of it publicly, he immediately orders two brigantines to be built to &s;ecure his re|treat, if a retreat &s;hould prove the wi&s;e&s;t mea|&s;ure. In the mean time he kept a &s;trict di&s;ci|pline in his army; and to pre&s;erve reverence from the Indians, he prohibited their approach|ing his quarters when his men were a&s;leep, and &s;everely puni&s;hed tho&s;e of his &s;oldiers who &s;lept out of the times and places appointed for that purpo&s;e. All this while no preparations for his departure.</P>

<P>MONTEZUMA, &s;ick with impatience of his confinement, and &s;eeing that he daily lo&s;t his authority among&s;t the people by the pu&s;illanimous appearance of his conduct, as &s;oon as he perceived that any &s;pirited action on his &s;ide would be &s;econded with equal &s;pirit by his &s;ubjects, he rou&s;ed his dormant magnanimity, and in &s;pite of the condition he

was in, he &s;ent for Cortes, and addre&s;&s;ed him in this manner: <Q REND="inline">"Cortes, the de&s;ires of my &s;ubjects, my own dignity, and the commands of my gods, require that you &s;hould depart my empire. You are &s;en&s;ible how much I have valued your friend&s;hip, and how effec|tually I have &s;hewn that I valued it. But after &s;o many profe&s;&s;ions of good-will upon your &s;ide, and &s;o many proofs of it upon mine, after every pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s is over, wherefore do you delay your return? I have yielded homage to your ma&s;ter, I am ready to obey him, I have &s;ent him pre&s;ents, (or &s;hall I call it a tribute) worthy of my&s;elf and of him; your whole army is loaded, even to an inconvenience, with their darling gold. Would they have more? Shall more be delivered them? But then, when they &s;hall have &s;poken their large&s;t wi&s;hes, and &s;atisfied their mo&s;t eager de&s;ires, I in&s;i&s;t upon it that they depart immediately, or they may find, in &s;pite of the condition I am in, of which condition, for your &s;ake, and for my own, I &s;hall &s;peak but little, that Montezuma has yet courage enough to vindicate his own honour, and friends in Mexico who will not fail to revenge the wrongs he &s;hall &s;uffer."</Q></P>
<P>Cortes perceived &s;omething of an unu&s;ual re&s;olution and &s;ternne&s;s in the emperor's coun|tenance whil&s;t he &s;poke. He therefore &s;ent orders, before the interpreter began to explain
<PB N="83" REF="91">
his &s;peech, that the Spaniards &s;hould &s;tand to their arms, and wait his commands. His an|&s;wer was re&s;olute, but not &s;uch as to drive the emperor to de&s;pair. He lamented the jealou&s;y which their common enemies had occa|&s;ioned; that for his part he was &s;ecured from all fear by his own courage, and the bravery of his troops; but &s;ince he was &s;o unfortunate as to find he could not longer enjoy the honour of a conver&s;ation he had &s;uch rea&s;on to e&s;teem, con&s;i&s;tently with the emperor's repo&s;e, he would depart as &s;oon as &s;hips could be built, for on landing he had been obliged to burn his own. This an&s;wer &s;oothed Montezuma; he re&s;umed his good humour, he promi&s;ed to load his army with gold at his departure, and gave immediate orders that every thing &s;hould be prepared for fitting out the &s;hips in the &s;peedie&s;t and ample&s;t manner. But Cortes gave orders, which were full as well obeyed, to the per&s;on he appointed for the equipment, to delay it upon every po&s;&s;ible pretence. He expected daily the return of the me&s;&s;engers he had &s;ent into Spain, to &s;ollicit his pardon and &s;uccours, with the continuance of the com|mand.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was entertained with the&s;e ex|pectations, and with finding out pretences to defer his departure, an expre&s;s arrived from Sandoval, his governor at La Vera Cruz, in|forming him of the arrival of eighteen &s;hips, in
<PB N="84" REF="92">
which was an army of eight hundred foot, and two hundred hor&s;e, under the command of one Narvaez, who was &s;ent by his old ene|my Vela&s;quez, the governor of Cuba, to &s;u|per&s;ede him in the command, to treat him as a rebel, and &s;end him in chains to Cuba. The governor &s;eized the me&s;&s;engers, who were &s;ent by Narvaez, to require him to &s;urrender, and &s;ent them pri&s;oners with this account to Cortes. There never was a time wherein the firmne&s;s and capacity of this commander were put &s;o &s;trongly to the proof. On one hand, here was an army in weapons and courage equal to his own, in numbers va&s;tly &s;uperior, and above all, &s;trengthened with the name of the royal authority. The Mexicans, ill-affect|ed before, would rejoice in this opportunity to fall upon him. On the other hand, mu&s;t he re&s;ign the conque&s;ts he had made with &s;uch infinite toils and hazards, into the hands of his mortal enemy, and in return to bear the name, and receive the puni&s;hment of a tray|tor? There was little room to hope for an accommodation. The thoughts of a &s;urrender were intolerable. One way only remained, to conquer Narvaez. His own courage and con|duct; his &s;oldiers, habituated to victory, and endeared to him by common dangers and triumphs; his reputation, and the &s;ignal pro|vidence which always attended him, would combat upon his &s;ide. Above all, no time

was to be lo&s;t in fruitle&s;s coun&s;els. He &s;ent an expre&s;s to Sandoval, his governor in La Vera Cruz, to evacuate that place, and join him in his rout with what men he had. He a&s;&s;embled his forces, and found them to a man attached to his intere&s;ts, and ready to ha|zard every thing in &s;upport of them. He left eighty men in Mexico, picked from his troops, recommending them to Montezuma, and him to them. With this &s;mall garri&s;on he dared to entru&s;t Mexico and all his va&s;t hopes there; but the impri&s;oned emperor was him&s;elf a garri&s;on, from the reverence his &s;ubjects bore him. Before he &s;et out, he relea&s;ed the pri|&s;oners which Sandoval had &s;ent him, u&s;ing the &s;everity of his officer to di&s;play his own cle|mency. He care&s;&s;ed them extremely, loaded them with pre&s;ents for them&s;elves, and the principal officers of Narvaez's army, and did every thing to create him&s;elf a party there by his genero&s;ity. He &s;ent at the &s;ame time very advantageous terms of accommodation to the general him&s;elf, but took care to follow and &s;econd his amba&s;&s;adors with all the power he could rai&s;e. This, with Sandoval's rein|forcement, did not amount to three hundred men; but with the&s;e, and &s;ome confederate Indians, he marched with all imaginable dili|gence to Narvaez's quarters.</P>
<P>Narvaez, elated with the &s;uperiory of his army, would hearken to no terms, though he

was much pre&s;&s;ed to it by his principal officers, who di&s;covered plainly that this quarrel could only end in the ruin of their party, or that of the Spani&s;h intere&s;t in Mexico. Mean time Cortes, little incumbered with baggage, and le&s;s with a dilatory genius, advanced by forced marches. He was but a &s;mall di&s;tance from the enemy's quarters, when the rains came on, and as u&s;ual in that country, fell very heavily. Cortes knowing that the ill di&s;po&s;itions of the &s;ky were circum&s;tances favourable to a &s;ur|prize, inviting to de&s;perate enterprizes, and that they are always lea&s;t prejudicial to tho&s;e in motion, having perfect intelligence of the di&s;po&s;ition of Narvaez's army, and having di&s;|po&s;ed his troops in &s;uch a manner as not to fall upon one another, and to act in concert, he ordered them, when they &s;hould enter the town where the enemy was po&s;ted, to keep in clo&s;e to the hou&s;es, that they might not &s;uf|fer by the artillery, which was &s;o placed as to play upon the middle of the &s;treet. Having made this di&s;po&s;ition, he marched to attack the camp, on one of tho&s;e gloomy and tempe|&s;tuous nights. Though he directed every thing with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy, Narvaez had intelligence of his approach, but he laughed at it; and not under&s;tanding the nature of a prudent ra&s;hne&s;s, could not believe that Cortes would make &s;uch an attempt in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, went to &s;leep, without taking &s;ufficient care that
<PB N="87" REF="97">
it &s;hould not be di&s;turbed. Security in the ge|neral is ea&s;ily followed by that of every one el&s;e. Cortes a&s;&s;aulted the town in three bodies, and whil&s;t every one in the adver&s;e party ran in confu&s;ion to his arms, and op|po&s;ed without command or uniformity, as each man was attacked, the whole army was routed. The quarters of Narvaez were at|tacked by Cortes's divi&s;ion, and the men routed there as el&s;ewhere. Narvaez him&s;elf, &s;hame|fully taken in bed, fell into his hands. <Q REND="inline">"Value your&s;elf, &s;aid he, my lord Cortes, on your for|tune in making me your pri&s;oner!"</Q> But Cortes, with a &s;mile of indignation, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"That he thought this by far the lea&s;t action he had performed, &s;ince he came into the new world."</Q></P>
<P>When the morning came on, the di&s;per&s;ed army of Narvaez began to form into bodies, and to di&s;cover the incon&s;iderable force which the night before had defeated them. Their fir&s;t motion, di&s;tracted with &s;hame and anger, was to fall upon the conquerors, and recover the honour they had lo&s;t. But when they found that their general was a pri&s;oner, their artillery &s;eized, and the advantageous po&s;t they had occupied in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and numbers among&s;t them&s;elves well-affected to Cortes, they li&s;tened at la&s;t to his propo&s;als, recommended as they were by the polite and in&s;inuating behaviour of which he was ma&s;ter,
<PB N="88" REF="98">
and that open and unbounded genero&s;ity he &s;hewed to every one. They all enli&s;ted un|der his banner, and agreed to &s;hare his fortune. Thus did this accident, which &s;eemed to threaten inevitable de&s;truction to the affairs of Cortes, prove the mo&s;t effectual method of re&s;toring them to an excellent condition, wholly by means of the wi&s;dom of his mea|&s;ures, and of that vigour and activity with which he pur&s;ued them. His army now con|&s;i&s;ted of above a thou&s;and men after replacing his garri&s;on at La Vera Cruz, in which fortre&s;s he left Narvaez a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>This victory, and the reinforcement it pro|cured, came at a mo&s;t critical time; for hardly had he begun to adju&s;t matters for his return to Mexico, when an expre&s;s arrived that his affairs there were in a mo&s;t dangerous condi|tion. Alvarado, whom he had left to com|mand at his departure, though a brave and able man, had too great a contempt for the Indians, and too little di&s;cernment for the nice circum&s;tances he was in, to manage with that ju&s;t mixture of firmne&s;s and yielding, by which Cortes had hitherto &s;o ballanced the hopes and fears of the Mexicans, that he never gave them an entire opportunity of knowing their own &s;trength. This man, ei|ther di&s;covering, or pretending at lea&s;t to dis|cover, that &s;ome of the chief men in the city, who were met in the great temple, were a&s;|&s;embled
<PB N="89" REF="99">
to con&s;ult how to expel the Spaniards, &s;uddenly &s;urrounded the place, and murdered all the per&s;ons of rank who were met in the temple. This cruel and precipitate action at once raifed the whole people. Enraged at what they had already &s;uffered, and what they &s;aw plainly they were yet to expect from the tyranny of the&s;e intruders, their own ig|nominous patience, the fear of the Spani&s;h arms, their inbred re&s;pect for Montezuma, were all lo&s;t in their fury. Should they &s;tay, until on various pretences they were all butchered? Montezuma, either forgetful of his office and dignity, or unable to exert it, could protect them no longer. Gods and men allowed them to defend them&s;elves, and arms were in their hands. The flame, &s;o fu|rious in the capital, &s;pread it&s;elf with equal &s;wiftne&s;s and rage over all the country, and all were vowed and hearty for the de&s;truction of the Spaniards. In this extremity Alvarado &s;hewed as much bravery as he had done im|prudence in bringing it on. He redoubled his watch on the emperor; he obliged him to exert the remains of his authority in his favour, and fortifying his quarters in the be&s;t manner the time would admit, he &s;tood out the &s;torm, and repul&s;ed the Mexicans in &s;everal attacks; but their fury, far from relenting at the fre|quent and bloody repul&s;es they met, redoub|led by their lo&s;&s;es. They exerci&s;ed the be|&s;ieged
<PB N="90" REF="100">
day and night, with the mo&s;t vigorous a&s;&s;aults at the beginning to cut off their re|treat, and burned the brigantines which Cortes had built.</P>
<P>Cortes, who was obliged to make &s;o rapid a march from Mexico, to defend him&s;elf a|gain&s;t Narvaez, was compelled by an equal nece&s;&s;ity to march from Zempoallo to Mexico, to relieve his forces, and pre&s;erve his mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential intere&s;ts there. The Mexicans, like all people who have not reduced the art of war to &s;ome rule, &s;uffered their eagerne&s;s in pur&s;uing one advantage, to let other material ones lie neglected For whil&s;t they pu&s;hed on the &s;iege of the Spani&s;h quarters with great vigour and diligence, they took no effectual care of the avenues to the city, or to cut off all &s;uccours from the be&s;ieged. Cortes entered the city without re&s;i&s;tance. He &s;oon routed tho&s;e who inve&s;ted the po&s;t of the Spaniards, and brought them a relief, of which they &s;tood in the greate&s;t need. This arrival of &s;o formidable a body of troops, held the Mexi|cans &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence; but in &s;pite of the fatal error of admitting them into their city, which had now inexcu&s;ably been a &s;econd time committed, and in &s;pite of the &s;ucce&s;s every where attending the Spani&s;h arms, they came to a re&s;olution of continuing ho&s;tilities. But things wore another face &s;ince the arrival of Cortes. No longer &s;atisfied with defend|ing
<PB N="91" REF="101">
his quarters, he &s;allied out and defeated them &s;everal times with great &s;laughter. However, as he found that he &s;uffered more by the lea&s;t lo&s;&s;es than the Mexicans by the greate&s;t, he kept clo&s;e for &s;ome time, &s;uffering the enemy to approach, in hopes of making one la&s;t effort, to appea&s;e them by the autho|rity of Montezuma. This unhappy prince, reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of becoming the in&s;trument of his own di&s;grace, and of the &s;lavery of his people, appeared on the battle|ments, and addre&s;&s;ed his &s;ubjects with every argument he could u&s;e to prevail with them to di&s;per&s;e. But this expedient was not attended with the u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. The Mexi|cans, by an habit of living without rule, had many of them lo&s;t much of that re&s;pect, which, even to adoration, every one of them u&s;ed to pay their prince; they an&s;wered him with re|proaches, and a &s;tone from an uncertain hand &s;truck Montezuma with great violence in the temple. The Spaniards carried him to his apartment. Here he refu&s;ed to &s;uffer any dre&s;&s;ings to be applied to his wound, but wrapping his head in his garment, gave him|&s;elf up a prey to &s;hame and grief, and in a few days died, le&s;s of his wound, which was but incon&s;iderable, than of &s;orrow and indignation, on feeling that he had &s;o far lo&s;t the e&s;teem and love of his &s;ubjects. There are other ac|counts
<PB N="92" REF="102">
of the death of Montezuma, but this appears the mo&s;t probable</P>
<P>Thus died this great prince, more remark|able for the great virtues by which he a&s;cend|ed the throne, and tho&s;e qualities by which he held it in &s;o much lu&s;tre for many years, than for his &s;teadine&s;s and wi&s;dom in defending it when attacked by a formidable enemy. It has happened thus to many great men. When Lucullus and Pompey attacked Tigranes, king of Armenia, we do not &s;ee any thing in him of the conqueror of &s;o many kings. Even his conqueror Pompey was not him&s;elf, after hav|ing enjoyed in glory for a long time a power acquired by the greate&s;t exploits. <HI>Se e&s;&s;e mag|num oblitus e&s;t.</HI> It is natural, whil&s;t we are rai&s;ing our&s;elves, and contending again&s;t diffi|culties, to have our minds, as it were, &s;trung, and our faculties intent and con&s;tantly awake. The nece&s;&s;ity of our affairs obliges us to a con|tinual exerci&s;e of whatever talents we po&s;&s;e&s;s; and we have hope to animate and urge us on|ward. But when we are come to the &s;ummit of our de&s;ires, the mind &s;uffers it&s;elf to relax. It is grievous to contend a-new for things, of which we have long looked upon our|&s;elves as &s;ecure. When we have no longer any thing to hope, we have then every thing to fear. Thus enervated by this pro&s;perity, and di&s;compo&s;ed with this fear, we become
<PB N="93" REF="103">
&s;tiff and irre&s;olute to action; we are willing to u&s;e any temporizing mea&s;ures, rather than ha|zard on any adventure &s;o much power and re|putation. If Montezuma had made an early u&s;e of his &s;trength, he had &s;trength enough, after many lo&s;&s;es, to have kept Cortes far enough from his capital; but having once entered upon &s;hifting and dilatory cour&s;es, this brave and active enemy gave his affairs a mortal blow, by &s;eizing upon his capital, and by this means &s;ome time after by &s;eizing upon his per&s;on too. The re&s;t was all a con&s;equence which no prudence could prevent, of a plan of conduct imprudent and ill laid originally.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the Mexicans were apprized of the death of their emperor, they &s;et about the election of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. They im|mediately ca&s;t their eyes upon Guatimozin, nephew and &s;on-in-law of Montezuma, a man fit to command at &s;uch a time; of a per|&s;on graceful, a body &s;trong and robu&s;t, and of a &s;oul full of the mo&s;t undaunted courage. Though no more than twenty-four years old, the reputation of his early exploits procured him the authority of age, and a penetrating genius &s;erved him for experience. He was no &s;ooner called to this un&s;teady throne, than he took mea&s;ures to prevent the Mexicans from their
<PB N="94" REF="104">
di&s;orderly and ca&s;ual attacks, and to make them act with de&s;ign and uniformity. He examined thoroughly into the cau&s;e of their former mi&s;carriages; and con&s;idering every thing, he found that the Indians in their pre|&s;ent condition, could never hope for any &s;uc|ce&s;s in open fight; he re&s;olved therefore to &s;pare his men as much as po&s;&s;ible, until his own invention and time might teach them better methods of fighting. On the&s;e ideas he cau&s;ed all a&s;&s;aults to cea&s;e; then he cut off the cau&s;eways which joined the city to the conti|nent, and at the &s;ame time &s;trongly barricaded the &s;treets, re&s;olving to &s;tarve an enemy which &s;eemed unconquerable by any other means; a mea&s;ure, which though it has with us no ex|traordinary appearance, &s;hewed no &s;mall &s;aga|city in Guatimozin, becau&s;e it was what had never been before practi&s;ed among&s;t the mili|tary &s;tratagems of this people, and invention is the characteri&s;tic of genius.</P>
<P>From henceforward the whole method of the war was changed, the Spaniards grew every day more and more &s;treightened for pro|vi&s;ions, and whenever they &s;allied out, though they &s;lew great numbers of their opponents, the many canals of the city, and barricado be|hind barricado, after &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful progre&s;s, obliged them, vanqui&s;hed by mere wearine&s;s, to return without effect to their quarters. The Spaniards, invincible by the Indian arms, were
<PB N="95" REF="105">
not proof again&s;t famine. Cortes &s;aw that nothing was left for his &s;ecurity, but as &s;peedy a retreat as po&s;&s;ible; and though this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lo&s;e them the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the trea&s;ure they had ama&s;&s;ed, it was what lea&s;t afflicted him. He encouraged his troops, by chearfully relinqui&s;hing his own part, not to attempt burthening them&s;elves with a trea&s;ure which they might con&s;ider as lying at an advantageous intere&s;t, until they &s;hould, as they certainly would, be enabled to return with a &s;ufficient force to reclaim it. The re&s;olution of retreating being now taken, and all things di&s;po&s;ed for it, a que&s;tion aro&s;e, whether it were better made by day or in the night. On this the council of war was divided; and their rea&s;ons &s;eeming pretty equal, a per&s;on among&s;t them, a &s;ort of a&s;trologer, who pa&s;&s;ed for a prophet, and as &s;uch was much re|&s;pected by the greater part of the army, promi&s;ed them certain &s;ucce&s;s if they retreated by night. Certain it is, that when mea&s;ures are dubious, &s;uper&s;titious determinations have great u&s;e; for as rea&s;on cannot ea&s;ily determine the right way, that method which &s;uper&s;tition fixes upon, is by the weight it has from thence, pur&s;ued with the greater chearfulne&s;s and effect.</P>
<P>The general was guided by the prophet, and he di&s;po&s;ed every thing for his retreat with great judgment. He cau&s;ed the u&s;ual fires to be lighted in every part of his quarters. Some
<PB N="96" REF="106">
of his bolde&s;t and mo&s;t active men led the van. The pri&s;oners, artillery, and heavy baggage were in the center. He him&s;elf, with one hundred of his choice&s;t troops, formed the rear. With wonderful order and &s;ilence, and without any interruption, did the Spaniards march until they came to the fir&s;t breach in the cau&s;eway. Here a portable wooden-bridge which Cortes had prepared, was laid over; but when the artillery and hor&s;es had pa&s;&s;ed, it was wedged &s;o clo&s;ely into the &s;tones that bordered the cau&s;eway, that it could not be removed, and there was yet another breach. But they were &s;oon called from attending to this by a more pre&s;&s;ing danger; for as nothing could elude the vigilance of the new emperor, he found out their intention of retreating, and di&s;po&s;ed all along the &s;ides of the cau&s;eway an infinite multitude of canoes, with orders to pre&s;erve the greate&s;t &s;ilence, and not to attempt any thing until a &s;ignal was given. The darkne&s;s of the night favoured the &s;cheme. And now perceiving that the Spaniards were under &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment, they took this ad|vantage, and all at once, with great order, poured in their arrows; rai&s;ing at the &s;ame time a mo&s;t tremendous &s;hout, &s;welled with the barbarous &s;ound of all their martial in&s;tru|ments of mu&s;ic. The Spaniards were not wanting to them&s;elves, but behaved with &s;ignal bravery. It were needle&s;s, and almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="97" REF="107">
to relate all the de&s;truction of that horrid night. The Indians at fir&s;t attacked in good order, but the fir&s;t ranks being re|pul&s;ed, and the di&s;tant canoes pre&s;&s;ing on to action, the whole attack was thrown into confu&s;ion, the Indians drowned or &s;laughtered one another: however, they &s;till pre&s;&s;ed on with untameable fury. Thou&s;ands, impatient of the delay their remote &s;ituation cau&s;ed them, leapt from their canoes, and climbing up the cau&s;eway in front where it was inter|rupted, broke in upon the Spaniards in this quarter, with a torrent hardly re&s;i&s;tible. In vain this naked multitude was hacked to pieces by the Spani&s;h &s;words, in vain were they tumbled upon one another by hundreds into the lake; new warriors &s;ucceeded tho&s;e that were killed, and the Spaniards, actually wearied out, were in danger of being wholly cut off; when making one vigorous effort in the front, they happily cleared that po&s;t, and by a beam which they ca&s;ually met, they pa&s;&s;ed over one by one, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, filling the intervals with the dead bodies of their enemies, they gained the main land. Cortes came over with the fir&s;t, for in the confu&s;ion of the night, their former order was in a good mea&s;ure lo&s;t, and took care as fa&s;t as his men got over to form them, to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;age for the re&s;t. Then returning to tho&s;e who were behind, by his pre&s;ence and example, he
<PB N="98" REF="108">
animated them to renew the fight, and draw|ing up a part of his men on both &s;ides of the cau&s;eway, he ordered the re&s;t to file off from the center. In this manner the fir&s;t light &s;aw the Spaniards clear out of the city. Cortes halted at a &s;mall di&s;tance, that tho&s;e whom the confu&s;ion and the night had di&s;per&s;ed, might have an opportunity of rejoining the re&s;t of the army.</P>
<P>Happily they were not pur&s;ued, for as &s;oon as the dawning light unveiled the field of battle to the Mexicans, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which they bought by &s;uch a profu&s;ion of their own blood, they perceived among the &s;lain two &s;ons of Montezuma, who were with the pri&s;oners, and pierced through by the arrows of the Mexicans in the pro|mi&s;cuous and undi&s;tingui&s;hed carnage of the preceding night. For &s;ome time they were confounded and &s;truck dumb with hor|ror at this &s;ight; their &s;entiments of loyalty returned; their monarch, almo&s;t their god&punc; lately profaned by their own violence! now their hands imbrued in the blood of his chil|dren!

divided into &s;everal flying parties, hung over the army of Cortes, and harra&s;&s;ed it without intermi&s;&s;ion; they attacked him in front, in rear, in flank, by open force, by ambu&s;cade, by &s;urprize. Provi&s;ion grew extremely &s;carce on his march; and now it was that Cortes &s;hewed a firmne&s;s under his lo&s;&s;es, a vigilance again&s;t ince&s;&s;ant attacks, &s;o various in time and man|ner, and a courage which enabled him to re|pul&s;e them, which have been exceeded by nothing in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The principal army of the Mexicans, whil&s;t he contended with &s;uch difficulties from the flying parties, took another rout, and pouring in three columns into a plain, where their number &s;hould be of mo&s;t avail, they covered the whole of an extended valley, which lay directly in his road to Tla&s;cala, and this was called the valley of Otumba. They concealed their purpo&s;es with all imaginable care. To blind the Spaniards, they ordered &s;everal vil|lages to give them a friendly reception. But Cortes did not &s;uffer this to relax his vigilance, not allowing him&s;elf to be deceived by any appearances of friend&s;hip &s;hewn by men, who&s;e intere&s;t it was not to be his friends, Convinced as he was, that a &s;urprize of all things was indeed very de&s;tructive to the affairs of a general, but that it was mortal to his reputation. He drew indications of their &s;en|timents towards him, from the manners, the
<PB N="100" REF="110">
ge&s;tures, and the countenances of tho&s;e he treated with in his march; and perceiving that many &s;hewed unu&s;ual &s;igns of content and exultation, he judged not without rea&s;on that it could not be favourable to him. He therefore di&s;po&s;ed every thing in &s;uch a man|ner as that his troops were neither di&s;ordered, nor his courage abated, when from an emi|nence they di&s;covered the extended plains of Otumba, darkened as far as the eye could reach with the myriads of their enemies. The Spaniards, animated by their &s;uperiority in arms, and their former victories, and the Tla&s;calans, by the pre&s;ence of &s;uch allies, and their hatred of the Mexican name, behaved with great bravery and &s;ucce&s;s; neither were the Mexicans inferior in animo&s;ity and courage. But it was Cortes him&s;elf who determined the fortune of the day. Nothing he ever heard was either forgot, or &s;uffered to be an u&s;ele&s;s burthen upon his memory. He remembered to have heard from the Mexicans, that the fortune of the field with them ever followed that of the royal &s;tandard. This was a net o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> gold, elevated on a gilded &s;taff, and &s;plendid with plumes of a thou&s;and colours.

battle, to be a witne&s;s of the behaviour of all his troops, and to give orders as the occa&s;ion required. Cortes pretending to make his principal effort in a quarter remote from the &s;tandard, employed all his foot in that &s;ervice; but heading the hor&s;e him&s;elf, with &s;ome of his brave&s;t officers, informing them of his de&s;ign, and animating them with the hopes of a &s;peedy deci&s;ion, he flung him&s;elf with fury again&s;t the part that &s;eemed lea&s;t di&s;tant from the center. After di&s;per&s;ing and overturning whole battalions, they penetrated to the cho|&s;en body of nobles, who guarded the general and &s;tandard. Here the re&s;i&s;tance was greater, but it was &s;oon overcome, and Cortes's own lance met the general, who was overthrown, and the &s;tandard taken. All the other &s;tand|ards were &s;truck directly, and the Mexicans fled every way which their fear and confu&s;ion hurried them. They lo&s;t twenty thou&s;and men in this battle, and a &s;poil infinite. This victory gave Cortes an undi&s;turbed pa&s;&s;age to Tla&s;cala, and a welcome reception among&s;t his allies there.</P>

<P>LET us now turn our eyes to Mexico. No &s;ooner were the Spaniards departed, than Guatimozin ordered the city to be forti|fied in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t their entrance a third time. He found that a thou&s;and Tla&s;calans were killed in this retreat, upwards of two hundred Spaniards, (the greate&s;t lo&s;s they had yet in America,) and a great number of hor&s;es. He cut off the heads of the Spaniards, and of their hor&s;es, no le&s;s dreaded, and &s;ent them to all the neigh|bouring nations, as an infallible token of his victory; as a &s;ure proof that he was re&s;olved to keep no mea&s;ures with the enemy, and to &s;tir them up to their utter de&s;truction; and he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that numberle&s;s petty nations, well inclined to the Spaniards, fell off, and many that were wavering were confirmed in the Mexican intere&s;t. By this means &s;eve|ral adventurers, that from the fame of Cortes had landed to join him, were cut to pieces be|fore they gained his army. But the negotiation to which Guatimozin bent all his force, was that with Tla&s;cala, becau&s;e this was Cortes's chief &s;trength. He &s;ent large pre&s;ents, and amba&s;&s;adors of ability, and excellent in&s;truc|tions, to detach them from the Spani&s;h intere&s;t&punc; who acted &s;o well, that they cau&s;ed a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="103" REF="113">
divi&s;ion in their favour in the councils of that republic. But Cortes making his military exploits &s;ub&s;ervient to his negotiations, and his &s;kill in negotiation a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his exploits, baffled them at length with great addre&s;s, but not without great difficulty, and the Tla&s;ca|lans were confirmed in his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t a general has an obedient and well united army, he has an engine in proper order to work in his de&s;igns, and he can then execute them with ea&s;e; but the greate&s;t trial of his capacity is to defend him&s;elf again&s;t a foreign enemy, and wre&s;tle with a dome&s;tic &s;edition at the &s;ame time. The &s;oldiers of Narvaez, &s;ince Cortes's return from Mexico, where they were obliged to leave &s;o con&s;iderable a part of their booty, now hopele&s;s of the expedition, be|gan to mutiny, and demanded to be &s;ent home directly to Cuba; nor were his other troops free from &s;ome part of the infection. Whatever could be done by pre&s;erving them in action, without too great a fatigue; whatever a &s;ea|&s;onable yielding, without forfeiting autho|rity, in &s;hort, whatever an able comman|der could do in &s;uch circum&s;tances, was done by Cortes, without any other effect than that of palliating the di&s;ea&s;e; the indi&s;po&s;ition &s;till continued.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he &s;truggled with the&s;e difficulties, which nearly overpowered him, his old enemy, James Vela&s;quez, looking on the &s;ucce&s;s of
<PB N="104" REF="114">
Narvaez's expedition as a thing certain, &s;ent a &s;hip to get intelligence of his proceedings, and about thirty men to reinforce him. The per&s;on who commanded at the port for Cortes, no &s;ooner &s;aw the &s;hip in the offing, than he went on board her, and upon the captain's en|quiry after Narvaez, he a&s;&s;ured him he was well, and as &s;ucce&s;sful as he could wi&s;h. Not doubting this, the captain and his men landed, and were immediately made pri&s;oners. Find|ing how affairs were really circum&s;tanced, they admired the conqueror, commended the &s;tratagem, and chearfully joined the army.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame time the governor of Jamaica, and he too a determined enemy of Cortes, &s;ent three &s;hips with a &s;mall body of troops, in hopes of tearing from him &s;ome part of his conque&s;ts. The&s;e &s;hips were di&s;|per&s;ed in a &s;torm, and were involved in many difficulties; but what is &s;ingular, they all, though &s;eparated, came to one and the &s;ame re&s;olution, which was to revolt from the com|mander, and join Cortes the moment they came on &s;hore: &s;o that the enemies of Cortes now no le&s;s than three times relieved him, by the very methods which they took to di&s;tre&s;s his affairs. The&s;e advantages, though im|proved to the utmo&s;t by Cortes, were certainly not at all the re&s;ult of his contrivance. There is a &s;pecies of a &s;plendid good fortune nece&s;&s;ary to form an hero, to give a lu&s;tre to his wi&s;dom
<PB N="105" REF="115">
and courage, and to create that confidence and &s;uperiority in him that nothing el&s;e can give, but which always makes a principal part of an heroic character. Without this, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for any man, however qualified, to emerge. Cortes was not only fortunate, by being freed from the mo&s;t terrible embarra&s;&s;ment by the arrival of the&s;e &s;uccours, which were never in|tended as &s;uch; but much about the &s;ame time &s;hips arrived from Spain, bringing, on the account of &s;ome private per&s;ons, a rein|forcement of men and military &s;tores; and from the court an authentic approbration of his conduct, and a confirmation of his com|mand.</P>
<P>Fortified with the&s;e, he yielded to the mu|tinous importunities of &s;uch of his &s;oldiers as were earne&s;t to depart; and though he dimi|ni&s;hed his numbers con&s;iderably by this &s;tep, he judged it better to have a well-di&s;ciplined army than a great one, and knew that little could be expected from men who were drag|ged unwillingly to action; at the &s;ame time that their cowardice or &s;edition would infect the re&s;t. After the departure of the mutineers, he found he had &s;till above nine hundred Spani&s;h foot, and eighty-&s;ix hor&s;e, and eighteen pieces of cannon. With the&s;e, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a va&s;t body of Tla&s;calans, and allies of various nations, whom admiration and fear of Cortes, or hatred to the Mexicans, had
<PB N="106" REF="116">
brought under his banner, he once more pre|pared to attack Mexico, which was the grand object of his undertakings. The city was &s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, and he knew at this time &s;o well fortified, that nothing could be done without a force on the lake. To cut off their &s;upplies, he ordered the materials of twelve brigantines to be got ready, in &s;uch a manner as only to need being put together when they &s;hould arrive at Mexico. The&s;e were carried upon the &s;houlders of his Indian allies. His rout to Mexico cannot be &s;o much con&s;idered in the light of a march, as a continued train of ambu&s;cades and battles, ' &s;ome of which were fought with the mo&s;t numerous armies, and with circum&s;tances not &s;uited to the brevity of my purpo&s;e to relate. In all the&s;e he was &s;ucce&s;sful, though his ene|mies may be &s;aid, with little exaggeration, to have di&s;puted with him every foot of ground between Tla&s;cala and Mexico.</P>
<P>At la&s;t that city &s;hewed it&s;elf, ri&s;ing from the mid&s;t of a noble lake, &s;urrounded with a number of mo&s;t populous cities, as her at|tendants upon every &s;ide, and all &s;ubject to her power. The Spaniards now looking on this as their goal, revived their courage, and forgot the difficulties of their march; and the Tla&s;calans, in a perfect fury of military delight, wanted the &s;teady hand of Cortes to re&s;train a courage, which he commended and kept alive
<PB N="107" REF="117">
by his example and words, whil&s;t he modera|ted it's ardor. Before he began the attack of Mexico, he &s;pent &s;ome time in reducing all the neighbouring cities from which it might derive any &s;uccour. He cut off the aqueducts which &s;upplied Mexico with water, that of the lake being bracki&s;h, and he got ready his brigantines with all imaginable diligence to cut off all relief from the lake.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his attention was wholly employed in the pro&s;ecution of the war, an old Spaniard, who had long &s;erved, di&s;covered to him a con&s;piracy of the mo&s;t dangerous nature. An|tonio de Vile&s;ana, a private &s;oldier, but a man bold and de&s;perate in any bad purpo&s;e, and &s;ubtle in contriving it, had formed a con&s;pi|racy with &s;everal others to kill Cortes, and the principal per&s;ons upon whom he relied, and then to return to Vera Cruz, from whence they might ea&s;ily pa&s;s to Cuba, and &s;ecure their pardon by the merit they &s;hould make of this action with James Vela&s;quez. They were urged to this re&s;olution by the fatigue of tho&s;e innumerable dangers and difficulties, they had pa&s;&s;ed, and by the de&s;pair of overcoming tho&s;e which yet lay before them; without con&s;idering that by this wicked action, they &s;hould rather produce new difficulties than overcome the old. Others of more con&s;e|quence were drawn in, and the con&s;piracy had been &s;o far formed, that the time and
<PB N="108" REF="118">
manner of killing him was &s;ettled, and the per|&s;on fixed, upon whom they intended to devolve the command. When Cortes was appri&s;ed of this con&s;piracy, without any hurry that might give notice that he had di&s;covered it, yet, without lo&s;ing a moment to take advantage of the di&s;covery, with four or five of his principal captains, he went directly to the quarters of Vile&s;ana, who, a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing him, made half his confe&s;&s;ion by the fear he di&s;covered. Cortes had him thrown immediately into irons, and then ordering every body to retire, he examined him&s;elf into all the particulars of the affair, and the names of the per&s;ons con|cerned. Vile&s;ana made a full confe&s;&s;ion, and ended it by producing a paper in vindication of their proceeding, which had been &s;igned with the names of all the con&s;pirators. Cortes was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee among&s;t them, the names of per&s;ons upon whom he had great reliance. However, he di&s;&s;embled his con|cern, and ordered Vile&s;ana to be immediate|ly executed. He was &s;hewn to all the army hanging at his tent door. Cortes informed none of the friends he mo&s;t tru&s;ted with the paper he had received; but &s;ummoning the army, he gave them an account of the horrid con&s;piracy that had been formed again&s;t his life; that he had puni&s;hed the per&s;on principally concerned, but that it was with &s;atisfaction he was left ignorant of his accom|plices,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
by the care the criminal took in de|&s;troying a paper, which he believed might have made great di&s;coveries. For his part, as he had puni&s;hed, and was re&s;olved &s;everely to puni&s;h any flagitious attempt again&s;t his life or authority, &s;o he was determined to order both in &s;uch a manner as to give ju&s;t cau&s;e of com|plaint to no man; and if by any accident he had done &s;o, he was ready to give him all rea&s;on|able &s;atisfaction. Proceeding thus, Cortes had the advantage of knowing who they were that wi&s;hed him ill; at the &s;ame time that they re|mained unappri&s;ed of the di&s;covery he had made, and endeavoured to prevent it by a more diligent performance of their duty: he now appointed a guard upon his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Hardly had Cortes &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this con&s;piracy, and made the proper u&s;e of a baffled attempt again&s;t his authority, which was to &s;trengthen and increa&s;e it, than a difficulty of &s;omething of a &s;imilar nature engaged him, and from which he extricated him&s;elf with the &s;ame courage and prudence. The general of the Tla&s;calans envying his glory, and perhaps fearful of the con&s;equence of the entire de&s;truction of the Mexicans, though enemies to his own country, per&s;uaded a con&s;iderable body of the people to quit the Spani&s;h camp. Cortes immediate|ly ordered him to be pur&s;ued. This general had formerly been an enemy to Cortes, and oppo&s;ed him in the councils of his nation;
<PB N="110" REF="120">
but when he &s;aw the general current in his fa|vour, he made a timely change, and came en|tirely into his intere&s;ts. He had now relap&s;ed, and was therefore not to be tru&s;ted any more. Cortes gave orders to tho&s;e who pur&s;ued him to put him to death. The Tla&s;calans who revolted were ea&s;ily prevailed upon to return; and &s;o dexterou&s;ly did Cortes repre&s;ent this affair, that neither the Tla&s;calans in his army, nor the republic, nor even the father him&s;elf of the general, condemned him for what he had done.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="14" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THESE internal di&s;orders being com|po&s;ed, he turned his fortitude and wi&s;|dom again&s;t his open enemies. Three prin|cipal cau&s;eways led to the city, which three towns or &s;uburbs defended upon the &s;ide of the continent. Within were trenches and barricadoes one behind another the whole length of the way. Cortes ordered three attacks upon the&s;e towns, and the cau&s;eways which they defended. The brigantines acted upon the water. Through the whole length of this &s;iege, the bravery of the Mexicans, in defence of every thing which was dear to them, was not more remarkable than the in|genuity by which they baffled the attacks of the Spaniards, and attacked them in their
<PB N="111" REF="121">
turn. On land, on water, by open force, by &s;tratagem, by every method, they plied each other ince&s;&s;antly day and night. But the Spa|niards, invincible under the command of Cor|tes, had the advantage &s;o far, that with infinite &s;laughter they gained the&s;e po&s;ts which &s;e|cured the cau&s;eways upon the &s;ide of the country, at the &s;ame time that they cleared the lake &s;o, that a canoe of the enemy did not dare to appear upon it.</P>
<P>Cortes gained the&s;e advantages, but he &s;aw how dearly he had bought them; he reflected how it would tarni&s;h his glory to de&s;troy &s;o beautiful a city, and drench it in the blood of it's unfortunate inhabitants; and con&s;idering what &s;upernatural exertions of &s;trength had been frequently &s;hewn by a de&s;pairing people, in the la&s;t convul&s;ive &s;truggle for their religion, life, and property, he made u&s;e of the ad|vantages he had gained to recommend the terms of accommodation, which he re&s;olved to &s;end unto the be&s;ieged. He required no more than the acknowledgment of the empe|ror of the Romans, and the confirmation of his right of &s;ucceeding ceded to him by Mon|tezuma, and long acknowledged by the mo&s;t authentic prophecies of the nation, and &s;uch a &s;ecurity as might &s;ettle the performance of this.</P>
<P>Guatimozin, who had done all that bravery and military &s;kill could perform to &s;ave his country, finding the means mo&s;t &s;uited to his
<PB N="112" REF="122">
years and inclinations un&s;ucce&s;sful, though full of that noble pride which becomes and &s;upports the royal character, was now as willing to &s;ave it by the milder and &s;urer way of accom|modation. But the prie&s;ts, who had much influence in the council, either fearful of lo&s;ing their power, or through an hone&s;t, tho' blind zeal, denounced vengeance from their gods upon all who could think of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed a certain &s;ucce&s;s to tho&s;e who &s;tood up in defence of their religion. They had great weight, and the whole council, con|trary to the opinion of the emperor, became unanimous in refu&s;ing all terms. Guatimozin, who yielded to the general &s;entiment with re|gret, and &s;aw the unhappy con&s;equence but too clearly, re&s;olved to fall with the &s;ame &s;pirit that he had lived. <Q REND="inline">"Then, &s;aid he, &s;ince you are determined to hazard every thing, prepare to act in a manner worthy of that re&s;olution. Me, you &s;hall never find wanting to you, or to my&s;elf. The&s;e are the la&s;t good terms you are to expect. What|ever henceforward you demand through ne|ce&s;&s;ity, will be an&s;wered with pride and cruelty. Therefore, henceforward, let no man pre&s;ume to &s;peak of peace, be our exigencies what they will; the fir&s;t that dares to do it &s;hall certainly die; even the prie&s;ts them&s;elves; they are mo&s;t concerned to &s;upport the oracles of their gods."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="123">When he had &s;aid this, with a &s;tern and determined countenance, he went out of the a&s;&s;embly, and ordered the whole city under arms. Cortes, on the other &s;ide, as &s;oon as he found that his propo&s;als were rejected, laid a&s;ide all thoughts but tho&s;e of violence, and commanded a general a&s;&s;ault to be made at the three cau&s;eways all at once, and to carry fire and &s;word into the heart of the city. He commanded him&s;elf in the principal attack. The cau&s;eway was broke down before him, and the breach formed a ditch of &s;ixty feet wide. On the other &s;ide appeared a fortifica|tion of earth and planks. He ordered the brigantines to the &s;ide of the cau&s;eway, to favour the attack, and directing his cannon again&s;t the fortification, made &s;o furious a fire that it was &s;oon demoli&s;hed; and the defenders galled by the ince&s;&s;ant &s;hot, which made a mo&s;t terrible havock, could maintain the po&s;t no longer. Cortes, under the fire of his cannon, and with the help of his brigantines, pa&s;&s;ed over the ditch, and lo&s;t no time to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the other &s;ide, leaving one of his captains with a detachment to fill it up, and &s;ecure a retreat, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary. Then he advanced to attack the remaining barricadoes of the Mexicans, who made a brave defence. The battle raged furiou&s;ly, and as the Spa|niards gained ground, their dangers and lo&s;&s;es grew every moment greater. They had now
<PB N="114" REF="124">
advanced among&s;t the buildings, from whence they were oppre&s;&s;ed with a mixt &s;torm of darts, arrows, &s;tones, and boiling water. Be|fore them &s;tood a cho&s;en body of the Mexi|can &s;oldiers, who made a re&s;olute &s;tand. Du|ring this conflict, the captain who had been po&s;ted to fill up the ditch, thinking it an in|glorious employment to be employed as a pioneer, whil&s;t his companions were in &s;uch an hot action, advanced with all his men, and de&s;erted the nece&s;&s;ary work he was employed in.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Guatimozin, who&s;e eyes were every where, perceived this motion, than he took advantage of it. He ordered tho&s;e who were in the front of the Spaniards to &s;lacken their efforts; for as night came on fa&s;t, he thought it better to allow the enemy to gain &s;ome ground, that he might fall on them with more advantage in their retreat. Cortes as quickly perceived this &s;lackne&s;s, and the cau&s;e which produced it. He found that the breach of the cau&s;eway was abandoned, that nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> approached, and that there was little hope o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a lodgment in the city at that time. He there|fore began to retreat in the be&s;t order he could&punc; &s;etting fire to the hou&s;es, that he might not be incommoded by them in his next attack. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;carcely was the retreat begun, when thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> ears were alarmed by the dreary &s;ound of the &s;acred trumpet, &s;o called becau&s;e it was per|mitted to the prie&s;ts alone to &s;ound it; and
<PB N="115" REF="125">
that only when they animated the people on the part of their gods. The &s;ound was doleful, continued, and &s;trong, in&s;piring a contempt of death, and a dark religious fury. Immediately en&s;ued a horrid cry, which re&s;ounded from all parts, and this was followed by an attack of more than common rage upon the rear of the Spaniards, which was broke entirely, after a gallant and bloody &s;tand. All order was now lo&s;t. The general's commands were drowned in the cry and tumult of the fight; the Tla&s;ca|lans who were in the front threw them&s;elves precipitately into the trench; &s;ome made a fruitle&s;s oppo&s;ition, others attempted to gain the brigantines, whil&s;t the Mexicans on &s;hore, in canoes, wading, or &s;wimming, upon every &s;ide a&s;&s;aulted and &s;laughtered them with the mo&s;t horrid cries, and rage almo&s;t inconceive|able. With difficulty Cortes and &s;ome of his troops e&s;caped on board the brigantines, wound|ed and de&s;erted. A thou&s;and Tla&s;calans lay dead upon the cau&s;eway, many Spaniards, and &s;carce any e&s;caped without a wound. What was the &s;adde&s;t circum&s;tance of all, forty were taken pri&s;oners, of who&s;e de&s;tiny there was no doubt. The other attacks had no better &s;uc|ce&s;s, though in them the lo&s;s was not &s;o con|&s;iderable. The officer, who&s;e imprudence had occa&s;ioned this misfortune, came to Cortes, with tears acknowledging his crime, and de&s;iring to

Cortes, in the mid&s;t of all the&s;e calamitous cirum&s;tances, which lay heavy about his heart, a&s;&s;umed an air of tranquillity, endeavouring to comfort his &s;oldiers with the hope of a timely revenge, and taking all nece&s;&s;ary care that they &s;hould not be attacked unawares. This care was nece&s;&s;ary; for before morning appeared, the Mexicans, elated with their late victory, and under the au&s;pices of tho&s;e gods, whom they believed they had rendered propitious by the human blood which wa&s;hed their altars, and animated by the &s;ound of the con&s;ecrated trumpet, &s;allied out to attack the Spaniards in their quarters. The attack was violent, but repelled

<P>Guatimozin was not di&s;heartened. He pre|pared for new a&s;&s;aults, and had his ruined works repaired to endure tho&s;e a&s;&s;aults, which &s;hould be made again&s;t him&s;elf. Not relying &s;olely on force, he &s;pread a report among&s;t all the neighbouring nations that Cortes was killed; to them he &s;ent the heads of the Spa|niards who had been &s;acrificed, informing them, that the god of war, appea&s;ed by a &s;acri|fice &s;o agreeable to him, had audibly declared in favour of the Mexicans, threatened ven|geance on tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted them, and de|clared that in eight days time the Spaniards &s;hould be all de&s;troyed. The credit of this oracle among&s;t all the Indians, and the deter|minate time a&s;certained for it's completion, gave it the air of truth; for fal&s;ehood delights in general terms and equivocations, whereas the preci&s;e manner of &s;peaking truth, is one of the marks by which we gue&s;s at it. In fact, this &s;tratagem had it's effect, many tribes of Indians, who were upon the point of joining Cortes, embraced the Mexican intere&s;t; the more prudent &s;u&s;pended their re&s;olution; but Guatimozin did not want emi&s;&s;aries even in the Spani&s;h camp, who terrified the Indian allies with this prophecy. Even the Tla&s;ca|lans were upon the point of de&s;erting them, when Cortes counteracted this &s;tratagem in

He re&s;olved to &s;u&s;pend all manner of operations again&s;t, the city for the&s;e eight days, to demon&s;trate the fal&s;ity of this oracle, and to hinder it from being ever again u&s;ed as an in&s;trument to work upon the credulity of his confederates. He prevailed upon the Tla&s;calans to wait the de|termination. In the mean time he &s;trongly fortified his camp.</P>
<P>Guatimozin was &s;en&s;ible that the effect of his policy mu&s;t be weakened every day, and with that idea employed every hour of the day or night to a&s;&s;ault Cortes's camp, but al|ways with ill &s;ucce&s;s. This great commander was always on his guard; and his troops ad+vantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, bid defiance to every thing of an Indian attack. At la&s;t the eight day expired, and with them the terror of the con|federate Indians. The &s;tratagem now operated as powerfully again&s;t tho&s;e who contrived it in&s;omuch that Cortes in a little time found him&s;elf at the head of two hundred thou&s;and men. This was the la&s;t hope of the Mexi+cans. All that followed was only the depart+ing agony of that &s;tate. The city was a&s;&s;ault+ed with redoubled vigour, and now reduced by &s;laughters, fatigue and famine; the Mexi+cans &s;aw the &s;uperior &s;tar of Cortes gain th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;cendant.

and &s;tones from the tops of the hou&s;es, made the progre&s;s of the be&s;iegers &s;low and bloody. In this extremity, Guatimozin did every thing that could ju&s;tify the hopes of the Mexicans, when they called him to the throne, every thing that was worthy of one re&s;olved to die a king. But when he found that all hopes of di&s;lodging the enemy was utterly at an end, his troops half fami&s;hed, exhau&s;ted in numbers and in &s;trength, and no part tenable, he deter|mined to leave the city to obtain the be&s;t terms it could from the conquerors, and to &s;eek him&s;elf a more pro&s;perous opportunity at a di&s;tance. For this purpo&s;e he renewed the treaty with the Spaniards, and took the oppor|tunity of this ce&s;&s;ation of arms to put him&s;elf and his family, with &s;ome of the brave&s;t and mo&s;t faithful of his nobility, on board &s;ome periaguas, attempting to e&s;cape to the continent; but Cortes apprehending this very thing, &s;ta|tioned his fleet in &s;uch a manner, that he was intercepted, and &s;oon out of a condition of making any defence. He went on board the Spani&s;h commander, with an air of dignity and compo&s;ure, betraying neither fear nor &s;urpri&s;e, and de&s;ired no favour, but that the honour of his wife and her attendants might be &s;pared. The Spani&s;h captain attended but little to him, endeavouring to prevent the e&s;cape of the nobility; but Guatimozin de&s;ired him not to be anxious about them. <Q REND="inline">"Not one of

The ruins of the city of Mexico were now delivered up to the Spa|niards. With it fell that empire, and the li|berty of all the Indian nations, which filled that va&s;t country now called New Spain, who either &s;lid gradually from alliances to &s;ub|jection, or defending them&s;elves without &s;uc|ce&s;s, were made, and treated as &s;laves.</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity of the reader will doubtle&s;s be intere&s;ted to know the fates of the captains of the conquering and conquered parties in this war. For &s;ome time the treatment of Guati|mozin was &s;uch as fitted an unfortunate brave man, in the hands of tho&s;e who could e&s;timate virtue by other &s;tandards than it's fortune; and &s;uch was his treatment, whil&s;t the authority of Guatimozin was &s;ufficent to protect him. But the internal avarice of his troops, which at once excited and di&s;graced their courage, not &s;atisfied with the plunder of this opulent city, believed that there were &s;ome latent trea&s;ures within the knowledge of the emperor, which far exceeded all the re&s;t that they had yet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. They often &s;ollicited the captive empe|ror with promi&s;es and threats to make a di&s;co|very, to no purpo&s;e; at la&s;t a number of vil|lains, Juan de Alderete at their head, a name

de&s;erving to be remembered to it's everla&s;ting infamy, &s;eized upon him, and proceeding to the mo&s;t abominable cruelty, laid him upon burning coals, to extort a di&s;covery of his wealth. But their wickedne&s;s could neither extort a di&s;covery of his wealth, nor the &s;ati&s;|faction even of a declaration that he had none to di&s;cover. His countenance did not betray the lea&s;t yielding or weakne&s;s under the tor|ture; &s;ome of his principal coun&s;ellors &s;uffered along with him, and almo&s;t with equal con|&s;tancy. One of tho&s;e unhappy men, over|come by the force of torments, almo&s;t &s;uperior to human &s;trength, turned his eyes, fainting with angui&s;h, upon his prince, and uttered a doleful cry; but Guatimozin an&s;wered him only by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"Do you think I lie upon ro&s;es?"</Q> The &s;ufferer, &s;truck dumb with the&s;e words, and &s;tifling every murmur that might di&s;hearten the others, or di&s;turb Guatimozin, expired in an act of obedience to his prince. This wickedne&s;s was committed without the knowledge of Cortes. He was no &s;ooner ap|pri&s;ed of what was doing, than he ru&s;hed in upon the villains, and re&s;cued their prey, man|gled as it was, from their farther fury. How|ever, this was but a &s;hort re&s;pite. This prince, con&s;cious of his own dignity, and &s;en&s;ible of the ba&s;e u&s;age he received, either endeavoured to &s;tir up commotions, or was &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch a de&s;ign, and Cortes being obliged to
<PB N="122" REF="132">
&s;ubmit the humanity of his nature to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of politics, ordered him to be exe|cuted.</P>
<P>As for Cortes him&s;elf, neither his great &s;ucce&s;s, nor the va&s;t trea&s;ures which he &s;ent into Spain, could &s;ecure him from his enemies; by who&s;e unwearied zeal for his ruin, he &s;aw him&s;elf &s;uper&s;eded in the government of a country, conquered by him&s;elf with &s;o much toil and danger, and which in any other hands had never been effected. He died in Spain, having received a title and &s;ome other rewards from Charles the Vth, for whom he had ac|quired an empire; but by his own de&s;ire he was carried to Mexico, and buried there. It was the policy of Spain at that time to give great encouragement, and exten&s;ive grants, to all adventurers; but when any great di&s;covery was made, or conque&s;t atchieved, they always &s;ent another to reap the benefit of the fir&s;t ad|venturer's labours. This was a policy un+doubtedly good with regard to one object, the &s;ecurity of the conquered country; but like al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> unju&s;t policy, it had altogether as ill an effect another way; the new governors, hungry and rapacious, and &s;carce con&s;idering the Indians a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> human creatures, murdered va&s;t numbers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> them; and exhau&s;ting them by an intolerabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;lavery, in hopes of a &s;udden gain, they depo+pulated the country in &s;uch a manner, as t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> abate very much the advantages which Spai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">

might have derived from &s;o exten&s;ive a con|que&s;t. Cortes him&s;elf was not free from the imputation of cruelty; the bi&s;hop of Chiapa, a good man, who was &s;ent purpo&s;ely to make an enquiry into complaints of this kind, gives a very unfavourable repre&s;entation of his con|duct. He accu&s;es him of having de&s;troyed four millions of people in New Spain. It is certain, whether by his connivance or not, but partly by the nece&s;&s;ity of war, and partly by the avarice and in&s;olence of the conquerors, va&s;t numbers of the Indians peri&s;hed; but on the other hand, it appears that the bi&s;hop of Chiapa was an enemy to Cortes, which, tho' a good man otherwi&s;e, mu&s;t detract from his credit not a little, e&s;pecially as other hi&s;torians differ from him in this point. Be&s;ides, I am well &s;atisfied, that great allowance mu&s;t be made for exaggerations in the number of in|habitants the&s;e countries are &s;aid to have con|tained. More populous, I believe, they were than the entirely uncivilized parts of North or South America; but it can hardly be thought they were &s;o full of people as they are repre|&s;ented to have been, if we can tru&s;t to any of the rules by which we u&s;ually judge in this matter, nor con&s;equently could they have &s;uf|fered &s;uch lo&s;&s;es in &s;o &s;hort a time, without being utterly depopulated, which certainly they were not.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="134">Since I am on the &s;ubject of the&s;e cruelties, and &s;ince they are things &s;o frequently men|tioned, I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the ac|counts are by no means founded upon any tolerable methods of calculation, but thrown down at random in a declamatory way, with a de&s;ign yet further to blacken the Spani&s;h ad|venturer; men certainly wicked enough, tho' repre&s;ented without any heightening colours. The truth is, that great numbers, perhaps almo&s;t as great as are charged, have really peri&s;hed; but then it was in a &s;eries of years, by being reduced to &s;lavery in the mines, and other laborious occupations, to which the Americans are of all people, by their con&s;ti|tutions, the mo&s;t unequal, and by being di&s;|heartened by a &s;tate of unpolitical and de&s;perate &s;lavery, the greate&s;t enemy in the world to in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a notion likewi&s;e pretty common, that the&s;e cruelties were committed partly, if not wholly, upon a religious account, and at the in&s;tigation of the prie&s;ts; but in reality it was quite otherwi&s;e. This unfortunate people found their only refuge in the humanity which yet remained in the clergy, and the influence they had on the Spaniards, though the clergy, who went on the&s;e adventures, were generally not the mo&s;t zealous for religion, and were, as the Spani&s;h clergy commonly are, ignorant enough, and &s;o little principled in the &s;pirit of

the religion they profe&s;&s;ed, or indeed in the nature of the human mind, that they could boa&s;t as a very glorious thing, that one of them had baptized &s;everal thou&s;ands of Indians in one day, without the help of any miracle for their conver&s;ion, and with a degree of good life, which, to &s;ay the be&s;t, was nothing more than common. But of any murders commit|ted by them, or at their in&s;tigation, I find little or no proof at all.</P>

<P>BESIDES Mexico, there was but one coun|try in America which in any &s;ort de|&s;erved the name of a civilized kingdom, and that was Peru. During the latter part of the Mexican war, the Spaniards became acquaint|ed with the fame and wealth of this country. After Pedraria was appointed governor over the conque&s;ts of Balboa, his lieutenants reduced all that large tract which is now called Terra|firma, committing barbarities worthy the man under who&s;e authority they acted. Among&s;t all the adventurers who acted under his com|mi&s;&s;ion, none have made them&s;elves &s;o famous as tho&s;e of whom we are going to &s;peak.</P>
<P>As if it were de&s;tined that every thing in this new world &s;hould be carried on in a new and extraordinary manner, three citizens of Panama, private men, and advanced in years,
<PB N="126" REF="136">
undertook the conque&s;t of Peru, a country known to them only by report, but by the &s;ame re|port &s;aid to be rich, exten&s;ive, populous, and powerful. The names of the&s;e adventurers were, Francis Pizarro, Almagro, and Ferdinand Lucques, a prie&s;t, and a man of con&s;iderable fortune. They entered into this engagement in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. Lucques &s;aid ma&s;s, an oath of mutual fidelity was plighted, the &s;acrament was divided into three parts, Luc|ques took one, and delivered the other two to his confederates. The fir&s;t expedition, in con|&s;equence of this confederacy, was made under extraordinary difficulties, and with very little &s;ucce&s;s. Pizarro, who commanded, &s;pent two years in the &s;hort navigation between Panama and the Northern extremity of Peru, a voyage now made frequently in two weeks, &s;ince the winds and currents are known. He landed, and found that the wealth of the country was as great as he imagined; and that the re&s;i&s;tance he was like to meet in endeavouring to po&s;|&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it, would be full as con&s;iderable. This he put to the proof very early, by taking the ra&s;h &s;tep of attacking the inhabitants at his fir&s;t landing; and thus letting them &s;ee all at once the wor&s;t of his intentions. The difficul|ties he met with, and the re&s;i&s;tance his ill con|duct occa&s;ioned in the country, obliged him to return without effecting any thing con&s;iderable. But neither he, nor his a&s;&s;ociates, after &s;uch a
<PB N="127" REF="137">
length of time, or &s;uch greatne&s;s of expence, were deterred from the pro&s;ecution of their &s;cheme. It was agreed that Pizarro &s;hould go into Spain to obtain an exemption from the government of Pedraria, and to get for them|&s;elves the grant of whatever they &s;hould con|quer. Pizarro (who, though not the monied man, was the &s;oul of the enterprize) was to be chief governor, with the property of two hun|dred leagues along the &s;ea-coa&s;t. Almagro they agreed &s;hould be adelantado, or king's lieutenant; and Lucques, who was a prie&s;t, was to be fir&s;t bi&s;hop and protector of the In|dians. The other profits of the enterprize were to be equally divided. But as this was an enterprize of ambitious avarice, there was little faith ob&s;erved. Pizarro &s;ollicited only his own &s;uit in Spain, and obtained for him&s;elf alone the property of the land, the go|vernment, the lieutenancy, every thing which he was capable as a layman of taking; Alma|gro was forgot, and Lucquez was left his even|tual bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>On his return, this too early di&s;covery of breach of faith was like to ruin all; but Pizar|ro, who knew how to retreat as well as to ad|vance, yielded up to Almagro every thing he could rea&s;onably de&s;ire, and nothing now ob|&s;tructed the embarkation, which, after all, did not exceed one hundred and eighty men.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="138">Before we proceed, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething of the per&s;ons who had the conduct of this great undertaking. Francis Pizarro was the ba&s;tard &s;on of a gentleman of good family. His education was as irregu|lar as his birth, he could not even read; but then he had a great deal of that capacity and fitne&s;s for the world, which is obtained by much &s;truggling in it, and by being early made de|pendant on a man's own indu&s;try. Hardened to life, dexterous in affairs, never &s;etting his heart upon a part of his de&s;igns whil&s;t the total was at &s;take, of a penetrating &s;agacity into the nature of man, artful, bold, di&s;&s;embling, and cruel. Almagro had likewi&s;e enough of that de&s;perate bravery and toughne&s;s of body and mind, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in a de&s;ign of this &s;ort. In their birth there was no con&s;iderable diffe|rence. Pizarro was a ba&s;tard, Almagro a foundling. Pizarro owed nothing to educa|tion; Almagro depended wholly upon his natural parts. But Almagro, bred from his infancy in the camp, had all the &s;oldierly qualities, patient, laborious, and temperate; far from the craft and di&s;&s;imulation of Pizarro, he was all openne&s;s and genero&s;ity, knew not what avarice was, and his cruelty, the common di&s;temper of all the adventurers in this part of the world, was much mitigated by the inter|cour&s;e he had with an Indian woman, who,
<PB N="129" REF="139">
by degrees, &s;oftened the rigour of a veteran &s;ea&s;oned to blood, into &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion to her unhappy countrymen.</P>
<P>The empire of Peru was governed by a race of kings, which they called yncas. The twelfth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was then upon the throne. The fir&s;t of this race, who was named Mango Capac, was a prince of great genius, with that mixture of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which fits a man to make great changes, and to be the legi&s;lator of a forming nation. He ob&s;erved that the peo|ple of Peru were naturally &s;uper&s;titious, and had principally a veneration for the &s;un. He therefore pretended that he was de&s;cended from that luminary, who&s;e authority he was de|&s;igned to bear, and who&s;e wor&s;hip he was by that authority to enforce. By this per&s;ua&s;ion, ea&s;ily received by a credulous people, he brought a large territory under his juri&s;diction, a larger was &s;ubdued by his arms; but he made u&s;e both of the deceit and the force for the mo&s;t laudable purpo&s;es. He united and civilized the di&s;per&s;ed and barbarous people; he bent them to laws and arts; he &s;oftened them by the in&s;titutions of a benevolent religion; in &s;hort, there was no part of America in which agricul|ture and the arts were &s;o much and &s;o well cultivated, nor where the people were of a milder nature, and more ingenuous manners. The yncas de&s;cended, as they imagined, from &s;o &s;acred an original, were them&s;elves re&s;pect|ed
<PB N="130" REF="140">
as divinities. In none, even of the A&s;iatic countries, was there &s;o entire an obedience to the royal authority. But here it was rather filial than &s;lavi&s;h. As to the character of the Peruvians them&s;elves, they &s;eem to have had a &s;trong re&s;emblance to the antient Egyptians; like them, under a &s;ky con&s;tantly &s;erene, they were a people indu&s;trious and ingenious; culti|vating the arts, but without bringing them to perfection; inclined to &s;uper&s;tition, and of a &s;oft unwarlike temper.</P>
<P>The ynca Guaiana Capac having conquered the province of Quito, which now makes a part of Spani&s;h Peru, to &s;ecure him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, married the daughter of the natural prince of the country. By her he had a &s;on called Atahualpa, or Atabalipa. By a former marriage he had a &s;on named Hue&s;car, heir of his other dominions. On his death Hue&s;car, his elde&s;t &s;on, claims his whole dominions, both hereditary and acquired. Atabalipa, the younge&s;t, without pretending to the re&s;t, would keep Quito as his right by the double title of &s;on to the conqueror, and to her who&s;e inheritance that kingdom was, forfeited be&s;ides by the will the dying ynca had made in his favour. This di&s;pute kindled a civil war, which, after various turns of fortune, ended at la&s;t in favour of Atabalipa, and he not only routed his brother's armies, and over-run his dominions, but actually held him a pri&s;oner in
<PB N="131" REF="141">
the ca&s;tle of Cu&s;co. Such was the face of affairs when the Spaniards arrived in Peru, who&s;e remarkable appearance and &s;urprizing feats of arms were every where &s;pread about the country, and cau&s;ed a general alarm. As u&s;ual in frightful rumours, new &s;uper&s;titions begin, or old ones are revived to increa&s;e the confu&s;ion. There &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a tradition among&s;t the Peruvians, that one of their antient princes had a dream, which he ordered carefully to be recorded. He imagined that he &s;aw a man cloathed all over, even to his feet, with a long beard, and leading in his hand an animal, &s;uch as he had never &s;een before; and that at the &s;ame time he was clearly informed of the will of the gods, that &s;uch a man &s;hould rule that country. A Spaniard, whom Pizarro had &s;ent upon an emba&s;&s;y to Atabalipa, as &s;oon as he was di&s;covered leading his hor&s;e upon &s;ome occa&s;ion that made him di&s;mount, agreed &s;o well with this dream, that it is incredible how &s;oon it &s;pread into the remote&s;t parts of the country, and with how great a terror it struck the whole nation.</P>
<P>Atabalipa, newly &s;eated upon a precarious throne, was not the lea&s;t alarmed at this event, for a new erected power has every thing to fear from whatever &s;ets the people's minds, &s;till un|&s;ettled, upon new motions. He re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, that his enemies &s;hould take no ad|vantage of the arrival of tho&s;e &s;trangers, by en|gaging
<PB N="132" REF="142">
them by all means to his own intere&s;t. He therefore received the emba&s;&s;adors which Pizarro had &s;ent with the greate&s;t marks of honour, though their di&s;cour&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting it|&s;elf of very impertinent matter, was very ill interpreted to him, as was his to them. He even went out to meet Pizarro with a va&s;t number of attendants, to whom he gave the &s;tricte&s;t charge upon no account to offer the lea&s;t injury to the &s;trangers, as they were tho&s;e of whom his predece&s;&s;or had foretold, and of the &s;ame divine original, children of the &s;un. But Pizarro, who advanced with other notions to the interview, &s;oon convinced him that a contrary caution was more nece&s;&s;ary. They met near a celebrated temple, the Spaniards drawn up in order of battle, and a party in ambu&s;cade. This circum&s;tance leaves us in no doubt as to the de&s;ign of Pizarro. The fir&s;t per&s;on who addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the ynca, was father Vincent, a friar, who was not a&s;hamed to make his character the in&s;tru|ment of &s;o ba&s;e a crime. He advanced with a cro&s;s in his hand, and began a mo&s;t un|&s;ea&s;onable di&s;cour&s;e upon the birth and mira|cles of Chri&s;t, exhorting him to become a chri&s;tian, on the pain of eternal puni&s;hment. Then he &s;poke with equal eloquence of the emperor of the Romans, pre&s;&s;ing him with the &s;ame good argument to become a &s;ubject to that emperor, threatening him in ca&s;e of

ob&s;tinacy, that God would harden his heart as he did Pharaoh's, and then puni&s;h him with the plagues of Egypt, with other mi&s;er|able &s;tuff, wor&s;e interpreted. The ynca, tho' utterly a&s;toni&s;hed at matter &s;o unaccountable, behaved with decency and gravity, telling him, that he believed that he and his companions were children of the &s;un, recommended him|&s;elf and his &s;ubjects to their protection, and made no doubt but they would behave to them in a manner worthy the off&s;pring of &s;o bene|ficent a deity.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es continued, the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, who&s;e lea&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to Peru was to li&s;ten to &s;ermons, ob&s;erving a con&s;iderable quantity of gold in the neighbouring temple, had their zeal immediately &s;tirred up, and a party of them began to pillage it. The prie&s;ts made &s;ome oppo&s;ition. A di&s;turbance en&s;ued, and a great noi&s;e, which &s;o alarmed our adven|turing apo&s;tle, that he let fall his cro&s;s and breviary in his fright, and turned his back upon his intended pro&s;elyte. The Spaniards who were not concerned in the pillage, &s;eeing him fly, either that they judged the heathens had offered their prie&s;t &s;ome violence, or that Pizarro made u&s;e of this &s;ignal to them to fall on, immediately drew their &s;words, attacked the guards and attendants of the ynca, defence|le&s;s through a religious obedience to their &s;ove|reign's command, and with every circum&s;tance
<PB N="134" REF="144">
of the mo&s;t deliberate and &s;hocking barbarity, &s;laughtered five thou&s;and, which was near the whole number of the Indians, who fell with|out any anxiety for their own lives, pre&s;&s;ing forward with all the zeal and officiou&s;ne&s;s of a mo&s;t heroic loyalty, to the chair of their prince, to expire at his feet; and as fa&s;t as one &s;et of his &s;upporters were &s;lain, the others &s;ucceeded with eagerne&s;s to &s;upply their places, and &s;hare their fate. The ynca at la&s;t was dragged down, and made a pri&s;oner, by an act of the mo&s;t unparallelled treachery, exe|cuted with a cruelty that has hardly an ex|ample, and can admit of no excu&s;e. The plunder of his camp, rich beyond the idea of any European of that time, was their reward.</P>
<P>The unfortunate prince was not wanting to him&s;elf in his captivity. Seeing that his liberty had fallen a &s;acrifice to their avarice, he hoped to relieve him&s;elf by working upon the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. He began to treat of his ran&s;om, and promi&s;ed &s;uch &s;ums as a&s;toni&s;hed the Spaniards into an agreement, nor was the per|formance unequal. On this occa&s;ion not only the antient ornaments and valuable furniture, ama&s;&s;ed by a long line of magnificent kings, were brought out; but the hallowed trea&s;ures of the mo&s;t venerated temples were given with|out &s;cruple, to &s;ave him who was the &s;upport of the kingdom and the religion. Whil&s;t the&s;e were preparing, three Spaniards, who were
<PB N="135" REF="145">
&s;ent to Cu&s;co to &s;uperintend in the work, had means of conferring with Hue&s;car, who quick|ly finding their foible, and the u&s;e his brother had made of it, made bitter complaints of the injuries he had &s;uffered, begging the Spaniards, as the patrons of the oppre&s;&s;ed, to embrace his cau&s;e, promi&s;ing threefold the trea&s;ure for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which Atabalipa was to pay for his ran&s;om. He received a very favourable an|&s;wer. Mean time the Spaniards treated the ynca with all manner of civility, admitted his attendants to him, but no talk of his liberty. As &s;oon as he had been appri&s;ed of Hue&s;car's negotiation with the Spaniards, and Alma|gro's arrival with an additional force, he be|gan to be under great apprehen&s;ions. To ea&s;e him&s;elf upon one &s;ide, he &s;ent immediate orders to have Hue&s;car put to death.</P>
<P>The arrival of Almagro, on the other hand, cau&s;ed &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment in Pizarro's affairs. This commander finding that Pizarro had &s;eized the ynca with immen&s;e trea&s;ures, and hav|ing already experienced his ill faith, con&s;ulted with his principal officers about leaving his part to him&s;elf, and &s;eeking their fortune el&s;ewhere. Whil&s;t this was in agitation, his &s;ecretary, who was aver&s;e to him, gave Pizarro notice of the de&s;ign. In an in&s;tant Pizarro &s;aw how di&s;|advantageous &s;uch a &s;tep mu&s;t prove to him, with &s;o &s;mall a force, all re&s;ources at a di&s;tance, and the country exa&s;perated by the dete&s;table
<PB N="136" REF="146">
action he had lately committed. He &s;aw that all depended upon removing every &s;u&s;picion of him from the brea&s;t of Almagro. For this purpo&s;e, and as &s;omething of an ill mind ap|peared in his mo&s;t ma&s;terly actions, he began by &s;acrificing the &s;ecretary. He informed Almagro of his treachery. Next, though gold was the great object of his undertakings; yet he knew how to relinqui&s;h &s;ome part to &s;ecure the re&s;t. He agreed to divide the &s;poil equally between Almagro and him&s;elf, and to make no di&s;tinction between the &s;ol|diers of either in the di&s;tribution. This made an entire and hearty reconciliation, which was no &s;ooner concluded than the ynca's ran&s;om came in. But this va&s;t trea&s;ure, the capital object of all their labours and villainies, no &s;ooner came into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but in it's con&s;e|quences it was very near being the utter ruin of their affairs. It is &s;aid, and not improbably, that the whole exceeded the &s;um of one million five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, a &s;um va&s;t at the pre&s;ent time; then it was a prodigy. On the dividend, after deducting a fifth for the emperor, and the &s;hares of the chief commanders and officers, each private &s;oldier had above two thou&s;and pounds Eng|li&s;h money. They had now made a for|tune even beyond their imaginations; but the &s;oldiery was ruined, the greate&s;t part of the army in&s;i&s;ted upon being di&s;charged, that they
<PB N="137" REF="147">
might enjoy their fortunes in quiet. This propo&s;al ill &s;uited with the ambitious views of the commanders. Almagro was for proceed|ing in the u&s;ual way, to enforce obedience by the &s;everity of military di&s;cipline; but Pizarro oppo&s;ed him. <Q REND="inline">"Let them go, &s;ays he, they cannot do us better &s;ervice; here we &s;hall have them mutinous and cowardly &s;oldiers, at home they will act for us as recruiting officers with great &s;ucce&s;s; for when it &s;hall be &s;een that common &s;oldiers of &s;o little merit as they, have made &s;uch large fortunes, we &s;hall not long want better men to &s;upply their places."</Q> The de&s;ire of the &s;oldiers was complied with, and as many as cho&s;e to go, who were no incon&s;iderable number, departed. In due time the &s;agacious prophecy of Pizarro was accom|pli&s;hed, and their army never wanted rein|forcements.</P>

<P>IN the mean time the unfortunate Atabalipa, the greatne&s;s of who&s;e ran&s;om only con|vinced the Spaniards of the nece&s;&s;ity of never relea&s;ing him, endeavoured to take advantage of his captivity, to know the genius and man|ners of this people. Among&s;t all their accom|pli&s;hments, there was nothing he &s;o much ad|mired as the art of reading and writing. This appeared almo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible to him,
<PB N="138" REF="148">
though he &s;aw clearly the u&s;e of it. He was at a lo&s;s to know whether he &s;hould con&s;ider it as a natural endowment, or as an acqui&s;ition of art. To di&s;cover this, he one day de&s;ired a &s;oldier to write the name of God upon his nail: he carried this about the army, de&s;iring &s;everal to explain it, which they all did, to his wonder and &s;atisfaction. At la&s;t he &s;hewed it to Pizarro, but Pizarro blu&s;hed, and could make nothing of it. The ynca then perceived it was no natural gift, but owing to education; the want of which he thus di&s;covered in Pizarro, and &s;lighted him for it. This morti|fied the general, and his di&s;gu&s;t, joined to his natural cruelty, and a policy he thought he &s;aw in the proceeding, made him ha&s;ten the fate he had &s;ome time before determined for his unhappy pri&s;oner. That nothing might be wanting to the boldne&s;s and atrociou&s;ne&s;s of their barbarity, they proceeded again&s;t him by way of trial, and by the forms of law.</P>
<P>A charge was exhibited, dige&s;ted under &s;e|veral heads. 1&s;t, For being an idolater. 2dly, For having many concubines. 3dly, For wa&s;t|ing the trea&s;ures of the kingdom, and rai&s;ing taxes &s;ince the coming in of the Spaniards. And la&s;tly, For the murder of his brother Hue&s;|car. An attorney general was appointed to manage the accu&s;ation, and an advocate ap|pointed from among&s;t them&s;elves a&s;&s;igned for his defence. In vain did the more numerous
<PB N="139" REF="149">
and better part of the army prote&s;t again&s;t this proceeding, and lodge an appeal to Spain; in vain did they alledge their want of power to judge a foreign prince for any crimes, and the ab&s;urdity of the crimes with which this prince was charged. Before &s;uch judges, and with &s;uch an advocate to defend him, the ynca was con|demned to be buried alive. To compleat this violation and mockery of all laws, human and divine, the &s;ame father Vincent, who had &s;o &s;ignalized him&s;elf upon a former occa&s;ion, was &s;ent to comfort and in&s;truct him in his la&s;t moments. The chief argument which he u&s;ed to convert him to chri&s;tianity was, that on his embracing the faith, in&s;tead of being burned, his &s;entence &s;hould be mitigated to &s;trangling. This prince &s;ubmitted to bapti&s;m, and was immediately &s;trangled in pri&s;on. Pizarro gave the final &s;troke to his hardened and &s;hamele&s;s villainy, by giving him a magnificent funeral, and going into mourning.</P>
<P>The death of the ynca was no &s;ooner &s;pread abroad, than the principal nobility at Cu&s;co &s;et up the brother of Hue&s;car; Pizarro &s;et up a &s;on of Atabalipa; and two generals of the Peruvians &s;et up for them&s;elves. Thus was this wretched country torn to pieces at once by foreigners, and by a dome&s;tic war among&s;t them&s;elves. Yet &s;uch is the preference of any &s;ort of &s;pirit rou&s;ed within a nation, to a lethar|gic inactivity, that the Peruvians gained &s;ome
<PB N="140" REF="150">
con&s;iderable advantages over the Spaniards, even in this di&s;tracted condition, and took &s;everal pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom was the attorney general, whom they put to the death he de|&s;erved without any great formality. The re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, as &s;oon as they were informed of their having prote&s;ted again&s;t the emperor's death, they generou&s;ly relieved. The&s;e ad|vantages gained by the Peruvians, made the Spaniards li&s;ten to a treaty; for Pizarro was equally ready at all times to make a peace, or to break it, as his affairs required. He made u&s;e of this interval to &s;ettle the Spaniards in the country. It was now that he laid the founda|tions of the famous city of Lima. But as &s;oon as he judged him&s;elf in a condition to pro&s;ecute it, he renewed the war with the Indians, and after many difficulties, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Cu&s;co, then the capital of the empire.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t he was thus by force and fraud e&s;tabli&s;hing him&s;elf every where, the whole fabric of his de&s;igns was &s;haken by a fre&s;h di&s;pute between him and his collegue Alma|gro. The&s;e commanders had little mutual affection, and le&s;s confidence in each other's honour and integrity; for &s;imilarity of man|ners is no ground of friend&s;hip, but where the manners are good in them&s;elves. Their com|mon nece&s;&s;ities, it is true, obliged them for a time to keep a fair appearance; but each &s;ati&s;|fied of the other's ill intentions, watched an
<PB N="141" REF="151">
opportunity of being before-hand in &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter advantage. New grants and &s;upplies had lately arrived from Spain. Pizarro ob|tained two hundred leagues along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, to the Southward of his former government. Almagro had a grant of two hundred more to the Southward of Pizarro's. Judging, or pre|tending he judged, that the wealthy and im|portant city of Cu&s;co was not included within Pizarro's grant, he immediately cea&s;ed to act in &s;ubordination to him, and claimed this city as his property. Pizarro's brother, who com|manded for him there, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to deliver up the place. Almagro in&s;i&s;ted on it with equal ob&s;tinacy, and they were on the point of deciding the di&s;pute by the &s;word, when Pizarro, the moment he had notice of the quarrel, came from Lima, where he was at that time indi&s;po&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding his infirmity, with incredible expedition to Cu&s;co. He told his collegue, that he was not unable nor afraid to &s;upport the ju&s;tice of his claim by arms; but he cho&s;e rather to convince him by rea&s;on; that the ties which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them and their common nece&s;&s;ities, would al|ways touch him with concern to be compelled to violent cour&s;es; which, however they might end in favour of one of them rather than the other, would certainly be much more in favour of the common enemy. He demon|&s;trated to him, that Cu&s;co was indubitably
<PB N="142" REF="152">
within his (Pizarro's) government, and ended in a&s;&s;uring him, that as he would defend his own right with all his force, &s;o he was equally willing to employ all that force, with all his trea&s;ure, and all his council, and whatever a&s;|&s;i&s;tance he could give, to put Almagro into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of whatever was really his right; that this lay yet more to the Southward than Cu&s;co, and was a country no way inferior in it's riches, and the ea&s;ine&s;s of the conque&s;t.</P>
<P>This timely appearance of Pizarro, his dex|terous management, and judicious mixture of firmne&s;s and flexibility, made &s;uch an impre&s;|&s;ion upon Almagro, that he was once more re|conciled; and adding as many of Pizarro's troops to his own as he judged nece&s;&s;ary, he penetrated with great danger and difficulty in|to Chili, lo&s;ing many of his men whil&s;t he pa&s;&s;ed over mountains of an immen&s;e height, and always covered with &s;now. He &s;ucceeded notwith&s;tanding in a good mea&s;ure in his de|&s;igns, for he reduced a valuable and con&s;ider|able part of that country.</P>
<P>There was undoubtedly in the four hundred leagues which Pizarro had &s;ollicited for him|&s;elf, enough of land to &s;atisfy any rea&s;on|able ambition, and &s;omething to &s;pare, to &s;ecure the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t; but his eager|ne&s;s after a large territory, made him blind to the folly of dividing his troops, and &s;ending Almagro upon a wild di&s;tant expedition; and
<PB N="143" REF="153">
yet he con&s;idered this as a ma&s;ter-piece of policy. A little time, however, convinced him to the contrary. No &s;ooner did the ynca perceive this divi&s;ion of the Spani&s;h troops, than he de&s;ired leave from Pizarro's brother, who managed affairs for him at Cu&s;co, to a&s;&s;i&s;t at a &s;olemn fe&s;tival of this nation, which was to be held at &s;ome di&s;tance. This fea&s;t was in reality a &s;ort of an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates of the kingdom. The ynca having obtained permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t at it, made u&s;e of this op|portunity to repre&s;ent to his &s;ubjects in the mo&s;t pathetic manner, the mi&s;ery to which the nation was reduced; the &s;ettlement of the Spaniards, the cities they had built, the garri|&s;on they kept at Cu&s;co, and the guard they had on his own per&s;on. That for their &s;akes he was now re&s;olved to hazard that per&s;on, and every thing that was dear to him; that now was the time to make an effort with &s;uc|ce&s;s, when their enemies, divided among&s;t them&s;elves, had &s;eparated in &s;earch of other kingdoms, to &s;atisfy an ambition that nothing could &s;atiate. The whole a&s;&s;embly united in the&s;e &s;entiments; they rou&s;ed the country every where, and the Spaniards who remained in Peru were not able to prevent the ynca from laying &s;iege to Cu&s;co, with an army of two hundred thou&s;and men. The garri&s;on under Ferdinand Pizarro, though con&s;i&s;ting of no more than &s;eventy men, yet with their ar|tillery,
<PB N="144" REF="154">
the &s;allies made with their hor&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ignorance of the Peruvians in carrying on a &s;iege, their defence was as &s;ucce&s;s|ful as it was brave.</P>
<P>News was brought to Almagro of the dangers to which Cu&s;co was expo&s;ed, and the univer&s;al in&s;urrection of the Peruvians. Re|linqui&s;hing his new conque&s;ts, he ha&s;ted back to pre&s;erve his old with great expedition; though on his return he &s;uffered as much from drought and heat, as in his progre&s;s he had en|dured from cold. At his approach the Indians rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and he was joyfully received into Cu&s;co by Ferdinand Pizarro, and the gar|ri&s;on, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by the length of the defence.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e long and laborious marches&punc; Almagro was extremely fatigued, and though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> it hard, that now in the wane of his life he &s;hould be driven with infinite toil upon new conque&s;ts, while Pizarro &s;ate down at ea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to enjoy alone the fruits of their common labours. He re&s;olved to renew his claim t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cu&s;co; he had now a &s;ort of right to it by having rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and he had a &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;upport that right.

<P><PB N="145" REF="155">Pizarro, unacquainted with the arrival of Almagro, or the &s;tep he had taken, had got together an army for the relief of Cu&s;co, who were near the town before they found they had an enemy of any other &s;ort than the In|dians to contend with. Almagro, after having tried in vain to &s;educe their fidelity, engaged and routed them. On this advantage, his friends repre&s;ented to him that now was the happy hour of his fortune, and that he ought to employ it to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of being moved. That he ought to put the Pizarros, his pri&s;oners, to death, and march directly to Lima, to &s;eize upon his rival, who never could be heartily reconciled to him, and whil&s;t he remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea-coa&s;t, could never want means of making his enmity terrible. Almagro had humanity enough to reject the fir&s;t part of this coun&s;el, and weakne&s;s enough not to hearken to the la&s;t. If he marched into ano|ther's government, he trembled at the name of a rebel; and for fear of the name expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of the thing; not con&s;idering, that having once embrued his hands in civil blood, he ought never to &s;top till his end was gained; that conque&s;t alone could decide the que&s;tion of their right; and that he who had the greater force, would have the be&s;t means of protection, if he was in the wrong. Whil&s;t he deliberated what
<PB N="146" REF="156">
cour&s;e to take, Gonzalo Pizarro made his e&s;cape with an hundred of tho&s;e who were affected to his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It was the intere&s;t of Pizarro, who found him&s;elf in no condition to carry on the war, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the means of being reinforced, to keep matters from coming to an extremity, as it was Almagro's to bring them to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and in this knowledge of the manage|ment of time, when to lie by to gain it, and when to u&s;e the pre&s;ent moment, the great &s;kill in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o little under&s;tood, depends almo&s;t entirely. Pizarro had recour&s;e to the old way of treaty; he promi&s;ed largely, he offered a &s;ea-port, and agreed to &s;ubmit the deci&s;ion of all their di&s;putes to the royal au|dience; but as a preliminary, he in&s;i&s;ted on the relea&s;e of his brother Ferdinand. Expe|rienced as Almagro was in Pizarro's faith, he gave up the only pledge that could &s;ecure it. The moment Gonzalo was relea&s;ed, he was put at the head of the reinforcements Pizarro had long expected, and now received; and as he was a man of capacity, he prepared to act with vigour. The treaty was forgot.</P>
<P>The country which held for Almagro was &s;eparated from that which Pizarro po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by va&s;t mountains pa&s;&s;able only in &s;ome &s;teep and dangerous defiles. Almagro's coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed him by all means to po&s;t his troops in &s;uch a manner as to oppo&s;e his enemies in tho&s;e
<PB N="147" REF="157">
pa&s;&s;es; but &s;o infatuated was he with a fal&s;e &s;ecurity, that he refu&s;ed to &s;end any troops to occupy tho&s;e important po&s;ts, which were &s;eized by the enemy without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. He had, however, one re&s;ource left, and that a good one. The town of Cu&s;co was well fortified, had a good garri&s;on, and the ene|my was ill provided for carrying on the &s;iege. But as he had prejudiced his affairs before by dilato|ry mea&s;ures, he now compleatly ruined them by precipitation and temerity. He turned his back upon the advantages of his &s;ituation, and re&s;olved, contrary to the opinion of all his officers, to hazard his fortune in the field; confident of his own &s;uperiority, and full of contempt of the enemy, whom he believed to be raw troops; but he found too late, that they were veterans of great bravery, and exact di&s;cipline. The engagement was warm; in which Almagro and his troops behaved in &s;uch a manner as not to di&s;grace their former exploits; but after a gallant &s;truggle, they were in the end entirely defeated. Almagro him&s;elf was taken pri&s;oner, and fell, at the age of &s;eventy-three years, a victim to a ra&s;hne&s;s &s;carce excu&s;eable in a young &s;oldier; but to the la&s;t degree blameable in an experienced com|mander, who being &s;uppo&s;ed to have long e&s;tabli&s;hed his reputation for courage beyond all doubt, ought to model his conduct only by
<PB N="148" REF="158">
hie own experience, and the circum&s;tances of the affair in which he is engaged.</P>
<P>Pizarro having got the rival, who had cau&s;ed him &s;o many apprehen&s;ions, into his hands, re&s;olved to &s;hew him no mercy. In &s;pite of Almagro's age, which, as it might re|move his fears, ought to have given room for pity; in &s;pite of their common warfare, their dangers and triumphs; in &s;pite of every &s;enti|ment of gratitude for what this unfortunate man had contributed to his greatne&s;s, and in &s;pite of his late mercy to his brother; all which were pathetically and &s;trongly urged by Almagro, to &s;uffer an old man, and a pri&s;oner too, after &s;o many fruitle&s;s toils, to die quietly in his bed, Pizarro was deaf to every thing but a barbarous policy, which made him &s;ub|mit every virtue to the &s;ecuring the meane&s;t part of his de&s;igns. Almagro was formally tried, &s;entenced, and then &s;trangled in pri&s;on. His body was afterwards beheaded publickly on a &s;caffold, and for a long time denied burial. A negro &s;lave interred it by &s;tealth. Amid&s;t the pity which this barbarous execu|tion cau&s;ed, people could not forbear recollect|ing the unhappy fate of Atahualpa, and the &s;hare which Almagro had in it.</P>

An army once di&s;per&s;ed is got toge|ther again with great difficulty; and on the other hand, a civil war is by no means a cer|tain de&s;truction to tho&s;e who are engaged in it: and indeed by the rea&s;on of the thing, and by the event, it was an ill-judged &s;tep, the &s;cheme of a barbarous prince, who was far from being a con&s;ummate politician.</P>
<P>It was very ruinous to the Peruvians, that happening to be divided among&s;t them&s;elves when the Spaniards came in, they &s;uffered them to interfere in their parties; but it was of yet wor&s;e con&s;equence, that when the Spa|niards were afterwards divided, they interfered them&s;elves in the Spani&s;h parties. Almagro and Pizarro had armies of Indians, by which
<PB N="150" REF="160">
tho&s;e people were habituated to obey them, and to be intere&s;ted in their &s;ucce&s;s; this, joined to the want of any regular plan of de|fence on the part of their king and comman|ders, &s;ubdued that empire to Pizarro with &s;mall trouble, if we con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the object. But having atchieved &s;o great a conque&s;t, it only made Pizarro acquainted with other great tracts which were rich, and might be added to them. He followed the tracks of Almagro into Chili, and reduced a con&s;iderable part of the country. Orellana, one of his commanders, pa&s;&s;ed the Andes, and &s;ailed down to the mouth of the river of Ama|zons; an immen&s;e navigation, which di&s;co|vered a rich and delightful country, but as it is mo&s;tly flat, and therefore not abounding in minerals, the Spaniards then, and ever &s;ince, neglected it.</P>
<P>The death of Almagro, and the influence it had upon the conduct of Pizarro, is a &s;triking example how nece&s;&s;ary it is for a great man to have an awe upon him from &s;ome oppo&s;ition, that may keep his prudence alive, and teach him to have a watch upon his pa&s;&s;ions. Not content with a territory upwards of eight hun|dred leagues long, and of a prodigious breadth, riches &s;uch as none of the kings of his country had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, a juri&s;diction little le&s;s than royal, and an ab&s;olute &s;ecurity by the ex|tinction of the only per&s;on who had any pre|ten&s;ions
<PB N="151" REF="161">
again&s;t him, either through a jealou&s;y which often haunts the happie&s;t fortune, or through a pride which cannot bear even the appearance of any who had once with&s;tood his power, he took a re&s;olution entirely to cut off all that had ever adhered to his rival; he did not know when the i&s;&s;ue of blood ought to be &s;topped; nor that examples of &s;everity on a few create terror and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but that threats of general de&s;truction produce nothing but de&s;pair and de&s;perate re&s;olutions. He was not &s;atisfied with putting many to death, but i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, inhibiting under the &s;ame penalty, that any per&s;on &s;hould harbour, or even relieve an Almagrian with the nece&s;|&s;aries of life. This party was yet numerous, though di&s;per&s;ed and lurking about the coun|try. The heads of them finding that Pizarro was implacable, entered into a con&s;piracy to murder him. They did not want adherents in the city, &s;o that they found means of con|cealing them&s;elves until their plot &s;hould be ripe for execution; but by &s;ome means Pi|zarro di&s;covered their de&s;igns, and &s;uffered them to know he had di&s;covered them. Alarmed at this information, they &s;aw nothing could happen but death at any &s;ide. Twelve of the chiefs marched into the &s;treets at noon|day, with their &s;words drawn, crying out, <Q REND="inline">"Long live the king! but let the traitor die;"</Q> and cro&s;&s;ing the great &s;quare of Lima, made
<PB N="152" REF="162">
directly to Pizarro's palace; the re&s;t followed in different parties. The people being all the while &s;u&s;pended, and in that inactive amazement which the execution of a bold and &s;udden en|terpri&s;e generally in&s;pires, made no oppo&s;ition. The con&s;pirators &s;ecured the avenues; and Pi|zarro, not alarmed until he was &s;urrounded by his enemies, fell under their &s;words, after having &s;old his life dearly.</P>
<P>Thus died Pizarro, by an event extremely memorable.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Pizarro had fallen in con&s;e|quence of tho&s;e cruel and ill-judged &s;teps which he took for his &s;ecurity, the Al|magrians, elate with their &s;ucce&s;s, and grow|ing into a formidable body, &s;eized upon the city, and proclaimed the natural &s;on of old Almagro governor; a youth not twenty years of age, but of a courage and capacity not ab&s;o|lutely unequal to a charge of &s;uch impor|tance, undertaken in circum&s;tances &s;o critical. But though the Almagrians &s;ucceeded beyond
<PB N="153" REF="163">
their hopes, by the con&s;ternation cau&s;ed by the &s;uddenne&s;s of the attempt, and the general di&s;like to the cruel procedure of Pizarro; the major part of the Spaniards were far from ac|quie&s;cing in this irregular nomination of a governor. A con&s;iderable number, and tho&s;e of the be&s;t men, declared, that without inte|re&s;ting them&s;elves in the quarrel of either party, they would wait for the emperor's de|termination, which they expected hourly, and to which alone they were re&s;olved to conform them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things the new governor Vaca di Ca&s;tro arrived. This man was of a good family, and by profe&s;&s;ion a lawyer; but through a more rigid adherence to the &s;tricte&s;t ideas of right and ju&s;tice than is &s;uitable to the coar&s;ene&s;s of practice, he did not make that figure in his profe&s;&s;ion to which his great ca|pacity entitled him. But what kept him backward at the bar, recommended him fir&s;t to the knowledge, and afterwards to the e&s;teem of his ma&s;ter the emperor Charles the Vth, who was a man of too much di&s;cernment not to be &s;truck with a character &s;o &s;ingular as was that of one who was a lawyer, without exerci&s;ing the trade of law, and lived at court without being a courtier. Therefore, without any &s;ollicitation of his own, without any re|commendation from a mini&s;ter or favourite, this man's plain uno&s;tentatious virtue placed
<PB N="154" REF="164">
him in an employment of &s;o great a tru&s;t&punc; When he arrived in the Indies he &s;till pre+&s;erved his character. He acted like one who came neither to make friends or a fortune, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;olely to do his duty; and he &s;hewed favour o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;approbation to all in proportion as they performed their's. Indian or Spaniard was entirely alike to the equality of his ju&s;tice He flattered nobody, he threatened nobody, and whil&s;t he lived with all the mode&s;ty of a private man, he &s;upported all the dignity of a governor.</P>
<P>He was hardly landed, when young Almagro &s;ent him an emba&s;&s;y, explaining the rea&s;ons of his conduct, and propo&s;ing terms; but Ca&s;tro an&s;wered him, that he was come under the emperor's authority, &s;olely to do him and every body ju&s;tice; of which, if a good &s;ubject, he could have no room to complain; if a bad one, he mu&s;t prepare to feel it: he knew no other terms. This was new language to governors in this part of the world, who almost forgot they had a &s;uperior. Almagro therefore was re&s;olved to abide the fortune of war, rather than &s;ubmit without &s;uch terms as might en|&s;ure him the government of his father's pro|vince at lea&s;t. On the other hand, Ca&s;tro would hear of no terms between a king and his &s;ubjects, and therefore &s;et him&s;elf at the head of his troops, which were compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who had refu&s;ed to obey Almagro, and
<PB N="155" REF="165">
gave him battle. The victory was on his &s;ide, but not without a bloody di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Several of Almagro's officers, in hopes of procuring favour for them&s;elves, betrayed his cau&s;e in the battle; but Ca&s;tro was far from thinking their treachery to their leader, could be reckoned a &s;ervice to the crown, and there|fore &s;pared none of them in the numerous exe|cutions he found it nece&s;&s;ary to make on this occa&s;ion. None of the &s;ufferers was more pitied than Almagro, who behaved with the utmo&s;t gallantry in the engagement, as he had done with much humanity and honour upon mo&s;t occa&s;ions. He was taken and be|headed.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of this procedure, whil&s;t it terrified every body, drew no odium upon the governor, who acted clearly without prejudice, or &s;elf-intere&s;t. They looked on the&s;e execu|tions like judgments from heaven which af|flict us bitterly, but leave no room for mur|mur or complaint again&s;t the hand that inflicts them. To the followers of Pizarro, who valued them&s;elves on their late &s;ervice, and murmured that they were not rewarded better than he thought they de&s;erved, he &s;hewed little favour. He told them he could well di&s;tingui&s;h between what was done out of a &s;pirit of party, and what proceeded from a principle of loyalty to their &s;overeign; that they might look upon them&s;elves as very
<PB N="156" REF="166">
happy that he &s;uffered their la&s;t action to obli|terate the memory of all their others. In &s;hort, he proceeded with &s;uch con&s;tancy, that the Spaniards were reduced to an entire &s;ub|jection, and the Indians treated by them as fellow &s;ubjects and fellow creatures. The clergy he made to attend diligently to the duty of their function, and to the conver&s;ion of the Indians, rather than to the acqui&s;ition of their gold. He modelled the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in the exacte&s;t manner. He founded &s;everal towns, and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;chools and col|leges in them, and placed the royal revenues on &s;uch a footing, that the conque&s;t of Peru became immediately a great public advan|tage, which formerly was little more than an object of private plunder. But whil&s;t he re|mained him&s;elf poor among &s;ome of the riche&s;t confi&s;cations that ever were made, and whil&s;t he enriched the royal trea&s;ury with mo&s;t prodigious remittances, the great men at court received no pre&s;ents. This induced them to get a number of judges appointed, who&s;e authority over-ruled that of Ca&s;tro. The end was an&s;wered. Di&s;putes aro&s;e; the colony was un&s;ettled; appeals and complaints innumerable came home, and pre&s;ents from all &s;ides. But what an&s;wered the pre&s;ent end of the courtiers, was near &s;topping up the &s;pring of bribe|ry for the future. In the confu&s;ion that aro&s;e from &s;uch cla&s;hing juri&s;dictions, and the &s;chemes
<PB N="157" REF="167">
of men intent upon their own intere&s;ts, it was not hard for Gonzalo, the brother of the fa|mous Pizarro, to avail him&s;elf of the general di&s;content, and to &s;et him&s;elf at the head of a party.</P>
<P>It was now no longer a di&s;pute between go|vernors about the bounds of their juri&s;diction; Gonzalo Pizarro only paid a nominal &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the emperor. He &s;trengthened daily, and even went &s;o far as to behead a viceroy who was &s;ent to curb him. There was a fleet at this time in the South-Seas, and he had addre&s;s enough to gain the admiral to his intere&s;ts; by which means he was able to over-awe the coa&s;t of Mexico, and prevent any force coming again&s;t him from that part. He even entertained hopes of gaining the Spaniards there to join in his revolt. The court, ju&s;tly alarmed at this progre&s;s, having felt the ill effect of &s;ending men who were recommended to their po&s;ts by importunity and cabal, as they had experienced the beneficial con&s;equences of employing per&s;ons who&s;e character only pleaded for them, they &s;ent a licentiate in divinity, called Peter de la Ga&s;ca, a man differing only from Ca&s;tro, that he was of a milder and more in&s;inuating behaviour, but with the &s;ame love of ju&s;tice, the &s;ame greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and the &s;ame di&s;intere&s;ted &s;pirit. This mildne&s;s of character &s;uited the cir|cum&s;tances of the times, as well as the rigid
<PB N="158" REF="168">
ju&s;tice of Ca&s;tro did tho&s;e in which he was appointed; for as the revolt was now al|mo&s;t general, he could find no friends but &s;uch as he &s;hould make; for though he was inve&s;ted with the ample&s;t authority from Spain, he neither carried men to enforce it, nor money; and the whole &s;ucce&s;s of the expe|dition re&s;ted &s;olely in his own capacity.</P>
<P>When he arrived in Mexico, he declared that his was a peaceable profe&s;&s;ion; that he came not to exerci&s;e &s;everities, but to heal by gentle mea&s;ures the effects of tho&s;e which were formerly exerci&s;ed. He even wrote a very obliging letter to Pizarro, per&s;uading him to &s;ubmit, and offering him a free pardon for him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates. In the mean time he was not wanting in more vigorous mea&s;ures; but by his engaging addre&s;s, and the reputation of his probity, rai&s;ed large &s;ums of money, and &s;ome hundreds of men. Pizarro, puffed up by his &s;ucce&s;s, received the emba&s;&s;ador with great haughtine&s;s, and &s;ent his an&s;wer, which was likewi&s;e that of his a&s;&s;ociates, by the ad|miral; which was in effect, that neither would he yield up his government, nor would they &s;ubmit to have any other governor. The ad|miral had in&s;tructions to try what bribery would do, and if that failed, to fire the city of Panama, and bring off the new viceroy pri|&s;oner. However, during their conferences, the affair took ab&s;olutely another turn, and
<PB N="159" REF="169">
the admiral, in&s;tead of conveying Ga&s;ca a pri&s;oner to Peru, tran&s;ported him thither with all his forces, returning to his allegiance him|&s;elf, and per&s;uading all his adherents to be hearty in the royal cau&s;e. The viceroy did not at all alter the profe&s;&s;ions and behaviour he had u&s;ed in Mexico, but every where proclaiming peace and pardon, at the head of a powerful force, he drew the cities of Lima and Cu&s;co from the party of Pizarro; who finding him|&s;elf obliged to evacuate the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places of &s;trength, with very unequal forces hazarded a battle, in which he was made pri&s;oner. He was &s;oon after condemned and executed, with tho&s;e who had been the chief in&s;truments of his rebellion.</P>
<P>Such an ill &s;tar governed all tho&s;e who had a &s;hare in the reduction of Peru: Almagro be|headed, his &s;on &s;haring the &s;ame fate; Pizarro murdered in his own palace; his brother Fer|dinand kept a pri&s;oner twenty-three years; and his other brother Gonzalo, as we have ju&s;t &s;een, &s;uffering death as a traitor. The new governor having by nece&s;&s;ary &s;everities quieted his province, took effectual care to heal it's di&s;orders by the arts of peace, and to compleat what Ca&s;tro had been obliged to leave unfini&s;h|ed. He &s;ettled the civil government, the army, and the mines, upon &s;uch a ba&s;is as made the province worth the plunder of future viceroys. He carried over two millions to the
<PB N="160" REF="170">
royal trea&s;ury, paid all his debts, and &s;ate down as poor in Spain as he had left it.</P>
<P>The reduction of the great empires of Peru and Mexico, makes almo&s;t the only thing very much worth in&s;i&s;ting upon in the Ameri|can hi&s;tory. A few &s;kirmi&s;hes with a &s;avage people, and &s;ome voyages and di&s;coveries ex|actly re&s;embling each other, changing only the names and &s;ituations, is the matter, which, in my opinion, unprofitably fills &s;o many volumes, and contains very little of either curio&s;ity or in&s;truction. However, when I come to treat of the &s;everal European &s;ettlements par|ticularly, I &s;hall not omit to mention any thing in their hi&s;tory that contains either the one or the other.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. The Manners of the Americans.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Aborigines of America, through|out the whole extent of the two va&s;t continents which they inhabit, and among&s;t the infinite number of nations and tribes into which they are divided, differ very little from each other in their manners and cu&s;toms, and they all form a very &s;triking picture of the mo&s;t di&s;tant antiquity. Whoever con&s;iders the Americans of this day, not only &s;tudies the manners of a re|mote pre&s;ent nation, but he &s;tudies, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, the antiquities of all nations; from which no mean lights may be thrown upon many parts of the ancient authors, both &s;acred and profane. The learned Lafitau has laboured this point with great &s;ucce&s;s, in a work which de&s;erves to be read among&s;t us much more than I find it is.</P>
<P>The people of America are tall, and &s;trait in their limbs beyond the proportion of mo&s;t nations: their bodies are &s;trong; but of a &s;pecies of &s;trength rather fitted to endure
<PB N="162" REF="172">
much hard&s;hip, than to continue long at any &s;ervile work, by which they are quickly con&s;umed; it is the &s;trength of a bea&s;t of prey, rather than that of a bea&s;t of burthen. Their bodies and heads are flatti&s;h, the effect of art; their features are regular, but their coun|tenances fierce; their hair long, black, lank, and as &s;trong as that of a hor&s;e. No beards. The colour of their &s;kin a reddi&s;h brown, ad|mired among&s;t them, and improved by the con&s;tant u&s;e of bear's fat and paint.</P>
<P>When the Europeans fir&s;t came into Ame|rica, they found the people quite naked, except tho&s;e parts which it is common for the mo&s;t uncultivated people to conceal. Since that time they have generally a coar&s;e blanket to cover them, which they buy from us. The whole fa&s;hion of their lives is of a piece; hardy, poor, and &s;qualid; and their education from their infancy is &s;olely directed to fit their bodies for this mode of life, and to form their minds to inflict and to endure the greate&s;t evils. Their only occupations are hunting and war. Agriculture is left to the women. Merchan|dize they contemn. When their hunting &s;ea&s;on is pa&s;t, which they go through with much patience, and in which they exert great ingenuity, and their provi&s;ions once laid up, they pa&s;s the re&s;t of their time in an entire indolence. They &s;leep half the day in their huts, they loiter and je&s;t among their friends,
<PB N="163" REF="173">
and they ob&s;erve no bounds or decency in their eating and drinking. Before we di&s;covered them they wanted &s;pirituous liquors; but now, the acquirement of the&s;e is what gives a &s;pur to their indu&s;try, and enjoyment to their repo&s;e. This is the principal end they pur&s;ue in their treaties with us; and from this they &s;uffer inexpre&s;&s;ible calamities; for, having once begun to drink, they can pre&s;erve no mea&s;ure, but continue a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of drunkenne&s;s as long as their means of pro|curing liquor la&s;ts. In this condition they lie expo&s;ed on the earth to all the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons, which wa&s;tes them by a train of the mo&s;t fatal di&s;orders. They peri&s;h in rivers and mar&s;hes; they tumble into the fire; they quarrel, and very frequently murder each other; and in &s;hort, exce&s;s in drinking, which with us is rather immoral than very de|&s;tructive, among&s;t this uncivilized people, who have not art enough to guard again&s;t the con&s;equence of their vices, is a public cala|mity. The few among&s;t them who live free from this evil, enjoy the reward of their temperance in a robu&s;t and healthy old age. The di&s;orders which a complicated luxury has introduced, and &s;upports in Europe, are &s;tran|gers here.</P>
<P>The character of the Indians is &s;triking. They are grave even to &s;adne&s;s in their de|portment upon any &s;erious occa&s;ion; ob&s;er|vant
<PB N="164" REF="174">
of tho&s;e in company; re&s;pectful to the old; of a temper cool and deliberate; by which they are never in ha&s;te to &s;peak before they have thought well upon the matter, and are &s;ure the per&s;on who &s;poke before them has fini&s;hed all he had to &s;ay. They have herefore the greate&s;t contempt for the vivacity of the Europeans, who interrupt each other, and frequently &s;peak all together. Nothing is more edifying than their behaviour in their public councils and a&s;&s;emblies. Every man there is heard in his turn, according as his years, his wi&s;dom, or his &s;ervices to his coun|try have ranked him. Not a word, not a whi&s;per, not a murmur is heard from the re&s;t whil&s;t he &s;peaks. No indecent condemnation, no ill-timed applau&s;e. The younger &s;ort at|tend for their in&s;truction. Here they learn the hi&s;tory of their nation; here they are in|flamed with the &s;ongs of tho&s;e who celebrate the warlike actions of their ance&s;tors; and here they are taught what are the intere&s;ts of their country, and how to pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>There is no people among&s;t whom the laws of ho&s;pitality are more &s;acred, or exe|cuted with more genero&s;ity and good-will. Their hou&s;es, their provi&s;ion, even their young women are not enough to oblige a gue&s;t. To tho&s;e of their own nation they are likewi&s;e very humane and beneficent. Has any one of them &s;ucceeded ill in his
<PB N="165" REF="175">
hunting? has his harve&s;t failed? or is his hou&s;e burned? He has no other effect of his mi&s;|fortune, than that it gives him an opportunity to experience the benevolence and regard of his fellow citizens, who for that purpo&s;e have all things almo&s;t in common. But to the enemies of his country, or to tho&s;e who have privately offended, the American is implaca|ble. He conceals his &s;entiments, he appears reconciled, until by &s;ome treachery or &s;urprize he has an opportunity of executing an hor|rible revenge. No length of time is &s;ufficient to allay his re&s;entment; no di&s;tance of place great enough to protect the object; he cro&s;&s;es the &s;teepe&s;t mountains, he pierces the mo&s;t impracticable fore&s;ts, and traver&s;es the mo&s;t hideous bogs and de&s;arts for &s;everal hundreds of miles, bearing the inclemency of the &s;ea|&s;ons, the fatigue of the expedition, the ex|tremes of hunger and thir&s;t with patience and chearfulne&s;s, in hopes of &s;urprizing his enemy, on whom he exerci&s;es the mo&s;t &s;hock|ing barbarities, even to the eating of his fle&s;h. To &s;uch extremes do the Indians pu&s;h their friend&s;hip or their enmity; and &s;uch indeed in general is the character of all &s;trong and uncultivated minds.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this ferocity, no people have their anger, or at lea&s;t the &s;hew of their anger, more under their command. From their infancy they are formed with care to endure &s;coffs, taunts,
<PB N="166" REF="176">
blows, and every &s;ort of in&s;ult patiently, or at lea&s;t with a compo&s;ed countenance. This is one of the principal objects of their education. They e&s;teem nothing &s;o unworthy a man of &s;en&s;e and con&s;tancy, as a peevi&s;h temper, and a pronene&s;s to a &s;udden and ra&s;h anger. And this &s;o far has an effect, that quarrels happen as rarely among&s;t them when they are not intoxi|cated with liquor, as does the chief cau&s;e of all quarrels, hot and abu&s;ive language. But human nature is &s;uch, that as virtues may with proper management be engrafted upon almo&s;t all &s;ort of vicious pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o vices naturally grow out of the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, and are the con&s;equence of tho&s;e regulations that produce and &s;trengthen them. This is the rea&s;on that when the pa&s;&s;ions of the Americans are rou&s;ed, being &s;hut up, as it were, and converg|ing into a narrow point, they become more furious; they are dark, &s;ullen, treacherous and unappea&s;able.</P>
<P>A people who live by hunting, who inhabit mean cottages, and are given to change the place of their habitation, are &s;eldom very re|ligious. The Americans have &s;carce any temples. We hear indeed of &s;ome, and tho&s;e extremely magnificent, among&s;t the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians; but the Mexicans and Peruvians were comparatively civilized nations. Tho&s;e we know at pre&s;ent in any part of America are no way comparable to
<PB N="167" REF="177">
them. Some appear to have very little idea of God. Others entertain better notions; they hold the exi&s;tence of a Supreme Being, eternal and incorruptible, who has power over all. Satisfied with owning this, which is traditionary among&s;t them, they give him no &s;ort of wor&s;hip. There are indeed nations in America, who &s;eem to pay &s;ome religious homage to the &s;un and moon; and as mo&s;t of them have a notion of &s;ome invi&s;ible beings, who continually intermeddle in their affairs, they di&s;cour&s;e much of demons, nymphs, fairies, or beings equivalent. They have ceremonies too, that &s;eem to &s;hew they had once a more regular form of religious wor&s;hip; for they make a &s;ort of oblation of their fir&s;t fruits; ob&s;erve certain ceremonies at the full moon, and have in their fe&s;tivals many things that very probably came from a religious origin, though they perform them as things handed down to them from their ance&s;tors, without knowing or enquiring about the rea&s;on. Tho' without religion, they abound in &s;uper&s;titions; as it is common for tho&s;e to do, who&s;e &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence depends like theirs, upon fortune. Great ob&s;ervers of omens and dreams, and pryers into futurity with great eagerne&s;s, they abound in diviners, augurs, and magicians, whom they rely much upon in all affairs that concern them, whether of health, war, or hunting. Their phy&s;ic, which may ra|ther
<PB N="168" REF="178">
be called magic, is entirely in the hands of the prie&s;ts. The &s;ick are naturally prone to &s;uper&s;tition, and human help in &s;uch ca&s;es is generally found &s;o weak, that it is no won|der that in all countries and ages, people have amu&s;ed them&s;elves in that di&s;mal circum&s;tance of human nature, with the hope of &s;uperna|tural a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Their phy&s;icians generally treat them, in whatever di&s;order, in the &s;ame way. That is, they fir&s;t enclo&s;e them in a narrow cabbin, in the mid&s;t of which is a &s;tone red hot, on which they throw water until the patient is well &s;oaked with the warm vapour, and his own &s;weat; then they hurry him from this bagnio, and plunge him &s;uddenly into the next river. This is repeated as often as they judge nece&s;|&s;ary, and by this method, extraordinary cures are &s;ometimes performed. But it frequently happens too, that this rude method kills the patient in the very operation, e&s;pecially in the new di&s;orders brought to them from Europe; and it is partly owing to this manner of pro|ceeding, that the &s;mall pox has proved &s;o much more fatal to them than to us. It mu&s;t not be denied that they have the u&s;e of &s;ome &s;pecifics of wonderful efficacy; the power of which they however attribute to the magical ceremonies with which they are con&s;tantly admini&s;tered.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>LIBERTY in it's fulle&s;t extent is the darling pa&s;&s;ion of the Americans. To this they &s;acrifice every thing. This is what makes a life of uncertainty and want, &s;up|portable to them; and their education is di|rected in &s;uch a manner as to cheri&s;h this di&s;|po&s;ition to the utmo&s;t. They are indulged in all manner of liberty; they are never upon any account cha&s;ti&s;ed with blows; they are rarely even chided. Rea&s;on, they &s;ay, will guide their children when they come to the u&s;e of it; and before that time their faults cannot be very great. But blows might abate the free and martial &s;pirit which makes the glory of their people, and might render the &s;en&s;e of honour duller, by the habit of a &s;lavi&s;h motive to action. When they are grown up, they experience nothing like command, dependence, or &s;ub|ordination; even &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion is indu&s;|triou&s;ly forborn by tho&s;e who have influence among&s;t them, as what may look too like command, and appear a &s;ort of violence of|fered to their will.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle, they know no puni&s;h|ment but death. They lay no fines, becau&s;e they have no way of exacting them from free men; and the death, which they &s;ometimes inflict, is rather a con&s;equence of a &s;ort of war declared again&s;t a public enemy, than an act of judicial
<PB N="170" REF="180">
power executed on a citizen or &s;ubject. This free di&s;po&s;ition is general, and though &s;ome tribes are found in America, with an head whom we call a king, his power is rather per&s;ua&s;ive than coercive, and he is reverenced as a father, more than feared as a monarch. He has no guards, no pri&s;ons, no officers of ju&s;tice. The other forms, which may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of ari&s;tocracies, have no more power. This latter is the more common in North America. In &s;ome tribes there are a kind of nobility, who, when they come to years of di&s;cretion, are entitled to a place and vote in the councils of their nation; the re&s;t are excluded. But among&s;t the Five nations, or Iroquois, the mo&s;t celebrated com|monwealth of North America, and in &s;ome other nations, there is no other qualification ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their head men, but age, with experience and ability in their affairs. However, there is generally in every tribe &s;ome particular &s;tocks, which they re|&s;pect, and who are con&s;idered in &s;ome &s;ort as their chiefs, unle&s;s they &s;hew them&s;elves unworthy of that rank; as among the tribes them&s;elves there are &s;ome, who, on account of their number or bravery, have a pre-eminence over the re&s;t; which, as it is not exacted with pride and in&s;olence, nor maintained by tyran|ny on one hand, &s;o it is never di&s;puted on the other when it is due.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="181">Their great council is compo&s;ed of the&s;e heads of tribes and families, with &s;uch who&s;e capacity has elevated them to the &s;ame degree of con&s;ideration. They meet in a hou&s;e, which they have in each of their towns for the purpo&s;e, upon every &s;olemn occa&s;ion, to receive am|ba&s;&s;adors, to deliver them an an&s;wer, to &s;ing their traditionary war &s;ongs, or to commemo|rate their dead. The&s;e councils are public. Here they propo&s;e all &s;uch matters as concern the &s;tate, which have already been dige&s;ted in the &s;ecret councils, at which none but the head men a&s;&s;i&s;t. Here it is that their orators are employed, and di&s;play tho&s;e talents which di&s;tingui&s;h them for eloquence and knowledge of public bu&s;ine&s;s; in both of which &s;ome of them are admirable. None el&s;e &s;peak in their public councils; the&s;e are their amba&s;&s;adors, and the&s;e are the commi&s;&s;ioners who are appoint|ed to treat of peace or alliance with other na|tions. The chief &s;kill of the&s;e orators con&s;i&s;ts in giving an artful turn to affairs, and in expre&s;|&s;ing their thoughts in a bold figurative manner, much &s;tronger than we could bear in this part of the world, and with ge&s;tures equally violent, but often extremely natural and expre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>When any bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence is tran&s;acted, they appoint a fea&s;t upon the occa&s;ion, of which almo&s;t the whole na|tion partakes. There are le&s;&s;er fea&s;ts upon matters of le&s;s general concern, to which
<PB N="172" REF="182">
none are invited but they who are engaged in that particular bu&s;ine&s;s. At the&s;e fea&s;ts it is a|gain&s;t all rule to leave any thing; &s;o that if they cannot con&s;ume all, what remains is thrown in|to the fire, for they look upon fire as a thing &s;acred, and in all probability the&s;e fea&s;ts were anciently &s;acrifices. Before the entertainment is ready, the principal per&s;on begins a &s;ong, the &s;ubject of which is the fabulous or real hi&s;tory of their nation, the remarkable events which have happened, and whatever matters may make for their honour or in&s;truction. The others &s;ing in their turn. They have dances too, with which they accompany their &s;ongs, chiefly of a martial kind; and no &s;olemnity or public bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on without &s;uch &s;ongs and dances. Every thing is tran&s;acted among&s;t them with much cere|mony; which in a barbarous people is nece&s;|&s;ary; for nothing el&s;e could hinder all their affairs from going to confu&s;ion; be&s;ides that the ceremonies contribute to fix all tran&s;actions the better in their memory.</P>
<P>To help their memory, they have bits of &s;mall &s;hells or beads of different colours, which have all a different meaning, according to their colour or arrangement. At the end of every matter they di&s;cour&s;e upon, when they treat with a foreign &s;tate, they deliver one of the&s;e belts. If they &s;hould omit this ceremony, what they &s;ay pa&s;&s;es for nothing. The&s;e
<PB N="173" REF="183">
belts are carefully trea&s;ured up in each town, and they &s;erve for the public records of the nation; and to the&s;e they occa&s;ionally have recour&s;e, when any conte&s;ts happen between them and their neighbours. Of late, as the matter of which the&s;e belts is made is grown &s;carce, they often give &s;ome &s;kins in the place of the wampum, for &s;o they call the&s;e beads in their language, and receive in return pre&s;ents of a more valuable nature; for neither will they con&s;ider what our commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ay to be of any weight, unle&s;s &s;ome pre&s;ent accompanies each propo&s;al.</P>
<P>The &s;ame council of their elders, which re|gulates whatever regards the external policy of the &s;tate, has the charge likewi&s;e of it's internal peace and order. Their &s;uits are few and quickly decided, having neither property nor art enough to render them perplexed or tedious. Criminal matters come before the &s;ame juri&s;diction, when they are &s;o flagrant as to become a national concern. In ordinary ca&s;es, the crime is either revenged or compro|mi&s;ed by the parties concerned. If a murder is committed, the family which has lo&s;t a relation, prepares to retaliate on that of the offender. They often kill the murderer, and when this happens, the kindred of the la&s;t per|&s;on &s;lain look upon them&s;elves to be as much injured, and think them&s;elves as much ju&s;tified in taking vengeance, as if the violence had not
<PB N="174" REF="184">
begun among&s;t them&s;elves. But in general things are determined in a more amicable manner. The offender ab&s;ents him&s;elf; his friends &s;end a compliment of condolance to tho&s;e of the party murdered; pre&s;ents are offered, which are rarely refu&s;ed; the head of the family appears, who in a formal &s;peech delivers the pre&s;ents, which con&s;i&s;t often of above &s;ixty articles, every one of which is given to cancel &s;ome part of the offence, and to a&s;&s;uage the grief of the &s;uffering party. With the fir&s;t he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"By this I remove the hatchet from the wound, and make it fall out of the hands of him who is prepared to re|venge the injury;"</Q> with the &s;econd, <Q REND="inline">"I dry up the blood of that wound;"</Q> and &s;o on, in apt figures, taking away one by one all the ill con&s;equences of the murder. As u&s;ual, the whole ends in mutual fea&s;ting, &s;ongs, and dances. If the murder is committed by one of the &s;ame family, or cabbin, that cabbin has the full right of judgment, without appeal, within it&s;elf, either to puni&s;h the guilty with death, or to pardon him, or to force him to give &s;ome recompence to the wife or children of the &s;lain. All this while the &s;upreme au|thority of the nation looks on unconcerned, and never rou&s;es its &s;trength, nor exerts the fulne&s;s of a power more revered than felt, but upon &s;ome &s;ignal occa&s;ion. Then the power &s;eems equal to the occa&s;ion. Every
<PB N="175" REF="185">
one ha&s;tens to execute the orders of their &s;enate; nor ever was any in&s;tance of di&s;loyalty or rebellion known among&s;t this people. Governed as they are by manners, not by laws, example, education, and the con&s;tant practice of their ceremonies, gives them the mo&s;t tender affection for their country, and in&s;pires them with mo&s;t religious regard for their con&s;titution, and the cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors. The want of laws, and of an uni|form &s;trong coercive power, is not perceived in a narrow &s;ociety, where every man has his eye upon his neighbour, and where the whole bent of every thing they do is to &s;trengthen tho&s;e natural ties by which &s;o|ciety is principally cemented. Family love, rare among&s;t us, is a national virtue among&s;t them, of which all partake. Friend&s;hips there are among&s;t them, fit to vie with tho&s;e of fabulous antiquity; and where &s;uch friend|&s;hips are &s;een to grow, the families concerned congratulate them&s;elves as upon an acqui&s;ition, that promi&s;es to them a mutual &s;trength, and to their nation the greate&s;t honour and ad|vantage.</P>

<P>THE lo&s;s of any one of their people, whether by a natural death, or by war, is lamented by the whole town he belongs to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The towns are &s;mall, and except the affairs of war, or &s;tate, they have no bu&s;ine&s;s to employ them, for the greate&s;t part of the year, after the hunting &s;ea&s;on is over.</NOTE>. In &s;uch circum&s;tances no bu&s;ine&s;s is taken in hand, however im|portant, nor any rejoicing permitted, how|ever intere&s;ting the occa&s;ion, until all the pious ceremonies due to the dead are per|formed. The&s;e are always performed with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity. The dead body is wa&s;hed, anointed, and painted, &s;o as in &s;ome mea&s;ure to abate the horrors of death. Then the women lament the lo&s;s with the mo&s;t bit|ter cries, and the mo&s;t hideous howlings, in|termixed with &s;ongs, which celebrate the great actions of the decea&s;ed, and tho&s;e of his ance&s;|tors. The men mourn in a le&s;s extravagant manner. The whole village attends the body to the grave, which is interred, habited in their mo&s;t &s;umptuous ornaments. With the body of the decea&s;ed are placed his bow and arrows, with what he valued mo&s;t in his life, and pro|vi&s;ions for the long journey he is to take; for they hold the immortality of the &s;oul univer|&s;ally, but their idea is gro&s;s. Fea&s;ting attends this, as it does every &s;olemnity. After the fune|ral,
<PB N="177" REF="187">
they who are nearly allied to the decea&s;ed, conceal them&s;elves in their huts for a con&s;i|derable time to indulge their grief. The com|plimen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s of condolance are never omitted, nor are pre&s;ents wanting upon this occa&s;ion. After &s;ome time they revi&s;it the grave; they renew their &s;orrow; they new cloath the remains of the body, and act over again the &s;olemnities of the fir&s;t funeral.</P>
<P>Of all their in&s;tances of regard to their de|cea&s;ed friends, none is &s;o &s;triking as what they call the fea&s;t of the dead, or the fea&s;t of &s;ouls. The day for this ceremony is ap|pointed in the council of their chiefs, who give orders for every thing, which may enable them to celebrate it with pomp and magnifi|cence. The riches of the nation is exhau&s;ted on this occa&s;ion, and all their ingenuity di&s;|played. The neighbouring people are invited to partake of the fea&s;t, and to be witne&s;&s;es of the &s;olemnity. At this time, all who have died &s;ince the la&s;t &s;olemn fea&s;t of that kind, are taken out of their graves. Tho&s;e who have been interred at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the villages are diligently &s;ought for, and brought to this great rendevous of carca&s;&s;es. It is not difficult to conceive the horror of this general di&s;interment. I cannot paint it in a more lively manner than it is done by Lafitau.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Without que&s;tion, &s;ays he, the opening of the&s;e tombs di&s;play one of the mo&s;t &s;triking

&s;cenes that can be conceived; this humbling pourtrait of human mi&s;ery, in &s;o many images of death, wherein &s;he &s;eems to take a plea&s;ure to paint her&s;elf in a thou&s;and various &s;hapes of horror, in the &s;everal carca&s;&s;es, according to the degree in which corruption has pre|vailed over them, or the manner in which it has attacked them. Some appear dry and withered; others have a &s;ort of parchment upon their bones; &s;ome look as if they were baked and &s;moaked, without any appearance of rottenne&s;s; &s;ome are ju&s;t turning towards the point of putrefaction; whil&s;t others are all &s;warming with worms, and drowned in corruption. I know not which ought to &s;trike us mo&s;t, the horror of &s;o &s;hocking a &s;ight, or the tender piety and affection of the&s;e poor people towards their departed friends; for nothing de&s;erves our admiration more, than that eager diligence and attention with which they di&s;charge this melancholy duty of their tenderne&s;s; gathering up care|fully even the &s;malle&s;t bones; handling the carca&s;&s;es, di&s;gu&s;tful as they are, with every thing loath&s;ome; clean&s;ing them from the worms, and carrying them upon their &s;houl|ders through tire&s;ome journeys of &s;everal days, without being di&s;couraged by their in&s;upportable &s;tench, and without &s;uffer|ing any other emotions to ari&s;e, than tho&s;e of regret, for having lo&s;t per&s;ons who were
<PB N="179" REF="189">
&s;o dear to them in their lives, and &s;o lamented in their death."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;trange fe&s;tival is the mo&s;t magnificent and &s;olemn which they have; not only on ac|count of the great concour&s;e of natives and &s;trangers, and of the pompous reinterment they give to their dead, whom they dre&s;s in the fine&s;t &s;kins they can get, after having ex|po&s;ed them &s;ome time in this pomp; but for the games of all kinds which they celebrate upon the occa&s;ion, in the &s;pirit of tho&s;e which the ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated upon &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In this manner do they endeavour to &s;ooth the calamities of life, by the honours they pay their dead; honours, which are the more chearfully paid, becau&s;e in his turn each man expects to receive them him&s;elf. Tho' among&s;t the&s;e &s;avage nations this cu&s;tom is impre&s;&s;ed with &s;trong marks of the ferocity of their nature, an honour for the dead, a tender feeling of their ab&s;ence, and a revival of their memory, are &s;ome of the mo&s;t excellent in|&s;truments for &s;moothing our rugged nature into humanity. In civilized nations &s;uch ceremonies are le&s;s practi&s;ed, becau&s;e other in&s;truments for the &s;ame purpo&s;es are le&s;s wanted; but it is certain a regard for the dead is ancient and univer&s;al.</P>
<P>Tho' the women in America have gene|rally the laborious part of the oeconomy upon them&s;elves, yet they are far from being the
<PB N="180" REF="190">
&s;laves they appear, and are not at all &s;ubject to the great &s;ubordination in which they are placed in countries where they &s;eem to be more re&s;pected. On the contrary, all the ho|nours of the nation are on the &s;ide of the wo|men. They even hold their councils, and have their &s;hare in all deliberations which concern the &s;tate; nor are they found inferior to the part they act. Polygamy is practi&s;ed by &s;ome na|tions, but it is not general. In mo&s;t they con|tent them&s;elves with one wife, but a divorce is admitted, and for the &s;ame cau&s;es that it was allowed among&s;t the Jews, Greeks, and Ro|mans. No nation of the Americans is with|out a regular marriage, in which there are many ceremonies; the principal of which is, the bride's pre&s;enting the bridegroom with a plate of their corn.</P>
<P>Incontinent before wedlock, after marriage the cha&s;tity of their women is remarkable. The puni&s;hment of the adultere&s;s, as well as that of the adulterer, is in the hands of the hu&s;band him&s;elf; and it is often &s;evere, as in|flicted by one who is at once the party and the judge. Their marriages are not fruitful, &s;eldom producing above two or three children, but they are brought forth with le&s;s pain than our women &s;uffer upon &s;uch occasions, and with little con&s;equent weakne&s;s. Probably, that &s;evere life which both &s;exes lead, is not favour|able to procreation. And the habit unmarri|ed women have of procuring abortions, in
<PB N="181" REF="191">
which they rarely fail, makes them the more unfit for bearing children afterwards. This is one of the rea&s;ons of the depopulation of America; for whatever lo&s;&s;es they &s;uffer, ei|ther by epidemical di&s;ea&s;es or by war, are re|paired &s;lowly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST the &s;ole occupation of the American is war, or &s;uch an exer|ci&s;es as qualies him for it. His whole glory con&s;i&s;ts in this; and no man is at all con&s;idered until he has increa&s;ed the &s;trength of his country with a captive, or adorned his hou&s;e with the &s;calp of one of it's enemies. When the ancients re&s;olve upon war, they do not always declare what nation it is they are determined to attack; that the enemy, upon whom they really intend to fall, may be off his guard. Nay, they even &s;ome|times let years pa&s;s over without committing any act of ho&s;tility, that the vigilance of all may be unbent by the long continuance of the watch, and the uncertainty of the danger. In the mean time they are not idle at home. The principal captain &s;ummons the youth of the town to which he belongs; the war ket|tle is &s;et on the fire; the war &s;ongs and dances commence; the hatchet is &s;ent to all the villages of the &s;ame nation, and to all its
<PB N="182" REF="192">
allies; the fire catches, the war &s;ongs are heard in all parts, and the mo&s;t hideous howlings continue without intermi&s;&s;ion day and night over that whole tract of country. The women add their cries to tho&s;e of the men, lamenting tho&s;e whom they have either lo&s;t in war, or by a natural death, and demanding their places to be &s;upplied from their enemies, &s;timulating the young men by a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, which women know to excite in the &s;tronge&s;t man|ner, and can take the be&s;t advantage of when excited.</P>
<P>When by the&s;e, and every other means, the fury of the nation is rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t height, and all long to embrew their hands in blood, the war captain prepares the fea&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ts of dogs fle&s;h. All that par|take of this fea&s;t receive little billets, which are &s;o many engagements which they take to be faithful to each other, and obedient to their commander. None are forced to the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">, but when they have accepted this billet, they are looked upon as li&s;ted, and it is then death to recede. All the warriors in this a&s;&s;embly have their faces blackened with charcoal, intermixed with da&s;hes and &s;treaks of vermillion, which give them a mo&s;t horrid appearance. Their hair is dre&s;&s;ed up in an odd manner, with feathers of various kinds. In this a&s;&s;embly, which is preparatory to their military expedition, the chief begins the war
<PB N="183" REF="193">
&s;ong; which having continued for &s;ome time, he rai&s;es his voice to the highe&s;t pitch, and turning off &s;uddenly to a &s;ort of prayer, he ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the god of war, whom they call Are&s;koui. <Q REND="inline">"I invoke thee, &s;ays he, to be favourable to my enterpri&s;e! I invoke thy care upon me and my family! I invoke ye likewi&s;e, all ye &s;pirits and demons good and evil! All ye that are in the &s;kies, or on the earth, or under the earth, to pour de|&s;truction upon our enemies, and to return me and my companions &s;afely to our country."</Q> All the warriors join him in this prayer with &s;houts and acclamations. The captain renews his &s;ong, &s;trikes his club again&s;t the &s;takes of his cottage, and begins the war dance, accom|panied with the &s;houts of all his companions, which continue as long as he dances.</P>
<P>The day appointed for their departure being arrived, they take leave of their friends; they change their cloaths, or whatever moveables they have, in token of mutual friend&s;hip; their wives and female relations go out before them, and attend at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town. The warriors march out all dre&s;t in their fine&s;t apparel, and mo&s;t &s;howy orna|ments, regularly one after another, for they never march in rank. The chief walks &s;low|ly on before them, singing the death &s;ong, whil&s;t the re&s;t ob&s;erve the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence. When they come up to their women,
<PB N="184" REF="194">
they deliver up to them all their finery, put on their wor&s;t cloaths, and then proceed as their commander thinks fit.</P>
<P>Their motives for engaging in a war are rarely tho&s;e views which excite us to it. They have no other end but the glory of the victory, or the benefit of the &s;laves which it enables them to add to their nation, or &s;acrifice to their brutal fury; and it is rare that they take any pains to give their wars even a colour of ju&s;tice. It is no way uncommon among them for the young men to make fea&s;ts of dogs fle&s;h, and war dances, in &s;mall parties, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t profound peace. They fall &s;ome|times on one nation, &s;ometimes on another, and &s;urprize &s;ome of their hunters, whom they &s;calp or bring home as pri&s;oners. Their &s;enators wink at this, or rather encourage it, as it tends to keep up the martial &s;pirit of their people, inures them to watchfulne&s;s and hard|&s;hip, and gives them an early ta&s;te for blood.</P>
<P>The qualities in an Indian war are vigi|lance and attention, to give and to avoid a &s;urprize; and patience and &s;trength, to en|dure the intolerable fatigues and hard&s;hips which always attend it. The nations of Ame|rica are at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from each other with a va&s;t de&s;art frontier, and hid in the bo&s;om of hideous, and almo&s;t boundle&s;s fore&s;ts. The&s;e mu&s;t be traver&s;ed before they meet an enemy, who is often at &s;uch a di&s;tance
<PB N="185" REF="195">
as might be &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent either quarrel or danger. But notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecrecy of the de&s;tination of the party that fir&s;t moves, the enemy has frequently notice of it, is prepared for the attack, and ready to take advantage in the &s;ame manner of the lea&s;t want of vi|gilance in the aggre&s;&s;ors. Their whole art of war con&s;i&s;ts in this: they never fight in the open field, but upon &s;ome very extraordinary occa&s;ions; not from cowardice, for they are brave; but they de&s;pi&s;e this method, as un|worthy an able warrior, and as an affair in which fortune governs more than prudence. The principal things which help them to find out their enemies are the &s;moke of their fires, which they &s;mell at a di&s;tance almo&s;t incredible; and their tracks, in the di&s;covery and di&s;tingui&s;hing of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;agacity equally a&s;toni&s;hing; for they will tell in the foot&s;teps, which to us would &s;eem mo&s;t confu&s;ed, the number of men that have pa&s;&s;ed, and the length of time &s;ince they have pa&s;&s;ed; they even go &s;o far as to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;everal nations by the different marks of their feet, and to perceive foot&s;teps, where we could di&s;tingui&s;h nothing le&s;s. A mind diligently intent upon one thing, and exerci&s;ed by long experience, will go lengths at fir&s;t view &s;carcely credible.</P>
<P>But as they who are attacked have the &s;ame knowledge, and know how to draw the
<PB N="186" REF="196">
&s;ame advantages from it, their great addre&s;s is to baffle each other in the&s;e points. On the expedition they light no fire to warm them|&s;elves, or prepare their victuals, but &s;ub&s;i&s;t merely on the mi&s;erable pittance of &s;ome of their meal mixed with water; they lie clo&s;e to the ground all day, and march only in the night. As they march in their u&s;ual order in files, he that clo&s;es the rear diligently covers his own tracks, and tho&s;e of all who preceded him, with leaves. If any &s;tream occurs in their rout, they march in it for a con&s;iderable way to foil their pur&s;uers. When they halt to re&s;t and refre&s;h them&s;elves, &s;couts are &s;ent out on every &s;ide to reconnoitre the country, and beat up every place where they &s;u&s;pect an enemy may lie perdue. In this manner they often enter a village, whil&s;t the &s;trength of the nation is employed in hunt|ing, and ma&s;&s;acre all the helple&s;s old men, women, and children, or make pri&s;oners as many as they judge they can manage, or have &s;trength enough to be u&s;eful to their nation.</P>
<P>They often cut off &s;mall parties of men in their huntings; but when they di&s;cover an army of their enemies, their way is to throw them&s;elves flat on their faces among&s;t the withered leaves, the colour of which their bodies are painted to re&s;emble exactly. They generally let a part pa&s;s unmole&s;ted, and then ri&s;ing a little, they take aim, for they
<PB N="187" REF="197">
are excellent mark&s;men, and &s;etting up a mo&s;t tremendous &s;hout, which they call the war cry, they pour a &s;torm of mu&s;quet bullets upon the enemy; for they have long &s;ince laid a&s;ide the u&s;e of arrows; the party attacked re|turns the &s;ame cry. Every man in ha&s;te covers him&s;elf with a tree, and returns the fire of the adver&s;e party; as &s;oon they rai&s;e them&s;elves from the ground to give the &s;econd fire.</P>
<P>After fighting &s;ome time in this manner, the party which thinks it has the advantage ru&s;hes out of it's cover; with &s;mall axes in their hands, which they dart with great addre&s;s and dexterity; they redouble their cries, intimidating their enemies with me|naces, and encouraging each other with a boa&s;tful di&s;play of their own brave actions. Thus being come hand to hand, the conte&s;t is &s;oon decided; and the conquerors &s;atiate their &s;avage fury with the mo&s;t &s;hocking in|&s;ults and barbarities to the dead, biting their fle&s;h, tearing the &s;calp from their heads, and wallowing in their blood like wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The fate of their pri&s;oners is the mo&s;t &s;evere of all. During the greate&s;t part of their journey homewards they &s;uffer no injury. But when they arrive at the territories of the conquering &s;tate, or at tho&s;e of their allies, the people from every village meet them, and think they &s;hew their attachment to their friends by their barbarous treatment of the unhappy pri&s;oners; &s;o
<PB N="188" REF="198">
that when they come to their &s;tation, they are wounded and brui&s;ed in a terrible manner. The conquerors enter the town in triumph. The war captain waits upon the head men, and in a low voice gives them a circum&s;tantial account of every particular of the expedition, of the damage the enemy has &s;uffered, and his own lo&s;&s;es in it. This done, the public orator re|lates the whole to the people, Before they yield to the joy which the victory occa&s;ions, they lament the friends which they have lo&s;t in the pur&s;uit of it. The parties mo&s;t nearly concerned are afflicted apparently with a deep and real &s;orrow. But by one of tho&s;e &s;trange turns of the human mind, fa&s;hioned to any thing by cu&s;tom, as if they were di&s;ciplined in their grief, upon the &s;ignal for rejoicing, in a moment all tears are wiped from their eyes, and they ru&s;h into an extravagance and phren|zy of joy for their victory.</P>
<P>In the mean time the fate of the pri&s;oners remains undecided, until the old men meet, and determine concerning the di&s;tribution. It is u&s;ual to offer a &s;lave to each hou&s;e that has lo&s;t a friend; giving the preference according to the greatne&s;s of the lo&s;s. The per&s;on who has taken the captive attends him to the door of the cottage to which he is delivered, and with him gives a belt of wampum, to &s;hew that he has fulfilled the purpo&s;e of the expedition in &s;upplying the lo&s;s of a citizen. They view
<PB N="189" REF="199">
the pre&s;ent which is made them for &s;ome time, and according as they think him or her, for it is the &s;ame, proper or improper for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the family, or as they take a capri|cious liking or di&s;plea&s;ure to the countenance of the victim, or in proportion to their natural barbarity, or their re&s;entment for their lo&s;&s;es, they de&s;tine concerning him, to receive him in|to the family, or &s;entence him to death. If the latter, they throw away the belt with in|dignation. Then it is no longer in the pow|er of any one to &s;ave him. The nation is a&s;|&s;embled as upon &s;ome great &s;olemnity. A &s;caffold is rai&s;ed, and the pri&s;oner tied to the &s;take. In&s;tantly he opens his death &s;ong, and prepares for the en&s;uing &s;cene of cruelty with the mo&s;t undaunted courage. On the other &s;ide, they prepare to put it to the utmo&s;t proof, with every torment, which the mind of man ingenious in mi&s;chief can invent. They be|gin at the extremities of his body, and gradu|ally approach the trunk. One plucks out his nails by the roots, one by one; another takes a finger into his mouth, and tears off the fle&s;h with his teeth; a third thru&s;ts the finger, man|gled as it is, into the bole of a pipe made red hot, which he &s;moaks like tobacco. Then they pound his toes and fingers to pieces between two &s;tones; they cut circles about his joints, and ga&s;hes in the fle&s;hy parts of his limbs, which they fear immediately with red-hot irons, cut|ting
<PB N="190" REF="200">
and &s;earing alternately; they pull off this fle&s;h, thus mangled and roa&s;ted, bit by bit, de|vouring it with greedine&s;s, and &s;mearing their faces with the blood, in an enthu&s;ia&s;m of hor|ror and fury. When they have thus torn off the fle&s;h, they twi&s;t the bare nerves and ten|ders about an iron, tearing and &s;napping them; whil&s;t others are employed in pulling and ex|tending the limbs them&s;elves, in every way that can increa&s;e the torment. This conti|nues often five or &s;ix hours together. Then they frequently unbind him to give a breath|ing to their fury, to think what new torments they &s;hall inflict, and to refre&s;h the &s;trength of the &s;ufferer, who wearied out with &s;uch a va|riety of unheard-of torments, often falls imme|diately into &s;o profound a &s;leep, that they are obliged to apply the fire to awaken him, and renew his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>He is again fa&s;tened to the &s;take, and again they renew their cruelty; they &s;tick him all all over with &s;mall matches of a wood that ea&s;ily takes fire, but burns &s;lowly; they con|tinually run &s;harp reeds into every part of his body; they drag out his teeth with pincers, and thru&s;t out his eyes; and la&s;tly, after having burned his fle&s;h from the bones with &s;low fires; after having &s;o mangled the body that it is all but one wound; after having mutilated his face in &s;uch a manner as to carry nothing of human in it; after having peeled
<PB N="191" REF="201">
the &s;kin from the head, and poured a heap of red-hot coals, or boiling water on the naked &s;kull; they once more unbind the wretch, who blind and &s;taggering with pain and weak|ne&s;s, a&s;&s;aulted and pelted upon every &s;ide with clubs and &s;tones, now up, now down, falling into their fires at every &s;tep, runs hither and thither, until &s;ome of the chiefs, whether out of compa&s;&s;ion, or weary of cruelty, puts an end to his life with a club or a dagger. The body is then put into the kettle, and this bar|barous employment is &s;ucceeded by a fea&s;t as barbarous.</P>
<P>The women, forgetting the human as well as the female nature, and transformed into &s;omething wor&s;e than furies, act their parts, and even outdo the men in this &s;cene of horror. The principal per&s;ons of the country &s;it round the &s;take &s;moaking and looking on without the lea&s;t emotion. What is mo&s;t extraordi|nary, the &s;ufferer him&s;elf, in the little intervals of his torments, &s;moaks too, appears uncon|cerned, and conver&s;es with his torturers about indifferent matters. Indeed, during the whole time of his execution, there &s;eems a conte&s;t between him and them which &s;hall exceed, they in inflicting the mo&s;t horrid pains, or he in enduring them with a firmne&s;s and con|&s;tancy almo&s;t above human. Not a groan, not a &s;igh, not a di&s;tortion of countenance e&s;capes him; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his mind entirely in
<PB N="192" REF="202">
the mid&s;t of his torments; he recounts his own exploits, he informs them what cruelties he has inflicted upon their countrymen, and threatens them with the revenge that will at|tend his death; and though his reproaches exa&s;perate them to a perfect madne&s;s of rage and fury, he continues his reproaches even of their ignorance in the art of tormenting, point|ing out him&s;elf more exqui&s;ite methods, and more &s;en&s;ible parts of the body to be afflict|ed. The women have this part of courage as well as the men; and it is as rare for any Indian to behave otherwi&s;e, as it would be for an European to &s;uffer as an Indian.</P>
<P>I do not dwell upon the&s;e circum&s;tances of cruelty, which &s;o degrade human nature, out of choice; but as all who mention the cu&s;toms of this people have in&s;i&s;ted upon their beha|viour in this re&s;pect very particularly, and as it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to give a true idea of their character, I did not chu&s;e to omit it. It &s;erves to &s;hew too, in the &s;tronge&s;t light, to what an inconceiveable degree of barba|rity the pa&s;&s;ions of men let loo&s;e will carry them. It will point out to us the advantages of a religion that teaches a compa&s;&s;ion to our enemies, which is neither known nor practi&s;ed in other religions; and it will make us more &s;en&s;ible than &s;ome appear to be, of the value of commerce, the arts of a civilized life, and the lights of literature; which, if they have abated the force of &s;ome of the natural virtues
<PB N="193" REF="203">
by the luxury which attends them, have taken out likewi&s;e the &s;ting of our natural vices, and &s;oftened the ferocity of the human race without enervating their courage.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the con&s;tancy of the &s;ufferers in this terrible &s;cene &s;hews the won|derful power of an early in&s;titution, and a ferocious thir&s;t of glory, which makes men imitate and exceed what philo&s;ophy, or even religion can effect.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners who have the happine&s;s to plea&s;e tho&s;e to whom they are offered, have a fortune altogether oppo&s;ite to that of tho&s;e who are condemned. They are adopted into the family, they are accepted in the place of the father, &s;on, or hu&s;band that is lo&s;t; and they have no other mark of their cap|tivity, but that they are not &s;uffered to return to their own nation. To attempt this would be certain death. The principal purpo&s;e of the war is to recruit in this manner; for which rea&s;on a general who lo&s;es many of his men, though he &s;hould conquer, is little better than di&s;graced at home; becau&s;e the end of the war was not an&s;wered. They are therefore extremely careful of their men, and never chu&s;e to attack but with a very un|doubted &s;uperiority, either in number or &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The &s;calps which they value &s;o much are the trophies of their bravery; with the&s;e they
<PB N="194" REF="204">
adorn their hou&s;es, which are e&s;teemed in proportion as this &s;ort of &s;poils is more nume|rous. They have &s;olemn days appointed, upon which the young men gain a new name or title of honour from their headmen; and the&s;e titles are given according to the qualities of the per&s;on, and his performances; of which the&s;e &s;calps are the evidence. This is all the reward they receive for the dangers of the war, and the fatigues of many campaigns, &s;evere almo&s;t beyond credit. They think it abun|dantly &s;ufficient to have a name given by their governors; men of merit them&s;elves, and judges of it; a name re&s;pected by their coun|trymen, and terrible to their enemies. There are many other things fit to engage the curio&s;i|ty, and even afford matter of in&s;tructive re|flection, in the manners of this barbarous peo|ple; but the&s;e &s;eem to be the mo&s;t &s;triking, and fitte&s;t to be in&s;i&s;ted on in a work which is to give a general idea of America. The pre|&s;ent &s;ettlements, their commerce and pro|ductions, ought to be allowed their proper room. In which I propo&s;e to treat, fir&s;t of the Spani&s;h colonies, as the fir&s;t di&s;covered and large&s;t object, and that in which the re&s;t of Europe, though excluded, is the mo&s;t con|cerned. The Portugue&s;e as neare&s;t in place and rank, &s;hall be &s;econd. The French &s;hall next be con&s;idered. The Engli&s;h &s;hall be re&s;erved to the la&s;t, as the mo&s;t important to our&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>PART III. SPANISH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING de&s;cribed with as much conci&s;ene&s;s as the &s;ubject would bear, the manners of the original inhabitants of America, as we had before that related the mo&s;t remarkable adventures of it's di&s;coverers and conquerors; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to view more minutely, what and how advantageous a country the&s;e conque&s;ts and di&s;coveries have added to the world; and what are the views, intere&s;ts, and characters of tho&s;e, who at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t part of that exten|&s;ive region.</P>
<P>America extends from the North Pole to the fifty-&s;eventh degree of South latitude; it is upwards of eight thou&s;and miles in length; it &s;ees both hemi&s;pheres; it has two &s;ummers and a double winter; it enjoys all the variety of climates which the earth affords; it is wa&s;hed by the two greate&s;t oceans. To the
<PB N="196" REF="206">
Ea&s;tward it has the Atlantic ocean, which divides it from Europe and Africa. To the We&s;t it has another ocean, the great South-Sea, by which it is disjoined from A&s;ia. By the&s;e &s;eas it may, and does carry on a direct commerce with the other three parts of world. It is compo&s;ed of two va&s;t continents, one on the North, the other upon the South, which are joined by the great kingdom of Mexico, which forms a &s;ort of i&s;thmus fif|teen hundred miles long, and in one part, at Darien, &s;o extremely narrow, as to make the communication between the two oceans by no means difficult. In the great gulph, which is formed between this i&s;thmus and the North|ern and Southern continents, lie an infinite multitude of i&s;lands, many of them large, and mo&s;t of them fertile, and capable of being cultivated to very great advantage.</P>
<P>America in general is not a mountainous country, yet it has the greate&s;t mountains in the world. The Andes, or Cordilleras, run from North to South along the coa&s;t of the Pacific ocean. Though for the mo&s;t part within the torrid zone, they are perpetually covered with &s;now, and in their bowels con|tain inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ures. In the province of St. Martha in South America are likewi&s;e very great mountains, which communicate with the former. In North America we know of none con&s;iderable, but that long
<PB N="197" REF="207">
ridge which lies to the back of our &s;ettle|ments, which we call the Apalachian, or Allegeney mountains; if that may be at all con&s;idered as a mountain, which upon one &s;ide indeed has a very great declivity, but upon the other is nearly on a level with the re&s;t of the country for the greater part.</P>
<P>Without compari&s;on, America is that part of the world which is the be&s;t watered; and that not only for the &s;upport of life, but for the convenience of trade, and the inter|cour&s;e of each part with the others. In North America the great river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi ri&s;ing from unknown &s;ources, runs an immen&s;e cour&s;e from North to South, and receives the va&s;t tribute of the Ohio, the Ouabache, and other immen&s;e rivers, not to be po&s;tponed to the Rhine or the Danube, navigable almo&s;t to their very &s;ources, and laying open the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of this continent. Near the heads of the&s;e are five great lakes, or rather &s;eas of fre&s;h water communicating with each other, and all communicating with the ocean by the river St. Laurence, which pa&s;&s;es through them. The&s;e afford &s;uch an inlet for commerce as mu&s;t produce the greate&s;t advantages, when|ever the country adjacent &s;hall come to be fully inhabited, and by an indu&s;trious and civilized people. The Ea&s;tern &s;ide of North America, which is our portion, be&s;ides the noble rivers Hud&s;on, Delaware, Su&s;quehanna, Patowmack,
<PB N="198" REF="208">
&s;upplies &s;everal others of great depth, length, and commodious navigation. Many parts of our &s;ettlements are &s;o inter&s;ected with navigable rivers and creeks, that the planters may be &s;aid, without exaggera|tion, to have each a harbour at his own door.</P>
<P>South America is, if po&s;&s;ible, in this re|&s;pect, even more fortunate. It &s;upplies much the two large&s;t rivers in the world, the river of Amazons, and the Rio de la Plata. The fir&s;t ri&s;ing in Peru, not far from the South-Sea, pa&s;&s;es from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, almo&s;t quite thro' the continent of South America, navigable for &s;ome &s;ort or other of ve&s;&s;els all the way, and receiving into it's bo&s;om a prodigious number of rivers, all navigable in the &s;ame manner, and &s;o great, that Mon&s;ieur Condamine found it often almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to determine which was the main channel. The Rio de la Plata ri&s;ing in the heart of the country, &s;hapes it's cour&s;e to the South-Ea&s;t, and pours &s;uch an immen&s;e flood into the &s;ea, that it makes it ta&s;te fre&s;h a great many leagues from the &s;hore; to &s;ay nothing of the Oronoquo, which might rank the foremo&s;t among&s;t any but the American rivers. The &s;oil and pro|ducts in &s;uch a variety of climates, cannot &s;atisfactorily be treated of in a general de|&s;cription; we &s;hall in their places con&s;ider them particularly.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="209">All America is in the hands of four na|tions. The Spaniards, who, as they fir&s;t di&s;|covered it, have the large&s;t and riche&s;t &s;hare. All that part of North America, which com|po&s;es the i&s;thmus of Mexico, and what lies beyond that towards the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi on the Ea&s;t, the Pacific ocean to the We&s;t and North-We&s;t, and they po&s;&s;e&s;s all South America, excepting Bra&s;il, which lies between the mouth of the river of Amazons and that of Plata along the Atlantic ocean; this be|longs to Portugal. That part of North America which the Spaniards have not, is divided between the Engli&s;h and French. The Engli&s;h have all the countries which incircle Hud|&s;on's Bay, and thence in a line all along the Ea&s;tern &s;hore to the thirtieth degree of North latitude. France claims the country which lies between this and the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements to the We&s;t, and &s;ecures an intercour&s;e with them by the mouths of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, the Mobile, and of the river St. Laurence, which are the only avenues of navigation to this very exten&s;ive country. The multitude of i&s;lands which lie between the two continents, are divided among&s;t the Spaniards, French, and Engli&s;h. The Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;s three or four &s;mall i&s;lands, which, in any other hands, would be of no con&s;equence. The Danes have one or two, but they hardly de&s;erve to be named among&s;t the proprietors of America.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>THE order which I intend to ob&s;erve in treating of the Spani&s;h colonies is, after having &s;et forth their &s;ituation, their climate, and the nature of their &s;oil, to de|&s;cribe tho&s;e commodities in which they trade; to give a clear and conci&s;e account of their method of manufacturing them; and then to lay open the manner of their dealing in them as well as that by which they carry on their fo|reign commerce. La&s;t of all I &s;hall &s;ay &s;ome|thing of the genius and temper of the inhabi|tants; of &s;uch cu&s;toms of theirs as are remark|able, and of their civil policy, and of their military, &s;o far as they are come to my know|ledge, or as they are worthy the attention of the reader. The exact divi&s;ion of the pro|vinces, the cour&s;es of the rivers, the di&s;tances of places, the exact dimen&s;ions of harbours and their &s;oundings; all the&s;e, as they are infinitely better known from maps and charts, &s;o it would be impertinent and tedious to fill up this &s;hort work with them, which propo&s;es to give, even &s;hort as it is, a de&s;cription of every thing that may tend to a just notion of America; and therefore cannot &s;acrifice matters of more moment to the de&s;cription of things, of which a far better idea may be ac|quired by other means to tho&s;e whom they
<PB N="201" REF="211">
concern; and to tho&s;e whom they do not in|tere&s;t, who are by far the majority, mu&s;t be tedious and unin&s;tructive.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t country which the Spaniards &s;et|tled upon the continent of America was Mexico; and it &s;till continues their principal &s;ettlement, whether we con&s;ider it's number of inhabitants, it's natural wealth, or it's ex|tended traffick. As it lies for the mo&s;t part within the torrid zone, it is exce&s;&s;ively hot; and on the Ea&s;tern coa&s;t, where the land is low, mar&s;hy, and con&s;tantly flooded in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, it is likewi&s;e extremely un|whol&s;ome; neither is that coa&s;t plea&s;ant in any re&s;pect; incumber'd for the mo&s;t part with almo&s;t impenetrable woods of man|grove trees, of a bare and di&s;agreeable a&s;pect, and which extend into the water for a con|&s;iderable way. The inland country a&s;&s;umes a more agreeable a&s;pect, and the air is of a better temperament; here the tropical fruits grow in great abundance; the land is of a good variety, and would not refu&s;e any &s;ort of grain, if the number or indu&s;try of the inha|bitants were any way proportioned to the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil. But on the We&s;tern &s;ide the land is not &s;o low as on the Ea&s;tern, much better in quality, and full of plantations.</P>
<P>It is probable the Spaniards chu&s;e to leave the Ea&s;tern coa&s;t in it's pre&s;ent &s;tate of rude|ne&s;s and de&s;olation, judging that a rugged and

unwhol&s;ome frontier is a better defence a|gain&s;t an European enemy, than fortifications and armies, to be maintained at a va&s;t expence; or than the &s;trength of the inhabitants, made by the climate effeminate and pu&s;illanimous, and kept &s;o by policy: and indeed it would be next to impo&s;&s;ible to make any con&s;ide|rable e&s;tabli&s;hment on that coa&s;t, that could effectually an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of any power in Europe, without &s;truggling with the great|e&s;t difficulties; and as for a &s;udden inva&s;ion, the nature of the country it&s;elf is a good fortification. In general, few countries un|der the &s;ame a&s;pect of the heavens, enjoy more of the benefits of nature, and the nece&s;|&s;aries of life; but, like all the tropical coun|tries, it rather is more abundant in fruits than in grain. Pine apples, pomegranates, oranges, lemons, citrons, figs, and cocoa nuts, are here in the greate&s;t plenty and perfection. Vines and apples require temperate climates.</P>
<P>The number of their horned cattle is in a manner infinite; &s;ome private per&s;ons are &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty thou&s;and head; many are wild, and a very con&s;iderable trade is driven in their hides and tallow, but the extreme heat prevents their turning the fle&s;h to any account in commerce. Swine are equally numerous, and their lard is much in reque&s;t all over this country, where it is u&s;ed in&s;tead of butter. Sheep are numerous

in Mexico, but I do not find that wool is an article of any great con&s;ideration in their trade; nor is it probable that it is of a good kind, as it is &s;carce ever found u&s;eful between the tropicks, where it is hairy and &s;hort, except only in Peru; and that is the produce of &s;heep of a &s;pecies very different from that in the re&s;t of America; as Peru is it&s;elf remarkably diffe|rent in climate from all other countries under the torrid zone. But cotton is here very good, and in great plenty. It is manufactured large|ly, for as it is a light wear, &s;uitable to the climate, and all other cloathing being extrava|gantly dear, it is the general wear of the inha|bitants; the woollens and linens of Europe being rather luxuries, and worn only by per|&s;ons of &s;ome condition. Some provinces produce &s;ilk, but not in that abundance or perfection to make a remarkable part of their export; not but that the country is very fit for that, and many other things valuable, which are but little cultivated; for the gold and &s;ilver, which makes the glory of this country, and in the abundant trea&s;ures of which it exceeds all the world, engages almo&s;t the whole at|tention of the inhabitants, as it is almo&s;t the only thing for which the Spaniards value their colonies, and what alone receives the en|couragement of the court; therefore I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t mo&s;t largely upon the&s;e articles.

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not known with certainty, whether all, or &s;ome provinces only of New Spain, produce mines of gold and &s;ilver. It is, how|ever, allowed that the chief mines of gold are in Veragua and New Granada, confining upon Darien and Terra Firma. Tho&s;e of &s;ilver, which are much more rich as well as numerous, are found in &s;everal parts, but in none &s;o much as in the province of Mexico. But all the mines, whether of gold or &s;ilver, are always found in the mountainous and bar|ren parts; nature often making amends one way for her failures in another.</P>
<P>Gold is found either in the &s;and of rivers, native, and in &s;mall grains, or it is dug out of
<PB N="250" REF="215">
the earth in the &s;ame condition in &s;mall bits, almo&s;t wholly metallic, and of a tolerable purity; or it is found like the ore of other metals in an aggregate opaque ma&s;s, in a mixture of earth, &s;tone &s;ulphur, and other metals. In this &s;tate it is of all colours, red, white, blacki&s;h, and making little or no o&s;tentation of the riches it contains. Some|times it forms part of the ornament of &s;ome beautiful &s;tones, which are of various lively colours, inter&s;ected with filaments of this metal, quite native. Lapis lazuli is one of the&s;e, which has always &s;ome &s;mall portions of gold; but this golden &s;treaking is often ex|tremely fallacious, and has betrayed many in|to ruinous expences, for in &s;everal &s;tones the&s;e fine veins have been nothing more than marca&s;ite, but &s;uch marca&s;ites or fire-&s;tones are found in mines, which contain real gold. But gold, how&s;oever found, whether native, or in what is called the ore, is &s;eldom or never without a mixture of other metals, generally &s;ilver or copper.</P>
<P>The gold mines, though they contain the riche&s;t of all metals, it is remarkable mo&s;t fre|quently di&s;appoint the hopes, and ruin the for|tunes of tho&s;e who engage in them; tho' neither the labouring of the mine, nor the purifying the metal, is attended with &s;uch an expence as what tho&s;e are obliged to, who work mines of the in|ferior metals. For the vein is, of all others, the
<PB N="206" REF="216">
mo&s;t unequal; &s;ometimes very large, full, and rich; then it often decays by a quick gradation, and is &s;ometimes &s;uddenly lo&s;t. But the ends of the veins are, on the other hand, often ex|tremely rich; they are called the pur&s;e of the vein; and when the miner is &s;o happy as to light on one of the&s;e pur&s;es, his fortune is made immediately.</P>
<P>When the ore is dug out, the mo&s;t u&s;ual method is to break it to pieces in a mill, ex|actly re&s;embling tho&s;e large ones we u&s;e for grinding apples, wherein a mill-&s;tone &s;et on end is made to turn in a circular channel of &s;tone. When the ore is thus broke, and the gold &s;omewhat &s;eparated from the im|pure ma&s;s, they add to the whole a quantity of quick&s;ilver. Quick&s;ilver has, of all other bodies, the greate&s;t attraction with gold, which therefore immediately breaks the links which held it to the former earth, and clings clo&s;e to this congenial &s;ub&s;tance. Then a rapid &s;tream of water is let into the channel, which &s;cour|ing away (through a hole made for the pur|po&s;e) the lighter earth, by the bri&s;kne&s;s of it's current, leaves the gold and mercury precipitated by it's weight at the bottom. This amalgama, or pa&s;te, is put into a linen cloth, and &s;queezed &s;o as to make the quick|&s;ilver &s;eparate and run out. To compleat this &s;eparation, it is nece&s;&s;ary to fu&s;e the metal, and then all the mercury flies off in fumes.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="217">But in many parts of Spani&s;h America, ano|ther way of getting and purifying gold is practi&s;ed. When by &s;ure tokens they know that gold lies in the bed of a rivulet, they turn the current into the inward angles, which time and the &s;tream have formed; whil&s;t this runs, they dig and turn up the earth to make it the more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved and carried off. When the &s;urface is thus compleatly wa&s;hed away, and they are come to a &s;ort of &s;tiff earth, which is the receptacle of gold, they return the &s;tream into it's former chan|nel, and dig up the earth as they find it, which they carry to a little ba&s;on &s;omewhat in the form of a &s;mith's bellows. Into this they turn a &s;mall but lively &s;tream to carry off the foreign matter, whil&s;t they facilitate the ope|ration by &s;tirring the ma&s;s with an iron hook, which di&s;&s;olves the earth, and gathers up the &s;tones, which are carefully thrown out that they may not interrupt the pa&s;&s;ages that carry off the earth. By this means the gold loo&s;ened from the gro&s;s matter, which adhered to it, falls to the bottom, but mixed &s;o inti|mately with a black heavy &s;and, that none of the gold can be perceived, unle&s;s it happens to be a pretty large grain. To &s;eparate it from this &s;and, it is put into a &s;ort of wooden plat|ter, with a little hollow of about the depth of half an inch at bottom. This platter they fill with water, and turning the ma&s;s about bri&s;kly
<PB N="208" REF="218">
with their hands for &s;ome time, the &s;and pa&s;&s;es over the edges, and leaves the gold in &s;mall grains, pure, and of it's genuine colour, in the hollow at the bottom. Thus is gold refined without fire or mercury, merely by wa&s;hing. The places where this is performed are called therefore Lavaderos by the Spa|niards. There are many more methods of extracting and purifying this precious metal, but the&s;e are the mo&s;t common ways u&s;ed by Spaniards in their Indies.</P>
<P>Silver is the metal next in rank, but fir&s;t in con&s;equence in the Spani&s;h traffick, as their mines yield a much greater quantity of the latter than of the former. It is found in the earth under different forms, as indeed the ore of all metals is. Such is the diver&s;ity of ores in this re&s;pect, that nothing but a long experience in this particular branch can exactly a&s;certain the &s;pecies of the metal, which almo&s;t any ore contains at fir&s;t view. I have &s;een &s;pecimens wherein the &s;ilver, almo&s;t pure, twined it&s;elf about a white &s;tone, penetrating into the in|ter&s;tices in the &s;ame manner that the roots of trees enter into the rocks, and twi&s;t them&s;elves about them. Some are of an a&s;h-coloured ap|pearance, others &s;potted of a red and blue, &s;ome of changeable colours, and many almo&s;t black, affecting &s;omewhat of a pointed regular form like cry&s;tals. I cannot find that it is ever found in grains or &s;and, native, as gold is.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="219">The manner of refining &s;ilver does not differ e&s;&s;entially from the proce&s;s which is employed for gold. They are both purified upon the &s;ame principle; by clearing away as much of the earth as can be, with water; by uniting, or amalgamating it with mercury; and afterwards by clearing off the mercury it|&s;elf, by &s;training and evaporation. But the management of &s;ilver in this re&s;pect is much more difficult than that of gold; becau&s;e this metal is much more intimately united with the foreign matters with which it is found in the mine; and it's attraction with mercury is much weaker; therefore there is great care taken in the amalgamation, and it is a long time before they are perfectly mixed. A quantity of &s;ea-&s;alt is likewi&s;e added. No &s;ilver is had by mere wa&s;hing.</P>
<P>The chymi&s;ts have talked very freely of the production of the&s;e and other metals in the earth; of the &s;alt, &s;ulphur, and mercury that compo&s;e them, and the manner in which the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are united and changed &s;o as to form metals and minerals of every &s;pecies. Some have recour&s;e to the &s;un as the great agent in this proce&s;s, e&s;pecially in gold and &s;ilver, as the mo&s;t worthy &s;uch an operator. Others call in the aid of &s;ubterraneous fires and central heat, but in reality they have ad|vanced very little that is &s;atisfactory upon this &s;ubject. They have never by any method
<PB N="210" REF="220">
of joining the matters, which they have a&s;|&s;igned as the con&s;tituent parts of metals, in any proportions what&s;oever, nor by any de|grees of their great agent fire, been able to make metal of that which was not metal before. Neither have they found what they allot as the component parts of all metals in &s;uch a manner in all, as to enable them to fix any common principle for their generation. Some they cannot analy&s;e by any art, as gold; they indeed define it a compo&s;ition of a very &s;ubtile mercury, and a &s;ulphur as &s;ub|tile.</P>
<P>But how this comes to be known, when no proce&s;s hitherto di&s;covered, has been able to extract either of the&s;e from gold, they who have advanced &s;uch things ought to tell. It is rea&s;onable to believe, that there is &s;ome pla&s;tic principle in nature, perhaps &s;omething analagous to the &s;eminal principle in plants and animals, whatever that is, which does not, as we know, re&s;emble any known body, nor is compo&s;ed of any com|bination of known bodies; but powerful of it&s;elf to combine and vary &s;uch a part of the common &s;tock of matter as it is fitted to operate upon, which it draws to it&s;elf, and cau&s;es to form an animal, or a plant, or a mineral, or metal, of this or that nature, ac|cording to the original nature of the &s;eed. Suppo&s;e a plant &s;ubjected to all the torture of
<PB N="211" REF="221">
the chymical que&s;tion: you find it contains various matters; an earth, water, oil, &s;alt, &s;pirit, and in the three la&s;t perhaps &s;ome|thing &s;pecific, and differing from other plants. But neither the &s;ame quantities of &s;imilar matter, nor the&s;e very matters them&s;elves, can ever come to form a plant like the original, or any thing like a plant at all, becau&s;e the &s;eminal virtue is wanting, nor is it perhaps di&s;coverable. And as for the other matters, they are the inert parts of the plant; with|out power them&s;elves, they are the materials with which, and on which the &s;eminal virtue acts, to organize the ma&s;s, to &s;pread the bran|ches, to &s;hoot out the gems, to mature the fruit, and in &s;hort to perform all the func|tions of a complete plant. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of animals. And why not of minerals, though of a le&s;s nice organization? Why &s;hould they not have the &s;eminal principle too, which operating by it's own power, and in a way of it's own, upon the elements of air, earth, water, oil, and &s;alt, is capable of pro|ducing iron, copper, gold, &s;ilver, and other metals The want of this will always hinder us from being able to produce any metal from other than metalline ingredients, though we &s;hould take &s;uch things as re|&s;emble the ingredients they yield upon an analy&s;is, and in the &s;ame quantities in which we find them. This I do not &s;ay as favouring
<PB N="212" REF="222">
the notion that &s;tones and metals vegetate ex|actly like plants. That the&s;e are often found where they had formerly been exhau&s;ted, and that they are known to extend their dimen|&s;ions, is pretty certain; but that they a&s;&s;imi|late the heterogeneous matter which increa&s;es their bulk, in a manner analagous to plants, I cannot venture to propo&s;e. It mu&s;t be al|lowed that &s;ilver has been found, and I have &s;o &s;een it, extending it&s;elf among the inter|&s;tices of &s;tones, not unlike ivy and other para|&s;ite plants; yet as a metal no way differing from it, or at all inferior, is extracted from ores, which have an appearance altogether different, and which too is the u&s;ual way, it is probable the manner in which they grow is not the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What I had to &s;ay of gold and &s;ilver, as both are had, and the latter in va&s;t quantities, in Mexico, I thought it proper, for the &s;ake of avoiding repetitions, to bring them under that head, though all the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h territories produce largely of both.</P>
<P>Of the plenty of gold and &s;ilver, which the mines of Mexico afford, great things have been &s;aid, and with ju&s;tice; as this, with the other Spani&s;h colonies in America, in a manner furni&s;h the whole world with &s;ilver; and bear a great proportion in gold to the whole of what the world produces. A late very judicious collector of voyages &s;ays, that
<PB N="213" REF="223">
the revenues of Mexico can hardly fall &s;hort of twenty-four millions of our money. He founds this upon a return made by the bi&s;hops of their tenths, which, without doubt, were not over-rated; and that the&s;e amounted to one million and a half &s;terling; that the&s;e are about a fourth of the revenues of the clergy; and that the e&s;tates of the clergy are about the fourth part of the whole revenues of the kingdom, which at this rate amount to twenty-four millions Engli&s;h. He takes ano|ther method of computing the wealth of this province, which is, by the fifth paid to the king of the gold and &s;ilver dug out of their mines. This he ob&s;erves in the year 1730 amounted to one million of marks in &s;ilver, each mark equivalent to eight ounces; &s;o that if we compute this &s;ilver at five &s;hillings per ounce, then the inhabitants receive from their mines ten millions in money. For my part, I neither di&s;tru&s;t the candor or good &s;en&s;e of this writer; but I can hardly avoid thinking he mu&s;t be mi&s;informed in the accounts upon which he has built his calcula|tion. If New Spain draws from her &s;ilver and gold mines ten millions annually; Peru, even &s;ince the decline of the mines of Poto&s;i, has &s;carce ever been thought le&s;s rich in &s;ilver than Mexico, and mu&s;t therefore be rated at the &s;ame proportion, and allowed to yield ten millions more annually. New Mexico
<PB N="214" REF="224">
abounds likewi&s;e in very rich &s;ilver mines; but that we may not exceed, we will allow for this province but two millions, which, allowing for the large produce of New Spain, is certainly not above the proportion. Chili has, indeed, no con&s;iderable mines of &s;ilver, but then tho&s;e of gold are by far the riche&s;t in the world; and taking the comparative wealth of this province with the others, it cannot be le&s;s than two millions, if we add to it what is pro|duced in Terra Firma; &s;o that the gold and &s;ilver rai&s;ed in the Spani&s;h colonies cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than twenty-four millions yearly. Uztariz, in his celebrated di&s;cour&s;e on the Spani&s;h commerce, an author who was undoubtedly well informed, and in an argument where it an&s;wered his purpo&s;e to make the mo&s;t of this importation, does not allow that more than fifteen millions of dollars are brought into Spain annually in gold and &s;ilver. This is con&s;iderably le&s;s than four millions &s;terling; but becau&s;e we ought to allow for concealments, which to be &s;ure are con&s;iderable, we will &s;tate it at four mil|lions. The Acapulco trade, we will admit, carries off one million more, though this is rather over. There is another vent too, the contraband trade with the Engli&s;h, French, and Dutch, which draws away largely; but I &s;uppo&s;e two millions will be thought largely allowed. Now the whole of this does not
<PB N="215" REF="225">
exceed &s;even millions annually carried out of the country; and there remains a clear &s;um of &s;eventeen millions, after all deductions. If this be the ca&s;e, mu&s;t not the wealth of Spani&s;h America in a little time accumulate to a degree far exceeding the bounds of all proba|bility? Since 1730, when this ob&s;ervation was made, twenty-&s;ix years are now pa&s;&s;ed, and we have no rea&s;on to believe the mines are at all exhau&s;ted in that time; and if in any year &s;ince 1724, when Uztariz wrote, more plate has pa&s;&s;ed into Europe than was brought at that time, it is rea&s;onable to believe it is becau&s;e the mines have produced more largely. Now if we multiply the annual &s;um remaining, coined and uncoined in Spani&s;h America, which is &s;eventeen millions, by twenty-&s;ix, the number of years &s;ince the calculation was made, it will produce four hundred and forty-two millions, accumulated in twenty-&s;ix years. But looking a little backward at this rate of annual &s;aving, &s;ee what the produce mu&s;t have been &s;ince the beginning of the la&s;t century, when the mines yielded as plentifully as they do now, in general, and &s;ome much more plentifully. It mu&s;t be from the year 1600 to this day, not le&s;s than two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-two millions Engli&s;h money, ama&s;|&s;ed and hoarded up within the Spani&s;h colo|nies; be&s;ides the &s;avings of the foregoing century, which mu&s;t be far from incon&s;ide|rable.
<PB N="216" REF="226">
Make almo&s;t any abatements in this; allow that the churches are enriched to a degree of profu&s;ene&s;s, as they are; allow that the private hou&s;es have the meane&s;t uten&s;ils of gold and &s;ilver, as it is &s;aid in &s;ome places they have; allow for the wear, which even in the&s;e metals is not little; allow all this; and yet after all, it mu&s;t very far exceed belief, that any riches like the&s;e, or bearing any proportion to the&s;e, are to be found in Spani&s;h America, where the majority of the people are &s;laves, or Indians in a &s;tate next to &s;lavery, and even where the Spaniards have comparatively but few rich among&s;t them, mo&s;t who make their fortunes ha&s;tening to Europe to enjoy them. After all, we have, I fear, no certain way of e&s;timating the im|men&s;e trea&s;ures, of which this country is an inexhau&s;tible fountain; great they are un|doubtedly, though by no means &s;o great as is repre&s;ented.</P>

<P>COCHINEAL, the next commodity for value which they export, is u&s;ed in dying all the &s;everal kinds of the fine&s;t &s;carlet, crim&s;on, and purple. After much di&s;pute about the nature of this curious drug, it &s;eems at la&s;t agreed, that it is of the animal kind; an in&s;ect of the &s;pecies of the gall in&s;ects. This animal is found adhering to various plants, but there is only one which communicates to it the qualities which make it valuable in medicine and manufactures. This plant is called opuntia by the botani&s;ts. It con&s;i&s;ts wholly of thick &s;ucculent oval leaves, joined end to end, and &s;preading out on the &s;ides in various ramifications. The flower is large, and the fruit in &s;hape re&s;embling a fig; this is full of a crim&s;on juice, and to this juice it is that the cochineal in&s;ect owes it's colour.</P>
<P>When the rainy &s;ea&s;ons come on, they who cultivate this plant, cut off tho&s;e heads which abound mo&s;t with &s;uch in&s;ects, as are not yet at their full growth; and pre&s;erve them very carefully from the weather and all other injuries. The&s;e branches, though &s;epa|rated from their parent &s;tocks, pre&s;erve their fre&s;hne&s;s and juices a long time; and this en|ables the in&s;ect not only to live out the rains, but to grow to its full &s;ize, and be in readine&s;s
<PB N="218" REF="228">
to bring forth it's young, as &s;oon as the incle|mency of the &s;ea&s;on is over. When this time comes on, they are brought out, and placed upon the proper plants, di&s;po&s;ed in little ne&s;ts of &s;ome mo&s;&s;y &s;ub&s;tance. As &s;oon as they feel the enlivening influence of the fre&s;h air, they bring forth in three or four days from their expo&s;ure at farthe&s;t. The young &s;carce bigger than a mite, runs about with a won|derful celerity, and the whole plantation is immediately peopled; yet what is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, this animal, &s;o lively in it's infancy, quickly lo&s;es all it's activity, and attaching it|&s;elf to &s;ome of the lea&s;t expo&s;ed, and mo&s;t &s;ucculent part of the leaf, it clings there for life, without ever moving, not wounding the leaf for it's &s;u&s;tenance, but &s;ucking with a probo&s;cis, with which it is furni&s;hed for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>What is not le&s;s remarkable than the way of life of this animal, is the nature of the male, which has no appearance of belonging to the &s;ame &s;pecies; far from being fixed to a &s;pot, he has wings, and is, like the butterfly, continually in motion; they are &s;maller than the cochineal, and con&s;tantly &s;een among&s;t them, and walking over them without being &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who take care of the in&s;ect, of being a creature of the &s;ame kind, though they believe that the cochineals are impreg|nated
<PB N="219" REF="229">
by them. But it is the female cochi|neal only which is gathered for u&s;e.</P>
<P>They make four gatherings a year, which are &s;o many generations of this animal. When they are &s;ufficiently careful, they bru&s;h off the in&s;ects one by one with a &s;ort of hair pencils, and take them as they fall; but they often bru&s;h the whole plant in a carele&s;s manner, &s;o that fragments of it are mixed with the cochi|neals, and them&s;elves mixed, the old and young together, which carele&s;sne&s;s abates much of the value; but what chiefly makes the good|ne&s;s of this commodity, is the manner of killing and drying the cochineals, which is performed three ways; the fir&s;t is by dipping the ba&s;ket in which it is gathered into boiling water, and afterwards drying them in the &s;un, this the Spaniards call renegrida. The &s;econd method is by drying them in ovens made for the purpo&s;e; this, from it's grey colour, veined with purple, is called ja&s;peade. The third manner is, when the Indians dry them on their cakes of maize, which are baked upon flat &s;tones; this la&s;t is the wor&s;t kind, as it is generally overbaked, and &s;omething burned. They call it negra.</P>

<P>The cocao, or cacao of which chocolate is made, is a con&s;iderable article in the natu|ral hi&s;tory and commerce of New Spain. It grows upon a tree of a middling &s;ize; the wood is &s;pungy and porous, the bark &s;mooth, and of a cinamon colour: the flower grows in bunches between the &s;talk and the wood, of the form of ro&s;es, but &s;mall, and without any &s;cent. The fruit is a &s;ort of pod, which contains the cacao, much about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a cucumber. Within there is a pulp of a mo&s;t refre&s;hing acid ta&s;te, which fills up the inter&s;tices between the nuts be|fore they are ripe; but when they fully ripen, the&s;e nuts are packed up wonderfully clo&s;e, and in a mo&s;t regular and elegant order; they have a pretty tough &s;hell, and within is
<PB N="221" REF="231">
the oily rich &s;ub&s;tance, of which chocolate is made. This fruit grows differently from our European fruits, which always hang upon the &s;mall branches; but this grows along the body of the great ones, principally at the joints. None are found upon the &s;mall, which, though it is a manner of vegetation unknown here, prevails in &s;everal other plants within the tropicks. This cacao is a very tender tree, equally impatient of the wind, heat or cold, and will flouri&s;h only in the &s;hade; for which rea&s;on in the cacao walks, they always plant a palm-tree for every one of cacao. I need &s;ay little of the u&s;e of this fruit; it is general among&s;t our&s;elves, and it's virtues well known; but however great the external call for it may be, the internal con|&s;umption is much greater; &s;o that in Mexico and Terra Firma, in &s;ome provinces of which latter it is found in the greate&s;t perfection, their foreign and dome&s;tic commerce in this article is immen&s;e, and the profits &s;o great, that a &s;mall garden of the cacaos is &s;aid to produce twenty thou&s;and crowns a year. Tho' I believe this to be exaggerated, it &s;hews, however, in what a light of profit this como|dity is con&s;idered. At home it makes the principal part of their diet, and is found whol|&s;ome, nutritious, and &s;uitable to the climate. This fruit is often confounded with the cocoa nut, which is a &s;pecies wholly different.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>THE trade of Mexico may be con&s;idered as con&s;i&s;ting of three great branches, by which it communicates with the whole world; the trade with Europe by La Vera Cruz; the trade with the Ea&s;t-Indies by Aca|pulco; and the commerce of the South-Sea by the &s;ame port. The places in New Spain, which can intere&s;t a &s;tranger, are there|fore three only, La Vera Cruz, Acapulco, and Mexico.</P>
<P>Mexico, the capital of the kingdom, the re&s;idence of the viceroy, the &s;eat of the fir&s;t audience or chamber of ju&s;tice, and an arch|bi&s;hopric, is certainly one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t &s;plendid cities, not only in America, but in the whole world. Though no &s;ea-port town, nor communicating with the &s;ea by any navigable river, it has a prodigious com|merce, and is it&s;elf the center of all that is carried on between America and Europe on one hand, and between America and the Ea&s;t-Indies on the other; for here the prin|cipal merchants re&s;ide, the greate&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is negociated, and the goods that pa&s;s from Acapulco to La Vera Cruz, or from La Vera Cruz to Acapulco, for the u&s;e of the Philippines, and in a great mea&s;ure for the u&s;e of Peru and Lima, all pa&s;s through this
<PB N="223" REF="233">
city, and employ an incredible number of hor&s;es and mules in the carriage. Hither all the gold and &s;ilver comes to be coined, here the king's fifth is depo&s;ited, and here is wrought all that immen&s;e quantity of uten&s;ils and ornaments in plate, which is every year &s;ent into Europe. Every thing here has the greate&s;t air of magnificence and wealth; the &s;hops glitter upon all &s;ides with the expo&s;ure of gold, &s;ilver, and jewels, and &s;urprize yet more by the work of the imagination upon the trea&s;ures which fill great che&s;ts piled up to the ceilings, whil&s;t they wait the time of being &s;ent to Old Spain. It is &s;aid that the negro wenches, who run by the coaches of the ladies there, wear bracelets of gold, pearl necklaces, and jewels in their ears, whil&s;t the black foot-boys are all over covered with lace and embroidery. It cannot exactly be a&s;certained what number of people are in this city. It is certainly very con&s;iderable, by many not made le&s;s than &s;eventy or eighty thou&s;and. This city it&s;elf is well and regu|larly built, though the hou&s;es are not lofty; the mona&s;teries are numerous, and richly en|dowed, and the churches extravagantly rich in their ornaments, though comparatively poor in the ta&s;te of their architecture.</P>
<P>The port neare&s;t to this city is Acapulco, upon the South-Sea, upwards of two hundred miles di&s;tant from the capital. Acapulco it|&s;elf
<PB N="224" REF="234">
has one of the deepe&s;t, &s;ecure&s;t, and mo&s;t commodious harbours in the South-Sea, and indeed almo&s;t the only one which is good upon the We&s;tern coa&s;t of New Spain. The entrance of the harbour is defended by a ca&s;tle of tolerable &s;trength; the town it&s;elf is but ill built, and makes every way a mi&s;erable figure, except at the time of the fairs, when it intirely changes it's appearance, and becomes one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable marts in the world. About the month of December, the great galleon, which makes the whole communica|tion that is between America and the Philip|pines, after a voyage of five months, and &s;ail|ing three thou&s;and leagues without &s;eeing any other land than the little Ladrones, arrives here loaded with all the rich commodities of the Ea&s;t; cloves, pepper, cinnamon, nut|megs, mace, china, japan wares, callicoes plain and painted, chints, mu&s;lins of every &s;ort, &s;ilks, precious &s;tones, rich drugs, and gold du&s;t. At the &s;ame time the annual &s;hip from Lima comes in, and is not com|puted to bring le&s;s than two millions of pieces of eight in &s;ilver, be&s;ides quick&s;ilver, cacao, drugs, and other valuable commodities, to be laid out in the purcha&s;e of the commodities of the East-Indies. Several other &s;hips from different parts of Chili and Peru meet upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion; and be&s;ides the traffic for the Philippine commodities, this cau&s;es a
<PB N="225" REF="235">
very large dealing for every thing tho&s;e coun|tries have to exchange with one another, as well as for the purcha&s;e of all &s;orts of Euro|pean goods. The fair la&s;ts &s;ometimes for thirty days. As &s;oon as the goods are di&s;po&s;ed of, the galleon prepares to &s;et out on her voyage to the Philippines with her returns, chiefly in &s;ilver, but with &s;ome European goods too, and &s;ome other commodities of America. I &s;peak here, as though there were but one ve&s;&s;el on the trade with the Philippines; and in fact there is only nominally one trading ve&s;&s;el, the galleon it&s;elf, of about twelve hundred tuns; but another attends her commonly as a &s;ort of convoy, which generally carries &s;uch a quantity of goods as pretty much di&s;ables her from performing that office. The galleon has often above a thou&s;and people on board, ei|ther intere&s;ted in the cargo, or merely pa&s;&s;en|gers; and there is no trade in which &s;o large profits are made; the captain of the ve&s;&s;el, the pilots, their mates, and even the common &s;ailors, making in one voyage, what in their &s;everal ranks may be con&s;idered as ea&s;y for|tunes. It is &s;aid by the writer of lord An&s;on's voyage, that the je&s;uits have the profits of this &s;hip to &s;upport their mi&s;&s;ions; and if &s;o, their gains mu&s;t be extremely great, and mu&s;t add much to the con&s;equence of a &s;ociety which has as great a reputation for it's riches as it's wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="236">This commerce to &s;o va&s;t a value, though carried on directly between the king of Spain's own dominions, enriches them in pro|portion but very little; the far greater part of every thing that comes from the Philippines, being the produce, or the fabric of other countries; the Spaniards add none of the arti|ficial value of labour to any thing. The Chi|ne&s;e are largely intere&s;ted in this cargo, and it is to them they are indebted for the manu|facturing &s;uch of their plate, as is wrought into any better fa&s;hion than rude ingots, or inelegant coins. When this fair is over, the town is comparatively de&s;erted; however, it remains for the whole year the mo&s;t con&s;iderable port in Mexico for the trade with Peru and Chili, which is not very great. The East-India goods brought here are carried on mules to Mexico, from whence what exceeds their own con&s;umption is &s;ent by land carriage to La Vera Cruz, to pa&s;s over to Terra Firma, to the i&s;lands, and &s;ome even to Old Spain, though in no great quantity.</P>
<P>From the port of La Vera Cruz it is that the great wealth of Mexico is poured out upon all the old world; and it is from this port alone, that they receive the numberle&s;s luxuries and nece&s;&s;aries that the old world yields them in return. To this port the an|nual fleet from Cadiz, called the flota, arrives about the latter end of November,
<PB N="227" REF="237">
after a pa&s;&s;age of nine weeks. This fleet, which &s;ails only from Cadiz, con&s;i&s;ts of about three men of war as a convoy, and fourteen or fifteen large merchant &s;hips, from four hundred to one thou&s;and tuns burthen. They are loaded almo&s;t with every &s;ort of goods which Europe produces for export; all &s;orts of woollens, linens, &s;ilks, velvets, laces, gla&s;s, paper, cutlery, all &s;orts of wrought iron, watches, clocks, quick&s;ilver, hor&s;e furni|ture, &s;hoes, &s;tockings, books, pictures, military &s;tores, wines and fruits, &s;o that all the trading parts of Europe are highly intere&s;ted in the cargo of this fleet. Spain it&s;elf &s;ends out little more than the wine and fruit. This, with the freight and commi&s;&s;ions to the merchant, and the duty to the king, is almo&s;t all the advan|vantage which that kingdom derives from her commerce with the Indies. It is &s;trictly pro|hibited to load any commodities on board this fleet without entering the goods, the value, and the owner's name, in the India hou&s;e at Seville; and when they return, they mu&s;t bring a certificate from the proper officer there, that the goods were duly landed, and in the proper port. They are not per|mitted to break bulk upon any account until they arrive at La Vera Cruz, nor are they &s;uffered to take in any other than Spani&s;h pa&s;&s;engers, nor them without a licence fir&s;t obtained at the India hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="238">Jealou&s;y is the glaring character of the court of Spain, in whatever regards their American empire; and they often &s;acrifice the pro&s;perity to an exce&s;&s;ive regard to the &s;e|curity of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. They attend in this trade principally to two objects; the exclu&s;ion of all &s;trangers from any &s;hare in it, and the keeping up the market for &s;uch goods as they &s;end; and they think both the&s;e ends be&s;t an&s;wered by &s;ending out only one annual fleet, and that from one only port in Spain, and to one port only in Mexico. The&s;e views, which would be impolitic in any power in Europe be&s;ides, are judicious enough in Spain; becau&s;e the goods they &s;end belonging mo&s;tly to &s;trangers, and the profits upon the &s;ale in the Indies being the only thing that really accrues to them&s;elves, it is certainly right to con&s;ult primarily how they &s;hall get the greate&s;t returns upon the &s;malle&s;t quantity of goods. It would be quite otherwi&s;e, if all, or mo&s;t of what they &s;end abroad, were their own produce or manu|facture. They are undoubtedly right too in keeping the trade very carefully to them&s;elves, though perhaps the means taken to attain this end, will not be thought &s;o rational. By &s;uffering all the trade to be carried on only between two ports, they di&s;courage in the old world all their towns from that emu|lation, which would not only enable them to
<PB N="229" REF="239">
traffic in foreign commodities, but in time to &s;et up fabrics of their own; whereas now, with regard to the export of their commodi|ties, they &s;tand upon the level of &s;trangers; they cannot carry their produce directly to the be&s;t market; and it is very certain, that even trifling di&s;couragements operate very powerfully where the commercial &s;pirit is weak, and the trade in it's infancy. Again; in the new world, this confinement of the trade encourages interlopers, and an illicit commerce, too gainful for any regulations to prevent, and which may afford &s;uch bribes as will di&s;arm the mo&s;t rigid ju&s;tice, and lull the mo&s;t attentive vigilance. So that in reality it may greatly be doubted, whether the pre|cautions, &s;o &s;y&s;tematically pur&s;ued, and im|proved from time to time with &s;o much care and fore&s;ight, are at bottom of mo&s;t advantage or prejudice to that nation. It was probably &s;ome con&s;ideration of this kind, that fir&s;t gave ri&s;e to the cu&s;tom of regi&s;ter &s;hips: it was found that this confined commerce &s;upplied it's exten&s;ive object very imperfectly; and that tho&s;e who were at watch to pour in counterband goods, would take advantage of this want of a regular &s;upply from Spain. When therefore a company of merchants of Cadiz or Seville, judge that goods mu&s;t be wanting at any certain port in the West-Indies, the cour&s;e is, to petition the council
<PB N="230" REF="240">
of the Indies for licence to &s;end a &s;hip of three hundred tuns, or under, to that port. They pay for this licence forty or fifty thou&s;and dollars, be&s;ides pre&s;ents to the officers, in propor|tion to the connivance nece&s;&s;ary to their de|&s;ign; for though the licence runs to three hundred tuns at the utmo&s;t, the ve&s;&s;el fitted out is &s;eldom really le&s;s than &s;ix hundred. This &s;hip and cargo is regi&s;tered at the pretended burthen. It is required too, that a certificate be brought from the king's officer at the port to which the regi&s;ter &s;hip is bound, that &s;he does not exceed the &s;ize at which &s;he is regi&s;tered; all this pa&s;&s;es of cour&s;e; the&s;e are what they call regi&s;ter &s;hips, and by the&s;e the trade of Spani&s;h America has been carried on principally for &s;ome years pa&s;t, &s;ome think as much to the prejudice of their trade, as contrary to all their former maxims in carry|ing it on. But to return to the flota.</P>
<P>When all the goods are landed, and di&s;|po&s;ed of at La Vera Cruz, the fleet takes in the plate, precious &s;tones, cochineal, indi|go, cacao, tobacco, &s;ugar, and hides, which are their returns for Old Spain. Sometimes in May, but more frequently in Augu&s;t, they are ready to depart. From La Vera Cruz they &s;ail to the Havanna in the i&s;le of Cuba, which is the place of rendezvous where they meet the galleons; another fleet which carries on all the trade of Terra Firma by Cartha|gena,
<PB N="231" REF="241">
and of Peru by Panama and Portobello, in the &s;ame manner that the flota &s;erves for that of New Spain. When they arrive at this port, and join the galleons and the regi&s;ter &s;hips that collect at the &s;ame port from all quarters, &s;ome of the cleane&s;t and be&s;t &s;ailing of their ve&s;&s;els are di&s;patched to Spain, with advice of the contents of the&s;e &s;everal fleets, as well as with trea&s;ure and goods of their own, that the court may judge what indulto or duty is proper to be laid on them, and what convoy is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;afety. The&s;e fleets generally make &s;ome &s;tay at the Havan|na before all the &s;hips that compo&s;e them are collected and ready to &s;ail. As &s;oon as this happens they quit the Havanna, and beat through the gulph of Florida, and pa&s;&s;ing between the Bahama i&s;lands, they hold their cour&s;e to the North-Ea&s;t, until they come to the height of St. Augu&s;tin, and then &s;teer away to Old Spain. When the flota has left La Vera Cruz, it has no longer the appearance of a place of con&s;equence; it is a town in a very unhealthy &s;ituation, inha|bited &s;carcely by any but Indians, Meztezes, or negroes. All the merchants of any con&s;e|quence re&s;ide at &s;ome di&s;tance, at a place called Los Angelos. This town may contain about three thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>

<P>THE inhabitants of New Spain are compo&s;ed of people of three different races; whites, Indians, and negroes, or the &s;everal mixtures of tho&s;e. The whites are either born in Old Spain, or they are Creoles; tho&s;e who are native Spaniards are mo&s;tly in offices, or in trade, and have the &s;ame cha|racter and manners with the Spaniards of Europe; the &s;ame gravity of behaviour, the &s;ame natural &s;agacity and good &s;en&s;e, the &s;ame indolence, and a yet greater &s;hare of pride and &s;tateline&s;s; for here they look upon the being natives of Old Spain as a very honourable di&s;tinction, and are in return looked upon by the Creoles with no &s;mall &s;hare of hatred and envy. The latter have little of that firmne&s;s and patience which makes one of the fine&s;t parts of the character of the native Spaniard. They have little courage, and are univer&s;ally weak and effeminate. Living as they do in a con&s;tant enervating heat, &s;urfeited with wealth, and giving up their whole time to loitering and inactive plea&s;ures, they have nothing bold or manly to fit them for making a figure in active life; and few or none have any ta&s;te for the &s;atisfactions of a learned retirement. Luxurious without variety or elegance, and expen&s;ive with great parade, and little con|veniency,
<PB N="233" REF="243">
their general character is no more than a grave and &s;pecious in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>They are temperate at their tables and in their cups, but from idlene&s;s and con&s;titution, their whole bu&s;ine&s;s is amour and intrigue; the&s;e they carry on in the old Spani&s;h ta&s;te, by doing and &s;aying extravagant things, by bad mu&s;ic, wor&s;e poetry, and exce&s;&s;ive expences. Their ladies are little celebrated for their cha&s;tity or dome&s;tic virtues; but they are &s;till a good deal re&s;trained by the old-fa&s;hioned etiquette, and they exert a genius whichi is not contemptible, in combating the re&s;trants which that lays them under.</P>
<P>The clergy are extremely numerous, and their wealth and influence cannot be doubted among &s;o rich and &s;uper&s;titious a people. It is &s;aid, that they actually po&s;&s;e&s;s a fourth of the revenues of that whole kingdom; which, after all abatements, certainly amounts to &s;everal millions. And as to their numbers, it is not extravagant to &s;ay, that prie&s;ts, monks, and nuns of all orders, are upwards of one fifth of all the white people, both here and in the other parts of Spani&s;h America. But the clergy here being too ignorant in general to be able in&s;tructors by their preaching, and too loo&s;e and debauched in their own manners to in|&s;truct by their example, the people are little the better for their numbers, wealth or influence. Many of them are no other than adventurers
<PB N="234" REF="244">
from Old Spain, who without regard to their character or their vows, &s;tudy nothing but how to rai&s;e a &s;udden fortune, by abu&s;ing the ignorance and extreme credulity of the people. A great deal of attention is paid to certain mechanical methods of devotion. Moral duties are little talked of. An ex|treme veneration for &s;aints, lucrative to the orders they have founded, or are &s;uppo&s;ed to patronize, is &s;trongly inculcated, and makes the general &s;ubject of their &s;ermons, de&s;igned rather to rai&s;e a &s;tupid admiration of their miracles, than an imitation of the &s;anctity of their lives. However, having &s;aid this, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as all general ob&s;ervations, with the rea&s;onable allowances; for many of the dignified clergy, and others among them, under&s;tand, and practi&s;e the duties of their &s;tation, and &s;ome whole orders, as that of the je&s;uits, are here as they are el&s;ewhere, di&s;tin|gui&s;hable for their learning, and the decency of their behaviour And certainly, with all their faults, in one re&s;pect their zeal is highly commendable; that they are the cau&s;e of &s;e|veral charitable foundations; and that they bring the Indians and blacks into &s;ome know|ledge of religion, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure miti|gate their &s;lavery. This too has a good poli|tical effect, for tho&s;e &s;laves are more faith|ful than ours, and though indulged with great|er liberty, are far le&s;s dangerous. I do not
<PB N="235" REF="245">
remember that any in&s;urrection has been ever attempted by them, and the Indians are re|duced to more of a civilized life, than they are in the colonies of any other European nation.</P>
<P>This race of people are now, whatever they were formerly, humble, dejected, timo|rous, and docile; they are generally treated with great indignity, as the &s;tate of all people &s;ubjected to another people, is infinitely wor&s;e than what they &s;uffer from the pre&s;&s;ure of the wor&s;t form, or the wor&s;t admini&s;tration of any government of their own.</P>
<P>The blacks here, as they are imported from Africa, have the &s;ame character as the blacks of our colonies; &s;tubborn, hardy, of an ordinary under&s;tanding, and fitted for the gro&s;s &s;lavery they endure.</P>
<P>Such are the characters of the people, not only of New Spain, but of all Spani&s;h Ame|rica. When any thing materially different occurs, I &s;hall not fail to mention it.</P>
<P>The civil government is admini&s;tered by tribunals, which here are called audiences, con&s;i&s;ting of a certain number of judges, divided into different chambers, more re&s;em|bling the parliaments in France than our courts. At the head of the chief of the&s;e chambers the viceroy him&s;elf pre&s;ides when he &s;ees fit. His employment is one of the greate&s;t tru&s;t and power the king of Spain has in his gift; and is perhaps the riche&s;t govern|ment
<PB N="236" REF="246">
entru&s;ted to any &s;ubject in the world. All employments here are held only by na|tive Spaniards, and by them but for a certain limited time; mo&s;t not above three years. Jealou&s;y, in this re&s;pect, as in all others re|lative to the Indies, is the &s;pirit that influences all their regulations; and it has this very bad effect; that every officer, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, has the avidity which a new and lucrative po&s;t in&s;pires; ravenous becau&s;e his time is &s;hort, he oppre&s;&s;es the people, and defrauds the crown; another &s;ucceeds him with the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions; and no man is careful to e&s;tabli&s;h any thing u&s;eful in his office, knowing that his &s;ucce&s;&s;or will be &s;ure to trample upon every regulation which is not &s;ub&s;ervient to his own intere&s;ts; &s;o that this en&s;laved people has not the power of put|ting in u&s;e the fox's policy, of letting the fir&s;t &s;warm of blood&s;uckers &s;tay on, but is obliged to &s;ubmit to be drained by a con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hungry and impatient harpies.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome troops kept in New Spain, and a good revenue appropriated for their maintenance, and for the &s;upport of the forti|fications there; but the &s;oldiers are few; ill cloathed, ill paid, and wor&s;e di&s;ciplined; the military here keep pace with the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;tration, and every thing is a jobb.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. NEW MEXICO.</HEAD>
<P>NEW Mexico lies to the North and North-Ea&s;t of New Spain. It's bounds to the North are not a&s;certained. Taking in California, it has the great South-Sea to the We&s;t, and to the Ea&s;t it is bounded by the French preten&s;ions on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. This country lies, for the mo&s;t part, within the temperate zone, and has a mo&s;t agreeable climate, and a &s;oil in many places productive of every thing for profit or delight. It has rich mines of &s;ilver, and &s;ome of gold, which are worked more and more every day; and it produces precious &s;tones of &s;everal kinds; but it has no direct intercour&s;e with any part of Europe. The country is but little known at all to Europeans; and the Spani&s;h &s;ettle|ments there are comparatively weak; how|ever, they are every day increa&s;ing, in pro|portion as they di&s;cover mines; which are here not inferior to any that have been di&s;covered in the other parts of Ameri|ca. The inhabitants are mo&s;tly Indians, but in many places lately reduced by the Spani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries, to chri&s;tianity, to a civilized life, to follow trades, and to rai&s;e corn and wine, which they now export pretty largely to Old
<PB N="238" REF="248">
Mexico. This u&s;eful change was principal|ly effected at the expence of a Spani&s;h no|bleman, the marquis Vela&s;co, whom the re|verend author of lord An&s;on's voyage calls, for that rea&s;on, a munificent bigot.</P>
<P>The famous penin&s;ula of California is a part, and far from an incon&s;iderable part of this coun|try. It is a place finely &s;ituated for trade, and has a pearl fi&s;hery of great value. It was fir&s;t di&s;covered by the great conqeror of Mexi|co Hernando Cortes. Our famous admiral and navigator Sir Francis Drake landed there, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1578; and he not only took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but obtained the be&s;t right in the world to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the principal king having formally inve&s;ted him with his principality. However, I do not find that we have thought of a&s;&s;erting that right &s;ince his time; but it may probably employ, in &s;ome future time, the pens of tho&s;e lawyers who di&s;pute with words, what can only be decided by the &s;word, and will afford large matter upon the right of di&s;covery, occupancy and &s;ettlement.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. PERU.</HEAD>
<P>THE conque&s;t of Peru, atchieved in &s;o extraordinary a manner, brought into the power of Spain a country not le&s;s wealthy, and nearly as exten&s;ive as Mexico; but far be|yond it for the conveniency of habitation and the agreablene&s;s of the climate. Like Mexico it is within the torrid zone; yet having on one &s;ide the South-Sea, and on the other the great ridge of the Andes through it's whole length, the joint effects of the ocean and the moun|tains temper the equinoctial heat in a manner equally agreeable and &s;urpri&s;ing. With a &s;ky for the mo&s;t part cloudy, which &s;hields them from the rays of the vertical &s;un, it never rains in this country. But every night a &s;oft be|nign dew broods upon the earth, and refre&s;hes the gra&s;s and plants &s;o as to produce in &s;ome parts the greate&s;t fertility; what the dew wants in perfecting this, is wrought by the va&s;t number of &s;treams, to which the frequent rains and the daily melting of the &s;now on tho&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing mountains give ri&s;e; for tho&s;e mountains, tho' within the tropics, have their tops continually covered with &s;now, which is an appearance unparallelled in the &s;ame climate. Along the &s;ea coa&s;t Peru is generally a
<PB N="240" REF="250">
dry barren &s;and, except by the banks of the rivers and &s;treams we have mentioned, where it is extremly fertile, as are all the valleys in the hilly country.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of the want of rain in all the flat country of Peru, is difficult to be a&s;&s;igned; though the agents in it are not improbably the con&s;tant South-We&s;t wind, that prevails there for the greate&s;t part of the year; and the immen&s;e height of the mountains, cold with a con&s;tant &s;now. The plain country between, refre&s;hed as it is on the one hand by the cool winds that blow from the frigid regions of the South, and heated as uniformly by the di|rect rays of the equinoctial &s;un, pre&s;erves &s;uch an equal temper, that the vapour once eleva|ted can hardly ever de&s;cend in rain: But in the mountainous part of the country, by the al|ternate contraction and dilatation of the air from the daily heats, and the &s;ucceeding colds, which the &s;nows communicate in the ab&s;ence of the &s;un, as well as from the unequal tem|per of the air which prevails in all hilly places, the rain falls very plentifully; the climate in the mountainous countries is ex|tremely changeable, and the changes &s;udden.</P>
<P>All along the coa&s;t of Peru, a current &s;ets &s;trongly to the North; further out to &s;ea it pa&s;&s;es with equal rapidity to the South. This current probably moves eddywi&s;e; for having run as far as it's moving cau&s;e impels
<PB N="241" REF="251">
it, it naturally pa&s;&s;es back again where it has lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. The ignorance of this dou|ble current made the navigation in the South &s;eas originally very uncertain and fatiguing; but now the cour&s;e is, for tho&s;e who pa&s;s from Chili to Peru, to keep in to the &s;hore in their pa&s;&s;age to Callao, and on their return to &s;tand out a great many leagues to &s;ea and take the Southern current homewards. The &s;ame me|thod, but rever&s;ed, is ob&s;erved in the voyages between Panama, and all the other Northern countries, and the ports of Peru.</P>
<P>The commodities of Peru, for export, may be reduced to the&s;e articles. Fir&s;t, &s;ilver and gold; &s;econdly, wine, oil and brandy; thirdly, Vigonia wool; fourthly, je&s;uit's bark; fifthly, Guinea or Jamaica pepper. Of the fir&s;t of the&s;e articles we have already treated in our de&s;cription of Mexico. The mines of gold in Peru, are almo&s;t all in the Northern part, not very remote from Lima; tho&s;e of &s;ilver almo&s;t wholly in the Southern. The voyagers who treat of this country, are generally pret|ty diffu&s;e in their accounts of the principal places, where mines are found; but it does not therefore give us encouragement to in&s;i&s;t much on the&s;e particulars; becau&s;e they con|tain very little in&s;truction in them&s;elves; and if they were things in their own nature in|&s;tructive, it would be little to the purpo&s;e to dwell upon what is continually changing.
<PB N="242" REF="252">
New mines are daily opened, and the old ex|hau&s;ted or de&s;erted. The towns &s;hift with the mines. A rich mine is always founder of a town in proportion to its produce; the town which it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, when the mine is exhau&s;ted, di&s;appears. Indeed the great mines of Poto&s;i in the province of Los Char|cas, are the inheritance of ages; and after having enriched the world for centuries, &s;till continue the inexhau&s;tible &s;ources of new trea&s;ure. They are not however quite &s;o valu|able now as formerly; not &s;o much from any failure of the vein, as from the immen&s;e depth to which they have pur&s;ued it, which by the greater labour nece&s;&s;ary le&s;&s;ens, the profit on what it yields, in proportion as they de&s;cend; be&s;ides new mines are daily opened, which are worked at a le&s;s ex|pence: &s;o that the accounts we have had of the great number which inhabited the city of Poto&s;i, when Mr. Frezier was in that country, mu&s;t have &s;ince &s;uffered &s;ome abatement. It had then upwards of &s;eventy thou&s;and &s;ouls, Spaniards and Indians; of which the latter were &s;ix to one.</P>
<P>The Spaniards oblige this unfortunate peo|ple to &s;end annually a certain number from the villages of the adjacent country, who are compelled to work for a limited time; afterwards they may return. But having lo&s;t the &s;weetne&s;s of their former connections, they
<PB N="243" REF="253">
that &s;urvive this &s;lavery commonly &s;ettle in the city of Poto&s;i. It is incredible how the&s;e mines (the mo&s;t terrible &s;courge with which God could afflict the inhabitants,) have contributed to depopulate this country. Wor&s;e they are than &s;word or pe&s;tilence; equally fatal to their lives; and where tho&s;e e&s;cape, they are embittered by the circum&s;tance of an ignominious &s;lavery, without any pro&s;pect of end or mitigation. The effects of this &s;ervitude would be yet more fatal, if it were not for the u&s;e of an herb which the inhabitants call Coca, to which they a&s;cribe the mo&s;t extraordinary virtues, and which they con&s;tantly u&s;e. It's qualities &s;eem to be of the opiate kind, and to have &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of tobac|co; for it produces a kind of &s;tupid compo|&s;ure. It is an antidote again&s;t poi&s;ons and poi&s;onous effluvia, and makes tho&s;e who u&s;e it, &s;ub&s;i&s;t a long time without food. Though nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e only who work in the mines, it is u&s;ed for plea&s;ure by all the Indians, who chew it con&s;tantly, tho' it makes tho&s;e who u&s;e it &s;tink in a mo&s;t offen&s;ive manner. This herb is gathered by the Indians with many &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, to which they at|tribute it's virtues; for which rea&s;on it is in many parts of Peru, with equal &s;uper&s;tition, &s;trictly forbidden; the Spaniards, as well as the Indians, giving the credit of it's effects to magic, and allowing to the&s;e more than they de|&s;erve;
<PB N="244" REF="254">
for they think the Indians &s;uperiority in &s;trength owing principally to them. How|ever, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the in|qui&s;ition which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in all the Spa|ni&s;h dominions with great terror, nece&s;&s;ity makes them wink at the practice, where the mines are worked.</P>
<P>They make u&s;e of another pre&s;ervative, an infu&s;ion of the herb of Paraguay; &s;omething of the nature of tea. The con&s;umption of this in Peru by all ranks of people is prodi|gious. Above 18,000 hundred weight is annually brought into Chili and Peru, and is worth, when the duty is paid, not le&s;s than 80,000 pounds &s;terling. The fine&s;t of this &s;pecies of tea comes from the country of the je&s;uits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP IX,</HEAD>
<P>THE Southern part of Peru which lies without the tropic of Capricorn, pro|duces wine in great plenty, but not in a perfection proportionable. The Spaniards di&s;|like and leave it to the Indians and negroes, chu&s;ing rather, what may &s;eem odd, to re|gale in the brandy of the &s;ame wine, which is likewi&s;e made and exported in large quan|tities, not only to all parts of Peru, but to Panama, and the ports of New Spain. The greate&s;t quantity is made near a place other|wi&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="255">
of no con&s;equence, called Moquaga; here it is &s;aid they make annually of wine and brandy one hundred thou&s;and jars, which Mr. Frezier reckons at three million two hundred thou&s;and Paris pints. A va&s;t quantity in a &s;mall territory. The value of this produce is four hundred thou&s;and pieces of eight. Other places trade in wine, &s;uch as Pi&s;co, but of a goodne&s;s not &s;uperior. Oil is likewi&s;e had in Peru, but both the wine and oil are mo&s;tly the produce of tho&s;e places that lie beyond the Southern tropic.</P>
<P>Wool makes one of the mo&s;t valuable commodities of the growth of this country. And it is not more remarkable for it's fine long &s;taple, than for the &s;ingularity of the animal which carries it. It is &s;heered from a &s;ort of &s;heep, which they call lamas and vicunnas; the lamas have &s;mall heads, re|&s;embling in &s;ome mea&s;ure both an hor&s;e and &s;heep; the upper lip is cleft like that of the hare, through which, when they are enraged, they &s;pit even to ten paces di&s;tance, a &s;ort of envenomed juice, which, when it falls on the &s;kin, cau&s;es a red &s;pot and great itching. The neck is long like that of a camel; the body re&s;embles that of a &s;heep, but the legs are much longer in proportion. This animal has a di&s;agreeable &s;mell, but it's fle&s;h is good; and it is extremely u&s;eful, not only for
<PB N="246" REF="256">
the wool, which is very long and fine, but as it is a bea&s;t of burthen, &s;trong, patient, and kept at a very ea&s;y expence. It &s;eldom caries above one hundred and fifty pound weight, but then it carries that weight a va&s;t way without tiring, eats very little, and never drinks. As &s;oon as night comes the lama lies down, and no blows can get him to move one foot after the time he de&s;tines for his re&s;t and food.</P>
<P>The vicunna is an animal re&s;embling the lama, pretty much as the dromedary does the camel. He is &s;maller and &s;wifter, with a far finer wool, but otherwi&s;e exactly like the lama in all re&s;pects. The wool of the&s;e creatures is almo&s;t as fine as &s;ilk. Probably the famous &s;heep of Cachemir, of who&s;e wool they make the little white cloths &s;o much valued in India, is of this &s;pecies. I cannot a&s;certain what quantity of this wool is exported manufactured or raw out of Peru, either to New or Old Spain; but I have rea&s;on to believe it is not at all incon&s;i|rable.</P>
<P>The fourth great article of their commerce is je&s;uit's bark, &s;o well known in medicine as a &s;pecific in intermitting di&s;orders, and the many other great purpo&s;es, which experience daily finds it to an&s;wer. The tree which produces this valuable bark, grows principally in the mountainous parts of Peru, and that
<PB N="247" REF="257">
mo&s;t and be&s;t in the province of Quito. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ondamine informs us, that it grows on the hither &s;ide of the Andes, no way inferior to the Peruvian in quantity and goodne&s;s; the be&s;t is produced on the high and rocky grounds; and it is not &s;ingular in this, for it &s;eems in a good mea&s;ure to be the ca&s;e of all plants, who&s;e juices are much more &s;trong and effective when elaborated in &s;uch &s;ituations. The tree which bears it is about the &s;ize of a cherry-tree; it's leaves are round and indent|ed; it bears a long reddi&s;h flower, from whence ari&s;es a &s;ort of hu&s;k, which envelopes a flat and white kernel, not unlike an almond. This bark was fir&s;t introduced in France by the cardinal Lago, a je&s;uit, about the year 1650. Hence it had it's name of je&s;uit's bark. It is &s;aid to have been di&s;covered by the accident of an Indian's drinking in a fever of the water of a lake into which &s;ome of the&s;e trees had fallen, and by which he was cured. This medicine, as u&s;ual, was held in defiance for a good while by the faculty; but after an ob&s;ti|nate defence, they have thought proper at la&s;t to &s;urrender. Notwith&s;tanding all the mi&s;|chiefs at fir&s;t fore&s;een in it's u&s;e, every body knows that it is at this day innocently and efficaciou&s;ly pre&s;cribed in a great variety of ca&s;es; for which rea&s;on it makes a con&s;iderable and valuable part of the cargo of the gal|leons.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="258">Guinea pepper, Agi, or as it is called by us, Cayenne pepper is a very great article in the trade of Peru, as it is u&s;ed all over Spani&s;h America in almo&s;t every thing they eat. This is produced in the greate&s;t quantity in the vale of Arica, a di&s;trict in the Southern parts of Peru, from whence they export to the annual value of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns. The di&s;trict which produces this pepper in &s;uch abundance, is but &s;mall, and naturally barren; it's fertility in pepper, as well as in grain and fruits, is owing to the advantage of a &s;pecies of very extraordinary manure, brought from an i&s;land called Iquiqua. This is a &s;ort of yellowi&s;h earth, of a fetid &s;mell. It is generally thought to be dung of birds, becau&s;e of the &s;imilitude of the &s;cent, that feathers have been found very deep in it, and that va&s;t numbers of &s;ea fowls appear upon that and all the adjacent coa&s;ts. But on the other hand, whether we look upon this &s;ub&s;tance as the dung of the&s;e &s;ea fowls, or a particular &s;pecies of earth, it is almo&s;t equally difficult to con|ceive how the &s;mall i&s;land of Iquiqua, not above two miles in cireumference, could &s;up|ply &s;uch immen&s;e quantities; and yet after &s;upplying upwards of twelve &s;hip loads an|nually for a century together for the di&s;tant parts, and a va&s;tly larger quantity for the u&s;e of the neighbourhood, it cannot be ob&s;erved that it is in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed, or that the
<PB N="249" REF="259">
height of the i&s;land is at all le&s;&s;ened. But the&s;e are matters, which to handle properly, requires a more exact knowledge of all the circum&s;tances relating to them, than can be gathered from travellers.</P>
<P>Quick&s;ilver is a remarkable article in their trade, becau&s;e the purification of their gold and &s;ilver depends upon it. I do not find that any other part of the Spani&s;h America produces it; &s;o that Mexico and Terra Firma are &s;upplied from Old Spain with all they want of that mineral, which is brought them on the king's account only; except that &s;ome arrives from from Peru in a counterband manner. In Peru likewi&s;e it is monopolized by the crown. The principal mine of this extraordinary &s;ub&s;tance is at a place called Guancavelica, where it is found in a whiti&s;h ma&s;s, re&s;emb|ling brick ill burned; this they pound, and put into a furnace vaulted at the top; it is laid upon an iron grate covered with earth. Thro' this the fire pa&s;&s;es, and volatilizing the mineral, it is rai&s;ed in a &s;moak, which finding no pa&s;&s;age but through a little hole contrived for that purpo&s;e, it ru&s;hes through it into a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of little round ve&s;&s;els, united to each other by the necks; here the &s;moak circulates, and it conden&s;es by means of a little water at the bottom of each ve&s;&s;el, into which the quick&s;ilver falls in a pure heavy liquid. The men who work in the mines of this mineral,
<PB N="250" REF="260">
are yet mroe &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es than tho&s;e who toil in the others, and they make u&s;e of the &s;ame pre&s;ervatives of Paraguay, tea and coca.</P>

<P>THE manners of the Spaniards and Creolians of Peru re&s;emble, with little difference, tho&s;e of the Spaniards and Creolians of Mexico, other than that the natives of Peru &s;eem to be of a more liberal turn, and of greater ingenuity, but they are equally de&s;titute of all cultivation. The &s;lavery of the Indians is here yet more &s;evere. The magi&s;trate and the prie&s;t devour their whole &s;ub&s;tance; and every Spaniard in&s;ults them with impunity. The traveller takes as much of their provi&s;ion as he plea&s;es, and de|cides for him&s;elf what he &s;hall pay, or whe|ther he &s;hall pay any thing at all. Com|plaints are an&s;wered with new indignities, and with blows, which it is a crime to return. This cruel irregular bondage contributes to di&s;people this country even more than the methodical tyranny of the government. To avoid the plunder he is hourly &s;ubject to, the ma&s;ter of the family often rai&s;es no more grain than what ju&s;t &s;uffices for the &s;u&s;tenance of his family; this he buries, and he keeps the &s;ecret of his hoard to him&s;elf, only drawing
<PB N="251" REF="261">
out daily ju&s;t &s;o much as &s;erves for the u&s;e of the day. If he chances to die &s;uddenly, the family &s;tarves; if a bad &s;ea&s;on comes, the calculated produce falls &s;hort, and they are all reduced to beggary. Yet wor&s;e, they are even the &s;laves of &s;laves; for the Spaniards encourage their negroes to treat them with the greate&s;t in&s;olence; and they politically keep up a rancour, now grown inveterate be|tween the&s;e two races of people. They are forbidden, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, to marry, or to have an unlawful intercour&s;e to|gether. Divi&s;ion is the great in&s;trument in which the Spaniards tru&s;t for the pre&s;ervation of their colonies. The native Spaniard has alone all the lucrative offices, civil, eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, and military. He de&s;pi&s;es the Creolian. The Creolian hates and envies him. Both contemn and maltreat the Indians, who, on their &s;ide, are not in&s;en&s;ible of the indignities they &s;uffer. The blacks are encouraged to trample on the Indians, and to con&s;ider their intere&s;ts as altogether oppo&s;ite; whil&s;t the Indians in their nominal freedom look with an envious di&s;dain upon the &s;lavery of the negroes, which makes them their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>What is extraordinary, the Spaniards, not content with reducing this unhappy nation under &s;o cruel a yoke, as if they thought it nothing, unle&s;s they were thoroughly &s;en|&s;ible of it's weight, &s;uffer the Indians to cele|brate
<PB N="252" REF="262">
an annual fe&s;tival, in which plays are re|pre&s;ented, commemorating the overthrow of their own &s;tate. The&s;e are acted with all the horrid and aggravating circum&s;tances which attended this event; and the people are at this time &s;o enraged, that the Spaniards find it dangerous to go abroad. In the city of Lima, there is annually celebrated a fe&s;tival of this kind, with a grand proce&s;&s;ion, wherein they carry in a &s;ort of triumph the remaining de&s;cendant of the yncas of Peru, and his wife; who at that time receive all imaginable ho|nours in the mo&s;t melancholy pomp, from a race bowed down with the &s;en&s;e of the com|mon bondage of prince and people. This throws the mo&s;t affecting gloom over the fe&s;tival that renews the image of their former freedom. To this remaining ynca the viceroy of Peru does homage when he enters upon his government. The ynca &s;its upon a lofty &s;tage, and the viceroy makes his obei&s;ance upon an hor&s;e, who is taught to kneel upon the occa&s;ion. This manner of proceeding may be thought of the mo&s;t refined &s;train of in&s;olent tyranny, and to be as unpolitic as it is in&s;ulting; but it is not impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e vents, which they &s;uffer the indignation of the people to take, may carry off a &s;pirit, that might otherwi&s;e break out in a much more fatal manner. However it is, whether by the divi&s;ion they keep up, or by the&s;e vents, or
<PB N="253" REF="263">
by the management of the clergy, or by whatever means, the Spaniards pre&s;erve their conque&s;ts with very little force; the Indians are even armed, and make a con&s;iderable part of their militia; it is true, they are interdicted the u&s;e of weapons without licence; but licence is procured without much difficulty. They have likewi&s;e a large number of free blacks, and they too are formed into com|panies in their militia. Certain it is, that both in the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e colonies, they find &s;lavery compatible enough with great licence in &s;ome re&s;pects, and both with the &s;ecurity of the ma&s;ters. Things de&s;erving our con&s;ideration; as we do not &s;eem to excell in the conciliating arts of government in our colonies, nor to think that any thing is to be effected by other in&s;truments than tho&s;e of terror and rude force.</P>

<P>THERE are three cities in Peru famous for their opulence and trade; Lima, Cu&s;co, and Quito. Lima lies in the Northern part of Peru, about two leagues from the &s;ea, upon a river called Rimac, &s;mall and unnavi|gable. This is the capital of Peru, and of all South America; a beautiful city, with the &s;treets laid out with the greate&s;t regularity, cutting each other at equal di&s;tances and right
<PB N="254" REF="264">
angles; the hou&s;es, on account of the equality of the climate, are only covered with mats, as they are built low to avoid the con&s;equences of earthquakes, frequent and dreadful in this country. They are painted all over both in&s;ide and out&s;ide, with flowers and land&s;kips, and other ornamental fancies, not altogether un&s;kilfully executed. To add to the elegance and convenience of this city, mo&s;t hou&s;es have a little garden, which is watered by cuts drawn from the river; &s;o that each man com|mands a little running &s;tream for his own u&s;e; in a hot and dry country as this is, no &s;mall matter of convenience and delight. They have a walk by the river &s;ide two hundred fathom long, con&s;i&s;ting of five rows of fine orange trees. Here the company re&s;orts at five in the evening drawn in their cala&s;hes; of which, &s;uch is the opulence of this city, they had no le&s;s than four thou&s;and in the year 1715. It has fifty-four churches, taking in the cathedral, the parochial, and conventual; twenty mona&s;teries of men, one of which contains &s;even hundred, and another five hun|dred friars and &s;ervants; twelve nunneries, one of which has not le&s;s than three hundred nuns; and twelve ho&s;pitals, be&s;ides foun|dations for the portioning of poor girls. With the&s;e the whole number of the inha|bitants is &s;aid not to exceed thirty thou|&s;and.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="265">They tell a very remarkable fact, that may help us to &s;ome idea of the va&s;t wealth of this City. When their viceroy the duke de la Palata made his publick en|try in 1682, they cau&s;ed two of the prin|cipal &s;treets to be paved with ingots of &s;ilver, that had paid the fifth to the king, of between twelve and fifteen inches long, four or five in breadth, and two or three in thickne&s;s; the whole of which could not amount to le&s;s than &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen millions &s;ter|ling. The trade of the French to Peru, du|ring the general war in Europe which was cau&s;ed by the di&s;putes about the Spani&s;h &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, made this city decay not a little by diffu&s;ing the commerce, of which before it was the center, among&s;t the other towns which lie along the coa&s;t; but as that pri|vilege has been &s;ince taken away, Lima began to revive again, and continued in great &s;plendor until the year 1747, when a mo&s;t tremendous earthquake, which entirely de|voured Callao the port belonging to it, laid three fourths of this city level with the ground. The de&s;truction of Callao was the mo&s;t per|fect and terrible that can be conceived; no more than one of all the inhabitants e&s;cap|ing, and he by a providence the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extraordinary imaginable. This man was on the fort that overlooked the harbour, going to &s;trike the flag, when he perceived

the &s;ea to retire to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and then &s;welling mountain high it returned with great violence. The inhabitants ran from their hou&s;es in the utmo&s;t terror and confu&s;ion; he heard a cry of <HI>mi&s;erere</HI> ri&s;e from all parts of the city; and immediately all was &s;ilent; the &s;ea had entirely overwhelm|ed this city, and buried it for ever in it's bo&s;om; but the &s;ame wave which de&s;troyed the city, drove a little boat by the place where the man &s;tood, into which he threw him|&s;elf and was &s;aved. What is remarkable too in this affair, Mr. Frezier, who was in Peru in the year 1714, and from whom I have part of my materials, on con&s;idering the &s;ituation of this town and the nature of the country, ventured to prophe&s;y for it the de&s;truction, which we have &s;een ac|compli&s;hed in our days. Whil&s;t this town &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, it contained about 3000 inhabitants of all kinds, had five convents, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fine&s;t port in all Peru. Here were the rich warehou&s;es furni&s;hed with all the goods of Eu|rope, which being landed by the galleons at Portobello were brought over land to Panama, and thence tran&s;ported hither by the arma|dilla, or fleet, with a convoy of three men of war re&s;erved for this purpo&s;e. To this port arrived the annual &s;hip from Acapulco loaden with all the products of the Ea&s;t; from Chili it received va&s;t quantities of
<PB N="257" REF="267">
corn, dried beef and pork, leather, tallow, plank, and &s;everal &s;orts of woollen goods, particularly carpets like tho&s;e of Turkey. From the ports of Peru were brought &s;ugars, wine and brandy, naval &s;tores, cacao and to|bacco. From Mexico it had pitch and tar, woods for dying, and that bal&s;am, which we improperly call of Peru, &s;ince it comes from Guatimala. As the port of Callao is &s;o excellent, and as it is that by which the trade of Lima wholly, and that of all Peru in a great mea&s;ure, mu&s;t be carried on, we cannot doubt but that a new city is alrea|dy built there; and that Lima is re&s;tored to it's former lu&s;tre; e&s;pecially as this latter is the &s;eat of &s;o great a government. For to the viceroy of Peru, both Chili and Terra Firma are &s;ubject. His &s;ettled &s;alary is 40,000 pieces of eight yearly; his perqui&s;ites are great; as often as he goes to Callao, he is intitled to 3000 pieces of eight for that little airing; he has 10,000 for every pro|gre&s;s into more di&s;tant parts; he has the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of above a hundred great ma|gi&s;tracies; and, in &s;hort, the granting of all triennial employments both civil and mili|tary throughout the extent of his ample juri&s;diction. It cannot therefore be doubted that his perqui&s;ites, even his lawful ones, (for there are many others,) at lea&s;t double the value of his &s;alary. And certainly, whatever
<PB N="258" REF="268">
the king of Spain may lo&s;e by the bad oeconomy in his affairs, no prince in the world has &s;uch means of rewarding the &s;ervices of his &s;ubjects, without any imme|diate burthen upon his own revenues.</P>
<P>Cu&s;co, the capital of the ancient empire, is &s;till a very con&s;iderable city; it is at a good di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and &s;ituated in the mountainous part of the country; it has not le&s;s than forty thou&s;and inhabitants, three parts Indians, who are very indu&s;trious and ingenious. Though little in&s;tructed in the art, many &s;hew the rudiments of a ta&s;te for painting; and there are an incredible quantity of pictures painted here, which are di&s;per&s;ed all over Peru and Chili. They have here likewi&s;e, manufactures of bays and cot|ton, and they work largely in leather in mo&s;t of the ways in which it is u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Quito is likewi&s;e an inland town; it is &s;ituated in the mo&s;t northern part of Peru; it is a con&s;iderable place, and drives a great trade with the Indians; but I can get but little account of the inhabitants, or the ma|nufactures which employ them.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to calculate the number of in|habitants in Peru, becau&s;e we have none of tho&s;e data which are nece&s;&s;ary to ground &s;uch a calculation. There are a good many large and populous towns di&s;per&s;ed through that coun|try; but in many places it is little better
<PB N="259" REF="269">
than a de&s;art; partly for want of water, but much more generally through the pride of one part of the people, the mi&s;erable &s;ubjection of the other, and the &s;loth of all. The mines undoubtedly contribute largely to depopulate the country, by turning the inhabitants from agriculture and manufac|tures, employments that prolong life and provide for it, to the working of metals extremely pernicious to health, and which makes them depend upon others for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance. The nations which are poor in re&s;pect of gold, and indu&s;trious from that poverty, have not the lea&s;t rea|&s;on to envy the wealth of the Peruvians; who, amid&s;t all that extravagant glare that dazzles the eye, live penuriou&s;ly and &s;or|didly; and are often in extreme want in a country, which in many places is one of the mo&s;t fertile in the world. In fact, the countries which employ their men in arts and in agriculture, and receive their return in gold and &s;ilver from the countries which abound in tho&s;e metals, may be con&s;idered as the real proprietors of the mines; the imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, only as their &s;tewards to manage, or as their &s;laves to work them; whil&s;t they are employed them&s;elves only at an ea&s;y labour, friendly to life, and nece&s;|&s;ary to their well-being.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. CHILI.</HEAD>
<P>IMmediately to the Southward of Peru lies Chili, extending it&s;elf in a long narrow &s;lip, along the coa&s;t of the South-Sea, in the South temperate zone. The air here is remarkably clear aad &s;erene. Scarce any changes happen for three parts of the year. Very little rain falls during that period. But the benign dews every night, and the many rivulets which the neighbourhood of the Andes &s;upplies them, fertilize the plain country, and make it produce as much corn, wine, oil, and fruits, as the number of the inhabitants, which is very &s;mall, or their indu&s;try, which is but moderate, will &s;uffer them to cultivate. If it were under a more favourable government, and better peopled, there is hardly any part of the world which could enter into competition with this. For at the &s;ame time that it enjoys a very health|ful air, and is warmed by an heat no way op|pre&s;&s;ive, it bears many of the tropical fruits that would thrive no where el&s;e out of the torrid zone. It is luxuriant on the &s;urface with every thing for profit and delight; and beneath it is rich to profu&s;ion with veins of
<PB N="261" REF="271">
gold, &s;ilver, copper, lead, quick&s;ilver, and iron. Tho&s;e of gold are the mo&s;t wrought; and in|deed there is &s;carce a rivulet in the country in which gold is not found in &s;maller or greater plenty; but want of people, which is here more felt than in the other Spani&s;h &s;ettle|ments, hinders them from working all their mines; and what is wor&s;e, from improving the &s;urface of their country to any thing like the degree of perfection to which it might be brought. For in this whole extent of coun|try, upwards of twelve hundred miles in length, and from three hundred to five hundred miles in breadth, it is not reckoned they have much above twenty thou&s;and whites fit to bear arms, and about three times that number of Indians, blacks, and mulattoes. Yet with &s;o few hands, and tho&s;e not the mo&s;t in|du&s;trious, they export annually from the ports of Chili, to Callao, and other ports of Peru, corn enough to &s;upport &s;ixty thou&s;and men; great quantities of wine; hemp, (which is rai&s;ed in no other part on the South-Seas,) hides, tallow, and &s;alted provi&s;ions; to &s;ay no|thing of the gold, and other minerals which form their principal wealth. This country is in general, not &s;o fit for pa&s;turage, tho' it has a &s;ufficient number of u&s;eful cattle of all &s;orts. Tho&s;e who&s;e fle&s;h they &s;alt, and in who&s;e hides they trade to Peru, come from the other &s;ide of the Andes, from the province of Tucu|man
<PB N="262" REF="272">
in Paraguay. Chili has but a very few bea&s;ts of prey, and tho&s;e timorous; and al|though toads, &s;nakes, and &s;corpions, are here as numerous as in other hot countries, they are found entirely harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>There are in Chili four towns of &s;ome note, either on the &s;ea or near it; St. Jago which is the capital, La Conception, Coquimbo or La Serena, and Baldivia. The three fir&s;t of the&s;e towns are laid out in a manner exactly re&s;embling each other, the &s;treets, like tho&s;e of Lima, cutting one another &s;o as to form &s;quares like tho&s;e of a draft board. They have all gardens between the hou&s;es, and running waters drawn from the neighbouring rivers to fertilize them; but the hou&s;es are &s;o low and meanly built, (mud walls, and thatch in &s;ome,) that they rather re&s;emble agreeable country villages than cities of bu&s;ine&s;s or gran|deur. However, &s;ome of the hou&s;es are well furni&s;hed, and it is &s;aid, that in St. Jago there are many, which have the meane&s;t uten&s;ils of the kitchen, of gold and &s;ilver. As for Baldi|via, it is not more remarkable for being the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;s in the South-Seas, than for the manner in which it is peopled; for hither the criminals from Peru and the other parts of Chili are tran&s;ported, either for a time, or for life, and obliged to labour upon the fortifica|tions and other public works. What is &s;in|gular, the&s;e criminals are at once the pri&s;oners
<PB N="263" REF="273">
and the jailors; for the garri&s;on of the place, the whole corps, &s;oldiers and officers, is formed of no other. The town contains about two thou&s;and &s;ouls, and all of them bani&s;hed people, or the de&s;cendants of &s;uch.</P>
<P>The trade of Chili is entirely confined to what they carry on with Peru, one or two ports of New Spain, and with Panama. None of their &s;hips ever penetrate the &s;traits of Magellan, or pa&s;s Cape Horn. They &s;end their commodities to the&s;e ports in Mexico and Peru, and receive their European goods from Panama.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS in Chili they are weak in men, and have a large body of independent In|dians, ill-affected to them on their borders, and know that the Dutch once attempted an e&s;tabli&s;hment here, and that other people have nouri&s;hed projects of the &s;ame nature, they are extremely cautious and watchful on the coa&s;t, and the country is immediately in arms upon every alarm; which is given when any &s;hip appears off the coa&s;t that is not of Spani&s;h built. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all their caution, their &s;ecurity is rather owing to the &s;y&s;tem of Europe, of which it is a part to keep the Spani&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the hands of the pre&s;ent proprietors, and to the difficult and dangerous
<PB N="264" REF="274">
pa&s;&s;age of the &s;traits of Magellan or Cape Horn, for any European armament of force, than either to their own &s;trength or vigilance.</P>
<P>The Indian inhabitants of Chili are a brave and warlike people, who defended their liber|ties vigorou&s;ly, made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;ur|rections, killed Peter Baldivia the conqueror of the country, and maintained a war again&s;t the whole Spani&s;h power in that part of the world for &s;everal years; which was only ter|minated on the part of &s;everal of the nations near the mountains, by an honourable peace, which is pre&s;erved to this day. None can be more jealou&s;ly watchful than this people of their freedom. They traffic indeed with the Spaniards, but with &s;o much caution, and under limitations &s;o &s;trict, that they can take very little advantage of this communication. As for tho&s;e who were obliged to &s;ubmit, it is to a yoke nothing near &s;o heavy as that which oppre&s;&s;es the people who inhabit the other Spani&s;h provinces; partly from the better terms which were procured; and partly from the fear of a nation, whom they have expe|rienced to be brave, and know to be &s;urround|ed with many, who are of the &s;ame blood, and have defended their freedom with better &s;ucce&s;s. A good example, even in the unfor|tunate, how much a brave defence of liberty may contribute to procure, if nothing el&s;e, yet a more tolerable &s;ervitude. The Indians
<PB N="265" REF="275">
of this country have more re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of North America, though more humane and civilized in their manners, than to the Peru|vians and Mexicans. Here they have le&s;s &s;uper&s;tition naturally; and far from having that exce&s;&s;ive veneration, which tho&s;e na|tions had for their kings, they have no kings at all, and very little form of government; each family being &s;overeign within itfelf, and independent. The bu&s;ine&s;s which concerns them all, is tran&s;acted in the a&s;&s;emblies of all; and the plurality of voices decides. They are much given to liquor; and they practi&s;e polygamy, which in America is not common. However, the Spani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries have now made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s among&s;t the&s;e free nations; they have a college for the edu|cation of the Indian youth; and their influence is a great means of pre&s;erving peace between the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements and the free Indians on their borders, which, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would be difficult. For though they li&s;ten to the Spani&s;h prie&s;ts, they pre&s;erve a very ju&s;t terror of falling under their government, and no &s;mall hatred to the people.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. PARAGUAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE country of Paraguay, or La Plata, &s;huts up the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of a con&s;ide|rable part of Chili and Peru; whence extend|ing over a tract of country, above a thou&s;and miles broad, it bounds Brazil upon the We&s;t, and upon the South butts upon the At|lantic ocean; being fifteen hundred miles at lea&s;t in length, from the mouth of the great river Plata to it's Northern boundary the country of the Amazons. This va&s;t terri|tory is far from being wholly &s;ubdued or planted by the Spaniards. There are many parts in a great degree unknown to them, or to any other people of Europe. In &s;uch a va&s;t country, and lying in climates &s;o diffe|rent, for it lies on the Northern frontier under the equinoctial line, and on the South advances to the thirty-&s;eventh degree of latitude, far into the South temperate zone, we mu&s;t ex|pect to meet great diver&s;ity of &s;oil and pro|duct. However, in general this great country is fertile; the pa&s;tures particularly are &s;o rich, that they are covered with innumerable herds of black cattle, hor&s;es and mules; in which hardly any body thinks it worth his while to claim a property. Any per&s;on takes and breaks them according to his occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="277">This country, be&s;ides an infinite number of &s;maller rivers, is watered by three prin|cipal ones, which unite near the &s;ea, to form the famous Rio de la Plata. The fir&s;t is Paraguay, from whence the country is deno|minated; this forms the main channel. It has it's origin from a great lake in the center of South America, called the lake of Xarayes, and runs in a cour&s;e nearly North and South. Parana, which ri&s;es among&s;t the mountains on the frontiers of Brazil, runs a &s;loping cour&s;e to the South-We&s;t, until it joins the Paraguay at a great di&s;tance from the ocean about the twenty-&s;eventh degree of South latitude. U|raguay ri&s;es likewi&s;e upon the &s;ame &s;ide, and runs almo&s;t an equal cour&s;e before it meets tho&s;e united rivers at no great di&s;tance from the ocean, with which it mixes, along with them.</P>
<P>The principal province which concerns us in this va&s;t tract, is that which is called Rio de la Plata, towards the mouth of the above-mentioned rivers. This province, with all the adjacent parts, is one continued level, interrupt|ed by not the lea&s;t hill for &s;everal hundreds of miles every way; extremely fertile in mo&s;t things; but contrary to the general nature of America, de&s;titute of woods; this want they en|deavour to &s;upply by plantations of every kind of fruit trees; all which thrive here to admira|tion. The air is remarkably &s;weet and &s;erene,
<PB N="268" REF="278">
and the waters of the great river are equal|ly pure and whol&s;ome; they annually over|flow their banks; and on their rece&s;s, leave them enriched with a &s;lime, which produces the greate&s;t plenty of whatever is committed to it.</P>
<P>The principal town is Buenos Ayres, on the South &s;ide of the river; it was &s;o cal|led upon account of the excellence of the air. This town is the only place of traf|fic to the Southward of Brazil; yet it's trade, con&s;idering the rich and exten&s;ive country to which it is the avenue, is very incon&s;iderable. No regular fleet comes here, as to the other parts of Spani&s;h America; two, or at mo&s;t three regi&s;ter &s;hips, make the whole of their regular intercour&s;e with Europe. Their returns are very valuable, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of gold, &s;ilver, &s;ugar and hides. I cannot learn that they have opened any con&s;iderable mines in this province; but it is probable there are rich ones in the pro|vinces, which lie to the Ea&s;tward of the Andes; be&s;ides it is certain that a good deal of gold is returned from Chili, for the mules, cattle and tea which are &s;ent thither; and that &s;ilver from the province of Los Charcas in Peru is &s;ent upon the &s;ame account, for the mo&s;t part by land carriage. There is be&s;ides a tolerable water carriage; for a large river, called Pilcomayo, ri&s;es not far from the
<PB N="269" REF="279">
mines of Poto&s;i, which winding among&s;t the openings of the Cordillera, di&s;charges it&s;elf at la&s;t into the Paraguay; and this river is navigable to the very &s;ource, allowing for the interruption of &s;ome falls, which is the ca&s;e of the river of Plate it&s;elf. By this way it is, I judge, that a great quan|tity of &s;ilver comes to Buenos Ayres. In|deed it is in great plenty in that province; and tho&s;e who now and then carry on a counterband trade to this country, find it far more advantageous than any other what&s;o|ever.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE trade of Paraguay, and the man|ners of the people, are &s;o much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h colonies in South America, that nothing fur|ther can be &s;aid on tho&s;e articles; but it would be inexcu&s;able to quit the country without &s;aying &s;omething of that extraor|dinary &s;pecies of commonwealth which the je&s;uits have erected in the interior parts.</P>
<P>About the middle of the la&s;t century tho&s;e fathers repre&s;ented to the court of Madrid, that their want of &s;ucce&s;s in their mi&s;&s;ions was owing to the &s;candal which the im|morality of the Spaniards never failed to give,
<PB N="270" REF="280">
and to the hatred which their in&s;olent be|haviour cau&s;ed in the Indians wherever they came. They in&s;inuated, that if it were not for that impediment, the empire of the go&s;|pel might, by their labours, have been ex|tended into the mo&s;t unknown parts of America; and that all tho&s;e countries might be &s;ubdued to his catholic maje&s;ty's obedience without expence and without force. This remon&s;trance was li&s;tened to with attention; the &s;phere of their labours was marked out; an uncontrouled liberty was given to the je&s;uits within the&s;e limits; and the governors of the adjacent provinces had or|ders not to interfere, nor to &s;uffer any Spa|niard to enter into this pale without licence from the fathers. They on their part a|greed, to pay a certain capitation tax in pro|portion to their flock; and to &s;end a cer|tain number to the king's works when|ever they &s;hould be demanded, and the mi&s;&s;ions &s;hould become populous enough to &s;upply them.</P>
<P>On the&s;e terms the je&s;uits entered upon the &s;cene of action, and opened their &s;piritual cam|paign. They began by gathering together about fifty wandering families, whom they per&s;uad|ed to &s;ettle; and they united them into a little town&s;hip. This was the &s;light foun|dation upon which they have built a &s;uper|&s;tru&s;ture,
<PB N="271" REF="281">
which has amazed the world, and added &s;o much power, at the &s;ame time that it has brought &s;o much envy and jealou&s;y on their &s;ociety. For when they had made this beginning, they laboured with &s;uch inde|fatigable pains, and with &s;uch ma&s;terly policy, that, by degrees, they mollified the minds of the mo&s;t &s;avage nations; fixed the mo&s;t ram|bling; and &s;ubdued the mo&s;t aver&s;e to govern|ment. They prevailed upon thou&s;ands of various di&s;per&s;ed tribes of people to embrace their religion, and to &s;ubmit to their govern|ment; and when they had &s;ubmitted, the je&s;uits left nothing undone, that could conduce to their remaining in this &s;ubjection, or that could tend to increa&s;e their number to the degree requi&s;ite for a well ordered and potent &s;ociety; and their labours were attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that from &s;uch incon&s;iderable be|ginnings, &s;everal years ago, their &s;ubjects a|mounted to three hundred thou&s;and families. They lived in towns; they were regularly clad; they laboured in agriculture; they exer|ci&s;ed manufactures. Some even a&s;pired to the elegant arts. They were in&s;tructed in the military with the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline; and could rai&s;e &s;ixty thou&s;and men well armed. To effect the&s;e purpo&s;es, from time to time they brought over from Europe &s;eve|ral handicraft men, mu&s;icians, and painters.
<PB N="272" REF="282">
The&s;e, I am told, were principally from Ger|many and Italy.</P>
<P>We are far from being able to trace with the exactne&s;s they de&s;erve, all the &s;teps which were taken in the accompli&s;hment of &s;o ex|traordinary a conque&s;t over the bodies and minds of &s;o many people, without arms or violence; and differently from the methods of all other conque&s;ts; not by cutting off a large part of the inhabitants to &s;ecure the re&s;t, but by multiplying their people, whil&s;t they ex|tended their territory. Their own accounts are not very ample; and they are partial to them&s;elves without doubt. What others have written is with a glaring prejudice a|gain&s;t them. The particulars which &s;eem be&s;t agreed upon by both &s;ides, are the only ones to be mentioned.</P>
<P>It is agreed then, that in each mi&s;&s;ion or di&s;trict (the country is divided into forty-&s;even di&s;tricts) a je&s;uit pre&s;ides in chief. He is lodged in a large and commodious hou&s;e called the pre&s;bitery. Adjoining to this hou&s;e are the church, and the public magazines. No per&s;on under the juri&s;diction of the fathers has any thing that can ju&s;tly be called his own property. Each man's labour is allotted him in proportion to his &s;trength, or to his &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion which he exerci&s;es. The pro|duct is brought faithfully into the public ma|gazines; from whence he is again &s;upplied
<PB N="273" REF="283">
with all things which the managers judge to be expedient for the &s;u&s;tenance of him&s;elf or his family. All nece&s;&s;aries are di&s;tributed re|gularly twice a week; and the magazines al|ways contain &s;uch a &s;tock of provi&s;ions and goods of every kind, as to an&s;wer not only the ordinary exigencies, but to provide again&s;t a time of &s;carcity, or for tho&s;e whom accidents, age, or infirmities, have di&s;qualified for la|bour.</P>
<P>They provide early for the marriage of their young people, as well to prevent di&s;or|ders, as to multiply their &s;ubjects. Here, as intere&s;t can be no motive to the union, there are few difficulties attending it. The young man applies to the governing je&s;uit, informs him of his de&s;ire of marriage, and names the party: &s;he is con&s;ulted, and if there is no ob|jection upon her part, they are immediately married. They are &s;upplied with all nece&s;|&s;aries for their e&s;tabli&s;hment from the public &s;tores, and they have at the &s;ame time their ta&s;k allotted them, by which they are to make amends for what they have received, and to provide for others in their turn.</P>
<P>Under the je&s;uit are magi&s;trates, or cazi|ques, of the Indian nation, who regulate all the&s;e matters, decide &s;uch differences as are too minute for the attention of the father, and give him regularly an exact account of the &s;tate of his di&s;trict, and the merit and de|merit
<PB N="274" REF="284">
of the people which it contains. They are rewarded or puni&s;hed according to this report. The puni&s;hment is by blows, from which it is &s;aid not even the principal magi|&s;trates are exempted. The&s;e are however re|ceived by all, not only with patience, but ac|knowledgment. The rewards are &s;eldom more than benedictions, and &s;ome &s;light marks of the je&s;uits favour, which make tho&s;e men entirely happy.</P>
<P>Nothing can equal the obedience of the people of the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions, except their content|ment under it. Far from murmuring, that they have only the nece&s;&s;aries of life, by a la|bour which might in &s;ome degree procure them the conveniencies of it, they think them|&s;elves a di&s;tingui&s;hed and favoured people in wanting them; and they believe their obe|dience a duty, that not only &s;ecures their order and repo&s;e in this world, but the very be&s;t means of in&s;uring their happine&s;s in the next. This is carefully inculcated; and in|deed be&s;ides their attention to the govern|ment, the je&s;uits are indefatigable in their in|&s;tructions in the doctrines of religion, the re|gularity of life, and the contempt of this world. And by what I can find, the Indians under their juri&s;diction are an innocent people, civilized without being corrupted.</P>
<P>The je&s;uits who govern them, are &s;aid to be extremely &s;trict in pre&s;erving their privilege in
<PB N="275" REF="285">
keeping all &s;trangers from among&s;t them. If any &s;uch &s;hould by accident, or in his journey, ar|rive in the country of the mi&s;&s;ions, he is im|mediately carried to the pre&s;bytery, where he is treated for a day, or two at mo&s;t, with great ho&s;pitality, but regarded with no le&s;s circum&s;pection. The curio&s;ities of the place are &s;hewed him in company with the je&s;uit, and he can have no private conver&s;ation with any of the natives. In a rea&s;onable time he is civilly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with a guard to conduct him to the next di&s;trict, without expence, where he is treated in the &s;ame manner, until he is out of the country of the mi&s;&s;ions. Cau|tions altogether as &s;trict, and in the &s;ame &s;pirit, are ob&s;erved, when the natives are obliged to go out of their own territory to &s;erve in the king's works, or when any part of their troops are called out for his &s;ervice. They &s;hun all manner of conver&s;ation with &s;trangers, upon whom they look with a &s;ort of horror; and &s;o return, uninformed and untainted, into their own country as they left it.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that many have repre&s;ented the conduct of the je&s;uits in this mi&s;&s;ion in a very bad light; but their reflections appear to me not at all &s;upported by the facts upon which they build them. To judge perfectly of the &s;ervice they have done their people, we mu&s;t not con&s;ider them in a parallel with the flouri&s;hing nations of Europe, but as com|pared
<PB N="276" REF="286">
with their neighbours, the &s;avages of South America, or with the &s;tate of tho&s;e In|dians who groan under the Spani&s;h yoke. Con|&s;idering it in this, which is the true light, it will appear, that human &s;ociety is infinitely obliged to them for adding to it three hundred thou&s;and families in a well regulated com|munity, in the room of a few vagabond un|taught &s;avages. And indeed, it can &s;carce be conceived, that any government has not &s;ome extraordinary perfection, which has a prin|ciple of increa&s;e within it, which draws others to unite them&s;elves to the old &s;tock, and &s;hoots out it&s;elf a luxuriance of new branches. Neither can we, by any means, blame a &s;y&s;tem which produces &s;uch &s;alutary effects; and which has found that difficult, but happy way, that grand de&s;ideratum in politicks, of uniting a perfect &s;ubjection to an entire con|tent and &s;atisfaction of the people. Matters, which, it were to be wi&s;hed, were &s;tudied with more attention by us, who content our|&s;elves with railing at the diligence of an adver|&s;ary, which we &s;hould rather prai&s;e and imitate; and who in our affairs think of u&s;ing hardly any other in&s;truments than force or money.</P>
<P>This commonwealth has lately become a &s;ubject of much conver&s;ation, upon account of the ce&s;&s;ion which has lately been made of part of that territory to the crown of Portugal. It is well known, that the inhabitants of &s;even
<PB N="277" REF="287">
of the mi&s;&s;ions refu&s;ed to comply with this divi&s;ion, or to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be tran&s;|ferred from one hand to another, like cattle, without their own con&s;ent. How the je&s;uits have acquitted them&s;elves at the courts of Madrid and Li&s;bon upon this article, I do not know. We are informed by the authority of the gazette, that the Indians actually took up arms; but notwith&s;tanding the exactne&s;s of their di&s;cipline, they were ea&s;ily, and with a con&s;iderable &s;laughter, defeated by the Euro|pean troops, who were &s;ent to quell them. It &s;eems to have been ill-judged in this people, who had never &s;een any real &s;ervice, nor were headed by officers who had &s;een any, without which the be&s;t di&s;cipline is but a &s;ort of play, to have hazarded a battle with troops from Europe. They ought rather to have fir&s;t habituated them&s;elves to action by at|tacking &s;mall parties, by cutting off convoys, by little &s;urprizes, until by u&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s in &s;maller matters, they were intitled to hazard the &s;um of their affairs in the open field. How|ever, it is not improbable, that this oppo&s;ition will rou&s;e the indolence of the Spaniards, and make them take the government of the coun|try out of the hands it is in at pre&s;ent. If they do, it is not difficult to fore&s;ee, that the &s;ame depopulation, the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s, and the &s;ame di&s;content, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the In|dians in the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h provinces, will
<PB N="278" REF="288">
be &s;oon equally vi&s;ible in this. It will not be difficult for them to effect the reduction of this country; for the je&s;uits have too large and valuable an intere&s;t in Old Spain, as well as in the new world, to di&s;pute it with the court, whenever they &s;hall demand in good earne&s;t to have this country &s;urrendered; if it be true, that the je&s;uits have really &s;uch in|fluence on the inhabitants as is attributed to them.</P>
<P>It was not orginally &s;uch bad policy, as it may &s;eem, to have entru&s;ted the je&s;uits with &s;o great a power; &s;ince a little time will &s;hew, that they have given them a territory unknown, unpeopled, and uncultivated, which they have the certain means of repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing when they plea&s;e, &s;ubdued, peopled, and cultivated. As to it's wealth, it is hard to &s;ay any thing certain; the je&s;uits deny it. And truly if they acted with a perfect policy, they would never have &s;uffered any mines of gold or &s;ilver to be opened in that country. Of this matter I have no information upon which I can depend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Spaniards have not made any &s;et|tlements in the other divi&s;ions of South America, which they claim to the Southward of Buenos Ayres, nor to the Northward, ex|cept in Terra Firma, of which we &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething. The country of the Amazons, tho' prodigiou&s;ly large, wonderfully fertile, and watered by &s;o noble a river, is entirely ne|glected. The country of Patagonia is likewi&s;e of a va&s;t &s;tretch to the Southward of Buenos Ayres, all in the temperate zone, and extend|ed all along the Atlantic ocean; a plain coun|try without trees; but this is the ca&s;e of the delightful and fertile country of Buenos Ayres. It is &s;aid likewi&s;e to be barren and de&s;art; but what is certain, it is un&s;ettled by any European nation, and little known, though it lies open for any power that can avail it&s;elf of a favour|able opportunity to e&s;tabli&s;h a colony there.</P>
<P>The la&s;t province, according to the order I have ob&s;erved, tho' not of the lea&s;t con|&s;equence in the Spani&s;h American dominions, is Terra Firma; a va&s;t country, above 2000 miles in length, and 500 broad. Bordering on Mexico, Peru, and Amazonia, it &s;tretches all along the North &s;ea, from the Pacific ocean to the mouth of the river of Ama|zons upon the Atlantic. It is divided in|to
<PB N="280" REF="290">
twelve large provinces. They all contain a va&s;t deal of high and mountainous coun|try, particularly the province of St. Martha, where there are &s;aid to be hills &s;urpa&s;&s;ing Teneriffe it&s;elf in height; the&s;e hills com|municate with the Andes. The valleys are deep and narrow, and for a great part of the year flooded; but they are extremely fertile; produce corn enough; all kinds of the tropical fruits; rich drugs; cacao, va|nilla, indigo, piemento, guaiacum, &s;ar&s;apa|rilla, and bal&s;am of Peru. No country a|bounds more in rich and luxuriant pa&s;tu|rage, or has a greater &s;tock of excellent black cattle. Their rivers have rich golden &s;ands; their coa&s;ts have good pearl fi&s;heries; their mines yield great quantities of gold; and rubies and emeralds are found in plenty. Yet with all this fertility, Terra Firma is, for the greater part, the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant and mo&s;t unhealthful country of the torrid zone.</P>
<P>This province has a very con&s;iderable &s;hare of the trade of Europe; not only on ac|count of it's own produce and demand; but becau&s;e all the intercour&s;e of Peru and Chili with Old Spain, is carried on through this country. It's capital city Panama is the great barcadier of the South-Sea. Hither is brought all the trea&s;ure which the rich mines of Peru and Chili pay to the king, or produce upon a private account.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="291">The city of Panama is &s;ituated upon one of the be&s;t harbours in all re&s;pects, of the South-Seas. Ships of burthen lie &s;afe at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town; but &s;maller ve&s;&s;els come up to the walls. This town, one of the large&s;t in America, is &s;aid to con|tain five thou&s;and hou&s;es, elegantly built of brick and &s;tone, di&s;po&s;ed in a &s;emicircular form, and enlivened with the &s;pires and domes of many &s;plendid churches and rich mona&s;|teries. It is covered on the land &s;ide with fine orchards and gardens, and at a greater di&s;tance with an agreeable country, diver&s;ified with hills, valleys, and woods. The town &s;tands upon a dry and healthful ground, and has a great and profitable trade with Peru, Chili, and the We&s;tern coa&s;t of Mexico upon one &s;ide, and with the Terra Firma, and with Europe on the other, which is carried on over the i&s;thmus of Darien, and by the river Chagra.</P>
<P>The &s;econd town of con&s;ideration in Terra Firma, is Carthagena, which &s;tands upon a penin&s;ula, that enclo&s;es one of the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t defended harbours in all the Spani&s;h America. The town it&s;elf is well fortified, and built after the elegant fa&s;hion of mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h American towns, with a &s;quare in the middle, and &s;treets running every way re|gularly from it, and others cutting the&s;e at right angles. This town has many rich
<PB N="282" REF="292">
churches and convents; that of the je&s;uits is particularly magnificent. Here it is that the galleons on their voyage from Spain put in fir&s;t, and di&s;po&s;e of a con&s;iderable part of their cargo; which from hence is di&s;tributed to St. Martha, the Caraccas, Venezuela, and mo&s;t of the other provinces and towns in the Terra Firma.</P>
<P>The fleet which is called the galleons, con&s;i&s;ts of about eight men of war, of about fifty guns each, de&s;igned principally to &s;upply Peru with military &s;tores; but in reality, laden not only with the&s;e, but with every other kind of merchandize on a private account; &s;o as to be in bad condition for defending them|&s;elves, or protecting others. Under the con|voy of the&s;e &s;ail about twelve merchant &s;hips, not inferior in burthen. This fleet of the gal|leons is regulated in much the &s;ame manner with the flotas, and it is de&s;tined for the exclu|&s;ive commerce of Terra Firma and the South-Sea, as the flota is for that of Mexico.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner is this fleet arrived in the haven of Carthagena, than expre&s;&s;es are immediately di&s;patched to Portobello, and to all the adja|cent towns; but principally to Panama; that they may get ready all the trea&s;ure which is depo&s;ited there, to meet the galleons at Portobello; at which town, (remarkable for the goodne&s;s of it's harbour, which brings &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing concour&s;e here at the time of the fair, and the unwhol&s;omene&s;s of the air,
<PB N="283" REF="293">
which makes it a de&s;art at all other times) all the per&s;ons concerned in the various branches of this exten&s;ive traffic a&s;&s;emble; and there is certainly no part of the world where bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch great importance is negotiated in &s;o &s;hort a time. For in about a fortnight the fair is over; during which the di&s;play of the gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones, on the one hand, and of all the curio&s;ity and variety of the ingenious fabrics of Europe on the other, is a&s;toni&s;hing. Heaps of wedges and ingots of &s;ilver are tumbled about on the wharfs like common things. At this time an hundred crowns are given for a poor lodging, a thou|&s;and for a &s;hop, and provi&s;ion of every kind is proportionably dear; which may help us to &s;ome idea of the profits made in this trade. The trea&s;ure is brought hither from Panama, by a very dangerous road upon mules. The other goods, &s;ugar, tobacco, and drugs, are tran&s;ported on the river Chagra.</P>
<P>When the galleons have taken in their re|turns, they &s;teer together to the Havanna, which is the place of rendezvous of all the &s;hips concerned in the Spani&s;h American trade.</P>
<P>The Havanna is the capital city of the i&s;land of Cuba. It is &s;ituated upon an ex|cellent harbour upon the We&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land. This city is large, containing not le&s;s than two thou&s;and hou&s;es, with a
<PB N="284" REF="294">
number of churches and convents; but then it is the only place of con&s;equence upon the noble i&s;land of Cuba, which lies in the latitude 20, and extends from Ea&s;t to We&s;t near &s;even hundred miles in length, though in breadth it is di&s;proportioned, being but from one hundred and twenty to &s;eventy miles. However, it yields to no part of the We&s;t-Indies in the fertility of it's &s;oil, or in excel|lence of every thing which is produced in that climate. But the Spaniards, by a &s;eries of the mo&s;t inhuman and impolitic barbarities, having exterminated the original inhabitants; and not finding the quantities of gold in the i&s;lands which the continent afforded, they have left this as well as Hi&s;paniola; of which the French now po&s;&s;e&s;s the greater part, and Porto Rico, a large, excellent, and fertile i&s;land, comparatively &s;o many de&s;arts. The commerce between the&s;e i&s;lands, and the Spani&s;h continent, is carried on by the Barle|vento fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix &s;hips of good burthen and force, who annually make the tour of all the&s;e i&s;lands, and the coa&s;t of Terra Firma, not only to carry on the commerce between tho&s;e places, but to clear the &s;ea of pirates and illicit traders. Now and then a regi&s;ter &s;hip from Old Spain is bound to one or other of the&s;e i&s;lands. Hitherto the Spa|niards &s;eemed rather to keep them, to prevent any other nation from growing too powerful
<PB N="285" REF="295">
in tho&s;e &s;eas, than for any profit they expected to derive from them. And it is certain, that if other nations &s;hould come entirely to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole of the i&s;lands, the trade of the American continent, and perhaps the continent it&s;elf, would be entirely at their mercy. How|ever, of late, the Spaniards have taken &s;ome &s;teps towards the better &s;ettlement of Porto Rico. They are beginning to open the Ame|rican trade to &s;ome other towns in Spain be|&s;ides Cadiz. They have made a difference in point of duty between their own manufactures and tho&s;e of foreigners. They are, in &s;hort, opening their eyes to the true intere&s;t of their country, and moving their hands, though &s;lowly, to promote it.</P>
<P>Unto this time, the tide of wealth, that con&s;tantly flowed from America into Spain, ran through that kingdom like a ha&s;ty torrent, which, far from enriching the country, hurried away with it all the wealth which it found in it's pa&s;&s;age. No country in Europe receives &s;uch va&s;t trea&s;ures as Spain. In no country in Europe is &s;een &s;o little money. The truth is, from the time that the Indies fell into the hands of Spain, the affairs of that monarchy have been con&s;tantly going backward. In America their &s;ettlements were carried on conformably to that genius, and to tho&s;e maxims, which prevailed in their government in Europe. No means of retaining their con|que&s;ts
<PB N="286" REF="296">
but by extirpating the people; no &s;chemes for the advancement of trade; no attempts at the reformation of abu&s;es, which became venerable in proportion to the mi&s;|chiefs they had &s;uffered by them. In govern|ment, tyranny; in religion, bigotry; in trade, monopoly.</P>
<P>When the Spaniards found, to their am|bition which was boundle&s;s, that they had joined a trea&s;ure which was inexhau&s;tible, they imagined there was nothing too va&s;t for them to compa&s;s. They embraced a thou&s;and projects at once; many of them noble ones in theory, but to be executed with different in|&s;truments in different parts of the world, and all at a va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure. The wars, which were the re&s;ult of the&s;e &s;chemes, and the Indies, which were to &s;up|port them, were a continual drain, which car|ried off their people, and de&s;troyed all in|du&s;try in tho&s;e who remained. The trea&s;ure which flowed in every year from the new world, found them in debt to every part of the old; for to the re&s;t of their revenues they had forgot to add that, which is a great re|venue it&s;elf, and the great &s;upport of all the others, oeconomy. On the contrary, an ill order in their finances at home, and a de|vouring u&s;ury abroad, &s;wallowed up all their trea&s;ure, whil&s;t they multiplied the occa&s;ions for it. With the be&s;t &s;cheming heads in
<PB N="287" REF="297">
Europe, they were every where outwitted; with the brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops, they were almo&s;t always defeated; with the greate&s;t trea&s;ures, they were in want; and their armies were ill provided, and ill paid. Their friends exhau&s;ted them by trade; their enemies by plunder. They &s;aw new &s;tates ari&s;e out of the fragments of their dominions; and new maritime powers &s;tart up from the wrecks of their navy. In &s;hort, they pro|voked, troubled, and enriched all Europe; and at la&s;t de&s;i&s;ted through mere want of &s;trength. They were inactive, but not quiet; and they were enervated as much by their lazine&s;s during this repo&s;e, as they had been weakened before by their ill-judged activity.</P>
<P>All this happened in a country, which abounded with men of capacity as much as any &s;tate in Europe, and often with men of great capacity at it's head. But their talents took a wrong turn; their politics were al|ways more abroad than at home; more em|ployed in weakening their neighbours, than in &s;trengthening them&s;elves. They were wi&s;e in the concerns of foreign courts; they were &s;atisfied with being formal in their own do|me&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s. They relied too much upon their riches; and the whble &s;tate, being mould|ed into a &s;y&s;tem of corruption from the top to the bottom, things grew at la&s;t &s;o bad, that the evils them&s;elves became a &s;ort of remedies;
<PB N="288" REF="298">
and they felt &s;o &s;everely the con&s;equences of their former conduct, that they have for &s;ome years pa&s;t turned their thoughts into a very good channel; and they may in time, and with per&s;everance, ri&s;e again, whil&s;t others &s;hall fall, by adopting the abu&s;es which brought them to ruin.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent the politics of Spain, with re|gard to America, &s;eem to be; to pre&s;erve South America, and particularly the naviga|tion of the South-Seas, as much as po&s;&s;ible to them&s;elves; to de&s;troy effectually the counterband trade, and to encourage the ex|port of their own manufactures. Of us they have long &s;hewn a remarkable jealou&s;y; a much greater than of the French, whom they &s;ee quietly &s;ettling in the neighbourhood of New Mexico; and who are growing certainly in the We&s;t-Indies in a far greater degree than we are.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT is very rare that any material di&s;covery, whether in the arts, in philo&s;ophy, or in navigation, has been owing to efforts made di|rctly for that partreicular purpo&s;e, and deter|mined by the force of rea&s;onings <HI>a priori.</HI> The fir&s;t hints are owing to accident; and di&s;coveries in one kind pre&s;ent them&s;elves voluntarily to us, whil&s;t we are in &s;earch of what flies from us in &s;ome other. The di&s;covery of America by Columbus was owing originally to a ju&s;t rea|&s;oning on the figure of the earth; though the particular land he di&s;covered was far enough from that which he &s;ought. Here was a mixture of wi&s;e de&s;ign and fortunate accident; but the Portugue&s;e di&s;covery of Brazil may be con&s;idered as merely accidental. For &s;ailing
<PB N="290" REF="300">
with a con&s;iderable armament to India, by the way of the Cape of Good Hope, but &s;tanding out to &s;ea to avoid the calms upon the coa&s;t of Africa, the Portugue&s;e fleet fell in upon the continent of South America. Upon their return they made &s;o favourable a report of the land they had di&s;covered, that the court re|&s;olved to &s;end a colony thither. And accord|ingly made their fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment; but in a very bad method, in which it were to be wi&s;hed they had never been imitated. This was by bani&s;hing thither a number of criminals of all kinds. This blended an evil di&s;po&s;ition with the fir&s;t principles of the colony, and made the &s;ettlement infinitely difficult by the di&s;orders in&s;eperable from &s;uch people, and the offence which they gave the original inhabitants. This &s;ettlement met &s;ome interruption too from the court of Spain, who con&s;idered the country as within their dominions. However, matters were accommodated by a treaty, in which it was agreed, that the Portugue&s;e &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s all that tract of land that lies be|tween the river Maranon, or of the Amazons, and the river Plate.</P>
<P>When their right was thus confirmed, the Portugue&s;e pur&s;ued the &s;ettlement with great vigour. Large grants were made to tho&s;e who were inclined to become adventurers; and almo&s;t all the nobility of Portugal proured intere&s;ts in a country which promi&s;ed &s;uch
<PB N="291" REF="301">
great advantages. The natives were in mo&s;t parts &s;ubdued, and the improvement of the colony advanced apace. The crown in a little time became attentive to &s;o valuable an acqui&s;ition; the government was new mo|delled, many of the exorbitant grants recalled, and all things &s;ettled upon &s;o advantageous a footing, that the whole &s;ea coa&s;t, upwards of two thou&s;and miles, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ettled, to the honour of the indu&s;try and courage of the fir&s;t planters, and infinitely to the benefit of the mother country. The Portugue&s;e conque&s;ts on the coa&s;t of Africa forwarded this e&s;tabli&s;hment, by the number of negroes it afforded them for their works; and this was the fir&s;t introduction of negroes into America, of which at pre&s;ent they form a large part of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the very meridian of their pro&s;perity, when the Portugue&s;e were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o exten&s;ive an empire, and &s;o flouri&s;hing a trade in Africa, in Arabia, in India, in the i&s;les of A&s;ia, and in one of the mo&s;t valuable parts of America, they were &s;truck down by one of tho&s;e incidents, that at one blow, in a critical time, decides the fate of kingdoms. Don Seba&s;tian, one of their greate&s;t princes, in an expedition he had undertaken again&s;t the Moors, lo&s;t his life; and by that accident the Portugue&s;e lo&s;t their liberty, being ab&s;orbed into the Spani&s;h dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="302">Soon after this misfortune, the &s;ame yoke that galled the Portugue&s;e, grew &s;o intolerable to the inhabitants of the Netherlands, that they threw it off with great fury and indigna|tion. Not &s;atisfied with erecting them&s;elves into an independent &s;tate, and &s;upporting their independency by a &s;ucce&s;sful defen&s;ive war, flu&s;hed with the juvenile ardor of a growing commonwealth, they pur&s;ued the Spaniards into the remote&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their exten&s;ive territories, and grew rich, powerful, and ter|rible, by the &s;poils of their former ma&s;ters. Principally, they fell upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Portugue&s;e; they took almo&s;t all their fortre&s;&s;es in the Ea&s;t-Indies, not &s;ufficiently defended by the inert policy of the court of Spain; and then turned their arms upon Brazil, unprotected from Europe, and betrayed by the cowardice of the governor of the then principal city. And they would have overrun the whole, if Don Michael de Texeira, the archbi&s;hop, de&s;cended from one of the noble&s;t families in Portugal, and of a &s;pirit &s;uperior to his birth, had not believed, that in &s;uch an emergency, the danger of his country &s;uper&s;eded the com|mon obligations of his profe&s;&s;ion. He took arms, and at the head of his monks, and a few &s;cattered forces, put a &s;top to the torrent of the Dutch conque&s;t.

and his own virtue had armed him, into the hands of a per&s;on appointed by authority. By this &s;tand he &s;aved &s;even of the captain&s;hips, or provinces, out of fourteen, into which Brazil is divided; the re&s;t fell into the hands of the Dutch, who conquered and kept them with a bravery and conduct, which would de+&s;erve more applau&s;e; if it had been governed by humanity.</P>
<P>The famous captain, prince Maurice of Na&s;&s;au, was the per&s;on to whom the Dutch owed this conque&s;t, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their colony there, and that advantageous peace which &s;ecured them in it. But as it is the genius of all mercantile people to de&s;ire a &s;udden profit in all their de&s;igns; and as this colony was not under the immediate in&s;pection of the States, but &s;ubject to the company called the We&s;t-India company, from principles narrowed up by avarice and mean notions, they grudged that the pre&s;ent profits of the colony &s;hould be &s;acrificed to it's future &s;ecurity. They found, that the prince kept up more troops, and erected more fortre&s;&s;es, than they thought nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;afety; and that he lived in a grander manner than they thought be|came one in their &s;ervice. They imagined that a little official oeconomy was the principal quality nece&s;&s;ary to form a great conqueror and politician; and therefore they were highly di&s;plea&s;ed with their governor prince Maurice,
<PB N="294" REF="304">
whom they treated in &s;uch a manner as obliged him to re&s;ign.</P>
<P>Now their own &s;chemes took place. A reduction of the troops; the expence of forti|cations &s;aved; the charge of a court retrench|ed; the debts of the company &s;trictly exacted; their gains increa&s;ed cent per cent, and every thing flouri&s;hing according to their be&s;t ideas of a flouri&s;hing state. But then, all this fine &s;y&s;tem in a &s;hort time ended in the total lo&s;s of all their capital, and the entire ruin of the We&s;t-India company. The hearts of &s;ubjects were lo&s;t by their penurious way of dealing, and the &s;everity of their proceedings. The enemy in their neighbourhood was en|couraged by the defencele&s;s &s;tate of their frontiers, and both operated in &s;uch a manner, that Brazil was reconquered by the Portu|gue&s;e; though after a &s;truggle, in which the States exerted them&s;elves vigorously; but with that aggravated expence, and that ill &s;ucce&s;s, which always attends a late wi&s;dom, and the patching up a blundering &s;y&s;tem of conduct. A &s;tanding le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e people who have the folly to imagine they con&s;ult the happine&s;s of a nation, when by a pretended tenderne&s;s for &s;ome of it's advantages, they neglect the only things that can &s;upport it, the cultivating the good opinion of the people, and the keep|ing up a proper force.</P>

<P>THE name of Brazil was given to this country, becau&s;e it was ob&s;erved to abound with a wood of that name. It extends all along a tract of fine &s;ea coa&s;t upon the Atlantic ocean upwards of two thou&s;and miles, between the river of Amazons on the North, and that of Plate on the South. To the Northward the climate is uncertain, hot, boi&s;terous, and un|whol&s;ome. The country, both there, and even in more temperate parts, is annually over|flowed. But to the Southward, beyond the tropic of Capricorn, and indeed a good way within it, there is no part of the world that enjoys a more &s;erene and whol&s;ome air; refre&s;hed with the &s;oft breezes of the ocean on one hand, and the cool breath of the moun|tains on the other. Hither &s;everal aged people from Portugal retire for their health, and protract their lives to a long and ea&s;y age.</P>
<P>In general, the &s;oil is extremely fruitful, and was found very &s;ufficient for the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the inhabitants, until the mines of gold and diamonds were di&s;covered. The&s;e, with the &s;ugar plantations, occupy &s;o many hands, that agriculture lies neglected; and in con&s;equence Brazil depends upon Europe for it's daily bread.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="306">The chief commodities which this country yields for a foreign market are, &s;ugar, tobacco, hides, indigo, ipecacuanha, bal&s;am of Copaibo, and brazil wood. The la&s;t article, as it in a more particular manner belongs to this coun|try, to which it gives it's name, and which produces it in the greate&s;t perfection, it is not ami&s;s to allow a very little room to the de&s;cription of it. This tree generally flouri&s;hes in rocky and barren grounds, in which it grows to a great height, and con&s;iderable thickne&s;s. But a man who judges of the quantity of the timber, by the thickne&s;s of the tree, will be much deceived; for upon &s;tripping off the bark, which makes a very large part of the plant, he will find from a tree as thick as his body, a log no more in compa&s;s than his leg. This tree is generally crooked, and knotty like the hawthorn, with long branches, and a &s;mooth green leaf, hard, dry, and brittle. Thrice a year bunches of &s;mall flowers &s;hoot out at the extremities of the branches, and between the leaves. The&s;e flowers are of a bright red, and of a &s;trong aromatic and refre&s;hing &s;mell. The wood of this tree is of a red colour, hard and dry. It is u&s;ed chiefly in dying red, but not a red of the be&s;t kind; and it has &s;ome place in medicine as a &s;tomachic and re&s;tringent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP III,</HEAD>
<P>THE trade of Brazil is very great, and it increa&s;es every year. Nor is this a wonder; &s;ince they have opportunities of &s;up|plying them&s;elves with &s;laves for their &s;everal works, at a much ea&s;ier and cheaper rate than any other European power, which has &s;ettle|ments in America. For they are the only European nation which has taken the pains to e&s;tabli&s;h colonies in Africa. Tho&s;e of the Portugue&s;e are very con&s;iderable, both for their extent and the numbers of their inhabi|tants; and of cour&s;e they have advantages in that trade which no other nation can have. For be&s;ides their large e&s;tabli&s;hment on the West|ern &s;hore of Africa, they claim the whole coa&s;t of Zanguebar on the Ea&s;tern &s;ide, which in part they po&s;&s;e&s;s; be&s;ides &s;everal other large terri|tories, both on the coa&s;t and in the country; where &s;everal numerous nations acknowledge them&s;elves their dependants or &s;ubjects. This is not only of great advantage to them, as it increa&s;es their &s;hipping and &s;eamen, and &s;trengthens their commercial reputation, but as it leaves them a large field for their &s;lave trade; without which, they could hardly ever &s;upply, upon any tolerable terms, their &s;ettle|ments in Brazil, which carry off &s;uch numbers by the &s;everity of the works, and the un|whol&s;omene&s;s
<PB N="298" REF="308">
of &s;ome part of the climate; nor could they otherwi&s;e extend their planta|tions, and open &s;o many new mines as they do, to a degree which is a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P>I own I have often been &s;urprized, that our African traders &s;hould chu&s;e &s;o contracted an object for their &s;lave trade, which extends to little more than &s;ome part of the Gold coa&s;t, to Sierra Leone, and Gambia, and &s;ome other incon&s;iderable ports; by which they have depreciated their own commodities, and rai&s;ed the price of &s;laves within the&s;e few years above thirty per cent. Nor is it to be wondered; as in the tract, in which they trade, they have many rivals; the people are grown too expert by the con&s;tant habit of European commerce; and the &s;laves in that part are in a good mea&s;ure exhau&s;ted; whereas, if &s;ome of our ve&s;&s;els pa&s;&s;ed the Cape of Good Hope, and tried what might be done in Madaga&s;car,or on tho&s;e coa&s;ts which indeed the Portugue&s;e claim, but do not, nor cannot hold, there is no doubt but that they would find the greater expence and length of time in pa&s;&s;ing the Cape, or the charge of licences which might be procured from the Ea&s;t-India company, amply compen&s;ated. Our African trade might then be con&s;iderably en|larged, our own manufactures extended, and our colonies &s;upplied at an ea&s;ier rate than they are at pre&s;ent, or are likely to be for the
<PB N="299" REF="309">
future, whil&s;t we confine our&s;elves to two or three places, which we exhau&s;t, and where we &s;hall find the market dearer every day. The Portugue&s;e from the&s;e &s;ettlements, and this exten&s;ive range, draw every year into Brazil between forty and fifty thou&s;and &s;laves. On this trade all their other depends, and therefore they take great care to have it well &s;upplied, for which purpo&s;e the &s;ituation of Brazil, nearer the coa&s;t of Africa than any other part of America, is very convenient; and it co-operates with the great advantages they derive from having colonies in both places.</P>
<P>Hence it is principally, that Brazil is the riche&s;t, mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, and mo&s;t growing e&s;tabli&s;hment in all America. Their export of &s;ugar within forty years is grown much greater than it was, though anciently it made almo&s;t the whole of their exportable produce, and they were without rivals in the trade. It is finer in kind than what any of ours, the French, or Spani&s;h &s;ugar plantations &s;end us. Their tobacco too is remarkably good, though not rai&s;ed in &s;o large a quantity as in our colo|nies. The Northern and Southern part of Brazil abounds in horned cattle; the&s;e are hunted for their hides, of which no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and are &s;ent annually into Eu|rope.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e were a con&s;iderable time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their American empire, before
<PB N="300" REF="310">
they di&s;covered the trea&s;ures of gold and dia|monds, which have &s;ince made it &s;o con&s;ider|able. After the expul&s;ion of the Dutch, the colony remained without much attention from the court of Portugal; until in 1685, a mini&s;ter of great &s;agacity advi&s;ed the then monarch to turn his thoughts to &s;o valuable and con&s;iderable a part of his territories. He repre&s;ented to him, that the climate in the bay of All Saints, where the capital &s;tood, was of &s;uch a nature as to deaden the activity and indu&s;try of the people; but that the Northern and Southern extremities of Brazil in a more temperate climate, invited them to the cultivation of the country. The ad|vice was taken. But becau&s;e it was found that the in&s;olence and tyranny of the na|tive Portugue&s;e always excited the hatred of the native Brazilians, and con&s;equently ob|&s;tructed the &s;ettlements, they were re&s;olved to people the countries, which were now the object of their care, with tho&s;e who are called Me&s;tizes; that is, a race &s;prung from a mixture of Europeans and Indians, who they judged would behave better; and who, on account of their connection in blood, would be more acceptable to the Brazilians on the borders, who were not yet reduced. To compleat this de&s;ign, they ve&s;ted the govern|ment in the hands of prie&s;ts, who acted each as governor in his own pari&s;h or di&s;trict. And
<PB N="301" REF="311">
they had the prudence to chu&s;e with great care &s;uch men as were proper for the work. The con&s;equence of the&s;e wi&s;e regulations was &s;oon apparent; for without noi&s;e or force, in fifteen years they not only &s;ettled the &s;ea coa&s;t, but drawing in va&s;t numbers of the natives, they &s;pread them&s;elves above an hundred miles more to the We&s;tward than the Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements had ever before extended. They opened &s;everal mines, which improved the revenues; the planters were ea&s;y, and &s;everal of the prie&s;ts made no incon|&s;iderable fortunes.</P>
<P>The fame of the&s;e new mines drew toge|ther a number of de&s;peradoes and adventurers of all nations and colours, who not agreeing with the moderate and &s;imple manners of the inhabitants of the new &s;ettlements, nor readily &s;ubmitting to any order or re&s;traint el&s;ewhere, retired into a mountainous part of the country, but fertile enough, and rich in gold; where, by the acce&s;&s;ion of others in their own cir|cum&s;tances, they &s;oon became a formidable and independent body, and for a long time defend|ed the privileges they had a&s;&s;umed with great courage and policy. They were called Pauli&s;ts, from the town and di&s;trict called St. Paul, which was their head quarters. But as this odd commonwealth grew up in &s;o unccount|able a manner, &s;o it peri&s;hed in a manner alto|gether unknown in this part of the world. It
<PB N="302" REF="312">
is now heard of no longer. The king of Portu|gal is in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole country; and the mines are worked by his &s;ubjects and their &s;laves, paying him a fifth. The&s;e mines have poured almo&s;t as much gold into Europe as the Spani&s;h America had of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Not many years after the di&s;covery of the gold mines, Brazil, which for a century had been given up as a place incapable of yielding the metals for which America was chiefly valued, was now found to produce diamonds too; but at fir&s;t of &s;o unpromi&s;ing a nature, that the working of the mines was forbidden by the court of Portugal, le&s;t without making any compen&s;ation by their number, they might depreciate the trade which was carried on in the&s;e &s;tones from Goa. But in &s;pite of this prohibition, a number were from time to time &s;muggled from Brazil; and &s;ome too of &s;uch great weight, and high lu&s;tre, and tran&s;parency, that they yielded very little to the fine&s;t brought from India. The court now perceived the importance of the trade, and accordingly re&s;olved to permit it, but under &s;uch re&s;trictions as might be &s;ufficiently beneficial to the crown and &s;ubject; and at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve the jewels in that &s;carcity which makes the principal part of their value. In 1740 the diamond mines were farmed at one hundred and thirty-eight thou|&s;and cru&s;adoes, or about twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and
<PB N="303" REF="313">
pounds &s;terling annually, with a prohibition again&s;t employing more than &s;ix hundred &s;lave at a time in the works. It is pro|bable that this regulation is not very &s;trictly complied with, the quantity of diamonds is much increa&s;ed, and their value of cour&s;e &s;unk &s;ince that time. It is true, that diamonds of the very fir&s;t rank are nearly as dear as ever. None of the diamonds of Brazil have &s;o high a lu&s;tre as the fir&s;t rate of Gol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nda; and they have generally &s;ome|thing of a du&s;ky yellowi&s;h ca&s;t; but they have been found of a prodigious &s;ize. Some years ago we had an account in the news papers of one &s;ent to the king of Portugal, of a &s;ize and weight almo&s;t beyond the bounds of credibility; for it was &s;aid to weigh &s;ixteen hundred carats, or &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred and twenty grains; and con&s;equently mu&s;t be worth &s;everal millions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE trade of Portugal is carried on upon the &s;ame exclu&s;ive plan, on which the &s;everal nations of Europe trade with their colonies of America; and it more particularly re&s;embles the Spani&s;h method, by &s;ending out not &s;ingle &s;hips, as the convenien|cy of the &s;everal places, and the ideas of the European merchants may direct; but by an|nual fleets which &s;ail at &s;tated times from Portugal, and compo&s;e three flotas bound to as many ports in Brazil; to Fernambucca, in the Northern part; Rio Janeiro, at the Southern extremity; and the bay of All Saints in the middle. In this la&s;t is the capital, which is called St. Salvador, where all the fleets rendezvous on their return to Portugal. This city commands a noble, &s;pa|cious, and commodious harbour. It is built upon an high and &s;teep rock, having the &s;ea upon one &s;ide, and a lake forming a cre&s;cent, inve&s;ting it almo&s;t wholly, &s;o as nearly to join the &s;ea on the other. This &s;ituation makes it in a manner impregnable by nature; but they have be&s;ides added to it very &s;trong fortifications. All the&s;e make it the &s;tronge&s;t place in America. It is divided into an up|per and lower town. The lower con&s;i&s;ts only of a &s;treet or two, immediately upon the har|bour,
<PB N="305" REF="315">
for the convenience of lading and un|lading goods, which are drawn up to the higher town by machines. The &s;treets in the upper town are laid out as regularly as the ground will admit, and are hand&s;omely built. They had forty years ago in this city above two thou&s;and hou&s;es, and inhabitants proportionable; a &s;umptuous cathedral; &s;eve|ral magnificent churches; and many convents, well built and endowed. The Portugue&s;e fleet &s;ets out from Li&s;bon in it's voyage hither in the month of February.</P>
<P>I can get no accounts, preci&s;e enough to be depended upon, of the towns of Fernambucca, or Parayba, and the capital of the Rio de Janeiro, to enable me to be particular about them. Let it &s;uffice that the fleet for the former of the&s;e &s;ets outs in March; and for the latter in the month of January; but they all rendezvous in the bay of All Saints, to the number of an hundred &s;ail of large &s;hips, about the month of May or June, and carry to Europe a cargo little inferior in value to the trea&s;ures of the flota and galleons. The gold alone amounts to near four millions &s;terling. This is not all extracted from the mines of Brazil; but as they carry on a large direct trade with Africa, they bring, e&s;pecially from their &s;ettlement at Mozambique, on the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of that con|tinent be&s;ides their &s;laves, va&s;t quantities of gold, ebony and ivory, which goes into the amount
<PB N="306" REF="316">
of the cargo of the Brazil fleets for Europe. Tho&s;e parts of Brazil which yield gold, are the middle and Northern parts on the Rio Janeiro and Bay of All Saints. They coin a great deal of the gold in America; that which is coined at Rio Janeiro bears an R, that which is &s;truck at the Bay is marked with a B.</P>
<P>To judge the better of the riches of this Brazil fleet, the diamonds it contains mu&s;t not be forgot. For if the mines rented to the crown in the year 1740, at twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year, it will be a very &s;mall allowance to &s;ay, that at lea&s;t five times more is made out of them; and that there is returned to Europe in diamonds to at lea&s;t the value of one hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds. This, with the &s;ugar, which is principally the cargo of the Fernambucca fleet, the tobacco, the hides, the valuable drugs for medicine and manufactures, may give &s;ome idea of the importance of this trade, not only to Portugal, but to all the trading powers of Europe. The returns are not the fiftieth part of the produce of Portugal. They con&s;i&s;t of the woollen goods of all kinds of England, France, and Holland, the linens and laces of Holland, France, and Germany; the &s;ilks of France and Italy; lead, tin, iron, copper, and all &s;orts of uten|&s;ils wrought in the&s;e metals from England; as
<PB N="307" REF="317">
well as &s;alt-fi&s;h, beef, flour, and chee&s;e. Oil they have from Spain. Wine, with &s;ome fruits, is nearly all with which they are &s;up|plied from Portugal.</P>
<P>Though the profits in this trade are great, very few Portugue&s;e merchants trade upon their own &s;tocks; they are generally credited by the foreign merchants, who&s;e commodi|ties they vend, e&s;pecially the Engli&s;h. In &s;hort, though in Portugal, as in Spain, all trade with their plantations is &s;trictly inter|dicted to &s;trangers; yet, like all regulations that contradict the very nature of the object they regard, they are here as little attended to as in Spain. The Portugue&s;e is only the tru&s;tee and factor; but his fidelity is equal to that of the Spani&s;h merchant; and that has &s;carce ever been &s;haken by any public or private cau&s;e what&s;oever. A thing &s;urpri&s;ing in the Portugue&s;e; and a &s;triking in&s;tance among&s;t a people &s;o far from remarkable for their integrity, of what a cu&s;tom ori|ginally built upon a few examples, and a con&s;equent reputation built upon that, will be able to effect in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men of very different natural characters and morals. And &s;o different is the &s;pirit of commercial hone&s;ty from that of ju&s;tice, as it is an in|dependent virtue, and influences the heart.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h at pre&s;ent are the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ted, both in the trade of Portugal for home
<PB N="308" REF="318">
con&s;umption, and of what they want for the u&s;e of the Brazils. And they de&s;erve to be mo&s;t favoured, as well from the &s;ervices they have always done that crown, and from the &s;tipulations of treaties, as from the con&s;idera|tion that no other people con&s;umes &s;o much of the products of Portugal. However, partly from our own &s;upinene&s;s, partly from the policy and activity of France, and partly from the fault of the Portugue&s;e them&s;elves, the French have become very dangerous ri|vals to us in this, as in mo&s;t other branches of our trade. It is true, that though the French have advanced &s;o prodigiou&s;ly, and that there is a &s;pirit of indu&s;try and commerce rai&s;ed in mo&s;t countries in Europe, our exports of manufactures, or natural products, have by no means le&s;&s;ened within the&s;e la&s;t forty years; which can only be explained by the extending our own, and the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e co|lonies, which increa&s;es the general demand. But though it be true, that we have rather ad|vanced than declined in our commerce upon the whole, yet we ought to take great care not to be deceived by this appearance. For if we have not likewi&s;e advanced in as great a pro|portion to what we were before that period, and to our means &s;ince then, as our neighbours have done in proportion to theirs, as I appre|hend we have not, then, I &s;ay, we have comparatively declined; and &s;hall never be
<PB N="309" REF="319">
able to pre&s;erve that great &s;uperiority in com|merce, and that di&s;tingui&s;hed rank of the fir&s;t commercial and maritime power in Eu|rope, time mu&s;t be e&s;&s;ential to pre&s;erve us in any degree, either of commerce or power. For if any other power of a more exten&s;ive and populous territory than ours, &s;hould come to rival us in trade and wealth, he mu&s;t come of nece&s;&s;ity to give law to us in whatever relates either to trade or policy. Not|with&s;tanding that, the want of capacity in the mini&s;ters of &s;uch a power, or the indolence of the &s;overeign, may protract the evil for a time, it will certainly be felt in the end, and will &s;hew us demon&s;tratively, though too late, that we mu&s;t have a great &s;uperiority in trade, not only to our&s;elves formerly, but to our neighbours at pre&s;ent, to have any at all which is likely to continue with us for a long time.</P>

<P>THE pourtrait which the mo&s;t judi|cious travellers give us of the manners and cu&s;toms of the Portugue&s;e in America, is very far from being favourable to that people. They are repre&s;ented as a people at once &s;unk into the mo&s;t effeminate luxury, and practi&s;ing the mo&s;t de&s;perate crimes. Of a di&s;&s;embling hypocritical temper; of little hone&s;ty in deal|ing, or &s;incerity in conver&s;ation; lazy, proud,
<PB N="310" REF="320">
and cruel. They are poor and penurious in their diet, not more through nece&s;&s;ity than inclination. For, like the inhabitants of mo&s;t Southern climates, they are much more fond of &s;hew, &s;tate, and attendance, than of the joys of free &s;ociety, and the &s;atisfactions of a good table, Yet their fea&s;ts, &s;eldom made, are &s;umptuous to extravagance.</P>
<P>The luxury, indolence, pride, and cruelty of the ma&s;ters, has, among&s;t other cau&s;es, been very ju&s;tly attributed to their being bred up among&s;t &s;laves, having every bu&s;ine&s;s entirely done by &s;uch; and to their being permitted to keep a prodigious number of negroes, not for their field work, nor for do|me&s;tic employments, but merely to wait upon them, and to form their train. The&s;e be|come more corrupted than their ma&s;ters, who make them the in&s;truments of their crimes; and giving them an unbounded and &s;canda|lous licence, employ them whenever they want to terrify or revenge, as bullies and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. And indeed nothing can be con|ceived more fit to create the wor&s;t di&s;orders, than the unnatural junction of &s;lavery to idle|ne&s;s, and a licentious way of living. They are all &s;uffered to go armed, and there are va&s;t numbers who have merited or bought their freedom; and this is &s;uffered in a coun|try where the negroes are ten to one.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="321">But this picture, perhaps too highly coloured for tho&s;e whom it is intended to repre&s;ent, is by no means applicable to all the Portugue&s;e of Brazil. Tho&s;e by the Rio Janeiro, and in the Northern captain&s;hips, are not near &s;o effeminate and corrupted as tho&s;e of the Bay of All Saints, which being in a climate fa|vourable to indolence and debauchery, the capital city, and one of the olde&s;t &s;ettlements, is in all re&s;pects wor&s;e than any of the others.</P>
<P>The government of Brazil is in the viceroy, who re&s;ides at St. Salvador. He has two councils, one for criminal, the other for civil affairs; in both which he pre&s;ides. But, to the infinite prejudice of the &s;ettlement, all the delay, chicanery, and multiplied expences incident to the wor&s;t part of the law, and practi&s;ed by the mo&s;t corrupted lawyers, flouri&s;h here; at the &s;ame time that ju&s;tice is &s;o lax, that the greate&s;t crimes often pa&s;s with impunity. Formerly the judges could not legally puni&s;h any Portugue&s;e with death. And it is not difficult to imagine, how much &s;uch a licence in &s;uch a country, mu&s;t have contributed to a corruption, that it may be the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of good magi&s;trates, and ages of good di&s;cipline, to re&s;tore to &s;oundne&s;s.

St. Salvador is a very &s;trong fortification; they have others that are not contemptible; be|&s;ides a good number of European regular troops, of which there are two regiments in St. Salva|dor. The militia too is regimented, among&s;t whom they reckon &s;ome bodies of Indians, and free negroes; and indeed at pre&s;ent Brazil &s;eems to be in as little danger as the &s;ettlements of any power of America, not only from their own internal &s;trength, their remotene&s;s, and the intolerable heat and unhealthine&s;s of a great part of the climate, but from the inte|re&s;t that mo&s;t of the &s;tates in Europe who are concerned in that trade, have to keep it in the hands of the Portugue&s;e.</P>
