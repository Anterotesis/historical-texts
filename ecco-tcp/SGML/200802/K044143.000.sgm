<HEAD>TO <HI>DAVID GARRICK,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMIDST the regrets I feel for your quitting the Stage, it is peculiarly gratifying, that a Play of <HI>mine</HI> clo&s;es your <HI>dramatic</HI> life&mdash;It is the highe&s;t plea&s;ure to me, that <HI>that</HI> Play, from its &s;ucce&s;s, reflects no di&s;ho|nour on your judgement as a Manager.</P>
<P>Po&s;terity will know, thro' a thou&s;and Channels, that Mr. GARRICK was the ornament of the eighteenth Century, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the friend&s;hip of tho&s;e who&s;e Names will be the glory of Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, that the fir&s;t ranks in the kingdom courted his &s;ociety&mdash;may my &s;mall voice be heard among&s;t tho&s;e who will inform it, that Mr. GARRICK's <HI>Heart</HI> was no le&s;s an honour to him, than his <HI>Talents!</HI></P>
<P>Unpatronized by any <HI>name,</HI> I pre&s;ented my&s;elf to you, ob&s;cure and unknown. You perceived <HI>dawnings</HI> in my Comedy, which you <HI>nouri&s;h'd</HI> and <HI>improved.</HI> With at|tention, and &s;ollicitude, you <HI>embelli&s;h'd,</HI> and pre&s;ented it to the world<HI>&mdash;that</HI> World, which has emulated your ge|nero&s;ity, and received it with an applau&s;e, which fills my heart with mo&s;t lively gratitude. I perceive how much of this applau&s;e I owe to my <HI>Sex.&mdash;</HI>The RUNAWAY has a thou&s;and faults, which, if written by a Man, would have incurred the &s;evere&s;t la&s;h of Critici&s;m&mdash;but the Gallantry of the Engli&s;h Nation is equal to its Wi&s;dom&mdash;they be|held
<PB REF="2">
a <HI>Woman</HI> tracing with feeble &s;teps the borders of the Parnaffian Mount&mdash;pitying her difficulties (for 'tis a thorny path) they gave their hands for her &s;upport, and placed her <HI>high</HI> above her level.</P>
<P>All this, Sir, and whatever may be its con&s;equences, I owe to you. Had you rejected me, when I pre&s;ented my little RUNAWAY, depre&s;&s;ed by the refu&s;al, and all con|fidence in <HI>my&s;elf</HI> de&s;troyed, I &s;hould never have pre|&s;umed to dip my pen again. It is now my ta&s;k to con|vince You and the World, that a generous allowance for a young Writer's faults, is the be&s;t encouragement to Ge|nius&mdash;'tis a kindly Soil, in which weak Groundlings are nouri&s;h'd, and from which the loftie&s;t Trees draw their &s;trength, and their beauty.</P>
<P>I take my leave of you, Sir, with the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for your felicity, and Mrs. GARRICK's&mdash;to who&s;e <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> and &s;ollicitede for me, I am highly indebted. May your rece&s;s from the Stage be attended with all the ble&s;&s;ings of retirement and ea&s;e&mdash;and may the world remember, in its mo&s;t di&s;tant periods, that 'tis to Mr. GARRICK the Engli&s;h Theatre owes its emancipation from gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, and buffoonery&mdash;that to Mr. GARRICK's <HI>Judgement</HI> it is indebted for being the fir&s;t Stage in Europe, and to his <HI>Talents</HI> for being the delight of the mo&s;t enlight|ened and poli&s;h'd age.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, your mo&s;t devoted, and obedient humble Servant, THE AUTHOR.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<L>To me, no pro&s;pect like your crouded hou&s;es&mdash;</L>
<L>If, as ju&s;t now, you wear tho&s;e &s;miles enchanting;</L>
<L>But, when you frown, my heart you &s;et a panting.</L>
<L>Pray then, for pity, do not frown to-night;</L>
<L>I'll bribe&mdash;but how&mdash;Oh, now I've hit it&mdash;right.</L>
<L>Secrets are plea&s;ant to each child of Eve;</L>
<L>I've one in &s;tore, which for your &s;miles I'll give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O li&s;t! a tale it is, not very common;</L>
<L>Our Poet of to-night, in faith's a&mdash;Woman,</L>
<L>A woman, too, untutor'd in the School,</L>
<L>Nor Ari&s;totle knows, nor &s;carce a rule</L>
<L>By which fine writers fabricate their plays,</L>
<L>From &s;age Menander's, to the&s;e modern days:</L>
<L>How &s;he could venture here I am a&s;toni&s;h'd;</L>
<L>But 'twas in vain the Mad-cap I admoni&s;h'd;</L>
<L>Told her of &s;queaking cat-calls, hi&s;&s;es, groans,</L>
<L>Off, offs, and ruthle&s;s Critics' damning moans.</L>
<L>I'm undi&s;may'd, &s;he cry'd, critics are Men,</L>
<L>And &s;mile on folly from a Woman's pen:</L>
<L>Then 'tis the Ladies' cau&s;e, there I'm &s;ecure;</L>
<L>Let him who hi&s;&s;es, no &s;oft Nymph endure;</L>
<L>May he who frowns, be frown'd on by his Godde&s;s,</L>
<L>From Pearls, and Bru&s;&s;els Point, to Maids in Boddice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now for a hint of her intended fea&s;t:</L>
<L>'Tis rural, playful,&mdash;harmle&s;s 'tis at lea&s;t;</L>
<L>Not over-&s;tock'd with repartee or wit,</L>
<L>Tho' here and there <HI>perchance</HI> there is a hit;</L>

For &s;he ne'er play'd with bright Apollo's fire,</L>

<L>With cheeks where innocence and health's di&s;play'd;</L>
<L>Her 'Pol&mdash;in petticoats&mdash;a romping Boy,</L>
<L>Who&s;e ta&s;te is trap-ball, and a kite his joy:</L>
<L>Her Nur&s;ery the &s;tudy, where &s;he thought,</L>
<L>Fram'd fable, incident, &s;urpri&s;e and plot.</L>
<L>From the &s;urrounding hints &s;he caught her plan,</L>
<L>Length'ning the chain from infancy to man:</L>
<L>Tom plagues poor Fan; &s;he &s;obs, but loves him &s;till;</L>
<L>Kate aims her wit at both, with rogui&s;h &s;kill:</L>
<L>Our Painter mark'd tho&s;e lines&mdash;which Nature drew,</L>
<L>Her fancy glow'd, and colour'd them&mdash;for you;</L>
<L>A Mother's pencil gave the light and &s;hades,</L>
<L>A Mother's eye thro' each &s;oft &s;cene pervades;</L>
<L>Her Children ro&s;e before her flatter'd view,</L>
<L>Hope &s;tretch'd the canvas, whil&s;t her wi&s;hes drew.</L>

<L>We'll now pre&s;ent you drapery and features,</L>
