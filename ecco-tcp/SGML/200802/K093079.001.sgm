<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN an age like the pre&s;ent, wherein literary merit of every kind &s;o much abounds, and is at the &s;ame time &s;o much encouraged; many poetical performances which de&s;erve a longer remembrance than fugitive pieces u&s;ually meet with, are daily thrown upon the public, and left to peri&s;h in oblivion. To &s;elect the&s;e from the trifling productions of the day, has ever been con&s;idered as an u&s;eful employment: and the fa|vourable reception which Mr. DODSLEY's ele|gant Collection of Poems obtained from the public, is &s;ufficient to encourage any per&s;on who has the means in his power to continue that de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed Mi&s;cellany. Several at|tempts of this &s;ort have been made, but none have acquired &s;o much reputation as to render the pre&s;ent undertaking u&s;ele&s;s or unnece&s;&s;ary.
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
Twelve years are now elap&s;ed &s;ince the la&s;t volumes of that work were publi&s;hed, in which time it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that there has been &s;o great a dearth of genius, but that many pieces have made their appearance which are not infe|rior to the be&s;t pre&s;erved in that Mi&s;cellany. Of the truth of this ob&s;ervation, the Editor ap|peals to the following Collection, which is com|piled from the be&s;t productions publi&s;hed within that time, which Mr. DODSLEY had not the opportunity of &s;eeing, with the addition of many other pieces, which with all his diligence were overlooked by him. With what degree of judgment this Collection is made, the Editor &s;ubmits to the determination of the public; the greater part of the poetical pieces of the la&s;t thirty years have pa&s;&s;ed through his hands, and as of them the following Volumes are compo&s;ed, he hopes they will not be con&s;idered as in im|proper Supplement to the work of which they are de&s;igned as a Continuation. He flatters him|&s;elf that he has not &s;uffered private friend&s;hip to obtrude any piece into this Collection, which is unworthy of the re&s;t, and great care has been
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
taken to prevent the in&s;ertion of any performance which has not been approved by gentlemen of di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation; but as he is &s;en&s;ible that the ta&s;te of per&s;ons is very different, he ex|pects not after all that every piece will meet with equal applau&s;e, being convinced of the truth of Mr. DODSLEY's ob&s;ervation, <Q REND="inline">"That it is impo&s;&s;ible to furni&s;h out an entertainment of this nature, where every part &s;hall be re|li&s;hed by every gue&s;t."</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Abelard and Eloi&s;a flouri&s;hed in the twelfth century; they were two of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons of their age in learning and beauty, but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion. After a long cour&s;e of calamities they retired each to a &s;everal convent, and con&s;ecrated the remainder of their days to religion. It was many years after this &s;eparation, that a letter of Abelard to a friend, which contained the hi&s;tory of his misfortunes, fell into the hands of Eloi&s;a: this occa&s;ioned tho&s;e celebrated letters (out of which the following is partly extract|ed) which give &s;o lively a picture of the &s;truggles of grace and nature, virtue and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<L>When her fond &s;oul impa&s;&s;ion'd, rapt, unveil'd,</L>
<L>No joy forgotten, and no wi&s;h conceal'd,</L>

He has endeavoured to de&s;cribe, in a po|etic manner, the effects of the ela&s;tic &s;team, and the great power of the atmo&s;phere; which, by their alternate actions, give force and motion to the beam of this engine, and by it, to the pump-rods, which elevate the water through tubes, and di&s;charge it out of the mine. It appears, from pretty exact calculations, that it would require about 550 men, or a power equal to that of 110 hor&s;es, to work the pumps of one of the large&s;t fire-engines now in u&s;e, (the diameter of who&s;e cylinder is &s;e|venty inches) and thrice that number of men to keep an engine of this &s;ize con&s;tantly at work. And that as much water may be rai&s;ed by an engine of this &s;ize kept con&s;tantly at work, as can be drawn up by 2520 men with rollers and buckets, after the manner now daily practi&s;ed in many mines; or as much as can be borne up on the &s;houlders of twice that number of men; as is &s;aid to be done in &s;ome of the mines of Peru.&mdash;So great is the power of the air in one of tho&s;e engines.</P>
<P>There are four fire-engines belonging to this colliery; which, when all at work, di&s;charge from it about 1228 gallons every minute, at thirteen &s;trokes; 1,768,320 gallons every twenty-four hours. By the four engines here employed, nearly twice the above-mentioned quantity of water might be di&s;charged from mines that are not above &s;ixty or &s;eventy fathoms deep, which depth is rarely exceeded in the Newca&s;tle collieries, or in any of the Engli&s;h collieries, tho&s;e of Whitehaven ex|cepted.</P>

But at Ke&s;wick, you will, on one &s;ide of the lake, &s;ee a rich and beautiful land&s;kip of cultivated fields, ri&s;ing to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, happily di&s;per&s;ed; and climbing the adjacent hills, &s;hade above &s;hade, in the mo&s;t various and picture&s;que forms. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, you will find rocks and cliffs of &s;tupendous height, hanging broken over the like in horrible grandeur, &s;ome of them a thou&s;and feet high, the woods climbing up their &s;teep and &s;haggy &s;ides, where mortal foot never yet approached: on the&s;e dreadful heights the eagles build their ne&s;ts; a variety of water-falls are &s;een pouring from their &s;ummits, and tumbling in va&s;t &s;heets from rock to rock in rude and ter|rible magnificence: while on all &s;ides of this immen&s;e amphitheatre the lofty mountains ri&s;e round, piercing the clouds in &s;hapes as &s;piry and fanta&s;tic as the very rocks of Dovedale. To this I mu&s;t add the fre|quent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: in other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt cha&s;ms or clefts, through which at hand you &s;ee rich and uncultivated vales, and beyond the&s;e, at various di&s;tance, mountain ri&s;ing over mountain; among which, new pro&s;pects pre&s;ent them&s;elves in mi&s;t, till the eye is lo&s;t in an agreeable perplexity.</P>
<Q><L>Where active fancy travels beyond &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>And pictures things un&s;een.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Were I to analy&s;e the two places into their con&s;tituent principles, I &s;hould tell you, that the full perfection of Ke&s;wick con&s;i&s;ts of three cir|cum&s;tances, beauty, horror, and immen&s;ity united; the &s;econd of which alone is found in Dovedale. Of beauty it hath little; nature having left it almo&s;t a de&s;ert: neither its &s;mall extent, nor the diminutive and life|le&s;s form of the hills, admit magnificence; but to give you a complete idea of the&s;e three perfections, as they are joined in Ke&s;wick, would re|quire the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Pou&s;&s;in. The fir&s;t &s;hould throw his delicate &s;un&s;hine over the cultivated vales, the &s;cat|tered cots, the groves, the lake, and wooded i&s;lands. The &s;econd &s;hould da&s;h out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the &s;teeps, the hanging woods, and foaming water-falls; while the grand pencil of Pou&s;&s;in &s;hould crown the whole with the maje&s;ty of the impending mountains.</P>
<P>"So much, for what I would call the permanent beauties of this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;eene. Were I not afraid of being tire&s;ome, I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties. I would &s;ail round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and i&s;land. I would point out the perpetual change of pro&s;pect: the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vani&s;hing or ri&s;ing into view: now gaining on the &s;ight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen|&s;ions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of &s;ituation, a&s;&s;uming new romantic &s;hapes, retiring and le&s;&s;ening on the eye, and in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;ing them&s;elves in an azure mi&s;t. I would remark the contra&s;t of light and &s;hade, produced by the morning and evening &s;un; the one gilding the we&s;tern, the other the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this immen&s;e amphi|theatre; while the va&s;t &s;hadow projected by the mountains buries the oppo&s;ite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly pe|netrate: the natural variety of colouring which the &s;everal objects pro|duce is no le&s;s wonderful and plea&s;ing: the ruling tincts in the valley being tho&s;e of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, ari&s;ing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the gra&s;s, and corn-fields: the&s;e are finely contra&s;ted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heigh|tened by the yellow &s;treams of light, the purple hues, and mi&s;ty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a &s;erene air and clear &s;ky di&s;clo&s;e the tops of the highe&s;t hills: at others, you &s;ee the clouds involving their &s;um|mits, re&s;ting on their &s;ides, or de&s;cending to their ba&s;e, and rolling among the vallies, as in a va&s;t furnace; when the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are &s;een in va&s;t bodies &s;weeping along the hills in gloomy great|ne&s;s, while the lake joins the tumult, and to&s;&s;es like a &s;ea: but in calm weather the whole &s;cene becomes new: the lake is a perfect mirror; and the land&s;kip in all its beauty: i&s;lands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are &s;een inverted, and floating on its &s;urface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, if you dare approach the ridge, a new &s;cene of a&s;toni&s;hment pre&s;ents it&s;elf; where the valley, lake, and i&s;lands, &s;eem lying at your feet; where this expan&s;e of water ap|pears dimini&s;hed to a little pool amid&s;t the va&s;t and immea&s;urable ob|jects that &s;urround it; for here the &s;ummits of more di&s;tant hills appear beyond tho&s;e you have already &s;een; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ing behind each other in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken &s;teeps, form an immen&s;e and awful picture, which can only be expre&s;&s;ed by the image of a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of mountains. Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circum&s;tance more; which is, that a walk by &s;till moon-light (at which time the di&s;tant water-falls are heard in all their variety of &s;ound) among the&s;e inchant|ing dales, open &s;uch &s;cenes of delicate beauty, repo&s;e, and &s;olemnity, as exceed all de&s;cription.</P></Q></P></NOTE> Ke&s;wick's vale, the mu&s;e will guide.</L>
