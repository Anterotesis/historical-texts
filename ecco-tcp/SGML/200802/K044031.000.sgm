<HEAD>REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Addre&s;s the following Remarks to you, not be|cau&s;e I pretend to gue&s;s at your Per&s;on, but becau&s;e I think you are mo&s;t intere&s;ted in them; and I &s;end you them plain and &s;imple, without prefacing them either with Compliments or Acri|mony.</P>
<P>I entirely agree with you in your fir&s;t general Ob&s;ervation, (P. 2.) that of mo&s;t, if not <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all Arts or Exertions of human Faculty, tho&s;e which Dr. Brown has cho&s;en for his Subject are mo&s;t liable to be influenced by a Variety of Cau&s;es; &s;eem|ingly mo&s;t remote and minute, and mo&s;t difficult to be ob&s;erved".</Q> But &s;urely your Conclu&s;ion is not logical; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That to think, by laying down one or a few Principles, to deduce the Progre&s;s of them &s;y&s;tematically, is parallel to <HI>Almanack|makers</HI> foretelling the Weather."</Q> In my Opi|nion the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion is not whether they can be &s;olved &s;y&s;tematically or not, but whether Dr. B&mdash;'s Solution is ju&s;t or groundle&s;s: And if
<PB N="2" REF="3">
you apply this Conclu&s;ion to his Work, before you have examined it, your Determination mu&s;t be ranked with the Judgments of tho&s;e Coun|tries, where they <HI>behead</HI> a Man fir&s;t and try after|wards whether he is Guilty.</P>
<P>Your &s;econd Ob&s;ervation is of the <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Unimpor|tance of &s;uch Inve&s;tigations, as being mere amu&s;|ing Gratifications of Curio&s;ity."</Q>Yet if you are really in earne&s;t, how came you (who have affected to di&s;play &s;o large a Fund of Reading) to have  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P. 2.</NOTE> employed &s;o much of your Thoughts on a <HI>&s;mall Part</HI> of this very Subject? And <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> if ever you publi&s;h your Thoughts,"</Q>I ap|peal to your own Heart, in what E&s;timation you would hold the Man who &s;hould tell you they were of  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no Importance to Mankind, or rank <HI>them,</HI> as you have done Dr. B&mdash;'s, with <HI>Alma|nack-making.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Your third Objection <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of the doctorial Man|ner and Air of Science with which it has been fa&s;hionable of late to advance Conjectures;"</Q> is at lea&s;t not liberal. If Dr. B&mdash;'s Conjectures are fal&s;e, it <HI>ought</HI> to be Triumph enough for you to prove them &s;o; if on the contrary, notwith|&s;tanding your Arguments, they prove <HI>true, ought</HI> they not to be advanced with the Confidence of Truth, by a Man who knows them <HI>&s;o."</HI></P>
<P>I entirely acquie&s;ce in your fourth Ob&s;erva|tion <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that, &s;ince Truth is the principal Purpo&s;e the&s;e Inve&s;tigations can an&s;wer, <HI>Mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
or even <HI>Error</HI> in matter of Fact is le&s;s excu&s;able in them than in any other Kind of Enquiry,"</Q> ex|cept in &s;uch as <HI>your's</HI> and <HI>mine,</HI> where if we <HI>mi&s;|repre&s;ent</HI> either thro' <HI>Prejudice</HI> or <HI>Partiality,</HI> or <HI>err</HI> in Matters of Fact when we would correct the <HI>Errors</HI> of others, then we are <HI>le&s;s excu&s;able,</HI> be|cau&s;e we are <HI>le&s;s hone&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>So much may &s;uffice for your Preliminaries; The Body of your Work remains now to be exa|mined.</P>
<P N="1">1. You &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will not take the Advantage of the obvious Ridicule which ari&s;es from the &s;earching the Seeds and Principles of all the mo&s;t refined and tran&s;porting Poetry of Greece, in the dreary Wilds of North-America <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;'Tis indeed out of the common road, for Dr. B. to carry us &s;o <HI>far</HI> in Que&s;t of <HI>Brutality,</HI> when he might have found it &s;o much nearer Home, among the old <HI>Pela&s;gi</HI> of ancient <HI>Greece;</HI> who certainly were no better than the modern <HI>Iroquois.</HI> We know they were <HI>Acorn-Eaters</HI> and <HI>Man-Eaters:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sylve&s;tres Homines,</HI> Sacer Interpre&s;que Deorum, <HI>Caedibus</HI> &amp; <HI>Victu foedo</HI> deterruit ORPHEUS <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Horace.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t we know of them; and this we know of the modern <HI>Iroquois</HI> too, but then we know <HI>a great dealmore.</HI> Now, what we know of the <HI>mordern Iroquois,</HI> Dr. B. on the Foundation of <HI>Analogy,</HI> applies to the <HI>old Pela&s;gi:</HI> He attempts
<PB N="4" REF="5">
to prove by an ea&s;y Chain of Rea&s;oning, that in Ca&s;e of a &s;uppo&s;ed Civilization of <HI>Iroquois,</HI> &s;uch Con&s;equences might naturally be expected to ari&s;e, as did actually ari&s;e in <HI>antient Greece;</HI> and <HI>vicever&s;a,</HI> that as the <HI>old Pela&s;gi</HI> were once in the &s;ame State as the <HI>Iroquois</HI> are now, they actually did proceed by the &s;ame Steps as the&s;e would probably do upon a &s;imilar Civilization. The Argument is new I confe&s;s, but is not therefore to be treated with Contempt. If the Principles on which all Savage Tribes proceed are <HI>always</HI> &s;imple, and nearly the &s;ame in all, making only &s;ome &s;mall Allowance for the Difference of Soil, and Cli|mate: If the Similarity of Cau&s;es and Effects be too clear and convincing to be denied; in a Word if, even where Variations of Character ari&s;e, they &s;erve rather to illu&s;trate than confound the Sub|ject, certainly any Conclu&s;ions properly drawn from &s;o amazing an Analogy, mu&s;t fall little &s;hort of Demon&s;tration.&mdash;The Method then of Argu|mentation no rational Man can object to; let us therefore &s;ee whether Dr. B&mdash;has &s;u&s;tained it properly in tho&s;e Parts which regard ancient Greece.</P>
<P>You begin with a very material Point, which if once made out would overthrow Dr. B&mdash;'s Hypothe&s;is from the Foundation. You tell us, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is taken for granted all along, that the Poetry and Mu&s;ic, and Legi&s;lation, and Religion of Greece, were entirely the &s;pontaneous Productions of that Climate"</Q> but that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is certain, the fir&s;t Seeds
<PB N="5" REF="6">
of them were imported <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>."</Q>You then appeal to ancient Authors, and affirm (from them) that Dr. B's Sy&s;tem  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cannot hold, &s;ince their <HI>fir&s;t Civilizers</HI> did certainly introduce <HI>foreign Gods,</HI> and <HI>were not the Object of Wor&s;hip them&s;elves</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 5.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To prove that it was otherwi&s;e, you cite <HI>Hero|dotus;</HI> and you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he a&s;&s;ures us that the Pe|la&s;gi had no more than &s;ome general Notion of <HI>a &s;uperior Power</HI> who <HI>made</HI> the World <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>."</Q> Now, how can <HI>You,</HI> who&s;e Work profe&s;&s;es to be built on the Pillar of <HI>&s;trict Quotation,</HI> how can <HI>You</HI> begin with &s;o egregious an Untruth? In your Tran&s;lation you have repre&s;ented the PE|LASGI <HI>(Acorn-Eaters</HI> and <HI>Man-Eaters)</HI> as <HI>pure Thei&s;ts;</HI> and it &s;eems it was <HI>Orpheus</HI> who <HI>after|wards</HI> deba&s;ed them into gro&s;s <HI>Idolaters</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Euterpe, l. 52.</NOTE>. Now <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;ays nothing of all this. He men|tions not <HI>a &s;uperior Power;</HI> but expre&s;sly &s;ays <HI>Gods</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) nor does he &s;peak one Word of their <HI>making,</HI> but only of their <HI>governing</HI> the World <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>. And is not this a palmary Argument in Proof of their having no Religion, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they <HI>wor&s;hiped</HI> the <HI>Gods,</HI> who in their Opinion <HI>governed the World?"</HI></Q>&mdash;Well: but it &s;eems, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they knew no Name for any Divinity; the Names of their Gods were brought from Egypt; and if their Gods had been their own Chiefs, <HI>their</HI> Names would have been better remembered than
<PB N="6" REF="7">
any Thing el&s;e <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>."</Q> Here, I confe&s;s with Plea&s;ure, is &s;ome Appearance of good Rea&s;on|ing.</P>
<P>But to &s;et this Matter in its true Light; and acquaint you whence it probably came to pa&s;s, that the <HI>&s;avage Pela&s;gi</HI> had no Names for their Gods, I mu&s;t (in Imitation of Dr. B.) carry you once more among your new Acquaintances, the Savages of America.&mdash;You mu&s;t know, then, that the &s;avage Tribes &s;eldom retain the <HI>particular Name</HI> of the <HI>Chieftain</HI> whom they <HI>deify</HI> and <HI>wor|&s;hip:</HI> and the Rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e he ge|nerally <HI>lo&s;es</HI> it even <HI>before be dies.</HI> When he is exalted to the Rank of <HI>Chief,</HI> his former Name is commonly dropped, and a new Appellation is giv|en him, &s;uited to the Station he is rai&s;ed to: This Title (rather than Name) is generally that of <HI>Father, Senior,</HI> or <HI>Sun</HI> of the Tribe. In Proof of this I might refer you to all the Writers on the Manners of &s;avage Tribes: On this Subject, how|ever, LAFITAU and the <HI>Lettres Edifiantes,</HI> will give you ample Satisfaction. Under this State of Things, the &s;avage Tribes offer Sacrifice, con&s;ult Oracles, and perform the general Acts of a na|tive Religion. This, then, &s;eems to have been the idolatrous State of the old Pela&s;gi: They probably wor&s;hipped their fir&s;t &s;avage Chief|tains; for it is clear, on the Evidence of <HI>Hero|dotus</HI> him&s;elf, that they offered <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to their Gods, and <HI>con&s;ulted</HI> the <HI>Oracle</HI> of <HI>Dodona,</HI> whe|ther
<PB N="7" REF="8">
they &s;hould give the <HI>Egyptian Names</HI> to <HI>their own Deities</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Herod. ib.</NOTE>: two Circum&s;tances which prove even to Demon&s;tration, that they had Deities be|fore the Time of Orpheus.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what then did Orpheus intro|duce, if he introduced not the Gods of Greece?"</Q> Why, Herodotus tells us, as plain as Words can tell us: He introduced <HI>My&s;teries</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">): and that he might di&s;tingui&s;h the native Gods whom he found already e&s;tabli&s;hed by a general Wor|&s;hip, he appropriated particular Rites to each; and to this End, very properly di&s;tingui&s;hed each God by a particular Appellation, But &s;ure, ne|ver was Critic &s;o unlucky in his Remarks as You: For it has been made appear by a learned Wri|ter, that the&s;e <GAP DESC="foreign">, the&s;e very <HI>My&s;teries</HI> which ORPHEUS introduced to Greece, were &s;o far from being the <HI>Beginnings</HI> of <HI>Heroe Wor&s;hip,</HI> that they were intended as a <HI>Detection</HI> (to the <HI>initiated)</HI> of the <HI>Errors</HI> of <HI>pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed Polythei&s;m</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Div. Leg. of Mo&s;es, B. ii. Sect. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the <HI>olde&s;t Gods</HI> of Greece were &s;trictly <HI>native:</HI> I &s;hall now prove that they were the <HI>Chiefs</HI> and <HI>fir&s;t Civilizers</HI> of the &s;avage Inhabitants. That they were &s;uch, is evident from the Te&s;timony of &s;everal ancient Authors, found|ed on the Traditions of the Country, which are the only original Evidences that can be obtained in a Ca&s;e of this Nature.&mdash;The fir&s;t and chief of the&s;e was He, to whom <HI>Orpheus</HI> (it &s;eems) gave
<PB N="8" REF="9">
the Name of JUPITER. This old Chieftain was born in Crete: and was brought young by his Mother into Greece <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. x.</NOTE>. He conquered the <HI>Ti|tans</HI> (probably another Tribe of Savages, at En|mity with the <HI>Pela&s;gi)</HI> and civilized the Inhabi|tants of the Country which he &s;ubdued <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Diodorus, l. iii.</NOTE>. Af|ter he had vanqui&s;hed the <HI>Titans,</HI> he is &s;aid by &s;ome Authors to have in&s;tituted the Olympian Games, in Commemoration of his Victory <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;anias, l. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e mo&s;t ancient Gods of Greece, to whom ORPHEUS gave the Name of APOLLO, was a Chief who killed the Serpent <HI>Python,</HI> and the Tyrant <HI>Titius;</HI> taught the Inhabitants of Greece the U&s;e of the Fruits of the Earth, and civilized the Inhabitants of &s;everal Di&s;tricts <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Strabo, l. ix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two more of the&s;e ancient Gods of Greece, were the famed Brothers, CASTOR and POLLUX. They were Natives of the little I&s;le of <HI>Pephnos</HI> near <HI>Me&s;&s;ene</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;anias, l.</NOTE>; and taught the Lacedemonians the Arts of Dancing and of War <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Lucian. de Saltati|one.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e <HI>four</HI> are the very <HI>ancient Gods</HI> whom Dr. B. has &s;ingled out, as being delivered down to Po&s;terity under the Characters of Mu&s;i|cians, Singers, and Dancers. All of them Chiefs and Civilizers of ancient Greece, in &s;ome Depart|ment or other of Legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>But he might have added &s;everal more. Of this Cla&s;s was MERCURY. He was born in
<PB N="9" REF="10">
Greece <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Pau&s;anias Arcad.</NOTE>; was the <HI>Inventor</HI> of the <HI>Lyre;</HI> and is &s;aid to have been deified for this Invention <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Eliac.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another Deification I mu&s;t not pa&s;s over: You have led me to it your&s;elf: It is that of BAC|CHUS; who&s;e Love of Wine, Dance, and Mu&s;ic, is too well known to need a Comment. You &s;peak of his My&s;teries, as being not of Grecian but foreign Original; and thence you conclude, that the God him&s;elf was &s;o. I need hardly bid you turn back to the preceding Pages, to put you in Mind how inconclu&s;ive this Argument is. The <HI>old Chieftain</HI> him&s;elf was a Civilizer of <HI>Greece,</HI> tho' his <HI>My&s;teries</HI> (introduced by ORPHEUS) were <HI>Egyptian.</HI> You will demand a Proof of the God being a Civilizer of Greece. Take the following Account, then; which unfortunately contains as ample a Confutation of all you have advanced on this Subject, as any Heart can wi&s;h. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"PHILO|NIDES informs us, that the Vine having been tran&s;plated from the Borders of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> into <HI>Greece,</HI> by BACCHUS;&mdash;the Greeks, when the unmixed Wine is brought to Table at Sup|per, invoke the good Genius or God, honouring (or wor&s;hipping) the Power who invented it: This God is BACCHUS <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Athen. Deip. l. xv.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>Thus, your capital Objection to Dr. B's Sy&s;|tem &s;eems ab&s;olutely untenable, and void of all Foundation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="11">
3. You proceed, next, to object again&s;t his Account of the Origin of <HI>poetic Numbers</HI> <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 8, 9, 13, &amp;c.</NOTE> What you have advanced on this Subject, I &s;hall only &s;tile an In&s;tance of your <HI>Power of Repre|&s;entation.&mdash;</HI>You confound the Origin of <HI>Poetry</HI> with the Origin of <HI>mere Rythm;</HI> nor perhaps is it nece&s;&s;ary that a mere Critic &s;hould know the Difference.&mdash;You repre&s;ent Savages, in their lowe&s;t State of Nature, to have no Lei&s;ure for Amu&s;ement; when, if you will <HI>read,</HI> you will <HI>find,</HI> they have <HI>more</HI> Lei&s;ure than any <HI>civilized</HI> Nations:&mdash;You charge Dr. B. with repre&s;enting them as going formally to Work, with an <HI>a-priori Notion</HI> of Harmony and Mea&s;ure, to adapt their Words to Mu&s;ic; when in Reality he tells you from <HI>Lafitau,</HI> that they dance and &s;ing, and join their Words to their Mu&s;ic as well as they can; and to this End, that they <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"even retrench and &s;trike off &s;ome Syllables from their Words,"</Q>that they  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"may tally better with their Dance and Mu&s;ic; and hence the natural Origin of Rythm or Numbers"</Q>&mdash;You own that the Dance <HI>cannot be totally without Mea&s;ure;</HI> and yet you deny its Tendency to produce a <HI>corre&s;pondent Mea&s;ure</HI> in the <HI>annexed Words:&mdash;</HI>You &s;ay that violent Emotions of the Mind naturally produce harmonious Periods, yet though you are very angry through your whole Work, you never produce one harmonious Period.&mdash;Such
<PB N="11" REF="12">
are the Materials of this Article, which I &s;hall leave to the Reader's Contemplations.</P>
<P N="4">4. But you have not yet done with the old Dei|ties of Greece: You &s;ay you remember a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pa&s;|&s;age of ARISTOTLE full in the Teeth of Dr. B's Sy&s;tem: wherein it is ob&s;erved, that "the Poets never repre&s;ent Jupiter &s;inging <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>."</Q>Truly, neither does Dr. B. for he only &s;ays (on the Authority of a very old Poet) that  <Q REND="inline margQuotes"> <HI>"Jupiter</HI> danced."</Q> 'Tis a little hard upon the Father of Gods and Men, thus to tie him Hand and Foot becau&s;e he wanted an <HI>Ear,</HI> or happened to be <HI>hoar&s;e:</HI> and becau&s;e he did not <HI>&s;ing,</HI> that you won't let him <HI>dance</HI> neither. Good Sir, be a lit|tle more ingenuous in your Application of ancient Authors.</P>
<P>But you affirm, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Arctinus mentions Ju|piter's Dancing as a Thing <HI>unu&s;ual</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">lb.</NOTE>."</Q> Now, why did not you refer to the Pa&s;&s;age in Athenaeus which you here allude to? Was it for Fear the Reader might con&s;ult it?&mdash;With &s;ome Trouble I have found it; and am &s;orry to &s;ay, I have detected you in what an illiberal Critic would call a downright Fal&s;ehood. The following is a literal Tran&s;lation of the Pa&s;&s;age. <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>"Eumelus</HI> or <HI>Arctinus</HI> the Corinthian &s;omewhere intro|duces Jupiter dancing; &s;aying, "Among them danced the Sire of Gods and Men <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Deip. l. i.</NOTE>."</Q>  Not a Syllable occurs here, on its being either an <HI>u&s;ual</HI> or <HI>unu&s;ual Thing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">But it &s;eems, 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Character of the Poet &s;hould be a&s;certained whether &s;erious or bur|le&s;que, &amp;c. before any thing concerning the whole Sy&s;tem of Grecian Religion be deter|mined by one Quotation at Second-hand from him <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>."</Q>&mdash;You are a notable Logician.&mdash;But it happens, that the Proof of Dr. B's Sy&s;|tem does not depend upon this one Quotation: he has (in the Cour&s;e of his Di&s;&s;ertation) given twenty more, which are generally corroborative of This.</P>
<P N="5">5. You next come to con&s;ider Dr. B's Account of the Origin of Poetic Hi&s;tory: You charge Dr. B. with mi&s;quoting and mi&s;repre&s;enting the Author of the Life of Homer, in order to bring him to his own Purpo&s;e <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 15.</NOTE>. But in reality, all that Dr. B. has done, is to expre&s;s that <HI>properly,</HI> which the Author of the Life of Homer had ex|pre&s;&s;ed <HI>improperly:</HI> Both their Expre&s;&s;ions imply the &s;ame Thing. You farther charge Dr. B. in|deed, with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"turning <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Works into <HI>Arabic</HI> ones <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>."</Q> Now the&s;e Spani&s;h Fragments are indeed Arabic by De&s;cent; and this is evidently Dr. B's Meaning. But You, I find, being igno|rant of their Original, did not comprehend his Meaning.</P>
<P N="6">6. On the Subject of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ancient Laws being written in Ver&s;e,"</Q>you &s;ay,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Actions of their Gods and Heroes were &s;uch as could not
<PB N="13" REF="14">
be a Foundation for moral Exhortations to Imi|tation <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 16.</NOTE>."</Q> Here, I &s;u&s;pect, that in&s;tead of putting <HI>your&s;elf</HI> in the Place of the <HI>Savages,</HI> you have put the <HI>Savages</HI> in <HI>your Place.</HI> Certainly, to a <HI>modern Engli&s;hman,</HI> the Actions of their Gods and Heroes could never have &s;eemed a worthy Model for Imitation: Yet to an ancient &s;avage Greek (an Acorn-Eater, and a Man-Eater) they might very well pa&s;s for &s;uch. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Plunder and Revenge (as you ob&s;erve <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 13.</NOTE>) being what the Savage chiefly values,"</Q> an Exhortation to this Purpo&s;e would naturally be included in the Song-Fea&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P N="7">7. You &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I would fain know why the Doctor &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the Practice of <HI>religious Dance</HI> and <HI>Song</HI> to have <HI>nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;en</HI> from a <HI>fal&s;e Religion,</HI> which, as he him&s;elf takes No|tice, made a Part of the <HI>true</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P. 17.</NOTE>."</Q> But where has the Doctor a&s;&s;erted, that they <HI>nece&s;&s;a|rily aro&s;e?</HI> That they <HI>naturally</HI> aro&s;e both among <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> he has made it very evident. Now, why &s;hould we have Recour&s;e to a pedantic Principle of <HI>Imitation,</HI> void of Evi|dence, for a Practice which manife&s;tly ari&s;es from <HI>Nature?</HI> I expect, you will prove in your next Work, that all <HI>Pagans</HI> learnt of the <HI>Jews,</HI> how to beget Children, and eat their Victuals.</P>
<P N="8">8. You now come to the old poetic Oracles of GREECE: So far as the Affair of mere Rea&s;oning
<PB N="14" REF="15">
is concerned, I &s;hall again leave you to the natu|ral Penetration of the Reader.
