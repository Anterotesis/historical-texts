<P>THE following little Piece is an imitation of the French comic operas of one act, which are generally characterized, either by their natural &s;implicity, or &s;ome &s;ingle &s;triking incident, and little or nothing more is de&s;igned.&mdash;It is now fir&s;t attempted to introduce this &s;pecies of entertain|ment on the Engli&s;h theatre, as containing excel|lent &s;ituations for light airs.&mdash;On the French &s;tage, notwith&s;tanding all their merit, they tire in the length of time taken for repre&s;entation; and, were they &s;pun out to the common length of our after-pieces, it is conceived they would be found &s;till more in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject matter therefore being wholly pre&s;erved, and the dialogue both varied and compre&s;&s;ed, they are, with every deference, &s;ub|mitted to public judgment.</P>
