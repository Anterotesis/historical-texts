<P>IT has long been, and &s;till remains a &s;ettled Rule with AUTHORS, to chu&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;picuous Characters for Patrons; thus far I comply with general Cu&s;tom, which, however ridiculous, it is dan|gerous to break through; as to the trite Panegyrics of Dedication, they &s;eem ab&s;olutely unnece&s;&s;ary upon the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, for your Virtues,&mdash;Qualifications I mean, are &s;o very generally known, that they require not any Illu&s;tration, being &s;ufficient Blazon to them&s;elves; therefore it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that to your great Predece&s;&s;ors, the DRAMA is obliged for many of its mo&s;t &s;tri|king Characters. To you, and your courtly Tribe of Imitators, we &s;tand indebted for the frequent, curious Amendments of FASHION, and Machinations of LOVE; al&s;o for OPERAS, BURLETTAS, MAS|QUERADES, PANTOMIMES, DRUMS, ROUTS, with a long &amp;c. of <HI>Time-killing</HI> Amu&s;ements; and la&s;t, <HI>though not lea&s;t in Love,</HI> for the following Tale founded on your Sy&s;tems of Life, which Circum|&s;tance mu&s;t particularly recommend it to your mo&s;t indulgent Pa|tronage.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">
'TIS true I may appear in this Addre&s;s as an INDIAN wor&s;hipping the Devil, however that may be, it will evidently follow from One Con&s;ideration, that I have an undoubted Right to claim your Pa|tronage, when I declare that many Actions of my own Life have been truly <HI>Coxcomical,</HI> and perhaps not One of them more &s;o than my Compliance with the <HI>Cacoethes Scribendi,</HI> which urged me to commence AUTHOR&punc; e&s;pecially a Poetical or Ver&s;ifying One.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I had almo&s;t dated this Addre&s;s, <HI>April</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> but being &s;en&s;ible that it was giving the CRITICS a fair Opportunity to honour me with the <HI>Title</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> I &s;tep Four and Twenty Hours forward in the Year 1754.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ADVERTISEMENT</HI> TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>KNOWING from per&s;onal Experience how apt prefatory Matter is to pall, I &s;hall no farther intrude upon the Lei&s;ure of my Readers than briefly to ob&s;erve, that the following Narration is founded on Truth; that it is related, exclu&s;ive of an Alteration in the Cata&s;trophe of <HI>NARCISSA,</HI> with &s;trict Fidelity. What Merit there may be in it, I &s;hall leave the Public to decide; I am well apprized that the Characters will &s;eem &s;omewhat imperfect, particularly <HI>ELIZA,</HI> who does not appear &s;ufficiently to con&s;titute a Principal; but I hope to be excu&s;ed any Error of this Kind, though voluntary, as I found Prolixity &s;tealing in upon me, which I was re&s;olved at any Rate to avoid.</P>
<P>I &s;hould perhaps have thrown the Incidents together in Pro&s;e, but that I think the Town already too much harra&s;&s;ed with <HI>MEMOIRS, ADVEN|TURES,</HI> &amp;c. This is a Sort of Deviation, and I hope &s;ome Per&s;ons of &s;tronger Genius than I imagine my&s;elf to be will communicate Pictures of Life in poetical Narratives.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, as I know many Faults mu&s;t appear, I earne&s;tly reque&s;t that every judicious Reader will make &s;uch Amendments as &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, and render it, if po&s;&s;ible, agreeable to his or her Ta&s;te, believing I &s;hould have done the &s;ame, had it been in my Power.</P>
