<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY in&s;cribing this &s;light performance to you, I do not mean &s;o much to compliment you as my&s;elf. It may do me &s;ome honour to inform the public, that I have lived many years in in|timacy with you. It may &s;erve the intere&s;ts of mankind al&s;o to inform them, that the greate&s;t wit may be found in a character, without im|pairing the mo&s;t unaffected piety.</P>
<P>I have, particularly, rea&s;on to thank you for your partiality to this performance. The un|dertaking a comedy, not merely &s;entimental, was very dangerous; and Mr. Colman, who &s;aw this piece in its various &s;tages, always thought it &s;o. However I ventured to tru&s;t it to the public; and though it was nece&s;&s;arily de|layed till late in the &s;ea&s;on, I have every rea&s;on to be grateful.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Dear Sir, Your mo&s;t &s;incere friend, And admirer, OLIVER GOLDSMITH.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<LG>
<L><HI>EXCUSE</HI> me, Sirs, I pray&mdash;I can't yet &s;peak&mdash;</L>
<L>I'm crying now&mdash;and have been all the week!</L>
<L><HI>'Tis not alone this mourning &s;uit,</HI> good ma&s;ters;</L>
<L><HI>I've that within&mdash;</HI>for which there are no plai&s;ters!</L>
<L>Pray wou'd you know the rea&s;on why I'm crying?</L>
<L>The Comic mu&s;e, long &s;ick, is now a dying!</L>
<L>And if &s;he goes, my tears will never &s;top;</L>
<L>For as a play'r, I can't &s;queeze out one drop:</L>
<L>I am undone, that's all&mdash;&s;hall lo&s;e my bread&mdash;</L>
<L>I'd rather, but that's nothing&mdash;lo&s;e my head.</L>
<L>When the &s;weet maid is laid upon the bier,</L>
<L><HI>Shuter</HI> and <HI>I</HI> &s;hall be chief mourners here.</L>
<L>To her a mawki&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;purious breed,</L>
<L>Who deals in &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">tals will &s;ucceed!</L>

<L>Both nervous grown, to keep our &s;pirits up,</L>
<L>We now and then take down a hearty cup.</L>
<L>What &s;hall we do?&mdash;If Comedy for&s;ake us!</L>
<L>They'll turn us out, and no one el&s;e will take us,</L>
<L>But why can't I be moral?&mdash;Let me try&mdash;</L>
<L>My heart thus pre&s;&s;ing&mdash;fix'd my face and eye&mdash;</L>
<L>With a &s;ententious look, that nothing means,</L>

<L>Thus I begin<HI>&mdash;All is not gold that glitters,</HI></L>
<L>Plea&s;ure &s;eems &s;weet, but proves a gla&s;s of bitters.</L>
<L>When ign'rance enters, folly is at hand;</L>
<L>Learning is better far than hou&s;e and land:</L>
<L>Let not your virtue trip, who trips may &s;tumble,</L>

<L>I give it up&mdash;morals won't do for me;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Vow, Mr. Hardca&s;tle, you're very particular. Is there a creature in the whole country, but our|&s;elves, that does not take a trip to town now and then, to rub off the ru&s;t a little? There's the two Mi&s;s Hoggs, and our neighbour, Mrs. Grig&s;by, go to take a month's poli&s;hing every winter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and bring back vanity and affectation to la&s;t them the whole year. I wonder why London cannot keep its own fools at home. In my time, the follies of the town crept &s;lowly among us, but now they travel fa&s;ter than a &s;tage-coach. Its fopperies come down, not only as in&s;ide pa&s;&s;engers, but in the very ba&s;ket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>your</HI> times were fine times, indeed; you have been telling us of <HI>them</HI> for many a long year. Here we live in an old rumbling man&s;ion, that looks for all the world like an inn, but that we never &s;ee compa|ny. Our be&s;t vi&s;itors are old Mrs. Oddfi&s;h, the cu|rate's wife, and little Cripplegate, the lame danc|ing-ma&s;ter: And all our entertainment your old &s;tories of Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough. I hate &s;uch old-fa&s;hioned trumpery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I love it. I love every thing that's old: old friends, old times, old manners, old books, old wine; and, I believe, Dorothy, <STAGE>(taking her hand)</STAGE> you'll own I have been pretty fond of an old wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Mr. Hardca&s;tle, you're for ever at your Dorothy's and your old wife's. You may be a Dar|by, but I'll be no Joan, I promi&s;e you. I'm not &s;o old as you'd make me, by more than one good year. Add twenty to twenty, and make money of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me &s;ee; twenty added to twenty, makes ju&s;t fifty and &s;even.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's fal&s;e, Mr. Hardca&s;tle: I was but twenty when I was brought to bed of Tony, that I had by Mr. Lumpkin, my fir&s;t hu&s;band; and he's not come to years of di&s;cretion yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever will, I dare an&s;wer for him. Ay, you have taught <HI>him</HI> finely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, Tony Lumpkin has a good fortune. My &s;on is not to live by his learning. I don't think a boy wants much learning to &s;pend fifteen hundred a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Learning, quotha! A mere compo&s;ition of tricks and mi&s;chief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humour, my dear: nothing but humour. Come, Mr. Hardca&s;tle, you mu&s;t allow the boy a little humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'd &s;ooner allow him an hor&s;e-pond. If burning the footmens &s;hoes, frighting the maids, and worry|ing the kittens, be humour, he has it. It was but ye&s;terday he fa&s;tened my wig to the back of my chair, and when I went to make a bow, I popt my bald head in Mrs. Frizzle's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And am I to blame? The poor boy was always too &s;ickly to do any good. A &s;chool would be his death. When he comes to be a little &s;tronger, who knows what a year or two's Latin may do for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Latin for him! A cat and fiddle. No, no, the ale-hou&s;e and the &s;table are the only &s;chools he'll ever go to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we mu&s;t not &s;nub the poor boy now, for I believe we &s;han't have him long among us. Any body that looks in his face may &s;ee he's con&s;umptive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, if growing too fat be one of the &s;ymptoms.</P>

<P>Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.</P>

<P>Depend upon it, child, I'll never controul your choice; but Mr. Marlow, whom I have pitched upon, is the &s;on of my old friend, Sir Charles Mar|low, of whom you have heard me talk &s;o often.

<P>As I live, the mo&s;t intimate friend of Mr. Ha&s;tings, <HI>my</HI> admirer. They are never a&s;under. I believe you mu&s;t have &s;een him when we lived in town.</P>

<P>He's a very &s;ingular character, I a&s;&s;ure you. Among women of reputation and virtue, he is the mode&s;te&s;t man alive; but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another &s;tamp: you under&s;tand me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>An odd character, indeed. I &s;hall never be able

to manage him. What &s;hall I do? P&s;haw, think no more of him, but tru&s;t to occurrences for &s;uc|ce&s;s. But how goes on your own affair my dear, has my mother been courting you for my brother Tony, as u&s;ual?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ju&s;t come from one of our agreeable t&ecirc;te a-t&ecirc;tes. She has been &s;aying a hundred tender things, and &s;etting off her pretty mon&s;ter as the very pink of perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s HARDCASTLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And her partiality is &s;uch, that &s;he actually thinks him &s;o. A fortune like your's is no &s;mall tempta|tion. Be&s;ides, as &s;he has the &s;ole management of it, I'm not &s;urprized to &s;ee her unwilling to let it go out of the family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s NEVILLE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fortune like mine, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in jewels, is no &s;uch mighty temptation. But at any rate if my dear Ha&s;tings be but con&s;tant, I make no doubt to be too hard for her at la&s;t. However, I let her &s;uppo&s;e that I am in love with her &s;on, and &s;he never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is a good natured creature at bottom, and I'm &s;ure would wi&s;h to &s;ee me married to any body but him&s;elf. But my aunt's bell rings for our after|noon's walk round the improvements. Allons. Cou|rage is nece&s;&s;ary as our affairs are critical.</P>

<P>As you &s;ay, we pa&s;&s;engers are to be taxed to pay all the&s;e fineries. I have often &s;een a good &s;ideboard, or a marble chimney-piece, tho' not actually put in the bill, enflame a reckoning confoundedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Travellers, George, mu&s;t pay in all places. The only difference is, that in good inns, you pay dearly for luxuries; in bad inns, you are fleeced and &s;tarved.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HASTINGS.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have lived pretty much among them. In truth, I have been often &s;urprized, that you who have &s;een &s;o much of the world, with your natural good &s;en&s;e, and your many opportunities, could never yet acquire a requi&s;ite &s;hare of a&s;&s;urance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Engli&s;hman's malady. But tell me, George, where could I have learned that a&s;&s;urance you talk of? My life has been chiefly &s;pent in a college, or an inn, in &s;eclu&s;ion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence. I don't know that I was ever familiarly acquainted with a &s;ingle mode&s;t woman&mdash;except my mother&mdash;But among fe|males of another cla&s;s you know&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why man that's becau&s;e I <HI>do</HI> want to &s;teal out of the room. Faith, I have often formed
<PB N="21" REF="27">
a re&s;olution to break the ice, and rattle away at any rate. But I don't know how, a &s;ingle glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally over&s;et my re&s;o|lution. An impudent fellow may counterfeit mo|de&s;ty, but I'll be hanged if a mode&s;t man can ever counterfeit impudence.</P>

<P>Why, George, I can't &s;ay fine things to them, They freeze, they petrify me. They may talk of a comet, or a burning mountain, or &s;ome &s;uch baga|telle. But to me, a mode&s;t woman, dre&s;t out in all her finery, is the mo&s;t tremendous object of the whole creation.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARLOW.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, unle&s;s as among kings and princes, my bride were to be courted by proxy. If, indeed, like an Ea&s;tern bridegroom, one were to be introduced to a wife he never &s;aw before, it might be endured. But to go through all the terrors of a formal court|&s;hip, together with the epi&s;ode of aunts, grand|mothers and cou&s;ins, and at la&s;t to blurt out the broad &s;taring que&s;tion, of, <HI>madam will you marry me?</HI> No, no, that's &s;train much above me I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
