<L>WHEREE'ER Mankind to &s;acred freedom ju&s;t,</L>
<L>Have &s;oar'd above the groveling Sons of du&s;t,</L>
<L>Wheree'er the Arts their fragrant wreathes have wove,</L>
<L>Wheree'er the virtues leagued with Patriot love,</L>
<L>And bright-eyed Science &s;hed her heavenly dews,</L>
<L>There public ta&s;te hath nur&s;ed the Tragic Mu&s;e.</L>
<L>And Rea&s;on to her generous care con&s;ign'd,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis her's where human in&s;titutes are weak,</L>
<L>With firm, unbia&s;t empha&s;is to &s;peak.</L>
<L>With genuine nature link per&s;ua&s;ive art,</L>
<L>And bind in magic ties the willing heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She gives to view the Tyrant's naked brea&s;t,</L>
<L>What guilt di&s;turbs him, and what fears in&s;e&s;t.</L>
<L>She with abhorrence marks the Traitor's name,</L>
<L>And cloaths Ambition in the robes of Shame.</L>
<L>Depre&s;&s;es Cruelty; and rears on high</L>
<L>The &s;tandard of Imperial liberty.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is Innocence by rigour &s;tern &s;ubdued?</L>
<L>She &s;teels her &s;oul with con&s;cious fortitude.</L>
<L>Bids her above this fordid earth to ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And claim alliance with her native &s;kies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who then, by partial error led a&s;tray,</L>
<L>With ha&s;ty cen&s;ure brands the Tragic lay?</L>
<L>The glorious &s;trains which poli&s;h'd Athens taught,</L>
<L>Refining and exalting human thought?</L>
<L>When Sages prai&s;ed the Poet's moral pen?</L>
<L>And li&s;tening Heroes felt that they were Men?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What true de&s;ert is their's, at Virtue's call,</L>
<L>Who make th' obedient pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;e or fall!</L>
<L>Who in her Temple bid Mankind appear,</L>
<L>Breathe the warm &s;igh, and drop the hallow'd tear!</L>
<L>For when by idcot laughter unpo&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>She, gentle Godde&s;s, &s;eeks the &s;often'd brea&s;t.</L>
<L>From grief it&s;elf a namele&s;s plea&s;ure flows,</L>
<L>And pity loves to melt at fancied woes.</L>

<L>To climes remote our Briti&s;h Author &s;trays,</L>
<L>Not from th' Italian, or the French tran&s;lates,</L>
<L>Alters old plots, or even imitates.</L>
<L>From your own Annals he his &s;tory draws,</L>
<L>Tradition long hath crown'd it with applau&s;e.</L>
<L>When the fierce Danes their barbarous inroads plann'd,</L>
<L>And pour'd de&s;truction o'er each harra&s;t land.</L>
<L>When they be&s;ieged the&s;e Walls, and hoped to win,</L>
<L>Nor knew &s;uperior valour dwelt within:</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="4">Till the bold Citizens a&s;&s;ail'd their Ho&s;t,</L>
<L>And drove th' in&s;ulting Mi&s;creants from their Coa&s;t,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, for their Country, dared your Sires to bleed;</L>
<L>Nor have their Sons di&s;graced the gallant deed.</L>
<L>Courageous now, as when they quell'd the Dane,</L>
<L>Still faithful, loyal, generous, and humane.</L>

<LG>
<L>NO longer now in pomp of grief array'd,</L>
<L>No longer Editha, the Captive Maid;</L>
<L>Prepared t' examine this &s;ame Tragic &s;tory,</L>
<L>In my own per&s;on I advance before ye.</L>
<L>My critic art at lea&s;t this once to try,</L>
<L>And &s;can our Bard's defects with nice&s;t eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;ome apology th' attempt may need&mdash;</L>
<L>But by your looks embolden'd, I'll proceed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who, without terror, Rodolph's fury traces?</L>
<L>Why, tho' a Dane, was he refu&s;ed the Graces?</L>
<L>Were &s;uch the manners of tho&s;e Northern Climes?</L>
<L>Why not have bent them to our gentler times?</L>
<L>To &s;eek his Mi&s;tre&s;s' life!&mdash;So de&s;perate grown!&mdash;</L>
<L>He &s;hould have rather fled, and &s;aved his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Surely <HI>that</HI> Albert might have &s;poke more plain.</L>
<L>The City's Praefect&mdash;but my dying Swain.</L>
<L>Why had he not &s;ome crafty &s;cheme devi&s;ed?</L>
<L>And ventured 'mid the Dani&s;h camp di&s;gui&s;ed?</L>
<L>He &s;hould have crept, or &s;wam, or fought, or &s;trove,</L>
<L>And hazarded his tru&s;t&mdash;to gain his Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' affection of a Brother!&mdash;How mi&s;placed!</L>
<L>And what a violence to modern Ta&s;te!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A &s;oul defying death! and accents Roman!</L>
<L>How could <HI>they</HI> &s;uit with any Briti&s;h Woman!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The &s;imple, and the natural!&mdash;How &s;tupid!</L>
<L>I &s;hould have ran&s;ack'd all the &s;tores of Cupid.</L>
<L>Hopes, fears, doubts, jealou&s;ies, and warm de&s;ires,</L>
<L>Darts, arrows, daggers, poi&s;on'd bowls, and fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Are to a Tragic Piece my powers decreed?</L>
<L>Let it be great and Tragical indeed.</L>
<L>Let Pa&s;&s;ion cea&s;e the guiding rein t' obey,</L>
<L>Let Grief be &s;train'd to its &s;ublime&s;t key,</L>
<L>In frantic fury let me cur&s;e the light,</L>
<L>And die enchantingly, with all my might.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But egoti&s;ms and irony apart&mdash;</L>
<L>Say, have our Author's numbers touch'd the heart?</L>
<L>Have they from Pity &s;tole th' ingenuous &s;igh?</L>
<L>And rai&s;ed the trembling tear in Virtue's eye?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is th' unerring comment; this the te&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>And all remarks be&s;ides&mdash;like mine&mdash;a je&s;t.</L>
