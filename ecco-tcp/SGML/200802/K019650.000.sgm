<HEAD>A General Hi&s;tory OF TRADE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Promi&s;ed to Concern the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es as little as po&s;&s;ible with our Politicks, and with the Party Di&s;putes which are among us, and I'll keep my Word in it as well as it can be done; tho' I acknowledge it will be very Difficult to do &s;o, when to the Nations great Di&s;quiet, we are ju&s;t now al|mo&s;t going by the Bars about whether we &s;hall Trade to <HI>France</HI> or No.</P>
<P>It is Impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak of Trade in Gene|ral and leave out entirely the Trade to <HI>France,</HI> and I fear it will be impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>at lea&s;t to me,</HI> to &s;ay what may be nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid in order to &s;et the Trade to <HI>France</HI> in a Clear View, without being Charg'd with Leaning to one Side or other.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">Among the &s;everal Opinions about the Trade between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> I find none who have any true knowledge of the Trade in General, but what agree in this, That there ought to be &s;ome Trade opened with <HI>France</HI> &s;eeing we have made Peace with them; Likewi&s;e all agree, That Trade, &s;uch as it &s;hall be, ought to be Settled and Regu|lated by Articles and Agreements between the Nations, which is the thing we call a Treaty of Commerce.</P>
<P>Being thus agreed in the main Point, That &s;ome Trade mu&s;t and ought to be Settled, and that a Treaty of Commerce ought to be made; the Que&s;tion remaining in Debate &s;eems to be only, What degree of Trade with <HI>France</HI> &s;hall be entred into, and under what Regulations, Re&s;trictions, Duties and Prohibitions.</P>
<P>Some are of the Opinion, That the Trade to <HI>France</HI> has always been a Lo&s;ing Trade, and that it will be &s;o &s;till, and that as it lies at this time under Exce&s;&s;ive Duties it will be prevented from being &s;o, and that therefore all tho&s;e high Duties which are now lay'd upon the <HI>French</HI> Importations ought to re|main.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that as we have lay'd high Duties on the greate&s;t part of <HI>French</HI> Impor|tations here, by which the Quantities Import|ed will now be reduced: &s;o the <HI>French</HI> have Loaded our Woollen Manufactures, and other Exportations thither with &s;uch heavy Duties, or el&s;e with Total Prohibitions that effectually
<PB N="5" REF="4">
foreclo&s;e the Trade &s;o, That as you will Im|port little from <HI>France,</HI> you will Export le&s;s to <HI>France,</HI> and the Ballance will run again&s;t you wor&s;e in matters of Profit than it did before; the&s;e Men therefore are for taking off our high Duties on every Side, and leaving the Trade, as they &s;ay all Trade ought to be, Free and Un|burthened, except with &s;uch moderate Im|po&s;itions as may be no Grievance either to the Con&s;umer or the Importer.</P>
<P>But a third &s;ort &s;ay, there is a Nece&s;&s;ary Medium to be ob&s;erv'd in this Ca&s;e, and that &s;eeing an Opportunity is put into our Hands upon the Occa&s;ion of the Peace, to Settle this Trade to our Advantage, we ought to get all po&s;&s;ible Burthens taken off from our Manufactures and other Exports from hence in <HI>France,</HI> and yet at the &s;ame time keep on &s;uch part of our high Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Goods Im|ported here, as may be &s;ufficient to re&s;train their Importation in too great quantities, &s;o as to be prejudicial to our Trade in General, and cau&s;e an Over-ballance in the Trade to our Prejudice.</P>
<P>The People who have had the Guiding this Great Affair &s;ay they have done this, and the oppo&s;ite Party &s;ay they have not; one Side Challenges the other, THESE <HI>&s;ay,</HI> Trade is betray'd, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade ruin'd, the General Intere&s;t neglected, the Manufactures of <HI>England</HI> injur'd, and the <HI>French</HI> have too much Advantage; that they will Over-ballance us &s;till, and the Trade be yet to our lo&s;s: On the other hand THOSE <HI>&s;ay,</HI> they have Secured the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Commerce effectually
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to our Advantage, by Opening a Door to our Trade into <HI>France,</HI> having Obliged the <HI>Fr.</HI> King to take off all his Prohibitions and Additional Duties from our Importations <HI>there,</HI> back to the Tariff of 1664. and yet have &s;hut the Door again&s;t the quantity of their Importations here, by leaving on great part of the Additional Du|ties which the Trade was Loaded with during the War, &s;o that the Prices of their Goods, particularly their Wines, Brandy, Silks, Linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are the Principal part of their Importations here, will be &s;o great, by rea&s;on of tho&s;e Duties remaining on by this Treaty, that the Con&s;umption will of Cour&s;e be greatly &s;hort of what it was u&s;ually in tho&s;e times when, as the other alledge, their Importation &s;o much Encrea&s;ed and Overbal|lanc'd us. <HI>Again</HI> THESE <HI>&s;ay</HI> they have not left Duty enough on to le&s;&s;en the &s;aid Impor|tations; and that the Duties ought to have been &s;till Higher. THOSE <HI>&s;ay</HI> the Duties left are &s;ufficient; and that the Advantage is &s;uch, and &s;o great, as that they could not obtain any farther, nor indeed rea&s;onably in|&s;i&s;t upon laying higher Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods, unle&s;s they had at the &s;ame time Con&s;ented that &s;ome part of the high Duties in <HI>France</HI> &s;hould remain upon our Goods; which for the Encouragement of our Woollen Manufacture they thought it not proper to yield to, and they declare that they do think the high Duties which are to remain on <HI>French</HI> Goods here, are &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the Trade to the Advantage of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">If I can make any Judgment of the pre|&s;ent Di&s;pute, it is, as near as can be, wholly Compri&s;ed in this Abridgment: I &s;hall not enter here into any part of the Que&s;tion, it being the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Hi&s;tory of Trade, ra|ther to Relate than Decide the Di&s;pute. I am already Charg'd with being much farther Concern'd in the Difference than I really am; and I &s;hall therefore avoid Di&s;puting any thing here, but Impartially &s;tate the Que&s;tion, and lay down the &s;tate of the &s;everal Duties and Prohibitions on both Sides, as they are now, while the Treaty is in Su&s;pen&s;e and not made Effectual; and as they are to be, if the &s;aid Treaty is to take place; I &s;hall afterward &s;hew what the Difference is that will be be|tween the former Duties before the War, and tho&s;e, that if the Treaty take place, are to be the Settled Cu&s;toms of the Trade; and then &s;hall leave every Man, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e helps, to make a Judgment for him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>In order to this, and for the information of tho&s;e who, tho' not Imediately Ver&s;t in the Entries Out|wards and Inwards, or not &s;o much Ma&s;ter of the Book of Rates as to know every thing without a far|ther Enquiry, are yet willing to know in Conci&s;e Terms, on what Foot the Trade now &s;tands, and on what Foot it is to &s;tand, that they may not, as mo&s;t Men do, Di&s;pute without Book, and talk ra&s;hly, gi|ving their Judgment without any Knowledge of the matter.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, for the Information of &s;uch as the&s;e, I have &s;ubjoyned proper Tables of the &s;everal Duties on <HI>French</HI> Goods, as they now are, and as they are to be if the Treaty of Comerce takes place.</P>

<P><PB N="20" REF="19" MS="y">While the Trade of <HI>France</HI> &s;tood at a &s;tay, by rea&s;on of a &s;tated Prohibition during the War, the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> found the Demand for their Wines encrea&s;ed to a degree, that at fir&s;t their whole Kingdom could not &s;upply; but as the pro&s;pect of the War appeared like|ly to continue, and the Price the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gave for the Wines was very encouraging, the Vineyards encrea&s;ed every year to a very great degree, &s;o that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Produce of Wine ro&s;e from Five or Six Hundred Ton a year, to Seven or Eight Thou&s;and, as may ap|pear by the Import of the years &s;ince the War.</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be allowed on one &s;ide too in abatement of quantity, that there have been ways and means made u&s;e of to Import great quantities of <HI>French</HI> Wines under the denomination of <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Wines; al&s;o the <HI>Galitia</HI> Wines were, during the prohibition of Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> entred under the &s;ame Head; &s;o that we are not to &s;uppo&s;e all the Wines which are called <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Wines in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Books, to come really from <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>It happened about the year 1703, that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> being earne&s;tly &s;ollicited to break his Neutrality, and Joyn with the Con|federates in the late War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> the Confederates being willing almo&s;t upon any Terms to engage his <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Maje&s;ty; the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> tho' willing to Engage, yet took that occa&s;ion to make &s;uch Conditions, as were particularly for the advantage of his Subjects in Matters of Trade, and more e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="21" REF="20">
with relation to their Wines: They knew well enough that the demand for their Wines in <HI>England,</HI> was occa&s;ion'd only by the Prohibition afore&s;aid, which by the accident of the War, was lay'd upon <HI>French</HI> Wines; They knew al&s;o, that when ever the War came to a Conclu&s;ion, and that by a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> the Trade for the <HI>French</HI> Wines &s;hould be opened again in <HI>England,</HI> the De|mand for the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">tugal</HI> Wine would fall off again, and the <HI>French</HI> Wine would be the Common Draft of the Nation.</P>
<P>To prevent this, they enter into a Treaty with Mr. <HI>Methuen</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, for the keeping the Duties upon <HI>French</HI> Wine up to a certain height in <HI>England</HI> after a Peace, and that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine &s;hould always pay a certain proportion le&s;s than the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Methuen</HI> ventur'd to agree to this Trea|ty, and the Condition was, That the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> &s;hould take off all Prohibitions from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Clothes, and any other <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures which were then Prohibited in <HI>Portugal</HI>; the Tenour of the &s;aid Treaty, as it is Tran&s;lated in the Secretary's Offices here, is as follows: <HI>viz.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Her Sacred Royal Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> may, in her own and the Name of her Succe&s;&s;ors, be obliged at all times &s;o to admit into <HI>Britain</HI> the Wines made of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Vineyards, that at no time what|ever, whether there be Peace or War be|tween the Kingdoms of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="21">
any thing more may be demanded for the &s;aid Wines, under the name of Duty or Cu&s;toms, or any other Title whatever, directly or indirectly, than what the Third Part of the Duty or Cu&s;toms being de|ducted, &s;hall be demanded from an equal Quantity or Mea&s;ure of <HI>French</HI> Wine, whither tho&s;e Wines &s;hall be Imported into <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> by Hog&s;heads, or Barrels, or any other Ve&s;&s;els; but if this Abatement of Cu&s;toms, as is pre&s;umed to be made, &s;hall be after any manner prejudiced or Abo|li&s;hed, it &s;hall be Ju&s;t and Lawful for his Sacred Royal Maje&s;ty of <HI>Portugal,</HI> AGAIN to forbid the Woollen Cloaths, and the re&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures."</Q></P>
<P>This is the Occa&s;ion of the warm Di&s;putes among our Parties at this time, of which, without determining one way or other, or any way embarking the&s;e Tracts in that Di&s;|pute, I &s;hall give an Impartial Ab&s;tract, re|lating, as fairly as I can, the &s;tate of the Que&s;tion, and what either Party alledge for them&s;elves in their Defence of, or Objections again&s;t this Treaty.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ers of the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI> &s;ay, This is a fair, a ju&s;t, and a rea&s;onable Treaty; That it is Sign'd, Rati|fied, and Exchang'd with the King of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> and ought to be kept Sacred. Whereas on the other hand, they &s;ay, the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> without any regard to the Stipulations of this Treaty, and taking
<PB N="23" REF="22" MS="y">
no manner of notice of it, has effectually de&s;troyed and overthrown it, by agreeing to Reduce the Duties on <HI>French</HI> Wines to an Equallity with the Wines of like quality from other Countries, which by con&s;equence includes the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines which are of like quality with the <HI>French,</HI> and that therefore the <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty is thereby actually broken, the Faith and Honour of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation depreciated and forfeited, and that the Con|&s;equence of it will be, that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> will prohibit our Woollen Manufactures, nay, per|haps our whole Trade: Nay, &s;ome go farther, and alledge, that the Peace with <HI>Pottugal</HI> is actually broken by this Infraction, and that our Trade to <HI>Portugal,</HI> which is &s;o Con&s;ider|able and &s;o Advantageous, will be entirely lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I believe the Gentlemen cannot &s;ay, but that I have done ju&s;tice to their Allegations, and given their Objections their full length, and I hope they will allow me to do the like on the other Side.</P>
<P>The Advocates for the Treaty of Com|merce alledge, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Trade to <HI>Por|tugal</HI> &s;tands upon other Foundarions, that the Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France</HI> will have very little Influence upon it one way or other; That it is true, the Importation of Wine from <HI>Portugal</HI> will le&s;&s;en, tho' it is apparent that Importation will be greater many ways than ever it was before: But that our Exportation of Woollen Manufa|ctures to <HI>Portugal</HI> was ever very great, even
<PB N="24" REF="23" MS="y">
before the War, when the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines made no figure at all in the Trade, and were not in all above 2 or 300 Ton in a Year; That the Encrea&s;e of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade in the&s;e late years, did not take its ri&s;e from our De|mand of their Wines, and con&s;equently will not feel any &s;en&s;ible decay or decrea&s;e, tho' we were never to take any more Wine of them.</P>
<P>They farther alledge, That the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines will not be &s;o greatly run down by the <HI>French</HI> Wine as was formerly, the humour of our Nation running all upon &s;trong Wines for the&s;e &s;everal years; &s;o that it is ob&s;erve|able, that no <HI>French</HI> Wines are now in e&s;teem but the Rich high-priz'd Clarets, <HI>Puntacks,</HI> and &s;uch like; That the price of their &s;trong|e&s;t <HI>French</HI> Wines is always high, and their quantity but &s;mall; That the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wine will be bought at lea&s;t Ten or Twelve Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton Cheaper than tho&s;e Rich <HI>French</HI> Wines, and will be always wanted to make the Smaller <HI>French</HI> Wines Stronger, and the Pale <HI>French</HI> Wine Deeper, as was always the Ca&s;e when the Trade was open, on occa&s;ion of a bad Vintage in <HI>France</HI>; That altho' the Treaty with <HI>France</HI> does not pre&s;erve the Inequality of the Duty between the <HI>Portugal</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Wine, &s;o as to give the Ad|vantage to the fir&s;t, as was de&s;igned by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>; yet that the Inequality of the Price will always be an equivalent to it, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines being never bought at above 12<HI>l. per</HI> Ton, one with another; whereas
<PB N="25" REF="24">
the&s;e &s;ay, that the other Party have Printed, that the <HI>French</HI> Wine &s;hall always Co&s;t 25<HI>l. per</HI> Ton in <HI>France</HI> after the Peace.</P>
<P>Thus far they argue as to the Trade: As to the ju&s;tice of Breaking the Treaty with <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> that is a Ca&s;e by it &s;elf; the People who are for the <HI>French</HI> Commerce, an&s;wer that part, by falling upon the Treaty it &s;elf, and upon the People that made it; They &s;ay, it is a Treaty Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of <HI>Britain</HI> in its nature, and therefore is not to be kept, but is void of Cour&s;e, and by the Con|&s;equence of things; That he who made it, had he not been gone to an&s;wer it in another World, ought to have an&s;wer'd for it at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and ought to have been Im|peached of High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>They alledge that this Treaty Limits the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> by the Preroga|tive of the Crown, &s;tipulating, That the Parliament &s;hall not lay on any higher Duties than &s;uch and &s;uch mentioned in that Article, Pretending that a private Tran&s;action of a Mini&s;ter or Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hall be binding, and and Con&s;equently Superiour to the Parliament; and that it is in the Power of an Amba&s;&s;ador to tell the Parliament what Taxes they &s;hall not Lay, and by the &s;ame Rule may tell them what they &s;hall Lay, which is a Power de&s;tructive to the Being and Nature of Par|liaments, and cannot be done; That the Par|liament has alone the Power to Determin what Duties &s;hall, or &s;hall not, be Lay'd upon the Exportations and Importations of Mer|chandizes,
<PB N="26" REF="25">
as well as upon any other things, and no Inva&s;ion, that &s;hall be made, or at|tempted to be made, upon that Power, can be binding to the People of <HI>England</HI>; that on this Account, it cannot be any Inju&s;tice, or any Illegal Act for the Parliament to confirm any other Treaty, which &s;hall Contravene or Re&s;cind that Treaty.</P>
<P>Again, they add, That the Treaty carries, in the Body of it, an expre&s;s Suppo&s;ition, That the Parliament may &s;ee Rea&s;on to Con|travene, Break, or Re&s;cind it, and therefore makes Provi&s;ion for &s;uch an Incident in a Clau&s;e, which determins what it &s;hall be Lawful for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to do, if the &s;aid Treaty &s;hould be broken.</P>
<P>This they alledge al&s;o, amounts to an Ex|pre&s;s Stipulation, That the Breach of this Traty, &s;hall not be e&s;teem'd a Breach of the Peace between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI>; for that when it &s;ays particularly, what it &s;hall be Lawful for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> to do upon &s;uch a Breach, it &s;trongly implies, That it &s;hall not be Lawful for him to take any other mea&s;ures in that Ca&s;e, or carry his Re|&s;entment any farther than to the Prohibition of &s;uch and &s;uch Goods, as were Prohibited before.</P>
<P>Another Debate ari&s;es al&s;o from this &s;up|po&s;ed Infraction of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Treaty, by the new Treaty of Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) That one Party alledges, That it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, in ca&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> do not per|form their part, it &s;hall be Lawful for the King
<PB N="27" REF="26">
of <HI>Portugal</HI> to Prohibit the Woollen Cloth, <HI>caeteri&s;&abque; Lanificia,</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures.</P>
<P>The Advocates for the Treaty Object, That tho' it is true, that the Words of the Trea|ty do expre&s;s it, in that manner, <HI>caeteri&s;&abque; Lanificia</HI>; yet that the Word <HI>Rur&s;us</HI> Again, explains the meaning of it, That it &s;hall be Lawful for the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> Again to Prohibit, can &s;ignify nothing of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures, but what was Prohi|bited before.</P>
<P>Then it remains to examine, what <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures were Prohibited be|fore. One &s;ide affirms, that no more were formerly Prohibited, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Cloths, and challenges the other to name, what other Woollen Manufactures were Pro|hibited, which indeed they have not done, contenting them&s;elves to affirm, that there were other Woollen Manufactures Prohibited in <HI>Portugal,</HI> without &s;aying what they were.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Ca&s;e, is indeed, &s;ome|thing different, from what either Party pre|tend to. There were indeed &s;everal Pragma|ticks, as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call them, Publi&s;hed, as I take it, in the Years 1688, 1692, and 1697, and in other Years, which were made to prevent the People of <HI>Portugal</HI> running into the new Fa&s;hions, and change of Habits, according to the Cu&s;toms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain</HI>; in order to which, I &s;ay tho&s;e Pragmaticks were made to forbid, not the Importing only, but wearing any of the medly or mixt
<PB N="28" REF="27">
Cloths of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> or any other Country.</P>
<P>Whether the Words, <HI>caeteri&s;&abque; Lanificia,</HI> were in tho&s;e Pragmaticks or no, does not appear; neither have any &s;ide Quoted, Co|pied, or Tran&s;lated, either, or any of tho&s;e Pragmaticks, to &s;hew whether it was or not. On the other hand, it is certain, that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> did never refu&s;e to admit the Importation of any of our Woollen Manu|factures into <HI>Portugal,</HI> upon any pretence what&s;oever, except the &s;aid Medly Cloths; and this, I think, without being partial to either &s;ide, I may take for an A&s;&s;urance, that they were not Prohibited.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Nature of the Trade between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> is &s;uch, that altho' this Breach of the Clau&s;e &s;hould hap|pen, yet it does not &s;eem, that the Circum|&s;tances of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> would at all admit them to prohibit Commerce with <HI>England,</HI> or to Prohibit the Woollen Manufactures in general, as &s;ome People &s;ugge&s;t, and that on &s;everal Accounts; I &s;hall name but three, as I &s;aid before, becau&s;e I &s;hall not make the&s;e Tracts, which are de&s;ign'd to be Hi&s;torical chiefly, meddle at all with the Controver&s;y on either &s;ide.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Becau&s;e tho' we may not take off &s;o great a quantity of their Wines as we did before, yet that we &s;hould &s;till take off a very great quantity, and which it would be very well worth their while to di&s;po&s;e of.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="29" REF="28">2. That <HI>England</HI> is the only Market they have in the World, not for their Wines on|ly, but for the other capital Produce of their Country, &s;uch as Oil and Fruit, which if they &s;hould Prohibit a Trade with us, they could by no means find a vent for in any other Nation; the <HI>Dutch</HI> taking off but very few of them, and the <HI>French</HI> none at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That they are not able to carry on their Trade to <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> which is now encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a prodigious Degree, as from Eighteen or Twenty Two Sail of Ships to a Hundred and Forty Sail, neither without our Manu|factures, or without the &s;tocks of our Mer|chants, who &s;ell the greate&s;t part of their Goods, to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchants, to be paid at the return of the Fleet from the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I think however warm they are on both Sides in that part of the Quarrel, they Err in this, That they repre|&s;ent the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade to be much more at the Mercy of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> than it really is; or than con&s;i&s;ts with the Honour and Repu|tation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade to have it be.</P>
<P>If our Manufactures were not nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> they could not be induced to take off &s;uch a very great quantity yearly as they do, by the Argument of our taking off their Wines; for the utmo&s;t value of the Wines being not above Seventy or Eighty Thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> and the Export of our Woollen Manufactures amounting, as
<PB N="30" REF="29">
&s;ome &s;ay, to Eight Hundred Thou&s;and, and as others, to a Million of Pounds Sterling a year to <HI>Portugal,</HI> they would never make the taking off of Eight Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds in Wines, which is our part, be the Cau&s;e of their taking off a Million from us, which is their part, and pay the Nine Hun|dred and Twenty Thou&s;and Pound in Specie to procure it; this, I &s;ay, does not &s;eem ra|tional.</P>
<P>But the true &s;tate of the <HI>Portugal</HI> Trade &s;tands thus: Upon the late Treaty with <HI>Portugal,</HI> their King perceiving that by our prohibiting the Importation of <HI>French</HI> Wine, our de|mand for his Country Wines was mightily encrea&s;ed, and that the Profit to his Subjects was exceeding Great, by Planting more Vine|yards, and Encrea&s;ing the Vallue of the Lands, and by Con&s;equence of his Revenue; and likewi&s;e fore&s;eeing, that when-ever the <HI>French</HI> Trade &s;hould be opened again, that Demand for <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines would fall again, Contriv'd to bring the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> into a Treaty of Inequallity of Cu&s;tom, in favour of his Wines again&s;t the <HI>French, one third part,</HI> as by the Article quoted already appears; the Equiva|lent for this Favour was the taking off the Prohibition upon our Woollen Mixt Cloth, as afore&s;aid; but it does by no means &s;tand with the Circum&s;tances of the King of <HI>Por|tugal</HI>'s Subjects, or the Nature of their Com|merce, that if this Article cannot be pre|&s;erv'd, he &s;hould &s;top a Commerce, by which all the re&s;t of the Produce of his Country
<PB N="31" REF="30">
&s;hould be carried off and con&s;um'd; this would ruin the whole Commerce of his Kingdom, and be ten fold more Di&s;advantage to him one way, than it would be Advantage to him another.</P>
<P>Again, the quantity of <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines Imported hither, take them one year with another, have been about Seven Thou&s;and Ton a year; this cannot be entirely &s;unk, and I believe, if all was to happen that can happen by the Treaty, there cannot be le&s;s Imported into <HI>England,</HI> than one half of that quantity, the People being, as was noted above, en|clin'd &s;o much to &s;trong Wines, that the <HI>French</HI> Trade cannot fully An&s;wer their de|mand, and all the &s;mall thin Wines of <HI>Anjou,</HI> and the Banks of <HI>Loir,</HI> will now, probably, be little worth; &s;o that the <HI>Portugal</HI> Wines cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ink above one half; or &s;uppo&s;e it may be about Four Thou&s;and Ton, which is Forty Thou&s;and Pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> at Ten Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton, which Ten Pound <HI>per</HI> Ton in time of Peace, and open Trade, will be the top of the Market. Now it does not &s;eem rational to me, I &s;ay, <HI>to Me, for I &s;peak my private Opinion,</HI> That the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> &s;hould quarrel with <HI>England,</HI> Pro|hibit our Trade, put a &s;top to a current Demand of a Million <HI>per Annum</HI> Import, which pays him a very great Revenue, put a &s;top to the Con&s;umption of all the other Growth of his Country which we take off, &s;uch as Oil, Shumack, Figs, Salt, Fruit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Salt excepted, no Nation but the
<PB N="32" REF="31">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can take tho&s;e Goods off, and all this for want of our taking Forty Thou&s;and Pounds worth of Wine.</P>
<P>Add to this, That by this Method he would hinder the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> taking off the re|maining quantity of Wines al&s;o, which would be very con&s;iderable, and by the Calculation above, amounts to Forty Thou&s;and Pounds more; and &s;o thro' us, quite out of the Chan|nel of <HI>Port</HI> Wine, which, as it is now, the Draft will not ea&s;ily be altered, and the Advantage of the Con&s;umption is &s;o much the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> to pre&s;erve, that no one can &s;uppo&s;e they would be &s;o weak, as to throw it away, without &s;uffi|cient Ground.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I cannot &s;ee room to think, That &s;uppo&s;e the wor&s;t, nay, &s;uppo&s;ing all the Con&s;equences which People fear as to the <HI>French</HI> Trade interfering with the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI>; yet it not does &s;eem rea&s;onable to think, that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> will Prohibit any part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, much le&s;s the whole <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Trade, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>In this po&s;ture, the State of the Di&s;pute &s;eems to &s;tand, and as every one is left to determine in favour of tho&s;e who they ap|prove mo&s;t; &s;o I &s;hall not engage again&s;t one Side or other, but Mode&s;tly and Calmly give my Thoughts upon the whole.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;h'd, that Party and Pa&s;|&s;ion were left out of the&s;e Debates. Our Trade is an E&s;&s;ential Article, upon which the Felicity of the Nation very much de|pends,
<PB N="33" REF="32">
and which mu&s;t many ways receive an injury by the&s;e Ob&s;tructions; nay, the very Debating the&s;e things, awakens the Enemies of our Commerce, and lets them into &s;ome parts of the Di&s;pute, which they &s;hould rather be Ignorant of than know: <HI>For Example,</HI> <LIST>
<ITEM>1. While one Paper makes a very great &s;tir, and lays a va&s;t Weight upon the <HI>French</HI> falling upon our Manufactures, publi&s;hes how ea&s;ie it is for them to get away all our Trade, how they Work Cheaper, and perform their Work as well as the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that they are able, not only to &s;upply them&s;elves, but all the re&s;t of the World, nay, that they could come in upon us, and Under-&s;ell us at our own Doors; while they do thus, I &s;ay, they do an irreparable Injury to their own Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. On the other hand, While the oppo|&s;ite Paper publi&s;hes, the great Advantages of our Nation in the Treaty, over the <HI>French,</HI> and how it is in our hands, to make the <HI>French</HI> Trade be to the Gain of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;o many Thou&s;and Pounds a Year. This is alarming the <HI>French,</HI> and telling them we have made Fools of them in the Treaty, by which we &s;et them to Work to retrieve it by all po&s;&s;ible Methods; and perhaps, at la&s;t, to find &s;ome &s;hift to get out of the Noo&s;e, and turn the Advantage again&s;t us; things they are very dexterous in doing.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">To de&s;cend a little farther in the&s;e Parti|culars, and Di&s;cour&s;e them Impartially, with|out Reflecting either on one Party or another, It is my Judgment, that the Extremes on both the&s;e Sides, are very de&s;tructive at this time to the General Intere&s;t of Trade in <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion to be made, but the pre&s;erving the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Bri|tain,</HI> to be, as it ever was &s;ince we were fir&s;t Ma&s;ters of it, OUR OWN, Exclu&s;ive of all other Nations in the World, is our great Concern, our true Intere&s;t, and is what the Wealth and Pro&s;perity of this Nation really depends upon.</P>
<P>There is no que&s;tion to be made, but every Nation round us, who are capable to make any Progre&s;s in &s;uch an Attempt, will en|deavour as much as in them lies, to imi|tate us, in a thing &s;o prodigiou&s;ly Gainful: The <HI>Dutch</HI> do it, the <HI>Flemmings</HI> have always done it, and the <HI>French</HI> have been now above Seventy Year, making gradual &s;teps in it.</P>
<P>What indefatigable, re&s;tle&s;s Indu&s;try, what Severe Application, what all po&s;&s;ible Encou|ragement from their Government, what their own nece&s;&s;ity, which is the Spring of Inven|tion, is able to do: This is not wanting, nor has been wanting in <HI>France,</HI> during the long Reign of the mo&s;t Politick and Potent Prince <HI>France</HI> ever knew, and they do all a Na|tion in their Circum&s;tances can do, to come to a Perfection in the Woollen Manufactures.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">But they Labour under in&s;uperable Difficul|ties, and &s;truggle with invincible Ob&s;tacles, which &s;mother the Flame of their Indu&s;try, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the want of Wooll; this is the main Ca&s;e, and as Nature has it not, the Soil, the Clime does not produce it, they, by con|&s;equence, cannot have it, but by the &s;upply from us; nor are they wanting in their Ap|plication to get the Wooll from us, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in <HI>England,</HI> they Rummage, e|very Creek, and every Corner, run all Ri&s;ques, Buy, Bribe, Fetch and Carry, do all that de&s;perate Dilligence can do to get our Wooll, and too much Succe&s;s they have in their endeavour.</P>
<P>But when all is done that can be done, the Wooll they get cannot be a quantity &s;uitable to the Demand, or &s;ufficient to carry on a National Manufacture; and al&s;o it mu&s;t be dearer by much than our Manufacturers have it at Home; the Expence, the Hazard, the Hands employ'd, the Freights, the Lo&s;&s;es, all go into the Price of that which arives, and is made u&s;e of; then the Carriage when Land|ed, for Conveying it to Remote Places; this all adds to the Price, and is a damp upon the Manufactures, which it is not po&s;&s;ible to avoid, and which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give the great Ad|vantage to our People, who have the Wooll at their own Doors.</P>
<P>I cannot doubt, but our Government, may in time find out &s;ome better Method, than is yet put in practice, for the re&s;training this Export of Wooll, and for the putting a check
<PB N="36" REF="35">
upon the <HI>French</HI> Manufactures the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble way; for nothing is more evedent, than that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll were effectually kept at Home, the <HI>French</HI> could never go on with their Manufacturing to any con&s;iderable degree, and the Government cannot but think it for the publick Service to have all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i|&s;tance to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Tract, to en|quire, what are the e&s;pecial Grievances of this Article, and why a Nation, to who&s;e Intere&s;t it is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to prevent the Exportation of their Wooll, &s;hould at the &s;ame time have the Laws for that purpo&s;e &s;o ill Executed, as that in almo&s;t every part of the Kingdom the Wooll is carried Abroad, not with allowance, <HI>we cannot &s;ay that,</HI> but with an open Violence, and even &s;ometimes by Force and Blood, &s;e|veral Murthers, Fightings, and Breakings of the Peace, having hapned upon this Occa&s;ion in many Parts: As if the <HI>French</HI> were come to that pa&s;s, either of In&s;olence in Dealing with us, or nece&s;&s;ity of their own Side, that they were re&s;olved to fetch away our Wooll by Force; to this end they make little De&s;cents and Inva&s;ions upon us, &s;uch I may rightly call them, for the carrying off our Wooll, Arm'd either with Money to draw, or Wea|pons to drive tho&s;e, who, in Di&s;charge of their Duty and Office, appear to oppo&s;e them. This is &s;o well known, that I need not enter into Particulars, or enquire, where, when, and in what manner it is done.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">It is &s;ufficient to &s;ay by way of Com|plaint, That the Exportation of Wooll from Her Maje&s;ty's Dominions is now &s;o great, that unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy method be taken to redre&s;s this Grievance, and to put a &s;top to it, we may &s;oon &s;hake hands with our Foreign Trade, and &s;ee our Neighbours rivalling our Manufactures in a manner, which otherwi&s;e they could not hope to do.</P>
<P>There are four Vents by which our Wooll is now Unhappily carried out of the Country, (<HI>viz.</HI>) 1. <HI>Rumney-Mar&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> which has been the Place made famous for many Years for that Wicked Trade, and where it was carried on, even during all the late War, with a Corre&s;pon|dence, like that of a Neutrality, as if the In|habitants of <HI>Normandy</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> had made a Ce&s;&s;ation, or were two Neutral Nations, not concern'd in the War on either &s;ide; and as in the time of War, that corrupt Commerce was carried on, tho' not to &s;o great a Degree as formerly, &s;o much more now the Peace is made, is it renewed to a Degree equal to whatever it was before the War.</P>
<P>Next to this, is the Coa&s;t of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as in the other parts, the <HI>French,</HI> practice the &s;ame thing, and have done &s;o for a long time, tho' never with &s;o Open and Bare-fac'd a Confederacy as they do now, and where the <HI>French</HI> Boats have found the way to &s;hare with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as a Coa&s;t, altho' farther off from their own, yet where they are not in Danger of the Crui&s;ers and Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="37">
Ve&s;&s;els, who are employ'd on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;eize them at Sea.</P>
<P>But here, as &s;oon as the &s;aid Wooll is on Board, they are Safe, and bending their Cour&s;e directly over for <HI>Holland,</HI> they keep along that Shore to <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> as they &s;ee Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I may in time, enter upon a more particular Enquiry into this part of that Corrupt Trade, and how it is managed on Shore, to the En|riching a few private Men, but to the Impo|veri&s;hing the Nation; and which, if it be not prevented, will, in a few Years, make a vi&s;i|ble Alteration in the Face of our Trade.</P>
<P>The next Outlet for our Wooll has been in <HI>Scotland</HI>: Before the Union of the two Kingdoms, the Exportation of their Wooll was free and allowed by their Law; and al|beit, their own Wooll was not &s;o much de|&s;ired in <HI>France,</HI> as being too Coar&s;e for their Manufactures; yet they found a great Market for it in &s;everal parts of <HI>France,</HI> for their meaner &s;ort of Goods. But this was not all, as the Border of <HI>Scotland,</HI> adjoyning to <HI>England,</HI> was extended a great way from <HI>Berwick</HI> to <HI>Cali&s;le,</HI> for above Sixty Miles, it was not po&s;&s;ible to keep the Pa&s;&s;ages &s;o well guarded, but that great quantities of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll were frequently, and almo&s;t daily, carried in Hor&s;e Packs, by private ways into <HI>Scotland:</HI> In this Work they were generally &s;o well at|tended, that altho' it was often di&s;covered, by the Officers, yet they could not, without
<PB N="39" REF="38">
more a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;eize upon it; and before &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be procur'd, the Drivers of the Wooll, would get their Hor&s;es over the Border, when the Officers, altho' they &s;tood in view, had no more Power to act; &s;o that by this means the quantity of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wooll Exported into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence into <HI>France,</HI> was very great, nor was there any way to pre|vent it.</P>
<P>After the Union, the &s;ame Laws of Trade taking place in both Countries, the Wooll could no more be Exported from <HI>Scotland</HI> but by Stealth: But the Laws of that kind being very difficult to be Executed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Rea&s;on of the innumerable Number of Creeks and Coves along that Coa&s;t, the &s;mall Num|ber of Officers, their remote Stations from one another, their &s;mall Salaries, little En|couragement, and the ea&s;yne&s;s of carrying the Wooll un&s;u&s;pected to the Sea Coa&s;t; the Exportation of Wooll, is now carri|ed on in that Country to an extravagant De|gree, and it is not ea&s;y to prevent the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Article of this kind is <HI>Ireland,</HI> and here indeed, Wooll, &s;eems to be one of the Principle Commodities of the Country. They Export it to <HI>France,</HI> not as if it was Prohibited, but rather as if it was the allowed Traffick of the Place: Whole Ships are Freighted with it, they are known when at Sea, by their being &s;o light in their Loading; and our Sailors &s;ay to one another as they pa&s;s them at Sea, <HI>There goes an</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>O&V;LER.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="39">This is farther Demon&s;trable, from the &s;trange Change that is made in the Face of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Trade, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That whereas they crowded in their Wooll &s;o fa&s;t upon us in <HI>England,</HI> that our People com|plain'd of the Glut of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wooll, and that it &s;unk the Price of our own Wooll, which for want of a Trade, lay much on our Hand; now for the&s;e two Years pa&s;t, the ca&s;e is quite changed, and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wooll is not to be had for Money.</P>
<P>What can be the Rea&s;on of this? We know the quantity is not Dimin&s;hed, nor is the Trade Encrea&s;ed, that <HI>Ireland</HI> can Manufacture it at Home, and &s;o cannot &s;pare it for Exportation, that would be good news for <HI>Ireland</HI>; but the Truth of the Ca&s;e is what I am upon above, <HI>viz.</HI> That the quantity goes off another way, the Channel is turn'd, they have a Secret Vent to <HI>France,</HI> and there goes away the Wooll.</P>
<P>No Man need &s;eek any farther for a Rea&s;on why, or an Account how, the <HI>French</HI> came to be Arrived at &s;o great a Perfection in our Manu|factures, and to make &s;uch great quantities as it is &s;aid they do; here is the true Rea&s;on, and till this be prevented, it will never be otherwi&s;e; whereas, if the &s;tream of Wooll were &s;topt from <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which are the Fountains, the <HI>French</HI> would never be in any Condition to do us any con&s;iderable Damage of that kind; for they really have not the Materials, they have not Wooll, neither can any part of the World &s;upply them.</P>
<P>The next Tract of this Kind, &s;hall enquire far|ther into this part of Trade, and make &s;ome E&s;&s;ay at a Method to prevent, at lea&s;t le&s;&s;en, the Exportation of our Wooll, &s;o as that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hall not be able to break in upon our Trade; and then if the new Treaty of Commerce does really, as its Defenders alledge, open the Door of Trade, by taking off the Impo&s;itions upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen Manufactures in <HI>France,</HI> it may be a means to recover our Trade in <HI>France,</HI> and render all the Attempts of Manufacturing in <HI>France,</HI> A+bortive and Ineffectual.</P>
