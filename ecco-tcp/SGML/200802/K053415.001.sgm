</ARGUMENT>
<P>I BELIEVE it is difficult for tho&s;e who publi&s;h their own memoirs to e&s;cape the imputation of vanity; nor is this
<PB N="2" REF="25">
the only di&s;advantage under which they labour: it is al&s;o their misfortune, that what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with di&s;gu&s;t, and to charge the writer with impertinence. People generally think tho&s;e memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or &s;triking events; tho&s;e, in &s;hort, which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others they con&s;ign to con|tempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confe&s;s, not a little hazardous in a private and ob&s;cure individual, and a &s;tranger too, thus to &s;olicit the indul|gent attention of the public; e&s;pecially when I own I offer here the hi&s;tory of neither a &s;aint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are a few events in my life, which have not happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and, did I con&s;ider my&s;elf an European,
<PB N="3" REF="26">
I might &s;ay my &s;ufferings were great: but when I compare my lot with that of mo&s;t of my countrymen, I regard my&s;elf as a <HI>particular favourite of Hea|ven,</HI> and acknowledge the mereies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the following narrative does not appear &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to engage general attention, let my motive be &s;ome excu&s;e for its publica|tion. I am not &s;o &s;ooli&s;hly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputation. If it affords any &s;atis&s;action to my numerous friends, at who&s;e reque&s;t it has been written, or in the &s;malle&s;t degree promotes the intere&s;ts of humanity, the ends for which it was undertaken will be fully attained, and every wi&s;h of my heart grati&s;ied. Let it therefore be remem|bered, that, in wi&s;hing to avoid cen&s;ure, I do not a&s;pire to prai&s;e.</P>

That part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade for &s;laves is carried on, extends along the coa&s;t above 3400 miles, from Se|negal to Angola, and includes a vari|ety of kingdoms. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the kingdom of Benin, both as to extent and wealth, the richne&s;s and cultivation of the &s;oil, the power of its king, and the number and warlike di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabi|tants. It is &s;ituated nearly under the line, and extends along the coa&s;t about 170 miles, but runs back into the in|tertior part of Africa to a di&s;tance hi|therto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and &s;eems only terminated at length by the empire of Aby&s;&s;inia, near 1500 miles from its beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or di&s;tricts: in one of the mo&s;t remote and fertile of which,
<PB N="5" REF="28">
I was born, in the year 1745, &s;itu|ated in a charming fruitful vale, named E&s;&s;aka. The di&s;tance of this province from the capital of Benin and the &s;ea coa&s;t mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable; for I had never heard of white men or Europeans, nor of the &s;ea; and our &s;ubjection to the king of Benin was little more than nominal; for every tran&s;action of the government, as far as my &s;lender ob&s;ervation extended, was conducted by the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and govern|ment of a people who have little com|merce with other countries are gene|rally very &s;imple; and the hi&s;tory of what pa&s;&s;es in one family or village, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the whole nation. My father was one of tho&s;e elders or chiefs I have &s;poken of, and was &s;tyled Embrench&eacute;; a term, as I remember, importing the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, and
<PB N="6" REF="29">
&s;ignifying in our language a <HI>mark</HI> of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the per&s;on entitled to it, by cutting the &s;kin acro&s;s at the top of the forehead, and drawing it down to the eye-brows; and while it is in this &s;ituation apply|ing a warm hand, and rubbing it until it &s;hrinks up into a thick <HI>weal</HI> acro&s;s the lower part of the forehead. Mo&s;t of the judges and &s;enators were thus marked; my father had long borne it: I had &s;een it conferred on one of my brothers, and I al&s;o was <HI>de&s;tined</HI> to receive it by my parents. Tho&s;e Em|brench&eacute; or chief men, decided di&s;putes and puni&s;hed crimes; for which pur|po&s;e they always a&s;&s;embled together. The proceedings were generally &s;hort; and in mo&s;t ca&s;es the law of retaliation prevailed. I remember a man was brought before my father, and the other judges, for kidnapping a boy;
<PB N="7" REF="30">
and, although he was the &s;on of a chief or &s;enator, he was condemned to make recompen&s;e by a man or woman &s;lave. Adultery, however, was &s;ometimes pu|ni&s;hed with &s;lavery or death; a puni&s;h|ment which I believe is inflicted on it throughout mo&s;t of the nations of Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Benezet's "Account of Guinea" throughout.</NOTE>: &s;o &s;acred among them is the honour of the marriage bed, and &s;o jealous are they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an in&s;tance&mdash;a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and delivered over, as the cu&s;tom was, to her hu&s;band to be puni&s;hed. Accordingly he deter|mined to put her to death: but it being found, ju&s;t before her execution, that &s;he had an infant at her brea&s;t; and no woman being prevailed on to perform the part of a nur&s;e, &s;he was &s;pared on
<PB N="8" REF="31">
account of the child. The men, how|ever, do not pre&s;erve the &s;ame con|&s;tancy to their wives, which they ex|pect from them; for they indulge in a plurality, though &s;eldom in more than two. Their mode of marriage is thus:&mdash;both parties are u&s;ually be|trothed when young by their parents, (though I have known the males to betroth them&s;elves). On this occa&s;ion a fea&s;t is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom &s;tand up in the mid&s;t of all their friends, who are a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e, while he declares &s;he is thenceforth to be looked upon as his wife, and that no other per&s;on is to pay any addre&s;&s;es to her. This is al&s;o immediately proclaimed in the vici|nity, on which the bride retires from the a&s;&s;embly. Some time after &s;he is brought home to her hu&s;band, and then another fea&s;t is made, to which
<PB N="9" REF="32">
the relations of both parties are in|vited: her parents then deliver her to the bridegroom, accompanied with a number of ble&s;&s;ings, and at the &s;ame time they tie round her wai&s;t a cotton &s;tring of the thickne&s;s of a goo&s;e-quill, which none but married women are permitted to wear: &s;he is now con&s;i|dered as completely his wife; and at this time the dowry is given to the new married pair, which generally con&s;i&s;ts of portions of land, &s;laves, and cattle, hou&s;ehold goods, and imple|ments of hu&s;bandry. The&s;e are of|fered by the friends of both parties; be&s;ides which the parents of the bride|groom pre&s;ent gifts to tho&s;e of the bride, who&s;e property &s;he is looked upon before marriage; but after it &s;he is e&s;teemed the &s;ole property of her hu&s;band. The ceremony being now ended the fe&s;tival begins, which is
<PB N="10" REF="33">
celebrated with bonefires, and loud acclamations of joy, accompanied with mu&s;ic and dancing.</P>
<P>We are almo&s;t a nation of dancers, mu&s;icians, and poets. Thus every great event, &s;uch as a triumphant return from battle, or other cau&s;e of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with &s;ongs and mu&s;ic &s;uited to the occa&s;ion. The a&s;|&s;embly is &s;eperated into four divi&s;ions, which dance either apart or in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and each with a character pe|culiar to it&s;elf. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion contains the married men, who in their dances frequently exhibit feats of arms, and the repre&s;entation of a battle. To the&s;e &s;ucceed the married women, who dance in the &s;econd di|vi&s;ion. The young men accupy the third: and the maidens the fourth. Each repre&s;ents &s;ome intere&s;ting &s;cene
<PB N="11" REF="34">
of real life, &s;uch as a great achievement, dome&s;tic employment, a pathetic &s;tory, or &s;ome rural &s;port; and as the &s;ubject is generally founded on &s;ome recent event, it is therefore ever new. This gives our dances a &s;pirit and variety which I have &s;carcely &s;een el&s;ewhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I was in Smyrna I have frequently &s;een the Greeks dance after this manner.</NOTE>. We have many mu&s;ical in&s;truments, particularly drums of different kinds, a piece of mu&s;ic which re&s;embles a guitar, and another much like a &s;tickado. The&s;e la&s;t are chiefly u&s;ed by betrothed virgins, who play on them on all grand fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>As our manners are &s;imple, our luxuries are few. The dre&s;s of both &s;exes is nearly the &s;ame. It generally con&s;i&s;ts of a long piece of calico, or mu&s;lin, wrapped loo&s;ely round the body, &s;omewhat in the form of a
<PB N="12" REF="35">
highland plaid. This is u&s;ually dyed blue, which is our favorite colour. It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and richer than any I have &s;een in Europe. Be&s;ides this, our wo|men of di&s;tinction wear golden orna|ments, which they di&s;po&s;e with &s;ome profu&s;ion on their arms and legs. When our women are not employed with the men in tillage, their u&s;ual occupation is &s;pinning and weaving cotton, which they afterwards dye, and make into garments. They al&s;o manufacture earthen ve&s;&s;els, of which we have many kinds. Among the re&s;t tobacco pipes, made after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, as tho&s;e in Turkey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bowl is earthen, curiou&s;ly figured, to which a long reed is fixed as a tube. This tube is &s;ometimes &s;o long as to be borne by one, and fre|quently out of grandeur, by two boys.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Our manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are unac|quainted
<PB N="13" REF="36">
with tho&s;e refinements in cookery which debauch the ta&s;te: bul|locks, goats, and poultry, &s;upply the greate&s;t part of their food. The&s;e con&s;titute likewi&s;e the principal wealth of the country, and the chief articles of its commerce. The fle&s;h is u&s;ually &s;tewed in a pan; to make it &s;avoury we &s;ometimes u&s;e al&s;o pepper, and other &s;pices, and we have &s;alt made of wood a&s;hes. Our vegetables are mo&s;tly plan|tains, eadas, yams, beans, and Indian corn. The head of the family u&s;ually eats alone; his wives and &s;laves have al&s;o their &s;eparate tables. Before we ta&s;te food we always wa&s;h our hands: indeed our cleanline&s;s on all occa&s;ions is extreme; but on this it is an indi&s;|pen&s;ible ceremony. After wa&s;hing, libation is made, by pouring out a &s;mall portion of the drink on the floor, and to&s;&s;ing a &s;mall quantity of the food
<PB N="14" REF="37">
in a certain place, for the &s;pirits of departed relations, which the natives &s;uppo&s;e to pre&s;ide over their conduct, and guard them from evil. They are totally unacquainted with &s;trong or &s;pirituous liquors; and their principal beverage is palm wine. This is got from a tree of that name, by tap|ping it at the top, and fa&s;tening a large gourd to it; and &s;ometimes one tree will yield three or four gallons in a night. When ju&s;t drawn it is of a mo&s;t delicious &s;weetne&s;s; but in a few days it acquires a tarti&s;h and more &s;pirituous flavour: though I never &s;aw any one intoxicated by it. The &s;ame tree al&s;o produces nuts and oil. Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one &s;ort of the&s;e is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a &s;mall portion of which thrown
<PB N="15" REF="38">
into the fire diffu&s;es a mo&s;t powerful odour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I was in Smyrna I &s;aw the &s;ame kind of earth, and brought &s;ome of it with me to England; it re&s;embles mu&s;k in &s;trength, but is more delicious in &s;cent, and is not unlike the &s;mell of a ro&s;e.</NOTE>. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women per|fume them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In our buildings we &s;tudy conve|nience rather than ornament. Each ma&s;ter of a family has a large &s;quare piece of ground, &s;urrounded with a moat or fence, or enclo&s;ed with a wall made of red earth tempered: which, when dry, is as hard as brick. Within this are his hou&s;es to accommodate his family and &s;laves; which, if numer|ous, frequently pre&s;ent the appearance of a village. In the middle &s;tands the principal building, appropriated to the &s;ole u&s;e of the ma&s;ter, and con&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="16" REF="39">
of two apartments; in one of which he &s;its in the day with his family, the other is left apart for the reception of his friends. He has be&s;ides the&s;e a di&s;tinct apartment in which he &s;leeps, together with his male children. On each &s;ide are the apartments of his wives, who have al&s;o their &s;eparate day and night hou&s;es. The habitations of the &s;laves and their families are di&s;|tributed throughout the re&s;t of the en|clo&s;ure. The&s;e hou&s;es never exceed one &s;tory in height: they are always built of wood, or &s;takes driven into the ground, cro&s;&s;ed with wattles, and neatly pla&s;tered within and without. The roof is thatched with reeds. Our day|hou&s;es are left open at the &s;ides; but tho&s;e in which we &s;leep are always co|vered, and pla&s;tered in the in&s;ide, with a compo&s;ition mixed with cow|dung, to keep off the different in&s;ects,
<PB N="17" REF="40">
which annoy us during the night. The walls and floors al&s;o of the&s;e are generally covered with mats. Our beds con&s;i&s;t of a platform, rai&s;ed three or four feet from the ground, on which are laid &s;kins, and different parts of a &s;pungy tree called plantain. Our covering is calico or mu&s;lin, the &s;ame as our dre&s;s. The u&s;ual &s;eats are a few logs of wood; but we have benches, which are generally perfumed, to ac|commodate &s;trangers: the&s;e compo&s;e the greater part of our hou&s;ehold furniture. Hou&s;es &s;o con&s;tructed and furni&s;hed require but little &s;kill to erect them. Every man is a &s;u&s;&s;icient architect for the purpo&s;e. The whole neighbourhood afford their unanimous a&s;&s;i&s;tance in building them, and in return receive, and expect no other recompen&s;e than a fea&s;t.</P>
<P>As we live in a country where nature
<PB N="18" REF="41">
is prodigal of her favours, our wants are few and ea&s;ily &s;upplied; of cour&s;e we have few manufactures. They con|&s;i&s;t for the mo&s;t part of calicoes, earthen ware, ornaments, and in&s;tru|ments of war and hu&s;bandry. But the&s;e make no part of our commerce, the principal articles of which, as I have ob&s;erved, are provi&s;ions. In &s;uch a &s;tate, money is of little u&s;e; however we have &s;ome &s;mall pieces of coin, if I may call them &s;uch. They are made &s;omething like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or denomination. We have al&s;o markets, at which I have been frequently with my mother. The&s;e are &s;ometimes vi|&s;ited by &s;tout mahogany-coloured men from the &s;outh we&s;t of us: we call them <HI>Oye-Eboe,</HI> which term &s;ignifies red men living at a di&s;tance. They gene|rally bring us fire-arms, gunpowder,
<PB N="19" REF="42">
hats, beads, and dried fi&s;h. The la&s;t we e&s;teemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and &s;prings. The&s;e articles they barter with us for odoriferous woods and earth, and our &s;alt of wood a&s;hes. They always carry &s;laves through our land; but the &s;trict|e&s;t account is exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are &s;uffered to pa&s;s. Sometimes indeed we &s;old &s;laves to them, but they were only pri&s;oners of war, or &s;uch among us as had been convicted of kidnapping, or adultery, and &s;ome other crimes, which we e&s;teemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to think, that, notwith&s;tanding all our &s;trictne&s;s, their principal bu&s;ine&s;s among us was to trepan our people. I remember too they carried great &s;acks along with them, which not long after I had an
<PB N="20" REF="43">
opportunity of fatally &s;eeing applied to that infamous purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Our land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of vege|tables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and va&s;t quan|tities of cotton and tobacco. Our pine apples grow without culture; they are about the &s;ize of the large&s;t &s;ugar-loaf, and &s;inely flavoured. We have al&s;o &s;pices of different kinds, particularly pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never &s;een in Europe; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance. All our in|du&s;try is exerted to improve tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of nature. Agriculture is our chief employment; and every one, even the children and women, are engaged in it. Thus we are all habituated to labour from our earlie&s;t years. Every one contributes &s;omething to the com|mon
<PB N="21" REF="44">
&s;tock; and as we are unacquainted with idlene&s;s, we have no beggars. The benefits of &s;uch a mode of living are obvious. The We&s;t India planters prefer the &s;laves of Benin or Eboe, to tho&s;e of any other part of Guinea, for their hardine&s;s, intelligence, integrity, and zeal. Tho&s;e benefits are felt by us in the general healthine&s;s of the people, and in their vigour and acti|vity; I might have added too in their comeline&s;s. Deformity is indeed un|known among&s;t us, I mean that of &s;hape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe now in London, might be brought in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion: for, in regard to complexion, ideas of beauty are wholly relative. I remember while in Africa to have &s;een three negro chil|dren, who were tawny, and another quite white, who were univer&s;ally re|garded by my&s;elf, and the natives in
<PB N="22" REF="45">
general, as far as related to their com|plexions, as deformed. Our women too were in my eyes at lea&s;t uncommonly graceful, alert, and mode&s;t to a degree of ba&s;hfulne&s;s; nor do I remember to have ever heard of an in&s;tance of inconti|nence among&s;t them before marriage. They are al&s;o remarkably cheerful. Indeed cheerfulne&s;s and affability are two of the leading characteri&s;tics of our nation.</P>
<P>Our tillage is exerci&s;ed in a large plain or common, &s;ome hours walk from our dwellings, and all the neigh|bours re&s;ort thither in a body. They u&s;e no bea&s;ts of hu&s;bandry; and their only in&s;truments are hoes, axes, &s;hovels, and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with. Sometimes we are vi&s;ited by locu&s;ts, which come in large clouds, &s;o as to darken the air, and de&s;troy our harve&s;t. This however happens rarely, but when
<PB N="23" REF="46">
it does, a famine is produced by it. I remember an in&s;tance or two where|in this happened. This common is often the theatre of war; and therefore when our people go out to till their land, they not only go in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a &s;urpri&s;e; and when they apprehend an inva&s;ion, they guard the avenues to their dwellings, by driving &s;ticks into the ground, which are &s;o &s;harp at one end as to pierce the foot, and are generally dipt in poi&s;on. From what I can recollect of the&s;e battles, they appear to have been irrup|tions of one little &s;tate or di&s;trict on the other, to obtain pri&s;oners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by tho&s;e traders who brought the Euro|pean goods I mentioned among&s;t us. Such a mode of obtaining &s;laves in Africa is common; and I believe more
<PB N="24" REF="47">
are procured this way, and by kidnap|ing, than any other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Benezet's Account of Africa throughout.</NOTE>. When a trader wants &s;laves, he applies to a chief for them, and tempts him with his wares. It is not extraordinary, if on this occa|&s;ion he yields to the temptation with as little firmne&s;s, and accepts the price of his fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlightened merchant. Accordingly he falls on his neighbours, and a de&s;perate battle en&s;ues. If he prevails and takes pri&s;oners, he gratifies his avarice by &s;elling them; but, if his party be vanqui&s;hed, and he falls into the hands of the enemy, he is put to death: for, as he has been known to foment their quarrels, it is thought dangerous to let him &s;urvive, and no ran&s;om can &s;ave him, though all other pri&s;oners may be redeemed. We have fire|arms, bows and arrows, broad two|edged
<PB N="25" REF="48">
&s;words and javelins: we have &s;hields al&s;o which cover a man from head to foot. All are taught the u&s;e of the&s;e weapons; even our women are warriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole di&s;|trict is a kind of militia: on a certain &s;ignal given, &s;uch as the firing of a gun at night, they all ri&s;e in arms and ru&s;h upon their enemy. It is perhaps &s;ome|thing remarkable, that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them. I was once a witne&s;s to a battle in our common. We had been all at work in it one day as u&s;ual, when our people were &s;ud|denly attacked. I climbed a tree at &s;ome di&s;tance, from which I beheld the &s;ight. There were many wo|men as well as men on both &s;ides; among others my mother was there, and armed with a broad &s;word. After
<PB N="26" REF="49">
fighting for a con&s;iderable time with great fury, and many had been kil|led, our people obtained the victory, and took their enemy's Chief pri&s;oner. He was carried off in great triumph, and, though he offered a large ran&s;om for his life, he was put to death. A virgin of note among our enemies had been &s;lain in the battle, and her arm was expo&s;ed in our market-place, where our trophies were always exhibited. The &s;poils were divided according to the merit of the warriors. Tho&s;e pri&s;oners which were not &s;old or re|deemed we kept as &s;laves: but how different was their condition from that of the &s;laves in the We&s;t Indies! With us they do no more work than other members of the community, even their ma&s;ter; their food, clothing and lodging were nearly the &s;ame as theirs, (except that they were not permitted
<PB N="27" REF="50">
to eat with tho&s;e who were free-born); and there was &s;carce any other differ|ence between them, than a &s;uperior degree of importance which the head of a family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in our &s;tate, and that authority which, as &s;uch, he ex|erci&s;es over every part of his hou&s;ehold.

<P>As to religion, the natives believe that there is one Creator of all things, and that he lives in the &s;un, and is girted round with a belt that he may never eat or drink; but, according to &s;ome, he &s;mokes a pipe, which is our own favourite luxury. They believe he governs events, e&s;pecially our deaths or captivity; but, as for the doctrine of eternity, I do not remember to have ever heard of it: &s;ome however be|lieve in the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls in

a certain degree. Tho&s;e &s;pirits, which are not tran&s;migrated, &s;uch as their dear friends or relations, they believe al|ways attend them, and guard them from the bad &s;pirits or their foes. For this rea&s;on they always before eating, as I have ob&s;erved, put &s;ome &s;mall portion of the meat, and pour &s;ome of their drink, on the ground for them; and they often make oblations of the blood of bea&s;ts or fowls at their graves. I was very fond of my mother, and al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly with her. When &s;he went to make the&s;e oblations at her mother's tomb, which was a kind of &s;mall &s;olitary thatched hou&s;e, I &s;ome|times attended her. There &s;he made her libations, and &s;pent mo&s;t of the night in cries and lamentations. I have been often extremely terrified on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions. The loneline&s;s of the place, the darkne&s;s of the night, and the cere|mony
<PB N="29" REF="52">
of libation, naturally awful and gloomy, were heightened by my mo|ther's lamentations; and the&s;e concur|ring with the doleful cries of birds, by which the&s;e places were frequented, gave an inexpre&s;&s;ible terror to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>We compute the year from the day on which the &s;un cro&s;&s;es the line, and on its &s;etting that evening, there is a general &s;hout throughout the land; at lea&s;t I can &s;peak from my own know|ledge, throughout our vicinity. The people at the &s;ame time make a great noi&s;e with rattles, not unlike the ba&s;ket rattles u&s;ed by children here, though much larger, and hold up their hands to heaven for a ble&s;&s;ing. It is then the greate&s;t offerings are made; and tho&s;e children whom our wi&s;e men foretel will be fortunate are then pre|&s;ented to different people. I remember
<PB N="30" REF="53">
many u&s;ed to come to &s;ee me, and I was carried about to others for that purpo&s;e. They have many offerings, particularly at full moons; generally two at harve&s;t before the fruits are taken out of the ground: and when any young animals are killed, &s;ome|times they offer up part of them as a &s;acrifice. The&s;e offerings, when made by one of the heads of a family, &s;erve for the whole. I remember we often had them at my father's and my uncle's, and their families have been pre&s;ent. Some of our offerings are eaten with bitter herbs. We had a &s;aying among us to any one of a cro&s;s temper, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That if they were to be eaten, they &s;hould be eaten with bitter herbs.'</Q></P>
<P>We practi&s;ed circumci&s;ion like the Jews, and made offerings and fea&s;ts on that occa&s;ion in the &s;ame manner as they did. Like them al&s;o, our
<PB N="31" REF="54">
children were named from &s;ome event, &s;ome circum&s;tance, or fancied forebod|ing at the time of their birth. I was named <HI>Olaudah,</HI> which, in our language, &s;ignifies vici&s;&s;itude, or fortunate al&s;o; one favoured, and having a loud voice and well &s;poken. I remember we never polluted the name of the object of our adoration; on the contrary, it was always mentioned with the greate&s;t re|verence; and we were totally unac|quainted with &s;wearing, and all tho&s;e terms of abu&s;e and reproach which find their way &s;o readily and copiou&s;ly into the language of more civilized people. The only expre&s;&s;ions of that kind I remember were, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'May you rot, or may you &s;well, or may a bea&s;t take you.'</Q></P>
<P>I have before remarked that the natives of this part of Africa are ex|tremely cleanly. This nece&s;&s;ary habit

of decency was with us a part of reli|gion, and therefore we had many puri|fications and wa&s;hings; indeed almo&s;t as many, and u&s;ed on the &s;ame occa|&s;ions, if my recollection does not fail me, as the Jews. Tho&s;e that touched the dead at any time were obliged to wa&s;h and purify them&s;elves before they could enter a dwelling-hou&s;e. Every wo|man too, at certain times, was forbidden to come into a dwelling-hou&s;e, or touch any per&s;on, or any thing we eat. I was &s;o fond of my mother I could not keep from her, or avoid touching her at &s;ome of tho&s;e periods, in con&s;equence of which I was obliged to be kept out with her, in a little hou&s;e made for that purpo&s;e, till offering was made, and then we were purified.</P>

whether they had different offices, or whether they were united in the &s;ame per&s;ons, but they were held in great reverence by the people. They calculated our time, and foretold events, as their name imported, for we called them Ah-affoe-way-cah, which &s;ignifies calculators or yearly men, our year being called Ah-affoe. They wore their beards, and when they died they were &s;uceeded by their &s;ons. Mo&s;t of their implements and things of value were interred along with them. Pipes and tobacco were al&s;o put into the grave with the corp&s;e, which was al|ways perfumed and ornamented, and animals were offered in &s;acrifice to them. None accompanied their fune|rals but tho&s;e of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion or tribe. The&s;e buried them after &s;un&s;et, and always returned from the grave by

The natives are extremely cautions about poi&s;on.

Some of our &s;nakes, however, were poi&s;onous: one of them cro&s;&s;ed the road one day as I was &s;tanding on it, and pa&s;&s;ed between my feet without offering to touch me, to the great &s;urpri&s;e of many who &s;aw it; and the&s;e incidents were accounted by the wi&s;e men, and likewi&s;e by my mother and the re&s;t of the people, as remark|able omens in my favour.</P>
<P>Such is the imperfect &s;ketch my
<PB N="38" REF="61">
memory has furni&s;hed me with of the manners and cu&s;toms of a people among whom I fir&s;t drew my breath. And here I cannot forbear &s;ugge&s;ting what has long &s;truck me very forcibly, namely, the &s;trong analogy which even by this &s;ketch, imperfect as it is, appears to prevail in the manners and cu&s;toms of my countrymen and tho&s;e of the Jews, before they reached the Land of Promi&s;e, and particularly the patriarchs while they were yet in that pa&s;toral &s;tate which is de&s;cribed in Gene&s;is&mdash;an ana|logy, which alone would induce me to think that the one people had &s;prung from the other. Indeed this is the opinion of Dr. Gill, who, in his commentary on Gene&s;is, very ably de|duces the pedigree of the Africans from Afer and Afra, the de&s;cendants of Abraham by Keturah his wife and concubine (for both the&s;e titles are

applied to her). It is al&s;o conformable to the &s;entiments of Dr. John Clarke, formerly Dean of Sarum, in his Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion: both the&s;e authors concur in a&s;cribing to us this original. The rea&s;onings of tho&s;e gen|tlemen are &s;till further confirmed by the &s;cripture chronology; and if any further corroboration were required, this re&s;emblance in &s;o many re&s;pects is a &s;trong evidence in &s;upport of the opinion. Like the I&s;raelites in their primitive &s;tate, our government was conducted by our chiefs or judges, our wi&s;e men and elders; and the head of a family with us enjoyed a &s;imilar authority over his hou&s;ehold with that which is a&s;cribed to Abraham and the other patriarchs. The law of retalia|tion obtained almo&s;t univer&s;ally with us as with them: and even their religion appeared to have &s;hed upon us a ray of
<PB N="40" REF="63">
its glory, though broken and &s;pent in its pa&s;&s;age, or eclip&s;ed by the cloud with which time, tradition, and igno|rance might have enveloped it; for we had our circumci&s;ion (a rule I believe peculiar to that people:) we had al&s;o our &s;acrifices and burnt-offer|ings, our wa&s;hings and purifications, on the &s;ame occa&s;ions as they had.</P>

<P>I have already acquainted the reader with the time and place of my birth. My father, be&s;ides many &s;laves, had a numerous family, of which &s;even lived to grow up, including my&s;elf and a &s;i&s;ter; who was the only daughter. As I was the younge&s;t of the &s;ons, I be|came, of cour&s;e, the greate&s;t favourite with my mother, and was always with her; and &s;he u&s;ed to take particular
<PB N="47" REF="70">
pains to form my mind. I was trained up from my earlie&s;t years in the art of war: my daily exerci&s;e was &s;hooting and throwing javelins; and my mother adorned me with emblems, after the manner of our greate&s;t warriors. In this way I grew up till I was turned the age of eleven, when an end was put to my happine&s;s in the following manner:&mdash;Generally when the grown people in the neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour the children a&s;&s;embled together in &s;ome of the neighbours' premi&s;es to play; and commonly &s;ome of us u&s;ed to get up a tree to look out for any a&s;&s;ailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us; for they &s;ome|times took tho&s;e opportunities of our parents ab&s;ence to attack and carry off as many as they could &s;eize. One day, as I was watching at the top of a tree in our yard, I &s;aw one of tho&s;e people
<PB N="48" REF="71">
come into the yard of our next neigh|bour but one, to kidnap, there being many &s;tout young people in it. Imme|diately on this I gave the alarm of the rogue, and he was &s;urrounded by the &s;toute&s;t of them, who entangled him with cords, &s;o that he could not e&s;cape till &s;ome of the grown people came and &s;ecured him. But alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus attacked, and to be carried off, when none of the grown people were nigh. One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as u&s;ual, and only I and my dear &s;i&s;ter were left to mind the hou&s;e, two men and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment &s;eized us both, and, without giving us time to cry out, or make re&s;i&s;tance, they &s;topped our mouths, and ran off with us, into the neare&s;t wood. Here they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as
<PB N="49" REF="72">
far as they could, till night came on, when we reached a &s;mall hou&s;e, where the robbers halted for refre&s;hment and &s;pent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowered by fatigue and grief, our only relief was &s;ome &s;leep, which allayed our misfortune for a &s;hort time. The next morning we left the hou&s;e, and con|tinued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the woods, but at la&s;t we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had now &s;ome hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little way before I di&s;|covered &s;ome people at a di&s;tance, on which I began to cry out for their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me fa&s;ter and &s;top my mouth, and then they put me into a large &s;ack. They al&s;o
<PB N="50" REF="73">
&s;topped my &s;i&s;ter's mouth, and tied her hands; and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the &s;ight of the&s;e people. When we went to re&s;t the following night they offered us &s;ome victuals; but we refu&s;ed it; and the only comfort we had was in being in one another's arms all that night, and bathing each other with our tears. But alas! we were &s;oon de|prived of even the &s;mall comfort of weeping together. The next day proved a day of greater &s;orrow than I had yet experienced; for my &s;i&s;ter and I were then &s;eparated, while we lay cla&s;ped in each others arms. It was in vain that we be&s;ought them not to part us; &s;he was torn from me, and immediately carried away, while I was left in a &s;tate of di&s;traction not to be de&s;cribed. I cried and grieved con|tinually; and for &s;everal days, did not
<PB N="51" REF="74">
eat any thing but what they forced into my mouth. At length, after many days travelling, during which I had often changed ma&s;ters, I got into the hands of a chieftain, in a very plea&s;ant country. This man had two wives and &s;ome children, and they all u&s;ed me extremely well, and did all they could to comfort me; particu|larly the fir&s;t wife, who was &s;omething like my mother. Although I was a great many days journey from my father's hou&s;e, yet the&s;e people &s;poke exactly the &s;ame language with us. This fir&s;t ma&s;ter of mine, as I may call him, was a &s;mith, and my prin|cipal employment was working his bellows, which were the &s;ame kind as I had &s;een in my vicinity. They were in &s;ome re&s;pects not unlike the &s;toves here in gentlemen's kitchens; and were covered over with leather; and in the
<PB N="52" REF="75">
middle of that leather a &s;tick was fixed, and a per&s;on &s;tood up, and worked it, in the &s;ame manner as is done to pump water out of a ca&s;k with a hand pump. I believe it was gold he worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was worn by the women on their wri&s;ts and ancles. I was there I &s;uppo&s;e about a month, and they at la&s;t u&s;ed to tru&s;t me &s;ome little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. This liberty I u&s;ed in embracing every opportunity to inquire the way to my own home: and I al&s;o &s;ometimes, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, went with the maidens, in the cool of the evenings, to bring pitchers of water from the &s;prings for the u&s;e of the hou&s;e. I had al&s;o re|marked where the &s;un ro&s;e in the morn|ing, and &s;et in the evening, as I had travelled along; and I had ob&s;erved that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> father's hou&s;e was towards the
<PB N="53" REF="76">
ri&s;ing of the &s;un. I therefore deter|mined to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of making my e&s;cape, and to &s;hape my cour&s;e for that quarter; for I was quite oppre&s;&s;ed and weighed down by grief after my mother and friends; and my love of liberty, ever great, was &s;trengthened by the mortifying cir|cum&s;tance of not daring to eat with the free-born children, although I was mo&s;tly their companion. While I was projecting my e&s;cape, one day an un|lucky event happened, which quite di&s;concerted my plan, and put an end to my hopes. I u&s;ed to be &s;ometimes employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting an elderly woman &s;lave, to cook and take care of the poultry: and one morning, while I was feeding &s;ome chickens, I happened to to&s;s a &s;mall pebble at one of them, which hit it on the middle, and direct|ly killed it. The old &s;lave, having
<PB N="54" REF="77">
&s;oon after mi&s;&s;ed the chicken, inquired after it; and on my relating the acci|dent (for I told her the truth, becau&s;e my mother would never &s;uffer me to tell a lie) &s;he flew into a violent pa&s;|&s;ion, threatened that I &s;hould &s;uffer for it; and, my ma&s;ter being out, &s;he immediately went and told her mi&s;tre&s;s what I had done. This alarm|ed me very much, and I expected an in&s;tant flogging, which to me was uncommonly dreadful; for I had &s;el|dom been beaten at home. I therefore re&s;olved to fly; and accordingly I ran into a thicket that was hard by, and hid my&s;elf in the bu&s;hes. Soon af|terwards my mi&s;tre&s;s and the &s;lave returned, and, not &s;eeing me, they &s;earched all the hou&s;e, but not finding me, and I not making an&s;wer when they called to me, they thought I ad run away, and the whole neigh|bourhood
<PB N="55" REF="78">
was rai&s;ed in the pur&s;uit of me. In that part of the country (as in ours) the hou&s;es and villages were &s;kirted with woods, or &s;hrubberies, and the bu&s;hes were &s;o thick that a man could readily conceal him&s;elf in them, &s;o as to elude the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch. The neighbours continued the whole day looking for me, and &s;everal times many of them came within a few yards of the place where I lay hid. I ex|pected every moment, when I heard a ru&s;tling among the trees, to be found out, and puni&s;hed by my ma&s;ter: but they never di&s;covered me, though they were often &s;o near that I even heard their conjectures as they were looking about for me; and I now learned from them, that any attempt to return home would be hopele&s;s. Mo&s;t of them &s;uppo&s;ed I had fled towards home;
<PB N="56" REF="79">
but the di&s;tance was &s;o great, and the way &s;o intricate, that they thought I could never reach it, and that I &s;hould be lo&s;t in the woods. When I heard this I was &s;eized with a violent panie, and abandoned my&s;elf to de&s;pair. Night too began to approach, and ag|gravated all my fears. I had before entertained hopes of getting home; and had determined when it &s;hould be dark to make the attempt; but I was now convinced it was fruitle&s;s, and began to con&s;ider that, if po&s;&s;ibly I could e&s;cape all other animals, I could not tho&s;e of the human kind; and that, not knowing the way, I mu&s;t peri&s;h in the woods. Thus was I like the hunted deer:<Q><L>&mdash;"Ev'ry leaf and ev'ry whi&s;p'ring breath</L>
<L>"Convey'd a foe, and ev'ry foe a death."</L></Q></P>
<P>I heard frequent ru&s;tlings among the leaves; and being pretty &s;ure they were
<PB N="57" REF="80">
&s;nakes, I expected every in&s;tant to be &s;tung by them. This increa&s;ed my angui&s;h, and the horror of my &s;ituation became now quite in&s;upportable. I at length quitted the thicket, very &s;aint and hungry, for I had not eaten or drank any thing all the day; and crept to my ma&s;ter's kitchen, from whence I &s;et out at fir&s;t, and which was an open &s;hed, and laid my&s;elf down in the a&s;hes with an anxious wi&s;h for death to relieve me from all my pains. I was &s;carcely awake in the morning, when the old woman &s;lave, who was the fir&s;t up, came to light the fire, and &s;aw me in the fire place. She was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me, and could &s;carcely believe her own eyes. She now promi&s;ed to intercede for me, and went for her ma&s;ter, who &s;oon after came, and, having &s;lightly reprimanded
<PB N="58" REF="81">
me, ordered me to be taken care of, and not ill treated.</P>
<P>Soon after this my ma&s;ter's only daughter, and child by his fir&s;t wife, &s;ickened and died, which affected him &s;o much that for &s;ome time he was almo&s;t frantic, and really would have killed him&s;elf, had he not been watch|ed and prevented. However, in a &s;mall time afterwards he recovered, and I was again &s;old. I was now carried to the left of the &s;un's ri&s;ing, through many dreary wa&s;tes and di&s;mal woods, amid&s;t the hideous roarings of wild bea&s;ts. The people I was &s;old to u&s;ed to carry me very often, when I was tired, either on their &s;houlders or on their backs. I &s;aw many convenient well-built &s;heds along the road, at proper di&s;tances, to accom|modate the merchants and travellers, who lay in tho&s;e buildings along with
<PB N="59" REF="82">
their wives, who often accompany them; and they always go well armed.</P>
<P>From the time I left my own nation I always found &s;omebody that under|&s;tood me till I came to the &s;ea coa&s;t. The languages of different nations did not totally differ, nor were they &s;o co|pious as tho&s;e of the Europeans, par|ticularly the Engli&s;h. They were therefore ea&s;ily learned; and, while I was journeying thus through Africa, I acquired two or three different tongues. In this manner I had been travelling for a con&s;iderable time, when one evening to my great &s;ur|pri&s;e, whom &s;hould I &s;ee brought to the hou&s;e where I was but my dear &s;i&s;ter! As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me &s;he gave a loud &s;hriek, and ran into my arms&mdash;I was quite overpowered: neither of us could &s;peak; but, for a con&s;iderable time,
<PB N="60" REF="83">
clung to each other in mutual embraces, unable to do any thing but weep. Our meeting affected all who &s;aw us; and indeed I mu&s;t acknowledge, in honour of tho&s;e &s;able de&s;troyers of human rights, that I never met with any ill treatment, or &s;aw any offered to their &s;laves, except tying them, when ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to keep them from running away. When the&s;e people knew we were brother and &s;i&s;ter, they indulged us to be together; and the man, to whom I &s;uppo&s;ed we belonged, lay with us, he in the middle, while &s;he and I held one another by the hands acro&s;s his brea&s;t all night; and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes in the joy of being together: but even this &s;mall comfort was &s;con to have an end; for &s;carcely had the fatal morning appear|ed, when &s;he was again torn from me for ever! I was now more mi&s;erable,
<PB N="61" REF="84">
if po&s;&s;ible, than before. The &s;mall relief which her pre&s;ence gave me from pain was gone, and the wretchedne&s;s of my &s;ituation was redoubled by my anxiety after her fate, and my appre|hen&s;ions le&s;t her &s;ufferings &s;hould be greater than mine, when I could not be with her to alleviate them. Yes, thou dear partner of all my childi&s;h &s;ports! thou &s;harer of my joys and &s;orrows! happy &s;hould I have ever e&s;teemed my&s;elf to encounter every mi&s;ery for you, and to procure your freedom by the &s;acrifice of my own. Though you were early forced from my arms, your image has been always rivetted in my heart, from which neither <HI>time nor fortune</HI> have been able to re|move it; &s;o that, while the thoughts of your &s;ufferings have damped my pro&s;perity, they have mingled with adver&s;ity and increa&s;ed its bitterne&s;s.
<PB N="62" REF="85">
To that Heaven which protects the weak from the &s;trong, I commit the care of your innocence and virtues, if they have not already received their full reward, and if your youth and delicacy have not long &s;ince fallen vic|tims to the violence of the African trader, the pe&s;tilential &s;tench of a Guinea &s;hip, the &s;ea&s;oning in the Euro|pean colonies, or the la&s;h and lu&s;t of a brutal and unrelenting over&s;eer.</P>
<P>I did not long remain after my &s;i&s;ter. I was again &s;old, and carried through a number of places, till, after travelling a con&s;iderable time, I came to a town called Tinmah, in the mo&s;t beautiful country I had yet &s;een in Africa. It was extremely rich, and there were many rivulets which flowed through it, and &s;upplied a large pond in the centre of the town, where the people wa&s;hed. Here I fir&s;t &s;aw and ta&s;ted cocoa nuts,
<PB N="63" REF="86">
which I thought &s;uperior to any nuts I had ever ta&s;ted before; and the trees, which were loaded, were al&s;o inter&s;per&s;|ed among&s;t the hou&s;es, which had com|modious &s;hades adjoining, and were in the &s;ame manner as ours, the in&s;ides being neatly pla&s;tered and whitewa&s;hed, Here I al&s;o &s;aw and ta&s;ted for the fir&s;t time &s;ugar-cane. Their money con&s;i&s;ted of little white &s;hells, the &s;ize of the fin|ger nail. I was &s;old here for one hundred and &s;eventy-two of them by a merchant who lived and brought me there. I had been about two or three days at his hou&s;e, when a wealthy widow, a neighbour of his, came there one even|ing, and brought with her an only &s;on, a young gentleman about my own age and &s;ize. Here they &s;aw me; and, having taken a fancy to me, I was bought of the merchant, and went home with them. Her hou&s;e and
<PB N="64" REF="87">
premi&s;es were &s;ituated clo&s;e to one of tho&s;e rivulets I have mentioned, and were the fine&s;t I ever &s;aw in Africa: they were very exten&s;ive, and &s;he had a number of &s;laves to attend her. The next day I was wa&s;hed and perfumed, and when meal-time came, I was led into the pre&s;ence of my mi&s;tre&s;s, and eat and drank before her with her &s;on. This filled me with a&s;toni&s;hment; and I could &s;carce help expre&s;&s;ing my &s;ur|pri&s;e that the young gentleman &s;hould &s;uffer me, who was bound, to eat with him who was free; and not only &s;o, but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till I had taken fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e. I was the elde&s;t, which was agreeable to our cu&s;tom. Indeed every thing here, and all their treatment of me, made me forget that I was a &s;lave. The language of the&s;e people re&s;em|bled ours &s;o nearly, that we under&s;tood
<PB N="65" REF="88">
each other perfectly. They had al&s;o the very &s;ame cu&s;toms as we. There were likewi&s;e &s;laves daily to attend us, while my young ma&s;ter and I with other boys &s;ported with our darts and bows and arrows, as I had been u&s;ed to do at home. In this re&s;emblance to my former happy &s;tate, I pa&s;&s;ed about two months; and I now began to think I was to be adopted into the family, and was beginning to be re|conciled to my &s;ituation, and to for|get by degrees my misfortunes, when all at once the delu&s;ion vani&s;hed; for, without the lea&s;t previous knowledge, one morning early, while my dear ma&s;ter and companion was &s;till a&s;leep, I was awakened out of my reverie to fre&s;h &s;orrow, and hurried away even among&s;t the uncircumci&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus, at the very moment I dreamed of the greate&s;t happine&s;s, I found my|&s;elf
<PB N="66" REF="89">
mo&s;t mi&s;erable; and it &s;eemed as if fortune wi&s;hed to give me this ta&s;te of joy, only to render the rever&s;e more poignant. The change I now expe|rienced was as painful as it was &s;udden and unexpected. It was a change in|deed from a &s;tate of bli&s;s to a &s;cene which is inexpre&s;&s;ible by me, as it di&s;covered to me an element I had never before beheld, and till then had no idea of, and wherein &s;uch in&s;tances of hard&s;hip and cruelty continually oc|curred as I can never reflect on but with horror.</P>
<P>All the nations and people I had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed through re&s;embled our own in their manners, cu&s;toms, and language: but I came at length to a country, the inhabitants of which differed from us in all tho&s;e particulars. I was very much &s;truck with this dif|ference, e&s;pecially when I came among
<PB N="67" REF="90">
a people who did not circumci&s;e, and eat without wa&s;hing their hands. They cooked al&s;o in iron pots, and had Euro|pean cutla&s;&s;es and cro&s;s bows, which were unknown to us, and fought with their fi&s;ts among&s;t them&s;elves. Their women were not &s;o mode&s;t as ours, for they eat, and drank, and &s;lept, with their men. But above all, I was amazed to &s;ee no &s;acrifices or offerings among them. In &s;ome of tho&s;e places the people ornamented them&s;elves with &s;cars, and likewi&s;e filed their teeth very &s;harp. They wanted &s;ometimes to ornament me in the &s;ame manner, but I would not &s;uffer them; hoping that I might &s;ome time be among a people who did not thus disfigure them|&s;elves, as I thought they did. At la&s;t I came to the banks of a large river, which was covered with canoes, in which the people appeared to live
<PB N="68" REF="91">
with their hou&s;ehold uten&s;ils and pro|vi&s;ions of all kinds. I was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;hed at this, as I had never before &s;een any water larger than a pond or a rivulet: and my &s;urpri&s;e was mingled with no &s;mall fear when I was put into one of the&s;e canoes, and we began to paddle and move along the river. We continued going on thus till night; and when we came to land, and made fires on the banks, each family by them&s;elves, &s;ome dragged their canoes on &s;hore, others &s;tayed and cooked in theirs, and laid in them all night. Tho&s;e on the land had mats, of which they made tents, &s;ome in the &s;hape of little hou&s;es: in the&s;e we &s;lept: and after the morning meal, we em|barked again and proceeded as before. I was often very much a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;ome of the women, as well as the men, jump into the water, dive to the
<PB N="69" REF="92">
bottom, come up again, and &s;wim about. Thus I continued to travel, &s;ometimes by land, &s;ometimes by water, through different countries and various nations, till, at the end of &s;ix or &s;even months after I had been kidnapped, I arrived at the &s;ea coa&s;t. It would be tedious and unintere&s;ting to relate all the incidents which befell me dur|ing this journey, and which I have not yet forgotten; of the various hands I pa&s;&s;ed through, and the manners and cu&s;toms of all the different people among whom I lived: I &s;hall there|fore only ob&s;erve, that in all the places where I was, the &s;oil was exceedingly rich; the pomkins, aedas, plantains, yams, &amp;c. &amp;c. were in great abund|ance, and of incredible &s;ize. There were al&s;o va&s;t quantities of different gums, though not u&s;ed for any pur|po&s;e; and every where a great deal of
<PB N="70" REF="93">
tobacco. The cotton even grew quite wild; and there was plenty of red-wood. I &s;aw no mechanics whatever in all the way, except &s;uch as I have men|tioned. The chief employment in all the&s;e countries was agriculture, and both the males and females, as with us, were brought up to it, and trained in the arts of war.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object which &s;aluted my eyes when I arrived on the coa&s;t was the &s;ea, and a &s;lave &s;hip, which was then riding at anchor, and waiting for its cargo. The&s;e filled me with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, which was &s;oon converted into terror when I was carried on board. I was immediately handled, and to&s;&s;ed up to &s;ee if I were &s;ound, by &s;ome of the crew; and I was now per|&s;uaded that I had gotten into a world of bad &s;pirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions too
<PB N="71" REF="94">
differing &s;o much from ours, their long hair, and the language they &s;poke, (which was very different from any I had ever heard) united to confirm me in this belief. Indeed &s;uch were the horrors of my views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thou&s;and world, had been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have exchanged my condition with that of the meane&s;t &s;lave in my own country. When I look|ed round the &s;hip too and &s;aw a large furnace or copper boiling, and a mul|titude of black people of every de&s;crip|tion chained together, every one of their countenances expre&s;&s;ing dejection and &s;orrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and, quite overpowered with horror and angui&s;h, I fell motionle&s;s on the deck and fainted. When I recovered a little I found &s;ome black people about me, who I believed were
<PB N="72" REF="95">
&s;ome of tho&s;e who brought me on board, and had been receiving their pay; they talked to me in order to cheer me, but all in vain. I a&s;ked them if we were not to be eaten by tho&s;e white men with horrible looks, red faces, and long hair. They told me I was not: and one of the crew brought me a &s;mall portion of &s;piritu|ous liquor in a wine gla&s;s; but, being afraid of him, I would not take it out of his hand. One of the blacks there|fore took it from him and gave it to me, and I took a little down my palate, which, in&s;tead of reviving me, as they thought it would, threw me into the greate&s;t con&s;ternation at the &s;trange feeling it produced, having never ta&s;ted any &s;uch liquor before. Soon after this the blacks who brought me on board went off, and left me abandoned to de&s;pair. I now &s;aw my&s;elf deprived
<PB N="73" REF="96">
of all chance of returning to my native country, or even the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of hope of gaining the &s;hore, which I now con&s;idered as friendly; and I even wi&s;hed for my former &s;lavery in pre|ference to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, &s;till heightened by my ignorance of what I was to undergo. I was not long &s;uffered to indulge my grief; I was &s;oon put down under the decks, and there I received &s;uch a &s;alutation in my no&s;trils as I had never expe|rienced in my life: &s;o that, with the loath&s;omene&s;s of the &s;tench, and crying together, I became &s;o &s;ick and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the lea&s;t de&s;ire to ta&s;te any thing. I now wi&s;hed for the la&s;t friend, death, to relieve me; but &s;oon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eat|ables; and, on my refu&s;ing to eat,
<PB N="74" REF="97">
one of them held me fa&s;t by the hands, and laid me acro&s;s, I think the windla&s;s, and tied my feet, while the other flogged me &s;everely. I had never experienced any thing of this kind before; and al|though not being u&s;ed to the water, I naturally feared that element the fir&s;t time I &s;aw it, yet neverthele&s;s, could I have got over the nettings, I would have jumped over the &s;ide, but I could not; and, be&s;ides, the crew u&s;ed to watch us very clo&s;ely who were not chained down to the decks, le&s;t we &s;hould leap into the water: and I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e poor African pri|&s;oners mo&s;t &s;everely cut for attempting to do &s;o, and hourly whipped for not eating. This indeed was often the ca&s;e with my&s;elf. In a little time after, among&s;t the poor chained men, I found &s;ome of my own nation, which in a &s;mall degree gave ea&s;e to my mind. I
<PB N="75" REF="98">
inquired of the&s;e what was to be done with us? they gave me to under&s;tand we were to be carried to the&s;e white people's country to work for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if it were no wor&s;e than working, my &s;ituation was not &s;o de&s;perate: but &s;till I feared I &s;hould be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as I thought, in &s;o &s;avage a manner; for I had never &s;een among any people &s;uch in&s;tances of brutal cruelty; and this not only &s;hewn towards us blacks, but al&s;o to &s;ome of the whites them|&s;elves. One white man in particular I &s;aw, when we were permitted to be on deck, flogged &s;o unmercifully with a large rope near the forema&s;t, that he died in con&s;equence of it; and they to&s;&s;ed him over the &s;ide as they would have done a brute. This made me fear the&s;e people the more; and I ex|pected
<PB N="76" REF="99">
nothing le&s;s than to be treated in the &s;ame manner. I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my fears and apprehen&s;ions to &s;ome of my countrymen: I a&s;ked them if the&s;e people had no country, but lived in this hollow place (the &s;hip)? they told me they did not, but came from a di&s;tant one. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Then,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'how comes it in all our country we never heard of them?'</Q> They told me becau&s;e they lived &s;o very far off. I then a&s;ked where were their women? had they any like them&s;elves? I was told they had: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And why,'</Q> &s;aid I, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'do we not &s;ee them?'</Q> they an&s;wered, becau&s;e they were left behind. I a&s;ked how the ve&s;&s;el could go? they told me they could not tell; but that there were cloth put upon the ma&s;ts by the help of the ropes I &s;aw, and then the ve&s;&s;el went on; and the white men had &s;ome &s;pell or magic they put in the water
<PB N="77" REF="100">
when they liked in order to &s;top the ve&s;&s;el. I was exceedingly amazed at this account, and really thought they were &s;pirits. I therefore wi&s;hed much to be from among&s;t them, for I ex|pected they would &s;acrifice me: but my wi&s;hes were vain; for we were &s;o quartered that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any of us to make our e&s;cape. While we &s;tayed on the coa&s;t I was mo&s;tly on deck; and one day, to my great a&s;to|ni&s;hment, I &s;aw one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els coming in with the &s;ails up. As &s;oon as the whites &s;aw it, they gave a great &s;hout, at which we were amazed; and the more &s;o as the ve&s;&s;el appeared larger by approaching nearer. At la&s;t &s;he came to an anchor in my &s;ight, and when the anchor was let go I and my countrymen who &s;aw it were lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment to ob&s;erve the ve&s;&s;el &s;top; and were now convinced it was
<PB N="78" REF="101">
done by magic. Soon after this the other &s;hip got her boats out, and they came on board of us, and the people of both &s;hips &s;eemed very glad to &s;ee each other. Several of the &s;trangers al&s;o &s;hook hands with us black people, and made motions with their hands, &s;ignifying I &s;uppo&s;e, we were to go to their country; but we did not under&s;tand them. At la&s;t, when the &s;hip we were in, had got in all her cargo, they made ready with many fearful noi&s;es, and we were all put under deck, &s;o that we could not &s;ee how they managed the ve&s;&s;el. But this di&s;appointment was the lea&s;t of my &s;orrow. The &s;tench of the hold while we were on the coa&s;t was &s;o in|tolerably loath&s;ome, that it was dan|gerous to remain there for any time, and &s;ome of us had been permitted to &s;tay on the deck for the fre&s;h air; but now that the whole &s;hip's cargo were
<PB N="79" REF="102">
confined together, it became ab&s;olutely pe&s;tilential. The clo&s;ene&s;s of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the &s;hip, which was &s;o crowded that each had &s;carcely room to turn him&s;elf, almo&s;t &s;uffocated us. This produced copious per&s;pirations, &s;o that the air &s;oon became unfit for re&s;piration, from a variety of loath|&s;ome &s;mells, and brought on a &s;ickne&s;s among the &s;laves, of which many died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their pur|cha&s;ers. This wretched &s;ituation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become in&s;upportable; and the filth of the nece&s;&s;ary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almo&s;t &s;uffocated. The &s;hrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a &s;cene of horror almo&s;t inconceivable. Happily perhaps
<PB N="80" REF="103">
for my&s;elf I was &s;oon reduced &s;o low here that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep me almo&s;t always on-deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In this &s;ituation I expected every hour to &s;hare the fate of my companions, &s;ome of whom were al|mo&s;t daily brought upon deck at the point of death, which I began to hope would &s;oon put an end to my mi&s;eries. Often did I think many of the inhabi|tants of the deep much more happy than my&s;elf, I envied them the freedom they enjoyed, and as often wi&s;hed I could change my condition for theirs. Every circum&s;tance I met with &s;erved only to render my &s;tate more painful, and heighten my apprehen&s;ions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the whites. One day they had taken a number of fi&s;hes; and when they had killed and &s;atisfied them&s;elves with as many as
<PB N="81" REF="104">
they thought fit, to our a&s;toni&s;hment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them to us to eat, as we expected, they to&s;&s;ed the remaining fi&s;h into the &s;ea again, although we begged and prayed for &s;ome as well as we could, but in vain; and &s;ome of my countrymen, being pre&s;&s;ed by hun|ger, took an opportunity, when they thought no one &s;aw them, of trying to get a little privately; but they were di&s;|covered, and the attempt procured them &s;ome very &s;evere floggings. One day, when we had a &s;mooth &s;ea and mode|rate wind, two of my wearied country|men who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring death to &s;uch a life of mi&s;ery, &s;omehow made through the nettings and jumped into the &s;ea: immediately another quite de|jected fellow, who on account of his illne&s;s, was &s;uffered to be out of irons,

al&s;o followed their example; and I be|lieve many more would very &s;oon have done the &s;ame if they had not been pre|vented by the &s;hip's crew, who were in&s;tantly alarmed. Tho&s;e of us that were the mo&s;t active were in a moment put down under the deck, and there was &s;uch a noi&s;e and confu&s;ion among&s;t the people of the &s;hip as I never heard before, to &s;top her, and get the boat out to go after the &s;laves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but they got the other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully, for thus at|tempting to prefer death to &s;lavery. In this manner we continued to under|go more hard&s;hips than I can now relate, hard&s;hips which are in&s;eparable from this accur&s;ed trade. Many a time we were near &s;uffocation from the want of fre&s;h air, which we were often without for whole days together. This,
<PB N="83" REF="106">
and the &s;tench of the nece&s;&s;ary tubs, carried off many. During our pa&s;&s;age I fir&s;t &s;aw flying fi&s;hes, which &s;urpri&s;ed me very much: they u&s;ed frequently to fly acro&s;s the &s;hip, and many of them fell on the deck. I al&s;o now fir&s;t &s;aw the u&s;e of the quadrant; I had often with a&s;toni&s;hment &s;een the mari|ners make ob&s;ervations with it, and I could not think what it meant. They at la&s;t took notice of my &s;urpri&s;e: and one of them, willing to increa&s;e it, as well as to gratify my curio&s;ity, made me one day look through it. The clouds appeared to me to be land, which di&s;|appeared as they pa&s;&s;ed along. This heightened my wonder; and I was now more per&s;uaded than ever that I was in another world, and that every thing about me was magic. At la&s;t we came in &s;ight of the i&s;land of Barbadoes, at which the whites on board gave a great
<PB N="84" REF="107">
&s;hout, and made many &s;igns of joy to us. We did not know what to think of this; but as the ve&s;&s;el drew nearer we plainly &s;aw the harbour, and other &s;hips of different kinds and &s;izes; and we &s;oon anchored among&s;t them off Bridge Town. Many merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the evening. They put us in &s;eparate parcels, and examined us attentively. They al&s;o made us jump, and pointed to the land, &s;ignifying we were to go there. We thought by this we &s;hould be eaten by the&s;e ugly men, as they ap|peared to us; and, when &s;oon after we were all put down under the deck again, there was much dread and trem|bling among us, and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, in&s;omuch that at la&s;t the white people got &s;ome old &s;laves from the land to pacify us. They
<PB N="85" REF="108">
told us we were not to be eaten, but to work, and were &s;oon to go on land, where we &s;hould &s;ee many of our country people. This report ea&s;ed us much; and &s;ure enough, &s;oon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all languages. We were conducted immediately to the mer|chant's yard, where we were all pent up together like &s;o many &s;heep in a fold, without regard to &s;ex or age. As every object was new to me every thing I &s;aw filled me with &s;urpri&s;e. What &s;truck me fir&s;t was that the hou&s;es were built with bricks and &s;tories, and in every other re&s;pect different from tho&s;e I had &s;een in Africa: but I was &s;till more a&s;|toni&s;hed on &s;eeing people on hor&s;eback. I did not know what this could mean; and indeed I thought the&s;e people were full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this a&s;toni&s;hment one of my
<PB N="86" REF="109">
fellow pri&s;oners &s;poke to a countryman of his about the hor&s;es, who &s;aid they were the &s;ame kind they had in their country. I under&s;tood them, though they were from a di&s;tant part of Africa, and I thought it odd I had not &s;een any hor&s;es there; but afterwards, when I came to conver&s;e with different Afri|cans, I found they had many hor&s;es among&s;t them, and much larger than tho&s;e I then &s;aw. We were not many days in the merchant's cu&s;tody before we were &s;old after their u&s;ual manner, which is this:&mdash;On a &s;ignal given, (as the beat of a drum) the buyers ru&s;h at once into the yard where the &s;laves are confined, and make choice of that parcel they like be&s;t. The noi&s;e and clamour with which this is attended, and the eagerne&s;s vi&s;ible in the coun|tenances of the buyers, &s;erve not a little to increa&s;e the apprehen&s;ion of the
<PB N="87" REF="110">
terrified Africans, who may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;ider them as the mini|&s;ters of that de&s;truction to which they think them&s;elves devoted. In this manner, without &s;cruple, are relations and friends &s;eparated, mo&s;t of them never to &s;ee each other again. I re|member in the ve&s;&s;el in which I was brought over, in the men's apartment, there were &s;everal brothers, who, in the &s;ale, were &s;old in different lots; and it was very moving on this occa&s;ion to &s;ee and hear their cries at parting. O, ye nominal Chri&s;tians! might not an African a&s;k you, learned you this from your God, who &s;ays unto you, Do unto all men as you would men &s;hould do unto you? Is it not enough that we are torn from our country and friends, to toil for your luxury and lu&s;t of gain? Mu&s;t every tender feeling be likewi&s;e &s;acrificed to your avarice?
<PB N="88" REF="111">
Are the deare&s;t friends and relations, now rendered more dear by their &s;epa|ration from their kindred, &s;till to be parted from each other, and thus pre|vented from cheering the gloom of &s;lavery with the &s;mall com&s;ort of being together and mingling their &s;ufferings and &s;orrows? Why are parents to lo&s;e their children, brothers their &s;i&s;ters, or hu&s;bands their wives? Surely this is a new refinement in cruelty, which, while it has no advantage to atone for it, thus aggravates di&s;tre&s;s, and adds fre&s;h horrors even to the wretchedne&s;s of &s;lavery.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I NOW totally lo&s;t the &s;mall remains of comfort I had enjoyed in con|ver&s;ing with my countrymen; the wo|men too, who u&s;ed to wa&s;h and take care of me, were all gone different
<PB N="90" REF="113">
ways, and I never &s;aw one of them afterwards.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed in this i&s;land for a few days; I believe it could not be above a fort|night; when I and &s;ome few more &s;laves, that were not &s;aleable among&s;t the re&s;t, from very much fretting, were &s;hipped off in a &s;loop for North America. On the pa&s;&s;age we were better treated than when we were com|ing from Africa, and we had plenty of rice and fat pork. We were landed up a river a good way from the &s;ea, about Virginia county, where we &s;aw few or none of our native Africans, and not one &s;oul who could talk to me. I was a few weeks weeding gra&s;s, and gathering &s;tones in a plantation; and at la&s;t all my companions were di&s;tri|buted different ways, and only my&s;elf was left. I was now exceedingly mi|&s;erable, and thought my&s;elf wor&s;e off
<PB N="91" REF="114">
than any of the re&s;t of my companions; for they could talk to each other, but I had no per&s;on to &s;peak to that I could under&s;tand. In this &s;tate I was con&s;tantly grieving and pining, and wi&s;hing for death rather than any thing el&s;e. While I was in this plantation the gentleman, to whom I &s;uppo&s;e the e&s;tate belonged, being unwell, I was one day &s;ent for to his dwelling hou&s;e to fan him; when I came into the room where he was I was very much affrighted at &s;ome things I &s;aw, and the more &s;o as I had &s;een a black woman &s;lave as I came through the hou&s;e, who was cooking the dinner, and the poor crea|ture was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines; &s;he had one particularly on her head, which locked her mouth &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak; and could not eat nor drink. I was much a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;hocked at
<PB N="92" REF="115">
this contrivance, which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle. Soon after I had a fan put into my hand, to fan the gentleman while he &s;lept; and &s;o I did indeed with great fear. While he was fa&s;t a&s;leep I in|dulged my&s;elf a great deal in looking about the room, which to me appeared very fine and curious. The fir&s;t object that engaged my attention was a watch which hung on the chimney, and was going. I was quite &s;urpri&s;ed at the noi&s;e it made, and was afraid it would tell the gentleman any thing I might do ami&s;s: and when I immediately after ob&s;erved a picture hanging in the room, which appeared con&s;tantly to look at me, I was &s;till more affrighted, having never &s;een &s;uch things as the&s;e before. At one time I thought it was &s;omething relative to magic; and not &s;eeing it move I thought it might be &s;ome way
<PB N="93" REF="116">
the whites had to keep their great men when they died, and offer them liba|tions as we u&s;ed to do to our friendly &s;pirits. In this &s;tate of anxiety I re|mained till my ma&s;ter awoke, when I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed out of the room, to my no &s;mall &s;atisfaction and relief; for I thought that the&s;e people were all made up of wonders. In this place I was called Jacob; but on board the African &s;now I was called Michael. I had been &s;ome time in this mi&s;erable, forlorn, and much dejected &s;tate, without having any one to talk to, which made my life a burden, when the kind and unknown hand of the Creator (who in very deed leads the blind in a way they know not) now began to appear, to my comfort; for one day the captain of a merchant &s;hip, called the Indu&s;trious Bee, came on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. This gentleman, who&s;e name was Mi|chael
<PB N="94" REF="117">
Henry Pa&s;cal, was a lieutenant in the royal navy, but now commanded this trading &s;hip, which was &s;ome|where in the confines of the county many miles off. While he was at my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e it happened that he &s;aw me, and like me &s;o well that he made a purcha&s;e of me. I think I have often heard him &s;ay he gave thirty or forty pounds &s;terling for me; but I do not now remember which. However, he meant me for a pre&s;ent to &s;ome of his friends in England: and I was &s;ent accordingly from the hou&s;e of my then ma&s;ter, (one Mr. Campbell) to the place where the &s;hip lay; I was con|ducted on hor&s;eback by an elderly black man, (a mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me). When I arrived I was carried on board a fine large &s;hip, loaded with tobacco, &amp;c. and ju&s;t ready to &s;ail for England.
<PB N="95" REF="118">
I now thought my condition much mended; I had &s;ails to lie on, and plenty of good victuals to eat; and every body on board u&s;ed me very kindly, quite contrary to what I had &s;een of any white people before; I therefore began to think that they were not all of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. A few days after I was on board we &s;ailed for England. I was &s;till at a lo&s;s to conjecture my de&s;tiny. By this time, however, I could &s;matter a little im|perfect Engli&s;h; and I wanted to know as well as I could where we were going. Some of the people of the &s;hip u&s;ed to tell me they were go|ing to carry me back to my own coun|try, and this made me very happy. I was qui e rejoiced at the idea of going back; and thought if I &s;hould get home what wonders I &s;hould have to tell. But I was re&s;erved for another
<PB N="96" REF="119">
fate, and was &s;oon undeceived, when we came within &s;ight of the Engli&s;h coa&s;t. While I was on board this &s;hip, my captain and ma&s;ter named me <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a.</HI> I at that time began to under&s;tand him a little, and refu&s;ed to be called &s;o, and told him as well as I could that I would be called Jacob; but he &s;aid I &s;hould not, and &s;till called me Gu&s;tavus: and when I re|&s;u&s;ed to an&s;wer to my new name, which at fir&s;t I did, it gained me many a cuff; &s;o at length I &s;ubmitted, and by which I have been known ever &s;ince. The &s;hip had a very long pa&s;|&s;age; and on that account we had very &s;hort allowance of provi&s;ions. Towards the la&s;t we had only one pound and a half of bread per week, and about the &s;ame quantity of meat, and one quart of water a-day. We &s;poke with only one ve&s;&s;el the whole time we were
<PB N="97" REF="120">
at &s;ea, and but once we caught a few fi&s;hes. In our extremities the captain and people told me in je&s;t they would kill and eat me; but I thought them in earne&s;t, and was depre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure, expecting every moment to be my la&s;t. While I was in this &s;itu|ation one evening they caught, with a good deal of trouble, a large &s;hark, and got it on board. This glad|dened my poor heart exceedingly, as I thought it would &s;erve the people to eat in&s;tead of their eating me; but very &s;oon, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, they cut off a &s;mall part of the tail, and to&s;&s;ed the re&s;t over the &s;ide. This renewed my con&s;ternation; and I did not know what to think of the&s;e white people, though I very much feared they would kill and eat me. There was on board the &s;hip a young lad who had never been at &s;ea before, about
<PB N="98" REF="121">
four or five years older than my&s;elf; his name was Richard Baker. He was a native of America, had received an ex|cellent education, and was of a mo&s;t amiable temper. Soon after I went on board he &s;hewed me a great deal of partiality and attention, and in return I grew extremely fond of him. We at length became in&s;eparable; and, for the &s;pace of two years, he was of very great u&s;e to me, and was my con&s;tant companion and in&s;tructor. Although this dear youth had many &s;laves of his own, yet he and I have gone through many &s;ufferings together on &s;hipboard; and we have many nights lain in each other's bo&s;oms when we were in great di&s;tre&s;s. Thus &s;uch a friend&s;hip was cemented between us as we cheri&s;hed till his death, which to my very great &s;orrow, happened in the year 1759, when he was up the
<PB N="99" REF="122">
Archipelago, on board his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Pre&s;ton: an event which I have never cea&s;ed to regret, as I lo&s;t at once a kind interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at the age of fifteen, di&s;covered a mind &s;uperior to prejudice; and who was not a&s;hamed to notice, to a&s;&s;ociate with, and to be the friend and in&s;tructor of one who was ignorant, a &s;tranger, of a different complexion, and a &s;lave! My ma&s;ter had lodged in his mother's hou&s;e in America: he re&s;pected him very much, and made him always eat with him in the cabin. He u&s;ed often to tell him jocularly that he would kill and eat me. Sometimes he would &s;ay to me&mdash;the black people were not good to eat, and would a&s;k me if we did not eat people in my country. I &s;aid, No: then he &s;aid he would kill Dick (as he always called him) fir&s;t,
<PB N="100" REF="123">
and afterwards me. Though this hear|ing relieved my mind a little as to my&s;elf, I was alarmed for Dick, and whenever he was called I u&s;ed to be very much afraid he was to be killed; and I would peep and watch to &s;ee if they were going to kill him: nor was I free from this con&s;ternation till we made the land. One night we lo&s;t a man overboard; and the cries and noi&s;e were &s;o great and confu&s;ed, in &s;topping the &s;hip, that I, who did not know what was the matter, began, as u&s;ual, to be very much afraid, and to think they were going to make an of|fering with me, and perform &s;ome magic; which I &s;till believed they dealt in. As the waves were very high I thought the Ruler of the &s;eas was an|gry, and I expected to be offered up to appea&s;e him. This filled my mind with agony, and I could not any more
<PB N="101" REF="124">
that night clo&s;e my eyes again to re&s;t. However, when daylight appeared was a little ea&s;ed in my mind; but &s;till every time I was called I u&s;ed to think it was to be killed. Some time after this we &s;aw &s;ome very large fi&s;h, which I afterwards found were called grampu&s;&s;es. They looked to me ex|tremely terrible, and made their ap|pearance ju&s;t at du&s;k; and were &s;o near as to blow the water on the &s;hip's deck. I believed them to be the rulers of the &s;ea; and as the white people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they were angry with them: and, at la&s;t, what con|firmed my belief was, the wind ju&s;t then died away, and a calm en&s;ued, and in con&s;equence of it the &s;hip &s;topped going. I &s;uppo&s;ed that the fi&s;h had per|formed this, and I hid my&s;elf in the fore part of the &s;hip, through fear of be|ing
<PB N="102" REF="125">
offered up to appea&s;e them, every minute peeping and quaking: but my good friend Dick came &s;hortly towards me, and I took an opportunity to a&s;k him, as well as I could, what the&s;e fi&s;h were. Not being able to talk much Engli&s;h, I could but ju&s;t make him under&s;tand my que&s;tion; and not at all, when I a&s;ked him if any offer|ings were to be made to them: how|ever, he told me the&s;e fi&s;h would &s;wallow any body; which &s;ufficiently alarmed me. Here he was called away by the captain, who was leaning over the quarter-deck railing and looking at the fi&s;h; and mo&s;t of the people were bu&s;ied in getting a barrel of pitch to light, for them to play with. The captain now called me to him, having learned &s;ome of my apprehen&s;ions from Dick; and having diverted him&s;elf and others for &s;ome time with my fears
<PB N="103" REF="126">
which appeared ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me. The barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the &s;ide into the water: by this time it was ju&s;t dark, and the fi&s;h went after it; and, to my great joy, I &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P>However, all my alarms began to &s;ub&s;ide when we got &s;ight of land; and at la&s;t the &s;hip arrived at Falmouth, af|ter a pa&s;&s;age of thirteen weeks. Every heart on board &s;eemed gladdened on our reaching the &s;hore, and none more than mine. The captain immediately went on &s;hore, and &s;ent on board &s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ions, which we wanted very much: we made good u&s;e of them, and our &s;amine was &s;oon turned into fea&s;t|ing, almo&s;t without ending. It was about the beginning of the &s;pring 1757, when I arrived in England, and I was near twelve years of age at that
<PB N="104" REF="127">
time. I was very much &s;truck with the buildings and the pavement of the &s;treets in Falmouth; and, indeed, every object I &s;aw filled me with new &s;ur|pri&s;e. One morning, when I got upon deck, I &s;aw it covered all over with the &s;now that fell over-night: as I had never &s;een any thing of the kind before, I thought it was &s;alt; &s;o I immediately ran down to the mate and de&s;ired him, as well as I could, to come and &s;ee how &s;omebody in the night had thrown &s;alt all over the deck. He, knowing what it was, de&s;ired me to bring &s;ome of it down to him: accordingly I took up a handful of it, which I found very cold indeed; and when I brought it to him he de&s;ired me to ta&s;te it. I did &s;o, and I was &s;urpri&s;ed beyond mea|&s;ure. I then a&s;ked him what it was; he told me it was &s;now: but I could not in anywi&s;e under&s;tand him. He
<PB N="105" REF="128">
a&s;ked me if we had no &s;uch thing in my country; and I told him, No. I then a&s;ked him the u&s;e of it, and who made it; he told me a great man in the heavens, called God: but here again I was to all intents and purpo&s;es at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand him; and the more &s;o, when a little after I &s;aw the air filled with it, in a heavy &s;hower, which fell down on the &s;ame day. After this I went to church; and having never been at &s;uch a place before, I was again amazed at &s;eeing and hearing the &s;ervice. I a&s;ked all I could about it; and they gave me to under&s;tand it was wor&s;hipping God, who made us and all things. I was &s;till at a great lo&s;s, and &s;oon got into an endle&s;s field of inquiries, as well as I was able to &s;peak and a&s;k about things. However, my little friend Dick u&s;ed to
<PB N="106" REF="129">
be my be&s;t interpreter; for I could make free with him, and he always in|&s;tructed me with plea&s;ure: and from what I could under&s;tand by him of this God, and in &s;eeing the&s;e white people did not &s;ell one another as we did, I was much plea&s;ed; and in this I thought they were much happier than we Afri|cans. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the wi&s;dom of the white people in all things I &s;aw; but was amazed at their not &s;acrificing, or making any offerings, and eating with unwa&s;hed hands, and touching the dead. I likewi&s;e could not help re|marking the particular &s;lenderne&s;s of their women, which I did not at fir&s;t like; and I thought they were not &s;o mode&s;t and &s;hamefaced as the African women.</P>
<P>I had often &s;een my ma&s;ter and Dick employed in reading; and I had a great curio&s;ity to talk to the books, as
<PB N="107" REF="130">
I thought they did; and &s;o to learn how all things had a beginning: for that purpo&s;e I have often taken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it, when alone, in hopes it would an&s;wer me; and I have been very much concerned when I found it remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter lodged at the hou&s;e of a gentleman in Falmouth, who had a fine little daughter about &s;ix or &s;even years of age, and &s;he grew prodigiou&s;ly fond of me; in&s;omuch that we u&s;ed to eat together, and had &s;ervants to wait on us. I was &s;o much care&s;&s;ed by this family that it often reminded me of the treatment I had received from my little noble African ma&s;ter. After I had been here a few days, I was &s;ent on board of the &s;hip; but the child cried &s;o much a&s;ter me that nothing could pacify her till I was &s;ent for again.
<PB N="108" REF="131">
It is ludicrous enough, that I began to fear I &s;hould be betrothed to this young lady; and when my ma&s;ter a&s;ked me if I would &s;tay there with her behind him, as he was going away with the &s;hip, which had taken in the tobacco again, I cried immediately, and &s;aid I would not leave him. At la&s;t, by &s;tealth, one night I was &s;ent on board the &s;hip again; and in a little time we &s;ailed for Guern&s;ey, where &s;he was in part owned by a merchant, one Nicholas Doberry. As I was now among&s;t a people who had not their faces &s;carred, like &s;ome of the African nations where I had been, I was very glad I did not let them ornament me in that manner when I was with them. When we arrived at Guern&s;ey, my ma&s;ter placed me to board and lodge with one of his mates, who had a wife and family there; and &s;ome months after|wards
<PB N="109" REF="132">
he went to England, and left me in care of this mate, together with my friend Dick: This mate had a little daughter, aged about five or &s;ix years, with whom I u&s;ed to be much de|lighted. I had often ob&s;erved that when her mother wa&s;hed her face it looked very ro&s;y; but when &s;he wa&s;hed mine it did not look &s;o: I therefore tried oftentimes my&s;elf if I could not by wa&s;hing make my face of the &s;ame co|lour as my little play-mate (Mary), but it was all in vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our com|plexions. This woman behaved to me with great kindne&s;s and attention; and taught me every thing in the &s;ame manner as &s;he did her own child, and indeed in every re&s;pect treated me as &s;uch. I remained here till the &s;um|mer of the year 1757; when my ma&s;ter, being appointed fir&s;t lieu|tenant

of his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Roe|buck, &s;ent for Dick and me, and his old mate: on this we all left Guern&s;ey, and &s;et out for England in a &s;loop bound for London. As we were coming up towards the Nore, where the Roebuck lay, a man of war's boat came along&s;ide to pre&s;s our peo|ple; on which each man ran to hide him&s;elf. I was very much frightened at this, though I did not know what it meant, or what to think or do. How|ever I went and hid my&s;elf al&s;o under a hencoop. Immediately afterwards the pre&s;s-gang came on board with their &s;words drawn, and &s;earched all about, pulled the people out by force, and put them into the boat. At la&s;t I was found out al&s;o; the man that found me held me up by the heels while they all made their &s;port of me, I roaring and crying out all the time mo&s;t lu&s;tily; but at
<PB N="111" REF="134">
la&s;t the mate, who was my conductor, &s;eeing this, came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and did all he could to pacify me; but all to very little purpo&s;e, till I had &s;een the boat go off. Soon afterwards we came to the Nore, where the Roebuck lay; and, to our great joy, my ma&s;ter came on board to us, and brought us to the &s;hip. When I went on board this large &s;hip, I was amazed indeed to &s;ee the quantity of men and the guns. However my &s;urpri&s;e began to dimini&s;h as my knowledge increa&s;ed; and I cea&s;ed to feel tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions and alarms which had taken &s;uch &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me when I fir&s;t came among the Europeans, and for &s;ome time after. I began now to pa&s;s to an op|po&s;ite extreme; I was &s;o far from being afraid of any thing new which I &s;aw, that, after I had been &s;ome time in this &s;hip, I even began to long for an engagement.
<PB N="112" REF="135">
My griefs too, which in young minds are not perpetual, were now wearing away; and I &s;oon enjoyed my&s;elf pretty well, and felt tolerably ea&s;y in my pre|&s;ent &s;ituation. There was a number of boys on board, which &s;till made it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part of our time was &s;pent in play. I remained in this &s;hip a con&s;iderable time, during which we made &s;everal crui&s;es, and vi&s;ited a variety of places: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction from it, who&s;e names I do not now remem|ber. On the pa&s;&s;age, one day, for the diver&s;ion of tho&s;e gentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter deck, and were paired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the gentlemen gave the combatants from five to nine &s;hillings each. This was
<PB N="113" REF="136">
the fir&s;t time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew what it was to have a bloody no&s;e before. This made me fight mo&s;t de&s;perately; I &s;uppo&s;e con&s;iderably more than an hour: and at la&s;t, both of us being weary, we were parted. I had a great deal of this kind of &s;port afterwards, in which the captain and the &s;hip's company u&s;ed very much to encourage me. Some|time afterwards the &s;hip went to Leith in Scotland, and from thence to the Ork|neys, where I was &s;urpri&s;ed in &s;eeing &s;carcely any night: and from thence we &s;ailed with a great fleet, full of &s;oldiers, for England. All this time we had never come to an engagement, though we were frequently crui&s;ing off the coa&s;t of France: during which we cha&s;ed many ve&s;&s;els, and took in all &s;eventeen prizes. I had been learning many of the manoeuvres of the &s;hip
<PB N="114" REF="137">
during our crui&s;e; and I was &s;everal times made to fire the guns. One even|ing, off Havre de Grace, ju&s;t as it was growing dark, we were &s;tanding off &s;hore, and met with a fine large French-built frigate. We got all things immediately ready for fighting; and I now expected I &s;hould be gratified in &s;eeing an engagement, which I had &s;o long wi&s;hed for in vain. But the very moment the word of command was given to fire, we heard tho&s;e on board the other &s;hip cry <Q REND="inline">'Haul down the jib;'</Q> and in that in&s;tant &s;he hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours. There was in&s;tantly with us an amazing cry of&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Ava&s;t!'</Q> or &s;top firing; and I think one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no mi&s;|chief. We had hailed them &s;everal times; but they not hearing, we re|ceived no an&s;wer, which was the cau&s;e of our firing. The boat was then &s;ent
<PB N="115" REF="138">
on board of her, and &s;he proved to be the Ambu&s;cade man of war, to my no|&s;mall di&s;appointment. We returned to Port&s;mouth, without having been in any action, ju&s;t at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I &s;aw &s;everal times dur|ing it): and my ma&s;ter having left the &s;hip, and gone to London for promo|tion, Dick and I were put on board the Savage &s;loop of war, and we went in her to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing off the St. George man of war, that had ran a&s;hore &s;omewhere on the coa&s;t. After &s;taying a few weeks on board the Savage, Dick and I were &s;ent on &s;hore at Deal, where we remained &s;ome &s;hort time, till my ma&s;ter &s;ent for us to London, the place I had long de&s;ired exceedingly to &s;ee. We therefore both with great plea&s;ure got into a waggon, and came to Lon|don, where we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my ma&s;ter. This
<PB N="116" REF="139">
gentleman had two &s;i&s;ters, very ami|able ladies, who took much notice and great care of me. Though I had de|&s;ired &s;o much to &s;ee London, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my curio&s;ity; for I had at this time the chilblains to &s;uch a de|gree that I could not &s;tand for &s;everal months, and I was obliged to be &s;ent to St. George's Ho&s;pital. There I grew &s;o ill, that the doctors wanted to cut my left leg off at different times, apprehending a mortification; but I always &s;aid I would rather die than &s;uf|fer it; and happily (I thank God) I recovered without the operation. After being there &s;everal weeks, and ju&s;t as I had recovered, the &s;mall pox broke out on me, &s;o that I was again confined; and I thought my&s;elf now particularly unfortunate. However I &s;oon reco|vered again; and by this time my
<PB N="117" REF="140">
ma&s;ter having been promoted to be fir&s;t lieutenant of the Pre&s;ton man of war of fifty guns, then new at Deptford, Dick and I were &s;ent on board her, and &s;oon after we went to Holland to bring over the late Duke of &mdash; to England.&mdash;While I was in this &s;hip an incident happened, which, though trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I could not help taking particular notice of it, and con&s;idering it then as a judgment of God. One morning a young man was looking up to the fore-top, and in a wicked tone, common on &s;hipboard, d&mdash;d his eyes about &s;omething. Ju&s;t at the moment &s;ome &s;mall particles of dirt fell into his left eye, and by the evening it was very much inflamed. The next day it grew wor&s;e; and within &s;ix or &s;even days he lo&s;t it. From this &s;hip, my ma&s;ter was appointed a lieutenant on board the Royal George.
<PB N="118" REF="141">
When he was going he wi&s;hed me to &s;tay on board the Pre&s;ton, to learn the French horn; but the &s;hip being or|dered for Turkey I could not think of leaving my ma&s;ter, to whom I was very warmly attached; and I told him if he left me behind it would break my heart. This prevailed on him to take me with him; but he left Dick on board the Pre&s;ton, whom I embraced at parting for the la&s;t time. The Royal George was the large&s;t &s;hip I had ever &s;een; &s;o that when I came on board of her I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the number of people, men, women, and children, of every denomination; and the largene&s;s of the guns, many of them al&s;o of bra&s;s, which I had never &s;een before. Here were al&s;o &s;hops or &s;talls of every kind of goods, and people crying their dif|ferent commodities about the &s;hip as in a town. To me it appeared a little
<PB N="119" REF="142">
world, into which I was again ca&s;t with out a friend, for I had no longer my dear companion Dick. We did not &s;tay long here. My ma&s;ter was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to be &s;ixth lieutenant of the Namur, which was then at Spit|head, fitting up for Vice-admiral Bo&s;ca|wen, who was going with a large fleet on an expedition again&s;t Loui&s;burgh. The crew of the Royal George were turned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoi&s;ted on board, the blue at the maintop gallant ma&s;t head. There was a very great fleet of men of war of every de&s;crip|tion a&s;&s;embled together for this expe|dition, and I was in hopes &s;oon to have an opportunity of being gratified with a &s;ea-fight. All things being now in readine&s;s, this mighty fleet (for there was al&s;o Admiral Corni&s;h's fleet in com|pany,
<PB N="120" REF="143">
de&s;tined for the Ea&s;t Indies) at la&s;t weighed anchor, and failed. The two fleets continued in company for &s;everal days, and then parted; Admiral Corni&s;h, in the Lenox, having fir&s;t &s;a|luted our admiral in the Namur, which he returned. We then &s;teered for America; but, by contrary winds, we were driven to Teneriffe, where I was &s;truck with its noted peak. Its prodi|gious height, and its form, re&s;embling a &s;ugar loaf, filled me with wonder. We remained in &s;ight of this i&s;land &s;ome days, and then proceeded for America, which we &s;oon made, and got into a very commodious harbour called St. George, in Halifax, where we had fi&s;h in great plenty, and all other fre&s;h provi&s;ions. We were here joined by different men of war and tran&s;port &s;hips with &s;oldiers; after which, our fleet being increa&s;ed to a
<PB N="121" REF="144">
prodigious number of &s;hips of all kinds, we &s;ailed for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. We had the good and gallant General Wolfe on board our &s;hip, who&s;e affability made him highly e&s;teemed and beloved by all the men. He often honoured me, as well as other boys, with marks of his notice; and &s;aved me once a flogging for fighting with a young gentleman. We arrived at Cape Breton in the &s;ummer of 1758: and here the &s;oldiers were to be landed, in order to make an attack upon Loui&s;|bourgh. My ma&s;ter had &s;ome part in &s;uperintending the landing; and here I was in a &s;mall mea&s;ure gratified in &s;ee|ing an encounter between our men and the enemy. The French were po&s;ted on the &s;hore to receive us, and di&s;puted our landing for a long time: but at la&s;t they were driven from their trenches, and a complete landing was effected. Our
<PB N="122" REF="145">
troops pur&s;ued them as far as the town of Loui&s;bourgh. In this action many were killed on both &s;ides. One thing remarkable I &s;aw this day&punc;&mdash;A lieute|nant of the Prince&s;s Amelia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ho, as well as my ma&s;ter, &s;uperintended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> landing, was giving the word of command, and while his mouth was oper a mu&s;quet ball went through it, and pa&s;&s;ed out at his check. I had that day in my hand the &s;calp of an indian king, who was killed in the engagement: the &s;calp had been taken off by an Highlander. I &s;aw this king's ornaments too, which were very curious, and made of fea|thers.</P>
<P>Our land forces laid &s;iege to the town of Loui&s;bourgh, while the French men of war were blocked up in the harbour by the fleet, the batteries at the &s;ame time playing upon them from the land. This they did with &s;uch effect, that one
<PB N="123" REF="146">
day I &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;hips &s;et on fire by the &s;hells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them were quite burnt. At another time, about fifty boats belonging to the Engli&s;h men of war, commaded by Captain George Belfour of the Aetna fire &s;hip, and Mr. Laforey another junior captain, attack|ed and boarded the only two remaining French men of war in the harbour. They al&s;o &s;et fire to a &s;eventy-gun &s;hip, but a &s;ixty-four, called the Bienfai&s;ant, they brought off. During my &s;tay here I had often an opportunity of being near cap|tain Belfour, who was plea&s;ed to notice me, and liked me &s;o much that he often a&s;ked my ma&s;ter to let him have me, but he would not part with me; and no con&s;ideration could have induced me to leave him. At la&s;t Loui&s;bourgh was taken, and the Eng|li&s;h men of war came into the harbour
<PB N="124" REF="147">
before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging my|&s;elf, and I went often on &s;hore. When the &s;hips were in the harbour we had the mo&s;t beautiful proce&s;&s;ion on the water I ever &s;aw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dre&s;&s;ed, and in their barges, well ornamented with pendants, came along&s;ide of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on &s;hore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of &s;eniority, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as I &s;uppo&s;e, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other per&s;ons of note, came on board our &s;hip to dine. On this occa&s;ion our &s;hips were dre&s;&s;ed with colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-ma&s;t head to the deck; and this, with the firing of guns, formed a mo&s;t grand and magnificent &s;pectacle.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="148">
As &s;oon as every thing here was &s;ettled, Admiral Bo&s;cawen &s;ailed with part of the fleet for England, leaving &s;ome &s;hips behind with Rear admirals Sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was now winter; and one evening, during our pa&s;&s;age home, about du&s;k, when we were in the channel, or near &s;ound|ings, and were beginning to look for land, we de&s;cried &s;even &s;ail of large men of war, which &s;tood off &s;hore. Several people on board of our &s;hip &s;aid, as the two fleets were (in forty minutes from the fir&s;t &s;ight) within hail of each other, that they were Engli&s;h men of war; and &s;ome of our people even began to name &s;ome of the &s;hips. By this time both fleets began to min|gle, and our admiral ordered his flag to be hoi&s;ted. At that in&s;tant the other fleet, which were French, hoi&s;ted their en&s;igns, and gave us a broad&s;ide as they
<PB N="126" REF="149">
pa&s;&s;ed by. Nothing could create greater &s;urpri&s;e and confu&s;ion among us than this: the wind was high, the &s;ea rough, and we had our lower and middle deck guns hou&s;ed in, &s;o that not a &s;ingle gun on board was ready te be fired at any of the French &s;hips. However, the Royal William and the Somer&s;et, being our &s;ternmo&s;t &s;hips, became a little pre|pared, and each gave the French &s;hips a broad&s;ide as they pa&s;&s;ed by. I after|wards heard this was a French &s;qua|dron, commanded by Mon&s;. Conflans; and certainly had the Frenchmen known our condition, and had a mind to fight us, they might have done us great mi&s;chief. But we were not long before we were prepared for an engagement. Immediately many things were to&s;&s;ed overboard; the &s;hips were made ready for fighting as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and about ten at night we had bent a new
<PB N="127" REF="150">
main &s;ail, the old one being &s;plit. Be|ing now in readine&s;s for fighting, we wore &s;hip, and &s;tood after the French fleet, who were one or two &s;hips in number more than we. However we gave them cha&s;e, and continued pur&s;u|ing them all night; and at day-light we &s;aw &s;ix of them, all large &s;hips of the line, and an Engli&s;h Ea&s;t Indiaman, a prize they had taken. We cha&s;ed them all day till between three and four o'clock in the evening, when we came up with, and pa&s;&s;ed within a mu&s;quet &s;hot of one &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip, and the Indiaman al&s;o, who now hoi&s;ted her colours, but immediately hauled them down again. On this we made a &s;ig|nal for the other &s;hips to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; and, &s;uppo&s;ing the man of war would likewi&s;e &s;trike, we cheered, but &s;he did not; though if we had fired into her, from being &s;o near, we mu&s;t have taken her. To my utter &s;urpri&s;e,
<PB N="128" REF="151">
the Somer&s;et, who was the next &s;hip a-&s;tern of the Namur, made way like|wi&s;e; and, thinking they were &s;ure of this French &s;hip, they cheered in the &s;ame manner, but &s;till continued to follow us. The French Commodore was about a gun-&s;hot ahead of all, run|ning from us with all &s;peed; and about four o'clock he carried his foretop|ma&s;t overboard. This cau&s;ed another loud cheer with us; and a little after the topma&s;t came clo&s;e by us; but, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, in&s;tead of coming up with her, we found &s;he went as fa&s;t as ever, if not fa&s;ter. The &s;ea grew now much &s;moother; and the wind lulling, the &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip we had pa&s;&s;ed came again by us in the very &s;ame direction, and &s;o near, that we heard her people talk as &s;he went by; yet not a &s;hot was fired on either &s;ide; and about five or &s;ix o'clock, ju&s;t as it grew dark, &s;he joined her
<PB N="129" REF="152">
commodore. We cha&s;ed all night; but the next day we were out of &s;ight, &s;o that we &s;aw no more of them; and we only had the old Indiaman (called Carnarvon I think) for our trouble. After this we &s;tood in for the channel, and &s;oon made the land; and, about the clo&s;e of the year 1758-9, we got &s;afe to St. Helen's. Here the Namur ran aground; and al&s;o another large &s;hip a&s;tern of us; but, by &s;tarting our water, and to&s;&s;ing many things overboard to lighten her, we got the &s;hips off without any damage. We &s;tayed for a &s;hort time at Spithead, and then went into Port&s;mouth harbour to refit: from whence the admiral went to London; and my ma&s;ter and I &s;oon followed, with a pre&s;s-gang, as we wanted &s;ome hands to complete our complement.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was now between two and three years &s;ince I fir&s;t came to England, a great part of which I had &s;pent at &s;ea; &s;o that I became inured to that &s;ervice, and began to con&s;ider my&s;elf as happily &s;ituated; for my ma&s;ter treated me al|ways extremely well; and my attach|ment and gratitude to him were very great. From the various &s;cenes I had
<PB N="132" REF="155">
beheld on &s;hip-board, I &s;oon grew a &s;tranger to terror of every kind, and was, in that re&s;pect at lea&s;t, almo&s;t an Engli&s;hman. I have often reflected with &s;urpri&s;e that I never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous dangers I have been in, that I was &s;illed with at the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Europeans, and at every act of theirs, even the mo&s;t trifling, when I fir&s;t came among them, and for &s;ome time afterwards. That fear, however, which was the effect of my ignorance, wore away as I began to know them. I could now &s;peak Engli&s;h tolerably well, and I perfectly under&s;tood every thing that was &s;aid. I not only felt my&s;elf quite ea&s;y with the&s;e new countrymen, but reli&s;hed their &s;ociety and manners. I no longer looked upon them as &s;pirits, but as men &s;uperior to us; and there|fore I had the &s;tronger de&s;ire to re|&s;emble
<PB N="133" REF="156">
them; to imbibe their &s;pirit, and imitate their manners; I therefore embraced every occa&s;ion of improve|ment; and every new thing that I ob|&s;erved I trea&s;ured up in my memory. I had long wi&s;hed to be able to read and write; and for this purpo&s;e I took every opportunity to gain in&s;truction, but had made as yet very little pro|gre&s;s. However, when I went to London with my ma&s;ter, I had &s;oon an opportunity of improving my&s;elf, which I gladly embraced. Shortly after my arrival, he &s;ent me to wait upon the Mi&s;s Guerins, who had treated me with much kindne&s;s when I was there before; and they &s;ent me to &s;chool.</P>
<P>While I was attending the&s;e ladies, their &s;ervants told me I could not go to Heaven, unle&s;s I was baptized. This made me very unea&s;y; for I had now &s;ome faint idea of a future &s;tate:
<PB N="134" REF="157">
accordingly I communicated my anxiety to the elde&s;t Mi&s;s Guerin, with whom I was become a favourite, and pre&s;&s;ed her to have me baptized; when to my great joy, &s;he told me I &s;hould. She had formerly a&s;ked my ma&s;ter to let me be baptized, but he had refu&s;ed; however &s;he now in&s;i&s;ted on it; and he being under &s;ome obligation to her brother complied with her reque&s;t; &s;o I was baptized in St. Margaret's church, We&s;tmin&s;ter, in February 1759, by my pre&s;ent name. The clergyman at the &s;ame time, gave me a book, called a Guide to the Indians, written by the Bi&s;hop of Sodor and Man. On this occa&s;ion, Mi&s;s Guerin did me the ho|nour to &s;tand as godmother, and after|wards gave me a treat. I u&s;ed to at|tend the&s;e ladies about the town, in which &s;ervice I was extremely happy; as I had thus many opportunities of
<PB N="135" REF="158">
&s;eeing London, which I de&s;ired of all things. I was &s;ometimes, however, with my ma&s;ter at his rendezvous-hou&s;e, which was at the foot of We&s;t|min&s;ter-bridge. Here I u&s;ed to enjoy my&s;elf in playing about the bridge &s;tairs, and often in the watermen's wherries, with other boys. On one of the&s;e occa&s;ions there was another boy with me in a wherry, and we went out into the current of the river: while we were there, two more &s;tout boys came to us in another wherry, and, abu&s;ing us for taking the boat, de&s;ired me to get into the other wherry-boat. Accord|ingly I went to get out of the wherry I was in; but ju&s;t as I had got one of my feet into the other boat, the boys &s;hoved it off, &s;o that I fell into the Thames; and, not being able to &s;wim, I &s;hould unavoidably have been drowned, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome
<PB N="136" REF="159">
watermen who providentially came to my relief.</P>
<P>The Namur being again got ready for &s;ea, my ma&s;ter, with his gang, was ordered on board; and, to my no &s;mall grief, I was obliged to leave my &s;chool|ma&s;ter, whom I liked very much, and always attended while I &s;tayed in Lon|don, to repair on board with my ma&s;ter. Nor did I leave my kind pa|trone&s;&s;es, the Mi&s;s Guerins, without unea&s;ine&s;s and regret. They often u&s;ed to teach me to read, and took great pains to in&s;truct me in the prin|ciples of religion and the knowledge of God. I therefore parted from tho&s;e amiable ladies with reluctance: after receiving from them many friendly cautions how to conduct my&s;elf, and &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>When I came to Spithead, I found we were de&s;tined for the Mediterra|nean,
<PB N="137" REF="160">
with a large fleet, which was now ready to put to &s;ea. We only waited for the arrival of the admiral, who &s;oon came on board; and about the begin|ning of the &s;pring 1759, having weigh|ed anchor, and got under way, &s;ailed for the Mediterranean; and in eleven days, from the Land's End, we got to Gibraltar. While we were here I u&s;ed to be often on &s;hore, and got various fruits in great plenty, and very cheap.</P>
<P>I had frequently told &s;everal people, in my excur&s;ions on &s;hore, the &s;tory of my being kidnapped with my &s;i&s;ter, and of our being &s;eparated, as I have related before; and I had as often expre&s;&s;ed my anxiety for her fate, and my &s;orrow at having never met her again. One day, when I was on &s;hore, and men|tioning the&s;e circum&s;tances to &s;ome per&s;ons, one of them told me he knew
<PB N="138" REF="161">
where my &s;i&s;ter was, and, if I would accompany him, he would bring me to her. Improbable as this &s;tory was, I believed it immediately, and agreed to go with him, while my heart leaped for joy; and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young woman, who was &s;o like my &s;i&s;ter, that at fir&s;t &s;ight, I really thought it was her: but I was quickly undeceived; and, on talking to her, I found her to be of another nation.</P>
<P>While we lay here the Pre&s;ton came in from the Levant. As &s;oon as &s;he arrived, my ma&s;ter told me I &s;hould now &s;ee my old companion, Dick, who was gone in her when &s;he &s;ailed for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at this news, and expected every minute to embrace him; and when the cap|tain came on board of our &s;hip, which he did immediately after, I ran to in|quire after my friend; but, with inex|pre&s;&s;ible
<PB N="139" REF="162">
&s;orrow, I learned from the boat's crew that the dear youth was dead! and that they had brought his che&s;t, and all his other things, to my ma&s;ter: the&s;e he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of my friend, whom I loved, and grieved for, as a brother.</P>
<P>While we were at Gibralter, I &s;aw a &s;oldier hanging by the heels, at one of the moles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had drowned him&s;elf in endeavouring to de&s;ert.</NOTE>: I thought this a &s;trange &s;ight, as I had &s;een a man hanged in London by his neck. At another time I &s;aw the ma&s;ter of a frigate towed to &s;hore on a grating, by &s;everal of the men of war's boats, and di&s;charged the fleet, which I under&s;tood was a mark of di&s;|grace for cowardice. On board the &s;ame &s;hip there was al&s;o a &s;ailor hung up at the yard-arm.</P>
<P>After lying at Gibralter for &s;ome
<PB N="140" REF="163">
time, we &s;ailed up the Mediterranean a con&s;iderable way above the Gulf of Eyons; where we were one night overtaken with a terrible gale of wind, much greater than any I had ever yet experienced. The &s;ea ran &s;o high that, though all the guns were well hou&s;ed, there was great rea&s;on to fear their getting loo&s;e, the &s;hip rolled &s;o much; and if they had it mu&s;t have proved our de&s;truction. After we had crui&s;ed here for a &s;hort time, we came to Bar|celona, a Spani&s;h &s;ea-port, remarkable for its &s;ilk manufactures. Here the &s;hips were all to be watered; and my ma&s;ter, who &s;poke different languages, and u&s;ed often to interpret for the ad|miral, &s;uperintended the watering of ours. For that purpo&s;e he and the officers of the other &s;hips, who were on the &s;ame &s;ervice, had tents pitched in the bay; and the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers were &s;tationed along the &s;hore, I &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="141" REF="164">
to &s;ee that no depredations were committed by our men.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed con&s;tantly to attend my ma&s;|ter; and I was charmed with this place. All the time we &s;tayed it was like a fair with the natives, who brought us fruits of all kinds, and &s;old them to us much cheaper than I got them in England. They u&s;ed al&s;o to bring wine down to us in hog and &s;heep &s;kins, which diverted me very much. The Spani&s;h officers here treated our officers with great politene&s;s and atten|tion; and &s;ome of them, in particular, u&s;ed to come often to my ma&s;ter's tent to vi&s;it him; where they would &s;ome|times divert them&s;elves by mounting me on the hor&s;es or mules, &s;o that I could not fall, and &s;etting them off at full gal|lop; my imperfect &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip all the while affording them no &s;mall entertainment. After the &s;hips were
<PB N="142" REF="165">
watered, we returned to our old &s;ta|tion of cruizing off Toulon, for the purpo&s;e of intercepting a fleet of French men of war that lay there. One Sun|day, in our crui&s;e, we came off a place where there were two &s;mall French fri|gates lying in &s;hore; and our admiral, thinking to take or de&s;troy them, &s;ent two &s;hips in after them&mdash;the Culloden and the Conqueror. They &s;oon came up to the Frenchmen; and I &s;aw a &s;mart fight here, both by &s;ea and land: for the frigates were covered by bat|teries, and they played upon our &s;hips mo&s;t furiou&s;ly, which they as furiou&s;ly returned, and for a long time a con|&s;tant firing was kept up on all &s;ides at an amazing rate. At la&s;t one frigate &s;unk; but the people e&s;caped, though not without much difficulty: and a little after &s;ome of the people left the other frigate al&s;o, which was a mere
<PB N="143" REF="166">
wreck. However, our &s;hips did not venture to bring her away, they were &s;o much annoyed from the batteries, which raked them both in going and coming: their topma&s;ts were &s;hot a|way, and they were otherwi&s;e &s;o much &s;hattered, that the admiral was obliged to &s;end in many boats to tow them back to the fleet. I afterwards &s;ailed with a man who fought in one of the French batteries during the engage|ment, and he told me our &s;hips had done con&s;iderable mi&s;chief that day on &s;hore and in the batteries.</P>
<P>After this we &s;ailed for Gibraltar, and arrived there about Augu&s;t 1759. Here we remained with all our &s;ails un|bent, while the fleet was watering and doing other nece&s;&s;ary things. While we were in this &s;ituation, one day the admiral, with mo&s;t of the principal of|ficers, and many people of all &s;tations,
<PB N="144" REF="167">
being on &s;hore, about &s;even o'clock in the evening we were alarmed by &s;ignals from the frigates &s;tationed for that purpo&s;e; and in an in&s;tant there was a general cry that the French fleet was out, and ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treights. The admiral immediately came on board with &s;ome other of|ficers; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the noi&s;e, hurry and confu&s;ion through|out the whole fleet, in bending their &s;ails and &s;lipping their cables; many people and &s;hips' boats were left on &s;hore in the bu&s;tle. We had two captains on board of our &s;hip who came away in the hurry and left their &s;hips to follow. We &s;hewed lights from the gun-wales to the main top ma&s;t-head; and all our lieutenants were employed among&s;t the fleet to tell the &s;hips not to wait for ther captains, but to put the &s;ails to the yards, &s;lip their cables
<PB N="145" REF="168">
and follow us; and in this confu&s;ion of making ready for fighting, we &s;et out for &s;ea in the dark after the French fleet. Here I could have exclaimed with Ajax,<Q><L>"Oh Jove! O father! if it be thy will</L>
<L>"That we mu&s;t peri&s;h, we thy will obey,</L>
<L>"But let us peri&s;h by the light of day."</L></Q> They had got the &s;tart of us &s;o far that we were not able to come up with them during the night; but at day-light we &s;aw &s;even &s;ail of the line of battle &s;ome miles ahead. We immediately cha&s;ed them till about four o'clock in the evening, when our &s;hips came up with them; and, though we were about fifteen large &s;hips, our gallant admiral only fought them with his own divi&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even; &s;o that we were ju&s;t &s;hip for &s;hip. We pa&s;&s;ed by the whole of the enemy's fleet in order to come at their com|mander,
<PB N="146" REF="169">
Mon&s;. La Clue, who was in the Ocean, an eighty-four gun &s;hip. as we pa&s;&s;ed they all fired on us; and at one time three of them fired together, continuing to do &s;o for &s;ome time. Notwith&s;tanding which our ad|miral would not &s;uffer a gun to be fired at any of them, to my a&s;toni&s;hment; but made us lie on our bellies on the deck till we came quite clo&s;e to the Ocean, who was ahead of them all; when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers into her at once.</P>
<P>The engagement now commenced with great fury on both &s;ides: the Ocean immediately returned our fire, and we continued engaged with each other for &s;ome time; during which I was fre|quently &s;tunned with the thundering of the great guns, who&s;e dreadful con|tents hurried many of my companions into awful eternity. At la&s;t the French
<PB N="147" REF="170">
line was entirely broken, and we obtain|ed the victory, which was immediately proclaimed with loud huzzas and ac|clamations. We took three prizes, La Mode&s;te, of &s;ixty-four guns, and Le Temeraire and Centaur, of &s;eventy-four guns each. The re&s;t of the French &s;hips took to flight with all the &s;ail they could crowd. Our &s;hip being very much damaged, and quite di&s;abled from pur|&s;uing the enemy, the admiral imme|diately quitted her, and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board the Newark, with which, and &s;ome other &s;hips, he went after the French. The Ocean, and another large French &s;hip, called the Redoubt|able, endeavouring to e&s;cape, ran a&s;hore at Cape Logas, on the coa&s;t of Portugal; and the French admiral and &s;ome of the crew got a&s;hore; but we, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to get the &s;hips
<PB N="148" REF="171">
off, &s;et fire to them both. About midnight I &s;aw the Ocean blow up, with a mo&s;t dreadful explo&s;ion. I never beheld a more awful &s;cene. In le&s;s than a minute, the midnight for a certain &s;pace &s;eemed turned into day by the blaze, which was attended with a noi&s;e louder and more terrible than thunder, that &s;eemed to rend every element around us.</P>
<P>My &s;tation during the engagement was on the middle-deck, where I was quartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermo&s;t gun; and here I was a witne&s;s of the dreadful fate of many of my companions, who, in the twinkling of an eye, were da&s;hed in pieces, and launched into eternity. Happily I e&s;caped unhurt, though the &s;hot and &s;plinters flew thick about me during the whole fight. Towards the latter part of it my ma&s;ter was wound|ed,
<PB N="149" REF="172">
and I &s;aw him carried down to the &s;urgeon; but though I was much alarmed for him and wi&s;hed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him I dared not leave my po&s;t. At this &s;tation my gun-mate (a partner in bringing powder for the &s;ame gun) and I ran a very great ri&s;k for more than half an hour of blowing up the &s;hip. For, when we had taken the car|tridges out of the boxes, the bottoms of many of them proving rotten, the powder ran all about the deck, near the match tub: we &s;carcely had water enough at the la&s;t to throw on it. We were al&s;o, from our employment, very much expo&s;ed to the enemy's &s;hots; for we had to go through nearly the whole length of the &s;hip to bring the powder. I expected therefore every minute to be my la&s;t; e&s;pecially when I &s;aw our men fall &s;o thick about me; but, wi&s;hing to guard as much again&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="173">
the dangers as po&s;&s;ible, at fir&s;t I thought it would be &s;afe&s;t not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> road&s;ide; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">  powder: but immediately after|wards I thought this caution was fruit|le&s;s; and, cheering my&s;elf with the re|flection that there was a time allotted for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">to die as well as to be born, I in&s;tantly ca&s;t off all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole of my duty with alacrity; plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the hope, if I &s;ur|vived the battle, of relating it and the dangers I had e&s;caped to the Mi&s;s Guerins, and others, when I &s;hould re|turn to London.</P>
<P>Our &s;hip &s;uffered very much in this engagement; for, be&s;ides the number of our killed and wounded, &s;he was al|mo&s;t torn to pieces, and our rigging &s;o
<PB N="151" REF="174">
much &s;hattered, that our mizen-ma&s;t, main-yard, &amp;c. hung over the &s;ide of the &s;hip; &s;o that we were obliged to get many carpenters, and others from &s;ome of the &s;hips of the fleet, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;etting us in &s;ome tolerable or|der; and, notwith&s;tanding which, it took us &s;ome time before we were complete|ly refitted; after which we le&s;t Admi|ral Broderick to command, and we, with the prizes &s;teered for England. On the pa&s;&s;age, and as &s;oon as my ma&s;ter was &s;omething recovered of his wounds, the admiral appointed him captain of the Aetna fire-&s;hip, on which he and I left the Namur, and went on board of her at &s;ea. I liked this little &s;hip very much. I now became the captain's &s;teward, in which &s;ituation I was very happy: for I was ex|tremely well treated by all on board; and I had lei&s;ure to improve my&s;elf in
<PB N="152" REF="175">
reading and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">ing. The latter I had learned a little of before I left the Na|mur, as there was a &s;chool on board. When we arrived at Spithead, the Aetna went into Port&s;mouth harbour to refit, which being done, we returned to Spichead and joined a large fleet that was thought to be intended again&s;t the Havannah; but about that time the king died; whether that prevented the expedition I know not; but it cau&s;ed our &s;hip to be &s;tationed at Cowes, in the i&s;le of Wight, till the beginning of the year &s;ixty-one. Here I &s;pent my time very plea&s;antly; I was much on &s;hore all about this delightful i&s;land, and found the inhabitants very civil.</P>
<P>While I was here, I met with a trifling incident, which &s;urpri&s;ed me agreeably. I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had a black boy about my own &s;ize; this boy
<PB N="153" REF="176">
having ob&s;erved me from his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, was tran&s;ported at the &s;ight of one of his own countrymen, and ran to meet me with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te. I not knowing what he was about, turned a little out of his way at fir&s;t, but to no purpo&s;e: he &s;oon came clo&s;e to me and caught hold of me in his arms as if I had been his brother, though we had never &s;een each other before. Af|ter we had talked together for &s;ome time he took me to his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, where I was treated very kindly. This benevolent boy and I were very happy in frequently &s;eeing each other till about the month of March 1761, when our &s;hip had orders to fit out again for another expedition. When we got ready, we joined a very large fleet at Spithead, commanded by Commodore Keppel, which was de&s;tined again&s;t Belle-I&s;le, and with a number of tran&s;|port
<PB N="154" REF="177">
&s;hips with troops on board to make a de&s;cent on the place, we &s;ailed once more in que&s;t of fame. I longed to engage in new adventures and &s;ee fre&s;h wonders.</P>
<P>I had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impre&s;&s;ion, and every event which I con&s;idered as marvellous. Every extraordinary e&s;cape, or &s;ignal deliverance, either of my&s;elf or others, I looked upon to be effected by the interpo&s;ition of Provi|dence. We had not been above ten days at &s;ea before an incident of this kind happened; which, whatever cre|dit it may obtain from the reader, made no &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on my mind.</P>
<P>We had on board a gunner, who&s;e name was John Mondle; a man of very indifferent morals. This man's cabin was between the decks, exactly over where I lay, abrea&s;t of the quarter-deck
<PB N="155" REF="178">
ladder. One night, the 5th of April, being terrified with a dream, he awoke in &s;o great a fright that he could not re&s;t in his bed any longer, nor even remain in his cabin; and he went upon deck about four o'clock in the morning extremely agitated. He immediately told tho&s;e on the deck of the agonies of his mind, and the dream which occa&s;ioned it; in which he &s;aid he had &s;een many things very awful, and had been warned by St. Peter to repent, who told him time was &s;hort. This he &s;aid had greatly alarmed him, and he was determined to alter his life. People generally mock the fears of others when they are them&s;elves in &s;afety; and &s;ome of his &s;hipmates who heard him only laughed at him. However, he made a vow that he never would drink &s;trong liquors again; and he immediately got a light, and gave away his &s;ea-&s;tores
<PB N="156" REF="179">
of liquor. After which, his agitation &s;till continuing, he began to read the Scriptures, hoping to find &s;ome relief; and &s;oon afterwards he laid him&s;elf down again on his bed, and endeavoured to compo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;leep, but to no purpo&s;e; his mind &s;till continuing in a &s;tate of agony. By this time it was exactly half after &s;even in the morn|ing: I was then under the half-deck at the great cabin door; and all at once I heard the people in the wai&s;t cry out, mo&s;t fearfully&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The Lord have mercy upon us! We are all lo&s;t! The Lord have mercy upon us!'</Q> Mr. Mondle hearing the cries, immediately ran out of his cabin; and we were in|&s;tantly &s;truck by the Lynne, a forty|gun &s;hip, Captain Clark, which nearly ran us down. This &s;hip had ju&s;t put about, and was by the wind, but had not got full headway, or we mu&s;t all
<PB N="157" REF="180">
have peri&s;hed; for the wind was bri&s;k. However, before Mr Mondle had got four &s;teps from his cabin door, &s;he &s;truck our &s;hip with her cutwater right in the middle of his bed and cabin, and ran it up to the combings of the quarter deck hatchway, and above three feet below water, and in a minute there was not a bit of wood to be &s;een where Mr. Mondle's cabin &s;tood; and he was &s;o near being killed that &s;ome of the &s;plinters tore his face. As Mr. Mon|dle mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed from this accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way I have related, I could not help regarding this as an awful interpo&s;ition of Providence for his pre&s;ervation. The two &s;hips for &s;ome time &s;winged along&s;ide of each other; for ours being a fire&s;hip, our grappling-irons caught the Lynne every way, and the yards and rigging
<PB N="158" REF="181">
went at an a&s;toni&s;hing rate. Our &s;hip was in &s;uch a &s;hocking condition that we all thought &s;he would in&s;tantly go down, and every one ran for their lives, and got as well as they could on board the Lynne; but our lieutenant being the aggre&s;&s;or, he never quitted the &s;hip. However, when we found &s;he did not &s;ink immediately, the captain came on board again, and encouraged our people to return and try to &s;ave her. Many on this came back, but &s;ome would not venture. Some of the &s;hips in the fleet, &s;eeing our &s;ituation; immediately &s;ent their boats to our a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; but it took us the whole day to &s;ave the &s;hip with all their help. And by u&s;ing every po&s;&s;ible means, particularly frapping her together with many haw&s;ers, and putting a great quantity of tallow below water where &s;he was damaged, &s;he was kept to|gether:
<PB N="159" REF="182">
but it was well we did not meet with any gales of wind, or we mu&s;t have gone to pieces; for we were in &s;uch a crazy condition that we had &s;hips to attend us till we arrived at Belle-I&s;le, the place of our de&s;tination; and then we had all things taken out of the &s;hip, and &s;he was properly re|paired. This e&s;cape of Mr. Mon|dle, which he, as well as my&s;elf, always con&s;idered as a &s;ingular act of Provi|dence, I believe had a great influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards.</P>
<P>Now that I am on this &s;ubject I beg leave to relate another in&s;tance or two which &s;trongly rai&s;ed my belief of the particular interpo&s;ition of Heaven, and which might not otherways have found a place here, from their in&s;ignificance. I belonged for a few days in the year 1758, to the Ja&s;on, of fifty-four guns, at Plymouth; and one night, when I
<PB N="160" REF="183">
was on board, a woman, with a child at her brea&s;t, fell from the upper-deck down into the hold, near the keel. Every one thought that the mother and child mu&s;t be both da&s;hed to pieces; but, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, neither of them was hurt. I my&s;elf one day fell headlong from the upper-deck of the Aetna down the after-hold, when the balla&s;t was out; and all who &s;aw me fall cried out I was killed: but I re|ceived not the lea&s;t injury. And in the &s;ame &s;hip a man fell from the ma&s;t|head on the deck without being hurt. In the&s;e, and in many more in&s;tances, I thought I could plainly trace the hand of God, without who&s;e permi&s;|&s;ion a &s;parrow cannot fall. I began to rai&s;e my fear from man to him alone, and to call daily on his holy name with fear and reverence: and I tru&s;t he heard my &s;upplications, and graciou&s;ly
<PB N="161" REF="184">
conde&s;cended to an&s;wer me according to his holy word, and to implant the &s;eeds of piety in me, even one of the meane&s;t of his creatures.</P>
<P>When we had refitted our &s;hip, and all things were in readine&s;s for attack|ing the place, the troops on board the tran&s;ports were ordered to di&s;embark; and my ma&s;ter as a junior captain, had a &s;hare in the command of the landing. This was on the 12th of April. The French were drawn up on the &s;hore, and had made every di&s;po|&s;ition to oppo&s;e the landing of our men, only a &s;mall part of them this day being able to effect it; mo&s;t of them, after fighting with great bravery, were cut off; and General Crawford, with a number of others, were taken pri&s;on|ers. In this day's engagement we had al&s;o our lieutenant killed.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of April we renewed our
<PB N="162" REF="185">
efforts to land the men, while all the men of war were &s;tationed along the &s;hore to cover it, and fired at the French batteries and brea&s;t works from early in the morning till about four o'clock in the evening, when our &s;ol|diers effected a &s;afe landing. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a &s;harp encounter, forced them from the batteries. Before the enemy retreated they blew up &s;everal of them, le&s;t they &s;hould fall into our hands. Our men now proceeded to be&s;iege the citadel, and my ma&s;ter was ordered on &s;hore to &s;uperintend the landing of all the materials nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the &s;iege; in which &s;ervice I mo&s;tly at|tended him. While I was there I went about to different parts of the i&s;land; and one day, particularly, my curio&s;ity almo&s;t co&s;t me my life. I wanted very much to &s;ee the mode of charging the
<PB N="163" REF="186">
mortars and letting off the &s;hells, and for that purpo&s;e I went to an Engli&s;h battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel. There, in|deed, I had an opportunity of completely gratifying my&s;elf in &s;eeing the whole operation, and that not without run|ning a very great ri&s;k, both from the Engli&s;h &s;hells that bur&s;t while I was there, but likewi&s;e from tho&s;e of the French. One of the large&s;t of their &s;hells bur&s;ted within nine or ten yards of me: there was a &s;ingle rock clo&s;e by, about the &s;ize of a butt; and I got in&s;tant &s;helter under it in time to avoid the fury of the &s;hell. Where it bur&s;t the earth was torn in &s;uch a manner that two or three butts might ea&s;ily have gone into the hole it made, and it threw great quantities of &s;tones and dirt to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance.

When I &s;aw what perilous circum&s;tances I was in, I attempted to return the neare&s;t way I could find, and thereby I got between the Engli&s;h and the French centinels. An Engli&s;h &s;erjeant, who commanded the outpo&s;ts, &s;eeing me, and &s;urpri&s;ed how I came there, (which was by &s;tealth along the &s;ea&s;hore), reprimanded me very &s;everely for it, and in&s;tantly took the centinel off his po&s;t into cu&s;tody, for his ne|gligence in &s;uffering me to pa&s;s the lines. While I was in this &s;ituation I ob&s;erved at a little di&s;tance a French hor&s;e, belonging to &s;ome i&s;landers, which I thought I would now mount,
<PB N="165" REF="188">
for the greater expedition of getting off Accordingly I took &s;ome cord which I had about me, and making a kind of bridle of it, I put it round the hor&s;e's head, and the tame bea&s;t very quietly &s;uffered me to tie him thus and mount him. As &s;oon as I was on the hor&s;e's back I began to kick and beat him, and try every means to make him go quick, but all to very little purpo&s;e: I could not drive him out of a &s;low pace. While I was creeping along, &s;till within reach of the enemy's &s;hot, I met with a &s;er|vant well mounted on an Engli&s;h hor&s;e, I immediately &s;topped; and, crying, told him my ca&s;e; and begged of him to help me, and this he effectually did; for, having a fine large whip, he be|gan to la&s;h my hor&s;e with it &s;o &s;e|verely, that he &s;et off full &s;peed with me towards the &s;ea, while I was quite unable to hold or manage him. In

this manner I went along till I came to a craggy precipice. I now could not &s;top my hor&s;e; and my mind was filled with apprehen&s;ions of my deplor|able fate &s;hould he go down the pre|cipice, which he appeared fully di&s;|po&s;ed to do: I therefore thought I had better throw my&s;elf off him at once, which I did immediately with a great deal of dexterity, and fortunately e&s;cap|ed unhurt. As &s;oon as I found my|&s;elf at liberty I made the be&s;t of my way for the &s;hip, determined I would not be &s;o fool-hardy again in a hurry.</P>
<P>We continued to be&s;iege the citadel till June, when it &s;urrendered. During the &s;iege I have counted above &s;ixty &s;hells and carca&s;es in the air at once. When this place was taken I went through the citadel, and in the bomb|proofs under it, which were cut in the &s;olid rock; and I thought it a &s;urpri&s;ing

place, both for &s;trength and building: notwith&s;tanding which our &s;hots and &s;hells had made amazing deva&s;tation, and ruinous heaps all around it.</P>
<P>After the taking of this i&s;land, our &s;hips with &s;ome others commanded by commodore Stanhope in the Swift|&s;ure, went to Ba&s;&s;e-road, where we blocked up a French fleet. Our &s;hips were there from June till February fol|lowing; and in that time I &s;aw a great many &s;cenes of war, and &s;tratagems on both &s;ides to de&s;troy each others fleet. Sometimes we would attack the French with &s;ome &s;hips of the line; at other times with boats; and frequently we made prizes. Once or twice the French attacked us by throwing &s;hells with their bomb-ve&s;&s;els; and one day as a French ve&s;&s;el was throwing &s;hells at our &s;hips &s;he broke from her &s;prings, behind the i&s;le of I de Re: the tide be|ing

complicated, &s;he came within a gun &s;hot of the Na&s;&s;au; but the Na&s;&s;au could not bring a gun to bear upon her, and thereby the Frenchman got off. We were twice attacked by their fire floats, which they chained together, and then let them float down with the tide; but each time we &s;ent boats with graplings, and towed them &s;afe out of the fleet.</P>
<P>We had different commanders while we were at this place, Commodores Stanhope, Dennis, Lord Howe, &amp;c.

<P>After our &s;hip was fitted out again for &s;ervice, in September &s;he went to Guern&s;ey, where I was very glad to &s;ee
<PB N="170" REF="193">
my old ho&s;te&s;s, who was now a widow, and my former little charming com|panion, her daughter. I &s;pent &s;ome time here very happily with them, till October, when we had orders to re|pair to Port&s;mouth. We parted from each other with a great deal of affec|tion; and I promi&s;ed to return &s;oon, and &s;ee them again; not knowing what all-powerful fate had determined for me. Our &s;hip having arrived at Port&s;|mouth, we went into the harbour, and remained there till the latter end of November, when we heard great talk about a peace; and, to our very great joy, in the beginning of December we had orders to go up to London with our &s;hip to be paid off. We re|ceived this news with loud huzzas, and every other demon&s;tration of glad|ne&s;s; and nothing but mirth was to be &s;een throughout every part of the
<PB N="171" REF="194">
&s;hip. I too was not without my &s;hare of the general joy on this occa|&s;ion. I thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for my&s;elf, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good education; for I al|ways had a great de&s;ire to be able at lea&s;t to read and write; and while I was on &s;hip-board I had endeavoured to improve my&s;elf in both. While I was in the Aetna particularly, the cap|tain's clerk taught me to write, and gave me a &s;mattering of arithmetic as far as the rule of three. There was al&s;o one Daniel Queen, about forty years of age, a man very well educat|ed, who me&s;&s;ed with me on board this &s;hip, and he likewi&s;e dre&s;&s;ed and at|tended the captain. Fortunately this man &s;oon became very much attached to me, and took very great pains to in|&s;truct me in many things. He taught
<PB N="172" REF="195">
me to &s;have and dre&s;s hair a little, and al&s;o to read in the Bible, explaining many pa&s;&s;ages to me, which I did not comprehend. I was wonderfully &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee the laws and rules of my own country written almo&s;t exactly here; a circum&s;tance which I believe tended to impre&s;s our manners and cu&s;toms more deeply on my memory. I u&s;ed to tell him of this re&s;emblance; and many a time we have &s;at up the whole night together at this employment. In &s;hort, he was like a father to me; and &s;ome even u&s;ed to call me after his name; they al&s;o &s;tyled me the black Chri&s;tian. Indeed I almo&s;t lov|ed him with the affection of a &s;on. Many things I have denied my&s;elf that he might have them; and when I u&s;ed to play at marbles or any other game, and won a few halfpence, or got any little money, which I &s;ome|times
<PB N="173" REF="196">
did, for &s;having any one, I u&s;ed to buy him a little &s;ugar or tobacco, as far as my &s;tock of money would go. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he and I never &s;hould part; and that when our &s;hip was paid off, as I was as free as him|&s;elf or any other man on board, he would in&s;truct me in his bu&s;ine&s;s, by which I might gain a good livelihood. This gave me new life and &s;pirits; and my heart burned within me, while I thought the time long till I obtained my freedom. For though my ma&s;ter had not promi&s;ed it to me, yet, be&s;ides the a&s;&s;urances I had received that he had no right to detain me, he always treated me with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s, and repo&s;ed in me an unbounded con|fidence; he even paid attention to my morals; and would never &s;uffer me to deceive him, or tell lies, of which he u&s;ed to tell me the con&s;equences; and
<PB N="174" REF="197">
that if I did &s;o God would not love me; &s;o that from all this tenderne&s;s, I had never once &s;uppo&s;ed, in all my dreams of freedom, that he would think of detaining me any longer than I wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of our orders we &s;ailed from Port&s;mouth for the Thames, and arrived at Deptford the 10th of De|cember, where we ca&s;t anchor ju&s;t as it was high water. The &s;hip was up about half an hour, when my ma&s;ter ordered the barge to be manned; and all in an in&s;tant, without having before given me the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any thing of the matter, he forced me into the barge; &s;aying, I was going to leave him, but he would take care I &s;hould not. I was &s;o &s;truck with the unex|pectedne&s;s of this proceeding, that for &s;ome time I did not make a reply, only I made an offer to go for my
<PB N="175" REF="198">
books and che&s;t of clothes, but he &s;wore I &s;hould not move out of his &s;ight; and if I did he would cut my throat, at the &s;ame time taking his hanger. I began, however, to collect my&s;elf; and, plucking up courage, I told him I was free, and he could not by law &s;erve me &s;o. But this only enraged him the more; and he con|tinued to &s;wear, and &s;aid he would &s;oon let me know whether he would or not, and at that in&s;tant &s;prung him|&s;elf into the barge from the &s;hip, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;orrow of all on board. The tide, rather unluckily for me, had ju&s;t turned downward, &s;o that we quickly fell down the river along with it, till we came among &s;ome out|ward-bound We&s;t Indiamen; for he was re&s;olved to put me on board the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el he could get to receive me. The boat's crew, who pulled again&s;t
<PB N="176" REF="199">
their will, became quite faint di&s;&s;erent times, and would have gone a&s;hore; but he would not let them. Some of them &s;trove then to cheer me, and told me he could not &s;ell me, and that they would &s;tand by me, which revived me a little; and I &s;till entertained hopes; for as they pulled along he a&s;ked &s;ome ve&s;&s;els to receive me, but they would not. But, ju&s;t as we had got a little below Grave&s;end, we came along&s;ide of a &s;hip which was going away the next tide for the We&s;t Indies; her name was the Charming Sally, Captain James Doran; and my ma&s;ter went on board and agreed with him for me; and in a little time I was &s;ent &s;or into the cabin. When I came there Cap|tain Doran a&s;ked me if I knew him: I an&s;wered that I did not; <Q REND="inline">'Then,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'you are now my &s;lave.'</Q> I told him my ma&s;ter could not &s;ell me

My ma&s;ter, having &s;oon concluded his bargain with the captain, came out of the cabin, and he and his people got into the boat and put off; I followed them with aching eyes as long as I could, and when they were out of &s;ight I threw my&s;elf on the deck, with a heart ready to bur&s;t with &s;er|row and angui&s;h.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS, at the moment I expected all my toils to end, was I plunged, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, in a new &s;lavery; in compa|ri&s;on of which all my &s;ervice hitherto
<PB N="181" REF="204">
had been perfect freedom; and who&s;e horrors, always pre&s;ent to my mind, now ru&s;hed on it with tenfold aggra|vation. I wept very bitterly for &s;ome time: and began to think that I mu&s;t have done &s;omething to di&s;plea&s;e the Lord, that he thus puni&s;hed me &s;o &s;e|verely. This filled me with painful reflections on my pa&s;t conduct; I re|collected that on the morning of our arrival at Deptford I had ra&s;hly &s;worn that as &s;oon as we reached London I would &s;pend the day in rambling and &s;port. My con&s;cience &s;mote me for this unguarded expre&s;&s;ion: I felt that the Lord was able to di&s;appoint me in all things, and immediately con&s;ider|ed my pre&s;ent &s;ituation as a judgment of Heaven on account of my pre&s;ump|tion in &s;wearing: I therefore, with con|trition of heart, acknowledged my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to God, and poured out
<PB N="182" REF="205">
my &s;oul before him with unfeigned re|pentance, and with earne&s;t &s;upplica|tions I be&s;ought him not to abandon me in my di&s;tre&s;s, nor ca&s;t me from his mercy for ever. In a little time my grief, &s;pent with its own violence, began to &s;ub&s;ide; and after the fir&s;t confu&s;ion of my thoughts was over I reflected with more calmne&s;s on my pre&s;ent condition: I con&s;idered that trials and di&s;appointments are &s;ome|times for our good, and I thought God might perhaps have permitted this in order to teach me wi&s;dom and re&s;igna|tion; for he had hitherto &s;hadowed me with the wings of his mercy, and by his invi&s;ible but powerful hand brought me the way I knew not. The&s;e re|flections gave me a little comfort, and I ro&s;e at la&s;t from the deck with de|jection and &s;orrow in my countenance, yet mixed with &s;ome faint hope that
<PB N="183" REF="206">
the <HI>Lord would appear</HI> for my deli|verance.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, as my new ma&s;ter was going on &s;hore, he called me to him, and told me to behave my&s;elf well, and do the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;hip the &s;ame as any of the re&s;t of the boys, and that I &s;hould &s;are the better for it; but I made him no an&s;wer. I was then a&s;ked If I could &s;wim, and I &s;aid, No, How|ever I was made to go under the deck, and was well watched. The next tide the &s;hip got under way, and &s;oon after arrived at the Mother Bank, Port&s;mouth; where &s;he waited a few days for &s;ome of the We&s;t India convoy. While I was here I tried every means I could devi&s;e among&s;t the people of the &s;hip to get me a boat from the &s;hore, as there was none &s;uf|fered to come along&s;ide of the &s;hip; and their own, whenever it was u&s;ed,
<PB N="184" REF="207">
was hoi&s;ted in again immediately. A &s;ailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of getting me a boat; and promi&s;ed me, time after time, that it was hourly to come off. When he had the watch upon deck I watched al&s;o; and looked long enough, but all in vain; I could never &s;ee either the boat or my guinea again. And what I thought was &s;till the wor&s;t of all, the fellow gave information, as I after|wards found, all the while to the mates, of my intention to go off, if I could in any way do it; but, rogue like, he never told them he had got a guinea from me to procure my e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">e.

not forget heir promi&s;e to come for me to Port&s;mouth: and, indeed, at la&s;t, but not till the day before we &s;ailed, &s;ome of them did come there, and &s;ent me off &s;ome oranges, and other tokens of their regard. They al&s;o &s;ent me word they would come off to me them&s;elves the next day or the day after; and a lady al&s;o, who lived in Go&s;port, wrote to me that &s;he would come and take me out of the &s;hip at the &s;ame time. This lady had been once very intimate with my former ma&s;ter: I u&s;ed to &s;ell and take care of a great deal of property for her, in dif|ferent &s;hips; and in return &s;he always &s;hewed great friend&s;hip for me, and u&s;ed to tell my ma&s;ter that &s;he would take me away to live with her: but, un|fortunately for me, a di&s;agreement &s;oon afterwards took place between them; and &s;he was &s;ucceeded in my ma&s;ter's
<PB N="186" REF="209">
good graces by another lady, who ap|peared &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the Aetna, and mo&s;tly lodged on board. I was not &s;o great a favourite with this lady as with the former; &s;he had conceived a pique again&s;t me on &s;ome occa&s;ion when &s;he was on board, and &s;he did not fail to in&s;tigate my ma&s;ter to treat me in the manner he did<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus was I &s;acrificed to the envy and re&s;ent|ment of this woman for knowing that the lady whom &s;he had &s;ucceeded in my ma&s;ter's good graces de&s;igned to take me into her &s;ervice; which, had I once got on &s;hore, &s;he would not have been able to present. She felt her pride alarmed at the &s;uperiority of her rival in being attended by a black &s;ervant: it was not le&s;s to prevent this than to be revenged on me, that &s;he cau&s;ed the captain to treat me thus cruelly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, the next morning, the 30th of December, the wind being bri&s;k and ea&s;terly, the Aeolus frigate, which was to e&s;cort the convoy, made a &s;ignal for failing. All the &s;hips
<PB N="187" REF="210">
then got up their anchors; and, be|fore any of my friends had an oppor|tunity to come off to my relief, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h our &s;hip had got under way. What tumultuous emotions agitated my &s;oul when the convoy got under &s;ail, and I a pri&s;oner on board, now without hope!

The turbulence of my emotions how|ever naturally gave way to calmer thoughts, and I &s;oon perceived what fate had decreed no mortal on earth could prevent.

At the &s;ight of this land of bondage, a fre&s;h horror ran through all my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ame, and chilled me to the heart. My for|mer &s;lavery now ro&s;e in dreadful re|view to my mind, and di&s;played no|thing but mi&s;ery, &s;tripes, and chains; and, in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of my grief, I called upon God's thunder, and his avenging power, to direct the &s;troke of death to me, rather than permit me to become a &s;lave, and be &s;old from lord to lord.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of my mind our &s;hip came to an anchor, and &s;oon after di&s;|charged her cargo. I now knew what it was to work hard; I was made to help to unload and load the &s;hip. And, to comfort me in my di&s;tre&s;s in that time, two of the &s;ailors robbed me of all my money, and ran away from the &s;hip. I had been &s;o long u&s;ed to an European climate, that at
<PB N="191" REF="214">
fir&s;t I felt the &s;corching We&s;t India &s;un very painful, while the da&s;hing &s;urf would to&s;s the boat and the peo|ple in it frequently above high water mark. Sometimes our limbs were broken with this, or even attended with in&s;tant death, and I was day by day mangled and torn.</P>
<P>About the middle of May, when the &s;hip was got ready to &s;ail for England, I all the time believing that Fate's blacke&s;t clouds were gathering over my head, and expecting their bur&s;ting would mix me with the dead, Cap|tain Doran &s;ent for me a&s;hore one morning, and I was told by the me&s;|&s;enger that my fate was then deter|mined. With trembling &s;teps and fluttering heart I came to the captain, and found with him one Mr. Robert King, a quaker, and the fir&s;t merchant in the place. The captain then told
<PB N="192" REF="215">
me my former ma&s;ter had &s;ent me there to be &s;old; but that he had de|&s;ired him to get me the be&s;t ma&s;ter he could, as he told him I was a very de|&s;erving boy, which Captain Doran &s;aid he found to be true; and if he were to &s;tay in the We&s;t Indies he would be glad to keep me him&s;elf; but he could not venture to take me to Lon|don, for he was very &s;ure that when I came there I would leave him. I at that in&s;tant bur&s;t out a crying, and begged much of him to take me to England with him, but all to no pur|po&s;e. He told me he had got me the very be&s;t ma&s;ter in the whole i&s;land, with whom I &s;hould be as happy as if I were in England, and for that rea&s;on he cho&s;e to let him have me, though he could &s;ell me to his own brother-in-law for a great deal more money than what he got from this gentleman.
<PB N="193" REF="216">
Mr. King, my new ma&s;ter, then made a reply, and &s;aid the rea&s;on he had bought me was on account of my good character; and, as he had not the lea&s;t doubt of my good behaviour, I &s;hould be very well off with him. He al&s;o told me he did not live in the We&s;t Indies, but at Philadelphia, where he was going &s;oon; and, as I under&s;tood &s;omething of the rules of arithmetic, when we got there he would put me to &s;chool, and fit me for a clerk. This conver&s;ation relieved my mind a little, and I left tho&s;e gentlemen con&s;iderably more at ea&s;e in my&s;elf than when I came to them; and I was very thank|ful to Captain Doran, and even to my old ma&s;ter, for the character they had given me; a character which I after|wards found of infinite &s;ervice to me. I went on board again, and took leave of all my &s;hipmates; and the next day
<PB N="194" REF="217">
the &s;hip &s;ailed. When &s;he weighed anchor I went to the water&s;ide and looked at her with a very wi&s;hful and aching heart, and followed her with my eyes until &s;he was totally out of &s;ight. I was &s;o bowed down with grief that I could not hold up my head for many months; and if my new ma&s;ter had not been kind to me I be|lieve I &s;hould have died under it at la&s;t. And indeed I &s;oon found that he fully de&s;erved the good character which Cap|tain Doran had given me of him; for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;i|tion and temper, and was very chari|table and humane. If any of his &s;laves behaved ami&s;s he did not beat or u&s;e them ill, but parted with them. This made them afraid of di&s;obliging him; and as he treated his &s;laves better than any other man on the i&s;land, &s;o he was better and more faithfully &s;erved
<PB N="195" REF="218">
by them in return. By this kind treat|ment I did at la&s;t endeavour to com|po&s;e my&s;elf; and with fortitude, though moneyle&s;s, determined to face what|ever fate had decreed for me. Mr. King &s;oon a&s;ked me what I could do; and at the &s;ame time &s;aid he did not mean to treat me as a common &s;lave. I told him I knew &s;omething of &s;ea|man&s;hip, and could &s;have and dre&s;s hair pretty well; and I could refine wines, which I had learned on &s;hip|board, where I had often done it; and that I could write, and under&s;tood arithmetic tolerably well as far as the Rule of Three. He then a&s;ked me if I knew any thing of gauging; and, on my an&s;wering that I did not, he &s;aid one of his clerks &s;hould teach me to guage.</P>
<P>Mr. King dealt in all manner of merchandize, and kept from one to
<PB N="196" REF="219">
&s;ix clerks. He loaded many ve&s;&s;els in a year; particularly to Philadelphia, where he was born, and was connected with a great mercantile hou&s;e in that city. He had be&s;ides many ve&s;&s;els and droggers, of different &s;izes, which u&s;ed to go about the i&s;land; and others to collect rum, &s;ugar, and other goods. I under&s;tood pulling and managing tho&s;e boats very well; and this hard work, which was the fir&s;t that he &s;et me to, in the &s;ugar &s;ea&s;ons u&s;ed to be my con&s;tant employment. I have rowed the boat, and &s;laved at the oars, from one hour to &s;ixteen in the twenty-four; during which I had fif|teen pence &s;terling per day to live on, though &s;ometimes only ten pence. However this was con&s;iderably more than was allowed to other &s;laves that u&s;ed to work often with me, and be|longed to other gentlemen on the
<PB N="197" REF="220">
i&s;land: tho&s;e poor &s;ouls had never more than nine-pence per day, and &s;eldom more than &s;ix-pence, from their ma&s;ters or owners, though they earned them three or four pi&s;terines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e pi&s;terines are of the value of a &s;hilling.</NOTE>: for it is a common practice in the We&s;t Indies for men to purcha&s;e &s;laves though they have not plantations them|&s;elves, in order to let them out to planters and merchants at &s;o much a piece by the day, and they give what allowance they chu&s;e out of this pro|duce of their daily work to their &s;laves for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; this allowance is often very &s;canty. My ma&s;ter often gave the owners of the&s;e &s;laves two and a half of the&s;e pieces per day, and found the poor fellows in victuals him&s;elf, be|cau&s;e he thought their owners did not feed them well enough according to the
<PB N="198" REF="221">
work they did. The &s;laves u&s;ed to like this very well; and, as they knew my ma&s;ter to be a man of feeling, they were always glad to work for him in preference to any other gentleman; &s;ome of whom after they had been paid for the&s;e poor people's labours, would not give them their allowance out of it. Many times have I even &s;een the&s;e unfortunate wretches beaten for a&s;king for their pay; and often &s;everely flogged by their owners if they did not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time; though the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had worked for &s;ometimes for more than half the day before they could get their pay; and this generally on Sun|days, when they wanted the time for them&s;elves. In particular, I knew a countryman of mine who once did not
<PB N="199" REF="222">
bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and though he brought it the &s;ame day to his ma&s;ter, yet he was &s;taked to the ground for his pre|tended negligence, and was ju&s;t going to receive a hundred la&s;hes, but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty. This poor man was very indu&s;trious; and, by his frugality, had &s;aved &s;o much money by working on &s;hipboard, that he had got a white man to buy him a boat, unknown to his ma&s;ter. Some time after he had this little e&s;tate, the governor wanted a boat to bring his &s;ugar from different parts of the i&s;land; and, knowing this to be a negro-man's boat, he &s;eized upon it for him&s;elf, and would not pay the owner a farthing. The man on this went to his ma&s;ter, and complained to him of this act of the governor; but the only &s;atisfaction he received
<PB N="200" REF="223">
was to be damned very heartily by his ma&s;ter, who a&s;ked him how dare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> any of his negroes to have a boat. If the ju&s;tly-merited ruin of the go|vernor's fortune could be any grati|fication to the poor man he had thus robbed, he was not without con&s;ola|tion. Extortion and rapine are poor providers; and &s;ome time after this the governor died in the King's Bench in England, as I was told, in great poverty. The la&s;t war favoured this poor negro-man, and he found &s;ome means to e&s;cape from his Chri&s;tian ma&s;ter: he came to England; where I &s;aw him afterwards &s;everal times. Such treatment as this often drives the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches to de&s;pair, and they run away from their ma&s;ters at the hazard of their lives. Many of them, in this place, unable to get their pay when they have earned it, and fear|ing
<PB N="201" REF="224">
to be flogged, as u&s;ual, if they return home without it, run away where they can for &s;helter, and a re|ward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive. My ma&s;ter u&s;ed &s;ome|times, in the&s;e ca&s;es, to agree with their owners, and to &s;ettle with them him|&s;elf; and thereby he &s;aved many of them a flogging.</P>
<P>Once, for a few days, I was let out to fit a ve&s;&s;el, and I had no victuals allowed me by either party; at la&s;t I told my ma&s;ter of this treatment, and he took me away from it. In many of the e&s;tates, on the different i&s;lands where I u&s;ed to be &s;ent for rum or &s;ugar, they would not deliver it to me, or any other negro; he was therefore obliged to &s;end a white man along with me to tho&s;e places; and then he u&s;ed to pay him from &s;ix to ten pi&s;|terines a day. From being thus em|ployed,
<PB N="202" REF="225">
during the time I &s;erved Mr. King, in going about the different e&s;tates on the i&s;land, I had all the op|portunity I could wi&s;h for to &s;ee the dreadful u&s;age of the poor men; u&s;age that reconciled me to my &s;ituation, and made me ble&s;s God for the hands into which I had fallen.</P>
<P>I had the good fortune to plea&s;e my ma&s;ter in every department in which he employed me; and there was &s;carcely any part of his bu&s;ine&s;s, or hou&s;hold affairs, in which I was not occa&s;ionally engaged. I often &s;up|plied the place of a clerk, in receiving and delivering cargoes to the &s;hips, in tending &s;tores, and delivering goods: and, be&s;ides this, I u&s;ed to &s;have and dre&s;s my ma&s;ter when convenient, and take care of his hor&s;e; and when it was nece&s;&s;ary, which was very often, I worked likewi&s;e on board of different
<PB N="203" REF="226">
ve&s;&s;els of his. By the&s;e means I be|came very u&s;eful to my ma&s;ter; and &s;aved him, as he u&s;ed to acknowledge, above a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he &s;cruple to &s;ay I was of more ad|vantage to him than any of his clerks; though their u&s;ual wages in the We&s;t Indies are from &s;ixty to a hundred pounds current a year.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes heard it a&s;&s;erted that a negro cannot earn his ma&s;ter the fir&s;t co&s;t; but nothing can be fur|ther from the truth. I &s;uppo&s;e nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the We&s;t Indies are negro &s;laves; and I well know the coopers among them earn two dollars a day; the carpenters the &s;ame, and oftentimes more; as al&s;o the ma&s;ons, &s;miths, and fi&s;her|men, &amp;c. and I have known many &s;laves who&s;e ma&s;ters would not take a thou&s;and pounds current for them.
<PB N="204" REF="227">
But &s;urely this a&s;&s;ertion refutes it&s;elf; for, if it be true, why do the planters and merchants pay &s;uch a price for &s;laves? And, above all, why do tho&s;e who make this a&s;&s;ertion exclaim the mo&s;t loudly again&s;t the abolition of the &s;lave trade? So much are men blinded, and to &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tent arguments are they driven by mi&s;taken intere&s;t! I grant, indeed, that &s;laves are &s;ome times, by half-feeding, half-clothing, over-working and &s;tripes, reduced &s;o low, that they are turned out as unfit for &s;ervice, and left to peri&s;h in the woods, or expire on a dunghill.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter was &s;everal times offered by different gentlemen one hundred guineas for me; but he always told them he would not &s;ell me, to my great joy: and I u&s;ed to double my di|ligence and care for fear of getting into the hands of tho&s;e men who did not
<PB N="205" REF="228">
allow a valuable &s;lave the common &s;upport of life. Many of them even u&s;ed to find fault with my ma&s;ter for feeding his &s;laves &s;o well as he did; although I often went hungry, and an Engli&s;hman might think my fare very indifferent; but he u&s;ed to tell them he always would do it, becau&s;e the &s;laves thereby looked better and did more work.</P>
<P>While I was thus employed by my ma&s;ter I was often a witne&s;s to cruelties of every kind, which were exerci&s;ed on my unhappy fellow &s;laves. I u&s;ed frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in my care for &s;ale; and it was almo&s;t a con&s;tant practice with our clerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the cha&s;tity of the female &s;laves; and the&s;e I was, though with reluctance, obliged to &s;ubmit to at all times, being unable to
<PB N="206" REF="229">
help them. When we have had &s;ome of the&s;e &s;laves on board my ma&s;ter's ve&s;&s;els to carry them to other i&s;lands, or to America, I have known our mates to commit the&s;e acts mo&s;t &s;hamefully, to the di&s;grace, not of Chri&s;tians only, but of men. I have even known them gratify their brutal pa&s;&s;ion with females not ten years old; and the&s;e abomi|nations &s;ome of them practi&s;ed to &s;uch &s;candalous exce&s;s, that one of our cap|tains di&s;charged the mate and others on that account. And yet in Mont|&s;errat I have &s;een a negro man &s;taked to the ground, and cut mo&s;t &s;hock|ingly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, becau&s;e he had been connected with a white woman who was a com|mon pro&s;titute: as if it were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent Afri|can girl of her virtue; but mo&s;t hein|ous in a black man only to gratify a
<PB N="207" REF="230">
pa&s;&s;ion of nature, where the tempta|tion was offered by one of a different colour, though the mo&s;t abandoned woman of her &s;pecies.</P>
<P>One Mr. D&mdash; told me that he had &s;old 41000 negroes, and that he once cut off a negro-man's leg for running away&mdash;I a&s;ked him if the man had died in the operation, how he as a chri&s;tian could an&s;wer for the horrid act before God? and he told me, an&s;wering was a thing of ano|ther world; what he thought and did were policy. I told him that the chri&s;tian doctrine taught us to do unto others as we would that others &s;hould do unto us. He then &s;aid that his &s;cheme had the de&s;ired effect&mdash;it cur|ed that man and &s;ome others of run|ning away.</P>
<P>Another negro-man was half hanged, and then burnt, for attempting to poi|&s;on
<PB N="208" REF="231">
a cruel over&s;eer. Thus by re|peated cruelties are the wretched fir&s;t urged to de&s;pair, and then murdered, becau&s;e they &s;till retain &s;o much of hu|man nature about them as to wi&s;h to put an end to their mi&s;ery, and retali|ate on their tyrants! The&s;e over&s;eers are indeed for the mo&s;t part per&s;ons of the wor&s;t character of any denomina|tion of men in the We&s;t Indies. Un|fortunately, many humane gentlemen, by not re&s;iding on their e&s;tates, are obliged to leave the management of them in the hands of the&s;e human butchers, who cut and mangle the &s;laves in a &s;hocking manner on the mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ions, and altogether treat them in every re&s;pect like brutes. They pay no regard to the &s;ituation of pregnant women, nor the lea&s;t atten|tion to the lodging of the field negroes. Their huts, which ought to be well co|vered, and the place dry where they
<PB N="209" REF="232">
take their little repo&s;e, are often open &s;heds, built in damp places; &s;o that, when the poor creatures return tired from the toils of the field, they con|tract many di&s;orders, from being ex|po&s;ed to the damp air in this uncom|fortable &s;tate, while they are heated, and their pores are open. This neg|lect certainly con&s;pires with many others to cau&s;e a decrea&s;e in the births as well as in the lives of the grown negroes. I can quote many in&s;tances of gentlemen who re&s;ide on their e&s;tates in the we&s;t Indies, and then the &s;cene is quite changed; the ne|groes are treated with lenity and pro|per care, by which their lives are pro|longed, and their ma&s;ters profited. To the honour of humanity, I knew &s;everal gentlemen who managed their e&s;tates in this manner; and they found that benevolence was their true inte|re&s;t.
<PB N="210" REF="233">
And, among many I could men|tion in &s;everal of the i&s;lands, I knew one in Mont&s;errat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dubury, and many others, Mont&s;errat.</NOTE> who&s;e &s;laves look|ed remarkably well, and never needed any fre&s;h &s;upplies of negroes; and there are many other e&s;tates, e&s;pecially in Barbadoes, which, from &s;uch judicious treatment, need no fre&s;h &s;tock of ne|groes at any time.

he &s;aves the lives of his negroes, and keeps them healthy, and as happy as the condition of &s;lavery can admit. I my&s;elf, as &s;hall appear in the &s;equel, managed an e&s;tate, where, by tho&s;e at|tentions, the negroes were uncommon|ly cheerful and healthy, and did more work by half than by the common mode of treatment they u&s;ually do. For want, therefore, of &s;uch care and atten|tion to the poor negroes, and otherwi&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed as they are, it is no wonder that the decrea&s;e &s;hould require 20,000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant places of the dead.</P>

<P>While I was in Mont&s;errat I knew a negro man, named Emanuel Sankey, who endeavoured to e&s;cape from his mi&s;erable bondage, by concealing him|&s;elf on board of a London &s;hip: but fate did not favour the poor oppre&s;&s;ed man; for, being di&s;covered when the ve&s;&s;el was under &s;ail, he was delivered up again to his ma&s;ter. This <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="236">
<HI>ma&s;ter</HI> immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wri&s;t and ancle, and then took &s;ome &s;ticks of &s;eal|ing wax, and lighted them, and drop|ed it all over his back. There was an|other ma&s;ter who was noted for cruelty; and I believe he had not a &s;lave but what had been cut, and had pieces fairly taken out of the fle&s;h: and after they had been puni&s;hed thus, he u&s;ed to make them get into a long wooden box or ca&s;e he had for that purpo&s;e, in which he &s;hut them up during plea&s;ure.

<P>It was very common in &s;everal of the i&s;lands, particularly in St. Kitt's, for the &s;laves to be branded with the initial letters of their ma&s;ter's name; and a load of heavy iron hooks hung about their necks. Indeed on the mo&s;t

in all the different i&s;lands in which I have been (and I have vi&s;ited no le&s;s than fifteen) the treatment of the &s;lave, was nearly the &s;ame; &s;o nearly indeed, that the hi&s;tory of an i&s;land, or even a plantation, with a few &s;uch exceptions as I have mentioned, might &s;erve for a hi&s;tory of the whole.

violates that fir&s;t natural right of man|kind, equality and independency, and gives one man a dominion over his fellows which God could never intend!

<P>IN the precedeing chapter I have &s;et before the reader a few of tho&s;e many in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion, extortion, and cruelty, which I have been a witne&s;s

The puni&s;h|ments of the &s;laves on every trifling oc|ca&s;ion are &s;o frequent, and &s;o well known together with the different in&s;truments with which they are tortured, that it cannot any longer afford novelty to recite them; and they are too &s;hock|ing to yield delight either to the writer or the reader. I &s;hall therefore here|after only mention &s;uch as incidentally befell my&s;elf in the cour&s;e of my ad|ventures.</P>
<P>In the variety of departments in which I was employed by my ma&s;ter, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing many cu|rious &s;cenes in different i&s;lands; but, above all, I was &s;truck with a celebrated curio&s;ity called Brim&s;tone-Hill, which is a high and &s;teep mountain, &s;ome few miles from the town of Plymouth in Mont&s;errat. I had often heard of &s;ome

I had taken &s;ome potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled. I ta&s;ted &s;ome of them, but they were very &s;ulphurous; and the &s;ilver &s;hoe buckles, and all the other things of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time turned as black as lead.</P>
<P>Some time in the year 1763, kind Pro|vidence &s;eemed to appear rather more favourable to me. One of my ma&s;ter's ve&s;&s;els, a Bermudas &s;loop, about &s;ixty tons burthen was commanded by one
<PB N="231" REF="254">
Captain Thomas Farmer, an Engli&s;h|man, a very alert and active man, who gained my ma&s;ter a great deal of mo|ney by his good mangement in carry|ing pa&s;&s;engers from one i&s;land to ano|ther; but very often his &s;ailors u&s;ed to get drunk and run away from the ve&s;&s;el, which hindered him in his bu&s;ine&s;s very much. This man had taken a liking to me; and many different times begged of my ma&s;ter to let me go a trip with him as a &s;ailor; but he would tell him he could not &s;pare me, though the ve&s;|&s;el &s;ometimes could not go for want of hands, for &s;ailors were generally very &s;carce in the i&s;land. However, at la&s;t, from nece&s;&s;ity or force, my ma&s;ter was prevailed on, though very reluctantly, to let me go with this captain; but he gave him great charge to take care that I did not run away, for if I did he would make him pay for me. This being the ca&s;e, the captain had for
<PB N="232" REF="255">
&s;ome time a &s;harp eye upon me when|ever the ve&s;&s;el anchored; and as &s;oon as &s;he returned I was &s;ent for on &s;hore again. Thus was I &s;laving as it were for life, &s;ometimes at one thing, and &s;ometimes at another; &s;o that the cap|tain and I were nearly the mo&s;t u&s;eful men in my ma&s;ter's employment. I al&s;o became &s;o u&s;eful to the captain on &s;hipboard, that many times, when he u&s;ed to a&s;k for me to go with him, though it &s;hould be but for twenty|four hours, to &s;ome of the i&s;lands near us, my ma&s;ter would an&s;wer he could not &s;pare me, at which the captain would &s;wear, and would no go the trip; and tell my ma&s;ter I was better to him on board than any three white men he had; for they u&s;ed to behave ill in many re&s;pects, particularly in getting drunk; and then they frequently got the boat &s;tove, &s;o as to hinder the ve&s;|&s;el from coming back as &s;oon as &s;he
<PB N="233" REF="256">
might have done. This my ma&s;ter knew very well; and at la&s;t, by the captain's con&s;tant entreaties, after I had been &s;everal times with him, one day to my great joy, told me the captain would not let him re&s;t, and a&s;ked whether I would go aboard as a &s;ailor, or &s;tay on &s;hore and mind the &s;tores, for he could not bear any longer to be plagued in this manner. I was very happy at this propo&s;al, for I immediately thought I might in time &s;tand &s;ome chance by being on board to get a little money, or po&s;&s;ibly make my e&s;cape if I &s;hould be u&s;ed ill: I al&s;o expected to get better food, and in greater abundance; for I had oftentimes felt much hunger, though my ma&s;ter treated his &s;laves, as I have ob&s;erved, uncommonly well. I therefore, with|out he&s;itation, an&s;wered him, that I would go and be a &s;ailor if he plea&s;ed. Accordingly I was ordered on board
<PB N="234" REF="257">
directly. Neverthele&s;s, between the ve&s;&s;el and the &s;hore, when &s;he was in port, I had little or no re&s;t, as my ma&s;ter always wi&s;hed to have me along with him. Indeed he was a very plea|&s;ant gentleman, and but for my expec|tations on &s;hipboard I &s;hould not have thought of leaving him. But the cap|tain liked me al&s;o very much, and I was entirely his right-hand man. I did all I could to de&s;erve his favour, and in return I received better treatment from him than any other I believe ever met with in the We&s;t Indies in my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>After I had been &s;ailing for &s;ome time with this captain, at length I endea|voured to try my luck and commence merchant. I had but a very &s;mall ca|pital to begin with; for one &s;ingle half bit, which is equal to three-pence in England, made up my whole &s;tock. However I tru&s;ted to the Lord to be
<PB N="235" REF="258">
with me; and at one of our trips to <HI>St. Eu&s;tatia,</HI> a Dutch i&s;land, I bought a gla&s;s tumbler with my half bit, and when I came to Mont&s;errat I &s;old it for a bit, or &s;ix-pence. Luckily we made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trips to St. Eu&s;tatia (which was a general mart for the We&s;t Indies, about twenty leagues from Mont&s;errat) and in our next, finding my tumbler &s;o profitable, with this one bit I bought two tumblers more; and when I came back I &s;old them for two bits equal to a &s;hilling &s;terling. When we went again I bought with the&s;e two bits four more of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, which I &s;old for fout bits on our return to Mont&s;errat: and in our next voyage to St. Eu&s;tatia, I bought two gla&s;&s;es with one bit, and with the other three I bought a jug of Geneva, nearly about three pints in mea&s;ure. When we came to Mont&s;errat, I &s;old the gin for eight bits, and the tumblers for two, &s;o that
<PB N="236" REF="259">
my capital now amounted in all to a dollar, well hu&s;banded and acquired in the &s;pace of a month or &s;ix weeks, when I ble&s;&s;ed the Lord that I was &s;o rich. As we &s;ailed to different i&s;lands, I laid this money out in various things occa&s;ionally, and it u&s;ed to turn to very good account, e&s;pecially when we went to Guadaloupe, Grenada, and the re&s;t of the French i&s;lands. Thus was I going all about the i&s;lands upwards of four years, and ever trading as I went, during which I experienced many in&s;tances of ill u&s;age, and have &s;een many injuries done to other negroes in our dealings with whites: and, amid&s;t our recreations, when we have been dancing and merry-making, they, without cau&s;e, have mole&s;ted and in|&s;ulted us. Indeed I was more than once obliged to look up to God on high, as I had advi&s;ed the poor fi&s;her|man &s;ome time before. And I had not
<PB N="237" REF="260">
been long trading for my&s;elf in the manner I have related above, when I experienced the like trial in company with him as follows: This man being u&s;ed to the water, was upon an emer|gency put on board of us by his ma&s;ter to work as another hand, on a voyage to Santa Cruz; and at our &s;ailing he had brought his little all for a venture which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix bits' worth of limes and oranges in a bag; I had al&s;o my whole &s;tock, which was about twelve bits' worth of the &s;ame kind of goods, &s;eparate in two bags; for we had heard the&s;e fruits &s;old well in that i&s;land. When we came there, in &s;ome little convenient time he and I went a&s;hore with our fruits to &s;ell them; but we had &s;carcely landed when we were met by two white men, who pre&s;ently took our three bags from us. We could not at fir&s;t gue&s;s what they meant to do; and for &s;ome time we thought
<PB N="238" REF="261">
they were je&s;ting with us; but they too &s;oon let us know otherwi&s;e, for they took our ventures immediately to a hou&s;e hard by, and adjoining the fort, while we followed all the way begging of them to give us our fruits, but in vain. They not only refu&s;ed to return them but &s;wore at us, and threatened if we did not immediately depart they would flog us well. We told them the&s;e three bags were all we were worth in the world, and that we brought them with us to &s;ell when we came from Mont|&s;errat, and &s;hewed them the ve&s;&s;el. But this was rather again&s;t us, as they now &s;aw we were &s;trangers as well as &s;laves. They &s;till therefore &s;wore, and de&s;ired us to be gone, and even took &s;ticks to beat us; while we, &s;eeing they meant what they &s;aid, went off in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion and de&s;pair. Thus, in the very minute of gaining more by three times than I ever did
<PB N="239" REF="262">
by any venture in my life before, was I deprived of every farthing I was worth. An in&s;upportable misfortune! but how to help our&s;elves we knew not. In our con&s;ternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort, and told him how we had been &s;erved by &s;ome of his people; but we obtained not the lea&s;t redre&s;s: he an&s;wered our complaints only by a volley of impre|cations again&s;t us, and immediately took a hor&s;e-whip, in order to cha&s;ti&s;e us, &s;o that we were obliged to turn out much fa&s;ter than we came in. I now, in the agony of di&s;tre&s;s and indig|nation, wi&s;hed that the ire of God in his forked lightning might trans&s;ix the&s;e cruel oppre&s;&s;ors among the dead. Still however we per&s;evered; went back again to the hou&s;e, and begged and be|&s;ought them again and again for our fruits, till at la&s;t &s;ome other people that were in the hou&s;e a&s;ked if we would be
<PB N="240" REF="263">
contented if they kept one bag and gave us the other two. We, &s;eeing no remedy whatever, con&s;ented to this; and they, ob&s;erving one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it, which be|longed to my companion, kept that; and the other two, which were mine they gave us back. As &s;oon as I got them, I ran as fa&s;t as I could, and got the fir&s;t negro man I could to help me off; my companion, however, &s;tay|ed a little longer to plead; he told them the bag they had was his, and likewi&s;e all that he was worth in the world; but this was of no avail, and he was obliged to return without it. The poor old man wringing his hands, cri|ed bitterly for his lo&s;s; and, indeed, he then did look up to God on high, which &s;o moved me with pity for him, that I gave him nearly one third of my fruits. We then proceeded to the markets to &s;ell them; and Providence
<PB N="241" REF="264">
was more favourable to us than we could have expected, for we &s;old our fruits uncommonly well; I got for mine about thirty-&s;even bits. Such a &s;ur|pri&s;ing rever&s;e of fortune in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time &s;eemed like a dream, and proved no &s;mall encouragement for me to tru&s;t the Lord in any &s;itua|tion. My captain afterwards fre|quently u&s;ed to take my part, and get me my right, when I have been plun|dered or u&s;ed ill by the&s;e tender Chri&s;|tian depredators; among whom I have &s;huddered to ob&s;erve the uncea&s;ing bla&s;phemous execrations which are wan|t only thrown out by per&s;ons of all ages and conditions, not only without oc|ca&s;ion, but even as if they were indul|gences and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>At one of our trips to St. Kitt's, I had eleven bits of my own; and my friendly captain lent me five more,
<PB N="242" REF="265">
with which I bought a Bible. I was very glad to get this book, which I fcarcely could meet with any where. I think there was none &s;old in Mont|&s;errat; and, much to my grief, from being forced out of the Aetna in the manner I have related, my Bible, and the Guide to the Indians, the two books I loved above all others, were left behind.</P>
<P>While I was in this place, St. Kitt's, a very curious impo&s;ition on human nature took place:&mdash;A white man wanted to marry in the church a free black woman that had land and &s;laves in Mont&s;errat: but the clergyman told him it was again&s;t the law of the place to marry a white and a black in the church. The man then a&s;ked to be married on the water, to which the par&s;on con&s;ented, and the two lovers went in one boat, and the par&s;on and
<PB N="243" REF="266">
clerk in another, and thus the cere|mony was performed. After this the loving pair came on board our ve&s;&s;el, and my captain treated them extreme|ly well, and brought them &s;afe to Mont&s;errat.</P>
<P>The reader cannot but judge of the irk&s;omene&s;s of this &s;ituation to a mind like mine, in being daily expo&s;ed to new hard&s;hips and impo&s;itions, after having &s;een many better days, and been as it were, in a &s;tate of free|dom and plenty; added to which, every part of the world I had hitherto been in, &s;eemed to me a paradi&s;e in compari&s;on of the We&s;t Indies. My mind was therefore hourly replete with inventions and thoughts of being freed, and, if po&s;&s;ible, by hone&s;t and honour|able means; for I always remembered the old adage; and I tru&s;t it has ever been my ruling principle, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ho|ne&s;ty

is the be&s;t policy;"</Q> and likewi&s;e that other golden precept&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To do unto all men as I would they &s;hould do unto me."</Q> However, as I was from early years a prede&s;tinarian, I thought whatever fate had determined mu&s;t ever come to pa&s;s; and there|fore, if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing could prevent me, although I &s;hould at pre&s;ent &s;ee no means or hope to obtain my freedom; on the other hand, if it were my fate not to be freed I never &s;hould be &s;o, and all my en|deavours for that purpo&s;e would be fruitle&s;s. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e thoughts I therefore looked up with prayers anxiou&s;ly to God for my liberty; and at the &s;ame time u&s;ed every hone&s;t means, and did all that was po&s;&s;ible on my part to obtain it. In proce&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> time I became ma&s;ter of a few pound<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> and in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> way of making more, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">

my friendly captain knew very well; this occa&s;ioned him &s;ometimes to take liberties with me; but whenever he treated me wa&s;pi&s;hly I u&s;ed plainly to tell him my mind, and that I would die before I would be impo&s;ed upon as other negroes were, and that to me life had lo&s;t its reli&s;h when liberty was gone. This I &s;aid although I fore&s;aw my then well-being or future hopes of freedom (humanly &s;peaking) depended on this man. However, as he could not bear the thoughts of my not failing with him, he always became mild on my threats. I therefore continued with him; and, from my great attention to his orders and his bu&s;ine&s;s, I gained him credit, and through his kindne&s;s to me I at la&s;t procured my liberty. While I thus went on, filled with the thoughts of freedom, and re&s;i&s;ting oppre&s;&s;ion as well as I was able, my life hung daily

in &s;u&s;pence, particularly in the &s;urfs I have formerly mentioned, as I could not &s;wim. The&s;e are extremely violent throughout the We&s;t Indies, and I was ever expo&s;ed to their howling rage and devouring fury in all the i&s;lands. I have &s;een them &s;trike and to&s;s a boat right up an end, and maim &s;everal on board. Once in the Grenada i&s;lands, when I and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two pun|cheons of water in it, a &s;urf &s;truck us, and drove the boat and all in it about half a &s;tone's throw, among &s;ome trees, and above the high water mark. We were obliged to get all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we could from the neare&s;t e&s;tate to mend the boat, and launch it into the water again. At Mont&s;errat one night, in pre&s;&s;ing hard to get off the &s;hore on board, the punt was over&s;et with us four times; the fir&s;t time I was very near being drowned;
<PB N="247" REF="270">
however the jacket I had on kept me up above water a little &s;pace of time, while I called on a man near me who was a good &s;wimmer, and told him I could not &s;wim; he then made ha&s;te to me, and, ju&s;t as I was &s;inking, he caught hold of me, and brought me to &s;ounding, and then he went and brought the punt al&s;o. As &s;oon as we had turned the water out of her, le&s;t we &s;hould be u&s;ed ill for being ab&s;ent, we attempted again three times more, and as often the horrid &s;urfs &s;erved us as at fir&s;t; but at la&s;t, the fifth time we attempted, we gained our point, at the eminent hazard of our lives. One day al&s;o, at Old Road in Mont|&s;errat, our captain, and three men be|&s;ides my&s;elf, were going in a large canoe in que&s;t of rum and &s;ugar, when a &s;ingle &s;urf to&s;&s;ed the canoe an amazing di&s;tance from the water,

and &s;ome of us, near a &s;tone's throw from each other: mo&s;t of us were very much brui&s;ed; &s;o that I and many more often &s;aid, and really thought, that there was not &s;uch another place under the heavens as this. I longed therefore much to leave it, and daily wi&s;hed to &s;ee my ma&s;ter's promi&s;e per|formed of going to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>While we lay in this place a very cruel thing happened on board of our &s;loop which filled me with horror; though I found afterwards &s;uch practices were frequent. There was a very clever and decent free young mulatto-man who &s;ailed a long time with us: he had a free woman for his wife, by whom he had a child; and &s;he was then living on &s;hore, and all very happy. Our captain and mate, and other people on board, and &s;everal el&s;ewhere, even the natives of Bermudas, all knew this
<PB N="249" REF="272">
young man from a child that he was always free, and no one had ever claimed him as their property: how|ever, as might too often overcomes right in the&s;e parts, it happened that a Bermudas captain, who&s;e ve&s;&s;el lay there for a few days in the road, came on board of us, and &s;eeing the mulatto|man, who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph Clip&s;on, he told him he was not free, and that he had orders from his ma&s;ter to bring him to Bermudas. The poor man could not believe the captain to be in earne&s;t; but he was very &s;oon unde|ceived, his men laying violent hands on him; and although he &s;hewed a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">+ficate of his being born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> Kitt's, and mo&s;t people on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> that he &s;erved his time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">+ing, and always pa&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> yet he was forcibly taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> ve&s;&s;el.

a&s;hore before the &s;ecretary or magi&s;|trates, and the&s;e infernal invaders of human rights promi&s;ed him he &s;hould; but, in&s;tead of that, they carried him on board of the other ve&s;&s;el: and the next day, without giving the poor man any hearing on &s;hore, or &s;uffering him even to &s;ee his wife or child, he was earried away, and probably doomed never more in this world to &s;ee them again. Nor was this the only in&s;tance of this kind of barbarity I was a wit|ne&s;s to. I have &s;ince often &s;een in Jamaica and other i&s;lands, free men, whom I have known in America, thus villainou&s;ly trepanned and held in bon|dage. I have heard of two &s;imilar prac|tices even in Philadelphia: and were it not for the benevolence of the quak|ers in that city, many of the &s;able race, who now breathe the air of liberty, would, I believe, be groaning indeed

under &s;ome planter's chains. The&s;e things opened my mind to a new &s;eene of horror to which I had been before a &s;tranger. Hitherto I had thought only &s;lavery dreadful; but the &s;tate of a free negro appeared to me now equally &s;o at lea&s;t, and in &s;ome re&s;pects even wor&s;e, for they live in con&s;tant alarm for their liberty; which is but nomi|nal, for they are univer&s;ally in&s;ult|ed and plundered without the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of redre&s;s; for &s;uch is the equity of the We&s;t Indian laws, that no &s;ree negro's evidence will be admitted in their courts of ju&s;tice. In this &s;ituation is it &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;laves, when mildly treated, &s;hould prefer even the mi&s;ery of &s;lavery to &s;uch a mockery of &s;ree|dom? I was now completely di&s;gu&s;ted with the We&s;t Indies, and thought I never &s;hould be entirely free until I had left them.</P>

<P>I determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom, and to return to Old England. For this purpo&s;e I thought a knowledge of navigation might be of u&s;e to me; for, though I did not intend to run away unle&s;s I &s;hould be ill u&s;ed; yet, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, if I under&s;tood navigation, I might attempt my e&s;cape in our &s;loop, which was one of the &s;wifte&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t Indies, and I could be at no lo&s;s for hands to join me: and if I &s;hould make this attempt, I had in|tended to have gone for England; but this, as I &s;aid, was only to be in the event of my meeting with any ill u&s;age. I
<PB N="253" REF="276">
therefore employed the mate of our ve&s;|&s;el to teach me navigation, for which I agreed to give him twenty-four dollars, and actually paid him part of the money down; though when the captain, &s;ome time after, came to know that the mate was to have &s;uch a &s;um for teaching me, he rebuked him, and &s;aid it was a &s;hame for him to take any money from me. However, my progre&s;s in this u&s;eful art was much retarded by the con&s;tancy of our work. Had I wi&s;hed to run away I did not want op|portunities, which frequently pre&s;ented them&s;elves; and particularly at one time, &s;oon after this. When we were at the i&s;land of Gaurdeloupe there was a large fleet of merchantmen bound for Old France; and, &s;eamen then be+ing very &s;carce, they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for the run. Our mate, and all the white &s;ailors,
<PB N="254" REF="277">
left our ve&s;&s;el on this account, and went on board of the French &s;hips. They would have had me al&s;o to go with them, for they regarded me; and &s;wore to protect me, if I would go: and, as the fleet was to &s;ail the next day, I really believe I could have got &s;afe to Europe at that time. How|ever, as my ma&s;ter was kind, I would not attempt to leave him; &s;till re|membering the old maxim, that <Q REND="inline">'ho|ne&s;ty is the be&s;t policy,'</Q> I &s;uffered them to go without me. Indeed my captain was much afraid of my leaving him and the ve&s;&s;el at that time, as I had &s;o fair an opportunity: but, I thank God, this fidelity of mine turned out much to my advantage hereafter, when I did not in the lea&s;t think of it; and made me &s;o much in favour with the captain, that he u&s;ed now and then to teach me &s;ome parts of navigation
<PB N="255" REF="278">
him&s;elf; but &s;ome of our pa&s;&s;engers, and others, &s;eeing this, found much fault with him for it, &s;aying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation; thus I was hindered again in my pur&s;uits. About the lat|ter end of the year 1764, my ma&s;ter bought a larger &s;loop, called the Pru|dence, about &s;eventy or eighty tons, of which my captain had the com|mand. I went with him into this ve&s;|&s;el, and we took a load of new &s;laves for Georgia and Charles Town. My ma&s;ter now left me entirely to the captain, though he &s;till wi&s;hed for me to be with him; but I, who always much wi&s;hed to lo&s;e &s;ight of the We&s;t Indies, was not a little rejoiced at the thoughts of &s;eeing any other country. Therefore, relying on the goodne&s;s of my captain, I got ready all the little venture I could; and, when the ve&s;&s;el
<PB N="256" REF="279">
was ready, we &s;ailed to my great joy. When we got to our de&s;tined places, Georgia and Charles Town, I expect|ed I &s;hould have an opportunity of &s;elling my little property to advantage: but here, particularly in Charles Town, I met with buyers, white men, who impo&s;ed on me as in other places. Notwith&s;tanding, I was re&s;olved to have fortitude; thinking no lot or trial too hard when kind Heaven is the rewarder.</P>
<P>We &s;oon got loaded again, and returned to Mont&s;errat; and there, among&s;t the re&s;t of the i&s;lands, I &s;old my goods well; and in this manner I continued trading during the year 1764; meeting with various &s;cenes of impo|&s;ition, as u&s;ual. After this, my ma&s;ter fitted out his ve&s;&s;el for Philadelphia, in the year 1765; and during the time we were loading her, and getting
<PB N="257" REF="280">
ready for the voyage, I worked with redoubled alacrity, from the hope of getting money enough by the&s;e voyages to buy my freedom, in time, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God; and al&s;o to &s;ee the town of Philadelphia, which I had heard a great deal about for &s;ome years pa&s;t; be&s;ides which, I had always longed to prove my ma&s;ter's promi&s;e the fir&s;t day I came to him. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e elevated ideas, and while I was about getting my little merchandize in readine&s;s, one Sunday my ma&s;ter &s;ent for me to his hou&s;e. When I came there I found him and the cap|tain together; and, on my going in, I was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at his telling me he heard that I meant to run away from him when I got to Phila|delphia: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'And therefore,'</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I mu&s;t &s;ell you again: you co&s;t me a great deal of money, no le&s;s than
<PB N="258" REF="281">
forty pounds &s;terling; and it will not do to lo&s;e &s;o much. You are a valuable fellow,'</Q> continued he; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'and I can get any day for you one hun|dred guineas, from many gentlemen in this i&s;land.'</Q> And then he told me of Captain Doran's brother-in-law, a &s;evere ma&s;ter, who ever wanted to buy me to make me his over&s;eer. My captain al&s;o &s;aid he could get much more than a hundred guineas for me in Carolina. This I knew to be a fact; for the gentleman that wanted to buy me came off &s;everal times on board of us, and &s;poke to me to live with him, and &s;aid he would u&s;e me well. When I a&s;ked what work he would put me to, he &s;aid, as I was a &s;ailor, he would make me a captain of one of his rice ve&s;&s;els. But I refu&s;ed: and fearing at the &s;ame time, by a &s;udden turn I &s;aw in the captain's temper, he might
<PB N="259" REF="282">
mean to &s;ell me, I told the gentleman I would not live with him on any con|dition, and that I certainly would run away with his ve&s;&s;el: but he &s;aid he did not fear that, as he would catch him again; and then he told me how cruelly he would &s;erve me if I &s;hould do &s;o. My captain, however, gave him to under&s;tand that I knew &s;ome|thing of navigation: &s;o he thought better of it; and, to my great joy, he went away. I now told my ma&s;ter I did not &s;ay I would run away in Phi|ladelphia; neither did I mean it, as he did not u&s;e me ill, nor yet the captain: for if they did I certainly would have made &s;ome attempts before now; but as I thought that if it were God's will I ever &s;hould be freed it would be &s;o, and, on the contrary, if it was not his will it would not happen; &s;o I hoped if ever I were freed, whil&s;t I was u&s;ed
<PB N="260" REF="283">
well, it &s;hould be by hone&s;t means; but as I could not help my&s;elf, he mu&s;t do as he plea&s;ed; I could only hope and tru&s;t to the God of Heaven; and at that in&s;tant my mind was big with inventions and full of &s;chemes to e&s;cape. I then appealed to the cap|tain whether he ever &s;aw any &s;ign of my making the lea&s;t attempt to run away; and a&s;ked him if I did not al|ways come on board according to the time for which he gave me liberty; and, more particularly, when all our men left us at Gaurdeloupe and went on board of the French fleet, and ad|vi&s;ed me to go with them, whether I might not, and that he could not have got me again. To my no &s;mall &s;ur|pri&s;e, and very great joy, the captain confirmed every &s;yllable that I had &s;aid: and even more: for he &s;aid he had tried different times to &s;ee if I
<PB N="261" REF="284">
would make any attempt of this kind, both at St. Eu&s;tatia and in America, and he never found that I made the &s;malle&s;t; but on the contrary, I al|ways came on board according to his orders; and he did really believe, if I ever meant to run away, that, as I could never have had a better opportu|nity, I would have done it the night the mate and all the people left our ve&s;&s;el at Gaurdeloupe. The captain then in&s;ormed my ma&s;ter, who had been thus impo&s;ed on by our mate, (though I did not know who was my ememy,) the rea&s;on the mate had for impo&s;ing this lie upon him; which was, becau&s;e I had acquainted the cap|tain of the provi&s;ions the mate had given away or taken out of the ve&s;&s;el. This &s;peech of the captain was like life to the dead to me, and in&s;tantly my &s;oul glorified God; and &s;till more &s;o
<PB N="262" REF="285">
on hearing my ma&s;ter immediately &s;ay that I was a &s;en&s;ible fellow, and he ne|ver did intend to u&s;e me as a common &s;lave; and that but for the entreaties of the captain, and his character of me, he would not have let me go from the &s;tores about as I had done: that al&s;o, in &s;o doing, he thought by carrying one little thing or other to different places to &s;ell I might make money. That he al&s;o intended to encourage me in this, by crediting me with half a puncheon of rum and half a hog&s;head of &s;ugar at a time; &s;o that, from being careful, I might have money enough, in &s;ome time, to purcha&s;e my freedom; and, when that was the ca&s;e, I might depend upon it he would let me have it for forty pounds &s;terling money, which was only the &s;ame price he gave for me. This &s;ound gladdened my poor heart beyond mea&s;ure; though
<PB N="263" REF="286">
indeed it was no more than the very idea I had formed in my mind of my ma&s;ter long before, and I immediately made him this reply: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, I always had that very thought of you, indeed I had, and that made me &s;o diligent in &s;erving you.'</Q> He then gave me a large piece of &s;ilver coin, &s;uch as I never had &s;een or had before, and told me to get ready for the voyage, and he would credit me with a tierce of &s;ugar, and another of rum; he al&s;o &s;aid that he had two amiable &s;i&s;ters in Philadelphia, from whom I might get &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary things. Upon this my noble captain de&s;ired me to go aboard; and, knowing the African metal, he charged me not to &s;ay any thing of this matter to any body; and he pro|mi&s;ed that the lying mate &s;hould not go with him any more. This was a change indeed; in the &s;ame hour to
<PB N="264" REF="287">
feel the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain, and in the turn of a moment the fulle&s;t joy. It cau&s;ed in me &s;uch &s;en&s;ations as I was only able to expre&s;s in my looks; my heart was &s;o overpowered with gra|titude that I could have ki&s;&s;ed both of their feet. When I left the room I im|mediately went, or rather flew, to the ve&s;&s;el, which being loaded, my ma&s;ter, as good as his word, tru&s;ted me with a tierce of rum, and another of &s;ugar, when we &s;ailed, and arrived &s;afe at the elegant town of Philadelphia. I &s;oon &s;old my goods here pretty well; and in this charming place I found every thing plentiful and cheap.</P>
<P>While I was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befell me. I had been told one evening of a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> woman, a Mrs. Davis, who revealed &s;e|crets, foretold events, &amp;c. I put littie faith in this &s;tory at fir&s;t, as I could
<PB N="265" REF="288">
not conceive that any mortal could fore&s;ee the future di&s;po&s;als of Pro|vidence, nor did I believe in any other revelation than that of the Holy Scrip|tures; however, I was greatly a&s;toni&s;h|ed at &s;eeing this woman in a dream that night, though a per&s;on I never before beheld in my life; this made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on me, that I could not get the idea the next day out of my mind, and I then became as anxious to &s;ee her as I was before indifferent; ac|cordingly in the evening, after we left off working, I inquired where &s;he lived, and being directed to her, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e, beheld the very woman in the very &s;ame dre&s;s &s;he ap|peared to me to wear in the vi&s;ion. She immediately told me I had dream|ed of her the preceding night; related to me many things that had happened
<PB N="266" REF="289">
with a correctne&s;s that a&s;toni&s;hed me; and finally told me I &s;hould not be long a &s;lave: this was the more agree|able news, as I believed it the more readily from her having &s;o faithfully related the pa&s;t incidents of my life. She &s;aid I &s;hould be twice in very great danger of my life within eigh|teen months, which, if I e&s;caped, I &s;hould afterwards go on well; &s;o giv|ing me her ble&s;&s;ing, we parted.

make our voyages as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible; and from thus overworking my&s;elf while we were at Georgia I caught a fever and ague. I was very ill for eleven days and near dying; eternity was now exceedingly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, and I feared very much that awful event. I prayed the Lord there|fore to &s;pare me; and I made a pro|mi&s;e in my mind to God, that I would be good if ever I &s;hould recover. At length, from having an eminent doc|tor to attend me, I was re&s;tored again to health; and &s;oon after we got the ve&s;&s;el loaded, and &s;et off for Mont|&s;errat. During the pa&s;&s;age, as I was perfectly re&s;tored, and had much bu|&s;ine&s;s of the ve&s;&s;el to mind, all my en|deavours to keep up my integrity, and perform my promi&s;e to God, began to fail; and, in &s;pite of all I could do, as we drew nearer and nearer to the

i&s;lands, my re&s;olutions more and more declined, as if the very air of that country or climate &s;eemed fatal to piety. When we were &s;afe arrived at Mont&s;errat, and I had got a&s;hore, I for|got my former re&s;olutions.&mdash;Alas! how prone is the heart to leave that God it wi&s;hes to love! and how &s;trongly do the things of this world &s;trike the &s;en&s;es and captivate the &s;oul!&mdash;After our ve&s;|&s;el was di&s;charged, we &s;oon got her rea|dy, and took in, as u&s;ual, &s;ome of the poor oppre&s;&s;ed natives of Africa, and other negroes; we then &s;et off again for Georgia and Charle&s;town. We arriv|ed at Georgia, and, having landed part of our cargo, proceeded to Charle&s;|town with the remainder. While we were there I &s;aw the town illuminated; the guns were fired, and bonfires and other demon&s;trations of joy &s;hewn, on account of the repeal of the &s;tamp

act. Here I di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome goods on my own account; the white men buying them with &s;mooth promi&s;es and fair words, giving me, however, but very indifferent payment. There was one gentleman particularly who bought a puncheon of rum of me, which gave me a great deal of trouble; and, although I u&s;ed the intere&s;t of my friendly captain, I could not obtain any thing for it; for, being a negro man, I could not oblige him to pay me. This vexed me much, not knowing how to act; and I lo&s;t &s;ome time in &s;eeking after this Chri&s;tian; and though, when the Sabbath came (which the negroes u&s;ually make their holiday) I was much inclined to go to public wor&s;hip, I was obliged to hire &s;ome black men to help to pull a boat acro&s;s the water to go in que&s;t of this gentleman. When I found him, after much entreaty, both

from my&s;elf and my worthy captain, he at la&s;t paid me in dollars; &s;ome of them, however, were copper, and of con&s;equence of no value; but he took advantage of my being a negro man, and obliged me to put up with tho&s;e or none, although I objected to them. Immediately after, as I was trying to pa&s;s them in the market, among&s;t other white men, I was abu&s;ed for of|fering to pa&s;s bad coin; and, though I &s;hewed them the man I got them from, I was within one minute of being tied up and flogged without either judge or jury; however, by the help of a good pair of heels, I ran off, and &s;o e&s;caped the ba&s;tinadoes I &s;hould have received. I got on board as fa&s;t as I could, but &s;till continued in fear of them until we &s;ailed, which I thanked God we did not long after; and I have never been among&s;t them &s;ince.</P>

We &s;oon came to Georgia, where we were to complete our lading; and here wor&s;e fate than ever attended me: for one Sunday night, as I was with &s;ome negroes in their ma&s;ter's yard in the town of Savannah, it happened that their ma&s;ter, one Doctor Perkins, who was a very &s;evere and cruel man, came in drunk; and not liking to &s;ee any &s;trange negroes in his yard, he and a ruffian of a white man, he had in his &s;ervice, be&s;et me in an in&s;tant, and both of them &s;truck me with the fir&s;t wea|pons they could get hold of. I cried out as long as I could for help and mercy; but, though I gave a good account of my&s;elf, and he knew my captain, who lodged hard by him, it was to no purpo&s;e. They beat and mangled me in a &s;hameful manner, leaving me near dead. I lo&s;t &s;o much blood from the wounds I received,
<PB N="272" REF="295">
that I lay quite motionle&s;s, and was &s;o benumbed that I could not feel any thing for many hours. Early in the morning they took me away to the jail. As I did not return to the &s;hip all night, my captain, not knowing where I was, and being unea&s;y that I did not then make my appearance, he made inquiry after me; and, having found where I was, immediately came to me. As &s;oon as the good man &s;aw me &s;o cut and mangled, he could not forbear weeping; he &s;oon got me out of jail to his lodgings, and immedi|ately &s;ent for the be&s;t doctors in the place, who at fir&s;t declared it as their opinion that I could not recover. My captain on this went to all the lawyers in the town for their advice, but they told him they could do nothing for me as I was a negro. He then went to Doctor Perkins, the hero who had van|qui&s;hed
<PB N="273" REF="296">
me, and menaced him, &s;wear|ing he would be revenged of him, and challenged him to fight.&mdash;But cowardice is ever the companion of cruelty&mdash;and the Doctor refu&s;ed. How|ever, by the &s;kilfulne&s;s of one Doctor Brady of that place, I began at la&s;t to amend; but, although I was &s;o &s;ore and bad with the wounds I had all over me that I could not re&s;t in any po&s;ture, yet I was in more pain on account of the captain's unea&s;ine&s;s about me than I otherwi&s;e &s;hould have been. The worthy man nur&s;ed and watched me all the hours of the night; and I was, through his attention and that of the doctor, able to get out of bed in about &s;ixteen or eighteen days. All this time I was very much wanted on board, as I u&s;ed frequently to go up and down the river for rafts, and other parts of our cargo, and &s;tow them,
<PB N="274" REF="297">
when the mate was &s;ick or ab&s;ent. In about four weeks I was able to go on duty; and in a fortnight after, having got in all our lading, our ve&s;&s;el &s;et &s;ail for Mont&s;errat; and in le&s;s than three weeks we arrived there &s;afe towards the end of the year. This ended my adventures in 1764; for I did not leave Mont&s;errat again till the beginning of the following year.</P>
