<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON.</HEAD>
<P>THE general &s;en&s;e of mankind, and the practice of the learned in all ages, have given a &s;anction to biographical hi&s;tory, and concurred to recommend that precept of the wi&s;e &s;on of Sirach, in which we are exhorted to <Q REND="inline">'prai&s;e famous men, &s;uch as by their coun&s;els and by their knowledge of learning were meet for the people,&mdash;and were wi&s;e and eloquent in their in|&s;tructions,&mdash;and &s;uch as recited ver&s;es in writing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecclus. Chap. XLIV. Ver&s;e 1, et &s;eqq.</NOTE>.'</Q> In each of the&s;e faculties did the per&s;on, who&s;e hi&s;tory I am about to write, &s;o greatly excel, that, except for my pre&s;umption in the attempt to di&s;play his worth, the undertaking may be thought to need no apology; e&s;pe|cially if we contemplate, together with his mental endow|ments, tho&s;e moral qualities which di&s;tingui&s;hed him, and reflect that, in an age when literary acqui&s;itions and
<PB N="2" REF="3">
&s;cientific improvements are rated at their utmo&s;t value, he re&s;ted not in the applau&s;e which the&s;e pro|cured him; but adorned the character of a &s;cholar and a philo&s;opher with that of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tified, as I tru&s;t, thus far in the opinion of the reader, I may, neverthele&s;s, &s;tand in need of his ex|cu&s;e; for that, in the narration of facts that re&s;pect others, I have oftener &s;poke of my&s;elf, and in my own per&s;on, than the practice of &s;ome writers will war|rant. To this objection, if any &s;hall plea&s;e to make it, I an&s;wer, that the rever&s;e of wrong is not always right. By the office I have undertaken I &s;tand en|gaged to relate facts to which I was a witne&s;s, con|ver&s;ations in which I was a party, and to record me|morable &s;ayings uttered only to my&s;elf. Whoever attends to the&s;e circum&s;tances, mu&s;t, be&s;ides the di&s;gu&s;t which &s;uch an affectation of humility would excite, be convinced, that in &s;ome in&s;tances, the avoid|ing of egoti&s;ms had been extremely difficult, and in many impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>SAMUEL JOHNSON, the &s;ubject of the following memoirs, was the elder of the two &s;ons of Michael John&s;on, of the city of Lichfield book&s;eller, and of Sarah his wife, a &s;i&s;ter of Dr. Jo&s;eph Ford, a phy&s;ician of great eminence, and father of the famous Cornelius otherwi&s;e called Par&s;on Ford.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this per&s;on, who yet lives in the remembrance of a few of his a&s;&s;ociates, little can be related but from oral tradition. He was, as I have heard John&s;on &s;ay, a man of great wit and &s;tupendous parts, but of very profligate manners. He was chaplain to Lord Che&s;terfield during his re&s;idence at the Hague; but, as his lord&s;hip was u&s;ed to tell him, precluded all hope of preferment by the want of a vice, namely, hypocri&s;y. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that the par&s;on in Hogarth's modern midnight conver&s;ation, was intended to repre&s;ent him in his hour of fe&s;tivity, four in the morning.</NOTE> He was born, as I
<PB N="3" REF="4">
find it noted in his diary, on the &s;eventh day of Sep|tember, 1709: his brother, named Nathanael, was born &s;ome years after. Mr. John&s;on was a man of eminence in his trade, and of &s;uch reputation in the city abovementioned, that he, more than once, bore, for a year, the office of bailiff or chief magi&s;trate thereof, and di&s;charged the duties of that exalted &s;tation with honour and applau&s;e. It may here be proper, as it will account for &s;ome particulars re&s;pect|ing the character of his &s;on Samuel, to mention, that his political principles led him to favour the preten&s;i|ons of the exiled family, and that though a very hone&s;t and &s;en&s;ible man, he, like many others inhabiting the county of Stafford, was a Jacobite.</P>
<P>It may farther be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome amiable qualities either moral or per&s;onal, from a circum&s;tance in his early life, of which evidence is yet remaining. While he was an apprentice at Leek in Stafford&s;hire, a young woman of the &s;ame town fell in love with him, and upon his removal to Lichfield fol|lowed him, and took lodgings oppo&s;ite his hou&s;e. Her pa&s;&s;ion was not unknown to Mr. John&s;on, but he had no inclination to return it, till he heard that it &s;o affect|ed her mind that her life was in danger, when he vi&s;ited her, and made her a tender of his hand, but feeling the approach of death, &s;he declined it, and &s;hortly after died, and was interred in Lichfield cathedral. In pity
<PB N="4" REF="5">
to her &s;ufferings, Mr. John&s;on cau&s;ed a &s;tone to be placed over her grave with this in&s;cription:<Q>Here lies the body of <LB>Mrs. ELIZABETH BLANEY, a &s;tranger. <LB>She departed this life, <LB>2d of September, 1694.</Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t born child of Mr. John&s;on and his wife, their &s;on Samuel, had the misfortune to receive, toge|ther with its nutriment derived from a hired nur&s;e, the &s;eeds of that di&s;ea&s;e which troubled him through life, the &s;truma, or, as it is called, the king's-evil; for the cure whereof his mother, agreeable to the opinion then entertained of the efficacy of the royal touch, pre&s;ented him to Queen Anne, who, for the la&s;t time, as it is &s;aid, that &s;he ever performed that office, with her accu&s;tomed grace and benignity admini&s;tered to the child as much of that healing quality as it was in her power to di&s;pen&s;e, and hung about his neck the u&s;ual amulet of an angel of gold, with the impre&s;s of St. Michael the archangel on the one &s;ide, and a &s;hip under full &s;ail on the other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This healing gift is &s;aid to have been derived to our princes from Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, and is recorded by his hi&s;torian, Alured Rivallen&s;is. In Stow's annals we have a relation of the fir&s;t cure of this kind which Edward performed; but, as it is rather di&s;gu&s;ting to read it, I chu&s;e to give it in the words of the author from whence it is apparently taken, with this remark, that the kings of France lay claim to the &s;ame miraculous power. <Q REND="inline">'Adole&s;centula quaedam tradita nuptiis duplici laborabat incommodo.

<P>The reader will find much curious matter relating to the royal touch, in Mr. Barrington's ob&s;ervations on ancient &s;tatutes 107, and in Chambers's dictionary, art. EVIL, to which I &s;hall add, that the vindication of this power, as inherent in the pretender, by Mr. Carte, de&s;troyed the credit of his intended hi&s;tory of England, and put a &s;top to the completion of it.</P>
<P>The ritual for this is to be found in Bi&s;hop Sparrow's collection of articles, canons, &amp;c. and al&s;o in all or mo&s;t of the impre&s;&s;ions of the Common Prayer Book, printed in Queen Anne's reign, but in the&s;e latter with great variations.</P></NOTE> It was probably
<PB N="5" REF="6">
this-di&s;ea&s;e that deprived him of the &s;ight of his left eye, for he has been heard to &s;ay, that he never re|membered to have enjoyed the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
It may &s;eem a ridiculous attempt to trace the dawn of his poetical faculty &s;o far back as to his very in|fancy; but the following incident I am compelled to mention, as it is well atte&s;ted, and therefore makes part of his hi&s;tory. When he was about three years old, his mother had a brood of eleven ducklings, which &s;he permitted him to call his own. It hap|pened that in playing about he trod on and killed one of them, upon which running to his mother, he, in great emotion bid her write. Write, child? &s;aid &s;he, what mu&s;t I write? Why write, an&s;wered he, &s;o:
<Q>Here lies good Ma&s;ter Duck, <LB>That Samuel John&s;on trod on, <LB>If't had liv'd 'twould have been good luck, <LB>For then there'd been an odd one.</Q>
and &s;he wrote accordingly.</P>
<P>Being arrived at a proper age for grammatical in|&s;truction, he was placed in the free &s;chool of Lichfield, of which Mr. Hunter was then ma&s;ter. The progre&s;s he made in his learning &s;oon attracted the notice of his teachers; and among other di&s;cernible qualities that di&s;tingui&s;hed him from the re&s;t of the &s;chool, he was bold, active and enterpri&s;ing, &s;o that without affecting it, the &s;eniors in the &s;chool looked on him as their head and leader, and readily acquie&s;ced in whatever he propo&s;ed or did. There dwelt at Lichfield a gen|tleman of the name of Butt, the father of the reverend Mr. Butt, now a King's Chaplain, to who&s;e hou&s;e on holidays and in &s;chool-vacations he was ever welcome. The children in the family, perhaps offended with the rudene&s;s of his behaviour, would frequently call him the great boy, which the father once overhearing, &s;aid,

<PB N="7" REF="8"><Q REND="inline">'you call him the great boy, but take my word for it, he will one day prove a great man.'</Q></P>
<P>A more particular character of him while a &s;chool|boy, and of his behaviour at &s;chool, I find in a paper now before me, written by a per&s;on yet living, and of which the following is a copy:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'John&s;on and I were, early in life, &s;chool-fellows at Lichfield, and for many years in the &s;ame cla&s;s. As his uncommon abilities for learning far exceeded us, we endeavoured by every boyi&s;h piece of flattery to gain his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and three of us, by turns, u&s;ed to call on him in a morning, on one of who&s;e backs, &s;upported by the other two, he rode triumphantly to &s;chool. He never a&s;&s;ociated with us in any of our diver&s;ions, except in the winter when the ice was firm, to be drawn along by a boy bare-footed. His ambition to excel was great, though his application to books, as far as it appeared, was very trifling. I could not oblige him more than by &s;auntering away every vacation, that occurred, in the fields, during which time he was more engaged in talking to him|&s;elf than his companion. Ver&s;es or themes he would dictate to his favourites, but he would never be at the trouble of writing them. His di&s;like to bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o great, that he would procra&s;tinate his exer|ci&s;es to the la&s;t hour. I have known him after a long vacation, in which we were rather &s;everely ta&s;ked, return to &s;chool an hour earlier in the morn|ing, and begin one of his exerci&s;es, in which he pur|po&s;ely left &s;ome faults, in order to gain time to fini&s;h the re&s;t.</P><P>'I never knew him corrected at &s;chool, unle&s;s it was for talking and diverting other boys from their
<PB N="8" REF="9">
bu&s;ine&s;s, by which, perhaps, he might hope to keep his a&s;cendancy. He was uncommonly inqui&s;itive, and his memory &s;o tenacious, that whatever he read or heard he never forgot. I remember rehear&s;ing to him eighteen ver&s;es, which after a little pau&s;e he repeated verbatim, except one epithet, which im|proved the line.</P>
<P>'After a long ab&s;ence from Lichfield, when he re|turned I was apprehen&s;ive of &s;omething wrong in his con&s;titution, which might either impair his intellect or endanger his life, but, thanks to Almighty God, my fears have proved fal&s;e.'</P></Q></P>
<P>In the autumn of the year 1725, he received an invitation from his uncle, Cornelius Ford, to &s;pend a few days with him at his hou&s;e, which I conjecture to have been on a living of his in one of the counties bor|dering upon Stafford&s;hire; but it &s;eems that the uncle, di&s;covering that the boy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon parts, was unwilling to let him return, and to make up for the lo&s;s he might &s;u&s;tain by his ab&s;ence from &s;chool, became his in&s;tructor in the cla&s;&s;ics, and far|ther a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his &s;tudies; &s;o that it was not till the Whitfuntide following, that John&s;on went back to Lichfield. Whether Mr. Hunter was di&s;plea&s;ed to find a vi&s;it of a few days protracted into a vacation of many months, or that he re&s;ented the interference of another per&s;on in the tuition of one of his &s;cholars, and he one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing of any under his care, cannot now be known; but, it &s;eems, that at John&s;on's return to Lichfield, he was not received into the &s;chool of that city; on the contrary, I am in|formed, by a per&s;on who was his &s;chool-fellow there, that he was placed in one at Stourbridge in Worce&s;|ter&s;hire, under the care of a ma&s;ter named Winkworth,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
but who, affecting to be thought allied to the Strafford family, a&s;&s;umed the name of Wentworth.</P>
<P>When his &s;chool education was fini&s;hed, his father, who&s;e circum&s;tances were far from affluent, was for &s;ome time at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of him: he took him home, probably with a view to bring him up to his own trade; for I have heard John&s;on &s;ay, that he him&s;elf was able to bind a book. This &s;u&s;pen&s;e continued about two years, at the end whereof, a neighbouring gentleman, Mr. Andrew Corbet, hav|ing a &s;on, who had been educated in the &s;ame &s;chool with John&s;on, whom he was about to &s;end to Pem|broke college in Oxford, a propo&s;al was made and accepted, that John&s;on &s;hould attend this &s;on thither, in quality of a&s;&s;i&s;tant in his &s;tudies; and accordingly, on the 31&s;t day of October, 1728, they were both en|tered, Corbet as a gentleman-commoner, and John&s;on as a commoner.</P>
<P>The college tutor, at that time, was a man named Jordan, whom John&s;on, though he loved him for the goodne&s;s of his nature, &s;o contemned for the mean|ne&s;s of his abilities, that he would oftener ri&s;que the payment of a &s;mall fine than attend his lectures; nor was he &s;tudious to conceal the rea&s;on of his ab&s;ence. Upon occa&s;ion of one &s;uch impo&s;ition, he &s;aid to Jor|dan, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, you have &s;conced me two-pence for non|'attendance at a lecture not worth a penny.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether it was this di&s;couragement in the out&s;et of their &s;tudies, or any other ground of di&s;inclination that moved him to it, is not known, but this is certain, that young Corbet could not brook &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a man who &s;eemed to be little more learned than him&s;elf, and
<PB N="10" REF="11">
that having a father living, who was able to di&s;po&s;e of him in various other ways, he, after about two years &s;tay, left the college, and went home.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e of John&s;on was far different: his fortunes were at &s;ea; his title to a &s;tipend was gone, and all that he could obtain from the father of Mr. Corbet, was, an agreement, during his continuance at college, to pay for his commons. With no exhibition, or other means of &s;upport in the pro&s;ecution of his &s;tudies, he had no|thing to depend on, &s;ave the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a kind and indulgent parent. At that time the trade of a country book&s;eller, even in a city where was a cathedral and an incorporation of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, was le&s;s profitable than it is now; for though it may be &s;aid, that during the reign of Queen Anne, multitudes of controver&s;ial books and pamphlets were publi&s;hing, yet the&s;e yield|ed but &s;mall advantage to the mere venders of them: there were then no &s;uch publications for the mere amu&s;ement of young readers or idle per&s;ons as the pre&s;s now daily &s;ends forth; nor had any book&s;eller entertained in his mind the project of a circulating library: from hence it is evident, that his father, hav|ing no other means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting him&s;elf and his chil|dren, than the ordinary income of his &s;hop, was but little able to afford him any other than a &s;canty main|tenance.</P>
<P>The want of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;cholars in gene|ral derive from their parents, relations, and friends, &s;oon became vi&s;ible in the garb and appearance of John&s;on, which, though in &s;ome degree concealed by a &s;cholar's gown, and that we know is never deemed the le&s;s honourable for being old, was &s;o apparent as to
<PB N="11" REF="12">
excite pity in &s;ome that &s;aw and noticed him. Shall I be particular, and relate a circum&s;tance of his di&s;tre&s;s, that cannot be imputed to him as an effect of his own extravagance or irregularity, and con&s;equently reflects no di&s;grace on his memory? He had &s;carce any change of raiment, and, in a &s;hort time after Corbet left him, but one pair of &s;hoes, and tho&s;e &s;o old, that his feet were &s;een through them: a gentleman of his college, the father of an eminent clergyman now living, directed a &s;ervitor one morning to place a new pair at the door of John&s;on's chamber, who, &s;eeing them upon his fir&s;t go|ing out, &s;o far forgot him&s;elf and the &s;pirit that mu&s;t have actuated his unknown benefactor, that, with all the indignation of an in&s;ulted man, he threw them away.</P>
<P>He may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been under the age of twenty, when this imaginary indignity was offered him, a period of life at which, &s;o far as concerns the know|ledge of mankind, and the means of improving adver&s;e circum&s;tances, every one has much to learn: he had, doubtle&s;s, before this time, experienced <Q REND="inline">'the proud man's contumely;'</Q> and in this &s;chool of affliction might have fir&s;t had rea&s;on to &s;ay,&mdash;
<Q><L>Slow ri&s;es worth by poverty depre&s;t.</L></Q>
his &s;pirit was, neverthele&s;s, too great to &s;ink under this depre&s;&s;ion. His tutor, Jordan, in about a year's &s;pace, went off to a living which he had been pre&s;ented to, upon giving a bond to re&s;ign it in favour of a mi|nor, and John&s;on became the pupil of Mr. Adams, a per&s;on of far &s;uperior endowments, who afterwards at|tained a doctor's degree, and is at this time head of his college. Encouraged, by a change &s;o propitious to his
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;tudies, he pro&s;ecuted them with diligence, attended both public and private lectures, performed his exer|ci&s;es with alacrity, and in &s;hort, neglected no means or opportunities of improvement. He had at this time a great emulation, to call it by no wor&s;e a name, to excel his competitors in literature. There was a young gentleman of his college, named Meekes, who&s;e exer|ci&s;es he could not bear to hear commended; and when|ever he declaimed or di&s;puted in the hall, John&s;on would retire to the farthe&s;t corner thereof, that he might be out of the reach of his voice.</P>
<P>In this cour&s;e of learning, his favourite objects were cla&s;&s;ical literature, ethics, and theology, in the latter whereof he laid the foundation by &s;tudying the Fa|thers. If we may judge from the magnitude of his Adver&s;aria, which I have now by me, his plan for &s;tudy was a very exten&s;ive one. The heads of &s;cience, to the extent of &s;ix folio volumes, are copiou&s;ly branched throughout it; but, as is generally the ca&s;e with young &s;tudents, the blank far exceed in number the written leaves.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies was far from regular: he read by fits and &s;tarts, and, in the intervals, dige&s;ted his reading by meditation, to which he was ever prone. Neither did he regard the hours of &s;tudy, farther than the di&s;cipline of the college com|pelled him. It was the practice in his time, for a &s;er|vitor, by order of the ma&s;ter, to go round to the rooms of the young men, and knocking at the door, to en|quire if they were within, and, if no an&s;wer was return|ed, to report them ab&s;ent: John&s;on could not endure this intru&s;ion, and would frequently be &s;ilent, when the utterance of a word would have in&s;ured him from cen|&s;ure;
<PB N="13" REF="14">
and, farther to be revenged for being di&s;turbed when he was as profitably employed as perhaps he could be, would join with others of the young men in the college in hunting, as they called it, the &s;ervitor, who was thus diligent in his duty; and this they did with the noi&s;e of pots and candle&s;ticks, &s;inging to the tune of Chevy-chace, the words in that old ballad,
<Q><L>To drive the deer with hound and horn, &amp;c.</L></Q>
not &s;eldom to the endangering the life and limbs of the unfortunate victim.</P>

1729, when, as appears by a note in his diary in the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">'1729 Dec. S. J. Oxonio rediir,'</Q> he left that place, the rea&s;on whereof, was a failure of pecuniary &s;upplies from his father; but meeting with another &s;ource, the bounty, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, of &s;ome one or more of the members of the cathedral, he returned, and made up the whole of his re&s;idence in the univer&s;ity, about three years, during all which time his academical &s;tudies, though not orderly, were to an a&s;toni&s;hing de|gree inten&s;e. Whoever has peru&s;ed Mr. Spence's life of Antonio Magliabechi, may di&s;cern a near re&s;emblance in their manner of reading, between that per&s;on and John&s;on: the former, &s;ays his author, <Q REND="inline">'&s;eems never to have applied him&s;elf to any particular &s;tudy. A pa&s;|&s;ion for reading was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and a prodi|gious memory his great talent: he read every book almo&s;t indifferently, as they happened to come into his hands: he read them with a &s;urpri&s;ing quick|ne&s;s, and yet retained, not only the &s;en&s;e of what he read, but, often, all the words and the very manner of &s;pelling them, if there was any thing peculiar of that kind in any author.'</Q></P>
<P>A like propen&s;ity to reading, and an equal celerity in the practice thereof, were ob&s;ervable in John&s;on: it was wonderful to &s;ee, when he took up a book, with what eagerne&s;s he peru&s;ed, and with what ha&s;te his eye, for it has been related, that he had the u&s;e of only one, travelled over it: he has been known to read a volume, and that not a &s;mall one, at a &s;itting; nor was he inferior in the power of memory to him with whom he is compared: whatever he read, became his own for ever, with all the advantages that a penetra|ting judgment and deep reflection could add to it.

have heard him repeat, with &s;carce a mi&s;take of a word, pa&s;&s;ages from favourite authors, of three or four octavo pages in length. One in&s;tance of the greatne&s;s of his retentive faculty him&s;elf has thought fit to give, in his life of the Earl of Roche&s;ter, where may be &s;een a Latin poem upon Nothing, written by Pa&s;&s;erat; for the infertion whereof he had, as it is &s;aid, no other aid than his own recollection. How far he approved that method of reading, which he is above &s;aid to have pur&s;ued, and what value he &s;et on the powers of me|mory, may be inferred from his character of the former of tho&s;e per&s;ons in his lives of the poets, of whom he thus &s;peaks:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'He was remarkable for the power of reading with great rapidity, and of retaining with great fidelity what he &s;o ea&s;ily collected.

<P>It is little le&s;s than certain, that his own indigence, and the inability of his father to help him, called John&s;on from the univer&s;ity &s;ooner than he meant to quit it: his father, either during his continuance there, or po&s;&s;ibly before, had been by misfortunes rendered in&s;olvent, if not, as John&s;on told me, an actual bank|rupt. The non-attainment of a degree, which after a certain &s;tanding is conferred almo&s;t of cour&s;e, he regretted not: it is true, he &s;oon felt the want of one; but ample amends were afterwards made him, by
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the voluntary grant of the highe&s;t academical honours that two of the mo&s;t learned &s;eminaries in Europe could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The advantages he derived from an univer&s;ity edu|cation, &s;mall as they may hitherto &s;eem, went a great way towards fixing, as well his moral as his literary character: the order and di&s;cipline of a college life, the reading the be&s;t authors, the attendance on public exerci&s;es, the early calls to prayer, the frequent in|&s;tructions from the pulpit, with all the other means of religious and moral improvement, had their proper effect; and though they left his natural temper much as they found it, they begat in his mind tho&s;e &s;enti|ments of piety which were the rule of his conduct throughout his future life, and made &s;o con&s;picuous a part of his character.</P>
<P>He could not, at this early period of his life, dive&s;t him&s;elf of an opinion, that poverty was di&s;graceful; and was very &s;evere in his cen&s;ures of that oeconomy in both our univer&s;ities, which exacted at meals the attendance of poor &s;cholars, under the &s;everal denomi|nations of &s;ervitors in the one, and &s;izers in the other: he thought that the &s;cholar's, like the chri&s;tian life, levelled all di&s;tinctions of rank and worldly pre-emi|nence; but in this he was mi&s;taken: civil policy had, long before his coming into the world, reduced the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of men to a regular &s;ubordination, and given &s;ervitude its &s;anction. The feudal &s;y&s;tem of government throughout Europe had &s;o arranged the &s;everal orders of &s;ubjects, that the lower were uni|formly dependent on the higher; and in the hi&s;tory of the peerage of our own country, we find the retinues of the higher nobility made up of the &s;ons and daugh|ters

<P>Upon his leaving the univer&s;ity, he went home to the hou&s;e of his father, which he found &s;o nearly filled with relations, that is to &s;ay, the maiden &s;i&s;ters of his mother and uncle Cornelius Ford, whom his father, on the decea&s;e of their brother in the &s;ummer of 1731, had taken in to board, that it would &s;carce receive him.</P>
<P>He brought with him a deep &s;en&s;e of religion, a due reverence for the national church, and a re&s;pect for its mini&s;ters; and the&s;e he retained, though he had been a witne&s;s to the profligacy of his uncle Ford, which was nearly enough to have effaced all &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions from a young mind. Having not then &s;een, as we now do, eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices adverti&s;ed for &s;ale, and con&s;i|dered by the purcha&s;ers as lay-fees; nor beheld many of the beneficed clergy abandoning the duties of the cle|rical function to the lowe&s;t of their order, them&s;elves becoming gentlemen at large, mixing in all public recreations and amu&s;ements<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">While this is the ca&s;e, there can be very little hope of mending the &s;ituation of the in&s;erior clergy.

In a word, were the gradations of the clergy to be multiplied, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential offices of their function would continue, as they now are, to be the employment of the lowe&s;t of them.</NOTE>, neglecting their &s;tudies

<P>As John&s;on's &s;tay at the univer&s;ity was not long enough for him to complete his &s;tudies, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that at his return to Lichfield, he devoted his time to the improvement of them, and that having no call from thence, he continued there till the death of his father, which, as he has noted it, was in the month of December, 1731.</P>
<P>Being thus bereft of the little &s;upport his father was able to afford him, and having, not only a profe&s;&s;ion, but the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to &s;eek, he, in the month of March 1732, accepted of an invitation to the office of under-ma&s;ter or u&s;her of a free grammar-&s;chool, at Market-Bo&s;worth in Leice&s;ter&s;hire, founded and endowed by Sir Wol&s;tan Dixie, lord mayor of Lon|don in 1586, the upper ma&s;ter whereof was the reve|rend Anthony Blackwall, the author of a well-known book on the &s;acred cla&s;&s;ics. The patron of this &s;emi|nary was Sir Wol&s;tan Dixie, baronet, a de&s;cendant of the original founder; and the endowment being very &s;mall, John&s;on's re&s;idence was in the man&s;ion-hou&s;e of Sir Wol&s;tan adjacent thereto; but the treatment he received from this per&s;on, who, in the pride of wealth, &s;hewed no regard for learning or parts, nor re&s;pected

any man for his mental endowments, was &s;uch that, preferring the chance of the wide world to his patro|nage, John&s;on, in the month of July, in the &s;ame year in which he went to Bo&s;worth, re&s;igned his office, and took leave of a place, which he could never after &s;peak of but in terms of the utmo&s;t di&s;like, and even of ab|horrence.</P>
<P>By the middle of June, in the year 1732, he was able to e&s;timate that &s;lender pittance which devolved to him upon the decea&s;e of his father; the amount whereof I find a&s;certained by a memorandum in his diary, which, as it is de&s;criptive of his circum&s;tances at the time, I here tran&s;late, and at the bottom of the page have in|&s;erted verbatim.</P>

<P>In the month of June in the following year, 1733, I find him re&s;ident in the hou&s;e of a per&s;on named Jarvis, at Birmingham, where, as he has noted in his diary, he rendered into Engli&s;h from the French, a voyage to Aby&s;&s;inia, which has &s;ince appeared to be that of Padre Jerome Lobo, a Portugue&s;e Je&s;uit, with
<PB N="22" REF="23">
the additions of Mon&s;. l'Abb&eacute; Le Grand, very curious and entertaining, of which the following is a character:</P>
<P>It contains a narration of the endeavours of a com|pany of mi&s;&s;ionaries of the author's country to unite the Aby&s;&s;ins to the church of Rome. It was tran&s;la|ted from the original Portugue&s;e into French by l'Abb&eacute; Le Grand, who, as Lobo had extended it no farther than his own concern in the mi&s;&s;ion, continued it down to the time when the Je&s;uits were finally driven out of Aethiopia, with the addition of fifteen di&s;&s;ertations on &s;ubjects relating to the hi&s;tory, antiquities, government, religion, manners, and natural hi&s;tory of Aby&s;&s;inia, and other countries mentioned by the original author.</P>
<P>The preface, which bears &s;tronger marks of John|&s;on's hand than any part of the work, is calculated to attract attention and credit: it commends the unaffect|ed &s;implicity of the original narrative, and the learn|ing of M. Le Grand; it acknowledges the omi&s;&s;ions and deviations which the tran&s;lator thought it prudent to make, and it apologizes for any defects that may be di&s;covered. John&s;on's di&s;qui&s;itive propen&s;ity ju&s;t dawns in an ob&s;ervation on the erroneous method of the Roman church, in making converts; but there is nothing &s;triking in the compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Were we to re&s;t our judgment on internal evidence, John&s;on's claim to the title of tran&s;lator of this work would be di&s;putable; it has &s;carce a feature re&s;embling him: the language is as &s;imple and unornamented as John Bunyan's; the &s;tyle is far from elegant, and &s;ometimes it is not even correct. The&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, together with frequent mi&s;takes and various orthography, would almo&s;t &s;tagger our belief, but
<PB N="23" REF="24">
that we have the authority of John&s;on him&s;elf to rely on, who often acknowledged it for his own.</P>
<P>As this voyage to Aby&s;&s;inia, notwith&s;tanding the country and manners it de&s;cribes are wonderful and intere&s;ting, has not been &s;o much noticed as John&s;on's later and original productions, it may not be thought impertinent to give the outline of the relation.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the &s;eventeenth century, the then reigning emperor of Aby&s;&s;inia, for con&s;idera|tions that favoured more of good policy than of religi|on, became a convert to the church of Rome: many of his &s;ubjects had followed his example; and the mi&s;&s;i|onaries already in the country were in want of co-ad|jutors to extend their progre&s;s. Padre Jerome Lobo, who was then employed in the Ea&s;t-Indian mi&s;&s;ion at Goa, was one deputed to this enterpri&s;e, which, at length, proved too much for Romi&s;h zeal and Je&s;uitical dexterity.</P>
<P>With much difficulty he and his companions reach|ed and got footing in the empire, where they had to endure a climate rendered by exce&s;&s;ive heats and rains pe&s;tiferous, and to engage in perilous journies acro&s;s de&s;arts infe&s;ted by banditti, in perpetual fear of them and of wild bea&s;ts, the tokens of who&s;e depredations marked their way. When they arrived at the habita|tions of the people, their dangers were changed, but not dimini&s;hed; &s;ometimes they could not obtain provi&s;ions, and at others, were confined to their hou&s;es by the dread of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Tho&s;e who were to be their di&s;ciples, profe&s;&s;ed, it is true, a &s;uper&s;titious religion, in &s;ome parts Judaical, in many others re|&s;embling that of the church of Rome; but it had had little effect on their minds: moral virtues they had
<PB N="24" REF="25">
&s;carcely any; in &s;ocial affections they were mi&s;erably deficient, and their approaches to civilization and ele|gance were on a level with tho&s;e of their &s;outhern neighbours at the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>But labour and patience produced in time, a hope that the mi&s;&s;ion would not be fruitle&s;s: the number of their pro&s;elytes was, at one period, &s;o great, that the corporal &s;trength of the fathers was exhau&s;ted in the exhortations previous to bapti&s;m. <Q REND="inline">'We erected our tent,' &s;ays Lobo, 'and placed our altar under &s;ome great trees, for the benefit of the &s;hade; and every day before &s;un-ri&s;ing, my companion and I began to catechi&s;e and in&s;truct the&s;e new catholics, and u&s;ed our utmo&s;t endeavours to make them abjure their errors. When we were weary with &s;peaking, we placed in ranks tho&s;e who were &s;uffi|ciently in&s;tructed, and pa&s;&s;ing through them with great ve&s;&s;els of water, baptized them according to the form pre&s;cribed by the church. As their num|ber was very great, we cried aloud<HI>&mdash;tho&s;e of this rank are named</HI> Anthony<HI>&mdash;tho&s;e of that rank</HI> Peter;&mdash;and did the &s;ame among the women, whom we &s;e|parated from among the men. We then confe&s;&s;ed them, and admitted them to the communion. After ma&s;s we applied our&s;elves again to catechi&s;e, to in|&s;truct, and receive the renunciation of their errors, &s;carce allowing our&s;elves time to make a &s;canty meal, which we never did more than once a day.'</Q></P>
<P>Zeal equal to this, and ri&s;ing in proportion to the oppo&s;ition it met with, did the&s;e pious fathers exerci&s;e during nine years that they remained in Aby&s;&s;inia. Their &s;ucce&s;s was various and fluctuating; &s;ometimes it gave them ground to hope that all would be con|verted,
<PB N="25" REF="26">
and &s;ometimes their patrons and pro&s;elytes became their mo&s;t inveterate per&s;ecutors: their hard|&s;hips were increa&s;ed by civil commotions, and all their expectations were clouded by the death of the Empe|ror, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;or was a bigot in the religion of the country. They then put them&s;elves under the pro|tection of a prince, who had emancipated him&s;elf from the power of Aby&s;&s;inia, and thought, that as he had afforded them &s;uccour, they &s;hould be &s;afe in his domi|nions; but they were &s;oon convinced of their error, by receiving orders to prepare to &s;erve, or in other words become &s;laves to the Turks:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'a me&s;&s;age,' &s;ays Lobo, 'which filled us with &s;urpri&s;e; it having never been known that one of the&s;e lords had ever abandoned any whom he had taken under his protection; and it is, on the contrary, one of the highe&s;t points of honour among&s;t them, to ri&s;que their lives and their fortunes in the defence of their dependents who have implored their protection: but neither law nor ju&s;tice were of any advantage to us, and the cu&s;toms of the country were doomed to be broken when they would have contributed to our &s;ecurity.'</Q></P>
<P>From M. Le Grand's information it appears, that the conduct of the&s;e mi&s;&s;ionaries in Aby&s;&s;inia had been &s;uch as tended rather to exa&s;perate than conciliate: they con&s;idered them&s;elves, not only figuratively, as the generals of Chri&s;t's church militant, and propa|gated their faith by mea&s;ures that rendered them and their doctrine odious. The peace of the country and their re&s;idence in it were become incompatible: they were accordingly delivered into the hands of the Turks; and experienced, from a little troop &s;ent to convoy them, greater humanity than the Aby&s;&s;ins had
<PB N="26" REF="27">
&s;hewn them: at Suaquem, an i&s;land in the Red Sea, terms of ran&s;om were propo&s;ed to them, which, though exorbitant, they were forced to accept; and, after &s;urmounting many ob&s;tacles and perils, that part of the mi&s;&s;ion with which Lobo was engaged, returned to Goa.</P>
<P>The revenge, which it was reported in Aby&s;&s;inia, the court of Portugal meditated, rendered a people naturally inhuman, ferocious: the remaining mi&s;&s;ion|aries experienced &s;till harder fate than Lobo and his companions; many were put to death, and the whole fraternity &s;o completely extirpated, that, after many efforts, all attempts to make a catholic people of the Aby&s;&s;ins were abandoned, as chimerical and im|practicable.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;ertations at the end of this work, and which John&s;on &s;eems to e&s;timate highly, contain va|riety of information and controver&s;ial learning, par|ticularly re&s;pecting the difference between the church that &s;ent the mi&s;&s;ion, and that which received it, and point out very clearly the inutility of endeavours founded on the principles of the Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>Having completed this tran&s;lation, which I con|jecture he was paid for by &s;ome book&s;eller of Birming|ham, who publi&s;hed it in an octavo volume, John&s;on, in February 1733-4, left that place, and returned to Lichfield, from whence, in the month of Augu&s;t fol|lowing, he i&s;&s;ued a propo&s;al, &s;oliciting a &s;ub&s;cription to an edition of Politian's Poems<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The propo&s;al notifies, that &s;ub&s;criptions would be taken in by N.

<P>From the above particulars it evidently appears, that he had entertained a re&s;olution to depend for a livelihood upon what he &s;hould be able, either in the way of original compo&s;ition, or tran&s;lation, or in edit|ing the works of celebrated authors, to procure by his &s;tudies, and, in &s;hort, to become an author by profe&s;&s;ion; an occupation, which, though it may, in &s;ome views of it, be deemed mercenary, as adapting it&s;elf to particular occa&s;ions and conjunctures, nay, to the intere&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, and even hu|mours of mankind, has yet &s;ome illu&s;trious examples, at lea&s;t in our times, to ju&s;tify it. It is true, that many per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e writings which are the effect of a natural impul&s;e of genius, and tho&s;e other that owe their exi&s;tence to intere&s;ted motives, and, being the offspring of another parent, may, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to be illegitimate; but, John&s;on knew of no &s;uch di&s;tinction, and would never acqui|e&s;ce in it when made by others: on the contrary, I have, more than once, heard him a&s;&s;ert, that he knew of no genuine motive for writing, other than ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this his de&s;ign, he, in the year, 1734, made a tender of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Cave, the editor, printer, and publi&s;her of the Gentleman's Magazine; a man of whom I &s;hall hereafter have

<P>As you appear no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than your readers, of the defect of your poetical article, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to you the &s;entiments of a per&s;on, who will undertake, on rea&s;onable terms, &s;ometimes to fill a column.</P>
<P>His opinion is, that the public would not give you a bad reception, if, be&s;ide the current wit of the month, which a critical examination would generally reduce to a narrow compa&s;s, you admitted, not only poems, in&s;criptions, &amp;c. never printed be|fore, which he will &s;ometimes &s;upply you with, but likewi&s;e &s;hort literary di&s;&s;ertations in Latin or Engli&s;h, critical remarks on authors ancient or mo|dern, forgotten poems that de&s;erve revival, or loo&s;e pieces, like Floyer's, worth pre&s;erving. By this method, your Literary Article, for &s;o it might be called, will, he thinks, be better recommended to the public, than by low je&s;ts, aukward buffoonery, or the dull &s;currilities of either party.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a corre&s;pondence will be agreeable to you, be plea&s;ed to inform me, in two po&s;ts, what the con|ditions are on which you &s;hall expect it. Your late offer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A prize of fifty pounds for the be&s;t poem <Q REND="inline">'on Life, Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell.'</Q></NOTE> gives me no rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t your genero&s;ity.

</LETTER>
<P>To this letter Cave returned an an&s;wer, dated 2d December following, wherein he accepted the &s;ervices of John&s;on, and retained him as a corre&s;pondent and a contributor to his Magazine.</P>
<P>This corre&s;pondence exhibits a view of the Gentle|man's Magazine in its rudiments, and may excite a curio&s;ity in the patrons thereof, to trace back to its origin the publication of a mi&s;cellany, the fame where|of has extended it&s;elf to the mo&s;t remote parts of the literary world. Hi&s;tories of the learned men of mo|dern times, and &s;hort abridgments of their works, as al&s;o &s;uch pieces as for their brevity required &s;ome vehicle to convey them to po&s;terity, it has been the practice of foreign countries, in their memoirs, and of univer&s;ities and academies, in their acts and tran&s;actions, to give. The hi&s;torical and memorable diurnal events of the pa&s;&s;ing times, have al&s;o been recorded in publi|cations variou&s;ly denominated, particularly, in a work, entitled the Political State of Great Britain, begin|ning with the year 1711, and compiled by the well known Abel Boyer. In this are contained debates and &s;peeches in parliament; and al&s;o, ab&s;tracts of po|litical
<PB N="30" REF="31">
pamphlets; but of a work that &s;hould com|prehend intelligence of both the&s;e kinds, we know of no exemplar in this country, earlier than the year 1716, when an e&s;&s;ay towards &s;uch a one was made in the publication of a book, entitled The Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter, containing, an impartial relation of all tran&s;|actions foreign and dome&s;tic, by a body of men, from whom few would have expected any thing of the kind. In &s;hort, the editors of the Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter, were the members of a &s;ociety, a&s;&s;ociated about the year above-mentioned, for the purpo&s;e of in&s;urance from fire, which, from the badge a&s;&s;umed by them, obtained the denomination of the Sun-fire-Office, and is &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate. One of the managing per&s;ons in this &s;ociety, was, if my informa|tion mi&s;leads me not, a man of the name of Povey, who, by the way, was a great improver of that u&s;eful project, the Penny Po&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original inventor thereof was one Mr. Dockwra, a citi|zen of &s;uch eminence, that he &s;tood for the office of Chamberlain, again&s;t Sir Wm. Fazakerley.</NOTE> and died within my memory. Having a &s;cheming head, a plau&s;ible tongue, and a ready pen, he prevailed on his fellow-members to un|dertake the above publication, foreign as it was to the nature of their in&s;titution. In Strype's continuation of Stow's Survey, I find the following article re&s;pect|ing this &s;ociety: <Q REND="inline">'All per&s;ons taking out policies for in&s;urance, mu&s;t pay two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence per quarter; and, be&s;ides their in&s;urance, &s;hall have a book, called the Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter, left every quarter at their hou&s;e.'</Q></P>
<P>The Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter gave al&s;o an account of the proceedings of Parliament: the fir&s;t volume contains
<PB N="31" REF="32">
the &s;peeches in both hou&s;es, on the debate on the Septennial Bill; but, &s;o great is the caution ob&s;erved in drawing them up, that none of tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords are appropriated, otherwi&s;e, than by &s;uch words as the&s;e: <Q REND="inline">'A noble Duke &s;tood up, and &s;aid,' 'This &s;peech was an&s;wered by a Northern Peer,'</Q> and other &s;uch vague de&s;ignations. In tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the names of the &s;peakers, Mr. Shippen, Mr. Hampden, Sir Richard Steele, and others are gi|ven, without any artifices of concealment.</P>
<P>This publication was continued to the year 1737, inclu&s;ive, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;uper|&s;eded by the Gentleman's Magazine, which was then ri&s;ing very fa&s;t in its reputation.</P>
<P>From the Hi&s;torical Regi&s;ter the hint was taken, of a publication, entitled The Grub-&s;treet Journal,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mention is often made, in the Dunciad and other modern books, of Grub-&s;treet writers and Grub-&s;treet publications, but the terms are little under&s;tood: the following hi&s;torical fact will explain them: During the u&s;urpation, a prodigious number of &s;editions and libellous pamphlets and papers, tending to exa&s;perate the peo|ple, and encrea&s;e the confu&s;ion in which the nation was involved, were from time to time publi&s;hed. The authors of the&s;e were, for the mo&s;t part, men who&s;e indigent circum&s;tances compelled them to live in the &s;uburbs and mo&s;t ob&s;cure parts of the town; Grub|&s;treet then abounded with mean and old hou&s;es, which were let out in lodgings, at low rents, to per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, who&s;e occu|pation was the publi&s;hing anonymous trea&s;on and &s;lander. One of the original inhabitants of this &s;treet was Fox the Martyrologi&s;t, who, during his abode there, wrote his Acts and Monuments. It was al&s;o rendered famous by having been the dwelling-place of Mr. Henry Welby, a gentleman of whom it is related in a printed nar|rative that he lived there forty years without being &s;een of any.</NOTE> which, be&s;ides a brief account of public occurrences, contained critici&s;ms and cen&s;ures of dull and profane
<PB N="32" REF="33">
or immoral books and pamphlets, as al&s;o, original e&s;&s;ays and letters to the editors. The chief conductors of it, were, Dr. John Martyn, then a young phy&s;ician, afterwards profe&s;&s;or of botany in the univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge, and Dr. Ru&s;&s;el, al&s;o a phy&s;ician; the former a&s;|&s;umed the name Bavius, and the latter Maevius. Its fir&s;t publication was in January, 1730, and it meeting with encouragement, Cave projected an improvement there|on in a pamphlet of his own, and in the following year gave to the world the fir&s;t number of the Gentleman's Magazine, with a notification that the &s;ame would be continued monthly, incurring thereby a charge of plagiari&s;m, which, as he is &s;aid to have confe&s;&s;ed it, we may &s;uppo&s;e he did not look upon as criminal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of the &s;ociety of Grub-&s;treet. Preface, page xii. et &s;eqq.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>John&s;on had not by his letter, herein before in&s;erted, &s;o attached him&s;elf to Cave, as not to be at liberty to enter into a clo&s;er engagement with any other per&s;on: he, therefore, in 1736, made overtures to the Rev. Mr. Budworth, then ma&s;ter of the grammar &s;chool at Brerewood, in Stafford&s;hire, and who had been bred under Mr. Blackwall, at Market Bo&s;worth, to become his a&s;&s;i&s;tant; but Mr. Budworth thought him|&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of declining them, from an ap|prehen&s;ion that tho&s;e convul&s;ive motions to which John&s;on through life was &s;ubject, might render him an object of imitation, and po&s;&s;ibly of ridicule, with his pupils.</P>
<P>It may be remembered that in a preceding page, John&s;on is &s;aid to have re&s;ided for &s;ome months, in the year 1734, in the hou&s;e of a per&s;on named
<PB N="33" REF="34">
Jarvis, at Birmingham. To this circum&s;tance, by a conjecture not improbable, may be referred an impor|tant event of his life. At that time there dwelt at Bir|mingham a widow, the relict of Mr. Porter a mercer, who dying, left her, if not well jointured, &s;o provided for, as made a match with her to a man in John&s;on's circum&s;tances de&s;irable: report &s;ays, &s;he was rather advanced in years; it is certain that &s;he had a &s;on and daughter grown up; the former was in the la&s;t war a captain in the navy, and his &s;i&s;ter, lately dead, inherited from him a hand&s;ome fortune, acquired in the cour&s;e of a long &s;ervice. Of her per&s;onal charms little can now be remembered: John&s;on has celebrated them in an in|&s;cription on her tomb at Bromley; but, con&s;idering his infirmity, and admitting the truth of a confe&s;&s;ion, &s;aid to have been made by him, that he never &s;aw <Q REND="inline">'the human face divine,'</Q> it may be que&s;tioned, whether him&s;elf was ever an eye-witne&s;s to them. The in|&s;cription further declares her to have been of the family of Jarvis, and gives colour to a &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he was either a &s;i&s;ter or other relation of the Jarvis above-mentioned.</P>
<P>With this per&s;on he married, his age being then about twenty-&s;even. Her fortune, which is conjectured to have been about eight hundred pounds, placed him in a &s;tate of affluence, to which before he had been a &s;tranger. He was not &s;o imprudent as to think it an inexhau&s;table mine; on the contrary, he reflected on the means of improving it. His acqui&s;itions at &s;chool and at the univer&s;ity, and the improvement he had made of his talents in the &s;tudy of the French and Italian languages, qualified him, in an eminent degree, for an in&s;tructor of youth in cla&s;&s;ical litera|ture;
<PB N="34" REF="35">
and the reputation of his father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">d the con|nections he had formed in and about Lichfield, pointed out to him a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding in that u&s;eful profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>There dwelt in the above-mentioned city, a very re&s;pectable gentleman, Mr. Gilbert Walm&s;ley, regi&s;ter of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court of the bi&s;hop thereof, to who&s;e hou&s;e, in his &s;chool and al&s;o in his univer&s;ity vacations, John&s;on was a welcome gue&s;t: the &s;ame per&s;on was al&s;o a friend of captain Garrick, who had for &s;ome time been re&s;ident at Lichfield, and, by con|&s;equence, of Mr. David Garrick, his &s;on. His cha|racter is &s;o well pourtrayed by John&s;on, and repre&s;ents in &s;uch lively colours his friend&s;hip for him, that it would be inju&s;tice to omit the in&s;ertion of it, as given in the life of Edmund Smith:&mdash;</P>
<Q REND="inline"><P>'Of Gilbert Walm&s;ley, thus pre&s;ented to my mind, let me indulge my&s;elf in the remembrance. I knew him very early; he was one of the fir&s;t friends that literature procured me; and, I hope that, at lea&s;t, my gratitude made me worthy of his notice.</P>
<P>'He was of an advanced age, and I was only not a boy; yet, he never received my notions with con|tempt. He was a whig, with all the virulence and malevolence of his party; yet difference of opinion did not keep us apart: I honoured him, and he en|dured me.</P>
<P>'He had mingled with the gay world, without exemption from its vices or its follies, but had ne|ver neglected the cultivation of his mind; his belie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> of revelation was un&s;haken; his learning pre&s;erved his principles; he grew fir&s;t regular, and then pious.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
'His &s;tudies had been &s;o various, that I am not able to name a man of equal knowledge. His acquain|tance with books was great, and what he did not immediately know, he could at lea&s;t tell where to find. Such was his amplitude of learning, and &s;uch his copiou&s;ne&s;s of communication, that it may be doubted whether a day now pa&s;&s;es, in which I have not &s;ome advantage from his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>'At this man's table I enjoyed many chearful and in&s;tructive hours, with companions, &s;uch as are not often found; with one who has lengthened, and one who has gladdened life; with Dr. James, who&s;e &s;kill in phy&s;ic will be long remembered; and with David Garrick, whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend: but what are the hopes of man! I am di&s;appointed by that &s;troke of death, which has eclip&s;ed the gaiety of nations, and impoveri&s;hed the public &s;tock of harmle&s;s plea&s;ure.'</P></Q>
<P>The benevolent per&s;on, &s;o gratefully remembered in the above encomium, knowing the abilities of John&s;on, encouraged him in his de&s;ign of becoming a teacher of literature: he &s;ugge&s;ted to him the taking a large hou&s;e, &s;ituate in a place adjacent to Lichfield; which, however the name of it be &s;pelt, the common people call Edjal: thither John&s;on went, and with him young Garrick, who, though he had been educated in Lichfield &s;chool, and was then near eighteen years old, having been diverted in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies by a call to Li&s;bon, &s;tood in need of improvement in the Latin and French languages.</P>
<P>The placing Garrick under the tuition of John&s;on, was an act of Mr. Walm&s;ley's, and re&s;embles that
<PB N="36" REF="37">
politic device of country hou&s;e-wives, the placing one egg in the ne&s;t of a hen to induce her to lay more: it &s;ucceeded &s;o far, as to draw from the families of the neighbouring gentry a few pupils, and among the re&s;t, a &s;on of Mr. Offley, of Stafford&s;hire; a name, that for centuries pa&s;t, may be traced in the hi&s;tory and records of that county. But, &s;o adver&s;e were his fortunes in this early period, that this well-planned &s;cheme of a &s;ettlement di&s;appointed the hopes of John&s;on and his friends; for, neither his own abilities; nor the patronage of Mr. Walm&s;ley, nor the exertions of Mrs. John&s;on and her relations, &s;ucceeded farther than to produce an acce&s;&s;ion of about five or &s;ix pupils; &s;o that his number, at no time, exceeded eight, and of tho&s;e not all were boarders.</P>
<P>After waiting a rea&s;onable time in hopes of more pupils, John&s;on, finding they came in but &s;lowly, had recour&s;e to the u&s;ual method of rai&s;ing a &s;chool. In the year, 1736, he adverti&s;ed the in&s;tructing young gentlemen in the Greek and Latin languages, by him|&s;elf, at his hou&s;e, de&s;cribing it near Lichfield.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is the adverti&s;ement which he publi&s;hed upon the occa&s;ion:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'At Edial, near Lichfield, in Stafford&s;hire, young gentlemen are boarded, and taught the Latin and Greek languages by SAMUEL JOHNSON.' <BIBL>Vide Gent.

<P>From two letters, fir&s;t in&s;erted in the Gentleman's Magazine, and &s;ince in &s;undry other publications, from Mr. Walm&s;ley to his friend the reverend Mr. Col&s;on, a mathematician, and, in his later years, Luca&s;ian profe&s;&s;or at Cambridge, little is to be learnt re&s;pecting the hi&s;tory of John&s;on and Garrick, at this period: the one wants the date of the month, the other that of the year; and though, in the order of their pub|lication, the one immediately follows the other, there mu&s;t have been &s;ome interval between the times of writing the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. The fir&s;t is dated in 1737, and, as it contains a recommendation of Gar|rick to Mr. Col&s;on, for in&s;truction in mathematics, philo&s;ophy, and human learning, leads us to &s;uppo&s;e, that before the time of writing it, John&s;on's &s;cheme of taking in boarders had proved abortive. The latter, written in what year we know not, and in&s;erted below, recommends both John&s;on and Garrick to his notice, the former as a good &s;cholar and one that gave hopes

Let it not excite wonder in any that &s;hall peru&s;e the&s;e memoirs, to be told, that Burton on Melancholy was a book that he frequently re&s;orted to for the purpo&s;e of exhilara|tion, or that, at times, he &s;hould find entertainment in turning over Knolles's voluminous and neglected hi&s;|tory of the Turks.

The &s;tage holds forth temptations to men of genius, which many have been glad to embrace: the profits ari&s;ing from a tragedy, including the re|pre&s;entation and printing of it, and the connections it &s;ometimes enables the author to form, were in John|&s;on's idea ine&s;timable; and, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but that Garrick, who, before this time, had manife&s;ted a propen&s;ity towards the &s;tage, had &s;ugge&s;ted to him the thought of writing one: certain it is, that during his re&s;idence at Edial, and under the eye of his friend Mr. Walm&s;ley, he planned and completed that poem which gave this gentleman occa&s;ion to &s;ay, he was likely to become a fine tragedy-writer.</P>

Mahomet the Great, fir&s;t emperor of the Turks, in the year 1453 laid &s;iege to the city of Con&s;tantinople, then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Greeks, and, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;t|ance, took and &s;acked it. Among the many young women whom his commanders thought fit to lay hands on and pre&s;ent to him, was one, named Irene, a Greek, of incomparable beauty and &s;uch rare per|fection of body and mind, that the emperor becoming enamoured of her, neglected the care of his govern|ment and empire for two whole years, and thereby &s;o exa&s;perated the Janizaries and other of his warlike &s;ubjects, that they mutinied, and threatened to dethrone him. To prevent this mi&s;chief, Mu&s;tapha Ba&s;&s;a, a per&s;on of great credit with him, undertook to repre|&s;ent to him the great danger to which he lay expo&s;ed by the indulgence of his pa&s;&s;ion: he called to his re|membrance the characters, actions, and atchievements of many of his predece&s;&s;ors, and the &s;tate of his govern|ment; and, in &s;hort, &s;o rou&s;ed him from his lethargy, that he took a horrible re&s;olution to &s;ilence the clamours of his people, by the &s;acrifice of this ad|mirable creature: accordingly, on a future day, he commanded her to be dre&s;&s;ed and adorned in the riche&s;t manner that &s;he and her attendants could de|vi&s;e, and again&s;t a certain hour i&s;&s;ued orders for the nobility and leaders of his army to attend him in the great hall of his palace. When they were all a&s;&s;embled, him&s;elf appeared with great pomp and magnificence, leading his late captive, but now ab|&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s, by the hand, uncon&s;cious of guilt and ignorant of his de&s;ign. With a furious and menacing look, he gave the beholders to under&s;tand, that he knew the cau&s;e of their di&s;content, and that he meant

<P>It no where appears that, in this journey to London, Mrs. John&s;on was one of the company; it is rather to be conjectured, that her hu&s;band, having abandoned the hope of &s;ucceeding in his attempt to rai&s;e a &s;chool, left to her the care of the hou&s;e, and the management of the &s;mall part of her fortune, which, after the fitting

<P>It is not my intention to pur&s;ue the hi&s;tory of Mr. Garrick's progre&s;s in life, both becau&s;e I have not taken upon me to be his biographer, and, becau&s;e the principal events of it occur in the memoirs of him, written with great candour and, I dare &s;ay, truth, by Mr. Thomas Davies, and by him publi&s;hed in two volumes, octavo; but the cour&s;e of this narration re|quires me occa&s;ionally to mention &s;uch particulars concerning him, as in any manner connect him with the &s;ubject I am engaged in; and this leads me to mention a fact concerning them both, that I had from a per&s;on now living, who was a witne&s;s to it, and of who&s;e veracity the lea&s;t doubt cannot be entertained. They had been but a &s;hort time in London before the &s;tock of money that each &s;et out with, was nearly exhau&s;ted; and, though they had not, like the pro|digal &s;on, <Q REND="inline">'wa&s;ted their &s;ub&s;tance in riotous living,'</Q> they began, like him, <Q REND="inline">'to be in want.'</Q> In this ex|tremity, Garrick &s;ugge&s;ted the thought of obtaining credit from a trade&s;man, whom he had a &s;light know|ledge of, Mr. Wilcox a book&s;eller, in the Strand: to him they applied, and repre&s;enting them&s;elves to him, as they really were, two young men, friends, and travellers from the &s;ame place, and ju&s;t arrived with a view to &s;ettle here, he was &s;o moved with their art|le&s;s tale, that, on their joint note, he advanced them all that their mode&s;ty would permit them to a&s;k, (five pounds), which was, &s;oon after, punctually re|paid.</P>

<P>Having ob&s;erved in your papers very uncommon offers of encouragement to men of letters, I have cho&s;en, being a &s;tranger in London, to communi|cate to you the following de&s;ign, which, I hope, if you join in it, will be of advantage to both of us.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent, having been lately tran&s;lated into French, and publi&s;hed with large notes by Dr. Le Courayer, the reputa|tion of that book is &s;o much revived in England, that, it is pre&s;umed, a new tran&s;lation of it from the Italian, together with Le Courayer's notes from the French, could not fail of a favourable recep|tion.</P>
<P>If it be an&s;wered that the hi&s;tory is already in Engli&s;h, it mu&s;t be remembered that there was the &s;ame objection again&s;t Le Courayer's undertak|ing, with this di&s;advantage, that the French had a ver&s;ion by one of their be&s;t tran&s;lators, whereas
<PB N="45" REF="46">
you cannot read three pages of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory without di&s;covering that the &s;tyle is capable of great improvements; but whether tho&s;e improvements are to be expected from this attempt, you mu&s;t judge from the &s;pecimen, which, if you approve the propo&s;al, I &s;hall &s;ubmit to your examina|tion.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the merit of the ver&s;ions equal, we may hope that the addition of the notes will turn the balance in our favour, con&s;idering the reputation of the Annotator.</P>

<P>Cave's acquie&s;cence, in the above propo&s;al, drew John&s;on into a clo&s;e intimacy with him: he was much at St. John's Gate, and taught Garrick the way thi|ther. Cave had no great reli&s;h for mirth, but he could bear it; and having been told by John&s;on, that his friend had talents for the theatre, and was come to London with a view to the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor, ex|pre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee him in &s;ome comic character: Garrick readily complied; and, as Cave him&s;elf told me, with a little preparation of the room over the great arch of St. John's gate, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few journeymen printers, who were called together for the purpo&s;e of reading the other parts, repre&s;ented, with all the graces of comic humor, the principal cha|racter in Fielding's farce of the Mock-Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
Cave's temper was phlegmatic: though he a&s;&s;umed, as the publi&s;her of the Magazine, the name of Sylva|nus Urban, he had few of tho&s;e qualities that con&s;ti|tute the character of urbanity. Judge of his want of them by this que&s;tion, which he once put to an author: <Q REND="inline">'Mr. &mdash;, I hear you have ju&s;t publi&s;hed a pam|phlet, and am told there is a very good paragraph in it, upon the &s;ubject of mu&s;ic: did you write that your&s;elf?'</Q> His di&s;cernment was al&s;o &s;low; and as he had already at his command &s;ome writers of pro&s;e and ver&s;e, who, in the language of book&s;ellers are called good hands,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mr. Mo&s;es Browne, originally a pen-cutter, was, &s;o far as con|cerned the poetical part of it, the chief &s;upport of the Magazine, which he fed with many a nouri&s;hing mor&s;el. This per&s;on being a lover of angling, wrote pi&s;catory eclogues; and was a candidate for the fifty pound prize mentioned in John&s;on's fir&s;t letter to Cave, and for other prizes which Cave engaged to pay him who &s;hould write the be&s;t poem on certain &s;ubjects; in all or mo&s;t of which competi|tions Mr. Browne had the good fortune to &s;ucceed. He publi&s;hed the&s;e and other poems of his writing, in an octavo volume, Lond. 1739; and has therein given proofs of an exuberant fancy and a happy invention. Some years after he entered into holy orders. A farther account of him may be &s;een in the Biographia Dramatica, to a place in which work he &s;eems to have acquired a title, by &s;ome juvenile compo&s;itions for the &s;tage. Being a per&s;on of a reli|gious turn, he al&s;o publi&s;hed in ver&s;e, a &s;eries of devout contempla|tions, called Sunday Thoughts. John&s;on, who often expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;like of religious poetry, and who, for the purpo&s;e of religious meditation, &s;eemed to think one day as proper as another, read them with cold approbation, and &s;aid, he had a great mind to write and publi&s;h Monday Thoughts.</P>
<P>To the proofs above adduced of the coar&s;ene&s;s of Cave's manners, let me add the following: he had undertaken, at his own ri&s;que, to publi&s;h a tran&s;lation of Du Halde's Hi&s;tory of China, in which were contained &s;undry geographical and other plates. Each of the&s;e he in&s;cribed to one or other of his friends; and, among the re&s;t, one <Q REND="inline">'<HI>To Mo&s;es Browne.</HI>'</Q> With this blunt and familiar de&s;ignation of his per&s;on, Mr. Browne was ju&s;tly offended: to appea&s;e him, Cave directed an engraver, to introduce with a caret under the line, <HI>Mr.</HI> and thought, that in &s;o doing, he had made ample amends to Mr. Browne for the indignity done him.</P>
<P>Mr. John Duick, al&s;o a pen-cutter, and a near neighbour of Cave, was a frequent contributor to the Magazine, of &s;hort poems, written with &s;pirit and ea&s;e. He was a kin&s;man of Browne, and the author of a good copy of encomia&s;tic ver&s;es prefixed to the collec|tion of Browne's poems above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Mr. Fo&s;ter Webb, a young man who had received his educa|tion in Mr. Watkins's academy in Spital-&s;quare, and afterwards became clerk to a merchant in the city, was, at fir&s;t, a contributor to the Magazine, of enigmas, a &s;pecies of poetry in which he then delighted, but was di&s;&s;uaded from it by the following lines, which appeared in the Magazine for October, 1740, after a few &s;ucce&s;sful e&s;&s;ays in that kind of writing:<Q><L>Too mode&s;t bard, with enigmatic veil</L>
<L>No longer let thy mu&s;e her charms conceal;</L>
<L>Though oft the Sun in clouds his face di&s;gui&s;e,</L>
<L>Still he looks nobler when he gilds the &s;kies.</L>
<L>Do thou, like him, avow thy native flame,</L>
<L> Bur&s;t thro' the gloom, and brighten into fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>After this friendly exhortation, Mr. Webb, in tho&s;e hours of lei&s;ure which bu&s;ine&s;s afforded, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with tran&s;lating from the Latin cla&s;&s;ics, particularly Ovid and Horace: from the latter of the&s;e he rendered into Engli&s;h ver&s;e, with better &s;ucce&s;s than any that had before attempted it, the odes <Q REND="inline">'Quis multa gracilis te puer in ro&s;a;' 'Solvitur acris hyems grata vice veris, &amp; Favoni,' 'Parcus Deorum cultor &amp; infrequens;' and 'Diffug&ecirc;re ni|ves, redeunt jam gramina campis;'</Q> all which are in&s;erted in Cave's Magazine. His &s;ignature was &s;ometimes Telarius, at others Ve|da&s;tus. He was a mode&s;t, ingenious, and &s;ober young man; but a con&s;umption defeated the hopes of his friends, and took him off in the twenty-&s;econd year of his age.</P>
<P>Mr. John Smith, another of Mr. Watkins's pupils, was a writer in the Magazine, of pro&s;e e&s;&s;ays, chiefly on religious and moral &s;ubjects, and died of a decline about the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Mr. John Canton, apprentice to the above-named Mr. Watkius, and al&s;o his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in his academy, was a contributor to the Ma|gazine, of ver&s;es, and afterwards, of papers on philo&s;ophical and mathematical &s;ubjects. The di&s;coveries he made in electricity and magneti&s;m are well known, and are recorded in the tran&s;actions of the Royal Society, of which he afterwards became a member.</P>
<P>Mr. William Rider, bred in the &s;ame prolific &s;eminary, was a writer in the Magazine, of ver&s;es &s;igned Philargyrus. He went from &s;chool to Je&s;us college, Oxford, and, &s;ome years after his leaving the &s;ame, entered into holy orders, and became &s;ur-ma&s;ter of St. Paul's &s;chool, in which office he continued many years, but at length was obliged to quit that employment by rea&s;on of his deafne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Adam Calamy, a &s;on of Dr. Edmund Calamy, an eminent non-conformi&s;t divine, and author of the Abridgment of Mr. Baxter's Hi&s;tory of his Life and Times, was another of Mr. Watkins's pupils, that wrote in the Magazine; the &s;ubjects on which he chiefly exer|ci&s;ed his pen were e&s;&s;ays in polemical theology and republican poli|tics; and he di&s;tingui&s;hed them by the a&s;&s;umed &s;ignature of <Q REND="inline">'<HI>A con&s;i&s;tent prote&s;tant.</HI>'</Q> He was bred to the profe&s;&s;ion of an attorney, and was brother to Mr. Edmund Calamy, a di&s;&s;enting teacher, of eminence for his worth and learning.</P>
<P>A &s;eminary, of a higher order than that above-mentioned, viz. the academy of Mr. John Eames in Moorfields, furni&s;hed the Magazine with a number of other corre&s;pondents in mathematics and other branches of &s;cience and polite literature. This was an in&s;titution &s;upported by the Di&s;&s;enters, the de&s;ign whereof was to qualify young men for their mini&s;try. Mr. Eames was formerly the con|tinuator of the abridgement of the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions be|gun by Jones and Lowthorp, and was a man of great knowledge, and a very able tutor. Under him were bred many young men who afterwards became eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for learning and abilities; among them were the late Mr. Parry, of Cirence&s;ter, the late Dr. Furneaux, and Dr. Gibbons; and, if I mi&s;take not, the pre&s;ent Dr. Price. The pupils of this academy had heads that teemed with knowledge, which, as fa&s;t as they acquired it, they were prompted by a juvenile and laudable ambition to communicate in letters to Mr. Urban.</P>
<P>To this account of Cave's corre&s;pondents might be added the celebrated names of Dr. Birch, who will be &s;poken of hereafter, Mrs. Carter, Dr. Aken&s;ide, the Rev. Mr. Samuel Pegge, who, by an ingenious tran&s;po&s;ition of the letters of his name, formed the plau&s;ible &s;ignature of Paul Gem&s;ege; Mr. Luck, of Barn&s;taple in Devon&s;hire; Mr. Henry Price, of Pool, in Dor&s;et&s;hire; Mr. Rich|ard Yate, of Chively, in Shrop&s;hire; Mr. John Bancks; and, that indu&s;trious and prolific genius, Mr. John Lockman.</P></NOTE> he was the backwarder in making
<PB N="47" REF="48">
advances, or courting an intimacy with John&s;on. Up|on the fir&s;t approach of a &s;tranger, his practice was to continue &s;itting, a po&s;ture in which he was ever to be found, and, for a few minutes, to continue &s;ilent:
<PB N="48" REF="49">
if at any time he was inclined to begin the di&s;cour&s;e, it was generally by putting a leaf of the Magazine, then in the pre&s;s, into the hand of his vi&s;itor, and a&s;king his opinion of it. I remember that, calling in on
<PB N="49" REF="50">
him once, he gave me to read the beautiful poem of Collins, written for Shake&s;peare's Cymbeline, <Q REND="inline">'To fair Fidele's gra&s;&s;y tomb,'</Q> which, though adapted to a particular circum&s;tance in the play, Cave was for in&s;erting in his Magazine, without any reference to the &s;ubject: I told him it would lo&s;e of its beauty if it were &s;o publi&s;hed: this he could not &s;ee; nor could he be convinced of the propriety of the name Fidele: he thought Pa&s;tora a better, and &s;o printed it.</P>
<P>He was &s;o incompetent a judge of John&s;on's abili|ties, that, meaning at one time to dazzle him with the &s;plendor of &s;ome of tho&s;e luminaries in literature who favoured him with their corre&s;pondence, he told him that, if he would, in the evening, be at a certain ale|hou&s;e in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, he might have a chance of &s;eeing Mr. Browne and another or
<PB N="50" REF="51">
two of the per&s;ons mentioned in the preceding note: John&s;on accepted the invitation; and being introdu|ced by Cave, dre&s;&s;ed in a loo&s;e hor&s;eman's coat, and &s;uch a great bu&s;hy uncombed wig as he con&s;tantly wore, to the &s;ight of Mr. Browne, whom he found &s;itting at the upper end of a long table, in a cloud of tobacco-&s;moke, had his curio&s;ity gratified.</P>
<P>John&s;on &s;aw very clearly tho&s;e offen&s;ive particulars that made a part of Cave's character; but, as he was one of the mo&s;t quick-&s;ighted men I ever knew in di&s;covering the good and amiable qualities of others, a faculty which he has di&s;played, as well in the life of Cave, as in that of Savage, printed among his works, &s;o was he ever inclined to palliate their defects; and, though he was above courting the patronage of a man, whom, for many rea&s;ons, he could not but hold cheap, he di&s;dained not to accept it, when tendered with any degree of complacency.</P>
<P>And this was the general tenor of John&s;on's beha|viour; for, though his character through life was marked with a roughne&s;s that approached to ferocity, it was in the power of almo&s;t every one to charm him into mildne&s;s, and to render him gentle and placid, and even courteous, by &s;uch a patient and re&s;pectful at|tention as is due to every one, who, in his di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ignifies a de&s;ire either to in&s;truct or delight. Bred to no profe&s;&s;ion, without relations, friends, or inte|re&s;t, John&s;on was an adventurer in the wide world, and had his fortunes to make: the arts of in&s;inuation and addre&s;s were, in his opinion, too &s;low in their operation to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e; and, he rather cho&s;e to di&s;play his parts to all the world, at the ri&s;que of being thought arrogant, than to wait for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="51" REF="52">
of &s;uch friends as he could make, or the patronage of &s;ome individual that had power or influence, and who might have the kindne&s;s to take him by the hand, and lift him into notice. With all that a&s;perity of manners with which he has been charged, and which kept at a di&s;tance many, who, to my knowledge, would have been glad of an intimacy with him, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the affections of pity and compa&s;&s;ion in a mo&s;t eminent de|gree. In a mixed company, of which I was one, the conver&s;ation turned on the pe&s;tilence which raged in London, in the year 1665, and gave occa&s;ion to John|&s;on to &s;peak of Dr. Nathanael Hodges, who, in the height of that calamity, continued in the city, and was almo&s;t the only one of his profe&s;&s;ion that had the cou|rage to oppo&s;e the endeavours of his art to the &s;pread|ing of the contagion. It was the hard fate of this per|&s;on, a &s;hort time after, to die a pri&s;oner for debt, in Ludgate: John&s;on related this circum&s;tance to us, with the tears ready to &s;tart from his eyes; and, with great energy, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Such a man would not have been &s;uffered to peri&s;h in the&s;e times.'</Q></P>
<P>It &s;eems by the event of this fir&s;t expedition, that John&s;on came to London for little el&s;e than to look about him: it affored him no opportunity of forming connections, either valuable in them&s;elves, or available to any future purpo&s;e of his life. Mr. Pope had &s;een and commended his tran&s;lation of the Me&s;&s;iah; but John&s;on had not the means of acce&s;s to him; and, be|ing a &s;tranger to his per&s;on, his &s;pirit would not per|mit him to &s;olicit &s;o great a favour from one, who mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been troubled with &s;uch kind of applications. With one per&s;on, however, he com|menced an intimacy, the motives to which at fir&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="53">
view, may probably &s;eem harder to be accounted for, than any one particular in his life. This per&s;on was Mr. Richard Savage, who&s;e misfortunes, together with his vices, had driven him to St. John's gate, and thereby introduced him to the acquaintance of John&s;on, which, founded on his part in compa&s;&s;ion, &s;oon improv|ed into friend&s;hip and a mutual communication of &s;en|timents and coun&s;els. The hi&s;tory of this man is well known by the life of him written by John&s;on; which, if in no other re&s;pect valuable, is curious, in that it gives to view a character &s;elf-formed, as owing nothing to parental nurture, and &s;carce any thing to moral tuition, and de&s;cribes a mind, in which, as in a ne|glected garden, weeds, without the lea&s;t ob&s;truction, were &s;uffered to grow into luxuriance: nature had en|dowed him with fine parts, and tho&s;e he cultivated as well as he was able; but his mind had received no moral culture, and for want thereof, we find him to have been a &s;tranger to humility, gratitude, and tho&s;e other virtues that tend to conciliate the affections of men, and in&s;ure the continuance of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>It may be conjectured that John&s;on was captivated by the addre&s;s and demeanour of Savage, at his fir&s;t approach; for it mu&s;t be noted of him, that, though he was always an admirer of genteel manners, he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> this time had not been accu&s;tomed to the conver&s;ation of gentlemen; and Savage, as to his exterior, was, to a remarkable degree, accompli&s;hed: he was a hand&s;ome well-made man, and very courteous in the modes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;alutation.

<PB N="53" REF="54">
 weapon, may be inferred from the u&s;e he made of it in that ra&s;h encounter which is related in his life, and to which his greate&s;t misfortunes were owing. The&s;e accompli&s;hments, and the ea&s;e and plea&s;antry of his conver&s;ation, were, probably, the charms that wrought on John&s;on, and hid from his view tho&s;e ba&s;er qualities of Savage, with which, as his hi&s;torian, he has neverthele&s;s been nece&s;&s;itated to mark his cha|racter. The &s;imilarity of their circum&s;tances might farther conduce to beget an unre&s;erved confidence in each other; they had both felt the pangs of poverty, and the want of patronage: Savage had let loo&s;e his re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of wealth, in a collection of poems printed about the year 1727, and John&s;on was ripe for an avowal of the &s;ame &s;entiments: they &s;eemed both to agree in the vulgar opinion, that the world is divided into two cla&s;&s;es, of men of merit with|out riches, and men of wealth without merit; never con&s;idering the po&s;&s;ibility that both might concenter in the &s;ame per&s;on, ju&s;t as when, in the compari&s;on of women, we &s;ay, that virtue is of more value than beauty, we forget that many are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of both.</P>
<P>In &s;peculations of this kind, and a mutual condo|lence of their fortunes, they pa&s;&s;ed many a melancholy hour, and tho&s;e at a time when, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, the reflection on them had made repo&s;e de&s;irable: on the contrary, that very reflection is known to have in|terrupted it. John&s;on has told me, that whole nights have been &s;pent by him and Savage in conver&s;ations of this kind, not under the ho&s;pitable roof of a tavern, where warmth might have invigorated their &s;pirits, and wine di&s;pelled their care; but in a perambulation round the &s;quares of We&s;tmin&s;ter, St. James's in
<PB N="54" REF="55">
particular, when all the money they could both rai&s;e was le&s;s than &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e for them the &s;helter and fordid comforts of a night cellar.</P>
<P>Of the re&s;ult of their conver&s;ations little can now be known, &s;ave, that they gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e principles of patrioti&s;m, that both, for &s;ome years after, avowed; they both with the &s;ame eye &s;aw, or believed they &s;aw, that the then mini&s;ter meditated the ruin of this coun|try; that exci&s;e laws, &s;tanding armies, and penal &s;tatutes, were the means by which he meant to effect it; and, at the ri&s;que of their liberty, they were bent to oppo&s;e his mea&s;ures; but Savage's &s;pirit was broken by the &s;en&s;e of his indigence, and the pre&s;&s;ure of tho&s;e misfor|tunes which his imprudence had brought on him, and John&s;on was left alone to maintain the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>The character and manners of Savage were &s;uch, as leave us little room to think, that John&s;on could pro|fit by his conver&s;ation: whatever were his parts and accompli&s;hments, he had no reading, and could fur|ni&s;h no intelligence to &s;uch a mind as John&s;on's: his vagrant cour&s;e of life had made him acquainted with the town and its vices; and though I am not warranted to &s;ay, that John&s;on was infected with them, I have rea&s;on to think, that he reflected with as little appro|bation on the hours he &s;pent with Savage as on any period of his life.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s there is in the example and conver&s;ation of &s;ome men a power that fa&s;cinates, and &s;u&s;pends the operation of our own will: to this power in Savage, which con&s;i&s;ted in the gentlene&s;s of his man|ners, the elegance of his di&s;cour&s;e, and the viva|city of his imagination, we mu&s;t attribute the a&s;cen|dant which he maintained over the affections of
<PB N="55" REF="56">
John&s;on, and the inability of the latter to pur&s;ue the &s;ugge&s;tions of his own &s;uperior under&s;tanding. To the purpo&s;e of this &s;entiment, I am tempted to relate a fact which Mr. Garrick once communicated to me in conver&s;ation, who, &s;peaking of the irre&s;i&s;tible charm of engaging manners, told me, that being an actor at Drury-lane theatre, under Mr. Fleetwood, the patentee thereof, who&s;e extravagances rendered him incapable of fulfilling his engagements, his &s;alary became deeply in arrear, and he began to feel the want of money: in an&s;wer to his many applications for payment, he had obtained promi&s;es, and even oaths; but the&s;e had been &s;o often broken, that, pre&s;&s;ed by nece&s;&s;ity, and provok|ed by ill u&s;age, he was determined to have recour&s;e to law for payment: he however thought it but right to declare his intention; and, for that purpo&s;e, invited him&s;elf to breakfa&s;t with Fleetwood. <Q REND="inline">'It was on a Sunday,' &s;aid Mr. Garrick, 'that he appointed to &s;ee me; he received me with great courte&s;y and affability, and entertained me for &s;ome hours with di&s;cour&s;e, foreign to the &s;ubject of our meeting, but &s;o bewitching in its kind, that it deprived me of the power of telling him that he owed me &s;ix hundred pounds, and that my nece&s;&s;ities compelled me to de|mand it.'</Q></P>
<P>The intimacy between Savage and John&s;on conti|nued till the beginning of the year 1738, when the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the former, and the ce&s;&s;ation, by the death of Queen Caroline, of a pen&s;ion, which, for &s;ome years, &s;he had directed to be paid him, moved &s;ome of his friends to a &s;ub&s;cription for his &s;upport, in a place &s;o far di&s;tant from the metropolis, as to be out of the reach of its temptations; where he might beget
<PB N="56" REF="57">
new habits, and indulge him&s;elf in tho&s;e exerci&s;es of his imagination, which had been the employment of his happie&s;t hours. The place fixed on for his re&s;i|dence was Swan&s;ea in Wales; but as it was &s;ome time before the &s;ub&s;cription could be completed, his re|tirement thither was retarded.</P>
<P>In this &s;u&s;pen&s;e of Savage's fortunes, John&s;on &s;eems to have confirmed him&s;elf in a re&s;olution of quarrelling with the admini&s;tration of public affairs, and becoming a &s;atiri&s;t on the manners of the times; and becau&s;e he thought he &s;aw a re&s;emblance between his own and tho&s;e of Rome in its decline, he cho&s;e to expre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of modern depravity by an imitation of the third &s;atire of Juvenal, in which, with great judgment, and no le&s;s a&s;perity, he drew a parallel between the cor|ruptions of each, and exemplified it by characters, then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. In it he anticipated the departure of his friend Thales, i. e. Savage, whom he de&s;cribes as
<Q><L>&mdash;re&s;olv'd, from vice and London far,</L>
<L>To breathe, in di&s;tant fields, a purer air;</L>
<L>And, fix'd in Cambria's &s;olitary &s;hore,</L>
<L>Give to St. David one true Briton more.</L></Q></P>
<P>To this exerci&s;e of his talent he was, probably, ex|cited by the &s;ucce&s;s of Mr. Pope, who had done the &s;ame by &s;ome of the &s;atires of Horace, and had vin|dicated, by the example of Dr. Donne a divine, that &s;pecies of writing, even in Chri&s;tian times, from the imputation of malevolence and the want of that cha|rity <Q REND="inline">'which is not ea&s;ily provoked, and endureth all things.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
The poem was fini&s;hed, as appears by a manu&s;cript note of the author in his own corrected copy, in 1738. While he was writing it, he lodged in an upper room of a hou&s;e in Exeter &s;treet, behind Exeter 'change, inhabited by one Norris, a &s;tay-maker; a particular which would have been hardly worth noticing, but that it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be&s;peaks his circum&s;tances at the time, and accounts for his having, more than once, mentioned in the poem, and that with &s;eeming abhorrence, the dungeons of the Strand. It is not unlikely that his aver&s;ion to &s;uch an abode was increa&s;|ed by the reflection on that di&s;tre&s;s, which by this time had brought his wife to town, and obliged her to par|ticipate in the inconveniences of a dwelling too ob|&s;cure to invite re&s;ort, and to be a witne&s;s of the diffi|culties with which he was &s;truggling.</P>
<P>Having completed his poem, he looked round for a book&s;eller, to whom, with a likelihood of ob|taining the value of it, he might treat for the &s;ale of it. His friend Cave, in re&s;pect of publications, was a haberda&s;her of &s;mall wares; the greate&s;t of his un|dertakings being a tran&s;lation of Du Halde's Hi&s;tory of China, which was never completed.</P>
<P>John&s;on thinking him a man for his purpo&s;e, made him an offer of his poem, in a letter in which, with great art, but without the lea&s;t violation of truth, he conceals that him&s;elf was the author of it. The letter I here in&s;ert, as al&s;o another of his on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>

I do not doubt but you will look over this poem with another eye, and reward it in a diffe|rent manner from a mercenary book&s;eller, who counts the lines he is to purcha&s;e, and con&s;iders nothing but the bulk. I cannot help taking notice that, be|&s;ides what the author may hope for on account of his abilities, he has likewi&s;e another claim to your regard, as he lies at pre&s;ent under very di&s;advantage|ous circum&s;tances of fortune. I beg, therefore, that you will favour me with a letter to-morrow, that I may know what you can afford to allow him, that he may either part with it to you, or find out (which I do not expect) &s;ome other way more to his &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I am &s;en&s;ible I have tran&s;cribed it very coar&s;ely, which, after having al|tered it, I was obliged to do.

John&s;on and Dod&s;ley were &s;oon agreed; the price a&s;ked by the one and a&s;&s;ented to by the other, was, as I have been informed, fifty pounds; a reward for his labour and ingenuity, that induced John&s;on ever after to call Dod&s;ley his patron. It is pretty certain that in his offer of the poem to Dod&s;ley, Cave &s;tipulated for the printing of it, for it came abroad in the year above|mentioned with the name of Cave as the printer, though without that of the author. Lord Lyttelton, the in&s;tant it was publi&s;hed, carried it in rapture to Mr. Pope, who, having read it, commended it highly, and was very importunate with Dod&s;ley to know the author's name; but, that being a &s;ecret the latter was bound not to reveal, Pope a&s;&s;ured him that he could not long be unknown, recollecting, perhaps, a pa&s;&s;age recorded of Milton, who, &s;eeing a beautiful young lady pa&s;s him whom he never had &s;een before, turned to look at her, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Whoever thou art, thou can&s;t not long be concealed.'</Q></P>
<P>The topics of this &s;pirited poem, &s;o far as it re&s;pects this country, or the time when it was written, are evi|dently drawn from tho&s;e weekly publications, which, to an&s;wer the view of a malevolent faction, fir&s;t created, and for &s;ome years &s;upported, a di&s;tinction between the intere&s;ts of the government and the people, under the &s;everal denominations of the court and the country parties: the&s;e publications were carried on under the direction of men, profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be whigs and friends of the people, in a paper intitled, <Q REND="inline">'The Country Journal or the Craft&s;man,'</Q> now de&s;ervedly forgotten, the end whereof was, to blow the flame of national di&s;content, to delude the hone&s;t and well-meaning people of this country into a belief that the mini&s;ter

was its greate&s;t enemy, and that his opponents, only, meant its welfare. To this end it was nece&s;&s;ary to fur|ni&s;h them with &s;ubjects of complaint, and the&s;e were plentifully di&s;&s;eminated among them; the chief of them were, that &s;cience was unrewarded, and the arts neglected; that the objects of our politics were peace and the exten&s;ion of commerce; that the wealth of the nation was unequally divided, for that, while &s;ome were poor, others were able to rai&s;e palaces and pur|cha&s;e manors; that re&s;traints were laid on the &s;tage; that the land was plundered, and the nation cheated; our &s;enators hirelings, and our nobility venal; and, la&s;tly, that in his vi&s;its to his native country, the king drained this of its wealth.</P>
<P>That John&s;on has adopted the&s;e vulgar complaints, his poem mu&s;t witne&s;s. I &s;hall not take upon me to demon&s;trate the fallacy of mo&s;t of the charges contain|ed in it, nor animadvert on the wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e, who, to effect their own ambitious de&s;igns, &s;cruple not to oppo&s;e the be&s;t endeavours of the per&s;on in power, nor &s;hall I mark the folly of tho&s;e who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;o deluded: the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of knave to knave, and fool to fool, is hereditary and inter|minable: our fathers were deceived by the pre|ten&s;ions of fal&s;e patriots; the delu&s;ion &s;topped not with their children, nor will it with our's.</P>
<P>The publication of this poem was of little advan|tage to John&s;on, other than the relief of his immediate wants: it procured him fame, but no patronage. He was therefore di&s;po&s;ed to embrace any other pro|&s;pect of advantage that might offer; for, a &s;hort time after, viz. in Augu&s;t 1738, hearing that the ma&s;ter|&s;hip
<PB N="62" REF="63">
of Appleby &s;chool in Leice&s;ter&s;hire was become vacant, he, by the advice of Sir Thomas Grie&s;ly a Derby&s;hire baronet, and other friends, went to Appleby, and offered him&s;elf as a candidate for that employment; but the &s;tatutes of the &s;chool requiring, that the per&s;on cho&s;en &s;hould be a Ma&s;ter of Arts, his application was checked. To get over this difficulty, he found means to obtain from the late Lord Gower, a letter to a friend of his, &s;oliciting his intere&s;t with Dean Swift towards procuring him a ma&s;ter's degree from the univer&s;ity of Dublin: the letter has appeared in print, but with a mi&s;taken date of the year, viz. 1737; for it mentions John&s;on's being the author of the poem of <Q REND="inline">'London,'</Q> which, as I have above fixed it, was writ|ten in 1738.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Samuel John&s;on, (author of London a &s;atire, and &s;ome other poetical pieces,) is a native of this country, and much re&s;pected by &s;ome worthy gen|tlemen in his neighbourhood, who are tru&s;tees of a charity &s;chool now vacant, the certain &s;alary of which is 60l. per year, of which they are de&s;irous to make him ma&s;ter; but, unfortunately, he is not capable of receiving their bounty, which would make him hap|py for life, by not being a Ma&s;ter of Arts, which, by the &s;tatutes of this &s;chool, the ma&s;ter of it mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e gentlemen do me the honour to think, that I have intere&s;t enough in you to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift, to per&s;uade the univer&s;ity of Dublin to &s;end a diploma to me, con&s;tituting this poor man Ma&s;ter of Arts in their univer&s;ity. They

highly extol the man's learning and probity, and will not be per&s;uaded that the univer&s;ity will make any difficulty of conferring &s;uch a favour upon a &s;tranger, if he is recommended by the Dean. They &s;ay he is not afraid of the &s;tricte&s;t examination, though he is of &s;o long a journey, and will venture it if the Dean thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, choo&s;ing rather to die upon the road, than to be &s;tarved to death in tran&s;lating for book&s;ellers, which has been his only &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for &s;ome time pa&s;t.</P>

<P>If ever John&s;on had rea&s;on to lament the &s;hortne&s;s of his &s;tay at the univer&s;ity, it was now. The want of an honour, which, after a &s;hort efflux of years, is con|ferred almo&s;t of cour&s;e, was, at this cri&s;is, his greate&s;t misfortune: it &s;tood between him and the acqui&s;ition of an income of 60l. a year, in a country and at a
<PB N="64" REF="65">
time that made it equivalent to a much larger &s;um at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The letter of Lord Gower failing of its effect, John&s;on returned to London, re&s;olving on a vigorous effort to &s;upply his wants: this was a tran&s;lation into Engli&s;h of Father Paul's Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Gent. Mag. for Jan. 1785, page 6.</NOTE>: the former by Sir Nathaniel Brent, though a faithful one, being, in the judgment of &s;ome per&s;ons, rather ob&s;olete. John&s;on was well enough &s;killed in the Italian language for the undertaking, and was encou|raged to it by many of his friends; as namely, Mr. Walm&s;ley, Mr. Ca&s;lon the letter-founder, Mr. [after|wards Dr.] Birch, and others; but he cho&s;e to make it a joint project, and take Cave into the adventure, who, as the work proceeded, advanced him &s;mall &s;ums, at two or three guineas a week, amounting to|gether to near fifty pounds.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Propo&s;als for publi&s;hing it were adverti&s;ed in the Weekly Mi&s;|cellany of 21&s;t Oct. 1738, in the following terms: <Q REND="inline">'Ju&s;t publi&s;h|ed, propo&s;als for printing the Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent, tran&s;lated from the Italian of Father Paul Sarpi, with the author's life, and notes Theological, Hi&s;torical and Critical, from the French edition of Dr. Le Courayer. To which are added, ob|&s;ervations on the hi&s;tory and notes; and illu&s;trations from various authors, both printed and manu&s;cript, by S. John&s;on, in two vo|lumes quarto.'</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>It happened at this time that another per&s;on of the &s;ame chri&s;tian and &s;urname, the then keeper of Dr. Teni&s;on's library in St. Martin's pari&s;h, had engaged in the like de&s;ign, and was &s;upported therein by Dr. Zachary Pearce, and al&s;o by mo&s;t of the bi&s;hops, and by many of the dignified clergy, which being the ca&s;e, the &s;olicitations in behalf of the two ver&s;ions cro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="65" REF="66">
each other, and rendered both abortive. Twelve quarto &s;heets of John&s;on's were printed off; but what became of the other is not known. This di&s;appoint|ment, however mortifying, did not hinder John&s;on from pro&s;ecuting a part of his original de&s;ign, and writing the life of the author, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a life of him, written by an Italian nobleman, who&s;e name I could never learn, and publi&s;hed in a clo&s;ely printed duodecimo, he was enabled to complete, and in an abridgment to in&s;ert in Cave's Maga|zine.</P>
<P>Various other projects about this time did he form of publications on literary &s;ubjects, which, in a &s;ub&s;e|quent page, by the help of a li&s;t in his own hand-writ|ing, I have enumerated, but they were either bla&s;ted by other publications of a &s;imilar nature, or abandoned for want of encouragement.</P>
<P>However, that he might not be totally unemployed, Cave engaged him to undertake a tran&s;lation of an Ex|amen of Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man, written by Mr. Crou&s;az, a profe&s;&s;or in Switzerland, who had acquired &s;ome eminence by a treati&s;e on Logic of his writing, and al&s;o, by his Examen de Pyrrhoni&s;me; and of whom John&s;on, after ob&s;erving that he was no mean anta|goni&s;t, has given this character:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'His mind was one of tho&s;e in which philo&s;ophy and piety are happily united. He was accu&s;tomed to argument and di&s;qui|&s;ition, and perhaps was grown too de&s;irous of detect|ing faults, but his intention was always right, his opinions were &s;olid, and his religion pure. His in|ce&s;&s;ant vigilance for the promotion of piety di&s;po&s;ed him to look with di&s;tru&s;t upon all metaphy&s;ical &s;y&s;|tems of Theology, and all &s;chemes of virtue and hap|pine&s;s purely rational; and therefore, it was not long
<PB N="66" REF="67">
before he was per&s;uaded that the po&s;itions of Pope, as they terminated for the mo&s;t part in natural reli|gion, were intended to draw mankind away from Revelation, and to repre&s;ent the whole cour&s;e of things as a nece&s;&s;ary concatenation of indi&s;&s;oluble fatality; and it is undeniable, that in many pa&s;&s;ages, a religious eye may ea&s;ily di&s;cover expre&s;&s;ions not very favourable to morals or to liberty.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Pope among the poets.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The reputation of the E&s;&s;ay on Man &s;oon after its publication invited a tran&s;lation of it into French, which was undertaken and completed by the Abb&eacute; Re&s;nel, and falling into the hands of Crou&s;az, drew from him fir&s;t a general cen&s;ure of the principles maintained in the poem, and afterwards, a commen|tary thereon containing particular remarks on every paragraph.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am pretty much of your opinion, that the Com|mentary cannot be pro&s;ecuted with any appearance of &s;ucce&s;s; for, as the names of the authors con|cerned are of more weight in the performance than its own intrin&s;ic merit, the public will be &s;oon &s;atis|fied with it. And I think the Examen &s;hould be pu&s;hed forward with the utmo&s;t expedition. Thus, This day, &amp;c. An Examen of Mr. Pope's e&s;&s;ay, &amp;c. containing a &s;uccinct account of the philo&s;ophy of Mr. Leibnitz on the &s;y&s;tem of the Fatali&s;ts, with a
<PB N="67" REF="68">
confutation of their opinions, and an illu&s;tration of the doctrine of Free-will, with what el&s;e you think proper.</P>
<P>It will, above all, be nece&s;&s;ary to take notice, that it is a thing di&s;tinct from the Commentary.</P>
<P>I was &s;o far from imagining they [the compo&s;itors] &s;tood &s;till, that I conceived them to have a good deal beforehand, and therefore was le&s;s anxious in pro|viding them more. But if ever they &s;tand &s;till on my account, it mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be charged to me; and whatever el&s;e will be rea&s;onable I &s;hall not op|po&s;e; but beg a &s;u&s;pen&s;e of judgment till morning, when I mu&s;t intreat you to &s;end me a dozen propo&s;als, and you &s;hall then have copy to &s;pare.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>John&s;on's tran&s;lation of the Examen was printed by Cave, and came abroad, but without a name, in No|vember, 1738, bearing the title of, <Q REND="inline">'An Examination of Mr. Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man, containing a &s;uccinct view of the &s;y&s;tem of the Fatali&s;ts, and a confutation of their opinions; with an illu&s;tration of the doctrine of Free-Will, and an enquiry what view Mr. Pope might have in touching upon the Leibnitzian Philo|&s;ophy and Fatali&s;m. By Mr. Crou&s;az, profe&s;&s;or of Philo&s;ophy and Mathematics at Lau&s;anne, &amp;c.'</Q></P>
<P>All the world knows that the E&s;&s;ay on Man was compo&s;ed from the dictamen of Lord Bolingbroke, and it is little le&s;s notorious that Pope was but mean|ly &s;killed in that &s;ort of learning to which the &s;ubject of his poem related: he had not been conver&s;ant with the writings or opinions of the different &s;ects of phi|lo&s;ophers
<PB N="68" REF="69">
of whom &s;ome maintained and others denied the freedom of the will, and knew little more of the arguments for and again&s;t human liberty in oppo&s;i|tion to what is called Nece&s;&s;ity, than he was able to gather from the controver&s;y between Anthony Collins and his opponents, or that between Dr. Clarke and Leibnitz. He was therefore unable to defend what he had written, and &s;tood a dead mark for his adver&s;aries to &s;hoot at. Fortunate for him it was, that at this cri&s;is there was living &s;uch a per&s;on as Mr. Warburton; and Pope had for all the remainder of his life rea&s;on to reflect with plea&s;ure on the accident that brought them acquainted, and which I will pre&s;ently relate.</P>
<P>Warburton's origin and ri&s;e into literary reputation are pretty well known. He had &s;erved a clerk&s;hip to an attorney the town-clerk of Newark upon Trent, and for a &s;hort time was him&s;elf a practi&s;er in that profe&s;&s;ion; but having a &s;trong propen&s;ity to learning, he determined to quit it, and pur&s;ue a cour&s;e of &s;tudy &s;uch as was nece&s;&s;ary to qualify him for the mini&s;terial function, and having completed it, got admitted into holy orders, and &s;ettled in London, where, upon his arrival, he became acquainted with &s;ome of the inferior wits, Concannen, Theobald, and others the enemies of Pope, and adopted many of their &s;entiments. In a letter to the former of the&s;e he writes, <Q REND="inline">'Dryden I ob&s;erve borrows for want of lei&s;ure, and Pope for want of genius; Milton out of pride, and Addi|&s;on out of mode&s;ty;'</Q> further he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Theobald with notes on many pa&s;&s;ages in his edition of Shake|&s;peare, which charge Mr. Pope with ignorance, and incapacity for the office of an editor.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
But leaving literal critici&s;m to the&s;e his fir&s;t a&s;&s;oci|ates, Warburton betook him&s;elf to &s;tudies of greater importance, and before the publication of the Examen of the E&s;&s;ay on Man, had made him&s;elf known, as an original thinker, by his Divine Legation of Mo&s;es, a work which, as it met with great oppo&s;ition, gave him occa&s;ion to di&s;play a &s;ingular talent in controver&s;y. As there was nothing congenial in the minds of him and Pope, they neither of them &s;ought the acquain|tance of the other, but mere chance brought them to|gether, a chance &s;o propitious to Warburton's fortunes that it became an epoch in his life, and was the leading circum&s;tance to his becoming the owner of a fair e&s;tate, and his promotion to a bi&s;hopric.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of the&s;e two per&s;ons had its com|mencement in that book&s;eller's &s;hop which is &s;ituate on the We&s;t &s;ide of the gate-way leading down the Inner Temple-lane. Warburton had &s;ome dealings with Jacob Robin&s;on the publi&s;her, to whom the &s;hop belonged, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been drawn there on bu&s;ine&s;s; Pope might have a call of the like kind: however that be, there they met, and entering into a conver&s;ation which was not &s;oon ended, con|ceived a mutual liking, and as we may &s;uppo&s;e, plighted their faith to each other. The fruit of this interview and the &s;ub&s;equent communications of the parties was, the publication, in November 1739, of a pamphlet with this title, <Q REND="inline">'A Vindication of Mr. Pope's E&s;&s;ay on Man. By the author of the Divine Legation of Mo&s;es. Printed for J. Robin&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether or not Crou&s;az ever replied to this vindi|cation, I am not at lei&s;ure to enquire. I incline to
<PB N="70" REF="71">
think he did not, and that the controver&s;y re&s;ted on the foot of the Examen and the Commentary on the one part, and the Vindication on the other. In the year 1743, John&s;on took it into his head to review the argument, and became a moderator in a di&s;pute which, on the &s;ide of Warburton, had been conducted with a great degree of that indignation and contempt of his adver&s;ary, which is vi&s;ible in mo&s;t of his writ|ings. This he did in two letters &s;everally publi&s;hed in the Gentleman's Magazine for the months of March and November in the above year, with a promi&s;e of more, but proceeded no farther than to &s;tate the &s;en|timents of Mr. Crou&s;az re&s;pecting the poem, from a &s;eeming conviction that he was di&s;cu&s;&s;ing an uninter|e&s;ting que&s;tion.</P>
<P>John&s;on had already tried his hand at political &s;atire, and had &s;ucceeded in it; and though no new occa&s;ion offered, he was either urged by di&s;tre&s;s or prompted by that clamour again&s;t the mini&s;ter which in the year 1739 was become very loud, to join in the popular cry, and as it were, to carry war into his own quarters. This he did in a pamphlet, intitled, <Q REND="inline">'Marmor Norfol|cien&s;e, or an e&s;&s;ay on an ancient prophetical in&s;crip|tion, in Monki&s;h rhyme, lately di&s;covered near Lynn in Norfolk, by Probus Britannicus.'</Q></P>
<P>This mode of &s;atire, the publication of prophecies adapted to the incidents of the time when written, and not &s;o genuine as that of Nixon, the Che&s;hire &s;eer, which &s;ome thought was fulfilled in 1745, is not an invention &s;o new as many may think. In &s;ome in|&s;tances it has been a mere exerci&s;e of wit; in others it has been u&s;ed as a means to excite a people to
<PB N="71" REF="72">
&s;edition. Under the fir&s;t cla&s;s is noted that mentioned by Lord Bacon;
<Q><L>When Hempe is &s;pun,</L>
<L>England's done;</L></Q>
whereby, as his lord&s;hip &s;ays, it was generally con|ceived, that after the princes had reigned which had the principal letters of that word Hempe, (which were Henry, Edward, Mary, Philip and Elizabeth) England &s;hould come to utter confu&s;ion; which, adds he, thanks be to God, is verified only in the change of name, for the king's &s;tile is now no more, of Eng|land, but of Britain. Of the latter cla&s;s of feigned prophecies many have, within the&s;e few years, been publi&s;hed by authors who had not wit enough to put them into ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The in&s;cription mentioned in the title-page of the Marmor Norfolcien&s;e, as al&s;o the relation of the man|ner of finding it, are, as will be readily &s;uppo&s;ed, equally fictitious, as the &s;ole end of writing and publi&s;hing it was to give occa&s;ion for a comment, which &s;hould concentrate all the topics of popular di&s;content: ac|cordingly it is in&s;inuated, becau&s;e an act of parliament had then lately pa&s;&s;ed, by which it was enacted that all law proceedings &s;hould be in Engli&s;h, that therefore few lawyers under&s;tood Latin; and the people are taught to look on the de&s;cendants of the Prince&s;s So|phia as intruders of ye&s;terday, receiving an e&s;tate by voluntary grant, and erecting thereon a claim of here|ditary right. The explanation of the prophecy, which is all ironical, re&s;olves it&s;elf into an invective again&s;t a &s;tanding army, a ridicule of the balance of power, complaints of the inactivity of the Briti&s;h lion, and that the Hanover hor&s;e was &s;uffered to &s;uck his blood.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
A publication &s;o inflammatory as this, could hardly e&s;cape the notice of any government, under which the legal idea of a libel might be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t. The principles it contained were &s;uch as the Jacobites of the time openly avowed; and warrants were i&s;&s;ued and me&s;&s;engers employed to apprehend the author, who, though he had forborne to &s;ub&s;cribe his name to the pamphlet, the vigilance of tho&s;e in pur&s;uit of him had di&s;covered. To elude the &s;earch after him, he, toge|ther with his wife, took an ob&s;cure lodging in a hou&s;e in Lambeth mar&s;h, and lay there concealed till the &s;cent after him was grown cold.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, 1739, an event aro&s;e that gave oc|ca&s;ion to John&s;on again to exerci&s;e his talent of &s;atire; viz. the refu&s;al of a licence for acting a tragedy inti|tled, <Q REND="inline">'Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, or the deliverer of his country,'</Q> written by Henry Brooke, to account for which &s;eeming injury, &s;ome previous information, &s;uch as I am now about to give, appears nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The places for theatrical repre&s;entations in this country were anciently the king's palace, and the man|&s;ions of the nobility; but, as the love of them increa&s;ed, taverns and other public hou&s;es in different parts of the city and &s;uburbs, were fitted up for the purpo&s;e, and called play-hou&s;es. The u&s;urpation and the principles of the times put a &s;top to &s;tage entertainments: at the re&s;toration they were revived, and the places for repre|&s;entation con&s;tructed in the form of theatres: their number, at no time after that period, exceeded four, and in the year 1728, and long before, it was reduced to three, namely, Drury lane, Lincoln's-inn fields, and the French playhou&s;e in the Hay-market. In that
<PB N="73" REF="74">
year, a man, of the name of Odell, took a throw&s;ter's &s;hop in Ayliffe &s;treet, Goodman's fields, and collecting together a number of &s;trolling players of both &s;exes, opened it as a theatre. Its contiguity to the city, &s;oon made it a place of great re&s;ort, and what was ap|prehended from the adverti&s;ement of plays to be ex|hibited in that quarter of the town, &s;oon followed: the adjacent hou&s;es became taverns, in name, but in truth they were hou&s;es of lewd re&s;ort<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I once, while I was chairman of the Middle&s;ex &s;e&s;&s;ions, tried an indictment for a riot committed in one of the&s;e coffee-hou&s;es, and in the cour&s;e of the evidence di&s;covered, that it was kept by a woman, a &s;tiff quaker, and was &s;trangely puzzled to re|concile in my mind &s;uch a &s;oleci&s;m in manners as the profe&s;|&s;ion of purity with the practice of lewdne&s;s. She appeared in court in the plain and neat garb of the people of that per&s;ua&s;ion, and was the wife of a &s;eafaring man, who being abroad, had left her to pur&s;ue this lawle&s;s occupation. I reproved her for her cour&s;e of life, but could not make her &s;en&s;ible that it was &s;canda|lons.</NOTE>; and the former oc|cupiers of them, u&s;eful manufacturers and indu&s;trious artificers, were driven to &s;eek el&s;ewhere for a re&s;idence. In the cour&s;e of the entertainments of this place, the manager ventured to exhibit &s;ome few new plays; among the re&s;t a tragedy, intitled, <Q REND="inline">'King Charles the Fir&s;t,'</Q> containing &s;entiments &s;uited to the characters of republicans, &s;ectaries and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and a &s;cenical repre&s;entation of the events of that prince's di&s;a&s;trous reign, better forgotten than remembered. Sober per|&s;ons thought that the revival of the memory of pa&s;t tran&s;actions of &s;uch a kind as the&s;e were, would &s;erve no good purpo&s;e, but, on the contrary, perpetuate that enmity between the friends to and opponents of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, which they
<PB N="74" REF="75">
had heretofore excited; and for &s;uffering &s;uch repre|&s;entations as the&s;e, they execrated not &s;o much the author as the manager. In this in&s;tance, the indigna|tion of the public was ill-directed: the arguments ari&s;ing from this &s;uppo&s;ed abu&s;e of hi&s;trionical liberty were not local; they proved too much, and rather ap|plied to &s;tage entertainments in general than to the conduct of a particular manager.</P>
<P>But others looked on this new-erected theatre with an eye more penetrating: the merchants of London, then a grave &s;agacious body of men, found that it was a temptation to idlene&s;s and to plea&s;ure that their clerks could not re&s;i&s;t: they regretted to &s;ee the corruptions of Covent-garden extended, and the &s;eats of indu&s;try hold forth allurements to vice and debauchery. The principal of the&s;e was Sir John Barnard, a wi&s;e and venerable man, and a good citizen: he, as a magi&s;trate, had for &s;ome time been watching for &s;uch information as would bring the actors at Goodman's-fields play|hou&s;e within the reach of the vagrant laws; but none was laid before him that he could, with prudence, act upon. At length, however, an opportunity offered, which he not only embraced, but made an admirable u&s;e of: Mr. Henry Fielding, then a young barri&s;ter without practice, a dramatic poet, and a patriot, under the extreme pre&s;&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ity, had, in the year 1736, written a comedy, or a farce, we may call it either or both, intitled, <Q REND="inline">'Pa&s;quin,'</Q> a dramatic &s;atire on the times, and brought it on the &s;tage of the little play|hou&s;e in the Hay-market, which, being calculated to encourage popular clamour, and containing in it many reflections on the public councils, furni&s;hed rea&s;ons for bringing a bill into the hou&s;e of commons for prohibit|ing
<PB N="75" REF="76">
the acting of any interlude, tragedy, comedy, opera, play, farce, &amp;c. without the authority of his Maje&s;ty's letters-patent or a licence from the lord-chamberlain. In this bill a clau&s;e was in&s;erted on the motion of Sir John Barnard, and a very judicious one it was, by which it was made penal, even with any &s;uch patent or licence, to act or repre&s;ent any &s;uch interlude, &amp;c. in any part of Great Britain, except in the city of We&s;t|min&s;ter and &s;uch other places as his Maje&s;ty, in per&s;on, &s;hould re&s;ide in.</P>
<P>Before 1737, the year in which this bill was brought in, the property of Goodman's-fields playhou&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed into the hands of Mr. Henry Giffard, who, en|couraged by a &s;ub&s;cription, pulled it down, and, under the direction of Shephard, the architect, the &s;ame that afterwards built Covent-garden theatre, had erected a new one. This man, while the bill was depending, pe|titioned again&s;t it, and, in his printed ca&s;e, repre&s;ented the injury he was likely to &s;u&s;tain: all the &s;pecious ar|guments of the great &s;ums he had expended on the pur|cha&s;e of the hou&s;e, and rebuilding it, in &s;cenes, cloaths, &amp;c. were urged with their utmo&s;t force, and his right to an equivalent &s;tated; but all to no effect: the bill pa&s;&s;ed, and the &s;tatute is now part of the law of the land. It is true, an eva&s;ion of it was afterwards con|trived by an adverti&s;ement of a concert, with a play given gratis, but that &s;ubterfuge was &s;oon aban|doned.</P>
<P>The operation of this &s;tatute was two-fold; it &s;ub|jected theatrical repre&s;entations to a licence, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed a nui&s;ance. And here let me ob&s;erve, that although of plays it is &s;aid that they teach morality, and
<PB N="76" REF="77">
of the &s;tage that it is the mirror of human life, the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are mere declamation, and have no founda|tion in truth or experience: on the contrary, a play|hou&s;e, and the regions about it, are the very hot-beds of vice: how el&s;e comes it to pa&s;s that no &s;ooner is a playhou&s;e opened in any part of the kingdom, than it becomes &s;urrounded by an halo of brothels? Of this truth, the neighbourhood of the place I am now &s;peak|ing of has had experience; one pari&s;h alone, adjacent thereto, having to my knowledge, expended the &s;um of 1300l. in pro&s;ecutions for the purpo&s;e of removing tho&s;e inhabitants, whom, for in&s;truction in the &s;cience of human life, the playhou&s;e had drawn thither.</P>
<P>Mr. Brooke, the author above-mentioned, having with his eyes open, and the &s;tatute of the tenth of George the &s;econd &s;taring him in the face, written a tragedy, in which, as will be pre&s;ently &s;hewn, under pretence of a laudable zeal for the cau&s;e of liberty, he inculcates principles, not only anti-monarchical, but &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent with any &s;y&s;tem of civil &s;ubordina|tion; what wonder is it, that, under a monarchical government, a licence for &s;uch a theatrical repre&s;en|tation &s;hould be refu&s;ed? or that &s;uch a refu&s;al &s;hould be followed by a prohibition of the acting it?</P>
<P>This interpo&s;ition of legal authority was looked upon by the author's friends, in which number were included all the Jacobites in the kingdom, as an in|fraction of a natural right, and as affecting the cau&s;e of liberty. To expre&s;s their re&s;entment of this injury, they advi&s;ed him to &s;end it to the pre&s;s, and by a &s;ub|&s;cription to the publication, of near a thou&s;and per&s;ons, encouraged others to the like attempts. By means of the printed copy any one is enabled to judge of its
<PB N="77" REF="78">
general tendency, and, by reflecting on the &s;entiments inculcated in the following &s;peeches therein to be found, to mea&s;ure the inju&s;tice done him:<Q><L>Is it of fate that he who a&s;&s;umes a crown</L>

<P>The dedication to the play, addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ub|&s;cribers, gives the reader to under&s;tand, that the au|thor had <Q REND="inline">'&s;tudied the ancient laws of his country, though not conver&s;ant with her pre&s;ent political &s;tate,' that he is 'a friend to national liberty and per&s;onal free|dom,' (meaning by the fir&s;t, 'a &s;tate re&s;ulting from virtue or rea&s;on ruling in a brea&s;t &s;uperior to appetite and pa&s;&s;ion,' and, by the la&s;t, 'a &s;ecurity ari&s;ing from the nature of a well-ordered con&s;titution, for tho&s;e ad|vantages

<P>Upon occa&s;ion of this publication, John&s;on was em|ployed by one Corbet, a book&s;eller of &s;mall note, to take up the cau&s;e of this injured author, and he did it in a pamphlet, intitled, <Q REND="inline">'A Compleat Vindication of the Licen&s;ers of the Stage from the malicious and &s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions of Mr. Brooke, author of Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a.'</Q> 4to. 1739.</P>

Did it become a man of his di&s;cern|ment, endowed with &s;uch powers of rea&s;oning and eloquence as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to adopt vulgar preju|dices, or, in the cant of the oppo&s;ition, to clamor again&s;t place-men, and pen&s;ioners and &s;tanding ar|mies? to ridicule the apprehen&s;ion of that inva&s;ion in favour of the pretender, which him&s;elf, but a few years after became a witne&s;s to, or to compare the improbability of &s;uch an event with that of a general in&s;urrection of all who were prohibited the u&s;e of gin?</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">
Of all the modes of &s;atire, I know none &s;o feeble as that of uninterrupted irony. The rea&s;on of this &s;eems to be, that in that kind of writing the author is compelled to advance po&s;itions which no reader can think he believes, and to put que&s;tions that can be an&s;wered in but one way, and that &s;uch an one as thwarts the &s;en&s;e of the propounder. Of this kind of interrogatories the pamphlet I am &s;peaking of &s;eems to be an example; <Q REND="inline">'Is the man without pen&s;ion or place to &s;u&s;pect the impartiality or the judgment of tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of public affairs? Is he, when the law is not &s;trictly ob&s;erved in regard to him, to think him&s;elf aggrieved, to tell his &s;entiments in print, to a&s;&s;ert his claim to better u&s;age, and fly for redre&s;s to another tri|bunal?'</Q></P>
<P>Who does not &s;ee that to the&s;e &s;everal queries the an&s;wer mu&s;t be in the affirmative? and, if &s;o, the point of the writer's wit is, in this in&s;tance, blunted, and his argument baffled.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this mock vindication of power, John&s;on has taken a wide &s;cope, and adopted all the vulgar topics of complaint as they were vented weekly in the public papers, and in the writings of Boling|broke, flim&s;y and malignant as they are. And here let me note a curious &s;ophi&s;m of that &s;uperficial thinker, which I remember to have &s;een in his celebrated Di&s;&s;er|tation on Parties; but which, not having the book by me, I cite by memory: it is to this purpo&s;e: <Q REND="inline">'The advocates of the mini&s;ter,' &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, 'defy us to &s;hew, that, under his admini&s;tration, any infraction had been made of the original contract.'</Q> To this we an&s;wer, that between &s;uch an infraction and the lo&s;s of
<PB N="80" REF="81">
our liberties, there can no point of time intervene; &s;uch a cau&s;e and &s;uch an effect being &s;o clo&s;ely con|nected, that we cannot &s;ee the one till we feel the other.</P>
<P>Such was the conduct of oppo&s;ition at this time, and by &s;uch futile arguments as the above were the &s;illy people of three kingdoms deluded into a belief, that their liberties were in danger, and that nothing could &s;ave this country from impending ruin, and that the mo&s;t formidable of all the evils they had to dread, was the continuance of the then admini&s;tration, of which they had nothing wor&s;e to &s;ay than that they hated it.</P>
<P>The truth is, that John&s;on's political prejudices were a mi&s;t that the eye of his judgment could not penetrate: in all the mea&s;ures of government he could &s;ee nothing right; nor could he be convinced, in his invectives again&s;t a &s;tanding army, as the Jacobites affected to call it, that the pea&s;antry of a country was not an ade|quate defence again&s;t an inva&s;ion of it by an armed force. He almo&s;t a&s;&s;erted in terms, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown had been illegally interrupted, and that from whig-politics none of the benefits of government could be expected. He could but ju&s;t endure the op|po&s;ition to the mini&s;ter becau&s;e conducted on whig principles; and I have heard him &s;ay, that during the whole cour&s;e of it, the two parties were bidding for the people. At other times, and in the heat of his re|&s;entment, I have heard him a&s;&s;ert, that, &s;ince the death of Queen Anne, it had been the policy of the admi|ni&s;tration to promote to eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities none but the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and unde&s;erving men: nor would he then exclude from this bigotted cen&s;ure tho&s;e illu&s;trious divines, Wake, Gib&s;on, Sherlock, Butler, Herring, Pearce, and lea&s;t of all Hoadly;
<PB N="81" REF="82">
in competition with whom he would &s;et Hickes, Brett, Le&s;lie, and others of the nonjurors, who&s;e names are &s;carcely now remembered. From hence it appears, and to his honour be it &s;aid, that his principles co|operated with his nece&s;&s;ities, and that the pro&s;titution of his talents, taking the term in one and that its wor&s;t &s;en&s;e, could not, in ju&s;tice, be imputed to him.</P>
<P>But there is another, and a le&s;s criminal &s;en&s;e of the word pro&s;titution, in which, in common with all who are called authors by profe&s;&s;ion, he may be &s;aid to &s;tand in need of an excu&s;e. When Milton wrote the Para|di&s;e Lo&s;t, the &s;um he received for the copy was not his motive, but was an adventitious benefit that re&s;ulted from the exerci&s;e of his poetical faculty. In John&s;on's ca&s;e, as well in the in&s;tances above given as almo&s;t all the others that occurred during the cour&s;e of his life, the impul&s;e of genius was wanting: had that alone operated in his choice of &s;ubjects to write on, mankind would have been indebted to him for a variety of ori|ginal, intere&s;ting and u&s;eful compo&s;itions; and tran|&s;lations of &s;ome, and new editions of others of the ancient authors.

which John&s;on would never allow; on the contrary, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of my&s;elf who have heard him, and many others, he has frequently declared, that the

only true and genuine motive to the writing of books was the a&s;&s;urance of pecuniary profit. Notwith&s;tanding the boldne&s;s of this a&s;&s;ertion, there are but few that can be per&s;uaded to yield to it; and, after all, the be&s;t apology for John&s;on will be found to con&s;i&s;t in his want of a profe&s;&s;ion, the pre&s;&s;ure of his nece&s;&s;ities, and the example of &s;uch men as Ca&s;talio, Ge&s;ner, and Sal|ma&s;ius, among foreigners; and Fuller, Howel, L'E&s;trange, Dryden, Chambers, and Hume, not to mention others now living, among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The principle here noted was not only in the above in&s;tance avowed by John&s;on, but &s;eems to have been wrought by him into a habit. He was never greedy of money, but without money could not be &s;timu|lated to write. I have been told by a clergyman of &s;ome eminence with whom he had been long ac|quainted, that, being to preach on a particular occa|&s;ion, he applied, as others under a like nece&s;&s;ity had frequently done, to John&s;on for help. <Q REND="inline">'I will write a
<PB N="85" REF="86">
&s;ermon for thee,' &s;aid John&s;on, 'but thou mu&s;t pay me for it.'</Q></P>
<P>Yet was he not &s;o indifferent to the &s;ubjects that he was reque&s;ted to write on, as at any time to abandon either his religious or political principles. He would no more have put his name to an Arian or Socinian tract than to a defence of Athei&s;m. At the time when <Q REND="inline">'Faction Detected'</Q> came out, a pamphlet of which the late lord Egmont is now generally under&s;tood to have been the author, O&s;borne the book&s;eller, held out to him a &s;trong temptation to an&s;wer it, which he refu&s;ed, being convinced, as he a&s;&s;ured me, that the charge contained in it was made good, and that the argument grounded thereon was unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>Indeed whoever peru&s;es that ma&s;terly performance mu&s;t be convinced that a &s;pirit &s;imilar to that which induced the I&s;raelites, when under the conduct of their wi&s;e legi&s;lator, to cry out <Q REND="inline">'Ye take too much upon ye,'</Q> is the mo&s;t frequent motive to oppo&s;ition, and that whoever hopes to govern a free people by rea&s;on, is mi&s;taken in his judgment of human nature. <Q REND="inline">'He,' &s;ays Hooker, 'that goeth about to per&s;uade a people that they are not well governed, &s;hall never want atten|tive and favourable hearers:'</Q>and the &s;ame author &s;peak|ing of legi&s;lation in general, delivers this as his &s;enti|ment: <Q REND="inline">'Laws politic ordained for external order and regimen among&s;t men are never framed as they &s;hould be, unle&s;s pre&s;uming the will of man to be ob&s;tinate, rebellious and aver&s;e from all obedience unto the &s;a|cred laws of his nature: In a word, unle&s;s pre&s;uming man, in regard of his depraved mind, little better than a wild bea&s;t, they do accordingly provide, notwith&s;tand|ing, &s;o to frame his outward actions as that they be no hindrance unto the common good, for which &s;ocieties

<P>That the&s;e were the &s;entiments of John&s;on al&s;o, I am warranted to &s;ay, by frequent declarations to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which I have heard him make; and to the&s;e I attribute it, that he ever after acquie&s;ced in the mea|&s;ures of government through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of admi|ni&s;trations.</P>
<P>It has already been mentioned in the account above given of Savage, that the friends of that ill-&s;tarred man had &s;et on foot a &s;ub&s;cription for his &s;upport, and that Swan&s;ea was the place they had fixed on for his re&s;i|dence: the &s;ame was completed at the end of the year 1739. John&s;on at that time lodged at Greenwich, and there parted with that friend and companion of his midnight rambles, whom it was never his fortune again to &s;ee. The event is antedated in the poem of <Q REND="inline">'Lon|don';</Q> but in every particular, except the difference of a year, what is there &s;aid of the departure of Thales mu&s;t be under&s;tood of Savage, and looked upon as true hi&s;tory. In his life of Savage, John&s;on has mentioned the circum&s;tances that attended it, and deplored this &s;eparation as he would have done a greater misfortune than it proved: that it was, in reality, none, may be inferred from Savage's inability, ari&s;ing from his cir|cum&s;tances, his cour&s;e of life, and the laxity of his mind, to do good to any one: it is rather to be &s;u&s;|pected that his example was contagious, and tended to confirm John&s;on in his indolence and tho&s;e other evil habits which it was the labour of his life to conquer. They who were witne&s;&s;es of John&s;on's per&s;evering temperance in the article of drinking, for, at lea&s;t, the latter half of his life, will &s;carcely believe that, during part of the former, he was a lover of wine, that he not
<PB N="87" REF="88">
only indulged him&s;elf in the u&s;e of it when he could procure it, but, with a reflex delight, contemplated the act of drinking it, with all the circum&s;tances that render it grateful to the palate or plea&s;ing to the eye: in the language of Solomon <Q REND="inline">'he looked upon the wine when it was red, when it gave his colour in the cup, and when it moved it&s;elf aright<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proverbs, chap. xxiii. v. 31.</NOTE>.'</Q> In contradiction to tho&s;e, who, having a wife and children, prefer dome&s;tic enjoyments to tho&s;e which a tavern affords, I have heard him a&s;&s;ert, that a tavern-chair was the throne of human felicity.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'As &s;oon,' &s;aid he, 'as I enter the door of a tavern, I experience an oblivion of care, and a freedom from &s;olicitude<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It is worthy of remark by tho&s;e who are curious in ob&s;erving cu&s;toms and modes of living, how little the&s;e hou&s;es of entertain|ment are now frequented, and what a diminution in their number has been experienced in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter in a period of about forty years backward. The hi&s;tory of taverns in this country may be traced back to the time of Hen. IV. for &s;o ancient is that of the Boar's Head in Ea&s;tcheap, the rendezvous of Prince Henry and his lewd companions, as we learn from Shake&s;peare. Of little le&s;s antiquity is the White Hart without Bi&s;hop's-gate, which now bears in the front of it the date of its erection, 1480.</P>
<P>Anciently there &s;tood in Old Palace-yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter, a tavern known by the &s;ign of the White Ro&s;e, the &s;ymbol of the York faction. It was near the chapel of our Lady behind the high altar of the abbey-church. Together with that chapel it was, in 1503, pulled down, and on the &s;cite of both was erected the chapel of Henry the Seventh. At the re&s;toration, the Cavaliers and other adherents to the royal party, for joy of that event were for a time ince&s;&s;antly drunk; and from a picture of their manners in Cowley's comedy, Cutter of Coleman-&s;treet, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have greatly contributed to the increa&s;e of taverns. When the frenzy of the times was abated, taverns, e&s;pecially tho&s;e about the Exchange, became places for the tran&s;action of almo&s;t all manner of bu&s;i|ne&s;s: there accounts were &s;ettled, conveyances executed, and there attornies &s;at, as at inns in the country on market days, to receive their clients. In that &s;pace near the Royal Exchange which is encompa&s;&s;ed by Lombard, Gracechurch, part of Bi&s;hop's-gate and Threadneedle &s;treets, the number of taverns was not &s;o few as twenty, and on the &s;cite of the Bank there &s;tood four. At the Crown, which was one of them, it was not unu&s;ual in a morning to draw a butt of mountain, a hundred and twenty gallons, in gills.</P></NOTE>: when I am &s;eated, I find the ma&s;ter courteous, and the &s;ervants ob&s;equious to my call; anxious to know and ready to &s;upply my wants: wine there exhilarates my &s;pirits, and prompts me to free conver&s;ation and an interchange of di&s;cour&s;e with tho&s;e whom I mo&s;t love: I dogmati&s;e and am contradicted, and in this conflict of opinions and &s;en|timents I find delight.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="89">
How far his conver&s;ations with Savage might induce him thus to delight in tavern-&s;ociety, which is often a temptation to greater enormities than exce&s;&s;ive drink|ing, cannot now be known, nor would it an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e to enquire. It may, neverthele&s;s, be conjectured, that whatever habits he had contracted of idlene&s;s, neg|lect of his per&s;on, or indifference in the choice of his company, received no correction or check from &s;uch an example as Savage's conduct held forth; and farther it is conjectured, that he would have been le&s;s troubled with tho&s;e reflections, which, in his late&s;t hours, are known to have given him unea&s;ine&s;s, had he never be|come acquainted with one &s;o loo&s;e in his morals, and &s;o well acquainted with the vices of the town as this man appears to have been. We are to remember that John&s;on was, at this time, a hu&s;band: can it therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ociety of &s;uch a man as Savage had any tendency to improve him in the exerci&s;e of the dome&s;tic virtues? nay rather we mu&s;t doubt it, and
<PB N="89" REF="90">
a&s;cribe to an indifference in the di&s;charge of them, ari&s;ing from their nocturnal excur&s;ions, the incident of a temporary &s;eparation of John&s;on from his wife, which &s;oon took place, and that, while he was in a lodging in Fleet &s;treet, &s;he was harboured by a friend near the Tower. It is true that this &s;eparation con|tinued but a &s;hort time, and that if indeed his affection, at that in&s;tant, was alienated from her, it &s;oon returned; for his attachment to her appears, by a variety of notes and memorandums concerning her in books that &s;he was accu&s;tomed to read in, now in my cu&s;tody, to have been equal to what it ought to be: nay Garrick would often ri&s;que offending them both, by mimicking his mode of gallantry and his uxorious behaviour towards her.</P>
<P>The little profit, or indeed reputation, that accrued to John&s;on by the writing of political pamphlets, led him to think of other exerci&s;es for his pen. He had, &s;o early as 1734, &s;olicited employment of Cave; but Cave's corre&s;pondents were &s;o numerous that he had little for him till the beginning of the year 1738, when John&s;on conceived a thought of enriching the Magazine with a biographical article, and wrote for it the Life of Father Paul, an abridgement, as it &s;eems to be, of that life of him which John&s;on intended to have prefixed to his tran&s;lation of the Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent. The motive to this and other exer|tions of the &s;ame talent in the lives of Boerhaave, Blake, Barretier, and other eminent per&s;ons, was his wants, which at one time were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing as to induce him in a letter to Cave, hereinbefore in&s;erted, to intimate to him that he wanted a dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
John&s;on who was never deficient in gratitude, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he received from Cave became his friend; and, what was more in Cave's e&s;timation than any per&s;onal attachment whatever, a friend to his Ma|gazine, for he being at this time engaged in a contro|ver&s;y with a knot of book&s;ellers the proprietors of a rival publication, the London Magazine, John&s;on wrote and addre&s;&s;ed to him the following Ode:<Q><LG TYPE="ode">

<P>The provocation that gave ri&s;e to this furious con|te&s;t, as it will pre&s;ently appear to have been, was the increa&s;ing demand for Cave's publication, and the check it gave to the &s;ale of its rival, which at one time was &s;o great as to throw back no fewer than &s;eventy thou&s;and copies on the hands of the pro|prietors. To revenge this injury, the confederate book&s;ellers gave out, that Sylvanus Urban, whom, for no conceivable rea&s;on, they dignified with the appel|lation of Doctor, was become mad, a&s;&s;igning as the cau&s;e of his in&s;anity, his publication in the Magazine of &s;undry mathematical problems, e&s;&s;ays and que&s;tions on ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects, &s;ent him by many of his learned corre&s;pondents. Cave who for &s;ome months had been rebutting the calumnies of his adver&s;aries, and that with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as provoked them to the outrage above-mentioned, now felt that he had them at mercy. With that &s;agacity which we frequently ob&s;erve, but wonder at in men of &s;low parts, he &s;eemed to antici|pate
<PB N="93" REF="94">
the advice contained in the &s;econd and third &s;tanzas of John&s;on's ode, and forbore a reply, though not his revenge, which he gratified in &s;uch a manner as &s;eems to ab&s;olve him from the guilt im|putable in mo&s;t ca&s;es to that pa&s;&s;ion; this he did by in&s;erting as an article of public intelligence in his Hi&s;torical Chronicle for the month of February 1738, the following paragraph: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Monday 20. About 8 o'clock the famous Dr. Urban, having &s;ome time pa&s;t been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a violent frenzy, broke loo&s;e from his nur&s;e, and run all through the &s;treets of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter di&s;tributing quack bills, &s;wearing he would go vi&s;it his beautiful <HI>Garden of Eden;</HI> raving again&s;t <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A party paper &s;o intitled.</NOTE>, and the London Magazine, and &s;inging a mad &s;ong &s;et to mu&s;ic by Peter the Wild Youth; but being at la&s;t &s;ecured, was conveyed to his lodgings in Moor|fields, where he continues uttering horrid impreca|tions again&s;t &s;everal book&s;ellers and printers. 'Tis thought this <HI>poor</HI> man's misfortune is owing to his having lately perplexed him&s;elf with <HI>biblical que&s;tions, mathematical problems, a&s;tronomical equations, and</HI> methods to find the longitude."</Q><Q REND="inline">&mdash;'<HI>This &s;illy para|graph, and &s;uch like buffoonery, in&s;erted in the news|papers at the charge of the proprietors of the</HI> London Magazine, <HI>is all the an&s;wer given to the remarks on their inimitable preface, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of which are quoted in the beginning of this magazine</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of many years ob&s;ervation I am able to re|collect one, and only one, in&s;tance of this method of treating a &s;currilous adver&s;ary. An ingenious mechanic, of the name of New&s;ham, who with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the late Dr. Defaguliers, had made many con&s;iderable improvements in the con&s;truction of engines for extingui&s;hing fires, had obtained a patent for one in particular which conjoined in one and the &s;ame machine the active powers of both the hands and feet: an ignorant and im|pudent pretender invaded his right, and the more to exa&s;perate him, wrote with his own hand and &s;ub&s;cribed a letter to Mr. New&s;ham, made up of the foule&s;t abu&s;e and a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the principles of mechanics in language, which for its non&s;en&s;e and bad &s;pelling conveyed no ideas. Mr. New&s;ham printed and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome thou&s;and copies verbatim et literatim of this letter, and without a &s;ingle remark thereon &s;unk the reputation of his adver&s;ary &s;o low as ever after to be irretrieyable.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="95">
The publication in the manner above-mentioned of this &s;en&s;ele&s;s and malignant fiction, and the care and attention of Cave in the compilation of his maga|zine, together with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he received from a variety of ingenious and learned corre&s;pondents, ena|bled him in a &s;hort time to triumph over his rivals, and increa&s;ed the &s;ale thereof to a number that no other could ever equal.</P>
<P>It was no part of Cave's original de&s;ign to give the debates in either hou&s;e of parliament, but the oppo&s;i|tion to the mini&s;ter, and the &s;pirit that conducted it, had excited in the people a great eagerne&s;s to know what was going forward in both, and he knew that to gratify that de&s;ire was to encrea&s;e the demand for his pamphlet. Indeed the experiment had already been made, for the &s;peeches in parliament had for &s;ome time been given in the Political State of Great Britain, a publication above &s;poken of, and though drawn up by per&s;ons no way equal to &s;uch an undertaking, were well received. The&s;e for the mo&s;t part were taken by &s;tealth, and were compiled from the information of li&s;teners and the under-officers and door-keepers of either hou&s;e; but Cave had an intere&s;t
<PB N="95" REF="96">
with &s;ome of the members of both, ari&s;ing from an employment he held in the po&s;t-office, that of in&s;pector of the franks, which not only gave him the privilege of &s;ending his letters free of po&s;tage, but an acquaintance with, and occa&s;ions of acce&s;s to many of them.</P>
<P>Of this advantage he was too good a judge of his own intere&s;t not to avail him&s;elf. He therefore de|termined to gratify his readers with as much of this kind of intelligence as he could procure and it was &s;afe to communicate: his re&s;olution was to frequent the two hou&s;es whenever an important debate was likely to come on, and from &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions and par|ticulars in the cour&s;e thereof as could be collected and retained in memory, to give the arguments on either &s;ide. This re&s;olution he put into practice in July 1736. His method of proceeding is variou&s;ly reported; but I have been informed by &s;ome who were much about him, that taking with him a friend or two, he found means to procure for them and him&s;elf admi&s;&s;ion into the gallery of the hou&s;e of commons, or to &s;ome con|cealed &s;tation in the other, and that then they pri|vately took down notes of the &s;everal &s;peeches, and the general tendency and &s;ub&s;tance of the arguments, Thus furni&s;hed, Cave and his a&s;&s;ociates would adjourn to a neighbouring tavern, and compare and adju&s;t their notes, by means whereof and the help of their memo|ries, they became enabled to fix at lea&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance of what they had &s;o lately heard and remarked.</P>
<P>The reducing this crude matter into form, was the work of a future day and of an abler hand, viz. Guthrie, the hi&s;torian, a writer for the book&s;ellers, whom Cave retained for the purpo&s;e: the &s;peeches thus compo&s;ed were given monthly to the public,
<PB N="96" REF="97">
and peru&s;ed and red with great eagerne&s;s; tho&s;e who contemplated them thought they di&s;covered in them not merely the political principles, but the &s;tile and manner of the &s;peaker; the fact is, that there was little di&s;crimination of the latter between the &s;peeches of the be&s;t and the wor&s;t orators in either a&s;&s;embly, and in mo&s;t in&s;tances the per&s;ons to whom they were a&s;cribed were here made to &s;peak with more eloquence and even propriety of diction than, in the place of de|bate they were able to do: Sir John Barnard, for in&s;tance, a man of no learning or reading, and who by the way had been bred a quaker, had a &s;tile little better than an ordinary mechanic, and which abounded with &s;uch phra&s;es as, if &s;o be&mdash;&s;et ca&s;e&mdash;and&mdash;nobody more &s;o&mdash;and other &s;uch vulgari&s;ms, yet was he made in the magazine to debate in language as correct and poli&s;hed as that of Sir William Wyndham or Mr. Pulteney; though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that &s;o weighty was his matter on &s;ubjects of commerce, that Sir Robert Walpole, as I have been credibly informed, was u&s;ed to &s;ay, that when he had an&s;wered Sir John Bar|nard, he looked upon that day's bu&s;ine&s;s in the hou&s;e of commons to be as good as over.</P>
<P>The vigorous oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;ter, and the motion in both hou&s;es of the thirteenth of February, 1740-1 to remove him, were a new aera in politics; and, as the debates on that occa&s;ion were warmer than had ever then been known, the drawing them up re|quired, in Cave's opinion, the pen of a more nervous writer than he who had hitherto conducted them. John&s;on, who in his former publications in pro&s;e, had given no very favorable &s;pecimens of &s;tile, had by this time, by the &s;tudy of the be&s;t of our old Engli&s;h
<PB N="97" REF="98">
writers, &s;uch as Sir Thomas More, A&s;cham, Hooker, Spen&s;er, archbi&s;hop Sandys, Jewel, Chillingworth, Hales, of Eton, and others, formed a new one, con&s;i&s;ting in original phra&s;es and new combinations of the integral parts of &s;entences, which, with the infu&s;ion of words derived from the Latin and accommodated to our idiom, were &s;uch an improvement of the language as greatly tended to enrich it: Cave therefore thought him a fit per&s;on to conduct this part of his monthly publication, and, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Guthrie, committed the care of it to John&s;on.</P>
<P>Before this change of hands, Cave had been checked by &s;ome intimations from the clerks of the hou&s;e of commons, that his printing the debates had given offence to the &s;peaker, and might &s;ubject him to cen&s;ure: this he, for &s;ome time, regard|ed but little, relying po&s;&s;ibly upon the indulgence that had been &s;hewn as well to the publi&s;hers of the Political State of Great Britain, who were the fir&s;t that ventured on this practice, as to him&s;elf; but a re&s;olution of the hou&s;e at length gave him to under|&s;tand, that it would be prudence in him to de&s;i&s;t from it. The thought of putting his readers on &s;hort allowance was very unplea&s;ing to him, and this, with the apprehen&s;ion that the &s;ale of his Magazine might be affected by the omi&s;&s;ion of a kind of intelligence which they had been accu&s;tomed to, drove him to many contrivances to evade the prohibition, out of which he cho&s;e one that &s;carce any man but him&s;elf would have thought of: it was the giving to the pub|lic the debates in the Briti&s;h &s;enate under a fictitious de&s;ignation. Every one, he knew, was acquainted with Gulliver's Travels; he therefore, in his magazine
<PB N="98" REF="99">
for June 1738, begins the month by feigning, that the debates in the &s;enate of Magna Lilliputia were then extant; and referring to the re&s;olution of the hou&s;e of commons, above-mentioned, whereby he was for|bidden to in&s;ert any account of the proceedings of the Briti&s;h parliament, he pretends to doubt not but his readers will be plea&s;ed with the in&s;ertion of what he calls the appendix to captain Gulliver's account of Lilliput, in their room. A change of fictitious for real names of per&s;ons, countries, and provinces, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the carrying on this de&s;ign, and accordingly, by tran&s;po&s;ing the letters and otherwi&s;e anagrammatizing proper names, he has, through the medium of non&s;en&s;e, given light to that which he would be thought to conceal.</P>
<P>Farther to aid his reader as to the names of coun|tries, &amp;c. he publi&s;hed, at the end of his magazine for 1738, a fictitious propo&s;al for printing, by &s;ub|&s;cription, a work, intitled, Anagrammata Rediviva, or the art of compo&s;ing and re&s;olving anagrams, with a reference to the book&s;ellers, agents, and ma&s;ters of &s;hips, in the cities, countries, and provinces therein de&s;cribed by barbarous names oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e which they are meant to &s;ignify: he al&s;o, at the end of the magazines for 1739, 1740, 1741, 1742, and 1743, gave a li&s;t of chri&s;tian and &s;urnames pretendedly &s;ynonimous, forming thereby a key to that otherwi&s;e unintelligible jargon which Cave, by this &s;ubterfuge, had introduced into the debates.</P>
<P>The proprietors of the London Magazine, who al&s;o gave the debates, but from documents le&s;s authentic than tho&s;e of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ve, compelled by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="99" REF="100">
that forced him to this artifice, took another cour&s;e: they feigned to give the debates in the Roman &s;enate, and by adapting Roman names to the &s;everal &s;peeches, rendered them more plau&s;ible than they appear under Cave's management.</P>
<P>The artifice however &s;ucceeded in both in&s;tances: the re&s;olution of the commons was never enforced, and the debates were publi&s;hed with impunity. I will not di&s;grace my page by the in&s;ertion of any of tho&s;e barbarous appellations which Cave had invented, and which, I dare &s;ay, were mu&s;ic to his ear; but content my&s;elf with &s;aying, that Guthrie acquie&s;ced in Cave's fiction and the non&s;en&s;e which it involved, and as it was found to an&s;wer its end, John&s;on &s;crupled not to adopt it.</P>
<P>The debates penned by John&s;on were not only more methodical and better connected than tho&s;e of Guthrie, but in all the ornaments of &s;tile &s;uperior: they were written at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons when he was able to rai&s;e his imagination to &s;uch a pitch of &s;ervour as bordered upon enthu&s;ia&s;m, which, that he might the better do, his practice was to &s;hut him&s;elf up in a room a&s;&s;igned him at St. John's gate, to which he would not &s;uffer any one to approach, except the compo&s;itor or Cave's boy for matter, which, as fa&s;t as he compo&s;ed it, he tumbled out at the door.</P>
<P>Never were the force of rea&s;oning or the powers of popular eloquence more evidently di&s;played, or the arts of &s;ophi&s;try more clearly detected than in the&s;e animated compo&s;itions. Nor are they more worthy of admiration for the&s;e their excellencies than for that peculiarity of language which di&s;criminates
<PB N="100" REF="101">
the debates of each a&s;&s;embly from the other, and the various colouring which he has found the art of giv|ing to particular &s;peeches. The characteri&s;tic of the one a&s;&s;embly we know is Dignity; the privilege of the other Freedom of Expre&s;&s;ion. To &s;peak of the fir&s;t, when a member thereof endowed with wi&s;dom, gravity, and experience, is made to ri&s;e, the &s;tile which John&s;on gives him is nervous, his matter weighty, and his arguments convincing; and when a mere popular orator takes up a debate, his elo|quence is by him repre&s;ented in a glare of fal&s;e rheto|ric, &s;pecious rea&s;oning, an affectation of wit, and a di&s;po&s;ition to trifle with &s;ubjects the mo&s;t intere&s;ting. With great judgment al&s;o does John&s;on adopt the unre&s;trained oratory of the other hou&s;e, and with equal facility imitate the deep-mouthed rancour of Pulteney, and the yelping pertinacity of Pitt.</P>
<P>As an illu&s;tration of the former part of this po&s;ition, I &s;hall here give two &s;peeches, the one of the lord|chancellor Hardwicke on the motion of lord Car|teret for an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, be&s;eeching him to remove Sir Robert Walpole from his pre&s;ence and councils for ever; and the other of lord Che&s;terfield on a bill, intitled <Q REND="inline">'An act for repealing certain duties on &s;pirituous liquors, and on licences for retailing the &s;ame, and for laying other duties on &s;pirituous liquors and on licen&s;es for retailing the &s;aid liquors.'</Q> That of lord Hardwicke is as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102"><Q REND="inline"><P>'My Lords,</P><P>'Though I very readily admit that crimes ought to be puni&s;hed, that a treacherous admini&s;tration of public affairs is in a very high degree criminal, that even ignorance, where it is the con&s;equence of neglect, de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t animadver&s;ion, and that it is the privilege and duty of this hou&s;e to watch over the &s;tate of the nation, and inform his Maje&s;ty of any errors committed by his mini&s;ters; yet I am far from being convinced either of the ju&s;tice or nece&s;&s;ity of the motion now under con&s;i|deration.</P><P>'The mo&s;t flagrant and invidious part of the charge again&s;t the right honourable gentleman appears to con&s;i&s;t in this, that he has engro&s;&s;ed an exorbitant degree of power, and u&s;urped an unlimited influence over the whole &s;y&s;tem of government, that he di&s;|po&s;es of all honours and preferments, and that he is not only fir&s;t but &s;ole mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>'But of this boundle&s;s u&s;urpation, my lords, what proof has been laid before you? what beyond loud exaggerations, pompous rhetoric, and &s;pecious appeals to common fame? common fame which at lea&s;t may &s;ometimes err, and which though it may afford &s;ufficient ground for &s;u&s;picion and enquiry, was never yet admitted as conclu&s;ive evidence, where the immediate nece&s;&s;ities of the public did not preclude the common forms of examination, where the power of the offender did not make it dangerous to attack him by a legal pro&s;ecution, or where the conduct of the accu&s;er did not plainly
<PB N="102" REF="103">
di&s;cover that they were more eager of blood than of ju&s;tice, and more &s;olicitous to de&s;troy than to con|vict.</P>
<P>'I hope none of the&s;e circum&s;tances, my lords, can at pre&s;ent ob&s;truct a candid and deliberate en|quiry; with regard to the public, I am not able to di&s;cover any pre&s;&s;ing exigences that demand a more compendious method of proceeding than the e&s;tab|li&s;hed laws of the land and the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors have pre&s;cribed. I know not any calamity that will be aggravated, nor any danger that will become more formidable by &s;uffering this que&s;tion to be legally tried.</P>
<P>'Nor is there, my lords, in the circum&s;tances of the per&s;on accu&s;ed, any thing that can incite us to a ha&s;ty proce&s;s, for if what is alledged by the noble lords is not exaggerated beyond the truth, if he is univer&s;ally dete&s;ted by the whole nation, and loaded with execrations by the public voice, if he is con&s;i|dered as the author of all our mi&s;eries and the &s;ource of all our corruptions, if he has ruined our trade and depre&s;&s;ed our power, impoveri&s;hed the people and attempted to en&s;lave them, there is at lea&s;t no danger of an in&s;urrection in his favour, or any probability that his party will grow &s;tronger by delays. For, my lords, to find friends in adver&s;ity and a&s;&s;ertors in di&s;tre&s;s, is only the prerogative of innocence and virtue.</P>
<P>'The gentleman again&s;t whom this formidable charge is drawn up, is, I think, not &s;u&s;pected of any intention to have recour&s;e either to force or flight: he has always appeared willing to be tried by the laws of his country, and to &s;tand an impartial ex|amination;
<PB N="103" REF="104">
he neither oppo&s;es nor eludes enquiry, neither flies from ju&s;tice nor defies it.</P>
<P>'And yet le&s;s, my lords, can I &s;u&s;pect, that tho&s;e by whom he is accu&s;ed act from any motive that may influence them to de&s;ire a &s;entence not &s;upported by evidence or conformable to truth, or that they can wi&s;h the ruin of any man who&s;e crimes are not no|torious and flagrant, that they per&s;ecute from pri|vate malice, or endeavour to exalt them&s;elves by the fall of another.</P>
<P>'Let us therefore, my lords, enquire before we determine, and &s;uffer evidence to precede our &s;en|tence. The charge, if it is ju&s;t, mu&s;t be by its own nature ea&s;ily proved, and that no proof is brought may perhaps be &s;ufficient to make us &s;u&s;pect that it is not ju&s;t.</P>
<P>'For, my lords, what is the evidence of common fame, which has been &s;o much exalted and &s;o confi|dently produced? Does not every man &s;ee, that on &s;uch occa&s;ions two que&s;tions may be a&s;ked, of which perhaps neither can ea&s;ily be an&s;wered, and which yet mu&s;t both be re&s;olved before common fame can be admitted as a proof of facts?</P>
<P>'It is fir&s;t to be enquired, my lords, whether the reports of fame are nece&s;&s;arily or even probably true. A que&s;tion very intricate and diffu&s;ive, entangled with a thou&s;and and involving a thou&s;and di&s;tincti|ons:&mdash;a que&s;tion, of which it may be &s;aid, that a man may very plau&s;ibly maintain either &s;ide, and of which, perhaps, after months or years wa&s;ted in di&s;|putation, no other deci&s;ion can be obtained than what is obvious at the fir&s;t view, that they are often true and often fal&s;e, and therefore can only
<PB N="104" REF="105">
be grounds of enquiry, not rea&s;ons of determina|tion.</P>
<P>'But if it appear, my lords, that this oracle cannot be deceived, we are then to enquire after another difficulty, we are to enquire, What is fame?</P>
<P>'Is fame, my lords, that fame which cannot err, a report that flies on a &s;udden through a nation, of which no man can di&s;cover the original? a &s;udden bla&s;t of rumour that inflames or intimidates a peo|ple, and obtains, without authority, a general credit? No man ver&s;ed in hi&s;tory can enquire whether &s;uch reports may not deceive. Is fame rather a &s;ettled opinion prevailing by degrees, and for &s;ome time e&s;ta|bli&s;hed? How long then, my lords, and in what de|gree mu&s;t it have been e&s;tabli&s;hed to obtain un|doubted credit? and when does it commence infalli|ble? If the people are divided in their opinions, as in all public que&s;tions it has hitherto happened, fame is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the voice of the majority. For if the two parties are equal in their numbers, fame will be equal, then how great mu&s;t be the majority before it can lay claim to this powerful auxiliary? and how &s;hall that majority be numbered?</P>
<P>'The&s;e que&s;tions, my lords, may be thought, per|haps with ju&s;tice, too ludicrous in this place; but in my opinion they contribute to &s;hew the precarious and uncertain nature of the evidence &s;o much con|fided in.</P>
<P>'Common fame, my lords, is to every man only what he him&s;elf commonly hears, and it is in the power of any man's acquaintance to vitiate the evi|dence which they report, and to &s;tun him with cla|mours, and terrify him with apprehen&s;ions of mi&s;eries never felt, and dangers invi&s;ible.</P>

'But without &s;uch a combination, we are to remember that mo&s;t men a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e of their own opi|nions, and that the rank of tho&s;e that compo&s;e this a&s;&s;embly naturally di&s;po&s;es &s;uch as are admitted to their company, to relate or to invent &s;uch reports as may be favourably received, &s;o that what appears to one lord the general voice of common fame, may by another be thought only the murmur of a petty faction, de&s;picable with regard to their numbers, and dete&s;table if we con&s;ider their principles.</P>
<P>'So difficult is it, my lords, to form any &s;olid judg|ment concerning the extent and prevalence of any particular report, and the degree of credit to be given to it. The indu&s;try of a party may &s;upply the defect of numbers, and &s;ome concurrent circum&s;tances may contribute to give credit to a fal&s;e report.</P>
<P>'But, my lords, we are our&s;elves appealed to as witne&s;&s;es of the truth of facts which prove him to be &s;ole mini&s;ter, of the number of his dependants, the advancement of his friends, the di&s;appointments of his opponents, and the declarations made by his followers of adherence and fidelity.</P>
<P>'If it &s;hould be granted, my lords, that there is no|thing in the&s;e repre&s;entations exaggerated beyond the truth, and that nothing is repre&s;ented in an improper light, what con&s;equence can we draw but that the fol|lowers of this gentleman make u&s;e of tho&s;e arts which have always been practi&s;ed by the candidates of pre|ferment; that they endeavour to gain their patron's &s;mile by flattery and panegyric, and to keep it by a&s;&s;iduity and an appearance of gratitude? And if &s;uch applications exalted any man to the authority and title of fir&s;t mini&s;ter, the nation has never, in my

memory, been without &s;ome man in that &s;tation, for there is always &s;ome one to whom ambition and avarice have paid their court, and who&s;e regards have been purcha&s;ed at the expence of truth.</P>
<P>'Nor is it to be wondered at, my lords, that po&s;ts of honour and profit have been be&s;towed upon the friends of the admini&s;tration, for who enriches or exalts his enemies? Who will encrea&s;e the in|fluence that is to be exerted again&s;t him, or add &s;trength to the blow that is levelled at him&s;elf?</P>
<P>'That the right honourable gentleman is the only di&s;po&s;er of honours has never yet appeared; it is not pretended, my lords, that he di&s;tributes them without the con&s;ent of his Maje&s;ty, nor even that his recommendation is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of any man's applications. If he has gained more of his Maje&s;ty's confidence and e&s;teem than any other of his &s;ervants, he has done only what every man endeavours, and what therefore is not to be imputed to him as a crime.</P>
<P>'It is impo&s;&s;ible, my lords, that Kings like other men &s;hould not have particular motions of inclina|tion or di&s;like; it is po&s;&s;ible that they may fix their affection upon objects not in the highe&s;t degree worthy of their regard, and overlook others that may boa&s;t of greater excellencies and more &s;hining merit, but this is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed without proof, and the regard of the King as of any other man, is one argument of de&s;ert more than he can produce who has endeavoured after it without effect.</P>
<P>'This imputed u&s;urpation mu&s;t be proved upon him either by his own confe&s;&s;ion or by the evidence of others, and it has not yet been pretended that he

a&s;&s;umes the title of Prime Mini&s;ter, or indeed that it is applied to him by any but his enemies, and it may ea&s;ily be conceived how weakly the mo&s;t un|corrupted innocence would be &s;upported if all the a&s;per&s;ions of its enemies were to be received as proofs again&s;t it.</P>
<P>'Nor does it appear, my lords, that any other evi|dence can be brought again&s;t him on this head, or that any man will &s;tand forth and affirm, that either he has been injured him&s;elf by this gentleman, or known any injury done by him to another by the exertion of authority with which he was not lawfully inve&s;ted; &s;uch evidence, my lords, the laws of our country require to be produced before any man can be puni&s;hed, cen&s;ured or di&s;graced. No man is obliged to prove his innocence, but may call upon his pro&s;ecutors to &s;upport their accu&s;ation, and why this honourable gentleman, whatever may have been his conduct, &s;hould be treated in a different manner than any other criminal, I am by no means able to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>'Though there has been no evidence offered of his guilt, your lord&s;hips have heard an atte&s;tation of his innocence from the noble Nardac<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Duke.</NOTE> who &s;poke fir&s;t again&s;t the motion, of whom it cannot be &s;u&s;|pected that he would voluntarily engage to an&s;wer for mea&s;ures which he pur&s;ued in blind compliance with the direction of another.

'In every government, my lords, as in every family, &s;ome, either by accident, or a natural indu&s;try, or a &s;uperior capacity, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, will be en|gaged in more bu&s;ine&s;s and treated with more con|fidence than others; but if every man is willing to an&s;wer for the conduct of his own province, there is all the &s;ecurity again&s;t corruption that can po&s;&s;ibly be obtained; for if every man's regard to his own &s;afety and reputation will prevent him from betraying his tru&s;t or abu&s;ing his power, much more will it incite him to prevent any mi&s;conduct in another for which he mu&s;t him&s;elf be accountable. Men are u&s;ually &s;ufficiently tenacious of power, and ready to vindicate their &s;eparate rights, when nothing but their pride is affected by the u&s;urpation, but &s;urely no man will patiently &s;uffer his province to be invaded, when he may him&s;elf be ruined by the conduct of the invader.</P>
<P>'Thus, my lords, it appears to me to be not only without proof, but without probability, and the fir&s;t mini&s;ter can, in my opinion, be nothing more than a formidable illu&s;ion, which, when one man thinks he has &s;een it, he &s;hews to another as ea&s;ily frighted as him&s;elf, who joins with him in propagating the no|tion, and in &s;preading terror and re&s;entment over the nation, till at la&s;t the panic becomes general, and what was at fir&s;t only whi&s;pered by malice or preju|dice in the ears of ignorance or credulity, is adopted by common fame, and echoed back from the people to the &s;enate.</P>
<P>'I have hitherto, my lords, confined my&s;elf to the con&s;ideration of one &s;ingle article of this complicated charge, becau&s;e it appears to me to be the only part
<PB N="109" REF="110">
of it nece&s;&s;ary to be examined, for if once it be ac|knowledged that the affairs of the nation are tran&s;act|ed, not by the mini&s;ter but the admini&s;tration, by the council, in which every man who &s;its there has an equal voice and equal authority, the blame or prai&s;e of all the mea&s;ures mu&s;t be transferred from him to the council, and every man that has advi&s;ed or con|curred in them, will de&s;erve the &s;ame cen&s;ure or the &s;ame applau&s;e; as it is unju&s;t to puni&s;h one man for the crimes of another, it is unju&s;t to chu&s;e one man out for puni&s;hment from among many others equally guilty.</P>
<P>'But I doubt not, my lords, when all tho&s;e mea&s;ures are equitably con&s;idered, there will be no puni&s;h|ni&s;hment to be dreaded, becau&s;e neither negligence nor treachery will be di&s;covered. For, my lords, with regard to the treaty of Vinena<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vienna.</NOTE>, let us &s;uppo&s;e our mini&s;ters deceived by ignorant or corrupt in|telligence; let us admit that they were cautious where there was no danger, and neglected &s;ome op|portunities which, if they had received better infor|mation, they might have improved to the advantage and &s;ecurity of the nation: what have they done even under all the&s;e di&s;advantageous &s;uppo&s;itions, but followed the lights which they judged mo&s;t clear, and by which they hoped to be conducted to honour and to &s;afety?</P>
<P>'Policy, my lords, is very different from pre&s;cience, the utmo&s;t that can be attained is probability, and that, for the mo&s;t part, in a low degree. It is ob|&s;erved that no man is wi&s;e, but as you take into con&s;ideration the weakne&s;s of another; a maxim more eminently true of political wi&s;dom, which
<PB N="110" REF="111">
con&s;i&s;ts very often only in di&s;covering de&s;igns which could never be known but by the folly or treachery of tho&s;e to whom they are tru&s;ted. If our enemies were wi&s;e enough to keep their own &s;ecrets, neither our mini&s;ters nor our patriots would be able to know or prevent their de&s;igns, nor would it be any reproach to their &s;agacity that they did not know what nobody would tell them.</P>
<P>'If therefore, my lords, the princes who&s;e intere&s;t is contrary to our own, have been at any time &s;erved by hone&s;t and wi&s;e men, there was a time when our mini&s;ters could act only by conjecture, and might be mi&s;taken without a crime.</P>
<P>'If it was always in our power to penetrate into the intentions of our enemies, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have the &s;ame means of making them&s;elves acquaint|ed with our projects, and yet, when any of them are di&s;covered, we think it ju&s;t to impute it to the negli|gence of the mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>'Thus, my lords, every man is inclined to judge with prejudice and partiality. When we &s;uffer by the prudence of our enemies, we charge our mini&s;ters with want of vigilance, without con&s;idering that very often nothing is nece&s;&s;ary to clude the mo&s;t pene|trating &s;agacity but ob&s;tinate &s;ilence.</P>
<P>'If we enquire into the tran&s;actions of pa&s;t times, &s;hall we find any man, however renowned for his abi|lities, not &s;ometimes impo&s;ed upon by fal&s;hoods, and &s;ometimes betrayed by his own rea&s;onings into mea|&s;ures de&s;tructive of the purpo&s;es which he endeavoured to promore?

<P>'Clewmro, my lords, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be hur|ried away by the near pro&s;pect of pre&s;ent advantages, and the apprehen&s;ion of pre&s;ent dangers, and every other man has been in the &s;ame manner &s;ometimes deluded into a preference of &s;maller pre&s;ent advan|tage to a greater which was more remote.</P>
<P>'Let it not be urged, my lords, that politics are advanced &s;ince the time of Clewmro, and that errors which might then be committed by the wi&s;e&s;t ad|mini&s;tration, are now gro&s;s and reproachful: we are to remember that every part of policy has been equally improved, and that, if more methods of di&s;covery have been &s;truck out, there have been likewi&s;e more arts invented of eluding it.</P>
<P>'When therefore we enquire into the conduct, or ex|amine the abilities of a mini&s;ter, we are not to expect that he &s;hould appear never to have been deceived, but that he &s;hould never be found to have neglected any proper means of information, nor ever to have willingly given up the intere&s;t of his country; but we are not to impute to his weakne&s;s what is only to be a&s;cribed to the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e whom he oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>'If this plea, my lords, is rea&s;onable, it will be

nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who &s;upport the motion, to prove, not only that the treaty of Vinena was never made, but that the fal&s;hood of the report either was or might have been known by our mini&s;ters, otherwi&s;e tho&s;e who are inclined to retain a favourable opinion of their integrity and abilities, may conclude, that they were either not mi&s;taken, or were led into error by &s;uch delu&s;ions as would no le&s;s ea&s;ily have impo&s;|ed on their accu&s;ers, and that by exalting their ene|mies to their &s;tations they &s;hall not much con&s;ult the advantage of their country.</P>

<P>This nervous &s;peech was occa&s;ioned by one of the earl of Abingdon in &s;upport of the motion, which he grounded on the evidence of common fame.

<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'My Lords,</P><P>'The bill now under our con&s;ideration appears to me to de&s;erve a much clo&s;er regard than &s;eems to have been paid to it in the other hou&s;e, through which it was hurried with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and where it pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t without the formality of a debate; nor can I think that earne&s;tne&s;s with which &s;ome lords &s;eem inclined to pre&s;s it forward here, con&s;i&s;tent with the importance of the con&s;equences which may be, with great rea&s;on, expected from it.</P><P>'It has been urged that where &s;o great a number have formed expectations of a national benefit from any bill, &s;o much deference at lea&s;t is due to their judgment, as that the bill &s;hould be con&s;idered in a committee. This, my lords, I admit to be, in other ca&s;es, a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable demand, and will readily
<PB N="114" REF="115">
allow that the propo&s;al, not only of a con&s;iderable number, but even of any &s;ingle lord, ought to be fully examined and regularly debated, according to the u&s;ual forms of this a&s;&s;embly. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, my lords, and in all ca&s;es like the pre&s;ent, the de|mand is improper becau&s;e it is u&s;ele&s;s, and it is u&s;ele&s;s becau&s;e we can do now all that we can do hereafter in a committee. For the bill before us is a money-bill, which, according to the pre&s;ent opinion of the clinabs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commons.</NOTE>, we have no right to amend, and which therefore we have no need of con&s;idering in a committee, &s;ince the event of all our deliberations mu&s;t be, that we are either to reject or pa&s;s it in its pre&s;ent &s;tate; for I &s;uppo&s;e no lord will think this a proper time to enter into a controver&s;y with the clinabs for the revival of tho&s;e privileges to which, I be|lieve, we have a right, and &s;uch a controver&s;y, the lea&s;t attempt to amend a money-bill will certainly produce.</P>
<P>'To de&s;ire, therefore, my lords, that this bill may be con&s;idered in a committee, is only to de&s;ire that it may gain one &s;tep without oppo&s;ition, that it may proceed through the forms of the hou&s;e by &s;tealth, and that the con&s;ideration of it may be delayed till the exigencies of the government &s;hall be &s;o great, as not to allow time for rai&s;ing the &s;upplies by any other method.</P>
<P>'By this artifice, gro&s;s as it is, the patrons of this wonderful bill hope to ob&s;truct a plain and open detection of its tendency. They hope, my lords, that the bill &s;hall operate in the &s;ame manner with the liquor which it is intended to bring into more general u&s;e; and that as tho&s;e that drink &s;pirits are
<PB N="115" REF="116">
drunk before they are well aware that they are drinking, the effects of this law &s;hall be perceived, before we know that we have made it. Their intent is to give us a dram of policy which is to be &s;wal|lowed before it is ta&s;ted, and which, when once it is &s;wallowed, will turn our heads.</P>
<P>'But, my lords, I hope we &s;hall be &s;o cautious as to examine the draught which the&s;e &s;tate-em|pirics have thought proper to offer us, and I am confident that a very little examination will con|vince us of the pernicious qualities of their new preparation, and &s;hew that it can have no other effect than that of poi&s;oning the public.</P>
<P>'The law before us, my lords, &s;eems to be the effect of that practice of which it is intended like|wi&s;e to be the cau&s;e, and to be dictated by the liquor of which it &s;o effectually promotes the u&s;e, for &s;urely it never before was conceived by any man intru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of public affairs, to rai&s;e taxes by the de&s;truction of the people.</P>
<P>'Nothing, my lords, but the de&s;truction of all the mo&s;t laborious and u&s;eful part of the nation, can be expected from the licen&s;e which is now propo&s;ed to be given, not only to drunkenne&s;s, but to drunken|ne&s;s of the mo&s;t dete&s;table and dangerous kind, to the abu&s;e not only of intoxicating but of poi&s;onous liquors.</P>
<P>'Nothing, my lords, is more ab&s;urd than to a&s;&s;ert, that the u&s;e of &s;pirits will be hindered by the bill now before us, or indeed that it will not be in a very great degree promoted by it. For what produces all kind of wickedne&s;s but the pro&s;pect of impunity on one part, or the &s;olicitation of opportunity on

the other? Either of the&s;e have too frequently been &s;ufficient to overpower the &s;en&s;e of morality, and even of religion, and what is not to be feared from them when they &s;hall unite their force, and operate together, when temptations &s;hall be increa&s;ed and terror taken away?</P>
<P>'It is allowed by tho&s;ed who have hitherto di&s;puted on either &s;ide of this que&s;tion, that the people ap|pear ob&s;tinately enamoured of this new liquor: it is allowed, on both parts, that this liquor corrupts the mind and enervates the body, and de&s;troys vi|gour and virtue, at the &s;ame time that it makes tho&s;e who drink it too idle and too feeble for work, and while it impoveri&s;hes them by the pre&s;ent expence, di&s;ables them from retrieving its ill con&s;equences by &s;ub&s;equent indu&s;try.</P>
<P>'It might be imagined, my lords, that tho&s;e who had thus far agreed, would not ea&s;ily find any oc|ca&s;ion of di&s;pute, nor would any man, unacquainted with the motives by which &s;enatorial debates are too often influenced, &s;u&s;pect, that after the per|nicious qualities of this liquor, and the general inclination among the people to the immoderate u&s;e of it had been generally admitted, it could be afterwards enquired, whether it ought to be made more common, whether this univer&s;al thir&s;t for poi&s;on ought to be encouraged by the legi&s;lature, and whether a new &s;tatute ought to be made to &s;ecure drunkards in the gratification of their ap|petites.</P>
<P>'To pretend, my lords, that the de&s;ign of this bill is to prevent or dimini&s;h the u&s;e of &s;pirits, is to
<PB N="117" REF="118">
trample upon common &s;en&s;e, and to violate the rules of decency as well as of rea&s;on. For when did any man hear that a commodity was prohibited by licen&s;ing its &s;ale, or that to offer and refu&s;e is the &s;ame action.</P>
<P>'It is indeed pleaded that it will be made dearer by the tax which is propo&s;ed, and that the increa&s;e of the price will dimini&s;h the numbers of the purcha&s;ers, but it is at the &s;ame time expected, that this tax &s;hall &s;upply the expence of a war on the Continent. It is a&s;&s;erted therefore, that the con&s;umption of &s;pirits will be hindered, and yet, that it will be &s;uch as may be expected to furni&s;h, from a very &s;mall tax, a re|venue &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of armies, for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Auri&s;tan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Au&s;trian.</NOTE> family, and the re|pre&s;&s;ion of the attempts of Blefu&s;cu<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">France.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Surely, my lords, the&s;e expectations are not very con&s;i&s;tent, nor can it be imagined that they are both formed in the &s;ame head, though they may be ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame mouth. It is, however, &s;ome recommendation of a &s;tate&s;man, when, of his a&s;&s;er|tions, one can be found rea&s;onable or true, and in this, prai&s;e cannot be denied to our pre&s;ent mini&s;ters; for though it is undoubtedly fal&s;e that this tax will le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of &s;pirits, it is certainly true that it will produce a very large revenue, a revenue that will not fail but with the people from who&s;e debaucheries it ari&s;es.</P>
<P>'Our mini&s;ters will therefore have the &s;ame honour with their predece&s;&s;ors, of having given ri&s;e to a new fund, not indeed for the payment of our debts,
<PB N="118" REF="119">
but for much more valuable purpo&s;es, for the exaltation of our hearts under oppre&s;&s;ion, for the ele|vation of our &s;pirits amid&s;t mi&s;carriages and di&s;ap|pointments, and for the chearful &s;upport of tho&s;e debts which we have lo&s;t hopes of paying. They are re&s;olved, my lords, that the nation, which nothing can make wi&s;e, &s;hall, while they are at its head, at lea&s;t be merry, and &s;ince public happine&s;s is the end of government, they &s;eem to imagine that they &s;hall de&s;erve applau&s;e, by an expedient, which will enable every man to lay his cares a&s;leep, to drown &s;orrow, and lo&s;e, in the delights of drunkenne&s;s, both the public mi&s;eries and his own.</P>
<P>'Surely, my lords, men of this unbounded bene|volence and this exalted genius, de&s;erve &s;uch honours as were never paid before; they de&s;erve to be&s;tride a butt upon every &s;ign-po&s;t in the metropolis, or to have their countenances exhibited as tokens where this liquor is to be &s;old by the licen&s;e which they have procured. They mu&s;t be at lea&s;t remembered to future ages as the happy politicians, who after all expedients for rai&s;ing taxes had been employed, di&s;covered a new method of draining the la&s;t reliques of the public wealth, and added a new reve|nue to the government; nor will tho&s;e who &s;hall here|after enumerate the &s;everal funds now e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, forget, among the benefactors to their country, the illu&s;trious authors of the drinking fund.</P>
<P>'May I be allowed, my lords, to congratulate my countrymen and fellow-&s;ubjects upon the happy times which are now approaching, in which no

man will be di&s;qualified for the privilege of being drunk? when all di&s;content and di&s;loyalty &s;hall be forgotten, and the people, though now con&s;idered by the mini&s;try as their enemies, &s;hall acknowledge the lenity of that government under which all re&s;traints are taken away.</P>
<P>'But to a bill for &s;uch de&s;irable purpo&s;es, it would be proper, my lords, to prefix a preamble in which the kindne&s;s of our intentions &s;hould be more fully explained, that the nation may not mi&s;take our indulgence for cruelty, nor con&s;ider their bene|nefactors as their per&s;ecutors. If therefore this bill be con&s;idered and amended, (for why el&s;e &s;hould it be con&s;idered?) in a committee, I &s;hall humbly propo&s;e that it &s;hall be introduced in this manner: Whereas the de&s;igns of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, what|ever they are, cannot be executed without a great number of mercenaries, which mercenaries cannot be hired without money; and whereas the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of this nation to drunkenne&s;s, inclines us to believe, that they will pay more chearfully for the undi&s;turbed enjoyment of di&s;tilled liquors, than for any other conce&s;&s;ion that can be made by the government; be it enacted by the King's mo&s;t ex|cellent Maje&s;ty, that no man &s;hall hereafter be denied the right of being drunk on the following conditi|ons.</P>
<P>'This, my lords, to trifle no longer, is the proper preamble to this bill, which contains only the con|ditions on which the people of this kingdom are to be allowed henceforward to riot in debauchery, in de|bauchery licen&s;ed by law, and countenanced by the magi&s;trates, for there is no doubt but tho&s;e on whom
<PB N="120" REF="121">
the inventors of this tax &s;hall confer authority, will be directed to a&s;&s;i&s;t their ma&s;ters in their de&s;ign, to encourage the con&s;umption of that liquor from which &s;uch large revenues are expected, and to mul|tiply, without end, tho&s;e licen&s;es which are to pay an yearly tribute to the crown.</P>
<P>'By this unbounded licen&s;e, my lords, that price will be le&s;&s;ened, from the increa&s;e of which the ex|pectations of the efficacy of this law are pretended, for the number of retailers will le&s;&s;en the value as in all other ca&s;es, and le&s;&s;en it more than this tax will increa&s;e it. Be&s;ides, it is to be con&s;idered, that at pre&s;ent the retailer expects to be paid for the danger which he incurs by an unlawful trade, and will not tru&s;t his reputation or his pur&s;e to the mercy of his cu&s;tomer, without a profit proportioned to the hazard; but when once the re&s;traint &s;hall be taken away, he will &s;ell for common gain, and it can hardly be imagined, that at pre&s;ent he &s;ubjects him&s;elf to informations and penalties for le&s;s than &s;ix-pence a gallon.</P>
<P>'The &s;pecious pretence on which this bill is founded, and indeed the only pretence that de&s;erves to be termed &s;pecious, is the propriety of taxing vice; but this maxim of government has, on this occa&s;ion, been either mi&s;taken or perverted. Vice, my lords, is not, properly, to be taxed but &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and heavy taxes are &s;ometimes the only means by which that &s;uppre&s;&s;ion can be attained. Luxury, my lords, or the exce&s;s of that which is pernicious only by its exce&s;s, may very properly be taxed, that &s;uch exce&s;s, though not &s;trictly unlawful, may be made more difficult; but the u&s;e of tho&s;e things which
<PB N="121" REF="122">
are &s;imply hurtful, hurtful in their own nature and in every degree, is to be prohibited. None, my lords, ever heard in any nation of a tax upon theft or adultery, becau&s;e a tax implies a licen&s;e granted for the u&s;e of that which is taxed, to all who &s;hall be willing to pay it.</P>
<P>'Drunkenne&s;s, my lords, is univer&s;ally, and in all circum&s;tances an evil, and therefore ought not to be taxed, but puni&s;hed, and the means of it not to be made ea&s;y by a &s;light impo&s;t which none can feel, but to be removed out of the reach of the people, and &s;ecured by the heavie&s;t taxes levied with the utmo&s;t rigour. I hope tho&s;e to who&s;e care the religion of the nation is particularly con&s;igned, will unanimou&s;ly join with me in maintaining the ne|ce&s;&s;ity not of taxing vice but &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it, and unite for the rejection of a bill, by which the future as well as the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of thou&s;ands mu&s;t be de&s;troyed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gent.

<P>The &s;ubject of this important debate was a bill to re&s;train the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, founded on evi|dence that no le&s;s a quantity than &s;even millions of gallons thereof were yearly di&s;tilled and con&s;umed in this country, and that in many pari&s;hes within the

The bill, under the influence of the duke of Newca&s;tle, lord Carteret, Mr. Sandys and others, the then mini&s;try, pa&s;&s;ed the commons with little or no oppo&s;ition, and money was immediately rai&s;ed on the tax thereby im|po&s;ed. In the hou&s;e of lords it was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the bi&s;hops and many of the lay lords, with great force of rea&s;oning, and by lord Che&s;terfield in the above &s;peech, which has little of argument in it, though it goes to prove, that the practice ought to have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed rather than tolerated. It how|ever pa&s;&s;ed, and notwith&s;tanding the &s;ub&s;equent laws &s;ince made to palliate it, the evil to a great degree &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at this day.</P>
<P>In the peru&s;al of the&s;e debates, as written, we can|not but wonder at the powers that produced them.

Cave, who had no idea of the powers of eloquence over the human mind, became &s;en&s;ible of its effects in the profits it brought him: he had long thought that the &s;ucce&s;s of his Magazine proceeded from tho&s;e parts of it that were conducted by him&s;elf, which were the abridgement of weekly papers written again&s;t the mini&s;try, &s;uch as the Craft&s;man, Fog's Journal, Common Sen&s;e, the Weekly Mi&s;cellany, the We&s;t|min&s;ter Journal, and others, and al&s;o mar&s;halling the pa&s;torals, the elegies, and the &s;ongs, the epigrams, and the rebu&s;es that were &s;ent him by various corre&s;pon|dents, and was &s;carcely able to &s;ee the cau&s;es that at this time increa&s;ed the &s;ale of his pamphlet from ten to fifteen thou&s;and copies a month. But if he &s;aw not, he felt them, and manife&s;ted his good fortune by buying an old coach and a pair of older hor&s;es; and, that he might avoid the &s;u&s;picion of pride in &s;etting up an equipage, he di&s;played to the world the &s;ource of his affluence, by a repre&s;entation of St. John's gate, in&s;tead of his arms, on the door-pannel. This he told me him&s;elf was the rea&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hing his carriage from others, by what &s;ome might think a whim&s;ical device, and al&s;o for cau&s;ing it to be engraven on all his plate.</P>
<P>John&s;on had his reward, over and above the pecu|niary recompence vouch&s;afed him by Cave, in the general applau&s;e of his labours, which the increa&s;ed demand for the Magazine implied; but this, as his performances fell &s;hort of his powers, gratified him but little; on the contrary, he di&s;approved the deceit he was compelled to practice; his notions of morality were &s;o &s;trict, that he would &s;carcely allow the violation of truth in the mo&s;t trivial in&s;tances, and &s;aw, in fal&s;hood

<P>In the mean time it was curious to ob&s;erve how the deceit operated. It has above been remarked, that John&s;on had the art to give different colours to the &s;everal &s;peeches, &s;o that &s;ome appear to be declama|tory and energetic, re&s;embling the orations of De|mo&s;thenes; others like tho&s;e of Cicero, calm, per&s;ua|&s;ive; others, more particularly tho&s;e attributed to &s;uch country-gentlemen, merchants, and &s;eamen as had &s;eats in parliament, bear the characteri&s;tic of plainne&s;s, bluntne&s;s, and an affected hone&s;ty as oppo&s;ed to the plau&s;ibility of &s;uch as were under&s;tood or &s;u&s;pected to be courtiers: the artifice had its effect; Voltaire was betrayed by it into a declaration, that the eloquence of ancient Greece and Rome was revived in the Briti&s;h &s;enate, and a &s;peech of the late earl of Chatham when Mr. Pitt, in oppo&s;ition to one of Mr. Horatio Walpole, received the highe&s;t applau&s;e, and was by all that red it taken for genuine;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;peech here aliuded to, taking it to have been &s;poken as it is printed, was uttered in a debate on a bill for the encouragement and encrea&s;e of &s;eamen, containing a clau&s;e for a regi&s;ter of &s;eamen, and was intended to take away the nece&s;&s;ity of impre&s;&s;ing for the &s;ea-&s;ervice, which bill, as being a mini&s;terial mea&s;ure, was vehe|mently oppo&s;ed.

<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'SIR,</P><P>'I was unwilling to interrupt the cour&s;e of this debate while it was carried on with calmne&s;s and decency by men who do not &s;uffer the ardour of oppo&s;ition to cloud their rea&s;on, or tran&s;port them to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the dignity of this a&s;&s;embly does not admit. I have hitherto deferred to an&s;wer the gentleman who declaimed again&s;t the bill with &s;uch fluency of rhetoric, and &s;uch vehemence of ge&s;ture, who charged the advocates for the ex|pedients now propo&s;ed, with having no regard to any intere&s;t but their own, and with making laws only to con&s;ume paper, and threatened them with the defection of their adherents, and the lo&s;s of their influence, upon this new di&s;covery of their folly and their ignorance.</P><P>'Nor, Sir, do I now an&s;wer him for any other purpo&s;e than to remind him how little the clamours of rage, and petulancy of invectives contribute to the purpo&s;es for which this a&s;&s;embly is called together; how little the di&s;covery of truth is promoted, and the &s;ecurity of the nation e&s;tabli&s;hed by pompous diction and theatrical emotions.</P>
<P>'Formidable &s;ounds and furious declamations, confident a&s;&s;er|tions, and lofty periods, may affect the young and unexperienced, and perhaps the gentleman may have contracted his habits of oratory by conver&s;ing more with tho&s;e of his own age than with &s;uch as have had more opportunities of acquiring know|ledge, and more &s;ucce&s;sful methods of communicating their &s;entiments.</P>
<P>'If the heat of his temper, Sir, would &s;uffer him to attend to tho&s;e who&s;e age and long acquaintance with bu&s;ine&s;s give them an indi&s;putable right to deference and &s;uperiority, he would learn, in time, to rea&s;on rather than declaim, and to prefer ju&s;tne&s;s of argument, and an accurate knowledge of facts, to &s;ounding epithets and &s;plendid &s;uperlatives, which may di&s;turb the imagination for a moment, but leave no la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on the mind.</P>
<P>'He will learn, Sir, that to accu&s;e and prove are very different, and that reproaches, un&s;upported by evidence, affect only the character of him that utters them. Excur&s;ions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young men, but in no other, and it would &s;urely contribute more, even to the pur|po&s;e for which &s;ome gentlemen appear to &s;peak, that of depre|ciating the conduct of the admini&s;tration, to prove the incon|veniences and inju&s;tice of this bill, than barely to a&s;&s;ert them, with whatever magnificence of language or appearance of zeal, hone&s;ty or compa&s;&s;ion.</P></Q></P>
<P>To this &s;ober and temperate &s;peech uttered by a grave &s;enator, who had &s;erved his country in various capacities, and who&s;e moral character was irreproachable, the following was the an&s;wer of Mr. William Pitt:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'SIR,</P><P>'The atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honourable gentleman has with &s;uch &s;pirit and decency charged upon me, I &s;hall neither attempt to palliate nor deny, but con|tent my&s;elf with wi&s;hing, that I may be one of tho&s;e who&s;e follies may cea&s;e with their youth, and not of that number who are ignorant in &s;pite of experience.</P><P>'Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a reproach, I will not, Sir, a&s;&s;ume the province of determining; but &s;urely age may become ju&s;tly contemptible, if the opportunities which it brings have pa&s;&s;ed away without improvement, and vice appears to prevail when the pa&s;&s;ions have &s;ub&s;ided. The wretch that, after having &s;een the con&s;equences of a thou&s;and errors, con|tinues &s;till to blunder, and who&s;e age has only added ob&s;tinacy to &s;tupidity, is &s;urely the object of either abhorrence or con|tempt, and de&s;erves not that his grey head &s;hould &s;ecure him from in&s;ults.</P>
<P>'Much more, Sir, is he to be abhorred, who, as he has ad|vanced in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more wicked with le&s;s temptation, who pro&s;titutes him&s;elf for money which he cannot enjoy, and &s;pends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country.</P>
<P>'But youth, Sir, is not my only crime; I have been accu&s;ed of acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may either imply &s;ome peculiarities of ge&s;ture, or a di&s;&s;imulation of my real &s;en|timents, and an adoption of the opinions and language of another man.</P>
<P>'In the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, Sir, the charge is too trifling to be con|futed, and de&s;erves only to be mentioned that it may be de&s;|pi&s;ed. I am at liberty, like every other man, to u&s;e my own language; and though I may perhaps have &s;ome ambition to plea&s;e this gentleman, I &s;hall not lay my&s;elf under any re&s;traint, nor very &s;olicitou&s;ly copy his diction or his mien, however matur|ed by age, or modelled by experience.</P>
<P>'If any man &s;hall, by charging me with theatrical behaviour, imply, that I utter any &s;entiments but my own, I &s;hall treat him as a calumniator and a villain, nor &s;hall any protection &s;helter him from the treatment which he de&s;erves. I &s;hall, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, without &s;cruple, trample upon all tho&s;e forms with which wealth and dignity intrench them&s;elves, nor &s;hall any thing but age re&s;train my re&s;entment. Age, which always brings one privilege, that of being in&s;olent and &s;upercilious without puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>'But with regard, Sir, to tho&s;e whom I have offended, I am of opinion, that if I had acted a borrowed part, I &s;hould have avoided their cen&s;ure; the heat that offended them is the ar|dour of conviction, and that zeal for the &s;ervice of my country, which neither hope nor fear &s;hall influence me to &s;uppre&s;s. I will not &s;it unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, nor look in &s;ilence upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavours, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggre&s;&s;or and drag the thief to ju&s;tice, whoever may protect them in their villany, and who|ever may partake of their plunder. And if the honourable gen|tleman&mdash;At the&s;e words Mr. Winnington ro&s;e up, and calling Mr. Pitt to order, made a &s;hort &s;peech, to which Mr. Pitt made this an&s;wer:</P>
<P>'If this be to pre&s;erve order, there is no danger of indecency from the mo&s;t licentious tongue, for what calumny can be more atrocious, or what reproach more &s;evere, than that of &s;peaking with regard to any thing but truth. Order may &s;ometimes be broken by pa&s;&s;ion or inadvertency, but will hardly be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by monitors like this, who cannot govern his own pa&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t he is re&s;training the impetuo&s;ity of others.</P>
<P>'Happy, Sir, would it be for mankind, if every one knew his own province; we &s;hould not then &s;ee the &s;ame man at once a criminal and a judge, nor would this gentleman a&s;&s;ume the right of dictating to others, what he has not learned him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'That I may return in &s;ome degree the favour which he in|tends me, I will advi&s;e him never hereafter to exert him&s;elf on the &s;ubject of order, but, whenever he finds him&s;elf inclined to &s;peak on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to remember how he has now &s;uc|ceeded, and condemn in &s;ilence, what his cen&s;ures will never reform<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gent.

In the meetings of his party to &s;ettle the method of conducting a debate, in oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;ter, he declined the enforcing particular charges of mal-admini&s;tration, and always cho&s;e what he called the peroration.</NOTE>. In other particulars the debates of John&s;on are liable to the &s;ame objections, but in a greater degree, as tho&s;e of Guthrie; the language of them is too good, and the &s;tyle &s;uch as none of the per&s;ons to whom the &s;peeches are a&s;&s;igned were able to di&s;cour&s;e in.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;ion of John&s;on above-mentioned, was the fir&s;t that revealed the &s;ecret that the debates in|&s;erted in the Gentleman's Magazine were fictitious, and compo&s;ed by him&s;elf. After that, he was free, and indeed indu&s;trious, in the communication of it, for being informed that Dr. Smollet was writing a hi&s;tory of England, and had brought it down to the la&s;t reign, he cautioned him not to rely on the debates as given in the Magazine, for that they were not au|thentic, but, excepting as to their general import, the work of his own imagination.</P>
<P>As the &s;ubjects of the&s;e debates are at this time be|come very little intere&s;ting, I &s;hall not attempt, farther than I have already done, to embelli&s;h the&s;e memoirs by a &s;election of any of tho&s;e nervous arguments, or eloquent pa&s;&s;ages with which they abound, and the rather as it is impo&s;&s;ible in the relation of a conflict between two contending parties, to determine the me|rits of their &s;everal preten&s;ions, or di&s;tingui&s;h between

&s;pecious, and &s;ound rea&s;oning. In the attempts to remove the mini&s;ter, experience has however con|vinced us, that ambition and per&s;onal re&s;entment were the motives that actuated his opponents, for neither when they attained to power did they manife&s;t greater integrity, nor did they cea&s;e to practi&s;e tho&s;e methods for the maintaining their influence over the public councils, which were imputed to him as criminal.</P>
<P>It is be&s;ide my purpo&s;e to enter into a formal defence of the admini&s;tration of this &s;ervant of the public, or to attempt a detection of the arts that were practi&s;ed to render him odious: I will never|thele&s;s mention a few facts re&s;pecting him that have come to my own knowledge, and may &s;erve to excul|pate him, in &s;ome degree, from the charge of being an enemy to the con&s;titution or the intere&s;ts of this country.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t came into power, he found it his duty to undertake the arduous ta&s;k of reconciling the people to the dominion of a prince born in a foreign country, and &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his de&s;cendants, and this he lived to &s;ee effected. War he hated as much as &s;ome of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors did peace, and from a war with Spain he fore&s;aw that no good could follow: the &s;ettlements abroad of that power are very remote, and in a climate de&s;tructive to Engli&s;hmen; &s;o that what we were ever able to take from them we never could hold. The exten&s;ion of empire was never his wi&s;h; but the encouragement of commerce and the improve|ment of the revenue, in both which &s;ubjects his &s;kill was unrivalled, engro&s;&s;ed his attention. To effect the one, a greater number of laws in its favour were framed and
<PB N="131" REF="132">
pa&s;&s;ed under his &s;anction, than had ever been enacted in any known period of equal duration with his mini&s;try; and to carry the other into practice, he projected a &s;cheme for an exten&s;ion of the exci&s;e, as the only means of put|ting a &s;top to the frauds of merchants and illicit traders, and making the receipts of that branch of the public income equal to what they were computed at. This &s;cheme, it is true, &s;ubjected him to much ob|loquy, and he was nece&s;&s;itated to abandon it; but in a &s;ucceeding admini&s;tration it was partly carried into execution, at the expre&s;s &s;olicitation of the principal per&s;ons concerned in that article of trade which it was &s;ugge&s;ted would have been mo&s;t affected had the &s;cheme pa&s;&s;ed into a law: and afterwards the mo&s;t popular mini&s;ter that ever directed the councils of this country, &s;crupled not to declare in full &s;enate, that if ever a time &s;hould arrive that was likely to render the project fea&s;ible, him&s;elf would recommend an ex|ten&s;ion of the exci&s;e-laws as a mea&s;ure big with ad|vantage to commerce, to the revenue, and to the general intere&s;ts of the kingdom.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion whether he was in principle an enemy to his country or not, will po&s;&s;ibly be decided by the following fact, which the be&s;t authority warrants me in relating: When he was &s;eized with the di&s;order that put a period to his days, and from its violence he had abandoned the hope of living much longer, he called one of his &s;ons to him, gave him his ble&s;&s;ing, and with tears in his eyes told him, that from intelli|gence he had obtained, he would a&s;&s;ure him that with|in a twelvemonth's time the crown of England would be fought for upon Engli&s;h ground: the &s;ub&s;equent

rebellion in 1745, and the irruptions of the enemy beyond the borders of the north, verified this pre|diction.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall have but little occa&s;ion to &s;ay more of the debates in parliament as they appear in the Ma|gazine, I &s;hall clo&s;e the account above given of them with &s;aying, that John&s;on continued to write them till the pa&s;&s;ing the bill for re&s;training the &s;ale of &s;pirituous liquors, which was about the end of the year 1743. After that, they were written by Dr. Hawke&s;worth, and by him continued to about 1760, within which period the plan of the Magazine was enlarged by a review of new publications. In this, Mr. Owen Ruffhead was fir&s;t employed, but he being, in about two years, invited to &s;uperinted a re-publication of the Statutes at large, the office of reviewer dropped into the hands of Dr. Hawke&s;worth, who, though he was thought to exerci&s;e it with &s;ome a&s;perity, conti|nued in it till about the year 1772, when he was em|ployed to dige&s;t the papers of &s;undry late navigators, and to become the editor of that collection of voyages, which in the catalogues of book&s;ellers is di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by his name.</P>
<P>About this time John&s;on was &s;olicited to undertake an employment of a kind very different from any he had ever been accu&s;tomed to: it was to compile a catalogue of books; a ta&s;k, which at fir&s;t view, &s;eems to be not above the capacity of almo&s;t the lowe&s;t of literary artificers, but on a nearer was found to re|quire the abilities of one of the highe&s;t. O&s;borne the book&s;eller, had ventured on the purcha&s;e of the earl of Oxford's library of printed books, at the price of 13000l. and meaning to di&s;po&s;e of them by &s;ale
<PB N="133" REF="134">
at his &s;hop in the ordinary way, projected a catalogue thereof di&s;tributed into common-places, in five octavo volumes, which being &s;old for five &s;hillings each, would pay it&s;elf, and circulate throughout the king|dom and al&s;o abroad.</P>
<P>It is probable that O&s;borne had con&s;ulted Mait|taire, then one of the ma&s;ters of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and who had formerly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making out the Catalogus librorum manu&s;criptorum Angliae &amp; Hiberniae, on the &s;ubject of his intended catalogue, and that Maittaire might have furni&s;hed the general heads or cla&s;&s;es under which the &s;everal books are arranged, a work of &s;ome labour, and that required no &s;mall &s;tock of erudition. This at lea&s;t is certain, that he drew up a Latin dedica|tion of the whole to Lord Carteret, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and &s;ub&s;cribed it with his name; but the un|der-workmen were, as I conjecture, fir&s;t Oldys, and afterwards John&s;on, who while he was engaged in &s;o &s;ervile an employment re&s;embled a lion in harne&s;s. The former of the&s;e per&s;ons was a natural &s;on of Dr. Oldys, a civilian of &s;ome eminence, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by writing for the book&s;ellers. Having a general know|ledge of books, he had been long retained in the &s;er|vice of Edward earl of Oxford, and was therefore by O&s;borne thought a fit per&s;on for his purpo&s;e; but whe|ther they di&s;agreed, or that Oldys was hindered by the re&s;traint of his per&s;on in the Fleet, a misfortune that he laboured under &s;ome time about that period, he de&s;i&s;t|ed, after having proceeded to the end of the &s;econd volume. The third and fourth I conceive to be the work of John&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At what part of the catalogue Oldys's labours ended and John|&s;on's begin I have no expre&s;s authority for &s;aying: It is related of John&s;on, by a per&s;on who was very likely to know the fact, that he was employed by O&s;borne to make <Q REND="inline">'a catalogue of the Harleian Library,'</Q> and if not to make &s;uch remarks on the books as are above in&s;erted, an ordinary hand would have done as well; but it required the learning of a &s;cholar to furni&s;h &s;uch intelligence as the catalogue contains. This is one of the facts on which I ground my a&s;&s;ertion that John&s;on worked on the catalogue: to di&s;criminate be|tween his notes and tho&s;e of Oldys, is not ea&s;y; as literary curio|&s;ities, and as a &s;pecimen of a great work, they neverthele&s;s de&s;erve attention.</P></NOTE>; the fifth is nothing more than a catalogue of O&s;borne's old &s;tock.</P>

The catalogue of the Harleian printed books, for of the manu&s;cripts there is another in being, drawn up by an able hand, is of that kind which philolo|gi&s;ts call Bibliotheque Rai&s;on&eacute;e, in which be&s;ides the title, and the colophon containing the place and year of publication, a de&s;cription of each article is given, &s;erving to &s;hew both its intrin&s;ic and extrin&s;ic worth, the hands through which it has pa&s;&s;ed, and various other particulars that tend to recommend it. I will &s;elect a few examples of this kind from the third volume, and leave the reader to applaud the judg|ment of O&s;borne in appointing &s;o able a man as John&s;on to this laborious ta&s;k, and the indu&s;try and per&s;everance of the latter in the performance of it.</P>

<P>The catalogue having pa&s;&s;ed the pre&s;s, turned out to be very voluminous, and being of a &s;ingular kind, O&s;borne hoped to be able to make the public pay for it; to this end it was, that he directed John&s;on to draw up the preface, giving an account of the contents of the library, and containing a variety of arguments to vindicate a &s;olicitation for a &s;ub&s;cription, that is to
<PB N="146" REF="147">
&s;ay, a demand of five &s;hillings for each volume of the catalogue, to defray the expence of printing it; the volume or volumes &s;o purcha&s;ed, to be taken in exchange for any book rated at the &s;ame value. This paper, of which a character has already been given, was, as I conjecture, a precur&s;or to the cata|logue, and was with great indu&s;try circulated through|out the kingdom. It an&s;wered its end; the catalogue was printed in five octavo volumes, the collectors and lovers of books bought it, and O&s;borne was reim|bur&s;ed.</P>
<P>While the catalogue was compiling, John&s;on was fur|ther employed by O&s;borne to &s;elect from the many thou|&s;and volumes of which the library con&s;i&s;ted, all &s;uch &s;mall tracts and fugitive pieces as were of greate&s;t value or were mo&s;t &s;carce, with a view to the reprint|ing and publi&s;hing them under the title of the Har|leian Mi&s;cellany. To recommend a &s;ub&s;cription for printing the collection, propo&s;als were publi&s;hed con|taining an account of the undertaking, and an enume|ration of its contents, penned by John&s;on with great art; which being very &s;hort, may it&s;elf be deemed a fugitive piece, and is therefore here in&s;erted.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'It has been for a long time a very ju&s;t complaint among the learned, that a multitude of valuable pro|ductions, publi&s;hed in &s;mall pamphlets, or in &s;ingle &s;heets, are in a &s;hort time, too often by accidents or negligence, de&s;troyed and entirely lo&s;t; and that tho&s;e authors, who&s;e reverence for the public has hindered them from &s;welling their works with repe|titions, or incumbering them with &s;uperfluities, and who, therefore, de&s;erve the prai&s;e and gratitude of
<PB N="147" REF="148">
po&s;terity, are forgotten, for the very rea&s;on for which they might expect to be remembered. It has been long lamented, that the duration of the monuments of genius and &s;tudy, as well as of wealth and power, depends in no &s;mall mea&s;ure on their bulk; and that volumes, con&s;iderable only for their &s;ize, are handed down from one age to another, when compendious treati&s;es, of far greater importance, are &s;uffered to peri&s;h, as the compacte&s;t bodies &s;ink into the water, while tho&s;e of which the exten&s;ion bears a greater proportion to the weight, float upon the &s;urface.</P>
<P>'This ob&s;ervation hath been &s;o often confirmed by experience, that, in the neighbouring nation, the common appellation of &s;mall performances is derived from this unfortunate circum&s;tance; a <HI>flying &s;heet,</HI> or a <HI>fugitive piece,</HI> are the terms by which they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and di&s;tingui&s;hed with too great propriety, as they are &s;ubject, after having amu&s;ed mankind for a while, to take their flight and di&s;appear for ever.</P>
<P>'What are the lo&s;&s;es which the learned have already &s;u&s;tained, by having neglected to fix tho&s;e fugitives in &s;ome certain re&s;idence, it is not ea&s;y to &s;ay; but there is no doubt that many valuable ob&s;ervations have been repeated, becau&s;e they were not pre&s;erved; and that, therefore, the progre&s;s of knowledge has been retarded, by the nece&s;&s;ity of doing what had been already done, but was done for tho&s;e who forgot their benefactor.</P>
<P>'The obvious method of preventing the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, of pre&s;erving to every man the reputation he has me|rited by long a&s;&s;iduity, is to unite the&s;e &s;cattered
<PB N="148" REF="149">
pieces into volumes, that tho&s;e which are too &s;mall to pre&s;erve them&s;elves, may be &s;ecured by their combination with others; to con&s;olidate the&s;e atoms of learning into &s;y&s;tems, to collect the&s;e di&s;united rays, that their light and their fire may become per|ceptible.</P>
<P>'Of encouraging this u&s;eful de&s;ign, the &s;tudious and inqui&s;itive have now an opportunity, which, perhaps, was never offered them before, and which, if it &s;hould now be lo&s;t, there is not any probability that they will ever recover. They may now con|ceive them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lake into which all tho&s;e rivulets of &s;cience have for many years been flowing: but which, unle&s;s its waters are turned into proper channels, will &s;oon bur&s;t its banks, or be di&s;|per&s;ed in imperceptible exhalations.</P>
<P>'In the Harleian library, which I have purcha&s;ed, are trea&s;ured a greater number of pamphlets and &s;mall treati&s;es, than were perhaps ever yet &s;een in one place; productions of the writers of all parties, and of every age, from the reformation; collected with an unbounded and unwearied curio&s;ity, without exclu&s;ion of any &s;ubject.</P>
<P>'So great is the variety, that it has been no &s;mall labour to peru&s;e the titles, in order to reduce them to a rude divi&s;ion, and range their heaps under general heads; of which the number, though not yet in|crea&s;ed by the &s;ubdivi&s;ion which an accurate &s;urvey will nece&s;&s;arily produce, cannot but excite the curio|&s;ity of all the &s;tudious, as there is &s;carcely any part of knowledge which &s;ome of the&s;e articles do not comprehend.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="150">
[Then follows an enumeration of articles to the amount of more than an hundred and fifty, which it is needle&s;s here to in&s;ert.]</P>
<P>'As many of the&s;e tracts mu&s;t be ob&s;cure by length of time, or defective for want of tho&s;e di&s;co|veries which have been made &s;ince they were writ|ten, there will be added &s;ome hi&s;torical, explanatory, or &s;upplemental notes, in which the occa&s;ion of the treati&s;e will be &s;hewn, or an account given of the author, allu&s;ions to forgotten facts will be illu&s;trat|ed, or the &s;ubject farther elucidated from other writers.'</P></Q></P>
<P>We may well conclude that the propo&s;al met with all due encouragement, as the pieces recommended in it were in the year 1749, publi&s;hed in eight quarto volumes. To the fir&s;t of them was prefixed, as an introduction, an e&s;&s;ay on the origin and importance of &s;mall tracts and fugitive pieces.</P>
<P>O&s;borne was an opulent trade&s;man, as may be judg|ed from his ability to make &s;o large a purcha&s;e as that above-mentioned; he was u&s;ed to boa&s;t that he was worth forty thou&s;and pounds, but of book&s;ellers he was one of the mo&s;t ignorant: of title-pages or edi|tions he had no knowledge or remembrance, but in all the tricks and arts of his trade he was mo&s;t expert. John&s;on, in his life of Pope &s;ays, that he was entirely de&s;titute of &s;hame, without &s;en&s;e of any di&s;grace, but that of poverty. He purcha&s;ed a number of un&s;old copies of Mr. Pope's Iliad, of the folio &s;ize, printed on an inferior paper and without cuts, and cutting off the top and bottom margins, which were very large, had the impudence to call them the &s;ub&s;cription books, and
<PB N="150" REF="151">
to vend them as &s;uch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a note on the Dunciad, Book ii. ver&s;e 167, in the later editions.</NOTE>. His in&s;olence to his cu&s;to|mers was al&s;o frequently pa&s;t bearing. If one came for a book in his catalogue, he would endeavour to force on him &s;ome new publication of his own, and, if he refu&s;ed, would affront him.</P>
<P>I mention the above particulars of this worthle&s;s fellow as an introduction to a fact re&s;pecting his be|haviour to John&s;on, which I have often heard related, and which him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed to be true. John&s;on, while employed in &s;electing pieces for the Harleian Mi&s;cel|lany, was nece&s;&s;itated, not only to peru&s;e the title-page of each article, but frequently to examine its contents, in order to form a judgment of its worth and importance, in the doing whereof, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, curio&s;ity might &s;ometimes detain him too long, and whenever it did, O&s;borne was offended. Seeing John&s;on one day deeply engaged in peru&s;ing a book, and the work being for the in&s;tant at a &s;tand, he reproached him with in|attention and delay, in &s;uch coar&s;e language as few men would u&s;e, and &s;till fewer could brook: the other in his ju&s;tification a&s;&s;erted &s;omewhat, which O&s;borne an&s;wered by giving him the lie; John&s;on's anger at &s;o &s;oul a charge, was not &s;o great as to make him for|get that he had weapons at hand: he &s;eized a folio that lay near him, and with it felled his adver&s;ary to the ground, with &s;ome exclamation, which, as it is dif|ferently related, I will not venture to repeat.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action, which has been &s;eldom urged with any other view than to &s;hew that John&s;on was of
<PB N="151" REF="152">
an ira&s;cible temper, is generally related as an entertain|ing &s;tory: with me it has always been a &s;ubject of me|lancholy reflection. In our e&s;timation of the enjoy|ments of this life, we place wi&s;dom, virtue, and learn|ing in the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and riches and other adventitious gifts of fortune in the la&s;t. The natural &s;ubordination of the one to the other we &s;ee and approve, and when that is di&s;turbed we are &s;orry. How then mu&s;t it affect a &s;en&s;ible mind to contemplate that misfortune, which could &s;ubject a man endued with a capacity for the highe&s;t offices, a philo&s;opher, a poet, an orator, and, if fortune had &s;o ordered, a chancellor, a prelate, a &s;tate&s;man, to the in&s;olence of a mean, worthle&s;s, ig|norant fellow, who had nothing to ju&s;tify the &s;uperi|ority he exerci&s;ed over a man &s;o endowed, but tho&s;e advantages which Providence indi&s;criminately di&s;pen&s;es to the worthy and the worthle&s;s! to &s;ee &s;uch a man, for the &s;upply of food and raiment, &s;ubmitting to the commands of his inferior, and, as a hireling, look|ing up to him for the reward of his work, and receiv|ing it accompanied with reproach and contumely, this, I &s;ay, is a &s;ubject of melancholy reflection.</P>
<P>Having completed the Harleian catalogue and mi&s;|cellany, and thereby di&s;engaged him&s;elf from O&s;borne, John&s;on was at liberty to pur&s;ue &s;ome &s;cheme of profit, le&s;s irk&s;ome than that in which he had &s;o lately been employed. Biography was a kind of writing that he delighted in; it called forth his powers of reflection, and gave him occa&s;ion to contemplate human life and manners. He had made &s;ome e&s;&s;ays of his ta|lent in the lives of Barretier and Boerhaave, men un|known to him, and was now prompted to give to the
<PB N="152" REF="153">
world that of a friend with whom he had been clo&s;ely intimate, who&s;e &s;ingular character and adver&s;e fortunes afforded ample &s;cope for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and fur|ni&s;hed matter for many admirable le&s;&s;ons of mo|rality.</P>
<P>This friend was Savage, of whom it has above been related, that his friends had undertaken to rai&s;e an annual &s;ub&s;cription for his &s;upport at Swan&s;ea in Wales, but that his departure for that place was retarded by &s;ome difficulties that occurred in the cour&s;e of their endeavours to rai&s;e it: the&s;e, however, were overcome, and Savage, in July 1739, took leave of London, and al&s;o of John&s;on, who, as him&s;elf tells us, parted from him with tears in his eyes. His &s;ub|&s;equent hi&s;tory is, that taking his way through Bri&s;tol, he was for &s;ome time detained there by an embargo on the &s;hipping. After &s;ome &s;tay he was enabled to de|part, and he reached Swan&s;ea; but not liking the place, and re&s;enting the treatment of his contributors, who &s;eem to have been &s;lack in the performance of their engagements to &s;upport him, he returned to Bri&s;tol with an intent to come to London, a purpo&s;e he was hindered from effecting by an arre&s;t of his per&s;on, on the 10th of January 1742-3, for the &s;mall &s;um of eight pounds, and carried to Newgate in that city, where, not being able to extricate him&s;elf from his confinement, he, on the 31&s;t day of July, in the &s;ame year, died.</P>
<P>This event, and the affection which he had long en|tertained for the man, called forth John&s;on to an exer|ci&s;e of his pen, which, as it is &s;aid, employed it only thirty-&s;ix hours, in a narrative of events &s;o &s;ingular
<PB N="153" REF="154">
as could &s;carcely fail to gratify the curio&s;ity of every one who wi&s;hed to be in&s;tructed in the &s;cience of human life. The &s;ubject was &s;uch an one as is &s;eldom exhibited to view; a man dropped into the world as from a cloud, committed to the care of tho&s;e who had little intere&s;t in his pre&s;ervation, and none in the forming his temper, or the infu&s;ing into him tho&s;e little precepts of morality, which might germinate in his mind, and be productive of habitual virtue; the&s;e are advantages which children of the lowe&s;t birth enjoy, in &s;ome degree, in common with tho&s;e of a higher; but of the&s;e he never participated. All the knowledge he attained to, from his infancy upwards, was &s;elf-acquired, and, bating that he was born in a city where the refinements of civil life pre&s;ented to his view a rule of moral conduct, he may be &s;aid to have been little le&s;s a miracle than Hai Ebn Yokdhan is feigned to be.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved of tho&s;e children who owe their nurture and education to a certain benevolent in&s;titution in this metropolis, that being by their misfortune &s;trangers to tho&s;e charities that ari&s;e from the relations of father, &s;on, and brother, their charac|ters a&s;&s;ume a complexion that marks their conduct through life. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Savage, and will perhaps account for that want of gratitude to his benefactors, and other defects in his temper, with which he &s;eems to have been ju&s;tly chargeable.</P>
<P>The manner in which John&s;on has written this life is very judicious: it afforded no great actions to cele|brate, no improvements in &s;cience to record, nor any variety of events to remark on. It was a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="154" REF="155">
of di&s;appointments, and a complication of mi&s;eries; and as it was an uniform contradiction to the axiom that human life is chequered with good and evil acci|dents, was alone &s;ingular. The virtues and vices which like flowers and weeds &s;prang up together, and perhaps with an equal degree of vigour, in the mind of this unfortunate man, afforded, it is true, a &s;ubject of &s;peculation, and John&s;on has not failed to avail him&s;elf of &s;o extraordinary a moral phenomenon as that of a mind exalted to a high degree of improve|ment without the aid of culture.</P>
<P>But if the events of Savage's life are few, the reflections thereon are many, &s;o that the work may as well be deemed a &s;eries of oeconomical precepts as a narrative of facts. In it is contained a character, which may be &s;aid to be <HI>&s;ui generis;</HI> a woman who had proclaimed her crimes, and &s;olicited reproach, di&s;owning from the in&s;tant of his birth, and procuring to be illegitimated by parliament, her own &s;on, doom|ing him to poverty and ob&s;curity, and launching him upon the ocean of life, only that he might be &s;wallowed by its quick-&s;ands, or da&s;hed upon its rocks, and la&s;tly, endeavouring to rid her&s;elf from the danger of being at any time made known to him, by &s;ecretly &s;ending him to the American plantations.</P>
<P>It farther exhibits to view, a man of genius de&s;titute of relations and friends, and with no one to direct his pur&s;uits, becoming an author by nece&s;&s;ity, and a writer for the &s;tage, and forming &s;uch connections as that profe&s;&s;ion leads to, &s;ometimes improving, and at others &s;lighting them, but at all times acting with a &s;pirit that better became his birth than his circum|&s;tances;
<PB N="155" REF="156">
for who that knew how to di&s;tingui&s;h between one and the other, would, like Savage, have &s;olicited a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;purned at the offer of it? or repaid reiterated kindne&s;&s;es with neglect or oblivious taci|turnity?</P>
<P>Inter&s;per&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the narrative are a great variety of moral &s;entiments, prudential maxims, and mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;ervations on men and things; but the &s;entiment that &s;eems to pervade the whole is, that idlene&s;s, whether voluntary or nece&s;&s;itated, is pro|ductive of the greate&s;t evils that human nature is ex|po&s;ed to; and this the author exemplifies in an enu|meration of the calamities that a man is &s;ubjected to by the want of a profe&s;&s;ion, and by &s;hewing how far le&s;s happy &s;uch an one mu&s;t be than he who has only a mere manual occupation to depend on for his &s;upport.</P>
<P>The concluding paragraph of the book explains the author's intention in writing it, and points out the u&s;e that may be made of it in &s;uch pointed terms, that I &s;hall need, as I tru&s;t, no excu&s;e for in&s;erting &s;o fine a &s;pecimen of &s;tile and &s;entiment.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'This relation will not be wholly without its u&s;e, if tho&s;e who langui&s;h under any part of his &s;uffer|ings &s;hall be enabled to fortify their patience by re|flecting, that they feel only tho&s;e afflictions from which the abilities of Savage did not exempt him; or if tho&s;e who in confidence of &s;uperior capacities or attainments, di&s;regard the common maxims of life, &s;hall be reminded, that nothing will &s;upply the want of prudence, and that negligence and irregu|larity long continued, will make knowledge u&s;ele&s;s, wit ridiculous, and genius contemptible.'</Q></P>

This celebrated e&s;&s;ay in biography was publi&s;hed in the month of February 1744, and gave occa&s;ion to Henry Fielding, the author of a periodical paper intitled <Q REND="inline">'The Champion,'</Q> to commend it in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">'This pamphlet is, without flattery to its author, as ju&s;t and well written a piece as, of its kind, I ever &s;aw; &s;o that, at the &s;ame time that it highly de&s;erves, it &s;tands certainly very little in need of this recom|mendation.&mdash;As to the hi&s;tory of the unfortunate per&s;on who&s;e memoirs compo&s;e this work, it is cer|tainly penned with equal accuracy and &s;pirit, of which I am &s;o much the better judge, as I knew many of the facts mentioned in it to be &s;trictly true, and very fairly related. Be&s;ides, it is not only the &s;tory of Mr. Savage, but innumerable incidents relating to other per&s;ons and other affairs, which render this a very amu&s;ing, and withal, a very in&s;tructive and valuable performance. The author's ob&s;erva|tions are &s;hort, &s;ignificant and ju&s;t, as his narrative is remarkably &s;mooth and well di&s;po&s;ed: his re|flections open to us all the rece&s;&s;es of the human heart, and, in a word, a more ju&s;t or plea&s;ant, a more engaging or a more improving treati&s;e on the excellencies and defects of human nature, is &s;carce to be found in our own or perhaps in any other language.'</Q></P>
<P>The life I am now writing &s;eems to divide it&s;elf into two periods; the fir&s;t marked by a &s;eries of afflic|tions, the la&s;t by &s;ome cheering rays of comfort and comparative affluence.

<P>As the narrowne&s;s of his father's circum&s;tances had &s;hut him out of tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions for which an univer|&s;ity education is a nece&s;&s;ary qualification, and his project of an academy had failed, he had, as to his cour&s;e of life, no choice but idlene&s;s or the exerci&s;e of his talents in a way that might afford him &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and provide for the day that was pa&s;&s;ing over him, &s;o that the profe&s;&s;ion of an author was the only one in his power to adopt. That it was far from an eligible one, he had in &s;ome degree experienced, and his aver&s;ion to labour magnified the evils of it, by bringing to his recollection the examples of Am|hur&s;t, of Savage, of Boy&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The lives of the&s;e three per&s;ons as they exhibit an example of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which idlene&s;s and the want of moral principles may expo&s;e men of parts, may be an u&s;eful caveat to young men of the ri&s;ing generation, and prove a more powerful per&s;ua&s;ive to indu&s;try, oeconomy, and the right u&s;e of great talents, than the mo&s;t laboured argument.

<P>Nicholas Amhur&s;t was born at Marden in Kent; but in what year is uncertain: he received his education in Merchant-Taylors' &s;chool in London, and was thence removed to St. John's college, Oxford; but expelled for the libertini&s;m of his principles and the irregularity of his conduct. After this expul&s;ion, for which very different cau&s;es were a&s;&s;igned by him and tho&s;e who enforced, it, he &s;atirized the learning and di&s;cipline of the univer&s;ity, and expo&s;ed the characters of its mo&s;t re&s;pectable members, in a poem called <Q REND="inline">'Oculus Britanniae,'</Q> and in his <Q REND="inline">'Terrae Filius,'</Q> a work compounded of wit and &s;currility. He, &s;oon after, quitted Ox|ford, came to London, and publi&s;hed a volume of mi&s;cellanies: he wrote many &s;atirical and malignant poems, and tran&s;lated &s;ome of Mr. Addi&s;on's Latin pieces; but his chief fame aro&s;e from his conducting the <Q REND="inline">'Craft&s;man,'</Q> in which he was made the tool of oppo|fition. For &s;ome extraordinarily indi&s;creet u&s;e of his libelling powers, the printers of this paper were &s;eized, and Mr. Amhur&s;t, with a view of being con&s;idered as the victim of his party, and more than indemnified for all he &s;hould &s;uffer, &s;urrendered him&s;elf; but the pro&s;ecution dropped, and he was di&s;appointed. Upon the famous compromi&s;e of 1742, no terms were &s;tipulated by his friends for him who had been the in&s;trument of their &s;ucce&s;s; the reflection whereon is thought to have precipitated his end; for he died in a few months after, as is &s;aid, of a broken heart, and was indebted to the bounty of Franklin the printer for a grave.</P>
<P>Samuel Boy&s;e, the &s;on of an Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, was born in 1708, and educated at a private &s;chool in Dublin. At eighteen he was &s;ent to Gla&s;gow, and before he had completed his nineteenth year, married the daughter of a trade&s;man there. His father, for a con&s;iderable time, &s;upported his natural extravagance, which his wife, who was di&s;&s;olute and vicious, rendered &s;till more burthen|&s;ome. This re&s;ource failing, he went to Edinburgh, where his poetical abilities procured him many friends, particularly the counte&s;s of Eglinton and lord Stormont, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his exigencies, and were di&s;po&s;ed to continue their bounty; but Boy&s;e's charac|ter and deportment repelled kindne&s;s. His talents were great: he had a genius for poetry, for painting, and mu&s;ic; yet it was &s;o ob&s;cured by a mean and &s;ordid temper, that many knew him inti|mately without di&s;covering his abilities: his cho&s;en acquaintances were &s;uch as could not &s;erve him: he was intoxicated whenever he had the means to avoid &s;tarving, and was voluptuous, luxurious, and boundle&s;sly expen&s;ive, without the lea&s;t ta&s;te for what is ele|gant. The contempt he drew on him&s;elf at Edinburgh made him re&s;olve on quitting it for London, whither tho&s;e who had been his patrons gave him very valuable recommendatory letters; but he &s;lighted them, and preferred &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by precarious donations. In the year 1740 he was reduced to the want of nece&s;&s;ary apparel, and having pawned whatever he could exi&s;t without, was con|fined by his indigence to a bed which had no &s;heets: here, to procure food, he wrote; his po&s;ture &s;itting up in bed, his only covering a blanket, in which a hole was made to admit of the employment of his arm.</P>
<P>In 1742, while in a &s;punging-hou&s;e, he was driven to &s;olicit Cave for &s;ome temporary relief, and to procure it, wrote the following horrible de&s;cription of the &s;ituation into which his neglect of oeconomy and his want of common prudence had plunged him.</P>

<P>I wrote you ye&s;terday an account of my unhappy ca&s;e. I am every moment threatened to be turned out here, becau&s;e I have not money to pay for my bed two nights pa&s;t, which is u&s;ually paid beforehand; and I am loth to go into the counter, till I &s;ee if my affair can po&s;&s;ibly be made up. I hope, therefore, you will have the humanity to &s;end me half a guinea for &s;upport, till I can fini&s;h your papers in my hands. The ode on the Briti&s;h nation I hope to have done to day, and want a proof copy of that part of Stowe you de&s;ign for the pre&s;ent magazine, that it may be improved as far as po&s;&s;ible from your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Your papers are but ill tran&s;cribed. I agree with you as to St. Augu&s;tine's cave. I humbly intreat your an&s;wer, having not ta&s;ted any thing &s;ince Tue&s;day evening I came here; and my coat will be taken off my back for the charge of the bed, &s;o that I mu&s;t go into pri&s;on naked, which is too &s;hocking for me to think of.</P>

<P>The mi&s;eries of his confinement did not teach him di&s;cretion: he was relea&s;ed, but his wants were little abated, and he made u&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;graceful arts to excite charity: he &s;ometimes rai&s;ed &s;ub&s;criptions for non-exi&s;tent poems, and &s;ometimes employed his wife to give out that he was dying. He was afterwards engaged, at a very low rate, in the compilation of an hi&s;torical view of the tran&s;actions of Europe, by Mr. Henry of Reading; at which place his wife died. To &s;ignify his &s;orrow for her death, he tied a black ribbon round the neck of a lap-dog, which, to acquire the character of a man of ta&s;te, he u&s;ed to carry in his arms. After he left Read|ing, he grew more decent in his dre&s;s and behaviour; but his health was then declining, and in May 1749 he died in an ob&s;cure lodging near Shoe-lane, and was buried at the charge of the pari&s;h.</P></NOTE>, and many others,

render the followers of it, with re&s;pect to religion, to politics, and even to morality, altogether indifferent. Nor could he be ignorant of that mortifying depen|dence which the profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf expo&s;es men to, a profe&s;&s;ion that leads to no preferment, and for its
<PB N="161" REF="162">
mo&s;t laborious exertions confers no greater a reward than a &s;upply of natural wants.</P>
<P>Ralph, a writer of this cla&s;s, and who had formed &s;ome &s;uch connections as would have flattered the hopes of any man, was the tool of that party of which the late lord Melcombe laboured to be the head. To &s;erve the intere&s;ts of it, he wrote a periodical paper, and a voluminous hi&s;tory of England, fraught with &s;uch principles as he was required to di&s;&s;eminate. This man, in a pamphlet intitled <Q REND="inline">'The ca&s;e of authors by profe&s;&s;ion,'</Q> has enumerated all the evils that attend it, and &s;hewn it to be the la&s;t that a liberal mind would choo&s;e.</P>
<P>All this John&s;on knew and had duly weighed: the le&s;&s;er evils of an author's profe&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as a depen|dence on book&s;ellers, and a precarious income, he was able to endure, and the greater, that is to &s;ay, the pro&s;titution of his talents, he averted; for, whatever &s;acrifices of their principles &s;uch men as Waller, Dryden, and others, have made in their writings, or to whatever lengths they may have gone in panegyrics or adulatory addre&s;&s;es, his integrity was not to be warped: his religious and political opini|ons he retained and cheri&s;hed; and in a &s;ullen confi|dence in the &s;trength of his mental powers, di&s;dained to &s;olicit patronage by any of the arts in common u&s;e with writers of almo&s;t every denomination. That this firmne&s;s was not affected, will appear by a retro|&s;pect to the methods he took for the attainment of knowledge, and the &s;ettling his notions as to the great duties of life.</P>
<P>His cour&s;e of &s;tudy at the univer&s;ity was irregular and de&s;ultory, and &s;carcely determined as to its object.
<PB N="162" REF="163">
Mathematics and phy&s;ics he had but little reli&s;h for, from whence it may be inferred, that his natural powers had received comparatively but &s;mall improve|ment from an academical education. An habitual di&s;po&s;ition to thought and reflection enabled him how|ever upon his leaving it, to attain to that degree of im|provement which, in many minds, is not effected with|out inten&s;e application and labour; and the &s;entiments of piety which he had imbibed in his youth, directed him to tho&s;e &s;tudies, which, without attending to &s;ecular rewards, he thought of greate&s;t importance to his future happine&s;s. In conformity to this motive, he applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the Holy Scriptures, and the evidences of religion, to the writings of the fathers and of the Greek morali&s;ts, to eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil hi&s;tory, and to cla&s;&s;ical literature and philology.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e his mental exerci&s;es was a thorough conviction of the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion, an adherence to the doctrine and di&s;cipline of our e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and to that form of civil government which we number among the ble&s;&s;ings derived to us from the wi&s;dom and bravery of our ance&s;tors, with this farther advantage, that they rooted in his mind tho&s;e principles of religion, morality, and I will add, loyalty, that influenced his conduct during the remainder of his life.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of the fir&s;t, his religion, it had a tincture o enthu&s;ia&s;m, ari&s;ing, as is conjectured, from the fervou of his imagination, and the peru&s;al of St. Augu&s;tin and other of the fathers, and the writings of Kempi and the a&s;cetics, which prompted him to the employ ment of compo&s;ing meditations and devotional exer
<PB N="163" REF="164">
ci&s;es. It farther produced in him an habitual reverence for the name of God, which he was never known to utter but on proper occa&s;ions and with due re&s;pect, and operated on tho&s;e that were admitted to his con|ver&s;ation as a powerful re&s;traint of all profane di&s;cour&s;e, and idle di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of theological que&s;tions; and, la&s;tly, it in&s;pired him with that charity, meaning thereby a general concern for the welfare of all man|kind, without which we are told that all preten&s;ions to religion are vain.</P>
<P>To enable him at times to review his progre&s;s in life, and to e&s;timate his improvement in religion, he, in the year 1734, began to note down the tran&s;actions of each day, recollecting, as well as he was able, tho&s;e of his youth, and inter&s;per&s;ing &s;uch reflections and re&s;olutions as, under particular circum&s;tances, he was induced to make. This regi&s;ter, which he intitled <Q REND="inline">'Annales,'</Q> does not form an entire volume, but is contained in a variety of little books folded and &s;titched together by him&s;elf, and which were found mix|ed with his papers. Some &s;pecimens of the&s;e notanda have been lately printed with his prayers; but to warrant what I have &s;aid, re&s;pecting his religious cha|racter, I have &s;elected from the <Q REND="inline">'Annales,'</Q> and in&s;ert in the margin below, an earlier extract than any con|tained in that collection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><P>'Friday, Augu&s;t 27th,' [1734] '10 at night.

His moral character di&s;played it&s;elf in the &s;incerity of his friend&s;hips, his love of ju&s;tice and of truth, and his placability; of all which qualities, the te&s;timonies in his favour are innumerable. But as the character here propo&s;ed to be given him is not intended to palliate his errors in behaviour, truth obliges me to &s;ay, that his outward deportment was in many in&s;tan|ces a ju&s;t &s;ubject of cen&s;ure. Before his arrival in town, he was but little accu&s;tomed to free conver|&s;ation with his &s;uperiors, &s;o that that kind of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion he had been u&s;ed to pay them he &s;eemed to exact from others, and when it was refu&s;ed him he was petulant, captious, and dogged. His di&s;cour&s;e, which through life was of the didactic kind, was replete with original &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t correct terms, and in &s;uch language, that whoever could have heard and not &s;een him, would have thought him reading. For the plea&s;ure he com|municated to his hearers, he expected not the tribute of &s;ilence: on the contrary, he encouraged others, particularly young men, to &s;peak, and paid a due at|tention to what they &s;aid; but his prejudices were &s;o &s;trong and deeply rooted, more e&s;pecially again&s;t Scotchmen and whigs, that whoever thwarted him ran the ri&s;que of a &s;evere rebuke, or at be&s;t be|came entangled in an unplea&s;ant altercation.</P>
<P>He was &s;carce &s;ettled in town before this dogmatical behaviour, and his impatience of contradiction, became
<PB N="165" REF="166">
a part of his character, and deterred many per&s;ons of learning, who wi&s;hed to enjoy the delight of his con|ver&s;ation, from &s;eeking his acquaintance. There were not wanting tho&s;e among his friends who would &s;ome|times hint to him, that the conditions of free con|ver&s;ation imply an equality among tho&s;e engaged in it, which are violated whenever &s;uperiority is a&s;&s;umed: their reproofs he took kindly, and would in excu&s;e for what they called the pride of learning, &s;ay, that it was of the defen&s;ive kind. The repetition of the&s;e had, however, a great effect on him; they abated his preju|dices, and produced a change in his temper and man|ners that rendered him at length a de&s;irable companion in the mo&s;t polite circles.</P>
<P>In the le&s;&s;er duties of morality he was remi&s;s: he &s;lept when he &s;hould have &s;tudied, and watched when he &s;hould have been at re&s;t: his habits were &s;lovenly, and the neglect of his per&s;on and garb &s;o great as to render his appearance di&s;gu&s;ting. He was an ill hu&s;band of his time, and &s;o regardle&s;s of the hours of re&s;ection, that at two he might be found at break|fa&s;t, and at dinner at eight. In his &s;tudies, and I may add, in his devotional exerci&s;es, he was both inten&s;e and remi&s;s, and in the pro&s;ecution of his literary em|ployments, dilatory and ha&s;ty, unwilling, as him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed, to work, and working with vigour and ha&s;te<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his prayers page 184.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His indolence, or rather the delight he took in reading and reflection, rendered him aver&s;e to bodily exertions. He was ill made for riding, and took &s;o
<PB N="166" REF="167">
little plea&s;ure in it, that, as he once told me, he has fallen a&s;leep on his hor&s;e. Walking he &s;eldom prac|ti&s;ed, perhaps for no better rea&s;on, than that it requir|ed the previous labour of dre&s;&s;ing. In a word, mental occupation was his &s;ole plea&s;ure, and the knowledge he acquired in the pur&s;uit of it he was ever ready to com|municate: in which faculty he was not only excellent but expert; for, as it is related of lord Bacon by one who knew him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Works of Francis O&s;born, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> 8vo. 1673, page 151.</NOTE>, that <Q REND="inline">'in all companies he appeared a good proficient, if not a ma&s;ter, in tho&s;e arts entertained for the &s;ubject of every one's di&s;cour&s;e,'</Q>  and that <Q REND="inline">'his mo&s;t ca&s;ual talk de&s;erved to be written,'</Q> &s;o it may be &s;aid of John&s;on, that his conver&s;ation was ever &s;uited to the profe&s;&s;ion, condition, and capacity of tho&s;e with whom he talked.</P>
<P>Of a mind thus &s;tored it is &s;urely not too much to &s;ay, that it qualified the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it for many more important employments than the in&s;truction of non-adults in the elements of literature; yet &s;o humbly did he &s;eem to think of him&s;elf when he publi&s;hed the adverti&s;ement of his little academy at Edial, that to be able to e&s;tabli&s;h it, was the utmo&s;t of his ambition; but that hope failing, his nece&s;&s;ities drove him to London, and placed him in the &s;tation of life in which we are now to contemplate him.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned in a preceding page, that in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies he had formed a li&s;t of literary undertakings, on which, when time &s;hould &s;erve or occa&s;ion invite, he meant to exerci&s;e his pen: but &s;uch was the ver&s;atility of his temper, that of forty-nine articles which he had fixed
<PB N="167" REF="168">
on, not one appears to have engaged his future at|tention. Among the re&s;t he had purpo&s;ed to give a hi&s;tory of the revival of learning in Europe, and al&s;o a compari&s;on of philo&s;ophical and chri&s;tian mo|rality, by &s;entences collected from the morali&s;ts and fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide &s;upra, page 83, 84. in not.</NOTE>. The former of the&s;e, as it required the labour of deep re&s;earch, and the peru&s;al of a great variety of authors, was a work that we may &s;uppo&s;e he was deterred from by frequent reflections on the pains it would co&s;t him; but that he &s;hould abandon a work &s;o ea&s;y in the execution, and &s;o much to the credit of the religion he profe&s;&s;ed, as the latter, is not le&s;s to be wondered at than lamented.</P>
<P>The&s;e projects of John&s;on were mo&s;t of them re|&s;olved on in his earlier days, but it is not improbable that he was induced to give them up by the pro&s;pect of the gain that might ari&s;e from the publication of a new edition of Shake&s;peare, which it is certain he meditated, about the year 1745. To an undertak|ing of this kind the temptations were very &s;trong, for, be&s;ides that the former editors had fallen &s;hort in their endeavours to explain and &s;ettle the text, he had great rea&s;on to hope it would be well received, for at that time it was ob&s;ervable, that the ta&s;te of the public was refining, and that the lovers of &s;tage entertainments and dramatic literature had begun to nau&s;eate the tragedies and comedies of the la&s;t age, which were formed after French models, and to di&s;cern the beauties and excellencies of this au|thor.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">
That this hope was not ill-grounded, may rea|&s;onably be inferred from the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e many editions of this author that have appeared &s;ince the above time, of one whereof above eleven thou&s;and copies have been &s;old, and next, from the effects of Mr. Garrick's acting, which had revived the exhibition of Shake&s;peare's plays, and excited readers of every cla&s;s to the peru&s;al of them.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, the greate&s;t of John&s;on's temptations to this undertaking, &s;aving at all times his nece&s;&s;ities, was, a de&s;ire to di&s;play his &s;kill in Engli&s;h literature and rational critici&s;m in their wide&s;t extent, in both which requi&s;ites the deficiences of the former edi|tions were obvious. Of tho&s;e of the players and others, down to the year 1685, little in favour can be &s;aid: the fir&s;t that made any preten&s;ions to correctne&s;s was that of Rowe in 1709, and next to that, Mr. Pope's in 4to, 1723. Whatever other were the merits of the&s;e two per&s;ons, it is certain that neither of them was &s;ufficiently qualified for the ta&s;k he had undertaken; not that they wanted the power of di&s;cerning the ex|cellences of their author, or clearing his page of many corruptions that had long ob&s;cured his &s;en&s;e, but that they were deficient in that lower kind of literature, without which all endeavours to fix or explain the text of an old writer will ever be found to be vain.</P>
<P>To this kind of knowledge, as far as may be judged from the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, and indeed from the preface to his edition, Rowe had not the lea&s;t preten|&s;ion. Nor does it appear that Pope was at all con|ver&s;ant with, or that he under&s;tood the phra&s;eology
<PB N="169" REF="170">
of the writers contemporary with his author. So little was he u&s;ed to that kind of reading, that, as him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed, he had never heard of the Virgidemiarum of bi&s;hop Hall, a collection of the wittie&s;t and mo&s;t pointed &s;atires in our language, till it was &s;hewn to him, and that &s;o late in his life, that he could only expre&s;s his approbation of it by a wi&s;h that he had &s;een it &s;ooner. That vernacular erudition, contemptible as it has been repre&s;ented, is an indi&s;pen&s;able qualification for the re&s;toring or explaining the &s;en&s;e of corrupted or ob&s;o|lete authors, and even of tho&s;e more recent, is mo&s;t clearly evidenced in one ca&s;e by the later editions of our great dramatic poet, and in the other by Dr. Grey's edition of Hudibras, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance whereof, the many allu&s;ions to facts, circum&s;tances, and &s;itua|tions therein contained, mu&s;t for ever have remained unintelligible. Theobald was the fir&s;t of this cla&s;s of editors. For the purpo&s;e of publi&s;hing Shake&s;peare, he, in the preface to his fir&s;t edition, a&s;&s;erts, that he had read no fewer than eight hundred old Engli&s;h plays, be&s;ides hi&s;tories and novels to a great amount; and the &s;ame kind of &s;tudy has, with different degrees of a&s;&s;iduity, been pur&s;ued by others, even to the la&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>With the&s;e inducements, and the aid of two va|luable editions then extant, Theobald's and that of Sir Thomas Hanmer, John&s;on projected a new one, and, as a &s;pecimen of his abilities for the undertaking, publi&s;hed in the year 1745, <Q REND="inline">'Mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;erva|tions on the tragedy of Macbeth, with remarks on Sir Thomas Hanmer's edition of Shake&s;peare,'</Q> with propo&s;als for one by him&s;elf. The&s;e ob&s;ervations, as
<PB N="170" REF="171">
they go rather to adju&s;t the various readings, and &s;ettle the text by conjectural notes, than explain allu&s;ions, did not enough attract the notice of the public to induce him actually to engage in the work; they were however evidences of great &s;agacity, and drew from Dr. War|burton a te&s;timony that &s;et him above all other com|petitors; for thus does he &s;peak of John&s;on: <Q REND="inline">'As to all tho&s;e things which have been publi&s;hed under the tirles of E&s;&s;ays, Remarks, Ob&s;ervations, &amp;c. on Shake&s;peare, (if you except &s;ome critical notes on Macbeth, given as a &s;pecimen of a projected edition, and written as appears by a man of parts and genius) the re&s;t are ab&s;olutely below a &s;erious notice;'</Q> and John&s;on, who never forgot a kindne&s;s, remembered it by mentioning Warburton in terms of great re|&s;pect, as occa&s;ion offered, in his edition of Shake&s;peare, which he publi&s;hed many years after.</P>
<P>By this and other of John&s;on's writings, his reputa|tion as a &s;cholar and a philogi&s;t was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, that the book&s;ellers of greate&s;t opulence in the city, who had long meditated the publication of a dictionary, after the model of tho&s;e of France and the Academia della Cru&s;ca, looked upon him as a fit per&s;on to be employed in &s;uch an undertaking. He was at that time in the vigour of his life, and by the offer of a li|beral reward from men of &s;uch known worth as tho&s;e were who made it, was tempted to engage with them, and accordingly &s;et him&s;elf to compile that work, which, he living to complete it, does him and all con|cerned in it great honour.</P>
<P>Nor can we &s;uppo&s;e but that he was in a great mea|&s;ure incited to the pro&s;ecution of this laborious work
<PB N="171" REF="172">
by a reflection on the &s;tate of our language at this time, from the imperfection of all Engli&s;h dictionaries then extant, and the great di&s;tance in point of im|provement in this kind of literature between us and &s;ome of our neighbours. And here let me take oc|ca&s;ion, by an enumeration of the &s;everal authors that had gone before him, to point out the &s;ources of that intelligence which John&s;on's voluminous work contains.</P>

Thus within a yeere or two, they had gathered together a great volume, which (for the apt &s;imilitude betweene the good &s;cholers and diligent bees in gathering their waxe and honie into their hive) I called then their <HI>Aluearie,</HI> both for a memoriall, by whom it was made, and al&s;o by this name to in|courage other to the like diligence, for that they &s;hould not &s;ee their worthie prai&s;e for the &s;ame, vnworthilie drowned in obliuion. Not long after, diuers of our friends borrowing this our worke which we had thus contriued and wrought onelie for our owne priuate v&s;e, often and many waies moued me to put it in print for the common profit of others, and the publike propagation of the Latine tongue, or els to &s;uffer them to get it printed at their proper co&s;tes and charges. But I both vnwilling, and halfe a&s;hamed to haue our rude notes come abroad vnder the view of &s;o manie learned eies, &amp; e&s;peciallie finding no lea&s;ure from my prefixed &s;tudies for the poli&s;hing of the &s;ame, vtterlie denied their reque&s;t, vntil at length comming to London, the right wor&s;hipfull mai&s;ter <HI>Powle,</HI> &amp; mai&s;ter <HI>Garth,</HI> with other, &s;ingular &s;auourers of all good learning, and my verie e&s;peciall friends, with their importunate and earne&s;t exhortations had cleane ouercome my contrarie mind. Then immediatelie laieng a&s;ide all other &s;tudies, I was faine to &s;eeke for writers and workemen about the &s;ame, to make it readie for the pre&s;&s;e. Therefore I went to diuers of mine old pupils then being at the Innes of Court, delivering ech of them &s;ome part of their old di&s;continued worke to &s;ee it written faire againe, and for other peeces which I thought vnperfect, I gat certaine of the be&s;t &s;cholers of two or three &s;choles in London, to write after my pre&s;cription: but in the French tables, although I had before trauelled in diuers countries beyond the &s;eas, both for language and learning: yet not tru&s;ting to mine owne &s;kill, I v&s;ed the helpe of M. <HI>Chaloner,</HI> and M. <HI>Claudius.</HI> Upon this occa&s;ion I being much conuer&s;ant about the Innes of Court, and al&s;o &s;ome time occu|pied among &s;cholers in the &s;choles, there came vnto me a printer &s;hewing me <HI>Huloets</HI> dictionarie (which before I neuer &s;awe) and told me he intended to print it out of hand, augmented with our notes al&s;o if I would.

<P>To Baret's &s;ucceeded John Min&s;heu's Guide into the tongues, fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1617 in eleven, and in 1627 in nine languages, but with a con&s;i|derable increa&s;e in the number of radical words. In this the author undertakes to give the etymologies or derivations of the greater part of the words therein contained, but as they amount at the mo&s;t to no more than 14713, the work mu&s;t be deemed not &s;ufficiently copious.</P>
<P>In 1656, Thomas Blount a lawyer of the Inner Temple, publi&s;hed a &s;mall volume, intitled <Q REND="inline">'Glo&s;&s;o|graphia,
<PB N="173" REF="174">
or a dictionary interpreting &s;uch hard words, whether Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian, &amp;c. that are now u&s;ed in our refined Engli&s;h tongue, &amp;c.'</Q> in which the articles though few are well explained. This book, as far as it went, was of &s;ingular u&s;e to Edward Philips, a nephew and pupil of Milton, in the compilation of a dictionary by him publi&s;hed in folio, 1657, intitled <Q REND="inline">'The New World of Words,'</Q> which, as it is much more copious than that of Blount, and comprehends a great quantity of matter, mu&s;t be looked on as the ba&s;is of Engli&s;h lexicography.</P>
<P>Of technical as al&s;o of etymological dictionaries, many have long been extant, namely, The Inter|preter
<PB N="174" REF="175">
or Law Dictionary of Dr. Cowell a civilian, a Common-Law Dictionary of the above Thomas Blount, the Etymologicum of Junius, and another of Skinner, both well known and frequently referred to, and of the&s;e did John&s;on avail him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The dictionary of Nathan Bailey a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in a thick octavo volume, &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed with re&s;pect to the character and method of printing, as to contain more matter than could otherwi&s;e have been comprized in a vo|lume of that &s;ize. After it had pa&s;&s;ed many editions with improvements by the author him&s;elf, he medi|tated an enlargement of it, and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the
<PB N="175" REF="176">
mathematical part by Mr. Gordon, in the botanical by the famous gardener Philip Miller, and in the ety|mological by Mr. Lediard, a profe&s;&s;or of the modern languages, it was publi&s;hed in a folio &s;ize. The la&s;t improvement of it was by Dr. Jo&s;eph Nicoll Scott, who, of a di&s;&s;enting teacher had become a phy&s;ician and a writer for the book&s;ellers.</P>
<P>John&s;on, who before this time, together with his wife, had lived in ob&s;curity, lodging at different hou&s;es in the courts and alleys in and about the Strand and Fleet &s;treet, had, for the purpo&s;e of carrying on this arduous work, and being near the printers employed in it, taken a hand&s;ome hou&s;e in Gough &s;quare, and fitted up a room in it with de&s;ks and other accommo|dations for amanuen&s;es, who, to the number of five or &s;ix, he kept con&s;tantly under his eye. An interleaved copy of Bailey's dictionary in folio he made the repo|&s;itory of the &s;everal articles, and the&s;e he collected by ince&s;&s;ant reading the be&s;t authors in our language, in the practice whereof, his method was to &s;core with a black-lead pencil the words by him &s;elected, and give them over to his a&s;&s;i&s;tants to in&s;ert in their places. The books he u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a mi&s;erably ragged one, and all &s;uch as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to tho&s;e that lent them, were &s;o defaced as to be &s;carce worth owning, and yet, &s;ome of his friends were glad to receive and entertain them as curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that John&s;on had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in his work when he was informed, that the earl of Che&s;terfield had heard and &s;poken favourably of his de&s;ign. He had never till this time experi|enced
<PB N="176" REF="177">
the patronage of any other than book&s;ellers, and though he had but an indi&s;tinct idea of that of a nobleman, a reputed wit, and an accompli&s;hed courtier, and doubted whether he was to rate it among the happy incidents of his life, it might mean a liberal pre&s;ent or an hand&s;ome pen&s;ion to encourage him in the pro&s;ecution of the work; he therefore re&s;olved not to reject it by a &s;upercilious compari&s;on of his own talents with tho&s;e of his lord&s;hip, or to &s;light a favour which he was not able to e&s;timate. Accordingly, he in the year 1747, drew up and dedicated to lord Che&s;terfield, then a &s;ecretary of &s;tate, a plan of his dictionary, the manu&s;cript whereof he delivered to Mr. Whitehead the late laureat, who undertook to convey it to his lord&s;hip, but he having communicated it fir&s;t to another per&s;on, it pa&s;&s;ed through other hands be|fore it reached that to which it was immediately di|rected: the re&s;ult was an invitation from lord Che&s;ter|field to the author.</P>
<P>Never could there be a &s;tronger contra&s;t of characters than this interview produced: a &s;cholar and a courtier, the one ignorant of the forms and modes of addre&s;s, the other, to an affected degree, ac|compli&s;hed in both: the one in a manly and &s;enten|tious &s;tile directing his di&s;cour&s;e to a weighty &s;ubject; the other dreading to incur the imputation of pedantry, and by the interpo&s;ition of compliments and the intro|duction of new topics as artfully endeavouring to evade it. The acquaintance thus commenced was never im|proved into friend&s;hip. What his lord&s;hip thought of John&s;on we may learn from his letters to an illegi|timate &s;on, now extant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 220.</NOTE>. John&s;on was &s;o little plea&s;ed
<PB N="177" REF="178">
with his once &s;uppo&s;ed patron, that he forbore not ever after to &s;peak of him in terms of the greate&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>How far John&s;on was right in his opinion of this popular nobleman, or whether he is to be &s;u&s;pected of having re&s;ented more than he ought to have done, the coldne&s;s of his reception, or the di&s;appointment of his hopes, will be&s;t appear by a &s;urvey of his character, as it ari&s;es out of the memoirs of his life prefixed to his mi&s;cellaneous works, and the &s;entiments and prin|ciples which, for the in&s;truction of his &s;on, he, in a cour&s;e of letters to him, from time to time commu|nicated, and with the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude laboured to inculcate and enforce.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip's de&s;cent was from an illu&s;trious, though not a very ancient family. Being, as him&s;elf relates, rather neglected by his father, and in his tender years bereft of his mother, the care of his education devolved on his grandmother, the marchione&s;s of Halifax, a woman of exemplary virtue and di&s;cretion, who fearing, perhaps, the contagion of a public &s;emi|nary, kept him in her family, and with the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of in&s;tructors that &s;he could procure, conferred on him all the benefits that could be hoped for in a cour&s;e of dome&s;tic education.</P>
<P>At the age of eighteen he was &s;ent to Trinity hall, Cambridge, where, as he informs us, he had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s on his hands, for he &s;pent above an hour every day in &s;tudying the civil law, and as much in philo&s;ophy, and attended the mathemati|cal lectures of the blind man [profe&s;&s;or Saunder&s;on] &s;o that, adds he, I am now fully employed. But not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="178" REF="179">
this inten&s;e application to his &s;tudies, this hopeful young nobleman &s;eems to have brought from the univer&s;ity le&s;s of what all &s;uch &s;eminaries profe&s;s to teach, &s;ound learning and good morals, than a hatred of that pedantry and illiberality of manners, which, throughout his writings, he reprobates as the in&s;eparable concomitant of all academical in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>As I have not taken upon me the office of his lord|&s;hip's biographer, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with mention|ing only tho&s;e circum&s;tances of his life and conduct that may &s;erve to di&s;play his genuine character, and enable the world to determine whether it was &s;uch a one as a wi&s;e man would chu&s;e as a model for imitation, or the &s;tandard by which he would form his own.</P>
<P>After about two years &s;tay at the univer&s;ity, lord Stanhope, for that was then his only title, went abroad to travel, and at that enchanting place the Hague, began to be acquainted with the world. The college ru&s;t, which, if we may believe his panegyri&s;t, he con|tracted in the univer&s;ity during &s;o long a re&s;idence there, he found means to rub off, and exchanged for the poli&s;h of gaming, which rendered him the dupe of knaves and &s;harpers almo&s;t throughout his life, and this not from any real propen&s;ity to this pernicious vice, ari&s;ing either from avarice or the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e mental powers that make it a delight to many, but to acquire, what throughout his life he &s;eems to have above all things been de&s;irous of, the in&s;ipid cha|racter of a man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Nature, it mu&s;t be owned, had endowed him with fine parts, and the&s;e he cultivated with all the indu&s;try u&s;ually practi&s;ed by &s;uch as prefer the &s;emblance of
<PB N="179" REF="180">
what is really fit, ju&s;t, lovely, honourable, to the qua|lities them&s;elves; thus he had eloquence without learning, complai&s;ance without friend&s;hip, and gal|lantry without love.</P>
<P>Not much to his honour, he, in the year 1715, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be cho&s;en for a Corni&s;h borough, and took his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons, at an age when it was in the power of any &s;ingle member, by the &s;peaking of a very few words, to have turned him out of it. Upon a hint of his incapacity, occa&s;ioned by a pert &s;peech of his making, he had the prudence to quit the hou&s;e and retire to Paris, glad of an op|portunity of fini&s;hing his noviciate in a city that abounded with tho&s;e plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements that be&s;t &s;uit with a mind to which &s;tudy and the rational exerci&s;e of its faculties are labour.</P>
<P>Upon the death of his father in 1726, he &s;ucceeded to his title, and his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of peers. His &s;peeches in that a&s;&s;embly, which were, though flim&s;y, florid, gave him, as that &s;pecies of eloquence will ever do, the reputation of a fine orator; and in this he was &s;o confident, that he has not &s;crupled to confe&s;s, that he has &s;poken with great applau&s;e, as on the bill for reforming the calendar, on &s;ubjects that he under|&s;tood not. <Q REND="inline">'For my own part,' &s;ays he, 'I could ju&s;t as &s;oon have talked Celtic or Sclavonian to them [the lords] as a&s;tronomy, and they would have under&s;tood me full as well; &s;o I re&s;olved to do better than &s;peak to the purpo&s;e, and to plea&s;e in&s;tead of informing them;'</Q> and for this he gives as a rea&s;on, what per|haps will be found to be a true one, that every nu|merous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letters to his &s;on, number 215.</NOTE>
<PB N="180" REF="181">
merous a&s;&s;embly is a mob, and to &s;uch a one rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e are never to be talked.</P>
<P>In addition to his character of an orator and a &s;tate&s;|man, he was emulous of that of a poet, his preten&s;ions to which were founded on &s;undry little compo&s;itions in ver&s;e that from time to time appeared in collections of that kind; elegant it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed; but gene|rally immoral and oft times profane.</P>
<P>His di&s;&s;imulation, deep and refined as it was, did not lead him to profe&s;s any &s;incere regard to virtue or religion: the gro&s;&s;er immoralities he affects to &s;peak of with abhorrence; but &s;uch as might be practi&s;ed without the lo&s;s of health and reputation he &s;eemed to think there was no law again&s;t. He was therefore, if &s;ecret, vain in his amours, and though, &s;etting a&s;ide his mien, his per&s;on had little to recommend it, for he was low of &s;tature, had coar&s;e features, and a ca|daverous complexion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was al&s;o long-vi&s;aged and long-necked, but from the &s;houl|ders to the wai&s;t very &s;hort, which a wit once ob&s;erving, &s;aid, he was a giant cut down, alluding to the practice of cutting down &s;hips of war to render them more active.</NOTE>, his confidence in the pro&s;e|cution of them was &s;uch as expo&s;ed him to greater ri&s;ques of per&s;onal &s;afety than mo&s;t men would chu&s;e to run; and of this I &s;hall now produce an in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>A lady of high quality, and a relation of one who had the &s;tory from her own mouth and told it me, having been married &s;ome few years but never having brought her lord a child, was &s;urpri&s;ed one morning by a vi&s;it from lord Che&s;terfield, whom &s;he had frequently &s;een and conver&s;ed with at court. After the u&s;ual compli|ments
<PB N="181" REF="182">
had pa&s;&s;ed, his lord&s;hip in that ea&s;y gay &s;tyle which he &s;o &s;trongly recommends to his &s;on, gave her to under&s;tand, that he &s;hould be happy to form &s;uch a connection with her lady&s;hip, as it was more than probable might give being to an heir to the honours and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of that noble family into which &s;he had matched. I will not attempt to de&s;cribe the indigna|tion which the lady felt at &s;uch an unexampled in&s;tance of impudence as the propo&s;al indicated. She ro&s;e from her chair, and with all the dignity of in&s;ulted mode&s;ty, commanded this well-bred lover, this minion of the graces, to quit her hou&s;e, with this menace, <Q REND="inline">'Think your&s;elf well off, my lord, that for this affront I do not order my &s;ervants to pu&s;h you headlong out of doors.'</Q></P>
<P>It is a refinement in modern gallantry, but an affront to human policy, to recognize in public, by the un|qualified appellation of &s;on, tho&s;e to whom the laws of mo&s;t civilized countries deny not only that but the privilege of heirs; yet this has this &s;lave to forms and u&s;ages done in a &s;eries of letters to a young gentleman begotten by him out of wedlock, and in the life-time of one to whom we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e he once tendered him&s;elf, his honours, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and his heart. With a &s;olicitude for his welfare, commendable it mu&s;t be &s;aid in its general intention, he takes on him&s;elf to mold his per&s;on, to form his manners, and to furni&s;h his mind. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e particulars his lord&s;hip had great difficulties to encounter: the clay he had cho&s;en to work upon was &s;tiff, and re&s;i&s;ted the pla&s;tic touch: the boy was encumbered with fle&s;h, and na|ture had &s;o carele&s;sly compacted his limbs as &s;carcely

to leave them the power of flexure. In a word, in in|fancy he was &s;hapele&s;s, and in youth a looby. Never did a &s;he-bear with more anxious a&s;&s;iduity labour to lick her cub into &s;hape than this fond parent did to correct the errors of nature in the formation of this his darling: the head, the &s;houlders and the hands, were, by turns, the objects of his care; but the legs and feet &s;eem to have engaged mo&s;t of his attention: the&s;e upon his being &s;ent abroad, were committed to the care of a dancing-ma&s;ter at Paris, who&s;e in&s;tructions he e&s;ti|mates at a higher rate than the precepts of Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 215.</NOTE>.

<P>Farther to initiate him into vice, he recommends to him the <Q REND="inline">'turning over men by day and women by night,'</Q> for thus it plea&s;es him to render the pre|cept Nocturna ver&s;ate manu ver&s;ate diurna<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 217.</NOTE>; and with matchle&s;s effrontery and total di&s;regard for the per&s;onal &s;afety of him whom he is in&s;tructing, advi&s;es him, in effect, to ri&s;que being run through the body, or the breaking his neck out of a bed-chamber win|dow, by commencing an intrigue with a new-married and virtuous young lady.

<P>I have received two letters from you, one written in Latin, the other in French, which I take in good part, and will you to exerci&s;e that practice of learning often, for that will &s;tand you in mo&s;t &s;tead in that profe&s;&s;ion of life that you are born to live in.

Let your fir&s;t action be the lifting up of your mind to Almighty God by hear|ty prayer, and feelingly dige&s;t the words you &s;peak in prayer with continual meditation and think|ing of him to whom you pray, and of the matter for which you pray, and u&s;e this as an ordinary, at, and at an ordinary hour, whereby the time it&s;elf will put you in remembrance to do that which you are accu&s;tomed to do. In that time apply your &s;tudy to &s;uch hours as your di&s;creet ma&s;ter doth a&s;&s;ign you, earne&s;tly, and the time I know he will &s;o limit as &s;hall be both &s;ufficient for your learning, and &s;afe for your health: and mark the &s;en&s;e and

the matter of that you read, as well as the words; &s;o &s;hall you both enrich your tongue with words, and your wit with matter, and judgment will grow as years grow in you. Be humble and obedient to your ma&s;ter; for unle&s;s you frame your&s;elf to obey others, yea and feel in your&s;elf what obedi|ence is, you &s;hall never be able to teach others how to obey you. Be courteous of ge&s;ture, and affable to all men, with diver&s;ity of reverence according to the dignity of the per&s;on: there is nothing that winneth &s;o much with &s;o little co&s;t. U&s;e moderate diet, &s;o as after your meat you may find your wit fre&s;her and not duller, and your body more lively and not more heavy. Seldom drink wine, and yet &s;ometime do, le&s;t being inforced to drink upon the &s;udden you &s;hould find your&s;elf inflamed. U&s;e ex|erci&s;e of body, but &s;uch as is without peril of your joints or bones: it will increa&s;e your force and en|large your breath.

Think upon every word that you will &s;peak before you utter it, and remember how nature hath rampired up (as it were) the tongue with teeth, lips, yea and hair without the lips, and all betokening reins or bridles for the loo&s;e u&s;e of that member. Above all things tell no untruth, no not in trifles. The cu&s;tom of it is naught, and let it not &s;atisfy you that for a time the hearers take it for a truth, for after it will be known as it is, to your &s;hame, for there cannot be a greater reproach to a gentleman than to be account|ed a liar.

</LETTER>
<P>The hopeful documents contained in this in&s;titute of politene&s;s, lord Che&s;terfield's letters to his &s;on, failed in a great mea&s;ure of their end. His lord&s;hip's intere&s;t with the mini&s;try, founded on a &s;eat in par|liament, which, though a great declaimer again&s;t corruption, he bought as he would have done a hor&s;e, procured him the appointment of an envoy-extraor|dinary to the court of Dre&s;den. We find not that the young man had any female attachments, but that on the contrary he had more grace than his father. He married a woman, who becoming a widow, and pro|voked by real or imaginary ill treatment of lord Che&s;|terfield, publi&s;hed tho&s;e letters, which, had he been living, he would have given almo&s;t any thing to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, as they &s;hew him to have been a man devoted to plea&s;ure, and actuated by vanity, without religious, moral, or political principles, a &s;matterer in learning, and in manners a coxcomb.</P>
<P>Such was the per&s;on whom John&s;on in the &s;implicity of his heart cho&s;e for a patron, and was betrayed to ce|lebrate as the Mecaenas of the age; and &s;uch was the opinion he had conceived of his &s;kill in literature, his love of eloquence, and his zeal for the intere&s;ts of learn|ing, that he approached him with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect, and that he might not err in his manner of expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="189" REF="190">
it, the &s;tile and language of that addre&s;s which his plan includes are little le&s;s than adulatory. With a view farther to &s;ecure his patronage, he waited on him in per&s;on, and was honoured by him with con|ver&s;ations on the &s;ubject of literature, in which he found him &s;o deficient as gave him occa&s;ion to repent the choice he had made, and to &s;ay, that the labour he had be&s;towed in his addre&s;s to lord Che&s;terfield re&s;em|bled that of gilding a rotten po&s;t, that he was a wit among lords and a lord among wits, and that his accompli&s;hments were only tho&s;e of a dancing|ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is pretty well under&s;tood that, as John&s;on had cho&s;en this nobleman for his patron, he meant to have dedicated to him his work, and he might po&s;&s;ibly have done &s;o, even after he had di&s;covered that he was un|worthy of that honour; but the earl's behaviour in a particular in&s;tance prevented him. John&s;on one day made him a morning vi&s;it, and being admitted into an anti-chamber, was told, that his lord&s;hip was engaged with a gentleman, but would &s;ee him as &s;oon as the gentleman went. It was not till after an hour's wait|ing that John&s;on di&s;covered that this gentleman was Colley Cibber, which he had no &s;ooner done, than he ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e with a re&s;olution never to enter it more.</P>
<P>What impre&s;&s;ion John&s;on's vi&s;its made upon his lord&s;hip, we are told by the latter in a character of him, which, as well for the &s;ake of the one as the other, I wi&s;h to be held forth to the public. Speaking, as his lord&s;hip is ever doing, to his &s;on of the engaging manners, the plea&s;ing attentions, the graces, with the re&s;t of that non&s;en&s;e which was ever floating in his
<PB N="190" REF="191">
mind, he thus delineates the per&s;on, who, in language the mo&s;t nervous and elegant had endeavoured to ren|der him re&s;pectable in the republic of letters, and in that particular to do for him what he was never able to do for him&s;elf. <Q REND="inline">'There is a man who&s;e moral cha|racter, deep learning, and &s;uperior parts, I acknow|ledge, admire, and re&s;pect; but whom it is &s;o impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to love, that I am almo&s;t in a fever when|ever I am in his company. His figure (without being deformed) &s;eems made to di&s;grace or ridicule the common &s;tructure of the human body. His legs and arms are never in the po&s;ition which, according to the &s;ituation of his body, they ought to be in, but con&s;tantly employed in committing acts of ho&s;tility upon the graces. He throws any where, but down his throat, whatever he means to drink, and only mangles what he means to carve. Inattentive to all the regards of &s;ocial life, he mi&s;-times and mi&s;-places every thing. He di&s;putes with heat, and indi&s;cri|minately, mindle&s;s of the rank, character, and &s;itua|tion of them with whom he di&s;putes: ab&s;olutely ignorant of the &s;everal gradations of familiarity and re&s;pect, he is exactly the &s;ame to his &s;uperiors, his equals, and his inferiors; and therefore, by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, ab&s;urd to two of the three. Is it po&s;&s;ible to love &s;uch a man? No. The utmo&s;t I can do for him, is, to con&s;ider him as a re&s;pectable Hottentor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter 212.</NOTE>.'</Q> Had Socrates been living, and not learned, as we are told he did in his old age, to dance, lord Che&s;terfield had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame cen&s;ure on him.</P>
<P>John&s;on was, by this time, able to determine on a fact which, in his addre&s;s to this nobleman, he ex|pre&s;&s;es
<PB N="191" REF="192">
a doubt of, viz. whether the unexpected di&s;tinc|tion his lord&s;hip had &s;hewn him, was to be rated among the happy incidents of his life: he was now convinced that it was not, and that, far from every thing like en|couragement or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or what el&s;e is included in the idea of patronage, his lord&s;hip's approbation of his plan was to be the only recompence for the labour of drawing it out and reducing it to form. Be&s;ides de|claring, whenever occa&s;ion required it, his mi&s;take in &s;uppo&s;ing that lord Che&s;terfield was either a judge of or a friend to literature, he expre&s;&s;ed in a letter to his lord&s;hip him&s;elf his re&s;entment of the affront he had received at his la&s;t vi&s;it, and concluded it with a formal renunciation for ever of his lord&s;hip's pa|tronage.</P>
<P>If John&s;on had reflected a moment on the little effect likely to be produced by a letter in which he pro|fe&s;&s;ed to reject that which he could not retain, he would never have wrote it. Tho&s;e evils which cannot be reme|died mu&s;t be borne with patience, and to re&s;ent injuries when we cannot enforce redre&s;s, is to give our adver&s;aries an occa&s;ion of triumph: lord Che&s;terfield knew this, and made no reply: when the dictionary was com|pleted and about to be publi&s;hed, he wrote two e&s;&s;ays in a periodical paper, intitled <Q REND="inline">'The World,'</Q> that contain &s;ome forced compliments of the author, which being mentioned to John&s;on he rejected with &s;corn.</P>
<P>Further to appea&s;e him, his lord&s;hip &s;ent two per|&s;ons, the one a &s;pecious but empty man, Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the tallne&s;s of his

per&s;on than for any e&s;timable qualities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This per&s;on who is now at re&s;t in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, was, when living, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of long Sir Thomas Ro|bin&s;on. He was a man of the world or rather of the town, and a great pe&s;t to per&s;ons of high rank or in office. He was very trouble&s;ome to the late duke of Newca&s;tle, and when in his vi&s;its to him he was told that his Grace was gone out, would de&s;ire to be admitted to look at the clock, or to play with a monkey that was kept in the hall, in hopes of being &s;ent for in to the duke. This he had &s;o frequently done, that all in the hou&s;e were tired of him. At length it was concerted among the &s;ervants that he &s;hould receive a &s;ummary an&s;wer to his u&s;ual que&s;tions, and ac|cordingly at his next coming, the porter as &s;oon as he had open|ed the gate and without waiting for what he had to &s;ay, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">'Sir, his Grace is gone out, the clock &s;tands, and the monkey is dead.'</Q></P></NOTE>; the other an eminent painter now living. The&s;e were in&s;tructed to apologize for his lord&s;hip's treatment of him, and to make him tenders of his future friend&s;hip and patro|nage. Sir Thomas, who&s;e talent was flattery, was profu&s;e in his commendations of John&s;on and his writings, and declared that were his circum&s;tances other than they were, him&s;elf would &s;ettle five hun|dred pounds a year on him. <Q REND="inline">'And who are you,' a&s;ked John&s;on, 'that talk thus liberally?' 'I am,' &s;aid the other, 'Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, a York&s;hire baronet.' 'Sir,' replied John&s;on, 'if the fir&s;t peer of the realm were to make me &s;uch an offer, I would &s;hew him the way down &s;tairs.'</Q></P>
<P>No one will commend this manner of de|clining an intentional kindne&s;s, even where the &s;incerity of the intention might be doubtful, but the rejecting it with a menace was both un|nece&s;&s;ary and in&s;olent. The pride of independence
<PB N="193" REF="196">
was mo&s;t &s;trong in John&s;on at tho&s;e periods of his life when his wants were greate&s;t, and though at other times he would &s;ubject him&s;elf to great obliga|tions, he was uniform, except only in one in&s;tance, in an opinion that an offer of pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance was an in&s;ult, and not &s;eldom rejected it with &s;uch indig|nation, that were I to characteri&s;e it more particularly, I &s;hould do it by an allu&s;ion to the following apologue: A gardener's dog had fallen into a well and was una|ble to get out: his ma&s;ter pa&s;&s;ing by, and &s;eeing his di&s;tre&s;s, put down his arm to &s;ave him: the dog bit his hand, and the gardener left him to drown.</P>
<P>The unea&s;ine&s;s which John&s;on felt, at the time when he wrote the above-mentioned letter, gave way to a call of his friend Garrick, who in the &s;ame year, 1747, was, by a &s;eries of occurrences, become ma&s;|ter of Drury-lane theatre. I was never much con|ver&s;ant with the hi&s;tory of the &s;tage, and therefore can give but a &s;light account of an event, which, at that time, intere&s;ted many, and was deemed a very impor|tant one. Mr. Fleetwood's extravagance had re|duced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking out for &s;ome one or more per&s;ons to whom, for an adequate con&s;idera|tion, he might relinqui&s;h his intere&s;t in the patent. At that time a man of the name of Lacy had attracted the notice of the town by a competition with orator Henley, which he began at the great room in York buildings, with a &s;atirical di&s;cour&s;e of great licence, which he adverti&s;ed by the name of Peter's vi&s;itation. The liberties he had taken with the clergy and the principal officers of &s;tate in this ludicrous di&s;cour&s;e gave great
<PB N="194" REF="197">
offence: he was &s;eized, dealt with as a vagrant, and, in &s;hort, &s;ilenced. This man had lived among play|ers, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand &s;tage-manage|ment, and had &s;ome friends. Mr. Garrick had many, and tho&s;e opulent men: three of them, Mr. Draper the partner of Mr. Ton&s;on the book&s;eller, Mr. Clut|terbuck a mercer, and Mr. Samuel Sharpe one of the &s;urgeons of Guy's ho&s;pital, negociated a partner&s;hip between tho&s;e two per&s;ons, and by purcha&s;ing of them and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to di&s;po&s;e of what are called renters' &s;hares, enabled them to buy out Fleetwood, and before the commencement of the acting &s;ea&s;on, they were be|come joint-patentees of the theatre above-mentioned.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick's province in the management was to appoint the plays and to ca&s;t the parts; Lacy's was to &s;uperintend the workmen and &s;ervants, to order the &s;cenery, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of arti&s;ts, to adju&s;t the ornaments and decorations. It was their re&s;o|lution to bani&s;h from their &s;tage, pantomimes and all grote&s;que repre&s;entations, and to exhibit &s;uch only as a rational and judicious audience might be &s;uppo&s;ed inclined to approve.</P>
<P>To notify this their intention to the town, it &s;eemed to them that a prologue was nece&s;&s;ary: John&s;on was ea&s;ily prevailed upon by Mr. Garrick to write one, and at the opening of the theatre in 1747, it was &s;po|ken by the latter in a manner that did equal honour to the author and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Prologues are addre&s;&s;es from the &s;tage to the people, and either re&s;pect merely the drama that is to follow, or are of more general import &s;etting forth to the audience the views and de&s;igns of managers,
<PB N="195" REF="198">
their anxiety to plea&s;e, and the methods by which they hope to obtain the favour of the public: the&s;e latter are for the mo&s;t part occa&s;ional, and adapted to &s;uch circum&s;tances as the opening a new theatre, a change of management, or any other of tho&s;e great theatrical revolutions in which the players affect to think all men as much intere&s;ted as them&s;elves. In the addre&s;&s;es of this kind the powers of wit &s;eem to have been nearly exhau&s;ted: &s;ometimes the audience has been cajoled, at others, betrayed into good humour; and by the help of allegory, the &s;tage has been made to re&s;emble every thing unlike it. One poet feigns that the town is a &s;ea, the playhou&s;e a &s;hip, the manager the captain, the players &s;ailors, and the orange-girls powder-monkies; and Mr. Garrick, in one of his prologues, would make his audience believe, that his theatre is a tavern, him&s;elf the ma&s;ter, the players waiters, and his entertainment wines &s;uited to all palates: one of his liquors, in particular, he &s;trongly recommends, and calls Shake&s;peare, which that he may be con&s;tantly able to &s;upply, he &s;ays it is<Q><L>&mdash;his wi&s;h, his plan,</L>

<L>Bardolph is gin, and Pi&s;tol aqua-vitae.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>John&s;on's prologue is of a very different ca&s;t. It is a &s;ober, rational, and manly appeal to the good
<PB N="196" REF="199">
&s;en&s;e and candour of the audience, and contains a brief hi&s;tory of theatric repre&s;entations from the time of Shake&s;peare and Jon&s;on to their decline, when, as he &s;ays, the writers of pantomime and &s;ong had confirmed the &s;way of folly. It &s;tates the hard&s;hips which tho&s;e lye under, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to furni&s;h entertainment for the public, in being obliged to watch the wild vici&s;|&s;itudes of ta&s;te, and exhorts the hearers to patronize virtue and reviving &s;en&s;e.</P>

<P>This ma&s;terly and &s;pirited addre&s;s failed in a great mea&s;ure of its effect; the town, it is true, &s;ubmitted to the revival of Shake&s;peare's plays, recommended as they were by the exqui&s;ite acting of Mr. Garrick; but in a few winters they di&s;covered an impatience for pantomimes and ballad-farces, and were indulged with them. From that time Mr. Garrick gave up the hope of correcting the public ta&s;te, and at length be|came &s;o indifferent about it, that he once told me, that if the town required him to exhibit the <Q REND="inline">'Pilgrim's Progre&s;s'</Q> in a drama, he would do it.</P>
<P>Two years after, the management of Drury-lane theatre being in the hands of his friends, John&s;on be|thought him&s;elf of bringing his tragedy on the &s;tage. It was not only a juvenile compo&s;ition, but was written before he had become conver&s;ant with Shake&s;peare, indeed before he had ever read Othello, and having now, for more than ten years, lain by him, in which time his judgment had been growing to maturity, he
<PB N="199" REF="202">
&s;et him&s;elf to revi&s;e and poli&s;h it, taking to his a&s;&s;i&s;|tance Mr. Garrick, who&s;e experience of &s;tage decorum, and the mechanic operation of incidents and &s;entiments on the judgment and pa&s;&s;ions of an audience, was, by long attention, become very great. With the&s;e ad|vantages and all tho&s;e others which Mr. Garrick's zeal prompted him to &s;upply, &s;uch as magnificent &s;cenery, &s;plendid and well-cho&s;en dre&s;&s;es, and a di&s;tri|bution of the principal parts, him&s;elf taking a very active one, to the be&s;t performers then living, namely, Barry, Mrs. Cibber and Mrs. Pritchard; it was, in the winter of the year 1749, pre&s;ented to a polite, a numerous, and an unprejudiced audience. Never was there &s;uch a di&s;play of ea&s;tern magnificence as this &s;pectacle exhibited, nor ever were fine moral &s;enti|ments more &s;trongly enforced by correct and ener|getic utterance and ju&s;t action, than in the repre&s;enta|tion of this laboured tragedy; but the diction of the piece was cold and philo&s;ophical; it came from the head of the writer, and reached not the hearts of the hearers. The con&s;equence whereof was, that it was received with cold applau&s;e, and having reached to a ninth night's performance, was laid by. During the repre&s;entation John&s;on was behind the &s;cenes, and thinking his character of an author required upon the occa&s;ion &s;ome di&s;tinction of dre&s;s, he appeared in a gold-laced wai&s;tcoat.</P>
<P>The truth of the above a&s;&s;ertion, as to the language of this tragedy, is to be judged of by the peru&s;al of it; for, notwith&s;tanding its ill &s;ucce&s;s as a dramatic repre&s;entation, John&s;on found his account in giving it to the world as a poem. Of the fable, the cha|racters,
<PB N="200" REF="203">
and the &s;entiments, it is be&s;ide my purpo&s;e to &s;peak; they are al&s;o now open to examination. It is neverthele&s;s worthy of a remark, that the author has &s;hewn great judgment in deviating from hi&s;to|rical verity, as will appear by a compari&s;on of the drama with the &s;tory as related by Knolles, and abridged in a foregoing page; for whereas the hi&s;to|rian de&s;cribes Irene as endowed with the perfections as well of the mind as of the body, and relates that &s;he was an innocent victim to the ferocity of a tyrant, John&s;on thought that &s;uch a cata&s;trophe was too &s;hock|ing for repre&s;entation, and has varied the narrative by making the lady renounce her religion, and &s;ubjecting her to the &s;u&s;picion of being a joint con&s;pirator in a plot to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the Sultan; but of which he is afterwards convinced &s;he is innocent.</P>
<P>In thus altering the &s;tory, it mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that much of its beauty is de&s;troyed, and the character of Mahomet repre&s;ented with none of tho&s;e terrible graces that dignify the narrative: his public love and command over him&s;elf are anni|hilated, and he is exhibited as a tyrant and a vo|luptuary.</P>
<P>The world &s;oon formed an opinion of the merit of Irene, which has never fluctuated: a repre&s;entation during nine nights, was as much as a tragedy which excited no pa&s;&s;ion could claim; for, however excel|lent its precepts, and however correct its language, that it wants tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;able qualities in the drama, intere&s;t and pathos, cannot be denied. We read it, admit every po&s;ition it advances, commend it, lay it by, and forget it: our attention is not awakened by any eminent beauties, for its merit is uniform through|out:
<PB N="201" REF="204">
all the per&s;onages, good or bad, are philo&s;ophers: tho&s;e who execute and tho&s;e who i&s;&s;ue the orders talk the &s;ame language: the characters cau&s;e no anxiety, for the virtuous are &s;uperior to all mortal calamity, and the vicious beneath our care: the fate of Irene, though deplorable, is ju&s;t; notwith&s;tanding &s;he &s;uffers by a fal&s;e accu&s;ation, her apo&s;tacy and treachery to her friend de&s;erve puni&s;hment: the morality, it is needle&s;s to &s;ay of John&s;on's &s;pontaneous productions, is excellent; but how were unimpa&s;&s;ioned precepts to make their way alone, where variety, bu&s;ine&s;s and plot are always expected? where lively non&s;en&s;e and pa|thetic imbecillity often &s;ucceed again&s;t the conviction of rea&s;on? Or how could it be hoped that frigid vir|tue could attract tho&s;e who &s;uffer their pity to be ea&s;ily moved either by the hero or the villain, if he has the addre&s;s fir&s;t to engage their pa&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>Of the expectations that John&s;on had entertained of the &s;ucce&s;s of his tragedy, no conjecture can now be formed. If they are to be judged of by his out|ward demeanour after the town had con&s;igned it to ob|livion, they were not very &s;anguine; indeed the receipt of three nights mu&s;t have afforded him &s;ome con&s;o|lation; and we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that he increa&s;ed the emolument thence ari&s;ing, by the &s;ale of the copy. We are therefore not to impute it to the di&s;appointment of a hope that the play would be better received than it was, that in the winter of the &s;ame year he publi&s;hed another imitation of Juvenal, viz. of his tenth &s;atire, with the title of <Q REND="inline">'The vanity of human wi&s;hes;'</Q> the &s;ubject whereof, as it is an enumeration of the evils to which mankind are expo&s;ed, could not, at any period of his life, have been other than a
<PB N="202" REF="205">
tempting one. Pur&s;uing the track of his author, he expatiates on the mi&s;eries that await empire, grandeur, wealth, and power, and the di&s;appointments that fru&s;trate the hopes of ambition, learning, eloquence, and beauty; in all which in&s;tances he has been able to point out examples the mo&s;t &s;triking and ap|po&s;ite.</P>
<P>The poem concludes with an an&s;wer to an enquiry that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the peru&s;al of the foregoing part of it, viz. what are the con&s;olations that human life affords? or, in other words, in whom or on what is a virtuous man to re&s;t his hope? the re&s;olution of this que&s;tion is contained in the follow|ing lines, which for dignity of &s;entiment, for pious in&s;truction, and purity of &s;tyle, are hardly to be equalled by any in our language.<Q><L>Where then &s;hall hope and fear their objects find?</L>

<P>In the following year, it having been di&s;covered, that a grand-daughter of Milton was living, Mr. Garrick was prevailed on to permit the repre&s;enta|tion of the Ma&s;que of Comus at his theatre, for her benefit. Upon this occa&s;ion, John&s;on, forgetting the enmity which he had always borne towards Milton, wrote a prologue, wherein he calls the attention of the audience to his memory, and without imputing to his de&s;cendant any other merit than indu&s;trious poverty and conjugal fidelity, implores them to crown de&s;ert beyond the grave.</P>
<P>John&s;on's beneficence was of the mo&s;t diffu&s;ive kind: Di&s;tre&s;s was the general motive, and merit, whether in the object or any to whom he claimed re|lation, the particular incentive to it. There was living at this time, a man of the name of De Groot, a painter by profe&s;&s;ion, and no contemptible arti&s;t, who, after having travelled over England, and at low prices painted as many per&s;ons as could be per|&s;uaded to &s;it to him, &s;ettled in London, and became reduced to poverty: him Oldys, or &s;ome one other of his friends, introduced to John&s;on, who found out
<PB N="204" REF="207">
by his conver&s;ation that he was a de&s;cendant of Grotius; and thereupon exerting his intere&s;t in his behalf, he procured for him an admi&s;&s;ion into the Charterhou&s;e, in which comfortable retreat he died.</P>
<P>John&s;on was all this while working at the dictio|nary, having to a&s;&s;i&s;t him a number of young per&s;ons who&s;e employment it was to di&s;tribute the articles with &s;ufficient &s;paces for the definitions, which it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern are of his own compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, &s;ome were young men of parts, others mere drudges. Among the former was one of the name of Shiells, a Scotchman, the author of a poem in blank ver&s;e, intitled <Q REND="inline">'Beauty,'</Q> and al&s;o of a collec|tion of the lives of the poets, in four volumes, which, for a gratuity of ten guineas, Theophilus Cibber &s;uffered to be printed with his name, a book of no authority other than what it derives from Win|&s;tanley, Langbaine, and Jacob, and in other re&s;pects of little worth; but concerning which it is fit that the following fact &s;hould be made known: Cibber at the time of making this bargain, was under confine|ment for debt in the king's-bench pri&s;on, and with a view to deceive the public into a belief that the book was of his father's writing, it was concerted between the negotiators of it and him&s;elf to &s;uppre&s;s his chri&s;|tian name, and that it &s;hould be printed as a work of Mr. Cibber.</P>
<P>The inten&s;e application with which he was obliged to pur&s;ue his work, deprived John&s;on of many of the plea&s;ures he mo&s;t delighted in, as namely, reading in his de&s;ultory manner, and the conver&s;ation of his friends. It al&s;o increa&s;ed his con&s;titutional melan|choly, and at times excited in him a loathing of that
<PB N="205" REF="208">
employment to which he could not but look upon him&s;elf as doomed by his nece&s;&s;ities. The &s;um for which he had &s;tipulated with the book&s;ellers, was by the terms of the agreement, to be paid as the work went on, and was indeed his only &s;upport. Be|ing thus compelled to &s;pend every day like the pa&s;t, he looked on him&s;elf as in a &s;tate of mental bondage, and reflecting that while he was thus employed, his be&s;t faculties lay dormant, was unwillingly willing to work.</P>
<P>And here we cannot but reflect on that inertne&s;s and laxity of mind which the neglect of order and regularity in living, and the ob&s;ervance of &s;tated hours, in &s;hort, the wa&s;te of time, is apt to lead men to: this was the &s;ource of John&s;on's mi&s;ery through|out his life; all he did was by fits and &s;tarts, and he had no genuine impul&s;e to action, either corporal or mental. That the compilation of &s;uch a work as he was engaged in, was nece&s;&s;arily productive of that languor, which, in the pro&s;ecution of it he manife&s;ted, is by no means clear: all employments, all occupa|tions whatever, are intrin&s;ically indifferent, and excite neither pain nor plea&s;ure, but as the mind is di&s;|po&s;ed towards them. Fame, mere po&s;thumous fame has engaged men to &s;imilar undertakings, and they have pur&s;ued them with zeal and even delight. Canne, the editor of a bible printed in 1664, &s;pent many years in collecting parallel pa&s;&s;ages in the Old and New Te&s;tament, to &s;uch a number as to croud the margin of the book, and in the preface thereto he declares, that it was the mo&s;t delightful employment of his life; and what but a real plea&s;ure in that kind of labour,
<PB N="206" REF="209">
and the con&s;ideration of its benefit to mankind, could be the inducement with &s;uch a man as Hoff|man to compile a lexicon more than twice as volumi|nous as that of John&s;on?</P>
<P>And, to &s;peak more at large, viz. of men who have benefited the world by their literary labours, avowing as their motive the de&s;ire of gain, we find not all infected with that di&s;ea&s;e, which as it affected John&s;on, may almo&s;t be &s;aid to have converted all his mental nutriment to poi&s;on: on the contrary, there have been many who mixed with the world, and by a good u&s;e of their time, were capable of great application and enjoying the benefits of &s;o|ciety; and of the&s;e I &s;hall mention three per&s;ons, his contemporaries, men of very different characters from each other; all authors by profe&s;&s;ion, and of great eminence in literature.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was the reverend Dr. Thomas Birch, a divine of the church of England, but originally a quaker. In his youth he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of reading, and being indulged in it by his father, be|came &s;ucce&s;&s;ively u&s;her to two &s;chools in which the &s;ons of quakers were educated. He married at the age of twenty-three; but in le&s;s than a year became a widower. Having had the happine&s;s of a recom|mendation to Sir Philip Yorke, then attorney-general, and being honoured with his favour and patronage, he, in 1730, entered into holy orders, and was pre|&s;ented to a rectory and al&s;o to a vicarage in Glouce&s;|ter&s;hire. Soon after this, in conjunction with the reverend Mr. Bernard, the well-known Mr. John Lockman, and Mr. George Sale the tran&s;lator of the
<PB N="207" REF="210">
Koran, he compiled a general biographical dictionary in ten volumes in folio, including therein a tran&s;lation of that of Bayle, and collected and publi&s;hed Thur|loe's &s;tate papers, in &s;even folio volumes, and was the editor of lord Bacon's, Mr. Boyle's, and arch|bi&s;hop Tillot&s;on's works, as al&s;o of the pro&s;e writings of Milton, and the mi&s;cellaneous pieces of Sir Walter Raleigh, and the works of Mrs. Elizabeth Cock|burn. He was fir&s;t a fellow of and afterwards &s;ecre|tary to the royal &s;ociety, and wrote a hi&s;tory thereof. In 1753, the Mari&s;chal college at Aberdeen confer|red on him the degree of doctor in divinity, and, the year after, he received the &s;ame honour from archbi&s;hop Herring. The above is but a partial enumeration of his publications, for he wrote the lives of Henry prince of Wales, of Bacon, Boyle, Milton, and Tillot&s;on, and other per&s;ons, and many tracts not here noticed. In the mid&s;t of all this em|ployment, Dr. Birch was to be &s;een, at home, at the Royal and Antiquarian &s;ocieties, at Sion college, at the academy of ancient mu&s;ic, which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand, at Tom's coffee-hou&s;e in Devereux court; in &s;hort, in all places where a clergyman might with propriety ap|pear. Nor was this all; he found time for the exer|ci&s;e of walking, before many people were &s;tirring. I have been with him at nine in a winter's morning, and have found him ju&s;t returned from an excur&s;ion of &s;ome miles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I heard him once relate, that he had the curio&s;ity to mea&s;ure the circuit of London by a perambulation thereof: the account he gave was to this effect: He &s;et out from his hou&s;e in the Strand towards Chel&s;ea, and having reached the bridge beyond the water|works, he directed his cour&s;e to Marybone, from whence pur&s;uing an ea&s;tern direction, he &s;kirted the town, and cro&s;&s;ed the I&s;lington road at the Angel. There was at the time no city-road, but pa&s;&s;ing through Hoxton, he got to Shoreditch, thence to Bethnal green, and from thence to Stepney, where he recruited his &s;pirits with a gla&s;s of brandy. From Stepney he pa&s;&s;ed on to Limehou&s;e, and took into his rout the adjacent hamlet of Poplar, when he be|came &s;en&s;ible that to complete his de&s;ign he mu&s;t take in South|wark: this put him to a &s;tand; but he &s;oon determined on his cour&s;e, for taking a boat he landed at the red hou&s;e at Deptford, and made his way to Say's court, where the great wet-dock is, and keeping the hou&s;es along Rotherhithe to the right, he got to Ber|mond&s;ey, thence by the &s;outh end of Kent-&s;treet to Newington, and over St. George's fields to Lambeth, and cro&s;&s;ing over to Mill|bank continued his way to Charing cro&s;s, and along the Strand to Norfolk &s;treet, from whence he had &s;et out. The whole of this excur&s;ion took him up from nine in the morning to three in the afternoon, and, according to his rate of walking, he computed the circuit of London at above twenty miles. With the buildings erected &s;ince, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have increa&s;ed five miles, and if &s;o, the pre&s;ent circumference of this great metropolis is about half that of ancient Rome.</NOTE>. He held a conver&s;ation on Sunday even|ings
<PB N="208" REF="211">
with his friends, who were men of the fir&s;t emi|nence for learning and intelligence, at his hou&s;e in Norfolk &s;treet in the Strand<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Formerly the habitation of the famous William Penn the quaker, of whom it is well known that his circum&s;tances at a certain period of his life were &s;o involved, that it was not &s;afe for him to go abroad. He cho&s;e this hou&s;e, it being at the &s;outh we&s;t corner of the &s;treet, as one from whence he might, upon occa&s;ion, &s;lip out by water. In the entrance to it he had a peeping-hole, through which he could &s;ee any per&s;ons that came to him. One of the&s;e who had &s;ent in his name, having been made to wait more than a rea&s;onable time, knocked for the &s;ervant, whom he a&s;ked, <Q REND="inline">'Will not thy ma&s;ter &s;ee me?' 'Friend,' an|&s;wered the &s;ervant, 'he has &s;een thee, but he does not like thee.'</Q> The fact was, that Penn had from his &s;tation taken a view of him, and found him to be a creditor.</NOTE>, in which all, particu|larly
<PB N="209" REF="212">
the library, was neat and elegant, without litter or di&s;order.</P>
<P>The mental endowments of Dr. Birch were &s;ingu|lar; he had a great eagerne&s;s after knowledge, and a memory very retentive of facts; but his learning, properly &s;o called, bore no proportion to his reading; for he was in truth neither a mathematician, a natural philo&s;opher, a cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, nor a divine; but, in a &s;mall degree, all, and though lively in conver&s;ation, he was but a dullwriter. John&s;on was u&s;ed to &s;peak of him in this manner: <Q REND="inline">'Tom is a lively rogue; he re|members a great deal, and can tell many plea&s;ant &s;tories; but a pen is to Tom a torpedo, the touch of it benumbs his hand and his brain: Tom can talk; but he is no writer.'&mdash;</Q>And indeed who|ever peru&s;es his writings will be much of the &s;ame opinion: his life of Tillot&s;on is a mere detail of un|connected facts, without the intermixture of &s;entiment or di&s;qui&s;ition; and of the &s;tyle, let this citation &s;erve as a &s;pecimen. Speaking of Wilkins, he makes a tran&s;ition to Tillot&s;on, whom he characterizes in the&s;e words, and meaner he could not have found: <Q REND="inline">'He went into all the very be&s;t things that were in that great man; but &s;o as he improved every one of them.'</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of all his labours and pur&s;uits, Dr. Birch pre&s;erved an even temper of mind, and a great chearfulne&s;s of &s;pirits. Ever de&s;irous to learn, and willing to communicate, he was uniformly affable, courteous, and di&s;po&s;ed to conver&s;ation. His life was &s;pent without reproach, but terminated by an unhappy accident, a fall from his hor&s;e on the Hamp|&s;tead road, on the 9th day of January, 1766. His
<PB N="210" REF="213">
preferments in the church, though &s;ucce&s;&s;ively nume|rous, were &s;mall and never reached to dignities: the la&s;t of them were the rectories of St. Margaret Pattens, London, and of Depden in E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>Dr. John Campbell was an eminent writer, and a labourer in a voluminous work undertaken at the expence and ri&s;que of the book&s;ellers, the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory. Be&s;ides many other books, he wrote the lives of the Engli&s;h admirals in four octavo volumes. He had a con&s;iderable hand in the Biographia Britan|nica, and was the author of a valuable work in two quarto volumes intitled, <Q REND="inline">'A political &s;urvey of Britain;'</Q> being a &s;eries of reflections on the &s;ituation, lands, inhabitants, revenues, colonies, and commerce of this i&s;land; intended to &s;hew that they have not as yet approached to near the &s;ummit of improvement, but that it will afford employment for many ages, before they pu&s;h to their utmo&s;t extent the natural advantages of Great Britain. The reputation of this work extended to the mo&s;t remote parts of Europe, and induced the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia in the year 1774, to honour the author with a pre&s;ent of her picture. By the exerci&s;e of his pen alone, and a good u&s;e of his time, he was for many years enabled to &s;upport him|&s;elf, and enjoy the comforts of dome&s;tic life in the &s;ociety of an excellent wife and a numerous offspring. In 1765, he was appointed his maje&s;ty's agent for the province of Georgia in North America, and was there|by rai&s;ed to a &s;tate of comparative affluence. His re|&s;idence for &s;ome years before his death, was the large new-built hou&s;e &s;ituate at the north-we&s;t corner of Queen &s;quare, Bloom&s;bury, whither, particularly on a Sunday evening, great numbers of per&s;ons of the
<PB N="211" REF="214">
fir&s;t eminence for &s;cience and literature were accu&s;-Tomed to re&s;ort for the enjoyment of conver&s;ation. He died in 1775, having nearly completed the &s;ixty|eighth year of his age, leaving behind him the charac|ter of a learned, an ingenious, and a pious man.</P>
<P>Dr. John Hill was originally an apothecary and a &s;tudent in botany, in which he was encouraged by the late duke of Richmond, and lord Petre; but finding that an unprofitable pur&s;uit, he made two or three attempts as a writer for the &s;tage: a failure in them drove him back to his former &s;tudy, in the cour&s;e whereof he got introduced to Mr. Martin Folkes and Mr. Henry Baker, leading members of the royal &s;ociety, who finding him a young man of parts and well &s;killed in natural hi&s;tory, recommended him among their friends. His fir&s;t publication was a tran&s;lation from the Greek of a &s;mall tract, Theo|phra&s;tus on gems, which being printed by &s;ub&s;crip|tion, produced him &s;ome money, and &s;uch a reputa|tion as induced the book&s;ellers to engage him in writ|ing a general natural hi&s;tory in two volumes in folio, and &s;oon after, a &s;upplement to Chambers's dictionary. He had received no academical education; but his ambition prompting him to be a graduate, he obtained, from one of tho&s;e univer&s;ities which would &s;carce re|fu&s;e a degree to an apothecary's hor&s;e, a diploma for that of doctor of phy&s;ic. After this, he engaged in a variety of works, the greater part whereof were mere compilations, which he &s;ent forth with incredible ex|pedition; and though his character was never in &s;uch e&s;timation with the book&s;ellers as to entitle him to an extraordinary price for his writings, he has been

He was vain, conceited, and in his writings di&s;po&s;ed to &s;atire and licentious &s;currility, which he indulged with|out any regard to truth, and thereby became engaged in frequent di&s;putes and quarrels that always termi|nated in his own di&s;grace. For &s;ome abu&s;e in his In&s;pec|tor, of a gentleman of the name of Brown, he had his head broke in the circus of Ranelagh gardens. He in&s;ulted Woodward the player in the face of an au|dience, and engaged with him in a pamphlet-war, in which he was foiled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was &s;aid of Hill, that when he met, in any botanic garden, with a curious plant that was portable, he would convey it away, and that he was once detected in an attempt of that kind. Woodward, in a pamphlet written again&s;t him, alluded to this fact by prefixing to it, as a motto, this appo&s;ite citation from Shake&s;peare's Romeo and Juliet:<Q><L>I do remember an apothecary</L>

In the mid&s;t of all this employ|ment, he found time and means to drive about the town in his chariot, and to appear abroad and at all public places, at Bat&s;on's coffee-hou&s;e, at ma&s;que|rades, and at the opera and playhou&s;es, &s;plendidly dre&s;&s;ed, and as often as he could, in the front row of

the boxes. Towards the end of his life, his reputa|tion as an author was &s;o &s;unk by the &s;lovenline&s;s of his compilations, and his di&s;regard to truth in what he related, that he was forced to betake him&s;elf to the vending a few &s;imple medicines, namely, e&s;&s;ence of water-dock, tincture of Valerian, bal&s;am of honey, and elixir of Bardana, and by pamphlets a&s;cribing to them greater virtues than they had, impo&s;ed on the credulity of the public, and thereby got, though not an hone&s;t, a competent livelihood.</P>
<P>Two years before his death, he had, as he gave out, received from the king of Sweden, the inve&s;titure of knight of one of the orders of that kingdom, in return for a pre&s;ent to that monarch of his <Q REND="inline">'Vegetable &s;y&s;tem'</Q> in twenty-&s;ix folio volumes. With all his folly and malignity, he entertained a &s;en&s;e of religion, and wrote a vindication of God and nature again&s;t the &s;hallow philo&s;ophy of lord Bolingbroke.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there was another cla&s;s of authors who lived by writing, that require to be noticed: the former were, in fact, pen&s;ioners of the book|&s;ellers: the&s;e vended their compo&s;itions when completed, to tho&s;e of that trade who would give mo&s;t for them. They were mo&s;tly books of mere entertainment that were the &s;ubjects of this kind of commerce, and were and &s;till are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the corrupt appellation of novels and roman|ces. Though fictitious, and the work of mere in|vention, they pretended to probability, to be found|ed in nature, and to delineate &s;ocial manners. The fir&s;t publication of the kind was the <Q REND="inline">'Pamela'</Q> of Mr.

Richard&s;on<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pamela is the name of a lady, one of the principal characters in Sir Philip Sidney's <Q REND="inline">'Arcadia,'</Q> and is thus accented Pame~la. So Mr. Pope,
<Q><L>The Gods, to cur&s;e Pame~la with her pray'rs,</L>
<L>Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares.</L></Q>
But Richard&s;on, whether through ignorance or de&s;ign, and al&s;o all his female pupils, con&s;tantly pronounced it Pame~la.</NOTE>, which being read with great eagerne&s;s by the young people of the time, and recommended from the pulpit, begat &s;uch a craving for more of the &s;ame &s;tuff, as tempted &s;ome men who&s;e nece&s;&s;i|ties and abilities were nearly commen&s;urate, to try their &s;ucce&s;s in this new kind of writing.</P>
<P>At the head of the&s;e we mu&s;t, for many rea&s;ons, place Henry Fielding, one of the mo&s;t motley of li|terary characters. This man was, in his early life, a writer of comedies and farces, very few of which are now remembered; after that, a practi&s;ing barri&s;ter with &s;carce any bu&s;ine&s;s; then an anti-mini&s;terial writer, and quickly after, a creature of the duke of Newca&s;tle, who gave him a nominal qualification of 100l. a year, and &s;et him up as a trading-ju&s;tice, in which di&s;reputable &s;tation he died. He was the au|thor of a romance, intitled <Q REND="inline">'The hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph Andrews,'</Q> and of another, <Q REND="inline">'The Foundling, or the hi&s;tory of Tom Jones,'</Q> a book &s;eemingly intended to &s;ap the foundation of that morality which it is the duty of parents and all public in&s;tructors to incul|cate in the minds of young people, by teaching that virtue upon principle is impo&s;ture, that generous qua|lities alone con&s;titute true worth, and that a young
<PB N="215" REF="220">
man may love and be loved, and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ociate with the loo&s;e&s;t women. His morality, in re&s;pect that it re&s;olves virtue into good affections, in contradiction to moral obligation and a &s;en&s;e of duty, is that of lord Shafte&s;bury vulgari&s;ed, and is a &s;y&s;tem of excellent u&s;e in palliating the vices mo&s;t injurious to &s;ociety. He was the inventor of that cant-phra&s;e, good|ne&s;s of heart, which is every day u&s;ed as a &s;ub&s;titute for probity, and means little more than the virtue of a hor&s;e or a dog; in &s;hort, he has done more towards corrupting the ri&s;ing generation than any writer we know of.</P>
<P>He afterwards wrote a book of the &s;ame kind, but of a le&s;s mi&s;chievous tendency, his <Q REND="inline">'Amelia.'</Q> For each of the&s;e he was well paid by Andrew Millar the book&s;eller, and for the la&s;t he got &s;ix hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Dr. Tobias Smollet, another writer of familiar romance, and a dealer with the book&s;ellers, was originally a &s;urgeon's mate, and &s;erved at the &s;iege of Carthagena. His fir&s;t publication of this kind was <Q REND="inline">'The adventures of Roderick Random,'</Q> and his next tho&s;e of Peregrine Pickle, in which is introduced the hi&s;tory of a well-known woman of quality, written, as it is &s;aid, by her&s;elf, under the name of lady Frail. The&s;e, and other compo&s;itions of the like kind, Smol|let &s;old to the book&s;ellers at &s;uch rates as enabled him to live without the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion. He had a hand in <Q REND="inline">'The univer&s;al hi&s;tory,'</Q> and tran&s;lated Gil Blas and al&s;o Telemachus. The &s;ucce&s;s of the former of the&s;e tempted him to tran&s;late <Q REND="inline">'Don Quixote,'</Q> which, as he under&s;tood not the Spani&s;h language, he could only do through the medium of the French and
<PB N="216" REF="221">
the former Engli&s;h ver&s;ions, none of which do, as it is &s;aid, convey the humour of the original. It might &s;eem that Jarvis's tran&s;lation was one impediment to &s;uch an undertaking; but that, though it gives the &s;en&s;e of the author, was performed by per&s;ons who&s;e &s;kill in the language was not great. The fact is, that Jarvis laboured at it many years, but could make but little progre&s;s, for being a painter by profe&s;&s;ion, he had not been accu&s;tomed to write, and had no &s;tyle. Mr. Ton&s;on the book&s;eller &s;eeing this, &s;ugge&s;ted the thought of employing Mr. Broughton, the reader at the Temple church, the author and editor of &s;undry publications, who, as I have been informed by a friend of Ton&s;on, &s;at him&s;elf down to &s;tudy the Spani&s;h language, and, in a few months, acquired, as was pre|tended, &s;ufficient knowledge thereof, to give to the world a tran&s;lation of Don Quixote in the true &s;pirit of the original, and to which is prefixed the name of Jarvis.</P>
<P>I might here &s;peak of Richard&s;on as a writer of fictitious hi&s;tory, but that he wrote for amu&s;ement, and that the profits of his writings, though very great, were accidental. He was a man of no learning nor reading, but had a vivid imagination, which he let loo&s;e in reflections on human life and manners, till it became &s;o di&s;tended with &s;entiments, that for his own ca&s;e, he was nece&s;&s;itated to vent them on paper. In the original plan of his <Q REND="inline">'Clari&s;&s;a,'</Q> it was his de&s;ign, as his book&s;eller once told me, to continue it to the extent of twenty-four volumes, but he was, with great difficulty, prevailed on to compri&s;e it in &s;ix. The character of Richard&s;on as a writer is to this day undecided, otherwi&s;e than by the avidity with which
<PB N="217" REF="222">
his publications are by &s;ome readers peru&s;ed, and the &s;ale of numerous editions. He has been celebrated as a writer &s;imilar in genius to Shake&s;peare, as being acquainted with the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the human heart, and having an ab&s;olute command of the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o as to be able to affect his readers as him&s;elf is affected, and to intere&s;t them in the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and di&s;appoint|ments, the joys and &s;orrows of his characters. Others there are who think that neither his <Q REND="inline">'Pamela,'</Q> his <Q REND="inline">'Cla|ri&s;&s;a,'</Q> nor his <Q REND="inline">'Sir Charles Grandi&s;on'</Q> are to be num|bered among the books of rational and in&s;tructive amu&s;ement, that they are not to be compared to the novels of Cervantes, or the more &s;imple and cha&s;te narrations of Le Sage, that they are not ju&s;t repre|&s;entations of human manners, that in them the turpi|tude of vice is not &s;trongly enough marked, and that the allurements to it are repre&s;ented in the gaye&s;t colours; that the texture of all his writings is flirn&s;y and thin, and his &s;tyle mean and feeble; that they have a general tendency to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of young people, and to teach them that which they need not to be taught; and that though they pretend to a moral, it often turns out a bad one. The cant terms of him and his admirers are &s;entiment and &s;enti|mentality.</P>
<P>John&s;on was inclined, as being per&s;onally acquaint|ed with Richard&s;on, to favour the former opinion of his writings, but he &s;eemed not firm in it, and could at any time be talked into a di&s;approbation of all fictitious relations, of which he would frequently &s;ay they took no hold of the mind.</P>
<P>I am tired of adducing in&s;tances of men who lived by the profe&s;&s;ion of writing and thought it
<PB N="218" REF="223">
an eligible one, and &s;hould now proceed to relate the &s;ub&s;equent events of Dr. John&s;on's life, and mark the &s;tate of his mind at different periods, but that I find my&s;elf detained by a character, which, as it were, obtrudes it&s;elf to view, and is of importance enough to claim notice.</P>
<P>Laurence Sterne, a clergyman and a dignitary of the cathedral church of York, was remarkable for a wild and eccentric genius, re&s;embling in many re|&s;pects that of Rabelais. The work that made him fir&s;t known as a writer, was, <Q REND="inline">'The life and opinions of Tri&s;tram Shandy,'</Q> a whim&s;ical rhap&s;ody, but abounding in wit and humour of the licentious kind. He too was a &s;entimentali&s;t, and wrote &s;entimental journies and &s;entimental letters in abundance, by which both he and the book&s;ellers got con&s;iderably. Of the writers of this cla&s;s or &s;ect it may be ob&s;erved, that being in general men of loo&s;e principles, bad oeconomi&s;ts, living without fore&s;ight, it is their en|deavour to commute for their failings by profe&s;&s;ions of greater love to mankind, more tender affections and finer feelings than they will allow men of more regular lives, whom they deem formali&s;ts, to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Their generous notions &s;uper&s;ede all obligation: they are a law to them&s;elves, and having good hearts and abounding in the milk of human kind|ne&s;s, are above tho&s;e con&s;iderations that bind men to that rule of conduct which is founded in a &s;en&s;e of duty. Of this new &s;chool of morality, Fielding, Rou&s;&s;eau, and Sterne are the principal teachers, and great is the mi&s;chief they have done by their documents.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224">
To the&s;e I might add the names of &s;undry per&s;ons of the &s;ame occupation, the authors of the Univer|&s;al hi&s;tory in forty folio volumes, but that only a few of them are at this di&s;tance of time known: tho&s;e are P&s;almanaazar, George Sale, the above Dr. Campbell, and Mr. George Shelvocke, who, of a boy bred to the &s;ea, became a man of learning, a travelling tutor, and at length attained to the lucra|tive employment of &s;ecretary of the po&s;t-office. Of the&s;e men it may be &s;aid that they were miners in literature, they worked, though not in darkne&s;s, under ground; their motive was gain; their labour &s;ilent and ince&s;&s;ant.</P>
<P>From the above enumeration of characters and particulars it may be inferred, that John&s;on's indo|lence and melancholy were di&s;ea&s;es of his mind, and not the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the profe&s;&s;ion he had taken up, that he &s;aw human life through a fal&s;e medium, and that he voluntarily renounced many comforts, gratifications, and even plea&s;ures, obviou&s;ly in his power. One effort however he made to &s;oothe his mind and palliate the fatigue of his labours, which I here relate.</P>
<P>The great delight of his life was conver&s;ation and mental intercour&s;e. That he might be able to in|dulge him&s;elf in this, he had, in the winter of 1749, formed a club that met weekly at the King's head, a famous beef-&s;teak hou&s;e, in Ivy lane near St. Paul's, every Tue&s;day evening. Thither he con&s;tantly re|&s;orted, and, with a di&s;po&s;ition to plea&s;e and be plea&s;ed, would pa&s;s tho&s;e hours in a free and unre&s;trained in|terchange of &s;entiments, which otherwi&s;e had been
<PB N="220" REF="225">
&s;pent at home in painful reflection. The per&s;ons who compo&s;ed this little &s;ociety were nine in num|ber: I will mention their names, and, as well as I am able, give a &s;light &s;ketch of the &s;everal characters of &s;uch of them as cannot now be affected by either prai&s;e or blame: they were, the reverend Dr. Salter, father of the late ma&s;ter of the Charterhou&s;e,&mdash;Dr. Hawke&s;|worth,&mdash;Mr. Ryland a merchant, a relation of his,&mdash;Mr. John Payne then a book&s;eller, but now or very lately chief accountant of the bank,&mdash;Mr. Samuel Dyer a learned young man intended for the di&s;&s;enting mi|ni&s;try,&mdash;Dr. William M'Ghie a Scots phy&s;ician,&mdash;Dr. Edmund Barker, a young phy&s;ician,&mdash;Dr. Richard Bathur&s;t al&s;o a young phy&s;ician, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. Samuel Salter was a Cambridge divine, whom &s;ome di&s;agreement between him and his children had driven from his abode at Norwich, at the age of &s;eventy, to &s;ettle in London. Being thus far ad|vanced in years, he could carry his recollection back to the time when Dr. Samuel Clarke was yet a mem|ber of that univer&s;ity, and would frequently entertain us with particulars re&s;pecting him. He was a digni|tary of the church, I think archdeacon of Norfolk, a man of general reading, but no deep &s;cholar: he was well-bred, courteous, and affable, and enlivened conver&s;ation by the relation of a variety of curious facts, of which his memory was the only regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>Dr. Hawke&s;worth is a character well known in the literary world: I &s;hall not attempt a delineation of it, as I find in the biographic dictionary an article for him in the words following:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'John Hawke&s;worth, an Engli&s;h writer of a very

&s;oft and plea&s;ing ca&s;t, was born about the year 1719, though his epitaph, as we find it in the Gentleman's Magazine," for Augu&s;t 1781, makes him to have been born in 1715. He was brought up to a mechanical profe&s;&s;ion, that of a watch|maker, as is &s;uppo&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a mi&s;take. He had been taught no art but that of writing, and was a hired clerk to one Harwood an attorney in Gro|cers' alley, in the Poultry.</NOTE>. He was of the &s;ect of pre&s;|byterians, and a member of the celebrated Tom Bradbury's meeting, from which he was expelled for &s;ome irregularities. He afterwards devoted him&s;elf to literature, and became an author of con|&s;iderable eminence. In the early part of his life, his circum&s;tances were rather confined. He re&s;ided &s;ome time at Bromley in Kent, where his wife kept a boarding-&s;chool. He afterwards became known to a lady, who had great property and intere&s;t in the Ea&s;t-India company; and, through her means, was cho&s;en a director of that body. As an author, his <Q REND="inline">'Adventurer'</Q> is his capital work; the merits of which, if we mi&s;take not, procured him the degree of L.L.D. from Herring, archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury. When the de&s;ign of compiling a narrative of the di&s;coveries in the South &s;eas was on foot, he was recommended as a proper per&s;on to be em|ployed on the occa&s;ion; but, in truth, he was not a proper per&s;on, nor did the performance an&s;wer ex|pectation. Works of ta&s;te and elegance, where ima|gination and the pa&s;&s;ions were to be affected, were his province; not works of dry, cold, accurate nar|rative. However, he executed his ta&s;k, and is &s;aid
<PB N="222" REF="227">
to have received for it the enormous &s;um of 60001. He died in 1773, &s;ome &s;ay of high living, others, of chagrin from the ill reception of his <Q REND="inline">'Narrative:'</Q> for he was a man of the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, and ob|noxious to all the evils of &s;uch irritable natures.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Samuel Dyer was the &s;on of a jeweller of emi|nence in the city, who, by his ingenuity and indu&s;try had acquired a competent fortune. He, as al&s;o his wife, were di&s;&s;enters, per&s;ons very religiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;|ed, members of Chandler's congregation in the Old Jewry, and this their younge&s;t &s;on was educated by pro|fe&s;&s;or Ward, at the time when he kept a private &s;chool in one of the alleys near Moorfields; and from thence, being intended by his father for the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;|try, was removed to Dr. Dodderidge's academy at Northampton. After having fini&s;hed his &s;tudies in this &s;eminary, he was removed to Gla&s;gow, where, un|der Dr. Hutche&s;on, he was in&s;tructed in the writings of the Greek morali&s;ts, and went through &s;everal cour&s;es of ethics and metaphy&s;ics. To complete this plan of a learned education, the elder Mr. Dyer, by the advice of Dr. Chandler, &s;ent his &s;on to Leyden, with a view to his improvement in the Hebrew literature under Schultens, a celebrated profe&s;&s;or in that univer&s;ity. After two years' &s;tay abroad, Mr. Dyer returned, eminently qualified for the exerci&s;e of that profe&s;&s;ion to which his &s;tudies had been directed, and great were the hopes of his friends that he would become one of its ornaments. To &s;peak of his attainments in knowledge, he was an excellent cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, a great mathematician and natural philo&s;opher, well ver&s;ed in the Hebrew, and
<PB N="223" REF="228">
ma&s;ter of the Latin, French and Italian languages. Added to the&s;e endowments, he was of a temper &s;o mild, and in his conver&s;ation and demeanour &s;o mo|de&s;t and una&s;&s;uming, that he engaged the attention and affection of all around him. In all que&s;tions of &s;cience, John&s;on looked up to him, and in his life of Watts, among the poets, has cited an ob&s;ervation of his, that Watts had <Q REND="inline">'confounded the idea of &s;pace with that of empty &s;pace, and did not con&s;ider that though &s;pace might be without matter, yet matter being extended, could not be without &s;pace.'</Q></P>
<P>It was now expected that Mr. Dyer would attach him&s;elf to the profe&s;&s;ion for which &s;o liberal and ex|pen&s;ive an education was intended to qualify him, and that he would, under all the di&s;couragements that at|tend non-conformity, appear as a public teacher, and by preaching give a &s;pecimen of his talents; and this was the more wi&s;hed, as he was a con&s;tant attendant on divine wor&s;hip, and the whole of his behaviour &s;uited to &s;uch a character. But being pre&s;&s;ed by my&s;elf and other of his friends, he di&s;covered an aver&s;ene&s;s to the undertaking, which we conceived to ari&s;e from mode&s;ty, but &s;ome time after found to have &s;prung from another cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;eeming &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, being ma&s;ter of his time, his friend Dr. Chandler found out for him an employment exactly &s;uitable to his talents. Dr. Da|niel Williams, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, who by marriage had become the owner of a very plentiful e&s;tate, and was the founder of the library for the u&s;e of tho&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion, in Redcro&s;s &s;treet, by his will had di|rected that certain controver&s;ial, and other religious
<PB N="224" REF="229">
tracts of his writing, &s;hould be tran&s;lated into Latin, and printed the &s;econd year after his death, and five hundred of each given away, and this beque&s;t to be re|peated when that number was di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>This part of his will had remained unexecuted from about the year 1715, and Dr. Chandler being a tru&s;tee for the performance of it, and empowered to offer an equivalent to any one that he &s;hould think equal to the undertaking, propo&s;ed it to Mr. Dyer, and he accepted it; but &s;mall was his progre&s;s in it before it began to grow irk&s;ome, and the completing of the tran&s;lation was referred to &s;ome one le&s;s aver&s;e to la|bour than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Having thus got rid of an employment to which no per&s;ua&s;ions of his friends nor pro&s;pects of future ad|vantage could reconcile him, he became, as it were, emancipated from the bondage of puritanical forms and modes of living. Mr. Dyer commenced a man of the world, and with a &s;ober and temperate deliberation re&s;olved on a participation of its plea&s;ures and enjoy|ments. His company, though he was rather a &s;ilent than a talkative man, was courted by many, and he had frequent invitations to dinners, to &s;uppers, and card-parties. By the&s;e means he became in&s;en&s;ibly a votary of plea&s;ure, and to ju&s;tify this choice, had rea|&s;oned him&s;elf into a per&s;ua&s;ion that, not only in the moral government of the world but in human man|ners, through all the changes and fluctuations of fa&s;hion and caprice, whatever is, is right. With this and other opinions equally tending to corrupt his mind, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that he began to grow indifferent to the &s;trict practice of religion, and
<PB N="225" REF="230">
the event &s;hewed it&s;elf in a gradual declination from the exerci&s;es of it, and his ea&s;y compliance with in|vitations to Sunday evening parties, in which mere conver&s;ation was not the chief amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>In his di&s;cour&s;e he was exceedingly clo&s;e and re|&s;erved: it was neverthele&s;s to be remarked of him, that he looked upon the re&s;traints on a life of plea&s;ure with an unapproving eye. He had an exqui&s;ite palate, and had improved his reli&s;h for meats and drinks up to &s;uch a degree of re&s;inement, that I once found him in a fit of melancholy occa&s;ioned by a di&s;covery that he had lo&s;t his ta&s;te for olives!</P>
<P>He was a man of deep reflection, and very able in con|ver&s;ation on mo&s;t topics; and after he had determined on his cour&s;e of life, which was, to be of no profe&s;&s;ion, but to become a gentleman at large, living much at the hou&s;es of his friends, he &s;eemed to adopt the &s;en|timents of a man of fa&s;hion. In a vi&s;it that he made with a friend to France, he met with a book with the title of <Q REND="inline">'Les Moeurs'</Q> with which he was greatly delight|ed, and at length became &s;o enamoured of it, and that free and liberal &s;pirit which it manife&s;ts, that, after a conflict with his natural indolence, in which he came off the victor, he formed a re&s;olution to tran&s;late it into Engli&s;h; but after a &s;mall progre&s;s in the work, the enemy rallied, and defeated him. Cave was his printer, and had worked off only a few &s;heets when Mr. Dyer's &s;tock of copy was exhau&s;ted, and his book&s;eller found him&s;elf reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of getting the tran&s;lation fini&s;hed by another hand, which he did, employing for the purpo&s;e a Mr. Collyer, the
<PB N="226" REF="231">
author of <Q REND="inline">'Letters from Felicia to Charlotte,'</Q> and other innocent and &s;ome u&s;eful publications. The tran&s;lation was completed, but upon its being &s;ent abroad, met with a rival one that involved Cave, who was intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of the book, in an adver|ti&s;ement-war, which he was left to conduct as he could.</P>
<P>Few who are acquainted with this book, will blame or wonder at Mr. Dyer's partiality for it. It is a work replete with good &s;en&s;e, &s;etting forth the excellence and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of moral virtue, in lan|guage &s;o elegant and lively, and with &s;uch forci|ble per&s;ua&s;ion, as cannot but win on a mind open to in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The earl of Che&s;terfield's voluminous exhortations to his &s;on have been, by &s;ome, e&s;teemed a &s;y&s;tem of education, a &s;y&s;tem which &s;inks into nothing when compared, either in its foundation or tendency, to that contained in this conci&s;e code of ethics. His lord&s;hip teaches the ba&s;er arts as means to that im|portant end, &s;ucce&s;s in the world; this writer, that the good opinion of mankind is never to be pur|cha&s;ed by deviating from the rule of right, and that we &s;eek in vain for happine&s;s, if we do not exert our&s;elves in the di&s;charge of our &s;everal duties. Principles &s;uch as the&s;e, the di&s;ciples of the Graces are not likely to reli&s;h; but it is neverthele&s;s true, that the una&s;&s;uming, the benevolent author of <Q REND="inline">'Les Moeurs'</Q> under&s;tood the art of forming the cha|racter of a really fine gentleman, much better than he who taught that infamy was the road to honour. In &s;hort, this is a work, in prai&s;e of which there is no danger of being too lavi&s;h, for tho&s;e mu&s;t be wi&s;e

indeed who are not informed by it, and incorrigible who&s;e tempers are not mended by it.</P>
<P>What then &s;hall we &s;ay of Mr. Dyer who could read it, approve it, and &s;o far &s;hake off his natural phlegm as to declare him&s;elf fa&s;cinated by, and actually begin a tran&s;lation of it, yet could abandon his work, and &s;ink into the very character again&s;t which it was an antidote, but that &s;loth had ob|tained the dominion over him, that a paraly&s;is had &s;eized his mental faculties, and that rejecting the prudent coun&s;els, the moral precepts, and the reli|gious in&s;truction contained in this elegant tract, he had given him&s;elf up to criminal indolence and &s;elf-gratification, and defeated the hopes of his be&s;t friends?</P>
<P>In the tran&s;lation into Engli&s;h, much of the &s;pirit of the original has evaporated; but it has merit, as &s;ome particulars which the different manners of the two nations made it fit to alter, are properly adapted in it to the genius of our country, and indeed the tran&s;la|tion, even if it had had le&s;s claim to our regard, mu&s;t have been acceptable, as it extended the benefits of this valuable tract.</P>
<P>Dyer's &s;upport, in the idle way of life which he had made choice of, was the produce of a patrimony in the funds, that could not be great; his father, from whom he derived it, having left, be&s;ides him&s;elf, a wi|dow, an elder &s;on and a daughter. John&s;on and my&s;elf, that he might be getting &s;omething, &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed him to write the life of Era&s;mus; but he could not be induced to undertake it. A work of le&s;s labour, but le&s;s worthy of him, he was however prevailed on
<PB N="228" REF="233">
by Mr. Samuel Sharp, the &s;urgeon, to engage in: this was a revi&s;ion of the old tran&s;lation of Plutarch's lives by &s;everal hands. He undertook, and, with heavy complaints of the labour of his ta&s;k, completed it, and had for his reward from Mr. Draper the part|ner of Mr. Ton&s;on, whom Mr. Sharp had &s;olicited to find &s;ome employment for him, the &s;um of two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>While he was a member of the club, John&s;on &s;u&s;|pected that his religious principles, for which at fir&s;t he honoured him, were giving way, and it was whi&s;pered to me by one who &s;eemed plea&s;ed that he was in the &s;ecret, that Mr. Dyer's religion was that of Socrates. What farther advances he made in Thei&s;m I could not learn, nor will I venture to a&s;&s;ert, that which &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions that I have heard drop from him led me to fear, viz. that he denied, in the philo|&s;ophical &s;en&s;e of the term, the freedom of the human will, and &s;ettled in materiali&s;m and its con&s;equent tenets.</P>
<P>As all his determinations were &s;low and deliberate, and &s;eemed to be the re&s;ult of rea&s;on and reflection, the change in his principles and conduct here noted was gradual. Of this the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms were an imbecillity to re&s;i&s;t any temptation abroad on a Sun|day evening, that &s;hould ea&s;e him of the trouble of &s;uch exerci&s;es as he had been accu&s;tomed to perform in the family of his mother, and an eager curio&s;ity in the peru&s;al of books not merely of entertainment, but of &s;uch, as together with a knowledge of the world, furni&s;hed his mind with &s;uch palliatives of vice as made him half a convert to it.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="234">
While his mind was in this &s;tate of trepidation, a young gentleman who had been a fellow-&s;tudent with him at Leyden, arrived in England, di&s;ordered in his health, of whom and who&s;e conver&s;ation he became &s;o enamoured, that to entertain him while he was &s;eek|ing the recovery of it, Dyer was almo&s;t lo&s;t to all the re&s;t of his friends. To tho&s;e with whom he was mo&s;t intimate, he would, notwith&s;tanding the clo&s;ene&s;s of his nature, de&s;cribe him and di&s;play his attractions, which as he repre&s;ented them, were learning, wit, po|litene&s;s, elegance, particularly in the article of dre&s;s; free and open manners, a genteel figure, and other per&s;onal charms that rendered him the delight of the female &s;ex. It was a que&s;tion that &s;ome of tho&s;e with whom he was thus open would frequently a&s;k him, <Q REND="inline">'What are the mo&s;t of the&s;e qualifications to you, Mr. Dyer, who are a man of a different character? you who know the value of wi&s;dom, and have a mind fraught with knowledge, which you are capable of applying to many beneficial purpo&s;es, can never be emulous of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which di&s;criminate a man of plea&s;ure from a philo&s;opher:'</Q> his an&s;wers to which &s;erved only to &s;hew that his judgment was corrupted: The habitation of his friend, whom he thus vi&s;ited, was a brothel, and his di&s;ea&s;e &s;uch as tho&s;e &s;eldom e&s;cape who frequent hou&s;es of lewd re&s;ort. The &s;olicitude which the females in that place &s;hewed for the recovery of his friend, their clo&s;e attendance on him, and a&s;&s;iduity in admini&s;tering to him his medicines, and &s;upplying all his wants, he attributed to genuine love; and &s;eemed almo&s;t to envy in him that power which could intere&s;t &s;o many

young per&s;ons of the other &s;ex in the re&s;toration of his health.</P>
<P>What effect the&s;e vi&s;its, and the blandi&s;hments to which, as often as he made them, he was a witne&s;s, had upon Dyer, I know not, &s;ave that to defeat the enchantments of the&s;e &s;yrens he practi&s;ed none of the arts of Uly&s;&s;es: on the contrary, they &s;eemed to have wrought in him an opinion, that tho&s;e mi&s;took their intere&s;t, and &s;hewed their ignorance of human life, who ab&s;tained from any plea&s;ure that di&s;turbed not the quiet of families or the order of &s;ociety; that natural appetites required gratification, and were not to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without it; that the indulgence of the ira&s;|cible pa&s;&s;ions alone was vice; and that to live in peace with all mankind, and in a temper to do good offices, was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of our duty.</P>
<P>Having admitted the&s;e principles into his mind, he &s;ettled into a &s;ober &s;en&s;uali&s;t; in a perfect con&s;i&s;tency with which character, he was content to eat the bread of idlene&s;s, laying him&s;elf open to the invitations of tho&s;e that kept the be&s;t tables, and contracting intimacies with men not only of oppo&s;ite parties, but with &s;ome who &s;eemed to have abandoned all prin|ciple, whether religious, political or moral. The hou&s;es of many &s;uch in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion were his home; and for the gratifications of a well-&s;pread table, choice wines, variety of company, card-parties, and a par|ticipation in all dome&s;tic amu&s;ements and recreations, the owners thought them&s;elves recompen&s;ed by his conver&s;ation and the readine&s;s with which he accom|modated him&s;elf to all about him. Nor was he ever at a lo&s;s for rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify this abu&s;e of his parts or
<PB N="231" REF="236">
wa&s;te of his time: he looked upon the practice of the world as the rule of life, and thought it did not be|come an individual to re&s;i&s;t it.</P>
<P>By the death of his mother, his brother and &s;i&s;ter, all of whom he &s;urvived, he became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about 8000l. in the funds, which, as he was an oeconomi&s;t and inclined to no extravagance, it &s;eemed highly improbable he would ever be tempted to di&s;&s;i|pate; but he had contracted a fatal intimacy with &s;ome per&s;ons of de&s;perate fortunes, who were dealers in India &s;tock, at a time when the affairs of the com|pany were in a &s;tate of fluctuation; and though, from his indolent and ab&s;tracted temper of mind and ignorance of bu&s;ine&s;s, the la&s;t man to be &s;u&s;pected of yielding to &s;uch delu&s;ions, he fir&s;t inve&s;ted all he had in that precarious fund, and next became a candidate for the office of a director of the company, but failed in his attempt. After this, he entered into engage|ments for the purcha&s;e or &s;ale of &s;tock, and by violat|ing them, made &s;hipwreck of his honour. La&s;tly, he made other contracts of the like kind, to the per|formance whereof he was &s;trictly bound: the&s;e turned out again&s;t him, and &s;wallowed the whole of his fortune. About the time of this event he was &s;eized with a quin&s;ey, which he was a&s;&s;ured was mortal; but whether he re&s;igned him&s;elf to the &s;low operation of that di&s;ea&s;e, or precipitated his end by an act of &s;elf-violence, was, and yet is, a que&s;tion among his friends. He left not in money or effects &s;ufficient to defray the expence of a decent funeral, and the la&s;t office of humanity towards him was performed by one of tho&s;e who had been acce&s;&s;ary to his ruin. A por|trait
<PB N="232" REF="237">
of him was painted by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, and from it a mezzotinto was &s;craped, the print whereof, as he was little known, &s;old only to his friends; a &s;ingular u&s;e however was made of it: Bell, the pub|li&s;her of the Engli&s;h poets, cau&s;ed an engraving to be made from it, and prefixed it to the poems of Mr. John Dyer.</P>
<P>I have been thus particular in the hi&s;tory of this accompli&s;hed and hopeful young man, whom I once loved with the affection of a brother, with a view to &s;hew the tendency of idlene&s;s, and to point out at what avenues vice may gain admittance in minds &s;eemingly the mo&s;t &s;trongly fortified. The a&s;&s;ailable part of his was laxity of principle: at this entered infidelity, which was followed by &s;uch temptations to plea&s;ure as he could &s;ee no rea&s;on to re&s;i&s;t: the&s;e led on de&s;ires after the means of gratification, and the pur&s;uit of them was his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>M^cGhie was a Scotchman by birth, and educated, in one of the univer&s;ities of that country, for the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic. In the rebellion in 1745, he, with a party of young men who, as volunteers, had a&s;&s;oci|ated on the &s;ide of government, bore arms, and was engaged in the &s;kirmi&s;h at Falkirk, which he ever &s;poke of as an ill-conducted bu&s;ine&s;s. When mat|ters were become pretty quiet in Scotland, he took a doctor's degree, and came to London, where, tru&s;ting to the friend&s;hip of his countrymen he hoped to &s;ucceed in practice, but the town was over&s;tocked with Scotch phy&s;icians, and he met with &s;mall en|couragement, though, by the favour of Dr. Benja|min Avery, the trea&s;urer of Guy's ho&s;pital, who had
<PB N="233" REF="238">
been a di&s;&s;enting teacher, and at that time was at the head of that intere&s;t, he got to be elected one of the phy&s;icians of that charity. He was a learned, ingenious, and mode&s;t man; and one of tho&s;e few of his country whom John&s;on could endure. To &s;ay the truth, he treated him with great civility, and may almo&s;t be &s;aid to have loved him. He inherited a patrimony too &s;mall for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and failing in his hope of getting forward in his profe&s;&s;ion, died of a broken heart, and was buried by a contribution of his friends.</P>
<P>Barker, being by education a di&s;&s;enter, was &s;ent to &s;tudy phy&s;ic at Leyden, from whence he returned about the time I am &s;peaking of. He was introduced to us by Dyer, and had been a fellow-&s;tudent with him and with Aken&s;ide, A&s;kew, Munckley, Mr. Dy&s;on of the hou&s;e of commons, and others, few of whom are now living. From the conver&s;ation of the&s;e per&s;ons, he learned the principles of lord Shafte&s;|bury's philo&s;ophy, and became, as mo&s;t of them were, a favourer of his notions, and an acute rea&s;oner on the &s;ubject of ethics. He was an excellent cla&s;&s;ical &s;cho|lar, a deep metaphy&s;ician, and had enriched his fancy by reading the Italian poets; but he was a thoughtle&s;s young man, and in all his habits of dre&s;s and ap|pearance &s;o &s;lovenly as made him the je&s;t of all his companions. Phy&s;icians in his time were u&s;ed to be full dre&s;&s;ed; and in his garb of a full &s;uit, a brown tye-wig with a knot over one &s;houlder, and a long yellow-hilted &s;word, and his hat under his arm, he was a caricature. In his religious principles he pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an unitarian, for which John&s;on &s;o often
<PB N="234" REF="239">
&s;nubbed him, that his vi&s;its to us became le&s;s and le&s;s frequent. After &s;uch a de&s;cription as that above, it is needle&s;s to add that Barker &s;ucceeded ill in his profe&s;&s;ion. Upon his leaving us, he went to practi&s;e at Trowbridge in Wilt&s;hire, but at the end of two years returned to London, and became librarian to the col|lege of phy&s;icians, in the room of Edwards the orni|thologi&s;t; but for &s;ome mi&s;behaviour was di&s;placed, and died in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Dr. Richard Bathur&s;t was a native of Jamaica, and the &s;on of an eminent planter in that i&s;land, who coming to &s;ettle in England, placed his &s;on in London, in order to qualify him for the practice of phy&s;ic. In the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies he became acquainted with John&s;on, and was greatly beloved by him for the preg|nancy of his parts and the elegance of his manners. Be|&s;ides the&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the qualities that were mo&s;t like|ly to recommend him in his profe&s;&s;ion; but, want|ing friends, could make no way in it. He had ju&s;t intere&s;t enough to be cho&s;en phy&s;ician to an ho&s;pital that was &s;upported by precarious donations, and which yielded him little or no recompence for his attendance, which, as it was only a few hours on cer|tain days in the week, left him, in a great mea&s;ure, ma&s;ter of his time. Of this he was a good manager, employing it in the &s;tudies relative to his profe&s;&s;ion, and the improvement of him&s;elf in polite literature. In conjunction with John&s;on, Hawke&s;worth, and others, he wrote <Q REND="inline">'the Adventurer,'</Q> a periodical paper that will hereafter be &s;poken of, pur&s;uing at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t prudent and probable methods for ac|quiring reputation and advancing him&s;elf in his pro|fe&s;&s;ion; but mi&s;&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s, he embraced the
<PB N="235" REF="240">
offer of an appointment of phy&s;ician to the army that was &s;ent on the expedition again&s;t the Havannah, where, &s;oon after his arrival, he was &s;eized with a fever that then raged among the troops, and which, before he could be a witne&s;s of the reduction of the place, put a period to an innocent and u&s;eful life.</P>
<P>The Spaniards have a proverb, that he who intends to be pope mu&s;t think of nothing el&s;e. Bathur&s;t thought of becoming an eminent London phy&s;ician, and omitted no means to attain that character: he &s;tudied hard, dre&s;&s;ed well, and a&s;&s;ociated with tho&s;e who were likely to bring him forward, but he failed in his endea|vours, and &s;hortly before his leaving England confe&s;&s;ed to John&s;on, that in the cour&s;e of ten years' exerci&s;e of his faculty, he had never opened his hand to more than one guinea.</P>
<P>The failure of three &s;uch per&s;ons as tho&s;e above|mentioned, in a profe&s;&s;ion in which very many igno|rant men have been known to &s;ucceed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So ignorant as to reque&s;t of the college the indulgence of an examination in Engli&s;h.</NOTE>, was matter of wonder to John&s;on and all that knew them. He obeyed that precept of Scripture, which exhorts us to honour the phy&s;ician, and would frequently &s;ay of tho&s;e of this country, that they did more good to mankind, without a pro&s;pect of reward, than any pro|fe&s;&s;ion of men whatever. Bathur&s;t's want of encourage|ment affected him much: he often expre&s;&s;ed to me his &s;urprize, that a young man of his endowments and engaging manners, &s;hould &s;ucceed no better, and his di&s;appointment drew from him a reflection, which he has in&s;erted in his life of Aken&s;ide, that by an acute ob&s;erver who had looked on the tran&s;actions of the
<PB N="236" REF="241">
medical world for half a century, a very curious book might be written on the fortune of phy&s;icians. Such a book I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee; and if any per&s;on hereafter &s;hall be induced to pur&s;ue John&s;on's hint, he may po&s;&s;ibly think the following remarks which have occurred to me in the cour&s;e of a long intimacy with &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent of the profe&s;&s;ion, not altogether beneath his notice.</P>
<P>Of the profe&s;&s;ors of medicine, in cities remote from London and in country rowns, I know but little; but in the metropolis I am able to &s;ay, that in my time not only the track of a young phy&s;ician was pretty plainly pointed out, and it is curious to follow it, but that the conduct of &s;uch an one was reducible to a &s;y&s;tem. Mead was the &s;on of a non-conforming mini&s;ter the teacher of a numerous congregation, who tru&s;ting to his influence over them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The intere&s;t which the di&s;&s;enting teachers had with the members of their &s;everal congregations, though now but little known, was formerly very great, and in my memory was &s;uch, that &s;carcely any member of a &s;eparate congregation would di&s;po&s;e of a daughter, or make a purcha&s;e, or advance a &s;um of money on a mortgage, without fir&s;t con&s;ulting his pa&s;tor.</NOTE>, bred his &s;on a phy&s;ician, with what &s;ucce&s;s is well known<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have heard it &s;aid, that when Mead began to practi&s;e, he was a con&s;tant frequenter of the meeting at Stepney, where his father preached; and that when he was &s;ent for out of the a&s;&s;embly, which he often was, his father would in his prayer in&s;ert a petition in behalf of the &s;ick per&s;on. I once mentioned this to John&s;on, who &s;aid it was too gro&s;s for belief; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> was not &s;o at Bat&s;on's: it pa&s;&s;ed there as a current tradition.</NOTE>. He rai&s;ed the medical character to &s;uch a height of dignity as was never &s;een in this or any other country. His example was an inducement with others of the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters to make phy|&s;icians
<PB N="237" REF="242">
of their &s;ons. Oldfield, Clark, Ne&s;bit, Lobb, and Munckley were the &s;ons of di&s;&s;enting teachers, and they generally &s;ucceeded. The ho&s;pital of St. Thomas, and that of Guy, in Southwark, were both under the government of di&s;&s;enters and whigs; and as &s;oon as any one became phy&s;ician of either, his fortune was looked upon as made. The mention of this circum&s;tance brings to my remembrance a conte&s;t, that, to a degree, proves the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion. Dr. a&s;terwards Sir Edward, Hul&s;e had been &s;ome years phy&s;ician to St. Thomas's ho&s;pital, and being minded to re&s;ign, had &s;et his eye upon Dr. Jo&s;eph Letherland, a man of profound erudition, for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Hoadly, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, had about that time a &s;on, who having fini&s;hed his &s;tudies in phy&s;ic at Cambridge, had taken his doctor's de|gree, and was about to &s;ettle in London. Hoadly was ever the idol of the whigs: he encouraged his &s;on to offer him&s;elf, and the intere&s;t was divided. Every nerve was &s;trained, and Hoadly mi&s;&s;ed his elec|tion by fewer than ten votes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is remarkable of this per&s;on, that upon this failure he aban|doned his profe&s;&s;ion; not &s;o much perhaps becau&s;e of his di&s;appoint|ment, as of his principles. To a friend of mine he confe&s;&s;ed that he was, as to the effects of medicine, a &s;ceptic; for that upon the principles of philo&s;ophy, he could not account for the operation of any one medicine on the human body. He &s;eemed in this in&s;tance to have adopted the &s;entiments of Montaigne, who entertained the &s;ame doubt, and, &s;omewhere in his e&s;&s;ays, de&s;cribes a phy&s;ician putting a pill into a patient's mouth, with a commi&s;&s;ion to follow the circulation, and act only on that part, the toe for in&s;tance, to which it is directed. Of a different opinion was the father of the per&s;on above-mentioned, Hoadly, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, when, writing again&s;t the free-thinkers, he put this &s;hrewd que&s;|tion: <Q REND="inline">'Were all the mi&s;takes and errors of phy&s;icians, from the beginning of the world to this day, collected into a volume, would they afford a good rea&s;on again&s;t taking phy&s;ic?'</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>

The &s;ame advantage attended the election of a phy&s;ician to the ho&s;pitals of Bethlehem and St. Bartholomew, which are of royal foundation, and have been under tory government.

<P>Jurin, Shaw, James, and &s;ome few others, recom|mended them&s;elves to practice by their writings, but in general the methods of acquiring it; I &s;peak of the city, were &s;uch as are above de&s;cribed. One and only one of the profe&s;&s;ion I am able to name who pur&s;ued a different conduct, and under the greate&s;t di&s;advan|tages &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>This per&s;on was Dr. Meyer Schomberg, a native of Cologne, who being a jew, and as I have heard related of him, librarian to &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction abroad,
<PB N="240" REF="245">
left that occupation, and came and &s;ettled in London. Being of no profe&s;&s;ion, and having the means of a livelihood to &s;eek, he was at a pau&s;e, but at length determined on one, and took it up in a manner that will be be&s;t de&s;cribed by his own words to a friend of mine. <Q REND="inline">'I &s;aid I was a phy&s;ician.'</Q> Having thus a&s;&s;um|ed a profe&s;&s;ion, he cultivated an intimacy with the jews in Duke's place, and by their means got intro|duced to the acquaintance of &s;ome of the leading men, merchants and others of that religion, who employed him, and by their intere&s;t recommended him to a practice that, in a few years amounted, as he once told me him&s;elf, to a thou&s;and pounds a year. He was a man of an in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and as he under|&s;tood mankind very well, having renounced the ritual di&s;tinctions of his religion, he &s;oon found out a me|thod of acquiring popularity, which had never been practi&s;ed by any of his profe&s;&s;ion; he took a large hou&s;e in the city, and kept a public table, to which, on a certain day in the week, all the young &s;urgeons and apothecaries were welcome, and at which all that were pre&s;ent were treated with an indi&s;criminate civility, that had very much the appearance of friend|&s;hip, but meant nothing more than that they &s;hould recommend him to practice. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded; in the year 1740, Schomberg had out&s;tripped all the city-phy&s;icians, and was in the annual receipt of four thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>To enable him to practice, he had, at his &s;etting out, procured to be admitted a licentiate of the college, but that permi&s;&s;ion had been granted him with &s;o ill a grace, or was followed by &s;ome circum&s;tances that
<PB N="241" REF="246">
provoked his re&s;entment &s;o highly, that he &s;eemed re|&s;olved on a perpetual enmity again&s;t the members of that body; who, on their part, looking on him as little better than a foreign mountebank, declined, as much as po&s;&s;ible, meeting him in con&s;ultation, and thereby, for &s;ome time, checked his practice.</P>
<P>He had a &s;on whom he brought up to his own pro|fe&s;&s;ion, who took it into his head, that having been admitted a licentiate, he was virtually a fellow, and claimed to be admitted as &s;uch: his father encou|raged him, and in&s;tituted a proce&s;s in his behalf, of which there had been no precedent &s;ince the time that Jefferies was chancellor. It was no le&s;s than a petition to the king, reque&s;ting him, in the per&s;on of the lord-chancellor, to exerci&s;e his vi&s;itatorial power over the college, and re&s;tore the licentiates to their rights, which, by their arbitrary proceedings, the pre&s;ident and fellows had, for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, deprived them of. This petition came on to be heard at Lincoln's-inn hall, before the lord chief ju&s;tice Willes, the lord chief-baron Smythe, and Sir John Eardley Wilmot, lords commi&s;&s;ioners of the great &s;eal, but the allegations therein contained not being &s;ufficiently &s;upported, the &s;ame was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; it was neverthele&s;s looked on as the mo&s;t &s;ormidable attack on the college it had ever &s;u&s;tained, and may be &s;aid to have &s;haken its con&s;titution to the very centre.</P>

body of men, had power and intere&s;t &s;ufficient to introduce into great practice one of their own deno|mination; this was John Fothergill, a young man of parts and indu&s;try, who being bred an apothecary, and having obtained a Scotch degree, &s;ettled in London, and attached him&s;elf to Schomberg, taking him, in many parts of his conduct, for his exemplar: &s;o that, upon Schomberg's decea&s;e, he &s;lid into his practice, and became one of the mo&s;t popular of the city phy&s;icians. The&s;e two per&s;ons, fir&s;t one, and then the other, for full thirty years, carried all before them; and within that &s;pace of time, not fewer than twenty of the profe&s;&s;ion, whom I could name, lived in great &s;traits, &s;ome of them leaving, at their decea&s;e, &s;carce &s;ufficient to bury them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e, and many other in&s;tances that might be produced, it is evident, that neither learning, parts, nor &s;kill, nor even all the&s;e united, are &s;ufficient to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s in the profe&s;&s;ion I am &s;peaking of; and that, without the concurrence of adventitious circum&s;tances, which no one can pretend to define, a phy&s;ician of the greate&s;t merit may be lo&s;t to the world; and further it may be &s;aid, that the faire&s;t hopes may be fru&s;trated by the want of that qua|lity, which Swift &s;omewhere calls an aldermanly virtue, di&s;cretion, but is in truth, of greater effi|cacy in our intercour&s;e with mankind, than all &s;cience put together. Had Aken&s;ide been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this gift, he had probably become the fir&s;t in his faculty; but that he was able to acquire no other kind of celebrity than that of a &s;cholar and a poet, is to be accounted for by &s;ome particulars in his life and conduct, with which few but my&s;elf, who
<PB N="243" REF="248">
knew him well, are acquainted, and which I here in|&s;ert as &s;uppletory to tho&s;e which John&s;on has recorded of him. Mr. Dy&s;on and he were fellow &s;tudents, the one of law and the other of phy&s;ic, at Leyden; where, being of congenial tempers, a friend&s;hip com|menced between them that la&s;ted through their lives. They left the univer&s;ity at the &s;ame time, and both &s;ettled in London: Mr. Dy&s;on took to the bar, and being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a hand&s;ome fortune &s;upported his friend while he was endeavouring to make him|&s;elf known as a phy&s;ician; but in a &s;hort time, hav|ing purcha&s;ed of Mr. Hardinge, his place of clerk of the hou&s;e of commons, he quitted We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, and for the purpo&s;e of introducing Aken&s;ide to acquaintance in an opulent neighbourhood near the town, bought a hou&s;e at North-End, Hamp&s;tead; where they dwelt together during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on: frequenting the long room, and all clubs, and a&s;&s;em|blies of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>At the&s;e meetings, which as they were not &s;elect, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch per&s;ons as u&s;ually meet for the purpo&s;e of go&s;&s;iping, men of wealth, but of ordinary endowments, and able to talk of little el&s;e than news, and the occurrences of the day, Aken&s;ide was for di&s;playing tho&s;e talents which had acquired him the reputation he enjoyed in other companies; but here they were of little u&s;e to him, on the contrary, they tended to engage him in di&s;putes that betrayed him into a contempt of tho&s;e that differed in opinion from him. It was found out that he was a man of low birth, and a dependant on Mr. Dy&s;on; circum&s;tances that fur|ni&s;hed tho&s;e whom he offended with a ground of re|proach,
<PB N="244" REF="249">
that reduced him to the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;ert|ing in terms that he was a gentleman.</P>
<P>Little could be done at Hamp&s;tead after matters had proceeded to this extremity; Mr. Dy&s;on parted with his villa at North-End, and &s;ettled his friend in a &s;mall hou&s;e in Bloom&s;bury &s;quare; a&s;&s;igning for his &s;upport &s;uch a part of his income as enabled him to keep a chariot.</P>
<P>In this new &s;ituation Aken&s;ide u&s;ed every endea|vour to become popular, but defeated them all by the high opinion he every where manife&s;ted of him&s;elf, and the little conde&s;cen&s;ion he &s;hewed to men of inferior endowments; by his love of political controver&s;y, his authoritative cen&s;ure of the public councils, and his bigotted notions re&s;pecting government, &s;ubjects &s;o|reign to his profe&s;&s;ion, and with which &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t of it have thought it prudent not to concern them&s;elves. In the winter evenings he frequented Tom's coffee-hou&s;e in Devereux court, then the re&s;ort of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent men for learning and ingenuity of the time, with &s;ome of whom he be|came entangled in di&s;putes and altercations, chiefly on &s;ubjects of literature and politics, that fixed on his character the &s;tamp of haughtine&s;s and &s;elf-conceit, and drew him into di&s;agreeable &s;ituations.</P>
<P>There was at that time a man of the name of Ballow, who u&s;ed to pa&s;s his evenings in the &s;ociety above|mentioned, a lawyer by profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was the author of a treati&s;e on equity, in folio, publi&s;hed without a name.</NOTE>, but of no practice; he having, by the intere&s;t of &s;ome of the Town&s;hends, to whom he had been a kind of law tutor, obtained a place in the exchequer, which yielded him a hand&s;ome
<PB N="245" REF="250">
income, and exempted him from the nece&s;&s;ity of attending We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. He was a man of deep and exten&s;ive learning, but of vulgar manners; and being of a &s;plenetic temper, envied Aken&s;ide for that eloquence which he di&s;played in his conver&s;ation, and &s;et his own phra&s;eology very low. Moreover he hated him for his republican principles; and finally, being him&s;elf a man of &s;olid learning, affected to treat him as a pretender to literature, and made it his &s;tudy to provoke him.</P>
<P>One evening at the coffee-hou&s;e a di&s;pute between the&s;e two per&s;ons ro&s;e &s;o high, that for &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ion uttered by Ballow, Aken&s;ide thought him|&s;elf obliged to demand an apology, which not being able to obtain, he &s;ent his adver&s;ary a challenge in writing. Ballow, a little deformed man, well known as a &s;aunterer in the park, about We&s;tmin&s;ter, and in the &s;treets between Charing cro&s;s and the hou&s;es of parliament, though remarkable for a &s;word of an unu&s;ual length, which he con&s;tantly wore when he went abroad, had no inclination for fighting, and declined an an&s;wer. The demand of &s;atisfaction was followed by &s;everal attempts on the part of Aken&s;ide to &s;ee Ballow at his lodgings, but he kept clo&s;e, till by the interpo&s;ition of friends the difference could be adju&s;ted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This method of re&s;enting affronts offered to phy&s;icians is not new. The grave and placid Dr. Mead was once provoked to it by Dr. Woodward of Gre&s;ham college, who, in the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion, had &s;aid or done &s;omething to offend him: he went to Woodward's lodgings to demand &s;atisfaction, and meeting him under the arch in the way from the outer court to the greencourt, drew his &s;word and bid him defend him&s;elf or beg pardon, which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, he did. This rencounter is recorded in an engraved view of Gre&s;ham college, in&s;erted in Dr. Ward's lives of the Gre&s;ham profe&s;&s;ors, in which Woodward is repre|&s;ented kneeling, and laying his &s;word at the feet of his anta|goni&s;t; and was thus explained to me by Dr. Lawrence the phy|&s;ician. Mead was the friend and patron of Ward, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been his inducement to perpetuate an event &s;o foreign to the nature of his work.</NOTE>. By his conduct in this bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="246" REF="251">
Aken&s;ide acquired but little reputation for courage, for the accommodation was not brought about by any conce&s;&s;ions of his adver&s;ary, but by a re&s;olution from which neither of them would depart, for one would not fight in the morning, nor the other in the after|noon: all that he got by it was, the character of an ira&s;cible man; and many who admired him for his genius and parts were &s;hy of becoming his inti|mates. Yet where there was no competition for applau&s;e or literary reputation, he was an ea&s;y compa|nion, and would bear with &s;uch rudene&s;s as would have angered almo&s;t any one. Saxby, of the cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, who was every evening at Tom's, and by the bluntne&s;s of his behaviour, and the many &s;hrewd &s;ayings he was u&s;ed to utter, had acquired the privi|lege of Ther&s;ites, of &s;aying whatever he would, was once in my hearing, inveighing again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic, which Aken&s;ide took upon him to de|fend. This railer, after labouring to prove that it was all impo&s;ture, concluded his di&s;cour&s;e with this &s;entiment: <Q REND="inline">'Doctor,' &s;aid he, 'after all you have &s;aid, my opinion of the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic is this, The ancients endeavoured to make it a &s;cience and failed; and the moderns to make it a trade and have &s;uc|ceeded.'</Q>
<PB N="247" REF="252">
Aken&s;ide took this &s;arca&s;m in good part, and joined in the laugh which it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>The value of that precept which exhorts us to live peaceably with all men, or in other words to avoid creating enemies, can only be e&s;timated by the reflec|tion on tho&s;e many amiable qualities again&s;t which the neglect of it will preponderate. Aken&s;ide was a man of religion and &s;trict virtue, a philo&s;opher, a &s;cholar, and a fine poet. His conver&s;ation was of the mo&s;t delightful kind, learned, in&s;tructive, and without any affectation of wit, chearful and entertaining. One of the plea&s;ante&s;t days of my life I pa&s;&s;ed with him, Mr. Dy&s;on, and another friend, at Putney bowling-green hou&s;e, where a neat and elegant dinner, the enlivening &s;un&s;hine of a &s;ummer's day, and the view of an un|clouded &s;ky, were the lea&s;t of our gratifications. In perfect good humour with him&s;elf and all around him, he &s;eemed to feel a joy that he lived, and poured out his gratulations to the great di&s;pen&s;er of all felicity in expre&s;&s;ions that Plato him&s;elf might have uttered on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. In conver&s;ations with &s;elect friends, and tho&s;e who&s;e cour&s;e of &s;tudy had been nearly the &s;ame with his own, it was an u&s;ual thing with him in libations to the memory of eminent men among the ancients, to bring their characters into view, and there|by give occa&s;ion to expatiate on tho&s;e particulars of their lives that had rendered them famous: his method was to arrange them into three cla&s;&s;es, philo&s;ophers, poets, and legi&s;lators.</P>
<P>That a character thus formed &s;hould fail of recom|mending it&s;elf to general e&s;teem, and procure to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it tho&s;e benefits which it is in the power of
<PB N="248" REF="253">
mankind to be&s;tow, may &s;eem a wonder, but it is often &s;een, that negative qualities are more conducive to this end than po&s;itive; and that, with no higher a character than is attainable by any one who with a &s;tudious taciturnity will keep his opinions to him&s;elf, conform to the practice of others, and entertain neither friend&s;hip for nor enmity again&s;t any one, a competitor for the good opinion of the world, nay for emoluments, and even dignities, &s;tands a better chance of &s;ucce&s;s, than one of the mo&s;t e&s;tab|li&s;hed reputation for learning and ingenuity. The truth of this ob&s;ervation Aken&s;ide him&s;elf lived to experience, who in a competition for the place of phy|&s;ician to the Charterhou&s;e, was unable to prevail again&s;t an ob&s;cure man, devoid of every quality that might &s;erve to recommend him, and who&s;e &s;ole merit was that of being di&s;tantly related to the late lord Holland.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been di&s;appointed in their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the medical profe&s;&s;ion, may be added one, to whom his failure was &s;o far from being a misfortune, that it was the means of placing him in a &s;tation where only his worth could be known, and of exalting him to dignities in which he rendered more &s;ervice to mankind, than he could have done in any other capacity whatever. This was Dr. Secker, the late archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; of whom I &s;hall relate a few particulars not generally known.</P>
<P>We are told by the reverend authors of his life, prefixed to his &s;ermons publi&s;hed by them, that he had been de&s;tined by his father for orders among the di&s;&s;enters; but that not being able to decide on
<PB N="249" REF="254">
&s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e &s;peculative doctrines, nor to determine ab&s;olutely what communion he &s;hould embrace, he ap|plied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic. To this fact I add, that he was al&s;o a candidate for practice, and that in or|der to obtain it, he put on the garb of a phy&s;ician; and for a year or &s;omewhat more frequented Bat&s;on's coffee-hou&s;e in the city, but had never any calls from thence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex relatione Peter Flood the ma&s;ter of the coffee-hou&s;e, who remembered his coming there.</NOTE>. His biographers abovementioned further &s;ay, that being recommended by Mr. afterwards bi&s;hop Butler, to Mr. Edward Talbot, a &s;on of bi|&s;hop Talbot; that gentleman promi&s;ed in ca&s;e he cho&s;e to take orders in the church, to engage his fa|ther to provide for him, and that fore&s;eeing many ob&s;tacles in his pur&s;uit of this profe&s;&s;ion, Mr. Secker, for he had not then obtained the degree of doctor in his faculty, embraced the offer. They add, that in the &s;ummer of 1720, he was introduced to Mr. Talbot, and that with him he cultivated a clo&s;e acquaint|ance. This I conceive was not till after he had made the experiment abovementioned, and determined on the change of his profe&s;&s;ion. Mr. Talbot's recom|mendation of his friend to his father &s;ucceeded, but he lived not to &s;ee the fruit of it; for in a few months after, he was &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox and died; which la&s;t particular agrees with the following, communicated to me by a per&s;on of unque&s;tionable veracity; viz. that upon the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;order, the &s;ymptoms were very unfavourable, and it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t the eruption, that &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould &s;leep in the &s;ame bed with the patient. Mr. Secker
<PB N="250" REF="255">
voluntarily undertook this office, and though it failed of &s;ucce&s;s, gave a convincing proof of his gratitude to one who&s;e friend&s;hip was likely to prove, as it af|terwards did, the making of his fortunes.</P>
<P>To return from this digre&s;&s;ion, the club in Ivy lane, compo&s;ed of the per&s;ons above de&s;cribed, was a great re|lief to John&s;on after the fatigue of &s;tudy, and he gene|rally came to it with both a corporal and mental appe|tite; for our conver&s;ations &s;eldom began till after a &s;up|per, &s;o very &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial, as led us to think, that with him it was a dinner. By the help of this refec|tion, and no other incentive to hilarity than lemonade, John&s;on was, in a &s;hort time after our a&s;&s;embling, trans|formed into a new creature: his habitual melancholy and la&s;&s;itude of &s;pirit gave way; his countenance brightened; his mind was made to expand, and his wit to &s;parkle: he told excellent &s;tories; and in his didactic &s;tile of conver&s;ation, both in&s;tructed and de|lighted us.</P>
<P>It required, however, on the part of us, who con|&s;idered our&s;elves as his di&s;ciples, &s;ome degree of compliance with his political prejudices: the greater number of our company were whigs, and I was not a tory, and we all &s;aw the prudence of avoiding to call the then late adventurer in Scotland, or his adhe|rents, by tho&s;e names which others he&s;itated not to give them, or to bring to remembrance what had pa&s;&s;ed, a few years before, on Tower-hill. But the greate&s;t of all our difficulties was, to keep alive in John&s;on's mind a &s;en&s;e of the decorum due to the age, character, and profe&s;&s;ion of Dr. Salter, whom he took delight in contradicting, and bringing his learn|ing,
<PB N="251" REF="256">
his judgment, and &s;ometimes his veracity to the te&s;t. And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that John&s;on, though a high-churchman, and by con&s;equence a friend to the clergy as a body of men, was, with re&s;pect to in|dividuals, frequently, not to &s;ay wanting in civility, but to a very great degree &s;plenetic and pertinacious. For this behaviour we could but one way account: He had been bred in an univer&s;ity, and mu&s;t there have had in pro&s;pect tho&s;e advantages, tho&s;e &s;tations in life, or perhaps tho&s;e dignities, which an academic educa|tion leads to. Mi&s;&s;ing the&s;e by his adver&s;e fortunes, he looked on every dignitary under a bi&s;hop, for to tho&s;e of that order he was more than &s;ufficiently re|&s;pectful, and, to de&s;cend lower, on every one that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the emoluments of his profe&s;&s;ion, as occu|pying a &s;tation to which him&s;elf had a better title, and, if his inferior in learning or mental endowments, treat|ed him as little better than an u&s;urper.</P>
<P>Dr. Salter was too much a man of the world to re|&s;ent this behaviour: <Q REND="inline">'Study to be quiet'</Q> &s;eemed to be his rule; and he might po&s;&s;ibly think, that a victory over John&s;on in any matter of di&s;pute, could it have been obtained, would have been dearly purcha&s;ed at the price of peace.

many among them are in general backward in form|ing connections and a&s;&s;ociating with &s;cholars and the learned of the laity, at lea&s;t with men of John&s;on's temper, who, where he had rea&s;on to expect learning, never &s;hewed mercy to ignorance.</P>
<P>Hawke&s;worth was a man of fine parts, but no learn|ing: his reading had been irregular and de&s;ultory: the knowledge he had acquired, he, by the help of a good memory retained, &s;o that it was ready at every call, but on no &s;ubject had he ever formed any &s;y&s;tem. All of ethics that he knew, he had got from Pope's <Q REND="inline">'E&s;&s;ay on Man,'</Q> and Epi&s;tles; he had read the modern French writers, and more particularly the poets, and with the aid of Keill's Introduction, Chambers's Dic|tionary, and other &s;uch common books, had attained &s;uch an in&s;ight into phy&s;ics, as enabled him to talk on the &s;ubject. In the more valuable branches of learn|ing, he was deficient. His office of curator of the Magazine gave him great opportunities of improve|ment, by an exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence with men of all profe&s;&s;ions: it increa&s;ed his little &s;tock of literature, and furni&s;hed him with more than a competent &s;hare of that intelligence which is nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a man for conver&s;ation. He had a good &s;hare of wit, and a vein of humour. With all the&s;e talents, Hawke&s;|worth could be no other than an in&s;tructive and enter|taining companion.</P>
<P>Of a far more valuable kind were the endowments of Dyer; keen penetration and deep erudition were the qualities that &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed his character, that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, John&s;on might almo&s;t be &s;aid to have looked up to him. As the purpo&s;e of our meetings
<PB N="253" REF="258">
was the free communication of &s;entiments, and the enjoyment of &s;ocial intercour&s;e, our conver&s;ations were unre&s;trained, and the &s;ubjects thereof multifarious. Dyer was a divine, a lingui&s;t, a mathematician, a me|taphy&s;ician, a natural philo&s;opher, a cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, and a critic; this John&s;on &s;aw and felt, and never, but in defence of &s;ome fundamental and important truth, would he contradict him. The deference thus &s;hewn by John&s;on to Dyer, may be &s;aid to have been involuntary, or re&s;pect extorted; for in their religious and political &s;entiments their di&s;agreement was &s;o great, that le&s;s of it would, in &s;ome minds, have engendered hatred. Of the fundamental and impor|tant truths above-mentioned, there was one, namely the nature of moral obligation, of which John&s;on was uniformly tenacious. Every one, ver&s;ed in &s;tudies of this kind, knows, that there are, among the moderns, three &s;ects or cla&s;&s;es of writers on morality, who, though perhaps deriving their re&s;pective tenets from the Socratic, the Academic and other ancient &s;chools, are, in the&s;e times, con&s;idered, at lea&s;t, as the guides of &s;ects; the&s;e are the characteri&s;tic lord Shafte&s;bury, Dr. Samuel Clarke, and Mr. Wolla&s;ton: the fir&s;t of the&s;e makes virtue to con&s;i&s;t in a cour&s;e of action con|formable to what is called the moral &s;en&s;e; Wolla&s;ton &s;ays it is acting, in all ca&s;es, according to truth, and treating things as they are; Dr. Clarke &s;uppo&s;es all rational agents as under an obligation to act agreeably to the relations that &s;ub&s;i&s;t between &s;uch, or according to what he calls the fitne&s;s of things. John&s;on was ever an admirer of Clarke, and agreed with him in this and mo&s;t other of his opinions, excepting in that of the
<PB N="254" REF="259">
Trinity, in which he &s;aid, as Dr. Bentley, though no very &s;ound believer, had done before, that Dr. Water|land had foiled him. He therefore fell in with the &s;cheme of fitne&s;s, and thereby profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an ad|ver&s;ary, in the milde&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, and an oppo|nent of Dyer, who, having been a pupil of Hutche&s;on, favoured, notwith&s;tanding his &s;u&s;pected infidelity, this and many other notions and opinions of lord Shafte&s;|bury.</P>
<P>To &s;ay of lord Shafte&s;bury that he was but a &s;u&s;pected infidel, is &s;urely treating him mildly, and I forbear to tax him with unbelief, only becau&s;e in his <Q REND="inline">'Letters to a &s;tudent at the Univer&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A young man, named Michael Ain&s;worth, the &s;on, as I have been informed, of the pari&s;h clerk of Winborne St. Giles in Dor&s;et&s;hire, the &s;eat of the Shafte&s;bury family, whom his lord&s;hip &s;ent to and &s;upported at Oxford, with a view of &s;ettling him in the church, and giving to it a divine of his own forming.

<P>That Dyer &s;hould be a friend to the doctrine of the moral &s;en&s;e, and to the other tenets of this &s;chool, is
<PB N="257" REF="262">
not to be wondered at, &s;eeing that he was a pupil of Hutche&s;on, and that his were the opinions that prevailed at Gla&s;gow, where he taught, and al&s;o at Leyden, whither Dyer and many of his fellow-&s;tudents in that univer&s;ity, removed. Aken&s;ide and Dy&s;on, who were of the number, were deep in this &s;cheme, and al&s;o abettors of that fanciful notion, that ridicule is the te&s;t of truth.</P>
<P>The topics above-mentioned were, not unfrequent|ly, the &s;ubjects of altercation between John&s;on and Dyer, in which it might be ob&s;erved, as John&s;on once did of two di&s;putants, that the one had ball without powder, and the other powder without ball; for Dyer, though be&s;t &s;killed in the controver&s;y, was in|ferior to his adver&s;ary in the power of rea&s;oning, and John&s;on, who was not always ma&s;ter of the que&s;tion, was &s;eldom at a lo&s;s for &s;uch &s;ophi&s;tical arguments as the other was unable to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;putations I had opportunities of ob&s;erv|ing what others have taken occa&s;ion to remark, viz. not only that in conver&s;ation John&s;on made it a rule to talk his be&s;t, but that on many &s;ubjects he was not uniform in his opinions, contending as often for vic|tory as for truth: at one time <HI>good,</HI> at another <HI>evil</HI> was predominant in the moral con&s;titution of the world. Upon one occa&s;ion, he would deplore the non-ob&s;ervance of Good-Friday, and on another deny, that among us of the pre&s;ent age there is any decline of public wor&s;hip. He would &s;ometimes contradict &s;elf-evident propo&s;itions, &s;uch as, that the luxury of this country has increa&s;ed with its riches; and that the practice of card-playing is more general than here|tofore.
<PB N="258" REF="263">
At this ver&s;atility of temper, none, however, took offence; as Alexander and Cae&s;ar were born for conque&s;t, &s;o was John&s;on for the office of a &s;ympo&s;i|arch, to pre&s;ide in all conver&s;ations; and I never yet &s;aw the man who would venture to conte&s;t his right.</P>
<P>Let it not, however, be imagined, that the mem|bers of this our club met together, with the temper of gladiators, or that there was wanting among us a di&s;|po&s;ition to yield to each other in all diver&s;ities of opi|nion; and indeed, di&s;putation was not, as in many a&s;&s;ociations of this kind, the purpo&s;e of our meeting: nor were our conver&s;ations, like tho&s;e of the Rota club, re&s;trained to particular topics.

for not only in John&s;on's melancholy there were lucid intervals, but he was a great contributor to the mirth of conver&s;ation, by the many witty &s;ayings he uttered, and the many excellent &s;tories which his memory had trea&s;ured up, and he would on occa&s;ion relate; &s;o that tho&s;e are greatly mi&s;taken who infer, either from the general tendency of his writings, or that appearance of hebetude which marked his counte|nance when living, and is di&s;cernible in the pictures and prints of him, that he could only rea&s;on and di&s;|cu&s;s, dictate and controul.</P>
<P>In the talent of humour there hardly ever was his equal, except perhaps among the old comedians,

&s;uch as Tarleton, and a few others mentioned by Cibber. By means of this he was enabled to give to any relation that required it, the graces and aids of expre&s;&s;ion, and to di&s;criminate with the nice&s;t ex|actne&s;s the characters of tho&s;e whom it concerned. In aping this faculty I have &s;een Warburton di&s;concerted, and when he would fain have been thought a man of plea&s;antry, not a little out of coun|tenance.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, that John&s;on's motive for the in&s;titution of this &s;ociety was, his love of con|ver&s;ation, and the nece&s;&s;ity he found him&s;elf under of &s;eeking relief from the fatigue of compiling his dicti|onary: the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity operated &s;till farther, and induced him to undertake, what mo&s;t other men would have thought an additional fatigue, the pub|li&s;hing a periodical paper. The truth is, that not having now for a con&s;iderable &s;pace committed to writing aught but words and their &s;ignifications, his mind was become tumid, and laboured to be delivered of tho&s;e many and great conceptions, which for years it had been forming. The &s;tudy of human life and manners, had been the chief employment of his thoughts, and to a knowledge of the&s;e, all his read|ing, all his conver&s;ation, and all his meditations tended. By the&s;e exerci&s;es, and the aid of an ima|gination that was ever teeming with new ideas, he accumulated a fund of moral &s;cience, that was more than &s;ufficient for &s;uch an undertaking, and became in a very eminent degree qualified for the office of an in&s;tructor of mankind in their greate&s;t and mo&s;t important concerns.</P>

I am &s;en&s;ible of the contempt and ridicule with which tho&s;e authors are treated by lord Shafte&s;bury, who, differing from his favourites the ancients, have preferred to their method of writing in &s;oliloquy and dialogue, the more authoritative and didactic form of e&s;&s;ays; but who knows not that the ways by which intelligence and wi&s;dom may be communicated are many and various, and that John&s;on has followed the be&s;t exemplars? What are the &s;apiential books in the Scriptures, and all collections of precepts and coun&s;els, but moral e&s;&s;ays, le&s;&s;ons of oeconomical prudence, and rules for the conduct of human life?</P>
<P>In a full per&s;ua&s;ion of the utility of this mode of in&s;truction, it undoubtedly was, that Montaigne, lord Bacon, O&s;borne, Cowley, Sir William Temple, and others, in tho&s;e excellent di&s;cour&s;es, which they have not &s;crupled to term e&s;&s;ays, have laid out their minds, and communicated to mankind that &s;kill in worldly, and I will add, in heavenly prudence, which is &s;carcely attainable but by long experience, and an exerci&s;e both of the active and contemplative life; and to di&s;&s;eminate and recommend the princi|ples and practice of religion and virtue; as al&s;o, to correct the le&s;&s;er foibles in behaviour, and to render human intercour&s;e ea&s;y and delightful, was the avow|ed de&s;ign of tho&s;e periodical e&s;&s;ays, which, in the be|ginning of this century, contributed to form the man|ners of the then ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>A long &s;pace had intervened &s;ince the publication of the Tatlers, Guardians, and Spectators: it is true it had been filled up by The Lover, and The Reader, The Theatre, The Lay-mona&s;tery, The Plain-dealer,

The Free-thinker, The Speculati&s;t, The Cen&s;or, and other productions of the like kind; but of &s;ome of the&s;e it may be &s;aid, that they were nearly &s;till-born, and of others, that they enjoyed a duration little more extended than that of the ephemeron: &s;o that John&s;on had no competitors for applau&s;e; his way was open, and he had the choice of many paths. Add to this, that a period of near forty years, in a country where commerce and its concomitant luxury had been in|crea&s;ing, had given ri&s;e to new modes of living, and even to characters that had &s;earcely before been known to exi&s;t. The clergyman was now become an amphibious being, that is to &s;ay, both an eccle&s;ia&s;tic and a laic; the &s;tately &s;talking fop, who&s;e gait, as Cibber de&s;cribes it, re&s;embled that of a peacock, was &s;ucceeded by a coxcomb of another &s;pecies, a fidget|ting, tripping animal, that for agility might be com|pared to a gra&s;shopper; the &s;hopkeeper was transform|ed into a merchant, and the par&s;imonious &s;tock-broker into a man of gallantry; the apron, the badge of mechanic occupations, in all its varieties of &s;tuff and colour, was laid a&s;ide; phy&s;icians and lawyers were no longer di&s;tingui&s;hable by their garb; the former had laid a&s;ide the great wig, and the latter cea&s;ed to wear black, except in the actual exerci&s;e of their profe&s;|&s;ions: in &s;hort, a few years of public tranquillity had transformed a whole nation into gentlemen.</P>
<P>In female life the refinements were al&s;o to be noted. In con&s;equence of a better education than it had been u&s;ual to be&s;tow on them, women were become profi|cients in literature, and a man might read a lady's letter without blu&s;hing at the &s;pelling. The convenience

in the writings of the&s;e men, and the point at which free-thinking was likely to terminate; and taking up the defence of religion where Mr. Addi&s;on left it, he made it a part of his de&s;ign as well to adduce new arguments for its &s;upport, and to enforce the practice of virtue, as to correct tho&s;e errors in the &s;maller concerns and occupations of life, the ridiculing which rendered his paper an amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation and &s;tate of public manners John|&s;on formed the plan of his Rambler, and with what &s;pirit he entered upon it may be in&s;erred from the following &s;olemn addre&s;s, which he compo&s;ed and offered up to the divine Being for a ble&s;&s;ing on the undertaking:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Almighty God, the giver of all good things, with|out who&s;e help all labour is ineffectual, and without who&s;e grace all wi&s;dom is folly; grant, I be&s;eech Thee, that in this undertaking thy holy &s;pirit may not be with-held from me, but that I may promote thy glory, and the &s;alvation of my&s;elf and others: grant this, O Lord, for the &s;ake of thy &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Amen.'</Q></P>
<P>The work was undertaken without the commu|nication of his de&s;ign to any of his friends, and con&s;equently without any de&s;ire of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them; it was from the &s;tores of his own mind alone that he hoped to be able to furni&s;h that variety of matter which it would require; which, that it might at no time fail him, he kept up by noting in a common|place book that he carried about him, &s;uch incidents, &s;entiments, and remarks on familiar life and manners as were for his purpo&s;e.

Being thus &s;tored with matter, John&s;on proceeded to publi&s;h his paper; and the fir&s;t number came abroad on Tue&s;day the twentieth day of March, 1750.</P>
<P>It was the office of a cen&s;or of manners to curb the irregularities into which, in the&s;e new modes of living, the youthful of both &s;exes were apt to fall, and this he endeavoured to effect by gentle exhortation, by &s;ober reproof, and, not &s;eldom, by the powers of wit and ridicule; but with what &s;ucce&s;s, others are as well able to tell as my&s;elf; however, if that is to be judged of by the &s;ale of the paper, it was doubtle&s;s great, for though its reception was at fir&s;t cool, and its progre&s;s &s;low, the world were too wi&s;e to &s;uffer it to &s;ink into oblivion: it was collected into volumes, and it would be too much for any one to &s;ay, that ten impre&s;&s;ions of twelve hundred and fifty each, of a book fraught with the &s;ounde&s;t precepts of oecono|mical wi&s;dom, have been di&s;&s;eminated in vain.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t publication of the Rambler it met with a few readers who objected to it for certain particula|rities in the &s;tyle, which they had not been u&s;ed to in papers of the like kind, new and original combina|tions of words, &s;entences of an unu&s;ual form, and words derived from other languages, though accom|modated to the genius of our own; but for the&s;e &s;uch rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned in the clo&s;e of the la&s;t paper, as not only are a defence of them, but &s;hew them to be improvements of our language.</P>
<P>Of &s;ingularity it may be ob&s;erved, that, in general, it is originality, and therefore not a defect, and that all is not tumidity which men of little and con|fined reading plea&s;e to call &s;o. It is from a &s;ervile
<PB N="270" REF="275">
imitation of others, and the u&s;e of whole phra&s;es and &s;entences, and cu&s;tomary combinations of words, that the variety of &s;tyles is not nearly as great as that of faces. The vulgar opinion is, that the &s;tyle of this century is the perfection of our language, and that we owe its ultimate and final improvement to Mr. Addi&s;on, and when we make his cold and languid periods the te&s;t, it is no wonder if we mi&s;take &s;trength and animation for tumidity.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but remark the error and mi&s;|fortune of tho&s;e who are blind to the excellencies of &s;tyle that occur in the works of many Engli&s;h pro&s;e writers of the la&s;t century, which are rejected for no better a rea&s;on, than that in them we &s;ometimes meet with words not now in common u&s;e. A reader ignorant of the &s;tate of our language at different periods, and not conver&s;ant with the writings of ages long pa&s;t, is an incompetent judge of the &s;ubject, and his opinion of &s;tyles of no weight or value. Such a one we may &s;uppo&s;e hardly re&s;trained from cen&s;uring the &s;tyle of our liturgy, compiled for the mo&s;t part &s;o long ago as the reign of Edward the &s;ixth, and the an|tiquated phra&s;e of the &s;tate-papers in the Cabala, the Burleigh, Sidney and Strafforde collections, notwith|&s;tanding they &s;everally contain the mo&s;t perfect models of precatory eloquence and civil negociation.</P>
<P>I find an opinion gaining ground not much to the advantage of Mr. Addi&s;on's &s;tyle, the characteri&s;tics whereof are feeblene&s;s and inanity. I &s;peak of that alone, for his &s;entiments are excellent and his humour exqui&s;ite. In &s;ome in&s;tances he adopts vulgar phra&s;e, as when he calls an indi&s;creet action <HI>a piece</HI> of folly, and too often u&s;es the expletive adverb <HI>along,</HI> thus,
<PB N="271" REF="276">
Come <HI>along</HI> with me. Yet I am not willing to deprive him of the honour implied in John&s;on's te&s;timony, <Q REND="inline">'that his pro&s;e is the model of the middle &s;tyle;'</Q> but if he be but a mediocri&s;t, he is &s;urely not a &s;ubject of imitation; it being a rule, that of examples the be&s;t are always to be &s;elected.</P>
<P>That John&s;on owed his excellence as a writer to the divines and others of the la&s;t century, my&s;elf can atte&s;t, who have been the witne&s;s of his cour&s;e of reading, and heard him declare his &s;entiments of their works. Hooker he admired for his logical preci&s;ion, Sander&s;on for his accutene&s;s, and Taylor for his amazing erudition; Sir Thomas Browne for his pe|netration, and Cowley for the ea&s;e and unaffected &s;tructure of his periods. The tin&s;el of Sprat di&s;|gu&s;ted him, and he could but ju&s;t endure the &s;mooth verbo&s;ity of Tillot&s;on. Hammond and Barrow he thought involved, and of the latter that he was unne|ce&s;&s;arily prolix.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be thought, as his literary acquain|tance was exten&s;ive, and the toil of compiling his dictionary very great, that John&s;on was helped in the publication of the Rambler by the communications of others; but this was not the fact, he forbore to &s;olicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and few pre&s;umed to offer it, &s;o that in the whole &s;eries of tho&s;e papers, we know with cer|tainty of only four that were not of his own writing. Of the&s;e, No. 30, was &s;ent him by Mrs. Catherine Talbot, daughter of Mr. Edward Talbot herein before &s;poken of; No. 97, by Mr. Richard&s;on, the author of Clari&s;&s;a, and numbers 44 and 100, by Mrs. Elizabeth Carter of Deal, a lady to who&s;e reputation for learning,
<PB N="272" REF="277">
and the mo&s;t e&s;timable qualities of her &s;ex, no prai&s;e of mine can make any addition. Hence ari&s;es that uni|formity of &s;ubject and &s;entiment which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Rambler from other papers of the like kind; but how great mu&s;t its merit be, when wanting the charm of variety and that diver&s;ity of characters, which, by the writers of them, was thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep attention awake, it could &s;upport it&s;elf to the end, and make in&s;truction a &s;ub&s;titute for amu&s;ement! Nor can this defect, if it be any, be deemed a devia|tion from John&s;on's original purpo&s;e, which was not &s;o much to in&s;truct young per&s;ons of both &s;exes in the manners of the town, as in that more important &s;cience, the conduct of human life; it being certain, that he had it in his power as well to delight as to in|&s;truct his readers; and this he has in &s;ome in&s;tances done, not only by the introduction of fictitious characters and fancied portraits, but by ironical &s;arca&s;ms and original &s;trokes of wit and humour, that have, per|haps, excited more &s;miles than the writings of many, who&s;e chief purpo&s;e it was, like that of L'E&s;trange and others, to make their readers merry.</P>
<P>And hence we may take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, the error of tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;h &s;o widely between men of &s;tudy and reflection, and &s;uch as are hackneyed in the ways of the world, as to &s;uppo&s;e the latter only qualified to in&s;truct us in the offices of life. Lord Che&s;terfield, in his letters to his &s;on, takes every oc|ca&s;ion to expre&s;s his hatred of an univer&s;ity educa|tion, to brand it with pedantry, and to declare that it unfits a man for &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Some have a&s;&s;erted, that travelling is the only means to attain a

<P>To &s;ay the truth, there are numbers of men who contemn all knowledge derived from books, and pre|fer to it what they call turning over the great volume of the world. I had once a gardener that could not endure the mention of Miller's dictionary, and would contend with me, that <Q REND="inline">'practice was every thing;'</Q> and innumerable are the in&s;tances of men who oppo&s;e mother-wit to acquired intelligence, and had rather grope their way through the world, than be indebted for in&s;truction to the re&s;earches of others. Such men as the&s;e, in &s;ituations they have not been accu&s;tomed to, are ever aukward and diffident; and it is for a rea&s;on nearly a-kin to this, that few rakes are able to look a mode&s;t woman in the face. On the contrary, the attainments of John&s;on were &s;uch as, notwith&s;tanding his home-breeding, gave him confidence, and quali|fied him for the conver&s;ation of per&s;ons of all ranks, conditions, characters, and profe&s;&s;ions, &s;o that no &s;ooner had the Rambler recommended it&s;elf to the favour of the public, and the author was known to be of ea&s;y acce&s;s, than his acquaintance was &s;ought, and even courted, by per&s;ons, of whom many, with all the improvement of travel, and the refinements of court-manners, thought that &s;omewhat worth know|ing was to be learned from the conver&s;ation of a man, who&s;e fortunes and cour&s;e of life had precluded him from the like advantages.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="279">
John&s;on's talent for critici&s;m, both preceptive and corrective, is now known and ju&s;tly celebrated; and had he not di&s;played it in its utmo&s;t lu&s;tre in his Lives of the Poets, we &s;hould have lamented that he was &s;o &s;paring of it in the Rambler, which &s;eemed to be a vehicle, of all others the mo&s;t proper, for that kind of communication. An eulogium on Knolles's Hi&s;|tory of the Turks, and a &s;evere cen&s;ure of the <Q REND="inline">'Sam&s;on Agoni&s;tes'</Q> of Milton are the only critical e&s;&s;ays there to be found; to the latter he &s;eems to have been prompted by no better a motive, than that hatred of the author for his political principles which he is known to have entertained, and was ever ready to avow. What he has remarked of Milton in his Lives of the Poets is undoubtedly true: he was a political enthu&s;ia&s;t, and, as is evident from his panegyric on Cromwell, a ba&s;e and abject flatterer. His &s;tyle in controver&s;y was &s;arca&s;tic and bitter, and not con&s;i&s;tent with chri&s;tian charity; and though his apologi&s;ts endeavour to defend him by the practice of the times, there were in his time better examplars than he cho&s;e to follow, the writings of Jewel, Mede, Hooker, Dr. Jack&s;on, and others, his predece&s;&s;ors in religious and political controver&s;y; nor does he &s;eem in his private character to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many of tho&s;e qualities that mo&s;t endear men to each other. His friends were few, Andrew Marvel, Marchmont Needham, and the younger Vane; and Cyriac Skinner, Harrington, Henry Nevil, John Aubrey, and others, members of that crack-brained a&s;&s;embly the Rota-club, all repub|licans; and there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, from the &s;tern|ne&s;s of his temper, and the rigid di&s;cipline of his
<PB N="275" REF="280">
family, that his dome&s;tic manners were far from amiable, and that he was neither a kind hu&s;band nor an indulgent parent. But neither the&s;e nor tho&s;e other qualities that rendered him both a bitter enemy and a railing di&s;putant, could ju&s;tify the &s;everity of John&s;on's critici&s;m on the above-mentioned poem, nor apologize for that har&s;h and groundle&s;s cen&s;ure which clo&s;es the fir&s;t of his di&s;cour&s;es on it, that it is <Q REND="inline">'a tragedy which ignorance has admired, and bigotry applauded.'</Q></P>
<P>The reflection on that enmity of John&s;on towards Milton, which I have above remarked, leads me to mention another in&s;tance of it, which about this time fell under my ob&s;ervation. A man of the name of Lauder, a native of Scotland, and educated in the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, had, for rea&s;ons that will hereafter be given, conceived a hatred again&s;t the memory of Milton, and formed a &s;cheme to con|vict him of plagiari&s;m, by &s;hewing that he had in&s;erted in the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t whole pa&s;&s;ages taken from the writings of &s;undry modern Latin poets, namely, Ma&s;enius the je&s;uit, Taubman a German profe&s;&s;or, the editor of Virgil, and joint editor with Gruter of Plautus, Staphor&s;tius a Dutch divine, and other writers le&s;s known; and of this crime he attempted to prove him guilty, by publi&s;hing in&s;tances in forged quotations, in&s;erted from time to time in the <Q REND="inline">'Gentleman's Magazine,'</Q> which not being detected, he made additions to, and again publi&s;hed in a volume intitled <Q REND="inline">'An E&s;&s;ay on Milton's u&s;e of and imitation of the moderns in his Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, dedicated to the Univer&s;ities of Oxford and Cam|bridge, 8vo. 1750.'</Q> While the book was in the
<PB N="276" REF="281">
pre&s;s, the proof &s;heets were &s;ubmitted to the in|&s;pection of our club, by a member of it who had an intere&s;t in its publication, and I could all along ob&s;erve that John&s;on &s;eemed to approve, not only of the de&s;ign but of the argument, and &s;eemed to exult in a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the reputation of Milton was likely to &s;uffer by this di&s;covery. That he was not privy to the impo&s;ture I am well per&s;uaded, but that he wi&s;hed well to the argument mu&s;t be inferred from the preface, which indubitably was written by John&s;on.</P>
<P>The charges of plagiari&s;m contained in this produc|tion, Lauder has attempted to make out by citations to a very great number, from a Latin poem of Jacobus Ma&s;enius a je&s;uit, intitled, <Q REND="inline">'Palae&s;tra ligatae eloquen|tiae,'</Q> from the <Q REND="inline">'Adamus exul'</Q> of Grotius, the <Q REND="inline">'Trium|phus Pacis'</Q> of Ca&s;par Staphor&s;tius a Dutchman, from the Latin poems of Ca&s;par Barlaeus, and the works of many other writers. For a time the world gave credit to them, and Milton's reputation was &s;inking under them, till a clergyman of great worth, learn|ing and indu&s;try, Mr. now Dr. John Douglas, prompted at fir&s;t by mere curio&s;ity, &s;et him&s;elf to find out and compare the parallel pa&s;&s;ages, in the doing whereof he di&s;covered, that in a quotation from Staphor&s;tius, Lauder had interpolated eight lines taken from a Latin tran&s;lation of the Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, by a man named Hogaeus or Hog, and oppo&s;ed them to the pa&s;&s;age in the original, as evidence of Milton's plagiari&s;m. Proofs of the like fraud in pa&s;&s;ages cited from Taubman and many others are produced by Dr. Douglas; but a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the kind would have been &s;ufficient to bla&s;t the credit of his adver&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="282">
Having made the&s;e di&s;coveries, Dr. Douglas com|municated them to the world in a pamphlet intitled, <Q REND="inline">'Milton vindicated from the charge of plagiari&s;m, brought again&s;t him by Mr. Lauder, &amp;c. 8vo. 1750.'</Q> Upon the publication thereof his book&s;el|lers called on Lauder for a ju&s;tification of them&s;elves, and a confirmation of the charge; but he, with a degree of impudence not to be exceeded, acknow|ledged the interpolation of the books by him cited, and &s;eemed to wonder at <Q REND="inline">'the folly of mankind in making &s;uch a rout about eighteen or twenty lines.'</Q> However, being a &s;hort time after convinced by John|&s;on and others, that it would be more for his intere&s;t to make an ample confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, than to &s;et mankind at defiance, and &s;tigmatize them with folly; he did &s;o in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Douglas, pub|li&s;hed in quarto, 1751, beginning thus:</P>

pa&s;&s;ages which I have in&s;erted in my quotations made known to the world, and the &s;hade which began to gather on the &s;plendour of Milton totally di&s;per&s;ed, I cannot but count it an allevation of my pain, that I have been defeated by a man who knows how to u&s;e advantages with &s;o much mode|ration, and can enjoy the honour of conque&s;t with|outthe in&s;olence of triumph.</P>
<P>'It was one of the maxims of the Spartans, not to pre&s;s upon a flying army, and therefore their enemies were always ready to quit the field, becau&s;e they knew the danger was only in oppo&s;ing.

<P><PB N="282" REF="287">
With this que&s;tion I meddle not; I have only to ob&s;erve upon Lauder's pamphlet, that the argument is introduced by a defence of his e&s;&s;ay, and an a&s;&s;ertion, that his letter, which he &s;ays was written by John&s;on, in many re&s;pects contained not his &s;entiments, and was, more properly than an apology, an enormous ag|gravation of his offence; and is pur&s;ued with a declaration of the author, in the &s;incerity of his heart, that had not Milton with &s;uch unparalleled malignity bla&s;ted the king, he would not upon any con&s;ideration have either offered a violence to truth, put an impo|&s;ition on the public, though but for a moment, or attempted to bla&s;t Milton's reputation by a fal|&s;hood.</P>
<P>Behold here a rea&s;on far differing from each of the two former; the fir&s;t was a provocation given him by a di&s;tich of Mr. Pope's, the &s;econd was a de&s;ire by a &s;tratagem, as he calls it, to try how far the partiality of Milton's admirers would lead them, and this la&s;t is, his re&s;entment of an injury done to the memory of king Charles the fir&s;t. If we a&s;k, which of the&s;e is the true one? the an&s;wer mu&s;t be, neither; for it ap|pears that Lauder had projected an edition of Ma&s;e|nius and other of the Latin poets referred to in his e&s;&s;ay, and that in order to obtain &s;ub&s;criptions for the &s;ame, he had been guilty of the wickedne&s;s imputed to and proved upon him.</P>

As this man then has been guilty of &s;uch a wicked impo&s;ition upon us, our friends, and the public, and is capable of &s;o daring an avowal of it, we declare, that we will have no farther intercour&s;e with him, and that we now &s;ell his book only as a curio&s;ity of fraud and interpolation, which all the ages of literature cannot parallel!'</Q></P>
<P>With a character thus bla&s;ted, it was next to im|po&s;&s;ible for this man to continue in England; he therefore left it, and went to &s;ettle at Barbadoes, pro|po&s;ing to &s;et up a &s;chool there; but, upon his arrival on the i&s;land, he met with &s;mall encouragement, and is &s;aid to have died about the year 1771.</P>

It is too &s;ad a truth, that learning and rectitude of mind are qualities independent of each other, and that the world has in all ages abounded with examples of men of great erudition who have been wanting in common hone&s;ty. We read of men who have cor|rupted

the Holy Scriptures with a view to favour a particular here&s;y; and of monks who have forged charters to promote the &s;ecular intere&s;ts of their fra|ternity: the&s;e, though wicked actions, mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;prung from a principle, which, having for its object a common benefit, had &s;omewhat of genero&s;ity in it: but the motives of this impo&s;tor were all of the &s;elfi&s;h kind, revenge for a &s;uppo&s;ed injury done to him&s;elf, and an impatience to be re|lieved from his own peculiar and per&s;onal wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and though it was for &s;ome time thought that his confe&s;&s;ion had atoned for his offence, we find it was in fact an aggravation of it: In as much as it was not &s;incere, it was a repentance to be re|pented of; and indeed in one &s;en&s;e he &s;eems to have thought &s;o, for, in his la&s;t publication, he retracts it, and that nothing might be wanting to fill up the mea&s;ure of his iniquity, he defies his detector, who&s;e endeavours were to beget in him that &s;en&s;e of &s;hame which, as it is ever the forerunner of penitence, has ever been deemed &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Great thanks are due to this learned divine and eminent &s;cholar for the zeal and indu&s;try manife&s;ted by him in the cour&s;e of this &s;ingular controver&s;y, and every judicious reader mu&s;t rejoice, that through his means our great poet has been re&s;cued from an infamous charge, and that we may yet read the <Q REND="inline">'Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t'</Q> without a &s;u&s;picion of its ori|ginality.</P>
<P>To return to John&s;on, I have already &s;aid that he paid no regard to time or the &s;tated hours of refection, or even re&s;t; and of this his inattention I will here relate a notable in&s;tance. Mrs. Lenox, a lady now well known
<PB N="286" REF="291">
in the literary world, had written a novel intitled, <Q REND="inline">'The life of Harriot Stuart,'</Q> which in the &s;pring of 1751, was ready for publication. One evening at the club, John&s;on propo&s;ed to us the celebrating the birth of Mrs. Lenox's fir&s;t literary child, as he called her book, by a whole night &s;pent in fe&s;tivity. Upon his men|tioning it to me, I told him I had never &s;at up a whole night in my life; but he continuing to pre&s;s me, and &s;aying, that I &s;hould find great delight in it, I, as did all the re&s;t of our company, con&s;ented. The place appointed was the Devil tavern, and there, about the hour of eight, Mrs. Lenox and her hu&s;band, and a lady of her acquaintance, now living, as al&s;o the club, and friends to the number of near twenty, a&s;&s;embled. Our &s;upper was elegant, and John&s;on had directed that a magnificent hot apple-pye &s;hould make a part of it, and this he would have &s;tuck with bay-leaves, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, Mrs. Lenox was an authore&s;s, and had written ver&s;es; and further, he had prepar|ed for her a crown of laurel, with which, but not till he had invoked the mu&s;es by &s;ome ceremonies of his own invention, he encircled her brows. The night pa&s;&s;ed, as mu&s;t be imagined, in plea&s;ant conver|&s;ation, and harmle&s;s mirth, intermingled at different periods with the refre&s;hments of coffee and tea. About five, John&s;on's face &s;hone with meridian &s;plen|dour, though his drink had been only lemonade; but the far greater part of us had de&s;erted the colours of Bacchus, and were with difficulty rallied to partake of a &s;econd refre&s;hment of coffee, which was &s;carcely ended when the day began to dawn. This pheno|menon began to put us in mind of our reckoning;
<PB N="287" REF="292">
but the waiters were all &s;o overcome with &s;leep, that it was two hours before we could get a bill, and it was not till near eight that the creaking of the &s;treet-door gave the &s;ignal for our departure.</P>
<P>My mirth had been con&s;iderably abated by a &s;evere fit of the tooth-ach, which had troubled me the greater part of the night, and which Bathur&s;t endeavoured to alleviate by all the topical remedies and palliatives he could think of; and I well remember, at the in&s;tant of my going out of the tavern-door, the &s;en&s;ation of &s;hame that affected me, occa&s;ioned not by reflection on any thing evil that had pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the night's entertainment, but on the re&s;emblance it bore to a debauch. However, a few turns in the Temple, and a breakfa&s;t at a neighbouring coffee-hou&s;e, enabled me to overcome it.</P>
<P>In the foregoing pages I have a&s;&s;igned the motives that induced John&s;on to the in&s;titution of the club, and the writing of the Rambler; and here I may add, that his view in both was &s;o far an&s;wered, as that the amu&s;ements they afforded him contributed, not only to relieve him from the fatigue of his great work the dictionary, but that they &s;erved to divert that me|lancholy, which the public now too well knows was the di&s;ea&s;e of his mind. For this morbid affection, as he was u&s;ed to call it, no cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned; nor will it gratify curio&s;ity to &s;ay, it was con&s;tituional, or that it di&s;covered it&s;elf in his early youth, and haunted him in his hours of recreation; and it is but a &s;urmi&s;e that it might be a latent concomitant of that di&s;ea&s;e, which, in his infancy, had induced his mother to &s;eek relief from the royal touch. His
<PB N="288" REF="293">
own conjecture was, that he derived it from his father, of whom he was u&s;ed to &s;peak as of a man in who&s;e temper and character melancholy was predominant. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, he at the age of about twenty, drew up a &s;tate of his ca&s;e for the opinion of an eminent phy&s;ician in Stafford&s;hire, and from him received an an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">'that from the &s;ymptoms therein de&s;cribed, he could think nothing better of his di&s;order, than that it had a tendency to in|&s;anity; and without great care might po&s;&s;ibly ter|minate in the deprivation of his rational faculties.'</Q> The dread of &s;o great a calamity was one inducement with him to ab&s;tain from wine at certain periods of his life, when his fears in this re&s;pect were greate&s;t; but it was not without &s;ome reluctance that he did it, for he has often been heard to declare, that wine was to him &s;o great a cordial, that it required all his re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t the temptations to ebriety.</P>
<P>It was fortunate for the public, that during a period of two years, the depre&s;&s;ion of his mind was at no time &s;o great as to incapacitate him for &s;ending forth a number of the Rambler on the days on which it became due; nor did any of the e&s;&s;ays or di&s;cour&s;es therein contained, either in the choice of &s;ubjects or the manner of treating them, indicate the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of drooping faculties or la&s;&s;itude of &s;pirit. Neverthele&s;s, whether the con&s;tant meditation on &s;uch topics as mo&s;t frequently occur therein, had not produced in his mind a train of ideas that were now become unea&s;y to him, or whether, that inten&s;e|ne&s;s of thought which he mu&s;t have exerted, fir&s;t, in the conception, and next, in the delivery of &s;uch
<PB N="289" REF="294">
original and noble &s;entiments as the&s;e papers abound with, had not made the relaxation of his mind ne|ce&s;&s;ary, he thought proper to di&s;continue the Rambler at a time when its reputation was but in its dawn.</P>
<P>The paper in which this his re&s;olution is an|nounced, is that of March 14, 1752, which concludes the work. As he had given his readers no warning of his intention, they were unprepared for the &s;hock, and had the mortification to receive the tid|ings and the blow at the &s;ame in&s;tant, with the ag|gravation of a &s;ympathetic melancholy, excited by the mournful expre&s;&s;ions with which he takes his leave. And though he affects to think the rea&s;ons for di&s;continuing the publication a &s;ecret to his rea|ders, it is but too apparent that it was written in the hours of dejection, and that the want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance and encouragement was not the weake&s;t of his mo|tives. Of the former of the&s;e two he had &s;urely no right to complain, for he was &s;o far from being ever known to wi&s;h for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that his mo&s;t intimate friends &s;eemed to think it would have been pre&s;ump|tion to offer it. The want of encouragement indeed might be a ju&s;tifiable cau&s;e of di&s;content, for I have rea&s;on to think that the number of papers taken off hardly amounted to five hundred on any of the days of publication. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;low circulation of the paper was to be accounted for by other rea&s;ons than that the author was never a favourite with the public, a reflection that would have been but excu&s;|able, had his imitations of Juvenal become wa&s;te paper, or his Irene, in&s;tead of being &s;uffered to run nine nights, been con&s;igned to oblivion on the fir&s;t;

He had excellent natural parts, and, by reading the modern Engli&s;h and French au|thors, had acquired a &s;tyle, which, by his acquaintance with John&s;on he had improved into a very good one. He wrote ver&s;es, that is to &s;ay in Engli&s;h, with ea&s;e

and fluency, and was better acquainted with the world than mo&s;t men are who have been bred to no profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of the&s;e papers, like tho&s;e of the Rambler, are human life and manners, with a mixture of humour and in&s;tructive plea&s;antry, critici&s;m, and moral and religious exhortation, too various, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, for the powers of a &s;ingle per&s;on: they are therefore the produce of different pens, and may owe their merit, in a great mea&s;ure, to that diver&s;ity. The curio&s;ity of the reader is, to a &s;mall degree, gra|tified by the la&s;t paper, which a&s;&s;igns to their author, Dr. Jo&s;eph Warton, &s;uch as have a certain &s;ignature, and leaves to Dr. Hawke&s;worth him&s;elf the prai&s;e of &s;uch as are without any.

<P>As John&s;on expected to be believed whenever he either &s;poke or wrote, he has not vouch&s;afed to cite any authority for the incredible relation, which the Adventurer contains, of the per&s;onal and mental en|dowments of a man who is de&s;cribed as a mon&s;ter both of erudition and prowe&s;s, and in every other view of his character is repre&s;ented as having pa&s;&s;ed the limits of humanity. That he had no authority for what he has related of him, would be too much to &s;ay, after he has a&s;&s;erted, that he had &s;uch as was inconte&s;tible, yet having that, he has kept within the bounds of it, and ca&s;t a veil over that blaze of glory, which, to gaze on in its naked &s;plendour, would not dazzle but blind the beholder.</P>

con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch activity and &s;trength, that in fencing, he would &s;pring at one bound the length of twenty feet upon his antagoni&s;t; and he u&s;ed his &s;word in either hand with &s;uch force and dex|terity, that &s;carce any one had courage to engage him.</P><P>'Having &s;tudied at St. Andrew's in Scotland, he went to Paris in his twenty-fir&s;t year, and affixed on the gate of the college of Navarre a kind of challenge to the learned of that univer&s;ity, to di&s;|pute with him on a certain day; offering to his opponents, whoever they &s;hould be, the choice of ten languages, and of all the faculties and &s;ciences. On the day appointed, three thou&s;and auditors a&s;&s;embled, when four doctors of the church and fifty ma&s;ters appeared again&s;t him; and one of his antagoni&s;ts confe&s;&s;es, that the doctors were de|feated, that he gave proofs of knowledge above the reach of man, and that a hundred years pa&s;&s;|ed without food or &s;leep, would not be &s;ufficient for the attainment of his learning. After a di&s;|putation of nine hours, he was pre&s;ented by the pre&s;ident and profe&s;&s;ors with a diamond and a pur&s;e of gold, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with repeated accla|mations.</P><P>'From Paris he went away to Rome, where he made the &s;ame challenge, and had, in the pre&s;ence of the pope and cardinals, the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. After|wards he contracted at Venice an acquaintance with Aldus Manutius, by whom he was introduced to the learned of that city; then vi&s;ited Padua, where he engaged in another public di&s;putation, beginning
<PB N="296" REF="301">
his performance with an extemporal poem in prai&s;e of the city and the a&s;&s;embly then pre&s;ent, and con|cluding with an oration equally unpremeditated in commendation of ignorance.</P><P>'He afterwards publi&s;hed another challenge, in which he declared him&s;elf ready to detect the errors of Ari&s;totle and all his commentators, either in the common forms of logic, or in any which his anta|goni&s;ts &s;hould propo&s;e of a hundred different kinds of ver&s;e.</P>
<P>'The&s;e acqui&s;itions of learning, however &s;tupen|dous, were not gained at the expence of any plea&s;ure which youth generally indulges, or by the omi&s;&s;ion of any accompli&s;hment in which it becomes a gen|tleman to excel: he practi&s;ed, in great perfection, the arts of drawing and painting; he was an eminent performer in both vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; he danced with uncommon gracefulne&s;s; and on the day after his di&s;putation at Paris, exhibited his &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip before the court of France, where, at a public match of tilting, he bore away the ring upon his lance fifteen times toge|ther.</P>
<P>'He excelled likewi&s;e in dome&s;tic games of le&s;s dignity and reputation; and in the interval be|tween his challenge and di&s;putation at Paris, he &s;pent &s;o much of his time at cards, dice, and tennis, that a lampoon was fixed upon the gate of the Sorbonne, directing tho&s;e that would &s;ee this mon&s;ter of erudition, to look for him at the tavern.</P>
<P>'So exten&s;ive was his acquaintance with life and manners, that in an Italian comedy, compo&s;ed by
<PB N="297" REF="302">
him&s;elf, and exhibited before the court of Mantua, he is &s;aid to have per&s;onated fifteen different cha|racters; in all which he might &s;ucceed without great difficulty, &s;ince he had &s;uch power of reten|tion, that once hearing an oration of an hour, he would repeat it exactly, and in the recital follow the &s;peaker through all his variety of tone and ge&s;|ticulation.</P>
<P>'Nor was his &s;kill in arms le&s;s than in learning, or his courage inferior to his &s;kill: there was a prize-fighter in Mantua, who travelling about the world, according to the barbarous cu&s;tom of that age, as a general challenger, had defeated the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters in many parts of Europe; and in Mantua, where he then re&s;ided, had killed three that appeared again&s;t him. The duke repented that he had granted him his protection; when Crichton, looking on his &s;anguinary &s;ucce&s;s with indignation, offered to &s;take fifteen hundred pi&s;toles, and mount the &s;tage again&s;t him. The duke, with &s;ome re|luctance, con&s;ented, and, on the day fixed, the com|batants appeared: their weapons &s;eem to have been &s;ingle rapier, which was then newly intro|duced in Italy. The prize-fighter advanced with great violence and fiercene&s;s, and Crichton con|tented him&s;elf calmly to ward his pa&s;&s;es, and &s;uffered him to exhau&s;t his vigour by his own fury: Crichton then became the a&s;&s;ailant; and pre&s;&s;ed upon him with &s;uch force and agility, that he thru&s;t him thrice through the body, and &s;aw him expire: he then divided the prize he had won, among the widows who&s;e hu&s;bands had been killed.</P><P><PB N="298" REF="303">
'The death of this wonderful man I &s;hould be willing to conceal, did I not know that every rea|der will enquire curiou&s;ly after that fatal hour, which is common to all human beings, however di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by nature or by fortune.</P>
<P>'The duke of Mantua having received &s;o many proofs of his various merit, made him tutor to his &s;on Vincentio di Gonzaga, a prince of loo&s;e man|ners and turbulent di&s;po&s;ition. On this occa&s;ion it was, that he compo&s;ed the comedy in which he ex|hibited &s;o many different characters with exact propriety. But his honour was of &s;hort continuance, for as he was one night in the time of Carnival rambling about the &s;treets with his guitar in his hand, he was attacked by &s;ix men ma&s;ked. Nei|ther his courage nor &s;kill, in this exigence de&s;erted him: he oppo&s;ed them with &s;uch activity and &s;pirit, that he &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and di&s;armed their leader, who throwing off his ma&s;k, di&s;covered him|&s;elf to be the prince his pupil. Crichton falling on his knees, took his own &s;word by the point, and pre&s;ented it to the prince, who immediately &s;eized it, and in&s;tigated, as &s;ome &s;ay, by jealou&s;y, accord|ing to others, only by drunken fury and brutal re|&s;entment, thru&s;t him through the heart.</P>
<P>'Thus was the Admirable Crichton brought into that &s;tate, in which he could excel the meane&s;t of mankind only by a few empty honours paid to his memory: the court of Mantua te&s;tified their e&s;teem by a public mourning; the contemporary wits were profu&s;e of their encomiums; and the
<PB N="299" REF="304">
palaces of Italy were adorned with pictures repre|&s;enting him on hor&s;eback, with a lance in one hand and a book in the other.'</P></Q></P>
<P>The above account is &s;o defective in the evidences of hi&s;torical verity, that it has been by &s;ome &s;u&s;pected to be fabulous.

<P>The &s;everal exploits of Crichton, above-related, as they appear upon the face of Sir Thomas Urquhart's book, are, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, un&s;upported by any cita|tions from hi&s;tory, or the writings of contemporary bio|graphers, or other narrators of remarkable tran&s;actions, and may, therefore, in the judgment of tho&s;e who re|flect on the hyperbolical &s;tyle of the author, and the extravagancies to which &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit as his will lead men, &s;tand in need of &s;till farther proof. Happily, &s;ince the publication of the Adventurer, &s;uch evidence has been laid before the public, as mu&s;t remove all doubt of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a per&s;on as Crichton, and of the truth of the facts above-related of him.</P>
<P>For this information we are indebted to Mr. Pen|nant, who, in his tour to Scotland, vol. I. page 295, confirms the account of Sir Thomas Urquhart in all its particulars, vouching, as his authority, Aldus Ma|nutius, Joannes Imperialis, a phy&s;ician of Vicenza, and a writer whom I take to be E&s;tienne Pa&s;quier, two of whom were per&s;onally acquainted with him, and eye-witne&s;&s;es to the triumphs by them &s;everally recorded. From Aldus Manutius we learn, that Crichton was a &s;cholar of Buchanan.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="314">
Mr. Pennant has further obliged the public with &s;ome Latin ver&s;es of Crichton's writing, and an en|graving of him from an original portrait.</P>
<P>From all which te&s;timonies, it is but a nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion, that whatever may be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, as pa&s;&s;ing credibility, of the per&s;on here celebrated, enough is, upon inconte&s;table authority, related, to induce us to rank him among prodigies.</P>
<P>That John&s;on dictated this number of the Adven|turer, I have already &s;aid: that he did not him&s;elf write it may be thus accounted for; he had doubt|le&s;s red the hi&s;tory of Crichton in Sir Thomas Ur|quhart's book, and retained it with that firmne&s;s of memory, which held fa&s;t almo&s;t every thing that he met with in books. Suppo&s;ing him, as we may, too indolent to recur to one that he had formerly red through, and, in the hearing of Hawke&s;worth, to have related the tran&s;actions of &s;o wonderful a man, the latter might catch at it as a fit &s;ubject for an e&s;&s;ay, and give it to the world, as he has done in the Ad|venturer. To which we may add, that John&s;on was &s;eldom a narrator of events: his talent was original thinking; in conver&s;ation he told &s;tories, and related hi&s;torical facts with great preci&s;ion, but rarely &s;ent them abroad in writing.</P>
<P>We are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that that &s;orene&s;s of mind, which John&s;on &s;eems to have felt at the time of his di&s;continuing the Rambler, was, in the &s;hort interval of &s;ix months, &s;o completely healed, as to render him a di&s;intere&s;ted candidate for prai&s;e in this new publi|cation; or that he who had declared, that he could not compo&s;e a &s;ermon, gratis, would write an Adven|turer, without being hired to it: on the contrary, it
<PB N="310" REF="315">
is certain, that he retained his old maxim, that gain was the only genuine &s;timulative to literary exertion, and that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he gave to this publication was purcha&s;ed at two guineas, for every number that he had fini&s;hed; a rate of payment which he had before adju&s;ted in his &s;tipulation for the Rambler, and was probably the mea&s;ure of a reward to his fellow-labourers.</P>
<P>The avowed end of the Adventurer, being the &s;ame with that of the Rambler, and the plan and conduct thereof &s;o little different from it, the latter may be con&s;idered as a continuation of the former: never|thele&s;s, it may be ob&s;erved, that in the Adventurer, the number of entertaining papers, of portraits, &s;ingular characters, and e&s;&s;ays of wit, humour, and plea&s;antry, is greater, in proportion, than in the Rambler; and to that diver&s;ity it was doubtle&s;s owing, that the circulation of it was more diffu&s;e. On the part of the writers it was carried on with great vigour, and, together with the Rambler, is likely to remain a la&s;t|ing evidence of the &s;pirit that dictated, and the public good &s;en&s;e that encouraged, &s;uch a &s;eries, as they both contain, of religious in&s;truction, oeconomical wi&s;dom, and innocent delight.</P>
<P>Hawke&s;worth has, almo&s;t in terms, declared him|&s;elf the editor of the Adventurer, and that the other contributors thereto were merely auxiliaries; and his zeal for its &s;ucce&s;s may be inferred from the number of papers written by him&s;elf, which, upon a compa|ri&s;on, will be found nearly equal to that of all the re&s;t. This zeal was excited by a motive far more &s;trong than any which actuated his co-adjutors, a de&s;ire of advantage in his then profe&s;&s;ion, which o&s;ten&s;ibly was
<PB N="311" REF="316">
that of a governor of a &s;chool for the education of young females, by making him&s;elf known as a judge of life and manners, and capable of qualifying tho&s;e of riper years for the important relations of dome&s;tic &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But while he was indulging a well-grounded hope to reap this fruit of his &s;tudies, a reward of a very different kind courted his acceptance. The arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, Dr. Herring, his dioce&s;an and neighbour, having peru&s;ed his e&s;&s;ays, and informed him&s;elf of his general character, made him an offer of a faculty that &s;hould rai&s;e him above the level of vulgar literati, and, almo&s;t without his being con|&s;cious of any &s;uch exaltation, create him a doctor of both laws, and the honour was accepted.</P>
<P>Among men of real learning, there is but one opi|nion concerning what are called Lambeth degrees. The right of conferring them is a relic of the power anciently exerci&s;ed in this country by the legates of the pope, and is, by &s;tatute, transferred to the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. It received a legal &s;anction in the determination, about the year 1720, of the ca&s;e of the warden of Manche&s;ter college. Degrees of this kind are often convenient for clergymen, as they are quali|fications for a plurality of livings, but, as they imply nothing more than favour, convey little or no honour.</P>
<P>But Hawke&s;worth was &s;o far mi&s;taken in his notion of this act of kindne&s;s of the archbi&s;hop, that though he had never red Ju&s;tinian, nor perhaps ever &s;een the Corpus Juris Civilis, or Corpus Juris Canonici, he conceived him&s;elf tran&s;muted by it into a civilian and a canoni&s;t, and qualified for an advocate in either of tho&s;e judicatures where the above laws are &s;everally recogni&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="317">
In con&s;equence of this per&s;ua&s;ion, he made an effort to be admitted a pleader in the courts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, but met with &s;uch an oppo&s;ition as ob|liged him to de&s;i&s;t. Upon this, he bent his cour&s;e another way, and, recurring to his fir&s;t de&s;ign of con|verting his &s;chool into a kind of female academy, &s;uc|ceeded, not more to his own emolument, than the improvement of tho&s;e who participated in the benefits of his tuition.</P>
<P>In this train of events, and others that are well enough known, it may be di&s;cerned, that Hawke&s;|worth was a greater gainer by the Adventurer than any of tho&s;e concerned in it. His &s;ucce&s;s, however, wrought no good effects upon his mind and conduct; it elated him too much, and betrayed him into a for|getfulne&s;s of his origin, and a neglect of his early ac|quaintance; and on this I have heard John&s;on re|mark, in terms that &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed a knowledge of his character, and a re&s;entment of his behaviour. It is probable that he might u&s;e the &s;ame language to Hawke&s;worth him&s;elf, and al&s;o reproach him with the acceptance of an academical honour to which he could have no preten&s;ions, and, which John&s;on, conceiving to be irregular, as many yet do, held in great con|tempt; thus much is certain, that &s;oon after the at|tainment of it, the intimacy between them cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The expedients above-mentioned, and the vi&s;its of a variety of friends, which his writings had procured him, afforded John&s;on great relief, and enabled him to keep at a bay tho&s;e terrors, which were almo&s;t ince&s;|&s;antly a&s;&s;ailing him, till the beginning of the year 1752, O.S. when it plea&s;ed God to try him by a ca|lamity, which was very near realizing all tho&s;e evils
<PB N="313" REF="318">
which, for a &s;eries of years, he had dreaded: this was the lo&s;s of his wife, who, on the 28th day of March, and after &s;eventeen years cohabitation, left him a childle&s;s widower, abandoned to &s;orrow, and incapable of con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were be&s;t acquainted with them both, wondered that John&s;on could derive no comfort from the u&s;ual re&s;ources, reflections on the conditions of mortality, the in&s;tability of human happine&s;s, re&s;ig|nation to the divine will, and other topics; and the more, when they con&s;idered, that their marriage was not one of tho&s;e which incon&s;iderate young people call love-matches, and that &s;he was more than old enough to be his mother; that, as their union had not been productive of children, the medium of a new relation between them was wanting; that her inat|tention to &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the duties of a wife, were evident in the per&s;on of her hu&s;band, who&s;e negli|gence of dre&s;s &s;eemed never to have received the lea&s;t correction from her, and who, in the &s;ordidne&s;s of his apparel, and the complexion of his linen, even &s;hamed her. For the&s;e rea&s;ons I have often been inclined to think, that if this fondne&s;s of John&s;on for his wife was not di&s;&s;embled, it was a le&s;&s;on that he had learned by rote, and that, when he practi&s;ed it, he knew not where to &s;top till he became ridicu|lous. It is true, he has celebrated her per&s;on in the word formo&s;ae, which he cau&s;ed to be in&s;cribed on her grave-&s;tone; but could he, with that imperfection in his &s;ight which made him &s;ay, in the words of Milton, he never &s;aw the human face divine, have been a witne&s;s of her beauty? which we may &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="314" REF="319">
had &s;u&s;tained &s;ome lo&s;s before he married; her daughter by her former hu&s;band being but little younger than John&s;on him&s;elf. As, during her life|time, he invited but few of his friends to his hou&s;e, I never &s;aw her, but I have been told by Mr. Garrick, Dr. Hawke&s;worth, and others, that there was &s;omewhat crazy in the behaviour of them both; profound re&s;pect on his part, and the airs of an antiquated beauty on her's. John&s;on had not then been u&s;ed to the company of women, and nothing but his conver&s;ation rendered him tolerable among them: it was, therefore, nece&s;|&s;ary that he &s;hould practice his be&s;t manners to one whom, as &s;he was de&s;cended from an ancient family, and had brought him a fortune, he thought his &s;u|perior. This, after all, mu&s;t be &s;aid, that he la|boured to rai&s;e his opinion of her to the highe&s;t, by in&s;erting in many of her books of devotion that I have &s;een, &s;uch endearing memorials as the&s;e: <Q REND="inline">'This was dear Tetty's book.'&mdash;'This was a prayer which dear Tetty was accu&s;tomed to &s;ay,'</Q> not to mention his frequent recollection of her in his meditations, and the &s;ingularity of his prayers re&s;pect|ing her.</P>
<P>To &s;o high a pitch had he worked his remembrance of her, that he reque&s;ted a divine, of his acquaintance, to preach a &s;ermon at her interment, which, probably, he would have written him&s;elf, but was di&s;&s;uaded from &s;o o&s;tentatious a di&s;play of the virtues of a woman, who, though &s;he was his wife, was but little known. He intended al&s;o to have depo&s;ited her remains in the chapel in Tothill fields, We&s;tmin&s;ter, but, altering his mind, he committed the di&s;po&s;al of them to his friend
<PB N="315" REF="320">
Hawke&s;worth, who buried her in his own pari&s;h|church of Bromley in Kent, under a black marble &s;tone, on which John&s;on him&s;elf, a few months be|fore his death, cau&s;ed the following memorial to be in&s;cribed:<Q>Hic conduntur reliquiae <LB>ELIZABETHAE <LB>Antiqua Jarvi&s;iorum gente, <LB>Peatlingae, apud Leice&s;trien&s;es, ortae; <LB>Formo&s;ae, cultae, ingenio&s;ae, piae; <LB>Uxoris, primis nuptiis, HENRICI PORTER, <LB>Secundis, SAMUELIS JOHNSON; <LB>Qui multum amatam, diuque defletam <LB>Hoc lapide contexit. <LB>Obiit Londini, men&s;e Mart. <LB>A.D.

<P>I have been informed that, in his early youth, he entertained a romantic pa&s;&s;ion, excited po&s;&s;ibly by reading the poets, for a young woman of a family and in circum&s;tances far above him; but proofs are wanting that John&s;on was, at any period of his life, &s;u&s;ceptible of amorous emotions. In his inter|cour&s;e with the world, he had become known to many of the female &s;ex, who &s;ought his conver&s;a|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Po&s;terity will wonder to be told, that a celebrated courtezan, Kitty Fi&s;her, was of the number, and that, po&s;&s;ibly having heard of the attempt of La&iuml;s on Demo&s;thenes, &s;he once left her card at his hou&s;e.</NOTE>, but it was never heard that he entertain|ed a pa&s;&s;ion for any one, or was in any other &s;en&s;e a lover, than as he was the author of amo|rous

ver&s;es. If ever he was in danger of becom|ing one in reality, it was of a young woman whom he u&s;ed to call Molly A&s;ton, of who&s;e wit, and of the delight he enjoyed in conver&s;ing with her, he would &s;peak with rapture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She was a violent whig, and, by con&s;equence, a declaimer for liberty, a particular in her character that induced John&s;on to com|pliment her in the following elegant epigram:<Q><L>Liber ut e&s;&s;e velim, &s;ua&s;i&s;ti pulchra Maria,</L>

<P>The melancholy, which &s;eized John&s;on on the death of his wife, was not, in degree, &s;uch as u&s;ually follows the deprivation of near relations and friends: it was of the blacke&s;t and deepe&s;t kind. That affection, which could excite in the mind of Milton the plea&s;|ing images de&s;cribed in his &s;onnet on his decea&s;ed wife,
<Q><L> Methought I &s;aw my late e&s;pou&s;ed &s;aint,</L></Q>
wrought no &s;uch effect on that of John&s;on: the appa|rition of his departed wife was altogether of the terrific kind, and hardly afforded him a hope that &s;he was in a &s;tate of happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="322">
That the&s;e gloomy conceptions were in part owing to the books he had been accu&s;tomed to read, I have little doubt. Sundry pa&s;&s;ages occur in his writings, which induce a &s;u&s;picion, that his notions of the &s;tate of departed &s;pirits were &s;uch as are now deemed &s;uper|&s;titious; and I will not attempt to vindicate him from the charge of believing &s;ome of the many rela|tions extant, that go to prove an intercour&s;e between them and the inhabitants of this earth. The&s;e, as they were fy&s;tematical, and &s;uch as he was able to defend by arguments the mo&s;t &s;pecious, I can no better ac|count for, than by a &s;uppo&s;ition, that in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies he had been a dabbler in demonology, by which I mean, not the writings of tho&s;e vulgar authors who relate the intrigues and midnight banquets of witches with infernal &s;pirits, or that teach the difference between black and white witches, and a&s;&s;ert the power of them and their agents to harm us, but from tho&s;e more authentic writers, namely, Mede, and others, who&s;e proofs, that the doctrine of demons made a part of the gentile theology, have induced an opinion that in the&s;e later times departed &s;pirits have &s;uch an exi&s;tence as the intercour&s;e above-mentioned, &s;eems to imply.</P>
<P>Not to dwell longer on &s;o painful a &s;ubject, I will di&s;mi&s;s the&s;e reflections with an ob&s;ervation, that by the unhappine&s;s of his bodily con&s;titution, and the defect of his organs of &s;en&s;e, he was rendered un&s;u&s;|ceptible of almo&s;t all tho&s;e delights which we term plea&s;ures of the imagination, and which help to &s;oothe the mind under affliction; and this melancholy truth I &s;hall attempt to illu&s;trate by the following ob&s;er|vations:</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="323">
With re&s;pect to &s;ight, it mu&s;t be noted, that he was of that cla&s;s of men, who, from a defect in the vi&s;ual organs, are termed myops, or near-&s;ighted per&s;ons; and farther, that di&s;ea&s;e had deprived him of the u&s;e of one eye, the con&s;equence whereof was, that in lieu of tho&s;e various delightful pro&s;pects which the face of nature affords, the beautiful and the grand, that multiply ideas and admini&s;ter delight, as well in the reflection as the immediate enjoyment of them, his mind was pre&s;ented with an univer&s;al blank. Nor was his misfortune le&s;s, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e objects wherein beauty, &s;ymmetry, and harmony of parts and proportions are re&s;ident: to him a &s;tatue was an un&s;hapen ma&s;s, and a &s;umptuous edifice a quarry of &s;tone. Of the beauties of painting, notwith&s;tand|ing the many eulogiums on that art which, after the commencement of his friend&s;hip with Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, he in&s;erted in his writings, he had not the lea&s;t conception; and this leads me to mention a fact to the purpo&s;e, which I well remember. One evening, at the club, I came in with a &s;mall roll of prints, which, in the afternoon, I had picked up: I think they were land&s;capes of Perelle, and laying it down with my hat, John&s;on's curio&s;ity prompted him to take it up and unroll it: he viewed the prints &s;everally with great attention, and a&s;ked me what &s;ort of plea|&s;ure &s;uch things could afford me; I told him, that as repre&s;entations of nature, containing an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;uch particulars as render rural &s;cenes delightful, they pre&s;ented to my mind the objects them&s;elves, and that my imagination reali&s;ed the pro&s;pect before me; he &s;aid, that was more than his would do, for that
<PB N="319" REF="324">
in his whole life he was never capable of di&s;cerning the lea&s;t re&s;emblance of any kind between a picture and the &s;ubject it was intended to repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>To the delights of mu&s;ic, he was equally in&s;en&s;ible: neither voice nor in&s;trument, nor the harmony of con|cordant &s;ounds, had power over his affections, or even to engage his attention. Of mu&s;ic in general, he has been heard to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">'it excites in my mind no ideas, and hinders me from contemplating my own;'</Q> and of a fine &s;inger, or in&s;trumental performer, that <Q REND="inline">'he had the merit of a Canary-bird<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;ometimes thought that mu&s;ic was po&s;itive pain to him. Upon his once hearing a celebrated performer go through a hard compo&s;ition, and hearing it remarked that it was very difficult, John&s;on &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I would it had been impo&s;&s;ible.'</Q> As a &s;cience of which he was ignorant he contemned it. In the early part of my life I had collected &s;ome memoirs of Abbate Steffani, Mr. Handel's predece&s;&s;or at the court of Hanover, and the compo&s;er of tho&s;e fine duets that go under his name. with a view to print them, as pre&s;ents to &s;ome mu&s;ical friends: I &s;ubmitted the manu&s;cript to John&s;on's peru&s;al, and he returned it with corrections that turned to ridi|cule all I had &s;aid of him and his works.</NOTE>.'</Q> Not that his hearing was &s;o defective as to account for this in&s;en&s;ibility, but he laboured under the misfortune which he has noted in his life of Barretier, and is common to more per&s;ons than in this mu&s;ical age are willing to confe&s;s it, of wanting that additional &s;en&s;e or faculty, which renders mu&s;ic grateful to the human ear.</P>
<P>From this &s;tate of his mental and bodily con&s;titution, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be inferred, that his comforts were very few, and that his mind had no counterpoi&s;e again&s;t tho&s;e evils of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;orrow, and want, which, at different periods of his life he laboured under, and in &s;ome of his writings pathetically laments. Of this misfortune him&s;elf was &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="320" REF="325">
and the frequent reflection thereon wrought in him a per&s;ua&s;ion, that the evils of human life preponde|rated again&s;t the enjoyments of it; and this opinion he would frequently enforce by an ob&s;ervation on the general u&s;e of narcotics in all parts of the world, as, in the ea&s;t, and &s;outhern countries, opium; in the we&s;t, and northern, &s;pirituous liquors and tobacco<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He has been heard to remark, that &s;ince the di&s;u&s;e of &s;moaking among the better &s;ort of people, &s;uicide has been more frequent in this country than before.</NOTE>; and into this principle he re&s;olved mo&s;t of the temp|tations to ebriety. To the u&s;e of the former of the&s;e, him&s;elf had a &s;trong propen&s;ity, which increa&s;ed as he advanced in years: his fir&s;t inducement to it was, relief again&s;t watchfulne&s;s, but when it became habi|tual, it was the means of po&s;itive plea&s;ure, and as &s;uch, was re&s;orted to by him whenever any depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits made it nece&s;&s;ary. His practice was, to take it in &s;ub&s;tance, that is to &s;ay, half a grain levigated with a &s;poon again&s;t the &s;ide of a cup half full of &s;ome liquid, which, as a vehicle, carried it down.</P>
<P>With &s;o few re&s;ources of delight, it is not to be wondered at, if after the lo&s;s of his wife, his melan|choly was hardly &s;upportable. Company and conver|&s;ation were the only reliefs to it, and when the&s;e failed him he was mi&s;erable. At the club in Ivy lane, our u&s;ual hour of departure was eleven, and when that approached he was frequently tempted to wander the &s;treets, and join in the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e mi&s;er|able females who were there to be met with. Of the&s;e he was very inqui&s;itive as to their cour&s;e of life, the hi&s;tory of their &s;eduction, and the chances of re|claiming them. The fir&s;t que&s;tion he generally
<PB N="321" REF="326">
a&s;ked was, if they could read. Of one who was very hand&s;ome, he a&s;ked, for what &s;he thought God had given her &s;o much beauty: &s;he an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'To plea&s;e gentlemen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is too well atte&s;ted for me to omit it; but it leaves it a que&s;tion, how, with the defect of &s;ight under which he laboured, he was capable of di&s;cerning beauty. He might po&s;&s;ibly think it an indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite for her profe&s;&s;ion, and therefore conclude that &s;he had it.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which, at this period of his life, &s;urrounded him, he found both inclination and the means to be helpful to others. His wife, a &s;hort time before her death, had con&s;igned to his care a friend of her own &s;ex, a per&s;on of very extraor|dinary endowments, whom, for a benevolent purpo&s;e that will be &s;hortly mentioned, John&s;on had invited to a re&s;idence in his hou&s;e: This was Mrs. Anna Williams, who&s;e hi&s;tory is as follows:</P>
<P>Her father, Zachariah Williams, was a &s;urgeon and phy&s;ician in South Wales, a man of parts and great ingenuity: he had addicted him&s;elf to mathematical &s;tudies, and having, by a kind of intuitive penetra|tion, di&s;covered, that the variations of the magnetic needle were equal at equal di&s;tances ea&s;t and we&s;t; he entertained a &s;anguine hope, that he had attained the means of a&s;certaining the longitude. As London was the place where he thought he &s;hould be&s;t avail him&s;elf of his di&s;covery, and al&s;o turn it to the im|provement of his fortunes, he, in the year 1730, with an apparatus of mathematical and nautical in&s;tru|ments of his own invention, left his habitation and bu&s;ine&s;s, and, together with his daughter, &s;ettled in the metropolis. His fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was, to lay before the commi&s;&s;ioners of the longitude the fruits of his
<PB N="322" REF="327">
&s;tudies; but, upon a due examination, they all proved abortive: no proportion whatever of the reward could be a&s;&s;igned him as his due; but, as a kind of recom|pence for his di&s;appointment, means were found to procure him a maintenance in the Charterhou&s;e, and accordingly he was admitted into that a&s;ylum of age and poverty. With all his ingenuity and &s;cien|tific wi&s;dom, which I have heard his daughter, with an excu&s;able partiality, magnify beyond credibility, he mu&s;t have been defective in worldly prudence; for, either by the infraction of oeconomical regulations, or &s;ome other mi&s;conduct re&s;pecting the endowment from which he derived his &s;upport, he rendered him|&s;elf at fir&s;t obnoxious to cen&s;ure from the governors, and in the end was obliged to forego all the benefits of it, to become an outca&s;t, and, at the age of &s;eventy|five, to &s;uffer &s;hipwreck in the wide ocean of the world. In a narrative, publi&s;hed in 1749, he com|plains of his expul&s;ion as an act of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>What became of him afterwards I could never learn, &s;ave that in the year 1755, he publi&s;hed in Italian and Engli&s;h a book intitled, <Q REND="inline">'An account of an attempt to a&s;certain the longitude at &s;ea, by an exact theory of the magnetical needle,'</Q> written, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, by John&s;on, and tran&s;lated by Mr. Baretti. Of his daughter, I am able to &s;ay more, having known her a long time. About ten years after her arrival with her father in London, &s;he was alarmed by the appearance of a cataract on both her eyes, which continued to increa&s;e till it totally de|prived her of her &s;ight. Before this calamity befel her, &s;he, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her father, had ac|quired a knowledge of the French and Italian
<PB N="323" REF="328">
languages, and had made great improvements in literature, which, together with the exerci&s;e of her needle, at which &s;he was very dextrous, as well after the lo&s;s of her &s;ight as before, contributed to &s;upport her under her affliction, till a time when it was thought by her friends, that relief might be obtained from the hand of an operating &s;urgeon. At the reque&s;t of Dr. John&s;on, I went with her to a friend of mine, Mr. Samuel Sharp, &s;enior &s;urgeon of Guy's ho&s;pital, who before had given me to under&s;tand, that he would couch her gratis if the cataract was ripe, but upon making the experiment it was found otherwi&s;e, and that the cry&s;talline humour was not &s;ufficiently in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated for the needle to take effect. She had been almo&s;t a con&s;tant companion of Mrs. John&s;on for &s;ome time before her decea&s;e, but had never re&s;ided in the hou&s;e: afterwards, for the convenience of performing the intended operation, John&s;on took her home, and upon the failure of that, kept her as the partner of his dwelling till he removed into chambers, fir&s;t in Gray's inn, and next in the Temple. Afterward, in 1766, upon his taking a hou&s;e in John&s;on's court in Fleet &s;treet, he invited her thither, and in that, and his la&s;t hou&s;e in Bolt court, &s;he &s;ucce&s;&s;ively dwelt for the remainder of her life.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of her &s;ight made but a &s;mall abatement of her chearfulne&s;s, and was &s;carce any interruption of her &s;tudies. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two female friends, &s;he tran&s;lated from the French of Pere La Bletrie, the life of the emperer Julian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See it mentioned in Nichols's Life of Bowyer.</NOTE>. In 1755, Mr. Garrick, ever di&s;po&s;ed to help the afflicted, in|dulged
<PB N="324" REF="329">
her with a benefit-play that produced her two hundred pounds; and in 1766, &s;he publi&s;hed by &s;ub&s;cription a quarto volume of mi&s;cellanies in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, and thereby increa&s;ed her little fund to three hundred pounds, which, being prudently inve&s;t|ed, yielded an income, that under &s;uch protection as &s;he experienced from Dr. John&s;on, was &s;ufficient for her &s;upport.</P>
<P>She was a woman of an enlightened under&s;tanding; plain, as the women call it, in her per&s;on, and ea&s;ily provoked to anger, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome excellent moral qualities, among which no one was more con&s;picuous, than her de&s;ire to promote the welfare and happine&s;s of others, and of this &s;he gave a &s;ignal proof, by her &s;olicitude in favour of an in&s;titution for the maintenance and education of poor de&s;erted females in the pari&s;h of St. Sepulchre, London, &s;upported by the voluntary contributions of ladies, and, as the foundation-&s;tone of a fund for its future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;he bequeathed to it the whole of that little, which, by the means above-mentioned, &s;he had been able to accumulate. To the endow|ments and qualities here a&s;cribed to her, may be added, a larger &s;hare of experimental prudence than is the lot of mo&s;t of her &s;ex. John&s;on, in many exi|gences, found her an able coun&s;ellor, and &s;eldom &s;hewed his wi&s;dom more than when he hearkened to her advice. In return, &s;he received from his conver|&s;ation the advantages of religious and moral improve|ment, which &s;he cultivated &s;o, as in a great mea&s;ure to &s;mooth the con&s;titutional a&s;perity of her temper. When the&s;e particulars are known, this intimacy, which began with compa&s;&s;ion, and terminated in a
<PB N="325" REF="330">
friend&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted till death di&s;&s;olved it, will be ea&s;ily accounted for.</P>
<P>John&s;on had but for a &s;hort time enjoyed the relief from &s;olitude and melancholy reflection which this friendly attachment afforded him, before he expe|rienced that affliction, which, in the cour&s;e of nature, is the concomitant of longevity, in the lo&s;s of his friend Cave, who fini&s;hed a u&s;eful and well-&s;pent life in the month of January, 1754. It might &s;eem that between men &s;o different in their endowments and tempers as John&s;on and Cave were, little of true friend&s;hip could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but the contrary was the ca&s;e: Cave, though a man of a &s;aturnine di&s;po&s;ition, had a &s;agacity which had long been exerci&s;ed in the di&s;crimination of men, in &s;earching into the rece&s;&s;es of their minds, and finding out what they were fit for; and a liberality of &s;entiment and action, which, under proper re&s;trictions, inclined him not only to encourage genius and merit, but to e&s;teem and even to venerate the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e qualities as often as he met with them: it cannot, therefore, be &s;uppo&s;ed, but that he entertained a high regard for &s;uch a man as John&s;on, and, having had a long experience of his abilities and integrity, that he had improved this di&s;|po&s;ition into friend&s;hip. John&s;on, on his part, &s;ought for other qualities in tho&s;e with whom he meant to form connections: had he determined to make only tho&s;e his friends who&s;e endowments were equal to his own, his life would have been that of a Carthu&s;ian; he was therefore more &s;olicitous to contract friend|&s;hips with men of probity and integrity, and endued with good moral qualities, than with tho&s;e who&s;e in|tellectual powers, or literary attainments, were the
<PB N="326" REF="331">
mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of their character; and of the former, Cave had a &s;hare, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify his choice.</P>
<P>On this mutual regard for each other, as on a &s;olid ba&s;is, re&s;ted the friend&s;hip between John&s;on and Cave. It was therefore with a degree of &s;orrow, proportioned to his feelings towards his friends, which were ever tender, that John&s;on reflected on the lo&s;s he had to &s;u&s;tain, and became the narrator of the mo&s;t important incidents of his life. In the account which he has given of his death, it will be readily believed, that what he has related re&s;pecting the con&s;tancy of his friend&s;hip, is true, and that when, as the la&s;t act of rea&s;on, he fondly pre&s;&s;ed the hand that was afterwards employed in recording his memory, his affection was &s;incere.</P>
<P>By &s;ome papers now in my hands it &s;eems that, not|with&s;tanding John&s;on was paid for writing the Ramb|ler, he had a remaining intere&s;t in the copy-right of that paper, which about this time he &s;old. The pro|duce thereof, the pay he was receiving for his papers in the Adventurer, and the fruits of his other literary labours, had now exalted him to &s;uch a &s;tate of com|parative affluence, as, in his judgment, made a man|&s;ervant nece&s;&s;ary. Soon after the decea&s;e of Mrs. John&s;on, the father of Dr. Bathur&s;t arrived in England from Jamaica, and brought with him a negro-&s;ervant, a native of that i&s;land, whom he cau&s;ed to be baptized and named Francis Barber, and &s;ent for in&s;truction to Burton upon Tees in York&s;hire: upon the decea&s;e of captain Bathur&s;t, for &s;o he was called, Francis went to live with his &s;on, who willingly parted with him to John&s;on. The u&s;es for which he was intended
<PB N="327" REF="332">
to &s;erve this his la&s;t ma&s;ter were not very apparent, for Diogenes him&s;elf never wanted a &s;ervant le&s;s than he &s;eemed to do: the great bu&s;hy wig, which through|out his life he affected to wear, by that clo&s;ene&s;s of texture which it had contracted and been &s;uffered to retain, was ever nearly as impenetrable by a comb as a quick&s;et hedge; and little of the du&s;t that had once &s;ettled on his outer garments was ever known to have been di&s;turbed by the bru&s;h. In &s;hort, his garb and the whole of his external appearance was, not to &s;ay negligent, but &s;lovenly, and even &s;qualid; to all which, and the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of it, he appeared as in&s;en&s;ible as if he had been nurtured at the cape of Good Hope: he &s;aw that, notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e offen&s;ive peculiarities in his manners, his conver&s;ation had great attractions, and perhaps he might e&s;timate the &s;trength of the one by the degree of the other, and thence derive that apathy, which, after all, might have its foundation in pride, and afforded him occa&s;ion for a triumph over all the &s;olicitudes re&s;pecting dre&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That he was an habitual &s;loven his be&s;t friends cannot deny. When I fir&s;t knew him, he was little le&s;s &s;o than Magliabechi, of whom it is &s;aid, that at meals he made a book &s;erve him for a plate, and that he very &s;eldom changed his linen, or wa&s;hed him|&s;elf. It is &s;aid of other &s;cholars and men eminent in literature, of Leibnitz, Poiret, St. Evremond, and Pope, that they were alike uncleanly. John&s;on, as his acquaintance with per&s;ons of condition became more enlarged, and his invitations to dinner-parties in|crea&s;ed, corrected, in &s;ome degree, this failing, but could never be &s;aid to be neatly dre&s;&s;ed, or indeed clean; he affected to wear cloaths of the darke&s;t and dirtie&s;t colours, and, in all weathers, black &s;tockings. His wig never &s;at even on his head, as may be ob&s;erved in all the pictures of him, the rea&s;on whereof was, that he had a twi&s;t in his &s;houlders, and that the motion of his head, as &s;oon as he put it on, dragged it awry.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="333">
Of this negro-&s;ervant much has been &s;aid, by tho&s;e who knew little or nothing of him, in ju&s;tification of that partiality which John&s;on &s;hewed for him, and his neglect of his own nece&s;&s;itous relations. The follow|ing particulars are all that are worth relating of him: He &s;tayed with John&s;on about five years, that is to &s;ay, till 1758, and then left him, but at the end of two years returned, and was taken again into his &s;ervice. His fir&s;t ma&s;ter had, in great humanity, made him a Chri&s;tian; and his la&s;t, for no a&s;&s;ignable rea&s;on, nav, rather in de&s;pight of nature, and to unfit him for being u&s;eful according to his capacity, deter|mined to make him a &s;cholar.</P>
<P>He placed him at a &s;chool at Bi&s;hop-Stortford, and kept him there five years; and, as Mrs. Williams was u&s;ed to &s;ay, who would frequently reproach him with his indi&s;cretion in this in&s;tance, expended three hun|dred pounds in an endeavour to have him taught Latin and Greek<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Mrs. Wiliams, who, with a view to the intere&s;t of her friend, was very attentive to the conduct of this his favourite, when &s;he took occa&s;ion to complain to his ma&s;ter of his mi&s;behaviour, would do it in &s;uch terms as the&s;e: <Q REND="inline">'This is your &s;cbolar! your philo&s;opher! upon whom you have &s;pent &s;o many hundred pounds.'</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The propo&s;al for the dictionary, and other of his writings, had exhibited John&s;on to view in the cha|racter of a poet and a philologi&s;t: to his moral quali|ties, and his concern for the intere&s;ts of religion and virtue, the world were for &s;ome time &s;trangers; but no &s;ooner were the&s;e manife&s;ted by the publication of the Rambler and the Adventurer, than he was looked up to as a ma&s;ter of human life, a practical Chri&s;tian,

and a divine; his acquaintance was &s;ought by per|&s;ons of the fir&s;t eminence in literature, and his hou&s;e, in re&s;pect of the conver&s;ations there, became an aca|demy. One per&s;on, in particular, who &s;eems, for a great part of his life, to have affected the character of a patron of learned and ingenious men, in a letter which I have &s;een, made him a tender of his friend&s;hip in terms to this effect:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'That having peru&s;ed many of his writings, and thence conceived a high opinion of his learning, his genius, and moral qualities, if Mr. John&s;on was inclined to enlarge the circle of his ac|quaintance, he [the letter-writer] &s;hould be glad to be admitted into the number of his friends, and to receive a vi&s;it from him.'&mdash;</Q>This per&s;on was Mr. Dodington, afterwards lord Melcombe, the value and honour of who&s;e patronage, to &s;peak the truth, may in &s;ome degree be e&s;timated by his diary lately pub|li&s;hed, but better by the account which I mean here to give of his favourites and dependents, with &s;ome of whom I was per&s;onally acquainted. How John&s;on received this invitation I know not: as it was con|veyed in very hand&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions, it required &s;ome apology for declining it, and I cannot but think he framed one.</P>
<P>One of the earlie&s;t of lord Melcombe's clients was Dr. Edward Young, the author of the Satires, of the Night-thoughts, and of the Revenge, a tragedy; a man who, by a &s;trange fatality, could never attain to any of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions in his profe&s;&s;ion, which are generally under&s;tood to be the rewards of learning and piety, and mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have failed by the ardour with which he &s;olicited, and the &s;ervile adulation which he practi&s;ed to come at them, of which latter di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="330" REF="335">
he has given &s;uch in&s;tances in the dedications of his fatires to the &s;everal per&s;ons of high rank, to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed, as al&s;o, in the exordium to each of the Night-thoughts at their fir&s;t coming abroad, for in the later edition they are omitted, as are a di&s;|grace to manhood, and mu&s;t have put the vaine&s;t of his patrons to the blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Mr. James Ralph was another of his dependents, of whom, as a pretender to genius, much may be learned from the Dunciad. He was the tool of that party, of which his lord&s;hip laboured in vain to become the leader; and, to &s;erve its purpo&s;es, by inflaming the minds of the people, wrote a weekly paper called the Remembrancer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whoever is de&s;irous of being acquainted with the intrigues of contending factions. and the methods of exciting popular di&s;content, may receive ample information from the peru&s;al of lord Melcombe's Diary, and will there find, that to effect this purpo&s;e, and furni&s;h the unthinking multitude with topics for clamour, the publication of a political news-paper was by him and his party thought expedi|ent. I have been credibly informed, that dean Swift would fre|quently boa&s;t, that with liberty allowed him for the free exerci&s;e of his pen or the mea&s;ures of government, he was able to write down any mini&s;try whatever.</NOTE>. For this and other good deeds of the like kind, he is, in the diary above-mentioned, held forth as an exemplar to all writers of his profe&s;&s;ion, and dignified with the character of an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>Another of the&s;e men of genius, who enjoyed the favour of Mr. Dodington, was Mr. Paul Whitehead, who&s;e love for his country, and knowledge of its in|tere&s;ts, became fir&s;t known by a &s;atire of his writing entitled, <Q REND="inline">'The State Dunces,'</Q> which, as he was a patriot, and, as all patriots pretend to be, a firm friend to what they call the con&s;titution, bears this candid motto:<Q><PB N="331" REF="336"><L>I from my &s;oul &s;incerely hate</L>
<L>Both kings and mini&s;ters of &s;tate.</L></Q> He al&s;o wrote <Q REND="inline">'Manners,'</Q> a &s;atire; a libel of a more general tendency, as including in it many invectives again&s;t &s;ome of the nobility, and mo&s;t eminent of the dignified clergy.</P>
<P>Of this man, who many years was my neighbour in the country, I know much to blame and &s;omewhat to commend: he may be &s;uppo&s;ed, in his younger days, to have imbibed that malevolence again&s;t the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which was the &s;entiment of many at the beginning of this century, and by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, to which the peru&s;al of &s;uch papers as the Craft&s;man, Common-&s;en&s;e, and other publications of the time, and, mo&s;t of all, the conver&s;ation of &s;uch per&s;ons as he cho&s;e for his a&s;&s;ociates, might probably lead him, to have engendered in his mind a hatred of all who&s;e offices in the &s;tate had made the &s;upport of govern|ment their duty, and a re&s;olution to acquie&s;ce in that fallacious di&s;crimination of two cla&s;&s;es of men, the one whereof was in, and the other out of power, into the court and country parties.</P>
<P>It is not much to the credit of the latter of the&s;e two, that &s;ome of the writers on the fide of it were &s;uch avowed enemies to religion, as might beget, in tho&s;e acquainted with their characters, a &s;u&s;picion that, as in the language of politics, there is an alliance between church and &s;tate, a &s;imilar relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between infidelity and patrioti&s;m, proofs whereof have not been wanting in the&s;e our late times; for it is evi|dent, that as the injunctions to obedience imply reli|gion, the want thereof, <HI>quoad</HI> the per&s;on who is to pay it, vacates the obligation, and leaves him at liberty to form an alliance with the other &s;ide.</P>

And that &s;ome of the writers on the &s;ide of the country party, as it was called, particularly in the Craft&s;man, were men of this character, is certain. Amhur&s;t, the o&s;ten&s;ible author of the paper, was expelled his univer&s;ity, and was, moreover, a friend and a&s;&s;ociate of Strutt, an attorney of the temple, who wrote &s;everal letters or e&s;&s;ays in his paper, and a treati&s;e with &s;ome &s;uch title as, <Q REND="inline">'A philo&s;ophical enquiry into the nature of human liberty,'</Q> wherein the freedom of the human will is denied, and the actions of men are made to re&s;ult from an irre&s;i&s;tible nece&s;&s;ity. This tract I have heard Whitehead commend and a&s;&s;ert that it contained a full refutation of all that Dr. Clarke, in his controver&s;y with Leibnitz, has advanced in favour of the contrary opinion, and at the &s;ame time &s;peak of the author as one whom the greatne&s;s of his parts, had he lived, would have rai&s;ed to the dignity of lord|chancellor; but of who&s;e moral and religious prin|ciples a judgment may be formed, by means of the following letter, which, for the athei&s;tical expre&s;&s;ions contained therein, was the ground for the expul&s;ion of the writer of it from the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. I forbear remarking on this bla&s;phemous epi&s;tle, farther than, that the regret I have often felt in the peru&s;al of it has been not a little increa&s;ed by the figure that my friend Paul makes in it, and the intimacy between him and Strutt which it di&s;clo&s;es.</P>

<P>The political principles of Whitehead recom|mended him to Mr. Dodington, who&s;e o&s;tentation was gratified, and his ambitious views in a way to be advanced, by a connection with a man who had abilities to write, and the boldne&s;s to publi&s;h whatever might &s;erve the purpo&s;es of a party, and who&s;e zeal for its intere&s;ts was &s;ubject to any direction.
<PB N="335" REF="340">
Dodington admired the keenne&s;s of Whitehead's wit, and the &s;pirit of his &s;atires, and his commendations were repaid by the latter, with encomiums on his patron's political wi&s;dom and qualifications for &s;tate employments, which, as they &s;eemed to have no foun|dation in principle, Paul was as little able to inve&s;ti|gate as to delineate the path of a comet. In his con|ver&s;ation there was little to prai&s;e: it was de&s;ultory, vociferous, and profane. He had contracted a habit of &s;wearing in his younger years, which he retained to his late&s;t. At Twickenham he never frequented divine &s;ervice; and when pre&s;&s;ed by one of his friends there to &s;hew him&s;elf at church, excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying he was not &s;ettled. He was vi&s;ited by very few of the inhabitants of the village; but his hou&s;e was open to all his London friends, among whom were Mr. Hogarth, I&s;aac Ware the architect, George Lambert, and Hayman the painters, and Mr. Havard the player, men who had &s;pent all their lives in and about Covent-garden, and looked upon it as the &s;chool of manners, and an epitome of the world.</P>
<P>Paul was endowed with a great portion of wit, but it was altogether of the &s;atyrical kind, and &s;erved to little purpo&s;e, other than to expo&s;e to ridicule or contempt the objects to which it was directed. In concert with one Carey a &s;urgeon, he planned and exhibited a proce&s;&s;ion along the Strand, of per&s;ons on foot and on hor&s;eback, dre&s;&s;ed for the occa&s;ion, car|rying mock en&s;igns, and the &s;ymbols of free-ma&s;onry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A print of the proce&s;&s;ion, de&s;igned and engraved by Benoi&s;t, was publi&s;hed about the time.</NOTE>; the de&s;ign of which was, to expo&s;e to laughter the in&s;ignia and ceremonies of that my&s;terious in&s;titution,
<PB N="336" REF="341">
and it was not till thirty years after, that the fraternity recovered the di&s;grace which &s;o ludicrous a repre&s;en|tation had brought on it.</P>
<P>After enumerating the&s;e his exceptionable qualities, it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay of Whitehead, that he was by nature a friendly and kind-hearted man, well acquaint|ed with vulgar manners and the town, but little &s;killed in the knowledge of the world, and, by con&s;equence, little able to re&s;i&s;t the arts of de&s;igning men; and of this defect he gave a melancholy proof in &s;ubmitting to be engaged for Fleetwood, the patentee of Drury|lane theatre, in a bond for 3000l; for failure in the payment whereof he &s;u&s;tained impri&s;onment in the Fleet for &s;ome of the be&s;t years of his life. He had married a woman of a good family and fortune, whom, though homely in her per&s;on, and little better than an idiot, he treated not only with humanity, but with tenderne&s;s, hiding, as well as he was able, tho&s;e defects in her under&s;tanding, which are oftener the &s;ubjects of ridicule than of compa&s;&s;ion. After his enlargement, &s;ome money fell to him, with which, and the profits of the place of deputy-trea&s;urer of the chamber, which he held for &s;ome time under lord Le De&s;pen&s;er, he pur|cha&s;ed a cottage on Twickenham common, and from a de&s;ign and under the in&s;pection of his friend I&s;aac Ware, at a &s;mall expence improved it into an elegant dwelling. Here he manife&s;ted the goodne&s;s of his nature in the exerci&s;e of kind offices, in heal|ing breaches, and compo&s;ing differences between his poor neighbours; and living to &s;ee, as he did at the commencement of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's reign, power lodged in the hands of &s;uch as he thought friends of their country, and above all temptations to abu&s;e it,
<PB N="337" REF="342">
he abandoned his factious principles, and became a loyal &s;ubject. In a grateful &s;en&s;e of his obligations to lord Le De&s;pen&s;er, he directed, that after his decea&s;e, his heart, inclo&s;ed in a ve&s;&s;el for the purpo&s;e, &s;hould be pre&s;ented to him, which being done, his lord&s;hip cau&s;ed it to be depo&s;ited in his church of We&s;t Wycomb.</P>
<P>Dr. Thomp&s;on was one of the many phy&s;icians who, in this country, have enjoyed a &s;hort-lived repu|tation, acquired by methods unknown to any but them&s;elves. The earlie&s;t of his practice was among men of eminence, Mr. Pope and others, who, de|ceived by his confidence and a certain contempt with which he ever &s;poke of the re&s;t of his profe&s;&s;ion as being bigotted to theories and &s;y&s;tems, looked upon him as a man of an inventive genius, who had reduced the art of healing to an epitome. The fact was, that, affecting to be a free-thinker in his faculty, he &s;et at nought the di&s;coveries and improve|ments of others, and treated with ridicule that practice which he did not under&s;tand. He was an everla&s;ting prater on politics and critici&s;m, and &s;aw &s;o deep into the councils of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, that he could a&s;&s;ign the motives of all his actions, during the la&s;t war in which he was engaged. At taverns, in coffee-hou&s;es, at the cyder-cellar in Maiden lane, he was frequently to be found holding forth on the&s;e &s;ubjects without interruption, in a tone of voice which Mr. Garrick would &s;ay was like the buz of an humble|bee in a hall-window. This man enjoyed the favour of lord Melcombe, and, what was of greater benefit to him, an apartment in his hou&s;e, with a protection from arre&s;ts, founded on the privilege which the law grants,
<PB N="338" REF="343">
not only to peers, but to the lowe&s;t of their menial &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Quin once told me a &s;tory of this man, which I will relate in as few words as I am able.&mdash;Quin walking up and down, one Sunday evening, in the Bedford coffee-hou&s;e, ob&s;erved a man in a dark corner lean|ing his forehead on the table, and every now and then &s;ending forth a &s;igh, that &s;eemed to come from his heart. Moved with compa&s;&s;ion, he went up to him, and enquiring the cau&s;e of his grief, was told by him, that his name was Thomp&s;on, that he was a phy&s;ician ri&s;ing into practice, but that, for want of fifty pounds, his chariot could not go abroad the next day, and his patients mu&s;t remain unvi&s;ited. Quin bid him be comforted, and, &s;tepping to his lodgings in Bedford &s;treet, returned with a bank-note for that &s;um, which he told Thomp&s;on he would not expect till he was able to repay it: the other an&s;wered, that a month was as long as he wi&s;hed to retain it; but Quin told him that he could &s;pare it for three, or even &s;ix months, and took his leave. Six months elap&s;ed, and no apology made for non-payment of the money. Quin, in a civil letter, reminded Thomp&s;on of the terms on which it was lent, but receiving no an&s;wer to that and others that he wrote, he was obliged to &s;end him one by his attorney, which produced a noti|fication from the duke of Newca&s;tle's office, that the name of Dr. Thomp&s;on was there entered as of a per|&s;on privileged from arre&s;ts, and that it would be at Mr. Quin's peril if he proceeded to violate that pro|tection which he claimed, and the law granted him. Being thus prohibited from the re&s;traint of his per&s;on, Quin was obliged to wait the re-payment of his money,
<PB N="339" REF="344">
which, at the expiration of &s;ome months, he received, but without the lea&s;t acknowledgment of his kindne&s;s in lending it.</P>
<P>This was a man whom Whitehead, in the &s;implicity of his heart, held in &s;uch e&s;timation, that I have &s;een him, for hours together, li&s;tening, with his lips unclo&s;|ed, to the torrents of non&s;en&s;e he was pouring forth: he addre&s;&s;ed an epi&s;tle to him, wherein he celebrates his medical abilities and moral qualities, and makes the number of per&s;ons daily re&s;tored by him to health, equal to tho&s;e who were &s;ent to their long|homes by Wilmot and the other eminent phy&s;icians his rivals and contemporaries.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the advantages with which he &s;et out, and the extravagant encomiums of Fielding and others, of him and his practice, Thomp&s;on &s;unk into contempt and ob&s;curity. Like Paracel&s;us, he per|formed a few cures, that neither him&s;elf nor any others were ever able to account for; and in a ca&s;e of &s;urgery he was once known, by dint of mere ob|&s;tinacy, to have &s;aved a limb. A &s;on of a friend of mine, an officer, being in the &s;ervice in Ger|many, and at the head of a &s;kirmi&s;hing-party on hor&s;eback, received a wound with a &s;abre that &s;epa|rated the tendons and ligaments which connect the foot with the leg: at a con&s;ultation on his ca&s;e of two of the mo&s;t eminent &s;urgeons, Thomp&s;on, as being the family phy&s;ician, was called to a&s;&s;i&s;t, who, in oppo&s;ition to their opinion that an amputation was inevitable, &s;wore that his friend &s;hould not undergo it: the operation was deferred, and by the help of the Mal|vern waters, the patient recovered &s;uch an u&s;e of the whole limb as enabled him to walk with &s;carce any variation of his accu&s;tomed gait.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="345">
Had John&s;on accepted of Mr. Dodington's invita|tion, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that he would have been much plea&s;ed with the company of the&s;e and &s;uch other per&s;ons as it was likely to introduce him to. His declining it &s;eems, therefore, an act of great prudence, and indeed he was exempted from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking connections; for many per&s;ons were of Dod|ington's mind, and were de&s;irous of adding him to the number of their friends. Invitations to dine with &s;uch of tho&s;e as he liked, he &s;o &s;eldom declined, that, to a friend of his, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I never but once, upon a re&s;olution to employ my&s;elf in &s;tudy, balked an in|vitation out to dinner, and then I &s;tayed at home and did nothing.'</Q> Little, however, did that laxity of temper, which this confe&s;&s;ion &s;eems to imply, retard the progre&s;s of the great work in which he was em|ployed: the conclu&s;ion, and al&s;o the perfection of his dictionary, were objects from which his attention was not to be diverted: the avocations he gave way to were &s;uch only as, when complied with, &s;erved to invigorate his mind to the performance of his engage|ments to his employers and the public, and ha&s;ten the approach of the day that was to reward his labour with applau&s;e.</P>
<P>That day it was his happine&s;s to &s;ee; for, by the end of the year 1754, he had completed his copy, not more to his own ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction, than to the joy of Millar the book&s;eller, the principal proprietor of the work, and the guardian or trea&s;urer of the fund out of which the payments were from time to time i&s;&s;ued. To &s;ay the truth, his joy on the occa&s;ion was &s;o great, that he could not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing it &s;omewhat intemperately, as appears by the following
<PB N="341" REF="346">
acknowledgment of the receipt of the la&s;t &s;heet of the manu&s;cript:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Andrew Millar &s;ends his compliments to Mr. Samuel John&s;on, with the money for the la&s;t &s;heet of copy of the Dictionary, and thanks God he has done with him.'</Q></P>
<P>To which John&s;on returned this good-humoured and brief an&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Samuel John&s;on returns his compliments to Mr. Andrew Millar, and is very glad to find, as he does by his note, that Andrew Millar has the grace to thank God for any thing.'</Q></P>
<P>The publication of this great work &s;oon followed, as may be imagined, the interchange of the&s;e two very laconic epi&s;tles; and the month of May 1755, put the world in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a trea&s;ure, the va|lue whereof it will require the experience of years to find out. To recommend it to the notice of foreigners, he was de&s;irous it &s;hould appear to come from one who had attained academical honours: he therefore applied, by his friend Mr. Thomas Warton, to the univer&s;ity of Oxford for a ma&s;ter's degree, and obtained it by a diploma, dated the tenth day of February 1755, the tenour whereof is, that the mo&s;t learned Samuel John&s;on, of Pembroke college, hav|ing di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the literary world by his writings, tending to form the popular manners; and having, for the adorning and &s;ettling his native lan|guage, compiled, and being about to publi&s;h an Engli&s;h dictionary, the chancellor, ma&s;ters, and &s;cholars of the &s;aid Univer&s;ity, in &s;olemn convocation a&s;&s;embled, do therefore con&s;titute and appoint the &s;aid Samuel

<P>Upon the receipt of this in&s;trument, John&s;on te&s;ti|fied his gratitude for the honour done him, in a letter to the vice-chancellor, which, as a &s;pecimen of a fine Latin &s;tyle, I here in&s;ert:<LETTER>

<P>So near perfection had the author brought his dictionary, that, upon a review of it previous to his drawing up the preface, he declares, he is unable to detect the ca&s;ual omi&s;&s;ion of more than one article,
<PB N="343" REF="348">
the appellative OCEAN. Nor has he, as I know, been charged with any other defect, or with any mi&s;interpretation of a word, &s;ave in an in&s;tance or two, where, being moved by party-prejudice, he has impo&s;ed &s;ignifications on a few words that are in|defen&s;ible.

<P>Upon occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing the dictionary, Mr. Garrick celebrated the author in the following lines:<Q><L>Talk of war with a Briton, he'll boldly advance,</L>

<P>It has already been mentioned, that John&s;on's in|ducement to this undertaking was the offer of a libe|ral reward. The term liberal is indefinite, and, after the lap&s;e of twenty years, during which &s;uch &s;ums as from three to eight thou&s;and pounds have been paid for copies, would hardly be allowed to fifteen hun|dred and &s;eventy-five<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From the original contract now in my hand, dated 18th June 1746, between John&s;on on the one part, and the two Knap|tons, the two Longmans, Charles Hitch, Andrew Millar, and Robert Dod&s;ley on the other.</NOTE>, which was the &s;um &s;tipulated for the dictionary. Of this, John&s;on, who was no very accurate accountant, thought a great part would be coming to him on the conclu&s;ion of the work; but upon producing, at a tavern-meeting for the pur|po&s;e of &s;ettling, receipts for &s;ums advanced to him, which were indeed the chief means of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, it was found, not only that he had eaten his cake, but that the balance of the account was greatly again&s;t him. His debtors were now become his creditors; but they, in a perfect con&s;i&s;tency with that liberal &s;pirit, which, in &s;undry in&s;tances, the great book|&s;ellers are known to have exerci&s;ed towards authors, remitted the difference, and con&s;oled him for his di&s;|appointment by making his entertainment at the tavern a treat<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mr. William Ca&s;lon the letter-founder, grandfather of the pre&s;ent Mr. Ca&s;lon, once told me, that the book&s;ellers with whom Mr. Chambers had contracted for his dictionary, finding that the work &s;ucceeded beyond their expectations, made him a voluntary pre&s;ent of, I think, 500l. Other in&s;tances of the like genero&s;ity have been known of a profe&s;&s;ion of men, who, in the debates of the que&s;tion of literary property, have been de&s;cribed as &s;candalous monopolizers, fattening at the expence of other mens' ingenuity, and growing opulent by oppre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>

The pointing out the utility of &s;uch a work as a vernacular lexicon is needle&s;s, and the di&s;playing the merits of that of which I am &s;peaking, is a labour which the &s;uffrage of the public has &s;aved me. The learned world had long wi&s;hed for its appearance, and the circulation of the book was proportionate to the impatience which the promi&s;e of it had ex|cited. Lord Corke, being at Florence at the time when it was publi&s;hed, pre&s;ented it, in the author's name, to the academy della Cru&s;ca, and that learned body tran&s;mitted to him a fine copy of their Vocabu|lario. The French academy al&s;o &s;ignified their ap|probation of his labours, by a pre&s;ent of their Diction|naire, of which Mr. Langton was the bearer. To the&s;e te&s;timonies of public re&s;pect, it is a &s;mall but Judi|crous addition to &s;ay, that Dr. Robert&s;on, the Scots hi&s;torian, told John&s;on, that he had fairly peru&s;ed his dictionary twice over, and that John&s;on was plea&s;ed at the hearing it. The dictionary was a library-book, and not adapted to common u&s;e: the book&s;ellers knowing this, and being encouraged by its &s;ucce&s;s, ea&s;ily prevailed on the author to abridge it in two octavo volumes, and made him a liberal recompence.</P>
<P>It was doubtle&s;s a great &s;atisfaction to John&s;on to have completed this great work; and though we may

One and only one writer, ex|cited by that envy and malice which had been long rankling in his brea&s;t, attempted to di&s;turb the quiet which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, by animadverting on this and other of his writings: this was a Dr. Kenrick, the author of many &s;currilous publications now de&s;ervedly forgotten, who, in a &s;mall volume intitled <Q REND="inline">'Lexipha|nes,'</Q> endeavoured to turn many pa&s;&s;ages in the Rambler, and interpretations in the dictionary, into ridicule; gratifying his &s;pleen al&s;o with a number of malevolent cen&s;ures of Dr. Aken&s;ide's <Q REND="inline">'Plea&s;ures of Imagination.'</Q> It was the purpo&s;e of this libel to provoke both or one of the per&s;ons who were the &s;ubjects of it, to a controver&s;y, from which, whatever &s;hould be the event, he hoped, as it is &s;aid Uly&s;&s;es did in his conte&s;t with Ajax, to derive honour.<Q><L>I&s;te tulit pretium jam nunc certaminis hujus;</L>

<P>His &s;teady per&s;everance in this re&s;olution afforded him great &s;atisfaction whenever he reflected on it; and he would often &s;elicitate him&s;elf, that, throughout his life, he had had firmne&s;s enough to treat with con|tempt the calumny and abu&s;e as well of open as concealed enemies, and the malevolence of tho&s;e ano|nymous &s;criblers, who&s;e trade is &s;lander, and wages infamy.</P>
<P>Had Pope pur&s;ued the &s;ame conduct, and forborne his revenge on Theobald, Cibber, and others who had provoked him, he had enjoyed his mu&s;e and that philo&s;ophical tranquility which he did but affect, and lived and died with dignity. The younger Richard&s;on once told me, that, upon the publication of Cibber's &s;econd letter, he came to his father's hou&s;e in Lincoln's-inn fields, and, upon en|tering the room where he was painting, with a coun|tenance that &s;poke the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">'So, I find another letter is come out:' but, continued he, '&s;uch things are &s;port to me:'</Q> in which a&s;&s;ertion we may &s;uppo&s;e him to be as &s;incere as that poet of whom a &s;tory goes, that, talking with a friend, of the critics, he &s;aid, he had a way of dealing with them; for, whenever they condemned his ver&s;es, he laughed at it. <Q REND="inline">'Do you &s;o?' &s;ays his friend, 'then, let me tell

<P>That Bentley's ob&s;ervation is founded in truth and a knowledge of mankind, is proved by the rank which Sir Richard Blackmore now holds among the Engli&s;h poets. At the time when he lived, the wits were in confederacy again&s;t him; and &s;o many are the lampoons, epigrams, and other &s;atirical compo&s;itions extant, tending to bla&s;t his reputation as a poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the works of Mr. Thomas Brown, in 4 vols. 12mo. and Pope and Swift's mi&s;cellany.</NOTE>, that the reader of them would incline to think, that in all his works there is &s;carce a good line or &s;enti|ment. All this, as John&s;on relates, Blackmore fore|&s;aw, and, with a dignity of mind that merits prai&s;e, de&s;pi&s;ed: the con&s;equence is, that his poem, intitled <Q REND="inline">'Creation,'</Q> is not written down, but yet lives in the e&s;|teem of every judicious reader, and in that mo&s;t elegant encomium, which Mr. Addi&s;on has be&s;towed on it in the Spectator<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">No. 339.</NOTE>; and Dennis, one of the &s;evere&s;t of critics, has given it greater prai&s;e than he ever vouch|&s;afed to any modern compo&s;ition, &s;aying, that it is <Q REND="inline">'a philo&s;ophical poem, which has equalled that of Lu|cretius in the beauty of its ver&s;ification, and infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed it in the &s;olidity and &s;trength of its rea|&s;oning.'</Q></P>
<P>To be in&s;en&s;ible of, and undi&s;turbed by, the envy and malice of others, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of a great mind, and, as it is the mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable, &s;o is it the &s;evere&s;t revenge we can take; for what &s;ight can be more ridiculous, than that of a crea|ture

To live in the dread of &s;lander, and to regu|late our conduct by the opinions, the whi&s;pers, the &s;urmi&s;es, or threats of either fooli&s;h or wicked men, is the wor&s;t of all &s;lavery: of him who cannot defy every attempt of this kind to di&s;turb his peace, but mu&s;t be whining and complaining of that enmity which, perhaps, does him honour, and &s;cribbling to refute tho&s;e calumnies which no one will believe, it may be &s;aid, as we &s;ay of a man labouring under a mortal di&s;ea&s;e: <Q REND="inline">'He is no man for this world.'</Q> If he choo&s;es a contrary cour&s;e to that above-re|commended, he does the work of tho&s;e that hate him, and will be &s;ure to feel the pangs of re&s;entment, and forego the enjoyment of a tranquil mind, and a con&s;cience void of offence, &s;o feelingly de&s;cribed in this &s;entence of lord Bacon: <Q REND="inline">'Certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a man's mind move in Charity, re&s;t in Providence, and turn upon the poles of Truth.'</Q></P>
<P>If John&s;on could ever be &s;aid to be idle, now was the time. He had, for nine years, been employed in his great work, and had fini&s;hed it: he had clo&s;ed the Rambler; and the Adventurer was clo&s;ed on him. He had it now in his choice to rea&s;&s;ume &s;ome one or other of tho&s;e various literary projects, which he had formed in the early part of his life, and are enumerated in a foregoing page of the&s;e memoirs; but the powers of his mind, di&s;tended by long and &s;evere exerci&s;e, became relaxed, and required re&s;t to bring them to their tone, and it was &s;ome time be|fore he could re&s;olve on any employment, &s;uited to his abilities, that carried with it any pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure,
<PB N="350" REF="355">
or hope of reward. This remi&s;&s;ion of his labour, which &s;eemed to be no more than nature her&s;elf called for, John&s;on, in tho&s;e &s;evere audits to which it was his practice to &s;ummon him&s;elf, would fre|quently condemn, &s;tyling it a wa&s;te of his time, and a mi&s;application of the talents with which he was gratefully con&s;cious that God had endowed him. Yet herein was he greatly mi&s;taken; for though Milton &s;ays of the &s;ervants of God,

<P>John&s;on's intellectual faculties could never be un|employed: when he was not writing he was thinking, and his thoughts had ever a tendency to the good of mankind; and that indolence, which, in his hours of contrition, he cen&s;ured as criminal, needed little ex|piation.</P>
<P>This rece&s;s from literary occupation continued, however, no longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. It has already been &s;hewn, that he was not only a friend to &s;uch vehicles of literary intelli|gence as Magazines and other epitomes of large works, but that he was a frequent contributor to them.

That it is pernicious to health is di&s;puted by phy|&s;icians: Quincy commends it, as an elegant and whole&s;ome beverage; Cheyne condemns it, as preju|dicial to the nervous &s;y&s;tem. Bi&s;hop Burnet, for many years, drank &s;ixteen large cups of it every morning, and never complained that it did him the lea&s;t injury. The two la&s;t objections, that tea is an ob&s;truction to indu&s;try, and that it impoveri&s;hes the nation, are poli|tical que&s;tions which I am not able to decide upon.</P>
<P>Epictetus &s;omewhere advi&s;es us to con&s;ider the gratification of the calls of hunger and thir&s;t, as acts of nece&s;&s;ity; to be performed as it were by the bye, but by no means to be e&s;timated among the enjoy|ments of life; and by a precept no le&s;s than divine, we are exhorted to take no thought what we &s;hall eat or what we &s;hall drink. John&s;on looked upon the former as a very &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s, and enjoyed the plea&s;ures of a &s;plendid table equally with mo&s;t men. It was, at no time of his life, plea&s;ing to &s;ee him at a meal; the greedine&s;s with which he ate, his total inattention to tho&s;e among whom he was &s;eated, and his profound &s;ilence in the hour of refection, were circum&s;tances that at the in&s;tant degraded him, and &s;hewed him to be more a &s;en&s;uali&s;t than a philo&s;opher. Moreover, he was a lover of tea to an exce&s;s hardly credible; whenever it appeared, he was almo&s;t raving, and by his impatience to be &s;erved, his ince&s;&s;ant calls for tho&s;e ingredients which make that liquor palatable, and the ha&s;te with which he &s;wallowed it down, he &s;eldom failed to make that a fatigue to every one el&s;e, which was intended as a general refre&s;hment. Such
<PB N="355" REF="360">
&s;igns of effeminacy as the&s;e, &s;uited but ill with the appearance of a man, who, for his bodily &s;trength and &s;tature, has been compared to Polyphemus.</P>
<P>This foible in John&s;on's character being known, it will excite no wonder in the reader to be told, that he readily embraced the opportunity of defend|ing his own practice, by an examen of Hanway's book. Accordingly, he began his remarks on it in the Literary Magazine, Number VII<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From 15th Oct. to 15th Nov. 1756.</NOTE>, but receiving from this author an injunction to forbear proceeding in his cen&s;ure till a &s;econd edition &s;hould appear, he &s;ubmitted, though it was a prohibition that could neither be rea&s;onably impo&s;ed, nor by any means inforced; yet, &s;uch was its effect, that Mr. Hanway's journal was not remarked on, till he had been allowed every advantage that could protect it from cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Such candour on the part of him, on who&s;e opinion perhaps many were waiting to form theirs, might have relieved the author from any dread of unfair treat|ment; but John&s;on, who paid all proper deference to good intentions, did not think this tacit indication of the temper in which he &s;at down to review Mr. Han|way's journal, &s;ufficient: he, therefore, in re&s;uming the di&s;pute, promi&s;es him, that he &s;hall find no ma|lignity of cen&s;ure, and draws a very hand&s;ome infer|ence from the contents of his thirty-two letters, that he is a man who&s;e failings may well be pardoned for his virtues.</P>
<P>The critici&s;m on this &s;econd edition appeared in the Literary Magazine, Number XIII<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From 15th April to 15th May, 1757.</NOTE>, and extends
<PB N="356" REF="361">
chiefly to Mr. Hanway's arguments again&s;t tea and gin: &s;ubjects which &s;eem to have in&s;pired him with &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic eloquence as di&s;dained all the rules of logic, and dictated ob&s;ervations and conclu&s;ions, &s;o incoherent and incongruous, as would have &s;timu|lated even tho&s;e, who, in the main, thought with him, to an endeavour at correcting his judgment.</P>
<P>But, in John&s;on, when writing on the qualities of tea, he met with an opponent on principle; for its antagoni&s;t's hatred, however radical or zealous, could not exceed the love its champion bore it: he de&s;cribes him&s;elf as <Q REND="inline">'a hardened and &s;hamele&s;s tea-drinker, who has, for many years, diluted his meals with only the infu&s;ion of this fa&s;cinating plant; who&s;e kettle has &s;carcely time to cool; who, with tea amu&s;es the evening, with tea &s;olaces the mid|nights, and with tea welcomes the morning.'</Q></P>
<P>That Mr. Hanway was right in a&s;&s;erting, that the practice of drinking tea is productive of harm among the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, mu&s;t certainly be admitted; and that John&s;on was right in denying that it has all the poi&s;onous qualities the Journal attributes to it, experience &s;hews. From what has been &s;aid on both &s;ides, little can be inferred, but that to &s;ome it is noxious, and to others neutral; that tho&s;e do wrong who per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of it when they find it injurious to their health, and that &s;uch as cannot afford the nece&s;&s;aries of life, ought not to in|dulge in its luxuries.</P>
<P>At John&s;on's candid examen, which &s;hould not have offended Mr. Hanway, as, by &s;ubmitting his work to public in&s;pection, he recognized the right of public critici&s;m, the latter was extremely irritated, and
<PB N="357" REF="362">
very unadvi&s;edly drew his reviewer forth to a &s;econd exertion of his argumentative powers, printed in the &s;ame Magazine, vol. ii. 253, under the title of <Q REND="inline">'A reply to a paper in the Gazetteer of May 26, 1757,'</Q> in which, with &s;eeming contrition and mock penitence he reque&s;ts to know how he has offended, and depre|cates the wrath he had excited.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'There are only three &s;ubjects,' &s;ays he, 'upon which my unlucky pen has happened to venture.

<P>Unluckily for Mr. Hanway it happened, that while he was labouring for the general good, by reprobating the practice of drinking tea, an in&s;titution from which he derived much of his importance, was &s;uffering from want of care. John&s;on, in a vi&s;it to the Foundling ho&s;pital, ob&s;erved, that the objects of the charity, however well provided for in other re&s;pects, were, in the e&s;&s;ential point of religious knowledge, lamentably deficient. To him, who con&s;idered wi&s;ely that there was no evil from which the governors of the Foundling ho&s;pital could re&s;cue de&s;erted infants, &s;o much to be dreaded as ignorance of this kind, the an&s;wers given to his enquiries touching their im|provement were very un&s;atisfactory. Without knowing that Mr. Hanway was concerned in the charge, he, in his former letter had &s;tated this fact, and followed it by &s;aying, that <Q REND="inline">'to breed up children in this manner, is to re&s;cue them from an early grave, that they may find employment for the gibbet, from dying in in|nocence, that they may peri&s;h by their crimes.'</Q></P>
<P>The laudable motive which induced John&s;on to point out this neglect, and the ju&s;tice of his remark, did not &s;hield him from unmerited re&s;entment. He was called on to &s;upport what he had advanced: his a&s;&s;er|tion was branded with the epithet of <HI>incredible,</HI> but his ob&s;ervation had produced its effect: he had found means to have it repre&s;ented to one of the highe&s;t names of the &s;ociety, and a catechi&s;t was &s;oon after appointed.</P>

By the virtues of Mr. Hanway, which John&s;on is &s;o ready to acknowledge, we are to under&s;tand, that active and unwearied benevolence, which, for a &s;eries of years, he has been exerci&s;ing for the benefit of &s;ociety, and by his failings, or rather failing, for I know of but one he has, a propen&s;ity to writing and publi&s;hing books, which, for the tritene&s;s and inanity of the &s;entiments contained in them, no one can read.</P>
<P>About the year 1756, time had produced a change in the &s;ituation of many of John&s;on's friends, who were u&s;ed to meet him in lvy lane. Death had ta|ken from us M^cGhie; Barker went to &s;ettle as a practi&s;ing phy&s;ician at Trowbridge; Dyer went abroad; Hawke&s;worth was bu&s;ied in forming new connections; and I had lately made one that re|moved from me all temptations to pa&s;s my even|ings from home. The con&s;equence was, that our &s;ympo&s;ium at the King's head broke up, and he who had fir&s;t formed us into a &s;ociety was left with &s;ewer around him than were able to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>All this while, the book&s;ellers, who by his own confe&s;&s;ion were his be&s;t friends, had their eyes upon John&s;on, and reflected with &s;ome concern on what &s;eemed to them a mi&s;application of his talents. The furni&s;hing magazines, reviews, and even news|papers, with literary intelligence, and the authors of books, who could not write them for them&s;elves, with dedications and prefaces, they looked on as employ|ments beneath him, who had attained to &s;uch emi|nence as a writer; they, therefore, in the year 1756, found out for him &s;uch a one as &s;eemed to afford a pro&s;pect both of amu&s;ement and profit: this was an edition of Shake&s;peare's dramatic works,
<PB N="361" REF="366">
which, by a concurrence of circum&s;tances, was now become nece&s;&s;ary, to an&s;wer the increa&s;ing demand of the public for the writings of that author.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, who, as every one knows, was in all that related to Shake&s;peare an enthu&s;ia&s;t, had, by the &s;tudy of his principal characters, and his own exqui|&s;ite action, &s;o recommended Shake&s;peare to the town, that the admiration of him became general even to affectation; many profe&s;&s;ing to be delighted with the performance and peru&s;al of his plays, who, from their want of literature, and their ignorance of the phra&s;eology of the age in which they were written, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of con&s;truing them. Others there were, in whom a literary curio&s;ity had been excited, by the publication of &s;uch editions of this author as tended to &s;ettle his text, and by a de&s;cription of ancient manners and cu&s;toms of living, to render him intelligible. The fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of this kind, worth noting, was the edition of Theobald, the defects where|of, in the &s;ingle opinion of Warburton, were &s;o many and great, as to render that nece&s;&s;ary which bears his name.</P>
<P>The two cla&s;&s;es of readers, here di&s;criminated, amounted to &s;uch a number as encouraged the book&s;ellers to an edition on the plan of the two former, and John&s;on was the per&s;on, whom, of all others, they thought the fitte&s;t to undertake it: the terms &s;ettled between them were, that John&s;on &s;hould receive for his own u&s;e the profits ari&s;ing from a &s;ub&s;cription to the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and that the copy-right &s;hould remain with the then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. The fir&s;t notification of this de&s;ign was, a propo&s;al
<PB N="362" REF="367">
drawn up by John&s;on, &s;etting forth the incorrect|ne&s;s of the early editions, the original ob&s;curity and &s;ub&s;equent corruptions of the text, the nece&s;&s;ity of notes, and the failures of former editors.</P>
<P>A &s;tranger to John&s;on's character and temper would have thought, that the &s;tudy of an author, who&s;e &s;kill in the &s;cience of human life was &s;o deep, and who&s;e perfections were &s;o many and various as to be above the reach of all prai&s;e, mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t plea&s;ing employment that his imagination could &s;ugge&s;t, but it was not &s;o: in a vi&s;it that he one morning made to me, I congratulated him on his being now engaged in a work that &s;uited his genius, and that, requiring none of that &s;evere application which his dictionary had condemned him to, I doubted not would be exe|cuted con amore.&mdash;His an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">'I look upon this as I did upon the dictionary: it is all work, and my inducement to it is not love or de&s;ire of fame, but the want of money, which is the only motive to writing that I know of.'&mdash;</Q>And the event was evidence to me, that in this &s;peech he declared his genuine &s;entiments; for neither in the fir&s;t place did he &s;et him&s;elf to collect early editions of his author, old plays, tran&s;lations of hi&s;tories, and of the cla&s;&s;ics, and other materials nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e, nor could he be prevailed on to enter into that cour&s;e of reading, without which it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to come at the &s;en&s;e of his author. It was provoking to all his friends to &s;ee him wa&s;te his days, his weeks, and his months &s;o long, that they feared a mental lethargy had &s;eized him, out of which he would never recover. In this, however, they were happily deceived, for, after
<PB N="363" REF="368">
two years inactivity, they find him rou&s;ed to action, and engaged&mdash;not in the pro&s;ecution of the work, for the completion whereof he &s;tood doubly bound, but in a new one, the furni&s;hing a &s;eries of periodical e&s;&s;ays, intitled, and it may be thought not improperly, <Q REND="inline">'The Idler,'</Q> as his motive to the employment was aver&s;ion to a labour he had undertaken, though in the execution, it mu&s;t be owned, it merited a better name.</P>
<P>As John&s;on was diverted from his work of Shake|&s;peare, &s;o am I from my purpo&s;e of tracing the progre&s;s of it, being to relate the occurrences of nine years of his life before I can congratulate the reader on its appearance.</P>
<P>The engagement for the Idler was with Newbery the book&s;eller, a man of a projecting head, a good under&s;tanding, and great integrity; and who, by a fortunate connection with Dr. James the phy&s;ician, and the hone&s;t exertions of his own indu&s;try, be|came the founder of a family. Taking advantage of that rage for intelligence, which the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the war had excited, in even the lowe&s;t order of the people, he planned a weekly paper, which he called <Q REND="inline">'The Univer&s;al Chronicle,'</Q> and, as the &s;ize of it ren|dered it &s;u&s;ceptible of more matter than the occur|rences, during the intervals of its publication, would &s;upply, it was part of his &s;cheme, that it &s;hould con|tain an e&s;&s;ay or &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e on &s;uch &s;ubjects of morality, or of wit and humour, as, in former in&s;tances, had been &s;ound to engage the attention of the public. A &s;hare in the profits of this paper was John&s;on's in|ducement to the furni&s;hing &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e, and, ac|cordingly, it appeared, on Saturday the fifteenth day
<PB N="364" REF="369">
of April 1758, and continued to be publi&s;hed on the &s;ame day in every week for near two years thence fol|lowing.</P>
<P>The profits accruing from the &s;ale of this paper, and the &s;ub&s;criptions which, from the year 1756, he was receiving for the edition of Shake&s;peare by him pro|po&s;ed, were the only known means of his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for a period of near four years, and we may &s;uppo&s;e them hardly adequate to his wants, for, upon finding the balance of the account for the dictionary again&s;t him, he quitted his hou&s;e in Gough &s;quare, and took chambers in Gray's inn; and Mrs. Williams, upon this removal, fixed her&s;elf in lodgings at a boarding-&s;chool in the neighbourhood of their for|mer dwelling.</P>
<P>About this time he had, from a friend who highly e&s;teemed him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Langton, of Langton in Lincoln&s;hire, the father of his much-beloved friend Bennet Langton, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> mentioned in the codi|cil his will, and hu&s;band of the counte&s;s dowager of Rothes.</NOTE>, the offer of a living, of which he might have rendered him&s;elf capable by entering into holy orders: it was a rectory, in a plea&s;ant country, and of &s;uch a yearly value as might have tempted one in better circum&s;tances than him&s;elf to accept it; but he had &s;cruples about the duties of the mini&s;terial function, that he could not, after deliberation, over|come. <Q REND="inline">'I have not,' &s;aid he, 'the requi&s;ites for the office, and I cannot, in my con&s;cience, &s;hear that flock which I am unable to feed.'&mdash;</Q>Upon conver&s;ing with him on that inability which was his rea&s;on for declining the offer, it was found to be a &s;u&s;picion of his patience to undergo the fatigue of catechi&s;ing and in&s;tructing a great number of poor ignorant per&s;ons,
<PB N="365" REF="370">
who, in religious matters, had, perhaps, every thing to learn.</P>
<P>Thus &s;crupulou&s;ly did he think of the nature of the mini&s;terial office, and thus did he te&s;tify the &s;incerity of tho&s;e cen&s;ures, which he would &s;ometimes pa&s;s on the conduct of the generality of the clergy of his time; for though, as a body of men, he held them in great veneration, and was ever ready to defend them again&s;t the encroachments of &s;ome, and the re|proaches of others of the ignorant laity, he exacted from all who had the cure of &s;ouls a punctilious di&s;|charge of their duty, and held in utter dete&s;tation tho&s;e who, renouncing their garb and clerical cha|racter, affected to appear men of the world.</P>
<P>He thought of Dr. Clarke, who&s;e &s;ermons he valued above all other, that he complied too frequently with invitations to dine with per&s;ons of high rank, his pa|ri&s;hioners, and &s;pent too much of his time in cere|monious vi&s;its: differing in this re&s;pect from his con|temporary Smalridge, the elegant Favonius of the Tatler, who, in the height of his reputation as a preacher, was ever ready to vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure alley of We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1759, and while the Idler continued to be publi&s;hed, an event happened, for which it might be imagined he was well prepared, the death of his mother, who had then attained the age of ninety; but he, who&s;e mind had acquired no firmne&s;s by the contemplation of mortality, was as little able to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock as he would have been had this lo&s;s befallen him in his nonage. It is conjectured that, for many years before her decea&s;e, &s;he derived almo&s;t the whole of her &s;upport from this
<PB N="366" REF="371">
her dutiful &s;on, who&s;e filial piety was ever one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hable features in his character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I find in his diary a note of the payment to Mr. Allen the printer, of &s;ix guineas, which he had borrowed of him, and &s;ent to his dying mother.</NOTE>. Report &s;ays, but rather vaguely, that, to &s;upply her nece&s;&s;ities in her la&s;t illne&s;s, he wrote and made money of his <Q REND="inline">'Ra&s;&s;elas,'</Q> a tale of his invention, numbered among the be&s;t of his writings, and pub|li&s;hed in the &s;pring of 1759, a cri&s;is that gives credit to &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition. No. 41 of the Idler, though it pretends to be a letter to the author, was written by John&s;on him&s;elf, on occa&s;ion of his mother's death, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;cribe, as truly as patheti|cally, his &s;entiments on the &s;eparation of friends and relations. The fact, re&s;pecting the writing and publi&s;hing the &s;tory of Ra&s;&s;elas is, that finding the Ea&s;tern Tales written by him&s;elf in the Rambler, and by Hawke&s;worth in the Adventurer, had been well received, he had been for &s;ome time meditating a fictitious hi&s;tory, of a greater extent than any that had appeared in either of tho&s;e papers, which might &s;erve as a vehicle to convey to the world his &s;enti|ments of human life and the di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence, and having dige&s;ted his thoughts on the &s;ub|ject, he obeyed the &s;pur of that nece&s;&s;ity which now pre&s;&s;ed him, and &s;at down to compo&s;e the tale above|mentioned, laying the &s;cene of it in a country that he had before occa&s;ion to contemplate, in his tran&s;lation of Padre Lobo's voyage.</P>
<P>As it was written to rai&s;e money, he did not long delay di&s;po&s;ing of it; he gave it, as I have been told, to Mr. Baretti, to &s;ell to that book&s;eller who would
<PB N="367" REF="372">
give mo&s;t for it, but the &s;um he got for it is va|riou&s;ly reported. As none of his compo&s;itions have been more applauded than this, an examen of it in this place may not be improper, and the following may &s;erve till a better &s;hall appear.</P>
<P>Con&s;idered as a &s;pecimen of our language, it is &s;carcely to be paralleled: it is written in a &s;tyle refined to a degree of immaculate purity, and di&s;|plays the whole force of turgid eloquence.</P>
<P>But it was compo&s;ed at a time when no &s;pring like that in the mind of Ra&s;&s;elas urged his narrator; when the heavy hand of affliction almo&s;t bore him down, and the dread of future want haunted him. That he &s;hould have produced a tale fraught with lively ima|gery, or that he &s;hould have painted human life in gay colours, could not have been expected: he pour|ed out his &s;orrow in gloomy reflection, and being de&s;titute of comfort him&s;elf, de&s;cribed the world as nearly without it.</P>
<P>In a work of &s;uch latitude as this, where nothing could be impertinent, he had an opportunity of divulg|ing his opinion on any point that he had thought on: he has therefore formed many conver&s;ations on topics that are known to have been &s;ubjects of his medita|tion, and has atoned for the paucity of his incidents by &s;uch di&s;cu&s;&s;ions as are &s;eldom attempted by the fabricators of romantic fiction.</P>
<P>Admitting that John&s;on &s;peaks in the per&s;on of the victor-di&s;putant, we may, while he is unveiling the hearts of others, gain &s;ome knowledge of his own. He has in this Aby&s;&s;inian tale given us what he calls a di&s;&s;ertation on poetry, and in it that which appears to
<PB N="368" REF="373">
me a recipe for making a poet, from which may be in|ferred what he thought the nece&s;&s;ary ingredients, and a reference to the pa&s;&s;age will tend to corroborate an ob&s;ervation of Mr. Garrick's, that John&s;on's poetical faculty was mechanical, and that what he wrote came not from his heart but from his head. Imlac, the guide of the prince, relates to him the events of his life, which are&mdash;That his father was a wealthy merchant, but a man of uncultivated intellects, who left the choice of a profe&s;&s;ion, with very little bia&s;s, to his &s;on. The young man was di&s;gu&s;ted with trade, and inclined to general learning; but finding, as he &s;ays, that poetry was con&s;idered as the highe&s;t learning, and regarded with veneration, he determined to be|come a poet. Ambition has &s;eldom effected &s;o &s;tu|pendous a work as that of implanting poetic genius; but Imlac was re&s;olved, and, if we may tru&s;t the ac|count of his &s;ucce&s;s, his de&s;ign was not ab&s;urd: his indu&s;try was very commendable: he red all the poets of Arabia and Per&s;ia, and was able to repeat by me|mory the volumes that are &s;u&s;pended in the mo&s;que of Mecca: he then ranged mountains and de&s;arts for images and re&s;emblances, and pictured on his mind every tree of the fore&s;t and flower of the val|ley: an ample collection drawn from rocks, palaces, rivulets, clouds, &amp;c. &s;tored his mind, and with the help of ethics, languages, and &s;ciences, the re&s;olute Imlac, who, till the age of twenty, had lived in igno|rance, was by dint of mere indu&s;try transformed into a di&s;tingui&s;hed poet.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of Imlac's narrative, John&s;on ani|madverts on the &s;uppo&s;ed efficacy of pilgrimages:
<PB N="369" REF="374">
his argument decides nothing, but is conceived in &s;uch language, that none, how well acquainted &s;oever with the book, will blame the in&s;ertion of it here.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Pilgrimages, like many other acts of piety, may be rea&s;onable or &s;uper&s;titious, according to the prin|ciples upon which they are performed. Long journeys in &s;earch of truth are not commanded. Truth, &s;uch as is nece&s;&s;ary to the regulation of life, is always found where it is hone&s;tly &s;ought. Change of place is no natural cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of piety, for it inevitably produces di&s;&s;ipation of mind. Yet, &s;ince men go every day to view the fields where great actions have been performed, and return with &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ions of the event, curio|&s;ity of the &s;ame kind may naturally di&s;po&s;e us to view that country whence our religion had its beginning; and I believe no man &s;urveys tho&s;e awful &s;cenes without &s;ome confirmation of holy re&s;olutions. That the Supreme Being may be more ea&s;ily propitiated in one place than in another, is the dream of idle &s;uper&s;tition; but that &s;ome places may operate upon our own minds in an uncommon manner, is an opinion which hourly experience will ju&s;tify. He who &s;uppo&s;es that his vices may be more &s;ucce&s;sfully combated in Pale&s;tine, will, perhaps, find him&s;elf mi&s;taken, yet he may go thither without folly: he who thinks they will be more freely pardoned, di&s;honours at once his rea&s;on and religion.'</Q></P>
<P>In a following chapter the danger of in&s;anity is the &s;ubject of debate; and it cannot but excite the pity
<PB N="370" REF="375">
of all tho&s;e who gratefully accept and enjoy John&s;on's endeavours to reform and in&s;truct, to reflect that the peril he de&s;cribes he believed impending over him. That he was con&s;cious of &s;uperior talents will &s;urely not be imputed to vanity: how deeply then mu&s;t he have been depre&s;&s;ed by the con&s;tant fear that in one moment he might and probably would be, not only deprived of his di&s;tingui&s;hed endowments, but re|duced to a &s;tate little preferable, in as much as re&s;pects this world, to that of brutes! He has traced the mi|&s;ery of in&s;anity from its cau&s;e to its effect, and &s;eems to a&s;cribe it to indulgence of imagination: he &s;tyles it one of the dangers of &s;olitude, and perhaps to this dread and this opinion was his uncommon love of &s;o|ciety to be attributed.</P>
<P>His &s;uper&s;titious ideas of the &s;tate of departed &s;ouls, and belief in &s;upernatural agency, were produced by a mental di&s;ea&s;e, as impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;haken off as cor|poral pain. What it has plea&s;ed Omnipotence to in|flict, we need never &s;eek to excu&s;e; but he has pro|vided again&s;t the cavils of tho&s;e who cannot compre|hend how a wi&s;e can ever appear a weak man, by re|marking, that there is a natural affinity between me|lancholy and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>In characteri&s;ing this performance, it cannot be &s;aid, that it vindicates the ways of God to man. It is a general &s;atire, repre&s;enting mankind as eagerly pur&s;u|ing what experience &s;hould have taught them they can never obtain: it expo&s;es the weakne&s;&s;es even of their laudable affections and propen&s;ities, and it re|&s;olves the mightie&s;t as well as the mo&s;t trivial of their labours, into folly.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="376">
I wi&s;h I were not warranted in &s;aying, that this elegant work is rendered, by its mo&s;t obvious moral, of little be|nefit to the reader. We would not indeed wi&s;h to &s;ee the ri&s;ing generation &s;o unprofitably employed as the prince of Aby&s;&s;inia; but it is equally impolitic to repre&s;s all hope, and he who &s;hould quit his father's hou&s;e in &s;earch of a profe&s;&s;ion, and return unprovided, becau&s;e he could not find any man plea&s;ed with his own, would need a better ju&s;tification than that John&s;on, after &s;peculatively &s;urveying various modes of life, had judged happine&s;s unattainable, and choice u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>But let tho&s;e, who, reading Ra&s;&s;elas in the &s;pring of life, are captivated by its author's eloquence, and convinced by his per&s;picacious wi&s;dom that human life and hopes are &s;uch as he has depicted them, re|member that he &s;aw through the medium of adver|&s;ity. The concurrent te&s;timony of ages has, it is too true, proved, that there is no &s;uch thing as worldly felicity; but it has never been proved, that, there|fore we are mi&s;erable. Tho&s;e who look only here for happine&s;s, have ever been and ever will be di&s;ap|pointed: it is not change of place, nor even the un|bounded gratification of their wi&s;hes that can relieve them; but if they bend their attention towards the attainment of that felicity we are graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, they will find no &s;uch vacuum as di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ra&s;&s;elas: the di&s;charge of religious and &s;ocial duties will afford their faculties the occupation he wanted, and the well|founded expectation of future reward will at once &s;timulate and &s;upport them.</P>
<P>The tale of Ra&s;&s;elas was written to an&s;wer a pre&s;&s;|ing nece&s;&s;ity, and was &s;o concluded as to admit of a
<PB N="372" REF="377">
continuation; and, in fact, John&s;on had meditated a &s;econd part, in which he meant to marry his hero, and place him in a &s;tate of permanent felicity, but it fared with this re&s;olution as it did with that of Dr. Young, who, in his e&s;timate of human life, promi&s;ed, as he had given the dark, &s;o in a future publication he would di&s;play the bright &s;ide of his &s;ubject; he never did it, for he had found out that it had no bright &s;ide, and John&s;on had made much the fame di&s;covery, and that in this &s;tate of our exi&s;tence all our enjoyments are fugacious, and permanent felicity unattainable.</P>
<P>Soon after the publication of Ra&s;&s;elas, and while he continued to write the Idler, John&s;on was tempted to engage in a controver&s;y on a &s;ubject with which, in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, he had acquired but little knowledge, namely, the comparative &s;trength of arches of different forms; the occa&s;ion of it was, that after the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of parliament for building Black-Friars bridge, a variety of de&s;igns for it were tendered to the commi&s;&s;ioners, who, after due con&s;ideration, reduced them to three. In two of the&s;e de&s;igns, the con&s;truction of the arches was &s;e|micircular; in the third, exhibited by Mr. Mylne a Scot&s;man, it was elliptical.</P>
<P>Whether John&s;on thought that the author of this la&s;t propo&s;al, as being a native of North Britain, me|rited to be treated as an intruder, or that he was in|duced by better motives to oppo&s;e his &s;cheme, can|not be determined: this, at lea&s;t, is certain, that he took up the re&s;olution before he was qualified to debate the que&s;tion, for I have it from undoubted

<P>If the former of the con&s;iderations above &s;ug|ge&s;ted, was at any time, or in any degree, John&s;on's motive for oppo&s;ing Mr. Mylne, he ought to have re|flected, that at a period when we had no better archi|tects than Vanbrugh, Hawk&s;moor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vanbrugh and Hawk&s;moor had &s;uch ideas of beauty and harmony as have no archetypes in the material world: the latter in an evil hour was employed by the commi&s;&s;ioners for building fifty new churches, as al&s;o by a pari&s;h in the city, St. Mary Wool|noth, in the re-edification of an old one, and has left his mark be|hind him in &s;everal parts of this kingdom.</NOTE>, James and Kent among us<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">James and Kent were mere decorators, and could do little more than de&s;ign a &s;aloon, a gallery, or a &s;creen.

not his own, and &s;o far as regards &s;ymmetry and corre&s;pondence of parts, how little he was qualified to judge of &s;ymmetry and the corre&s;pondence of parts, who&s;e eye was never capable of compre|hending the dome of St. Paul's cathedral, or the towers of We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey. However, armed as he is above &s;aid to have been, with rea&s;ons again&s;t Mr. Mylne's de&s;ign, he began an attack on it in a letter to the publi&s;her of the Daily Gazetteer, in&s;erted in that paper for the fir&s;t day of December 1759, and continued it in the &s;ucceeding papers of the eighth and fifteenth of the &s;ame month. To one or more of the&s;e letters, an&s;wers were publi&s;hed, in which it was contended, that at Florence there is a bridge that cro&s;&s;es the river Arno, of an elliptical form, but the argument drawn from thence, John&s;on had refuted in his fir&s;t letter, by ob&s;erving, that the &s;tability thereof is &s;o much doubted, that carts are not permitted to pa&s;s over it, and that it has &s;tood two hundred years without imitation. The&s;e, and many other arguments, as al&s;o the opinion of that excellent mathematician Mr. Tho|mas Simp&s;on, were not of &s;ufficient weight with the committee for building the bridge, to recommend the &s;emicircular arch, Mr. Mylne's de&s;ign was preferred, and the arches are elliptical.</P>
<P>I have already remarked, that John&s;on was un|&s;killed in the &s;cience of architecture, and I might have added, that he was a &s;tranger to the very rudi|ments of it. He could not el&s;e have failed to notice, in the edifice here &s;poken of, one of the mo&s;t egre|gious errors that ever di&s;graced a &s;tructure of its kind; columns di&s;proportionate in the ratio between
<PB N="375" REF="380">
their heights and their diameters. The proportion of a column is taken from that of the human figure, which, at a medium, is in a man &s;e&s;quioctave of the head, and in a woman &s;e&s;quinonal. The computa|tion of columns by modules or diameters, comes to much the &s;ame, and according to Palladio, gives, to one of the Doric order, the ma&s;culine proportion of eight of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, and, to one of the Ionic, the feminine of nine.</P>
<P>Proportions, thus adju&s;ted by nature, admit of no deviation; whenever that is attempted, deformity en&s;ues, as is to be &s;een in the in&s;tance before us, where we behold a range of Ionic columns, level, it is true, at their ba&s;es, but ri&s;ing from their due pro|portion at the extremities, in gradation, like the pipes in the front of an organ, to the central arch, where, in&s;tead of the proportion of a column, they a&s;&s;ume that of a candle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Columns thus di&s;proportionate, but in a le&s;s degree, are al&s;o to be &s;een in the portico of the admiralty-office, de&s;igned by Ripley, who, from a carpenter that kept a &s;hop, and al&s;o a coffee-hou&s;e, in Wood &s;treet, Cheap&s;ide, by marrying a &s;ervant of a mini&s;ter ob|tained a &s;eat at the Board of Works.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be &s;aid, that the great elevation of the centre-arch required this prepo&s;terous elon|gation of the columns. To this it may be an&s;wered, that proportion is not to be wre&s;ted to bye-purpo&s;es, and that where beautiful forms cannot be introduced, they mu&s;t be given up, and ornament yield place to convenience. It is &s;aid, that the idea of columns &s;tanding on the piers of a bridge was &s;ugge&s;ted by a de&s;ign of Pirane&s;i, extant among his works, but
<PB N="376" REF="381">
without an a&s;&s;ertion that he a&s;&s;umed the licence here reprobated. Should he in any in&s;tance be found to have done &s;o, the example of a genius, &s;o wildly magnificent as his, will weigh but little again&s;t the practice of Palladio, Scamozzi, Vignola, and, let me add, the earl of Pembroke, the architect of We&s;tmin|&s;ter bridge, who, in all &s;uch emergencies as that in&s;i&s;ted on, evaded the nece&s;&s;ity of violating the rules of their art, by rejecting incongruous decora|tions, and tru&s;ted to the applau&s;e they &s;hould ac|quire by uniting levity and convenience with &s;ta|bility.</P>
<P>There are, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, per&s;ons who are as blind to &s;ymmetry and the beauty of forms, as others are deaf to the harmony of according &s;ounds, who deny that there are any criteria by which we can di&s;criminate beauty from deformity in one &s;ubject, and con&s;onance from di&s;&s;onance in the other, and who a&s;&s;ert that ta&s;te is capricious and has no &s;tandard, and that fancy is its own arbiter. Let &s;uch enjoy their ignorance, while we are engaged in an inve&s;tiga|tion of the principles into which the plea&s;ures of the eye and ear are re&s;olvable. The re&s;ult of &s;uch an enquiry will be a thorough conviction, that all of what we under&s;tand by the terms &s;ymmetry and har|mony has its foundation in mathematical ratios and proportions, that exi&s;t in all the modifications of mat|ter, and are but emanations of that power, which has ordered all things in number, weight and mea&s;ure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the&s;e the principal are the equal 1 to 1, the &s;e&s;quialteral 2 to 3, the &s;e&s;quitertian 3 to 4, and the duple 1 to 2, an&s;wering to the uni&s;on, the diapente, the diate&s;&s;aron, and the diapa&s;on, the &s;weete&s;t concords in mu&s;ic.</NOTE>.</P>

He continued this paper to the extent of one hun|dred and three numbers, and on Saturday the fifth day of April 1760, clo&s;ed it with an e&s;&s;ay, containing a &s;olemn and very affecting contemplation on the words <HI>this is the la&s;t,</HI> in various &s;ignifications. The concluding paragraph &s;eems to have been written under the pre&s;&s;ure of that melancholy, which, almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly afflicted him, heightened, perhaps, by the approach of a &s;ea&s;on of the year, to Chri&s;tians the mo&s;t &s;olemn. The reflections, contained in it, are very &s;e|rious, and &s;o elegantly expre&s;&s;ed, that in the hope that the peru&s;al of it will not prove contagious to the rea|der, I here give it at length.</P>

The Idler, taken as the title of a &s;eries of moral and oeconomical e&s;&s;ays, is a de&s;ignation that imports little; or, rather, its mo&s;t obvious meaning is a bad one. John&s;on was at a lo&s;s for a fitter, but he could hit on no one that had not been pre-occupied. He cho&s;e an irony, and meant that his readers &s;hould under|&s;tand by it ju&s;t the rever&s;e of what it &s;ignified; and, in this his intention, he was in little danger of being mi&s;taken, or being charged with idlene&s;s by any of tho&s;e whom he was labouring, by all the powers of rea&s;on and eloquence, to make wi&s;er and better.</P>
<P>The plan and conduct of the Idler re&s;embles &s;o nearly that of the Rambler and the Adventurer, that what has been &s;aid of each of tho&s;e publications, might &s;erve for a character of this, &s;aving, that in this latter, admi&s;&s;ion is given to a greater num|ber of papers, calculated to entertain the mind with plea&s;ing fictions, humorous characters, and va|ried repre&s;entations of familiar life, than is to be found in either of the two former, the general effect whereof is, delight, too &s;oon interrupted by their &s;hortne&s;s. The &s;econd number of the Idler con|tains an invitation to corre&s;pondents, and it had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other hands; but I know but of three papers that can with certainty be &s;aid to have been written by any other than John&s;on him&s;elf; one of the three is No. 67, by Mr. Langton; the other two, No. 76 and 79, are on the &s;ubject of painting, and, in an evening-hour when his pencil was at re&s;t, were compo&s;ed by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds. And here let me take notice, that in the publication of the Idler, at lea&s;t when it was collected into volumes, John&s;on and
<PB N="381" REF="386">
Newbery were joint-adventurers, and that they di|vided equally the profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale thereof.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, as al&s;o the Rambler, and tho&s;e in the Adventurer which John&s;on wrote, little remains to be remarked, except that, notwith&s;tanding the depth of thinking which they di&s;play, and the nervous and elegant &s;tyle in which they are penned, they were extemporaneous compo&s;itions, and hardly ever under|went a revi&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of his facility in compo&s;ition, and the rapidity with which he wrote for the pre&s;s, here follow a few in&s;tances: Savage's life, con|taining a hundred and eighty octavo pages, was the work of thirty-&s;ix hours. He was wont to furni&s;h for the Gentleman's Magazine three columns of the debates in an hour, written, as my&s;elf can at|te&s;t, in a character that almo&s;t any one might read. His preface to <Q REND="inline">'The Preceptor,'</Q> and his <Q REND="inline">'Vi&s;ion of Theodore,'</Q> were each the work of one &s;itting, as was al&s;o the fir&s;t &s;eventy lines of his tran&s;lation of the tenth &s;atire of Juvenal, entitled, <Q REND="inline">'The vanity of human Wi&s;hes;'</Q> and what is almo&s;t incredible, he never red his Ra&s;&s;elas but in the proofs which came to him from the pre&s;s for correction.</P></NOTE> before they were &s;ent to the pre&s;s. The original manu&s;cripts of the Rambler have pa&s;&s;ed through my hands, and by the peru&s;al of them I am warranted to &s;ay, as was &s;aid of Shake&s;peare by the players of his time, that he never blotted out a line; and I believe without the ri&s;que of that retort which Ben Jon&s;on made to them, <Q REND="inline">'Would he had blotted out a thou&s;and.'</Q></P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance, worthy of notice, is, that in the portraits of &s;ingular characters, that occur in the papers written by John&s;on, the painting is &s;o &s;trong and lively, that &s;ome per&s;ons, then living, looking on them as re&s;emblances of them&s;elves, actually
<PB N="382" REF="387">
charged him with an intention to render them ridicu|lous, and were hardly appea&s;ed by his a&s;&s;urances that he copied no particular &s;ubject, but drew from arche|types which his ob&s;ervation had furni&s;hed, and his imagination had improved.</P>
<P>John&s;on was now become &s;o well known, and had by the Rambler, and other of his writings, given &s;uch evidences, not only of great abilities, and of his &s;kill in human life and manners, but of a &s;ociable and be|nevolent di&s;po&s;ition, that many became de&s;irous of his acquaintance, and to this they were farther tempted by the character he had acquired of delighting in conver&s;ation, and being free and communicative in his di&s;cour&s;e. He had removed, about the beginning of the year 1760, to chambers two doors down the Inner-Temple lane; and I have been told by his neighbour at the corner, that during the time he dwelt there, more enquiries were made at his &s;hop for Mr. John&s;on, than for all the inhabitants put toge|ther of both the Inner and Middle Temple. This circum&s;tance in his life leads me to mention, that Richard&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but in a le&s;s degree, the like powers of attraction, but they operated chiefly on young females, who, being de&s;irous of in&s;truction in the duties of life, were permitted by their parents and friends to vi&s;it and receive from him &s;uch le&s;&s;ons of prudence as he was ever ready and well qualified to give them; and it is well known, that many ingenious young women, who re&s;orted to his hou&s;e as to an aca|demy for tuition, became &s;o improved by his conver|&s;ation and his extemporary commentaries on his own writings, as afterwards to make a con&s;iderable figure
<PB N="383" REF="388">
in the literary world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See a poem in Fawkes and Woty's <Q REND="inline">'Poetical calendar,'</Q> intitled <Q REND="inline">'The Feminead,'</Q> written by the Rev.

And here let me ob&s;erve, that the benefits of oral in&s;truction, joined with the peru&s;al of &s;uch authors as we now put into female hands, may be e&s;timated by the degree of mental im|provement at which the &s;ex is at this day arrived, which, as John&s;on once remarked to me on receiving a lady's letter, is &s;o great, that in that kind of compo|&s;ition, we who were their teachers, may learn of them.</P>
<P>From this propen&s;ity to di&s;cur&s;ive communica|tion, in which John&s;on and Richard&s;on re&s;embled each other, nothing more is to be under&s;tood, than that both took plea&s;ure in that interchange of &s;enti|ments and opinions, which renders conver&s;ation in|&s;tructive and delightful, for, in other re&s;pects, they were men of very different endowments and tempers. Richard&s;on being bred to a mechanic occupation, had no learning, nor more reading than was &s;ufficient to enable him to form a &s;tyle ea&s;y and intelligible, and a little rai&s;ed above that of vulgar narrative. His &s;en|timents were his own, and of this he was &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and al&s;o of the originality and importance of many of them, that he would ever be talking of his writings, and the words &s;entiment and &s;entimentality became, not only a part of the cant of his &s;chool, but were adopted by &s;ucceeding writers, and have been u&s;ed to recom|mend to &s;ome readers &s;entimental journies, &s;entimen|tal letters, &s;entimental &s;ermons, and a world of tra&s;h,
<PB N="384" REF="389">
which, but for this &s;illy epithet, would never have at|tracted notice.</P>
<P>Richard&s;on's conver&s;ation was of the preceptive kind, but it wanted the diver&s;ity of John&s;on's, and had no intermixture of wit or humour. Richard&s;on could never relate a plea&s;ant &s;tory, and hardly reli&s;h one told by another: he was ever thinking of his own writings, and li&s;tening to the prai&s;es which, with an emulous profu&s;ion, his friends were ince&s;&s;antly be&s;tow|ing on them, he would &s;carce enter into free con|ver&s;ation with any one that he thought had not red <Q REND="inline">'Clari&s;&s;a,'</Q> or <Q REND="inline">'Sir Charles Grandi&s;on,'</Q> and at be&s;t, he could not be &s;aid to be a companionable man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I once travelled with him in the Fulham &s;tage-coach, in which, at my getting in, I found him &s;eated. I learned, by &s;omewhat he &s;zid to the coachman, who he was, and made &s;ome e&s;&s;ays towards conver&s;ation, but he &s;eemed di&s;inclined to any. There was one other pa&s;&s;enger, who being a female, I was, in common civility, bound to take notice of; but my male companion I left to indulge him&s;elf in a reverie, which neither he nor I interrupted by the utterance of a &s;ingle word, and la&s;ted till he was &s;et down at his hou&s;e on Par&s;on's green. He had the courte&s;y to a&s;k us in, but as our acquaintance had but lately commenced, and had received, but little improvement in our journey, the civility was declined.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were unacquainted with Richard&s;on, and had red his books, were led to believe, that they ex|hibited a picture of his own mind, and that his temper and dome&s;tic behaviour could not but corre&s;pond with that refined morality which they inculcate, but in this they were deceived. He was au&s;tere in the govern|ment of his family, and i&s;&s;ued his orders to &s;ome of his &s;ervants in writing only.

&s;eemed to me, in a vi&s;it I once made him, to have been di&s;ciplined in the &s;chool of Ben Jon&s;on's Mo|ro&s;e, who&s;e injunction to his &s;ervant was, <Q REND="inline">'An&s;wer me not but with your leg.'</Q> In &s;hort, they appeared to have been taught to conver&s;e with him by &s;igns; and it was too plain to me, that on his part, the mo&s;t frequent of them were frowns and ge&s;ticulations, im|porting that they &s;hould leave his pre&s;ence. I have heard it &s;aid, that he was what is called a nervous man; and how far nervo&s;ity, with &s;o good an under|&s;tanding as he is allowed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, will excu&s;e a conduct &s;o oppo&s;ite to that philanthropy which he laboured to inculcate, I cannot &s;ay: his benevolence might have taken another direction, and in other in|&s;tances be very &s;trong; for I was once a witne&s;s to his putting into the hand of Mr. Whi&s;ton the book|&s;eller, ten guineas for the relief of one whom a &s;udden accident had made a widow.</P>
<P>John&s;on's mind was never occupied on trifles: his &s;peculations were grand and noble, his reading various and exten&s;ive, and, on &s;ome &s;ubjects, profound.

Thus, in the Rambler, No. 1, he tells his readers, very gravely, that it is one among many rea&s;ons for which he pur|po&s;es to entertain his countrymen, that he hopes not much to tire tho&s;e whom he &s;hall not happen to plea&s;e, and if he is not commended for the beauty of his works, to be at lea&s;t pardoned for their brevity. <Q REND="inline">'But whether,' adds he, 'my expectations are mo&s;t fixed on pardon or prai&s;e, I think it not nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover.'&mdash;</Q>And in the Idler, No. 3, he &s;ugge&s;ts con&s;olation again&s;t the dread of an imaginary evil founded on fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, by admitting, that

<P>'Let us con&s;ider&mdash;can there be any thing wanting to complete this meditation on a pudding&mdash;if more

<P>He excelled al&s;o in the talent of burle&s;que ver&s;ifi|cation, and, upon occa&s;ion of a di&s;cour&s;e at Sir Jo&s;hua Reynold's on Dr. Percy's <Q REND="inline">'Reliques of ancient Eng|li&s;h poetry,'</Q> in which the beautiful &s;implicity of many of the ballads therein contained was remarked with &s;ome exaggeration, John&s;on contended, that what was called &s;implicity was, in truth, inanity; and, to illu&s;|trate his argument, and ridicule that kind of poetry, uttered the following impromptu:<Q><L>As with my hat upon my head,</L>
<L>I walk'd along the Strand,</L>
<L>I there did meet another man,</L>
<L>With his hat in his hand.</L></Q></P>
<P>And it being at a tea-conver&s;ation, he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Mi&s;s Reynolds, went on rhyming thus,<Q><LG>

<P>With the&s;e powers of in&s;tructing and delighting tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;ed, it is no wonder that the acquaintance of John&s;on was &s;ought by many; and I will not &s;ay, either that he &s;et &s;o great a value on his time, as not to be acce&s;&s;ible to all who wi&s;hed for the plea&s;ure of it, or that his vanity was not gratified by the vi&s;its of bi&s;hops, of courtiers, &s;enators, &s;cholars, travellers, and women.</P>
<P>In his conver&s;ation with the la&s;t in this enumera|tion, he had &s;uch a felicity as would put vulgar gal|lantry out of countenance. Of the female mind, he conceived a higher opinion than many men, and though he was never &s;u&s;pected of a blameable inti|macy with any individual of them, had a great e&s;teem for the &s;ex. The defect in his powers of &s;ight ren|dered him totally in&s;en&s;ible to the charms of beauty; but he knew that beauty was the attribute of the &s;ex, and treated all women with &s;uch an equable compla|cency, as flattered every one into a belief, that &s;he had her &s;hare of that or &s;ome more valuable endowment. In his di&s;cour&s;es with them, his compliments had ever a neat and elegant turn: they were never direct, but always implied the merit they were intended to at|te&s;t.</P>
<P>In this enjoyment of him&s;elf and his friends, his engagements to the public were forgotten: his cri|tical talents lay dormant, and not any, nor all of tho&s;e
<PB N="391" REF="396">
who wi&s;hed to &s;ee his Shake&s;peare, could rou&s;e his at|tention to the pro&s;ecution of that work; yet was he ready, at the call of almo&s;t any one, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, either by correction, or by a preface, or dedication, in the pub|lication of works not his own. Dr. Madden, &s;o well|known by his premiums for the encouragement of Prote&s;tant working-&s;chools in Ireland, and other in|&s;tances of beneficence in favour of that country, in the year 1745 publi&s;hed a panegyrical poem on arch bi&s;hop Boulter; &s;ome years after, being mind|ed to re-publi&s;h it, he &s;ubmitted it to John&s;on's correction, and I found among his books a copy of the poem, with a note, in a &s;pare leaf thereof, pur|porting, that the author had made him a vi&s;it, and, for a very few remarks and alterations of it, had pre&s;ented him with ten guineas. Such ca&s;ual emo|luments as the&s;e John&s;on frequently derived from his profe&s;&s;ion of an author. For the dedication to his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, of Adams's book on the u&s;e of the globes, he was, as him&s;elf informed me, gratified with a pre&s;ent of a very curious meteorological in|&s;trument, of a new and ingenious con&s;truction.</P>
<P>About this time, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, he, for &s;undry beneficed clergymen that reque&s;ted him, compo&s;ed pulpit di&s;cour&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The practice of preaching &s;ermons compo&s;ed by others is now become &s;o common, that many of the clergy &s;cruple not to avow it, and think them&s;elves ju&s;tified by the authority of Mr. Addi&s;on, who in one of his Spectators has very incautiou&s;ly given countenance thereto, and put into the mouths not only of &s;uch clergymen as are <HI>minus idonei,</HI> but of &s;uch as, contrary to their, engagement at their ordination, in&s;tead of being <HI>diligent in,</HI> are negligent of, <HI>&s;uch &s;tudies as help to the knowledge of the &s;criptures,</HI> a perpetual apology for ignorance and idlene&s;s; for, as long as they chu&s;e to &s;ay there are better di&s;cour&s;es extant, or to be procured, than they are able to make, the excu&s;e will hold them; and accordingly many are not a&s;hamed to claim the benefit of it, who have nothing to plead but what is an aggravation of their neglect; to which it may be added, that as it is an a&s;&s;umption of the merit of another, the practice is unju&s;t, and, as its leads to a belief of that which is not true, in a high degree immoral.</NOTE>, and for the&s;e, he made no &s;cruple of confe&s;&s;ing, he was paid: his price, I am informed, was a moderate one, a guinea; and &s;uch was his no|tion

of ju&s;tice, that having been paid, he con&s;idered them &s;o ab&s;olutely the property of the purcha&s;er, as to renounce all claim to them.

The next vi&s;it I made him, I told him that I had &s;een him at St. Margaret's on the preced|ing Sunday, and that it was he who then preached.

<P>I have now brought him to the year 1760, the fifty-fir&s;t of his age. He had nothing to depend on for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but the labour of his brain; and that apprehen&s;ion, touching the duration of his rational powers, which throughout his life haunted him, in|crea&s;ed the terrors of approaching age. The ac|ce&s;&s;ion of our pre&s;ent gracious &s;overeign to the throne, and the bounty exerci&s;ed by him to|wards John&s;on, di&s;pelled this gloomy pro&s;pect, and placed him in &s;uch a &s;tate of affluence as
<PB N="393" REF="398">
his utmo&s;t indu&s;try would hardly ever have enabled him to arrive at. Lord Bute was the mini&s;ter at the time; and the per&s;on employed to notify to John&s;on his maje&s;ty's intention to reward him for his literary labours with a pen&s;ion of 300l. a year, was his friend Mr. Murphy. Upon receiving the news, John&s;on was in doubt what an&s;wer to return, being, perhaps, di&s;turbed with the reflection, that whatever he might de&s;erve from the public, he had very little claim to the favour of any of the de&s;cendants of the hou&s;e of Hanover; and de&s;ired that Mr. Murphy would give him till next day to deliberate upon a me&s;&s;age &s;o unexpected. At the end thereof he &s;ignified his will|ingne&s;s to accept it.</P>
<P>It was by John&s;on and his friends thought fit, that he &s;hould return thanks for this di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the royal favour, and that lord Bute, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been in&s;trumental in procuring it, was the proper per&s;on to convey them. Accordingly, he waited on his lord&s;hip for the purpo&s;e, and, being admitted to him, te&s;tified his &s;en&s;e of the obligation; but having done this, he thought he had done enough, and never after could be prevailed on to knock at his door.</P>
<P>He had now &s;uffered him&s;elf to be enrolled in the li&s;t of pen&s;ioners, and was become obnoxious to the cen&s;ures of tho&s;e, who, looking upon a perpetual enmity to government and its mini&s;ters as a proof of public virtue, endeavoured to have it believed, that all favours di&s;pen&s;ed by the crown, even when meant as the rewards of merit, or the encouragement of learning, of ingenuity, or indu&s;try, were but the
<PB N="394" REF="399">
wages of iniquity. John&s;on, it is true, had laid him&s;elf open to reproach, by his interpretation of the word Pen&s;ion in his dictionary, written, it is evident, at a time when his political prejudices were &s;tronge&s;t, and he found him&s;elf in a predicament &s;imilar to that of Dr. Sherlock, who, at the revolution, was a non|juror to king William, but, after deliberating on his refu&s;al as a ca&s;e of con&s;cience, took the &s;ide that made for his intere&s;t, but again&s;t his reputation. But who, except the Great Searcher of Hearts, can know, that in the ca&s;e of Sherlock or John&s;on, either made a &s;acrifice of his con&s;cience? Or, &s;eeing that the grant of John&s;on's pen&s;ion was confe&s;&s;edly unconditional, and bound him neither to the renunciation of any of his political principles, nor the exerci&s;e of his pen in the defence of any &s;et of men or &s;eries of mea&s;ures, who will have the face to &s;ay, that his acceptance of it was criminal, or that it was in the power of any one to pervert the integrity of a man, who, in the time of his nece&s;&s;ity, had, from &s;cruples of his own rai&s;ing, declined the offer of a valuable eccle&s;ia&s;tical prefer|ment, and thereby renounced an independent provi&s;ion for the whole of his life?</P>
<P>It is yet difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to ju&s;tify John|&s;on, both in the interpretation given by him of the word Pen&s;ion, and in his becoming a pen&s;ioner: in one in&s;tance or the other he was wrong, and either his di&s;cretion or integrity mu&s;t be given up: in the former, he &s;eems, in &s;ome of his actions, to have been wanting, in the latter never: not only charity, but rea&s;on, therefore, directs us in the opinion we are to form of an act which has drawn cen&s;ure on his con|duct,
<PB N="395" REF="400">
and proves nothing more than that he was not equally wi&s;e at all times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some of John&s;on's friends, and all his enemies, would have been glad had he imitated the conduct of Andrew Marvell, who, in the reign of Cha. II. upon the offer of any po&s;t under the go|vernment that would plea&s;e him, and of a thou&s;and pounds in money, made him in a me&s;&s;age from the king by the earl of Danby at a time when he wanted a guinea, refu&s;ed both. But John&s;on had no rea&s;on to practice &s;uch &s;elf-denial. Marvell, to be grateful, mu&s;t have de&s;erted his principles, and acquie&s;ced in the mea&s;ures of a corrupt court. John&s;on, on the contrary, was in no danger, during &s;uch a reign as is the pre&s;ent, of being required to make a &s;acrifice of his con&s;cience, and, being thus at liberty, he accepted the bounty of his &s;overeign.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The addition of three hundred pounds a year, to what John&s;on was able to earn by the ordinary exer|ci&s;e of his talents, rai&s;ed him to a &s;tate of comparative affluence, and afforded him the means of a&s;&s;i&s;ting many who&s;e real or pretended wants had formerly excited his compa&s;&s;ion. He now practi&s;ed a rule which he often recommended to his friends, always to go abroad with a quantity of loo&s;e money to give to beggars, imitating therein, though I am confident without intending it, that good but weak man, old Mr. Whi&s;ton, whom I have &s;een di&s;tributing, in the &s;treets of London, money to beggars on each hand of him, till his pocket was nearly exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>He had, early in his life, been a dabbler in phy&s;ic, and laboured under &s;ome &s;ecret bodily infirmities that gave him occa&s;ion once to &s;ay to me, that he knew not what it was to be totally free from pain. He now drew into a clo&s;er intimacy with him a man, with whom he had been acquainted from the year 1746, one of the lowe&s;t practitioners in the art of
<PB N="396" REF="401">
healing that ever &s;ought a livelihood by it: him he con&s;ulted in all that related to his health, and made &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to him as hardly to be able to live without him.</P>
<P>The name of this per&s;on was Robert Levett. An account of him is given in the Gentleman's Magazine for February 1785: an earlier than that, I have now lying before me, in a letter from a per&s;on in the country to John&s;on, written in an&s;wer to one in which he had de&s;ired to be informed of &s;ome particulars re&s;pecting his friend Levett, then lately decea&s;ed. The &s;ub&s;tance of this information is as follows:</P>
<P>He was born at Kirk Ella, a pari&s;h about five miles di&s;tant from Hull, and lived with his parents till about twenty years of age. He had acquired &s;ome knowledge of the Latin language, and had a propen|&s;ity to learning, which his parents not being able to gratify, he went to live as a &s;hopman with a woollen|draper at Hull: with him he &s;tayed two years, during which time he learned from a neighbour of his ma&s;ter &s;omewhat of the practice of phy&s;ic: at the end thereof he came to London, with a view po&s;&s;ibly to improve him&s;elf in that profe&s;&s;ion; but by &s;ome &s;trange acci|dent was led to pur&s;ue another cour&s;e, and became &s;teward or &s;ome other upper &s;ervant to the then lord Cardigan, [or Cadogan] and having &s;aved &s;ome mo|ney, he took a re&s;olution to travel, and vi&s;ited France and Italy for the purpo&s;e, as his letters mention, of gaining experience in phy&s;ic, and, returning to Lon|don with a valuable library which he had collected abroad, placed one of his brothers apprentice to a mathematical-in&s;trument maker, and provided for the education of another. After this he went to Paris,
<PB N="397" REF="402">
and, for improvement, attended the ho&s;pitals in that city. At the end of five years he returned to Eng|land, and taking lodgings in the hou&s;e of an attorney in Northumberland court, near Charing cro&s;s, he be|came a practicer of phy&s;ic. The letter adds, that he was about &s;eventy-eight at the time of his death.</P>
<P>The account of Levett in the Gentleman's Maga|zine is anonymous; I neverthele&s;s in&s;ert it verbatim, together with a letter of John&s;on's to Dr. Lawrence notifying his death.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'Mr. Levett, though an Engli&s;hman by birth, be|came early in life a waiter at a coffee-hou&s;e in Paris. The &s;urgeons who frequented it, finding him of an inqui&s;itive turn, and attentive to their conver&s;ation, made a pur&s;e for him, and gave him &s;ome in&s;truc|tions in their art. They afterwards furni&s;hed him with the means of other knowledge, by procuring him free admi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch lectures in pharmacy and anatomy as were read by the able&s;t profe&s;&s;ors of that period. Hence his introduction to a bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which afforded him a continual, though &s;len|der maintenance. Where the middle part of his life was &s;pent, is uncertain. He re&s;ided, however, above twenty years under the roof of John&s;on, who never wi&s;hed him to be regarded as an inferior, or treated him like a dependent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on has frequently ob&s;erved, that Levett was indebted to him for nothing more than hou&s;e-room, his &s;hare in a penny loaf at breakfa&s;t, and now and then a dinner on a Sunday.</NOTE>. He breakfa&s;ted with the doctor every morning, and perhaps was &s;een no more by him till mid-night. Much of the day was em|ployed in attendance on his patients, who were
<PB N="398" REF="403">
chiefly of the lowe&s;t rank of trade&s;men. The re|mainder of his hours he dedicated to Hunter's lectures, and to as many different opportunities of improvement as he could meet with on the &s;ame gratuitous conditions. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All his medical know|ledge," &s;aid John&s;on, "and it is not incon&s;iderable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had acted for many years in the capacity of &s;urgeon and apothecary to John&s;on, under the direction of Dr. Lawrence.</NOTE>, was obtained through the ear.

It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to add, that both parties were di&s;appointed in their views. If Levett took her for an heire&s;s, who in time might be rich, &s;he regarded him as a phy&s;ician already in con&s;iderable practice.&mdash;Compared with the marvels of this tran&s;action, as John&s;on him&s;elf declared when relating them, the tales in the Arabian Nights' Entertainments &s;eem familiar occurrences.

In a &s;hort time afterwards, &s;he ran away
<PB N="399" REF="404">
from him, and was tried, providentially, in his opi|nion, for picking pockets at the Old Bailey. Her hu&s;band was, with difficulty, prevented from attend|ing the court, in the hope &s;he would be hanged. She pleaded her own cau&s;e, and was acquitted; a &s;epara|tion between this ill-&s;tarred couple took place; and Dr. John&s;on then took Levett home, where he con|tinued till his death, which happened &s;uddenly, with|out pain, Jan. 17, 1782. His vanity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that a young woman of family and fortune &s;hould be enamoured of him, Dr. John&s;on thought, de&s;erved &s;ome check.&mdash;As no relations of his were known to Dr. John&s;on, he adverti&s;ed for them. In the cour&s;e of a few weeks an heir at law appeared, and a&s;cer|tained his title to what effects the decea&s;ed had left behind him.</P><P>'Levett's character was rendered valuable by re|peated proof of hone&s;ty, tenderne&s;s, and gratitude to his benefactor, as well as by an unwearied diligence in his profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;His &s;ingle failing was, an occa&s;i|onal departure from &s;obriety. John&s;on would ob|&s;erve, he was, perhaps, the only man who ever be|came intoxicated through motives of prudence. He reflected, that if he refu&s;ed the gin or brandy offered him by &s;ome of his patients, he could have been no gainer by their cure, as they might have had nothing el&s;e to be&s;tow on him. This habit of taking a fee, in whatever &s;hape it was exhibited, could not be put off by advice or admonition of any kind. He would &s;wallow what he did not like, nay, what he knew would injure him, rather than go home with an idea, that his &s;kill had been exerted without recompence. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Had (&s;aid

<P>To this character I here add as a &s;upplement to it, a dictum of John&s;on re&s;pecting Levett, viz. that his external appearance and behaviour were &s;uch, that he di&s;gu&s;ted the rich, and terrified the poor.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e offen&s;ive particulars, John&s;on, who&s;e credulity in &s;ome in&s;tances was as great as his incredulity in others, conceived of him as of a &s;kilful medical profe&s;&s;or, and thought him&s;elf

happy in having &s;o near his per&s;on one who was to him, not &s;olely a phy&s;ician, a &s;urgeon, or an apothe|cary, but all. In extraordinary ca&s;es he, however, availed him&s;elf of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his valued friend Dr. Lawrence, a man of whom, in re&s;pect of his piety, learning, and &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, it may almo&s;t be &s;aid, the world was not worthy, ina&s;much as it &s;uffered his talents, for the whole of his life, to re|main, in a great mea&s;ure, unemployed, and him&s;elf to end his days in &s;orrow and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Of this per&s;on, with whom I was for many years ac|quainted, but who is now no more, gratitude for the benefits which my&s;elf and one mo&s;t dear to me have derived from his &s;kill and attention, obliges me to &s;peak with reverence and re&s;pect. He was a native of Hamp&s;hire, and having ended his &s;tudies at Oxford, came to London about the year 1737, at which time Dr. Frank Nicholls had attained great reputation for &s;kill in anatomy. To complete them, he became a pu|pil of his, in that branch of medical &s;cience, and upon Nicholls's di&s;continuing to read lectures therein, which he had for &s;everal years done with great applau&s;e, Dr. Lawrence took them up, and had many hearers, till Hunter, a &s;urgeon, arrived from Scotland, who, &s;et|tling in London, became his rival in the &s;ame practice, and having the advantage of Dr. Lawrence, in his manner of enunciating, together with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport of all his countrymen in this kingdom, and moreover, being a man who&s;e &s;kill in his art was equal to his preten&s;ions, he became a favourite with the leading men in the practice of phy&s;ic, and in a few winters drew to him &s;uch a re&s;ort of pupils, as in|duced
<PB N="402" REF="407">
Dr. Lawrence to give up lecturing, and betake him&s;elf to the general exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In his endeavours to attain to eminence, it was his misfortune to fail: he was above tho&s;e arts by which popularity is acquired, and had be&s;ides &s;ome per&s;onal defects and habits which &s;tood in his way; a vacuity of countenance very unfavourable to an opinion of his learning or &s;agacity, and certain convul&s;ive motions of the head and features that gave pain to the behold|ers, and drew off attention to all that he &s;aid<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will hardly be believed, how much &s;uch particularities as the&s;e, ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of one who is to make his way in a profe&s;&s;ion: a &s;tammering, or a bad articulation, &s;poil an orator, and a di&s;gu&s;ting appearance hurts a phy&s;ician.

<P>He delighted much in naval architecture, and was able with his own hands, and a variety of tools of his own contrivance, to form a model of a &s;hip of war of any rate; fir&s;t framing it with ribs and &s;uch other timbers as are requi&s;ite in a &s;hip for &s;ervice, and afterwards covering it with planks of the thickne&s;s of a half-crown piece, and the breadth of about an inch, which he fa&s;tened to the ribs with wooden pins of a proportionable &s;ize, and in this manner of working he completed many &s;uch models, elegantly wrought and mo&s;t beautiful in their forms.

About the year 1740, I was u&s;ed to meet both the brothers at a tavern in Gracechurch &s;treet, where was a private concert, to which none but &s;uch as could join in it were admitted. Many of tho&s;e who frequented it were great ma&s;ters, namely, Mr. Stanley, who played the fir&s;t violin, the above Sig.

that came upon him about the middle of his life, and at length drove him to &s;eek a retreat from the world and all its cares at Canterbury, where, about the year 1783, he died. To con&s;ole him under &s;ome family di&s;appointments, John&s;on addre&s;&s;ed to him a fine Latin ode, which is in&s;erted in his works.</P>
<P>He wrote the life of his friend Dr. Nicholls, in very elegant Latin, but it was never publi&s;hed: his &s;ole de&s;ign in printing it being to gratify tho&s;e of his own profe&s;&s;ion. In the &s;ame language, he wrote the life of Dr. William Harvey, prefixed to an edition of his works, publi&s;hed by the college of phy&s;icians in 1766, in one volume 4to.</P>
<P>The &s;incere and la&s;ting friend&s;hip, that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between John&s;on and Levett, may &s;erve to &s;hew, that although a &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;itions and qualities has a tendency to beget affection, or &s;omething very nearly re&s;embling it, it may be contracted and &s;ub&s;i&s;t where this inducement is wanting; for hardly were ever two men le&s;s like each other, in this re&s;pect, than were they. Levett had not an under&s;tanding capable of compre|hending the talents of John&s;on: the mind of John|&s;on was therefore, as to him, a blank; and John&s;on, had the eye of his mind been more penetrating than it
<PB N="404" REF="409">
was, could not di&s;cern, what did not exi&s;t, any par|ticulars in Levett's character that at all re&s;embled his own. He had no learning, and con&s;equently was an unfit companion for a learned man; and though it may be &s;aid, that having lived &s;ome years abroad, he mu&s;t have &s;een and remarked many things that would have afforded entertainment in the relation, this advantage was counterbalanced by an utter inability for continued conver&s;ation, taciturnity being one of the mo&s;t obvious features in his character: the con|&s;ideration of all which particulars almo&s;t impels me to &s;ay, that Levett admired John&s;on becau&s;e others admired him, and that John&s;on in pity loved Levett, becau&s;e few others could find any thing in him to love.</P>
<P>And here I cannot forbear remarking, that, almo&s;t throughout his life, poverty and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tan|ces &s;eemed to be the &s;tronge&s;t of all recommendations to his favour. When a&s;ked by one of his mo&s;t inti|mate friends, how he could bear to be &s;urrounded by &s;uch nece&s;&s;itous and unde&s;erving people as he had about him, his an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">'If I did not a&s;&s;i&s;t them no one el&s;e would, and they mu&s;t be lo&s;t for want.'</Q> Among many others, whom he thus patronized, was a worthle&s;s fellow, a dancing-ma&s;ter by profe&s;&s;ion, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in teaching to the famous Noverre the favourite of Mr. Garrick. This man, notwith&s;tanding the nature of his employment, which was a genteel one, and led to no &s;uch connections, delighted in the company and conver&s;ation of mar&s;hal's-court attornies, and of bailiffs and their followers, and others of a lower cla&s;s, &s;harpers and &s;windlers, who, when they had made
<PB N="405" REF="410">
him drunk, would get him to &s;ign notes and engage|ments of various kinds, which, he not being able to di&s;charge, they had him arre&s;ted upon, and this was &s;o frequently the ca&s;e, that much of his time was pa&s;&s;ed in confinement. His wife, through Mrs. Wil|liams, got at John&s;on, and told him her tale, which was, that her hu&s;band was, at that in&s;tant, detained for a &s;mall debt in a &s;punging-hou&s;e, and he conceiving it to be a piteous one, and an additional proof that in human life the evil accidents outnumber the good, &s;ent her to me for advice. I heard her &s;tory, and learned from it, that all the merit of the fellow lay in his heels, that he had neither principle nor di&s;cretion, and, in &s;hort, was a cully, the dupe of every one that would make him drunk. I therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her with a me&s;&s;age to John&s;on to this effect: that her hu&s;band made it impo&s;&s;ible for his friends to help him, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his de&s;tiny. When I next &s;aw John&s;on, I told him that there &s;eemed to be as exact a fitne&s;s between the character of this man and his a&s;&s;o|ciates, as is between the web of a &s;pider and the wings of a fly, and I could not but think he was born to be cheated. John&s;on &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce in my opinion; but I believe, before that, had &s;et him at liberty by paying the debt.</P>
<P>Another of John&s;on's di&s;tre&s;&s;ed friends was, Mr. Edmund Southwell, a younger brother of Thomas lord Southwell, of the kingdom of Ireland. This gentleman, having no patrimony, was, in his younger days, a cornet of hor&s;e; but having in a duel, into which he was forced, &s;lain his antagoni&s;t, he quitted the &s;ervice, and tru&s;ted to Providence for a &s;upport.
<PB N="406" REF="411">
He was a man of wonderful parts, of lively and en|tertaining conver&s;ation, and well acquainted with the world; he was al&s;o a brother in affliction with John|&s;on, that is to &s;ay, he laboured under a depre&s;&s;ion or mind, occa&s;ioned by the mi&s;adventure above-men|tioned, that often approached to in&s;anity. Being without employment, his practice was to wander about the &s;treets of London, and call in at &s;uch coffee-hou&s;es, for in&s;tance, the Smyrna and Cocoa|tree in Pall-Mall, and Child's and Bat&s;on's in the city, as were frequented by men of intelligence, or where any thing like conver&s;ation was going forward: in the&s;e he found means to make friends, from whom he derived a precarious &s;upport. In the city he was &s;o well known, and &s;o much beloved and pitied, that many, by private donations, relieved his wants. In particular, Sir Robert Ladbroke, an alderman thereof, and a man of opulence, made him frequent pre&s;ents of money to &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities, and Mr. Bates, the ma&s;ter of the Queen's-arms tavern in St. Paul's church-yard, &s;uffered him, as often as he plea&s;ed, to add to an ideal account &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, the expence of a dinner. A gentleman of great worth in the city, who knew and pitied his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, procured, unknown to him, from a lady famous for her beneficence, a pen&s;ion of a hundred pounds a year, which he lived but few years to receive.</P>
<P>John&s;on was a great lover of penitents, and of all &s;uch men as, in their conver&s;ation, made profe&s;&s;ions of piety; of this man he would &s;ay, that he was one of the mo&s;t pious of all his acquaintance, but in this, as he frequently was in the judgment he formed of
<PB N="407" REF="412">
others, he was mi&s;taken. It is po&s;&s;ible that South|well might, in his conver&s;ation, expre&s;s &s;uch &s;enti|ments of religion and moral obligation, as &s;erved to &s;hew that he was not an infidel, but he &s;eldom went &s;ober to bed, and as &s;eldom ro&s;e from it be|fore noon.</P>
<P>He was al&s;o an admirer of &s;uch as he thought well-bred men. What was his notion of good breed|ing ould never learn. If it was not courte&s;y and affability, it could to him be nothing; for he was an incompetent judge of graceful attitudes and motions, and of the ritual of behaviour. Of lord Southwell, the brother of the above per&s;on, and of Tom Hervey, a profligate, worthle&s;s man, the author of the letter to Sir Thomas Hanmer, and who had nothing in his external appearance that could in the lea&s;t re|commend him, he was u&s;ed to &s;ay, they were each of them a model for the fir&s;t man of quality in the kingdom. In this method of e&s;timating beha|viour, he &s;eemed to think that good-breeding is a faculty, which, like fencing, dancing, and other bodily exerci&s;es, mu&s;t be learned before they can be practi&s;ed; whereas, it is obvious, that this quality is nothing more than artificial benevolence, and that that politene&s;s, which it is the employment of the in|&s;tructors of youth to teach, is but a &s;ub&s;titute for tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of mind, which, whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and takes care to cultivate, will have very little need of foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the forming of his man|ners.</P>
<P>He once mentioned to me a &s;aying of Dr. Nicholls, and highly commended it, viz. that it
<PB N="408" REF="413">
was a point of wi&s;dom to form intimacies, and to choo&s;e for our friends only per&s;ons of known worth and integrity, and that to do &s;o had been the rule of his life. It is, therefore, difficult to account for the conduct of John&s;on in the choice of many of his a&s;&s;ociates, and particularly of tho&s;e who, when his circum&s;tances became ea&s;y, he &s;uffered to intrude on him. Of the&s;e he had &s;ome at bed and board, who had elbowed through the world, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by lying, begging, and &s;hifting, all which he knew, but &s;eemed to think never the wor&s;e of them. In his endeavours to promote the intere&s;ts of people of this cla&s;s, he, in &s;ome in&s;tances, went &s;uch lengths as were hardly con&s;i&s;tent with that integrity, which he manife&s;ted on all other occa&s;ions; for he would fre|quently, by letters, recommend tho&s;e to credit, who could obtain it by no other means, and thereby enabled them to contract debts, which he had good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, they neither could nor ever would pay.</P>
<P>The&s;e connections expo&s;ed him to trouble and in|ce&s;&s;ant &s;olicitation, which he bore well enough, but his inmates were enemies to his peace, and occa&s;ioned him great di&s;quiet: the jealou&s;y that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among them rendered his dwelling irk&s;ome to him, and he &s;eldom approached it, after an evening's conver&s;ation abroad, but with the dread of finding it a &s;cene of di&s;cord, and of having his ears filled with the com|plaints of Mrs. Williams of Frank's neglect of his duty and inattention to the intere&s;ts of his ma&s;ter, and of Frank again&s;t Mrs. Williams, for the autho|rity &s;he a&s;&s;umed over him, and exerci&s;ed with an un|warrantable &s;everity. Even tho&s;e intruders who had
<PB N="409" REF="414">
taken &s;helter under his roof, and who, in his ab&s;ence from home, brought thither their children, found cau&s;e to murmur; their provi&s;ion of food was &s;canty, or their dinners ill dre&s;&s;ed; all which he cho&s;e to en|dure rather than put an end to their clamours, by rid|ding his hou&s;e of &s;uch thankle&s;s and trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts. Nay, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible was he of the ingratitude of tho&s;e whom he &s;uffered thus to hang on him, and among whom he may be &s;aid to have divided an income which was little more than &s;ufficient for his own &s;up|port, that he would &s;ubmit to reproach and per&s;onal affront from &s;ome of them, even Levett would &s;ome|times in&s;ult him, and Mrs. Williams, in her paroxy&s;ms of rage, has been known to drive him from her pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Who, that reflects on John&s;on's pu&s;illanimity in the&s;e in&s;tances, can reconcile it to that &s;pirit which prompted him, or with tho&s;e endowments which ena|bled him to maintain a &s;uperiority over all with whom he conver&s;ed? or to that &s;eeming ferocity of temper that gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome to con&s;ider him as an animal not to be approached without terror? or account for the incon&s;i&s;tency above-noted, otherwi&s;e than by re&s;olving it into tho&s;e principles that dictated patience, under all the provocations of a female tongue, to Socrates? In truth, there was more a&s;perity in his manner of expre&s;&s;ion than in his natural di&s;po&s;ition; for I have heard that, in many in&s;tances, and in &s;ome with tears in his eyes, he has apologized to tho&s;e whom he had of|fended by contradiction or roughne&s;s of behaviour.</P>
<P>To this incon&s;i&s;tency of character it mu&s;t be im|puted, that he failed to attract reverence and re&s;pect
<PB N="410" REF="415">
from tho&s;e who lived in greate&s;t intimacy with him. There was wanting in his conduct and behaviour that dignity, which re&s;ults from a regular and orderly cour&s;e of action, and, by an irre&s;i&s;tible power, commands e&s;teem. He could not be &s;aid to be a &s;tayed man, nor &s;o to have adju&s;ted in his mind the balance of rea&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion, as to give occa&s;ion to &s;ay what may be ob&s;erved of &s;ome men, that all they do is ju&s;t, fit, and right: and although he was &s;trict, and even punctilious, in the practice of the great duties of morality, he tru&s;ted but little to his dome&s;tic conduct, to his method of employing his time, and governing his family, for the good opinion he wi&s;hed the world to entertain of him, but, in the&s;e particulars, gave way to the love of ea&s;e, and to &s;elf-indulgence, little regarding, in his own practice, tho&s;e coun&s;els of prudence, tho&s;e oeconomical max|ims, and tho&s;e reflections on the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, with which his writings abound. To a lady, who &s;ignified a great de&s;ire to increa&s;e her acquaintance with authors, conceiving that more might be learned from their conver&s;ation and manner of living, than from their works&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Madam,' &s;aid he, 'the be&s;t part of an author will always be found in his writings.'&mdash;</Q>And to a per&s;on, who once &s;aid he paid little regard to tho&s;e writers on religion or morality, who&s;e practice corre&s;ponded not with their precepts, he imputed a want of knowledge of mankind, &s;aying, it was gro&s;s ignorance in him not to know, that good principles and an irregular life were con&s;i&s;tent with each other.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ecret which, without much mi&s;chief, might have been revealed in conver&s;ation, but John|&s;on

The above facts and ob&s;ervations are meant to &s;hew &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous features and foibles in John&s;on's character, and go to prove, not only that his ferocity was not &s;o terrific, as that any one endued with temper, and di&s;po&s;ed to moderation and forbear|ance, might not only with&s;tand, but overcome it, but that he had a natural imbecillity about him, ari&s;ing from humanity and pity to the &s;ufferings of his fellow|creatures, that was prejudicial to his intere&s;ts; and al&s;o, that he neither &s;ought nor expected prai&s;e for tho&s;e acts of beneficence which he was daily performing, nor looked for any retribution from tho&s;e who were nouri&s;h|ed by his bounty. Indeed, they were &s;uch creatures as were incapable of being awed by a &s;en&s;e of his worth, or of di&s;cerning the motives that actuated him; they were people of the lowe&s;t and vulgare&s;t minds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of &s;uch, lord Bacon ob&s;erves, that <Q REND="inline">'the lowe&s;t virtues draw prai&s;e from them, the middle work in them a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration; but of the higher virtues they have no &s;en&s;e or perceiving.' <BIBL>E&s;&s;ay on Prai&s;e.</BIBL></Q></P> </NOTE>, whom idlene&s;s had made poor, and liberality impudent, and what is to be expected from &s;uch, is known to all that are, in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, acquainted with the world; and la&s;tly, they &s;hew his method of accounting for that manife&s;t and &s;triking contrariety which, as he &s;ays, has been often ob&s;erved, between the life of an author and his writings.</P>

The hi&s;tory of learning furni&s;hes us with many ex|amples of men who have deviated from the &s;tudy of polite literature to that of the hermetic &s;cience, or, in plainer Engli&s;h, to that &s;ublimer chemi&s;try which leads to the tran&s;mutation of metals; and tho&s;e, who may have heard that John&s;on exerci&s;ed him&s;elf in chemical proce&s;&s;es, may perhaps think, that his view therein was &s;uddenly to become the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of immen&s;e riches, but I am able to obviate this &s;u&s;picion, and a&s;&s;ure them, that his motive thereto was only curio|&s;ity, and his end mere amu&s;ement. At the time he frequented the club in Ivy lane, Dyer was going through a cour&s;e of chemi&s;try under Dr. Pemberton, of Gre&s;ham college, and would &s;ometimes give us &s;uch de&s;criptions of proce&s;&s;es as were very entertain|ing, particularly to John&s;on, who would li&s;ten to them attentively. We may &s;uppo&s;e, that in the cour&s;e of his reading, he had acquired &s;ome know|ledge of the theory of the art, and that he wi&s;hed for an opportunity of reducing that knowledge into practice: he thought that time now come, and though he had no fitter an apartment for a laboratory than the garret over his chambers in the Inner Temple, he furni&s;hed that with an alembic, with retorts, re|ceivers, and other ve&s;&s;els adapted to the cheape&s;t and lea&s;t opero&s;e proce&s;&s;es. What his aims were, at fir&s;t, I know not, having forgotten the account he once gave me of the earlie&s;t of his chemical operations; but I have &s;ince learned, that they dwindled down to mere di&s;tillation, and that from &s;ub&s;tances of the &s;imple&s;t and coar&s;e&s;t &s;ort, namely, peppermint, and the dregs of &s;trong beer, from the latter whereof he
<PB N="415" REF="420">
was able to extract a &s;trong but very nau&s;eous &s;pirit, which all might &s;mell, but few cho&s;e to ta&s;te.</P>
<P>John&s;on had now con&s;iderably extended the circle of his acquaintance, and added to the number of his friends &s;undry per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence: among them were, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Edmund Burke, Mr. Beauclerk, and Mr. Langton. With the&s;e he pa&s;&s;ed much of his time, and was de&s;irous of being &s;till clo&s;er connected. How much he delighted in convivial meetings, how he loved conver&s;ation, and how &s;en&s;ibly he felt the attractions of a tavern, has already been mentioned; and it was but a natural con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, that he &s;hould wi&s;h for frequent opportunities of indulging them in a way that would free him from dome&s;tic re&s;traints, from the ob&s;ervance of hours, and a conformity to the re|gimen of families. A tavern was the place for the&s;e enjoyments, and a weekly club was in&s;tituted for his gratification and the mutual entertainment and delight of its &s;everal members. The fir&s;t movers in this a&s;&s;o|ciation were John&s;on and Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds: the number of per&s;ons included in it was nine: the place of meeting was the Turk's head in Gerrard &s;treet; the day Monday in every week, and the hour of a&s;&s;embling &s;even in the evening. To this a&s;&s;ociation I had the honour of being invited. The members were,<LIST>

<P>As &s;ome of the per&s;ons above-mentioned are hap|pily

yet living, and are too eminently known to re|ceive honour from any thing I am able to &s;ay of them, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with giving the characters of &s;uch of them as are now no more.</P>
<P>Dr. Nugent was a phy&s;ician, of the Romi&s;h com|munion, and ri&s;ing into practice with per&s;ons of that per&s;ua&s;ion. He was an ingenious, &s;en&s;ible, and learned man, of ea&s;y conver&s;ation, and elegant manners. John&s;on had a high opinion of him, and always &s;poke of him in terms of great re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Gold&s;mith is well known by his writings to have been a man of genius and of very fine parts; but of his character and general deportment, it is the harde&s;t ta&s;k any one can undertake to give a de&s;cription. I will, however, attempt it, tru&s;ting to be excu&s;ed if, in the &s;pirit of a faithful hi&s;torian, I record as well his &s;ingularities as his merits.</P>
<P>There are certain memoirs of him extant, from which we learn, that his inclination, co-operating with his fortunes which were but &s;canty, led him into a cour&s;e of life little differing from vagrancy, that deprived him of the benefits of regular &s;tudy: it however gratified his humour, &s;tored his mind with ideas and &s;ome knowledge, which, when he became &s;ettled, he improved by various reading; yet, to all the graces of urbanity he was a &s;tranger. With the greate&s;t preten&s;ions to poli&s;hed manners he was rude, and, when he mo&s;t meant the contrary, ab&s;urd. He affected John&s;on's &s;tyle and manner of conver&s;ation, and, when he had uttered, as he often would, a laboured &s;entence, &s;o tumid as to be &s;carce intel|ligible, would a&s;k, if that was not truly John&s;onian; yet he loved not John&s;on, but rather envied him for
<PB N="417" REF="422">
his parts; and once intreated a friend to de&s;i&s;t from prai&s;ing him, <Q REND="inline">'for in doing &s;o', &s;aid he, 'you harrow up my very &s;oul.'</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;ome wit, but no humour, and never told a &s;tory but he &s;poiled it. The following anecdotes will convey &s;ome idea of the &s;tyle and manner of his conver&s;ation:</P>
<P>He was u&s;ed to &s;ay he could play on the German|flute as well as mo&s;t men;&mdash;at other times, as well as any man living; and in his poem of the Travel|ler, has hinted at this attainment in the following lines:
<Q><L>To kinder &s;kies, where gentler manners reign,</L>
<L>I turn; and France di&s;plays her bright domain:</L>
<L>Gay &s;prightly land of mirth and &s;ocial ea&s;e,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with thy&s;elf, whom all the world can plea&s;e,</L>
<L>How often have I led thy &s;portive choir,</L>
<L>With tunele&s;s pipe, be&s;ide the murmuring Loire!</L>
<L>Where &s;hading elms along the margin grew,</L>
<L>And, fre&s;hen'd from the wave, the zephyr flew;</L>
<L>And haply, though my har&s;h touch, falt'ring &s;till,</L>
<L>But mock'd all tune, and marr'd the dancers &s;kill,</L>
<L>Yet would the village prai&s;e my wond'rous power,</L>
<L>And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.</L></Q>
But, in truth, he under&s;tood not the character in which mu&s;ic is written, and played on that in&s;trument, as many of the vulgar do, merely by ear. Roubiliac the &s;culptor, a merry fellow, once heard him play, and minding to put a trick on him, pretended to be charmed with his performance, as al&s;o, that him&s;elf was &s;killed in the art, and intreated him to repeat the air, that he might write it down. Gold&s;mith readily con&s;enting, Roubiliac called for paper, and &s;cored
<PB N="418" REF="423">
thereon a few five-lined &s;taves, which having done, Gold&s;mith proceeded to play, and Roubiliac to write; but his writing was only &s;uch random notes on the lines and &s;paces as any one might &s;et down who had ever in&s;pected a page of mu&s;ic. When they had both done, Roubiliac &s;hewed the paper to Gold&s;mith, who looking it over with &s;eeming great attention, &s;aid it was very correct, and that if he had not &s;een him do it, he never could have believed his friend capable of writing mu&s;ic after him.</P>
<P>He would frequently preface a &s;tory thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I'll now tell you a &s;tory of my&s;elf, which &s;ome people laugh at, and &s;ome do not.'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>At the breaking up of an evening at a tavern, he intreated the company to &s;it down, and told them if they would call for another bottle they &s;hould hear one of his bons mots:&mdash;they agreed, and he began thus:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I was once told that Sheridan the player, in order to improve him&s;elf in &s;tage-ge&s;tures, had looking-gla&s;&s;es, to the number of ten, hung about his room, and that he practi&s;ed before them; upon which I &s;aid, then there were ten ugly fellows toge|ther.'&mdash;</Q>The company were all &s;ilent: he a&s;ked why they did not laugh, which they not doing, he, with|out ta&s;ting the wine, left the room in anger.</P>
<P>He once complained to a friend in the&s;e words:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Mr. Martinelli is a rude man: I &s;aid in his hearing, that there were no good writers among the Italians, and he &s;aid to one that &s;at near him, that I was very ignorant<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Martinelli is an Italian.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'People,' &s;aid he, 'are greatly mi&s;taken in me: a notion goes about, that when I am &s;ilent I mean to

<P>Having one day a call to wait on the late duke, then earl, of Northumberland, I found Gold&s;mith waiting for an audience in an outer room; I a&s;ked him what had brought him there: he told me an invitation from his lord&s;hip. I made my bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;hort as I could, and, as a rea&s;on, mentioned, that Dr. Gold&s;mith was waiting without. The earl a&s;ked me if I was acquainted with him: I told him I was, adding what I thought likely to recommend him. I retired, and &s;taid in the outer room to take him home. Upon his coming out, I a&s;ked him the re&s;ult of his conver&s;ation:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'His lord&s;hip,' &s;ays he, 'told me he had red my poem,' meaning the Tra|veller, 'and was much delighted with it; that he was going lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and that, hearing that I was a native of that country, he &s;hould be glad to do me any kindne&s;s.'&mdash;</Q>And what did you an&s;wer, a&s;ked I, to this gracious offer?&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Why,' &s;aid he, 'I could &s;ay nothing but that I had a brother there, a clergyman, that &s;tood in need of help: as for my&s;elf, I have no dependence on the promi&s;es of great men: I look to the book&s;ellers for &s;upport; they are my be&s;t friends, and I am not inclined to for&s;ake them for others.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus did this idiot in the affairs of the world, trifle with his fortunes, and put back the hand that was held out to a&s;&s;i&s;t him! Other offers of a like kind he either rejected or failed to improve, contenting him&s;elf with the patronage of one nobleman, who&s;e man&s;ion afforded him the delights of a &s;plendid table, and a re|treat for a few days from the metropolis.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="425">
While I was writing the Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic, he, at the club, communicated to me &s;ome curious matter: I de&s;ired he would reduce it to writing; he promi&s;ed me he would, and de&s;ired to &s;ee me at his chambers: I called on him there; he &s;tepped into a clo&s;et, and tore out of a printed book &s;ix leaves that contained what he had mentioned to me.</P>
<P>As he wrote for the book&s;ellers, we, at the club, looked on him as a mere literary drudge, equal to the ta&s;k of compiling and tran&s;lating, but little capable of original, and &s;till le&s;s of poetical compo&s;ition: he had, neverthele&s;s, unknown to us, written and addre&s;&s;ed to the counte&s;s, afterwards duche&s;s, of Northumberland, one of the fine&s;t poems of the lyric kind that our lan|guage has to boa&s;t of, the ballad <Q REND="inline">'Turn gentle Hermit of the dale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in his poetical works. vol. 1.</NOTE>;'</Q> and &s;urpri&s;ed us with <Q REND="inline">'The Tra|veller,'</Q> a poem that contains &s;ome particulars of his own hi&s;tory. John&s;on was &s;uppo&s;ed to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in it; but he contributed to the perfec|tion of it only four lines: his opinion of it was, that it was the be&s;t written poem &s;ince the time of Pope. The favourable reception which this e&s;&s;ay of his poetical talent met with, &s;oon after tempted Gold|&s;mith to the publication of his <Q REND="inline">'De&s;erted Village,'</Q> the merits whereof, con&s;i&s;ting in local particularities and beautiful de&s;criptions of rural manners, are &s;uffi|ciently known.</P>
<P>His poems are replete with fine moral &s;entiments, and be&s;peak a great dignity of mind; yet he had no &s;en&s;e of the &s;hame, nor dread of the evils, of po|verty. In the latter he was at one time &s;o involved,
<PB N="421" REF="426">
that for the clamours of a woman, to whom he was indebted for lodging, and for bailiffs that waited to arre&s;t him, he was equally unable, till he had made him&s;elf drunk, to &s;tay within doors, or go abroad to hawk among the book&s;ellers his<Q REND="inline">'Vicar of Wake-field.'</Q> In this di&s;tre&s;s he &s;ent for John&s;on, who im|mediately went to one of them, and brought back mo|ney for his relief.</P>
<P>In his dealings with the book&s;ellers, he is &s;aid to have acted very di&s;hone&s;tly, never fulfilling his en|gagements. In one year he got of them, and by his plays, the &s;um of 1800l. which he di&s;&s;ipated by gaming and extravagance, and died poor in 1774.</P>
<P>He that can account for the incon&s;i&s;tencies of character above-noted, otherwi&s;e than by &s;hewing, that wit and wi&s;dom are &s;eldom found to meet in the &s;ame mind, will do more than any of Gold|&s;mith's friends were ever able to do. He was bu|ried in the poets' corner in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey. A monument was erected for him by a &s;ub&s;cription of his friends, and is placed over the entrance into St. Bla&s;e's chapel. The in&s;cription thereon was written by John&s;on. This I am able to &s;ay with certainty, for he &s;hewed it to me in manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>The members of our club, that remain to be &s;po|ken of, were per&s;ons of le&s;s celebrity than him above|mentioned, but were better acquainted with the world, and qualified for &s;ocial intercour&s;e. Mr. Beauclerk was allied to the St. Alban's family, and took his chri&s;tian name from Mr Topham of Wind|&s;or, the famous collector of pictures and drawings. To the character of a &s;cholar, and a man of fine parts, he added that of a man of fa&s;hion, of which his
<PB N="422" REF="427">
dre&s;s and equipage &s;hewed him to be emulous. In the early period of his life he was the exemplar of all who wi&s;hed, without incurring the cen&s;ure of foppery, to become con&s;picuous in the gay world. Travel, and a long re&s;idence at Rome and at Ve|nice, had given the la&s;t poli&s;h to his manners, and &s;tored his mind with entertaining information. In painting and &s;culpture, his ta&s;te and judgment were accurate, in cla&s;&s;ic literature, exqui&s;ite; and in the knowledge of hi&s;tory, and the &s;tudy of an|tiquities, he had few equals. His conver&s;ation was of the mo&s;t excellent kind; learned, witty, polite, and, where the &s;ubject required it, &s;erious; and over all his behaviour there beamed &s;uch a &s;un&s;hine of chearfulne&s;s and good humour, as com|municated it&s;elf to all around him. He was a great collector of books, and left at his death a library, which, at a &s;ale by auction, yielded up|wards of five thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. Anthony Chamier was de&s;cended from a French prore&s;tant family, that has produced one or more very eminent divines, and were refugees in this country at the end of the la&s;t century. He was bred to the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;tock-broker; but, having had a liberal education, his deportment and manner of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed him greatly from mo&s;t others of that calling. He had acquired a knowledge of the modern languages, particularly of the Spani&s;h, in the &s;tudy whereof he took great delight. His connections, at his &s;etting out in the world, were of the be&s;t kind, for very early in his life he was employed by tho&s;e liberal-minded bro|thers the Van Necks, who&s;e riches, and general munificence, have ranked them in the &s;ame cla&s;s of
<PB N="423" REF="428">
wealthy men with the Fuggers of Aug&s;burg, a com|pany of money-dealers, who, in their time, held the balance of the Antwerp exchange, and by their tran&s;|actions at that mart, influenced the politics of all the courts of Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A curious account of the&s;e three brothers may be &s;een in Moreri's dictionary, art.

By his dealings in the funds, and, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, with the advantage of intelli|gence which, previous to the conclu&s;ion of the peace before the la&s;t, he had obtained, he acquired &s;uch a fortune as enabled him, though young, to quit bu&s;ine&s;s, and become, what indeed he &s;eemed by nature intended for, a gentleman. At the begin|ning of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty's reign, he had a pro&s;pect of going &s;ecretary to an emba&s;&s;y to Spain, and was preparing for it, by the improvement of him&s;elf in the language of that country, but a change in the appointment of an amba&s;&s;ador kept him at home, and gave him opportunity of becoming acquainted with lord Hil&s;borough, who, upon his being made &s;ecretary of &s;tate the la&s;t time, took him for his under|&s;ecretary, in which &s;tation he died.</P>
<P>It was John&s;on's original intention, that the num|ber of this our club &s;hould not exceed nine, but Mr. Dyer, a member of that in Ivy lane before &s;poken of, and who for &s;ome years had been abroad, made his appearance among us, and was cordially received. By the recommendation of Mr. Belchier the banker, and member for Southwark, he had obtained an ap|pointment to be one of the commi&s;&s;aries in our army in Germany; but, on the conclu&s;ion of the peace, he
<PB N="424" REF="429">
returned to England, very little the better for an em|ployment which few have been known to quit with|out having made a fortune.</P>
<P>The hours which John&s;on &s;pent in this &s;ociety &s;eemed to be the happie&s;t of his life: he would often applaud his own &s;agacity in the &s;election of it, and was &s;o con&s;tant at our meetings as never to ab&s;ent him&s;elf. It is true he came late, but then he &s;tayed late, for, as has been already &s;aid of him, he little regarded hours. Our evening toa&s;t was the motto of Padre Paolo, <Q REND="inline">'E&s;to perpetua.'</Q> A lady, di&s;tingui&s;hed by her beauty, and ta&s;te for literature, invited us twice to a dinner at her hou&s;e, which I alone was hindered from accepting. Curio&s;ity was her motive, and po&s;&s;ibly a de&s;ire of intermingling with our conver&s;ation the charms of her own. She affected to con&s;ider us as a &s;et of literary men, and perhaps gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion for di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;ociety by the name of the literary club, an appellation which it never a&s;&s;umed to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the&s;e our meetings, John&s;on, as indeed he did every where, led the conver&s;ation, yet was he far from arrogating to him&s;elf that &s;uperiority, which, &s;ome years before, he was di&s;po&s;ed to contend for. He had &s;een enough of the world to know, that re&s;pect was not to be extorted, and began now to be &s;atis|fied with that degree of eminence to which his writ|ings had exalted him. This change in his behaviour was remarked by tho&s;e who were be&s;t acquainted with his character, and it rendered him an ea&s;y and delight|ful companion. Our di&s;cour&s;e was mi&s;cellaneous, but chiefly literary. Politics, the mo&s;t vulgar of all topics, were alone excluded. On that &s;ubject mo&s;t of us were of the &s;ame opinion. The Briti&s;h lion
<PB N="425" REF="430">
was then licking his wounds, and we drank to the peace of old England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As I was the only &s;eceder from this &s;ociety, my with|drawing my&s;elf from it &s;eems to require an apology. We &s;eldom got together till nine; the enquiry into the contents of the larder, and preparing &s;upper, took up till ten; and by the time that the table was cleared, it was near cleven, at which hour my &s;ervants were ordered to come for me; and, as I could not enjoy the plea&s;ure of the&s;e meetings without di&s;turbing the oeconomy of my family, I cho&s;e to forego it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The in&s;titution of this &s;ociety was in the winter of 1763, at which time Mr. Garrick was abroad with his wife, who, for the recovery of her health, was &s;ent to the baths at Padua. Upon his return, he was in|formed of our a&s;&s;ociation, and tru&s;ted, that the lea&s;t intimation of a de&s;ire to come among us, would pro|cure him a ready admi&s;&s;ion, but in this he was mi&s;ta|ken. John&s;on con&s;ulted me upon it, and when I could find no objection to receiving him, exclaim|ed:&mdash;'He will di&s;turb us by his buffoonery;'&mdash;and afterwards &s;o managed matters, that he was never formally propo&s;ed, nor, by con&s;equence, ever ad|mitted.</P>
<P>This conduct of John&s;on gave me, for the fir&s;t time, to under&s;tand, that the friend&s;hip between him and Garrick was not &s;o &s;trong as it might be &s;up|po&s;ed to be: it was not like that of David and Jo|nathan; it pa&s;&s;ed not the love of women, and hardly exceeded the &s;trength of an adventitious intimacy: Garrick had a profound veneration for the learning and talents of John&s;on, but was u&s;ed to complain to me, that he was capricious in his friend&s;hip, and, as he termed it, coquetti&s;h in his di&s;play of it. John&s;on, on his part, hated the profe&s;&s;ion of a player, and per|haps
<PB N="426" REF="431">
might contemplate with indignation, that di&s;po|&s;ition of the public, which a&s;&s;igns to tho&s;e who mi|ni&s;ter to their plea&s;ures, greater rewards than to tho&s;e who&s;e employment it is to &s;upply their mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial wants. He might po&s;&s;ibly reflect that, in his out|&s;et in life as an in&s;tructor of youth, his hopes were bounded by the pro&s;pect of five hundred pounds a year, and that the mimetic powers of Garrick, for under that denomination he ranked all his excellencies, produced to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them an income of four thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch excu&s;es for John&s;on's coolne&s;s to|wards an old friend as charity might &s;ugge&s;t; but, alas! it had a deeper root, and it is to be feared that it &s;prung from envy, a pa&s;&s;ion, which he &s;ome|times was candid enough to confe&s;s he was &s;ubject to, and laboured through his life to eradicate. His behaviour to Garrick was ever au&s;tere, like that of a &s;choolma&s;ter to one of his &s;cholars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He a&s;&s;umed a right of correcting his enunciation, and, by an in&s;tance, convinced Garrick that it was &s;ometimes erroneous.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'You often,' &s;aid John&s;on, 'mi&s;take the emphatical word of a &s;entence.'&mdash;'Give me an example,' &s;aid Garrick&mdash;'I cannot,' an&s;wered John&s;on, 'recollect one; but repeat the &s;eventh com|mandment.'&mdash;Garrick pronounced it&mdash;'Thou <HI>&s;halt</HI> not commit adultery.'&mdash;'You are wrong,' &s;aid John&s;on: 'it is a negative precept, and ought to be pronounced thus:

Garrick took his rejection very patiently, and &s;hew|ed his re&s;entment of it no otherwi&s;e, than by enquiring of me from time to time how we went on at the club. He would often &s;top at my gate, in his way to and from Hampton, with me&s;&s;ages from John&s;on relating to his Shake&s;peare, then in the pre&s;s, and a&s;k &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Were you at the club on Monday night?'&mdash;'What did you talk of?'&mdash;'Was John&s;on there?'&mdash;'I &s;uppo&s;e he &s;aid &s;ome|thing of Davy&mdash;that Davy was a clever fellow in his way, full of convivial plea&s;antry, but no poet, no writer, ha?'&mdash;</Q>I was vexed at the&s;e enquiries, and told him, that this perpetual &s;olicitude about what was &s;aid of him, was unnece&s;&s;ary, and could only tend to di&s;turb him; that he might well be content with that &s;hare of the public favour which he enjoyed, that he had nothing to do but to po&s;&s;e&s;s it in quiet|ne&s;s, and that too great an anxiety to obtain applau&s;e would provoke envy, and tend to intercept, if not to|tally deprive him of it.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t of Mr. Garrick's foibles was, a notion of the importance of his profe&s;&s;ion: he thought that Shake&s;peare and him&s;elf were, or ought to be, the objects of all mens' attention. When the king of Denmark was in England, he received an order from the lord-chamberlain to entertain that mo|narch with an exhibition of him&s;elf in &s;ix of his principal characters. In his way to London, to re|ceive his in&s;tructions, he called on me, and told me this as news. I could plainly di&s;cern in his looks the joy that tran&s;ported him; but he affected to be vexed at the &s;hortne&s;s of the notice, and &s;eemed to arraign the wi&s;dom of our councils, by exclaiming&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'You &s;ee what heads they have!'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="433">
John&s;on's objection to the admi&s;&s;ion of Garrick may &s;eem to be cynical, and to have ari&s;en from jealou&s;y or re&s;entment, but it admits of palliation: the truth is, that Garrick was no di&s;qui&s;itor; his reading had been confined, and he could contribute but little to the plea&s;ures of &s;ober and in&s;tructive conver&s;a|tion. Even his knowledge of the world was derived through the medium of the dramatic writers, who, all men know, are not guides to be tru&s;ted; and, in his intercour&s;e with mankind, and manner of con|ducting bu&s;ine&s;s, he frequently betrayed &s;uch igno|rance and inattention, as the following in&s;tance will illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>There &s;tood near the dwelling of Mr. Garrick at Hampton, and adjoining to his garden next the river, a &s;mall hou&s;e, the owner and occupier whereof was Mr. Peele a book&s;eller, who had retired from bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Mr. Peele had often &s;aid, that as he knew it would be an accommodation to Mr. Garrick, he had given directions, that at his decea&s;e he &s;hould have the refu&s;al of it. A man in the neighbourhood had &s;et his eye upon it, and formed a &s;cheme to make it his own. He had got intelligence that there was a relation or friend of Mr. Peele's living in the coun|try, and immediately on Mr. Peele's death applied to his executors, pretending that he had a commi&s;&s;ion from him to purcha&s;e the hou&s;e at any price; and, upon this &s;ugge&s;tion, procured a conveyance of it to a per&s;on nominated by him, but under a &s;ecret tru&s;t for him&s;elf. Mr. Garrick, &s;eeing him&s;elf thus balked of his hopes, and in danger of being troubled with an ill neighbour, thought he had nothing to do but to complain. He told his &s;ad &s;tory to me, and in a
<PB N="429" REF="434">
lucky hour; for, ju&s;t before his entering my hou&s;e, I had been reading the life of the lord-keeper Guild|ford, and therein a ca&s;e of a &s;imilar fraud, again&s;t which his lord&s;hip decreed: it was the ca&s;e of the duke of Buckingham&s;hire and Ambro&s;e Phillips, who had purcha&s;ed of the duke an e&s;tate as for Mr. He|neage Finch, a &s;on of the lord Nottingham, but in truth for him&s;elf, at two thou&s;and pounds le&s;s than he would have &s;old it for to any but Mr. Finch. Upon hearing Mr. Garrick's &s;tory, I &s;earched farther, and found the ca&s;e in law-language in Vernon's chancery reports, and giving him a note of it, told him he might file a bill in chancery, and, on the authority of that deter|mination, hope for relief. About &s;ix months after, I being in town, a me&s;&s;age came to me in the even|ing from Mr. Garrick, &s;ignifying, that his cau&s;e was to come on the next morning, and reque&s;ting me to furni&s;h him with a note of a ca&s;e that I had formerly mentioned to him as re&s;embling his own. A&s;toni&s;hed at his remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and knowing that no time was to be lo&s;t, I immediately borrowed the book I had referred him to, and giving it my &s;ervant, went with it to Drury-lane theatre, where, upon enquiry, I was informed, that he was bu&s;ily employed in exhibiting an imitation of a &s;pectacle then recent, the proce&s;&s;ion of the coronation of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, in an after|piece to the play for that night. I waited in an outer room till all was over, when in entered Mr. and Mrs. Garrick, and, after giving him time to recover from his fatigue, I told him what I had been doing to help him in his di&s;tre&s;s, and produced the book, but his thoughts were &s;o wholly taken up by the pageant he
<PB N="430" REF="435">
was come from, which &s;eemed &s;till to be pa&s;&s;ing before his eyes, that he could &s;earcely attend to me, but a&s;ked Mrs. Garrick twenty que&s;tions about it, how it went off, and whether &s;he did not think the ap|plau&s;e of the audience great. He then turned to me, took from me the book, and &s;aid he &s;hould lay it before his coun&s;el. The book was returned in a few days, but I heard nothing of the decree of the court till &s;ome months after, when meeting with his brother George, in the court of reque&s;ts, I a&s;ked him how the cau&s;e had gone:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Oh,' &s;aid he, 'with us:&mdash;the fir&s;t purcha&s;e is decreed fraudulent, and the defendant is condemned in co&s;ts.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Garrick's forgetfulne&s;s and inattention, in a concern that gave him &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, is not to be accounted for by tho&s;e who believe, contrary to the fact, that he was ever &s;ufficiently awake to his own intere&s;t, nor indeed by any who were not well ac|quainted with his character. In all that related to the theatre he was very acute, but in bu&s;ine&s;s of other kinds a novice. His profe&s;&s;ion was of &s;uch a nature, as left him no intervals of thought or cool deliberation: his mind was either elevated to the highe&s;t pitch of inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">on, or let down to the lowe&s;t degree of remi&s;&s;ion. In the former &s;tate, it was in|flated by the ideas with which the cour&s;e of his read|ing had &s;tored his memory; in the latter, it &s;unk into an indolent levity, which indulged in jokes, in mi|micry, and wittici&s;ms.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;ituations, I have de&s;cribed him by the relation of his conduct in a law-&s;uit: in a &s;ea|&s;on of vacuity, he was another man, ea&s;y and chearful,
<PB N="431" REF="436">
and di&s;po&s;ed, out of every thing he &s;aw or heard, to extract mirth. The following &s;tory I give as an in|&s;tance of his plea&s;antry, at times when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the theatre did not occupy his thoughts.</P>
<P>Living at Twickenham, at about two miles di&s;tance from his hou&s;e at Hampton, I made him, as I fre|quently did when in the country, an afternoon vi&s;it. It was in the month of Augu&s;t, and I found him and Mrs. Garrick in the garden, eating figs. He com|plained that the wa&s;ps, which that year were very nu|merous, had left him very few; and, talking farther about tho&s;e noxious in&s;ects, told me he had heard, that a per&s;on near Uxbridge, having &s;wallowed one of them in a draught of liquor, had died of the &s;ting. I told him it was true, for that at a turnpike-meeting at Uxbridge I had dined with the apothecary that had attended him, and he had a&s;&s;ured me of the fact.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I believe it,'&s;aid Mr. Garrick, 'and have been per&s;uad|ing this lady,'pointing to Mrs. Garrick, 'to do &s;o; but I cannot convince her, and yet, &s;he can believe the &s;tory of St. Ur&s;ula and the eleven thou&s;and vir|gins!'&mdash;</Q>Mrs. Garrick, it is no &s;ecret, is of the Ro|mi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Davies, in his life of Mr. Garrick, has mentioned a variety of particulars that do honour to his memory. Among others, he gives &s;everal in&s;tances of liberality to his friends. John&s;on would frequently &s;ay, that he gave away more money than any man of his income in England; and his readine&s;s to give the profits of a night to public charities, and to families and indi|viduals in di&s;tre&s;s, will long be remembered. He was the fir&s;t that attempted to reform the &s;tage, by bani&s;h|ing from it all profanene&s;s and immorality, and by ex|punging
<PB N="432" REF="437">
from the plays acted at his theatre, every expre&s;&s;ion capable of any other than a good meaning. And whereas it had for many years been the cu&s;tom, at one or more of the theatres, to indulge the mob, in the evening of the lord-mayor's day, with the repre&s;entation of <Q REND="inline">'The London Cuckolds,'</Q> a comedy written by Raven&s;croft in times of great licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and abounding in &s;cenes of vulgar humour, he paid a hand&s;ome compliment to the ci|tizens, and &s;hewed his regard for the welfare of youth, by di&s;continuing the practice, and &s;ub&s;tituting in its place the affecting tragedy of <Q REND="inline">'George Barnwell,'</Q> a play adapted to the &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of city apprentices, and affording an in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on of di&s;cretion and morality.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the perpetual competition be|tween him and Rich, for the favour of the town, they lived together upon the mo&s;t friendly terms. Rich, who was never celebrated either for his wit or his under&s;tanding, once made him a very elegant compliment: the occa&s;ion was this: Rich had im|proved his hou&s;e at Covent garden, by altering the di&s;|po&s;ition of the &s;eats, &s;o as to accommodate a greater number of &s;pectators than formerly it would, and Mr. Garrick wi&s;hing to &s;ee the&s;e improvements, Mr. Rich invited him to the hou&s;e, and went with him all over it. In the cour&s;e of their &s;urvey, Mr. Gar|rick a&s;ked, in the language of the theatre, what &s;um of money the hou&s;e would hold.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid Mr. Rich, 'that que&s;tion que&s;tion I am at pre&s;ent unable to an&s;wer; but were Mr. Garrick to appear but one night on my &s;tage, I &s;hould be able to tell to the utmo&s;t &s;hil|ling.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="438">
After all that has been &s;aid of Mr. Garrick, envy mu&s;t own, that he owed his celebrity to his merit; and yet, of that him&s;elf &s;eemed &s;o diffident, that he practi&s;ed &s;undry little, but innocent arts, to in&s;ure the favour of the public. He kept up an intere&s;t in the city by appearing, about twice in a winter, at Tom's coffee-hou&s;e in Cornhill, the u&s;ual rendezvous of young merchants at 'change time; and frequented a club, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ake of his company, at the Queen's-arms tavern in St. Paul's church-yard, where were u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble Mr. Sa|muel Sharpe the &s;urgeon, Mr. Pater&s;on the city-&s;oli|citor, Mr. Draper the book&s;eller, Mr. Clutterbuck a mercer, and a few others; they were none of them drinkers, and in order to make a reckoning, called only for French wine. The&s;e were his &s;tanding council in theatrical affairs, and were of u&s;e to him in moderating his re&s;entment after tho&s;e riots at his theatre, which would &s;ometimes happen, and the in|dignation he once felt upon an attack on his dwelling-hou&s;e, in which the windows thereof were broken.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o a &s;trong party of friends at Bat&s;on's coffee-hou&s;e, and among them Dr. Wil&s;on a phy&s;i|cian, a man of great learning<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was the editor of the works of Benjamin Robins, pub|li&s;hed in two volumes 8vo.</NOTE>, but no practice, who having an ea&s;y fortune and no family, and being ma&s;|ter of his own time, was at liberty to indulge him|&s;elf in a variety of pur&s;uits and humours that di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him from mo&s;t other men. He lodged in an ob&s;cure part of the town, and &s;pent his mornings in mathematical &s;tudies; but at noon was con&s;tantly to
<PB N="434" REF="439">
be &s;een at Bat&s;on's, with a circle of per&s;ons round him, whom he entertained with his conver&s;ation. He had no ta&s;te for polite literature or &s;tage entertainments; but in his old age took it into his head to be an ad|mirer of Mr. Garrick, and &s;eldom failed to be at his theatre, whenever he had a part in the play of the night. His con&s;tant appearance there had procured him almo&s;t a pre&s;criptive right to a particular &s;eat in the pit. In that region of the hou&s;e he was the fir&s;t, and almo&s;t the loude&s;t applauder of Mr. Garrick, and his prai&s;es were the chief &s;ubject of his di&s;cour&s;e the &s;ucceeding day. To this per&s;on, as to a city-friend, Mr. Garrick held him&s;elf obliged, and by many per|&s;onal civilities he courted his favour.</P>
<P>Such as tho&s;e above noted were the foibles in the character of that celebrated actor of whom I have been &s;peaking, and &s;uch were the arts which he prac|ti&s;ed to acquire and en&s;ure popularity; arts as unne|ce&s;&s;ary as they were innocent, &s;eeing, that almo&s;t from the time he fir&s;t became known, he was in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that applau&s;e which he was &s;eeking, and received from the public an ample reward of repu|tation, as well for the part he acted in &s;ocial life, as for his excellent performance on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Mr. Garrick, there were others that were de&s;irous of becoming members of this our club, the fame whereof had &s;pread abroad, and induced many, who hoped to acquire a reputation for literature, to wi&s;h for an admi&s;&s;ion among us. That unfor|tunate divine, as he was called, Dr. William Dodd, was one of the number, and made a &s;ecret effort for this purpo&s;e. This per&s;on, at that time, dwelt with his wife in an ob&s;cure corner of Houn&s;low heath,
<PB N="435" REF="440">
near a village called Worton; but kept, in a back lane near him, a girl who went by the name of Ken|nedy. His preten&s;ions to learning, and e&s;pecially to cla&s;&s;ical erudition, were very great; and he had in his hou&s;e a few young gentlemen, who, at very expen|&s;ive rates, were committed to his care, as to an aca|demy, for in&s;truction. A brother of his wife's rented &s;ome land of me, and of him I learned from time to time many particulars re&s;pecting his character and man|ner of living, which latter, as he repre&s;ented it, was ever &s;uch as his vi&s;ible income would no way ac|count for. He &s;aid that he was the mo&s;t importunate &s;uitor for preferment ever known, and that him&s;elf had been the bearer of letters and me&s;&s;ages to great men, &s;oliciting promotion to vacant livings, and had hardly e&s;caped kicking down &s;tairs. Dodd's wi&s;h to be received into our &s;ociety was conveyed to us only by a whi&s;per, and that being the ca&s;e, all op|po&s;ition to his admi&s;&s;ion became unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>John&s;on was now at ea&s;e in his circum&s;tances: he wanted his u&s;ual motive to impel him to the ex|ertion of his talents, nece&s;&s;ity, and he &s;unk into indo|lence. Whoever called in on him at about mid|day, found him and Levett at breakfa&s;t, John&s;on in de&s;habille, as ju&s;t ri&s;en from bed, and Levett filling out tea for him&s;elf and his patron alternately, no conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ing between them. All that vi&s;ited him at the&s;e hours, were welcome. A night's re&s;t, and breakfa&s;t, &s;eldom failed to refre&s;h and fit him for di&s;cour&s;e, and whoever withdrew went too &s;oon. His invitations to dinners abroad were numerous, and he &s;eldom balked them. At evening parties, where were
<PB N="436" REF="441">
no cards, he very often made one; and from the&s;e, when once engaged, mo&s;t unwillingly retired.</P>
<P>In the relaxation of mind, which almo&s;t any one might have fore&s;een would follow the grant of his pen&s;ion, he made little account of that lap&s;e of time, on which, in many of his papers, he &s;o &s;everely mora|lizes. And, though he was &s;o exact an ob&s;erver of the pa&s;&s;ing minutes, as frequently, after his coming from church, to note in his diary how many the &s;er|vice took up in reading, and the &s;ermon in preaching; he &s;eemed to forget how many years had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince he had begun to take in &s;ub&s;criptions for his edition of Shake&s;peare. Such a torpor had &s;eized his facul|ties, as not all the remon&s;trances of his friends were able to cure: applied to &s;ome minds, they would have burned like cau&s;tics, but John&s;on felt them not: to other objects he was &s;ufficiently attentive, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew.</P>
<P>In the performance of the engagement I am under, I find my&s;elf compelled to make public, as well tho&s;e particulars of John&s;on that may be thought to aba&s;e as tho&s;e that exalt his character. Among the former, may be reckoned the credit he for &s;ome time gave to the idle &s;tory of the Cock-lane gho&s;t, concerning which the following facts are the lea&s;t unworthy of being noted. In the month of January 1762, it was reported, that at a hou&s;e in Cock lane near We&s;t Smithfield, there were heard certain noi&s;es, accom|panied with extraordinary circum&s;tances, tending to the di&s;covery of the death of a young woman who was &s;aid to have been de&s;troyed by poi&s;on. The agent in this bu&s;ine&s;s was a girl, who pretended, that
<PB N="437" REF="442">
the &s;pirit of the decea&s;ed appeared to her, and ter|rified her with the noi&s;es above-mentioned. This report drew many per&s;ons to the hou&s;e, who, being thus a&s;&s;embled, put &s;everal que&s;tions to the girl, and received an&s;wers, as from the gho&s;t, de&s;cribing the circum&s;tances of the poi&s;oning, and a promi&s;e, by an affirmative &s;ignal, that it would attend one of the queri&s;ts into the vault under the church of St. John, Clerkenwell, where the body was depo&s;ited, and give a token of its pre&s;ence by a knock upon the coffin: it was therefore determined to make trial of the ex|i&s;tence or veracity of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pirit; and it was then adverti&s;ed, that the per&s;on to whom the promi&s;e was made, was about to vi&s;it the vault, and ac|cordingly the whole company pre&s;ent adjourned to the church. He who had a claim to the performance of the promi&s;e, and one more, went into the vault, and &s;olemnly required to hear the &s;ignal; but nothing more en&s;ued. The per&s;on accu&s;ed of the poi&s;oning, with &s;everal others, then de&s;cended the vault, but no effect was perceived. It was, therefore, the opinion of the whole a&s;&s;embly, that the girl had &s;ome art of making or counterfeiting particular noi&s;es, and that there was no agency of any higher cau&s;e.</P>
<P>John&s;on, who&s;e &s;entiments with re&s;pect to &s;uperna|tural agency are di&s;coverable in many parts of his writings, was prompted by curio&s;ity to vi&s;it this place, and wait for the appearance of the gho&s;t. Mr. Saun|ders Welch, his intimate friend, would have di&s;&s;uaded him from his purpo&s;e, urging, that it would expo&s;e him to ridicule; but all his arguments had no effect; he went to the hou&s;e, and, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, into the
<PB N="438" REF="443">
church, and gave countenance to the vulgar expec|tation, that the gho&s;t would appear; but at length, being convinced that the whole tran&s;action was an impo&s;ture, he drew up, as may be inferred from the &s;tyle and adverti&s;ement at the end of the paper, an account of the detection thereof, publi&s;hed in the Gentleman's Magazine for February 1762.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the impo&s;ture being more clearly and even to demon&s;tration detected, the per&s;ons con|cerned in it were pro&s;ecuted, and underwent a puni&s;h|ment &s;uited to their offence.</P>
<P>What Mr. Welch foretold, in his advice to John&s;on, touching this impo&s;ture, was now verified: he was cen&s;ured for his credulity; his wi&s;dom was arraigned, and his religious opinions re&s;olved into &s;uper&s;tition. A reverend divine of the time, who had taken effec|tual care by his conduct to avoid the like imputa|tions, but was enough di&s;tingui&s;hed by a greater folly, political enthu&s;ia&s;m, exhibited him to ridicule in a &s;atyrical poem, and revived the remembrance of that engagement to the public, which, by this, and other in&s;tances of the laxity of his mind, he &s;eemed not much inclined to fulfil.</P>
<P>Nor was this all: that facetious gentleman Mr. Foote, who, upon the &s;trength and &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;a|tyrical vein in comedy, had a&s;&s;umed the name of the modern Ari&s;tophanes, and at his theatre, had long en|tertained the town with caricatures of living per&s;ons, with all their &s;ingularities and weakne&s;&s;es, thought that John&s;on at this time was become a fit &s;ubject for ridicule, and that an exhibition of him in a drama written for the purpo&s;e, in which him&s;elf &s;hould re|pre&s;ent John&s;on, and in his mien, his garb, and his
<PB N="439" REF="444">
&s;peech, &s;hould di&s;play all his comic powers, would yield him a golden harve&s;t. John&s;on was appri&s;ed of his intention; and gave Mr. Foote to under&s;tand, that the licence under which he was permitted to entertain the town, would not ju&s;tify the liberties he was accu&s;tomed to take with private characters, and that if he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, him&s;elf would be a &s;pectator of his di&s;grace, and would, by a &s;evere cha&s;|ti&s;ement of his repre&s;entative on the &s;tage, and in the face of the whole audience, convince the world, that, whatever were his infirmities, or even his foibles, they &s;hould not be made the &s;port of the public, or the means of gain to any one of his profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Had John&s;on been provoked to an exerci&s;e of his prowe&s;s on this occa&s;ion, it would not have been the fir&s;t di&s;play of his re|&s;entment on the &s;tage of a theatre. He was once with Garrick at the repre&s;entation of a play in his native city of Lichfield, when, having taken his &s;eat in a chair placed on the &s;tage, he had &s;oon a call to quit it. A Scots officer, who had no good-will towards him, per&s;uaded an innkeeper of the town to take it, and he did as he was bid. John&s;on, on his return, finding his &s;eat &s;ull, civilly told the intruder, that by going out it was not his inten|tion to give it up, and demanded it as his right: the innkeeper, encouraged by the officer, &s;eeming re&s;olved to maintain his &s;itua|tion, John&s;on expo&s;tulated the matter with him; but finding him ob&s;tinate, lifted up the chair, the man &s;itting in it, and, with &s;uch an Herculean force, flung both to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;tage, that the Scot&s;man cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Damn him, he has broke his limbs;'</Q> but that not being the ca&s;e, John&s;on having thus emptied the chair, and Mr. Walm&s;ley interpo&s;ing, he re&s;umed his &s;eat in it, and with great compo&s;ure &s;at out the play.</P>
<P>John&s;on had great confidence in his corporeal &s;trength, and, from this and &s;ome other particulars in his life, I am inclined to think he was vain of it. Such foibles are not uncommon in the greate&s;t characters. Sir I&s;aac Newton, at the age of four|&s;core, would &s;trip up his &s;hirt-&s;leeve to &s;hew his mu&s;cular, brawny arm, and relate how dextrous he was in his youth at boxing. And an intimate friend of mine, a &s;erjeant at law, of the fir&s;t eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, who had nearly lo&s;t the u&s;e of his feet, was u&s;ed to relate to me his dancing whole nights, when a young man, without feeling the lea&s;t wearine&s;s.</P></NOTE>.

Foote, upon this intimation, had di&s;cretion enough to de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e. John&s;on entertained no re&s;entment again&s;t him, and they were ever after friends.</P>
<P>John&s;on was in&s;en&s;ible to the effects of this abu&s;e; but the poem above-mentioned had brought to re|membrance, that his edition of Shake&s;peare had long been due. His friends took the alarm, and, by all the arts of rea&s;oning and per&s;ua&s;ion, laboured to convince him, that having taken &s;ub&s;criptions for a work in which he had made no progre&s;s, his credit was at &s;take. He confe&s;&s;ed he was culpable, and promi&s;ed from time to time to begin a cour&s;e of &s;uch reading as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to qualify him for the work: this was no more than he had formerly done in an engagement with Coxeter, to whom he had bound him&s;elf to write the life of Shake&s;peare, but he never could be prevailed on to begin it, &s;o that, even now, it was que&s;tioned whether his promi&s;es were to be relied on. For this rea&s;on, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, and &s;ome other of his friends, who were more concerned for his reputation than him&s;elf &s;eemed to be, contrived to entangle him by a wager, or &s;ome other pecuniary engagement, to perform his ta&s;k by a certain time, and this, toge|ther po&s;&s;ibly with &s;ome di&s;tru&s;t of the continuance of his mental powers, &s;et him to work; but, as he had been remi&s;s in making collections for the purpo&s;e, he

found it an irk&s;ome ta&s;k. Theobald declares, that to &s;ettle the text of his author, and to elucidate ob|&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages in him, he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to peru&s;e a great number of plays and other publications, to the very titles of mo&s;t whereof it is certain John&s;on was a &s;tranger. He, it is true, had red as many old Eng|li&s;h books as came in his way, but he had never &s;ought after any &s;uch; he was no collector, and in fact was de&s;titute of materials for his work. All therefore that he did, or could do, after the wa&s;te of &s;o much time, was, to read over his author in the former edi|tions, and &s;olicit help from his friends; who, if he is not mi&s;taken in his a&s;&s;ertion, were but &s;lack in offer|ing him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To me, among others, he did the honour of &s;ending for &s;uch notes as he thought I might have made in the cour&s;e of my reading. Mr. Garrick was his me&s;&s;enger, as he frequently pa&s;&s;ed by my gate in the country; and, though I was at that time deeply engaged in the Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ic, I fur|ni&s;hed him with a few remarks, which, unimportant as they are, he thought fit to in&s;ert. Others, more valuable, he got from &s;uch of his friends as were at lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>The year 1765 gave to the world an edition of Shake&s;peare's dramatic works by Samuel John&s;on, the greate&s;t proficient in vernacular erudition, and one of the able&s;t critics of his time. Much had been expected from it, and little now appeared to have been performed; a few conjectural emenda|tions of the text, and &s;ome &s;cattered remarks on particular pa&s;&s;ages, were all that was pre&s;ented to our view that had any pretence to novelty, except
<PB N="442" REF="447">
&s;ome general ob&s;ervations, which &s;erve to illu&s;trate the beauties and mark the defects of the &s;everal plays, and are in&s;erted at the end of each.</P>
<P>For the apparent meagrene&s;s of the work, the pau|city of the notes, and other evidences of the editor's want of indu&s;try, and indeed unfitne&s;s for the office of a &s;cholia&s;t, &s;o far as it regards the illu&s;tration of the text, &s;ome atonement, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is made by the preface, wherein, as if the author had re&s;erved him&s;elf for one great effort of his genius, all the powers of eloquence and critical erudition are di&s;played. In truth, it is an e&s;&s;ay on dramatic poe&s;y in general, in which, with a degree of per&s;picacity that had never before been exerci&s;ed on the &s;ubject, he has exhibited the perfections of his author in a blaze of &s;plendour that di&s;tracts us with its radiance. To attemper our admiration, he has, however, thought fit to note the &s;lumbers of even this great genius, his violations of hi&s;torical truth, his deviations from dramatic regularity, his low conceits, and the frequent recurrence of &s;cenes that &s;u&s;pend actions of importance, and, wherever interpo&s;ed, are ex|cre&s;cences; and this not in a &s;tyle of perfunctory di&s;qui&s;ition, but with &s;uch a degree of a&s;perity as critics di&s;cover when they are critici&s;ing the works of a rival.</P>
<P>For thus detracting from the merit of his favou|rite, Mr. Garrick was to the highe&s;t degree exa&s;pe|rated with John&s;on: he reproached him, though not to his face, with want of feeling and the knowledge of human nature, of which, he &s;aid, he under&s;tood nothing, but what he had learned from books:&mdash;<PB N="443" REF="448"><Q REND="inline">'All that he writes,' added he, 'comes from his head: Shake&s;peare, when he &s;at down to write, dipped his pen into his own heart<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The recollection of this forcible and ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, which Mr. Garrick uttered to me, induces me to relate a tran&s;action, that may &s;erve to prove, how deeply Shake&s;peare was &s;killed in the &s;cience of human nature, and that his imagination could &s;ug|ge&s;t &s;entiments and language &s;uitable to characters and &s;ituations, with which he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed ever to have been conver|&s;ant. No one thinks that he had ever been a witne&s;s to &s;uch a &s;cene as that in Macbeth, where the lady, who had excited her hu&s;band to the murder of the king, is her&s;elf re&s;trained from the perpetration of it by the &s;ole reflection, that in his &s;leep he re&s;embled her &s;ather: yet &s;ee how wonderfully his repre&s;entation of it accords with the workings of nature.</P>
<P>A few years &s;ince, and while I was chairman of the quarter|fe&s;&s;ions for the county of Middle&s;ex, an indictment came before me for trial at Hicks's-hall, the ground whereof was the follow|ing ca&s;e. A ve&s;&s;el, moored by a haw&s;er or cable-rope, was lying in the Thames near Wapping, at a time when a barge was driving up the river with &s;o &s;trong a tide, that the men on board her were in great danger of running, as they call it, athwart the haw&s;er and of over&s;etting. To prevent this mi&s;chief, a young active man, who guided the barge, leaped into the ve&s;&s;el, a liberty in &s;uch ca&s;es always allowed, and loo&s;ening the end of the haw&s;er from what it was tied to, let it drop. The men on board the ve&s;&s;el, ignorant perhaps of the u&s;age, oppo&s;ed the young man in his attempt, and a fray en&s;ued, in which, provoked to re&s;i&s;t|ance, he &s;eized a hand-&s;pike, and with it knocked one of the &s;ailors down. The noi&s;e of this &s;cuffle drew up the ma&s;ter, a per|&s;on advanced in years, who all the while was under deck, and he being told what had pa&s;&s;ed, a&s;ked the &s;tranger what he meant by knocking his man down.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I did it,' an&s;wered he, 'in my own defence; and if you had been in his place, and your old grey locks had not put me in mind of my own father, I would have knocked you down too.'&mdash;</Q>The very &s;entiment that re&s;trained lady Macbeth from the murder of Duncan:<Q><L>&mdash;Had he not re&s;embled</L>

John&s;on &s;eemed to be con&s;cious that this work would fall &s;hort of the expectations it had rai&s;ed, and endeavoured to ward off the cen&s;ure of the public by an in&s;inuation in the preface, that his friends had been backward in furni&s;hing him with a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The pa&s;&s;age is pretty &s;trongly pointed, and is here given in his own words.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Having cla&s;&s;ed the ob&s;ervations of others, I was at la&s;t to try what I could &s;ub&s;titute for their mi&s;|takes, and how I could &s;upply their omi&s;&s;ions. I collated &s;uch copies as I could procure, and wi&s;hed for more, but have not found the collectors of the&s;e rarities very communicative.

<P>Few there were who &s;aw this pa&s;&s;age, and knew that Mr. Garrick had the earlie&s;t editions of all Shake&s;peare's plays, but con&s;trued this into a re|proach on him; in that &s;en&s;e he under&s;tood it, and it gave him great offence. To clear him&s;elf of the imputation of a conduct &s;o unfriendly, he pro|te&s;ted to me, that his collection had ever been ac|ce&s;&s;ible to John&s;on, and that him&s;elf had &s;ignified, that any or all the books in it were at his &s;ervice; and, farther to convince me, he, at the next vi&s;it I made him, called in his man Charles, and bade him relate to me his in&s;tructions re&s;pecting the u&s;e of his library, or the loan of books to John&s;on.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid the man, 'I was told to let Mr. John&s;on have what|ever books he wanted; but he never applied for any<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Garrick knew not what ri&s;que he ran by this offer.

Among the books in his library, at the time of his decea&s;e, I found a very old and curious edition of the works of Politian, which appeared to belong to Pembroke college, Oxford. It was probably taken out of the library when he was preparing to publi&s;h a part of that author, viz. in 1734, and had been u&s;ed as his own for upwards of fifty years.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="450">
To &s;ay the truth, Mr. Garrick was rather forward in offering the u&s;e of his library to the writers of the time: he did it to Mr. Whalley, when editing the works of Ben Jon&s;on, and to Dr. Percy, the collector and publi&s;her of the <Q REND="inline">'Reliques of ancient Engli&s;h poetry.'</Q> His view, as I conjecture, was, to receive, in return for his kindne&s;s, thanks, with perhaps &s;ome additional compliment; and in the&s;e two in&s;tances he was gratified with both. I imagine that John&s;on was unwilling to buy the favour intended him at that price, and that therefore he declined it.</P>
<P>We are not to &s;uppo&s;e that the publication of Shake&s;peare, a work undertaken without any im|pul&s;e, and executed with reluctance, would greatly add to the literary reputation of John&s;on; yet &s;uch was the character he had acquired by his dictionary, and other of his writings, that the heads of the uni|ver&s;ity of Dublin thought him worthy of the highe&s;t academical honour that it was in their power to con|fer, and accordingly, on the twenty-third day of July 1765, he was, by them, pre&s;ented with a diploma, creating him doctor in both laws; a di&s;tinction the more to be valued as it was un&s;olicited, and a volun|tary te&s;timony of the e&s;teem in which he was held by that learned body.

<P>His great affection for our own univer&s;ities, and par|ticularly his attachment to Oxford, prevented John&s;on from receiving this honour as it was intended, and he never a&s;&s;umed the title which it conferred. He was as little plea&s;ed to be called Doctor in con&s;equence of it, as he was with the title of Domine, which a friend of his once incautiou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed him by. He thought it alluded to his having been a &s;chool|ma&s;ter; and, though he has ably vindicated Milton from the reproach that Salma&s;ius meant to fix on him, by &s;aying that he was of that profe&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his life of Milton among the lives of the poets.</NOTE>, he wi&s;hed to have it forgot, that him&s;elf had ever been driven to it as the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and had failed in the attempt.</P>
<P>John&s;on was now arrived at the fifty-&s;ixth year of his age, and had actually attained to that &s;tate of independence, which before he could only affect. He was now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an income that freed him from the apprehen&s;ions of want, and exempted him from the nece&s;&s;ity of mental labour. He had di&s;charged his obligations to the public, and, with no incumbrance of a family, or any thing to controul his wi&s;hes or de&s;ires, he had his mode of living to chu&s;e. Ble&s;t with what was to him a competence, he had it now in his power to &s;tudy, to meditate, and to put in practice a variety of good re&s;olutions, which, almo&s;t from his fir&s;t entrance into life, he had been making.

It was a frequent practice with him, in his addre&s;&s;es to the divine Maje&s;ty, to commemorate and recom|mend to mercy his wife and departed friends; and the knowledge thereof has induced a &s;u&s;picion, that he adopted the Romi&s;h tenet of Purgatory. To clear his memory from this imputation, I am ne|ce&s;&s;itated to mention a few particulars which I learned from him in conver&s;ation, that may &s;erve to &s;hew, that no &s;uch conclu&s;ion is to be drawn from his practice in this re&s;pect; for that his ac|quie&s;cence therein aro&s;e from a controver&s;y, which, about the year 1715, was agitated between certain divines of a Prote&s;tant communion, that profe&s;&s;ed to deny, not le&s;s than they did the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, that of purgatory.</P>
<P>The&s;e were, the non-juring clergy of the time; of whom, and al&s;o of their writings, John&s;on was ever u&s;ed to &s;peak with great re&s;pect. One of them, Dr. Thomas Brett, was a man profoundly &s;killed in ritual literature, as appears by a di&s;&s;ertation of his, printed, together with a collection of ancient liturgies, in 1720<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John&s;on once told me, he had heard his father &s;ay, that when he was young in trade, king Edward the &s;ixth's fir&s;t liturgy was much enquired for, and &s;etched a great price; but that the publi|cation of this book, which contained the whole communion office as it &s;tands in the former, reduced the price of it to that of a com|mon book.</NOTE>; and he, as I infer from the &s;tyle of the book and the method of rea&s;oning therein, wrote a tract intitled, <Q REND="inline">'Rea&s;ons for re&s;toring &s;ome prayers and directions, as they &s;tand in the communion-&s;ervice of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h reformed liturgy, compiled by the bi&s;hops in the &s;econd and third years of king Edward VI.'</Q> among which he argues for the following pe|tition,

<P>He fir&s;t &s;hews, that the recommending the dead to the mercy of God is nothing of the remains of popery, but a con&s;tant u&s;age of the primitive church, and for this a&s;&s;ertion, he produces the authority of Tertullian, who flouri&s;hed within an hundred years after the death of the apo&s;tle St. John, and al&s;o, the authority of St. Cyprian, St. Cyril, St. Ambro&s;e, St. Epiphanius, St. Chry&s;o&s;tom, and St. Augu&s;tine, by citations from the &s;everal writings of tho&s;e fathers.</P>
<P>He then argues, that this cu&s;tom neither &s;uppo&s;es the modern purgatory, nor gives encouragement to libertini&s;m and vice; that the ancient church be|lieved the recommending the dead a &s;erviceable office; that the cu&s;tom &s;eems to have gone upon this principle, that &s;upreme happine&s;s is not to be expected till the re&s;urrection, and that the interval
<PB N="450" REF="455">
between death and the end of the world is a &s;tate of imperfect bli&s;s; the church therefore, concludes he, might believe her prayers for good people would improve their condition, and rai&s;e the &s;atisfactions of this period.</P>
<P>No one will &s;ay that the&s;e are mean authorities, or object to the practice of thus recommending the dead, as an innovation, excepting tho&s;e per&s;ons who reject all tradition in matters of religion. Bucer was one that did, and, therefore, being con&s;ulted in the revi&s;al of king Edward's fir&s;t liturgy, he argued, that there being no expre&s;s warrant in Scripture for the practice, prayer for the dead was &s;inful; and, accordingly, the words contended for were omitted in the &s;econd.</P>
<P>This tract was, with great acutene&s;s, and no le&s;s learning, an&s;wered by another nonjuring divine, in one intitled <Q REND="inline">'No &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for re&s;toring &s;ome prayers and directions of king Edward the &s;ixth's liturgy.'</Q> A reply was given to it, and the contro|ver&s;y was carried on to a great length; the re&s;ult of it was, a &s;chi&s;m among the nonjurors: tho&s;e, for re&s;toring the prayers, compiled a new communion-office; others, who were again&s;t widening the breach with the nati|onal church, cho&s;e to abide by the pre&s;ent form; and this diver&s;ity of &s;entiments and practice was, as John|&s;on once told me, the ruin of the nonjuring cau&s;e.</P>

Here, he was in a &s;ituation and circum&s;tances that en|abled him to enjoy the vi&s;its of his friends, and to receive them in a manner &s;uitable to the rank and condition of many of them. A &s;ilver &s;tandi&s;h, and &s;ome u&s;eful plate, which he had been prevailed on to accept as pledges of kindne&s;s from &s;ome who mo&s;t e&s;teemed him, together with furniture that would not have di&s;graced a better dwelling, bani&s;hed tho&s;e ap|pearances of &s;qualid indigence, which, in his le&s;s happy days, di&s;gu&s;ted tho&s;e who came to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>In one of his diaries he noted down a re&s;olution to take a &s;eat in the church: this he might po&s;&s;ibly do about the time of this his removal. The church he frequented was that of St. Clement Danes, which, though not his pari&s;h-church, he preferred to that of the Temple, which I recommended to him, as being free from noi&s;e, and, in other re&s;pects, more commo|dious. His only rea&s;on was, that in the former he was be&s;t known. He was not con&s;tant in his at|tendance on divine wor&s;hip; but, from an opinion peculiar to him&s;elf, and which he once intimated to me, &s;eemed to wait for &s;ome &s;ecret impul&s;e as a mo|tive to it.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="458">
I could never collect from his di&s;cour&s;e, that he was drawn to public wor&s;hip by the charms of pul|pit eloquence, or any affection for popular preachers, who, in general, are the wor&s;t; nor can I form any judgment of the value he &s;et on it, having never been pre&s;ent with him at church but once, and that at a time, when, in compliment to him, as it may be &s;up|po&s;ed, the preacher gave us a &s;ermon, that red like a Saturday's Rambler<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ramblers publi&s;hed on Saturdays were generally on reli|gious or moral &s;ubjects.</NOTE>, and was, by many, &s;oon di&s;|covered to have been ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould, or, in other words, of John&s;on's compo&s;ing; but he &s;eemed to think it a duty to accept in good part the endea|vours of all public in&s;tructors, however meanly qua|lified for the office, and ever to forbear exerci&s;ing his critical talents on the effu&s;ions of men inferior in learning and abilities to him&s;elf. Probably he, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, recollected the quaint di&s;tich of Her|bert:<Q><L>The wor&s;t have &s;omething good; where all want &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>God takes the text and preacheth patience.</L></Q></P>
<P>Or he might have red, among the e&s;&s;ays of the Me&s;&s;ieurs of Port-Royal, one that teaches us how to profit by bad preaching.</P>
<P>The Sundays which he pa&s;&s;ed at home were, ne|verthele&s;s, &s;pent in private exerci&s;es of devotion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was accu&s;tomed on the&s;e days to read the Scriptures, and particularly the Greek Te&s;tament, with the paraphra&s;e of Era&s;mus.

and &s;anctified by acts of charity of a &s;ingular kind: on that day he accepted of no invitation abroad, but gave a dinner to &s;uch of his poor friends as might el&s;e have gone without one.</P>
<P>He had little now to conflict with but what he called his morbid melancholy, which, though oppre&s;|&s;ive, had its intermi&s;&s;ions, and left him the free ex|erci&s;e of all his faculties, and the power of enjoying the conver&s;ation of his numerous friends and vi&s;itants. The&s;e reliefs he owed in a great mea&s;ure to the u&s;e of opium, which, as I have el&s;ewhere mentioned, he was accu&s;tomed to take in large quantities, the effect whereof was generally &s;uch an exhilaration of his &s;pirits as he &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected for intoxication.</P>
<P>I am now about to mention a remarkable era of his life, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a connexion that, for many years, was a &s;ource of great &s;atisfaction and comfort to him. It was a friend&s;hip, contracted, as his diary imports, in 1765, with Mr. Thrale, a brewer, in Southwark, who, though a follower of a trade, which in other countries is lightly thought of, yet as in this it implies great opulence, and the power of conducing in various ways to the intere&s;ts of the community, ranked as a gentleman. He had received the be|nefit of an univer&s;ity education, and was a repre&s;en|tative in parliament, as his father had been, for the above-mentioned borough; and in every view of his character, could not but be deemed a valuable addi|tion
<PB N="455" REF="460">
to the number of John&s;on's friends. To his villa at Streatham, in Surrey, John&s;on was invited, not as a gue&s;t, but as a re&s;iant, whenever he was di&s;po&s;ed to change the town for the coun|try air: for his accommodation, an apartment was allotted; for his entertainment, a library was fur|ni&s;hed with &s;uch books as him&s;elf cho&s;e, and little was wanting to per&s;uade him, that, when at Streatham, he was at home. He &s;oon experienced the &s;alutary ef|fects of his new abode, and there is little doubt that to it he was indebted for &s;ome years of his life.</P>
<P>It might have been expected that John&s;on, in the ea&s;y circum&s;tances in which he had for &s;ome time felt him&s;elf, and with &s;uch a love of independence as he affected, would have declined obligations that he was unable to repay, at lea&s;t in kind; but he knew that friend&s;hip weighs not in a balance the fa|vours it confers. Mr. Thrale's tenders carried in them all the evidences of &s;incerity, and he had the example of men, equally wi&s;e with him&s;elf, to ju&s;tify his acceptance of &s;uch invitations as were now made him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The in&s;tances of this kind, that occur in the lives of eminent men, to &s;peak of tho&s;e of this country only, are not few. Hobbes of Malme&s;bury, pa&s;&s;ed many years of his life in philo&s;ophical re|tirement at Chat&s;worth, in the family of the earl of Devon&s;hire; memorials whereof were formerly vi&s;ible in Latin ver&s;es, written by him, with a diamond, on the windows of the hou&s;e. Selden, at the counte&s;s of Kent's in White-friars, adjoining to the Temple. Mr. Locke was con&s;idered as one of the family of lady Ma&s;ham, at Oates in the county of E&s;&s;ex. She was a daughter of Dr. Ralph Cudworth, a woman of &s;uch eminence for learning and piety, that the book intitled, <Q REND="inline">'The whole duty of man'</Q> was, for &s;ome time, believed to be of her writing; and la&s;tly, Dr. I&s;aac Watts found a comfortable retreat from the cares of the world, in the family of Sir Thomas Abney, and his worthy de&s;cendants, at Newington in Middle&s;ex. John&s;on's &s;ituation, in Mr. Thrale's family, was not &s;o con&s;tant and uninterrupted as was that of the per&s;ons above-men|tioned in their &s;everal abodes; but, in re&s;pect of the liberties al|lowed him, and the kindne&s;s with which he was treated, the com|pari&s;on is no way to the di&s;advantage of this his friend.</P></NOTE>.

Be&s;ides the conveniences for &s;tudy, with which he was furni&s;hed at Streatham, he had opportunities of exerci&s;e, and the plea&s;ure of airings and excur&s;ions. He was once prevailed on by Mr. Thrale to join in

In the exerci&s;e of a coach he had great delight; it afforded him the indulgence of indolent po&s;tures, and, as I di&s;covered when I have had him in my own, the noi&s;e of it a&s;&s;i&s;ted his hearing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In Dr. Pope's Wi&s;h.

<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed but that the&s;e indulgences were a great relief to John&s;on in his declining years; they, neverthele&s;s, indi&s;po&s;ed him for meditation and reflection; and, as he has noted in his diary, a&s;&s;igning for the rea&s;on the irregularity of the family, it broke his habit of early ri&s;ing, which he had per&s;i&s;ted in from new-year's day 1765, to about the mid&s;ummer following<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline"><P>'March 3.

<P>About this time, John&s;on had the honour of a con|ver&s;ation with his maje&s;ty, in the library, at the queen's hou&s;e. Whether the occa&s;ion of it was accidental, or otherwi&s;e, I have never been informed; but from this account of it, given by him, it afforded him great &s;a|tisfaction. He &s;poke to me of the king's behaviour, in terms of the highe&s;t gratitude and approbation, and de&s;cribed it as equalling in grace and conde&s;cen|&s;ion what might have been expected from Lewis the fourteenth, when the manners of the French court were in the highe&s;t &s;tate of cultivation. The public are already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hand&s;ome compliment which his maje&s;ty made him; I will, neverthele&s;s, give it here a place: he a&s;ked John&s;on, if he intended to give the world any more of his compo&s;itions; John&s;on an&s;wered, he believed he &s;hould not, for that he thought he had written enough; <Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould have thought &s;o too,' replied his maje&s;ty, 'if you had not written &s;o well<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Many &s;ayings of princes have been thought worthy of re|cording.

After the defeat at Culloden, he, with his wife, went to court, where being &s;een by the king, who had noticed Mrs. Thornton, he was thus acco&s;ted by the monarch: <Q REND="inline">'Mr. Thornton, I have been told of the &s;ervices you have rendered to your country, and your attachment to me and my family, and have held my&s;elf ob|liged to you for both; but I was never able to e&s;timate the degree of the obligation till now that I &s;ee the lady whom you left behind you.'</Q></P></NOTE>.'</Q></P>

John&s;on was now approaching towards &s;ixty. He was an exact computer of time, and, as his e&s;&s;ays abundantly &s;hew, regretted deeply the lap&s;e of tho&s;e minutes that could not be recalled, and though, in his own judgment of him&s;elf, he had been criminal in the wa&s;te of it, he was ever re&s;olving to &s;ubtract from his &s;leep tho&s;e hours which are fitte&s;t for &s;tudy and meditation. Numberle&s;s are the re&s;olutions that I meet with in his diaries, for a &s;eries of years back, to ri&s;e at eight; but he was unable, for any long conti|nuance, to perform them, a weakne&s;s, le&s;s inexcu&s;able than he thought it, for he was ever a bad &s;leeper, and was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of his infirmity, in that re&s;pect, to have allayed his &s;crupulo&s;ity, had he not been a mo&s;t rigorous judge of his actions. To im|pre&s;s the more &s;trongly on his mind the value of time, and the u&s;e it behoved every wi&s;e man to make of it, he indulged him&s;elf in an article of luxury, which, as far as my ob&s;ervation and remembrance will &s;erve me, he never enjoyed till this late period of his li&s;e: it was a watch, which he cau&s;ed to be made for him, in the year 1768, by tho&s;e eminent arti&s;ts Mudge and Dutton: it was of metal, and the outer ca&s;e covered with tortoi&s;e-&s;hell; he paid for it &s;eventeen guineas. On the dial-plate thereof, which
<PB N="461" REF="466">
was of enamel, he cau&s;ed to be in&s;cribed, in the ori|ginal Greek, the&s;e words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, chap. ix. v. 4.</NOTE>, but with the mi&s;take of a letter &mgr; for &ngr;: the meaning of them is, <Q REND="inline">'For the night cometh.'</Q> This, though a memento of great importance, he, about three years after, thought pedantic; he, there|fore, exchanged the dial-plate for one in which the in|&s;cription was omitted.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, 1768, upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the royal academy of painting, &s;culpture, &amp;c. John&s;on was nominated profe&s;&s;or of ancient literature, an of|fice merely honorary, and conferred on him, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, upon the recommendation of the pre&s;ident, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds.</P>
<P>In the variety of &s;ubjects on which he had exer|ci&s;ed his pen, John&s;on had hitherto forborne to med|dle with the di&s;putes of contending factions, which is all, that, at this day, is to be under&s;tood by the word politics. He was ever a friend to government, in a general &s;en&s;e of the term, as knowing what be|nefits &s;ociety derives from it; and was never tempted to write on the &s;ide of what is called oppo&s;ition, but at a period of his life, when experience had not enabled him to judge of the motives which induce men to a&s;&s;ume the characters of patriots. In the year 1769, he &s;aw with indignation the methods which, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Wilkes, were taken to work upon the po|pulace, and, in 1770, publi&s;hed a pamphlet, intitled, <Q REND="inline">'The fal&s;e alarm,'</Q> wherein he a&s;&s;erts, and labours to &s;hew, by a variety of arguments founded on prece|dents, that the expul&s;ion of a member of the hou&s;e of
<PB N="462" REF="467">
commons, for &s;uch offences as he had been convicted of, was both ju&s;t and &s;ea&s;onable, and that no &s;uch calamity as the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution, was to be feared from an act, that had u&s;age, which is the law of parliament, to warrant it. The non-acquie&s;|cence of the people intere&s;ted in the que&s;tion, is there|fore branded by him with folly and madne&s;s, in the following animated expre&s;&s;ions:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Every artifice of &s;edition has been &s;ince practi&s;ed to awaken di&s;con|tent, and inflame indignation. The papers of every day have been filled with the exhortations and me|naces of faction.

<P>To ridicule the conduct of oppo&s;ition, he adopts a term, invented by the leaders thereof, and calls the conjuncture of events, at the time of which he is &s;peaking, an <HI>alarming cri&s;is,</HI> but endeavours to abate the fears of its termination, by alluding to parliamen|tary deci&s;ions apparently partial, and &s;ometimes op|pre&s;&s;ive; and &s;hewing, that the vexation excited by inju&s;tice, &s;uffered, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;uffered, by any private man or &s;ingle community, was local and tem|porary. This po&s;ition he illu&s;trates by the following ob&s;ervation: <Q REND="inline">'We have found by experience, that though a &s;quire has given ale and veni&s;on in vain, and a borough has been compelled to &s;ee its deare&s;t intere&s;ts in the hands of him whom it did not tru&s;t, yet the general &s;tate of the nation has continued the &s;ame. The &s;un has ri&s;en, and the corn has grown, and whatever talk has been of the danger of pro|perty,
<PB N="463" REF="468">
yet he that ploughed the field commonly reaped it, and he that built the hou&s;e was ma&s;ter of the door.'</Q></P>
<P>In a tone more grave, he addre&s;&s;es &s;uch as are ca|pable of conviction, and tells them&mdash;that <Q REND="inline">'they have as much happine&s;s as the condition of life will ea&s;ily receive; and that a government, of which an erro|neous, or unju&s;t, repre&s;entation of one county only, is the greate&s;t crime that intere&s;t can di&s;cover, or malice can upbraid, is a government approaching nearer to perfection than any that experience has &s;hewn, or hi&s;tory related.'</Q></P>
<P>The pamphlet concludes with &s;ome &s;hrewd re|marks on the &s;upport given to faction by the &s;ec|taries, and that frigid neutrality of the tories in this bu&s;ine&s;s, which he cen&s;ures in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">'They do not yet con&s;ider that they have at la&s;t a king, who knows not the name of a party, and who wi&s;hes to be the common father of his people.'</Q></P>
<P>It was not to be imagined, that a publication, &s;o unpopular as this, would long remain unan&s;wered. Of many an&s;wers to it, one alone &s;eemed to John&s;on worthy of a reply; but, in a con&s;ultation with his friends, he was advi&s;ed to forbear. Had he engaged in a vindication of <Q REND="inline">'The fal&s;e alarm,'</Q> the world might po&s;&s;ibly have been entertained with a &s;peci|men of his abilities in controver&s;ial writing, in which there is little doubt that he would have di&s;played the temper and per&s;picuity of Hooker, the &s;trength of Chillingworth, and the dexterity of Hoadly, though, in truth, he was no friend to controver&s;y;
<PB N="464" REF="469">
his opinion on that &s;ubject being, that it &s;eldom produced conviction, that an impotent argument again&s;t a book was be&s;t re&s;uted by &s;ilence, and that it is want of policy to give immortality to that which mu&s;t of it&s;elf expire.</P>
<P>In the next &s;ucceeding year, a &s;ubject of more general importance to the intere&s;ts of this country engaged his attention: it was a que&s;tion between us and the court of Spain, touching the pre-di&s;covery, and, con&s;equently, the right of dominion over certain i&s;lands in the South &s;eas, known to us by the name of Pepys's or Falkland's i&s;lands, and to the Spa|niards by that of the Malouines, &s;pots of earth &s;o incon&s;iderable, as John&s;on a&s;&s;erts, that in the de&s;ert of the ocean they had almo&s;t e&s;caped human notice; and which, if they had not happened to make a &s;ea|mark, had perhaps never had a name. Lord An&s;on, in his voyage, had noticed the&s;e i&s;lands, and the re|lator thereof had recommended them as nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of any future expedition again&s;t the coa&s;t of Chili, and, of &s;uch importance, that the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of them would produce many advantages in peace; and in war would make us ma&s;ters of the South &s;ea. In 1748, our mini&s;try &s;ent out a few &s;loops, for a fuller knowledge of Pepy's and Falk|land's i&s;lands, and for further di&s;coveries in the South &s;ea; but, upon a remon&s;trance of Wall, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador here, maintaining the right of his ma&s;ter to the exclu&s;ive dominion of the South &s;ea, they relinqui&s;hed part of their original de&s;ign, and our purpo&s;e of &s;ettling there was di&s;owned. Thus the matter re&s;ted, till lord Egmont was appointed to the
<PB N="465" REF="470">
direction of our naval operations, who, in the year 1765, &s;ent out an expedition, the commander whereof took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Falkland's i&s;land in the name of his Britannic maje&s;ty, and placed a garri&s;on in a place of defence, to which he gave the appellation of Port Egmont. In this &s;ettlement, we were &s;oon after di&s;|turbed; for Madariaga, a Spani&s;h commodore, with five frigates and a train of artillery, appearing before the i&s;land, obliged our people to capitulate, and ob|tained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. This event was no &s;ooner known at our court, than ho&s;tilities again&s;t Spain were re|&s;olved on, and a powerful fleet was a&s;&s;embled: the&s;e preparations brought on a conference between prince Ma&s;&s;erano, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador here, and our mi|ni&s;ter, and a &s;ub&s;equent negociation at Madrid, between Mr. Harris our mini&s;ter there, and the marquis Gri|maldi: the re&s;ult was, a di&s;avowal on the part of Spain of the violent enterpri&s;e of Buccarelli, the governor of Buenos Ayres, who had &s;ent the force that di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h, and a promi&s;e to re&s;tore the port and fort called Egmont, with all the artillery and &s;tores therein, but with a declaration, that this engagement &s;hould not affect the que&s;tion of the prior right of &s;overeignty of the Malouine, otherwi&s;e called Falkland's i&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The conference at London was with lord Rochford, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the &s;outhern department, who, in di&s;cour&s;e with me, gave an account of it to this effect, viz. that he repre|&s;ented to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, that the inflexibility of his court in this bu&s;ine&s;s had compelled us to arm, that our fleet was manned, and the officers and &s;ailors impatient for action; that the nation having incurred the expence of a naval equipment, would hardly be &s;atisfied without a trial of what it was able to effect; and that a refu&s;al of conce&s;&s;ions on the part of Spain would inevitably bring on a war between the two powers, which, as it would be confined to the &s;ea, mu&s;t prove a &s;hort one.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="471">
The acquie&s;cence of our court in the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions of that of Madrid, and the reference of a di&s;putable que&s;tion to the Greek calends, furni&s;hed the leaders of faction with a new topic for clamour, and war be|came the cry. The heavy burthen of debt, incurred by the la&s;t, was no rea&s;on again&s;t a new one, and mil|lions were to be expended, and thou&s;ands murdered, for the titular &s;overeignty of an i&s;land, which John&s;on thus &s;trongly and even poetically characteri&s;es:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'A bleak and gloomy &s;olitude, an i&s;land thrown a&s;ide from human u&s;e, &s;tormy in winter, and barren in &s;ummer: an i&s;land which not the &s;outhern &s;ava|ges have dignified with habitation; where a garri&s;on mu&s;t be kept in a &s;tate that contemplates with envy the exiles of Siberia; of which the expence will be perpetual, and the u&s;e only occa&s;ional, and which, if fortune &s;mile upon our labours, may become a ne&s;t of &s;mugglers in peace, and in war the future refuge of buccaniers.'</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are his &s;entiments re&s;pecting the incommo|dities of this conte&s;ted &s;ettlement: again&s;t the advan|tages &s;ugge&s;ted by the relator of An&s;on's expedition, whom he repre&s;ents as having written under the in|fluence of a heated imagination, he oppo&s;es the fol|lowing arguments, founded in true policy and &s;ound morality:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'That &s;uch a &s;ettlement may be of u&s;e in war, no man that con&s;iders its &s;ituation will deny. But war is not the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life; it happens but
<PB N="467" REF="472">
&s;eldom, and every man, either good or wi&s;e, wi&s;hes that its frequency were &s;till le&s;s. That conduct which betrays de&s;igns of future ho&s;tility, if it does not excite violence, will always generate malignity; it mu&s;t for ever exclude confidence and friend&s;hip, and continue a cold and &s;luggi&s;h rivalry, by a &s;ly reciprocation of indirect injuries, without the bra|very of war, or the &s;ecurity of peace.</P><P>'The advantage of &s;uch a &s;ettlement in time of peace is, I think, not ea&s;ily to be proved. For, what u&s;e can it have but of a &s;tation for contra|band traders, a nur&s;ery of fraud, and a receptacle of theft? Narborough, about a century ago, was of opinion, that no advantages could be obtained in voy|ages to the South &s;ea, except by &s;uch an armament as, with a &s;ailor's morality, <HI>might trade by force.</HI> It is well known, that the prohibitions of commerce are, in the&s;e countries, to the la&s;t degree, rigorous, and that no man, not authorized by the king of Spain, can trade there but by force or &s;tealth. Whatever profit is obtained, mu&s;t be gained by the violence of rapine, or dexterity of fraud.</P>
<P>'Government will not, perhaps, &s;oon arrive at &s;uch purity and excellence, but that &s;ome connivance at lea&s;t will be indulged to the triumphant robber and &s;ucce&s;sful cheat. He that brings wealth home, is &s;eldom interrogated by what means it was obtained. This, however, is one of tho&s;e modes of corruption with which mankind ought always to &s;truggle, and which they may, in time, hope to overcome. There is rea&s;on to expect, that as the world is more en|lightened, policy and morality will at la&s;t be recon|ciled,
<PB N="468" REF="473">
and that nations will learn not to do what they would not &s;uffer.</P>
<P>'But the &s;ilent toleration of &s;u&s;pected guilt is a degree of depravity far below that which openly in|cites and manife&s;tly protects it. To pardon a pi|rate may be injurious to mankind; but how much greater is the crime of opening a port in which all pirates will be &s;afe? The contraband trader is not more worthy of protection: if, with Narborough, he trades by force, he is a pirate; if he trades &s;ecretly, he is only a thief. Tho&s;e who hone&s;tly refu&s;e his traffic, he hates as ob&s;tructors of his profit; and tho&s;e with whom he deals he cheats, becau&s;e he knows that they dare not complain. He lives with a heart full of that malignity, which fear of detection always generates in tho&s;e who are to defend unju&s;t acqui&s;itions again&s;t lawful authority; and when he comes home with riches thus acquired, he brings a mind hardened in evil, too proud for reproof, and too &s;tupid for reflection; he offends the high by his in&s;olence, and corrupts the low by his ex|ample.'</P></Q></P>
<P>To &s;ilence this clamour, to defeat the purpo&s;es of a wicked and malevolent faction, to allay the thir&s;t for human blood, and to bring the deluded people to a &s;en&s;e of their true intere&s;t, was the aim of John&s;on in writing this mo&s;t judicious pamphlet: he &s;ucceeded in his endeavour, the mi&s;eries of war were averted, the contractors di&s;appointed, and a few months re&s;tored the populace to the u&s;e of their under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>In a review of the &s;everal particulars herein before related, it will appear, that John&s;on's cour&s;e of life
<PB N="469" REF="474">
was very uniform. London was a place of re&s;idence which he pre&s;erred to all others, as affording more intelligence, and better opportunities of conver&s;ation than were el&s;ewhere to be found, and he was but little delighted either with rural &s;cenes or manners. No|velty, and variety of occupations, it is true, were objects that engaged his attention, and from the&s;e he never failed to extract information. Though born and bred in a city, he well under&s;tood both the theory and prac|tice of agriculture, and even the management of a farm: he could de&s;cribe, with great accuracy, the pro|ce&s;s of malting; and, had nece&s;&s;ity driven him to it, could have thatched a dwelling. Of field recreations, &s;uch as hunting, &s;etting, and &s;hooting, he would di&s;|cour&s;e like a &s;port&s;man, though his per&s;onal defects rendered him, in a great mea&s;ure, incapable of de|riving plea&s;ure from any &s;uch exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>But he had taken a very comprehen&s;ive view of human life and manners, and, that he was well ac|quainted with the views and pur&s;uits of all cla&s;&s;es and characters of men, his writings abundantly &s;hew. This kind of knowledge he was ever de&s;irous of in|crea&s;ing, even as he advanced in years: to gratify it, he was acce&s;&s;ible to all comers, and yielded to the in|vitations of &s;uch of his friends as had re&s;idences in the country, to vary his cour&s;e of living, and pa&s;s the plea&s;anter months of the year in the &s;hades of ob|&s;curity.</P>
<P>In the&s;e vi&s;its, where there were children in the family, he took great delight in examining them as to their progre&s;s in learning, or, to make u&s;e of a

<P>The We&s;tern i&s;lands of Scotland are called by the ancient geographers, the Aebudae and Hebrides.

<P>The defects of Martin, in the accounts given by him of the Hebrides, and the inhabitants of the &s;e|veral i&s;les &s;o called, are amply &s;upplied by a late traveller thither, Mr. Pennant, who, in the years 1769 and 1772 made the tour of Scotland, and, with a curious and penetrating eye remarked all that &s;eems to have been worthy of notice, re&s;pecting either the &s;ituation of the &s;pots by him de&s;cribed, or the people whom nece&s;&s;ity has doomed, or par|ticular circum&s;tances have led, to become dwellers there.</P>

The civil con&s;titution of the&s;e &s;everal tracts of land, for countries they are not to be called, is uniform:

it is feudatory, and of this the many ca&s;tles and places of defence, every where vi&s;ible among them, in which their lords and chieftains re&s;ide, are evident proofs. In extent of land they differ greatly: Sky, the large&s;t of them, is above &s;ixty mea&s;ured miles long; but, the greater number of them are le&s;s than four miles in length, and two in breadth. Iona, or Icolmkill, is but two miles long and one broad, yet, it was once an epi&s;copal &s;eat, and had on it a cathedral and a place of &s;epulture, in which no fewer than forty-eight Scotti&s;h, eight Norwegian, and four Iri&s;h kings, are interred; and al&s;o, two mona&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, the one for men, the other for women: the ruins of the&s;e edifices are yet remaining, and may be &s;een, accurately delineated, in Mr. Pennant's <Q REND="inline">'Tour in Scotland, and Voyage to the Hebrides,'</Q> made in 1772, and publi&s;hed in 1774.

Of the i&s;land he &s;ays, that it is two miles long, one broad, and five in circumference, and is one hard rock, with earth from &s;ix inches to three foot deep; but with not a tree, nor even a &s;hrub thereon. Of the inhabitants, and their manner of living, he gives a de|&s;cription, which, being abridged, has furni&s;hed the following account. They are computed at about one hundred and eighty: they ob&s;erve the chri&s;tian Sabbath, and believe in God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and have three chapels covered with thatch, and in one of them a brazen crucifix, on which they &s;wear, and contract matrimony: they &s;peak the Er&s;e language, are cha|ritable to each other, and &s;hew great humanity to &s;hipwrecked &s;trangers. The head of the Mac-Leod family is the proprietor of the i&s;land, who governs it by his &s;teward. Though they have &s;heep and a few oxen, their chief food is Solan gee&s;e and their eggs, both which they come at by climbing the rocks at the peril of their lives: to take them they are &s;u&s;pended from the precipices by ropes of an immen&s;e length, covered with &s;alted cow-hides, of which there are only three on the i&s;land, which are the joint pro|perty of all the dwellers thereon. When they climb the rocks, it is with their elbows, their backs being to the rock. The dre&s;s of the women is partly linen, and partly plaid: they wear &s;hoes only in winter, and tho&s;e the &s;kins of the neck of the Solan goo&s;e; that part which covers the head of the fowl &s;erving for the heel. Their bread is made of barley or oats, and their drink water or whey. They have only one &s;teel and tinder-box on the whole i&s;land, and that is private property.

The mechani&s;m of the coach-wheel, and its running about, was the greate&s;t of all his wonders.</P><P>'When he went through the &s;treets, he de&s;ired to have one to lead him by the hand. Thomas Ro&s;s a merchant, and others, that took the diver&s;ion to carry him through the town, a&s;ked his opinion of the high church. He an&s;wered, that it was a large rock, yet, there were &s;ome in St. Kilda much higher, but that the&s;e were the be&s;t caves he ever &s;aw; for that was the idea which he conceived of the pillars and arches upon which the church &s;tands, When they carried him into the church, he was yet more &s;urpri&s;ed, and held up his hands with admiration, wondering how it was po&s;&s;ible for men to build &s;uch a prodigious fabric, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t in the univer&s;e. He could not imagine what the pews were de&s;igned for, and he fancied the people that wore ma&s;ks, (not knowing whether they were men or women) had been guilty of &s;ome ill thing, for which they dared not &s;hew their faces. He was amazed at women's wearing patches, and fancied them to have been bli&s;|ters. Pendants &s;eemed to him the mo&s;t ridiculous of all things: he condemned perriwigs mightily, and much more the powder u&s;ed in them: in fine, he condemned all things as &s;uperfluous he &s;aw not in his own country. He looked with amazement on every thing that was new to him. When he heard the church bells ring, he was under a mighty con&s;ternation, as if the fabric of the world had been in great di&s;order. He did not think there had been &s;o many people in the world as in the city of Gla&s;gow; and it was a great my&s;tery to him to think what they could all de&s;ign by living &s;o many in one place. He wondered how they could all be furni&s;hed with provi&s;ion; and when he &s;aw big loaves, he could not tell whether they were bread, &s;tone, or wood. He was amazed to think how they could be provided with ale, for he never &s;aw any there that drank water. He wondered how they made them fine cloaths; and to &s;ee &s;tockings made without being fir&s;t cut, and afterwards &s;ewn, was no &s;mall wonder to him.

When he &s;aw the womens' feet, he judged them to be of another &s;hape than tho&s;e of the men, becau&s;e of the different &s;hape of their &s;hoes. He did not approve of the heels of &s;hoes worn by men or women; and, when he ob&s;erved hor&s;es with &s;hoes on their feet, and fa&s;tened with iron nails, he could not &s;orbear laughing, and thought it the mo&s;t ridiculous thing that ever fell under his ob&s;ervation.

man of his age, as his tour mu&s;t be thought, I will not enquire into: doubtle&s;s, curio&s;ity was one of them; but, it was curio&s;ity directed to no peculiar object. He was neither an antiquary nor a natura|li&s;t; he had little acquaintance with the trea&s;ures which lie below the &s;urface of the earth; and for the &s;tudy of botany he never di&s;covered the lea&s;t re|li&s;h. If any particular &s;ubject may be &s;aid to have engaged his attention, it mu&s;t have been the manners of a people of whom he knew little but by report, the knowledge whereof might furni&s;h him with new topics for reflection and di&s;qui&s;ition, an exerci&s;e of his mental powers which, of all others, he mo&s;t de|lighted in. That in this employment he has con|ducted him&s;elf with that impartiality which becomes a lover of truth, the natives of the kingdom he vi&s;ited deny; and, that he carried out of this country the tem|per of a man who hoped for an ho&s;pitable reception among &s;trangers, few are &s;o hardy as to a&s;&s;ert. Accord|ingly, we find in his narrative an intermixture, not only of prai&s;e and blame, but of gratitude and invective.</P>
<P>The volume which this tour gave birth to may pro|perly be called a di&s;&s;ertation, for it has &s;carcely any facts, and con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in propo&s;itions which he hunts down, and enlivens with amu&s;ing di&s;qui&s;ition. As he &s;ays him&s;elf, on another occa&s;ion, the negative cata|logue of particulars is very copious: what he did not &s;ee, what he could not learn, what he would not believe, what he did not enquire about, and what he is not &s;ure of, altogether form a con&s;iderable enumeration. Yet the merit of this tract is great; for, though I will admit that no one going his route could derive from him direction or intelligence; though no remembrance

could be refre&s;hed, nor remarks corroborated; be|cau&s;e his web was &s;pun, not from objects that pre|&s;ented them&s;elves to his view, but from his own pre|exi&s;tent ideas; I am convinced, that every body mu&s;t have regretted the omi&s;&s;ion, had he, for any rea&s;on, withheld &s;o entertaining a &s;eries of reflections.</P>
<P>A reference to the work will di&s;cover both the cau&s;e and effect of the confined ob&s;ervation that mu&s;t be remarked in it: he pofe&s;&s;es his views to be directed to life and manners: of the former, if taken in its general &s;en&s;e, he could obtain a very ina|dequate knowledge who was entertained by the opu|lent, at the be&s;t hou&s;es, with the be&s;t fare of the country, and who, while he &s;uffered no inconveni|ence within doors, enquired after little without; and, of the latter he could gain little information, for the manners he mo&s;t clo&s;ely ob&s;erved were imported from the places where &s;outhern elegance is taught. His known love of ea&s;e precluded him from intelligence: all deficiencies by which he could &s;uffer, the natural ho&s;pitality of tho&s;e to whom he was a gue&s;t, tempo|rarily &s;upplied or concealed, and happy was it for him that he found not the &s;ame prejudices that he carried with him.</P>
<P>In all John&s;on's di&s;qui&s;itions, whether argumentative or critical, there is a certain even-handed ju&s;tice that leaves the mind in a &s;trange perplexity. When he &s;peaks of the paucity of trees in Scotland, his indig|nation &s;eems excited at the &s;upinene&s;s it manife&s;ted. He &s;ays&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'to drop a &s;eed into the ground can co&s;t nothing, and the trouble is not great of protecting the young plant till it is out of danger.'&mdash;</Q>In this the reader willingly acquie&s;ces, and wonders, with

John&s;on, that plantation is neglected, till he is told in the conclu&s;ion of the paragraph, that it mu&s;t be al|lowed difficult, where there is neither wood for pali|&s;ades, nor thorns for hedges. He again, in a &s;ub&s;e|quent page, re&s;umes the &s;ame kind of &s;atirical admi|ration, which he balances by ob&s;erving, that the land which covers future fore&s;ts cannot be arable. This al&s;o is &s;atisfactory: the que&s;tion of fir&s;t importance certainly is&mdash;Where &s;hall <HI>corn</HI> grow?&mdash;no one will deny, that food mu&s;t be &s;ecured, before the delights of foliage, or the emoluments of timber are thought of. But all our wonder and regret at national inac|tivity, is di&s;&s;ipated, when we are told, that Sir James Macdonald had made an experiment by planting &s;everal millions of trees, which the want of fences to keep the cattle off, had rendered abortive. Thus it is that he frequently rai&s;es an edifice, which appears founded and &s;upported to re&s;i&s;t any attack; and then, with the next &s;troke, annihilates it, and leaves the va|cuity he found.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the inaccuracy he has been charged with, it mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice, be imputed to the defect of his perceptions: he neither &s;aw nor heard clearly; and, though this might be urged again&s;t his attempt|ing to relate what he had met with or been told, it mu&s;t be admitted in excu&s;e for any mi&s;-repre&s;enta|tion; &s;ince no one could acquire credit by doubting the uniform veracity of John&s;on. He candidly con|fe&s;&s;es his inability, whenever he &s;u&s;pected it; and owns, that his thoughts are the thoughts of one who has &s;een little.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could as readily apologize for the manner in which he &s;peaks of the people of that part of Scot|land
<PB N="484" REF="489">
he vi&s;ited. He &s;eems to think a barren &s;oil di&s;graceful to the proprietors; and his aver&s;ion is mo&s;t excited, where he finds the comforts of life mo&s;t &s;paringly be&s;towed: where he meets with refinement, he is placid, and is unwilling to depart from elegance; but, when he is di&s;plea&s;ed, or un&s;atisfied, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with a keenne&s;s of &s;atire, which, however it may delight by its poignancy, is not to be ju&s;tified; and I have rea&s;on to think very highly, not only of the kindne&s;s which con&s;ulted his humour, but of that temper and forbearance which re&s;trained tho&s;e per&s;ons who, while they were endeavouring to gratify him, received indubitable proof of his antipathy to their country.</P>
<P>But it is due to him to take notice, that in civility he has pre&s;erved the &s;ame equilibrium as in argu|ment. If he has &s;tigmatized Scotland as a country, and the Scots as a people, his compliments to indi|viduals, in &s;ome mea&s;ure atone for it: they are judi|cious, elegant, and well conceived, and expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of gratitude proportioned to the favours he experienced.</P>
<P>I will not repeat, for I do not wi&s;h to perpetuate, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that have given di&s;gu&s;t. I have ever e&s;teemed the Scots as a brave, u&s;eful, and virtuous people, and &s;hould be very &s;orry if they imagined John&s;on's prejudices common to their &s;outhern neighbours. If, in his journey acro&s;s their continent, he had remembered, that a very commendable and well-directed &s;pirit of literary indu&s;try had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them, and, when among the Hebridians, that a perpetual &s;truggle again&s;t difficulties, and a pa|tient toleration of irremediable evils, is eminently
<PB N="485" REF="490">
laudable, I am per&s;uaded he would have written with le&s;s a&s;perity, and that his remarks would not have given that offence which I cannot but own well founded.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s to be lamented, that he left not behind him tho&s;e prejudices again&s;t the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tab|li&s;hment of Scotland and the religious per&s;ua&s;ion of the people, which, though in England they gave little offence, could not, in that kingdom, be indulged without the &s;u&s;picion of bigotry. It is pretty well agreed that, between the church of England and that of Scotland, the que&s;tions in di&s;pute relate not to doctrines, but to di&s;cipline, which, in the judgment of many &s;ober per&s;ons, is numbered among things indifferent. Being in a country of which Chri&s;tianity, in its utmo&s;t purity, is the religion, it might have been expected, that John&s;on, with a true catholic &s;pirit, and as a te&s;timony of re&s;pect for their teachers, would occa&s;ionally have been pre&s;ent at divine &s;ervice in their churches; but his narrative contains not the lea&s;t hint of any &s;uch compliance, though he has noted his joining in public wor&s;hip at the Engli&s;h non-juring epi&s;copal chapel at Aberdeen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this conde&s;cen&s;ion he would have had the example of Mr. Richard Baxter, a man whom he profe&s;&s;ed to admire, who, as I have been credibly informed, to te&s;tify his charity towards tho&s;e from whom he di&s;&s;ented in opinion, was wont, once in every year, to communicate with the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.</NOTE>.</P>

that he did &s;o is certain; and it mu&s;t be attributed to the gratification he felt in the re&s;pect that had been paid to him, in &s;eeing the celebrity he had acquired, and in increa&s;ing the &s;tock of his ideas.</P>
<P>Had John&s;on been more explicit in his acknow|ledgments of the ho&s;pitable and courteous treatment he experienced from a people, who had rea&s;on to look on him rather as a &s;py than a traveller, and might have &s;aid to him&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'To di&s;cover the naked|ne&s;s of the land are ye come,'&mdash;</Q>he would have given a proof, that he had, in &s;ome degree, overcome his prejudices again&s;t them and their country; but they &s;eemed to be unconquerable.</P>
<P>One of the la&s;t duties we learn, is that of con&s;i|dering mankind as one great family, and the natives of foreign countries, however differing from us in opinions, manners, cu&s;toms, and other particulars, as &s;tanding in the &s;ame relation with our&s;elves to the common Father of us all: a duty which leads us, as Thomp&s;on elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, to</P>

<P>John&s;on's prejudices were too &s;trong to permit him to extend his philanthropy much beyond the limits of his native country, and the pale of his own church; and, that he was unable to conquer his habits of think|ing and judging, is the only apology that can be offered for his a&s;perity towards the people who&s;e country and manners he, in his journey above &s;poken of, has taken upon him to de&s;cribe; or that he has forborne to di&s;play any &s;uch generous &s;entiments re&s;pecting the inhabitants of Scotland as others have done who have vi&s;ited that country.</P>

In the clo&s;e of his book he might have at large expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;en&s;e of gratitude for the many courte&s;ies that had been &s;hewn him.

<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, as it was a circum&s;tance that gave him &s;ome trouble after his return to England, that during his &s;tay in the Hebrides, John&s;on was very indu&s;trious in his enquiries touching the Ear&s;e language, with a view to a&s;certain the degree of credit due to certain poems then lately publi&s;hed and a&s;|cribed to O&s;&s;ian, an ancient bard, who, till then, had &s;carce been heard of.

<P>No &s;ooner did this &s;trong and unequivocal de|claration of John&s;on's opinion of the poems of O&s;&s;ian appear, than Mr. James Macpher&s;on, the publi&s;her of them, not only repelled the charge of forgery therein contained, but, in a letter to the author of it, threatened him with corporal cha&s;ti&s;ement. If Mr. Macpher&s;on had known his man, he would pro|bably have forborne the thought of &s;uch a revenge. To &s;hew his contempt of him and all that he was able to do that could hurt him, John&s;on returned the following brief but &s;pirited an&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER>

<OPENER><DATE>No date.</DATE> <SALUTE>Mr. JAMES MACPHERSON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received your fooli&s;h and impudent letter.&mdash;Any violence that &s;hall be attempted upon me, I will do my be&s;t to repel; and what I cannot do for my&s;elf, the law &s;hall do for me; for I will not be hindered from expo&s;ing what I think a cheat, by the menaces of a ruffian. What would you have me retract? I thought your work an impo&s;ition; I think &s;o &s;till; and, for my opinion, I have given rea&s;ons which I here dare you to refute.&mdash;Your abilities, &s;ince your Homer, are not &s;o formidable; and, what I hear of your morality, inclines me to credit rather what you &s;hall prove, than what you &s;hall &s;ay.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Whether John&s;on was apprehen&s;ive that his adver|&s;ary would put his threat in execution, or that he meant to &s;hew all who came to &s;ee him, that he &s;tood upon his guard, he provided him&s;elf with a weapon, both of the defen&s;ive and offen&s;ive kind. It was an oak-plant of a tremendous &s;ize; a plant, I &s;ay, and not a &s;hoot or branch, for it had had a root, which being trimmed to the &s;ize of a large orange, became the head of it. Its height was upwards of &s;ix feet, and from about an inch in diameter at the lower end, increa&s;ed to near three: this he kept in his bed-chamber, &s;o near the chair in which he con|&s;tantly &s;at, as to be within reach.</P>
<P>But this precaution for his defence turned out to be unnece&s;&s;ary. John&s;on's letter, above in&s;erted, put an end to the di&s;pute between him and Macpher&s;on; but, by other per&s;ons, it was continued with a degree of a&s;perity equal to that which was &s;hewn in the con|trover&s;y
<PB N="492" REF="497">
concerning the genuinene&s;s of Phalaris's epi&s;tles, and with as much acutene&s;s as that which tended to a&s;certain the que&s;tion, whether the poems lately a&s;cribed to Rowlie are not forgeries. Mode|rators have al&s;o interpo&s;ed, as there did in the di&s;pute about the authenticity of the Sybilline oracles, and with as little &s;ucce&s;s: the world remains, and is likely ever to remain, without &s;atisfaction in re&s;pect of either the one or the other.</P>
<P>Before this time, John&s;on had undertaken to revi&s;e the former edition of his Shake&s;peare, and extend his plan, by admitting the corrections and illu&s;trations of various other commentators. He therefore, in con|junction with Mr. George Steevens, publi&s;hed in 1773, a new edition of that author, in ten octavo volumes, which was republi&s;hed with additions in 1778.</P>
<P>In 1774, the parliament having been di&s;&s;olved, and Mr. Wilkes per&s;i&s;ting in his endeavours to be|come a repre&s;entative in that which was about to be cho&s;en, John&s;on addre&s;&s;ed to the electors of Great Britain a pamphlet, entitled <Q REND="inline">'The Patriot;'</Q> the de|&s;ign whereof is to guard them from impo&s;ition, and teach them to di&s;tingui&s;h that which, of it&s;elf &s;eems &s;ufficiently obvious, the difference between true and fal&s;e patrioti&s;m; but the madne&s;s of the people was then at its height, and they needed to be told how often in their lucid intervals they had lamented the deceits practi&s;ed on them by artful and de&s;igning men. With this view, he de&s;cribes a patriot, as one who&s;e public conduct is regulated by one &s;ingle mo|tive, the love of his country; who, as an agent in parliament, has, for him&s;elf, neither hope nor fear, neither kindne&s;s nor re&s;entment, but refers every
<PB N="493" REF="498">
thing to the common intere&s;t. The&s;e, and other marks of patrioti&s;m by him pointed out, he allows to be &s;uch as artifice may counterfeit, or folly mi&s;|apply; but he enumerates &s;everal characteri&s;tical modes of &s;peaking and acting, which may prove a man not to be a patriot; which di&s;crimination he illu&s;trates in &s;undry in&s;tances, by pointed references to the conduct of many of tho&s;e men who were courting the favour of the people: the&s;e, an abridg|ment would injure, and I therefore give them in his own words: <Q REND="inline">'It may &s;afely be pronounced, that tho&s;e men are no patriots, who, when the nati|onal honour was vindicated in the &s;ight of Europe, and the Spaniards having invaded what they call their own, had &s;hrunk to a di&s;avowal of their at|tempt, and a relaxation of their claim, would &s;till have in&s;tigated us to a war for a bleak and barren &s;pot in the Magellanic ocean, of which no u&s;e could be made, unle&s;s it were a place of exile for the hy|pocrites of patrioti&s;m.&mdash;He that wi&s;hes to &s;ee his country robbed of its rights, cannot be a pa|triot. That man, therefore, is no patriot, who ju&s;tifies the ridiculous claims of American u&s;ur|pation; who endeavours to deprive the nation of its natural and lawful authority over its own colo|nies, tho&s;e colonies which were &s;ettled under Eng|li&s;h protection, were con&s;tituted by an Engli&s;h char|ter, and have been defended by Engli&s;h arms. To &s;uppo&s;e, that, by &s;ending out a colony, the nation e&s;tabli&s;hed an independent power; that when, by indulgence and favour, emigrants are become rich, they &s;hall not contribute to their own defence, but at their own plea&s;ure, and that they &s;hall not be
<PB N="494" REF="499">
included, like millions of their fellow &s;ubjects, in the general &s;y&s;tem of repre&s;entation, involves &s;uch an accumulation of ab&s;urdity, as nothing but the &s;hew of patrioti&s;m would palliate.'&mdash;</Q>His la&s;t de|&s;ignation of the cla&s;s of men whom he means to &s;tig|mati&s;e, is the following:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'That man is not a pa|triot, who denies his governors their due prai&s;e, and who conceals from the public the benefits which they receive. Tho&s;e, therefore, can lay no claim to this illu&s;trious appellation, who impute want of public &s;pirit to the late parliament; an a&s;&s;embly of men, whom, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome fluctuations of coun&s;el, and &s;ome weakne&s;s of agency, the nation mu&s;t always remember with gratitude, &s;ince it is indebted to them for a very ample conce&s;&s;ion in the re&s;ignation of protections, and a wi&s;e and hone&s;t attempt to improve the con&s;titution, in the new judi|cature in&s;tituted to try elections.'</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on publi&s;hed al&s;o in 1775, a pamphlet intitled, <Q REND="inline">'Taxation no Tyranny,'</Q> an an&s;wer to the re&s;olutions and addre&s;s of the American congre&s;s; in which, as the ground of his argument, he a&s;&s;umes as &s;elf-evident, the following propo&s;ition: <Q REND="inline">'In all the parts of human knowledge, whether terminating in &s;cience merely &s;peculative, or operating upon life private or civil, are admitted &s;ome fundamental principls, or common axioms, which, being gene|rally received, are little doubted, and being little doubted, have been rarely proved.<P>'Of the&s;e gratuitous and acknowledged truths, it is often the fate to become le&s;s evident by en|deavours to explain them, however nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch endeavours may be made by the mi&s;apprehen&s;ions

of ab&s;urdity, or the &s;ophi&s;tries of intere&s;t. It is difficult to prove the principles of &s;cience, becau&s;e notions cannot always be found more intelligible than tho&s;e which are que&s;tioned. It is difficult to prove the principles of practice, becau&s;e they have, for the mo&s;t part, not been di&s;covered by inve&s;ti|gation, but obtruded by experience; and the de|mon&s;trator will find, after an opero&s;e deduction, that he has been trying to make that &s;een, which can be only felt.</P>
<P>'Of this kind is the po&s;ition that <HI>the &s;upreme power of every community has the right of requiring from all its &s;ubjects, &s;uch contributions as are nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety or public pro&s;perity,</HI> which was con&s;i|dered by all mankind as compri&s;ing the primary and e&s;&s;ential condition of all political &s;ociety, till it became di&s;puted by tho&s;e zealots of anarchy, who have denied to the parliament of Britain the right of taxing the American colonies.'</P></Q></P>
<P>With much wit does he ridicule, and with force of rea&s;oning refute, the arguments founded on the in|ability of the Americans to bear taxation, their powers of re&s;i&s;tance, the &s;tubbornne&s;s of their tempers, and the profits accruing to this country by its commerce with them: the&s;e, he tells us, are u&s;ed only as auxiliaries to that other, which, as he briefly &s;tates it, is&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'that to tax the colonies is u&s;urpation and oppre&s;&s;ion, an in|va&s;ion of natural and legal rights, and a violation of tho&s;e principles which &s;upport the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government.'</Q></P>
<P>He next con&s;iders the legal con&s;equences of migra|tion from a mother-country, and afterwards proceeds to an examination of that fallacious po&s;ition, that from
<PB N="496" REF="501">
an Engli&s;hman nothing can be taken but by his own con&s;ent, and of the argument grounded thereon, that the Americans, being unrepre&s;ented in parliament, cannot be &s;aid to have con&s;ented in their corporate capacity, and that, refu&s;ing their con&s;ent as individuals, they cannot legally be taxed.</P>
<P>Of this he &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline">'it is a po&s;ition of a mighty &s;ound, but that every man that utters it, with what|ever confidence, and every man that hears it, with whatever acquie&s;cence, if con&s;ent be &s;uppo&s;ed to imply the power of refu&s;al, feels to be fal&s;e, for that, in wide extended dominions, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the pub|lic mu&s;t be done by delegation, and the choice of delegates is by a &s;elect number of electors, who are often far from unanimity in their choice; and where the numbers approach to equality, almo&s;t half mu&s;t be governed, not only without, but again&s;t their choice.'</Q> Of tho&s;e, who are not electors, he &s;ays:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'they &s;tand idle and helple&s;s &s;pectators of the common|weal, wholly unconcerned in the government of them|&s;elves.'</Q> The re&s;olution of the Congre&s;s, that their an|ce&s;tors, who fir&s;t &s;ettled the colonies, were, at the time of their emigration from the mother-country, entitled to all the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and natural-born &s;ubjects within the realm of England, he admits; but granting it, he contends, that their boa&s;t of original rights is at an end, and that, by their emi|gration, they &s;unk down into coloni&s;ts, governed by a charter; and that though, by &s;uch emigration, they had not forfeited, &s;urrendered, or lo&s;t, any of tho&s;e rights, they had lo&s;t them by natural effects, that is to &s;ay, had abandoned them.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'A man,' &s;ays he, 'can be but in one place at once; he cannot have the ad|vantages

<P>He next con&s;iders the legal operation of charters, and forgets not to note, that from the exemption of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's bay from taxes for &s;even years, it mu&s;t be inferred, that at the end thereof they were liable to taxation.</P>
<P>It is not my purpo&s;e to give at length the &s;everal arguments contained in this mo&s;t excellent pamphlet. I &s;hall, therefore, content my&s;elf with extracting from it a few pa&s;&s;ages, which &s;tand di&s;tingui&s;hed from others, either by their wit, or the &s;trength of rea&s;oning di&s;played in them. Of that cla&s;s are the&s;e that follow:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'To be prejudiced is always to be weak; yet there are prejudices &s;o near to laudable, that they have often been prai&s;ed, and are always pardoned. To love their country has been con&s;idered as virtue in men who&s;e love could not be otherwi&s;e than blind, becau&s;e their preference was made without compa|ri&s;on; but it has never been my fortune to find, either in ancient or modern writers, any honourable mention of tho&s;e who have, with equal blindne&s;s, hated their country.</P><P><PB N="498" REF="503">
'The&s;e anti-patriotic prejudices are the abortions of folly, impregnated by faction, which, being pro|duced again&s;t the &s;tanding order of nature, have not &s;trength &s;ufficient for long life.

<P>To the menaces of the heroes of Bo&s;ton, that they would leave their town and be free, rather than &s;ubmit to the &s;tamp-act, in which ca&s;e he &s;ays, they would leave good hou&s;es to wi&s;er men, he oppo&s;es this &s;ober advice:</P>

'To treat &s;uch de&s;igns as &s;erious, would be to think too contemptibly of Bo&s;tonian under&s;tandings. The artifice, indeed, is not new: the blu&s;terer who threatened in vain his opponent, has &s;ometimes ob|tained his end, by making it believed he would hang him&s;elf.'</P></Q></P>
<P>In a more &s;erious &s;train of rea&s;oning, he thus argues: <Q REND="inline">'Our colonies, however di&s;tant, have been hitherto treated as con&s;tituent parts of the Briti&s;h empire. The inhabitants, incorporated by Engli&s;h charters, are entitled to all the rights of Engli&s;hmen.

<P>The above citations are evidences of John&s;on's &s;kill in political controver&s;y, and are but &s;light &s;pe|cimens of that &s;pecies of oratory which delights the ear, and convinces the under&s;tanding. With re&s;pect to logical preci&s;ion, and &s;trength of argument, the tracts, from whence they are &s;everally taken, defy all com|pari&s;on; and, as they abound in wit, and di&s;cover nothing of that acrimony which di&s;graces former controver&s;ies, the Di&s;ciplinarian and Bangorian not excepted, may be con&s;idered as &s;tanding exemplars of polemical eloquence, and political ratiocination.</P>
<P>The friends of &s;edition and rebellion were highly exa&s;perated again&s;t John&s;on for his interfering, by the&s;e publications, in the debate of political que&s;tions: they were provoked to &s;ee &s;uch talents as his employed in expo&s;ing the malignity of faction, and detecting
<PB N="500" REF="505">
the artifices of tho&s;e, who, by &s;pecious oratory and fal&s;e rea&s;oning, were courting popularity, and deluding the inhabitants of this country into a re&s;ignation of their rights.

<P>But John&s;on was of another mind: he was con|&s;cious of his own abilities, and felt within him&s;elf &s;uch powers of rea&s;oning, &s;uch a knowledge of the principles of civil policy, as qualified him for a conte&s;t, not with American planters, or colony agents, but with tumid orators, factious lawyers, and intere&s;ted &s;elfi&s;h merchants. And, in this exerci&s;e of his pen,
<PB N="501" REF="506">
he was not le&s;s &s;incere than formidable. Admitting him to be a tory, he was a friend to both the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical and civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of his country; and he thought it his duty, as a good &s;ubject, when the legi&s;|lative authority was denied, to refute the arguments of &s;uch as re&s;i&s;ted it.</P>
<P>It has been in&s;inuated, that in his vindication of the mea&s;ures of government, as contained in the &s;everal pamphlets before cited, John&s;on had an eye rather to the obligation which his pen&s;ion implied, than to the que&s;tions in debate. This, if it could be proved, might be an objection to his integrity, but &s;ets him but on a level with his opponents, who&s;e apparent and known motive to oppo&s;ition and clamour was the de&s;ire of popularity, as a means, whereby the ambi|tious among them hoped to attain power, and the indigent to acquire places or emoluments; and who will &s;ay, that an itch for vulgar applau&s;e is not as corrupt a motive to an action as any that can be im|puted to one in John&s;on's &s;ituation? But with matters of opinion, motives have nothing to do: arguments alone are the weapons of controver&s;y. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t pamphlet, <Q REND="inline">'The Fal&s;e Alarm,'</Q> the que&s;tion there agitated was, whether the expul&s;ion of a member of one of the hou&s;es of parliament, by a majority of votes, imported a de&s;ign on the liberties of the peo|ple; and impartial po&s;terity, which mu&s;t decide upon it, will look no farther than to the rea&s;oning of each party.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e who endeavour at this time to excite &s;u&s;|picions of this nature, it may be truly &s;aid, that they under&s;tand neither the con&s;titution, nor the politics of this country; nor do they know, that the former
<PB N="502" REF="507">
is now &s;o amended by the conce&s;&s;ions which, &s;ince the re&s;toration, have been made by the crown to the people, that le&s;s is to be feared from princes or their mini&s;ters, who are ever re&s;pon&s;ible for their conduct, than from artful and de&s;igning men, &s;timulated by ambition, or provoked by di&s;appointment, and fur|ni&s;hed with the fa&s;cinating powers of popular elo|quence.</P>
<P>I forbear to animadvert on the two next &s;ucceeding pamphlets, <Q REND="inline">'Falkland's i&s;lands,'</Q> and <Q REND="inline">'The Patriot;'</Q> but &s;hall ob&s;erve that the la&s;t of the four, <Q REND="inline">'Taxation no Tyranny,'</Q> has not only never received an an&s;wer, but the conver&s;e of the propo&s;ition has never yet been &s;o proved, by arguments founded on legal principles, as to make a vindication of John&s;on's rea&s;oning ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for any other purpo&s;e, than that of preventing the ignorant from being mi&s;led. The principle a&s;|&s;umed by John&s;on, that <Q REND="inline">'the &s;upreme power of every community has the right of requiring from all its &s;ubjects &s;uch contributions as are nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety, or public pro&s;perity,'</Q> is as &s;elf-evident, as that obedience is due from children to parents, and is not refuted by the a&s;&s;ertion, that the con&s;ent of tho&s;e who are required thus to contribute, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for, were it &s;o, what becomes of the right? Neither is the po&s;ition, that taxation and repre&s;entation are correlative, to be admitted as a principle of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, &s;eeing it does not, nor ever did, exi&s;t as a part of it; and that the far greater number of the &s;ubjects of England, men who are not free|holders to a certain amount, copyholders, who are a third of the landholders in this kingdom, and all women, are unrepre&s;ented in parliament, and bound by laws enacted by the repre&s;entatives of others, but
<PB N="503" REF="508">
in no &s;en&s;e of them&s;elves. In cities, and boroughs, the repre&s;entation is often of the meane&s;t of the people; in London, for in&s;tance, where a mechanic, if he be a liveryman, has a vote, and a freeholder, wanting that qualification, though a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed ever &s;o high to the land-tax, has none.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;ertion might po&s;&s;ibly have place in a &s;tate about to be founded, as none ever was or is likely to be, on &s;olemn agreement, or that political fiction called an original contract; but, the con&s;titution of a &s;tate already formed, is to be taken as we find it. Nor has any one of tho&s;e who deny the right of a mother|country to tax its colonies, attempted to prove an exemption, by any arguments than are to be found in Mr. Locke's E&s;&s;ay on Government, a di&s;|cour&s;e of general import, and which applies to no ex|i&s;ting con&s;titution on earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I once had a conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject with a nobleman, who afterwards attained to the height of power in the admini&s;tration, and was again&s;t the pro&s;ecution of the American war; the &s;ame who was once heard to utter this &s;tabbing truth, that the &s;un of Great Britain's glory was then &s;et; who went no farther than to doubt of the right above &s;poken of; and, for this doubt he had no better a rea&s;on to urge, than that Cromwell, in his levies on the Americans for the common &s;ervice, contented him&s;elf with a bare requi&s;ition of &s;uch &s;upplies as they, in their di&s;cretion, &s;hould judge proporti|onate to their circum&s;tances and abilities.

<P>The above tracts, as they contain no evidence of a per&s;onal attachment of the author to tho&s;e who, at the re&s;pective times of their appearance, had the direction of the public councils, are a refutation of all tho&s;e &s;landers which they drew on him; and, as

<P>I have hitherto forborne to &s;peak, otherwi&s;e than in general terms, of John&s;on's political principles; but, the ta&s;k of reviewing the tracts above cited, has revived in my memory many of his &s;entiments, which, at different times, he communicated to me, on the &s;ubjects of government, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and the motives to party oppo&s;ition. That he was a tory, he not only never he&s;itated to confe&s;s, but, by his frequent invectives again&s;t the whigs, was forward to proclaim: yet, was he not &s;o be&s;otted in his no|tions, as to abett what is called the patriarchal &s;cheme, as delineated by Sir Robert Filmer and other writers on government; nor, with others of a more &s;ober ca&s;t, to acquie&s;ce in the opinion that, becau&s;e &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to governors is, in general terms, inculcated in the Holy Scriptures, the re&s;i&s;tance of tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion is, in all ca&s;es, unlawful: he &s;eemed rather to adopt the &s;entiments of Hooker on the &s;ubject, as ex|plained by Hoadly, and, by con&s;equence, to look on &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to lawful authority as a moral obligation: he, therefore, condemned the conduct of James the &s;econd during his &s;hort reign; and, had he been a &s;ubject of that weak and infatuated monarch, would,

I am per&s;uaded, have re&s;i&s;ted any inva&s;ion of his right, or unwarrantable exertion of power, with the &s;ame &s;pirit, as did the pre&s;ident and fellows of Mag|dalen college, or tho&s;e con&s;cientious divines the &s;even bi&s;hops. This di&s;po&s;ition, as it leads to whiggi&s;m, one would have thought, might have reconciled him to the memory of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who&s;e exerci&s;e of the regal authority among us merited better returns than were made him; but, it had no &s;uch effect: he never &s;poke of king William but in terms of reproach, and, in his opinion of him, &s;eemed to adopt all the preju|dices of jacobite bigotry and rancour.</P>
<P>For the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, as originally framed, he ever expre&s;&s;ed a profound reverence. He under|&s;tood it well, and had noted in his mind the changes it had at various periods undergone, that is to &s;ay, fir&s;t, in the reign of Hen. VII. when the yeomanry were put into a &s;tate of competition with the nobility; afterwards, when by the abolition of tenures, and the putting down the court of wards and liveries, occa&s;ion was given to Sir Harbottle Grim&s;ton to &s;ay that, in that tran&s;action, neither did the crown know what it lo&s;t, nor the people what they had gained; and la&s;tly, by the erecting a monied, in oppo&s;ition to the landed, intere&s;t, and the introduction of the &s;cience and practice of funding.</P>
<P>He, therefore, looked not on Magna Charta as the palladium of our liberties, (knowing full well, that, excepting that chapter thereof, which has been &s;o often partially cited, that is to &s;ay, with the omi&s;&s;ion of the words, vel per legem terrae<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel impri&s;onetur, aut di&s;&s;ei&s;ietur de libero tenemento &s;uo, vel libertatibus, vel liberis con&s;uetudi|nibus &s;uis, aut utlegatur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo de&s;truatur, nee &s;uper eum ibimus, nec &s;uper eum mittemus, ni&s;i per legale judicium parium &s;uorum, vel per legem terrae.

<P>To party-oppo&s;ition he ever expre&s;&s;ed great aver|&s;ion; and, of the pretences of patriots, always &s;poke with indignation and contempt. He partook of the &s;hort-lived joy that infatuated the public, when Sir Robert Walpole cea&s;ed to have the direction of the national councils, and tru&s;ted to the profe&s;&s;ions of Mr. Pulteney and his adherents, who called them&s;elves the country-party, that all elections &s;hould thenceforward be free and uninfluenced, and that bribery and cor|ruption, which were never practi&s;ed but by courtiers and their agents, &s;hould be no more. A few weeks, nay, a few days, convinced John&s;on, and indeed all England, that what had a&s;&s;umed the appearance of patrioti&s;m, was per&s;onal hatred and inveterate malice in &s;ome, and in others, an ambition for that power, which, when they had got it, they knew not how to exerci&s;e. A change of men, and in &s;ome re&s;pect, of mea&s;ures, took place; Mr. Pulteney's ambition was gratified by a peerage; the wants of his a&s;&s;ociates were relieved by places, and &s;eats at the public boards; and, in a &s;hort time, the &s;tream of government re&s;umed its former channel, and ran with a current as even as it had ever done.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="512">
Upon this development of the motives, the views, and the con&s;i&s;tency of the above-mentioned band of patriots, John&s;on once remarked to me, that it had given more &s;trength to government than all that had been written in its defence, meaning thereby, that it had de&s;troyed all confidence in men of that character. Little did he then think, that the people of this country would again be deluded, by fallacious rea&s;oning and &s;pecious eloquence, into a fruitle&s;s expenditure of near one hundred millions, or that &s;tatues would ever be erected to eternize the memory of a mini&s;ter, of whom, in 1771, he &s;aid it would be happy if the nation &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s him to namele&s;s ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory has been &s;aid to be philo&s;ophy teaching by example, and well would it be for mankind, if they would convert events into precepts, and not po&s;tpone their care to prevent evils, till their own ex|perience &s;hall have brought them home to them&s;elves. New generations of men ari&s;e in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, who, in the nonage of their faculties, are credulous, weak, and open to deceit: the&s;e, unhackneyed in the ways of the world, tru&s;t to the profe&s;&s;ions of all who pretend a friend&s;hip for them; and, when they are told they are ill governed, are as ready, as were the I&s;raelites of old, to murmur again&s;t their rulers. And let all be &s;aid that can of a principle in men inve&s;ted with power, to abu&s;e it and become tyrants, the hi&s;tory of the world will inform us, that there is al&s;o a di&s;ea&s;e, which the Scriptures emphatically term, the madne&s;s of the people, from which evils greater than from de&s;poti&s;m are to be feared, and that government, even where it is be&s;t admini&s;tered, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts more by force than by the con&s;ent of tho&s;e who derive benefit from it.

What an advantage, then, does this di&s;po&s;ition in a people give to ambitious men, endowed with that kind of eloquence, which fa&s;cinates without conviction, and, while it delights, &s;tupifies!</P>
<P>His frequent reflections on the politics of this country, and the willingne&s;s of the people to be de|ceived, had begot in John&s;on &s;uch an apathy, as ren|dered him deaf to the calls of tho&s;e who were watching over our deare&s;t rights. When the cry was loude&s;t again&s;t general warrants, he took not the alarm; and, when they were declared illegal, he prote&s;ted to me, that he would, at no time of his life, have given half a crown to be for ever indemnified again&s;t their ope|ration. The que&s;tion of the legality of that kind of proce&s;s is now at an end, and I will not arraign the deci&s;ion that condemned it; but it will ever remain a que&s;tion, whether we have not lo&s;t more by it than we have gained; and, that the friends of liberty, par|ticularly the citizens of London, may be enabled to di&s;cu&s;s it, I will furni&s;h them with a few facts, that I believe they have never yet been aware of.</P>
<P>Few are &s;o ignorant as not to know, that the Engli&s;h manufactures excel tho&s;e of all other coun|tries; but many there are who need to be told, that the time may come, when they &s;hall cea&s;e to maintain that character. Many of the princes of Europe have become emulous of our greatne&s;s, and have long been labouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, in their dominions, &s;uch articles of trade, as &s;hould not only rival our's, but, in re&s;pect of cheapne&s;s, gain a preference at foreign markets. To this end, it has, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, been the practice of the emi&s;&s;aries of foreign courts, by their agents, and the temptation of large
<PB N="509" REF="514">
premiums, to engage artificers to leave this country, and, taking with them their wives and families, as al&s;o their engines, tools, and implements of their re&s;pec|tive trades, to &s;ettle abroad. Clothiers, weavers, frame-work-knitters, watch-makers, and men of va|rious other occupations, have been the people whom they have chiefly thus inveigled, and have, from time to time, in great numbers, in &s;hips provided and &s;tationed for the purpo&s;e, tran&s;ported out of the kingdom. To check this practice, acts of parliament have been made, which lay &s;uch emigrants under great di&s;abilities, even to the depriving them of the privileges of &s;ubjects, and others that inflict heavy penalties on tho&s;e that &s;educe them; and the aid of government has been frequently implored to re&s;train, in their flight from their native land, &s;hip-loads of the mo&s;t u&s;eful of all &s;ubjects. The method has uniformly been, upon information given at his office, for a &s;ecretary of &s;tate to i&s;&s;ue his warrant, a general one, that is to &s;ay, without any &s;pecification of names, to &s;top the &s;ailing of the ve&s;&s;el, which, perhaps, was lying at Wapping, Ratcliff, or Blackwall, ready with the tide to depart.

The licence, which this determination affords, has already begun to operate, and, perhaps, in no in&s;tance more than in the article of watches.

It is well known, that the late king of Spain was extremely fond of clocks and watches, and that he was u&s;ed, by letters in his own hand-writing, to corre&s;pond with Mr. Ellicot on the &s;ubject of his art; and, that this ingenious artificer

<P>In the cour&s;e of this narrative it has been &s;hewn, that although, and that by his own declarations, the literary faculties of John&s;on were, at mo&s;t times, inert, and that he could &s;eldom be &s;timulated to the exerci&s;e of his pen, but by the immediate pro&s;pect of gain; yet, he was ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the publication of any work that had either novelty or any intrin&s;ic worth, with a life of the author, a dedication, preface, or an introduction tending to recommend it, as in the ca&s;e of <Q REND="inline">'A&s;cham's Pieces,'</Q> the la&s;t edition of Sir Thomas Browne's <Q REND="inline">'Chri&s;tian Morals,'</Q> and Kennedy's <Q REND="inline">'Scripture Chronology,'</Q> and many more, all of which he u&s;hered into the world, and, for aught that appears, without any recompence. With a like benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, he was ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t with a prologue, or an epilogue, the repre&s;entation of a play written by a friend; or with an occa&s;ional addre&s;s of the &s;ame kind, under cir|cum&s;tances that put it in his power to promote the intere&s;ts of the family of a decea&s;ed author: accord|ingly, he wrote, for his friend Gold&s;mith, a prologue to a comedy written by him, called <Q REND="inline">'The Good|natured man,'</Q> and acted in 1769; and, for the grand|daughter of Milton, a prologue to Comus, exhibited on the fifth day of April, 1750.</P>

The &s;ame good office he performed for the wife and children of Mr. Hugh Kelly, the author of a comedy called, <Q REND="inline">'A Word to the Wi&s;e,'</Q> which, in the year 1770, was brought on the &s;tage, but, by the malice of a party, was ob&s;tructed in the repre&s;en|tation, and con&s;igned to oblivion. This per&s;on, it is &s;aid, was originally a &s;tay-maker, but, being a man of wit and parts, he quitted that unmanly occupation, and having, as we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome &s;lender means to enable him thereto, he betook him&s;elf to reading and &s;tudy, and, at a time when the di&s;cipline of the inns of court was &s;candalou&s;ly lax, got him&s;elf called to the bar, and practi&s;ed at the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;i|ons under me, but with little &s;ucce&s;s. In aid of this profe&s;&s;ion, he became the conductor of a paper called <Q REND="inline">'The Public Ledger,'</Q> and took up that precarious one of a writer for the &s;tage, in which he met with &s;ome encouragement, till it was in&s;inuated, that he was a pen&s;ioner of the mini&s;ter, and, therefore, a fit object of patriotic vengeance. He died in the year 1769, and leaving a wife and five children unprovided for, the proprietors of Covent-garden theatre, in 1777; with their u&s;ual genero&s;ity, permitted to be acted at their hou&s;e, for the benefit of his family, the comedy above-mentioned; and, to &s;often the hearts of the au|dience, John&s;on was ea&s;ily prevailed on to write upon the occa&s;ion the following very fine lines:<Q><L>This night pre&s;ents a play, which public rage,</L>
<L>Or right or wrong, once hooted from the &s;tage:</L>
<L>From zeal, or malice, now no more we dread,</L>
<L>For Engli&s;h vengeance <HI>wars not with the dead</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the a&s;&s;ertion contained in this line, I here note an ex|ception. Whoever has viewed the monument of Camden in the &s;outh tran&s;ept of We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey, mu&s;t, till very lately, have remarked, that his bu&s;t thereon was defaced, the no&s;e having been &s;tricken off. This was no recent accident, but a de&s;igned injury to his memory, done to it by an exa&s;perated young man who lived at the time of its erection. The fact is related by Dr. Thomas Smith, in his life of Camden, prefixed to his letters, 4to. 1691, and is to this effect. Camden, in his annals, &s;ub anno 1595, had related, that a young lady, who&s;e name he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but whom I conjecture to have been the daughter of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and one of queen Eliza|beth's maids of honour, had been &s;educed by the arts of a young man of high rank, to whom &s;he was afterwards married, and who became di&s;tingui&s;hed for his bravery and learning, Sir Walter Raleigh, as I &s;uppo&s;e. This fact, though notorious in the court, gave &s;uch offence to the young man above-mentioned, who was a relation of the lady, as induced him to revenge him&s;elf on the author's memory by mutilating his effigy. The injury done to it has, however, been lately repaired, and the feature re&s;tored, by the direction, and at the expence of a friend to the memory of Camden.</NOTE>.</L>

<P>In the year 1777, he was induced, by a ca&s;e of a very extraordinary nature, to the exerci&s;e of that in|di&s;criminate humanity, which, in him, was obedient to every call. A divine of the church of England, Dr. William Dodd, already mentioned in the cour&s;e of this account, and who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the education of the pre&s;ent earl of Che&s;terfield, having, by his extravagance, involved him&s;elf in difficulties, had re|cour&s;e to the following, among many other expe|dients, to rai&s;e money. As a pretended agent for this nobleman, and in con&s;ideration of the &s;um of 600l. he forged the hand of the earl to the grant of an annuity, chargeable on his e&s;tate, which for|gery being detected, Dodd was convicted of felony, and &s;entenced to the u&s;ual puni&s;hment for &s;uch of|fences. The public were, at fir&s;t, very little intere&s;ted in the fate of a man, who, be&s;ides the arts he had practi&s;ed to make him&s;elf con&s;picuous as a man of letters, had rendered him&s;elf &s;candalous, by an offer, to the fir&s;t law-officer in the kingdom, of a large &s;um of money, for a pre&s;entation to a valuable rectory; but, by various artifices, and particularly, the in&s;er|tion of his name in the public papers, with &s;uch palliatives as he and his friends could invent, never without the epithet of <HI>unfortunate,</HI> they were be|trayed into &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;tic commi&s;eration of his
<PB N="521" REF="526">
ca&s;e, as would have led a &s;tranger to believe, that him&s;elf had been no acce&s;&s;ary to his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but that they were the inflictions of Providence.</P>
<P>Great endeavours were u&s;ed with the earl, to pre|vail on him to de&s;i&s;t from a pro&s;ecution, but without effect. His lord&s;hip preferred a bill of indictment for felony, and the &s;ame being found before me at Hicks's Hall, upon the evidence of him&s;elf, and other witne&s;&s;es, Dodd was, at the Old Bailey, arraigned thereon, and convicted.</P>
<P>The evidence on the trial, was &s;o very full and clear, that the jury he&s;itated not in the lea&s;t to pro|nounce him guilty of the indictment; and, no cir|cum&s;tances of alleviation appearing, they did not, as juries &s;eldom fail to do where that is the ca&s;e, re|commend him as an object of that clemency, which his maje&s;ty is ever ready to exert, in favour of tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t claim to it.</P>
<P>We live in an age in which humanity is the fa&s;hion. If the reports of the gaol-committee in 1726 are, in all particulars, to be depended on, and do not exagge|rate the facts therein &s;tated, there was a time when, as well pri&s;oners for debt, as for offences, were cruelly treated by tho&s;e who had the cu&s;tody of them; but, at this day, the temper of the times is under a con|trary bia&s;s, for, not only in actual confinement, are pri&s;oners treated with greater lenity than till of late years was ever known, but, in courts of ju&s;tice, the regard &s;hewn to offenders falls little &s;hort of re&s;pect. In pro&s;ecutions at the &s;uit of the crown, the indul|gence of pri&s;oners is nearly as great as it ought to be, were that true which the law does but hardly pre&s;ume, viz. that every offender, who is brought to a legal trial,
<PB N="522" REF="527">
is innocent, till his guilt be proved. Tho&s;e who&s;e duty it is to conduct the evidence, fearing the cen&s;ure that others have incurred by a contrary treatment of pri&s;oners, are re&s;trained from enforcing it; and, as it is an exerci&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion that co&s;ts nothing, and is &s;ure to gain the applau&s;e of vulgar hearers, every one intere&s;ts him&s;elf on the &s;ide of the pri&s;oner, and hopes, by his zeal in his behalf, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed as a man of more than ordinary humanity.</P>
<P>The tenderne&s;s of our courts of ju&s;tice, in pro&s;e|cutions that affect the life or liberty of the offender, is acknowledged and celebrated by all writers on the &s;ubjects of juri&s;prudence and internal policy; but, be|&s;ide this, the chances of eluding conviction, or, if not that, of puni&s;hment, are &s;o many, that they deter many injured per&s;ons from the pro&s;ecution of great criminals; and, as it is a &s;peculation that has often employed my thoughts, I will endeavour at an enume|ration of them. The chances are the&s;e: 1 That the offender is not di&s;covered, or, if di&s;covered, not apprehended. 2 That the per&s;on injured is not both able and willing to pro&s;ecute him. 3 That the evidence is not &s;ufficient for the finding of the bill, or if it be, 4 That the indictment is &s;o framed as that the offender cannot be convicted on it; or, 5 That the witne&s;&s;es to &s;upport it may die, or be prevailed upon to ab&s;cond, or to &s;often their te&s;timony; or, 6 They may be entangled or made to contradict them&s;elves, or each other, in a cro&s;s exa|mination, by the pri&s;oner's council; or, 7 A mild judge; or, 8 An ignorant or perver&s;e jury: 9 A re|commendation to mercy; or, 10 Appeals to the public by &s;tates of his ca&s;e in pamphlets, or news-paper pa|ragraphs,

which the Newgate &s;olicitors know very well how to get drawn. 11 Practices with a jury to ob|tain a declaration, that &s;ome of them were di&s;&s;atisfied with the verdict. 12 A motion in arre&s;t of judgment. 13 A writ of error grounded on &s;ome defect or mi&s;|take on the face of the record. 14 An e&s;cape; and la&s;tly, Intere&s;t to procure a pardon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To this purpo&s;e, and as a caveat again&s;t &s;eeking redre&s;s for injuries by going to law, I recollect a &s;aying of a very &s;agacious and experienced citizen, Mr. Selwin, who formerly was a can|didate for the office of chamberlain, and mi&s;&s;ed it only by &s;even votes out of near &s;even thou&s;and.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'A man,' &s;ays he, 'who deli|berates about going to law, &s;hould have, fir&s;t, a good cau&s;e; &s;econdly, a good pur&s;e; thirdly, an hone&s;t and &s;kilful attorney; fourthly, good evidence; fifthly, able council; &s;ixthly, an up|right judge; &s;eventhly, an intelligent jury; and, with all the&s;e on his &s;ide, if he has not, eighthly, good luck, it is odds but he mi&s;carries in his &s;uit.'</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame per&s;on told me the following &s;tory: He was once re|que&s;ted, by a man under &s;entence of death in Newgate, to come and &s;ee him in his cell, and, in pure humanity, he made him a vi&s;it. The man briefly informed him, that he had been tried and convicted of felony, and was in daily expectation of the arrival of the warrant for his execution; <Q REND="inline">'but,' &s;aid he, 'I have 200l. and you are a man of character, and had the court-intere&s;t when you &s;tood for chamberlain: I &s;hould therefore hope, it is in your power to get me off.'&mdash;</Q>Mr. Selwin was &s;truck with &s;o &s;trange an applica|tion, and, to account for it, a&s;ked, if there were any alleviating cir|cum&s;tances in his ca&s;e: the man peevi&s;hly an&s;wered&mdash;No,&mdash;but that he had enquired into the hi&s;tory of the place where he was, and could not find, that any one who had two hundred pounds, was ever hanged.&mdash;Mr. Selwin told him, it was out of his power to help him, and bade him farewell,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'which,' added he, 'he did; for he found means to e&s;cape puni&s;hment.'</Q></P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of the law, and of magi&s;trates, to be merciful to offenders again&s;t it, leads me to remark, that in the people of this country there is a general propen&s;ity to humanity; and that, notwith&s;tanding the cry again&s;t mercile&s;s creditors, urged in favour of in&s;olvent acts, &s;uch a character is hardly now to be found. I have, in my time, di&s;charged great num|bers of debtors under &s;uch acts, and cannot recollect five in|&s;tances where their di&s;charge has been oppo&s;ed. And, with re|gard to bankrupts and other in&s;olvents, I am warranted by long experience and much ob&s;ervation to &s;ay, that in ca&s;es where their inability to pay their debts has ari&s;en from misfortune, the readine&s;s of creditors to accept a &s;mall compo&s;ition, and give them fre&s;h credit, has been &s;uch as I could not contem|plate without calling to remembrance the parable in the Go&s;pel of the lord that was moved with compa&s;&s;ion, and forgave his debtor. And, with re&s;pect to injuries, &s;uch as per&s;onal a&s;&s;aults or indignities, an Engli&s;hman never &s;eeks farther than to humble his adver&s;ary: when that is done, forgivene&s;s and &s;haking hands follow of cour&s;e. If, therefore, it be true, that humanity is the offspring of courage, we have not far to &s;eek for the &s;ource of Briti&s;h bravery.</P></NOTE>.</P>

To the fir&s;t of the&s;e petitions, but not without diffi|culty, Mrs. Dodd fir&s;t got the hands of the jury that found the bill again&s;t her hu&s;band, and after that, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, of the jury that tried him. It was then circulated about, and all the while the cry for mercy was kept up in the news-papers, and the merits and &s;ufferings of the unfortunate divine were &s;o artfully repre&s;ented by paragraphs therein in&s;erted, that, in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, no fewer than twenty-three thou|&s;and names were &s;ub&s;cribed thereto. Moreover, letters and addre&s;&s;es, written al&s;o by John&s;on, imploring their interpo&s;ition, were &s;ent to the mini&s;ter and other great per&s;ons.</P>
<P>While the two petitions were in &s;u&s;pence, the fol|lowing ob&s;ervations, penned by Dr. John&s;on, appeared in the public papers:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>'Ye&s;terday was pre&s;ented to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, by earl Percy, a petition in favour of Dr. Dodd, &s;igned by twenty-three thou&s;and hands. On this occa&s;ion it is natural to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>'That, in all countries, penal laws have been re|laxed, as particular rea&s;ons have emerged.</P>
<P>'That a life eminently beneficent, a &s;ingle action eminently good, or even the power of being u&s;eful to the public, have been &s;ufficient to protect the life of a delinquent.</P>
<P>'That no arbiter of life and death has ever been cen&s;ured for granting the life of a criminal to hone&s;t and powerful &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>'That the man for whom a nation petitions, mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to have merit uncommon, in kind or in degree; for, however the mode of collecting
<PB N="528" REF="533">
&s;ub&s;criptions, or the right of judgment exerci&s;ed by the &s;ub&s;cribers, may be open to di&s;pute, it is, at lea&s;t, plain, that &s;omething is done for this man that was never done for any other; and govern|ment, which mu&s;t proceed upon general views, may rationally conclude, that this man is &s;omething better than other offenders have been, or has done &s;omething more than others have done.</P>
<P>'That though the people cannot judge of the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice &s;o well as their governors, yet their voice has always been regarded.</P>
<P>'That this is a ca&s;e in which the petitioners de|termine again&s;t their own intere&s;t; tho&s;e for who&s;e protection the law was made, intreat its relaxation, and our governors cannot be charged with the con&s;equences which the people bring upon them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>'That as this is a ca&s;e without example, it will probably be without con&s;equences, and many ages will elap&s;e before &s;uch a crime is again committed by &s;uch a man.</P>
<P>'That though life be &s;pared, ju&s;tice may be &s;a|tisfied with ruin, impri&s;onment, exile, infamy, and penury.</P>
<P>'That if the people now commit an error, their error is on the part of mercy: and that perhaps hi&s;tory cannot &s;hew a time, in which the life of a criminal, guilty of nothing above fraud, was re|fu&s;ed to the cry of nations, to the joint &s;upplica|tion of three and twenty thou&s;and petitioners.'</P></Q></P>
<P>While Dodd was waiting the event of the petitions, his wife and friends were not idle. Dr. John&s;on told
<PB N="529" REF="534">
me, that they had offered Akerman, the keeper of Newgate, a thou&s;and pounds to let him e&s;cape; and that failing, that a number of them, with bank|notes in their pockets, to the amount of five hun|dred pounds, had watched for a whole evening, about the door of the pri&s;on, for an opportunity of corrupting the turnkey; but could not &s;ucceed in the attempt.</P>
<P>When all hopes of a favourable an&s;wer to either of the petitions were at an end, John&s;on drew up for publication a &s;mall collection of what are called<Q REND="inline">'Occa&s;ional papers by the late William Dodd, L.L.D.'</Q> and five hundred copies thereof were printed for the benefit of his wife; but &s;he, con|&s;cious that they were not of her hu&s;band's writing, would not con&s;ent to their being publi&s;hed; and the whole number, except two or three copies, was &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. The la&s;t office he performed for this wretched man, was the compo&s;ing a &s;ermon, which he delivered in the chapel of Newgate, on Friday 6th June, 1777, and which was &s;oon after publi&s;hed with the title of <Q REND="inline">'The Convict's Addre&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P>John&s;on had never &s;een the face of Dodd in his life. His wife had found her way to him during his confinement, and had intere&s;ted him &s;o &s;trongly in his behalf, that he lamented his fate, as he would have done that of an intimate friend under the like circum&s;tances. He was deeply concerned at the failure of the petitions; and a&s;ked me at the time, if the reque&s;t contained in them was not &s;uch an one as ought to have been granted to the prayer of twen|ty-three thou&s;and &s;ubjects? to which I an&s;wered, that the &s;ub&s;cription of popular petitions was a thing of
<PB N="530" REF="535">
cour&s;e, and that, therefore, the difference between twenty and twenty thou&s;and names was incon&s;iderable. He further cen&s;ured the clergy very &s;everely, for not interpo&s;ing in his behalf, and &s;aid, that their inactivity aro&s;e from a paltry fear of being reproached with partiality towards one of their own order.</P>
<P>Here I cannot forbear remarking, an incon&s;i&s;tency in the opinion of John&s;on re&s;pecting the ca&s;e of Dodd. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;olicitations for his pardon, yet, in his private judgment, he thought him unworthy of it, having been known to &s;ay, that had he been the ad|vi&s;er of the king, he &s;hould have told him that, in par|doning Dodd, his ju&s;tice, in remitting the Perreaus to their &s;entence, would have been called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>About this time, Dr. John&s;on changed his dwelling in John&s;on's court, for a &s;omewhat larger in Bolt court, Fleet &s;treet, where he commenced an intimacy with the landlord of it, a very worthy and &s;en&s;ible man, &s;ome time &s;ince decea&s;ed, Mr. Edmund Allen the printer. Behind it was a garden, which he took delight in watering; a room on the ground-floor was a&s;&s;igned to Mrs. Williams, and the whole of the two pair of &s;tairs floor was made a repo&s;itory for his books; one of the rooms thereon being his &s;tudy. Here, in the intervals of his re&s;idence at Streatham, he received the vi&s;its of his friends, and, to the mo&s;t intimate of them, &s;ometimes gave, not inelegant dinners.</P>
<P>Being at ea&s;e in his circum&s;tances, and free from that &s;olicitude which had embittered the former part of his life, he &s;unk into indolence, till his faculties feemed to be impaired: deafne&s;s grew upon him; long intervals of mental ab&s;ence interrupted his con|ver&s;ation,
<PB N="531" REF="536">
and it was difficult to engage his attention to any &s;ubject. His friends, from the&s;e &s;ymptoms, concluded, that his lamp was emitting its la&s;t rays, but the lap&s;e of a &s;hort period gave them ample proofs to the contrary.</P>
<P>In the year 1774, the long-agitated que&s;tion of li|terary property received a final deci&s;ion, on an appeal to the &s;upreme judicature of this kingdom, whereby it was, in effect, declared, that &s;uch property was merely ideal, and exi&s;ted only in imagination<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the arguments in this ca&s;e, on a &s;pecial verdict, in the court of King's-bench, it was admitted, that precedents, directly to the point, were wanting: it was, therefore, determined by lord Man&s;|field and two other judges, Yates alone di&s;&s;enting, upon the &s;imple principles of natural ju&s;tice and moral fitne&s;s, that the right con|tended for did exi&s;t; and that the&s;e are part of the law of England is a&s;&s;erted, and has ever been under&s;tood. Vide Dodderidge's <Q REND="inline">'Eng|li&s;h Lawyer,'</Q> page 154 to 161, and <Q REND="inline">'Doctor and Student'</Q> pa&s;&s;im. Neverthele&s;s, in the argument of an appeal to the lords from a decree of the court of Chancery in 1774, it was contended, that, in new ca&s;es, the judges had no right to decide by the rules of moral fitne&s;s and equitable right, but were to be ruled by precedents alone. An objection the more remarkable, as coming from men who are known to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;tudy of antiquity, to have ridiculed the peru&s;al of records, and to have treated with the utmo&s;t &s;corn, what they are plea&s;ed to term, black-letter learning. If this be law, and every judicial determination needs a precedent, we are left at a lo&s;s to account for tho&s;e carly and original determinations for which no precedent could be found, but which are now become fundamental principles of law: &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as that a bare right of action is not a&s;&s;ignable; that, of things fixed to the freehold, felony cannot be committed; that a relea&s;e to one tre&s;pa&s;&s;er is a relea&s;e to all; and numberle&s;s others. Lord Hardwicke has been known to direct a &s;earch for precedents, and, when none could be found, to &s;ay&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I will make one.'</Q></P></NOTE>. The immediate con&s;equence of this determination
<PB N="532" REF="537">
was, a &s;cramble of the lowe&s;t and lea&s;t principled of the book&s;ellers, for the jewel thus ca&s;t among them. Regardle&s;s of that obvious rule of natural ju&s;tice, which gives the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a right to what he has purcha&s;ed, they printed books, for the copy-right whereof very large &s;ums had been paid by book|&s;ellers, who, for their liberality to authors, and the encouragement by them given to voluminous works, had been looked on and acknowledged as the patrons of literature. Among the&s;e numerous depredators was one, who projected an edition of the Engli&s;h poets, which, by adverti&s;ements conceived in the mo&s;t hyperbolical terms, and calculated to impo&s;e upon the credulity of the ignorant, was obtruded on the public.</P>
<P>The book&s;ellers, again&s;t who&s;e intere&s;t this intended publication was likely to operate, derived their right to the works of many of the poets, included in the above de&s;ign by me&s;ne a&s;&s;ignments, from tho&s;e ever re&s;pectable men the Ton&s;ons, who had purcha&s;ed them of their authors. To check this attempt, therefore, they determined them&s;elves to publi&s;h an edition of the poets, and, in order to obtain for it a preference, engaged John&s;on to write the lives of all, or the chief of them; and he undertook and exe|cuted the ta&s;k with great alacrity, and in a manner that argued not the lea&s;t decline of his faculties.</P>
<P>When John&s;on had determined on this work, he was to &s;eek for the be&s;t mode of executing it. On a hint from a literary lady of his acquaintance and mine, he adopted, for his outline, that form in which the counte&s;s D'Aunois has drawn up the memoirs of the
<PB N="533" REF="538">
French poets, in her <Q REND="inline">'Recueils des plus belles pieces des Po&euml;tes Fran&ccedil;ois;'</Q> and the foundation of his work was, the lives of the dramatic poets by Lang|baine, and the lives of the poets at large by Win|&s;tanley, and that more modern one than either, their lives by Giles Jacob, who&s;e information, in many in&s;tances, was communicated by the per&s;ons them|&s;elves. Neverthele&s;s, the materials which John&s;on had to work on were very &s;canty. He was never a &s;edulous enquirer after facts or anecdotes, nor very accurate in fixing dates: Oldys was the man of all others the be&s;t qualified for &s;uch an employment; John&s;on's talent was di&s;qui&s;ition; a genius like his, di&s;dained &s;o &s;ervile a labour. Whenever, therefore, he found him&s;elf at a lo&s;s for &s;uch intelligence as his work required, he availed him&s;elf of the indu&s;try of a friend or two, who took plea&s;ure in furni&s;hing him with &s;uch particulars as are to be found in the lives of Addi&s;on, Prior, Pope, Swift, Gay, and a few others, who&s;e per&s;ons, habits, and characters, &s;ome yet, or very lately living, were able, either from their own knowledge, or authenticated tradition, to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The book came abroad in the year 1778, in ten &s;mall volumes, and no work of John&s;on has been more celebrated. It has been &s;aid to contain the &s;ounde&s;t principles of critici&s;m, and the mo&s;t judi|cious examen of the effu&s;ions of poetic genius, that any country, not excepting France, has to &s;hew; and &s;o much of this is true, that, in our peru&s;al of it, we find our curio&s;ity, as to facts and circum&s;tances, ab|&s;orbed in the contemplation of tho&s;e penetrating reflections and nice di&s;criminations, which are far the greater part of it.</P>
<P><PB N="534" REF="539">
It is, neverthele&s;s, to be que&s;tioned, whether John|&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the qualities of a critic, one of which &s;eems to be a truly poetic faculty. This may &s;eem a &s;trange doubt, of one who has transfu&s;ed the &s;pirit of one of Mr. Pope's fine&s;t poems into one written by him&s;elf in a dead language, and, in two in&s;tances, nearly equalled the greate&s;t of the Roman &s;atyri&s;ts. By the poetic faculty, I mean that power which is the re&s;ult of a mind &s;tored with beautiful images, and which exerts it&s;elf in creation and de&s;cription: of this John&s;on was totally devoid. His organs, im|perfect as they were, could convey to his imagination but little of that intelligence which forms the poetic character, and produces that enthu&s;ia&s;m which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it. If we try his ability by Shake&s;peare's fa|mous de&s;cription;
<Q><L>The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,</L>
<L>Doth glance from Heaven to earth, from earth to Heaven;</L>

<L>Turns them to &s;hapes, and gives to airy nothing</L>
<L>A local habitation, and a name:</L></Q>
he will appear deficient. We know that he wanted this power; that he had no eye that could be &s;aid to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oll or glance, and, therefore, that all his conceptions of the grandeur and magnificence of external objects, of beautiful &s;cenes, and exten&s;ive pro&s;pects, were derived from the reports of others, and con&s;equently were but the feeble impre&s;&s;ions of their archetypes;
<PB N="535" REF="540">
&s;o that it may be que&s;tioned whether, either waking or &s;leeping,
<Q><L>Such &s;ights as youthful poets dream,</L></Q>
were ever pre&s;ented to his view.</P>
<P>This defect in his imaginative faculty, may well account for the frigid commendation which John&s;on be&s;tows on Thom&s;on, and other of the de&s;criptive poets, on many fine pa&s;&s;ages in Dryden, and on the Henry and Emma of Prior. Moral &s;entiments, and ver&s;ification, &s;eem chiefly to have engaged his atten|tion, and on the&s;e his critici&s;ms are accurate, but &s;evere, and not always impartial. His avowed fond|ne&s;s for rhyme is one of the blemi&s;hes in his judg|ment: he entertained it in oppo&s;ition to Milton, and cheri&s;hed it through the whole of his life; and it led him into many errors. Dryden had his doubts about the preference of rhyme to blank ver&s;e; and I have heard John&s;on accu&s;e him for want of principle in this re&s;pect, and of veering about in his opinion on the &s;ubject. No &s;uch imputation could fa&s;ten on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>That John&s;on had no &s;en&s;e of the harmony of mu|&s;ical &s;ounds, him&s;elf would frequently confe&s;s, but this defect le&s;t him not without the power of deriving plea&s;ure from metrical harmony, from that commix|ture of long and &s;hort quantities, which the laws of pro&s;ody have reduced to rule, and from whence ari&s;es a delight in tho&s;e who&s;e ear is unaffected by con&s;onance. The &s;trokes on the pul&s;atile in&s;truments, the drum for in&s;tance, though they produce monoto|nous &s;ounds, have, if made by rule, mathematical ra|tios of duple and triple, with numberle&s;s fractions,
<PB N="536" REF="541">
and admit of an infinite variety of combinations, which give plea&s;ure to the auditory faculty; but of this John&s;on &s;eems al&s;o to have been in&s;en&s;ible. That his own numbers are &s;o harmonious as, in general, we find them, mu&s;t have been the effect of his &s;edu|lous attention to the writings of Dryden and Pope, and the di&s;covery of &s;ome &s;ecret in their ver&s;ification, of which he was able to avail him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If John&s;on be to be numbered among tho&s;e poets in whom the powers of under&s;tanding, more than tho&s;e of the imagination, are &s;een to exi&s;t, we have a rea&s;on for that coldne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility which he &s;o often di&s;covers in the cour&s;e of this work; and, when we recollect that he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be a fa&s;ti|dious critic, we are not to wonder, that he is &s;ome|times backward in be&s;towing applau&s;e on pa&s;&s;ages that &s;eem to merit it. In &s;hort, he was a &s;crupulous e&s;timator of beauties and blemi&s;hes, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;pirit of critici&s;m, which, by long exerci&s;e, may be &s;aid to have become mechanical. So nicely has he balanced the one again&s;t the other, that, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, he has made neither &s;cale preponderate, and, in others, by con&s;idering the failings of his authors as po&s;itive demerit, he has left &s;ome celebrated names in a &s;tate of reputation below mediocrity. A &s;pirit like this, had before actuated him in his preface to Shake&s;peare, in which, by a kind of arithmetical proce&s;s, &s;ubtracting from his excellencies his failings, he has endeavoured to &s;ink him in the opinion of his numerous admirers, and to per&s;uade us, again&s;t rea&s;on and our own feelings, that the former are an|nihilated by the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="537" REF="542">
His cen&s;ures of the writings of lord Lyttelton, and of Gray, gave great offence to the friends of each: the fir&s;t co&s;t him the friend&s;hip of a lady, who&s;e re|marks on the genius of Shake&s;peare have rai&s;ed her to a degree of eminence among the female writers of this time; and the &s;uppo&s;ed injury done by him to the memory of Gray, is re&s;ented by the whole uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge. The character of Swift he has &s;tigmatized with the brand of pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed, that the marks thereof &s;eem inde|lible. In the prai&s;es of his wit, he does him no more than ju&s;tice; of his moral qualities, he has made the mo&s;t; and of his learning, of which Swift po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a very &s;mall portion, he has &s;aid nothing. Few can be offended at John&s;on's account of this man, who&s;e arrogance and malevolence were a reproach to human nature; and in who&s;e voluminous writings little is to be found, that can conduce to the improve|ment or benefit of mankind, or, indeed, that it be|&s;eemed a clergyman to publi&s;h.</P>
<P>In his own judgment of the lives of the poets, John&s;on gave the preference to that of Cowley, as containing a nicer inve&s;tigation and di&s;crimination of the characteri&s;tics of wit, than is el&s;ewhere to be found. Others have a&s;&s;igned to Dryden's life the pre-eminence. Upon the whole, it is a finely written, and an enter|taining book, and is likely to be coeval with the memory of the be&s;t of the writers whom it cele|brates.</P>
<P>To the life of Pope, he thought proper to adjoin a critici&s;m on the epitaphs of that poet, written &s;ome years before, and in&s;erted in a monthly pamphlet, intitled <Q REND="inline">'The Vi&s;itor,'</Q> in which he detects a great
<PB N="538" REF="543">
number of faulty pa&s;&s;ages, and puerile &s;entiments. An attempt of the like kind had formerly been made by Concanen, one of the Dunciad heroes, in a paper called <Q REND="inline">'The Speculati&s;t,'</Q> fir&s;t publi&s;hed in one of the periodical papers of the day, and afterwards collected into an octavo volume; but it went no farther than to a cen&s;ure of the in&s;cription on Craggs's monument in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey, which, by the way, was never in|tended for an epitaph, but is an eulogium on that &s;tate&s;|man, taken from Pope's <Q REND="inline">'Epi&s;tle to Mr. Addi&s;on, oc|ca&s;ioned by his dialogues on medals.'</Q> John&s;on has no|ticed this, and apologizing for &s;ome faults in it, imputes them, in his &s;trong manner of expre&s;&s;ion, to the violence with which the lines were torn from the original. The whole of Concanen's critici&s;m turns upon the length of the in&s;cription, which is &s;ix lines, and, by a &s;trange blunder of Pope, is recommended as a motto for the &s;uppo&s;ed medal to be &s;truck in commemoration of his &s;ervices, and gives occa&s;ion to the critic to a&s;k&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Is this a motto for a medal or a mill|&s;tone.'</Q></P>
<P>But John&s;on, who never examined the writings of any author, but with an eye the mo&s;t penetrating, has taken a nearer view of the&s;e compo&s;itions of Pope, as they appear in his works, and di&s;covered, that &s;carce any one of them, notwith&s;tanding the beauty of ver|&s;ification which they di&s;play, will bear the te&s;t of &s;ound critici&s;m. For his remarks on them, this is no fit place: the inqui&s;itive reader is therefore referred for the peru&s;al of them to the life of Pope, among the poets; and, for farther information on the &s;ubject of monumental in&s;criptions, to <Q REND="inline">'An E&s;&s;ay on Epitaphs,'</Q> among his philological tracts.</P>
<P><PB N="539" REF="544">
All that is nece&s;&s;ary to remark on his examen of Pope's epitaphs is, that, in one in&s;tance, it was pro|ductive of a &s;ingular event, the total era&s;ure of that epitaph on Sir Godfrey Kneller's monument in We&s;t|min&s;ter abbey, which had long been objected to, as being a very indifferent imitation of cardinal Bembo's famous di&s;tich on Raphael; and it &s;eems that the author thought &s;o, for, in the later editions of his works, he has omitted it.<Q><L>Ille hic e&s;t Rapha&euml;l, timuit quo &s;o&s;pite vinci</L>
<L>Rerum magna parens, &amp; moriente mori.</L></Q></P>
<P>After he had fini&s;hed the lives of the poets, John&s;on, contemplating the &s;trength of his mental powers, was &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of any decay in them, that he enter|tained a de&s;ign of giving to the world a tran&s;lation of that voluminous work of Thuanus, the hi&s;tory of his own times, an undertaking &s;urely too laborious for one who had nearly completed the age of man, and who&s;e mind was generally occupied by &s;ubjects of greater importance than any that relate to this world. But, in this e&s;timate of his abilities, he &s;oon found him&s;elf deceived. Sleeple&s;s nights, and the u&s;e of opium, which he took in large quantities, alternately depre&s;&s;ed and rai&s;ed his &s;pirits, and ren|dered him an incompetent judge of his own powers, &s;o that, had he pur&s;ued his re&s;olution, he would, doubt|le&s;s, have &s;unk under the burden of &s;o great a la|bour.</P>
<P>It may farther be que&s;tioned whether, upon trial, he would not have found him&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of transfu&s;ing into an Engli&s;h ver&s;ion the &s;pirit
<PB N="540" REF="545">
of his author. John&s;on's talent was original thinking, and though he was ever able to expre&s;s his own &s;en|timents in nervous language, he did not always &s;uc|ceed in his attempts to familiari&s;e the &s;en&s;e of others: his tran&s;lation of Pere Lobo's voyage has little to recommend it but the &s;ubject-matter. Among his papers was found, a tran&s;lation from Sallu&s;t of the <Q REND="inline">'Bellum Catilinarium,'</Q> &s;o flatly and in&s;ipidly rendered, that the &s;uffering it to appear would have been an in|deligible di&s;grace to his memory.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now take our leave of John&s;on as an au|thor, and view him as a man worn out with literary labour and di&s;ea&s;e, contemplating his di&s;&s;olution, and exerting all his powers to re&s;i&s;t that con&s;titutional malady which now, more than ever, oppre&s;&s;ed him. To divert him&s;elf from a train of thinking which often involved him in a labyrinth of doubts and difficulties touching a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, he &s;olicited the frequent vi&s;its of his friends and ac|quaintance, the mo&s;t di&s;cerning of whom could not but &s;ee, that the fabric of his mind was tottering; and, to allay tho&s;e &s;cruples and terrors which haunted him in his vacant hours, he betook him&s;elf to the reading of books of practical divinity, and, among the re&s;t, the writings of Baxter, and others of the old puritan and non-conforming divines. Of Baxter, he entertained a very high opinion, and often &s;poke of him to me as a man of great parts, profound learn|ing, and exemplary piety: he &s;aid, of the office for the communion drawn up by him and produced at the Savoy-conference, that it was one of the fine&s;t compo&s;itions of the ritual kind he had ever &s;een<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is printed at the end of the fir&s;t volume of Dr. Calamy's abridgement of Mr. Baxter's Hi&s;tory of his Life and Times.</NOTE>.

It was a circum&s;tance to be wondered at, that a high|churchman, as John&s;on ever profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be, &s;hould be driven to &s;eek for &s;piritual comfort in the writings of &s;ectaries; men whom he affected, as well to condemn for their ignorance, as to hate for their principles; but, as his acquaintance with the world, and with the writings of &s;uch men as Watts, Fo&s;ter, Lardner, and Lowman, increa&s;ed, the&s;e prejudices were greatly &s;oftened. Of the early puritans, he thought their want of general learning was atoned for by their &s;kill in the Scriptures, and the holine&s;s of their lives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Yet have there been among them a few, as eminent for their learning as their piety, and, in ju&s;tice to their memory, I will men|tion two of this character: the one was Gataker, well known for his excellent edition of the Meditations of the emperor Marcus Antoninus, and his Commentary on the prophecy of Jeremiah; the other, a &s;omewhat earlier writer, old Mr. Dod, &s;urnamed the De|calogi&s;t, an exqui&s;ite Hebrew &s;cholar, a man of primitive &s;anctity, and a pa&s;&s;ive non-conforming divine.

He was, for &s;ome time, plea&s;ed with Kempis's, or rather John Ger&s;on's tract <Q REND="inline">'De Imi|tatione Chri&s;ti,'</Q> but at length laid it a&s;ide, &s;ay|ing, that the main de&s;ign of it was to promote mo|na&s;tic piety, and inculcate eccle&s;ia&s;tical obedience. One &s;entiment therein, he, however, greatly ap|plauded, and I find it adopted by bi&s;hop Taylor, who gives it in the following words:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'It is no great matter to live lovingly with good-natured, with humble and meek per&s;ons; but he that can do &s;o with the froward, with the wilful, and the ignorant, with the peevi&s;h and perver&s;e, he only hath true charity.

<P>In the cour&s;e of the&s;e &s;tudies, he exerci&s;ed his powers of eloquence, in the compo&s;ition of forms of devotion, adapted to his circum&s;tances and the &s;tate of his mind at different times. Of the&s;e, a &s;pecimen has lately been given to the public. He al&s;o tran&s;lated into Latin many of the collects in our liturgy. This was a practice which he took up in his early years, and continued through his life, as he did al&s;o the noting down the particular occurrences of each day thereof, but in a loo&s;e and de&s;ultory way,

in books of various forms, and in no regular or con|tinued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce in that famous &s;aying of John Valde&s;&s;o, which induced the emperor Charles the fifth to re&s;ign his crown, and betake him&s;elf to religious retirement; <Q REND="inline">'Oportet inter vitae negotia, et diem mortis, &s;patium aliquod intercedere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is fit, that between the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and the day of death, &s;ome &s;pace &s;hould intervene.</NOTE>,'</Q> never|thele&s;s, he was but an ill hu&s;band of his time. He was, throughout his life, making re&s;olutions to ri&s;e at eight, no very early hour, and breaking them. The vi&s;its of idle, and &s;ome of them very worthle&s;s per&s;ons, were never unwelcome to him; and though they interrupted him in his &s;tudies and meditations, yet, as they gave him opportunities of di&s;cour&s;e, and furni&s;hed him with intelligence, he &s;trove rather to protract that &s;horten or di&s;countenance them; and, when abroad, &s;uch was the laxity of his mind, that he con&s;ented to the doing of many things, otherwi&s;e indifferent, for the avowed rea&s;on that they would drive on time.</P>
<P>Of his vi&s;itors at this time my&s;elf was one, and having known the &s;tate of his mind at different periods, and his habitual dread of in&s;anity, I was greatly de&s;irous of calming his mind, and rendering him &s;u&s;ceptible of the many enjoyments of which I thought him then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, namely, a permanent income, tolerable health, a high degree of reputation for his moral qualities and literary exertions, by which latter he had made a whole country &s;en&s;ible of its obligation to him, and, la&s;tly, that he had as
<PB N="545" REF="550">
few enemies as a man of his eminence could expect. On one day in particular, when I was &s;ugge&s;ting to him the&s;e and the like reflections, he gave thanks to Almighty God, but added, that notwith&s;tanding all the above benefits, the pro&s;pect of death, which was now at no great di&s;tance from him, was become ter|rible, and that he could not think of it but with great pain and trouble of mind.</P>
<P>I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;hocked at &s;uch a declaration from &s;uch a man, and told him, that from my long acquaintance with him, I conceived his life to have been an uniform cour&s;e of virtue, that he had ever &s;hewn a deep &s;en&s;e of, and zeal for, religion, and that, both by his example and his writings, he had recommended the practice of it: that he had not re&s;ted, as many do, in the exerci&s;e of common ho|ne&s;ty, avoiding the gro&s;&s;er enormities, yet rejecting tho&s;e advantages that re&s;ult from the belief of divine revelation, but that he had, by prayer, and other ex|erci&s;es of devotion, cultivated in his mind the &s;eeds of goodne&s;s, and was become habitually pious. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions made little impre&s;&s;ion on him: he la|mented the indolence in which he had &s;pent his life, talked of &s;ecret tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of telling me more to that purpo&s;e than I was willing to hear.</P>
<P>From the&s;e perturbations of mind, he had, how|ever, at times, relief. Upon a vi&s;it, that I made him &s;ome months after, I found him much altered in his &s;entiments. He &s;aid that, having reflected on the tran&s;actions of his life, and acknowledged his &s;ins before God, he felt within him&s;elf a confidence in his
<PB N="546" REF="551">
mercy, and that, tru&s;ting to the merits of his Redeemer, his mind was now in a &s;tate of perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P>In the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, he would frequently mention, with great energy and encomiums, the penitence of the man who a&s;&s;umed the name, and by that I mu&s;t call him, of George P&s;almanaazar, a Frenchman, but who pretended to be a native of the i&s;land of For|mo&s;a, and a convert from pagani&s;m to Chri&s;tianity, and, as &s;uch, received bapti&s;m. By the help of his great learning and endowments, he eluded all attempts to de|tect his impo&s;tures, but, in his more advanced age, be|came a &s;incere penitent, and, without any other mo|tive than a &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, publi&s;hed a confe&s;&s;ion of them, and begged the pardon of mankind in terms the mo&s;t humble and affecting. The remainder of his life was exemplary, and he died in 1763. The habitation of this per&s;on was in Ironmonger row, Old &s;treet, Middle&s;ex, in the neighbourhood whereof he was &s;o well known and e&s;teemed, that, as Dr Hawke&s;worth once told me, &s;carce any per&s;on, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> children, pa&s;&s;ed him without &s;hewing him the u&s;ua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;igns of re&s;pect.

endeavoured to make it believed, that he was a mere morali&s;t, and that, when writing on religious &s;ubjects, he accommodated him&s;elf to the notions of the vul|gar: and al&s;o, becau&s;e a certain female &s;ceptic, of his acquaintance, was once heard to &s;ay, that &s;he was &s;ure Dr. John&s;on was too great a philo&s;opher to be a believer.</P>
<P>From this digre&s;&s;ion, which I mean as an intro|duction to certain particulars of his behaviour in his la&s;t illne&s;s, hereafter related, I proceed to the future events of his life. In the year 1781, death put an end to the friend&s;hip that, for &s;ome years, had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Mr. Thrale, but gave birth to a relation that &s;eemed to be but a continuation of it, viz. that of an executor, the duties of which office involved in it the management of an immen&s;e trade, the di&s;po&s;al of a large fortune, and the intere&s;ts of children ri&s;ing to maturity. For the trouble it might create him, Mr. Thrale bequeathed to him, as he did to each of his other executors, a legacy of two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was not enough a man of the world to be capable alone of &s;o important a tru&s;t. Indeed, it required, for the execution of it, &s;omewhat like a board, a kind of &s;tanding council, adapted, by the &s;everal qua|lifications of the individuals that compo&s;ed it, to all emergencies. Mr. Thrale wi&s;ely fore&s;aw this, and a&s;&s;ociated with John&s;on three other per&s;ons, men of great experience in bu&s;ine&s;s, and of approved worth and integrity. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee, as John&s;on was un&s;killed in both money and commercial tran&s;actions, that Mr. Thrale's view, in con&s;tituting him one of his executors, could only be, that, by his philo&s;ophical
<PB N="548" REF="553">
prudence and &s;agacity, of which him&s;elf had, in &s;ome in&s;tances, found the benefit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A few years before Mr. Thrale's death, an emulation aro&s;e among the brewers to exceed each other in the magnitude of their ve&s;&s;els for keeping beer to a certain age, probably taking the hint from the great tun at Heidelburg. One of that trade, I think it was Mr. Whitbread, had made one that would hold &s;ome thou&s;and barrels, the thought whereof troubled Mr. Thrale, and made him repeat, from Plutarch, a &s;aying of Themi&s;tocles, <Q REND="inline">'The trophies of Miltiades hinder my &s;leeping;'</Q> John&s;on, by &s;ober rea&s;oning, quieted him, and prevented his expending a large &s;um on what could be productive of no real benefit to him or his trade.</P></NOTE>, he might give a general direction to the motions of &s;o va&s;t a machine as they had to conduct. Perhaps he might al&s;o think, that the celebrity of John&s;on's character would give a lu&s;tre to that con&s;tellation, in which he had thought proper to place him. This may be called vanity, but it &s;eems to be of the &s;ame kind with that which induced Mr. Pope to appoint Mr. Murray, now earl of Mansfield, one of the executors of his will.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had this tru&s;t devolved on him, than he applied to me for advice. He had never been an executor before, and was at a lo&s;s in the &s;teps to be taken. I told him the fir&s;t was proving the will, a term that he under&s;tood not. I explained it to him, as al&s;o the oath that would be tendered to him, faith|fully to execute it, to admini&s;ter the te&s;tator's effects according to law, and to render a true account thereof when required. I told him that in this act he would be joined by the other executors, whom, as they were all men of bu&s;ine&s;s, he would do well to follow.</P>
<P><PB N="549" REF="554">
John&s;on had all his life long been u&s;ed to lead, to direct, and in&s;truct, and did not much reli&s;h the thoughts of following men, who, in all the &s;itua|tions he could conceive, would have looked up to him: he therefore, as he afterwards confe&s;&s;ed to me, began to form theories and vi&s;ionary projects, adapted as well to the continuation and exten&s;ion of the trade, which, be it remembered, was brewing, as the di&s;po&s;al of it; but in this, as he al&s;o acknowledged, he found him&s;elf at a lo&s;s. The other executors, after reflecting on the difficulty of conducting &s;o large an undertaking, the di&s;agreeablene&s;s of an office that would render them, in effect, tax-gatherers, as all of that trade are, and place them in a &s;ituation between the public and the revenue, determined to make &s;ale of the whole, and blew up John&s;on's &s;chemes for their commencing brewers, into the air. In the carrying this re&s;olution into act, the executors had a great difficulty to encounter: Mr. Thrale's trade had been improving for two generations, and was become of &s;uch an enormous magnitude, as nothing but an ag|gregate of &s;everal fortunes was equal to; a circum|&s;tance, which could not but affect the intrin&s;ic value of the object, and increa&s;e the difficulty of finding purcha&s;ers: of things indivi&s;ible expo&s;ed to &s;ale, an e&s;timate may be formed, till their value ri&s;es to a certain amount; but, after that, a con&s;iderable abate|ment from their intrin&s;ic worth mu&s;t be made, to meet the circum&s;tance of a paucity of purcha&s;ers. This was the ca&s;e in the &s;ale of Pitt's diamond, which, in the ratio by which jewels are valued, was computed to be worth 225,000l. but, becau&s;e
<PB N="550" REF="555">
only a very few per&s;ons were able to purcha&s;e it, was &s;old to the la&s;t king of France for little more than 67,000l.</P>
<P>This difficulty, great as it was, Mr. Thrale's exe|cutors found the way to &s;urmount: they commenced a negociation with &s;ome per&s;ons of worth and cha|racter, which, being conducted on both &s;ides with fairne&s;s and candour, terminated in a conveyance of the trade, with all its appendages, for which the con|&s;ideration was, an hundred and thirty-five thou&s;and pounds. Of this arduous tran&s;action, John&s;on was little more than a &s;pectator, and, when called upon to ratify it, he readily acquie&s;ced. There only remained for him to do ju&s;tice to the memory of him, whom he could not but con&s;ider as both his friend and bene|factor, and this he did, by an exerci&s;e of his talent, in the following monumental in&s;cription:<Q>Hic conditur quod reliquum e&s;t <LB>HENRICI THRALE, <LB>Qui res &s;eu civiles, &s;eu dome&s;ticas, ita egit, <LB>Ut vitam illi longiorem multi optarent; <LB>Ita &s;acras, <LB>Ut quam brevem e&s;&s;et habiturus pre&s;cire videretur; <LB>Simplex, apertus, &s;ibique &s;emper &s;imilis, <LB>Nihil o&s;tentavit, aut arte fictum, aut cura <LB>Elaboratum. <LB>In &s;enatu, regi, patriaeque, <LB>Fideliter &s;tuduit; <LB>Vulgi ob&s;trepentis contemptor animo&s;us: <LB>Domi inter mille mercaturae negotia, <LB>Literarum elegantiam minim&egrave; neglexit, <LB>Amicis, quocunque modo laborantibus, <LB><PB N="551" REF="556">Conciliis, auctoritate, muneribus adfuit. <LB>Inter familiares, comites, convivas, ho&s;pites, <LB>Tam facili fuit morum &s;uavitate, <LB>Ut omnium animos ad &s;e alliceret; <LB>Tam felici &s;ermonis libertate, <LB>Ut nulli adulatus, omnibus placeret. <LB>Natus 1724.

<P>The death of Mr. Thrale di&s;&s;olved the friend&s;hip between him and John&s;on; but it abated not in the latter, that care for the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e whom his friend had left behind him, which he thought him&s;elf bound to cheri&s;h, as a living principle of gratitude. The favours he had received from Mr. Thrale, were to be repaid by the exerci&s;e of kind offices towards his relict and her children, and the&s;e, circum&s;tanced as John&s;on was, could only be prudent councils, friendly admonition to the one, and preceptive in|&s;truction to the others, both which he was ever ready to interpo&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, it was ob&s;erved by my&s;elf, and other of John&s;on's friends, that, &s;oon after the decea&s;e of Mr. Thrale, his vi&s;its to Streatham be|came

I commended the Thrales with great good will to God; may my petitions have been heard!'</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having now no calls, and, as I believe, very little temptation, to become a &s;ojourner, or even a gue&s;t, in the habitation of his departed friend, he had lei&s;ure to indulge him&s;elf in excur&s;ions to the city of his na|tivity, as al&s;o to Oxford; for both which places he ever entertained an enthu&s;ia&s;tic affection. In the former, he was kindly received, and re&s;pectfully treated, by Mrs. Lucy Porter, the daughter, by her former hu&s;band, of his decea&s;ed wife, and in the latter, by the reverend Dr. Adams, who had been his tutor at Pembroke college, and is now the head of that &s;eminary. While he was thus re&s;ident in the uni|ver&s;ity, he received daily proofs of the high e&s;ti|mation in which he was there held, by &s;uch mem|bers of that body as were of the greate&s;t eminence for learning, or were any way di&s;tingui&s;hed for their na|tural or acquired abilities.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the places above-mentioned, John&s;on had other &s;ummer-retreats, to which he was ever welcome, the &s;eats of his friends in the country. At one of the&s;e, in the year 1782, he was alarmed by a tumour, by &s;urgeons termed a &s;arcocele, that, as it increa&s;ed, gave him great pain, and, at length, hurried him to town, with a re&s;olution to &s;ubmit, if it &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary, to a dreadful chirurgical operation; but, on his arrival, one le&s;s &s;evere re&s;tored him to a
<PB N="553" REF="558">
&s;tate of perfect ea&s;e in the part affected. But he had di&s;orders of another kind to &s;truggle with: he had frequent fits of pain which indicated the pa&s;&s;age of a gall-&s;tone, and he now felt the pre&s;&s;ure of an a&s;thma, a con&s;titutional di&s;ea&s;e with him, from which he had formerly been relieved by copious bleedings, but his advanced age forbade the repetition of them.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the year 1782, death de|prived him of his old friend and companion; he who had, for near forty years, had the care of his health, and had attended him almo&s;t con&s;tantly every morning, to enquire after the &s;tate of his body, and fill out his tea, the mute, the officious, and the humble Mr. Levett.

This per&s;on was Mrs. Williams, who&s;e calamitous hi&s;tory is related among the events recorded in the foregoing pages. She had for &s;ome months been declining, and during the doctor's late illne&s;s was confined to her bed.

<P>During his ab&s;ence from London, viz. on the &s;ixth day of September 1783, Mrs. Williams was relea&s;ed from all her cares and troubles by an ea&s;y death, for which &s;he was well prepared. The la&s;t offices were performed for her by tho&s;e of her friends who were
<PB N="559" REF="564">
about her in the time of her illne&s;s, and had admi|ni&s;tered to her all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power.</P>
<P>At his return to London, John&s;on found him&s;elf in a forlorn and helple&s;s condition: his habitual melancholy had now a real &s;ubject to work on, and repre&s;ented his hou&s;e as a dreary man&s;ion. Soli|tude was ever ungrateful to him, and the want of a companion, with whom he might pa&s;s his evening hours, often drove him to &s;eek relief in the conver|&s;ation of per&s;ons in all re&s;pects his inferiors. To talk much, and to be well attended to, was, through|out his life, his chief delight: his vein of di&s;cour&s;e, which has often enough been de&s;cribed, was calcu|lated to attract the applau&s;e, and even admiration, of &s;mall circles; to him, therefore, a confraternity of per&s;ons, a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e of free commu|nication, or, in other words, a club, could not but be a &s;ource of plea&s;ure, and he now projected one, which will hereafter be de&s;cribed. In every a&s;&s;ociation of this kind, he was &s;ure, unle&s;s by conce&s;&s;ion, to pre|&s;ide, and, ex cathedra, to di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubjects of enquiry and debate.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Thrale, and John&s;on's e&s;trange|ment from the dwelling and family of this his valued friend, have already been mentioned: it remains to &s;ay of this event, that it was not followed by a total oblivion, on the part of his relict, of the intimacy that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and her hu&s;band, it appearing, that an intercour&s;e by letters was &s;till kept up between them. It was, neverthele&s;s, ea&s;y to di&s;cover by his conver&s;ation, that he no longer looked on him&s;elf as a welcome gue&s;t at Streatham, and that he did but ill brook the change in his cour&s;e of life that he now experienced. He had, for near twenty years, par|ticipated
<PB N="560" REF="565">
in mo&s;t of tho&s;e enjoyments that make wealth and affiuence de&s;irable; had partaken, in common with their owners, of the delights of a villa, and the convenience of an equipage; and had been entertained with a variety of amu&s;ements and occu|pations. In &s;hort, during the whole of that period, his life had been as happy as it had been in the power of &s;uch per&s;ons to make it.</P>
<P>That this celebrated friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long as it did, was a &s;ubject of wonder to mo&s;t of John|&s;on's intimates, for &s;uch were his habits of living, that he was by no means a de&s;irable inmate. His unmanly thir&s;t for tea made him very trouble&s;ome. At Streatham, he would &s;uffer the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e to &s;it up and make it for him, till two or three hours after midnight. When retired to re&s;t, he in|dulged him&s;elf in the dangerous practice of reading in bed. It was a very hard matter to get him de|cently dre&s;&s;ed by dinner-time, even when &s;elect com|panies were invited; and no one could be &s;ure, that in his table-conver&s;ation with &s;trangers, he would not, by contradiction, or the general a&s;perity of his beha|viour, offend them.</P>
<P>The&s;e irregularities were not only borne with by Mr. Thrale, but he &s;eemed to think them amply atoned for by the honour he derived from &s;uch a gue&s;t as no table in the three kingdoms could pro|duce; but, he dying, it was not likely that the &s;ame &s;entiments and opinions &s;hould de&s;cend to tho&s;e of his family who were left behind. Such a friendly con|nection and corre&s;pondence as I have ju&s;t mentioned, continued, however, between John&s;on and the widow, till it was interrupted by an event that will &s;hortly be related.</P>
<P><PB N="561" REF="566">
I have in his diary met with &s;undry notes, &s;ignifying that, while he was at Streatham, he endeavoured, by reading, to acquire a knowledge of the Dutch lan|guage, but that his progre&s;s in the &s;tudy thereof was very &s;low.</P>
<P>It has been already related that, being &s;eized with a paraly&s;is about the month of June 1783, he was &s;o far recovered therefrom, as to entertain a hope, that he had nearly worn out all his di&s;orders. <Q REND="inline">'What a man am I!'</Q> &s;aid he to me, in the month of No|vember following, <Q REND="inline">'who have got the better of three di&s;ea&s;es, the pal&s;y, the gout, and the a&s;thma, and can now enjoy the conver&s;ation of my friends, with|out the interruptions of weakne&s;s or pain!'&mdash;</Q>To the&s;e flattering te&s;timonies I mu&s;t add, that in this &s;eeming &s;pring-tide of his health and &s;pirits, he wrote me the following note:</P>

<P>With this invitation I chearfully complied, and met, at the time and place appointed, all who could be mu&s;tered of our &s;ociety, namely, John&s;on, Mr. Ryland, and Mr. Payne of the bank. When we were collected, the thought that we were &s;o few, occa|&s;ioned &s;ome melancholy reflections, and I could not but compare our meeting, at &s;uch an advanced pe|riod of life as it was to us all, to that of the four old men in the <Q REND="inline">'Senile Colloquium'</Q> of Era&s;mus. We dined, and in the evening regaled with coffee. At ten, we broke up, much to the regret of John&s;on, who propo&s;ed &s;taying; but finding us inclined to &s;eparate, he left us, with a &s;igh that &s;eemed to come from his heart, lamenting that he was retiring to &s;oli|tude and chearle&s;s meditation.</P>
<P>John&s;on had propo&s;ed a meeting, like this, once a month, and we had one more; but, the time ap|proaching for a third, he began to feel a return of &s;ome of his complaints, and &s;ignified a wi&s;h, that we would dine with him at his own hou&s;e; and, ac|cordingly, we met there, and were very chearfully entertained by him.</P>
<P><PB N="563" REF="568">
A few days after, he &s;ent for me, and informed me, that he had di&s;covered in him&s;elf the &s;ymptoms of a drop&s;y, and, indeed, his very much increa&s;ed bulk, and the &s;woln appearance of his legs, &s;eemed to in|dicate no le&s;s. He told me, that he was de&s;irous of making a will, and reque&s;ted me to be one of his executors: upon my con&s;enting to take on me the office, he gave me to under&s;tand, that he meant to make a provi&s;ion for his &s;ervant Frank, of about 70l. a year for life, and concerted with me a plan for in|ve&s;ting a &s;um &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e: at the &s;ame time he opened to me the &s;tate of his circum&s;tances, and the amount of what he had to di&s;po&s;e of.</P>
<P>In a vi&s;it, which I made him in a few days, in con|&s;equence of a very pre&s;&s;ing reque&s;t to &s;ee me, I found him labouring under great dejection of mind. He bade me draw near him, and &s;aid, he wanted to enter into a &s;erious conver&s;ation with me; and, upon my expre&s;&s;ing a willingne&s;s to join in it, he, with a look that cut me to the heart, told me, that he had the pro&s;pect of death before him, and that he dreaded to meet his Saviour. I could not but be a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch a declaration, and advi&s;ed him, as I had done once before, to reflect on the cour&s;e of his life, and the &s;er|vices he had rendered to the cau&s;e of religion and virtue, as well by his example, as his writings; to which he an&s;wered, that he had written as a philo&s;o|pher, but had not lived like one. In the e&s;timation of his offences, he rea&s;oned thus&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Every man knows his own &s;ins, and al&s;o, what grace he has re&s;i&s;ted. But, to tho&s;e of others, and the circum&s;tances under which they were committed, he is a &s;tranger: he is, there|fore, to look on him&s;elf as the greate&s;t &s;inner that
<PB N="564" REF="569">
he knows of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I find the above &s;entiment in Law's Serious call to a devout and holy life, a book which John&s;on was very conver&s;ant with, and often commended.</NOTE>.'</Q> At the conclu&s;ion of this argument, which he &s;trongly enforced, he uttered this pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Shall I, who have been a teacher of others, my&s;elf be a ca&s;taway?'</Q></P>
<P>Much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e pa&s;&s;ed between us in this and other conver&s;ations that I had with him, in all which I could not but wonder, as much at the freedom with which he opened his mind, and the compunc|tion he &s;eemed to feel for the errors of his pa&s;t life, as I did, at his making choice of me for his confe&s;&s;or, knowing full well how meanly qualified I was for &s;uch an office.</P>
<P>It was on a Thur&s;day that I had this conver&s;ation with him; and here, let not the &s;upercilious lip of &s;corn protrude it&s;elf, while I relate that, in the cour&s;e thereof, he declared his intention to devote the whole of the next day to fa&s;ting, humiliation, and &s;uch other devotional exerci&s;es, as became a man in his &s;ituation. On the Saturday following, I made him a vi&s;it, and, upon entering his room, ob&s;erved in his countenance &s;uch a &s;erenity, as indicated that &s;ome re|markable cri&s;is of his di&s;order had produced a change in his feelings. He told me, that, pur&s;uant to the re|&s;olution he had mentioned to me, he had &s;pent the preceding day in an ab&s;traction from all worldly con|cerns; that, to prevent interruption, he had, in the morning, ordered Frank not to admit any one to him, and, the better to enforce the charge, had added the&s;e awful words, <Q REND="inline">'For your ma&s;ter is preparing him&s;elf to die.'</Q> He then mentioned to me, that, in the
<PB N="565" REF="570">
cour&s;e of this exerci&s;e, he found him&s;elf relieved from that di&s;order which had been growing on him, and was become very oppre&s;&s;ing, the drop&s;y, by a gradual evacuation of water to the amount of twenty pints, a like in&s;tance whereof he had never before experienced, and a&s;ked me what I thought of it.</P>
<P>I was well aware of the lengths that &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m will lead men, and how ready &s;ome are to attribute favourable events to &s;upernatural cau&s;es, and &s;aid, that it might &s;avour of pre&s;umption to &s;ay that, in this in&s;tance, God had wrought a miracle; yet, as divines recognize certain di&s;pen&s;ations of his provi|dence, recorded in the Scripture by the denomination of returns of prayer, and his omnipotence is now the &s;ame as ever, I thought it would be little le&s;s than criminal, to a&s;cribe his late relief to cau&s;es merely natural, and, that the &s;afer opinion was, that he had not in vain humbled him&s;elf before his Maker. He &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce in all that I &s;aid on this important &s;ubject, and, &s;everal times, while I was di&s;cour&s;ing with him, cried out, <Q REND="inline">'It is wonderful, very won|derful!'</Q></P>
<P>His zeal for religion, as manife&s;ted in his writings and conver&s;ation, and the accounts extant that atte&s;t his piety, have induced the enemies to his memory to tax him with &s;uper&s;tition. To that charge, I oppo&s;e his behaviour on this occa&s;ion, and leave it to the judgment of &s;ober and rational per&s;ons, whether &s;uch an unexpected event, as that above-mentioned, would not have prompted a really &s;uper&s;titious man, to &s;ome more pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation, than that it was won|derful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Doubtle&s;s there are men who look upon all religious excerci&s;es as &s;uper&s;tition, and upon prayer and other acts of devotion, as evi|dences of a weak mind. The&s;e &s;ay, that rea&s;on is a &s;ufficient rule of action, and that God needs not to be &s;upplicated, nor requires our thanks. Of this cla&s;s of infidels I take Annet to have been one: he who wrote again&s;t the miracles, and was &s;ome years ago convicted of bla&s;phemy, and &s;entenced to impri&s;onment. The wife of Jack|&s;on, the book&s;eller, in Clare court, Drury lane, a man well known by the collectors of old books and pamphlets, once told me, that this man would often call in at their &s;hop, and if he happened to &s;ee a bible lying on the counter, would intreat her to take it away, for that he could not bear the &s;ight of it.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="566" REF="571">
He had no &s;ooner experienced the ea&s;e and comfort which followed from the remarkable event above|mentioned, than he began to entertain a hope, that he had got the better of that di&s;ea&s;e which mo&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ed him, and that length of days might yet be his portion; he, therefore, &s;ought for a relief from that &s;olitude, to which the lo&s;s of Mrs. Williams and others of his dome&s;tic companions, &s;eemed to have doomed him; and, in the &s;ame &s;pirit that induced him to at|tempt the revival of the Ivy lane club, &s;et about the e&s;tabli&s;hment of another. I was not made privy to this his intention, but, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, it was no matter of &s;urpri&s;e to me when I heard, as I did from a friend of mine, that the great Dr. John&s;on had, in the month of December 1783, formed a &s;ix|penny club, at an ale-hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex-&s;treet, and that, though &s;ome of the members thereof were per&s;ons of note, &s;trangers, under re&s;trictions, for three pence each night, might, three nights in a week, hear him talk, and partake of his conver&s;ation. I &s;oon after|wards learned from the doctor, the nature of, as al&s;o the motives to this in&s;titution, which, as to him, was novel, in this re&s;pect, that, as the pre&s;idency
<PB N="567" REF="572">
pa&s;&s;ed in rotation, he was oftner excluded from, than entitled to enjoy, that pre-eminence which, at all times, and in all convivial a&s;&s;emblies, was con&s;idered as his right.</P>
<P>The more intimate of John&s;on's friends looked on this e&s;tabli&s;hment, both as a &s;orry expedient to kill time, and a degradation of tho&s;e powers which had admini&s;tered delight to circles, compo&s;ed of per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, di&s;tingui&s;hed as well by their rank, as by their talents for polite conver&s;ation. It was a mortification to them, to a&s;&s;ociate in idea the clink of the tankard, with moral di&s;qui&s;ition and literary inve&s;|tigation; and many of them were led to que&s;tion whether that plea&s;ure could be very great, which he had rendered &s;o cheap: they, however, concealed their &s;entiments, and, from motives of mere com|pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uffered him to enjoy a comfort, which was now become almo&s;t the only one of which he was capable; and this he did for the &s;hort &s;pace of about ten months, when the increa&s;e of his complaints ob|liged him to forego it.</P>
<P>I have now brought him to the &s;eventy-fifth year of his age, and the la&s;t of his life, in which two re|markable events occurred, the one whereof gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s, and the other, though much talked of, little or none. The time I am &s;peaking of, is the year 1784, by about the middle whereof, he was, to appearance, &s;o well recovered, that both him&s;elf and his friends hoped, that he had &s;ome years to live. He had recovered from the paralytic &s;troke of the la&s;t year, to &s;uch a degree, that, &s;aving a little diffi|culty in his articulation, he had no remains of it: he had al&s;o undergone a &s;light fit of the gout, and
<PB N="568" REF="573">
conquered an oppre&s;&s;ion on his lungs, &s;o as to be able, as him&s;elf told me, to run up the whole &s;tair-ca&s;e of the Royal Academy, on the day of the annual dinner there. In &s;hort, to &s;uch a degree of health was he re&s;tored, that he forgot all his complaints: he re&s;umed &s;itting to Opie for his picture, which had been begun the year before, but, I believe, was never fini&s;hed, and accepted an invitation to the hou&s;e of a friend, at A&s;hbourn in Derby&s;hire, propo&s;ing to &s;tay there till towards the end of the &s;ummer, and, in his return, to vi&s;it Mrs. Porter, his daughter-in-law, and others of his friends, at Lichfield.</P>
<P>A few weeks before his &s;etting out, he was made unea&s;y by a report, that the widow of his friend Mr. Thrale was about to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf in marriage to a foreigner, a &s;inger by profe&s;&s;ion, and with him to quit the kingdom. Upon this occa&s;ion he took the alarm, and to prevent a degradation of her&s;elf, and, what as executor of her hu&s;band was more his con|cern, the de&s;ertion of her children, wrote to her, &s;he then being at Bath, a letter, a &s;purious copy whereof, beginning <Q REND="inline">'If you are not already ignominiou&s;ly married,'</Q> is in&s;erted in the Gentleman's Magazine for December 1784. That this letter is &s;purious, as to the language, I have John&s;on's own authority for &s;aying; but, in re&s;pect of the &s;entiments, he avowed it, in a declaration to me, that not a &s;entence of it was his, but yet, that it was an <HI>adumbration</HI> of one that he wrote upon the occa&s;ion. It may, therefore, be &s;u&s;|pected, that &s;ome one who had heard him repeat the contents of the letter, had given it to the public in the form in which it appeared.</P>
<P>What an&s;wer was returned to his friendly monition,
<PB N="569" REF="574">
I know not, but it &s;eems that it was &s;ucceeded by a letter of greater length, written, as it afterwards ap|peared, too late to do any good, in which he expre&s;&s;ed an opinion, that the per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed had forfeited her fame. The an&s;wer to this I have &s;een: it is written from Bath, and contains an indignant vin|dication as well of her conduct as her fame, an inhi|bition of John&s;on from following her to Bath, and a farewell, concluding&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Till you have changed your opinion of&mdash;let us conver&s;e no more.'</Q></P>
<P>In this tran&s;action, John&s;on &s;eemed to have for|gotten the &s;tory of the Ephe&s;ian Matron, related by Petronius, but was, by this time, convinced that, in his endeavours to prevent an attachment, which he fore&s;aw would be prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of his friend's children, and fix an indelible di&s;grace on their mother, who was about to abandon them and her country, he had been labouring to hedge in the cuckow. From the &s;tyle of the letter, a conclu&s;ion was to be drawn, that baffled all the powers of rea|&s;oning and per&s;ua&s;ion:
<Q><L>One argument &s;he &s;umm'd up all in,</L>
<L>The thing was done, and pa&s;t recalling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Pope and Swift's Mi&s;cellanies, <Q REND="inline">'Phyllis or the Progre&s;s of love.'</Q></P></NOTE>;</L></Q>
which being the ca&s;e, he contented him&s;elf with re|flecting on what he had done to prevent that which he thought one of the greate&s;t evils that could befall the progeny of his friend, the alienation of the affec|tions of their mother. He looked upon the de&s;er|tion of children by their parents, and the withdrawing from them that protection, that mental nutriment which, in their youth, they are capable of receiving, the expo&s;ing them to the &s;nares and temptations of
<PB N="570" REF="575">
the world, and the &s;olicitations and deceits of the artful and de&s;igning, as mo&s;t unnatural; and, in a letter on the &s;ubject to me, written from A&s;hbourn, thus delivered his &s;entiments:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Poor Thrale! I thought that either her virtue or her vice,' [meaning, as I under&s;tood, by the former, the love of her children, and, by the latter, her pride,] 'would have re&s;trained her from &s;uch a marriage. She is now become a &s;ubject for her enemies to exult over, and for her friends, if &s;he has any left, to forget or pity.'</Q></P>
<P>In the mention of the above particulars, it is far from my de&s;ign to reprehend the conduct of the lady to whom they relate. Being her own mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he had a right to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf, and is unamenable to any known judicature. John&s;on, in his relation of executor to her hu&s;band, as al&s;o in gratitude to his memory, was under an obligation to promote the welfare of his family. It was al&s;o his duty, as far as he was able, to avert an evil which threatened their intere&s;ts. What he endeavoured, for that purpo&s;e, is part of his hi&s;tory, and, as &s;uch only, I relate it.</P>
<P>While Dr. John&s;on was in the country, his friends in town were labouring for his benefit. Mr. Thrale, a &s;hort time before his death, had meditated a journey to Italy, and formed a party, in which John&s;on was in|cluded, but the de&s;ign never took effect. It was now conceived, by John&s;on's friends, that a foreign air would contribute to the re&s;toration of his health; and his inclination concurring with their &s;entiments, a plan was formed for his vi&s;iting the continent, attended with a male-&s;ervant. The only ob&s;tacle to the journey was, an apprehen&s;ion, that the expence of it would be
<PB N="571" REF="576">
greater than his income would bear; and, to get over this difficulty, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds undertook to &s;oli|cit an addition of 200l. to his pen&s;ion, and to that end, applied to lord Thurlow, who, as the public have been fully informed, exerted his endeavours for the purpo&s;e, but the application failing, he de|clared him&s;elf willing, upon the &s;ecurity of that pen|&s;ion of which John&s;on was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to advance him 500l<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The offer above-mentioned has, in the fir&s;t view of it, the appearance rather of a commercial than a gratuitous tran&s;action; but Sir Jo&s;hua clearly under&s;tood at the making it, that lord Thurlow de&s;ignedly put it in that form: he was fearful that John&s;on's high &s;pirit would induce him to reject it as a donation, but thought that, in the way of a loan, it might be accepted.</NOTE>. This generous offer John&s;on thought proper to decline by a letter, of which the following is an authentic copy, being taken from his own draft now in my hands.<LETTER>

It was given to Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, un&s;ealed, to be delivered to lord Thurlow. Sir Jo&s;hua, looking upon it as a hand&s;ome te&s;timony of gratitude, and, as it related to a tran&s;action in which he had concerned him&s;elf, took a copy of it, and &s;hewed it to a few of his friends. Among the&s;e, was a lady of quality, who, having heard it red, the next day de&s;ired to be gratified with the peru&s;al of it at home: the u&s;e &s;he made of this favour was, the copying and &s;ending it to one of the news-papers,

whence it was taken and in&s;erted in others, as al&s;o in the Gentleman's and many other Magazines.

<P>In his return to London, he &s;topped at Lichfield, and from thence wrote to me &s;everal letters, that &s;erved but to prepare me for meeting him in a wor&s;e &s;tate of health than I had ever &s;een him in. The concluding paragraph of the la&s;t of them is as follows: <Q REND="inline">'I am relap&s;ing into the drop&s;y very fa&s;t, and &s;hall make &s;uch ha&s;te to town that it will be u&s;ele&s;s to write to me; but when I come, let me have the benefit of your advice, and the con&s;olation of your company.' [dated Nov. 7, 1784.]</Q> After about a fortnight's &s;tay there, he took his leave of that city, and of Mrs. Porter, whom he never afterwards &s;aw, and arrived in town on the &s;ixteenth day of No|vember.</P>
<P>After the declaration he had made of his intention to provide for his &s;ervant Frank, and before his going into the country, I had frequently pre&s;&s;ed him to make a will, and had gone &s;o far as to make a draft of one, with blanks for the names of the executors and re&s;iduary legatee, and directing in what manner it was to be executed and atte&s;ted; but he was exceedingly aver&s;e to this bu&s;ine&s;s; and, while he was in Derby&s;hire, I repeated my &s;olicitations, for this purpo&s;e, by letters. When he arrived in town, he had done nothing in it, and, to what I formerly &s;aid, I now added, that he had never mentioned to me the di&s;po&s;al of the re&s;idue of his e&s;tate, which,
<PB N="576" REF="581">
after the purcha&s;e of an annuity for Frank, I found would be &s;omething con&s;iderable, and that he would do well to bequeath it to his relations. His an&s;wer was, <Q REND="inline">'I care not what becomes of the re&s;idue.'&mdash;</Q>A few days after, it appeared that he had executed the draft, the blanks remaining, with all the &s;olemnities of a real will. I could get him no farther, and thus, for &s;ome time, the matter re&s;ted.</P>
<P>He had &s;carce arrived in town, before it was found to be too true, that he was relap&s;ing into a drop&s;y; and farther, that he was at times grievou&s;ly afflicted with an a&s;thma. Under an apprehen&s;ion that his end was ap|proaching, he enquired of Dr. Brockle&s;by, with great earne&s;tne&s;s indeed, how long he might probably live, but could obtain no other than un&s;atisfactory an&s;wers: and, at the &s;ame time, if I remember right, under a &s;eeming great pre&s;&s;ure of mind, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him, in the words of Shake&s;peare:<Q><L>Can&s;t thou not mini&s;ter to a mind di&s;eas'd;</L>

He had, from the month of July in this year, mark|ed the progre&s;s of his di&s;ea&s;es, in a journal which he intitled <Q REND="inline">'Aegri Ephemeris,'</Q> noting therein his many &s;leeple&s;s nights by the words, Nox in&s;omnis. This he often contemplated, and, finding very little ground for hope that he had much longer to live, he &s;et him|&s;elf to prepare for his di&s;&s;olution, and betook him&s;elf to private prayer and the reading of Era&s;mus on the New Te&s;tament, Dr. Clarke's &s;ermons, and &s;uch other books as had a tendency to calm and comfort him.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of his body and mind, he &s;eemed to be very anxious in the di&s;charge of two offices that he had hitherto neglected to perform: one was, the com|municating to the world the names of the per&s;ons con|cerned in the compilation of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory; the other was, the re&s;cuing from oblivion the memory of his father and mother, and al&s;o, of his brother: the former of the&s;e he di&s;charged, by delivering to Mr. Nichols the printer, in my pre&s;ence, a paper con|taining the information above-mentioned, and direc|tions to depo&s;it it in the Briti&s;h mu&s;eum. The other, by compo&s;ing a memorial of his decea&s;ed parents and his brother, intended for their tomb-&s;tone, which, whether it was ever in&s;cribed thereon or not, is extant in the Gentleman's Magazine for January 1785.

Upon my &s;itting down, he &s;aid, that the pro&s;pect of the change he was about to un|dergo, and the thought of meeting his Saviour, trou|bled him, but that he had hope that he would not reject him. I then began to di&s;cour&s;e with him about his will, and the provi&s;ion for Frank, till he grew angry. He told me, that he had &s;igned and &s;ealed the paper I left him;&mdash;but that, &s;aid I, had blanks in it, which, as it &s;eems, you have not filled up with the names of the executors.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'You &s;hould have filled them up your&s;elf,'</Q> an&s;wered he.&mdash;I replied, that &s;uch an act would have looked as if I meant to prevent his choice of a fitter per&s;on.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Sir,' &s;aid he, 'the&s;e minor virtues are not to be exerci&s;ed in matters of &s;uch importance as this.'&mdash;</Q>At length, he &s;aid, that on his return home, he would &s;end for a clerk, and dictate a will to him.&mdash;You will then, &s;aid I, be inops con&s;ilii; rather do it now.

<P>30th. I &s;aw him in the evening, and found him chearful. Was informed, that he had, for his dinner, eaten heartily of a French duck pie and a phea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Dec. 1. He was bu&s;ied in de&s;troying papers.&mdash;Gave to Mr. Langton and another per&s;on, to fair copy, &s;ome tran&s;lations of the Greek epigrams, which he had made in the preceding nights, and tran&s;cribed the next morning, and they began to work on them.</P>
<P>3d. Finding his legs continue to &s;well, he &s;igni|fied to his phy&s;icians a &s;trong de&s;ire to have them &s;carified, but they, unwilling to put him to pain, and fearing a mortification, declined advi&s;ing it. He afterwards con&s;ulted his &s;urgeon, and he performed the operation on one leg.</P>
<P>4th. I vi&s;ited him: the &s;carification, made ye&s;terday in his leg, appeared to have had little effect.&mdash;He &s;aid to me, that he was ea&s;ier in his mind, and as fit to die at that in&s;tant, as he could be a year hence.&mdash;He re|que&s;ted me to receive the &s;acrament with him on Sunday, the next day. Complained of great weak|ne&s;s, and of phantoms that haunted his imagination.</P>
<P>5th. Being Sunday, I communicated with him and Mr. Langton, and other of his friends, as many as nearly filled the room. Mr. Strahan, who was con&s;tant in his attendance on him throughout his illne&s;s, performed the office. Previous to reading the exhortation, John&s;on knelt, and, with a degree of fervour that I had never been witne&s;s to before,
<PB N="584" REF="589">
uttered the following mo&s;t eloquent and energetic prayer:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Almighty and mo&s;t merciful Father, I am now, as to human eyes it &s;eems, about to commemorate, for the la&s;t time, the death of thy &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Saviour and Redeemer. Grant, O Lord, that my whole hope and confidence may be in his me|rits and in thy mercy: forgive and accept my late conver&s;ion; enforce and accept my imperfect repen|tance; make this commemoration of him available to the confirmation of my faith, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of my hope, and the enlargement of my charity; and make the death of thy &s;on Je&s;us effectual to my re|demption. Have mercy upon me, and pardon the multitude of my offences. Ble&s;s my friends, have mercy upon all men. Support me by the grace of they holy &s;pirit in the days of weakne&s;s, and at the hour of death, and receive me, at my death, to ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;Amen.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon ri&s;ing from his knees, after the office was concluded, he &s;aid, that he dreaded to meet God in a &s;tate of idiocy, or with opium in his head; and, that having now communicated with the effects of a do&s;e upon him, he doubted if his exertions were the genuine operations of his mind, and repeated from bi&s;hop Taylor this &s;entiment, <Q REND="inline">'That little, that has been omitted in health, can be done to any purpo&s;e in &s;ickne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He very much admired, and often in the cour&s;e of his illne&s;s recited, from the conclu&s;ion of old I&s;aac Walton's life of bi&s;hop Sander&s;on, the following pathetic reque&s;t:</P> <P><Q REND="inline">'Thus this pattern of meekne&s;s and primitive innocence changed this for a better life:&mdash;'tis now too late to wi&s;h, that mine may be like his; for I am in the eighty-fifth year of my age, and God knows it hath not; but, I mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech Almighty God, that my death may; and I do as earn|e&s;tly beg, that, if any reader &s;hall receive any &s;atisfaction from this very plain, and, as true relation, he will be &s;o charitable as to &s;ay, Amen.'</Q></P></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="585" REF="590">
6th. I again vi&s;ited him. Before my departure, Dr. Brockle&s;by came in, and, taking him by the wri&s;t, John&s;on gave him a look of great contempt, and ri|diculed the judging of his di&s;order by the pul&s;e. He complained, that the &s;arcocele had again made its appearance, and a&s;ked, if a puncture would not relieve him, as it had done the year before: the doctor an&s;wered, that it might, but that his &s;urgeon was the be&s;t judge of the effect of &s;uch an operation. John&s;on, upon this, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'How many men in a year die through the timidity of tho&s;e whom they con|&s;ult for health! I want length of life, and you fear giving me pain, which I care not for.'</Q></P>
<P>8th. I vi&s;ited him with Mr. Langton, and found him dictating to Mr. Strahan another will, the former being, as he had &s;aid at the time of making it, a tem|porary one. On our entering the room, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'God ble&s;s you both.'</Q> I arrived ju&s;t time enough to direct the execution, and al&s;o the atte&s;tation of it. After he had publi&s;hed it, he de&s;ired Mr. Strahan to &s;ay the Lord's prayer, which he did, all of us joining. John&s;on, after it, uttered, extempore, a few pious ejaculations.</P>
<P>9th. I &s;aw him in the evening, and found him dictating, to Mr. Strahan, a codicil to the will he had
<PB N="586" REF="591">
made the evening before. I a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in it, and received from the te&s;tator a direction, to in&s;ert a devi&s;e to his executors of the hou&s;e at Lichfield, to be &s;old for the benefit of certain of his relations, a beque&s;t of &s;undry pecuniary and &s;pecific legacies, a provi&s;ion for the annuity of 70l. for Francis, and, after all, a devi&s;e of all the re&s;t, re&s;idue, and remainder of his e&s;tate and effects, to his executors, in tru&s;t for the &s;aid Francis Barber, his executors and admini&s;trators; and, having dictated accordingly, John&s;on executed and publi&s;hed it as a codicil to his will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How much &s;oever I approve of the practice of rewarding the fidelity of &s;ervants, I cannot but think that, in te&s;tamentary di&s;po&s;i|tions in their favour, &s;ome di&s;cretion ought to be exerci&s;ed; and that, in &s;carce any in&s;tance they are to be preferred to tho&s;e who are al|lied to the te&s;tator either in blood or by affinity. Of the merits of this &s;ervant, a judgment may be formed from what I &s;hall here|after have occa&s;ion to &s;ay of him. It was hinted to me many years ago, by his ma&s;ter, that he was a loo&s;e fellow; and I learned from others, that, after an ab&s;ence from his &s;ervice of &s;ome years, he married. In his &s;earch of a wife, he picked up one of tho&s;e crea|tures with whom, in the di&s;po&s;al of them&s;elves, no contrariety of colour is an ob&s;tacle. It is &s;aid, that &s;oon after his marriage, he became jealous, and, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he continued &s;o, till, by pre&s;enting him fir&s;t with one, and afterwards with another daugh|ter, of her own colour, his wife put an end to all his doubts on that &s;core. Notwith&s;tanding which, John&s;on, in the exce&s;s of indi&s;crimi|nating benevolence, about a year before his death, took the wife and both the children, into his hou&s;e, and made them a part of his family; and, by the codicil to his will, made a di&s;po&s;ition in his favour, to the amount in value of full fifteen hundred pounds.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He was now &s;o weak as to be unable to kneel, and lamented, that he mu&s;t pray &s;itting, but, with an effort, he placed him&s;elf on his knees, while Mr. Strahan repeated the Lord's Prayer. During the whole of the evening, he was much compo&s;ed and re|&s;igned. Being become very weak and helple&s;s, it was
<PB N="587" REF="592">
thought nece&s;&s;ary that a man &s;hould watch with him all night; and one was found in the neighbourhood, who, for half a crown a night, undertook to &s;it up with, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him. When the man had left the room, he, in the pre&s;ence and hearing of Mr. Stra|han and Mr. Langton, a&s;ked me, where I meant to bury him. I an&s;wered, doubtle&s;s, in We&s;tmin&s;ter abbey: <Q REND="inline">'If,' &s;aid he, 'my executors think it proper to mark the &s;pot of my interment by a &s;tone, let it be &s;o placed as to protect my body from injury.'</Q> I a&s;&s;ured him it &s;hould be done. Before my departure, he de&s;ired Mr. Langton to put into my hands, money to the amount of upwards of 100l. with a direction to keep it till called for.</P>
<P>10th. This day at noon I &s;aw him again. He &s;aid to me, that the male nur&s;e to who&s;e care I had com|mitted him, was unfit for the office. <Q REND="inline">'He is,' &s;aid he, 'an idiot, as aukward as a turn&s;pit ju&s;t put into the wheel, and as &s;leepy as a dormou&s;e.'</Q> Mr. Cruik|&s;hank came into the room, and, looking on his &s;cari|fied leg, &s;aw no &s;ign of a mortification.</P>
<P>11th. At noon, I found him dozing, and would not di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>12th. Saw him again; found him very weak, and, as he &s;aid, unable to pray.</P>
<P>13th. At noon, I called at the hou&s;e, but went not into his room, being told, that he was dozing. I was further informed by the &s;ervants, that his appetite was totally gone, and that he could take no &s;u&s;tenance. At eight in the evening, of the &s;ame day, word was brought me by Mr. Sa&s;tres, to whom, in his la&s;t moments, he uttered the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">'Jam moriturus,'</Q> that, at a quarter pa&s;t &s;even, he had, without a groan, or the lea&s;t &s;ign of pain or unea&s;ine&s;s, yielded his la&s;t breath.</P>
<P><PB N="588" REF="593">
At eleven, the &s;ame evening, Mr. Langton came to me, and, in an agony of mind, gave me to under|&s;tand, that our friend had wounded him&s;elf in &s;everal parts of the body. I was &s;hocked at the news; but, upon being told that he had not touched any vital part, was ea&s;ily able to account for an action, which would el&s;e have given us the deepe&s;t concern. The fact was, that conceiving him&s;elf to be full of water, he had done that, which he had often &s;olicited his medical a&s;&s;i&s;tants to do, made two or three inci&s;ions in his lower limbs, vainly hoping for &s;ome relief from the flux that might follow.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, Frank came to me; and, being de&s;irous of knowing all the particulars of this tran&s;action, I interrogated him very &s;trictly concerning it, and received from him an&s;wers to the following effect:</P>
<P>That, at eight in the morning of the preceding day, upon going into the bedchamber, his ma&s;ter, being in bed, ordered him to open a cabinet, and give him a drawer in it; that he did &s;o, and that out of it his ma&s;ter took a ca&s;e of lancets, and choo&s;ing one of them, would have conveyed it into the bed, which Frank, and a young man that &s;at up with him, &s;eeing, they &s;eized his hand, and intreated him not to do a ra&s;h action: he &s;aid he would not; but drawing his hand under the bed-clothes, they &s;aw his arm move. Upon this, they turned down the clothes, and &s;aw a great effu&s;ion of blood, which &s;oon &s;topped&mdash;That &s;oon after, he got at a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars that lay in a drawer by him, and plunged them deep in the calf of each leg&mdash;That immediately they &s;ent for Mr. Cruik&s;hank, and the apothecary, and they, or one of them, dre&s;&s;ed the wounds&mdash;That he then fell into that dozing which
<PB N="589" REF="594">
carried him off.&mdash;That it was conjectured he lo&s;t eight or ten ounces of blood; and that this effu&s;ion brought on the dozing, though his pul&s;e continued firm till three o'clock.</P>
<P>That this act was not done to ha&s;ten his end, but to di&s;charge the water that he conceived to be in him, I have not the lea&s;t doubt. A drop&s;y was his di&s;ea&s;e; he looked upon him&s;elf as a bloated carca&s;e; and, to attain the power of ea&s;y re&s;piration, would have un|dergone any degree of temporary pain. He dreaded neither punctures nor inci&s;ions, and, indeed, defied the trochar and the lancet: he had often reproached his phy&s;icians and &s;urgeon with cowardice; and, when Mr. Cruik&s;hank &s;carified his leg, he cried out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Deeper, deeper;&mdash;I will abide the con&s;equence: you are afraid of your reputation, but that is no|thing to me.'&mdash;</Q>To tho&s;e about him, he &s;aid,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'You all pretend to love me, but you do not love me &s;o well as I my&s;elf do.'</Q></P>
<P>I have been thus minute in recording the parti|culars of his la&s;t moments, becau&s;e I wi&s;hed to attract attention to the conduct of this great man, under the mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances human nature is &s;ubject to. Many per&s;ons have appeared po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more &s;erenity of mind in this awful &s;cene; &s;ome have remained unmoved at the di&s;&s;o|lution of the vital union; and, it may be deemed a di&s;couragement from the &s;evere practice of religion, that Dr. John&s;on, who&s;e whole life was a preparation for his death, and a conflict with natural infirmity, was di&s;turbed with terror at the pro&s;pect of the grave. Let not this relax the circum&s;pection of any one. It is true, that natural firmne&s;s of &s;pirit, or the
<PB N="90" REF="595">
confidence of hope, may buoy up the mind to the la&s;t; but, however heroic an undaunted death may appear, it is not what we &s;hould pray for. As John&s;on lived the life of the righteous, his end was that of a Chri&s;tian: he &s;trictly fulfilled the injunction of the apo&s;tle, to work out his &s;alvation with fear and trembling; and, though his doubts and &s;cruples were certainly very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to him&s;elf, they give his friends a pious hope, that he, who added to almo&s;t all the virtues of Chri&s;tianity, that religious humi|lity which its great Teacher inculcated, will, in the fullne&s;s of time, receive the reward promi&s;ed to a patient continuance in well-doing.</P>
<P>A few days after his departure, Dr. Brockle&s;by and Mr. Cruik&s;hank, who, with great a&s;&s;iduity and huma|nity, (and I mu&s;t add, genero&s;ity, for neither they, nor Dr. Heberden, Dr. Warren, nor Dr. Butter, would accept any fees) had attended him, &s;ignified a wi&s;h, that his body might be opened. This was done, and the report made was to this effect:<LIST>

<P>On Monday the 20th of December, his funeral was celebrated and honoured by a numerous attendance of his friends, and among them, by particular invi|tation, of as many of the literary club as were then in town, and not prevented by engagements. The dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter, upon my application, would
<PB N="591" REF="596">
gladly have performed the ceremony of his interment, but, at the time, was much indi&s;po&s;ed in his health; the office, therefore, devolved upon the &s;enior pre|bendary, Dr. Taylor, who performed it with becoming gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. All the prebendaries, except &s;uch as were ab&s;ent in the country, attended in their &s;urplices and hoods: they met the corp&s;e at the we&s;t door of their church, and performed, in the mo&s;t re&s;|pectful manner, all the honours due to the memory of &s;o great a man.</P>
<P>His body, enclo&s;ed in a leaden coffin, is depo&s;ited in the &s;outh tran&s;ept of the abbey, near the foot of Shake&s;|peare's monument, and clo&s;e to the coffin of his friend Garrick.

(the &s;um which the hou&s;e at Lichfield produced at a &s;ale by auction) who, being five in number, divided the &s;ame, after deducting the expences of the &s;ale, in the following proportions; that is to &s;ay, three of the relations took 58l. 15s. 0d. each, and each of two others, the repre&s;entatives of a fourth, 29l. 7s. 6d.</P>
<P>A few days after the doctor's decea&s;e, Francis came to me, and informed me, that a relation of his ma&s;ter's, named Humphrey Heely, who, with his wife, had lately, upon the reque&s;t of the doctor to the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, been placed in an alms-hou&s;e at We&s;t|min&s;ter, was in great nece&s;&s;ity, as wanting money to buy bedding and cloaths. I told him, that &s;eeing he was &s;o great a gainer by his ma&s;ter's will, as to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of almo&s;t the whole of his fortune, it behoved him to have compa&s;&s;ion on this his rela|tion, and to &s;upply his wants. His reply was,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'<HI>I cannot afford it.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="597" REF="602">
From the time of the doctor's decea&s;e, my&s;elf, and my colleagues the other executors, an&s;wered all the calls of Francis for money. On the 6th day of Sep|tember 1785, we had advanced him 106l. By the 13th of December following, he had received of Mr. Langton for his annuity, and of Me&s;&s;. Barclay and Perkins for intere&s;t, as much as made that &s;um 183l. and on the 15th of the &s;ame month, a year and two days after his ma&s;ter's death, he came to me, &s;aying, that he wanted more money, for that a few halfpence was all that he had left. Upon my &s;ettling with him in Augu&s;t la&s;t, it appeared that, exclu&s;ive of his annuity, he had received 337l. and, after delivering to him the bond for 150l. mentioned in the will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had before received 45l. for intere&s;t thereon.</NOTE>, I paid him a balance of 196l. 15s. 4d.&frac34;.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner clo&s;ed my account, than I &s;ent for Heely, who appeared to be an old man and lame, having one leg much &s;horter than the other, but of an excellent under&s;tanding. The &s;tyle of his di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o correct and grammatical, that it called to my remembrance that of John&s;on. The account he gave me of him|&s;elf and his fortunes was to the following effect:</P>
<P>That he was born in the year 1714, and that his relation to John&s;on was by marriage, his fir&s;t wife being a Ford, and the daughter of John&s;on's mother's brother.&mdash;That him&s;elf had been a whole&s;ale iron-monger, and the owner of an e&s;tate in Warwick&s;hire, which he farmed him&s;elf, but that lo&s;&s;es, and &s;ome in|di&s;cretions on his part, had driven him to Scotland; and that, in his return on foot, with his wife, from
<PB N="598" REF="603">
Newca&s;tle, &s;he died on the road in his arms;&mdash;that, &s;ome years after, he was, by Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, made keeper of the Tap at Ranelagh hou&s;e, and that he married again; but that not being able to endure the capricious in&s;olence with which he was treated, Mr. Garrick took him under his protection, and would have found a place for him in his theatre, but lived not to be able to do it; and that the&s;e, and other misfor|tunes and di&s;appointments, had brought him to the condition, as he de&s;cribed it, of a poor, re|duced old man.&mdash;He added, that Dr. John&s;on had been very liberal to him; and, as one in&s;tance of his kindne&s;s, mentioned, that, about three weeks before his decea&s;e, he had applied to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, upon &s;tating his rea&s;ons for troubling him, was bid, rather har&s;hly, to be &s;ilent,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'For,' &s;aid the doctor, 'it is enough to &s;ay that you are in want; I enquire not into the cau&s;es of it: here is money for your relief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have here an in&s;tance of that a&s;perity of temper with which John&s;on has been frequently charged, but without any al|lowance for natural infirmity, or any con&s;ideration of his endeavours to correct it, or his readine&s;s to atone for the pain it might &s;ome|times give, by a kind and gentle treatment of the per&s;on offended. The truth of the matter is, that his whole life was a conflict with his pa&s;&s;ions and humours, and that few per&s;ons bore reprehen&s;ion with more patience than him&s;elf. After his decea&s;e, I found among his papers an anonymous letter, that &s;eemed to have been written by a per&s;on who had long had his eye on him, and remarked the offen&s;ive particulars in his behaviour, his propen&s;ity to contradic|tion, his want of deference to the opinions of others, his conten|tion for victory over tho&s;e with whom he di&s;puted, his local preju|dices and aver&s;ions, and other his evil habits in converiation, which made his acquaintance &s;hunned by many, who, as a man of genius and worth, highly e&s;teemed him. It was written with great temper, in a &s;pirit of charity, and with a due acknowledgment of tho&s;e great talents with which he was endowed, but contained in it &s;everal home truths. In &s;hort, it was &s;uch a letter as many a one on the receipt of it would have de&s;troyed. On the contrary, John&s;on pre&s;erved it, and placed it in his bureau, in a &s;ituation &s;o obvious, that, whenever he opened that repo&s;itory of his papers, it might look him in the face; and I have not the lea&s;t doubt, that he frequently peru&s;ed and reflected on its contents, and en|deavoured to correct his behaviour by an addre&s;s which he could not but con&s;ider as a friendly admonition.</NOTE>:'&mdash;</Q>but that, immediately recollecting him&s;elf,
<PB N="599" REF="604">
he changed his tone, and mildly &s;aid,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'If I have &s;po|ken roughly to you, impute it to the di&s;traction of my mind, and the petulance of a &s;ick man.'&mdash;</Q>De|&s;cribing his pre&s;ent condition, he &s;aid, that he and his wife were in want of every nece&s;&s;ary, and that neither of them had a change of any one article of raiment.</P>
<P>To be better informed of his circum&s;tances, I vi|&s;ited this per&s;on in the alms-hou&s;e, and was there a witne&s;s to &s;uch a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s as I had never till then beheld. A &s;orry bed, with &s;carce any covering on it, two or three old trunks and boxes, a few broken chairs, and an old table, were all the furniture of the room. I found him &s;moking, and, while I was talking with him, a ragged boy, about ten years of age, came in from the garden, and upon my enquiring who he was, the old man &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'This is a child whom a worthle&s;s father has left on our hands: I took him to keep at four &s;hillings a week, and for four years maintenance have not been able to get more than five pounds four &s;hillings: the poor child is an idiot, he cannot repeat the Lord's Prayer, and is unable to count five: we know not how to di&s;po&s;e of him, and, if we did, we could hardly prevail on
<PB N="600" REF="605">
our&s;elves to part with him; for it is a harmle&s;s, loving creature: we divide our mor&s;el with him, and are ju&s;t able to keep him from &s;tarving.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon enquiring into the means of this poor man's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he informed me, that the endowment of the alms-hou&s;es, in one of which he lived, yielded him an allowance of half a crown a week, and half a chaldron of coals at Chri&s;tmas. That his wife bought milk and &s;old it again, and thereby was able to get about a &s;hilling a day. The &s;cantine&s;s of his income, he &s;aid, had obliged him and his wife to &s;tudy the art of cheap living, and he felicitated him&s;elf that they were become &s;uch proficients therein, as to be able to ab&s;tain from drinking, except at their &s;upper meal, when, as he &s;aid, they each indulged in a pint of beer, which &s;ufficed them for four and twenty hours. He told me all this in a tremulous tone of voice that indicated a mind that had long &s;truggled with affliction, but without the lea&s;t murmur at his hard fortune, or complaint of the doctor's neglect of him: in &s;hort, he appeared to me &s;uch an examplar of meekne&s;s and patience in adver&s;ity, as the be&s;t of men, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, might wi&s;h to imi|tate.</P>
<P>John&s;on had al&s;o a fir&s;t cou&s;in, Elizabeth Herne, a lunatic, whom, upon her di&s;charge from Bethlem ho&s;|pital as incurable, he had placed in a mad-hou&s;e at Bethnal green. A lady of the name of Prow&s;e, had bequeathed to her an annuity of 10l. and John&s;on con&s;tantly paid the bills for her keeping, which, amounting to 25l. a year, made him a benefactor to her of the difference between tho&s;e two &s;ums.</P>
<P><PB N="601" REF="606">
The doctor, by his will, bequeathed to the reverend Mr. Rogers, who had married the daughter of Mrs. Prow&s;e, 100l. towards the maintenance of the lunatic; but he, probably con&s;idering that the intere&s;t of that &s;um would fall far &s;hort of what John&s;on had been u&s;ed to contribute, and that the burthen of &s;upporting her would lie on him&s;elf, renounced the legacy. Had the doctor left her, for her life, the dividends of 500l. part of his &s;tock, &s;he had &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s at his death: as the matter now &s;tands, I mu&s;t apply the 100l. for her maintenance, and, if &s;he lives to exhau&s;t it, mu&s;t &s;eek out the place of her la&s;t legal &s;ettlement, and remit her to the care of a pari&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the craft and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the doctor's negro-&s;ervant, the following is a notable in&s;tance. At the time of his ma&s;ter's death, Mrs. Herne's maintenance was about 30 l. in arrear. I was applied to for the money, and &s;hewed the bill to him, upon which be immediately went to the mad-hou&s;e, and endeavoured to prevail on the keeper thereof to charge it on the legacy; but he refu&s;ed to do it, &s;aying, that the lunatic was placed there by Dr. John|&s;on, and that it was a debt incurred in his life-time, and, by con|&s;equence, was payable out of his effects. When this would not do, this artful fellow came to me, and pretended that he could bring a woman to &s;wear that there was nothing due; and, upon my telling him, that I &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, pay the bill, he &s;aid, he &s;aw there was no good intended for him, and in anger left me.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That the name of the poor man Heely occurs not in the will, and that no better a provi&s;ion is therein made for the lunatic Herne, than a legacy which may fail to &s;upport her through life, can no otherwi&s;e be accounted for, than by the doctor's po&s;tponing that la&s;t &s;olemn act of his life, and his making a di&s;|po&s;ition of what he had to leave, under circum&s;tances that di&s;abled him from recollecting either their rela|tion
<PB N="602" REF="607">
to him, or the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they &s;everally laboured under. Any other &s;uppo&s;ition would be injurious to the memory of a man, who, by his private memo|randa in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, appears to have applied near a fourth part of his income in acts of beneficence.</P>
<P>The above facts are &s;o connected with the tran&s;ac|tions of Dr. John&s;on in the latter days of his life, that they are part of his hi&s;tory; and the mention of them may &s;erve as a caveat again&s;t o&s;tentatious bounty, favour to negroes, and te&s;tamentary di&s;po&s;itions <HI>in extremis.</HI><NOTE N="&dtristar;" PLACE="foot">It will afford &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the compa&s;&s;ionate reader to know, that the means of benefiting Heely, and &s;ome others of Dr. John&s;on's relations, whom he had either totally neglected, or &s;lightly noticed, have been found out and rendered practicable by Mr. Langton. That gentleman, to whom the doctor had given his ma|nu&s;cript Latin poems, having got for them of the book&s;ellers 20l. with that benignity which is but one of his excellent qualities, had determined to divide the &s;ame among the doctor's relations. And whereas the doctor died indebted to the e&s;tate of the late Mr. Beauclerk, in the &s;um of 30l. lady Diana Beauclerk, his relict and executrix, upon the receipt thereof, and being informed of Mr. Langton's intention, in a &s;pirit of true benevolence reque&s;ted, that &s;he might be permitted to add that &s;um to the former, and, accordingly, depo&s;ited it in his hands. Part of this money has been applied in relieving the wants of Heely and his wife, and the re&s;t will be di&s;po&s;ed of among tho&s;e relations that &s;hall appear to &s;tand mo&s;t in need of help; and, as a farther relief to Heely, and for the benefit of the idiot-boy, mea&s;ures are taking to compel the father to maintain him, and eventually to &s;ettle him with the pari&s;h, upon which he has ultimately a legal claim for relief and maintenance.</NOTE></P>
