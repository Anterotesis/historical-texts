<HEAD>THE TRANSLATOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IF the mere diligence of a Tran&s;lator has no claim to repu|tation, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in general we are mode&s;t enough to be contented with another kind of reward. Tran&s;|lation undoubtedly holds the lowe&s;t office in the republic of letters, unle&s;s the compilation of an index &s;hould be reckoned among the labors of the mind. There is nothing enterpri&s;ing in the genius of a tran&s;lator. He trades upon the property of others, without hazarding his own capital, con&s;equently has no extraordinary lo&s;s of credit to fear, or profit to expect. He is no more than the factor of a foreign merchant; and, after having taken abundance of pains to di&s;|po&s;e of commodities that do not belong to him, mu&s;t be &s;atisfied with the honor of having acted faithfully to his employer, and a trifling commi&s;&s;ion. But &s;ince the humility of the office excludes all preten&s;ions to fame, it is to be hoped that it will, in the &s;ame proportion, exempt us from cen&s;ure. If we have no good works of our own to plead, on the other hand we have no original &s;in to an&s;wer for. After this humiliating acknowledgement, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for the Tran&s;lator of the work now offered to the public, to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome rea&s;ons for undertaking an employment which he profe&s;&s;es to undervalue.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">
The great propo&s;ition maintained by the Author of the fol|lowing E&s;&s;ays, that the national debt has been the chief &s;ource of the pre&s;ent wealth and power of Great Britain, though not, as he apprehends, entirely new in this country, had novelty enough however to attract my attention. The book had been favorably received upon the continent, and I under&s;tood that the author was a man of character and reputation in Holland. I was curious to &s;ee in what manner, and with what degree of accuracy, &s;uch a &s;ubject could be treated by a foreigner. Though no great adept in the my&s;tery of finance, I was &s;atisfied that, with regard at lea&s;t to the debts and re&s;ources of England, I mu&s;t know more of the matter than he did. This opinion will not appear very pre&s;umptuous to any man who has had an opportunity of conver&s;ing with foreigners, e&s;pecially the French, upon the internal &s;tate of our affairs, and who knows how ignorant they are in general of a &s;ubject, on which they neverthele&s;s are at all times ready to decide. This, however, I found was not the ca&s;e with the work before me. The author appeared to be a man of abilities, who had taken con&s;iderable pains to be informed. His principal object &s;eems to have been to &s;upport the credit of the Engli&s;h funds again&s;t the prejudices, the ignorance, and the malignity, of the French. At the &s;ame time, though he takes part with England upon this que&s;tion, it is evidently not from partial or intere&s;ted motives, but from a thorough conviction of the truth of his doctrine. In other in&s;tances he is the friend of France. In all in&s;tances he is the friend of mankind. This favorable character is not meant to include the idea of infallible. The &s;y&s;tem he &s;upports may be true in the main, though not logically demon&s;trated; or it may be utterly fal&s;e, though ingeniou&s;ly defended. At any rate, con&s;idering the quantity of foreign property ve&s;ted
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
in our funds, and how much it behoves us to &s;upport the reputation of parliamentary faith, and national &s;ecurity, in the eyes of foreigners, a work of this nature cannot be indifferent to the public. Every argument, that tends to maintain the ju&s;t &s;uperiority of our credit over that of other European nations, particularly of France, de&s;erves to be encouraged; and this is a &s;ubject, on which a foreigner will be more readily believed abroad than an Engli&s;hman. With re&s;pect to the Engli&s;h reader, I will not venture to promi&s;e him much information in matters of fact; but his mind will probably be led to a new train of thought upon a que&s;tion of infinite national importance, and which hitherto &s;eems hardly ever to have been con&s;idered but in one point of view. The decla|mations again&s;t the pernicious effects of the national debt have not been confined to the di&s;cour&s;es of the vulgar, or to the wi&s;dom of the news-papers. Some of the able&s;t men in the kingdom have treated the &s;ubject with as much popular violence and pa&s;&s;ion, as if it would not bear an argument, or as if truth and rea&s;on were unque&s;tionably on <HI>their</HI> &s;ide, and nothing but ignorance and madne&s;s on the other. Even Mr. Hume, from who&s;e genius we might have expected a clear inve&s;tigation and &s;olution of a deep political problem, had done no more than what an ingenious man, with a tolera|ble command of language, but no intimate or comprehen|&s;ive knowledge of the &s;ubject, might have done. He con|&s;tantly takes prejudices for principles, and builds good arguments upon fal&s;e or doubtful data. He does not penetrate, with the eye of a ma&s;ter, into the &s;ub&s;tance of the que&s;tion. He does not even attempt to reconcile the phaenomena with the rea&s;oning; nor does he tell us by what deviation of fact from argument we are at this moment a nation. This is
<PB N="iv" REF="6">
the common defect of almo&s;t all our writers upon the national debt; and if Mr. Hume be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t, it is not by any marks of that deep intuitive perception, with which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him&s;elf of almo&s;t every other &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In order to &s;upport a doctrine, very different from that which has hitherto prevailed among us, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to affirm, that <HI>all</HI> the principles a&s;&s;umed by tho&s;e writers are fal&s;e, or that <HI>all</HI> their arguments are ab&s;urd. In human &s;pe|culations the &s;ources of truth and fal&s;ehood lie &s;o near each other, that the &s;treams &s;oon meet, and are too often confounded together beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;eparation. The majority of mankind drink deep of the mixture, without enquiry or reflection. The philo&s;opher endeavours to carry his enquiries upward, to a&s;cend the great &s;tream, until he reaches the point of conflux, at which truth and fal&s;ehood meet and are united.</P>
<P>The doctrine maintained in the following E&s;&s;ay on Credit and Circulation may, in its turn, be liable to the objection of being pu&s;hed too far; but it is a doctrine that carries con&s;olation and encouragement along with it. Truth is u&s;ually found to mediate between the extremes. The object of the Tran&s;lator is, to contribute &s;omething to a collection of materials, out of which a wi&s;er and a more methodical head may hereafter form &s;ome rational &s;y&s;tem of finance. There is no branch of knowledge more nece&s;&s;ary, nor, I believe, le&s;s cultivated in this country. The &s;peculative part of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, in&s;tead of running into vehement declamations again&s;t evils either real or imaginary, &s;hould, above all things, endeavour to account for facts and appearances, which are manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with the rea&s;on|ing of former financiers, and which directly give the lye to their determinate and uniform predictions. Until this be done, the
<PB N="v" REF="7">
mind may be alarmed with difficulties, or puzzled with argu|ment; but it never can be &s;atisfied. The practical part of the &s;y&s;tem &s;hould propo&s;e nothing but what the projector him&s;elf, if he were in the mini&s;ter's place, would, bon&acirc; fide, carry into execution. The circum&s;tances of the nation will not admit of hazardous experiments; and a good citizen &s;hould remember, that, when he propo&s;es a plau&s;ible &s;cheme for the public &s;ervice, unle&s;s it be, at the &s;ame time, and all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, a practicable one, he does an e&s;&s;ential mi&s;chief to &s;ociety. He fir&s;t of all aggravates the evil, in order to attribute the greater merit to the remedy; he exa&s;perates the minds of the ignorant, who think their ca&s;e de&s;perate, and are ready to &s;wallow any thing; and he alienates the affections of the people from government, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have remedies within their reach, which they neglect to make u&s;e of. All this has more than once been done by very hone&s;t and well-meaning per&s;ons. In England a good and wi&s;e man will be very cautious of appealing with argu|ment to the pa&s;&s;ions of the people. The Engli&s;h are a moody, re&s;tle&s;s, gloomy people; and, whether right or wrong, they all argue. Whenever they are taught to think that their e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts are in que&s;tion, it requires but a moderate portion of party eloquence to rou&s;e them into frenzy, or to &s;ink them into de&s;pair. Their con&s;titutional impatience mingles with their opinions. They &s;ee every political object in the wor&s;t point of view, and feel a &s;trange gratification in the melancholy pa|trioti&s;m of deploring the ruin of their country. To the indul|gence of this di&s;po&s;ition no object could be better accommo|dated, than the enormity of the national debt, and the horrible train of evils that are &s;uppo&s;ed to attend it. This is a &s;tanding di&s;h, on which an Engli&s;hman may fea&s;t his imagination, when he has no particular di&s;tre&s;s or injury to con&s;ole him. In the
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
following E&s;&s;ay he will &s;ee his favorite grievance very much reduced, both in &s;ize and quality. But will he thank the Author, or the Tran&s;lator, for the pains they have taken to undeceive him? At the &s;ame time we do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay that the magnitude of the debt furni&s;hes no ground what&s;oever for appre|hen&s;ion; but we affirm, that the dangerous quality of it has been extravagantly over-rated, and that it is accompanied with circum&s;tances of benefit, for which no adequate allowance has been made. Ever &s;ince this &s;welling &s;tream began to flow, a uniform fa&s;hion has de&s;cended with it of annexing no ideas to &s;uch an object, but tho&s;e of torrent and de&s;olation. The people of this country, with the in&s;tance before their eyes, have hardly ever con&s;idered that there is a &s;ort of inundation, that carries riches and fertility, as well as terror, along with it. But we are not afraid to encounter any kind of &s;peculation, let it be ever &s;o univer&s;ally adopted, that &s;tands in perpetual oppo&s;ition to ex|perience. We think it will appear, upon a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquiry, not only that we &s;hould not have been &s;o powerful a nation, but that we &s;hould not have been &s;o rich as we are, if we had not run in debt; and that our object &s;hould be, not to pay off the debt, but to reduce and keep it within &s;uch bounds, as may leave us an ample margin of credit for future exigences. In &s;pite of all declamations, the hi&s;torical fact is not to be re&s;i&s;ted. The wealth and power of the Engli&s;h nation have grown with its debt; and without being bound to prove that they &s;tand in the &s;trict relation of cau&s;e and effect, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ilence mo&s;t of our opponents, that the two accidents have gone hand in hand together, and in general pre&s;erved their original proportion to each other. It cannot be denied, that the rate of intere&s;t is lower by one half at lea&s;t, if not five eighths, than it was before any public debt exi&s;ted, and that the value of land has ri&s;en &s;ince
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
that period in nearly the &s;ame proportion. A man mu&s;t be blinded not to &s;ee, and merely ob&s;tinate not to admit, that the general increa&s;e of the national &s;tock, in every article of property and improvement, has kept pace with the increa&s;e of the debt; and what is &s;till more extraordinary, though not le&s;s true, that when we owed above a hundred millions &s;terling, we were able to borrow &s;ums, which not only could not have been borrowed, but which could not have been found, at the time when we owed nothing. To tho&s;e who will not be per&s;uaded of the truth of a principle &s;upported by &s;uch a concurrence of unque&s;|tionable facts, the argument mu&s;t be offered in another &s;hape. Admitting the debt to be a national evil of any &s;uppo&s;ed mag|nitude, let it not be exaggerated beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of relief. If it be a burthen, let us flatter our&s;elves that we &s;till have &s;trength enough left to lighten or remove it. The contrary opinion leads directly to inactivity and de&s;pondence. No man &s;ets heartily about a ta&s;k, which he thinks he &s;hall never be able to accompli&s;h. If, in&s;tead of indulging in the peevi&s;h plea&s;ure of complaining, or in the childi&s;h imbecillity of mag|nifying the object of our fears, the nation could be brought to a more chearful temper on this &s;ubject, the mini&s;ter would be quickened and encouraged by it to meet this formidable debt in front, and to attack it fairly by &s;ome vigorous and &s;pirited ope|ration. On their own principles, they ought not only to applaud him when his &s;chemes &s;ucceed, but endeavour to animate and con&s;ole him when they fail. Surrounded, as they &s;uppo&s;e him to be, with dangers and terrors of every &s;ort, they ought to meet him after a defeat, and return him their thanks for not de&s;pairing of the republic.</P>
<P>But in this, as in every other deliberation that touches the &s;afety of the commonwealth, it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
with caution between vigor and violence, and not to conceive our &s;ituation to be &s;o far hopele&s;s, as to admit of none but de&s;perate remedies. A &s;trong man &s;hows his &s;trength in actions that require but a moderate exertion of it. The weak man, on the contrary, betrays his feeblene&s;s by the violence of his efforts, and by the &s;ame means u&s;ually ha&s;tens the ruin of a broken or enervated con&s;titution.</P>
<P>When we &s;peak of violent mea&s;ures applied to the reduction of the debt, we are far from meaning any &s;uch as carry the idea of force, or breach of &s;pecific contract with the public creditor. We are equally convinced, that a Briti&s;h parliament will never entertain a thought of that kind, and that the nation would never adopt it. The caution is directed merely again&s;t what are com|monly called Strokes in Finance, intended to operate &s;uddenly to a great extent. The mea&s;ures, that really de&s;erve that name, are &s;low and gradual, but &s;ure in their operation, and con&s;tantly increa&s;ing in their power. They are al&s;o &s;afe in this re&s;pect, that they do not &s;uddenly alter the &s;tate and di&s;po&s;ition of any con&s;iderable ma&s;s of property at once, or throw it out of the ordinary channels of circulation. In the cour&s;e of the following work, the reader will meet with hints leading to mea&s;ures of this nature, which may be adopted, or improved, by men better &s;killed in the finances of England than either the author or the tran&s;lator.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the merit of the tran&s;lation now &s;ubmitted to the public, or however defective or incomplete the original may appear to readers thoroughly ver&s;ed in the &s;ubject, the Author him&s;elf has a powerful claim upon the Engli&s;h reader, and &s;hould be received among us with every po&s;&s;ible mark of per&s;onal con&s;ideration and re&s;pect. The &s;ervices which Mon&s;ieur de Pinto has rendered to the Engli&s;h nation cannot ea&s;ily be over|rated.
<PB N="ix" REF="11">
He has &s;upported the credit of the funds, and a&s;&s;erted the power and re&s;ources of this country, again&s;t two of the mo&s;t dangerous enemies that genius and argument can po&s;&s;ibly contend with&mdash;the malignity of the French, and the ignorance of the re&s;t of Europe. He has done it with a zeal, &s;pirit, ability, and &s;ucce&s;s, that entitle him to our utmo&s;t gratitude and favor. Such advocates, in defence of our national credit, are more wanted, and more u&s;eful, upon the continent, than people in this country are commonly aware of. They help to di&s;&s;uade &s;ome from withdrawing their property out of the funds; they incite others to ve&s;t it in them; and they contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h a favorable opinion, in the councils of other powers, of the extent and &s;uperiority of our re&s;ources, as nece&s;&s;ary perhaps to &s;ecure us from in&s;ult or attack, as the mo&s;t formidable or menacing apparatus of war. The increa&s;e of foreign property in the funds is an object, which intere&s;ts the nation in propor|tion to the &s;um total of the debt. The actual quantity of this commodity far exceeds our home con&s;umption; and it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mpo&s;&s;ible to keep it at any tolerable price, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a foreign market. I am not moved by the objection of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nnuity carried out of the nation, becau&s;e I am convinced that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f we are thrifty, we may gain more by the u&s;e than we lo&s;e by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he intere&s;t. Would to God that the whole debt could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mmediately purcha&s;ed by, and transferred to, foreigners! What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tronger guaranty could we po&s;&s;ibly invent for pre&s;erving our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">dependence as a nation, and for the &s;ecurity of the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tabli&s;hment?

His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eal de&s;erves to be honored and encouraged;&mdash;his works de&s;erve

to be read. The&s;e are not however the only obligations, for which we are indebted to Mon&s;ieur de Pinto.</P>
<P>A mi&s;take in that article of the preliminaries of the la&s;t treaty with France, which relates to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the two Ea&s;t-India companies, was fortunately ob&s;erved by Mon&s;ieur de Pinto, and communicated to the late Duke of Bedford. This anecdote is highly honorable to the Duke's memory. He &s;aw, and acknowledged the importance of Mon&s;ieur de Pinto's ob&s;er|vation, and, with a &s;pirit infinitely more honorable to him than any diligence that might have prevented the mi&s;take, he in&s;i&s;ted peremptorily upon its being corrected in the definitive treaty. The French mini&s;ter &s;hrugged his &s;houlders, re&s;i&s;ted, cavilled, remon&s;trated, complained, grimaced, and &s;ubmitted. Mon&s;ieur de Pinto's &s;ervices on this important occa&s;ion were recommended by the Duke, and rewarded by the Company. They gave him five hundred pounds a year, which he now enjoys, and which, it is to be pre&s;umed, their gratitude and ju&s;tice will always continue to him.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Notes, after reviewing them deliberately in print, I feel an hone&s;t inclination to confe&s;s, that they appear to me to be written with much greater freedom than judgment. They are exempt however from the principal error of com|mentators, who are apt to run into extravagant and indi&s;crimi|nate prai&s;es of their original. With re&s;pect to the length of the Notes, a man mu&s;t have dealt in the my&s;tery of comment and annotation, to know how difficult it is to exerci&s;e it with brevity, and how much more difficult it is to refrain from printing what has once been written. We authors have a fal&s;e parental tenderne&s;s about us, which induces us to expo&s;e our offspring, when perhaps it would be more to our credit, and a much greater act of mercy, to &s;trangle them in their birth. I
<PB N="xi" REF="13">
am thoroughly &s;en&s;ible that the little I have ventured of my own has no chance of being well received, but under the au&s;pices of the text.</P>
<P>I had at fir&s;t &s;ome thoughts of &s;oliciting the Mini&s;ter's leave to offer the whole work to his protection. An e&s;&s;ay upon finance &s;eemed to fall within his department, though I had no expectation of his honoring it with a peru&s;al. A mini&s;ter is too much employed in reading men to find lei&s;ure for reading books. Yet the &s;anction of his name might have recommended it to others. On farther con&s;ideration however, that idea was given up. Be&s;ides that I had no &s;ufficient intere&s;t or intro|duction to obtain &s;uch a favor, I was unwilling that my own &s;peculations, &s;uch as they are, &s;hould be cramped or qua|lified by the temporary intere&s;ts or engagements of govern|ment, or accommodated to the immediate views of men in office. My ideas of &s;erving the public go beyond the opening of a budget, or the &s;ervice of a year. Perhaps I could not give the reader a more &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urance, that they will never be adopted.</P>

<HEAD>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of this E&s;&s;ay was written in France in the year 1761. I thought it nece&s;&s;ary therefore to enter into a detail of various particulars re&s;pecting the Eng|li&s;h funds, with which the French were unacquainted. Several per&s;ons took copies of it at Paris. Some Engli&s;h noblemen, whom I &s;aw there after the peace, did me the &s;ame honor. It &s;eems probable, that this E&s;&s;ay will one day or other be printed; and I &s;hould have rea&s;on to apprehend its appearing in a very imperfect &s;tate. As it was not drawn up with a view to publication, the proofs, by which many new pro|po&s;itions were &s;upported, were not carried to that extent, nor to that degree of illu&s;tration, which the &s;ubject &s;eemed to require. I have even ob&s;erved lately in &s;ome Engli&s;h papers, that my ideas began to be received in England; and, con&s;idering the number of manu&s;cript copies that have been taken within the&s;e three years, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed at it. Some well-informed Engli&s;hmen told me at Paris, that my &s;y&s;tem, &s;o far as it concerns the national debt, was entirely new.</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>An E&s;&s;ay on the Con&s;titution of England, publi&s;hed in the year 1765.&mdash;The author &s;ays, that the very ob&s;tructions and difficulties, which King William met with in obtaining &s;upplies from parliament, were the means of rai&s;ing the nation to a degree of glory unknown to former ages. He explains this a&s;&s;ertion by ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that before the reign of King William no method was known of rai&s;ing money for the exigencies of the year, except that of levying equivalent taxes or impo|&s;itions; which, when great, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen in times of war, were much felt and complained of by the people in general, without any part of them being gainers by the public lo&s;s; &s;o that, although a foreign war was often made a pretence by former kings and mini&s;ters in order to obtain a &s;um of money, there was nothing in reality they more dreaded. But now a method was happily devi&s;ed of abundantly &s;upplying the crown without burthening the people, by means of voluntary contributions of tho&s;e who were eager to contri|bute any &s;ums of money, in con&s;ideration of &s;even or eight per cent. while the good people of England were kept ea&s;y, by having no more taxes impo&s;ed on them than were barely &s;ufficient to pay the annual intere&s;t of the &s;ums &s;o advanced.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As this method was tried at fir&s;t with caution, both by tho&s;e who borrowed and tho&s;e who lent the money, the good effects of it were little felt during the reign of King William; who lived to the la&s;t in a factious and tottering &s;tate; but from the fir&s;t di&s;covery of this &s;cheme of anticipation we may date that great change in the con&s;titution, which has brought Great-Britain to that height of power, to which it is &s;ince arrived. From that moment the ability of England for carrying on foreign war began to manife&s;t it&s;elf, fir&s;t in unprofitable &s;quab|bles about what is called the Balance of Europe; but afterwards in u&s;eful con|que&s;ts on her own account in all quarters of the globe. From that moment the con&s;titution of England began to be actuated by a &s;pirit &s;omewhat &s;imilar to that which actuated the con&s;titution of ancient Rome, where a foreign war never failed to &s;top the mouths of the &s;editious, and to put an end to dome&s;tic broils. War in England became advantageous to almo&s;t every rank of men. The poor wi&s;hed for it, as the greater demand for laborers increa&s;ed the price of labor. The rich wi&s;hed for it, as the greater the demand for money, the greater the advantage to tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; while tho&s;e in the admini&s;tration of government were ea&s;ily per&s;uaded into a mea&s;ure, which, with &s;uch univer&s;al approbation, puts &s;uch unlimited power into their hands.

<P>There is much truth in the&s;e arguments; yet, in the deduction of con&s;equences, a lively imagination may be mi&s;led by them.

King William met with in obtaining &s;upplies from parliament, has been the cau&s;e of the opulence of the kingdom. The contradictions he received from the nation obliged him to introduce the Dutch &s;y&s;tem of loans into England, and the kingdom has been enriched by it. In this &s;troke I di&s;co|vered the adoption of my own principles. On reading the pamphlet, I &s;aw that the author had not proved his &s;y&s;tem by the &s;ame kind of arguments I have done. In the year
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
1761 my E&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject was read by every body at Paris. Some ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages were pointed out to me, which ea&s;ily e&s;cape a writer, who, full of his &s;ubject, &s;uppo&s;es every thing as clear and intelligible to the reader as to him&s;elf. The&s;e I have endeavoured to correct; and I flatter my&s;elf, that the principles, on which my &s;y&s;tem is founded, are now proved to demon&s;tration. The conclu&s;ions re&s;ulting from them are not barren truths, nor merely of &s;peculation. They are equally intere&s;ting to the public, and to the principal powers of Europe.</P>
<P>I may venture to affirm, that during my &s;tay at Paris, I removed a prejudice which many people had conceived again&s;t the credit of England. They imagined, that the Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had no re&s;ource left; and flattered them&s;elves they &s;hould every minute &s;ee a national bankruptcy, which would overturn the kingdom. I proved that this was all a delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h in general are little acquainted with the immen&s;e re&s;ources of France. The French are totally igno|rant of tho&s;e of England. The two nations are formed to e&s;teem each other, and to live in peace; yet, unfortunately, they quarrel about &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;ts, which at the bottom perhaps are mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y of commerce, and competition for power, create enmity between nations as well as between individuals. They run the &s;ame career, and a&s;piring at the &s;ame object, are enemies becau&s;e they are rivals. If princes could be per|&s;uaded, that the real intere&s;ts of commercial powers do not cla&s;h (as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how hereafter) peace and the happine&s;s of mankind might po&s;&s;ibly be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a durable foundation.</P>

The reader &s;hould be appri&s;ed, that this Sy&s;tem of Credit and Circulation will require reading deliberately, and oftener than once. The &s;ubject is of an ab&s;tract nature. In the fir&s;t reading, &s;ome things, e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to make the &s;y&s;tem intelligible, will always e&s;cape. In the progre&s;s, and at the end of a di&s;cour&s;e, we often find proofs which con|firm and explain the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertions; and &s;ometimes it is impo&s;&s;ible to comprehend the truth of the la&s;t propo&s;itions, if the fir&s;t are not thoroughly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It has been frequently ob&s;erved, that to li&s;ten well is more difficult than to &s;peak well; at lea&s;t it is certain, that there are many who &s;peak &s;en&s;ibly, for one who li&s;tens with atten|tion. We hear with di&s;traction and prejudice, and in general are more employed in framing a reply, than in con&s;idering what has been &s;aid. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with the gene|rality of readers. Inattention in reading is oftentimes un|avoidable; but it may ea&s;ily be repaired by a &s;econd or third peru&s;al, particularly of the e&s;&s;ential articles. The&s;e are &s;hort, and contain truths of importance. Impatience and vivacity are apt to prejudice the reader again&s;t a new propo&s;ition. A croud of objections pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his mind.

<P>They, who are not intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject, have no bu&s;i|ne&s;s to read an e&s;&s;ay not written for their u&s;e. They, who take a real intere&s;t in it, will read it oftener than once; and, I hope, with attention.

how much greater is the indulgence due to a writer who pretends to nothing but to deliver &s;ome important truths in a new form! With regard to &s;tyle, I have attended only to things, not to words.</P>
<P>Inveterate prejudices were to be removed. I frequently ap|pear to di&s;pute truths, which in fact I admit, but which, from being improperly applied, have led to dangerous mi&s;takes. I often &s;eem to repeat what others have &s;aid, when in effect the difference between us is material. Truth, in the ab&s;tract, is indivi&s;ible, &s;imple, and unalterable. No one truth is greater than another. But it is not &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the infinite relations, which different truths bear to each other. This I believe is the principal &s;ource of our mi&s;takes, every man thinking that the truth he &s;et out with continues to &s;upport him.</P>
<P>Repetitions will, I hope, be forgiven. They are &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, and always u&s;eful. They revive and illu&s;trate fun|damental truths. They are not &s;o much repetitions, as con|clu&s;ions, of which the reader &s;hould from time to time be reminded. Some ideas mu&s;t be cut into facets to be thoroughly under&s;tood. If in &s;ome places I a&s;&s;ume a figurative &s;tyle, it is at lea&s;t without affectation. Every opportunity &s;hould be taken to adorn a &s;ubject naturally dry and barren of ornament, pro|vided the figures are not too far fetched. When the &s;oil is unfruitful, we are glad to meet with flowers.</P>
<P>Some remarks, which would have made the text too diffu&s;ed, and perplexed the tran&s;itions, are mentioned in notes.</P>
<P>The means, pointed out in the Second Part, for con&s;olidating the &s;inking fund in England, and creating another auxiliary and permanent &s;inking fund, applicable to the di&s;charge of debt both in peace and war, are only loo&s;e ideas.

In &s;ome places I refute Mr. Hume, who, far from taking it ami&s;s, has favored me with many marks of friend&s;hip and affection, and I feel a pride in acknowledging my gratitude to him. We both aim at the &s;ame object. Our com|mon view is to &s;erve the public. This is not a trial of under|&s;tanding.

<HEAD>ESSAY ON CIRCULATION AND CREDIT.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART 1. <HI>The great Advantages of the National Debt, to a certain Amount. How the Commerce or Gaming in the Stocks contributes to the Credit and Circulation of the Public Funds; and what Advan|tages</HI> England <HI>has derived from thence.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE national debt of England, and the funds that com|po&s;e it, known under the name of Annuities, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The annuities in England are of a different nature from tho&s;e in France, though under the &s;ame denomination. Tho&s;e of France are extingui&s;hed in a few years by a reimbur&s;ement of part of the principal, which every year accompanies the payment of the intere&s;t; whereas, in tho&s;e of England, nothing is provided for but the intere&s;t: the reimbur&s;ement of the debt depends upon the plea&s;ure of government: the principal can never be demanded. On the other hand, the intere&s;t can never be reduced without offering to repay the principal. For this rea&s;on, in the late loans, the lenders, at the beginning of the war, demanded of government an intere&s;t of three and a half per cent. for a certain number of years: that is, that government &s;hould not offer to repay the principal before a &s;tipulated term; at the end of which tho&s;e annuities &s;hould &s;tand reduced to three per cent. and government be at liberty to di&s;charge them. It is proper to ob&s;erve that all the annuities, created before the la&s;t war, were reduced, in the year 1750, to three per cent. an offer being made to pay off tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to the reduction; and that there are no annuities at three and a half and four per cent. but the loans made &s;ince the year 1755, and the&s;e only for a certain number of years. Let us admire the effect of credit. The lenders make it part of their bargain not to be paid off for a long time; they in&s;i&s;t upon having time to enjoy an intere&s;t of three and a half and four per cent. which they think might be redeemed by the &s;tate, and con&s;equently be reduced in time of peace. It mu&s;t al&s;o be ob&s;erved that, although annuities are not <HI>actions,</HI> the whole commerce, carried on in the funds, pa&s;&s;es under the general name of Stockjobbing, or <HI>Jeu d' Actions.</HI> <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>On this note of the author it is to be ob&s;erved, that in Queen Anne's time various duties were granted by different acts of parliament, for e&s;tabli&s;hing funds to pay off the principal and intere&s;t of particular loans within a given number of years. Since the produce of all the&s;e &s;eparate funds was united by the Aggregate Act, they became mutual &s;ecurities for each other; and the &s;urplus upon the whole, after paying the annuities charged upon each di&s;tinct fund, is carried to the &s;inking fund, which, being benefited by all &s;urplu&s;es, &s;tands as a collateral &s;ecurity for all deficiencies. But although it has been found convenient to depart from the old mode of a&s;&s;igning &s;eparate &s;ecurities for &s;eparate loans, and applying the &s;ur|plus of each fund to the di&s;charge of the principal, it is equally the mini&s;ter's duty to take care that the tax or fund, appropriated to pay the intere&s;t of every new loan, &s;hall produce a &s;urplus in &s;ome degree proportioned to the ma&s;s of new debt con|tracted, and which may be carried to the improvement of the &s;inking fund. As long as this principle is, or can be, firmly adhered to in practice, public credit will &s;upport it&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding the increa&s;ed ma&s;s of the debt; becau&s;e the creditor will &s;ee that the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing does not exceed the means of repaying; at lea&s;t, that the two objects are equally in the contemplation of parlia|ment. On the contrary, the &s;ure&s;t way to de&s;troy public credit is to depart from this principle; that is, to a&s;&s;ign funds who&s;e produce falls &s;hort of the charge they are intended to &s;upport; in con&s;equence of which the &s;inking fund not only receives no improvement, but is obliged to make good a deficiency. This fund is given as a &s;ecurity to the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> creditor. A new creditor has no right to be bene|fited by it, unle&s;s the fund, created with the loan, produces a &s;urplus that &s;hall bear the &s;ame proportion to the new debt, which the pre&s;ent &s;inking fund does to the pre&s;ent debt. Credit depends upon opinion; and what is &s;o likely to lower the general opinion of the good faith or means of government, as to &s;ee that taxes do not produce what they are given for? and that con&s;equently a &s;ecurity, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be con&s;ined to a certain quantum of debt, is, in effect, from year to year extended, to make good new engagements? The former creditor in the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;uffers an inju&s;tice, of which government in its turn will &s;oon feel the bad effect.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of public credit is much altered &s;ince the year 1733, when the public creditor dreaded nothing more than to be obliged to receive his money from the &s;inking fund. At that period the moneyed men and public companies were under a kind of &s;ubjection to government.</P>
<P>But the author is mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the bargain made by the lender, in &s;ome of the late loans at three and a half and four per cent. not to be paid off within a certain number of years, was an admirable effect of credit. It was the increa&s;e of intere&s;t that induced the creditor to in&s;i&s;t upon this unrea&s;onable condi|tion; and it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure the failure of credit, ari&s;ing from the enormous expences of the war, that obliged government to comply with it. The author does not &s;eem to be aware, that there are various degrees of public credit between that &s;tate, at which government &s;ecurities are at or above par, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of borrowing on any terms what&s;oever. A man who can borrow a hundred pounds at three per cent. has undoubtedly a better credit than he who cannot borrow under four, although they equally contract a debt of one hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the increa&s;e of intere&s;t from three to three and a half and four per cent&punc; government was obliged to give con&s;iderable douceurs to the &s;ub&s;cribers to every new loan in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t war. By the&s;e means the nominal rate of intere&s;t was kept down; but, if the value of the&s;e douceurs were computed, it would appear, perhaps, that government in many ca&s;es gave an advantage to the lender, equal to five or &s;ix per cent. upon the money borrowed.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE><HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></P></NOTE> have for &s;ome time attracted the attention of princes, and the &s;peculation of individuals.

Be&s;ides this, there are things which can never be well under&s;tood in theory. Practice alone gives us a thorough in&s;ight into affairs. To know all the windings of the &s;era|glio, one mu&s;t be educated within-&s;ide of it. Yet, if I can engage the reader's attention, I hope to &s;peak plainly enough to make my&s;elf under&s;tood. I my&s;elf have been &s;urpri&s;ed at the detail which this object requires, and how ab&s;tracted it &s;eems even to &s;ome who have been accu&s;tomed to &s;tudies infinitely more &s;o.

Another difficulty ari&s;es from the terms appropriated to this traffic: &s;ome of them are unknown; others mu&s;t be taken in an acceptation different from the vulgar &s;en&s;e; and this circum&s;tance requires particular attention. The draught of this picture has engaged me in a di&s;&s;ertation upon credit and circulation, more important than the traffic of the &s;tocks. It will flatter me, if they, who &s;earch for information upon &s;o important a &s;ubject, &s;hould find it in this paper; and if my ideas of circulation and credit in general &s;hould be of any &s;ervice to the public. I may be deceived; but it is not my intention to mi&s;lead. With re&s;pect to facts, I cannot be mi&s;taken, becau&s;e I advance none which are not certain, and almo&s;t of public notoriety.</P>

our wants are &s;upplied. The real circulation of money, in the daily and dome&s;tic expence, which we call Bu&s;ine&s;s, is prodi|gious. The &s;ame crown piece may have circulated through fifty different hands in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, and repre|&s;ented fifty different things in the cour&s;e of its circulation. If the fifty per&s;ons were to meet at night, they would find, that they had expended and paid fifty crowns, though <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Take the following example:&mdash;Paul, on Monday morning, pays a crown to his baker; the baker buys a crown's worth of faggots; the &s;eller pays a crown which he owed at the tavern; the tavern-keeper gives it to his wife, who buys a fan; the fan-maker pays for &s;omething el&s;e with the &s;ame crown; and it is po&s;&s;ible that at night it may return to Paul, who wins it at Quinze, and &s;o on. <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">This example proves nothing in favour of circulation. The operation would have been more &s;imple, and equally effectual, if the &s;uttlers, in&s;tead of lending the &s;ame &s;um every week &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, had given a continued credit to the garri&s;on for every article they were &s;upplied with during the &s;even weeks &s;iege: but in this ca&s;e the accounts between the pay-ma&s;ter and the army could not have been regularly kept; the garri&s;on could not have been regularly paid; and, what is more material, the &s;oldier would have been deprived of the apparent liberty of laying out his money with the &s;uttler, or not, as he thought proper. So powerful is the effect of habit, that all our ideas of value refer to the &s;igns of it.

At la&s;t it was re&s;olved to borrow 7000 florins from the &s;uttlers, which was all they had. At the end of the week the&s;e 7000 florins had returned to the &s;uttlers, from whom the &s;ame &s;um was borrowed a &s;econd time: this operation was repeated for &s;even weeks, until the &s;urrender of the place; &s;o that the &s;ame 7000 florins performed the office of 49,000.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> in fact there had exi&s;ted but one piece of money.

<P>This minute circulation is immen&s;e, from the multiplicity of &s;imultaneous operations repeated in all quarters, and at every minute. But there is another circulation in gro&s;s, &s;upported by credit and paper &s;ecurity, which repre&s;ents money, as money repre&s;ents things. The example of the crown piece &s;hows, that a private merchant, <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid that Sir Samuel Fludyer, who was factor to mo&s;t of the great clothiers, u&s;ed to &s;end them their balance in his own notes in&s;tead of money, which circulated in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, and the parts adjacent, for two, three, or four years, without returning to him to be liquidated in bank bills or &s;pecie.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> who&s;e credit is good, inde|pendently of the re&s;pite allowed him for the payment of his purcha&s;es, may circulate his own paper, avail him&s;elf of that of others, and multiply the &s;prings of his commerce in proportion to the facility of circulation.

My Lord Bolingbroke, and the Pre&s;ident de Monte&s;quieu, have con&s;idered annuitants, whom they &s;uppo&s;ed to live in idlene&s;s upon the funds, at the expence of the indu&s;trious part of the people, as &s;o many hurt|ful members to the &s;tate, which, already overwhelmed by the facility of running into debt, is weakened and enervated by &s;up|porting its creditors.</P>
<P>Whatever truth there may be in &s;uch reflexions, I &s;hall demon&s;trate that great advantages have re&s;ulted from the crea|tion of loans, and even from the traffic or game carried on in the funds, when once the nature of it is under&s;tood, and the whole &s;ubject, combined with all its con&s;equences, &s;hall be thoroughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The loo&s;e and imperfect ideas, which &s;ome per&s;ons have conceived on this point, have given ri&s;e to a number of works, in which the authors have mi&s;taken the nature, circulation, and credit of the Engli&s;h funds, and have done a di&s;&s;ervice to France, by leading her into an error upon a mo&s;t important article. People have been too ready to believe what they ardently wi&s;hed might be true. When once we &s;et out upon a fal&s;e principle, the whole &s;y&s;tem is affected by it.</P>
<P>Who is there that might not be &s;educed at finding it advanced as a certain fact, in a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks upon the Advantages and Di&s;advantages of Great Britain and France.</NOTE> book much e&s;teemed and very well written, that the Bank of England unites within it&s;elf, as in a &s;ingle point, all the public credit of the nation and all the

private credit of individuals? The <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">It is true, that immediately the Bank of England has no other connexion with the national debt, than that which a great creditor has with his debtor; and yet it may be que&s;tioned, whether the failure of the Bank would not be almo&s;t as fatal in its con&s;equences as a general bankruptcy; or whether either of tho&s;e events would not nece&s;&s;arily produce the other: if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate, and indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to choo&s;e between them, the great que&s;tion would not turn upon the quantity of fictitious property, that would be annihilated in either ca&s;e, or on the number of individuals ruined; but whether it would be &s;afer to annihilate the active, or the inactive, ma&s;s of property. It is the credit of the Bank, that in a great mea&s;ure gives circulation to the funds. But the&s;e are dangerous or u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculations: a wi&s;e man will not &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, again&s;t which no human wi&s;dom can provide a remedy. That the Bank unites within it&s;elf the whole credit of individuals, is not &s;o unwarrantable a propo&s;ition as the author &s;eems to appre|hend: he is not, perhaps, acquainted with the detail of expedients by which mer|cantile credit has for a long time been &s;upported in this country. The profits of the Bank, by di&s;counting private notes, mu&s;t be immen&s;e. A merchant or trade&s;|man, who&s;e notes they refu&s;e, is not very far from bankruptcy: their honor and ju&s;tice in the application of this formidable power has never been que&s;tioned. Whenever they have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to lay any general check upon di&s;count|ing, it has always been attended with a proportionate &s;tagnation of trade and private credit.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> Bank of England has nothing to do with the national debt: it is a bank of circulation, which bears no other relation to government, than a rich indi|vidual bears to the &s;tate. A Mount of Piety, a Lombard well e&s;tabli&s;hed, might perhaps, in time and under a good direc|tion, do very near as much in France as the Bank does in England.</P>
<P>Government is &s;o far from con&s;idering the Bank, that, at the beginning of the la&s;t war, they did entirely without its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Exchequer bills performed the office of the Bank. The terms, in which the author exaggerates the alarm and di&s;tre&s;s of the Bank in the year 1745, are no better founded.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="29">
<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The&s;e ideas of the author, with re&s;pect to public credit, do not appear to me &s;trictly correct. The &s;tate of credit is not to be mea&s;ured by the &s;ums that may be borrowed, but by the terms on which they may be borrowed. A great nation can hardly be reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of di&s;credit, as not to be able to rai&s;e money by offering exorbitant advantages. In this ca&s;e the lender proportions his terms to the apparent weakne&s;s of the &s;ecurity or di&s;tre&s;s of the borrower. When France was already overwhelmed with debt, and every po&s;&s;ible re&s;ource of finance &s;eemed to be exhau&s;ted, Lewis XIV. &s;till found means to rai&s;e eight millions of livres in &s;pecie, for which he was obliged to charge his revenue with a debt of thirty-two millions. Between borrowing on &s;uch terms, and not being able to borrow at all, the difference is not very con&s;iderable. A new loan in England naturally tends to lower the value or price of the old funds, for two rea&s;ons. Fir&s;t, the general increa&s;e of the ma&s;s le&s;&s;ens the general value of the com|modity. Secondly, the advantageous terms offered by government draws into the new &s;ub&s;cription that money, which would have been inve&s;ted in the old funds. The author's &s;uppo&s;ition, that the proprietors of the old funds would find their account in &s;elling out, in order to purcha&s;e into the new &s;ub&s;cription, does not operate, I believe, &s;o generally as he apprehends. The terms of every new &s;ub&s;cription are regulated by the current price of the three per cents. If, for example, the three per cents. are at &s;eventy-five, government mu&s;t give four per cent. to be upon a par with the old &s;tocks. But a mere equality will not tempt any man to alter the &s;ituation of his property. A con&s;iderable douceur mu&s;t be added, not only &s;ufficient to indemnify the lender again&s;t a fall in the price of his &s;tock, which he propo&s;es to &s;ell, but to reward him for the ri&s;que he runs of not being able to di&s;po&s;e of his &s;hare in the new &s;ub&s;cription to advantage. Now this is all matter of &s;peculation, in which either the advantage is not clear and certain, con&s;equently not likely to tempt the holder of the three per cents. to &s;ell at a low price; or, if it be clear and certain, it will of cour&s;e draw all the money in the market immediately into the new &s;ub&s;cription. Admitting it then to be advan|tageous to the holder of the three per cent. annuities to &s;ell out, and &s;ub&s;cribe to the new loan, where is he to find a purcha&s;er? The moneyed man knows his intere&s;t too well to place him&s;elf in a &s;ituation which the other thinks it advi&s;eable to quit. It is <HI>he,</HI> on the contrary, who will &s;ub&s;cribe to the new loan, and inve&s;t his money at once in that fund which offers him the greate&s;t advantage. To &s;ay that he will be tempted by the low price of the three per cents. to ve&s;t his money in the old funds, is a bad argument; becau&s;e, if tho&s;e &s;tocks are very low, the holder of them will get nothing by changing the &s;ituation of his property, con&s;equently will not &s;ell. Money once ve&s;ted in the funds, is con&s;idered in &s;ome mea&s;ure as locked up till the end of the war. For this rea&s;on people, who under|&s;tand making the mo&s;t of their money, employ it in the purcha&s;e of navy and victualling bills, (which mu&s;t be paid off at par from time to time, and are therefore &s;eldom at any great di&s;count) or in India bonds. By this means they have their money ready to take advantage of the nece&s;&s;ities of government. Upon the whole, it &s;eems at lea&s;t very que&s;tionable, whether the chief or any con&s;iderable part of the new &s;ub&s;cription is filled by the &s;ale of the old annuities. Active and intelligent men, con&s;tantly attending upon the &s;pot, may perhaps find their advantage in &s;elling old &s;tock to make good their &s;ub&s;criptions. Dealing in large &s;ums, and calculating every minute profit, &s;uch as that of paying by in&s;tallments, the ri&s;e of lottery tickets, &amp;c. they may undoubtedly turn their practice to account. But advantages of this &s;ort, I conceive, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be confined to the adepts, who cannot be very numerous.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> It is a common mi&s;taken notion that, when &s;tocks fall, it is owing to want of credit. It is ab&s;urd and ridiculous to &s;ay that credit fails, while government can borrow &s;everal millions
<PB N="10" REF="30">
&s;terling; but it is natural enough that &s;tocks &s;hould fall at a time when very con&s;iderable &s;ums are demanded for new loans, and when it appears that, from the continuance of the war, the &s;ame operation mu&s;t be repeated for &s;everal years. As money becomes &s;carce, it becomes more valuable, and ri&s;es in price, like any other commodity, in proportion to the demand. The &s;tate, having occa&s;ion for money, is obliged to give a greater intere&s;t. This, for a moment, &s;inks the old &s;tocks, becau&s;e every man finds his account in &s;elling out, in order to inve&s;t his capital in the new loan, or &s;ub&s;cription, which offers him a higher rate of intere&s;t. Other accidents make money &s;carce for a time, and &s;ink the &s;tocks, without its being any way a &s;ign of a defect of credit. When credit really fails, it is impo&s;&s;ible to borrow large &s;ums upon any terms; and then, the more we

offer, the le&s;s we find. England was never in this &s;ituation in the la&s;t, or the preceding war. An intere&s;t of half per cent. more or le&s;s, made all the difference. Credit, that is the power of finding funds, however exorbitant, to &s;upport the expence of the campaign, never wavered a moment, neither in the year 1744, nor in the la&s;t war. <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">It is true that the faith of parliament to the public creditor has never yet been violated in the minute&s;t in&s;tance, and that government has borrowed &s;ums that exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine ideas of the re&s;ources of the nation. But it is not &s;o true that the credit of the nation has never been &s;haken, nor that an intere&s;t of half per cent. more or le&s;s made all the difference. We have &s;een our funds at forty per cent. di&s;count. The nece&s;&s;ities of government in this country, as well as every other, have obliged the mini&s;ter to &s;ubmit to whatever conditions the moneyed men thought proper to impo&s;e. When the&s;e conditions were the mo&s;t favorable to government, the douceurs amounted to as much as the increa&s;e of intere&s;t. If in fact the re&s;ources of England have never been exhau&s;ted, it may yet be prudent to remember that, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, 1765, above two years after the la&s;t peace, Mr. Grenville was obliged to leave an unfunded debt of four millions; a con&s;iderable part of which was a charge upon the &s;inking fund.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The Bank, on the other hand, had formerly the precaution to give little premiums to moneyed men, who, upon pre&s;&s;ing occa|&s;ions, undertook to furni&s;h &s;pecie to be circulated by the Bank in other quarters. The Bank then was always &s;ure of finding funds to pay the bills which poured in upon it; and, even &s;uppo&s;ing the Bank to have gone to the bottom, which is impo&s;&s;ible, <NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">The author's idea, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Bank to go to the bottom, is totally groundle&s;s. He admits, that the Bank is no more than a rich individual in the &s;tate. Now a corporation, or a private banker, may be ruined by exactly the &s;ame means, viz. by extending their credit beyond their faculties. The fir&s;t alarm or &s;u&s;picion brings all their notes upon them at once; and whether they refu&s;e payment, or delay it by tricks and contrivances, they are equally bankrupts; their note is not paid on demand. The di&s;tre&s;s of the Bank in 1745 is not capable of exaggeration. Their notes were at di&s;count; they were obliged to pay in &s;ilver; their clerks indu&s;triou&s;ly made mi&s;takes in counting, in order to gain time. Yet all the&s;e expedients would have &s;ignified nothing, if a number of private per&s;ons had not agreed to take their notes in payment.

it has no concern with the national debt, which is not demandable, and never can be reclaimed, as all France, and many writers upon this &s;ubject, have very fal&s;ely conceived. As long as the intere&s;t is paid, there is no other demand. As to the re&s;t, Bank &s;tock is very different from Bank bills. India and South Sea &s;tock are again of a different nature; although the&s;e three corporations (the name appropriated in England <NOTE N="10" PLACE="foot">The&s;e companies are <HI>incorporated</HI> by charter and act of parliament, therefore called Corporations.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> to &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments) have all a credit upon government of many millions &s;terling in annuities, the capital of which makes part of the national debt, and never can be demanded. <NOTE N="11" PLACE="foot">The principal debt is not demandable; that is, &s;trictly &s;peaking, it is in the brea&s;t of parliament to pay off the public creditor at &s;uch periods, and in &s;uch proportions, as they think proper, either at par, or on terms voluntarily agreed to by the creditor. Still however the faith of parliament is engaged to apply the &s;inking fund as far as po&s;&s;ible to the diminution of the debt. The creditor has a right to con&s;ider that fund as the &s;ource, out of which the principal is to be gradually di&s;charged. To divert it to other purpo&s;es, is in no &s;mall degree a breach of parliamentary faith, excepting in tho&s;e ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, in which extraordinary &s;ervices may require extraordinary &s;upplies. The author's idea, that the &s;tate is bound by no obligation to its creditors, but for the punctual payment of the intere&s;t, or, in other words, that the debt is only a perpetual annuity, will never be adopted by a wi&s;e or hone&s;t mini&s;ter. At the original formation of the &s;inking fund, it was declared by the legi&s;lature to be appropriated to the di&s;charge of debts contracted before December, 1716; and the proof that it has been always con&s;idered as a &s;ecurity for the principal debt is, that whenever it has been mi&s;ap|plied, &s;tocks have con&s;tantly fallen.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> The pretended bankruptcy of England has therefore always been

<P>Be&s;ides, there is annexed to each loan a &s;olid, &s;eparate, and di&s;tinct &s;ecurity for paying the intere&s;t, for which the whole nation in a body is re&s;pon&s;ible and guarant&eacute;e, every thing being done with the &s;anction of parliament. All the different orders of the &s;tate are intere&s;ted in the funds, which con&s;titute one part of their property, and give value to the other. The nobility, who have a large portion of the land, have al&s;o a &s;hare in the annuities. The proprietors of land have a great concern in the annuities. Trade&s;men, merchants, and even mechanics, are all of them annuitants. It is mere declamation to repre&s;ent the proprietors of the public funds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A quotation from the Bilan general de L'Angleterre.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"as men who carry their fortunes in their pocket-books; as drones that devour the honey made by the bees; a race of men, enemies to the plough, and to the landed intere&s;t; and, in &s;hort, a public pe&s;t in every &s;tate, where they live in &s;ordid avarice, and labor night and day to accumulate money, to &s;well their accounts, and to increa&s;e the burthen of the &s;tate."</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When the author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> treats the&s;e pretended book-keepers as bad citizens, he forgets the text of the Go&s;pel which &s;ays, that, <HI>Where your trea&s;ure is, there will your heart be al&s;o.</HI> A trea&s;ure of more than a hundred millions attaches many hearts to a country, and &s;o much the more as all this money would vani&s;h into &s;moke, if the &s;tate were overturned.

This whole picture is not only loaded, but entirely fal&s;e and chimerical.

As long as &s;uch enormous &s;ums were to be rai&s;ed, it was impo&s;&s;ible for government to make a thrifty bargain.

to government. We have &s;een that this debt is not demandable; that government has fixed no term for di&s;charging it; that a &s;olid and permanent fund is engaged to pay the intere&s;t without interruption, the moment it becomes due; and that every thing is done with the &s;anction of parliament; &s;o that the whole nation may be &s;aid to have concurred in creating the&s;e annuities, and to have become guarant&eacute;e and &s;ecurity for the intere&s;t. We mu&s;t not forget, that the &s;tate is at liberty to di&s;charge its debts whenever it thinks proper, <NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">That is at par, or on terms voluntarily accepted by the proprietor. The condition, which for the &s;ake of the public &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be obtained in all loans, viz. that they &s;hall be redeemable at the plea&s;ure of parliament, gives a &s;ignal advantage to the debtor over the creditor. If there be a plenty of money, parliament can either pay you off, or reduce your intere&s;t, ad libitum; whereas, though money be ever &s;o &s;carce, when con&s;equently the creditor might employ it to infinitely greater advantage than in the funds, he cannot call in his capital. In con&s;idering the increa&s;ed ma&s;s and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the funds, it is not likely that the intere&s;t they bear can ever be reduced below three per cent. nor, perhaps, for the public good, is &s;uch an operation very de&s;ireable, unle&s;s the nation were immediately relieved from a proportionate quantity of taxes, or unle&s;s we could be a&s;&s;ured that parliament would religiou&s;ly apply the &s;avings to the di&s;charge of public debt; otherwi&s;e, as Doctor Price ob&s;erves, reductions of intere&s;t only furni&s;h with more money for &s;upplying the defieiencies ari&s;ing from bad manage|ment, and facilitate the means of running into debt.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> except the la&s;t loans, which cannot be redeemed for &s;ome years.

<P>The &s;crupulous and inviolable exactne&s;s, with which the intere&s;t has con&s;tantly been paid, and the idea we have formed of parliamentary faith, have enabled the credit of England to negotiate loans which have a&s;toni&s;hed Europe.

The explanation, if I am not mi&s;taken, will throw a new light upon the &s;ubject, and correct a number of confu&s;ed notions, which people of the be&s;t under&s;tanding have formed upon this important point.</P>
<P>It is not foreigners only who are unacquainted with the nature of the national debt of England; the natives them&s;elves mi&s;take the matter. Many Engli&s;hmen, as well as foreigners, con&s;ider the debt as a counterpoi&s;e to all their &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Supported by the authority of Lord Bolingbroke, Sir Robert Walpole, Sir John Barnard, and other great men, they look upon the national debt as an unwieldy burthen, that oppre&s;&s;es the kingdom and enervates the power of the &s;tate. Their apprehen&s;ions, I believe, are founded upon the following principles.&mdash;The more a government is indebted, the more the nation mu&s;t be loaded with taxes to &s;atisfy the intere&s;t only; this of it&s;elf is a great inconvenience. The &s;econd, re&s;ulting from the fir&s;t, is, that increa&s;e of taxes rai&s;es the price of labour, and injures manu|factures. The third is the tribute paid to foreigners who have property in the funds. The fourth, which has been much and long in&s;i&s;ted on, is the &s;pirit of idlene&s;s, gaming, and &s;tock|jobbing, introduced into the nation by the traffic carried on in the funds. The&s;e four objections &s;eem, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to ju&s;tify every declamation again&s;t the national debt: yet I think I can demon&s;trate, from &s;peculation and experience, that what has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject is more &s;pecious than &s;olid; and that people have talked, without entering thoroughly into the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t prove, that the national debt has increa&s;ed the numerary wealth of the nation; that it is nece&s;&s;ary to the
<PB N="17" REF="37">
&s;upport of circulation, by which it was produced, and of the excentric commerce which Europe, and particularly of that which England carries on in the other quarters of the world; in &s;hort, that it is highly u&s;eful, up to a certain point; that taxes, in a great mea&s;ure, return into the hand that pays them, and, in&s;tead of injuring, are favorable to indu&s;try; that the advantages ari&s;ing from &s;tockjobbing are far &s;uperior to the mi&s;chief it occa&s;ions; that, without the game carried on in the &s;tocks, England would not have had the means of making the efforts &s;he has done; and that this la&s;t article has never been well under&s;tood by tho&s;e who have treated of it. They have &s;een the effects, and have always been ignorant of the cau&s;es. The&s;e I mean to explain. England is in the &s;ituation of a man who finds him&s;elf extremely well, breathes freely, and enjoys the mo&s;t ruddy health; but who is not &s;ufficiently ver&s;ed in anatomy to know the principles of the health he enjoys. If he be told, that po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome lurking di&s;order may be concealed under this florid appearance, he at once takes the alarm, perplexes him&s;elf with apprehen&s;ions, and is a prey to unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us come to the fact. I affirm that the national debt has enriched the nation, and I prove it thus. On every new loan the government of England mortgages a portion of taxes to pay the intere&s;t, and creates a new artificial capital, which did not exi&s;t before, which becomes permanent, fixed and &s;olid, and by means of credit circulates to the advantage of the public, as if it were in effect &s;o much real trea&s;ure, that had enriched the kingdom. Let us take for an example the twelve millions borrowed in the year 1760, and &s;ee what became of them. Is it not true, that the greate&s;t part of that money was &s;pent within the nation? Nothing but the &s;ub&s;idies, and a <HI>part</HI> of the &s;ums expended in Germany, can be con&s;idered as lo&s;t. I &s;ay a <HI>part,</HI>

for, even in a war upon the continent, the nation profits by furni&s;hing a variety of articles, as well as by the individuals who are employed there. When they water Germany, they only fertili&s;e a &s;oil, of which their commerce reaps the benefit. The riches of Germany always turn to the account of trading nations. But I content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that it is indi&s;putable that a great part of the above loan was employed and circulated within the nation. England then will have pre&s;erved a con&s;i|derable &s;hare of the&s;e twelve millions, di&s;per&s;ed and ab&s;orbed in the nation it&s;elf; at the &s;ame time that the numerary riches of her creditors, who are chiefly Engli&s;h, are augmented by twelve millions, which did not exi&s;t before. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is evident then, that in the year 1761, there mu&s;t have beeen many people in England, who had enriched them&s;elves by the expenditure made by government of the twelve millions borrowed in 1760, and who in return were able to lend money to the &s;ame government by whom they were enriched; and this is actually the ca&s;e. They lend back the &s;ame money they received, and the creditors of the preceding year acquire a new fund of credit, under the protection of which they procure fre&s;h &s;upplies of money, (either from foreigners or their own countrymen) which they again engage in the new &s;ub&s;criptions. This proves, Fir&s;t, the augmentation of the numerary wealth by loans. Secondly, that the new loans are almo&s;t always made with the &s;ame money. Thirdly, that the old loans favor the new ones; and, Fourthly, that they have enriched the nation.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>If another &s;till more &s;en&s;ible proof be required, that the numerary of about a hundred and thirty millions &s;terling, which the Engli&s;h nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in annuities, and other factitious funds, would, in a great mea&s;ure, not have exi&s;ted, without the creation of the&s;e funds, one need only imagine in what would this numerary wealth have con&s;i&s;ted, if the funds had never been in being? <NOTE N="14" PLACE="foot">In an&s;wer to this que&s;tion it may &s;afely be affirmed, that the money lent to government for the &s;upport of wars de&s;tructive of agriculture, commerce, and population, might have been in a great mea&s;ure ab&s;orbed in the cultivation of immen&s;e tracts of wa&s;te lands both in Great-Britain and Ireland, in the encou|ragement of indu&s;trious foreigners to &s;ettle among us, and in the improvement of our colonies ad infinitum. Light taxes would have encouraged population, becau&s;e they do not load the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The price of labor would have been reduced; manufactures found an ea&s;y vent abroad; or, if the foreign market failed, the demands of the colonies would have employed all the indu&s;try of the nation. Population and con&s;umption would have increa&s;ed rapidly together. Con&s;idering the colonies as con&s;olidated with the mother country, and their mutual advantages improved as far as they might be, the Briti&s;h empire might &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, and maintain its greatne&s;s, without any dependence on foreign trade. This is the &s;tate of political perfection, to which, as the author him&s;elf acknowledges, every great kingdom &s;hould a&s;pire. In&s;tead of being employed to the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, the hundred and thirty millions lent to the &s;tate have &s;upported a con&s;tant war again&s;t population, and prevented the exi&s;tence of millions of u&s;eful &s;ubjects.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> Could it have been in money?

of plate, there is not &s;o much &s;pecie in Europe. Could it have been in land? The limits of Great-Britain are not to be extended. Land has already ri&s;en greatly in value, and, without an increa&s;e of population, will not admit of farther improvement. Could it have been in &s;hips and commerce? The&s;e two objects al&s;o have their limits, relative to the number of inhabitants. You cannot ama&s;s commodities beyond your con&s;umption; and too many merchants are frequently a prejudice to commerce. When once there is as much money employed as the demands of trade call for, the re&s;t is u&s;ele&s;s. It is not in the nature of things that the commerce of a nation &s;hould enlarge continually, and introduce greater and greater &s;ums in a perpetual progre&s;&s;ion. Where then would the&s;e millions have exi&s;ted, which con&s;titute &s;o great a part of the wealth of the nation? If at all, they mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in foreign countries, which would be dangerous, even if it were po&s;&s;ible. But no man will maintain &s;uch a propo&s;ition; e&s;pecially &s;ince it is demon&s;trated, that the &s;pecie, which produced the&s;e funds, remained partly in the kingdom, and have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively been employed in every loan.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="40">
If it were po&s;&s;ible to add the&s;e hundred millions (to which nothing but the loans have given an exi&s;tence) to the current coin, the &s;tate would &s;uffer a real repletion of &s;pecie, by which its oeconomy would be overturned. For this money, if it were po&s;&s;ible for it to exi&s;t, would be &s;cattered over the nation, not collected in the Exchequer; it would then entirely lo&s;e its quality of a &s;ign; commodities would ri&s;e to treble their pre&s;ent price, and all commercial proportion be de&s;troyed. But the &s;uppo&s;ition is ab&s;urd. The principles I lay down re&s;olve the difficulty.</P>
<P>The enormous &s;um, of which the national debt is compo&s;ed, never exi&s;ted at once. This ma&s;s of wealth has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively produced with the &s;ame &s;pecie, by the magic of credit and circulation, which &s;aves the inconvenience of having &s;o large a &s;um in &s;pecie. The quantity that really exi&s;ts is &s;ufficient to give an intrin&s;ic value to every portion of the public funds in its turn, without exceeding the limits of an ea&s;y and u&s;eful circu|lation. The public funds have literally a magnetic virtue with re&s;pect to money.</P>
<P>When the proprietors of the old funds undertook to furni&s;h new loans to government, they proceeded thus. They not only found money within the nation by &s;elling their con&s;olidated annuities &s;omething per cent. lower, but they mortgaged tho&s;e annuities to foreigners, and &s;o were enabled to avail them&s;elves of much larger &s;ums, by draughts, than could have been borrowed upon private credit. By the&s;e means they for a time &s;wept away almo&s;t all the money belonging to foreigners, until circulation had time to recover its level, and the new loans could be divided into a greater number of hands. This is the &s;olution of the great problem, or phaenomenon, in finance. The world has been a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;eeing eight or twelve millions borrowed for
<PB N="21" REF="41">
&s;everal years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. It could not po&s;&s;ibly have been done, but by the countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ancient funds, under the au&s;pices of credit and circulation.</P>
<P>Specie communicates its quality to the funds by means of the revenue they produce, but is not increa&s;ed. The numerary wealth is augmented by the funds acquiring a con&s;i&s;tency, and, if I may be permitted to u&s;e the term, a <HI>fixation,</HI> of which money is incapable. It rolls, is di&s;&s;ipated, and pa&s;&s;es from one hand to another. It is the Proteus of wealth, or rather wealth is the Proteus of money. But when once a fund is created, the numerary remains, and the contributive faculty increa&s;es as well as circulation, and without too great an increa&s;e of &s;pecie. Current coin is the univer&s;al medium of expence. It is only when it communicates its quality to a fixed &s;tock, that the numerary augments and is pre&s;erved. This augmentation ari&s;es from the credit created by mortgaging a portion of the public revenue. A light tax is drawn from the nation, into who&s;e hands it returns again, with a general benefit to the whole. The reader is reque&s;ted to con&s;ider this principle attentively. It contains a truth demon&s;trated, palpable, and inconte&s;table, though at fir&s;t &s;ight not ea&s;ily conceived. It is equally evident, and of the &s;ame nature with the principle already e&s;labli&s;hed, that the &s;ame piece of money may in one day pa&s;s through twenty different hands, and repre&s;ent twenty times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively its numerary value as a &s;ign. All my rea&s;oning turns upon the&s;e two principles. The important truths, which I maintain in oppo&s;ition to received prejudices, are derived from them.</P>
<P>To make the former principle &s;till more apparent by another example, let us con&s;ider Europe collectively. It will appear that the real money expended by the powers at war mu&s;t remain, for certainly it is not annihilated; and that the &s;ums they borrow
<PB N="22" REF="42">
upon credit are an addition of numerary wealth, which did not exi&s;t before. This addition, created by credit, acquires, by means of credit and opinion, a value both real and artificial, intrin&s;ic as well as of convention; <NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">There can be no <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> value in a &s;pecies of property, which depends merely on opinion to determine whether it be worth a hundred pounds, or fifty, or nothing.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> that it circulates as long as credit &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and performs by parts the office of real &s;pecie, however chimerical or impo&s;&s;ible it may be to reali&s;e the whole. May not this be the rea&s;on, why the ruin and deva|&s;tation of war is &s;ometimes &s;o &s;oon repaired?</P>
<P>Take one example more. It is certain that there are a hundred lords in France and England, who&s;e united property exceeds, in numerary value, the current coin of the kingdom. It neverthele&s;s obtains its value by circulation, and the fortune of every individual, taken &s;eparately, is real and &s;olid, although the whole together, that is, the equivalent for it in money, does not appear to exi&s;t. Succe&s;&s;ive loans then are always made with the &s;ame identical &s;pecie, which, through the medium of the&s;e loans, communicates its own value to the new funds or paper created by credit, and returning into general circulation in|crea&s;es the power of lending again.</P>
<P>All the millions paid to the king of France, are poured back into the gulph of the nation. The ocean, from whence they &s;prung, receives them in return, although there may be &s;ome ba&s;ons in the ca&s;cade, which, not being in their proper place, may prevent a more u&s;eful di&s;tribution. But if they were to &s;tagnate at their &s;ource, a beneficial circulation would be lo&s;t to the public.</P>

The man who cultivates the &s;oil, is he who really &s;uffers by taxes. <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">Foreigners are much offended at the light tax which they are obliged to pay upon our turnpike roads, not con&s;idering how natural and ju&s;t it is, that the per&s;on who u&s;es the road &s;hould be at the expence of repairing it. In France the ca&s;e is exactly rever&s;ed. The wretched pea&s;ant, who &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es either waggon or hor&s;e, is compelled to keep the roads in repair, while the traveller pays nothing. I have &s;een whole families of pea&s;ants, with their wives and children, employed in this &s;lavi&s;h work, at many miles di&s;tance from their habitations. The&s;e poor people, for want of other cattle, are often obliged to harne&s;s their cows in the carts that convey the &s;tone or gravel to the road. The &s;ight is &s;hocking to humanity. After all this oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, and notwith&s;tanding the beauty of many of their high roads between the principal cities, which is all that foreign travellers are likely to ob&s;erve, there are few of the more civili&s;ed parts of Europe, where the communication between the provinces is &s;o impracticable as in France. The want of cro&s;s roads is a material check to agriculture. The great roads improve the lands within a moderate di&s;tance, but the major part of the kingdom receive no benefit from them. A French writer, who &s;eems thoroughly informed of every thing relative to the internal oeconomy of the kingdom, affirms that the rich corn provinces have no means to convey &s;upplies into tho&s;e parts where they are wanted, but on the backs of mules, becau&s;e the roads or lanes will not admit of carriages; that canals, for internal communication, have been equally neglected; and that it co&s;ts le&s;s, in &s;ome quarters of the kingdom, to bring corn from England or Africa, than to convey it ten leagues by land carriage in France. The &s;ame writer ob&s;erves that, if the millions, expended in forming the canal of Languedoc, had been laid out in &s;maller canals of communication in the interior of the kingdom, they would have been le&s;s &s;plendidly perhaps, but much more u&s;efully, employed. One end of this immen&s;e work was peri&s;hing while they were fini&s;hing the other.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> Statute labor, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Corv&eacute;es.</NOTE> impo&s;ed upon the pea&s;ant, de&s;troys one &s;ource of the opulence of France; for it is this part of the nation that in fact nouri&s;hes the re&s;t, that gives value to the &s;oil, and increa&s;es the numerary wealth.

vice is tributary from its birth. It is a homage which it owes to virtue.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the truth of the&s;e principles, with the nature, e&s;&s;ence, and effect of loans made and applied with judgment, it will be found that, in&s;tead of impoveri&s;hing, they really enrich the &s;tate; that they double the numerary wealth, and of cour&s;e the power of increa&s;ing them. Taxes, for the mo&s;t part, return into the hand that gives them. It is always the rich, or tho&s;e who &s;pend money, that pay the taxes in the la&s;t re&s;ort, as well from their own expences, as by enabling others. They pay &s;o much the dearer for the &s;ervice and labor of the indu&s;trious in the inferior ranks, who frequently make taxes a pretence for greater demands. This circulation nece&s;&s;arily turns to the ad|vantage of indu&s;try, which always finds it&s;elf indemnified for the pretended burthen laid upon it. The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion may be demon&s;trated thus. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When taxes are not &s;o violent as to wither the hand that pays them, the momentary collection of them in the Exchequer, and &s;ub&s;equent di&s;tributions, through the various channels of annuities, pen&s;ions, and other expences, form a new property, which did not exi&s;t before. This created property gives birth to a new circulation, in favor and for the benefit of tho&s;e who paid the taxes. A tax, before it is rai&s;ed, is divided and di&s;per&s;ed over &s;o many millions of &s;ubjects, that its exi&s;tence is hardly perceivable. The portion paid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principle however mu&s;t always be &s;oftened in the ca&s;e of the laborer.</NOTE> by each individual would probably remain in his pocket, or in his che&s;t, and the produce of &s;o much indu&s;try be lo&s;t; little or nothing would come into circulation. If, for example, a tax of a penny each were laid upon the million of per&s;ons, who inhabit Paris, for a &s;ingle day, obliging the rich to pay for the poor, it is certain that the col|lection of &s;uch a &s;um would &s;carce be perceived by any individual; yet if this &s;um were given to one indu&s;trious man, it would make his fortune, and enable him to give an a&s;&s;i&s;tance to circulation, indu&s;try, and con&s;umption, far beyond the diminution tho&s;e articles would have felt by the lo&s;s of the penny taken &s;eparately from &s;o many individuals. In another in&s;tance, if twenty or thirty drops of water were to fall upon the whole &s;urface of the earth, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible a &s;upply would &s;oon be dried up, without fertili&s;ing the &s;oil, or relieving any man's thir&s;t; whereas, if the&s;e twenty or thirty drops were received into a funnel, the collection might form a &s;tream capable of the mo&s;t vivifying operations. There mu&s;t be a focus to collect a number of beings, which &s;eparately have no power, but grow active as they unite. This example, I believe, will not appear indifferent, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who&s;e tact is fine enough for the contemplation of objects of this nature;&mdash;it completely an&s;wers a &s;ubtle objection which might be made to my fir&s;t propo&s;ition, and helps us to comprehend by what &s;teps a tax may reflect a benefit upon the public, by encouraging indu&s;try, as &s;oon as the &s;ums it produces come to a con&s;i&s;tency in the centre of collection to which they belong<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> The four millions &s;terling,
<PB N="25" REF="45">
annually rai&s;ed by taxes to pay the intere&s;t of the funds belonging to the Engli&s;h, produce at lea&s;t fifteen or twenty millions in circulation, which are laid out for the benefit of indu&s;try. That this is true, may ea&s;ily be conceived from the example of the crown piece, which may change hands twenty times a day, and perform the &s;ame daily operation three hundred and &s;ixty-five times a year; and therefore, in the account of that part of the four millions which comes into con&s;tant circulation, large allowance is made for that part which may be &s;uppo&s;ed not to circulate. The revenues, expended by the rich, undoubtedly enable the inferior ranks to engage in other le&s;s con&s;iderable expences with the &s;ame money. To &s;uppre&s;s one million of revenue, would therefore de&s;troy a circulation of &s;everal millions, and dimini&s;h the contributive power of the inferior ranks, by at lea&s;t twenty millions in the cour&s;e of the year. I take a year for the general computation, although the ex|ample, already quoted and proved, might po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t within the compa&s;s of a day, perhaps in le&s;s. Upon this footing, the argument is unan&s;werable, and beyond the reach of all objection. They, who do not thoroughly comprehend the principle, will be unable to follow me through the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the &s;econd inconvenience, we &s;hall be led to reflections which reduce the fir&s;t to nothing, and &s;trengthen my &s;y&s;tem. I affirm, that an advance in the price of labor, and of commodities of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, is not owing to taxes, but to other cau&s;es. This advantage, and even taxes them&s;elves, are a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of having a heap of people collected in the
<PB N="26" REF="46">
great cities by commerce, luxury, and opulence. The true cau&s;e of it lies in the nature of that immen&s;e commerce produced by the di&s;covery of America. The gold imported from that country nece&s;&s;arily continues the pretended inconvenience. It would be &s;till greater if it did not find a remedy in the augmen|tation of the numerary wealth, and in the circulation of the national debt. Effects, attributed to other cau&s;es, have in fact ari&s;en, on one &s;ide, from the deba&s;ement of the metals in their quality of &s;igns; on the other, from the immen&s;e tribute of commodities which America demands from Europe. The mines of Peru have produced two effects, which at fir&s;t &s;ight appear contradictory. Gold and &s;ilver becoming very abundant, and lowering of cour&s;e in their quality of &s;igns, have given birth to a multitude of new wants, and to a mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce. But to &s;upply the new demands, which the lowering of the value of money had it&s;elf created, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the quantity of it &s;hould be prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed. Money then, in its turn, had occa&s;ion to be repre&s;ented by new &s;igns, in order to quicken its own circulation; and the advantages, ari&s;ing from the multiplicity of &s;igns, are &s;uperior to the inconveniences produced by a diminution in the value of the metals.</P>
<P>I affirm, that the po&s;itive re&s;ources, or metallic wealth of the Engli&s;h nation, would be in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands gradually produced by the di&s;covery of America, and that the Engli&s;h government could never have borrowed &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums, if it had not been for the circulation ari&s;ing from the creation of the&s;e very funds. Credit is protected by credit. Circulation favors circulation; paper and public funds &s;upport new paper and new funds, by &s;upplying different loans &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively with the &s;ame &s;pecie, through the medium of circulation,
<PB N="27" REF="47">
and the traffic in the &s;tocks. As the numerary wealth multiplies continually, the national debt gives nouri&s;hment to commerce, and becomes the &s;upport and remedy of that luxury, to which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, it gives birth. It has enriched the nation, and enabled her to pay her taxes. From the&s;e principles it follows, that former debts have enabled the nation to contract new ones. The effect of power becomes the cau&s;e of it. It is the deba&s;e|ment of gold and &s;ilver, in their quality of &s;igns, that has trebled the nominal price of commodities. When we &s;ay that every thing is dearer, we mean that money is le&s;s valuable; and it lo&s;es its value, becau&s;e there is more of it. It may be &s;aid that a man, who has an income of three thou&s;and crowns, is not richer now than his ance&s;tor was formerly with a thou|&s;and; but there are twenty people in Europe, who have three thou&s;and crowns a year, for one who, two hundred and fifty years ago, had a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The increa&s;e of &s;pecie was the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t advance in the price of labor, and of commodities of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. On the other hand, gold and &s;ilver, though prodigiou&s;ly augmented, and become &s;o much more common in Europe, have never|thele&s;s &s;tood in need of being repre&s;ented by new &s;igns, in order to an&s;wer the multitude of new demands, which the fir&s;t abundance of &s;pecie gave birth to. Such, in all probability, is the true origin of banks, actions, paper credit, and public funds, and of the facility with which they have been created. <NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">They, who fir&s;t recommended the &s;y&s;tem of loans in England, had, probably, no other view but to &s;upply the immediate nece&s;&s;ities of government, without burthening the people.

I &s;ay, they fix and collect the riches of individuals. In effect, money in &s;pecie is di&s;&s;ipated and lo&s;t; but having communicated its own quality to the &s;igns that repre&s;ent it, it goes away to perform its office el&s;ewhere, and, &s;upported by credit, &s;till pre&s;erves that communicative quality, of which &s;o many experiments have been made in England, without any proportionate increa&s;e in the quantity of coin, notwith&s;tanding the prodigious increa&s;e of wealth, or of the &s;igns that repre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>To comprehend the connection of the&s;e &s;everal truths, we mu&s;t go back a little, and con&s;ider with attention the revolutions, which have gradually taken place in Europe, &s;ince the compa&s;s enlarged our univer&s;e by the di&s;covery of America. The quan|tity of gold and &s;ilver increa&s;ed &s;o rapidly from that period, that it &s;oon lowered their value as &s;igns. Indu&s;try found employment on all &s;ides. The external luxury of America indemnified the trading nations of Europe for their own internal luxury now carried to exce&s;s, and rai&s;ed the price of labor in two ways; fir&s;t, by lowering the value of money, and afterwards by the quantity of manufactures exported to America. This external commerce has at the &s;ame time obviated the fatal effect of the advance upon the prince of things. It were to be wi&s;hed, that we had an equal compen&s;ation in point of morals, which &s;ince that period have lo&s;t more than they have acquired. It is &s;aid that there is le&s;s &s;implicity, le&s;s truth, in each particular &s;ociety, though &s;ociety in general be improved. <NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">The word <HI>improved</HI> is equivocal.

A ta&s;te for commerce, colonies, marine, navigation, and fre&s;h di&s;coveries, is become the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem. The cultivation of arts and &s;ciences is connected with a ta&s;te for commerce, and has added a new varni&s;h to the politene&s;s of Europe. The ea&s;e, with which a fortune may be acquired, has e&s;tabli&s;hed a kind of liberty and equality, that brings the different ranks nearer together, and bani&s;hes that &s;lavery and deba&s;ement, in which a general poverty, compared with the wealth of a very few indi|viduals, &s;eemed to plunge the people. This perhaps is the greate&s;t benefit derived to Europe from the di&s;covery of America. The fortune of the Medicis was exclu&s;ive and immen&s;e. From a private &s;tation, they became &s;overeigns, and en&s;laved their country. The &s;ubjects of Charles V. and Philip II. on the contrary, drew the means of freedom from the re&s;ources of commerce. The world &s;eemed to enlarge under the power of the Spani&s;h monarchy, and in many re&s;pects altered its form. A general opulence introduced by the gold and &s;ilver of the new world, the multitude of hands employed to &s;upply the new wants and
<PB N="30" REF="50">
luxury of America, have created new means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number of per&s;ons, in affluent or ea&s;y circum&s;tances, is con&s;iderably increa&s;ed in Europe &s;ince the di&s;covery of America. There are more means of gaining a livelihood. I do not at pre&s;ent enquire whether the nece&s;&s;itous, the poor, and the indigent, may not be more &s;o than in former times. Ab&s;tractedly, it may be in &s;ome &s;hape more difficult to obtain the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life. Want, &s;trongly contra&s;ted with overgrown wealth, is more &s;en&s;ibly felt.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> When the political machines, like the elements of commerce, grew more exten&s;ive, va&s;t and complicated, they required &s;prings &s;tronger and more numerous. It became nece&s;&s;ary to multiply the circulation of paper, by which the numerary wealth was increa&s;ed. This was done as it were by in&s;tinct, but with fear and trembling. We &s;carce knew what we were doing, or for what rea&s;on. Gold and &s;ilver having lo&s;t three fourths of their value, a great quantity was required to repre&s;ent &s;o many things, and to keep the &s;ame machines going which money had &s;et in motion. Means of all &s;orts were to be trebled. Without an augmentation of the &s;igns of value, which form an artificial wealth, neither commerce nor luxury could have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. It is the di&s;covery of America, which, by an extraordinary increa&s;e in the ma&s;s of gold and &s;ilver, has extended commerce, luxury, navigation, and manufactures. There required a greater rapidity of circulation; and by a &s;ingular paradox, as money multiplied and grew common, it required &s;o many more &s;igns to repre&s;ent it. Public funds, paper and &s;tocks, became nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ometimes to ab&s;orb an exce&s;s of &s;pecie, and &s;ome|times, like a &s;punge, to be pre&s;&s;ed and give it back again. They fix, increa&s;e, and collect the numerary in one quarter, while the &s;pecie it&s;elf circulates in another. The nation is really richer, becau&s;e it appears &s;o, and furni&s;hes government with greater &s;upplies upon critical and deci&s;ive occa&s;ions; without precluding, however, the u&s;e of proper expedients to relieve the di&s;tre&s;s that mu&s;t re&s;ult from too great a &s;well of the national debt.</P>

It has been already proved, that every loan increa&s;es the numerary wealth. Different loans are always advanced with the &s;ame money; the numerary is doubled by the creation of an artificial property, and the &s;tate is enriched. The Engli&s;h government, by gradually giving up four millions &s;terling a year to their own &s;ubjects and to foreigners, in return for e&s;&s;ential a&s;&s;i&s;tance, has enriched the kingdom with more than a hundred millions &s;terling; whereas not a tenth part of this numerary would have exi&s;ted, without the creation of the funds. The taxes, drawn from the public to pay the intere&s;t, and a&s;&s;igned or mortgaged for this purpo&s;e, are poured back again with u&s;ury. It may well be &s;aid, that the right hand pays the left. It is exactly as if government remitted to the nation a part of the taxes levied upon the nation.

Thus every account is balanced, the numerary phantom of artificial riches continues to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, produces its effect, &s;upports the proprietors, and is beneficial to others. The ma&s;s of repre&s;entative &s;igns &s;upplies the place of a real, &s;olid property.

The di&s;tributive faculty does not wear out, but, in&s;tead of being enervated, acquires &s;trength by exertion. It is probable then, and indeed I am thoroughly convinced, that, without the circulation of the old debt, the Engli&s;h government could never have borrowed &s;uch large &s;ums as they did in the la&s;t war.

<NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot"><P>The extraction of our &s;pecie to pay the intere&s;t due to foreigners has always been con&s;idered as a &s;evere drain to the nation, and one of the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs attending the national debt. The arguments or declamations on this topic are endle&s;s; yet it may be doubted, whether they have ever been candidly compared with the fact. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible &s;peculations mu&s;t &s;ubmit to experience. An internal principle of decay, con&s;tantly operating, can never be reconciled to a continued appearance of health and vigor. In arguments of this nature, &s;ome little fact, mi&s;taken or omitted in the premi&s;es, makes a wide difference in the conclu&s;ion; and then the longer we argue, the farther are we at la&s;t from hitting the mark. Mini&s;ters, and others, who have had all the means of information before them, have found it impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain, with exactne&s;s, the quantity of &s;tock po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by foreigners. The author, in another place, affirms from his own ob&s;ervation, that it cannot much exceed one &s;eventh of the debt; again&s;t which it is but fair to &s;et the &s;ums which Briti&s;h &s;ubjects have in foreign funds, particularly in tho&s;e of France, which pay a higher intere&s;t. If the general &s;uppo|&s;ition be true, that the foreign property amounts to one &s;ixth of the whole debt, or about twenty-two millions, a certain annual drain of &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, added to the great &s;ums &s;pent by our travellers on the continent, or &s;ent over to purcha&s;e foreign finery, mu&s;t inevitably exhau&s;t all our re&s;ources, carry all the &s;pecie out of the kingdom, and keep the cour&s;e of exchange con&s;tantly again&s;t us. Or, admitting that this lo&s;s might be made good by the general profits of our trade, &s;till the nation could never have thriven and flouri&s;hed as it has done, if the whole or greater part of its earnings were con&s;tantly drained away as fa&s;t as they came in. There mu&s;t be &s;ome fallacy in an argument which evidently proves too much for the fact. Upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry that it has been po&s;&s;ible for me to make into this matter, I have found rea&s;on to believe, that, &s;etting a&s;ide &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions, the greate&s;t part of the intere&s;t due to foreigners has not been remitted to them as fa&s;t as it became due, but has been reinve&s;ted in the funds; and that this is &s;till the ca&s;e. The greater part by far of tho&s;e foreigners, who ve&s;t their money in our funds, are not people who mean to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the intere&s;t of it. They leave a portion of their property to accumulate here, either as a re&s;ource for old age, or as a &s;ecurity for their children, while they them|&s;elves continue in that occupation in which they acquired their money. The ju&s;t opinion, which every foreigner, who knows any thing of the matter, conceives of parliamentary faith, and the certainty that no violent mea&s;ures will ever be attempted again&s;t the public creditors, naturally draws all their idle money into this country; and that they leave a con&s;iderable part of the intere&s;t to accumulate, &s;eems farther probable from this fact, that, in peaceable times, immediately after every dividend (deducting the value of the dividend it&s;elf) &s;tocks are con&s;tantly ob&s;erved to ri&s;e. The money thus reinve&s;ted returns into circulation, and, giving birth or encouragement to new indu&s;try, creates a new revenue, which not only pays the foreign annuitant, but leaves a profit of &s;uperlucration within the kingdom. After all, admitting the annuity paid to foreigners to be ever &s;uch a burthen to the nation, it does not feem that di&s;charging the principal would mend the matter. All the difference would then be, whether we &s;hould exhau&s;t the nation of its ca&s;h at once, or by degrees; in other words, whether we &s;hould take this great capital out of commerce and circulation, or continue to pay moderate intere&s;t for a &s;um, the improvement of which, with good management, may produce double what we pay for the u&s;e of it. In&s;tead of general declamations again&s;t paying a great annuity to foreign &s;tates, the only rational enquiry &s;eems to be, whether we gain more by the u&s;e, than we lo&s;e by the intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the debt due to foreigners leaves the nation at their mercy, and that, upon any critical occa&s;ion, they can &s;ink the &s;tocks at plea&s;ure, and di&s;tre&s;s government. This con&s;ideration would be very important, if it were po&s;&s;ible for a foreign court to oblige their &s;ubjects to call in all their funded property at once. The pre&s;ent king of France has attempted it in vain, by i&s;&s;uing mandatory edicts, in which he reproaches his &s;ubjects with want of affection to their country. But this is but a &s;econd-hand policy. Individuals in all countries con&s;ult their own intere&s;t fir&s;t; and &s;o far have they been from complying with the political views of the &s;tates they belong to, that it has been ob&s;erved that, in time of war and apprehen&s;ion, they have always been mo&s;t ready to &s;end their money to England. If they were to attempt to &s;ell out all, or the greate&s;t part of their property at once, they mu&s;t lo&s;e immen&s;ely upon their capital. We &s;hould of cour&s;e pay them off at a great di&s;advantage to them&s;elves, and the nation would clearly gain the difference between the high price, at which they bought, and the low one, at which they would be obliged to &s;ell. Money bor|rowed of foreigners in time of war, be&s;ides an&s;wering the great political purpo&s;e of &s;upply, prevents our drawing an equal &s;um out of trade, or diverting the application of it from beneficial improvements. To extend our trade, or improve our e&s;tates, with other people's money, is good oeconomy in it&s;elf, and implies credit.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE> Let us proceed to the third and greate&s;t inconvenience of the debt. It is certain, that the powers who borrow become tributary to the foreigner who lends. Yet this inconvenience,
<PB N="34" REF="54">
real as it is, is nothing in compari&s;on with the advantages of which we have been &s;peaking. Every thing has its inconve|nience. This one however (inferior in it&s;elf to the advantages
<PB N="35" REF="55">
it produces) is &s;till farther extenuated by tho&s;e derived from the foreigner, who furni&s;hes on demand the &s;ums wanted, part of which are frequently &s;pent in the kingdom. But the point, that mo&s;t de&s;erves to be con&s;idered, is that, without this foreign &s;upplement, by which the mea&s;ure of power is filled up, which keeps the game alive, and of cour&s;e promotes cir|culation, England could not have found &s;uch exten&s;ive re&s;ources. The want of this &s;upplement might perhaps have checked and enfeebled all her operations. I &s;hall explain this point in my an&s;wer to the fourth objection, touching the &s;pirit of jobbing and traffic in the &s;tocks. The &s;ame &s;olution applies to both objections.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that the proprietors of the funds are commonly looked upon as mere book-keepers, who live in idlene&s;s at the expence of the indu&s;trious. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is po&s;&s;ible that, at the end of the la&s;t century, before the credit of England had arrived at this prodigious elevation, the high intere&s;t of money in the funds might have diverted &s;ome individuals from commerce and labor, and confined them to the indolent &s;tate of idle annuitants. It actually happened &s;o; but &s;ince the funds have yielded only a moderate intere&s;t, it is no longer the ca&s;e. It is al&s;o true, that the facility of ve&s;ting money in the funds, of buying for time, of giving premiums, and of winning large &s;ums in a &s;hort time, has been the ruin of many individuals. This game has overturned the fortunes of &s;everal, but it has e&s;tabli&s;hed as many others, and people might equally ruin them&s;elves in any other traffic.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> This is a fal&s;e notion; for the national debt is &s;o voluminous, that it is
<PB N="36" REF="56">
di&s;per&s;ed all over the nation. Every order of the &s;tate has a &s;hare in it. There <NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">When the bu&s;ine&s;s of advancing money to government is monopoli&s;ed by a particular &s;et of men, as it is in France by the farmers general, circulation cannot be &s;o quick and ea&s;y as in tho&s;e countries where every man, who has money, is admitted to &s;ub&s;cribe to public loans, without preference or di&s;tinction. On the other hand, government cannot negotiate with a monopoly on &s;uch favorable terms, as they might with the public at large. The &s;y&s;tem, on which the finances of France are conducted, leave the king, as well as his &s;ubjects, at the mercy of a &s;et of men, who ought to be no more than the collectors of the revenue. In behalf of this &s;y&s;tem it is &s;aid, that, in the moment of nece&s;&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;s, the ill-gotten riches of the financiers are a certain re&s;ource to government, and that, in every arbitrary &s;tate, it is good policy to &s;uffer and encourage one particular order of men to enrich them&s;elves by plundering the people. Having rendered them|&s;elves univer&s;ally odious, it is a &s;atisfaction to the nation to &s;ee them plundered in their turn; and when the &s;overeign extorts from them, by main force, what they had extorted by fraud and inju&s;tice from their fellow &s;ubjects, he has the credit of doing an act of ju&s;tice to his people. This is one of the wi&s;e maxims of &s;tate &s;uppo&s;ed to have been recommended to Lewis XIV. by Mr. de Louvois. The &s;ame upright mini&s;ter, in another place, recommends the employing a multiplicity of officers and collectors in every branch of the revenue. He ob&s;erves that the dexterity of the&s;e per&s;ons, in multiplying and perpetuating law-&s;uits, and obtaining deci&s;ions in favor of the contractors, are of &s;ingular u&s;e to mortify the nobility, and to reduce the people into that &s;tate of annihilation, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to keep them quiet. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Les officiers, qui &s;avent adroitement multiplier les proc&egrave;s, les perpetuer, ou les juger au profit des traitans, &s;ont d'un grand &s;ecours &agrave; entretenir le peuple dans I'etat d'aneanti&s;&s;ement, ou il faut qu'il &s;oit pour demeurer pai&s;ible, et &agrave; mortifier la noble&s;&s;e par mille vo&iuml;es indirectes."</Q> Whether the&s;e be the words of Louvois or not, it is certain that they contain the great funda|mental principle of French government.

As for &s;tockjobbers, they are certainly the levers that move the machine. <NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot">The author's principle, that &s;tockjobbing has facilitated the negociation of large loans, may, in a great mea&s;ure, be well founded. But his earne&s;tne&s;s to prove it &s;o, hurries him into the a&s;&s;ertion of propo&s;itions too fal&s;e and dangerous to pa&s;s unnoticed, and which in effect he &s;oon retracts. He ob&s;erves, in another place, that a man ruined is a fruitful plant withered up, who&s;e numerary wealth cea&s;es to exi&s;t. Nothing is le&s;s likely to be true in argument, or certainly more fal&s;e in fact, than that the ruin of any number of individuals, who lo&s;e their fortunes in 'Change alley, or by any other &s;pecies of gaming, is the making or e&s;tabli&s;hment of an equal number of other fortunes. Great &s;ums, ea&s;ily gained, are &s;quandered in an extravagance which not only brings di&s;tre&s;s along with it, but di&s;ables the mind from returning to habits of oeconomy and active indu&s;try. The in&s;tances of per&s;ons, prudent and re&s;olute enough to retire with their winnings, are &s;o very few, that, if they de&s;erve to be con&s;idered at all, it is only as exceptions, by which a general rule is confirmed. In the mean time the enormous expence of the game it&s;elf, and the total di&s;regard of money, which naturally ari&s;es from a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of great profits and great lo&s;&s;es, and from a continual circulation of large &s;ums, operates uniformly and without intermi&s;&s;ion, and in the end is the ruin of all parties. It is al&s;o very material to ob&s;erve that, if gaming produced no other effect but that property &s;hould &s;uddenly change hands, the elevation of one man is no compen&s;ation to &s;ociety for the ruin of another. They are both, perhaps, equally mi&s;chievous in their effect. It is not merely a transfer of pro|perty, indifferent to all but the parties them&s;elves; nor is it merely a change of place, to which the minds of men are ea&s;ily accommodated. Both parties are apt to be corrupted by the novelty of their &s;ituation. On one &s;ide we &s;ee folly, in&s;olence, vanity, extravagance, and a pernicious example; on the other, a total lo&s;s of &s;pirit, pride, honor, and independence. If this &s;udden transfer of wealth, in&s;tead of being confined to a few individuals, were to become univer&s;al, the &s;tate could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t a moment. It is true, that a merchant may be ruined in any other kind of traffic; but the circum&s;tances of the two ca&s;es are no way parallel. In the ordinary cour&s;e of a &s;ucce&s;sful trade, a great fortune is &s;lowly acquired. In a lo&s;ing trade the approach to ruin is gradual. By care and manage|ment it may be &s;topped at different &s;tages; by &s;trenuous re&s;olution it may be recovered at the la&s;t. In the mean time a branch of commerce, by which an indivi|dual is ruined, may furni&s;h employment for thou&s;ands; and misfortunes in trade are not, like lo&s;&s;es at play, a di&s;grace to the man who &s;uffers them. They excite the compa&s;&s;ion, and never fail to engage the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of &s;ociety. As for tho&s;e exten&s;ive enterpri&s;es, and unlimited &s;peculations, by which a fortune may be lo&s;t or acquired in a moment, they are not founded on true commercial principles, but belong to the chapter of Gaming.

The difference between the price of the con&s;ols and India annuities is generally from three to four per cent. and India bonds, when they bear only three per cent. are frequently above par. Caeteris paribus, the marketable quality of a commodity increa&s;es its value.

Their method is then to lay out ten, fifteen, or twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling in annuities, which they &s;ell, for a &s;tated time, to the dealers in the &s;tocks. By the&s;e means they receive good intere&s;t for their money, without being &s;ubject to variations in the price of the principal, which go to the account of the jobber; and the negociation is continued for years, to the amount of millions. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by this practice, the Engli&s;h government has borrowed &s;ums, which, without the traffic in the &s;tocks, and the ingenious contrivances of &s;tockjobbers, could never have been rai&s;ed. By &s;uch management the Engli&s;h government has not only &s;wept up the money of tho&s;e who were inclined to ve&s;t their money in the &s;tocks, but al&s;o of tho&s;e who had no &s;uch inclination. This, I believe, is a &s;ecret which government it&s;elf was not acquainted with.</P>
<P>The benefit then, derived by government from the dealers in the &s;tocks, is unque&s;tionably immen&s;e. If after that I &s;hould be a&s;ked what I thought of the employment, I &s;hould frankly confe&s;s, that I would di&s;&s;uade my children, friends, and relations, from meddling with it. It is a dangerous trade, and has of late
<PB N="40" REF="60">
been gro&s;ly perverted. It requires a man of great knowledge in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and who makes it his only occupation. When people engage in it, as it often happens, to repair a broken fortune, or to make one rapidly, they find it a more dangerous game than any other. Many a man, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to be ruined by &s;tockjobbing, had recour&s;e to it only when he was already, from other cau&s;es, in the road to ruin, and, in many ca&s;es, might have avoided it, if, in&s;tead of employing a method &s;o full of danger and &s;eduction, he had at once cut the mi&s;chief to the quick, by a prudent oeconomy, by lowering his e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, by overcoming the vain opinion of the world, and &s;etting him&s;elf above it. This point would furni&s;h materials for a long train of rea&s;oning, and a &s;eparate treati&s;e.</P>
<P>The traffic in the &s;tocks divides into various branches, and forms a very complicated &s;ubject. It may be carried on with prudence, and with a certain profit, where a man only means to make the mo&s;t of his property without any of the ri&s;ques of play. If &s;peculations in the funds do not exceed the abilities of the per&s;on who &s;peculates, and if he does not &s;uffer him&s;elf to be governed by his broker, there is le&s;s hazard in this game than any other. I have touched this matter lightly in a &s;eparate E&s;&s;ay on Stockjobbing. <NOTE N="25" PLACE="foot">This e&s;&s;ay, relating chiefly to the practice in Holland, is not tran&s;lated. No good purpo&s;e can be an&s;wered by explaining a &s;cience, which it is no hone&s;t man's intere&s;t to &s;tudy, and which no man can be ma&s;ter of, without engaging in the practice. To &s;peculate with &s;afety, the author makes it a condition that you &s;hall not be governed by your broker. The condition alone amounts to an interdiction.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>If, without the traffic in the &s;tocks, the power of the Engli&s;h to rai&s;e money had only amounted to two thirds of what the &s;ervices demanded, tho&s;e two thirds would probably have been
<PB N="41" REF="61">
thrown away. The advantages they gained would not have taken place, and their lo&s;&s;es would have been as great as their &s;ucce&s;&s;es have been. When a power is wanted equal to ten, and we po&s;&s;e&s;s but five, the proportion is not as two to one, but very often as ten to nothing. We lo&s;e all that we employ, becau&s;e feeble efforts are not only ineffectual, but dangerous, and turn again&s;t the party that u&s;es them. Slowne&s;s in one degree is the cau&s;e of it in a greater, and feeblene&s;s produces feeblene&s;s. If the Engli&s;h had &s;ent a fleet and army, weaker by one third than it was, to conquer the Havanna, the expedition would have mi&s;carried. Not only the whole expence would have been lo&s;t, but that lo&s;s would have occa&s;ioned many others. In&s;tead of the trea&s;ure, and other advantages produced by their &s;ucce&s;s, every circum&s;tance would have been inverted. I do not, there|fore, exaggerate in what I &s;ay of the inequality in the proportion. In politics, the effect of doing all that is wanted, compared with doing two thirds of it, in&s;tead of being as three to two, is &s;ome|times as all to nothing. The whole &s;ucce&s;s depends upon &s;ome little &s;upplement of power, to which if &s;tockjobbing and foreigners contribute, or if they are nece&s;&s;ary to obtain it, they cannot be too much con&s;idered and encouraged. Now it is demon&s;trated, that, if it were not for the circulation which this gaming excites among foreigners and in the kingdom, moneyed men would never venture to engage &s;o deeply in a new loan, or would not find &s;upplies, with that a&s;toni&s;hing and requi&s;ite celerity, at the moment they are demanded. It is the ready market that encourages to enterpri&s;e, and favors circulation. That produced by gaming is prodigious. It is inconceivable how much it facilitates the means of di&s;po&s;ing of funded property at every in&s;tant, and for very con&s;iderable &s;ums. To this facility, which individuals find in di&s;po&s;ing of their property, England is
<PB N="42" REF="62">
indebted in part for the ea&s;e with which &s;uch enormous loans have been made, and for the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es that have attended them. The benefit therefore is far &s;uperior to the inconvenience re&s;ulting from &s;tockjobbers and &s;oreign creditors. Both one and the other have been e&s;&s;entially u&s;eful to England, and con|tributed not a little to the &s;ucce&s;s of her military operations. This was the point to be proved.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the national debt, far from being an oppre&s;&s;ive burthen, has enriched the kingdom, and encouraged commerce; and that the mi&s;chief of taxes and impo&s;ts is in part fallacious. We have &s;een the true cau&s;es of advance in the price of labor, and commodities of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. It has been &s;hown how much &s;tockjobbing, and the concern which foreigners have in the funds, contribute to credit and circulation. Particular inconveniencies, which I readily admit, can never balance &s;uch &s;ignal advantages.</P>
<P>The&s;e principles, however, are not to be carried too far. It is po&s;&s;ible to accumulate the national debt to a point that would greatly di&s;tre&s;s the kingdom. There is a <HI>maximum</HI> of two &s;orts to be equally avoided. One is the amount of the intere&s;t provided for by taxes. The other concerns the ma&s;s of paper in circu|lation. I believe we are at a greater di&s;tance from the fir&s;t than the &s;econd. It will appear in the cour&s;e of this work, that all the re&s;ources of England, with re&s;pect to taxation, are not yet exhau&s;ted; whereas it has been believed, that repre&s;entative &s;igns in paper could not circulate beyond a certain proportion with the current &s;pecie. Speculative calculators have limited this proportion to three to one. <NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t be an arbitrary &s;uppo&s;ition, taken at random, without facts or data. In England all the &s;peculations and prophecies on this &s;ubject have been con&s;tantly confuted by experience. The highe&s;t computations carry our &s;pecie but a little beyond thirty millions. Others reduce it to eighteen or twenty. Taking it at a medium of twenty-five millions, the debt alone, compared with the &s;pecie, is above five to one. If to the ma&s;s of the public debt we add the quantity of paper i&s;&s;ued by the Bank, the &s;tock of trading companies, notes of bankers and private traders, India bonds, exchequer bills, &amp;c. perhaps it would be rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e (for certainty is not to be had) that paper in this country is to &s;pecie in the proportion of ten to one at the lea&s;t. In the year 1719, Mr. Law's new Bank and We&s;t-India Company had i&s;&s;ued paper, or created actions, within a very &s;hort &s;pace, to the amount of above &s;ix thou&s;and one hundred and thirty-eight millions of livres, when the whole &s;pecie in the kingdom did not exceed twelve hundred millions. This, perhaps, con&s;idering the nature of the French government, and the rapidity of the operation, is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary facts in the whole hi&s;tory of finance. A very ingenious French writer ob&s;erves upon it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That &s;o great a di&s;proportion might perhaps have been &s;upported in a free country, if it had been gradually introduced. The people, accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the nation as a permanent body, accept of national &s;ecurity the more readily, from not knowing the exact extent of the re&s;ources, at the &s;ame time that they conceive a favorable opinion, u&s;ually founded upon experience, of the ju&s;tice of the nation. Under this prejudice, credit is often carried beyond all the re&s;ources, and all the &s;ecurities. England is a proof of it. It is not the &s;ame in ab&s;olute monarchies, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e which have often violated their engagements. If, during a moment of delirium, an unlimited confidence &s;hould happen to be repo&s;ed in government, that confi|dence always ends in the folly that gave it birth. Their in&s;olvency then &s;trikes every eye. The good faith of the monarch, the funds, the &s;ecurity, every thing appears to be imaginary. The creditor, recovered from his fir&s;t delu&s;ion, demands his money with an impatience proportioned to his anxiety. The truth of this ob&s;ervation is confirmed by the Hi&s;tory of Law's System."</Q><HI>&mdash;Hi&s;toire Philo|&s;ophique des Etabli&s;&s;emens dans les Indes,</HI> ii. 52.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> But uniform experience in
<PB N="43" REF="63">
England has proved to a demon&s;tration that it may be carried much farther. Still, however, it demands a limitation. One inconvenience occa&s;ioned by the enormous ma&s;s of paper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the name of Paper the author here includes &s;tock, and every kind of fictitious wealth.</NOTE> is, that the price of &s;tocks is more &s;en&s;ibly affected now, than
<PB N="44" REF="64">
formerly, at the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of political events. The&s;e convul&s;ions are greater than they u&s;ed to be, and at all times injurious to the public. It is no failure of credit; <NOTE N="27" PLACE="foot">Though it does not amount to bankruptcy, it is certainly in degree a failure of credit. A merchant, who&s;e notes pa&s;s current at par, has a better credit, and can extend his operations much farther, than he who&s;e &s;ecurities are at ten or fifteen per cent. di&s;count. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with a nation. The true maximum of power in circulation is, when paper exactly repre&s;ents &s;pecie; that is, when the public or private &s;ecurity for a hundred pounds may ea&s;ily be exchanged for a hundred pounds in &s;pecie, or pa&s;s in&s;tead of it, &s;ubject to no other deduction but that of the legal intere&s;t to the di&s;counter. This maximum may be, and is, every day exceeded; that is, both public and private credit are &s;tretched beyond it; in con&s;equence of which, paper cea&s;es to repre&s;ent &s;pecie exactly, and lo&s;es a portion of its value. Increa&s;e the cau&s;e, or &s;tretch your credit &s;till farther and farther beyond the maximum, and the effect will attend it in the &s;ame proportion, until at la&s;t your paper will be worth nothing.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> but the ma&s;s being &s;o great, and in &s;o many hands, there are a greater number of &s;ellers, who &s;peculate upon the &s;ame event. This is one of the chief inconveniencies of the volume of the national debt. In circulation there is a maximum of power, which cannot be exceeded. The public funds are a reali&s;ed alchemy; but we mu&s;t not pierce the crucible. Every thing has its bounds; every thing requires limitation. What the limits of the national debt &s;hould be, is more than I can &s;ay. Perhaps we already touch the border; <NOTE N="28" PLACE="foot">There cannot be a clearer proof that we are very near the maximum of public credit, than that every little event or rumour has a &s;en&s;ible effect upon the &s;tocks. While there was a power of credit in one &s;cale con&s;iderably more than &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the weight of debt in the other, the tricks of intere&s;ted men, or the apprehen&s;ion of political events, made little or no impre&s;&s;ion. The beam was immoveable. Even at the highe&s;t pitch of the rebellion, &s;tocks were not below par. But the enormous addition of debt, incurred in the la&s;t war, has brought credit and debt &s;o nearly to an equipoi&s;e, that the weight of a grain, the breath of an infant, inclines the balance. A dextrous mini&s;ter may keep it even for a time. A wi&s;e and hone&s;t mini&s;ter will never re&s;t till he has given a clear, unque&s;tionable preponderance to the &s;cale of credit, which can no way be effected but by lightening the debt. That the weight of the debt is the only or principal cau&s;e of its depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, is plain from this fact. In the year 1751, that is, only three years after the peace of Aix la Chapelle, when we owed only &s;eventy-five millions, the three per cents. were at a hundred and one; whereas now, after a peace of eleven years, their con&s;tant regular price has been twelve, thirteen, or fourteen per cent. under par. It was Sir John Barnard's opinion, that the price of &s;tocks did not depend upon the whole ma&s;s, but upon the quantity brought to market combined with the demand. It does not appear that the two propo&s;itions contradict each other. They are both unque&s;tionably true, and have a mutual relation as cau&s;e and effect. The quantity brought to market depends upon the whole ma&s;s. If the latter be doubled, the marketable or circulating quantity will al&s;o be doubled; and unle&s;s the demand ri&s;es in the &s;ame proportion (which cannot rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed) there mu&s;t be a glut in the market, con&s;equently the price of the commodity mu&s;t fall. In the&s;e matters, men of great abilities are apt to wander into refinements, as if common &s;en&s;e were not the foundation of all right rea&s;oning.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> perhaps we are &s;till

at a di&s;tance from it. Yet we wi&s;h to a&s;certain this maximum, this point, which cannot be pa&s;&s;ed without danger. It is, I think, a difficult problem. The following principles may however lead to the &s;olution of it.</P>
<P>A variety of principles mu&s;t be combined with exactne&s;s, and the re&s;ult of them con&s;idered. I &s;peak of England only.

particularly that with America, in the con&s;umption of European manufactures and commodities. The more the Engli&s;h improve this branch, the le&s;s their debt will be a burthen to them. The third e&s;&s;ential article is population and agriculture, which form the natural &s;trength of every &s;tate. We all know what phy&s;ical <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phy&s;ical cau&s;es proceed from the Engli&s;h climate, (rather cold than temperate) which makes the women more fruitful, and continue longer &s;o, than in warmer countries; and al&s;o from the &s;oil, which produces the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial nouri&s;hment, and makes the men more robu&s;t. We need only ob&s;erve the hor&s;es and cattle of that country; the agility of an Engli&s;h hor&s;e, the &s;ub&s;tance of Iri&s;h cattle, and the con&s;truction of the human body. A native of Scotland, Ireland, or England, without having the colo&s;&s;al figure of a German, is hand&s;omely proportioned. The con&s;ideration of moral cau&s;es might lead me into a long di&s;&s;ertation. The mo&s;t apparent are tho&s;e which re&s;ult from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion and political con|&s;titution of the country. There is a great di&s;proportion, with regard to the number of unmarried per&s;ons, in prote&s;tant and catholic countries. Mon&s;ieur de Mon|te&s;quieu calls convents, <HI>the gulphs in which future generations are buried.</HI> Some modern writer con&s;iders all monks as a lazy voracious body, that con&s;tantly con|&s;umes, without ever producing. The military order, another body that devours its own members, is not carried to exce&s;s in England. Toleration has repaired the wa&s;te of population, which the new world has occa&s;ioned in the old one. To all the&s;e moral cau&s;es it may be added, that the wor&s;hip paid to women, or the idolatry of the &s;ex, not being carried &s;o far among the Engli&s;h, as it is in a neighbouring powerful nation, that amiable half of the &s;pecies fulfills more exactly the purpo&s;e for which it was intended by nature. The women are not afraid of having a multitude of children at the expence of their beauty. They do not turn again&s;t propagation the attraction given to encourage it. The men, not thinking their children degraded by commerce, do not look upon a numerous family as a di&s;tre&s;s. Exce&s;&s;ive luxury may make them depart from manners &s;o favorable to propagation. The laborer and pea&s;ant are at their ea&s;e. Not being oppre&s;&s;ed, they multiply, and &s;upply the &s;tate with hu&s;bandmen, mechanics, mariners, and workmen. Every nation might enjoy the &s;ame advantage. Coloni&s;ation and celibacy, which formerly were u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to the political &s;y&s;tem, are become mi&s;chievous. Too great a heap of poor, nece&s;&s;itous, uncleanly people, crouded together, was dangerous among our ance&s;tors. It brought on revolutions, tumults, in&s;ur|rections, epidemics, and pe&s;tilence. Men, &s;ays a modern writer, are not made to be piled up on an ant-hill, but to be di&s;per&s;ed over the earth, which it is their bu&s;ine&s;s to cultivate. Thus, in &s;pite of the celibacy of &s;o many monks and nuns, population was &s;till too great before the di&s;covery of America. Cru&s;ades, at that time, did what colonies do at pre&s;ent. Add to this, the civil wars of France, under the Valois; tho&s;e of York and Lanca&s;ter, in England, under the White and Red Ro&s;es; and the wars between nation and nation, particularly tho&s;e of Italy, that va&s;t charnel-hou&s;e and grave of Europe; and it will appear that Europe was better peopled formerly, than it is at pre&s;ent. If we con&s;ider the ma&s;s, or rather the volume, of the human &s;pecies at any given time, and compare it with the pre&s;ent, we &s;hall be a&s;toni&s;hed at the breach made in it by America, by numerous armies, by luxury and colonies. It will be objected, that we no longer &s;ee tho&s;e &s;warms of Goths and Vandals, that i&s;&s;ued from the north to overflow &s;o many countries; yet that they are not in the ca&s;e of having wa&s;ted by peopling America. I an&s;wer, that the&s;e people &s;ettled at once in the countries which they had conquered and laid wa&s;te; that polygamy was permitted among them, and that the north has always been, and is &s;till, the magazine of other nations. Neither the Engli&s;h, nor the Dutch, could po&s;&s;ibly have &s;upported their marine, without a recruit of &s;ailors from the north. Even at this day perhaps the northern countries are proportionably better people than any other. I believe al&s;o that rea&s;ons, drawn from nature and the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, might be a&s;&s;igned for the decrea&s;e of the human &s;pecies, or at lea&s;t for the progre&s;s of depopulation. Still however it will be found to proceed in part from America, and from the numerous armies kept up &s;ince the end of the la&s;t century. A new di&s;ea&s;e attacks the &s;ource of exi&s;tence, and operates upon po&s;terity. The immoderate and daily u&s;e of warm liquids enfeebles the &s;ex, creates vapours, which wa&s;te the con&s;titution much more than infirmities, corrupt the blood, and produce children already kneaded with a morbific leaven. The exce&s;&s;es of the children are added to tho&s;e of their parents. The u&s;e of &s;trong di&s;tilled liquors, which the Arabs fir&s;t invented, and gradually introduced into Europe when they over-ran Spain, has greatly debilitated the human &s;pecies. The&s;e &s;ugared poi&s;ons deprive us of &s;trength and vigor, and de&s;troy the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions. They ravage the world much more than fire and &s;word.

and moral advantages the Engli&s;h enjoy, to encourage population. The re&s;ult of the&s;e combinations determines whether England be &s;till able to &s;upport an augmentation of the public revenue by taxation, without overwhelming the nation, or going beyond its intrin&s;ic power, &s;o that the harmony of credit and circulation may &s;ub&s;i&s;t. This equilibrium is not &s;o &s;trictly exact, but that it may bear a con&s;iderable weight before it gives way. Notwith&s;tanding all the declamations in France and England on the &s;ubject of taxes, they pay much heavier in Holland. Not to reckon other articles, even bread, <NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">A tax on bread would be highly ab&s;urd in England, where it is thought good policy to give a bounty on the exportation of corn. This would be checking the con&s;umption at home while we encourage it abroad, and make good the com|plaint already urged, that we feed the foreign manufacturer at an ea&s;y rate, while we &s;tarve our own. Nor would the produce of the tax be &s;o great as the author imagines. Duties on con&s;umption are in general mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;ubject, and the mo&s;t expen&s;ive in the collection. Sir Mathew Decker affirms, that the exci&s;es on &s;alt, &s;oap, leather, candles, &amp;c. almo&s;t treble them&s;elves to the people for what they rai&s;e to government. If bread were to be taxed in the baker's &s;hop, the con&s;equence would be, that every private hou&s;ekeeper would bake his own bread; and to controll this liberty, by &s;ending exci&s;e officers every day into private hou&s;es, would be &s;uch an intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion as no augmentation of revenue could com|pen&s;ate for. The policy of Holland is, no more than that of France, an example for England. The legi&s;lation of every country mu&s;t corre&s;pond with the prevailing &s;pirit or temper of the people. With re&s;pect to taxation, a Dutchman con&s;iders nothing but the quantum of the tax. An Engli&s;hman con&s;iders not only the burthen, but the mode of impo&s;ing it. In England the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion is liberty, well or ill under&s;tood. The argument, that England is not arrived at the maximum of its re&s;ources, becau&s;e &s;ome few articles of general nece&s;&s;ity are &s;till left untaxed, is not conclu&s;ive. There mu&s;t be a period of taxation on the whole, beyond which the people cannot pay. Pu&s;hing it beyond this point, is con&s;tantly attended with diminution of revenue. The magnifying power defeats it&s;elf, and the object is lo&s;t in confu&s;ion and ob&s;curity. If the taxes, which the &s;ubject already pays, be upon the whole as much as he can &s;upport, and he &s;hould neverthele&s;s be compelled to pay a new tax upon &s;ome of the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, the con&s;equence would be, that he mu&s;t either quit the country (of which almo&s;t every province in France is an example) or he mu&s;t retrench his expences in the con&s;umption of other le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary articles. In one ca&s;e the &s;tate lo&s;es its &s;ubject, who carries &s;o much indu&s;try and con&s;umption away with him; in the other, government incurs the expence of collection, and gains nothing by the tax.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> though

On the contrary, as luxury and expence have increa&s;ed rapidly through all ranks of people, it is to be pre&s;umed, that a much &s;maller part of the annuity, in proportion to the pre&s;ent amount of it, is &s;aved and re-inve&s;ted in the &s;tocks, than was twenty or thirty years ago.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> rather than a prejudice, to the relative price. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exce&s;&s;ive luxury dimini&s;hes this advantage every day.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> No man now hoards his money in a che&s;t, as in former times. All the money circulates. The mi&s;er is as u&s;eful to the &s;tate, as the man of expence. It is only the prodigal, or rather an exce&s;s of luxury, that does mi&s;chief. The advantage it produces is momentary. It is exactly cutting the tree at the root. The mi&s;er, no le&s;s than the oeconomi&s;t, in &s;owing for po&s;terity, circulates his fortune, and &s;upports public credit, paper, and the &s;tocks. The exce&s;s of &s;pecie, beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary for daily expence, trade and commerce, flows back upon the funds; and this &s;upply is perpetuated by a circulation of the &s;ame &s;pecie, which returns periodically, with an increa&s;e received from the trea&s;ures of the new world. For this rea&s;on <NOTE N="32" PLACE="foot">The increa&s;e of debt has a natural and inevitable tendency to rai&s;e the rate of intere&s;t, in&s;tead of reducing it.

The mini&s;ter, who by a zealous, oeconomical admini&s;tration of the finances, and a judicious exertion of the re&s;ources of the nation, &s;hall bring the debt fairly to par, will by that operation reduce the rate of intere&s;t, and throw an immen&s;e capital into trade, or landed improvement, which is now drawn out of it. He will be the patron of commerce, agriculture, and population. In &s;pite of the prejudices of party, it cannot be denied, that neither zeal, nor ability, are wanting at the head of this department.

<P>I think it however e&s;&s;ential to England (and to every other &s;tate) to profit by peace, and to make a good u&s;e of their &s;inking fund, by di&s;charging one third of the national debt, and relieving the nation from a part of the taxes. A &s;inking fund increa&s;es as fa&s;t as it is applied, and, with the addition of the growing intere&s;t multiplied for &s;ome years, con&s;titutes a great power for the di&s;charge of debt. But equity requires that there &s;hould be a period, at which tho&s;e taxes &s;hould cea&s;e, which
<PB N="51" REF="71">
were only rai&s;ed to pay the intere&s;t of loans that are di&s;charged. I do not know whether this point has ever been much attended to in England; yet it de&s;erves the attention of every power that is in debt to its own &s;ubjects. The &s;inking fund of England, being compo&s;ed of the &s;urpluses of taxes mortgaged to pay the intere&s;t of different loans, mu&s;t be applied to general reductions, and cannot relieve the nation from the tax imme|diately relative to each loan. Yet when once the di&s;charge of the debt is accompli&s;hed, it is both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary to take off the tax created to an&s;wer the loan. It would be unju&s;t to continue it.</P>

<P>Experience, a combination of facts, in a word, the actions performed by the Engli&s;h, &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, and the means they employed, unite in proving, beyond di&s;pute, the truth of the&s;e &s;peculative ideas. The ob&s;ervations, made upon this nation by the author of the <HI>Bilan,</HI> are at be&s;t no more than paradoxes, which require a &s;olution. His con|clu&s;ions are contradicted by facts. The &s;peculation and conjec|tures of theory can never overturn manife&s;t facts and vi&s;ible practice.

Their advantages perhaps are not &s;o con&s;iderable as they appear to be; but, to repre&s;ent England in the pre&s;ent moment as a declining, enfeebled &s;tate, and upon the verge of ruin, is a paradox palpably ab&s;urd, and not to be &s;upported.</P>
<P>There is one e&s;&s;ential point which I ought not to omit. In order to favor the circulation of the funds, to maintain their value, <NOTE N="37" PLACE="foot">The rate of intere&s;t can never be reduced as long as the three per cents. continue below par.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> and of cour&s;e to reduce the rate of intere&s;t, which is the object of finance and the &s;ign of a flouri&s;hing credit, one thing is ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. We have already explained the advantage which England derives from the traffic carried on in the funds. It could never &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but for the facility of mortgaging funded property. This operation &s;eems to be for|bidden in France by an exten&s;ion of the law, which forbids lend|ing upon pledges. This law therefore, the &s;pirit of which never could extend to the funds, &s;hould be explained and confined. I do not now enquire whether a Mount of Piety, or a Lombard, might not be of great u&s;e to France, and the mo&s;t effectual means of preventing that &s;hameful u&s;ury, by which &s;o many indi|viduals
<PB N="54" REF="74">
are undone. It is &s;ufficient to remark, that the inconveniencies, apprehended by the legi&s;lature, have no relation to the mortgaging of funded property. Neither dome&s;tic robberies, nor the di&s;order which the facility of lending upon pledges may occa&s;ion in families, have any reference to this ca&s;e. Large &s;ums are lent in Holland, at a moderate intere&s;t, by men of the &s;tricte&s;t honor, and by the riche&s;t magi&s;trates, on the &s;ecurity of the funds; and the lenders thereby contribute to keep up the price, as much as if they them&s;elves were buyers. We all know, that when a man is forced to &s;ell property of any kind at a moment's warning, the buyer takes his advantage and lowers the price; whereas the facility of pledging waves the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling. The owners of &s;tock have time to turn them&s;elves, and are &s;eldom, if ever, obliged to &s;ell at a &s;hort notice; by which the price of &s;tocks is frequently &s;unk for a trifling, incon&s;iderable object. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The expedient of pledging funded property, which formerly favored circu|lation, has of late been fatally abu&s;ed in England. The ca&s;e is this. Many per&s;ons, who had lent money upon &s;tock, began immediately to &s;ell on &s;peculation for time, at a high price, upon their own account. Then, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fal&s;e news, of which there is an inexhau&s;tible manufacture in London, they alarmed the public, and &s;old for ready money a part of the &s;tock, which had been pledged to them, at five and even ten per cent. under the market price. A &s;mall &s;um, &s;old for ready money, commands the market. As the alarm gained ground, they continued this game, until they compelled the per&s;ons, upon who&s;e &s;tock they had lent money, to &s;ell again&s;t their will at the lowe&s;t price. This has been done for a year and a half pa&s;t, both in India and Bank &s;tock, to the ruin of public credit, as well as private fortunes. A &s;hameful de&s;tructive proceeding. There are ways to prevent the&s;e mi&s;chievous intrigues, without checking circulation. It is an object that de&s;erves the attention of government; and the court of King's Bench, I hear, has lately condemned &s;uch proceedings, upon a complaint made in a particular ca&s;e. But this is not &s;ufficient to prevent them for the future. Without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circulation, more effectual means &s;hould be employed, and &s;hall be pointed out in proper time and place.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> On the other hand, there are many people who would be willing to buy large quantities of &s;tock upon &s;peculation; but who&s;e money not being come in, or not being able to employ it in this way, they give up all thoughts

of dealing in the French funds; whereas, in tho&s;e of Holland and England, twenty thou&s;and livres in ready money are &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e a hundred thou&s;and livres in &s;tock, becau&s;e it can always be pledged at a moderate intere&s;t; &s;o that, in&s;tead of paying u&s;urious intere&s;t, the &s;tock it&s;elf produces a revenue ari&s;ing from the &s;urplus of twenty per cent. which the borrower had beyond what he borrowed. Some people pledge their &s;tock for a time, having occa&s;ion for their money el&s;ewhere <NOTE N="38" PLACE="foot">All the ideas of the author, with re&s;pect to pledging of &s;tock, &s;eem very doubtful and ob&s;cure. Pledging of &s;tock is the con&s;equence of di&s;tre&s;s, or want of money; and the banker, or moneyed man, who lends, mu&s;t make his own terms, of cour&s;e not much to the advantage of the borrower. With re&s;pect to the general price of &s;tocks, the mortgage or the &s;ale of a large quantity has exactly the &s;ame effect upon the market. A mortgage is in fact a temporary &s;ale, or aliena|tion of &s;o much revenue, and generally on wor&s;e terms to the borrower than if he was to &s;ell his property outright. Pawn-brokers of all denominations take care to exact an exorbitant intere&s;t for their money. At the &s;ame time, it is not to be denied that they an&s;wer &s;ome purpo&s;es of convenience, and that property of every kind &s;hould be as little fettered as po&s;&s;ible. The facility of bringing it into circu|lation is a real addition to its value.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE>; others merely and &s;imply to receive a great intere&s;t from the &s;urplus, &s;elling their &s;tock to deliver at a &s;tated time, and run|ning no ri&s;que. The&s;e three numerous cla&s;&s;es of men draw a quantity of money into the funds, which would not come in without them. Thus the pledging of &s;tock prevents a large quantity of it from appearing in the market. A great inconve|nience is obviated, or a &s;ignal benefit obtained. The number of buyers increa&s;es prodigiou&s;ly, and the number of &s;ellers dimi|ni&s;hes. From hence we may conceive the utility of the operation. For the public good, for the good of commerce, credit, and circulation, the laws in France, touching loans upon pledges, cannot be too much &s;oftened.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="76">
Let us &s;ay a word of the Dutch funds. It is to be ob&s;erved, in the fir&s;t place, that in France all the funds are confounded under the name of <HI>Paper.</HI> It is common to &s;ay, <HI>Paper ri&s;es or falls in England.</HI> The expre&s;&s;ion is improper. The funds in England are not in paper, any more than the actions in Holland. For this rea&s;on, no man can lo&s;e his actions in Holland, nor his funded property in England, as people in France lo&s;e their actions in the funds, or India company. Yet in Holland one may lo&s;e the <HI>obligations,</HI> or contracts for which the &s;tate is &s;ecurity. The&s;e are in paper, &s;ome payable to the bearer, but the greate&s;t number to the la&s;t owner, with certain deeds annexed to prove the title. There are &s;ome obliga|tions &s;ecured by the <HI>generality,</HI> that is, the Seven United Provinces, bearing an intere&s;t of three per cent. Particular provinces have borrowed money at a higher intere&s;t; but, excepting Holland, they have no great credit. The province of Holland is accountable for the greate&s;t number of obligations, to the amount of many hundred millions of florins. Yet this paper, though it bears but two and a half per cent. intere&s;t, is at par, and above it. Many circum&s;tances concur to &s;upport this enormous credit. The fir&s;t is, that the great riches of the Dutch are in money. It is the country, next to England, where there is the quicke&s;t circulation both in &s;pecie and paper. They have more than the mo&s;t exten&s;ive commerce can employ. The &s;pices, with which they alone furni&s;h all Europe, America, and Africa, maintain and give a periodical increa&s;e to this abundant circulation. No other nation has lent &s;o much as the Dutch to England, France, Saxony, and other powers.</P>
<P>The &s;econd rea&s;on why the paper called <HI>Obligation</HI> is &s;o much &s;ought after, is that there is a law in Holland, by which the guardians or admini&s;trators of the effects of minors, are obliged
<PB N="57" REF="77">
to lay out the whole produce in <HI>obligations,</HI> for which the &s;tate is &s;ecurity. There is in Am&s;terdam, and other cities of Holland, a chamber called the Chamber of Orphans. The principal ma|gi&s;trates are at the head of it. When any per&s;on dies without a will, they take the direction of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and ve&s;t all the produce in <HI>obligations.</HI> There is much good and much evil in this practice. But it is always a leaven that contributes to &s;upport the value and credit of that paper. There are al&s;o &s;ome Hollanders of the old &s;tock, who have no faith in funds, which they do not &s;ee, and who will have all their property in their che&s;ts, in paper &s;ecured by the &s;tate, which they hone&s;tly think is the mo&s;t &s;olid &s;ecurity in the univer&s;e. Brokers and notaries have a &s;ort of brokerage upon &s;ettling the titles in the different transfers; but this operation is too complicated to admit of a detail.</P>
<P>The actions of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t India companies in Holland, and all the royal funds and other actions in England, are transferable, in the re&s;pective offices, under the name and to the account of the purcha&s;er, &s;o that he has no paper given him to keep. The books of the office are evidence of the pro|perty. A foreigner tru&s;ts nothing to his corre&s;pondent. <NOTE N="39" PLACE="foot">A foreigner in the fir&s;t in&s;tance tru&s;ts every thing to his corre&s;pondent; having no evidence that &s;uch a quantity of &s;tock has been purcha&s;ed on his account, and &s;tands in his name, except the a&s;&s;urance of the per&s;on he employs to act for him. This however being once done, his property is &s;ecure. His agent, or corre&s;pondent, can neither transfer the &s;tock, nor receive the intere&s;t upon it, without a particular power; and if any fraud &s;hould be committed, the Bank, or company to which the &s;tock belongs, are an&s;werable to the proprietor.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> There are even printed li&s;ts in England, in which the names of the proprietors of Bank, India, and South-Sea &s;tock, are marked, with one &s;tar if they have a capital of five hundred pounds, with two for a thou&s;and, and three for fifteen hundred;

but no farther. This we know is a &s;pur to &s;ome people to be concerned in the&s;e funds, which in England are called Corpo|rations. Such contrivances &s;eparately appear of no moment; yet, taken together, contribute more than we are aware of to promote circulation, and of cour&s;e to the greatne&s;s and &s;plendor of the &s;tate. What contributes to it much more is the exactne&s;s with which the intere&s;t, and even life annuities, <NOTE N="40" PLACE="foot">The life annuities now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting are very incon&s;iderable.

The delay which people are expo&s;ed to in France, under pretence of being paid in alphabe|tical order, has given great di&s;gu&s;t to foreigners, to the prejudice of French credit. This method is not practi&s;ed in London, and I do not know that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in France. I &s;ee no rea&s;on why a thing, &s;o ea&s;ily done upon the banks of the Thames, &s;hould not be done upon the banks of the Seine, in parallel circum&s;tances. It is known beyond a doubt, that the funds are provided at the appointed time as &s;crupulou&s;ly as in London.

All that has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, from the time of the Romans to this day, proves too much. I much que&s;tion whether the India trade was the ruin of the Romans, as the author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> &s;uppo&s;es. Mon&s;ieur de Monte&s;quieu, in his excellent treati&s;e upon the cau&s;es of the greatne&s;s and decline of that people, mentions this circum&s;tance but very lightly, and only as an acce&s;&s;ary to others of greater importance. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that, even according to Monte&s;quieu, the Romans did not extract &s;uch quantities of gold and &s;ilver from their mines, as we do from America. With us the&s;e metals are commodity as well as &s;ign. To pre&s;erve their value as &s;ign, they mu&s;t be exported as commodity. Secondly, the Romans had no e&s;tabli&s;hments in India, where individuals make immen&s;e fortunes, and return with them to Europe. Thirdly, the Romans hoarded their money. Every thing with them contri|buted to choak circulation, of which they had not the &s;malle&s;t idea. They knew nothing of bills of exchange, nor annuities, nor government-paper bearing intere&s;t. All bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;|acted with &s;pecie. Taxes returned with difficulty into the hand that paid them; and therefore, with a multitude of re&s;ources, they had none when they were mo&s;t wanted. Loans upon critical occa&s;ions were unknown, and would have been impracti|cable. The Barbarians ran&s;omed, or plundered, the empire. They had no expedients of credit to re&s;i&s;t unfore&s;een accidents. The&s;e were the rea&s;ons of their decline; and my &s;y&s;tem is
<PB N="60" REF="80">
&s;upported by them. I do not deny that the India trade may be a commerce of mere luxury to certain powers; but it has been demon&s;trated, that it is a &s;ource of riches to England, and the brighte&s;t jewel in the crown. <NOTE N="42" PLACE="foot">The author, from the conclu&s;ion of the late peace, had entertained the highe&s;t ideas of the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of our Ea&s;t-India company, and the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of the ri&s;ing value of their &s;tock.

Their agents take but little care of the main article of remittance; &s;o that, after a few years of di&s;&s;ipation in this country, with great expence and little enjoyment, many gentlemen find them&s;elves obliged to go back again to collect or recover the remainder of their fortunes.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> The&s;e A&s;iatic &s;punges, per <HI>fas</HI> et <HI>nefas,</HI> bring home periodically a part of the trea&s;ures of India, without which, A&s;ia, from the time of the Romans to ours, mu&s;t have exhau&s;ted not only all the money of Europe and Africa, but even of America. The truth of this propo&s;ition requires no other evidence, but to be expre&s;&s;ed. If the author's a&s;&s;ertion were
<PB N="61" REF="81">
true, the money of all the univer&s;e mu&s;t already be in A&s;ia. His &s;y&s;tem leads to an ab&s;urdity; and every &s;y&s;tem that does &s;o is fal&s;e. The Dutch Ea&s;t-India company enriches the &s;tate, while it impoveri&s;hes the proprietors; a paradox that cannot be accounted for but upon the principle which I have ju&s;t explained. The prodigious and rapid fortunes, acquired by individuals in India, repair the breaches which a commerce, ruinous in it&s;elf from the money it exports, may occa&s;ion in the &s;tate, and even in Europe. We &s;hould be happier perhaps if it were po&s;&s;ible to do without tea, and other exotic drugs of India, as well as without mu&s;lins, and all the u&s;ele&s;s articles of an exce&s;&s;ive and dangerous luxury. But this luxury being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, it would be &s;till more de&s;tructive to purcha&s;e the materials of it from foreigners. I believe that Europe, &s;ooner or later, will recover part of the money, which, after wre&s;ting it with &s;o much difficulty from America by the hands of Africans, we have wa&s;ted upon A&s;ia. Before this great event takes place, I affirm, that the individuals e&s;tabli&s;hed in India have at all times gleaned a part of the trea&s;ure &s;ent thither by the merchants of Europe. It is al&s;o true, that the multiplicity of India compa|nies in Europe has produced various inconveniences. The fir&s;t is, that a greater quantity of &s;pecie is exported than is nece&s;&s;ary to maintain its value here as a &s;ign, which yet, without the export to A&s;ia, would be too much reduced. <NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">The quantity of &s;pecie or bullion exported to India has been a con&s;tant topic of declamation again&s;t the Ea&s;t-India trade. Perhaps it has never been fairly con&s;idered that, if a con&s;iderable proportion of &s;ilver were not annually &s;unk in A&s;ia, it would in a little time be impo&s;&s;ible for Europe to procure a &s;upply of it from America. We quarrel with the market that in fact creates the &s;upply. The quantity of &s;ilver continually accumulating in Europe would le&s;&s;en its value as a &s;ign to &s;uch a degree, that, within a very &s;hort period, the produce of the mines would not pay the expence of working them. The price of European goods would be always proportioned to the whole quantity of &s;ilver in Europe; that is, as the value of &s;ilver fell, the price of every thing &s;aleable would ri&s;e. But as the pro|duce of the mines, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing in that proportion, rather dimini&s;hes every day, it would happen that the &s;ame bale of European goods, which in one year might &s;ell in America for a hundred ounces of &s;ilver, in the next perhaps could not be afforded under a hundred and fifty, and &s;o on till the advance of price upon the American amounted to an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of purcha&s;ing. At this period he would of cour&s;e give up the working of the mines, and endeavour to manufacture for him&s;elf. The &s;troke would immediately revert upon the arts, manufactures, and general indu&s;try of Europe. In this progre&s;&s;ion the &s;igns of wealth become the &s;ource of poverty. We &s;hould have &s;o much &s;ilver that our own colonies could not afford to purcha&s;e the produce of our indu&s;try. The fountain of real wealth would be choaked up. To recover it again, we mu&s;t open the channel, and &s;uffer the &s;tream to flow into another country, contented with its fertili&s;ing pa&s;&s;age through our own. A &s;peculation of this kind does not want the experience of facts to &s;upport it.

a competition in the purcha&s;e of India manufactures, and other exotic commodities, rai&s;es the price in A&s;ia; that is, there is more money wanted to buy the &s;ame quantity of goods. On the other hand, the &s;ame competition &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ales in Europe, lowers the price of what co&s;ts &s;o dear at the fountain head.

The&s;e qualities, added to the rage of &s;y&s;tem and political arithmetic, has made many an ingenious man argue him&s;elf and his readers out of their &s;en&s;es.

<P>Declamations of this kind, borrowed for the mo&s;t part from our party writers, or London news-papers, after a deal of perplexing logic, and &s;till more perplexing arithmetic, u&s;ually end in conclu&s;ions manife&s;tly incon&s;i&s;tent with appearances. In&s;tead of following &s;uch writers through a train of &s;ophi&s;try, by which the cleare&s;t ideas of truth and fal&s;ehood may be confounded, the be&s;t way is to attack them directly upon their facts.

&s;o that in the period, in which he &s;ays we had paid off but three hundred thou&s;and pounds, it appears that the principal debt was reduced above &s;even millions and a half, and the annual intere&s;t above nine hundred thou&s;and pounds, notwith&s;tanding a con&s;iderable mi&s;application of the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>He affirms, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 26.</NOTE> in direct contradiction to the certain knowledge of every man in England, that the value of lands and rate of rents have been gradually lowering &s;ince the Revolution; and this too, notwith&s;tanding a greater cultivation, con|&s;iderable improvements in the art of farming, and an increa&s;e upon the whole of the territorial revenue. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Les proprietaires n'en ont pas moins v&ucirc; diminuer peu &agrave; peu le prix de leurs baux; cela ne pouvoit pas &ecirc;tre autrement."</Q></P>
<P>He repeatedly affirms, that we are forced to borrow money to pay the intere&s;t of debt already contracted abroad. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Il re&s;te toujours pour certain que depuis le com|mencement de 1751, ce n'e&s;t qu'en empruntant que l'Angleterre a p&ucirc; payer les inter&ecirc;ts des &s;ommes qu'elle doit au dehors."</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 199.</NOTE></P>
<P>There may be &s;ome latent, my&s;terious meaning in the&s;e words, which I am not able to dive into. In their plain and obvious &s;en&s;e, they contain a manife&s;t fal&s;ehood. The funds, appropriated to pay the intere&s;t of the national debt, have not only been &s;ufficient to an&s;wer that purpo&s;e, but have left a con&s;tant annual &s;urplus, which has been applied from year to year, either to the current &s;ervice, or to the di&s;charge of debt, to the amount of many millions. On &s;uch wild &s;uppo&s;itions as the&s;e, the author treats the Engli&s;h nation with an indecency and intemperance of language, which in effect reverts upon him&s;elf. Mad, blind, and ignorant, <HI>in&s;en&s;&eacute;e, ignorante, &amp; aveugle,</HI> are the milde&s;t epithets he be&s;tows upon a little country, which, however, by mere dint of &s;uperior policy, courage, and credit, has repeatedly brought the enervated colo&s;&s;us of France to the ground. The credit of this country may, in point of prudence, have been &s;tretched too far. But even the enormous extent of the debt it&s;elf is a proof of the high opinion entertained by individuals, both at home and abroad, not only of the good faith, but of the re&s;ources, of the nation.</P>
<P><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Page 204.</NOTE> He pretends to &s;peak moderately and within compa&s;s, when he &s;ays that a third of the whole debt belongs to foreigners, and that the extraction of &s;pecie to pay the intere&s;t, amounts to one million four hundred thou&s;and pounds a year. On this I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that no man in England ever conceived that the foreign property in the funds exceeded one &s;ixth of the debt; and that many judicious per&s;ons, who are mo&s;t likely to be well informed on this &s;ubject, reduce it to a &s;eventh, and even to an eighth. In England, &s;uch mean di&s;honorable en|deavours to ruin our credit would be received with contempt. In France they are readily accepted for proof, and help to keep up the &s;pirits of the people.</P>
<P>The following in&s;tance will &s;hew that his ab&s;tract knowledge is much upon a footing with his facts. He &s;ays, <NOTE N="*&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 187.</NOTE> that, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'after the peace of Aix la Chapelle, the balance of trade being con&s;tantly again&s;t us, and great &s;ums being &s;ent out to pay that balance as well as the intere&s;t due to foreigners, &s;pecie became &s;o &s;carce, that in the years 1753 and 1754, it was a difficult matter to make a banker pay a hundred pounds in the legal gold of the country; as for &s;ilver, there was &s;carce any left. People were obliged to &s;ubmit to be paid either in bank bills, which are refu&s;able by law, or in Portugue&s;e moidores, which are equally refu&s;able, and which are generally under weight.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mais apr&egrave;s la paix, n'y ayant plus d'emprunts, ce rempli&s;&s;age ruineux avoit ce&s;&s;&eacute;; &amp; l'Angleterre &eacute;tant oblig&eacute;e de payer aux dehors la balance qui alloit contre elle, les e&s;peces devin|rent &s;i rares, qu'en 1753 &amp; 1754 on avoit de la peine &agrave; recevoir ch&euml;z un banquier de Londres le payement de cent livres &s;terling en or legal du pays: quant aux monnoyes d'argent, il n'y en avoit pre&s;que plus.

<P>One would think it impo&s;&s;ible even for a Frenchman to collect &s;uch a quan|tity of fal&s;ehood and non&s;en&s;e into &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s. In the fir&s;t place, it was but in the year 1750, that the uncommon plenty of money had enabled government to reduce the intere&s;t of fifty eight millions &s;terling, from four to three and a half, and afterwards to three per cent. A man who will deny that a reduction of intere&s;t, where no &s;ort of violence is offered to the public creditor, is an infallible &s;ign of the plenty of money, may di&s;pute his own exi&s;tence; but who will argue with him? Secondly, to &s;ay that people were obliged to accept of a &s;ort of payment, which by law they might have refu&s;ed, is a contradiction in terms. Thirdly, the immen&s;e quantity of Portugue&s;e gold at that time in circula|tion, proves that the balance of trade, particularly that of Portugal, was con&s;iderably in our favor. The profits of that trade have declined rapidly within the&s;e fifteen years, and the con&s;equence is, that we &s;ee no more of their gold in circulation. Fourthly, he affects to con&s;ider it as a great hard&s;hip, that a draught upon a banker &s;hould be paid in bank notes, as if it did not depend upon the choice of the party him&s;elf, to take notes, or &s;pecie, as he thought proper; or as if he might not carry his note to the Bank, and have it immediately changed into guineas. Bankers paid in Portugal coin, becau&s;e they had great quantities of it poured in upon them by their cu&s;tomers, and not becau&s;e there was any &s;carcity of guineas. Fifthly, a &s;ix-and-thirty, or a moidore, is as liable to be &s;weated as a guinea; but it is certain that in the &s;tate, in which they i&s;&s;ue from the mint in Portugal, they are worth more than what they pa&s;s for in tale; and it is notorious that &s;uch of tho&s;e pieces, as have not been filed or &s;weated, have been con&s;tantly bought up by the Jews and others, at a premium, and either melted down or exported. Sixthly, with re&s;pect to the &s;carcity of &s;ilver, the author &s;hould have known that, where there is a plenty of one of the precious metals in a nation, a &s;carcity of the other can only be accidental and temporary. In general, the price of &s;ilver in Europe mu&s;t always be higher than that of gold, in proportion to their re&s;pective value, becau&s;e there is a greater profit upon the exportation of &s;ilver to the Ea&s;t Indies. I ought to make an apology to the Engli&s;h reader, for taking any notice of the wild, extravagant fancies of this ill-informed, pa&s;&s;ionate writer. The&s;e few remarks however may help to undeceive foreigners, who in general know nothing of our affairs, and are ready to believe any thing. It is the policy of the French to endeavour to undermine our credit abroad, and this undoubtedly is an object that de&s;erves our attention. We are indebted to Mr. de Pinto for the zeal and &s;ucce&s;s with which he has counteracted their endeavours. As for the French them&s;elves, their &s;ituation entitles them to indulgence. The lo&s;ing game&s;ter may be allowed to con&s;ole him&s;elf with calumny and invective, in the mid&s;t of real humiliation and di&s;honor. Yet, when they affect to undervalue the &s;trength, credit, and re&s;ources of this country, their arguments, in effect, return again&s;t them&s;elves. If we are really in that degraded &s;tate, to which without doubt they would gladly reduce us, to what a deplorable condition mu&s;t the great empire of France be reduced, when &s;he &s;ubmits to receive the law from a kingdom le&s;s by one third in extent and population, overwhelmed with debt, enervated by luxury, and exhau&s;ted by extravagance!<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE> The author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> pretends that the Engli&s;h buy more than they &s;ell, and have done &s;o for a con&s;iderable time.

The &s;tronge&s;t proof that it is &s;o, would be the fal&s;ehood of the author's own conclu&s;ions, even where his ob&s;ervations might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been verified. Every man, who has the &s;lighte&s;t political knowledge of Europe, mu&s;t perceive how much he is mi&s;taken. Metaphy&s;ics, &s;up|ported by calculation, are the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and the mo&s;t fallacious. We lo&s;e our under&s;tanding by having too much of it, and, by knowing too many things, at la&s;t know nothing. Commerce is a game, and it is vain to play with people who have nothing to lo&s;e. To win <HI>always,</HI> with exclu&s;ion of every body el&s;e, is impo&s;&s;ible. Univer&s;al commerce is there|fore a mere chimera.

Their opulence is no more durable than a game&s;ter's luck, unle&s;s the riches of the &s;oil, and the political admini&s;tration, contribute to encourage indu&s;try, and to &s;upport the national commerce. In the natural order of things, the advantage may lie on the &s;ide of France. But, as it is the nature of &s;ilver and gold to circulate, riches, which give birth to luxury, fre|quently

turn to the account of indigent nations, and always to the account of trading nations. This &s;on of Opulence is the father of Poverty.

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are great abu&s;es in England with re&s;pect to the coin.

The greate&s;t inconvenience &s;eems to ari&s;e from the di&s;proportion between the coined money and the intrin&s;ic value of the metal. This di&s;proportion, according to Mr. Kar&s;&s;eboom, proceeds from a con&s;tant and &s;crupulous attachment to the proportion fixed by the act of the 43d of Eliza|beth. <NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot"><P>Coinage is a &s;ubject which the tran&s;lator by no means pretends to under|&s;tand.

If it did, the evil would be without remedy. The price of bullion ri&s;es or falls every day, according to the quantity imported, or the demand in the market. Now it is impo&s;&s;ible for the mint to follow the fluctuations of the price of bullion. The &s;tandard cannot be altered every day, and, if it could, the expence of recoinage would be in&s;upportable. The evil we complain of, with re&s;pect to &s;ilver coin, is inherent in the nature of the thing, and not capable of a direct remedy. A general recoinage, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the end propo&s;ed, would only be putting the public to a great expence, and making a pre&s;ent to the crucible of the difference between the real and nominal value of the coin. The indirect remedy is &s;low, but infallible. Encourage trade, promote indu&s;try and oeconomy. The balance of trade will then be univer&s;ally in our favor, and, in&s;tead of &s;eeing our coin melted down, we &s;hall &s;ee plenty of &s;ilver carried to the mint.

It has been thought, by per&s;ons of great knowledge, that prohibitions again&s;t exporting gold and &s;ilver are u&s;ele&s;s; and that, with money as with corn, &s;carcity is the natural effect of &s;uch prohibitions.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> The &s;carcity of &s;pecie on the Royal Exchange, mentioned by the author of the <HI>Bilan,</HI> frequently proceeds from temporary

But, as an individual, immen&s;ely rich, may find him&s;elf &s;hort of money, (his current ca&s;h being exhau&s;ted, perhaps in lucrative undertakings) the &s;ame thing may happen to a trading nation. The di&s;tre&s;s does not la&s;t long. A remedy is &s;oon applied by bills of exchange, &s;upported by real property; and it commonly happens that a &s;carcity is &s;ucceeded by a great abundance of &s;pecie. This has been con&s;tantly ob&s;erved. Let us hear what Mon&s;ieur de Mon|te&s;quieu &s;ays upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In the country of commerce, the money that di&s;appeared &s;uddenly, returns, becau&s;e the &s;tates that received it owe it. The &s;carcity or abundance, which varies the cour&s;e of exchange, is not a real, but a relative &s;carcity or abundance. When France, for example, has more need of a fund in Hol|land,
<PB N="70" REF="90">
than the Dutch have of a fund in France, money is then called cheap in France and &s;carce in Holland, and vice ver&s;&acirc;." He &s;ays, that "money is one merchandi&s;e more, which Europe receives by way of barter from America, and exports to India. Con&s;idering the metals as merchandi&s;e, a great quantity of gold and &s;ilver is advantageous. It is not &s;o, con&s;idering them as &s;igns, becau&s;e a plenty of them lowers their quality of &s;igns, which is in a great mea&s;ure founded upon their &s;carcity."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The exchange," he ob&s;erves in another place, having given men a &s;ingular facility in con|veying money from one country to another, money is no &s;ooner &s;carce in one place, but it flows in, on all quarters, from the places where it was plentiful. The fixing the rate depends upon a compound ratio of the total of things com|pared with the total of &s;igns, and varies as the accidents of commerce incline the balance one way or the other."</Q></P>
<P>According to Monte&s;quieu, all moveables, &s;uch as money, notes, bills of exchange, actions in public companies, &s;hips, &amp;c. are merchandi&s;es that belong to the whole world; the nation that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the greate&s;t &s;hare of the&s;e moveables is the riche&s;t. That great man knew the principle, but did not perceive the con&s;equences. When he &s;peaks of public funds, he mi&s;takes the nature of them. The object was beneath him, and e&s;caped his attention. He &s;ays in another place, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As money is the &s;ign of a thing, and repre&s;ents it, &s;o every thing is the &s;ign of money, and repre&s;ents it; and the &s;tate pro&s;pers, in proportion as, on one &s;ide, money is a true repre&s;entative of things, and as things in return are true repre&s;entatives of money; that is, when, according to their relative value, a man may have the one as &s;oon as he has the other."</Q> This
<PB N="71" REF="91">
is preci&s;ely the ca&s;e of the public debts, of which he &s;peaks &s;o differently in many parts of his works.</P>
<P>If the whole produce of commerce was contained in the amount of the territorial revenue, as the author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A refutation of this principle will be found in the third part of this work.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> what would become of Holland, who&s;e territorial revenue is almo&s;t all exhau&s;ted in &s;upporting the territory?</P>
<P>It co&s;ts the &s;tate more to keep the dykes and high roads in repair, than the revenue of the lands amounts to. Yet the produce of commerce and con&s;umption is immen&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding the parcimonious &s;pirit of the mechanic, who improves upon French &s;obriety, without the &s;ame good effect, for labor is dearer there than in France. Holland is another proof that an exclu&s;ive advantage in commerce is a chimera. Her profits ari&s;e from the opulence of her neighbours, who would &s;uffer in their turn, if any unhappy revolution were to annihilate the republic. It is the bridge of communication, the common mart, the &s;up|port of which is e&s;&s;ential to the trade of other powers. Whoever is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of actions, <HI>obligations</HI> &s;ecured by the &s;tate, annui|ties, or other &s;tock in England, converts them into money at one per cent. more or le&s;s, according to the market-price at Am&s;ter|dam or London. It is a great advantage to the Engli&s;h, that their &s;tocks are current on the exchange of both countries. It is to be wi&s;hed, that the &s;ame commerce were e&s;tabli&s;hed in favor of the French funds. Perhaps it might not be impracticable. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When this Treati&s;e was written, the French funds were more current than at pre&s;ent.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I have wandered a little from my &s;ubject to correct &s;ome mi&s;takes, into which the ingenious author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> has been led by Engli&s;h writers and others, whom I do not re&s;pect

<P>I think I have proved on one &s;ide, that the gold and &s;ilver with which Europe has been overflown &s;ince the di&s;covery of America, and on the other, that the augmentation of com|merce, by which the new world is &s;upplied with &s;o many commodities and manufactures of the old one, have occa&s;ioned a revolution in the political, moral, and civil &s;y&s;tem of Europe; that the&s;e metals again require new repre&s;entatives in their quality of &s;igns, becau&s;e the abundance of them has multiplied the things they repre&s;ent; that nothing contributes to &s;upport circulation more than the national debt of England; that it has increa&s;ed the numerary, and co-operated in the fixation of riches; that, without the creation of the&s;e funds, the three commercial powers would have le&s;s numerary wealth, and could not circulate money enough to an&s;wer the triple demand of commerce, finance, and luxury; that taxes return in part into the hand that pays them, and circulate with benefit to the public; that of cour&s;e they are not &s;o mi&s;chievous as it is pretended; that the debts of the &s;tate are very u&s;eful, up to a certain point; that they have their limits, beyond which they might become equally dangerous; that a &s;inking fund is e&s;&s;ential to credit, and nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate; that in time of peace there cannot be too much care taken to di&s;charge a part of the debt, but that it might be dangerous to pay it off entirely. (I think that a proportionate ma&s;s of paper &s;hould always be kept in circulation, on terms the lea&s;t burthen&s;ome to the &s;tate). That the greate&s;t operations depend upon credit. To be u&s;eful, it

mu&s;t flouri&s;h extremely; if not, it draws no more than the bucket of the Danaides. (Experience &s;hows that the traffic in the &s;tocks contributes greatly to &s;upport the credit and circula|tion of the public funds, and that without this traffic England never could have negotiated tho&s;e con&s;iderable loans, to which &s;he owes her a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;&s;es). That, to arrive at the &s;ame point, we ought, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to model our conduct upon theirs; conforming however, in the execution, to the re&s;pective principles of government. I have &s;hown that, if it were not for the India trade, money would have &s;unk &s;till lower in its quality of &s;ign; that a great part of it is recovered by individuals, who acquire riches in India, and bring them back to Europe; that the ob&s;ervations of the author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> upon the cour&s;e of exchange are not &s;olid; that the exchange is a fal&s;e barometer, a deceitful compa&s;s, unle&s;s attention be paid to all the circum&s;tances ob&s;erved by Mon&s;ieur de Monte&s;quieu; and that, in a word, the national debt has enriched the king|dom, increa&s;ed its numerary wealth, encouraged circulation, commerce, and indu&s;try, and procured the mo&s;t important &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war; that nothing but its being carried to exce&s;s can annihilate all the&s;e advantages; and that &s;uch exce&s;s may be prevented by means of the &s;inking fund, the re&s;ources of which &s;hall be more particularly explained in the Second Part.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. <HI>New Means of increa&s;ing the Sinking Fund of</HI> England, <HI>and paying off Part of the National Debt.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SINCE there has been a general improvement in knowledge, &s;ince all the world has taken a &s;hare in commerce, and &s;ince the principles of finance are no longer my&s;terious, nor confined to the adept, every thing may be reduced to calculation. Credit, which was formerly no more than a creature of the mind, <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Credit is more than a creature of the mind, and has always had a real exi&s;tence, though, like any other re&s;ource, it may be de&s;troyed by an injudicious exertion. Like the precious metal, who&s;e place it &s;upplies, credit may be extended ad infinitum; but as they both lo&s;e in &s;olidity what they gain in &s;urface, a breath of air is &s;ufficient to blow the golden leaf away.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> an idol wor&s;hipped through habit, has obtained a real exi&s;tence, may be acquired by &s;y&s;tem, lo&s;t by accident, and recovered by principle.

<P>England, with fewer apparent re&s;ources than France, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a more &s;plendid credit. <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Perhaps it might be more truly affirmed, that England, having a more brilliant credit, has therefore more re&s;ources than France.

contributes to it. Yet, if France had pur&s;ued the &s;ame princi|ples in the operations of her finances, the prejudice again&s;t her would have been partly removed. At the beginning of the war in 1755 the French funds wore a better appearance than the Engli&s;h. Far from &s;inking or giving way, the whole ma&s;s of paper &s;upported it&s;elf &s;urpri&s;ingly. The bare creation of a &s;inking fund had given a con&s;i&s;tence as well as a colouring to paper, and &s;ubdued the old prejudices, by which credit had been de&s;troyed. But the plan was not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered; the principles were not &s;ufficiently combined; accidents were not fore&s;een. I am per&s;uaded, that credit would have &s;upported it&s;elf longer, if, when the &s;inking fund was created, care had been taken to appri&s;e the public, that the di&s;charge of debt was to be &s;u&s;pended in time of war, with an a&s;&s;urance that this fund &s;hould then &s;erve as a collateral &s;ecurity for paying the intere&s;t; the exactne&s;s and punctuality of which &s;hould be inviolable, as it is in England. Every thing &s;hould have been done with the concurrence, and under the &s;anction, of the parliament. From a want of the&s;e formalities and precautions, they were &s;topped by rivulets when they had rivers to pa&s;s. In England the u&s;e of the &s;inking fund was more exten&s;ive. This machine of wax yielded to the impre&s;&s;ion of government, and was applied to the current expences of the war. The funds, by which the intere&s;t of the debt was &s;ecured, proceeded without interruption; they were &s;olid, &s;ufficient, and inviolable; no part of the principal could be demanded. In the mid&s;t of a &s;torm, government glided upon a &s;mooth river, while in France they were carried, away by a torrent. The French &s;inking fund di&s;appeared like a phantom, and credit was annihilated at the moment it was mo&s;t wanted. This could not have happened if a &s;olid, inviolable &s;ecurity had been a&s;&s;igned for the &s;eparate

intere&s;t of each loan by a particular tax created, as in England, at the time the loan was made. In France the intere&s;t upon all the loans is confounded, and charged upon the <HI>Aides, Gabelles,</HI> <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Gabelles</HI> &s;ignify the duties on &s;alt, levied within the kingdom of France. The whole internal commerce of &s;alt is in the hands of the king, who fixes the price, and directs the &s;ale and di&s;tribution, by means of his farmers, and under the juri&s;diction of officers created expre&s;sly for this branch of the revenue. The whole kingdom is not equally &s;ubject to what they call the Gro&s;&s;e Gabelle. Be&s;ides the exemption which particular per&s;ons are &s;till allowed in virtue of their offices, &s;everal provinces of Old France, and in general all the frontier provinces, conquered or ceded to the crown in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t century, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Pa&iuml;s de Franc-Sal&eacute;. In the&s;e countries, the duty on &s;alt is lighter, the king taking it on the footing on which he found it e&s;tabli&s;hed at the time of the acqui&s;ition. But as the other taxes are heavier, the inhabitants lo&s;e as much on one &s;ide as they gain on the other.</P>
<P>Nothing can be conceived more iniquitous and oppre&s;&s;ive than the Gro&s;&s;e Gabelle, as well with re&s;pect to the quantum of the tax, as the mode of levying it. Salt, which ought to be one of the cheape&s;t articles of con&s;umption, is, by various tricks and contrivances, made &s;o dear to the confumer, that, notwith&s;tanding its univer&s;al u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity, the government is obliged to force the &s;ale of it by compul&s;ory regulations. In con&s;equence of bad management, the produce to the king bears no proportion to the enormous expence of collection. As the duty is not equal in all parts of the kingdom, the king is obliged to maintain an army of cu&s;tom-officers to prevent the tran&s;portation of it from one province to another; and as it is al&s;o exce&s;&s;ively heavy, the pea&s;ant and the poor in general do not con&s;ume the tenth part of what they would do, if the commodity were cheap. In the year 1707, Mar&s;hal Vauban &s;ays, that the dearne&s;s of &s;alt had created a kind of famine in the kingdom, &s;en&s;ibly felt by the lower rank of people, who, for want of &s;alt, were deprived of the means of pickling, particularly pork, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. With the &s;evere&s;t oeconomy, they had not enough for daily u&s;e. The difference of price in the different provinces &s;ends a multitude of &s;mugglers to the gallies. In tho&s;e parts where every individual is compelled to take a certain quantity of &s;alt (which among the poor is u&s;ually more than they can afford to pay for) they are not allowed to make u&s;e of what they &s;ave in one year, to &s;erve them for the next. This cruel and ab&s;urd regulation expo&s;es the people to all &s;orts of vexations on the part of the king's officers, who ran&s;ack every corner of their hou&s;es, in hopes of di&s;covering &s;alt not declared, and where they find none, often bring it them&s;elves, and pretend to have found it &s;ecreted, in order to vex and oppre&s;s tho&s;e again&s;t whom they have any private pique. The &s;el d'impo&s;t, or annual quantity, which every ma&s;ter of a family is compelled to buy at the king's magazine, is computed at the rate of one minot, or four bu&s;hels, for fourteen per&s;ons, including infants. This &s;alt can only be employed in the daily u&s;es of the family. They are forbid to u&s;e it in any of the con&s;iderable articles of pickling.</P>
<P>In the provinces, where the people are not compelled to take a limited quantity, they u&s;e as little as po&s;&s;ible them&s;elves, and give none to their cattle; for want of which they are weak, &s;piritle&s;s, and unhealthy; and the duty of cour&s;e is incon|&s;iderable. It would be endle&s;s to enumerate the particular abu&s;es, with which the whole plan of the Gabelles is attended. Fraud again&s;t the king, and oppre&s;&s;ion to the &s;ubject, are the natural con&s;equence of every arbitrary &s;y&s;tem of taxation, where no proportion is ob&s;erved between the quantum of the tax and the nature of the commodity, nor any regard had to the condition and means of that rank of the people, on whom the chief weight of it mu&s;t fall. Tyranny in general defeats its own purpo&s;e. The people are oppre&s;&s;ed, and the revenue &s;uffers.</P>

<P>After the&s;e facts, &s;hall it be &s;aid that the operation of a &s;inking fund mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended in time of war, as contradictory to, and incompatible with, the new loans which the &s;ervice may require? I am far from thinking &s;o. The principle may be &s;oftened, and greater advantages drawn from it. In France, it was only the form that was defective, and this defect prevailed through all the operations of her finances. In France I have often in&s;i&s;ted upon the utility of a permanent &s;inking fund, both in peace and war. The principles I went upon were not entirely rejected. Some u&s;e was made of them; but they were neither carried to their extent, nor, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;trictly adhered to. I am of opinion, that all appearances might have been

&s;aved, and an equal quantity of debt extingui&s;hed, by reducing the intere&s;t of the redeemable annuities, or paying off tho&s;e who might not &s;ubmit to the reduction.</P>
<P>In the year 1750, the Engli&s;h government, &s;upported by peace, by an abundance of money, by credit, and a good admini&s;|tration, was able to reduce all the four per cent. annuities, of which there was an immen&s;e quantity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">&pound;. 57, 703, 475: 6: 4&frac12;</NOTE> to three, offering at the &s;ame time to pay off tho&s;e who &s;hould refu&s;e their con&s;ent to this arrangement. Government even puni&s;hed tho&s;e per&s;ons who refu&s;ed, or he&s;itated, by declaring that they, who did not come in within a &s;hort limited time, &s;hould be immediately paid off; whereas the &s;ub&s;cribers &s;hould enjoy an intere&s;t of three and a half per cent. for &s;even years longer. By the&s;e means few people de&s;ired to be paid off. The opportunity was favorable, mea&s;ures were well taken, and there were &s;ome millions in re&s;erve. The Bank, India, and South-Sea com|panies, had been appri&s;ed of the &s;cheme, and gained over by government, together with &s;ome moneyed men, who had nothing better to do with their money. So that an operation, which in theory &s;eemed difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, was com|pleted with ea&s;e, and wonderful &s;ucce&s;s. In &s;ome ca&s;es it is ea&s;ier to execute than to conceive. It is certain that, with five millions only, when credit is well managed, the intere&s;t of fifty may be reduced, yet without compelling any body, paying off &s;ome few, and offering to pay off the re&s;t. Every thing depends upon the opportunity, and method of u&s;ing it. France was upon the point of being able to &s;ei&s;e a like opportunity; but having neglected to make u&s;e of it, they have &s;ince been obliged to have recour&s;e to le&s;s plau&s;ible and le&s;s honorable expedients. The example I refer to, is a di&s;tingui&s;hed fact known by the
<PB N="80" REF="100">
whole world, and might have been followed with advantage. But the moment is pa&s;t, and cannot be recalled.</P>
<P>Let us turn to England, where the fire of Ve&s;ta has never been extingui&s;hed. The public &s;aith, with regard to the credit of the funds, has never been violated, or &s;uffered the lea&s;t diminution. I have &s;hown by what means credit has been &s;o long &s;upported, and proved that the national debt has enriched the nation by increa&s;ing its numerary. I have unfolded the prin|ciples of circulation, together with the utility and the nece&s;&s;ity of the funds; acknowledging at the &s;ame time, that there was a maximum which mu&s;t be avoided, and that, if wars were to &s;ucceed each other, without a con&s;iderable di&s;charge of debt in the intervals of peace, the machine might give way, and draw the ruin of the kingdom along with it. For this rea|&s;on, I affirm, that England &s;tands in need of an auxiliary, per|manent, &s;inking fund, to operate in time of war, as well as peace. Great advantages would re&s;ult from it, both to the public and to government. Let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that, after &s;ome years of peace, the ma&s;s of the national debt &s;hould be dimini&s;hed by &s;everal millions; that when it was reduced, for example, to &s;eventy or eighty millions only, which is very practicable, a war &s;hould commence; and that government, during the war, &s;hould continue to pay off <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><P>With great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the author, his idea of paying off a million and a half at par, even in time of peace, when &s;tocks are only eleven or twelve per cent. under it, is out of all rea&s;on, and would be con&s;idered as little &s;hort of madne&s;s in this country. It would be making a pre&s;ent of eleven or twelve pounds to every proprietor of a hundred, who might have the good fortune to be fir&s;t paid off. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ugge&s;t in what manner that advantage might be di&s;tributed. The pur&s;uing &s;uch a plan in time of war would be &s;till more wa&s;teful and unrea|&s;onable. To pay off a debt at three per cent. with one hand, while government is obliged to borrow money at four or five per cent. with the other, leads directly ad ab&s;urdum. You pay off a creditor whom you are not obliged to pay off; you do it at a time when you want money mo&s;t; the &s;ame money is lent you again at a higher intere&s;t than it &s;tood at before, and you mu&s;t lay a new tax upon the people to pay the intere&s;t of the new loan. This, I pre&s;ume, will not bear an argument.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on of great abilities propo&s;es any thing that &s;eems to carry an in&s;ur|mountable objection upon the face of it, inferior men ought to &s;u&s;pect their own want of apprehen&s;ion, and confe&s;s that they are more likely to mi&s;under&s;tand, than he to mi&s;take. A very able Engli&s;h writer affirms, that when money is wanted for the public &s;ervice, the difference, between borrowing a million and taking it out of the &s;inking fund, is infinitely in favor of the former. Upon this I ob&s;erve, fir&s;t, that the laying a new tax on the people is an objection to his &s;cheme, to which he does not give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer; yet, without a new tax, he cannot avail him&s;elf of the compound intere&s;t of the debt he di&s;charges; and how new taxes are to be rai&s;ed in this country to any con&s;iderable amount, is a que&s;tion much more ea&s;ily an&s;wered by projectors in the clo&s;et, than by mini&s;ters in the cabinet. Secondly, his &s;uppo&s;ition, that when you pay off a million of the four per cents. at par, you can immediately borrow an equal &s;um at the &s;ame intere&s;t, &s;eems totally gratuitous and unwarrantable. As at pre&s;ent there are no four per cents. redeemable, let us apply his propo&s;ition to the three per cents. With re&s;pect to the argument it is the &s;ame thing. The medium price in time of war may fairly be taken at &s;eventy-five pounds. The que&s;tion then is, whether paying off a million at par will rai&s;e the price of &s;tocks twenty-five per cent. If not, it is &s;elf-evident, that government cannot borrow a million at three per cent. for the current &s;ervice. If the medium price of a debt of a hundred and thirty millions be &s;eventy-five per cent. the proportionate price of a hundred and twenty-nine millions would be only &pound;. 75 11 6 6/12. But to &s;peak largely, let us &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;tocks would ri&s;e to eighty, which &s;urely is an allowance beyond all probability. The re&s;ult of the operation would then be, that govern|ment to-day pays off a million at three per cent. and borrows it again to-morrow at three and three quarters, without reckoning the value of the douceur that mu&s;t be given to the &s;ub&s;criber to tempt him to prefer the new &s;ub&s;cription to the old funds.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time I do not mean to deny the u&s;e and benefit of a permanent &s;inking fund to operate in war as well as peace, with this &s;uppo&s;ition always, that the utmo&s;t advantage is taken of the low price of &s;tocks, and that taxes be not &s;o multiplied as to defeat them&s;elves. The &s;tate then makes a compound intere&s;t of the &s;um it applies to the di&s;charge of debt, whereas it pays only a &s;imple intere&s;t for the &s;um it borrows; and it is to be pre&s;umed, that the people would chearfully &s;ubmit to &s;ome increa&s;e of taxes, provided they &s;aw the produce of the &s;inking fund <HI>prudently</HI> as well as &s;trictly applied to the di&s;charge of debt.</P>
<P>It is highly to the honor of the Noble Lord now at the head of the trea&s;ury, that the idea of di&s;counting the public debt was fir&s;t adopted in his admini&s;tration. The &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t attempt in 1771, will undoubtedly encourage him to per&s;evere in the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, whenever the &s;ituation of public affairs will admit of it. Speculative or fanciful objections are not to be regarded, when the public is manife&s;tly benefited, and the creditor, who is the party immediately concerned, is not only &s;atisfied with the terms offered him, but eager to &s;ub&s;cribe to them. A &s;cheme of this nature has a double edge. It either rai&s;es the price of &s;tocks, or gives the public the advantage of di&s;charging its debts at a low price. The very decline of public credit increa&s;es the power of re&s;toring it.</P>
<P>To this plan there &s;eems to be but one po&s;&s;ible improvement. If, after an impartial con&s;ideration, it &s;hould be thought worthy of trial, the immen&s;e importance of the object will, it is to be hoped, unite all parties in promoting its &s;ucce&s;s. To thwart or embarra&s;s a plan evidently calculated to &s;erve the public, without the po&s;&s;ibility of an&s;wering any mini&s;terial purpo&s;e, would di&s;grace a patriotic oppo|&s;ition. Every public-&s;pirited mea&s;ure &s;hould have the privilege of holy ground, on which, amid&s;t the war of parties, it &s;hould be deemed &s;acrilege to commit ho&s;tilities. The general idea of making the utmo&s;t advantage of the low price of the funds, in favor of the public, is obvious enough, and has often occurred to others, though no plan of this kind has yet been &s;eriou&s;ly attempted. It is pro|po&s;ed, that the legi&s;lature &s;hould, from year to year, intru&s;t a committee of the hou&s;e of commons with a power of purcha&s;ing &s;tock for the u&s;e of the public at the market price, at &s;uch times, and in &s;uch proportions, as they &s;hould think proper, to the amount of the available &s;urplus of the &s;inking fund. There might be difficulties in the execution, as there are in every new enterpri&s;e; but they would not be in&s;urmountable. In theory I &s;ee no &s;olid objection. The choice of the committee ought to be determined by one at lea&s;t out of three qualifications, <HI>high office, great property,</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal character.</HI> It is e&s;&s;ential to the execution of &s;uch a &s;cheme, that no &s;tep be taken without the concurrence of government, repre&s;ented by &s;ome of its principal mini&s;ters. The private property of the com|mittee would be a &s;ecurity again&s;t fraud and mi&s;management; at the &s;ame time that the per&s;onal reputation of the managers would give credit to the &s;cheme, and engage the confidence of the public. There are but two grounds on which it might be oppo&s;ed with any appearance of argument, and the&s;e &s;eem rather topics of declamation than of &s;olid objection. It will be &s;aid, that it is di&s;graceful to a great nation to buy up its own debts in the market at a lower rate than that at which they were contracted. It will al&s;o be &s;aid, that the committee will have it in their power to rai&s;e or &s;ink the &s;tocks at plea&s;ure, and by that means to buy and &s;ell for their private advantage. To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer, that there is no di&s;grace where there is no inju&s;tice; and that, where no violence is offered to the creditor, he cannot be &s;aid to &s;uffer inju&s;tice. Volenti non fit injuria. It is in his option to &s;ell or not, as he thinks proper. If he &s;ells, it mu&s;t be totally indifferent to him whether government or a private per&s;on be the purcha&s;er. Far from being injured by government's acting in competition with other purcha&s;ers, the value of his pro|perty would inevitably be improved by it. The objection on the &s;core of national dignity mu&s;t at this time be thought particularly frivolous, after the &s;ucce&s;s of the plan for the year 1771. In that in&s;tance government paid off a debt of a <HI>hundred</HI> with <HI>ninety;</HI> and, though the mode be a little different, the effect is the &s;ame. The man who voluntarily &s;ells his &s;tock to government at eighty-eight, is as much a &s;ub&s;criber to this &s;cheme as he who &s;ub&s;cribed it in at ninety was a &s;ub|&s;criber to the other; nor can there be a doubt that, if all the three per cents. were at once paid off at eighty-eight, the pre&s;ent body of proprietors would receive a greater &s;um than their &s;tock originally co&s;t them. In &s;hort, the circum&s;tances of the nation are &s;uch as ju&s;tify any mea&s;ures tending to le&s;&s;en the incumbrance of the public debt, except violence to the creditor, or breach of parliamentary faith. Genero&s;ity at this &s;ea&s;on to the public creditor would but ill agree with the debtor's &s;ituation; and, after all, who is the public creditor? A per&s;on, or number of per&s;ons, who, when money has been wanted, have taken every po&s;&s;ible advantage of the di&s;tre&s;s or nece&s;&s;ities of government. To the &s;econd objection I an&s;wer, that no great operation what&s;oever can be executed without placing a confidence &s;ome|where. This confidence would be annual, and &s;ubject to a parliamentary revi&s;ion. But it is un&s;air and unwarrantable to &s;uppo&s;e, that ten or twelve gentlemen, of the fir&s;t con&s;equence in the kingdom, of different parties, views, and connexions, would enter into a combination (for without it they could do nothing) to avail them&s;elves of a fluctuation in the price of &s;tocks; and, if they did, the fluctuations would not be great or quick enough to enable them to do much mi&s;chief. It may be added that, as their only bu&s;ine&s;s would be to buy, they could only rai&s;e and never &s;ink the market price of the commodity; and it would be ea&s;y to re&s;train them from inve&s;ting large &s;ums at once. On the other hand, the po&s;itive advantages of the &s;cheme would be numerous and important.</P>
<P>The committee would buy up &s;tock on better terms than could be obtained by a &s;ub&s;cription, becau&s;e they would buy at the current price, and always prefer that &s;tock that happened to be lowe&s;t in the market. Together with the principal they would purcha&s;e the growing intere&s;t, which might go in aid of their fund, and be reinve&s;ted in the purcha&s;e of capital &s;tock; and very &s;mall &s;ums might be inve&s;ted with the &s;ame proportionate advantage as great ones; &s;ometimes perhaps with greater advantages. The continued expectation of the committee's inve&s;tment would keep up the price of &s;tocks, as it would take place by degrees; and no man could po&s;itively know when their whole fund was exhau&s;ted. In this re&s;pect the effect of a &s;ub&s;cription is momentary.</P>
<P>But of all the advantages attending &s;uch a &s;cheme, the mo&s;t material is, that it is to be carried through without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a lottery. The con&s;tant u&s;e of this expedient in time of peace is like the daily u&s;e of wine to young men. In one in&s;tance we anticipate the re&s;ources of war and di&s;tre&s;s; in the other, we anticipate the comforts of decrepitude and old age. In both we rai&s;e a momentary &s;upply of fal&s;e &s;pirits, at the expence of health and con&s;titution. Without entering minutely into the numberle&s;s objections again&s;t lotteries, it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve in general, that &s;ince every &s;pecies of gaming is de&s;tructive of indu&s;try, that game mu&s;t be mo&s;t &s;o that offers the greate&s;t temptation to the lower rank, who, for the benefit of the &s;tate, as well as their own, &s;hould con&s;tantly be employed. At any other game a great profit is not expected from &s;ucce&s;s. In a lottery, the man who buys but the &s;ixteenth of a ticket, fixes his eye upon the great prize, and expects to make his fortune. The lottery offices, by accommodating their &s;chemes to every man's circum&s;tances, lay all the laboring rank of people under a grievous contri|bution, and extort a tax even from wretches who pay nothing to the &s;tate. Great mini&s;ters cannot know or conceive to what extent the&s;e abu&s;es are carried, nor how much they tend to corrupt the morals of the people. But great mini&s;ters &s;hould know at lea&s;t, that lo&s;s of indu&s;try in the &s;ubject is lo&s;s of revenue to the &s;tate. Even an intermi&s;&s;ion of a year or two might have this good effect, that a lottery would appear with &s;o much the more novelty, and be filled by tho&s;e who have money enough to purcha&s;e entire tickets. Other abu&s;es might be corrected by the legi&s;lature.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE> annually a

They will be able to unfold the infinite advantages, that might re&s;ult from it to the Engli&s;h nation. Perhaps it may be no more than a chimera of theory. Let us try whether it might not be reali&s;ed in practice.</P>
<P>To proceed methodically, let us, once again, con&s;ider the national debt and &s;inking fund analytically. Let us weigh the two objects, and reduce them to their exact dimen&s;ions. It has been &s;hown that, properly &s;peaking, it is only the intere&s;t that can be a burthen to government. The principal is not de|mandable. With re&s;pect to government, it may almo&s;t be &s;aid not to exi&s;t, though it has &s;erved and enriched the public. Yet, if this principle were abu&s;ed, taxes would be perpetuated, and multiply; the weight of the funds would break the &s;prings of
<PB N="86" REF="106">
circulation; credit might fail, and the whole edifice fall to the ground. I affirm that this period is &s;till very di&s;tant. If it were near at hand, the mi&s;chief perhaps would admit of no remedy. Con&s;idering the debt as it &s;tands, it is evident that, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e increa&s;e of capital debt &s;ince the death of Queen Anne, the burthen immediately falling on the public has not increa&s;ed in the &s;ame proportion. The nation has continued to borrow &s;ums, the intere&s;t of which &s;he would have been unable to di&s;charge, if means had not been taken, con&s;i&s;tently with ju&s;tice and good faith, to reduce the rate of intere&s;t; and, although the &s;inking &s;und (compo&s;ed of the &s;urpluses of taxes appropriated to pay the intere&s;t, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by voluntary reductions of intere&s;t, to which the creditors con|&s;ented rather than be paid off) has not produced all the effect that might have been expected from &s;o wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary an in&s;titution, yet it is certain that con&s;iderable &s;ums have been paid off, and that public credit has been &s;upported by the expectation of a con&s;tant annual reimbur&s;ement. A &s;inking fund increa&s;es in proportion as it is employed. The progre&s;&s;ive accumulation of annual intere&s;t &s;aved by every di&s;charge of debt, and united to the growing capital, in a few years pro|duces a prodigious fund, let the commencement of it, or &s;avings upon the fir&s;t payments, have been ever &s;o incon&s;iderable. The geometrical progre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a fund is immen&s;e, and a&s;toni&s;hes the imagination. It is a &s;hallow &s;tream that becomes a river as it flows. It is true however that, to avail them&s;elves of this progre&s;&s;ion, the Engli&s;h have been obliged to continue the taxes, appropriated to pay the intere&s;t of old loans, after the principal was di&s;charged. I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter of the means of le&s;&s;ening this inconvenience.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="107">
The &s;inking fund was much more con&s;iderable than it is, and amounted to above three millions &s;terling. But it has been charged with eight hundred thou&s;and pounds a year to &s;up|port the civil li&s;t, <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">As the &s;everal duties, appropriated to the &s;upport of the civil li&s;t, are now carried into, and made part of, the aggregate fund, it is but ju&s;t that this fund &s;hould fir&s;t make good the charge of the civil li&s;t, before the &s;urplus or any part of it is carried to the &s;inking fund. As the above duties produce more than the limited &s;um of Eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, which his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to accept for the &s;upport of his civil government, the difference is a con|&s;iderable improvement to the &s;inking fund.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> and to make good the deficiencies of all the appropriated taxes, as well as to &s;ecure the intere&s;t and principal of the unfunded debt; which is but ju&s;t. I leave it to the Engli&s;h to calculate to what &s;um the clear applicable pro|duce of their &s;inking fund, as it &s;tands at pre&s;ent, may amount. It is certain that if, after the fir&s;t year, it were every year &s;ucce&s;&s;ively augmented with the intere&s;t of the debt paid off, conformably to the nature of its in&s;titution, we &s;hould &s;ee a prodigious increa&s;e of its power at the end of a dozen years. If at that time (I &s;peak always hypothetically) the di&s;charge of the old debt was continued in proportion to the power of the fund, the price of &s;tocks could never fall, becau&s;e the quantity being dimini&s;hed, and con&s;ined to fewer hands, every creditor would have a chance of being &s;oon paid at par. New loans might then with ea&s;e be negotiated on moderate terms, and with a trifling douceur to the &s;ub&s;criber. But an operation of this kind, in the pre&s;ent enfeebled &s;tate of the &s;inking fund, would be too tedious. The uncertain continuance of peace, the clamour of oppo&s;ition, and the enormous ma&s;s of the debt, con|&s;tantly repre&s;ented as a bugbear, make an impre&s;&s;ion too &s;trong to agree with &s;o &s;low a remedy. Some operation like that of the
<PB N="88" REF="108">
year 1750 is wanted, brilliant in appearance, and rapid in its effect, by which all the phantoms, that undermine public credit, and &s;pread unea&s;ine&s;s among the people, might at once be put to flight.</P>
<P>The following, for in&s;tance, is an operation, by which I con|ceive twelve millions and a half of the ma&s;s of the national debt might be cancelled, that is, they might be converted into a fund &s;o con&s;tituted as to di&s;charge it&s;elf, by applying 527, 500l. a year out of the &s;inking fund for a certain number of years, part of which &s;um would be gradually recovered every year. The method I propo&s;e, would be to open a &s;ub&s;cription for creating life annuities <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot"><P>Before we enter into the general que&s;tion of the benefit or di&s;advantage of converting a part of the capital debt into life annuities, it may be proper to take notice of the defects and inaccuracy of the author's &s;cheme, as they appear upon the face of it. He propo&s;es that the four per cents. or three per cents. &s;hall be received at par; and that &s;ub&s;criptions in money &s;hall be received indi&s;criminately with &s;tock. In the fir&s;t place it is clear, that no money would be &s;ub&s;cribed; nor indeed does he reckon upon it. But it is equally certain, that none of the re|deemable four per cents. would have been &s;ub&s;cribed. If a proprietor of a four per cent. annuity intended to change it into a life annuity of &s;even and a half, he would of cour&s;e &s;ell it, and buy &s;tock at three per cent. and &s;ub&s;cribe the latter, pocketing the difference between the market price of the two &s;tocks. The calcu|lation therefore requires an amendment. As no &s;tock, but the three per cents. would be &s;ub&s;cribed, the &s;inking fund mu&s;t contribute a larger &s;um than the author &s;uppo&s;es to pay the life annuities. The intere&s;t of twelve millions and a half at three per cent. is only 375, 000l. con&s;equently the &s;um taken in the fir&s;t year out of the &s;inking fund would be 562, 500l. This however is only an error of calculation ea&s;ily rectified. Another much more material objection is, that, by receiving the three per cents. at par, when in the market they could only be &s;old at eighty-&s;even or eighty-eight, the author makes a pre&s;ent of twelve or thirteen per cent. to every &s;ub&s;criber, in addition to the life annuity. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to remark how extravagant and unthrifty a bargain this would be for the public.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t great advantage, which the author propo&s;es by converting a portion of the debt into life annuities, would be the taking &s;uch a quantity of &s;tock at once out of the market, which of cour&s;e would rai&s;e the value of the remainder. He conceives that, if the average price of the three per cents. be eighty-&s;even, when the whole debt is one hundred and thirty millions, an operation that paid off, or relieved the market of &s;ixteen millions nine hundred thou&s;and pounds (which is thirteen per cent. upon the whole debt) ought to rai&s;e the price of &s;tocks to par; and this is an advantage which he thinks cannot be purcha&s;ed too dear. The &s;econd advantage he expects from life annuities, is the increa&s;e of con&s;umption and expence, which ultimately turns to the improvement of the revenue. A man who&s;e annuity is rai&s;ed from three pounds to &s;even and a half, contributes, by his expence, more than double what he did, to the taxes upon every article of con|&s;umption; and the &s;tate by this means recovers a con&s;iderable part of the additional annuity. Perhaps al&s;o it may de&s;erve the attention of a mere financier, that in|crea&s;ing the means of luxury tends to &s;horten the lives of the annuitants, who&s;e annuities fall in &s;o much the &s;ooner, and improve the &s;inking fund. Upon this principle, the value of an apoplexy might be computed, and a general indige&s;tion be con&s;idered as one of the re&s;ources of the &s;tate. The probable mortality among the annuitants has been &s;eriou&s;ly reckoned upon, in France, as a good argument in favor of granting life annuities. The third advantage to be expected from them is, that whatever portion of the &s;inking fund is &s;et apart for this &s;ervice, cea&s;es to be in the di&s;po&s;ition of parliament, and con&s;equently is not liable to be mi&s;applied.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, the objections to life annuities are numerous and important. Fir&s;t, they are a check to indu&s;try, and an en|couragement to idlene&s;s, by enabling the annuitant to live upon his income. In England, the cla&s;s of people who do nothing is &s;ufficiently &s;tocked. Secondly, they are a check to marriage and population, becau&s;e they ex|hau&s;t all the re&s;ources of the individual in &s;ecuring an affluent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for him&s;elf, and leave no provi&s;ion for po&s;terity. Thirdly, they are expen&s;ive and injudicious, merely as a mea&s;ure of finance, becau&s;e none but the be&s;t lives would be given in. An aged or infirm per&s;on can make more than &s;even and a half per cent. by &s;inking his capital. Doctor Price has demon&s;trated that, if the &s;ame annual &s;um, which mu&s;t be &s;et apart for paying the additional annuity, were applied as far as it would go, together with the &s;avings of intere&s;t, to pay off principal debt <HI>at par,</HI> it would di&s;charge more than double the quantity of debt that would be extingui&s;hed by the falling-in of the life annuities in a given period. This objection is fatal, and makes it unnece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on any others.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the appropriation of a large portion of the &s;inking fund, in order to take it, as much as po&s;&s;ible, out of the di&s;po&s;ition of parliament; it is to be ob&s;erved that, by carrying our di&s;tru&s;t in parliament to an extreme, the nation may be deprived of a great re&s;ource upon the approach of &s;ome critical emergency, when money at any rate mu&s;t be had, to &s;ave the &s;tate. Taxed and loaded as we are, the mini&s;ter has by no means a plentiful choice of re&s;ources before him; and &s;up|po&s;ing the &s;inking fund as &s;trictly approprrated to the di&s;charge of principal, as the other funds are to pay the intere&s;t of debt, it concerns the public creditor very nearly, to con&s;ider in what way parliament is to rai&s;e an extraordinary &s;upply in &s;uch a moment of di&s;tre&s;s, as may threaten the &s;afety of the commonwealth. In one ca&s;e there would be a temporary mi&s;application of a fund intended to reduce the capital debt; in the other there would be no remedy, but applying part of the intere&s;t to the current &s;ervice. The election then propo&s;ed to the public creditor is, whether he would have the payment of his principal debt deferred, or run a very manife&s;t hazard of a reduction of intere&s;t. Be&s;ides this, if we look back to facts, we are not warranted to &s;u&s;pect, that parliament will not continue to apply the &s;inking fund, in &s;ome tolerable degree, to the payment of debt. They have done much more than the author pretends to do with his life annuities, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there have been con&s;iderable mi&s;applications of the &s;inking fund, and that with better management a much greater portion of debt might have been di&s;charged<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE> at &s;even and a half per cent. and

The intere&s;t of the twelve millions and a half thus di&s;charged, viz. of three millions and a half at four per cent. and nine millions at three per cent. would increa&s;e the &s;inking fund in the &s;um of &pound;.410,000 a year, and with the help of &pound;.527,500 taken from the &s;inking fund, would pay the life annuities without a new tax.

The &s;urplus of intere&s;t di&s;per&s;ed through the public would in part return into the old funds, where the annuitants ve&s;t their &s;avings. As the ma&s;s of &s;tock dimini&s;hes, the price ri&s;es. Credit acquires new &s;trength, and the formidable body of the old debt being reduced, the circulation of it would be &s;o much the le&s;s liable to be embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>

By this &s;cheme it is po&s;&s;ible to extingui&s;h twenty-five millions of principal debt, converting them into annuities, which gra|dually di&s;charge them&s;elves, and applying only a part of the &s;inking fund. The root of this fund would &s;till be pre&s;erved, with a new produce from year to year, and &s;oon recover its original condition by the falling-in of the life annuities. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that as &s;oon as the ma&s;s of life annuities is annihilated, the &s;um of &pound;.527,500 is re&s;tored to the &s;inking fund. The recovery of this &s;um would begin to be felt even in the fir&s;t few years, con&s;idering the multitude of annuitants, and the great ma&s;s of the &s;ub&s;cription.

<P>Nothing in my opinion could be more effectual, nor le&s;s bur|then&s;ome, towards creating an auxiliary and permanent &s;ink|ing fund, than a tax upon collateral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions. <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot"><P>Good u&s;e might be made of this idea of a tax upon collateral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions.

Fir&s;t, its being univer&s;ally adopted as a tax &s;ince the time of the Romans, proves nothing with re&s;pect to the right which a nation has to depart from its engagements to its creditors. Secondly, the mildne&s;s of the tax depends upon the quantum, and does not of it&s;elf ju&s;tify the principle. Thirdly, the nation, as debtor, is party again&s;t its creditors. The con&s;ent of the nation therefore, repre&s;ented or expre&s;&s;ed by parliament, would not ju&s;tify a violation of &s;pecific agreements with the public creditor. If it would, the national debt might &s;oon be reduced to nothing. Fourthly, an exemption in favor of foreigners, be&s;ides the difficulty, not to &s;ay the impo&s;&s;ibility of di&s;tingui&s;hing foreign property, would be highly unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t.

It might be continued no longer than till the debt &s;hould be reduced to &s;eventy millions &s;terling; or it might be continued for ever, and the re&s;pective taxes, rai&s;ed to pay the intere&s;t of loans, might be aboli&s;hed as fa&s;t as the &s;everal loans were paid off.

<P>I know there is &s;till a more &s;imple method to create a new &s;inking fund, or to give a con&s;iderable increa&s;e to the old one; I mean by an equal land tax. It is admitted in England that, if the land tax were upon a ju&s;t and equal footing, it would produce double what it does. But is there patrioti&s;m enough to &s;ubmit to a new a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment? I que&s;tion it. Yet nece&s;&s;ity, fear,
<PB N="95" REF="115">
and policy, may have an influence upon hearts the lea&s;t patriotic. To &s;upport the &s;trength of my a&s;&s;ertions it is &s;ufficient to have &s;hown, that re&s;ources are not wanting, and that with a wi&s;e admini&s;tration, a well-con&s;idered &s;y&s;tem, and a careful oeconomy, (the mo&s;t important, though in England the mo&s;t neglected article of all) this national debt, which is the &s;ubject of &s;o much clamor, is in its own nature very different from what it has been repre&s;ented, and capable, in point of quantity, of a con|&s;iderable diminution; that it depends upon the Engli&s;h nation, not only to obviate the bad con&s;equences of their debt, but to render it &s;till more u&s;eful to credit and circulation, by preventing an exce&s;&s;ive accumulation, which in time might be fatal.</P>
<P>The &s;trong remon&s;trances made by the French parliaments on the &s;ubject of taxes during the war, though filled with &s;ublime reflections worthy of tho&s;e venerable bodies, contributed not a little to the diminution of public credit, and to the low price to which all the royal funds were reduced. This could not fail of greatly embarra&s;&s;ing every mea&s;ure of finance, and perplexing the mini&s;try in their military operations. The writings of per&s;ons, who oppo&s;e government in England, on the &s;ubject of the national debt, have contributed to &s;ink the price of &s;tocks ten per cent. below par, and laid a con&s;tant check on every operation of finance. Yet the&s;e writings are of a nature widely different from the remon&s;trances of the parliaments. The authors are, for the mo&s;t part, apo&s;tles without mi&s;&s;ion; and for one paper written in good earne&s;t to inform the nation, and charitably to warn it again&s;t real danger, there are ten that proceed from mere ill humor. The former are excu&s;eable at lea&s;t, if not prai&s;eworthy. The others have no plea&s;ure, but in di&s;covering the pretended weakne&s;s of their country. They

make no &s;cruple of pro&s;tituting that country which is their common mother, without any u&s;e, and merely for their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Anti-mini&s;terial writers have clamored loudly again&s;t the mi&s;application of the &s;inking fund, and at government's having lately departed, in &s;ome in&s;tances, from the invariable rule of appropriating &s;eparate funds for the intere&s;t of new loans, and having charged the intere&s;t of the unfunded debt again&s;t the &s;inking fund. The reproach is not without foundation; but as the in&s;tances are of no great importance, the con&s;equences of them have been maliciou&s;ly exaggerated. The arrears of the war amounted to a con&s;iderable &s;um. The la&s;t loan, in 1761, though not &s;ufficient to clear them off, met with &s;o much con|tradiction in the article of the cyder tax, and the oppo&s;ition was &s;o powerful, that the mini&s;try thought that, in time of peace, the &s;inking fund might gradually di&s;charge the unfunded debt, as it has done in effect from year to year. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been a thou&s;and times repeated, and many people believe, that England, &s;ince the peace, has con&s;tantly contracted new debts to pay the intere&s;t of the old ones. Nothing can be more fal&s;e. Government has almo&s;t every year negotiated a loan at three per cent. with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a lottery, in order to convert the navy bills (which made part of the unfunded debt) and other four per cent. annuities into three per cents. Exclu&s;ive of this conver&s;ion, government has every year redeemed and extingui&s;hed &s;ome portion of the above debt; &s;o that, from the conclu&s;ion of the peace of Fontainbleau to the year 1770 inclu&s;ive, about eleven millions of capital debt have been actually paid off, without reckoning reductions of intere&s;t. In the pre&s;ent year, 1770, government has paid off a million and a half at three and a half per cent, borrowed in 1756, and a hundred thou&s;and pounds of navy debt, not to reckon a quantity of the four per cents. reduced to three.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>An objection has al&s;o been rai&s;ed again&s;t making the &s;inking fund an&s;werable for the civil li&s;t, and for all deficiencies in the given produce of the other funds; but, according to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, I do not think the objection founded; e&s;pecially as, on the other hand, &s;ome beneficial articles have been incorpo|rated

<P>Yet the clamors of the oppo&s;ition appear to de&s;erve &s;ome attention. No po&s;&s;ible method &s;hould be neglected to make the &s;inking fund more effectual, and to give it con&s;i&s;tence. The means I have pointed out &s;eem to me not to be neglected. I in&s;i&s;t upon the nece&s;&s;ity of creating an auxiliary permanent fund of redemption, that may operate equally in peace and war.</P>
<P>A permanent fund of redemption, con&s;tantly improving by the intere&s;t of the debt it di&s;charges, a tax upon collateral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, a tax upon the transfer of funded property, <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">As the public debt is at pre&s;ent circum&s;tanced, the idea of a tax upon the transfer of &s;tock is wholly chimerical. To impo&s;e it by mere authority of the legi&s;lature would be a direct violation of the faith of parliament to the public creditor, and &s;erve as a precedent for other operations of the &s;ame nature. Yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the author's &s;cheme is ingenious, and by no means im|practicable in the ca&s;e of any future loan. People, who inve&s;t their money in the &s;tocks, &s;eldom think of &s;elling out in a &s;hort time. The difference between &s;elling ninety-nine in&s;tead of a hundred, at a di&s;tant period, would make very little difference in the pre&s;ent value of one hundred pounds &s;tock, on which the pur|cha&s;er receives the complete intere&s;t of a hundred pounds, as long as he continues to hold the &s;tock. The effect of &s;uch a condition, annexed to the transfer of &s;tock, would be &s;low and in&s;en&s;ible, with re&s;pect to the diminution of the capital debt; but, as the operation would be con&s;tant, the debt would be gradually lowering every day, and in time be di&s;charged. Small means con&s;tantly operating are congenial to our political con&s;titution. Violent or rapid mea&s;ures belong to arbitrary govern|ments, and in all governments are a &s;ign of di&s;tre&s;s. In the pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of our funds, the mini&s;ter has but very few expedients within his reach. If, by exerting all the means within his power, the price of the three per cents. could be rai&s;ed a little above par, mea&s;ures might then be fallen upon, to engage the proprietors to &s;ub&s;cribe in their &s;tock, &s;ubject to the condition of being transferred to every future purcha&s;er &s;ucce&s;&s;ively at one per cent. le&s;s than what it &s;tood at in the name of the la&s;t proprietor, and the intere&s;t to decrea&s;e in the &s;ame proportion, and the deduction upon both principal and intere&s;t to commence from the next en&s;uing day of paying the dividends. This would be a &s;troke of finance &s;uperior to any thing that has ever been attempted or thought of in this country. In&s;tead of tru&s;ting entirely to the zeal and oeconomy of future mini&s;ters, we &s;hould at once put the debt into a cour&s;e of di&s;charging it&s;elf, and annex a peri&s;hable quality to an evil, which, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;eems to be immortal.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE>

and periods fixed for lightening the burthen of taxes, are effectual methods to &s;upport public credit. The &s;y&s;tem I propo&s;ed in France was not pur&s;ued. The reduction of intere&s;t &s;hould have been made without a direct diminution of the capital, and apparently with the free con&s;ent of the proprietors. This, after the peace, was practicable, if a right plan had been pur&s;ued. When once the original contracts were violated, there was no remedy. Yet I confe&s;s the tax upon transfers, attempted in France, might have been of &s;ervice, if precautions had been taken not to check circulation. In their pre&s;ent form, they are too heavy, and produce le&s;s than a more moderate tax would do, becau&s;e the transfers are le&s;s frequent than they would be. No man regards one per cent. more or le&s;s; but five per cent is an object, and fetters all dealings in the &s;tocks. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot &s;uppre&s;s an idea that occurs to me, with re&s;pect to the tax upon the transfer of funded property. I know with how much repugnance it was received in France, and I fore&s;ee what would be the con&s;equence in England, if this &s;tring &s;hould ever be touched. Yet I intreat every judicious Engli&s;hman to lend a little of his attention to the following reflections. Suppo&s;e the financier, who fir&s;t introduced the &s;y&s;tem of loans upon annuities, had conceived the following &s;cheme; I a&s;k whether any per&s;on would have objected to it, and whether credit and circula|tion would not have been &s;upported with &s;till greater ea&s;e than they have been. Suppo&s;e government, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, had demanded only ninety-nine pounds from the &s;ub&s;criber, yet agreed to pay intere&s;t upon a hundred, on condition that, when he &s;old that &s;tock, he &s;hould only be allowed to transfer ninety-nine, and the purcha&s;er to receive intere&s;t upon ninety-nine, but &s;ubject to the &s;ame condition of transferring only ninety-eight, and &s;o on. Nobody would have regarded the paltry defalcation of one per cent. but con&s;idered it as e&s;&s;ential to the nature of the fund, and the be&s;t method of &s;ecuring the credit of it. An in&s;titution of this &s;ort would annex a redemption to the e&s;&s;ence of the fund, which, in the cour&s;e of frequent transfers, would in&s;en&s;ibly be reduced to nothing. The national debt could never have reached its pre&s;ent exce&s;&s;ive volume. Our anxiety for po&s;terity would be removed, and every auxiliary analagous mea&s;ure, directed to the &s;ame object, would be &s;o much the more ea&s;y and effectual. This, I apprehend, is a plain, palpable truth, within every man's comprehen&s;ion. But it will be &s;aid, What &s;ignifies regretting what is pa&s;t? Will it cure the pre&s;ent evil? I leave the an&s;wer to the reader. The importance and utility of the mea&s;ure are &s;ufficiently obvious. A time may come, when nece&s;&s;ity may oblige the nation to &s;acrifice a &s;mall part to the pre&s;ervation of the whole. Sooner or later it mu&s;t be done. The mode of doing it is the point to be con&s;idered. In the mean time it is certain that if, during ten years of peace, a light tax upon the &s;ale or transfer of all the real and funded property of the kingdom were employed in paying off the national debt, it might be reduced to a point, below which it could not be lowered without imprudence. Government would then be at its ea&s;e to &s;ecure peace abroad, dimini&s;h taxes in general, and take off tho&s;e which might be mo&s;t burthen&s;ome to the nation. If this method &s;hould ever be adopted, whether from nece&s;&s;ity or patrioti&s;m, I mu&s;t add this warning to it, that with re&s;pect to the &s;tocks, it is in my opinion e&s;&s;ential, that the one per cent. &s;hould never be received in money as a tax entitling the holder to transfer a hundred pounds of &s;tock. That money might be applied to other purpo&s;es, and the remedy would be empirical. At every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive transfer, the purcha&s;er mu&s;t receive a capital of one per cent. le&s;s than the la&s;t holder. This is more e&s;&s;ential than people may be aware of. If it were po&s;&s;ible for the nation to reli&s;h &s;uch a mea&s;ure, together with a tax upon collateral &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, and the conver&s;ion of a portion of the principal debt into life annuities, I would an&s;wer that, under a prudent admini&s;tration, peace might be firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and that, in le&s;s than ten years, things would be in a condition to admit of a &s;en&s;ible diminution of taxes.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>In the French edicts of the year 1763 it was in&s;inuated, that the plan of di&s;charging the debts of the &s;tate was &s;o &s;erious, that it was propo&s;ed to extend it to the life annuities and tontines. The intention was excellent, but it produced a contrary effect.

Be&s;ides, when this &s;tring is touched, the &s;tate gives up the only re&s;ource it has left in the mid&s;t of failing credit and di&s;tre&s;s. To redeem the life annuities is al&s;o contrary to the intere&s;t and intention of the proprietors, who purcha&s;ed them with the &s;acrifice of their capital. They &s;unk their money upon the&s;e annuities in the heat of the war, when they might have made double the intere&s;t of it that they could in time of peace, be&s;ides the great chance of the value of their &s;tock ri&s;ing at the end of the war; whereas they have no opportunity of making the &s;ame advantage, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be paid off.

This, like any other way of laying out one's money, is a que&s;tion of &s;peculation and convenience. As for unmarried per&s;ons, or libertines, it would be the &s;ame thing.

Diogenes, to prove the reality of motion again&s;t the &s;ophi&s;try of Zeno, got up and walked. We need only follow the hi&s;tory of facts, to refute by experience every thing that has been &s;aid concerning the national debt, &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent century.

<P>Of all the writers, who have been deceived with regard to the national debt, none &s;urpri&s;ed me more than the celebrated Mr. Hume. I had the honor of knowing him at Paris, and ob&s;erved with infinite plea&s;ure, that his di&s;po&s;ition was &s;uperior to his under&s;tanding. It is to truth that he is indebted for this elogium. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ential &s;ervices, which I have &s;ince received from him in London, entitle him to my warme&s;t gratitude.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> This great man, before the la&s;t peace, had written an E&s;&s;ay on Public Credit, which I had not &s;een when I drew up the fir&s;t part of my E&s;&s;ay on Circulation. It was mentioned to me afterwards, and I was concerned to find that my own Treati&s;e &s;eemed exactly a refutation of his. He read it &s;ome time after at Paris, together with the Letter in which I have endeavoured to prove that the jealou&s;y of commerce is ill under&s;tood, and that the true intere&s;ts of princes are not at variance; and he was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s his approbation of the two e&s;&s;ays in terms which I
<PB N="104" REF="124">
cannot venture to repeat. That &s;ublime genius had al&s;o touched the &s;ubject of the jealou&s;y of commerce. If he had unfolded the principles of his &s;y&s;tem more at large, I &s;hould have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed my letter. The hope that he will do it one day or other, and the approbation with which he honored that little treati&s;e, determined me to publi&s;h it. I flatter my&s;elf, that Mr. Hume will al&s;o correct &s;ome of his ideas on circulation and public credit. He may be right in a certain &s;en&s;e, when he foretells, that either the nation mu&s;t de&s;troy public credit, or public credit will de&s;troy the nation. It mu&s;t undoubtedly happen &s;o, if precautions were not taken. I believe I have made him ea&s;y upon that point; yet I cannot refrain from &s;ug|ge&s;ting to him, with all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due to his under&s;tanding, that he advances another propo&s;ition, the con&s;equences of which might be as dangerous, as the principles on which it re&s;ts appear to me to be que&s;tionable. Mr. Hume &s;ays, that, if a &s;punge were applied to the national debt, thou&s;ands would be &s;acrificed to the &s;afety of millions. Without enquiring whether honor is, in any ca&s;e, to be &s;acrificed to advantage, I affirm only, that the millions would for a long time feel the &s;acrifice of the thou|&s;ands. Mr. Hume did not con&s;ider, that if three millions &s;terling, paid in annuities within the kingdom, were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e three millions would &s;top a circulation that repre&s;ents perhaps thirty millions in expence; that every order of the &s;tate, even to the beggar, would feel the effects of it; and that the &s;ource of taxation would be dried up. Con&s;ider the example of the circulation of a &s;ingle crown piece, &s;tated in the Fir&s;t Part of this Work. If &s;uch an event &s;hould ever take place, people would kneel at the &s;ight of a guinea. We have &s;een an in&s;tance of this di&s;tre&s;s in France, where things were never carried to that extremity; yet the French funds never
<PB N="105" REF="125">
had an ea&s;y circulation. The con&s;titutions of the two kingdoms are very different. The re&s;ources of France are infinite; yet, upon the fall of Law's &s;y&s;tem, the de&s;olation was almo&s;t univer|&s;al, although the &s;punge was very far from extending to the whole national debt. In that ca&s;e commerce would be at a &s;tand; a public bankruptcy would draw along with it the bankruptcy of a great part of the merchants, who&s;e means and credit would be annihilated; indu&s;try, for a time, would cea&s;e to exi&s;t, or be compelled to quit the country; agriculture would feel the con|&s;equences. The fire would extend far and near, and the confu&s;ion become univer&s;al. The &s;tate, the government, would be without re&s;ources. So dangerous a convul&s;ion would bring us to that fatal period, at which the breath of an infant might overturn the &s;tate. We might then &s;ay, with Monte&s;quieu, that there would be nothing left of the picture of the &s;tate except the frame, liable to be broken by the lea&s;t external effort.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that, when Mr. Hume wrote the above e&s;&s;ay, he had not yet made an exact and commercial analy&s;is of circu|lation, of the nature of the funds, and of the effects of annuities. He had been &s;truck with &s;ome truths di&s;advantageous to paper and credit, and which had interrupted the &s;ight of others, calculated to correct the inconveniences attending it. Thus it often happens, that truth leads to error, and error to truth. To arrive at truth, we mu&s;t &s;eparate delu&s;ions, and &s;ift fal&s;ehood to the bottom. Mr. Hume ob&s;erved, that multiplying the repre&s;entative &s;igns lowered the value of &s;pecie. But he did not con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;uch &s;igns to repre&s;ent the multitude of things, which the abundance of gold and &s;ilver has in &s;ome mea&s;ure rendered nece&s;&s;ary. Let us new model our manners; let us go twenty centuries back; let us reduce human nature to its primitive condition; let us bani&s;h tho&s;e factitious
<PB N="106" REF="126">
wants which we have changed into nece&s;&s;ities; let us be philo|&s;ophers, and with Diogenes reject the earthen ve&s;&s;el, and drink out of the hollow of the hand; let us be poor and virtuous, and Mr. Hume's principles may then be applied. But &s;ince there is no likelihood of &s;uch an alteration &s;or &s;ome centuries, we may as well pur&s;ue our cour&s;e, and endeavour to correct abu&s;es. Let us imitate Solon, who gave the Athenians the be&s;t laws they were capable of receiving. We mu&s;t often live with our enemies, and compound with our infirmities. Imperfection is our inhe|ritance, and little inconveniences mu&s;t be preferred to great ones. Though we may be a&s;&s;ured that death will come, let us not kill our&s;elves for fear of dying. Every &s;tate, let its political con&s;titution be ever &s;o well devi&s;ed, carries within it&s;elf the principle of its di&s;&s;olution. <HI>If Rome and Sparta peri&s;hed, what &s;tate can hope to endure for ever?</HI> We mu&s;t not attempt to govern a corrupted people by the &s;ame laws which &s;uit a virtuous people. The expre&s;&s;ion is &s;evere; but the principle of that au&s;tere philo&s;opher may be applied to the que&s;tion before us. England, in all appearance, will &s;uffer the fate of other &s;tates that have gone before her. But let us not encroach upon providence. The period &s;eems yet at a great di&s;tance.</P>

<P>They, who have undertaken to apologi&s;e for luxury, have run into another extreme. Their view of that multiplied circu|lation, which encourages indu&s;try and commerce, has not been complete. They did not con&s;ider, that circulation is maintained by a daily expence, permanent, &s;olid, and con&s;tantly kept up;
<PB N="107" REF="127">
whereas exce&s;&s;ive luxury, by di&s;ordering the various &s;prings on which the fortunes of individuals are balanced, and exhau&s;ting their re&s;ources, is injurious to indu&s;try and circulation. The numerary wealth of a great number of individuals is annihilated by a forced luxury, and is not di&s;per&s;ed through the public, as hath been fal&s;ely imagined. This is the great point of the que&s;tion. I do not condemn that expence, or relative luxury, which is proportioned to the means and rank of the individual; but that which confounds all ranks, which renders &s;o many per&s;ons the victims of opinion ill under&s;tood, makes them glitter for a moment, then bani&s;hes them to ob&s;curity, from which they never emerge. This is the luxury which I affirm is de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive luxury in England has given birth to another vice, to which the enormous increa&s;e of the debt may truly be a&s;cribed. The character of the nation is to carry every thing to exce&s;s; virtue, vice, every quality is pu&s;hed to an extreme. The Engli&s;h have no oeconomy in their expences in time of war. They do that with more, which might be done with le&s;s. No man, I pre&s;ume, will venture to deny, that they might have done as much with one third le&s;s expence. The immen&s;e and rapid fortunes, made by their contractors in Germany, exceed all that we have heard of by the financiers in France. Plunder, wa&s;te, and rapine, as we are told, were carried to the highe&s;t pitch; and how could it be otherwi&s;e, when the annual expence amounted to near three times as much as in the war of 1744? The annual loans were then from three millions to three and a half; in the la&s;t years of the late war they were carried to twelve. The efforts, I confe&s;s, were more vigorous, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es more brilliant; but by no means in that proportion.

<HEAD>PART III. <HI>Of Finances, Taxes, and Agriculture, con&s;idered principally with re&s;pect to France. Refutation of the Principle, which reduces every thing to the Territorial Produce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MONSIEUR de Mirabeau, in his Theory of Taxation, affirms, that it would be the philo&s;opher's &s;tone to the &s;tate, to make the machine of finance move in regular tracks, not only without exaction, without rigor, or expence, but from a &s;pirit of emulation. He thinks he has di&s;covered the &s;ecret, but I fear he is deceived. His heart has mi&s;led his under&s;tanding. The works of this virtuous citizen, this amiable philo&s;opher, are replete with genius, &s;ublime ideas, and views equally new and profound. True patrioti&s;m, humanity, and the friend of mankind, appear in every part of them. Yet, in his Theory of Taxation, I think he has deluded him&s;elf with an impracticable &s;y&s;tem. He fir&s;t of all thought he &s;aw devouring mon&s;ters, and ruin near and inevitable, where at the wor&s;t there were only inconveniences, and grievous abu&s;es. The principles he &s;ets out with are &s;ometimes true. In the application to practice, and deduction of con&s;equences, I think he lo&s;es his way. Other principles, which he lays down as axioms, are contradicted by experience. Nobody will di&s;pute with him, for in&s;tance, that agriculture is the organical action of a &s;tate, who&s;e riches belong to the &s;oil; or that re&s;traints upon agriculture debilitate the
<PB N="110" REF="130">
powers of the &s;tate, and retard that action which gives life to its pro&s;perity. It will be admitted that the collection of taxes in France is too complicated, too expen&s;ive and &s;evere, and by that means too heavy, and in &s;ome articles oppre&s;&s;ive. It &s;hould certainly be reduced to greater &s;implicity in the mode; it &s;hould be alleviated, and &s;oftened in degree; and abu&s;es &s;hould be corrected. But to repre&s;ent France as on the brink of ruin, or to conceive that the taxes, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, far exceed the &s;phere of the contributive faculty, is an exaggeration, which experience does, and will long, contradict.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the Theory of Taxation amounts to this. Fir&s;t, that a &s;tate like France, who&s;e riches belong to the &s;oil, has no real revenue but its territorial produce. Secondly, that taxes &s;hould be laid at the &s;ource of production. Thirdly, that there &s;hould be an entire exemption in favor of labor and indu&s;try; that all the pre&s;ent taxes and duties &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and the very name of finance and farm be pro&s;cribed. Fourthly, that a general capitation tax &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, which, by &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the expence of collection, may produce more, and co&s;t le&s;s. This expence, according to him, ab&s;orbs a third of the taxes, and is the cau&s;e of general de&s;truction. Fifthly, that this office &s;hould be intru&s;ted to the municipal magi&s;trates. Sixthly, the author affirms, that the real revenue of France does not at pre&s;ent amount to any thing near the taxes that are levied, and that loans are ruinous.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of the author of the <HI>Bilan</HI> with re&s;pect to England. I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf to one general argument on the &s;ubject, and examine in a &s;ummary way &s;ome of Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's detached maxims, in order to confirm the principles I have already laid
<PB N="111" REF="131">
down, and throw a new light upon the preceding parts of this work.</P>
<P>The Theory of Taxation dwells much upon the high price of articles of con&s;umption. We have already ob&s;erved, that the quantity of the metals has lowered the value of money in its quality of &s;ign. A man now, with a much greater numerary wealth, is not richer in proportion than he was a century ago. But it is in vain to &s;ay that the mark of &s;ilver is nominally worth double what it was in the time of Harry IV. and that Lewis XV. with a greater numerary, is not &s;o rich as his pre|dece&s;&s;ors. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>Increa&s;ing the numerary wealth, and rai&s;ing the nominal value of the coin, are two different things, which in this place the author &s;eems to confound. The fir&s;t is done by increa&s;ing either the quantity of &s;pecie without altering the &s;tandard, or by multiplying the &s;igns that repre&s;ent it, and which, as long as credit is &s;upported, an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of &s;pecie. The &s;econd, in an arbitrary government, may be done ad infinitum; that is, you may coin an ounce of &s;ilver into ten pieces, or twenty, in&s;tead of five, and call each piece a &s;hilling; but neither the king nor nation will be one penny the richer by it. Suppo&s;e, for example, the whole &s;pecie of the kingdom con&s;i&s;ted of a million of guineas. If the notes of a bank, or company, or government &s;ecurities, can be circulated at par to the amount of another million, the numerary wealth of the nation is actually doubled. But if, in&s;tead of this operation, it &s;hould be thought advi&s;e|able to recoin the million of guineas into two million of pieces, and &s;till to call each piece a guinea, the effect would not be the &s;ame. The numerary wealth of the nation would not be doubled, but remain exactly as it was. In &s;pite of the nominal value, the new money would in effect be reduced to its intrin&s;ic value, that is, the new guinea would not purcha&s;e more than half the old one. I &s;peak of a &s;tate that has intercour&s;e with other nations. An in&s;ulated &s;tate, that had no foreign connections what&s;oever, might agree upon arbitrary &s;igns of wealth among them&s;elves, without any regard to intrin&s;ic value. On the above principles, admitting the nominal revenue of Lewis XV. to double that of Harry IV. it does not nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the real wealth of the former &s;hould &s;urpa&s;s that of the latter.</P>
<P>By the following calculation it appears, that the revenue of the pre&s;ent king falls far &s;hort of that of his immediate predece&s;&s;or, as it &s;tood in the year 1683; from which period the royal revenues, though improved by new taxes, and nominally increa&s;ing, have con&s;tantly declined in real value.</P>
<P>In 1683, Lewis the XIVth's fixed revenue amounted to 116, 873, 476 livres.</P>
<P>In 1754, Lewis the XVth's fixed revenue amounted to 200,000,000 ditto.</P>
<P>But if a computation be made of the intrin&s;ic value of the livre at tho&s;e different periods, it will appear that Lewis XIV. had a much greater revenue than his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, without reckoning the increa&s;e in the price of things. In 1683, twenty-eight livres were equal to the mark of &s;ilver. In 1754, the mark of &s;ilver was worth 49 livres, 16 &s;ols. Now

every thing is not doubled. The &s;oldier's pay &s;tands as it did in the time of Harry IV. and bread, as well as many other important articles, are nearly at the &s;ame rate they were then. Be&s;ides, as Voltaire ob&s;erved, it co&s;ts no more at pre&s;ent to be well and agreeably lodged, than it did under Harry IV. A hou&s;e may be adorned with beautiful gla&s;&s;es of modern manu|facture,

Our fine &s;howy &s;ilks are not &s;o dear, yet much better than tho&s;e which we u&s;ed to purcha&s;e of foreigners. Be&s;ides this, it cannot be denied, that the number of people, rich and at their ea&s;e, is much greater than in the time of Harry IV. nor that the income of many per&s;ons is doubled and trebled, which cannot fail of increa|&s;ing the revenue of the prince in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that if the fir&s;t wants, being the mo&s;t urgent, are &s;upplied out of the fir&s;t half of a man's income, the power of contribution ari&s;ing from the other half may not only be double, but quadruple what it would be if he had only half his income. Let me explain my&s;elf by an example. A man, who&s;e annual income is fifty thou&s;and crowns, is twice as rich, in point of numerary, as one who has only twenty-five thou&s;and with the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hment; but his power of faculty and contribution is in a much higher proportion, as well with re&s;pect to articles of fancy, as to works of charity, and expences of ornament and vanity; whereas he who has only twenty-five thou&s;and crowns, finds his revenue ab&s;orbed in the
<PB N="114" REF="134">
fir&s;t wants annexed to his &s;tation, &s;uppo&s;ing him to figure in the world, and to maintain a certain rank or e&s;tabli&s;hment. He has but little left to gratify his fancy. If, therefore, Lewis XV. be not quite twice as rich, nor twice as powerful, as Harry IV. yet, &s;ince the numerary of his revenue is doubled, and &s;ince he has a greater number of wealthy &s;ubjects, he mu&s;t at all events be con&s;iderably &s;uperior both in wealth and power. As for tho&s;e fi&s;cal abu&s;es, imputed to the pre&s;ent age, they have prevailed at all times, and, with a weak admini&s;tration, enervated, in &s;ome degree, the contributive faculty of the &s;ubject. It is a fever incident to great &s;tates. The &s;eeds of &s;uch di&s;orders are as inevi|table as tho&s;e which undermine the human con&s;titution. Yet the remedy &s;hould be &s;ought, and where &s;pecifics cannot be found, palliatives may be applied. But I affirm boldly, on a train of rea&s;oning confirmed by experience, that the project, which has &s;o long &s;educed the world, of reducing all taxes to a &s;ingle one, by way of capitation, and of aboli&s;hing all other taxes what&s;oever with the expences of collection, is a chimera in &s;uch countries as France, England, and Holland. The attempt was made in Holland in the year 1749, and the fallacy was &s;oon perceived. It was found to be utterly impo&s;&s;ible to levy tho&s;e &s;ums upon the public, which the &s;tate had occa&s;ion for, by any other means but duties upon articles of con&s;umption, where the tax is confounded with the price. This method is the lea&s;t felt, and the only one fea&s;ible. The inconveniences re&s;ulting from it, how great &s;oever they may appear, are far from being &s;o dangerous as they are repre&s;ented. I have &s;hown the truth of this po&s;ition in the Fir&s;t Part of this E&s;&s;ay, and in the &s;equel &s;hall offer fre&s;h proofs in &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>Holland it&s;elf con&s;titutes a demon&s;tration, that Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's principles are not well founded. If taxes were not to
<PB N="115" REF="135">
be collected, but immediately at the &s;ource of the &s;ubject's revenue, as Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau &s;uppo&s;es, and if nothing were to be exacted but a portion of the territorial produce, Hol|land long ago mu&s;t have cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. Her alimentary productions are but few; &s;he has &s;carce any arable land, vine|yards, or woods. On this &s;ide all her re&s;ources con&s;i&s;t in a few meadows; yet the republic pays troops, maintains a marine, and has often figured on a level with the fir&s;t powers of Europe. Taxes of every kind are heavier than in France or England; yet the &s;tate is not ruined by them, but &s;ub&s;i&s;ts with opulence. If the jealou&s;y of her commerce had not excited &s;uch a number of competitors, the &s;tate would &s;carce have felt the effect of the exorbitant taxes levied upon the &s;ubject. Bread, an object of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, pays a duty that nearly doubles the price. Every article of con&s;umption pays more than in France. Capital &s;tock of all kinds, &s;uch as hou&s;es, actions, contracts, lands, are &s;till more loaded. Yet Holland flouri&s;hes, and the machine of finance pre&s;erves its cour&s;e. It is the magic of credit and circu|lation that produces the&s;e &s;alutary effects. This credit and circulation are not therefore &s;o mi&s;chievous in practice as Mon|&s;ieur de Mirabeau &s;u&s;pects. We mu&s;t yield to the evidence of a con&s;tant, uniform, deci&s;ive experience. The opulence of the rich man, through the medium of circulation, &s;upplies the poor man and the beggar wherewithal to pay a tax to the &s;tate, in the con&s;umption of the edibles on which he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. The beggar obtains the mere phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;aries of life more ea&s;ily at Paris, London, or Am&s;terdam, than at Montauban, York, or Overy&s;&s;el. Circulation and credit are two &s;prings, the play of which is not thoroughly under&s;tood. All the gold and &s;ilver of Europe and America, that is wa&s;ted in Indo&s;tan, does not enrich the inhabitants of that country. The Indians are poor; their
<PB N="116" REF="136">
princes ama&s;s trea&s;ures and &s;top circulation, which has no credit to &s;upport it. Taxes upon con&s;umption not only make the beggar, but even animals, beneficial to the revenue, and con&s;e|quently to the &s;tate. They, who have been &s;educe by the idea of a &s;ingle tax, and of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the various ramifications of taxation, do not know that, in the riche&s;t and mo&s;t opulent &s;tates, the number of per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s a real fortune (I mean, of tho&s;e who would be &s;ubject to a capitation, and who, in Holland, are called the Capitali&s;ts) is very &s;mall in compari&s;on with the other inhabitants; whereas the number of tho&s;e who, without any real fortune, live at their ea&s;e, and at a higher expence than common hou&s;ekeepers, is very con&s;iderable. It is their indu&s;try, employments, and various talents, that con&s;titute their re&s;ources. They are not rich, yet they live as expen&s;ively as if they were &s;o. They cannot po&s;&s;ibly be taxed in that high proportion, which would be nece&s;&s;ary to form an equivalent for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all other taxes. It has been found impo&s;&s;ible. I &s;peak from fact. This point has been thoroughly examined by the able&s;t financiers in Holland. When the tax is charged upon edibles, the circulating money returns in part into the public trea&s;ury, from which it i&s;&s;ued. It multiplies as it runs, and cir|culating &s;ucce&s;&s;ively through twenty different hands, enables each of them to continue the expence of the preceding year, and always with the &s;ame &s;pecie. A great man, who &s;pends a hundred thou&s;and florins a year, at once returns twenty thou&s;and to the public trea&s;ury on the head of his fir&s;t expence; but this is nothing compared to the reverberation of expences, which the inferior ranks, and the&s;e again &s;ubdivided into &s;till lower orders of men, are, by his magnificence, enabled to engage in; &s;o that, at the end of the year, it is po&s;&s;ible that the whole hundred thou&s;and florins may have pa&s;&s;ed with benefit
<PB N="117" REF="137">
through the public trea&s;ury, and i&s;&s;ued out again to &s;upply the various channels of circulation. In &s;pite of all that has been &s;aid to the contrary, the annuitants contribute greatly to maintain this happy circulation. Taxes are, in reality, no more than a momentary rever&s;ion of certain portions of property, which individuals &s;uffer to pa&s;s annually through the trea&s;ury, for their own pre&s;ervation, and which return wholly, or in part, into the hand that pays them. There is a perpetual circle of retribution from the &s;overeign to the &s;ubect, and from the &s;ubject to the &s;overeign. All the declamations, that contradict this definition, prove too much, and lead to the ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>We are for ever told, that France and England are undone, though experience &s;hows us that the two kingdoms are &s;till in a flouri&s;hing condition. There are enormous abu&s;es, I confe&s;s; yet even the&s;e abu&s;es prove the vigor of the con&s;titution. The &s;ub&s;tance &s;aves the form. They will never be corrected by the means of an univer&s;al tax, much le&s;s by a land tax to be paid in kind; another chimera in our European con&s;titutions. Such modes of taxation might an&s;wer in a &s;acerdotal government. Among a people collected into a &s;mall territory, a tithe in kind of the productions of the earth, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;mall capi|tation, might be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all purpo&s;es. But &s;ince the powers of Europe have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to their tran|quillity at home, and &s;ecurity abroad, to maintain armies and fleets in time of peace, &s;uch a plan would be ineffectual. Be&s;ides, there is no &s;tate now in Europe, except Poland, that con&s;i&s;ts merely of farmers. Commerce, the fi&s;heries, luxury, paper &s;ecurity, the public funds, various manufactures mul|tiplied in every branch, factitious riches, now con&s;titute the ma&s;s of property. In the general &s;y&s;tem, the &s;ecret of admini&s;tration con&s;i&s;ts in combining the&s;e different objects, without &s;uffering
<PB N="118" REF="138">
them to interfere with each other. To pro&s;cribe, to aboli&s;h, or decry them, would be overturning the edifice. But, as the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf is, in &s;ome degree, a new &s;cience, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was only towards the end of the la&s;t century that loans began to be reduced to &s;y&s;tem.<HI>&mdash;Author.</HI></NOTE> we have yet got no farther than the elements of it, and are &s;till groping our way. From hence have ari&s;en the mi&s;takes of &s;o many ingenious people, who have di&s;cour&s;ed upon the public funds, credit, and circulation, applying ob&s;olete principles to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of taxation, finance, population, and agriculture. Some great genius will, one day or other, di&s;cover the true proportion of the new &s;y&s;tem of policy, by analy&s;ing the &s;prings that give it motion, and explaining the internal play of the wheels. In the mean time it will happen, as Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau ob&s;erves, that, while we endeavour to accelerate the motion of the wheel, the impre&s;&s;ion will be too heavy upon &s;ome parts, and di&s;compo&s;e the re&s;t, by which the progre&s;s of the machine will &s;ometimes be &s;topped. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, the mo&s;t important object of all political &s;cience is the mode of collecting the revenue; for on this point, undoubtedly, the whole effect of it depends, as well as the harmony of the &s;tate. The que&s;tion is to find out rules clear, exact, and certain; <HI>hoc opus, hic labor e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>There is one great inconvenience, attending an univer&s;al tax by capitation, which, if in it&s;elf it were a practicable mea&s;ure, would &s;till make it a dangerous one. Such a tax would take too great a quantity of money out of circulation at once, and make &s;pecie extremely &s;carce at every period of collection; which can never happen, as long as it pa&s;&s;es through the multiplied channels of con&s;umption. The intervals between receipt and di&s;tribution are kept in equilibrium; and this is &s;o true, that
<PB N="119" REF="139">
in Holland, where the plenty of money has made it a kind of merchandi&s;e, &s;pecie became extremely &s;carce, from an accident of the above nature, in the year 1747. To an&s;wer the demands of the war, a method had been thought of to rai&s;e a large &s;um of money, without borrowing. All the &s;ubjects of the republic were induced to contribute, <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot"><P>This operation required an explanation, with which the author has favored me. The fiftieth penny was to be paid at four periods. The trea&s;ury, or rather the &s;tate, was pre&s;&s;ed for money. It was apprehended, that private per|&s;ons would keep their money locked up, in order to have it ready to make good their re&s;pective payments, which would have checked circulation. To prevent this inconvenience, and at the &s;ame time to obtain an immediate &s;upply of money, they i&s;&s;ued receipts bearing intere&s;t, upon which private per&s;ons advanced money. The&s;e receipts were afterwards paid in at the trea&s;ury, on account of the tax, as the re&s;pective periods came round. By the&s;e means the &s;tate obtained an imme|diate &s;upply, circulation was promoted, the payment of the tax was facilitated, and the repre&s;entative &s;igns of the current &s;pecie were augmented for a time.</P>
<P>The produce of the above tax did not an&s;wer the expectations of government. Few people gave in an exact &s;tate of their property; &s;o that, in&s;tead of two per+cent. &s;carce one half per cent. was actually paid, and government was obliged to have recour&s;e to a lottery and other expedients.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE> by way of free gift, the fiftieth penny of their whole property at four periods. The amount mu&s;t of cour&s;e be con&s;iderable. To prevent the inconvenience above mentioned, the trea&s;ury were obliged to make out receipts, which they di&s;tributed among a number of private per&s;ons for the re&s;pective periods of paying in the fiftieth penny, in order to prevent that &s;tagnation, or &s;top of circulation, which mu&s;t have happened, if &s;o large a &s;um had been depo&s;ited in the trea&s;ury at one payment. This paper facilitated circulation, and brought forth &s;pecie, which would not have appeared without it.</P>
<P>To ama&s;s at once, for any given time, let it be ever &s;o &s;hort, a great quantity of money in the public trea&s;ury, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily choak circulation, and produce the heavie&s;t inconveniences.
<PB N="120" REF="140">
This can never happen in the mode of laying the tax upon con|&s;umption, where the collection is in&s;en&s;ible, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and gradual, and thereby gives time for the money to i&s;&s;ue out of the public trea&s;ury, and circulate again through the public. A hundred ob&s;ervations, confirmed by experience, prove the truth of what I advance.</P>
<P>Nothing is more changeable than the fortune of individuals. Some are enriched while others are impoveri&s;hed. A capitation, or univer&s;al tax, mu&s;t be rectified every year; and in the fir&s;t in&s;tance it mu&s;t be a heavy tax that is an equivalent for all the re&s;t. The machine would be for ever out of order. What an embar|ra&s;&s;ment! The impo&s;&s;ibility of the project &s;trikes in every view. A capitation can never be any thing but a &s;upplemental mea&s;ure; it never can produce a tenth part of the tax upon con&s;umption. The utmo&s;t u&s;e that could be made of it would be to redeem the taxes which interrupt and retard the labor of the plough. In this &s;ingle view it might perhaps be practicable and beneficial. As for the re&s;t, experience mu&s;t be our guide. It is certain, that formerly the farmers general in France ama&s;&s;ed fortunes with an indecent rapidity; but this abu&s;e is now greatly dimi|ni&s;hed. We no longer &s;ee that opulent quarantine, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">The farmers general are forty in number, with a &s;tanding army under them of clerks, taxgatherers, exci&s;emen, &amp;c.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> nor tho&s;e armies of one part of the nation employed to ruin the other. Among the number of financiers, there are true patriots, men of &s;en&s;e, and virtuous citizens. Their occupation is odious, but it appears to be nece&s;&s;ary. Their &s;ubalterns &s;ometimes commit acts of atrocious violence. But abu&s;es of this kind exi&s;t in armies commanded by the be&s;t generals. Many of the&s;e financiers and their adherents, when they do not ruin them&s;elves by an ex|ce&s;&s;ive, in&s;ulting luxury, are, without doubt, highly &s;erviceable
<PB N="121" REF="141">
to the &s;tate. They are enabled to a&s;&s;i&s;t circulation and credit, and in &s;pite of all that can be &s;aid by people who do not under|&s;tand the principles of finance, it is the combination of tho&s;e two agents that &s;upports the machine. In Holland, the farms &s;ub&s;i&s;t, although the farmers are aboli&s;hed. Collectors have been &s;ub&s;tituted in their room. The change of name was intended to &s;atisfy the people, who never can be &s;atisfied. The wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m of the &s;tadtholder, &s;upported by the zeal of the magi&s;trates, have improved the finances, and corrected in part the abu&s;es they were &s;ubject to, yet without aboli&s;hing the farms. The &s;ame thing ought to have been done in France, where the abu&s;es are more con&s;iderable, and perhaps more difficult to correct, from the complication of laws and privileges in every province, and their di&s;tance from the centre of admini&s;tration. I have endeavoured to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of the management of the farms in France. It appears to me that misfortunes are often imputed to the farmers general, which it is not in their power to remedy, and which are always exaggerated. Yet, for the welfare of the kingdom, it were to be wi&s;hed, that proper mea&s;ures might be taken to remedy the&s;e inconveniences, which are not the le&s;s dreadful becau&s;e they appear unavoidable. Heavy taxes are collected in England upon a more &s;imple and le&s;s expen&s;ive plan. Their method perhaps may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the con&s;titution and local circum&s;tances of the country. Whether or no it be practicable in France, or whether it be po&s;&s;ible to in&s;titute that regi&s;ter which all the world talks of, and nobody under&s;tands, is a que&s;tion yet undetermined.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau affirms, that the magi&s;trates and municipal officers are the natural collectors of the tribute, which the &s;ubjects, in their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions, owe to their &s;overeign. The idea is &s;educing, and perhaps the mea&s;ure may
<PB N="122" REF="142">
be right. Yet I do not know whether it would not meet with in&s;urmountable difficulties in practice, and whether, after a certain interval, the &s;ame things would not be &s;aid of them, that are &s;aid of the per&s;ons now employed in the collection of the revenue. It is not generally admitted that the provinces of France, which remain <HI>en pays d'Etat,</HI> have any advantage over the re&s;t. I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the fact to pro|nounce upon that mode of collection. The mini&s;ter un|doubtedly perceives the effect of it, and probably knows what to tru&s;t to. He will adopt it, if it be &s;uch as it is repre&s;ented. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;teps and hierarchical juri&s;dictions, which Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau would fain pro&s;cribe, &s;eem in &s;ome degree indi&s;pen&s;able in every mode of collection. The increa&s;e of expence, ari&s;ing from them, will be a &s;tumbling-block in every &s;y&s;tem. As for the re&s;t, I confe&s;s, that in the Theory of Taxation there are &s;ome &s;ublime ideas, which I admire and re&s;pect. All that the author &s;ays upon the &s;ubject of &s;alt and tobacco &s;eems to de&s;erve the attention of the French mini&s;try. It has often been ob&s;erved, before Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, that the produce of duties is in proportion to their lightne&s;s. A moderate duty &s;hould naturally put a &s;top to contraband, and &s;ave the wa&s;teful expences of management. The over burthen of the&s;e expences falls upon the &s;ale of the commodity, and le&s;&s;ens the con&s;umption. The&s;e truths appear inconte&s;table; yet in Holland we have often &s;een, that the diminution of duties at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e has not taken effect, nor prevented contraband. European nations, though Chri&s;tians, do not always follow the go&s;pel; they do not always give unto Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's. Every tax, every duty, every cu&s;tom, is paid with reluctance. We &s;hould endeavour to prevent this abu&s;e; for the principles above mentioned appear to me e&s;&s;ential. The &s;ame
<PB N="123" REF="143">
thing cannot, in my opinion, be &s;aid of his other principles. Such is the nece&s;&s;ity, he &s;uppo&s;es, of con&s;tituting a public trea&s;ure. I &s;hall hereafter prove it to be a hurtful, dan|gerous, and u&s;ele&s;s mea&s;ure. I have the &s;ame notion of his project of aboli&s;hing every impo&s;ition upon barren property, on &s;tocks, hou&s;es, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, employments, deeds, and luxury. It is a patriotic enthu&s;ia&s;m, founded upon metaphy&s;ical ideas, which never can be applied to the actual con&s;titution of things. His declamation again&s;t the public funds, credit, and circulation, is of the &s;ame nature, and has been already refuted. Another ob&s;ervation occurs to me. The &s;overeigns of Spain and Portugal, with all their trea&s;ures of Peru, Mexico, and the Brazils, never conceived the idea of creating the&s;e public funds, to which the value of &s;pecie might be com|municated, which might collect and give fixation to money, while it circulated el&s;ewhere, and call it in again, in ca&s;e of need, by the magic of circulation, and the credit imparted to tho&s;e funds. Who knows whether this may not be preci&s;ely the rea&s;on why tho&s;e kingdoms have not been enriched by their mines? There was no prop to &s;upport the building, while they were working upon the repairs. Spain and Portugal, depopulated by moral cau&s;es, might, I believe, in &s;ome degree, have recovered their population and agriculture, if the numerary riches of conven|tion had reali&s;ed the momentary pa&s;&s;age of the gold and &s;ilver of their mines. Factitious property would have produced indu&s;try, and &s;upplied a fund for improving the &s;oil, with all tho&s;e natural productions, which, in &s;o fortunate a climate, are ripened by the &s;un. Commerce, opulence, and circulation, might perhaps have invited a number of new inhabitants of the religion of the country, &s;ince the want of a toleration does not admit others to &s;ettle there. Even this odious difficulty might have been &s;ur|mounted
<PB N="124" REF="144">
by intere&s;t; whereas, at pre&s;ent, the inhabitants, notwith&s;tanding they pay fewer taxes, are poorer than tho&s;e of France or England. I do not &s;tate this conjecture as the only cau&s;e of the di&s;proportion between the actual condition of Spain and Portugal, and the &s;ources of metallic wealth, which both of them po&s;&s;e&s;s. I mean only to mark the advantage produced by circulation in countries where the metals are not &s;o plentiful. The mi&s;erable &s;tate of the Spaniards in Peru and Mexico is a &s;till &s;tronger proof that gold and &s;ilver are nothing of them&s;elves, but &s;o far as they readily pa&s;s in exchange for articles of nece&s;&s;ity and convenience. Mon&s;ieur de la Condamine a&s;&s;ures us, that the people, who &s;howed him the mines of Peru, were wretches without &s;hoes to their feet.</P>
<P>Spain and Portugal are not in that condition. If, added to the fertility of the &s;oil, and happine&s;s of the climate, the two kingdoms were as well peopled as they ought to be, the pro|ductions of nature and indu&s;try, independent of their mines, would make them the mo&s;t plentiful countries in the world. The exchange of their commodities might even create a com|mercial balance in their favor beyond the produce of their mines. But as this neither is, nor for a long time can be, the ca&s;e, we mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent con&s;ider the metals as a merchandi&s;e of their own growth, and the extraction thereof, to a certain degree, as nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful. I am even inclined to think, that if all the advantages of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, exi&s;ted with activity in Spain and Portugal; and if at the &s;ame time they were to continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gold and &s;ilver of Peru, Mexico, and the Brazils; the metals then, by rea&s;on of their abundance, might almo&s;t always perform their office in per&s;on, without factitious &s;igns, or the circulation of paper credit. I am neverthele&s;s per&s;uaded, that &s;uch a repletion of
<PB N="125" REF="145">
&s;pecie would produce inconveniences eventually fatal to the manners, and even to the commerce and pro&s;perity of the two nations, and that providence has not unde&s;ignedly given them the cu&s;tody, or rather the di&s;tribution, of the trea&s;ures of America.</P>
<P>If Portugal had pre&s;erved the Moluccas and Ceylon, which it was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of before the mines of Brazil were di&s;covered, the harmony of the commerce of Europe mu&s;t have been de&s;troyed. But if Holland had kept the Brazils, that harmony would &s;till have been maintained. Holland, as we have fre|quently ob&s;erved, has nothing to give in exchange. Indu&s;try, commerce, and &s;pice trade, con&s;titute all her opulence, and are &s;upported by tho&s;e factitious funds, to which credit gives circu|lation, and which enlarge the contributive faculty of the people to pay the taxes impo&s;ed upon them. Taxes follow opulence and ea&s;e. Competition in the market, and a greater con&s;ump|tion, of cour&s;e rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ions. Yet taxes are not to be multiplied without urgent nece&s;&s;ity, and every prudent mea&s;ure of police &s;hould be employed to prevent the exorbitant price of provi&s;ions. But, to return to my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Many attempts have been made to calculate the proportion that ought to be pre&s;erved between &s;pecie and paper. It has been a long time fixed at the rate of three to one; that is, that there may &s;afely be three times as much paper in circulation as money. Yet experience has evidently &s;hown, that the quantity of paper may be con&s;iderably enlarged, and yet &s;upport it&s;elf without difficulty. To call this a di&s;proportion is creating mon&s;ters on purpo&s;e to fight with them. It is contradicting experience, e&s;pecially as the &s;ame pretended di&s;proportion will be found to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between money and riches of every &s;ort, &s;uch as land, hou&s;es, &s;hips, jewels, &amp;c. Yet we are not to con|found bank notes, or bills of credit repre&s;enting money, with
<PB N="126" REF="146">
that paper which con&s;titutes the public &s;unds, and bears intere&s;t; although, in &s;ome re&s;pects, there is a great analogy between them. A much greater quantity of &s;tock may be created than of bank notes. The public funds do not exactly repre&s;ent &s;pecie, though the creation of them augments the numerary wealth. They form a &s;olid property, as much as land or hou&s;es, and yield a revenue without repairs or cultivation. The greate&s;t advantage attending them is, that they make money, and that which repre&s;ents it, circulate with more rapidity. Taken by parts, they may, in a certain &s;en&s;e, be con&s;idered as &s;o much ready money, the office of which they frequently perform. A hundred thou&s;and pounds in annuities may be converted into &s;pecie in 'Change Alley within four and twenty hours, with &s;carce any alteration in the price, and millions may be &s;old for time. The&s;e are facts not to be di&s;puted. Of all kinds of pro|perty, this is the only one that partakes, as it were, of the quality of money, at the &s;ame time that, by the e&s;&s;ence of its nature, it is a &s;olid property. The ob&s;ervation is important, and I believe has not been made before. I &s;hall add but one reflection more; that gold and &s;ilver coin has an arbitrary value of convention, and that there is no phy&s;ical rea&s;on why it &s;hould repre&s;ent all commodities, as well as the articles of fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, in preference to paper, by which it&s;elf is repre&s;ented. The Indians make the &s;ame u&s;e of &s;hells; and all the plau&s;ible objec|tions to the creation of artificial &s;igns in paper may be applied equally to the metals, which we can neither eat nor drink. But as in the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem a barter of commodities is impracticable, &s;ome general medium of exchange is wanted to be the mea&s;ure of every thing; and this quality no more belongs to metal than it does to &s;tocks and paper, when the circulation of them is
<PB N="127" REF="147">
&s;upported by credit and good faith, and by the intere&s;t they produce.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's principles are much the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the author of the <HI>Bilan,</HI> to reduce every thing to the territorial produce. Yet I think the fallacy of them appears even from his own &s;tatements of the territorial revenue of France compared with experience. His &s;y&s;tem is open to objections, becau&s;e it is contradicted by facts. How would it have been po&s;&s;ible for France to have exceeded her &s;trength in the article of taxation during &s;o long a period, without having been expo&s;ed to &s;ome more fatal, and as it were more palpable, political con|vul&s;ions? I &s;hall hereafter make it appear, that the di&s;orders in France have not &s;o much proceeded from taxes, as from the long wars, and the want of credit in borrowing money. I have already proved, that credit and circulation are the only means to correct and &s;often the &s;everity of taxes, and &s;hall &s;upport my opinion by farther evidence. Ob&s;ervation, enquiries, and cal|culations of the territorial revenue, may be of &s;ervice, if they are properly applied without exaggeration, and if they do not lead to con&s;equences incon&s;i&s;tent with known facts, or to mea|&s;ures either impo&s;&s;ible in practice, or who&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed effect is not ju&s;tified by experience. Yet, as it is po&s;&s;ible that, without Galileo and Kepler, Newton might never have analy&s;ed the rays of light, or thoroughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the principles of gravitation, it is to be hoped, that the works of &s;peculative politicians will in like manner a&s;&s;i&s;t others in explaining the true principles, on which the &s;inances &s;hould be admini&s;tered for the welfare and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>We are children &s;till. Our children perhaps may be men. I cannot comprehend how Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau can lay the whole burthen of taxation upon the territorial produce, after
<PB N="128" REF="148">
having &s;o clearly demon&s;trated, that the vexations heaped upon the hu&s;bandman de&s;troy tho&s;e riches which, without &s;uch vexations, would be annually renewed; that large tracts of land lie fallow and de&s;erted; that decay of population of cour&s;e dimini&s;hes con&s;umption, which he ought to con&s;ider as the &s;ource of the &s;overeign's revenue; that &s;poliation withers up the &s;oil; that the arbitrary land tax, repairs of the roads, and other vexations, ought to be aboli&s;hed. Yet he &s;ub&s;titutes the &s;ame burthen under another denomination, and gives no relief to that part of the nation. He &s;eems to me to contradict him|&s;elf, when he propo&s;es to lay the whole tax at the &s;ource of production; yet this is his favorite principle. Perhaps it may be my own fault; but I confe&s;s my ignorance; I do not under&s;tand his &s;y&s;tem; it appears to me to involve a contradiction. He advances another principle, which, in the ab&s;tract, &s;eems nearer to truth, and more important; that no province, or city, or per&s;on, &s;hall pretend, by virtue of any privilege or immunity, to be exempted from a general contribution. This is ju&s;t. But to confine it to a capitation, or per&s;onal tax, proportioned to the rent of hou&s;es or lodgings, would be in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the &s;ervice, even if it were po&s;&s;ible for the tax to be &s;trictly collected. A capitation can be no more than a &s;upplementary mea&s;ure. He pro&s;cribes the only taxes that can ever an&s;wer the demands of government, viz. tho&s;e upon edibles, luxury, and objects of con&s;tant u&s;e. The reader will find fre&s;h proofs of this a&s;&s;ertion in the &s;equel. All the&s;e &s;chemes have been already attempted in Holland, in the year 1748, with a view to &s;ub&s;titute one general tax in the room of all the duties upon con&s;umption. Specula|tions of this kind embarra&s;s the finances. They amu&s;e the people with hopes, and make them pay with more reluctance the taxes on which their own welfare and pre&s;ervation depend.
<PB N="129" REF="149">
The fir&s;t principle laid down in the <HI>Theory of Taxation,</HI> and in the <HI>Bilan of England,</HI> is, that a cultivating &s;tate has no revenue but the produce of the earth, and that the whole is collected within the territorial revenue. This might be true, if there were any &s;tate in Europe that confined it&s;elf merely to the cultivation of the &s;oil. The &s;tate of France, as well as of England, is compo&s;ed of farmers, &s;hepherds, fi&s;hermen, hunters, merchants, manufacturers, arti&s;ts, and &s;oldiers. Why then &s;hould we reduce the various produce of all the branches to the annual return of territorial revenue? Is it not repre&s;enting the colo&s;&s;us of France under the figure of a &s;keleton? The principle, that the territorial produce is to be con&s;idered as the only &s;ource of revenue, has &s;educed many people; yet it is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e, as well as the con&s;equence drawn from it, that taxes &s;hould be laid at the &s;ource of production; a maxim de|&s;tructive to cultivation, and that counteracts the author's purpo&s;e. To prove, with &s;till &s;tronger evidence, that it does &s;o, let us draw a &s;hort analytical picture of all the kinds of property, of which a &s;tate is compo&s;ed. We &s;hall then di&s;cover from what &s;ources an exact account of the finances of a kingdom is to be collected, and &s;ee at once upon what articles taxes may be impo&s;ed with the lea&s;t degree of inconvenience, and in what cla&s;s each &s;tate is to be reckoned.</P>
<P>Landed property is the fir&s;t. This is incapable of being de&s;troyed; but its value, more or le&s;s, depends upon cultivation, and without labor it makes no return. Its productions are neither voluntary, nor gratuitous. They require not only care, but expence; and before they nouri&s;h, they employ. But the annual fruits of the earth are con&s;umed, and at the end of the year cea&s;e to exi&s;t; or, if con&s;umption fails, they putrify, and are lo&s;t. The &s;tate can only be enriched by the internal con|&s;umption,
<PB N="130" REF="150">
and by the &s;urplus exported to foreigners. In this fir&s;t cla&s;s I reckon arable lands, woods, and vineyards.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind of property, which Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau has almo&s;t forgotten, and yet is very con&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ts of cattle, and the fields where they are fed. Cattle return more to the earth than they take from it. Some give milk twice a day, which &s;upplies us with chee&s;e. The ox not only con|tributes his labor to our &s;ervice, but even his fle&s;h and his &s;kin. The &s;heep furni&s;hes the fir&s;t elements of the mo&s;t u&s;eful manu|factures. Wool is a &s;ource of riches to England and Spain.</P>
<P>The fi&s;heries are a third kind of property. The &s;ea con|tributes to nouri&s;h the inhabitants of the earth, as much as the earth it&s;elf, with &s;till le&s;s expence. The great fi&s;heries form an article of con&s;iderable importance in commerce, yet omitted in the Theory of Taxation.</P>
<P>Hou&s;es are the fourth. The rent, or the occupation, is &s;o much real revenue. The object it&s;elf is peri&s;hable, but nece&s;&s;ity and luxury keep it in con&s;tant repair. The laborer, the mechanic, and the arti&s;t, are employed.</P>
<P>The fifth kind of property con&s;i&s;ts of &s;hips, wares, maga|zines, and in &s;hort of that innumerable detail of commercial articles, which furni&s;h &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to a prodigious multitude of people, and produce immen&s;e &s;ums every year, at the &s;ame time that the offices performed by money are multiplied by circulation. The revenue of this branch is of far different importance from that of the territorial produce, to which we are told that every thing &s;hould be reduced.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth kind con&s;i&s;ts of notes, public funds, actions, royal &s;ecurities bearing intere&s;t, the fruits or intere&s;t of which are not de&s;troyed by con&s;umption, like tho&s;e of the earth, but are permanent and unperi&s;hable, and multiply in every hand they
<PB N="131" REF="151">
pa&s;s through, yet, under the au&s;pices of credit and circulation, pre&s;erve their fertility. This (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the true principles of finance) is the rea&s;on why a numerary, exceeding all the money in Europe, is an|nually expended in Paris and London, and why the &s;tate can levy &s;o many taxes without ruin to the nation; a paradox, which &s;peculative financiers are unable to comprehend, becau&s;e they have no true idea of circulation and credit. The&s;e are the powers that create and multiply, that give life and activity, that produce and reproduce. They &s;uffer nothing to &s;top or &s;tag|nate, but remove all ob&s;tructions, and circulate the blood through every vein.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh kind of property con&s;i&s;ts of places of honor, offices and employments. From this &s;ource a number of per&s;ons are &s;upplied with the means of expence, from which others again derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Indu&s;try and circulation are encouraged, and the public revenue improved, even by tho&s;e who live at the expence of it.</P>
<P>The eighth kind con&s;i&s;ts of magazines of all &s;orts, fixtures, jewelry, trinkets, diamonds, gold and &s;ilver plate, curio&s;ities, pictures, and books; all which augment the numerary, and, notwith&s;tanding their &s;low circulation, contribute to &s;upport credit, and to prop the building.</P>
<P>The ninth con&s;i&s;ts of manufactures, principally tho&s;e for exportation, by which foreigners are laid under contribution, and the &s;ubject enriched. Tho&s;e of Lyons, and other places in France, far from de&s;troying agriculture, encourage it. But this might be the &s;ubject of another di&s;&s;ertation, and would lead me too far. In the Elogium of Sully, one of the ma&s;ter-pieces of Mon&s;ieur Thomas, there is an argument upon this point, which appears to me too bold.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="152">
The tenth is a &s;upernumerary to France. I mean the multitude of foreigners, whom curio&s;ity attracts to Paris, and plea&s;ure detains there. Their expence is a real nume|rary, which not only augments that of the kingdom, but at the &s;ame time increa&s;es the materials and circulation of &s;pecie. Combined with the expences of tho&s;e, through whom their money circulates, it improves the &s;overeign's revenue, which, though never &s;tationary in his hands, always exi&s;ts within the nation. The exorbitant price of furni&s;hed lodgings at Paris and upon the road, and the hire of carriages for the u&s;e of foreigners, is a kind of territorial produce, created by foreigners, without the charges of exportation.</P>
<P>The eleventh kind of property, con&s;i&s;ting of mines of coal, tin, and iron, where there are any, has e&s;caped Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau.</P>
<P>Such is the true picture of the riches of a country, widely different from that impoveri&s;hed &s;tate pre&s;ented to us in the Theory of Taxation. In this picture the apparent con|tradictions between the objects and the produce of taxes, as well as between the faculties of the &s;ubject and the de|mands of the &s;tate, are reconciled. The gradation of taxes, according to this faithful repre&s;entation, &s;hould proceed in the inver&s;e ratio to that of Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's &s;y&s;tem. The &s;ources of production, the earth and its fir&s;t harve&s;t, &s;hould be loaded lea&s;t of all. The progre&s;s of taxes &s;hould follow the detail of con&s;umption, and multiply upon every article of luxury. The mode of collection is another object, the abu&s;es of which I am not qualified to di&s;cu&s;s. But taxes return for the mo&s;t part into the hand that pays them; and this, I pre&s;ume, is the line of direction upon which the whole my&s;tery of finance dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nds. In time it may be carried to perfection. For the pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of circu|lation
<PB N="133" REF="153">
the revenues of France amount to at lea&s;t ten times the &s;um &s;tated in the Theory of Taxation; and that it is ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that a man, who&s;e income is but four hundred millions, pays &s;ix. If, as it is &s;aid, the collection co&s;ts near a third of the produce, it is certainly a &s;hameful depredation; but quaere, whether Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau be not again mi&s;taken in his a&s;&s;ertion. The principles I adhere to are founded upon facts, and on the uniform experience of England, France, and Hol|land. They do not therefore involve &s;uch contradictions as appear upon the face of &s;peculative writings, which flatter the people without giving them any real con&s;olation or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;e them a relief not to be reali&s;ed in practice, and which they never can receive. It is the univer&s;al remedy, or philo&s;opher's &s;tone, perpetually &s;ought after, and never to be di&s;covered. A nation that would &s;ubmit to pay heavy taxes without reluctance, and that, as the author &s;uppo&s;es, would pay them from a &s;pirit of emulation, and where the application of the revenue &s;hould be con&s;tantly directed to the public good, without any part of it being diverted, would be a nation of angels, or rather of gods, and &s;uch a one as never will exi&s;t upon this ma&s;s of earth. My own &s;y&s;tem is reducible to this con|clu&s;ion. 1^o. That the pretended principle, of confining the whole contributive faculty of taxes entirely to the territorial produce, is fallacious; for, though the landed revenue forms an important article, it is &s;till the &s;malle&s;t portion of the facul|ties of the &s;ubject. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While this work was in the pre&s;s, I met with a new treati&s;e, entitled "Dialogues on the Corn Trade." The remarks it contains are excellent, u&s;eful, brilliant, profound, and in&s;tructive. In this book the cultivation and exportation of corn are placed in their true point of view, without enthu&s;ia&s;m. Notwith&s;tanding the familiar &s;tyle of dialogue, every article is treated analytically. I found in it &s;ome of my own ideas. In other in&s;tances, where my ideas were loo&s;e and confu&s;ed, I found my&s;elf corrected.

That to lay taxes at the &s;ource of

production would injure agriculture, which ought to be pro|tected and encouraged at its &s;ource by every privilege and recom|pence imaginable. 3^o. That nothing but articles of con&s;umption and luxury can produce a revenue proportioned to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate; and that it is proved by practice and experience, that circulation in a great mea&s;ure repairs the inconveniences that may be occa&s;ioned by taxes. 4^o. That the mode of col|lection &s;hould be the lea&s;t expen&s;ive or burthen&s;ome to the nation, taking particular care not to oppre&s;s the farmer; but this is a difficult point. Let me add, 5^o. That the &s;tate of ex|ports at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e is the thermometer of a flouri&s;hing commerce, in a farming and manufacturing nation; that duties upon exports &s;hould be moderate; and that exportation, in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;hould be encouraged by bounties.</P>
<P>Importation is of a different nature. It is a tribute paid to foreigners. In France and England it may be loaded without inconvenience, except the fir&s;t elements of manufactures, which ought to be free. It is not the &s;ame with a power entirely commercial, &s;uch as Holland, that buys in order to &s;ell, and to which the carrying trade is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. The con|&s;titution of Holland is &s;ingular and peculiar, and the country mu&s;t be governed by rules that are an exception to all others. It is a phenomenon in politics. Hi&s;tory gives us no model of &s;uch a con&s;titution. The thermometer of import and export at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e in Holland, is &s;ometimes in an inver&s;e ratio
<PB N="135" REF="155">
to what it is in other countries. In this place it may be proper to in&s;ert a fine ob&s;ervation, which I lately met with in an Engli&s;h author. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the bounty, granted by government upon the exportation of corn, is an expence to the &s;tate, or that the revenue &s;uffers a diminution of &pound;. 150,000 which the bounty amounts to. But this, &s;ays the author, is a mi&s;take; for the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e recovers that &s;um with intere&s;t, by that increa&s;e in the duties on imports, which ari&s;es from a large exportation of corn. A con&s;iderable part of this export is exchanged for articles of luxury, which the nation is fond of, and which pay heavy duties at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. So that the encouragement given to agriculture turns to the profit of the cu&s;toms. There is another ob&s;ervation equally curious, that the price of corn has not ri&s;en in England, &s;ince the in&s;titution of the bounty, nor even &s;o far back as &s;ince the time of Ed|ward III. making allowance for the different value of the mark of &s;ilver at the different periods. I have &s;hown that France might follow this example, and encourage agriculture, yet without any diminution of the opulence of England.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur de Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, that a tax upon per&s;ons is the mo&s;t natural to &s;lavery, and a tax upon merchandi&s;es the mo&s;t natural to liberty, becau&s;e it does not refer &s;o directly to the per&s;on. A capitation can never &s;upply the place of every other tax, on account of the &s;mall number of per&s;ons on whom it would fall, in proportion to the multitude who, through the medium of con&s;umption, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;well the revenue, at the &s;ame time that the very money they pay is furni&s;hed in the la&s;t re&s;ort by the wealthy, on whom alone it is meant that the weight of the capitation &s;hould fall. Natural con&s;umption, and even that of luxury, by means of a circulation multiplied
<PB N="136" REF="156">
through various channels, can alone &s;upply &s;uch con&s;iderable &s;ums, without exhau&s;ting the &s;ources, or &s;topping the current of circulation.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid it follows, 6^o. That the trea&s;ury re|&s;tores to the public the money it receives, increa&s;ing the con|tributive faculty by the annuities and pen&s;ions it pays. The retribution, however, is not always exactly equal, with re&s;pect to individuals, but mu&s;t be taken in gro&s;s. 7^o. That the pub|lic funds increa&s;e riches, commerce, indu&s;try, con&s;umption, and the contributive faculty. They are nece&s;&s;ary in them&s;elves, and differ widely from the idea hitherto conceived of them. 8^o. That neverthele&s;s the public debt &s;hould be redeemed to a certain point, in order to dimini&s;h taxes, which always appear to be an evil, con&s;tantly magnified by opinion; otherwi&s;e, if they were multiplied too far, &s;ome great difficulties would ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e fatal wars, which recur too often. 9^o. That the true and exact di&s;tribution of all the branches of finance is a &s;cience, all the principles of which are not yet under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="10">10^o. That good order is not de&s;troyed by exacting a con|tribution to the public &s;tock, from all tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s no capital, but live upon the retribution yielded to their labor. They receive it from the rich, from people in ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and even from the &s;tate.

12^o. To deny, as Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau does, the reality of that &s;ucce&s;&s;ive enjoyment, which credit and circulation procure to every individual with the &s;ame &s;pecie, and to treat this truth as a plau&s;ible fallacious hypothe&s;is, is as much as to affirm, that there is nothing intrin&s;ically valuable but bread and water, and that every thing el&s;e is a &s;uperfluity of mere convention and opinion. At this rate one might affirm, that the landlord of a thou&s;and acres in fact po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but two feet when he &s;tands up, and &s;ix when he lies down, becau&s;e this is all the &s;pace he occupies. The &s;ophi&s;try is the &s;ame. Gold and &s;ilver, as &s;igns, have no real intrin&s;ic advantage over the objects, which multiply &s;pecie through the medium of circula|tion, and repre&s;ent it through the medium of credit.</P>
<P N="13">13^o. The capital, in every country, is the central focus of con&s;umption and luxury. Some benefits ari&s;e from it. The country round the capital is improved. Still however it is &s;aid to produce a number of mi&s;chiefs. If the population of the metropolis bears no proportion to the re&s;t of the kingdom, the provinces may langui&s;h, the limbs of the political body may decay. The reader will &s;ee my opinion of the matter in the Fourth Chapter. An admini&s;tration, that &s;hould correct the bad effects of this di&s;proportion, and give life to the provinces, would render an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="14">14^o. The accumulated expence, which the &s;prings of cir|culation enable every individual to &s;upport, is the &s;ource of taxa|tion. If, as Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau affirms, the total amounts to &s;ix hundred and twenty-five millions that circulate through the &s;tate, this is the block out of which taxes are cut. He &s;ays, he has proved in another place, that the ma&s;s of coined <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau writes <HI>pecule,</HI> which conveys no &s;en&s;e in this pa&s;&s;age.

Every thing el&s;e, &s;ays he, is only circulation. I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with this great principle, which, after all, may be a fal&s;e one. But it has been proved that the total revenue con&s;iderably exceeds the territorial produce; that the return of circulation, from which he collects his &s;tate of expence, is infinitely greater than the ma&s;s of &s;pecie. Its exi&s;tence in the public trea&s;ury is tran&s;itory and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, but not the le&s;s real.

<P N="15">15^o. From what has been &s;aid, I would not have it un|der&s;tood that I any way deny the importance of agriculture, or the nece&s;&s;ity of protecting it. What I affirm is, that to make it the only object, the univer&s;al in&s;trument, the general agent, is a mere whim, <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The encouragement of manufactures has long &s;ince cea&s;ed to be a favo|rite, or rather a fa&s;hionable theme, among tho&s;e French political writers, who have the good of their country mo&s;t vehemently at heart. Within the&s;e few years it has been di&s;covered in France, that their neglect of agriculture, and their attention to manufactures, have been the ruin of the nation. The upright and ingenious Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau was one of the fir&s;t, who &s;ounded the alarm to his countrymen, and warned them of the danger of providing for the luxuries at the expence of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Every ignorant pamphleteer now takes up the argument where Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau left it, and carries it to an extreme that is only not ridiculous in a Frenchman. Surpri&s;ed at the extraordinary efforts made and &s;upported by the Engli&s;h nation, and &s;truck with the &s;ingularity of our giving a bounty upon the exportation of corn, they conceive that our only or principal re&s;ource depends upon agriculture; and that, in order to acquire and maintain a &s;uperiority over us, proportioned to their greater extent of territory and number of inhabitants, they have nothing to do but to de&s;troy their looms, and &s;end all France to the plough.

Peace removes all impediments, creates plenty, encourages population, increa&s;es con&s;umption, extends commerce, and quickens cultivation; while the&s;e, in their turn, augment the revenue.

<P N="17">17^o. A capitation can never be any thing, in practice, but a &s;upplementary mea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="18">18^o. The &s;pecious principle of the Theory of Taxation, <Q>"That idlene&s;s is the lo&s;s, and labor the profit of the &s;tate,"</Q> is an axiom without meaning; pompous words, that promi&s;e much, and &s;ignify nothing. An idle man, who&s;e expence is decent, who pays taxes, who gives wages, who&s;e money cir|culates, who cau&s;es a u&s;eful con&s;umption, and &s;upplies others with the means of doing the &s;ame, is not a burthen to the &s;tate. It is mere &s;ophi&s;try under the ma&s;k of a &s;entence. Labor is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, but it is not always a profit to the &s;tate, unle&s;s it be a kind of labor that bears &s;ome analogy to the public welfare. The golden mine to the &s;tate is hone&s;t indu&s;try, not mere labor. Many a man labors to his own ruin, as well as to that of the &s;tate. So true it is that &s;pecious &s;entences, when thoroughly examined, are frequently no more than &s;ounding expre&s;&s;ions. We may reckon in the &s;ame cla&s;s another apothegm of Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, <Q>"That all labor is receipt, and that all idlene&s;s is expence, to the exchequer."</Q> Fine words without reality.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="142" REF="162">
19^o. I mu&s;t again repeat that, as things are now con|&s;tituted, circulation and credit mu&s;t be rckoned in the fir&s;t rank among the means of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P N="20">20^o. The eternal oppo&s;ition, to which the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary taxes are expo&s;ed, make them at once more burthen&s;ome, and le&s;s beneficial.</P>
<P N="21">21^o. Of all the kinds of property in a kingdom, manu|factures &s;uffer the mo&s;t by taxes. If the price of labor, or of raw materials, be ever &s;o little rai&s;ed, it becomes impo&s;|&s;ible to export in competition with foreigners. Yet there are ea&s;es, in which a cultivating nation, with a great extent of territory, may flouri&s;h, and become as powerful as its condition admits, by the mere indu&s;try of an internal commerce, with|out any con&s;iderable intercour&s;e with foreigners.</P>
<P N="22">22^o. Independent of taxes, wherever there is mo&s;t wealth, there every thing will be the deare&s;t. From hence I conjecture, that France is not &s;o wealthy as England. The gentry in England, I believe, are much richer than in France; whereas the higher nobility, including the princes of the blood, are richer in France. The middle rank in England undoubtedly has the advantage. The pea&s;ant, the laborer, and mechanic, are much more at their ea&s;e. Riches in general are much more equally di&s;per&s;ed through the Engli&s;h than through the French people; yet, in particular in&s;tances, there may always be exceptions. A &s;ingle branch of manufacture may decline. Two hundred workmen, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and out of employment, make as much clamor with their di&s;tre&s;s, as if the whole world were peri&s;hing with hunger. The echo is repeated on all &s;ides; the enemies of government join the chorus; and they, who li&s;ten to their clamors, think every thing is lo&s;t. To judge truly, we &s;hould extend our view to the whole ma&s;s.</P>

<P N="25">25^o. Certainly nothing can be more de&s;tructive than the deva&s;tation which ari&s;es from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the farmer, and per&s;ecution in matter of religion. The ravages of war are tran&s;itory, and the &s;oil by degrees recovers from its own ruins. The value of it may be annihilated by the rapine of finance, and I believe it has &s;ometimes happened &s;o in France; but the wi&s;dom of government is employed in correcting this abu&s;e.</P>
<P N="26">26^o. Another of Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's great maxims is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it is better to &s;ell the raw materials, than to abate any thing of the fir&s;t price, in favor of manufactures, which, with re&s;pect to profit, have no other object but the price of the labor; a profit which, in fact, is only a return of the money it co&s;ts."</Q> This ob&s;ervation de&s;erves to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="27">27^o. He &s;ays, that an unlimited power of impo&s;ing taxes would de&s;troy all the rights of property, and, after ruining the nation, lay fetters upon it&s;elf. The &s;ubject cannot pay beyond his &s;trength. An arbitrary tax could not fail of defeating its own purpo&s;e. There mu&s;t be a proportion between the tax, on one &s;ide, and the nature of the thing on which it falls, and the per&s;ons who pay it (whether for luxury or nece&s;&s;ity) on the other. The produce of the earth undoubtedly ari&s;es from a combination of two agents, the labor of man, and the bounty

of nature. To &s;eparate them, &s;ays Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, is the great object of finance. He thinks that, by his method, he can di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;heaf that belongs to cultivation, and that which belongs to revenue. But his metaphy&s;ics in finance can never be reduced to practice.</P>
<P N="28">28^o. He &s;ays, that war is the mo&s;t &s;evere and fatal accident to a &s;tate. The revenue of the nation dimini&s;hes, while its expences increa&s;e. The greate&s;t contribution is demanded when there is the lea&s;t ability to pay it. To avoid war as much as po&s;&s;ible, is the only remedy. The expedient, pointed out by the author, of providing a public trea&s;ure again&s;t unfore&s;een accidents, would increa&s;e the evil, becau&s;e a con&s;iderable quan|tity of &s;pecie locked up would ob&s;truct circulation, the effect of which is proportioned not to the &s;um, but to its current activity. The trea&s;ure mu&s;t either be very con&s;iderable or u&s;ele&s;s. If it were &s;ufficient to &s;upport a war for two years only, it would do the nation incomparably greater mi&s;chief, than the evil we endea|vour to avoid. Hi&s;tory proves that the reign of di&s;&s;ipation, which u&s;ually &s;ucceeds the reign of oeconomy, does infinite prejudice to the &s;tate. Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau gives no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the&s;e objections. He pretends that the fortunes made, and depredations committed, by the farmers general, are incon|veniences without any mixture of benefit. It is not &s;o; the&s;e pretended fortunes circulate through the public.</P>
<P N="29">29^o. The indirect channels and &s;trainers, through which taxes are drawn, &s;hould be made as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible, in order to reduce the expence of collection. But pulling down the hou&s;e is not the way to &s;trengthen the foundation.</P>
<P N="30">30^o. It is not credit that has ruined the finances of France, as Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau pretends. On the contrary, it was the failure of credit in time of need, that did the mi&s;chief, and
<PB N="145" REF="165">
probably was the chief cau&s;e of the late di&s;a&s;ters. If credit had been &s;upported as it might have been, France would have been le&s;s in debt. At the beginning of the year 1715, the king was obliged to negotiate thirty-two millions in bills, in order to rai&s;e eight in &s;pecie. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voltaire, Age of Lewis XIV. ch. 28.</NOTE> <NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems hardly credible, and yet it is unque&s;tionably true, that Lewis XIV. a little before his death, in order to rai&s;e eight millions in &s;pecie, for which he had a pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, was obliged to make u&s;e of the credit of a private per&s;on and his partners, to circulate re&s;criptions, or a&s;&s;ignments upon the revenue, to the amount of thirty-two millions, chiefly among foreigners; &s;o that, for every hundred he received, he incurred a debt of four hundred. No wonder that, at this rate, he left a debt of above one hundred and eighty-four millions &s;terling. The fir&s;t advice given to the regent was to make a general bankruptcy. Money at that time was &s;o &s;carce, that the be&s;t bills could not be di&s;counted at le&s;s than twenty, twenty-five, or thirty per cent.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE> If faith had been kept to the public creditor as inviolably in France, as it has been in England, half the pre&s;ent debt might have been avoided; the rate of intere&s;t would have been le&s;s than half what it is, and the &s;tate have gained infinitely more than it has done by tho&s;e violent operations, which have annihilated credit. Expen&s;ive operations of finance, together with exorbitant intere&s;t, ari&s;ing from nothing but want of credit, have cau&s;ed debts to be contracted without value received. On one &s;ide, the funds to &s;upport the war were borrowed at a higher intere&s;t; on the other, failure of credit rai&s;ed the price of every article purcha&s;ed for the &s;ervice. In this view the inconvenience is double; not to reckon lo&s;s of time, which follows want of credit, and makes every operation ineffectual. To find the &s;upplies at the exact moment, or at the moment afterwards, determines the &s;ucce&s;s of a campaign. Superior credit undoubtedly was the principal cau&s;e of the other advantages, which England had over France in the la&s;t war,
<PB N="146" REF="166">
becau&s;e it enabled the nation to exert and avail it&s;elf of the re&s;t. The fact has been confirmed by other proofs in the fir&s;t Chapter. It depended only upon France her&s;elf to have re-e&s;tabli&s;hed her credit, if peace, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Europe, could have been firmly &s;ecured.</P>
<P>It may be laid down as certain, that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of public funds depends upon the following regulations and cir|cum&s;tances. 1^o. That the loans be national; that is, that the body of the nation &s;hall be an&s;werable for them, as in England; and although the French parliament is far from having the &s;ame weight in the con&s;titution with that of England, yet the par|liamentary creation of funds, and the &s;ecurity of that augu&s;t body, would contribute not a little to &s;upport the credit of them. 2^o. That funds to pay the intere&s;t &s;hould be &s;ecured, without the po&s;&s;ibility of interruption; and that every loan &s;hould have its &s;eparate &s;ecurity. 3^o. That the &s;inking fund be faithfully applied to the di&s;charge of debt, and that its operation be uniform and uninterrupted. 4^o. That, in order to gain the confidence of the public, every mea&s;ure of finance be laid open, and all appearance of my&s;tery bani&s;hed. 5^o. That with the &s;ame view an a&s;&s;urance be given to the nation, and to foreigners, with re&s;pect to future operations, that their intere&s;t &s;hall never be reduced under any pretence what&s;oever, without offering to repay the principal; and that the principal &s;hall, at no time hereafter, be &s;ubject to any tax or defalcation, as it has happened heretofore; that in this re&s;pect the example of the Engli&s;h &s;hall be followed, and that a loan of a hundred &s;hall be always paid off at par, notwith&s;tanding any &s;pecious arguments to the contrary; that this e&s;&s;ential article &s;hall no longer depend upon the mini&s;ter's way of thinking. When the &s;ecurity offered
<PB N="147" REF="167">
by government is intimately united with that of the parliament, the public confidence may then be recovered.</P>
<P>Credit and confidence being re&s;tored upon this &s;olid founda|tion, the French government will gain infinitely more by following the &s;ame plan inviolably, than they have hitherto gained by operations of a different nature. The rate of intere&s;t will be lowered, and when money is wanted, it will be rai&s;ed without difficulty upon moderate terms. I &s;peak of the future; but what I &s;ay is founded upon experience, not upon theory or &s;peculation. It is the hi&s;tory of credit, &s;tated with &s;implicity, zeal, and hone&s;t intentions. There are other mea&s;ures, by which it is po&s;&s;ible to di&s;charge a con&s;iderable portion of debt, and to recover credit for a time; but it will fail when the occa|&s;ion is mo&s;t critical and important. I believe that France might have had &s;ome advantages over England, that would in part have compen&s;ated for the difference of the two con&s;titutions, and given her a credit and circulation almo&s;t as exten&s;ive as that of the Engli&s;h, if proper mea&s;ures had been &s;eriou&s;ly taken, and the peace had la&s;ted long enough to have carried them into execution. But after all the confu&s;ion that has happened, this is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of a day.</P>
<P N="31">31^o. I have already &s;hown, that exce&s;&s;ive luxury is as ruinous to a nation, as an expence, proportioned to the wealth of indi|viduals and their rank in life, is beneficial to it. A man ruined is a fruitful plant withered up, with re&s;pect to the public; his numerary wealth does not exi&s;t within the nation, as many people think, who do not under&s;tand the laws of circu|lation, and the nature of factitious property. Exce&s;&s;ive luxury &s;eems to encourage indu&s;try for a moment, and abandons it for ever. At the &s;ame time it corrupts the manners, enervates the &s;trength, and has always been one of the principal cau&s;es of the ruin of a &s;tate. It would be an important &s;ecret in legi&s;lation to
<PB N="148" REF="168">
find the middle term, at which exce&s;&s;ive luxury might be &s;topped, yet without enacting &s;umptuary laws to re&s;train that decent expence, which is allowed to every &s;ubject, in proportion to his rank and fortune.</P>
<P>The following quotation from the Spirit of the Laws may al&s;o be con&s;idered as a general rule. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Taxes may be increa&s;ed in proportion to the liberty of the &s;ubject. As &s;lavery gains ground, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be reduced. The rule is taken from nature, and never varies. It operates in every country, from England and Holland, through the various degradations of liberty, until it ends in Turkey. Switzerland &s;eems to be an exception. The Swi&s;s pay no taxes. But there is a particular rea&s;on for it, which confirms the rule. In tho&s;e barren mountains provi&s;ions are &s;o dear, and the country &s;o populous, that a Swi&s;s pays four times as much to nature, as a Turk does to the &s;ultan."</Q> If this principle be as evident as the author affirms, the con&s;equences to be drawn from it would confirm my &s;y&s;tem of taxation.</P>
<P>If it were po&s;&s;ible for England, by means of a continued peace, by the application of the &s;inking fund, and an increa&s;e of commerce, to di&s;charge almo&s;t all the national debt, it ought not to be done. It would be highly prejudicial to the kingdom not to pre&s;erve &s;ixty millions at lea&s;t of the&s;e fictitious trea|&s;ures. The u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of it has been already proved. If once the debt were reduced to this &s;um, parliament &s;hould relieve the nation from whatever taxes appeared the mo&s;t bur|then&s;ome, and employ the re&s;idue of the &s;inking fund in the encouragement of manufactures, the &s;ettlement of colonies, and in other u&s;eful enterpri&s;es. A total di&s;charge of the debt would be ab&s;olutely again&s;t the intere&s;t of the nation. I &s;hall be of the &s;ame opinion with re&s;pect to France, whenever the govern|ment

&s;hall have &s;ucceeded in giving currency to the royal &s;ecurities, and in re&s;toring the faith and credit of tho&s;e &s;ecurities at a lower rate of intere&s;t. This might ea&s;ily happen in a few years, if, in their future operations of finance, they would follow the &s;y&s;tem I propo&s;e. The French mini&s;try are too well informed not to know the intrin&s;ic contributive powers of the kingdom, and too humane to exact more than its &s;trength can &s;upport.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to be an ea&s;y way, as far as the nature of the thing will admit, to form a picture or barometer of the&s;e powers, by executing the plan laid down by Lewis XIV. in the year 1698, for the information of the duke of Burgundy.</P>

It were to be wi&s;hed, that each of them had given, in columns, the number of inhabitants in each election; the nobles, citizens, laborers, arti&s;ans, and mechanics; the cattle of every kind; the good, the indifferent, and the bad lands; all the clergy, regular and &s;ecular; their revenues, tho&s;e of the towns, and tho&s;e of the communities."</Q></P>

<HEAD>PART IV. <HI>New Con&s;iderations upon the &s;ame Subjects.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT has long been affirmed, that the kingdom of France, though enlarged by the acqui&s;ition of Franche Comt&eacute;, Al&s;ace, Lor|raine and French Flanders, has not more inhabitants than before tho&s;e acqui&s;itions were made. We are al&s;o told that the unequal di&s;tribution of taxes, the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by the Aides and Gabelles, the arbitrary land tax, and repair of the high roads, are the true and only cau&s;es of the depopulation of France; and that, in con&s;equence of taxes and oppre&s;&s;ion, large tracts of land, from which a con&s;iderable return was collected before the reign of Lewis XIV. are actually uncultivated. The general cry of the nation cannot be entirely without foundation. Rea&s;on, common &s;en&s;e, and experience, tell us, that, when the hu&s;|bandman is oppre&s;&s;ed, and the cultivation of the &s;oil co&s;ts &s;o much that the produce is hardly &s;ufficient to maintain him, he is compelled to abandon it. It is a general complaint, that all the duties impo&s;ed upon the tran&s;portation of commodities from one province to another, as well as upon exportation at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, are &s;o many fetters laid upon &s;ale and con|&s;umption, and mu&s;t dimini&s;h the revenue by the very means employed to improve it.</P>
<P>Without doubt there is a great deal of truth in the&s;e com|plaints. The vexations they refer to mu&s;t have contributed in part to the wa&s;te of &s;o much land; but I cannot per&s;uade
<PB N="154" REF="174">
my&s;elf that they were the principal cau&s;e of it. It mu&s;t rather be attributed to a &s;udden failure of con&s;umption, ari&s;ing from a violent and continued depopulation. This depopulation has proceeded chiefly from the long wars which Lewis XIV. carried on with armies much more numerous than ever were kept up by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. Since that period, a &s;ingle campaign de&s;troys more men than three campaigns in the time of Harry IV. The marine, navigation, and the colonies, prevent the progre&s;s of population. The revocation of the edict of Nantz, want of toleration, the multitude of religious of both &s;exes, and exce&s;&s;ive luxury, have done the re&s;t. Wars and colonies have al&s;o depopulated England, but not in the &s;ame proportion. 1^o. Becau&s;e the refugees have in &s;ome mea|&s;ure repaired the breach. 2^o. Becau&s;e there are fewer unmarried per&s;ons. 3^o. Becau&s;e their armies, be&s;ides being le&s;s numerous, have been compo&s;ed of foreigners. In &s;pite of the&s;e advantages depopulation begins to be felt in England. Projects to prevent it &s;ignify nothing. The great mi&s;chief is not to be repaired but by time and a continued peace, without which every other expedient will be found in&s;ufficient, u&s;ele&s;s, or impracticable.</P>
<P>France and England are as rich in land and money as they can be. Their wealth and power can receive no addition, but by collecting their &s;trength towards the centre of the &s;tate. Con|&s;umption increa&s;es circulation. A greater circulation creates new property, and gives life to all the riches of the &s;tate. A million of &s;ubjects more, &s;ettled in Great Britain, would add more to the revenue of the nation, and of the exchequer, and to the power of the &s;overeign, than all the produce of Canada and the colonies. France could maintain three or four millions more inhabitants. The circulation, produced by this increa&s;e of con&s;umption, would be more profitable to the &s;overeign than
<PB N="155" REF="175">
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mexico and Peru. The circulation of &s;pecie quickens rapidly as it pa&s;&s;es through the inferior ranks. It is the great con&s;umption of the multitude that enlarges the revenue. That part of the people in France has been dimi|ni&s;hed by wars, and want of toleration. Taxes have height|ened the mi&s;chief, and made it more &s;en&s;ibly felt; but they were not the cau&s;e of it. The wars of Lewis XIV. and the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have co&s;t more men than all the wars of the two preceding centuries. The depopulation of Germany will be felt in France and England, as well with re&s;pect to commerce, as to manufactures. The&s;e are lo&s;&s;es which a whole century cannot repair. Mon&s;ieur Voltaire has ob&s;erved upon this &s;ubject, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That Sir William Petty had proved, that for a nation to increa&s;e one twentieth in a hundred years requires the mo&s;t favorable circum&s;tances. His calculation &s;hows the folly of writers who people the earth with a &s;troke of their pen, and in a century or two cover the globe with inha|bitants. If it be a&s;ked, Why there is a third more people in England now, than in the time of Queen Elizabeth? the an&s;wer is exactly, Becau&s;e England has been in the mo&s;t favorable circum&s;tances; becau&s;e multitudes of Germans, Flemi&s;h, and French, have e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in the country; becau&s;e it is computed, that &s;ixty thou&s;and monks, ten thou&s;and nuns, and ten thou&s;and &s;ecular prie&s;ts, have been re&s;tored to propagation, and to the &s;tate; and becau&s;e popu|lation has been encouraged by plenty.

Population is not the work of a day. It may be encouraged in time of peace; but continual wars, in the modern &s;tyle, will defeat every mea&s;ure that the wi&s;e&s;t admini&s;tration can po&s;&s;ibly employ for this important purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have lately &s;een a very &s;carce and curious book, called <HI>A Detail of France under the pre&s;ent Reign,</HI> printed at Bru&s;&s;els in 1712.

It contains the &s;ub&s;tance of Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's Theory of Taxation, the remon&s;trances made by the parlia|ments, and all the vi&s;ionary projects of finance, with which France has been over-run, upon the &s;ubject of taxes, duties, cu&s;toms, agriculture, &amp;c. I &s;hall begin my remarks upon it with one preliminary ob&s;ervation. Though written before tho&s;e calamities, which attended the latter part of Lewis the XIVth's reign, it repre&s;ents the kingdom as then upon the verge of de&s;truction. Seventy years have &s;ince elap&s;ed, and in the cour&s;e of that time there has been a period, under the admi|ni&s;tration of Cardinal Fleury, at which commerce was carried to its greate&s;t extent, and every thing flouri&s;hed in the king|dom. Of three wars, which have happened within the la&s;t &s;eventy years, the &s;econd was ruinous, though accompanied with brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es; the third was very unfortunate. And yet I am convinced that France, after all her di&s;a&s;ters, is not in a wor&s;e condition than in the year 1698, when the book was fir&s;t publi&s;hed; though (&s;etting a&s;ide the conque&s;ts) the &s;tate of the kingdom may perhaps be wor&s;e than it was in the year 1660.
<PB N="157" REF="177">
Part of the abu&s;es, particularly the arbitrary land-tax, have been corrected; though it is but lately that the mini&s;try have been &s;eriou&s;ly employed in going to the bottom of tho&s;e vexations, which &s;top the progre&s;s of agriculture and commerce. The mea&s;ures they are now taking will, I believe, in time, produce con&s;iderable advantages; but I affirm that, without a la&s;ting peace to encourage population, which of it&s;elf increa&s;es con&s;umption, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t quicken circulation, all the expedients they can adopt will only give a momentary coloring to the &s;urface. The de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem, on which war has been carried on both by &s;ea and land, &s;ince the end of the la&s;t century, is the true primordial &s;ource of depopulation. The lo&s;s of con&s;umption, that follows it, le&s;&s;ens the relative revenue of the &s;overeign, and the &s;trength of the nation. If it were not for the factitious cir|culation created by loans, the ravages of war, and religious per&s;ecution, which have done &s;o much mi&s;chief to population and agriculture, would have been &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly felt. Let us con&s;ider this important que&s;tion again, and turn it in every po&s;&s;ible &s;hape. We cannot examine it with too much attention.</P>
<P>We vie with each other in prai&s;ing the Duke of Sully; and God forbid I &s;hould undervalue the di&s;tingui&s;hed merit of that great man. Yet it ought to be con&s;idered, that his upright in|tentions were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by circum&s;tances, of which the mini&s;ters who &s;ucceeded him had not the advantage.</P>
<P>France, ju&s;t relieved from the horrors of a civil war, was in the &s;ituation of a robu&s;t and vigorous young man, who, after a violent fit of &s;ickne&s;s, e&s;capes from the jaws of death with new &s;trength, and a healthier con&s;titution. The kingdom had not been impoveri&s;hed, becau&s;e the wars had been carried on chiefly within the country, or immediately upon the frontiers, and with &s;mall armies. Spain, in order to &s;upport the league, had
<PB N="158" REF="178">
&s;pent money enough in France to enrich the kingdom. The Huguenots had drawn large quantities of plate out of the churches and mona&s;teries, which was coined and circulated. The &s;eeds of opulence exi&s;ted every where. To unfold and bring them forward, required nothing but peace and a prudent admini&s;tration. Sully corrected the abu&s;es which oppo&s;ed this &s;alutary work, and gave life to every branch of admini&s;tration. The wants were incon&s;iderable, the re&s;ources were copious, and he availed him&s;elf of them all. The &s;plendor of his admini&s;|tration glitters to this day, and will never be eclip&s;ed in the eyes of po&s;terity. But it would be unju&s;t to expect that his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, under circum&s;tances of greater difficulty, &s;hould make an equal progre&s;s in the &s;ame time. France was like a beautiful woman ill dre&s;&s;ed, who wanted nothing but a better habit to appear with di&s;tinction. Harry IV. had none of that pomp which now is thought e&s;&s;ential to the lu&s;tre of the crown. Ver&s;ailles, Marli, Bellevue, which have &s;wallowed up &s;o much money, were not then in exi&s;tence. The wants of government are multiplied &s;ince that time. When &s;ickne&s;s and frequent bleeding have weakened the con&s;titution, it is with difficulty the convale&s;cent recovers.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved that, according to the <HI>Detail of France,</HI> Cardinal Richelieu, who &s;oon &s;ucceeded Sully, made an equal pro|gre&s;s in improving the finances; the king's revenue having doubled under the Cardinal's admini&s;tration. He was far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the merit of Sully, but the nerve of the &s;tate was &s;till in its vigor. <HI>Sully</HI> had &s;hown what it was capable of performing. We &s;hould apply to him what Monte&s;quieu &s;ays of Richelieu, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He drew the principles of the monarchy out of chaos, taught France the &s;ecret of her &s;trength, and Spain the &s;ecret of her weakne&s;s."</Q> In &s;pite of abu&s;es of admini&s;tration, the progre&s;s of improvement
<PB N="159" REF="179">
appeared more and more, until the work was completed by <HI>Colbert.</HI> This was the period of the highe&s;t pro&s;perity to France. From that time, the kingdom in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t its &s;trength by abu&s;ing it, in the mid&s;t, and even in con&s;equence, of the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es. They were purcha&s;ed with the lo&s;s of &s;o many men, that the &s;overeign, though con&s;tantly enlarging his dominion, and extending his frontiers, did not increa&s;e the number of his &s;ubjects. Land lo&s;t its value more and more, for want of cultivation and con&s;umption. In the&s;e circum&s;tances every tax upon land had a fatal effect; and if commerce and the circulation of government &s;ecurities had not, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, repaired the mi&s;chief, the kingdom would really have been reduced to that deplorable con|dition in which it has been de&s;cribed. The picture, now too much loaded, would then have been true. The fact is, that France has not increa&s;ed her power in proportion to her conque&s;ts; that the oppre&s;&s;ion of the hu&s;bandman, and the difficulties impo&s;ed upon commerce, both foreign and dome&s;tic, augment the evil; that failure of credit, in borrowing money, has made the matter wor&s;e; that the circulation, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, in &s;ome degree repairs the mi&s;chief; that the&s;e abu&s;es may and ought to be corrected; but that, without a continued peace, no remedy can be effectual.</P>
<P>I find, in the <HI>Detail</HI> of France, the &s;ame principle which I have already refuted; <HI>that all revenue is reduced to the territorial produce.</HI> This work however contains many excellent ob&s;erva|tions, though disfigured by exaggeration, or improperly applied. The author &s;ees every object with a micro&s;copic eye, and by con&s;tantly mixing error with truth, de&s;troys the utility of his work. It may be true, that the mode of levying a tax (whe|ther land tax, wine duty, or cu&s;toms) may be more grievous than the tax it&s;elf; and the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions may be con&s;idered as
<PB N="160" REF="180">
one rea&s;on why large tracts of land, which formerly made a great return, are now left uncultivated. The con&s;equences extend to con&s;umption and commerce, and even to population.</P>
<P>The author pretends that, in the year 1696, France had already lo&s;t half her wealth, and that the national revenue was le&s;s by five hundred millions than it was forty years before. He ob&s;erves that, from the death of Charles VII. in 1461 to the year 1660, the revenues of the kingdom had gradually doubled every thirty years; whereas it would appear that, &s;ince the year 1660, the king's revenue had only increa&s;ed about a third, (even including the conque&s;ts, all which pay a complete tithe to government) and that the national revenue had not quite increa&s;ed in the proportion of one half. He affirms, that any diminution in the revenue of land always occa&s;ions a diminution in the revenue of indu&s;try. The cau&s;e of the ruin of con&s;ump|tion, &s;ays he, is the only point we need enquire into. Two things e&s;&s;entially contribute to it; the uncertainty of the land tax, and the duties paid not only upon exportation at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, but upon conveyance from one province to another within the kingdom. Internal con&s;umption dimini&s;hes, exporta|tion is impo&s;&s;ible, and the produce of the earth peri&s;hes on the &s;pot where it grew. They, who by their employment are exempt from land tax, fling the whole burthen upon the mer|chant and mechanic, who have no fund but their indu&s;try. The author proves, by arguments equally &s;olid and ingenious, that the lo&s;s reverts even upon the per&s;ons who are exempted. He does not blame the taxes &s;o much as the mode of collecting them. He lays it down as a principle, that con&s;umption and revenue are the &s;ame, con&s;equently that any check to con&s;ump|tion is lo&s;s of revenue. The principle is true; but his applica|tion of it is defective, becau&s;e he con&s;iders nothing but the &s;oil.
<PB N="161" REF="181">
In his eyes nothing el&s;e has an exi&s;tence. 'Bating a few exag|gerations, all that he &s;ays is literally true with re&s;pect to cultivation, the produce of which might however be reduced to one half, without the whole kingdom's declining in the &s;ame proportion. He is deceived in thinking, that abu&s;es are the only cau&s;e of depopulation. Long wars are the principal occa&s;ion of it. I believe he exaggerates in &s;aying, that a duty, which only produces a hundred thou&s;and livres to the king, de&s;troys a con&s;umption equal to two millions upon the price or the quan|tity. This, in fact, means a diminution of two millions in revenue. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All the provinces (&s;ays he) lo&s;e for want of a commercial intercour&s;e with each other, and con&s;umption becomes impracticable."</Q> This abu&s;e undoubtedly was of a mo&s;t grievous nature; his whole argument upon the &s;ubject is clear and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Some of his principles are not &s;o evident. He &s;ays, for in&s;tance, that it is beyond contradiction, that a diminution in the revenue of land has dimini&s;hed the revenue of indu&s;try. The principle is not univer&s;ally true. In Holland and Switzerland the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil has improved the indu&s;try and reve|nue of the inhabitants. I make this ob&s;ervation, by the bye, to &s;how the fallacy of general rules. The author &s;aw that, from a concurrence of various circum&s;tances, the province of Normandy and the election of Mantes were fallen to decay; and that taxes, provincial duties, and other exactions, were the principal cau&s;e of it. He was &s;truck with &s;everal ab&s;tract truths re&s;pecting circulation, con&s;umption, the connection of intere&s;ts, and &s;ocial harmony of all the orders of the &s;tate. He compared the hi&s;tory of the preceding century with that of his own; and all the&s;e ideas, &s;eparately true in them&s;elves, mixed with the zeal of patrioti&s;m, and fermented in his mind. The
<PB N="162" REF="182">
volume of every object &s;welled in his view beyond its &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance. He exaggerates every thing, and with the &s;ure&s;t principles and deepe&s;t knowledge mi&s;leads the under&s;tanding. His idea of the general &s;tate of the kingdom was collected from what he &s;aw in Normandy, and the election of Mantes. He &s;ays, that the difficulty of communication between one pro|vince and another has &s;unk the value of their re&s;pective produce, at the &s;ame time that duties upon exportation have annihilated commerce, and impoveri&s;hed the kingdom. All this may, in &s;ome degree, be true; but to pretend that it has dimini&s;hed the revenue of the kingdom one half, that it has occa&s;ioned an annual lo&s;s of fifteen hundred millions, be&s;ides de&s;troying millions of &s;ubjects, and that all this may be recovered in four-and-twenty hours, and with a few days labor, is to the la&s;t degree extravagant. Writers, who have followed him in treating the &s;ame &s;ubject, have &s;oftened his exaggerations, which time had confuted; yet &s;till they almo&s;t all go too far, not being able to renounce their fir&s;t fal&s;e principle, <HI>that every thing is compre|hended in the territorial produce;</HI> nor con&s;idering, that &s;ucce&s;&s;ive wars have been the chief cau&s;e of depopulation, and that con|&s;umption of cour&s;e dimini&s;hed for want of con&s;umers. Yet there are a number of fine and u&s;eful remarks in this work, provided we confine them to their true value. The author had a tolerably clear idea of circulation; yet even this he carries too far. He &s;ays, for in&s;tance, that a hundred crowns, taken from the laborer for the expence of collection, create a lo&s;s of five or &s;ix thou&s;and livres to the body of the &s;tate. He repeatedly a&s;&s;erts, that in his time the revenues of France had &s;unk above fifteen hundred millions in the &s;pace of forty years; whereas the increa&s;e of revenue to the &s;overeign, which occa&s;ioned that lo&s;s, was not more than a hundred millions. All this proves too
<PB N="163" REF="183">
much. If in fact there be &s;uch quantities of land in France entirely de&s;erted becau&s;e the produce does not an&s;wer the expence of cultivation, I believe that means might be found to cultivate it on the king's account. I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that nobody has yet &s;eriou&s;ly thought of carrying &s;uch a project into execution. It would appear perhaps to be the mo&s;t beneficial and practicable &s;cheme that has yet been imagined. The operation of a few millions employed by the king in rein&s;tating his own &s;ubjects, who are reduced to mi&s;ery, and in &s;ecuring a portion of property to foreigners, would &s;hortly be felt. A&s;&s;i&s;ted by peace and commerce, it would &s;oon re&s;tore population, con&s;umption, and circulation, revive the paralytic branches of the &s;tate, and in a few years con&s;iderably increa&s;e the revenue of the &s;overeign, yet le&s;&s;en the burthen of taxes. Such a plan of agriculture might be executed in England with &s;till greater ea&s;e and expedition. In France there are more ob&s;tacles to be removed. The rubbi&s;h of old ruins would at fir&s;t retard the con&s;truction of a new building. All difficulties of communication between the provinces, all checks upon exportation, &s;hould be previou&s;ly removed. The oppre&s;&s;ions heaped upon the farmer &s;hould cea&s;e. The privileges, as well as the property granted to foreigners, &s;hould be firmly &s;ecured. A plan of this nature may be reckoned among the number of political vi&s;ions. Yet &s;ome of my readers may be &s;en&s;ible of the value of it, e&s;pecially when they ob&s;erve the &s;ucce&s;s it has already had in the following example. Fre|derick William of Pru&s;&s;ia formed the project, and had the good fortune to carry it into execution. His country was a va&s;t de&s;ert. With an expence of only twelve millions of florins he cleared the land, built villages, and filled them with inhabitants. He brought whole families from Suabia and Franconia. He invited emigrants from Saltzbourg, and &s;upplied them with the means
<PB N="164" REF="184">
of &s;ettling, and with implements of labor. He formed a new &s;tate, which gave him a new power. Europe has felt the weight of it, without profiting by the example. Such an in&s;tance is worth more than a hundred treati&s;es upon agriculture and finance. The Engli&s;h have done the &s;ame, in many parts of America, that Frederick William did in Europe, with &s;ingular advantages to the nation. The premature population of the colonies has not much weakened Great Britain, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h have had accidents in their favor. The multitude of refugees who &s;ettled in England after the revocation of the edict of Nantz, as well as of emigrants from Germany and el&s;ewhere, enabled them to people their colonies without depopulating the mother country. Yet if, on the Pru&s;&s;ian plan, they had begun by improving the whole of their &s;oil in Europe, and encouraged population as far as the extent of their territory and commercial advantages might admit, I believe their power would have been fixed upon a more &s;olid foundation. The &s;ub&s;equent &s;ettlement of colonies would have proceeded with &s;o much the more rapidity, as the kingdom would then have men to &s;pare, and wanted a vent for the &s;urplus of its &s;ubjects. England and France may yet be in this &s;ituation, if the divine &s;y&s;tem of peace &s;hould pre|vail through the principal courts of Europe. In the mean time it is ab&s;urd to deny, that the Engli&s;h derive e&s;&s;ential advantages from their colonies. The apprehen&s;ion, that the American colonies may one day become independent of the mother coun|try, is, for the pre&s;ent, a mere chimera. That event at lea&s;t can only be looked forward to in a very di&s;tant per&s;pective. Exclu&s;ive of the example of the Spaniards, who have long been the &s;ubject of the&s;e gratuitous predictions, it is certain that the Engli&s;h colonies can never enter into alliances dangerous to the mother country, as well from the connection of their intere&s;t
<PB N="165" REF="185">
with Great Britain, as from the &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip which prevails among them&s;elves. None of the&s;e countries &s;eparately can ever arrive at independence, and to unite them is impo&s;&s;ible. With a moderate degree of con&s;i&s;tency in the admini&s;tration at home, Great Britain will long pre&s;erve her authority over the&s;e va&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hments. In theory they may perplex the politician, but the management of them in fact will ea&s;ily be compa&s;&s;ed by a prudent government. From this di|gre&s;&s;ion, which I thought material, I now return to the attorney general of Rouen.</P>
<P>His account of the finances of France is extremely curious. He &s;ays that, after the death of Francis I. Catharine of Medicis, who loved pomp and luxury, &s;ent for Italians to admini&s;ter the king's revenues, and that the &s;cience of finance and rai&s;ing money by loans was taught by tho&s;e people. They were ba|ni&s;hed by <HI>Sully,</HI> recalled by <HI>Mary of Medicis,</HI> &s;et a&s;ide by <HI>Richelieu,</HI> and after his death appeared upon the &s;tage again. The parallels drawn by the author between different periods preceding the reign of the financiers, and particularly &s;ome hi&s;torical re|marks upon the time of Francis I. are plau&s;ible and &s;educing. He attributes every thing to a &s;ingle cau&s;e, as <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> ex|plains all difficulties with the help of &s;ubtle matter. Yet he conde&s;cends to admit that Francis I. had not quite &s;uch nume|rous armies as are maintained at pre&s;ent. Is it not ridiculous and extravagant to compare the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate and the lu&s;tre of the crown, in the reign of that monarch, with the pre&s;ent condition of the kingdom? <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">During the reign of Lewis XIV. the &s;plendor, which &s;urrounded the throne and per&s;on of the monarch, &s;upported the pride and courage of the people for a long time after the real foundation of national pride and courage was removed. The French &s;oldier, who had never &s;een a Louis d'or, felt a noble compen&s;ation for his poverty, in the &s;pirit of &s;aying, <HI>I have the honor to be a Frenchman.</HI> Since that time, the &s;tate of France has &s;uffered a woeful reduction. The pride of na|tional &s;uperiority is gone, and the French monarch does not know what he has lo&s;t. No man now &s;ays, <HI>I have the honor to be a Frenchman.</HI> The character of the people is altered, not &s;o much by private di&s;tre&s;s, though univer&s;al, as by the mortifying &s;en&s;e of national degradation. The French are actually the grave&s;t people in Europe; and, what is not always applicable to their deportment, they have good rea&s;on for being &s;o. Yet their ingenuity finds a &s;alvo for their vanity. When di&s;tre&s;s has driven a Frenchman to lay down his coach, and walk the &s;treets in a frock, he calls it a philo&s;ophical imitation of Engli&s;h &s;implicity; and, when you &s;ee de&s;pair painted in his countenance, he tells you, with a politene&s;s very expre&s;&s;ive of conde&s;cen&s;ion, that Engli&s;h gravity is becoming, and that a wi&s;e man may profit by the example of his inferiors. But this is a wretched farce, which no degree of vanity can long &s;upport. He &s;inks under his &s;ituation, and in every in&s;tance yields the precedence to the Engli&s;h.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></NOTE></P>

Nothing can be more judicious, nor profound, than his remarks upon the exportation of corn. He proves that, the more corn is carried out of France, the le&s;s rea&s;on there will ever be to apprehend any extreme &s;carcity; and that the very low price of corn is a &s;ign of indige&s;tion in the &s;tate, ari|&s;ing from too great an abundance, and prejudicial to every rank of life. It is a worm that gnaws, and gradually under|mines the &s;tate. What he &s;ays on this article is deep in it&s;elf, and has been confirmed by the experience of France and England. The &s;ubject now engages the whole attention of the French mini&s;try, and I believe would have done &s;o long ago, if truth had been repre&s;ented with le&s;s heat, and not pu&s;hed to an ab&s;urdity; as, for in&s;tance, where he &s;ays that abu&s;es in the&s;e branches, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, occa&s;ioned a real lo&s;s to the kingdom of five hundred millions, and that the lo&s;s now is treble what it was at fir&s;t. Exaggerations of this nature have &s;poiled a picture in it&s;elf true and affecting. The &s;ame defect prevails through all the writings that have been copied

upon this work. An empirical way of repre&s;enting the di&s;order has probably retarded the application of a remedy. They a&s;&s;ign only one cau&s;e for an evil, that &s;prings from a complication of di&s;orders. The chief of the&s;e are frequent wars, and the new method of conducting them. By this kind of empirici&s;m, in|&s;tead of healing the wound, they only encourage the patient to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the &s;ame dangers; they inflame the di&s;order, and make the cure of it impo&s;&s;ible. The true cure con&s;i&s;ts in a regimen, without which no other remedy can operate; and that regimen is peace.</P>
<P>Violent exaggerations being always contradicted by experience, even truth it&s;elf at la&s;t is &s;u&s;pected, and pa&s;&s;es for &s;peculation. If a Spani&s;h or Portugue&s;e Jew, &s;ettled at Con&s;tantinople or Am&s;terdam, &s;hould affirm, that the unju&s;t expul&s;ion of the people of his religion out of Spain had done great mi&s;chief to that kingdom as well as to Portugal, he certainly would have rea&s;on on his &s;ide. The Jews in Spain and Portugal were a very innocent &s;et of people, quiet &s;ubjects, and u&s;eful citizens to the &s;tate. They were very numerous, and kept indu&s;try and com|merce alive. Many of them were men of learning, and much re&s;pected. They had even been admitted to a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration. Alphon&s;us the Fifth of Portugal tru&s;ted Abar|banel with the mo&s;t important employment, and was &s;erved by him with zeal, honor, and ability. Our Jew might add, with &s;trict truth, that the expul&s;ion of the&s;e people contributed to depopulate Spain and Portugal. He might even ob&s;erve, that particular cities were ruined by it. All this is very po&s;&s;ible; but if his enthu&s;ia&s;m carried him &s;o far beyond the line of truth as to affirm, that the violence offered to the Jews was the &s;ingle and only cau&s;e of the depopulation of Spain, the a&s;&s;ertion would be too ab&s;urd to be &s;upported. This is exactly the way of rea|&s;oning
<PB N="168" REF="188">
of the attorney-general of Rouen. He judged of the whole kingdom of France from what he &s;aw in a particular pro|vince, where the effect of fi&s;cal abu&s;es might perhaps have been more &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erved. His enthu&s;ia&s;m has carried him as far beyond the truth as our hone&s;t I&s;raelite's rea&s;oning about Spain. The prodigious deva&s;tation of that kingdom ari&s;es from the bani&s;hment of the Jews, the di&s;covery of America, the expul|&s;ion of the Moors, the multitude of religious orders, and the frequent wars carried on by Charles V. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. To reduce all the&s;e cau&s;es to one, is fal&s;e and ridiculous. A refugee might truly affirm, that the ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew, and the revocation of the edict of Nantes, have been very prejudicial to population, commerce, and indu&s;try, in France. The fact is unque&s;tionable; but it would be equally fal&s;e and ridiculous to pretend, that the&s;e events alone occa&s;ioned the decline of the kingdom. The vexations heaped upon the farmer may have contributed to it in &s;ome mea&s;ure, though not &s;o much as the revocation of the edict of Nantes, nor any thing like &s;o much as the author pretends. Exce&s;&s;ive luxury does its part, and mona&s;tic orders contribute not a little. But it is the continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bloody wars that has been the immediate, efficient cau&s;e of the depopulation of France. Spain, from a number of peculiar circum&s;tances, is &s;till more depopulated. A variety of cau&s;es may concur in producing the &s;ame effect. A man, who ob&s;erves only one of them, is dazzled by the &s;ingle object before him. With one general &s;olution he accounts for every appear|ance, and leads him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd con|clu&s;ions.</P>
<P>A judicious reader, who corrects the errors of exaggeration, will find in this work a number of curious, u&s;eful, and &s;olid ob&s;ervations. It is a pity that an author, who &s;ets out with true
<PB N="169" REF="189">
principles, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas, &s;hould be led a&s;tray by enthu&s;ia&s;m. I am inclined to think, that &s;ucceeding writers upon the &s;ame &s;ubject have &s;aid nothing material, that may not be found in his treati&s;e. It is true, that, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of exactly the &s;ame que&s;tions, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that the ideas of different authors &s;hould not &s;ometimes concur. Of all the writings I have &s;een, no one comes &s;o near as this to my own ideas of circulation. In truth, he is the only author who &s;eems to me to have had a clear conception of the &s;ubject. All the other writers, I have &s;een, wander from the mark. Yet it is po&s;&s;ible there may be many excellent performances, which have not come to my knowledge. I have always confined my&s;elf to an attentive ob&s;ervation of facts, and to my own meditations. After I had committed my fir&s;t ideas to writing, I looked for farther in&s;truction from books. My labors, I hope, will not be wholly unprofitable. The welfare of mankind is my object. I have no view to intere&s;t or reputation. My career is almo&s;t ended, and the world has lo&s;t its charms. All I wi&s;h, is to leave it with tranquillity. But to return to my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t exact ju&s;tice in the di&s;tribution of taxes in the interior of the kingdom, and the care to be taken not to e&s;tabli&s;h expen&s;ive offices of collection for the &s;ake of a trifling revenue, are objects of &s;uch importance, that I per&s;uade my&s;elf &s;ome remedy mu&s;t have been thought of in all the time &s;ince abu&s;es in the&s;e matters have been complained of. We have &s;een a wretch, who had nothing but his hands to &s;upport him&s;elf and his family, reduced to &s;uch mi&s;ery as to be obliged to &s;ell even the tools with which he earned his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The author of the <HI>Detail of France</HI> affirms, that it was matter of public noto|riety, that the&s;e abu&s;es occa&s;ioned the annual lo&s;s of three hun|dred thou&s;and &s;ouls, that peri&s;hed in mi&s;ery, particularly infants;
<PB N="170" REF="190">
that there was not &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for half the children of the poor at that age. The mother extenuated with labor and want of nouri&s;hment, the infant peri&s;hing at the brea&s;t for want of milk, and even tho&s;e of a more advanced age, having nothing to live on but bread and water, without bedding, clothes, or medicine in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s, were all involved in the &s;ame wretchedne&s;s, and &s;unk under it. If, in&s;tead of three hundred thou&s;and, only twenty thou&s;and &s;ouls were annually lo&s;t, what glory would it be to a &s;overeign, what plea&s;ure, what happine&s;s, to be able to relieve &s;o many complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es!&mdash;To be the father, the tutelar god of the unfortunate, and to re&s;tore them to happine&s;s; this is the only real charm that can alleviate the burthen of a crown. I &s;hould think as I do, if all the expence were to be lo&s;t to the &s;overeign, without any return to his revenue, but the happine&s;s of his people; how much more &s;o, when his own intere&s;t equally invites him to it! The &s;ame operation, that relieved the &s;ubject, would give wealth and power to the crown.</P>
<P>The author, &s;en&s;ible of the effect of circulation, judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves that a crown, taken from a man of fortune, is never (he &s;hould have &s;aid <HI>&s;eldom)</HI> any more than a crown, as well with re&s;pect to the individual, as to the body of the &s;tate; whereas, if taken from the indigent laborer, or little trade&s;man, it anni|hilates at one &s;troke a con&s;umption equal to a hundred crowns in the cour&s;e of a year. Among that cla&s;s of people, every thing perhaps turns upon the &s;ingle crown. This little &s;um, con&s;tantly reviving from one hand to another, con&s;titutes all their circula|tion. If all his calculations were as exact as this, he would not have computed the annual lo&s;s of the &s;tate at fifteen hundred millions. Notwith&s;tanding all the corrections added to it, the &s;um is too extravagant. If the tenth part of the money, &s;pent
<PB N="171" REF="191">
by &s;overeign princes in de&s;troying mankind, (out of which a hundred, or two hundred individuals, may perhaps make their fortunes) were applied, for ten years together, in pro|moting the happine&s;s of their own &s;ubjects, and of foreign &s;ettlers, who might be willing to employ their &s;trength and indu&s;try in the improvement of the &s;oil, population would &s;en&s;ibly recover, the earth would be cultivated, and manufactures encouraged. The king's revenue, even with a diminution of taxes, could not fail of improving con&s;iderably from the pro|digious increa&s;e of con&s;umption, and the quickening of circu|lation through every order of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>As long as the &s;tate of Europe bears any re&s;emblance to its fabulous origin, depopulation will continue to be felt. In vain may Cadmus &s;ow the dragon's teeth, if the children of the earth are to ri&s;e in arms, and employ them in de&s;troying one another. Princes, as well as individuals, look for happine&s;s and advancement at a di&s;tance, when perhaps they might find both one and the other at home. Real power is only to be acquired by living in peace with our neighbours, and pre&s;erving order and tranquillity among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>A new work has lately appeared, called the <HI>Rural Philo&s;opher,</HI> in which there are &s;ome very fine ob&s;ervations, though clouded by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of agriculture. The author's whole argument turns upon the &s;ame fal&s;e principle, which I have already refuted in the other Treati&s;e. Every thing is confined to the territorial produce. This is his motto, and the burthen of his &s;ong. In his opinion all the re&s;t is fallacy and ruin. Annuitants are nothing but devouring wolves. He does them the honor of placing them in the rank of beggars. Manufactures are per|nicious. Money is a chimera. In &s;hort, it is a mere enthu|&s;ia&s;m, borrowing enchanting colors from calculation. The&s;e ar|bitrary calculations, on &s;ubjects no way &s;u&s;ceptible of them,
<PB N="172" REF="192">
are enough to make rea&s;on it&s;elf run mad. When Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, for in&s;tance, in &s;upporting his &s;y&s;tem, finds him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed by facts, and by the experience of &s;uch a nation as Holland, he tells us that that country, <HI>which &s;ome people call a nation,</HI> is only an open factory, where money tran&s;actions are carried on upon momentary credit. This is a &s;trange way of treating a people, who formerly defended their liberty again&s;t the fir&s;t power in Europe; who were powerful enough to conquer almo&s;t all the Spani&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies as well as the Brazils, and upon who&s;e re&s;olutions the fate of Europe has frequently depended. Without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of loans and fictitious riches, neither England nor the republic could have carried on &s;o exten&s;ive a commerce as they have done, nor &s;upported &s;uch enormous expences abroad. Facts and expe|perience are for ever at variance with Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau's general rules. In this new treati&s;e he affirms that, if the national debt were carried to &s;uch an extreme, that the &s;tate of the annuitant &s;hould be cho&s;en in preference to any other, we might then bid adieu to all expence; annuities, commerce, lands, every thing would be alienated, every thing would be overthrown, and fall to ruin. Yet it is to be ob&s;erved, that land in England is better cultivated, and has ri&s;en con&s;iderably in value, &s;ince the national debt has increa&s;ed the number of annuitants, or rather of tho&s;e who have part of their property in annuities, and who for the mo&s;t part are either men of rank who improve their e&s;tates, or capital merchants, or wealthy trade&s;men. The author pretends to prove, upon evidence of fact, that annuities are to the profit of him who receives them, and to the detriment of him who pays them.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What creditable family is there that does not con&s;ider it as the fir&s;t object, in matter of bu&s;ine&s;s, to pay off every mortgage
<PB N="173" REF="193">
that incumbers their e&s;tate? Is there a father of a family, who wi&s;hes for an independent fortune with re&s;pect to his expences, and for an idle life with re&s;pect to the place of his re&s;idence; and do we not hear him affirm, ever &s;ince this unhappy cu&s;tom has prevailed, that, to be at his ea&s;e, he mu&s;t have at lea&s;t a third of his property placed out at intere&s;t? The proof then is, that every man thinks it his intere&s;t to lend, but no man to borrow; that annuities are to the profit of him who receives, and to the prejudice of him who pays; and that money lent at intere&s;t is ruinous to the borrower. Whatever is incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of a &s;ingle family, mu&s;t be equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the intere&s;t of all the families in a &s;tate. The &s;tate it&s;elf is only one great family, formed by the union of &s;everal. The &s;eparate ruin of each is the aggregate ruin of the nation. The univer&s;e is one immen&s;e &s;tate, compo&s;ed of great families under the title of nations. The &s;ame cau&s;es, that de&s;troy a nation, operate equally to the ruin of the world, and of mankind."</Q></P>
<P>This is an admirable &s;ermon, but unluckily it mi&s;&s;es the mark. The principle is not univer&s;ally true, and the application is defective. Money lent at intere&s;t, &s;o far from injuring the borrower, is of &s;ervice to the merchant, and promotes trade. In Holland, England, and all commercial countries, many of the wealthie&s;t merchants borrow money at three or four per cent. and by employing it in trade make double and triple the profit by it. This advantage, which merchants fir&s;t met with in Hol|land, has contributed not a little to facilitate commerce, and to the glory and welfare of the &s;tate. Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau has no true idea of the&s;e matters. The liberty of drawing upon a corre&s;pondent, the intere&s;t paid him for the money he advances, are &s;o many loans in effect, infinitely to the advantage of the
<PB N="174" REF="194">
borrower. When the father of a family ve&s;ts <HI>all</HI> his property in annuities, (which &s;eldom happens) he then, and only then, may be &s;aid to give up all thoughts of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to aim at nothing but an independent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In that ca&s;e it may be his intere&s;t to pay off every debt that incumbers his family. We &s;ee then how much the principle mu&s;t be qualified, to make it true with re&s;pect to individuals. The application of it to the &s;tate is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. That which ruins an individual, does not always ruin the &s;tate. The money a man lays out for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, or in articles of luxury, does not return again into his family; whereas the internal expences of a monarch, or of the &s;tate, return into the nation, encourage and improve it. The nation in a body pays the&s;e expences, or rather lends the money for its own advantage. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of loans a war may be &s;upported by moderate taxes, in compari&s;on with what the nation would otherwi&s;e be obliged to pay, at the &s;ame time that the numerary wealth and circulation increa&s;e with the debt, as we have already demon&s;trated. If other ob&s;tacles did not lie in the way, we &s;hould find that both population and agriculture would be promoted by that quick and ea&s;y motion which loans impre&s;s upon the &s;prings of a prudent admini&s;tration. Loans judiciou&s;ly made, and wi&s;ely applied, under favor of peace, con&s;titute the only means of recovering population, and improving the &s;oil.</P>
<P>It is not true that, in the revealed law, God forbids all intere&s;t on money borrowed, as u&s;urious. That pa&s;&s;age in the Holy Scriptures has never been under&s;tood, and has given occa&s;ion to many atrocious calumnies again&s;t the Jews, which, in&s;tead of affecting that people, are &s;o many bla&s;phemies again&s;t the word of God. In the Hebrew language there are two expre&s;&s;ions; <HI>ne&s;&s;eg,</HI> which &s;ignifies Intere&s;t; and <HI>tarbit,</HI> which &s;ignifies U&s;ury.
<PB N="175" REF="195">
How often has Voltaire affirmed, that, in the maledictions pronounced by Mo&s;es again&s;t the Jews, he threatens them, that they &s;hall borrow on u&s;ury, and not be able to lend on the &s;ame terms? The charge is fal&s;e and &s;candalous. In the chap|ter of Benedictions, the text &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt lend to divers nations, and thou &s;halt not borrow.</HI> In the chapter of Cur&s;es, the text &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt borrow of divers nations, and thou &s;halt not lend;</HI> without one word of u&s;ury or intere&s;t. I could not avoid taking notice of &s;o gro&s;s a mi&s;take. It is true, however, that among the Jews the rich are forbidden from taking intere&s;t of the poor; but Mo&s;es does not extend the prohibition to people of fortune among one another. The Jewi&s;h government was theocratical, depending merely on the cultivation of the &s;oil, which was di&s;tributed among the people with an exact equality. The legi&s;lature appointed a jubilee for the abolition of debts, and for the re&s;toration of every family to the lands they had alienated; but in&s;olvent debtors paid for this advantage with the lo&s;s of their liberty, until the period of re&s;titution arrived. Their political con&s;titution is no way applicable to Europe. In the &s;ame &s;pirit Mo&s;es permits the Jews to take intere&s;t of &s;trangers; but it is ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that u&s;ury was ever com|manded. <HI>Lanochry ta&s;&s;ig. Ta&s;&s;ig</HI> comes from <HI>ne&s;&s;ig,</HI> and can only &s;ignify Legal Intere&s;t, which they were permitted to take from &s;trangers. <HI>Tarbit</HI> &s;ignifies Augmentation, or U&s;ury, which God never commanded his people to exact. A reproach of this kind is bla&s;phemy in the mouth of a Chri&s;tian, and folly in the mind of a philo&s;opher. But to return.</P>
<P>An equal di&s;tribution of property was much in the &s;pirit of the Greek and Roman legi&s;lation. We know what agitation was produced by the agrarian law among the Romans. In our con&s;titutions this chimerical &s;y&s;tem is given up. The number
<PB N="176" REF="196">
of new cla&s;&s;es created by indu&s;try, commerce, and abundance, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of di&s;tribution unknown to the ancients. Through the medium of national loans, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this new property become co-u&s;ufructuaries of the &s;oil, with &s;ignal advantage to the &s;tate. From the whole of this treati&s;e it appears that they multiply the numerary, quicken circulation, and encourage commerce, manufactures, agriculture, revenue, and population.</P>
<P>Gold and &s;ilver are u&s;ele&s;s in a de&s;ert; whereas the&s;e metals, or whatever repre&s;ents them, in a populous country &s;urrounded by poli&s;hed nations, &s;upply every want, and quicken every re&s;ource, by means of a general convention. The wi&s;e man had rea&s;on to &s;ay, "Money an&s;wers to every thing." To deny the&s;e propo&s;itions, is an abu&s;e of truth, and of the under&s;tanding, and confounds the &s;imple&s;t ideas. All men cannot be proprie|tors of land. To pro&s;cribe the other cla&s;&s;es is an in&s;upportable ab&s;urdity. The anathema, pronounced again&s;t them by the <HI>Rural Philo&s;opher,</HI> is equally unju&s;t and ridiculous. The num|ber of mere annuitants is very incon&s;iderable. Their pretended idlene&s;s is not &s;upported by the labor of others. They, on the contrary, &s;upport that labor by their expence. But the&s;e idle annuitants, who have neither land, nor office, nor employment civil or military, are very rare. Intere&s;t on money is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary. U&s;ury is dangerous and de&s;tructive. To confound the two objects, is to forbid the u&s;e of fire, becau&s;e it burns tho&s;e who go too clo&s;e to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rural Philo&s;opher</HI> is very &s;evere upon manufactures. It is true the manufacturer, the arti&s;t, the merchant, and the banker, can more ea&s;ily remove into another country. Their property is not &s;o intimately attached to the &s;tate, or rather to the &s;oil. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Their wealth," &s;ays he, is di&s;per&s;ed and unknown.
<PB N="177" REF="197">
And all riches that depend upon &s;eculation, or are capable of being hoarded, give no hold to the &s;overeign power."</Q> This rule however is not univer&s;ally true. It can only hold with re&s;pect to individuals, not to the whole cla&s;s. For example, half a dozen manufacturers of Lyons, a few merchants belonging to Mar&s;eilles, or St. Maloe's, and a banker of Paris, may quit their country without difficulty in the cour&s;e of a day, and e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves el&s;ewhere. In the &s;ame manner a landlord may &s;ell his e&s;tate, and purcha&s;e land in another country; but it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that all the manufacturers of Lyons, that all the merchants of Mar&s;eilles or Bourdeaux, or that all the bankers of Paris, can find occupation el&s;ewhere for their trade, indu&s;try, and abilities.</P>
<P>The landlord would be the fir&s;t to &s;uffer, if the merchant, the mechanic, the annuitant, the nobility, and even the arti&s;t of luxury, did not give a venal value to the &s;uperfluous produce of the earth, by quickening circulation and con|&s;umption. To decide this que&s;tion, or to &s;tate it in rational terms, I &s;hould be glad that the&s;e profound, eternal calculators, who pretend to under&s;tand the art of agriculture &s;o thoroughly, would make a &s;imple, exact, and unexaggerated calculation of the number of people nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate and improve all the &s;oil of France; that is, as much of it as is &s;uited to the pro|duction of corn, or fit to be laid out in vineyards. The woods are nece&s;&s;ary for various u&s;es, and occupy but a few hands. The improvement of the heaths at Bourdeaux is not to be reckoned, while &s;uch quantities of good land remain uncultivated. It will not ea&s;ily be believed how few hands are nece&s;&s;ary to make a rich &s;oil produce &s;ufficient nouri&s;hment for a great number of con&s;umers. The earth is &s;o fertile, and nature is &s;o bountiful,
<PB N="178" REF="198">
that multitudes may &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the labor of a few. Nothing but commerce, mutual intercour&s;e, and free exportation, can give a venal value to all the &s;uperfluous produce. Every re&s;traint upon the vent of it is injurious to the body of the &s;tate, and checks population in other branches. As the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, &s;o &s;everely pro&s;cribed by Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, multiply in the &s;tate, internal con&s;umption will increa&s;e, and foreign trade and exportation become &s;o much the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. As manu|factures flouri&s;h, the freedom of commerce will improve. An|nuitants, bankers, merchants, and other citizens, will circulate &s;o much the more money, and employ &s;o many more hands in mercantile occupations, which we are told are &s;o unfruitful a &s;oil. Population will improve, and agriculture be much more encouraged, by the con&s;umption of the manufacturer, than population can be encouraged by agriculture. But to return to the calculation. It will be found that, if wars, colonies, and &s;ome particular moral cau&s;es had not depopulated Europe, the lands in general would have been better cultivated, and their value improved; and that this con&s;umption and value would proceed from the multitude of u&s;eful and indu&s;trious citizens, who&s;e expence and circulation &s;et every thing in motion. Eng|land in proportion is much better peopled than France, and the &s;oil more improved. Yet their exportation of corn is im|men&s;e. The <HI>internal</HI> con&s;umption and population of the kingdom might therefore be much greater than they are. But this popu|lation, which of cour&s;e would increa&s;e the cla&s;s of farmers, could not exi&s;t without a proportionate increa&s;e in all tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, again&s;t which the enthu&s;ia&s;tic apo&s;tles of agriculture have pronounced their anathema. I &s;hould willingly concur with them in opinion, if they were contented with extolling the
<PB N="179" REF="199">
immen&s;e utility of their favorite object, without excluding others equally u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary to the improvement of agri|culture it&s;elf. An able calculator might demon&s;trate that, if other nations did not cavil with the Dutch about tho&s;e branches of indu&s;try which have fallen to their lot, and which in truth are their only inheritance, Am&s;terdam, Middleburgh, Dort, and Rotterdam, might contain double their pre&s;ent number of inhabitants, with a con&s;iderable addition to the general opulence of the republic. Population, which in Holland is much greater in proportion than in any part of Europe, would continue to increa&s;e, with prodigious advantage to tho&s;e nations that culti|vate their &s;oil. This &s;ingle reflection qualifies all exaggerations, and reduces the que&s;tion to tho&s;e terms of policy and rea&s;on, which I am endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>Let us not deceive our&s;elves. The harmony of a &s;tate ari&s;es from the agreement of its various parts. They borrow a mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance from each other. Time, that con&s;umes every thing, will correct a number of mi&s;takes. The new world, which now in the philo&s;opher's eye &s;eems u&s;ele&s;s, hurtful, and even dangerous to the old one, &s;hall one day or other become nece&s;&s;ary, when the population of Europe &s;hall be carried to its highe&s;t point of improvement. We know that in China the legi&s;lature are obliged to check population; the example of China and Holland proves the truth of what I advance. If all the arable land in Europe were laid out in the production of corn, a great part of it, I am convinced, would peri&s;h for want of con&s;umers. To create a con&s;umption equal to &s;o exten&s;ive a cultivation, we mu&s;t multiply the population of great cities, towns and villages. There neither &s;hould, nor can be, more than one Paris in France, nor one London in England; but there might be, as in China,
<PB N="180" REF="200">
fifty cities more populous than Lyons, Nantes, Rochelle, and Bourdeaux; and every village might be better inhabited than it is. This is the way to rai&s;e the power of the prince, and the value of land; which never can be accompli&s;hed but by a con|tinued peace, and by removing tho&s;e moral ob&s;tacles that make it difficult for the farmer to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and counteract population. A free exportation of the produce of the earth is e&s;&s;ential. The re&s;t is the work of time, and of a good admini&s;tration, under which, commerce, manufactures, circulation, and public credit act their re&s;pective parts, and all concur in promoting the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But every branch has its limits and relative proportion to the re&s;t. While they pre&s;erve this proportion, they a&s;&s;i&s;t, when they depart from it, they de&s;troy one another.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of cities, &s;ays Mon&s;ieur de Monte&s;quieu, judge of the opulence of a kingdom by the glittering luxury of tho&s;e who are the ruin of it. They deceive them&s;elves un|doubtedly. At the &s;ame time we are not to judge of the &s;tate of a whole kingdom from the decay of a &s;ingle province. The metropolis, we are told, with all its barren opulence, is only a magazine, like ancient Rome, in which the &s;poils of the pro|vinces are collected; but the difference is very material. Paris and London are inhabited by indu&s;trious cla&s;&s;es of men, who promote agriculture, commerce, and con&s;umption. The extent of the two cities exceeds their due proportion to the &s;tate, which is depopulated by other cau&s;es. For this rea&s;on, Paris appears, in the philo&s;opher's eye, a ma&s;s of &s;everal cities tran&s;planted, and which might be more advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated el&s;ewhere. This tran&s;plantation, &s;ays Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, can only have been effected by a &s;ort of chymical extraction, con&s;idering the lo&s;s of all the alimentary juices imbibed by the channels through
<PB N="181" REF="201">
which they pa&s;s, before they reach the capital. The &s;urplus, received by the metropolis, may perhaps be ill di&s;tributed, vari~able, precarious, and tran&s;itory, owing to a concurrence of various effects, which prevent the proportionate population of the kingdom, and the cultivation of the &s;oil. But I affirm that France might be more populous, the land better cultivated, and Paris as great, and even better inhabited, than it actually is; and that, if a due harmony and proportion were pre&s;erved in the other parts, the greatne&s;s of the capital, and multitude of its citizens, would be an encouragement to agriculture, which mu&s;t &s;tand &s;till, if it were not for the number of con&s;umers in the different cla&s;&s;es of citizens. Such, in &s;hort, is my opinion upon this important que&s;tion.</P>
<P>A number of examples might be quoted, but they would lead me into a detail of the proportions and balance to be pre&s;erved in every cla&s;s. When one cla&s;s invades another, the prejudice they &s;uffer is reciprocal. The fir&s;t advantage may &s;eem &s;pecious, but the lo&s;s of harmony and proportion makes it tran&s;itory and de&s;tructive. The many pa&s;&s;ages in hi&s;tory, which &s;how the political inconvenience of too copious a population, would lead us too far. The eternal laws of providence have implanted the &s;eed of generation and perpetuity in every &s;ub&s;tance, but they &s;eem al&s;o to have &s;et bounds to their multiplication. The works of nature &s;ub&s;i&s;t by devouring one another. Every thing in its turn is pa&s;ture and a grave. Final cau&s;es are placed beyond our reach. The quantity of acorns lo&s;t or con&s;umed is prodigious. Very few produce oaks. Every thing has its u&s;e. Out of a thou&s;and melon-&s;eeds &s;carce one perpetuates the plant. The attraction, which the Author of nature has annexed to the act that perpetuates our being, is oftener a dream of plea&s;ure, than
<PB N="182" REF="202">
an effort to immortali&s;e the &s;pecies. If nature, in &s;ome in&s;tances, appears too prodigal, it is becau&s;e we are unacquainted with the immutable laws by which her oeconomy is directed. America perhaps, after depopulating Europe, may &s;erve hereafter to relieve us from too abundant a population.</P>
<P>To make it apparent that there is a maximum in agriculture and population, the reader is reque&s;ted to employ his imagination upon the following remarks. Suppo&s;e, in the fir&s;t place, that all Europe were as well peopled as it might be. By computation it would contain four or five times as many inhabitants, as it has at pre&s;ent. In that ca&s;e, it would be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate every foot of land, in order to maintain &s;uch a multi|tude of people; and let it be admitted that, by a &s;uperior &s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lation and government, the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es &s;hould be di&s;tributed in due gradations; and, in a word, that an exact proportion and harmony &s;hould be pre&s;erved among all the parts of &s;o many different &s;tates. When Europe had once arrived at this period of agriculture and population, what would be the con&s;equence? Mu&s;t the farther progre&s;s of population be &s;topt? By what means could it be done? We &s;hould be compelled to &s;end colonies to America and el&s;ewhere. Even this re&s;ource would not be &s;ufficient. The fatal a&s;&s;i&s;tance of war would be called in, to &s;upply the office of pe&s;tilence and famine. They too in their turn would &s;oon be &s;everely felt. The very population we &s;uppo&s;e would introduce them. The annual produce of the earth would be annually con&s;umed by the re&s;pective inhabitants of every country. Now it is certain that, after a few years, the harve&s;t fails in all countries. All of them then mu&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively peri&s;h by famine; becau&s;e every country would want the whole of its own produce for the internal con|&s;umption
<PB N="183" REF="203">
of its inhabitants, and could &s;pare nothing for the &s;upply of its neighbours.</P>
<P>Some naturali&s;ts pretend, that our terre&s;trial globe is only &s;ur|rounded by a vegetative cru&s;t, gradually exhau&s;ted by cultivation, until at la&s;t it becomes dry and unfruitful. They tell us that the de&s;erts of Arabia were once a fertile country, and the earlie&s;t habitation of mankind. Without &s;ifting the que&s;tion too mi|nutely, we all know that the earth recovers its youth, and pre&s;erves its fertility, by repo&s;e. We know with what eager impatient vegetation a new &s;oil rewards the fir&s;t labors of the plough. To promote the order, harmony, and pre&s;ervation of the whole, there mu&s;t be an alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cultivation and repo&s;e; a &s;tore of provi&s;ions mu&s;t be re&s;erved; &s;ome lands mu&s;t be fallow; &s;ome countries mu&s;t be uninhabited; it pro|bably does not enter into the de&s;ign of Providence, that the earth &s;hould be equally peopled and cultivated all over. Such a &s;tate of perfection and opulence, if it could exi&s;t for a moment, would introduce the &s;evere&s;t calamities. We know not what our &s;upreme good con&s;i&s;ts in. Apparent imperfections contribute to the general &s;ecurity. We only &s;ee part of the picture, and are dazzled by fal&s;e lights. Perfection cannot belong to the &s;ingle part before us, but mu&s;t re&s;ult from the whole.</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive population has con&s;tantly given birth to war, which, turning again&s;t its parent, dimini&s;hes and de&s;troys it.</P>
<P>To multiply men, &s;ays Mon&s;ieur de Mirabeau, without mul|tiplying &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is devoting them to the mi&s;ery of famine. The phenomenon is rare, and can never happen, but through &s;ome defect in admini&s;tration and police. On the other hand, to multiply &s;ub&s;i&s;tence without multiplying con&s;umers, is a ruinous chimera, that never can hold above a year. The phy|&s;ical
<PB N="184" REF="204">
limits of population in any country are not inviolably confined by the produce of its own territory, when trade and navigation pro&s;per, and are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by credit, circulation, and fictitious wealth. Let Holland be the example. It is rather true that cultivation is inviolably confined by the internal con|&s;umption, or precarious foreign exportation. When population exceeds wealth, the defect is inherent in the body of the &s;tate. The whole political machine is out of order. Whenever this happens, every part will demand our attention at the &s;ame moment. The remedy mu&s;t be general, and equally applied to every defect. We mu&s;t then, as Lord Bacon ob&s;erves upon another &s;ubject, endeavour to imitate the great operations of nature, not tho&s;e of art, which are always &s;low, feeble, and imperfect. The &s;tatuary forms his &s;tatue &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by parts; &s;ometimes working upon the head, &s;ometimes upon the limbs; but it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to follow the conduct of nature in what|ever &s;he produces; <HI>rudimenta partium omnium &s;imul parit et pro|ducit.</HI> She at once lays the plan of the whole being, and furni&s;hes all the parts together. Vegetables and animals increa&s;e in &s;ize, and improve in their &s;trength; but they are the &s;ame from the moment they begin to exi&s;t. There mu&s;t be one coercive power to confine the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate, as the key-&s;tone of the arch holds the building together. In a great kingdom, to pre&s;erve the harmony of the &s;tate, the good order and pro&s;perity of the nation, agriculture, commerce, manufac|tures, circulation, public credit, internal police, finance, mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment, colonies, navigation, marine, and moderate luxury, &s;hould proceed together in a reciprocal proportion.</P>
<P>Extent of frontier alone does not con&s;titute the power of a &s;tate; but it is a con&s;iderable advantage, as it offers a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="185" REF="205">
to a greater number of &s;ubjects. Yet number alone, with a mere phy&s;ical &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, is not enough. They mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t with ea&s;e; and, to make a great number &s;ub&s;i&s;t with ea&s;e, they mu&s;t be divided into cla&s;&s;es. To confine them to the &s;ingle occupation of agriculture, is impo&s;&s;ible. If the population of France were complete, the external vent or exportation of corn would be of little or no u&s;e. As things are circum&s;tanced, ex|portation mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a &s;upplementary con&s;umption, in favor of agriculture, or as a remedy for the want of population. This vehicle of commerce &s;upports agriculture, and increa&s;es the number of &s;ubjects. But the increa&s;e of population is not the true &s;ecret of government; it con&s;i&s;ts in maintaining the harmony of parts, and the equilibrium of the whole.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER UPON THE JEALOUSY OF COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;t upon it, that I &s;hall treat, &s;eriou&s;ly and in writing, the propo&s;ition which I advanced the other day at your hou&s;e. Permit me then to remind you of the cor|rective I added to it. I &s;aid, that the proof required a head better furni&s;hed than mine. The lights I po&s;&s;e&s;s are not &s;uffi|ciently exten&s;ive; my knowledge is too &s;uperficial to demon&s;trate &s;o complicated a truth, which yet I feel my&s;elf, though unable to make it evident to others. Such is this propo&s;ition. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of commercial powers, rivals and neigh|bours, would not cla&s;h, at lea&s;t in the degree that is believed, if private intere&s;ts did not frequently intervene."</Q></P>
<P>Private intere&s;t u&s;ually a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;que of public good. I believe it po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the &s;eparate intere&s;ts of every nation with the common and reciprocal advantage of them all. From that moment the &s;y&s;tem of the Abb&eacute; de St. Pierre would cea&s;e to be con&s;idered as the dream of an hone&s;t man. The happine&s;s of a &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts in the number of its &s;ubjects, the facility of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and in the power of the prince. This power is at its highe&s;t point, when it procures to its &s;ubjects every
<PB N="190" REF="208">
advantage that the territory will admit of, when every cla&s;s or gradation of inhabitants enjoys its re&s;pective condition, and all the cla&s;&s;es find them&s;elves ranged in a political proportion. If the nature of the &s;oil or climate refu&s;es any thing to convenience or opinion, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of commerce and indu&s;try to obtain a &s;upply of that deficiency from foreigners, to whom in return we &s;hould endeavour to di&s;po&s;e of our own &s;uperfluity, whether it be of that produce which the nature of the &s;oil furni&s;hes for the &s;upport of the inhabitants, or of the produce of their indu&s;try. This, I believe, is the cleare&s;t idea of the origin, utility, and nece&s;&s;ity of commerce.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t it was the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving from our neighbours whatever fell &s;hort at home in the &s;upply of our real wants; after|wards, in the &s;upply of our &s;en&s;uality; and la&s;tly, in that of our luxury. If on our &s;ide there be a &s;uperfluity which our neighbours want, we only make an exchange. But as the mea|&s;ure cannot at all times be equal, the &s;urplus con&s;titutes the balance of trade, which the more indigent of the two parties, on clo&s;ing their account, pays in money to the other, which, at that moment, happens to be the richer. Since wants are reci|procal, and &s;ince the winning parties can have no profit but at the expence of &s;ome one who pays the &s;urplus, or balance, in money, it follows, that they cannot de&s;troy the lo&s;ing party without exhau&s;ting the &s;ource of their own happine&s;s. What would one &s;ay of a man who &s;hould cut the udder of a cow in order to draw more milk from it? All profe&s;&s;ions, in every country, labor for each other, and lend each other a mutual &s;up|port. When they &s;upply the wants of their neighbours, they are in fact &s;ecuring their own exi&s;tence. One profe&s;&s;ion de&s;troyed would alter the harmony of &s;ociety, or the well-being of almo&s;t all. No man buys a commodity, or any part of the produce of
<PB N="191" REF="209">
his neighbour's indu&s;try, but under a tacit condition, that the &s;eller &s;hall do as much by the buyer, either immediately him&s;elf, or by the interpo&s;ition of &s;everal hands who are concerned in the circulation; and money is the pledge for the performance of the condition. If the intere&s;t, or utility, be not in &s;ome &s;en&s;e reciprocal, the advantage is fallacious; like a meteor that di&s;ap|pears and alarms at the moment that it glitters. But the &s;ame thing, which happens among the different profe&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame country, would al&s;o happen among neighbouring commercial powers.</P>
<P>Commerce is a game, and with beggars it is impo&s;&s;ible to win. If we were to win con&s;tantly, in every article, and from every body we played with, we mu&s;t agree to return the chief part of our winnings, in order to begin the game again. Such a devouring commerce would de&s;troy it&s;elf. Our neighbours, reduced to mi&s;ery, would not have wherewithal to pay for our commodities, or our indu&s;try. This principle &s;hows that a univer&s;al commerce, and all exclu&s;ive or exce&s;&s;ive advantages, are as ab&s;urd as they are unju&s;t. If a political harmony con&s;i&s;ts in a proportionate though unequal di&s;tribution of various advantages, the greate&s;t advantage of each party would be to po&s;&s;e&s;s that which &s;uited it&s;elf the be&s;t, without injuring others; and I am per&s;uaded that &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;pecious advantages, which we mo&s;t affect, would, if taken out of the hands of a neighbour, whom we are jealous of without rea&s;on, be in effect prejudicial to us. It often happens that the profits, derived to us indirectly, are rea&s;onable enough, and perhaps greater, and le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ing, than if we had a direct po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is clear, that the pre&s;ervation and happine&s;s of the whole con&s;titute the pre&s;ervation and happine&s;s of every part. This principle is inconte&s;table. There is another equally true, that
<PB N="192" REF="210">
a particular commercial advantage, almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s to one nation, is nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of another. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Molucca I&s;lands would be as u&s;ele&s;s to Por|tugal, &s;ince her di&s;covery of the mines of Brazil, as it is nece&s;&s;ary to the republic of Holland. Portugal already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es too much metal. There would be a repletion of it, if the cultivation and other advantages of the kingdom were in a &s;tate of activity. Gold may be con&s;idered there as a merchandi&s;e, the exportation of which is u&s;eful; whereas Holland, de&s;titute of territorial wealth, and from the high price of labor incapable of a com|petition in manufactures, would &s;oon be undone, if it were not for &s;ome important article, that re&s;tores the equilibrium of money, and creates a balance in her favor, which all the other &s;tates profit by, as will appear hereafter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"From the&s;e two principles I would venture to draw a third, That it is frequently the intere&s;t of all the commercial powers, that &s;ome particular advantage &s;hould belong to &s;ome one particular power, in preference to any other; and that, far from being a ju&s;t cau&s;e of jealou&s;y to other powers, it is on the contrary their intere&s;t to pre&s;erve it."</Q> A fourth principle, which al&s;o to me appears evident, though it be little ob&s;erved, is, That we &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;s any branch of commerce in all its parts. We are compelled to have recour&s;e to our neighbours, and as it were to divide the cake. The party, that &s;eems to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, frequently has the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare. Another principle, of which I am per&s;uaded, is, That Europe being a family, or body compo&s;ed of various members, it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy one of them without damage to the re&s;t; and that Holland is the power, to which this principle mo&s;t manife&s;tly applies. In the &s;equel I hope to prove it clearly.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="211">
I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that I con&s;ider Europe as it is now con&s;tituted, and mankind according to their pre&s;ent manners, which I do not mean to critici&s;e. Otherwi&s;e it would be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a philo&s;ophical enquiry, whether commerce, the actual whim of the age, be e&s;&s;ential to human happine&s;s; to what degree luxury is u&s;eful, at what point it becomes mi&s;chievous, and how far it has been abu&s;ed. The pre&s;ent que&s;tion is only to catch the &s;pirit of the age we live in, and endeavour to com|bine, in the mo&s;t ju&s;t proportion po&s;&s;ible, the &s;everal branches of reciprocal wants between different nations, in order to pro|cure the importation of foreign productions, and the exportation of our own. It is certain that, if any &s;tate could &s;ucceed in obtaining, what all parties &s;eem to pur&s;ue, the means of &s;up|plying it&s;elf with a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence entirely national, it might from that moment exi&s;t as an in&s;ulated &s;tate. No longer making a part of the whole, commerce would be of no u&s;e to it. But &s;uch a &s;tate, though not repugnant to nature, from which we have too far departed, is incompatible with our manners. Hunt|ing, fi&s;hing, and agriculture, originally furni&s;hed the univer&s;al &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Factitious multiplied wants have given birth to commerce and manufactures, the children of indu&s;try and plea&s;ure. But we labor to no purpo&s;e. There is &s;uch a concatenation in the intere&s;ts of commerce, that no one party can carry it on alone. We mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have recour&s;e to our neighbours, who divide the profit with us.</P>
<P>Let us come to a particular example. England has lately made the acqui&s;ition of Canada. I believe it is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e that this part of the world is entirely lo&s;t to the com|merce of France. There are a number of things, without which, I conceive, the commerce of Canada mu&s;t decline, and which the Engli&s;h are obliged to receive from France. The wines for
<PB N="194" REF="212">
the u&s;e of the colony, and the brandies, of which the &s;avages, unfortunately for them, make &s;o great a con&s;umption, mu&s;t be furni&s;hed by France. I &s;hall here ob&s;erve, by the by, that however great the opulence of England, or of any other com|mercial power, may be, that part of it, which re&s;ults from commerce and credit, is always more precarious than that which ari&s;es from the nature of the &s;oil. It is more ca&s;ual, and depends upon a train of lucky accidents, which contrary acci|dents may de&s;troy.</P>
<P>The ba&s;e may lo&s;e its proportion to the re&s;t of the building. The kernel perhaps, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, might in time be in&s;ufficient to nouri&s;h the rind. In many ca&s;es we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to our neighbours, and &s;hare with them. The Engli&s;h can never make their &s;oil produce wine. To procure this plea&s;ure for them&s;elves, and to &s;upply their colonies, they will always enrich France.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h will probably never catch the ta&s;te of this nation for inventing fa&s;hions, nor overcome the inclination of others to adopt them. French manufactures will always be preferred, from caprice, fancy, fa&s;hion, and becau&s;e they are always the cheape&s;t. Labor in France is not &s;o dear as in England, and might be &s;till cheaper, if, by means of a continued peace, it were po&s;&s;ible to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the finances, to encourage popu|lation, and le&s;&s;en the weight of taxes. The immen&s;e tribute, which the re&s;t of Europe pay to France in return for trifles, will increa&s;e in proportion to the moderate price of manufac|tures. At pre&s;ent it is &s;ufficient to &s;how that France already derives a real profit from the Engli&s;h colonies in general, and even from tho&s;e which &s;eem to be entirely lo&s;t to her in point of commerce. The Engli&s;h will undoubtedly for the future import from France more wines, brandy, &s;alt, vinegar, oil of
<PB N="195" REF="213">
Provence, linens, thread, &s;ilks, ribbands, and even &s;ugar and indigo, than they did before; becau&s;e Canada cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the&s;e articles. Add to this the &s;aving of men, (far more valuable than any commodities) which it co&s;t France to &s;upport this colony, and it will appear that, although England may have gained greatly, France has not lo&s;t the whole.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Grenada, and the Grenadillas, mu&s;t in time make a rich return to England. But, be&s;ides the trea&s;ures which it co&s;t to conquer them during the war, the Engli&s;h have pur|cha&s;ed them a &s;econd time at the peace, having paid large &s;ums to France for the plantations and improvements already made there. The French inhabitants, on quitting the i&s;land, &s;old the &s;oil to the Engli&s;h for double what the &s;ame plantations were worth before the la&s;t war. This circum&s;tance &s;urely &s;hould cure us of the rage of conque&s;t. France had gained a real and &s;olid increa&s;e of its numerary wealth returned into the kingdom, while the profits of the Engli&s;h were yet in expectation. The&s;e i&s;lands at pre&s;ent make a great return to England. Let it be ob&s;erved that, when I &s;ay the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have co&s;t the Engli&s;h large &s;ums, it is becau&s;e I think that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions yielded to them by the peace &s;hould be con&s;idered as the only equivalent for the expences of the war, and for the lo&s;s of &s;o many men. On one &s;ide then we mu&s;t reckon Canada, Florida, the Grenadillas, and Senegal; on the other, the whole expence of the war, and lo&s;s of men; then make the computation. I que&s;tion whether the Engli&s;h government will, for a long time, receive an increa&s;e of revenue proportioned to the load of intere&s;t due on the new loans; or whether the nation in general will &s;oon receive a compen&s;ation more than &s;ufficient to balance the new burthen of taxes, and the intere&s;t paid to foreigners concerned in the public funds. In an ab&s;tract view, the kingdom mu&s;t be a lo&s;er,
<PB N="196" REF="214">
if a part, or rather the whole of its taxes, did not return again into the hands of the nation; and if its numerary wealth were not augmented by the increa&s;e of the national debt, as I have demon&s;trated el&s;ewhere. Without this compen&s;ation, and the &s;ecurity of their former &s;ettlements, the advantage of England in the la&s;t peace would have been very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>But without attempting a complete &s;olution of this problem, let us continue to enquire into the intere&s;ts of nations as they actually &s;tand. France <HI>undoubtedly</HI> draws a profit from the com|merce of Canada, and the other Engli&s;h colonies, owing to the connection of intere&s;ts in&s;eparable in a commercial &s;y&s;tem. The more the&s;e colonies flouri&s;h, the greater will be their demand for French commodities, now become nece&s;&s;ary to them. On the other hand, the more France &s;hall flouri&s;h, and the more plen|tiful her harve&s;ts are, at &s;o much the cheaper rate will &s;he be able to afford her commodities; and the happine&s;s of France will revert upon England. The e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of commercial powers, rivals and neighbours, far from cla&s;hing, are a reci|procal &s;upport to each other. As France increa&s;es in opulence, &s;he will draw from Great Britain a greater quantity of coals, leather, corn, lead, tin, allum, tallow, chee&s;e, rice, tobacco, &s;alt beef, &s;oap, &amp;c. Here then we &s;ee a reciprocal reverberation of mutual intere&s;t, which places the &s;y&s;tem I profe&s;s in the faire&s;t point of view; a &s;y&s;tem, the mo&s;t u&s;eful to mankind, if it could be demon&s;trated; the mo&s;t fortunate, if it could be pur&s;ued. The benefit of one party con&s;tituting the benefit of the other, it becomes their mutual intere&s;t to lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other. Every monopoly, exerci&s;ed again&s;t our neighbours, lays a new burthen upon, and injures the quality of, tho&s;e pro|ductions which mu&s;t be offered to us in return for our own. It is the &s;aying of a &s;age, that a mi&s;guided covetou&s;ne&s;s defeats its
<PB N="197" REF="215">
own purpo&s;e. Let us proceed to another article. The fi&s;hery, for example, is phy&s;ically, and even morally nece&s;&s;ary to France. A Frenchman is a fi&s;h-eater, not only from plea&s;ure, but a prin|ciple of religion. A &s;upply of fi&s;h is e&s;&s;ential to a people, who are frequently obliged to ab&s;tain from fle&s;h-meat. This nutritive art is at the &s;ame time a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen. It is their occupa|tion in time of peace. But to carry on a fi&s;hery, in order to form &s;eamen for war, is a &s;anguinary motive that tends to the de&s;truction of the &s;pecies. To carry it on for the &s;u&s;tenance of our people, is a motive of pre&s;ervation. I take it for granted then, that, to maintain that harmony of mutual intere&s;ts, which I have in view, France mu&s;t pre&s;erve an exten&s;ive cod fi&s;hery. She can no more do without it, than Holland can without the herring fi&s;hery, which is almo&s;t as e&s;&s;ential to the republic as the &s;pice trade. Her pre&s;ervation depends upon it, and upon her pre&s;ervation depends that of almo&s;t all the commerce of Europe.</P>
<P>Holland is a very rich country, almo&s;t the whole of who&s;e riches, being artificial, factitious, and of convention, exi&s;t only by commerce, by the fi&s;heries, by credit, and circulation. The ready money in Holland &s;erves as a prop to an infinity of ima|ginary riches in ve&s;&s;els, commodities, paper, and public funds; and the commercial powers of Europe are &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the Dutch, that the latter are, as it were, their factors, their partners, and, if I may be allowed to &s;ay it, their bankers. The artificial currency of Holland gives value to the artificial currency of France and England; and if, by any misfortune, the city of Am&s;terdam &s;hould happen to decline, which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e as &s;oon as her commerce, fi&s;heries, and credit fail her, from that moment the whole currency of France and England mu&s;t &s;ink prodigiou&s;ly. In the year 1763, the fall of one or
<PB N="198" REF="216">
two commercial hou&s;es in Holland produced lo&s;&s;es in all quar|ters. The commerce of Europe &s;eemed to be &s;haken. The Engli&s;h &s;tocks fell ten per cent. The convul&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by this little accident in all places of trade, &s;hows us what would be the con&s;equence of a more general failure. It is not the &s;ame with the republic of Holland, as with other &s;tates. It may be indifferent, for in&s;tance, to Europe, whether Sile&s;ia belong to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, or to the great Prince who has been able to pre&s;erve his glorious conque&s;t; although the number of men lo&s;t in the war, occa&s;ioned by this province, be not a matter of indifference to Europe. Commerce feels it. Decrea&s;e of inhabitants is decrea&s;e of con&s;umption. Whereas, if the republic of Holland were conquered, it would no longer be the &s;ame &s;tate. The &s;oil is next to nothing. The riches of Holland would di&s;appear. Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam, Middleburgh, would no longer be a bridge of communication, the mart of Europe, the magazines of the univer&s;e. Their paper, which gives value to that of every other &s;tate, would be annihilated, and choak up circulation. Millions of currency would di&s;&s;olve in an in&s;tant. Half the merchants of Europe would be ruined. Sovereigns would be affected, and half a century would not be &s;ufficient to repair the mi&s;chief. Some great revolution mu&s;t en&s;ue. I may venture then to affirm, as a principle not to be di&s;puted, that almo&s;t all the powers of Europe are intimately concerned in the pre&s;ervation of the republic. Holland is undoubtedly a ma&s;ter|piece of indu&s;try and labor. Her exi&s;tence is neverthele&s;s very precarious. It is only to the internal wi&s;dom of her govern|ment, and to the moderation of her neighbours, that &s;he owes her pre&s;ervation. I &s;ay, <HI>their moderation;</HI> for I &s;uppo&s;e them unhappily not &s;ufficiently convinced of my great principle, that the opulence of Holland communicates it&s;elf to her neighbours,
<PB N="199" REF="217">
and that the prejudice they mu&s;t &s;uffer from her de&s;truction, or decline, would be immen&s;e. The cau&s;es, which produced the greatne&s;s of the republic, no longer exi&s;t. The competition in commerce, now more exten&s;ive; Hamburgh, now become the &s;taple of the north; and other circum&s;tances, have not only &s;topped the farther progre&s;s of the republic, but have already occa&s;ioned her decline. Oeconomy, the &s;ource of her power, de|generates into a luxury incompatible with her con&s;titution. The exclu&s;ive &s;pice trade, and the herring fi&s;hery, are the only advan|tages &s;he has left for her pre&s;ervation, and to &s;upport her in that commerce, in which &s;he meets with competition. The&s;e are the two hinges, on which the remainder of the machine &s;till turns. The profits of the carrying trade, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e republicans, dimini&s;h every day. Holland was once enabled, by her commerce of oeconomy, to purcha&s;e in one country, and &s;ell in another, frequently upon cheaper terms, than if tho&s;e countries had traded directly with each other. A great kingdom may do without this trade. <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot"><P>This pa&s;&s;age can have no relation to the powers of Europe, unle&s;s &s;ome one of them &s;hould arrive at univer&s;al empire. But nothing could be more ju&s;t than Cicero's application of it to the Roman people. He thought it both di&s;|honorable and impolitic, that, in a great empire, compo&s;ed of various nations, the governing people &s;hould employ them&s;elves in any thing but governing; that, if they engaged in commerce, they &s;hould at lea&s;t ab&s;tain from the inferior branches of it; that they &s;hould leave all articles of petty profit to the nations under their &s;ubjection, and that the ma&s;ter's employment &s;hould be, as much as po&s;&s;ible, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from that of the &s;ervant. Be&s;ides the apprehen&s;ion of degrading the &s;uperior power in point of dignity and reputation, he was too wi&s;e a man not to &s;ee, and too good a man not to feel, the con&s;equence of &s;uffering the governing people to be rivals to their &s;ubjects. We our&s;elves have &s;een it in an in&s;tance perhaps of as great magnitude and importance, as any political or commercial abu&s;e, that could po&s;&s;ibly have exi&s;ted in the Roman empire. The moment our greate&s;t trading company became &s;overeigns in India, both ju&s;tice and policy required, that the per&s;ons, to whom the executive and legi&s;lative authority of their government in that country was committed, &s;hould cea&s;e to be merchants. Their engaging in the internal trade of the country amounted, in effect, to a prohibition again&s;t the natives. There can be no competition between the &s;overeign and the &s;ubject. Freedom and equality of privileges, at lea&s;t to all the &s;ubjects of the &s;ame &s;tate, are the foundation of commerce. Every exclu&s;ive privilege, every favorable di|&s;tinction, whether granted to individuals or to communities, counteract the fir&s;t principles of commerce, create monopolies, and, in&s;tead of being beneficial to trade, in general defeat the purpo&s;e they were intended to promote. But when the mo&s;t extravagant exemptions are a&s;&s;umed by authority, and maintained by violence; when the &s;overeign, or his immediate repre&s;entatives, appear in a character incompatible with their political duties; when they engage as merchants in a traffic, which their power as legi&s;lators enables them to monopoli&s;e; where could &s;o unnatural, &s;o anti-commercial a &s;y&s;tem be expected to end, but where it has done, in the ruin of trade and indu&s;try, the depopulation of the country, and finally in the de&s;truction or manife&s;t hazard of the governing power? Private plunder and rapine could have gone no farther than to the corruption of individuals, and to the annual embezzlement of the public revenue. But for the governing power to engage upon their own terms, and with the advantage of their &s;ituation, in the inland trade of the country, could not fail to de&s;troy all freedom of trade, and at once cut off the &s;ource of all future revenue. Mere peculation and mi&s;manage|ment may be recovered by care and oeconomy. But trade, once lo&s;t or diverted, is not ea&s;ily brought back to its former channel; but indu&s;try, once checked, is not ea&s;ily revived; nor is it ea&s;y to repeople a great country, of which a government equally ab&s;urd and oppre&s;&s;ive, if indeed it de&s;erves the name of government, has made a de&s;ert. You cannot recall the merchant whom you have bani&s;hed; much le&s;s can you recover the confidence of a timid, helple&s;s people, whom your tyranny has driven to de&s;pair. This at lea&s;t mu&s;t be the work of time, and the con&s;e|quence of a new &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures. Tho&s;e mea&s;ures mu&s;t be conducted by men acting under another and higher authority than that of the company; by men who&s;e great appointments leave them equally without temptation to tre&s;pa&s;s, or without excu&s;e if they depart from their duty; by men, in &s;hort, who&s;e continuance in office does not depend upon the plea&s;ure of a company, which hitherto has neither known how to reward merit, or puni&s;h demerit, among their own &s;ervants. The train of facts, to which the&s;e ob&s;ervations refer, are, by this time, tolerably well under&s;tood in England. Yet among the proceedings of the company's &s;ervants at Bengal, there is one fact, to which they have a more immediate reference, and which de&s;erves to be recorded and in&s;i&s;ted on, not only for its great &s;ingularity, but as a proof how dangerous it is to tru&s;t the mercantile &s;pirit with the powers of &s;overeignty. At the &s;ame time, when we &s;ee a rich and powerful body of men, unexpectedly involved in difficulties that approach to ruin, it may be a moral le&s;&s;on to remember, that fraud and inju&s;tice were the &s;ource of them. From the period, at which Meer Jaffier was rai&s;ed to the dignity of nabob, the company's &s;ervants began to entertain new ideas of the extent of their privileges. Under color of the original firmaun, granted to the company by the Mogol, and to which they gave their own arbitrary interpretation, they claimed, and for &s;ome years exerci&s;ed, a right of carrying on the inland trade of the country, free from any duties what|&s;oever. But the exemption, which they demanded for them&s;elves, would have been of little benefit to them, if they had &s;uffered it to be extended to the natives of the country. Not contented with paying no duties them&s;elves, they in&s;i&s;ted that no relief &s;hould be given to the country merchants; and when Co&s;&s;im Ally Kawn, the nominal &s;overeign of the country, &s;eeing his revenues reduced to nothing, his own merchants excluded from a traffic which naturally belonged to them, his officers in&s;ulted, and his &s;ubjects univer&s;ally oppre&s;&s;ed, had determined to lay the trade open by aboli&s;hing all duties what&s;oever in his dominions, it was re&s;olved by a great majority of the council at Fort William, that this ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary act of &s;overeignty was a breach of the company's privileges, and that the nabob &s;hould be po&s;itively required to recall it. If we &s;hudder at the ma&s;&s;acre of a &s;mall number of our own countrymen, is it po&s;&s;ible to reflect without indignation upon the conduct of a &s;et of men, who&s;e avarice, folly, and inju&s;tice, were not only the cau&s;e of that &s;hocking event, but of the murder of thou&s;ands, and of the ruin of millions? In this country we have already &s;everely felt the effect of a &s;udden glut of wealth, acquired without indu&s;try, and unnaturally forced without dige&s;tion into the ma&s;s of circulation. But of evils of this kind we &s;hall probably have no rea&s;on to complain hereafter. Inanition is the natural remedy of repletion. The fir&s;t &s;tep to a reformation of abu&s;es in India is to confine the merchant, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to that trade which is properly his bu&s;ine&s;s. That the &s;ame per&s;ons, who act as merchants upon the &s;pot, &s;hould enjoy any &s;hare in the &s;overeign or executive power, is almo&s;t as evident a contradiction to natural ju&s;tice, as that the party &s;hould be judge.</P>
<P>The reflections, contained in <HI>A View of the Engli&s;h Government in Bengal,</HI> upon the impo&s;&s;ibility of introducing our laws into that country, are drawn up with equal &s;trength of argument, and elegance of compo&s;ition. Yet, I think, the author has concluded too ha&s;tily, at lea&s;t without premi&s;es &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy a reader otherwi&s;e uninformed, that a new arrangement will <HI>&s;oon</HI> revive the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, bring the wa&s;te lands into cultivation, re&s;tore the manufactures and internal trade of the country, and improve the revenue. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Bengal may reach a height of pro&s;perity heretofore unknown in India. The wounds, which this country has &s;u&s;tained, are great; and the checks, which indu&s;try has here received, might, in a more northern climate, almo&s;t &s;tarve a people. But in Bengal, where the demands of nature are few, where manufactures, from various cau&s;es, have been pre&s;erved amid&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolutions, the&s;e lo&s;&s;es will be quickly retrieved."</Q> It is much to be feared, that all the&s;e good purpo&s;es will not be &s;o ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed, as the author apprehends. If in Bengal the wants of nature are few, how does it happen, that they are &s;o ill &s;upplied, that provinces are &s;ometimes depopulated by famine? Should it be &s;aid, that the&s;e calamitous accounts have been gro&s;sly exaggerated on one &s;ide, to &s;erve an intere&s;ted purpo&s;e, there may be rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that they are palliated with &s;ome intention on the other. It may be doubted whether the promi&s;e of a better government for the future will recall the inhabitant, whom the experience of the wor&s;t government po&s;&s;ible has driven away, and who has either peri&s;hed in mi&s;ery, or found a &s;ettlement el&s;ewhere. It may be que&s;tioned whether trade, though invited by every advantage of climate and &s;ituation, will &s;o ea&s;ily revert to a channel it has once de&s;erted; and when we con&s;ider with what cruelty the manu|facturers have been treated, and how long their country has been the &s;eat of war, plunder, and oppre&s;&s;ion, we may rea&s;onably doubt the po&s;&s;ibility of manufactures having been pre&s;erved in any degree of elegance or perfection. General maxims, founded upon the invariable experience of other nations, certainly make again&s;t the author, and exceptions to &s;uch maxims require a clear explanation. Some of the letters from the &s;elect committee acknowledge the almo&s;t total lo&s;s of the foreign trade, without any pro&s;pect of recovering it. The annual balance of that trade, in favor of Bengal, amounted, not many years ago, to more than a million &s;terling, but was reduced to nothing in the year 1767. A melancholy proof of the decay of manufactures, <HI>which formerly found their way to the remote&s;t parts of Indo&s;tan, when &s;pecie flowed in by a thou&s;and channels, which are at pre&s;ent lo&s;t or ob&s;tructed;</HI> and that the &s;elect committee and Mr. Verel&s;t him&s;elf had too much rea&s;on to de&s;cribe Bengal, as <HI>a &s;inking country&mdash;a declining and exhau&s;ted country.</HI> Vide page 59 and 87 of the Appendix.<HI>&mdash;Tran&s;lator.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>Nolo eundem populum imperatorem et portitorem e&s;&s;e terrarum.</HI> I do not like, &s;ays Tully, that the &s;ame people &s;hall be at once the lords and carriers of the world.</P>

<P>I return to Holland, which I con&s;ider as the rudder of the commercial ve&s;&s;el of Europe. She furni&s;hes the &s;ails too. It is &s;he that blows the gale of factitious credit, and facilitates the motion of a very heavy machine.

It is an old oak, who&s;e leaves &s;till appear green, but who&s;e root begins to decay, and that threatens to cru&s;h its neighbours by its fall. <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">The&s;e metaphors are too much crouded, and not &s;trictly correct.

extent, that has no arable land, no woods, no vineyards, no mines, who&s;e &s;oil is ungrateful, barren and expen&s;ive, &s;hould not be the object of jealou&s;y. To envy her commerce and her fi&s;heries, is a &s;ignal inju&s;tice, to which the apologue of the prophet to David may well be applied. This inju&s;tice mu&s;t appear the greater, as it is contrary to the intere&s;t of tho&s;e who are guilty of it, con&s;idering the con&s;umption of their commo|dities and manufactures in Holland. The artificial currency of Holland &s;upports that of France and England, and vice vers&acirc;. The&s;e three powers, by their reciprocal harmony, partake of the commerce of Spain, that mother from whom they derive their nouri&s;hment, and who perhaps feels the effect of nouri&s;h|ing three &s;uch children. France derives a con&s;iderable advan|tage from the riches of Holland, in the large con&s;umption of her wines, and in the utterance of her manufactures of all &s;orts. France unque&s;tionably gains more by the opulence of Holland, than &s;he would have done if Lewis XIV. had &s;ucceeded in de|&s;troying the republic. England al&s;o has her advantage, &s;ince &s;he &s;ells to the Dutch more than &s;he buys of them. They &s;upply her with money in time of war. Holland &s;erved as a bridge of communication in the la&s;t war, and with no le&s;s benefit to France than to England. Holland, it is true, has
<PB N="205" REF="223">
profited by it. But ought this to be a &s;ubject of jealou&s;y? It is an accidental tribute, which her &s;ituation makes nece&s;&s;ary to her. Without &s;uch ca&s;ual profits, and without her &s;pices, the commerce of the republic mu&s;t long &s;ince have been annihilated. A fall of the fortune of Holland would revert, with &s;en&s;ible mi&s;chief, upon the commerce of France and England. Hitherto the competitors of the Dutch have frequently benefited them&s;elves at their expence, becau&s;e the Dutch had traded with &s;carce any competition, and by a concurrence of various accidents had for &s;ome time enjoyed an almo&s;t univer&s;al and exclu&s;ive commerce. But tho&s;e times are pa&s;t. To cavil with them upon the little they have left, cannot but be prejudicial to Europe in general, and in particular to the cavillers them&s;elves. It appears then clearly from all that has been &s;aid, that all the powers are in|tere&s;ted in pre&s;erving Holland in her pre&s;ent &s;tate. <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><P>Though we &s;hould agree with the author in his main propo&s;ition, that Holland, in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, is not an object of jealou&s;y, and that it is the gene|ral intere&s;t of Europe to &s;upport the republic; his way of proving it does not &s;eem quite conclu&s;ive, nor con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome of his own principles. If Holland be in reality &s;o de&s;titute, as he repre&s;ents her, of all internal re&s;ources, it follows, that whatever wealth &s;he acquires mu&s;t, &s;ome way or other, be at the expence of her neighbours. If commerce be a game, and there be no winning with beggars, upon what terms is an opulent nation to trade with a people, who have neither commodities to exchange for ours, nor &s;pecie to pay for what they purcha&s;e? Such a people may not now be the object of jealou&s;y, but their operations &s;hould at all times be ob&s;erved with &s;u&s;picion; and though at pre&s;ent there be but little appearance of their being able to renew tho&s;e &s;cenes of fraud and violence, to which, much more than to their indu&s;try, they are indebted for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mo&s;t lucrative branches of their trade, the character which produced tho&s;e &s;cenes, if it &s;hould not appear to be greatly improved, de&s;erves a con&s;tant attention. The offen&s;ive part of it &s;hould &s;et other trading nations upon their guard. The prudent part of it may &s;erve them for an example. Their policy in purcha&s;ing raw materials from their neighbours, in order to employ their own manufacturers, is certainly not to be condemned. Yet the fact, upon the face of it, &s;uppo&s;es them to exi&s;t by a trade of contraband. Their neighbours are them&s;elves manufacturers, and the laws of every manufacturing nation concur in prohibiting the exportation of raw materials. The &s;pice trade is their own, and they po&s;&s;e&s;s it without a rival.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to their fi&s;heries, the &s;ea is undoubtedly open to their indu&s;try. Whatever they draw from that &s;ource, is an addition of wealth to the common &s;tock of Europe. But whether the liberty of fi&s;hing in the open &s;eas implies a right of fi&s;hing immediately upon the coa&s;ts of their neighbours, is a que&s;tion of greater political than commercial importance. It is no le&s;s than whether the immediate coa&s;ts of a maritime &s;tate make part of its territorial domain. If they do not, we have no property in our creeks, bays, rivers, or any other waters, that communicate with the &s;ea. A neutral power has no right to prohibit acts of ho&s;tility between neighbouring powers at war with each other, though they &s;hould be committed within a few yards of the &s;hore, or even in their harbours. If they do, the &s;tranger who without licence avails him&s;elf of the produce of the &s;ea upon that coa&s;t, invades his neighbour's territorial right. The next &s;tep is to reap the harve&s;t upon the &s;hore. Rights of property, among nations as well as among individuals, are po&s;itive, and, for the peace of &s;ociety, mu&s;t be &s;trictly pre&s;erved. In former times, the Dutch never pre&s;umed to begin their fi&s;hery upon the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, without fir&s;t obtaining leave from the governors of Scarborough ca&s;tle. The man, who takes what belongs to his neighbour, though for an innocent or u&s;eful purpo&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hes a dangerous precedent again&s;t him&s;elf. Pretences for in|ju&s;tice are but too ea&s;ily invented. But &s;uppo&s;ing the right to be in theory as doubtful and ob&s;cure, as the learning of a Selden and a Grotius can make it, there is no doubt what&s;oever, that the exerci&s;e of it mu&s;t always be invidious, and natu|rally tend to create jealou&s;y and ill blood between nations, that otherwi&s;e might live in amity, and pur&s;ue their &s;eparate intere&s;ts without interfering with each other.</P>
<P>Through all this author's writings there is an apparent bia&s;s in favor of Holland, which, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a native of that country, does him no di&s;honor. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary that the tran&s;lator, or the reader, &s;hould implicitly adopt every opinion of the author; nor does it le&s;&s;en the merit of an ingenious writer, that all his opinions are not to be adopted. The be&s;t book is not that, perhaps, which contains the greate&s;t quantity of direct information; but rather that which invites, or compels the reader to think for him&s;elf. Wealth and indolence have the mean, unhappy privilege of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting upon the genius, or indu&s;try, of others. If the cultivation and improvement of our faculties were regarded, we &s;hould prefer that kind of in&s;truction, which leaves &s;omething for our&s;elves to fini&s;h, which &s;upplies us with the raw materials of thinking, and &s;ets the under&s;tanding to work.

will be impo&s;&s;ible, if &s;he be thwarted in tho&s;e objects which are e&s;&s;ential to her pre&s;ervation. The commerce of the republic is more precarious than that of any other power. We have &s;een
<PB N="207" REF="225">
a perfect picture of it in tho&s;e well dige&s;ted remon&s;trances, which were pre&s;ented by &s;ome able merchants to the late &s;tadtholder, of glorious memory, a little before his death. They went back to the original cau&s;es, which, in former times, &s;o prodigiou&s;ly favored a commerce e&s;fential to the con&s;titution of the &s;tate, marking out, and di&s;tingui&s;hing at the &s;ame time, tho&s;e cau&s;es of its decline which are inevitable, from tho&s;e which might &s;till admit of a remedy. The following, as well as I can recollect, are the topics, on which this important memorial turned.</P>
<P>They &s;et forth the total change of &s;y&s;tem in the commerce of Europe, and examined into the cau&s;es, which formerly con|curred in fixing it, with &s;o much advantage, in the republic. In tracing the&s;e original cau&s;es, they di&s;tingui&s;hed, fir&s;t the phy&s;ical, &s;econdly the moral, and la&s;tly the accidental cau&s;es, which had concurred with the others. The phy&s;ical cau&s;es, for in&s;tance, con&s;i&s;t in the advantageous &s;ituation of the country. The republic, placed between the northern and &s;outhern &s;eas, &s;tands as a centre to Europe, and of cour&s;e lies conveniently for traders of all nations to make it an univer&s;al &s;taple. Here they a&s;&s;embled from every quarter to exchange their merchan|di&s;es, &s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ome with the &s;uperfluity of others to their mutual advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="226">
The barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil contributed to their &s;ucce&s;s, by compelling the inhabitants to exert their indu&s;try to provide them&s;elves with the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It made them more indu&s;trious, more laborious, and obliged them to &s;eek for that &s;upply in other countries, which failed them in their own. The &s;ituation of the republic puts it in her reach to avail her&s;elf of the fi&s;hery in the neighbouring &s;eas, where the abundance of fi&s;h has not only enabled her to provide for her own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but to &s;upply foreigners. In the produce of her fi&s;hery &s;he finds a compen&s;ation for that dearth of provi&s;ions, which attends a barren &s;oil, and a very limited territory.</P>
<P>Among the moral cau&s;es we may reckon liberty of con&s;cience, as one of the means which have contributed mo&s;t to people the Seven Provinces, by inviting a multitude of foreigners to re&s;ide there. The protection, granted to foreigners again&s;t the vio|lence of per&s;ecution, has been another &s;ource of opulence. The Dutch have profited by the perfecutions in other countries. Strangers, who found an a&s;ylum here, brought with them not only their property and their money, but their indu&s;try; intro|ducing various fabrics, manufactures, trades, arts, and &s;ciences; and this too, in &s;pite of the difficulty they met with, in finding them&s;elves unprovided with all the elements or fir&s;t materials of manufactures, which the country it&s;elf does not produce, and which they are obliged to import from abroad at a con&s;iderable expence.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of their government, and the civil liberty re&s;ulting from it, has contributed not a little to the pro&s;perity of their commerce. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice has always been unblemi&s;hed, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. It were to be wi&s;hed, that we had equal rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with the &s;peedy di&s;patch of proceedings, &s;ince this point has a great influence upon com|merce.
<PB N="209" REF="227">
Among the moral and political cau&s;es of their former &s;ucce&s;s in commerce, we may reckon their wi&s;e policy and cir|cum&s;pection in avoiding war, and pre&s;erving peace, without looking for chimerical advantages in ruinous wars. Such are the political maxims which have con&s;tituted the glory of the republic, which have in&s;pired foreigners with that confidence they have always repo&s;ed in her government, and which of cour&s;e have invited a multitude of u&s;eful citizens, who have increa&s;ed her commerce and her riches.</P>
<P>Among the accidental and external cau&s;es, which have con|tributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of her commerce, the following may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>At the time when the republic put in practice the wi&s;e maxims, which &s;he had adopted for protecting her trade, that of her neighbours was almo&s;t entirely neglected. We need only read the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times to &s;ee how much the per&s;ecution, on the &s;core of religion, in Spain, Flanders, and other king|doms, have contributed to advance the commerce of the republic. The civil wars in France and Germany, and after|wards in England, have contributed not a little to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of her manufactures. In the very heat of the war, which Holland maintained again&s;t Spain and Portugal, a period in other re&s;pects ruinous to commerce, tho&s;e two powers neglected their marine, while that of the republic grew formidable, and was at once in a condition to protect her own commerce, and to de&s;troy that of her enemies. Such are the principal cau&s;es which have e&s;tabli&s;hed and encouraged the commerce of the republic. Before we &s;peak of its actual &s;tate, it may be proper to enquire which of the&s;e cau&s;es &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and which have di&s;appeared; the &s;ure&s;t way to di&s;cover the means of promoting commerce in its different branches.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="228">
As to natural and phy&s;ical cau&s;es, it is certain that things are nearly in the &s;ame &s;ituation, except perhaps &s;ome little alteration in the mouths of rivers, where &s;and may have collected, and made the pa&s;&s;age of ve&s;&s;els more difficult. As to the &s;ea, the Dutch had once the &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fi&s;hery. At pre&s;ent they &s;hare it with their neighbours. From thence ari&s;es the diminution of their herring, cod, and whale fi&s;hery. As to accidental cau&s;es, and any changes among the powers which &s;urround the republic, it cannot be denied that revolutions have happened, fatal to her commerce, which had thriven by the per&s;ecutions in other countries, by the contempt her neighbours entertained for commerce, their negligence in the practice, and their ignorance of the theory. All the&s;e circum&s;tances are evidently altered. The powers of Europe have adopted the maxims of the republic. With the advantages of &s;oil and territorial production, they vie with each other in protecting trade, manufactures, fabrics, and fi&s;hery. This cannot but have a fatal influence upon the commerce of &s;o &s;mall a &s;tate. She feels too &s;en&s;ibly the progre&s;s of her neighbours. Our Dutch mer|chants complain, that formerly they &s;upplied the north and ea&s;t country with the productions, fruits, and commodities, of France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, and the&s;e in return with the productions of the former; whereas, at pre&s;ent, the expence of freight and other charges are managed without them. It is but a very few years &s;ince Am&s;terdam was a general magazine, of indigo among the re&s;t, and other drugs u&s;ed in dyeing. Hardly any traces of it remain at pre&s;ent. Germany has begun for &s;ome years to import directly what merchandi&s;es &s;he wants from France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, introducing them by way of Altena and Hamburgh.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="229">
The merchants ob&s;erved that, by the la&s;t accounts of the exportation of &s;ugar, coffee, and indigo, from the 1&s;t of June, 1750, to the 31&s;t of May, 1751, and by a compari&s;on of the &s;ame articles exported from Nantz to Am&s;terdam and Ham|burgh, from the 1&s;t of October, 1750, to the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1751, it appears that not above a fourth of tho&s;e articles were &s;hipped for Holland, and that the remaining three fourths were &s;hipped directly for Hamburgh. A little before this period, the proportion was in the inver&s;e ratio.</P>
<P>Where are now, &s;ay the merchants, tho&s;e ladings which we formerly u&s;ed to &s;ee of hemp, flax, and other merchandi&s;es of the Baltic, for Spain, France, and Portugal? We need only con&s;ult the regi&s;ters of the Sound, to &s;ee that all the&s;e nations import tho&s;e merchandi&s;es without our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. We no longer &s;ee any Dutch hou&s;es in Spain. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how little the republic is concerned in the galloons, and how low her Levant trade is fallen. The great number of pre&s;&s;es for printing cotton, hou&s;es for refining of &s;ugars, and other fabrics e&s;tabli&s;hed within a &s;hort time pa&s;t at Hamburgh and Bremen, and very lately in Flanders and Brabant, are &s;o many proofs of a decay in the commerce of the republic. Formerly &s;he alone carried on the trade of all Europe. Strangers paid her without enquiry whatever &s;he demanded, their ignorance in matter of commerce not permitting them to think of reducing their expences by means of a direct navigation. But &s;ince the la&s;t century, the &s;y&s;tem of Europe is wholly changed. Foreign nations ob&s;erved, that it was by commerce only that the republic had arrived at that degree of power. This con&s;ideration, added to that of the taxes they paid in Holland, &s;ugge&s;ted to them the idea not only of applying them&s;elves to commerce, but of doing entirely without the Dutch, by conveying the &s;uperfluity of their
<PB N="212" REF="230">
own productions directly to the places where the con&s;umption was greate&s;t, and, on the other hand, by repairing to the fountain head for what they wanted them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Such are, in general, the chief cau&s;es of the greatne&s;s and decay of the commerce of Holland. Exce&s;&s;ive taxes, cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duties, and other impo&s;itions, with which the nece&s;&s;ities of the public have loaded commerce, operate as acce&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, have ha&s;tened, and continue to ha&s;ten its decline. On this &s;ide the merchants affirmed that the remedy mu&s;t be &s;ought; or at lea&s;t that the duties mu&s;t be dimini&s;hed, to &s;top the progre&s;s of the decay. A deep enquiry into this matter would lead us too far, and does not concern the re&s;t of Europe. I &s;hall only repeat that they ob&s;erved, that an increa&s;e of the duties of impor|tation at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e is fallacious; and they proved it thus. After the &s;evere winter of the year 1740, all the produce of the earth being de&s;troyed, the mortality which happened among the cattle occa&s;ioned a con&s;iderable increa&s;e in the revenues of the cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e, on account of the great introduction of foreign com|modities and foreign cattle, to an&s;wer the internal con&s;umption. We &s;hould be gro&s;sly deceived, if we attributed this kind of increa&s;e to any augmentation of commerce. The Engli&s;h give a drawback, or re&s;titution of the duties of importation upon commodities and merchandi&s;es of pa&s;&s;age, in order to favor the exportation and &s;ale in foreign countries; the &s;ign of a flouri&s;hing commerce. There is this difference between Holland and other commercial countries, that, having unfortunately &s;carce any thing of her own growth, her commerce, as far as it concerns navigation, con&s;i&s;ts &s;olely in the exchange of foreign commodities introduced for the &s;ingle purpo&s;e of &s;ending them abroad; an operation which &s;hould be favored and encouraged in the republic by every method imaginable. If exce&s;&s;ive luxury had not altered the manners of the
<PB N="213" REF="231">
Dutch, this country would be the only one proper for a general fair. The oeconomy of the inhabitants, <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">There is not perhaps oeconomy enough in the genius of the Engli&s;h to qualify them for &s;ucceeding in any branch of trade, or in any other enterpri&s;e, in which they mu&s;t, ab initio, be contented to take a great deal of pains, without the hopes of more than a moderate profit. Perhaps the form and magnitude of their commerce place them above the nece&s;&s;ity of little traffic, which pa&s;&s;es under the name of Pedling. A kingdom, that has a great &s;tock of its own, and that can pre&s;erve it&s;elf without a great naval power, may certainly do without the carrying trade; that is, its people may be better employed. It is al&s;o true, in a mere com|mercial view to profit, that, &s;ince every advance upon the freight is in effect an advance in the price of all imports and exports, it is both the merchant's and the con&s;umer's intere&s;t to employ tho&s;e carriers who &s;erve them upon the mo&s;t mode|rate terms. But, be&s;ides that there is a wide difference between not carrying for others, and employing others to carry for us, a great maritime power mu&s;t attend to the increa&s;e and maintenance of a large body of &s;eamen. We may be hu&s;band|men and manufacturers; but if we do not trade in our own &s;hips, and navigate them with our own &s;eamen, we mu&s;t renounce that naval &s;uperiority, which, if it were not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;ecurity, &s;hould be &s;till maintained for o&s;tentation. A real, or fancied national pre-eminence cannot be purcha&s;ed too dear. It exalts the &s;pirit of the people, and qualifies them for great actions. It is in view to this object, and to the &s;ecurity of the dependence of the colonies on the mother country, that the navigation act may be &s;aid to be founded in principles of political wi&s;dom. The commercial intere&s;t, &s;ingly con&s;idered, of a nation that has an exten&s;ive territory to cultivate, and a great natural produce to di&s;po&s;e of, does not, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance at lea&s;t, depend upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, or &s;eamen.

To the &s;ituation of the republic, to the rivers and canals which inter&s;ect the country, we may add the oeconomy of her inha|bitants. In this article their &s;eafaring people &s;urpa&s;s every other nation. They equip a ve&s;&s;el with eighteen men, for which other nations require twenty-&s;ix or twenty eight. The &s;paring diet of their &s;eamen, the con&s;truction of their ve&s;&s;els, and the long time they make them la&s;t by a cleanline&s;s which appears trifling; all the&s;e circum&s;tances united, enable the Dutch to be the carriers of certain articles at a lower rate than any other nation. It is unju&s;t to envy them &s;uch an advantage. The abundance of money among them, and the moderate profits that &s;atisfy the Dutch, are benefits that revert upon their neighbours. It is not fair then to cavil with them continually, or to deprive them from day to day of tho&s;e feeble advantages of which they &s;till pre&s;erve &s;o incon&s;iderable a &s;hare. But without entering into a more minute detail, I flatter my&s;elf this picture &s;hows, that the commerce of Holland, upon its pre&s;ent footing, far from being an object of jealou&s;y to her neighbours, ought, on the contrary, to be con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;ary to their own pre&s;ervation and pro&s;perity; that any greater decay of it mu&s;t be attended with ruin to the republic; and that her ruin would be the cau&s;e of irreparable mi&s;chief to the re&s;t of Europe, who&s;e commerce pro&s;pers by that circulation and con&s;umption, which Holland maintains in a greater degree than any other nation.

When the con&s;umption of any com|modity is arrived at its highe&s;t period of gradation, the quantity cannot be increa&s;ed without over&s;tocking the trade, which ends in a decay. Nature has pre&s;cribed limits to the human &s;tature, on either &s;ide of which &s;he makes dwarfs or giants; &s;o, with regard to the happie&s;t con&s;titution of a &s;tate, there is a certain boundary, to which it ought to reach, and beyond which it ought not to be extended. In every political body there is a maximum of &s;trength, not to be exceeded. Beyond that point, to aggran|di&s;e is to enervate. In &s;ome ca&s;es, undoubtedly, a moiety is worth more than the whole. The Midas of the fable may be found in hi&s;tory. Every nation, I think, &s;hould be divided into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es. In each order of &s;ociety, the number &s;hould be proportioned to the rank; that is, the inferior ranks &s;hould be the mo&s;t numerous; otherwi&s;e the harmony of the &s;tate is di&s;compo&s;ed. The proportion I &s;peak of &s;hould re|&s;emble the &s;tructure of a pyramid, enlarging in extent as it approaches to its ba&s;is. A body too great for its con&s;titution depre&s;&s;es it&s;elf, and &s;inks under its own weight. Let us, for a moment, conceive a &s;tate, in which every body &s;hould be rich. It could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without calling in the &s;ervice of indigent foreigners. The &s;overeign power is the &s;ummit of the building; it &s;hould be &s;ingle in it&s;elf, and gradually &s;upported by the in&s;erior orders, of which the people are the foundation. Too much wealth, whether accumulated or di&s;per&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;es us to wi&s;h for a pyramid, while we de&s;troy the e&s;&s;ence of it, or that a body may be &s;upported without feet.

They will improve in fertility, and human nature will profit by it. I &s;ee the truth, though faintly. I feel it my&s;elf.

The labor and indu&s;try of many are infinitely more u&s;eful to the &s;overeign, than the accumulated riches of a few. There is then a maximum for riches al&s;o.

very often happens, that nothing is le&s;s true than what appears mo&s;t probable. An apparent pro&s;perity is frequently a ma&s;k to the ruin of the &s;tate. A great misfortune &s;ometimes brings great advantages along with it. Take the following in&s;tance. The lo&s;s of Minorca, which the Engli&s;h &s;uffered in the beginning of the war, &s;eemed to threaten them with &s;till greater di&s;a&s;ters, and to be greatly to their di&s;advantage. Far otherwi&s;e. Be&s;ides that this extraordinary event rou&s;ed the nation, who&s;e errors are &s;oon corrected by their fortunate con&s;titution, and where concord often ari&s;es from di&s;union it&s;elf, as harmony in mu&s;ic re&s;ults from di&s;cords.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of Minorca made them &s;till greater mariners than they were, by forcing them to defy all &s;ea&s;ons in the Mediter|ranean; the Engli&s;h &s;quadrons formerly loitered at Mahon, and the porters of the Mediterranean frequently left the key in the door. In the war of 1744, we have often &s;een the French and Spani&s;h &s;quadrons unite, and &s;ail into or out of the Mediter|ranean, while the Engli&s;h were at Minorca. In the la&s;t war, <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">(5.) The action, to which the author refers, happened on the 28th of February, 1758.

Upon this &s;ingle event perhaps may have depended almo&s;t all their &s;ub&s;equent &s;ucce&s;&s;es in America.

<P><PB N="218" REF="236">
The &s;ymptoms of opulence in a &s;tate are often equivocal. An increa&s;e, for in&s;tance, in the revenue of the cu&s;toms, is a very defective barometer to determine whether commerce flouri&s;hes or not. Exportation is the only criterion. It appears that, from the year 1740, the revenue of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, which they call the Admiralty in Holland, had increa&s;ed con|&s;iderably; yet, that this augmentation was ruinous to the &s;tate, becau&s;e it aro&s;e from a mortality among the horned cattle, large &s;upplies of which were introduced from Denmark, and paid for with money that never returned. In the &s;ame manner, if England purcha&s;es more foreign commodities to &s;upply her colonies, the revenue of the cu&s;toms may increa&s;e, to the pre|judice of the kingdom; unle&s;s the return from the colonies &s;hall introduce, in exchange, a &s;uperabundance of commodities, which, being carried to a foreign market, may make good the fir&s;t lo&s;s, and convert it into a real profit. Time will prove the advantage; a good admini&s;tration may procure it. Markets, at which the growing manufactures of a country may be di&s;po&s;ed of, are a real advantage, becau&s;e they nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the number of manufacturers, and con&s;equently population and con&s;umption. Manufactures u&s;ually invite foreigners, who repair the breach made by the colonies in the population of the mother country. All the&s;e principles mu&s;t be combined, to judge of the importance and utility of a new colony.</P>
<P>If then it be almo&s;t problematical, whether great acqui&s;itions, in con&s;equence of great &s;ucce&s;&s;es in war, be hardly a compen&s;a|tion for the evils it creates; &s;o much the more rea&s;on is there never to commence a war in the uncertainty of &s;ucce&s;s. If we rea&s;oned from our principles, this &s;hould henceforward be the age of peace; &s;ince, it &s;eems, it is the general wi&s;h, that com|merce
<PB N="219" REF="237">
&s;hould be protected in the principal countries of Europe, in France, England, Spain, Holland, Portugal, and all the north. It is the general intere&s;t of the&s;e powers to maintain a profound peace, and to compo&s;e or bani&s;h tho&s;e petty di&s;putes among princes, which tend to involve their neighbours in a war. While the commercial powers are united in eluding all occa&s;ions of war, it may with ea&s;e be avoided. One great difficulty pre&s;ents it&s;elf, I confe&s;s; the Engli&s;h, for their own &s;ecurity, to &s;upport their &s;plendor, and to indulge their ta&s;te for expence, and the genero&s;ity natural to the nation, think they &s;hould maintain a &s;uperiority at &s;ea. Their &s;ituation, the con|&s;titution of their government, and that exten&s;ive commerce, which they &s;eem to have more need of than any other power, appear to require it. But it is not yet time to enter into the detail of this important que&s;tion. Let us fir&s;t &s;ay a word of the India trade.</P>
<P>The commerce to the Indies is &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;tructive, on account of the money &s;ent thither, if a con&s;iderable part of the returns are not again di&s;po&s;ed of to foreigners. The great prin|ciple however, univer&s;ally cited, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That, if we are obliged to purcha&s;e the commodities of India from foreigners for our own con&s;umption, it is rather our intere&s;t to import them our&s;elves, may be liable to &s;ome exceptions;"</Q> for this rea&s;on. The money we carry into A&s;ia is lo&s;t to Europe; whereas the money we &s;pend among our neighbours increa&s;es the general circulation, and we our&s;elves profit by it. The greater num|ber of rivals we &s;end into A&s;ia, &s;o much the more do we advance the price of India goods, &s;o many more ri&s;ques do we run, and &s;o much the more do we reciprocally injure one another.</P>
<P>This trade, at fir&s;t &s;o lucrative to one or two nations, is at length become of little importance, not to &s;ay more, to the
<PB N="220" REF="238">
others that have engaged in it. It is inconvenient, therefore, that all the powers &s;hould meddle with it; I mean, it is not for the general intere&s;t of Europe. Upon this point I have hardly courage to deliver my opinion; I leave it to men of greater abilities and experience to unfold, and go to the bottom of my own principles. This alone I believe I may a&s;&s;ert, that it is for the benefit of all Europe, that the Dutch in particular &s;hould pre&s;erve a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the India trade, e&s;pecially in the articles of &s;pice and cinnamon. If France or England po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Moluccas, Ceylon, Peru, Mexico, and the Bra|zils, they would in a little time engro&s;s all the money in Europe, and be made unhappy by the di&s;proportion among the inferior cla&s;&s;es, &s;o productive of di&s;&s;en&s;ion and cabal, and by the jealou&s;y of all their neighbours, who&s;e poverty would make them formidable. In a great kingdom the gradations from opulence to poverty &s;hould be numerous; and at every &s;tep of the de&s;cent, the number of individuals &s;hould be greatly augmented.</P>
<P>The republic of Holland is not an active, dangerous power, but pa&s;&s;ive and vivifying. Amid&s;t the mar&s;hes &s;he has drained, &s;he has no re&s;ource but commerce, no &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but indu&s;try. Peace is her element. The pre&s;ervation of her &s;tate is all her ambition. She is &s;erviceable to her neighbours, and can never give umbrage while they leave her unmole&s;ted. Yet, if driven to de&s;pair, &s;he might &s;till become formidable. Without the herring fi&s;hery (by two thirds le&s;s at pre&s;ent than it was before the wars with Cromwell and Charles II.) and without the India and carrying trade, the republic could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. It is the intere&s;t of Europe to maintain her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e three objects, for the general good, and to &s;upport the actual &s;y&s;tem of Europe, the &s;y&s;tem of commerce, credit, circulation,
<PB N="221" REF="239">
public funds, imaginary and artificial riches, manufactures, and luxury. Few people know that Holland, maintained in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, is one of the main arches of the building. If ever, as appearances &s;eem to threaten, the mines of Mexico and Peru &s;hould be exhau&s;ted like tho&s;e of Spain, this whole &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t fall to the ground. From that moment the India trade will become, in every &s;en&s;e, pernicious, and impoveri&s;h Europe. All the currency of paper credit will vani&s;h; the e&s;tabli&s;hments and fortunes of individuals will be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively and rapidly over-turned. There will be a revolution in the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem. But this event being yet at a di&s;tance, it is certain, that the Dutch, by means of an artificial circulation &s;upported by a due proportion of &s;pecie, and by means of their oeconomy, may &s;upply their neighbours, from one to the other, with commo|dities cheaper than if they were directly to import them them|&s;elves. No other nation has &s;ucceeded in pickling herrings, either &s;o well, or at &s;o low a rate. Their neighbours, I pre&s;ume, would gain more by furni&s;hing them with &s;alt, than by engaging in the pickling trade them&s;elves. This &s;upports one of the principles I advanced in the beginning of my letter.</P>
<P>If the harmony of the political picture of commercial Europe be attended to, it will be found, that it is no way incompatible with the common intere&s;t of all parties, that the mines of Peru &s;hould belong to Spain, tho&s;e of Brazil to Portugal, the &s;pice trade and herring fi&s;hery to Holland; the &s;ugars, indigo, and other produce of St. Domingo, Martinique, and Guadeloupe, as well as a &s;hare in the great fi&s;heries, to France; and that England, at the &s;ame time, may and ought to pre&s;erve an univer&s;al command over all the commerce, of which North America, Jamaica, and the Great Indies (except the Moluccas and Ceylon) are the ba&s;is. If the principal &s;ugar colonies
<PB N="222" REF="240">
belonged to the Engli&s;h, their commerce with Portugal might &s;uffer by it. I believe the Engli&s;h, by their commerce, encou|rage the produce of the Brazils, and are well rewarded for it by the tribute they draw from that country. But it cannot be denied, that it is the intere&s;t of all Europe, that the principal &s;ugar colonies &s;hould belong to France, in order to &s;upply the con&s;umption of Germany, and the trade of Holland. Fir&s;t, becau&s;e France can furni&s;h &s;ugar at a lower rate, which is an immediate advantage to Germany, Holland, and the north country. Secondly, if England had all the other &s;ugar colonies, tho&s;e of Brazil would be u&s;ele&s;s to Portugal. That kingdom would &s;uffer by it; and England, in the diminution of her Por|tugal trade, would lo&s;e a great part of the exce&s;&s;ive, but falla|cious profits, which &s;he might gain on the other &s;ide, to the prejudice of all Europe. If I were better acquainted with the detail of commerce, I am per&s;uaded that other examples might be produced in &s;upport of the&s;e principles. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Note at the end of the Letter.</NOTE> England is united with Portugal by mutual intere&s;ts; their reciprocal commerce is nece&s;&s;ary to the two nations; one con&s;umes the produce of the other, without any great di&s;advantage to other powers, who enjoy other compen&s;ations.</P>
<P>Let it not be thought that I mean to introduce into politics the optimi&s;m of Leibnitz. I do not pretend to &s;ay that all is exactly right; &s;ome arrangements might certainly be better than they are. But I affirm, that all the commercial powers may, in time of peace and on the pre&s;ent footing, &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a &s;tate of pro&s;perity; and if there be any branch of commerce not exactly in its place, or which we may think we have occa&s;ion for, it is better to go without it, than, in order to obtain it, to engage in a war which de&s;troys all the other branches. It is better to

endure a &s;light di&s;temper, than to ruin the con&s;titution by violent remedies.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age in the Hi&s;tory of the Age of Lewis XIV. by Voltaire, is worth quoting. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In Chri&s;tian monarchies, the people have &s;carce ever any intere&s;t in the wars carried on by their &s;overeigns. Mercenary armies, rai&s;ed by order of a mini&s;ter, and commanded by a general, who blindly obeys that mini&s;ter, make &s;everal ruinous campaigns; while the princes, in who&s;e name they fight, neither expect nor intend to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the patrimony of each other. The nation that conquers, never gains any thing by the &s;poils of the conquered party, yet pays all the expence. In the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms they &s;uffer as much as when they mi&s;carry; and peace becomes almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary after the greate&s;t victory, as when the enemy are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their frontier towns. This is almo&s;t always true. The exceptions are rare."</Q></P>
<P>Rou&s;&s;eau, in his project for a perpetual peace, confirms my principles; let us li&s;ten to this great writer. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If all princes are not yet cured of the folly of making conque&s;ts, it &s;eems at lea&s;t, that the wi&s;e&s;t of them begin to perceive that they &s;ometimes co&s;t more than they are worth. Without entering into di&s;tinctions that would lead us too far, it may be &s;aid in general, that a prince, who to extend his frontier lo&s;es as many of his ancient &s;ubjects as he gains of new ones, weakens him&s;elf by increa&s;ing his greatne&s;s; becau&s;e, with a greater territory to defend, he has no greater numbers to defend it. But it cannot be unknown that, in the way in which war is conducted at pre&s;ent, the lea&s;t part of the depopulation occa&s;ioned by it, is that which happens immediately in the field. That lo&s;s is indeed the mo&s;t apparent and &s;en&s;ible; but the lo&s;s, which the whole &s;tate &s;uffers at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="224" REF="242">
is more grievous and more irreparable than that of the men who peri&s;h; the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who are not born, the increa&s;e of taxes, the interruption of commerce, the de&s;ertion from the country, and the abandoning of agriculture. This is an evil not perceived at fir&s;t, but cruelly felt in its con&s;equences. We then wonder at finding our&s;elves &s;o weak, with &s;uch an apparent addition of &s;trength. What renders conque&s;ts le&s;s intere&s;ting is, that we now under&s;tand by what means power may be doubled and trebled, not only without extending our territory, but, as the Emperor Adrian did very wi&s;ely, &s;ome|times by contracting it. We know that men alone con&s;titute the &s;trength of kings. This propo&s;ition flows from what I have already &s;aid, that of two &s;tates, containing an equal number of inhabitants, that which occupies the &s;malle&s;t ter|ritory is in reality the &s;tronger. It is by good laws, by a wi&s;e police, and by great oeconomical views, that a judicious prince is &s;ure of increa&s;ing his &s;trength, without committing any thing to chance. The u&s;eful e&s;tabli&s;hments, which he forms in his own dominions, are the only real conque&s;ts made over his neighbours; every &s;ubject he acquires is an enemy de&s;troyed."</Q></P>
<P>The corollary re&s;ulting from the&s;e ob&s;ervations confirms my principles, and comes in aid of my &s;y&s;tem. The deva&s;tation of Bavaria, in 1743, affected the whole commerce of Europe. The ruin of &s;o many provinces in Germany, in the la&s;t war, will be felt for a con&s;iderable time. The powers concerned in the commerce with Poland perceive a gradual diminution of their profits from year to year. That kingdom, having nothing but corn to give in exchange for the many commodities &s;he wants, is impoveri&s;hed; the &s;ources of her commerce are exhau&s;ted. The&s;e ancient Salmatians will become &s;o much the more formi|dable. The poor nations of the north formerly plundered and
<PB N="225" REF="243">
conquered all Europe, and the ma&s;ters of Mexico and Peru have lo&s;t a con&s;iderable part of their dominions. European nations would be le&s;s to blame, if, in&s;tead of tearing one another to pieces, they turned their arms towards Africa. Tho&s;e barba|rous &s;tates perpetually in&s;ult us; to civili&s;e &s;uch barbarians, and to revive in Africa the times of the Carthaginians, of Syphax, and Ma&s;&s;ani&s;&s;a, might be attended with advantage. An object, &s;till more ea&s;y and le&s;s unju&s;t, would be to turn our views to America, not for acts of ho&s;tility, but for e&s;tabli&s;hments of commerce. In that quarter, the commercial powers have bu&s;i|ne&s;s enough to employ them for &s;ome ages. As we advance in making the Americans &s;en&s;ual and voluptuous, by means of good treatment, mildne&s;s, and humanity, their luxury will increa&s;e, and the commerce of Europe flouri&s;h in proportion. They would be kept in a &s;tate of dependence, and perhaps, in another point of view, made mi&s;erable by their improvement. But man mu&s;t have an object to occupy his ambition. To civili&s;e &s;avages by &s;ubduing them, &s;eems to be a good mixed with evil; which of the two preponderate, is a problem not ea&s;ily re&s;olved. Rou&s;&s;eau, the poet, tells us that in&s;tinct conducts the &s;avage, while rea&s;on leads us a&s;tray.</P>

<P>We all have the&s;e ver&s;es by heart, but the heart is not pene|trated with the truth of them. It is becau&s;e the factitious and artificial man is always at variance with man in his original and natural &s;tate. We are con&s;tantly &s;triving to exi&s;t out of our|&s;elves, and &s;eldom turn our thoughts inwards to reduce our&s;elves to our true dimen&s;ions. We depart from what we are, and lo&s;e the knowledge of our&s;elves for ever. What happens to an indi|vidual, happens to a nation. An European nation thinks that by increa&s;ing her wants, and by e&s;tabli&s;hing her&s;elf at the &s;ame moment in A&s;ia, Africa, and America, &s;he multiplies her being, and extends her exi&s;tence. From thence follow the contra|dictory conclu&s;ions of &s;peculation and experience, of theory and practice. Every thing belonging to man is a contradiction. The bi&s;hop of Cloyne, after enumerating the prodigious quan|tity of beef, pork, butter, and chee&s;e, exported every year from Ireland, a&s;ks, how a &s;tranger can conceive that half the inha|bitants &s;hould die of hunger in &s;o plentiful a country. It is one of the contradictions incident to human nature, and not to be otherwi&s;e accounted for. The tin mines of Cornwall are rich; the county it&s;elf is poor; becau&s;e the wealthy merchant, who works the mine, re&s;ides in London, not in the province. Our
<PB N="227" REF="245">
incon&s;iderate eagerne&s;s to be happy prevents us from being &s;o. This is a truth, which holds equally with re&s;pect to individuals, and with re&s;pect to nations. The powers of Europe would almo&s;t always find tho&s;e advantages in the pre&s;ervation of peace, which they vainly &s;eek for in war.</P>
<P>In our own times we &s;ee a contradiction &s;till more fatal. Almo&s;t all the princes, who reign at pre&s;ent, are inclined to peace, from motives of wi&s;dom and humanity; yet, by &s;ome unhappy fatality, have been often engaged in the mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive wars. It is to be wi&s;hed, that they may not recur &s;o fre|quently hereafter. They who think, &s;ays Voltaire, that kings and their mini&s;ters &s;acrifice every thing to their ambition ince&s;|&s;antly, and without mea&s;ure, are as much deceived as if they thought that kings and mini&s;ters &s;acrificed every thing to the happine&s;s of mankind. I do not know whether we may flatter our&s;elves, that mankind, as they grow older, may one day or other grow wi&s;er upon &s;ome &s;ubjects in which their happine&s;s and well-being are concerned. The art of war, &s;o generally under&s;tood, is carried to &s;uch a point, that almo&s;t every country is now &s;ecure from tho&s;e &s;udden inva&s;ions by which kingdoms are overturned. The expences of a campaign are become &s;o great, and the advantage to be drawn from &s;ucce&s;s &s;o incon&s;i|derable, owing to the re&s;ources which the enemy &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, even after a defeat, that the mo&s;t violent ambition is balanced by the counterpoi&s;e of avarice, or rather by the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting the continual expences of a war. A monarch, cotemporary with us, and not inferior to Alexander or to Cae&s;ar, has, like them, been obliged to exhau&s;t all the re&s;ources of military art and labor to pre&s;erve a province, the conque&s;t of which, under favor of certain circum&s;tances, was ea&s;y to him at fir&s;t. Yet even this &s;ucce&s;s is a phenomenon which a&s;toni&s;hes
<PB N="228" REF="246">
Europe. The expences, to which the Engli&s;h owe their great &s;ucce&s;&s;es, cannot be mentioned too often. This balance of Europe, purcha&s;ed with the blood of our ance&s;tors, is now &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that we need not for a long time dread a &s;upe|riority in any one power, &s;ufficient to di&s;turb the re&s;t of Europe. Commerce is become the apple of di&s;cord; yet, if we reflect, that peace is the element, and war the de&s;truction of trade, it is to be hoped, that we &s;hall be more circum&s;pect in departing from the one to engage in the other.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and intere&s;t concur with our increa&s;ing inability to &s;upport continued wars. In former times, war was &s;upported by annual taxes equal to the expence of it. This at pre&s;ent is impo&s;&s;ible. One time or other it will be felt, that to aggrandi&s;e a kingdom, or the territory of a kingdom, is not increa&s;ing the power of the prince, which con&s;i&s;ts in a great number of &s;ub|jects &s;ub&s;i&s;ting at their ea&s;e. Experience &s;hows what re&s;ources an enemy may di&s;cover after the &s;evere&s;t lo&s;&s;es. It is only beginning again upon a new account. The famine in 1709, and the general ruin of France, &s;upplied Lewis XIV. with a fatal re&s;ource, but an u&s;eful one for the moment. As the country remained uncultivated, the poverty of the people facilitated the levy of recruits, &s;o that France brought armies into the field more numerous than her enemies, who were always &s;ucce&s;sful. She gained time, and was &s;aved by accidents that always happen when we have time to wait for them. But, a&s;&s;uredly, no monarch would willingly expo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;uch a cri&s;is, though it be in the order of events. In our own times we have &s;een more than one &s;ketch of this picture. In a word, it is po&s;&s;ible, that the general knowledge which every day enlightens the world, that humanity, experience, and wi&s;dom, concurring with intere&s;t and nece&s;&s;ity, may in time e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;olid and durable
<PB N="229" REF="247">
peace in Europe, and &s;ecure the happine&s;s of mankind. In this point the wi&s;hes of every rea&s;onable and humane per&s;on &s;hould unite. Their wit, their intere&s;t, and their knowledge, &s;hould all be exerted to in&s;pire others with the &s;ame &s;entiments, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>There is &s;till &s;omething to be &s;aid in favor of the Engli&s;h, whom, according to this &s;y&s;tem, I may be accu&s;ed of depre&s;&s;ing too much. No, Sir, I am a citizen of the world; not cold and indifferent, but zealous, and humane. I love all nations, be|cau&s;e in all nations there are men who de&s;erve to be beloved, and they all belong to human kind. I behold every national enmity with horror, becau&s;e nothing is &s;o unju&s;t. I am pleading the cau&s;e of humanity. I affirm, that the Engli&s;h nation, now at the height of their glory, (if, by a wi&s;e admini&s;tration, they make a proper u&s;e of it) have need of great precautions to guard their independence. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould be jealous of advantages, which we all agree are precarious. France, by her extent, the number of her inhabitants, the goodne&s;s of her &s;oil, the frugality and indu&s;try of her people, and by her &s;ituation, mu&s;t always be a powerful kingdom, even without an exten&s;ive commerce, or without colonies. Her va&s;t, compact dominion, and her double frontiers, are a &s;ecurity again&s;t a &s;udden inva&s;ion. But England, by her phy&s;ical po&s;ition, having nothing to depend upon but her wooden walls, and the &s;u|periority of her commerce, &s;hould endeavour to pre&s;erve an advantage, in point of marine, over a power which, in every other article, carries it again&s;t her. The Engli&s;h are not alarmed without rea&s;on; their fears are not quite imaginary; and here lies the fatal point which alone can di&s;turb that fortunate har|mony and proportion, which I wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h for the happine&s;s of Europe, of human nature, and of two nations the mo&s;t
<PB N="230" REF="248">
powerful in the univer&s;e, and the mo&s;t de&s;erving of e&s;teem. To find this ju&s;t combination, to unfold this ill-dige&s;ted ma&s;s of propo&s;itions, which I &s;et forth with confidence, even in their pre&s;ent &s;hapele&s;s &s;tate, is a ta&s;k, in which every hone&s;t man is invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>There are Engli&s;hmen who pretend to &s;ay, that, if it had not been for the preparations made in France in 1751 and 1752, and for the augmentation of the French marine, war would not have been declared, and that the differences in A&s;ia and America would have been amicably adju&s;ted; that they had every rea&s;on to dread their own de&s;truction, if they had waited until the French marine had arrived at a &s;tate of con&s;i&s;tency; that their &s;ecurity and pre&s;ervation obliged them to prevent it. I &s;hall not examine into the validity of this rea&s;oning; but no good citizen can con&s;ider the con&s;equences of it, without &s;eeing how much it concerns humanity to obviate them for the future. France has an equal right to maintain a re&s;pectable marine for the defence of her colonies. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them is precarious without it. France however &s;eems to have no other occa&s;ion for a marine but to pre&s;erve an important acce&s;&s;ory; whereas it is e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of England. Since all the powers of Europe a&s;pire to the advantages of commerce, I conjure them to con&s;ider how much the long peace, which &s;ucceeded the war occa&s;ioned by the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was beneficial to them all, and how prejudicial war has been to population, and to various branches of commerce, even in that nation, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;&s;es have di&s;covered to her the &s;ecret of her &s;trength. If prodigious &s;ucce&s;&s;es are &s;carce &s;ufficient to compen&s;ate the mi&s;chief done by war, why &s;hould we &s;o often run the ri&s;que of it? Of the three &s;courges to which nature has expo&s;ed us, war is the only one that providence has left in our own hands, and it recurs the

But I am per&s;uaded that, if friend&s;hip and confidence could be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the foundation of mutual intere&s;t and convenience well under&s;tood, and demon&s;trated in conformity to my prin|ciples, it would not be impo&s;&s;ible to find the point in que&s;tion, yet without fixing any po&s;itive and determinate rule about it. It cannot be denied, that a formidable marine is nece&s;&s;ary to a great i&s;land, which has no other defence but her fleet again&s;t an inva&s;ion; that it is nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of colonies, and di&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and even to &s;ucceed in the expen&s;ive conque&s;t of the di&s;tant colonies of other powers, who have a weak or inferior marine. It is in this &s;en&s;e only, that they, who are ma&s;ters at &s;ea, can now be &s;aid to be ma&s;ters at land; and that

<P>Since each &s;tate is di&s;tingui&s;hed from every other by local &s;ituation, extent, climate, &s;oil, religion, external relations, and by the nature of its government, it follows, that each &s;tate mu&s;t have a different political con&s;titution. The marine of the Athe|nians, Carthaginians, and Romans, (ab&s;tracted from com|merce, which was then in its infancy) and con&s;idered only as con&s;tituting the naval power of the &s;tate, was of a different nature from ours. At that time the rival fleets always &s;ought an engagement; at pre&s;ent they frequently endeavour to avoid one. <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">The author would be puzzled to name an in&s;tance of a Briti&s;h fleet, or any part of it, having avoided an engagement.

A battle or two at land had the &s;ame effect. At pre&s;ent every frontier is bordered with fortre&s;&s;es. The conqueror is obliged to &s;top at every &s;tep he takes. Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Marlborough, Villars, Eugene, and Mar&s;hal Saxe, have gained more victories than Alexander and Cae&s;ar; yet the conque&s;ts of our modern heroes bear no proportion to tho&s;e of the ancient. If the cau&s;es of the&s;e great and a&s;toni&s;hing changes be thoroughly examined, diver&s;ity of circum&s;tances will &s;how us the nece&s;&s;ity of departing from &s;ome of our political maxims, that &s;eem the mo&s;t funda|mental. When the means are no longer proportioned to the
<PB N="233" REF="251">
effect they ought to produce, they &s;hould be improved, cor|rected, or abandoned.</P>
<P>To judge how little a maritime force in Europe contributes to conque&s;ts upon terra firma, let us ob&s;erve the &s;ucce&s;s of our great armaments in the la&s;t ages. Setting a&s;ide the invin|cible armada of Philip II. let us come nearer to our own times. Have the powerful and numerous fleets of England, France, and Holland, ever produced an effect proportioned to their &s;trength, or to the enormous expence of equipping them? Have not the Engli&s;h, in the la&s;t war, mi&s;carried on the coa&s;ts of France? Was Lewis XIV. with a formidable marine, even able to conquer Ireland, where king James had a party that favored his de&s;igns? Formerly the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, with inferior forces, conquered England. If the time, foretold by the prophet, of <HI>a new heaven and a new earth,</HI> be not yet arrived, we mu&s;t agree that the form at lea&s;t is altered in every thing that regards the military. In this in|&s;tance we have a new world, widely different from the ancient. The invention of gunpowder, the art of engineering, the &s;tudies of Vauban and Coehorn, the &s;cience of marches brought to perfection by Turenne, by Cond&eacute;, and Montecuculi, have pro|longed and multiplied the re&s;ources of defence. Experience proves that the great actions performed by Ruiter, Du Que&s;ne, and Blake, were fitter to excite admiration, than to procure any &s;olid advantages. It is in the di&s;tant conque&s;ts of i&s;lands and colonies that the Engli&s;h have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, and met with prodigious &s;ucce&s;s. General engagements at &s;ea are almo&s;t entirely given up; boarding is out of the que&s;tion; and I much doubt whether, in France at lea&s;t, the advantages to be expected from great naval armaments are in any degree an&s;wer|able to the enormous expence of them. I do not mean that the marine &s;hould be entirely neglected; I only wi&s;h that the
<PB N="234" REF="252">
degree, to which it may be u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary, as well as the time and means of forming it, were carefully con&s;idered. I wi&s;h that a compari&s;on were made between real and imaginary lo&s;&s;es, between what is &s;aved by the marine, and what it co&s;ts; that it &s;hould be calculated what naval force is nece&s;&s;ary to a power, which, in time of peace, maintains two hundred thou|&s;and men; whether the maintenance of a marine, equally formidable, may not &s;afely be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and whether the immen&s;e expences of this &s;ervice might not be employed to greater advantage in other branches of admini&s;tration; and that the e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction between this nation, and tho&s;e which are called <HI>maritime powers,</HI> &s;hould be thoroughly under&s;tood, in order that the apprehen&s;ion of future danger may not expo&s;e to immediate di&s;a&s;ters. I know that I am attacking a received principle, an univer&s;al prejudice; and yet I wi&s;h that, once for all, it might be &s;eriou&s;ly enquired, whether the kingdom of France might not find a &s;ource of riches more &s;olid, and le&s;s precarious, within her own bo&s;om, in her &s;oil, in her entrails, and in the labor and increa&s;e of her inhabitants, than tho&s;e which are &s;ought after at a di&s;tance, with &s;o much toil, danger, and expence; and whether too great a navigation, as well as too many colonies upon di&s;tant continents, be not contrary to the con&s;titution, and injurious to a country, in which there are already &s;o many cau&s;es of depopulation, &s;o much luxury, and &s;o many per&s;ons in a &s;tate of celibacy. Every &s;ort of commerce is not equally fit for every country. One branch of commerce may enrich individuals, and be prejudicial to the &s;tate; or it may &s;uit one nation, and be dangerous for another.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t brilliant branch of commerce frequently co&s;ts more blood and trea&s;ure to pre&s;erve it by a war, than it pays for by its returns during the ce&s;&s;ation of arms. Peace, unhappily, is in general only the interval in which open ho&s;tilities &s;ub&s;ide, in
<PB N="235" REF="253">
order to begin again with greater vigor. Every age has its &s;y&s;tem of politics, as well as philo&s;ophy. The new di&s;coveries in A&s;ia and America &s;ucceeded to the cru&s;ades; then came the wars of religion; and afterwards the pretended &s;y&s;tem of equi|librium, or balance of power. For &s;ome time pa&s;t, nothing has been thought of but commerce, navigation, and marine. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Lewis XIV. happened before the great marine was formed. It never can be e&s;tabli&s;hed but at the expence of the land forces; &s;o true it is, that we cannot &s;erve two ma&s;ters at a time. The progre&s;s which a collection of fi&s;hermen have made, by means of commerce and their India company, has dazzled Europe, and turned the eyes of every body towards trade. But let it be con&s;idered that circum&s;tances are very different from what they were; the &s;ituation of this people in a country overflowed by the &s;ea, the nece&s;&s;ity of making &s;ome advantage of an element which threatens them ince&s;&s;antly, the impo&s;&s;ibility of doing better, and their laborious oeconomy, have enriched them in a commerce which was a long time exclu&s;ive. But things have greatly altered &s;ince other nations have &s;hared in the profits; the ma&s;s of wealth has lo&s;t in depth what it has gained in &s;urface.</P>
<P>France, within her own bo&s;om, has a lucrative and &s;uperior commerce, which nothing can affect, as long as the price of labor is lower than in any other nation. The ta&s;te and frugality of her arti&s;ans is an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource for the conception of new manufactures, the contrivance of precious trifles, &s;tudied conveniences, and fa&s;hions of every &s;ort. All Europe is fond of French fa&s;hions; and Fa&s;hion, that fickle daughter of Levity and Caprice, governs and exacts a tribute from all other nations, while &s;he &s;ubmits to the dominion of France. The vineyards are a real Peru to that country. The cod fi&s;hery is an important
<PB N="236" REF="254">
object, not &s;o much as a nur&s;ery for &s;eamen, as becau&s;e it is it&s;elf a nutritive art. But, in &s;uch a country as France, agri|culture and manufactures &s;hould be the fir&s;t &s;pring in a wi&s;e admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>One cannot pay too great an attention to a truth which I have heretofore &s;o often endeavoured to inculcate, viz. that one, and perhaps the principal cau&s;e of the increa&s;ed greatne&s;s of the Engli&s;h power, is the care they have taken to forward the cultivation of their lands. Corn has been a new mine, to which government, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, &s;acrificed &s;ome fallacious duties. The bounty upon exportation has been the &s;upport of agriculture. By giving money to the farmer to export his corn, all the &s;oil has been brought into improvement; and this has &s;upported the power of the nation. If half the trea&s;ure, which a &s;tate is often obliged to lavi&s;h upon her marine, or in a war that might be deferred, were employed upon this object, it would, in ten years, produce wherewithal to form and maintain a marine upon &s;olid principles. Upon the whole, I conclude that commercial powers would do infinitely better to leave the deci&s;ion of their differences, whenever differences unfortunately ari&s;e, to the event of a &s;ort of lottery, than to the fate of arms. War, at all times dreadful, in general offers us nothing but a fatal alternative between humiliating misfortunes and expen&s;ive &s;ucce&s;&s;es. It was no exaggeration to affirm, that all the vices of every age, and every country, do not equal the evils produced by a &s;ingle campaign; and that war is a crime, which includes all other crimes. It is a de&s;tructive madne&s;s, which makes the earth the habitation of robbers, one va&s;t and horrible &s;epulchre.</P>
<P>The con&s;equences to be drawn from all the&s;e vague reflections and principles might perhaps lead us to di&s;cover the middle term, at which the marine of one nation may be con&s;iderable
<PB N="237" REF="255">
enough to defend her commerce and her colonies, yet without giving umbrage to another. Pre&s;ervation and defence do not require &s;o powerful an effort. When once we bani&s;h the idea of ho&s;tile projects, great expence and labor may be &s;pared on both &s;ides, yet without departing from their reciprocal pro|portion. An intimate alliance with the commercial powers, a &s;olemn and mutual guarantee of colonies, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and com|mercial privileges, founded upon common intere&s;t and the general good, might e&s;tabli&s;h confidence, and erect a new &s;y&s;tem, which would be the happine&s;s of mankind, and the glory of the age. The&s;e powers acting always in concert, and with good faith to each other, might contribute to appea&s;e, or prevent a rupture among the re&s;t. Twenty years peace would be &s;ufficient to make every nation happy.</P>
<P>When the pre&s;ent picture of Europe &s;hall be well under&s;tood, every power may find its pre&s;ervation and pro&s;perity therein, provided they do not thwart each other for imaginary intere&s;ts. Every commercial power has employment for at lea&s;t twenty years, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h and improve its internal admini&s;tration, and that commerce which lies within the &s;phere of its &s;trength. Until all the&s;e objects are accompli&s;hed, and every po&s;&s;ible advantage made of them, di&s;tant objects, which by their ex|tent go beyond the &s;phere of &s;trength, are foreign and hurt|ful to commerce, and to the real intere&s;t of nations; this is a truth demon&s;trated by the event of almo&s;t all our wars. We &s;hould never engage in ho&s;tilities, if attention were paid to &s;o many important objects, which cannot be thought of but in a profound and continued peace. I &s;hall mark briefly what the&s;e objects are, as a &s;hort recapitulation of the whole.</P>
<P>It is only in peace that a good admini&s;tration can protect the provinces wa&s;ted to &s;upport the opulence of the capital. The

more the head enlarges, beyond its proportion with the limbs, &s;o much the more does the body politic repre&s;ent the infancy of the natural body, and the feeblene&s;s of that age.</P>
<P>Agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, may re&s;tore a proportion, now lo&s;t, between the head and the limbs. They, who reproach Colbert with having protected manufactures too much, did not attend to the turn of the age. Since luxury is become a nece&s;&s;ary or unavoidable evil, every po&s;&s;ible advantage mu&s;t be made of it. We mu&s;t weigh and con&s;ider circum|&s;tances as they exi&s;t, without regarding po&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;itions. It is agreed, that manufactures are of a tran&s;itory precarious nature, and liable to be removed by any trifling event. For this rea&s;on, in my political picture, I give them but the &s;econd rank after agriculture, which holds the fir&s;t in the oeconomical order of the &s;tate. It is not of a peri&s;hable quality, &s;ince it furni&s;hes the fir&s;t materials, and belongs to nature, and to the &s;oil. But arts and trades follow clo&s;e upon agriculture. We may, if we plea&s;e, con&s;ider manufactures as the remedy of an evil; but the evil exi&s;ts, and would be mortal without the remedy. External commerce with our neighbours &s;ucceeds to manufactures; and next to this follows the eccentric or di&s;tant commerce of colo|nies, which is only nece&s;&s;ary when a too great abundance of people, and a &s;uperfluity of productions, require an outlet, and when they bring back a plentiful return, which may be exported to foreigners, and procure a new &s;ource of fertility to the &s;tate. All the unnece&s;&s;ary wars, undertaken for this di&s;tant object, have been made at the expence of objects more important, more immediately urgent, more u&s;eful, nece&s;&s;ary, and ea&s;y, and which nothing but a continued peace could bring to perfection. When France and England &s;hall have brought all their &s;oil into improvement, when all their provinces &s;hall have arrived at the

highe&s;t degree of population that their territory allows of, when a circulation and political proportion &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed between the capital and the provinces, when the theory of taxation &s;hall have fixed an exact equilibrium between the &s;ervices and the means, when manufactures &s;hall have found every po&s;&s;ible internal and external channel of &s;upplying the nation, the foreigner, and the colonies which the&s;e two nations po&s;&s;e&s;s at pre&s;ent&mdash;when all the&s;e objects are accompli&s;hed, that will be the period, at which it may become a que&s;tion&mdash;Whether new preten&s;ions can be advantageous to either of them? But to arrive at this point, would require a peace of fifty years conti|nuance at lea&s;t. Nothing appears to me more evident than the&s;e principles. They re&s;t upon proofs, which I defy any man to invalidate. Enough has been &s;aid for tho&s;e who are willing to under&s;tand me; too much perhaps for tho&s;e who are determined never to adopt &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem. It cannot however be condemned, &s;ince every part of it breathes humanity and the public welfare. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>(7.) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"L'Angleterre e&s;t unie avec le Portugal par des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts mutuels.

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The union of Great Britain and Portugal is undoubtedly founded on their mutual intere&s;t. It would probably have been &s;tricter and more cordial than it has been, if the intere&s;ts, on which it was originally founded, and which mu&s;t be the &s;upport of it as long as it la&s;ts, had been better under&s;tood by both nations, or a little more re&s;olutely maintained by one of them. Our affairs in Portugal could hardly have taken the unfavorable turn they have done of late years, if there had been either true wi&s;dom in the councils of Portugal, or a greater degree of firmne&s;s in tho&s;e of Great Britain. I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of facts, to know whether this be a &s;ubject any longer intere&s;ting to the public. If it be, it may receive &s;ome light from an opinion, that mediates between the merchant and the mini&s;ter. If merchants have been too apt to urge their complaints with violence and a&s;perity, mini&s;ters have been equally ready to conclude that they complained without rea&s;on. So ea&s;y a conclu&s;ion gave facility to bu&s;ine&s;s, and le&s;&s;ened the burthen of office. The great mi&s;|take with re&s;pect to the union of England and Portugal, and which &s;eems to have hitherto governed the argument, is, that it is founded in an equal and reciprocal conce&s;&s;ion of commercial advantages. It is an undoubted truth, though not readily admitted by Portugal, that Great Britain and Ireland are the only nations, with which Portugal can trade to advantage. No other nations take off their wines and fruit in the quantity that we do. But this is a benefit ari&s;ing from the favorable turn their trade has taken, and from the indulgence of this country, not from the form or &s;pirit of treaties. Compared, as a fact, with the true principle of union between the two nations, it improves and enforces the national argument again&s;t Portugal. The le&s;s we owe them in the &s;cale of com|merce, &s;o much the more it will be found they are our debtors in the political balance. The principle they now contend for, that commercial equality is the ba&s;is of the alliance, if once admitted on our part, or not firmly denied, mu&s;t open an endle&s;s field for negotiation with a court, one of who&s;e principal re&s;ources, to maintain its dignity, confi&s;ts in negotiation. I am far from meaning to lower the importance of a crown re&s;pectable in it&s;elf, and rai&s;ed by its alliance with this country. But it is time that &s;ome regard &s;hould be paid to truth, as well as to ceremony, and that we &s;hould no longer be diverted, by forms, from the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts. A Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the true meaning and &s;pirit of our treaties with Portugal, who does not con&s;ider the &s;cope of tho&s;e treaties in a general view, will find it difficult to an&s;wer the court of Portugal, when they ju&s;tify the breach of particular &s;tipulations in our favor, by alledging &s;ome general declarations of equality of privileges, which are to be found in all the treaties; and when they conclude from thence, that our claim is no farther valid than as we, in our turn, admit theirs to be equal to it. Upon the idea that commercial intere&s;ts only are the ba&s;is of the alliance, their argument would be unan&s;werable. If nothing but an apparent equality of commercial privi|leges had been in contemplation, there could be no rea&s;on why we &s;hould be allowed a judge con&s;ervator at Li&s;bon, or a right (hitherto not exerci&s;ed) of employing our own factors in their American &s;ettlements, unle&s;s we allowed the Portugue&s;e the &s;ame privileges in return. It is not to be conceived that Portugal would have &s;ub|mitted to &s;uch conditions, without receiving an equivalent in &s;ome &s;hape or other. The que&s;tion then remains, Of what nature was the equivalent intended to be? If equal compen&s;ations of a commercial nature were intended, why were they not &s;pecifically &s;tipulated, or why have they never been formally demanded? The u&s;e the court of Portugal make of their newly-a&s;&s;umed principle is, to defend their inva&s;ion of <HI>our</HI> privileges, not to a&s;&s;ert any commercial claims of their own. If it were better founded than it is, or if, by common con&s;ent, the connection between the two countries were reduced to mere commercial in|tercour&s;e, without any particular claim to pre&s;erence or favor on either &s;ide, and without any tacit or &s;pecific terms of alliance or political engagements what|&s;oever; I believe it would be found that this nation, as things are now &s;ituated, would be no lo&s;er by the agreement. We might then open the wine trade with France on terms of infinitely greater advantage to this country than any that ari&s;es from the fale of our woollen goods in Portugal, which only maintain their ground there from their &s;uperior quality and cheapne&s;s, not from any favor on the part of the Portugue&s;e government, who, contrary to an expre&s;s &s;tipulation, for which we give them an equivalent, have, till very lately, admitted French woollen goods, as readily as ours. We &s;hould not then be called upon, particularly and &s;ingly, to bear the burthen of protecting a nation, incapable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting us if we wanted her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and from which we receive no preference in point of trade, the only way in which it is po&s;&s;ible for them to offer us a compen&s;ation. We &s;hould cea&s;e to think our&s;elves bound by an obligation, after the condition of it was withdrawn. The original and only rational principle of union between the two nations, is, that great commercial advantages, yielded on one &s;ide, &s;hall be the compen&s;ation for national protection on the other. This may be a topic ungrateful and offen&s;ive to the ears of a Portugue&s;e mini&s;ter, therefore unfit to be urged in every petty difference or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion that may occur between the two courts; but it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted upon and admitted, once for all, as the ba&s;is of all negotiation between them, and the only foundation of their alliance. If the advantages we once enjoyed in Portugal are withdrawn, if the nature of the commerce be altered, or if it be the policy of the court of Portugal to lay their trade open to all the nations of Europe indifferently; it follows, that Portugal puts nothing in the &s;cale to balance the expence and hazard at which England con&s;tantly engages in her defence, and that whatever intere&s;t this country has in maintaining the independence of the crown of Portugal is only an intere&s;t common to us with the other trading nations of Europe, who all trade to Portugal upon the &s;ame, if not better terms than we do. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport &s;o plain and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate an argument, by a detail of grievances repeatedly &s;et forth by the merchants, or by in&s;i&s;ting upon in&s;tances of particular enmity, apparent in the councils of Portugal, again&s;t the Briti&s;h nation. A great part of it may have ari&s;en from per&s;onal ill-will, or want of wi&s;dom, in the reigning mini&s;ter, and perhaps may cea&s;e with his admini&s;tration. The re&s;t is only a mean, ill-founded jealou&s;y, ari&s;ing from a total ignorance of the true principles of commerce, and which could not exi&s;t in a more enlightened court. They are yet to learn, that it is the indu&s;try of the other European nations, which brings the gold into Portugal; and that, if it were not for the manufactures of tho&s;e nations, which produce this &s;plendid return from the Brazils, they them&s;elves would lo&s;e even the tran&s;itory benefit of its pa&s;&s;age through Portugal. But without de&s;cending to engage in ill-tempered and u&s;ele&s;s altercations, without entertaining the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of ho&s;tility again&s;t Portugal, it is but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable that the councils of England &s;hould no longer be governed by principles, which cea&s;e to be motives of conduct, when they cea&s;e to corre&s;pond with the actual &s;tate of facts. If the &s;y&s;tem of trade between the two countries be totally altered, and if there be no likelihood of recovering the advantages we have lo&s;t, it follows that a new &s;y&s;tem of policy al&s;o &s;hould be adopted for the future. The independence of the crown of Portugal is not now an object of particular moment to Great Britain. If it &s;hould be attacked hereafter, it may perhaps be thought advi&s;able to contribute &s;omething to its defence. But common &s;en&s;e and &s;ound policy require that our contribution &s;hould be proportioned to our real intere&s;t in the object, and that Holland, Ger|many, Denmark, Sweden, and France, &s;hould be called upon to take a &s;hare in the burthen. The con&s;equence of adhering firmly to this &s;imple and rational &s;y&s;tem of conduct would be, that Portugal, in the moment of danger, would find her&s;elf de&s;erted by every other &s;tate, and have no re&s;ource left, but in the &s;ingle arm of Great Britain. We &s;hould then have an opportunity of in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;ome rea&s;onable equivalent for the expence and hazard, in which the defence of her cau&s;e might involve us, and of &s;howing a court, which pre&s;umes upon our forbearance, that Oliver Cromwell and Charles II. have not left us a wi&s;e example to no purpo&s;e. It is not many years &s;ince &s;uch an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and was unaccountably neglected; but ere long it cannot fail of occurring to us again.</P>
<P>Having imputed the oppre&s;&s;ion of our merchants, and the ruin of our trade with Portugal, in a great mea&s;ure, to want of wi&s;dom in the reigning mini&s;ter, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify that opinion. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay what idea the Portugue&s;e them&s;elves may entertain of the rate and extent of his abilities. They have but few opportunities of expre&s;&s;ing their &s;entiments with freedom, and perhaps their ab&s;tract information may not reach far enough to judge of the wi&s;dom of political or com|mercial mea&s;ures, but as they feel them&s;elves affected by the con&s;equences. Their general dete&s;tation of his per&s;on and government concludes only again&s;t that part of the human character, on which he places the lowe&s;t value, not immediately again&s;t his under&s;tanding. In England it is the general turn to con&s;ider him as a mini&s;ter per&s;onally and politically ho&s;tile to the intere&s;ts of this country, but in other re&s;pects active, &s;agacious, and intrepid. No man has yet been hardy enough to que&s;tion his abilities; much le&s;s to pronounce upon evidence, that he is defective in every quality that con&s;titutes a clear, &s;olid, &s;uperior under&s;tanding. To &s;tate this matter impartially, may be of importance to both nations. Though his own life cannot la&s;t long, his &s;y&s;tem of commerce and politics may exi&s;t after him. His long influence over the councils of Portugal has given a bia&s;s to the ideas of that court, which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may not have judgment or re&s;olution enough to correct. The opinion of his great &s;uperiority, impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind of his royal ma&s;ter, and of a &s;ubordinate council compo&s;ed of his own pupils, may perpetuate the plan of his admini&s;tration. If this opinion can be &s;haken, or removed; if it can be made evident that he is, in no &s;hape, qualified to conduct the affairs of a nation; it will not follow that he can be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the confidence of his &s;overeign; but it may produce this happy effect, that his authority may not extend beyond the period of his power, and that the &s;y&s;tem of his policy may be &s;uffered to peri&s;h with him. When we &s;ee a mini&s;ter for twenty years together inve&s;ted with unlimited power, meeting with no controul what&s;oever, dome&s;tic or external, profe&s;&s;ing to have the intere&s;ts of his country at heart, and perpetually occupied in one project or other, with infinite indu&s;try and per&s;everance, it &s;eems natural to a&s;k, <HI>What good has he done?</HI> Are agriculture and manufactures upon a better footing in Portugal than when he fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the reins of government? Has he recovered commerce from a langui&s;hing &s;tate, and is he likely to leave it in a flouri&s;hing condition? Has he &s;ecured the independence of the defencele&s;s crown of Portugal, by confirming ancient alliances, or contracting new ones? In &s;hort, are the people richer and happier than he found them? The an&s;wer which every man, acquainted with the &s;tate of Portugal, makes to the&s;e que&s;tions, is a direct negative, and the conclu&s;ion again&s;t his abilities is impo&s;&s;ible to be evaded. They who in&s;i&s;t warmly upon his zeal however un&s;ucce&s;sful, and urge the rectitude of his intentions however unhappily di&s;appointed, forget they are deciding &s;everely again&s;t his under&s;tanding. It is not in fortune, con&s;tantly to defeat a mini&s;ter, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ab&s;olute power, and uniformly employs it in the &s;upport of wi&s;e and judicious mea&s;ures. His pretended zeal for the improvement of agriculture, and increa&s;e of population, produced the exclu&s;ive wine company which monopoli&s;es the chief produce of the &s;oil. The &s;ilk manufacture at Li&s;bon, undertaken in the la&s;t reign at a great expence, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by prohibitions, and &s;up|ported by all the influence of the court, has langui&s;hed under his care, and is actually in a &s;tate of decay. The other manufactures may contribute a little to the &s;upply of the lower ranks in the internal con&s;umption of the kingdom; but neither are they objects of importance, nor do they owe any thing to his encou|ragement. The trade of Portugal was in as pro&s;perous a &s;tate, as that of any country can be, which has not produce enough of its own to an&s;wer the demand of great and populous colonies. The colonies, it is true, were chiefly &s;upplied by the indu&s;try of other nations, who only performed an office which the re&s;ources of the mother country were not equal to. But Portugal was the mart of trade, and centre of communication. In&s;tead of vainly attempting to detain the gold in the country, &s;ometimes by tricks and contrivances, &s;ometimes by fraud and violence, the object of Portugal &s;hould have been to encourage a large importation into the colonies, by which her own navigation mu&s;t of cour&s;e be extended, and by making the mother country profit, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by an immen&s;e and rapid circula|tion. All the commercial ideas of the mini&s;ter are founded upon one general maxim, that trade, in order to be pro&s;perous, &s;hould not be free. Accordingly, he has heaped project upon project, and regulation upon regulation; and de&s;troyed a healthy con&s;titution, by confining it to a &s;ickly regimen, and by loading it with pre&s;criptions. He has made it his &s;tudy to di&s;tre&s;s foreign merchants, and to drive them out of the kingdom. He has put the vineyards and their produce, the only in|ternal &s;ource of wealth to Portugal, under the check and controul of a monopoly; and he has confined a con&s;iderable part of the Brazil trade to two exclu&s;ive compa|nies, the principle and &s;pirit of which is, to make the greate&s;t profits upon the &s;malle&s;t out&s;et or venture. If the Pernambucco and Maranham companies had &s;ucceeded, it was his intention to have taken the &s;ame care of the Bahia and Rio trade. But the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;criptions were completed with &s;o much difficulty, that it would have been in vain to attempt new ones. One would think that he meant to contract the commerce of his country, and to &s;tifle indu&s;try at its birth. The event has corre&s;ponded with the de&s;ign. In the year 1759, the fleet from Pernambucco con&s;i&s;ted of forty-five &s;hips. In the year 1772, the trade to that &s;ettlement em|ployed only eighteen. To &s;upport the credit of the new companies, he thought it advi&s;able <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the royal edict of the 21&s;t of June, 1766, it is a&s;&s;erted, that to refu&s;e the actions of a trading company, as &s;o much ready money, is contrary to the univer&s;al practice of all the com|mercial nations of Europe, <HI>oppo&s;ta &agrave; pratica univer&s;al do commercio de toda a Europa;</HI> and the mini&s;ter was ignorant enough to imagine, that the authority of government in Portugal would produce the &s;ame effect that credit does in other countries. He was ignorant enough not to know, that the interpo&s;ition of arbitrary power in matters of trade and property de&s;troys all credit and confidence among men. The decree has &s;ince been repealed.</NOTE> to i&s;&s;ue an edict, which ordered that their actions &s;hould be a legal tender, and be accepted, at an arbitrary valuation fixed by the directors, as &s;o much &s;pecie; that is, in other words, that the natives, who are con&s;tantly the debtors, &s;hould remove the burthen from them&s;elves, and impo&s;e it upon their foreign creditors. This, however, was an attempt too extravagant to be &s;upported. Such are the general plans, and &s;uch the temporary expedients, from which we are to collect an opinion of the mini&s;ter's capacity. The facts I re&s;er to are notorious. In a country, where the true principles of trade are under&s;tood, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to prove that, in theory, no better con&s;equences were to be expected from a &s;y&s;tem &s;o fal&s;e and anti-commercial. The Portugue&s;e mu&s;t be taught by experience.</P>
<P>To form a judgment of his political mea&s;ures, we &s;hould compare the defence|le&s;s &s;tate of Portugal with the general plan of ambition of the united hou&s;e of Bourbon, and the particular claims and enmity of the crown of Spain. The inde|pendence of Portugal can only be maintained by cultivating the friend&s;hip of the other powers of Europe, particularly by confirming the ancient alliance with the only nation that ever has, or ever can engage effectually in her defence. The&s;e are e&s;&s;ential objects, not to be compared with any temporary advantages, and from which a wi&s;e mini&s;ter will not &s;uffer his attention to be diverted. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay how little they have been regarded in the political &s;y&s;tem of the Mar|quis of Pombal. Upon the whole, it mu&s;t be admitted, that the proofs of his mini&s;terial abilities are of an extraordinary nature. His commercial experience and information have led him to divide the trade of his country into monopolies. His policy has taught him to provoke the natural enemies, and to alienate the natu|ral allies, of the crown. His two &s;y&s;tems corre&s;pond and co-operate with each other. In con&s;equence of receiving all foreigners upon the &s;ame footing in Portu|gal, and of laying all foreign trade under equal re&s;traint, it cea&s;es to be a great natural intere&s;t to any one nation to maintain the independence of the kingdom. A union of inferior &s;tates, in favor of a court with whom they have no &s;olid foun|dation of alliance, is not to be expected, nor would it be effectual. His country then, with a &s;mall internal force, and de&s;titute of all alliance, is left expo&s;ed to the inva&s;ion of a &s;uperior enemy, who&s;e claims are not ob&s;olete, and who do not always wait for ju&s;t or decent pretences to act again&s;t Portugal; nor is there a power in Europe, to which his Mo&s;t Faithful Maje&s;ty can &s;ay with truth, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is <HI>your</HI> intere&s;t to protect me."</Q></P>
<P>The la&s;t que&s;tion to be con&s;idered is, Whether he has made the Portugue&s;e a richer or a happier people than he found them? If he has, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the means he makes u&s;e of would hardly have produced that effect in any other country. If he has not, his maxim, <HI>that &s;overeigns are not to be re&s;trained by treaties from con&s;ulting the internal welfare of their &s;ubjects,</HI> leaves him without the po&s;&s;ibility of a defence. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Greater powers than Portugal have thought it no diminution of their &s;overeignty to &s;ubmit to &s;pecial re&s;traints of this kind, for the &s;ake of other advantages. By the commercial treaties between France and Holland, each party is expre&s;sly re&s;trained from granting new privileges to their own &s;ubjects, to the prejudice of the other, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ans qu'il &s;oit permis &agrave; l'un ou &agrave; l'autre de conceder, ou de faire &agrave; leurs &s;ujets des immunit&eacute;s, benefices, dons gratuits, ou autres avantages, par de&s;&s;us ceux de l'autre, ou &agrave; leur prejudice."</Q></NOTE> If the mea&s;ures, which he calls expedient, fail of &s;ucce&s;s, he is precluded from pleading any ob&s;tructions that might ari&s;e from the engage|ments of the crown with foreign nations. The conclu&s;ion reverts, with accumu|lated force, again&s;t the wi&s;dom and mildne&s;s of his admini&s;tration. Hitherto it has been only marked by the blood of the principal nobility, and uni|ver&s;al oppre&s;&s;ion of the people. There can be no increa&s;e of wealth in a coun|try where indu&s;try is effectually di&s;couraged, and no man's property &s;ecure. There can be no dome&s;tic content or happine&s;s among a people, one half of which are &s;pies upon the other. Racks, gibbets, and dungeons, are the emblems and re&s;ources of his government. It is but the natural con&s;equence of &s;uch a govern|ment, that the Portugue&s;e, with many advantages of per&s;onal character, and local &s;ituation, are the meane&s;t and mo&s;t degraded people, and the crown of Portugal the lea&s;t re&s;pected, of any in Europe.</P>
<P>Sir Benjamin Keene, who knew the Marquis of Pombal early in life, empha|tically de&s;cribes him as a <HI>conceited and puzzled head.</HI> How far the intrepidity of his &s;pirit may de&s;erve the opinion conceived of it, can only be determined by experi|ment. He may have penetration enough to &s;ee into the genius of the people he treats with, and may proportion his own firmne&s;s to their apparent want of it. But this part of his character has never been fairly put to the proof, at lea&s;t by Great Britain. If any farther pre&s;umption in favor of his abilities &s;hould be drawn from his having rai&s;ed him&s;elf to an ab&s;olute dominion over his country, and maintained it &s;o long, it may be weakened by con&s;idering, that the government of Portugal is de&s;potic, and that the talents and intrigues which ingratiate a &s;ervant with his ma&s;ter are &s;ometimes the lea&s;t likely to qualify him for the government of a kingdom. He is &s;agacious; but having &s;eldom the good fortune to rea&s;on upon right principles, his &s;agacity, in many important in&s;tances, &s;erves only to mi&s;lead him. He has had experience; but ill-con&s;idered facts, without principles or in&s;truction, have perplexed his under&s;tanding. Of this we &s;ee a &s;ignal in&s;tance in the con|clu&s;ions he drew from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of one or two great exclu&s;ive trading com|panies in England and Holland. If his zeal for the good of his country be ardent, it certainly is not luminous. He is indu&s;trious beyond mea&s;ure; but his indu&s;try, &s;upported by a jealou&s;y of all competition with him, has this dangerous effect, that while he engro&s;&s;es more of the executive branch than he can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport, no one office of the &s;tate is executed as it &s;hould be, and bu&s;ine&s;s &s;tands &s;till. It is al&s;o to be apprehended, that, by his excluding the inferior mini&s;ters from confidence and information, the kingdom at his death will probably be left with|out a man in office, any way qualified to &s;ucceed him. This is the common policy of favorites; but it pre&s;ents no idea of a great, &s;uperior mind. Con&s;idering his uniform plan of conduct towards the natural allies and natural enemies of Portugal, we may allow him a degree of per&s;onal intrepidity, which does no great honor to his di&s;cretion. The proofs of it, in his internal government, are more equivocal. It does not &s;eem to require much firmne&s;s or re&s;olution to employ an armed force in the oppre&s;&s;ion of a poor, &s;piritle&s;s, unre&s;i&s;ting people. Tyrants, who have trembled on their thrones, have done it with &s;ucce&s;s.</P></NOTE> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'England is united with Portugal by mutual intere&s;ts.
