<LG>
<L>_IN a fair i&s;land, in the &s;outhern main,</L>
<L>Ble&s;t with indulgent skys, and kindly rain,</L>
<L>A Prince&s;s liv'd, of origin divine,</L>
<L>Of bloom coele&s;tial, and imperial line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN that &s;weet &s;ea&s;on when the mounting Sun</L>
<L>Prepares, with joy, his radiant cour&s;e to run,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="3">
Led by the Graces, and the dancing Hours,</L>
<L>And wakes to life the various race of flow'rs;</L>
<L>The lovely Queen for&s;ook her &s;hining court,</L>
<L>For rural &s;cenes, and healthful Sylvan &s;port,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IT &s;o befel, that, as in chearful talk,</L>
<L>Her Nymphs and She purfu'd their ev'ning walk,</L>
<L>On the green margin of the oozy deep,</L>
<L>They found a graceful Youth di&s;&s;olv'd in &s;leep,</L>
<L>His charms the Queen &s;urvey'd with fond delight,</L>
<L>And hung enamour'd o'er the plea&s;ing &s;ight;</L>
<L>By her command the youth was &s;trait convey'd,</L>
<L>And (&s;leeping) &s;oftly in her palace laid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW ruddy morning purpled o'er the skies,</L>
<L>And beamy light un&s;eal'd the &s;tranger's eyes,</L>
<L>Who cry'd aloud, Ye Gods unfold this Scene!</L>
<L>Where am I? what can all the&s;e wonders mean?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<L>SCARCE had he &s;poke, when, with officious care,</L>
<L>Attendant nymphs a fragrant bath prepare;</L>
<L>He ro&s;e, he bath'd, and on his lovely head,</L>
<L>Ambro&s;ial &s;weets, and precious oyl they &s;hed;</L>
<L>To deck his poli&s;h'd limbs, a robe they brought,</L>
<L>In all the various dies of beauty wrought;</L>
<L>Then led him to the Queen, who, on a throne</L>
<L>Of burni&s;h'd gold, and beamy diamonds &s;hone:</L>
<L>But O what wonder &s;elz'd her beauteous gue&s;t!</L>
<L>What love, what exta&s;y his &s;oul po&s;&s;e&s;t!</L>
<L>Entranc'd he &s;tood, and on his falt'ring tongue,</L>
<L>Imperfect words, and half form'd accents hung&punc;</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s the Queen the blooming youth admir'd,</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s delight, and love, her &s;oul in&s;pir'd.</L>
<L>O Stranger! &s;aid the Queen, if hither driv'n,</L>
<L>By adver&s;e winds, or &s;ent a gue&s;t from Heav'n;</L>
<L>To me the wretched never &s;ue in vain,</L>
<L>This fruitful i&s;le with joy approves my reign;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="5">
Then &s;peak thy wi&s;hes, and thy wants declare,</L>
<L>And no denial &s;hall attend thy pray'r:</L>
<L>She paus'd, and blu&s;h'd; the youth his &s;ilence broke,</L>
<L>And kneeling, thus the charming Queen be&s;poke:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O GODDESS! for a form &s;o bright as thine,</L>
<L>Speaks thee de&s;cended of coele&s;tial line&punc;</L>
<L>Low at your feet a pro&s;trate King behold,</L>
<L>Who&s;e faithle&s;s &s;ubjects &s;old his life for gold;</L>
<L>I fly a cruel tyrant's lawle&s;s hand,</L>
<L>And &s;torms have drove my ve&s;&s;el on your &s;trand:</L>
<L>But why do I complain of Fortune's frowns?</L>
<L>Or what are titles! honours! &s;ceptres! crowns!</L>
<L>To this &s;weet moment? whil&s;t in fond amaze,</L>
<L>On &s;uch tran&s;porting excellence I gaze!</L>
<L>Such &s;ymetry of &s;hape! &s;o fair a face!</L>
<L>Such fini&s;h'd elegance! &s;uch perfect grace!</L>
<L>Hear then my only wi&s;h, and O approve</L>
<L>The ardent pray'r, which &s;upplicates thy love.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="6">
From <HI>Neptune,</HI> know, O Prince, my birth I claim,</L>
<L>Replies the Queen, and <HI>Lucida</HI>'s my name;</L>
<L>This i&s;land, the&s;e attendant nymphs he gave</L>
<L>The fair-hair'd daughters of the azure wave:</L>
<L>But he who&s;e fortune gains me for a bride,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t have his con&s;tancy &s;everely try'd;</L>
<L>One day each moon am I compell'd to go</L>
<L>To my Great Father's wat'ry realms below,</L>
<L>Where coral groves coele&s;tial red di&s;play,</L>
<L>And blazing di'monds emulate the day;</L>
<L>In this &s;hort ab&s;ence if your love endures,</L>
<L>My heart and empire are for ever your's;</L>
<L>And hoary <HI>Neptune,</HI> to reward your truth,</L>
<L>Shall crown you with immortal bloom and youth;</L>
<L>But in&s;tant death will on your fal&s;hood wait,</L>
<L>Nor can my tenderne&s;s prevent your fate:</L>
<L>Twice twenty times in wedlock's &s;acred band,</L>
<L>My Royal Father join'd my plighted hand;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="7">
Twice twenty noble youths, alas! are dead,</L>
<L>Who in my ab&s;ence &s;tain'd the nuptial bed;</L>
<L>Your virtues, Prince, may claim a nobler throne;</L>
<L>But mine is yielded on the&s;e terms alone.</L>
<L>Delightful terms! reply'd the raptur'd youth,</L>
<L>Accept my con&s;tancy, my endle&s;s truth:</L>
<L>Perfidious, faithle&s;s men, enrag'd he cry'd!</L>
<L>They merited the fate by which they dy'd:</L>
<L>Accept a heart incapable of change;</L>
<L>Thy beauty &s;hall forbid de&s;ire to range.</L>
<L>No other form &s;hall to my eye &s;eem fair;</L>
<L>No other voice attract my li&s;t'ning ear;</L>
<L>No charms but thine, &s;hall e'er my &s;oul approve;</L>
<L>So aid thy vot'ry, potent God of love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW loud applau&s;es thro' the palace ring;</L>
<L>The duteous &s;ubjects hail their God-like King;</L>
<L>To fea&s;tful mirth they dedicate the day,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t tuneful voices chant the nuptial lay:</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="8">
Love-dittied-airs, hymn'd by the vocal quire,</L>
<L>Sweetly attemper'd to the warbling wire.</L>
<L>But when the Sun de&s;cending &s;ought the main,</L>
<L>And low-brow'd night a&s;&s;um'd her &s;ilent reign,</L>
<L>They to the marriage-bed convey'd the Bride,</L>
<L>And laid the raptur'd Bridegroom by her &s;ide.</L>
<L>Now ro&s;e the morn, and with au&s;picious ray,</L>
<L>Di&s;pell'd the dewy mi&s;ts, and gave the day;</L>
<L>When <HI>Lucida,</HI> with anxious cares oppre&s;t,</L>
<L>Thus wak'd her &s;leeping lord from downy re&s;t,</L>
<L>Soul of my &s;oul, and monarch of my heart,</L>
<L>This day, &s;he cry'd, this fatal day, we part;</L>
<L>Yet, if your love uninjur'd you retain,</L>
<L>We &s;oon &s;hall meet in happine&s;s again,</L>
<L>To part no more, but rolling years employ,</L>
<L>In circling bli&s;s, and never-fading joy:</L>
<L>Alas! my boding &s;oul is lo&s;t in woe!</L>
<L>And from my eyes the tears unbidden flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="9">
<L>JOY of my life, di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e needle&s;s fears,</L>
<L>Reply'd the King, and &s;tay tho&s;e precious tears;</L>
<L>Shou'd lovely <HI>Venus</HI> leave her native sky,</L>
<L>And at my feet, imploring fondne&s;s, lie,</L>
<L>Ev'n &s;he, the radiant Queen of &s;oft de&s;ires,</L>
<L>Shou'd, di&s;appointed, burn with hopele&s;s fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE heart of Man, the Queen's experience knew</L>
<L>Perjur'd, and fal&s;e, yet wi&s;h'd to find him true:</L>
<L>She &s;igh'd, retiring; and, in regal &s;tate,</L>
<L>The King conducts her to the palace gate,</L>
<L>Where &s;acred <HI>Neptune's</HI> chry&s;tal chariot &s;tands,</L>
<L>The wond'rous work of his coele&s;tial hands;</L>
<L>Six harne&s;s'd &s;wans the bright machine convey,</L>
<L>Swift thro' the air, or pathle&s;s wat'ry way;</L>
<L>The birds with eagle-&s;peed the air divide,</L>
<L>And plunge the godde&s;s in the &s;ounding tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="13" REF="10">
<L>SLOW to the court the pen&s;ive King returns,</L>
<L>And &s;ighs in &s;ecret, and in &s;ilence mourns;</L>
<L>So in the grove &s;ad Philomel complains,</L>
<L>In mournful accents, and melodious &s;trains;</L>
<L>Her plaintive woes fill the re&s;ounding lawn,</L>
<L>From &s;tarry-ve&s;per, to the ro&s;y dawn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE King, to mitigate his tender pain,</L>
<L>Seeks the apartment of the virgin train,</L>
<L>With &s;portive mirth &s;ad ab&s;ence to beguile,</L>
<L>And bid the melancholly moments &s;mile;</L>
<L>But there de&s;erted, lonely rooms he found;</L>
<L>And &s;olitary &s;ilence reign'd around:</L>
<L>He call'd aloud, when, lo! a hag appears,</L>
<L>Bending beneath deformity and years;</L>
<L>Who &s;aid, My Liege, explain your &s;acred will,</L>
<L>With joy your &s;overeign purpo&s;e I fulfil.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="11">
My will! dete&s;ted wretch! avoid my &s;ight,</L>
<L>And hide that hideous &s;hape in endle&s;s night.</L>
<L>What? does thy Queen, o'er-run with rude di&s;tru&s;t,</L>
<L>Re&s;olve by force to keep a husband ju&s;t?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YOU wrong, reply'd the hag, your royal wife,</L>
<L>Who&s;e care is love, and love to guard your life;</L>
<L>The race of mortals are by nature frail,</L>
<L>And &s;trong temptations with the be&s;t prevail.</L>
<L>Be that my care, he &s;aid; be thine, to &s;end</L>
<L>The virgin train, let them my will attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE Beldam fled, the chearful Nymphs advance,</L>
<L>And tread to mea&s;ur'd airs, the mazy dance;</L>
<L>The raptur'd Prince, with greedy eye &s;urveys</L>
<L>The bloomy maids, and covets &s;till to gaze;</L>
<L>No more recals the image of his &s;pou&s;e,</L>
<L>(How fal&s;e is Man!) nor recollects his vows;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="12">
With wild incon&s;tancy for all he burns,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Nymph &s;ubdues his &s;oul by turns.</L>
<L>At length a maid &s;uperior to the re&s;t,</L>
<L>Array'd in &s;miles, in virgin beauty dre&s;t,</L>
<L>Receiv'd his pa&s;&s;ion, and return'd his love,</L>
<L>And &s;oftly woo'd him to the &s;ilent grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ENCLOS'D in deepe&s;t &s;hade of full-grown wood,</L>
<L>Within the grove a &s;pacious grotto &s;tood,</L>
<L>Where forty youths in marble &s;eem'd to mourn,</L>
<L>Each youth reclining on a fun'ral urn;</L>
<L>Thither the Nymph directs the Monarch's way;</L>
<L>He treads her foot&s;teps, joyful to obey;</L>
<L>There, fir'd with pa&s;&s;ion, cla&s;p'd her to his brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And thus the tran&s;port of his &s;oul expre&s;t:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>DELIGHTFUL beauty! deck'd with ev'ry charm</L>
<L>High fancy paints, or glowing love can form,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="13">
I &s;igh, I gaze, I tremble, I adore,</L>
<L>Such lovely looks ne'er ble&s;t my eyes before!</L>
<L>Here, under covert of th' embow'ring &s;hade,</L>
<L>For Love's delights, and tender tran&s;ports made,</L>
<L>No bu&s;y eye our raptures to detect,</L>
<L>No envious tongue to cen&s;ure or direct,</L>
<L>Here yield to Love, and tenderly employ</L>
<L>The &s;ilent &s;ea&s;on in extatick joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WITH arms encla&s;p'd, his trea&s;ure to retain,</L>
<L>He &s;igh'd and &s;trove, but &s;trove and &s;igh'd in vain;</L>
<L>She ru&s;h'd indignant from his fond embrace,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t rage, with blu&s;hes, paints her virgin face;</L>
<L>Yet &s;till he &s;ues, with &s;uppliant hands and eyes;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t &s;he to magick charms for vengeance flies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A LIMPID fountain murmur'd thro' the cave;</L>
<L>She fill'd her palm with the tran&s;lucent wave,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="14">
And, &s;prinkling, cry'd, Receive, fal&s;e man, in time&punc;</L>
<L>The ju&s;t reward of thy dete&s;ted crime.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THY changeful &s;ex in perfidy delight,</L>
<L>De&s;pi&s;e perfection, and fair virtue &s;light;</L>
<L>Fal&s;e, fickle, ba&s;e, tyrannick, and unkind,</L>
<L>Who&s;e hearts nor vows can chain, nor honour bind,</L>
<L>Mad to po&s;&s;e&s;s, by pa&s;&s;ion blindly led,</L>
<L>And then as mad, to &s;tain the nuptial bed;</L>
<L>Who&s;e roving &s;ouls no excellence, no age,</L>
<L>No form, no rank, no beauty, can engage:</L>
<L>Slaves to the bad, to the de&s;erving wor&s;t,</L>
<L>Sick of your twentieth love, as of your fir&s;t.</L>
<L>The&s;e STATUES, which this hallow'd grot adorn,</L>
<L>Like thee were Lovers, and like thee for&s;worn;</L>
<L>Who&s;e faithle&s;s hearts no kindne&s;s cou'd &s;ecure,</L>
<L>Nor for a day pre&s;erve their pa&s;&s;ion pure;</L>
<L>Whom neither love, nor beauty, cou'd re&s;train,</L>
<L>Nor fear of endle&s;s infamy and pain.</L>

<L>And icy horror froze his ebbing blood!</L>
<L>Thick &s;hades of death upon his eyelids creep,</L>
<L>And clos'd them fa&s;t in everla&s;ting &s;leep;</L>
<L>No &s;en&s;e of life, no motion he retains,</L>
<L>But fix'd, a dreadful monument remains!</L>
<L>A STATUE now! and if reviv'd once more,</L>
