<HEAD>DORANDO, A SPANISH TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the rich and beautiful province of Andalu&s;ia lived the prince of Dorando, of the race of the ancient kings of Arragon. His family had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in &s;plendour, and &s;e|veral branches of it were e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of Europe. But Don Carlos, the la&s;t of the male line, hav|ing in his youth had &s;ome difference with his &s;overeign, quitted the court, and taking a di&s;gu&s;t at the world, &s;hut him&s;elf up in the ca&s;tle of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Here he lived in retirement for up|wards of thirty years; and although a prince of admirable parts, yet in
<PB N="6" REF="4">
this gloom of &s;olitude his mind lo&s;t its natural vigour; and, indifferent a|bout his affairs, he re&s;igned him&s;elf to the guidance of people who were artful enough to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into his favour.</P>
<P>Don Carlos had no brothers; but an only &s;i&s;ter, amiable and accom|pli&s;hed, educated by the prince&s;s her mother in the &s;tricte&s;t honour and piety. This lady refu&s;ed many ad|vantageous offers of marriage from &s;entiments of delicacy rarely to be found in one of her rank. She was often a&s;ked by her brother to marry; but &s;he diverted the di&s;cour&s;e by tel|ling him, that it was his duty to con|tinue his illu&s;trious line. At la&s;t &s;he li&s;tened to the addre&s;&s;es of Don Spiri|to&s;o, a cavalier of good family, &s;ome|what advanced in life, but of very en|gaging manners. The prince&s;s Ma|ria
<PB N="7" REF="5">
her&s;elf, was then in her forty &s;e|venth year.</P>
<P>Their nuptials were privately ce|lebrated by the bi&s;hop of the city where they lived: for, under&s;tanding that the prince of Dorando had taken up &s;ome prejudice again&s;t Don Spiri|to&s;o, they re&s;olved to conceal their marriage; and accordingly &s;et out for France, taking with them Donna Ju|&s;tina, who had lived both with the prince&s;s and her mother in the cha|racter of a waiting-woman.</P>
<P>They re&s;ided for &s;ome time in a plea&s;ant village in France, till the prince&s;s became pregnant, and her marriage could no longer be conceal|ed; while at the &s;ame time &s;he hop|ed, that the prince her brother could not be offended at an event, of which he &s;hould no &s;ooner hear, than he &s;hould al&s;o be informed of its happy con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">
The prince&s;s therefore wrote an affectionate letter to her brother, ac|quainting him of her &s;ituation, and begging his kind protection; but a|las! the worthy prince had already been mo&s;t unhappily impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>For in the neighbourhood of Do|rando lived the prince of Arvido&s;o, who by an intermarriage of the fa|milies entertained &s;ome hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the e&s;tate of Dorando. The adherents therefore of the family of Arvido&s;o did all in their power to poi|&s;on the ear and vex the noble &s;pirit of the un&s;u&s;pecting Dorando. The principal of the&s;e adherents were Don Stocaccio, Don Tipponi, and Don Ro|domontado. The&s;e three never cea&s;ed to throw the mo&s;t injurious &s;u&s;picions upon the character of the ab&s;ent prin|ce&s;s. They exaggerated every impru|dency in the conduct of Don Spiri|to&s;o,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
&s;o as to prevent any hope of the prince being reconciled to his mar|riage with the lady Maria. At la&s;t the prince&s;s went to Paris, where &s;he was &s;afely delivered of two &s;ons.</P>
<P>This event was an alarming &s;troke to the family of Arvido&s;o with all its train. They therefore formed a &s;cheme, the mo&s;t unju&s;t and cruel both to the prince&s;s Dorando and to her brother, by which they endea|voured to prevent that lady and her &s;ons from inheriting the family po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and at the &s;ame time to de|prive her brother of the happine&s;s he mu&s;t have had to &s;ee his family car|ried down by the i&s;&s;ue of his beloved &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme was no other than a downright accu&s;ation again&s;t the lady Maria, of what is called in the law <HI>Partus, Suppo&s;itio</HI> counterfeiting a birth.
<PB N="10" REF="8">
A report of which they indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated. Few indeed would give credit to &s;o black an a&s;per&s;ion.&mdash;It was however fatal to the repo&s;e of the prince of Dorando. For the&s;e de|&s;igning people repre&s;ented him as a kind of melancholy madman, to whom no body could have acce&s;s; &s;o that they might have a full opportu|nity of practi&s;ing upon his mind. Stocaccio who con&s;tantly re&s;ided with him in the ca&s;tle, though a dull ani|mal, had cunning and wickedne&s;s enough to affect a thorough convic|tion of the prince&s;s's impo&s;ture, and to repeat it continually to her bro|ther. Tipponi told him a variety of &s;tories which he had heard over his cups; and Rodomontado blu&s;tered and &s;wore, that the whole matter was as clear as the &s;un in the fir|mament.&mdash;Blow out my brains,
<PB N="11" REF="9">
mo&s;t mighty prince, would he &s;ay, and to&s;s me from the tower of Tole|do, if ever a more arrant cheat was attempted &s;ince the day that Noah went into his Ark.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Dorando believed the barbarous tale. He did not ima|gine that any man alive could have dared to tell the prince of Dorando, that his &s;i&s;ter was an abandoned and infamous woman, had it not been true beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt. He felt the deepe&s;t angui&s;h; but his &s;pirit was rou&s;ed with indignation; and he re&s;olved never again to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter, and to &s;how her every mark of his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having brought him to this &s;tate of mind, the adherents had no diffi|culty to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns. The gentle&s;t hints were &s;ufficient; &s;o that the prince of Dorando &s;ettled his
<PB N="12" REF="10">
opulent domains on the hou&s;e of Ar|vido&s;o, and &s;unk a family which had been illu&s;trious for ages.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s Maria immediately returned to Spain with her husband and children. Her brother had with|drawn from her even the appoint|ments which he had a&s;&s;igned for maintaining her court; and had it not been for the genero&s;ity of &s;ome of the neighbouring princes, the la|dy Maria Dorando mu&s;t have been reduced to actual want.</P>
<P>All who lived under her brother lamented her &s;ituation. They croud|ed to &s;ee the children, and it was u|niver&s;ally agreed, that Don Ferdi|nand, the elde&s;t, had a &s;trong re&s;em|blance to the prince his uncle; and that Don Philip, the younge&s;t, was the very picture of his mother. The hone&s;t pea&s;ants ki&s;&s;ed the hands of
<PB N="13" REF="11">
the young princes with the &s;incere&s;t marks of joy and affection, wi&s;hing that the prince could only &s;ee his ne|phews, as that would be &s;ufficient to convince him how fal&s;e were the &s;u&s;|picions again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But the prince had received too &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, and was too clo&s;e|ly watched. Often did the lady Ma|ria write to him in the mo&s;t moving terms; but all in vain. She at la&s;t re&s;olved to make a de&s;perate effort, and went to the gate of his ca&s;tle with her two children. And there did the prince&s;s Dorando and her &s;ons &s;tand like the lowe&s;t &s;upplicants, till the prince &s;hould return an an|&s;wer to a pathetic letter which &s;he &s;ent up to him.&mdash;The prince began to relent. He walked through his ca&s;tle mu&s;ing with much agitation, while the big tear ran down his
<PB N="14" REF="12">
cheek. But Stocaccio, like a hell|hound, dogged him from room to room, and with a villainous appear|ance of concern, bid him be firm, nor weakly yield to the whining of a wo|man, who had forfeited every claim to his regard. The prince overcome with a tumult of contending pa&s;&s;i|ons, retired to his clo&s;et; and Stocac|cio de&s;ired the &s;ervants to tell the la|dy Maria, that &s;he could have no ad|mittance there.</P>
<P>Treatment &s;o har&s;h and &s;evere from him who had formerly been a fond brother, was beyond mea&s;ure di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing to the prince&s;s; but &s;he behaved with calmne&s;s and moderation, for her hope was fixed on heaven.</P>
<P>Soon after this her younge&s;t &s;on died. She was in the deepe&s;t afflic|tion, and the bitterne&s;s of her &s;orrow &s;o affected her &s;pirits that &s;he never
<PB N="15" REF="13">
recovered. When &s;he felt the ap|proach of death, &s;he received the ho|ly &s;acrament with much devotion. She called to her bed-&s;ide the prince Ferdinand her fir&s;t born, and now on|ly child, and, after leaving with him many pious le&s;&s;ons, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf a little, as if animated with extraor|dinary life; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My &s;on, &s;aid &s;he, be not ca&s;t down. God ble&s;s you. God make you a good and an hone&s;t man; for riches I de&s;pi&s;e. Take a &s;word in your hand, and you may one day be as great a hero as &s;ome of your predece&s;&s;ors.'</Q> Having thus &s;poke, &s;he reclined her head with peace and complacency; while Don Ferdinand &s;tood by her like <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the young eaglet of a valiant ne&s;t,'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Douglas a Tragedy.</NOTE></Q> in an atti|tude as if already facing all the dan|gers of the field, and at the &s;ame
<PB N="16" REF="14">
time touched with the deepe&s;t con|cern for his dying mother, who ex|pired a few minutes after.</P>
<P>Don Spirito&s;o, who&s;e liberality of di&s;po&s;ition far exceeded his fortune, was unable to &s;upport his &s;on; but a prince&s;s of great worth, the friend of lady Maria, took under her protecti|on the young Don Ferdinand, and gave him an education &s;uitable to his real birth. And in whatever way it is, that the qualities of nobility are tran&s;mitted, it is certain, that this prince by his &s;entiments, his man|ners, and his air, could not but be ac|knowledged as of &s;uperiour rank. His uncle however remained inexorable, and Don Ferdinand never flattered him&s;elf with any expectation of hap|pier days.</P>
<P>But Providence, who&s;e awful de|&s;igns cannot be penetrated by mor|tals
<PB N="17" REF="15">
&mdash;Providence, who is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed to manife&s;t his ju&s;tice, even in this world of imperfection, where we are not always to expect it&mdash;Provi|dence determined to reward the piety of the prince&s;s Maria Dorando, by re&s;|cuing her memory from reproach, and vindicating the honour of her &s;on by means the mo&s;t extraordinary.</P>
<P>Not far from the ca&s;tle of Doran|do was the &s;eat of a knight, who claimed a di&s;tant connection with the illu&s;trious hou&s;e, having the honour to bear the name; but he was never allowed to approach the ca&s;tle, as he was well known to be inviolably at|tached to the family from whence he &s;prung, and had even fought &s;everal duels with per&s;ons who &s;aid in his pre&s;ence, that the lady Maria had brought home &s;uppo&s;ititious chil|dren.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="16">
The daughter of this knight was Donna Eleanora, of uncommon ta|lents, and all the high &s;pirit of her race. Her brother was an officer in the &s;ervice of Naples, during the mo|narchy of Don Carlos, when king of the two Sicilies, and as the prince of Dorando had been baptized the &s;ame day with his maje&s;ty, received the &s;ame name, and been ever intimate with him, Donna Eleanora deter|mined to &s;olicite his intere&s;t in fa|vour of her brother, and as Stocac|cio was ju&s;t dead, &s;he re&s;olved to im|prove a favourable interval.</P>
<P>She accordingly went to the ca&s;tle, and was allowed admittance to the prince.&mdash;Dorando ro&s;e and received her with an ea&s;y dignity, as if he had not been a day ab&s;ent from court. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Fair lady, &s;aid he, how am I &s;o for|tunate.&mdash;To whom am I indebted
<PB N="19" REF="17">
for &s;o agreeable a vi&s;it?'</Q> Donna E|leanora told him her name and Fa|mily, and why &s;he had pre&s;umed to come into his pre&s;ence; and &s;he &s;poke with &s;uch openne&s;s and unaffected vivacity, that the prince was charm|ed with her behaviour,&mdash;told her that &s;he might command his &s;ervices in every thing, and that he would the very next morning di&s;patch a &s;pecial courier to Naples, with the &s;tronge&s;t recommendations of her brother to his Sicilian maje&s;ty. He in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould &s;tay with him a day or two, and very plea&s;antly &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I hope, cou&s;in, you are not afraid of being eaten alive by the wild man. God forbid, Sir, &s;aid Donna Eleanora, that I, who&s;e veins are warm with the blood of Dorando, &s;hould be af|fected by &s;uch imaginations. I am a woman, but, I hope, I am free
<PB N="20" REF="18">
from the weakne&s;&s;es which render our &s;ex contemptible.&mdash;Will your highne&s;s allow me to &s;ee the ca&s;tle.'</Q></P>
<P>The prince conducted her through the apartments with the mo&s;t cour|teous affability. Donna Eleanora ad|mired their grandeur; but her atten|tion was chiefly fixed on the portraits of the renowned heroes of the hou&s;e of Dorando. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah prince! &s;aid &s;he, is it not &s;acrilege to let &s;o glorious a &s;un &s;et for ever?&mdash;Your highne&s;s will forgive me for mentioning the name of the lady Maria.&mdash;My tears mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e.'</Q>&mdash;The prince fetched a deep &s;igh, and &s;tood for a minute or two as if looking towards heaven, but made no reply. Don|na Eleanora a&s;&s;umed a gayer tone;&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Well then, prince, is there no la|dy in Spain who de&s;erves the ho|nour of having her picture placed
<PB N="21" REF="19">
in this gallery? Are women &s;o de|generated, that the hou&s;e of Doran|do mu&s;t fail for want of a con&s;ort?'</Q> The prince ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and walk|ed a-cro&s;s the room, as if he had &s;omething in his mind which he could not communicate. Donna E|leanora was not at all di&s;compo&s;ed. Though &s;he had heard many reports, that the prince was &s;ubject to furious fits, &s;he con&s;idered them as the in|ventions of intere&s;ted people; and &s;he &s;tood fearle&s;s and unconcerned, till he recovered from his reverie; and a&s;king her ten thou&s;and pardons, led her to the room where dinner was &s;erved up.</P>
<P>Donna Eleanora appeared at table with &s;uch gracefulne&s;s and maje&s;ty, that the prince often fixed his eyes upon her, and then ha&s;tily withdraw|ing them, was heard to &s;ay,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'This
<PB N="22" REF="20">
is &s;trange!&mdash;This is &s;trange!'</Q>&mdash;Af|ter dinner &s;he was &s;hewn to her a|partment to take a <HI>&s;ie&s;to,</HI> or gentle &s;leep, as is the cu&s;tom in Spain. She dreamed that a lady appeared to her with a cele&s;tial countenance, inform|ing her, &s;he was the prince&s;s Maria, and &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Noble lady, I am come to tell you, that Donna Eleanora was born for the deliverance of my injured &s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>This vi&s;ion left a wonderful im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Donna Elea|nora; &s;he wi&s;t not well what to think of it.&mdash;She ro&s;e and went to the draw|ing room, where &s;he found the prince reclined on a &s;ofa, and playing on the lute with inimitable ta&s;te; &s;he begged that he would continue his mu&s;ic, of which &s;he was very fond. The prince did &s;o, and touched the in&s;trument with &s;uch delicacy, that
<PB N="23" REF="21">
Donna Eleanora thought her&s;elf in an enchanted region. His airs were mo&s;tly melancholy; but he would now and then entertain the lady with a favourite love-&s;ong. After this they talked together till &s;upper; and the prince &s;eemed more and more delight|ed with her conver&s;ation. When &s;he retired to her room at night, &s;he could hardly &s;leep for reflecting on the extraordinary &s;cene of the former day: but how much was &s;he &s;urpriz|ed next morning, when, on coming down to breakfa&s;t, &s;he found the knight her father &s;itting with the prince of Dorando.</P>
<P>His highne&s;s acco&s;ted her with true Spani&s;h gallantry. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Donna E|leanora, it would &s;eem that heaven has de&s;tined you for my happine&s;s. I &s;ent an expre&s;s at midnight for your father, whom I rejoice to &s;ee
<PB N="24" REF="22">
under this roof. If your affections are not engaged, I hope you will accept the hand of the prince of Dorando.'</Q></P>
<P>Donna Eleanora was &s;truck with wonder. The vi&s;ion came full in her mind; and &s;he adored the benignity of Providence. Then turning to the prince; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My affections, &s;aid &s;he, are no otherways engaged than to this illu&s;trious hou&s;e. They have long been &s;o engaged; and they are now a thou&s;and times more &s;o &s;ince I have &s;een the repre&s;entative of the family.&mdash;Your highne&s;s does me an honour which I cannot find words to expre&s;s.&mdash;It &s;hall be the &s;tudy of my life to de&s;erve it.'</Q>&mdash;His high|ne&s;&s;es prie&s;t was called in to his pre|&s;ence, and the ceremony was imme|diately performed. Now madam, &s;aid the prince, I can &s;how you my galle|ry
<PB N="25" REF="23">
without being afraid of any re|proof from you.</P>
<P>The news of this marriage flew o|ver the country, and filled every ho|ne&s;t heart with joy: but it was like a clap of thunder to the hou&s;e of Arvi|do&s;o. They feared that their hopes were bla&s;ted. The adherents could not conceal their vexation, but went about cur&s;ing the day that Stocaccio died, and imprecating vengeance on Donna Eleanora.</P>
<P>The prince Dorando now re&s;umed in a great mea&s;ure his former chear|fulne&s;s. All the nobility around came and paid their court to him: and he found him&s;elf as fit for &s;ociety as e|ver. He went to Sevile with his prin|ce&s;s, and re&s;ided a part of the winter. His levee was continually crouded. A celebrated tragedy, in honour of his family, was performed in the
<PB N="26" REF="24">
public theatre, where the prince him|&s;elf appeared amid&s;t the acclamations of the audience.</P>
<P>Something was &s;till wanting to render the felicity compleat. The prince&s;s Dorando could have wi&s;hed to have brought the prince a &s;on of his own to take up his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but in the mean time &s;he was anxi|ous to undeceive him with regard to his nephew; and when &s;he de&s;paired of her own offspring, &s;he became &s;till more anxious. She took every opportunity of talking to the prince concerning his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;he con|vinced him of the fal&s;ity of many of the &s;tories that had been told him.</P>
<P>It was now ten years &s;ince his ne|phew's birth, but Donna Ju&s;tina was &s;till alive in ob&s;cure apartments at Sevile. The prince was prevailed with to vi&s;it her, and was alone with
<PB N="27" REF="25">
her for a con&s;iderable time, when he examined her as to the whole affair, with that keen penetration for which he was di&s;tingui&s;hed. The accounts which he heard from Donna Ju&s;tina, were &s;o direct, and enforced with &s;uch &s;erious and &s;olemn a&s;&s;everati|ons, while his &s;trict attention made it impo&s;&s;ible for her to di&s;&s;emble, that the prince was much per&s;uaded of his &s;i&s;ter's innocence, and of the honour of his nephew.</P>
<P>He owned this to the prince&s;s his con&s;ort, who in&s;i&s;ted that he was cal|led upon to &s;how his conviction to the world, and to do ju&s;tice to his injur|ed heir. And when the prince &s;eem|ed &s;till to he&s;itate, her eagerne&s;s for the young Don Ferdinand would &s;ometimes throw her into tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, which her enemies repre|&s;ented as gro&s;s affectation, but which
<PB N="28" REF="26">
the prince &s;aw to be real. He there|fore committed to the flames his &s;et|tlements on the hou&s;e of Arvido&s;o, and devi&s;ed his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his nephew Don Ferdinand.</P>
<P>He was often a&s;ked by the prin|ce&s;s to &s;ee his nephew, but he would not agree to it, crying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ah madam! The&s;e wretches&mdash;The&s;e wretches&mdash;They have planted thorns in my mind, which have taken root for &s;o many years, that I cannot entire|ly pull them out, without tearing my&s;elf to pieces. Let me alone! I cannot bear to think of the &s;ubject. It opens afre&s;h the wounds of my heart&mdash;I have been impo&s;ed upon&mdash;I have been unju&s;t&mdash;I have been cruel&mdash;But God knows, my inten|tions were upright&mdash;I have made reparation, and my &s;oul &s;hall re&s;t in peace.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="27">
Soon after this, the prince Carlos Dorando died, and was carried in great funeral pomp to the tomb of his ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The family of Arvido&s;o would not yet give over their de&s;igns upon the wealth of Dorando. Its prince was then in minority, and he had &s;everal guardians of high rank and charac|ter, but &s;o extravagantly keen to ag|grandize their pupil, that they gra&s;p|ed at a tempting appearance, with|out perceiving that it was only a bubble rai&s;ed by the breath of ma|lignity.&mdash;They fondly wi&s;hed to commence a proce&s;s of <HI>Partus Suppo|&s;itio,</HI> again&s;t Don Ferdinand; and to make enquiries for it, they &s;ent pri|vately to Paris Don Stivalbo, a lawyer, who lay under great obligations to the family of Arvido&s;o, and was pre|vailed
<PB N="30" REF="28">

<P>Don Stivalbo was a man of prin|ciple, and he re&s;olved to conduct him|&s;elf with the utmo&s;t impartiality; but when he arrived at Paris, he was &s;oon &s;urrounded by French prie&s;ts, advo|cates, and agents of all kinds, who wi&s;hed no better than &s;o fat a &s;ub|ject as the domains of Arvido&s;o and Dorando to feed upon. The gallant Stivalbo under&s;tanding little of their language, with true Spani&s;h genero|&s;ity, tru&s;ted to the reports of the&s;e gentry; who with many bows, &s;hrugs, and compliments, pretended they had made a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;cove|ries, till Stivalbo had his imagination &s;o warmed, that he him&s;elf gave credit to the impo&s;ture, and a &s;uit was immediately rai&s;ed before the &s;enate of Sevile.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="29">
In the meantime the guardians of Don Ferdinand began to be &s;ome|what apprehen&s;ive, knowing that it was not difficult to bring very extra|ordinary proofs from the <HI>Gavaccios,</HI> as the Spaniards call the French, whom they dete&s;t.&mdash;The prince&s;s dowager was determined to be at the bottom of the affair, and &s;et out her|&s;elf for Paris, carrying with her &s;eve|ral lawyers of great eminence in their profe&s;&s;ion, and remarkable for their honour as private gentlemen. She had the &s;atisfaction to find, upon a careful enquiry, that the hou&s;e of Ar|vido&s;o had been led a wild-goo&s;e|chace, and that there was nothing to fear.</P>
<P>The Arvido&s;o party, however, &s;till continued their pur&s;uit, changing their ground, and taking up a varie|ty of different plans; &s;o that the prin|ce&s;s
<PB N="32" REF="30">
was obliged to make no le&s;s than three or four journeys a-cro&s;s the Py|renees, in order to get every new &s;to|ry refuted; and indeed this was ea&s;y enough, for no &s;ooner did the prie&s;ts of Arvido&s;o conjure up a &s;pectre, than the prince&s;s Dorando found prie&s;ts who as cleverly laid it. Such, how|ever, was the ingenuity of the &s;harp|&s;et emi&s;&s;aries in France, that they con|trived to keep the affair afloat for &s;eve|ral years, while they were magnifi|cently entertained by both parties, who, according to the Pari&s;ian phra&s;e, <HI>avoient beaucoup d'e&s;prit, et donnoient bien &agrave; manger.</HI></P>
<P>While all this was tran&s;acting, it was thought proper to call Don Spi|rito&s;o before the &s;enate of Sevile, to have him examined concerning the particulars of the delivery of the prin|ce&s;s his &s;pou&s;e. He was then very
<PB N="33" REF="31">
old, and brought low with &s;ickne&s;s; but the liveline&s;s of his temper &s;till continued, and he an&s;wered every que&s;tion that was put to him with frankne&s;s and readine&s;s; at the &s;ame time telling the judges, that he had all his life-long had an irregular and imperfect memory, which was now grown &s;till wor&s;e; and therefore it would not be fair &s;hould every ad|vantage be taken of his incon&s;i&s;ten|cies again&s;t his &s;on, whom he had always acknowledged. Not long af|ter this examination, Don Spirito&s;o died, and with his dying breath con|firmed the legitimacy of Don Ferdi|nand.&mdash;Donna Ju&s;tina al&s;o died, and &s;tept into eternity declaring, that &s;he had been pre&s;ent at the birth of the prince.</P>
<P>During the dependance of this te|dious proce&s;s, Don Ferdinand behav|ed
<PB N="34" REF="32">
with a manly compo&s;ure and de|cent gravity, which &s;howed his good &s;en&s;e and proper feelings. He one day called a&s;ide one of his lawyers, and in&s;i&s;ted with him to tell his real opinion of the cau&s;e; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'For, &s;aid he, whatever opulence I might gain by it, I &s;hould be &s;orry to contaminate the blood of a family which I re|vere. But I have another rea&s;on for in&s;i&s;ting to know the event of the cau&s;e; I am yet a young man, and if you think I &s;hall be proved an impo&s;tor, I would lo&s;e no time, but go immediately to the Indies, where my di&s;grace will not be known, and where I may pa&s;s my days with &s;ome reputation.'</Q>&mdash;The lawyer was greatly moved by this &s;peech of the prince; but a&s;&s;ured him that he need be under no concern.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e was at length ready for
<PB N="35" REF="33">
determination; volumes of proofs and memorials were laid before the judg|es; and a day was appointed for its deci&s;ion in the &s;enate of Sevile.</P>
<P>Never was there a more intere&s;t|ing &s;cene. The judgment-hall was filled with a croud of &s;pectators, mo&s;tly people of rank, who waited in the greate&s;t anxiety and trepida|tion, to hear the fate of Dorando. When the &s;enators took their places, not a murmur was heard, all was fixed attention.&mdash;The &s;enators &s;at for &s;ome minutes in awful &s;ilence.</P>
<P>The chief ju&s;tice was a man of great knowledge in the laws of his country; of a clear head and a &s;ound under&s;tanding. He was de&s;cended of a di&s;tingui&s;hed hou&s;e in Andalu&s;ia, which had produced &s;o many &s;ena|tors, that the office &s;eemed to be he|reditary in the family.&mdash;He at la&s;t

<P>Thus &s;poke the chief ju&s;tice, with a warmth of feeling which went to the heart of every &s;pectator. Several of the &s;enators delivered their &s;enti|ments in terms a little different, but
<PB N="39" REF="37">
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e with their head; and only one or two remained &s;till under the cloud of prejudice, but did not venture to &s;ay one word.</P>
<P>The &s;pectators could not contain their joy, but &s;houted as at a bull|fight, or any other of the &s;uperb &s;pectacles of Spain. Mo&s;t of the win|dows of Sevile were that evening il|luminated, and bonefires blazed in every corner of the city, while health and pro&s;perity was drunk to the prince Ferdinand of Dorando.</P>
<P>Stung to the quick, the Arvido&s;o train gna&s;hed their teeth in rage and de&s;pair. They however carried their cau&s;e by appeal, before the grandees of Spain at Madrid; but it only &s;erv|ed to make their de&s;perate &s;cheme fall upon their own heads with re|doubled vengeance. That illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly could hardly hear them

with patience. One of the grandees muttered, that the Arvido&s;o party had &s;aid &s;trong things,&mdash;that they had a heavy memorial.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Heavy! cryed the chancellor of Spain, with a violence that made his brother &s;hrink with|in him&s;elf.&mdash;Heavy! yes it is hea|vy; but heavy as was chaos,'</Q>

No, &s;ignors! While my blood is warm, I hope Spain &s;hall never adopt &s;uch unju&s;tifiable mea&s;ures. I &s;peak with more confidence, that upon this occa&s;ion, I &s;ee not the lea&s;t doubt.

<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly, except a very few, unanimou&s;ly agreed with the e|loquent mini&s;ter&mdash;and by a great majority it was carried, that the plaintiff &s;hould pay 50000 zechins as co&s;ts of &s;uit. Thus was the prince Ferdinand of Dorando rai&s;ed to the illu&s;trious &s;tate of which he had been &s;o long deprived. His dignity &s;at ve|ry

ea&s;y upon him, for it was natural to him. Envy and malevolene gra|dually decayed; and even his bittere&s;t enemies began to repent.</P>
<P>He was one day out a hunting in a large fore&s;t, which belonged in common to him and to the prince of Arvido&s;o, who was now come of age, and was a prince of great virtue and accompli&s;hments; but was prevented by tho&s;e about him from ever having any intercour&s;e with the prince of Dorando, though they had often &s;een each other at court. The prince of Arvido&s;o was al&s;o out a hunting that morning, and his dogs happened to catch the &s;cent of the wild boar which was pur&s;ued by the prince of Doran|do. The &s;pirited Arvido&s;o followed hard in the chace; but ju&s;t as the boar &s;topped to turn upon the dogs, his hor&s;e fell within half a yard of
<PB N="46" REF="44">
the furious animal. At that in&s;tant the prince of Dorando came up, and &s;eeing the prince Arvido&s;o engaged with the boar, in who&s;e mouth he had broke his &s;word, and was now in the mo&s;t imminent danger; he run to his relief, and attacking the boar with great &s;trength and agili|ty, he &s;oon laid him dead upon the ground.</P>
<P>During the heat and hurry of this adventure, the two princes had total|ly forgot all family differences; and indeed had hardly time to recollect their own quality.&mdash;They now &s;tood for a minute and looked at each o|ther, when Arvido&s;o, with tears of gratitude in his eyes, run up, and throwing him&s;elf into the arms of Dorando; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Generous prince, &s;aid he, forgive what is pa&s;t, I am not to blame; let there be henceforth an e|verla&s;ting

<P>In the mean time the attendants of Arvido&s;o, who had been left far behind, came up.&mdash;They had been in great apprehen&s;ions for their prince. But how were they a&s;toni&s;h|ed and confounded, when they &s;aw him with the prince of Dorando!&mdash;They &s;topt &s;hort and were at a lo&s;s what to do.&mdash;The prince of Arvido|&s;o perceived it, and calling to them to approach, he advanced walking arm in arm with the prince of Do|rando, and told his attendants what had happened, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Gentlemen, you now &s;ee my deliverer and be&s;t friend.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="46">
The prince of Dorando &s;aluted the company with a graceful ea&s;e; and turning to the prince of Arvido&s;o, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Sir, &s;aid he, your highne&s;s has been plea&s;ed to call me your friend&mdash;Let me have a proof that you are in earne&s;t.

<P>It was accordingly agreed, and they all went to the ca&s;tle of Doran|do, where they were &s;umptuou&s;ly entertained.&mdash;After &s;upper, when warm a little with wine, the two princes retired to a window, where, after talking a few minutes in pri|vate, prince Arvido&s;o made a &s;ign to Don Pedro to join them. When he came, the prince Arvido&s;o &s;aid to the

<P>Dorando a&s;&s;ured Don Pedro that he heartily forgave him, and as he knew him to be a man of parts would be glad to &s;how him every mark of his attention. This done, they returned to the table. Dorando
<PB N="50" REF="48">
