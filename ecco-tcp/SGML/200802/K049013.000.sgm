<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE German original of this Play, which its Author &s;tiles 'a Dramatic Romance of the fourteenth century,' has not, I believe, as yet been publi&s;hed. It never came under my in&s;pection; and, if it had, I could have made no u&s;e of it, not under&s;tanding a &s;yllable of the language.</P>
<P>The model, upon which I worked was an Engli&s;h tran&s;lation, that profe&s;&s;ed nothing more than fidelity to the words of the author, and this I have no doubt it correctly perform|ed. In this copy I di&s;covered the frame-work of what might be made a &s;plendid &s;pectacle; and the known liberality of tho&s;e, in whom the property and conduct of the Theatre are
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
ve&s;ted, has more than equalled every expecta|tion I could ground upon their &s;upport. What el&s;e I di&s;covered, except as above &s;tated, it may not become me to &s;ay, for I have no right to pronounce upon an author, who compo&s;es in a language unknown to me; but certain it is, I &s;tand re&s;pon&s;ible to the Public for every &s;en|tence in this Drama now before them, with the exception of a very few periods indeed, and tho&s;e of no great importance. Let Kot|zebue therefore an&s;wer for no more than be|longs to him&mdash;the plot and fabric of <HI>JOANNA.</HI> Whether I have marred it or mended it in the execution, can only be decided when the Public &s;hall be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means for comparing them.</P>
<P>It has &s;o rarely been my habit to write upon any plot but of my own fabrication and invention, that what I a&s;&s;ert in the Prologue is mo&s;t &s;trictly true; viz.</P>
<Q><L>"All, who cou'd judge my labour, wou'd confe&s;s</L>
<L>"Originality had made it le&s;s."</L></Q>
<P>Whether from inaptitude for the ta&s;k, or from whatever other cau&s;e my embarra&s;&s;ments have
<PB N="v" REF="5">
proceeded, &s;uch they have been, and &s;o many times have I woven and unwoven this Pe|nelope's web, that if plays were only to be appreciated by the pains they co&s;t in compo&s;ing, this of mine would have a merit, which I &s;u&s;pect the world will not be in the humour to attach to it. Then indeed I &s;hould have one fair exception to &s;et again&s;t the many in|&s;tances of precipitation, of which I &s;tand ac|cu&s;ed, but of which I cannot be duly convicted, till it is known of how many hours my day con&s;i&s;ts, and what portion of tho&s;e I devote to my &s;tudies.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;everal authors in&s;tance a di&s;patch in compo&s;ition, of which I have no conception; but, with re&s;pect to the drama now &s;ubmitted, whether I did or did not write it, <HI>&s;tans pede in uno,</HI> I can only a&s;&s;ure the Public, I will never &s;tand upon German legs any more, but take my chance with my countrymen for &s;o much of their favour as my own independant efforts can obtain for me.</P>
<P>I have now been &s;o often before the Reader, that I mu&s;t claim the privilege of addre&s;&s;ing him as a friend, whom I am not to flatter,
<PB N="vi" REF="6">
and in who&s;e company I am not to degrade my&s;elf by an unmanly &s;tile of &s;upplication, a&s;|&s;umed for no other purpo&s;e than to invoke his candour; the which, if he has not, fal&s;e dif|fidence will not create, and, if he has, plain &s;peaking will not offend. I therefore &s;hall not &s;cruple to &s;ay (&s;peaking under the &s;anc|tion of age and long experience) that the diction of Joanna is not inferior to that of any of my mo&s;t favoured plays. I know I have outlived the time, when a &s;imple and con&s;i&s;tent fable, developed in correct and cla&s;&s;ic diction, pre&s;enting characters to be found in nature, and producing incidents not irrecon|cileable to probability, can no longer attract: I al&s;o perceive I have lived to &s;ee the time, when not content with the eccentricities of our own &s;tage, we have gone to that of the Ger|mans for fre&s;h &s;upplies of what we were over|&s;tocked with&mdash;fal&s;e writing and fal&s;e moral. It is too often that the &s;ucce&s;s or failure of a play depends upon the <HI>ca&s;t,</HI> not upon the com|po&s;ition; of cour&s;e the play is written more for the actors behind the curtain, than for the audience before it: this makes Tragedy run
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
riot, and Comedy play the antick. We have actors, who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible power over the ri&s;ibility of the &s;pectator, that our writers for the &s;tage find their account in availing them&s;elves of tho&s;e powers, and produce a &s;pe|cies of compo&s;ition, which, departing from the character of the legitimate drama, may be &s;aid to border very nearly upon farce and mum|mery.</P>
<P>Where fa&s;hion points, the &s;tage will follow. If, endeavouring to write according to nature and good models, the dramatic author finds him&s;elf de&s;erted by the Town, who but will be weary of the attempt? If the public ta&s;te is vitiated, the remedy is not with him: the critic may take up the cau&s;e; a good <HI>dramatic cen&s;or</HI> may do much, but a &s;currilous one can effect nothing. Are authors only to be la&s;hed, and their mi&s;leaders to be pa&s;&s;ed over uncor|rected? The enlarged expences of our royal theatres do not warrant their proprietors in oppo&s;ing them&s;elves to the public ta&s;te&mdash;how then &s;hould authors undertake it?</P>
<P>As I have been uniformly adver&s;e in my opinion to the introduction of the&s;e German
<PB N="viii" REF="8">
dramas on the Engli&s;h &s;tage, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed my rea&s;ons for undertaking to adapt this of Joanna were &s;trong ones, and in yield|ing to them, I have only to regret, that my endeavours have not been more &s;erviceable to the intere&s;ts of a theatre, to which I have every obligation, not only for the fair and honourable treatment I experienced from the proprietors, but al&s;o for the warm and cordial &s;upport I received from the performers. <HI>Mr. Incledon</HI> in particular has a claim to my be&s;t acknowledgments for his very honour|able and zealous per&s;everance in his duty, under circum&s;tances of &s;uch an afflicting nature, as might have fully ju&s;tified him for declining it.</P>
<P>In the copy now printed, I have not alto|gether adhered to the Prompter's book, as it was altered after the fir&s;t night's repre&s;enta|tion. The Reader will ob&s;erve I have re|tained the incident of Lazarra's falling by the hand of Joanna; this I have done, becau&s;e I &s;ee no particular rea&s;on for departing &s;o entirely from the author's fir&s;t conception, though good rea&s;on obtained, in point of action, for the altera|tion
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
that was made on the &s;econd night. On the German &s;tage, Albert, in the combat with his rival, &s;tumbles over the root of a tree, and falls to the ground; in this in&s;tant Joanna ru&s;hes in accoutred in the complete armour of a warlike knight, and with a huge &s;word of two-handed &s;way di&s;patches Lazarra at a &s;troke. Albert, thus critically re&s;cued, ri&s;es and reque&s;ts the unknown Knight to put up his vi&s;or, when to his a&s;toni&s;hment he di&s;|covers his pre&s;erver in the per&s;on of his wife. How they may manage the&s;e matters on the German &s;tage I cannot pretend to &s;ay; perhaps their actors may be better duelli&s;ts, and their actre&s;&s;es more adroit in warlike operations than ours; but if we found diffi|culty in the action, &s;implified as it is, how much more &s;hould we have been embarra&s;&s;ed in point of execution, had we undertaken to perform it in the &s;pirit of the original?</P>
<P>In the concluding &s;cene of the third act, Wen&s;el in the original gets drunk upon the &s;tage, and the keys are taken out of his cham|ber by Philip, whil&s;t his intoxicated father
<PB N="x" REF="10">
lies buried in profound &s;leep. If what I &s;ub&s;tituted in place of this incident is not &s;o near to nature as the original, it is certainly le&s;s offen&s;ive to decorum, and better &s;uited to the manners of our Engli&s;h &s;tage. When I am &s;peaking of this &s;cene (unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t prominent in the play) I cannot pa&s;s it over without acknowledging my obligations to the young and ri&s;ing actor, who&s;e energetic and impre&s;&s;ive execution in the character of Philip gave &s;uch brilliancy to the repre&s;en|tation, and di&s;played powers, which, when drawn forth by abler authors, and better opportunities, cannot fail to place him in the very highe&s;t rank of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Joanna of Kotzebue is kept out of &s;ight during the whole time that Lazarra is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her ca&s;tle, and of cour&s;e is never before the audience but in the opening and conclu&s;ion of the play. It appeared to me expedient to fill up this <HI>hiatus,</HI> and of cour&s;e her &s;cenes in the middle acts are &s;upple|mentary.</P>
<P>In like manner, Wolf in the original is
<PB N="xi" REF="11">
merely the &s;hadow of a character. The &s;up|port of &s;uch an actor as <HI>Mr. Munden,</HI> is an object which every author will reach at with avidity. I &s;incerely thank him for his cordial a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I wi&s;h my efforts had been more proportionate to his merit. To the performers, who conde&s;cended to appear in characters, neither adequate to their merits, nor con&s;onant with their feelings, I have more to offer than acknowledgments; I mu&s;t beg them to accept my apology.</P>
<P>As there is no mu&s;ic in the original, I mu&s;t in ju&s;tice exonerate the author from all re&s;pon|&s;ibility on the &s;core of the di&s;carded Page. When his &s;inging cea&s;ed, his &s;ervices were no longer wanted; two &s;ongs were compo&s;ed for this character, though but one was perform|ed; the&s;e exqui&s;ite melodies will, I hope, be publi&s;hed by the compo&s;er; and that I may not appear to keep that out of &s;ight, which will do him &s;o much honour to produce, I retain tho&s;e &s;ongs in my copy, and of cour&s;e the whole part of Eugene.</P>
<P>The overture, choru&s;&s;es, and &s;ongs, inci|dental
<PB N="xii" REF="12">
to the piece, with four &s;ymphonies be|tween the acts, were all compo&s;ed for the oc|ca&s;ion by <HI>Mr. Thomas Bu&s;by:</HI> He al&s;o, in the run of the piece, &s;ub&s;tituted a new Quin|tetto in&s;tead of the Pea&s;ant's chorus in the opening &s;cene, and at the &s;ame time withdrew the finale of Joy, Joy, Joy! and introduced upon the ninth night a &s;horter and mo&s;t bril|liant chorus to the following words:
<Q><L>"Hail, glorious day! Death &s;trikes our impious foe,</L>
<L>"And Victory binds her wreath on Virtue's brow."</L></Q></P>
<P>It is matter of the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction to me to find that the Public have done ju&s;tice to his eminent abilities. I &s;incerely hope this his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in the dramatic line will encou|rage him to employ his talents upon a larger and more &s;plendid &s;cale. Where genius &s;o &s;ublime is combined with &s;cience &s;o profound, what is there within the province of his &s;tudies, which the world may not expect from <HI>Mr. Bu&s;by?</HI></P>
<P>As the oppo&s;ition, which was given to this play upon the fir&s;t evening only of its per|formance, has pa&s;&s;ed over me without injury, I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed over it without a re|mark,
<PB N="xiii" REF="13">
but that I am given to under&s;tand an opinion was in circulation, that I had vanity enough to conceive I had prepared a &s;pec|tacle, and compo&s;ed a drama to rival, nay to eclip&s;e, one that was triumphantly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;i&s;ter &s;tage. As an author, I have never appealed from the deci&s;ions of the theatre: con&s;cious that nothing can be more perfectly at the mercy of the Public than an author's reputation, when he has committed it to the &s;tage, I have never offered a &s;ingle word in arre&s;t of judgment, however rigo|rous, nor per&s;i&s;ted to obtrude my&s;elf, when I had once di&s;covered I was no longer welcome. That we had no rea&s;on to yield the play up upon the partial clamour of the fir&s;t night, the event of the &s;econd clearly evinced; not a murmur was heard, and the applau&s;e was ge|neral. If I had been the arrogant man, which it is pre&s;umed I was thought to be by &s;ome of my opponents, their re&s;entment would have fallen &s;o much more heavily upon the li|beral proprietors of the theatre, than upon me individually, that there would have been infinitely more cruelty than ju&s;tice in their
<PB N="xiv" REF="14">
revenge. But the ta&s;k of adapting this Ger|man Drama to our &s;tage was no work of my &s;eeking, and though I expended more pains upon it than I ever did upon any play in my life, the hopes I formed of its &s;ucce&s;s were chiefly grounded on the brilliancy of the &s;pec|tacle, and the excellence of the mu&s;ic: As for Pizarro, I envy not his &s;ucce&s;s; I do not a&s;|pire to rival it, I cannot wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en it; and if any man doubts my &s;incerity, let him put him&s;elf in the predicament of an author, for years held off from receiving the fair and moderate earnings of his productive &s;ervices; and looking to that very fund for indemnifica|tion, then let him a&s;k his con&s;cience what he would &s;ay to &s;uch an idle imputation, and his an&s;wer &s;hall be mine.</P>
