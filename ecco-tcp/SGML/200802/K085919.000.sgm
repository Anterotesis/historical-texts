<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hone&s;t farmer! Hey day! what are all you London folks flatterers? Tho' by the bye, I believe I am as hone&s;t as mo&s;t of my neighbours: Tom Tilwell can lay his hand upon his heart, and &s;ay he never be|lied providence, nor wi&s;hed a ri&s;e of provi&s;ions in his life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hoity toity! if many farmers were of this way of thinking, we cornfactors and &s;ale&s;men &s;hould be &s;oon as thin as Pharoah's lean kine&mdash;a parcel of poor devils indeed: the fine&s;t &s;cheme in the world, except clipping and coining, would be totally ruined. No, no, Heaven &s;end the landlords to rai&s;e their rents, and the farmers to keep pace with them.&mdash;Ah, you don't know the plea&s;ure and profit we enjoy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plea&s;ure! what, in &s;tarving your fellow crea|tures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Starving&mdash;no, no, mercy forbid! not &s;o bad as that, only lock their jaws a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't, by appearance, ma&s;ter Skinflint, &s;eem as if your jaws were much locked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me! why, you would not put me on a foot|ing with ragged weavers in Spittle-fields, or &s;lip-&s;hod taylors in Clement Danes.&mdash;You don't &s;ee into the bottom of things.&mdash;We are friends to government as well as our&s;elves. The Engli&s;h, ma&s;ter Tilwell, Londoners particularly, are, with full bellies, in&s;olent, grumbling politicians; they pretend to think for them&s;elves.&mdash;Now
<PB N="3" REF="9">
weaken the beer when you rai&s;e the price; clip &s;hort their beef and pudding; keep provi&s;ions high, and wages low&mdash;you have 'em as tame as &s;o many pet pigeons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>At this rate your bu&s;ine&s;s is of great u&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The greate&s;t importance, I a&s;&s;ure you.&mdash;We are on the Change-alley plan exactly; as they have at all times letters ready from Dantzig, Hamburgh, the Hague, or an expre&s;s from India over land, to influence &s;tock, &s;o we have accounts from every &s;hire in England, to keep up the markets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then you have corre&s;pondents in all parts of the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one on that account.&mdash;We don't care how things really are; we can make them as we plea&s;e.&mdash;Why I have burned the uplands with &s;un-&s;hine, and drowned the low-lands with rain a thou&s;and times. I was the means of lifting up the peck loaf two-pence la&s;t week; and have another petition from the bakers to the court of aldermen in my pocket; it's penned in &s;uch a lamentable &s;tile, that I don't doubt, with one or two more, working up to a &s;hilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What when there's a fine crop, fine weather for harve&s;t, and new corn coming in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that.&mdash;Did not you &s;ee a para|graph of mine in the papers la&s;t week, that all the old was gone. Yet, would you think it now, for all I take &s;o much pains, and make it &s;o fine a time for gentlemen of the cru&s;t, I was obliged to arre&s;t one of the fraternity ye&s;terday for a hundred and fifty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>He mu&s;t be a bad manager indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apes quality&mdash;as mo&s;t of our trades-people do now-a-days&mdash;keeps a country-hou&s;e, a phae|ton, and, for ought I know, a mi&s;tre&s;s. But I don't &s;o much blame him for this, if he had any brains: why the blockhead, in five years trade for him&s;elf, never had &s;en&s;e enough to make a loaf two or three ounces &s;hort; and is &s;o plaguy con&s;cientious, as not to u&s;e any allum, becau&s;e its unwhole&s;ome.&mdash;Time for me to look &s;harp, ma&s;ter Tilwell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after all, friend Skinflint, though I am a farmer, and may gain by it, I think it hard
<PB N="5" REF="11">
that there &s;hould be plenty and &s;carcity at the &s;ame time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SKINFLINT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Politic, politic.&mdash;If all the fi&s;h that's caught was brought to market, and all the meat that's killed &s;old, both would &s;oon be a drug. There is one in&s;tance among many&mdash;Mat. Marrow-bone, of Honey-lane market, as pretty a fellow as ever whetted a knife, will frequently, rather than take a halfpenny a pound under the fixed price on Saturday night, tip ten guineas worth into the Thames on Sunday morning. He has &s;how'd me his Thames regi&s;ter, and a &s;weet pretty collection of drowned joints there is. However, I advi&s;ed him for the future, to bury all; becau&s;e, you know, in the water it may feed and increa&s;e the &s;tock of fi&s;h, which might hurt the fle&s;h trade. Mat. took the hint&mdash;ah, he's a &s;en&s;ible &s;pirited fellow as ever &s;old thirteen ounces for a pound; and can afford to live genteelly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TILWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, notwith&s;tanding what you &s;ay, I am for peace and plenty. You &s;hall hear my thoughts on that &s;ubject, in a &s;ong taught me by our vicar, as hearty an old blade as ever wore black, or u&s;ed a tobacco-&s;topper.</P>
