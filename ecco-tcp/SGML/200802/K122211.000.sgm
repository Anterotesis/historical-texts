<HEAD>SPEECH OF <HI>Mr. FRANCIS,</HI> ON THE SUSPENSION OF THE HABEAS CORPUS ACT, <DATE>FRIDAY, JANUARY 23, 1795.</DATE></HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>MR. FRANCIS ro&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Speaker, in the following terms:</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>There were &s;ome material pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;peech of the learned gentleman oppo&s;ite to me, which I think my&s;elf called upon to take the earlie&s;t opportunity to an&s;wer, while they are yet fre&s;h in my memory and in the recollection of the Hou&s;e. They were not ad|dre&s;&s;ed to <HI>me</HI> particularly; but, as they conveyed a charge again&s;t the principles and proceedings of a Society, to which I belong, and from who&s;e cau&s;e I am not at all di&s;po&s;ed to &s;eparate my own, I con&s;ider my&s;elf as a per&s;on put upon his defence, and therefore in|titled for a &s;hort time to the attention of the Hou&s;e. No man is le&s;s likely to abu&s;e it than I am. Sir, I am not going to find fault with the honourable gentleman's per&s;onal deportment in this Hou&s;e, or to the language he makes u&s;e of. They are always civil and conciliating, and therefore he may be &s;ure that nothing is farther from my thoughts than to offer him any offence. It is to his a&s;&s;er|tions and to his doctrines that I mean to oppo&s;e contradiction and
<PB N="2" REF="2">
re&s;i&s;tance. But, fir&s;t of all, allow me to clear my honourable friend near me of a very unju&s;t imputation thrown upon his con|duct this day, as if he had irregularly taken the opening of the de|bate out of the hands of the learned gentleman, to whom, as mover of the que&s;tion, it did undoubtedly belong. Now, Sir, on this point I &s;hall content my&s;elf with appealing to your te&s;timony, when I affirm that the learned gentleman moved the &s;econd reading of the bill, without offering to &s;ay one word even of introduction to that motion, and that you were going to put the que&s;tion, and mu&s;t have done &s;o, if my honourable friend had not then ri&s;en to oppo&s;e it. The learned gentleman &s;ays, he under&s;tood it was agreed that the debate &s;hould be taken on the &s;ub&s;equent motion for your leaving the chair. If &s;o, he purpo&s;ely re&s;erved him&s;elf for a later &s;tage of the bill, and has clearly acquitted my honourable friend of taking the debate out of his hands. But I know of no &s;uch agree|ment. On the contrary, I perfectly recollect it was &s;tated to him, from this &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, that it was intended to debate the principle of the bill, which could not be done at any time &s;o properly as on the motion for the &s;econd reading.</P>
<P>I find, Sir, that the Society of Gentlemen, a&s;&s;ociated for the purpo&s;e of obtaining a Parliamentary Reform, of all of whom in|vidually he &s;peaks with great civility, are no favourites of his in their collective capacity. It is very difficult for us to give him &s;a|tisfaction. If we continue our proceedings, it leads to dangerous con&s;equences, though po&s;&s;ibly our intentions may be innocent. We are exciting di&s;content and faction among the people, and encou|raging others to go lengths, to which we perhaps may not be deter|mined to follow them. We &s;hall be an&s;werable then as, in fact, the abettors and promoters of mi&s;chief, in which at fir&s;t we do not partake, and which afterwards we might be determined to re&s;i&s;t. If we re&s;olve to &s;u&s;pend our proceedings, that's ten times wor&s;e; that's a re&s;olution, which fills the learned gentleman with horror and di&s;may! The moment we leave off acting at all, we excite and exhort the people to have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t dangerous and crimi|nal exce&s;&s;es! It is difficult to conceive, by what medium in our con|duct we could thoroughly have &s;atisfied the learned gentleman. All I &s;hall &s;ay is, that his judgement of our conduct is not quite im|partial, and that I am happy in being able to appeal to a judge|ment and authority, even in his own profe&s;&s;ion, much higher than his, though I am far from meaning to undervalue his cen&s;ure: I mean that of the eminent Magi&s;trate, who pre&s;ided at the late trials. The Chief Ju&s;tice took more occa&s;ions than one to &s;peak of our Society in terms of di&s;tinction and approbation, and to inti|mate
<PB N="3" REF="3">
his opinion that our proceedings furni&s;hed an example, which might be followed with innocence and &s;afety, if not with advantage. I am fearful of over&s;tating any thing &s;aid by the learned Judge; but I believe it is in the memory of every one who had the happine&s;s of hearing him, that he &s;tated it as an aggravation of the mi&s;conduct imputed to other Societies, that, in ours, they had an example of prudence and moderation, by which they might have been in&s;truct|ed, and ought to have been guided. But, Sir, whether we are favourites with the learned gentleman or not, we have a right to demand ju&s;tice from him, and from all men. If he came to this Hou&s;e prepared to bring a charge of any kind again&s;t us or our pro|ceedings, he was bound in common equity to give us notice of his intention. With all his books, and his papers, and his memoran|dums before him, it is not fair to expect that we &s;hould be able to an&s;wer him, upon the in&s;tant, on dates, on circum&s;tances, and ex|pre&s;&s;ions, belonging to tran&s;actions which took place a year or two ago. Yet, with all the&s;e advantages on his &s;ide, and taken by &s;urpri&s;e as I am, and having nothing to rely on but my own im|mediate recollection of the terms of a letter, written by us in May 1792, and &s;igned by Lord John Ru&s;&s;ell, as Chairman, I meet the learned gentleman in direct contradiction upon his &s;tatement of that letter. I affirm, that he has mi&s;quoted our letter; that he has e&s;|&s;entially changed the terms of it, and attributed to us a declared &s;pecific motive for declining, as we did, all future intercour&s;e with the Society for Con&s;titutional Information, which I am &s;ure we did not expre&s;s, and which I am confident we never thought of. He &s;ays di&s;tinctly, and more than once, that we came to that re&s;o|lution, becau&s;e the other Society, by their acts and proceedings, <HI>had violated the con&s;titution.</HI> If they had, we ought to have gone much farther, than barely re&s;olving to have no concern with them. I cannot recollect the exact terms of our letter, but I &s;tand firmly and &s;ecurely upon the negative. I &s;ay the learned gentleman has done that which no accu&s;er ought to do; he imputes criminality to certain acts united to certain declarations of ours, and he changes materially the terms of tho&s;e declarations. On that point I am at i&s;&s;ue with him: he has the books before him; let him confute me if he can <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The pa&s;&s;age in the letter from the Society, dated the 12th of May, 1792, and &s;igned by Lord John Ru&s;&s;ell, to which the Attorney General alluded, &s;tands in the following words:</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t beg leave at the &s;ame time to decline all future intercour&s;e with a Society, who&s;e views and objects, as far as we can collect them from the various re&s;olutions and proceedings which have been publi&s;hed, we can|not help regarding as irreconcilable with tho&s;e real intere&s;ts, on which you profe&s;s to inform and enlighten the people."</P></NOTE>. He confe&s;&s;es, however, that we did right in declining
<PB N="4" REF="4">
all intercour&s;e with that dangerous Society; but then he &s;ays, we ought to have acted in the &s;ame manner to the Sheffield Society, who, it &s;eems, have written a letter to the other, full of exception|able language and matter. Agreed. I think &s;o too; but then that letter ought to have been before us. It could be no motive of action to <HI>us,</HI> unle&s;s it had come by &s;ome means or other under our view, or in &s;uch a way as to oblige us to take notice of it. Now, I do a&s;&s;ure the Hou&s;e, upon my honour, that, to the be&s;t of my know|ledge and belief, I never heard of that letter before. I hope I have &s;aid enough to vindicate our Society from the imputations, to which &s;ome gentlemen have thought us liable, and to ju&s;tify the fa|vourable opinion entertained of us, by per&s;ons of greater judgement, as well as more elevated authority. If not, I de&s;ire it may be un|der&s;tood that I &s;hall hold my&s;elf ready, and forthcoming at all times, to an&s;wer any di&s;tinct charges that may be brought again&s;t us.</P>
<P>In this place, Sir, it may be nece&s;&s;ary for me to ob&s;erve, that neither this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, nor any other, that regards the principles and conduct of the different Societies, a&s;&s;ociated for the purpo&s;e of ob|taining a Parliamentary Reform, is foreign from the que&s;tion now before the Hou&s;e. The in&s;titution and proceedings of tho&s;e Socie|ties have in fact been the real or pretended cau&s;e of all the alarms, which have been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly excited among us, for the &s;afety of the con&s;titution, and of all the mea&s;ures which have been taken by Government for the peace and &s;ecurity of the country, and among the re&s;t, for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas Corpus act. It is no digre&s;&s;ion, therefore, to &s;tate either my own opinion and prin|ciples, or tho&s;e of the A&s;&s;ociation in which I have acted, on the &s;ub|ject of Parliamentary Reform. But my honourable friend near me, in &s;tating his principles and objects, has &s;tated mine. I concur with him in every word he has &s;aid, and adopt it as my own. Sir, I know the inconvenience of particular applications of general opi|nions, and I &s;hall take care to avoid it. Without referring, there|fore, to this or that Parliament, I &s;ay generally, but with the deep|e&s;t conviction that can be impre&s;&s;ed on the human mind, by long ob&s;ervation and daily experience, that, with a Hou&s;e of Commons at the di&s;po&s;al and command of the Crown, the liberty and pro|perty of this country are not &s;afe. Under &s;uch a combination and &s;teward&s;hip the liberty will go fir&s;t, and the property will &s;oon follow it. With re&s;pect to univer&s;al repre&s;entation, and all the dangers and all the reproaches attached to it, I mu&s;t &s;ay that I think the
<PB N="5" REF="5">
learned gentleman ought to be careful to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e, who pro|fe&s;s to have &s;uch a &s;cheme in contemplation, from others who reject it with a di&s;approbation as full and entire, though not, perhaps, with &s;uch extravagant horror, as he does. He ought to have known that the idea of univer&s;al repre&s;entation was never encouraged or countenanced by any act or declaration whatever of our A&s;&s;ociation. If he knows any thing to the contrary, I call upon him now, I challenge him, to point it out. Of <HI>me,</HI> in particular, he mu&s;t have known, and, in candour, he ought to have acknowledged, that it is not po&s;&s;ible for any man to go farther than I have done, to reject, to re&s;i&s;t, and to explode every project of that nature, and every principle and argument &s;et up to &s;upport it; a project, however, &s;o chimerical, and &s;o utterly impracticable, that it is &s;uperfluous to load it with charges of danger and malignity. But, let the charac|ter of &s;uch projects be what it may, there is one reflection on the conduct of Government towards the unfortunate per&s;ons who have profe&s;&s;ed them, which ought to &s;trike every man of honour or humanity with di&s;gu&s;t and abhorrence. While they are per&s;ecuting to de&s;truction a number of per&s;ons, who&s;e unenlightened &s;incerity de&s;erves in&s;truction rather than puni&s;hment, for maintaining the&s;e mi&s;chievous doctrines, ob&s;erve with what guarded caution, with what profound &s;ilence, they pa&s;s by the original author, the prime mover of all the&s;e doctrines; who, if the&s;e people are deluded, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of their delu&s;ion; who, if they have erred, is an|&s;werable for their errors; who, if they are criminal, &s;hould be pu|ni&s;hed for their crimes. Sir, I &s;peak from po&s;itive knowledge on the&s;e points. I have conver&s;ed with &s;everal of the&s;e advocates for univer&s;al repre&s;entation, and I never met with one of them, who did not quote the Duke of Richmond for his authority; who did not take his arguments from letters written and publi&s;hed by the noble Duke, as they &s;aid, for popular in&s;truction. If the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame were left among men, is it a thing that could be endured for a moment, that, while the men, whom his writings have deluded, are pro&s;ecuted and puni&s;hed, the noble Duke him&s;elf &s;hould not only go free and unnoticed, but continue a Member of that very Cabinet, by which the&s;e pro&s;ecutions are promoted and enforced, with all the influence of Government? I will not believe it po&s;&s;ible that his Grace can take an active &s;hare in the&s;e mea&s;ures; I di&s;mi&s;s that thought the moment it occurs to me; &s;uch conduct would ex|ceed the bounds of human depravity. I acquit the noble Duke of it; but &s;till he belongs to the Admini&s;tration; and whether he op|po&s;es their mea&s;ures in this in&s;tance or not, is unknown to the Pub|lic. But let the doctrine I allude to be ever &s;o mi&s;chievous, and
<PB N="6" REF="6">
ever &s;o dangerous, is it in fact, is it in truth, the real object of all the apprehen&s;ions and terrors which are &s;aid to be excited by it? I do not believe it; I do not believe that the enemies of reform are &s;o much terrified by it as they pretend to be. They know as well as I do that it is nothing but a vi&s;ion, which can never be &s;ub&s;tan|tiated; a mere ab&s;traction, which can never be realized. No, Sir; whatever they may pretend, this is not the true ground of their unea&s;ine&s;s. It is the rea&s;onable, the moderate, the practicable plan, which really fills them with terror and anxiety. That, perhaps, might be accompli&s;hed; the other never can; nor, if it were even to obtain for a moment, could it po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and I am con|vinced that, if it were po&s;&s;ible to drive tho&s;e per&s;ons to an option, they would prefer the &s;econd to the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they would fore&s;ee that the mi&s;chiefs inevitable in the execution of &s;uch a &s;cheme, or even in the attempt, would determine every rea&s;onable man in the country to revert and &s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem; that is, to &s;uffer the con&s;titution to langui&s;h and di&s;&s;olve in its corruption, or gradually to peri&s;h by decay, rather than to encounter the direct and po&s;itive dangers of a change &s;o violent and extreme, to which <HI>their</HI> minds would naturally unite the certainty of in&s;tant de&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is now propo&s;ed to the Hou&s;e to renew the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act, with as much ea&s;e and indifference, as if the ar|bitrary power of impri&s;oning any man, for any time, without bring|ing him to trial, were fit to be given to the King's Mini&s;ters when|ever they de&s;ired it, and continued in their hands as long as they thought fit. They do not come to us, as they ought to do, with a new ca&s;e of con&s;piracy and trea&s;on, &s;upported by later di&s;coveries, by fre&s;h evidence, and by a report of the re&s;ult of both to the Hou&s;e. No, Sir; they content them&s;elves with affirming that it is &s;o, and by calling upon us to prove the contrary, if we can; that is, they &s;hift the burden of the proof from the a&s;&s;ertion to the negative, and con|clude that the Hou&s;e is ready to believe that every thing they affirm is true, unle&s;s we can bring evidence to prove that it is fal&s;e. The&s;e gentlemen contend, that the trea&s;ons and con&s;piracies of la&s;t year re|main in <HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> and in full force. Why, Sir, if that propo&s;ition were ever &s;o true, they ought to prove it now, by the adduction of fre&s;h evidence, regularly examined by another Committee of In|quiry, and by them reported to the Hou&s;e. Much more ought they to do &s;o, if they pretended, which in truth they do not pretend, that they had di&s;covered a new &s;et of plots, and a new li&s;t of con|&s;pirators. I have never &s;aid, that a ca&s;e may not exi&s;t, in which the rights of individuals, however important, ought to give way to the &s;ecurity of the Public. No rea&s;onable man, no friend of his
<PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y">
country, will deny it. What I contend for is, that when arbitrary powers are demanded, for the &s;ake of the common &s;afety, the ca&s;e that ju&s;tifies the demand &s;hould be made out, in every in&s;tance, by its own &s;pecific evidence. Nothing of this kind has been done or attempted; the ground they take now, is the &s;ame as they took la&s;t year; the evidence they re&s;ort to, is the &s;ame they have had before them above two years, and which hitherto they have made no u&s;e of, but by pro&s;ecutions and trials, in which they have utterly failed. Every one of the con&s;pirators, of who&s;e guilt they pretended to be &s;o confident la&s;t year, has either been acquitted by his country, or di&s;charged by them&s;elves. If they have any other criminals to pro|duce, on the ground of the inquiries and reports made to us la&s;t year, for what rea&s;on have they neglected to u&s;e the power they had, and to &s;ecure and bring them to trial in this long interval? The evidence is the &s;ame that it was two years ago; the &s;ame docu|ments and letters were read to us la&s;t year, and may be &s;o again this time twelvemonth. They do not pretend to &s;ay that they have any other; they mu&s;t, therefore, confe&s;s that that evidence is in&s;uf|ficient, or that they them&s;elves are criminal in not having hitherto acted upon it. In demanding a renewal of power, they condemn them&s;elves; for, if they had done their duty, while they had it, a renewal now would be unnece&s;&s;ary. Or are we to under&s;tand that they have left the&s;e urgent duties unperformed, on purpo&s;e to keep a pretence in re&s;erve for continuing in their hands a power to drag any man they plea&s;e from his hou&s;e, from his family, from his af|fairs; to have his papers ran&s;acked, to have all his private concerns expo&s;ed, and to be continued in clo&s;e confinement, without trial, as long as they think proper? All this, they tell us, however, is <HI>no puni&s;hment!</HI> It is pure mercy intended for the &s;ecurity of the indivi|dual, and to prevent him from carrying his dangerous di&s;po&s;itions into criminal effect. This language, Sir, would be very &s;u&s;picious at all times, but particularly when it comes from men, who will not allow that trial and acquittal are any &s;atisfactory proof of inno|cence, and who affirm that, notwith&s;tanding the pro&s;ecutions and verdicts which have taken place in the la&s;t year, the ground they then took is not in the &s;malle&s;t degree altered; that the plots and con&s;piracies &s;tand exactly where they did; that the&s;e propo&s;itions are &s;elf-evident, and require nothing but to be &s;tated and affirmed upon their authority. The di&s;tinctions they have recour&s;e to on this &s;ubject, are indeed of a piece with the re&s;t of their conduct. If you tru&s;t to the opinions of the&s;e gentlemen, you mu&s;t conclude, as they do, that the finding of a bill by a grand jury, who have nothing before them but &s;ome &s;elected evidence of the accu&s;er, amounts to
<PB N="8" REF="8">
a &s;trong pre&s;umption of guilt; but that the verdict of a petty jury, who hear both parties, and in who&s;e pre&s;ence the whole of the evi|dence on both &s;ides is minutely canva&s;&s;ed, does not amount to any no, not the &s;malle&s;t, pre&s;umption of innocence. I &s;hall now con|clude, Sir, with &s;ubmitting two plain que&s;tions to the&s;e learned gen|tlemen, to which I hope and expect they will give me a plain, intel|ligible an&s;wer, &s;uch a one as a Commoner of England, contending for his rights, though perhaps not qualified to defend them in the way in which they are attacked, by legal cunning or &s;kilful arguments, has a right to demand from him who invades them. We have been repeatedly a&s;&s;ured, that any hard&s;hip which the per&s;ons con|fined la&s;t year might have &s;uffered, from the length of their impri|&s;onment, was not to be imputed to the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Habeas Corpus act; becau&s;e, without the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of that act, they would, or they might have been, confined ju&s;t as long under the law as it &s;tood. If &s;o, I de&s;ire them to tell me what they want, or what they will gain by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; or, in fact, what have they gained by &s;u&s;pending it at all? On their own &s;hewing they might have confined the &s;ame per&s;ons, or any others, whom they &s;u&s;pected, ju&s;t as long as they did, and full as long as any man ought to be impri|&s;oned, on bare &s;u&s;picion, and without trial. My &s;econd que&s;tion is, for what rea&s;on, even admitting all their ground, and &s;uppo&s;ing all their &s;u&s;picions to be well founded, they think it nece&s;&s;ary to take this dangerous power at the pre&s;ent moment; I mean, while Parlia|ment is &s;itting? Without it, they can &s;ecure any per&s;on they &s;u&s;pect; and if, at any given moment, they &s;hould really want a farther power, what have they do but, as they did la&s;t year, to come to this Hou&s;e, and pa&s;s another act of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle day? In the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the nation, I take it for grant|ed that they have no thoughts pf proroguing Parliament; but, as long as the Legi&s;lature is a&s;&s;embled, it is <HI>their</HI> proper office and duty, which they cannot delegate &s;afely or hone&s;tly to the Mini&s;ters of the Crown, to watch over the per&s;onal rights of the &s;ubject, while they are providing for the general &s;afety of the community. To the&s;e que&s;tions, Sir, I demand and expect a plain, di&s;tinct, and rational an&s;wer.</P>
