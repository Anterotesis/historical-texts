<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>An Invocation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COME, bright Love of Fame, in&s;pire my glowing Brea&s;t: Not thee I call, who over &s;welling Tides of Blood and Tears, do&s;t bear the Heroe on to Glory, while Sighs of Millions waft his &s;preading Sails; but thee, fair, gentle Maid, whom <HI>Mne&s;is,</HI> happy Nymph, fir&s;t on the Banks of <HI>Hebrus</HI> did&s;t produce. Thee, whom <HI>Maeonia</HI> educated, whom <HI>Mantua</HI> charm'd, and who, on that fair Hill which overlooks the proud Metro|polis of <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;at, with thy <HI>Milton,</HI> &s;weetly tun|ing the Heroic Lyre; fill my ravi&s;hed Fancy with the Hopes of charming Ages yet to come. Foretel me that &s;ome tender Maid, who&s;e Grandmother is yet unborn, hereafter, when under the fictitious Name of <HI>Sophia,</HI> &s;he reads the real worth which once exi&s;ted in
<PB N="2" REF="7">
my <HI>Charlotte,</HI> &s;hall, from her &s;ympathetic Brea&s;t, &s;end forth the heaving Sigh. Do thou teach me not only to fore&s;ee, but to enjoy, nay, even to feed on future Prai&s;e. Comfort me by a &s;olemn A&s;&s;urance, that when the little Parlour in which I &s;it at this In|&s;tant, &s;hall be reduced to a wor&s;e furni&s;hed Box, I &s;hall be read, with Honour, by tho&s;e who never knew nor &s;aw me, and whom I &s;hall neither know nor &s;ee.</P>
<P>And thou, much plumper Dame, whom no airy Forms nor Phantoms of Imagination cloathe: Whom the well-&s;ea&s;oned Beef, and Pudding richly &s;tained with Plumbs delight. Thee, I call; of whom in a <HI>Trachtchugt</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Canal the fat Ufrow Gelt, impregnated by a jolly Merchant of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> was delivered: In <HI>Grub&s;treet-</HI>School did&s;t thou &s;uck in the Elements of thy Erudition. Here ha&s;t thou, in thy maturer Age, taught Poetry to tickle not the Fancy, but the Pride of the Patron. Comedy from thee learns a grave and &s;olemn Air; while Tragedy &s;torms loud, and rends the affrighted Theatres with its Thunder. To &s;ooth thy wearied Limbs in Slumber, Alderman Hi&s;tory tells his tedious Tale; and again to awaken thee, Mon&s;ieur Romance performs his &s;ur|prizing Tricks of Dexterity. Nor le&s;s thy well-fed Book&s;eller obeys thy Influence. By thy Advice the heavy, unread, Folio Lump, which long had dozed on the du&s;ty Shelf, piece-mealed into Numbers, runs nimbly through the Nation. In&s;tructed by thee &s;ome Books, like Quacks, impo&s;e on the World by pro|mi&s;ing Wonders; while others turn Beaus, and tru&s;t all their Merits to a gilded Out&s;ide. Come, thou jolly Sub&s;tance, with thy &s;hining Face, keep back thy In|&s;piration, but hold forth thy tempting Rewards; thy &s;hining, chinking Heap; thy quickly-convertible Bank-bill, big with un&s;een Riches; thy often-varying Stock; the warm, the comfortable Hou&s;e; and,
<PB N="3" REF="8">
la&s;tly, a fair Portion of that bounteous Mother, who&s;e flowing Brea&s;ts yield redundant Su&s;tenance for all her numerous Off-&s;pring, did not &s;ome too greedi|ly and wantonly drive their Brethren from the Teat. Come thou, and if I am too ta&s;tele&s;s of thy valuable Trea&s;ures, warm my Heart with the tran&s;porting Thought of conveying them to others. Tell me, that through thy Bounty, the prattling Babes, who&s;e innocent Play hath often been interrupted by my Labours, may one Time be amply rewarded for them.</P>
<P>And now this ill-yoked Pair, this lean Shadow and this fat Sub&s;tance, have prompted me to write, who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall I invoke to direct my Pen?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Genius; thou Gift of Heaven; without who&s;e Aid, in vain we &s;truggle again&s;t the Stream of Nature. Thou, who do&s;t &s;ow the generous Seeds which Art nouri&s;hes, and brings to Perfection. Do thou kindly take me by the Hand, and lead me through all the Mazes, the winding Labyrinths of Nature. Initiate me into all tho&s;e My&s;teries which profane Eyes never beheld. Teach me, which to thee is no difficult Ta&s;k, to know Mankind better than they know them&s;elves. Remove that Mi&s;t which dims the Intellects of Mortals, and cau&s;es them to a|dore Men for their Art, or to dete&s;t them for their Cunning in deceiving others, when they are, in rea|lity, the Objects only of Ridicule, for deceiving them|&s;elves. Strip off the thin Di&s;gui&s;e of Wi&s;dom from Self-Conceit, of Plenty from Avarice, and of Glory from Ambition. Come thou, that ha&s;t in&s;pired thy <HI>Ari&s;tophanes,</HI> thy <HI>Lucian,</HI> thy <HI>Cervantes,</HI> thy <HI>Rabe|lais,</HI> thy <HI>Moliere,</HI> thy <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> thy <HI>Swift,</HI> thy <HI>Marivaux,</HI> fill my Pages with Humour; 'till Man|kind learn the Good-nature to laugh only at the Fol|lies of others, and the Humility to grieve at their own.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="9">
And thou, almo&s;t the con&s;tant Attendant on true Genius, Humanity, bring all thy tender Sen&s;ations. If thou ha&s;t already di&s;po&s;ed of them all between thy <HI>Allen</HI> and thy <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> &s;teal them a little while from their Bo&s;oms. Not without the&s;e the tender Scene is painted. From the&s;e alone proceed the noble, di&s;in|tere&s;ted Friend&s;hip, the melting Love, the generous Sentiment, the ardent Gratitude, the &s;oft Compa&s;|&s;ion, the candid Opinion; and all tho&s;e &s;trong Ener|gies of a good Mind, which fill the moi&s;tened Eyes with Tears, the glowing Cheeks with Blood, and &s;well the Heart with Tides of Grief, Joy, and Be|nevolence.</P>
<P>And thou, O Learning, (for without thy A&s;&s;i&s;tance, nothing pure, nothing correct, can Genius produce) do thou guide my Pen. Thee, in thy favourite Fields, where the limpid, gently rolling <HI>Thames</HI> wa&s;hes thy <HI>Etonian</HI> Banks, in early Youth I have wor&s;hip|ped. To thee, at thy birchen Altar, with true <HI>Spar|tan</HI> Devotion, I have &s;acrificed my Blood. Come, then, and from thy va&s;t luxuriant Stores, in long An|tiquity piled up, pour forth the rich Profu&s;ion. Open thy <HI>Maeonian</HI> and thy <HI>Mantuan</HI> Coffers, with what|ever el&s;e includes thy Philo&s;ophic, thy Poetic, and thy Hi&s;torical Trea&s;ures, whether with <HI>Greek</HI> or <HI>Ro|man</HI> Characters thou ha&s;t cho&s;en to in&s;cribe the pon|derous Che&s;ts: Give me a while that Key, to all thy Trea&s;ures, which to thy <HI>Warburton</HI> thou ha&s;t entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, come Experience long conver&s;ant with the Wi&s;e, the Good, the Learned, and the Polite. Nor with them only, but with every Kind of Character from the Mini&s;ter at his Levee, to the Bailiff in his Spunging-Hou&s;e; from the Dutche&s;s at her Drum, to the Landlady behind her Bar. From thee only can the Manners of Mankind be known; to which
<PB N="5" REF="10">
the reclu&s;e Pedant, however great his Parts, or exten|&s;ive his Learning may be, hath ever been a Stranger.</P>
<P>Come all the&s;e, and more, if po&s;&s;ible; for ardu|ous is the Ta&s;k I have undertaken: And without all your A&s;&s;i&s;tance, will, I find, be too heavy for me to &s;upport. But if you all &s;mile on my Labours, I hope &s;till to bring them to a happy Conclu&s;ion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>What befel Mr.</HI> Jones <HI>on his Arrival in</HI> London.</HEAD>
<P>THE learned Dr. <HI>Mi&s;aubin</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the proper Direction to him was, <HI>To Dr.</HI> Mi&s;au|bin, <HI>in the World;</HI> intimating, that there were few People in it to whom his great Reputation was not known, And, perhaps, upon a very nice Examina|tion into the Matter, we &s;hall find that this Circum|&s;tance bears no incon&s;iderable Part among the many Ble&s;&s;ings of Grandeur.</P>
<P>The great Happine&s;s of being known to Po&s;terity, with the Hopes of which we &s;o delighted our&s;elves in the preceding Chapter, is the Portion of few. To have the &s;everal Elements which compo&s;e our Names, as <HI>Sydenham</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, repeated a thou&s;and Years hence, is a Gift beyond the Power of Title and Wealth; and is &s;carce to be purcha&s;ed, unle&s;s by the Sword and the Pen. But to avoid the &s;can|dalous Imputation, while we yet live, of being <HI>one whom No-body knows,</HI> (a Scandal, by the by, as old as the Days of <HI>Homer</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the 2d Ody&s;&s;ey, ver. 175.</NOTE>) will always be the envied Portion of tho&s;e, who have a legal Title either to Ho|nour or E&s;tate.</P>
<P>From that Figure, therefore, which the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer, who brought <HI>Sophia</HI> to Town, hath already made in this Hi&s;tory, the Reader will conclude, doubtle&s;s, it
<PB N="6" REF="11">
mu&s;t have been an ea&s;y Matter to have di&s;covered his Hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> without knowing the particular Street or Square which he inhabited, &s;ince he mu&s;t have been one <HI>whom every Body knows.</HI> To &s;ay the Truth, &s;o it would have been to any of tho&s;e Trade&s;|men who are accu&s;tomed to attend the Regions of the Great: For the Doors of the Great are generally no le&s;s ea&s;y to find, than it is difficult to get Entrance into them. But <HI>Jones,</HI> as well as <HI>Partridge,</HI> was an entire Stranger in <HI>London;</HI> and as he happened to ar|rive fir&s;t in a Quarter of the Town, the Inhabitants of which have very little Intercour&s;e with the Hou&s;e|holders of <HI>Hanover</HI> or <HI>Gro&s;venor</HI> Square, (for he en|tered through <HI>Grays-Inn</HI> Lane) &s;o he rambled about &s;ome Time, before he could even find his Way to tho&s;e happy Man&s;ions, where Fortune &s;egregates from the Vulgar, tho&s;e magnanimous Heroes, the De|&s;cendants of antient <HI>Britons, Saxons,</HI> or <HI>Danes,</HI> who&s;e Ance&s;tors being born in better Days, by &s;un|dry Kinds of Merit, have entailed Riches and Honour on their Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> being at length arrived at tho&s;e terre&s;trial <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields, would now &s;oon have di&s;covered his Lord&s;hip's Man&s;ion; but the Peer unluckily quitted his former Hou&s;e when he went for <HI>Ireland;</HI> and as he was ju&s;t entered into a new one, the Fame of his Equipage had not yet &s;ufficiently blazed in the Neigh|bourhood: So that after a &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s Enquiry 'till the Clock had &s;truck Eleven, <HI>Jones,</HI> at la&s;t, yielded to the Advice of <HI>Partridge,</HI> and retreated to the <HI>Bull</HI> and <HI>Gate</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> that being the Inn where he had fir&s;t alighted, and where he retired to enjoy that Kind of Repo&s;e, which u&s;ually attends Per&s;ons in his Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning he again &s;et forth in Pur&s;uit of <HI>Sophia;</HI> and many a weary Step he took to no bet|ter Purpo&s;e than before. At la&s;t, whether it was that
<PB N="7" REF="12">
Fortune relented, or whether it was no longer in her Power to di&s;appoint him, he came into the very Street which was honoured by his Lord&s;hip's Re&s;idence; and being directed to the Hou&s;e, he gave one gentle Rap at the Door.</P>
<P>The Porter, who, from the Mode&s;ty of the Knock, had conceived no high Idea of the Per&s;on approach|ing, conceived but little better from the Appearance of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was dre&s;t in a Suit of Fu&s;tian, and had by his Side the Weapon formerly purcha&s;ed of the Serjeant; of which, tho' the Blade might be compo&s;ed of well-tempered Steel, the Handle was compo&s;ed only of Bra&s;s, and that none of the bright|e&s;t. When <HI>Jones,</HI> therefore, enquired after the young Lady, who had come to Town with his Lord&s;hip, this Fellow an&s;wered &s;urlily, <Q REND="inline">'That there were no Ladies there.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> then de&s;ired to &s;ee the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e; but was informed that his Lord&s;hip would &s;ee no Body that Morning. And upon grow|ing more pre&s;&s;ing, the Porter &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'He had po&s;itive Orders to let no Per&s;on in; but if you think pro|per,' &s;aid he, 'to leave your Name, I will ac|quaint his Lord&s;hip; and if you call another Time, you &s;hall know when he will &s;ee you.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now declared, <Q REND="inline">'that he had very particular Bu&s;ine&s;s with the young Lady, and could not de|part without &s;eeing her.</Q> Upon which the Porter, with no very agreeable Voice or A&s;pect, affirmed, <Q REND="inline">'That there was no young Lady in that Hou&s;e, and, con&s;equently, none could he &s;ee; adding, Sure you are the &s;trange&s;t Man I ever met with; for you will not take an An&s;wer.'</Q></P>
<P>I have often thought, that by the particular De|&s;cription of <HI>Cerberus</HI> the Porter of Hell, in the 6th <HI>Aeneid, Virgil</HI> might po&s;&s;ibly intend to &s;atyrize the Porters of the great Men in his Time; the Picture, at lea&s;t, re&s;embles tho&s;e who have the Honour to at|tend
<PB N="8" REF="13">
at the Doors of our great Men. The Porter in his Lodge, an&s;wers exactly to <HI>Cerberus</HI> in his Den, and, like him, mu&s;t be appea&s;ed by a Sop, before Ac|ce&s;s can be gained to his Ma&s;ter. Perhaps <HI>Jones</HI> might have &s;een him in that Light, and have recol|lected the Pa&s;&s;age, where the Sybil, in order to pro|cure an Entrance for <HI>Aeneas,</HI> pre&s;ents the Keeper of the <HI>Stygian</HI> Avenue with &s;uch a Sop. <HI>Jones,</HI> in like Manner, now began to offer a Bribe to the human <HI>Cerberus,</HI> which a Footman overhearing, in&s;tantly advanced, and declared, <Q REND="inline">'if Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> would give him the Sum propo&s;ed, he would conduct him to the Lady.'</Q> <HI>Jones</HI> in&s;tantly agreed, and was forth|with conducted to the Lodging of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> by the very Fellow who had attended the Ladies thi|ther the Day before.</P>
<P>Nothing more aggravates ill Succe&s;s than the near Approach to Good. The Game&s;ter, who lo&s;es his Party at Piquet by a &s;ingle Point, laments his bad Luck ten Times as much as he who never came with|in a Pro&s;pect of the Game. So in a Lottery, the Proprietors of the next Numbers to that which wins the great Prize, are apt to account them&s;elves much more unfortunate than their Fellow-Sufferes. In &s;hort, the&s;e kind of hair-breadth Mi&s;&s;ings of Happi|ne&s;s, look like the In&s;ults of Fortune, who may be con&s;idered as thus playing Tricks with us, and wan|tonly diverting her&s;elf at our Expence.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who more than once already had experien|ced this frolick&s;ome Di&s;po&s;ition of the Heathen God|de&s;s, was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like Manner: For he arrived at the Door of Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> about ten Minutes after the Departure of <HI>Sophia.</HI> He now addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Wait|ing-Woman belonging to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> who told him the di&s;agreeable News, that the Lady was gone, but could not tell him whither; and the &s;ame
<PB N="9" REF="14">
An&s;wer he afterwards received from Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> her&s;elf. For as that Lady made no doubt but that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was a Per&s;on detached from her Uncle <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> in Pur&s;uit of his Daughter, &s;o &s;he was too generous to betray her.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Jones</HI> had never &s;een Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> yet he had heard that a Cou&s;in of <HI>Sophia</HI> was mar|ried to a Gentleman of that Name. This, however, in the pre&s;ent Tumult of his Mind, never once re|curred to his Memory: But when the Footman, who had conducted him from his Lord&s;hip's, acquainted him with the great Intimacy between the Ladies, and with their calling each other Cou&s;in, he then recol|lected the Story of the Marriage which he had for|merly heard; and as he was pre&s;ently convinced that this was the &s;ame Woman, he became more &s;urpriz|ed at the An&s;wer which he had received, and very earne&s;tly de&s;ired Leave to wait on the Lady her&s;elf; but &s;he as po&s;itively refu&s;ed him that Honour.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who, though he had never &s;een a Court, was better bred than mo&s;t who frequent it, was in|capable of any rude or abrupt Behaviour to a Lady. When he had received, therefore, a peremptory De|nial, he retired for the pre&s;ent, &s;aying to the waiting Woman, <Q REND="inline">'That if this was an improper Hour to wait on her Lady, he would return in the After|noon; and that he then hoped to have the Honour of &s;eeing her.'</Q> The Civility with which he uttered this, added to the great Comeline&s;s of his Per&s;on, made an Impre&s;&s;ion on the Waiting-Woman, and &s;he could not help an&s;wering; <Q REND="inline">'Perhaps, Sir, you may: And, indeed, &s;he afterwards &s;aid every Thing to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he thought mo&s;t likely to prevail on her to admit a Vi&s;it from the hand&s;ome young Gen|tleman; for &s;o &s;he called him.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> very &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected, that <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf was now with her Cou&s;in, and was denied to him;
<PB N="10" REF="15">
which he imputed to her Re&s;entment of what had happened at <HI>Upton.</HI> Having, therefore, di&s;patched <HI>Partridge</HI> to procure him Lodgings, he remained all Day in the Street, watching the Door where he thought his Angel lay concealed; but no Per&s;on did he &s;ee i&s;&s;ue forth, except a Servant of the Hou&s;e. And in the Evening he returned to pay his Vi&s;it to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> which that good Lady at la&s;t con|de&s;cended to admit.</P>
<P>There is a certain Air of natural Gentility, which it is neither in the Power of Dre&s;s to give, nor to conceal. Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> as hath been before hinted, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this in a very eminent Degree. He met, therefore, with a Reception from the Lady, &s;ome|what different from what his Apparel &s;eemed to de|mand; and after he had paid her his proper Re&s;pects, was de&s;ired to &s;it down.</P>
<P>The Reader will not, I believe, be de&s;irous of knowing all the Particulars of this Conver&s;ation, which ended very little to the Satisfaction of poor <HI>Jones.</HI> For though Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> &s;oon di&s;covered the Lover, (as all Women have the Eyes of Hawks in tho&s;e Matters) yet &s;he &s;till thought it was &s;uch a Lover, as a generous Friend of the Lady &s;hould not betray her to. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;u&s;pected this was the very Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> from whom <HI>Sophia</HI> had flown; and all the An&s;wers which &s;he artfully drew from <HI>Jones,</HI> concerning Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Family, confirmed her in this Opinion. She therefore &s;trictly denied any Knowledge concerning the Place whither <HI>Sophia</HI> was gone; nor could <HI>Jones</HI> obtain more than a Permi&s;&s;ion to wait on her again the next Evening.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> was departed, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> com|municated her Su&s;picion concerning Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> to her Maid; who an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam, he is too pretty a Man, in my Opinion, for any Woman in the World to run away from. I had rather fancy
<PB N="11" REF="16">
it is Mr. <HI>Jones.&mdash;</HI>'Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;aid the Lady, what <HI>Jones?</HI>'</Q> For <HI>Sophia</HI> had not given the lea&s;t Hint of any &s;uch Per&s;on in all their Conver&s;ation: But Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> had been much more communica|tive, and had acquainted her Si&s;ter <HI>Abigail</HI> with the whole Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jones,</HI> which this now again relat|ed to her Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> no &s;ooner received this Informa|tion, than &s;he immediately agreed with the Opinion of her Maid; and, what is very unaccountable, &s;aw Charms in the gallant, happy Lover, which &s;he had overlooked in the &s;lighted Squire. <Q REND="inline"><HI>'Betty,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, 'you are certainly in the right: He is a very pretty Fellow, and I don't wonder that my Cou&s;in's Maid &s;hould tell you &s;o many Women are fond of him. I am &s;orry now I did not inform him where my Cou&s;in was: And yet if he be &s;o terrible a Rake as you tell me, it is a Pity &s;he &s;hould ever &s;ee him any more; for what but her Ruin can happen from marrying a Rake and a Beggar again&s;t her Father's Con&s;ent. I prote&s;t, if he be &s;uch a Man as the Wench de&s;cribed him to you, it is but an Office of Charity to keep her from him; and, I am &s;ure, it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwi&s;e, who have ta&s;ted &s;o bitterly of the Misfortunes at|tending &s;uch Marriages.'</Q></P>
<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by the Arrival of a Vi&s;i|tor, which was no other than his Lord&s;hip; and as nothing pa&s;&s;ed at this Vi&s;it either new or extraordi|nary, or any Ways material to this Hi&s;tory, we &s;hall here put an End to this Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>A Project of Mrs.</HI> Fitzpatrick, <HI>and her Vi&s;it to Lady</HI> Bella&s;ton.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> retired to Re&s;t, her Thoughts were entirely taken up by her Cou|&s;in <HI>Sophia</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI> She was, indeed, a little offended with the former, for the Di&s;ingenuity which &s;he now di&s;covered. In which Meditation &s;he had not long exerci&s;ed her Imagination, before the follow|ing Conceit &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf: That could &s;he po&s;&s;ibly become the Means of pre&s;erving <HI>Sophia</HI> from this Man, and of re&s;toring her to her Father, &s;he &s;hould, in all human Probability, by &s;o great a Service to the Family, reconcile to her&s;elf both her Uncle and her Aunt <HI>We&s;tern.</HI></P>
<P>As this was one of her mo&s;t favourite Wi&s;hes, &s;o the Hope of Succe&s;s &s;eemed &s;o rea&s;onable, that no|thing remained but to con&s;ider of proper Methods to accompli&s;h her Scheme. To attempt to rea&s;on the Ca&s;e with <HI>Sophia,</HI> did not appear to her one of tho&s;e Methods: For as <HI>Betty</HI> had reported from Mrs. <HI>Ho|nour,</HI> that <HI>Sophia</HI> had a violent Inclination to <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;he conceived, that to di&s;&s;uade her from the Match, was an Endeavour of the &s;ame Kind as it would be, very heartily and earne&s;tly to entreat a Moth not to fly into a Candle.</P>
<P>If the Reader will plea&s;e to remember, that the Acquaintance which <HI>Sophia</HI> had with Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> was contracted at the Hou&s;e of Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and mu&s;t have grown at the very Time when Mrs. <HI>Fitz|patrick</HI> lived with this latter Lady, he will want no Information, that Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> mu&s;t have been acquainted with her likewi&s;e. They were, be&s;ides, both equally her di&s;tant Relations.</P>
<P>After much Con&s;ideration, therefore, &s;he re&s;olved to go early in the Morning to that Lady, and endea|vour
<PB N="13" REF="18">
to &s;ee her, unknown to <HI>Sophia,</HI> and to acquaint her with the whole Affair. For &s;he did not in the lea&s;t doubt, but that the prudent Lady, who had often ri|diculed romantic Love, and indi&s;creet Marriages, in her Conver&s;ation, would very readily concur in her Sentiments concerning this Match, and would lend her utmo&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance to prevent it.</P>
<P>This Re&s;olution &s;he accordingly executed; and the next Morning before the Sun, &s;he huddled on her Cloaths, and at a very unfa&s;hionable, un&s;ea&s;onable, unvi&s;itable Hour went to Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> to whom &s;he got Acce&s;s, without the lea&s;t Knowledge or Su&s;|picion of <HI>Sophia,</HI> who though not a&s;leep, lay at that Time awake in her Bed, with <HI>Honour</HI> &s;noring by her Side.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> made many Apologies for this early, abrupt Vi&s;it, at an Hour when, <Q REND="inline">'&s;he &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould not have thought of di&s;turbing her Lady|&s;hip, but upon Bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence.'</Q> She then opened the whole Affair, told all &s;he had heard from <HI>Betty;</HI> and did not forget the Vi&s;it which <HI>Jones</HI> had paid to her&s;elf the preceding Evening.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> an&s;wered with a Smile, <Q REND="inline">'Then you have &s;een this terrible Man, Madam; pray is he &s;o very fine a Figure as he is repre&s;ented? For <HI>Etoff</HI> entertained me la&s;t Night almo&s;t two Hours with him. The Wench I believe is in Love with him by Reputation.'</Q> Here the Reader will be apt to wonder, but the Truth is that Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> who had the Honour to pin and unpin the Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> had received complete Information concerning the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and had faithfully conveyed the &s;ame to her Lady la&s;t Night (or rather that Morning) while &s;he was undre&s;&s;ing; on which Accounts &s;he had been detained in her Office above the Space of an Hour and half.</P>
<P>The Lady indeed, though generally well enough
<PB N="14" REF="19">
plea&s;ed with the Narratives of Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons, gave an extraordinary Attention to her Ac|count of <HI>Jones,</HI> for <HI>Honour</HI> had de&s;cribed him as a very hand&s;ome Fellow, and Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> in her Hurry added &s;o much to the Beauty of his Per&s;on to her Report, that Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> began to conceive him to be a kind of Miracle in Nature.</P>
<P>The Curio&s;ity which her Woman had in&s;pired, was now greatly increa&s;ed by Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> who &s;poke as much in Favour of the Per&s;on of <HI>Jones,</HI> as &s;he had before &s;poken in Di&s;prai&s;e of his Birth, Cha|racter and Fortune.</P>
<P>When Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> had heard the whole, &s;he an&s;wered gravely, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed Madam, this is a Matter of great Con&s;equence. Nothing can certainly be more commendable than the Part you act, and I &s;hall be very glad to have my Share in the Pre&s;er|vation of a young Lady of &s;o much Merit, and for whom I have &s;o much E&s;teem.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Doth not your Lady&s;hip think, &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Fitz|patrick</HI> eagerly, that it would be the be&s;t Way to write immediately to my Uncle, and acquaint him where my Cou&s;in is?'</Q></P>
<P>The Lady pondered a little upon this, and thus an&s;wered&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Why, no, Madam, I think not. <HI>Di We&s;tern</HI> hath de&s;cribed her Brother to me to be &s;uch a Brute, that I cannot con&s;ent to put any Woman under his Power who hath e&s;caped from it. I have heard he behaved like a Mon&s;ter to his own Wife; for he is one of tho&s;e Wretches who think they have a Right to tyrannize over us, and from &s;uch I &s;hall ever e&s;teem it the Cau&s;e of my Sex to re&s;|cue any Woman who is &s;o unfortunate to be under their Power.&mdash;The Bu&s;ine&s;s, dear Cou&s;in, will be only to keep Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern</HI> from &s;eeing this young Fellow, till the good Company, which &s;he will

have an Opportunity of meeting here, give her a proper Turn.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If he &s;hould find her out, Madam, an&s;wered the other, your Lady&s;hip may be a&s;&s;ured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'But Madam, replied the Lady, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould come here,&mdash;tho' indeed it is po&s;&s;ible he may get &s;ome intelligence where &s;he is, and then may lurk about the Hou&s;e.&mdash;I wi&s;h therefore I knew his Per&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Is there no Way, Madam, by which I could have a Sight of him? For otherwi&s;e you know, Cou&s;in, &s;he may contrive to &s;ee him here without my Knowledge.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> an&s;wer'd, <Q REND="inline">'that he had threatened her with another Vi&s;it that Af|ternoon, and that in her Lady&s;hip plea&s;ed to do her the Honour of calling upon her then, &s;he would hardly fail of &s;eeing him between &s;ix and &s;even, and if he came earlier, &s;he would, by &s;ome Means or other, detain him till her Lady&s;hip's Arrival.'</Q>&mdash;Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> replied, <Q REND="inline">'&s;he would come the Mo|ment &s;he could get from Dinner, which &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed would be by &s;even at farthe&s;t, for that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould be acquainted with his Per&s;on.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> failed not to make a proper Re|turn to the Compliment which Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> had be&s;tow'd on her Cou&s;in, and after &s;ome little imma|terial Conver&s;ation withdrew, and getting as fa&s;t as &s;he could into her Chair un&s;een by <HI>Sophia</HI> or <HI>Honour,</HI> returned home.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Which con&s;i&s;ts of Vi&s;iting.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> had walked within Sight of a certain Door during the whole Day, which, though one of the &s;horte&s;t, appeared to him to be one of the longe&s;t in the whole Year. At length the Clock having &s;truck five he returned to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> who, though it was a full Hour earlier than the decent Time of vi&s;iting, receiv'd him very civilly; but &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her Ig|norance concerning <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> in a&s;king for his Angel, had drop'd the Word Cou&s;in; upon which Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Then, Sir, you know we are related, and as we are, you will permit me the Right of enquiring into the Par|ticulars of your Bu&s;ine&s;s with my Cou&s;in.'</Q> Here <HI>Jones</HI> he&s;itated a good while, and at la&s;t an&s;wered, He had a con&s;iderable Sum of Money of hers in his Hands, which he de&s;ired to deliver to her.

To attempt to de&s;cribe this Noi&s;e to tho&s;e who have heard it would be in vain, and to aim at giving any Idea of it to tho&s;e who have never heard the like, would be &s;till more vain: For it may be truly &s;aid,</P>

<P>In &s;hort a Footman knocked, or rather thundered at the Door. <HI>Jones</HI> was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the

Sound, having never heard it before; but Mrs. <HI>Fitz|patrick</HI> very calmly &s;aid, that as &s;ome Company were coming, &s;he could not make him any An&s;wer now; but if he plea&s;ed to &s;tay till they were gone, &s;he inti|mated &s;he had &s;omething to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>The Door of the Room now flew open, and, af|ter pu&s;hing in her Hoop &s;ideways before her, entered Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> who having fir&s;t made a very low Curte&s;y to Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> and as low a one to Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> was u&s;hered to the upper End of the Room.</P>
<P>We mention the&s;e minute Matters for the Sake of &s;ome Country Ladies of our Acquaintance, who think it contrary to the Rules of Mode&s;ty to bend their Knees to a Man.</P>
<P>The Company were hardly well &s;ettled, before the Arrival of the Peer lately mentioned cau&s;ed a fre&s;h Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">urbance and a Repetition of Ceremonials.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">here being over, the Conver&s;ation began to be (as the Phra&s;e is) extremely brilliant. However, as nothing pa&s;t in it which can be thought material to this Hi&s;tory, or, indeed, very material in it&s;elf, I &s;hall omit the Relation; the rather as I have known &s;ome very fine polite Conver&s;ation grow extreamly dull, when tran&s;cribed into Books, or repeated on the Stage. Indeed this mental Repa&s;t is a Dainty, of which tho&s;e who are excluded from polite A&s;&s;emblies, mu&s;t be contented to remain as ignorant as they mu&s;t of the &s;everal Dainties of <HI>French</HI> Cookery, which are only &s;erved at the Tables of the <HI>Great.</HI> To &s;ay the Truth, as neither of the&s;e are adapted to every Ta&s;te, they might both be often thrown away on the Vulgar.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Jones</HI> was rather a Spectator of this elegant Scene, than an Actor in it; for though in the &s;hort Interval before the Peer's Arrival, Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> fir&s;t, and afterwards Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> had addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of their Di&s;cour&s;e to him; yet no &s;ooner was

<P>The Company had now &s;taid &s;o long, that Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> plainly perceived they all de&s;igned to &s;tay out each other.

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>An Adventure which happened to Mr.</HI> Jones, <HI>at his Lodgings, with &s;ome Account of a young Gentle|man who lodged there, and of the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e, and her two Daughters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE next Morning as early as it was decent, <HI>Jones</HI> attended at Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick'</HI>s Door, where he was an&s;wered that the Lady was not at Home; an An&s;wer which &s;urpri&s;ed him the more, as he had walked backwards and forwards in the Street from Break of Day; and if &s;he had gone out, he mu&s;t have &s;een her. This An&s;wer, however, he was o|bliged to receive, and not only now, but to five &s;everal Vi&s;its which he made her that Day. To be plain with the Reader, the noble Peer, had from &s;ome Rea&s;on or other, perhaps from a Regard for the Lady's Honour, in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould not &s;ee Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> whom he looked on as a Scrub, any more; and the Lady had complied in making that Promi&s;e to which we now &s;ee her &s;o &s;trictly adhere.</P>
<P>But as our gentle Reader may po&s;&s;ibly have a better Opinion of the young Gentleman than her Lady|&s;hip, and may even have &s;ome Concern, &s;hould it be apprehended, that during this unhappy Separation from <HI>Sophia,</HI> he took up his Re&s;idence either at an Inn, or in the Street; we &s;hall now give an Ac|count of his Lodging, which was indeed in a very reputable Hou&s;e, and in a very good Part of the Town.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> then had often heard Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> mention the Gentlewoman at who&s;e Hou&s;e he u&s;ed to lodge when he was in Town. This Per&s;on, who as
<PB N="20" REF="25">
<HI>Jones</HI> likewi&s;e knew, lived in <HI>Bond-Street,</HI> was the Widow of a Clergyman, and was left by him at his Decea&s;e, in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two Daughters, and of a compleat Set of Manu&s;cript Sermons.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e two Daughters, <HI>Nancy,</HI> the elder, was now arrived at the Age of &s;eventeen, and <HI>Betty,</HI> the younger at that of ten.</P>
<P>Hither <HI>Jones</HI> had di&s;patched <HI>Partridge,</HI> and in this Hou&s;e he was provided with a Room for him&s;elf in the &s;econd Floor, and with one for <HI>Partridge</HI> in the fourth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Floor was inhabited by one of tho&s;e young Gentlemen, who, in the la&s;t Age were called Men of Wit and Plea&s;ure about Town, and properly enough: For as Men are u&s;ually denominated from their Bu&s;ine&s;s or Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o Plea&s;ure may be &s;aid to have been the only Bu&s;ine&s;s or Profe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Gentlemen to whom Fortune had made all u&s;eful Occupations unnece&s;&s;ary. Play-Hou&s;es, Coffee-Hou&s;es and Taverns were the Scenes of their Rendezvous, Wit and Humour were the Entertainment of their loo&s;er Hours, and Love was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their more &s;erious Moments. Wine and the Mu&s;es con&s;pired to kindle the brighte&s;t Flames in their Brea&s;ts; nor did they only admire, but &s;ome were able to celebrate the Beauty they admired, and all to judge of the Merit of &s;uch Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Such therefore were properly called the Men of Wit and Plea&s;ure; but I que&s;tion whether the &s;ame Appellation may, with the &s;ame Propriety, be given to tho&s;e young Gentlemen of our Times, who have the &s;ame Ambition to be di&s;tingui&s;hed for Parts. Wit certainly they have nothing to do with. To give them their due, they &s;oar a Step higher than their Predece&s;|&s;ors, and may be called Men of Wi&s;dom and Vert&ugrave; (take heed you do not read Virtue). Thus at an Age when the Gentlemen abovementioned employed their Time in toa&s;ting the Charms of a Woman, or in
<PB N="21" REF="26">
making Sonnets in her Prai&s;e; in giving their Opinion of a Play at the Theatre, or of a Poem at <HI>Will'</HI>s or <HI>Button'</HI>s; the&s;e Gentlemen are con&s;idering of Me|thods to bribe a Corporation, or meditating Speeches for the Hou&s;e of Commons, or rather for the Maga|zines. But the Science of Gaming is that which a|bove all others employs their Thoughts. The&s;e are the Studies of their graver Hours, while for their A|mu&s;ements they have the va&s;t Circle of Connoi&s;&s;eur|&s;hip, Painting, Mu&s;ic, Statuary, and natural Philo|&s;ophy, or rather <HI>unnatural,</HI> which deals in the Won|derful, and knows nothing of Nature, except her Mon&s;ters and Imperfections.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> had &s;pent the whole Day in vain En|quiries after Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> he returned at la&s;t di&s;|con&s;olate to his Apartment. Here while he was vent|ing his Grief in private, he heard a violent Uproar be|low Stairs; and &s;oon after a female Voice begged him for Heaven's Sake to come and prevent Murder. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was never backward on any Occa&s;ion, to help the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, immediately ran down Stairs; when &s;tepping into the Dining-room, whence all the Noi&s;e i&s;&s;ued, he beheld the young Gentleman of Wi&s;|dom and <HI>Vert&ugrave;</HI> ju&s;t before mentioned, pinned clo&s;e to the Wall by his Footman, and a young Woman &s;tanding by, wringing her Hands, and crying out, <Q REND="inline">'He will be murdered, he will be murdered; and indeed the poor Gentleman &s;eemed in &s;ome Danger of being choaked,'</Q> when <HI>Jones</HI> flew ha&s;tily to his A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, and re&s;cued him ju&s;t as he was breathing his la&s;t, from the unmerciful Clutches of the Enemy.</P>
<P>Though the Fellow had received &s;everal Kicks and Cuffs from the little Gentleman, who had more Spirit than Strength, he had made it a kind of Scruple of Con&s;cience to &s;trike his Ma&s;ter, and would have con|tented him&s;elf with only choaking him; but towards <HI>Jones</HI> he bore no &s;uch Re&s;pect: He no &s;ooner there|fore
<PB N="22" REF="27">
found him&s;elf a little roughly handled by his new Antagoni&s;t, than he gave him one of tho&s;e Punches in the Guts, which, tho' the Spectators at <HI>Brough|ton'</HI>s Amphitheatre have &s;uch exqui&s;ite Delight in Seeing them, convey but very little Plea&s;ure in the Feeling.</P>
<P>The lu&s;ty Youth had no &s;ooner received this Blow, than he meditated a mo&s;t grateful Return; and now en&s;ued a Combat between <HI>Jones</HI> and the Footman, which was very fierce, but &s;hort; for this Fellow was no more able to contend with <HI>Jones,</HI> than his Ma&s;ter had before been to contend with him.</P>
<P>And now Fortune, according to her u&s;ual Cu&s;tom, rever&s;ed the Face of Affairs, the former Victor lay breathle&s;s on the Ground, and the vanqui&s;hed Gentle|man had recovered Breath enough to thank Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> for his &s;ea&s;onable A&s;&s;i&s;tance: He received likewi&s;e the hearty Thanks of the young Woman pre&s;ent, who was indeed no other than Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy,</HI> the elde&s;t Daughter of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Footman having now recovered his Legs, &s;hook his Head at <HI>Jones,</HI> and with a &s;agacious Look, cry'd,&mdash;O d&mdash;n me, I'll have nothing more to do with you, you have been upon the Stage, or I am d&mdash;nably mi&s;taken: And indeed we may forgive this his Su&s;picion; for &s;uch was the Agility and Strength of our Heroe, that he was perhaps a Match for one of the fir&s;t Rate Boxers, and could with great Ea&s;e, have beaten all the muffled <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;t Po&s;terity &s;hould be puzzled by this Epithet, I think proper to explain it by an Adverti&s;ement which was publi&s;hed <HI>Feb.</HI> 1. 1747.

His Ma&s;ter foaming with Wrath, ordered his Man immediately to &s;trip, to which the latter very readily agreed, on Condition of receiving his Wages. This Condition was pre&s;ently complied with, and the Fel|low was di&s;charged.</P>
<P>And now the young Gentleman who&s;e Name was <HI>Nightingale,</HI> very &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted that his Deli|verer &s;hould take Part of a Bottle of Wine with him; to which <HI>Jones,</HI> after much Entreaty, con&s;ented; tho' more out of Complai&s;ance than Inclination; for the Unea&s;ine&s;s of his Mind fitted him very little for Conver&s;ation at this Time. Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy</HI> likewi&s;e, who was the only Female then in the Hou&s;e, her Mamma and Si&s;ter being gone to the Play, conde&s;cend|ed to favour them with her Company.</P>
<P>When the Bottle and Gla&s;&s;es were on the Table, the Gentleman began to relate the Occa&s;ion of the preceding Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope, Sir, &s;aid he to <HI>Jones,</HI> you will not, from this Accident, conclude, that I make a Cu&s;tom of &s;triking my Servants; for I a&s;&s;ure you this is the fir&s;t Time I have been guilty of it in my Remem|brance, and I have pa&s;&s;ed by many provoking Faults in this very Fellow, before he could pro|voke me to it; but when you hear what hath hap|pened this Evening, you will, I believe, think me

This, you will allow, was provoking; but I &s;aid nothing till the re&s;t of the hone&s;t Company were gone, and then gave the Fel|low a gentle Rebuke, who, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing any Concern, made me a pert An&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">'"That Servants mu&s;t have their Diver&s;ions as well as other People; that he was &s;orry for the Accident which had happened to the Book; but that &s;everal of his Acquaintance had bought the &s;ame for a Shilling; and that I might &s;top as much in his Wages if I plea&s;ed:"</Q> 'I now gave him a &s;everer Reprimand than before, when the Ra&s;cal had the In&s;olence to&mdash;In &s;hort he imputed my early coming Home to&mdash;In &s;hort, he ca&s;t a Reflection,&mdash;He men|tioned the Name of a young Lady, in a Manner&mdash;In &s;uch a Manner that incen&s;ed me be|yond all Patience, and in my Pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;truck him.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'That he believed no Per&s;on liv|ing would blame him; for my Part, &s;aid he, I con|fe&s;s I &s;hould on the la&s;t mentioned Provocation, have done the &s;ame Thing.'</Q></P>
<P>Our Company had not &s;at long before they were joined by the Mother and Daughter, at their Return from the Play. And now they all &s;pent a very chear|ful Evening together, for all but <HI>Jones</HI> were heartily merry, and even he put on as much con&s;trained Mirth as po&s;&s;ible. Indeed half his natural Flow of animal Spirits, joined to the Sweetne&s;s of his Temper, was &s;ufficient to make a mo&s;t amiable Companion; and notwith&s;tanding the Heavine&s;s of his Heart, &s;o agree|able did he make him&s;elf on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion,

that at their breaking up, the young Gentleman ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired his further Acquaintance. Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy</HI> was well plea&s;ed with him; and the Widow, quite charm'd with her new Lodger, invited him with the other, next Morning to Breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> on his Part, was no le&s;s &s;atisfied. As for Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy,</HI> tho' a very little Creature, &s;he was ex|tremely pretty, and the Widow had all the Charms which can adorn a Woman near fifty. As &s;he was one of the mo&s;t innocent Creatures in the World, &s;o &s;he was one of the mo&s;t chearful. She never thought, nor &s;poke, nor wi&s;hed any ill, and had con&s;tantly that De&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which may be called the happie&s;t of all De&s;ires in this, that it &s;carce ever fails of at|taining its Ends, when not di&s;graced by Affectation. In &s;hort, though her Power was very &s;mall, &s;he was in her Heart one of the warme&s;t Friends. She had been a mo&s;t affectionate Wife, and was a mo&s;t fond and tender Mother.</P>
<P>As our Hi&s;tory doth not, like a News-Paper, give great Characters to People who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again; the Reader may hence conclude, that this excellent Woman will hereafter appear to be of &s;ome Importance in our Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Nor was <HI>Jones</HI> a little plea&s;ed with the young Gentleman him&s;elf, who&s;e Wine he had been drink|ing. He thought he di&s;cerned in him much good Sen&s;e, though a little too much tainted with Town Fop|pery; but what recommended him mo&s;t to <HI>Jones</HI> were &s;ome Sentiments of great Genero&s;ity and Hu|manity, which occa&s;ionally dropt from him; and par|ticularly many Expre&s;&s;ions of the highe&s;t Di&s;intere&s;ted|ne&s;s in the Affair of Love. On which Subject the young Gentleman delivered him&s;elf in a Language which might have very well become an <HI>Arcadian</HI> Shepherd of Old, and which appeared very extraordinary when

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>What arrived while the Company were at Breakfa&s;t, with &s;ome Hints concerning the Government of Daughters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR Company brought together in the Morning the &s;ame good Inclinations towards each other, with which they had &s;eparated the Evening before; but poor <HI>Jones</HI> was extreme di&s;con&s;olate; for he had ju&s;t received Information from <HI>Partridge,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had left her Lodging, and that he could not learn whither &s;he was gone. This News highly affected him, and his Countenance, as well as his Be|haviour, in Defiance of all his Endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manife&s;t Indications of a di&s;order|ed Mind.</P>
<P>The Di&s;cour&s;e turned at pre&s;ent, as before, on Love; and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> again expre&s;&s;ed many of tho&s;e warm, generous, and di&s;intere&s;ted Senti|ments upon this Subject, which wi&s;e and &s;ober Men call romantic, but which wi&s;e and &s;ober Women ge|nerally regard in a better Light. Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> (for &s;o the Mrs. of the Hou&s;e was called) greatly approved the&s;e Sentiments; but when the young Gentleman appealed to Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy,</HI> &s;he an&s;wered only, <Q REND="inline">'That &s;he believed the Gentleman who had &s;poke the lea&s;t, was capable of feeling the mo&s;t.'</Q></P>
<P>This Compliment was &s;o apparently directed to <HI>Jones,</HI> that we &s;hould have been &s;orry had he pa&s;&s;ed it by unregarded. He made her indeed a very polite An|&s;wer, and concluded with an oblique Hint, that her own Silence &s;ubjected her to a Su&s;picion of the &s;ame
<PB N="27" REF="32">
Kind: For indeed &s;he had &s;carce opened her Lips ei|ther now, or the la&s;t Evening.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I am glad <HI>Nanny,</HI> &s;ays Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> the Gentle|man hath made the Ob&s;ervation; I prote&s;t I am al|mo&s;t of his Opinion. What can be the Matter with you Child? I never &s;aw &s;uch an Alteration. What is become of all your Gayety? Would you think, Sir, I u&s;ed to call her my little Prattler. She hath not &s;poke twenty Words this Week.'</Q></P>
<P>Here their Conver&s;ation was interrupted by the En|trance of a Maid-Servant, who brought a Bundle in her Hands, which, &s;he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'was delivered by a Por|ter for Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI>'</Q> She added, <Q REND="inline">'that the Man immediately went away, &s;aying, it required no An&s;wer.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Surprize on this Occa&s;ion, and declared it mu&s;t be &s;ome Mi&s;take: But the Maid per&s;i&s;ting that &s;he was certain of the Name, all the Women were de&s;irous of having the Bundle imme|diately opened; which Operation was at length per|formed by little <HI>Bet&s;y,</HI> with the Con&s;ent of Mr. <HI>Jones;</HI> and the Contents were found to be a Domino, a Ma&s;k, and a Ma&s;querade Ticket.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> was now more po&s;itive than ever, in a&s;&s;ert|ing, that the&s;e Things mu&s;t have been delivered by Mi&s;take; and Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> her&s;elf expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome Doubt, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'&s;he knew not what to think.'</Q> But when Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> was a&s;ked, he delivered a very different Opinion. <Q REND="inline">'All I can conclude from it, Sir,' &s;aid he, 'is, that you are a very happy Man: For I make no doubt but the&s;e were &s;ent you by &s;ome Lady whom you will have the Happine&s;s of meeting at the Ma&s;querade.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had not a &s;ufficient Degree of Vanity to en|tertain any &s;uch flattering Imagination; nor did Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> her&s;elf give much A&s;&s;ent to what Mr. <HI>Night|ingale</HI> had &s;aid, 'till Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy</HI> having lifted up the
<PB N="28" REF="33">
Domino, a Card dropt from the Sleeve, in which was written as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To Mr.</HI> Jones.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<L>The Queen of the Fairies &s;ends you this,</L>
<L>U&s;e her Favours not ami&s;s.</L>
</LETTER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy</HI> now both agreed with Mr. <HI>Nightingale;</HI> nay, <HI>Jones</HI> him&s;elf was almo&s;t per&s;uaded to be of the &s;ame Opinion. And as no other Lady but Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> he thought, knew his Lodging, he began to flatter him&s;elf with &s;ome Hopes that it came from her, and that he might po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ee his <HI>Sophia.</HI> The&s;e Hopes had &s;urely very little Foundation; but as the Conduct of Mr. <HI>Fitz|patrick,</HI> in not &s;eeing him according to her Promi&s;e, and in quitting her Lodgings, had been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived &s;ome faint Hopes, that &s;he (of whom he had formerly heard a very whim|&s;ical Character) might po&s;&s;ibly intend to do him that Service, in a &s;trange Manner, which &s;he declined do|ing by more ordinary Methods. To &s;ay the Truth, as nothing certain could be concluded from &s;o odd and uncommon an Incident, he had the greater Lati|tude to draw what imaginary Conclu&s;ions from it he plea&s;ed. As his Temper therefore was naturally &s;an|guine, he indulged it on this Occa&s;ion, and his Ima|gination worked up a thou&s;and Conceits, to favour and &s;upport his Expectations of meeting his dear <HI>So|phia</HI> in the Evening.</P>
<P>Reader, if thou ha&s;t any good Wi&s;hes towards me, I will fully repay them, by wi&s;hing thee to be po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of this &s;anguine Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind: Since, after having read much, and con&s;idered long on that Sub|ject of Happine&s;s which hath employed &s;o many great Pens, I am almo&s;t inclined to fix it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Temper; which puts us; in a Manner, out of the Reach of Fortune, and makes us happy with|out
<PB N="29" REF="34">
her A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Indeed the Sen&s;ations of Plea&s;ure it gives are much more con&s;tant, as well as much keener than tho&s;e which that blind Lady be&s;tows; Nature having wi&s;ely contrived, that &s;ome Satiety and Languor &s;hould be annexed to all our real Enjoy|ments, le&s;t we &s;hould be &s;o taken up by them, as to be &s;topt from further Pur&s;uits. I make no Manner of doubt but that, in this Light, we may &s;ee the ima|ginary future Chancellor ju&s;t called to the Bar, the Archbi&s;hop in Crape, and the Prime Mini&s;ter at the Tail of an Oppo&s;ition, more truly happy than tho&s;e who are inve&s;ted with all the Power and Profit of the&s;e re&s;pective Offices.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having now determined to go to the Ma&s;|querade that Evening, Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> offered to conduct him thither. The young Gentleman, at the &s;ame Time, offered Tickets to Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy</HI> and her Mother; but the good Woman would not accept them. She &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'She did not conceive the Harm which &s;ome People imagined in a Ma&s;querade; but that &s;uch extravagant Diver&s;ions were only proper for Per&s;ons of Quality and Fortune, and not for young Women who were to get their Living, and could, at be&s;t, hope to be married to a good Trade&s;man.'</Q></P>
<P>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'A Trade&s;man! cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> you &s;han't undervalue my <HI>Nancy.</HI> There is not a Nobleman upon Earth above her Merit.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'O fie! Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI>' an&s;wered Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> 'you mu&s;t not fill the Girl's Head with &s;uch Fancies: But if it was her good Luck (&s;ays the Mother with a Simper) to find a Gentleman of your generous Way of thinking, I hope &s;he would make a better Return to his Genero&s;ity, than to give her Mind up to ex|travagant Plea&s;ures. Indeed where young Ladies bring great Fortunes them&s;elves, they have &s;ome Right to in&s;i&s;t on &s;pending what is their own:
<PB N="30" REF="35">
and on that Account, I have heard the Gentlemen &s;ay, a Man has &s;ometimes a better Bargain with a poor Wife, than with a rich one.&mdash;But let my Daughters marry whom they will, I &s;hall en|deavour to make them Ble&s;&s;ings to their Hu&s;bands:&mdash;I beg, therefore, I may hear of no more Ma&s;querades. <HI>Nancy</HI> is, I am certain, too good a Girl to de&s;ire to go; for &s;he mu&s;t remember when you carried her thither la&s;t Year, it almo&s;t turned her Head, and &s;he did not return to her|&s;elf, or to her Needle, in a Month afterwards.'</Q></P>
<P>Though a gentle Sigh which &s;tole from the Bo&s;om of <HI>Nancy,</HI> &s;eemed to argue &s;ome &s;ecret Di&s;approbation of the&s;e Sentiments, &s;he did not dare openly to oppo&s;e them. For as this good Woman had all the Tender|ne&s;s, &s;o &s;he had pre&s;erved all the Authority of a Pa|rent; and as her Indulgence to the De&s;ires of her Children, was only re&s;trained, by her Fears for their Safety and future Welfare, &s;o &s;he never &s;uffered tho&s;e Commands, which proceeded from &s;uch Fears, to be either di&s;obeyed or di&s;puted. And this the young Gentleman who had lodged two Years in the Hou&s;e, knew &s;o well, that he pre&s;ently acquie&s;ced in the Refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> who grew every Minute fonder of <HI>Jones,</HI> was very de&s;irous of his Company that Day to Dinner at the Tavern, where he offered to intro|duce him to &s;ome of his Acquaintance; but <HI>Jones</HI> begged to be excu&s;ed, <Q REND="inline">'as his Cloaths, he &s;aid, were not yet come to Town.'</Q></P>
<P>To confe&s;s the Truth, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was now in a Situation, which &s;ometimes happens to be the Ca&s;e of young Gentlemen of much better Figure than him|&s;elf. In &s;hort, he had not one Penny in his Pocket; a Situation in much greater Credit among the ancient Philo&s;ophers, than among the modern wi&s;e Men who live in <HI>Lombard</HI> Street, or tho&s;e who frequent <HI>White'</HI>s
<PB N="31" REF="36">
Chocolate Hou&s;e. And, perhaps, the great Honours which tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers have a&s;cribed to an empty Pocket, may be one of the Rea&s;ons of that high Con|tempt in which they are held in the afore&s;aid Street and Chocolate-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Now if the antient Opinion, that Men might live very comfortably on Virtue only, be, as the modern wi&s;e Men ju&s;t above-mentioned pretend to have di&s;|covered, a notorious Error; no le&s;s fal&s;e is, I appre|hend, that Po&s;ition of &s;ome Writers of Romance, that a Man can live altogether on Love: For how|ever delicious Repa&s;ts this may afford to &s;ome of our Sen&s;es or Appetites, it is mo&s;t certain it can afford none to others. Tho&s;e, therefore, who have placed too great a Confidence in &s;uch Writers, have expe|rienced their Error when it was too late; and have found that Love was no more capable of allaying Hunger, than a Ro&s;e is capable of delighting the Ear, or a Violin of gratifying the Smell.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, therefore, all the Delicacies which Love had &s;et before him, namely, the Hopes of &s;ee|ing <HI>Sophia</HI> at the Ma&s;querade; on which, however ill-founded his Imagination might be, he had volup|tuou&s;ly fea&s;ted during the whole Day, the Evening no &s;ooner came, than Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> began to langui&s;h for &s;ome Food of a gro&s;&s;er Kind. <HI>Partridge</HI> di&s;co|vered this by Intution, and took the Occa&s;ion to give &s;ome oblique Hints concerning the Bank-bill, and when tho&s;e were rejected with Di&s;dain, he collected Courage enough once more to mention a Return to Mr. <HI>Allworthy.</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>'Partridge,</HI> cries <HI>Jones,</HI> you cannot &s;ee my Fortune in a more de&s;perate Light than I &s;ee it my|&s;elf; and I begin heartily to repent, that I &s;uffered you to leave a Place, where you was &s;ettled, and to follow me.

<P>When the two Gentlemen were both attired for the Ma&s;querade, and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> had given Or|ders for Chairs to be &s;ent for, a Circum&s;tance of Di&s;|tre&s;s occurred to <HI>Jones,</HI> which will appear very ridi|culous to many of my Readers.

<P>OUR Cavaliers now arrived at that Temple, where <HI>Heydegger,</HI> the great <HI>Arbiter Deliciarum,</HI> the great High-Prie&s;t of Plea&s;ure pre&s;ides; and, like other Heathen Prie&s;ts, impo&s;es on his Votaries by the pretended Pre&s;ence of the Deity, when in reality no &s;uch Deity is there.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> having taken a Turn or two with
<PB N="34" REF="39">
his Companion, &s;oon left him, and walked off with a Female, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Now you are here, Sir, you mu&s;t beat about for your own Game.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> began to entertain &s;trong Hopes that his <HI>So|phia</HI> was pre&s;ent; and the&s;e Hopes gave him more Spirits than the Lights, the Mu&s;ic, and the Compa|ny; though the&s;e are pretty &s;trong Antidotes again&s;t the Spleen. He now acco&s;ted every Woman he &s;aw, who&s;e Stature, Shape, or Air, bore any Re&s;emblance to his Angel. To all of whom he endeavoured to &s;ay &s;omething &s;mart, in order to engage an An&s;wer, by which he might di&s;cover that Voice which he thought it impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould mi&s;take. Some of the&s;e an&s;wered by a Que&s;tion, in a &s;queaking Voice, <HI>Do you know me?</HI> Much the greater Numbers &s;aid, <HI>I don't know you, Sir;</HI> and nothing more. Some called him an impertinent Fellow; &s;ome made him no An|&s;wer at all; &s;ome &s;aid, <HI>Indeed I don't know your Voice, and I &s;hall have nothing to &s;ay to you;</HI> and many gave him as kind An&s;wers as he could wi&s;h, but not in the Voice he de&s;ired to hear.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was talking with one of the&s;e la&s;t, (who was in the Habit of a Shepherde&s;s) a Lady in a Do|mino came up to him, and &s;lapping him on the Shoul|der, whi&s;pered him, at the &s;ame Time, in the Ear, <Q REND="inline">'If you talk any longer with that Trollop, I will acquaint Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> no &s;ooner heard that Name, than, immedi|ately quitting his former Companion, he applied to the Domino, begging and entreating her to &s;hew him the Lady &s;he had mentioned, if &s;he was then in the Room.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;k walked ha&s;tily to the upper end of the innermo&s;t Apartment before &s;he &s;poke, and then, in|&s;tead of an&s;wering him, &s;at down, and declared &s;he was tired. <HI>Jones</HI> &s;at down by her, and &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his Entreaties; at la&s;t the Lady coldly an&s;wered,
<PB N="35" REF="40">
<Q REND="inline">'I imagined Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> had been a more di&s;cerning Lover, than to &s;uffer any Di&s;gui&s;e to conceal his Mi&s;tre&s;s from him. Is &s;he here then, Madam? replied <HI>Jones,</HI> with much Vehemence.'</Q> Upon which the Lady cry'd,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Hu&s;h, Sir, you will be ob&s;erv|ed&mdash;I promi&s;e you, upon my Honour, Mi&s;s <HI>We|&s;tern</HI> is not here.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> now taking the Ma&s;k by the Hand, fell to entreating her in the mo&s;t earne&s;t Manner, to ac|quaint him where he might find <HI>Sophia:</HI> And when he could obtain no direct An&s;wer, he began to up|braid her gently for having di&s;appointed him the Day before; and concluded, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my good Fairy Queen, I know your Maje&s;ty very well, not|with&s;tanding the affected Di&s;gui&s;e of your Voice. Indeed, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> it is a little cruel to di|vert your&s;elf at the Expence of my Torments.'</Q></P>
<P>The Ma&s;k an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'Though you have &s;o inge|niou&s;ly di&s;covered me, I mu&s;t &s;till &s;peak in the &s;ame Voice, le&s;t I &s;hould be known by others.

Be&s;ides, I promi&s;e you, my Cou&s;in is not mad enough to con&s;ent to her own De&s;truction, if you are &s;o much her Ene|my as to tempt her to it.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Alas, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> you little know my Heart, when you call me an Enemy of <HI>Sophia.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'And yet to ruin any one, cries the other, you will allow, is the Act of an Enemy; and when by the &s;ame Act you mu&s;t knowingly and certainly bring Ruin on your&s;elf, is it not Folly or Madne&s;s, as well as Guilt? Now, Sir, my Cou&s;in hath very little more than her Father will plea&s;e to give her; very little for one of her Fa&s;hion,&mdash;you know him, and you know your own Situation.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="41">
<HI>Jones</HI> vowed he had no &s;uch De&s;ign on <HI>Sophia,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'That he would rather &s;uffer the mo&s;t violent of Deaths than &s;acrifice her Intere&s;t to his De&s;ires. He &s;aid, he knew how unworthy he was of her every Way; that he had long ago re&s;olved to quit all &s;uch a&s;piring Thoughts, but that &s;ome &s;trange Accidents had made him de&s;irous to &s;ee her once more, when he promi&s;ed he would take Leave of her for ever. No, Madam, concluded he, my Love is not of that ba&s;e Kind which &s;eeks its own Satisfaction, at the Expence of what is mo&s;t dear to its Object. I would &s;acrifice every Thing to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my <HI>Sophia,</HI> but <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>Though the Reader may have already conceived no very &s;ublime Idea of the Virtue of the Lady in the Ma&s;k; and tho' po&s;&s;ibly &s;he may hereafter appear not to de&s;erve one of the fir&s;t Characters of her Sex; yet, it is certain, the&s;e generous Sentiments made a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion upon her, and greatly added to the Affec|tion &s;he had before conceived for our young Heroe.</P>
<P>The Lady now, after a Silence of a few Moments, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'She did not &s;ee his Preten&s;ions to <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;o much in the Light of Pre&s;umption, as of Impru|dence. Young Fellows, &s;ays &s;he, can never have too a&s;piring Thoughts. I love Ambition in a young Man, and I would have you cultivate it as much as po&s;&s;ible. Perhaps you may &s;ucceed with tho&s;e who are infinitely &s;uperior in Fortune, nay, I am con|vinced there are Women,&mdash;but don't you think me a &s;tronge Creature, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> to be thus giv|ing Advice to a Man, with whom I am &s;o little acquainted, and one with who&s;e Behaviour to me I have &s;o little Rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed?'</Q></P>
<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> began to apologize, and to hope he had not offended in any thing he had &s;aid of her Cou&s;in. &mdash;To which the Ma&s;k an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'And are you &s;o little ver&s;ed in the Sex, to imagine you can well
<PB N="37" REF="42">
affront a Lady more, than by entertaining her with your Pa&s;&s;ion for another Woman? If the Fairy Queen had had no better Opinion of your Gallan|try, &s;he would &s;carce have appointed you to meet her at a Ma&s;querade.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had never le&s;s Inclination to an Amour than at pre&s;ent; but Gallantry to the Ladies was among his Principles of Honour; and he held it as much incum|bent on him to accept a Challenge to Love, as if it had been a Challenge to Fight. Nay, his very Love to <HI>Sophia</HI> made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to keep well with the Lady, as he made no doubt but &s;he was capable of bringing him into the Pre&s;ence of the other.</P>
<P>He began therefore to make a very warm An&s;wer to her la&s;t Speech, when a Ma&s;k in the Character of an old Woman, joined them. This Ma&s;k was one of tho&s;e Ladies who go to a Ma&s;querade only to vent Ill-nature, by telling People rude Truths, and by en|deavouring, as the Phra&s;e is, to &s;poil as much Sport as they are able. This good Lady therefore, having ob&s;erved <HI>Jones,</HI> and his Friend, whom &s;he well knew, in clo&s;e Con&s;ultation together in a Corner of the Room, concluded &s;he could no where &s;atisfy her Spleen better than by interrupting them. She attack|ed them therefore, and &s;oon drove them from their Retirement; nor was &s;he contented with this, but pur&s;ued them to every Place which they &s;hifted to avoid her; till Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> &s;eeing the Di&s;tre&s;s of his Friend, at la&s;t relieved him, and engaged the old Woman in another Pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>While <HI>Jones</HI> and his Ma&s;k were walking together about the Room, to rid them&s;elves of the Teazer, he ob&s;erved his Lady &s;peak to &s;everal Ma&s;ks, with the &s;ame Freedom of Acquaintance as if they had been barefaced. He could not help expre&s;&s;ing his Surpri&s;e at this, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Sure, Madam, you mu&s;t have in|finite Di&s;cernment to know People in all Di&s;gui&s;es.'</Q>
<PB N="38" REF="43">
To which the Lady an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'You cannot con|ceive any Thing more in&s;ipid and childi&s;h than a Ma&s;querade to the People of Fa&s;hion, who in ge|neral know one another as well here, as when they meet in an A&s;&s;embly or a Drawing-room; nor will any Woman of Condition conver&s;e with a Per&s;on with whom &s;he is not acquainted. In &s;hort, the Generality of Per&s;ons whom you &s;ee here, may more properly be &s;aid to kill Time in this Place, than in any other; and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longe&s;t Sermon. To &s;ay the Truth, I begin to be in that Situation my&s;elf, and if I have any Faculty at gue&s;&s;ing, you are not much better plea&s;ed. I prote&s;t it would be almo&s;t Charity in me to go Home for your Sake.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I know but one Charity equal to it, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> and that is to &s;uffer me to wait on you Home. Sure, an|&s;wered the Lady, you have a &s;trange opinion of me, to imagine, that upon &s;uch an Acquaintance, I would let you into my Doors at this Time o'Night. I fancy you impute the Friend&s;hip I have &s;hewn my Cou&s;in, to &s;ome other Motive. Confe&s;s hone&s;tly; don't you con&s;ider this contrived Interview as little better than a downright A&s;&s;ignation? Are you u&s;ed, Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> to make the&s;e &s;udden Conque&s;ts? I am not u&s;ed, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> to &s;ubmit to &s;uch &s;udden Conque&s;ts; but as you have taken my Heart by Surprize, the re&s;t of my Body hath a Right to follow; &s;o you mu&s;t pardon me if I re&s;olve to at|tend you wherever you go.'</Q> He accompanied the&s;e Words with &s;ome proper Actions; upon which the Lady, after a gentle Rebuke, and &s;aying their Fami|liarity would be ob&s;erved, told him, <Q REND="inline">'She was going to &s;up with an Acquaintance, whither &s;he hoped he would not follow her; for if you &s;hould, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall be thought an unaccountable Creature, though my Friend indeed is not cen&s;orious, yet I
<PB N="39" REF="44">
hope you won't follow me: I prote&s;t I &s;hall not know what to &s;ay, if you do.'</Q></P>
<P>The Lady pre&s;ently after quitted the Ma&s;querade, and <HI>Jones,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere Prohibition he had received, pre&s;umed to attend her. He was now reduced to the &s;ame Dilemma we have mentioned be|fore, namely, the want of Shilling, and could not relieve it by borrowing as before. He therefore walk|ed boldly on after the Chair in which his Lady rode, pur&s;ued by a grand Huzza from all the Chairmen pre&s;ent, who wi&s;ely take the be&s;t Care they can to di&s;countenance all walking afoot by their Betters. Luckily however the Gentry who attend at the Ope|ra-Hou&s;e were too bu&s;y to quit their Stations, and as the Latene&s;s of the Hour prevented him from meet|ing many of their Brethren in the Street, he proceed|ed without Mole&s;tation, in a Dre&s;s, which, at ano|ther Sea&s;on, would have certainly rai&s;ed a Mob at his Heels.</P>
<P>The Lady was &s;et down in a Street, not far from <HI>Hanover-Square,</HI> where the Door being pre&s;ently opened, &s;he was carried in, and the Gentleman, with|out any Ceremony, walked in after her.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> and his Companion were now together in a very well-furni&s;hed and well-warm'd Room, when the Female &s;till &s;peaking in her Ma&s;querade Voice, &s;aid, &s;he was &s;urprized at her Friend, who mu&s;t ab|&s;olutely have forgot her Appointment; at which after venting much Re&s;entment, &s;he &s;uddenly expre&s;t &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion from <HI>Jones,</HI> and a&s;ked him what the World would think of their having been alone toge|ther in a Hou&s;e at that Time of Night? But in&s;tead of a direct An&s;wer to &s;o important a Que&s;tion, <HI>Jones</HI> began to be very importunate with the Lady to un|ma&s;k, and at length having prevailed, there appeared not Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> but the Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> her&s;elf.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to give the particular Conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="40" REF="45">
which con&s;i&s;ted of very common and ordinary Oc|currences, and which la&s;ted from two till &s;ix o'Clock in the Morning. It is &s;ufficient to mention all of it that is any wi&s;e material to this Hi&s;tory. And this was a Promi&s;e that the Lady would endeavour to find out <HI>Sophia,</HI> and in a few Days bring him to an In|terview with her, on Condition that he would then take his Leave of her. When this was thoroughly &s;ettled, and a &s;econd Meeting in the Evening ap|pointed at the &s;ame Place, they &s;eparated; the Lady returned to her Hou&s;e, and <HI>Jones</HI> to his Lodgings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Containing a Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s, which will appear very extraordinary to mo&s;t of our Readers.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JONES</HI> having refre&s;hed him&s;elf with a few Hours Sleep, &s;ummoned <HI>Partridge</HI> to his Pre&s;ence; and delivering him a Bank Note of fifty Pounds, ordered him to go and change it. <HI>Partridge</HI> received this with &s;parkling Eyes, though when he came to reflect farther, it rai&s;ed in him &s;ome Su&s;picions not very ad|vantageous to the Honour of his Ma&s;ter; to the&s;e the dreadful Idea he had of the Ma&s;querade, the Di&s;gui&s;e in which his Ma&s;ter had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad all Night, contributed. In plain Language, the only Way he could po&s;&s;ibly find to account for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Note, was by Robbery; and, to confe&s;s the Truth, the Reader, unle&s;s he &s;hould &s;u&s;pect it was owing to the Genero|&s;ity of Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> can hardly imagine any other.</P>
<P>To clear therefore the Honour of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> and to do Ju&s;tice to the Liberality of the Lady, he had really received this Pre&s;ent from her, who, though &s;he did not give much in to the Hackney Charities of the Age, &s;uch as building Ho&s;pitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was not, how|ever, entirely void of that Chri&s;tian Virtue; and con|ceived
<PB N="41" REF="46">
(very righty I think) that a young Fellow of Merit, without a Shilling in the World, was no im|proper Object of this Virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> had been invited to dine this Day with Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> At the appointed Hour therefore the two young Gentlemen, with the two Girls, attended in the Parlour, where they waited from three till almo&s;t five before the good Woman appeared. She had been out of Town to vi&s;it a Relation, of whom, at her Return, &s;he gave the fol|lowing Account,</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I hope, Gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; I am &s;ure if you knew the Occa&s;ion.&mdash;I have been to &s;ee a Cou&s;in of mine, about &s;ix Miles off, who now lies in.&mdash;It &s;hould be a Warning to all Per&s;ons (&s;ays &s;he, looking at her Daughters) how they marry indi&s;creetly.

<P>It was not with dry Eyes that <HI>Jones</HI> heard this Nar|rative; when it was ended, he took Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> a|part with him into another Room, and delivering her his Pur&s;e, in which was the Sum of 50 <HI>l.</HI> de&s;ired her to &s;end as much of it as &s;he thought proper to the&s;e poor People.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Which treats of Matters of a very different Kind from tho&s;e in the preceding Chapter.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Evening <HI>Jones</HI> met his Lady again, and a long Conver&s;ation again en&s;ued between them; but as it con&s;i&s;ted only of the &s;ame ordinary Occur|rences as before, we &s;hall avoid mentioning Particu|lars, which we de&s;pair of rendring agreeable to the Reader; unle&s;s he is one who&s;e Devotion to the Fair Sex, like that of the Papi&s;ts to their Saints, wants to be rai&s;ed by the Help of Pictures. But I am &s;o far from de&s;iring to exhibit &s;uch Pictures to the Public, that I would wi&s;h to draw a Curtain over tho&s;e that have been lately &s;et forth in certain <HI>French</HI> Novels; very bungling Copies of which have been pre&s;ented us here, under the Name of Tran&s;lations.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> grew &s;till more and more impatient to &s;ee <HI>Sophia;</HI> and finding, after repeated Interviews with Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> no Likelihood of obtaining this by her Means; for, on the contrary, the Lady began to treat even the Mention of the Name of <HI>Sophia</HI> with Re&s;entment; he re&s;olved to try &s;ome other Method. He made no Doubt but that Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> knew where his Angel was, &s;o he thought it mo&s;t likely, that &s;ome of her Servants &s;hould be acquainted with the &s;ame Secret. <HI>Partridge</HI> therefore was employed to get acquainted with tho&s;e Servants, in order to fi&s;h this Secret out of them.</P>
<P>Few Situations can be imagined more unea&s;y than that to which his poor Ma&s;ter was at pre&s;ent reduced; for be&s;ides the Difficulties he met with in di&s;covering
<PB N="47" REF="52">
<HI>Sophia,</HI> be&s;ides the Fears he had of having di&s;obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er, and the A&s;&s;urances he had received from the Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> of the Re&s;olution which <HI>Sophia</HI> had taken a|gain&s;t him, and of her having purpo&s;ely concealed her&s;elf from him, which he had &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to believe might be true; he had &s;till a Difficulty to com|bat, which it was not in the Power of his Mi&s;tre&s;s to remove, however kind her Inclination might have been. This was the expo&s;ing of her to be di&s;in|herited of all her Father's E&s;tate, the almo&s;t inevit|able Con&s;equence of their coming together without a Con&s;ent, which he had no Hopes of ever obtaining.</P>
<P>Add to all the&s;e the many Obligations which Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> who&s;e violent Fondne&s;s we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; &s;o that by her Means he was now become one of the be&s;t dre&s;s'd Men a|bout Town; and was not only relieved from tho&s;e ri|diculous Di&s;tre&s;&s;es we have before mentioned, but was actually rai&s;ed to a State of Affluence, beyond what he had ever known.</P>
<P>Now though there are many Gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their Con&s;ciences to po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of the whole Fortune of a Woman, without making her any Kind of Return; yet to a Mind the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">roprietor of which doth not de&s;erve to be hang'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">othing is, I believe, more irk&s;ome than to &s;upport Love with Gratitude only; e&s;pecially where Inclina|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion pulls the Heart a contrary Way. Such was the unhappy Ca&s;e of <HI>Jones;</HI> for tho' the virtuous Love which he bore to <HI>Sophia,</HI> and which left very little Affection for any other Woman, had been entirely out of the Que&s;tion, he could never have been able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ave made an adequate Return to the generous Pa&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of this Lady, who had indeed been once an Ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ect of De&s;ire; but was now entered at lea&s;t into the Autumn of Life; though &s;he wore all the Gayety of Youth both in her Dre&s;s and Manner; nay, &s;he con|trived
<PB N="48" REF="53">
&s;till to maintain the Ro&s;es in her Cheeks; but the&s;e, like Flowers forced out of Sea&s;on by Art, had none of that lively blooming Fre&s;hne&s;s with which Na|ture, at the proper Time, bedecks her own Produc|tions. She had, be&s;ides, a certain Imperfection, which renders &s;ome Flowers, tho' very beautiful to the Eye, very improper to be placed in a Wilderne&s;s of Sweets, and what above all others is mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to the Breath of Love.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Jones</HI> &s;aw all the&s;e Di&s;couragements on the one Side, he felt his Obligations full as &s;trongly on the other; nor did he le&s;s plainly di&s;cern the ardent Pa&s;|&s;ion whence the&s;e Obligations proceeded, the extreme Violence of which if he failed to equal, he well knew the Lady would think him ungrateful; and, what is wor&s;e, he would have thought him&s;elf &s;o. He knew the tacit Con&s;ideration upon which all her Favours were conferred; and as his Nece&s;&s;ity obliged him to accept them, &s;o his Honour, he concluded, forced him to pay the Price. This therefore he re&s;olved to do, what|ever Mi&s;ery it co&s;t him, and to devote him&s;elf to her, from that great Principle of Ju&s;tice, by which the Laws of &s;ome Countries oblige a Debtor who is no otherwi&s;e capable of di&s;charging his Debt to become the Slave of his Creditor.</P>
<P>While he was meditating on the&s;e Matters, he re|ceived the following Note from the Lady.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'A very fooli&s;h, but a very perver&s;e Accident hath happened &s;ince our la&s;t Meeting, which makes it improper I &s;hould &s;ee you any more at the u&s;ual Place. I will, if po&s;&s;ible, contrive &s;ome other Place by To-morrow. In the mean Time, Adieu.'</Q></P>
<P>This Di&s;appointment, perhaps, the Reader may conclude was not very great; but if it was, he was quickly relieved; for in le&s;s than an Hour afterwards another Note was brought him from the &s;ame Hand, which contained as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="54">
<Q REND="inline">'I have altered my Mind &s;ince I wrote, a Change, which if you are no Stranger to the tendere&s;t of all Pa&s;&s;ions, you will not wonder at. I am now re|&s;olved to &s;ee you this Evening, at my own Hou&s;e, whatever may be the Con&s;equence. Come to me exactly at &s;even; I dine abroad, but will be at Home by that Time. A Day, I find, to tho&s;e that &s;incerely love &s;eems longer than I imagined.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If you &s;hould accidentally be a few Moments before me, bid them &s;hew you into the Drawing-Room.'</Q></P>
<P>To confe&s;s the Truth, <HI>Jones</HI> was le&s;s plea&s;ed with this la&s;t Epi&s;tle than he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from complying with the ear|ne&s;t Entreaties of Mr. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> with whom he had now contracted much Intimacy and Friend&s;hip. The&s;e Entreaties were to go with that young Gentle|man and his Company to a new Play, which was to be acted that Evening, and which a very large Party had agreed to damn, from &s;ome Di&s;like they had ta|ken to the Author, who was a Friend to one of Mr. <HI>Nightingale'</HI>s Acquaintance. And this Sort of Funn, our Heroe, we are a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, would willingly have preferred to the above kind Appointment; but his Honour got the better of his Inclination.</P>
<P>Before we attend him to this intended Interview with the Lady, we think proper to account for both the preceding Notes, as the Reader may po&s;&s;ibly be not a little &s;urprized at the Imprudence of Lady <HI>Bel|la&s;ton</HI> in bringing her Lover to the very Hou&s;e where her Rival was lodged.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e where the&s;e Lovers had hitherto met, and who had been for &s;ome Years a Pen&s;ioner to that Lady, was now become a Methodi&s;t, and had that very Morning waited upon her Lady&s;hip, and after rebuking her &s;everely for her pa&s;t Life, had po&s;itively declared, that &s;he would,
<PB N="50" REF="55">
on no Account, be in&s;trumental in carrying on any of her Affairs for the future.</P>
<P>The Hurry of Spirits into which this Accident threw the Lady, made her de&s;pair of po&s;&s;ibly finding any o|ther Convenience to meet <HI>Jones</HI> that Evening; but as &s;he began a little to recover from her Unea&s;ine&s;s at the Di&s;appointment, &s;he &s;et her Thoughts to work, when luckily it came into her Head to propo&s;e to <HI>Sophia</HI> to go to the Play, which was immediately con&s;ented to, and a proper Lady provided for her Companion. Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> was likewi&s;e di&s;patched with Mrs. <HI>Etoff</HI> on the &s;ame Errand of Plea&s;ure; and thus her own Hou&s;e was left free for the &s;afe Reception of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> with whom &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf two or three Hours of uninterrupted Conver&s;ation, after her Return from the Place where &s;he dined, which was at a Friend's Hou&s;e in a pretty di&s;tant Part of the Town, near her old Place of A&s;&s;ignation, where &s;he had en|gaged her&s;elf before &s;he was well apprized of the Re|volution that had happened in the Mind and Morals of her late Confidante.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> was ju&s;t dre&s;s'd to wait on Lady <HI>Bel|la&s;ton,</HI> when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> rapp'd at his Door; and being admitted, very earne&s;tly de&s;ired his Company below Stairs to drink Tea in the Parlour.</P>
<P>Upon his Entrance into the Room, &s;he pre&s;ently in|troduced a Per&s;on to him, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'This, Sir, is my Cou&s;in, who hath been &s;o greatly beholden to your Goodne&s;s, for which he begs to return you his &s;in|cere&s;t Thanks.'</Q></P>
<P>The Man had &s;carce entered upon that Speech, which Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had &s;o kindly prefaced, when both <HI>Jones</HI> and he looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at each other, &s;howed

at once the utmo&s;t Tokens of Surprize. The Voice of the latter began in&s;tantly to faulter; and, in&s;tead of fini&s;hing his Speech, he &s;unk down into a Chair, cry|ing, <Q REND="inline">'It is &s;o, I am convinced it is &s;o!'</Q></P>

<P>Here <HI>Jones</HI> attempted to prevent the poor Man from proceeding; but indeed the Overflowing of his own Heart would of it&s;elf have &s;topped his Words.

<P>The Hour of Appointment being now come, <HI>Jones</HI> was forced to take a ha&s;ty Leave, but not be|fore he had heartily &s;haken his Friend by the Hand, and de&s;ired to &s;ee him again as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; pro|mi&s;ing, that he would him&s;elf take the fir&s;t Opportu|nity of vi&s;iting him at his own Hou&s;e. He then &s;tept into his Chair, and proceeded to Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton'</HI>s, greatly exulting in the Happine&s;s which he had pro|cured to this poor Family; nor could he forbear re|flecting without Horror on the dreadful Con&s;equences which mu&s;t have attended them, had he li&s;tened ra|ther to the Voice of &s;trict Ju&s;tice, than to that of Mercy when he was attacked on the high Road.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> &s;ung forth the Prai&s;es of <HI>Jones</HI> during the whole Evening, in which Mr. <HI>Ender&s;on,</HI> while he &s;tayed, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately accompanied her, that he was often on the very Point of mentioning the Cir|cum&s;tances of the Robbery. However, he luckily recalled him&s;elf, and avoided an Indi&s;cretion which would have been &s;o much the greater, as he knew Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> to be extremely &s;trict and nice in her Principles. He was likewi&s;e well appri&s;ed of the Lo|quacity of this Lady; and yet &s;uch was his Gratitude, that it had almo&s;t got the better both of Di&s;cretion and Shame, and made him publi&s;h that which would have defamed his own Character, rather than omit any Circum&s;tances which might do the fulle&s;t Honour to his Benefactor.</P>

<P>MR. <HI>Jones</HI> was rather earlier than the Time ap|pointed, and earlier than the Lady, who&s;e Ar|rival was hindered not only by the Di&s;tance of the Place where &s;he dined, but by &s;ome other cro&s;s Ac|cidents, very vexatious to one in her Situation of Mind.

<P>To paint the Looks or Thoughts of either of the&s;e Lovers is beyond my Power. As their Sen&s;ations, from their mutual Silence, may be judged to have been too big for their Utterance, it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed,

Though I de&s;paired of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you, nay, almo&s;t of ever &s;eeing you more, I doated &s;till on your charming Idea, and could <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> love no other Woman.

Nay, even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my Love!'</Q> Nothing could equal <HI>Jones'</HI>s Sur|prize at the&s;e Words of <HI>Sophia;</HI> but yet, not being guilty, he was much le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed how to defend him&s;elf, than if &s;he had touched that tender String, at which his Con&s;cience had been alarmed. By &s;ome Examination he pre&s;ently found, that her &s;uppo&s;ing him guilty of &s;o &s;hocking an Outrage again&s;t his Love, and her Reputation, was entirely owing to <HI>Par|tridge'</HI>s Talk at the Inns, before Landlords and Ser|vants; for <HI>Sophia</HI> confe&s;&s;ed to him, it was from them that &s;he received her Intelligence. He had no very great Difficulty to make her believe that he was entire|ly innocent of an Offence &s;o foreign to his Character; but &s;he had a great deal to hinder him from going in|&s;tantly home, and putting <HI>Partridge</HI> to Death, which he more than once &s;wore he would do. This Point being cleared up, they &s;oon found them&s;elves &s;o well plea&s;ed with each other, that <HI>Jones</HI> quite forgot he had begun the Conver&s;ation with conjuring her to give up all Thoughts of him; and &s;he was in a Temper to have given Ear to a Petition of a very different Na|ture: For before they were aware, they had both gone &s;o far, that he let fall &s;ome Words that &s;ounded like a Propo&s;al of Marriage.

And when I am dead'</Q>&mdash;He would have gone on, but was &s;topt by a Flood of Tears which <HI>Sophia</HI> let fall in his Bo&s;om, upon which &s;he leaned, without being able to &s;peak one Word. He ki&s;&s;ed them off, which, for &s;ome Moments, &s;he allowed him to do without any Re&s;i&s;tance; but then recollecting her&s;elf, gently withdrew out of his Arms; and, to turn the Di&s;cour&s;e from a Subject too tender, and which &s;he found &s;he could not &s;upport, bethought her&s;elf to a&s;k him a Que&s;tion &s;he had never had Time to put to him before, <Q REND="inline">'How he came into that Room?'</Q> He begun to &s;tammer, and would, in all Probability, have rai&s;ed her Su&s;picions by the An&s;wer he was go|ing to give, when, at once, the Door opened, and in came Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>Having advanced a few Steps, and &s;eeing <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> together, &s;he &s;uddenly &s;topt; when after a Pau&s;e of a few Moments, recollecting her&s;elf with ad|mirable Pre&s;ence of Mind, &s;he &s;aid,&mdash;tho' with &s;uf|ficient Indications of Surprize both in Voice and Countenance&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I thought, Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> you had been at the Play?'</Q></P>
<P>Though <HI>Sophia</HI> had had no Opportunity of learn|ing of <HI>Jones,</HI> by what Means he had di&s;covered her, yet as &s;he had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of the real Truth, or that <HI>Jones</HI> and Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> were ac|quainted;
<PB N="59" REF="64">
&s;o &s;he was very little confounded: And the le&s;s, as the Lady had, in all their Conver&s;ations on the Subject, entirely taken her Side again&s;t her Father.

<P>The Length of this Narrative gave Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> an Opportunity of rallying her Spirits, and of con&s;i|dering in what Manner to act. And as the Behavi|our of <HI>Sophia</HI> gave her Hopes that <HI>Jones</HI> had not be|tray'd her, &s;he put on an Air of Good-Humour, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I &s;hould not have broke in &s;o abruptly upon you, Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> if I had known you had Com|pany.'</Q></P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> fixed her Eyes on <HI>Sophia</HI> whil&s;t &s;he &s;poke the&s;e Words. To which that poor young La|dy, having her Face over&s;pread with Blu&s;hes and Con|fu&s;ion, an&s;wered, in a &s;tammering Voice, <Q REND="inline">'I am &s;ure, Madam, I &s;hall always think the Honour of your Lady&s;hip's Company.</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I hope, at lea&s;t,' cries Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> 'I interrupt no Bu&s;ine&s;s.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'No, Madam, an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> our Bu&s;ine&s;s was at an End. Your Lady&s;hip may be plea&s;ed to re|member, I have often mentioned the Lo&s;s of my Pocket-Book, which this Gentleman having very luckily found, was &s;o kind to return to me with the Bill in it.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones,</HI> ever &s;ince the Arrival of Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> had been ready to &s;ink with Fear. He &s;at kicking his Heels, playing with his Fingers, and looking more like a Fool, if it be po&s;&s;ible, than a young boody Squire, when he is fir&s;t introduced into a polite A&s;|&s;embly. He began, however, now to recover him|&s;elf; and taking a Hint from the Behaviour of Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> who, he &s;aw, did not intend to claim any Acquaintance with him, he re&s;olved as entirely to affect the Stranger on his Part. He &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Ever &s;ince
<PB N="60" REF="65">
he had had the Pocket-Book in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he had u&s;ed great Diligence in enquiring out the Lady who&s;e Name was writ in it; but never till that Day could be &s;o fortunate to di&s;cover her.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> had, indeed, mentioned the Lo&s;s of her Pocket-Book to Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton;</HI> but as <HI>Jones,</HI> for &s;ome Rea&s;on or other, had never once hinted to her that it was in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he believed not one Syl|lable of what <HI>Sophia</HI> now &s;aid, and wonderfully ad|mired the extreme Quickne&s;s of the young Lady, in inventing &s;uch an Excu&s;e. The Rea&s;on of <HI>Sophia'</HI>s leaving the Play-hou&s;e met with no better Credit; and though &s;he could not account for the Meeting between the&s;e two Lovers, &s;he was firmly per&s;waded it was not accidental.</P>
<P>With an affected Smile, therefore, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'In|deed, Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> you have had very good Luck in recovering your Money.

<P><Q REND="inline">'O Madam, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> it was inclo&s;ed in a Pocket-Book, in which the young Lady's Name was written.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'That was very fortunate indeed, cries the Lady;&mdash;And it was no le&s;s &s;o, that you heard Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was at my Hou&s;e; for &s;he is very little known.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> had at length perfectly recovered his Spirits; and as he conceived he had now an Opportunity of &s;atisfying <HI>Sophia,</HI> as to the Que&s;tion &s;he had a&s;ked him ju&s;t before Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> came in, he proceed|ed thus: Why, Madam, an&s;wered he, <Q REND="inline">'it was by the luckie&s;t Chance imaginable I made this Di&s;co|very. I was mentioning what I had found, and

the Name of the Owner, the other Night, to a Lady at the Ma&s;querade, who told me, &s;he believ|ed &s;he knew where I might &s;ee Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> and if I would come to her Hou&s;e the next Morning, &s;he would inform me. I went according to her Appointment, but &s;he was not at Home; nor could I ever meet with her till this Morning, when &s;he directed me to your Lady&s;hip's Hou&s;e. I came ac|cordingly, and did my&s;elf the Honour to a&s;k for your Lady&s;hip; and upon my &s;aying that I had very particular Bu&s;ine&s;s, a Servant &s;hewed me into this Room; where I had not been long before the young Lady returned from the Play.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon his mentioning the Ma&s;querade, he look'd very &s;lyly at Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> without any Fear of be|ing remarked by <HI>Sophia;</HI> for &s;he was vi&s;ibly too much confounded to make any Ob&s;ervations. This Hint a little alarmed the Lady, and &s;he was &s;ilent; when <HI>Jones,</HI> who &s;aw the Agitations of <HI>Sophia'</HI>s Mind, re|&s;olved to take the only Method of relieving her, which was by retiring: But before he did this, he &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I believe, Madam, it is cu&s;tomary to give &s;ome Re|ward on the&s;e Occa&s;ions;&mdash;I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on a very high one for my Hone&s;ty;&mdash;It is, Madam, no le&s;s than the Honour of being permitted to pay ano|ther Vi&s;it here.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Sir, replied the Lady, I make no Doubt that you are a Gentleman, and my Doors are never &s;hut to People of Fa&s;hion.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> then, after proper Ceremonials, departed, highly to his own Satisfaction, and no le&s;s to that of <HI>Sophia;</HI> who was terribly alarmed le&s;t Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> &s;hould di&s;cover what &s;he knew already but too well.</P>
<P>Upon the Stairs <HI>Jones</HI> met his old Acquaintance Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding all &s;he had &s;aid again&s;t him, was now &s;o well-bred to behave with great Civility. This Meeting proved indeed a lucky

<P>AS &s;everal Gentlemen in the&s;e Times, by the wonderful Force of Genius only, without the lea&s;t A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Learning, perhaps, without being well able to read, have made a con|&s;iderable Figure in the Republic of Letters; the mo|dern Critics, I am told, have lately begun to a&s;&s;ert, that all kind of Learning is entirely u&s;ele&s;s to a Wri|ter; and, indeed, no other than a kind of Fetters on the natural Spriteline&s;s and Activity on the Imagina|tions, which is thus weighed down, and prevented

from &s;oaring to tho&s;e high Flights which otherwi&s;e it would be able to reach.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, I am afraid, is, at pre&s;ent, carried much too far: For why &s;hould Writing differ &s;o much from all other Arts? The Nimblene&s;s of a Dancing-Ma&s;ter is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move; nor doth any Mechanic, I believe, exer|ci&s;e his Tools the wor&s;e by knowing how to u&s;e them. For my own Part, I cannot conceive that <HI>Homer</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI> would have writ with more Fire, if, in&s;tead of being Ma&s;ters of all the Learning of their Times, they had really been as ignorant as mo&s;t of the Au|thors of the pre&s;ent Age. Nor do I believe that all the Imagination, Fire, and Judgment of <HI>Pitt</HI> could have produced tho&s;e Orations that have made the Se|nate of <HI>England</HI> in the&s;e our Times a Rival in Elo|quence to <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> if he had not been &s;o well read in the Writings of <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> and <HI>Ci|cero,</HI> as to have transfu&s;ed their whole Spirit into his Speeches, and with their Spirit, their Knowledge too.</P>
<P>I would not here be under&s;tood to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;ame Fund of Learning in any of my Brethren, as <HI>Cicero</HI> per&s;wades us is nece&s;&s;ary to the Compo&s;ition of an Orator. On the contrary, very little Reading is, I conceive, nece&s;&s;ary to the Poet, le&s;s to the Cri|tic, and the lea&s;t of all to the Politician. For the fir&s;t, perhaps, <HI>By&s;&s;e'</HI>s Art of Poetry, and a few of our mo|dern Poets, may &s;uffice; for the &s;econd, a moderate Heap of Plays; and for the la&s;t, an indifferent Col|lection of political Journals.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Truth, I require no more than that a Man &s;hould have &s;ome little Knowledge of the Sub|ject on which he treats, according to the old Maxim of Law, <HI>Quam qui&s;que norit artem in e&acirc; &s;e exer|ceat.</HI> With this alone a Writer may &s;ometimes do tolerably well; and indeed without this, all the other Learning in the World will &s;tand him in little &s;tead.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="73">
For In&s;tance, let us &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Virgil, Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Cicero, Thucydides</HI> and <HI>Livy</HI> could have met all together, and have clubbed their &s;everal Ta|lents to have compo&s;ed a Treati&s;e on the Art of Danc|ing; I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent Treati&s;e which Mr. <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> hath given us on that Subject, entitled, <HI>The Rudi|ments of genteel Education.</HI> And, indeed, &s;hould the excellent Mr. <HI>Broughton</HI> be prevailed on to &s;et <HI>Fi&s;t</HI> to Paper, and to complete the above&s;aid Rudiments, by delivering down the true Principles of Athletics, I que&s;tion whether the World will have any Cau&s;e to lament, that none of the great Writers, either an|cient or modern, have ever treated about that noble and u&s;eful Art.</P>
<P>To avoid a Multiplicity of Examples in &s;o plain a Ca&s;e, and to come at once to my Point, I am apt to conceive, that one Rea&s;on why many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wri|ters have totally failed in de&s;cribing the Manners of upper Life, may po&s;&s;ibly be, that in Reality they know nothing of it.</P>
<P>This is a Knowledge unhappily not in the Power of many Authors to arrive at. Books will give us a very imperfect Idea of it; nor will the Stage a much better: The fine Gentleman formed upon reading the former will almo&s;t always turn out a Pedant, and he who forms him&s;elf upon the latter, a Coxcomb.</P>
<P>Nor are the Characters drawn from the&s;e Models better &s;upported. <HI>Vanbrugh</HI> and <HI>Congreve</HI> copied Na|ture; but they who copy them draw as unlike the pre&s;ent Age, as <HI>Hogarth</HI> would do if he was to paint a Rout or a Drum in the Dre&s;&s;es of <HI>Titian</HI> and of <HI>Vandyke.</HI> In &s;hort, Imitation here will not do the Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Picture mu&s;t be after Nature her&s;elf. A true Knowledge of the World is gained only by Conver&s;ation, and the Manners of every Rank mu&s;t be &s;een in order to be known.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="74">
Now it happens that this higher Order of Mortals is not to be &s;een, like all the re&s;t of the Human Spe|cies, for nothing, in the Streets, Shops, and Coffee-hou&s;es: Nor are they &s;hewn, like the upper Rank of Animals, for &s;o much apiece. In &s;hort, this is a Sight to which no Per&s;ons are admitted, without one or o|ther of the&s;e Qualifications, <HI>viz.</HI> either Birth or For|tune; or what is equivalent to both, the honourable Profe&s;&s;ion of a Game&s;ter. And very unluckily for the World, Per&s;ons &s;o qualified, very &s;eldom care to take upon them&s;elves the bad Trade of Writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer Sort, as it is a Trade which many think re|quires no Kind of Stock to &s;et up with.</P>
<P>Hence tho&s;e &s;trange Mon&s;ters in Lace and Em|broidery, in Silks and Brocades, with va&s;t Wigs and Hoops; which, under the Name of Lords and Ladies, &s;trut the Stage, to the great Delight of Attornies and their Clerks in the Pit, and of Citizens and their Ap|prentices in the Galleries; and which are no more to be found in real Life, than the Centaur, the Chimera, or any other Creature of mere Fiction. But to let my Reader into a Secret, this Knowledge of upper Life, though very nece&s;&s;ary for the preventing Mi&s;|takes, is no very great Re&s;ource to a Writer who&s;e Province is Comedy, or that Kind of Novels, which like this I am writing, is of the comic Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>What Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;ays of Women is very applicable to mo&s;t in this Station, who are indeed &s;o entirely made up of Form and Affection, that they have no Character at all, at lea&s;t, none which appears. I will venture to &s;ay the highe&s;t Life is much the dulle&s;t, and affords very little Humour or Entertainment. The various Callings in lower Spheres produce the great Variety of humorous Characters; whereas here, ex|cept among the few who are engaged in the Pur&s;uit of Ambition, and the fewer &s;till who have a Reli&s;h for
<PB N="80" REF="75">
Plea&s;ure, all is Vanity and &s;ervile Imitation. Dre&s;&s;ing and Cards, eating and drinking, bowing and curte&s;ying, make up the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Lives.</P>
<P>Some there are however of this Rank, upon whom Pa&s;&s;ion exerci&s;es its Tyranny, and hurries them far beyond the Bounds which Decorum pre|&s;cribes; of the&s;e, the Ladies are as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their noble Intrepidity, and a certain &s;uperior Con|tempt of Reputation, from the frail ones of meaner Degree, as a virtuous Woman of Quality is by the Elegance and Delicacy of her Sentiments from the ho|ne&s;t Wife of a Yeoman or Shopkeeper. Lady <HI>Bel|la&s;ton</HI> was of this intrepid Character; but let not my Country Readers conclude from her, that this is the general Conduct of Women of Fa&s;hion, or that we mean to repre&s;ent them as &s;uch. They might as well &s;uppo&s;e, that every Clergyman was repre&s;ented by <HI>Thwackum,</HI> or every Soldier by En&s;ign <HI>Northerton.</HI></P>
<P>There is not indeed a greater Error than that which univer&s;ally prevails among the Vulgar, who borrow|ing their Opinion from &s;ome ignorant Satyri&s;ts, have affixed the Character of Lewdne&s;s to the&s;e Times. On the contrary, I am convinced there never was le&s;s of Love Intrigue carried on among Per&s;ons of Condi|tion, than now. Our pre&s;ent Women have been taught by their Mothers to fix their Thoughts only on Ambition and Vanity, and to de&s;pi&s;e the Plea&s;ures of Love as unworthy their Regard; and being afterwards, by the Care of &s;uch Mothers, married without having Hu&s;bands, they &s;eem pretty well confirmed in the Ju&s;t|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Sentiments; whence they content them|&s;elves for the dull Remainder of Life, with the Pur|&s;uit of more innocent, but I am afraid more childi&s;h Amu&s;ements, the bare Mention of which would ill &s;uit with the Dignity of this Hi&s;tory.

<P>The fir&s;t Thing however which he did in the Morn|ing was to write an An&s;wer to <HI>Sophia,</HI> which he en|clo&s;ed in one to <HI>Honour.</HI> He then di&s;patched another to Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> containing the abovementioned Excu&s;e; and to this he &s;oon received the following An&s;wer.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline">'You mu&s;t know, Sir, though I am now re|duced to get my Living by letting Lodgings, I was born and bred a Gentlewoman.

<P>There is a Kind of Sympathy in hone&s;t Minds, by Means of which they give an ea&s;y Credit to each o|ther.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was at length prevailed on, and <HI>Jones</HI> departed to his Chamber, where he &s;at alone till Twelve o'Clock, but no Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> appeared.</P>

<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> never once interrupted the Narration, though he di&s;covered violent Emotions at many Parts of it.

Her Intere&s;t alone, and not yours, ought to be your &s;ole Con&s;ideration. But if you a&s;k me what you &s;hall do; what can you do le&s;s,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> 'than to fulfil the Expec|tations of her Family, and her own. Nay, and I &s;incerely tell you, they were mine too, ever &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw you together. You will pardon me, if I pre&s;ume on the Friend&s;hip you have favoured me with, moved as I am with Compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e poor Creatures.

of this Kind, you will give me leave to examine it. Can you, with Honour, be guilty of having, under fal&s;e Pretences, deceived a young Woman and her Family, and of having, by the&s;e Means, treacherou&s;ly robbed her of her Innocence? Can you, with Honour, be the knowing, the wilful, nay, I mu&s;t add, the artful Contriver of the Ruin of a Human Being? Can you, with Honour, de|&s;troy the Fame, the Peace, nay, probably, both the Life and Soul too of this Creature? Can Ho|nour bear the Thought, that this Creature is a ten|der, helple&s;s, defencele&s;s young Woman? A young Woman who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who hath placed the utmo&s;t Confidence in your Promi&s;es; and to that Confidence hath &s;acri|ficed every Thing which is dear to her?

<P><Q REND="inline">'Common Sen&s;e, indeed,' &s;aid <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'war|rants all you &s;ay; but yet you well know the Opi|nion of the World is &s;o much the contrary, that was I to marry a Whore, tho' my own, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of ever &s;howing my Face again.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Fie upon it, Mr. <HI>Nightingale,'</HI> &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> 'do not call her by &s;o ungenerous a Name: When you promi&s;ed to marry her, &s;he became your Wife, and &s;he hath &s;inned more again&s;t Prudence than Virtue.

Forgive me, if I &s;ay &s;uch a Shame mu&s;t proceed from fal&s;e Mode&s;ty, which always attends fal&s;e Honour as its Shadow.&mdash;But I am well a&s;|&s;ured there is not a Man of real Sen&s;e and Goodne&s;s in the World, who would not honour and applaud the Action.

On the one Side, &s;ee this poor, unhappy, tender, believ|ing Girl, in the Arms of her wretched Mother, breathing her la&s;t. Hear her breaking Heart in Agonies &s;ighing out your Name; and lamenting, ra|ther than accu&s;ing, the Cruelty which weighs her down to De&s;truction. Paint to your Imagination the Circum&s;tances of her fond, de&s;pairing Parent, driven to Madne&s;s, or, perhaps, to Death, by the Lo&s;s of her lovely Daughter. View the poor, help|le&s;s, Orphan-Infant: And when your Mind hath dwelt a Moment only on &s;uch Ideas, con&s;ider your|&s;elf as the Cau&s;e of all; the Ruin of this poor, lit|tle, worthy, defencele&s;s Family. On the other Side, con&s;ider your&s;elf as relieving them from their tem|porary Sufferings. Think with what Joy, with what Tran&s;ports, that lovely Creature will fly to your Arms. See her Blood returning to her pale Cheeks, her Fire to her languid Eyes, and Raptures to her tortured Brea&s;t. Con&s;ider the Exultations of her Mother, the Happine&s;s of all. Think of this little Family made, by one Act of yours, complete|ly happy. Think of this Alternative, and &s;ure I am mi&s;taken in my Friend, if it requires any long Deli|beration, whether he will &s;ink the&s;e Wretches down for ever, or, by one generous, noble Re&s;olution, rai&s;e them all from the Brink of Mi&s;ery and De|&s;pair, to the highe&s;t Pitch of human Happine&s;s. Add to this but one Con&s;ideration more; the Con&s;idera|tion that it is your Duty &s;o to do&mdash;That the Mi|&s;ery from which you will relieve the&s;e poor People, is the Mi&s;ery which you your&s;elf have wilfully brought upon them.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'O my dear Friend,' cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'I wanted not your Eloquence to rou&s;e me. I pity poor <HI>Nan|cy</HI>

from my Soul, and would willingly give any Thing in my Power, that no Familiarities had ever pa&s;&s;ed between us. Nay, believe me, I had many Struggles with my Pa&s;&s;ion, before I could prevail with my&s;elf to write that cruel Letter, which hath cau&s;ed all the Mi&s;ery in that unhappy Family. If I had no Inclinations to con&s;ult but my own, I would marry her Tomorrow Morning; I would, by Hea|ven; but you will ea&s;ily imagine how impo&s;&s;ible it would be to prevail on my Father to con&s;ent to &s;uch a Match; be&s;ides, he hath provided another for me; and Tomorrow, by his expre&s;s Command, I am to wait on the Lady.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I have not the Honour to know your Father,' &s;aid <HI>Jones;</HI> 'but &s;uppo&s;e he could be per&s;uaded, would you your&s;elf con&s;ent to the only Means of pre&s;erv|ing the&s;e poor People?' 'As eagerly as I would pur&s;ue my Happine&s;s,' an&s;wered <HI>Nightingale;</HI> 'for I never &s;hall find it in any other Woman.&mdash;O my dear Friend, could you imagine what I have felt within the&s;e twelve Hours for my poor Girl, I am convinced &s;he would not engro&s;s all your Pity. Pa&s;&s;ion leads me only to her; and if I had any fool|i&s;h Scruples of Honour, you have fully &s;atisfied them: Could my Father be induced to comply with my De&s;ires, nothing would be wanting to compleat my own Happine&s;s, or that of my <HI>Nancy.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Then I am re&s;olved to undertake it,' &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> 'You mu&s;t not be angry with me, in whatever Light it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et this Affair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwi&s;e be long hid from him; for Things of this Nature make a quick Progre&s;s, when once they get abroad, as this un|happily hath already. Be&s;ides, &s;hould any fatal Ac|cident follow, as upon my Soul I am afraid will, unle&s;s immediately prevented, the Public would ring of your Name, in a Manner which, if your Father

hath common Humanity, mu&s;t offend him. If you will therefore tell me where I may find the old Gen|tleman, I will not loo&s;e a Moment in the Bu&s;ine&s;s; which while I pur&s;ue, you cannot do a more gene|reous Action, than by paying a Vi&s;it to the poor Girl. You will find I have not exaggerated in the Account I have given of the Wretchedne&s;s of the Family.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> immediately con&s;ented to the Propo&s;al; and now having acquainted <HI>Jones</HI> with his Father's Lodging, and the Coffee-hou&s;e where he would mo&s;t probably find him, he he&s;itated a Moment, and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'My dear <HI>Tom,</HI> you are going to undertake an Impo&s;&s;ibility. If you knew my Father, you would never think of obtaining his Con&s;ent.&mdash;Stay, there is one Way&mdash;Suppo&s;e you told him I was already married, it might be ea&s;ier to reconcile him to the Fact after it was done; and, upon my Honour, I am &s;o affected with what you have &s;aid, and I love my <HI>Nancy</HI> &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, I almo&s;t wi&s;h it was done, whatever might be the Con&s;equence.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> greatly approved the Hint, and promi&s;ed to pur&s;ue it. They then &s;eparated, <HI>Nightingale</HI> to vi|&s;it his <HI>Nancy,</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> in que&s;t of the old Gentleman.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>What pa&s;&s;ed between</HI> Jones <HI>and old Mr.</HI> Nightingale, <HI>with the Arrival of a Per&s;on not yet mentioned in this Hi&s;tory.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the Sentiment of the <HI>Roman</HI> Sa|tyri&s;t, which denies the Divinity of Fortune; and the Opinion of <HI>Seneca</HI> to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; <HI>Ci|cero,</HI> who was, I believe, a wi&s;er Man than either of them, expre&s;ly holds the contrary; and certain it is there are &s;ome Incidents in Life &s;o very &s;trange and unaccountable, that it &s;eems to require more than hu|man Skill and Fore&s;ight in producing them.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="110">
Of this Kind was what now happened to <HI>Jones,</HI> who found Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> the elder in &s;o critical a Minute, that Fortune, if &s;he was really worthy all the Wor&s;hip &s;he received at <HI>Rome,</HI> could not have con|trived &s;uch another. In &s;hort the old Gentleman and the Father of the young Lady whom he intended for his Son, had been hard at it for many Hours; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">atter was ju&s;t now gone, and had left the former de|lighted with the Thoughts that he had &s;ucceeded in a long Contention which had been between the two Fa|thers of the future Bride and Bridegroom; in which both endeavoured to over-reach the other, and as not rarely happens in &s;uch Ca&s;es, both had retreated fully &s;atisfied of having obtained the Victory.</P>
<P>This Gentleman whom Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> now vi&s;ited, was what they call a Man of the World, that is to &s;ay, a Man who directs his Conduct in this World, as one who being fully per&s;uaded there is no other, as re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of this. In his early Years he had been bred to Trade, but having acquired a very good Fortune, he had lately declined his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; or to &s;peak more properly, had changed it from dealing in Goods to dealing only in Money, of which he had always a plentiful Fund at Command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful Advantage; &s;ometimes of the Nece&s;&s;ities of private Men, and &s;ometimes tho&s;e of the Public. He had indeed conver&s;ed &s;o entirely with Money, that it may be almo&s;t doubted, whether he imagined there was any other thing really exi&s;ting in the World; this at lea&s;t may be certainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing el&s;e to have any real Value.</P>
<P>The Reader will, I fancy, allow, that Fortune could not have culled out a more improper Per&s;on for Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to attack with any Probability of Succe&s;s, nor could the whim&s;ical Lady have directed this At|tack at a more un&s;ea&s;onable Time.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="111">
As Money then was always uppermo&s;t in this Gen|tleman's Thoughts, &s;o the Moment he &s;aw a Stranger within his Doors, it immediately occurred to his Ima|gination, that &s;uch Stranger was either come to bring him Money, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of the&s;e Thoughts prevailed, he con|ceived a favourable or unfavourable Idea of the Per&s;on who approached him.</P>
<P>Unluckily for <HI>Jones,</HI> the latter of the&s;e was the A&s;cendant at pre&s;ent; for as a young Gentleman had vi&s;ited him the Day before, with a Bill from his Son for a Play Debt, he apprehended at the fir&s;t Sight of <HI>Jones,</HI> that he was come on &s;uch another Errand. <HI>Jones</HI> therefore had no &s;ooner told him that he was come on his Son's Account, than the old Gentleman, being confirmed in his Su&s;picion, bur&s;t forth into an Exclamation, 'That he would lo&s;e his Labour.' <Q REND="inline">'Is it then po&s;&s;ible, Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> 'that you can gue&s;s my Bu&s;ine&s;s?' If I do gue&s;s it, replied the o|ther, I repeat again to you, you will lo&s;e your La|bour. What, I &s;uppo&s;e you are one of tho&s;e Sparks who lead my Son into all tho&s;e Scenes of Riot and Debauchery, which will be his De&s;truction; but I &s;hall pay no more of his Bills I promi&s;e you. I ex|pect he will quit all &s;uch Company for the future. If I had imagined otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have pro|vided a Wife for him; for I would be in&s;trumental in the Ruin of no Body.' 'How, Sir, &s;aid <HI>Jones,</HI> and was this Lady of your providing?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Pray Sir,' an|&s;wered the old Gentleman, 'how comes it to be any Concern of yours?'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Nay, dear Sir,' replied <HI>Jones,</HI> 'be not offended that I intere&s;t my&s;elf in what regards your Son's Happine&s;s, for whom I have &s;o great an Honour and Value. It was upon that very Account I came to wait upon you. I can't expre&s;s the Satisfaction you have given me by what you &s;ay for I do a&s;&s;ure you your Son is a Per&s;on for whom
<PB N="107" REF="112">
I have the highe&s;t Honour.&mdash;Nay, Sir, it is not ea&s;y to expre&s;s the E&s;teem I have for you, who could be &s;o generous, &s;o good, &s;o kind, &s;o indulgent to provide &s;uch a Match for your Son; a Woman who, I dare &s;wear, will make him one of the hap|pie&s;t Men upon Earth.'</Q></P>
<P>There is &s;carce any thing which &s;o happily introduces Men to our good Liking, as having conceived &s;ome Alarm at their fir&s;t Appearance; when once tho&s;e Ap|prehen&s;ions begin to vani&s;h, we &s;oon forget the Fears which they occa&s;ion, and look on our&s;elves as indebt|ed for our pre&s;ent Ea&s;e, to tho&s;e very Per&s;ons who at fir&s;t rais'd our Fears.</P>
<P>Thus it happened to <HI>Nightingale,</HI> who no &s;ooner found that <HI>Jones</HI> had no Demand on him, as he &s;u|&s;pected, than he began to be plea&s;ed with his Pre&s;ence. <Q REND="inline">'Pray, good Sir, &s;aid he, be plea&s;ed to &s;it down. I do not remember to have ever had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you before; but if you are a Friend of my Son, and have any thing to &s;ay concerning this young Lady, I &s;hall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy, it will be his own Fault if &s;he doth not. I have di&s;charged my Duty, in taking Care of the main Article. She will bring him a Fortune capable of making any rea&s;onable, prudent, &s;ober Man happy.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Undoubtedly, cries <HI>Jones,</HI> for &s;he is in her&s;elf a Fortune; &s;o beautiful, &s;o genteel, &s;o &s;weet-tempered, and &s;o well educated; &s;he is in|deed a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young Lady; &s;ings admi|rably well, and hath a mo&s;t delicate Hand at the Harp&s;ichord.' 'I did not know any of the&s;e Matters, an&s;wered the old Gentleman, for I never &s;aw the the Lady; but I do not like her the wor&s;e for what you tell me; and I am the better plea&s;ed with her Father for not laying any Stre&s;s on the&s;e Qualificati|ons in our Bargain. I &s;hall always think it a Proof of his Under&s;tanding. A &s;illy Fellow would have
<PB N="108" REF="113">
brought in the&s;e Articles as an Addition to her For|tune; but to give him his due, he never mentioned any &s;uch Matter; though to be &s;ure they are no Di|&s;paragements to a Woman.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir,' cries <HI>Jones,</HI> '&s;he hath them all in the mo&s;t eminent Degree: For my Part I own I was afraid you might have been a little backward, a little le&s;s inclined to the Match: For your Son told me you had never &s;een the Lady, therefore I came, Sir, in that Ca&s;e, to entreat you, to conjure you, as you value the Happine&s;s of your Son, not to beaver&s;e to his Match with a Woman who hath not only all the good Qua|lities I have mentioned, but many more.'</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'If that was your Bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir, &s;aid the old Gentleman, we are both obliged to you; and you may be per|fectly ea&s;y, for I give you my Word I was very well &s;atisfied with her Fortune.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Sir,' an&s;wered <HI>Jones,</HI> I honour you every Moment more and more.

<P>With this Woman he had, during twenty-five Years, lived a Life more re&s;embling the Model which certain Poets a&s;cribe to the Golden Age, than any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e Patterns which are furni&s;hed by the pre&s;ent Times.

<P>The young Lady whom Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> had in|tended for his Son was a near Neighbour of his Bro|ther, and an Acquaintance of his Niece; and in reali|ty it was upon the Account of this projected Match, that he was now come to Town; not indeed to for|ward, but to di&s;&s;uade his Brother from a Purpo&s;e which he conceived would inevitably ruin his Nephew; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> fore&s;aw no other Event, from a Union with Mi&s;s <HI>Har|ris,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Largene&s;s of her Fortune, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> neither her Per&s;on nor Mind &s;eemed to him to promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> any Kind of matrimonial Felicity; for &s;he was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very &s;illy and very ill-natured.</P>
<P>His Brother therefore no &s;ooner mentioned the Mar|riage of his Nephew with Mi&s;s <HI>Miller,</HI> than he ex|pre&s;t
<PB N="111" REF="116">
the utmo&s;t Satisfaction; and when the Father had very bitterly reviled his Son, and pronounced Sen|tence of Beggary upon him, the Uncle began in the following Manner.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'If you was a little cooler, Brother, I would a&s;k you whether you love your Son for his Sake, or for your own.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Now, Brother, to pre&s;cribe Rules of Happine&s;s to others, hath always appeared to me very ab&s;urd, and to in&s;i&s;t on doing this very tyrannical.

<P><Q REND="inline">'It is, however, true, that though a Parent will not, I think, wi&s;ely pre&s;cribe, he ought to be con|&s;ulted on this Occa&s;ion, and in Strictne&s;s perhaps &s;hould at lea&s;t have a negative Voice. My Nephew therefore, I own, in marrying without a&s;king your Advice, hath been guilty of a Fault. But hone&s;tly &s;peaking, Brother, have you not a little promoted this Fault? Have not your frequent Declarations on this Subject, given him a moral Certainty of your Refu&s;al, where there was any Deficiency in Point of Fortune? nay, doth not your pre&s;ent Anger a|ri&s;e &s;olely from that Deficiency?

Will you encrea&s;e the ill Con&s;equences of his &s;imple Choice? Will you endeavour to make an Event certain Mi&s;ery to him, which may accidentally prove &s;o?

<P>THERE are a Set of Religious, or rather Mo+ral Writers, who teach that Virtue is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> certain Road to Happine&s;s, and Vice to Mi+&s;ery in this World.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>In which is opened a very black De&s;ign again&s;t</HI> Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>I Remember a wi&s;e old Gentleman, who u&s;ed to &s;ay, when Children are doing nothing, they are doing Mi&s;chief. I will not enlarge this quaint Say|ing to the mo&s;t beautiful Part of the Creation in ge|neral: but &s;o far I may be allowed, that when the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Effects of female Jealou&s;y do not appear openly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> their proper Colours of Rage and Fury, we may &s;u&s;|pect that mi&s;chievous Pa&s;&s;ion to be at work privately and attempting to undermine, what it doth not attack above-ground.</P>
<P>This was exemplified in the Conduct of the Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> who under all the Smiles which &s;he wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in her Countenance, concealed much Indignation a|gain&s;t <HI>Sophia;</HI> and as &s;he plainly &s;aw that this young Lady &s;tood between her and the full Indulgence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her De&s;ires, &s;he re&s;olved to get rid of her by &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Means or other; nor was it long before a very favour+able Opportunity of accompli&s;hing this, pre&s;ented it+&s;elf to her.</P>
<P>The Reader may be plea&s;ed to remember, that whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Sophia</HI> was thrown into that Con&s;ternation at the Play hou&s;e, by the Wit and Humour of a Set of young Gentlemen, who call them&s;elves the Town, we inform+ed him, that &s;he had put her&s;elf under the Protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a young Nobleman, who had very &s;afely conduct+ed her to her Chair.</P>
<P>This Nobleman, who frequently vi&s;ited Lady <HI>Bel+la&s;ton,</HI> had more than once &s;een <HI>Sophia</HI> there, &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> her Arrival in Town, and had conceived a very grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> liking to her; which Liking, as Beauty never look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> more amiable than in Di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Sophia</HI> had in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">

<P>It may ea&s;ily be believed that he would not &s;uffer &s;o hand&s;ome an Occa&s;ion of improving his Acquain|tance with the beloved Object as now offered it&s;elf to elap&s;e, when good-breeding alone might have prompt|ed him to pay her a Vi&s;it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>A further Explanation of the foregoing De&s;ign.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO' the Reader may have long &s;ince concluded Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> to be a Member (and no in|con&s;iderable one) of the Great World, &s;he was in reality a very con&s;iderable Member of <HI>the Little World;</HI> by which Appellation was di&s;tingui&s;hed a very worthy and honourable Society which not long &s;ince flouri&s;hed in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Among other good Principles upon which this So|ciety was founded, was one very remarkable; for as it was a Rule of an honourable Club of Heroes, who a&s;&s;embled at the clo&s;e of the late War, that all the Members &s;hould every Day fight once at lea&s;t; &s;o 'twas in this, that every Member &s;hould, within the twenty four Hours, tell at lea&s;t one merry Fib, which was to be propagated by all the Brethren and Si&s;ter|hood.</P>
<P>Many idle Stories were told about this Society, which from a certain Quality may be perhaps not unju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to have come from the Society them|&s;elves. As, that the Devil was the Pre&s;ident, and that he &s;at in Per&s;on in an elbow Chair at the upper End of the Table; but upon very &s;trict Enquiry, I find there is not the lea&s;t Truth in any of tho&s;e Tales, and that the A&s;&s;embly con&s;i&s;ted in reality of a Set of very good &s;ort of People, and the Fibs which they propagated were of a harmle&s;s Kind, and tended only to produce Mirth and good Humour.</P>
<P><HI>Edwards</HI> was likewi&s;e a Member of this comical Society. To him therefore Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> applied as a proper In&s;trument for her Purpo&s;e, and furni&s;hed him with a Fib, which he was to vent whenever the Lady gave him her Cue; and this was not to be till
<PB N="139" REF="134">
the Evening when all the Company but Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> and him&s;elf were gone, and while they were engaged in a Rubbers at Whi&s;t.</P>
<P>To this Time then, which was between &s;even and eight in the Evening, we will convey our Reader; when Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> being engaged at Whi&s;t, and in the la&s;t Game of their Rubbers, <HI>Tom</HI> received his Cue from Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> which was, I prote&s;t <HI>Tom,</HI> you are grown intolerable lately; you u&s;ed to tell us all the News of the Town, and now you know no more of the World than if you lived out of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> then began as follows: <Q REND="inline">'The Fault is not mine, Madam; It lies in the Dulne&s;s of the Age that doth nothing worth talking Of&mdash;O la! tho' now I think on't, there hath a terrible Accident be|fallen poor Col. <HI>Wilcox.&mdash;</HI>Poor <HI>Ned&mdash;</HI>You know him my Lord, every body knows him; faith!

<P><Q REND="inline">'Why, he hath killed a Man this Morning in a Duel, that's all.'</Q></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip, who was not in the Secret, a&s;ked gravely, whom he had killed; to which <HI>Edwards</HI> an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'A young Fellow we none of us know; a <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> Lad ju&s;t come to town, one <HI>Jones</HI> his Name is; a near Relation of one Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> of whom your Lord&s;hip I believe hath heard.

<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> who ju&s;t began to deal as <HI>Tom</HI> had menti|oned that a Man was killed, &s;topt her Hand, and li&s;|tened with Attention, (for all Stories of that Kind affected her) but no &s;ooner had he arrived at the latter part of the Story, than &s;he began to deal again; and having dealt three Cards to one, and &s;even to another,

The u&s;ual Di&s;turbance en&s;ued, the u&s;ual A&s;|&s;i&s;tance was &s;ummoned, and <HI>Sophia</HI> at la&s;t, as it is u|&s;ual, returned again to Life, and was &s;oon after, at her earne&s;t De&s;ire, led to her own Apartment; where, at my Lord's Reque&s;t, Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> acquainted her with the Truth, attempted to carry it off as a Je&s;t of her own, and comforted her with repeated A&s;&s;urances, that neither his Lord&s;hip, nor <HI>Tom,</HI> though &s;he had taught him the Story, were in the true Secret of the Affair.</P>
<P>There was no farther Evidence nece&s;&s;ary to con|vince Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> how ju&s;tly the Ca&s;e had been re|pre&s;ented to him by Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton;</HI> and now at her Return into the Room, a Scheme was laid between tho&s;e two noble Per&s;ons, which, though it appeared in no very heinous Light to his Lord&s;hip, (as he faithfully promi&s;ed, and faithfully re&s;olved too, to make the Lady all the &s;ub&s;equent amends in his Power by Marriage;) yet many of our Readers, we doubt not, will &s;ee with ju&s;t Dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>The next Evening at &s;even was appointed for the fatal Purpo&s;e, when Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> undertook that <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;hould be alone, and his Lord&s;hip &s;hould be in|troduced to her. The whole Family were to be regu|lated for the Purpo&s;e, mo&s;t of the Servants di&s;patched out of the Hou&s;e, and for Mrs. <HI>Honour</HI> who, to pre|vent any &s;u&s;picion, was to be left with her Mi&s;tre&s;s till his Lord&s;hip's Arrival, Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> her&s;elf was to engage her in an Apartment as di&s;tant as po&s;&s;ible from the Scene of the intended Mi&s;chief, and out of the Hearing of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Matters being thus agreed on, his Lord&s;hip took his Leave, and her Lady&s;hip retired to Re&s;t, highly plea&s;ed with a Project of which &s;he had no rea&s;on to doubt the Succe&s;s, and which promi&s;ed &s;o effectually

to remove <HI>Sophia</HI> from being any future Ob&s;truction to her Amour with <HI>Jones,</HI> by a Means of which &s;he &s;hould never appear to be guilty, even if the Fact appeared to the World; but this &s;he made no doubt of prevent|ing by huddling up a Marriage, to which &s;he thought the ravi&s;hed <HI>Sophia</HI> would ea&s;ily be brought to con&s;ent, and at which all the re&s;t of her Family would rejoice.</P>
<P>But Affairs were not in &s;o quiet a Situation in the Bo&s;om of the other Con&s;pirator. His Mind was to&s;t in all the di&s;tracting Anxiety &s;o nobly de&s;cribed by <HI>Shake&s;pear.</HI></P>

<P>Though the Violence of his Pa&s;&s;ion had made him eagerly embrace the fir&s;t Hint of this De&s;ign, e&s;peci|ally as it came from a Relation of the Lady, yet when that Friend to Reflection, a Pillow, had placed the Action it&s;elf in all its natural black Colours before his Eyes, with all the Con&s;equences which mu&s;t, and tho&s;e which might probably attend it; his Re&s;olution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the o|ther Side; and after a long Conflict which la&s;ted a whole Night between Honour and Appetite, the former at length prevailed, and he determined to wait on Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> and to relinqui&s;h the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> was in Bed, though very late in the Morning, and <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;itting by her Bed&s;ide, when the Servant acquainted her that Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> was be|low in the Parlour, upon which her Lady&s;hip de&s;ired him to &s;tay, and that &s;he would &s;ee him pre&s;ently; but the Servant was no &s;ooner departed than poor

<P>THE Clock had now &s;truck Seven and poor <HI>So|phia,</HI> alone and melancholy, &s;at reading a Tra|gedy. It was the <HI>Fatal Marriage,</HI> and &s;he was now come to that Part where the poor, di&s;tre&s;t <HI>I&s;abella</HI> di&s;po&s;es of her Wedding-Ring.</P>

<P>Nothing could equal the Dilemma to which <HI>Jones</HI> was now reduced. <HI>Honour</HI> knew nothing of any Ac|quaintance that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Lady <HI>Bel|la&s;ton,</HI> and &s;he was almo&s;t the la&s;t Per&s;on in the World to whom he would have communicated it.

<P>The Hurry in which <HI>Jones</HI> had been all Day en|gaged on Account of his poor Landlady and her Fa|mily, the Terrors occa&s;ioned by Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> and the Confu&s;ion into which he was thrown by the &s;ud|den Arrival of Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> had altogether driven former Thoughts out of his Head; &s;o that it never once occurr'd to his Memory to act the Part of a &s;ick Man; which indeed, neither the Gayety of his Dre&s;s, nor the Fre&s;hne&s;s of his Countenance would have at all &s;upported.</P>
<P>He received her Lady&s;hip therefore rather agreea|bly to her De&s;ires than to her Expectations, with all the good Humour he could mu&s;ter in his Countenance, and without any real or affected Appearance of the lea&s;t Di&s;order.</P>

Nothing can be ima|gined more comic, nor yet more tragical than this Scene would have been, if it had la&s;ted much longer. The Lady had already changed Colour two or three times; had got up from the Bed and &s;at down again, while <HI>Jones</HI> was wi&s;hing the Ground to &s;ink under him, or the Hou&s;e to fall on his Head, when an odd Accident freed him from an Embara&s;&s;ment out of which neither the Eloquence of <HI>Cicero,</HI> nor the Po|liticks of a <HI>Machiavel</HI> could have delivered him, with|out utter Di&s;grace.</P>
<P>This was no other than the Arrival of young <HI>Nightingale</HI> dead drunk; or rather in that State of Drunkenne&s;s which deprives Men of the U&s;e of their Rea&s;on, without depriving them of the U&s;e of their Limbs.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> and her Daughters were in Bed, and <HI>Partridge</HI> was &s;moaking his Pipe by the Kitchen Fire; &s;o that he arrived at Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s Chamber Door with+out any Interruption.

<P><HI>Nightingale</HI> had in Reality mi&s;taken <HI>Jones'</HI>s Apart+ment for that in which him&s;elf had lodged; he there+fore &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on coming in, often &s;wearing that he would not be kept from his own Bed. <HI>Jones</HI> however, prevailed over him, and delivered him in to the Hands of <HI>Partridge,</HI> whom the Noi&s;e on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Stairs &s;oon &s;ummoned to his Ma&s;ter's A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="160">
And now <HI>Jones</HI> was unwillingly obliged to return to his own Apartment, where at the very In&s;tant of his Entrance he heard Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> venting an Excla|mation, though not a very loud one; and at the &s;ame time, &s;aw her flinging her&s;elf into a Chair in a va&s;t Agitation, which in a Lady of a tender Con&s;titution would have been an Hy&s;teric Fit.</P>
<P>In reality the Lady, frightened with the Struggle between the two Men, of which &s;he did not know what would be the I&s;&s;ue, as &s;he heard <HI>Nightingale</HI> &s;wear many Oaths he would come to his own Bed, attempted to retire to her known Place of Hiding, which to her great Confu&s;ion &s;he found already oc|cupied by another.</P>

And here perhaps it may be proper to account for the E&s;cape which this young Gentleman had made from his Uncle, and for his Appearance in the Con|dition in which we have &s;een him the Night before.</P>
<P>Now when the Uncle had arrived at his Lodgings with his Nephew, partly to indulge his own Inclina|tions (for he dearly loved his Bottle) and partly to di&s;qualify his Nephew from the immediate Execu|tion of his Purpo&s;e, he ordered Wine to be &s;et on the Table; with which he &s;o bri&s;kly ply'd the young Gentleman; that this latter, who though not much u&s;ed to Drinking, did not dete&s;t it &s;o as to be guilty of Di&s;obedience or of want of Complai&s;ance by re|fu&s;ing, was &s;oon completely fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the Uncle had obtained this Victory, and was preparing a Bed for his Nephew, a Me&s;&s;enger arrived with a Piece of News, which &s;o entirely di&s;|concerted and &s;hocked him, that he in a Moment lo&s;t all Con&s;ideration for his Nephew, and his whole Mind became entirely taken up with his own Con|cerns.</P>
<P>This &s;udden and afflicting News was no le&s;s than that his Daughter had taken the Opportunity of al|mo&s;t the fir&s;t Moment of his Ab&s;ence, and had gone off with a Neighbouring young Clergyman; again&s;t whom tho' her Father could have had but one Ob|jection, namely, that he was worth nothing, yet &s;he had never thought proper to communicate her Amoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> even to that Father; and &s;o artfully &s;he managed, that it had never been once &s;u&s;pected by any, till now that it was con&s;ummated.</P>
<P>Old Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> no &s;ooner received this Ac|count, than in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion he ordered a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e to be in&s;tantly got ready, and having re|commended his Nephew to the Care of a Servant, he directly left the Hou&s;e, &s;carce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="164">
The Uncle being thus departed, when the Servant came to attend the Nephew to Bed, had waked him for that Purpo&s;e, and had at la&s;t made him &s;en&s;ible that his Uncle was gone, he, in&s;tead of accepting the kind Offices tendered him, in&s;i&s;ted on a Chair be|ing called; with this the Servant, who had received no &s;trict Orders to the contrary, readily complied; and thus being conducted back to the Hou&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> he had &s;taggered up to Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s Chamber, as hath been before recounted.</P>

<P>And now Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having &s;een his good Offices to that poor Woman and her Family brought to a happy Conclu&s;ion, began to apply him&s;elf to his own Concerns; but here le&s;t many of my Readers &s;hould cen&s;ure his Folly for thus troubling him&s;elf with the Affairs of others, and le&s;t &s;ome few &s;hould think he acted more di&s;intere&s;tedly than indeed he did, we think proper to a&s;&s;ure our Reader, that he was &s;o far from being unconcerned in this Matter, that he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ndeed a very con&s;iderable Intere&s;t in bringing it to that final Con&s;ummation.</P>

<P><HI>Jones</HI> had ju&s;t read over the&s;e three Billets when Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> came into the Room. <Q REND="inline">'Well, <HI>Tom,'</HI> &s;aid he, 'any News from Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> after la&s;t Night's Adventure?'</Q> (for it was now no Secret to any one in that Hou&s;e who the Lady was.) <Q REND="inline">'The Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton?</HI></Q> an&s;wered <HI>Jones</HI> very gravely.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'Nay, dear <HI>Tom,</HI>' cries <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'don't be &s;o re&s;erved to your Friends. Though I was too drunk to &s;ee her la&s;t Night, I &s;aw her at the Ma&s;querade. Do you think I am ignorant who the Queen of the Fairies is?'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And did you really then know the Lady at the Ma&s;querade?'</Q> &s;aid <HI>Jones.</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Yes, upon my Soul, did I,' &s;aid <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'and have given you twenty Hints of it &s;ince, though you &s;eemed always &s;o tender on that Point, that I wou'd not &s;peak plainly.

Don't be angry <HI>Tom,</HI> but, upon my Honour, you are not the fir&s;t young Fel|low &s;he hath debauched. Her Reputation is in no Danger, believe me.'</Q></P>
<P>Though <HI>Jones</HI> had no Rea&s;on to imagine the Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o have been of the ve&s;tal Kind when his Amour be|gan,

yet as he was thoroughly ignorant of the Town and had very little Acquaintance in it, he had yet no Knowledge of that Character which is vulgarly called a Demirep; that is to &s;ay, a Woman that intrigues 'with every Man &s;he likes, under the Name and Ap|pearance of Virtue; and who, though &s;ome over-nice Ladies will not be &s;een with her, is vi&s;ited (as they term it) by the whole Town; in &s;hort, whom every Body knows to be what no Body calls her.</P>
<P>When he found, therefore, that <HI>Nightingale</HI> was perfectly acquainted with his Intrigue, and began to &s;u&s;pect that &s;o &s;crupulous a Delicacy as he had hi|therto ob&s;erved, was not quite nece&s;&s;ary on the Oc|ca&s;ion, he gave a Latitude to his Friend's Tongue, and de&s;ired him to &s;peak plainly what he knew, on had ever heard of the Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Nightingale,</HI> who in many other In&s;tances, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> rather too effeminate in his Di&s;po&s;ition, had a pretty &s;trong Inclination to Tittle Tattle. He had no &s;oon|er, therefore, received a full Liberty of &s;peaking from <HI>Jones,</HI> than he entered upon a long Narrative concerning the Lady: which, as it contained many Particulars highly to her Di&s;honour, we have to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> great a Tenderne&s;s for all Women of Condition to repeat; we would cautiou&s;ly avoid giving an Oppor+tunity to the future Commentators on our Works of making any malicious Application; and of forc+ing us to be again&s;t our Will, the Author of Scandal which never entered into our Head.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> having very attentively heard all that <HI>Night+ingale</HI> had to &s;ay, fetched a deep Sigh, which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> other ob&s;erving, cried, <Q REND="inline">'Heyday!

her, but him&s;elf too in his own Conceit, and put him quite out of Humour with both. From this Di&s;gu&s;t, his Mind, by a natural Tran&s;ition, turned towards <HI>Sophia:</HI> Her Virtue, her Purity, her Love to him, her Sufferings on his Account, filled all his Thoughts, and made his Commerce with Lady <HI>Bel|la&s;ton</HI> appear &s;till more odious. The Re&s;ult of all was, that though his turning him&s;elf out of her <HI>Ser|vice,</HI> in which Light he now &s;aw his Affair with her, would be the Lo&s;s of his Bread, yet he determined to quit her; if he could but find a hand&s;ome Pretence; which having communicated to his Friend, <HI>Night|ingale</HI> con&s;idered a little, and then &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'I have it, my Boy; I have found out a &s;ure Method: Pro|po&s;e Marriage to her, and I would venture Hang|ing upon the Succe&s;s.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Marriage!' cries <HI>Jones.</HI> Ay, propo&s;e Marriage,' an&s;wered <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'and &s;he will declare off in a Moment.

<P><HI>Jones</HI> declared he could not venture the Experi|ment. <Q REND="inline">'Perhaps,' &s;aid he, '&s;he may be le&s;s &s;hocked at this Propo&s;al from one Man than from another.

<P>After &s;ome He&s;itation, <HI>Jones,</HI> upon the Strength of this A&s;&s;urance, con&s;ented; but as he &s;wore he wanted the Confidence to propo&s;e the Matter to her Face; he wrote the following Letter, which <HI>Night|ingale</HI> dictated.</P>

<P>I am extremely concerned, that, by an unfor|tunate Engagement abroad, I &s;hould have mi&s;&s;ed receiving the Honour of your Lady&s;hip's Commands the Moment they came; and the Delay which I mu&s;t now &s;uffer of vindicating my&s;elf to your La|dy&s;hip, greatly adds to this Misfortune.

I need not name what that is. Only permit me to &s;ay, that as your Honour is as dear to me as my own, &s;o my &s;ole Ambition is to have the Glory of lay|ing my Liberty at your Feet; and believe me when I a&s;&s;ure you, I can never be made completely hap|py, without you generou&s;ly be&s;tow on me a legal Right of calling you mine for ever.

<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how much I am &s;hock|ed at the Su&s;picion you entertain of me. Can La|dy <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> have conferred Favours on a Man whom &s;he could believe capable of &s;o ba&s;e a De|&s;ign? Or can &s;he treat the mo&s;t &s;olemn Tie of Love with Contempt? Can you imagine, Madam, that if the Violence of my Pa&s;&s;ion, in an unguard|ed Moment, overcame the Tenderne&s;s which I have for your Honour, I would think of indulging my&s;elf in the Continuance of an Intercour&s;e, which could not po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape long the Notice of the World: and which, when di&s;covered, mu&s;t prove &s;o fatal to your Reputation? If &s;uch be your Opi|nion of me, I mu&s;t pray for a &s;udden Opportunity of returning tho&s;e pecuniary Obligations, which I have been &s;o unfortunate to receive at your Hands; and for tho&s;e of a more tender Kind, I &s;hall ever remain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o concluded in the very Words with which he had concluded the former Letter.</P>

Though <HI>Jones</HI> was well &s;atisfied with his Delive|rance from a Thraldom which tho&s;e who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to be none of the lighte&s;t, he was not, however, perfectly ea&s;y in his Mind. There was in this Scheme, too much of Fallacy to &s;atisfy one who utterly dete&s;ted every Spe|cies of Fal&s;hood or Di&s;hone&s;ty: Nor would he, in|deed, have &s;ubmitted to put it in Practice, had he not been involved in a di&s;tre&s;sful Situation, where he was obliged to be guilty of &s;ome Di&s;honour, either to the one Lady or the other; and &s;urely the Reader will allow, that every good Principle, as well as Love, pleaded &s;trongly in Favour of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nightingale,</HI> highly exulted in the Succe&s;s of his Stratagem, upon which he received many Thanks, and much Applau&s;e from his Friend. He an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'Dear <HI>Tom,</HI> we have conferred very different Obli|gations on each other. To me you owe the re|gaining your Liberty; to you I owe the Lo&s;s of mine. But if you are as happy in the one In&s;tance, as I am in the other, I promi&s;e you we are the two happie&s;t Fellows in <HI>England.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>The two Gentlemen were now &s;ummoned down to Dinner, where Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who performed her|&s;elf the Office of Cook, had exerted her be&s;t Talents, to celebrate the Wedding of her Daughter. This joyful Circum&s;tance, &s;he a&s;cribed principally to the friendly behaviour of <HI>Jones,</HI> her whole Soul was fired with Gratitude towards him, and all her Looks, Words, and Actions were &s;o bu&s;ied in expre&s;&s;ing it, that her Daughter, and even her new Son-in-Law, were very little the Objects of her Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Dinner was ju&s;t ended when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> received a Letter, but as we had Letters enough in this Chapter, we &s;hall communicate the Contents in our next.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="168" REF="173">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Con&s;i&s;ting partly of Facts, and partly of Ob&s;ervations upon them.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Letter then which arrived at the End of the preceding Chapter was from Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and the Purport of it was his Intention to come im|mediately to Town, with his Nephew <HI>Blifil,</HI> and a De&s;ire to be accommodated with his u&s;ual Lodg|ings, which were the fir&s;t Floor for him&s;elf, and the &s;econd for his Nephew.</P>
<P>The Chearfulne&s;s which had before di&s;play'd it&s;elf in the Countenance of the poor Woman, was a little clouded on this Occa&s;ion. This News did indeed a good deal di&s;concert her. To requite &s;o di&s;inte|re&s;ted a Match with her Daughter, by pre&s;ently turn|ing her new Son-in-Law out of Doors, appeared to her very unju&s;tifiable, on the one Hand; and on the other, &s;he could &s;carce bear the Thoughts of making any Excu&s;e to Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> after all the Obligations received from him, for depriving him of Lodgings which were indeed &s;trictly his Due: For that Gentleman, in conferring all his numberle&s;s Be|nefits on others, acted by a Rule diametrically oppo|&s;ite to what is practi&s;ed by mo&s;t generous People. He contrived, on all Occa&s;ions, to hide his Beneficence not only from the World, but even from the Object of it. He con&s;tantly u&s;ed the Words Lend and Pay, in&s;tead of Give; and by every other Method he could invent, always le&s;&s;ened the Favours he conferred with his Tongue, while he was heaping them with both his Hands. When he &s;ettled the Annuity of <HI>50l.</HI> a Year, therefore, on Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> he told her, <Q REND="inline">'It was in Con&s;ideration of always having her Fir&s;t-Floor when he was in Town,'</Q> (which he &s;carce ever intended to be) <Q REND="inline">'but that &s;he might let it at any other Time, for that he would always &s;end her a Month's
<PB N="169" REF="174">
Warning.'</Q> He was now, however, hurried to Town &s;o &s;uddenly, that he had no Opportunity of giving &s;uch Notice; and this Hurry probably pre|vented him, when he wrote for his Lodgings, ad|ding, <HI>if they were then empty:</HI> For he would mo&s;t certainly have been well &s;atisfied to have relinqui&s;hed them on a le&s;s &s;ufficient Excu&s;e than what Mrs. <HI>Mil|ler</HI> could now have made.</P>
<P>But there are a Sort of Per&s;ons, who, as <HI>Prior</HI> ex|cellently well remarks, direct their Conduct by &s;ome|thing</P>
<Q><L>Beyond the fix'd and &s;ettled Rules</L>
<L>Of Vice and Virtue in the Schools:</L>
<L>Beyond the Letter of the Law.</L></Q>
<P>To the&s;e it is &s;o far from being &s;ufficient that their Defence would acquit them at the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> that they are not even contented, though Con&s;cience, the &s;evere&s;t of all Judges, &s;hould di&s;charge them. No|thing &s;hort of the Fair and Honourable will &s;atisfy the Delicacy of their Minds; and if any of their Actions fall &s;hort of this Mark, they mope and pine, are as unea&s;y and re&s;tle&s;s as a Murderer, who is afraid of a Gho&s;t, or of the Hangman.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was one of the&s;e. She could not con|ceal her Unea&s;ine&s;s at this Letter; with the Contents of which &s;he had no &s;ooner acquainted the Company, and given &s;ome Hints of her Di&s;tre&s;s, than <HI>Jones,</HI> her good Angel, pre&s;ently relieved her Anxiety. <Q REND="inline">'As for my&s;elf, Madam,' &s;aid he, 'my Lodging is at your Service at a Moment's Warning; and Mr. <HI>Night|ingale,</HI> I am &s;ure, as he cannot yet prepare a Hou&s;e fit to receive his Lady, will con&s;ent to return to his new Lodging, whither Mrs. <HI>Nightingale</HI> will cer|tainly con&s;ent to go.</Q> With which Propo&s;al both Hu&s;band and Wife in&s;tantly agreed.</P>
<P>The Reader will ea&s;ily believe, that the Cheeks of Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> began again to glow with additional Gra|titude to <HI>Jones;</HI> but, perhaps, it may be more diffi|cult
<PB N="170" REF="175">
to per&s;uade him that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> having, in his la&s;t Speech, called her Daughter Mrs. <HI>Nightingale,</HI> (it being the fir&s;t Time that agreeable Sound had ever reached her Ears) gave the fond Mother more Satis|faction, and warmed her Heart more towards <HI>Jones,</HI> than his having di&s;&s;ipated her pre&s;ent Anxiety.</P>
<P>The next Day was then appointed for the Removal of the new-married Couple, and of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who was likewi&s;e to be provided for in the &s;ame Hou&s;e with his Friend. And now the Serenity of the Company was again re&s;tored, and they pa&s;t the Day in the ut|mo&s;t Chearfulne&s;s, all except <HI>Jones,</HI> who, though he outwardly accompanied the re&s;t in their Mirth, felt many a bitter Pang on the Account of his <HI>Sophia;</HI> which were not a little heightened by the News of Mr. <HI>Blifil'</HI>s coming to Town, (for he clearly &s;aw the Intention of his Journey:) And what greatly aggra|vated his Concern was, that Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> who had promi&s;ed to enquire after <HI>Sophia,</HI> and to make her Re|port to him early the next Evening, had di&s;appointed him.</P>
<P>In the Situation that he and his Mi&s;tre&s;s were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> this Time, there were &s;carce any Grounds for him to hope that he &s;hould hear any good News; yet he was as impatient to &s;ee Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> as if he had ex|pected &s;he would bring him a Letter with an A&s;&s;igna+tion in it from <HI>Sophia,</HI> and bore the Di&s;appointment a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> ill.

<P>THERE was a Lady, one Mrs. <HI>Hunt,</HI> who had often &s;een <HI>Jones</HI> at the Hou&s;e where he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the Women there, and indeed a very great Friend to Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI> Her Age was about thirty, for &s;he owned &s;ix and twenty; her Face and Per&s;on very good, only inclining a lit|tle too much to be fat. She had been married young by her Relations to an old <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant, who having got a great Fortune, had left off Trade. With him &s;he lived without Reproach, but not without Pain, in a State of great Self denial, for about twelve Years; and her Virtue was rewarded by his dying, and leav|ing her very rich. The fir&s;t Year of her Widowhood was ju&s;t at an End, and &s;he had pa&s;t it in a good deal of Retirement, &s;eeing only a few particular Friends, and dividing her Time between her Devotions and Novels, of which &s;he was always extremely fond. Very good Health, a very warm Con&s;titution, and a great deal of Religion made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to marry again; and &s;he re&s;olved to plea&s;e her|&s;elf in her &s;econd Hu&s;band, as &s;he had done her Friends in the fir&s;t.

<P>At the reading of this <HI>Jones</HI> was put into a violent Flutter. His Fortune was then at a very low Ebb, the Source being &s;topt from which hitherto he had been &s;upplied. Of all he had received from Lady <HI>Bella&s;|ton</HI> not above five Guineas remained, and that very Morning he had been dunned by a Trade&s;man for twice that Sum. His honourable Mi&s;tre&s;s was in the Hands of her Father, and he had &s;carce any Hopes ever to get her out of them again. To be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at her Expence from that little Fortune &s;he had inde|pendent of her Father, went much again&s;t the Deli|cacy both of his Pride and his Love. This Lady's Fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him and he could have no Objection to her in any Re&s;pect On the contrary, he liked her as well as he did any Woman except <HI>Sophia.</HI> But to abandon <HI>Sophia,</HI> and marry another, that was impo&s;&s;ible; he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> think of it upon any Account.

However as &s;he was inform|ed that the Squire was a Man of a va&s;t Fortune, and as &s;he had taken Care to exact a very extraordinary Price for her Rooms, &s;he did not think proper to give any Offence? for though &s;he was not without &s;ome Concern for the Confinement of poor <HI>Sophia,</HI> of who&s;e great Sweetne&s;s of Temper and Affability, the Maid of the Hou&s;e had made &s;o favourable a Report, which was confirmed by all the Squire's Servants, yet &s;he
<PB N="192" REF="197">
had much more Concern for her own Intere&s;t, than to provoke one, whom, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;he perceived to be a very ha&s;ti&s;h Kind of a Gentleman.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Sophia</HI> eat but little, yet &s;he was regular|ly &s;erved with her Meals; indeed I believe if &s;he had liked any one Rarity, that the Squire, however an|gry, would have &s;pared neither Pains nor Co&s;t to have procured it for her; &s;ince, however &s;trange it may appear to &s;ome of my Readers, he really doated on his Daughter, and to give her any Kind of Plea&s;ure was the highe&s;t Satisfaction of his Life.</P>
<P>The Dinner Hour being arrived, black <HI>George</HI> car|ried her up a Pullet, the Squire him&s;elf (for he had &s;worn not to part with the Key) attending the Door. As <HI>George</HI> depo&s;ited the Di&s;h, &s;ome Compliments pa&s;&s;ed between him and <HI>Sophia,</HI> (for he had not &s;een her &s;ince &s;he left the Country, and &s;he treated every Servant with more Re&s;pect than &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;hew to tho&s;e who are in a very &s;light Degree their Inferiors) <HI>Sophia</HI> would have had him take the Pullet back, &s;ay|ing, &s;he could not eat, but <HI>George</HI> begged her to try, and particularly recommended her to the Eggs, of which he &s;aid it was full.</P>
<P>All this Time the Squire was waiting at the Door; but <HI>George</HI> was a great Favourite with his Ma&s;ter, as his Employment was in Concerns of the highe&s;t Na|ture, namely, about the Game, and was accu&s;tomed to take many Liberties. He had officiou&s;ly carried up the Dinner, being, as he &s;aid, very de&s;irous to &s;ee his young Lady; he made therefore no Scruple of keeping his Ma&s;ter &s;tanding above ten Minutes, while Civilities were pa&s;&s;ing between him and <HI>Sophia,</HI> for which he received only a good-humoured Rebuke at the Door when he returned.</P>
<P>The Eggs of Pullets, Partridges, Phea&s;ants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were, as <HI>George</HI> well knew, the mo&s;t favourite Dain|ties of <HI>Sophia.</HI> It was therefore no Wonder, that he who was a very good-natured Fellow, &s;hould take
<PB N="193" REF="198">
Care to &s;upply her with this Kind of Delicacy, at a Time when all the Servants in the Hou&s;e were afraid &s;he would be &s;tarved; for &s;he had &s;carce &s;wallowed a &s;ingle Mor&s;el in the la&s;t forty Hours.</P>
<P>Though Vexation hath not the &s;ame Effect on all Per&s;ons, as it u&s;ually hath on a Widow, who&s;e Ap|petite it often renders &s;harper than it can be rendered by the Air on <HI>Ban&s;ted</HI> Downs, or <HI>Sali&s;bury</HI> Plain, yet the &s;ublime&s;t Grief, notwith&s;tanding what &s;ome Peo|ple may &s;ay to the contrary, will eat at la&s;t. And <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf, after &s;ome little Con&s;ideration, began to di&s;&s;ect the Fowl, which &s;he found to be as full of Eggs as <HI>George</HI> had reported it.</P>
<P>But if &s;he was plea&s;ed with the&s;e, it contained &s;omething which would have delighted the Royal So|ciety much more; for if a Fowl with three Legs be &s;o invaluable a Curio&s;ity, when perhaps Time hath produced a Thou&s;and &s;uch, at what Price &s;hall we e&s;teem a Bird which &s;o totally contradicts all the Laws of Animal Oeconomy, as to contain a Letter in its Belly? <HI>Ovid</HI> tells us of a Flower into which <HI>Hya|cinthus</HI> was metamorpho&s;ed, that bears Letters on its Leaves, which <HI>Virgil</HI> recommended as a Miracle to the Royal Society of his Day; but no Age nor Nation hath ever recorded a Bird with a Letter in its Maw.</P>
<P>But though a Miracle of this Kind might have en|gaged all the <HI>Academies des Sciences</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and perhaps in a fruitle&s;s Enquiry, yet the Reader by bare|ly recollecting the la&s;t Dialogue which pa&s;&s;ed between Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Partridge,</HI> will be very ea&s;ily &s;atisfied from whence this Letter came, and how it found its Pa&s;&s;age into the Fowl.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia,</HI> notwith&s;tanding her long Fa&s;t, and notwith|&s;tanding her favourite Di&s;h was there before her, no &s;ooner &s;aw the Letter than &s;he immediately &s;natched it up, tore it open, and read as follows.</P>

<P>What <HI>Sophia</HI> &s;aid, or did, or thought upon this Let|ter, how often &s;he read it, or whether more than once, &s;hall all be left to our Reader's Imagination. The An&s;wer to it he may perhaps &s;ee hereafter, but not at pre&s;ent; for this Rea&s;on, among others, that &s;he did not now write any, and that for &s;everal good Cau&s;es, one of which was this, &s;he had no Paper, Pen, nor Ink.</P>
<P>In the Evening while <HI>Sophia</HI> was meditating on the Letter &s;he had received, or &s;omething el&s;e, a violent Noi&s;e from below di&s;turbed her Meditation. This Noi&s;e was no other than a round Bout at Alterca|tion between two Per&s;ons. One of the Combatants, by his Voice, &s;he immediately di&s;tingui&s;hed to be her Father; but &s;he did not &s;o &s;oon di&s;cover the &s;hriller Pipes to belong to the Organ of her Aunt <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who was ju&s;t arrived in Town, and having by means of one of her Servants, who &s;topt at the <HI>Hercules Pil|lars,</HI> learnt where her Brother lodged, &s;he drove di|rectly to his Lodgings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>In which</HI> Sophia <HI>is delivered from her Confinement.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Squire and the Par&s;on (for the Landlord was now otherwi&s;e engaged) were &s;moaking their Pipes together, when the Arrival of the Lady was fir&s;t &s;ignified. The Squire no &s;ooner heard her Name, than he immediately ran down to u&s;her her up Stairs; for he was a great Ob&s;erver of &s;uch Ceremo|nials, e&s;pecially to his Si&s;ter, of whom he &s;tood more in awe than of any other human Creature, though he ne|ver would own this, nor did he perhaps know it him&s;elf.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>A Child who hath ju&s;t learnt his Letters, would have &s;pelt this Letter out in le&s;s Time than <HI>Jones</HI> took in reading it. The Sen&s;ations it occa&s;ioned were a Mixture of Joy and Grief; &s;omewhat like what di|vide the Mind of a good Man when he peru&s;es the Will of his decea&s;ed Friend, in which a large Legacy, which his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es make the more welcome, is be|queathed to him. Upon the whole, however, he was more plea&s;ed than di&s;plea&s;ed; and indeed the Reader may probably wonder that he was di&s;plea&s;ed at all; but the Reader is not quite &s;o much in Love as
<PB N="204" REF="209">
was poor <HI>Jones:</HI> And Love is a Di&s;ea&s;e, which, tho' it may in &s;ome In&s;tances re&s;emble a Con&s;umption, (which it &s;ometimes cau&s;es) in others proceeds in di|rect Oppo&s;ition to it, and particularly in this, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> never flatters it&s;elf, or &s;ees any one Symptom in a fa|vourable Light.</P>
<P>One Thing gave him complete Satisfaction, which was, that his Mi&s;tre&s;s had regained her Liberty, and was now with a Lady where &s;he might at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf of a decent Treatment. Another comforta|ble Circum&s;tance, was the Reference which &s;he made to her Promi&s;e of never marrying any other Man. For however di&s;intere&s;ted he might imagine his Pa&s;|&s;ion, and notwith&s;tanding all the generous Overture made in his Letter, I very much que&s;tion whether he could have heard a more afflicting Piece of News, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> that <HI>Sophia</HI> was married to another tho' the Matc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> had been never &s;o great, and never &s;o likely to end in making her completely happy. That refined Degre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> of <HI>Platonic</HI> Affection which is ab&s;olutely detached from the Fle&s;h, and is indeed entirely and purely &s;pi|ritual, is a Gift confined to the female Part of the Cre|ation: many of whom I have heard declare, (and doubtle&s;s with great Truth) that they would, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the utmo&s;t Readine&s;s, re&s;ign a Lover to a Rival, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch Re&s;ignation was proved to be nece&s;&s;ary for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> temporal Intere&s;t of &s;uch Lover. Hence, therefore I conclude, that this Affection is in Nature, though I cannot pretend to &s;ay, I have ever &s;een an In&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it.</P>

<P>In the fir&s;t Row then of the fir&s;t Gallery did Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> her younge&s;t Daughter, and <HI>Par|tridge</HI> take their Place: <HI>Partridge</HI> immediately de|clared, it was the fine&s;t Place he had ever been in.

<P>THE Reader may now perhaps be plea&s;ed to re|turn with us to Mr, <HI>Jones,</HI> who at the appoint|ed Hour attended on Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> but before we relate the Conver&s;ation which now pa&s;t, it may be

proper, according to our Method, to return a little back, and to account for &s;o great an Alteration of Behaviour in this Lady, that from changing her Lodging principally to avoid Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;he had now indu&s;triou&s;ly, as hath been &s;een, &s;ought this Inter|view.</P>
<P>And here we &s;hall need only to re&s;ort to what hap|pened the preceding Day, when hearing from Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> that Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was arrived in Town, &s;he went to pay her Duty to him, at his Lodgings a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Piccadilly,</HI> when &s;he was received with many &s;curvy Compellations too coar&s;e to be repeated, and was even threatned to be kicked out of Doors. From hence an old Servant of her Aunt <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> with whom &s;he was well acquainted, conducted her to the Lodg|ings of that Lady, who treated her, not more kindly, but more politely; or, to &s;ay the Truth, with Rude|ne&s;s in another Way. In &s;hort, &s;he returned from both, plainly convinced not only that her Scheme o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Reconciliation had proved abortive, but that &s;he mu&s;t for ever give over all Thoughts of bringing it about by any Means whatever. From this Moment De|&s;ire of Revenge only filled her Mind; and in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Temper meeting <HI>Jones</HI> at the Play, an Oppor|tunity &s;eemed to her to occur of effecting this Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The Reader mu&s;t remember, that he was acquaint|ed by Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> in the Account &s;he gave o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her own Story, with the Fondne&s;s Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> had formerly &s;hewn for Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> from the Di&s;appointment of which, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> de|rived the great Bitterne&s;s her Aunt had expre&s;&s;ed to|ward her.

<PB N="223" REF="228">
&s;ince made in Age, &s;he concluded (how ju&s;tly I will not &s;ay) was an Argument rather in Favour of her Project than again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Therefore, when <HI>Jones</HI> attended after a previous Declaration of her De&s;ire of &s;erving him, ari&s;ing, as &s;he &s;aid from a Firm A&s;&s;urance how much &s;he &s;hould by &s;o doing oblige <HI>Sophia;</HI> and after &s;ome Excu&s;es for her former Di&s;appointment, and after acquainting Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> in who&s;e Cu&s;tody his Mi&s;tre&s;s was, of which &s;he thought him ignorant; &s;he very explicitly mentioned her Scheme to him, and advi&s;ed him to make Sham Addre&s;&s;es to the older Lady, in order to procure an ea&s;y Acce&s;s to the Younger, inform|ing him at the &s;ame Time of the Succe&s;s which Mr. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had formerly owed to the very &s;ame Stra|tagem.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> expre&s;t great Gratitude to the Lady for the kind Intentions towards him which &s;he had ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and indeed, te&s;tified by this Propo&s;al; but be&s;ides intimating &s;ome Diffidence of Succe&s;s from the Lady's Knowledge of his Love to her Neice, which had not been her Ca&s;e in regard to Mr. <HI>Fitz|patrick,</HI> he &s;aid, he was afraid Mi&s;s <HI>We&s;tern</HI> would never agree to an Impo&s;ition of this Kind, as well from her utter Dete&s;tation of all Fallacy, as from her avowed Duty to her Aunt.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> was a little nettled at this; and indeed if it may not be called a Lap&s;e of the Tongue, it was a &s;mall Deviation from Politene&s;s in <HI>Jones,</HI> and into which he would &s;carce have fallen, had not the Delight he felt in prai&s;ing <HI>Sophia,</HI> hurried him out of all Reflection; for this Commendation of one Cou&s;in was more than a tacit Rebuke on the other.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Indeed, Sir,' an&s;wered the Lady, with &s;ome Warmth, 'I cannot think there is any thing ea&s;ier than to cheat an old Woman with a Profe&s;&s;ion of

<P><HI>Jones</HI> now clearly &s;aw the Error he had committed, and exerted his utmo&s;t Power to rectify it; but he only faultered and fluttered into Non&s;en&s;e and Con|tradiction. To &s;ay the Truth, it is often &s;afer to abide by the Con&s;equences of the fir&s;t Blunder, than to endeavour to rectify it; for by &s;uch Endeavours, we generally plunge deeper in&s;tead of extricating our|&s;elves; and few Per&s;ons will on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, have the good Nature, which Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> di&s;|play'd to <HI>Jones;</HI> by &s;aying, with a Smile, <Q REND="inline">'You need attempt no more Excu&s;es; for I can ea&s;ily forgive a real Lover, whatever is the Effect of Fondne&s;s for his Mi&s;tre&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P>She then renewed her Propo&s;al, and very fervently recommended it, omitting no Argument which her Invention could &s;ugge&s;t on the Subject; for &s;he was &s;o violently incen&s;ed again&s;t her Aunt, that &s;carce any Thing was capable of affording her equal Plea&s;ure

<P>When <HI>Jones</HI> had fini&s;hed his Exclamations, many of which would have become the Mouth of <HI>Oroondates</HI> him&s;elf, Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> heaved a deep Sigh, and taking her Eyes off from <HI>Jones,</HI> on whom they had been &s;ome time fixed, and dropping them on the Ground, &s;he cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'Indeed Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> I pity you, but it is the Cur&s;e of &s;uch Tenderne&s;s to be thrown away on tho&s;e who are in&s;en&s;ible of it.

they were moreover farther encouraged by his Gene|ro&s;ity, (for he had given them of his own Accord Sixpence more than their Fare) they therefore very boldly demanded another Shilling, which &s;o provok|ed the Squire, that he not only be&s;towed many hear|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y Cur&s;es on them at the Door, but retained his Anger after he came into the Room; &s;wearing, that all the <HI>Londoners</HI> were like the Court, and thought of no|thing but plundering Country Gentlemen. <Q REND="inline">'D&mdash;n me, &s;ays he, if I won't walk in the Rain rather than get into one of their Handbarrows again.

An Alliance between two Fa|milies &s;o nearly Neighbours, and between whom there had always exi&s;ted &s;o mutual an Intercour&s;e and good Harmony, I thought a mo&s;t de&s;ireable Event; and with Regard to the young Lady, not only the concurrent Opinion of all who knew her, but my own Ob&s;ervation a&s;&s;ured me that &s;he would be an ine&s;timable Trea&s;ure to a good Hu&s;band. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of her per&s;onal Qualifications, which certainly are admirable; her Good-nature, her cha|ritable Di&s;po&s;ition, her Mode&s;ty are too well known to need any Panegyric: but &s;he hath one Quality which exi&s;ted in a high Degree in that be&s;t of Wo|men, who is now one of the fir&s;t Angels, which as it is not of a glaring Kind, more commonly e&s;|capes Ob&s;ervation; &s;o little indeed is it remarked, that I want a Word to expre&s;s it.

my&s;elf of them. Now to force a Woman into a Marriage contrary to her con&s;ent or Approbation, is an Act of &s;uch Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, that I wi&s;h the Laws of our Country could re&s;train it; but a good Con&s;cience is never lawle&s;s in the wor&s;t regu|lated State, and will provide tho&s;e Laws for it&s;elf, which the Neglect of Legi&s;lators hath forgotten to &s;upply. This is &s;urely a Ca&s;e of that Kind; for is it not cruel, nay impious, to force a Woman into that State again&s;t her Will; for her Behaviour in which &s;he is to be accountable to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t dreadful Court of Judicature, and to an&s;wer at the Peril of her Soul. To di&s;charge the Matrimo|nial Duties in an adequate Manner is no ea&s;y Ta&s;k, and &s;hall we lay this Burthen upon a Woman while we at the &s;ame Time deprive her of all that A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance which may enable her to undergo it? Shall we tear her very Heart from her, while we enjoin her Duties to which a whole Heart is &s;carce equal. I mu&s;t &s;peak very plainly here, I think Parents who act in this Manner are Acce&s;&s;aries to all the Guilt which their Children afterwards incur, and of Cour&s;e mu&s;t, before a ju&s;t Judge, expect to partake of their Puni&s;hment; but if they could avoid this, good Heaven! is there a Soul who can bear the Thought of having contributed to the Damnation of his Child?'</Q></P>

In|difference may, Perhaps, &s;ometimes yield to it; but the u&s;ual Triumphs gained by Per&s;everance in a Lover, are over Caprice, Prudence, Affectation, and often an exorbitant Degree of Levity, which excites Women not overwarm, in their Con&s;titu|tions, to indulge their Vanity by prolonging the Time of Court&s;hip, even when they are well e|nough plea&s;ed with the Object, and re&s;olve (if they

ever re&s;olve at all) to make him a very pitiful A|mends in the End. But a fixed Di&s;like, as I am afraid this is, will rather gather Strength, than be conquered by Time. Be&s;ides, my dear, I have a|nother Apprehen&s;ion which you mu&s;t excu&s;e. I am afraid this Pa&s;&s;ion which you have for this fine young Creature, hath her beautiful Per&s;on too much for its Object, and is unworthy of the Name of that Love, which is the only Foundation of matrimonial Felicity. To admire, to like, and to long for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a beautiful Woman, without any Re|gard to her Sentiments towards us, is, I am afraid, too natural: But Love, I believe, is the Child of Love only; at lea&s;t, I am pretty confident, that to love the Creature who we are a&s;&s;ured hates us, is not in Human Nature. Examine your Heart, there|fore, thoroughly, my good Boy, and if, upon Examination, you have but the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of this Kind, I am &s;ure your own Virtue and Religion will impel you to drive &s;o vicious a Pa&s;&s;ion from your Heart, and your good Sen&s;e will &s;oon enable you to do it without Pain.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>An extraordinary Scene betwen</HI> Sophia <HI>and her Aunt.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE lowing Heifer, and the bleating Ewe in Herds and Flocks, may ramble &s;afe and un|regarded through the Pa&s;tures. The&s;e are, indeed, hereafter doomed to be the Prey of Man; yet many Years are they &s;uffered to enjoy their Liberty undi&s;|turbed. But if a plump Doe be di&s;covered to have e&s;|caped
<PB N="248" REF="253">
from the Fore&s;t, and to repo&s;e her&s;elf in &s;ome Field or Grove, the whole Pari&s;h is pre&s;ently alarm|ed, every Man is ready to &s;et his Dogs after her; and if &s;he is pre&s;erved from the re&s;t by the good Squire, it is only that he may &s;ecure her for his own eating.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered a very fine young Woman of Fortune and Fa&s;hion, when fir&s;t found &s;trayed from the Pale of her Nur&s;ery, to be in pretty much the &s;ame Situation with this Doe. The Town is immediately in an Uproar, &s;he is hunted from Park to Play, from Court to A&s;&s;embly, from A&s;&s;embly to her own Chamber, and rarely e&s;capes a &s;ingle Sea&s;on from the Jaws of &s;ome Devourer or other: For if her Friends protect her from &s;ome, it is only to deliver her over to one of their own chu&s;ing, often more di&s;agreeable to her than any of the re&s;t: While whole Herds on Flocks of other Women &s;ecurely, and &s;carce regard|ed, traver&s;e the Park, the Play, the Opera, and the A&s;&s;embly; and though, for the mo&s;t Part at lea&s;t, they are at la&s;t devoured, yet for a long Time do they wanton in Liberty, without Di&s;turbance or Controul.</P>
<P>Of all the&s;e Paragons, none ever ta&s;ted more of this Per&s;ecution than poor <HI>Sophia.</HI> Her ill Stars were not contented with all that &s;he had &s;uffered on Account of <HI>Blifil,</HI> they now rai&s;ed her another Pur&s;uer, who &s;eemed likely to torment her no le&s;s than the other had done. For though her Aunt was le&s;s violent, &s;he was no le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous in teazing her, than her Father had been before.</P>
<P>The Servants were no &s;ooner departed after Dinner than Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> who had opened the Matter to <HI>Sophia,</HI> informed her, <Q REND="inline">'That &s;he expected his Lord|&s;hip that very afternoon, and intended to take the fir&s;t Opportunity of leaving her alone with him.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'If you do, Madam,' an&s;wered <HI>Sophia,</HI> with &s;ome Spirit, 'I &s;hall take the fir&s;t Opportunity of leaving him by him&s;elf.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">' 'How!

are In&s;tances of this Kind &s;o rare, as &s;ome &s;uperficial and inaccurate Ob&s;ervers have reported. To &s;ay the Truth, Want of Compa&s;&s;ion is not to be numbered among our general Faults. The black Ingredien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> which fouls our Di&s;po&s;ition is Envy. Hence our Eye is &s;eldom, I am afraid, turned upward to tho&s;e who are manife&s;tly greater, better, wi&s;er, or happie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> than our&s;elves, without &s;ome Degree of Malignity; while we commonly look down on the Mean and Mi&s;erable, with &s;ufficient Benevolence and Pity. In Fact, I have remarked, that mo&s;t of the Defects which have di&s;covered them&s;elves within my Ob&s;er|vation have ari&s;en from Envy only; a helli&s;h Vice; and yet one from which I have known very few ab|&s;olutely exempt.

<PB N="260" REF="265">
And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever le&s;s in his Thoughts than to marry Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>Though <HI>Sophia</HI> read the Letter twice over with great Attention, his Meaning &s;till remained a Riddle to her, nor could her Invention &s;ugge&s;t to her any Means to Excu&s;e <HI>Jones.</HI> She certainly remained very angry with him, though indeed Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> took up &s;o much of her Re&s;entment that her gentle Mind had but little left to be&s;tow on any other Per&s;on.</P>
<P>That Lady was mo&s;t unluckily to dine this very Day with her Aunt <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and in the Afternoon, they were all three by Appointment to go together to the Opera, and thence to Lady <HI>Thomas Hatchet'</HI>s Drum. <HI>Sophia</HI> would have gladly been excu&s;ed from all, but &s;he would not di&s;oblige her Aunt; and as to the Arts of counterfeiting Illne&s;s, &s;he was &s;o entirely a Stranger to them, that it never once entered into her Head. When &s;he was dre&s;t, therefore, down &s;he went, re&s;olved to encounter all the Horrours of the Day, and a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable one it proved; for La|dy <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> took every Opportunity very civilly and &s;lily to in&s;ult her; to all which her Dejection of Spi|rits di&s;abled her from making any Return; and indeed, to confe&s;s the Truth, &s;he was at the very be&s;t but an different Mi&s;tre&s;s of Repartee.</P>
<P>Another Misfortune which befel <HI>Sophia,</HI> was the Company of Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> whom &s;he met at the Opera, and who attended her to the Drum. And though both Places were too publick to admit of any Particularities, and &s;he was farther relieved by the Mu|&s;ick at the one Place and by the Cards at the other, &s;he could not however enjoy her&s;elf in his Company: for there is &s;omething of Delicacy in Women, which will not &s;uffer them to be even ea&s;y in the Pre&s;ence of a Man whom they know to have Preten&s;ions to them, which they are di&s;inclined to favour.</P>
<P>Having in this Chapter twice mentioned a Drum, a Word which our Po&s;terity, it is hoped, will not
<PB N="261" REF="266">
under&s;tand in the Sen&s;e it is here applied, we &s;hall, notwith&s;tanding our pre&s;ent Ha&s;te, &s;top a Moment to de&s;cribe the Entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a Moment de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>A Drum then is an A&s;&s;embly of well dre&s;&s;ed Per|&s;ons of both Sexes, mo&s;t of whom play at Cards, and the re&s;t do nothing at all; while the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e performs the Part of a Landlady at an Inn, and like the Landlady of an Inn prides her&s;elf in the Number of her Gue&s;ts, though &s;he doth not always, like her, get any thing by it.</P>
<P>No wonder then as &s;o much Spirits mu&s;t be re|quired to &s;upport any Vivacity in the&s;e Scenes of Dul|ne&s;s, that we hear Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion eternally com|plaining of the Want of them; a Complaint con|fined entirely to upper Life. How in&s;upportable mu&s;t we imagine this Round of Impertinence to have been to <HI>Sophia,</HI> at this time; how difficult mu&s;t &s;he have found it to force the Appearance of Gaiety in|to her Looks, when her Mind dictated nothing but the tendere&s;t Sorrow, and when every Thought was charged with tormenting Ideas.</P>
<P>Night, however at la&s;t, re&s;tored her to her Pillow, where we will leave her to &s;oothe her Melancholy at+lea&s;t, though incapable we are afraid of Re&s;t, and &s;hall pur&s;ue our Hi&s;tory, which &s;omething whi&s;pers us is now arrived at the Eve of &s;ome great Event.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>A pathetic Scene between Mr.</HI> Allworthy <HI>and Mrs.</HI> Miller.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. <HI>Miller</HI> had a long Di&s;cour&s;e with Mr. <HI>All|worthy</HI> at his Return from his Dinner, in which &s;he accquainted him with <HI>Jones'</HI>s having unfortunately lo&s;t all which he was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on him at their Separation; and with the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which that Lo&s;s had &s;ubjected him; of all which &s;he had received
<PB N="263" REF="267">
a full Account from the faithful Retailer <HI>Partridge.</HI> She then explained the Obligations &s;he had to <HI>Jones;</HI> not that &s;he was entirely explicite with regard to her Daughter; for though &s;he had the utmo&s;t. Confidence in Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and though there could be no Hopes of keeping an Affair &s;ecret, which was un|happily known to more than half a Dozen; yet &s;he could not prevail with her&s;elf to mention tho&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances which reflected mo&s;t on the Cha&s;tity of poor <HI>Nancy;</HI> but &s;mothered that Part of her Evidence as cautiou&s;ly as if &s;he had been before a Judge, and the Girl was now on her Trial for the Murder of a Ba&s;tard.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> &s;aid, there were few Characters &s;o ab|&s;olutely vicious as not to have the lea&s;t Mixture of Good in them. <Q REND="inline">'However,' &s;ays he, 'I cannot deny but that you had &s;ome Obligations to the Fel|low, bad as he is, and I &s;hall therefore Excu&s;e what has pa&s;t already, but mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t you never mention his Name to me more; for I promi&s;e you it was upon the fulle&s;t and plaine&s;t Evidence that I re&s;olved to take the Mea&s;ures I have taken.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Well, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, I make not the lea&s;t doubt, but Time will &s;hew all Matters in their true and natural Colours, and that you will be convinced this poor young Man de&s;erves better of you than &s;ome other Folks that &s;hall be namele&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Madam,' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> a little ruffled, 'I will not hear any Reflections on my Nephew, and if you ever &s;ay a Word more of that Kind, I will de|part from your Hou&s;e that In&s;tant. He is the wor|thie&s;t and be&s;t of Men; and I once more repeat it to you, he hath carried his Friend&s;hip to this Man to a blameable Length, by too long concealing Facts of the blacke&s;t Die. The Ingratitude of the Wretch to this good young Man is what I mo&s;t re|&s;ent; for, Madam, I have the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to
<PB N="262" REF="268">
imagine he had laid a Plot to &s;upplant my Nephew in my Favour, and to have di&s;inherited him.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'I am &s;ure, Sir,' an&s;wered Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> a little frightened (for though Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had the utmo&s;t Sweetne&s;s and Benevolence in his Smiles, he had great Terror in his Frowns) 'I &s;hall never &s;peak a|gain&s;t any Gentlemen you are plea&s;ed to think well of. I am &s;ure, Sir, &s;uch Behaviour would very little become me, e&s;pecially when the Gentleman is your neare&s;t Relation; but, Sir, you mu&s;t not be angry with me, you mu&s;t not indeed, for my good Wi&s;hes to this poor Wretch. Sure, I may call him &s;o now, though once you would have been angry with me, if I had &s;poke of him with the lea&s;t Di&s;re&s;pect. How often have I heard you call him your Son? How often have you prattled to me of him with all the Fondne&s;s of a Parent? Nay, Sir, I cannot forget the many tender Expre&s;&s;ions, the many good Things you have told me of his Beauty, and his Parts, and his Virtues: of his Good-nature and Ge|nero&s;ity.&mdash;I am &s;ure, Sir, I cannot forget them: For I find them all true. I have experienced them in my own Cau&s;e. They have pre&s;erved my Fa|mily. You mu&s;t pardon my Tears, Sir, indeed you mu&s;t, when I con&s;ider the cruel Rever&s;e of Fortune which this poor Youth, to whom I am &s;o much obliged, hath &s;uffered; when I con&s;ider the Lo&s;s of your Favour, which I know he valued more than his Life, I mu&s;t, I mu&s;t lament him. If you had a Dagger in your Hand, ready to plunge into my Heart, I mu&s;t lament the Mi&s;ery of one whom you have loved, and I &s;hall ever love.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was pretty much moved with this Speech, but it &s;eemed not to be with Anger: For after a &s;hort Silence, taking Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> by the Hand, he &s;aid very affectionately to her; <Q REND="inline">'Come, Madam, let us con&s;ider a little about your Daughter. I cannot blame you, for rejoicing in a Match which pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="264" REF="269">
to be advantageous to her; but you know this Advantage, in a great Mea&s;ure, depends on the Father's Reconciliation. I know Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> very well, and have formerly had Concerns with him; I will make him a Vi&s;it, and endeavour to &s;erve you in this Matter. I believe he is a worldly Man; but as this is an only Son, and the Thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in Time be brought to Rea&s;on. I promi&s;e you I will do all I can for you.'</Q></P>
<P>Many were the Acknowledgments which the poor Woman made to <HI>Allworthy,</HI> for this Kind and gene|rous Offer, nor could &s;he refrain from taking this Occa&s;ion again to expre&s;s her Gratitude towards <HI>Jones,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'to whom &s;aid &s;he, I owe the Opportunity of giving you, Sir, this pre&s;ent Trouble.'</Q> <HI>Allworthy</HI> gently &s;top|ped her; but he was too good a Man to be really of|fended with the Effects of &s;o noble a Principle as now actuated Mrs. <HI>Miller;</HI> and indeed had not this new Affair inflamed his former Anger again&s;t <HI>Jones,</HI> it is po&s;&s;ible he might have been a little &s;oftened towards him by the Report of an Action which Malice it&s;elf could not have derived from an evil Motive.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had been above an Hour together, when their Conver&s;ation was put an End to by the Arrival of <HI>Blifil,</HI> and another Per&s;on, which other Per&s;on was no le&s;s than Mr. <HI>Dowling,</HI> the Attorney, who was now become a great Favourite with Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> and whom Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> at the De&s;ire of his Nephew, had made his Steward, and had likewi&s;e recommended him to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> from whom the Attorney received a Promi&s;e of being pro|moted to the &s;ame Office upon the fir&s;t Vacancy; and in the mean Time was employed in tran&s;acting &s;ome Affairs which the Squire then had in <HI>London,</HI> in Re|lation to a Mortgage.</P>
<P>This was the principal Affair which then brought Mr. <HI>Dowling</HI> to Town, therefore he took the &s;ame
<PB N="265" REF="270">
Opportunity to charge him&s;elf with &s;ome Money for Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and to make a Report to him of &s;ome other Bu&s;ine&s;s; in all which as it was of much too dull a Nature to find any Place in this Hi&s;tory, we will leave the Uncle, Nephew, and their Lawyer concerned, and re&s;ort to other Matters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Containing various Matters.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we return to Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> we will take one more View of <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>Though that young Lady had brought her Aunt in|to great good Humour by tho&s;e &s;oothing Methods, which we have before related, &s;he had not brought her in the lea&s;t to abate of her Zeal for the Match with Lord <HI>Fellamar;</HI> this Zeal was now inflamed by Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> who had told her the preceding Evening, that &s;he was well &s;atisfied from the Conduct of <HI>Sophia,</HI> and from her Carriage to his Lord&s;hip, that all Delays would be dangerous, and that the only Way to &s;ucceed, was to pre&s;s the Match forward with &s;uch Rapidity, that the young Lady &s;hould have no Time to reflect, and be obliged to con&s;ent, while &s;he &s;earce knew what &s;he did. In which Manner, &s;he &s;aid, one half of the Marriages among People of Con|dition were brought about. A Fact very probably true, and to which I &s;uppo&s;e is owing the mutual Tenderne&s;s which afterwards exi&s;ts among &s;o many happy Couples.</P>
<P>A Hint of the &s;ame Kind was given by the &s;ame Lady to Lord <HI>Fellamar;</HI> and both the&s;e &s;o readily embraced the Advice, that the very next Day was, at his Lord&s;hip's Reque&s;t, appointed by Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> for a private Interview between the young Parties. This was communicated to <HI>Sophia</HI> by her Aunt, and a&s;i&s;ted upon in &s;uch high Terms, that, after having ur|ged every Thing &s;he po&s;&s;ibly could invent again&s;t it,
<PB N="266" REF="271">
without the lea&s;t Effect, &s;he at la&s;t agreed to give the highe&s;t In&s;tance of Complai&s;ance which any young Lady can give, and con&s;ented to &s;ee his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>As Conver&s;ations of this Kind afford no great En|tertainment, we &s;hall be excu&s;ed from reeiting the whole that pa&s;t at-this Interview; in which, after, his Lord&s;hip had made many Declarations of the mo&s;t pure and ardent Pa&s;&s;ions, to the &s;ilent, blu&s;hing <HI>So|phia;</HI> &s;he at la&s;t collected all the Spirits &s;he could rai&s;e, and with a trembling low Voice, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'My Lord, you mu&s;t be your&s;elf con&s;cious whether your former Behaviour to me hath been con&s;i&s;tent with the Profe&s;&s;ions you now make.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'Is there, an|&s;wered he, no Way by which I can attone for Madne&s;s?

and perhaps it could not all be &s;trictly reconcil|ed either to Sen&s;e or Grammar; but he concluded his ranting Speech with &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'That if &s;he has pre|engaged her&s;elf to any Gentleman, however unhap|py it would make him, he &s;hould think him&s;elf bound in Honour to de&s;i&s;t.'</Q> Perhaps my Lord laid too much Empha&s;is on the Word Gentleman; for we cannot el&s;e well account for the Indignation with which he in&s;pired <HI>Sophia,</HI> who, in her An&s;wer, &s;eemed greatly to re&s;ent &s;ome Affront he had given her.</P>
<P>While &s;he was &s;peaking, with her Voice more rai&s;ed than u&s;ual, Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> came into the Room, the Fire glaring in her Cheeks, and the Flames bur&s;t|ing from her Eyes. <Q REND="inline">'I am a&s;hamed, &s;ays &s;he, my Lord, of the Reception which you have met with.

<P>The Remainder of the Conver&s;ation between Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and his Lord&s;hip, till the latter withdrew, con&s;i&s;ted of bitter Lamentations on his Side, and on hers of the &s;tronge&s;t A&s;&s;urances that her Neice &s;hould and would con&s;ent to all he wi&s;hed. <Q REND="inline">'Indeed, my Lord, &s;ays &s;he, the Girl hath had a fooli&s;h Educa|tion, neither adapted to her Fortune nor her Fami|ly.

Nothing el&s;e, my Lord, upon my Honour; I am convinced &s;he hath a good Under&s;tanding at the Bottom, and will be brought to Rea&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t Speech was made in the Ab&s;ence of <HI>Sophia,</HI> for &s;he had &s;ometime before left the Room with more
<PB N="269" REF="274">
Appearance of Pa&s;&s;ion than &s;he had ever &s;hewn on any Occa&s;ion; and now his Lord&s;hip, after many Expre&s;&s;ions of Thanks to Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> many ardent Profe&s;&s;ions of Pa&s;&s;ion which nothing could conquer, and many A&s;&s;urances of Per&s;everance which Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> highly encouraged, took his Leave for this Time.</P>
<P>Before we relate what now pa&s;&s;ed between Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Sophia,</HI> it may be proper to mention an unfortunate Accident which had happened, and which had occa&s;ioned the Return of Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> with &s;o much Fury as we have &s;een.</P>
<P>The Reader then mu&s;t know, that the Maid who at pre&s;ent attended on <HI>Sophia,</HI> was recommended by Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> with whom &s;he had lived for &s;ome Time in the Capacity of a Comb-bru&s;h; &s;he was a very &s;en&s;ible Girl, and had received the &s;tricte&s;t In|&s;tructions to watch her young Lady very carefully. The&s;e In&s;tructions, we are &s;orry to &s;ay, were com|municated to her by Mrs. <HI>Honour,</HI> into who&s;e Fa|vour Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> had now &s;o ingratiated her&s;elf, that the violent Affection which the good Waiting-Woman had formerly borne to <HI>Sophia,</HI> was entirely obliterated by that great Attachment which &s;he had to her new Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Now when Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> was departed, <HI>Betty</HI> (for that was the Name of the Girl) returning to her young Lady, found her very attentively engaged in reading a long Letter, and the vi&s;ible Emotions which &s;he betrayed on that Occa&s;ion, might have well account|ed for &s;ome Su&s;picions which the Girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a &s;tronger Foundation, for &s;he had overheard the whole Scene which pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Sophia</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was acquainted with all this Matter by <HI>Betty,</HI> who, after receiving many Commendati|ons, and &s;ome Rewards for her Fidelity, was order|ed, that if the Woman who brought the Letter, came
<PB N="270" REF="275">
again, &s;he &s;hould introduce her to Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Unluckily Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> returned at the very time when <HI>Sophia</HI> was engaged with his Lord&s;hip. <HI>Betty,</HI> according to Order, &s;ent her directly to the Aunt; who being Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o many Circum&s;tances relating to what had pa&s;t the Day before, ea&s;ily impo&s;ed up|on the poor Woman to believe that <HI>Sophia</HI> had com|municated the whole Affair; and &s;o pumped every+thing out of her which &s;he knew, relating to the Let|ter, and relating to <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>This poor Creature might indeed be called Sim|plicity it&s;elf. She was one of that Order of Mor|tals, who are apt to believe every thing which is &s;aid to them; to whom Nature hath neither indulged the offen&s;ive nor defen&s;ive Weapons of Deceit, and who are con&s;equently liable to be impo&s;ed upon by any one, who will only be at the Expence of a little Fal|&s;hood for that Purpo&s;e. Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> having drain|ed Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> of all &s;he knew, which indeed was but little, but which was &s;ufficient to make the Aunt &s;u&s;pect a great deal, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, with A&s;&s;urances that <HI>Sophia</HI> would not &s;ee her, that &s;he would &s;end no An&s;wer to the Letter, nor ever receive another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor did &s;he &s;uffer her to depart, without a hand&s;ome Lecture on the Merits of an Office, to which &s;he could afford no better Name than that of Procu+re&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>This di&s;covery had greatly di&s;compo&s;ed her Tem+per, when coming into the Apartment, next to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in which the Lovers were, &s;he overheard <HI>Sophia</HI> very warmly prote&s;ting again&s;t his Lord&s;hip's Addre&s;&s;es.

Now it is well known, that all Jokes and Raillery are at this Time laid a&s;ide; what|ever Characters any of the Pa&s;&s;engers have for the le&s;t &s;ake per&s;onated on the Road, are now thrown off, and the Conver&s;ation is u&s;ually plain and &s;erious.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Manner, if I have now and then, in the Cour&s;e of this Work, indulged any Plea&s;antry for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">y entertainment, I &s;hall here lay it down. The Va|riety of Matter, indeed, which I &s;hall be obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">am into this Book, will afford no room for any of tho&s;e ludicrous Ob&s;ervations which I have el&s;ewhere made, and which may &s;ometimes, perhaps, have pre|vented thee from taking a Nap when it was beginning to &s;teal upon thee. In this la&s;t Book thou wilt find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">thing (or at mo&s;t very little) of that Nature. All will be plain Narrative only; and, indeed, when thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t peru&s;ed the many great Events which this Book will produce, thou wilt think the Number of Pages contained in it &s;carce &s;ufficient to tell the Story.</P>
<P>And now, my Friend, I take this Opportunity (as I &s;hall have no other) of heartily wi&s;hing thee well. If I have been an entertaining Companion to thee, I promi&s;e thee it is what I have de&s;ired. If in any Thing I have offended, it was really without any In|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ention. Some Things perhaps here &s;aid, may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t thee or thy Friends; but I do mo&s;t &s;olemnly de|clare they were not pointed at them. I que&s;tion not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut thou ha&s;t been told, among other Stories of me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hat thou wa&s;t to travel with a very &s;currilous Fellow: But whoever told thee &s;o, did me an Injury.

<P>All the&s;e Works, however, I am well convinced will be dead long before this Page &s;hall offer it&s;elf to thy Peru&s;al: For however &s;hort the Period may be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> my own Performances, they will mo&s;t probably out live their own infirm Author, and the weakly Pro+ductions of his abu&s;ive Cotemporaries.</P>

<P>WHILE <HI>Jones</HI> was employed in the&s;e unplea+&s;ant Meditations, with which we left him tor+menting him&s;elf, <HI>Partridge</HI> came &s;tumbling into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Room with his Face paler than A&s;hes, his Eyes fixe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his Head, his Hair &s;tanding an End, and ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Limb trembling.

<P><HI>Jones,</HI> who was little &s;ubject to Fear, could not a+void being &s;omewhat &s;hocked at this &s;udden Appear+ance.

<P>Upon the&s;e Words, <HI>Jones</HI> became in a Moment a greater Picture of Horror than <HI>Partridge</HI> him&s;elf. He was indeed, for &s;ome Time, &s;truck dumb with Amaze|ment, and both &s;tood &s;taring wildly at each other.

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> having received the Letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold it, and indeed had &s;carce the U&s;e of any one of his Faculties) <HI>Partridge</HI> took it up, and having received Con&s;ent by Silence, read it likewi&s;e; nor had it upon him a le&s;s &s;en&s;ible Effect. The Pencil, and not the Pen, &s;hould de&s;cribe the Hor|rors which appeared in both their Countenances. While they both remained &s;peechle&s;s, the Turnkey entered the Room, and without taking any Notice of what &s;ufficiently di&s;covered it&s;elf in the Faces of them both, acquainted <HI>Jones</HI> that a Man without de&s;ired to &s;peak with him. This Per&s;on was pre&s;ently introdu|ced, and was no other than Black <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>As Sights of Horror were not &s;o u&s;ual to <HI>George</HI> as they were to the Turnkey, he in&s;tantly &s;aw the great Di&s;order which appeared in the Face of <HI>Jones.</HI> This he imputed to the Accident that happened, which was reported in the very wor&s;t Light in Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s Family; he concluded therefore that the Gentleman was dead, and that Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was in a fair Way of coming to a &s;hameful End. A Thought which gave him much Unea&s;ine&s;s; for <HI>George</HI> was of a compa&s;|&s;ionate Di&s;po&s;ition, and notwith&s;tanding a &s;mall Breach of Friend&s;hip which he had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not in&s;en&s;ible of the Obligations he had formerly received from Mr. <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Fellow therefore &s;carce refrained from a Tear at the pre&s;ent Sight. He told <HI>Jones</HI> he was heartily &s;orry for his Misfortunes, and begged him to

<P>The re&s;t of the Conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed at the Vi&s;it is not important enough to be here related. The Reader will therefore forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be plea&s;ed to hear how this great good Will of the Squire towards his Daughter was brought about.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> on her fir&s;t Arrival at her Brother's Lodging, began to &s;et forth the great Honours and Advantages which would accrue to the Family by the Match with Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> which her Neice had ab|&s;olutely refu&s;ed; in which Refu&s;al, when the Squire took the Part of his Daughter, &s;he fell immediately into the mo&s;t violent Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o irritated and pro|voked the Squire, that neither his Patience nor his Prudence could bear any longer; upon which there en&s;ued between them both &s;o warm a Bout at Alter|cation, that perhaps the Regions of <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> ne|ver equalled it. In the Heat of this Scolding Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> departed, and had con&s;equently no Lei&s;ure to acquaint the Brother with the Letter which <HI>Sophia</HI> re|ceived, which might have po&s;&s;ibly produced ill Ef|fects; but to &s;ay the Truth I believe it never once occurred to her Memory at this Time.</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was gone, <HI>Sophia,</HI> who had been hitherto &s;ilent, as well indeed from Nece&s;&s;ity as Inclination, began to return the Compliment which
<PB N="288" REF="293">
her Father had made her, in taking her part again&s;t her Aunt, by taking his likewi&s;e again&s;t the Lady. This was the fir&s;t Time of her &s;o doing, and it was in the highe&s;t Degree acceptable to the Squire. Again he remembered that Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had in&s;i&s;ted on an en|tire Relinqui&s;hment of all violent Means; and indeed as he made no doubt but that <HI>Jones</HI> would be hanged he did not in the lea&s;t que&s;tion &s;ucceeding with his Daughter by fair Means; he now therefore once more gave a Loo&s;e to his natural Fondne&s;s for her, which had &s;uch an Effect on the Dutiful, grateful, tender and Affectionate Heart of <HI>Sophia,</HI> that had her Honour given to <HI>Jones,</HI> and &s;omething el&s;e perhaps in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether &s;he would not have &s;acrificed her&s;elf to a Man &s;he did not like, to have obliged her Father. She promi&s;ed him &s;he would make it the whole Bu|&s;ine&s;s of her Life to oblige him, and would never marry any Man again&s;t his Con&s;ent; which brought the old Man &s;o near to his highe&s;t Happine&s;s, that he was re&s;olved to take the other Step, and went to Bed completely drunk.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Allworthy <HI>vi&s;its old</HI> Nightingale; <HI>with a &s;trange Di&s;|covery that he made on that Occa&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Morning after the&s;e Things had happened, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> went according to his Promi&s;e to vi&s;it old <HI>Nightingale,</HI> with whom his Authority was &s;o great, that after having &s;at with him three Hours, he at la&s;t prevailed with him to con&s;ent to &s;ee his Son.</P>
<P>Here an Accident happened of a very extraordina|ry Kind; one indeed of tho&s;e &s;trange Chances, whence very good and grave Men have concluded that Providence often interpo&s;es in the Di&s;covery of
<PB N="289" REF="294">
the mo&s;t &s;ecret Villainy, in order to caution Men from quitting the Paths of Hone&s;ty, however warily they tread in tho&s;e of Vice.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> at his Entrance into Mr. <HI>Night|ingale'</HI>s, &s;aw black <HI>George;</HI> he took no Notice of him, nor did Black <HI>George</HI> imagine he had perceived him. However, when their Conver&s;ation on the principal Point was over, <HI>Allworthy</HI> a&s;ked <HI>Nightingale</HI> whether he knew one <HI>George Seagrim,</HI> and upon what Bu&s;ine&s;s he came to his Hou&s;e. <Q REND="inline">'Yes, an&s;wer|ed <HI>Nightingale,</HI> I know him very well, and a mo&s;t extraordinary Fellow he is, who in the&s;e Days, hath been able to hoard up <HI>500l.</HI> from renting a very &s;mall E&s;tate of <HI>30l.</HI> a Year.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'And is this the Story he hath told you? cries <HI>Allworthy.'</HI></Q> <Q REND="inline">'Nay, it is true, I promi&s;e you,' &s;aid <HI>Nightingale,</HI> 'for I have the Money now in my Hands, in five Bank Bills, which I am to lay out either in a Mortgage, or in &s;ome Purcha&s;e in the North of <HI>England.</HI>'</Q> The Bank Bills were no &s;ooner produced at <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s De&s;ire, than he ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf at the Strangene&s;s of the Di&s;covery. He pre&s;ently told <HI>Nightingale</HI> that the&s;e Bank Bills were formerly his, and then acquaint|ed him with the whole Affair. As there are no Men who complain more of the Frauds of Bu&s;ine&s;s than Highwaymen, Game&s;ters, and other Thieves of that Kind; &s;o there are none who &s;o bitterly exclaim a|gain&s;t the Frauds of Game&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as U&s;urers, Bro|kers, and other Thieves of this Kind; whether it be that the one Way of cheating is a Di&s;countenance or Reflection upon the other, or that Money, which is the common Mi&s;tre&s;s of all Cheats, makes them re|gard each other in the Light of Rivals; but <HI>Nightin|gale</HI> no &s;ooner heard the Story, than he exclaimed again&s;t the Fellow in Terms much &s;everer than the Ju&s;tice and Hone&s;ty of <HI>Allworthy</HI> had be&s;towed on him.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="295">
<HI>Allworthy</HI> de&s;ired <HI>Nightingale</HI> to retain both the Money and the Secret till he &s;hould hear farther from him; and if he &s;hould in the mean Time &s;ee the Fel|low, that he would not take the lea&s;t Notice to him of the Di&s;covery which he had made. He then re|turned to his Lodgings, where he found Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> in a very dejected Condition, on Account of the In|formation &s;he had received from her Son-in-law. Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> with great Chearfulne&s;s, told her that he had much good News to communicate; and with little further Preface, acquainted her, that he had brought Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> to con&s;ent to &s;ee his Son, and did not in the lea&s;t doubt to effect a perfect Re|conciliation between them; though he found the Fa|ther more &s;owered by another Accident of the &s;ame Kind, which had happened in his Family. He then mentioned the running away of the Uncle's Daugh|ter, which he had been told by the old Gentleman, and which Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and her Son-in-law, did not yet know.</P>
<P>The Reader may &s;uppo&s;e Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> received this Account with great Thankfulne&s;s and no le&s;s Plea|&s;ure; but &s;o uncommon was her Friend&s;hip to <HI>Jones,</HI> that I am not certain whether the Unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;uf|fered for his Sake, did not over-ballance her Satis|faction at hearing a Piece of News tending &s;o much to the Happine&s;s of her own Family; nor whether even this very News, as it reminded her of the Ob|ligations &s;he had to <HI>Jones,</HI> did not hurt as well as plea&s;e her; when her grateful Heart &s;aid to her, <Q REND="inline">'While my own Family is happy, how mi&s;erable is the poor Creature, to who&s;e Genero&s;ity we owe the Beginning of all this Happine&s;s.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> having left her a little while to chew the Cud (if I may u&s;e that Expre&s;&s;ion) on the&s;e fir&s;t Tid|ings, told her, he had &s;till &s;omething more to impart, which he believed would give her Plea&s;ure. <Q REND="inline">'I think &s;aid he, I have di&s;covered a pretty con&s;iderable Trea|&s;ure

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Containing two Letters in very different Stiles.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My worthy Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I informed you in my la&s;t, that I was forbidden the U&s;e of the Waters, as they were found by Experience rather to encrea&s;e than le&s;&s;en the Symp|toms of my Di&s;temper. I mu&s;t now acquaint you with a Piece of News, which, I believe, will afflict my Friends more than it hath afflicted me. Dr. <HI>Harrington</HI> and Dr. <HI>Brew&s;ter,</HI> have informed me, that there is no Hopes of my Recovery.</P>
<P>I have &s;omewhere read, that the great U&s;e of Philo&s;ophy is to learn to die. I will not therefore &s;o far di&s;grace mine, as to &s;hew any Surprize at receiving a Le&s;&s;on which I mu&s;t be thought to have &s;o long &s;tudied. Yet, to &s;ay the Truth, one Page of the Go&s;pel teaches this Le&s;&s;on better than all the Volumes of antient or modern Philo&s;ophers. The A&s;&s;urance it gives us of another Life is a much &s;tronger &s;upport to a good Mind, than all the Con&s;olations that are drawn from the Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature, the Emptine&s;s or Satiety of our Enjoy|ments here, or any other Topic of tho&s;e Decla|mations which are &s;ometimes capable of arming our Minds with a &s;tubborn Patience in bearing the Thoughts of Death; but never of rai&s;ing them to a real Contempt of it, and much le&s;s of making us think it a real Good. I would not here be under&s;tood to throw the horrid Cen&s;ure of Athei&s;m, or even the ab&s;olute Denial of Immortality, on all who are called Philo&s;ophers. Many of that Sect, as|well antient as modern, have, from the Light of Rea&s;on, di&s;covered &s;ome Hopes of a future State; but, in Reality, that Light was &s;o faint and glim|mering,
<PB N="295" REF="300">
and the Hopes were &s;o incertain and pre|carious, that it may be ju&s;tly doubted on which Side their Belief turned. <HI>Plato</HI> him&s;elf conludes his <HI>Phaedon,</HI> with declaring that his be&s;t Argu|ments amount only to rai&s;e a Probability, and <HI>Ci|cero</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems rather to profe&s;s an Inclination to believe, than any actual Belief in the Doctrines of Immortality. As to my&s;elf to be very &s;incere with you, I never was much in earne&s;t in this Faith, till I was in earne&s;t a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>You will perhaps wonder at the latter Expre&s;&s;i|on; but I a&s;&s;ure you it hath not been till very lately, that I could, with Truth, call my&s;elf &s;o. The Pride of Philo&s;ophy had intoxicated my Rea&s;on, and the &s;ublime&s;t of all Wi&s;dom appeared to me, as it did to the <HI>Greeks</HI> of old, to be Fooli&s;hne&s;s. God hath however been &s;o gracious to &s;hew me my Error in Time, and to bring me into the Way of Truth, before I &s;unk into utter Darkne&s;s for ever.</P>
<P>I find my&s;elf beginning to grow very weak, I &s;hall therefore ha&s;ten to the main Purpo&s;e of this Letter.</P>
<P>When I reflect on the Actions of my pa&s;t Life, I know of nothing which &s;its heavier upon my Con&s;cience, than the Inju&s;tice I have been guilty of to that poor Wretch, your adopted Son. I have not indeed only connived at the Villany of others, but been my&s;elf active in Inju&s;tice towards him. Believe me, my dear Friend, when I tell you on the Word of a dying Man, he has been ba&s;ely injured. As to the principal Fact, upon the Mi&s;repre&s;entation of which you di&s;carded him, I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you he is innocent. When you lay upon your &s;uppo&s;ed Death-bed, he was the only Per&s;on in the Hou&s;e who te&s;tified any real Concern; and what happened afterwards aro&s;e from the Wildne&s;s of his Joy on your Recovery;
<PB N="296" REF="301">
and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, from the Ba&s;ene&s;s of another Per&s;on (but it is my De&s;ire to ju&s;tify the Innocent, and to accu&s;e none). Believe me, my Friend, this young Man hath the noble&s;t Genero|&s;ity of Heart, the mo&s;t perfect Capacity for Friend|&s;hip, the highe&s;t Integrity, and indeed every Vir|tue which can ennoble a Man. He hath &s;ome Faults, but among them is not to be numbred the lea&s;t want of Duty or Gratitude towards you. On the contrary I am &s;atisfied when you di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from your Hou&s;e, his Heart bled for you more than for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Worldly Motives were the wicked and ba&s;e Rea|&s;ons of my concealing this from you &s;o long; to reveal it now I can have no Inducement but the De&s;ire of &s;erving the Cau&s;e of Truth, of doing Right to the Innocent, and of making all the A|mends in my Power for a pa&s;t Offence. I hope this Declaration therefore will have the Effect de|&s;ired, and will re&s;tore this de&s;erving young Man to your Favour; the hearing of which while I am yet alive will afford the utmo&s;t Con&s;olation to,</P>

<P>The Reader will, after this, &s;carce wonder at the Revolution &s;o vi&s;ibly appearing in Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> not|with&s;tanding he received from <HI>Thwackum,</HI> by the &s;ame Po&s;t, another Letter of a very different Kind, which we &s;hall here add, as it may po&s;&s;ibly be the la&s;t Time we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention the Name of that Gentleman.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>

Mr. <HI>Square</HI> the Athei&s;t's young Pupil. I &s;hall not wonder at any Murders he may commit; and I heartily pray that your own Blood may not &s;eal up his final Commitment to the Place of Wailing and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</P>
<P>Though you cannot want &s;ufficient Calls to Re|pentance for the many unwarrantable Weakne&s;&s;es exemplified in your Behaviour to this Wretch, &s;o much to the Prejudice of your own lawful Family, and of your Character. I &s;ay, tho' the&s;e may &s;uf|ficiently be &s;uppo&s;ed to prick and goad your Con|&s;cience at this Sea&s;on; I &s;hould yet be wanting to my Duty, if I &s;pared to give you &s;ome Admoni|tion in order to bring you to a due Sen&s;e of your Errors. I therefore pray you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the Judgment which is likely to overtake this wick|ed Villain; and let it &s;erve at lea&s;t as a Warning to you, that you may not for the future de&s;pi&s;e the Advice of one who is indefatigable in his Prayers for your Welfare.</P>
<P>Had not my Hand been withheld from due Cor|rection, I had &s;courged much of this diabolical Spirit out of a Boy, of whom from his Infancy I di&s;covered the Devil had taken &s;uch entire Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion; but Reflections of this Kind now come too late.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry you have given away the Living of <HI>We&s;terton</HI> &s;o ha&s;tily. I &s;hould have applied on that Occa&s;ion earlier, had I thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the Di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;Your Objection to Pluralities is being righteous over-much. If there were any Crime in the Prac|tice, &s;o many godly Men would not agree to it. If the Vicar of <HI>Aldergrove</HI> &s;hould die (as we hear he is in a declining Way) I hope you will think of me, &s;ince I am certain you mu&s;t be convinced of my mo&s;t &s;incere Attachment to your highe&s;t Welfare.

<P>As a conquered Rebellion &s;trengthens a Govern|ment, or as Health is more perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed by Recovery from &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;o Anger, when re|moved, often gives new Life to Affection. This was the Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Allworthy;</HI> for <HI>Blifil</HI> having wiped off the greater Su&s;picion, the le&s;&s;er, which had been rai&s;ed by <HI>Square'</HI>s Letter, &s;unk of Cour&s;e, and was forgotten; and <HI>Thwackum,</HI> with whom he was great|ly offended, bore alone all the Reflections which <HI>Square</HI> had ca&s;t on the Enemies of <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>As for that young Man, the Re&s;entment of Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> began more and more to abate towards him. He told <HI>Blifil,</HI> <Q REND="inline">'he did not only forgive the extraordinary Efforts of his Good-Nature, but would give him the Plea&s;ure of following his Ex|ample.'</Q> Then turning to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> with a Smile which would have become an Angel, he cry'd, <Q REND="inline">'What &s;ay you, Madam; &s;hall we take a Hackney-Coach, and all of us together pay a Vi&s;it to your Friend?

<P>Every Reader, I believe, will be able to an&s;wer for the worthy Woman; but they mu&s;t have a great deal of Good-Nature, and be well acquainted with Friend&s;hip, who can feel what &s;he felt on this Occa|&s;ion.

<P>The poor Woman, who was almo&s;t deprived of her Sen&s;es at this dreadful News, was never le&s;s cap|able of Invention than at pre&s;ent.

<P>Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> then a&s;ked him many Que&s;tions con|cerning <HI>Jones,</HI> as to his Health and other Matters; to all which <HI>Partridge</HI> an&s;wered, without having the lea&s;t Regard to what was, but con&s;idered only what he would have Things appear; for a &s;trict Adherence to Truth was not among the Articles of this hone&s;t Fel|low's Morality or his Religion.</P>

It was then contrived, that my Mother and my&s;elf only &s;hould attend at the Time, and that Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent out of the Way, as &s;he accordingly was to the very furthe&s;t Part of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> to en|quire the Character of a Servant; for the Lady had turned away her own Maid near three Months be|fore, during all which Time I officiated about her Per&s;on, upon Trial as &s;he &s;aid, tho', as &s;he after|wards declared, I was not &s;ufficiently handy for the Place. This and many other &s;uch Things which &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay of me, were all thrown out to prevent any Su&s;picion which <HI>Wilkins</HI> might here|after have when I was to own the Child; for &s;he thought it could never be believed &s;he would venture to hurt a young Woman with whom &s;he had intru&s;ted &s;uch a Secret. You may be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, I was well paid for all the&s;e Affronts, which, together with being informed of the Occa&s;ion of them, very well contented me. Indeed the Lady had a greater Su&s;picion of Mrs. <HI>Wilkins</HI> than of any other Per&s;on; not that &s;he had the lea&s;t Aver&s;ion to the Gentlewoman, but &s;he thought her incapable of keeping a Secret, e&s;pecially from you, Sir: For I have often heard Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> &s;ay, that if Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> had committed a Murder, &s;he believ|ed

&s;he would acquaint you with it. At la&s;t the expected Day came, and Mrs. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who had been kept a Week in Readine&s;s, and put off from Time to Time, upon &s;ome Pretence or other, that &s;he might not return too &s;oon, was di&s;patched. Then the Child was born in the Pre&s;ence only of my|&s;elf and my Mother, and was by my Mother conveyed to her own Hou&s;e, where it was privately kept by her till the Evening of your Return, when I, by the Command of Mi&s;s <HI>Bridget</HI> conveyed it into the Bed where you found it.' And all Su&s;picions were afterwards laid a&s;leep by the artful Conduct of your Si&s;ter, in pretending Ill-will to the Boy, and that any Regard &s;he &s;hew'd him was out of meer Com|plai&s;ance to you.'</Q> Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> then made many Pro|te&s;tations of the Truth of this Story, and conclud|ed by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'Thus, Sir, you have at la&s;t di&s;co|vered your Nephew, for &s;o I am &s;ure you will here|after think him, and I que&s;tion not but he will be both an Honour and a Comfort to you under that Appel|lation.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I need not Madam, &s;aid <HI>Allworthy,</HI> expre&s;s my A&s;toni&s;hment at what you have told me; and yet &s;urely you would not, and could not, have put together &s;o many Circum&s;tances to evidence an Untruth.

No &s;ooner then was <HI>We&s;tern</HI> informed of Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Intention to make <HI>Jones</HI> his Heir, than he joined heartily with the Uncle in every Commendation of the Nephew, and became as eager for her Marriage with <HI>Jones,</HI> as he had before been to couple her to <HI>Blifil.</HI></P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> was again forced to interpo&s;e, and to relate what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and <HI>So|phia,</HI> at which he te&s;tified great Surprize.</P>
<P>The Squire was &s;ilent a Moment, and looked wild with A&s;toni&s;hment at this Account&mdash;At la&s;t he cried out, <Q REND="inline">'Why what can be the Meaning of this, Neighbour <HI>Allworthy?</HI> Vond o un &s;he was, that I'll be &s;worn to.&mdash;Odzookers! I have hit o't. As &s;ure as a Gun I have hit o the very right o't. It's all long o Zi&s;ter. The Girl hath got a Hanker|ing after this Son of a whore of a Lord. I vound 'em together at my Cou&s;in, my Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton'</HI>s. He hath turned the Head o' her that's certain&mdash;but d&mdash;n me if he &s;hall ha her&mdash;I'll ha no Lords nor Courtiers in my Vamily.'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> now made a long Speech, in which he repeated his Re&s;olution to avoid all violent Mea&s;ures, and very earne&s;tly recommended gentle Methods to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> as tho&s;e by which he might be a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucceeding be&s;t with his Daughter. He then took his Leave, and returned back to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> but
<PB N="335" REF="340">
was forced to comply with the earne&s;t Entreaties of the Squire, in promi&s;ing to bring Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to vi&s;it him that Afternoon, <Q REND="inline">'that he might,' as he &s;aid, 'make all Matters up with the young Gentleman.'</Q> At Mr. <HI>Allworthy'</HI>s Departure, <HI>We&s;tern</HI> promi&s;ed to follow his Advice in his Behaviour to <HI>Sophia,</HI> &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">'I don't know how 'tis, but d&mdash;n me, <HI>Allwor|thy,</HI> if you don't make me always do ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, and yet I have as good an E&s;teate as you, and am in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace as well as your&s;elf.'</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Wherein the Hi&s;tory begins to draw towards a Con|clu&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Allworthy</HI> returned to his Lodgings, he heard Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was ju&s;t arrived before him. He hurried therefore in&s;tantly into an empty Cham|ber, whither he ordered Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> to be brought to him alone.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive a more tender or mov|ing Scene, than the Meeting between the Uncle and Nephew, (for Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> as the Reader may well &s;uppo&s;e, had at her la&s;t Vi&s;it di&s;covered to him the Secret of his Birth). The fir&s;t Agonies of Joy which were felt on both Sides, are indeed beyond my Pow|er to de&s;cribe: I &s;hall not therefore attempt it. Af|ter <HI>Allworthy</HI> had rai&s;ed <HI>Jones</HI> from his Feet, where he had pro&s;trated him&s;elf, and received him into his Arms, <Q REND="inline">'O my Child,' he cried, 'how have I been to blame! How have I injured you!

The wi&s;e&s;t Man might be deceived as you were, and, under &s;uch a Deception, the be&s;t mu&s;t have acted ju&s;t as you did. Your Goodne&s;s di&s;played it|&s;elf in the Mid&s;t of your Anger, ju&s;t as it then &s;eem|ed. I owe every thing to that Goodne&s;s of which I have been mo&s;t unworthy. Do not put me on Self-accu&s;ation, by carrying your generous Sentiments too far. Alas, Sir, I have not been puni&s;hed more than I have de&s;erved; and it &s;hall be the whole Bu|&s;ine&s;s of my furture Life to de&s;erve that Happine&s;s you now be&s;tow on me; for believe me, my dear Uncle, my Puni&s;hment hath not been thrown away upon me. Though I have been a great, I am not a hardened Sinner; I thank Heaven I have had Time to reflect on my pa&s;t Life, where though I cannot charge my&s;elf with any gro&s;s Villainy, yet I can di&s;|cern Follies and Vices too &s;ufficient to repent and to be a&s;hamed of; Follies which have been attended with dreadful Con&s;equences to my&s;elf, and have brought me to the Brink of De&s;truction.'</Q> <Q REND="inline">'I am rejoiced, my dear Child,' an&s;wered <HI>Allworthy,</HI> to hear you talk thus &s;en&s;ibly; for as I am convinc|ed Hypocri&s;y (good Heaven how have I been impo&s;ed on by it in others!) was never among your Faults,

&s;o I can readily believe all you &s;ay. You now &s;ee, <HI>Tom,</HI> to what Dangers Imprudence alone may &s;ub|ject Virtue (for Virtue, I am now convinced, you love in a great Degree). Prudence is indeed the Duty which we owe to our&s;elves; and if we will be &s;o much our own Enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the World is deficient in di&s;charg|ing their Duty to us; for when a Man lays the Foundation of his own Ruin, others will, I am a|fraid, be too apt to build upon it. You &s;ay, how|ever you have &s;een your Errors; and will reform them. I firmly believe you, my dear Child; and therefore, from this Moment, you &s;hall never more be reminded of them by me. Remember them on|ly your&s;elf &s;o far, as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them; but &s;till remember, for your Comfort, that there is this great Difference between tho&s;e Faults which Candour may con&s;true into Im|prudence, and tho&s;e which can be deduced from Vil|lainy only. The former, perhaps, are even more liable to &s;ubject a Man to Ruin; but if he reform, his Character will, at length, be totally retrieved; the World, though not immediately, will, in Time, be reconciled to him; and he may reflect, not with|out &s;ome Mixture of Plea&s;ure, on the Dangers he hath e&s;caped: But Villainy, my Boy, when once di&s;covered, is irretrievable; the Stains which this leaves behind, no Time will wa&s;h away. The Cen|&s;ure of Mankind will pur&s;ue the Wretch, their Scorn will aba&s;h him in Public, and if Shame drives him into Retirement, he will go to it with all tho&s;e Terrors with which a weary Child, who is afraid of Hobgoblins, retreats from Company to go to Bed alone. Here his murdered Con&s;cience will haunt him. Repo&s;e, like a fal&s;e Friend, will fly from him.

Comfort your&s;elf, I &s;ay, my Child, that this is not your Ca&s;e; and rejoice, with Thankfulne&s;s to him who hath &s;uffered you to &s;ee your Errors, before they have brought on you that De&s;truction to which a Per&s;i|&s;tance in even tho&s;e Errors mu&s;t have led you.

<P>A Servant now acquainted them, that Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was below Stairs; for his Eagerne&s;s to &s;ee <HI>Jones</HI> could not wait till the Afternoon. Upon which <HI>Jones,</HI> who&s;e Eyes were full of Tears, begged his Uncle to entertain <HI>We&s;tern</HI> a few Minutes, till he a little reco|vered him&s;elf: To which the good Man con&s;ented, and having ordered Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> to be &s;hewn into a Parlour, went down to him.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> no &s;ooner heard, that <HI>Jones</HI> was alone (for &s;he had not yet &s;een him &s;ince his Relea&s;e from Pri&s;on,) than &s;he came eagerly into the Room, and, advancing towards <HI>Jones,</HI> wi&s;hed him heartily Joy of his new-found Uncle, and his happy Reconciliation; adding, <Q REND="inline">'I wi&s;h I could give you Joy on another Ac|count, my dear Child; but any thing &s;o inexorable I never &s;aw.'</Q> <HI>Jones,</HI> with &s;ome Appearance of Sur|prize, a&s;ked her, what &s;he meant. <Q REND="inline">'Why then,' &s;ays &s;he, 'I have been with your young Lady, and

I told her the very Rea&s;on of &s;ending the Letter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her Account, and a plain Proof, that you was re&s;olved to quit all your Profligacy for the fu|ture; that you had never been guilty of a &s;ingle In|&s;tance of Infidelity to her &s;ince your &s;eeing her in Town. I am afraid I went too far there; but Hea|ven forgive me: I hope your future Behaviour will be my Ju&s;tification. I am &s;ure I have &s;aid all I can; but all to no Purpo&s;e.

<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>This Hi&s;tory draws nearer to a Conclu&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was departed, <HI>Jones</HI> be|gan to inform Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Mil|ler,</HI> that his Liberty had been procured by two noble Lords, who, together with two Surgeons, and a Friend of Mr. <HI>Nightingale'</HI>s, had attended the Ma|gi&s;trate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on the Surgeons Oaths that the wounded Per|&s;on was out of all Manner of Danger from this Wound, he was di&s;charged.</P>
<P>One only of the&s;e Lords, he &s;aid, he had ever &s;een before, and that no more than once; but the o|ther had greatly &s;urprized him, by a&s;king his Pardon for an Offence he had been guilty of towards him, occa&s;ioned, he &s;aid, entirely by his Ignorance who he was.</P>
<P>Now the Reality of the Ca&s;e with which <HI>Jones</HI> was not acquainted till afterwards, was this. The Lieu|tenant whom Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> had employed, accord|ing to the Advice of Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton,</HI> to pre&s;s <HI>Jones,</HI> as a Vagabond, into the Sea Service, when he came to report the Event which we have before &s;een to his Lord&s;hip, &s;poke very favourably of the Behavi|our of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> on all Accounts, and &s;trongly a&s;|&s;ured
<PB N="343" REF="348">
that Lord, that he mu&s;t have mi&s;taken the Per|&s;on, for that <HI>Jones</HI> was certainly a Gentleman, in|&s;omuch that his Lord&s;hip, who was &s;trictly a Man of Honour, and would by no Means have been guilty of an Action which the World in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for the Ad|vice which he had taken.</P>
<P>Within a Day or two after this, Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> happened to dine with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer, who, in a Con|ver&s;ation upon the Duel, acquainted his Company with the Character of <HI>Fitzpatrick;</HI> to which indeed he did not do &s;trict Ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially in what related to his Lady. He &s;aid, &s;he was the mo&s;t innocent, and mo&s;t injured Woman alive, and that from Com|pa&s;&s;ion alone he had undertaken her Cau&s;e. He then declared an Intention of going the next Morning to <HI>Fitzpatrick'</HI>s Lodgings, in order to prevail with him, if po&s;&s;ibly, to con&s;ent to a Separation from his Wife, who, the Peer &s;aid, was in Apprehen&s;ions for her Life, if &s;he &s;hould ever return to be under the Power of her Hu&s;band. Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> agreed to go with him, that he might &s;atisfy him&s;elf more concerning <HI>Jones,</HI> and the Circum&s;tances of the Duel; for he was by no Means ea&s;y concerning the Part he had acted. The Moment his Lord&s;hip gave a Hint of his Rea|dine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Delivery of the Lady, it was eagerly embraced by the other Nobleman, who de|pended much on the Authority of Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe <HI>Fitz|patrick</HI> into a Compliance; and perhaps he was in the right; for the poor <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw the&s;e no|ble Peers had undertaken the Cau&s;e of his Wife, than he &s;ubmitted, and Articles of Separation were &s;oon drawn up and &s;igned between the Parties.</P>
<P><HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> had been &s;o well &s;atisfied by Mrs. <HI>Wa|ters</HI> concerning the Innocence of his Wife with <HI>Jones</HI> at <HI>Upton,</HI> or perhaps from &s;ome other Rea&s;ons, was now become &s;o indifferent to that Matter, that he
<PB N="344" REF="349">
&s;poke highly in Favour of <HI>Jones,</HI> to Lord <HI>Fellamar,</HI> took all the Blame upon him&s;elf, and &s;aid the other had behaved very much like a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour; and upon that Lord's further En|quiry concerning Mr. <HI>Jones, Fitzpatrick</HI> told him he was Nephew to a Gentleman of very great Fa&s;hion and Fortune, which was the Account he had ju&s;t re|ceived from Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> after her Interview with <HI>Dowling.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Fellamar</HI> now thought it behoved him to do every Thing in his Power to make Satisfaction to a Gentleman whom he had &s;o gro&s;ly injured, and with|out any Con&s;ideration of Rival&s;hip, (for he had now given over all Thoughts of <HI>Sophia)</HI> determined to procure Mr. <HI>Jones'</HI>s Liberty, being &s;atisfied as well from <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> as his Surgeon, that the Wound was not mortal. He therefore prevailed with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer to accompany him to the Place where <HI>Jones</HI> was confined, to whom he behaved as we have already related.</P>
<P>When <HI>Allworthy</HI> returned to his Lodgings, he im|mediately carried <HI>Jones</HI> into his Room, and then ac|quainted him with the whole Matter, as well what he had heard from Mrs. <HI>Waters,</HI> as what he had di&s;|covered from Mr. <HI>Dowling.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> expre&s;&s;ed great A&s;toni&s;hment, and no le&s;s Concern at this Account; but without making any Comment or Ob&s;ervation upon it. And now a Me&s;|&s;age was brought from Mr. <HI>Blifil,</HI> de&s;iring to know if his Uncle was at Lei&s;ure, and he might wait upon him. <HI>Alworthy</HI> &s;tarted and turned pale, and then in a more pa&s;&s;ionate Tone than, I believe, he had ever u&s;ed before, bid the Servant tell <HI>Blifil,</HI> he knew him not. <Q REND="inline">'Con&s;ider, dear Sir,'</Q>&mdash;cries <HI>Jones</HI> in a trem|bling Voice.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'I have con&s;idered, an&s;wered <HI>All|worthy,</HI> and you your&s;elf &s;hall carry my Me&s;&s;age to the Villain.&mdash;No one can carry him the Sentence

<P>Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> entring the Room at that Moment, after a gentle Rap, which was not perceived, and &s;ee|ing <HI>Jones</HI> in the Arms of his Uncle, the poor Wo|man, in an Agony of Joy, fell upon her Knees, and bur&s;t forth into the mo&s;t extatic Thank&s;givings to Heaven, for what had happened. &mdash;Then run|ing to <HI>Jones,</HI> &s;he embraced him eagerly, crying, <Q REND="inline">'My deare&s;t Friend, I wi&s;h you Joy a Thou&s;and and a Thou&s;and Times of this ble&s;t Day;'</Q> and next Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> him&s;elf received the &s;ame Congratulations.

<P><HI>Jones</HI> went up to <HI>Blifil'</HI>s Room, whom he found in a Situation which moved his Pity, though it would have rai&s;ed a le&s;s amiable Pa&s;&s;ion in many Beholders. He had ca&s;t him&s;elf on his Bed, where he lay aban|doning him&s;elf to De&s;pair, and drowned in Tears; not in &s;uch Tears as flow from Contrition, and wa&s;h away Guilt from Minds which have been &s;educed or &s;urprized into it unawares, again&s;t the Bent of their natural Di&s;po&s;itions, as will &s;ometimes happen from human Frailty, even to the Good: No, the&s;e Tears were &s;uch as the frighted Thief &s;heds in his Cart, and are indeed the Effects of that Concern which the mo&s;t &s;avage Natures are &s;eldom deficient in feeling for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It would be unplea&s;ant and tedious to paint this Scene in full Length. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that the Behaviour of <HI>Jones</HI> was kind to Exce&s;s. He omitted nothing which his Invention could &s;upply, to rai&s;e and comfort the drooping Spirits of <HI>Blifil,</HI> before he communicated to him the Re&s;olution of his Uncle, that he mu&s;t quit the Hou&s;e that Evening. He offer|ed to furni&s;h him with any Money he wanted, a&s;&s;ur|ed him of his hearty Forgivene&s;s of all he had done again&s;t him, that he would endeavour to live with him hereafter as a Brother, and would leave nothing un|attempted to effectuate a Reconciliation with his Un|cle.</P>
<P><HI>Blifil</HI> was at fir&s;t &s;ullen and &s;ilent, balancing in his Mind whether he &s;hould yet deny all: But finding at la&s;t the Evidence too &s;trong again&s;t him, he betook him&s;elf at la&s;t to confe&s;&s;ion. He then a&s;ked Pardon of his Brother in the mo&s;t vehement Manner, pro|&s;trated

him&s;elf on the Ground, and ki&s;&s;ed his Feet: In &s;hort, he was now as remarkably mean, as he had been before remarkably wicked.</P>
<P><HI>Jones</HI> could not &s;o far check his Di&s;dain, but that it a little di&s;covered it&s;elf in his Countenance at this extreme Servility. He rai&s;ed his Brother the Moment he could from the Ground, and advi&s;ed him to bear his Afflictions more like a Man; repeating, at the &s;ame Time, his Promi&s;es, that he would do all in his Power to le&s;&s;en them: For which <HI>Blifil</HI> making many Profe&s;&s;ions of his Unworthine&s;s, poured forth a Pro|fu&s;ion of Thanks: And then he having declared he would immediately depart to another Lodging, <HI>Jones</HI> returned to his Uncle.</P>
<P>Among other Matters, <HI>Allworthy</HI> now acquainted <HI>Jones</HI> with the Di&s;covery which he made concerning the 500 <HI>l.</HI> Bank-Notes. <Q REND="inline">'&punc;I have,' &s;aid he, 'already con&s;ulted a Lawyer, who tells me, to my great A&s;to|ni&s;hment, that there is no Puni&s;hment for a Fraud of this Kind.

<P><Q REND="inline">'Good Heaven!' &s;ays <HI>Jones,</HI> 'is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;I am &s;hocked beyond Mea&s;ure at this News.

Indeed, my dear Uncle, you mu&s;t &s;uffer me to call it Weak|ne&s;s rather than Ingratitude; for I am convinced the poor Fellow loves me, and hath done me &s;ome Kindne&s;s, which I can never forget; nay, I believe he hath repented of this very Act: For it is not above a Day or two ago, when my Affairs &s;eemed in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Situation, that he vi&s;ited me in my Confinement, and offered me any Money I wanted.
<PB N="349" REF="354">
Con&s;ider, Sir, what a Temptation to a Man who had ta&s;ted &s;uch bitter Di&s;tre&s;s, it mu&s;t be to have a Sum in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t put him and his Family beyond any future Po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uffering the like.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">'Child,' cries <HI>Allworthy,</HI> 'you carry this forgiv|ing Temper too far. Such mi&s;taken Mercy is not only weakne&s;s, but borders on Inju&s;tice, and is ve|ry pernicious to Society, as it encourages Vice. The Di&s;hone&s;ty of this Fellow I might perhaps have pardoned, but never his Ingratitude. And give me Leave to &s;ay, when we &s;uffer any Temptation to atone for Di&s;hone&s;ty it&s;elf, we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be; and &s;o far I confe&s;s I have gone: for I have often pitied the Fate of a Highwayman, when I have been on the Grand Jury; and have more than once applied to the Judge on the Behalf of &s;uch as have had any mitigating Cir|cum&s;tances in their Ca&s;e; but when Di&s;hone&s;ty is attended with any blacker Crime, &s;uch as Cruelty, Murder, Ingratitude, or the like, Compa&s;&s;ion and Forgivene&s;s then become Faults. I am convinced the Fellow is a Villain, and he &s;hall be puni&s;hed; at lea&s;t as far as I can puni&s;h him.'</Q></P>
<P>This was &s;poke with &s;o &s;tern a Voice, that <HI>Jones</HI> did not think proper to make any Reply: Be&s;ides, the Hour appointed by Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> now drew &s;o near that he had barely Time left do dre&s;s him&s;elf. Here therefore ended the pre&s;ent Dialogue, and <HI>Jones</HI> re|tired to another Room, where <HI>Partridge</HI> attended, according to order, with his Cloaths.</P>
<P><HI>Partridge</HI> had &s;carce &s;een his Ma&s;ter &s;ince the hap|py Di&s;covery. The poor Fellow was unable either to contain or expre&s;s his Tran&s;ports.

His Memory, however, was not in the lea&s;t defi|cient.

<P><HI>JONES</HI> being now completely dre&s;&s;ed, attended his Uncle to Mr. <HI>We&s;tern'</HI>s.

<HEAD>CHAP. <HI>The la&s;t In which the Hi&s;tory is concluded.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOUNG <HI>Nightingale</HI> had been that Afternoon by Appointment to wait on his Father who received him much more kindly than he expected. There likewi&s;e he met his Uncle, who was returned to Town in que&s;t of his new married Daughter.</P>
<P>This Marriage was the luckie&s;t Incident which could have happened to the young Gentleman; for the&s;e Brothers lived in a con&s;tant Contention about the Go|verment of their Children, both heartily de&s;pi&s;ing the Method which each other took. Each of them therefore now endeavoured as much as he could to palliate the Offence which his own Child had com|mitted, and to aggravate the Match of the other. This De&s;ire of triumphing over his Brother, added to the many Arguments which <HI>Allworthy</HI> had u&s;ed, &s;o &s;trongly operated on the old Gentleman, that he met his Son with a &s;miling Countenance, and actually
<PB N="359" REF="364">
agreed to &s;up with him that Evening at Mrs. <HI>Mil|ler'</HI>s.</P>
<P>As for the other, who really loved his Daughter with the mo&s;t immoderate Affection, there was little Difficulty in inclining him to a Reconciliation. He was no &s;ooner informed by his Nephew where his Daughter and her Hu&s;band were, than he declared he would in&s;tantly go to her. And when he arrived there, he &s;carce &s;uffered her to fall upon her Knees, before he took her up, and embraced her with a Tenderne&s;s which affected all who &s;aw him; and in le&s;s than a Quarter of an Hour was as well re|conciled to both her and her Hu&s;band, as if he had him&s;elf joined their Hands.</P>
<P>In this Situation were Affairs when Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> and his Company arrived to complete the Happine&s;s of Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> who no &s;ooner &s;aw <HI>Sophia,</HI> than &s;he gue&s;&s;ed every Thing that had happened; and &s;o great was her Friend&s;hip to <HI>Jones,</HI> that it added not a few Tran&s;ports to tho&s;e &s;he felt on the Happine&s;s of her own Daughter.</P>
<P>There have not, I believe, been many In&s;tances of a number of People met together, where every one was &s;o perfectly happy, as in this Company. Among&s;t whom the Father of young <HI>Nightingale</HI> enjoyed the lea&s;t perfect Content; for notwith&s;tanding his Affecti|on for his Son, notwith&s;tanding the Authority and the Arguments of <HI>Allworthy,</HI> together with the other Motive mentiond before, he could not &s;o entirely be &s;atisfied with his Son's Choice; and perhaps the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Sophia</HI> her&s;elf tended a little to aggravate and heighten his Concern, as a Thought now and then &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, that his Son might have had that Lady, or &s;ome &s;uch other. Not that any of the Charms which adorned either the Per&s;on or Mind of <HI>Sophia,</HI> created the Unea&s;ine&s;s: It was the Contents of her Father's Coffers which &s;et his Heart a longing.
<PB N="360" REF="365">
The&s;e were the Charms which he could not bear to think his Son had &s;acrificed to the Daughter of Mrs. <HI>Miller.</HI></P>
<P>The Brides were both very pretty Women; but &s;o totally were they eclip&s;ed by the Beauty of <HI>Sophia,</HI> that had they not been two of the be&s;t-tempered Girls in the World, it would have rai&s;ed &s;ome Envy in their Brea&s;ts; for neither of their Hu&s;bands could long keep his Eyes from <HI>Sophia,</HI> who &s;at at the Table like a Queen receiving Homage, or rather like a &s;uperior Being receiving Adoration from all around her. But it was an Adoration which they gave, not which &s;he ex|acted: For &s;he was as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by her Mo|de&s;ty and Affability, as by all her other Perfections.</P>
<P>The Evening was &s;pent in much true Mirth. All were happy, but tho&s;e the mo&s;t, who had been mo&s;t unhappy before. Their former Sufferings and Fears gave &s;uch a Reli&s;h to their Felicity, as even Love and Fortune in their fulle&s;t Flow could not have given with|out the Advantage of &s;uch a Compari&s;on. Yet as great Joy, e&s;pecially after a &s;udden Change and Re|volution of Circum&s;tances, is apt to be &s;ilent, and dwells rather in the Heart than on the Tongue, <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia</HI> appeared the lea&s;t merry of the whole Company. Which <HI>We&s;tern</HI> ob&s;erved with great Im|patience often crying out to them, <Q REND="inline">'Why do'&s;t not talk Boy! Why do'&s;t look &s;o grave! Ha&s;t lo&s;t thy Tongue Girl! Drink another Gla&s;s of Wine, &s;ha't drink another Gla&s;s?</Q> And the more to enliven her, he would &s;ometimes &s;ing a merry Song, which bore &s;ome Relation to Matrimony, and the Lo&s;s of a Maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded &s;o far on that Topic, as to have driven her out of the Room, if Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> had not checkt him &s;ometimes by Looks, and once or twice by a <HI>Fie! Mr. We&s;tern.</HI> He began indeed once to debate the Matter, and a&s;|&s;ert his Right to talk to his own Daughter as he thought
<PB N="361" REF="366">
fit: but as no Body &s;econded him, he was &s;oon re|duced to Order.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this little Re&s;traint, he was &s;o plea&s;ed with the Chearfulne&s;s and Good-Humour of the Company, that he in&s;i&s;ted on their meeting the next Day at his Lodgings. They all did &s;o; and the lovely <HI>Sophia,</HI> who was now in private become a Bride too, officiated as the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ceremo|nies, or, in the polite Phra&s;e, did the Honours of the Table. She had that Morning given her Hand to <HI>Jones,</HI> in the Chapel at <HI>Doctors-Commons,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> Mr. <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> were the only Per&s;ons pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> had earne&s;tly de&s;ired her Father, that no o|thers of the Company, who were that Day to dine with him, &s;hould be acquainted with her Marriage. The &s;ame Secrecy was enjoined to Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> undertook for <HI>Allworthy.</HI> This &s;ome what re|conciled the Delicacy of <HI>Sophia</HI> to the public Enter|tainment, which, in Compliance with her Father's Will, &s;he was obliged to go to, greatly again&s;t her own Inclinations. In Confidence of this Secrecy, &s;he went through the Day pretty well, till the Squire, who was now advanced into the &s;econd Bottle, could contain his Joy no longer, but, filling out a Bum|per, drank a Health to the Bride. The Health was immediately pledged by all pre&s;ent, to the great Con|fu&s;ion of poor blu&s;hing <HI>Sophia,</HI> and the great Concern of <HI>Jones</HI> upon her Account. To &s;ay Truth, there was not a Per&s;on pre&s;ent made wi&s;er by this Di&s;cove|ry; for Mrs. <HI>Miller</HI> had whi&s;pered it to her Daugh|ter, her Daughter to her Hu&s;band, her Hu&s;band to his Si&s;ter, and &s;he to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> now took the fir&s;t Opportunity of withdraing with the Ladies, and the Squire &s;at in to his Cups, in which he was, by Degrees, de&s;erted by all the Company, except the Uncle of young <HI>Nightingale,</HI> who loved his Bottle as well as <HI>We&s;tern</HI> him&s;elf.
<PB N="362" REF="367">
The&s;e two therefore &s;at &s;toutly to it, during the whole Evening, and long after that happy Hour which had &s;urrendered the charming <HI>Sophia</HI> to the eager Arms of her enraptured <HI>Jones.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, Reader, we have at length brought our Hi|&s;tory to a Conclu&s;ion, in which, to our great Plea|&s;ure, tho' contrary perhaps to thy Expectation, Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> appears to be the happie&s;t of all human Kind: For what Happine&s;s this World affords equal to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a Woman as <HI>Sophia,</HI> I &s;incerely own I have never yet di&s;covered.</P>
<P>As to the other Per&s;ons who have made any con&s;i|derable Figure in this Hi&s;tory, as &s;ome may de&s;ire to know a little more concerning them, we will proceed in as few Words as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;atisfy their Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> hath never yet been prevailed upon to &s;ee <HI>Blifil,</HI> but he hath yielded to the Importunity of <HI>Jones,</HI> backed by <HI>Sophia,</HI> to &s;ettle 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year up|on him; to which <HI>Jones</HI> hath privately added a third. Upon this Income he lives in one of the northern Counties, about 200 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>London,</HI> and lays up 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year out of it, in order to purcha&s;e a Seat in the next Parliament from a neighbouring Borough, which he has bargained for with an Attor|ney there. He is al&s;o lately turned Methodi&s;t, in hopes of marrying a very rich Widow of that Sect, who&s;e E&s;tate lies in that Part of the Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Square</HI> died &s;oon after he writ the before mention|ed Letter; and as to <HI>Thwackum,</HI> he continues at his Vicarage. He hath made many fruitle&s;s Attempts to regain the Confidence of <HI>Allworthy,</HI> or to ingratiate him&s;elf with <HI>Jones,</HI> both of whom he flatters to their Faces, and abu&s;es behind their Backs. But in his &s;tead, Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> hath lately taken Mr. <HI>Abraham Adams</HI> into his Hou&s;e, of whom <HI>Sophia</HI> is grown immoderately fond, and declares he &s;hall have the Tuition of her Children.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="368">
Mrs. <HI>Fitzpatrick</HI> is &s;eparated from her Hu&s;band, and retains the little Remains of her Fortune. She lives in Reputation at the polite End of the Town, and is &s;o good an Oeconomi&s;t, that &s;he &s;pends three Times the Income of her Fortune, without running in Debt. She maintains a perfect Intimacy with the Lady of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Peer; and in Acts of Friend&s;hip to her repays all the Obligations &s;he owes to her Hus|band.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> was &s;oon reconciled to her Niece <HI>So|phia,</HI> and hath &s;pent two Months together with her in the Country. Lady <HI>Bella&s;ton</HI> made the latter a formal Vi&s;it at her Return to Town, where &s;he be|haved to <HI>Jones,</HI> as to a perfect Stranger, and with great Civility, wi&s;hed him Joy on his Marriage.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nightingale</HI> hath purcha&s;ed an E&s;tate for his Son in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Jones,</HI> where the young Gentleman, his Lady, Mrs. <HI>Miller,</HI> and her little Daughter re&s;ide, and the mo&s;t agreeable Intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the two Families.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e of lower Account, Mrs. <HI>Waters</HI> re|turned into the Country, had a Pen&s;ion of 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year &s;ettled upon her by Mr. <HI>Allworthy,</HI> and is mar|ried to Par&s;on <HI>Supple,</HI> on whom, at the In&s;tance of <HI>Sophia, We&s;tern</HI> hath be&s;towed a con&s;iderable Living.</P>
<P><HI>Black George</HI> hearing the Di&s;covery that had been made, run away, and was never &s;ince heard of; and <HI>Jones</HI> be&s;towed the Money on his Family, but not in equal Proportions, for <HI>Molly</HI> had much the greate&s;t Share.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Partridge, Jones</HI> hath &s;ettled 50 <HI>l.</HI> a Year on him; and he hath again &s;et up a School, in which he meets with much better Encouragement than for|merly; and there is now a Treaty of Marriage on Foot, between him and Mi&s;s <HI>Molly Seagrim,</HI> which through the Mediation of <HI>Sophia,</HI> is likely to take Effect.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="369">
We now return to take Leave of Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Sophia,</HI> who, within two Days after their Marriage, attended Mr. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and Mr. <HI>Allworthy</HI> into the Country. <HI>We&s;tern</HI> hath re&s;igned his Family Seat, and the greater Part of his E&s;tate to his Son-in-law, and hath retired to a le&s;&s;er Hou&s;e of his, in another Part of the Country, which is better for Hunting. Indeed he is often as a Vi&s;itant with Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> who as well as his Daughter, hath an infinite Delight in doing every Thing in their Power to plea&s;e him. And this De&s;ire of theirs is attended with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that the old Gentleman declares he was never happy in his Life till now. He hath here a Parlour and Anti|chamber to him&s;elf, where he gets drunk with whom he plea&s;es, and his Daughter is &s;till as ready as for|merly to play to him whenever he de&s;ires it; for <HI>Jones</HI> hath a&s;&s;ured her, that as next to plea&s;ing her, one of his highe&s;t Satisfactions is to contribute to the Happine&s;s of the old Man; &s;o the great Duty which &s;he expre&s;&s;es and performs to her Father renders her almo&s;t equally dear to him, with the Love which &s;he be&s;tows on him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> hath already produced him two fine Chil|dren, a Boy and a Girl, of whom the old Gentleman is &s;o fond, that he &s;pends much of his Time in the Nur&s;ery, where he declares the tattling of his little Grand-Daughter, who is above a Year and half old, is &s;weeter Mu&s;ic than the fine&s;t Cry of Dogs in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Allworthy</HI> was likewi&s;e greatly liberal to <HI>Jones</HI> on the Marriage, and hath omitted no In&s;tance of &s;hew|ing his Affection to him and his Lady, who love him as a Father. Whatever in the Nature of <HI>Jones</HI> had a Tendency to Vice, has been corrected by continual Conver&s;ation with this good Man, and by his Union with the lovely and virtuous <HI>Sophia.</HI> He has al&s;o, by Reflexion on his pa&s;t Follies, acquired a Di&s;cretion
<PB N="365" REF="370">
and Prudence very uncommon in one of his lively Parts.</P>
<P>To conclude, as there are not to be found a wor|thier Man and Woman, than this fond Couple, &s;o neither can any be imagined more happy. They pre|&s;erve the pure&s;t and tendere&s;t Affection for each other, an Affection daily encrea&s;ed and confirmed by mutual E&s;teem. Nor is their Conduct towards their Relati|ons and Friends le&s;s amiable, than towards one ano|ther. And &s;uch is their Conde&s;cen&s;ion, their Indul|gence, and their Beneficence to tho&s;e below them, that there is not a Neighbour, a Tenant, or a Ser|vant, who doth not mo&s;t gratefully ble&s;s the Day when Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> was married to <HI>Sophia.</HI></P>
