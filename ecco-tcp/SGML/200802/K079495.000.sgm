<L>IN vain, dear Monitor, thy kind de&s;ire</L>
<L>To wake the embers of poetic fire!</L>
<L>To clear the mind, where Grief's dark &s;hadows lower,</L>
<L>And Fancy dies by Sorrow's freezing power!</L>
<L N="5">In vain would Friend&s;hip's chearing voice &s;ugge&s;t</L>
<L>Her flattering vi&s;ions to the Poet's brea&s;t;</L>
<L>That public favor calls, with ju&s;t demand,</L>
<L>Th' expected volume from his lingering hand:</L>
<L>Lo&s;t are tho&s;e anxious hopes, that eager pride,</L>
<L N="10">With thee, my THORNTON, they declin'd, they died.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="4">
Friend of my opening &s;oul! who&s;e love began</L>
<L>To hail thy Poet, ere he rank'd as man!</L>
<L>Who&s;e prai&s;e, like dew-drops, which the early morn</L>
<L>Sheds with mild virtue on the vernal thorn,</L>
<L N="15">Taught his young mind each &s;well of thought to &s;hew,</L>
<L>And gave the germs of fancy &s;trength to blow!</L>
<L>Dear, firm a&s;&s;ociate of his &s;tudious hour,</L>
<L>Who led his idler &s;tep to Learning's bower!</L>
<L>Tho' young, imparting to his giddier youth</L>
<L N="20">Thy thir&s;t of &s;cience, and thy zeal for truth!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye towers of Granta, where our friend&s;hip grew,</L>
<L>And that pure mind expanded to my view,</L>
<L>Our love fraternal let thy walls atte&s;t,</L>
<L>Where Attic joys our letter'd evening ble&s;t;</L>
<L N="25">Where midnight, from the chains of &s;leep reliev'd,</L>
<L>Stole on our &s;ocial &s;tudies unperceiv'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<L>But not, my THORNTON! in that calm alone</L>
<L>Was thy mild genius, thy warm virtue known:</L>
<L>When manhood mark'd the hour for bu&s;y &s;trife,</L>
<L N="30">And led us to the crowded maze of life,</L>
<L>From whence to &s;weet retirement's &s;oothing &s;hade,</L>
<L>Love and the Mu&s;e thy willing friend convey'd;</L>
<L>Thy &s;oul, more firm to join the &s;truggling crowd,</L>
<L>To nobler Themis toil&s;ome homage vow'd,</L>
<L N="35">With zeal, devoting to her &s;acred throne</L>
<L>A heart as uncorrupted as her own.</L>
<L>Still as thy mind, with manly powers endued,</L>
<L>The opening path of active life pur&s;ued,</L>
<L>And round the ripening field of bu&s;ine&s;s rang'd,</L>
<L N="40">Thy heart, unwarp'd, unharden'd, une&s;trang'd,</L>
<L>To early friend&s;hip &s;till retain'd its truth,</L>
<L>With all the warm integrity of youth.</L>

<PB N="8" REF="6">
<L>Whene'er affliction's force thy friend oppre&s;t,</L>
<L>Thou wer't the rock on which his cares might re&s;t;</L>
<L N="45">From thy kind words his ri&s;ing hopes would own</L>
<L>The charm of rea&s;on in affection's tone.</L>
<L>Where is the &s;oothing voice of equal power,</L>
<L>To take it's angui&s;h from the pre&s;ent hour?</L>
<L>Beneath the pre&s;&s;ure of a grief &s;o ju&s;t,</L>
<L N="50">The lenient aid of books in vain I tru&s;t:</L>
<L>They, that could once the war of thought controul,</L>
<L>And bani&s;h di&s;cord from the jarring &s;oul,</L>
<L>Now irritate the mind, they u&s;ed to heal,</L>
<L>They &s;peak too loudly of the lo&s;s I feel.</L>

<L N="55">Thou faithful cen&s;or of the Poet's &s;train,</L>
<L>No more &s;halt thou his &s;inking hope &s;u&s;tain,</L>
<L>No more, with ardent zeal's enlivening fire,</L>
<L>Call from inglorious &s;hades his &s;ilent lyre:</L>

No more, as in our days of plea&s;ure pa&s;t,</L>
<L N="60">The eye of judgment o'er his labors ca&s;t;</L>
<L>Keen to di&s;cern the blemi&s;hes, that lurk</L>
<L>In the loo&s;e texture of his growing work;</L>
<L>Eager to prai&s;e, yet re&s;olute to blame,</L>
<L>Kind to his ver&s;e, but kinder to his fame.</L>

<L N="65">How may the Mu&s;e, who pro&s;per'd by thy care,</L>
<L>Now meet the public eye without de&s;pair?</L>
<L>Now, if har&s;h cen&s;ures on her failings pour,</L>
<L>Her warme&s;t advocate can &s;peak no more:</L>

<L N="70">If &s;pleen's proud cavil &s;train'd her tortur'd &s;en&s;e;</L>
<L>Which bade her &s;ong to public prai&s;e a&s;pire,</L>

<L>Find in &s;ome lighter lay a vain relief,</L>

Still mu&s;t &s;he deem &s;uch ver&s;e, if &s;uch could be,</L>
<L>A wound to friend&s;hip, and a crime to thee;</L>
<L>Profanely utter'd at this &s;acred time,</L>
<L>When thy pale cor&s;e demands her plaintive rhime,</L>
<L>And Virtue, weeping whom &s;he could not &s;ave,</L>

<L>Hail hallow'd vault! who&s;e dark&s;ome caverns hold</L>
<L>A frame, though mortal, of no common mould;</L>
<L>A heart &s;carce &s;ullied with a human flaw,</L>
<L>Which &s;hun'd no duty, and tran&s;gre&s;s'd no law;</L>
<L N="85">In joy &s;till guarded, in di&s;tre&s;s &s;erene,</L>
<L>Thro' life a model of the golden mean,</L>
<L>Which friend&s;hip only led him to tran&s;gre&s;s,</L>

Nor wi&s;h'd that friend&s;hip &s;hould on marble give</L>

<L>On the clo&s;e tablet of her faithful brea&s;t.</L>

<L N="110">To paint thy mind in truth's unfading dyes,</L>
