<P>THe&s;e Words contain the Sub&s;tance of the Apo&s;tle's de&s;ign both in this Chapter, and in his more copious Di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ame Subject in the 12th and 14th Chapters of his Fir&s;t Epi|&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> In which places he

gives us an Account of the <HI>Government</HI> in&s;ti|tuted in the Church of Chri&s;t; the diver&s;ity of its <HI>Officers,</HI> and their <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Powers;</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> of the In&s;titution, and the Spring of their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion;</HI> together with the great <HI>End</HI> and Purpo&s;e for which this wi&s;e Admi|ni&s;tration was contriv'd and e&s;tabli&s;hed: Things of the highe&s;t Importance, and very pertinent to the pre&s;ent <HI>Occa&s;ion:</HI> And there|fore I &s;hall, as far as the time allotted for my Di&s;cour&s;e will permit, take notice of the&s;e &s;everal things, under the &s;everal Parts of my Text, and then conclude with &s;uch <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> as naturally flow from this Doctrine.<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Here is an Account of the &s;everal Or|ders entru&s;ted with the Government of the Church. <HI>Some Apo&s;tles, and &s;ome Prophets, and &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome Pa&s;tors and Teachers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Apo&s;tle here tells us who was the Author of this E&s;tabli&s;hment. <HI>He gave,</HI> even our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, who <HI>de&s;cended into</HI> the Grave, <HI>the lower parts of the Earth,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
and then <HI>a&s;cended far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.</HI> v. 9, 10.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. We are here In&s;tructed in the End and De&s;ign of this Di&s;pen&s;ation; And are made acquainted, that all this was done <HI>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini&s;tery, for the Edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. I begin with the fir&s;t, <HI>The &s;everal Orders,</HI> &amp;c. where it may be needful (1) to &s;hew that there was a <HI>Di&s;parity</HI> in the&s;e Orders, as to their Office, and a <HI>Subordination</HI> in their Mini&s;tery. (2) To con&s;ider what they were, wherein they differ'd, and what were the pe|culiar <HI>Employments</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> of each Of|fice; and (3) to reflect upon the Goodne&s;s and Providence of God, by which they have all been continued down to the pre&s;ent time, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in this our Church.</P>
<P N="1">1. That there was a <HI>Subordination</HI> in the Office of the &s;everal Orders in the Chri&s;tian Church. Now this appears from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> and <HI>Allu&s;ions,</HI> both here, and in the other Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> At the 4th Ver&s;e of this Chapter he tells the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
that the Church of Chri&s;t is <HI>one Body,</HI> that <HI>there is one Spirit, one Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m, and one God and Father of all;</HI> and yet he adds at the 7th ver&s;e, <HI>But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the mea&s;ure of the gift of Chri&s;t.</HI> i. e. agreeably to the true meaning of the Original word <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in this and other places, to every one of us is given his <HI>Office</HI> or employment in the Church, different ac|cording to the different gifts, which it has plea&s;ed our Lord to be&s;tow upon us.</P>
<P>And this he exemplifies in the following Ver&s;e, by repre&s;enting our Saviour di&s;tribu|ting the&s;e Gifts, as <HI>Conquerors</HI> u&s;ed to do, when they made triumphal Entries into their Capital Cities, after &s;ome notable Victories over their Enemies; when we know it was u&s;ual to di&s;per&s;e among the People <HI>Medals</HI> of different Bigne&s;s and different Metal, and other <HI>Gifts,</HI> &s;ome of greater and &s;ome of le&s;&s;er price. Thus our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> when he had conquered Satan and Sin, and Hell and Death, and made his Triumphant Entry into Heaven, di&s;tributed the different Gifts of his holy Spirit, in &s;uch <HI>kinds</HI> and &s;uch <HI>proportions</HI> as the Per&s;ons and Offices required to which
<PB N="5" REF="6">
they were conveyed. v. 8. <HI>Wherefore he &s;aith when he a&s;cended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Apo|&s;tles,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Prophets,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t the <HI>Subordination</HI> of the different Orders &s;hould not &s;ufficiently appear from this <HI>di&s;parity</HI> of their Gifts, our Apo&s;tle ren|ders it yet more evident 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. by com|paring them to the &s;everal parts of the Body of man; where he not only tells us at the 4. v. &amp;c. that <HI>there are diver&s;ities of Gifts, dif|ferences of Admini&s;trations</HI> and <HI>diver&s;ities of Operations;</HI> but that the&s;e have a <HI>relation</HI> to, and a <HI>dependance</HI> upon one another, as the <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Hands,</HI> and <HI>Feet</HI> have in mans Bo|dy, v. 12. <HI>For as the Body is one and hath many Members, and all the Members of that one Bo|dy, being many, are one Body, &s;o al&s;o is Chri&s;t,</HI> that is, in his Body the Church. Now we know in our Bodies, the <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet,</HI> &amp;c. are not only <HI>different,</HI> but <HI>&s;ubordinate;</HI> the Feet mu&s;t walk by the di|rection of the <HI>Eye</HI> and the Hands act at the command of the <HI>Head,</HI> otherwi&s;e the Acti|ons will be <HI>di&s;orderly,</HI> and the whole Body mu&s;t &s;uffer. And if there be not the like
<PB N="6" REF="7">
regard in the Inferior Officers in the Church toward the Superior; but all affect to di|rect them &s;elves, and to be the Head; there can be nothing el&s;e but <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> in it, for <HI>if all will be one Member, where then is the Body?</HI> v. 19.</P>
<P>I &s;hall crave leave only to add to this Head, that this &s;ubordination of Mini&s;ters in the Church of Chri&s;t, is agreeable to what was practis'd both under the Law of <HI>Nature,</HI> and that of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> I need not take notice of the <HI>Heathen</HI> World, who were left to bare <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in this matter; among whom we every where find a <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> of dignity in the Orders of their Prie&s;ts; the thing being evi|dent among the Wor&s;hippers of the <HI>True</HI> God, who were not without &s;ome light of <HI>Revelation</HI> even under the Law of Nature, long before the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation; <HI>Abra|ham</HI> him&s;elf paid Tithes to <HI>Melchizedec,</HI> and was ble&s;&s;ed by him, and <HI>without all contra|diction the Le&s;s is ble&s;&s;ed of the Greater,</HI> as the Author to the <HI>Heb.</HI> argues c. 7. v. 7. The <HI>Prie&s;thood</HI> was a natural right of <HI>Primogeni|ture</HI> at fir&s;t, and God by a particular Com|mand order'd the <HI>Fir&s;t-Born</HI> to be Sancti|fied
<PB N="7" REF="8">
to his Service; and 'tis no que&s;tion but the&s;e are the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> which we read of before the giving of the Law. <HI>Exodus,</HI> 19. 21, 22. <HI>The Lord &s;aid unto</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>go down, charge the People lea&s;t they break through unto the Lord, to gaze and many of them peri&s;h; and let the Prie&s;ts al&s;o which come near to the Lord, Sancti|fy them&s;elves, lea&s;t the Lord break forth among them.</HI> And yet the&s;e fir&s;t Born, thus honour'd with the Prie&s;thood, were &s;ubject to the <HI>Heads</HI> of their <HI>Families,</HI> and commanded by them. Thus <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and under him the Twelve Heads of <HI>Tribes,</HI> and the Seventy Fathers of <HI>Families,</HI> governed the Church, till it plea&s;ed God to take to him&s;elf the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Fir&s;t-Born;</HI> and then the <HI>High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Levites</HI> mi|ni&s;ter'd in the Service of God, in an undeni|able <HI>Subordination.</HI> From all which I think it is very plain, that a <HI>Co-ordinate</HI> mini&s;tery, or a <HI>Parity</HI> among all &s;uch as are employed about holy things, is a Scheme that never was found in any <HI>Nation,</HI> or <HI>Age</HI> of the World; it was never either Commanded of God, or Invented by Men, till the confu&s;i|ons of <HI>Late</HI> times brought it forth, and
<PB N="8" REF="9">
let the <HI>Enemies</HI> of our Church have the honour of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Subordination of the&s;e Offices be|ing E&s;tabli&s;h'd, we are now to con&s;ider what they were, wherein they differ'd, and what were the peculiar Employments and Powers of each Office. Now in order to find out this, we mu&s;t compare the <HI>Catalogue</HI> of them in this place, with the other in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 28. Here it is, <HI>he gave &s;ome Apo&s;tles, and &s;ome Prophets, and &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome Pa&s;tors and Teachers.</HI> There it is thus, <HI>God hath &s;et &s;ome in the Church, fir&s;t Apo&s;tles, &s;econ|darily Prophets, thirdly Teachers;</HI> after which no more <HI>Orders</HI> are named, but only tho&s;e <HI>Powers</HI> that attended them in their work; <HI>Mi|racles, Gifts of Healing,</HI> &amp;c. and at v. 29. the Apo&s;tle asks, <HI>Are all Apo&s;tles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</HI> and without enquiring after more <HI>Orders,</HI> asks only of the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch <HI>Powers</HI> as are before mentioned. <HI>Are all workers of Miracles? Have all the gift of Healing? Do all &s;peak with Tongues? Do all Interpret?</HI> Whence it &s;eems very rea&s;onable to infer, that <HI>Apo&s;tles, Prophets and Evange|li&s;ts</HI> in the one place, mu&s;t be the &s;ame with
<PB N="9" REF="10">
<HI>Apo&s;tles, Prophets and Teachers</HI> in the other, and that <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers</HI> which are ad|ded over and above in my <HI>Text,</HI> mu&s;t not be different <HI>Officers</HI> from tho&s;e before named, but other <HI>Words</HI> for the &s;ame Officers, rela|ting to the different manner of receiving their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> or the different parts of their Employments. And therefore it is the Judgment of very Learned men that <HI>Prophets and Evangeli&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prophets and Teachers</HI> are the very &s;ame Mini&s;ters, with <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers,</HI> with this only difference, that the <HI>former</HI> were &s;uch as out of the <HI>Fir&s;t-Fruits</HI> of the Believers were &s;et apart and con&s;ecrated to their Office by the <HI>Manife&s;tation of the Spirit,</HI> or by a Supernatural effu&s;ion of Gifts proper to their Employments. The <HI>latter</HI> were &s;uch as were Ordained and Con&s;titu|ted by <HI>Impo&s;ition of Hands,</HI> as &s;tated Gover|nours of the Churches allotted to their Charge. However this be, it is plain that <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> in the one place are called <HI>Teach|ers</HI> in the other, from their <HI>Teaching</HI> and In|&s;tructing their Converts, and it &s;eems as rea|&s;onable that Chri&s;tian <HI>Prophets</HI> may be called <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> from their <HI>Feeding</HI> and Governing their Flocks; &s;o that whether the&s;e are dif|ferent
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Names for the very &s;ame <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> or whether they &s;ignify the &s;ame <HI>Office,</HI> but with this difference, that the one re&s;pects it, as gi|ven immediately by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and the other by the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> the re&s;ult will be the &s;ame; that there are only <HI>Three</HI> Orders properly here in|tended, and that it is of their Office and Em|ployments that we are to enquire.</P>
<P>And I the rather encline to this Conclu&s;i|on, becau&s;e it is agreeable to the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Prediction</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI> him&s;elf, while he was upon Earth. <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 34. <HI>Behold I &s;end to you Prophets, and Wi&s;e men, and Scribes, and &s;ome of them you &s;hall kill and crucify,</HI> &amp;c. Where there are only the&s;e Three Orders promis'd; the <HI>Second</HI> of which though here fir&s;t placed, are called by the &s;ame name as in the <HI>Text, Prophets.</HI> The <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> are called <HI>Wi&s;e men,</HI> agreeably to their di&s;tingui&s;hing Gift, which we &s;hall &s;ee by and by was the <HI>Word of Wi&s;dom;</HI> and therefore St. <HI>Luke,</HI> who was St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Evangeli&s;t, calls them by the &s;ame Name which St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf gives them, that of <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> c. 11. v. 49. <HI>Therefore al&s;o &s;aid the Wi&s;dom of God, I will &s;end them Prophets</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<HI>and Apo&s;tles, and &s;ome of them &s;hall they Slay and Per&s;ecute,</HI> &amp;c. and for the <HI>Third</HI> &s;ort, our Saviour calls them <HI>Scribes</HI> from the nature of their Office; for the Office of the <HI>Scribes</HI> was to Teach the Law, and for this rea&s;on they are in the Go&s;pels frequently call'd by the name of <HI>Doctors</HI> or <HI>Teachers</HI> of the Law. So that <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Teachers</HI> under the Go&s;|pel who&s;e Office was <HI>parallel</HI> to theirs, might very properly bear the &s;ame <HI>Name,</HI> for to <HI>Teach</HI> and <HI>Preach the Go&s;pel; teaching and preaching Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> are the &s;ame things in Scripture. <HI>Luk.</HI> 20. 1. <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 42. Thus our Savi|our built the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Church upon the Model of the <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> and in conde&s;cen&s;ion to that people, and in pur&s;uanee of the <HI>Types</HI> that preceded, was plea&s;ed as it were to Copy their <HI>High-Prie&s;t, Prie&s;ts, and Levites,</HI> in the Orders of the Mini&s;tery, which he e&s;tabli&s;h'd under the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>We are then in the next place to con&s;ider the different <HI>Employments</HI> of the&s;e Three Or|ders, and the different <HI>Powers</HI> that enabled them to di&s;charge the &s;ame. And becau&s;e the Higher always included the Lower, it may not be ami&s;s to begin with the Lowe&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="13">
fir&s;t, and &s;o to a&s;cend to what was peculiar to the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Teachers:</HI> their bu&s;i|ne&s;s was properly to <HI>preach</HI> the Go&s;pel to <HI>&V;nbelievers,</HI> to convince them of its Truth by working <HI>Miracles,</HI> and to <HI>Baptize</HI> them upon their Conver&s;ion. An account of which we have in the 8<HI>th</HI> c. of the <HI>Acts,</HI> where we are taught that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> remaining at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> the re&s;t were <HI>di&s;per&s;ed into</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Samaria <HI>preaching the Word.</HI> And that parti|cularly <HI>Philip,</HI> who was one of the Seven <HI>Deacons,</HI> and is called the <HI>Evangeli&s;t, went down to</HI> Samaria, <HI>and preached Chri&s;t to them.</HI> v. 5. And that notwith&s;tanding the Oppo&s;i|tion of <HI>Simon</HI> the Sorcerer, they <HI>believed</HI> Phi|lip, <HI>preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, beholding the Miracles and Signs which were done, and were Baptized both Men and Women,</HI> v. 12.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Prophets</HI> be&s;ides this, were to <HI>pre|&s;ide</HI> in the A&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>faithful,</HI> to per|form Divine Offices, Admini&s;ter the Lords Supper, and In&s;truct their Flocks in the Scrip|tures, and in the fuller knowledge of the Truths of the Go&s;pel; and of this St. <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
gives us a large Account in the 14. c. o 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> where he exhorts them to de&s;ire the gift of <HI>Prophecy,</HI> rather than that of <HI>Tongues,</HI> &s;hewing, that <HI>Tongues were a Sign to them that believe not, but Prophe&s;ying &s;erveth not for them that believe not, but for them that believe</HI> v. 22. and he oca&s;ionally mentions all the parts of the Chri&s;tian Prophets Office in that Chapter; his <HI>Preaching</HI> v. 3. <HI>He that Prophe|&s;ieth &s;peaketh unto men to Edification, and Ex|hortation and comfort.</HI> His <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Sing|ing</HI> Prai&s;es v. 15. <HI>I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the &V;nder&s;tanding al&s;o: I will Sing with the Spirit, and Sing with the &V;nder&s;tanding al&s;o.</HI> Which <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Singing</HI> are likewi&s;e in the Old Te&s;tament called <HI>Prophe&s;ying.</HI><NOTE N="inter" PLACE="marg">1 Kin. 18. 29. 1 Sam. 10. 5. 1 Chr. 25. 1.</NOTE> And la&s;t of all his Celebrating of the <HI>Euchari&s;t.</HI> v. 16. which is there called <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>giving of Thanks</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> by all which he &s;hews, that the <HI>Prophets</HI> Office was peculiarly directed to the Edification of <HI>Believers,</HI> and for this rea&s;on he tells them v. 4. <HI>He that &s;peaketh in an unknown Tongue edifieth him&s;elf, but he that Prophe&s;ieth edifieth the Church.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="14" REF="15">
3. The <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> be&s;ides all this, had the Su|preme <HI>care of all the Churches</HI> upon them; they were to give <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> for their e&s;tabli&s;hment, to <HI>Confirm</HI> Converts, <HI>Ordain</HI> Church Officers, and <HI>Govern</HI> and <HI>Direct</HI> them when Ordain'd; and by this means to pre&s;erve that <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> which became the Church of Chri&s;t. Thus we find in the forementioned 8th of the <HI>Acts.</HI> v. 14. that <HI>when the Apo&s;tles had heard that</HI> Samaria <HI>had receiv'd the Word of God,</HI> by <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;t, they &s;ent unto them</HI> Pe|ter <HI>and</HI> John, the Apo&s;tles, <HI>who when they were come down, prayed for them that they might rec|eive the Holy Gho&s;t. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them, only they were Baptized in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us; then laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> That is, the Powers and Gifts of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> which fitted them for the &s;everal parts of the <HI>Mini&s;tery:</HI> for &s;o we &s;ee it. <HI>Acts,</HI> 19. 6. when <HI>Paul</HI> hah laid his hands upon tho&s;e Converts at <HI>Ephe&s;us, the Holy Gho&s;t came upon them, and they &s;pake with Tongues and Prophecyed.</HI> i. e. had the Power of <HI>Miracles,</HI> and particularly that of <HI>Tongues</HI> given them to convert <HI>&V;n|believers,</HI> and that of <HI>Prophecy</HI> to direct the
<PB N="15" REF="16">
<HI>Faithful.</HI> And be&s;ides this we find the &s;ame Apo&s;tle c. 14. 21. going over the &s;everal <HI>Churches, Confirming the Souls of the Di&s;ciples, exhorting them to continue in the Faith, ordain|ing them Elders</HI> or Church Officers <HI>in every Church,</HI> and then <HI>commending them to the Lord on whom they believed.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the <HI>Subordination</HI> of <HI>Officers</HI> in the Church of Chri&s;t. And it plea&s;ed our Lord to accommodate his <HI>Gifts</HI> to the Na|ture of their &s;everal Employments, and the&s;e we have likewi&s;e laid down, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 8. &amp;c. <HI>To one is given by the Spirit the word of Wi&s;dom, to another knowledge by the &s;ame Spirit, to ano|ther Faith by the &s;ame Spirit.</HI> Where the Gifts of <HI>Wi&s;dom, Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> An&s;wer to the Three &s;orts of Mini&s;ters. v. 28, 29. <HI>Apo&s;tles, Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3.

<P>III. We mu&s;t therefore ha&s;ten to the Third thing to be con&s;idered, the <HI>end</HI> and de&s;ign of this Di&s;pen&s;ation, in the&s;e Words. <HI>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now here are Three Excellent ends of this Order, to which we mu&s;t briefly give a di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is <HI>The perfecting of the Saints,</HI> Or the Uniting the &s;everal Members of Chri&s;t's Church to <HI>one another,</HI> and to him&s;elf their <HI>Head,</HI> that by the Mini&s;tery of the different Parts his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> might be orderly conveyed to the whole <HI>Body</HI> for its Spiritual improvement and <HI>Perfection;</HI> for &s;o it fol|lows v. 13. <HI>Till we all come in the &V;nity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect Man, unto the mea&s;ure of the Stature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> And this is con&s;onant to what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays upon the &s;ame occa&s;ion, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 25. All this was done, <HI>That there &s;hould be no Schi&s;m in the Body, but that the Members &s;hould have the &s;ame care one of another.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="24">
2. The Second end is <HI>The work of the Mi|ni&s;tery,</HI> that it might be <HI>regular,</HI> and <HI>decent</HI> and <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful</HI> to that great end for which it was Ordained; that all who are employed in it, might be confin'd to their proper <HI>Po&s;ts</HI> and proper <HI>Work,</HI> and not ob&s;truct the pro|gre&s;s of the Go&s;pel by wandring out of their due Ranks and Stations, that the <HI>Feet</HI> might not affect the work or place of the <HI>Hands,</HI> and neither of them that of the <HI>Head;</HI> but that they might remember that 'tis <HI>God</HI> who <HI>hath &s;et the Members every one in the Body, as it has plea&s;ed him,</HI> and that <HI>if they were all one Member, there would be no Body.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 18. 'Tis in pur&s;uance of this, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> c. 14. commands that all things in the Chri&s;tian A&s;|&s;emblies be done <HI>decently and in Order,</HI> and that the Prophets them&s;elves ob&s;erve the Rules pre&s;cribed them, telling them v. 32. that <HI>the Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the Prophets, for God is not the Author of confu&s;ion but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The third end is what follows from the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon the work of the Mini&s;tery, and that is, the <HI>Edifying of the Body of</HI><PB N="24" REF="25">
<HI>of Chri&s;t,</HI> the confirming Believers in a &s;ound <HI>Faith</HI> and a holy <HI>Life;</HI> the former St. <HI>Paul</HI> in&s;tances in at the 14th. v. <HI>That we henceforth be no more Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and car|ried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the &s;light of men, and cunning craftine&s;s whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</HI> And the latter at v. 17. <HI>this I &s;ay therefore and te&s;tifie in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gen|tiles walk in the vanity of their minds.</HI> And he joins both together at v. 15. <HI>but &s;peaking the truth in Love ye may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>Thus have we con&s;ider'd the different <HI>Or|ders</HI> of the Mini&s;tery, the <HI>Author</HI> of the In&s;ti|tution, and the <HI>&V;&s;efulne&s;s</HI> of it to the Church of Chri&s;t, &s;uffer me now to draw two or three Conclu&s;ions from what has been &s;aid, which I &s;hall do very briefly, and &s;o con|clude.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Is the Manife&s;tation of the Spirit <HI>given to every man to profit withall?</HI> Were the&s;e Orders In&s;tituted, not to gratifie the Vanity or Ambition of the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> employ'd, but to &s;erve and feed the <HI>Flock</HI> of Chri&s;t? then all tho&s;e that are call'd to any holy Function
<PB N="25" REF="26">
mu&s;t remember, that they are called to be <HI>Watchful</HI> and <HI>Diligent;</HI> to deny them&s;elves and to guide others; to labour hard, to bear much, and to apply their whole Thoughts to acquit them&s;elves to their great Ma&s;ter, and to carry on the Salvation of tho&s;e Souls which he has <HI>purchas'd with his own Blood.</HI> And whoever &s;hall through <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Sloth</HI> or <HI>unconcern</HI> neglect this work of the Lord, or do it deceitfully, he betrays a Sacred Tru&s;t, abu&s;es his Talents, and will one day receive the bitter Sentence of the unprofita|ble Servant.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Is <HI>God</HI> the Author of this In&s;titution? and is the <HI>Church</HI> edified by the work of its Pa&s;tors? Then are they that <HI>Labour in the Word and Doctrine</HI> entitled to a <HI>double Honor,</HI> both for the dignity of their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the benefit that ari&s;es from their <HI>Service.</HI> And therefore their Per&s;ons ought to be re|&s;pected, their nece&s;&s;ities &s;upplyed, and their endeavours promoted by tho&s;e that are committed to their Charge, and they &s;hould be <HI>e&s;teemed very highly in Love, both for their Ma&s;ter's and their Work's &s;ake.</HI> And if there be any &s;o bold as to de&s;pi&s;e their
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Office, or to contemn or prophane the &s;a|cred Functions in which they &s;erve, he mu&s;t remember that he affronts God that &s;ent them, and injures the Church of Chri&s;t, for who&s;e good they were &s;ent, and mu&s;t here|after be accountable for both, at the Tribu|nal of our Lord.</P>
<P N="3">(3) La&s;tly did our Saviour <HI>In&s;titute,</HI> and has he <HI>pre&s;erv'd</HI> in his Church &s;uch a <HI>Subor|dination</HI> of Mini&s;ters as we have de&s;crib'd, and for &s;uch excellent <HI>Ends;</HI> Men ought then to be very careful of breaking in upon this e&s;tabli&s;hment, both as they tender the honour of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and the good of his <HI>Church.</HI> Sure it mu&s;t be bold to pretend to alter by <HI>Human</HI> Authority, or for rea&s;ons of our own, what was &s;ettled by the Authori|ty of our <HI>Lord,</HI> for rea&s;ons of &s;uch weight, as the <HI>perfecting of the Saints, the work of the Mini&s;try, and the edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t.</HI> Nor can it well be imagin'd that they are true Friends to the <HI>Edification of Chri&s;t's Body</HI> to <HI>purity</HI> of Doctrine, or <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of Life or the <HI>&V;nity</HI> of the Church, who would inno|vate in the&s;e things, and alter that Form of Church Government, which the Wi&s;dom of

Chri&s;t our head, e&s;tabli&s;h'd for this end, for the <HI>Beauty</HI> and order of his Body, and for the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of its Members. May we therefore be truly thankful to God for the pre|&s;ervation of this <HI>primitive</HI> Government. May we be zealous for it's <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Sup|port,</HI> and <HI>Continuance;</HI> and above all may the Per&s;ons employed in it be a <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Ornament</HI> to their Function. May the Piety and Wi&s;dom of our <HI>Fathers,</HI> and the Labours and Order of their <HI>Clergy,</HI> make the Mini&s;try of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> a Pattern for the Governours and Pa&s;tors of all other Churches. And may God give a vi&s;ible Ble&s;&s;ing to their endeavours, in rendring their <HI>Flocks</HI> di&s;cernable from the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian World, in puri|ty of <HI>Faith,</HI> rectitude of <HI>Manners,</HI> and union of <HI>Hearts.</HI> That &s;o Imitating the Apo&s;tolical Churches in Doctrine, Practice and Di&s;cipline, we may be an Exemplary Part of the Church <HI>Militant</HI> in this World, and a Glorious Part of the Church <HI>Trium|phant</HI> in a Future.</P>
