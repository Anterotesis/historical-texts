<P>_THE French were among&s;t the la&s;t nations who made &s;ettle|ments in the We&s;t-Indies; but they made ample amends by the vigour with which they pur|&s;ued them, and by that chain of judicious and admirable mea&s;ures which they u&s;ed in drawing from them every ad|vantage, which the nature of the climate would yield; and in contending again&s;t the difficulties which it threw in their way. The civil wars, which divided and harra&s;&s;ed that kingdom, from the death of Henry the &s;econd, with very little interruption, until the majority of Lewis the fourteenth, withdrew the attention of both prince and people from
<PB N="4" REF="6">
their commercial intere&s;ts to tho&s;e of parties in religion and government. The politicks of the hou&s;e of Valois, though France per|haps was never governed by princes of &s;o in|genious and refined a turn, were wholly of the Machiavillian kind. They tended to di&s;tract, to un&s;ettle, to try dangerous &s;chemes, and to rai&s;e &s;torms only to di&s;play a &s;kill in pilotage. The parties then in France &s;olely contended, what power could be given to or taken from the king, without con|&s;idering what could make their country a great kingdom. Therefore, which way &s;oever the ballance inclined, whether to the king or to the nobles; to the catholicks, or to the prote&s;tants, it was pretty indifferent to the real happine&s;s of that nation. The parties only gamed out of a common &s;tock. Neither could be enriched. But their di&s;&s;entions made all of them poor and weak. The time of cardinal Richlieu mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the true aera of French policy. This great man pacifying all at home, ex|alting the royal authority upon the ruins of the power of the nobility, and modelling that great &s;y&s;tem of general policy in external affairs, which has rai&s;ed France to &s;uch a pitch of greatne&s;s; among&s;t &s;o many, and &s;uch exten&s;ive cares, did not forget tho&s;e of commerce, and what &s;erves mo&s;t effectually to &s;upport commerce, colonies, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ments abroad. But the circum&s;tances of the time, and his genius that embraced &s;o many
<PB N="5" REF="7">
objects, did not leave him lei&s;ure to perfect what he began. It was re&s;erved for that great, wi&s;e, and hone&s;t mini&s;ter Colbert, one of the able&s;t that ever &s;erved any prince, to bring that plan to perfection, to carry it in a great mea&s;ure into execution, and to leave things in &s;uch order, that it was not difficult, when favourable circum&s;tances offered, to make France one of the fir&s;t trading powers in Europe, and her colonies the mo&s;t powerful, their nature con&s;idered, of any in America.</P>
<P>So early as the reign of Francis I. the French attempted an e&s;tabli&s;hment in North-America; but it was not until the year 1625, that they made their fir&s;t &s;ettlement in the We&s;t-Indies. This was upon St. Chri&s;topher, one of the Caribee i&s;lands. A remarkable circum&s;tance attended it; the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land the &s;ame day. But this &s;ettlement had no long life on either &s;ide. The Spaniards had rea&s;on to dread the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of &s;uch powers in their neighbour|hood; and they envied the French and En|gli&s;h tho&s;e advantages it was fore&s;een they would draw from countries from which they had them&s;elves no benefit, and which they claimed only to keep them de&s;arts.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;aulted the&s;e new colonies, and drove them out of the i&s;land. The Engli&s;h colony &s;oon returned, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the large&s;t and be&s;t part, before the French
<PB N="6" REF="8">
could collect them&s;elves; who, finding the Engli&s;h already &s;ettled in the be&s;t part, left a &s;mall colony on the other part. But their chief, and the mo&s;t adventurous of their inha|bitants, went in &s;earch of other &s;eats, when, after various fortune, and after combating the difficulties which a new country and their own imprudence had cau&s;ed them, they made a con&s;iderable &s;ettlement in the i&s;lands of Martinico and Guardaloupe.</P>
<P>Cardinal Richlieu &s;aw very early into the advantages which might ari&s;e from the&s;e &s;ettle|ments, if prudently managed; and he thought the mo&s;t prudent management both for &s;e|curing and extending them, con&s;i&s;ted in but one article; which was, to put the govern|ment into proper hands. With that view he made choice of Mon&s;ieur de Poincy, a knight of Malta; who was &s;ent thither with the title of governor and lieutenant-general of the i&s;les of America, and a very ample commi&s;&s;ion. No per&s;on could be better fitted to rectify the di&s;orders that naturally mu&s;t ari&s;e in every new &s;ettlement, and to put things in a right channel for the time to come. Of a good family; of an unblemi&s;hed reputation for probity; of great reading; of much and various knowledge of life; and of a genius as variou&s;ly exerci&s;ed. He was a ma&s;ter in me|chanical learning; in which he excelled not more to his own honour, than to the benefit
<PB N="7" REF="9">
of the colonies which had the happine&s;s to be committed to his care. He it was that fir&s;t taught them the method of cultivating the &s;ugar cane, and preparing the &s;ugar. He improved the methods which were u&s;ed in the Brazils for this purpo&s;e, both with regard to the mills and the furnaces; and having given a direction to their indu&s;try, he gave it all the encouragement he could, by &s;upport|ing tho&s;e who rai&s;ed their own &s;ub&s;tance, by the means which advanced the colony; whil&s;t he kept a watchful eye, and a &s;evere hand upon all, who were for making ha&s;ty fortunes, without adding to the publick &s;tock. He made admirable regulations for the &s;peedy and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and knowing that all order mu&s;t depend for it's ble&s;&s;ing above, and it's effect here upon an at|tention to religion, he ordered a proper number of churches to be built in all the i&s;lands under his care, and &s;ettled prie&s;ts in them, with a competent, but not a &s;uper|fluous provi&s;ion; but he did not think mona&s;|teries and monks &s;o compatible with a new colony.</P>
<P>Under the in&s;pection of this governor, Martinico, Guardaloupe, part of St. Chri&s;to|pher's, St. Bartholomew, and St. Martin, were &s;ettled, and began to flouri&s;h, and that with very little help from home. A plain proof that almo&s;t every thing depends in
<PB N="8" REF="10">
affairs of this nature, on chu&s;ing proper men to command, and giving them a proper au|thority.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands, however, were unhappily under the &s;uperintendance of an exclu&s;ive company, which, in &s;pite of all that could otherwi&s;e be done, e&s;pecially after the death of Richlieu, &s;o neglected, or mi&s;managed their affairs, that they were obliged to &s;ell a part of the &s;ettlements; and they left the re&s;t hardly worth purcha&s;ing. But the govern|ment at length bought up the i&s;lands which they had alienated, and re&s;cued the others out of their hands. The trade under proper re|gulations was laid open, yet protected under the wings of their great India company. The&s;e regulations took place about 1680, and the benefits of this arrangement were great, and &s;oon apparent. Exclu&s;ive companies may probably be u&s;eful to nouri&s;h an infant trade. They may be u&s;eful too for a very di&s;tant one, where the market is to be nicely managed, and where it is under the dominion of foreign and barbarous princes. But where the trade is between different parts of the dominions of the &s;ame prince, under the protection of his laws, carried on by his own &s;ubjects, and with goods wrought in his own country, &s;uch companies mu&s;t be equally ab&s;urd in their nature, and ruinous in their con&s;equences to the trade.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the Spaniards had ruined the fir&s;t colony at St. Chri&s;topher's, they brought upon them&s;elves by this act, a very heavy revenge for the inju&s;tice of it. Their example at the &s;ame time made it apparent, how much better it is to let a bold and adventurous people &s;ettle in &s;ome place where they can do but little mi&s;chief, and to &s;uffer their &s;pirit to evaporate in peaceful occupa|tions, rather than to keep it up by difficulties, unable to quell it, but which may force it to take another and more dangerous turn.</P>
<P>Several of the French inhabitants, who were expelled from St. Chri&s;topher's, being reduced to great indigence, began to think of de&s;perate cour&s;es. They betook them&s;elves to piracy; and uniting with &s;ome vagrant Engli&s;h, Dutch, and other outca&s;ts of all nations, but re&s;olute fellows, and not de&s;titute of men of capacity among&s;t them, they began a piratical war upon the Spaniards. At fir&s;t they &s;atisfied them&s;elves with taking their &s;hips and de|&s;troying their trade; which they did effectu|ally; but &s;oon encouraged and &s;trengthened by this &s;ucce&s;s, they landed upon the conti|nent of New-Spain and Terra Firma, burning and plundering the open country. Their boldne&s;s and number increa&s;ing with their
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;ucce&s;s, they a&s;&s;aulted and took &s;ome of their &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es and mo&s;t opulent towns. They took Portobello, Campeachy, Maracai|bo, Gibraltar, and the fortre&s;s of Chagra; they even took the city of Panama by &s;torm, and burned it, after defeating an army which came to beat them off. In all which places, and in the others which they had taken, they gained an incredible booty, and committed the mo&s;t unheard of cruelties. Another party of the&s;e pirates pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights of Magel|lan, and entering into the South-Sea, turned the whole coa&s;t of Peru, Chili, and the Ea&s;t of Mexico, into one &s;cene of de&s;olation; every where attended with &s;ucce&s;s, becau&s;e every where acting with a bravery and con|duct, that in any other cau&s;e had merited the highe&s;t honours.</P>
<P>It is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, at fir&s;t view, that all the great things which were done in this new world, were either done by actual pirates, as the&s;e men were, or by private adventurers, but one degree better authorized, and nothing better &s;upported; who&s;e own courage and &s;kill were to be at once their commi&s;&s;ion, their magazines, and their trea&s;ury; being ob|liged to find the re&s;ources of the war, in the war it&s;elf. When the mo&s;t numerous and the be&s;t provided armaments have &s;hamefully failed, and failed in tho&s;e very places, where the adventurers had &s;hewn them &s;uch a
<PB N="11" REF="13">
glorious example of &s;ucce&s;s. But the cau&s;e is not &s;o hard to be a&s;&s;igned. None but men of great enterpri&s;e and bravery, conceive tho&s;e expeditions of them&s;elves. Un&s;upported, but at the &s;ame time unchecked by the higher pow|ers, they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of turning to every &s;ide, and of exerting every faculty. But then they had nothing to hinder this exertion. Their fir&s;t attempts were generally low, and therefore they were pro&s;perous. They did not lead great armies to be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with great difficulty, and to be di&s;couraged and wa&s;ted by the hard&s;hips of the climate; but they habituated them&s;elves to hard&s;hips by de|grees: they were encouraged by &s;maller &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es; and having nothing to expect from their power and numbers, they made amends by their vigilance, their activity, and their courage. The&s;e are cau&s;es adequate to the effect; indeed adequate to any effect, Where|as in the regular way, a general of the fir&s;t note and reputation has rarely been &s;ent into America; the &s;ervice &s;eemed beneath him; and they that were tolerably expert at &s;econd and third parts, (wor&s;e than the ab&s;olutely in|experienced for the very fir&s;t, where the &s;cene is new,) were &s;ent by court favour and in|trigue. What armaments from England, Holland, and France, have been &s;ent in different times to America, who&s;e remains returned without honour or advantage, is
<PB N="12" REF="14">
too clear, and perhaps too invidious a topic to be greatly in&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P>The pirates, whom we called buccaneers improperly, the French denominated flibu&s;|tiers, from the Dutch flyboats, in which they made their fir&s;t expeditions. The buccaneers are no more than per&s;ons who hunt wild cattle in America for their hides and tallow. Some of the&s;e joined the flibu&s;tiers in their fir&s;t expeditions; and from them we named the whole body, buccaneers. The&s;e people brought their prizes and plunder frequently into Jamaica, by which they enriched that i&s;land extremely. Others, finding that the Spaniards were very weak in Hi&s;paniola, and that they had in a manner de&s;erted a con&s;ide|rable part of the i&s;land, made it a place of rendezvous. They who hunted cattle &s;aw the hideous de&s;arts left by the Spani&s;h tyran|ny, a proper place for exerci&s;ing their profe&s;|&s;ion. To the&s;e two &s;orts of people were &s;oon added a third; who were &s;ome of the French in the le&s;&s;er Antilles, who finding how much might be made by &s;upplying a &s;ort of people who expended largely, and were not very exact in their bargains, and perceiving that no part of America afforded a better &s;oil, pa&s;&s;ed over to this i&s;land, and exerci&s;ed here their bu&s;ine&s;s of planters and merchants. The&s;e three &s;orts of people, mutually in want of each other, lived in very good harmony.
<PB N="13" REF="15">
The Spaniards di&s;lodged them &s;everal times; but they &s;till returned, and with new &s;trength; &s;o that it was with difficulty, and after a long di&s;pute, that the Spaniards were able to re|tain one part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The court of France &s;aw the progre&s;s of the&s;e people &s;ilently. Whenever complaints were made, they di&s;avowed their proceedings; re&s;olved not to break mea&s;ures with Spain for the &s;ake of an object, which they were not &s;ure they could hold, and the advantages of which were yet doubtful; but when they found the French in Hi&s;paniola numerous, &s;trong, and wealthy, they owned them as &s;ubjects, &s;ent them a governor and regular forces to keep them &s;o, and to defend them in what they had done: the old method of piracy was &s;till connived at, whil&s;t the trade of &s;kins increa&s;ed, and the plantations extend|ed. At la&s;t the French obtained a legal right by the ce&s;&s;ion, which the Spaniards made them of the North-We&s;t part of the i&s;land by the treaty of Ry&s;wick, in 1697; the be&s;t and mo&s;t fertile part of the be&s;t and mo&s;t fertile i&s;land in the We&s;t-Indies, and perhaps in the world; that which was the fir&s;t &s;ettled, and the whole of which is upwards of four hundred miles long, and one hundred and forty broad. This is the principal &s;ettlement of the French in the We&s;t-Indies, and indeed in all America. The country is mixed;
<PB N="14" REF="16">
pretty mountainous in &s;ome parts, but many of the&s;e mountains are fertile, and covered with beautiful woods. Others, which are bar|ren and rocky, anciently had mines of gold; they are not worked now, though it is judged they not only contain tho&s;e of gold, but mines of &s;ilver, copper, and iron. But the French think, and I believe, with rea&s;on, that their labour is better be&s;towed on the culture of the plains for the&s;e rich commodities, which vend &s;o well in Europe, than in the pur&s;uit of mines, really more precarious in their profits, and which yield a wealth after all, of a le&s;s u&s;eful kind.</P>
<P>This country has likewi&s;e prodigiou&s;ly fine plains, of a va&s;t extent, and extreme fertility; either covered with noble and beautiful fore&s;ts of timber and fruit-trees, excellent in their kinds, or pa&s;tured by va&s;t numbers of horned cattle, &s;heep, and hogs. The air in Hi&s;paniola is of the mo&s;t healthy in the We&s;t-Indies. The country is admirably watered with rivulets as well as navigable rivers. It is no wonder therefore, that this active and indu&s;|trious nation, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o excellent and exten&s;ive a country, has reaped from it pro|digious advantages. They were the better enabled to do this, from the great encourage|ment their &s;ettlements met with in France; and from the wi&s;e regulations which were made concerning them. The&s;e we &s;hall con|&s;ider in their place. But it is certain they
<PB N="15" REF="17">
reckoned in the year 1726, that on this i&s;land they had no le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and negroes, and thirty thou&s;and whites; that they made &s;ixty thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar of five hundred weight each; that the indigo was half as much in value as the &s;ugar; that they exported large quantities of cotton, and that they had &s;ent be&s;ides to France cacao and ginger in tolerable plenty. Since that time they rai&s;e coffee here to a very great amount. Now &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ince that time they have not improved, and that they rai&s;e no more of the&s;e &s;everal commodities than they did in 1726, which is far from the truth, and &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ugar &s;ells but at twenty &s;hillings the hundred, yet at that rate the &s;ixty thou&s;and hog&s;heads mu&s;t yield three hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The indigo is &s;omewhat fallen in its prince &s;ince this calculation was made; but as it certainly has increa&s;ed largely in its quantity, it is not too much to value it at the old rate, at one hundred thou&s;and pound. If to the&s;e we add the produce of the cotton, cacao, ginger, and hides, it will not be too much to allow one hundred thou&s;and more. This is &s;up|po&s;ing things no better than they were in the year 1726, and at this rate her &s;hare of the i&s;land is worth to France five hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year. But if we con&s;ider that they are greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince
<PB N="16" REF="18">
that time, that the &s;ugars are in a higher de|mand; that without le&s;&s;ening any of the old articles, that of coffee is in a manner in|troduced there &s;ince that period, and now makes a great return; it will not be exce&s;&s;ive to rate the value of this colony at &s;even hun|dred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year. It is true, that this part of the French trade &s;uffered greatly in the la&s;t war, and that the progre&s;s of the colony mu&s;t be &s;omewhat re|tarded by it. Yet, allowing all this, Hi&s;|paniola has certainly increa&s;ed at lea&s;t in the mea&s;ure I allow it.</P>
<P>Nations like France and England, full of people of &s;pirit, and of indu&s;try, ea&s;ily recover all the lo&s;&s;es of war. The trade of France was in a deplorable condition at the treaty of Utrecht. She had not then five hundred ve&s;&s;els of all &s;orts in the world. At the beginning of the la&s;t war, but thirty years after, they had eighteen hundred. Their lo&s;&s;es in that war were very great and yet their lo&s;&s;es in this &s;hew, that in a very little time they have more than repaired them. Wherever the vital principle &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in full vigour, wounds are &s;oon healed. Di&s;orders them&s;elves are a &s;pecies of remedies; and every new lo&s;s not only &s;hews how it may be repaired, but by the vigour it in&s;pires, makes new advantages known. Such lo&s;&s;es renew the &s;pirit of in|du&s;try and enterpri&s;e; they reduce things to
<PB N="17" REF="19">
their fir&s;t principles; they keep alive motion, and make the appetites of traders &s;harp and keen. This is the rea&s;on that amid&s;t their con|tinual wars, and the lo&s;&s;es all the nations of Europe &s;uffer from each other, they are al|mo&s;t all thriving. And if I may indulge a conjecture, it may be one among&s;t &s;everal of the cau&s;es that have reduced the trade of Holland, that &s;ince the treaty of Utrecht, now above forty years, they have had no war. They may, during the quarrels of other powers, appear to have derived great ad|vantages from their neutrality. But are they not with all this declining fa&s;t? And is not this country, which grew to be a nation, and to be a powerful trading and rich nation, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t bloody and expen&s;ive wars, now lo&s;ing it's trade, it's riches, and it's power, and almo&s;t cea&s;ing to be a nation, in the mid&s;t of a profound peace of upwards of forty years. We mu&s;t not place our depen|dance for keeping our&s;elves on a par of power with France, upon the prejudice which we can do it's trade in time of war, but upon the vigour, oeconomy, and wi&s;dom of the of mea|&s;ures which we take to &s;ecure and advance our own, both in war and in peace.</P>
<P>The large&s;t town in the French part of Hi&s;paniola is Cape Francoi&s;e, which is &s;itu|ated on the Northern part of the i&s;land upon a very fine harbour. It is well built, and
<PB N="18" REF="20">
contains about eight thou&s;and inhabitants, blacks and whites. But though this be large&s;t town, Leogane on the We&s;tern &s;ide, a good port too, and a place of con&s;iderable trade, is the &s;eat of government, which here re&s;ides in the hands of a governor and the inten|dant, who are mutually a check upon each other. There are be&s;ides two other towns, con&s;iderable for their trade. Petit Guaves on the We&s;t end of the i&s;land, and port Lo&uuml;is on the South-We&s;t part.</P>

<P>MArtinico is the next i&s;land in impor|tance, which the French po&s;&s;e&s;s in America. It is one of the Caribbees or Wind|ward i&s;lands, and the principal of them; about &s;ixty miles in length, and at a medium about half as much in breadth. It is forty leagues to the North-We&s;t of Barbadoes. It has pretty high hills, e&s;pecially in the inland part. From tho&s;e hills are poured out upon every &s;ide a number of agreeable and u&s;eful rivulets, which adorn and fructify this i&s;land in a high degree. The bays and harbours are numerous, &s;afe and commodious; and &s;o well fortified, that we have always failed in our attempts upon this place. The &s;oil is fruitful enough, abounding in the &s;ame things which our
<PB N="19" REF="21">
i&s;lands in that part of the world produce, and upon which I &s;hall the le&s;s in&s;i&s;t on that ac|count. Sugar is here, as it is in all the i&s;lands, the principal commodity, and great quantities are here made. Their export cannot be le&s;s than &s;ixty or &s;eventy thou&s;and hog&s;heads, of five or &s;ix hundred weight annually, and this certainly is no extravagant e&s;timation. Indigo, cotton, piemento or all&s;pice, ginger, and aloes, are rai&s;ed here; and coffee in great abund|ance; but to what value I cannot exactly &s;ay. Martinico is the re&s;idence of the governor of the French i&s;lands in the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>Guardaloupe is the large&s;t of all the Carib|bees, and in that divi&s;ion called the Leeward i&s;lands. It is almo&s;t cut in two by a deep gulph that clo&s;es the &s;ides of a narrow i&s;thmus, which connects the two penin&s;ulas that compo&s;e this i&s;land. It is upwards of &s;ixty miles long, and about the &s;ame breadth. It's &s;oil is not inferior to that of Martinico; it is equally cultivated; and it is fortified with equal &s;trength; it's produce is the &s;ame with that of Martinico; its export of &s;ugar is as great, be&s;ides indigo, cotton, and tho&s;e other com|modities, which are produced in all the i&s;lands of that part of America called the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the French i&s;lands in tho&s;e &s;eas are De&s;iada, St. Bartholomew, and Mari|galante; all of them incon&s;iderable in com|pari&s;on
<PB N="20" REF="22">
of tho&s;e which we have mentioned. They do not all together produce above &s;even or eight thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar. As for the i&s;land of St. Vincent, it is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the native Americans, and of runaway negroes from the re&s;t of the Caribbees. The French maintain them in this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Santa Lucia, or as it is often called, Sant Alouzie, of which the French are them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and have &s;ettled, contrary to the faith of treaties, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay any thing of it's produce; it has been &s;o newly planted, that it cannot as yet yield a great deal, and it is, even in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, much our fault if it ever yields a great deal to France. The&s;e i&s;lands, be&s;ides their &s;taple commodi|ties, &s;end home rocou, and brazil wood, in con&s;iderable quantities for the u&s;e of dyers, ca&s;&s;ia for the druggi&s;ts, and ro&s;ewood for joiners. The French have a &s;ettlement upon an i&s;land on the coa&s;t of Terra Firma in the province of Guiana, which they call Caen; and they claim be&s;ides a con&s;iderable part of the adjacent continent, but they have not much extended their &s;ettlements that way. The i&s;land is exce&s;&s;ively unhealthy, though not &s;o bad as formerly. The French here rai&s;e the &s;ame commodities which they have from the Caribbee i&s;lands, and in no incon|&s;iderable quantity.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">In e&s;timating the produce of the&s;e i&s;lands, it is not in my power to be very exact. I have made the be&s;t enquiries I could, and principally took care not to exaggerate. I have, indeed, make the produce of the Carib|bee i&s;lands very much greater than the inge|nious collector of Harris's voyages; but then I am the le&s;s fearful of differing from him, as he &s;eems a little to differ from him&s;elf, and not to have con&s;idered this point with his u&s;ual attention; for of Martinico he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"That as it is larger, &s;o it has many more inhabitants than Barbadoes, and produces more &s;ugars, &amp;c."</Q> And &s;peaking of Guardaloupe a little lower, he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline">"That it produces more &s;ugars than any of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands, except Jamaica;"</Q> and yet afterwards coming to &s;um up the products of all the&s;e i&s;lands, he allows but fifteen thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar, of about &s;ix hundred weight each, for the whole; when he makes the &s;ingle i&s;land of Barbadoes to yield double the quantity of &s;ugars which Martinico, Guardaloupe, and all the French Caribbees put together pro|duce. For he rates it in the year 1730, at twenty-two thou&s;and hog&s;heads, and upwards of thirteen hundred weight. He mu&s;t there|fore certainly have made &s;ome mi&s;take, ex|cu&s;able enough in &s;o va&s;t a work, which is executed in general in a very ma&s;terly manner.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">On the whole, from the be&s;t informations I can get, if the French do not greatly exceed, they certainly do not fall &s;hort of our i&s;lands in the quantity or goodne&s;s of their &s;ugars; and it is as certain, that they are le&s;s on the decline in that trade than we are; that they cultivate great quantities of indigo; a trade which our colonies in the We&s;t Indies have entirely lo&s;t; that within the&s;e few years they have &s;ent to France abundance of coffee, which our i&s;lands have not &s;ufficient encouragement to rai&s;e; and that upon the whole, we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be jealous of France in that part of the world. What advantages they derive from the noble i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola we have &s;een. What mu&s;t they do, if they come to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole of that i&s;land, which in the cutting and &s;huffling of a treaty of peace is no way im|po&s;&s;ible? We &s;hall then change the indolent Spaniard for the neighbourhood of the lively, vigilant, and enterpri&s;ing French. And what a rivalry in peace, and what a danger in war that neighbourhood is even now, and much more will probably be, is but too apparent. Jamaica is near it; and for &s;o valuable a po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion in &s;o dangerous a &s;ituation, perhaps not &s;o well defended. If be&s;ides this, the French &s;hould retain the i&s;lands of St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Tobago, though they &s;hould only turn them into plantations for fire wood, lumber, and provi&s;ions, as in &s;uch a ca&s;e it
<PB N="23" REF="25">
would &s;eem mo&s;t advi&s;eable to do with &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, what an advantage to their colonies! what an annoyance to ours! which they in a manner &s;urround, and can in a &s;ort hold be&s;ieged by the private armaments they may from thence fit out.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t mentioned i&s;lands were left neutral at the la&s;t peace; or in other words, they were left at the extinction of the old, in ju&s;t the order proper for kindling a new flame (though &s;uch a de&s;ign, I am convinced, was far from the in|tentions of one of the parties) and in all re&s;pects as if things were expre&s;&s;ly ordered for that very purpo&s;e. Indeed nothing can be attend|ed with wor&s;e con&s;equences than the&s;e poli|tical after-reckonings, which the party who has the advantage at making the peace, never finds it his account to &s;ettle or adju&s;t; but there they lie, full of matter of litigation; full of idle occa&s;ions for formal bu&s;ine&s;s; full of &s;trife, and of ill blood; and when a proper time occurs of bloody and expen&s;ive wars. It were better, at any rate, all at once to know what we are to depend upon; the be&s;t or the wor&s;t we have to expect. If on the conclu&s;ion of a peace, things &s;hould take for us &s;uch an unfortunate turn, we have &s;till great re&s;ources in the territories we po&s;&s;e&s;s. Jamaica is no|thing like fully cultivated. The Bahamas, our undi&s;puted right, where it is highly probable &s;ugars might be cultivated to advantage, re|main

at pre&s;ent utterly neglected, as if un|worthy of all notice, though they are many in number, large in extent, fruitful in their &s;oil, &s;ituated in a very happy climate, and are in a manner the keys of the We&s;t-India navi|gation. But we &s;hall pa&s;s by all reflections on this &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent, to look at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and claims of France upon the continent, which, if they were as well cultivated as they are fruitful and exten&s;ive, or as convenient objects of the French in|du&s;try as their i&s;lands, they would, I make no doubt, be at lea&s;t as advantageous to the trade, and add as much to the wealth and power of that flouri&s;hing kingdom.</P>

<P>THE French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and claims in North-America con&s;i&s;t of an immen&s;e inland country, communicating with the &s;ea by the mouths of two great rivers; both of difficult and dangerous navigation at the en|trance; and one of which is quite frozen for almo&s;t half the year, and covered with thick exhalations and fogs for the greater part of the re&s;t. They divide this va&s;t country, which has our colonies on the Ea&s;t and North-Ea&s;t; the Spani&s;h on the South-We&s;t and South-Ea&s;t; and to the We&s;tward that un|known tract of land which &s;tretches to the South-Sea; into two great provinces; the Northern of which they call Canada, and the Southern Loui&s;iana. But how far the bounds of the&s;e countries, extended to dimen&s;ions al|mo&s;t as great as all Europe, by the ambition of France, ought to be contracted by the rights of other powers, I &s;hall not undertake to determine; as after all, &s;uch que&s;tions mu&s;t be decided in a manner altogether different from any thing that can be &s;aid here.</P>
<P>Canada, which borders upon our provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-England, and New-York, is of a climate not altogether diffe|rent from theirs; but as it is much further from the &s;ea, and more Northerly than a great part of tho&s;e provinces, it has a much
<PB N="29" REF="28">
&s;everer winter; though the air is generally clear. The &s;oil is various; mo&s;tly barren; but the French have &s;ettlements where the land is equal in goodne&s;s to that in any of our colo|nies, and wants nothing but a better conve|nience of market to make it equally advan|tageous to the proprietors. It yields Indian corn very well in mo&s;t parts, and very fine wheat in &s;ome. All &s;orts of garden &s;tuff which grows in Europe flouri&s;hes here. But they rai&s;e no &s;taple commodity to an&s;wer their demands upon Old France; their trade with the Indians produces all their returns for that market. They are the furrs of the beaver prin|cipally, and tho&s;e of foxes and racoons, with deer-&s;kins, and all the branches of the Peltry. The&s;e, with what corn and lumber they &s;end to the We&s;t-Indies, to a people not very luxu|rious, nor extremely numerous, furni&s;h though very little money, yet wherewithal in a plen|tiful country, to render life ea&s;y and agreeable.</P>
<P>The nature of the climate &s;everely cold for the mo&s;t part, and the people ma|nufacturing nothing, &s;hews what the coun|try wants from Europe; wine, brandy, cloths, chiefly coar&s;e, linen, and wrought iron. The Indian trade requires brandy, to|bacco, a &s;ort of duffil blankets, guns, powder and ball, kettles, hatchets, and tomahawks, with &s;everal toys and trinkets. The Indians &s;upply the Peltry, and the French have traders,
<PB N="27" REF="29">
whom they call coureurs de bois, who, in the manner of the original inhabitants, traver&s;ing the va&s;t lakes and rivers that divide this country, in canoes of bark, with incredible in|du&s;try and patience, carry their goods into the remote&s;t parts of America, and among&s;t na|tions entirely unknown to us. This again brings the market home to them, as the Indians are hereby habituated to trade with them. For this purpo&s;e, people from all parts, even from the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and miles, come to the French fair of Mont-Real, which is held in June. On this occa&s;ion many &s;olem|nities are ob&s;erved; guards are placed, and the governor a&s;&s;i&s;ts to pre&s;erve order in &s;uch a concour&s;e of &s;uch a variety of &s;avage nations. The trade is now in that channel, for though many, if not mo&s;t of the&s;e nations, actually pa&s;s by our &s;ettlement of Albany in New-York, where they may have the goods they want cheaper con&s;iderably than at Mont-Real, they travel on above two hundred miles further, to buy the &s;ame commodities at the &s;e|cond hand, and enhanced by the expence of &s;o long a land carriage, at the French fair. For the French find it cheaper to buy our goods from the New-York merchants than to have them from their own, after &s;o bad and &s;o tedious a pa&s;&s;age as it is from the mouth of the river St. Laurence to Mont-Real. So much do the French exceed us in indu&s;try, oeconomy, and
<PB N="28" REF="30">
the arts of conciliating the affections of man|kind; things that even ballance all the di&s;ad|vantages they naturally labour under in this country. Our fort of O&s;wego was well planned for &s;ecuring the Indian trade, and actually brought us a great part of it. But it is now no longer an interruption to the French commerce.</P>
<P>Having mentioned Mont-Real, I have only to ob&s;erve, that this town is &s;ituated in an i&s;land in the river of St. Laurence, in the country of the Iroquois. The river is only navigable hither by canoes, or &s;mall craft, having &s;everal falls between this town and Quebec. Yet this Indian fair, and the trade of the &s;ame kind, which they drive more or le&s;s for the whole year, make it no incon&s;ide|rable place. It contains about three thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P>Quebec, the capital, lies many leagues nearer the &s;ea; from which, however, it is one hundred and fifty leagues di&s;tant. The river, which from the &s;ea hither is ten or twelve miles broad, narrows all of a &s;udden to about a mile wide. The town is divided into an upper and a lower. In both the fortifica|tions are &s;trong, and the hou&s;es well built. They have a grand cathedral and epi&s;copal palace, a hand&s;ome college of je&s;uits; three mona&s;teries of men, and as many of women; and the town is covered by a regular and
<PB N="29" REF="31">
beautiful citadel, in which the governor re&s;ides. This city, though the capital of Canada, is however not very large. It contains about &s;even or eight thou&s;and inhabitants at the utmo&s;t. Ships of any burthen load and un|load here, and a good many are built.</P>
<P>From Quebec to Mont-Real, which is about one hundred and fifty miles di&s;tance, the country on both &s;ides the river is very well &s;ettled, and has an agreeable effect upon the eye. The farms lie pretty clo&s;e all the way; &s;everal gentlemen's hou&s;es, neatly built, &s;hew them&s;elves at intervals; and there is all the appearance of a flouri&s;hing colony; but there are no towns or villages. It is pretty much like the well-&s;ettled parts of our colonies of Virginia and Maryland, where the planters are wholly within them&s;elves.</P>
<P>With all the attention of the court of France to the trade and peopling of this, as well as their other colonies on the continent, they have not been yet able thoroughly to over|come the con&s;equences of tho&s;e difficulties which the climate, whil&s;t the place was un|&s;ettled, threw in their way; their lo&s;&s;es in the wars with that brave and fierce nation the Iro|quois, who more than once reduced their colo|ny to the la&s;t extremity, and the bad navigation of the river St. Laurence, which is an evil in|curable, have kept back the colony. Therefore, though it is the olde&s;t of all the French e&s;ta|bli&s;hments,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
and prior to our &s;ettlement of New-England, the inhabitants are not above one hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls. Some indeed of late reckon them but at forty thou&s;and. An error this very prejudicial to our affairs, whil&s;t we overvalued our own &s;trength, and under|rated the force of the enemy, and acted in a good mea&s;ure in conformity to &s;uch ideas; but even this number, as I e&s;timate it, which I believe is not far from the reality, might be no ju&s;t cau&s;e of dread to our colonies, if they managed the &s;trength they have, and which is certainly much &s;uperior, with &s;kill and effect. The French from theirs, though inferior, have &s;even or eight thou&s;and militia hardy and well di&s;ciplined, always in readine&s;s to co|operate with their regular troops; and there is nothing which may hinder or retard their operations from within them&s;elves. It is there|fore not more the French intrigues and their intermarriages with the Indians, which fix that people in the French intere&s;t, than the &s;uccours which they are always &s;ure to have from &s;uch a force, ever in readine&s;s to pro|tect them whil&s;t they remain their friends, or to puni&s;h them whenever they dare to appear as enemies. With us the ca&s;e is quite other|wi&s;e. This &s;avage people commence ho&s;tili|ties again&s;t us without any previous notice, and often without any provocation, they com|mit the mo&s;t horrid ravages for a long time
<PB N="31" REF="33">
with impunity. But when at la&s;t their barba|rities have rou&s;ed the &s;leeping &s;trength of our people, at the &s;ame time too that they have con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened it, they are not a&s;hamed to beg a peace; they know we always grant it readily; they promi&s;e it &s;hall endure as long as the &s;un and moon; and then all is quiet, till the French intrigues, co-operating with our indo|lence, give them once more an opportunity of ravaging our colonies, and of once more re|newing a peace to be broken like all the former.</P>
<P>The great river St. Laurence is that only upon which the French have &s;ettlements of any note; but if we look forward into futu|rity, it is nothing improbable that this va&s;t country, whoever then &s;hall be the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it, will be enabled of it&s;elf to carry on a va&s;t trade upon the&s;e great &s;eas of fre&s;h water which it environs. Here are five lakes, the &s;malle&s;t of which is a piece of &s;weet water greater than any in the other parts of the world; this is the lake Ontario, which is not le&s;s than two hundred leagues in circum|ference; Erie longer, but not &s;o broad, is about the &s;ame extent. That of the Hurons &s;preads greatly in width, and is in circum|ference not le&s;s than three hundred; as is that of Michigan, though like lake Erie, it is rather long and comparatively narrow. But
<PB N="32" REF="34">
the lake Superior, which contains &s;everal large i&s;lands, is five hundred leagues in the circuit. All of the&s;e are navigable by any ve&s;&s;els, and they all communicate with one another, ex|cept that the pa&s;&s;age between Erie and Ontario is interrupted by the &s;tupendous cataract of Niagara, where the water tumbles down a pre|cipice of twenty-&s;ix fathom high, and makes in this fall a thundering noi&s;e, which is heard all round the country at the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles. The river St. Laurence is the outlet of the&s;e lakes; by this they di&s;charge them|&s;elves into the ocean. The French have built forts at the &s;everal &s;traits, by which the&s;e lakes communicate with each other, as well as where the la&s;t of them communicates with the river St. Laurence. By the&s;e they effectually &s;ecure to them&s;elves the trade of the lakes, and an influence upon all the nations of Americans which confine upon them.</P>
<P>They have but one &s;ettlement more in the Northern part of their territories in America, which de&s;erves con&s;ideration; but that &s;ettle|ment, though a &s;mall one, is perhaps of more con&s;equence than all the re&s;t. It is the i&s;land of Cape Breton. This i&s;land properly be|longs to the divi&s;ion of Acadia or Nova-Scotia, and it is the only part of it which has not been ceded by treaty to Great-Britain. It is about one hundred and forty miles in length,
<PB N="33" REF="35">
full of mountains and lakes, and inter&s;ected by a va&s;t number of creeks and bays, almo&s;t meeting each other upon every &s;ide; which &s;eems in general both for the coa&s;t and in|land, very much to re&s;emble the coa&s;t and inland parts of mo&s;t Northern countries. Scot|land is &s;o; &s;o is Iceland; and Denmark and Sweden have &s;uch &s;hores, &s;uch mountains, and &s;uch lakes. However, the &s;oil is in many places &s;ufficiently fruitful; and in every part abounds with timber fit for all u&s;es. In the earth are coal-pits; and on the &s;hores one of the mo&s;t valuable fi&s;heries in the world. The only town in this i&s;land is Loui&s;bourg. It &s;tands upon one of the fine&s;t harbours in all America. This harbour is four leagues in circumference, landlocked every way but at the mouth, which is narrow; and within there is fine anchorage every where in &s;even fathom water. The town it&s;elf is of a tole|rable &s;ize, and well built and fortified. The harbour is defended by batteries of cannon and forts, which &s;ecure it at this day, perhaps too effectually. This harbour is open the whole year. The French &s;hips that carry goods to Quebec can very &s;eldom get their full loading there, therefore on their return they put into Loui&s;bourg, and there take in a quantity of fi&s;h, coal, and &s;ome lumber, and then &s;ail away to the French i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies, where they vend the&s;e, and &s;oon
<PB N="34" REF="36">
complete their cargo with &s;ugars. It is need|le&s;s to ob&s;erve that this i&s;land was taken by us in the late war, but re&s;tored by the treaty of Aix la Chapelle, in which we certainly were not in &s;uch a condition as to intitle us to pre&s;cribe the terms.</P>

<P>THE French have called the South part of the va&s;t tract which they claim in America, Loui&s;iana. It was heretofore a part of Florida. It is bounded by the gulph of Mexico upon the South. But what bounds it is to have to the Ea&s;t and to the We&s;t, it is to be wi&s;hed the next treaty of peace may &s;ettle definitively. This is in all re&s;pects a much finer country than Canada; in a delicious cli|mate, capable of bearing almo&s;t any thing from the temper of the &s;ky, and the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil, and from the multitude of long, deep, and beautiful rivers, with which it is every where enriched and adorned; the&s;e are mo&s;t of them navigable for hundreds of miles into the country. They are princi|pally the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, who&s;e head is unknown, but it almo&s;t goes quite through North Ame|rica, and at certain &s;ea&s;ons overflows it's banks for a va&s;t way on both &s;ides. The Ohio, a river almo&s;t equal to the Danube, which falls
<PB N="35" REF="37">
into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; the Ouabache, &s;carce in|ferior to the Ohio; the great rivers, Alibama, Mobile, and &s;everal others. The face of the country is almo&s;t wholly plain, covered with &s;tately woods, or &s;pread into very fine mea|dows. In &s;hort, Loui&s;iana, particularly the Northern part, (for the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi is barren) without any of the&s;e height|enings which it received, when it was made the in&s;trument to captivate &s;o many to their ruin, is in all re&s;pects a mo&s;t de&s;irable place, though there be no &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to believe that it contains any rich metals, which gave it the greate&s;t influence in that remarkable de|lu&s;ion in 1720.</P>
<P>I know not how it has happened, but it has been the fate of this country to create romantic ideas at all times. Very &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tories were told of it when fir&s;t the Spaniards di&s;|covered the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. Among&s;t others, a notion was generally current, that there was a fountain here which perpetually renewed the youth of tho&s;e who drank it. This was &s;o uniformly and confidently affirm|ed, that Juan Pontio de Leon, a con&s;iderable man among&s;t the Spani&s;h adventurers, gave credit to it, and made a particular expedition for the di&s;covery of that fairy land, and that fountain of youth. He was the fir&s;t of the Europeans who landed in Florida. But what &s;ucce&s;s &s;oever he met in his &s;earch for that
<PB N="36" REF="38">
celebrated &s;pring, it is certain he died not long after, having &s;earched every part of the country, and drank of almo&s;t every water it contained. Nor do I find that &s;o invaluable a &s;pring is yet di&s;covered there; if it were, it would undoubtedly be the be&s;t commodity the country could yield, both for dome&s;tic con&s;umption, and for the foreign markets, and would be a far better ba&s;is for &s;tocks and funds than the riche&s;t mines of gold or &s;ilver. Yet, without this, an idea, altogether as ro|mantic, of a trade hither operated &s;o &s;trongly upon a very wi&s;e nation, as to &s;erve for the in&s;trument of one of tho&s;e dangerous ma&s;ter-&s;trokes in politics, by which nations are &s;ometimes &s;aved, individuals undone, and an entire change and rever&s;ement brought about, not only in the common ways of thinking of mankind, but of all that &s;eemed mo&s;t fixed and permanent in a &s;tate. The famous Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi &s;cheme in France was of this nature, and built upon &s;uch a romantic foundation. It is well known to all the world, both on it's own account, and upon account of a &s;imilar mad|ne&s;s that prevailed here, without perhaps being attended with &s;uch advantageous con&s;equen|ces.</P>
<P>The French &s;ettled in Loui&s;iana rai&s;e &s;ome indigo, a good deal of cotton, &s;ome corn and rice, with lumber for their i&s;lands; but the colony is not very vigorous, on account of the
<PB N="37" REF="39">
&s;hoals and &s;ands with which the mouth of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi is in a manner choaked up, and which deny acce&s;s to ve&s;&s;els of any con&s;iderable burthen. This keeps the inha|bitants low; but the cau&s;e which keeps them from growing rich contributes too to their &s;e|curity; for it is not ea&s;y to act with any great force upon that &s;ide. But the French have not relied upon this advantage; but according to their u&s;ual cautious and wi&s;e cu&s;tom, have erected &s;everal forts in the mo&s;t material places, and fortified New Orleans their capital, and indeed only city in Loui&s;iana, in a regular manner. This city is not remarkably fair, large, or rich. The whole colony is &s;aid not to contain above ten thou&s;and &s;ouls, whites and negroes. Yet with all it's di&s;advantages, this colony is not declining; and if ever they &s;hould make the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi more tract|able; and what is impo&s;&s;ible to ambition and indu&s;try? if they &s;hould come to fully po&s;&s;e&s;s and &s;ettle the Ohio, which at one &s;ea&s;on over|flows, and makes &s;uch flood as to level all the falls almo&s;t from it's very &s;ource to the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and gives a pa&s;&s;age all that way to very con&s;iderable ve&s;&s;els, (though they have not quite the &s;ame ea&s;y return); and if by this and other means they &s;hould contrive a communication between Canada and the &s;ettlement at Loui&s;iana, whil&s;t they entirely confine us between our mountains and the &s;ea,
<PB N="38" REF="40">
Loui&s;iana in a few years will wear quite ano|ther face. It will &s;upply their We&s;t-Indies with boards, &s;taves, hor&s;es, mules, and provi|&s;ions. It will &s;end tobacco into France; and increa&s;ing the conveniencies of it's mother country, and &s;i&s;ter colonies, it will increa&s;e it's own traffic, it's inhabitants, and it's power. We have &s;een how the French We&s;t-Indies in le&s;s than forty years, from a condition which could excite no other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion, are ri&s;en to &s;uch a pitch as to be an object of great and ju&s;t terror to her neighbours; and we now feel too, that the French &s;ettlements in North America, even &s;uch as they are, are not an undermatch for the whole force of our's, in the manner at lea&s;t in which that force is exerted.</P>

<P>THAT we may not &s;it down in a &s;en&s;e|le&s;s admiration of this progre&s;s of the French colonies, as if it were the work of fortune, it will not be ami&s;s to open &s;ome|thing of the wi&s;e plan of conduct which France has pur&s;ued with regard to this inte|re&s;ting object. Sen&s;ible that as the mother country is to receive ultimately all the bene|fits of their labours and acqui&s;itions, &s;o all the pro&s;perity of their plantations mu&s;t be derived
<PB N="39" REF="41">
from the attention with which they are re|garded at home. For which rea&s;on the plan|tations are particularly under the care and in|&s;pection of the council of commerce; a board very judiciou&s;ly con&s;tituted to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which it is de&s;igned. For to give it a proper re&s;pect and authority, it is compo&s;|ed of twelve of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable officers of the crown; and then to enable it to judge perfectly of the matters which come before it, the&s;e twelve are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the deputies of all the con&s;iderable trading towns and cities in France, who are cho&s;en out of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t intelligent of their traders, and paid an hand&s;ome &s;alary for their attendance at Paris, from the funds of their re&s;pective cities. This council &s;its once a week. The deputies pro|po&s;e plans for redre&s;&s;ing every grievance in trade; for rai&s;ing the branches that are fallen; for extending new ones; for &s;upporting the old; and in fine for every thing that may improve the working, or promote the vent of their manufactures, according to their own lights, or to the in&s;tructions of their con&s;ti|tuents. They have a watchful eye upon every article of commerce; and they not only pro|po&s;e helps and improvements to it them&s;elves, but they hear the propo&s;als of others, which are not di&s;dainfully rejected, nor ra&s;hly re|ceived. They do not render the acce&s;s to them difficult, by &s;welling them&s;elves into a
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;tiff and unwieldy &s;tate. They do not di&s;|courage tho&s;e who apply, by admitting the vexatious practice of fees, perqui&s;ites, and ex|actions, in their inferior officers. They do not &s;uffer form and methods to load and encumber that bu&s;ine&s;s, they were &s;olely intended to ad|vance. They &s;ummon and examine tho&s;e who are &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t competent judges of the matter before them, and of every part of it, even the lowe&s;t artizans: but though they examine tho&s;e men, they are in&s;tructed by their experience, not determined by their opinion. When they are &s;atisfied of the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of any regulation, they propo&s;e it to the royal council, where their report is al|ways received with particular attention. An edict to enforce it i&s;&s;ues accordingly; and it is executed with a punctuality which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes their government, and which alone can make the wi&s;e&s;t regulations any thing better than &s;erious mockeries. To the care of this excellent body the plantations are par|ticularly entru&s;ted.</P>
<P>The government of the &s;everal divi&s;ions of their colonies is in a governor, an intendant, and a royal council. The governor is in|ve&s;ted with a great deal of power; which however, on the &s;ide of the crown, is checked by the intendant, who has the care of the king's rights, and whatever relates to the re|venue; and on the &s;ide of the people, it is
<PB N="41" REF="43">
checked by the royal council, who&s;e office it is, to &s;ee that the people are not oppre&s;&s;ed by the one, nor defrauded by the other; and they are all checked by the con&s;tant and jealous eye which the government at home keeps over them. For the officers at all the ports of France are charged under the &s;everal penalties, to in|terrogate all captains of &s;hips coming from the colonies concerning the reception they met at the ports they were bound to; how ju&s;tice was admini&s;tred to them? what charges they were made liable to, and of what kinds? The pa&s;&s;engers, and even the &s;ailors are exa|mined upon the&s;e heads, and a verbal proce&s;s of the whole is formed and tran&s;mitted with all &s;peed to the admiralty. Complaints are encouraged; but a difference is made between hearing an accu&s;ation and condemning upon it.</P>
<P>That the colonies may have as little load as po&s;&s;ible, and that the governor may have le&s;s temptation to &s;tir up trouble&s;ome in|trigues, or favour factions in his government, his &s;alary is paid by the crown. His per|qui&s;ites are none; and he is &s;trictly forbidden to carry on any trade, or to have any planta|tions in the i&s;lands, or on the continent, or any intere&s;t what&s;oever in goods or lands within his government, except the hou&s;e he lives in, and a garden for his convenience and recreation. All the other officers are
<PB N="42" REF="44">
paid by the crown, and out of the revenues of Old France; the fortification are built and repaired, and the &s;oldiers are paid out of the &s;ame funds.</P>
<P>In general the colonies pay no taxes; but when upon an extraordinary emergency taxes have been rai&s;ed, they were very moderate. And, that even the taxes might operate for the advancement of the colony, they who began new plantations, were exempted from them. The duties upon the export of their produce at the i&s;lands, or at it's import into France, is next to nothing; in both places hardly mak|ing two per cent. What commodities go to them, pay no duties at all.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e advantages, a con&s;iderable be|nefit accrues to &s;uch of the colonies as are poor, as Canada, by the money which comes from France to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hment. This brings into Canada about 120,000 crowns a year, which finds them circulating ca&s;h; pre|&s;erves them from the dangerous expedient of a paper currency; enables them to keep up their intercour&s;e with &s;ome credit, with their mother country; and at the &s;ame time is in fact no lo&s;s at all to it, &s;ince the money re|turns home almo&s;t as &s;oon as it can po&s;&s;ibly be tran&s;ported back again.</P>
<P>In all their i&s;lands, judges of the admiralty are appointed to decide in a &s;ummary manner all di&s;putes between merchants, and what&s;o|ever
<PB N="43" REF="45">
el&s;e has any relation to trade. The&s;e judges are &s;trictly examined before they are appointed, particularly as to their &s;kill in the marine laws, which have been improv|ed and dige&s;ted in France with &s;o much care and good &s;en&s;e, that all law &s;uits are quick|ly over; though in other re&s;pects the practice of law admits of as much chicanery, and has as many, if not more delays, than with us.</P>
<P>After having taken &s;uch precautions to &s;e|cure the good government of the colony with|in it&s;elf, and to make it's communication with the mother country ea&s;y and beneficial to both &s;ides, all would be to very little pur|po&s;e, if they had not provided with equal care to have the country repleni&s;hed with people. To an&s;wer this end, they oblige every &s;hip which departs from France for America, to carry a certain number of indent|ed &s;ervants. All ve&s;&s;els of &s;ixty tuns or un|der are to carry three; from &s;ixty to a hund|red, four; and from a hundred upwards, &s;ix &s;ervants; &s;ound &s;trong bodies, between the ages of eighteen and forty. Before their de|parture, the &s;ervants are examined by the offi|cers of the admiralty, to &s;ee whether they are the per&s;ons required by law; an examina|tion to the &s;ame purpo&s;e is made by the com|mi&s;&s;ary on their landing in America. They are to &s;erve three years. The avarice of the planters makes them always prefer negroe
<PB N="44" REF="46">
&s;laves, becau&s;e they are more obedient than the Europeans, may be more worked, are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with le&s;s difficulty, and are be&s;ides the entire property of their ma&s;ter. This di&s;|po&s;ition, in time, would render the &s;afety of the colony extremely precarious, whil&s;t it made the colony it&s;elf of le&s;s value to the mo|ther country. Therefore the planters are by law obliged to keep a certain number of white &s;ervants in proportion to their blacks; and the execution of this law is inforced by the commi&s;&s;ary, who adju&s;ts the price, and forces the planters to take the number of &s;ervants required by the ordinance, who would other|wi&s;e be a burthen upon the hands of the ma&s;|ters of &s;hips who brought them over.</P>
<P>They con&s;ider the planter, as a Frenchman venturing his life, enduring a &s;pecies of ba|ni&s;hment, and undergoing great hard&s;hips for the benefit of his country. For which rea&s;ons, he has great indulgence &s;hewn him. When|ever by hurricanes, earthquakes, or bad &s;ea&s;ons, the planters &s;uffer, a &s;top is put to the rigour of exacting creditors; the few taxes which are levied, are remitted; and even money is advanced to repair their lo&s;&s;es and &s;et them forward. To tho&s;e who are poor, but &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to indu&s;try, nece&s;&s;aries and &s;mall &s;ums are lent, to make a beginning; and this money is taken in gradually, and by very &s;mall payments. On the other hand, as it
<PB N="45" REF="47">
can be of no advantage to the planter to run fraudulently into debt, but that it is of the greate&s;t prejudice to the French merchant, all debts, though contracted by the planters in France, are levied with great ea&s;e. The proce&s;s, properly authenticated, is tran&s;mit|ted to America, and admitted as proved there, and levied on the planter's e&s;tate, of what&s;o|ever kind it may be. However, care is taken, that whil&s;t compul&s;ory methods are u&s;ed to make the planter do ju&s;tice, the &s;tate &s;hall not lo&s;e the indu&s;try of an u&s;eful member of the community; the debt is always levied ac|cording to the &s;ub&s;tance of the debtor, and by in&s;tallments; &s;o that (what ought indeed to be the ca&s;e in every well-regulated government) one of the parties is not &s;acrificed to the other. Both &s;ub&s;i&s;t; the creditor is &s;ati&s;fied; the debtor is not ruined; and the credit of the colonies is kept in health and vigour at home, by the &s;ure methods which are in u&s;e for re|covering all demands in the plantations.</P>
<P>As to the negroes, they are not left as they are with us, wholly, body and &s;oul to the di&s;cretion of the planter. Their ma&s;ters are obliged to have them in&s;tructed in the princi|ples of religion. There are methods taken at once to protect the &s;laves from the cruelty of their owners, and to pre&s;erve the colony from the ill effects, that might ari&s;e from treat|ing them with a lenity not con&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="46" REF="48">
their condition. In &s;hort, the Code Noir, and other ordinances relative to the&s;e poor creatures, &s;hew a very ju&s;t and &s;en&s;ible mix|ture of humanity and &s;teadine&s;s. There is however one error, their planters commit in common with ours; which is, that they over|work the&s;e unhappy men in a manner not &s;uitable to the nature of the climate, or to their con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer upon the French policy as it regards their colonies, becau&s;e it is ju&s;t to give due honour to all tho&s;e, who ad|vance the intercour&s;e of mankind, the peo|pling of the earth, and the advantage of their country by wi&s;e and effectual regulations. But I principally in&s;i&s;t upon it, that it may, if po&s;|&s;ible, &s;erve for an example to our&s;elves; that it may excite an emulation in us; that it may help to rou&s;e us out of that languor into which we &s;eem to be fallen. The war we now car|ry on, principally regards our colonies, and is a &s;ufficient proof that we are come at la&s;t to know their value. But if we are not to hope for better &s;ucce&s;s than has hitherto attended a very ju&s;t cau&s;e, the next peace will probably contract the field we hoped to lay open to our indu&s;try in America. But then, we ought there|fore to cultivate what &s;till remains of it, with tenfold indu&s;try; we ought to guard with the mo&s;t unremitting vigilance that enclo&s;ed &s;pring, that &s;ealed fountain, the waters of
<PB N="47" REF="49">
which we re&s;erve to our&s;elves, and direct into &s;uch channels, and make to pur&s;ue &s;uch wind|ings and turnings as be&s;t &s;erve our purpo&s;es. We have, I believe, pretty well di&s;covered mo&s;t of our errors, and the advantage our enemy and rival has taken, not only of our &s;u|pinene&s;s, but of a contrary genius in his own councils. We ought to rou&s;e our&s;elves from the former, and prepare to imitate the latter. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to fight again&s;t Alexander, not to rail at him. And truly, I do not know any thing, that for this long time pa&s;t has contributed more to degrade our character for humanity in the eyes of foreigners, or to in&s;til into our&s;elves a low and illiberal way of thinking, than that vein of licentious &s;currility and abu&s;e, by which, in all &s;orts of writings, we are apt to vilify and traduce the French na|tion. There is nothing, which hinders peo|ple from acting properly, more than indulg|ing them&s;elves in a vain and effeminate licence of tongue. A man who loves his country, and can at once oppo&s;e, and e&s;teem an ene|my, would view our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances in a light, I conceive, &s;omewhat like the fol|lowing. We have been engaged for above a century with France in a noble contention for the &s;uperiority in arms, in politics, in learn|ing, and in commerce; and there never was a time, perhaps, when this &s;truggle was more critical. If we &s;ucceed in the war; even our
<PB N="48" REF="50">
&s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s managed with prudence, will be like &s;ome former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, of little benefit to us; if we &s;hould fail, which God forbid, even then, prudence may make our mi&s;fortunes of more u&s;e to us, than an ill-managed &s;uc|ce&s;s; if they teach us to avoid our former errors; if they make us le&s;s carele&s;s; if they make us cultivate the advantages we have with care and judgment. This, and not our opinion of the ene|my, mu&s;t decide the long conte&s;t between us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. The Dutch Settlements.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the Portugue&s;e had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Dutch of Brazil in the manner we have &s;een; and after the treaty of Nimeguen had entirely removed them out of North America, they were obliged to con&s;ole them|&s;elves with their rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and to &s;it down content in the We&s;t with Surinam; a country on the North-Ea&s;t part of South-America, and of no great value whil&s;t we had it, and which we ceded to them in exchange for New-York; and with two or three &s;mall and barren i&s;lands in the North-&s;ea not far from the Spani&s;h main. The former of the&s;e, they are far from neglecting; they rai&s;e &s;ome &s;ugar in Surinam; a great deal of cotton; coffee of an excellent kind, and
<PB N="49" REF="51">
&s;ome valuable dying drugs. They trade with our North American colonies, who bring hither hor&s;es, live cattle and provi&s;ions, and take home a large quantity of mola&s;&s;es; but their negroes are only the refu&s;e of tho&s;e they have for the Spani&s;h market; and the Indians in their neighbourhood are their mortal ene|mies. On the &s;ame continent they have three other &s;ettlements at no con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other. Boron, Berbice, and Ap|prowack; none very great, but producing the &s;ame commodities with Surinam.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, are four, Cura&s;&s;ou, St. Eu&s;tatia, Aruba and Bonaire; none of them large or fertile, but turned to the be&s;t advantage po&s;&s;ible by that &s;pirit of indu&s;try for which the Dutch are &s;o ju&s;tly fa|mous. Curaccao, or Cura&s;&s;ou, as it is generally called, is about thirty miles long and ten in breath. Though it is naturally barren it pro|duces a con&s;iderable quantity both of &s;ugar and tobacco, and here are be&s;ides very great &s;alt-works, which furni&s;h a good deal to the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, and for which there is a con&s;i|derable demand from our colonies on the con|tinent; but the trade for which this i&s;land is chiefly valuable, is that which in time of war is carried on between them, the Engli&s;h, and the French; and the counterband which is carried on between them and the Spaniards at all times.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">The Dutch ve&s;&s;els from Europe touch at this i&s;land for intelligence or proper pilots, and then proceed to the Spani&s;h coa&s;t upon a trade which they force with a &s;trong hand. It is very difficult for the Spani&s;h guarda co&s;tas to take the&s;e ve&s;&s;els; for they are not only &s;tout &s;hips with a number of guns; but by a very wi&s;e policy manned with a large crew of cho&s;en &s;eamen, who are all deeply intere&s;ted in the &s;afety of the ve&s;&s;el and the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage. They have each a &s;hare in the cargo of a value proportioned to the owner's &s;tation, &s;upplied by the merchants upon cre|dit, and at prime co&s;t. This animates them with an uncommon courage; they fight brave|ly, becau&s;e every man fights in defence of his own property. But there is be&s;ides this, a con&s;tant intercour&s;e between the Spani&s;h con|tinent and this i&s;land.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Cura&s;&s;ou has it's numerous warehou&s;es always full of the commodities of Europe, and the Ea&s;t-Indies. Here are all &s;orts of woollen and linen cloths, laces, &s;ilks, ribbands, uten&s;ils of iron, naval and military &s;tores, brandy, the &s;pices of the Moluccas, and the callicoes of India, white and painted. Hither the We&s;t-India, which is likewi&s;e their African company, bring three or four cargoes of &s;laves annually. To this mart, the Spaniards come them&s;elves in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and carry off not only the be&s;t of their ne|groes,
<PB N="51" REF="53">
and at the be&s;t price, but very great quantities of all the &s;orts of goods I have men|tioned; with this advantage to the &s;eller, that the refu&s;e of warehou&s;es and mercers &s;hops, things grown utterly unfa&s;hionable and un&s;ale|able in Europe, go off extremely well, where every thing is &s;ufficiently recommended by be|ing European. They leave here their gold and &s;ilver in bars or coined, cacao, vanilla, cochineal, je&s;uit's bark, hides, and other va|luable commodities. The &s;hips that trade di|rectly from Holland to the Spani&s;h continent, as they touch here on their outward pa&s;&s;age to gain intelligence or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, on their return put in here likewi&s;e to compleat what is wan|ting of their cargo, with the &s;ugar, the tobac|co, the ginger, and other produce of the i&s;land it&s;elf. The trade of this i&s;land, even in times of peace, is reputed to be worth to the Dutch no le&s;s than 500,000 l. &s;terl. annually, but in time of war the profit is far greater, for then it is in a manner the common emporium of the We&s;t-Indies; it affords a retreat to the &s;hips of all nations, and at the &s;ame time re|fu&s;es to none of them arms and ammunition to annoy one another. The intercour&s;e with Spain being interrupted, the Spani&s;h colonies have &s;carce any other market, from whence they can be well &s;upplied either with &s;laves or goods; the French come hither to buy the beef, pork, corn, flour and lumber, which
<PB N="52" REF="54">
the Engli&s;h bring from the continent of North America, or which is tran&s;ported from Ireland; &s;o that whether in peace, or in war, the trade of this i&s;land flouri&s;hes extremely. Nor is this owing to any natural advantage what&s;oever. It &s;eems as if it were fated, that the ingenuity and patience of the Hollanders &s;hould every where, both in Europe and America, be em|ployed in fighting again&s;t an unfriendly nature: for the i&s;land is not only barren, and dependent upon the rains for it's water, but the harbour is naturally one of the wor&s;t in America; but the Dutch have entirely remedied that defect; they have upon this harbour one of the large&s;t, and by far the mo&s;t elegant and cleanly towns in the American i&s;lands. The public build|ings are numerous and hand&s;ome; the private hou&s;es commodious; and the magazines large, convenient, and well filled. All kind of labour is here performed by engines; &s;ome of them &s;o dextrou&s;ly contrived, that &s;hips are at once lifted into the dock, where they are compleat|ly careened; and then furni&s;hed with naval &s;tores, provi&s;ions, cannon, and every thing re|qui&s;ite either for trade or war.</P>
<P>Eu&s;tatia is but one mountain of about twen|ty miles in compa&s;s; it is among&s;t the Lee|ward i&s;lands; but though &s;o &s;mall and inconve|niently laid out by nature, the indu&s;try of the Dutch have made it turn out to very good ac|count, and it is fully peopled; the &s;ides of the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
mountain are divided and laid out in very pretty &s;ettlements; and though they have neither &s;prings nor rivers, they are &s;o careful that they never want proper &s;upplies of water from their ponds and ci&s;terns. They rai&s;e here &s;ugar and tobacco; and this i&s;land, as well as Cura&s;&s;ou, is engaged in the Spani&s;h counterband trade, for which, however, it is not &s;o well &s;ituated; and it draws the &s;ame advantages from it's con&s;tant neutrality.</P>
<P>As for Aruba and Bonaire; they lie near Cura&s;&s;ou, and have no trade of con&s;equence; they are chiefly employed in rai&s;ing fre&s;h provi&s;ions for the principal i&s;land, and for the refre&s;hment of &s;uch &s;hips as u&s;e the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>The trade of all the Dutch American &s;ettle|ments was originally carried on by the We&s;t-India company only. At pre&s;ent &s;uch &s;hips as go upon that trade pay two and a half per cent. For their licences; the company however re&s;erves to it&s;elf, the whole of what is carried on between Africa and the American i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Danes had likewi&s;e a We&s;t-India com|pany, though it's object was far from exten&s;ive. It was little more than the i&s;land of St. Tho|mas, an incon&s;iderable member of the Carib|bees; lately they have added to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons the i&s;land of Santa Cruz in the &s;ame clu&s;ter. The&s;e i&s;lands, &s;o long as they remain|ed in the hands of the company, were ill managed, and nothing like the proper advan|tage
<PB N="54" REF="56">
was made of them; but the pre&s;ent king of Denmark, inferior to none who ever &s;at up|on that or any other throne, in love to his &s;ubjects, and a judicious zeal for promoting their welfare, has bought up that company's &s;tock, and laid the trade open. Since then, the old &s;ettlement at St. Thomas is very much improved; it produces upwards of three thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar at a thou|&s;and weight each, and others of the We&s;t-In|dian commodities in tolerable plenty; and as for Santa Cruz, from a perfect de&s;art a few years &s;ince, it is beginning to &s;ettle fa&s;t; &s;eve|ral per&s;ons from the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, and among&s;t them &s;ome of great wealth, have gone to &s;ettle there, and have received very great encouragement to do &s;o. The air of the place is extremely unhealthful, but this ill di&s;po&s;ition will probably continue no longer than the woods with which the i&s;land at pre&s;ent is almo&s;t wholly covered. The&s;e two nations, the Dutch and Danes, hardly de&s;erve to be mentioned among&s;t the proprietors of America; their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there are compara|tively nothing. But as they appear extreme|ly worthy of the attention of the&s;e powers, and as the &s;hare of the Dutch is worth to them at lea&s;t &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year, what mu&s;t we think of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? What attention do they not de&s;erve from us? and what may not be made of them by that attention?</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="57">There &s;eems to be a remarkable providence in the ca&s;ting the parts, if I may u&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion, of the &s;everal European nations who act upon the &s;tage of America. The Spaniards, proud, lazy and magnificent, has an ample walk in which to expatiate; a &s;oft climate to indulge his love of ea&s;e; and a profu&s;ion of gold and &s;ilver to procure him all the&s;e luxuries his pride demands, but which his lazine&s;s would refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e, naturally indigent at home, and enterpri&s;ing rather than indu&s;trious abroad, has gold and diamonds as the Spaniard has, wants them as he does, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them in a more u&s;eful, though a le&s;s o&s;tentatious manner.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h, of a rea&s;oning di&s;po&s;ition, thoughtful and cool, and men of bu&s;ine&s;s rather than of great indu&s;try, impatient of much fruitle&s;s labour, abhorrent of con&s;traint, and lovers of a country life, have a lot which indeed produces neither gold nor &s;ilver; but they have a large tract of a fine continent; a noble field for the exerci&s;e of agriculture, and &s;ufficient to furni&s;h their trade, without laying them under great difficulties. Intolerant as they are of the mo&s;t u&s;eful re&s;traints, their commerce flouri&s;hes from the freedom every man has of pur&s;uing it according to his own ideas, and directing his life after his own fa&s;hion.</P>

This people have a country, where more is to be effected by managing the people than by cultivating the ground; where a pedling commerce, that requires con&s;tant motion, flouri&s;hes more than agriculture or a regular traffic; where they have difficulties which keep them alert by &s;truggling with them, and where their obedience to a wi&s;e government &s;erves them for per&s;onal wi&s;dom.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Engli&s;h colonies are the faire&s;t objects of our attention in Ame|rica, not only as they comprehend a va&s;t and delightful variety of climates, &s;itua|tions, natural products and effects of art; but as they contain, though the dominions of one potentate, and their inhabitants formed out of the people of one nation, an almo&s;t equal variety of manners, religions and ways of living. They have a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing trade with their mother country, and they commu|nicate widely with many foreign nations; for be&s;ides the con&s;tant and u&s;eful intercour&s;e they hold with Africa, their &s;hips are &s;een in the ports of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and even in the Levant; nor are they excluded the American &s;ettlements of France, Spain, Portugal and
<PB N="58" REF="60">
Holland. This, with their con&s;tant corre&s;pon|dence with each other, and with their mo|ther country, hurries about a lively circula|tion of trade, of which Great Britain is the heart and &s;pring, from whence it takes it's ri&s;e, and to which it all returns in the end.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the European &s;ettlements we have &s;een the effects of a va&s;t ambition &s;up|ported by &s;urprizing feats of a romantic cou|rage mixed with an in&s;atiable thir&s;t of gold. In others, the regular product of a &s;y&s;tematic policy tempering and guiding an active indu&s;|try; but in our own colonies we are to di&s;play the effects of liberty; the work of a people guided by their own genius, and following the directions of their own natural temper in a proper path.</P>
<P>I intend to con&s;ider the Engli&s;h colonies un|der two principal divi&s;ions; the fir&s;t I allot to tho&s;e i&s;lands which lie under the torrid zone between the tropic of Cancer and the Equinoc|tial line, in that part generally called the We&s;t-Indies. The &s;econd is to comprehend ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the temperate zone on the con+tinent of North America. The We&s;t-Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> i&s;lands &s;hall be con&s;idered, as they are among&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the greater Antilles; the Windward, or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Leeward i&s;lands. Among&s;t the fir&s;t we po&s;+&s;e&s;s the large and noble i&s;land of Jamai+ca; among&s;t the &s;econd we have Barba+does; and in the third divi&s;ion St. Chri&s;to+pher's,
<PB N="59" REF="61">
Antegua, Nevis, Mont&s;errat, and Bar|buda. As all the&s;e i&s;lands lie between the tropics, whatever is to be &s;aid of the air, winds, meteors, and natural produce, &s;hall fall under one head, as they are the &s;ame or near|ly the &s;ame in all of them; their produce for the market is nearly the &s;ame too; and there|fore whatever is to be &s;aid of the manufactur|ing of tho&s;e, &s;hall come together, after we have given a conci&s;e de&s;cription of the &s;tate of each i&s;land &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Jamaica lies between the 75th and 79th degree of We&s;t longitude from London, and is between &s;eventeen and nineteen degrees di&s;tant from the Equinoctial. It is in length, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, a hundred and forty Engli&s;h miles; and in breadth about &s;ixty; and of an oval form. This country is in a manner inter&s;ected with a ridge of lofty mountains, rugged and rocky, that are called the blue mountains. On each &s;ide of the blue moun|tains are chains of le&s;&s;er mountains gradually lower. The greater mountains are little better than &s;o many rocks; where there is any earth, it is only a &s;tubborn clay fit for no &s;ort of hu&s;|bandry. The mountains are very &s;teep, and the rocks tumbled upon one another in a man|ner altogether &s;tupendous, the effect of the frequent earthquakes which have &s;haken this i&s;land in all times. Yet barren as the&s;e moun|tains are, they are all covered to the very top
<PB N="60" REF="62">
with a great variety of beautiful trees, flouri&s;h|ing in a perpetual &s;pring; their roots pene|trate the crannies of the rocks, and &s;earch out the moi&s;ture which is lodged there by the rains that fall &s;o frequently on the&s;e moun|tains, and the mi&s;ts that almo&s;t perpetually brood upon them. The&s;e rocks too are the parents of a va&s;t number of fine rivulets, which tumble down their &s;ides in cataracts, that form among&s;t the rudene&s;s of the rocks and pre|cipices, and the &s;hining verdure of the trees, the mo&s;t wildly plea&s;ing imagery imaginable. The face of this country is a good deal diffe|rent from what is generally ob&s;erved in other places. For as on one hand the mountains are very &s;teep; &s;o the plains between them are perfectly &s;mooth and level. In the&s;e plains, the &s;oil augmented by the wa&s;h of the mountains for &s;o many ages, is prodigiou&s;ly fertile. None of our i&s;lands produce &s;o fine &s;ugars. They formerly had here cacao in great perfection, which delights in a rich ground. Their pa&s;tures after the rains, are of a mo&s;t beautiful verdure, and extraordinary fatne&s;s. They are called Savannas. On the whole, if this i&s;land were not troubled with great thunders and lightnings, hurricanes, and earthquakes; and if the air was not at once violently hot, damp, and extremely unwhol|&s;ome in mo&s;t parts, the fertility and beauty of this country would make it as de&s;irable a
<PB N="61" REF="63">
&s;ituation for plea&s;ure, as it is for the profits, which in &s;pite of the&s;e di&s;advantages draw hither &s;uch a number of people.</P>
<P>The river waters are many of them un|whol&s;ome, and ta&s;te of copper; but &s;ome &s;prings there are of a better kind. In the plains are found &s;everal &s;alt fountains, and in the mountains, not far from Spani&s;h-town, is a hot bath, of extraordinary medicinal virtues. It relieves in the dry belly-ach, one of the mo&s;t terrible endemial di&s;tempers of Jamaica, and in various other complaints.</P>
<P>This i&s;land came into our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during the u&s;urpation of Cromwell, and by means of an armament which had another de&s;tination. Cromwell, notwith&s;tanding the great abilities which enabled him to overturn the con&s;ti|tution, and to trample upon the liberties of his country, was not &s;ufficiently acquainted with foreign politics. This ignorance made him connect him&s;elf clo&s;ely with France, then ri&s;ing into a dangerous grandeur, and to fight with great animo&s;ity, the &s;hadow which re|mained of the Spani&s;h power. On &s;uch ideas he fitted out a formidable fleet, with a view to reduce the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola; and though he failed in this de&s;ign, Jamaica made amends not only for this failure, but al|mo&s;t for the ill policy which fir&s;t drew him into ho&s;tilities with the Spaniards; by which,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
however, he added this excellent country to the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>There was nothing of the genius of Crom|well to be &s;een in the planning of this expedi|tion. From the fir&s;t to the la&s;t all was wrong; all was a chain of little intere&s;ted mi&s;management, and had no air of the re&s;ult of ab&s;olute power lodged in great hands. The fleet was ill victualled; the troops ill provided with nece&s;&s;aries to &s;upport and encourage men badly cho&s;en, and wor&s;e armed. They em|barked in great di&s;content. The generals were but little better &s;atisfied, and had little more hopes than the &s;oldiers. But the gene|rals, (for there were two in the command, Pen and Venables, one for the marine, the other for the land &s;ervice,) were men of no ex|traordinary talents. And if they had been men of the be&s;t capacity, little was to be expected from two commanders not &s;ubordinate, and &s;o differing in their ideas, and &s;o envious of each other as land and &s;ea-officers generally are. But to make this arrangement perfect in all re&s;pects, and to improve the advantages ari&s;ing from a divided command, they added a number of commi&s;&s;ioners as a check upon both. This tripartite general&s;hip, in the tru|e&s;t Dutch ta&s;te, produced the effects that might be expected from it. The &s;oldiers dif|fered with the generals, the generals di&s;a|greed with one another, and all quarrelled
<PB N="63" REF="65">
with the commi&s;&s;ioners. The place of their landing in Hi&s;paniola was ill cho&s;en, and the manner of it wretchedly contrived. The ar|my had forty miles to march before it could act; and the &s;oldiers, without order, without heart, fainting and dying by the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the climate and the want of nece&s;&s;ary pro|vi&s;ions, and di&s;heartened yet more by the cowar|dice and di&s;content of their officers, yielded an ea&s;y victory to an handful of Spaniards. They retired ignominiou&s;ly and with great lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But the principal commanders, a little recon|ciled by their misfortunes, and fearing to re|turn to England without effect, very wi&s;ely turned their thoughts another way. They re&s;olved to attempt Jamaica, before the inha|bitants of that i&s;land could receive encourage|ment by the news of their defeat in Hi&s;paniola. They knew that this i&s;land was in no good po&s;ture of defence; and they &s;et them&s;elves vigorou&s;ly to avoid the mi&s;takes, which prov|ed &s;o fatal in the former expedition. They &s;everely puni&s;hed the officers who had &s;hewn an ill example by their cowardice; and they ordered with re&s;pect to the &s;oldiers, that if any attempted to run away, the man neare&s;t to him &s;hould &s;hoot him.</P>
<P>Fortified with the&s;e regulations they landed in Jamaica, and laid &s;iege to St. Jago de la Vega now called Spani&s;h-town, the capital of the i&s;land. The people, who were in no
<PB N="64" REF="66">
condition to oppo&s;e an army of ten thou&s;and men, and a &s;trong naval force, would have &s;urrendered immediately, if they had not been encouraged by the &s;trange delays of our gene|rals and their commi&s;&s;ioners. However at la&s;t the town with the whole i&s;land &s;urren|dered, but not until the inhabitants had &s;ecreted their mo&s;t valuable effects in the mountains.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the re&s;toration, the Spaniards ceded the i&s;land to our court. Crom|well had &s;ettled there &s;ome of the troops em|ployed in it's reduction; &s;ome royali&s;ts unea&s;y at home &s;ought an a&s;ylum in this i&s;land; not a few planters from Barbadoes were invited to Jamaica by the extraordinary fertility of the &s;oil, and the other various advantages which it offered. The&s;e latter taught the for|mer &s;ettlers the manner of rai&s;ing the &s;ugar cane, and making &s;ugar. For at fir&s;t they had wholly applied them&s;elves to the rai&s;ing of cacao, as the Spaniards had done before them. It was happy for them that they fell into this new practice; for the cacao groves planted by the Spaniards began to fail, and the new plantations did not an&s;wer, as the negroes foretold they would not, becau&s;e of the want of certain religious ceremonies
<PB N="65" REF="67">
always u&s;ed by the Spaniards in planting them, at which none of the &s;laves were &s;uffered to be pre&s;ent, and to the u&s;e of which they at|tributed the pro&s;perity of the&s;e plantations. Probably there were methods taken at that time, that were covered by the veil of the&s;e religious ceremonies, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of that plant. However that be, the cacao has never &s;ince equalled the reputation of the Spani&s;h, but gave way to the more profitable cultivation of indigo and &s;ugar.</P>
<P>But what gave the greate&s;t life to this new &s;ettlement, and rai&s;ed it at once to a &s;urprizing pitch of opulence, which it hardly equals even in our days, was the re&s;ort thither of tho&s;e pirates called the Buccaneers. That people who fought with the mo&s;t de&s;perate bravery, and &s;pent their plunder with the mo&s;t &s;tupid extravagance, were very welcome gue&s;ts in Jamaica. They often brought two, three, and four hundred thou&s;and pieces of eight at a time, which were immediately &s;quandered a|way in all the ways of exce&s;&s;ive gaming, wine and women. Va&s;t fortunes were made, and the returns of trea&s;ure to England were prodi|giou&s;ly great. In the i&s;land they had by this means rai&s;ed &s;uch funds, that when the &s;ource of this wealth was &s;topped up by the
<PB N="66" REF="68">
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the pirates, they were enabled to turn their indu&s;try into better channels. They increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that it was computed that in the beginning of this century, they had &s;ixty thou&s;and whites and a hundred and twenty thou&s;and negroes in this i&s;land. This calcu|lation is certainly too large. However, the Jamaicans were undoubtedly very numerous until reduced by earthquakes, (one of which intirely ruined Port-Royal, and killed a va&s;t number of per&s;ons in all parts of the country) and by very terrible epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, which treading on the heels of the former calamities &s;wept away va&s;t multitudes. Lo&s;&s;es which have not been &s;ince &s;ufficiently repaired. Now the white inhabitants &s;carcely exceed twenty thou&s;and &s;ouls, and the blacks are about ninety thou&s;and; both much fewer than was computed formerly, and with a di&s;|proportion much greater on the &s;ide of the whites. It appears at pre&s;ent, that Jamaica is rather upon the decline; a point this that de&s;erves the mo&s;t attentive con&s;ideration. A country which contains at lea&s;t four millions of acres, has a fertile &s;oil, an exten&s;ive &s;ea coa&s;t, and many very fine harbours, for an i&s;land &s;o circum&s;tanced, and at a time when the value of all it's products at market is con&s;iderably ri&s;en, for &s;uch a country to fall &s;hort of it's
<PB N="67" REF="69">
former numbers, and not to have above three or four hundred thou&s;and acres employed in any &s;ort of culture, &s;hews clearly that &s;ome|thing mu&s;t be very wrong in the management of its affairs; and what &s;hews it even yet more clearly, land is &s;o extravagantly dear in many of the other i&s;lands, as to &s;ell &s;ometimes for one hundred pounds an acre and upwards; a price that undoubtedly never would be paid, if convenient land was to be had, and proper encouragement given in Jamaica. Whether this be owing to public or private faults, I know not; but certain it is, that wherever they are, they de&s;erve a &s;peedy and effectual remedy from tho&s;e, in who&s;e power it is to apply it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE natural products of Jamaica, be&s;ides &s;ugar, cacao, and ginger, are principally piemento, or, as it is called, all&s;pice, or Ja|maica pepper. The tree which bears the piemento ri&s;es to the height of above thirty feet. It is &s;traight, of a moderate thickne&s;s, and covered with a grey bark extremely &s;mooth and &s;hining. It &s;hoots out a va&s;t num|ber of branches upon all &s;ides, that bear a plentiful foliage of very large and beautiful leaves of a &s;hining green, in all things re&s;em|bling
<PB N="68" REF="70">
the leaf of the bay tree. At the very end of the twigs are formed bunches of flowers; each &s;talk bearing a flower which bends back, and within which bend are to be di&s;cerned &s;ome &s;tamina of a pale green co|lour; to the&s;e &s;ucceeds a bunch of &s;mall crowned berries, larger when ripe than juniper berries; at that &s;ea&s;on they change from their former green, and become black, &s;mooth, and &s;hining; they are taken unripe from the tree, and dried in the &s;un; in this ca&s;e they a&s;&s;ume a brown colour, and have a mixed flavour of many kinds of &s;pice, whence it is called all&s;pice. But it is milder than the other &s;pices, and is judged to be inferior to none of them for the &s;ervice which it does to cold, watery, and lan|guid &s;tomachs. The tree grows mo&s;tly upon the mountains.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they have the wild cinamon tree, who&s;e bark is &s;o &s;erviceable in medicine; the manchineel, a mo&s;t beautiful tree to the eye, with the faire&s;t apple in the world, and when cut down affording a very fine ornamen|tal wood for the joiners, but the apple, and the juice in every part of the tree, contain one of the wor&s;t poi&s;ons in nature. Here is the maho|gany too, in &s;uch general u&s;e with us; the cabbage tree, a tall plant, famous for a &s;ub&s;tance looking and ta&s;ting like cabbage, which grows on the very top, and which produces but one a year, and for the extreme hardne&s;s of it's
<PB N="69" REF="71">
wood, which when dry is incorruptible, and hardly yields to any tool; the palma, from which is drawn a great deal of oil, much e&s;teemed by the negroes both in food and medicine; the white wood, which never breeds the worm in &s;hips; the &s;oap tree, who&s;e berries an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of wa&s;hing; the mangrove and olive bark, u&s;eful to tan|ners; the fu&s;tic and redwood to the dyers, and lately the logwood; and their fore&s;ts &s;upply the apothecary with guaicum, &s;al&s;aparilla, china, ca&s;&s;ia, and tamarinds; they have aloes too; and do not want the cochineal plant, though they know nothing of the art of ma|naging it; nor perhaps is the climate &s;uitable. The indigo plant was formerly much cultiva|ted, and the cotton tree is &s;till &s;o, and they &s;end home more of it's wool than all the re&s;t of our i&s;lands together.</P>
<P>The whole product therefore of the i&s;land may be reduced to the&s;e heads. Fir&s;t, &s;ugars, of which they exported in 1753 twenty thou|&s;and three hundred and fifteen hog&s;heads, &s;ome va&s;tly great even to a tun weight, which cannot be worth le&s;s in England than 424,725 pounds &s;terling. Mo&s;t of this goes to London and Bri&s;tol, and &s;ome part of it to North America, in return for the beef, pork, chee&s;e, corn, pea&s;e, &s;taves, plank, pitch and tar, which they have from thence. 2. Rum, of which they export about 4000 pun|cheons.
<PB N="70" REF="72">
The rum of this i&s;land e&s;teemed the be&s;t, and is the mo&s;t generally u&s;ed in England. 3. Mola&s;&s;es, in which they make a great part of their returns for New England, where there are va&s;t di&s;tilleries. All the&s;e are the produce of their grand &s;taple the &s;ugar cane. 4. Cotton, of which they &s;end out 2000 bags. The indigo, formerly much cultivated, is now incon&s;iderable, but &s;ome cacoa and coffee are exported, which latter is in no great e&s;teem; though it is &s;aid to be little inferior to that of Mocha, provided it be kept for two or three years. With the&s;e they &s;end home a con|&s;iderable quantity of piemento, ginger, drugs for dyers, and apothecaries, &s;weetmeats, and mahogany and manchineel plank. But &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable articles of their trade are with the Spani&s;h continent of New Spain and Terra Firma; for in the former they cut great quantities of logwood, and both in the former and latter they drive a va&s;t and profit|able trade in negroes, and all kinds of the &s;ame European goods which are carried thi|ther from Old Spain by the flota.</P>
<P>Both the logwood trade and this counter|band have been the &s;ubjects of much conten|tion and the cau&s;e of a war between our's and the Spani&s;h nation. The former we avow, and we claim it as our right; though in the la&s;t treaty of peace, that point was far from being well &s;ettled. The latter we permit;
<PB N="71" REF="73">
becau&s;e we think, and very ju&s;tly, that if the Spaniards find them&s;elves aggrieved by any counterband trade, it lies upon them, and not upon us, to put a &s;top to it.</P>
<P>Formerly we cut logwood in the bay of Campeachy on the northern &s;ide of the penin|&s;ula of Jucatan. But the Spaniards have driven our people entirely from thence, and built forts and made &s;ettlements to prevent them from returning. Expelled from thence, the logwood cutters &s;ettled upon the gulph of Honduras on the &s;outhern &s;ide of the &s;ame penin&s;ula, where they are in &s;ome &s;ort e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and have a &s;ort to protect them. They are an odd kind of people, compo&s;ed mo&s;tly of vagabonds and fugitives from all parts of North America, and their way of life is &s;uit|able. They live pretty much in a lawle&s;s manner, though they elect one among&s;t them whom they call their king; and to him they pay as much obedience as they think fit. The country they are in is low, and extreme|ly mar&s;hy; the air is prodigiou&s;ly mole&s;ted with mu&s;kettoes; and the water dangerous with alligators; yet a life of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, a plenty of brandy, large gains, and a want of thought, have perfectly reconciled them to the hard&s;hips of their employment, and the unwhol&s;omene&s;s of the climate. They go always well armed, and are about one thou|&s;and five hundred men.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74">In the dry &s;ea&s;on, when they cut the log|wood, they advance a con&s;iderable way into the country, following the logwood, which runs among&s;t the other trees of the fore&s;t, like the vein of a mineral in the earth. When the rains have overflowed the whole country, they have marks by which they know where the logwood is depo&s;ited. This is an heavy wood, and &s;inks in the water. However, it is ea&s;ily buoyed up, and one diver can lift very large beams. The&s;e they carry by the favour of the land-floods into the river, to a place which is called the Barcaderas or Port, where they meet the &s;hips that come upon this trade.</P>
<P>In the year 1716, when the debate concern|ing this matter was revived; the lords of trade reported, that before the year 1676 we had a number of people &s;ettled and carrying on this trade on the penin&s;ula of Jucatan; that we always con&s;idered this as our right, and were &s;upported in it by our kings; and that this right was confirmed, if it had want|ed any confirmation, by a clau&s;e of <HI>uti po&s;&s;i|detis,</HI> in the treaty of peace which was con|cluded with Spain and the court of London in 1676, and that we certainly were in full po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;ettlements and that trade, long before the time of that treaty; and further, that the Spaniards them&s;elves have incidentally drawn a great advantage from it; &s;ince the pirates, who were formerly the mo&s;t re&s;olved
<PB N="73" REF="75">
and effectual enemies they ever had, were the more ea&s;ily re&s;trained from their enter|pri&s;es, by having their minds diverted to this employment. Upon the whole, they conclud|ed it an affair very well worth the attention of the government, as in &s;ome years it em|ployed near &s;ix thou&s;and tuns of &s;hipping; found employment for a number of &s;eamen proportionable; con&s;umed a good deal of our manufactures, and was of con&s;iderable u&s;e in fabricating many others; and that the whole value of the returns were not le&s;s than &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year. Notwith|&s;tanding this, our claim &s;eems dropped, nor is it very clear how far it can be maintained, to carry on a trade by violence in a country, in which we can hardly claim, according to the common ideas of right in America, any property. However this may be, the trade, though with many difficulties and di&s;courage|ments, &s;till continues, and will probably con|tinue whil&s;t the Spaniards are &s;o weak upon that &s;ide of Mexico, and while the coa&s;t continues &s;o di&s;agreeable, that none but de&s;pe|rate per&s;ons will venture to re&s;ide there. The logwood trade is generally carried on by New England ve&s;&s;els, who take the goods they want in Jamaica.</P>
<P>But there is a trade yet more profitable carried on between this i&s;land and the Spani&s;h continent, e&s;pecially in time of war. This too
<PB N="74" REF="76">
has been the cau&s;e of much bickering between us and the court of Spain, and it will yet be more difficult for them to put a &s;top to this trade than to the former, whil&s;t the Spaniards are &s;o eager for it, whil&s;t it is &s;o profitable to the Briti&s;h merchant, and whil&s;t the Spani&s;h officers from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t &s;hew &s;o great a re&s;pect to pre&s;ents pro|perly made. The trade is carried on in this manner. The &s;hip from Jamaica having taken in negroes, and a proper &s;ortment of goods there, proceeds in time of peace to a harbour called the Grout within Monkey-key, about four miles from Portobello. A per&s;on who under&s;tands Spani&s;h, is directly &s;ent a&s;hore to give the merchants of the town no|tice of the arrival of the ve&s;&s;el; the &s;ame news is carried likewi&s;e with great &s;peed to Panama; from whence the merchants &s;et out di&s;gui&s;ed like pea&s;ants with their &s;ilver in jars covered with meal, to deceive the officers of the revenue. Here the &s;hip remains trading frequently for five or &s;ix weeks together. The Spaniards u&s;ually come on board, leave their money, and take their negroes, and their goods packed up in parcels fit for one man to carry, after having been hand&s;omely entertained on board, and receiving provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for their journey homeward. If the whole cargo is not di&s;po&s;ed of here, they bear off ea&s;tward to the Brew, a harbour about five miles di&s;tant
<PB N="75" REF="77">
from Carthagena, where they &s;oon find a vent for the re&s;t. There is no trade more profitable than this; for your payments are made in ready money; and the goods &s;ell higher than they would at any other market. It is not on this coa&s;t only, but every where upon the Spani&s;h main, that this trade is carried on; nor is it by the Engli&s;h only, but the French from Hi&s;paniola, the Dutch from Cura&s;&s;ou, and even the Danes have &s;ome &s;hare in it. When the Spani&s;h guarda co&s;tas &s;eize upon one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, they make no &s;cruple of confi&s;|cating the cargo, and of treating the crew in a manner little better than pirates.</P>
<P>This commerce in time of peace, and this with the prizes that are made in time of war, pour into Jamaica an a&s;toni&s;hing quantity of trea&s;ure; great fortunes are made in a manner in&s;tantly, whil&s;t the people appear to live in &s;uch a &s;tate of luxury as in all other places leads to beggary. Their equipages, their cloaths, their furniture, their tables, all bear the tokens of the greate&s;t wealth and profu&s;ion imaginable; this obliges all the trea&s;ure they receive, to make but a very &s;hort &s;tay, as all this trea&s;ure added to all the products of the i&s;land it&s;elf, is hardly more than &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the calls of their nece&s;&s;ity and luxury on Europe and North America, and their demand for &s;laves, of which this i&s;land is under the nece&s;|&s;ity of an annual recruit for it's own u&s;e and
<PB N="76" REF="78">
that of the Spani&s;h trade, of upwards of &s;ix thou&s;and head, and which &s;tand them one with another in thirty pounds apiece, and often more.</P>

<P>THE whole i&s;land is divided into nine|teen di&s;tricts or pari&s;hes, which &s;end each of them two members to the a&s;&s;embly, and allow a competent maintenance to a mi|ni&s;ter. Port-Royal was anciently the capital of the i&s;land; it &s;tood upon the very point of a long narrow neck of land, which towards the &s;ea formed part of the border of a very noble harbour of it's own name. In this har|bour above a thou&s;and &s;ail of the large&s;t &s;hips could anchor with the greate&s;t convenience and &s;afety; and the water was &s;o deep at the key of Port-Royal, that ve&s;&s;els of the greate&s;t burthen could lay their broad&s;ides to the wharfs, and load and unload at little expence or trouble. This conveniency weighed &s;o much with the inhabitants, that they cho&s;e in this &s;pot to build their capital, though the place was an hot dry &s;and, which produced not one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, no not even fre&s;h water. However, this advantageous &s;ituation, and the re&s;ort of the pirates, &s;oon made it a very con&s;iderable place. It contained two thou&s;and hou&s;es, very hand&s;omely built, and
<PB N="77" REF="79">
which rented as high as tho&s;e in London. It had a re&s;ort like a con&s;tant fair, by the great concour&s;e of people of bu&s;ine&s;s, and grew to all this in about thirty years time; for before that there was &s;carcely an hou&s;e upon the place. In &s;hort, there were very few parts of the world, which for the &s;ize could be compared to this town for trade, wealth, and an entire corruption of manners.</P>
<P>It continued thus until the 9th of June 1692, when an earthquake, which &s;hook the whole i&s;land to it's foundations, overwhelmed this city, and buried nine tenths of it eight fathom under water. This earthquake not only de|moli&s;hed this city, but made a terrible deva&s;|tation all over the i&s;land, and was followed by a contagious di&s;temper, which was near giving the la&s;t hand to it's ruin. Ever &s;ince, it is re|marked, that the air is far more unwhol&s;ome than formerly. This earthquake, one of the mo&s;t dreadful that I think ever was known, is de&s;cribed in &s;uch lively colours in the Phi|lo&s;ophical tran&s;actions, and by per&s;ons who &s;aw and had a large part in the terrors and lo&s;&s;es of this calamity, that I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of it, but refer thither; as I am certain no man from his fancy, could a&s;&s;emble a greater number of images of horror, than the nature of things, taught the per&s;ons who &s;aw them, to bring to|gether, and which are there related very na|turally and pathetically.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80">They rebuilt this city after the earthquake, but it was again de&s;troyed. A terrible fire laid it in a&s;hes about ten years after. Not|with&s;tanding this, the extraordinary conve|nience of the harbour tempted them to re|build it again. But in the year 1722 a hur|ricane, one of the mo&s;t terrible on record, reduced it a third time to a heap of rub|bi&s;h. Warned by the&s;e extraordinary cala|mities, that &s;eemed to mark out this place as a devoted &s;pot, an act of a&s;&s;embly removed the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and publick offices from thence, and forbid that any market &s;hould be held there for the future. The principal inha|bitants came to re&s;ide at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the bay, at a place which is called King|&s;ton. This town is commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for fre&s;h water, and all manner of accommoda|tions. The &s;treets are of a commodious widene&s;s, regularly drawn, and cutting each other at equal di&s;tances and right angles. It con&s;i&s;ts of upwards of one thou&s;and hou&s;es, many of them hand&s;omely built, though low, with porticoes, and every conveniency for a comfortable habitation in that climate. The harbour was formerly in no good po&s;ture of defence, but by the care of the late governor Mr. Knowles, it is now &s;trongly fortified.</P>
<P>The river Cobre, a con&s;iderable, but not navi|gable &s;tream, falls into the &s;ea not far from King&s;ton. Upon the banks of this river &s;tands
<PB N="79" REF="81">
St. Jago de la Vega, or Spani&s;h-town; the &s;eat of government, and the place where the courts of ju&s;tice are held, and con&s;equently the capital of Jamaica, though inferior in &s;ize and re&s;ort to King&s;ton. However, this, tho' a town of le&s;s bu&s;ine&s;s, has more gaiety. Here re&s;ide many per&s;ons of large fortunes, and who make a figure proportionable; the num|ber of coaches kept here is very great; here is a regular a&s;&s;embly; and the re&s;idence of the governor and the principal officers of the go|vernment, who have all very profitable places, con&s;pire with the genius of the inhabitants, o&s;tentatious and expen&s;ive, to make it a very &s;plendid and agreeable place. Mr. Knowles, the late governor, made an attempt to remove the &s;eat of government from hence to King&s;ton, for rea&s;ons which, it mu&s;t be owned, have a very plau&s;ible appearance; for it would cer|tainly facilitate the carrying on of bu&s;ine&s;s, to have the courts of ju&s;tice and the &s;eat of government as near as po&s;&s;ible to the center of commercial affairs. But whether the con|&s;ideration of a more healthful &s;ituation; the divi&s;ion of the advantages of great towns with the &s;everal parts of the country, and the mi&s;|chiefs that might ari&s;e from &s;haking the &s;ettled order of things, and prejudicing the property of a great many private people, can weigh again&s;t the advantages propo&s;ed by this re|moval, I will not undertake to determine.
<PB N="80" REF="82">
One thing appears I think very plainly in the conte&s;t which this regulation produced; that the oppo&s;ition was at lea&s;t as much to the governor as to the mea&s;ure; and that great natural warmth of temper upon all &s;ides, en|flamed and envenomed by a &s;pirit of party which reigns in all our plantations, kindled a flame about this, which, if it had not hap|pened, mu&s;t have ri&s;en to the &s;ame height upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion, &s;ince there was a plenty of combu&s;tible materials ready upon all &s;ides.</P>
<P>The government of this i&s;land is, next to that of Ireland, the be&s;t in the king's gift. The &s;tanding &s;alary is two thou&s;and five hundred pounds a year. The a&s;&s;embly vote the governor as much more; and this, with the other great profits of his office, make it in the whole little inferior to ten thou&s;and pounds a year. But of the government I &s;hall &s;ay little, until I &s;peak of the government of the re&s;t of the plantations, to which this is in all re&s;pects alike.</P>

<P>THE next i&s;land, in point of impor|tance, which we po&s;&s;e&s;s in the We&s;t-Indies, but the olde&s;t in point of &s;ettlement, is Barbadoes. This is one, and by no means the mo&s;t contemptible one among&s;t the Wind|ward divi&s;ion of the Caribbee i&s;lands. It is not di&s;tinctly known when this i&s;land was fir&s;t di&s;covered or &s;ettled; but it was probably &s;ome time about the year 1625.</P>
<P>When the Engli&s;h fir&s;t landed here, they found the place the mo&s;t &s;avage and de&s;titute that can be well imagined. It had not the lea&s;t appearance of ever having been peopled even by &s;avages. There was no kind of bea&s;t of pa&s;ture or of prey, no fruit, nor herb, nor root fit for &s;upporting the life of man. Yet as the climate was good, and the &s;oil appeared fertile, &s;ome gentlemen of &s;mall fortunes in England re&s;olved to become adventurers thither. But the fir&s;t planters had not only the utter de&s;olatene&s;s of the place, and the ex|treme want of provi&s;ions to &s;truggle with, but the trees were &s;o large, of a wood &s;o hard and &s;tubborn, and full of &s;uch great branches, that they proceeded in the clearing of the ground with a difficulty that mu&s;t have worn down
<PB N="82" REF="84">
any ordinary patience. And even when they had tolerably cleared &s;ome little &s;pot, the fir&s;t produce it yielded for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was &s;o &s;mall and ordinary, at the &s;ame time that their &s;upplies from England were &s;o &s;low and precarious, that nothing but the noble&s;t cou|rage, and a firmne&s;s which cannot receive too many prai&s;es, could have carried them through the di&s;couragements which they met in the noble&s;t work in the world, the cultivating and peopling a de&s;erted part of the globe. But by degrees things were mollified; &s;ome of the trees yielded fu&s;tic for the dyers, cotton and indigo agreed well with the &s;oil; to|bacco then becoming fa&s;hionable in England an&s;wered tolerably; and the country began gradually to lay a&s;ide all it's &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition, and to &s;ubmit to culture.</P>
<P>The&s;e good appearances in America, and the &s;torm which &s;ome time after began to gather in England, encouraged many to go over; but &s;till the colony received no &s;ort of encouragement from the government, which at that time under&s;tood the advantages of co|lonies but little; and which was be&s;ides much wor&s;e occupied in &s;owing tho&s;e &s;eeds of bitter|ne&s;s, which came afterwards &s;o terribly to their own lips. The court took no other notice of this i&s;land than to grant it to a very unworthy and unfaithful favourite, the earl of Carli&s;le;
<PB N="83" REF="85">
which, as may be judged, proved of no ad|vantage to the &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>However, as this colony had the hardie&s;t breeding, and the mo&s;t laborious infancy of any of our &s;ettlements, &s;o it was far &s;tronger in it's &s;tamina, and grew with greater &s;peed; and that to an height, which if it were not proved beyond any rea&s;onable doubt, could &s;carcely be believed. For in this &s;mall i&s;land, which is but twenty-five miles in length, and in breadth but fourteen, in little more than twenty years after it's fir&s;t &s;ettlement, that is, in 1650, it contained upwards of fifty thou&s;and whites of all &s;exes and ages, and a much greater number of blacks and Indian &s;laves. The former of which &s;laves they bought; the latter they ac|quired by means not at all to their honour; for they &s;eized upon tho&s;e unhappy men without any pretence, in the neighbouring i&s;lands, and carried them into &s;lavery. A practice which has rendered the Caribbee Indians irrecon|cileable to us ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>This &s;mall i&s;land, peopled by upwards of one hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls, was not yet above half of it cultivated, nor was the indu&s;try of the inhabitants at a &s;tand. A little before the period I have mentioned, they learned the method of making &s;ugar; and this enlarging the &s;phere of their trade, they grew prodigiou&s;ly rich and numerous.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86">About this time the government in Eng|land, which was then in the hands of Crom|well, confined the trade of Barbadoes to the mother country, that before was managed al|together by the Dutch; at the &s;ame time that by the rigour which was exerci&s;ed to|wards the royal party, a great many gentlemen of very good families &s;ettled in this i&s;land, which was far from being peopled like &s;ome other colonies, by fugitives and men de&s;perate at home. After the re&s;toration it continued &s;till to advance by very ha&s;ty &s;trides. At that time king Charles created thirteen baronets from the gentlemen of this i&s;land, &s;ome of whom were worth ten thou&s;and pounds a year, and none &s;o little as one thou&s;and.</P>
<P>In 1676, which was the meridian of this &s;ettlement, their whites were computed to be &s;till much about fifty thou&s;and, but their ne|groe &s;laves were increa&s;ed &s;o as to be upwards of one hundred thou&s;and of all kinds. They employed four hundred &s;ail of &s;hips, one with another of an hundred and fifty tuns, in their trade, and their annual exported produce in &s;u|gar, indigo, ginger, cotton, &amp;c. amounted to up|wards of three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, and their circulating ca&s;h at home was two hundred thou&s;and pounds It is pro|bable that Holland it&s;elf, or perhaps even the be&s;t inhabited parts of China were never peopled to the &s;ame proportion, nor have they land of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, which pro|duces
<PB N="85" REF="87">
any thing like the &s;ame profits, except|ing the land upon which great cities are built. But &s;ince that time the i&s;land has been much upon the decline. The growth of the French &s;ugar i&s;lands, and the &s;ettlement of Antegua, St. Chri&s;topher's, Nevis, and Mont|&s;errat, as well as the greater e&s;tabli&s;hment in Jamaica, have drawn away from time to time a va&s;t number of their people. A terrible contagion, &s;aid to be brought over by the troops from England, but more probably de|rived from the coa&s;t of Africa, attacked the i&s;land in the year 1692; it raged like a pe&s;ti|lence; twenty have died in a day in their principal town; and all parts of the i&s;land &s;uf|fered in proportion. This &s;ickne&s;s continued, with &s;ome abatements, for &s;everal years, and left an ill di&s;po&s;ition in the climate ever after|wards. War raged at the &s;ame time with this di&s;temper; and the Barbadians who rai&s;ed a good number of men, lo&s;t many of them in fruitle&s;s expeditions again&s;t the French i&s;lands. The land too began not to yield quite &s;o kindly as it formerly had done, and in &s;ome places they were obliged to manure it. All the&s;e cau&s;es contributed to reduce the numbers and opulence of this celebrated i&s;land. But it is only in compari&s;on of it&s;elf, that it may be con&s;idered in any other than the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing condition even at this day; for at this day it contains twenty-five thou&s;and whites, very near
<PB N="86" REF="88">
eighty thou&s;and negroes, and it &s;hips above twenty-five thou&s;and hog&s;heads of &s;ugar, to the value of three hundred thou&s;and pounds, be&s;ides rum, mola&s;&s;es, cotton, ginger, and aloes; an immen&s;e peopling and produce for a country not containing more than one hundred acres thou&s;and of land; &s;o that by the ri&s;e of &s;u|gars, the returns of this i&s;land are little le&s;s than they were in it's mo&s;t flouri&s;hing times.</P>
<P>This i&s;land can rai&s;e near five thou&s;and men of it's own militia, and it has generally a regiment of regular troops, though not very compleat. It is fortified by nature all along the windward &s;hore by the rocks and &s;hoals, &s;o as to be near two thirds utterly inacce&s;&s;ible. On the leeward &s;ide it has good harbours; but the whole coa&s;t is protected by a good line of &s;everal miles in length, and &s;everal forts to defend it at the mo&s;t material places.</P>
<P>They &s;upport their own e&s;tabli&s;hment, which is very con&s;iderable, with great credit. The governor's place is worth at lea&s;t five thou|&s;and pounds a year, and the re&s;t of their officers have very valuable places. They provide very hand&s;omely for their clergy, who are of the church of England, which is the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed here, as it is in the other i&s;lands. But here are very few di&s;&s;enters. There is in general an appearance of &s;omething more of order and decency, and of a &s;ettled people, than in any other colony in the We&s;t-Indies.
<PB N="87" REF="89">
They have here a college, founded and well endowed by the virtue and liberality of that great man colonel Chri&s;topher Cod|rington, who was a native of this i&s;land, and who for a great number of amiable and u&s;e|ful qualities both in public and private life, for his courage, and his zeal for the good of his country, his humanity, his knowledge and love of literature, was far the riche&s;t producti|on and mo&s;t &s;hining ornament this i&s;land ever had.</P>
<P>This college does not &s;o fully an&s;wer the intentions of the excellent founder, as it might do. If the fund was applied to the educa|tion of a number of catechi&s;ts for the in&s;tructi|on of the negroes, &s;ome of them of their own colour, it would be a va&s;t public advantage, be&s;ides the charity, or perhaps the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of &s;ome &s;uch work.</P>
<P>This college is in Bridge-town, the capi|tal of the i&s;land, which before the late fire contained about twelve hundred hou&s;es, very hand&s;omely built, and inhabited by a numer|ous and wealthy people. The country of Barbadoes has a mo&s;t beautiful appearance, &s;welling here and there into gentle hills; &s;hin|ning by the cultivation of every part, by the verdure of the &s;ugar canes, the bloom and fra|grance of the number of orange, lemon, lime, and citron trees, the guavas, papas, aloes, and a va&s;t multitude of other elegant and u&s;eful
<PB N="88" REF="90">
plants, which ri&s;e intermix'd with the hou&s;es of the planters which are &s;own thickly on every part of the i&s;land. Even the negroe huts, though mean, contribute to the beauty of the country, for they &s;hade them with plantain trees, which give their villages the appearance of &s;o many beautiful groves. In &s;hort, there is no place in the We&s;t-Indies comparable to Barbadoes, in point of numbers of people, cultivation of the &s;oil, and tho&s;e elegancies and conveniencies which re&s;ult from both.</P>

<P>THE i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's is the chief of tho&s;e which we po&s;&s;e&s;s among&s;t the Leeward i&s;lands. It was fir&s;t &s;ettled by the French and Engli&s;h in the year 1626, but after various fortunes it was entirely ceded to us by the treaty of Utrecht. This i&s;land is about &s;eventy-five miles in compa&s;s. The circuit of Antegua is but little inferior. Nevis and Mont&s;errat are the &s;malle&s;t of the four, not exceeding for either of them, about eighteen or twenty miles in circumference. The &s;oil in all the&s;e i&s;lands is pretty much alike; light and &s;andy, but notwith&s;tanding fertile in an high degree. Antegua has no ri|vulets
<PB N="89" REF="91">
of fre&s;h water, and but very few &s;prings; this made it be deemed uninhabitable for a long time; but now they &s;ave the rains in ponds and ci&s;terns with great care, and they are rarely in great di&s;tre&s;s for water. The i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's makes the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ugars of any; but neither that, nor any of the Leeward i&s;lands, yields any other commodity of con&s;equence but what is derived from the cane, except Mont&s;errat, which exports &s;ome indigo, but of a very inferior kind. It is judged that the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's contains about nine thou&s;and whites, and twenty-five thou&s;and negroes; that Antegua has about &s;even thou|&s;and of the former colour, and twenty thou&s;and blacks; and that Nevis and Mont&s;errat may have each about five thou&s;and Europeans, who are the ma&s;ters of ten or twelve thou&s;and Afri|can &s;laves. So that the whole of the Leeward i&s;lands may be reckoned without exaggeration to maintain about twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and Engli&s;h, of whom every &s;ingle man gives bread to &s;e|veral in England, which is effected by the labour of near &s;eventy thou&s;and negroes. Their &s;ugar is proportionable, certainly not le&s;s than twenty-five thou&s;and hog&s;heads annually. Of the i&s;land of Barbuda, I &s;ay little, becau&s;e it has no direct trade with England. It is em|ployed in hu&s;bandry, and rai&s;ing fre&s;h provi|&s;ions for the u&s;e of the neighbouring colonies. It is the property of the Codrington family.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE climate in all our We&s;t-India i&s;lands is nearly the &s;ame, allowing for tho&s;e accidental differences, which the &s;everal &s;ituations, and qualities of the lands them&s;elves produce. As they lie within the tropic, and that the &s;un goes quite over their heads, and pa&s;&s;es beyond them to the North, and never retires further from any of them than about 30 degrees to the South, they are continually &s;ub|jected to the extreme of an heat, which would be intolerable, if the trade wind ri&s;ing gra|dually as the &s;un gathers &s;trength, did not blow in upon them from the &s;ea, and refre&s;h the air in &s;uch a manner as to enable them to attend their concerns even under the meridian &s;un. On the other hand, as the night advan|ces, a breeze begins to be perceived, which blows &s;martly from the land, as if it were
<PB N="91" REF="93">
from it's center, towards the &s;ea, to all points of the compa&s;s at once.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame remarkable providence in the di&s;po&s;ing of things it is, that when the &s;un has made a great progre&s;s towards the tropic of Cancer, and becomes in a manner vertical, he draws after him &s;uch a va&s;t body of clouds, as &s;hield them from his direct beams, and di&s;&s;olving into rain cool the air, and refre&s;h the country, thir&s;ty with the long drought, which commonly reigns from the beginning of Janu|ary to the latter end of May.</P>
<P>The rains in the We&s;t-Indies are by no means the things they are with us. Our heavie&s;t rains are but dews comparatively. They are rather floods of water poured from the clouds, with a prodigious impetuo&s;ity; the rivers ri&s;e in a moment; new rivers and lakes are formed, and in a &s;hort time all the low country is under water. Hence it is, that the rivers which have their &s;ources within the tropics, &s;well and overflow their banks at a certain &s;ea&s;on; and &s;o mi&s;taken were the an|cients in their idea of the torrid zone, which they imagined to be dried and &s;corched up with a continual and fervent heat, and for that rea&s;on uninhabitable, when in reality &s;ome of the large&s;t rivers in the world have their cour&s;e within it's limits, and the moi&s;ture is one of the greate&s;t inconveniences of the cli|mate in &s;everal places.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94">The rains make the only di&s;tinction of &s;ea|&s;ons in the We&s;t-Indies; the trees are green the whole year round; they have no cold, no fro&s;ts, no &s;nows, and but rarely &s;ome hail; the &s;torms of which are however very violent when they happen, and the hail&s;tones very great and heavy. Whether it be owing to this moi&s;ture alone, which alone does not &s;eem to be a &s;ufficient cau&s;e, or to a greater quantity of a &s;ulphurous acid, which predo|minates in the air in this country, metals of all kinds that are &s;ubject to the action of &s;uch cau&s;es, ru&s;t and canker in a very &s;hort time; and this cau&s;e, perhaps, as much as the heat it&s;elf, contributes to make the climate of the We&s;t-Indies unfriendly and unplea&s;ant to an European con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is in the rainy &s;ea&s;on (principally in the month of Augu&s;t, more rarely in July and September,) that they are a&s;&s;aulted by hurri|canes; the mo&s;t terrible calamity to which they are &s;ubject from the climate; this de|&s;troys at a &s;troke the labours of many years, and pro&s;trates the mo&s;t exalted hopes of the planter, and often ju&s;t at the moment when he thinks him&s;elf out of the reach of fortune. It is a &s;udden and violent &s;torm of wind, rain, thunder and lightning, attended with a furious &s;welling of the &s;eas, and &s;ometimes with an earthquake; in &s;hort, with every circum&s;tance which the elements can a&s;&s;emble, that is ter|rible
<PB N="93" REF="95">
and de&s;tructive. Fir&s;t, they &s;ee, as the prelude to the en&s;uing havock, whole fields of &s;ugar canes whirled into the air, and &s;cat|tered over the face of the country. The &s;tronge&s;t trees of the fore&s;t are torn up by the roots, and driven about like &s;tubble; their windmills are &s;wept away in a moment; their works, the fixtures, the ponderous copper boilers, and &s;tills of &s;everal hundred weight, are wrenched from the ground, and battered to pieces: their hou&s;es are no protection, the roofs are torn off at one bla&s;t; whil&s;t the rain, which in an hour ri&s;es five feet, ru&s;hes in upon them with an irre&s;i&s;tible violence.</P>
<P>There are &s;igns, which the Indians of the&s;e i&s;lands taught our planters, by which they can progno&s;ticate the approach of an hurricane. The hurricane comes on either in the quar|ters, or at the full change of the moon. If it comes at the full moon, when you are at the change ob&s;erve the&s;e &s;igns. That day you will &s;ee the &s;ky very turbulent; you will ob|&s;erve the &s;un more red than at other times; you will perceive a dead calm, and the hills clear of all tho&s;e clouds and mi&s;ts which u&s;ually hover about them. In the clefts of the earth, and in the wells, you hear a hollow rumbling &s;ound like the ru&s;hing of a great wind. At night the &s;tars &s;eem much larger than u&s;ual, and &s;urrounded with a &s;ort of burs; the North-We&s;t &s;ky has a black and
<PB N="94" REF="96">
menacing look; the &s;ea emits a &s;trong &s;mell, and ri&s;es into va&s;t waves, often without any wind; the wind it&s;elf now for&s;akes it's u&s;ual &s;teady Ea&s;terly &s;tream, and &s;hifts about to the We&s;t; from whence it &s;ometimes blows with intermi&s;&s;ions violently and irregularly for about two hours at a time. You have the &s;ame &s;igns at the full of the moon; the moon her&s;elf is &s;urrounded with a great bur, and &s;ometimes the &s;un has the &s;ame appearance. The&s;e progno&s;tics were taught by the Indians; and in general one may ob&s;erve, that ignorant country people and barbarous nations, are better ob&s;ervers of times and &s;ea&s;ons, and draw better rules from them, than more civilized and rea&s;oning people, for they rely more upon experience than theories, they are more care|ful of traditionary ob&s;ervations, and living more in the open air at all times, and not &s;o occupied but they have lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve every change, though minute, in that element, they come to have great trea&s;ures of u&s;eful matter, though, as it might be expected, mixed with many &s;uper&s;titious and idle notions as to the cau&s;es. The&s;e make their ob&s;ervations to be rejected as chimerical in the gro&s;s by many lite|rati, who are not near &s;o nice and circum&s;pect as they ought to be in di&s;tingui&s;hing what this &s;ort of people may be very competent judges of, and what not.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="97">The grand &s;taple commodity of the We&s;t-Indies is &s;ugar; this commodity was not at all known to the Greeks and Romans, though it was made in China in very early times, from whence we had the fir&s;t knowledge of it; but the Portugue&s;e were the fir&s;t who cultivated it in America, and brought it into reque&s;t as one of the materials of a very univer&s;al luxury in Europe. It is not &s;ettled whether the cane from which this &s;ub&s;tance is extracted, be a native of America or brought thither by the Portugue&s;e from India, and the coa&s;t of Afri|ca; but however the matter may be, in the beginning they made the mo&s;t as they &s;till do the be&s;t &s;ugars, which come to market in this part of the world. The &s;ugar cane grows to the height of between &s;ix and eight feet, full of joints, about four or five inches a&s;under; the colour of the body of the cane is yellowi&s;h, and the top, where it &s;hoots into leaves of a vivid green; the coat is pretty hard, and within contains a &s;pungy &s;ub&s;tance full of a juice, the mo&s;t lively, elegant, and lea&s;t cloying &s;weet in nature; and which &s;ucked raw, has proved extremely nutritive and whol&s;ome.</P>
<P>They are cultivated in this manner. In the month of Augu&s;t, that is, in the rainy part of the year, after the ground is cleared and well hoed, they lay a piece of &s;ix or &s;even joints of the cane, flat in a channel made for it, above half a foot deep; this they cover with the
<PB N="96" REF="98">
earth, and &s;o plant the whole field in lines re|gularly di&s;po&s;ed and at proper di&s;tances. In a &s;hort time a young cane &s;hoots out from every joint of the &s;tock which was interred, and grows in ten or twelve days to be a pret|ty tall and vigorous plant; but it is not until after &s;ixteen months, or thereabouts, that the canes are fit to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of the planter, though they may remain a few months after without any con&s;iderable preju|dice to him. The longer they remain in the the ground after they are come to maturity, the le&s;s juice they afford; but this is &s;ome|what compen&s;ated by the &s;uperior richne&s;s of the juice. That no time may be lo&s;t, they generally divide their cane grounds into three parts. One is of &s;tanding canes, and to be cut that &s;ea&s;on; the &s;econd is of new plant|ed canes; and the third is fallow, ready to receive a fre&s;h &s;upply. In &s;ome places they make &s;econd and third cuttings from the &s;ame root. The tops of the canes, and the leaves, which grow upon the joints, make very good provender for their cattle, and the refu&s;e of the cane after grinding, &s;erves for fire; &s;o that no part of this excellent plant is without it's u&s;e.</P>
<P>The canes are cut with a billet, and carried in bundles to the mill, which is now gene|rally a windmill; it turns three great cylinders or rollers plated with iron, &s;et perpendicular|ly
<PB N="97" REF="99">
and cogged &s;o as to be all moved by the middle roller. Between the&s;e, the canes are brui&s;ed to pieces, and the juice runs through an hole into a vat which is placed under the rollers to receive it; from hence it is carried through a pipe into a great re&s;ervoir, in which however, for fear of turning &s;our, it is not &s;uffered to re&s;t long, but is conveyed out of that by other pipes into the boiling hou&s;e, where it is received by a large cauldron: here it remains, until the &s;cum, which con&s;tantly ari&s;es during the boiling, is all taken off; from this, it is pa&s;&s;ed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into five or &s;ix more boilers, gradually dimini&s;hing in their &s;ize, and treated in the &s;ame manner. In the la&s;t of the&s;e it becomes of a very thick clammy con&s;i&s;tence; but mere boiling is incapable of carrying it farther: to advance the operation, they pour in a &s;mall quantity of lime-water; the immediate effect of this alien mixture, is to rai&s;e up the liquor in a very vehement fermentation; but to prevent it from running over, a bit of butter no larger than a nut is thrown in, upon which the fury of the fer|mentation immediately &s;ub&s;ides; a ve&s;&s;el of two or three hundred gallons requires no greater force to quiet it. It is now taken out and placed in a cooler, where it dries, granulates, and be|comes fit to be put into the pots, which is the la&s;t part of the operation.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100">The pots are conical, or of a &s;ugar-loaf fa&s;hi|on; open at the point, which mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as their bottom; here a &s;trainer is put acro&s;s. In the&s;e pots the &s;ugar purges it&s;elf of it's re|maining impurity; the mola&s;&s;es or treacly part di&s;entangles it&s;elf from the re&s;t, precipi|tates and runs out of the aperture at the bot|tom; it is now in the condition called mu&s;|cavado &s;ugar, of a yellowi&s;h brown colour, and thus it is generally put into the hog&s;head and &s;hipped off.</P>
<P>But when they have a mind to refine it yet further, and leave no remains at all of the mola&s;&s;es, they cover the pots I have ju&s;t mentioned with a &s;ort of white clay, like that u&s;ed for tobacco pipes, diluted with wa|ter; this penetrates the &s;ugar, unites with the mola&s;&s;es, and with them runs off; leaving the &s;ugar of a whiti&s;h colour, but white&s;t at top. This is called clayed &s;ugar; the operation is &s;ometimes repeated once or twice more, and the &s;ugar every time dimini&s;hing in quantity gains con&s;iderably in value; but &s;till is called clayed &s;ugar. Further than this they do not go in the plantations, becau&s;e an heavy duty of &s;ixteen &s;hillings per hundred weight is laid upon all &s;ugars refined there; it is therefore not to my purpo&s;e to carry the account any further.</P>
<P>Of the mola&s;&s;es rum is made, in a manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> that needs no de&s;cription, &s;ince it differs in
<PB N="99" REF="101">
nothing from the manner of di&s;tilling any other &s;pirit. From the &s;cummings of the &s;ugar, a meaner &s;pirit is procured. Rum finds its market in North America, (where it is con&s;umed by the Engli&s;h inhabitants, or em|ployed in the Indian trade, or di&s;tributed from thence to the fi&s;hery of Newfoundland, and the African commerce;) be&s;ides what comes to England and Ireland. However, a very great quantity of mola&s;&s;es is taken off raw and carried to New England to be di&s;tilled there.</P>
<P>They compute that when things are well managed, the rum and mola&s;&s;es pay the char|ges of the plantation, and that the &s;ugars are clear gain. However, by the particulars we have &s;een, and by others which we may ea&s;ily imagine, the expences of a plantation in the We&s;t-Indies are very great, and the profits at the fir&s;t view precarious; for the chargeable articles of the windmills, the boiling, cooling and di&s;tilling hou&s;es, and the buying and &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting a &s;uitable number of &s;laves and cattle, will not &s;uffer any man to begin a &s;ugar plan|tation of any con&s;equence, not to mention the purcha&s;e of the land, which is very high, under a capital of at lea&s;t five thou&s;and pounds. Neither is the life of a planter, a life of idle|ne&s;s and luxury; at all times he mu&s;t keep a watchful eye upon his over&s;eers, and even over&s;ee him&s;elf occa&s;ionally. But at the boil|ing &s;ea&s;on, if he is properly attentive to his
<PB N="100" REF="102">
affairs, no way of life can be more laborious, and more dangerous to the health; from a con&s;tant attendance day and night in the ex|treme united heats of the climate and &s;o many fierce furnaces; add to this the lo&s;&s;es by hurricanes, earthquakes, and bad &s;ea&s;ons; and then con&s;ider, when the &s;ugars are in the ca&s;k, that he quits the hazard of a planter, to en|gage in the hazards of a merchant, and &s;hips his produce at his own ri&s;k. The &s;um of all might make one believe, that it could never an&s;wer to engage in this bu&s;ine&s;s; but notwith&s;tanding all this, there are no parts of the world, in which great e&s;tates are made in &s;o &s;hort a time as in the We&s;t-Indies. The produce of a few good &s;ea&s;ons will provide again&s;t the ill effects of the wor&s;t; as the planter is &s;ure of a &s;peedy and profitable mar|ket for his produce, which has a readier &s;ale than perhaps any other commodity in the world.</P>
<P>Large plantations are generally under the care of a manager or chief over&s;eer, who has commonly a &s;alary of a hundred and fifty pounds a year, with over&s;eers under him in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the plantation, one to about thirty negroes, and at the rate of a|bout forty pounds. Such plantations too have a &s;urgeon at a fixed &s;alary, employed to take care of the negroes which belong to it. But the cour&s;e, which is the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome to the
<PB N="101" REF="103">
owner of the e&s;tate, is to let the land with all the works, and the &s;tock of cattle and &s;laves, to a tenant, who gives &s;ecurity for the payment of the rent, and the keeping up repairs and the &s;tock. The e&s;tate is generally e&s;timated to &s;uch a tenant at half the neat produce of the be&s;t years. Such tenants, if indu&s;trious and frugal men, &s;oon make good e&s;tates for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The negroes in the plantations are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at a very ea&s;y rate. This is generally by al|lotting to each family of them a &s;mall portion of land, and allowing them two days in the week, Saturday and Sunday, to cultivate it; &s;ome are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in this manner, but others find their negroes them&s;elves with a certain portion of Guinea or Indian corn, and to &s;ome a &s;alt herring, or a &s;mall quantity of bacon or &s;alt pork a day. All the re&s;t of the charge con&s;i&s;ts in a cap, a &s;hirt, a pair of breeches, &s;tockings and &s;hoes; the whole not exceeding forty &s;hillings a year.</P>
<P>To particulari&s;e the commodities proper for the We&s;t-India market, would be to enu|merate all the nece&s;&s;aries, conveniencies, and luxuries of life; for they have nothing of their own but the commodities I have already mentioned. Traders there make a very large profit upon all they &s;ell; and all kind of han|dicraft&s;men, e&s;pecially carpenters, bricklayers and bra&s;iers, get very great encouragement.</P>

<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition to indu&s;try has a varie|ty of characters, and is by no means con&s;tantly of the &s;ame colour. Some acquie&s;ce in a moderate labour through the whole of their lives, attended with no ri&s;k either to their per&s;ons or their gains; &s;uch &s;ort of peo|ple, who form the be&s;t citizens in general, are fit to &s;tay at home. Others full as remote from an indolent di&s;po&s;ition, are of quite a different character. The&s;e are fiery, re&s;tle&s;s tempers, willing to undertake the &s;evere&s;t la|bour, provided it promi&s;es but a &s;hort conti|nuance, who love ri&s;k and hazard, who&s;e &s;chemes are always va&s;t, and who put no medium between being great and being un|done. Characters of this &s;ort, e&s;pecially when they happen in low and middling life, are often dangerous members in a regular and &s;et|tled community. But the We&s;t-Indies opens a fair and ample field to encourage per&s;ons of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition; and it may be reckoned one very great benefit of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in that part of the world, that be&s;ides the va&s;t quan|tities of our fabrics which they con&s;ume, our &s;eamen that they employ, and our revenues that they &s;upport, that they are a vent to carry off &s;uch &s;pirits, whom they keep occu|pied greatly to the public benefit. Our domi|nions
<PB N="103" REF="105">
are to circum&s;tanced, and afford &s;uch a variety, that all di&s;po&s;itions to bu&s;ine&s;s, of what kind &s;oever, may have exerci&s;e without pre&s;|&s;ing upon one another. It is be&s;ides a great happine&s;s, that unfortunate men, whom un|avoidable accident, the frowns of the world, or the cruelty of creditors, would have render|ed mi&s;erable to them&s;elves, and u&s;ele&s;s to the public, may find a &s;ort of a&s;ylum, where at la&s;t they often &s;ucceed &s;o well, as to have rea|&s;on to ble&s;s tho&s;e accidents, which drove them from their country poor, de&s;erted and de&s;pi&s;|ed, to return them to it in opulence and cre|dit. Of &s;uch a change every one can produce many in&s;tances of his own knowledge; as whoever looks about him cannot fail to &s;ee a great number of per&s;ons, who having taken wrong &s;teps in the beginning of their lives, have e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a character of weakne&s;s and imprudence, as prevents them ever after from being tru&s;ted or employed, wherever they are at all known, although their charac|ters &s;hould be altogether chang'd, and the pa&s;&s;ions quite &s;ub&s;ided which gave occa&s;ion to their errors. Such per&s;ons become, fir&s;t, indigent, then de&s;perate, and at la&s;t, abandon|ed; but when they have an opportunity of going where this prejudice does not operate again&s;t them, they &s;et up as new men. With the advan|tage of an experience acquired by their mi&s;takes
<PB N="104" REF="106">
they are free from the ill reputation which attended them; and they prove of va&s;t &s;ervice to their country, to which they could be of no advantage whil&s;t they remained in it. There are per&s;ons too, far more blameable than either of the former &s;orts, who having erred without proper caution in points of mo|rality, are de&s;ervedly regarded with di&s;tru&s;t and abhorrence, though they may be at bot|tom far from being utterly abandoned; and are &s;till, excepting their character, the &s;tuff proper for making very good men of the world.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;everal &s;orts of people, who with very few exceptions, have &s;ettled the We&s;t-Indies, and North America in a good mea&s;ure. And thus have we drawn from the ra&s;hne&s;s of hot and vi&s;ionary men; the im|prudence of youth; the corruption of bad morals; and even from the wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery of per&s;ons de&s;titute and undone, the great &s;ource of our wealth, our &s;trength and our power. And though this was neither the effect of our wi&s;dom, nor the con&s;equence of our fore&s;ight; yet having happened, it may tend to give us more wi&s;dom and a bet|ter fore&s;ight; for it will undoubtedly be a &s;tanding monitor to us, how much we ought to cheri&s;h the colonies we have already e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, by every encouragement in our pow|er, and by every rea&s;onable indulgence; and it will be an additional &s;pur to make us active
<PB N="105" REF="107">
in the acqui&s;ition of new ones. Since expe|rience has taught us, that as there is no &s;oil or climate which will not &s;hew it&s;elf grate|ful to culture, &s;o that there is no di&s;po&s;ition, no character in mankind, which may not be turned with dextrous management to the public advantage. The&s;e rulers, who make complaints of the temper of their people in almo&s;t any re&s;pect, ought rather to lament their own want of genius, which blinds them to the u&s;e of an in&s;trument purpo&s;ely put in|to their hands by providence, for effecting perhaps the greate&s;t things. There are humours in the body, which contained may be noxious to it, yet which &s;ent abroad are the pro|per materials for generating new bodies. Pro|vidence, and a great mini&s;ter who &s;hould imitate providence, often gain their ends by means, that &s;eem mo&s;t contrary to them; for earthquakes, and hurricanes, and floods, are as nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of things, as calms and &s;un-&s;hine; life and beauty are drawn from death and corruption; and the mo&s;t ef|ficacious medicines are often found united with the mo&s;t deadly poi&s;ons. This, as it is well known, is the order of nature, and perhaps it might not unwi&s;ely be con&s;idered, as an ex|ample for government.</P>

<P>THOUGH we have drawn &s;uch great advantages from our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t-Indies, and are, even in our pre&s;ent way of acting, likely to continue to draw &s;till more; and though we have not wholly neglected the culture of that u&s;eful province; yet &s;ome will think, that there are &s;ome things yet left undone, &s;ome things in which our neighbours have &s;et us a laudable example, and &s;ome others, which the inconveniencies we have felt from the want of them demon&s;trate to be nece&s;&s;ary to our&s;elves. But it is not my purpo&s;e to handle this &s;ubject in its full ex|tent, &s;ince it is the wi&s;dom and power of the legi&s;lature, and not the unauthorized &s;pecula|tions of a private man, which can effect any thing u&s;eful in this way. A We&s;t-Indian who is naturally warm in his temper, and not too &s;ervilely obedient to the rules of the bien&s;eance, might find &s;ome faults in our proceedings here, and would perhaps rea&s;on in a manner not unlike the following.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"One would think from &s;ome in&s;tances, that at the di&s;tance we are placed from the &s;eat of authority, we were too remote to enjoy it's protection, but not to feel it's weight. In|numerable are the grievances which have oppre&s;&s;ed us from our infancy, and which
<PB N="107" REF="109">
contribute to bring on us a premature old age. Not one of the lea&s;t evils under which our plantations in the We&s;t-Indies groan, is the &s;upport of an expen&s;ive civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;uited rather to an e&s;tabli&s;hed and independent country in the plenitude of wealth and power, then to newly &s;ettled colonies, to which no|body thinks him&s;elf to belong as to his coun|try, and which &s;truggle with a total want of almo&s;t all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life. The building and maintaining the public works and fortifications, is a weight to which we are totally unequal, and the laying of which upon our &s;houlders is directly contrary to the very purpo&s;e for which you cultivate the colonies; for though the produce of the&s;e colonies is in general to be con&s;idered as a luxury, yet is it of the greate&s;t value to you; fir&s;t, as it &s;upplies you with things, which if not from us, you mu&s;t certainly take from foreign nations. Even in this view the colo|nies are extremely u&s;eful. But there is another, and a much more advantageous light in which you may view them; you may con&s;ider them as they &s;upply you with a commodity which you export to other countries, and which helps to bring the ballance of trade in your favour.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ecret of managing a foreign market, is contained in two words, to have the commodity of a good kind, and to &s;ell it
<PB N="108" REF="110">
cheap; and the whole dome&s;tic policy of trade con&s;i&s;ts in contriving to an&s;wer the&s;e two ends, and principally the latter. Now, by what magic can we effect to &s;ell as cheap as the French at any foreign market, when our planters pay four and a half per cent, duty upon all the &s;ugars, which they &s;hip off in America, and this after having had the &s;ame commodity in effect heavily taxed before by the poll on the negroes which work it, and by other impo&s;itions, which the planters en|dure according to the exigencies of the go|vernment? when the French planter pays a very in&s;ignificant poll-tax at wor&s;t, and not one per cent. duty upon all the &s;ugars he ex|ports; when he buys his negroes at an ea&s;ier rate than we can do; when he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> is more favoured upon every occa&s;ion, and is be&s;ides of a temper more indu&s;trious and frugal, than is found in our people. Be&s;ides this, upon &s;udden emergencies we run very much in debt; the i&s;land of Barbadoes at one &s;troke expended thirty thou&s;and pounds upon a for|tification, to &s;ay nothing of what this and what other i&s;lands have done in the &s;ame way and upon &s;imilar occa&s;ions? We are in reality only your factors; you in England ought to con&s;ider your&s;elves as the merchants, who &s;hould be at the whole expence, and &s;hould willingly abide by what&s;oever lo&s;s accrues; &s;ince the profits are all your own, and &s;ince in
<PB N="109" REF="111">
the end by the cour&s;e of trade, the lo&s;s too, let you take what &s;hifting mea&s;ures you plea&s;e to avoid it, and to cheat your&s;elves with ap|pearances. It is rea&s;onable that you &s;hould lay what duty you plea&s;e upon what is con&s;u|med among&s;t your&s;elves, becau&s;e you govern that market as you plea&s;e; but what you charge, or &s;uffer to be charged on the i&s;lands, is only the price of your own goods enhanced &s;o much at the foreign market; there you have no exclu&s;ive privilege, and there you are &s;ure to &s;uffer. If that duty which is laid in England upon the produce of our i&s;lands, or even half of it were expended, as in rea&s;on it ought, for the &s;upport of our e&s;tabli&s;hment, we might well be freed from the heavy bur|thens which we bear, and con&s;equently might be &s;omewhat upon a par with our neighbours. In our pre&s;ent condition, we not only pay very ample &s;alaries to our governors, but they are be&s;ides &s;uffered to make the mo&s;t they can by management of our weakne&s;s, to cheat us into voluntary gratuities, which we have given of|ten without a due con&s;ideration of our cir|cum&s;tances. This cu&s;tom prompts our go|vernors to u&s;e a thou&s;and arts equally unbe|coming their character, and prejudicial to the provinces they govern. It is this which in|duces them to foment tho&s;e divi&s;ions which tear us to pieces, and which prevent us from
<PB N="110" REF="112">
attending &s;eriou&s;ly and entirely to what will be&s;t advance the pro&s;perity of our &s;ettle|ments.</P>
<P>It were a tedious and di&s;agreeable ta&s;k, to run through all the mi&s;chiefs of which that one error of &s;ending a governor to make the mo&s;t he can of us is the fruitful &s;ource. The governor, I allow, ought to have every where a certain, rea&s;onable, and even a gen|teel &s;alary; but then, when he has this, he ought not to be in a condition to hope for any thing further, and ought to con&s;ider no|thing but how he may be&s;t perform the duty of his office.</P>
<P>But I hear it objected, that we are already extremely chargeable to England, who &s;ends her troops to protect us, and her fleets to cover our trade, at a very great expence, for which we ought to be contented, and even thankful; and that it is unrea&s;onable to ex|pect &s;he &s;hould bear every part of our burthen, loaded as &s;he is with the weight of a va&s;t national debt, and a mo&s;t expen&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of her own. But to this my an&s;wer is &s;hort, plain, and practical. The French do all this. They &s;end armies and fleets to protect their colonies as well as you; but they &s;up|port the e&s;tabli&s;hment in their own plantations notwith&s;tanding; and they are far from &s;up|po&s;ing this an in&s;upportable burthen. They
<PB N="111" REF="113">
know that a little judicious expence is often the be&s;t oeconomy in the world, and that in this ca&s;e, it is only &s;paring their own &s;ubjects in the We&s;t-Indies, and levying the money laid out for their u&s;e upon the foreign con&s;umer. What they do, I &s;ee no impo&s;&s;ibility of our doing. They learned many of their maxims of trade, as well as many of the fabrics which &s;upply it, from us; I wi&s;h we would learn from them in our turn. We have, indeed, &s;ome years ago ea&s;ed the trade, by permitting &s;hips from the i&s;lands to carry our produce out directly to foreign markets; but &s;till it is &s;o clogged, that we do not feel all the benefit which we might expect from a more general and better regulated liberty. Not to carry our enquiries further, &s;ee what you have gained by prohibit|ing us to land our &s;ugars directly in Ireland, before they are fir&s;t entered in an Engli&s;h port. What was the con&s;equence? why your &s;ugars grew dear by this loading and unload|ing, and pa&s;&s;ing backward and forward. The Portugue&s;e offered &s;ugars of at lea&s;t equal good|ne&s;s, and at a much more moderate price. The merchants in Ireland would not refu&s;e &s;o good an offer out of a compliment to you, who in this in&s;tance paid them no com|pliment at all; and you cannot, for very good rea&s;ons, di&s;pute with the Portugue&s;e about it. If this has happened at home, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be infinitely wor&s;e abroad.
<PB N="112" REF="114">
But it is &s;aid that our failures abroad are only owing to this; that we have not ground enough conveniently &s;ituated to produce more &s;ugar than &s;atisfies the home demand. But this is far enough from the ca&s;e. There is in &s;everal of the i&s;lands, but there is in Jamaica in particular, a great quantity of good land, and well enough &s;ituated too, if means were taken to bring it into culture, and a choice of markets to animate the planter in the cultiva|tion; who certainly de&s;erves every &s;ort of en|couragement, as he a&s;ks for nothing but to be put into &s;uch a condition, as may enable him to be of more &s;ervice to his mother country."</P></Q></P>

<P>IN the foregoing manner the We&s;t-Indian would &s;tate &s;ome part of what he con|ceives to be his grievances, and tho&s;e I believe he would be earne&s;t enough to have remedied. But there are other regulations, which a per&s;on not concerned in their affairs might think very proper too, but which the We&s;t-Indian would enter into with a much greater degree of phlegm.</P>
<P>There are now allowed to be in our We&s;t-Indies at lea&s;t two hundred and thirty thou&s;and negroe &s;laves; and it is allowed too, that upon the highe&s;t calculation the whites there, in all,
<PB N="113" REF="115">
do not amount to ninety thou&s;and &s;ouls. This di&s;proportion &s;hews &s;o clearly at the fir&s;t glance how much the colonies are endangered, both from within and without; how much expo&s;ed to the a&s;&s;aults of a foreign enemy, and to the in&s;urrection of their own &s;laves, (which latter circum&s;tance in all our i&s;lands keeps the people in perpetual apprehen&s;ions) that it may be a ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;urpri&s;e, that no mea&s;ures what&s;oever are taken to correct this dangerous irregularity.</P>
<P>This di&s;proportion between the freemen and negroes grows more vi&s;ible every day. That enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit which the novelty of the object, and various concurrent cau&s;es had produced in the la&s;t century, has decay|ed very much. We have as many men indigent and unemployed at home as we had then; but they have not the &s;ame &s;pirit and activity they had at that time. The di&s;po|&s;ition of the people in the We&s;t-Indies concurs with that of our people at home, to increa&s;e and to perpetuate the evil of which I com|plain; for they chu&s;e to do every thing by negroes, which can po&s;&s;ibly be done by them; and though they have laws and ordinances to oblige them to keep a certain number of white &s;ervants in &s;ome proportion to their blacks, in mo&s;t places the&s;e laws are but a dead letter. They find it more ea&s;y to pay the penalty when &s;eldom it is exacted, than
<PB N="114" REF="116">
to comply with the law. Their avarice in the particulars makes them blind to the hazards to which they expo&s;e the &s;um total of their affairs. This di&s;po&s;ition in the planters is now almo&s;t grown inveterate, and to &s;uch a degree, that the remedy will probably never be admini&s;tred by them&s;elves; and if this di&s;po&s;ition continues, in a little time, (which is indeed nearly the ca&s;e already,) all the Engli&s;h in our colonies there will con&s;i&s;t of little more than a few planters and merchants; and the re&s;t will be a de&s;picable, though a dangerous, becau&s;e a numerous and di&s;affected herd of African &s;laves.</P>
<P>Indubitably the &s;ecurity, as well as the &s;olid wealth of every nation, con&s;i&s;ts princi|pally in the number of low and middling men of a free condition, and that beautiful grada|tion from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, where the tran&s;itions all the way are almo&s;t im|perceptible. To produce this ought to be the aim and mark of every well regulated commonwealth, and none has ever flouri&s;hed upon other principles. But when we con|&s;ider the colony out of that independent light, and as it is related to Great Britain, it is clear that this neglect is of great detriment to the mother country; becau&s;e it is certain, that the con&s;umption of our commodities there would be in a great mea&s;ure in proportion to the number of white men; and there is nobody at
<PB N="115" REF="117">
all acquainted with the plantations, who will not readily allow, that when I &s;ay one white man takes off as much of our manufactures as three negroes, that I e&s;timate his value to us at a very low rate.</P>
<P>But the nece&s;&s;ity of having there a proper number of whites is not only &s;trongly enforced by the con&s;ideration of the great gain which would from thence accrue to us, but from the va&s;t &s;avings which &s;uch an arrangement would produce. The militia of the We&s;t-Indies is exceedingly well trained, &s;o as to be in di&s;ci|pline not very much inferior, but in courage and &s;pirit beyond mo&s;t regular troops; and they really want nothing but &s;ufficient num|bers to be able fully to defend them&s;elves, and occa&s;ionally to annoy the enemy; for both which purpo&s;es they are infinitely more fit by being habituated to the climate, than raw troops, which in this part of the world can never meet the enemy in the field with much more than half their complement. A le&s;s number of troops would do there in all times, if this point was well &s;tudied; and I may ven|ture to &s;ay, that the tran&s;porting and comfort|ably providing for a proper number of men effectually to &s;ecure our colonies, and even to make any attempt upon them de&s;perate, would not have co&s;t the government one third part of the money, which for the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t has been expended in the tran&s;porting and
<PB N="116" REF="118">
maintaining of troops there, who die and wa&s;te away without any benefit to them&s;elves or their country; whereas the&s;e &s;ettlers, who would &s;o effectually intimidate a foreign enemy, and take away all hope of liberty from the negroes, would all the while be enriching their mother country, and paying a large intere&s;t for the &s;ums &s;he expended in their e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I am con&s;cious that many objections will be made again&s;t the very propo&s;al, and that many more would be &s;tarted again&s;t any effec|tual &s;cheme for increa&s;ing the number of white &s;ervants in the We&s;t-Indies. They are repre&s;ented, as of very little u&s;e, di&s;orderly, idle, drunken, and fitter to pervert the negroes, than to be any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them in their bu&s;i|ne&s;s. This I believe to be in general true; but this is no &s;ort of objection to having them; though it is an excellent argument for putting them, their ma&s;ters, and the whole colony under a better regulation. If we labour un|der great inconveniencies from the want of a police at home, this want is infinitely more vi&s;ible in the We&s;t-Indies, where for the mo&s;t part they all live without the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of re|ligion, in a &s;tate of vice and debauchery, which is really deplorable to con&s;ider them as men and chri&s;tians, and of a very bad a&s;pect in a political light. If therefore it &s;hould be thought convenient by the wi&s;dom of our government, at any time to enter into a &s;cheme
<PB N="117" REF="119">
for peopling the&s;e countries fully and proper|ly, it will be equally convenient at the &s;ame time to take &s;uch &s;trict mea&s;ures as may pre|&s;erve them from vice and idlene&s;s; a thing far enough from impracticable. Whenever &s;uch regulations &s;hall take place, they will in a good mea&s;ure an&s;wer another end too, the pre&s;erv|ing the health and lives of the people; a point which in all places every wi&s;e government will have very much at heart; but which is above all nece&s;&s;ary in a colony, where the people are an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, and where the climate it&s;elf is &s;ufficiently fatal.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations principally regard Jamai|ca, the large&s;t and be&s;t of our i&s;lands, where there are prodigious tracts of uncultivated land. As the rivers there are not navigable, and as &s;ugar is a bulky commodity, which cannot afford to pay for a very long land carriage, the coa&s;ts, or only the land very near the coa&s;ts, can be turned to that commodity. But if poor people were &s;ufficiently encouraged to &s;ettle in the inland parts, nece&s;&s;ity would oblige them to rai&s;e cotton, cacao, coffee, ginger, aloes, all&s;pice, the dying woods, and other things which require no va&s;t labour, are not &s;o burthen&s;ome in carriage, and which have all a &s;ufficient demand at home to en|courage people who do not look to great and &s;udden fortunes. And as we bring all the&s;e, e&s;pecially the cotton, which is of great u&s;e in
<PB N="118" REF="120">
our manufactures, from abroad, we might en|courage the rai&s;ing more of it by &s;ome mode|rate premium. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity too would oblige them to try experiments on cochineal, and various other things which we don't now think of, and which the climate would not refu&s;e. By degrees, and with good manage|ment, they would improve in the culture of many of the&s;e articles in which they are now defective; the careful would grow tolerably rich; and con&s;iderable works of many valuable commodities, as cocoa, cochineal, and even indigo, may be attempted with &s;mall capitals. Excepting the labour, I don't know that any of the&s;e require above two or three hun|dred pounds to begin with. So that whil&s;t the great &s;tocks, and the lands convenient to navigation are employed in &s;ugars, the &s;mall capitals and the inland might be employed in the le&s;s expen&s;ive, though not le&s;s u&s;eful articles I have mentioned; every part would flouri&s;h, and agriculture would have it's &s;hare with the other improvements; &s;o that the great number might be &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at le&s;s expence than the few are now main|tained. All this, I am confident, could be effected for twenty thou&s;and pounds, or le&s;s, properly laid out; and the i&s;land by this means be rendered in a few years three times more beneficial to us than it is at pre&s;ent. By the neglect of &s;ome encouragement of this
<PB N="119" REF="121">
kind, the great &s;tocks, and the running into a &s;taple which required them, have by degrees devoured the i&s;land. It is the nature of va&s;t &s;tocks to create a &s;ort of monopoly; and it is the nature of monopoly to aim at great profits from a comparatively little produce; but dif|fu&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s, and by bringing it within the com|pa&s;s of &s;everal, you will make them &s;it down each with a &s;mall profit, for all cannot hope a fortune, but the joint produce of all will be very con&s;iderable. Indigo was once very greatly produced in Jamaica, and it enriched the i&s;land to &s;o great a degree, that in the pari&s;h of Vere, where this drug was cultivated, they are &s;aid to have had no le&s;s than three hundred gentlemen's coaches; a number I do not ima|gine even the whole i&s;land exceeds at this day; and there is great rea&s;on to believe, that there were many more per&s;ons of property in Jamaica formerly than are there now, though perhaps they had not tho&s;e va&s;t fortunes, which dazzle us in &s;uch a manner at pre|&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I have indulged my&s;elf &s;o long in a &s;peculation, which appears to me very material to the welfare of the&s;e colonies, I &s;hall venture to &s;ay &s;omething farther con|cerning another part of the inhabitants, tho' it may perhaps meet no warm reception from tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t nearly concerned.</P>
<P>The negroes in our colonies endure a &s;lavery more compleat, and attended with far wor&s;e circum&s;tances, than what any people in their condition &s;uffer in any other part of the world, or have &s;uffered in any other period of time. Proofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious wa&s;te which we experience in this unhappy part of our &s;pecies, is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth. The i&s;land of Barbadoes, (the negroes upon which do not amount to eighty thou&s;and) notwith|&s;tanding all the means which they u&s;e to increa&s;e them by propagation, notwith&s;tand|ing that the climate is in every re&s;pect, except that of being more whol&s;ome, exactly re&s;embling the climate from whence they come; notwith&s;tanding all this, Barbadoes lies under a nece&s;&s;ity of an annual recruit of five thou&s;and &s;laves to keep up the &s;tock at the number I have mentioned. This prodigiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="121" REF="123">
failure, which is at lea&s;t in the &s;ame propor|tion in all our i&s;lands, &s;hews demon&s;tratively that &s;ome uncommon and in&s;upportable hard|&s;hip lies upon the negroes, which wears them down in &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing manner; and this, I imagine, is principally the exce&s;&s;ive labour which they undergo. For previou&s;ly, I &s;uppo&s;e, that none of the inhabitants of the countries between the tropics are capable, even in their own climates, of near &s;o much labour without great prejudice to them, as our people are in ours. But in our plan|tations the blacks work &s;everely for five days, without any relaxation or intermi&s;&s;ion, for the benefit of the ma&s;ter, and the other two days they are obliged to labour for their own &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence during the re&s;t of the week; and this, I imagine, with the other circum&s;tances of great &s;everity which depre&s;s their &s;pirits, na|turally cuts off great numbers, as well as di&s;|qualifies tho&s;e who remain from &s;upplying this wa&s;te by natural propagation.</P>
<P>The planter will &s;ay, that if he is to allow his negroes more recreation, and to indulge them in more hours of ab&s;ence from their work, he can never reimbur&s;e him&s;elf for the charge he has been at in the purcha&s;e of the &s;lave, nor make the profits which induced him to go to that expence. But this, though it appears plau&s;ible enough at fir&s;t, becau&s;e the &s;laves are very dear, and becau&s;e they
<PB N="122" REF="124">
do not yield above ten or twelve pounds a head annually clear profit by their labour, is not|with&s;tanding very fallacious. For let it be con&s;idered, that out of their &s;tock of eighty thou&s;and in Barbadoes, there die every year five thou&s;and negroes more than are born in that i&s;land: in effect this people is under a nece&s;&s;ity of being entirely renewed every &s;ixteen years; and what mu&s;t we think of the management of a people, who far from increa&s;ing greatly, as tho&s;e who have no lo&s;s by wars ought to do, mu&s;t in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time as &s;ixteen years, without foreign recruits, be entirely con&s;umed to a man? Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e &s;laves &s;tand the Barbadians in no more than twenty pounds a head out of the &s;hip; whereas, in reality, they co&s;t a great deal more; this makes one hundred thou&s;and pounds every year, and in &s;ixteen years one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds. A &s;um really a&s;toni&s;hing, and amount|ing to a fourth of the value of every thing they export.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e, that by allowing a more moderate labour, and &s;ome other indulgen|ces, a great number of the&s;e deaths might be prevented, (and many I think it is probable would &s;o be prevented,) and that they could keep up within a thou&s;and of their &s;tock, (and why they could not entirely keep it up by &s;uch means, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s) they would &s;ave in this way eighty thou&s;and pounds
<PB N="123" REF="125">
every year. But from thence we mu&s;t de|duct the time in which the&s;e &s;laves have been unemployed. I &s;uppo&s;e that all rea&s;onable indulgences might be given of every &s;ort for the difference of forty thou&s;and pounds, which is the labour of four thou&s;and &s;laves. This will be far from a &s;mall allowance, e&s;pecially as in this way le&s;s time will be lo&s;t by &s;ickne&s;s, and the &s;urgeon will have le&s;s employment. Then, after all deductions, by behaving like good men, good ma&s;ters, and good chri&s;tians, the inhabitants of this one i&s;land would &s;ave forty thou&s;and pounds a year; which if in|&s;tead of being &s;aved, it were lo&s;t by &s;uch a proceeding, it ought to be con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary lo&s;s, and borne accordingly.</P>
<P>This matter, though not I think before &s;hewn in this &s;ame light, &s;eems in it&s;elf ex|tremely clear; but if it were yet clearer, there are &s;everal gentlemen of the We&s;t-Indies who could not comprehend it; though a waggoner in England will comprehend very clearly, that if he works his hor&s;e but mode|rately, and feeds him well, he will draw more profit from him in the end, than if he never gave him an hour's re&s;pite in the day from his work, and at night turned him upon the common for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. I am far from contending in favour of an effeminate indul|gence to the&s;e people. I know that they are &s;tubborn and intractable for the mo&s;t part,
<PB N="124" REF="126">
and that they mu&s;t be ruled with a rod of iron. I would have them ruled, but not cru&s;hed with it. I would have a humanity exerci&s;ed which is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;teadine&s;s. And I think it clear from the whole cour&s;e of hi&s;to|ry, that tho&s;e nations which have behaved with the greate&s;t humanity to their &s;laves, were always be&s;t &s;erved, and ran the lea&s;t hazard from their rebellions. And I am the more con|vinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e indulgences, as &s;laves certainly cannot go through &s;o much work as freemen. The mind goes a great way in every thing; and when a man knows that this labour is for him&s;elf; and that the more he labours, the more he is to acquire, this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s carries him through, and &s;upports him beneath fatigues, under which he otherwi&s;e would have &s;unk.</P>
<P>The prejudice this &s;aving would be to the African trade, is I know an objection which to &s;ome would appear very plau&s;ible. But &s;urely, one cannot hear without horror of a trade which mu&s;t depend for it's &s;upport upon the annual murder of &s;everal thou&s;ands of innocent men; and indeed nothing could excu&s;e the &s;lave trade at all, but the nece&s;&s;ity we are under of peopling our colonies, and the con&s;ideration that the &s;laves we buy were in the &s;ame condition in Africa, either heredi|tary, or taken in war. But in fact, if the wa&s;te of the&s;e men &s;hould become le&s;s, the price

<P>The principal time I would have re&s;erved for the indulgence I propo&s;e to be granted to the &s;laves, is Sunday, or the Lord's day; a day which is profaned in a manner altogether &s;candalous in our colonies.

<P>IT is &s;aid, that the law of England is favour|able to liberty; and &s;o far this ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t, that when we had men in a &s;ervile condition among&s;t us, the law took advantage even of neglects of the ma&s;ter to enfranchi&s;e the villain; and &s;eemed for that purpo&s;e even to &s;ubtilize a little; becau&s;e our ance&s;tors judged, that freemen were the real &s;upport of the kingdom. What if in our colonies we &s;hould go &s;o far, as to find out &s;ome medium between liberty and ab&s;olute &s;lavery, in which we might place all mulattoes after a certain limited &s;ervitude to the owner of the mother; and &s;uch blacks, who being born in the i&s;lands, their ma&s;ters for their good &s;ervices &s;hould think proper in &s;ome degree to enfran|chi&s;e?
<PB N="127" REF="129">
The&s;e might have land allotted them, or where that could not be &s;pared, &s;ome &s;ort of fixed employment, from either of which they &s;hould be obliged to pay a certain mode|rate rent to the public. Whatever they &s;hould acquire above this, to be the reward of their indu&s;try. The nece&s;&s;ity of paying the rent would keep them from idlene&s;s; and when men are once &s;et to work through ne|ce&s;&s;ity, they will not &s;top there; but they will gradually &s;trive for conveniencies, and &s;ome even for &s;uperfluities. All this will add to the demand for our goods, and the colony will be &s;trengthened by the addition of &s;o many men, who will have an intere&s;t of their own to fight for.</P>
<P>There is, among&s;t others, a very bad cu&s;tom in our colonies of multipyling their hou&s;hold &s;laves far beyond rea&s;on and nece&s;&s;ity. It is not uncommon for families of no very great fortunes, to have twenty-five or thirty in the capacity of menial &s;ervants only. The&s;e are &s;o many hands taken from planting, to be of no manner of u&s;e to the public; but they are infinitely the mo&s;t dangerous of the &s;laves; for being at all times about our people, they come to abate of that great reverence, which the field negroes have for the whites, without lo&s;ing any thing of the re&s;entment of their condition, which is common to both. And be&s;ides, in any in&s;urrection they have it more
<PB N="128" REF="130">
in their power to &s;trike a &s;udden and fatal blow. Surely a &s;umptuary law might be contrived to re&s;train the number of the&s;e me|nial &s;laves, as there might and ought to be one &s;trictly enjoining all who keep five &s;ervants, to have one white man and one white woman among&s;t them, without any power of being indulged in a contrary practice; as it ought to be a rule never to be broken through, to have not only the over&s;eers, but even all the drivers, white men.</P>
<P>The alarms we are under at the news of any petty armament in the We&s;t-Indies, is a demon&s;trative proof of the weakne&s;s of our condition there; which is, however, &s;o far from rou&s;ing us to &s;eek any proper remedy, that there are not wanting of the people of that country, many who would u&s;e a thou&s;and pretences to prevent our taking the only po&s;|&s;ible means of &s;ecuring their own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from danger; as the majority of men will always be found ready to prefer &s;ome pre|&s;ent gain to their future and more permanent intere&s;ts. But the apparent and dangerous progre&s;s of the French ought, methinks, to rou&s;e us from our long inaction, and to animate us to enterpri&s;e &s;ome regulations, in a &s;train of policy far &s;uperior to any thing I have ventured to hint, for the intere&s;t of the commerce, and the honour of the coun&s;els of the Briti&s;h nation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;omewhat difficult to a&s;certain the bounds of the Engli&s;h property in North America, to the northern and We&s;tern &s;ides; for to the Northward, it &s;hould &s;eem, that we might extend our claims quite to the pole it&s;elf, nor does any nation &s;eem inclined to di&s;pute the property of this Northermo&s;t country with us. France has by the treaty of Utrecht, ceded to us Hud&s;on's bay, the &s;treights of Hud&s;on, and all the country bor|dering upon that bay and tho&s;e &s;treights. If we &s;hould chu&s;e to take our &s;tand upon the Northern extremity of New Britain, or Terra de Labrador, and look to the South, we have a territory extending in that a&s;pect from the 60th to the 31&s;t degree of North latitude, and con&s;equently more than &s;eventeen hun|dred
<PB N="130" REF="132">
miles long in a direct line. This country is, all the way, wa&s;hed by the Atlantic ocean on the Ea&s;t; to the South it has the &s;mall re|mains of the Spani&s;h Florida; but to the We&s;tward, our bounds are di&s;puted by our enemies, and do not &s;eem well agreed upon among&s;t our&s;elves. They who govern them|&s;elves by the charters to our colonies, run their juri&s;diction quite acro&s;s the continent to the South-Sea; others contract our rights to the hither ranks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, and take four of the great lakes into our dominions. But upon what grounds they have fixed upon that river as a barrier, other than that rivers or mountains &s;eem to be a &s;pecies of natural boundaries, I cannot determine. Others (upon the &s;ame grounds, I &s;uppo&s;e,) have contract|ed us within limits yet narrower; they make the Apalachian mountains, the lake Ontario, and the river St. Laurence, the mo&s;t We&s;terly frontier of our rights in America. The French agreeing, in &s;ome re&s;pects, with the&s;e latter, (or the latter rather agreeing with the French, who&s;e maps they have for a long time &s;ervilely and &s;hamefully copied,) have made the moun|tains hem us in from their Southern com|mencement, to about the 44th degree of North latitude, or thereabouts, where this long chain terminates; then they draw a line &s;lanting to the North-Ea&s;t, by which they cut off a great part of the provinces of New-York,
<PB N="131" REF="133">
New England, and Nova Scotia, and leave our bounds at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the river St. Laurence, as they judge convenient.</P>
<P>This di&s;tribution, and the military di&s;po&s;i|tions which the French have made to &s;upport it, form the principal cau&s;e of the quarrel which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the two king|doms; and it is the i&s;&s;ue of this quarrel, which mu&s;t in&s;truct future geographers in adju&s;ting the boundaries of the two nations. For the pre&s;ent, I &s;hall only mention what we have &s;ettled, without offering any opinion of my own concerning our bounds. Our rights in Nova Scotia have been already a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed in a clear and cogent man|ner; but with regard to our claims in the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, the ra&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome writers in a matter which is a public concern, &s;eems to me very blameable. Some of them timidly or ignorantly drawing our territories into a very inconvenient narrowne&s;s; whil&s;t others have madly claimed all North America from &s;ea to &s;ea; &s;ome would give us very narrow bounds, whil&s;t others will hear of no bounds at all.</P>
<P>Po&s;terity will perhaps think it unaccount|able, that in a matter of &s;uch importance we could have been &s;o thoughtle&s;s as to leave on our back &s;uch a nation as France, without determining, in any manner, even &s;ufficiently clear to &s;ettle our own demands, what part of
<PB N="132" REF="134">
the country was our own right, or what we determined to leave to the di&s;cretion of our neighbours; or that wholly intent upon &s;et|tling the &s;ea coa&s;t, we have never ca&s;t an eye into the country, to di&s;cover the nece&s;&s;ity of mak|ing a barrier again&s;t them, with a proper force; which formerly did not need to have been a very great one, nor to be maintained at any great expence. That cheap and timely cauti|on would have &s;aved us thou&s;ands of lives and millions of money; but the hour is now pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, I think it better neither to con&s;ider our &s;ettlements directly in the order of the time of their e&s;tabli&s;hment, nor of their advantage to the mother country, but as they lie near one another, North and South from New England to Carolina; re&s;er|ving for the end the new &s;ettlements on the Northern and Southern extremities, tho&s;e of Nova Scotia and Georgia, and the un&s;et|tled countries about Hud&s;on's bay.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WE derive our rights in America from the di&s;covery of Seba&s;tian Cabot, who fir&s;t made the Northern continent in 1497. The fact is &s;ufficiently certain to e&s;tabli&s;h a right to our &s;ettlements in North America: but the particulars are not known di&s;tinctly enough to encourage me to enter into a detail of his voyage. The country was in general called Newfoundland, a name which is now appropriated &s;olely to an i&s;land upon it's coa&s;t. It was a long time before we made any at|tempt to &s;ettle this country; though in this point we were no more backward than our neighbours, who probably did not ab&s;tain &s;o long out of re&s;pect to our prior di&s;covery. Sir Walter Raleigh &s;hewed the way, by planting a colony in the Southern part, which he called Virginia. However, the &s;pirit of colonization was not yet fully rai&s;ed. Men lived at ea&s;e in their own country, and the new &s;ettlement of Virginia, though dre&s;&s;ed up in all the &s;howy colours which eloquence could be&s;tow upon it, gave adventurers but little encouragement. The affairs of North America were in the hands of an exclu&s;ive company, and they pro&s;pered accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">Things remained in this condition until the latter end of the reign of James the fir&s;t. From the commencement of the reformation in England, two parties of prote&s;tants &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed among&s;t us; the fir&s;t had cho&s;en gradually and almo&s;t imperceptibly to recede from the church of Rome; &s;oftening the lines, rather than era&s;ing the figure, they made but very little alteration in the appearances of things. And the people &s;eeing the exterior &s;o little altered, hardly perceived the great changes they had made in the doctrines of their religion. The other party of a warmer temper, had more zeal and le&s;s policy. Several of them had fled from the per&s;e|cution in queen Mary's days; and they re|turned in tho&s;e of queen Elizabeth with minds &s;ufficiently heated by re&s;entment of their &s;ufferings, and by the perpetual di&s;putations which had exerci&s;ed them all the while they were abroad. Abroad they learned an aver|&s;ion to the epi&s;copal order, and to religious ce|remonies of every &s;ort; they were impregnated with an high &s;pirit of liberty, and had a &s;trong tendency to the republican form of govern|ment. Queen Elizabeth had enough of the blood of Harry the eighth, to make her impati|ent of an oppo&s;ition to her will, e&s;pecially in matters of religion, in which &s;he had an high opinion of her own knowledge. She advi&s;ed with this party but very little in the alterations
<PB N="135" REF="137">
which &s;he thought proper to make; and di&s;|liking the notions, which they &s;eemed to en|tertain in politics, &s;he kept them down during the whole cour&s;e of her reign with an uniform and inflexible &s;everity.</P>
<P>However, the party was far enough from being de&s;troyed. The merit of their &s;ufferings, the affected plainne&s;s of their dre&s;s, the gra|vity of their deportment, the u&s;e of &s;cripture phra&s;es upon the mo&s;t ordinary occa&s;ions, and even their names, which had &s;omething &s;trik|ing and venerable, as being borrowed from the old te&s;tament, or having a &s;ort of affected relation to religious matters, gained them a general e&s;teem among&s;t &s;ober people of ordi|nary under&s;tandings. This party was very nu|merous; and their zeal made them yet more con&s;iderable than their numbers. They were commonly called puritans.</P>
<P>When king James came to the throne, he had a very fair opportunity of pacifying mat|ters; or at wor&s;t he might have left them in the condition he found them; but it happen|ed quite otherwi&s;e. The unkingly di&s;putation at Hampton-court did more to encourage the puritans to per&s;evere in their opinions, by the notice which was taken of them, than all king James's logic, as a &s;cholar, backed with all his power as a king, could do to &s;uppre&s;s that party. They were per&s;ecuted, but not de&s;troyed; they were exa&s;perated, and yet left powerful: and a &s;everity was exerci&s;ed
<PB N="136" REF="138">
towards them, which at once expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s and the ill intentions of the govern|ment.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate things continued until the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Charles, when they were far from mending. This prince, endowed with many great virtues, had very few amiable qualities. As grave as the puritans them&s;elves, he could never engage the licentious part of the world in his favour; and that gravity being turned again&s;t the puritans, made him but the more odious to them. He gave him&s;elf up entirely to the church and churchmen; and he fini&s;h|ed his ill conduct in this re&s;pect, by conferring the fir&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity of the kingdom, and a great &s;way in temporal affairs, upon doctor Laud. Hardly fit to direct a college, he was called to govern a kingdom. He was one of tho&s;e indi&s;creet men of good inten|tions, who are the people in the world that make the wor&s;t figure in politics. This man thought he did good &s;ervice to religion by a &s;crupulous enquiry into the manner in which the mini&s;ters every where conformed to the regulations of the former reigns. He depriv|ed great numbers for nonconformity. Not &s;atisfied with this, in which perhaps he was ju&s;tifiable enough, if he had managed pru|dently, he made new regulations, and intro|duced on a people already abhorrent of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary ceremonies, ceremonies of a new kind, of a mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s nature, and &s;uch as
<PB N="137" REF="139">
were even ridiculous, if the &s;erious con&s;equen|ces which attended them may not intitle them to be con&s;idered as matters of importance.</P>
<P>Several great men, di&s;gu&s;ted at the proceed|ings of the court, and entertaining very rear|&s;onable apprehen&s;ions for the public liberty, to make them&s;elves popular, attached them|&s;elves to the popular notions of religion, and affected to maintain them with great zeal. Others became puritans through principle. And now their affairs put on a re&s;pectable appear|ance; in proportion as they became of con&s;e|quence their &s;ufferings &s;eemed to be more and more grievous; the &s;everities of Laud had rai&s;|ed not terror as formerly, but a &s;ort of indig|nant hatred; and they became every day further and further from li&s;tening to the lea&s;t terms of agreement with &s;urplices, organs, common-prayer, or table at the We&s;t end of the church. As they who are &s;erious about trifles, are &s;erious indeed, their lives began to grow mi|&s;erable to &s;everal on account of the&s;e ceremo|nies; and rather than be obliged to &s;ubmit to them, there was no part of the world to which they would not have fled with chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Early in the reign of king James a number of per&s;ons of this per&s;ua&s;ion had &s;ought refuge in Holland; in which, though a country of the greate&s;t religious freedom in the world, they did not find them&s;elves better &s;atisfied than they had been in England. There they
<PB N="138" REF="140">
were tolerated indeed, but watched; their zeal began to have dangerous languors for want of oppo&s;ition; and being without power or con&s;equence, they grew tired of the indo|lent &s;ecurity of their &s;anctuary; they cho&s;e to remove to a place where they &s;hould &s;ee no &s;uperior; and therefore they &s;ent an agent to England, who agreed with the council of Plymouth for a tract of land in America, within their juri&s;diction, to &s;ettle in, after they had obtained from the king a privilege to do &s;o. The Plymouth council was a com|pany, who by their charter had not only all the coa&s;t of North America from Nova Scotia to the Southern parts of Carolina, (the whole country being then di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of South and North Virginia) as a &s;cene for their exclu&s;ive trade; but they had the entire property of the &s;oil be&s;ides.</P>
<P>This colony e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf at a place which they called New Plymouth. They were but few in number; they landed in a bad &s;ea&s;on; and they were not at all &s;upported but from their private funds. The winter was premature, and terribly cold. The coun|try was all covered with wood, and afforded very little for the refre&s;hment, of per&s;ons &s;ickly with &s;uch a voyage, or for &s;u&s;tenance of an infant people. Near half of them peri&s;hed by the &s;curvy, by want, and the &s;everity of the climate; but they who &s;urvived, not di&s;pirited
<PB N="139" REF="141">
with their lo&s;&s;es, nor with the hard&s;hips they were &s;till to endure, &s;upported by the vigour which was then the character of Engli&s;h|men, and by the &s;atisfaction of finding them|&s;elves out of the reach of the &s;piritual arm, they reduced this &s;avage country to yield them a tolerable livelihood, and by degrees a comfort|able &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>This little e&s;tabli&s;hment was made in the year 1621. Several of their brethren in England labouring under the &s;ame difficulties, took the &s;ame methods of e&s;caping from them. The colony of puritans in&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed; but as yet they had not extended them&s;elves much beyond New Plymouth. It was in the year 1629, that the colony began to flouri&s;h in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;oon became a con&s;iderable people. By the clo&s;e of the en&s;uing year they had built four towns, Salem, Dorche&s;ter, Charles-town, and Bo&s;|ton which has &s;ince become the capital of New-England. That enthu&s;ia&s;m which was rever&s;ing every thing at home, and which is &s;o dangerous in every &s;ettled community, proved of admirable &s;ervice here. It became a principle of life and vigour, that enabled them to conquer all the difficulties of a &s;avage country. Their exact and &s;ober manners proved a &s;ub&s;titute for a proper &s;ubordination, and regular form of government, which they had for &s;ome time wanted, and the want of which
<PB N="140" REF="142">
in &s;uch a country had otherwi&s;e been felt very &s;everely.</P>
<P>And now, not only they who found them|&s;elves unea&s;y at home upon a religious account, but &s;everal on account of the then profitable trade of furs and &s;kins, and for the &s;ake of the fi&s;hery, were invited to &s;ettle in New Eng|land. But this colony received it's principal a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the di&s;content of &s;everal great men of the puritan party, who were it's pro|tectors, and who entertained a de&s;ign of &s;et|ling among&s;t them in New England, if they &s;hould fail in the mea&s;ures they were pur&s;uing for e&s;tabli&s;hing the liberty, and reforming the religion of their mother country. They &s;ollicit|ed grants in New England, and were at a great expence in &s;ettling them. Among&s;t the&s;e paten|tees, we &s;ee the lords Brooke, Say and Seale, the Pelhams, the Hampdens, and the Pyms; the names which afterwards appeared with &s;o much eclat upon a greater &s;tage. It was &s;aid that &s;ir Matthew Boynton, &s;ir William Con&s;table, &s;ir Arthur Ha&s;lerig, and Oliver Cromwell were actually upon the point of embarking for New England; when archbi&s;hop Laud, unwilling that &s;o many objects of his hatred &s;hould be removed out of the reach of his power, applied for, and obtained an order from the court to put a &s;top to the&s;e tran&s;por|tations; and thus he kept forcibly from vent|ing it&s;elf that virulent humour which he lived
<PB N="141" REF="143">
to &s;ee the de&s;truction of him&s;elf, his order, his religion, his ma&s;ter, and the con&s;titution of his country. However, he was not able to prevail &s;o far as to hinder New England from receiving va&s;t reinforcements, as well of the clergy who were deprived of their livings, or not admitted to them for nonconformity, as of &s;uch of the laity who adhered to their opinions.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>THE part of New England called Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;et's Bay, had now &s;ettlements very thick all along the &s;ea &s;hore. Some &s;lips from the&s;e were planted in the province of Main and New Hamp&s;hire, being torn from the ori|ginal &s;tock by the religious violence, which was the chief characteri&s;tic of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in New England. The patentees we la&s;t mentioned, principally &s;ettled upon the river Connecticut, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;eparate and in|dependent government there: &s;ome per&s;ons having before that fixed them&s;elves upon the borders of this river, who fled from the ty|ranny ari&s;ing from the religious differences which were moulded into the fir&s;t principles of the Plymouth and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's colonies.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time the people of New England had hardly any that de&s;erved the name of a regular form of government. The
<PB N="142" REF="144">
court took very little care of them. By their charter they were empowered to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an order, and to make &s;uch laws as they plea&s;ed, provided they were not contrary to the laws of England. A point not ea&s;ily &s;ettled, neither was there any means appointed for &s;ettling it. As they who compo&s;ed the new colonies were generally per&s;ons of a con|tracted way of thinking, and mo&s;t violent enthu&s;ia&s;ts, they imitated the Jewi&s;h polity in almo&s;t all re&s;pects; and adopted the books of Mo&s;es as the law of the land. The fir&s;t laws which they made were grounded upon them, and were therefore very ill &s;uited to the cu&s;toms, genius, or circum&s;tances of that country, and of tho&s;e times; for which rea&s;on they have &s;ince fallen into difu&s;e.</P>
<P>As to religion, it was, as I have &s;aid, the puritan. In England this could hardly be con&s;idered as a formed &s;ect at the time of their emigration, &s;ince &s;everal who had re|ceived epi&s;copal ordination were reckoned to belong to it. But as &s;oon as they found them|&s;elves at liberty in America, they fell into a way very little different from the independent mode. Every pari&s;h was &s;overeign with|in it&s;elf. Synods indeed were occa&s;ionally called, but they &s;erved only to prepare and dige&s;t matters, which were to receive their &s;anction from the approbation of the &s;everal churches. The &s;ynods could exerci&s;e no
<PB N="143" REF="145">
branch of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, either as to doctrine or to di&s;cipline. They had no power of excommunication. They could only refu&s;e to hold communion with tho&s;e who&s;e principles and practices they di&s;liked. The magi&s;trates a&s;&s;i&s;ted in tho&s;e &s;ynods, not only to hear, but to deliberate and determine. From &s;uch a form as this, great religious freedom might, one would have imagined, be well expected. But the truth is, they had no idea at all of &s;uch a freedom. The very doctrine of any &s;ort of toleration was &s;o odious to the greater part, that one of the fir&s;t per&s;ecutions &s;et up here was again&s;t a &s;mall party which aro&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves, who were hardy enough to maintain, that the civil magi&s;trate had no lawful power to u&s;e com|pul&s;ory mea&s;ures in affairs of religion. After harra&s;&s;ing the&s;e people by all the vexatious ways imaginable, they obliged them to fly out of their juri&s;diction. The&s;e emigrants &s;et|tled them&s;elves to the Southward, near Cape Cod, where they formed a new government upon their own principles, and built a town, which they called Providence. This has &s;ince made the fourth and &s;malle&s;t, but not the wor&s;t inhabited of the New England govern|ments, called Rhode I&s;land, from an i&s;land of that name which forms a part of it. As a per&s;ecution gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of New England, &s;o a &s;ub&s;equent per&s;ecution in this
<PB N="144" REF="146">
colony gave ri&s;e to new colonies, and this facilitated the &s;preading of the people over the country.</P>
<P>If men, merely for the moderation of their &s;entiments, were expo&s;ed to &s;uch &s;evere treat|ment, it was not to be expected that others &s;hould e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. The very fir&s;t colony had hardly &s;et it's foot on &s;hore in America, when finding that &s;ome among&s;t them were fal&s;e brethren, and ventured to make u&s;e of the common prayer, they found means of making the country &s;o unea&s;y to them, that they were glad to fly back to England.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they began to think of making laws, I find no le&s;s than five about matters of religion; all contrived, and not only con|trived, but executed in &s;ome re&s;pects with &s;o much rigour, that the per&s;ecution which drove the puritans out of England, might be con&s;idered as great lenity and indulgence in the compari&s;on. For in the fir&s;t of the&s;e laws, they deprive every one who does not communicate with their e&s;tabli&s;hed church, of the right to his freedom, or a vote in the election of any of their magi&s;trates. In the &s;econd, they &s;entence to bani&s;hment any who &s;hould oppo&s;e the fourth commandment, or deny the validity of infant bapti&s;m, or the authority of magi&s;trates. In the third, they condemn quakers to bani&s;hment, and make it
<PB N="145" REF="147">
capital for them to return. And not &s;topping at the offenders, they lay heavy fines upon all who &s;hould bring them into the province, or even harbour them for an hour. In the fourth they provide bani&s;hment, and death in ca&s;e of return, for je&s;uits and Popi&s;h prie&s;ts of every denomination. In the fifth they de|cree death to any who &s;hall wor&s;hip images. After they had provided &s;uch a complete code of per&s;ecution, they were not long without op|portunities of reading bloody lectures upon it. The quakers, warmed with that &s;pirit which animates the beginning of mo&s;t &s;ects, had &s;pread their doctrines all over the Briti&s;h do|minions in Europe, and began at la&s;t to &s;pread them with equal zeal in America. The clergy and the magi&s;trates in New-England took the alarm; they &s;eized upon &s;ome of tho&s;e people, they &s;et them in the &s;tocks and in the pillory without effect; they &s;courged, they impri&s;oned, they bani&s;hed them; they treated all tho&s;e who &s;eemed to commi&s;erate their &s;ufferings with great rigour; but their per&s;ecution had no other effect than to in|flame their own cruelty and the zeal of the &s;ufferers. The con&s;tancy of the quakers under their &s;ufferings begot a pity and e&s;teem for their per&s;ons, and an approbation of their doctrines; their pro&s;elytes increa&s;ed; the quakers returned as fa&s;t as they were bani&s;hed; and the fury of the ruling party was rai&s;ed to
<PB N="146" REF="148">
&s;uch a height, that they proceeded to the mo&s;t &s;anguinary extremities. Upon the law they had made, they &s;eized at different times upon five of tho&s;e who had returned from bani&s;h|ment, condemned and hanged them. It is unknown how far their madne&s;s had extend|ed, if an order from the king and council in England about the year 1661 had not inter|po&s;ed to re&s;train them.</P>
<P>It is a ta&s;k not very agreeable to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch matters; but in reality, things of this nature form the greate&s;t part of the hi&s;tory of New England, for along time. They per&s;ecuted the anabapti&s;ts, who were no incon&s;iderable body among&s;t them, with almo&s;t an equal &s;e|verity. In &s;hort, this people, who in England could not bear being cha&s;ti&s;ed with rods, had no &s;ooner got free from their fetters than they &s;courged their fellow refugees with &s;cor|pions; though the ab&s;urdity, as well as the inju&s;tice of &s;uch a proceeding in them, might &s;tare them in the face!</P>
<P>One may ob&s;erve, that men of all per&s;ua&s;ions confine the word per&s;ecution, and all the ill ideas of inju&s;tice and violence which belong to it, &s;olely to tho&s;e &s;everities which are exer|ci&s;ed upon them&s;elves, or upon the party they are inclined to favour. Whatever is inflicted upon others, is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon ob&s;ti|nate impiety, and not a re&s;traint upon con|&s;cientious differences. The per&s;ecution we
<PB N="147" REF="149">
have our&s;elves &s;uffered, is a good ground for retaliation again&s;t an old enemy; and if one of our friends and fellow &s;ufferers &s;hould prove &s;o wicked as to quit our cau&s;e, and weaken it by his di&s;&s;ention, he de&s;erves to be puni&s;hed yet more than the old enemy him|&s;elf. Be&s;ides this, the zealous never fail to draw political inferences from religious tenets, by which they intere&s;t the magi&s;trate in the di&s;pute; and then to the heat of a religious fervour is added the fury of a party zeal. All intercour&s;e is cut off between the parties. They lo&s;e all knowledge of each other, tho' countrymen and neighbours, and are there|fore ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon with the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd &s;tories concerning each others opinions and practices. They judge of the hatred of the adver&s;e &s;ide by their own. Then fear is added to their hatred; and preventive injuries ari&s;e from their fear. The remembrance of the pa&s;t, the dread of the future the pre&s;ent ill, will join together to urge them forward to the mo&s;t violent cour&s;es.</P>
<P>Such is the manner of proceeding of re|ligious parties towards each other; and in this re&s;pect the New England people are not wor&s;e than the re&s;t of mankind, nor was their &s;eve|rity any ju&s;t matter of reflection upon that mode of religion which they profe&s;s. No religion what&s;oever, true or fal&s;e, can excu&s;e it's own members, or accu&s;e tho&s;e of any other
<PB N="148" REF="150">
upon the &s;core of per&s;ecution. The principles which give ri&s;e to it are common to all man|kind, and they influence them as they are men, and not as they belong to this or that per&s;ua&s;ion. In all per&s;ua&s;ions the bigots are per&s;ecutors; the men of a cool and rea&s;onable piety are favourers of toleration; becau&s;e the former &s;ort of men not taking the pains to be acquainted with the grounds of their adver|&s;aries tenets, conceive them to be &s;o ab&s;urd and mon&s;trous, that no man of &s;en&s;e can give into them in good earne&s;t. For which rea&s;on they are convinced that &s;ome oblique bad motive induces them to pretend to the belief of &s;uch doctrines, and to the maintain|ing of them with ob&s;tinacy. This is a very general principle in all religious differences, and it is the corner &s;tone of all per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the di&s;putes with tho&s;e of another denomination, the independents were for a long time harra&s;&s;ed with one in the bowels of their own churches. The &s;tale di&s;pute about grace and works produced di&s;&s;entions, riots, and almo&s;t a civil war in the colony. The famous &s;ir Henry Vane the younger, an en|thu&s;ia&s;tic, giddy, turbulent man, of a no very good di&s;po&s;ition, came hither with &s;ome of the adventurers; and rather than remain idle, plaid at &s;mall games in New England, where the people had cho&s;en him governor. It is not hard to conceive, how &s;uch a man, at the
<PB N="149" REF="151">
head of &s;uch a people, and engaged in &s;uch controver&s;y, could throw every thing into con|fu&s;ion. In the very height of this hopeful di&s;pute they had a war upon their hands with &s;ome of the Indian nations. Their country was terribly harra&s;&s;ed, and numbers were every day murdered by the incur&s;ions of the enemy. All this time they had an army in readine&s;s for action, which they would not &s;uffer to march even to defend their own lives and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the New England puritans be|gan to breathe a little from the&s;e di&s;|&s;entions, and had their hands tied up from per&s;ecuting the quakers and anabapti&s;ts, they fell not long after into another madne&s;s of a yet more extraordinary and dangerous kind, which, like &s;ome epidemical di&s;ea&s;e, ran through the whole country, and which is perhaps one of the mo&s;t extraordinary delu|&s;ions recorded in hi&s;tory. This tragedy began in the year 1692.</P>
<P>There is a town in New England, which they fanatically called Salem. One Paris was the mini&s;ter there. He had two daughters
<PB N="150" REF="152">
troubled with convul&s;ions; which being at|tended with &s;ome of tho&s;e extraordinary ap|pearances, not unfrequent in &s;uch di&s;orders, he imagined they were bewitched. As &s;oon as he concluded upon witchcraft as the cau&s;e of the di&s;temper, the next enquiry was how to find out the per&s;on who had bewitched them. He ca&s;t his eyes upon an Indian &s;ervant woman of his own, whom he frequently beat, and u&s;ed her with &s;uch &s;everity, that &s;he at la&s;t confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf the witch, and was commit|ted to gaol, where &s;he lay for a long time.</P>
<P>The imaginations of the people were not yet &s;ufficiently heated to make a very formal bu&s;ine&s;s of this; therefore they were content to di&s;charge her from pri&s;on after a long con|finement, and to &s;ell her as a &s;lave for her fees.</P>
<P>However, as this example &s;et the di&s;cour&s;e about witchcraft afloat, &s;ome people, troubled with a &s;imilar complaint, began to fancy them|&s;elves bewitched too. Per&s;ons in an ill &s;tate of health are naturally fond of finding out cau&s;es for their di&s;tempers; e&s;pecially &s;uch as are extraordinary, and call the eyes of the public upon them. There was perhaps &s;ome|thing of malice in the affair be&s;ides. For one of the fir&s;t objects whom they fixed upon was Mr. Burroughs, a gentleman who had former|ly been mini&s;ter of Salem; but upon &s;ome of the religious di&s;putes which divided the coun|try,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
he differed with his flock, and left them. This man was tried with two others for witchcraft by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer, directed to &s;ome of the gentle|men of the be&s;t fortunes, and reputed to be of the be&s;t under&s;tandings in the country. Before the&s;e judges, a piece of evidence was delivered, the mo&s;t weak and childi&s;h, the mo&s;t repug|nant to it&s;elf, and to common &s;en&s;e, that per|haps ever was known upon any &s;erious occa|&s;ion. Yet by tho&s;e judges, upon that evidence, and the verdict founded upon it, this mini&s;ter, a man of a mo&s;t unexceptionable character, and two others, men irreproachable in their lives, were &s;entenced to die, and accord|ingly hanged. Then the&s;e victims of the popular madne&s;s were &s;tript naked, and their bodies thrown into a pit, half covered with earth, and left to the di&s;cretion of birds and wild bea&s;ts. Upon the &s;ame evidence in a little time after &s;ixteen more &s;uffered death, the greate&s;t part of them dying in the mo&s;t exemplary &s;entiments of piety, and with the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of their innocence. One man refu&s;ing to plead, &s;uffered in the cruel manner the law directs on that occa&s;ion, by a &s;low pre&s;&s;ure to death.</P>
<P>The imaginations of the people, powerfully affected by the&s;e &s;hocking examples, turned upon nothing but the mo&s;t gloomy and horrid ideas. The mo&s;t ordinary and innocent
<PB N="152" REF="154">
actions were metamorpho&s;ed into magical ceremonies, and the fury of the people aug|mented in proportion as this gloom of imagi|nation increa&s;ed. The flame &s;pread with rage and rapidity into every part of country. Neither the tenderne&s;s of youth, nor the infirmity of age, nor the honour of the &s;ex, nor the &s;acredne&s;s of the mini&s;try, nor the re|&s;pectable condition of fortune or character, was the lea&s;t protection. Children of eleven years old were taken up for &s;orceries. The women were &s;tripped in the mo&s;t &s;hame|ful manner to &s;earch them for magical teats. The &s;corbutic &s;tains common on the &s;kins of old per&s;ons, were called the devil's pinches. This was indi&s;putable evidence again&s;t them. As &s;uch they admitted every idle flying re|port, and even &s;tories of gho&s;ts, which they honoured with a name, not found in our law books. They called them <HI>Spectral Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>What the&s;e extraordinary te&s;timonies want|ed was compleated by the torture; by which a number of the&s;e unhappy victims were driven to confe&s;s whatever their tormentors thought proper to dilate to them. Some women owned they had been lain with by the devil, and other things equally ridiculous and abominable.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to imagine the deplorable &s;tate of this province, when all mens lives de|pended upon the caprice and folly of di&s;ea&s;ed
<PB N="153" REF="155">
and di&s;tracted minds; when revenge and malice had a full opportunity of wreaking them&s;elves in the mo&s;t dreadful and bloody manner, by an in&s;trument that was always in readine&s;s, and to which the public phren|zy gave a certain and dangerous effect. What was a yet wor&s;e circum&s;tance, the wretches who &s;uffered the torture, being not more pre&s;|&s;ed to own them&s;elves guilty than to di&s;co|ver their a&s;&s;ociates and accomplices, unable to give any real account, named people at random, who were immediately taken up, and treated in the &s;ame cruel manner upon this extorted evidence. An univer&s;al terror and con&s;ternation &s;eized upon all. Some prevent|ed accu&s;ation, and charged them&s;elves with witchcraft, and &s;o e&s;caped death. Others fled the province; and many more were pre|paring to fly. The pri&s;ons were crouded; people were executed daily; yet the rage of the accu&s;ers was as fre&s;h as ever, and the number of the witches and the bewitch|ed increa&s;ed every hour. A magi&s;trate who had committed forty per&s;ons for this crime, fatigued with &s;o di&s;agreeable an em|ployment, and a&s;hamed of the &s;hare he had in it, refu&s;ed to grant any more warrants. He was him&s;elf immediately accu&s;ed of &s;orcery; and thought him&s;elf happy in leaving his fa|mily and fortune, and e&s;caping with life out of the province. A jury &s;truck with the af|fecting
<PB N="154" REF="156">
manner, and the &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of innocence of a woman brought before them, ventured to acquit her, but the judges &s;ent them in again; and in an imperious manner forced them to find the woman guilty, and &s;he was hanged immediately.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters, who&s;e pru|dence ought to have been employed in heal|ing this di&s;temper, and a&s;&s;uaging it's fury, threw in new combu&s;tible matter. They encouraged the accu&s;ers; they a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the examinations, and they extorted the confe&s;&s;i|ons of witches. None &s;ignalized their zeal more upon this occa&s;ion than Sir William Phips the governor, a New England man, of the lowe&s;t birth, and yet meaner education; who having rai&s;ed a &s;udden fortune by a lucky accident, was knighted, and afterwards made governor of this province. Doctor Encrea&s;e Mather, and Doctor Cotton Mather, the pillars of the New England church, were equally &s;anguine. Several of the mo&s;t popu|lar mini&s;ters after twenty executions had been made, addre&s;&s;ed Sir William Phips with thanks for what he had done and with ex|hortations to proceed in &s;o laudable a work.</P>
<P>The accu&s;ers encouraged in this manner did not know where to &s;top, nor how to proceed. They were at a lo&s;s for objects. They began at la&s;t to accu&s;s the judges them&s;elves. What was wor&s;e, the neare&s;t relations of Mr. En|crea&s;e
<PB N="155" REF="157">
Mather were involved, and witchcraft began even to approach the governor's own family. It was now high time to give things another turn. The accu&s;ers were di&s;cou|raged by authority. One hundred and fifty who lay in pri&s;on, were di&s;charged. Two hun|dred more were under accu&s;ation; they were pa&s;&s;ed over; and tho&s;e who had receiv|ed &s;entence of death, were reprieved, and in due time pardoned. A few cool moments &s;hewed them the gro&s;s and &s;tupid error that had carried them away, and which was utterly invi&s;ible to them all the while they were engaged in this &s;trange pro&s;ecution. They grew heartily a&s;hamed of what they had done. But what was infinitely mortifying, the quakers took occa&s;ion to attribute all this mi&s;chief to a judgment on them for their per&s;ecution. A general fa&s;t was appointed; praying God to pardon all the errors of his &s;ervants and people in a late tragedy, rai&s;ed among&s;t them by Satan and his in&s;truments.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t paroxi&s;m of the puritanic enthu&s;ia&s;m in New England. This violent fit carried off &s;o much of that humour, that the people there are now grown &s;omewhat like the re&s;t of mankind in their manners, and have much abated of their per&s;ecuting &s;pirit.</P>
<P>It is not an incurious &s;peculation to con&s;i|der the&s;e remarkable &s;allies of the human mind, out of it's ordinary cour&s;e. Whole na|tions
<PB N="156" REF="158">
are often carried away by what would never influence one man of &s;en&s;e. The cau&s;e is originally weak, and to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with|out great difficulty; but then it's weakne&s;s prevents any &s;u&s;picion of the mi&s;chief, until it is too late to think of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it at all. In &s;uch ca&s;es the more weak, improbable, and incon&s;i&s;tent any &s;tory is, the more powerful and general is it's effect, being helped on by de&s;ign in &s;ome, by folly in others, and kept up by contagion in all. The more extraordinary the de&s;ign, the more dreadful the crime, the le&s;s we examine into the proofs. The charge and the evidence of &s;ome things is the &s;ame. However, in &s;ome time the minds of people cool, and they are a&s;toni&s;hed how they ever came to be &s;o affected.</P>

<P>THE events in the hi&s;tory of New England, their di&s;putes with their go|vernors, the variations in their charters, and their wars with the Indians, afford very little u&s;eful or agreeable matter. In their wars there was very little conduct &s;hewn; and though they prevailed in the end, in a man|ner to the extirpation of that race of people,
<PB N="157" REF="159">
yet the Indians had always great advantages in the beginning; and the mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h to oppo&s;e them, were generally injudiciou&s;ly taken. Their manner too of treating them in the beginning was &s;o indi&s;creet (for it was in general no wor&s;e) as to provoke them as much to tho&s;e wars, as the French influence has done &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>The country which we call New England, is in length &s;omething le&s;s than three hundred miles; at the broade&s;t part it is about two hun|dred, if we carry it on to tho&s;e tracts which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French; but if we regard the part we have &s;ettled, in general, it does not extend any where very much above &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea coa&s;t.</P>
<P>This country lies between the 41&s;t and 45th degrees of North latitude. Though it is &s;ituated almo&s;t ten degrees nearer the &s;un than we are in England, yet the winter begins earlier, la&s;ts longer, and is incom|parably more &s;evere than it is with us. The &s;ummer again is extremely hot, and more fer|vently &s;o than in places which lie under the &s;ame parallels in Europe. However, both the heat and the cold are now far more mo|derate, and the con&s;titution of the air in all re&s;pects far better than our people found it at their fir&s;t &s;ettlement. The clearing away the woods, and the opening the ground every
<PB N="158" REF="160">
where, has, by giving a free pa&s;&s;age to the air, carried off tho&s;e noxious vapours which were &s;o prejudicial to the health of the fir&s;t inhabi|tants. The temper of the &s;ky is generally both in &s;ummer and in winter very &s;teddy and &s;erene. Two months frequently pa&s;s without the appearance of a cloud. Their rains are heavy and &s;oon over.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of New England is various, but be&s;t as you approach the Southward. It affords excellent meadows in the low grounds, and very good pa&s;ture almo&s;t every where. They commonly allot at the rate of two acres to the maintenance of a cow. The meadows which they reckon the be&s;t, yield about a ton of hay by the acre. Some produce two tons, but the hay is rank and &s;our. This country is not very favourable to any of the European kinds of grain. The wheat is &s;ub|ject to be bla&s;ted; the barley is an hungry grain, and the oats are lean and chaffy. But the Indian corn, which makes the general food of the lowe&s;t &s;ort of people, flouri&s;hes here. This, as it is a &s;pecies of grain not &s;o univer&s;ally known in England, and as it is that of all others which yields the greate&s;t increa&s;e, I &s;hall give a &s;hort de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>This plant, which the native Americans call weachin, is known in &s;ome of the South|ern parts of America by the name of maize.
<PB N="159" REF="161">
The ear is about a &s;pan in length, con&s;i&s;ting of eight rows of the corn, or more, according to the goodne&s;s of the ground, with about thirty grains in each row. On the top of the grain hangs a &s;ort of flower, not unlike a ta&s;&s;el of &s;ilk, of various colours, white, blue, greeni&s;h, black, &s;peckled, &s;triped, which gives this corn as it grows a very beautiful appearance. The grain is of all the colours which prevail in the flower, but mo&s;t frequently yellow and white. The &s;talks grow &s;ix or eight feet high, and are of a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s. They are le&s;s high in New England, and other Northern countries, than in Virginia, and tho&s;e which lie more to the Southward. They are jointed like a cane, and at each of the&s;e joints &s;hoot out a number of leaves like flags, that make very good fodder for the cattle. The &s;talk is full of a juice, of which a &s;yrup as &s;weet as &s;ugar has been frequently made.</P>
<P>This grain is generally &s;owed in little &s;quares, and requires a very attentive cultiva|tion. The ground in which it flouri&s;hes mo&s;t is light and &s;andy, with a &s;mall intermixture of loam. About a peck of &s;eed is &s;ufficient for an acre, which at a medium produces about twenty-five bu&s;hels. The New England peo|ple not only make bread of this grain, but they malt and brew it into a beer, which is not contemptible. However, the greater part of their beer is made of mola&s;&s;es, hopped; with
<PB N="160" REF="162">
the addition &s;ometimes of the tops of the &s;pruce fir infu&s;ed.</P>
<P>They rai&s;e in New England, be&s;ides this and other &s;pecies of grain, a large quantity of flax, and have made e&s;&s;ays upon hemp, that have been far from un&s;ucce&s;sful. An acre of their Cow-pen land produces about a ton of this commodity; but the land is pretty &s;oon exhau&s;|ted. This plant probably requires a climate more uniformly warm than New England; for though the greater part of our hemp is brought to us from Northern ports, yet it is in the more Southerly provinces of Ru&s;&s;ia, that the be&s;t which comes to our market is produced.</P>
<P>Their horned cattle are very numerous in New England, and &s;ome of them very large. Oxen have been killed there of eighteen hun|dred weight. Hogs likewi&s;e are numerous, and particularly excellent; and &s;ome &s;o large as to weigh twenty-five &s;core. They have be&s;ides, a breed of &s;mall hor&s;es, which are ex|tremely hardy. They pace naturally, though in no very graceful or ea&s;y manner, but with &s;uch &s;wiftne&s;s, and for &s;o long a continuance, as mu&s;t appear almo&s;t incredible to tho&s;e who have not experienced it. They have a great number of &s;heep too, and of a good kind. The wool is of a &s;taple &s;ufficiently long, but it is not near &s;o fine as that of England. How|ever, they manufacture a great deal of it very &s;ucce&s;sfully. I have &s;een cloths made there,
<PB N="161" REF="163">
which were of as clo&s;e and firm a contexture, tho' not &s;o fine, as our be&s;t drabs; they were thick, and, as far as I could judge, &s;uperior for the ordinary wear of country people, to any thing we make in England.</P>

<P>THERE are in this country many gen|tlemen of con&s;iderable landed e&s;tates, which they let to farmers, or manage by their &s;tewards or over&s;eers; but the greater part of the people is compo&s;ed of a &s;ub&s;tantial yeo|manry who cultivate their own freeholds, without a dependence upon any but provi|dence and their own indu&s;try. The&s;e free|holds generally pa&s;s to their children in the way of gavelkind; which keeps them from being almo&s;t ever able to emerge out of their original happy mediocrity. This manner of inheriting has here an additional good effect. It makes the people the more ready to go backward into the uncultivated parts of the country, where land is to be had at an ea&s;y rate and in larger portions. The people by their being generally freeholders, and by their form of go|vernment, have a very free, bold, and republican &s;pirit. In no part of the world are the ordinary &s;ort &s;o independent, or po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many of the conveniencies of life; they are u&s;ed from
<PB N="162" REF="164">
their infancy to the exerci&s;e of arms; and they have a militia, which for a militia is by no means contemptible; and certainly if the&s;e men were &s;omewhat more regularly trained, and in better &s;ubordination, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to find in any country, or in any time ancient or modern, an army better con&s;tituted than that which New England can furni&s;h. This too is much the be&s;t peopled of any of our colonies upon the continent. It is judged that the four provinces which it compri&s;es, contain about three hundred and fifty thou|&s;and &s;ouls, including a very &s;mall number of blacks and Indians; the re&s;t are whites. Dougla&s;s, who &s;eems to be well informed in this point, proportions them as follows,

<P>The&s;e four governments are confederated for their common defence. We have &s;hewn how the&s;e &s;everal governments have ari&s;en. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them for riches and number of people, though not for extent of territorry, is Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets bay. This pro|vince like the others had originally a power of
<PB N="163" REF="165">
chu&s;ing every one of their own magi&s;trates; the governor, the council, the a&s;&s;embly,&mdash;all; and of making &s;uch laws as they thought pro|per, without &s;ending them home for the ap|probation of the crown. But being accu&s;ed of having abu&s;ed this freedom, in the latter end of the reign of Charles the &s;econd, they were deprived of it by a judgment in a <HI>quo warranto</HI> in the king's bench in England. They remained from that time to the revolu|tion without any charter. Some time after the revolution they received a new one, which though very favourable, was much inferior to the exten&s;ive privileges of the former charter, which indeed were too exten&s;ive for a colo|ny, and what left little more than a nominal dependence on the mother country, and the crown it&s;elf. But now, the governor, lieu|tenant governor, and the chief places of the law and in the revenue, are in the di&s;po&s;al of the crown; &s;o is the militia; and tho' the coun|cil is cho&s;en by the repre&s;entatives of the people, yet the governor has a negative which gives him an influence, &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the prerogative entire. Appeals for &s;ums above three hundred pounds are admitted to the king and council, and all laws pa&s;&s;ed here mu&s;t be remitted to England; where if they do not receive a negative from the crown in three years, they are to be con&s;idered as valid, and are to have the effect of laws; which they
<PB N="164" REF="166">
are to have likewi&s;e until the time that the king's re&s;olution is known. But one point has been long and re&s;olutely di&s;puted in this colony; the grant of a certain &s;alary to their governor. Many attempts have been made to induce them to this mea&s;ure; but to no effect. They think a dependence on the people for his &s;alary the mo&s;t effectual method of re|&s;training the governor from any unpopular acts. To the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets government is united the ancient colony of Plymouth, and the territory which is called Main.</P>
<P>The colony of Connecticut, which lies upon a river of the &s;ame name to the South of this province, has pre&s;erved it's ancient privileges, which are now as con&s;iderable as tho&s;e of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets were formerly. At the time that the charter of the former was attack|ed, that of this government was threatened with the &s;ame fate. But they agreed to &s;ub|mit to the king's plea&s;ure; therefore, no judgment was given again&s;t them; and being found in this condition at the revolution, it was judged that they were in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their old charter, and have &s;o continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The third and &s;malle&s;t of the provinces which compo&s;e New England, is Rhode I&s;land. This con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall i&s;land of that name, and the old plantation of Providence. The&s;e united plantations had a charter the &s;ame with that of Connecticut, and they have
<PB N="165" REF="167">
pre&s;erved it by the &s;ame method. In this province is an unlimited freedom of religion, agreeable to the fir&s;t principles of it's founda|tion; and though very &s;mall, it is from thence extremely well peopled.</P>
<P>New Hamp&s;hire, the fourth province, is much the large&s;t of them all; but not inha|bited in proportion. This is more Northerly for the greater part than any of the re&s;t. It is a royal government; that is, the crown has the nomination of all the officers of ju&s;tice and of the militia, and the appointment of the council.</P>

<P>THERE is not one of our &s;ettlements which can be compared in the abun|dance of people, the number of con&s;iderable and trading towns, and the manufactures that are carried on in them, to New England. The mo&s;t populous and flouri&s;hing parts of the mother country hardly make a better ap|pearance. Our provinces to the Southward on this continent are recommendable for the generous warmth of the climate, and a luxu|riance of &s;oil which naturally throws up a va&s;t variety of beautiful and rich vegetable produc|tions; but New England is the fir&s;t in Ame|rica, for cultivation, for the number of people, and for the order which re&s;ults from both.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="168">Though there are in all the provinces of New England large towns which drive a con|&s;iderable trade, the only one which can de&s;erve to be much in&s;i&s;ted upon in a de&s;ign like ours, is Bo&s;ton; the capital of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;et's bay, the fir&s;t city of New England, and of all North America. This city is &s;ituated on a penin&s;ula, at the bottom of a fine capaci|ous and &s;afe harbour, which is defended from the outrages of the &s;ea, by a number of i&s;lands, and rocks which appear above water. It is entered but by one &s;afe pa&s;&s;age; and that is narrow, and covered by the cannon of a regu|lar and very &s;trong fortre&s;s. The harbour is more than &s;ufficient for the great number of ve&s;&s;els, which carry on the exten&s;ive trade of Bo&s;ton. At the bottom of the bay is a noble pier, near two thou&s;and feet in length, along which on the North &s;ide extends a row of warehou&s;es. The head of this pier joins the principal &s;treet of the town, which is, like mo&s;t of the others, &s;pacious and well built. The town lies at the bottom of the harbour, and forms a very agreeable view. It has a town hou&s;e, where the courts meet, and the exchange is kept, large, and of a very tolerable ta&s;te of architecture. Round the exchange, are a great number of well furni&s;hed book&s;el|lers &s;hops, which find employment for five printing pre&s;&s;es. There are ten churches within this town; and it contains at lea&s;t twenty thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">That we may be enabled to form &s;ome judgment of the wealth of this city, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that from Chri&s;tmas 1747, to Chri&s;t|mas 1748, five hundred ve&s;&s;els cleared out, from this port only, for a foreign trade; and four hundred and thirty were entered inwards; to &s;ay nothing of coa&s;ting and fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, both of which are extremely numerous, and &s;aid to be equal in number to the others. In|deed the trade of New England is great, as it &s;upplies a large quantity of goods from within it&s;elf; but it is yet greater, as the people of this country are in a manner the carriers for all the colonies of North America and the We&s;t-Indies, and even for &s;ome parts of Europe. They may be con&s;idered in this re&s;pect as the Dutch of America.</P>
<P>The commodities which the country yields are principally ma&s;ts and yards, for which they contract largely with the royal navy; pitch, tar and turpentine; &s;taves, lumber, boards, all &s;orts of provi&s;ions, beef, pork, butter and chee&s;e, in large quantities; hor&s;es and live cattle; Indian corn and pea&s;e; cyder, apples, hemp and flax. Their peltry trade is not very con&s;iderable. The have a very noble cod fi&s;hery upon their coa&s;t, which employs a va&s;t number of their people; they are ena|bled by this to export annually above thirty-two thou&s;and quintals of choice cod fi&s;h, to Spain, Italy, and the Mediterranean, and
<PB N="168" REF="170">
about nineteen thou&s;and quintals of the refu&s;e &s;ort to the We&s;t-Indies, as food for the negroes. The quantity of &s;pirits, which they di&s;til in Bo&s;ton from the mola&s;&s;es they bring in from all parts of the We&s;t-Indies, is as &s;urpri&s;ing as the cheap rare at which they vend it, which is under two &s;hillings a gallon. With this they &s;upply almo&s;t all the con&s;umption of our colonies in North America, the In|dian trade there, the va&s;t demands of their own and the Newfoundland fi&s;hery, and in great mea&s;ure tho&s;e of the African trade; but they are more famous for the quantity and cheapne&s;s, than for the excellency of their rum.</P>
<P>They are almo&s;t the only one of our colo|nies which have much of the woollen and linen manufactures. Of the former they have nearly as much as &s;uffices for their own cloath|ings. It is a clo&s;e and &s;trong, but a coar&s;e &s;tubborn &s;ort of cloth. A number of pre&s;|byterians from the North of Ireland, driven thence, as it is &s;aid, by the &s;everity of their landlords, from an affinity in religious &s;enti|ments cho&s;e New England as their place of refuge. Tho&s;e people brought with them their &s;kill in the linen manufactures, and meet|ing very large encouragement, they exerci&s;ed it to the great advantage of this colony. At pre&s;ent they make large quantities, and of a very good kind; their principal &s;ettlement is
<PB N="169" REF="171">
in a town, which in compliment to them is called Londonderry. Hats are made in New England which in a clande&s;tine way find a good vent in all the other colonies. The &s;etting up the&s;e manufactures has been in a great mea|&s;ure a matter nece&s;&s;ary to them; for as they have not been properly encouraged in &s;ome &s;taple commodity, by which they might com|municate with their mother country, while they were cut off from all other re&s;ources, they mu&s;t either have abandoned the country, or have found means of employing their own &s;kill and indu&s;try to draw out of it the nece&s;|&s;aries of life. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, together with their convenience for building and man|ning &s;hips, has made them the carriers for the other colonies.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;hip-building is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable which Bo&s;ton or the other &s;ea-port towns in New England carry on. Ships are &s;ometimes built here upon commi&s;|&s;ion; but frequently, the merchants of New England have them con&s;tructed upon their own account; and loading them with the pro|duce of the colony, naval &s;tores, fi&s;h, and fi&s;h-oil principally, they &s;end them out upon a tra|ding voyage to Spain, Portugal, or the Mediter|ranean, where having di&s;po&s;ed of their cargo, they make what advantage they can by freight, until &s;uch time as they can &s;ell the ve&s;&s;el her&s;elf to advantage; which they &s;eldom fail
<PB N="170" REF="172">
to do in a rea&s;onable time. They receive the value of the ve&s;&s;el, as well as of the freight of the goods, which from time to time they car|ried, and of the cargo with which they &s;ailed originally, in bills of exchange upon London; for as the people of New England have no commodity to return for the value of above a hundred thou&s;and pounds, which they take in various &s;orts of goods from England, but &s;ome naval &s;tores, and tho&s;e in no great quan|tities, they are obliged to keep the ballance &s;omewhat even by this circuitous commerce, which though not carried on with Great Britain, nor with Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, yet centers init's pro|fits, where all the money which the colonies can make in any manner, mu&s;t center at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I know that complaints have been made of this trade, principally becau&s;e the people of New England, not &s;atisfied with carrying out their own produce, become carriers for the other colonies, particularly for Virginia and Maryland, from whom they take tobacco, which, in contempt of the act of navigation, they carry directly to the foreign market. Where, not having the duty and accumulated charges to which the Briti&s;h merchant is liable to pay, they in a manner wholly out him of the trade. Again, our &s;ugar colonies com|plain as loudly, that the va&s;t trade which New England drives in lumber, live &s;tock and provi&s;ions with the French and Dutch
<PB N="171" REF="173">
&s;ugar i&s;lands, particularly with the former, enables the&s;e i&s;lands, together with the inter|nal advantages they po&s;&s;e&s;s, greatly to under|&s;ell the Engli&s;h plantations. That the returns which the people of New England make from the&s;e i&s;lands being in &s;ugar, or the pro|ductions of &s;ugar, &s;yrups and mola&s;&s;es, the rum which is thence di&s;tilled prevents the &s;ale of our We&s;t-India rum. That this trade proves doubly di&s;advantageous to our &s;ugar i&s;lands; fir&s;t, as it enables the French to &s;ell their &s;ugars cheaper than they could other|wi&s;e afford to do; and then, as it finds them a market for their mola&s;&s;es, and other refu&s;e of &s;ugars, for which otherwi&s;e they could find no market at all; becau&s;e rum interferes with brandy, a con&s;iderable manufacture of Old France.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations were the ground of a complaint made by the i&s;lands to the legi&s;la|ture in England &s;ome years ago. They de&s;ired that the exportation of lumber, &amp;c. to the French colonies, and the importation of &s;u|gars and mola&s;&s;es from thence, might be entirely prohibited. This was undoubtedly a very nice point to &s;ettle. On one hand, the growth of the French We&s;t-Indies was mani|fe&s;t and alarming, and it was not to be thought that the French would ever wink at this trade, if it had not been of the greate&s;t ad|vantage to them. On the other hand, the
<PB N="172" REF="174">
Northern colonies declared, that if they were deprived of &s;o great a branch of their trade, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;itate them to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of manufactures. For if they were cut off from their foreign trade, they never could purcha&s;e in England the many things for the u&s;e or the ornament of life, which they have from thence. Be&s;ides this, the French deprived of the provi&s;ion and lumber of New England, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity take every mea&s;ure to be &s;upplied from their own colonies, which would an&s;wer their purpo&s;es better, if they could accompli&s;h it, at the &s;ame time that it would deprive the New England people of a large and profitable branch of their trade.</P>
<P>The&s;e points, and many more, were fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed upon both &s;ides. The legi&s;lature took a middle cour&s;e. They did not entirely pro|hibit the carrying of lumber to the French i&s;lands, but they laid a con&s;iderable duty upon whatever rum, &s;ugars, or mola&s;&s;es they &s;hould import from thence, to enhance by this means the price of lumber, and other nece&s;&s;aries to the French, and by laying them under diffi|culties, to &s;et the Engli&s;h &s;ugar plantations in &s;ome mea&s;ure upon an equal footing with theirs.</P>
<P>This was undoubtedly a very prudent regu|lation. For though it was urged, that the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi navigation was &s;o bad, that there was no pro&s;pect that the French could ever
<PB N="173" REF="175">
be &s;upplied with lumber and provi&s;ions from thence; and that there were no &s;nows in Loui&s;iana, the melting of which might facili|tate the tran&s;portation of lumber into that river, yet it was by no means &s;afe to tru&s;t to that, &s;o as utterly to de&s;troy a trade of our own, which employed &s;o much &s;hipping, and &s;o many &s;ailors. Becau&s;e we have a thou&s;and in&s;tances, wherein the driving people to the la&s;t &s;treights, and putting them under the tuition of &s;uch a ma&s;ter as ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity, has taught them inventions, and excited them to an indu&s;try, which have compa&s;&s;ed things as much regretted at la&s;t, as they were unfore&s;een at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Though no great &s;nows fall in the South|ern parts of Loui&s;iana, yet to the Northward a great deal falls, and not only the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, but the number of other great rivers which it receives overflow annually, and they can be in no want of timber convenient enough to navigation. And though the pa&s;&s;age to the French i&s;lands be for &s;uch a great way to the windward, as to bring them the&s;e commodi|ties in a more tedious manner, and at a dearer rate, is it not much better that they &s;hould have them cheap from us than dear from them&s;elves? Nor perhaps would even this difficulty, which is indeed much le&s;s than it is repre&s;ented, bring down the French to the par of our &s;ugar colonies, loaded as they are
<PB N="174" REF="176">
with taxes, groaning under the pre&s;&s;ure of many grievances, and deformed by an infinite multitude of abu&s;es and enormities; nor can they with rea&s;on or ju&s;tice hope for a cure of the evils which they &s;uffer, partly from errors of their own, and partly from mi&s;takes in England, at the expence of the trade of their &s;i&s;ter colonies on the continent of America, who are entirely guiltle&s;s of their &s;ufferings; nor is it by re&s;traints on their trade, but by an effectual and judicious encouragement of their own, that they can hope to remedy the&s;e evils, and rival the French e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>The French, in permitting us to &s;upply them, it is true, give us a proof that they have advantages from this trade; but this is no proof at all that we derive none from it; for on that &s;uppo&s;ition no trade could be mutually beneficial. Nor is it at all certain, as it has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that if we left their refu&s;e of &s;u|gars upon their hands, that they could turn them to no profit. If the council of com|merce could be made to &s;ee di&s;tinctly that this trade could not prejudice the &s;ale of their brandy, and would only make the trade of rum change hands, as the ca&s;e probably would be; and if they could &s;hew, as they might, what a lo&s;s it mu&s;t be to them entirely to throw away a con&s;iderable part of the produce of their lands, and which was formerly &s;o valu|able
<PB N="175" REF="177">
to them, there is no doubt but the court would give &s;ufficient encouragement to their own plantations to di&s;til rum, and to vend it in &s;uch a manner as might the lea&s;t preju|dice the brandies of France; and then, in|&s;tead of &s;ending us mola&s;&s;es, as they could di|&s;til the &s;pirit far cheaper than our i&s;lands, they would &s;end us the &s;pirit it&s;elf; and we may know by experience, e&s;pecially in that part of the world, how in&s;ufficient all regulations are to prevent a counterband, which would be &s;o gainful to particulars.</P>
<P>After all, are we certain, that the French would tru&s;t for the &s;upply of their i&s;lands to Loui&s;iana, or to the precarious &s;upplies from Canada? would they not redouble their appli|cation, now made nece&s;&s;ary, to Cape Breton? what experiments would they not make in Cayenne for the timber trade? they would certainly try every method, and probably would &s;ucceed in &s;ome of their trials. Re|&s;traints upon trade are nice things; and ought to be well con&s;idered. Great care ought to be taken in all &s;uch, how we &s;acrifice the in|tere&s;ts of one part of our territories to tho&s;e of another; and it would be a mi&s;take of the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equence, if we came to think that the &s;hipping, &s;eamen, commodities, or wealth of the Briti&s;h colonies were not effec|tually the &s;hipping, &s;eamen, and wealth of Great Britain her&s;elf. Sentiments of another kind have frequently done us mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">The general plan of our management with regard to the trade of our colonies, methinks, ought to be, to encourage in every one of them &s;ome &s;eparate and di&s;tinct articles, &s;uch as not interfering, might enable them to trade with each other, and all to trade to advantage with their mother country. And then, where we have rivals in any branch of the trade carried on by our colonies, to enable them to &s;end their goods to the foreign market directly; u&s;ing at the &s;ame time the wi&s;e precaution which the French put in practice, to make the &s;hips &s;o employed take the Engli&s;h ports in their way home; for our great danger is, that they &s;hould in that ca&s;e make their returns in foreign manufactures, again&s;t which we can|not guard too carefully. This, and that they &s;hould not go largely into manufactures inter|fering with ours, ought to be the only points at which our re&s;trictions &s;hould aim. The&s;e purpo&s;es ought not to be compa&s;&s;ed by ab&s;o|lute prohibitions and penalties, which would be unpolitical and unju&s;t, but by the way of diver&s;ion, by encouraging them to fall into &s;uch things as find a demand with our&s;elves at home. By this means Great Britain and all it's dependencies will have a common intere&s;t, they will mutually play into each other's hands, and the trade &s;o di&s;per&s;ed, will be of infinitely more advantage to us, than if all it's &s;everal articles were produced and manu|factured within our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179">I venture on the&s;e hints concerning re|&s;traints on trade, becau&s;e in fact that of New England rather wants to be &s;upported than to be checked by &s;uch re&s;traints. It's trade in many of it's branches is clearly on the decline; and this circum&s;tance ought to intere&s;t us deeply; for very valuable is this colony, if it never &s;ent us any thing, nor took any thing from us, as it is the grand barrier of all the re&s;t; and as it is the principal magazine which &s;upplies our We&s;t-Indies, from whence we draw &s;uch va&s;t advantages. That this valu|able colony is far from advancing, will appear clearly from the &s;tate of one of the principal branches of it's trade, that of &s;hip-building, for four years. In the year 1738 they built at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ton forty-one top&s;ail ve&s;&s;els, burthen in all 6324 tons; in 1743 only thirty; in 46 but twenty; in 49 they were reduced to fifteen, making in the whole but 2450 tons of &s;hip|ping; in &s;uch a time an a&s;toni&s;hing declen&s;ion! How it has been &s;ince I have not &s;ufficient information; but allowing that the decline has cea&s;ed here, yet this is &s;urely &s;ufficient to &s;et us upon the nice&s;t enquiry into the cau&s;e of that decay, and the mo&s;t effectual mea|&s;ures to retrieve the affairs of &s;o valuable a province; particularly, if by any ill-judged or ill-intended &s;chemes, or by any mi&s;government this mi&s;chief has happened them.</P>

<P>IT is not certainly known at what time the Swedes and Dutch made their fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in North America; but it was cer|tainly po&s;terior to our &s;ettlement of Virginia, and prior to that of New England. The Swedes, who were no con&s;iderable naval pow|er, had hardly fixt the rudiments of a colony there than they de&s;erted it. The inhabitants, without protection or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were glad to enter into a coalition with the Dutch that had &s;ettled there upon a better plan, and to &s;ubmit to the government of the States. The wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters"> tract po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or claimed by the two nations, who&s;e two colonies were now grown into one, extended from the 38th to the 41&s;t degree of latitude, all along the &s;ea coa&s;t. They called it Nova Belgia, or New Netherlands. It con|tinued in their hands until the reign of Charles the &s;econd. The Dutch war then breaking out, in the year 1664 Sir Robert Car with three thou&s;and men was &s;ent to reduce it, which he did with &s;o little re&s;i&s;tance, as not to gain him any great honour by the conque&s;t. A little after, the Dutch by way of repri&s;al fell upon our colony of Surinam in South
<PB N="179" REF="181">
America, and conquered it after much the &s;ame oppo&s;ition that we met in the New Netherlands. By the treaty of peace which was &s;igned at Breda, in 1667, it was agreed that things &s;hould remain in the &s;tate they were at that time; Surinam to the Dutch, the New Netherlands to the Engli&s;h. At that time, this was looked upon by many as a bad exchange; but it now appears, that we have made an excellent bargain; for to &s;ay nothing of the great di&s;advantage of having our colo|nies, as it were, cut-in two by the intervention of a foreign territory; this is now one of the be&s;t peopled and riche&s;t parts of our planta|tions, extremely u&s;eful to the others, and mak|ing very valuable returns to the mother coun|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">, whereas Surinam is comparatively a place of very &s;mall con&s;equence, very unheal|thy, and by no art to be made otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The New Netherlands were not long in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, before they were divided into di&s;tinct provinces, and laid a&s;ide their former appellation. The North-Ea&s;t part which joined New England, was called New York, in compliment to the duke of York, who had at fir&s;t the grant of the whole territory. This province runs up to the Northward on both &s;ides of the river Hud&s;on, for about two hun|dred miles into the country of the Five na|tions or Iroquois; but it is not in any part
<PB N="180" REF="182">
above forty or fifty miles wide. It compre|hends within it's limits Long I&s;land, which lies to the South of Connecticut, and is an i&s;land inferior to no part of America in excellent ground for the pa&s;turage of hor&s;es, oxen, and &s;heep, or the plentiful produce of every &s;ort of grain.</P>
<P>The part of Nova Belgia, which lay along the ocean, between that and the river Dela|war, from the Southern part of New York quite down to Maryland, was granted to Sir George Carteret and others, and called New Jer&s;ey from him, becau&s;e he had, as the fami|ly &s;till has, e&s;tates in the i&s;land of that name. This province is bounded upon the We&s;t by the river Delawar, which divides it from Pen&s;ylvania. It is in length about one hun|dred and fifty miles, or thereabouts, and about fifty in breadth.</P>
<P>Pen&s;ylvania, which lies between New York, New Jer&s;ey, and Maryland, and only commu|nicates with the &s;ea by the mouth of the river Delawar, is in length about two hundred and fifty miles; and in breadth two hundred. This territory was granted to the famous Mr. William Pen, the &s;on of Sir William Pen the admiral, in the year 1680.</P>
<P>The climate and &s;oil in the three provinces of New York, New Jer&s;ey, and Pen&s;ylvania, admits of no very remarkable difference.
<PB N="181" REF="183">
In all the&s;e, and indeed in all our North American colonies, the land near the &s;ea is in general low, flat, and mar&s;hy; at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;ea it &s;wells into little hills, and then into great even ridges of mountains, which hold their cour&s;e for the mo&s;t part, North-Ea&s;t, and South-We&s;t. The &s;oil throughout the&s;e three provinces is in general extremely fruitful; abounding not only in it's native grain the Indian corn, but in all &s;uch as have been naturalized there from Europe. Wheat in &s;uch abundance, and of &s;o excellent a quality, that few parts of the world, for the tract which is cultivated, exceed it in the one or the other of the&s;e particu|lars, nor in barley, oats, rye, buck-wheat, and every &s;ort of grain which we have here. They have a great number of horned cattle, hor&s;es, &s;heep, and hogs. All our European poultry abound there; game of all kinds is wonder|fully plenty; deer of &s;everal &s;pecies; hares of a kind peculiar to America, but inferior in reli&s;h to ours; wild turkies of a va&s;t &s;ize, and equal goodne&s;s; a beautiful &s;pecies of phea&s;ants only found in this country. Every &s;pecies of herbs or roots which we force in our gardens, grow here with great ea&s;e; and every &s;pecies of fruit; but &s;ome, as tho&s;e of peaches and melons, in far greater perfection.</P>
<P>Their fore&s;ts abound in excellent timber, the oak, the a&s;h, the beech, the che&s;nut, the
<PB N="182" REF="184">
cedar, the walnut, the cypre&s;s, the hic kory, the &s;a&s;&s;afras, and the pine. In all parts of our plantations, comprehending New York to the Northward, quite to the Southern extre|mity, the woods are full of wild vines of three or four &s;pecies, all different from tho&s;e we have in Europe. But whether from &s;ome fault in their nature, or in the climate, or the &s;oil where they grow, or, what is much more probable, from a fault in the planters, they have yet produced no wine that de|&s;erves to be mentioned. It may be re|marked in general of the timber of the&s;e pro|vinces, that it is not &s;o good for &s;hipping as that of New England and Nova Scotia. The further Southward you go, the timber becomes le&s;s compact, and rives ea&s;ily; which proper|ty, as it makes it more u&s;eful for &s;taves, ren|ders it le&s;s &s;erviceable for &s;hips.</P>
<P>They rai&s;e in all the&s;e provinces, but much the mo&s;t largely in Pen&s;ylvania, great quan|tities of flax; and hemp is a promi&s;ing article. Nor are they deficient in minerals. In New York a good deal of iron is found. In New Jer&s;ey a very rich copper mine has been opened. There is no manner of doubt but in time, when the people come to multiply &s;uf|ficiently, and experience and want have made them ingenious in opening re&s;ources for trade, the&s;e colonies will become as remarkable for u&s;eful metals as they now are for grain. The&s;e three provinces, as are all tho&s;e we have in
<PB N="183" REF="185">
North America, are extremely well watered. They have however ob&s;erved in New Eng|land, that as they clear the country, a va&s;t number of little brooks are quite lo&s;t, and the mills upon them by this lo&s;s rendered u&s;ele&s;s. They even ob&s;erve, that this cutting down the woods has affected the river Connecticut it&s;elf, the large&s;t in New England, and that it has grown di&s;tingui&s;hably &s;hallower. I do not know whether the &s;ame remark has been made in Pen&s;ylvania and New York. But whatever they have lo&s;t in water, which, where there is &s;uch a plenty, is no great lo&s;s, has been amply compen&s;ated by the great &s;alubrity of the air, which has ari&s;en from the cultivation of the country. At pre&s;ent tho&s;e I de&s;cribe are for the greater part as healthv as can be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>As the climate and &s;oil of the provinces of New York, New Jer&s;ey, and Pen&s;ylvania, are with a very little difference the &s;ame, &s;o there is no difference in the commodities in which they trade, which are wheat, flour, barley, oats, Indian corn, peas, beef, pork, chee&s;e, butter, cyder, beer, flax, hemp and flax-&s;eed, lin&s;eed oil, furs and deer-&s;kins, &s;taves, lumber, and iron. Their markets are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which the people of New England u&s;e; and the&s;e colonies have a &s;hare in the logwood trade, and that which is carried on with the Spani&s;h and French plantations.</P>

<P>THE province of New York has two cities; the fir&s;t is called by the name of the province it&s;elf. It was denominated New Am&s;terdam when the Dutch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, but it has changed it's name along with it's ma&s;ters. This city is mo&s;t commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade, upon an excellent harbour, in an i&s;land called Manahatton, about four|teen miles long, and four or five broad. This i&s;land lies ju&s;t in the mouth of the river Hud&s;on, which di&s;charges it&s;elf here after a long cour&s;e. This is one of the noble&s;t rivers in America. It is navigable upwards of two hundred miles. The tide flows one hun|dred and fifty.</P>
<P>The city of New York contains near twelve hundred hou&s;es, and between &s;even and eight thou&s;and inhabitants, the de&s;cen|dants of Dutch and Engli&s;h. It is well and commodiou&s;ly built, and has a very good a&s;pect from the &s;ea; but is by no means properly fortified. There is no hou&s;e in New York worth le&s;s than one hundred pounds &s;terling, &s;o that there is in no part the lea&s;t appearance of poverty or meanne&s;s. There is one large church built for the church of England wor&s;hip; and three others, a Dutch,
<PB N="185" REF="187">
a French, and a Lutheran. The town has a very flouri&s;hing trade, and in which great profits are made. The merchants are wealthy, and the people in general mo&s;t comfortably provided for, and with a moderate labour. From the year 1749 to 1750 two hundred and thirty-two ve&s;&s;els have been entered in this port, and two hundred and eighty-&s;ix cleared outwards. In the&s;e ve&s;&s;els were &s;hipped &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirty one tons of provi&s;ions, chiefly flour, and a va&s;t quan|tity of grain; of which I have no particular account. The inhabitants of this colony are about eighty thou&s;and. They are an ho&s;pitable people, and fond of &s;trangers. There is here a general toleration of all religious per&s;ua|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;ame river Hud&s;on, about one hundred and fifty miles from New York is Albany; a town of not &s;o much note for it's number of hou&s;es or inhabitants, as for the great trade which is carried on with the In|dians, and indeed by connivance with the French for the u&s;e of the &s;ame people. This trade takes off a great quantity of coar&s;e woollen goods, &s;uch as &s;trouds and duffils; and with the&s;e, guns, hatchets, knives, hoes, kettles, powder and &s;hot; be&s;ides &s;hirts and cloaths ready made, and &s;everal other articles. Here it is that the treaties and other tran&s;ac|tions
<PB N="186" REF="188">
between us and the Iroquois Indians are negotiated.</P>
<P>This nation, or combination of Five nations, united by an ancient and inviolable league among&s;t them&s;elves, were the olde&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;teddy, and mo&s;t effectual ally we have found among&s;t the Indians. This people, by their unanimity, firmne&s;s, military &s;kill, and policy, have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to be the greate&s;t and mo&s;t formidable power in all America; they have reduced a va&s;t number of nations, and brought under their power a territory twice as large as the kingdom of France; but they have not increa&s;ed their &s;ubjects in proportion. As their manner of warring is implacable and barbarous, they reign the lords of a prodigious de&s;art, inhabited only by a few &s;cattered in|&s;ignificant tribes, whom they have permitted to live out of a contempt of their power, and who are all in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of &s;ubjection. And yet this once mighty and victorious nation, though it has always u&s;ed the policy of incor|porating with it&s;elf a great many of the pri|&s;oners they make in war, is in a very declining condition. About &s;ixty years ago it was computed, that they had ten thou&s;and fighting men; at this day they cannot rai&s;e upwards of fifteen hundred. So much have wars, epi|demical di&s;ea&s;es, and the unnatural union of the vices of civilized nations with the manners
<PB N="187" REF="189">
of &s;avages, reduced this numerous people. But they are not only much le&s;&s;ened at this day in their numbers, but in their di&s;po&s;ition to employ what numbers they have left in our &s;ervice. Among&s;t other neglects, which I have no plea&s;ure in mentioning, and no hopes of &s;eeing amended, this of inattention, or wor&s;e treatment of the Indians, is one, and a capital one. The Iroquois have lately had a &s;ixth nation added to their confederacy, that of the Tu&s;caroras, who fled from our pro|vince of Carolina, being chaced from thence in a war with the Engli&s;h. The&s;e they have received into the league, and the whole con|federacy &s;eems more inclined to the French intere&s;t than ours.</P>

<P>NEW Jer&s;ey, by the perpetual di&s;putes which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the people and the proprietaries, whil&s;t it continued a pro|prietary government, was kept for a long time in a very feeble &s;tate; but within a few years it has begun to reap &s;ome of the advan|tages which it might have had earlier from the proper management of &s;o fine a province and &s;o advantageous a &s;ituation. They rai&s;e very great quantities of grain at pre&s;ent, and are increa&s;ed to near &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ouls; but
<PB N="188" REF="190">
they have yet no town of any con&s;equence. Perth Amboy, which is their capital, has not upwards of two hundred hou&s;es; and though this town has a very fine harbour, capable of receiving and &s;ecuring &s;hips of great burthen, yet as the people of New Jer&s;ey have been u&s;ed to &s;end their produce to the markets of New York and Philadelphia, to which they are contiguous, they find it hard, as it always is in &s;uch ca&s;es, to draw the trade out of the old channel; for there the corre&s;pondences are fixed, the method of dealing e&s;tabli&s;hed, cre|dits given, and a ready market for needy deal|ers, who in all countries are &s;ufficiently nu|merous; &s;o that the trade of this town, which is the only town of any trade worth notice in New Jer&s;ey, is &s;till incon&s;iderable; in the year 1751, only forty-one ve&s;&s;els have entered in|wards, and only thirty-eight cleared out, in which were exported &s;ix thou&s;and four hun|dred and twenty-four barrels of flour; one hundred and &s;ixty-eight thou&s;and weight of bread; three hundred and fourteen barrels of beef and pork; &s;eventeen thou&s;and nine hun|dred and forty-one bu&s;hels of grain, fourteen thou&s;and weight of hemp, with &s;ome butter, hams, beer, flax-&s;eed, bar-iron, and lumber.</P>

<P>I Find it of late a notion pretty current, that proprietary governments are a &s;ort of check to the growth of the colonies which they &s;uperintend. It is certain, that abu&s;es have been, and &s;till do &s;ub&s;i&s;t in that &s;pecies of government; and abu&s;es of as bad a kind may, I believe, be found by per&s;ons of no great penetration in all our governments; but if there were any truth in this ob&s;ervation, the province of Pen&s;ylvania would prove an illu&s;trious exception to it.</P>
<P>William Pen in his capacity of a divine, and of a moral writer, is certainly not of the fir&s;t rank; and his works are of no great e&s;tima|tion, except among&s;t his own people; but in his capacity of a legi&s;lator, and the founder of &s;o flouri&s;hing a commonwealth, he de&s;erves great honour among&s;t all mankind; a com|monwealth, which in the &s;pace of about &s;e|venty years, from a beginning of a few hun|dreds of refugees and indigent men, has grown to be a numerous and flouri&s;hing peo|ple; a people who from a perfect wilderne&s;s have brought their territory to a &s;tate of great cultivation, and filled it with wealthy and po|pulous towns; and who in the mid&s;t of a fierce and lawle&s;s race of men, have pre&s;erved them|&s;elves with unarmed hands and pa&s;&s;ive princi|ples,
<PB N="190" REF="192">
by the rules of moderation and ju&s;tice, better than any other people has done by po|licy and arms. For Mr. Pen, when for his father's &s;ervices, and by his own intere&s;t at court, he obtained the inheritance of this country and it's government, &s;aw that he could make the grant of value to him only by mak|ing the country as agreeable to all people, as ea&s;e and good government could make it. To this purpo&s;e he began by purcha&s;ing the &s;oil, at a very low rate indeed, from the original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, to whom it was of little u&s;e. By this cheap act of ju&s;tice at the beginning, he made all his dealings for the future the more ea&s;y, by prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Indians with a favou|rable opinion of him and his de&s;igns. The other part of his plan, which was to people this country, after he had &s;ecured the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of it, he &s;aw much facilitated by the un|ea&s;ine&s;s of his brethren the quakers in Eng|land, who refu&s;ing to pay tythes and other church dues, &s;uffered a great deal from the &s;piritual courts. Their high opinion of and re|gard for the man who was an honour to their new church, made them the more ready to follow him over the va&s;t ocean into an untried climate and country. Neither was he him|&s;elf wanting in any thing which could encou|rage them. For he expended large &s;ums in tran&s;porting and finding them in all nece&s;&s;aries and not aiming at a hidden profit, he di&s;po&s;|ed
<PB N="191" REF="193">
of his land at a very light purcha&s;e. But what crowned all, was that noble charter of privileges, by which he made them as free as any people in the world; and which has &s;ince drawn &s;uch va&s;t numbers of &s;o many diffe|rent per&s;ua&s;ions, and &s;uch various countries, to put them&s;elves under the protection of his laws. He made the mo&s;t perfect freedom, both religious and civil, the ba&s;is of this e&s;ta|bli&s;hment; and this has done more towards the &s;ettling of the province, and towards the &s;et|tling of it in a &s;trong and permanent manner, than the wi&s;e&s;t regulations could have done upon any other plan. All per&s;ons who pro|fe&s;s to believe one God, are freely tolerated; tho&s;e who believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of whatever denomination, are not excluded from employ|ments and po&s;ts.</P>
<P>This great man lived to &s;ee an exten&s;ive country called after his own name; he lived to &s;ee it peopled by his own wi&s;dom, the people free and flouri&s;hing, and the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing people in it of his own per&s;ua&s;ion; he lived to lay the foundations of a &s;plendid and wealthy city; he lived to &s;ee it promi&s;e every thing from the &s;ituation which he him|&s;elf had cho&s;en, and the encouragement which he him&s;elf had given it; he lived to &s;ee all this, but he died in the Fleet pri&s;on.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;t, that in &s;uch a &s;ubject we &s;hould allot a little room, to do honour to

tho&s;e great men, who&s;e virtue and genero&s;ity have contributed to the peopling of the earth, and to the freedom and happine&s;s of mankind; who have preferred the intere&s;t of a remote po&s;terity, and times unknown, to their own fortunes, and to the quiet and &s;ecurity of their own lives.

<P>PENSYLVANIA is inhabited by up|wards of two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and people, half of whom are Germans, Swedes or Dutch. Here you &s;ee the quakers, churchmen, calvini&s;ts, lutherans, catholics, methodi&s;ts, meni&s;ts, moravians, indepen|dents, the anabapti&s;ts, and the dumplers, a &s;ort of German &s;ect that live in &s;omething like a religious &s;ociety, wear long beards, and a habit re&s;embling that of friars; in &s;hort, the diver&s;ity of people, religions, nations, and languages here, is prodigious, and the har|mony in which they live together, no le&s;s edifying. For though every man who wi&s;hes well to religion, is &s;orry to &s;ee the diver&s;ity
<PB N="193" REF="195">
which prevails, and would by all humane and hone&s;t methods endeavour to prevent it; yet when once the evil has happened, when there is no longer an union of &s;entiments, it is glo|rious to pre&s;erve at lea&s;t an union of affecti|ons; it is a beautiful pro&s;pect, to &s;ee men take and give an equal liberty; to &s;ee them live, if not as belonging to the &s;ame church, yet to the &s;ame chri&s;tian religion; and if not to the &s;ame religion, yet to the &s;ame great fraterni|ty of mankind. I do not ob&s;erve, that the quakers who had, and who &s;till have in a great mea&s;ure, the power in their hands, have made u&s;e of it in any &s;ort to per&s;ecute; except in the &s;ingle ca&s;e of George Keith, whom they fir&s;t impri&s;oned, and then bani&s;h|ed out of the province. This Keith was ori|ginally a mini&s;ter of the church of England, then a quaker, and afterwards returned to his former mini&s;try. But whil&s;t he remained with the friends, he was a mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and litigious man; was for pu&s;hing the parti|cularities of quakeri&s;m to yet more extravagant lengths, and for making new refinements, even where the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic thought they had gone far enough; which rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;torm, as &s;hook the church, he then adhered to, to the very foundations.</P>
<P>This little &s;ally into intolerance, as it is a &s;ingle in&s;tance, and with great provocation, ought by no means to be imputed to the prin|ciples
<PB N="194" REF="196">
of the quakers, con&s;idering the ample and humane latitude they have allowed in all other re&s;pects. It was certainly a very right policy to encourage the importation of fo|reigners into Pen&s;ylvania, as well as into our other colonies. By this we are great gainers without any diminution of the inhabitants of Great Britain. But it has been frequently ob|&s;erved, and as it &s;hould &s;eem, very ju&s;tly com|plained of, that they are left &s;till foreigners, and likely to continue &s;o for many genera|tions; as they have &s;chools taught, books printed, and even the common news paper in their own language; by which means, and that they po&s;&s;e&s;s large tracts of the country, without any intermixture of Engli&s;h, there is no appearance of their blending and becoming one people with us. This certainly is a great irregularity, and the greater, as the&s;e foreign|ers by their indu&s;try, frugality, and a hard way of living, in which they greatly exceed our people, have in a manner thru&s;t them out in &s;everal places; &s;o as to threaten the colony with the danger of being wholly fo|reign in language, manners, and perhaps even inclinations. In the year 1750, were import|ed into Pen&s;ylvania and it's dependencies four thou&s;and three hundred and &s;eventeen Ger|mans, whereas of Briti&s;h and Iri&s;h, but one thou&s;and arrived; a con&s;iderable number, if
<PB N="195" REF="197">
it was not &s;o va&s;tly overballanced by that of the foreigners.</P>
<P>I do by no means think that this &s;ort of tran&s;plantations ought to be di&s;couraged; I only ob&s;erve along with others, that the man|ner of their &s;ettlement ought to be regulated, and means &s;ought to have them naturalized in reality.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent troubles have very unhappily re|ver&s;ed the &s;y&s;tem &s;o long pur&s;ued, and with &s;uch great &s;ucce&s;s in this part of the world. The Pen&s;ylvanians have &s;uffered &s;everely by the in|cur&s;ions of the &s;avage Americans as well as their neighbours; but the quakers could not be pre|vailed upon, by what did not directly affect tho&s;e of their own communion, (for they were out of the way of mi&s;chief in the more &s;ettled parts,) to relinqui&s;h their pacific principles; for which rea&s;on a con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition, in which, however, we mu&s;t do the quakers the ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve they were not unanimous, was made both within their a&s;&s;embly, as well as without doors, again&s;t granting any money to carry on the war; and the &s;ame, or a more vigorous oppo&s;ition, was made again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing a militia bill. A bill of this kind has at length pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;carcely &s;uch as the cir|cum&s;tances of the country, and the exigencies of the times required. It may perhaps ap|pear an error, to have placed &s;o great a part of the government in the hands of men, who
<PB N="196" REF="198">
hold principles directly oppo&s;ite to it's end and de&s;ign. As a peaceable, indu&s;trious, ho|ne&s;t people, the quakers cannot be too much cheri&s;hed; but &s;urely they cannot them&s;elves complain, that when by their opinions they make them&s;elves &s;heep, they &s;hould not be entru&s;ted with the office, &s;ince they have not the nature of dogs.</P>

<P>THERE are &s;o many good towns in the province of Pen&s;ylvania, even ex|ceeding the capitals of &s;ome other provinces, that nothing could excu&s;e our pa&s;&s;ing them by, had not Philadelphia drawn our attention wholly to it&s;elf. This city &s;tands upon a tongue of land, immediately at the confluence of two fine rivers, the Delawar and the Schul|kil. It is di&s;po&s;ed in the form of an oblong, de&s;igned to extend two miles, from river to river; this longe&s;t &s;tretch is laid out upon the original plan, to compo&s;e eight parallel &s;treets, all of two miles in length; the&s;e were to have been inter&s;ected by &s;ixteen others, each in length a mile, broad, &s;pacious, and even; with proper &s;paces left for the public buildings, churches, and market-places. In the center is a &s;quare of ten acres, round which mo&s;t of the public buildings are di&s;po&s;ed. The two
<PB N="197" REF="199">
principal &s;treets of the city are each one hun|dred feet wide, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es have a &s;mall garden and orchard; from the rivers are cut &s;everal canals, equally agreeable and beneficial. The kays are &s;pacious and fine; the principal kay is two hundred feet wide, and to this a ve&s;&s;el of five hundred tons may lay her broad&s;ide; the warehou&s;es are large, numerous and commodious, and the docks for &s;hip-building every way well adapted to their purpo&s;es. A great number of ve&s;&s;els have been built here; twenty have been upon the &s;tocks at a time. This city contains, ex|clu&s;ive of warehou&s;es and outhou&s;es, about two thou&s;and hou&s;es; mo&s;t of them of brick, and well built; it is &s;aid there are &s;everal of them worth four or five thou&s;and pounds. The inhabitants are now about thirteen thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>There are in this city a great number of very wealthy merchants, which is no way &s;urpri&s;ing, when one con&s;iders the great trade which it carries on with the Engli&s;h, French, Spani&s;h and Dutch colonies in America; with the Azores, the Canaries, and the Ma|deira i&s;lands; with Great Britain and Ireland; with Spain, Portugal and Holland, and the great profits which are made in many branch|es of this commerce. Be&s;ides the quan|tity of all kinds of the produce of this pro|vince which is brought down the rivers De|lawar
<PB N="198" REF="200">
and Schulkil (the former of which is navigable for ve&s;&s;els of one &s;ort or other more than two hundred miles above Phila|delphia, and the other for very near an hun|dred) the Dutch employ between eight and nine thou&s;and waggons, drawn each by four hor&s;es, in bringing the product of their farms to this market. In the year 1749, three hun|dred and three ve&s;&s;els entered inwards at this port, and two hundred and ninety-one clear|ed outwards. There are at the other ports of this province cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, but the foreign trade in the&s;e places is not worth notice.</P>
<P>The city of Philadelphia, though, as it may be judged, far from compleating the original plan; yet &s;o far as it is built, it is carried on conformably to it, and increa&s;es in the number and beauty of it's buildings every day. And as for the province, of which this city is the capital, there is no part of Bri|ti&s;h America in a more growing condition. In &s;ome years more people have tran&s;ported them&s;elves into Pen&s;ylvania, than into all the other &s;ettlements together. In 1729, &s;ix thou&s;and two hundred and eight per&s;ons came to &s;ettle here as pa&s;&s;engers or &s;ervants, four fifths of whom at lea&s;t were from Ireland. In &s;hort, this province has increa&s;ed &s;o great|ly from the time of it's fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, that lands were given by Mr. Pen at fir&s;t at
<PB N="199" REF="201">
the rate of twenty pounds for a thou&s;and acres, re&s;erving only a &s;hilling, every hundred acres for quit-rent, and this in &s;ome of the be&s;t &s;ituated parts of the province; but now at a great di&s;tance from navigation, land is granted at twelve pounds the hundred acres, and a quit-rent of four &s;hillings re&s;erved; and the land which is near Philadelphia, rents for twenty &s;hillings the acre. In many places, and at the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles from that city, land &s;ells for twenty years pur|cha&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pen&s;ylvanians are an indu&s;trious and hardy people; they are mo&s;t of them &s;ub|&s;tantial, though but a few of the landed peo|ple can be con&s;idered as rich; but they are all well lodged, well fed, and, for their condition, well clad too; and this at the more ea&s;y rate, as the inferior people manufacture mo&s;t of all their own wear both linens and woollens. There are but few blacks, not in all the fortieth part of the people of the pro|vince.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole country which the Engli&s;h now po&s;&s;e&s;s in North America, was at fir&s;t called Virginia; but by parcelling of &s;everal portions of it into di&s;tinct grants and governments, the country which &s;till bears the name, is now reduced to that tract which has the river Potowmack upon the North; the bay of Che&s;apeak upon the Ea&s;t; and Carolina upon the South. To the We&s;t|ward the grants extend it to the South-Sea; but their planting goes no farther than the great Allegany mountains, which boundaries leave this province in length two hundred and forty miles, and in breadth about two hun|dred, lying between the fifty-fi&s;th and fortieth degrees of North latitude.</P>
<P>The whole face of this country is &s;o ex|tremely low towards the &s;ea, that when you are come even within fifteen fathom &s;ound|ings you can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h land from the ma&s;t head. However, all this coa&s;t of Ame|rica has one u&s;eful particularity, that you know your di&s;tance exactly by the &s;oundings, which uniformly and gradually dimini&s;h as
<PB N="201" REF="203">
you approach the land. The trees appear as if they ro&s;e out of the water, and afford the &s;tranger a very uncommon, and not a di&s;agree|able view. In &s;ailing to Virginia or Mary|land, you pa&s;s a &s;treight between two points of land, called the Capes of Virginia, which opens a pa&s;&s;age into the bay of Che&s;apeak, one of the large&s;t and &s;afe&s;t bays perhaps in the world; for it enters the country near three hundred miles from the South to the North, having the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of Maryland, and a &s;mall portion of Virginia on the &s;ame penin&s;ula, to cover it from the Atlantic ocean. This bay is about eighteen miles broad for a con&s;iderable way, and &s;even where it is nar|rowe&s;t, the waters in mo&s;t places being nine fathom deep. Through it's whole extent it receives both on the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern &s;ide a va&s;t number of fine navigable rivers. Not to mention tho&s;e of Maryland, from the &s;ide of Virginia it receives James River, York River, the Rappahannock, and the Potow|mack.</P>
<P>All the&s;e great rivers, in the order they are here &s;et down from South to North, di&s;charge them&s;elves with &s;everal &s;maller ones into the bay of Che&s;apeak; and they are all not only navigable them&s;elves for very large ve&s;&s;els a prodigious way into the country, but have &s;o many creeks, and receive &s;uch a number of &s;maller navigable rivers, as renders the com|munication
<PB N="202" REF="204">
of all parts of this country in|finitely more ea&s;y than that of any country, without exception, in the world. The Potow|mack is navigable for near two hundred miles, being nine miles broad at it's mouth, and for a va&s;t way not le&s;s than &s;even. The other three are navigable upwards of eighty, and in the windings of their &s;everal cour&s;es approach one another &s;o nearly, that the di&s;tance be|tween one and the other is in &s;ome parts not more than ten, &s;ometimes not above five miles; whereas in others there is fifty miles &s;pace between each of the&s;e rivers. The planters load and unload ve&s;&s;els of great bur|then each at his own door; which, as their commodities are bulky, and of &s;mall value in proportion to their bulk, is a very fortunate circum&s;tance, el&s;e they could never afford to &s;end their tobacco to market low as they &s;ell it, and charged as it is in England, with a duty of &s;ix times it's original value.</P>
<P>The climate and &s;oil of Virginia was un|doubtedly much heightened in the fir&s;t de&s;crip|tions for political rea&s;ons; but after making all the nece&s;&s;ary abatements which experience &s;ince taught us, we &s;till find it a mo&s;t excellent country. The heats in &s;ummer are exce&s;&s;ive|ly great, but not without the allay of refre&s;h|ing &s;ea breezes. The weather is changeable, and the changes &s;udden and violent. Their winter fro&s;ts come on without the lea&s;t warn|ing.
<PB N="203" REF="205">
After a warm day, towards the &s;etting in of winter, &s;o inten&s;e a cold often &s;uc|ceeds as to freeze over the broade&s;t and deep|e&s;t of their great rivers in one night, but the&s;e fro&s;ts, as well as their rains, are rather violent than of long continuance. They have frequent and violent thunder and lightning, but it does rarely any mi&s;chief. In general the &s;ky is clear, and the air thin, pure, and penetrating.</P>
<P>The &s;oil in the low grounds of Virginia is a dark fat mould, which for many years with|out any manure, yields plentifully whatever is committed to it. The &s;oil as you leave the rivers becomes light and &s;andy, is &s;ooner ex|hau&s;ted than the low country, but is yet of a warm and generous nature, which helped by a kindly &s;un, yields tobacco and corn extremely well. There is no better wheat than what is produced in this province and Maryland; but the culture of tobacco employs all their attention, and almo&s;t all their hands; &s;o that they &s;carcely cultivate wheat enough for their own u&s;e.</P>
<P>It may be judged from the climate and the &s;oil I have de&s;cribed, in what excellence and plenty every &s;ort of fruit is found in Virginia. Their fore&s;ts are full of timber trees of all kinds; and their plains are covered for almo&s;t the whole year with a prodigious number of flowers, and flowering &s;hrubs, of colours &s;o
<PB N="204" REF="206">
rich, and of a &s;cent &s;o fragrant, that they oc|ca&s;ioned the name of Florida to be originally given to this country. This country produces &s;everal medicinal herbs and roots, particular|ly the &s;nake root; and of late the celebrated gin&s;eng of the Chine&s;e has been di&s;covered there.</P>
<P>Horned cattle and hogs have multiplied al|mo&s;t beyond belief; though at the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment the country was utterly de&s;titute of the&s;e animals. The meat of the former is as much below the fle&s;h of our oxen, as that of the latter exceeds that of our hogs. The ani|mals natural to the country are deer, of which there are great numbers; a &s;ort of panther or tyger; bears, wolves, foxes, racoons, &s;quirrels, wild cats, and one very uncommon animal called the opo&s;&s;um. This creature is about the &s;ize of a cat, and be&s;ides the belly which it has in common with all others, has a fal&s;e one beneath it, with a pretty large aperture at the end towards the hinder legs. Within this bag, or belly, on the u&s;ual parts of the com|mon belly, are a number of teats; upon the&s;e, when the female of this creature conceives, the young are formed, and there they hang like fruit upon the &s;talk, until they grow in bulk and weight to their appointed &s;ize; then they drop off, and are received in the fal&s;e belly, from which they go out at plea&s;ure, and in which they take refuge when any danger threatens them.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="207">They have all our &s;orts of tame and wild fowl in equal perfection, and &s;ome which we have not; and a va&s;t number of birds of various kinds, valuable for their beauty or their note. The white owl of Virginia is far larger than the &s;pecies which we have, and is all over of a bright &s;ilver coloured plumage, except one black &s;pot upon his brea&s;t; they have the nightingale called from the country, a mo&s;t beautiful one, who&s;e feathers are crim&s;on and blue; the mocking bird, thought to excel all others in his own note, and he imitates the notes of all others; the rock bird, very &s;ociable, and his &s;ociety very agreeable by the &s;weetne&s;s of his mu&s;ic; the humming bird, the &s;malle&s;t of all the winged creation, and the mo&s;t beautiful, all arrayed in &s;carlet, green and gold. This bird is &s;aid to live by licking off the dew that adheres to the flowers; he is too delicate to be brought alive into England. The &s;ea-coa&s;ts and rivers of Virginia abound not only in &s;everal of the &s;pecies of fi&s;h known in Europe, but in mo&s;t of tho&s;e kinds which are peculiar to America. The rep|tiles are many; it were tedious to enumerate all the kinds of &s;erpents bred here; the rattle &s;nake is the principal, and too well known in general to need any de&s;cription.</P>

<P>THE great commodiou&s;ne&s;s of naviga|tion, and the &s;carcity of handicrafts|men, have rendered all the attempts of the government to e&s;tabli&s;h towns in Virginia ineffectual. James's-town, which was an|ciently the capital, is dwindled into an in&s;ig|nificant village; and William&s;burg, though the capital at pre&s;ent, the &s;eat of the governor, the place of holding the a&s;&s;embly and courts of ju&s;tice, and a college for the &s;tudy of arts and &s;ciences, is yet but a &s;mall town. However, in this town are the be&s;t public buildings in Briti&s;h America. The college one hundred and thirty-five feet long in front, re&s;embling Chel&s;ea ho&s;pital; the capital directly facing it at the other end of the de&s;ign of a noble &s;treet, not unlike the college in the fa&s;hion and the &s;ize of the building, where the a&s;|&s;embly and courts of ju&s;tice are held, and the public offices kept; and the church, in the form of a cro&s;s, large and well ornamented.</P>
<P>The great &s;taple commodity of this country, as well as Maryland, is tobacco. This plant is aboriginal in America, and of very ancient u&s;e, though neither &s;o generally cultivated, nor &s;o well manufactured as it has been &s;ince the coming of the Europeans. When at it's
<PB N="207" REF="209">
ju&s;t height, it is as tall as an ordinary &s;ized man; the &s;talk is &s;traight, hairy, and clam|my; the leaves alternate, of a faded yellowi&s;h green, and towards the lower part of the plant of a great &s;ize. The &s;eeds of tobacco are fir&s;t &s;own in beds, from whence they are tran&s;planted the fir&s;t rainy weather, into a ground di&s;po&s;ed into little hillocks like an hop garden. In a month's time from their tran&s;plantation they become a foot high; they then top them, and prune off the lower leaves, and with great attention clean them from weeds and worms twice a week; in about &s;ix weeks after, they attain to their full growth, and they begin then to turn browni&s;h. By the&s;e marks they judge the tobacco to be ripe. They cut down the plants as fa&s;t as they ripen, heap them up, and let them lie a night to &s;weat; the next day they carry them to the tobacco hou&s;e, which is built to admit as much air as is con&s;i&s;tent with keeping out rain, where they are hung &s;eparately to dry for four or five weeks, then they take them down in moi&s;t weather, for el&s;e they will crumble to du&s;t. After this they are laid upon &s;ticks, and covered up clo&s;e to &s;weat for a week or two longer; the &s;ervants &s;trip and &s;ort them, the top being the be&s;t, the bottom the wor&s;t tobacco; then they make them up in hog&s;heads, or form them into rolls. Wet &s;ea&s;ons mu&s;t be carefully laid hold on for all
<PB N="208" REF="210">
this work, el&s;e the tobacco will not be &s;uffi|ciently pliable.</P>
<P>In trade they di&s;tingui&s;h two &s;orts of to|bacco, the fir&s;t is called Aranokoe, from Maryland and the Northern parts of Virginia; this is &s;trong and hot in the mouth, but it &s;ells very well in the markets of Holland, Germany, and the North. The other &s;ort is called &s;weet &s;cented, the be&s;t of which is from James's and York rivers in the South|ern parts of Virginia. There is no commo|dity to which the revenue is &s;o much obliged as to this. It produces a va&s;t &s;um, and yet appears to lay but a very incon&s;iderable burthen upon the people in England; all the weight in reality falls upon the planter, who is kept down by the lowne&s;s of the original price; and as we have two provinces which deal in the &s;ame commodity, if the people of Vir|ginia were to take mea&s;ures to &s;traiten the market, and rai&s;e the price, tho&s;e of Mary|land would certainly take the advantage of it; the people of Virginia would take the &s;ame advantage of tho&s;e of Maryland in a like ca&s;e. They have no pro&s;pect of ever bettering their condition; and they are the le&s;s able to en|dure it as they live in general luxuriou&s;ly, and to the full extent of their fortunes. There|fore any failure in the &s;ale of their goods, brings them heavily in debt to the merchants in London, who get mortgages on their e&s;tates,
<PB N="209" REF="211">
which are con&s;umed to the bone, with the canker of an eight per cent u&s;ury. But how|ever the planters may complain of the tobacco trade, the revenue flouri&s;hes by it, for it draws near three hundred thou&s;and a year from this one article only; and the exported tobacco, the far greater part of the profits of which come to the Engli&s;h merchant, brings almo&s;t as great a &s;um annually into the kingdom. To &s;ay nothing of the great advantage we derive from being &s;upplied from our own colonies with that for which the re&s;t of Europe pays ready money, be&s;ides the employment of two hundred large ve&s;&s;els, and a proportionable number of &s;eamen, which are occupied in this trade. From us the Virginians take every article for convenience or ornament which they u&s;e; their own manufacture does not de|&s;erve to be mentioned. The two colonies export about eighty thou&s;and hog&s;heads of tobacco of eight hundred weight. They like|wi&s;e trade largely with the We&s;t-Indies in lumber, pitch, tar, corn, and provi&s;ions. They &s;end home flax, hemp, iron, &s;taves, and walnut and cedar plank.</P>
<P>The number of white people in Virginia, is between &s;ixty and &s;eventy thou&s;and; and they are growing every day more numerous, by the migration of the Iri&s;h, who not &s;ucceed|ing &s;o well in Pen&s;ylvania, as the more frugal and indu&s;trious Germans, &s;ell their lands in
<PB N="210" REF="212">
that province to the latter, and take up new ground in the remote counties in Vir|ginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. The&s;e are chiefly pre&s;byterians from the Northern part of Ireland, who in America are general|ly called Scotch Iri&s;h. In Virginia there are likewi&s;e &s;ettled a con&s;iderable number of French refugees; but much the larger part of the inhabitants are the negro &s;laves, who cannot be much fewer than a hundred thou|&s;and &s;ouls; they annually import into the two tobacco colonies between three and four thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;laves. The negroes here do not &s;tand in need of &s;uch va&s;t recruits as the We&s;t-India &s;tock; they rather increa&s;e than dimini&s;h; a ble&s;&s;ing derived from a more moderate labour, better food and a more healthy climate. The inhabitants of Virginia are a chearful, ho&s;pitable, and many of them a genteel though &s;omewhat vain and o&s;tenta|tious people; they are for the greater part of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church of England; nor until lately did they tolerate any other. Now they have &s;ome few meeting-hou&s;es of pre&s;byteri|ans and quakers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<P>THIS of Virginia is the mo&s;t ancient of our colonies. Tho' &s;trictly &s;peaking the fir&s;t attempts to &s;ettle a colony were not made in Virginia, but in that part of North Carolina which immediately borders upon it. Sir Walter Raleigh, the mo&s;t extraordinary genius of his own or perhaps any other time, a penetrating &s;tate&s;man, an accompli&s;hed courtier, a deep &s;cholar, a fine writer, a great &s;oldier, and one of the able&s;t &s;eamen in the world; this va&s;t genius, that pierced &s;o far and ran through &s;o many things, was of a fiery excentric kind, which led him into dar|ing expeditions, and uncommon projects, which not being under&s;tood by a timid prince, and envied and hated by the rivals he had in &s;o many ways of life, ruined him at la&s;t. In per&s;on he ran infinite ri&s;ques in Guiana in &s;earch of gold mines; and when this country was fir&s;t di&s;covered, he looked through the work of an age, at one glance, and &s;aw how advantageous it might be made to the trade of England. He was the fir&s;t man in England who had a right conception of the advantages of &s;ettlements abroad; he was then the only per&s;on who had a thorough in&s;ight into trade, and who &s;aw clearly the
<PB N="212" REF="214">
proper methods of promoting it. He applied to court, and got together a company, which was compo&s;ed of &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and &s;everal eminent merchants, who agreed to open a trade and &s;ettle a colony in that part of the world, which in honour of queen Eli|zabeth he called Virginia.</P>
<P>Raleigh had too much bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands at court, and found too few to &s;econd him in his de&s;igns, to enable him to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hment with the &s;pirit in which he began it. If ever any de&s;ign had an ominous beginning, and &s;eemed to forbid any attempts for carrying it on, it was that of the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment of Virginia. Near half of the fir&s;t co|lony was de&s;troyed by the &s;avages, and the re&s;t con&s;umed and worn down by fatigue and famine, de&s;erted the country, and returned home in de&s;pair. The &s;econd colony was cut off, to a man, in a manner unknown; but they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;troyed by the Indians. The third had the &s;ame di&s;mal fate; and the fourth quarrelling among&s;t them|&s;elves, neglecting their agriculture to hunt for gold, and provoking the Indians by their in&s;olent and unguarded behaviour, lo&s;t &s;everal of their people, and were returning, the poor remains of them, in a fami&s;hing and de&s;perate condition to England, when ju&s;t in the mouth of Che&s;apeak bay they met the lord Delawar with a &s;quadron, loaded with provi&s;ion, and
<PB N="213" REF="215">
every thing for their relief and defence, who per&s;uaded them to return.</P>
<P>This nobleman travelled with as much zeal and a&s;&s;iduity to cheri&s;h and &s;upport the froward infancy of this unpromi&s;ing colony, as &s;ome have u&s;ed in it's better times for purpo&s;es of another kind. Regardle&s;s of his life, and inattentive to his fortune, he entered upon this long and dangerous voyage, and accepted this barren province, which had nothing of a government but it's anxieties and it's cares, merely for the &s;ervice of his coun|try; and he had no other reward than that retired and inward &s;atisfaction, which a good mind feels in indulging it's own propen&s;ity to virtue, and the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e ju&s;t honours which the late&s;t po&s;terity will take a plea&s;ure in be&s;towing upon tho&s;e, who prefer the intere&s;t of po&s;terity to their own. After he had pre|vailed upon the people to return, he comfort|ed them under their misfortunes, he pointed out their cau&s;es, and uniting the tenderne&s;s of a father with the &s;teady &s;everity of a magi&s;trate, he healed their divi&s;ions, and reconciled them to authority and govern|ment, by making them feel by his conduct what a ble&s;&s;ing it could be made.</P>
<P>When he had &s;ettled the colony within it|&s;elf, his next care was to put them upon a proper footing with regard to the Indians, whom he found very haughty and a&s;&s;uming
<PB N="214" REF="216">
on account of the late mi&s;erable &s;tate of the Engli&s;h; but by &s;ome well-timed and vigo|rous &s;teps he humbled them, &s;hewed he had power to cha&s;ti&s;e them, and courage to exert that power; and after having awed them into very peaceable di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;ettled his colony in a very growing condition, he retired home for the benefit of his health, which by his con&s;tant attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, and the air of an uncultivated country, had been impaired; but he left his &s;on, with the &s;pirit of his fa|ther, his deputy; and Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Summers, the honourable George Piercy, Sir Ferdinand Wenman, and Mr. Newport, for his council. The&s;e, with other per&s;ons of rank and fortune, attended him on this expedition, which gave a credit to the colony. Though there are in England many young gentlemen of fortunes, di&s;proportioned to their rank, I fear we &s;hould not &s;ee the names of &s;o many of them engaged in an expe|dition, which had no better appearance than this had at that time.</P>
<P>Lord Delawar did not forget the colony on his return to England; but con&s;idering him|&s;elf as nearer the fountain head, thought it his duty to turn the &s;pring of the royal favour more copiou&s;ly upon the province which he &s;uperintended. For eight years together he was indefatigable in doing every thing that could tend to the peopling, the &s;upport, and

<P>THE colony of Virginia was &s;o fa&s;t rooted by the care of lord Delawar, that it was enabled to &s;tand two terrible &s;torms; two ma&s;&s;acres made by the Indians, in which the whole colony was nearly cut off; and to &s;ubdue that people, &s;o as to put it utterly out of their power for many years pa&s;t to give them the lea&s;t di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>In the fatal troubles which brought Charles the fir&s;t to the block, and overturned the con|&s;titution of England, many of the cavaliers fled for refuge to this colony, which by the general di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, and the virtue of Sir William Berkley, held out for the crown, until the parliament, rather by &s;tratagem than force, reduced them. And what is remarkable, if it may be depended upon with any certainty, they depo&s;ed Crom|well's governor, &s;et up Sir William Berk|ley again, and declared for king Charles the &s;econd, a good while even before the news of Oliver's death could arrive in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>After the re&s;toration, there is nothing very intere&s;ting in their hi&s;tory; except that &s;oon after, a &s;ort of rebellion which aro&s;e in the

province from mi&s;managements in the govern|ment, from the decay of their trade, and from exorbitant grants incon&s;iderately made, which included the &s;ettled property of many people; this rai&s;ed a general di&s;content a|mong&s;t the planters, which was fomented and brought to blaze out into an actual war, by a young gentleman who&s;e name was Bacon. He was an agreeable man, of a graceful pre|&s;ence, and winning carriage. He had been bred to the law, had a lively and fluent ex|pre&s;&s;ion, fit to &s;et off a popular cau&s;e, and to influence men who were ready to hear what|ever could be &s;aid to colour in a proper manner what was already &s;trongly drawn by their own feelings. This man by a &s;pecious, or perhaps a real tho' ill-judged regard for the public good, finding the governor &s;low in his preparations again&s;t the Indians, who were ravaging the frontiers of the province, took up arms with|out any commi&s;&s;ion, to act again&s;t the ene|my. When he had &s;ufficient force for this purpo&s;e, he found him&s;elf in a condition not only to act again&s;t the enemy, but to give law to the governor, and to force him to give a &s;anction by his authority, to tho&s;e proceedings which were meant to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>Bacon armed with the commi&s;&s;ion of a ge|neral, and followed by the whole force of the colony, prepared to march again&s;t the Indians; when Sir William Berkley, the governor,
<PB N="218" REF="220">
freed from the immediate terror of his forces, recalled him, proclaimed him a traitor, and i&s;&s;ued a reward for apprehending him as &s;uch. This brought matters to extremities; the people were univer&s;ally inflamed; Bacon ad|hered to what he had done, the people adhe|red to Bacon; and the governor, who &s;eemed no ways inclined to temporize or yield to the &s;torm, fled over the river Potowmack, and proclaimed all Bacon's adherents traitors. He put him&s;elf at the head of a &s;mall body of troops which he had rai&s;ed in Maryland, and of &s;uch of the Virginians as were faithful to him, and wrote to England for &s;upplies. On the other hand, Bacon marched to the capital, called an a&s;&s;embly, and for &s;ix months toge|ther di&s;po&s;ed all things according to his own plea&s;ure. Every thing was now ha&s;tening to a civil war, when all was quieted in as &s;udden a manner as it had begun, by the natural death of Bacon, in the very height of the confu&s;ion. The people unable to act without a head, pro|po&s;ed terms of accommodation; the terms were li&s;tened to, and peace was re&s;tored and kept without any di&s;turbance, not &s;o much by the removal of the grievances complained of, as by the arrival of a regiment from Eng|land, which remained a long time in the country. It mu&s;t be remarked in honour of the moderation of the government, that no per&s;on &s;uffered in his life, or his e&s;tate, for this
<PB N="219" REF="221">
rebellion, which was the more extraordinary, as many people at that time were very earne&s;t in &s;olliciting grants of land in Virginia.</P>
<P>The events in all countries which are not the re&s;idence of the &s;upreme power, and have no concern in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;act|ing war and peace, have generally but little to engage the attention of the reader. I have therefore intirely omitted the tedious detail of the governors and their &s;everal tran&s;actions, with which my materials &s;o plentifully &s;upply me; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on I &s;hall be very conci&s;e in my account of Maryland, which agreeing altogether with Virginia in it's cli|mate, &s;oil, products, trade, and genius of the inhabitants, and having few or no remarkable events to recommend it, will &s;ave much trouble in that article.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. MARYLAND.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, that the Lord Baltimore applied for a patent for a part of Virginia, and obtained in 1632, a grant of a tract of land upon Che&s;a|peak bay, of about an hundred and forty miles long, and an hundred and thirty broad, hav|ing Pen&s;ylvania, then in the hands of the
<PB N="220" REF="222">
Dutch, upon the North, the Atlantic ocean upon the Ea&s;t, and the river Potowmack up|on the South; in honour of the queen he called this province Maryland.</P>
<P>Lord Baltimore was a Roman catholic, and was induced to attempt this &s;ettlement in America, in hopes of enjoying liberty of con|&s;cience for him&s;elf, and for &s;uch of his friends to whom the &s;everity of the laws might loo&s;en their ties to their country, and make them prefer an ea&s;y bani&s;hment with freedom, to the conveniencies of England, embittered as they were by the &s;harpne&s;s of the laws, and the popular odium which hung over them. The court at that time was certainly very little inclined to treat the Roman catholics in a har&s;h manner, neither had they in reality the lea&s;t appearance of rea&s;on to do &s;o; but the laws them&s;elves were of a rigorous con&s;ti|tution; and however the court might be in|clined to relax them, they could not in policy do it, but with great re&s;erve. The puritan party perpetually accu&s;ed the court, and indeed the epi&s;copal church, of a de&s;ire of returning to popery; and this accu&s;ation was &s;o popu|lar, that it was not in the power of the court to &s;hew the papi&s;ts that indulgence which they de&s;ired. The laws were &s;till executed with very little mitigation; and they were in them&s;elves of a much keener temper, than tho&s;e which had driven the puritans about
<PB N="221" REF="223">
the &s;ame time to &s;eek a refuge in the &s;ame part of the world. The&s;e rea&s;ons made lord Baltimore de&s;irous to have, and the court willing to give him, a place of retreat in America.</P>
<P>The &s;ettlement of the colony co&s;t the lord Baltimore a large &s;um. It was made under his au&s;pices by his brother, and about two hundred per&s;ons, Roman catholics, and mo&s;t of them of good families. This &s;ettlement at the beginning did not meet with the &s;ame dif|ficulties, which embarra&s;&s;ed and retarded mo&s;t of the others we had made. The people were generally of the better &s;ort, a proper &s;ubordination was ob&s;erved among&s;t them, and the Indians gave and took &s;o little offence, that they ceded one half of their principal town, and &s;ome time after the whole of it, to the&s;e &s;trangers. The Indian women taught ours how to make bread of their corn; their men went out to hunt and fi&s;h with the Eng|li&s;h; they a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in the chace, and &s;old them the game they took them&s;elves for a trifling con&s;ideration; &s;o that the new &s;ettlers had a &s;ort of town ready built, ground ready cleared for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and no enemy to harra&s;s them.</P>
<P>They lived thus, without much trouble or fear, until &s;ome ill-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons in Virgi|nia in&s;inuated to the Indians, that the Balti|more colony had de&s;igns upon them; that
<PB N="222" REF="224">
they were Spaniards and not Engli&s;hmen, and &s;uch other &s;tories as they judged proper to &s;ow the &s;eeds of &s;u&s;picion and enmity in the minds of the&s;e people. Upon the fir&s;t appearance, that the malice of the Virgini|ans had taken effect, the new planters were not wanting to them&s;elves. They built a good fort with all expedition, and took every other nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure for their defence; but they continued &s;till to treat the Indians with &s;o much kindne&s;s, that partly by that, and partly by the awe of their arms, the ill de&s;igns of their enemies were defeated.</P>
<P>As the colony met with &s;o few ob&s;tructions, and as the Roman catholics in England were yet more &s;everely treated in proportion as the court party declined, numbers con&s;tantly ar|rived to repleni&s;h the &s;ettlement; which the lord proprietor omitted no care, and witheld no expence to &s;upport and encourage; until the u&s;urpation overturned the government at home, and deprived him of his rights abroad. Maryland remained under the governors ap|pointed by the parliament and by Cromwell until the re&s;toration, when lord Baltimore was rein&s;tated in his former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which he cultivated with his former wi&s;dom, care and moderation. No people could live in greater ea&s;e and &s;ecurity; and his lord&s;hip, willing that as many as po&s;&s;ible &s;hould en|joy the benefits of his mild and equitable ad|mini&s;tration,
<PB N="223" REF="225">
gave his con&s;ent to an act of a&s;&s;embly, which he had before promoted in his province, for allowing a free and unlimit|ed toleration for all who profe&s;&s;ed the chri&s;ti|an religion of whatever denomination. This liberty, which was never in the lea&s;t in&s;tance violated, encouraged a great number, not only of the church of England, but of pre&s;byterians, quakers, and all kinds of di&s;&s;enters, to &s;ettle in Maryland, which before that was almo&s;t wholly in the hands of Roman catholics.</P>
<P>This lord, though guilty of no maleadmini|&s;tration in his government, though a zealous Roman catholic, and firmly attached to the cau&s;e of king James the &s;econd, could not prevent his charter from being que&s;tioned in that arbitrary reign, and a &s;uit from being commenced to deprive him of the property and juri&s;diction of a province granted by the royal favour, and peopled at &s;uch a va&s;t ex|pence of his own. But it was the error of that weak and unfortunate reign, neither to know it's friends, nor it's enemies; but by a blind precipitate conduct to hurry on every thing of whatever con&s;equence with almo&s;t equal heat, and to imagine that the &s;ound of the royal authority was &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify every &s;ort of conduct to every &s;ort of people. But the&s;e injuries could not &s;hake the honour and con&s;tancy of lord Baltimore, nor tempt him to de&s;ert the cau&s;e of his ma&s;ter. Upon
<PB N="224" REF="226">
the revolution he had no rea&s;on to expect any favour; yet he met with more than king James had intended him; he was deprived indeed of all his juri&s;diction, but he was left the profits of his province, which were by no means incon&s;iderable; and when his de&s;cen|dants had conformed to the church of Eng|land, they were re&s;tored to all their rights as fully as the legi&s;lature has thought fit that any proprietor &s;hould enjoy them.</P>
<P>When upon the revolution power changed hands in that province, the new men made but an indifferent requital for the liberties and indulgences they had enjoyed under the old admini&s;tration. They not only deprived the Roman catholics of all &s;hare in the govern|ment, but of all the rights of freemen; they have even adopted the whole body of the penal laws of England again&s;t them; they are at this day meditating new laws in the &s;ame &s;pirit, and they would undoubtedly go to the greate&s;t lengths in this re&s;pect, if the modera|tion and good &s;en&s;e of the government in Eng|land did not &s;et &s;ome bounds to their bigotry; thinking very prudently that it were highly unju&s;t, and equally impolitic, to allow an a&s;ylum abroad to any religious per&s;ua&s;ions which they judged it improper to tolerate at home, and then to deprive them of it's protection, recol|lecting at the &s;ame time in the various changes which our religion and government has un|dergone,
<PB N="225" REF="227">
which have in their turns rendered every &s;ort of party and religion obnoxious to the reigning powers, that this American a&s;y|lum which has been admitted in the hotte&s;t times of per&s;ecution at home, has proved of infinite &s;ervice, not only to the pre&s;ent peace of England, but to the pro&s;perity of it's com|merce, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of it's power. There are a &s;ort of men, who will not &s;ee &s;o plain a truth; and they are the per&s;ons who would appear to contend mo&s;t warmly for liberty; but it is only a party liberty for which they contend; a liberty, which they would &s;tretch out one way only to narrow it in another; they are not a&s;hamed of u&s;ing the very &s;ame pretences for per&s;ecuting others, that their enemies u&s;e for per&s;ecuting them.</P>
<P>This colony, as for a long time it had with Pen&s;ylvania the honour of being un&s;tained with any religious per&s;ecution, &s;o neither they nor the Pen&s;ylvanians have ever until very lately been harra&s;&s;ed by the calamity of any war, offen|&s;ive or defen&s;ive, with their Indian neighbours, with whom they always lived in the mo&s;t ex|emplary harmony. Indeed, in a war which the Indians made upon the colony of Virginia, by mi&s;take they made an incur&s;ion into the bounds of Maryland; but they were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;take, and attoned for it. This pre&s;ent war indeed has changed every
<PB N="226" REF="228">
thing, and the Indians have been taught to laugh at all their ancient alliances.</P>
<P>Maryland, like Virginia, has no con&s;ider|able town, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on; the number of navigable creeks and rivers. An|napolis is the &s;eat of government. It is a &s;mall but beautifully &s;ituated town upon the river Patuxent.</P>
<P>Here is the &s;eat of the governor, and the principal cu&s;tom-hou&s;e collection. The peo|ple of Maryland have the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion with tho&s;e of Virginia, that of the church of England but here the clergy are provided for in a much more liberal manner, and they are the mo&s;t decent, and the be&s;t of the clergy in North America. They export from Maryland the &s;ame things in all re&s;pects that they do from Virginia. Their tobacco is about forty thou&s;and hog&s;heads. The white inhabitants are about forty thou|&s;and; the negroes upwards of &s;ixty thou|&s;and.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be forgot, that we formerly called all the coa&s;t of North America by the name of Virginia. The province properly &s;o called, with Maryland and the Carolinas, was known by the name of South Virginia. By the Spaniards it was con&s;idered as part of Florida, which country they made to extend from New Mexico to the Atlantic ocean. By them it was fir&s;t di&s;covered; but they treated the natives with an inhumanity, which filled them with &s;o violent an hatred to the Spani&s;h name, as rendered their &s;ettlement there very difficult; nor did they pu&s;h it vigorou&s;ly, as the country &s;hewed no marks of producing gold or &s;ilver, the only things for which the Spaniards then valued any country. Florida therefore remained under an entire neglect in Europe, until the reign of Charles the ninth, king of France.</P>
<P>The celebrated leader of the prote&s;tants in that kingdom, the admiral Cha&s;tillon, who was not only a great commander but an able &s;tate&s;man, was a man of too comprehen&s;ive views not to &s;ee the advantages of a &s;ettle|ment in America; he procured two ve&s;&s;els
<PB N="228" REF="230">
to be fitted out for di&s;coveries upon that coa&s;t. He had it probably in his thoughts to retire thither with tho&s;e of his per&s;ua&s;ion, if the &s;ucce&s;s which hitherto &s;uited &s;o ill with his great courage and conduct, &s;hould at la&s;t en|tirely de&s;troy his cau&s;e in France. The&s;e &s;hips in two months arrived upon the coa&s;t of America, near the river now called Albe|marle in the province of North Carolina. The French gave the Indians to under&s;tand in the be&s;t manner they were able, that they were enemies to the Spaniards, which &s;ecured them a friendly reception, and the good offices of the inhabitants. They were, however, in no condition to make any &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>On their return to France, the admiral, at this time by the abominable policy of the court apparently in great favour, was &s;o well &s;atisfied with the account they had given of the country, that in 1564 he fitted out five or &s;ix &s;hips with as many hundred men aboard, to begin a colony there. This was according|ly done at the place of their landing in the fir&s;t expedition. They built a fort here, which they called Fort Charles, as they called the whole country Carolana in honour of their king then reigning. The Spaniards, who had intelligence of their proceedings, di&s;patched a con&s;iderable force to attack this colony, who not &s;atisfied with reducing it, put all the people to the &s;word after quarter given; and
<PB N="229" REF="231">
committing great outrages upon the natives, they paved the way for the vengeance which &s;oon after fell upon them for &s;uch an unnece&s;|&s;ary and unprovoked act of cruelty. For though the admiral and his party were by this time de&s;troyed in the infamous ma&s;&s;acre of St. Bartholomew, and though the de&s;ign of a colony died with him, one M. de Gorgues, a private gentleman, fitted out &s;ome &s;hips, which &s;ailed to that coa&s;t purely to revenge the murder of his countrymen, and his friends. The Indians greedily embraced the oppor|tunity of becoming a&s;&s;ociates in the puni&s;h|ment of the common enemy. They joined in the &s;iege of two or three forts the Spaniards had built there; they took them, and in all of them put the garri&s;on to the &s;word without mercy.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this action the adventurers returned, and happily for us, the French court did not under&s;tand, blinded as they were by their bigotry, the advantages which might have been derived from giving Ameri|ca to the prote&s;tants, as we afterwards did to the di&s;&s;enters, as a place of refuge; if they had taken this &s;tep, mo&s;t certainly we &s;hould have either had no &s;ettlements in America at all, or they mu&s;t have been &s;mall in extent, and precarious in their tenure, to what they are at this day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the French expedition, the country of Carolina remained without any attention from Spaniards, French or En|li&s;h, until, as we ob&s;erved in the article of Virginia, Sir Walter Raleigh projected an e&s;tabli&s;hment there. It was not in the part now called Virginia, but in North Carolina, that our fir&s;t unhappy &s;ettlements were made and de&s;troyed. Afterwards the adventurers entered the bay of Che&s;apeak, and fixed a permanent colony to the Northward; &s;o that although Carolina was the fir&s;t part of the Atlantic coa&s;t of America, which had an European colony, yet by an odd caprice it was for a long time de&s;erted by both England and France, who &s;ettled with infinitely more difficulty in climates much le&s;s advantageous or agreeable.</P>
<P>It was not until the year 1663, in the reign of Charles the &s;econd, that we had any notion of formally &s;ettling that country. In that year the earl of Clarendon lord chancel|lor, the duke of Albemarle, the lord Craven, lord Berkley, lord A&s;hley, afterwards earl of Shafte&s;bury, Sir George Carteret, Sir William Berkley, and Sir George Colleton, obtained a charter for the property and juri&s;diction of
<PB N="231" REF="233">
that country, from the 31&s;t degree of North latitude to the 36th; and being inverted with full power to &s;ettle and govern the country, they had the model of a con&s;titution framed, and a body of fundamental laws compiled by the famous philo&s;opher Mr. Locke. On this plan the lords proprietors them&s;elves &s;tood in the place of the king, gave their a&s;&s;ent or di&s;|&s;ent as they thought proper to all laws, ap|pointed all officers, and be&s;towed all titles of dignity. In his turn one of the&s;e lords acted for the re&s;t. In the province they appointed two other branches, in a good mea&s;ure ana|logous to the legi&s;lature in England. They made three ranks, or rather cla&s;&s;es of nobility. The lowe&s;t was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e to whom they had made grants of twelve thou&s;and acres of land, whom they called barons; the next order had twenty-four thou&s;and acres, or two baronies, with the title of ca&s;&s;iques; the&s;e were to an&s;wer our earls; the third had two ca&s;&s;ique&s;hips, or forty-eight thou&s;and acres, and were called landgraves, a title in that province analogous to duke. This body formed the upper hou&s;e; their lands were not alienable by parcels. The lower hou&s;e was formed, as it is in the other colonies, of re|pre&s;entatives from the &s;everal towns or coun|ties. But the whole was not called, as in the re&s;t of the plantations, an a&s;&s;embly, but a parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="234">They began their fir&s;t &s;ettlement at a point of land towards the Southward of their di&s;trict, between two navigable rivers, though of no long cour&s;e, called A&s;hley and Cowper rivers, and there laid the foundation of a city, called Charles town, which was de&s;igned to be, what it now is, the capital of the province. They expended about twelve thou&s;and pounds in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement. But it was not chief|ly to the funds of the lords proprietors, that this province owed it's e&s;tabli&s;hment. They ob&s;erved what advantages the other colonies derived from opening an harbour for refugees; and not only from this con&s;ideration, but from the humane di&s;po&s;ition of that excellent man who formed the model of their govern|ment, they gave an unlimited toleration to people of all religious per&s;ua&s;ions. This induc|ed a great number of di&s;&s;enters, over whom the then government held a more &s;evere hand than was con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice or policy, to tran&s;|port them&s;elves with their fortunes and fami|lies into Carolina. They became &s;oon at lea&s;t as numerous as the churchmen; and though they di&s;played none of that frantic bigotry which di&s;graced the New England refugees, they could not pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the jealou&s;y and hatred of tho&s;e of the church of England, who having a majority in one of the a&s;&s;emblies, attempted to exclude all di&s;|&s;enters from a right of &s;itting there. This
<PB N="233" REF="235">
produced di&s;&s;entions, tumults, and riots every day, which tore the colony to pieces, and hindered it for many years from making that progre&s;s which might be expected from it's great natural advantages. The people fell into di&s;putes of no le&s;s violent a nature with the lords proprietors, and provoking the Indians by a &s;eries of unju&s;t and violent actions, they gave occa&s;ion to two wars, in which how|ever they were victorious, and &s;ubdued almo&s;t all the Indian nations within their own bounds at this &s;ide of the Apalachian mountains.</P>
<P>Their inte&s;tine di&s;tractions, and their fo|reign wars, kept the colony &s;o low, that an act of parliament, if po&s;&s;ible to prevent the la&s;t ruinous con&s;equences of the&s;e divi&s;ions, put the province under the immediate care and in&s;pection of the crown. The lords pro|prietors making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, accepted a recompence of about twenty-four thou&s;and pounds, both for the property and juri&s;diction; except the earl Granville, who kept his eighth part of the property, which comprehends very near half of North Carolina, on that part which immediately borders upon the pro|vince of Virginia. Their con&s;titution in tho&s;e points wherein it differed from that of the other colonies, was altered; and the country, for the more commodious admini&s;tration of affairs, was divided into two di&s;tinct indepen|dent governments, called North Carolina and
<PB N="234" REF="236">
South Carolina. This was in the year 1728. In a little time a firm peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed with all the neighbouring Indian nations, the Cherokees, the Creeks, and the Cataubas; the province began to breathe from it's inter|nal quarrels, and it's trade has advanced every year &s;ince that time with an a&s;toni&s;hing rapi|dity.</P>

The climate and &s;oil in the&s;e countries, do not con&s;iderably differ from tho&s;e of Virginia; but where they differ, it is much to the advantage of Carolina, which is one of the fine&s;t climates in the world. The heat in &s;ummer is very little greater than in Virginia, but the winters are milder and &s;horter, and the year in all re&s;pects does not come to the &s;ame violent extremities. How|ever the weather, though in general &s;erene as the air is healthy, yet like all American wea|ther, it makes &s;uch quick changes, and tho&s;e &s;o &s;harp, as to oblige the inhabitants to ra|ther more caution in their dre&s;s and diet, than we are obliged to u&s;e in Europe. Thunder and lightning is here frequent; and it is the
<PB N="235" REF="237">
only one of our colonies upon the continent which is &s;ubject to hurricanes; but they are very rare, and not near &s;o violent as tho&s;e of the We&s;t-Indies. Part of the month of March, and all April, May, and the greate&s;t part of June, are here inexpre&s;&s;ibly temperate and agreeable, but in July, Augu&s;t, and for almo&s;t the whole of September, the heat is very inten&s;e; and though the winters are &s;harp, e&s;pecially when the North-We&s;t wind prevails, yet they are &s;eldom &s;evere enough to freeze any con&s;iderable water; affecting only the mornings and evenings, the fro&s;ts have never &s;ufficient &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the noon-day &s;un; &s;o that many tender plants which do not &s;tand the winter of Virginia, flouri&s;h in Caro|lina; for they have oranges in great plenty near Charles-town, and excellent in their kinds, both &s;weet and &s;our. Olives are rather neglected by the planter, than denied by the climate. The vegetation of every kind of plant is here almo&s;t incredibly quick; for there is &s;omething &s;o kindly in the air and &s;oil, that where the latter has the mo&s;t barren and unpromi&s;ing appearance, if neglected for a while, of it&s;elf it &s;hoots out an immen&s;e quantity of tho&s;e various plants and beautiful flowering &s;hrubs and flowers, for which this country is &s;o famous, and of which Mr. Ca|te&s;by is his Natural Hi&s;tory of Carolina has made &s;uch fine drawings.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="238">The whole country is in a manner one fore&s;t, where our planters have not cleared it. The trees are almo&s;t the &s;ame in every re&s;pect with tho&s;e produced in Virginia; and by the different &s;pecies of the&s;e, the quality of the &s;oil is ea&s;ily known; for tho&s;e grounds which bear the oak, the walnut, and the hickory, are extremely fertile; they are of a dark &s;and, intermixed with loam, and as all their land abounds with nitre, it is a long time before it is exhau&s;ted; for here they never u&s;e any manure. The pine barren is the wor&s;t of all; this is an almo&s;t perfectly white &s;and, yet it bears the pine tree and &s;ome other u&s;eful plants naturally, and yields good profit in pitch, tar, and turpentine from thence; and when it is cleared, for two or three years together it produces very tolerable crops of Indian corn and pea&s;e; and when it lies low and is flooded, it even an&s;wers well for rice. But what is the be&s;t of all for this province, this wor&s;t &s;pecies of it's land is favourable to a &s;pecies of the mo&s;t valuable of all it's pro|ducts, to a &s;pecies of indigo. There is another kind of ground, which lies low and wet upon the banks of &s;ome of their rivers; this is called &s;wamp, which in &s;ome places is in a man|ner u&s;ele&s;s; in others it is far the riche&s;t of all their grounds; it is a black fat earth, and bears their great &s;taple rice, which mu&s;t have in general a rich moi&s;t &s;oil, in the greate&s;t
<PB N="337" REF="239">
plenty and perfection. The country near the &s;ea, and at the mouths of the navigable rivers, is much the wor&s;t; for mo&s;t of the land there is of the &s;pecies of the pale, light, &s;andy-coloured ground; and what is otherwi&s;e in tho&s;e parts, is little better than an unhealthy and unprofitable &s;alt mar&s;h; but the country, as you advance in it, improves continually; and at an hundred miles di&s;tance from Charles-town, where it begins to grow hilly, the &s;oil is of a prodigious fertility, fitted for every purpo&s;e of human life. The air is pure and whol&s;ome, and the &s;ummer heats much more temperate than in the flat country; for Carolina is all an even plain for eighty miles from the &s;ea; no hill, no rock, &s;carce even a pebble to be met with: &s;o that even the be&s;t parts of the maritime country, from this &s;amene&s;s, mu&s;t want &s;omething of the fine effect which it's various and beautiful products would have by a more variegated and advantageous di&s;po&s;i|tion; but nothing can be imagined more plea|&s;ant to the eye than the back country, and it's fruitfulne&s;s is almo&s;t incredible. Wheat grows extremely well there, and yields a pro|digious increa&s;e. In the other parts of Carolina they rai&s;e but little, where it is apt to mildew and &s;pend it&s;elf in &s;traw; and the&s;e evils the planters take very little care to redre&s;s, as they turn their whole attention to the culture of rice, which is more profitable, and in which they are unrivalled; being &s;upplied with what
<PB N="238" REF="240">
wheat they want in exchange for this grain, from New York and Pen&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>The land in Carolina is very ea&s;ily cleared every where, as there is little or no under|wood. Their fore&s;ts con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of great trees at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance a&s;under; &s;o that they can clear in Carolina more land in a week, than in the fore&s;ts of Europe they can do in a month. Their method is to cut them at about a foot from the ground, and then &s;aw the trees into boards, or convert them into &s;taves, heading, or other &s;pecies of lum|ber, according to the nature of the wood, or the demands at the market. If they are too far from navigation, they heap them together, and leave them to rot. The roots &s;oon decay; and before that they find no inconvenience from them, where land is &s;o plenty.</P>
<P>The aboriginal animals of this country are in general the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Virginia, but there is yet a greater number and variety of beautiful fowls. All the animals of Europe are here in plenty; black cattle are multi|plied prodigiou&s;ly. About fifty years ago, it was a thing extraordinary to have above three or four cows, now &s;ome have a thou&s;and; &s;ome in North Carolina a great many more; but to have two or three hundred is very common. The&s;e ramble all day at plea&s;ure in the fore&s;ts; but their calves being &s;eparated, and kept in fenced pa&s;tures, the cows return
<PB N="239" REF="241">
every evening to them; they are then milked, detained all night, milked in the morning, and then let loo&s;e again. The hogs range in the &s;ame manner, and return like the cows, by having &s;helter and &s;ome victuals provided for them at the plantation; the&s;e are va&s;tly nume|rous, and many quite wild; many horned cattle and hor&s;es too run wild in their woods; though at the fir&s;t &s;ettlement there was not one of the&s;e animals in the country. They drive a great many cattle from North Carolina every year into Virginia, to be &s;laughtered there; and they kill and &s;alt &s;ome beef, and a good deal of pork, for the We&s;t-Indies, within them&s;elves; but the beef is neither &s;o good, nor does it keep near &s;o long as what is &s;ent to the &s;ame market from Ireland. They export a con|&s;iderable number of live cattle to Pen&s;ylvania and the We&s;t-Indies. Sheep are not &s;o plenty as the black cattle or hogs, neither is their fle&s;h &s;o good; their wool is very ordinary.</P>

<P>THE trade of Carolina, be&s;ides the lum|ber, provi&s;ions, and the like, which it yields in common with the re&s;t of America, has three great &s;taple commodities, indigo, rice, and the produce of the pine, turpentine, tar, and pitch. The two former commodities South Carolina has intirely to it&s;elf; and taking in North Carolina, this part of Ame|rica
<PB N="240" REF="242">
yields more pitch and tar than all the re&s;t of our colonies.</P>
<P>Rice anciently formed by it&s;elf the &s;taple of this province; this whol&s;ome grain makes a great part of the food of all ranks of peo|ple in the Southern parts of the world; in the Northern it is not &s;o much in reque&s;t. Whil&s;t the rigour of the act of navigation obliged them to &s;end all their rice directly to England, to be re-&s;hipped for the markets of Spain and Portugal; the charges incident to this regula|tion lay &s;o heavy upon the trade, that the cul|tivation of rice, e&s;pecially in time of war, when the&s;e charges were greatly aggravated by the ri&s;e of the freight and in&s;urance, hardly an&s;wer|ed the charges of the planter; but now the legi&s;lature has relaxed the law in this re&s;pect, and permits the Carolinians to &s;end their rice directly to any place to the Southward of Cape Fini&s;terre. This prudent indulgence has again revived the rice trade; and though they have gone largely, and with great &s;pirit into the profitable article of indigo, it has not diverted their attention from the cultivation of rice; they rai&s;e now above double the quantity of what they rai&s;ed &s;ome years ago; and this branch alone of their commerce is, at the low|e&s;t e&s;timation, worth one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling annually.</P>
<P>Indigo is a dye made from a plant of the &s;ame name, which probably was &s;o called
<PB N="241" REF="243">
from India, where it was fir&s;t cultivated, and from whence we had for a con&s;iderable time the whole of what we con&s;umed in Europe. This plant is very like the fern when grown, and when young hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable from lucern-gra&s;s; its leaves in general are pennated, and terminated by a &s;ingle lobe; the flowers con&s;i&s;t of five leaves, and are of the papi|lionaceous kind, the uppermo&s;t petal being larger and rounder than the re&s;t, and lightly furrowed on the &s;ide; the lower ones are &s;hort and end in a point; in the middle of the flower is &s;ituated the &s;tile, which after|wards becomes a pod, containing the &s;eeds.</P>
<P>They cultivate three &s;orts of indigo in Ca|rolina, which demand the &s;ame variety of &s;oils. Fir&s;t, the French or Hi&s;paniola indigo, which &s;triking a long tap root, will only flouri&s;h in a deep rich &s;oil; and therefore though an ex|cellent &s;ort, it is not &s;o much cultivated in the maritime parts of Carolina, which are generally &s;andy; but no part of the world is more fit to produce it in perfection than the &s;ame country, an hundred miles backwards; it is neglected too on another account, for it hardly bears a winter &s;o &s;harp as that of Ca|rolina.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort, which is the fal&s;e guate|mala, or true bahama, bears the winter better, is a more tall and vigorous plant, is rai&s;ed in greater quantities from the &s;ame compa&s;s of
<PB N="242" REF="244">
ground; is content with the wor&s;t &s;oils in the country, and is therefore more cultivated than the fir&s;t &s;ort, though inferior in the quality of it's dye.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort is the wild indigo, which is indigenous here; this, as it is a native of the country, an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of the planter the be&s;t of all, with regard to the hardine&s;s of the plant, the ea&s;ine&s;s of the culture, and the quantity of the produce; of the quality there is &s;ome di&s;pute, not yet &s;ettled among&s;t the planters them&s;elves; nor can they as yet di&s;|tinctly tell when they are to attribute the faults of their indigo to the nature of the plant, to the &s;ea&s;ons, which have much in|fluence upon it, or to &s;ome defect in the manufacture.</P>
<P>The time of planting the indigo, is gene|rally after the fir&s;t rains &s;ucceeding, the vernal equinox; the &s;eed is &s;owed in &s;mall &s;traight trenches, about eighteen or twenty inches a&s;under; when it is at it's height, it is gene|rally eighteen inches tall. It is fit for cutting, if all things an&s;wer, well, in the beginning of July. Towards the end of Augu&s;t a &s;econd cutting is obtained; and if they have a mild autumn, there is a third cutting at Michael|mas; the indigo land mu&s;t be weeded every day, and the plants clean&s;ed from worms, and the plantation attended with the greate&s;t care and diligence; about twenty-five negroes may
<PB N="243" REF="245">
manage a plantation of fifty acres, and com|pleat the manufacture of the drug, be&s;ides providing their own nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and that of the planter's family. Each acre yields, if the land be very good, &s;ixty or &s;eventy pounds weight of indigo; at a medium the produce is fifty pounds. When the plant is beginning to blo&s;&s;om it is fit for cutting; and when cut, great care ought to be taken to bring it to the &s;teeper, without pre&s;&s;ing or &s;haking it, as a great part of the beauty of the indigo depends upon the fine farina which adheres to the leaves of this plant.</P>
<P>The apparatus for making indigo is pretty con&s;iderable, though not very expen&s;ive; for be&s;ides a pump, the whole con&s;i&s;ts only of vats and tubs of cypre&s;s wood, common and cheap in this country. The indigo when cut is fir&s;t laid in a vat about twelve or fourteen feet long, and four deep, to the height of about fourteen inches, to macerate and dige&s;t. Then this ve&s;&s;el, which is called the &s;teeper, is filled with water; the whole having lain from about twelve to &s;ixteen hours, according to the weather, begins to ferment, &s;well, ri&s;e, and grow &s;en&s;ibly warm; at this time &s;pars of wood are run acro&s;s to prevent it's ri&s;ing too much, and a pin is then &s;et to mark the highe&s;t point of it's a&s;cent; when it falls be|low this mark, they judge that the fermen|tation has attained it's due pitch, and begins to
<PB N="244" REF="246">
abate; this directs the manager to open a cock, and let off the water into another vat, which is called the beater; the gro&s;s matter that remains in the fir&s;t vat, is carried off to manure the ground, for which purpo&s;e it is excellent, and new cuttings are put in as long as the harve&s;t of this weed continues.</P>
<P>When the water, &s;trongly impregnated with the particles of the indigo, has run into the &s;econd vat or beater, they attend with a &s;ort of bottomle&s;s buckets, with long handles, to work and agitate it; which they do ince&s;&s;antly until it heats, froths, ferments, and ri&s;es above the rim of the ve&s;&s;el which contains it; to al|lay this violent fermentation, oil is thrown in as the froth ri&s;es, which in&s;tantly &s;inks it. When this beating has continued for twenty, thirty, or thirty-five minutes, according to the &s;tate of the weather, (for in cool weather it requires the longe&s;t continued beating) a &s;mall muddy grain begins to be formed, the &s;alts and other particles of the plant united and di&s;&s;olved before with the water, are now reunited, and begin to granulate.</P>
<P>To di&s;cover the&s;e particles the better, and to find when the liquor is &s;ufficiently beaten, they take up &s;ome of it from time to time on a plate or in a gla&s;s; when it appears in an hopeful condition, they let loo&s;e &s;ome lime water from an adjacent ve&s;&s;el, gently &s;tirring the whole, which wonderfully facilitates the
<PB N="245" REF="247" MS="y">
operation; the indigo granulates more fully, the liquor a&s;&s;umes a purpli&s;h colour, and the whole is troubled and muddy; it is now &s;uf|fered to &s;ettle; then the clearer part is let to run off into another &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els, from whence the water is conveyed away as fa&s;t as it clears at the top, until nothing remains but a thick mud, which is put into bags of coar&s;e linen. The&s;e are hung up and left for &s;ome time, until the moi&s;ture is entirely drained off. To fini&s;h the drying this mud is turned out of the bags, and worked upon boards of &s;ome porous timber with a wooden &s;patula; it is frequently expo&s;ed to the morning and even|ing &s;un, but for a &s;hort time only; and then it is put into boxes or frames, which is called the curing, expo&s;ed again to the &s;un in the &s;ame cautious manner, until with great labour and attention the operation is fini&s;hed, and that valuable drug called indigo, fitted for the mar|ket. The greate&s;t &s;kill and care is required in every part of the proce&s;s, or there may be great danger of ruining the whole; the water mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to remain too &s;hort or too long a time, either in the &s;teeper or beater, the beating it&s;elf mu&s;t be nicely managed, &s;o as not to exceed or fall &s;hort; and in the curing, the exact medium between too much or too little drying is not ea&s;ily attained. Nothing but experience can make the over&s;eer &s;kilful in the&s;e matters.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="248">There are two methods of trying the good|ne&s;s of indigo; by fire and by water; if it &s;wims it is good, if it &s;inks it is naught, the heavier the wor&s;e; &s;o if it wholly di&s;&s;olves in water it is good. Another way of proving is, by the fire ordeal; if it intirely burns away it is good, the adulterations remain untouched.</P>
<P>There is perhaps no branch of manufacture, in which &s;o large profits may be made upon &s;o moderate a fund, as that of indigo; and there is no country in which this manufac|ture can be carried on to &s;uch advantage as in Carolina, where the climate is healthy, pro|vi&s;ion plentiful and cheap, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for that bu&s;ine&s;s had with the great|e&s;t ea&s;e. To do ju&s;tice to the Carolinians, they have not neglected the&s;e advantages; and if they continue to improve them with the &s;ame &s;pirit in which they have begun, and attend diligently to the quality of their goods, they mu&s;t naturally and nece&s;&s;arily come to &s;up|ply the whole con&s;umption of the world with this commodity; and con&s;equently make their country the riche&s;t, as it is the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t fertile part of the Briti&s;h domi|nions.</P>
<P>In all parts of Carolina, but e&s;pecially in North Carolina, they make great quantities of turpentine, tar and pitch. They are all the produce of the pine The turpentine is drawn &s;imply from inci&s;ions made in the tree; they
<PB N="247" REF="249">
are made from as great an height as a man can reach with an hatchet; the&s;e inci&s;ions meet at the bottom of the tree in a point, where they pour their contents into a ve&s;&s;el placed to re|ceive them. There is nothing further in this proce&s;s. But tar requires a more con&s;iderable apparatus and greater trouble. They prepare a circular floor of clay, declining a little towards the center; from this is laid a pipe of wood, the upper part of which is even with the floor, and reaches ten feet without the circumference; under the end the earth is dug away, and barrels placed to receive the tar as it runs. Upon the floor is built up a large pile of pine wood &s;plit in pieces, and &s;urrounded with a wall of earth, leaving only a &s;mall aperture at the top where the fire is fir&s;t kindled. When the fire begins to burn, they cover this open|ing likewi&s;e to confine the fire from flaming out, and to leave only &s;ufficient heat to force the tar downwards to the floor. They tem|per the heat as they plea&s;e, by running a &s;tick into the wall of clay, and giving it air. Pitch is made by boiling tar in large iron kettles &s;et in furnaces, or burning it in round clay holes made in the earth. The greate&s;t quan|tity of pitch and tar is made in North Ca|rolina.</P>

<P>THERE are in the two provinces which compo&s;e Carolina, ten naviga|ble rivers of a very long cour&s;e, and innu|merable &s;maller ones, which fall into them, all abounding in fi&s;h. About fifty or &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea, there are falls in mo&s;t of the great rivers, which as you approach their &s;ources, become more frequent. This is the ca&s;e of almo&s;t all the American rivers; at the&s;e falls, tho&s;e who navigate the&s;e rivers land their goods, carry them beyond the cata|ract on hor&s;es or waggons, and then re&s;hip them below or above it.</P>
<P>The mouths of the rivers in North Carolina form but ordinary harbours, and do not admit, except one at Cape Fear, ve&s;&s;els of above &s;eventy or eighty tons; &s;o that larger &s;hips are obliged to lie off in a &s;ound called Oca|cock, which is formed between &s;ome i&s;lands and the continent. This lays a weight upon their trade by the expence of lighterage. North Carolina, partly upon that occa&s;ion, but principally that the fir&s;t &s;ettlements were made as near as po&s;&s;ible to the capital, which lies con&s;iderably to the Southward, was greatly neglected. For a long time it was but ill in|habited, and by an indigent and di&s;orderly
<PB N="249" REF="251">
people, who had little property, and hardly any law or government to protect them in what they had. As commodious land grew &s;carce in the other colonies, people in low circum&s;tances ob&s;erving that a great deal of excellent and convenient land was yet to be patented in North Carolina, were induced by that circum&s;tance to plant to them&s;elves there. Others who &s;aw how they pro&s;pered, followed their example. The government became more attentive to the place as it became more valuable; by degrees &s;omething of a better order was introduced. The effect of which is, that though by no means as wealthy as South Carolina, North Carolina has many more white people; things begin to wear a face of &s;ettlement; and the difficulties they have lain under are not &s;o many nor &s;o great as to make us neglect all future efforts, or hinder us from forming very rea&s;onable ex|pectations of &s;eeing the trade of this country, with proper management, become a flouri&s;h|ing and fruitful branch of the Briti&s;h American commerce. That even now it is far from con|temptible, may appear by a li&s;t of their ex|ported commodities, which I &s;hall &s;ubjoin.</P>
<P>Edenton was formerly the capital of North Carolina, if a trifling village can de&s;erve that denomination; but the pre&s;ent governor Mr. Dobbs has projected one further South upon the river Neus; which, though it has the
<PB N="250" REF="252">
advantage of being &s;omething more central, is by no means equally well &s;ituated for trade, which ought always to be of the fir&s;t con&s;ide|ration in whatever regards any of the colonies. However, none of their towns are worth mentioning; the conveniency of inland navi|gation in all our Southern colonies, and the want of handicraft&s;men, is a great and almo&s;t in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle to their ever having any con&s;iderable.</P>

<P>THE only town in either of the Caro|linas which can draw our attention is Charles-town; and this is one of the fir&s;t in North America for &s;ize, beauty, and traffic. It's &s;ituation I have already mentioned, &s;o admi|rably cho&s;en at the confluence of two navigable rivers. It's harbour is good in every re&s;pect, but that of a bar, which hinders ve&s;&s;els of more than two hundred tons burthen from entering. The town is regularly and pretty &s;trongly fortified, both by nature and art; the &s;treets are well cut; the hou&s;es are large and well built, and rent extremely high. The church is &s;pacious, and executed in a very hand&s;ome ta&s;te, ex|ceeding every thing of that kind which we have in America. Here be&s;ides the &s;everal denominations of di&s;&s;enters have their meet|ing hou&s;es. It contains about eight hundred hou&s;es, and is the &s;eat of the governor, and the
<PB N="251" REF="253">
place of meeting of the a&s;&s;embly. Several hand&s;ome equipages are kept here. The planters and merchants are rich, and well bred; the people are &s;hewy and expen&s;ive in their dre&s;s and way of living; &s;o that every thing con&s;pires to make this by much the livelie&s;t and polite&s;t place, as it is one of the riche&s;t too in all America.</P>
<P>The be&s;t harbour in this province is far to the Southward, on the borders of Georgia, called Port Royal. This might give a capacious and &s;afe reception to the large&s;t fleets of the greate&s;t bulk and burthen; yet the town, which is called Beaufort, built upon an i&s;land of the &s;ame name with the harbour, is not as yet con&s;iderable, but it bids fair in time for becoming the fir&s;t trading town in this part of America.</P>
<P>The import trade of South Carolina from Great-Britain and the We&s;t-Indies, is the &s;ame in all re&s;pects with that of the re&s;t of the colonies, and it is very large. Their trade with the Indians is likewi&s;e in a very flouri&s;h|ing condition. As for it's export, both the nature of that, and it's prodigious increa&s;e, may be di&s;cerned from the following comparative tables, which let us &s;ee how much this colony has really advanced in a few years; as an at|tentive con&s;ideration of it's natural advantages mu&s;t &s;hew us how much it mu&s;t advance, if properly managed, as there is &s;carce any im|provement

export too no incon&s;iderable quantity of bea|ver, racoon, otter, fox, minx, and wild cats &s;kins, and in every &s;hip a good deal of live cattle, be&s;ides what they vend in Virginia. Both in North and South Carolina they have made frequent, but I think not vigorous nor &s;ufficiently continued efforts in the culti|vation of cotton and &s;ilk. What they have &s;ent home of the&s;e commodities is of &s;o ex|cellent a kind, as to give us great encourage|ment to proceed in a bu&s;ine&s;s which we have not taken to heart with all that warmth that it's importance in trade, and the fitne&s;s of the climate for the&s;e mo&s;t valuable articles certain|ly de&s;erves. It was a long time before this province went into the profitable trade of indigo, notwith&s;tanding a premium &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed a good many years for all that &s;hould be rai&s;ed in our plantations; the thing was at fir&s;t de&s;paired of, and it was never judged that Carolina could produce this drug; but no &s;ooner had a few &s;hewn a &s;pirited and &s;ucce&s;s|ful example, than all went into it &s;o heartily, that though it is but about &s;ix years &s;ince they began, I am informed that five hundred thou&s;and weight was made la&s;t year; and as they go on, in a very little time they will &s;upply the market with a commodity, which before we purcha&s;ed every ounce from the French and Spaniards. Silk requires &s;till more trouble, and a clo&s;er attention; as yet it proceeds with
<PB N="255" REF="257">
languor, nor will a premium alone ever &s;uffice to &s;et on foot in a vigorous manner a manu|facture, which will find great difficulties in any country, which does not abound in hands that can work for very trifling wages. The want of this advantage in Carolina, though no part of the world is fitter for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and no bu&s;ine&s;s could be &s;o advantageous to Eng|land, will for a very long time be an impedi|ment to the manufacture of raw &s;ilk, un|le&s;s &s;ome proper, well &s;tudied, and vigorou&s;ly executed &s;cheme be &s;et on foot for that pur|po&s;e; and &s;urely it is a matter worthy of a very &s;erious con&s;ideration. America is our great re&s;ource; this will remain to us when other branches of our trade are decayed, or exi&s;t no more; and therefore we ought to grudge no expence that may enable them to an&s;wer this end &s;o effectually, as one day to &s;upply the many lo&s;&s;es we have already had, and the many more we have but too much rea&s;on to apprehend in our commerce. The&s;e expences are not like the expences of war, heavy in their nature, and precarious in their effects; but when judiciou&s;ly ordered, the certain and infallible means of rich and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive harve&s;ts of gain to the late&s;t po&s;terity, at the momen|tary charge of a comparatively &s;mall quantity of &s;eed, and of a moderate hu&s;bandry to the pre&s;ent generation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. GEORGIA.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1732, the government ob&s;erving that a great tract of land in Carolina upon the borders of the Spani&s;h Florida lay wa&s;te and un&s;ettled, re&s;olved to erect it into a &s;epa|rate province, and to &s;end a colony thither. This they were the rather induced to do, becau&s;e it lay on the frontier of all our pro|vinces naked and defencele&s;s; whereas if it could be properly &s;ettled, it would be a &s;trong barrier to them all upon that &s;ide, or at lea&s;t would be &s;ufficient to protect Carolina from the incur&s;ions which the Indians, in&s;tigated by the French or Spaniards, might make upon that province. They had it likewi&s;e in their view to rai&s;e wine, oyl, and &s;ilk, and to turn the indu&s;try of this new people from the timber and provi&s;ion trade, which the other colonies had gone into too largely, into chan|nels more advantageous to the public. Laud|able de&s;igns in every re&s;pect; though perhaps the means which were taken to put them in execution, were not altogether an&s;werable.</P>
<P>That whole country which lies between the rivers Savannah and Alatamaha North and South, and from the Atlantic ocean on
<PB N="257" REF="259">
the Ea&s;t, to the great South-Sea upon the We&s;t, was ve&s;ted in tru&s;tees; at the end of that period the property in chief was to revert to the crown. This country extends about &s;ixty miles from North and South near the &s;ea, but widens in the more remote parts to above one hundred and fifty. From the &s;ea to the Apalachian mountains it is not much &s;hort of three hundred.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the original de&s;ign, the tru&s;tees re&s;olved to encourage poor people to &s;ettle in the province, which had been com|mitted to their care; and to this purpo&s;e found them in nece&s;&s;aries to tran&s;port them into a country, of which they had previou&s;ly publi&s;hed a mo&s;t exaggerated and flattering de&s;cription. In reality the country differs little from South Carolina, but that the &s;um|mers are yet hotter, and the &s;oil in the gene|ral of a poorer kind. The colony was &s;ent over under the care of Mr. Oglethorpe, who very generou&s;ly be&s;towed his own time and pains, without any reward, for the advance|ment of the &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>The tru&s;tees had very well ob&s;erved, that many of our colonies, e&s;pecially that of South Carolina, had been very much endangered both internally and externally, by &s;uffering the negroes to grow &s;o much more numerous than the whites. An error of this kind, they judged, in a colony which was not only to
<PB N="258" REF="260">
defend it&s;elf, but to be in &s;ome &s;ort a pro|tection to the others, would have been inex|cu&s;able; they for that rea&s;on forbid the im|portation of negroes into Georgia. In the next place, they ob&s;erved that great mi&s;chiefs happened in the other &s;ettlements from making va&s;t grants of land, which the grantees jobbed out again to the di&s;couragement of the &s;et|tlers; or what was wor&s;e, &s;uffered to lie idle and uncultivated. To avoid this mi&s;chief, and to prevent the people from becoming wealty and luxurious, which they thought in|con&s;i&s;tent with the military plan upon which this colony was founded, they allowed in the common cour&s;e to each family but twenty-five acres; and none could, according to the original &s;cheme, by any means come to po&s;&s;e&s;s more than five hundred. Neither did they give an inheritance in fee &s;imple, or to the heirs general of the &s;ettlers, but granted them their lands inheritable only by their male i&s;&s;ue. They likewi&s;e forbid the importation of rum into the province, to prevent the great di&s;orders which they ob&s;erved to ari&s;e in the other parts of North America, from the abu&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>The&s;e regulations, though well intended, and meant to bring about very excellent purpo&s;es, yet it might at fir&s;t, as it did afterwards ap|pear, that they were made without &s;ufficient|ly con&s;ulting the nature of the country, or the
<PB N="259" REF="261">
di&s;po&s;ition of the people which they regarded. For in the fir&s;t place, as the climate is exce&s;|&s;ively hot, and field work very laborious in a new colony, as the ground mu&s;t be cleared, tilled and &s;owed, all with great and ince&s;&s;ant toil, for their bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the load was too heavy for the white men, e&s;pecially men who had not been &s;ea&s;oned to the country. The con&s;equence of which was, that the greate&s;t part of their time, all the heat of the day, was &s;pent in idlene&s;s, which brought certain want along with it. It is true that all our colonies on the continent, even Virginia and Carolina, were originally &s;ettled without the help of negroes. The white men were obliged to the labour, and they underwent it, becau&s;e they then &s;aw no other way; but it is the na|ture of man, not to &s;ubmit to extraordinary hard&s;hips, in one &s;pot, when they &s;ee their neighbours on another, without any differ|ence in the circum&s;tances of things, in a much more ea&s;y condition. Be&s;ides, there were no methods taken to animate them un|der the hard&s;hips they endured. All things contributed to di&s;pirit them.</P>
<P>A levelling &s;cheme in a new colony is a thing extremely unadvi&s;eable. Men are &s;eldom induced to leave their country, but upon &s;ome extraordinary pro&s;pects; there ought always to be &s;omething of a va&s;t|ne&s;s in the view that is pre&s;ented to them, to
<PB N="260" REF="262">
&s;trike powerfully upon their imagination; and this will operate, becau&s;e men will never rea|&s;on well enough to &s;ee, that the majority of mankind are not endued with di&s;po&s;itions proper to make a fortune any where, let the propo&s;ed advantages be what they will. The majority of mankind mu&s;t always be indigent; but in a new &s;ettlement they mu&s;t be all &s;o, unle&s;s &s;ome per&s;ons there are on &s;uch a com|fortable and &s;ub&s;tantial footing, as to give di|rection and vigour to the indu&s;try of the re&s;t; for in every well contrived building there mu&s;t be &s;trong beams and joi&s;ts, as well as &s;maller bricks, tiles and laths. Per&s;ons of &s;ub|&s;tance found them&s;elves di&s;couraged from at|tempting a &s;ettlement, by the narrow bounds which no indu&s;try could enable them to pa&s;s; and the de&s;ign of confirming the in|heritance to the male line was an addition|al di&s;couragement. The &s;ettlers found them|&s;elves not upon a par with the other colonies. There was an obvious inconvenience in leav|ing no provi&s;ion at all for females, as in a new colony the land mu&s;t be, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, the only wealth of the family. The quantity of twenty-five acres was undoubtedly too &s;mall a portion, as it was given without any con&s;ideration of the quality of the land, and was therefore in many places of very little value. Add to this, that it was clogged after a &s;hort free tenure, with a much greater
<PB N="261" REF="263">
quit-rent than is paid in our be&s;t and longe&s;t &s;ettled colonies. Indeed through the whole manner of granting land, there appeared, I know not what low attention to the trifling profits that might be derived to the tru&s;tees or the crown by rents and e&s;cheats, which clogged the liberal &s;cheme that was fir&s;t laid down, and was in it&s;elf extremely injudicious. When you have a flouri&s;hing colony, with ex|ten&s;ive &s;ettlements, from the &s;malle&s;t quit-rents the crown receives a large revenue; but in an ill-&s;ettled province, the greate&s;t rents make but a poor return, and yet are &s;ufficient to burthen and impoveri&s;h the people.</P>
<P>The tail male grants were &s;o grievous, that the tru&s;tees them&s;elves corrected that error in a &s;hort time. The prohibition of rum, though &s;pecious in appearance, had a very bad effect. The waters in this un&s;ettled country running through &s;uch an extent of fore&s;t, were not whol&s;ome drinking, and wanted the correc|tive of a little &s;pirit, as the &s;ettlers them&s;elves wanted &s;omething to &s;upport their &s;trength in the extraordinary and unu&s;ual heat of the cli|mate, and the dampne&s;s of it in &s;everal places di&s;po&s;ing them to agues and fevers. But what was wor&s;e, this prohibition in a manner depri|ved them of the only vent they had for the on|ly commodities they could &s;end to market, lumber and corn, which could &s;ell no where but in the &s;ugar i&s;lands, and with this re&s;tric|tion
<PB N="262" REF="264">
of negroes and rum, they could take very little from them in return.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the&s;e, and &s;everal other inconveni|encies in the plan of the &s;ettlement, rai&s;ed a general di&s;content in the inhabitants; they quarrelled with one another, and with their magi&s;trates; they complained; they re|mon&s;trated; and finding no &s;atisfaction, many of them fled out of Georgia, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves where they deemed the encourage|ment better, to all the other colonies. So that of above two thou&s;and people, who had tran&s;ported them&s;elves from Europe, in a little time not above &s;ix or &s;even hundred were to be found in Georgia; &s;o far were they from increa&s;ing. The mi&s;chief grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day, until the government revok|ed the grant to the tru&s;tees, took the province into their own hands, and annulled all the par|ticular regulations that were made. It was then left exactly on the &s;ame footing with Ca|rolina.</P>
<P>Though this &s;tep has probably &s;aved the colony from entire ruin, yet it was not per|haps &s;o well done to neglect entirely the fir&s;t views upon which it was &s;ettled. The&s;e were undoubtedly judicious; and if the methods taken to compa&s;s them were not &s;o well direct|ed,
<PB N="263" REF="265">
it was no argument again&s;t the de&s;igns them&s;elves, but a rea&s;on for &s;ome change in the in&s;truments de&s;igned to put them in execution. Certainly nothing wants a regulation more, than the dangerous inequality in the num|ber of negroes and whites in &s;uch of our pro|vinces where the former are u&s;ed. South Ca|rolina, in &s;pite of it's great wealth, is really in a more defencele&s;s condition, than a knot of poor town&s;hips on the frontiers of New England. In Georgia, the fir&s;t error of ab&s;olutely prohi|biting the u&s;e of negroes, might be turned to very good account; for they would have re|ceived the permi&s;&s;ion to employ them under what qualifications &s;oever, not as a re&s;triction, but as a favour and indulgence; and by execu|ting whatever regulations we &s;hould make in this point with &s;trictne&s;s, by degrees we might &s;ee a province fit to an&s;wer all the ends of de|fence and traffic too; whereas we have let them u&s;e &s;uch a latitude in that affair, which we were &s;o earne&s;t to prevent, that Georgia in&s;tead of being any defence to Carolina, does actually &s;tand in need of a con&s;iderable force to defend it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As for the &s;cheme of vines and &s;ilk, we were extremely eager in this re&s;pect in the beginning; and very &s;upine ever &s;ince. At that time &s;uch a de&s;ign was clearly impracti|cable; becau&s;e a few people &s;eated in a wild country mu&s;t fir&s;t provide every thing for the
<PB N="264" REF="266">
&s;upport of life, by rai&s;ing of corn and breed|ing of cattle, before they can think of manu|factures of any kind; and they mu&s;t grow numerous enough to &s;pare a number of hands from that mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary employment, before they can lend &s;uch things in any degree of cheapne&s;s or plenty to a good market. But now there is little &s;aid of either of the&s;e ar|ticles, though the province is longer &s;ettled, and grown more populous. But the misfor|tune is, that though no people upon earth ori|ginally conceive things better than the Engli&s;h do, they want the unremitting per&s;everance which is nece&s;&s;ary to bring de&s;igns of con&s;e|quence to perfection. We are apt &s;uddenly to change our mea&s;ures upon any failure; without &s;ufficiently con&s;idering whether the failure has been owing to a fault in the &s;cheme it&s;elf; this does not ari&s;e from any defect pe|culiar to our people, for it is the fault of mankind in general, if left to them&s;elves. What is done by us is generally done by the &s;pirit of the people; as far as that can go we advance, but no farther. We want political regulations, and a &s;teady plan in government, to remedy the defects that mu&s;t be in all things, which depend merely on the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the people.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent Georgia is beginning to emerge, though &s;lowly, out of the difficulties that at|tended it's fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is &s;till but in|differently
<PB N="265" REF="267">
peopled, though it is now twenty-four years &s;ince it's fir&s;t &s;ettlement. Not one of our colonies was of &s;o &s;low a growth, though none had &s;o much of the attention of the go|vernment, or of the people in general, or rai&s;ed &s;o great expectations in the beginning. They export &s;ome corn and lumber to the We&s;t-Indies; they rai&s;e &s;ome rice, and of late are going with &s;ucce&s;s into indigo. It is not not to be doubted but in time, when their in|ternal divi&s;ions are a little better compo&s;ed, the remaining errors in the government cor|rected, and the people begin to multiply, that they will become a u&s;eful province.</P>
<P>Georgia has two towns already known in trade; Savannah the capital, which &s;tands very well for bu&s;ine&s;s about ten miles from the &s;ea, upon a noble river of the &s;ame name, which is navigable two hundred miles further for large boats, to the &s;econd town, called Augu&s;|ta; this &s;tands upon a &s;pot of ground of the greate&s;t fertility, and is &s;o commodiou&s;ly &s;itua|ted for the Indian trade, that from the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colony it has been in a very flouri&s;hing condition, and maintained very early &s;ix hundred whites in that trade alone. The Indian nations on their borders are the up|per and lower Creeks, the Chicke&s;aws, and the Cherokees; who are &s;ome of the mo&s;t nume|rous and powerful tribes in America. The trade of &s;kins with this people is the large&s;t

we have, it takes in that of Georgia, the two Carolinas and Virginia. We deal with them &s;omewhat in furs likewi&s;e, but they are of an inferior &s;ort.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. NOVA SCOTIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t province we have &s;ettled, or rather began to &s;ettle, upon the con|tinent of North America, is Nova Scotia. This va&s;t province, called by the French Acadie, has New England and the Atlantic ocean to the South and South-We&s;t, and the river and gulph of St. Laurence to the North and North-Ea&s;t. It lies between the 44th and 50th degrees of North latitude, and though in a very favourable part of the tem|perate zone, has a winter of an almo&s;t in&s;up|portable length and coldne&s;s, continuing at lea&s;t &s;even months in the year; to this im|mediately &s;ucceeds, without the intervention of any thing that may be called &s;pring, a &s;um|mer of an heat as violent as the cold, though of no long continuance; and they are wrapt in the gloom of a perpetual fog, even long af|ter
<PB N="267" REF="269">
the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on has commenced. In mo&s;t parts, the &s;oil is thin and barren, the corn it produces of a &s;hrivelled kind like rye, and the gra&s;s intermixed with a cold &s;pungy mo&s;s. However it is not uniformly bad; there are tracts in Nova Scotia, which do not yield to the be&s;t land in New England.</P>
<P>Unpromi&s;ing as this country is, yet neglect|ing all tho&s;e delightful tracts to the Southward, it was here that &s;ome of the fir&s;t European &s;ettlements were made. The French &s;eated them&s;elves here before they made any e&s;ta|bli&s;hment in Canada; but whatever unaccoun|table ignorance influenced their choice, the indu&s;try and vigour of that time de&s;erves our applau&s;e; for though they had infinitely more difficulties to &s;truggle with than we have at this day, and not the hundreth part of the &s;uccours from Europe, yet they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in a tolerable manner, and increa&s;ed largely; when the colony which in our days we have fixed there, if the &s;upport of the royal hand was withdrawn but for a moment, after all the immen&s;e &s;ums which have been expended in it's e&s;tabli&s;hment, would undoubtedly &s;ink into nothing. It is with difficulty it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, even encouraged and &s;upported as it is. Yet the de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony here, with whatever difficulties it might have been at|tended, was a very prudent mea&s;ure, for the French would undoubtedly have profited of
<PB N="268" REF="270">
our neglects, and have by &s;ome means got this country into their hands, to the great an|noyance of all our colonies, and to the great benefit both of their fi&s;hery and their &s;ugar i&s;lands.</P>
<P>This country has frequently changed hands from one private proprietor to the other, and from the French to the Engli&s;h nation, back|ward and forward; until the treaty of Utrecht e&s;tabli&s;hed our right in it finally; as the treaty of Aix la Chapelle confirmed it. But both were deficient in not a&s;certaining di&s;tinct|ly what bounds this province ought to have. This was left to be adju&s;ted by commi&s;&s;aries. Whil&s;t they were debating, the French built forts, and &s;ecured &s;uch a part of the province as they were re&s;olved to hold. I have not throughout this work cho&s;en to enter into ter|ritorial di&s;putes, becau&s;e they convey very little private in&s;truction, and do nothing at all towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the public rights; yet it is difficult to avoid remarking, that the line which the French have drawn in Nova Scotia, is not only not drawn by any treaty, but that it is very apparently calculated to &s;ecure them the&s;e parts of the province which they value mo&s;t, and at the &s;ame time to pay an apparent re&s;pect to the treaty of Utrecht by leaving us &s;ome part of Acadia.</P>
<P>The chief town we had formerly in this province, was called Annapolis Royal; but
<PB N="269" REF="271">
though the capital, it was a &s;mall place, wretch|edly fortified, and yet wor&s;e built and inha|bited. Here were &s;tationed the remains of a regiment, which continued there very little recruited &s;ince the reign of queen Anne; but though this place never flouri&s;hed, it &s;tood upon the very be&s;t harbour, as it is &s;aid, in North America; but it was not here, but on the South-Ea&s;t &s;ide of the penin&s;ula, that the &s;ettlement which was re&s;olved and executed with &s;o much &s;pirit at the end of the la&s;t war, was planned. This too &s;tands upon a fine harbour, very commodiou&s;ly &s;ituated, and ra|ther better than Annapolis for the fi&s;hery. The town is called Halifax from the pre&s;ent earl, to who&s;e wi&s;dom and care we owe this &s;ettlement. In 1743, three thou&s;and families, at an immen&s;e charge to the government, were tran&s;ported into this country at once, and (I think) three regiments &s;tationed there to pro|tect them from the Indians, who have al|ways &s;hewed them&s;elves our mo&s;t implacable enemies. The town is large, and for &s;o new a &s;ettlement well built. It has a good intrench|ment of timber, &s;trengthened with forts of the &s;ame materials, &s;o as to be in little danger at lea&s;t from an Indian enemy.</P>
<P>Though this town of Halifax has, all things con&s;idered, a very flouri&s;hing appearance, the adjacent country is not improved in propor|tion; the ground is very hard to be cleared;

when cleared does not produce a great deal, and labour is extravagantly dear. But this colony has &s;uffered more from the incur&s;ions of the Indians than from any thing el&s;e. Their incur&s;ions have been &s;o frequent, and attended with &s;uch cruelties, that the people can hardly extend them&s;elves beyond the cannon of the fort, nor attend their works of agriculture even there without the greate&s;t danger. The con&s;equence of this is, that they do not rai&s;e the fifth part of what is &s;ufficient to maintain them. Mo&s;t of their provi&s;ion of every &s;ort comes from New England, and they mu&s;t have &s;tarved if it were not for the fi&s;hery, which it mu&s;t be owned is not contemptible, and for &s;ome little naval &s;tores, and the pay of the garri&s;on, the &s;pending of which here is the principal u&s;e of the troops; again&s;t the Indian enemy they are of very little effect; though there are three regiments, and all the fighting men the Indians can rai&s;e in that pro|vince are not five hundred. The &s;oldiers, in|active by their confinement in their barracks, di&s;ea&s;ed for the mo&s;t part with the &s;curvy, and debilitated by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, are quite an undermatch for the activity, vigi|lance, patience, and addre&s;s of the American. A company of wood rangers kept con&s;tantly to &s;cour the country near our &s;ettlements, and a &s;mall body of Indians who might be brought at an ea&s;y rate from the friendly tribes who
<PB N="271" REF="273">
inhabit our other &s;ettlements, and encouraged by a reward for what &s;calps they &s;hould bring home, &s;ent to infe&s;t the enemy among&s;t their own habitations, would have protected our colony, and long ago exterminated the Indians, or reduced them to an u&s;eful &s;ubjection, &s;ince unfortunately we have not the &s;ecret of gaining their affections. The ea&s;y plan I have men|tioned would not have had half the expence attending it, that the maintenance of a nume|rous and almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s garri&s;on has had. A little experience will &s;hew to the mo&s;t ordinary under&s;tandings, what hardly any &s;agacity could have without it unveiled to the mo&s;t penetrat|ing &s;tate&s;man. It was a want of this expe|rience that cau&s;ed another mi&s;take of almo&s;t as bad a nature. Until the beginning of this war a number of the ancient French colony, &s;ome &s;ay ten or twelve thou&s;and &s;ouls, remained in the country, and were called and treated in a manner as a neutral people, though they ought to have been the king's &s;ubjects; but they yielded very little obedience to the crown of England, as in truth they had from us very little protection, and they were even accu&s;ed of encouraging the Indian incur&s;ions, and &s;up|plying them with arms and ammunition to annoy our people. Had we erected in their country a little fort, and in it kept a &s;mall garri&s;on, to be maintained by that people them&s;elves, appointed magi&s;trates, and made
<PB N="272" REF="274">
them know the benefit and excellency of the Briti&s;h laws, and at the &s;ame time impre&s;&s;ed them with a dread of the Briti&s;h power, we might have &s;aved many u&s;eful people to this colony, and prevented the nece&s;&s;ity (if it was a nece&s;&s;ity) of u&s;ing mea&s;ures, which, if they are not impolitic, are certainly &s;uch as an humane and generous mind is never con|&s;trained to but with regret.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Annapolis and Halifax, we have another &s;ettlement a little to the South-We&s;t of the latter, called Lunenburg. This is a branch of Germans from Halifax, who being di&s;contented at the infertility of the &s;oil there, de&s;ired to go where there was better land to be had, undertaking their own defence; ac|cordingly they &s;ettled where they de&s;ired, to the number of &s;even or eight hundred, and &s;ucceed tolerable well. Upon a tumult which aro&s;e among&s;t them, the governor &s;ent a party of &s;oldiers to protect them from their own di&s;cords, and from the enemy. This province is yet but in it's beginning, and therefore, ex|cept in pro&s;pect, can afford us no great &s;ubject matter of &s;peculation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. Newfoundland, the Bermudas, and the Ba|hamas.</HEAD>
<P>TO the Ea&s;t of this province lies the great i&s;le of Newfoundland, above three hun|dred miles long, and two hundred broad, ex|tending quite up to New Britain, and forming the Ea&s;tern boundary of the gulph of St. Laurence. This i&s;land, after various di&s;putes about the property, was entirely ceded to England by the treaty of Utrecht. From the &s;oil of this i&s;land we were far from reaping any &s;udden or great advantage; for the cold is long continued and inten&s;e; and the &s;um|mer heat, though violent, warms it not enough to produce any thing valuable; for the &s;oil, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e parts of the i&s;land with which we are acquainted, (for we are far from know|ing the whole) is rocky and barren. How|ever, it hath many large and &s;afe harbours; and &s;everal good rivers water it. This i&s;land, whenever the continent &s;hall come to fail of timber convenient to navigation, (which per|haps is no very remote pro&s;pect) will afford a copious &s;upply for ma&s;ts, yards, and all &s;orts of lumber for the We&s;t-India trade. But what at pre&s;ent it is chiefly valuable for, is the great fi&s;hery of cod, which is carried on upon tho&s;e &s;hoals which are called the banks
<PB N="274" REF="276">
of Newfoundland. In that the French and Spaniards, e&s;pecially the former, have a large &s;hare. Our &s;hare of this fi&s;hery is computed to increa&s;e the national &s;tock by three hun|dred thou&s;and a year, in gold and &s;ilver, remit|ted us for the cod we &s;ell in the North, in Spain, Portugal, Italy and the Levant. The plenty of cod, both on the great bank and the le&s;&s;er ones which lie to the Ea&s;t and South Ea&s;t of this i&s;land, is inconceivable; and not only cod, but &s;everal other &s;pecies of fi&s;h are there in abundance; all the&s;e &s;pecies are nearly in an equal plenty all along the &s;hores of New England, Nova Scotia, and the i&s;le of Cape Breton; and con&s;equently ex|cellent fi&s;heries are carried on upon all their coa&s;ts. Where our American colonies are &s;o ill peopled, or &s;o barren as not to produce any thing from their &s;oil, their coa&s;ts make us ample amends; and pour in upon us a wealth of another kind, and no way inferior to the former, from their fi&s;heries.</P>
<P>We have in North America, be&s;ides this, two clu&s;ters of i&s;lands; the Bermudas or Summer i&s;lands, at a va&s;t di&s;tance from the continent in lat. 31. and the Bahama i&s;lands. The former were very early &s;ettled, and were much celebrated in the time of the civil wars, when &s;everal of the cavalier party being oblig|ed to retire into America, &s;ome of them, in particular Mr. Waller, the poet, &s;pent &s;ome
<PB N="275" REF="277">
time in this i&s;land. Waller was extremely en|amoured with the &s;erenity of the air, and the beauty and richne&s;s of the vegetable producti|ons of the&s;e i&s;lands; he celebrated them in a poem, which is fine but unequal, which he wrote upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Bermudas are but &s;mall; not contain|ing in all upwards of twenty thou&s;and acres. They are very difficult of acce&s;s, being, as Waller expre&s;&s;es it, walled with rocks. What has been &s;aid of the clearne&s;s and &s;erenity of the air, and of the healthine&s;s of the climate, was not exaggerated; but the &s;oil could ne|ver boa&s;t of an extraordinary fertility. Their be&s;t production was cedar, which was &s;upe|rior to any thing of the kind in America. It is &s;till &s;o, though dimini&s;hed con&s;iderably in quantity, which has, as it is imagined, chang|ed the air much for the wor&s;e; for now it is much more incon&s;tant than formerly; and &s;everal tender vegetables, which flouri&s;hed here at the fir&s;t &s;ettlement, being deprived of their &s;helter, and expo&s;ed to the bleak North|erly winds, are &s;een no more.</P>
<P>The chief, and indeed only bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e i&s;landers is the building and navigating light &s;loops, and brigantines built with their cedar, which they employ chiefly in the trade between North America and the We&s;t-Indies; The&s;e ve&s;&s;els are as remarkable for their &s;wift|ne&s;s, as the wood of which they are built is
<PB N="276" REF="278">
for it's hard and durable quality. They ex|port nothing from them&s;elves but &s;ome white &s;tone to the We&s;t Indies, and &s;ome of their garden productions. To England they &s;end nothing. Formerly they made a good deal of money of a &s;ort of hats for womens wear of the leaves of their palmetto's, which whil&s;t the fa&s;hion la&s;ted were elegant; but the trade and the fa&s;hion are gone together.</P>
<P>Their whites are computed to be about five thou&s;and, the blacks which they breed are the be&s;t in America, and as u&s;eful as the whites in their navigation. The people of the Bermu|das are poor, but healthy, contented, and re|markably cheerful. It is extremely &s;urpri&s;ing that they do not &s;et them&s;elves heartily to the cultivation of vines in this i&s;land, to which their rocky &s;oil &s;eems admirably adapted; and their &s;ituation and the manner of trade they are already engaged in, would facilitate the di&s;tribution of their wine to every part of North America and the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>The Bahamas are &s;ituated to the South of Ca|rolina, from lat. 22 to 27, and they extend a|long the coa&s;t of Florida quite down to the i&s;le of Cuba; and are &s;aid to be five hundred in num|ber; &s;ome of them only mere rocks; but a great many others large, fertile, and in nothing differing from the &s;oil of Carolina. All are how|ever ab&s;olutely uninhabited, except Providence, which is neither the large&s;t nor the mo&s;t fertile.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="279">This i&s;land was formerly a receptacle for tho&s;e pirates, who for a long time infe&s;ted the American navigation. This obliged the go|vernment to erect a fort there, to &s;tation an independent company in the i&s;land, and to &s;end thither a governor. This i&s;land has at pre&s;ent not much trade, &s;ome oranges it &s;ends to North America excepted. However, in time of war it makes con&s;iderably by the prizes condemned here, and in time of peace by the wrecks, which are frequent in this labyrinth of innumerable rocks and &s;helves. This is all the benefit we derive from &s;o many large and fertile i&s;lands, &s;ituated in &s;uch a climate as will produce any thing, and which as it is never reached by any fro&s;ts, would yield in all probability even &s;ugars, of as good a &s;ort, and in as great abundance, as any i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies. Nothing more fully &s;hews the pre&s;ent want of that &s;pirit of adventure and enterprize, which was &s;o common in the two la&s;t centuries, and which is of &s;uch infinite honour and advantage to any time or nation, than that the&s;e i&s;lands &s;o &s;ituated can lie un|occupied, whil&s;t we complain of the want of land proper for &s;ugar, and whil&s;t an hun|dred pounds an acre is paid for &s;uch in the Caribbees.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. HUDSON's BAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE countries about Hud&s;on's and Baffin's Bay make the la&s;t object of our &s;peculation in America. The knowledge of the&s;e &s;eas was owing to a project for the di&s;covery of a North-We&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China. So early as the year 1576 this noble de&s;ign was conceived; &s;ince then it has been fre|quently dropped; it has often been revived; it is not yet compleated; but was never de|&s;paired of by tho&s;e who&s;e knowledge and &s;pirit make them competent judges and lovers of &s;uch undertakings. Frobi&s;her only di&s;co|vered the main of New Britain, or Terra de Labrador, and tho&s;e &s;treights to which he has given his name. In 1585 John David &s;ailed from Dartmouth, and viewed that and the more Northerly coa&s;ts; but he &s;eems never to have entered the bay. Hud&s;on made three voyages on the &s;ame adventure, the fir&s;t in 1607, the &s;econd in 1608, and his third and la&s;t in 1610. This bold and judicious navigator entered the &s;treights that led into this new Mediterranean, coa&s;ted a great part of it, and penetrated to eighty degrees twenty-three minutes into the heart of the frozen zone. His ardor for the di&s;covery, not abated by the difficulties he &s;truggled with in this empire of
<PB N="279" REF="281">
winter, and world of fro&s;t and &s;now, he &s;taid here until the en&s;uing &s;pring, and prepared in the beginning of 1611 to pur&s;ue his di&s;cove|ries; but his crew, who &s;uffered equal hard|&s;hips, without the &s;ame &s;pirit to &s;upport them, mutinied, &s;eized upon him and &s;even of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t faithful to him, and commit|ed them to the fury of the &s;eas in an open boat. Hud&s;on and his companions were either &s;wal|lowed up by the waves, or gaining the unho&s;|pitable coa&s;t which they water were de&s;troyed by the &s;avages; but his fate &s;o calamitous can|not &s;o much di&s;courage a generous mind from &s;uch undertakings, as the immortality of his name, which he has &s;ecured by having given it to &s;o great a &s;ea, will be a &s;pur to others to expect an equal honour, and perhaps with better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t voyage of Frobi&s;her an hun|dred and eight years ago, to that of captain Ellis, notwith&s;tanding &s;o many di&s;appoint|ments, the rational hopes of this grand di&s;covery have grown greater by every at|tempt, and &s;eem to &s;pring even out of our very failures. The greater &s;well of the tides in the inner part of the bay than near the &s;treights, an appearance &s;o unknown in any other in|land &s;eas, and the increa&s;e of this &s;well with We&s;terly winds, &s;eems without any other arguments to evince the certain exi&s;tence of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age as we have &s;o long &s;ought
<PB N="280" REF="282">
without &s;ucce&s;s. But though we have hither|to failed in the original purpo&s;e for which we navigated this bay, yet &s;uch great de&s;igns even in their failures be&s;tow a &s;ufficient re|ward for whatever has been expended upon them. In 1670 the charter was granted to a company for the exclu&s;ive trade to this bay, and they have acted under it ever &s;ince with great benefit to the private men who compo&s;e the company, though comparatively with little advantage to Great Britain. It is true that their trade in beavers and other &s;pecies of furs is not incon&s;iderable, and it is a trade in it&s;elf of the be&s;t kind; it's object enters largely into our manufactures, and carries nothing but our manufactures from us to procure it, and thus it has the qualities of the mo&s;t ad|vantageous kinds of traffic. The company has be&s;ides pretty large returns in deer &s;kins. It is &s;aid that the dividends of this company are prodigious; far exceeding what is gained in any of the other great trading bodies; yet their capital is &s;mall, they &s;eem little inclined to enlarge their bottom, and appear &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with that &s;pirit of jealou&s;y that pre|vails in &s;ome degree in all knots and &s;ocieties of men endued with peculiar privileges. The officers of the company have behaved to tho&s;e who wintered within their juri&s;diction in &s;earch of the North-We&s;t pa&s;&s;age one of the purpo&s;es for which the company it&s;elf was
<PB N="281" REF="283">
originally in&s;tituted) in &s;uch a manner as to give us the true&s;t idea of this &s;pirit. If I had been &s;ingular in this opinion, I &s;hould have ex|pre&s;&s;ed my &s;entiments with much greater diffi|dence; but this abu&s;e has been often and loudly complained of. It would appear a|&s;toni&s;hing that this trade has not hitherto been laid open, if in the perplexing multiplicity of affairs that engages our mini&s;try, &s;omething mu&s;t not nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s unredre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The va&s;t countries which &s;urround this bay all abound with animals, who&s;e fur is excel|lent, and &s;ome of kinds which are not yet brought into commerce; and the company is very far from any attempt to &s;tretch this trade to it's full extent. If the trade were laid open, it &s;eems of nece&s;&s;ity that three capital advan|tages would en&s;ue: fir&s;t, that the trade going into a number of rival hands, with a more moderate profit to individuals, it would con|&s;ume a much greater quantity of our manu|factures, employ more of our &s;hipping and &s;eamen, and of cour&s;e bring home more furs, and by lowering the price of that commodity at home, increa&s;e the demand of tho&s;e manu|factures into which they enter at the foreign markets; it might bring home other &s;pecies of furs than tho&s;e we deal in at pre&s;ent, and thus open new channels of trade, which in com|merce is a matter of great con&s;ideration. Secondly, this more general intercour&s;e would
<PB N="282" REF="284">
make the country better known; it would habi|tuate great numbers of our people to it; it would di&s;cover the mo&s;t tolerable parts for a &s;ettle|ment; and thus, in&s;tead of a mi&s;erable fort or two, time might &s;hew an Engli&s;h colony at Hud&s;on's Bay, which would open the fur trade yet more fully, and increa&s;e the vent of our manufactures yet further. Thirdly, this more general trade on the bay would naturally, without any new expence or trouble what|&s;oever, in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time di&s;cover to us the &s;o much de&s;ired North-We&s;t pa&s;&s;age, or &s;hew us clearly and definitively that we ought to expect no &s;uch thing. The&s;e advantages, and even yet more con&s;iderable ones, would be de|rived from laying open this trade under &s;uch proper regulations, which the nature of the object would point out of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>No colony has been hitherto attempted at Hud&s;on's Bay. The company has two in|con&s;iderable forts there. The country is every where barren; to the Northward of the bay even the hardy pine tree is &s;een no longer, and the cold womb of the earth is incapable of any better production than &s;ome mi&s;erable &s;hrubs. The winter reigns with an incon|ceiveable rigour for near nine months of the year; the other three are violently hot, ex|cept when the North-We&s;t wind renews the memory of the winter. Every kind of Eu|ropean &s;eed, which we have committed to
<PB N="283" REF="285">
the earth in this inho&s;pitable climate, has hi+therto peri&s;hed; but in all probability we have not tried the &s;eed of corn from the Nor|thern parts of Sweden and Norway; in &s;uch ca&s;es the place from whence the &s;eed comes is of great moment. All this &s;everity and long continuance of winter, and the barrenne&s;s of the earth, which ari&s;es from thence, is expe|rienced, in the latitude of 51; in the temperate latitude of Cambridge. However, it is far from increa&s;ing uniformly as you go Northward. Captain James wintered in Charlton i&s;land, in latitude 51; he judged that the climate here was to be deemed utterly uninhabitable on account of the &s;urpri&s;ing hard&s;hips which he &s;uffered; yet the company has a fort &s;everal degrees more to the Northward, where their &s;ervants make a &s;hift to &s;ub&s;i&s;t tolerably. It is called Fort Nel&s;on, and is in the latitude</P>
<P>All the animals of the&s;e countries are cloath|ed with a clo&s;e, &s;oft, warm fur. In &s;ummer there is here, as in other places, a variety in the colours of the &s;everal animals; when that is over they all a&s;&s;ume the livery of winter, and every &s;ort of bea&s;ts, and mo&s;t of their fowls, are of the colour of the &s;now, every thing a|nimate and inanimate is white. This is a &s;ur|pri&s;ing phenomenon. But what is yet more &s;urpri&s;ing, and what is indeed one of the&s;e &s;triking things that draw the mo&s;t inattentive to an admiration of the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s
<PB N="284" REF="286">
of Providence, is that the dogs and cats from England, that have been carried into Hud&s;on's bay, on the approach of winter have intirely changed their appearance, and acquired a much longer, &s;ofter, and thicker coat of hair than they had originally. As for the men of the country, Providence there, as as every where el&s;e, has given them no provi|&s;ion but their own art and ingenuity, and they &s;hew a great deal in their manner of kindling fire, in cloathing them&s;elves, and in pre&s;erving their eyes from the ill effects, of that glaring white that every where &s;urrounds them for the greate&s;t part of the year; in other re&s;pects they are very &s;avage. In their &s;hapes and faces, they do not re&s;emble the Ameri|cans who live to the Southward; they are much more like the Laplanders and Samoeids of Europe, from whom they are probably de|&s;cended. The other Americans &s;eem to be of a Tartar original.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed upon my plan the &s;urvey of the Engli&s;h colonies in America. I flatter my&s;elf that &s;o full an idea has not been given of them before in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s. By this the reader will him&s;elf be enabled to judge, for it is not my de&s;ign to preoccupy his judg|ment in the&s;e particulars, how our colonies have grown, what their vegetative principle has been, in what vigour it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, or what &s;igns of corruption appear in any of them; how far
<PB N="285" REF="287">
we have pur&s;ued the advantages which our &s;itua|tion, and the nature of the country have given us; or where we have pur&s;ued them, whether we have gone to the ultimate point. He will &s;ee how far the colonies have &s;erved the trade of the mother country, and how much the mother country has done or neglected to do to|wards their happine&s;s and pro&s;perity. Certainly our colonies de&s;erve, and would fully reward an attention of a very different kind from any that was ever yet paid to them. Even as they are circum&s;tanced, I do not in the lea&s;t he&s;itate to &s;ay that we derive more advantage, and of a better kind, from our colonies, than the Spa|niards and Portugue&s;e have from theirs, a|bounding as they are with gold and &s;ilver and precious &s;tones; whereas in ours there is no appearance at all of &s;uch dazzling and delu&s;ive wealth. But then I conceive it might be made very clear, that had they yielded us the&s;e &s;plendid metals in lieu of what they now produce, the effect would be far le&s;s to our ad|vantage. Our pre&s;ent intercour&s;e with them is an emulation in indu&s;try; they have nothing that does not ari&s;e from theirs, and what we receive enters into our manufactures, excites our indu&s;try, and increa&s;es our commerce; whereas gold is the mea&s;ure or account, but not the means of trade. And it is found in nations as it is in the fortunes of private men, that what does not ari&s;e from labour, but is
<PB N="286" REF="288">
acquired by other means, is never la&s;ting. Such acqui&s;itions extingui&s;h indu&s;try, which is alone the parent of any &s;olid riches.</P>
<P>The barbari&s;m of our ance&s;tors could not comprehend how a nation could grow more populous by &s;ending out a part of it's people. We have lived to &s;ee this paradox made out by experience, but we have not &s;ufficiently profited of this experience; &s;ince we begin, &s;ome of us at lea&s;t, to think that there is a danger of di&s;peopling our&s;elves by encourag|ing new colonies, or increa&s;ing the old. If our colonies find, as hitherto they have con|&s;tantly done, employment for a great number of hands, there is no danger but that hands will be found for the employment. That a rich, trading and manufacturing nation &s;hould be long in want of people is a mo&s;t ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition; for be&s;ides that the people within them&s;elves multiply the mo&s;t where the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence are mo&s;t certain, it is as natural for people to flock into a bu&s;y and wealthy country, that by any accident may be thin of people, as it is for the den&s;e air to ru&s;h into tho&s;e parts where it is rarified. He mu&s;t be a great &s;tranger to this country, who does not ob&s;erve in it a va&s;t number of people, who&s;e removal from hence, if they could be of any u&s;e el&s;ewhere, would prove of very little detriment to the pub|lic.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="289">I have already ob&s;erved, that the trade of our colonies de&s;erves a more particular attention than any other, not only on account of the advantages I have ju&s;t mentioned, but becau&s;e our attention is &s;ure of being &s;ufficiently re|warded. The object is in our own power; it is of a good kind; and of &s;uch extent and variety, as to employ nobly the mo&s;t inven|tive genius in tho&s;e matters. Foreign politics have &s;omething more &s;plendid and entertain|ing than dome&s;tic prudence; but this latter is ever attended, though with le&s;s glaring, yet with infinitely more &s;olid, &s;ecure, and la&s;ting advantages. The great point of our regard in America, ought therefore to be the effectu|al peopling, employment, and &s;trength of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions there; in a &s;ubordinate degree the management of our intere&s;ts with regard to the French and Spaniards. The latter we have rea|&s;on to re&s;pect, to indulge, and even perhaps to endure; and more, it is probable, may be had from them in that way, than by the violent me|thods which &s;ome have &s;o warmly recommend|ed, and &s;till urge, tho' we have had &s;ome ex|perience to convince us of their in&s;ufficiency. But the nature of the French, their &s;ituation, their de&s;igns, every thing has &s;hewn that we ought to u&s;e every method to repre&s;s them, to prevent them from extending their territo|ries, their trade, or their influence, and above all to connive at not the lea&s;t encroachment; but
<PB N="288" REF="290">
this in &s;uch a manner as not to &s;train our own &s;trength, or turn our eyes from &s;erving our|&s;elves by attempts to di&s;tre&s;s them. But as we are now in the mid&s;t of a war, until that is decided, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay any thing &s;atisfactory on our connections with French America, until we &s;ee what the next treaty of peace will do in the di&s;tribution of the territory of the two nations there.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. The Government of the Engli&s;h Colonies, and the Paper Currency.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ettlement of our colonies was never pur&s;ued upon any regular plan; but they were formed, grew, and flouri&s;hed, as accidents, the nature of the climate, or the di&s;po&s;itions of private men happened to ope|rate. We ought not therefore to be &s;urpri&s;ed to find in the &s;everal con&s;titutions and govern|ments of our colonies, &s;o little of any thing like uniformity. It has been &s;aid that there is &s;carce any form of government known; that does not prevail in &s;ome of our plantations; the variety is certainly great and vicious; but the latitude of the ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be &s;ome|what re&s;trained; for &s;ome forms they are cer|tainly &s;trangers to. To pa&s;s over &s;everal, nothing like
<PB N="289" REF="291">
a pure hereditary ari&s;tocracy, has ever appear|ed in any of them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t colony which we &s;ettled, was that of Virginia. It was governed for &s;ome time by a pre&s;ident and a council, appointed by the crown; but when the people were increa&s;ed to a con&s;iderable body, it was not thought rea&s;onable to leave them longer under a mode of government &s;o aver&s;e from that which they had enjoyed at home. They were therefore empowered to elect repre&s;entatives for the &s;everal counties into which this province is di|vided, with privileges re&s;embling tho&s;e of the repre&s;entatives of the commons in England. The per&s;ons &s;o elected form what is called the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly. This was added to the council which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and the members of which were, and to this day are nominated by the crown, as at the fir&s;t, and they are not only nominated by the crown, but hold their &s;eats during the king's plea&s;ure, as &s;ignified by his governor. They are &s;tiled honourable, and are cho&s;en from the per&s;ons of the be&s;t fortunes and mo&s;t con&s;iderable influence in the country. They form another branch of the legi&s;lature, and are &s;ometimes called the upper hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly. They an&s;wer in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the hou&s;e of peers in our con&s;titu|tion. As the lower hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly is the guardian of the peoples privileges; the coun|cil is appointed chiefly to pre&s;erve the prero|gative
<PB N="290" REF="292">
of the crown, and to &s;ecure the de|pendence of the colony; it is the more ef|fectually to an&s;wer the&s;e ends, that the mem|bers of the council are only appointed during plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When any bill has pa&s;&s;ed the two hou&s;es, it comes before the governor, who repre&s;ents the king, and gives his a&s;&s;ent or negative, as he thinks proper. It now acquires the force of a law, but it mu&s;t be afterwards tran&s;mit|ed to the king and council in England, where it may &s;till receive a negative that takes away all it's effect. The upper hou&s;e of a&s;&s;embly not only forms a part of the legi&s;lature of the colony, but it acts as a privy council to the governor, without who&s;e concurrence, he can do nothing of moment; it &s;ometimes acts as a court of chancery. This is the common form of government, and the be&s;t too that is in u&s;e in the plantations. This is the man|ner of government in all the i&s;lands of the We&s;t-Indies; in Nova Scotia; in one province of New England, and with &s;ome re&s;trictions in another; in New York, New Jer&s;ey, Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia. This form is commonly called a royal government.</P>
<P>The &s;econd form in u&s;e in our &s;ettlements in America, is called a proprietary govern|ment. At our fir&s;t planting that part of the world, it was not difficult for a per&s;on who had intere&s;t at court, to obtain large tracts of
<PB N="291" REF="293">
land, not inferior in extent to many kingdoms; and to be inve&s;ted with a power very little le&s;s than regal over them; to govern by what laws, and to form what &s;ort of con&s;titution he plea&s;ed. A dependence upon the crown of England was &s;hewn only by the payment of an Indian arrow, a few &s;kins, or &s;ome other trifling acknowledgment of the &s;ame nature. We had formerly many more governments of that &s;ort, than we have at pre&s;ent; in the We&s;t-Indies, the i&s;land of Barbadoes was granted to the earl of Carli&s;le; and we have &s;een a like grant made of the i&s;land of St. Lucia to the duke of Montague in this age, which after an infinite charge to that benevo|lent nobleman came to nothing, by a &s;ort of tacit allowance of the French claim to it. This was in 1722, when our connection with France hindered us from exerting our rights with the nece&s;&s;ary vigour. Carolina was for|merly a government of this kind, but it was lodged in eight proprietaries. How they part|ed with their rights we have &s;een already. New Jer&s;ey was likewi&s;e a proprietary go|vernment; but this too failed like the others. The only governments in this form which remain at pre&s;ent, but con&s;iderably abridged of their privileges, are Pen&s;ylvania and Mary|land. In the latter the con&s;titution exactly re&s;embles that of the royal governments; a governor, council, and a&s;&s;embly of the repre|&s;entatives
<PB N="292" REF="294">
of the people; but the governor is appointed by the proprietary, and approved by the crown. The cu&s;toms are re&s;erved to the crown likewi&s;e; and the officers belonging to them are independent of the government of the province. In Pen&s;ylvania the proprietary is under the &s;ame re&s;trictions that limit the proprietary of Maryland, on the &s;ide of the crown; on the &s;ide of the people he is yet more re&s;trained; for their legi&s;lature has but two parts, the a&s;&s;embly of the people, and the go|vernor; &s;o that the governor wanting the great influence which the council gives in other places, whenever his &s;entiments differ from tho&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly he is engaged in a very unequal conte&s;t.</P>
<P>The third form is called a charter govern|ment; this originally prevailed in all the pro|vinces of New England; and &s;till remains in two of them, Connecticut and Rhode I&s;land. By the charters to the&s;e colonies, the exorbi|tant power which was given in the proprieta|ry governments to &s;ingle men, was here ve&s;t|ed, and I apprehend much more dangerou&s;ly, in the whole body of the people. It is to all purpo&s;es a mere democracy. They elect every one of their own officers, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; they di&s;place them at plea&s;ure; and the laws which they enact, are valid without the royal approbation. This &s;tate of unbounded freedom, I believe, contributed in
<PB N="293" REF="295">
&s;ome degree to make tho&s;e &s;ettlements flouri&s;h, but it certainly contributed as much to render their value to their mother country far more precarious, than a better dige&s;ted plan would have done that might have taken in the in|tere&s;ts both of Great Britain and of the new &s;ettlement. The truth is, nothing of an en|larged and legi&s;lative &s;pirit appears in the plan|ning of our colonies; the charter govern|ments were evidently copied from &s;ome of our corporations at home, which if they are good in&s;titutions them&s;elves, yet are by no means fit to be imitated by a new people go|ing into a remote country, far from the eye and hand of the &s;upreme power. What may be an u&s;eful in&s;titution for an inferior member of &s;ome great body, and clo&s;ely united to it, may be not at all proper for a new &s;ettlement, which is to form a &s;ort of dependent com|monwealth in a remote part of the world. Here the ends to be an&s;wered, are to make the new e&s;tabli&s;hment as u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible to the trade of the mother country; to &s;ecure it's dependence; to provide for the ea&s;e, &s;afe|ty, and happine&s;s of the &s;ettlers; to protect them from their enemies, and to make an ea&s;y and effectual provi&s;ion to pre&s;erve them from the tyranny and avarice of their gover|nors, or the ill con&s;equences of their own li|centiou&s;ne&s;s; that they &s;hould not, by grow|ing into an unbounded liberty, forget that
<PB N="294" REF="296">
they were &s;ubjects, or lying under a ba&s;e &s;er|vitude have no rea&s;on to think them&s;elves Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. This is all that colonies, ac|cording to the pre&s;ent and be&s;t ideas of them, can or ought to be. The charter govern|ments had nothing of this in view, and con|&s;equently provided for it but very indiffe|rently.</P>
<P>The province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets bay, which is partly a government of this popular kind, but tempered with &s;omething more of the royal authority, &s;eems to be on &s;till a wor&s;e footing, through the one error of having no e&s;tabli&s;hed provi&s;ion for the governor; this one mi&s;chief is productive of a thou&s;and others, becau&s;e the governor in a manner is obliged to keep intrigues and devices on foot, to reconcile the various parts which he mu&s;t act, and is nece&s;&s;itated to govern by faction and cabal. Hence it is that the charges of this one govern|ment are greater than tho&s;e not only of the other provinces of New England taken to|gether, but of tho&s;e of Pen&s;ylvania and New York added to them; they are deeply in debt, they are every day plunging deeper, their taxes increa&s;e, and their trade declines.</P>
<P>It has been an old complaint, that it is not ea&s;y to bring American governors to ju&s;tice for mi&s;managements in their province, or to make them refund to the injured people the wealth rai&s;ed by their extortions. Again&s;t &s;uch
<PB N="295" REF="297">
governors at pre&s;ent there are three kinds of remedy; the privy council, the king's bench, and the parliament. The council on ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint may remove the governor; the power of the council &s;eems to extend no fur|ther. The king's bench may puni&s;h the go|vernors for their offences committed in Ame|rica, as if done in England. The power of parliament is unlimited in the ways of enquiry into the crime, or of puni&s;hing it. The fir&s;t of the&s;e remedies can never be &s;ufficient to terrify a governor grown rich by iniquity, and willing to retire quietly, though di&s;honourably, to enjoy the fruits of it. The king's bench, or any other merely law court, &s;eems equally in&s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, becau&s;e offences in government, though very grievous, can hardly ever be &s;o accurately defined as to be a proper object of any court of ju&s;tice, bound up by forms and the rigid letter of the law. The parliament is equal to every thing, but whether party, and other bars to a quick and effectual proceeding, may not here leave the provinces as much unredre&s;&s;ed as in the other courts, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine.</P>
<P>The law in all our provinces, be&s;ides tho&s;e acts which from time to time they have made for them&s;elves, is the common law of England, the old &s;tatute law, and a great part of the new, which in looking over their laws I find many of our &s;ettlements have adopted, with
<PB N="296" REF="298">
very little choice or di&s;cretion. And indeed the laws of England, if in the long period of their duration they have had many improve|ments, &s;o they have grown more tedious, per|plexed, and intricate, by the heaping up many abu&s;es in one age, and the attempts to remove them in another. The&s;e infant &s;ettlements &s;urely demanded a more &s;imple, clear, and de|terminate legi&s;lation, though it were of &s;ome|what an homelier kind; laws &s;uited to the time, to their country, and the nature of their new way of life. Many things &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the law of England, which are built upon cau&s;es and rea&s;ons that have long ago cea&s;ed; many things are in tho&s;e laws &s;uitable to England only. But the whole weight of this ill agreeing ma&s;s, which neither we nor our fathers were hardly able to bear, is laid upon the &s;houlders of the&s;e colonies, by which a &s;pirit of conten|tion is rai&s;ed, and arms offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive &s;upplied to keep up and exerci&s;e this &s;pirit, by the intricacy and un&s;uitablene&s;s of the laws to their object. And thus in many of our &s;ettle|ments the lawyers have gathered to them&s;elves the greate&s;t part of the wealth of the country; men of le&s;s u&s;e in &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments than in more &s;ettled countries, where the number of people naturally &s;ets many apart from the occu|pations of hu&s;bandry, arts, or commerce. Cer|tainly our American brethren might well have carried with them the privileges which make
<PB N="297" REF="299">
the glory and happine&s;s of Engli&s;hmen, with|out taking them encumbered with all that load of matter, perhaps &s;o u&s;ele&s;s at home, certainly &s;o extremely prejudicial in the colonies.</P>
<P>Laws them&s;elves are hardly more the ce|ment of &s;ocieties than money; and &s;ocieties flouri&s;h or decay according to the condition of either of the&s;e. It may be ea&s;ily judged, that as the ballance of trade with Great Britain is very much again&s;t the colonies, that therefore whatever gold or &s;ilver they may receive from the other branches of their commerce, makes but a &s;hort &s;tay in America. This con&s;idera|tion at fir&s;t view would lead one to conclude, that in a little time money for their ordinary circulation would be wanting; and this is ap|parently confirmed by experience. Very little money is &s;een among&s;t them, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t increa&s;e of their trade. This defi|ciency is &s;upplied, or more properly &s;peaking, it is cau&s;ed by the u&s;e of money of credit, which they commonly call paper currency. This money is not created for the conveniency of traffic, but by the exigencies of the govern|ment, and often by the frauds and artifices of private men for their particular profit. Before this invention money was indeed &s;carce enough in America, but they rai&s;ed it's value, and it &s;erved their purpo&s;e tolerably. I &s;hall forbear entering into the cau&s;es that increa&s;ed the charges of government &s;o greatly in all our
<PB N="298" REF="300">
American provinces. But the execution of pro|jects too va&s;t for their &s;trength, made large &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary. The feeble &s;tate of a colony which had hardly taken root in the country, could not bear them; and to rai&s;e &s;udden and heavy taxes, would de&s;troy the province without an|&s;wering their purpo&s;e. Credit then came in aid of money, and the government i&s;&s;ued bills to the amount of what they wanted, to pa&s;s current in all payments; and they commonly laid a tax, or found &s;ome per&s;ons willing to engage their lands as &s;ecurity for the gradual &s;inking this debt, and calling in the&s;e bills. But before the time arrived at which the&s;e taxes were to an&s;wer their end, new exigencies made new emi&s;&s;ions of paper currency nece&s;|&s;ary; and thus things went from debt to debt, until it became very vi&s;ible that no taxes which could be impo&s;ed could di&s;charge them; and that the landed &s;ecurities given were often fraudulent, and almo&s;t always in&s;ufficient. Then the paper currency became no longer to be weighed again&s;t the credit of the govern|ment, which depended upon it's vi&s;ible re|venue. It was compared to the trade, to which it was found &s;o di&s;proportionate, that the bills fell ten, twenty, fifty, and eighty per cent in &s;ome places. It was to no purpo&s;e that the government u&s;ed every method to keep up their credit, and even to compel the re|ceiving the&s;e bills at the value for which they
<PB N="299" REF="301">
were emitted, and to give no preference over them to gold and &s;ilver; they were more and more depreciated every day; whil&s;t the go|vernment every day emitted more paper, and grew le&s;s &s;ollicitous about their old bills, being entirely exhau&s;ted to find means of giving credit to the new.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to perceive how much the inter|cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t &s;uffer by this uncer|tainty in the value of money, when a man re|ceives that in payment this day for ten &s;hillings, which to-morrow he will not find received from him for five, or perhaps for three. Real money can hardly ever multiply too much in any country, becau&s;e it will always as it in|crea&s;es be the certain &s;ign of the increa&s;e of trade, of which it is the mea&s;ure, and con&s;e|quently of the &s;oundne&s;s and vigour of the whole body. But this paper money may, and does increa&s;e, without any increa&s;e of trade, nay often when it greatly declines; for it is not the mea&s;ure of the trade of the nation, but of the nece&s;&s;ity of it's government; and it is ab&s;urd, and mu&s;t be ruinous, that the &s;ame cau&s;e which naturally exhau&s;ts the wealth of a nation, &s;hould likewi&s;e be the only productive cau&s;e of money.</P>
<P>The currency of our plantations mu&s;t not be &s;et upon a level with the funds in England. For be&s;ides that the currency carries no inte|re&s;t to make &s;ome amends for the badne&s;s of
<PB N="300" REF="302">
the &s;ecurity; the &s;ecurity it&s;elf is &s;o rotten, that no art can give it any la&s;ting credit; as there are parts of New England wherein, if the whole &s;tock and the people along with it were &s;old, they would not bring money enough to take in all the bills which have been emit|ted.</P>
<P>I hope it is not too late to contrive &s;ome remedy for this evil, as tho&s;e at the head of affairs here are undoubtedly very &s;ollicitous about &s;o material a grievance. I &s;hould ima|gine that one current coin for the whole con|tinent might be &s;truck here, or there, with &s;uch an allay as might at once leave it of &s;ome real value, and yet &s;o deba&s;ed as to prevent it's currency el&s;ewhere, and &s;o to keep it within them&s;elves. This expedient has been practi&s;ed, and with &s;ucce&s;s, in &s;everal parts of Europe; but particularly in Holland, a coun|try which undoubtedly is perfectly acquainted with it's commercial intere&s;t.</P>
