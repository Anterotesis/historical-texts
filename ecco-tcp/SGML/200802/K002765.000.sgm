<P>Harlequin comes on, is &s;truck with her charms, and does every thing in his power to induce her to notice him; &s;he at la&s;t &s;ees him, falls in love with him, and they are contriving how to get at each other, when the chief Eunuch comes behind Zulma on the balcony, and forces her away.

<HEAD>SCENE IV. A Grove.</HEAD>
<P>Harlequin comes, and con&s;iders what he &s;hall do to get at Zulma; he touches the &s;tump of a tree, which turns into a writing de&s;k; he writes a

letter, and &s;huts it up again&mdash;His next idea is how to &s;end it; this he effects by turning a cy|pre&s;s into a pigeon-hou&s;e, calling down one of the pigeons, and tying the letter about his neck&mdash;He de&s;cribes that he has appointed Zulma to meet him at a mo&s;que, &s;ends the pigeon away, and goes off him&s;elf rejoicing at his project.</P>

Harlequin remedies this, by taking two va&s;es, which are or|naments to one of the hou&s;es, and drawing off into them all the wine from the jugs held by the two Jani&s;&s;aries. After this Harlequin, Zulma, the Captain, and Clown go off.&mdash;The Jani&s;&s;aries, who had been eating while the above trick was playing them, now begin to think of drinking; but before they can get the jugs to their mouths, a Dervi&s;e comes on, and &s;tops their hands&mdash;he re|pre&s;ents to them the wickedne&s;s of drinking wine; they, however, not only coax him to forgive them, but to drink with them, and at la&s;t he con&s;ents&mdash;They drink his health, and ha&s;tily take the jugs from their mouths, when, finding they have ta&s;ted nothing but water, they enquire what is the mat|ter, and, in order to convince him, they pour wa|ter from one jug to the other; he vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;es &s;urprize for a moment, but recollecting him&s;elf,

he tells them he performed the miracle to convince them of their impiety. At la&s;t they go off in a&s;to|ni&s;hment, while he laughs at their credulity, and goes off, drinking wine out of a bottle which had been concealed under his cloak.</P>
