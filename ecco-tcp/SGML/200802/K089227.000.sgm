<P>AS the following Trifle is the mere recital of a RURAL RAMBLE, when I had not time to wander from the &s;trait and common road, I hope the Reader will excu&s;e my not entering more particu|larly into the Origin of Cu&s;toms, or Date of Antiquities; tho&s;e have already been given the world by more profound and in|defatigable pens than mine;&mdash;all that I have attempted, is &s;imple incident; and if it &s;hould not be found altogether &s;uited to the mind, from the <HI>Matter,</HI> yet I flatter my&s;elf, I have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, written to <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Mode;</HI> as very few of our Fa&s;hionable Readers would wi&s;h to have the contents of a volume outla&s;t the dre&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">g of their hair, or the common po&s;t of a chai&s;e and four.</P>

<HEAD>RURAL RAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>WALKING with a friend from the bu&s;y Exchange to the forlorn St. James's, when the &s;un &s;hot down his hotte&s;t rays, and the fainting porter groaned beneath his load, I ob&s;erved that London always wore the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing a&s;pect at the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on of the year; it was July, and the gay and fa&s;hion|able part of the world was gone to
<PB N="2" REF="3">
more fa&s;hionable, or more retired re|&s;orts;&mdash;town was half de&s;erted, a li|beral face was rarely to be met, the &s;mart and &s;mirking &s;hopkeeper, who&s;e hands but a month ago were well employed in mea&s;uring out his different commodities, now &s;tood at his door with his hands tucked up behind him, his cu&s;tomers fell in, like donations to a charity, &s;low, but well received.</P>
<P>The different avenues &s;ent up their un&s;avoury odours from their different confines, and as the heat encrea&s;ed, the thicker were the ri&s;ing exhala|tions; we mutually wi&s;hed to be in the country; we challenged each other with a ramble, &s;tepped into a tavern, eat a good dinner, &s;ettled the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
propo&s;als over a bottle of wine, and put our wi&s;hes into action;&mdash;we agreed to walk or ride, as it might &s;uit us, for the &s;lower we were in our paces, the more explicit in our ob|&s;ervations; we went home, packed up our different nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;ent them off by the Tunbridge machine. We left town about five o' clock in the afternoon, took with us a faithful favourite dog, to guard and to amu&s;e us, and walked through a perpetual cloud of du&s;t and throng to Green|wich, but turning on our way to Lewi&s;ham we took our leave on't; the trees and hedges now were green|er, the country &s;tiller, and contem|plation began to fill the mind.</P>
<P>We &s;aunter'd on, and bent our way to Bromley, enjoying an unin|terrupted
<PB N="4" REF="5">
conver&s;ation, &s;ave, that now and then &s;ome view, &s;ome hou&s;e or object, broke the thread of our di&s;cour&s;e, and would oft beguile us into a plea&s;ing ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>About nine we enter'd Bromley; the evening was breaking in apace, but turning round we found there was yet light enough to view the great metropolis we ju&s;t had left behind: St. Paul's, who&s;e towering dome &s;eemed to ki&s;s the clouds, was half encircled in a bed of &s;moke; the bu&s;y bu&s;tle of the noi&s;y city, that but a few hours before almo&s;t di&s;tracted us, now was heard no more, and we plea&s;ed our&s;elves with the reflection, that we had already &s;et the greate&s;t,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
and the wealthie&s;t city in the world, at &s;o great a di&s;tance, in &s;o &s;hort a time.</P>
<P>When we had reached our inn, were &s;hewn into a room, and placed our&s;elves in &s;eparate chairs, we found, that if we had been nece&s;&s;itated to have gone farther, we &s;hould have been tired; we ordered a good &s;up|per, eat with a good appetite, went to our beds, &s;lept &s;ound, and waked in the morning without the head|ach.</P>
<P>In the morning we aro&s;e early; the &s;un &s;hone forth in all his &s;plendor, and while our breakfa&s;ts were prepa|ring, we &s;ought the church-yard, and wandered through the tombs; here and there an uncouth epitaph was
<PB N="6" REF="7">
cut, perhaps the rude production of the clerk or &s;exton; here we found but little worth our ob&s;ervation, ei|ther from its oddity, &s;entiment, or wit. But turning to take a &s;urvey of the country round us, St. Paul's again &s;tood in our way, and morning fires &s;ent up clouds of &s;moke, which &s;eemed to make their way for many miles: yonder, &s;aid I, is the greate&s;t capital in the world; there many a head is aching with its cares; there many a heart is breaking with its &s;or|rows: &s;ome full of age and avarice, cleaving to fortune like ivy to the oak, &s;craping up, with greedy anxiety, ma&s;|&s;y heaps of gold, to make them ma&s;ters, and to bear a tran&s;ient &s;way over &s;tate|man&s;ions and exten&s;ive plains; let them come here, and &s;ee how little,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
how &s;mall a &s;pot mu&s;t &s;oon &s;uffice. Here &s;tands a tomb that tells a weal|thy merchant lies within, and here are too engraved the honors that he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Mark the characters of his life.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">
<HEAD>EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<L>He was indu&s;trious to his co&s;t,</L>
<L>He ne'er a &s;ingle hour lo&s;t,</L>
<L>To &s;erve a friend, or &s;ay a prayer,</L>
<L>His bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o engro&s;s'd his care;</L>
<L>In &s;pring of age, in highth of pride,</L>
<L>His cares o'ercame him, and he dy'd.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The Scripture tells us there is a time for every thing; but this unfortu|nate man &s;eems to have been po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a different way of thinking, he wanted to be rich, and thought his time was only given him to that end. He &s;aw the golden Mammon
<PB N="8" REF="9">
in his view, and ran him&s;elf out of breath in &s;triding forth too ha&s;tily to his throne.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays my friend, that never &s;hall be the ca&s;e with me; I am rich with a competency; I am happy; riches cannot purcha&s;e more. Perhaps the mouldering cour&s;e that lays within this co&s;tly tomb, ne'er &s;pent an hour in plea&s;ing reflection, like this we now enjoy. Ne'er viewed the beau|ties of the painted meads, or &s;trayed the plains to ta&s;te the bli&s;s of health, or charms of &s;ocial conver&s;ation: but he has &s;tolen into the grave, with a dull and &s;ordid mind, that ne'er would let him look up to the &s;un. We left this con&s;ecrated clo&s;e of me|ditation, and &s;ought our inn, eat our <PB N="9" REF="11">breakfa&s;t, and made our way to Seven Oaks.</P>
<P>The country was beautifully vari|egated with hanging woods, that &s;eemed to fringe the &s;kirts of every hill; the vallies fertile, and were plentifully &s;cattered over with flocks and herds; from every rood we made on either hand, we acquired &s;ome new object.</P>
<P>About fourteen miles from Lon|don we di&s;covered a remarkable well; very wide, deep, and the water peer|le&s;s, it was near the common road, and &s;eemed to have been dug as a common convenience, to every needy thir&s;ty traveller, that might chance to pa&s;s that way. Near it &s;at, on the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
trunk of a bulky Elm, ju&s;t felled, and lopped of all its branches, one who had ju&s;t refre&s;hed him&s;elf from the cooling &s;pring, by dipping in one corner of his hat, and drinking from the other. We acco&s;ted him with en|quiries, he made replies with civility; we found him more intelligent than we had rea&s;on to expect; he &s;aid he lived in the neighbourhood, was an old inhabitant, and told us he had been informed, that the well we &s;o much admired, was dug by the Romans for the u&s;e of one part of their army, that once was &s;tationed near that &s;pot; he then bid us ob&s;erve a range of lofty trees at &s;ome di&s;tance, planted in the form of a cre&s;cent; tho&s;e, he told us, were reared to perpetuate the &s;ituation in which their tents
<PB N="11" REF="13">
were &s;aid to have been ranged, and that thereabout was &s;aid to have been fixed the &s;tandard of one of their generals, but he hone&s;tly acknow|ledged he could not remember his name, &s;aid he was fond of reading, had read much, but he was old, and his memory left him with his hairs.</P>
<P>We were plea&s;ed with his conver|&s;ation, thanked him for the little piece of hi&s;tory he furni&s;hed us with, bid him a good morning, and made the be&s;t of our way to Riverhead, where we no &s;ooner wi&s;hed to re&s;t, than we found our&s;elves invited by a whim&s;ical illiterate triplet, written under the &s;ign of the maiden|head:<Q><PB N="12" REF="14">
<L>Gemmen if you have any</L>
<L>Pray &s;top and &s;pend one penny</L>
<L>With poor Tom Lemmy.</L></Q></P>
<P>The hou&s;e is lowly, has a thatch'd roof, yet it is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, about &s;ixty paces from the road; the walls were built of clay, the landlord humble, and &s;eems to place his dependance on cottage cu&s;tomers, or frugal country travellers; we paid our attention to the invitation on his &s;ign, a&s;ked what he &s;old, he told us, ale of his own brewing, and challenged the whole pari&s;h in re&s;pect to its good body, and &s;ound qualities; he &s;ometimes made an effort at a joke, therefore, we put him on his mettle, chafed him with rugged que&s;tions, but, we found from his replies, he was com|po&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="15">
of &s;o &s;oft a texture, that the coalition of his retorts, with our &s;im|ple interrogatives, could not produce one &s;park of wit; then we &s;ate us down upon a bench under a &s;pread|ing tree, that &s;hades his hou&s;e, ta&s;ted of his ale, which was very good, we prai&s;ed it, but &s;oon di&s;covered, that though he had not much to boa&s;t of in re&s;pect of wit, he had more of cunning, for he advi&s;ed us to have a &s;econd tankard, which we refu&s;ed; "What," &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not any more? why, can you have too much of a good thing?"</Q> at which &s;aying he was &s;o plea&s;ed with him&s;elf, that he laughed immoderately; we told him we had drank ale enough, had &s;wal|lowed too many bad jokes, and that when we might happen to come that
<PB N="14" REF="16">
way again, we would thank him for his ale, but he might keep his wit for other company; this, we found, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ruffled the poor old man, &s;o, to &s;hew we did not mean to wage a war of words, we &s;hook hands, and parted.</P>
<P>We arrived at Sevenoaks about noon, where we dined, took a &s;urvey of the ancient &s;eat of his Grace the Duke of Dor&s;et; the park is beau|tifully variegated with lakes and clamps of lofty trees, in different parts, very judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed; the hou&s;e has a venerable and magnifi|cent appearance, but we had not an opportunity to &s;ee the interior excel|lences. The road, for &s;ome miles, is made uncommonly plea&s;ant by the
<PB N="15" REF="17">
embowering trees that &s;helter it from the &s;un; &s;ometimes from &s;ide to &s;ide they form a lofty arch, and then a break pre&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> it&s;elf, and &s;hews the hou&s;e in a different point of view, furni&s;hing the traveller with a plea|&s;ing variety of &s;cenes.</P>
<P>We had walked almo&s;t to Tun|bridge town, I believe it might have been at three miles di&s;tance, a guide|po&s;t was fixed at the corner of a lane, telling us it was a road to Tunbridge-Wells, but we &s;oon found that it was a road that led us four or five miles out of our way; however, we arrived at a village about two miles out of the great high road; it was plea&s;ant, very retired, the inhabitants were exceeding ru&s;tic and civil; there was
<PB N="16" REF="18">
a beautiful old church, a neat and decent place of entertainment; the &s;un was near his &s;etting, and the cricketers were at play upon a &s;mooth and level green; the clack of the mill, and the &s;ign at the public hou&s;e, brought to my remembrance the old ballad:<Q><L>" At the &s;ign of the hor&s;e, near the foot of the hill."</L></Q></P>
<P>We refre&s;hed our&s;elves here, and got in&s;tructed in our way to Tun|bridge; the &s;un was now gone down, it was about five miles we had to go through the mo&s;t delightful mea|dows; the river was our guide, on the banks of which we walked, and found out Tunbridge, as Queen
<PB N="17" REF="19">
Eleanor did her way through the meandering bower, by a clue of thread, &s;o we by the winding &s;tream;&mdash;the &s;tars began to twinkle, the reed-&s;parrows &s;ung upon the willows; at length the moon broke gravely through the clouds, and glimmered in the gliding &s;tream.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the town of Tunbridge, we gave a good look-out for the be&s;t inn; we fixed upon one that wore the be&s;t external appear|ance, but as to the entertainment within, I believe I &s;hall not be tempt|ed to vi&s;it it any more; we ordered &s;upper, and out of many things, we hardly found one that was fit to eat; the wine &s;o bad, that we contented our&s;elves with making it into humble
<PB N="18" REF="20">
negus, and improved it with lemon, water, and &s;ugar; our bed rooms dirty, as were our &s;heets; our beds were hard: in the morning when we had eat a breakfa&s;t, compo&s;ed of rank butter, coar&s;e &s;ugar, and ill-flavoured tea, the ho&s;te&s;s made a good conclu|&s;ion, by bringing in a long and ex|travagant bill, which brought to our minds what Moody &s;ays in the Jubi|lee of Shake&s;peare; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We had no|thing to eat, and paid double for that too."</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ate off in the morning for the Wells, which are five miles from the town, which we had no &s;ooner left, than we found we had gradually to a&s;cend the road to the top of a hill for near two miles, which was
<PB N="19" REF="21">
richly fertilized with corn, wood, and pa&s;ture; from the &s;ummit of which we had a mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;pect through mo&s;t parts of Kent, part of Surry and Su&s;&s;ex; the view was beau|tifully ornamented with different &s;eats, &s;urrounded with parks, villages, churches, with their taper &s;pires, and gla&s;&s;y rivers gli&s;tening in their val|lies. Walking on a few miles farther, through &s;uch a country as I have de&s;cribed, we reached the gay, ro|mantic, Tunbridge Wells.</P>
<P>They are in a bottom, &s;urrounded by hills or mounts; Mount Ephraim, Mount Sion, Mount Mi&s;ery, &amp;c. From the pump-room runs a terras of near a thou&s;and feet, on which is built a light and airy piazza, that
<PB N="20" REF="22">
the gentry in rainy weather may walk and talk without being wet; under the piazza are ranged all kind of &s;hops; book&s;ellers, confectioners, milleners, fruiterers, apothecaries, Tunbridge wares, &amp;c. There are two &s;ets of public rooms, very hand&s;ome and convenient, Pinchbeck's and Fry's; likewi&s;e, an orche&s;tra erected in the centre of the place, in which there is a tolerable band of mu&s;ic employed to play while the company are upon the walks; there &s;eems to be a greater harmony in this than any other watering-place I know; per|haps this may proceed from its being more compact, that the company are brought more together than at any other place, or that the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies is a more &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="21" REF="23">
man, or that he has le&s;s of a cox|comb about him than &s;ome I could mention, who would WADE through thick or thin to get to a gaming table, in&s;tead of attending to their company, or their friends; whatever it may proceed from, it is mo&s;t cer|tainly one of the plea&s;ante&s;t and mo&s;t agreeable places of its kind; there are two good inns, one I never vi&s;it|ed, but that which I made my quar|ters, (the Angel) had the mo&s;t gen|tleman-like civil ho&s;t, I ever met with.</P>
<P>The lodging-hou&s;es are whim&s;i|cally &s;eattered round the hills, &s;ome on a declivity, which open to the village with a plea&s;ing &s;lope; each hou&s;e has its grove, or garden an|nexed
<PB N="22" REF="24">
to it: &s;everal per&s;onages of di&s;tinction make this their &s;ummer re&s;idence, having di&s;tinct and elegant villas of their own.</P>
<P>About a mile from the Wells there are a range of rocks, fanta&s;ti|cally ranged; when you &s;tand in the valley below them, they repre&s;ent a fleet of &s;tately men of war all a|brea&s;t, bearing down upon the &s;pec|tator; the tops of them are decorated with beautiful &s;hrubs, and from out the different crannies &s;hoot the birch and beach; from the &s;ummit of &s;ome &s;tands towering a &s;tately elm, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a little fancy, may be often thought to bear a good re&s;emblance of a ma&s;t, and the &s;preading branches hang like the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
furled &s;hrouds. They are mo&s;tly &s;eparated by different i&s;les or avenues; in &s;ome places they repre&s;ent the ruins of an old cathedral. As we were pa&s;&s;ing through one of the avenues, we di&s;covered the following in&s;crip|tion, well chi&s;elled out upon one &s;ide of the rock, dated near an hundred years ago.<Q><LG TYPE="inscription">
<HEAD>INSCRIPTION.</HEAD>
<L>Stop, pa&s;&s;enger, and read:</L>

<L>He from the rock's dread &s;ummit fell,</L>
<L>Strike with thy &s;tick and ring his knell.</L>
</LG>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>We in&s;tantly &s;truck our canes again&s;t the &s;ides of the rock, and, whether it was from the dro&s;&s;y nature of the &s;tone, or from its reverberat|ing
<PB N="24" REF="26">
from &s;ome particular cell, we could not determine, however, it produced a &s;ound &s;imilar to that of a bell. We climbed to the top, and took a full &s;urvey of one of the mo&s;t beautiful and romantic vallies we ever &s;aw: the flocks were making to their fold; the moon was ri&s;ing maje&s;tically on the left, and a faint glimmering of the lamps at Tun|bridge Wells, were &s;een upon our right: it was an a&s;&s;embly night, and we could &s;ometimes hear the buzzing of the gay <HI>beau monde,</HI> hurrying to their revels; the con|tra&s;ted &s;cenes urged me to reflection, and placing my&s;elf on the root of an old tree, near the corner of a rock, I pencilled down the following &s;tanzas:</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="29">We took our leave of Tunbridge Wells, but had previou&s;ly made en|quiry of a farmer whom we met plodding near the rocks the preceding day, what accomodations he thought we might meet with at Boar's-head|&s;treet, a &s;traggling village five miles from the Wells, and in our road to Brighthelm&s;tone; he told us there was a <HI>maen</HI> good hou&s;e, called the Boar's-head, and gave us to under|&s;tand, the man who kept it was a friend of his, and would u&s;e us well if we made u&s;e of his name; we thanked him, and re&s;ted confidently on his information; the weather was warm, &s;o purpo&s;ed getting there be|tween tea and &s;upper, to avoid, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the expence of lodg|ing

at the Wells; for beds are dear, very dear, at this place: according|ly we &s;at out, enjoying the &s;weet &s;e|renity of the evening, and arrived at this &s;eemingly de&s;erted village, about nine o'clock, comforting our|&s;elves that we had made an end of our journey; then enquired for the Boar's-head, which we, according to the farmer's tale, &s;uppo&s;ed a toler|able inn, but, to our mutual mortifi|cation, found it nothing but a humble pot hou&s;e, and the landlord and his wife, for want of cu&s;tom, were gone to bed; however, we were determined not to be too precipitate|ly prejudiced by external appear|ances, which is too generally the ca&s;e, &s;o knocked at the door, for our predicament made us flatter our|&s;elves,

<P>When we had, with weary paces, plodded about a mile from this in|ho&s;pitable dwelling, the road, though it was night, was &s;till made darker by the gloomy curtain of a wood;&mdash;there was a friendly &s;tile at the en|trance of an avenue, that &s;eemingly

tumbled out of bed; this rai&s;ed the re&s;t of the family, who, with a friendly interference, convinced them they were both in the wrong; and after &s;ome little wailing of the wife, the hu&s;band was &s;oftened into pity, they ki&s;&s;ed, and made it up, and we pur&s;ued our journey; when we reached Uckfield we were &s;o tired, that we were determined to go no further.

<L>Ju&s;t after &s;he'd pickl'd her&s;elf in the &s;ea,</L>
<L>She gap'd, and &s;he yawn'd, and &s;aid it was &s;trange,</L>
<L>That the &s;ea &s;hould have made &s;uch a wonderful change:</L>
<L>She ro&s;e to the gla&s;s her old tre&s;&s;es to plume,</L>
<L>Then &s;mil'd on her&s;elf, and &s;he fancied a bloom;</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="61">
Lord Saunter was there, like her&s;elf in decay,</L>
<L>Who came down to wa&s;h all his humours away;</L>
<L>Pray my good lord, &s;aid my lady Fal-lal,</L>
<L>Don't you think it a heaven, compar'd to Pall mall?</L>
<L>What tho' we've no park, nor a tree to be &s;een,</L>
<L>But yet there's that little &s;weet level, the Styene.</L>
<L>'Tis a damnable town, &s;ays my lord, you'll agree,</L>
<L>But then, &s;ays my lady, my lord, there's the &s;ea.</L>
<L>Then, &s;ays my lord, in a jocular &s;train,</L>
<L>I don't think I ever &s;hall <HI>&s;ea</HI> it again.</L>
<L>At length then the thread of the &s;ubject to break,</L>
<L>My lady propos'd &s;ome excur&s;ion to take;</L>
<L>For time &s;eems to hang here mo&s;t &s;adly on hand,</L>

Ods bobs, &s;ays my lord, there's a raffle on foot,</L>

<L>You'd have laugh'd to have &s;een 'em, or amble or hop,</L>
<L>With a heart full of glee, to the book|&s;ellers' &s;hop;</L>
<L>The book&s;ellers &s;hop is the change of this place,</L>

Sir Chri&s;topher Croaker, with &s;pindles &s;o taper,</L>
<L>Sat &s;quinting thro' &s;pectacles over a paper;</L>
<L>Then all of a &s;udden began he to croak,</L>
<L>This war with the Congre&s;s, by G-d is no joke;</L>
<L>Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a new-married dame,</L>
<L>Who was deeply engag'd with the Temple of Fame,</L>

<L>A-propos, &s;he continued, pray what do you &s;ay;</L>
<L>Now you talk of a ball, will you go to the play?</L>
<L>Sir Chri&s;topher in&s;tantly, &s;eiz'd with the dumps,</L>
<L>He threw down his paper, and took to his &s;tumps:</L>
<L><PB N="64" REF="64">
He wonder'd how people could e'er think of plays,</L>
<L>In the&s;e terrible, trouble&s;ome, critical, days.</L>
<L>A new face appear'd in a &s;mart riding hat;</L>
<L>The whi&s;per was in&s;tantly&mdash;Pray who is that?</L>

<L>" Don't you think &s;he is pretty?" yes, without grace;</L>
<L>All beauty, you know, is not centr'd in face:</L>
<L>Do but ob&s;erve how &s;he carries her arms,</L>
<L>And yet the poor &s;impleton fancies &s;he charms.</L>
<L>If &s;he looks for a fortune, cries one with a &s;coff.</L>
<L>She may wait till &s;he's tir'd before &s;he goes off.</L>

Though &s;he that &s;aid this, will, perhaps, lay her&s;elf,</L>

<L>She was old, and as ugly as envy could make her,</L>
<L>As fine as a Bell-hor&s;e, as &s;tiff as a quaker:</L>
<L>And, what is &s;till wor&s;e, I am &s;orely a|fraid,</L>
<L>She's likely, poor lady, to die an old maid!</L>
<L>Mi&s;s Mundungus came in, and a prettier face,</L>
<L>I'll venture to &s;ay, was ne'er &s;een in the place;</L>
<L>So dimpled, &s;o blooming, &s;o &s;miling, and young,</L>
<L>And then when &s;he &s;poke, &s;uch a mu&s;i|cal tongue!</L>
<L>I could&mdash;that I could!&mdash;but I won't tell you now&mdash;</L>
<L>Odds-bobs, I'd forgot, there was Billy, the beau,</L>

With his R-&s;e by his &s;ide, you &s;carcely would think it,</L>
