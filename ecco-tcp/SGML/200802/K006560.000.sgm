<L>Sweet Poet of nature, dear Gold&s;mith, adieu!</L>
<L>As I witne&s;s'd thy worth, to thy fame I'll be true:</L>
<L>The tear of &s;oft feeling mo&s;t &s;urely will &s;tart,</L>
<L>He mu&s;t reach the warm bo&s;om who writes to the heart;</L>

<L>The Mu&s;es already have wept on thy bier.</L>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF Doctor <HI>Oliver Gold&s;mith.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_TO write the life of Dr. Gold&s;mith, is far from being a laborious ta&s;k, &s;ince little more is required than to give a tran&s;cript of the faire&s;t pages of the human mind: to have known Shen&s;tone, Cunning|ham, and Gold&s;mith, is to have been happy in an acquaintance with the brighte&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Land|&s;cape of Humanity</HI>; but to have &s;een one of the&s;e amiable pictures, is to have &s;een them all, abating for that &s;light difference in the colouring which became nece&s;&s;ary from the different points of view, in which the pictures were to be placed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">The virtues of Dr. Gold&s;mith's mind, will long be con&s;picuous in his <HI>written page</HI>; and the reader will be warmed with the glowing graces, which, at once, animate and develope the &s;oul of the author.</P>
<P>I know not if the ob&s;ervation was ever made, but I believe it will be found true, that when great abilities are united with very great virtues, if the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hould be a writer at all, he will be a poet, and, if a poet, a very excellent one: in that ca&s;e (as Cunningham &s;ings)
<Q><L><HI>We &s;hall mark in his elegant lines,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The graces that glow in his mind.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I fancy if we were to try all the living writers by this &s;tandard, we &s;hould be able to form a more ju&s;t opinion of their real characters as men, than by any other criterion. It is true, at lea&s;t with regard to the literary men within the circle of my knowledge, that in proportion to the virtues of their minds, is the elegance of their writings; and that there is not a fool, or a wor&s;e character among them, that may not be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the turgidity of his &s;tyle, and the <HI>con&s;equential nothing|ne&s;s</HI> of his phra&s;e.</P>
<P>Who could he&s;itate a moment to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the manly dignity of &s;tyle of the poet, who&s;e lo&s;s we now lament, and the frippery bomba&s;t of a Murphy or a Kelly?&mdash;But the difference lay
<PB N="3" REF="4">
chiefly <HI>in the mind</HI>; and the one was exactly as much a better writer than the others, as a better man.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation that Dr. Gold&s;mith has made in his Vicar of Wakefield, that <HI>Where the mind is ca|pacious, the affections are good.</HI> I believe that the re|mark is founded in the laws of nature.&mdash;God is infinite in wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.&mdash;What is genius but an emanation of the divine beam? Know you a man di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t of his ac|quaintance for the frigid narrowne&s;s and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of his &s;oul?&mdash;depend on it he is remarkably de|ficient in point of intellect: he may have much cunning; but he has no wi&s;dom. On the contrary, know you a man of a warmer heart?&mdash;re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that he has a clearer head, than tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to that &s;ublime feeling which does honour to humanity.</P>
<P>If there be an <HI>apparent</HI> exception to this rule, (and &s;uch may be found) it mu&s;t be attributed to that commerce with mankind, which will, in &s;ome degree, contaminate the pure&s;t &s;entiments; but even under all appearances of variation, the latent principles of the mind need only to be drawn forth, to appear the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Ro&s;common, in Ireland, claims the honour of Dr. Gold&s;mith's birth. His father, who was a gentleman of a &s;mall e&s;tate, had nine &s;ons, of whom Oliver was the third. He was born in the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
year 1731, received a good cla&s;&s;ical education, and was intended for holy orders. With this view he was &s;ent with his brother Henry to Trinity College, Dublin, in the year 1739, where he obtained a Bachelor's Degree: but his brother's merit, on leaving the College, not being rewarded with any preferment in the church, our author was advi&s;ed to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, which he commenced, by attending &s;everal cour&s;es of anatomy in Dublin.</P>
<P>In the year 1751, he left Dublin and went to Edinburgh, where he pro&s;ecuted the &s;tudy of medi|cine, under &s;everal celebrated profe&s;&s;ors of that univer&s;ity; but he had not re&s;ided long in Scotland, before he began to feel the ill effects of his un|bounded benevolence; and he was at length ab&s;o|lutely obliged to leave the country, to avoid a pri&s;on; for he had bound him&s;elf to pay a larger &s;um for a friend, than the narrowne&s;s of his finances would enable him to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>It was in the beginning of the year 1754, that he quitted Edinburgh; but he had no &s;ooner reached Sunderland, than he was arre&s;ted for the amount of his bond; but he was happily relieved from his di&s;tre&s;s, by the humanity of Dr. Sleigh and Mr. Laughlin Maclane.</P>
<P>The debt being di&s;charged, our ingenious philan|thropi&s;t embarked on board a Dutch ve&s;&s;el, bound for Rotterdam, in which place he continued but a &s;hort time, and then went to Bru&s;&s;els. He now
<PB N="5" REF="6">
made the tour of a con&s;iderable part of Flanders, took the degree of Bachelor of Phy&s;ic at Louvain, and thence went through Swit&s;zerland to Geneva, in company with an Engli&s;h gentleman, whom he had made an acquaintance with in the cour&s;e of his travels in Flanders.</P>
<P>When our poet &s;ailed from England, he was al|mo&s;t de&s;titute of money, &s;o that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of travelling on foot, or declining a journey in which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf much &s;atisfaction, from a review of the cu&s;toms and manners of dif|ferent countries. Mr. Gold&s;mith was at this period in good health, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;trength of con&s;titution, and a vigour of mind, which bid defiance to danger and fatigue. He was a tolerable proficient in the French language, and played on the German flute with a degree of ta&s;te &s;omething above mediocrity. Thus qualified, he travelled on, anxious to gratify his curio&s;ity, and doubtful of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence; his cla&s;&s;ical knowledge, however, afforded him occa&s;ional entertainment in the religious hou&s;es; while his mu&s;ical talents continued to feed and lodge him among the merry poor of Flanders, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Doctor, in relating the hi&s;tory of this part of his travels, would &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I approached a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e in the evening, I played one of my mo&s;t merry tunes; which procured me not only a lodging, but &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the fol|lowing
<PB N="6" REF="7">
day: but I mu&s;t own, that when I attempted to entertain per&s;ons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance contempt|ible, nor ever made me any return for my endeavours to plea&s;e them."</Q></P>
<P>Our author evidently refers to the&s;e circum&s;tances of his life, in the following lines in his Traveller:
<Q><L><HI>To kinder &s;kies, where gentler manners reign,</HI></L>
<L><HI>I turn; and France di&s;plays her bright domain;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Gay &s;prightly land of mirth and &s;ocial ea&s;e,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Pleas'd with thy&s;elf, whom all the world can plea&s;e;</HI></L>
<L><HI>How often have I led thy &s;portive choir,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With tunele&s;s pipe, be&s;ide the murmuring Loire?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where &s;hading elms along the margin grew,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And fre&s;hen'd from the wave the zephyr flew;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And haply, though my har&s;h touch faltering &s;till,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But mock'd all tune, and marr'd the dancer' &s;kill;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet would the village prai&s;e my wonderous power,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And dance, forgetful of the noon-tide hour.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Alike all ages; dames of ancient days</HI></L>
<L><HI>Have led their children through the mirthful maze;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And the gay grand&s;ire, &s;kill'd in ge&s;tic lore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Has fri&s;k'd beneath the burthen of three-&s;core.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith had not been long at Geneva, when a young fellow arrived there, to whom he was recommended as a Tutor, in his travels through the re&s;t of Europe. This youth having had a large fortune left him by his uncle, (a pawnbroker in London) re&s;olved to improve him&s;elf by travel;
<PB N="7" REF="8">
but, as avarice was his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;aw little more of the the curio&s;ities of the continent, than are to be &s;een without expence. He was con|tinually remarking how extravagant were the ex|pences of travelling, and perpetually contriving methods of retrenching them: &s;o that it is not to be wondered if our author and his pupil parted, which they did at Mar&s;eilles, where the latter em|barked for England, happy to &s;ave money rather than to gain knowledge.</P>
<P>There was, at this time, but a &s;mall balance due to Gold&s;mith, who was once more left to &s;truggle with adver&s;ity. He now wandered alone through the greater part of France, till, having gratified his cu|rio&s;ity, and &s;ufficiently experienced tho&s;e inconve|niencies attennding the almo&s;t pennyle&s;s traveller, he &s;ailed for England, and arriving at Dover to|wards the latter end of the year 1758, he ha&s;tened immediately to London, where he found him&s;elf a perfect &s;tranger, with &s;carce a &s;hilling in the world.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ituated, he began to be extremely unea&s;y. His friend, Dr. Sleigh, now re&s;ided in London; Gold&s;mith enquired him out, and was received with every mark of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. An offer was now made him of the place of U&s;her at Dr. Milner's Academy at Peckham; and this he eagerly acceped, unwilling to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the bounty of Dr. Sleigh.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">About this period, he wrote &s;ome critici&s;ms for the Monthly Review; which meeting with high approbation, Mr. Griffiths (the proprietor) engaged him to &s;uperintend that publication; he therefore repaired to London, and commenced Author in form. This was in the year 1759, when he wrote a few pieces, and but a few, for the Book&s;ellers: and though his pay was, as it me|rited, greater than that of many other writers, it was neverthele&s;s very di&s;proportionate to the merit of &s;uch a <HI>writer,</HI> and &s;till farther below the me|rit of &s;uch a <HI>man</HI> as Dr. Gold&s;mith: yet were not the book&s;ellers, his employers, worthy of cen&s;ure, as his name was not known to the public, and his e&s;&s;ays and poems were in&s;erted among the pro|mi&s;cuous croud, in magazines, and other periodi|cal publications.</P>
<P>It was at this period that the Doctor became ac|quainted with the late Mr. Newberry, who being a proprietor of the Public Ledger, our poet was engaged as a writer in that paper, then newly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, in which he publi&s;hed a &s;eries of valuable letters, which have been &s;ince printed in volumes, under the title of the <Q REND="inline">"Citizen of the world."</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto the Doctor had lodged, much in the &s;tile of a poor author, in Green-arbor Court in the Old Bailey; but he now got better apartments in Wine-Office Court, Fleet-&s;treet, and a &s;ummer lodging at Canonbury Hou&s;e, I&s;lington, where he continued
<PB N="9" REF="10">
a con&s;iderable time, and then removed, fir&s;t to the King's Bench Walks, and afterwards to Brick Court, in the Temple, where he died.</P>
<P>With the publication of the <HI>Traveller,</HI> our au|thor's literary fame began to encrea&s;e very fa&s;t, and it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the appearance of the <HI>Vicar of Wakefield</HI>; for he was now equally and ju&s;tly e&s;teemed both as a poet and novelli&s;t; he had been before known for a good critic; and he has &s;ince &s;hone as a learned hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>The publication of the Vicar of Wakefield was &s;ucceeded by that of the Comedy of the <HI>Good-na|tured Man,</HI> which was performed nine nights at Covent Garden Theatre; but did not meet with an applau&s;e equal to its merit; though it was far from being ill-received.</P>
<P>The next piece of any con&s;equence that our author pre&s;ented the world with, was his <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> a poem abounding in nature, truth, ele|gance and benevolence. A circum&s;tance re&s;pect|ing the &s;ale of the copy of this piece, marks very &s;trongly the author's &s;implicity of mind, and un|bounded goodne&s;s of heart. The manu&s;cript having been delivered to the book&s;eller, he gave the Doctor his note of hand for one hundred gui|neas, for the copy-right. The Doctor mentioned this circum&s;tance the &s;ame day to a gentleman, who &s;aid he thought it a large &s;um for &s;o &s;mall a piece. <Q REND="inline">"In truth, &s;aid the poet, I think &s;o too, nor
<PB N="10" REF="11">
have I been ea&s;y &s;ince I received it; I will therefore go and return him his note."</Q>&mdash;This he actually did, leaving the payment to the book&s;eller's ho|nour, when the &s;ale &s;hould inform him what he might afford to give.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the Doctor's la&s;t comedy, <HI>She &s;toops to Conquer,</HI> is too generally known to need being mentioned. It is in fact, the mo&s;t laughable piece which has been brought on the &s;tage for many years.&mdash;Mr. Colman was, or pretended to be of opinion, that this piece would be damned. A proof that managers are not always the be&s;t judges of the ta&s;te of the town; and one would think that they are not therefore the mo&s;t proper caterers, how|ever they may have a&s;&s;umed a right of cramming the public with any tra&s;h they think proper.</P>
<P>The fate of a writer for the &s;tage is not much to be envied. After many months labour to complete a piece to his own approbation, he is to &s;ummon patience to a bide all the manager's affected correc|tions, and &s;till more mortifying delays; and after all, perhaps, a di&s;gu&s;ted acquaintance &s;hall make a party, rai&s;e a riot, and damn the play!</P>
<P>Our ingenious writer had laid a plan for writing an <Q REND="inline">"Univer&s;al Dictionary of Arts and Sciences."</Q> In which he had a promi&s;e of the occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of Dr. John&s;on, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Mr. Beauclerc, and David Garrick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>&mdash;Of the &s;uc|ce&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="12">
of this great work, the Doctor had formed high expectations; but he did not live to make any pro|gre&s;s in it.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that our author cleared 1800 l. in one year by his writings; notwith&s;tanding which, part|ly by the unbounded benevolence of his di&s;po&s;ition, and partly from an unhappy turn for gaming, which he contracted in his latter years, he was often di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed for ca&s;h in a very great degree.</P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith's great and &s;hining talents procur|ed him many friends and admirers among per&s;ons in the fir&s;t walk of life; among others the Duke of Northumberland is mentioned, as having wi&s;hed to be known to our poet, who him&s;elf told the follow|ing &s;tory of his vi&s;it to the Peer.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I was invited, &s;aid the Doctor, by my friend Mr. Percy, to wait upon the Duke, in con&s;equence of the &s;atisfaction he had received from the peru&s;al of one of my productions. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in the be&s;t manner I could, and after &s;tudying &s;ome com|pliments I thought nece&s;&s;ary on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, proceeded to Northumberland-hou&s;e, and acquaint|ed the &s;ervants that I had particular bu&s;ine&s;s with his Grace. They &s;hewed me into an anti-chamber, where, after waiting &s;ome time, a gentleman very elegantly dre&s;&s;ed made his appearance. Taking him for the Duke, I delivered all the fine things I had compo&s;ed, in order to compliment him on the honour he had done me; when, to my great a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
<PB N="12" REF="13">
he told me I had mi&s;taken him for his ma&s;ter, who would &s;ee me immediately. At that in&s;tant the Duke came into the apartment; and I was &s;o con|fu&s;ed on the occa&s;ion, that I wanted words barely &s;ufficient to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e I entertained of the Duke's politene&s;s, and went away exceedingly cha|grined at the blunder I had committed."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith, happy as he thought him&s;elf in the &s;trength of a vigorous con&s;titution, paid at all times too little regard to the pre&s;ervation of that health &s;o dear to his friends, &s;o important to the public.</P>
<P>I remember, &s;ome years &s;ince, on the Doctor's partial recovery from a fit of illne&s;s, he came into the Chapter Coffee-Hou&s;e; when a gentleman ob|&s;erved how pale he looked, and expre&s;&s;ed his fears for his &s;afety:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Pale! (cried the poet, in a petti&s;h humour) that may be, Sir; but the <HI>Stamina's</HI> good&mdash;the <HI>Stamina's</HI> good."</Q></P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith's natural di&s;po&s;ition led him to covet a life of learned lei&s;ure; but this was too often interrupted by that want of money to which the benevolence of his di&s;po&s;ition frequently reduced him. When his circum&s;tances were embarra&s;&s;ed, his temper was &s;o ruffled, that he often expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t vehement manner. The&s;e gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, as they were very violent, were very &s;hort: the philo&s;opher recollected, and re&s;umed him&s;elf on a moment's reflection; but his &s;ervants
<PB N="13" REF="14">
profited by their ma&s;ter's violence; for they would put them&s;elves in his way, when he was in a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ure to reap the reward of unde&s;erved cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable of this gentleman, that, contrary to the opinion of almo&s;t all the world, he thought Ben John&s;on, Beaumont, and their co|temporaries, but &s;econd-rate poets; indeed he con&s;idered Shake&s;pear him&s;elf as inferior to Van|burgh and Farquhar.</P>
<P>The Doctor was, from principle, an enemy to that cla&s;s of patriotic writers, (as they are called) who di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, by abu&s;ing the govern|ment under which they live: in fact, he con&s;idered them as enemies to all good government. He was a friend to monarchy, and held &s;acred the per&s;on of the &s;overeign. But if he was an enemy to tho&s;e who abu&s;ed our government and governors, indi&s;cri|minately, he was much more &s;o to tho&s;e paltry, tho&s;e dete&s;table writers, who, &s;acrificing every con|&s;ideration at the &s;hrine of Plutus, wrote on both &s;ides of a conte&s;ted que&s;tion, and <HI>on both at the &s;ame time,</HI> for HIRE. It is &s;aid that Dr. Gold&s;mith did not &s;peak to Mr. Kelly for &s;even years pre|ceeding his death.</P>
<P>He firmly believed the doctrine of a future &s;tate, in which the mi&s;eries of the virtuous in this life, would be amply rewarded by a permanency of happine&s;s, incapable of decay: above flattering the vices or follies of the rich or great, he was ill qualified to pu&s;h his fortune among tho&s;e whom
<PB N="14" REF="15">
his genius taught to court his company: yet was he happy in a connection with many of the greate&s;t and be&s;t characters of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith being &s;eized with a violent indi&s;|po&s;ition, on the 25th of March, 1774, &s;ent for Mr. Hawes, an apothecary, in the Strand, the night &s;ucceeding that day, and declared his intention of taking Dr. James's fever powders; to his per&s;i&s;ting in which re&s;olution, many of his warme&s;t friends have a&s;cribed the lo&s;s of this great and good man! How far they are right in their conjectures it would be needle&s;s, if it were not impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay. Mr. Hawes has publi&s;hed an account of the Doctor's illne&s;s, &s;o far as relates to the exhibition of the&s;e powders. The public may be intere&s;ted in the enquiry into the probable effects of &s;o powerful a medicine. The writer of the&s;e pages has only to &s;ay, that Mr. Hawes is a man who&s;e &s;kill or vera|city will not be doubted for a moment by any one who has the honour of knowing him.</P>
<P>This delightful poet, this &s;weet morali&s;t, this excellent man! departed this life on the 4th of April, 1774, and was interred in the Burying-Ground of the Temple. It was propo&s;ed to have buried him in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abey, where, however, a monument is to be erected to his memory:&mdash;but the be&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting monument will be found in his works.</P>
<P>Dr. Gold&s;mith was in &s;tature rather under the middle &s;ize, and built more like the porter than
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the gentleman: his complexion was pale, his forehead low, his face almo&s;t round, and pitted with the &s;mall pox; but marked with the &s;trong lines of thinking: upon the whole there was no|thing in his appearance that would not rather pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind again&s;t him; but to tho&s;e who knew him, there appeared a melting &s;oftne&s;s in his eye, that was the genuine effect of his humanity. Never did that eye behold an object of di&s;tre&s;s, but it conveyed an intelligence to the heart, that &s;tretched out the hand irre&s;i&s;tibly to relieve; and it is well known that his unbounded philanthropy contributed to keep him poor; but he ever felt a &s;atisfaction in the con&s;cious dignity and liberality of his mind, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth without the will to di&s;tribute it could never have afforded!</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming that the be&s;t u&s;e to which biography can be applied is to profit by the amiable part of the author's character: I &s;hall extract, for the en|tertainment and in&s;truction of my readers, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages of Dr. Gold&s;mith's works, as mark in a &s;triking manner, the unbounded benevolence of his temper, or the elegant &s;implicity of his mind. That he thought ju&s;tly on mo&s;t occa&s;ions is a fact which will appear inconte&s;tible from the peru&s;al of many of the following ob&s;ervations:</P>
