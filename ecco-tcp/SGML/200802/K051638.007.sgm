<P>_I HAVE been under &s;uch concern for the poor man, who&s;e exit I almo&s;t hourly ex|pect, and at the &s;hocking &s;cenes his ill|ne&s;s, and his agonies exhibit; that I have been only able to make memoranda of the melancholy pa&s;&s;ages, from which to draw up a more perfect account, for the in&s;truction of us all, when the writing-appetite &s;hall return.</P>
<P>IT is returned! Indignation has revived it, on re|ceipt of thy letters of Sunday and ye&s;terday; by which I have rea&s;on to reproach thee in very &s;erious terms, that thou ha&s;t not kept thy honour with me: And if thy breach of it be attended with &s;uch effects as I fear it will be, I &s;hall let thee know more of my mind on this head.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3">If thou would'&s;t be thought in earne&s;t in thy wi&s;hes, to move the poor lady in thy favour, thy ludicrous behaviour at Smith's, when it comes to be repre&s;ented to her, will have a very <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> appearance; will it not?&mdash;It will, indeed, confirm her in her opinion, that the <HI>grave</HI> is more to be wi&s;hed-for, by one of her &s;erious and pious turn, than a <HI>husband</HI> incapable either of reflexion or re|mor&s;e; ju&s;t recovered, as thou art, from a dangerous, at lea&s;t a &s;harp illne&s;s.</P>
<P>I am extremely concerned for the poor unprotected lady; &s;he was &s;o exce&s;&s;ively low and weak on Saturday, that I could not be admitted to her &s;peech: And to be driven out of her lodgings, when it was fitter for her to be in bed, is &s;uch a piece of cruelty, as he only could be guilty of, who could act as thou ha&s;t done, by &s;uch an angel.</P>
<P>Can&s;t thou thy&s;elf &s;ay, on reflection, that it has not the look of a wicked and hardened &s;portivene&s;s, in thee, for the &s;ake of a wanton humour only, (&s;ince it can an&s;wer no end that thou propo&s;e&s;t to thy&s;elf, but the direct con|trary) to hunt from place to place a poor lady, who, like a harmle&s;s deer, that has already a barbed &s;haft in her brea&s;t, &s;eeks only a refuge from thee, in the &s;hades of death?</P>
<P>But I will leave this matter upon thy own con&s;cience, to paint thee &s;uch a &s;cene from my memoranda, as thou perhaps wilt be moved by more effectually than by any other: Becau&s;e it is &s;uch a one, as thou thy&s;elf mu&s;t one day be a principal actor in; and, as I thought, had&s;t very lately in apprehen&s;ion: And is the la&s;t &s;cene of one of thy mo&s;t intimate friends, who has been for the four pa&s;t days labouring in the agonies of death. For, Lovelace, let this truth, this undoubted truth, be ingraven on thy me|mory, in all thy gaieties, That the life we are &s;o fond of, is hardly life; a mere breathing-&s;pace only; and that at the end of its longe&s;t date,
<Q>THOU MUST DIE, AS WELL AS BELTON.</Q></P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t by Tourville what we had done as to the poor man's worldly affairs; and that we had got his unhappy &s;i&s;ter to come and live with him; (little did we think him
<PB N="3" REF="4">
&s;o very near his end); and &s;o I will proceed to tell thee, that when I arrived at his hou&s;e on Saturday night, I found him exce&s;&s;ively ill: But ju&s;t rai&s;ed, and in his elbow-chair, held up by his nur&s;e and Mowbray, (the roughe&s;t and mo&s;t untouched creature that ever enter'd a &s;ick man's chamber) while the maid-&s;ervants were trying to make that bed ea&s;ier for him which he was to return to; his mind ten times unea&s;ier than That could be, and the true cau&s;e that the down was no &s;ofter to him.</P>
<P>He had &s;o much longed to &s;ee me, his &s;i&s;ter told me, (whom I &s;ent for down to enquire how he was) that they all rejoiced when I entered: Here, &s;aid Mowbray, Here Tommy, is hone&s;t Jack Belford!</P>
<P>Where, where? &s;aid the poor man.</P>
<P>I hear his voice, cry'd Mowbray, coming up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>In a tran&s;port of joy, he would have rai&s;ed him&s;elf at my entrance, but had like to have pitched out of the chair: And when recover'd, call'd me his be&s;t friend! his <HI>kinde&s;t</HI> friend! but, bur&s;t out into a flood of tears, O Jack! O Belford! &s;aid he, &s;ee the way I am in! See how weak! So <HI>much,</HI> and &s;o &s;oon reduced! Do you know me? Do you know your poor friend Belton?</P>
<P>You are not &s;o much altered, my dear Belton, as you think you are. But I &s;ee you are weak; very weak&mdash;And I am &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>Weak! weak, indeed, my deare&s;t Belford, &s;aid he, and weaker in my mind, if po&s;&s;ible, than in my body; and wept bitterly&mdash;or I &s;hould not thus unman my&s;elf. I, who never feared <HI>any thing,</HI> to be forced to &s;hew my&s;elf &s;uch a <HI>nur&s;ling</HI>!&mdash;I am quite a&s;hamed of my&s;elf!&mdash;But don't de&s;pi&s;e me, dear Belford, don't de&s;pi&s;e me, I be&s;eech thee.</P>
<P>I ever honoured a man that could weep for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of <HI>others</HI>; and ever &s;hall, &s;aid I; and &s;uch a one cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to <HI>his own.</HI></P>
<P>However, I could not help being <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> moved at the poor fellow's emotion.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid the brutal Mowbray, do I think thee in&s;uf|ferable, Jack. Our poor friend is already a peg too low; and here thou art letting him down lower and lower &s;till. This &s;oothing of him in his dejected moments, and joining
<PB N="4" REF="5">
thy womani&s;h tears with his, is not the way; I am &s;ure it is not. If our Lovelace were here, he'd tell thee &s;o.</P>
<P>Thou art an impenetrable creature, reply'd I; unfit to be pre&s;ent at a &s;cene thou wilt not be able to feel the ter|rors of, till thou feele&s;t them in thy&s;elf; and then, if thou ha&s;t <HI>time for feeling,</HI> my life for thine, thou behave&s;t as pitifully, as tho&s;e thou thinke&s;t <HI>mo&s;t</HI> pitiful.</P>
<P>Then turning to the poor &s;ick man, Tears, my dear Belton, are no &s;igns of an <HI>unmanly,</HI> but, contrarily, of a humane nature; they ea&s;e the over-charged heart, which would bur&s;t but for that kindly and natural relief.</P>
<Q><L>Give Sorrow <HI>words,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Shake&s;peare;</HI>)</L>
<L>The grief that does not &s;peak,</L>
<L>Whi&s;pers the o'er-frought heart, and bids it break.</L></Q>
<P>I know, my dear Belton, thou u&s;ed&s;t to take plea&s;ure in repetitions from the poets; but thou mu&s;t be ta&s;te|le&s;s of their beauties now: Yet be not di&s;countenanced by this uncouth and unreflecting Mowbray, for as Juve|nal &s;ays, <HI>Tears are the prerogative of manhood.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis, at lea&s;t, &s;ea&s;onably &s;aid, my dear Belford; it is kind to keep me in countenance for this <HI>womani&s;h weak|ne&s;s,</HI> as Mowbray has been upbraidingly calling it, ever &s;ince he has been with me. And in &s;o doing (whatever I might have thought in &s;uch high health as he enjoys) has convinced me, that bottle-friends feel nothing but what moves in that little circle.</P>
<P>Well, well proceed in your own way, Jack. I love my friend Belton as well as you can do; yet for the blood of me, I cannot but think, that &s;oothing a man's weakne&s;s is increa&s;ing it.</P>
<P>If it be a weakne&s;s, to be touched at great and concern|ing events, in which our humanity is concerned, &s;aid I, thou maye&s;t be right.</P>
<P>I have &s;een many a man, &s;aid the rough creature, going up Holbourn-hill, that has behaved more like a man than either of you.</P>
<P>Ay, but Mowbray, reply'd the poor man, tho&s;e wretches have not had &s;uch infirmities of body as I have long la|boured under, to enervate their minds. Thou art a &s;hock|ing
<PB N="5" REF="6">
fellow, and ever wert. But to be able to remember nothing in the&s;e moments, but what reproaches me, and to know, that I cannot hold it long, and what may <HI>then</HI> be my lot, if&mdash;But interrupting him&s;elf and turning to me, Give me thy pity, Jack, 'tis balm to my wounded &s;oul; and let Mowbray &s;it indifferent enough to the pangs of a dying friend, to laugh at us both.</P>
<P>The harden'd fellow then retired, with the air of a Lovelace; only more &s;tupid; yawning and &s;tretching, in&s;tead of humming a tune as thou did&s;t at Smith's.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;i&s;ted to get the poor man into bed. He was &s;o weak and low, that he could not bear the fatigue, and fainted away; and I verily thought was quite gone. But recovering, and his doctor coming, and advi&s;ing to keep him quiet, I retired, and joined Mowbray in the garden; who took more delight to talk of the living Lovelace and his levities, than of the dying Belton and his repen|tance.</P>
<P>I ju&s;t &s;aw him again on Saturday night before I went to bed: which I did early; for I was &s;urfeited with Mow|bray's frothy in&s;en&s;ibility, and could not bear him. It is &s;uch a horrid thing to think of, that a man who had lived in &s;uch &s;trict terms of <HI>amity</HI> with another (the proof does not come out &s;o, as to &s;ay <HI>friend&s;hip</HI>); who had pretended &s;o much love for him; could not bear to be out of his com|pany; would ride a hundred miles an end to enjoy it, and would fight for him, be the cau&s;e right or wrong: Yet now, could be &s;o little moved to &s;ee him in &s;uch mi&s;ery of body and mind as to be able to rebuke him, and rather ridicule than pity him, becau&s;e he was more affected by what he felt, than he had &s;een a malefactor (hardened perhaps by liquor, and not &s;oftened by pre|vious &s;ickne&s;s) on his going to execution.</P>
<P>This put me &s;trongly in mind of what the divine Mi&s;s HARLOWE once &s;aid to me, talking of friend&s;hip, and what my friend&s;hip to <HI>you</HI> required of me:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Depend up|on it, Mr. Belford,' &s;aid &s;he,
that one day you will be convinced, that what <HI>you</HI> call friend&s;hip, is chaff and &s;tubble; and that nothing is worthy of that &s;acred name,
<Q>'THAT HAS NOT VIRTUE FOR ITS BASE'</Q></Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">Sunday morning, I was called up at &s;ix o' clock, at his earne&s;t reque&s;t, and found him in a terrible agony. O Jack! Jack! &s;aid he, looking wildly, as if he had &s;een a &s;pectre&mdash;Come nearer me! reaching out both arms.&mdash;Come nearer me!&mdash;Dear, dear Belford, &s;ave me! Then cla&s;ping my arm with both his hands, and rearing up his head towards me, his eyes &s;trangely rolling, Save me! dear Belford, &s;ave me! repeated he.</P>
<P>I put my other arm about him,&mdash;Save you from what, my dear Belton! Save you from what!&mdash;Nothing &s;hall hurt you!&mdash;What mu&s;t I &s;ave you from?</P>
<P>Recovering from his terror, he &s;unk down again, O &s;ave me from my&s;elf! &s;aid he; Save me from my own re|flections. O dear Jack! what a thing it is to die; and not to have one comfortable reflection to revolve!&mdash;What would I give for one year of my pa&s;&s;ed life?&mdash;only <HI>one</HI> year&mdash;and to have the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of things that I now have?</P>
<P>I try'd to comfort him, as well as I could: But free-livers to free-livers are &s;orry death-bed comforters. And he broke in upon me: O my dear Belford, &s;aid he, I am told, (and I have heard you ridiculed for it) that the ex|cellent Mi&s;s Harlowe has wrought a conver&s;ion in you. May it be &s;o! you are a man of &s;en&s;e; O may it be &s;o! Now is your time! Now, that you are in full vigour of mind and body! But your poor Belton, alas! kept his vices, till they left him. And &s;ee the mi&s;erable effects in debility of mind and de&s;pondency! Were Mowbray here, and were he to <HI>laugh</HI> at me, I would own that this is the cau&s;e of my de&s;pair: That God's <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> cannot let his <HI>mercy</HI> operate for my comfort: For Oh! I have been very, <HI>very</HI> wicked; and have de&s;pi&s;ed the offers of his grace, till he has withdrawn it from me for ever.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed all the arguments I could think of, to give him con&s;olation; and what I &s;aid, had &s;uch an effect upon him, as to quiet his mind for the greate&s;t part of the day; and in a lucid hour his memory &s;erved him to repeat tho&s;e lines of Dryden, gra&s;ping my hand, and looking wi&s;tfully upon me:
<Q><PB N="7" REF="8">
<L>O that I le&s;s could fear to lo&s;e this being,</L>
<L>Which, like a &s;now-ball, in my coward-band,</L>
<L>The more 'tis gra&s;p'd, the fa&s;ter melts away!</L></Q></P>
<P>In the afternoon of Sunday, he was inqui&s;itive after you, and your pre&s;ent behaviour to Mi&s;s Harlowe. I told him how you had been, and how light you made of it. Mowbray was plea&s;ed with your impenetrable hardne&s;s of heart, and &s;aid, Bob Lovelace was a good edge-tool, and &s;teel to the back: And &s;uch coar&s;e but hearty prai&s;es he gave thee, as an abandon'd man might <HI>give,</HI> and only an abandon'd man could wi&s;h to <HI>de&s;erve.</HI></P>
<P>But had&s;t thou heard what the poor dying, wi&s;e-too-late Belton &s;aid on this occa&s;ion, perhaps it would have made thee &s;erious an <HI>hour or two,</HI> at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>When poor Lovelace is brought, &s;aid he, to a &s;ick-bed, as I am now, and his mind forebodes, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould recover, which <HI>his</HI> could not do in his late illne&s;s: If it had, he could not have behaved &s;o lightly in it&mdash;When he revolves his pa&s;t mi&s;-&s;pent life; his actions of offence to helple&s;s innocents; in Mi&s;s Harlowe's ca&s;e particularly: What then, will he think of him&s;elf, or of his pa&s;t actions? His mind debilitated; his &s;trength turned into weakne&s;s; unable to &s;tir or to move without help; not one ray of hope darting in upon his benighted &s;oul; his con&s;cience &s;tanding in the place of a thou&s;and wit|ne&s;&s;es; his pains excruciating; weary of the poor rem|nant of life he drags, yet dreading that in a few &s;hort hours, his bed will be changed to wor&s;e, nay, to wor&s;t of all; and that wor&s;t of all, to la&s;t beyond time and to all eter|nity; O Jack! What will he then think of the poor tran|&s;itory gratifications of &s;en&s;e, which now engage all his attention? Tell him, dear Belford, tell him, how happy he is, if he knows his own happine&s;s; how happy, com|pared to his poor dying friend, that he has recovered from his illne&s;s, and has &s;till an opportunity lent him, for which I would give a thou&s;and worlds, had I them to give!</P>
<P>I approved exceedingly of what he &s;aid, as reflections &s;uited to his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; and inferred con&s;o|lations to him from a mind &s;o properly touched.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">He proceeded in the like penitent &s;train. I have lived a very wicked life; &s;o have we all. We have never made a con&s;cience of doing all the mi&s;chief, that either force or fraud put it in our power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o do. We have laid &s;nares for the innocent heart; and have not &s;crupled by the too-ready &s;word to extend, as occa&s;ions offer'd, the wrongs we did, to the per&s;ons whom we had before injur'd in their deare&s;t relations. But yet I think in my heart, that I have le&s;s to an&s;wer for than either Lovelace or Mow|bray; for I, by taking to my&s;elf that accur&s;ed deceiver from whom thou ha&s;t freed me, (and who for years, un|known to me, was retaliating upon my own head &s;ome of the evils I had brought upon others) and retiring, and living with her as a wife, was not party to half the mi&s;|chiefs, that I doubt they, and Tourville, and even You, Belford, committed. As to the ungrateful Thoma&s;m, I hope I have met with my puni&s;hment in her. But not|with&s;tanding this, do&s;t thou not think, that <HI>&s;uch</HI> an action&mdash;and <HI>&s;uch</HI> an action&mdash;and <HI>&s;uch</HI> an action, (and then he re|capitulated &s;everal enormities, in which, led on by fal&s;e bravery, and the heat of youth and wine, we have all been concerned) Do&s;t thou not think that the&s;e villainies, (let me call them <HI>now</HI> by their proper name,) joined to the wilful and gloried-in neglect of every duty that our better &s;en&s;e and education gave us to know were required of us as Men and Chri&s;tians, are not enough to weigh down my &s;oul into de&s;pondency?&mdash;Indeed, indeed, they are! And now to hope for <HI>mercy!</HI> And to depend upon the efficacy of that gracious attribute when that no le&s;s &s;hining one of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> forbids me to hope; How can I!&mdash;I, who have de&s;pi&s;ed all warnings, and taken no advantage of the benefit I might have reap'd from the lingring con&s;umptive illne&s;s I have laboured under, but left all to the la&s;t &s;take; hoping for recovery, again&s;t hope, and driving off re|pentance, till that grace is denyed me; for oh! my dear Belford! I can now neither repent, nor pray, as I ought; my heart is harden'd, and I can do nothing but de&s;pair!&mdash;</P>
<P>More he would have &s;aid; but, overwhelm'd with grief and infirmity, he bowed his head upon his pangful
<PB N="9" REF="10">
bo&s;om, endeavouring to hide from the &s;ight of the har|dened Mowbray, who ju&s;t then enter'd the room, tho&s;e tears which he could not re&s;train.</P>
<P>Prefac'd by a phlegmatic hem; Sad, very &s;ad, truly! cry'd Mowbray; who &s;at him&s;elf down on one &s;ide of the bed, as I on the other: His eyes half clo&s;ed, and his lips pouting out to his turn'd-up no&s;e, his chin curdled (to u&s;e one of thy de&s;criptions) leaving one at a lo&s;s to know, whether &s;tupid drow&s;ine&s;s or inten&s;e contempla|tion had got mo&s;t hold of him.</P>
<P>An excellent, however unea&s;y le&s;&s;on, Mowbray, &s;aid I! by my faith it is!&mdash;It may one day, who knows how &s;oon? be our own ca&s;e!</P>
<P>I thought of thy yawning fit, as de&s;cribed in thy letter of Aug. 13. For up &s;tarted Mowbray, writhing and &s;hak|ing him&s;elf as in an ague-fit; his hands &s;tretch'd over his head&mdash;with thy hoy! hoy! hoy! yawning.&mdash;And then re|covering him&s;elf, with another &s;tretch and a &s;hake, What's a clock, cried he? pulling out his watch&mdash;And &s;talking by long tip-toe &s;trides thro' the room, down &s;tairs he went; and meeting the maid, in the pa&s;&s;age, I heard him &s;ay&mdash;Betty, bring me a bumper of claret; thy poor ma&s;ter, and this damn'd Belford are enough to throw a Hercules into the vapours.</P>
<P>Mowbray, after this, amu&s;ing him&s;elf in our friend's library, which is, as thou knowe&s;t, chiefly cla&s;&s;ical and dramatical, found out a pa&s;&s;age in Lee's Oedipus, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould needs have to be extremely apt, and in he came full fraught with the notion of the courage it would give the dying man, and read it to him. 'Tis poetical and pretty. This is it.</P>
<Q><L>When the <HI>&s;un &s;ets,</HI> &s;hadows that &s;hew'd at <HI>noon</HI></L>
<L>But &s;mall, appear mo&s;t long and terrible:</L>
<L>So when we think fate hovers o'er our heads,</L>
<L>Our apprehen&s;ions &s;hoot beyond all bounds:</L>
<L>Owls, ravens, crickets &s;eem the watch of death:</L>
<L>Nature's wor&s;t verman &s;care her god-like &s;ons.</L>
<L>Echoes, the very leavings of a voice,</L>
<L>Grow babling gho&s;ts, and call us to our graves.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11">Each mole-hill thought &s;wells to a huge Olympus;</L>
<L>While we, fanta&s;tic dreamers, heave and puff,</L>
<L>And &s;weat with our imagination's weight.</L></Q>
<P>He expected prai&s;es for finding this out. But Belton turning his head from him, Ah, Dick! (&s;aid he) the&s;e are not the reflections of a dying man! What thou wilt one day feel, if it be what I now feel, will convince thee that the evils <HI>before</HI> thee, and <HI>with</HI> thee, are more than the effects of imagination.</P>
<P>I was called twice on Sunday-night to him; for the poor fellow, when his reflections on his pa&s;t life annoy him mo&s;t, is afraid of being left with the women; and his eyes, they tell me, hunt and roll about for me. Where's Mr. Belford?&mdash;But I &s;hall tire him out, cries he&mdash;yet beg of him to &s;tep to me&mdash;yet don't&mdash;yet do; were once the doubting and changeful orders he gave: And they called me accordingly.</P>
<P>But, alas! What could Belford do for him? Belford, who had been but too often the companion of his guilty hours, who wants mercy as much as he does; and is un|able to promi&s;e it to him&s;elf, tho' 'tis all he can bid his poor friend <HI>rely</HI> upon!</P>
<P>What mi&s;creants are we! What figures &s;hall we make in the&s;e terrible hours!</P>
<P>If Mi&s;s HARLOWE's glorious <HI>Example,</HI> on one hand, and the <HI>terrors of This</HI> poor man's on the other, affect me not, I mu&s;t be abandoned to perdition; as I fear thou wilt be, if thou benefitte&s;t not thy&s;elf from both.</P>
<P>Among the con&s;olatory things I urged, when I was called up the la&s;t time on Sunday-night, I told him, That he mu&s;t not ab&s;olutely give him&s;elf up to de&s;pair: That many of the apprehen&s;ions he was under, were &s;uch as the be&s;t men mu&s;t have, on the dreadful uncertainty of what was to &s;ucceed to this life. 'Tis well ob&s;erved, &s;aid I, by a poetical divine, who was an excellent chri&s;tian, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Norris</HI> of <HI>Bemerton.</HI></NOTE> That
<Q><L>Death could not a more &s;ad retinue find,</L>

<P><PB N="11" REF="12">About eight o'clock ye&s;terday (Monday) morning, I found him a little calmer. He a&s;ked me, who was the author of the two lines I had repeated to him; and made me &s;peak them over again. A <HI>&s;ad retinue,</HI> indeed, &s;aid the poor man! And then expre&s;&s;ing his hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of life, and his terrors at the thoughts of dying; and draw|ing from thence terrible conclu&s;ions with regard to his future &s;tate, There is, &s;aid I, &s;uch a <HI>natural</HI> aver&s;ion to death in human nature, that you are not to imagine, that you, my dear Belton, are &s;ingular in the fear of it, and in the apprehen&s;ions that fill the thoughtful mind upon its approach; but you ought, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;eparate tho&s;e <HI>natural</HI> fears, which all men mu&s;t have on &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion, from tho&s;e <HI>particular</HI> ones, which your ju&s;tly-apprehended unfitne&s;s fills you with. Lord Ro&s;common, in his <HI>Pro&s;pect of Death,</HI> which I dipped into la&s;t night from a collection in your clo&s;et, and which I put into my pocket, &s;ays, (and turning to the place)
<Q><L>Merely to die, no man of rea&s;on fears;</L>
<L>For certainly we mu&s;t,</L>
<L>As we are born, return to du&s;t;</L>
<L>'Tis the la&s;t point of many ling'ring years:</L>
<L>But whither then we go,</L>
<L>Whither we fain would know;</L>
<L>But human under&s;tanding cannot &s;hew.</L>
<L>This makes us tremble&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>My Lord Ro&s;common, therefore, proceeded I, had &s;uch apprehen&s;ions of this dark &s;tate as you have: And the ex|cellent divine I hinted at la&s;t night, who had very little el&s;e but human frailties to reproach him&s;elf with, and who&s;e Mi&s;cellanies fell into my hands among my uncle's books, in my attendance upon him in his la&s;t hours, &s;ays,
<Q><L>It mu&s;t be done, my &s;oul: But 'tis a &s;trange,</L>
<L>A di&s;mal and my&s;terious change,</L>
<L>When thou &s;halt leave this tenement of clay,</L>
<L>And to an unknown&mdash;&s;omewhere&mdash;wing away;</L>
<L>When Time &s;hall be Eternity, and thou</L>
<L>Shalt be&mdash;thou knowe&s;t not what&mdash;and live&mdash;thou know'&s;t not how!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13">Amazing &s;tate! no wonder that we dread</L>
<L>To think of death, or view the dead;</L>
<L>Thou're all wrapt up in clouds, as if to thee</L>
<L>Our very knowlege had antipathy.</L></Q>
Then follows, what I repeated,
<Q><L>Death could not a more &s;ad retinue find,</L>
<L>Sickne&s;s and pain before, and darkne&s;s all behind.</L></Q></P>
<P>Alas! my dear Belford, (inferr'd the unhappy deep-thinker) what poor creatures does this convince me we mor|tals are at be&s;t!&mdash;But what then mu&s;t be the ca&s;e of &s;uch a profligate as I, who, by a pa&s;t wicked life, have added force to the&s;e natural terrors? If death be &s;o repugnant a thing to human nature, that <HI>good</HI> men will be &s;tartled at it, what mu&s;t it be to one who has lived a life of &s;en&s;e and ap|petite; nor ever reflected upon the end which I now am within view of?</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay to an inference &s;o fairly drawn? Mercy! mercy! <HI>unbounded mercy!</HI> was &s;till my plea, tho' his repeated oppo&s;ition of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> to it, in a manner &s;ilenced it: And what would I have given to have had ri&s;e to my mind, one good, one eminently good action, to have re|membered him of, in order to combat his fears with it?</P>
<P>I believe, Lovelace, I &s;hall tire thee, and that more with the &s;ubject of my letter, than even with the length of it. But, really, I think thy &s;pirits are &s;o offen&s;ively up, &s;ince thy recovery, that I ought, as the melancholy &s;ubjects offer, to endeavour by them to reduce thee to the &s;tandard of humanity. And then thou can&s;t not but be curious to know every thing that concerns the poor man, for whom thou ha&s;t always expre&s;&s;ed a great re|gard. I will therefore proceed as I have begun: If thou like&s;t not to read it now, lay it by, if thou wilt, till the like circum&s;tances befal thee, till like reflections from tho&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eize thee; and then take it up, and compare the two ca&s;es together.</P>
<P>AT his earne&s;t reque&s;t, I &s;at up with him la&s;t night; and, poor man! it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell thee, how ea&s;y and &s;afe he thought him&s;elf in my company, for the fir&s;t part of the night: <HI>A drowning man will catch at a &s;traw,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the Proverb well &s;ays: And a &s;traw was I, with re&s;pect to any real help I could give him. He often awaked in terrors, and once calling out for me, Dear Belford, &s;aid he, Where are you!&mdash;Oh! There you are!&mdash;Give me your friendly hand!&mdash;Then gra&s;ping it, and putting his clam|my, half-cold lips to it&mdash;How kind! I fear every thing when you are ab&s;ent! But the pre&s;ence of a friend, a &s;ympathizing friend&mdash;Oh! how comfortable!&mdash;</P>
<P>But about four in the morning, he frighted me much: He waked with three terrible groans; and endeavoured to &s;peak, but could not pre&s;ently&mdash;and when he did,&mdash;Jack, Jack, Jack, five or &s;ix times repeated he as quick as thought, now, now, now, &s;ave me, &s;ave me, &s;ave me&mdash;I am going,&mdash;going indeed!</P>
<P>I threw my arms about him, and rai&s;ed him upon his pillow, as he was &s;inking (as if to hide him&s;elf) in the bed-cloaths&mdash;And &s;taring wildly, Where am I! &s;aid he, a little recovering. Did you not &s;ee him! turning his head this way and that; horror in his countenance; Did you not &s;ee him?</P>
<P>See who! See what, my dear Belton!</P>
<P>O lay me upon the bed again, cry'd he!&mdash;Let me not die upon the floor! Lay me down gently! And &s;tand by me! Leave me not! All, all will &s;oon be over!</P>
<P>You are already, my dear Belton, upon the bed. You have not been upon the floor.&mdash;This is a &s;trong deli|rium; you are faint for want of refre&s;hment; (for he had refu&s;ed &s;everal times to take any thing) Let me per|&s;uade you to take &s;ome of this cordial julep. I will leave you, if you will not oblige me.</P>
<P>He then readily took it; but &s;aid he could have &s;worn that Tom Metcalfe had been in the room, and had drawn him out of bed by the throat, upbraiding him with the injuries he had fir&s;t done his &s;i&s;ter, and then him, in the duel to which he owed that fever which co&s;t him his life.</P>
<P>Thou knowe&s;t the &s;tory, Lovelace, too well, to need my repeating it: But mercy on us, if in the&s;e terrible mo|ments all the evils we do, ri&s;e to our affrighted imagi|nations! If &s;o, what &s;hocking &s;cenes have I, but &s;till more ha&s;t thou, to go through, if, as the noble poet &s;ays,
<Q>If, any &s;en&s;e at that &s;ad time remains.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15">The doctor ordered him an opiate, this morning early, which operated &s;o well, that he do&s;ed and &s;lept &s;everal hours more quietly than he had done for the two pa&s;t days and nights, tho' he had &s;leeping draughts given him before. But it is more and more evident every hour, that nature is almo&s;t worn out in him.</P>
<P>MOWBRAY, quite tired with this hou&s;e of mourning, intends to &s;et out in the morning to find you. He was not a little rejoiced to hear you were in town; I believe to have a pretence to leave us.</P>
<P>He has ju&s;t taken leave of his poor friend, intending to go away early: An everla&s;ting leave, I may venture to &s;ay; for I think he will hardly live till to-morrow night.</P>
<P>I believe the poor man would not have been &s;orry had he left him when I arrived; for 'tis a &s;hocking crea|ture, and enjoys too &s;trong health to know how to pity the &s;ick. Then (to borrow an ob&s;ervation from thee) he has, by nature, &s;trong bodily organs, which tho&s;e of his &s;oul are not likely to whet out; and he, as well as the wicked friend he is going to, may la&s;t a great while from the &s;trength of their con&s;titutions, tho' &s;o greatly different in their talents; if neither the &s;word nor the halter inter|po&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t repeat, That I cannot but be very unea&s;y for the poor lady, whom thou &s;o cruelly per&s;ecute&s;t; and that I do not think thou ha&s;t kept thy honour with me. I was apprehen&s;ive, indeed, that thou would&s;t attempt to &s;ee her, as &s;oon as thou gotte&s;t well enough to come up; and I told her as much, making u&s;e of it as an argument to prepare her for thy vi&s;it, and to induce her to &s;tand it. But &s;he could not, it is plain, bear the &s;hock of it; and, indeed, &s;he told me, that &s;he would not &s;ee thee, tho' but for one half hour, for the world.</P>
<P>Could &s;he have prevailed upon her&s;elf, I know that the &s;ight of her would have been as affecting to thee, as thy vi&s;it could have been to her; when thou had&s;t &s;een to what a lovely &s;keleton (for &s;he is really lovely &s;till, nor can &s;he, with &s;uch a form and features, be other|wi&s;e) thou ha&s;t, in a few weeks, reduced one of the mo&s;t

charming women in the world; and that in the full bloom of her youth and beauty.</P>
<P>Mowbray undertakes to carry This, that he may be more welcome to you, he &s;ays. Were it to be &s;ent un|&s;ealed, the characters we write in would be Hebrew to the dunce. I de&s;ire you to return it; and I'll give you a copy of it upon demand; for I intend to keep it by me, as a guard again&s;t the infection of thy company which might otherwi&s;e, perhaps, &s;ome time hence, be apt to weaken the impre&s;&s;ions I always de&s;ire to have of the awful &s;cene before me.

<P>I BELIEVE no man has two &s;uch &s;ervants as I have. Becau&s;e I treat them with kindne&s;s, and do not lord it over my inferiors, and damn and cur&s;e them by looks and words like Mowbray; or beat their teeth out like Lovelace; but cry, Pr'ythee, Harry, do this, and Pr'ythee, Jonathan, do that, the fellows pur&s;ue their own devices, and regard nothing I &s;ay, but what falls in with the&s;e. Here, this vile Harry, who might have brought your letter of ye&s;terday in good time, came not in with it till pa&s;t eleven la&s;t night (drunk, I &s;uppo&s;e); and concluding that I was in bed, as he pretends, (becau&s;e he was told I &s;at up the preceding night) brought it not to me; and having over &s;lept him&s;elf, ju&s;t as I had &s;ealed up my letter, in comes the villain with the forgotten one, &s;haking his ears, and looking as if he him&s;elf did not believe the ex|cu&s;es he was going to make. I que&s;tioned him about it, and heard his pitiful pleas, and tho' I never think it be|comes a gentleman to treat people in&s;olently who by their &s;tations are humbled beneath his feet, yet could I not forbear to <HI>Lovelace</HI> and <HI>Mowbray</HI>-him, mo&s;t cordially.</P>
<P>And this detaining Mowbray, (who was ready to &s;et out to thee before) while I write a few lines upon it, the fierce fellow, who is impatient to exchange the company of a dying Belton, for that of a too lively Lovelace, affixed a <HI>&s;upplement</HI> of cur&s;es upon the &s;taring fellow that
<PB N="16" REF="17">
was larger than my <HI>book</HI>&mdash;Nor did I offer to take off the Bear from &s;uch a Mongrel, &s;ince he de&s;erved not of me, on this occa&s;ion, the protection which every ma&s;ter owes to a good &s;ervant.</P>
<P>He has not done cur&s;ing him yet; for &s;talking about the court-yard with his boots on, (the poor fellow dre&s;&s;ing his hor&s;e, and unable to get from him) he is at him with|out mercy; and I will heighten his impatience (&s;ince be|ing ju&s;t under the window where I am writing, he will not let me attend to my pen) by telling thee, how he fills my ears as well as the fellow's, with his&mdash;Hay, Sir! And G&mdash;d d&mdash;n ye, Sir! And were you my &s;ervant, ye dog ye! And mu&s;t I &s;tay here till the mid-day &s;un &s;corches me to a parchment, for &s;uch a mangey dog's drunken neglect?&mdash;Ye lye, Sirrah! Ye lye, I tell you&mdash;(I hear the fellow's voice in an humble excu&s;atory tone, tho' not articulately) Ye lye, ye dog!&mdash;I'd a good mind to thru&s;t my whip down your drunken throat: Damn me, if I would not flay the &s;kin from the back of &s;uch a ra&s;cal, if thou wert mine, and have dog's-&s;kin gloves made of it, for thy brother &s;coundrels to wear in remembrance of thy abu&s;es of &s;uch a ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The poor hor&s;e &s;uffers for this, I doubt not; for, What now! and, Stand &s;till, and be damn'd to ye, cries the fellow, with a kick, I &s;uppo&s;e, which he better de&s;erves him&s;elf. For the&s;e varlets, where they can, are Mow|brays and Lovelaces to man or bea&s;t; and, not daring to an&s;wer <HI>him,</HI> is flaying the poor <HI>hor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I hear the fellow is ju&s;t e&s;caped, the hor&s;e (better curryed than ordinary, I &s;uppo&s;e, in half the u&s;ual time) by his clanking &s;hoes, and Mowbray's &s;ilence, letting me know, that I may now write on: And &s;o, I will tell thee, that, in the fir&s;t place, (little as I, as well as you, regard dreams,) I would have thee lay thine to heart; for I could give thee &s;uch an interpretation of it, as would &s;hock thee, perhaps: and if thou a&s;keth me for it, I will.</P>
<P>Mowbray calls to me from the court-yard, That 'tis a cur&s;ed hot day, and he &s;hall be fry'd by riding in the noon of it: And, that poor Belton longs to &s;ee me. So I will only add, my earne&s;t de&s;ire, that thou wilt give over all
<PB N="17" REF="18">
thoughts of &s;eeing the lady, if, when this comes to thy hand, thou ha&s;t not &s;een her: And, that it would be kind, if thoud'&s;t come, and, for the la&s;t time thou wilt ever &s;ee thy poor friend, &s;hare my concern <HI>for</HI> him; and, <HI>in</HI> him, &s;ee what, in a little time, will be thy fate and mine, and That of Mowbray, Tourville, and the re&s;t of us:&mdash;For what are ten, fifteen, twenty, or thirty years, to look back to: In which period forward we &s;hall all, perhaps, be mingled with the du&s;t we &s;prung from?</P>

<P>I HAVE good news to tell you. I am &s;etting out with all diligence for my father's hou&s;e. I am bid to hope that he will receive his poor penitent with a goodne&s;s pe|culiar to him&s;elf; for I am overjoyed with the a&s;&s;urance of a thorough reconciliation, thro' the interpo&s;ition of a dear ble&s;&s;ed friend, whom I always loved and honoured.
<PB N="18" REF="19">
I am &s;o taken up with my preparation for this joyful and long-wi&s;hed-for journey, that I cannot &s;pare one mo|ment for any other bu&s;ine&s;s, having &s;everal matters of the la&s;t importance to &s;ettle fir&s;t.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I di&s;patched in&s;tantly a letter to the dear creature, a&s;&s;uring her, with the mo&s;t thankful joy,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I would directly &s;et out for Berks, and wait the i&s;&s;ue of the happy reconci|liation, and the charming hopes &s;he had filled me with. I poured out upon her a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings. I declared, that it &s;hould be the &s;tudy of my whole life to merit &s;uch tran&s;cendent goodne&s;s. And that there was no|thing which her father or friends &s;hould require at my hands, that I would not for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake comply with, in order to promote and complete &s;o de&s;irable a recon|ciliation."</Q></P>
<P>I hurried it away, without taking a copy of it; and I have ordered the chariot-and-&s;ix to be got ready; and, hey for M. Hall!&mdash;Let me but know how Belton does. I hope a letter from thee is on the road. And if the poor fellow can &s;pare thee, make ha&s;te, I advi&s;e thee, to at|tend this truly divine lady, or el&s;e thou maye&s;t not &s;ee her of months perhaps; at lea&s;t, not while &s;he is Mi&s;s HARLOWE. And favour me with one letter before &s;he &s;ets out; if po&s;&s;ible, confirming to me, and accounting for, this generous change.</P>
<P>But what accounting for it is nece&s;&s;ary? The dear crea|ture cannot receive con&s;olation her&s;elf, but &s;he mu&s;t com|municate it to others. How noble!&mdash;She would not &s;ee me in her adver&s;ity: But no &s;ooner does the &s;un of pro|&s;perity begin to &s;hine upon her, than &s;he forgives me.</P>
<P>I know to who&s;e mediation all this is owing. It is to Col. Morden's. She always, as &s;he &s;ays, lov'd and ho|nour'd him: And he loved her above all his relations.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now be convinced that there is &s;omething in
<PB N="19" REF="20">
dreams. The ceiling opening is the reconciliation in view. The bright form, lifting her up through it to an|other ceiling &s;tuck round with golden Cherubims and Sera|phims, indicates the charming little boys and girls, that will be the fruits of this happy reconciliation. The welcomes, thrice repeated, are tho&s;e of her family, now no more to be deemed implacable. Yet are they a family too, that my &s;oul cannot mingle with.</P>
<P>But then what is my tumbling over and over, thro' the floor, into a frightful hole (<HI>de&s;cending</HI> as &s;he <HI>a&s;cends</HI>)? Ho! only This; it alludes to my di&s;reli&s;h to matrimony: Which is a bottomle&s;s pit, a gulph, and I know not what. And I &s;uppo&s;e, had I not awoke (in &s;uch a plaguy fright) I had been &s;ou&s;ed into &s;ome river at the bottom of the hole, and then been carried (mundified or purified from my pa&s;t ini|quities) by the &s;ame bright form (waiting for me upon the mo&s;&s;y banks) to my beloved girl; and we &s;hould have gone on, cherubiming of it, and carolling, to the end of the chapter.</P>
<P>But what are the black &s;weeping mantles and robes of my Lord M. thrown over my face, and what are tho&s;e of the Ladies? Oh, Jack! I have the&s;e too: They indicate no|thing in the world but that my Lord will be &s;o good as to die, and leave me all he has. So, re&s;t to thy good na|tured &s;oul, hone&s;t Lord M.</P>
<P>Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance, will al&s;o die, and leave me &s;windging legacies.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Charlotte and her &s;i&s;ter&mdash;what will become of them?&mdash;O! they will be in mourning of cour&s;e for their uncle and aunts&mdash;That's right!</P>
<P>As to Morden's fla&s;hing through the window, and cry|ing, Die, Lovelace, and be damn'd, if thou wilt not re|pair my cou&s;in's wrongs! That is only, that he would have &s;ent me a challenge, had I not been di&s;po&s;ed to do the lady ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>All I di&s;like is This part of the dream: For, even in a dream, I would not be thought to be threatened into any mea&s;ure, tho' I liked it ever &s;o well.</P>
<P>And &s;o much for my prophetic dream.</P>
<P>Dear charming creature! What a meeting will there be between her and her father and mother and uncles! What
<PB N="20" REF="21">
tran&s;ports, what plea&s;ure, will this happy, long-wi&s;hed for reconciliation give her dutiful heart! And indeed, now, methinks, I am glad &s;he <HI>is</HI> &s;o dutiful to them; for her duty to parents is a conviction to me, that &s;he will be <HI>as</HI> dutiful to her hu&s;band: Since duty upon principle is an uniform thing.</P>
<P>Why pr'ythee, now, Jack, I have not been &s;o much to blame, as thou thinke&s;t: For had it not been for me, who have led her into &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he could neither have <HI>received</HI> nor <HI>given</HI> the joy that will now overwhelm them all. So here ri&s;es great and durable good out of temporary evil!</P>
<P>I knew they loved her, (the pride and glory of their fa|mily) too well to hold out long!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could have &s;een Arabella's letter. She has al|ways been &s;o much eclip&s;ed by her &s;i&s;ter, that, I dare &s;ay, &s;he has &s;ignified this reconciliation to her with intermingled phlegm and wormwood; and her invitation mo&s;t cer|tainly runs all in the rock-water &s;tyle.</P>
<P>I &s;hall long to &s;ee the promi&s;ed letter too, when &s;he is got thither, which I hope will give an account of the recep|tion &s;he will meet with.</P>
<P>There is a &s;olemnity, however, I think, in the &s;tyle of her letter, which plea&s;es and affects me at the &s;ame time. But as it is evident &s;he loves me &s;till, and hopes &s;oon to &s;ee me at her father's; &s;he could not help being a little &s;olemn, and half-a&s;hamed, (dear blu&s;hing pretty rogue!) to own her love, after my u&s;age of her.</P>
<P>And then her &s;ub&s;cription: <HI>Till when, I am,</HI> CLARISSA HARLOWE: As much as to &s;ay, <HI>after that,</HI> I &s;hall be, if not <HI>your own fault,</HI> CLARISSA LOVELACE!</P>
<P>O my be&s;t love! My ever generous and adorable crea|ture! How much does this thy forgiving goodne&s;s exalt us both!&mdash;I, for the occa&s;ion given thee! Thou for turn|ing it &s;o gloriou&s;ly to thy advantage, and to the honour of both!</P>
<P>And if, my beloved creature, you will but connive at the imperfections of your adorer, and not play the <HI>wife</HI> upon me: If, while the charms of Novelty have their force with me, I &s;hould happen to be drawn a&s;ide by the intricacies of intrigue, and of plots that my &s;oul loves to

form, and pur&s;ue; and if thou wilt not be open-eyed to the follies of my youth, (a tran&s;itory &s;tate!) every excur|&s;ion &s;hall &s;erve but the more to endear thee to me, till in time, and in a very little time too, I &s;hall get above &s;en&s;e; and then, charmed by thy &s;oul-attracting conver&s;e, and brought to de&s;pi&s;e my former cour&s;es, what I now, at di&s;tance, con&s;ider as a painful duty, will be my joyful choice, and all my delight will centre in thee!</P>
<P>MOWBRAY is ju&s;t arrived with thy letters. I there|fore clo&s;e my agreeable &s;ubject, to attend to one, which I doubt will be very &s;hocking. I have engaged the rough varlet to bear me company in the morning to Berks; where I &s;hall file off the ru&s;t he has contracted in his at|tendance upon the poor fellow.</P>
<P>He tells me, that between the dying Belton, and the preaching Belford, he &s;han't be his own man the&s;e three days. And &s;ays, that thou adde&s;t to the unhappy fellow's weakne&s;s, in&s;tead of giving him courage to help him to bear his de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry he takes the unavoidable lot &s;o heavily. But he has been long ill; and &s;ickne&s;s enervates the mind, as well as the body; as he him&s;elf very &s;ignificantly ob|&s;erved to thee.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedn. Evening.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been reading thy &s;hocking letter.&mdash;Poor Belton! what a multitude of lively hours have we pa&s;&s;ed together! 'Twas a fearle&s;s, chearful fellow!&mdash;Who'd ha' thought all &s;hould end in &s;uch dejected whim|pering and terror?</P>
<P>But, why did&s;t thou not comfort the poor man about the rencounter between him and that poltroon Metcalfe? He acted in that affair like a man of true honour, and as I &s;hould have acted in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Tell him I &s;ay &s;o, and what happened, he could neither help nor fore&s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">Some people are as &s;en&s;ible of a &s;cratch from a pin's point, as others from a pu&s;h of a &s;word: And who can &s;ay any thing for the &s;en&s;ibility of &s;uch fellows? Met|calfe would re&s;ent for his &s;i&s;ter, when his &s;i&s;ter re&s;ented not for her&s;elf. Had &s;he demanded her brother's pro|tection and re&s;entment, that would have been <HI>another man's matter,</HI> as Lord M. phra&s;es it: But &s;he her&s;elf thought her brother a coxcomb to bu&s;y him&s;elf, unde|&s;ired, in her affairs, and wi&s;hed for nothing but to be provided for decently, and privately, in her lying-in; and was willing to take the chance of <HI>Maintenon-ing</HI> his con&s;cience in her favour <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Madam Maintenon was reported to have prevailed upon Lewis XIV. of France, in his old age (&s;unk, as he was, by ill &s;ucce&s;s in the field,) to marry her, by way of compounding with his con&s;cience for the freedoms of his pa&s;t life, to which &s;he attributed his public lo&s;&s;es.</NOTE>, and getting him to marry, when the little &s;tranger came; for &s;he knew what an ea&s;y, good-natured fellow he was. And, indeed, if &s;he <HI>had</HI> prevailed upon him, it might have been happy for both; as then he would not have fallen in with his cur&s;ed Thoma&s;in. But truly this officious brother of hers mu&s;t interpo&s;e. This made a trifling affair important: And what was the i&s;&s;ue? Metcalfe challenged; Belton met him; di&s;armed him; gave him his life: But the fellow, more &s;en&s;ible in his <HI>skin</HI> than in his <HI>head,</HI> having received a &s;cratch, he was frighted; it gave him fir&s;t a puke, then a fever, and then he died. That was all. And how could Belton help that?&mdash;But &s;ickne&s;s, a long tedious &s;ickne&s;s, will make a bugbear of any thing to a lan|gui&s;hing heart, I &s;ee that. And &s;o far was Mowbray <HI>apropos</HI> in the ver&s;es from <HI>Nat. Lee</HI>; which thou ha&s;t tran|&s;cribed.</P>
<P><HI>Merely to die, no man of rea&s;on fears</HI>; is a mi&s;take, &s;ay thou, or &s;ay thy author, what ye will. And thy &s;olemn parading about the natural repugnance between life and death, is a proof that it is.</P>
<P>Let me tell thee, Jack, that &s;o much am I plea&s;ed with this world, in the main; tho' in &s;ome points too, the world, (to make a <HI>per&s;on</HI> of it,) has been a ra&s;cal to me; &s;o delighted am I with the joys of youth; with my world|ly pro&s;pects as to fortune; and now, newly, with the
<PB N="23" REF="24">
charming hopes given me by dear, thrice dear, and for|ever dear Mi&s;s HARLOWE; that were I even &s;ure that nothing bad would come hereafter, I &s;hould be very loth, (very much <HI>afraid</HI> if thou wilt have it &s;o) to lay down my life and them together; and yet upon a call of honour, no man fears death le&s;s than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But I have not either inclination or lei&s;ure to weigh thy <HI>leaden</HI> arguments, except in the <HI>pig,</HI> or, as thou would&s;t &s;ay, in the <HI>lump.</HI></P>
<P>If I return thy letters, let me have them again &s;ome time hence, that is to &s;ay, when I am married, or when poor Belton is half-forgotten; or when <HI>time</HI> has inrolled the hone&s;t fellow among tho&s;e whom we have <HI>&s;o long</HI> lo&s;t, that we may remember them with more plea&s;ure than pain; and then I may give them a &s;erious peru&s;al, and enter with thee as deeply as thou wilt into the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>When I am married,</HI> &s;aid I?&mdash;What a &s;ound has that!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t wait with patience for a &s;ight of this charming creature, till &s;he is at her father's: And yet, as the but blo&s;&s;oming beauty, as thou telle&s;t me, is reduced to a &s;hadow, I &s;hould have been exceedingly delighted to &s;ee her now, and every day till the happy one; that I might have the plea&s;ure of beholding how &s;weetly, hour by hour, &s;he will ri&s;e to her pri&s;tine glories, by means of that &s;tate of ea&s;e and contentment, which will take place of the &s;tormy <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> upon her reconciliation with her friends, and our happy nuptials.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WELL, but now my heart is a little at ea&s;e, I will conde&s;cend to take &s;ome brief notice of &s;ome other pa&s;&s;ages in thy letters.</P>
<P>I find, I am to thank <HI>thee,</HI> that the dear creature has avoided my vi&s;it. Things are now in &s;o good a train, that I mu&s;t forgive thee; el&s;e, &s;houlde&s;t thou have heard more of this new in&s;tance of di&s;loyalty to thy general.</P>
<P>Thou art continually giving thy&s;elf high prai&s;e, by way of <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> as I may &s;ay, to others; gently and artfully blaming thy&s;elf, for qualities, thou woulde&s;t at
<PB N="24" REF="25">
the &s;ame time have to be thought, and which generally are thought, prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>Thus, in the airs thou a&s;&s;ume&s;t about thy &s;ervants, thou would&s;t pa&s;s for a mighty humane mortal, and that at the expence of Mowbray and me; whom thou repre|&s;ente&s;t as kings and emperors to our menials. Yet art thou always unhappy in thy attempts of this kind, and never can&s;t make us, who know thee, believe That to be a virtue in thee, which is but the effect of con&s;titutional phlegm and ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Knowe&s;t thou not, that &s;ome men have a native dig|nity in their manner, that makes them more regarded by a look, than either thou can&s;t be in thy low &s;tyle, or Mowbray in his high?</P>
<P>I am fit to be a prince, I can tell thee; for I reward well, and I puni&s;h &s;ea&s;onably and properly; and I am generally as well &s;erved as any man.</P>
<P>The art of governing the&s;e under-bred varlets, lies more in the dignity of looks than in words, and thou art a &s;orry fellow, to think humanity con&s;i&s;ts in acting by thy &s;ervants, as men mu&s;t act who are not able to pay them their wages; or had made them ma&s;ters of &s;ecrets, which if divulged, would lay them at the mercy of &s;uch wretches.</P>
<P>Now to me, who never did any thing I was a&s;hamed to own, and who have more ingenuity than ever man had; who can call a villainy by its right name, tho' practi&s;ed by my&s;elf, and (by my own readine&s;s to re|proach my&s;elf) anticipate all reproach from others; who am not &s;uch a hypocrite, as to wi&s;h the world to think me other or better than I am: It is my part, to <HI>look</HI> a &s;ervant into his duty, if I can: Nor will I keep one, who knows not how to take me by a nod, or a wink; and who, when I &s;mile, &s;hall not be all tran&s;port; when I frown, all terror. If, indeed, I am out of the way a little, I always take care to reward the varlets for bearing patiently my di&s;plea&s;ure. But this I hardly ever am, but when a fellow is egregiou&s;ly &s;tupid in any plain points of duty, or will be wi&s;er than his ma&s;ter; and when he &s;hall tell me, that he thought acting contrary to my or|ders, was the way to &s;erve me be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">One time or other, I will enter the li&s;ts with thee upon thy conduct and mine to &s;ervants; and I will convince thee, that what thou would&s;t have pa&s;s for humanity, if it be indi&s;criminately practi&s;ed to all tempers, will per|petually &s;ubject thee to the evils thou complaine&s;t of; and <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> too; and that <HI>he</HI> only is fit to be a ma&s;ter of &s;er|vants, who can command their attention as much by a <HI>nod,</HI> as if he were to <HI>pr'ythee</HI> a fellow to do his duty, on one hand, or to talk of <HI>flaying,</HI> and <HI>hor&s;ewhipping,</HI> like Mowbray, on the other: For the &s;ervant who being <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to <HI>expect</HI> thy creeping &s;tyle, will always be ma&s;ter of his ma&s;ter; and he who de&s;erves to be treated as the other, is not fit to be any man's &s;ervant; nor would I keep &s;uch a fellow to rub my hor&s;e's heels.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be the readier to enter the li&s;ts with thee upon this argument, becau&s;e I have pre&s;umption enough to think, that we have not in any of our dramatic poets, that I can at pre&s;ent call to mind, one character of a &s;ervant of either &s;ex, that is ju&s;tly hit off. So ab&s;urdly wi&s;e <HI>&s;ome,</HI> and &s;o &s;otti&s;hly fooli&s;h <HI>others</HI>; and <HI>both</HI> &s;ometimes in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;on. <HI>Foils</HI> drawn from the lees or dregs of the people to &s;et off the characters of their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; nay, &s;ometimes, which is &s;till more ab&s;urd, introduced with more wit than the poet has to be&s;tow upon their principals.&mdash;Mere <HI>&s;tints</HI> and <HI>&s;teels</HI> to &s;trike fire with&mdash;Or, to vary the metaphor, to &s;erve for whet&s;tones to wit, which <HI>other|wi&s;e</HI> could not be made apparent:&mdash;Or for engines to be made u&s;e of like the <HI>machinery</HI> of the ancien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poets (or the &s;till <HI>more</HI> unnatural Soliloquy) to help on a &s;orry plot, or to bring about a nece&s;&s;ary eclairci&s;&s;ement, to &s;ave the poet the trouble of thinking deeply for a better way to wind up his bottoms.</P>
<P>Of this I am per&s;uaded, (whatever my <HI>practice</HI> be to my own &s;ervants) that thou wilt be benefited by my <HI>theory,</HI> when we come to controvert the point. For then I &s;hall convince thee, that the <HI>dramatic</HI> as well as <HI>natural</HI> cha|racteri&s;tics of a good &s;ervant, ought to be fidelity, common &s;en&s;e, chearful obedience, and &s;ilent re&s;pect: That wit in his &s;tation, except to his companions, would be &s;awci|ne&s;s: That he &s;hould never pre&s;ume to give his advice: That if he ventured to expo&s;tulate upon any unrea&s;onable
<PB N="26" REF="27">
command, or &s;uch a one as appeared to him to be &s;o, he &s;hould do it with humility and re&s;pect, and take a proper &s;ea&s;on for it. But &s;uch le&s;&s;ons do mo&s;t of the dramatic performances I have &s;een give, where &s;ervants are intro|duced as characters e&s;&s;ential to the play, or to act very &s;ig|nificant or long parts in it (which, of it&s;elf, I think a fault); &s;uch le&s;&s;ons, I &s;ay, do they give to the footmens gallery, that I have not wondered we have &s;o few mode&s;t or good men-&s;ervants among tho&s;e who often attend their ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to plays. Then how mi&s;erably evi|dent mu&s;t that poet's con&s;cious want of genius be, who can &s;toop to rai&s;e or give force to a clap by the indi&s;cri|minative roar of the party-coloured gallery!</P>
<P>But this &s;ubject I will &s;u&s;pend to a better opportunity; that is to &s;ay, to the happy one, when my nuptials with my Clari&s;&s;a will oblige me to increa&s;e the number of my &s;ervants, and of con&s;equence to enter more nicely into their qualifications.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I have the highe&s;t opinion that man can have, of the genero&s;ity of my dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, yet I cannot for the heart of me account for this agreeable change in her temper, but one way. Faith and troth, Belford, I verily believe, laying all circum&s;tances toge|ther, that the dear creature unexpectedly finds her&s;elf in the way I have &s;o ardently wi&s;hed her to be in; and that this makes her, at la&s;t, incline to favour me, that &s;he may &s;et the better face upon her ge&s;tation, when at her father's.</P>
<P>If this be the ca&s;e, all her &s;ailing away, and her fainting f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, are charmingly accounted for. Nor is it &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;uch a &s;weet novice in the&s;e matters &s;hould not know to what to attribute her frequent indi&s;po&s;itions. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, how &s;hall I laugh at <HI>thee!</HI> and (when I am &s;ure of her) at the dear novice <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> that all her grievous di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;hall end in a man-child: which I &s;hall love better than all the Cherubims and Seraphims that may come after; though there were to be as many of them as I beheld in my dream; in which a va&s;t expan&s;e of ceiling was &s;tuck as full of them as it could hold.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be afraid to open thy next, le&s;t it bring me the account of poor Belton's death. Yet, as there are no
<PB N="27" REF="28">
hopes of his recovery&mdash;But what &s;hould I &s;ay, unle&s;s the poor man were better fitted&mdash;But thy heavy &s;ermon &s;hall not affect me too much neither.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e thy papers: And do thou tran&s;cribe them for me, or return them; for, there are &s;ome things in them, which, at a proper &s;ea&s;on, a <HI>mortal</HI> man &s;hould not avoid attending to: And thou &s;eeme&s;t to have entered deeply into the &s;hocking &s;ubject&mdash;But here I will end, le&s;t I grow too &s;erious.</P>
<P>THY &s;ervant called here about an hour ago, to know if I had any commands: I therefore hope that thou wilt have this early in the morning. And if thou <HI>can&s;t</HI> let me hear from thee, do. I'll &s;tretch an hour or two in expec|tation of it. Yet I mu&s;t be at Lord M.'s to-morrow night, if po&s;&s;ible, though ever &s;o late.</P>
<P>Thy fellow tells me the poor man is much as he was when Mowbray left him.</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou think, that this varlet Mowbray is &s;orry, that I am &s;o near being happy with Mi&s;s Harlowe. And, 'egad, Jack, I know not what to &s;ay to it, now the fruit &s;eems to be within my reach. But, let what will come, I'll &s;tand to't: For I find I can't live without her.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedn. Three o'clock.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL proceed where I left off in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had &s;een Mowbray mounted, I went to attend upon poor Belton, whom I found in dreadful agonies, in which he awoke, as he generally does.</P>
<P>The doctor came in pre&s;ently after; and I was con|cerned at the &s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>It opened with the dying man's a&s;king him, with melan|choly earne&s;tne&s;s, If nothing, if nothing at all, could be done for him?</P>
<P>The doctor &s;hook his head, and told him, he doubted not.</P>
<P>I <HI>cannot</HI> die, &s;aid the poor man; I cannot <HI>think</HI> of dying. I am very de&s;irous of living a little longer, if I could but
<PB N="28" REF="29">
be free from the&s;e horrible pains in my &s;tomach and head. Can you give me nothing to make me pa&s;s one week, but <HI>one</HI> week, in tolerable ea&s;e, that I may die like a man?&mdash;If I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> die!</P>
<P>But, doctor, I am <HI>yet</HI> a young man: in the prime of my years&mdash;Youth is a good &s;ubject for a phy&s;ician to work upon: Can you do nothing, nothing <HI>at all</HI> for me, doctor?</P>
<P>Alas, Sir, replied his phy&s;ician, you have been long in a bad way. I fear, I fear, nothing in phy&s;ic can help you.</P>
<P>He was then out of all patience: What, then, is your art, Sir?&mdash;I have been a pa&s;&s;ive machine for a whole twelvemonth, to be wrought upon at the plea&s;ure of you people of the faculty. I verily believe, had I not taken &s;uch do&s;es of na&s;ty &s;tuff, I had been now a well man&mdash;But who the plague would regard Phy&s;icians, who&s;e art is to cheat us with hopes, while they help to de&s;troy us? And who, not one of you, know any thing but by gue&s;s?</P>
<P>Sir, continued he fiercely, (and with more &s;trength of voice, and coherence, than he had &s;hewn for &s;everal hours before) if you give <HI>me</HI> over, I give <HI>you</HI> over&mdash;The only hone&s;t and certain part of the art of healing is Surgery. A good Surgeon is worth a thou&s;and of you. I have been in Surgeon's hands often, and have always found rea&s;on to depend upon their &s;kill: But <HI>your</HI> art, Sir, what is it&mdash;but to dawb, dawb, dawb; load, load, load; plai&s;ter, plai&s;ter, plai&s;ter; till ye utterly de&s;troy the appetite fir&s;t, and the con&s;titution afterwards, which you are called-in to help. I had a companion once&mdash;My dear Belford, thou knewe&s;t hone&s;t Blomer&mdash;as pretty a phy&s;ician he would have made, as any in England, had he kept him|&s;elf from exce&s;s in wine and women; and he always u&s;ed to &s;ay, there was nothing at all but pick-pocket parade in the Phy&s;icians art; and that the be&s;t gue&s;&s;er was the be&s;t phy&s;ician; and I u&s;ed to believe him too: And yet, fond of life, and fearful of death, what do we do, when we are taken ill, but call ye <HI>in?</HI> And what do <HI>ye</HI> do, when called in, but nur&s;e our di&s;tempers, till from pigmies you make giants of them?&mdash;And then ye come creeping with &s;olemn faces, when ye are a&s;hamed to pre&s;cribe, or when the &s;tomach won't bear its natural food, by rea&s;on of your
<PB N="29" REF="30">
poi&s;onous potions, <HI>Alas! I am afraid phy&s;ic can do no more for him!</HI>&mdash;Nor need it, when it has brought to the brink of the grave, the poor wretch who placed all his reliance in your cur&s;ed &s;lops, and the flattering hopes you gave him.</P>
<P>The doctor was out of countenance; but &s;aid, If we could make mortal men <HI>immortal,</HI> and <HI>would not,</HI> all this might be ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I blamed the poor man; yet excu&s;ed him to the phy|&s;ician. To die, dear doctor, when, like my poor friend, we are &s;o de&s;irous of life, is a melancholy thing. We are apt to hope too much, not con&s;idering that the &s;eeds of death are &s;own in us when we begin to live, and grow up, till, like rampant weeds, they choak the tender flower of life; which declines in us, as tho&s;e weeds flouri&s;h. We ought therefore to begin early to &s;tudy what our con&s;ti|tutions will bear, in order to root out, by temperance, the weeds which the &s;oil is mo&s;t apt to produce; or, at lea&s;t, to keep them down as they ri&s;e; and not, when the flower or plant is withered at the root, and the weed in its full vigour, expect that the medical art will re&s;tore the one, or de&s;troy the other; when that other, as I hinted, has been rooting it&s;elf in the habit from the time of our birth.</P>
<P>This &s;peech, Bob, thou wilt call a <HI>prettine&s;s</HI>; or a WHITE BEAR;&mdash;but the allegory is ju&s;t; and thou ha&s;t not quite cured me of the Metaphorical.</P>
<P>Very true, &s;aid the doctor, you have brought a good metaphor to illu&s;trate the thing. I am &s;orry I can do no|thing for the gentleman; and can only recommend pa|tience, and a better frame of mind.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid the poor angry man, vexed at the doctor, but more at death; you will perhaps recommend the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the phy&s;ician, when <HI>he</HI> can do no more; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, will &s;end your brother to pray by me for tho&s;e virtues which you wi&s;h me.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the phy&s;ician's brother is a clergyman in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>I was greatly concerned to &s;ee the gentleman thus treated; and &s;o I told poor Belton when he was gone: But he continued impatient, and would not be denied, he &s;aid, the liberty of talking to a man, who had taken &s;o many guineas of him for doing nothing, or wor&s;e than
<PB N="30" REF="31">
nothing, and never declined one, though he knew all the time he could do him no good.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, the gentleman, though rich, is noted for being greedy after &s;ees; and poor Belton went on, raving at the extravagant fees of Engli&s;h phy&s;icians, compared with tho&s;e of the mo&s;t eminent foreign ones. But, poor man! he, like the Turks, who judge of a general by his &s;uc|ce&s;s, (out of patience to think he mu&s;t die) would have wor&s;hipped the doctor, and not grudged three times the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, could he have given him hopes of recovery.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that gentlemen of the faculty &s;hould be more moderate in their fees, or take more pains to de&s;erve them: for, generally, they only come into a room, feel the &s;ick man's pul&s;e, a&s;k the nur&s;e a few que&s;tions, in&s;pect the patient's tongue, and perhaps his water; then &s;it down, look plaguy wi&s;e; and <HI>write.</HI> The golden fee finds the ready hand, and they hurry away, as if the &s;ick man's room were infectious. So to the next they troll, and to the next, if men of great practice; va|luing them&s;elves upon the number of vi&s;its they make in a morning, and the little time they make them in. They go to dinner, and unload their pockets; and &s;ally out again to refill them.

<P>Mrs. Sambre (Belton's &s;i&s;ter) had &s;everal times pro|po&s;ed to him a mini&s;ter to pray by him; but the poor man could not, he &s;aid, bear the thoughts of one; for that he &s;hould certainly die in an hour or two after: And he was willing to hope &s;till, again&s;t all probability, that he might recover; and was often a&s;king his &s;i&s;ter, if &s;he had not &s;een people as bad as he was, who, almo&s;t to a miracle, when every body gave them over, had got up again?</P>
<P>She, &s;haking her head, told him, &s;he had: But, once &s;aying, that <HI>their</HI> di&s;orders were of an acute kind, and &s;uch as had a cri&s;is in them, he called her <HI>&s;mall-hopes,</HI> and <HI>Job</HI>'s <HI>comforter</HI>; and bid her &s;ay <HI>nothing,</HI> if &s;he could not &s;ay more to the purpo&s;e, and what was fitter for a &s;ick man to hear.

<P>We are told, that God de&s;ires not the death, the <HI>&s;piri|tual</HI>

<P>I wi&s;h indeed, I <HI>heartily</HI> wi&s;h, we could have &s;een one ray of comfort darting in upon his benighted mind, be|fore he departed. But all, alas! to the very la&s;t ga&s;p, was horror and confu&s;ion. And my only fear ari&s;es from this, That, till within the four la&s;t days of his life, he could not be brought to think he &s;hould die, though in a vi&s;ible decline for months; and, in that pre&s;umption, was too little inclined to &s;et about a &s;erious preparation for a jour|ney, which he hoped he &s;hould not be obliged to take; and when he began to apprehend that he could not put it off, his impatience, and terror, and apprehen&s;ion, &s;hewed too little of that reliance and re&s;ignation, which afford the mo&s;t comfortable reflections to the <HI>friends</HI> of the dying as well as to the <HI>dying</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t leave poor Belton to that mercy, which we have all &s;o much need of; and, for my own part, (do you, Lovelace, and the re&s;t of the fraternity, as ye will) I am re&s;olved, I will endeavour to begin to repent of my follies, while my health is &s;ound, my intellects untouched, and while it is in my power to make &s;ome atonement, as near to re&s;titution as is po&s;&s;ible, to tho&s;e I have wronged or mi&s;&s;ed.

<P>I Received thy letter in &s;uch good time, by thy fellow's di&s;patch, that it gives me an opportunity of throwing in a few paragraphs upon it. I read a pa&s;&s;age or two of it to Mowbray; and we both agree, that thou art an ab|&s;olute ma&s;ter of the Lamentable.</P>
<P>Poor Belton! what terrible conflicts were thy la&s;t con|flicts!&mdash;I hope, however, that he is happy: And I have the more hope, becau&s;e the hardne&s;s of his death is likely to be &s;uch a warning to <HI>thee.</HI> If it have the effect thou declare&s;t it &s;hall have, what a world of mi&s;chief will it prevent! How much good will it do! How many poor wretches will rejoice at the occa&s;ion, (if they know it) however melancholy in it&s;elf, which &s;hall bring them in a compen&s;ation for injuries they had been forced to &s;it down contented with? But, Jack, tho' thy uncle's death has made thee a rich fellow, art thou &s;ure, that the making good of &s;uch a vow, will not totally bankrupt thee?</P>
<P>Thou &s;aye&s;t I may laugh at thee, if I will. Not I, Jack: I do not take it to be a laughing &s;ubject: And I am heartily concerned at the lo&s;s we all have in poor Belton: And when I get a little &s;ettled, and have lei&s;ure to contemplate the vanity of all &s;ublunary things, (a &s;ub|ject
<PB N="35" REF="36">
that will now-and-then, in my gaye&s;t hours, obtrude it&s;elf upon me) it is very likely, that I may talk &s;eriou&s;ly with thee upon the&s;e topics; and, if thou ha&s;t not got too much the &s;tart of me in the repentance thou art en|tering upon, will go hand-in-hand with thee in it. If thou ha&s;t, thou wilt let me ju&s;t keep thee in my eye; for it is an up-hill work, and I &s;hall &s;ee thee, at &s;etting out, at a great di&s;tance; but as thou art a much heavier and clam&s;ier fellow than my&s;elf, I hope that without much puffing and &s;weating, only keeping on a good round dog|trot, I &s;hall be able to overtake thee.</P>
<P>Mean time take back thy letter, as thou de&s;ire&s;t; I would not have it in my pocket upon any account at pre|&s;ent; nor read it once more.</P>
<P>I am going down without &s;eeing my Beloved. I was a ha&s;ty fool to write her a letter, promi&s;ing that I would not come near her, till I &s;aw her at her father's. For as &s;he is now actually at Smith's, and I &s;o near her, one &s;hort vi&s;it could have done no harm.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Will. two hours ago with my grateful compli|ments, and to know how &s;he does. How mu&s;t I adore this charming creature! For I am ready to think my &s;er|vant a happier fellow than my&s;elf, for having been with|in a pair of &s;tairs and an apartment of her!</P>
<P>Mowbray and I will drop a tear apiece, as we ride along, to the memory of poor Belton:&mdash;<HI>As we ride along,</HI> I &s;ay: For we &s;hall have &s;o much joy, when we arrive at Lord M's, and when I communicate to him and my cou&s;ins the dear creature's letter, that we &s;hall forget every thing grievous: Since now their family-hopes in my reformation (the point which lies &s;o near their hearts) will all revive; it being an article of their faith, that if I marry, repentance and mortification will follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Neither Mowbray nor I &s;hall accept of thy <HI>verbal</HI> invitation to the funeral. We like not the&s;e di&s;mal for|malities. And as to the re&s;pect that is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;hewn to the memory of a decea&s;ed friend in &s;uch an at|tendance, why &s;hould we do any thing to reflect upon tho&s;e who have made it a fa&s;hion to leave this parade to people whom they <HI>hire for that purpo&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>Adieu, and be chearful. Thou can&s;t now do no more for poor Belton, wert thou to howl for him to the end of thy life.</P>

<P>ON Thur&s;day afternoon I a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the opening of poor Belton's will, in which he has left me his &s;ole Executor, and bequeathed me a legacy of 100 guineas: which I &s;hall pre&s;ent to his unfortunate &s;i&s;ter, to whom he has not been &s;o kind as I think he ought to have been. He has al&s;o left 20 <HI>l.</HI> apiece to Mowbray, Tourville, thy&s;elf, and me, for a ring to be worn in remembrance of him.</P>
<P>After I had given &s;ome particular orders about the pre|parations to be made for his funeral, I went to town; but having made it late before I got in on Thur&s;day night, and being fatigued for want of re&s;t &s;everal nights before, and low in my &s;pirits, [I could not help it, Love|lace!] I contented my&s;elf to &s;end my compliments to the innocent &s;ufferer, to inquire after her health.</P>
<P>My &s;ervant &s;aw Mrs. Smith, who told him, &s;he was very glad I was come to town; for that the lady was wor&s;e than &s;he had yet been.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to account for the contents of her letter to you; or, to reconcile tho&s;e contents to the facts I have to communicate.</P>
<P>I was at Smith's by &s;even ye&s;terday (Friday) morning; and found that the lady was ju&s;t gone in a chair to St. Dun&s;tan's to prayers; &s;he was too ill to get out by &s;ix to Covent Garden church; and was forced to be &s;upported to her chair by Mrs. Lovick. They would have per&s;uaded her again&s;t going; but &s;he &s;aid &s;he knew not but it would be her la&s;t opportunity. Mrs. Lovick, dreading that &s;he would be taken wor&s;e at church, walked thither before her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith told me, &s;he was &s;o ill on Wedne&s;day night, that &s;he had de&s;ired to receive the Sacrament; and ac|cordingly it was admini&s;tred to her, by the par&s;on of the pari&s;h: Whom &s;he be&s;ought to take all opportunities of a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in her &s;olemn Preparation.</P>
<P>This the gentleman promi&s;ed: And called in the morn|ing to enquire after her health; and was admitted at the fir&s;t word. He &s;taid with her about half an hour; and when he came down, with his face turned a&s;ide, and a faltering accent,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mrs. Smith, &s;aid he, you have an

<P>Her increa&s;ed weakne&s;s &s;he attributed to the fatigues &s;he had undergone by your means; and to a letter &s;he had received from her &s;i&s;ter, which &s;he an&s;wered the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith told me, that two different per&s;ons had called there, one on Thur&s;day morning, one in the even|ing, to inquire after her &s;tate of health; and &s;eemed as if commi&s;&s;ioned from her relations for that purpo&s;e; but a&s;ked not to &s;ee her, only were very inqui&s;itive after her vi&s;itors, (particularly, it &s;eems, after <HI>me:</HI> What could they mean by that?) after her way of life, and expences; and one of them inquired after her manner of &s;upporting them; to the latter of which, Mrs. Smith &s;aid, &s;he had an&s;wered, as the truth was, that &s;he had been obliged to &s;ell &s;ome of her cloaths, and was actually about parting with more; at which the inquiri&s;t (a grave old farmer-looking man) held up his hands, and &s;aid, Good God!&mdash;this will be &s;ad, &s;ad news to &s;omebody!

And then &s;he wrote on for three hours more: After which, being heavy, &s;he dozed a little in an elbow-chair. When &s;he awoke, &s;he or|dered the coachman to drive her very &s;lowly to town, to the hou&s;e of a friend of Mrs. Lovick, whom, as agreed upon, &s;he met there: But, being extremely ill, &s;he would venture home at a late hour, altho' &s;he heard from the widow, that you had been there, and had rea&s;on to be &s;hocked at your behaviour. She &s;aid, She found there was no avoiding you: She was apprehen&s;ive &s;he &s;hould not live many hours, and it was not impo&s;&s;ible but the &s;hock the &s;ight of you mu&s;t give her, would determine her fate in your pre&s;ence.</Q></P>

And not being able to bear an interview with a man &s;o hardened, &s;he took to her u&s;ual chair early in the morning, and was carried to the Temple-&s;tairs, whither &s;he had ordered her nur&s;e before her, to get a pair of oars in readine&s;s (for her fatigues the day before, made her unable to bear a coach); and then &s;he was rowed to Chel&s;ea, where &s;he breakfa&s;ted; and after rowing about, put in at the Swan at Brent|ford-Aight, where &s;he dined; and would have written, but had no conveniency either of tolerable pens, or ink, or private room; and then proceeding to Richmond, they rowed her back to Mortlack; where &s;he put in, and drank tea at a hou&s;e her waterman recommended to her. She wrote there for an hour; and returned to the Temple; and, when &s;he landed, made one of the water|men get her a chair, and &s;o was carried to the widow's friend, as the night before; where &s;he again met the widow, who informed her, that you had been after her twice that day.</Q></P>

<P>On Wedne&s;day morning, when &s;he received your letter in an&s;wer to hers, &s;he &s;aid, Nece&s;&s;ity may well be called the mother of Invention&mdash;But Calamity is the te&s;t of In|tegrity.&mdash;I hope I have not taken an inexcu&s;able &s;tep&mdash;and there &s;he &s;topt a minute or two, and then &s;aid, I &s;hall now, perhaps, be allowed to die in peace.</P>
<P>I &s;taid till &s;he came in. She was glad to &s;ee me; but, being very weak, &s;aid, &s;he mu&s;t &s;it down before &s;he could go up &s;tairs; and &s;o went into the back-&s;hop; leaning upon Mrs. Lovick: And when &s;he had &s;at down,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I am glad to &s;ee you, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he; I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ay &s;o&mdash;let mi&s;|reporters &s;ay what they will.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="41">I wondered at this expre&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Explained hereafter.</NOTE>; but would not inter|rupt her.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I have been grievou&s;ly hara&s;&s;ed. Your friend, who would not let me live with reputation, will not permit me to die in peace.&mdash;You &s;ee how I am&mdash;Is there not a great alteration in me within this week?&mdash;But 'tis all for the better.&mdash;Yet were I to wi&s;h for life, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that your friend, your barbarous friend, has <HI>hurt</HI> me greatly.</P>
<P>She was &s;o very weak, &s;o &s;hort-breath'd, and her words and action &s;o very moving, that I was forced to walk from her; the two women and her nur&s;e, turning away their faces al&s;o, weeping.</P>
<P>I have had, Madam, &s;aid I, &s;ince I &s;aw you, a mo&s;t &s;hocking &s;cene before my eyes for days together. My poor friend Belton is no more. He quitted the world ye&s;terday morning in &s;uch dreadful agonies, that the impre&s;&s;ion it has left upon me, has <HI>&s;o weakened</HI> my mind&mdash;I was loth to have her think, that my grief was owing to the weak &s;tate I &s;aw her in, for fear of di&s;piriting her.</P>
<P>That is only, Mr. Belford, interrupted &s;he, in order to <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> it, if a proper u&s;e be made of the impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But I &s;hould be glad, &s;ince you are &s;o humanely affected with the &s;olemn circum&s;tance, that you could have written an account of it in the &s;tyle and manner you are ma&s;ter of, to your gay friend. Who knows, as it would have come <HI>from</HI> an a&s;&s;ociate and <HI>of</HI> an a&s;&s;ociate, how it might have af|fected him?</P>
<P>That I <HI>had</HI> done, I told her, in &s;uch a manner as had, I believed, &s;ome effect upon you.</P>
<P>His behaviour in this hone&s;t family &s;o lately, &s;aid &s;he, and his cruel pur&s;uit of me, give but little hopes, that any thing &s;erious or &s;olemn will affect him.</P>
<P>We had &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alk about Belton's dying behaviour, and I gave her &s;everal particulars of the poor man's impatience and de&s;pair; to which &s;he was very attentive; and made fine ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ubject of procra&s;tination.</P>
<P>A letter and pacq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et were brought her by a man on hor&s;e-back from Mi&s;s Howe, while we were talking. She retired up-&s;tairs to read it; and while I was in di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="41" REF="42">
with Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick, the doctor and apothecary both came in together. They confirmed to me my fears, as to the dangerous way &s;he is in. They had both been apprized of the new in&s;tances of impla|cablene&s;s in her friends, and of your per&s;ecutions: And the doctor &s;aid, He would not for the world be either the unfor|giving father of that lady, or the man who had brought her to this di&s;tre&s;s. Her heart's broke; &s;he'll die, &s;aid he: There is no &s;aving her. But how, were I either the one or the other of the people I have named, I &s;hould &s;upport my&s;elf afterwards, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>When &s;he was told we were all three together, &s;he de|&s;ired us to walk up. She aro&s;e to receive us, and after an&s;wering two or three general que&s;tions relating to her health, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to us, to the following effect.</P>
<P>As I may not, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ee you three gentlemen toge|ther again, let me take this opportunity to acknowlege my obligations to you all. I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly obliged to You, Sir, and to You, Sir (courte&s;ying to the doctor and to Mr. Goddard) for your <HI>more</HI> than friendly, your <HI>pa|ternal</HI> care and concern for me. Humanity in your pro|fe&s;&s;ion, I dare &s;ay, is far from being a rare qualification, becau&s;e you are gentlemen <HI>by</HI> your profe&s;&s;ion: But &s;o much kindne&s;s, &s;o much humanity, did never de&s;olate crea|ture meet with, as I have met with from you both. But indeed I have always ob&s;erved, that where a per&s;on relies upon Providence, it never fails to rai&s;e up a new friend for every old one that falls off.</P>
<P>This gentleman, (bowing to me) who, &s;ome people think, &s;hould have been one of the la&s;t I &s;hould have thought of as my Executor&mdash;is neverthele&s;s, (&s;uch is the &s;trange chance of things!) the only one I can choo&s;e; and therefore I have cho&s;en him for that charitable office, and he has been &s;o good as to accept of it: For rich, as I may boa&s;t my&s;elf to be, I am rather &s;o in <HI>right,</HI> than in <HI>fact,</HI> at this pre&s;ent. I repeat therefore my humble thanks to you all three, and beg of God to return to You and Yours, (looking to each) an hundredfold, the kindne&s;s and favour you have &s;hewn me; and that it may be in the power of You and of Yours to the end of time, to confer
<PB N="42" REF="43">
benefits, rather than to be obliged to receive them. This is a god-like power, gentlemen: I once rejoiced in it, in &s;ome little degree; and much more in the pro&s;pect I had of its being inlarged to me; tho' I have had the mortifi|cation to experience the rever&s;e, and to be obliged almo&s;t to every body I have &s;een or met with: But all, origi|nally, thro' my own fault; &s;o I ought to bear the puni&s;h|ment without repining: And I hope I do.&mdash;Forgive the&s;e impertinencies: A grateful heart, that wants the power it wi&s;hes for, to expre&s;s it&s;elf &s;uitably to its own impul&s;es, will be at a lo&s;s what properly to dictate to the tongue; and yet, unable to re&s;train its overflowings, will force it to &s;ay weak and &s;illy things, rather than appear ingratefully &s;ilent. Once more then, I thank ye all three for your kindne&s;s to me: And God Almighty make you that amends which at pre&s;ent I cannot!</P>
<P>She retired from us to her clo&s;et with her eyes full; and left us looking upon one another.</P>
<P>We had hardly recovered our&s;elves, when &s;he, quite ea&s;y, chearful, and &s;miling, returned to us. Doctor, &s;aid &s;he (&s;eeing we had been moved) you will excu&s;e me for the concern I give you; and &s;o will You, Mr. Goddard, and You, Mr. Belford; for 'tis a concern that only gene|rous natures can &s;hew; and to &s;uch natures <HI>&s;weet</HI> is the pain, if I may &s;o &s;ay, that attends &s;uch a concern. But as I have &s;ome few preparations &s;till to make, and would not (tho' in ea&s;e of Mr. Belford's future cares, which is, and ought to be, part of my &s;tudy) undertake more than it is likely I &s;hall have time lent me to perform, I would beg of you to give me your opinions, (You &s;ee my way of living; and you may be a&s;&s;ured, that I will do nothing wilfully to &s;horten my life) how long it may po&s;&s;ibly be, before I may hope to be relea&s;ed from all my troubles.</P>
<P>They both he&s;itated, and looked upon each other. Don't be afraid to an&s;wer me, &s;aid &s;he, each &s;weet hand pre&s;&s;ing upon the arm of each gentleman, with that mingled freedom and re&s;erve, which virgin mode&s;ty, mixed with con&s;cious dignity, can only expre&s;s, and with a look &s;erenely earne&s;t, Tell me how long you think I may hold it? And believe me, gentlemen, the &s;horter
<PB N="43" REF="44">
you tell me my time is likely to be, the more comfort you will give me.</P>
<P>With what plea&s;ing woe, &s;aid the doctor, do you fill the minds of tho&s;e who have the happine&s;s to conver&s;e with you, and &s;ee the happy frame you are in! What you have undergone within a few days pa&s;t, has much hurt you: And &s;hould you have fre&s;h troubles of tho&s;e kinds, I could not be an&s;werable for your holding it&mdash;And there he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>How long, doctor?&mdash;I believe I <HI>&s;hall</HI> have a little more ruffling&mdash;I am afraid I &s;hall&mdash;But there can happen only one thing that I &s;hall not be tolerably ea&s;y under&mdash;How long then, Sir?&mdash;</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>A Fortnight, Sir?</P>
<P>He was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Ten days?&mdash;A week?&mdash;How long, Sir? with &s;miling earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>If I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;peak, Madam, If you have not better treat|ment than you have lately met with, I am afraid&mdash;There again he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Afraid of what, doctor? Don't be afraid&mdash;How long&punc; Sir?</P>
<P>That a fortnight or three weeks may deprive the world of the fine&s;t flower in it.</P>
<P>A fortnight or three weeks yet, doctor!&mdash;But, God's will be done! I &s;hall, however, by this means, have full time, if I have but &s;trength and intellect, to do all that is now upon my mind to do. And &s;o, Sirs, I can but once more thank you, turning to each of us, for all your good|ne&s;s to me; and, having letters to write, will take up no more of your time&mdash;Only, doctor, be plea&s;ed to order me &s;ome more of tho&s;e drops: They chear me a little, when I am low; and, putting a fee into his unwilling hand&mdash;You know the terms, Sir!&mdash;Then, turning to Mr. God|dard, You'll be &s;o good, Sir, as to look in upon me to|night, or to-morrow, as you have opportunity: And you, Mr. Belford, I know, will be de&s;irous to &s;et out to prepare for the la&s;t office for your late friend: So I wi&s;h you a good journey, and hope to &s;ee you when that is performed.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">She then retired, with a chearful and &s;erene air. The two gentlemen went away together. I went down to the women, and, inquiring, found, that Mrs. Lovick was this day to bring her twenty guineas more, for &s;ome other of her apparel.</P>
<P>The widow told me, that &s;he had taken the liberty to expo&s;tulate with her, upon the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> &s;he had for rai&s;ing this money, to &s;uch great di&s;advantage; and it produced the following &s;hort, and affecting conver&s;ation between them.</P>
<P>None of my friends will wear any thing of mine, &s;aid &s;he. I &s;hall leave a great many good things behind me&mdash;And as to what I want the money for&mdash;don't be &s;ur|prized:&mdash;but &s;uppo&s;e I want it to purcha&s;e a hou&s;e?</P>
<P>You are all my&s;tery, Madam, I don't comprehend you.</P>
<P>Why, then, Mrs. Lovick, I will explain my&s;elf: I have a man, not a woman, for my Executor: And think you that I will leave to his care any thing that concerns my own per&s;on?&mdash;Now, Mrs. Lovick, &s;miling, do you com|prehend me?</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick wept.</P>
<P>O fie! proceeded the lady, drying up her tears with her own handkerchief, and giving her a ki&s;s&mdash;Why this kind weakne&s;s for one, whom you have been &s;o little a while acquainted with? Dear, good Mrs. Lovick, don't be con|cerned for me on a pro&s;pect which I have occa&s;ion to be plea&s;ed with; but go to-morrow to your friends, and bring me the money they have agreed to give you.</P>
<P>Thus, Lovelace, is it plain, that &s;he means to be&s;peak her <HI>la&s;t</HI> hou&s;e! Here's pre&s;ence of mind; here's tranquil|lity of heart, on the mo&s;t affecting occa&s;ion!&mdash;This is magnanimity indeed!&mdash;Could&s;t thou, or could I, with all our boi&s;t'rous bravery, and offen&s;ive fal&s;e courage, act thus?&mdash;Poor Belton! how unlike was thy behaviour?</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick tells me, that the lady &s;poke of a letter &s;he had received from her favourite divine Dr. Lewin, in the time of my ab&s;ence. And of an an&s;wer &s;he had re|turned to it. But Mrs. Lovick knows not the contents of either.</P>
<P>When thou receive&s;t this letter, thou wilt &s;ee what will &s;oon be the end of all thy injuries to this divine lady. I

<P>This letter having detained me by its length, I &s;hall not now &s;et out for Ep&s;om till to-morrow.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, that the lady explained to me, what the <HI>one thing</HI> was, that &s;he was afraid might happen to ruffle her. It was the apprehen&s;ion of what may re&s;ult from a vi&s;it which Col. Morden, as &s;he is informed, de|&s;igns to make <HI>you.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, Aug.</HI> 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>PRe&s;uming, deare&s;t and ever-re&s;pectable young lady, up|on your former favour, and upon your opinion of my judgment and &s;incerity, I cannot help addre&s;&s;ing you by a few lines, on your pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I will not look back upon the mea&s;ures which you have either been <HI>led</HI> or <HI>driven</HI> into: But will only &s;ay as to <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> that I think you are the lea&s;t to blame of any young lady that was ever reduced from happy to unhappy circum|&s;tances; and I have not been wanting to &s;ay as much, where I hoped my freedom would have been better received, than I have had the mortification to find it to be.</P>
<P>What I principally write for now, is, to put you upon doing a piece of ju&s;tice to your&s;elf, and to your &s;ex, in the pro&s;ecuting for his life (I am a&s;&s;ured his life is in your power) the mo&s;t profligate and abandoned of men, as <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t be, who could act &s;o ba&s;ely, as I under&s;tand Mr. Lovelace has acted by you.</P>
<P>I am very ill; and am now forced to write upon my pillow; my thoughts confu&s;ed; and incapable of method: I &s;hall not therefore aim at method: But to give you in general my opinion; and that is, That your religion, your duty to your family, the duty you owe to your honour, and even charity to your &s;ex, oblige you to give public evidence again&s;t this very wicked man.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">And let me add, another con&s;ideration; The prevention, by this means, of the mi&s;chiefs that may otherwi&s;e happen between your brother and Mr. Lovelace, or between the latter and your cou&s;in Morden, who is now, I hear, ar|rived, and re&s;olves to have ju&s;tice done you.</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration which ought to affect your con&s;cience; (Forgive me, deare&s;t young lady, I think I am now in the way of my duty) and to be of more concern to you, than that hard pre&s;&s;ure upon your mode&s;ty, which I know the appearance again&s;t him in an open Court, mu&s;t be of to &s;uch a lady as you: And which, I conceive, will be your great difficulty. But I know, Madam, that you have dignity enough to <HI>become</HI> the blu&s;hes of the mo&s;t naked truth, when nece&s;&s;ity, ju&s;tice and honour, exact it from you. Rakes and Ravi&s;hers would meet with encouragement <HI>indeed,</HI> and mo&s;t from tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t abhorrence of their actions, if violated mode&s;ty were never to complain of the injury it received from the villainous attempters of it.</P>
<P>In a word, the reparation of your family di&s;honour, now re&s;ts in your own bo&s;om: and which only one of the&s;e two alternatives <HI>can</HI> repair; to wit, either to Marry, or to pro&s;ecute him at Law. Bitter expedients for a &s;oul &s;o deli|cate as yours.</P>
<P>He, and all his friends, I under&s;tand, &s;ollicit you to the fir&s;t: And it is certainly, now, all the amends within his power to make. But I am a&s;&s;ured, that you have rejected <HI>their</HI> &s;ollicitations, and <HI>his,</HI> with the indignation and con|tempt that his foul actions have de&s;erved: But yet, that you refu&s;e not to extend to him the Chri&s;tian forgivene&s;s he has &s;o little rea&s;on to expect, provided he will not di&s;turb you further.</P>
<P>But, Madam, the pro&s;ecution I advi&s;e, will not let your pre&s;ent and future exemption from fre&s;h di&s;turbance from &s;o vile a mole&s;ter, depend upon his <HI>courte&s;y:</HI> I &s;hould think &s;o noble and &s;o rightly-guided a &s;pirit as yours, would not permit that it &s;hould, if you could help it.</P>
<P>And can indignities of any kind be <HI>properly pardoned,</HI> till we have it in <HI>our power to puni&s;h them?</HI> To pretend to pardon, while we are labouring under the pain or di&s;honour of them, will be thought by &s;ome, to be but the vaunted mercy of a pu&s;ilanimous heart trembling to re&s;ent them.
<PB N="47" REF="48">
The remedy I propo&s;e, is a &s;evere one; but what pain can be more &s;evere than the injury? or how will injuries be believed to grieve us, that are never honourably com|plained of?</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, however injured, and oppre&s;&s;ed, remains un&s;haken in her &s;entiments of honour, and virtue: And although &s;he would &s;ooner die, than <HI>de|&s;erve</HI> that her mode&s;ty &s;hould be drawn into que&s;tion; yet &s;he will think no truth immode&s;t, that is to be uttered in the vindicated cau&s;e of innocence and cha&s;tity. Little, very little difference, is there, my dear young lady, be|tween a <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ed</HI> evidence, and a <HI>fal&s;e</HI> one.</P>
<P>It is a terrible circum&s;tance, I once more own, for a young lady of your delicacy, to be under the obligation of telling &s;o &s;hocking a &s;tory in public Court: But it is &s;till a wor&s;e imputation, that &s;he &s;hould pa&s;s over &s;o mortal an injury unre&s;ented.</P>
<P>Con&s;cience, honour, ju&s;tice, and the cares of heaven, are on your &s;ide: And mode&s;ty would, by &s;ome, be thought but an empty name, &s;hould you refu&s;e to obey their dictates.</P>
<P>I have been con&s;ulted, I own, on this &s;ubject. I have given it, as my opinion, that you ought to pro&s;ecute the abandoned man. But without my rea&s;ons. The&s;e I re|&s;erved, with a re&s;olution to lay them before you, unknown to any body; that the re&s;ult (if what I wi&s;h) might be <HI>your own.</HI></P>
<P>I will only add, that the misfortunes which have be|fallen you, had they been the lot of a child of my own, could not have affected me more, than yours have done. My own child I love: But I both love and honour you: Since to love you, is to love virtue, good &s;en&s;e, prudence, and every thing that is good and noble in woman.</P>
<P>Wounded as I think all the&s;e are by the injuries, you have received, you will believe that the knowlege of your di&s;tre&s;&s;es mu&s;t have afflicted, beyond what I am able to expre&s;s,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sat. Aug.</HI> 19.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Reverend and Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought, till I received your affectionate and welcome letter, that I had neither father, uncle, brother left; nor hardly a friend among my former favourers of your &s;ex. Yet, knowing <HI>you</HI> &s;o well, and having no rea&s;on to upbraid my&s;elf with a faulty will, I was to blame (even although I had doubted the continuance of your good opi|nion) to decline the tryal whether I had forfeited it or not; and if I had, whether I could not, <HI>honourably,</HI> re|in&s;tate my&s;elf in it.</P>
<P>But, Sir, it was owing to different cau&s;es that I did not; partly to <HI>&s;hame,</HI> to think how high, in my happier days, I &s;tood in your e&s;teem, and how much I mu&s;t be &s;unk in it, &s;ince tho&s;e &s;o much nearer in relation to me, gave me up; partly to <HI>deep di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> which makes the humbled heart diffident; and made mine afraid to claim the kindred mind in yours, which would have &s;upplied to me, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, all the dear and lo&s;t relations I have named.</P>
<P>Then, So loth, as I &s;ometimes was, to be thought to want to make a <HI>party</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e whom both duty and inclination bid me reverence: So long <HI>trailed</HI> on between <HI>hope and doubt:</HI> So <HI>little mine own mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> at one time; &s;o fearful of <HI>making or cau&s;ing mi&s;chief,</HI> at another; and not being encouraged to hope, by <HI>your kind notice,</HI> that my application to you would be acceptable;&mdash;apprehending, that my relations had engaged your <HI>&s;ilence</HI> at lea&s;t <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The &s;tiff vi&s;it this good divine was prevailed upon to make her, as mentioned Vol. II. p. 162. (of which, however, &s;he was too generous to remind him) might warrant the lady to think, that he had ra|ther inclined to their party, as the <HI>parental &s;ide,</HI> than to hers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE&mdash;But why the&s;e unavailing retro&s;pections now? I <HI>was</HI> to be unhappy&mdash;in order to <HI>be</HI> happy; that is my hope:&mdash;Re&s;igning, therefore, to That hope, I will, without any further preamble, write a few lines (if writing
<PB N="49" REF="50">
to <HI>you,</HI> I can write <HI>but</HI> a few) in an&s;wer to the &s;ubject of your kind letter.</P>
<P>Permit me, then, to &s;ay, That I believe your arguments would have been unan&s;werable in almo&s;t every <HI>other</HI> ca&s;e of This nature, but in That of the unhappy <HI>Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe.</HI></P>
<P>It is certain, that creatures who cannot &s;tand the &s;hock of <HI>public &s;hame,</HI> &s;hould be doubly careful how they expo&s;e them&s;elves to the danger of incurring <HI>private guilt,</HI> which may po&s;&s;ibly bring them to it: But as to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e there were no objections from the declining way I am in as to my health; and &s;uppo&s;ing I could have prevailed upon my&s;elf to appear again&s;t This man, was there not room to apprehend, that the end &s;o much wi&s;hed for by my friends, (to wit, his condign puni&s;hment) would not have been ob|tained, when it came to be &s;een, that I had con&s;ented to give him a clande&s;tine meeting; and, in con&s;equence of that, had been weakly tricked out of my&s;elf; and further &s;till, had not been able to avoid living under one roof with him for &s;everal weeks; which I did, not only without com|plaint, but without <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of complaint.</P>
<P>Little advantage <HI>in a court</HI> (perhaps, bandied about, and je&s;ted profligately with) would &s;ome of tho&s;e pleas in my favour have been, which <HI>out of court,</HI> and to a <HI>private</HI> and <HI>&s;erious</HI> audience, would have carried the greate&s;t weight again&s;t him&mdash;Such, particularly, as the infamous methods to which he had recour&s;e.</P>
<P>It would, no doubt, have been a ready retort from <HI>every</HI> mouth, that I ought not to have thrown my&s;elf into the power of &s;uch a man, and that I ought to take for my pains what had befallen me.</P>
<P>But had the pro&s;ecution been carried on to <HI>effect,</HI> and had he even been <HI>&s;entenced to death,</HI> can it be thought, that his family would not have had intere&s;t enough to ob|tain his pardon for a crime thought too lightly of, though one of the greate&s;t that can be committed again&s;t a crea|ture valuing her honour above her life?&mdash;While I had been cen&s;ured as pur&s;uing with &s;anguinary views a man who offered me early all the reparation in his power to make?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="51">And had he been <HI>pardoned,</HI> would he not then have been at liberty to do as much mi&s;chief as ever?</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, Sir, &s;uch is the a&s;&s;urance of the man upon whom my unhappy de&s;tiny threw me; and &s;uch his inve|teracy to my family (which would then have appeared to be ju&s;tified by their known inveteracy to <HI>him,</HI> and by their earne&s;t endeavours to take away his life) that he would not have been &s;orry to have had an opportunity to confront me and my father, uncles, and brother, at the Bar of a court of ju&s;tice, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. In which ca&s;e, would not, on his acquittal, or pardon, re&s;entments have been reciprocally heightened? And then would my bro|ther, or my cou&s;in Morden, have been more &s;ecure than now?</P>
<P>How do the&s;e con&s;iderations aggravate my fault? My motives, at fir&s;t, were not indeed blameable: But I had forgotten the excellent caution, which yet I was not ig|norant of, <HI>That we ought not to do evil that good may come of it.</HI></P>
<P>In full conviction of the purity of my heart, and of the firmne&s;s of my principles (Why may I not, thus called upon, &s;ay what I am con&s;cious of, and yet, without faulty pride; &s;ince all is but a <HI>duty,</HI> and I &s;hould be utterly inex|cu&s;able, could I not ju&s;tly &s;ay what I do?) In this full con|viction, he has offered me marriage. He has avowed his penitence: A <HI>&s;incere</HI> penitence I have rea&s;on to think it, tho' perhaps not a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> one. And his noble relations, (kinder to the poor &s;ufferer than her own) on the &s;ame conviction, and his own not ungenerous acknowlege|ments, have joined to intercede with me to <HI>forgive</HI> and <HI>accept</HI> of him. Altho' I cannot comply with the latter part of their interce&s;&s;ion, have not you, Sir, from the <HI>be&s;t</HI> rules, and from the <HI>divine&s;t</HI> example, taught me to forgive in|juries?</P>
<P>The injury I have received from him is indeed of the highe&s;t nature, and it was attended with circum&s;tances of unmanly ba&s;ene&s;s, and premeditation; yet, I ble&s;s God, it has not tainted my mind; it has not hurt my morals. No thanks, indeed, to the wicked man, that it has not. No vile cour&s;es have followed it. My will is unviolated. The
<PB N="51" REF="52">
evil (re&s;pecting <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and not my <HI>friends</HI>) is merely per|&s;onal. No credulity, no weakne&s;s, no want of vigilance, have I to reproach my&s;elf with. I have, thro' grace, triumphed over the deepe&s;t machinations. I have e&s;caped from him. I have renounced him. The man whom once I could have loved, I have been enabled to de&s;pi&s;e: And &s;hall not <HI>charity</HI> complete my triumph? And &s;hall I not <HI>enjoy</HI> it?&mdash;And where would be my triumph, if he <HI>de&s;erved</HI> my forgivene&s;s?&mdash;Poor man! He has had a lo&s;s in lo&s;ing me! I have the pride to think &s;o, becau&s;e I think I know my own heart. I have had none in lo&s;ing him!</P>
<P>But I have <HI>another</HI> plea to make, which alone would have been enough (as I pre&s;ume) to an&s;wer the contents of your very kind and friendly letter.</P>
<P>I know, my dear and reverend friend, the &s;piritual guide and director of my happier days! I know, that you will al|low of my endeavour to bring my&s;elf to this charitable di&s;|po&s;ition, when I tell you how near I think my&s;elf to that great and awful moment, <HI>in</HI> which, and even in the ardent preparation <HI>to</HI> which, every &s;en&s;e of indignity or injury, that concerns not the immortal &s;oul, ought to be ab&s;orbed in higher and more important contemplations.</P>
<P>Thus much for <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>And for the &s;atisfaction of my <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>favourers.</HI> Mi&s;s Howe is &s;ollicitous to have all tho&s;e letters and mate|rials pre&s;erved, which will &s;et my whole &s;tory in a true light. The good Dr. Lewen is one of the principal of tho&s;e friends and favourers.</P>
<P>The warning that may be given from tho&s;e papers to all &s;uch young creatures as may have known or heard of me, may be more efficacious, as I humbly pre&s;ume to think, to the end wi&s;hed for, than my appearance could have been in a court of ju&s;tice, pur&s;uing a doubtful event, under the di&s;advantages I have mentioned. And if, my dear and good Sir, you are now, on con&s;idering every thing, of <HI>this</HI> opinion, and I could <HI>know</HI> it, I &s;hould con&s;ider it as a par|ticular felicity; being as &s;ollicitous as ever to be ju&s;tified in what I may, in your eyes.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, that your indi&s;po&s;ition has reduced you to the nece&s;&s;ity of writing upon your pillow. But how much am I obliged to that kind and generous concern for
<PB N="52" REF="53">
me, which has <HI>impelled</HI> you, as I may &s;ay, to write a letter, containing &s;o many paternal lines, with &s;uch inconvenience to your&s;elf!</P>
<P>May the Almighty ble&s;s you, dear and reverend Sir, for all your goodne&s;s to me, both of now, and of long &s;tand|ing! Continue to e&s;teem me to the la&s;t, as I do, and will, venerate you! And let me be&s;peak your prayers; the <HI>con|tinuance,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, of your prayers; for I doubt not that I have always had them: And to them, perhaps, has in part been owing, (as well as to your pious precepts thro' my earlier youth) that I have been able to make the &s;tand I have made; altho' every thing that you prayed for has not been granted to me, by that Divine Wi&s;dom, which knows what is be&s;t for its poor creatures.</P>
<P>My prayers for <HI>you</HI> are, That it will plea&s;e God to re|&s;tore you to your affectionate flock; and after as many years of life as &s;hall be for <HI>His</HI> &s;ervice, and to <HI>your own</HI> comfort, give us a happy meeting in tho&s;e regions of ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s, which you have taught me, as well by <HI>example,</HI> as by <HI>precept,</HI> to a&s;pire to!</P>

<SALUTE><HI>Si&s;ter</HI> CLARY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find by your letters to my uncles, that they, as well as I, are in great di&s;grace with you for writing our minds to you.</P>
<P>We can't help it, &s;i&s;ter Clary.</P>
<P>You don't think it worth your while, I find, to pre&s;s for the ble&s;&s;ing you pretend to be &s;o earne&s;t about, a &s;econd time: You think, no doubt, that you have done your duty in a&s;king for it: So you'll &s;it down &s;atisfy'd with That, I &s;uppo&s;e, and leave it to your wounded parents to repent hereafter that they have not done <HI>Theirs,</HI> in giving it to you, at the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> word; and in making &s;uch enquiries about you, as you think ought to have been made. Fine encou|ragement
<PB N="53" REF="54">
to inquire after a run-away daughter! living with her fellow, as long as he would live with her! You repent al&s;o, (with your <HI>full mind,</HI> as you mode&s;tly call it) that you wrote to me.</P>
<P>So we are not likely to be applied to any more, I find, in this way.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;ince This is the ca&s;e, &s;i&s;ter Clary, let me, <HI>with all humility,</HI> addre&s;s my&s;elf with a propo&s;al or two to you; to which you will be <HI>graciou&s;ly</HI> plea&s;ed to give an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, that we have had hints given us from &s;everal quarters, that you have been u&s;ed in &s;uch a manner by the villain you ran away with, that his life would be an&s;werable for his crime, if it were fairly to be proved. And, by your own hints, &s;omething like it ap|pears to us.</P>
<P>If, Clary, there be any thing but jingle and affecting pe|riod, in what proceeds from your <HI>full mind,</HI> and your <HI>du|tiful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; and if there be truth in what Mrs. Nor|ton and Mrs. Howe have acquainted us with; you may yet ju&s;tify your character to us, and to the world, in every thing but your &s;candalous elopement; and the Law may reach the villain: And, could we but bring him to the gal|lows, what a meritorious revenge would that be to our whole injured family, and to the innocents he has deluded, as well as the &s;aving from ruin many others?</P>
<P>Let me, therefore, know (if you plea&s;e) whether you are willing to appear to do <HI>Your&s;elf,</HI> and <HI>Us,</HI> and your <HI>Sex,</HI> this ju&s;tice? If <HI>not,</HI> &s;i&s;ter Clary, we &s;hall know what to think of you; for neither <HI>you</HI> nor <HI>we</HI> can &s;uffer more than we have done, from the &s;candal of your fall: And, if <HI>you will,</HI> Mr. Ackland and Coun&s;ellor Derham will both at|tend you to make <HI>proper enquiries,</HI> and to take minutes of your &s;tory, to found a proce&s;s upon, if it will bear one, with as great a probability of &s;ucce&s;s, as we are told it may be pro&s;ecuted with.</P>
<P>But, by what Mrs. Howe intimates, this is not likely to be complied with; for it is what &s;he hinted to you, it &s;eems, by her lively daughter, but without effect <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VI. Letter xxiv.</NOTE>; and then, again, po&s;&s;ibly, you may not at pre&s;ent behave &s;o
<PB N="54" REF="55">
prudently in &s;ome certain points, as to intitle your&s;elf to public ju&s;tice; which if true, the Lord have mercy upon you!</P>
<P>One word only more as to the above propo&s;al;&mdash;Your admirer, Dr. Lewen, is clear in his opinion, that you &s;hould pro&s;ecute the villain.</P>
<P>But if you will not agree to this, I have another propo&s;al to make to you, and that in the name of every one in the family; which is, that you will think of going to Pen&s;yl|vania to re&s;ide there for &s;ome few years, till all is blown over; and, if it plea&s;e God to &s;pare you, and your unhappy parents, till they can be &s;atisfied, that you behave like a true and uniform penitent; at lea&s;t till you are one-and-twenty; you may then come back to your own e&s;tate, or have the produce of it &s;ent you thither, as you &s;hall choo&s;e. A period which my papa fixes, becau&s;e it is the <HI>cu&s;tom</HI>; and becau&s;e he thinks your <HI>grandfather</HI> &s;hould have fixed it; and becau&s;e, let <HI>me</HI> add, you have fully proved by your fine conduct, that you were not at years of di&s;cretion at <HI>eighteen.</HI> Poor doting, tho' good old man!&mdash;Your grand|father he thought&mdash;But I would not be too &s;evere.</P>
<P>Mr. Hartley has a widow-&s;i&s;ter at Pen&s;ylvania, with whom he will undertake you may board, and who is a &s;o|ber, &s;en&s;ible, and well-read woman. And if you were once well there, it would rid your father and mother of a world of cares, and fears, and &s;candal; and I think is what you &s;hould wi&s;h for of all things.</P>
<P>Mr. Hartley will engage for all accommodations in your pa&s;&s;age &s;uitable to your rank and fortune; and he has a concern in a &s;hip, which will &s;ail in a month; and you may take your &s;ecret-keeping Hannah with you, or whom you will of your newer acquaintance. 'Tis pre&s;umed it will be of your own &s;ex.</P>
<P>The&s;e are what I had to communicate to you; and if you'll oblige me with an an&s;wer (which the hand that con|veys this will call for on Wedne&s;day Morning) it will be very conde&s;cending.</P>

<P>WRITE to me, my hard-hearted &s;i&s;ter, in what manner you plea&s;e, I &s;hall always be thankful to you for your notice. But (think what you will of me) I cannot &s;ee Mr. Ackland and the Coun&s;ellor on &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s as you mention.</P>
<P><HI>The Lord have mercy upon me indeed</HI>! For none el&s;e will.</P>
<P>Surely I am believed to be a creature pa&s;t all &s;hame, or it could not be thought of &s;ending two <HI>gentlemen</HI> to me on &s;uch an errand.</P>
<P>Had my mother required of me (or would <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> have permitted you to enquire into) the particulars of my &s;ad &s;tory, or had Mrs. Norton been directed to receive them from me, methinks it had been more fit; and, I pre|&s;ume to think, more in every one's character too, had they been required of me before &s;uch heavy judgment had pa&s;&s;ed upon me, as has been pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I know that this is Dr. Lewen's opinion. He has been &s;o good as to inforce it in a kind letter to me.

<P>To your other propo&s;al, of going to Pen&s;ylvania; this is my an&s;wer:&mdash;If nothing happen within a month which may full as effectually rid my parents and friends of that world of cares, and fears, and &s;candals, which you men|tion, and if I am <HI>then</HI> able to be carried on board of &s;hip, I will chearfully obey my father and mother, altho' I were &s;ure to die in the pa&s;&s;age. And, if I may be forgiven for &s;aying &s;o, you &s;hall &s;et over me, in&s;tead of my poor ob|liging, but really unculpable Hannah, your Betty Barnes; to whom I will be an&s;werable for all my conduct. And I will make it worth her while to accompany me.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">I am equally &s;urprized and concerned at the hints which both you and my uncle Antony give of <HI>new</HI> points of mi&s;behaviour in me!&mdash;What can be meant by them?</P>
<P>I will not tell you, Mi&s;s Harlowe, how much I am af|flicted at your &s;everity, and how much I &s;uffer by it, and by your hard-hearted levity of &s;tyle, becau&s;e what I &s;hall &s;ay may be con&s;trued into <HI>jingle</HI> and <HI>period,</HI> and becau&s;e I know it is <HI>intended</HI> (very po&s;&s;ibly for <HI>kind</HI> ends) to mortify me.

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t young Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Letters you &s;ent me, I now return by the hand that brings you this.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to expre&s;s how much I have been affected by them, and your la&s;t of the 17th. Indeed, my dear Mi&s;s Clary, you are very har&s;hly u&s;ed; indeed you are! And if you &s;hould be taken from us, what grief, and what puni&s;hment, are they not trea&s;uring up again&s;t them|&s;elves, in the heavy reflections which their ra&s;h cen&s;ures and unforgivene&s;s will occa&s;ion them!</P>
<P>But I find what your uncle Antony's cruel letter is ow|ing to, as well as one you will be &s;till more afflicted by, (God help you, my poor dear child!) when it comes to your hand, written by your &s;i&s;ter, with propo&s;als to you.</P>
<P>It was fini&s;hed, to &s;end you, ye&s;terday, I know; and I appri&s;e you of it, that you &s;hould fortify your heart again&s;t the contents of it.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">The motives, which incline them all to this &s;everity, if well-grounded, would authorize any &s;everity, they could expre&s;s, and which, while they believe them to be &s;o, both They and You are to be equally pitied.</P>
<P>They are owing to the information of that officious Mr. Brand, who has acquainted them from &s;ome enemy of yours in the neighbourhood about you, that vi&s;its are made you, highly cen&s;urable, from a man of a free character, and an intimate of Mr. Lovelace; who is often in private with you; &s;ometimes twice or thrice a day.</P>
<P>Betty gives her&s;elf great liberties of &s;peech upon this occa&s;ion, and all your friends are too ready to believe, that things are not as they &s;hould be: which makes me wi&s;h, that, let the gentleman's views be ever &s;o honourable, you could intirely drop acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>Something of this nature was hinted at by Betty to me before, but &s;o darkly, that I could not tell what to make of it; and this made me mention it to you &s;o <HI>generally,</HI> as I did in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>Your cou&s;in Morden has been among them: He is ex|ceedingly concerned for your misfortunes; and as they will not believe Mr. Lovelace would marry you, he is de|termined to go to Lord M.'s, in order to inform him&s;elf from Mr. Lovelace's own mouth, whether he intends to do you That ju&s;tice or not.</P>
<P>He was extremely care&s;&s;ed by every one at his fir&s;t ar|rival; but I am told there is &s;ome little coldne&s;s between them and him at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I was in hopes of getting a &s;ight of this letter of Mr. Brand's (a ra&s;h, officious man!) But, it &s;eems, Mr. Mor|den had it given him ye&s;terday to read, and he took it away with him.</P>
<P>God be your comfort, my dear Mi&s;s! But indeed I am exceedingly di&s;turbed at the thoughts of what may &s;till be the i&s;&s;ue of all the&s;e things. I am,</P>

<P>AFTER I had &s;ealed up the inclo&s;ed, I had the ho|nour of a private vi&s;it from your aunt Hervey, who has been in a very low-&s;pirited way, and kept her chamber for &s;everal weeks pa&s;t; and is but ju&s;t got a|broad.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She pity'd very much your good mamma, who, &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, is obliged to act a part entirely contrary to her inclinations; as &s;he her&s;elf, &s;he owns, had been in a great mea&s;ure.</Q></P>

<P>THE relation of &s;uch a conver&s;ation as pa&s;&s;ed be|tween my aunt and you, would have given me plea&s;ure, had it come &s;ome time ago; becau&s;e it would have met with a &s;pirit more indu&s;trious than mine <HI>now</HI> is, to pick out remote comfort in the hope of a favourable turn that might one day have rewarded my patient duty.</P>
<P>I did not doubt my aunt's good-will to me. Her af|fection I did not doubt. But &s;hall we wonder that kings and princes meet with &s;o little controul in their pa&s;&s;ions, be they ever &s;o violent, when in a private family, an aunt, nay, even a mother in that family, &s;hall choo&s;e to give up a once favoured child again&s;t their own inclinations, rather than oppo&s;e an a&s;piring young man, who had armed him&s;elf with the authority of a father, who, when once determined, never would be expo&s;tulated with?</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">And will you not <HI>blame</HI> me, if I &s;ay, that good &s;en&s;e, that relationly indulgence, mu&s;t be a little offended at the treatment I have met with, and if I own, that I think, that great rigor has been exerci&s;ed towards me? And yet I am now authorized to call it <HI>rigor</HI> by the judgment of two excellent &s;i&s;ters, my mother and my aunt, who ac|knowlege, (as you tell me from my aunt) that they have been obliged to join again&s;t me, contrary to their inclina|tions; and that, even in a point which concerns my eter|nal welfare.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not go on at this rate. For may not the in|clination my mother has given up, be the effect of a too fond indulgence, rather than that I merit the indulgence? And yet, &s;o petulantly perver&s;e am I, that I mu&s;t tear my|&s;elf from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All then that I will &s;ay further to it, at this time, is, that were the intended goodne&s;s to be granted to me but a week hence; it would po&s;&s;ibly be too late&mdash;Too late, I mean, to be of the con&s;olation to me, that I would wi&s;h from it: For what an inefficacious preparation mu&s;t I have been making, if it has not, by this time, carried me a|bove&mdash;But above what?&mdash;Poor mi&s;taken creature!&mdash;Un|happy &s;elf-deluder!&mdash;that finds her&s;elf above nothing! Nor able to &s;ubdue her own faulty impatience!</P>
<P>But in <HI>deed</HI> to have done with a &s;ubject, that I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with; if it come in your way, let my aunt Hervey, let my dear cou&s;in Dolly, let the worthy Mrs. Williams, know, how exceedingly grateful to me their kind intentions and concern for me are: And, as the be&s;t warrant or ju&s;tification of their good opinions (&s;ince I know that their favour for me is founded on the belief that I loved virtue) tell them, that I <HI>continued</HI> to love virtue to my la&s;t hour, as I pre&s;ume to hope it may be &s;aid; and a&s;&s;ure them, that I never made the lea&s;t <HI>wilful</HI> deviation, how|ever unhappy I became for one faulty &s;tep; which never|thele&s;s was not owing to unworthy or perver&s;e motives.</P>
<P>I am very &s;orry, that my cou&s;in Morden has taken a re|&s;olution to &s;ee Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>My apprehen&s;ions on this intelligence, are a great abate|ment to the plea&s;ure I have in knowing that he &s;till loves me.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">My &s;i&s;ter's letter to me is a mo&s;t afflicting one&mdash;So <HI>need|le&s;ly,</HI> &s;o <HI>ludicrou&s;ly</HI> taunting.&mdash;But for that part of it that is &s;o, I ought rather to pity her, than to be &s;o much con|cerned at it as I am.</P>
<P>I wonder what I have done to Mr. Brand&mdash;I pray God to forgive both him and his informants, whoever they be. But if the &s;candal ari&s;e &s;olely from Mr. Belford's vi&s;its, a very little time will confute it.&mdash;Mean while, the pacquet I &s;hall &s;end you, which I &s;ent to Mi&s;s Howe, will, I hope, &s;atisfy <HI>you,</HI> my dear Mrs. Norton, as to my rea&s;ons for admitting his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter's taunting letter, and the inflexiblene&s;s of my dearer friends&mdash;But how do remoter-begun &s;ubjects tend to the point which lies neare&s;t the heart!&mdash;As new-caught bodily di&s;orders all croud to a fractured or di&s;tempered part.</P>
<P>I will break off, with reque&s;ting your prayers, that I may be ble&s;&s;ed with patience and due re&s;ignation; and with a&s;&s;uring you, that I am, and will be to the la&s;t hour of my life,</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read the letters and copies of letters you fa|voured me with: And I return them by a particular hand.</P>
<P>I am extremely concerned at your indifferent &s;tate of health: But I approve all your proceedings and precautions, in relation to the naming of a man for an office, that, I hope, will not require to be filled up for many, many years.</P>
<P>I admire, and &s;o we do all, that greatne&s;s of mind, which can make you &s;o &s;tedfa&s;tly de&s;pi&s;e (thro' &s;uch inducements as no other woman could re&s;i&s;t, and in &s;uch de&s;olate cir|cum&s;tances as you are in) the wretch that ought to be &s;o heartily de&s;pi&s;ed and dete&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">What mu&s;t the contents of tho&s;e letters from your re|lations be, which you will not communicate to me! Fie upon them! How my heart ri&s;es&mdash;But I dare &s;ay no more&mdash;Tho' you your&s;elf now begin to think they u&s;e you with great &s;everity.</P>
<P>Every body here is &s;o taken with Mr. Hickman, (and the more from the horror they conceive at the character of &s;uch a wretch as Lovelace) that I have been teazed to death almo&s;t, to name a day. This has given him airs; and, did I not keep him to it, he would behave him&s;elf as carele&s;ly, and as in&s;olently, as if he were &s;ure of me. I have been forced to mortify him no le&s;s than four times &s;ince we have been here.</P>
<P>I made him lately undergo a &s;evere penance for &s;ome negligences, that were not to be pa&s;&s;ed over: Not <HI>de&s;igned</HI> ones, he &s;aid: But that was a poor excu&s;e, as I told him: For, had they been <HI>de&s;igned,</HI> he &s;hould never have come into my pre&s;ence more: That they were <HI>not,</HI> &s;hewed his want of thought and attention; and tho&s;e were inexcu&s;e|able in a man only in his probatory &s;tate.</P>
<P>He hoped he had been more than in a <HI>probatory</HI> &s;tate, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>And therefore, Sir, might be more <HI>carele&s;s?</HI>&mdash;So you add <HI>ingratitude</HI> to <HI>negligence,</HI> and make what you plead as <HI>accident,</HI> that <HI>it&s;elf</HI> wants an excu&s;e, <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> which de|&s;erves none.</P>
<P>I would not &s;ee him for two days, and he was &s;o peni|tent, and &s;o humble, that I had like to have lo&s;t my&s;elf, to make him amends: For, as you have &s;aid, a re&s;entment carried too high, often ends in an amends too humble.</P>
<P>I long to be nearer to you: But that mu&s;t not yet be, it &s;eems. Pray, my dear, let me hear from you as often as you can.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, Aug.</HI> 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are very obliging, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, to ac|count to me for your &s;ilence. I was ea&s;y in it, as I doubted not, that among &s;uch near and dear friends as you are with, you was diverted from writing by &s;ome &s;uch agreeable excur&s;ion, as that you mention.</P>
<P>I was in hopes that you had given over, at this time of day, tho&s;e very &s;prightly airs, which I have taken the li|berty to blame you for, as often as you have given me oc|ca&s;ion for it; and that has been <HI>very</HI> often.</P>
<P>I was always very grave with you upon this &s;ubject: And while your own and a worthy man's future happine&s;s are in the que&s;tion, I mu&s;t enter into it, whenever you forget your&s;elf, altho' I had not a day to live: And in|deed I am very ill.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, it was not your intention to take your future hu&s;band with you to the little i&s;land, to make him look weak and &s;illy among tho&s;e of your relations who never before had &s;een him. Yet do you think it po&s;&s;ible for them (however prepared and re&s;olved they may be to like him) to forbear &s;miling at him when they &s;ee him &s;uffer|ing under your whim&s;ical penances? A mode&s;t man &s;hould no more be made little in <HI>his own eyes,</HI> than in the eyes of <HI>others.</HI> If he be, he will have a diffidence, which will give an aukwardne&s;s to every thing he &s;ays or does: And this will be no more to the credit of your choice, than to that of the approbation he meets with from your friends, or to his own credit.</P>
<P>I love an obliging, and even an <HI>humble</HI> deportment in a man to the woman he addre&s;&s;es. It is a mark of his po|litene&s;s, and tends to give her that opinion of her&s;elf, which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed ba&s;hful merit wants to be in|&s;pired with. But if the lady exacts it with a high hand, &s;he &s;hews not either her own politene&s;s or gratitude; altho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he does her courage. I gave you expecta|tion that I would be very &s;erious with you.</P>
<P>O my dear, that had it been my lot (as I was not per|mitted
<PB N="65" REF="66">
to live &s;ingle) to have met with a man by whom I could have acted generou&s;ly and unre&s;ervedly!</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, it is now plain, in order to have a pre|tence again&s;t me, taxed my behaviour to him, with &s;tif|ne&s;s and di&s;tance. You, at one time, thought me guilty of &s;ome degree of prudery. Difficult &s;ituations &s;hould be allowed for; which often make occa&s;ions for cen&s;ure un|avoidable. I de&s;erved not blame from <HI>him</HI> who made mine difficult. And you, my dear, if I had had any o|ther man to deal with, or had he had but half the merit which Mr. Hickman has, &s;hould have found that my doc|trine on this &s;ubject, &s;hould have governed my practice!</P>
<P>But to put my&s;elf out of the que&s;tion&mdash;I'll tell you what I &s;hould think, were I an indifferent by-&s;tander, of the&s;e high airs of yours, in return for Mr. Hickman's humble demeanour.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The lady thinks of having the gen|tleman, I &s;ee plainly, would I &s;ay. But I &s;ee, as plainly, that &s;he has a very great indifference to him. And to what may this indifference be owing? To one or all of the&s;e con&s;iderations, no doubt: That &s;he receives his addre&s;&s;es rather from motives of convenience than choice: That &s;he thinks meanly of <HI>his</HI> endowments and intellects; at lea&s;t more highly of <HI>her own:</HI> Or, &s;he has not the genero&s;ity to u&s;e that power with modera|tion, which his great affection for her puts into her hands."</Q></P>
<P>How would you like, my dear, to have any of the&s;e things &s;aid?</P>
<P>Then to give but the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on for free-livers and free-&s;peakers to &s;ay, or to imagine, that Mi&s;s Howe gives her hand to a man, who has no rea&s;on to expect any &s;hare in her heart, I am &s;ure you would not wi&s;h that &s;uch a thing &s;hould be &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;ed. Then, all the re|gard from you to come <HI>afterwards</HI>; none to be &s;hewn <HI>before</HI>; mu&s;t, I &s;hould think, be capable of being con|&s;trued, as a compliment to the <HI>hu&s;band,</HI> made at the ex|pence of the <HI>wife's delicacy.</HI></P>
<P>There is no fear that attempts could be formed by the mo&s;t audacious, [two Lovelaces there cannot be!] upon a character &s;o revered for virtue, and &s;o charmingly &s;pirited as Mi&s;s Howe's: Yet, to have any man encouraged to de&s;|pi&s;e

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day, Aug.</HI> 23.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Deare&s;t Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find renewed, at this di&s;tance of time, an addre&s;s &s;o po&s;itively tho' &s;o politely di&s;|couraged: But, however it be received, I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> renew it. Every body has heard, that you have been vilely treated by a man, who, to treat <HI>you</HI> ill, mu&s;t be the vile&s;t of men. Every body knows your ju&s;t re&s;entment of his ba&s;e treatment: That you are determined never to be reconciled to him: And that you per&s;i&s;t in the&s;e &s;entiments again&s;t all the in|treaties of his noble relations, again&s;t all the prayers and repentance of his ignoble &s;elf. And all the world that have the honour to know <HI>you,</HI> or have heard of <HI>him,</HI> applaud your re&s;olution, as worthy of your&s;elf; worthy of your virtue, and of that &s;trict honour which was always attributed to you by every one who &s;poke of you.</P>
<P>But, Madam, were all the world to have been of a dif|ferent opinion, it could never have altered mine. I ever loved you; I ever <HI>mu&s;t</HI> love you. Yet have I endeavoured to re&s;ign to my hard fate. When I had &s;o many ways, in vain, &s;ought to move you in my favour, I &s;at down, &s;eem|ingly contented. I even wrote to you, that I <HI>would</HI> &s;it down contented. And I endeavoured to make all my friends and companions think I was. But no body knows what pangs this &s;elf-denial co&s;t me! In vain did the chace, in vain did travel, in vain did lively company, offer them|&s;elves: Tho' embraced each in its turn, yet with redoubled force did my pa&s;&s;ion for you bring on my unhappine&s;s, when I looked into my&s;elf, into my own heart; for there did your charming image &s;it inthroned; and you ingro&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne all.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="71">I truly deplore tho&s;e misfortunes, and tho&s;e &s;ufferings, for your <HI>own</HI> &s;ake; which, neverthele&s;s, encourage <HI>me</HI> to renew my bold hope. I know not particulars. I dare not inquire after them; becau&s;e <HI>my</HI> &s;ufferings would be in|crea&s;ed with the knowlege of what <HI>yours</HI> have been. I therefore de&s;ire not to know more than what common re|port wounds my ears with; and what is given me to know, by your ab&s;ence from your cruel family, and from the &s;a|cred place, where I, among numbers of your rejected ad|mirers, u&s;ed to be twice a week &s;ure to behold you, doing credit to that &s;ervice, of which your example gave me the highe&s;t notions. But whatever be tho&s;e misfortunes, of what&s;oever nature tho&s;e &s;ufferings, I &s;hall ble&s;s the occa&s;ion for <HI>my own</HI> &s;ake, (tho' for <HI>yours</HI> cur&s;e the author of them) if they may give me the happine&s;s to know, that this my renewed addre&s;s may not be ab&s;olutely rejected. Only give me hope, that it may one day meet with encouragement, if in the interim nothing happen, either in my morals or behaviour, to give you fre&s;h offence. Give me but hope of this&mdash;Not ab&s;olutely to <HI>reject</HI> me is all the hope. I a&s;k for; and I will love you, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more than I ever loved you&mdash;And that for your &s;ufferings; for well you de|&s;erve to be loved, even to adoration, who can, for honour and for virtue's &s;ake, &s;ubdue a pa&s;&s;ion which common &s;pi|rits (I &s;peak by cruel experience) find invincible; and this at a time when the black offender kneels and &s;upplicates, as I am well a&s;&s;ured he does, (all his friends likewi&s;e &s;up|plicating for him) to be forgiven.</P>
<P>That you cannot forgive him; not forgive him &s;o as to receive him again to favour, is no wonder. His offence is again&s;t virtue: That is a part of your e&s;&s;ence&mdash;What magnanimity is this! How ju&s;t to your&s;elf, and to your &s;potle&s;s character! Is it any merit to admire more than ever &s;o exalted a di&s;tingui&s;her? It is not. I cannot plead it.</P>
<P>What hope have I left, may it be &s;aid, when my ad|dre&s;s was <HI>before</HI> rejected, now, that your &s;ufferings, &s;o <HI>nobly borne,</HI> have, with all <HI>good judges,</HI> exalted your cha|racter? Yet, Madam, I have to pride my&s;elf in this, That while your friends, (not looking upon you in the ju&s;t light I do) per&s;ecute and bani&s;h you; while your fortune and e&s;tate is with-held from you, and threatened (as I <HI>know</HI>)
<PB N="71" REF="72">
to be with-held, as long as the chicaning Law, or rather the chicaneriers of its practicers, can keep it from you: While you are de&s;titute of protection; every body &s;tanding aloof, either thro' fear of the injurer of one family, or of the hard-hearted of the other; I pride my&s;elf, I &s;ay, to &s;tand forth, and offer my fortune, and my life, at your devotion: With a <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> hope indeed: I &s;hould be too great an hypocrite not to own this: And I know how much you abhor in&s;incerity.</P>
<P>But, whether you encourage that hope or not, accept my be&s;t &s;ervices, I be&s;eech you, Madam: And be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e me for a piece of hone &s;tart, which the nature of the ca&s;e, (doubting the honour of your notice otherwi&s;e) makes me choo&s;e to conclude with&mdash;It is this:</P>
<P>If I am to be &s;till the mo&s;t unhappy of men, let your pen, by <HI>one line,</HI> tell me &s;o. If I am permitted to indulge a hope, however di&s;tant, your <HI>&s;ilence</HI> &s;hall be deemed by me, the happie&s;t indication of it that you can give&mdash;Ex|cept that <HI>&s;till</HI> happier&mdash;(the happie&s;t that <HI>can</HI> befal me) a &s;ignification that you will accept the tender of that life and fortune, which it would be my pride, and my glory, to &s;acrifice in your &s;ervice, leaving the reward to <HI>your&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Be your determination as it may, I mu&s;t for ever ad|mire and love you: Nor will I ever change my condition, while you live, whether you change yours or not: For, having once had the pre&s;umption to addre&s;s <HI>You,</HI> I cannot &s;toop to think of any other woman: And this I &s;olemnly declare in the pre&s;ence of that God, whom I daily pray to ble&s;s and protect you, be your determination what it will with regard to, deare&s;t Madam,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE genero&s;ity of your purpo&s;e would have com|manded not only my notice, but my thanks, altho' you had <HI>not</HI> given me the alternative you are plea&s;ed to
<PB N="72" REF="73">
call <HI>artful.</HI> And I do therefore give you my thanks for your kind letter.</P>
<P>At the time you di&s;tingui&s;hed me by your favourable opinion, I told you, Sir, that my choice was the &s;ingle life. And mo&s;t <HI>truly</HI> did I tell you &s;o.</P>
<P>When that was not permitted me, and I looked round upon the &s;everal gentlemen who had been propo&s;ed to me, and had rea&s;on to believe that there was not one of them again&s;t who&s;e morals or principles there lay not &s;ome ex|ception, it would not have been <HI>much</HI> to be wondered at, if FANCY <HI>had</HI> been allowed to give a preference, where JUDGMENT was at a lo&s;s to determine.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to &s;ay this with a de&s;ign to upbraid you, Sir, or to reflect upon you. I always wi&s;hed you well. You had rea&s;on to think I did. You had the genero&s;ity to be plea&s;ed with the frankne&s;s of my behaviour to you; as I had with that of yours to me: And I am &s;orry to be now told, that the acquie&s;cence you obliged me with, gave you &s;o much pain.</P>
<P>Had the option I have mentioned been allowed me <HI>af|terwards,</HI> (as I not only wi&s;hed but propo&s;ed) things had not happened that did happen. But there was a kind of fatality, by which our whole family was impelled, as I may &s;ay; and which none of us were permitted to avoid. But this is a &s;ubject that cannot be dwelt upon.</P>
<P>As matters are, I have only to wi&s;h, for your own &s;ake, that you will encourage and cultivate tho&s;e good motions in your mind, to which many pa&s;&s;ages in your kind and generous letter now before me, mu&s;t be owing. Depend upon it, Sir, that &s;uch motions wrought into habit, will yield you plea&s;ure at a <HI>time</HI> when nothing el&s;e can. And at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> &s;hining out in your actions and conver&s;ation, will commend you to the worthie&s;t of our Sex. For, Sir, the man who is good upon <HI>choice,</HI> as well as by <HI>education,</HI> has that quality in him&s;elf, which ennobles the human race, and without which the mo&s;t dignified by birth or rank are ignoble.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;olution you &s;o &s;olemnly make not to marry while I live, I &s;hould be concerned at it, were I not mo|rally &s;ure, that you may keep it, and yet not be detri|mented by it. Since a few, a very few days, will con|vince

<HEAD>LETTER XX. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>J. BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday noon, Aug.</HI> 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ABOUT the time of poor Belton's interrment la&s;t night, as near as we could gue&s;s, Lord M, Mowbray and my&s;elf toa&s;ted once, <HI>To the memory of hone&s;t Tom Belton</HI>; and, by a quick tran&s;ition to the living, <HI>Health to Mi&s;s Harlowe</HI>; which Lord M. obligingly began, and, <HI>To the happy reconciliation</HI>; and then we &s;tuck in a remembrance <HI>To hone&s;t Jack Belford,</HI> who, of late, we all agreed, was be|come an u&s;eful and humane man; preferring his friend's &s;ervice to his own.</P>
<P>But what is the meaning I hear nothing from thee, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. Belford had not yet &s;ent him his la&s;t-written letter. His rea&s;on for which &s;ee p. 44, 45.</NOTE>? And why do&s;t thou not let me into the grounds of the &s;udden reconciliation between my beloved and her friends, and the cau&s;e of the generous invitation which &s;he gives me of attending her at her father's &s;ome time hence?</P>
<P>Thou mu&s;t certainly have been let into the &s;ecret by this time; and I can tell thee, I &s;hall be plaguy jealous, if there be any one thing pa&s;s between my Angel and Thee, that is to be concealed from me. For either I am a prin|cipal in this cau&s;e, or I am nothing. I have di&s;patched Will. to know the rea&s;on of thy neglect.</P>
<P>But, let me whi&s;per a word or two in thy ear. I begin to be afraid, after all, that this letter was a &s;tratagem to get me out of town, and for nothing el&s;e: for, in the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t place, Tourville, in a letter I received this morning, tells me, that the lady is actually very ill&mdash;[I am &s;orry for it with all my &s;oul!] This, thou'lt &s;ay, I may think a rea&s;on, why &s;he cannot <HI>&s;et out as yet:</HI> But then, I have heard, on the other hand, but la&s;t night, that the family is as implacable as ever; and my Lord and I expect this very afternoon a vi&s;it from Colonel Morden; who undertakes,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
it &s;eems, to que&s;tion me as to my intention with regard to his cou&s;in.</P>
<P>This convinces me, that if &s;he <HI>has</HI> appri&s;ed them of my offers to her, they will not believe me to be in earne&s;t, till they are a&s;&s;ured that I am &s;o from my own mouth. And then I under&s;tand, that the intended vi&s;it is an officiou&s;ne&s;s of Morden's own, without the de&s;ire of any of her friends.</P>
<P>Now, Jack, what can a man make of all this? My in|telligence as to the continuance of her family's impla|cablene&s;s is not to be doubted; and yet when I read her letter, what can one &s;ay? Surely, the dear little rogue will not lie!</P>
<P>I never knew her di&s;pen&s;e with her word, but once: And that was, when &s;he promi&s;ed to forgive me, after the dread|ful fire that had like to have happened at our mother's, and yet would not &s;ee me next day, and afterwards made her e&s;cape to Ham&s;tead, in order to avoid forgiving me: And as &s;he &s;everely &s;marted for this departure from her ho|nour given (for it is a &s;ad thing for good people to break their word, when it is in their power to keep it) one would not expect, that &s;he &s;hould &s;et about deceiving again; more e&s;pecially by the <HI>premeditation of writing.</HI> You, perhaps, will a&s;k, What hone&s;t man is obliged to keep his promi&s;e with a highwayman? for well I know your unmannerly way of making compari&s;ons: But I &s;ay, <HI>every</HI> hone&s;t man is&mdash;And I will give you an illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>Here is a marauding varlet, who demands your money, with his pi&s;tol at your brea&s;t. You have neither money nor valuable effects about you; and promi&s;e &s;olemnly, if he will &s;pare your life, that you will &s;end him an agreed-upon &s;um, by &s;uch a day, to &s;uch a place. The que&s;tion is, If your life is not in the fellow's power?</P>
<P>How he came by the power is another que&s;tion; for which he mu&s;t an&s;wer with <HI>his</HI> life, when caught&mdash;&s;o he runs ri&s;que for ri&s;que.</P>
<P>Now if he gives you <HI>your life,</HI> does he not give, think you, a valuable con&s;ideration for the money you engage your honour to &s;end him? If not, the &s;um mu&s;t be exor|bitant, or your life is a very paltry one, even in your own opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="76">I need not make the application; and I am &s;ure, that even thou thy&s;elf, who never &s;pare&s;t me, and thinke&s;t thou knowe&s;t <HI>my</HI> heart by <HI>thy own,</HI> can&s;t not po&s;&s;ibly put the ca&s;e in a &s;tronger light again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Then, why do good people take upon them&s;elves to cen&s;ure, as they do, per&s;ons <HI>le&s;s</HI> &s;crupulous than them|&s;elves? Is it not becau&s;e the latter allow them&s;elves in <HI>any</HI> liberty, in order to carry a point? And can my not doing <HI>my</HI> duty, warrant another for not doing <HI>his?</HI> Thou wilt not &s;ay it can.</P>
<P>And how would it &s;ound, to put the ca&s;e as &s;trongly once more, as my greate&s;t enemy would put it, both as to <HI>fact</HI> and in <HI>words</HI>: Here has that profligate wretch Love|lace broken his vow with and deceived Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Har|lowe&mdash;A vile fellow! would an enemy &s;ay: But it is <HI>like</HI> him. But when it comes to be &s;aid, that the pious Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe has broken her word with and deceived Lovelace; Good Lord! would every one &s;ay! Sure it cannot be!</P>
<P>Upon my &s;oul, Jack, &s;uch is the veneration I have for this admirable woman, that I am &s;hocked barely at putting the ca&s;e; and &s;o wilt thou, if thou re&s;pecte&s;t her as thou oughte&s;t: For thou knowe&s;t, that men and women all the world over, form their opinions of one another, by each per&s;on's profe&s;&s;ions and known practices. In this lady therefore it would be as unpardonable to tell a wilful un|truth, as it would be &s;trange if I kept my word.&mdash;In Love|ca&s;es, I mean; for as to the re&s;t, I am an hone&s;t moral man, as all who know me can te&s;tify.</P>
<P>And what, after all, would this lady de&s;erve, if &s;he has deceived me in this ca&s;e? For did &s;he not &s;et me prancing away upon Lord M's be&s;t nag, to Lady Sarah's, and to Lady Betty's, with an erect and triumphing countenance, to &s;hew them her letter to me? And I have received their congratulations upon it: Well, and now, Cou&s;in Lovelace, cries one; Well and now, cou&s;in Lovelace, cries t'other; I hope you'll make the be&s;t of hu&s;bands to &s;o excellent and &s;o forgiving a lady! And now we &s;hall &s;oon have the plea|&s;ure of looking upon you as a reformed man, added one! And now we &s;hall &s;ee you in the way we have &s;o long wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed you to be in, exulted the other!</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">My cou&s;ins Montague al&s;o have been ever &s;ince rejoicing in the new relation&s;hip. Their charming cou&s;in, and their lovely cou&s;in, at every word!&mdash;And how dearly they will love her!&mdash;What le&s;&s;ons will they take from her!&mdash;And yet Charlotte, who pretends to have the eye of an eagle, was for finding out &s;ome my&s;tery in the &s;tyle and man|ner, till I overbore her, and laughed her out of it.</P>
<P>As for Lord M. he has been in hourly expectation of being &s;ent to with propo&s;als of one &s;ort or other from the Harlowes: And &s;till will have it, that &s;uch propo&s;als will be made by Colonel Morden when he comes; and that the Harlowes only put on a face of irreconcileablene&s;s, till they know the i&s;&s;ue of Morden's vi&s;it, in order to make the better terms with us.</P>
<P>Indeed, if I had not undoubted rea&s;on, as I &s;aid, to be|lieve the continuance of their antipathy to <HI>me,</HI> and im|placablene&s;s to <HI>her,</HI> I &s;hould be apt to think there might be &s;ome foundation for my Lord's conjecture; for there is a cur&s;ed deal of low cunning in all that family, except in the angel of it, who has &s;o much genero&s;ity of &s;oul, that &s;he de&s;pi&s;es cunning, both name and thing.</P>
<P>What I mean by all This, is, to let thee &s;ee, what a &s;tupid figure I &s;hould make to all my own family, if my Clari&s;&s;a has been capable, as Gulliver in his abominable Yahoo-&s;tory phra&s;es it, of &s;aying the <HI>thing that is not.</HI> By my &s;oul, Jack, if it were only that I &s;hould be <HI>outwitted</HI> by &s;uch a novice at plotting, and that it would make me look &s;illy to my kin&s;women here, who know I value my|&s;elf upon my contrivances, it would vex me to the heart; and I would in&s;tantly clap a feather-bed into a coach and fix, and fetch her away, &s;ick or well, and marry her at my lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>But Col. Morden is come, and I mu&s;t break off.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday Night, Aug.</HI> 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Doubt you will be all impatience, that you have not heard from me &s;ince mine of Thur&s;day la&s;t. You would be &s;till more &s;o, if you knew that I had by me a letter ready-written.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">I went early ye&s;terday morning to Ep&s;om; and found every thing di&s;po&s;ed according to the directions I had left on Friday; and at night the &s;olemn office was performed. Tourville was there; and behaved very decently, and with greater concern than I thought he would ever have expre&s;&s;ed for any body.</P>
<P>Thoma&s;ine, they told me, in a kind of di&s;gui&s;e, was in an ob&s;cure pew, out of curio&s;ity (for it &s;eems &s;he was far from &s;hewing any tokens of grief) to &s;ee the la&s;t office performed for the man who&s;e heart &s;he had &s;o largely con|tributed to break.</P>
<P>I was obliged to &s;tay till this afternoon, to &s;ettle &s;everal nece&s;&s;ary matters, and to direct inventories to be taken, in order for apprai&s;ement; for every thing is to be turned into money, by his will. I pre&s;ented his &s;i&s;ter with the 100 guineas the poor man left me as his executor, and de&s;ired her to continue in the hou&s;e, and take the direction of every thing, till I could hear from his nephew at An|tigua, who is <HI>heir at law.</HI> He had left her but 50 <HI>l.</HI> altho' he knew her indigence; and that it was owing to a vile hu&s;band, and not to her&s;elf, that &s;he <HI>was</HI> indigent.</P>
<P>The poor man left about 200<HI>l.</HI> in money, and 200 <HI>l.</HI> in two Ea&s;t-India bonds; and I will contrive, if I can, to make up the poor woman's 50<HI>l.</HI> and my 100 guineas, 200<HI>l.</HI> to her; and then &s;he will have &s;ome little matter coming in certain, which I will oblige her to keep out of the hands of a &s;on, who has compleated that ruin which his father had very near effected.</P>
<P>I gave Tourville his 20<HI>l.</HI> and will &s;end you and Mow|bray yours by the fir&s;t order. And &s;o much for poor Bel|ton's affairs till I &s;ee you.</P>
<P>I got to town in the evening, and went directly to Smith's. I found Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith in the back-&s;hop, and I &s;aw they had been both in tears. They rejoiced to &s;ee me, however, and told me, that the doctor and Mr. Goddard were but ju&s;t gone; as was al&s;o the worthy clergyman, who often comes to pray by her; and all three were of opinion, that &s;he would hardly live to &s;ee the entrance of another week. I was not &s;o much &s;ur|pri&s;ed as grieved; for I had feared as much when I left her on Saturday.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">I &s;ent up my compliments; and &s;he returned, that &s;he would take it for a favour if I would call upon her in the morning, by eight o'clock. Mrs. Lovick told me, That &s;he had fainted away on Saturday, while &s;he was writing, as &s;he had done likewi&s;e the day before; and having re|ceived benefit then by a little turn in a chair, &s;he was car|ried abroad again. She returned &s;omewhat better; and wrote till late; yet had a pretty good night; and went to Covent-garden church in the morning: But came home &s;o ill, that &s;he was obliged to lie down.</P>
<P>When &s;he aro&s;e, &s;eeing how much grieved Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith were for her, &s;he made apologies for the trouble &s;he gave them&mdash;You were happy, &s;aid &s;he, before I came hither. It was a cruel thing in me to come among hone&s;t &s;trangers, and to be &s;ick, and die with you.</P>
<P>When they touched upon the irreconcileablene&s;s of her friends, &s;he &s;aid, She had ill offices done her to them, and they did not know how ill &s;he was, nor would they be|lieve any thing &s;he &s;hould write. But yet &s;he could not but &s;ometimes think it a little hard, that &s;he &s;hould have &s;o many near and dear friends living, and not one to look upon her&mdash;No old &s;ervant, no old friend, &s;he &s;aid, to be permitted to come near her, without being &s;ure of in|curring di&s;plea&s;ure; and to have &s;uch a great work to go thro' by her&s;elf, a young creature as &s;he was, and to have every thing to think of as to her temporal matters, and to order, to her very interrment! No dear mother, &s;aid &s;he, to pray by me and ble&s;s me!&mdash;No kind &s;i&s;ter to &s;ooth and comfort me!&mdash;But come, &s;aid &s;he, how do I know but all is for the be&s;t&mdash;If I can but make a right u&s;e of the di&s;|pen&s;ation?&mdash;Pray for me, Mrs. Lovick&mdash;Pray for me, Mrs. Smith, that I may&mdash;I have great need of your prayers.&mdash;This cruel man has di&s;compo&s;ed me. His per&s;ecutions have given me a pain ju&s;t here&mdash;putting her hand to her heart. What a &s;tep has he made me take to avoid him!&mdash;Who can <HI>touch pitch, and not be defiled?</HI> He has made a bad &s;pirit take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, I think&mdash;Broken in upon all my duties. And will not yet, I doubt, let me be at re&s;t. Indeed he is very cruel.&mdash;But, this is one of my trials, I believe. By God's grace I &s;hall be ea&s;ier to-morrow, and e&s;pecially if I have no more of his tormentings, and if I can can get a tolerable night. And I will &s;it up till eleven, that I may.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="80">She &s;aid, That tho' this was &s;o heavy a day with her, &s;he was at other times, within the&s;e few days pa&s;t e&s;peci|ally, ble&s;&s;ed with bright hours; and particularly, that &s;he had now-and-then &s;uch joyful a&s;&s;urances (which &s;he hoped were not pre&s;umptuous ones) that God would re|ceive her to his mercy, that &s;he could hardly contain her|&s;elf, and was ready to think her&s;elf above this earth while &s;he was in it: And what, inferred &s;he to Mrs. Lovick, mu&s;t be the &s;tate it&s;elf, the very a&s;pirations after which, have often ca&s;t a beamy light thro' the thicke&s;t darkne&s;s, and when I have been at the lowe&s;t ebb, have di&s;pelled the black clouds of de&s;pondency?&mdash;As I hope they &s;oon will this &s;pirit of repining.</P>
<P>She had a pretty good night, it &s;eems, and this morning went in a chair to St. Dun&s;tan's church.</P>
<P>The chairmen told Mrs. Smith, that after prayers (for &s;he did not return till between nine and ten) they carried her to a hou&s;e in Fleet-&s;treet, where they never waited on her before. And where do&s;t think this was?&mdash;Why, to an Undertaker's! Good God! what a woman is this! She went into the back-&s;hop, and talked with the ma&s;ter of it about half an hour, and came from him with great &s;ere|nity; he waiting upon her to her chair with a re&s;pectful countenance, but full of curio&s;ity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, that &s;he then went to be&s;peak her <HI>hou&s;e</HI> that &s;he talked of <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 44.</NOTE>.&mdash;<HI>As &s;oon as you can, Sir,</HI> were her words to him as &s;he got into the chair. Mrs. Smith told me this with the &s;ame &s;urprize, and grief, that I heard it.</P>
<P>She was &s;o ill in the afternoon, having got cold either at St. Dun&s;tan's or at chapel, that &s;he &s;ent for the clergy|man to pray by her; and the women, unknown to her, &s;ent both for Dr. H. and Mr. Goddard: Who were ju&s;t gone, as I told you, when I came to pay my re&s;pects to her this evening.</P>
<P>And thus I have recounted from the good women what pa&s;&s;ed to this night &s;ince my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I long for to-morrow, that I may &s;ee her: And yet 'tis &s;uch a melancholy longing, as I never experienced, and know not how to de&s;cribe.</P>

<P>I WAS at Smith's at half an hour after &s;even. They
<PB N="80" REF="81">
told me, that the lady was gone in a chair to St. Dun|&s;tan's; but was better than &s;he had been in either of the two preceding days; and &s;aid to Mrs Lovick and Mrs. Smith, as &s;he went into the chair, I have a good deal to an&s;wer for to you, my good friends, for my vapouri&s;h conver&s;ation of la&s;t night.</P>
<P>If, Mrs. Lovick, &s;aid &s;he &s;miling, I have no new mat|ters to di&s;compo&s;e me, I believe my &s;pirits will hold out purely.</P>
<P>She returned immediately after prayers.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he entered the back-&s;hop where I was, and upon my approaching her, I am very glad to &s;ee you. You have been performing for your poor friend a kind la&s;t office. 'Tis not long ago, &s;ince you did the &s;ame for a near relation. Is it not a little hard upon you, that the&s;e troubles &s;hould fall &s;o thick to your lot? But they are charitable offices: And it is a prai&s;e to your humanity, that poor dying people know not where to choo&s;e &s;o well.</P>
<P>I told her I was &s;orry to hear &s;he had been &s;o ill &s;ince I had the honour to attend her; but rejoiced to find, that now &s;he &s;eemed a good deal better.</P>
<P>It will be &s;ometimes better, and &s;ometimes wor&s;e, re|plied &s;he, with poor creatures, when they are balancing between life and death. But no more of the&s;e matters ju&s;t now. I hope, Sir, you'll breakfa&s;t with me. I was quite vapouri&s;h ye&s;terday. I had a very bad &s;pirit upon me, Had I not, Mrs. Smith? But I hope I &s;hall be no more &s;o. And to-day I am perfectly &s;erene. This day ri&s;es upon me as if it would be a bright one.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired me to walk up, and invited Mr. Smith and his wife, and Mrs. Lovick al&s;o, to breakfa&s;t with her. I was better plea&s;ed with her liveline&s;s than with her looks.</P>
<P>The good people retiring after breakfa&s;t, the following conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between us.</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, let me a&s;k you, &s;aid &s;he, if you think I may promi&s;e my&s;elf that I &s;hall be no more mole&s;ted by your friend?</P>
<P>I he&s;itated: For how could I an&s;wer for &s;uch a man?</P>
<P>What &s;hall I do, if he comes again?&mdash;You &s;ee how I am.&mdash;I cannot fly from him now&mdash;If he has any pity left for the poor creature whom he has thus reduced, let him
<PB N="81" REF="82">
not come.&mdash;But have you heard from him lately? And will he come?</P>
<P>I hope not, Madam; I have not heard from him &s;ince Thur&s;day la&s;t, that he went out of town, rejoicing in the hopes your letter gave him of a reconciliation between your friends and you, and that he might in good time &s;ee you at your father's; and he is gone down to give all his friends joy of the news, and is in high &s;pirits upon it.</P>
<P>Alas for me! I &s;hall then &s;urely have him come up to per&s;ecute me again! As &s;oon as he di&s;covers that That was only a &s;tratagem to keep him away, he will come up; and who knows but even <HI>now</HI> he is upon the road? I thought I was &s;o bad, that I &s;hould have been out of his and every body's way before now; for I expected not, that this con|trivance would &s;erve me above two or three days; and by this time he mu&s;t have found out, that I am not &s;o happy as to have any hope of a reconciliation with my family; and then he will come, if it be only in revenge for what he will think a deceit.</P>
<P>I believe I looked &s;urpri&s;ed to hear her confe&s;s that her letter was a &s;tratagem only; for &s;he &s;aid, You wonder, Mr. Belford, I ob&s;erve, that I could be guilty of &s;uch an artifice. I doubt it is not right: But how could I &s;ee a man who had &s;o mortally injured me; yet, pretending &s;orrow for his crimes, and wanting to &s;ee me, could behave with &s;o much &s;hocking levity, as he did to the hone&s;t people of the hou&s;e? Yet, 'tis &s;trange too, that neither you nor he found out my meaning on peru&s;al of my letter. You have &s;een what I wrote, no doubt?</P>
<P>I have, Madam. And then I began to account for it, as an <HI>innocent</HI> artifice.</P>
<P>Thus far indeed, Sir, it is <HI>innocent,</HI> that I meant him no hurt, and had a right to the effect I hoped for from it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and he had none to invade me. But have you, Sir, that letter of his, in which he gives you (as I &s;uppo&s;e he does) the copy of mine?</P>
<P>I have, Madam. And pulled it out of my letter-ca&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: But he&s;itating&mdash;Nay, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, be plea&s;ed to read my letter to your&s;elf&mdash;I de&s;ire not to &s;ee <HI>his</HI>&mdash;and &s;ee if you can be longer a &s;tranger to a meaning &s;o obvious.</P>
<P>I read it to my&s;elf&mdash;Indeed, Madam, I can find nothing but that you are going down to Harlowe-place to be re|conciled
<PB N="82" REF="83">
to your father and other friends: And Mr. Love|lace pre&s;umed that a letter from your &s;i&s;ter, which he &s;aw brought when he was at Mr. Smith's, gave you the wel|come news of it.</P>
<P>She then explained all to me, and that, as I may &s;ay, in &s;ix words&mdash;A <HI>religious</HI> meaning is couched under it, and that's the rea&s;on that neither you nor I could find it out.</P>
<P>Read but for my <HI>father's hou&s;e, Heaven,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, and for the interpo&s;ition of my dear ble&s;&s;ed friend, &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Mediation</HI> of my <HI>Saviour</HI>; which I humbly rely upon; and all the re&s;t of the letter will be accounted for.</P>
<P>I read it &s;o, and &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed for a minute at her in|vention, her piety, her charity, and at thine and my own &s;tupidity, to be thus taken in.</P>
<P>And now, thou vile Lovelace, what ha&s;t thou to do, (the lady all con&s;i&s;tent with her&s;elf, and no hopes left for thee) but to hang, drown, or &s;hoot thy&s;elf, for an out|witted triumpher?</P>
<P>My &s;urprize being a little over, &s;he proceeded: As to the letter that came from my &s;i&s;ter while your friend was here, you will <HI>&s;oon</HI> &s;ee, Sir, that it is the cruele&s;t letter &s;he ever wrote me.</P>
<P>And then &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a deep concern for what might be the con&s;equence of Col. Morden's intended vi&s;it to you; and be&s;ought me, that if now, or at any time hereafter, I had opportunity to prevent any further mi&s;chief, without detriment or danger to my&s;elf, I would do it.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her of the mo&s;t particular attention to this and to all her commands; and that in a manner &s;o agree|able to her, that &s;he invoked a ble&s;&s;ing upon me for my goodne&s;s, as &s;he called it, to a de&s;olate creature who &s;uf|fered under the wor&s;t of orphanage; tho&s;e were her words.</P>
<P>She then went back to her fir&s;t &s;ubject, her unea&s;ine&s;s for fear of your mole&s;ting her again; and &s;aid, If you have any influence over him, Mr. Belford, prevail upon him, that he will give me the a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;hort remain|der of my time &s;hall be all my own. I have need of it. Indeed I have&punc; Why will he wi&s;h to interrupt me in my duty? Has he not puni&s;hed me enough for my preference of him to all his &s;ex? Has he not de&s;troyed my &s;ame and my fortune? And will not his cau&s;ele&s;s vengeance upon
<PB N="83" REF="84">
me be complete, unle&s;s he ruins my &s;oul too?&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir, this vehemence! But indeed it greatly imports me, to know that I &s;hall be no more di&s;turbed by him. And yet, with all this aver&s;ion, I would &s;ooner give way to his vi&s;it, tho' I were to expire the moment I &s;aw him, than to be the cau&s;e of any fatal mi&s;under&s;tanding between you and him.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured her, that I would make &s;uch a repre&s;entation of the matter to you, and of the &s;tate of her health, that I would undertake to <HI>an&s;wer for you,</HI> that you would not attempt to come near her.</P>
<P>And for this rea&s;on, Lovelace, do I lay the whole mat|ter before you, and de&s;ire you will authorize me, as &s;oon as this and mine of Saturday la&s;t come to your hands, to di&s;&s;ipate her fears.</P>
<P>This gave her a little &s;atisfaction; and then &s;he &s;aid, that had I not told her I <HI>could</HI> promi&s;e for you, &s;he was de|termined, ill as &s;he is, to remove &s;omewhere out of my knowlege as well as out of yours. And yet, to have been obliged to leave people I am but ju&s;t got acquainted with, &s;aid the poor lady, and to have died among perfect &s;tran|gers, would have completed my hard&s;hips.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, I found, as well from the length, as the nature of it, had fatigued her; and &s;eeing her change colour once or twice, I made that my excu&s;e, and took leave of her: De&s;iring her permi&s;&s;ion to attend her in the evening; and as often as po&s;&s;ible; for I could not help telling her, that every time I &s;aw her, I more and more con&s;idered her as a beatified &s;pirit; and as one &s;ent from heaven to draw me after her out of the miry gulph in which I had been &s;o long immer&s;ed.</P>
<P>And laugh at me, if thou wilt; but it is true, that every time I approach her, I cannot but look upon her, as one ju&s;t entering into a companion&s;hip with &s;aints and angels. This thought &s;o wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me, that I could not help begging, as I went away, her prayers and her ble&s;&s;ing; and that with the reverence due to an angel, and with an earne&s;tne&s;s like That, which expecting intimates manife&s;t, when they &s;eek to make an intere&s;t with a per&s;on, who is ju&s;t exalted into a prime degree of power, by the favour of his prince.</P>
<P>In the evening, &s;he was &s;o low and weak, that I took
<PB N="84" REF="85">
my leave of her, in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour. I went directly home. Where, to the plea&s;ure and wonder of my cou&s;in and her family, I now pa&s;s many hone&s;t evenings: Which they impute to your being out of town.</P>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;patch my packet to-morrow morning early by my own &s;ervant, to make you amends for the &s;u&s;pence I mu&s;t have kept you in: You'll thank me for that, I hope; but will not, I am &s;ure, for &s;ending your &s;ervant back without a letter.</P>
<P>I long for the particulars of the conver&s;ation between you and Mr. Morden: The lady, as I have hinted, is full of apprehen&s;ions about it. Send me back this packet when peru&s;ed, for I have not had either time or patience to take a copy of it.&mdash;And I be&s;eech you enable me to make good my engagements to the poor lady that you will not in|vade her again.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. Mr. <HI>BELFORD,</HI> To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day, Aug.</HI> 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE a conver&s;ation to give you that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween this admirable lady and Dr. H. which will fur|ni&s;h a new in&s;tance of the calmne&s;s and &s;erenity with which &s;he can talk of death, and prepare for it, as if it were an occurrence as familiar to her as dre&s;&s;ing and un|dre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had di&s;patched my &s;ervant to you with my letters of the 26th, 28th, and ye&s;terday the 29th, I went to pay my duty to her, and had the plea&s;ure to find her, after a tolerable night, pretty lively and chearful. She was but ju&s;t returned from her u&s;ual devotions. And Doctor H. alighted as &s;he entered the door.</P>
<P>After enquiring how &s;he did, and hearing her com|plaints of &s;hortne&s;s of breath (which &s;he attributed to inward decay, precipitated by her late hara&s;&s;es, as well from her friends as from you) he was for advi&s;ing her to go into the air.</P>
<P>What will that do for me, &s;aid &s;he? Tell me truly, good Sir, with a chearful a&s;pect, (you know you cannot di&s;turb me by it) whether now you do not put on the <HI>true</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="86">
phy&s;ician; and, de&s;pairing that any thing in medicine will help me, advi&s;e me to the air, as the la&s;t re&s;ource?&mdash;Can you think the air will avail in &s;uch a malady as mine?</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, &s;aid &s;he, becau&s;e my friends (who will po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome time hence inquire after the means I u&s;ed for my re|covery) may be &s;atisfied that I omitted nothing which &s;o worthy and &s;o &s;kilful a phy&s;ician pre&s;cribed?</P>
<P>The air, Madam, may po&s;&s;ibly help the difficulty of breathing, which has &s;o lately attacked you.</P>
<P>But, Sir, you &s;ee how weak I am. You mu&s;t &s;ee that I have been con&s;uming from day to day; and now, if I can judge by what I feel in my&s;elf, putting her hand to her heart, I cannot continue long. If the air would <HI>very</HI> probably add to my days, tho' I am far from being <HI>de|&s;irous</HI> to have them lengthened, I would go into it; and the rather, as I know Mrs. Lovick would kindly accom|pany me. But if I were to be at the trouble of remov|ing into new lodgings (a trouble which I think now would be too much for me) and this only to <HI>die</HI> in the country, I had rather the &s;cene were to be &s;hut up here. For here have I meditated the &s;pot, and the manner, and every thing, as well of the minute&s;t as of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, that can attend the &s;olemn moments. So, Doctor, tell me truly, May I &s;tay here, and be clear of any imputations of curtailing, thro' wilfulne&s;s or impatiency, or thro' re&s;entments which I hope I am got above, a life that might otherwi&s;e be prolonged?&mdash;Tell me, Sir, you are not talking to a coward in this re&s;pect; indeed you are not!&mdash;Unaffectedly &s;miling.</P>
<P>The doctor turning to me, was at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay, lifting up his eyes only in admiration of her.</P>
<P>Never had any patient, &s;aid &s;he, a more indulgent and more humane phy&s;ician&mdash;But &s;ince you are loth to an&s;wer my que&s;tion directly, I will put it in other words. You don't <HI>injoin</HI> me to go into the air, Doctor, do you?</P>
<P>I do <HI>not,</HI> Madam. Nor do I now vi&s;it you as a phy&s;i|cian; but as a per&s;on who&s;e conver&s;ation I admire, and who&s;e &s;ufferings I condole. And to explain my&s;elf more directly, as to the occa&s;ion of this day's vi&s;it in particular, I mu&s;t tell you, Madam, that, under&s;tanding how much
<PB N="86" REF="87">
you &s;uffer by the di&s;plea&s;ure of your friends; and having no doubt, but that if they knew the way you are in, they would alter their conduct to you; and believing it mu&s;t cut them to the heart, when too late they &s;hall be informed of everything; I have re&s;olved to appri&s;e them by letter (&s;tran|ger as I am to their per&s;ons) how nece&s;&s;ary it is for &s;ome of them to attend you very &s;peedily. For <HI>their</HI> &s;akes, Madam, let me pre&s;s for your approbation of this mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, and at la&s;t &s;aid, This is kind, very kind, in you, Sir. But I hope that you do not think me &s;o per|ver&s;e, and &s;o ob&s;tinate, as to have left till now any means une&s;&s;ayed, which I thought likely to move my friends in my favour. But now, Doctor, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hould be too much di&s;turbed at their grief, if they were any of them to come or to &s;end to me: And, perhaps, if I found they &s;till loved me, wi&s;h to live; and &s;o &s;hould quit unwil|lingly that life, which I am now really fond of quitting, and hope to quit, as becomes a per&s;on who has had &s;uch a weaning-time as I have been favoured with.</P>
<P>I hope, Madam, &s;aid I, we are not &s;o near as you ap|prehend, to that deplorable deprivation you hint at with &s;uch an amazing pre&s;ence of mind. And therefore I pre&s;ume to &s;econd the doctor's motion, if it were only for the &s;ake of your father and mother, that they may have the &s;atisfaction, if they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> lo&s;e you, to think, they were fir&s;t reconciled to you.</P>
<P>It is very kindly, very humanely con&s;idered, &s;aid &s;he. But, if you think me not &s;o <HI>very</HI> near my la&s;t hour; let me de&s;ire this may be po&s;tponed till I &s;ee what effect my cou&s;in Morden's mediation may have. Perhaps he may vouch&s;afe to make me a vi&s;it yet, after his intended inter|view with Mr. Lovelace is over; of which, who knows, Mr. Belford, but your next letters may give an account? I hope it will not be a fatal one to <HI>any</HI> body!&mdash;Will you promi&s;e me, Doctor, to forbear writing for two days only, and I will communicate to you any thing that occurs in that time; and then you &s;hall take your own way? Mean time, I repeat my thanks for your goodne&s;s to me.&mdash;Nay, dear Doctor, hurry not away from me &s;o precipitately (for he was going for fear of an offered fee) I will no more affront you with tenders that have pained you for &s;ome time pa&s;t:
<PB N="87" REF="88">
And &s;ince I mu&s;t now, from this kindly offered favour, look upon you only as a friend, I will a&s;&s;ure you hence|forth, that I will give you no more unea&s;ine&s;s on that head: And now, Sir, I know I &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you oftener than heretofore.</P>
<P>The worthy gentleman was plea&s;ed with this a&s;&s;urance, telling her, that he had always come to &s;ee her with great plea&s;ure, but parted with her, on the account &s;he hinted at, with as much pain; and that he &s;hould not have forborn to double his vi&s;its, could he have had this kind a&s;&s;urance as early as he wi&s;hed for it.</P>
<P>There are few in&s;tances of like di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, I doubt, in this tribe. Till now I always held it for go&s;pel, That <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> and <HI>phy&s;ician</HI> were incompatible things; and little imagined, that a man of medicine, when he had given over his patient to death, would think of any vi&s;its but tho&s;e of ceremony, that he might &s;tand well with the family, again&s;t it came to their turns to go thro' his turnpike.</P>
<P>After the Doctor was gone, &s;he fell into a very &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e of the vanity of life, and the wi&s;dom of prepar|ing for death, while health and &s;trength remained, and be|fore the infirmities of body impaired the faculties of the mind, and di&s;abled them from acting with the nece&s;&s;ary efficacy and clearne&s;s: The whole calculated for every|one's meridian, but particularly, as it was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, for Thine and Mine.</P>
<P>She was very curious to know further particulars of the behaviour of poor Belton in his la&s;t moments. You mu&s;t not wonder at my inquiries, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he; for who is it that is to undertake a journey into a country they never travelled to before, that inquires not into the difficulties of the road, and what accommodations are to be expected in the way?</P>
<P>I gave her a brief account of the poor man's terrors, and unwillingne&s;s to die: And when I had done; Thus, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he, mu&s;t it always be, with poor &s;ouls who have never thought of their long voyage till the mo|ment they are to imbark for it.</P>
<P>She made &s;uch other ob&s;ervations upon this &s;ubject, as coming from the mouth of a per&s;on who will &s;o &s;oon be a companion for angels, I &s;hall never forget. And indeed,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
when I went home, that I might ingraft them the better on my memory, I entered them down in writing: But I will not let you &s;ee them until you are in a frame more proper to benefit by them, than you are likely to be in one while.</P>
<P>Thus far I had written, when the unexpected early return of my &s;ervant with your packet (yours and he meeting at Slough, and exchanging letters) obliged me to leave off to give its contents a reading.&mdash;Here, therefore, I clo&s;e this letter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day morn. Aug.</HI> 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOW, Jack, will I give thee an account of what pa&s;&s;ed on occa&s;ion of the vi&s;it made us by Col. Morden.</P>
<P>He came on hor&s;eback, attended by one &s;ervant; and Lord M. received him as a relation of Mi&s;s Harlowe's, with the highe&s;t marks of civility and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>After &s;ome general talk of the times, and of the weather, and &s;uch non&s;en&s;e as Engli&s;hmen generally make their in|troductory topics to conver&s;ation, the Colonel addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Lord M. and to me, as follows:</P>
<P>I need not, my Lord, and Mr. Lovelace, as you know the relation I bear to the Harlowe family, make any apo|logy for entering upon a &s;ubject, which, on account of that relation, you mu&s;t think is the principal rea&s;on of the honour I have done my&s;elf in this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harlowe, Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe's affair, &s;aid Lord M. with his u&s;ual forward bluntne&s;s. That, Sir, is what you mean. She is, by all accounts, the mo&s;t ex|cellent woman in the world.</P>
<P>I am glad to hear that is your Lord&s;hip's opinion of her. It is every one's.</P>
<P>It is not only my opinion, Col. Morden (proceeded the prateing peer) but it is the opinion of all my family. Of my &s;i&s;ters, of my nieces, and of Mr. Lovelace him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Would to heaven it had been always Mr. Love|lace's opinion of her!</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> You have been out of England, Colonel, a good
<PB N="89" REF="90">
many years. Perhaps you are not yet fully appri&s;ed of all the particulars of this ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I have been out of England, Sir, about &s;even years. My cou&s;in Clary Harlowe was then about <HI>twelve</HI> years of age: But never was there at <HI>twenty</HI> &s;o di&s;creet, &s;o pru|dent, and &s;o excellent a creature. All that knew her, or &s;aw her, admired her. Mind and per&s;on, never did I &s;ee &s;uch promi&s;es of perfection in any young lady: And I am told, nor is it to be wondered at, that as &s;he advanced to maturity, &s;he more than ju&s;tified and made good tho&s;e promi&s;es.&mdash;Then, as to fortune&mdash;what her father, what her uncles, and what I my&s;elf intended to do for her, be&s;ides what her grandfather had done&mdash;There is not a finer fortune in the county.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> All this, Colonel, and more than this, is Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe; and had it not been for the implacable|ne&s;s and violence of her family, (all re&s;olved to pu&s;h her upon a match as unworthy <HI>of</HI> her, as hateful <HI>to</HI> her) &s;he had &s;till been happy.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I own, Mr. Lovelace, the truth of what you ob|&s;erved ju&s;t now, that I am not thoroughly acquainted with all that has pa&s;&s;ed between you and my cou&s;in. But per|mit me to &s;ay, that when I fir&s;t heard that you made your addre&s;&s;es to her, I knew but of one objection again&s;t you. That, indeed, a very great one: And upon a letter &s;ent me, I gave her my free opinion upon the &s;ubject <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. III. P. 356.</NOTE>. But had it not been for that, I own, that in my private mind, there could not have been a more &s;uitable match: For you are a gallant gentleman, graceful in your per&s;on, ea&s;y and genteel in your deportment, and in your family, fortunes, and expectations happy as a man can wi&s;h to be. Then the knowlege I had of you in Italy (altho' give me leave to &s;ay, your conduct there was not wholly unexception|able) convinces me, that you are brave: And few gentle|men come up to you in wit and vivacity. Your educa|tion has given you great advantages; your manners are en|gaging, and you have travelled; and I know, if you'll excu&s;e me, you make better ob&s;ervations than you are go|verned by. All the&s;e qualifications make it not at all &s;urpri|&s;ing, that a young lady &s;hould love you: And that this love,
<PB N="90" REF="91">
joined to that indi&s;creet warmth wherewith my cou&s;in's friends would have forced her inclinations in favour of men who are far your inferiors in the qualities I have named, &s;hould throw her upon your protection: But then, if there were the&s;e two &s;trong motives, the one to <HI>induce,</HI> the other to <HI>impel</HI> her, let me a&s;k you, Sir, If &s;he were not doubly intitled to generous u&s;age from a man whom &s;he cho&s;e for her protector; and whom, let me take the liberty to &s;ay, &s;he could &s;o amply reward for the protection he was to afford her?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe was intitled, Sir, to the be&s;t u&s;age that man could give her. I have no &s;cruple to own it. I will always do her the ju&s;tice &s;he &s;o well de|&s;erves. I know what will be your inference; and have only to &s;ay, That time pa&s;t cannot be recalled. Perhaps I wi&s;h it could.</P>
<P>The Colonel then in a very manly &s;train &s;et forth the wickedne&s;s of attempting a woman of virtue, and cha|racter. He &s;aid, that men had generally too many advan|tages over the weakne&s;s, credulity, and inexperience of the fair &s;ex, who were too apt to be hurried into acts of precipitation by their reading inflaming novels, and idle romances; that his cou&s;in, however, he was &s;ure, was above the reach of common &s;eduction, or to be influenced to the ra&s;hne&s;s her parents accu&s;ed her of, by weaker mo|tives than <HI>their</HI> violence, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es on <HI>my part:</HI> But, neverthele&s;s, <HI>having</HI> tho&s;e motives, and her prudence (eminent as it was) being rather the effect of <HI>con&s;titution</HI> than <HI>experience</HI> (a fine advantage, however, he &s;aid, to ground an unblameable future life upon) &s;he might not be apprehen&s;ive of bad de&s;igns, in a man &s;he loved: It was, therefore, a very heinous thing to abu&s;e the confidence of &s;uch a lady.</P>
<P>He was going on in this trite manner: But, interrupting him, I &s;aid; The&s;e general ob&s;ervations, Colonel, perhaps, &s;uit not this particular ca&s;e. But you your&s;elf are a man of gallantry; and, po&s;&s;ibly, were you to be put to the que&s;tion, might not be able to vindicate every action of your life, any more than I.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> You are welcome, Sir, to put what que&s;tions you
<PB N="91" REF="92">
plea&s;e to me. And, I thank God, I can both <HI>own</HI> and be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of my errors.</P>
<P>Lord M. looked at <HI>me</HI>; but as the Colonel did not by his manner &s;eem to intend a reflexion, I had no occa&s;ion to take it for one; e&s;pecially as I can as readily <HI>own</HI> my errors, as he, or any man can his, whether <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of them or not.</P>
<P>He proceeded. As you &s;eem to call upon me, Mr. Lovelace, I will tell you (without boa&s;ting of it) what has been my general practice, till lately, that I hope I have reformed it a good deal.</P>
<P>I have taken liberties, which the Laws of Morality will by no means ju&s;tify; and once I &s;hould have thought my|&s;elf warranted to cut the throat of any young fellow, who &s;hould make as free with a &s;i&s;ter of mine, as I have made with the &s;i&s;ters and daughters of others. But then I took care never to promi&s;e any thing I intended not to perform. A mode&s;t ear &s;hould as &s;oon have heard downright ob|&s;cenity from my lips, as matrimony, if I had not intended it. Young ladies are generally ready enough to believe we mean honourably, if they love us; and it would look like a &s;trange affront to their virtue and charms, that it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>needful</HI> to put the que&s;tion whether in your addre&s;s you mean a wife. But when once a man makes a promi&s;e, I think it ought to be performed; and a woman is well warranted to appeal to every one again&s;t the per|fidy of a deceiver; and is always &s;ure to have the world of her &s;ide.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, continued he, I believe you have &s;o much honour as to own, that you could not have made way to &s;o eminent a virtue, without promi&s;ing marriage; and that very explicitly and &s;olemnly&mdash;</P>
<P>I know very well, Colonel, interrupted I, all you would &s;ay&mdash;You will excu&s;e me, I am &s;ure, that I break in upon you, when you find it is to an&s;wer the end you drive at.</P>
<P>I own to you then, that I have acted very unworthily by Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe; and I'll tell you further, that I heartily repent of my ingratitude and ba&s;ene&s;s to her. Nay, I will &s;ay <HI>&s;till</HI> further, that I am &s;o gro&s;ly culpable <HI>as to her,</HI> that even to plead, that the abu&s;es and affronts I daily received from her implacable relations, were in any
<PB N="92" REF="93">
manner a provocation to me to act vilely by her, would be a mean and low attempt to excu&s;e my&s;elf&mdash;So low and &s;o mean, that it would doubly condemn me. And if you can &s;ay wor&s;e, &s;peak it.</P>
<P>He look'd upon Lord M. and then upon me, two or three times. And my Lord &s;aid, My kin&s;man &s;peaks what he thinks, I'll an&s;wer for him.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> I do, Sir; and what can I &s;ay more? And what further, in your opinion, can be done?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Done! Sir? Why, Sir, (in a haughty tone he &s;poke) I need not tell you that reparation follows repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tance. And I hope you make no &s;cruple of ju&s;tifying your &s;incerity as to the one, by the other.</P>
<P>I he&s;itated (for I reli&s;hed not the manner of his &s;peech and his haughty accent) as undetermined whether to take proper notice of it, or not.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Let me put this que&s;tion to you, Mr. Lovelace:&mdash;Is it true, as I have heard it is, That you would many my cou&s;in, if &s;he would have you?&mdash;What &s;ay you, Sir?&mdash;</P>
<P>This wound me up a peg higher?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Some que&s;tions, as they may be put, imply <HI>com|mands,</HI> Colonel. I would be glad to know how I am to take yours? And what is to be the end of your interrogatories?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> My que&s;tions are not meant by me as commands, Mr. Lovelace. The <HI>end</HI> is, to prevail upon a gentleman to act <HI>like</HI> a gentleman, and a man of honour.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> (<HI>bri&s;kly</HI>)
And by what arguments, Sir, do you propo&s;e to prevail upon me?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> By what arguments, Sir, prevail upon a gentleman to act like a gentleman!&mdash;I am &s;urpri&s;ed at That que&s;tion from Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Why &s;o, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> WHY so, Sir,
(<HI>angrily</HI>)
&mdash;Let me&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> (<HI>interrupting</HI>)
I don't choo&s;e, Colonel, to be re|peated upon, in that accent.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> Come, come, gentlemen, I beg of you to be willing to under&s;tand one another. You young gentlemen are &s;o warm&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Not I, my Lord&mdash;I am neither very young, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unduly warm. Your nephew, my Lord, can make me be every thing he would have me to be.</P>
<PB N="93" REF="94">
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> And that &s;hall be, whatever you plea&s;e to be, Colonel.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> (<HI>fiercely</HI>)
The choice be yours, Mr. Lovelace. Friend or foe! as you do or are willing to do ju&s;tice to one of the fine&s;t women in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> I gue&s;s'd from both your characters, what would be the ca&s;e when you met. Let me interpo&s;e, gen|tlemen, and beg you but to under&s;tand one another. You <HI>both &s;hoot at one mark</HI>; and if you are patient, will both <HI>hit it.</HI> Let me beg of you, Colonel, to give no chal|lenges&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Challenges, my Lord!&mdash;They are things I ever was readier to accept than to offer. But does your Lord|&s;hip think, that a man &s;o nearly related as I have the ho|nour to be to the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed woman on earth&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> (<HI>interrupting</HI>)
We all allow the excellencies of the lady&mdash;And we &s;hall all take it as the greate&s;t honour to be ally'd to her that can be conferred upon us.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> So you ought, my lord!&mdash;A perfect <HI>Chamont!</HI> thought I <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Otway</HI>'s Orphan.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> So we <HI>ought,</HI> Colonel! And &s;o we <HI>do!</HI>&mdash;And pray let <HI>every one</HI> do as he ought!&mdash;and no <HI>more</HI> than he <HI>ought</HI>; and you, Colonel, let me tell you, will not be &s;o ha&s;ty.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> (<HI>coolly</HI>)
Come, come, Col. Morden, don't let this di&s;pute, whatever you intend to make of it, go far|ther than with you and me. You deliver your&s;elf in very high terms. Higher than ever I was talked to in my life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut here, beneath this roof, 'twould be inexcu&s;able for me to take that notice of it, which perhaps it would be|come me to take el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> This is &s;poken as I wi&s;h the man to &s;peak, whom &s;hould be plea&s;ed to call my friend, if all his actions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere of a piece; and as I would have the man &s;peak, whom I would think it worth my while to call my foe, love a man of &s;pirit, as I love my &s;oul.

<P>Mowbray whi&s;per'd me, What is the cau&s;e, Bobby?&mdash;Shall I take the gentleman to ta&s;k, for thee, my boy?</P>
<P>Not for the world, whi&s;pered I. The Colonel is a gen|tleman, and I de&s;ire you'll not &s;ay one word.</P>
<P>Well, well, well, Bobby, I have done. I can turn thee loo&s;e to the be&s;t man upon God's earth, that's all, Bobby; &s;trutting off to the other end of the room.</P>

<P><HI>Col.</HI> If I had had the lea&s;t thought of proceeding to extremities, I am &s;ure Mr. Lovelace would have given me the honour of a meeting where I &s;hould have been le&s;s an intruder; but I came with an amicable intention;&mdash;To reconcile differences, rather than to widen them.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Well then, Col. Morden, let us enter upon the &s;ubject in your own way. I don't know the man I &s;hould &s;ooner choo&s;e to be upon terms with, than one whom Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe &s;o much re&s;pects.

<P><HI>Col. At all your reque&s;ts,</HI> my Lord?&mdash;I &s;hould have hoped, that Mr. Lovelace was di&s;po&s;ed to do ju&s;tice, for the <HI>&s;ake</HI> of ju&s;tice; and when, at the &s;ame time, the doing of ju&s;tice, was doing him&s;elf the highe&s;t honour.</P>
<P>Mowbray lifted up his before half-clo&s;ed eyes to the Colonel, and glanced them upon me.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> This is in very high language, Colonel.</P>
<P><HI>Mowbr.</HI> By my &s;oul, I thought &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Col. High</HI> language, Mr. Lovelace? Is it not <HI>ju&s;t</HI> lan|guage?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> It is, Colonel. And I think, the man that does honour to Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, does me honour. But, neverthele&s;s, there is a manner in &s;peaking, that may be liable to exception, where the words, without that man|ner, can bear none.</P>

<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Mowbray, is this acting like a friend by me, to &s;uppo&s;e me incapable of an&s;wering for my&s;elf? And &s;hall a man of honour and bravery, as I know Colonel Morden to be, (ra&s;h as perhaps in this vi&s;it he has &s;hewn him&s;elf) have it to &s;ay, that he comes to my Lord M's hou&s;e, in a manner naked as to attendants and friends, and &s;hall not for That rea&s;on be rather borne with, than in&s;ulted? This moment, my dear Mowbray, leave us. You have really no concern in this bu&s;ine&s;s; and if you are my friend, I de&s;ire you'll a&s;k the Colonel pardon for interfering in it in the manner you have done.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="98">
<P><HI>Mowbr.</HI> Well, well, Bob; thou &s;halt be arbiter in this matter. I know I have no bu&s;ine&s;s in it&mdash;And, Colonel,
(<HI>holding out his hand</HI>)
I leave you to one who knows how to defend his own cau&s;e, as well as any man in England.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> (<HI>taking Mowbray's hand, at Lord M's reque&s;t</HI>)
You need not tell me <HI>that,</HI> Mr. Mowbray. I have no doubt of Mr. Lovelace's ability to defend his own cau&s;e, were it a cau&s;e to be defended. And let me tell you, Mr. Love|lace, that I am a&s;toni&s;hed to think, that a brave man, and a generous man, as you have appeared to be in two or three in&s;tances that you have given in the little knowlege I have of you, &s;hould be capable of acting as you have done by the mo&s;t excellent of her &s;ex.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> Well, but, gentlemen, now Mr. Mowbray is gone; and you have both &s;hewn in&s;tances of courage and genero&s;ity to boot, let me de&s;ire you to lay your heads together amicably, and think whether there be any thing to be done to make all end happily for the lady?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> But hold, my Lord, let me &s;ay one thing, now Mowbray <HI>is</HI> gone; and that is, that I think a gentleman ought not to put up tamely one or two &s;evere things that the Colonel has &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> What the devil can&s;t thou mean? I thought all had been over. Why, thou ha&s;t nothing to do, but to confirm to the Colonel, that thou art willing to marry Mi&s;s Harlowe, if &s;he will have thee.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Mr. Lovelace will not &s;cruple to &s;ay <HI>That,</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e, notwith&s;tanding all that has pa&s;&s;ed: But if you think, Mr. Lovelace, I have &s;aid any thing I &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;e it is this: That the man who has &s;hewn &s;o little of the <HI>Thing</HI> Honour, to a defencele&s;s un|protected woman, ought not to &s;tand &s;o nicely upon the <HI>empty name</HI> of it, with a man who is expo&s;tulating with him upon it. I am &s;orry to have cau&s;e to &s;ay this, Mr. Lovelace; but I would on the &s;ame occa&s;ion repeat it to a King in all his glory, and &s;urrounded by all his guards.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> But what is all this, but more <HI>&s;acks upon the mill?</HI> more <HI>coals upon the fire?</HI> You have a mind to quarrel both of you, I &s;ee that. Are you not willing, Nephew, are you not <HI>mo&s;t</HI> willing, to marry this lady, if &s;he can be prevailed upon to have you?</P>
<PB N="98" REF="99">
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Damn me, my Lord, if I'd marry an Empre&s;s upon &s;uch treatment as this.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> Why now, Bob, thou art more choleric than the Colonel. It was <HI>his</HI> turn ju&s;t now. And now you &s;ee he is cool, you are all gunpowder.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> I own the Colonel has many advantages over me; but, perhaps, there is one advantage he has not, if it were put to the tryal.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I came not hither, as I &s;aid before, to &s;eek the oc|ca&s;ion: But if it be offered me, I won't refu&s;e it&mdash;And &s;ince we find we di&s;turb my good Lord M. I'll take my leave, and will go home by the way of St. Alban's.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> I'll &s;ee you part of the way, with all my heart, Colonel.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I accept your civility very chearfully, Mr. Love|lace.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> (<HI>interpo&s;ing again, as we were both for going out</HI>)
And what will this do, gentlemen? Suppo&s;e you kill one another, will the matter be better'd or wor&s;ted by that? Will the lady be made happier or unhappier, do you think by either or both of your deaths? Your cha|racters are too well known to make fre&s;h in&s;tances of the courage of either needful. And, I think, if the honour of the lady is your view, Colonel, it can be no other way &s;o effectually promoted, as by marriage. And, Sir, if <HI>you</HI> would u&s;e your intere&s;t with her, it is very probable, that <HI>you</HI> may &s;ucceed, tho' no body el&s;e can.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> I think, my Lord, I have &s;aid all that a man can &s;ay (&s;ince what is pa&s;&s;ed cannot be recalled) and you &s;ee Col. Morden ri&s;es in proportion to my coolne&s;s, till it is nece&s;&s;ary for me to a&s;&s;ert my&s;elf, or even <HI>he</HI> would de|&s;pi&s;e me.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> Let me a&s;k you, Colonel; Have you any way, any method, that you think rea&s;onable and honourable to propo&s;e, to bring about a reconciliation with the lady? That is what we all wi&s;h for. And I can tell you, Sir, it is not a little owing to her family, and to their implacable u&s;age of her, that her re&s;entments are heighten'd again&s;t my kin&s;man; who, however, has u&s;ed her vilely; but is willing to repair her wrongs.&mdash;</P>
<PB N="99" REF="100">
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Not, my Lord, for the &s;ake of her family; nor for this gentleman's haughty behaviour; but for <HI>her own &s;ake,</HI> and in full &s;en&s;e of the wrongs I have done her.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> As to my haughty behaviour, as you call it, Sir, I am mi&s;taken if you would not have gone beyond it in the like ca&s;e, of a relation &s;o meritorious, and &s;o unwor|thily injured. And, Sir, let me tell you, that if your mo|tives are not Love, Honour, and Ju&s;tice, and if they have the lea&s;t tincture of mean Compa&s;&s;ion for <HI>her,</HI> or of an unchearful a&s;&s;ent on <HI>your part,</HI> I am &s;ure it will neither be de&s;ired or accepted by a per&s;on of my cou&s;in's merit and &s;en&s;e; nor &s;hall I wi&s;h that it &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Don't think, Colonel, that I am meanly com|pounding off a debate, that I &s;hould as willingly go thro' with you as to eat or drink, if I have the occa&s;ion given me for it: But thus much I will tell you, That my Lord, that Lady Sarah Sadleir, Lady Betty Lawrance, my two cou&s;ins Montague, and my&s;elf, have written to her in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;incere manner, to offer her &s;uch terms, as no one but her&s;elf would refu&s;e, and this long enough before Col. Morden's arrival was dreamt of.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> What rea&s;on, Sir, may I a&s;k, does &s;he give, again&s;t li&s;tening to &s;o powerful a mediation, and to &s;uch offers?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> It looks like capitulating, or el&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> It looks not like any &s;uch thing to <HI>me,</HI> Mr. Love|lace, who have as good an opinion of your &s;pirit as man can have. And what, pray, is the part I act, and my mo|tives for it? Are they not, in de&s;iring that ju&s;tice may be done to my cou&s;in Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, that I &s;eek to e&s;tabli&s;h the honour of <HI>Mrs. Lovelace,</HI> if matters can once be brought to bear?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Were &s;he to honour me with her acceptance of That name, Mr. Morden, I &s;hould not want you or any man to a&s;&s;ert the honour of Mrs. Lovelace.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I believe it. But till &s;he <HI>has</HI> honoured you with that acceptance, &s;he is nearer to me than to you, Mr. Love|lace. And I &s;peak this, only to &s;hew you, that in the part I take, I mean rather to de&s;erve your thanks than your di&s;plea&s;ure, tho' again&s;t <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> were there occa&s;ion. Nor ought you to take it ami&s;s, if you rightly weigh the matter: For, Sir, whom does a lady want protection again&s;t, but
<PB N="100" REF="101">
her injurers? And who has been her <HI>greate&s;t</HI> injurer?&mdash;Till, therefore, &s;he becomes intitled to your protection, as <HI>your wife,</HI> you your&s;elf cannot refu&s;e me &s;ome merit in wi&s;hing to have ju&s;tice done <HI>my cou&s;in.</HI> But, Sir, you was going to &s;ay, that if it were not to look like capitulating, you would hint the rea&s;ons my cou&s;in gives again&s;t ac|cepting &s;uch an honourable mediation?</P>
<P>I then told him of my &s;incere offers of marriage;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I made no difficulty, I &s;aid, to own my apprehen&s;ions, that my unhappy behaviour to her, had greatly affected her: But that it was the implacablene&s;s of her friends that had thrown her into de&s;pair, and given her a con|tempt for life.'</Q>
I told him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That &s;he had been &s;o good, as to &s;end me a letter to divert me from a vi&s;it my heart was &s;et upon making her: A letter, on which I built great hopes, becau&s;e &s;he a&s;&s;ured me in it, that &s;he was <HI>going to her father's</HI>; and that <HI>I might &s;ee her there, when &s;he was received, if it were not my own fault.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Is it po&s;&s;ible? And were you, Sir, thus earne&s;t? And did &s;he &s;end you &s;uch a letter?</P>
<P>Lord M. confirmed both; and al&s;o, that, in obedience to her de&s;ires, and that intimation, I had come down with|out the &s;atisfaction I had propo&s;ed to my&s;elf in &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>It is very true, Colonel, &s;aid I: And I &s;hould have told you This before: But your heat made me decline it; for, as I &s;aid, it had an appearance of meanly capitulating with you. An abjectne&s;s of heart, of which had I been ca|pable, I &s;hould have de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>my&s;elf</HI> as much as I might have expected <HI>you</HI> would de&s;pi&s;e me.</P>
<P>Lord M. propo&s;ed to enter into the proof of all this: He &s;aid, in his phra&s;eological way, <HI>That one &s;tory was good, till another was heard:</HI> That the Harlowe family and I, 'twas true, had behaved like &s;o many <HI>Or&s;ons</HI> to one another; and that they had been very free with all our family be&s;ides: That neverthele&s;s, for the lady's &s;ake, more than for theirs, or even for <HI>mine</HI> (he could tell me) he would do greater things for me, than they could a&s;k, if &s;he could be brought to have me: And that this he <HI>wanted</HI> to declare, and would <HI>&s;ooner</HI> have declared, if he could have brought us &s;ooner to patience, and a good under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="102">The Colonel made excu&s;es for his warmth, on the &s;core of his affection to his cou&s;in.</P>
<P>My regard for her, made me readily admit them: And &s;o a fre&s;h bottle of Burgundy, and another of Champagne, being put upon the table, we &s;at down in good humour, after all this blu&s;tering, in order to enter clo&s;er into the particulars of the ca&s;e: Which I undertook, at both their de&s;ires, to do.</P>
<P>But the&s;e things mu&s;t be the &s;ubject of another letter, which &s;hall immediately follow this, if it do not accom|pany it.</P>
<P>Mean time you will ob&s;erve, That a bad cau&s;e gives a man great di&s;advantages: For I my&s;elf think, that the in|terrogatories put to me with &s;o much &s;pirit by the Co|lonel, made me look cur&s;edly mean; at the &s;ame time that it gave him a &s;uperiority which I know not how to allow to the be&s;t man in Europe. So that, literally &s;peak|ing, as a <HI>good man</HI> would infer, guilt is its own puni&s;her; in that it makes the mo&s;t lofty &s;pirit look like the mi&s;|creant he is&mdash;A <HI>good man,</HI> I &s;ay: So, Jack, <HI>proleptically,</HI> I add, <HI>Thou</HI> ha&s;t no right to make the ob&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day Afternoon, Aug.</HI> 29.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Went back in this part of our conver&s;ation to the day that I was obliged to come down to attend my Lord, in the dangerous illne&s;s which &s;ome feared would have been his la&s;t.</P>
<P>I told the Colonel
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What earne&s;t letters I had written to a particular friend, to engage him to prevail upon the lady not to &s;lip a day that had been propo&s;ed for the private celebration of our nuptials; and of my let|ters <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. V. p. 347, 250, 352, 354.</NOTE> written to her&s;elf on that &s;ubject;'</Q>
for I had &s;tept to my clo&s;et, and fetched down all the letters and draughts and copies of letters relating to this affair.</P>
<P>I read to him
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'&s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the copies of tho&s;e letters, which, thou wilt remember, make not a little to my honour. 
And I told him,
'That I wi&s;hed I had
<PB N="102" REF="103">
kept copies of tho&s;e to my friend on the &s;ame occa&s;ion; by which he would have &s;een how much in earne&s;t I was in my profe&s;&s;ions to her, altho' &s;he would not an|&s;wer one of them.'</Q>
And thou may&s;t remember, that one of tho&s;e four letters accounted to her&s;elf, why I was de|&s;irous &s;he &s;hould remain where I had left her <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. V. p. 348.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I then proceeded to give him an account
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'of the vi&s;it made by Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to Lord M. and me, in order to induce me to do her ju&s;tice. Of my readine&s;s to comply with their de&s;ires; and of their high opinion of her merit. Of the vi&s;it made to Mi&s;s Howe by my cou&s;ins Montague, in the name of us all, to in|gage her intere&s;t with her friend in my behalf. Of my conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Howe, at a private a&s;&s;emblee, to whom I gave the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances, and be&s;ought her intere&s;t with her friend.'</Q></P>
<P>I then read the copy of the letter, (tho' &s;o much to my di&s;advantage) which was written to her by Mi&s;s Charlotte Montague, Aug. 1. <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. VI. p. 324.</NOTE> intreating her alliance in the names of all our family.</P>
<P>This made him ready to think, that his fair cou&s;in car|ried her re&s;entment again&s;t me too far. He did not imagine, he &s;aid, that either my&s;elf or our family had been &s;o much in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>So thou &s;ee&s;t, Belford, that it is but glo&s;&s;ing over <HI>one</HI> part of a &s;tory, and omitting <HI>another,</HI> that will make a bad cau&s;e a good one at any time. What an admirable Lawyer &s;hould I have made! And what a poor hand would this charming creature, with all her innocence, have made of it in a court of ju&s;tice again&s;t a man who had &s;o much to <HI>&s;ay,</HI> and to <HI>&s;hew</HI> for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I then hinted at the generous annual tender which Lord M. and his &s;i&s;ters made to his fair cou&s;in, in apprehen&s;ion that &s;he might &s;uffer by her friends implacablene&s;s.</P>
<P>And this al&s;o the Colonel highly applauded, and was plea&s;ed to lament the unhappy mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two families, which had made the Harlowes le&s;s fond of an alliance with a family of &s;o much honour as this in|&s;tance &s;hewed ours to be.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">I then told him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That having, by my friend [mean|ing thee] who was admitted into her pre&s;ence (and who had always been an admirer of her virtues, and had given me &s;uch advice from time to time in relation to her as I wi&s;hed I had followed) been a&s;&s;ured, that a vi&s;it from me would be very di&s;agreeable to her, I once more re|&s;olved to try what a letter would do; and that accord|ingly, on the 7th of Augu&s;t, I wrote her one.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'This, Colonel, is the copy of it. I was then out of humour with my Lord M. and the Ladies of my family. You will therefore read it to your&s;elf <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. VI. p. 346.</NOTE>.'</Q></P>
<P>This letter gave him high &s;atisfaction. You write here, Mr. Lovelace, from your heart. 'Tis a letter full of pe|nitence and acknowlegement.

Pray, Sir, did &s;he return an an&s;wer to this letter?</P>
<P>She did, but with <HI>reluctance,</HI> I own, and not till I had declared, by my friend, that if I could not procure one, I would go up to town, and throw my&s;elf at her feet.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I might be permitted to &s;ee it, Sir, or to hear &s;uch parts of it read, as you &s;hall think proper.</P>

<P>This is very obliging, Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>He read it. My charming cou&s;in!&mdash;How &s;trong her re&s;entments!&mdash;Yet how charitable her wi&s;hes! Good God! that &s;uch an excellent creature!&mdash;But, Mr. Lovelace, it is to your regret, as much as to mine, I doubt not.&mdash;</P>
<P>Interrupting him, I &s;wore that it was.</P>
<P>So it ought, &s;aid he. Nor do I wonder that it &s;hould be &s;o. I &s;hall tell you by-and-by, proceeded he, how much &s;he &s;uffers with her friends, by fal&s;e and villainous reports. But, Sir, will you permit me to take with me the&s;e two letters? I &s;hall make u&s;e of them to the advan|tage of you both.</P>
<P>I told him, I would oblige him with all my heart. And this he took very kindly, as he had rea&s;on, and put them in his pocket-book, promi&s;ing to return them in a few days.</P>
<P>I then told him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That upon this refu&s;al, I took upon

<P><HI>Col.</HI> This is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing. But I cannot believe that my cou&s;in, for &s;uch an end <HI>only,</HI> or indeed for <HI>any</HI> end, according to the character I hear of her, &s;hould &s;toop to make u&s;e of &s;uch an artifice.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> This, Colonel, is the thing that a&s;toni&s;hes me; and yet, &s;ee here!&mdash;This is the letter &s;he wrote me;&mdash;Nay, Sir, 'tis her own hand.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I &s;ee it is; and a charming hand it is.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> You ob&s;erve, Colonel, that all her hopes of re|conciliation with her parents are from you. You are her <HI>dear ble&s;&s;ed friend!</HI> She always talked of you with de|light.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Would to heaven I had come to England before &s;he left Harlowe-Place. Nothing of this had then hap|pened. Not a man of tho&s;e whom I have heard that her friends propo&s;ed for her, &s;hould have had her. Nor you, Mr. Lovelace, unle&s;s I had found you to be the man every one who &s;ees you, mu&s;t wi&s;h you to be: And if you <HI>had</HI> been that man, no one living &s;hould I have preferred to you for &s;uch an excellence.</P>
<P>My Lord and I both joined in the wi&s;h: And 'faith, I wi&s;hed it mo&s;t cordially.</P>
<P>The Colonel read the letter twice over, and then re|turned it to me. 'Tis all a my&s;tery, &s;aid he: I can make
<PB N="105" REF="106">
nothing of it. For, alas! her friends are as aver&s;e to a re|conciliation as ever.</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> I could not have thought it. But don't you think there is &s;omething very favourable to my nephew in this letter?&mdash;Something that looks as if the lady would comply at la&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Let me die if I know what to make of it. This letter is very different from her preceding one!&mdash;You re|turned an an&s;wer to it, Mr. Lovelace?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> An an&s;wer, Colonel! No doubt of it. And an an&s;wer full of tran&s;port. I told her,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I would directly &s;et out for Lord M's, in obedience to her will.

But I cannot forbear &s;aying, that I am not a little &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed, if nothing more be meant by it than to get me into the country without &s;eeing her.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> That can't be the thing, depend upon it, Sir. There mu&s;t be more in it than That.

Only that &s;he does me a great deal of honour, if it be me that &s;he calls her <HI>ble&s;&s;ed friend, whom &s;he always loved and honoured.</HI> Indeed, I ever loved her: And if I die unmarried and without children, &s;hall be as kind to her, as her grandfather was: And the rather, as I fear that there is too much of envy and &s;elf-love in the re&s;entments her brother and &s;i&s;ter endeavour to keep up in her father and mother again&s;t her.

&s;uch &s;trong proof of, that it makes me que&s;tion the <HI>fir&s;t</HI>; &s;ince &s;he would not have been out of the way of my in|tended vi&s;it but for thee.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Are you &s;ure, Sir, that Mr. Belford is a man of honour?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> I can &s;wear for him, Colonel. What makes you put this que&s;tion?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Only this: That an officious pragmatical novice has been &s;ent up to inquire into my cou&s;in's life and con|ver&s;ation: And, would you believe it! the frequent vi&s;its of this gentleman have been interpreted ba&s;ely to her di&s;|reputation?&mdash;Read that letter, Mr. Lovelace, and you will be &s;hocked at every part of it.</P>
<P>This cur&s;ed letter, no doubt, is from the young Levite, whom thou, Jack, de&s;cribed&s;t, as making inquiry of Mrs. Smith about Mi&s;s Harlowe's character and vi&s;iters <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VI. p. 353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I believe I was a quarter of an hour in reading it: For I made it, tho' not a &s;hort one &s;ix times as long as it is, by the additions of oaths and cur&s;es to every pedantic line. Lord M. too helped to lengthen it, by the like execra|tions. And thou, Jack, wilt have as much rea&s;on to cur&s;e it, as we.</P>
<P>You cannot but &s;ee, &s;aid the Colonel, when I had done reading it, that this fellow has been <HI>officious</HI> in his male|volence; for what he &s;ays is mere hear&s;ay, and that hear|&s;ay conjectural &s;candal without fact, or the appearance of fact, to &s;upport it; &s;o that an unprejudiced eye, upon the face of the letter, would condemn the writer of it, as I did, and acquit my cou&s;in. But yet, &s;uch is the &s;pirit by which the re&s;t of my relations are governed, that they run away with the belief of the wor&s;t it in&s;inuates, and the dear creature has had &s;hocking letters upon it; the pedant's hints are taken; and a voyage to one of the colonies has been propo&s;ed to her, as the only way to avoid Mr. Bel|ford and you. I have not &s;een the&s;e letters indeed; but they took a pride in repeating &s;ome of their contents, which mu&s;t have cut the poor &s;oul to the heart; and the&s;e, joined to her former &s;ufferings&mdash;What have you not, Mr. Love|lace, to an&s;wer for?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> Who the devil could have expected &s;uch con&s;e|quences as the&s;e? Who could have believed there could
<PB N="107" REF="108">
be parents &s;o implacable? Brother and &s;i&s;ter &s;o envious? And, give me leave to &s;ay, a lady &s;o immoveably fixed again&s;t the only means that could be taken to put all right with every body?&mdash;And what now can be done?</P>
<P><HI>Lord M.</HI> I have great hopes, that Col. Morden may yet prevail upon his cou&s;in. And by her la&s;t letter, it runs in my mind, that &s;he has &s;ome thoughts of forgiving all that's pa&s;t. Do you think, Colonel, if there &s;hould <HI>not</HI> be &s;uch a thing as a reconciliation going forward at pre&s;ent, that her letter may not imply, that if we <HI>could</HI> bring &s;uch a thing to bear with her friends, &s;he would be reconciled to Mr. Lovelace?</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Such an artifice would better become the Italian &s;ubtlety than the Engli&s;h &s;implicity. Your Lord&s;hip has been in Italy, I pre&s;ume?</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> My Lord has read Boccacio, perhaps, and that's as well, as to the hint he gives, which may be borrowed from one of that author's &s;tories. But Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Har|lowe is above all artifice. She mu&s;t have &s;ome meaning I cannot fathom.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> Well, my Lord, I can only &s;ay, That I will make &s;ome u&s;e of the letters Mr. Lovelace has obliged me with: And after I have had &s;ome talk with my cou&s;in James, who is hourly expected; and when I have di&s;|patched two or three affairs that pre&s;s upon me; I will pay my re&s;pects to my dear cou&s;in; and &s;hall then be able to form a better judgment of things. Mean time I will write to her; for I have &s;ent to inquire about her, and find &s;he wants con&s;olation.</P>
<P><HI>Lovel.</HI> If you favour me, Colonel, with the damned letter of that fellow Brand, for a day or two, you will oblige me.</P>
<P><HI>Col.</HI> I will. But remember, the man is a par&s;on, Mr. Lovelace; an innocent one too, they &s;ay. El&s;e I had been at him before now. And the&s;e college novices, who think they know every thing in their cloy&s;ters, and that all learn|ing lies in <HI>books,</HI> make di&s;mal figures when they come into the world among <HI>men</HI> and <HI>women.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord M. Brand! Brand!</HI> It &s;hould have been <HI>Fire|brand,</HI> I think in my con&s;cience!</P>
<P>Thus ended this doughty conference.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">I cannot &s;ay, Jack, but I am greatly taken with Col. Morden. He is brave and generous, and knows the world; and then his contempt of the par&s;ons is a certain &s;ign that he is one of <HI>Us.</HI></P>
<P>We parted with great civility; Lord M. (not a little plea&s;ed that we did, and as greatly taken with the Colonel) repeated his wi&s;h, after the Colonel was gone, that he had arrived in time to &s;ave the lady; if that would have done it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h &s;o too. For by my &s;oul, Jack, I am every day more and more unea&s;y about her. But I hope &s;he is not &s;o ill as I am told &s;he is.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e this <HI>Fire-Brand</HI>'s letter, as my Lord calls him. I reckon it will rouze all thy phlegm into vengeance.</P>
<P>I know not what to advi&s;e as to &s;hewing it to the lady. Yet, perhaps, &s;he will be able to reap more &s;atisfaction than concern from it, knowing her own innocence; in that it will give her to hope, that her friends treatment of her, is owing as much to mi&s;repre&s;entation, as to their own natural implacablene&s;s. Such a mind as her's, I know, would be glad to find out the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on for the &s;hocking letters the Colonel &s;ays they have &s;ent her, and for their propo&s;al to her, of going to &s;ome one of the co|lonies. (Confound them all&mdash;But if I begin to cur&s;e, I &s;hall never have done)&mdash;Then it may put her upon &s;uch a defence, as &s;he might be glad of an opportunity to make, and to &s;hame them for their mon&s;trous credulity&mdash;But this I leave to thy own fat-headed prudence&mdash;Only it vexes me to the heart, that even &s;candal and calumny &s;hould dare to &s;urmi&s;e the bare po&s;&s;ibility of any man's &s;haring the fa|vours of a lady, whom now methinks I could wor&s;hip with a veneration due only to a divinity.</P>
<P>Charlotte and her &s;i&s;ter could not help weeping at the ba&s;e a&s;per&s;ion: When, when, &s;aid Patty, lifting up her hands, will this &s;weet lady's &s;ufferings be at an end?&mdash;Oh cou&s;in Lovelace!&mdash;</P>
<P>And thus am I blamed for every one's faults!&mdash;When her brutal father cur&s;es her, it is I. I upbraid her with her &s;evere mother. Her &s;tupid uncle's implacablene&s;s is all mine. Her brother's virulence, and her &s;i&s;ter's &s;pite and envy, are intirely owing to me. This ra&s;cal Brand's letter is of my writing&mdash;O Jack, what a wretch is thy Lovelace!</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="110">RETURNED without a letter!&mdash;This damned fellow Will is returned without a letter! Yet the ra&s;cal tells me that he hears you have been writing to me the&s;e two days!</P>
<P>Plague confound thee, who mu&s;t know my impatience, and the rea&s;on for it!</P>
<P>To &s;end a man and hor&s;e on purpo&s;e; as I did! My imagination chained to the belly of the bea&s;t, in order to keep pace with him! Now he is got to this place; Now to that; Now to London; Now to thee.</P>
<P>Now (a letter given him) whip and &s;pur upon the re|turn. This town ju&s;t entered, not &s;taying to bait: That village pa&s;&s;ed by: Leaves the wind behind him; in a foam|ing &s;weat man and hor&s;e.</P>
<P>And in this way did he actually enter Lord M.'s court|yard.</P>
<P>The reverberating pavement brought me down&mdash;The letter, Will! The letter, dog!&mdash;The letter, Sirrah!</P>
<P>No letter, Sir!&mdash;Then wildly &s;taring round me, fi&s;ts clenched, and grinning like a maniac, Confound thee for a dog, and him that &s;ent thee without one!&mdash;This mo|ment out of my &s;ight, or I'll &s;catter thy &s;tupid brains thro' the air; &s;natching from his hol&s;ters a pi&s;tol, while the ra&s;|cal threw him&s;elf from the foaming bea&s;t, and run to avoid the fate, which I wi&s;hed with all my &s;oul thou had&s;t been within the reach of me, to have met with.</P>
<P>But, to be as meek as a lamb to one who has me at his mercy, and can wring and torture my &s;oul as he plea&s;es, <HI>What can&s;t thou mean</HI> to &s;end back my varlet without a let|ter?&mdash;I will &s;end away by day-dawn another fellow up|on another bea&s;t for what thou ha&s;t written; and I charge thee on thy allegiance, that thou di&s;patch him not back empty-handed.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>(Inclo&s;ed in the preceding)</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir, my very good Friend and Patron,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Arrived in town ye&s;terday, after a tolerable plea&s;ant journey (con&s;idering the hot weather and du&s;ty roads),
<PB N="110" REF="111">
I put up at the Bull and Gate in Holborn, and ha&s;tened to Covent-garden. I &s;oon found the hou&s;e where the unhappy lady lodges. And, in the back-&s;hop, had a good deal of di&s;cour&s;e <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VI. p. 353.</NOTE> with Mrs. Smith, (her landlady) whom I found to be &s;o <HI>highly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed</HI> in her <HI>favour,</HI> that I &s;aw it would not an&s;wer your de&s;ires to take my in|formations <HI>altogether</HI> from her, and being obliged to at|tend my patron; who, to my &s;orrow,
<Q>(Mi&s;erum e&s;t aliena vivere quadra)</Q>
I find wants much waiting upon, and is <HI>another</HI> &s;ort of man than he was at college: For, Sir, (<HI>inter nos) honours change manners.</HI> For the <HI>afore&s;aid cau&s;es</HI> I thought it would be&s;t an&s;wer all the ends of the commi&s;&s;ion you honoured me with, to engage, in the de&s;ired &s;crutiny, the wife of a <HI>par|ticular friend,</HI> who lives almo&s;t over again&s;t the hou&s;e where &s;he lodges, and who is a gentlewoman of <HI>character</HI> and <HI>&s;obriety,</HI> a <HI>mother of children,</HI> and one who <HI>knows</HI> the <HI>world</HI> well.</P>
<P>To her I applied my&s;elf, therefore, and gave her a &s;hort hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e, and de&s;ired &s;he would very particularly enquire into the <HI>conduct</HI> of the unhappy young lady; her <HI>pre&s;ent way of life</HI> and <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;tence</HI>; her <HI>vi&s;iters,</HI> her <HI>im|ployments,</HI> and &s;uch-like; for the&s;e, Sir, you know, are the things whereof you wi&s;hed to be informed.</P>
<P>Accordingly, Sir, I waited upon the gentlewoman afore|&s;aid, this day; and, to <HI>my</HI> very great trouble (becau&s;e I know it will be to <HI>yours,</HI> and likewi&s;e to all your worthy family's) I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I do find things look a little more <HI>darkly,</HI> than I hoped they would. For, alas! Sir, the gentlewoman's report turns not out &s;o <HI>favourable</HI> for Mi&s;s's reputation, as <HI>I</HI> wi&s;hed, as <HI>you</HI> wi&s;hed, and as <HI>every one</HI> of her friends wi&s;hed. But &s;o it is throughout the world, that <HI>one fal&s;e &s;tep</HI> generally brings on <HI>another</HI>; and peradventure <HI>a wor&s;e,</HI> and <HI>a &s;till wor&s;e</HI>; till the poor <HI>limed &s;oul,</HI> (a very fit epithet of the divine Quarles's!) is quite <HI>entangled,</HI> and, (without infinite <HI>mercy</HI>) lo&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, Sir, &s;he is, notwith&s;tanding, in a very <HI>ill &s;tate of health.</HI> In this, both gentlewomen (that is to &s;ay, Mrs. Smith her landlady, and my friend's wife) agree. Yet &s;he goes often out in a chair, to <HI>prayers,</HI> (as it is &s;aid). But
<PB N="111" REF="112">
my friend's wife tells me, that nothing is more common in London, than that the frequenting of the church at morning prayers, is made the <HI>pretence</HI> and <HI>cover</HI> for <HI>pri|vate a&s;&s;ignations.</HI> What a &s;ad thing is this! that what was de&s;igned for <HI>whol&s;ome nouri&s;hment</HI> to the <HI>poor &s;oul,</HI> &s;hould be turned into <HI>rank poi&s;on</HI>! But as Mr. Daniel de Foe, an ingenious man, tho' a <HI>di&s;&s;enter,</HI> ob&s;erves (But indeed it is an old proverb; only I think he was the fir&s;t that put it into ver&s;e)
<Q><L>God never had a hou&s;e of pray'r,</L>
<L>But Satan had a chapel there.</L></Q></P>
<P>Yet, to do the lady <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> no-body comes home with her: Nor, indeed <HI>can</HI> they, becau&s;e &s;he goes forward and backward in a <HI>&s;edan</HI> or <HI>chair</HI> (as they call it). But then there is a gentleman of <HI>no good character</HI> (an <HI>intimado</HI> of Mr. Lovelace's) who is a <HI>con&s;tant</HI> vi&s;iter of her, and of the people of the hou&s;e, whom he <HI>regales</HI> and <HI>treats,</HI> and has (of con&s;equence) their <HI>high good words.</HI></P>
<P>I have hereupon taken the trouble (for I love to be <HI>ex|act</HI> in any <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> I undertake) to inquire <HI>particularly</HI> about this <HI>gentleman,</HI> as he is called (albeit I hold no man &s;o but by his actions: For, as Juvenal &s;ays,
<Q>&mdash;Nobilitas &s;ola e&s;t, atque unica virtus)</Q>
And this I did <HI>before</HI> I would &s;it down to write to you.</P>
<P>His name is Belford. He has a paternal e&s;tate of up|wards of 1000 pounds by the year; and is now in mourn|ing for an uncle who left him very con&s;iderably be&s;ides. He bears a very profligate character as to <HI>women</HI> (for I en|quired <HI>particularly</HI> about <HI>That</HI>), and is Mr. Lovelace's more e&s;pecial <HI>privado,</HI> with whom he holds a <HI>regular cor|re&s;pondence</HI>; and has been often &s;een with Mi&s;s (t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te) at the <HI>window</HI>: In no <HI>bad way,</HI> indeed: But my friend's wife is of opinion, that all is not <HI>as it &s;hould be.</HI> And indeed, it is mighty &s;trange to me, if Mi&s;s be &s;o <HI>not|able a penitent</HI> (as is repre&s;ented) and if &s;he have &s;uch an <HI>aver&s;ion</HI> to Mr. Lovelace, that &s;he will admit his <HI>privado</HI> into <HI>her retirements,</HI> and &s;ee <HI>no other company.</HI></P>
<P>I under&s;tand, from Mrs. Smith, that Mr. Hickman was to &s;ee her &s;ome time ago, from Mi&s;s Howe; and I am told, by <HI>another</HI> hand (You &s;ee, Sir, how diligent I have been to execute the <HI>commi&s;&s;ions</HI> you had given me) that he
<PB N="112" REF="113">
had no <HI>extraordinary opinion</HI> of this Belford, at fir&s;t; tho' they were &s;een together one morning by the oppo&s;ite neigh|bour, at <HI>breakfa&s;t with Mi&s;s:</HI> And another time this Bel|ford was ob&s;erved to <HI>watch</HI> Mr. Hickman's coming from her; &s;o that, as it &s;hould &s;eem, he was mighty zealous to <HI>in|gratiate</HI> him&s;elf with Mr. Hickman; no doubt, to engage him to make a <HI>favourable report to Mi&s;s Howe</HI> of the <HI>inti|macy</HI> he was admitted into by her unhappy friend; who, (<HI>as &s;he is very ill</HI>) may <HI>mean no harm</HI> in allowing his vi&s;its (for he, it &s;eems, brought to her, or recommended, at lea&s;t, the doctor and apothecary that attend her): But I think, upon the whole, it <HI>looketh not well.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, I cannot give you a better account of the young lady's <HI>prudence.</HI> But, what &s;hall we &s;ay?
<Q>Uvaque con&s;pect&acirc; livorem ducit ab uv&acirc;,</Q>
as Juvenal ob&s;erves.</P>
<P>One thing I am afraid of; which is, That Mi&s;s may be under <HI>nece&s;&s;ities</HI>; and that this Belford (who, as Mrs. Smith owns, has <HI>offered her money,</HI> which &s;he, <HI>at the time,</HI> refu&s;ed) may find an opportunity to <HI>take advantage</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>nece&s;&s;ities:</HI> And it is well ob&s;erved by the poet, that
<Q><L>Aegr&egrave; formo&s;am poteris &s;ervare puellam:</L>
<L>Nunc proce, nunc auro forma petita ruit.</L></Q></P>
<P>And this Belford (who is a <HI>bold man,</HI> and has, as they &s;ay, the <HI>look</HI> of one) may make good that of Horace (with who&s;e writings you are &s;o well acquainted; nobody better)
<Q><L>Audax omnia perpeti,</L>
<L>Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas.</L></Q></P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir, for what I am going to write: But if you could prevail upon the re&s;t of your family, to join in the &s;cheme which <HI>you,</HI> and her <HI>virtuous &s;i&s;ter,</HI> Mi&s;s Ara|bella, and the archdeacon, and I, once talked of, (which is, to per&s;uade the unhappy young lady to go, in &s;ome <HI>creditable</HI> manner, to &s;ome one of the foreign colonies) it might &s;ave not only her <HI>own credit</HI> and <HI>reputation,</HI> but the <HI>reputation</HI> and <HI>credit</HI> of all her <HI>family,</HI> and a great deal of <HI>vex|ation</HI> moreover. For it is my humble opinion, that you will hardly, any of you, injoy your&s;elves while this (<HI>once</HI> inno|cent) young lady is in the way of being &s;o frequently heard of by you: And this would put her <HI>out of the way</HI> both of
<PB N="113" REF="114">
<HI>this Belford</HI> and of <HI>that Lovelace,</HI> and it might, peradven|ture, prevent as much <HI>evil</HI> as <HI>&s;candal.</HI></P>
<P>You will forgive me, Sir, for this my <HI>plainne&s;s.</HI> Ovid pleads for me,
<Q>&mdash;Adulator nullus amicus erit.</Q></P>
<P>And I have no view but that of approving my&s;elf a <HI>zea|lous well-wi&s;her</HI> to <HI>all</HI> your worthy family (whereto I owe a great number of obligations) and very particularly, Sir,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. Mr. <HI>BELFORD,</HI> To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day night, Aug.</HI> 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT was lucky enough that our two &s;ervants met at Han|nah's <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The windmill, near Slough.</NOTE>, which gave them &s;o good an opportunity of exchanging their letters time enough for each to return to his ma&s;ter early in the day.</P>
<P>Thou do&s;t well to brag of thy capacity for managing &s;ervants, and to &s;et up for correcting our poets in their characters of this cla&s;s of people <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Letter V. of this Vol. p. 23.</NOTE>, when, like a mad man, thou can&s;t beat their teeth out, and attempt to &s;hoot them thro' the head, for not bringing to thee what they had no power to obtain.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">You well ob&s;erve <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 102.</NOTE> that you would have made a thorough-pac'd Lawyer. The whole of the conver&s;ation-piece between you and the Colonel, affords a convincing proof, that there is a black and a white &s;ide to every cau&s;e: But what mu&s;t the con&s;cience of a partial whitener of his <HI>own</HI> cau&s;e, or blackener of <HI>another's,</HI> tell him, while he is throwing du&s;t in the eyes of his judges, and all the time knows his own guilt?</P>
<P>The Colonel, I &s;ee, is far from being a faultle&s;s man: But while he &s;ought not to carry his point by breach of faith, he has an excu&s;e which thou ha&s;t not. But with-re|&s;pect to him, and to us all, I can now, with dete&s;tation of &s;ome of my own actions, &s;ee, that the taking advantage of another per&s;on's good opinion of us, to injure (perhaps to ruin) that other, is the mo&s;t ungenerous wickedne&s;s that can be committed.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> acting thus by <HI>man,</HI> we &s;hould not be at a lo&s;s to give &s;uch actions a name: But is it not doubly and trebly aggravated, when &s;uch advantage is taken of an inexpe|rienced and innocent young creature, whom we pretend to love above all the women in the world; and when we &s;eal our pretences by the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows and prote&s;ta|tions of inviolable honour, that we can invent?</P>
<P>I &s;ee that this gentleman is the be&s;t match thou ever coulde&s;t have had, upon all accounts: His &s;pirit &s;uch an|other impetuous one as thy own; &s;oon taking fire: vin|dictive; and only differing in This, that the cau&s;e he in|gages in is a ju&s;t one. But, commend me to hone&s;t brutal Mowbray, who, before he knew the cau&s;e, offers his &s;word in thy behalf again&s;t a man who had taken the injured &s;ide, and whom he had never &s;een before.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had run thro' your letters, and that incen|diary Brand's (by the latter of which I &s;aw to what cau&s;e a great deal of this la&s;t implacablene&s;s of the Harlowe fa|mily is owing) I took coach to Smith's, altho' I had been come from thence but about an hour, and had taken leave of the lady for the night.</P>
<P>I &s;ent down for Mrs. Lovick, and de&s;ired her, in the fir&s;t place, to acquaint the lady (who was bu&s;ied in her clo&s;et) that I had letters from Berks: In which I was informed,

that the interview between Col. Morden and Mr. Love|lace had ended without ill con&s;equences; that the Colonel intended to write to her very &s;oon, and was intere&s;ting him|&s;elf mean while in her favour, with her relations; that I hoped, that this agreeable news would be a means of giv|ing her good re&s;t; and I would wait upon her in the morn|ing, by the time &s;he &s;hould return from prayers, with all the particulars.</P>
<P>She &s;ent me word, that &s;he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee me in the morning; and was highly obliged to me for the good news I had &s;ent her up.</P>
<P>I then, in the back-&s;hop, read to Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter, and a&s;ked them, If they could gue&s;s at the man's informant? They were not at a lo&s;s, Mrs. Smith having &s;een the &s;ame fellow Brand who had talked with her, as I mentioned in a former <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vol. VI. p. 353.</NOTE>, come out of a milliner's &s;hop over-again&s;t them; which milliner, &s;he &s;aid, had al&s;o been lately very inqui&s;itive about the lady.</P>
<P>I wanted no further hint; but, bidding them take no notice to the lady of what I had read, I &s;hot over the way, and a&s;king for the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, &s;he came to me.</P>
<P>Retiring with her, at her invitation, into her parlour, I de&s;ired to know, if &s;he was acquainted with a young coun|try clergyman of the name of Brand. She he&s;itatingly, &s;eeing me in &s;ome emotion, owned, that &s;he had &s;ome &s;mall know|lege of the gentleman. Ju&s;t then came in her hu&s;band, who is, it &s;eems, a petty officer in the exci&s;e, and not an ill-behaved man, who owned a fuller knowlege of him.</P>
<P>I have the copy of a letter, &s;aid I, from this Brand, in which he has taken great liberties with my character, and with That of the mo&s;t unblameable lady in the world, which he grounds upon informations that you, Madam, have given him. And then I read to them &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his letter; and a&s;ked, What foundation &s;he had for giving that fellow &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of either of us?</P>
<P>They knew not what to an&s;wer: But, at la&s;t, &s;aid, that he had told them how wickedly the young lady had run away from her parents: What worthy and rich people they were: In what favour <HI>he</HI> &s;tood with them; and that they had imployed him to inquire after her behaviour, vi&s;iters, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">They &s;aid, That indeed they knew very little of the young lady; but that [Cur&s;e upon their cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s!] it was but too natural to think, that where a lady had given way to a delu&s;ion, and taken &s;o wrong a &s;tep, &s;he would not &s;top there: That the mo&s;t &s;acred places and things were but too often made a cloak for bad actions. That Mr. Brand had been informed (perhaps by &s;ome ene|my of mine) that I was a man of very free principles, and an <HI>intimado,</HI> as he calls it, of the man who had ruined her. And that their cou&s;in Barker, a mantua-maker, who lodged up one pair of &s;tairs, had often from her window, &s;een me with the lady in her chamber, talking very earne&s;tly together: And that Mr. Brand being unable to account for her admitting my vi&s;its, and knowing I was but a new ac|quaintance of hers, and an old one of Mr. Lovelace's, thought him&s;elf obliged to lay the&s;e matters before her friends.</P>
<P>This was the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of their tale. O how I cur&s;ed the cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s of this plaguy triumvirate! A par&s;on, a milliner, and a mantua-maker! The two latter, not more by <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> led to adorn the per&s;on, than gene|rally by <HI>&s;candal</HI> to de&s;troy the <HI>reputations</HI> of tho&s;e they have a mind to exerci&s;e their talents upon!</P>
<P>The two women took great pains to per&s;uade me, that they were people of con&s;cience:&mdash;Of con&s;equence, I told them, too much addicted, I doubted, to cen&s;ure other people who pretended not to their &s;trictne&s;s; for that I had ever found cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, narrowne&s;s, and unchari|tablene&s;s to prevail too much with tho&s;e who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours.</P>
<P>That was not them, they &s;aid; and that they had &s;ince inquired into the lady's character and manner of life, and were very much concerned to think any thing they had &s;aid &s;hould be made u&s;e of again&s;t her: And as they heard from Mrs. Smith, that &s;he was not likely to live long, they &s;hould be &s;orry &s;he &s;hould go out of the world a &s;uf|ferer by their means, or with an ill opinion of them, tho' &s;trangers to her. The hu&s;band offered to write, if I plea&s;ed to Mr. Brand, in vindication of the lady; and the two women &s;aid, they &s;hould be glad to wait upon her in per|&s;on, to beg her pardon for any thing &s;he had rea&s;on to
<PB N="117" REF="118">
take ami&s;s from them; becau&s;e they were now convinced that there was not &s;uch another young lady in the world.</P>
<P>I told them, That the lea&s;t &s;aid of the affair to the lady in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, was be&s;t. That &s;he was fond of taking all occa&s;ions to find excu&s;es for her relati|ons on their implacablene&s;s to her; That therefore I &s;hould take &s;ome notice to her of the uncharitable and weak &s;urmizes which gave birth to &s;o vile a &s;candal. But that I would have him, Mr. Walton, (for that is the hu&s;|band's name) write to his acquaintance Brand, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as he had offered.&mdash;And &s;o I left them.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t come from the lady, whom I left chearful and &s;erene.</P>
<P>She thanked me for my communication of the preced|ing night. I read to her &s;uch parts of your letters as I <HI>could</HI> read to her; and I thought it was a good te&s;t to di&s;|tingui&s;h the froth and whipt-&s;yllabub in them from the cream, in what one <HI>could</HI> and could <HI>not</HI> read to a woman of &s;o fine a mind; &s;ince four parts out of &s;ix of thy letters, which I thought entertaining as I read them to my&s;elf, ap|peared to me, when I would have read them to her, mo&s;t abominable &s;tuff, and gave me a very contemptible idea of thy talents, and of my own judgment.</P>
<P>She was far from rejoicing, as I had done, at the di&s;|appointment her letter gave you when explained.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, &s;he meant only an innocent allegory, that might carry in&s;truction and warning to you, when the meaning was taken, as well as an&s;wer her own hopes for the time. It was run off in a hurry. She was afraid, it was not quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight in <HI>her.</HI> But hoped the end would excu&s;e, if it could not ju&s;tify, the means. And then &s;he again expre&s;&s;ed a good deal of apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t you &s;hould &s;till take it into your head to mole&s;t her, when her time, &s;he &s;ays, is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hort, that &s;he wants every moment of it; repeating what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he had once &s;aid before, That when &s;he wrote, &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ill, that &s;he believed, &s;he &s;hould not have lived till now:
<PB N="118" REF="119">
If &s;he had thought &s;he &s;hould, &s;he mu&s;t have thought of an expedient that would have better an&s;wered her intentions; hinting at a removal out of the knowlege of us both.</P>
<P>But &s;he was much plea&s;ed that the conference between you and Colonel Morden ended &s;o amicably, after two or three &s;uch violent &s;allies, as I acquainted her you had had between you; and &s;aid, &s;he mu&s;t ab&s;olutely depend upon the promi&s;e I had given her to u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent further mi&s;chief on her account.</P>
<P>She was plea&s;ed with the ju&s;tice you did her character to her cou&s;in.</P>
<P>She was glad to hear, that he had &s;o kind an opinion of her, and that he would write to her.</P>
<P>I was under an unnece&s;&s;ary concern, how to break to her, that I had the copy of Brand's vile letter: <HI>Unnece&s;|&s;ary,</HI> I &s;ay; for &s;he took it ju&s;t as you thought &s;he would, as an excu&s;e &s;he wi&s;hed to have for the implacablene&s;s of her friends; and begg'd I would let her read it her&s;elf; for, &s;aid &s;he, the contents cannot di&s;turb me, be they what they will.</P>
<P>I gave it her, and &s;he read it to her&s;elf, a tear now-and-then ready to &s;tart, and a &s;igh &s;ometimes interpo&s;ing.</P>
<P>She gave me back the letter with great and &s;urpri&s;ing calmne&s;s, con&s;idering the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>There was a time, &s;aid &s;he, and that not long &s;ince, when &s;uch a letter as this would have greatly pained me. But I hope, I have now got above all the&s;e things; for I can refer to your kind offices, and Mi&s;s Howe's, the ju&s;tice that will be done to my memory among my friends. There is a good and a bad light in which every thing that befals us, may be taken. If the human mind will bu&s;y it&s;elf to make the wor&s;t of every di&s;agreeable occurrence, it will never want woe. This letter, affecting as the &s;ubject of it is to my reputation, gives me more plea&s;ure than pain, be|cau&s;e I can gather from it, that had not my friends been prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by mi&s;informed, or ra&s;h and officious per&s;ons, who are always at hand to flatter or &s;ooth the pa&s;&s;ions of the affluent, they could not have been &s;o immoveably de|termined again&s;t me. But now, they are &s;ufficiently cleared from every imputation of unforgivene&s;s; for, while I ap|peared to them in the character of a vile hypocrite, pre|tending
<PB N="119" REF="120">
to true penitence, yet giving up my&s;elf to pro|fligate cour&s;es, how could I expect either their pardon or ble&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P>But, Madam, &s;aid I, you'll &s;ee by the date of this letter, Augu&s;t 9, that their &s;everity, <HI>previous</HI> to that, cannot be excu&s;ed by it.</P>
<P>It imports me much, replied &s;he, on account of my pre|&s;ent wi&s;hes, as to the office you are &s;o kind to undertake, that you &s;hould not think har&s;hly of my friends. I mu&s;t own to you, that I have been apt &s;ometimes my&s;elf to think them not only &s;evere, but cruel. Suffering minds will be partial to their own cau&s;e and merits. Knowing their own hearts, if &s;incere, they are apt to murmur when har&s;hly treated: But if they are not <HI>believed</HI> to be innocent by per&s;ons, who have a right to decide upon their conduct ac|cording to their own judgments, how can it be helped? Be&s;ides, Sir, How do you know, that there are not about my friends as well-meaning mi&s;repre&s;enters as Mr. Brand really &s;eems to be? But be this as it will, there is no doubt that there are and have been multitudes of per&s;ons, as in|nocent as my&s;elf, who have &s;uffered upon &s;urmi&s;es as little probable as tho&s;e on which Mr. Brand founds his judg|ment. Your intimacy, Sir, with Mr. Lovelace, and (may I &s;ay?) a character which, it &s;eems, you have been le&s;s &s;ollicitous formerly about ju&s;tifying, than perhaps you will be for the future; and your frequent vi&s;its to me, may well be thought to be que&s;tionable circum&s;tances in my conduct.</P>
<P>I could only admire her in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>But you &s;ee, Sir, proceeded &s;he, how nece&s;&s;ary it is for young people of our &s;ex, to be careful of our company: And how much, at the &s;ame time, it behoves young gen|tlemen to be chary of their own reputation, were it only for the &s;ake of &s;uch of ours, as they may mean honourably by; and who otherwi&s;e may &s;uffer in their good names for being &s;een in their company.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Brand, continued &s;he, he is to be pitied; and let me injoin you, Mr. Belford, not to take up any re|&s;entments again&s;t him which may be detrimental either to his per&s;on or his fortunes. Let his function and his good meaning plead for him. He will have concern enough,
<PB N="120" REF="121">
when he finds every body who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure I now labour under, acquitting my memory of perver&s;e guilt, and join|ing in a general pity for me.</P>
<P>This, Lovelace, is the lady who&s;e life thou ha&s;t cur|tailed in the blo&s;&s;om of it!&mdash;How many opportunities mu&s;t thou have had of admiring her ine&s;timable worth, yet could&s;t have thy &s;en&s;es &s;o much ab&s;orbed in the WOMAN in her charming per&s;on, as to be blind to the ANGEL that &s;hines out in &s;uch full glory in her mind? Indeed, I have ever thought my&s;elf, when ble&s;t with her conver&s;a|tion, in the company of a real angel: And I am &s;ure it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me, were &s;he to be as beautiful, and as crim&s;oned over with health as I have &s;een her, to have the lea&s;t thought of Sex, when I heard her talk.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to condole tho&s;e misfortunes, which have occa&s;ioned &s;o unhappy a difference between you, and the re&s;t of your family: And to offer my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enable you to make the be&s;t of what has happened.</P>
<P>You have fallen into mo&s;t unworthy hands. The letter I wrote to you from Florence <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. III. p. 356.</NOTE> I find, came too late to have its hoped-for effect. I am very &s;orry it did: As I am that I did not come &s;ooner to England in per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="122">But, forgetting pa&s;t things, let us look forward. I have been with Mr. Lovelace, and Lord M. I need not tell <HI>you,</HI> it &s;eems, how de&s;irous all the family are of the ho|nour of an alliance with you; nor how exceedingly earne&s;t the former is to make you all the reparation in his power.</P>
<P>I think, my dear cou&s;in, that you cannot now do bet|ter than to give him the honour of your hand. He &s;ays &s;uch ju&s;t and great things of your virtue, and &s;o heartily condemns him&s;elf, that I think there is great and honour|able room for your forgiving him: And the more, as it &s;eems you are determined again&s;t a legal pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Your effectual forgivene&s;s of him, it is evident to me, will accelerate a general reconciliation: For, at pre&s;ent, my other cou&s;ins cannot per&s;uade them&s;elves, that he is in earne&s;t to do you ju&s;tice; or that you would refu&s;e him, if you believed he was.</P>
<P>But, my dear cou&s;in, there may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;omething in this affair, to which I may be a &s;tranger. If there be, and you will acquaint me with it, all that a <HI>naturally</HI> warm heart can do in your behalf, &s;hall be done.</P>
<P>Nothing but my endeavour to &s;erve you here has hither|to prevented me from a&s;&s;uring you of this by word of mouth: For I long to &s;ee you, after &s;o many years ab|&s;ence. I hope I &s;hall be able, in my next vi&s;its to my &s;everal cou&s;ins, to &s;et all right. Proud &s;pirits, when con|vinced that they have carried re&s;entments too high, want but a good excu&s;e to conde&s;cend: And parents mu&s;t <HI>al|ways</HI> love the child they <HI>once</HI> loved.</P>
<P>Mean while, I beg the favour of a few lines, to know if you have rea&s;on to doubt Mr. Lovelace's &s;incerity. For my part, I can have none, if I am to judge from the con|ver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed ye&s;terday between him and me, in pre&s;ence of Lord M.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to direct for me at your uncle An|tony's.</P>
<P>Permit me, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, till I can procure a happy reconciliation between you and your father, and brother, and uncles, to &s;upply the place to you of all tho&s;e near re|lations, as well as that of</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, Aug.</HI> 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I MOST heartily congratulate you, dear Sir, on your return to your native country.</P>
<P>I heard with much plea&s;ure that you were come; but I was both afraid and a&s;hamed, till you encouraged me by a fir&s;t notice, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you.</P>
<P>How con&s;oling is it to my wounded heart to find, that you have not been carried away by that tide of re&s;ent|ment and di&s;plea&s;ure, with which I have been &s;o unhap|pily overwhelmed&mdash;But that, while my &s;till nearer rela|tions have not thought fit to examine into the truth of vile reports rai&s;ed again&s;t me, you have informed your&s;elf (and generou&s;ly <HI>credited</HI> the information), that my error was owing more to my misfortune than my fault.</P>
<P>I have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt Mr. Lovelace's &s;in|cerity in his offers of marriage: Nor that all his relations are heartily de&s;irous of ranking me among them. I have had noble in&s;tances of their e&s;teem for me, on their appre|hending that my father's di&s;plea&s;ure mu&s;t have &s;ubjected me to difficulties: And this, after I had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed <HI>their</HI> pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations in their kin&s;man's favour, as well as <HI>his own.</HI></P>
<P>Nor think me, my dear cou&s;in, blameable for refu&s;ing him. I had given Mr. Lovelace no rea&s;on to think me a weak creature. If I <HI>had,</HI> a man of his character might have thought him&s;elf warranted to endeavour to make ungene|rous advantage of the weakne&s;s he had been able to in&s;pire. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>my own</HI> weakne&s;s (in that ca&s;e) might have brought me to a compo&s;ition with <HI>his</HI> wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>I can indeed forgive him. But that is, becau&s;e I think his crimes have &s;et me above him. Can I be above the man, Sir, to whom I &s;hall give my hand and my vows; and with them a &s;anction to the mo&s;t premeditated ba&s;ene&s;s? No, Sir, let me &s;ay, that your cou&s;in Clari&s;&s;a, were &s;he likely to live many years, and <HI>that</HI> (if &s;he married not this man) in penury and want, de&s;pi&s;ed and for&s;aken by all her friends, puts not &s;o high a value upon the conveniencies of
<PB N="123" REF="124">
life, nor upon life it&s;elf, as to &s;eek to re-obtain the one, or to pre&s;erve the other, by giving <HI>&s;uch</HI> a &s;anction: A &s;anction, which (<HI>were &s;he to perform her duty</HI>) would reward the vio|later.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;o much from Pride, as from Principle, that I &s;ay this. What, Sir, when Virtue, when Cha&s;tity is the crown of a woman, and particularly of a Wife, &s;hall your cou&s;in &s;toop to marry the man who could not form an at|tempt upon <HI>hers,</HI> but upon a pre&s;umption, that &s;he was ca|pable of receiving his offered hand, when he had found him|&s;elf mi&s;taken in the vile opinion he had conceived of her? Hitherto he has not had rea&s;on to think me weak. Nor will I give him an in&s;tance &s;o flagrant, that weak I am, in a point in which it would be criminal to be <HI>found</HI> weak.</P>
<P>One day, Sir, you will perhaps know all my &s;tory. But, whenever it is known, I beg, that the author of my cala|mities may not be vindictively &s;ought after. He could not have been the author of them, but for a &s;trange concur|rence of unhappy cau&s;es. As the Law will not be able to reach him when I am gone, any other &s;ort of vengeance terrifies me but to think of it: For, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;hould my friends be <HI>&s;afe,</HI> what honour would his death bring to my memory? If any of them &s;hould come to misfortune, how would my fault be aggravated!</P>
<P>God long pre&s;erve you, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, and ble&s;s you but in <HI>proportion</HI> to the con&s;olation you have given me, in letting me know that you &s;till love me; and that I have One near and dear relation who can pity and forgive me (and then will you be <HI>greatly</HI> ble&s;&s;ed); is the prayer of</P>

<P>I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that if a woman of her character, at &s;uch a critical time, is to be ju&s;tified in &s;uch a deception, a man in full health and vigour of body and mind, as I am, may be excu&s;ed for all his &s;tratagems and attempts again&s;t her. And, thank my &s;tars, I can now &s;it me down with a quiet con&s;cience on that &s;core. By my &s;oul, I can, Jack. Nor has any-body, who can acquit <HI>her,</HI> a right to blame <HI>me.</HI> But with &s;ome, indeed, every-thing <HI>&s;he</HI> does mu&s;t be good, every-thing <HI>I</HI> do mu&s;t be bad&mdash;And why? Becau&s;e &s;he has always taken care to coax the &s;tupid misjudging world, like a <HI>woman:</HI> While I have con&s;tantly defied and de&s;pi&s;ed its cen&s;ures, like a <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding all, you may let her know from me, that I will <HI>not</HI> mole&s;t her, &s;ince my vi&s;its would be &s;o &s;hocking to her: And I hope &s;he will take this into her con&s;ideration, as a piece of genero&s;ity, that &s;he could har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly expect, after the deception &s;he has put upon me. And let her further know, that if there be any-thing in my power, that will contribute either to her ea&s;e or honour, I will obey her, at the very fir&s;t intimation, however di&s;graceful or de|trimental to my&s;elf. All this, to make her unapprehen|&s;ive, and that &s;he may have nothing to pull her back.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="126">If her cur&s;ed relations could be brought as chearfully to perform <HI>their</HI> parts, I'd an&s;wer life for life for her recovery.</P>
<P>But who, that has &s;o many ludicrous images rai&s;ed in his mind by thy aukward penitence, can forbear laughing at thee? Spare, I be&s;eech thee, dear Belford, for the future, all thy own a&s;pirations, if thou would&s;t not di&s;honour tho&s;e of an angel indeed.</P>
<P>When I came to that pa&s;&s;age, where thou &s;ay&s;t, that thou con&s;idere&s;t her <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>83.</HI></NOTE> as one &s;ent from heaven, to draw thee after her&mdash;for the heart of me, I could not for an hour put thee out of my head, in the attitude of Dame Elizabeth Carteret, on her monument in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey. If thou never ob&s;erved&s;t it, go thither on pur|po&s;e; and there wilt thou &s;ee this dame in effigie, with uplifted head and hand, the latter taken hold of by a Cu|pid every inch of &s;tone, one clum&s;y foot lifted up al&s;o, aiming, as the &s;culptor de&s;igned it, to a&s;cend; but &s;o exe|cuted, as would rather make one imagine, that the figure (without &s;hoe or &s;tocken, as it is, tho' the re&s;t of the body is robed) was looking up to its corn-cutter: The other riveted to its native earth, bemired, like thee (<HI>immer&s;ed</HI> thou call|e&s;t it), beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of un&s;ticking it&s;elf. Both fi|gures, thou wilt find, &s;eem to be in a contention, the big|ger, whether it &s;hould pull down the le&s;&s;er about its ears&mdash;the le&s;&s;er (a chubby fat little varlet, of a fourth part of the other's bigne&s;s, with wings not much larger than tho&s;e of a butterfly) whether it &s;hould rai&s;e the larger to a heaven it points to, hardly big enough to contain the great toes of either.</P>
<P>Thou wilt &s;ay, perhaps, that the dame's figure in <HI>&s;tone</HI> may do credit, in the compari&s;on, to thine, both in grain and &s;hape, <HI>wooden</HI> as thou art all over. But that the lady, who, in every-thing but in the trick &s;he has played me &s;o lately, is truly an angel, is but &s;orrily repre&s;ented by the fat flank'd Cupid. This I allow thee. But yet there is enough in thy a&s;pirations, to &s;trike my mind with a re&s;emblance of thee and the lady to the figures on the wretched monument; for thou oughte&s;t to remember, that, prepared as &s;he may be to mount to her native &s;kies, it is impo&s;&s;ible for her to draw after her a heavy fellow, who has &s;o much to repent of, and amend.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="127">But now, to be &s;erious once more, let me tell you, Bel|ford, that, if the lady be really &s;o ill as you write &s;he is, it will become you (<HI>No Roman &s;tyle here!</HI>) in a ca&s;e &s;o very affecting, to be a little le&s;s pointed and &s;arca&s;tic in your reflections. For, upon my &s;oul, the matter begins to grate me mo&s;t confoundedly.</P>
<P>I am now &s;o impatient to hear oftener of her, that I take the hint accidentally given me by our two fellows meeting at Slough, and re&s;olve to go to our friend Doleman's at Ux|bridge; who&s;e wife and &s;i&s;ter, as well as he, have &s;o fre|quently pre&s;&s;ed me to give them my company for a week or two: There &s;hall I be within two hours ride, if any|thing &s;hould happen to induce her to &s;ee me: For it will well become her piety, and avowed charity, &s;hould the wor&s;t happen [The Lord of heaven and earth, however, avert that wor&s;t!] to give me that pardon from her <HI>lips,</HI> which &s;he has not denied me by <HI>pen and ink.</HI> And as &s;he wi&s;hes my reformation, &s;he knows not what good effects &s;uch an interview may have upon me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall accordingly be at Doleman's to morrow morn|ing, by eleven at furthe&s;t. My fellow will find me there at his return from you (with a letter, I hope). I &s;hall have Joel with me likewi&s;e, that I may &s;end the oftener, as matters fall out. Were I to be <HI>&s;till nearer,</HI> or in town, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to with-hold my&s;elf from &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>But, if the wor&s;t happen!&mdash;as, by your continual knell|ing, I know not what to think of it!&mdash;(Yet, once more, Heaven avert that wor&s;t!&mdash;How natural is it to pray, when one cannot help one's &s;elf!)&mdash;THEN &s;ay not, in &s;o many dreadful words, what the event is&mdash;Only, that you advi&s;e me to take a trip to Paris: And that will &s;tab me to the heart.</P>
<P>I SO well approve of your genero&s;ity to poor Belton's &s;i&s;ter, that I have made Mowbray give up his legacy, as I do mine, towards her India Bonds. When I come to town, Tourville &s;hall do the like; and we will buy each a ring, to wear in memory of the hone&s;t fellow, with our own money, that we may perform <HI>his</HI> will, as well as our <HI>own.</HI></P>
<P>My fellow rides the re&s;t of the night. I charge you, Jack, if you would &s;ave his life, that you &s;end him not back empty-handed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day night, Aug.</HI> 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I concluded my la&s;t, I hoped, that my next attendance upon this &s;urpri&s;ing lady would furni&s;h me with &s;ome particulars as agreeable as now could be hoped for from the declining way &s;he is in, by rea&s;on of the welcome letter &s;he had received from her cou&s;in Mor|den. But it proved quite otherwi&s;e to <HI>me,</HI> tho' not to <HI>her|&s;elf</HI>; for I think I never was more &s;hocked in my life than on the occa&s;ion I &s;hall mention pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>When I attended her about &s;even in the evening, &s;he told me, that &s;he had found her&s;elf &s;ince I went in a very petulant way. Strange, &s;he &s;aid, that the plea&s;ure &s;he had received from her cou&s;in's letter &s;hould have had &s;uch an effect upon her. But &s;he had given way to a <HI>com|parative</HI> humour, as &s;he might call it, and thought it very hard, that her nearer relations had not taken the methods with her, which her cou&s;in Morden had begun with; by inquiring into her merit or demerit, and giving her cau&s;e a fair audit before condemnation.</P>
<P>She had hardly &s;aid this, when &s;he &s;tarted, and a blu&s;h over&s;pread her face, on hearing, as I al&s;o did, a &s;ort of lumbering noi&s;e upon the &s;tairs, as if a large trunk were bringing up between two people: And, looking upon me with an eye of concern, Blunderers! &s;aid &s;he, they have brought in &s;omething two hours before the time.&mdash;Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed, Sir: It is all to &s;ave <HI>you</HI> trouble.</P>
<P>Before I could &s;peak, in came Mrs. Smith: O Ma|dam, &s;aid &s;he, What have you done?&mdash;Mrs. Lovick, en|tering, made the &s;ame exclamation. Lord have mercy upon me, Madam, cry'd I, what have you done!&mdash;For, &s;he &s;tepping at the in&s;tant to the door, the women told me, it was a coffin.&mdash;O Lovelace! that thou had&s;t been there at the moment!&mdash;Thou, the cau&s;er of all the&s;e &s;hocking &s;cenes! Surely thou could&s;t not have been le&s;s affected than I, who have no guilt, as to <HI>her,</HI> to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>With an intrepidity of a piece with the preparation, having directed them to carry it into her bedchamber, &s;he
<PB N="128" REF="129">
returned to us: They were not to have brought it in till after dark, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Pray, excu&s;e me, Mr. Belford: And don't you, Mrs. Lovick, be concerned: Nor you, Mrs. Smith. Why &s;hould you? There is nothing more in it, than the unu&s;ualne&s;s of the thing. Why may we not be as rea&s;onably &s;hocked at going to the church where are the monuments of our ance&s;tors, with who&s;e du&s;t we even <HI>hope</HI> our du&s;t &s;hall be one day mingled, as to be moved at &s;uch a &s;ight as this?</P>
<P>We all remaining &s;ilent, the women having their aprons at their eyes&mdash;Why this concern for nothing at all, &s;aid &s;he?&mdash;If I am to be blamed for any-thing, it is for &s;hewing too much &s;olicitude, as it may be thought, for this earthly part. I love to do every-thing for my&s;elf that I can do. I ever did. Every other material point is &s;o far done and taken care of, that I have had <HI>lei&s;ure</HI> for things of le&s;&s;er moment. Minutene&s;&s;es may be ob&s;erved, where greater articles are not neglected for them. I might have had this to order, perhaps, when le&s;s fit to order it. I have no mother, no &s;i&s;ter, no Mrs. Norton, no Mi&s;s Howe, near me. Some of you mu&s;t have &s;een <HI>this</HI> in a few days, if not now; perhaps have had the friendly trouble of direct|ing it. And what is the difference of a few days to <HI>you,</HI> when <HI>I</HI> am gratified, rather than di&s;compo&s;ed by it?&mdash;I &s;hall not die the &s;ooner for &s;uch a preparation.&mdash;Should not every-body make their will, that has any-thing to be|queath? And who, that makes a will, &s;hould be afraid of a coffin?&mdash;My dear friends (to the women), I have con|&s;idered the&s;e things; do not give me rea&s;on to think <HI>you</HI> have not, with &s;uch an object before you, as you have had in <HI>me,</HI> for weeks.</P>
<P>How rea&s;onable was all this!&mdash;It &s;hewed, indeed, that, &s;he her&s;elf had well con&s;idered of it. But yet we could not help being &s;hocked at the thoughts of the coffin thus brought in: The lovely per&s;on before our eyes, who is in all likelihood &s;o &s;oon to fill it.</P>
<P>We were all &s;ilent &s;till, the women in grief, I in a man|ner &s;tunned. She would not a&s;k <HI>me,</HI> &s;he &s;aid; but would be glad, &s;ince it had thus earlier than &s;he had intended been brought in, that her two good friends would walk in and look upon it. They would be le&s;s &s;hocked, when it was
<PB N="129" REF="130">
made more familiar to their eye, than while their thoughts ran large upon it. Don't you lead back, &s;aid &s;he, a &s;tart|ing &s;teed to the object he is apt to &s;tart at, in order to fa|miliarize him to it, and cure his &s;tarting? The &s;ame rea|&s;on will hold in this ca&s;e. Come, my good friends, I will lead you in.</P>
<P>I took my leave; telling her &s;he had done wrong, very wrong; and ought not, by any means, to have &s;uch an object before her.</P>
<P>The women followed her in.&mdash;'Tis a &s;trange Sex! No|thing is too &s;hocking for them to look upon, or &s;ee acted, that has but Novelty and Curio&s;ity in it.</P>
<P>Down I po&s;ted; got a chair; and was carried home, extremely &s;hocked and di&s;compo&s;ed: Yet, weighing the lady's arguments, I know not why I was &s;o affected&mdash;ex|cept, as &s;he &s;aid, at the unu&s;ualne&s;s of the thing.</P>
<P>While I waited for a chair, Mrs. Smith came down, and told me, that there were devices and in&s;criptions upon the lid. Lord ble&s;s me! Is a coffin a proper &s;ubject to di&s;|play fancy upon?&mdash;But the&s;e great minds cannot avoid do|ing extraordinary things!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. Mr. <HI>BELFORD,</HI> To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday Morn. Sept.</HI> 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is &s;urpri&s;ing, that I, a <HI>man,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o much affected as I was, at &s;uch an object as is the &s;ubject of my for|mer letter; who al&s;o, in my late uncle's ca&s;e, and poor Belton's, had the like before me, and the directing of it: When &s;he, a <HI>woman,</HI> of &s;o weak and tender a frame, who was to fill it (&s;o &s;oon, perhaps, to fill it!) could give orders about it, and draw out the devices upon it, and explain them with &s;o little concern as the women tell me &s;he did to them la&s;t night, after I was gone.</P>
<P>I really was ill, and re&s;tle&s;s all night. Thou wert the &s;ubject of my execration, as &s;he of my admiration, all the time I was quite awake: And, when I dozed, I dreamt of nothing but of flying hour-gla&s;&s;es, deaths heads, &s;pades, mattocks, and Eternity; the hint of her devices (as given me by Mrs. Smith) running in my head.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="131">However, not being able to keep away from Smith's, I went thither about &s;even. The lady was ju&s;t gone out: She had &s;lept better, I found, than I, tho' her &s;olemn repo|&s;itory was under her window not far from her bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>I was prevailed upon by Mrs. Smith and her nur&s;e Shel|burne (Mrs. Lovick being abroad with her) to go up and look at the devices. Mrs. Lovick has &s;ince &s;hewn me a copy of the draught by which all was ordered. And I will give thee a &s;ketch of the &s;ymbols.</P>
<P>The principal device, neatly etched on a plate of white metal, is a crowned &s;erpent, with its tail in its mouth, forming a ring, the emblem of Eternity, and in the circle made by it is this in&s;cription:</P>
<Q><P>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</P>
<P>APRIL X.</P>
<P>[Then the year]</P>
<P>AETAT. XIX.</P></Q>
<P>For ornaments: At top, an hour-gla&s;s winged. At bottom, an urn.</P>
<P>Under the hour-gla&s;s, on another plate this in&s;cription:
<Q><P><HI>HERE</HI> the wicked cea&s;e from troubling: And <HI>HERE</HI> the weary be at re&s;t.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Job iii.17.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Over the urn, near the bottom:
<Q><P>Turn again unto thy re&s;t, O my &s;oul! For the Lord hath rewarded thee: And why? Thou ha&s;t delivered my &s;oul from death; mine eyes from tears; and my feet from falling.</P>
<BIBL><HI>P&s;. cxvi.7, 8.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Over this text is the head of a white lily &s;napt &s;hort off, and ju&s;t falling from the &s;talk; and this in&s;cription over that, between the principal plate and the lily:
<Q><P>The days of man are but as gra&s;s. For he flouri&s;heth as a flower of the field: For, as &s;oon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; and the place thereof &s;hall know it no more.</P>
<BIBL><HI>P&s;. ciii.15, 16.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>She excu&s;ed her&s;elf to the women, on the &s;core of her youth, and being u&s;ed to draw for her needleworks, for having &s;hewn more fancy than would perhaps be thought &s;uitable on &s;o &s;olemn an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The date, April 10. &s;he accounted for, as not being able
<PB N="131" REF="132">
to tell what her clo&s;ing-day would be; and as That was the fatal day of her leaving her father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She di&s;charged the undertaker's bill, after I was gone, with as much chearfulne&s;s as &s;he could ever have paid for the cloaths &s;he &s;old to purcha&s;e this her <HI>palace:</HI> For &s;uch the called it; reflecting upon her&s;elf for the expen&s;ivene&s;s of it, &s;aying, That they might ob&s;erve in <HI>her,</HI> that pride left not poor mortals to the la&s;t: But indeed &s;he did not know but her father would permit it, when furni&s;hed, to be carried down to be depo&s;ited with her ance&s;tors; and, in that ca&s;e, &s;he ought not to di&s;credit them in her <HI>la&s;t ap|pearance.</HI></P>
<P>It is covered with fine black cloth, and lined with white &s;atten; &s;oon, &s;he &s;aid, to be tarni&s;hed by viler earth than any it could be covered by.</P>
<P>The burial-dre&s;s was brought home with it. The wo|men had curio&s;ity enough, I &s;uppo&s;e, to &s;ee her open That, if &s;he did open it.&mdash;And, perhaps, thou would&s;t have been glad to have been pre&s;ent, to have admired it too!</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick &s;aid, &s;he took the liberty to blame her; and wi&s;hed the removal of &s;uch an object&mdash;from her <HI>bed|chamber,</HI> at lea&s;t: And was &s;o affected with the noble an|&s;wer &s;he made upon it, that &s;he entered it down, the mo|ment &s;he left her.</P>
<P>To per&s;ons in health, &s;aid &s;he, this &s;ight may be &s;hock|ing; and the preparation, and my unconcernedne&s;s in it, may appear affected: But to me, who have had &s;o gradual a weaning-time from the world, and &s;o much rea&s;on not to love it, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I dwell on, I indulge (and, &s;trictly &s;peaking, I enjoy) the thoughts of death. For, believe me (looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the awful receptacle): Believe what at this in&s;tant I feel to be mo&s;t true, That there is &s;uch a va&s;t &s;uperiority of weight and importance in the thought of death, and its hoped for happy con&s;equences, that it in a manner annihilates all other con&s;iderations and concerns. Believe me, my good friends, it does what nothing el&s;e can do; It teaches me, by &s;trengthening in me the force of the divine&s;t example, to forgive the injuries I have re|ceived; and &s;huts out the remembrance of pa&s;t evils from my &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">And now let me a&s;k thee, Lovelace, Do&s;t thou think, that, when the time &s;hall come that thou &s;halt be obliged to launch into the boundle&s;s ocean of Eternity, thou wilt be able (any more than poor Belton was) to act thy part with &s;uch true heroi&s;m, as this &s;weet and tender blo&s;&s;om of a woman has manife&s;ted, and continues to manife&s;t!</P>
<P>O no! it cannot be!&mdash;And why cannot it be?&mdash;The rea&s;on is evident: She has no wilful errors to look back upon with &s;elf-reproach&mdash;and her mind is &s;trengthened by the con&s;olations which flow from that religious rectitude which has been the guide of all her actions; and which has taught her rather to choo&s;e to be a &s;ufferer, than an aggre&s;&s;or!</P>
<P>This was the &s;upport of the divine Socrates, as thou ha&s;t read. When led to execution, his wife lamenting that he &s;hould &s;uffer being innocent, Thou fool, &s;aid he, would&s;t thou wi&s;h me to be guilty?</P>

<P>I COULD not clo&s;e my letter in &s;uch an uncertainty as mu&s;t have added to your impatience. For you have, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, convinced me, that the &s;u&s;pen&s;e you love to <HI>give</HI> would be the greate&s;t torment to you that you could <HI>receive.</HI> A common ca&s;e with all aggre&s;&s;ive and violent &s;pirits, I believe. I will ju&s;t mention then (your &s;ervant waiting here till I have written), that the lady has had two very &s;evere fits: In the la&s;t of which, whil&s;t &s;he lay, they &s;ent to the doctor, and Mr. Goddard, who both advi&s;ed, that a me&s;&s;enger &s;hould be di&s;patched for me, as her executor; being doubtful, whether, if &s;he had a third, it would not carry her off.</P>
<P>She was tolerably recovered by the time I came; and the doctor made her promi&s;e before me, that &s;he would not attempt any more, while &s;o weak, to go abroad; for, by Mrs. Lovick's de&s;cription, who attended her, the &s;hort|ne&s;s of her breath, her extreme weakne&s;s, and the fervor of her devotions when at church, were contraries, which, pulling different ways (the &s;oul a&s;piring, the body &s;inking) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore her tender frame in pieces.</P>
<P>So much for the pre&s;ent. I &s;hall detain Will. no longer, than ju&s;t to beg, that you will &s;end me back this pacquet, and the la&s;t.

<P>A letter from Mi&s;s Howe is ju&s;t now brought by a par|ticular me&s;&s;enger, who &s;ays he mu&s;t carry back a few lines in return. But, as the lady is ju&s;t retired to lie down, the man is to call again by-and-by.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. Mr. <HI>LOVELACE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Uxbridge,</HI>
<DATE><HI>Sept.</HI> 1. <HI>twelve o' clock at night.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you the papers with this. You mu&s;t account to me hone&s;tly and fairly when I &s;ee you for the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s with which you write for them. And then al&s;o will we talk about the contents of your la&s;t di&s;patch, and about &s;ome of your &s;evere and unfriendly reflections.</P>
<P>Mean time, whatever thou do&s;t, don't let the wonder|ful creature leave us! Set before her the &s;in of her prepa|ration, as if &s;he thought &s;he could depart when &s;he plea&s;ed. She'll per&s;uade her&s;elf, at this rate, that &s;he has nothing to do, when all is ready, but to lie down, and go to &s;leep: And &s;uch a lively fancy as hers will make a reality of a je&s;t at any time.</P>
<P>A <HI>je&s;t,</HI> I call all that has pa&s;&s;ed between her and me; a mere je&s;t to die for!&mdash;For has &s;he not, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, infinitely more triumphed over me, than &s;uffered from me?</P>
<P>Would the &s;acred regard I have for her purity, even for her <HI>per&s;onal</HI> as well as <HI>intellectual</HI> purity, permit, I could prove this as clear as the &s;un. Therefore tell the dear creature, &s;he mu&s;t not be wicked in her piety. There is a <HI>too much,</HI> as well as a <HI>too little,</HI> even in righteou&s;ne&s;s. Perhaps &s;he does not think of that.&mdash;O that &s;he would have permitted my attendance, as obligingly as &s;he does of thine!&mdash;The dear &s;oul u&s;ed to love humour. I remember the time that &s;he knew how to &s;mile at a piece of apropos humour. And, let me tell thee, a &s;mile upon the lips mu&s;t have had its corre&s;pondent chearfulne&s;&s;es in a heart &s;o &s;incere as hers.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136">Tell the doctor, I will make over all my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and all my rever&s;ions, to him, if he will but prolong her life for one twelvemonth to come. But for one twelve|month, Jack!&mdash;He will lo&s;e all his reputation with me, and I &s;hall treat him as Belton did his doctor, if he cannot do this for me, on &s;o young a &s;ubject. But <HI>Nineteen,</HI> Bel|ford!&mdash;<HI>Nineteen</HI> cannot &s;o &s;oon die of grief, if the doctor de&s;erve that name; and &s;o blooming and &s;o fine a con&s;ti|tution as &s;he had but three or four months ago!</P>
<P>But what need the doctor have a&s;ked her leave to write to her friends? Could he not have done it, without letting her know any-thing of the matter? That was one of the likelie&s;t means that could be thought of, to bring &s;ome of them about her, &s;ince &s;he is &s;o de&s;irous to &s;ee them. At lea&s;t, it would have induced them to &s;end up her favourite Norton. But the&s;e plaguy &s;olemn fellows are great traders in parade: And, for the hearts of them, can|not get out of it, be the occa&s;ion what it will. They'll cram down your throat their poi&s;onous drugs by whole&s;ale, without a&s;king you a que&s;tion; and have the a&s;&s;urance to <HI>own</HI> it to be <HI>pre&s;cribing:</HI> But, when they are to do good, they are to a&s;k your con&s;ent.</P>
<P>How the dear creature's character ri&s;es in every line of thy letters!&mdash;But it is owing to the uncommon occa&s;ions &s;he has met with that &s;he blazes out upon us with &s;uch a meridian lu&s;tre!&mdash;How, but for tho&s;e occa&s;ions, could her noble &s;entiments, her prudent con&s;ideration, her forgiving &s;pirit, her exalted benevolence, and her equanimity in view of the mo&s;t &s;hocking pro&s;pects (which &s;et her in a light &s;o &s;uperior to all her &s;ex, and even to the philo&s;o|phers of antiquity) have been manife&s;ted?</P>
<P>I know thou wilt think I am going to claim &s;ome me|rit to my&s;elf, for having given her &s;uch opportunities of &s;ignalizing her virtues. But I am not; for, if I did, I mu&s;t &s;hare that merit with her implacable relations, who would ju&s;tly be intitled to <HI>two thirds</HI> of it, at lea&s;t: And my &s;oul di&s;dains a partner&s;hip in any-thing with &s;uch a family.</P>
<P>But this I mention as an an&s;wer to thy reproaches, that I could be &s;o little edified by perfections, to which, thou &s;uppo&s;e&s;t, I was for &s;o long together daily and hourly a per&s;onal witne&s;s&mdash;When, admirable as &s;he was in all &s;he
<PB N="136" REF="137">
&s;aid, and in all &s;he did, occa&s;ion had not at that time ri|pened, and called forth, tho&s;e amazing perfections which now a&s;toni&s;h and confound me.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that I admire her more than ever I did; and that my love for her is le&s;s <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> as I may &s;ay, more <HI>intellectual,</HI> than ever I thought it could be to woman.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o it is, that I am confident (would it plea&s;e the Fates to &s;pare her, and make her mine) I could love her with a purity that would draw on <HI>my own</HI> FUTURE, as well as in&s;ure <HI>her</HI> TEMPORAL happine&s;s.&mdash;And hence, by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, &s;hall I be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all men, if I am deprived of her.</P>
<P>Thou &s;everely reflecte&s;t upon me for my levity in the Abbey in&s;tance. And I will be ingenuous enough to own, that as thou &s;ee&s;t not my heart, there may be pa&s;&s;ages in every one of my letters, which (the melancholy occa&s;ion con&s;idered) de&s;erve thy mo&s;t pointed rebukes. But, faith, Jack, thou art &s;uch a tragi-comical mortal, with thy leaden a&s;pirations at one time, and thy flying hour-gla&s;&s;es and dreaming terrors at another, that, as Prior &s;ays, <HI>What &s;erious is, thou turn'&s;t to farce</HI>; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep within the bounds of decorum or gravity, when one reads what thou write&s;t.</P>
<P>But to re&s;train my&s;elf (for my con&s;titutional gaiety was ready to run away with me again) I will repeat, I mu&s;t ever repeat, that I am mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly affected with the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e: And, were this paragon actu|ally to quit the world, &s;hould never enjoy my&s;elf one hour together, tho' I were to live to the age of Methu&s;a|lem.</P>
<P>Indeed it is to this <HI>deep concern,</HI> that my very <HI>levity</HI> is owing: For I &s;truggle and &s;truggle, and try to buffet down the&s;e reflections as they ri&s;e; and when I cannot do it, I am forced, as I have often &s;aid, to try to make my|&s;elf laugh, that I may not cry; for one or other I mu&s;t do: And is it not philo&s;ophy carried to the highe&s;t pitch, for a man to conquer &s;uch tumults of &s;oul as I am &s;ome|times agitated by, and, in the very height of the &s;torm, to be able to quaver out an hor&s;e-laugh?</P>
<P>Your Seneca's, your Epictetus's, and the re&s;t of your &s;toical tribe, with all their apathy-non&s;en&s;e, could not
<PB N="137" REF="138">
come up to this. They could <HI>forbear</HI> wry faces: Bodily pains they could well enough <HI>&s;eem</HI> to &s;upport; and that was all: But the pangs of their own &s;mitten-down &s;ouls they could not <HI>laugh</HI> over, tho' they could at the follies of others. They read grave lectures; but they <HI>were</HI> grave. This high point of philo&s;ophy, to laugh and be merry in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;oul-harrowing woes, when the heart-&s;trings are ju&s;t bur&s;ting a&s;under, was re&s;erved for thy Love|lace.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething owing to con&s;titution, I own; and that this is the laughing-time of my life. For what a woe mu&s;t that be, which for an hour together can mortify a man of &s;ix or &s;even and twenty, in high blood and &s;pirits, of a naturally gay di&s;po&s;ition, who can &s;ing, dance, and &s;crib|ble, and take and give delight in them all?&mdash;But then my grief, as my joy, is &s;harper-pointed than mo&s;t other mens; and, like what Dolly Welby once told me, de&s;cribing the parturient throes, if there were not lucid intervals&mdash;if they did not come and go&mdash;there would be no bearing them.</P>
<P>AFTER all, as I am &s;o little di&s;tant from the dear crea|ture, and as &s;he is &s;o very ill, I think I cannot excu&s;e my|&s;elf from making her <HI>one</HI> vi&s;it. Neverthele&s;s, if I thought her &s;o near&mdash;(What word &s;hall I u&s;e, that my &s;oul is not &s;hocked at!) and that &s;he would be <HI>too much di&s;com|po&s;ed</HI> by a vi&s;it; I would not think of it.&mdash;Yet how can I bear the recollection, that, when &s;he la&s;t went from me (her innocence &s;o triumphant over my premeditated guilt, as was enough to reconcile her to life, and to &s;et her above the &s;en&s;e of injuries &s;o nobly &s;u&s;tained) that &s;he &s;hould then depart with an incurable fracture in her heart; and that <HI>that</HI> &s;hould be the la&s;t time I &s;hould ever &s;ee her!&mdash;How, how can I bear this reflection!</P>
<P>O Jack! how my con&s;cience, that gives edge even to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hy blunt reflections, tears me!&mdash;Even this moment would I give the world to pu&s;h the cruel reproacher from me by one gay intervention!&mdash;Sick of my&s;elf!&mdash;Sick of the re|membrance of my vile plots; and of my <HI>light,</HI> my <HI>mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary</HI> ec&s;ta&s;y (Villainous burglar, felon, thief, that I was!) which has brought upon me &s;uch <HI>durable</HI> and &s;uch <HI>heavy</HI>

remor&s;e! what would I give that I had not been guilty of &s;uch barbarous and ungrateful perfidy to the mo&s;t ex|cellent of God's creatures!</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;ome little plea&s;ure given me by thine, ju&s;t now brought me. I &s;ee now, that thou ha&s;t a little humanity left. Would to heaven, for the dear lady's &s;ake, as well as for thy own, that thou had&s;t romaged it up from all the dark forgotten corners of thy &s;oul a little &s;ooner!</P>
<P>The lady is alive, and &s;erene, and calm, and has all her noble intellects clear and &s;trong: But Nineteen will not however &s;ave her. She &s;ays, &s;he will now content her&s;elf with her clo&s;et-duties, and the vi&s;its of the pari&s;h-mini&s;ter; and will not attempt to go out. Nor, indeed, will &s;he, I am afraid, ever walk up or down a pair of &s;tairs again.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry at my &s;oul to have this to &s;ay: But it would be a folly to flatter thee.</P>
<P>As to thy &s;eeing her, I believe the lea&s;t hint of that &s;ort, now, would cut off &s;ome hours of her life.</P>
<P>What has contributed to her &s;erenity, it &s;eems, is, That, taking the alarm her fits gave her, &s;he has intirely fini&s;hed, and &s;igned and &s;ealed, her la&s;t will: Which &s;he had defer|red doing till this time, in hopes, as &s;he &s;aid, of &s;ome good news from Harlowe-Place; which would have occa|&s;ioned the alteration of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe's letter was not given her till four in the af|ternoon, ye&s;terday; at what time the me&s;&s;enger returned for an an&s;wer. She admitted him to her pre&s;ence in the dining-room, ill as &s;he then was; and would have written a few lines, as de&s;ired by Mi&s;s Howe; but, not being able to hold a pen, &s;he bid the me&s;&s;enger tell her, that &s;he hoped to be well enough to write a long letter by the next day's po&s;t; and would not now detain him.</P>

<P>I CALLED ju&s;t now, and found the lady writing to Mi&s;s Howe. She made me a melancholy compliment, that &s;he &s;hewed me not Mi&s;s Howe's letter, becau&s;e I &s;hould &s;oon have that and all her papers before me. But &s;he told me, that Mi&s;s Howe had very con&s;iderately obviated to Colonel Morden &s;everal things which might have occa|&s;ioned mi&s;apprehen&s;ions between him and me; and had likewi&s;e put a lighter con&s;truction, for the &s;ake of peace, on &s;ome of your actions, than they de&s;erved.</P>
<P>She added, That her cou&s;in Morden was warmly en|gaged in her favour with her friends: And one good piece of news Mi&s;s Howe's letter contained; that her father would give up &s;ome matters, which (appertaining to her of right) would make my executor&s;hip the ea&s;ier in &s;ome particulars that had given her a little pain.</P>
<P>She owned &s;he had been obliged to leave off (in the let|ter &s;he was writing) thro' weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Will. &s;ays, he &s;hall reach you to-night. I &s;hall &s;end in the morning; and if I find her not wor&s;e, will ride to Edgware, and return in the afternoon.</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am at length returned to this place; and had intended to wait on you in London: But my mamma is very ill&mdash;Alas! my dear, &s;he is very ill indeed&mdash;And you are likewi&s;e very ill&mdash;I &s;ee <HI>that</HI> by yours of the 25th&mdash;What &s;hall I do, if I lo&s;e two &s;uch near, and dear, and tender friends? She was taken ill ye&s;terday at our la&s;t &s;tage in our return home&mdash;And has a violent &s;urfeit and fever, and the doctors are doubtful about her.</P>
<P>If &s;he &s;hould die, how will all my pertne&s;&s;es to her fly in my face!&mdash;Why, why, did I ever vex her?&mdash;She &s;ays I have been all duty and obedience!&mdash;She kindly forgets all my faults, and remembers every-thing I have been &s;o happy as to oblige her in. And this cuts me to the heart.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, I &s;ee, my dear, you are very bad&mdash;And I cannot bear it. Do, my beloved Mi&s;s Harlowe, if you <HI>can</HI> be

<P>MY mother, Heaven be prai&s;ed! has had a fine night, and is much better. Her fever has yielded to medicine! And now I can write once more with freedom and ea&s;e to you, in hopes that <HI>you</HI> al&s;o are better. If this be granted to my prayers, I &s;hall again be happy. I write with &s;till the more alacrity, as I have an opportunity given me to touch upon a &s;ubject in which you are nearly concerned.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, my dear, that your cou&s;in Mor|den has been here with me. He told me of an interview he had on Monday at Lord M's with Lovelace; and a&s;ked me abundance of que&s;tions about you, and about that villainous man.</P>
<P>I could have rai&s;ed a fine flame between them if I would: But, ob&s;erving that he is a man of very lively pa&s;&s;ions, and believing you would be mi&s;erable if any|thing &s;hould happen to him from a quarrel with a man who
<PB N="141" REF="142">
is known to have &s;o many advantages at his &s;word, I made not the wor&s;t of the &s;ubjects we talked of. But, as I could not tell untruths in his favour, you mu&s;t think I &s;aid enough to make him cur&s;e the wretch.</P>
<P>I don't find, well as they all u&s;ed to re&s;pect Colonel Morden, that he has influence enough upon them to bring them to any terms of reconciliation.</P>
<P>What can they mean by it!&mdash;But your brother is come home, it &s;eems: So, The honour of the hou&s;e&mdash;The re|putation of the family, is all the cry!</P>
<P>The Colonel is exceedingly out of humour with them all. Yet has he not hitherto, it &s;eems, &s;een your brutal brother.&mdash;I told him how ill you were, and communicated to him &s;ome of the contents of your letter. He admired <HI>you,</HI> cur&s;ed <HI>Lovelace,</HI> and raved again&s;t all your <HI>family.</HI>&mdash;He declared, that they were all unworthy of you.</P>
<P>At his earne&s;t reque&s;t, I permitted him to take &s;ome brief notes of &s;uch of the contents of your letter to me, as I thought I <HI>could</HI> read to him; and, particularly, of your melancholy conclu&s;ion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p <HI>67.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, That none of your friends think you &s;o ill as you are; nor will believe it.&mdash;He is &s;ure they all love you, and that dearly too.</P>
<P>If they do, their pre&s;ent hardne&s;s of heart will be the &s;ubject of everla&s;ting remor&s;e to them &s;hould you be taken from us&mdash;But now it &s;eems (barbarous wretches!) you are to <HI>&s;uffer within an inch of your life.</HI></P>
<P>He a&s;ked me que&s;tions about Mr. Belford: And when he had heard what I had to &s;ay of that gentleman, and his di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervices to you, he raved at &s;ome villainous &s;urmi&s;es thrown out again&s;t you by that officious pedant, Brand: Who, but for his gown, I find, would come off poorly enough between your cou&s;in and Lovelace.</P>
<P>He was &s;o unea&s;y about you him&s;elf, that on Thur&s;day the 24th he &s;ent-up an hone&s;t &s;erious man <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>37.</HI></NOTE>, one Al&s;ton, a gentleman farmer, to inquire of your condition, your vi&s;iters, &amp;c. who brought him word, that you was very ill, and was put to great &s;treights to &s;upport your&s;elf: But as this was told him by the gentlewoman of the hou&s;e where you lodge, who it &s;eems mingled with it &s;ome tart,

tho' de&s;erved, reflections upon your relations cruelty, it was not credited by them: And I my&s;elf hope it cannot be true; for &s;urely you could not be &s;o <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> I will &s;ay, to my friend&s;hip, as to &s;uffer any inconveniencies for want of money. I think I could not forgive you, if it were &s;o.</P>
<P>The Colonel (as one of your tru&s;tees) is re&s;olved to &s;ee you put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your e&s;tate: And, in the mean time, he has actually engaged them to remit to him, for you, the produce of it accrued &s;ince your grandfather's death (a very con&s;iderable &s;um); and propo&s;es him&s;elf to attend you with it. But, by a hint he dropt, I find you had di&s;appointed &s;ome people's littlene&s;s, by not writing to them for money and &s;upplies; &s;ince they were deter|mined to di&s;tre&s;s you, and to put you at defiance.</P>
<P>Like all the re&s;t!&mdash;I hope I may &s;ay that without offence.</P>
<P>Your cou&s;in imagines, that, before a reconciliation takes place, they will in&s;i&s;t, that you &s;hall make &s;uch a will, as to that e&s;tate, as they &s;hall approve of: But he declares, he will not go out of England till he has &s;een ju|&s;tice done you by <HI>every-body</HI>; and that you &s;hall not be im|po&s;ed on either by friend or foe&mdash;</P>
<P>By <HI>relation</HI> or foe, &s;hould he not have &s;aid?&mdash;For a friend will not impo&s;e upon a friend.</P>
<P>So, my dear, you are to <HI>buy your peace,</HI> if &s;ome people were to have their wills!</P>
<P>Your cou&s;in [not <HI>I,</HI> my dear, tho' it was always my opinion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>i.</HI> p. <HI>56.</HI></NOTE>] &s;ays, that the whole family is <HI>too rich</HI> to be either <HI>humble, con&s;iderate,</HI> or <HI>contented.</HI> And as for him&s;elf, he has an ample fortune, he &s;ays, and thinks of leaving it wholly to you.</P>
<P>Had this villain Lovelace con&s;ulted his worldly in|tere&s;t only, what a fortune would he have had in you, even altho' your marrying him had deprived you of your paternal &s;hare?</P>
<P>I am obliged to leave off here. But having a good deal &s;till to write, and my mother better, I will pur&s;ue the &s;ub|ject in another letter, altho' I &s;end both together. I need not &s;ay how much I am, and will ever be,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, Aug.</HI> 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Colonel thought fit once to &s;peak it to the prai&s;e of Lovelace's <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> that (<HI>as a man of honour ought</HI>) he took to him&s;elf all the blame, and acquitted you of the con&s;equences of the precipitate &s;tep you had taken; &s;ince, he &s;aid, as you loved him, and was in his power, he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have had advantages, which he would <HI>not</HI> have had, if you had continued at your father's, or at any friend's.</P>
<P><HI>Mighty generous,</HI> I &s;aid (were it as he &s;uppo&s;ed) in &s;uch in&s;olent reflecters, the be&s;t of them; who pretend to <HI>clear</HI> reputations, which never had been <HI>&s;ullied,</HI> but by falling into their dirty acquaintance! But in this ca&s;e, I added, that there was no need of any-thing but the &s;tricte&s;t truth, to demon&s;trate Lovelace to be the blacke&s;t of vil|lains, You the brighte&s;t of innocents.</P>
<P>This he catch'd at; and &s;wore, that could he find, that there were any-thing uncommon or barbarous in the &s;e|duction, as one of your letters had indeed &s;eemed to im|ply (That is to &s;ay, my dear, any-thing <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than per|jury, breach of faith, and abu&s;e of a generous confi|dence!&mdash;Sorry fellows!) he would avenge his cou&s;in to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>I urged your apprehen&s;ions on this he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d from your la&s;t letter to me: But he &s;eemed capable of taking what I know to be real greatne&s;s of &s;oul, in an unworthy &s;en&s;e: For he mentioned directly upon it, the expectation your friends had, that you &s;hould (previous to any reconcilia|tion with them) appear in a court of ju&s;tice again&s;t the villain&mdash;IF you could do it with the advantage to your|&s;elf that I hinted might be done.</P>
<P>And truly, if I would have heard him, he had indelicacy enough to have gone into the nature of the proof of the crime upon which they wanted to have Lovelace arraign|ed: Yet this is a gentleman improved by travel and learn|ing!&mdash;Upon my word, my dear, I, who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t delicate conver&s;ation ever &s;ince I
<PB N="144" REF="145">
had the honour to know you, de&s;pi&s;e this Sex, from the gentleman to the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I find that Mr. Morden has a very &s;lender notion of womens virtue, in particular ca&s;es: For which rea&s;on I put him down, tho' your favourite, as one who is not intitled <HI>to ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone.</HI></P>
<P>I never knew a man who de&s;erved to be well thought of him&s;elf for his morals, who had a &s;light opinion of the virtue of our Sex in general. For if from the <HI>difference</HI> of <HI>temperament</HI> and <HI>education,</HI> mode&s;ty, cha&s;tity, and piety too (and the&s;e from <HI>principle</HI>) are not to be found in our Sex preferably to the other, I &s;hould think it a &s;ign of a much wor&s;e nature in <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>He even hinted (as from your relations indeed) that it is impo&s;&s;ible but there mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>will</HI> where there is much <HI>love.</HI> The&s;e &s;ort of reflections are enough to make a woman, who has at heart her own honour and the ho|nour of her Sex, to look about her, and con&s;ider what &s;he is doing, when &s;he enters into an intimacy with the&s;e wretches; &s;ince it is plain, that whenever &s;he throws her|&s;elf into the power of a man, and leaves for him her pa|rents or guardians, every-body will believe it to be owing more to her good luck than to her di&s;cretion, if there be not an end of her virtue: And let the man be ever &s;uch a villain to her, &s;he mu&s;t take into her own bo&s;om a &s;hare of his guilty ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>I am writing to general ca&s;es. You, my dear, are out of the que&s;tion. Your &s;tory, as I have heretofore &s;aid, will afford a warning, as well as an example <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> IV. <HI>p.</HI> 21.</NOTE>: For who is it that will not infer, That if a per&s;on of your fortune, character, and merit, could not e&s;cape ruin, after &s;he had put her&s;elf into the power of her <HI>hyaena,</HI> what can a thoughtle&s;s, fond, giddy creature expect?</P>
<P>Every man, they will &s;ay, is not a LOVELACE.&mdash;True: But then, neither is every woman a CLARISSA.&mdash;And al|low for the one and the other, the example mu&s;t be of ge|neral u&s;e.</P>
<P>I prepared this gentleman to expect your appointment of Mr. Belford, for an office that we both hope he will have no occa&s;ion to act in (nor any-body el&s;e) for many, very many years to come. He was at fir&s;t &s;tartled at it:
<PB N="145" REF="146">
But, upon hearing your rea&s;ons, which had &s;atisfied me, he only &s;aid, That &s;uch an appointment, were it to take place, would exceedingly affect his other cou&s;ins.</P>
<P>He told me, he had a copy of Lovelace's letter to you, imploring your pardon, and offering to undergo any pe|nance to procure it <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>vi.</HI> p. <HI>346.</HI></NOTE>; and al&s;o of your an&s;wer to it <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>vi.</HI> p. <HI>356.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I find he is willing to hope, that a marriage between you may &s;till take place; which, he &s;ays, will heal up all breaches.</P>
<P>I would have written much more:&mdash;On the following particulars e&s;pecially; to wit, Of the wretched man's hunting you out of your lodgings: Of your relations &s;trange <HI>implacablene&s;s</HI> (I am in ha&s;te, and cannot think of a word you would like better, <HI>ju&s;t now):</HI> Of your la&s;t letter to Lovelace, to divert him from pur&s;uing you: Of your aunt Hervey's penitential conver&s;ation with Mrs. Norton: Of Mr. Wyerley's renewed addre&s;s: Of your le&s;&s;ons in Hickman's behalf, &s;o approveable, were the man more &s;o than he is: But indeed I am offended with him at this in&s;tant, and have been the&s;e two days:&mdash;Of your &s;i&s;ter's tran&s;portation-project:&mdash;And of twenty and twenty other things:&mdash;But am obliged to leave off, to attend my two cou&s;ins Spil&s;worth, and my cou&s;in Herbert, who are come to vi&s;it us on account of my mother's illne&s;s.&mdash;I will therefore di&s;patch the&s;e by Rogers; and if my mother gets well &s;oon (as I hope &s;he will) I am re&s;olved to &s;ee you in town, and tell you every-thing that now is upon my mind; and particularly, mingling my &s;oul with yours, how much I am, and will ever be, my deare&s;t dear friend,</P>

<P>Let Rogers bring one line, I pray you. I thought to have &s;ent him this afternoon; but he cannot &s;et out till to-morrow morning early.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. Mr. <HI>BELFORD,</HI> To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Evening, Sept.</HI> 3.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Wonder not at the impatience your &s;ervant tells me you expre&s;s to hear from me. I was de&s;igning to write you a long letter, and was ju&s;t returned from Smith's for that purpo&s;e; but, &s;ince you are &s;o urgent, you mu&s;t be contented with a &s;hort one.</P>
<P>I attended the lady this morning, ju&s;t before I &s;et out for Edgware. She was &s;o ill over-night, that &s;he was obliged to leave her letter to Mi&s;s Howe unfini&s;hed: But early this morning &s;he made an end of it, and had ju&s;t &s;ealed it up as I came. She was &s;o fatigued with writing, that &s;he told me &s;he would lie down after I was gone, and endeavour to recruit her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>They had &s;ent for Mr. Goddard, when &s;he was &s;o ill la&s;t night; and not being able to &s;ee him out of her own chamber, he, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw her <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> as &s;he calls it. He was extremely &s;hocked and concerned at it; and chid Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick for not per&s;uading her to have &s;uch an object removed from her bedchamber: And when they excu&s;ed them&s;elves on the <HI>little authority</HI> it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e they mu&s;t have with a lady &s;o much their &s;uperior, he reflected warmly on tho&s;e who had <HI>more</HI> authority, and who left her to proceed in &s;uch a &s;hocking and &s;olemn whim&s;y, as he called it.</P>
<P>It is placed near the window, like a harp&s;ichord, tho' covered over to the ground: And when &s;he is &s;o ill, that &s;he cannot well go to her clo&s;et, &s;he writes and reads upon it, as others would upon a de&s;k or table. But (only as &s;he was &s;o ill la&s;t night) &s;he choo&s;es not to &s;ee any-body in that apartment.</P>
<P>I went to Edgware; and, returning in the evening, at|tended her again. She had a letter brought her from Mrs. Norton (a long one, as it &s;eems by its bulk) ju&s;t before I came. But &s;he had not opened it; and &s;aid, That as &s;he was pretty calm and compo&s;ed, &s;he was afraid to look into the contents, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be ruffled; expecting, now, to hear of nothing that could do her good or give her
<PB N="147" REF="148">
plea&s;ure from that good woman's <HI>dear hard-hearted neigh|bours,</HI> as &s;he called her own relations.</P>
<P>Seeing her &s;o weak and ill, I withdrew; nor did &s;he de&s;ire me to tarry, as &s;ometimes &s;he does, when I make a motion to depart.</P>
<P>By Mrs. Smith I had &s;ome hints, as I went away, that &s;he had appropriated that evening to &s;ome offices, that were to &s;ave trouble, as &s;he called it, after her departure; and had been giving her nur&s;e, and Mrs. Lovick, and Mrs. Smith, orders about what &s;he would have done when &s;he <HI>was gone</HI>; and I believe they were of a very delicate and affecting nature; but Mrs. Smith de&s;cended not to particulars.</P>
<P>The Doctor had been with her, as well as Mr. Goddard; and they both joined with great earne&s;tne&s;s to per&s;uade her to have her <HI>hou&s;e</HI> removed out of her &s;ight: But &s;he a&s;&s;ured them, that it gave her plea&s;ure and &s;pirits; and, being a nece&s;&s;ary preparation, &s;he wondered they &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed at it, when &s;he had not any of her family about her, or any old acquaintance, on who&s;e care and exactne&s;s in the&s;e <HI>punctilio's,</HI> as &s;he called them, &s;he could rely.</P>
<P>The Doctor told Mrs. Smith, that he believed &s;he would hold out long enough for any of her friends to have notice of her &s;tate, and to &s;ee her, and hardly longer; and &s;ince he could not find, that &s;he had any certainty of hearing from or &s;eeing her cou&s;in Morden (which made it plain, that her relations continued inflexible) he would go home, and write a letter to her father, take it as &s;he would.</P>
<P>She had &s;pent great part of the day in inten&s;e devo|tions; and to-morrow morning &s;he is to have with her the &s;ame clergyman who has often attended her; from who&s;e hands &s;he will again receive the Sacrament.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ee&s;t, Lovelace, that all is preparing, that all will be ready; and I am to attend her to-morrow afternoon, to take &s;ome in&s;tructions from her in relation to my part in the office to be performed for her. And thus, omitting the particulars of a fine conver&s;ation between her and Mrs. Lovick, which the latter acquainted me with, as well as another between her and the Doctor and Apothecary. which I had a de&s;ign this evening to give you, they being
<PB N="148" REF="149">
of a very affecting nature, I have yielded to your impa|tience.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>I &s;hall di&s;patch Harry to-morrow morning early with her letter to Mi&s;s Howe: An offer &s;he took very kindly; as &s;he is extremely &s;olicitous to le&s;&s;en that young lady's apprehen&s;ions for her on not hearing from her by Saturday's po&s;t: And yet, to write the truth, how can her apprehen&s;ions be le&s;&s;ened?</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<LETTER>
<P>I Write, my beloved Mi&s;s Howe, tho' very ill &s;till: But I could not by the return of your me&s;&s;enger; for I was then unable to hold a pen.</P>
<P>Your mother's illne&s;s (as by the fir&s;t part of your letter) gave me great di&s;tre&s;s for you, till I read further: You bewail it as it becomes a daughter &s;o &s;en&s;ible. May you be ble&s;&s;ed in each other for many, very many, happy years to come! I doubt not, that even this &s;udden and grievous indi&s;po&s;ition, by the frame it has put you in, and the apprehen&s;ion it has given you of lo&s;ing &s;o dear a mo|ther, will contribute to the happine&s;s I wi&s;h you: For, alas! my dear, we never know how to value the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, till we are in danger of lo&s;ing them, or have actually lo&s;t them: And then, what would we give to have them re&s;tored to us?</P>
<P>What, I wonder, has again happened between you and Mr. Hickman? Altho' I know it not, I dare &s;ay it is owing to &s;ome pretty petulance, to &s;ome half-ungenerous advantage taken of his obligingne&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity. Will you never, my dear, give the weight You and all our Sex ought to give to the qualities of &s;obriety and regularity of life and manners in that Sex? Mu&s;t bold creatures, and forward &s;pirits, for ever, and by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of us, as well as by the indi&s;creete&s;t, be the mo&s;t kindly u&s;ed?</P>
<P>My dear friends know not, that I <HI>have</HI> actually &s;uffered within <HI>le&s;s</HI> than <HI>an inch of my life.</HI></P>
<P>Poor Mr. Brand! He meant well, I believe.&mdash;I am afraid all will turn heavily upon him, when he probably thought, that he was taking the be&s;t method to oblige:
<PB N="149" REF="150">
But were he <HI>not</HI> to have been &s;o light of belief, and &s;o weakly officious; but had given a more favourable, and, it would be &s;trange if I could not &s;ay, a <HI>ju&s;ter</HI> report; things would have been, neverthele&s;s, exactly as they are.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t lay down my pen. I am very ill. I believe I &s;hall be better by-and-by. The bad writing would be|tray me, altho' I had a mind to keep from you, what the event mu&s;t &s;oon&mdash;</P>
<P>Now I re&s;ume my trembling pen. Excu&s;e the un|&s;teady writing. It <HI>will</HI> be &s;o&mdash;</P>
<P>I have wanted no money: So don't be angry about &s;uch a trifle as money. Yet am I glad of what you in|cline me to hope, that my friends will give up the produce of my grandfather's e&s;tate &s;ince it has been in their hands: Becau&s;e, knowing it to be my right, and that <HI>they</HI> could not want it, I had already di&s;po&s;ed of a good part of it; and could only hope they would be willing to give it up at my la&s;t reque&s;t. And now how rich &s;hall I think my|&s;elf in this my la&s;t &s;tage!&mdash;And yet I did not want be|fore&mdash;Indeed I did not&mdash;For who, that has many <HI>&s;u|perfluities,</HI> can be &s;aid to want?</P>
<P>Do not, my dear friend, be concerned that I call it my <HI>la&s;t &s;tage</HI>; for what is even the long life which in high health we wi&s;h for? What, but, as we go along, a life of apprehen&s;ion, &s;ometimes for our friends, oftener for our|&s;elves? And at la&s;t, when arrived at the old age we co|vet, one heavy lo&s;s or deprivation having &s;ucceeded an|other, we &s;ee our&s;elves &s;tript, as I may &s;ay, of every-one we loved; and find our&s;elves expo&s;ed, as uncompanion|able poor creatures, to the &s;lights, to the contempts, of jo&s;tling youth, who want to pu&s;h us off the &s;tage, in hopes to po&s;&s;e&s;s what we have:&mdash;And, &s;uperadded to all, our own infirmities every day increa&s;ing: Of them&s;elves enough to make the life we wi&s;hed-for the greate&s;t di&s;ea&s;e of all! Don't you remember the lines of Howard, which once you read to me in my ivy-bower <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e are the lines the lady refers to:
<Q><L>From death we ro&s;e to life: 'Tis but the &s;ame,</L>
<L>Thro' life to pa&s;s again from whence we came.</L>
<L>With &s;hame we &s;ee our PASSIONS can prevail,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Rea&s;on, Certainty,</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> fail.</L>
<L>HONOUR, that empty name! can death de&s;pi&s;e:</L>
<L>SCORN'D LOVE, to death, as to a <HI>refuge,</HI> flies;</L>
<L>And SORROW waits for death with longing eyes.</L>
<L>HOPE triumphs o'er the thoughts of death; and FATE</L>
<L>Cheats fools, and flatters the unfortunate.</L>
<L>We fear to lo&s;e, what a <HI>&s;mall time</HI> mu&s;t wa&s;te,</L>
<L>Till life it&s;elf grows the <HI>di&s;ea&s;e</HI> at la&s;t.</L>
<L>Begging for life, we beg for <HI>more decay,</HI></L>
<L>And to be <HI>long a dying</HI> only pray.</L></Q></P></NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="151">In the di&s;po&s;ition of what belongs to me, I have en|deavoured to do every-thing in the ju&s;te&s;t and be&s;t manner I could think of; putting my&s;elf in my relations places, and, in the greater points, ordering my matters as if no mi&s;under&s;tanding had happened.</P>
<P>I hope they will not think much of &s;ome beque&s;ts where wanted, and where due from my gratitude: But if they &s;hould, what is done, is done; and I cannot now help it. Yet I mu&s;t repeat, that I hope, I hope, I have plea&s;ed every one of them. For I would not, on any account, have it thought, that, in my la&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, any-thing undaugh|terly, un&s;i&s;terly, or unlike a kin&s;woman, &s;hould have had place in a mind that is <HI>&s;o</HI> truly free (as I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay) from all re&s;entment, that it now overflows with gra|titude and ble&s;&s;ings for the good I <HI>have</HI> received, altho' it be not all that my heart wi&s;hed to receive. Were it even an <HI>hard&s;hip</HI> that I was not favoured with more, what is it but an hard&s;hip of half a year, again&s;t the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> indulgent goodne&s;s of eighteen years and an half, that ever was &s;hewn to a daughter?</P>
<P>My cou&s;in, you tell me, thinks I was off my guard, and that I was taken at &s;ome advantage. Indeed, my dear, I was not. Indeed I gave no room for advan|tage to be taken of me. I hope, one day, that will be &s;een, if I have the ju&s;tice done me which Mr. Belford a&s;|&s;ures me of.</P>
<P>I &s;hould hope, that my cou&s;in has not taken the liber|ties which you, by an ob&s;ervation (not unju&s;t) &s;eem to charge him with. For it is &s;ad to think, that the gene|rality of that Sex &s;hould make &s;o light of crimes, which they ju&s;tly hold &s;o unpardonable in their own mo&s;t inti|mate relations of ours&mdash;Yet cannot commit them without
<PB N="151" REF="152">
doing &s;uch injuries to other families and individuals, as they think them&s;elves obliged to re&s;ent unto death, when offered to their own families.</P>
<P>But we women are too often to blame on this head; &s;ince the mo&s;t virtuous among us &s;eldom make <HI>virtue</HI> the te&s;t of their approbation of the other: In&s;omuch that a man may glory in his wickedne&s;s of this &s;ort without being rejected on that account, even to the faces of wo|men of unque&s;tionable virtue. Hence it is, that a liber|tine &s;eldom thinks him&s;elf concerned &s;o much as to &s;ave appearances: And what is it not that our Sex &s;uffers in their opinions on this very &s;core? And what have I, more than many others, to an&s;wer for on this very account, in the world's eye?</P>
<P>May my &s;tory be a warning to all, how they prefer a libertine to a man of true honour; and how they permit them&s;elves to be mi&s;led (where they mean the <HI>be&s;t</HI>) by the &s;pecious, yet fooli&s;h hope of &s;ubduing riveted habits, and, as I may &s;ay, of altering natures!&mdash;The <HI>more</HI> fooli&s;h, as experience might convince us, that there is hardly one in ten, of even tolerably happy marriages, in which the wife keeps the hold in the <HI>hu&s;band</HI>'s affections, which &s;he had in the <HI>lover</HI>'s. What influence then can &s;he hope to have over the morals of an avowed libertine, who marries perhaps for conveniency, who de&s;pi&s;es the tie, and whom, it is too probable, nothing but old age, or &s;ickne&s;s, or di&s;ea&s;e (the con&s;equence of ruinous riot) can reclaim?</P>

<P>HITHER I had written, and was forced to quit my pen. And &s;o much weaker and wor&s;e I grew, that had I re|&s;umed it, to have clo&s;ed here, it mu&s;t have been with &s;uch trembling un&s;teadine&s;s, that it would have given you more concern for me, than the delay of &s;ending it away by la&s;t night's po&s;t can do: So I deferred it, to &s;ee how it would plea&s;e God to deal with me. And I find my&s;elf, after a better night than I expected, lively and clear; and hope to give you a proof that I do, in the continuation of my letter, which I will pur&s;ue as currently as if I had not left off.</P>
<P>I am glad you &s;o con&s;iderately gave my cou&s;in Morden favourable impre&s;&s;ions of Mr. Belford; &s;ince, otherwi&s;e,
<PB N="152" REF="153">
&s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding might have happened between <HI>them:</HI> For altho' I hope this gentleman is an altered man, and in time will be a reformed one, yet is he one of tho&s;e high &s;pirits that has been accu&s;tomed to re&s;ent <HI>imaginary indignities</HI> to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> when, I believe, he has not been &s;tudious to avoid giving <HI>real offences</HI> to <HI>others</HI>; men of this ca&s;t acting as if they thought all the world was made to bear with them, and they with no-body in it.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, you tell me, thought fit to intru&s;t my cou&s;in with the copy of his letter of penitence to me, and with my an&s;wer to it, rejecting him and his &s;uit: And Mr. Belford moreover acquaints me, how much concerned Mr. Lovelace is for his ba&s;ene&s;s, and how freely he accu&s;ed him&s;elf to my cou&s;in. This &s;hews, that the true bravery of &s;pirit is to be above doing a vile action; and that no|thing &s;ubjects the human mind to &s;uch meanne&s;&s;es, as to be guilty of wilful wrongs to our fellow-creatures. How low, how &s;ordid, are the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions which elaborate ba&s;ene&s;s compels! That that wretch could treat me as he did, and then could &s;o poorly creep to me to be forgiven, and to be allowed to endeavour to repair crimes &s;o wilful, &s;o black, and &s;o premeditated! How my &s;oul de&s;pi&s;ed him for his meanne&s;s on a certain occa&s;ion, of which you will one day be informed <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Meaning his meditated &s;econd violence (<HI>See Vol.</HI> v. <HI>Letter</HI> 50.) and his &s;ucceeding letters to her, &s;upplicating her pardon.</NOTE>! And him whom one's heart de&s;pi&s;es, it is far from being difficult to reject, had one ever &s;o partially favoured him once.</P>
<P>Yet am I glad this violent &s;pirit <HI>can</HI> thus creep; that, like a poi&s;onous &s;erpent, he <HI>can</HI> thus coil him&s;elf, and hide his head in his own narrow circlets; becau&s;e this &s;tooping, this aba&s;ement, gives me hope that no further mi&s;chief will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>All my apprehen&s;ion is, what may happen when I am gone; le&s;t then my cou&s;in, or any other of my family, &s;hould endeavour to avenge me, and ri&s;k their own more precious lives on that account.</P>
<P>If that part of Cain's cur&s;e were Mr. Lovelace's, <HI>To be a fugitive and vagabond in the earth</HI>; that is to &s;ay, if it meant no more harm to him, than that he &s;hould be ob|liged to travel, as it &s;eems he intends (tho' I wi&s;h him no

ill in his travels) and I could know it; then &s;hould I be ea&s;y in the hop'd-for &s;afety of my friends from his &s;kilful violence. Oh that I could hear he was a thou&s;and miles off!</P>
<P>When I began this letter, I did not think I could have run to &s;uch a length. But 'tis to YOU, my deare&s;t friend, and <HI>you</HI> have a title to the &s;pirits you rai&s;e and &s;upport; for they are no longer mine, and will &s;ub&s;ide the moment I cea&s;e writing to you.</P>
<P>But what do you bid me hope for, when you tell me, that if your mother's health will permit, you will &s;ee me in town? I <HI>hope</HI> your mother's health will be perfected as you wi&s;h; but I dare not promi&s;e my&s;elf &s;o great a fa|vour; &s;o great a <HI>ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> I will call it&mdash;And, indeed, I know not if I &s;hould be able to bear it now!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet one comfort it is in your power to give me; and that is, Let me know, and very &s;peedily it mu&s;t be if you wi&s;h to oblige me, that all matters are made up between you and Mr. Hickman; to whom, I &s;ee, you are re&s;olved, with all your bravery of &s;pirit, to owe a multitude of obligations for his patience with your flightine&s;s. Think of this, my dear proud friend! and think, like|wi&s;e, of what I have often told you, That PRIDE, in man or woman, is an extreme that hardly ever fails, &s;ooner or later, to bring forth its mortifying CONTRARY.</P>
<P>May You, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, have no di&s;comforts, but what you make to your&s;elf! Tho&s;e, as it will be in your own power to le&s;&s;en them, ought to be your own puni&s;hment if you do not. As there is no &s;uch thing as <HI>perfect happine&s;s</HI> here, &s;ince the bu&s;y mind will <HI>make</HI> to it&s;elf evils, were it to <HI>find</HI> none, you will pardon this limited wi&s;h, &s;trange as it may appear till you con&s;ider it: For to wi&s;h you no infelicities, either within or without you, were to wi&s;h you what can never happen in this world: and what, perhaps, ought not to be wi&s;hed for, if by a wi&s;h one <HI>could</HI> give one's friend &s;uch an exemption; &s;ince we are not to live here always.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not, in &s;hort, expect, that our ro&s;es will grow without thorns: But then they are u&s;eful and in&s;tructive thorns; which, by pricking the fingers of the too ha&s;ty plucker, teach future caution, at the &s;ame time that they

</HEADNOTE>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, Aug.</HI> 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Had written &s;ooner, my deare&s;t young lady, but that I have been endeavouring, ever &s;ince the receipt of your la&s;t letter, to obtain a private audience of your mo|ther, in hopes of leave to communicate it to her. But la&s;t night I was &s;urpri&s;ed by an invitation to breakfa&s;t at Harlowe-Place this morning: And the chariot came early to fetch me: An honour I did not expect.</P>
<P>When I came, I found there was to be a meeting of all your family with Colonel Morden at Harlowe-Place; and it was propo&s;ed by your mother, and con&s;ented to, that I &s;hould be pre&s;ent. Your cou&s;in, I under&s;tand, had with difficulty brought this meeting to bear; for your brother had before indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided all conver&s;ation with him on the affecting &s;ubject; urging, That it was not nece&s;&s;ary to talk to Mr. Morden upon it, who, being a remoter re|lation than them&s;elves, had no bu&s;ine&s;s to make him&s;elf a judge of their conduct to their daughter, their niece, and their &s;i&s;ter; e&s;pecially as he had declared him&s;elf in her favour; adding, That he &s;hould hardly have patience to be que&s;tioned by him on that head.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, that your mamma would have given me an opportunity of talking with her alone before the company met; but &s;he &s;eemed &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid it: I dare &s;ay, however, not with her inclination.</P>
<P>I was ordered in ju&s;t before Mr. Morden came; and was bid to &s;it down:&mdash;Which I did in the window.</P>
<P>The Colonel, when he came, began the di&s;cour&s;e, by <HI>renewing,</HI> as he called it, his &s;olicitations in your favour.
<PB N="155" REF="156">
He &s;et before them your penitence; your ill health; your virtue, tho' once betrayed, and ba&s;ely u&s;ed: He then read to them Mr. Lovelace's letter, a mo&s;t contrite one indeed <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>vi.</HI> p <HI>346.</HI></NOTE>; and your <HI>high-&s;oul'd</HI> an&s;wer <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>vi.</HI> p. <HI>356.</HI></NOTE>; for that was what he ju&s;tly called it; and he treated as it de&s;erved Mr. Brand's officious information (of which I had before heard he had made them a&s;hamed) by repre&s;entations founded upon inquiries made by Mr. Al&s;ton <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>37.</HI> of this Vol.</NOTE>, whom he procured to go up on purpo&s;e to acquaint him&s;elf with your manner of life, and what was meant by the vi&s;its of that Mr. Belford.</P>
<P>He then told them, That he had the day before waited upon Mi&s;s Howe, and had been &s;hewn a letter from you to her <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">See p. <HI>67.</HI></NOTE>, and permitted to take &s;ome memorandums from it, in which you appeared, both by hand-writing and the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents, to be &s;o very ill, that it &s;eemed doubt|ful to him, if it were po&s;&s;ible for you to get over it. And when he read to them that pa&s;&s;age, where you a&s;k Mi&s;s Howe,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What can be done for you now, were your friends to be ever &s;o favourable? and wi&s;h, for <HI>their</HI> &s;akes, more than for your <HI>own,</HI> that they would &s;till re|lent;' and then &s;ay, 'You are very ill&mdash;You mu&s;t drop your pen&mdash;And a&s;k excu&s;e for your crooked writ|ing; and take, as it were, a la&s;t farewel of Mi&s;s Howe; <HI>Adieu, my dear, adieu</HI>'</Q>, are your words;</P>
<P>O my child! my child! &s;aid your mamma, weeping, and cla&s;ping her hands.</P>
<P>Dear Madam, &s;aid your brother, be &s;o good as to think you have more children than this ingrateful one.</P>
<P>Yet your &s;i&s;ter &s;eemed affected.</P>
<P>Your uncle Harlowe wiping his eyes, O cou&s;in, &s;aid he, if one thought the poor girl was <HI>really</HI> &s;o ill&mdash;</P>
<P>She <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> &s;aid your uncle Antony. This is written to her private friend. God forbid &s;he &s;hould be quite lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Your uncle Harlowe wi&s;h'd they did not carry their re|&s;entments too far.</P>
<P>I begged for God's &s;ake, wringing my hands, and with a bended knee, that they would permit me to go up to you; engaging to give them a faithful account of the way
<PB N="156" REF="157">
you were in. But I was chidden by your brother; and this occa&s;ioned &s;ome angry words between him and Mr. Morden.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, I believe, Madam, &s;aid your &s;i&s;ter to her father and mother, we need not trouble my cou&s;in to read any more. It does but grieve and di&s;turb you. My &s;i&s;ter Clary &s;eems to be ill: I think, if Mrs. Norton were per|mitted to go up to her, it would be right. Wickedly as &s;he has acted, if &s;he be truly penitent&mdash;</P>
<P>Here &s;he &s;topt; and every one being &s;ilent, I &s;tood up once more, and be&s;ought them to let me go: And then I offered to read a pa&s;&s;age or two in your letter to me of the 24th. But I was taken up again by your brother; and this occa&s;ioned &s;till higher words between the Colonel and him.</P>
<P>Your mamma, hoping to gain upon your inflexible bro|ther, and to divert the anger of the two gentlemen from each other, propo&s;ed that the Colonel &s;hould proceed in reading the minutes he had taken from your letter.</P>
<P>He accordingly read,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Of your re&s;uming your pen: That you thought you had taken your la&s;t farewel; and the re&s;t of that very affecting pa&s;&s;age, in which you are obliged to break off more than once, and afterwards to take an airing in a chair.'</Q>
Your brother and &s;i&s;ter were affected at this; and he had recour&s;e to his &s;nuff-box. And where you comfort Mi&s;s Howe, and &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'You &s;hall be happy;'</Q>
It is more, &s;aid he, than &s;he will let any-body el&s;e be.</P>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter called you Sweet &s;oul; but with a low voice: Then grew hard-hearted again; yet &s;aid, No-body could help being affected by your pathetic grief&mdash;but that it was your talent.</P>
<P>The Colonel then went on to the good effect your air|ing had upon you; to your good wi&s;hes to Mi&s;s Howe, and Mr. Hickman; and to your concluding &s;entence, That when the happy life you wi&s;h <HI>her</HI> comes to be wound up, &s;he may be as calm and as ea&s;y at quitting it, as you hope in God you &s;hall be. Your mamma could not &s;tand this, but retired to a corner of the room, and &s;obb'd, and wept. Your father, for a few minutes, could not &s;peak, tho' he &s;eemed inclined to &s;ay &s;omething.</P>
<P>Your uncles were al&s;o both affected:&mdash;But your brother
<PB N="157" REF="158">
went round to each; and again reminded your mamma, that &s;he had other children: What was there, he &s;aid, in what was read, but the re&s;ult of the talent you had of moving the pa&s;&s;ions? And he blamed them for choo&s;ing to hear read what they knew their abu&s;ed indulgence could not be proof again&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;et Mr. Morden up again: Fie upon you, cou&s;in Harlowe, &s;aid he!&mdash;I &s;ee plainly to whom it is owing, that all relation&s;hip and ties of blood with regard to this &s;weet &s;ufferer are laid a&s;ide. Such rigors as the&s;e make it difficult for a &s;liding virtue ever to recover it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your brother pretended the honour of the family; and declared, that no child ought to be forgiven, who aban|doned the mo&s;t indulgent of parents, again&s;t warning, again&s;t the light of knowlege, as you had done.</P>
<P>But, Sir and Ladies, &s;aid I, ri&s;ing from my &s;eat in the window, and humbly turning round to each, If I may be permitted to &s;peak, my dear Mi&s;s a&s;ks only for a ble&s;&s;ing: She begs not to be received to favour: She is very ill, and a&s;ks only for a la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Come, come, goody Norton (I need not tell you who &s;aid this) you are up again with your lamentables!&mdash;A good woman, as you are, to forgive &s;o readily a crime that has been as di&s;graceful to your part in her education, as to her family, is a weakne&s;s that would induce one to &s;u&s;pect your virtue, if you were to be encounter'd by a temptation <HI>properly adapted.</HI></P>
<P>By &s;ome &s;uch charitable logic as this, &s;aid Mr. Morden, is my cou&s;in Arabella captivated, I doubt not. If to be uncharitable and unforgiving, is to give a proof of vir|tue, You, Mr. James Harlowe, are the mo&s;t virtuous young man in the world.</P>
<P>I knew how it would be, replied your brother in a pa&s;|&s;ion, if I met Mr Morden upon this bu&s;ine&s;s. I would have declined it: But you, Sir, to his father, would not permit me &s;o to do. But, Sir, turning to the Colonel, in no other pre&s;ence&mdash;</P>
<P>Then, cou&s;in James, interrupted the other gentleman, that which is <HI>your</HI> protection, it &s;eems, is <HI>mine.</HI> I am not u&s;ed to bear defiances thus&mdash;You are my cou&s;in, Sir&mdash;and the &s;on and nephew of per&s;ons as dear as near to me&mdash;There he pau&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="159">Are we, &s;aid your father, to be made &s;till more un|happy among our&s;elves, when the villain lives that ought to be the object of every-one's re&s;entment who has either a value for the family, or for this ingrateful girl?</P>
<P>That's the man, &s;aid your cou&s;in, whom la&s;t Monday, as you know, I went purpo&s;ely to make the object of mine. But what could I &s;ay, when I found him &s;o wil|ling to repair his crime?&mdash;And I give it as my opinion, and have written accordingly to my poor cou&s;in, that it is be&s;t for all round, that his offer &s;hould be accepted: And let me tell you&mdash;</P>
<P>Tell me nothing, &s;aid your father, quite enraged, of that very vile fellow! I have a riveted hatred to him. I would rather &s;ee the rebel die a hundred deaths, were it po&s;&s;ible, than that &s;he &s;hould give &s;uch a villain as him a relation to my family.</P>
<P>Well, but there is no room to think, &s;aid your mamma, that &s;he will give us &s;uch a relation, my dear. The poor girl will le&s;&s;en, I fear, the number of our relations; not increa&s;e it. If &s;he be &s;o ill as we are told &s;he is, let us &s;end Mrs. Norton up to her&mdash;That's the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> we can do&mdash;Let us take her, however, out of the hands of that Belford.</P>
<P>Both your uncles &s;upported this motion; the latter part of it e&s;pecially.</P>
<P>Your brother ob&s;erved, in his ill-natured way, what a fine piece of con&s;i&s;tency it was, in you, to refu&s;e the vile injurer, and the amends he offered; yet to throw your&s;elf upon the protection of his fa&s;t friend.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harlowe was apprehen&s;ive, &s;he &s;aid, that you would leave all you <HI>could</HI> leave to that pert creature Mi&s;s Howe (So &s;he called her) if you &s;hould die.</P>
<P>O do not, do not &s;uppo&s;e <HI>that,</HI> my Bella, &s;aid your poor mother: I cannot think of parting with my Clary&mdash;With all her faults, &s;he is my child&mdash;Her rea&s;ons for her conduct are not heard. It would break my heart to lo&s;e her.&mdash;I think, my dear, to your papa, none &s;o fit as I, if you will give me leave, to go up. And Mrs. Norton &s;hall accompany me.</P>
<P>This was a &s;weet motion; and your father pau&s;ed upon it. Mr Morden offered his &s;ervice to e&s;cort her. Your uncles &s;eemed to approve of it. But your brother da&s;h'd all.
<PB N="159" REF="160">
I hope, Sir, &s;aid he, to his father; I hope, Madam, to his mother, that you will not endeavour to recover a faulty daughter, by lo&s;ing an unculpable &s;on. I do declare, that if ever my &s;i&s;ter Clary darkens the&s;e doors again, I never will. I will &s;et out, Madam, the &s;ame hour you go to London (on &s;uch an errand) to Edinburgh; and there I will re&s;ide; and try to forget, that I have relations in England &s;o near and &s;o dear, as you are now all to me.</P>
<P>Good God, &s;aid the Colonel! What a declaration is this!&mdash;And &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, and &s;uppo&s;e, Madam (turning to your father and mother) this <HI>&s;hould</HI> be the ca&s;e, Whether is it better, think you, that you &s;hould lo&s;e for ever &s;uch a daughter as my cou&s;in Clary, or that your &s;on &s;hould go to Edinburgh, and re&s;ide there upon an e&s;tate which will be the better for his re&s;idence upon it?&mdash;</P>
<P>Your brother's pa&s;&s;ionate behaviour hereupon is hardly to be de&s;cribed. He re&s;ented it, as promoting an aliena|tion of the affection of the family to him. And to &s;uch a height were re&s;entments carried, every-one &s;iding with him, that the Colonel, with hands and eyes lifted up, cried out, What hearts of flint am I related to!&mdash;O cou&s;in Harlowe, to your father, Are you re&s;olved to have but one daughter? Are you, Madam, to be taught by a &s;on who has no bowels, to forget that you are a mother?</P>
<P>The Colonel turned from them to draw out his hand|kerchief, and could not for a minute &s;peak. The eyes of every-one, but the hard-hearted brother, caught tears from his.</P>
<P>But then turning to them (with the more indignation, as it &s;eemed, as he had been obliged to &s;hew a humanity, which, however, no brave heart &s;hould be a&s;hamed of) I leave ye all, &s;aid he, fit company for one another. I will never open my lips to any of you more upon this &s;ubject. I will in&s;tantly make my will, and in me &s;hall the dear creature have the father, uncle, brother, &s;he has lo&s;t. I will prevail upon her to take the tour of France and Italy with me; nor &s;hall &s;he return till ye know the value of <HI>&s;uch</HI> a daughter.</P>
<P>And &s;aying this, he hurried out of the room, went into the court-yard, and ordered his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Antony Harlowe went to him there, ju&s;t as he was
<PB N="160" REF="161">
mounting; and &s;aid, He hoped he &s;hould find him cooler in the evening (for he till then had lodged at his hou&s;e) and that then they would conver&s;e calmly; and every-one, mean time, would weigh all matters well&mdash;But the angry gentleman &s;aid, Cou&s;in Harlowe, I &s;hall endeavour to di&s;|charge the obligations I owe to your civility, &s;ince I have been in England: But I have been &s;o treated by that hot|headed young man (who, as far as I know, has done more to ruin his &s;i&s;ter than Lovelace him&s;elf, and <HI>this</HI> with the approbation of you all) that I will not again enter into <HI>your</HI> doors, or <HI>theirs.</HI> My &s;ervants &s;hall have orders, whither to bring what belongs to me from your hou&s;e. I will &s;ee my dear cou&s;in Clary as &s;oon as I can. And &s;o God ble&s;s you all together! Only this one word to your nephew, if you plea&s;e, That he wants to be taught the difference between courage and blu&s;ter; and it is happy for him, perhaps, that I am <HI>his</HI> kin&s;man; tho' I am &s;orry he is <HI>mine.</HI></P>
<P>I wondered to hear your uncle, on his return to them all, repeat this; becau&s;e of the con&s;equences it may be attended with, tho' I hope it will not have bad ones:&mdash;Yet it was con&s;idered as a &s;ort of challenge, and &s;o it confirmed every-body in your brother's favour; and Mi&s;s Harlowe forgot not to inveigh again&s;t that error which had brought on all the&s;e evils.</P>
<P>I took the liberty again, but with fear and trembling, to de&s;ire leave to attend you.</P>
<P>Before any other per&s;on could an&s;wer, your brother &s;aid, He &s;uppo&s;ed I looked upon my&s;elf to be my own mi&s;tre&s;s. Did I want their con&s;ents, and <HI>court&s;hip,</HI> to go up? If he might &s;peak his mind, we were <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> to be to|gether.&mdash;Yet he wi&s;h'd I would not trouble my head about their family-matters, till I was de&s;ired &s;o to do.</P>
<P>But don't you know, brother, &s;aid Mi&s;s Harlowe, that the error of any branch of a family, &s;plits that family all in pieces, and makes not only every common friend and ac|quaintance, but even <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> judges over both?&mdash;This is one of the ble&s;&s;ed effects of my &s;i&s;ter Clary's fault!</P>
<P>There never was a creature &s;o criminal, &s;aid your fa|ther, looking with di&s;plea&s;ure at me, who had not &s;ome weak heads to pity and &s;ide with her.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">I wept. Your mamma was &s;o good as to take me by the hand: Come, good woman, &s;aid &s;he, come along with me. You have too much rea&s;on to be afflicted at what afflicts Us, to want additions to your grief.</P>
<P>But, my deare&s;t young lady, I was more touched for your &s;ake than for my own: For I have been low in the world for a great number of years; and, of con&s;equence, mu&s;t have been accu&s;tomed to &s;nubs and rebuffs from the affluent. But I hope, that patience is written as legibly on my forehead, as haughtine&s;s on that of any of my obligers.</P>
<P>Your mamma led me to her chamber; and there we &s;at and wept together for &s;everal minutes, without being able to &s;peak either of us one word to the other. At la&s;t &s;he broke &s;ilence; a&s;king me, If you were really and indeed &s;o ill, as it was &s;aid you were?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered in the affirmative; and would have &s;hewn her your la&s;t letter; but &s;he declined &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>I would fain have procured from her the favour of a line to you, with her ble&s;&s;ing. I a&s;ked what was <HI>intended</HI> by your brother and &s;i&s;ter? Would nothing &s;atisfy them but your final reprobation?&mdash;I in&s;inuated, how ea&s;y it would be, did not your duty and humility govern you, to make your&s;elf independent as to circum&s;tances; but that nothing but a Ble&s;&s;ing, a <HI>la&s;t</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing, was reque&s;ted by you. And many other things I urged in your behalf. The following brief repetition of what &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, in an&s;wer to my pleas, will give you a notion of it all; and of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things.</P>
<P>She &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'She was very unhappy!

<P>BETTY was with me ju&s;t now. She tells me, that your cou&s;in Morden is &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed with them all, that he has refu&s;ed to lodge any more at your uncle Antony's; and has even taken up with inconvenient lodgings, till he is provided with others to his mind. This very much concerns them; and they repent their violent treatment of him: And the more, as he is re&s;olved, he &s;ays, to make you his heir general, and his full and whole executrix.</P>
<P>What noble fortunes &s;till, my deare&s;t young lady, await

you! I am thoroughly convinced, if it plea&s;e God to pre|&s;erve your life and your health, that every-body will &s;oon be reconciled to you, and that you will &s;ee many happy days.</P>
<P>Your mamma wi&s;hed me not to attend you as yet, be|cau&s;e &s;he hopes that I may give my&s;elf that plea&s;ure &s;oon with every-body's good liking, and even at their de&s;ire. Your cou&s;in Morden's reconciliation with them, which they are very de&s;irous of, I am ready to hope, will include theirs with you.</P>
<P>But if that &s;hould happen which I &s;o much dread, and I not with you, I &s;hould never forgive my&s;elf. Let me, therefore, my deare&s;t young lady, de&s;ire you to command my attendance, if you find any danger, and if you wi&s;h me peace of mind; and no con&s;ideration &s;hall with-hold me.</P>
<P>I hear, that Mi&s;s Howe has obtained leave from her mother to &s;ee you; and intends next week to go to town for that purpo&s;e; and (as it is believed) to buy cloaths for her approaching nuptials.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman's mother-in-law is lately dead. Her jointure of 600 <HI>l.</HI> a year is fallen in to him; and &s;he has moreover, as an acknowlegement of his good behaviour to her, left him all &s;he was worth, which was very con|&s;iderable, a few legacies excepted to her own relations.</P>
<P>The&s;e good men are uniformly good: Indeed could not el&s;e <HI>be</HI> good; and never fare the wor&s;e for being &s;o. All the world agrees, he will make that fine young lady an excellent hu&s;band. And I am &s;orry they are not as much agreed in her making him an excellent wife. But I hope a lady of her principles would not encourage his ad|dre&s;s, if, whether &s;he at pre&s;ent loves him or not, &s;he thought &s;he could <HI>not</HI> love him; or if &s;he preferred any other man to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Pocock undertakes to deliver This; but fears it will be Saturday night fir&s;t, if not Sunday morning.</P>
<P>May the Almighty protect and ble&s;s you! I long to &s;ee you&mdash;My deare&s;t young lady, I long to &s;ee you; and to fold you once more to my fond heart. I dare to &s;ay, happy days are coming. Be but chearful. Give way to hope.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">Whether for this world, or the other, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be happy.

<P>For Mi&s;s Howe's &s;ake, who, in her new engagements, will &s;o much want you; for your cou&s;in Morden's &s;ake; for your mother's &s;ake, if I mu&s;t go no further in your fa|mily; and yet I can &s;ay, for all their &s;akes; and for my &s;ake, my deare&s;t young lady; let your re&s;umed and accu&s;tomed magnanimity bear you up.

<P>THE lady would not read the letter &s;he had from Mrs. Norton, till &s;he had received the Communion, for fear it &s;hould contain any-thing that might di&s;turb that happy calm, which &s;he had been endeavouring to obtain for it. And when that &s;olemn office was over, &s;he was &s;o compo&s;ed, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he thought &s;he could receive any news, however affecting, with tranquillity.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, in reading it, &s;he was forced to leave off &s;everal times thro' weakne&s;s and a dimne&s;s in her &s;ight, of which &s;he complained; if I may &s;ay <HI>complained</HI>; for &s;o ea&s;y and &s;oft were her complaints, that they could hardly be called &s;uch.</P>
<P>She was very much affected at divers parts of this letter.
<PB N="166" REF="167">
She wept &s;everal times, and &s;igh'd often. Mrs. Lovick told me, that the&s;e were the gentle exclamations &s;he broke out into, as &s;he read:&mdash;<HI>Her unkind, her cruel brother!&mdash;How</HI> un&s;i&s;terly!&mdash;<HI>Poor dear woman!</HI> &s;eeming to &s;peak of Mrs. Norton. <HI>Her kind cou&s;in!&mdash;O the&s;e flaming &s;pirits!</HI>&mdash;And then reflecting upon her&s;elf more than once,&mdash;<HI>What a deep error is mine!&mdash;What evils have I been the occa&s;ion of!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>When I was admitted to her pre&s;ence, I have received, &s;aid &s;he, a long and not very plea&s;ing letter from my dear Mrs. Norton: It will &s;oon be in your hands. I am ad|vi&s;ed again&s;t appointing you to the office you have &s;o kindly accepted: But you mu&s;t re&s;ent nothing of the&s;e things. My choice will have an odd appearance to them: But it is now too late to alter it, if I would.</P>
<P>I would fain write an an&s;wer to it, continued &s;he: But I have no di&s;tinct &s;ight, Mr. Belford, no &s;teadine&s;s of fingers.&mdash;This mi&s;tine&s;s, however, will perhaps be gone by-and-by&mdash;Then turning to Mrs. Lovick, I don't think I am dying yet&mdash;not <HI>actually</HI> dying, Mrs. Lovick&mdash;For I have no bodily pain&mdash;No numbne&s;&s;es; no &s;igns of imme|diate death, I think&mdash;And my breath, which u&s;ed of late to be &s;o &s;hort, is now tolerable&mdash;My head clear, my in|tellects free&mdash;I think I cannot be dying yet&mdash;I &s;hall have agonies, I doubt&mdash;Life will not give up &s;o ble&s;&s;edly ea&s;y, I fear&mdash;Yet how merciful is the Almighty, to give his poor creature &s;uch a &s;weet &s;erenity!&mdash;'Tis what I have prayed for!&mdash;What encouragement, Mrs. Lovick, &s;o near one's di&s;&s;olution, to have it to hope, that one's prayers are an&s;wered!</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith, as well as Mrs. Lovick, was with her. They were both in tears; nor had I, any more than they, power to &s;ay a word in an&s;wer: Yet &s;he &s;poke all this, as well as what follows, with a &s;urpri&s;ing compo&s;ure of mind and countenance.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he, a&s;&s;uming a &s;till &s;prightlier air and accent, let me talk a little to you, while I am thus able to &s;ay what I have to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lovick, don't leave us; for the women were ri&s;ing to go&mdash;Pray &s;it down; and do you, Mrs. Smith, &s;it
<PB N="167" REF="168">
down too.&mdash;Dame Shelbourne, take this key, and open that upper drawer. I will move to it.</P>
<P>She did, with trembling knees. Here, Mr. Belford, is my will. It is witne&s;&s;ed by three per&s;ons of Mr. Smith's acquaintance.</P>
<P>I dare to hope, that my cou&s;in Morden will give you a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if you reque&s;t it of him. My cou&s;in Morden continues his affection for me: But as I have not &s;een <HI>him,</HI> I leave all the trouble upon <HI>you,</HI> Mr. Belford. This deed may want forms; and it does, no doubt: But the le&s;s, as I have my grandfather's will almo&s;t by heart, and have often enough heard that canva&s;&s;ed. I will lay it by it&s;elf in this corner; putting it at the further end of the drawer.</P>
<P>She then took up a parcel of letters, inclo&s;ed in one cover, &s;ealed with three &s;eals of black wax: This, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ealed up la&s;t night. The cover, Sir, will let you know what is to be done with what it inclo&s;es. This is the &s;uper&s;cription (holding it clo&s;e to her eyes, and rubbing them); <HI>As &s;oon as I am certainly dead, this to be broke open by Mr. Belford.</HI>&mdash;Here, Sir, I put it (placing it by the will).&mdash;The&s;e folded papers are letters and copies of letters, di&s;po&s;ed according to their dates. Mi&s;s Howe will do with tho&s;e as you and &s;he &s;hall think fit. If I receive any more, or more come when I cannot receive them, they may be put into this drawer (pulling out and pu&s;hing in the looking-gla&s;s drawer) [You'll be &s;o kind as to ob|&s;erve that, Mrs. Lovick, and dame Shelburne] to be given to Mr. Belford, be they from whom they will.</P>
<P>Here, Sir, proceeded &s;he, I put the keys of my appa|rel (putting them into the drawers with her papers). All is in order, and the inventory upon them, and an account of what I have di&s;po&s;ed of: So that no-body need to a&s;k Mrs. Smith any que&s;tions.</P>
<P>There will be no immediate need to open or in&s;pect the trunks which contain my wearing apparel. Mrs. Norton will open them, or order &s;omebody to do it for her, in your pre&s;ence. Mrs. Lovick; for &s;o I have di|rected in my will. They may be &s;ealed up now: I &s;hall never more have occa&s;ion to open them.</P>
<P>She then, tho' I expo&s;tulated to the contrary, cau&s;ed me to &s;eal them up with my &s;eal.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">After this, &s;he locked the drawer where were her pa|pers; fir&s;t taking out her book of <HI>Meditations,</HI> as &s;he called it; &s;aying, She &s;hould, perhaps, have u&s;e for that; and then de&s;ired me to take the key of that drawer; for &s;he &s;hould have no further occa&s;ion for that neither.</P>
<P>All this in &s;o compo&s;ed and chearful a manner, that we were equally &s;urpri&s;ed and affected with it.</P>
<P>You can witne&s;s for me, Mrs. Smith, and &s;o can you, Mrs. Lovick, proceeded &s;he, if any one a&s;k after my life and conver&s;ation, &s;ince you have known me, that I have been very orderly; have kept good hours, and never have lain out of your hou&s;e, but when I was in pri&s;on; and then, you know, I could not help it.</P>
<P>O Lovelace! that thou had&s;t heard her, or &s;een her, unknown to her&s;elf, on this occa&s;ion!&mdash;Not one of us could &s;peak a word.</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave the world in perfect charity, proceeded &s;he. And turning towards the women, Don't be &s;o much con|cerned for me, my good friends. This is all but needful preparation; and I &s;hall be very happy.</P>
<P>Then again rubbing her eyes, which &s;he &s;aid were mi&s;ty, and looking more intently round upon each, par|ticularly on me&mdash;God ble&s;s you all, &s;aid &s;he! how kindly are you concerned for me!&mdash;Who &s;ays, I am friendle&s;s? Who &s;ays, I am abandoned, and among &s;trangers?&mdash;Good Mr. Belford, don't be &s;o <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> humane!&mdash;Indeed (putting her handkerchief to her charming eyes) you will make me le&s;s happy, than I am &s;ure you wi&s;h me to be.</P>
<P>While we were thus &s;olemnly engaged, a &s;ervant came with a letter from her cou&s;in Morden:&mdash;Then, &s;aid &s;he, he is not come <HI>him&s;elf!</HI></P>
<P>She broke it open; but every line, &s;he &s;aid, appeared two to her: So that, being unable to read it her&s;elf, &s;he de&s;ired I would read it to her. I did &s;o; and wi&s;h'd it were more con&s;olatory to her: But &s;he was all patient at|tention; tears, however, often trickling down her cheeks. By the date, it was written ye&s;terday; and this is the &s;ub|&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>He tells her,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the Thur&s;day before he had pro|cured a general meeting of her principal relations, at her father's; tho' not without difficulty, her haughty
<PB N="169" REF="170">
brother oppo&s;ing it, and, when met, rendering all his endeavours to reconcile them to her ineffectual. He cen|&s;ures him, as the mo&s;t ungovernable young man he ever knew: Some great &s;ickne&s;s, he &s;ays, &s;ome heavy mi&s;|fortune, is wanted to bring him to a knowlege of him|&s;elf, and of what is due from him to others; and he wi&s;hes, that he were not <HI>her</HI> brother, and <HI>his</HI> cou&s;in. Nor does he &s;pare her father and uncles, for being &s;o implicitly led by him.'</Q></P>
<P>He tells her,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That he parted with them all in high di&s;|plea&s;ure, and thought never more to darken any of their doors: That he declared as much to her two uncles, who came to him on Saturday, to try to accommodate with him; and who found him preparing to go to London to attend her; and that, notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;&s;ing in|treaties, he determined &s;o to do, and not to go with them to Harlowe-Place, or to either of their own hou&s;es; and accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with &s;uch an an&s;wer.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But that her noble letter, as he calls it, of Aug. 31. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>xxix.</HI> p. <HI>122.</HI></NOTE> being brought him about an hour after their departure, he thought it might affect them as much as it did him; and give them the exalted opinion of her virtue and ho|nour, which was &s;o well de&s;erved; and at the &s;ame time convince them of what they made &s;uch difficulty to be|lieve; to wit, that you, and all your relations, were &s;ol|licitous to obtain the honour of her alliance, on her own terms: And that this induced him to turn his hor&s;e's head back to her uncle Antony's, in&s;tead of forward towards London.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That accordingly arriving there, and finding her two uncles together, he read to them the affecting letter; which left neither of the three a dry eye: That the ab|&s;ent, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, bearing all the load, they accu&s;ed her brother and &s;i&s;ter; and be&s;ought him to put off his journey to town, till he could carry with him the ble&s;&s;ings which &s;he had formerly in vain &s;olicited for; and (as they hoped) the happy tidings of a general re|conciliation.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That not doubting but his vi&s;it would be the more welcome to her, if the&s;e good ends could be obtained,
<PB N="170" REF="171">
he the more readily complied with their de&s;ires. But not being willing to &s;ubject him&s;elf to the po&s;&s;ibility of receiving fre&s;h in&s;ults from her brother, he had given her uncles a copy of her letter, for the family to a&s;&s;em|ble upon; and de&s;ired to know, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, the re&s;ult of their deliberations</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He tells her, that he &s;hall bring her up the accounts relating to the produce of her grandfather's e&s;tate, and adju&s;t them with her; having actually in his hands the arrears due to her from it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He highly applauds the noble manner in which &s;he re|&s;ents your u&s;age of her. It is impo&s;&s;ible, he owns, that you can either de&s;erve her, or to be forgiven. But as you do ju&s;tice to her virtue, and offer to make her all the reparation now in your power; and as &s;he is &s;o very earne&s;t with him not to re&s;ent that u&s;age; and declares, that you could not have been the author of her calami|ties but through a &s;trange concurrence of unhappy cau&s;es; and as he is not at a lo&s;s to know how to place to a <HI>pro|per account</HI> that &s;trange concurrence; he de&s;ires her not to be apprehen&s;ive of any vindictive mea&s;ures from him.</Q></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s (as may be expected)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'he inveighs again&s;t you; as he finds, that &s;he gave you no advantage over her. But he forbears to enter further into this &s;ubject, he &s;ays, till he has the honour to &s;ee her; and the ra|ther, as &s;he &s;eems &s;o much determined again&s;t you. How|ever, he cannot but &s;ay, that he thinks you a gallant man, and a man of &s;en&s;e; and that you have the repu|tation of being thought a generous man in every in&s;tance but where the Sex is concerned. In <HI>&s;uch,</HI> he owns, that you have taken inexcu&s;able liberties. And he is &s;orry to &s;ay, that there are very few young men of fortune but who allow them&s;elves in the &s;ame. Both Sexes, he ob|&s;erves, too much love to have each other in their power: Yet he hardly ever knew man or woman who was very fond of power, make a right u&s;e of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'If &s;he be &s;o ab&s;olutely determined again&s;t marrying you, as &s;he declares &s;he is, he hopes, he &s;ays, to prevail upon her to take (as &s;oon as her health will permit) a little tour abroad with him, as what will probably e&s;ta|bli&s;h it; &s;ince traveling is certainly the be&s;t phy&s;ic for

all tho&s;e di&s;orders which owe their ri&s;e to grief and di&s;|appointment. An ab&s;ence of two or three years will endear her to every one, on her return, and every-one to her.</Q></P>

<P>When I had read the letter thro' to the langui&s;hing lady, And &s;o, my friends, &s;aid &s;he, have I heard of a patient who actually died, while five or &s;ix principal phy&s;icians were in a con&s;ultation, and not agreed upon what name to give to his di&s;temper.

<P>I a&s;ked, If I &s;hould write to her cou&s;in, as he knew not how ill &s;he was, to ha&s;ten up.</P>
<P>By no means, &s;he &s;aid; &s;ince, if he were not already &s;et out, &s;he was per&s;uaded that &s;he &s;hould be &s;o low by the time he could receive my letter, and come, that his pre|&s;ence would but di&s;compo&s;e and hurry <HI>her,</HI> and afflict <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, however, &s;he is not &s;o very near her end. And without &s;aying any more to her, when I retired, I wrote to Colonel Morden, that if he expects to &s;ee his beloved cou&s;in alive, he mu&s;t lo&s;e no time in &s;etting out. I &s;ent this letter by his own &s;ervant.</P>

<P>Mrs. Walton the milaner has al&s;o ju&s;t now acquainted Mrs. Smith, that her hu&s;band had a letter brought by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger from par&s;on Brand, within this half-hour, inclo&s;ing the copy of one he had written to Mr. John Harlowe, recanting his officious one.</P>
<P>And as all the&s;e, and the copy of the lady's letter to Col. Morden, will be with them pretty much at a time, the de|vil's in the family if they are not &s;truck with a remor&s;e that &s;hall bur&s;t open the double-barred doors of their hearts.</P>
<P>Will. engages to reach you with this (late as it will be) before you go to re&s;t. He begs that I will te&s;tify for him the hour and the minute I &s;hall give it him. It is ju&s;t half an hour after ten.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I may judge of the hearts of other parents by my own, I cannot doubt but you will take it well to be informed, that you have yet an opportunity to &s;ave your&s;elf and family great future regret, by di&s;patching hi|ther &s;ome one of it, with your la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, and your la|dy's, to the mo&s;t excellent of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, Sir, that &s;he has been repre&s;ented to you in a very different light from the true one. And this it is that induces me to acquaint you, that I think her, on the be&s;t grounds, ab&s;olutely irreproach|able in all her conduct which has pa&s;&s;ed under my eye, or come to my ear; and that her very misfortunes are made glorious to her, and honourable to all that are re|lated to her, by the u&s;e &s;he has made of them; and by the patience and re&s;ignation with which &s;he &s;upports her&s;elf in a painful, lingering, and di&s;piriting decay; and by the greatne&s;s of mind with which &s;he views her approaching di&s;&s;olution. And all this from proper motives; from mo|tives in which a dying &s;aint might glory.</P>
<P>She knows not that I write. I mu&s;t indeed acknow|lege, that I offered to do &s;o, &s;ome days ago, and that very pre&s;&s;ingly: Nor did &s;he refu&s;e me from ob&s;tinacy&mdash;She &s;eems not to know what that is&mdash;But de&s;ired me to forbear for two days only, in hopes that her newly-arrived cou&s;in, who, as &s;he heard, was &s;oliciting for her, would be able to &s;ucceed in her favour.</P>
<P>I hope I &s;hall not be thought an officious man on this occa&s;ion: But if I am, I cannot help it; being driven to write, by a kind of <HI>parental</HI> and irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e.</P>
<P>But, Sir, whatever you do, or permit to be done, mu&s;t
<PB N="173" REF="174">
be &s;peedily done; for &s;he cannot, I verily think, live a week: And how long of that &s;hort &s;pace &s;he may enjoy her admirable intellects, to take comfort in the favours you may think proper to confer upon her, cannot be &s;aid. I am, SIR,</P>

<P>THE urgency of the ca&s;e, and the opportunity by your &s;ervant, will &s;ufficiently apologize for this trouble from a &s;tranger to your per&s;on; who, however, is not a &s;tranger to your merit.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you are imploying your good offices with Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe's parents, and other relations, to reconcile them to the mo&s;t meritorious daughter and kin&s;|woman, that ever family had to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Generou&s;ly as this is intended by you, we <HI>here</HI> have too much rea&s;on to think all your &s;olicitudes on this head will be unnece&s;&s;ary: For, it is the opinion of every one who has the honour of being admitted to her pre&s;ence, that &s;he cannot live over three days: So that if you wi&s;h to &s;ee her alive you mu&s;t lo&s;e no time to come up.</P>
<P>She knows not that I write. I had done it &s;ooner, if I had had the lea&s;t doubt that before now &s;he would not have received from you &s;ome news of the happy ef|fects of your kind mediation in her behalf. I am, SIR,</P>

<P>AND can it be, that this admirable creature will &s;o &s;oon leave this cur&s;ed world? For cur&s;ed I &s;hall think it, and more cur&s;ed my&s;elf, when &s;he is gone. O Jack! thou,
<PB N="174" REF="175">
who can&s;t &s;it &s;o cool, and, like Addi&s;on's Angel, <HI>direct,</HI> and even <HI>enjoy,</HI> the &s;torm, that tears up my happine&s;s by the roots, blame me not for my impatience, however un|rea&s;onable! If thou knewe&s;t, that already I feel the tor|ments of the damned, in the remor&s;e that wrings my heart, on looking back upon my pa&s;t actions by her, thou would&s;t not be the devil thou art, to halloo on a worrying con&s;ci|ence, which, without thy mercile&s;s aggravations, is alto|gether intolerable.</P>
<P>I know not what I write, nor what I would write. When the company that u&s;ed to delight me is as unea&s;y to me as my reflections are painful, and I can neither help nor di|vert my&s;elf, mu&s;t not every &s;ervant about me partake in a perturbation &s;o &s;incere?</P>
<P>Shall I give thee a faint picture of the horrible unea&s;i|ne&s;s with which my mind &s;truggles? And faint indeed it mu&s;t be; for nothing but outrageous madne&s;s can exceed it; and <HI>that</HI> only in the apprehen&s;ion of others; &s;ince, as to the &s;ufferer, it is certain, that actual di&s;traction (take it out of its lucid intervals) mu&s;t be an infinitely more happy &s;tate than the &s;u&s;pen&s;e and anxieties that bring it on.</P>
<P>Forbidden to attend the dear creature, yet longing to &s;ee her, I would give the world to be admitted once more to her beloved pre&s;ence. I ride towards London three or four times a day, re&s;olving <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con.</HI> twenty times in two or three miles; and at la&s;t ride back; and in view of Uxbridge, loathing even the kind friend and ho&s;pi|table hou&s;e, turn my hor&s;e's head again towards the town, and re&s;olve to gratify my humour, let her take it as &s;he will; but, at the very entrance of it, after infinite can|va&s;ings, once more alter my mind, dreading to offend and &s;hock her, le&s;t by that means I &s;hould curtail a life &s;o pre|cious.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, in particular, to give you an idea of the &s;trength of that impatience which I cannot avoid &s;uffer|ing to break out upon my &s;ervants, I had no &s;ooner di&s;|patched Will, than I took hor&s;e to meet him on his return.</P>
<P>In order to give him time, I loiter'd about on the road, riding up <HI>this</HI> lane to the one highway, down <HI>that</HI> to the other, ju&s;t as my hor&s;e pointed; all the way cur&s;ing my very being; and tho' &s;o lately looking <HI>down</HI> upon all the
<PB N="175" REF="176">
world, wi&s;hing to change conditions with the poore&s;t beg|gar that cried to me for charity as I rode by him&mdash;and throwing him money, in hopes to obtain by his prayers the ble&s;&s;ing my heart pants after.</P>
<P>After I had &s;auntered-about an hour or two (which &s;eemed three or four tedious ones) fearing I had &s;lipt the fellow, I inquired at every turnpike, whether a &s;ervant in &s;uch a livery had not pa&s;&s;ed thro' in his return from London, on a full gallop (for woe had been to the dog, had I met him on a &s;luggi&s;h trot!). And le&s;t I &s;hould mi&s;s him at one end of Ken&s;ington, as he might take either the Acton or Hamer&s;mith road; or at the other, as he might come thro' the Park, or not; how many &s;core times did I ride backwards and forwards from the palace to the Gore, making my&s;elf the &s;ubject of ob&s;ervation to all pa&s;|&s;engers, whether on hor&s;eback or on foot; who, no doubt, wondered to &s;ee a well-dre&s;&s;ed and well-mounted man, &s;ometimes ambling, &s;ometimes prancing (as the bea&s;t had more fire than his ma&s;ter) backwards and forwards in &s;o &s;hort a compa&s;s!</P>
<P>Yet all this time, tho' longing to e&s;py the fellow, did I dread to meet him, le&s;t he &s;hould be charged with fatal tidings.</P>
<P>When at di&s;tance I &s;aw any man galloping towards me, my re&s;emblance-forming fancy immediately made it to be him; and then my heart bounded to my mouth, as if it would have choaked me. But when the per&s;on's nearer approach undeceived me, how did I cur&s;e the var|let's delay, and thee by turns; and how ready was I to draw my pi&s;tol at the &s;tranger, for having the impudence to gal|lop; which none but my me&s;&s;enger, I thought, had ei|ther right or rea&s;on to do! For all the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, I am ready to imagine, &s;hould &s;tand &s;till on an oc|ca&s;ion &s;o melancholy, and &s;o intere&s;ting to my&s;elf. Nay, for this week pa&s;t, I could cut the throat of any man or woman I &s;ee laugh, while I am in &s;uch dejection of mind.</P>
<P>I am now convinced, that the wretches who fly from a heavy &s;cene, labour under ten times more di&s;tre&s;s in the intermediate &s;u&s;pen&s;e and apprehen&s;ion, than <HI>they</HI> can do who are pre&s;ent at it, and &s;ee and know the wor&s;t; &s;o much greater are the evils we dread than tho&s;e we &s;ee!&mdash;
<PB N="176" REF="177">
And &s;o able is fancy or imagination, the more immediate offspring of the &s;oul, to outdo fact, let the &s;ubject be ei|ther joyous or grievous.</P>
<P>And hence, as I conceive, it is, that all plea&s;ures are greater in the <HI>expectation,</HI> or in the <HI>reflection,</HI> than in <HI>frui|tion</HI>; as all pains, which pre&s;s heavy upon both parts of that unequal union by which frail mortality holds its pre|carious tenure, generally are mo&s;t acute in the <HI>pre&s;ent ten&s;e:</HI> For how ea&s;y &s;it upon the <HI>reflection</HI> the heavie&s;t mi&s;|fortunes, e&s;pecially when &s;urmounted!&mdash;But <HI>mo&s;t</HI> ea&s;y, I confe&s;s, tho&s;e in which Body has more concern than Soul. This, however, is a point of philo&s;ophy I have neither time nor head ju&s;t now to weigh: So take it as it falls from a madman's pen.</P>
<P>Woe be to either of the wretches who &s;hall bring me the fatal news that &s;he is no more! For it is but too likely that a &s;hriek-owl &s;o hated will never whoot or &s;cream again; unle&s;s the &s;hock, that will probably di&s;order my whole frame on &s;o &s;ad an occa&s;ion (by <HI>un&s;teadying</HI> my hand) &s;hall divert my aim from his head, heart, or bow|els, if it turn not again&s;t my own.</P>
<P>But, &s;urely, &s;he will not, &s;he cannot yet die! Such a matchle&s;s excellence,
<Q><L>&mdash;who&s;e mind</L>
<L>Contains a world, and &s;eems for all things fram'd,</L></Q>
could not be lent to be &s;o &s;oon demanded back again!</P>
<P>But may it not be, that thou, Belford, art in a plot with the dear creature (who will not let me attend her to convince my&s;elf) in order to work up my &s;oul to the deepe&s;t remor&s;e and penitence; and that, when &s;he is con|vinced of the &s;incerity of both, and when my mind is made &s;uch wax, as to be fit to take what impre&s;&s;ion &s;he plea&s;es to give it, &s;he will then rai&s;e me up with the joy|ful tidings of her returning health and acceptance of me?</P>
<P>What would I give to have it &s;o! And when the hap|pine&s;s of <HI>hundreds,</HI> as well as the peace and reconciliation of &s;everal eminent families, depend upon <HI>her</HI> re&s;toration and happine&s;s, why &s;hould it not be &s;o?</P>
<P>But let me pre&s;ume it will. Let me indulge my former hope, however improbable.&mdash;<HI>I will</HI>; and <HI>enjoy</HI> it too. And
<PB N="177" REF="178">
let me tell thee how ec&s;tatic my delight would be on the unravelling of &s;uch a plot as this!</P>
<P>Do, <HI>dear</HI> Belford, let it be &s;o!&mdash;And, O my deare&s;t, and ever-dear Clari&s;&s;a, keep me no longer in this cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e; in which I &s;uffer a thou&s;and times more than ever I made thee &s;uffer.

<P>WHEN I read yours of this morning, I could not help pitying you for the account you give of the dreadful anxiety and &s;u&s;pen&s;e you labour under. I wi&s;h from my heart all were to end as you are &s;o willing to hope: But it will not be; and your &s;u&s;pen&s;e, if the wor&s;t part of your torment, as you &s;ay it is, will &s;oon be over; but, alas! in a way you wi&s;h not.</P>
<P>I attended the lady ju&s;t now. She is extremely ill: Yet is &s;he aiming at an an&s;wer to her Mrs. Norton's letter, which &s;he began ye&s;terday in her own chamber, and has written a good deal; but in a hand not like her own fine one, as Mrs. Lovick tells me, but much larger, and the lines crooked.</P>
<P>I have accepted of the offer of a room adjoining to the widow Lovick's, till I &s;ee how matters go; but unknown to the lady; and I &s;hall go home every night, for a few hours:&mdash;I would not lo&s;e a &s;entence that I could gain
<PB N="178" REF="179">
from lips &s;o in&s;tructive, nor the opportunity of receiving any command from her, for an e&s;tate.</P>
<P>In this my new apartment, I now write, and &s;hall con|tinue to write, as occa&s;ions offer, that I may be the more circum&s;tantial: But I depend upon the return of my let|ters, or copies of them, on demand, that I may have to|gether all that relates to this affecting &s;tory; which I &s;hall reperu&s;e with melancholy plea&s;ure to the end of my life.</P>
<P>I think I will &s;end thee Brand's letter to Mr. John Har|lowe, recanting his ba&s;e &s;urmizes. It is a matchle&s;s piece of pedantry; and may perhaps a little divert thy deep chagrin: Some time hence at lea&s;t it may, if not now.</P>
<P>What wretched creatures are there in the world! What &s;trangely mixed characters!&mdash;So &s;en&s;ible and &s;o fooli&s;h at the &s;ame time! What a <HI>various,</HI> what a <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> creature is man!&mdash;</P>

<P>THE lady has ju&s;t fini&s;hed her letter, and has entertained Mrs. Lovick, Mrs. Smith, and me, with a noble di&s;cour&s;e on the vanity and brevity of life, which I cannot do ju&s;tice to in the repetition: And indeed I am &s;o grieved for her, that, ill as &s;he is, my intellects are not half &s;o clear as hers.</P>
<P>A few things which made the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion up|on me, as well from the &s;entiments them&s;elves, as from her manner of uttering them, I remember. She intro|duced them thus:</P>
<P>I am thinking, &s;aid &s;he, what a gradual and happy death God Almighty (Ble&s;&s;ed be his name!) affords me! Who would have thought, that, &s;uffering what I have &s;uf|fered, and abandoned as I have been, with &s;uch a tender education as I have had, I &s;hould be &s;o long a dying!&mdash;But &s;ee how by little and little it has come to this. I was fir&s;t taken off from the power of <HI>walking:</HI> Then I took a <HI>coach</HI>&mdash;A coach grew too violent an exerci&s;e: Then I took a <HI>chair.</HI>&mdash;The pri&s;on was a large DEATH-STRIDE upon me&mdash;I &s;hould have <HI>&s;uffered longer el&s;e!</HI>&mdash;Next, I was un|able to go to <HI>Church</HI>; then to go <HI>up</HI> or <HI>down &s;tairs</HI>; Now hardly can move from one <HI>room</HI> to <HI>another</HI>; and a <HI>le&s;s room</HI> will &s;oon hold me.&mdash;My <HI>eyes</HI> begin to fail me, &s;o that at times I cannot &s;ee to read di&s;tinctly; and now I can hardly <HI>write,</HI> or hold a pen.&mdash;Next, I pre&s;ume, I
<PB N="179" REF="180">
&s;hall know no-body, nor be able to thank any of you: I therefore now once more thank you, Mrs. Lovick, and you, Mrs. Smith, and you, Mr. Belford, while I <HI>can</HI> thank you, for all your kindne&s;s to me. And thus by little and little, in &s;uch a gradual &s;en&s;ible death as I am ble&s;&s;ed with, God dies away in us, as I may &s;ay, all human &s;atisfac|tions, in order to &s;ubdue his poor creatures to Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thou may&s;t gue&s;s how affected we all were at this moving account of her progre&s;&s;ive weakne&s;s. We heard it with wet eyes; for what with the womens example, and what with her moving eloquence, I could no more help it than they. But we were &s;ilent neverthele&s;s; and &s;he went on, applying her&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>O Mr. Belford! This is a poor tran&s;itory life in its be&s;t enjoyments. We flutter about here and there, with all our vanities about us, like painted butterflies, for a gay, but a very &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, till at la&s;t we lay our&s;elves down in a quie&s;cent &s;tate, and turn into vile worms: And who knows in what form, or to what condition, we &s;hall ri&s;e again?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you would permit me, a young creature, ju&s;t turned of Nineteen years of age, blooming and healthy as I was a few months ago, now nipt by the cold hand of death, to influence you, in <HI>the&s;e my la&s;t hours,</HI> to a life of regularity and repentance for any pa&s;t evils you may have been guilty of. For, believe me, Sir, that now, in this la&s;t &s;tage, very few things will bear the te&s;t, or be pa&s;&s;ed as laudable, if <HI>pardonable,</HI> at our own Ear, much le&s;s at a more tremendous one, in all we have done, or delighted in, even in a life not very offen&s;ive neither, as <HI>we</HI> may think!&mdash;Ought we not then to &s;tudy in our <HI>full day,</HI> be|fore the dark hours approach, &s;o to live, as may afford reflections that will &s;often the agony of the la&s;t moments when they come, and let in upon the departing &s;oul a ray of Divine Mercy to illuminate its pa&s;&s;age into an awful eternity?</P>
<P>She was ready to faint, and, choo&s;ing to lie down, I withdrew, I need not &s;ay, with a melancholy heart: And when I was got to my new-taken apartment, my heart was &s;till more affected by the &s;ight of the &s;olemn letter the admirable lady had &s;o lately fini&s;hed. It was communi|cated
<PB N="180" REF="181">
to me by Mrs. Lovick; who had it to copy for me; but it was not to be <HI>delivered to me</HI> till after her departure. However, I tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed &s;o far, as to prevail upon the widow to let me take a copy of it; which I did directly in cha|racter.</P>
<P>I &s;end it inclo&s;ed. If thou can&s;t read it, and thy heart not bleed at thy eyes, thy remor&s;e can hardly be &s;o deep as thou ha&s;t inclined me to think it is.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mrs.</HI> NORTON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am afraid I &s;hall not be able to write all that is upon my mind to &s;ay to you upon the &s;ubject of your la&s;t. Yet I will try.</P>
<P>As to my friends, and as to the &s;ad breakfa&s;ting, I can|not help being afflicted for <HI>them.</HI> What, alas! has not my mother, in particular, &s;uffered by my ra&s;hne&s;s!&mdash;Yet to allow &s;o much for a &s;on!&mdash;&s;o little for a daughter!&mdash;But all now will &s;oon be over, as to me. I hope they will bury all their re&s;entments in my grave.</P>
<P>As to your advice in relation to Mr. Belford, let me only &s;ay, that the unhappy reprobation I have met with, and my &s;hort time, mu&s;t be my apology now.&mdash;I wi&s;h I <HI>could</HI> have written to my mother and my uncles, as you advi&s;e. And yet, favours come <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;lowly from them!&mdash;</P>
<P>The granting of one reque&s;t only now remains as a de|&s;irable from them. Which neverthele&s;s, when granted, I &s;hall not be &s;en&s;ible of. It is, that they will be plea&s;ed to permit my remains to be laid with tho&s;e of my an|ce&s;tors&mdash;Placed at the feet of my dear grandfather, as I have mentioned in my will. This, however, as they plea&s;e. For, after all, this vile body ought not &s;o much to engage my cares. It is a weakne&s;s&mdash;But let it be called a <HI>natural</HI> weakne&s;s, and I &s;hall be excu&s;ed; e&s;pecially when a re|verential gratitude &s;hall be known to be the foundation of it. You know, my dear woman, how my grandfather
<PB N="181" REF="182">
loved me. And you know how much I honoured him, and that from my very infancy to the hour of his death. How often &s;ince, have I wi&s;hed, that he had not loved me &s;o well!</P>
<P>I wi&s;h not now, at the writing of this, to &s;ee even my cou&s;in Morden. O my ble&s;&s;ed woman! My dear mater|nal friend! I am entering upon a better tour, than to France or Italy either!&mdash;Or even than to &s;ettle at my once beloved dairy-hou&s;e!&mdash;All the&s;e pro&s;pects and plea|&s;ures, which u&s;ed to be &s;o agreeable to me in health, how poor &s;eem they to me now!&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, my dear mamma Norton, I &s;hall be happy! I <HI>know</HI> I &s;hall!&mdash;I have charming forebodings of happine&s;s already!&mdash;Tell all my dear friends, for their comfort, that I &s;hall!&mdash;Who would not bear the puni&s;h|ments I have borne, to have the pro&s;pects and a&s;&s;urances I rejoice in!&mdash;A&s;&s;urances I might <HI>not have had,</HI> were all my own wi&s;hes to have been granted me!</P>
<P>Neither do I want to &s;ee even <HI>you,</HI> my dear Mrs. Nor|ton. Neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice to my own grati|tude, declare, that there <HI>was</HI> a time, that your pre&s;ence and comfortings would have been balm to my wounded mind, could you have been permitted to come, without incurring di&s;plea&s;ure from tho&s;e who&s;e e&s;teem it is nece&s;|&s;ary for you to cultivate and pre&s;erve. But were you now, even by con&s;ent, and with reconciliatory tidings, to come, it would but add to your grief: And the &s;ight of one I &s;o dearly love, &s;o happily fraught with good news, might but draw me back to wi&s;hes I have had great &s;truggles to get above. And let me tell you for your comfort, that I have not left undone, any-thing that ought to be done, either re&s;pecting <HI>mind</HI> or <HI>per&s;on</HI>; no, not to the minute&s;t prepara|tion: So that nothing is left for <HI>you</HI> to do for me. Every one has her direction, as to the la&s;t offices.&mdash;And my de&s;k, that I now write upon&mdash;O my deare&s;t Mrs. Norton, All is provided!&mdash;All is ready! And all will be as decent, as it &s;hould be!</P>
<P>And pray let my Mi&s;s Howe know, that by the time you will receive This, and &s;he <HI>your</HI> &s;ignification of the contents of it, it will, in all probability, be too late for <HI>her</HI> to do me the ine&s;timable favour, as I &s;hould once have
<PB N="182" REF="183">
thought it, to &s;ee me. <HI>God will have no rivals in the hearts of tho&s;e he &s;anctifies.</HI> By various methods he deadens all other &s;en&s;ations, or rather ab&s;orbs them all in the love of Him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall neverthele&s;s love <HI>you,</HI> my mamma Norton, and my Mi&s;s Howe, who&s;e love to me <HI>has pa&s;&s;ed the love of women,</HI> to my late&s;t hour!&mdash;But yet, I am now above the quick &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which once mo&s;t delighted me: And once more I &s;ay, that I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee ob|jects &s;o dear to me, which might bring me back again into &s;en&s;e, and rival my <HI>Supreme Love.</HI></P>
<P>TWICE have I been forced to leave off. I <HI>wi&s;hed,</HI> that my la&s;t writing might be to You, or to Mi&s;s Howe, if it might not be to my deare&s;t ma&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mamma,</HI> I would have wrote&mdash;Is the word di&s;tinct?&mdash;My eyes are <HI>&s;o</HI> mi&s;ty!&mdash;If, when I apply to you, I break off in half-words, do you &s;upply them&mdash;The kinde&s;t are your due.&mdash;Be &s;ure take the kinde&s;t, to fill up cha&s;ms with, if any cha&s;ms there be&mdash;</P>
<P>ANOTHER breaking off!&mdash;But the new day &s;eems to ri&s;e upon me with healing in its wings. I have gotten, I think, a recruit of &s;trength: Spirits, I ble&s;s God, I have not of late wanted.</P>
<P>Let my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Howe purcha&s;e her wedding gar|ments&mdash;And may all temporal ble&s;&s;ings attend the charm|ing preparation!&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings <HI>will,</HI> I make no que&s;tion, not|with&s;tanding the little cloudine&s;&s;es that Mr. Hickman en|counters with now-and-then, which are but progno&s;tics of a future golden day to him: For her heart is good, and her head not wrong&mdash;But great merit is coy, and that coyne&s;s has not always its foundation in pride: But, if it &s;hould <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be pride, take off the &s;kin-deep covering, and, in her, it is noble diffidence, and a love that wants but to be a&s;&s;ured!</P>
<P>Tell Mr. Hickman I write this, and write it, as I be|lieve, with my la&s;t pen; and bid him <HI>bear</HI> a little at fir&s;t, and <HI>forbear</HI>; and all the future will be crowning gratitude, and rewarding love: For Mi&s;s Howe has great &s;en&s;e, fine judgment, and exalted genero&s;ity; and can &s;uch a one

be ingrateful or ea&s;y under tho&s;e obligations which his a&s;&s;iduity and obligingne&s;s (when he &s;hall be &s;o happy as to call her his) will lay her under to him!</P>
<P>As for me, never bride was &s;o ready as I am. My wedding garments are bought&mdash;And tho' not fine or gawdy to the &s;ight, tho' not adorned with jewels, and &s;et off with gold and &s;ilver (for I have no beholders eyes to wi&s;h to glitter in) yet will they be the ea&s;ie&s;t, the <HI>happie&s;t</HI> &s;uit, that ever bridal maiden wore&mdash;for they are &s;uch as carry with them a &s;ecurity again&s;t all tho&s;e anxieties, pains, and perturbations, which &s;ometimes &s;ucceed to the mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing out&s;ettings.</P>

<P>I Am <HI>not</HI> the &s;avage which you and my wor&s;t enemies think me. My &s;oul is <HI>too much</HI> penetrated by the contents of the letter which you inclo&s;ed in your la&s;t, to &s;ay one word more to it, than that my heart has bled over it from every vein!&mdash;I will fly from the &s;ubject&mdash;But what other can I choo&s;e, that will not be as grievous, and lead into the &s;ame?</P>
<P>I could quarrel with all the world; with thee, as well as the re&s;t; obliging as thou &s;uppo&s;e&s;t thy&s;elf for writing to me hourly. How dared&s;t thou (tho' unknown to her) to pre&s;ume to take an apartment under the &s;ame roof with her?&mdash;I cannot bear to think, that thou

&s;hould&s;t be &s;een at all hours pa&s;&s;ing to and repa&s;&s;ing from her apartments, while <HI>I,</HI> who have &s;o much rea&s;on to call her mine, and once was preferred by her to all the world, am forced to keep aloof, and hardly dare to enter the <HI>city</HI> where &s;he is!</P>
<P>If there be any-thing in Brand's letter that will divert me, ha&s;ten it to me. But nothing now will ever divert me, will ever again give me joy or plea&s;ure! I can nei|ther eat, drink, nor &s;leep. I am &s;ick of all the world.</P>
<P>Surely it will be better when <HI>all is over</HI>&mdash;when I know the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> the fates can do again&s;t me&mdash;Yet how &s;hall I bear that <HI>wor&s;t?</HI>&mdash;O Belford, Belford! write it not to me; but, if it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> happen, get &s;omebody el&s;e to write; for I &s;hall cur&s;e the pen, the hand, the head, and the heart, em|ployed in communicating to me the fatal tidings. But what is this &s;aying, when already I cur&s;e the whole world except her&mdash;My&s;elf mo&s;t?</P>
<P>In fine, I am a mo&s;t mi&s;erable being. Life is a burden to me. I would not bear it upon the&s;e terms for one week more, let what would be my lot; for already is there a hell begun in my own mind. Never more mention to me, let <HI>her</HI> or who will &s;ay it, the <HI>pri&s;on</HI>&mdash;I cannot bear it&mdash;May damnation &s;eize quick the accur&s;ed woman, who could &s;et death upon taking that <HI>large &s;tride,</HI> as the dear creature calls it!&mdash;I had no hand in it! But her relations, her implacable relations, have done the bu&s;ine&s;s. All el&s;e would have been got over. Never per&s;uade me but it would. The fire of youth, and the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, would have pleaded for me to good purpo&s;e, with an in|dividual of a Sex, which loves to be addre&s;&s;ed with pa&s;&s;ion|ate ardor, even to tumult, had it not been for that cruelty and unforgivingne&s;s, which (the object and the penitence con&s;idered) have no example, and have aggravated the heinou&s;ne&s;s of my faults.</P>
<P>Unable to re&s;t, tho' I went not to bed till two, I di&s;|patch this ere the day dawn&mdash;Who knows what this night, this di&s;mal night, may have produced!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t after my me&s;&s;enger. I have told the varlet I will meet him, perhaps at Knight&s;bridge, perhaps in Pic|cadilly; and I tru&s;t not my&s;elf with pi&s;tols, not only on his account, but my own: For pi&s;tols are <HI>too ready</HI> a mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="186">I hope thou ha&s;t a letter ready for him. He goes to thy lodgings fir&s;t: For &s;urely thou wilt not pre&s;ume to take thy re&s;t in an apartment near hers. If he mi&s;s thee there, he flies to Smith's, and brings me word whether in being, or not.</P>

<P>THE lady remains exceedingly weak and ill. Her intellects, neverthele&s;s, continue clear and &s;trong, and her piety and patience are without example. Every one thinks this night will be her la&s;t. What a &s;hocking thing is that to &s;ay of &s;uch an excellence! She will not, however, &s;end away her letter to her Norton, as yet. She endeavoured in vain to &s;uper&s;cribe it: So de&s;ired me to do it. Her fingers will not hold her pen with the requi|&s;ite &s;teadine&s;s. She has, I fear, written and read her la&s;t!</P>

<P>SHE is &s;omewhat better than &s;he was. The Doctor has been here, and thinks &s;he will hold out yet a day or two. He has ordered her, as for &s;ome time pa&s;t, only &s;ome little cordials to take when ready to faint. She &s;eemed di&s;ap|pointed, when he told her, &s;he might yet live two or three days; and &s;aid, She longed for di&s;mi&s;&s;ion!&mdash;Life was not &s;o ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed, &s;he &s;aw, as &s;ome imagine.&mdash;<HI>Death from grief,</HI> was, &s;he believed, <HI>the &s;lowe&s;t of deaths.</HI> But God's will mu&s;t be done!&mdash;Her only prayer was now for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it: For &s;he doubted not but by the Divine
<PB N="186" REF="187">
goodne&s;s &s;he &s;hould be an happy creature, as &s;oon as &s;he could be dive&s;ted of the&s;e <HI>rags of mortality.</HI></P>
<P>Of her own accord &s;he mentioned you; which, till then, &s;he had avoided to do. She a&s;ked, with great &s;erenity, where you were?</P>
<P>I told her where; and your motives of being &s;o near; and read to her a few lines of yours of this morning, in which you mention your wi&s;hes to &s;ee her, your &s;incere affliction, and your re&s;olution not to approach her with|out her con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I would have read more; but &s;he &s;aid, Enough, Mr. Belford, enough!&mdash;Poor man! Does his con&s;cience begin to find him!&mdash;Then need not any-body to wi&s;h him a greater puni&s;hment!&mdash;May it work upon him to a happy purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>I took the liberty to &s;ay, that as &s;he was in &s;uch a frame, that nothing now &s;eemed capable of di&s;compo&s;ing her, I could wi&s;h that you might have the benefit of her exhorta|tions, which, I dared to &s;ay, while you were &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly affected, would have a greater force upon you than a thou|&s;and &s;ermons; and how happy you would think your&s;elf, if you could but receive her forgivene&s;s on your knees.</P>
<P>How can you think of &s;uch a thing, Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he, with &s;ome emotion? My compo&s;ure is owing, next to the Divine goodne&s;s ble&s;&s;ing my earne&s;t &s;upplications for it, to the <HI>not</HI> &s;eeing him. Yet let him know, that I now again repeat, that I forgive him.&mdash;And may God Almighty, cla&s;ping her fingers, and lifting up her eyes, forgive him too; and perfect his repentance, and &s;anctify it to him!&mdash;Tell him I &s;ay &s;o! And tell him, that if I could not &s;ay &s;o with my whole heart, I &s;hould be very unea&s;y, and think that my hopes of mercy to my&s;elf were but weakly founded; and that I had &s;till, in any harboured re&s;entments, &s;ome hankerings after a life which he has been the cau&s;e of &s;hortening.</P>
<P>The divine creature then turning a&s;ide her head&mdash;Poor man, &s;aid &s;he! I once could have loved him. This is &s;aying more than ever I could &s;ay of any other man out of my own family! Would he have permitted me to have been an humble in&s;trument to have made him good, I think I could have made him happy!&mdash;But tell him not
<PB N="187" REF="188">
this, if he be <HI>really</HI> penitent&mdash;It may too much affect him!&mdash;There &s;he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>Admirable creature!&mdash;Heavenly forgiver!&mdash;Then re|&s;uming&mdash;But pray tell him, that if I could know, that my death might be a means to reclaim and &s;ave him, it would be an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction to me!</P>
<P>But let me not, however, be made unea&s;y with the ap|prehen&s;ion of &s;eeing him. I cannot <HI>bear</HI> to &s;ee him!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he had done &s;peaking, the mini&s;ter, who had &s;o often attended her, &s;ent up his name; and was admitted.</P>
<P>Being apprehen&s;ive, that it would be with difficulty that you could prevail upon that impetuous &s;pirit of yours, not to invade her dying hours, and of the agonies into which a &s;urprize of this nature would throw her, I thought this gentleman's vi&s;it afforded a proper opportunity to re|new the &s;ubject; and (having a&s;ked her leave) acquainted him with the topic we had been upon.</P>
<P>The good man urged, That &s;ome conde&s;cen&s;ions were u&s;ually expected, on the&s;e &s;olemn occa&s;ions, from pious &s;ouls like hers, however &s;atisfied with <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> for the &s;ake of &s;hewing the <HI>world,</HI> and for <HI>example-&s;ake,</HI> that all re&s;entments again&s;t tho&s;e who had mo&s;t injured them were &s;ubdued: And if &s;he would vouch&s;afe to a heart &s;o truly penitent, as I had repre&s;ented Mr. Lovelace's to be, that <HI>per&s;onal</HI> pardon, which I had been pleading for, there would be no room to &s;uppo&s;e the lea&s;t lurking re&s;entment remained; and it might have very happy effects upon the gentleman.</P>
<P>I have no lurking re&s;entment, Sir, &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;This is not a time for re&s;entment: And you will be the readier to believe me, when I can a&s;&s;ure you (looking at me) that even what I have mo&s;t rejoiced in, the truly friendly love that has &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between my Mi&s;s Howe and her Clari&s;&s;a, altho' to my la&s;t ga&s;p it will be the deare&s;t to me of all that is dear in this life, has already abated of its fervor; has already given place to &s;upremer fervors: And &s;hall the remembrance of Mr. Lovelace's <HI>per&s;onal</HI> in&s;ults, which, I ble&s;s God, never corrupted that <HI>mind</HI> which her friend&s;hip &s;o much delighted, be &s;tronger in the&s;e hours with me, than the remembrance of a love as pure as the human heart ever boa&s;ted? Tell, therefore, the <HI>world,</HI> if
<PB N="188" REF="189">
you plea&s;e, and (if you think what I &s;aid to you before, Mr. Belford, not &s;trong enough) tell the poor man, that I not only forgive him, but have <HI>&s;uch</HI> earne&s;t wi&s;hes for the good of his &s;oul, and that from con&s;iderations of its immortality, that could my penitence avail for more &s;ins than my own, my la&s;t tear &s;hould fall for Him by whom I die!</P>
<P>Our eyes and hands expre&s;&s;ed for us both, what our lips could not utter.</P>
<P>Say not then, proceeded &s;he, nor let it be &s;aid, that my re&s;entments are un&s;ubdued!&mdash;And yet the&s;e eyes, lifted up to Heaven, as witne&s;s to the truth of what I have &s;aid, &s;hall never, if I can help it, behold him more!&mdash;For do ye not con&s;ider, Sirs, how &s;hort my time is; what much more important &s;ubjects I have to employ it upon; and how unable I &s;hould be (&s;o weak as I am) to contend even with the avowed penitence of a per&s;on in &s;trong health, governed by pa&s;&s;ions unabated, and always violent?&mdash;And now I hope you will never urge me more on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter &s;aid, It were pity ever to urge this plea again.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Lovelace, that I did not forget the office of a friend, in endeavouring to prevail upon her to give you her la&s;t forgivene&s;s per&s;onally. And I hope, as &s;he is &s;o near her end, you will not invade her in her la&s;t hours; &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t be extremely di&s;compo&s;ed at &s;uch an inter|view; and it might make her leave the world the &s;ooner for it.</P>
<P>This reminds me of an expre&s;&s;ion which &s;he u&s;ed on your barbarous hunting her at Smith's, on her return to her lodgings; and that with a &s;erenity unexampled (as Mrs. Lovick told me, con&s;idering the occa&s;ion, and the trouble given her by it, and her indi&s;po&s;ition at the time) He will not let me die decently, &s;aid the angelic &s;ufferer!&mdash;He will not let me enter into my Maker's pre&s;ence with the compo&s;ure that is required in entering into the draw|ing room of an earthly prince!</P>
<P>I cannot, however, forbear to wi&s;h, that the heavenly creature could have prevailed upon her&s;elf, in the&s;e her la&s;t hours, to &s;ee you; and that for my &s;ake, as well as yours:
<PB N="189" REF="190">
For altho' I am determined never to be guilty of the crimes, which have, till within the&s;e few pa&s;t weeks, blackened my former life; and for which, at pre&s;ent, I mo&s;t heartily hate my&s;elf; yet &s;hould I be le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of a re|lap&s;e, if (wrought upon by the &s;olemnity which &s;uch an interview mu&s;t have been attended with) you had become a reformed man: For no devil do I fear, but one in your &s;hape.</P>
<P>IT is now eleven o'clock at night. The lady, who re|tired to re&s;t an hour ago, is in a &s;weet &s;lumber, as Mrs. Lovick tells me.</P>
<P>I will clo&s;e here. I hope I &s;hall find her the better for it in the morning. Yet, alas! how frail is hope! How frail is life; when we are apt to build &s;o much on every &s;hadowy relief; altho' in &s;uch a de&s;perate ca&s;e as this, &s;itting down to reflect, we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> know, that it is <HI>but</HI> &s;hadowy!</P>
<P>I will inclo&s;e Brand's horrid pedantry. And for once am aforehand with thy ravenous impatience.</P>

<P>AND is &s;he &s;omewhat better?&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings upon thee without number or mea&s;ure!

<P>But who told this hard-hearted and death-pronouncing Doctor, that &s;he will hold it no longer? By what war|rant &s;ays he this? What pre&s;umption in the&s;e parading &s;olemn fellows of a college, which will be my contempt to the late&s;t hour of my life, if this brother of it (eminent

What mu&s;t be his art, if it could not wind it up in a quarter of the time he has attended her, when, at his fir&s;t vi&s;its, the &s;prings and wheels of life and motion were &s;o good, that they &s;eemed only to want common care and oiling!</P>
<P>I am obliged to you for endeavouring to engage her to &s;ee me. 'Twas like a friend. If &s;he had vouch&s;afed me that favour, &s;he &s;hould have &s;een at her feet the mo&s;t abject adorer that ever kneeled to ju&s;tly offended beauty.</P>

<P>You tell me in your letter, that at eleven o'clock &s;he had &s;weet re&s;t; and my &s;ervant acquaints me from Mrs. Smith, that &s;he has had a good night. What hopes does this fill me with!

<P>YOUR &s;ervant arrived here before I was &s;tirring. I &s;ent him to Smith's to inquire how the lady was; and ordered him to call upon me when he came back. I was plea&s;ed to hear &s;he had had tolerable re&s;t; and, as &s;oon as I had di&s;patched him with the letter I had written over|night, I went to attend her.</P>
<P>I found her up, and dre&s;s'd; in a white &s;atten night|gown. Ever elegant; but now more &s;o, than I had &s;een her for a week pa&s;t; her a&s;pect &s;erenely chearful.</P>
<P>She mentioned the increa&s;ed dimne&s;s of her eyes, and the tremor which had invaded her limbs. If this be dy|ing, &s;aid &s;he, there is nothing at all &s;hocking in it. My body hardly &s;en&s;ible of pain, my mind at ea&s;e, my intel|lects clear and perfect as ever. What a good and gracious God have I!&mdash;For this is what I always prayed for.</P>
<P>I told her, It was not &s;o &s;erene with you.</P>
<P>There is not the &s;ame rea&s;on for it, replied &s;he. 'Tis a choice comfort, Mr Belford, at the winding-up of our &s;hort &s;tory, to be able to &s;ay, I have rather <HI>&s;uffered</HI> in|juries <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> than <HI>offered</HI> them to <HI>others.</HI> I ble&s;s God, tho' I have been unhappy, as the <HI>world</HI> deems it, and once I thought more &s;o, than at pre&s;ent I do; yet have I not wilfully made any one creature &s;o. I have no rea&s;on to grieve for any-thing but for the &s;orrow I have given my friends.</P>
<P>But pray, Mr. Belford, remember me in the be&s;t man|ner to my cou&s;in Morden; and de&s;ire him to comfort them, and to tell them, that all would have been the &s;ame, had they accepted of my true penitence, as I wi&s;h as and I tru&s;t the Almighty has done.</P>
<P>I was called down: It was to Harry, who was ju&s;t re|turned from Mi&s;s Howe's, to whom he carried the lady's letter. The &s;tupid fellow, being bid to make ha&s;te with it, and return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, &s;taid not till Mi&s;s Howe had it, &s;he being at the di&s;tance of five miles, altho' Mrs. Howe would have had him &s;tay, and &s;ent a man and hor&s;e purpo&s;ely with it to her daughter.</P>

<P>THE poor lady is ju&s;t recovered from a fainting fit, which has left her at death's door. Her late tranquility and freedom from pain &s;eemed but a <HI>lightening,</HI> as Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith call it.</P>
<P>By my faith, Lovelace, I had rather part with all the friends I have in the world, than with this lady: I never knew what a virtuous, a holy friend&s;hip, as I may call mine to her, was before.

<P>LIKE Ae&s;op's traveller, thou blowe&s;t hot and cold, life and death, in the &s;ame breath, with a view, no doubt, to di&s;tract me. How familiarly do&s;t thou u&s;e the words, <HI>dying, dimne&s;s, tremor?</HI> Never did any mortal ring &s;o many changes on &s;o few bells. Thy true father, I dare &s;wear, was a butcher, or an undertaker, by the delight thou &s;eeme&s;t to take in &s;cenes of horror and death. Thy barbarous reflection, that thou lo&s;e&s;t her not by thy own fault, is never to be forgiven. Thou ha&s;t but one way to atone for the torments thou give&s;t me, and that is, by &s;end|ing me word that &s;he is better, and will recover. Whether it be true or not, let me be told &s;o, and I will go abroad rejoicing and believing it, and my wi&s;hes and imagination &s;hall make out all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>If &s;he live but one year, that I may acquit my&s;elf <HI>to</HI> my&s;elf (no matter for the world!) that her death is not owing to me, I will compound for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Will neither vows nor prayers &s;ave her? I never prayed in my life, put all the years of it together, as I have done for this fortnight pa&s;t: And I have mo&s;t &s;incerely repented of all my ba&s;ene&s;s to her&mdash;And will nothing do?</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">But after all, if &s;he recover not, this reflection mu&s;t be my comfort; and it is <HI>truth</HI>; That her departure will be owing rather to wilfulne&s;s, to downright female wilfulne&s;s, than to any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It is difficult for people who pur&s;ue the dictates of a vio|lent re&s;entment, to &s;top where fir&s;t they de&s;igned to &s;top.</P>
<P>I have the charity to believe, that even James and Ara|bella Harlowe, at fir&s;t, intended no more by the confe|deracy they formed again&s;t this their angel &s;i&s;ter, than to di&s;grace and keep her down, le&s;t (&s;ordid wretches!) their uncles &s;hould follow the example her grandfather had &s;et, to <HI>their</HI> detriment.</P>
<P>Many a man, who at fir&s;t intended only to try if a girl would re&s;ent a petty freedom, finding him&s;elf unchecked, or only lightly and laughingly put by, has been encou|raged to attempt the la&s;t point, and has triumphed where once he pre&s;umed not to make the mo&s;t di&s;tant approach but with fear and trembling and previous &s;tudy how to come off, in ca&s;e of a high re&s;entment.</P>
<P>To bring the&s;e illu&s;trations home; This lady, I &s;uppo&s;e, in her re&s;entment, intended only at fir&s;t to vex and plague me; and, finding &s;he could do it to purpo&s;e, her de&s;ire of revenge became &s;tronger in her than the de&s;ire of life; and now &s;he is willing to die, as an event which &s;he &s;up|po&s;es will cut my heart-&s;trings a&s;under. And &s;till the more to be revenged, puts on the Chri&s;tian, and forgives me.</P>
<P>But I'll have none of her forgivene&s;s! My own heart tells me, I do not de&s;erve it; and I cannot bear it!&mdash;And what is it, but a mere <HI>verbal</HI> forgivene&s;s, as o&s;tentatiou&s;ly as cruelly given with a view to magnify her&s;elf, and wound me deeper? A little, dear, &s;pecious&mdash;But let me &s;top&mdash;le&s;t I bla&s;pheme!</P>
<P>READING over the above, I am a&s;hamed of my ram|blings: But what would&s;t have me do?&mdash;See'&s;t thou not that I am but &s;eeking to run out of my&s;elf, in hope to lo&s;e my&s;elf; yet, that I am unable to do either?</P>

<P>DR. H. has ju&s;t been here. He tarried with me till the mini&s;ter had done praying by the lady; and then we were both admitted. Mr. Goddard (who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her) went away with them when they went.

<P>I will &s;et out this moment, little as the encouragement is, that you give me to do &s;o!&mdash;My mother is willing I &s;hould!&mdash;Why, O why, was &s;he not <HI>before</HI> willing!</P>
<P>Yet &s;he per&s;uades me too (le&s;t I &s;hould be fatally affected were I to find my fears too well ju&s;tified) to wait the re|turn of this me&s;&s;enger, who rides our &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;e&mdash;God &s;peed him with good news to me&mdash;El&s;e&mdash;But, Oh! my deare&s;t, deare&s;t friend, what el&s;e!&mdash;One line from your hand by him!&mdash;Send me but <HI>one</HI> line to bid me attend you!&mdash;I will &s;et out the moment, the very moment, I receive it.&mdash;I am now actually ready to do &s;o!&mdash;And if you love me, as I love you, the &s;ight of me will revive you to my hopes.

<P>The effect this letter had on the lady, who is &s;o near the end which the fair writer &s;o much apprehends and deplores, obliged Mrs. Lovick to make many breaks in reading it, and many changes of voice.</P>

Our Love then will have one and the &s;ame adorable object, and we &s;hall enjoy it and each other to all Eternity!</P>
<P>She &s;aid, her dear friend was &s;o earne&s;t for a line or two, that &s;he would fain write, if &s;he could: And &s;he tried; but to no purpo&s;e. She could dictate, however, &s;he be|lieved, and de&s;ired Mrs. Lovick would take pen and paper. Which &s;he did, and then &s;he dictated to <HI>her.</HI> I would have withdrawn; but at her de&s;ire &s;taid.</P>
<P>She wandered a good deal, at fir&s;t&mdash;She took notice that &s;he did&mdash;And when &s;he got into a little train, not plea&s;ing her&s;elf, &s;he apologized to Mrs. Lovick for making her begin again and again; and &s;aid, That third time &s;hould go, let it be as it would.</P>
<P>She dictated the farewel part, without he&s;itation; and when &s;he came to the ble&s;&s;ing and &s;ub&s;cription, &s;he took the pen, and dropping on her knees, &s;upported by Mrs. Lovick, wrote the conclu&s;ion; but Mrs. Lovick was forced to guide her hand.</P>

<P>I Had but ju&s;t time in my former, to tell you, that Co|lonel Morden was arrived. He was on hor&s;eback, attended by two &s;ervants, and alit at the door, ju&s;t as the clock &s;truck five. Mrs. Smith was then below in her back|&s;hop, weeping, her hu&s;band with her, who was as much affected as &s;he; Mrs. Lovick having left them a little be|fore, in tears likewi&s;e; for they had been bemoaning one another; joining in opinion, that the admirable lady would not live the night over. She had told them, it was <HI>her</HI> opi|nion too, from &s;ome numbne&s;&s;es, which &s;he called the fore|runners of death, and from an increa&s;ed inclination to doze.</P>
<P>The Colonel, as Mrs. Smith told me afterwards, a&s;ked with great impatience, the moment he alit, how Mi&s;s Har|lowe was? She an&s;wered, Alive; but, &s;he feared, drawing on apace. Good God! &s;aid he, with his hands and eyes lifted up. Can I &s;ee her? My name is Morden. I have the honour to be nearly related to her. Step up, pray; and let her know [She is &s;en&s;ible, I hope] that I am here. Who is with her?</P>
<P>No-body but her Nur&s;e, and Mrs. Lovick, a widow gentlewoman, who is as careful of her, as if &s;he were her mother.</P>
<P>And <HI>more</HI> careful too, interrupted he, or &s;he is not care|ful at all.&mdash;</P>
<P>Except a gentleman be with her, one Mr. Belford, con|tinued Mrs. Smith, who has been the be&s;t friend &s;he has had.</P>
<P>If Mr. Belford be with her, &s;urely I may&mdash;But, pray, &s;tep up, and let Mr. Belford know, that I &s;hall take it for a favour to &s;peak with him fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith came up to me in my new apartment. I had but ju&s;t di&s;patched your &s;ervant, and was a&s;king her nur&s;e, if I might be again admitted; who an&s;wered, that
<PB N="200" REF="201">
&s;he was dozing in the elbow-chair, having refu&s;ed to lie down, &s;aying, She &s;hould &s;oon, &s;he hoped, lie down for good.</P>
<P>The Colonel, who is really a fine gentleman, received me with great politene&s;s. After the fir&s;t compliments, My kin&s;woman, Sir, &s;aid he, is more obliged to you than to any of her own family. For my part, I have been endea|vouring to move &s;o many rocks in her favour; and, little thinking the dear creature &s;o very bad, have neglected to attend her, as I ought to have done the moment I ar|rived; and <HI>would,</HI> had I known how ill &s;he was, and what a ta&s;k I &s;hould have had with the family. But, Sir, your friend has been exce&s;&s;ively to blame; and you being &s;o <HI>intimately</HI> his friend, has made her fare the wor&s;e for your civilities to her. But is there no hope of her recovery?</P>
<P>The doctors have left her, with the melancholy decla|ration, that there is none.</P>
<P>Has &s;he had good attendance, Sir? A &s;kilful phy&s;ician? I hear the&s;e good folks have been very civil and obliging to her&mdash;</P>
<P>Who could be otherwi&s;e, &s;aid Mrs. Smith, weeping? She is the &s;weete&s;t lady in the world!</P>
<P>The character, &s;aid the Colonel, lifting up his eyes and one hand, that &s;he has from every living creature!&mdash;Good God! How could your accur&s;ed friend&mdash;</P>
<P>And how could her cruel parents, interrupted I?&mdash;We may as ea&s;ily account for <HI>him,</HI> as for <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>Too true! returned he, the vilene&s;s of the profligates of our &s;ex con&s;idered, whenever they can get any of the other into their power.</P>
<P>I &s;atisfied him about the care that had been taken of her; and told him of the friendly and even <HI>paternal</HI> attend|ance &s;he had had from Dr. H. and Mr. Goddard.</P>
<P>He was impatient to attend her, having not &s;een her, as he &s;aid, &s;ince &s;he was twelve years old; and that then &s;he gave promi&s;es of being one of the fine&s;t women in Eng|land.</P>
<P>She <HI>was</HI> &s;o, replied I, a very few months ago: And, tho' emaciated, &s;he will appear to you to have confirmed tho&s;e promi&s;es: For her features are &s;o regular and ex|act, her proportion &s;o fine, and her manner &s;o inimitably
<PB N="201" REF="202">
graceful, that were &s;he only &s;kin and bone, &s;he mu&s;t be a beauty.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith, at his reque&s;t, &s;tept up, and brought us down word, that Mrs. Lovick and her Nur&s;e were with her; and that &s;he was in &s;o &s;ound a &s;leep, leaning upon the former in her elbow-chair, that &s;he neither heard her enter the room, nor go out. The Colonel begged, if not improper, that he might &s;ee her, tho' &s;leeping. He &s;aid, That his impatience would not let him &s;tay till &s;he awaked. Yet he would not have her di&s;turbed; and &s;hould be glad to contemplate her &s;weet features, when &s;he &s;aw not him; and a&s;ked, If &s;he thought he could not go in, and come out, without di&s;turbing her?</P>
<P>She believ'd he might, &s;he an&s;wer'd; for her chair's back was towards the door.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, He would take care to withdraw, if &s;he awoke, that his &s;udden appearance might not &s;urpri&s;e her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith, &s;tepping up before us, bid Mrs. Lovick and the Nur&s;e not &s;tir, when we entered: And then we went up &s;oftly together.</P>
<P>We beheld the lady, in a charming attitude. Dre&s;&s;ed, as I told you before, in her virgin white, &s;he was &s;itting in her elbow-chair, Mrs. Lovick clo&s;e by her, in another chair, with her left arm round her neck, &s;upporting it, as it were; for, it &s;eems, the lady had bid her do &s;o, &s;aying, She had been a Mother to her, and &s;he would delight her&s;elf in thinking &s;he was in her Mamma's arms; for &s;he found her&s;elf drow&s;y; perhaps, &s;he &s;aid, for the la&s;t time &s;he &s;hould ever be &s;o.</P>
<P>One faded cheek re&s;ted upon the good woman's bo&s;om, the kindly warmth of which had over&s;pread it with a faint, but charming flu&s;h; the other paler, and hollow, as if al|ready iced over by death. Her hands, white as the lily, with her meandring veins more tran&s;parently blue, than ever I had &s;een even hers (veins &s;o &s;oon, alas! to be choaked up by the congealment of that purple &s;tream, which already &s;o languidly creeps rather than flows thro' them!) her hands hanging lifele&s;ly, one before her, the other gra&s;ped by the right-hand of the kind widow, who&s;e tears bedew'd the &s;weet face which her motherly bo&s;om &s;upported, though unfelt by the fair &s;leeper; and either in&s;en&s;ibly to the good woman, or what &s;he would not di&s;|turb
<PB N="202" REF="203">
her to wipe off, or to change her po&s;ture: Her a&s;pect was &s;weetly calm and &s;erene: And tho' &s;he &s;tarted now-and-then, yet her &s;leep &s;eemed ea&s;y; her breath indeed &s;hort and quick; but tolerably free, and not like that of a dying per&s;on.</P>
<P>In this heart-moving attitude &s;he appeared to us when we approached her, and came to have her lovely face be|fore us.</P>
<P>The Colonel &s;ighing often, gazed upon her with his arms folded, and with the mo&s;t profound and affectionate attention; till at la&s;t, on her &s;tarting, and fetching her breath with greater difficulty than before, he retired to a &s;creen, that was drawn before her <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> as &s;he calls it, which, as I have heretofore ob&s;erved, &s;tands under one of the windows. This &s;creen was placed there, at the time &s;he found her&s;elf obliged to take to her chamber; and in the depth of our concern, and the fulne&s;s of other di&s;|cour&s;e at our fir&s;t interview, I had forgotten to appri&s;e the Colonel of what he would probably &s;ee.</P>
<P>Retiring thither, he drew out his handkerchief, and, drowned in grief, &s;eemed unable to &s;peak: But, on ca&s;ting his eye behind the &s;creen, he &s;oon broke &s;ilence; for, &s;truck with the &s;hape of the coffin, he lifted up a purpli&s;h-coloured cloth that was &s;pread over it, and, &s;tarting back, Good God! &s;aid he, what's here!</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith &s;tanding next him, Why, &s;aid he, with great emotion, is my cou&s;in &s;uffered to indulge her &s;ad reflections with &s;uch an object before her?</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, reply'd the good woman, who &s;hould con|troul her? We are all &s;trangers about her, in a manner: And yet we have expo&s;tulated with her upon this &s;ad occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I ought, &s;aid I, (&s;tepping &s;oftly up to him, the lady again falling into a doze) to have appri&s;ed you of this. I was here when it was brought in, and never was &s;o &s;hocked in my life. But &s;he had none of her friends about her, and no rea&s;on to hope for any of them to come near her; and, a&s;&s;ured &s;he &s;hould not recover, &s;he was re&s;olved to leave as little as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;pecially as to what related to her per&s;on, to her executor. But it is not a &s;hocking object to her, tho' it be to every body el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">Cur&s;e upon the hard-heartedne&s;s of tho&s;e, &s;aid he, who occa&s;ion'd her to make &s;o &s;ad a provi&s;ion for her&s;elf! What mu&s;t her reflections have been, all the time &s;he was thinking of it, and giving orders about it? And what mu&s;t they be, every time &s;he turns her head towards it? The&s;e uncommon genius's&mdash;But indeed &s;he <HI>&s;hould</HI> have been con|trouled in it, had I been here.</P>
<P>The lady fetched a profound &s;igh, and, &s;tarting, it broke off our talk; and the Colonel then withdrew further be|hind the &s;creen, that his &s;udden appearance might not &s;urpri&s;e her.</P>
<P>Where am I! &s;aid &s;he. How drow&s;y I am! How long have I dozed? Don't go, Sir (for I was retiring). I am very &s;tupid, and &s;hall be more and more &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>She then offered to rai&s;e her&s;elf; but, being ready to faint thro' weakne&s;s, was forced to &s;it down again, re|clining her head on her chair-back; and, after a few mo|ments, I believe now, my good friends, &s;aid &s;he, all your kind trouble will &s;oon be over. I have &s;lept, but am not refre&s;hed, and my fingers ends &s;eem numb'd&mdash;have no feeling! (holding them up.)&mdash;'Tis time to &s;end the letter to my good Mrs. Norton.</P>
<P>Shall I, Madam, &s;end my &s;ervant po&s;t with it?</P>
<P>O no, Sir, I thank you. It will reach the dear woman too &s;oon (as &s;he will think) by the po&s;t.</P>
<P>I told her, this was not po&s;t-day.</P>
<P>Is it Wedne&s;day &s;till? &s;aid &s;he: Ble&s;s me! I know not how the time goes: But very tediou&s;ly, 'tis plain. And now I think I mu&s;t &s;oon take to my bed. All will be mo&s;t conveniently and with lea&s;t trouble over there&mdash;Will it not, Mrs. Lovick?&mdash;I think, Sir, turning to me, I have left nothing to the&s;e la&s;t incapacitating hours: Nothing either to &s;ay, or to do: I ble&s;s God, I have not: If I <HI>had,</HI> how unhappy &s;hould I be? Can you, Sir, remind me of any thing nece&s;&s;ary to be done or &s;aid to make your office ea&s;y?</P>
<P>If, Madam, your cou&s;in Morden &s;hould come, you would be glad to &s;ee him, I pre&s;ume?</P>
<P>I am too weak to wi&s;h to &s;ee my cou&s;in now. It would but di&s;compo&s;e me, and him too. Yet, if he come while I <HI>can</HI> &s;ee, I will &s;ee him, were it but to thank him for
<PB N="204" REF="205">
former favours, and for his pre&s;ent kind intentions to me. Has any body been here from him?</P>
<P>He has called, and will be here, Madam, in half an hour; but he feared to &s;urpri&s;e you.</P>
<P>Nothing can &s;urpri&s;e me now, except my Mamma were to favour me with her la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in per&s;on. That would be a welcome &s;urpri&s;e to me even yet. But did my Cou&s;in come purpo&s;ely to town to &s;ee me?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam. I took the liberty to let him know by a line la&s;t Monday, how ill you were.</P>
<P>You are very kind, Sir. I am and have been greatly obliged to you. But I think I &s;hall be pained to &s;ee him now, becau&s;e he will be concerned to &s;ee me. And yet, as I am not &s;o ill as I &s;hall pre&s;ently be&mdash;the &s;ooner he comes, the better. But if he come, what &s;hall I do about that &s;creen? He will chide me very probably; and I can|not bear chiding now. Perhaps (leaning upon Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith) I can walk into the next apartment to re|ceive him.</P>
<P>She motion'd to ri&s;e; but was ready to faint again, and forced to &s;it &s;till.</P>
<P>The Colonel was in a perfect agitation behind the &s;creen, to hear this di&s;cour&s;e; and twice, un&s;een by his cou&s;in, was coming from it towards her; but retreated, for fear of &s;urpri&s;ing her too much.</P>
<P>I &s;tept to him, and favoured his retreat; &s;he only &s;ay|ing, Are you going, Mr. Belford? Are you &s;ent for down? Is my Cou&s;in come? For &s;he heard &s;omebody &s;tep &s;oftly cro&s;s the room; and thought it me, her hearing being more perfect than her &s;ight.</P>
<P>I told her, I believed he was; and &s;he &s;aid, We mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it, Mrs. Lovick, and Mrs. Smith. I &s;hall otherwi&s;e mo&s;t grievou&s;ly &s;hock my poor cou&s;in: For he loved me dearly once. Pray give me a few of the doctor's la&s;t drops in water, to keep up my &s;pirits for this one in|terview; and that is all, I believe, that can concern me now.</P>
<P>The Colonel (who heard all this) &s;ent in his name; and I, pretending to go down to him, introduced the afflicted gentleman; &s;he having fir&s;t ordered the &s;creen to be put as clo&s;e to the window as po&s;&s;ible, that he might not &s;ee
<PB N="205" REF="206">
what was behind it; while he, having heard what &s;he had &s;aid about it, was determined to take no notice of it.</P>
<P>He folded the angel in his arms as &s;he &s;at, dropping down on one knee; for, &s;upporting her&s;elf upon the two elbows of the chair, &s;he attempted to ri&s;e, but could not. Excu&s;e, my dear Cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, excu&s;e me, that I can|not &s;tand up&mdash;I did not expect this favour now. But I am glad of this opportunity to thank you for all your generous goodne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>I never, my be&s;t beloved and deare&s;t cou&s;in, &s;aid he, (with eyes running over,) &s;hall forgive my&s;elf, that I did not attend you &s;ooner. Little did I think you were &s;o ill; nor do any of your friends believe it. If they did&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>If they did,</HI> repeated &s;he, interrupting him, I &s;hould have had more compa&s;&s;ion from them. I am &s;ure I &s;hould. But pray, Sir, how did you leave them? Are <HI>you</HI> recon|ciled to them? If you are not, I beg, if you love your poor Clari&s;&s;a, that you will: For every widen'd difference augments but my fault; &s;ince <HI>that</HI> is the foundation of all.</P>
<P>I had been expecting to hear from them in your favour, my dear cou&s;in, &s;aid he, for &s;ome hours, when this gen|tleman's letter arrived, which ha&s;tened me up: But I have the account of your grandfather's e&s;tate to make up with you, and have bills and draughts upon their banker for the &s;ums due to you; which they de&s;ire you may receive, le&s;t you &s;hould have occa&s;ion for money. And this is &s;uch an earne&s;t of an approaching reconciliation, that I dare to an&s;wer for all the re&s;t being according to your wi&s;hes, if&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! Sir, interrupted &s;he, with frequent breaks and pau&s;es, I wi&s;h, I wi&s;h, this does not rather &s;hew, that were I to live, they would have nothing more to &s;ay to me. I never had any pride in being independent of them: All my actions, when I might have made my&s;elf <HI>more</HI> inde|pendent, &s;hew this&mdash;But what avail the&s;e reflections now?&mdash;I only beg, Sir, that You, and <HI>this</HI> gentleman&mdash;to whom I am exceedingly obliged&mdash;will adju&s;t tho&s;e matters&mdash;ac|cording to the will I have written. Mr. Belford will ex|cu&s;e me; but it was in truth more nece&s;&s;ity than choice, that made me think of giving him the trouble he &s;o kindly accepts. Had I had the happine&s;s to &s;ee you, my cou&s;in, &s;ooner&mdash;or to know, that you &s;till honoured me with your
<PB N="206" REF="207">
regard&mdash;I &s;hould not have had the a&s;&s;urance to a&s;k this fa|vour of <HI>him</HI>&mdash;But&mdash;tho' the friend of Mr. Lovelace, he is a man of honour, and he will make peace rather than break it. And, my dear cou&s;in, let me beg of you&mdash;to con|tribute your part to it&mdash;and remember, that, while I have nearer relations than my cou&s;in Morden, dear as you are, and always were to me, you have no title to avenge my wrongs upon Him who has been the occa&s;ion of them. But I wrote to you my mind on this &s;ubject; and my rea|&s;ons; and hope I need not further urge them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t do Mr. Lovelace &s;o much ju&s;tice, an&s;wered he, wiping his eyes, as to witne&s;s, how &s;incerely he repents him of his ingrateful ba&s;ene&s;s to you, and how ready he is to make you all the amends in his power. He owns <HI>his</HI> wickedne&s;s, and <HI>your</HI> merit. If he did not, I could not pa&s;s it over, tho' you <HI>have</HI> nearer relations: For, my dear cou&s;in, did not your grandfather leave me in tru&s;t for you? And &s;hould I think my&s;elf concerned for your fortune, and not for your honour?&mdash;But, &s;ince he is &s;o de&s;irous to do you ju&s;tice, I have the le&s;s to &s;ay; and you may make your&s;elf intirely ea&s;y on that account.</P>
<P>I thank you, thank you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he: All is now as I wi&s;hed: But I am very faint, very low. I am &s;orry I cannot hold up; that I cannot better de&s;erve the honour of this vi&s;it: But it will not be&mdash;And &s;aying this, &s;he &s;unk down in her chair, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Hereupon we both withdrew, leaving word, that we would be at the Bedford-Head, if any thing extraordinary happened.</P>
<P>We be&s;poke a little repa&s;t, having neither of us dined; and, while it was getting ready, you may gue&s;s at the &s;ubject of our di&s;cour&s;e. Both joined in lamentation for the lady's de&s;perate &s;tate: Admired her manifold excel|lencies: Severely condemned you, and her friends. Yet, to bring him into better opinion of you, I read to him &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from your la&s;t letters, which &s;hew'd your concern for the wrongs you had done her, and your deep remor&s;e: And he &s;aid, It was a dreadful thing to labour under the &s;en&s;e of a guilt &s;o irremediable.</P>
<P>We procured Mr. Goddard (Dr. H. being not at home) once more to vi&s;it her, and to call upon us in his return.
<PB N="207" REF="208">
He was &s;o good as to do &s;o; but he tarried with her not five minutes; and told us, That &s;he was drawing on apace; that he feared &s;he would not live till morning; and that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee Colonel Morden directly.</P>
<P>The Colonel made excu&s;es where none were needed; and tho' our little refection was ju&s;t brought in, he went away immediately.</P>
<P>I could not touch a mor&s;el; and took pen and ink to amu&s;e my&s;elf, and oblige you, knowing how impatient you would be for a few lines: For, from what I have re|cited, you will &s;ee it was impo&s;&s;ible I could withdraw to write, when your &s;ervant came at half an hour after five, or have an opportunity for it till now; and <HI>This</HI> is acci|dental: And yet your poor fellow was afraid to go away with the verbal me&s;&s;age I &s;ent, importing, as no doubt he told you, that the Colonel was with us, the Lady exce&s;|&s;ively ill, and that I could not &s;tir to write a line.</P>

<P>THE Colonel being earne&s;t to &s;ee his cou&s;in as &s;oon as &s;he awaked, we were both admitted. We ob&s;erved in her, as &s;oon as we entered, &s;trong &s;ymptoms of her approach|ing di&s;&s;olution, notwith&s;tanding what the women had flattered us with, from her la&s;t night's tranquility. The Colonel and I, each loth to &s;ay what we thought, looked upon one another with melancholy countenances.</P>
<P>The Colonel told her, He &s;hould &s;end a &s;ervant to her uncle Antony's, for &s;ome papers he had left there; and a&s;ked, If &s;he had any commands that way?&mdash;She thought not, &s;he &s;aid, &s;peaking more inwardly than &s;he did the day before. She had indeed a letter ready to be &s;ent to her good Mrs. Norton; and there was a reque&s;t intimated in it. But it was time enough, if it were &s;ignified to tho&s;e whom it concerned, when all was over. However, it might be &s;ent then by the &s;ervant who was going that way. And &s;he cau&s;ed it to be given to the Colonel for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Her breath being very &s;hort, &s;he de&s;ired another pillow; and having two before, this made her in a manner &s;it up in her bed; and &s;he &s;poke then with more di&s;tinctne&s;s; and, &s;eeing us greatly concerned, forgot her own &s;uffer|ings to comfort us; and a charming lecture &s;he gave us, tho' a brief one, upon the happine&s;s of a timely prepa|tation, and upon the hazards of a late repentance, when the mind, as &s;he ob&s;erved, was &s;o much weakened, as
<PB N="209" REF="210">
well as the body, as to render a poor &s;oul unable to con|tend with its own infirmities.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech ye, my good friends, proceeded &s;he, mourn not for one who mourns not, nor has cau&s;e to mourn, for her&s;elf. On the contrary, rejoice with me, that all my worldly troubles are &s;o near their end. Believe me, Sirs, that I would not, if I might, choo&s;e to live, altho' the plea&s;ante&s;t part of my life were to come over again: And yet Eighteen years of it, out of Nineteen, have been <HI>very</HI> plea&s;ant.

<P>She made &s;ome excu&s;es to her <HI>cou&s;in,</HI> for having not been able to alter her will, to join him in the executor|&s;hip with me; and to <HI>me,</HI> for the trouble &s;he had given and yet &s;hould give me.</P>
<P>She had fatigued her&s;elf &s;o much (growing &s;en&s;ibly weaker) that &s;he &s;unk her head upon her pillows, ready to faint; and we withdrew to the window, looking upon one another; but could not tell what to &s;ay; and yet both &s;eemed inclinable to &s;peak: But the motion pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.

<P>The Colonel withdrew to di&s;mi&s;s his me&s;&s;enger, and &s;end away the letter to Mrs. Norton. I took the oppor|tunity to retire likewi&s;e; and to write thus far. And Joel returning, to take it; I now clo&s;e here.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LV. Mr. <HI>BELFORD.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THE Colonel tells me, That he has written to Mr. John Harlowe, by his &s;ervant,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That they might &s;pare them&s;elves the trouble of debating about a recon|ciliation; for that his dear cou&s;in would probably be no more, before they could re&s;olve.'</Q></P>
<P>He a&s;ked me after his cou&s;in's means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting; and whether &s;he had accepted of any favour from <HI>me:</HI> He was &s;ure, he &s;aid, &s;he would not from <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>I acquainted him with the truth of her parting with &s;ome of her apparel. This wrung his heart; and bitterly did he exclaim as well again&s;t you, as again&s;t her implacable relations.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed he had not come to England at all, or had come time enough; and hoped I would apprize him of the whole mournful &s;tory, at a proper &s;ea&s;on. He added, that he had thoughts when he came over, of fixing here for the remainder of his days: But now, as it was impo&s;|&s;ible his cou&s;in could recover, he would go abroad again, and re&s;ettle him&s;elf at Florence or Leghorn.</P>
<P>THE lady has been giving orders, with great pre&s;ence of mind, about her body: directing her nur&s;e and the maid of the hou&s;e to put her into her coffin as &s;oon as &s;he was cold. Mr. Belford, &s;he &s;aid, would know the re&s;t by her will.</P>
<P>SHE has ju&s;t now given from her bo&s;om, where &s;he al|ways wore it, a miniature picture, &s;et in gold, of Mi&s;s Howe: She gave it to Mrs. Lovick, de&s;iring her to fold it up in white paper, and direct it, <HI>To Charles Hickman, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI> and to give it to me, when &s;he was departed, for that gentleman.</P>
<P>She looked upon the picture, before &s;he gave it her&mdash;<HI>Sweet and ever-amiable friend&mdash;companion&mdash;&s;i&s;ter&mdash;lover!</HI> &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;And ki&s;&s;ed it four &s;everal times, once at each tender appellation.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="212">YOUR other &s;ervant is come.&mdash;Well may you be im|patient!&mdash;Well may you!&mdash;But do you think I can leave off in the middle of a conver&s;ation, to run and &s;et down what offers, and &s;end it away piecemeal as I write?&mdash;If I <HI>could,</HI> mu&s;t I not lo&s;e one half, while I put down the other?</P>
<P>This event is nearly as intere&s;ting to <HI>me</HI> as it is to <HI>you.</HI> If you are more grieved than I, there can be but one rea|&s;on for it; and that's at your heart! I had rather lo&s;e all the friends I have in the world (your&s;elf included,) than this divine lady; and &s;hall be unhappy when ever I think of her &s;ufferings, and her merit; tho' I have nothing to reproach my&s;elf upon the former.</P>
<P>I &s;ay not this, ju&s;t now, &s;o much to reflect upon you, as to expre&s;s my own grief; tho' your con&s;cience, I &s;uppo&s;e, will make you think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Your poor fellow, who &s;ays, that he begs for <HI>his life,</HI> in de&s;iring to be di&s;patched back with a letter, tears this from me.

<SALUTE>Dear Jack,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND by poor Lovelace's de&s;ire, for <HI>particulars</HI> of the fatal breviate thou &s;ente&s;t him this night. He can|not bear to &s;et pen to paper; yet wants to know every minute pa&s;&s;age of Mi&s;s Harlowe's departure. Yet, why he &s;hould, I cannot &s;ee; for, if &s;he is gone, &s;he is gone; and who can help it?</P>
<P>I never heard of &s;uch a woman in my life. What great matters has &s;he &s;uffered, that grief &s;hould kill her thus?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the poor fellow had never known her. From fir&s;t to la&s;t, what trouble has &s;he co&s;t him! The charming fellow has been half lo&s;t to us, ever &s;ince he pur&s;ued her. And what is there in one woman more than another, for matter of that?</P>
<P>It was well we were with him when your Note came. You &s;hewed your true friend&s;hip in your fore&s;ight. Why, Jack, the poor fellow was quite be&s;ide him&s;elf&mdash;Mad as any man ever was in Bedlam.</P>
<P>Will brought him the letter, ju&s;t after we had joined him, at the Bohemia-Head, where he had left word at the Ro&s;e at Knight&s;bridge he &s;hould be; for he had been &s;auntering up and down, backwards and forwards, ex|pecting us, and his fellow. Will, as &s;oon as he delivered it, got out of his way; and when he opened it, never was &s;uch a piece of &s;cenery. He trembled like a devil at receiving it: Fumbled at the &s;eal, his fingers in a pal&s;y, like Tom Doleman's; his hand &s;hake, &s;hake, &s;hake, that
<PB N="214" REF="215">
he tore the letter in two, before he could come at the con|tents: And, when he had read them, off went his hat to one corner of the room, his wig to the other&mdash;Damna|tion &s;eize the world! and a whole volley of &s;uch-like <HI>exe|cratious</HI> wi&s;hes; running up and down the room, and throwing up the &s;a&s;h, and pulling it down, and &s;miting his forehead with his double fi&s;t, with &s;uch force as would have felled an ox, and &s;tamping and tearing, that the landlord ran in, and fa&s;ter out again. And this was the di&s;traction-&s;cene for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>In vain was all Jemmy or I could &s;ay to him. I offered once to take hold of his hands, becau&s;e he was going to do him&s;elf a mi&s;chief, as I believed, looking about for his pi&s;tols, which he had laid upon the table, but which Will. un&s;een, had taken out with him [a faithful hone&s;t dog, that Will, I &s;hall for ever love the fellow for it] and he hit me a damned dow&s;e of the chops, as made my no&s;e bleed. 'Twas well 'twas he; for I hardly knew how to take it.</P>
<P>Jemmy raved at him, and told him, How wicked it was in him, to be &s;o bruti&s;h to abu&s;e a friend, and run mad for a woman. And then he &s;aid, he was &s;orry for it; and then Will ventured in with water and a towel; and the dog rejoiced, as I could &s;ee by his looks, that I <HI>had it</HI> ra|ther than he.</P>
<P>And &s;o, by degrees, we brought him a little to his rea|&s;on, and he promi&s;ed to behave more like a man. And &s;o I forgave him: And we rode on in the dark to here at Doleman's. And we all try'd to &s;hame him out of his mad ungovernable fooli&s;hne&s;s: For we told him, as how &s;he was but a woman, and an ob&s;tinate, perver&s;e woman too; and how could he help it?</P>
<P>And you know, Jack, [As we told him, moreover] that it was a &s;hame to manhood, for a man, who had &s;erved twenty and twenty women as bad or wor&s;e, let him have &s;erved Mi&s;s Harlowe never &s;o bad, &s;hould give him|&s;elf &s;uch <HI>ob&s;tropulous</HI> airs, becau&s;e &s;he would die: And we advi&s;ed him never to attempt a woman proud of her cha|racter and <HI>virtue,</HI> as they call it, any more: For why? The conque&s;t did not pay trouble; and what was there in
<PB N="215" REF="216">
one woman more than another? Hay you know, Jack!&mdash;And thus we comforted him, and advi&s;ed him.</P>
<P>But yet his damned addled pate runs upon this lady as much now &s;he's dead, as it did when &s;he was living. For, I &s;uppo&s;e, Jack, it is no joke. She is certainly and <HI>bona fide</HI> dead; i'n't &s;he? If not, thou de&s;erve&s;t to be doubly damned for thy fooling, I tell thee that. So he will have me write for particulars of her <HI>departure.</HI></P>
<P>He won't bear the word <HI>dead</HI> on any account. A &s;quea|mi&s;h puppy! How Love unmans, and &s;oftens, and ener|vates! And &s;uch a <HI>noble</HI> fellow as this too! Rot him for an idiot, and an oaf! I have no patience with the fooli&s;h <HI>duncical</HI> dog&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, I have not!</P>
<P>So &s;end the account, and let him howl over it, as I &s;up|po&s;e he will.</P>
<P>But he mu&s;t and &s;hall go abroad: And in a month or two Jemmy, and you, and I, will join him, and he'll &s;oon get the better of this chicken-hearted folly, never fear; and will then be a&s;hamed of him&s;elf: And then we'll not &s;pare him; tho' <HI>now,</HI> poor fellow, it were pity to lay him on &s;o thick, as he de&s;erves. And do thou, till then, &s;pare all reflections upon him; for, it &s;eems, thou ha&s;t <HI>worked</HI> him unmercifully.</P>
<P>I was willing to give thee &s;ome account of the hand we have had with the tearing fellow, who had certainly been a lo&s;t man, had we not been with him; or he would have killed &s;omebody or other&mdash;I have no doubt of it. And <HI>now</HI> he is but very middling; &s;its grinning like a man in &s;traw; cur&s;es and &s;wears, and is confounded gloomy; and creeps into holes and corners, like an old hedghog hunted for his grea&s;e. And &s;o adieu, Jack. Tourville and all of us wi&s;h for thee; for no one has the influence upon him that thou ha&s;t.</P>

<P>I MAY as well try to write; &s;ince, were I to go to bed, I &s;hall not &s;leep. I never had &s;uch a weight of grief upon my mind in my life, as upon the demi&s;e of this ad|mirable woman; who&s;e &s;oul is now rejoicing in the regions of light.</P>
<P>You may be glad to know the particulars of her happy exit. I will try to proceed; for all is hu&s;h and &s;till; the family retired; but not one of them, and lea&s;t of all her poor cou&s;in, I dare &s;ay, to re&s;t.</P>
<P>At four o'clock, as I mentioned in my la&s;t, I was &s;ent for down; and, as thou u&s;ed&s;t to like my de&s;criptions, I will give thee the woeful &s;cene that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to me, as I approached the bed.</P>
<P>The Colonel was the fir&s;t that took my attention, kneel|ing on the &s;ide of the bed, the lady's right-hand in both his, which his face covered, bathing it with his tears; altho' &s;he had been comforting him, as the women &s;ince told him, in elevated &s;trains, but broken accents.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the bed &s;at the good Widow; her face overwhelmed with tears, leaning her head again&s;t the bed's head in a mo&s;t di&s;con&s;olate manner; and turning her face to me, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, O Mr. Belford, cried &s;he, with folded hands&mdash;The dear lady&mdash;a heavy &s;ob not permitting her to &s;ay more.</P>
<P>Mrs. Smith, with cla&s;ped fingers, and uplifted eyes, as if imploring help from the Only Power which could give it, was kneeling down at the bed's feet, tears in large drops trickling down her cheeks.</P>
<P>Her Nur&s;e was kneeling between the widow and Mrs. Smith, her arms extended. In one hand &s;he held an ineffectual cordial, which &s;he had ju&s;t been offering to her dying mi&s;tre&s;s; her face was &s;woln with weeping (tho' u&s;ed to &s;uch &s;cenes as this) and &s;he turned her eyes to|wards me, as if &s;he called upon me by them to join in the helple&s;s &s;orrow; a fre&s;h &s;tream bur&s;ting from them as I approached the bed.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="218">The maid of the hou&s;e, with her face upon her folded arms, as &s;he &s;tood leaning again&s;t the wain&s;cot, more audibly expre&s;&s;ed her grief than any of the others.</P>
<P>The lady had been &s;ilent a few minutes, and &s;peechle&s;s as they thought, moving her lips without uttering a word; one hand, as I &s;aid, in her cou&s;in's. But when Mrs. Lo|vick on my approach pronounced my name, Oh! Mr. Belford, &s;aid &s;he, in broken periods; and with a faint in|ward voice, but very di&s;tinct neverthele&s;s&mdash;Now!&mdash;Now!&mdash;(I ble&s;s God for his mercies to his poor creature) will all &s;oon be over&mdash;A few&mdash;A very few moments&mdash;will end this &s;trife&mdash;And I &s;hall be happy!</P>
<P>Comfort here, Sir&mdash;turning her head to the Colonel&mdash;Comfort my cou&s;in&mdash;See!&mdash;the blameable kindne&s;s&mdash;He would not wi&s;h me to be happy&mdash;&s;o <HI>&s;oon!</HI></P>
<P>Here, &s;he &s;topt, for two or three minutes, earne&s;tly looking upon him: Then re&s;uming, My deare&s;t cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, be comforted&mdash;What is dying but the common lot?&mdash;The mortal frame may <HI>&s;eem</HI> to labour&mdash;But that is all!&mdash;It is not &s;o hard to die, as I believed it to be!&mdash;The preparation is the difficulty&mdash;I ble&s;s God, I have had time for That&mdash;The re&s;t is wor&s;e to beholders, than to me!&mdash;I am all ble&s;&s;ed hope&mdash;Hope it&s;elf.</P>
<P>She <HI>looked</HI> what &s;he &s;aid, a &s;weet &s;mile beaming over her countenance.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;ilence, Once more, my dear cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, but &s;till in broken accents, commend me mo&s;t dutifully to my Father and Mother&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt.

<P>She was &s;ilent for a few moments, lifting up her eyes, and the hand her cou&s;in held not between his. Then, <HI>O death!</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>where is thy &s;ting!</HI> [The words I remember to have heard in the Burial-&s;ervice read over my Uncle and poor Belton]. And after a pau&s;e&mdash;<HI>It is good for me that I was afflicted!</HI>&mdash;Words of Scripture, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Then turning towards us, who were lo&s;t in &s;peechle&s;s &s;orrow&mdash;O dear, <HI>dear</HI> gentlemen, &s;aid &s;he, you know not
<PB N="218" REF="219">
what <HI>foreta&s;tes</HI>&mdash;what <HI>a&s;&s;urances.</HI> And there &s;he again &s;topt, and looked up, as if in a thankful rapture, &s;weetly &s;miling.</P>
<P>Then turning her head towards me&mdash;Do <HI>you,</HI> Sir, tell your friend, that I forgive him! And I pray to God to for|give him!&mdash;Again pau&s;ing, and lifting up her eyes, as if praying that He would&mdash;Let him know how happily I die.&mdash;And that &s;uch as my own, I wi&s;h to be his la&s;t hour.</P>
<P>She was again &s;ilent for a few moments: And then re|&s;uming&mdash;My &s;ight fails me!&mdash;Your voices only&mdash;[for we both applauded her chri&s;tian, her divine frame, tho' in accents as broken as her own] And the voice of grief is alike in all. Is not this Mr. Morden's hand? pre&s;&s;ing one of his with that he had ju&s;t let go. Which is Mr. Bel|ford's? holding out the other. I gave her mine. God Almighty ble&s;s you both, &s;aid &s;he, and make you both&mdash;in your la&s;t hour&mdash;for you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> come to this&mdash;happy as I am.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed again, her breath growing &s;horter; and, after a few minutes, And now, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, give me your hand&mdash;nearer&mdash;&s;till nearer&mdash;drawing it towards her; and &s;he pre&s;&s;ed it with her dying lips&mdash;God protect you, dear, dear Sir&mdash;And once more, receive my be&s;t and mo&s;t grateful thanks&mdash;And tell my dear Mi&s;s Howe&mdash;and vouch&s;afe to &s;ee, and to tell my worthy Mrs. Nor|ton&mdash;She will be one day, I fear not, tho' now lowly in her fortunes, a Saint in Heaven&mdash;Tell them both, that I remember them with thankful ble&s;&s;ings in my la&s;t moments!&mdash;And pray God to give them happine&s;s here for many, many years, for the &s;ake of their friends and lovers; and an heavenly crown hereafter; and &s;uch a&s;&s;urances of it, as I have, thro' the all-&s;atisfying merits of my ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer.</P>
<P>Her &s;weet voice and broken periods methinks &s;till fill my ears, and never will be out of my memory.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;ilence, in a more broken and faint accent;&mdash;And you, Mr. Belford, pre&s;&s;ing my hand, may God pre|&s;erve you and make you &s;en&s;ible of all your errors&mdash;You &s;ee, in me, how All ends&mdash;May <HI>you</HI> be&mdash;And down &s;unk her head upon her pillow, &s;he fainting away, and drawing from us her hands.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="220">We thought &s;he was then gone; and each gave way to a violent bur&s;t of grief.</P>
<P>But &s;oon &s;hewing &s;igns of returning life, our attention was again engaged; and I be&s;ought her, when a little recovered, to complete in my favour her half-pronounced ble&s;&s;ing. She waved her hand to us both, and bowed her head &s;ix &s;everal times, as we have &s;ince recollected, as if di&s;tingui&s;h|ing every per&s;on pre&s;ent; not forgetting the nur&s;e and the maid-&s;ervant; the latter having approached the bed, weep|ing, as if crowding in for the divine lady's la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; and &s;he &s;poke faltering and inwardly,&mdash;Ble&s;s&mdash;ble&s;s&mdash;ble&s;s&mdash;you All&mdash;And now&mdash;And now&mdash;(holding up her almo&s;t lifele&s;s hands for the la&s;t time) Come&mdash;O come&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed Lord&mdash;JESUS!</P>
<P>And with the&s;e words, the la&s;t but half-pronounced, ex|pired: Such a &s;mile, &s;uch a charming &s;erenity over-&s;pread|ing her &s;weet face at the in&s;tant as &s;eemed to manife&s;t her eternal happine&s;s already begun.</P>
<P>O Lovelace!&mdash;But I can write no more!</P>
<P>I RESUME my pen to add a few lines.</P>
<P>While warm, tho' pul&s;ele&s;s, we pre&s;&s;ed each her hand with our lips; and then retired into the next room.</P>
<P>We looked at each other, with intent to &s;peak: But, as if one motion governed as one cau&s;e affected both, we turned away &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The Colonel &s;ighed as if his heart would bur&s;t: At la&s;t, his face and hands uplifted, his back towards me, Good Heaven! &s;aid he to him&s;elf, &s;upport me!&mdash;And is it thus, O Flower of Nature!&mdash;Then pau&s;ing&mdash;And mu&s;t we no more&mdash;<HI>Never more!</HI>&mdash;My ble&s;&s;ed, ble&s;&s;ed cou&s;in! utter|ing &s;ome other words, which his &s;ighs made inarticulate:&mdash;And then, as if recollecting him&s;elf&mdash;Forgive me, Sir!&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Mr. Belford; and &s;liding by me; anon I hope to &s;ee you, Sir&mdash;And down &s;tairs he went, and out of the hou&s;e, leaving me a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>When I recovered my&s;elf, it was almo&s;t to repine at what I <HI>then</HI> called an unequal di&s;pen&s;ation; forgetting her happy preparation, and &s;till happier departure; and that &s;he had but drawn a common lot, triumphing in it; and leaving behind her, every one le&s;s a&s;&s;ured of happi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="220" REF="221">
tho' equally certain that it would one day be their own lot.</P>
<P>She departed exactly at 40 minutes after 6 o'clock, as by her watch on the table.</P>
<P>And thus died Mi&s;s CLARISSA HARLOWE, in the blo&s;|&s;om of her youth and beauty: And who, her tender years con&s;idered, has not left behind her her &s;uperior in ex|ten&s;ive knowlege, and watchful prudence; nor hardly her equal for unblemi&s;hed virtue, exemplary piety, &s;weet|ne&s;s of manners, di&s;creet genero&s;ity, and true chri&s;tian charity: And the&s;e all &s;et off by the mo&s;t graceful mo|de&s;ty and humility; yet on all proper occa&s;ions mani|fe&s;ting a noble pre&s;ence of mind and true magnanimity: So that &s;he may be &s;aid to have been not only an ornament to her Sex, but to Human nature.</P>
<P>A better pen than mine may do her fuller ju&s;tice:&mdash;Thine, I mean, O Lovelace! For well do&s;t thou know how much &s;he excelled in the graces both of mind and per|&s;on, natural and acquired, all that is woman. And thou al&s;o can&s;t be&s;t account for the cau&s;es of her immature death, thro' tho&s;e calamities which in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time from the highe&s;t pitch of felicity (every one in a manner adoring her) brought her to an exit &s;o happy for her&s;elf, but, that it was &s;o <HI>early,</HI> &s;o much to be deplored by all who had the honour of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>This ta&s;k, then, I leave to thee: But now I can write no more, only that I am a &s;ympathizer in every part of thy di&s;tre&s;s, except (and yet it is cruel to &s;ay it) in That which ari&s;es from thy guilt.</P>

<P>AT length, my be&s;t beloved Mi&s;s Clary, every thing is in the wi&s;hed train&mdash;For all your relations are unanimous in your favour&mdash;Even your brother and &s;i&s;ter are with the foremo&s;t to be reconciled to you.</P>
<P>I knew it mu&s;t end thus!&mdash;By patience, and per&s;ever|ing &s;weetne&s;s, what a triumph have you gained!</P>
<P>This happy change is owing to letters received from your phy&s;ician, from your cou&s;in Morden, and from Mr. Brand.</P>
<P>Colonel Morden will be with you no doubt before this can reach you, with his pocket-book filled with money-bills, that nothing may be wanting to make you ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="223">And <HI>now,</HI> all our hopes, all our prayers are, that this good news may re&s;tore you to &s;pirits and health; and that (&s;o long with-held) it may not come too late.</P>
<P>I know how much your dutiful heart will be rai&s;ed with the joyful tidings I write you, and &s;till &s;hall more particularly tell you of, when I have the happine&s;s to &s;ee you: Which will be by next Saturday, at furthe&s;t; per|haps on Friday afternoon, by the time you can receive this.</P>
<P>For this day, by the general voice, being &s;ent for, I was received by every one with great goodne&s;s and con|de&s;cen&s;ion, and <HI>intreated</HI> (for that was the word they were plea&s;ed to u&s;e, when I needed <HI>no</HI> intreaty, I am &s;ure) to ha&s;ten up to you, and to a&s;&s;ure you of all their affectionate regards to you: And your father bid me &s;ay all the kind things that were in my <HI>heart</HI> to &s;ay, in order to comfort and rai&s;e you up; and they would hold them&s;elves bound to make them good.</P>
<P>How agreeable is this commi&s;&s;ion to your Norton! My heart will overflow with kind &s;peeches, never fear!&mdash;I am already meditating what I &s;hall &s;ay, to chear and rai&s;e you up, in the names of every one dear and near to you. And &s;orry I am, that I cannot this moment &s;et out, as I might, in&s;tead of writing, would they favour my eager impatience with their chariot; but as it was not offered, it would be pre&s;umption to have a&s;ked for it: And to|morrow a hired chai&s;e and pair will be ready; but at what hour I know not.</P>
<P>How I long once more to fold my dear precious young lady to my fond, my <HI>more</HI> than fond, my <HI>maternal</HI> bo&s;om!</P>
<P>Your Si&s;ter will write to you, and &s;end her letter, with This, by a particular hand.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not let them &s;ee what I write, becau&s;e of my wi&s;h about the chariot.</P>
<P>Your uncle Harlowe will al&s;o write, and (I doubt not) in the kinde&s;t terms: For they are all extremely alarmed and troubled at the dangerous way your doctor repre&s;ents you to be in; as well as delighted with the character he gives you. Would to heaven the good gentleman had written <HI>&s;ooner!</HI> And yet he writes, that you know not he has <HI>now</HI> written. But it is all our confidence, and our
<PB N="223" REF="224">
con&s;olation, that he would not have written at all, had he thought it too late.</P>
<P>They will pre&s;cribe no conditions to you, my dear young lady; but will leave all to your own duty and di&s;cretion. Only your brother and &s;i&s;ter declare, they will never yield to call Mr. Lovelace brother: Nor will your father, I believe, be ea&s;ily brought to think of him for a &s;on.</P>
<P>I am to bring you down with me as &s;oon as your health and inclination will permit. You will be received with open arms. Every one longs to &s;ee you. All the &s;ervants plea&s;e them&s;elves, that they &s;hall be permitted to ki&s;s your hands. The pert Betty's note is already changed; and &s;he now runs over in your ju&s;t prai&s;es. What friends does pro&s;perity make! What enemies adver&s;ity! It always was, and always will be &s;o, in every &s;tate of life from the throne to the cottage&mdash;But let all be forgotten now on this jubilee change: And may you, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s, be capable of rejoicing in this good news; as I know you <HI>will</HI> rejoice, if capable of any thing.</P>
<P>God pre&s;erve you to our happy meeting! And I will, if I may &s;ay &s;o, weary Heaven with my ince&s;&s;ant prayers to pre&s;erve and re&s;tore you afterwards!</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Si&s;ter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have ju&s;t heard that you are exceedingly ill. We all loved you as never young creature was loved: You are &s;en&s;ible of That, Si&s;ter Clary. And you have been very naughty&mdash;But we could not be angry always.</P>

<P>Take comfort therefore, Si&s;ter Clary; and don't be too much ca&s;t down&mdash;Whatever your mortifications may be from &s;uch noble pro&s;pects over-clouded, and from the re|flections you will have from within, on your faulty &s;tep, and from the &s;ullying of &s;uch a charming character by it, you will receive none from any of us: And, as an earne&s;t of your Papa's and Mamma's favour and reconciliation, they a&s;&s;ure you by me of their Ble&s;&s;ing and hourly prayers.</P>
<P>If it will be any comfort to you, and my mother finds this letter is received as we expect (which we &s;hall know by the good effect it will have upon your health) &s;he will her&s;elf go to town to you.

<P>I hope you'll rejoice at this good news. Pray let us hear that you do.

<P>We know your talents, my dear, and how movingly you could write, whenever you plea&s;ed; &s;o that nobody could ever deny you any thing; and, believing you depended on your pen, and little thinking you were &s;o ill, and that you had lived &s;o regular a life, and were &s;o truly pe|nitent, are much troubled every one of us, your brother and all, for being &s;o &s;evere.

<P>I Will now take up the account of our proceedings from my letter of la&s;t night, which contained the dying words of this incomparable lady.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had &s;een the la&s;t &s;cene clo&s;ed (&s;o ble&s;&s;edly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">) we left the body to the care of the good wo|men, who, according to the orders &s;he had given them that very night, removed her into that la&s;t hou&s;e which &s;he had di&s;play'd &s;o much fortitude in providing.</P>
<P>In the morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, according to appointment, the Colonel came to me here. He was very much out of order. We went together, accompanied by Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, into the decea&s;ed's cham|ber.

We could not help taking a view of the lovely corp&s;e, and admiring the charming &s;erenity of her noble a&s;pect. The women declared, they never &s;aw death &s;o lovely be|fore; and that &s;he looked as if in an ea&s;y &s;lumber, the colour having not quite left her cheeks and lips.</P>
<P>I unlocked the drawer, in which (as I mentioned in a <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Page 167.</NOTE> former) &s;he had depo&s;ited her papers.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Take this la&s;t and &s;olemn occa&s;ion to repeat to you my thanks for all your kindne&s;s to me at a time when I mo&s;t needed countenance and protection.</P>
<P>A few con&s;iderations I beg leave, as <HI>now,</HI> at your peru&s;al of This, from the dead, to pre&s;s upon you, with all the warmth of a &s;incere friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>By the time you will &s;ee This, you will have had an in|&s;tance, I humbly tru&s;t, of the comfortable importance of a pacified con&s;cience, in the la&s;t hours of one, who, <HI>to</HI> the la&s;t hour, will wi&s;h your eternal welfare.</P>
<P>The great Duke of Luxemburgh, as I have heard, on his death-bed, declared, That he would then much rather have had it to reflect upon, that he had admini&s;tered a cup of cold water to a worthy poor creature in di&s;tre&s;s, than that he had won &s;o many battles as he had triumphed for&mdash;And, as one well ob&s;erves, All the &s;entiments of worldly grandeur vani&s;h at that unavoidable moment which decides the de&s;tiny of all men.</P>
<P>If then, Sir, at the tremendous hour, it be thus with the conquerors of armies, and the &s;ubduers of nations, let me, in very few words (many are not needed) a&s;k,
<PB N="227" REF="228">
What, at That period, mu&s;t be the reflections of tho&s;e (if capable of reflection) who have lived a life of &s;en&s;e and offence; who&s;e &s;tudy and who&s;e pride mo&s;t ingloriou&s;ly has been to &s;educe the innocent, and to ruin the weak, the unguarded, and the friendle&s;s; made &s;till more friendle&s;s by <HI>their</HI> ba&s;e &s;eductions?&mdash;Oh! Mr. Belford, weigh, pon|der, and reflect upon it, now, that in health, and in vigour of mind and body, the reflections will mo&s;t avail you&mdash;What an ingrateful, what an unmanly, what a meaner than reptile pride is this!</P>
<P>In the next place, Sir, let me beg of you, for <HI>my &s;ake,</HI> who AM, or, as <HI>now</HI> you will be&s;t read it, <HI>have been,</HI> driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to you to be the Executor of my will, that you will bear, according to that genero&s;ity which I think to be in you, with all my friends, and par|ticularly with my brother (who is really a worthy young man, but perhaps a little too head&s;trong in his fir&s;t re&s;ent|ments and conceptions of things) if any thing, by rea&s;on of this tru&s;t, &s;hould fall out di&s;agreeably; and that you will &s;tudy to make peace, and to reconcile all parties; and more e&s;pecially, that you, who &s;eem to have a great in|fluence upon your <HI>&s;till more</HI> head&s;trong friend, will inter|po&s;e, if occa&s;ion be, to prevent <HI>further</HI> mi&s;chief&mdash;For &s;urely, Sir, that violent &s;pirit may &s;it down &s;atisfied with the evils he has already wrought; and, particularly, with the wrongs, the heinous and ignoble wrongs, he has in me done to my family, wounded in the tendere&s;t part of its honour.</P>
<P>To this reque&s;t I have already your repeated promi&s;e. I claim the ob&s;ervance of it, therefore, as a debt from you: And tho' I hope I need not doubt it, yet was I willing, on this &s;olemn, this <HI>la&s;t</HI> occa&s;ion, thus earne&s;tly to reinforce it.</P>
<P>I have another reque&s;t to make to you; It is only, That you will be plea&s;ed, by a particular me&s;&s;enger, to forward the inclo&s;ed letters as directed.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, having the pre&s;umption to think, that an <HI>u&s;eful</HI> member is lo&s;t to &s;ociety by means of the unhappy &s;tep which has brought my life &s;o &s;oon to its period, let me hope, that I may be an humble in&s;trument in the hands of Providence, to reform a man of your parts and abilities;
<PB N="228" REF="229">
and then I &s;hall think that lo&s;s will be more abundantly repaired to the world, while it will be, by God's good|ne&s;s, my gain: And I &s;hall have this further hope, that once more I &s;hall have an opportunity, in a ble&s;&s;ed Eter|nity, to thank you, as I now repeatedly do, for the good you have done to, and the trouble you will have taken for,</P>

<P>No wonder, while able, that &s;he was always writing, &s;ince thus only of late could &s;he employ that time which heretofore, from the long days &s;he made, cau&s;ed &s;o many beautiful works to &s;pring from her fingers. It is my opi|nion, that there never was a lady &s;o young, who wrote &s;o much, and with &s;uch celerity. Her thoughts keeping pace, as I have &s;een, with her pen, &s;he hardly ever &s;topp'd or he&s;itated; and very &s;eldom blotted out, or altered. It was a natural talent &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of, among many other extraordinary ones.</P>
<P>I gave the Colonel his letter, and ordered Harry in|&s;tantly to get ready to carry the others.</P>
<P>Mean time (retiring into the next apartment) we opened the Will.

<P>POOR Mrs. Norton is come. She was &s;et down at the door; and would have gone up &s;tairs directly. But Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick being together and in tears, and the former hinting too &s;uddenly to the truly ve|nerable woman the fatal news, &s;he &s;unk down at her feet, in fits; &s;o that they were forced to breathe a vein, to bring her to her&s;elf; and to a capacity of exclamation: And then &s;he run on to Mrs. Lovick and to me, who en|tered ju&s;t as &s;he recovered, in prai&s;e of the lady, in la|mentations for her, and invectives again&s;t you: But yet &s;o circum&s;cribed were her invectives, that I could ob&s;erve in them the woman well-educated, and in her lamenta|tions the pa&s;&s;ion chri&s;tianized, as I may &s;ay.</P>
<P>She was impatient to &s;ee the corp&s;e. The women went up with her. But they owned, that they were too much affected them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe her ex|tremely affecting behaviour.</P>
<P>With trembling impatience &s;he pu&s;hed a&s;ide the coffin|lid. She bathed the face with her tears, and ki&s;&s;ed her cheeks and forehead, as if &s;he were living. It was <HI>Her</HI> indeed, &s;he &s;aid! Her &s;weet young lady! Her very &s;elf! Nor had death, which changed all things, a power to alter her lovely features! She admired the &s;erenity of her a&s;pect. She no doubt was happy, &s;he &s;aid, as &s;he had written to her &s;he &s;hould be: But how many mi&s;erable creatures had &s;he left behind her!&mdash;The good woman lamenting that &s;he her&s;elf had lived to be one of them.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">It was with difficulty they prevailed upon her to quit the corp&s;e; and when they went into the next apartment, I joined them, and acquainted her with the kind legacy her beloved young lady had left her: But This rather augmented, than dimini&s;hed her concern. She ought, &s;he &s;aid, to have attended her in per&s;on. What was the world to her, wringing her hands, now the child of her bo&s;om and of her heart was no more? Her principal con&s;o|lation, however, was, that &s;he &s;hould not long &s;urvive her. She hoped, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he did not &s;in, in wi&s;hing &s;he might not.</P>
<P>It was ea&s;y to ob&s;erve by the &s;imilitude of &s;entiments &s;hewn in This and other particulars, that the divine lady owed to this excellent woman many of her good notions.</P>
<P>I thought it would divert the poor gentlewoman, and not altogether un&s;uitably, if I were to put her upon furni&s;hing mourning for her&s;elf; as it would rou&s;e her, by a &s;ea|&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary employment from that di&s;mal le|thargy of grief, which generally &s;ucceeds the too violent angui&s;h with which a gentle nature is accu&s;tomed to be torn upon the fir&s;t communication of the unexpected lo&s;s of a dear friend. I gave her therefore the thirty guineas bequeathed to her and to her &s;on for mourning; the only mourning which the fair te&s;tatrix has mentioned: And de&s;ired her to lo&s;e no time in preparing her own, as I doubted not, that &s;he would accompany the corp&s;e, if it were permitted to be carried down.</P>
<P>The Colonel propo&s;es to attend the her&s;e, if his kindred give him not fre&s;h cau&s;e of di&s;plea&s;ure; and will take with him a copy of the Will. And being intent to give the fa|mily &s;ome favourable impre&s;&s;ions of me, he will al&s;o, at his own de&s;ire, take with him the copy of the po&s;thumous letter to me.</P>
<P>He is &s;o kind as to promi&s;e me a minute account of all that &s;hall pa&s;s on the melancholy occa&s;ion. And we have begun a friend&s;hip and &s;ettled a corre&s;pondence, which but one incident can po&s;&s;ibly happen to interrupt to the end of our lives. And that I hope will not happen.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t be the grief, the remor&s;e, that will &s;eize upon the hearts of this hitherto inexorable family, on the
<PB N="232" REF="233">
receiving of the po&s;thumous letters, and that of the Co|lonel apprizing them of what has happened!</P>
<P>I have given orders to an undertaker, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition that the body will be permitted to be carried down; and the women intend to fill the coffin with aromatic herbs.</P>
<P>The Colonel has obliged me to take the bills and draughts which he brought up with him, for the con&s;iderable &s;ums accrued &s;ince the grandfather's death from the lady's e&s;tate.</P>
<P>I could have &s;hewn to Mrs. Norton the copies of the two letters which &s;he mi&s;&s;ed by coming up. But her grief wants not the heightenings which the reading of them would have given her.</P>
<P>I HAVE been dipping into the copies of the po&s;thumous letters to the family, which Harry has carried down. Well may I call this admirable Lady divine. They are all calculated to give comfort rather than reproach, tho' their cruelty to her merited nothing but reproach. But were I in any of their places, how much rather had I, that &s;he had quitted &s;cores with me by the mo&s;t &s;evere re|criminations, than that &s;he &s;hould thus nobly triumph over me by a genero&s;ity that has no example?</P>
<P>I will inclo&s;e &s;ome of them, which I de&s;ire you to re|turn as &s;oon as you can.</P>

<P>And now let me ble&s;s you, my honoured papa, and ble&s;s you, as I write, upon my knees, for all the benefits I have received from your indulgence: For your fond love to me in the days of my prattling innocence: For the virtuous education you gave me: And, for the crown

<P>Still on her knees, let your poor penitent implore your forgivene&s;s of all her faults and follies; more e&s;pecially of that fatal error which threw her out of your protection.</P>
<P>When you know, Sir, that I have never been faulty in my will: That ever &s;ince my calamity became irretriev|able, I have been in a &s;tate of preparation: That I have the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that the Almighty has accepted my unfeigned repentance; and that by this time you will (as I humbly pre&s;ume to hope) have been the means of adding One to the number of the Ble&s;&s;ed; you will have rea&s;on for joy rather than &s;orrow. Since, had I e&s;caped the &s;nares by which I was intangled, I might have wanted tho&s;e exerci&s;es which I look upon now as &s;o many mercies di&s;pen&s;ed to wean me betimes from a world that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to me with pro&s;pects too alluring: And, in that ca&s;e (too ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with <HI>worldly</HI> felicity) I might not have attained to that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, which now, on your reading of This, I humbly pre&s;ume (thro' the Di|vine goodne&s;s) I am rejoicing in.</P>
<P>That the Almighty, in His own good time, will bring you, Sir, and my ever-honoured mother, after a &s;eries of earthly felicities, of which may my unhappy fault be the only interruption, (and very grievous I know that mu&s;t have been) to rejoice in the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, is the re|peated prayer of, Sir,</P>

<P>Every vein of my heart has bled for an unhappy ra&s;h|ne&s;s; which (altho' involuntary as to the act) from the moment it was committed, carried with it its own puni&s;h|ment; and was accompanied with a true and &s;incere pe|nitence.</P>
<P>God, who has been a witne&s;s of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, knows, that great as they have been, the greate&s;t of all was the di&s;tre&s;s that I knew I mu&s;t have given to you, Madam, and to my Father, by a &s;tep that had &s;o very ugly an ap|pearance in your eyes, and his; and indeed, in all my family's: A &s;tep &s;o unworthy of <HI>your</HI> daughter, and of the education you had given her!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE was but one time, but one occa&s;ion, after the ra&s;h &s;tep I was precipitated upon, that I could hope to be excu&s;ed looking up to you in the character of a brother and a friend. And NOW is that time, and THIS the occa&s;ion. Now, at reading This, will you pity your late unhappy &s;i&s;ter! NOW will you forgive her faults, both &s;uppo&s;ed and real. And NOW will you afford to her <HI>memory</HI> that kind concern which you refu&s;ed to her before!</P>
<P>I write, my brother, in the fir&s;t place, to beg your par|don for the offence my unhappy &s;tep gave to you and to the re&s;t of a family &s;o dear to me.</P>
<P>Virgin purity &s;hould not &s;o behave, as to be &s;u&s;pected: Yet, when you come to know all my &s;tory, you will find further room for pity, if not for <HI>more</HI> than pity, for your late unhappy &s;i&s;ter!</P>
<P>O that pa&s;&s;ion had not been deaf! That mi&s;conception would have given way to enquiry! That your rigorous heart, if it could not it&s;elf be &s;oftened (moderating the power you had obtained over every one) had permitted other hearts more indulgently to expand!</P>
<P>But I write not to give pain. I had rather you &s;hould think me faulty &s;till, than take to your&s;elf the con&s;equence that will follow from acquitting me.</P>
<P>Abandoning therefore a &s;ubject which I had not intended to touch upon (for I hope, at the writing of this, I am above the &s;pirit of recrimination) let me tell you, Sir, that my next motive for writing to you in this la&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, is, To beg of you to forego any active re&s;entments (which may endanger a life &s;o precious to all your friends) again&s;t the man to who&s;e elaborate ba&s;ene&s;s I owe my worldly ruin.</P>
<P>For, ought an innocent man to run an <HI>equal</HI> ri&s;que with a guilty one?&mdash;A <HI>more</HI> than equal ri&s;que, as the guilty one has been long inured to acts of violence, and is &s;killed in the arts of offence?</P>
<P>You would not arrogate to your&s;elf God's province,
<PB N="236" REF="237">
who has &s;aid, <HI>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it.</HI> If you would, I tremble for the con&s;equence; For will it not be &s;uitable to the Divine Ju&s;tice to puni&s;h the <HI>pre|&s;umptuous</HI> Innocent as you would be in this ca&s;e) in the <HI>very</HI> error, and that by the hand of the <HI>Self-defending</HI> Guilty&mdash;Re&s;erving <HI>him</HI> for a future day of vengeance for his accumulated crimes?</P>
<P>Leave then the poor wretch to the Divine Ju&s;tice. Let your &s;i&s;ter's fault die with her. At lea&s;t, let it not be re|vived in blood. Life is a &s;hort &s;tage where longe&s;t. A little time hence, the now green head will be gray, if it lives this little time: And if Heaven will afford him time for repentance, why &s;hould not <HI>you?</HI></P>
<P>Then think, my brother, what will be the con&s;e|quence to your dear parents, if the guilty wretch who has occa&s;ioned to them the lo&s;s of a daughter, &s;hould likewi&s;e deprive them of their be&s;t hope, an only &s;on, more worth in the family-account than &s;everal daughters?</P>
<P>Would you add, my brother, to tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which you hold your &s;i&s;ter &s;o inexcu&s;able for having (altho' from involuntary and unde&s;igned cau&s;es) given?</P>
<P>Seek not then, I be&s;eech you, to extend the evil con|&s;equences of your &s;i&s;ter's error. His con&s;cience, when it &s;hall plea&s;e God to touch it, will be &s;harper than your &s;word.</P>
<P>I have &s;till another motive for writing to you in this &s;olemn manner: It is, to intreat you to watch over your pa&s;&s;ions. The principal fault I know you to be guilty of, is, the violence of your temper when you think your&s;elf in the right: which you would oftner be, but for that very violence.</P>
<P>You have &s;everal times brought your life into danger by it.</P>
<P>Is not the man guilty of a high degree of &s;elf-partiality, who is le&s;s able to <HI>bear</HI> contradiction, than apt to <HI>give</HI> it?&mdash;How often, with you, has impetuo&s;ity brought on aba&s;e|ment?&mdash;A con&s;equence too natural.</P>
<P>Let me then caution you, dear Sir, again&s;t a warmth of temper, an impetuo&s;ity when moved, and you &s;o <HI>ready</HI> to be moved, that may hurry you into unfore&s;een difficulties; and which it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure a &s;in not to endeavour to

re&s;train. God enable you to do it for the &s;ake of your own peace and &s;afety, as well pre&s;ent as future! And for the &s;ake of your family and friends, who all &s;ee your fault, but are tender of &s;peaking to you of it!</P>
<P>As for me, my brother, my puni&s;hment has been &s;ea|&s;onable. God gave me grace to make a right u&s;e of my &s;ufferings. I early repented. I never loved the man half &s;o m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch as I hated his actions, when I &s;aw what he was capable of. I gave up my whole <HI>heart</HI> to a better hope. God ble&s;&s;ed my penitence, and my reliance upon Him. And now I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, I AM HAPPY.</P>
<P>May Heaven pre&s;erve you in &s;afety, health, and honour, and long continue your life for a comfort and &s;tay to your honoured parents: And may you in the change of your &s;ingle &s;tate meet with a wife as agreeable to every one el&s;e as to your&s;elf, and be happy in a hopeful race, and not have one Clari&s;&s;a among them, to imbitter your com|forts when &s;he &s;hould give you <HI>mo&s;t</HI> comfort. But may my example be of u&s;e to warn the dear creatures whom once I hoped to live to &s;ee, and to cheri&s;h, of the evils with which this deceitful world abounds, are the prayers of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the&s;e lines reach your hands, your late un|happy Niece will have known the end of all her troubles; and, as &s;he humbly hopes, will be rejoicing in the mercies of a gracious God, who has declared, that He will forgive the truly penitent of heart.</P>
<P>I write, therefore, my dear Uncles, and to you Both in one letter (&s;ince your fraternal love has made you Both but as One per&s;on) to give you comfort, and not di&s;tre&s;s; for, however &s;harp my afflictions have been, they have been but of &s;hort duration; and I am betimes (happily as I hope) arrived at the end of a painful journey.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I write to thank you both, for all your kind indulgence to me, and to beg your forgivene&s;s of my la&s;t my <HI>only</HI> great fault to you and to my family.</P>
<P>The ways of Providence are un&s;earchable. Various are the means made u&s;e of by It, to bring poor &s;inners to a &s;en&s;e of their duty. Some are drawn by Love; others are driven by Terrors, to their Divine Refuge. I had for Eighteen years out of Nineteen rejoiced in the favour and affection
<PB N="239" REF="240">
of every one. No trouble came near my heart. I &s;eemed to be one of tho&s;e de&s;igned to be drawn by the &s;ilken cords of Love.&mdash;But, perhaps, I was too apt to value my&s;elf upon the love and favour of every one: The merit of the good I delighted to do, and of the inclinations which were given me, and which I could not help having, I was, perhaps, too ready to attribute to my&s;elf; and now, being led to account for the cau&s;e of my temporary calamities, find, I had a &s;ecret pride to be puni&s;hed for, which I had not fa|thomed: And it was nece&s;&s;ary perhaps that &s;ome &s;ore and terrible misfortunes &s;hould befal me, in order to mor|tify my pride and my vanity.</P>
<P>Temptations were accordingly &s;ent. I &s;hrunk in the day of tryal. My di&s;cretion, which had been &s;o cry'd up, was found wanting when it came to be weighed in an equal balance. I was betrayed, fell, and became the by-word of my companions, and a di&s;grace to my family, which had prided it&s;elf in me perhaps too much. But as my fault was not that of a culpable will, when my pride was &s;ufficiently mortified (altho' I was &s;urrounded by dan|gers, and intangled in &s;nares) I was not &s;uffered to be to|tally lo&s;t: But, purified by &s;ufferings, I was fitted for the change I have NOW, at the time you will receive This, &s;o newly, and, as I humbly hope, &s;o happily experienced.</P>
<P>Rejoice with me then, dear Sirs, that I have weathered &s;o great a &s;torm. Nor let it be matter of concern, that I am cut off in the bloom of youth.

<P>Once more, dear Sirs, accept my grateful thanks for all your goodne&s;s to me, from my early childhood, to the day, the unhappy day, of my error! Forgive that error!&mdash;And God give us a happy meeting in a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity, prays,</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Belford gives the Lady's po&s;thumous letters to Mrs. Hervey, Mi&s;s Howe, and Mrs. Norton, at length like|wi&s;e: But, altho' every letter varies in &s;tyle as well</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="241">
<HI>as matter from the others; yet, as they are written on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and are pretty long, it is thought proper to ab&s;tract them.</HI></P>
<P>That to her Aunt Hervey is written in the &s;ame pious and generous &s;train with the others preceding, &s;eeking to give comfort rather than di&s;tre&s;s.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The Almighty, I hope, &s;ays &s;he, has received and ble&s;&s;ed my penitence, and I am happy. Could I have been more than &s;o, at the end of what is called a happy life of 20, or 30, or 40 years to come? And what are 20, or 30, or 40 years to look back upon, when pa&s;&s;ed?&mdash;In half of either of the&s;e pe|riods, what friends might I not have mourned for? what temptations from worldly pro&s;perity might I not have encountered with? And in &s;uch a ca&s;e, immer&s;ed in earthly plea&s;ures, how little likelihood, that, in my la&s;t &s;tage, I &s;hould have been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a preparation and re&s;ignation, as I have now been ble&s;&s;ed with?'</Q></P>
<P>She proceeds as follows:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Thus much, Madam, of comfort to you and my&s;elf from this di&s;pen&s;ation. As to my dear parents, I hope they will con&s;ole them&s;elves, that they have &s;till many ble&s;&s;ings left, which ought to balance the troubles my error has given them: That, unhappy as I have been to be the interrupter of their felicities, they never, till this my fault, knew any <HI>heavy evil;</HI> That afflictions patiently borne may be turned into ble&s;&s;ings: That uninterrupted happine&s;s is not to be ex|pected in this life: That, after all, they have not, as I humbly pre&s;ume to hope, the probability of the ever|la&s;ting perdition of their child to deplore: And that, in &s;hort, when my &s;tory comes to be fully known, they will have the comfort to know, that my &s;ufferings will redound more to my honour than to my di&s;grace.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The&s;e con&s;iderations will, I hope, make their tem|porary lo&s;s of but <HI>one</HI> child out of <HI>three</HI> (unhappily cir|cum&s;tanced too as &s;he was) matter of greater con&s;ola|tion than affliction. And the rather, as we may hope for a happy meeting once more, never to be &s;eparated either by time or offences.'</Q></P>
<P>She concludes this letter with an addre&s;s to her cou&s;in Dolly Hervey, whom &s;he calls her amiable cou&s;in; and
<PB N="241" REF="242">
thankfully remembers for the part &s;he took in her af|flictions&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O my dear Cou&s;in, let your worthy heart be guarded again&s;t tho&s;e delu&s;ions, which have been fatal to my worldly happine&s;s!&mdash;That pity, which you be|&s;towed upon <HI>me,</HI> demon&s;trates a gentlene&s;s of nature, which may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubject you to misfortunes, if your eye be permitted to mi&s;lead your judgment.&mdash;But a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of your filial duty, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, and the precepts of &s;o prudent a mother as you have the happine&s;s to have (enforced by &s;o &s;ad an example in your own family as I have &s;et) will, I make no doubt, with the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, be your guard and &s;ecurity.'</Q></P>
<P>The po&s;thumous letter to Mi&s;s HOWE is extremely tender and affectionate. She pathetically calls upon her
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'to rejoice, that all her Clari&s;&s;a's troubles are now at an end.

The rather to rejoice, as that her misfortunes were of &s;uch a nature, that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could be tolerably happy in this life.'</Q></P>
<P>She
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'thankfully acknowleges the favours &s;he had re|ceived from Mrs. Howe and Mr. Hickman; and ex|pre&s;&s;es her concern for the trouble &s;he has occa&s;ioned to the former, as well as to her; and prays, that all the earthly ble&s;&s;ings they u&s;ed to wi&s;h to each other, may &s;ingly devolve upon <HI>her.</HI>'</Q></P>

<P>She tells her,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That her choice (a choice made with the approbation of all her friends) has fallen upon a &s;in|cere, an hone&s;t, a virtuous, and what is more than all, a <HI>pious</HI> man; a man, who altho' he admires her per&s;on, is &s;till more in love with the graces of her mind. And as tho&s;e graces are improveable with every added year of life, which will impair the tran&s;itory ones of per&s;on, what a firm ba&s;is, infers &s;he, has Mr. Hickman cho&s;en to build his love upon!'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="243">
She prays,

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To the Divine Protection, mean time, &s;he commits her; and charges her, by the love that has always &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between them, that &s;he will not mourn too heavily for her; and again calls upon her, after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gentle tear, which &s;he will allow her to let fall in memory of their uninterrupted friend&s;hip, to rejoice that &s;he is &s;o early relea&s;ed; and that &s;he is purified by her &s;ufferings, and is made, as &s;he a&s;&s;uredly tru&s;ts, by God's goodne&s;s, eter|nally happy.'</Q></P>

<P>I Under&s;tand, that thou breathe&s;t nothing but revenge again&s;t <HI>me,</HI> for treating thee with &s;o much freedom; and again&s;t the accur&s;ed woman and her infernal crew. I am not at all concerned for thy menaces again&s;t my&s;elf. It is my de&s;ign to make thee <HI>feel.</HI> It gives me plea&s;ure to find my intention an&s;wered. And I congratulate thee, that thou ha&s;t not lo&s;t that &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the cur&s;ed crew, well do they de&s;erve the fire <HI>here,</HI> that thou threatene&s;t them with, and the fire here|<HI>after</HI> that &s;eems to await them. But I have this moment received news which will, in all likelihood, &s;ave thee the guilt of puni&s;hing the old wretch for her &s;hare of wicked|ne&s;s as thy agent. But if that happens to her which is likely to happen, wilt thou not tremble for what may befal the principal?</P>
<P>Not to keep thee longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; la&s;t night, it &s;eems, the infamous woman got &s;o heartily intoxicated
<PB N="243" REF="244">
with her beloved liquor, arrack punch, at the expence of Colonel Salter, that, mi&s;taking her way, &s;he fell down a pair of &s;tairs, and broke her leg: And now, after a dread|ful night, &s;he lies foaming, raving, roaring, in a burning fever, that wants not any other fire to &s;corch her into a feeling more exqui&s;ite and durable than any thy vengeance could make her &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The wretch has reque&s;ted me to come to her: And le&s;t I &s;hould refu&s;e a common me&s;&s;enger, &s;ent her vile a&s;&s;o|ciate Sally Martin; who not finding me at Soho, came hither; another part of her bu&s;ine&s;s being to procure the divine lady's pardon for the old creature's wickedne&s;s to her.</P>
<P>This devil incarnate Sally was never &s;o &s;hocked in her life, as when I told her the lady was dead.</P>
<P>She took out her &s;alts to keep her from fainting; and when a little recovered, &s;he accu&s;ed her&s;elf for her part of the injuries the lady had &s;u&s;tained; as &s;he &s;aid Polly Horton would do for hers; and &s;hedding tears, declared, that the world never produced &s;uch another woman. She called her the ornament and glory of her Sex; acknowleged, that her r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in was owing more to their in&s;tigations than even (&s;avage as thou art) to thy own vilene&s;s: Since thou wert in|clined to have done her ju&s;tice more than once, had they not kept up thy profligate &s;pirit to its height.</P>
<P>This wretch would fain have been admitted to a &s;ight of the corp&s;e. But I refu&s;ed her reque&s;t with execrations.</P>
<P>She could forgive her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid, for every thing but her in&s;ults upon the admirable lady at Rowland's: Since all the re&s;t was but in pur&s;uit of a livelihood, to which &s;he had been reduced, as &s;he boa&s;ted, from better ex|pectations, and which hundreds follow as well as &s;he. I did not a&s;k her, <HI>By whom reduced.</HI></P>
<P>At going away, &s;he told me, that the old mon&s;ter's brui&s;es are of more dangerous con&s;equence than the frac|ture: That a mortification is apprehended: And that the vile wretch has &s;o much compunction of heart, on recol|lecting her treatment of Mi&s;s Harlowe, and is &s;o much &s;et upon procuring her forgivene&s;s, that &s;he is &s;ure the news &s;he has to carry her, will ha&s;ten her end.</P>

<P>THY &s;ervant gives me a dreadful account of thy raving unmanageablene&s;s. I wonder not at it. But as nothing violent is la&s;ting, I dare &s;ay, that thy habitual gaiety of heart will quickly get the better of thy frenzy: And the rather do I judge &s;o, as thy fits are of the raving kind (&s;uitable to thy natural impetuo&s;ity) and not of that melancholy &s;pecies which &s;eizes &s;lower &s;ouls.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on I will proceed in writing to thee, that my narrative may not be broken by thy di&s;compo&s;ure; and that the contents of it may find thee, and help thee to reflection, when thou &s;halt be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Harry is returned from carrying the po&s;thumous letters to the family and to Mi&s;s Howe; and that of the Colonel which acquaints James Harlowe with his &s;i&s;ter's death, and with her de&s;ire to be interred near her grandfather.</P>
<P>Harry was not admitted into the pre&s;ence of any of the family. They were all a&s;&s;embled together, it &s;eems, at Harlowe-place, on occa&s;ion of the Colonel's letter which informed them of the lady's dangerous way <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 210.</NOTE>; and were comforting them&s;elves, as Harry was told, with hopes, that Mr. Morden had made the wor&s;t of her &s;tate, in order to quicken their re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y then to judge what mu&s;t be their grief and &s;urpri&s;e on receiving the fatal news which the letters Harry &s;ent in to them communicated.</P>
<P>He &s;taid there long enough to find the whole hou&s;e in confu&s;ion; the &s;ervants running different ways; lamenting and wringing their hands as they run; the female &s;er|vants particularly; as if &s;ome body (poor Mrs. Harlowe no doubt; and perhaps Mrs. Hervey too) were in fits.</P>
<P>All were in &s;uch di&s;order, that he could get no com|mands, nor obtain any notice of him&s;elf. The &s;ervants &s;eemed more inclined to execrate than welcome him&mdash;O ma&s;ter! O young man! cry'd three or four together, what di&s;mal tidings have you brought!&mdash;They helped him to his hor&s;e (which with great civility they had put up on
<PB N="245" REF="246">
his arrival) at the very fir&s;t word: And he went to an inn; and pur&s;ued on foot his way to Mrs. Norton's; and finding her come to town, left the letter he carried down for her with her &s;on (a fine youth:) who, when he heard the fatal news, bur&s;t out into a flood of tears&mdash;fir&s;t lamenting the lady's death, and then crying out, What, what, would be|come of his poor mother?&mdash;How would &s;he &s;upport her|&s;elf, when &s;he &s;hould find on her arrival in town, that the dear lady who was &s;o de&s;ervedly the darling of her heart, was no more!</P>
<P>He proceeded to Mi&s;s Howe's, with the letter for her. That lady, he was told, had ju&s;t given orders for a young man, a tenant's &s;on, to po&s;t to London, to bring her news of her dear friend's condition, and whether &s;he &s;hould her&s;elf be encouraged, by an account of her being &s;till alive, to make her a vi&s;it; every thing being ordered to be in readine&s;s for her going up, on his return with the news &s;he wi&s;hed and prayed for with the utmo&s;t impa|tience. And Harry was ju&s;t in time to prevent the man's &s;etting out.</P>
<P>He had the precaution to de&s;ire to &s;peak with Mi&s;s Howe's woman or maid, and communicated to her the fatal tidings, that &s;he might break them to her young lady. The maid was her&s;elf &s;o affected, that her old lady (who, Harry &s;aid, &s;eemed to be every where at once) came to &s;ee what ailed her; and was her&s;elf &s;o &s;truck with the communication, that &s;he was forced to &s;it down in a chair; O the &s;weet creature! &s;aid &s;he&mdash;And is it come to this!&mdash;O my poor Nancy!&mdash;How &s;hall I be able to break the matter to my Nancy!</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman was in the hou&s;e. He ha&s;tened in to comfort the old lady&mdash;But he could not re&s;train his own tears. He feared, he &s;aid, when he was la&s;t in town, that this &s;ad event would &s;oon happen: But little thought it would be &s;o very &s;oon!&mdash;But &s;he is happy, I am &s;ure, &s;aid he!</P>
<P>Mrs. Howe, when a little recovered, went up, in order to break the news to her daughter. She took the letter, and her &s;alts in her hand. And Harry could perceive, that they had occa&s;ion for them. For the hou&s;ekeeper &s;oon came hurrying down into the kitchen,
<PB N="246" REF="247">
her face over&s;pread with tears&mdash;Her young mi&s;tre&s;s had fainted away, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;Nor did &s;he wonder at it&mdash;Never did there live a lady more de&s;erving of general admiration and lamentation, than Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe! And never was there a &s;tronger friend&s;hip di&s;&s;olved by death than be|tween her young lady and her. She hurried with a lighted wax-candle, and with feathers, to burn under the no&s;e of her young mi&s;tre&s;s; which &s;hewed that &s;he continued in fits.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman afterwards, with his u&s;ual humanity, di|rected that Harry &s;hould be taken care of all night; it being then the clo&s;e of day. He a&s;ked him after my health. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf exce&s;&s;ively afflicted, as well for the deprivation, as for the ju&s;t grief of the lady whom he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately loves. But he called the departed lady an Angel of Light. We dreaded, &s;aid he (tell your ma&s;ter) to read the letter &s;ent&mdash;But we needed not&mdash;'Tis a ble&s;&s;ed letter, written by a ble&s;&s;ed hand!&mdash;But the con&s;olation &s;he aims to give, will for the pre&s;ent heighten the &s;en&s;e we all &s;hall have of the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a creature! Tell Mr. Belford, that I thank God I am not the man who had the unmerited honour to call him&s;elf her brother.</P>
<P>I know how terribly this <HI>great</HI> cata&s;trophe (as I may call it, &s;ince &s;o many per&s;ons are intere&s;ted in it) affects <HI>thee.</HI> I &s;hould have been glad to have had particulars of the di&s;tre&s;s which the fir&s;t communication of it mu&s;t have given to the Harlowes. Yet who but mu&s;t pity the unhappy mother?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer which James Harlowe returned to Colonel Morden's letter of notification of his &s;i&s;ter's death, and to her reque&s;t as to interrment, will give a faint idea of what their concern mu&s;t be. Here follows a copy of it.</P>

<P>I Cannot find words to expre&s;s what we all &s;uffer on the mournfulle&s;t news that ever was communicated to us.</P>
<P>My Si&s;ter Arabella (but, alas! I have now no <HI>other</HI> Si&s;ter) was preparing to follow Mrs. Norton up; and I had re|&s;olved to e&s;corte her, and to have looked in upon the dear creature.</P>

He was actually &s;etting out with a Sur|geon of this place, to have the lady opened and embalmed.&mdash;Rot me if it be not my full per&s;ua&s;ion, that if he had, her heart would have been found to be either iron or marble.</P>
<P>We have got Lord M. to him. His Lord&s;hip is al&s;o much afflicted at the Lady's death. His &s;i&s;ters and nieces, he &s;ays, will be ready to break their hearts. What a rout's here about a woman? For after all &s;he was no more.</P>
<P>We have taken a pailful of black bull's blood from him; and this has lowered him a little. But he threatens Colonel Morden, he threatens you for your cur&s;ed reflections (Cur&s;ed reflections indeed, Jack!) and cur&s;es all the world and him&s;elf &s;till.</P>
<P>La&s;t night his mourning (which is full as deep as for a wife) was brought home, and his fellows mourning too. And tho' 8 o'clock he would put it on and make them at|tend him in theirs.</P>
<P>Every-body blames him on this Lady's account. But I &s;ee not for why. She was a <HI>vixen</HI> in her virtue. And her relations are ten times more to blame than he. I will prove this to the teeth of them all. If <HI>they</HI> could u&s;e her ill, why &s;hould they expect <HI>him</HI> to u&s;e her well?&mdash;You, or I, or Tourville, in his &s;hoes, would have done as he has done. Are not all the girls forewarned?&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Has he done by her as that Caitiffe <HI>Miles</HI> did to the farmer's daughter, whom he tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked up to town &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pretty girl al&s;o, ju&s;t &s;uch another as B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b's Ro&s;ebud!) under a notion of waiting on a lady&mdash;<HI>Drill'd</HI> her on, pretending the lady was abroad.

Kept her on (an ugly dog too!) a fortnight or three weeks; then left her to the mercy of the peo|ple of the Bagnio (never paying for any thing;) who &s;tript her of all her cloaths, and becau&s;e &s;he would not take on, threw her into pri&s;on; where &s;he died in want and in de&s;pair!'</Q>
&mdash;A true &s;tory thou knowe&s;t, Jack&mdash;This fellow de&s;erved to be damn'd. But has our Bob been &s;uch a villain as this?&mdash;And would he not have <HI>married</HI> this flinty-hearted lady?&mdash;<HI>So he is ju&s;tified very evidently.</HI></P>

<P>But he has had no re&s;t for the&s;e ten days: That's the thing!&mdash;You mu&s;t write to him; and pr'ythee coax him, Jack, and &s;end him what he writes for, and give him all his way: There will be no bearing him el&s;e. And get the lady buried as fa&s;t as you can; and don't let him know where.</P>
<P>This letter &s;hould have gone ye&s;terday. We told him it did. But were in hopes he would not have inquired after it again. But he raves as he has not any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>What he <HI>vouch&s;afed</HI> to read of other of your letters has given my Lord &s;uch a curio&s;ity, as makes him de&s;ire you to continue your accounts. Pray do: But not in your helli&s;h <HI>Araback</HI>; and we will let the poor fellow only into what we think fitting for his pre&s;ent way.</P>
<P>I live a cur&s;ed dull poking life here. With what I &s;o lately &s;aw of poor Belton, and what I now &s;ee of this charming fellow, I &s;hall be as crazy as he &s;oon, or as dull as thou, Jack; &s;o mu&s;t &s;eek for better company in town than either of you. I have been forced to read &s;ome|times to divert me; and you know I hate reading. It pre&s;ently &s;ets me into a fit of drow&s;ine&s;s, and then I yawn and &s;tretch like a devil.</P>
<P>Yet in Dryden's Palemon and Arcite have I ju&s;t now met with a pa&s;&s;age, that has in it much of our Bob's ca&s;e. The&s;e are &s;ome of the lines,</P>

<P>Let me tell you that had I begun to write as early as you and Lovelace, I might have cut as good a figure as either of you. Why not? But boy or man I ever hated a book. 'Tis a folly to lie.

Kicking and cuffing and orchard-robbing, were my early glory.</P>
<P>But I am tired of writing. I never wrote &s;uch a long letter in my life. My wri&s;ts and my fingers and thumb ake damnably. The pen is an hundred weight at the lea&s;t. And my eyes are ready to drop out of my head upon the paper.&mdash;The cramp but this minute in my fingers. Rot the goo&s;e and the goo&s;e-quill!

<SALUTE>Jack,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think it ab&s;olutely right that my ever-dear and beloved lady &s;hould be opened and embalmed. It mu&s;t be done out of hand&mdash;this very afternoon.

<P>Every thing that can be done to pre&s;erve the charmer from decay, &s;hall al&s;o be done.

<P>I will free you from your Executor&s;hip and all your cares.</P>
<P>Take notice, Belford, that I do hereby actually di&s;charge you, and every body, from all cares and troubles relating to her. And as to her la&s;t te&s;tament I will execute it my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>There were no articles between us, no &s;ettlements; and &s;he is mine, as you &s;ee I have proved to a demon&s;tration: Nor could &s;he di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf but as I plea&s;ed. D&mdash;nation &s;eize me then if I make not good my right again&s;t all op|po&s;ers!</P>

<P>I charge you &s;tir not in any part of her Will, but by my expre&s;s direction. I will order every thing my&s;elf. For am I not her hu&s;band? And being forgiven by her, am I not the cho&s;en of her heart? What el&s;e &s;ignifies her for|givene&s;s?</P>

<P>I will have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her dear heart this very night; and let Tomkins provide a proper receptacle and &s;pirits, till I can get a golden one made for it.</P>

<P>All &s;hall be &s;et forth in words at length. No mincing of the matter. Names undi&s;gui&s;ed as well as facts. For as I &s;hall make the wor&s;t figure in it my&s;elf, and have a right to treat my&s;elf as no-body el&s;e &s;hall; Who will controul me? Who dare call me to account?</P>
<P>Let me know if the damned mother be yet the &s;ubject of the devil's own vengeance&mdash;if the old wretch be dead or alive? Some exemplary mi&s;chief I mu&s;t yet do.

<P>I HAVE yours, with our unhappy friend's inclo&s;ed. I am glad my Lord is with him. As I pre&s;ume that his frenzy will be but of &s;hort continuance, I mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h that on his recovery he could be prevailed upon to go abroad. Mr. Morden, who is incon&s;olable, has &s;een by the Will, that the ca&s;e was more than a common &s;eduction; and has dropt hints already, that he looks upon him&s;elf on that account to be freed from his promi&s;es made to the dying lady, which were, that he would not &s;eek to avenge her death. You mu&s;t make the recovery of his health the motive for urging him on this head; for, if you hint at his own &s;afety, he will not &s;tir, but rather &s;eek the Colonel.</P>
<P>As to the lock of hair, you may ea&s;ily pacify him (as you once &s;aw the angel) with hair near the colour, if he be intent upon it.</P>
<P>At my Lord's de&s;ire I will write on, and in my com|mon hand; that you may judge what is, and what is not fit to read to Mr. Lovelace at pre&s;ent. But as I &s;hall not forbear reflections as I go along, in hopes to reach his heart on his recovery; I think it be&s;t to direct my&s;elf to him &s;till; and that as if he were not di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall not have lei&s;ure to take copies, and yet am willing to have the whole &s;ubject before me, for my own future contemplation, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon a return of my letters &s;ome time hence. Mr. Lovelace knows that this is one of my conditions; and has hitherto complied with it.</P>
<P>Thy letter, Mowbray, is an inimitable performance. Thou art a &s;trange impenetrable creature.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXVIII. Mr. <HI>BELFORD,</HI> To <HI>ROBERT LOVELACE,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>O Lovelace! I have a &s;cene to paint in relation to the wretched Sinclair, that, if I do it ju&s;tice, will make thee &s;eriou&s;ly ponder and reflect, or nothing can. I will lead to it in order; and that in my u&s;ual hand, that thy compeers may be able to read it as well as thy&s;elf.</P>
<P>When I had written the preceding letter; not knowing what to do with my&s;elf; recollecting, and in vain wi&s;hing for that delightful and improving conver&s;ation, which I had now for ever lo&s;t; I thought I had as good begin the ta&s;k, which I had for &s;ome time pa&s;t <HI>re&s;olved</HI> to begin; that is to &s;ay, To go to church; and &s;ee if I could not reap &s;ome benefit from what I &s;hould hear there. Ac|cordingly I determined to go to hear the celebrated preacher at St. James's church. But as if the devil (for &s;o I was then ready to conclude) thought him&s;elf concerned to pre|vent my intention, a vi&s;it was made me ju&s;t as I was dre&s;&s;ed, which took me off from my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Whom &s;hould this be from, but Sally Martin, accom|panied by Mrs. Carter, the &s;i&s;ter of the infamous Sinclair; the &s;ame, I &s;uppo&s;e I need not tell you, who keeps the Bagnio near Bloom&s;bury.</P>
<P>The&s;e told me that the &s;urgeon, apothecary, and phy|&s;ician, had all given the wretched woman over; but that &s;he &s;aid, She could not die nor be at re&s;t till &s;he &s;aw me: And they be&s;ought me to accompany them in the coach they came in, if I had one &s;park of charity, of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> charity, as they called it, left.</P>
<P>I was very loth to be diverted from my purpo&s;e by a re|que&s;t &s;o unwelcome, and from people &s;o hated; but at la&s;t went, and we got thither by ten: Where a &s;cene &s;o &s;hock|ing pre&s;ented it&s;elf to me, that the death of poor de&s;ponding Belton is not, I think, to be compared with it.</P>
<P>The old wretch had once put her leg out by her rage and violence, and had been crying, &s;colding, cur&s;ing, ever &s;ince the preceding evening, that the &s;urgeon had told her it was impo&s;&s;ible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her; and that a morti|fication had begun to &s;hew it&s;elf; in&s;omuch that purely in
<PB N="257" REF="258">
compa&s;&s;ion to their own <HI>ears,</HI> they had been forced to &s;end for another &s;urgeon, purpo&s;ely to tell her, tho' again&s;t his judgment, and (being a friend of the other) to &s;eem to convince <HI>him,</HI> that he mi&s;took her ca&s;e; and that, if &s;he would be patient, &s;he might recover. But, neverthe|le&s;s her apprehen&s;ions of death and her antipathy to the thoughts of dying were &s;o &s;trong, that their impo&s;ture had not the intended effect, and &s;he was raving, crying, cur|&s;ing, and even howling, more like a wolf than a human creature, when I came; &s;o that as I went up &s;tairs, I &s;aid, Surely this noi&s;e, this howling, cannot be from the un|happy woman! Sally &s;aid it was, and a&s;&s;ured me, that it was nothing to the noi&s;e &s;he had made all night; and &s;tepping into her room before me, Dear <HI>Madam</HI> Sinclair, &s;aid &s;he, forbear this noi&s;e! It is more like that of a bull than a woman!&mdash;Here comes Mr. Belford; and you'll fright him away, if you bellow at this rate.</P>
<P>There were no le&s;s than eight of her cur&s;ed daughters &s;urrounding her bed when I entered; one of her partners, Polly Horton, at their head; and now Sally, her other partner, and <HI>Madam</HI> Carter, as they called her (for they are all <HI>Madams</HI> with one another) made the number Ten: All in &s;hocking di&s;habille, and without &s;tays, except Sally, Carter, and Polly; who, not daring to leave her, had not been in bed all night.</P>
<P>The other &s;even &s;eemed to have been but ju&s;t up, ri&s;en perhaps from their cu&s;tomers in the fore-hou&s;e, and their nocturnal Orgies, with faces, three or four of them, that had run, the paint lying in &s;treaky &s;eams not half blowz'd off, di&s;covering coar&s;e wrinkled &s;kins: The hair of &s;ome of them of divers colours, obliged to the black-lead comb where black was affected; the artificial jet, however, yielding apace to the natural brindle: That of others plai&s;tered with oil and powder; the oil predominating: But every one's hanging about her ears and neck in broken curls, or ragged ends; and each at my entrance taken with one motion, &s;troaking their matted locks with both hands under their coifs, mobs, or pinners, every one of which was awry. They were all &s;lip-&s;hoed; &s;tockenle&s;s &s;ome; only under-petticoated all; their gowns, made to cover &s;traddling hoops, hanging trolloppy, and tangling

<P>I am the more particular in de&s;cribing to thee the ap|pearance the&s;e creatures made in my eyes when I came into the room, becau&s;e I believe thou never &s;awe&s;t any of them, much le&s;s a group of them, thus unprepared for being &s;een <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Whoever has &s;een Dean Swift's Lady's Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, will think this de&s;cription of Mr. Belford not only more natural but more decent painting, as well as better ju&s;tified by the de&s;ign, and by the u&s;e that may be made of it.</NOTE>. I, for my part, never did before; nor had I now, but upon this occa&s;ion, been thus <HI>favoured.</HI> If thou <HI>had&s;t,</HI> I believe thou would&s;t hate a profligate woman, as one of Swift's Yahoos, or Virgil's ob&s;cene Harpyes, &s;quirting their ordure upon the Trojan trenchers; &s;ince the per&s;ons of &s;uch in their retirements are as filthy as their minds&mdash;Hate them as much as I do; and as much as I admire, and next to adore a truly virtuous and elegant woman: For to me it is evident, that as a neat and clean woman mu&s;t be an angel of a creature, &s;o a &s;lutti&s;h one is the impure&s;t animal in nature.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were the veterans, the cho&s;en band; for now-and-then flitted in, to the number of half a dozen or more, by turns, &s;ubordinate &s;inners, under-graduates, younger than &s;ome of the cho&s;en phalanx, but not le&s;s ob&s;cene in their appearance, tho' indeed not &s;o much beholden to the plai&s;tering fucus; yet unpropt by &s;tays, &s;qualid, loo&s;e in attire, fluggi&s;h-haired, under-petticoated only as the for|mer, eyes half opened, winking and pinking, mi&s;patched, yawning, &s;tretching, as if from the unworn-off effects of the midnight revel; all armed in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with &s;upplies of cordials, of which every one pre&s;ent was either ta&s;ter or partaker, under the direction of the Praetorian Dorcas, who now-and-then popp'd in to &s;ee her &s;lops duly given and taken.</P>
<P>But when I approached the <HI>old wretch,</HI> what a &s;pectacle pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my eyes!</P>
<P>Her misfortune has not at all &s;unk, but rather, as I

thought, increa&s;ed her fle&s;h; rage and violence perhaps &s;welling her mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly features. Behold her then, &s;preading the whole tumbled bed with her huge quaggy carca&s;e: Her mill-po&s;t arms held up; her broad hands clenched with violence; her big eyes, goggling and flaming-red as we may &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e of a &s;alamander; her matted grie&s;ly hair, made irreverend by her wickedne&s;s (her clouted head|dre&s;s being half off) &s;pread about her fat ears and brawny neck; her livid lips parched, and working violently; her broad chin in convul&s;ive motion; her wide mouth, by rea&s;on of the contraction of her forehead (which &s;eemed to be half-lo&s;t in its own frightful furrows) &s;plitting her face, as it were, into two parts; and her huge tongue hideou&s;ly rolling in it; heaving, puffing, as if for breath, her bellows-&s;haped and various-coloured brea&s;ts a&s;cending by turns to her chin, and de&s;cending out of &s;ight, with the violence of her ga&s;pings.</P>
<P>This was the &s;pectacle, as recollection has enabled me to de&s;cribe it, that this wretch made to my eye, when I approached her bed-&s;ide, &s;urrounded, as I &s;aid, by her &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffragans and daughters, who &s;urveyed her with &s;couling frighted attention, which one might ea&s;ily &s;ee had more in it of horror, and &s;elf-concern (and <HI>&s;elf-condemnation</HI> too) than of love or pity; as who &s;hould &s;ay, See! what we our&s;elves mu&s;t one day be!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, her naturally big voice, more hoar&s;ened by her ravings, broke upon me: O Mr. Bel|ford! O Sir! &s;ee what I am come to!&mdash;See what I am brought to!&mdash;To have &s;uch a cur&s;ed crew about me, and not one of them to take care of me!&mdash;But to let me tumble down <HI>&s;tairs</HI> &s;o di&s;tant from the room I went from! &s;o di&s;tant from the room I meant to go to! O cur&s;ed be every carele&s;s devil!&mdash;May this or wor&s;e be their fate every one of them!</P>
<P>And then &s;he cur&s;ed and &s;wore more vehemently, and the more, as two or three of them were excu&s;ing them|&s;elves on the &s;core of their being at that time as unable to help them&s;elves as &s;he.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had cleared the pa&s;&s;age of her throat by the oaths and cur&s;es which her wild impatience made her utter, &s;he began in a more hollow and whining &s;train to

bemoan her&s;elf. And here, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Heaven grant me patience!

<P>What could one &s;ay to &s;uch a wretch as this! who&s;e whole life has been &s;pent in the mo&s;t diffu&s;ive wickedne&s;s, and who has more &s;ouls to an&s;wer for, of both &s;exes, than the be&s;t Divine in England ever &s;aved?&mdash;Yet I told her, She mu&s;t be patient: That her violence made her wor&s;e: And that, if &s;he would compo&s;e her&s;elf, &s;he might get into a frame more proper for her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Who I? interrupted &s;he: <HI>I</HI> get into a better frame! <HI>I,</HI> who can neither cry, nor pray! Yet already feel the torments of the damn'd! What mercy can I expect!

<P>And <HI>is</HI> &s;he dead?&mdash;Indeed dead? proceeded &s;he, when her howl was over&mdash;O what an angel have I been the means of de&s;troying!&mdash;For tho' it was that wicked man's fault that ever &s;he was in my hou&s;e, yet it was Mine, and Yours, and Yours, and Yours, Devils as we all were (turning to Sally, to Polly, and to one or two more) that he did not do her ju&s;tice! And That, <HI>That</HI> is my cur&s;e, and will one day be yours! And then again &s;he howled.</P>
<P>I &s;till advi&s;ed patience. I &s;aid, that if her time was &s;o &s;hort as &s;he apprehended it to be, the more ought &s;he to endeavour to compo&s;e her&s;elf: And then &s;he would at lea&s;t die with more ea&s;e to her&s;elf&mdash;and &s;atisfaction to her friends, I was <HI>going</HI> to &s;ay&mdash;But the word <HI>die</HI> put her into a violent raving, and thus &s;he broke in upon me.</P>

<P>By my faith, Lovelace, I trembled in every joint; and looking upon <HI>her</HI> who &s;poke This, and roared Thus, and upon the <HI>company</HI> round me, I more than once thought my&s;elf to be in one of the infernal man&s;ions!</P>
<P>Yet will I proceed and try for thy good if I can &s;hock thee but half as much with my de&s;criptions, as I was &s;hocked by what I &s;aw and heard.</P>
<P>Sally&mdash;Polly&mdash;Si&s;ter Carter! &s;aid &s;he, did you not tell me I might <HI>recover?</HI> Did not the <HI>&s;urgeon</HI> tell me I might?</P>
<P>And &s;o you <HI>may,</HI> cry'd Sally; Mr. Garon &s;ays you may, if you'll be patient. But, as I have often told you this ble&s;&s;ed morning, you are readier to take de&s;pair from your own fears, than comfort from all the hope we can give you.</P>
<P>Yet, cry'd the wretch, interrupting, does not Mr. Bel|ford (and to <HI>him</HI> you have told the truth, tho' you won't to <HI>me</HI>; Does not he) tell me I &s;hall <HI>die?</HI>&mdash;I cannot bear it! I cannot bear the <HI>thoughts</HI> of dying!&mdash;</P>
<P>And then, but that half a dozen at once endeavoured to keep down her violent hands, would &s;he have beaten her&s;elf; as it &s;eems &s;he had often attempted to do from the time the &s;urgeon popt out the word <HI>mortification</HI> to her.</P>
<P>Well, but to what purpo&s;e, &s;aid I (turning a&s;ide to her Si&s;ter, and to Sally and Polly) are the&s;e hopes given her, if the gentlemen of the faculty give her over? You &s;hould let her know the wor&s;t, and then &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ubmit; for there is no running away from death. If &s;he has any mat|ters to &s;ettle, put her upon &s;ettling them; and do not, by telling her &s;he will live when there is no room to expect it, take from her the opportunity of doing needful things. Do the &s;urgeons actually give her over?</P>
<P>They do, whi&s;pered they. Her gro&s;s habit, they &s;ay, gives no hopes. We have &s;ent for both &s;urgeons, whom we expect every minute.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">Both the &s;urgeons (who are French, for Mrs. Sinclair has heard Tourville launch out in the prai&s;e of French Surgeons) came in while we were thus talking. I retired to the further end of the room, and threw up a window for a little air, being half poi&s;oned by the effluvia ari&s;ing from &s;o many contaminated carca&s;&s;es; which gave me no imperfect idea of the &s;tench of gaols, which corrupting the ambient air, give what is called the pri&s;on-di&s;temper.</P>
<P>I came back to the bed-&s;ide, when the &s;urgeons had in|&s;pected the fracture; and a&s;ked them, If there were any expectation of her life?</P>
<P>One of them whi&s;pered me, There was none: That &s;he had a &s;trong fever upon her, which alone, in &s;uch a habit, would probably do the bu&s;ine&s;s; and that the mortification had vi&s;ibly gained upon her, &s;ince they were there &s;ix hours ago.</P>
<P>Will amputation &s;ave her? Her affairs and her mind want &s;ettling. A few days added to her life may be of &s;ervice to her in both re&s;pects.</P>
<P>They told me the fracture was high in her leg; that the knee was greatly brui&s;ed; that the mortification, in all probability, had &s;pread half-way of the <HI>Femur</HI>: And then, getting me between them (three or four of the wo|men joining us, and li&s;tening with their mouths open, and all the &s;igns of ignorant wonder in their faces, as there appeared of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency in tho&s;e of the arti&s;ts) did they by turns fill my ears with an anatomical de&s;cription of the leg and thigh, running over with terms of art; of the <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Metatar&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Tibia,</HI> the <HI>Fibula,</HI> the <HI>Patella,</HI> the <HI>Os Tali,</HI> the <HI>Os Tibiae,</HI> the <HI>Tibialis Po&s;ticus</HI> and <HI>Tibialis Anticus,</HI> up to the <HI>Os Femoris,</HI> to the <HI>Acetabulum</HI> of the <HI>Os I&s;chion,</HI> the <HI>Great Troch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nter, Glutes, Triceps, Levidus,</HI> and <HI>Little Rotators</HI>; in &s;hort, of all the mu&s;cles, cartilages, and bones, that con&s;titute the leg and thigh from the great toe to the hip; as if they would &s;hew me, that all their &s;cience had penetrated their heads no farther than their mouths; while Sally lifted up her hands with a Laud ble&s;s me! Are all Surgeons &s;o learned!&mdash;But at la&s;t both the gentlemen declared, That if &s;he and her friends would con&s;ent to amputation, they would whip off her leg in a moment.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264">Mrs. Carter a&s;ked, To what purpo&s;e, if the operation would not &s;ave her?</P>
<P>Very true, they &s;aid; but it might be a &s;atisfaction to the patient's friends, that all was done that could be done.</P>
<P>And &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e poor wretch was to be lanced and quartered, as I may &s;ay, for an experiment only! And, without any hope of benefit from the operation, was to pay the &s;ur|geons for tormenting h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r!</P>
<P>I cannot but &s;ay I have a mean opinion of both the&s;e gentlemen, who, tho' they make a figure it &s;eems in their way of living, and boa&s;t not only a French extraction, but a Paris education, never will make any in their practice.</P>
<P>How unlike my hone&s;t Engli&s;h friend Tomkins, a plain, &s;erious, intelligent man, who&s;e art lies deeper than in words; who always avoids parade and jargon: and en|deavours to make every one as much a judge of what he is about as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the time the &s;urgeons run on with their anato|mical proce&s;s, the wretched woman mo&s;t frightfully roared and bellowed; which the gentlemen (who &s;hewed them|&s;elves to be of the cla&s;s of tho&s;e who are not affected with the evils they do not <HI>feel</HI>) took no other notice of, than by rai&s;ing <HI>their</HI> voices to be <HI>heard,</HI> as &s;he rai&s;ed <HI>hers</HI>&mdash;Be|ing evidently more &s;ollicitous to increa&s;e their acquain|tance, and to propagate the notion of their &s;kill, than to attend to the clamours of the poor wretch whom they were called in to relieve; tho' by this very means, like the dog and the &s;hadow in the fable, they lo&s;t both aims with me; for I never was deceived in one rule, which I made early; to wit, <HI>That the &s;tille&s;t water is the deepe&s;t,</HI> while the bubbling &s;tream only betrays &s;hallowne&s;s; and that &s;tones and pebbles lie there &s;o near the &s;urface, to point out the be&s;t place to ford a river dry-&s;hod.</P>
<P>As no body cared to tell the unhappy wretch what every one apprehended mu&s;t follow, and what the &s;urgeons con|vinced me &s;oon would, I undertook to be the denouncer of her doom. Accordingly, the operators being with|drawn, I &s;at down by the bed-&s;ide, and &s;aid, Come, Mrs. Sinclair, let me advi&s;e you to forbear the&s;e ravings at the carel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of tho&s;e, who, I find, at the time, could take no care of them&s;elves; and &s;ince the accident <HI>has</HI> happened,

<P>She turned her head towards me, and hearing me &s;peak with a determined <HI>voice,</HI> and &s;eeing me a&s;&s;ume as deter|mined an <HI>air,</HI> became more calm and attentive.</P>
<P>I went on, telling her, that I was glad, from the hints &s;he had given, to find her concerned for her pa&s;t mi&s;-&s;pent life, and particularly for the part &s;he had had in the ruin of the mo&s;t excellent woman on earth; That if &s;he would compo&s;e her&s;elf, and patiently &s;ubmit to the con|&s;equence of an evil &s;he had brought upon her&s;elf, it might po&s;&s;ibly be happy for her yet.

<P>She &s;eemed to be in great confu&s;ion of thought, and turned her head this way and that; and at la&s;t, after much he&s;itation, &s;aid, Alas for me!

Yet could I expect none from You neither; for you had declared your&s;elf my enemy, altho' I had never done you harm: For what, Jackey, in her old tone, whining thro' her no&s;e, was Mi&s;s Har|lowe to you?&mdash;But <HI>&s;he</HI> is happy!&mdash;But oh! what will be|come of <HI>me?</HI>&mdash;Yet tell me (for the &s;urgeons have told <HI>you</HI> the truth, no doubt) tell me, Shall I do well again?

<P>I was going to re-advi&s;e her to calm her &s;pirits, and en|deavour to re&s;ign her&s;elf, and to make the be&s;t of the opportunity yet left her; but this declaration &s;et her into a mo&s;t outrageous raving.

<P>And &s;o I left them; and never was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the bene|fit of fre&s;h air, as I was the moment I entered the &s;treet.</P>

And, indeed, little do innocents think, what a total revolution of manners, what a change of fixed habits, nay, what a conque&s;t of a <HI>bad nature,</HI> is required, to make a man a good husband, a worthy fa|ther, and true friend, from <HI>principle</HI>; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that it is not in a man's own power to re|form when he will. <HI>This</HI> (to &s;ay nothing of my own expe|rience) thou ha&s;t found in the progre&s;s of thy attempts upon the divine Mi&s;s Harlowe. For who&s;e remor&s;es could be either deeper, or more frequent? and who&s;e more tran|&s;ient?</P>
<P>Don't be di&s;gu&s;ted, that I mingle &s;uch grave reflections as the&s;e with my narratives. It becomes me, in my pre&s;ent way of thinking, to do &s;o, when I &s;ee in Mi&s;s Har|lowe, how all human excellence, and in poor Belton, how all inhuman libertini&s;m, and am near &s;eeing in this abandon'd woman, how all diabolical profligatene&s;s, end. And glad &s;hould I be, for your own &s;ake, for your
<PB N="268" REF="269">
&s;plendid family's &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of all your inti|mates and acquaintance, that you were labouring under the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions, that &s;o <HI>we,</HI> who have been com|panions in (and promoters of one another's) wickedne&s;s, might join in a general atonement to the utmo&s;t of our power.</P>
<P>I came home reflecting upon all the&s;e things, more edi|fying to me than any Sermon I could have heard preached: And I &s;hall conclude this long letter with ob&s;erving, that altho' I left the wretched howler in a high phren&s;y-fit, which was exce&s;&s;ively &s;hocking to the by-&s;tanders; yet her phren&s;y is the happie&s;t part of her dreadful condition: For when &s;he is <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> as it is called, what mu&s;t be her reflections upon her pa&s;t profligate life, throughout which it has been her con&s;tant delight and bu&s;ine&s;s, devil-like, to make others as wicked as her&s;elf! What mu&s;t her terrors be (a Hell already begun in her mind!) on look|ing forward to the dreadful State &s;he is now upon the verge of!&mdash;But I drop my trembling pen.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday Night, Sept.</HI> 10.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to my promi&s;e, I &s;end you an account of matters here. Poor Mrs. Norton was &s;o very ill upon the road, that, &s;lowly as the her&s;e moved, and the chariot followed, I was afraid we &s;hould not have got her to St. Alban's. We put up there as I had intended. I was in hopes that &s;he would have been better for the &s;top: But I was forced to leave her behind me. I ordered the &s;ervant|maid you was &s;o con&s;iderately kind as to &s;end down with her, to be very careful of her; and left the chariot to
<PB N="269" REF="270">
attend her. She de&s;erves all the regard that can be paid her; not only upon my cou&s;in's account, but on her own. She is an excellent woman.</P>
<P>When we were within five miles of Harlowe-place, I put on a hand-gallop. I ordered the her&s;e to proceed more &s;lowly &s;till, the cro&s;s-road we were in being rough, and having more time before us than I wanted; for I wi&s;hed not the her&s;e to be in till near du&s;k.</P>
<P>I got to my cou&s;in's about 4 o'clock. You may believe I found a mournful hou&s;e. You de&s;ire me to be very mi|nute.</P>
<P>At my entrance into the court, they were all in motion. Every &s;ervant whom I &s;aw had &s;welled eyes, and looked with &s;o much concern, that at fir&s;t I apprehended &s;ome new di&s;a&s;ter had happened in the family.</P>
<P>Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe and Mrs. Hervey were there. They all helped on one another's grief, as they had before each other's hardne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in James met me at the entrance of the hall. His countenance expre&s;&s;ed a fixed concern; and he de|&s;ired me to excu&s;e his behaviour the la&s;t time I was there.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Arabella came to me full of tears and grief: O cou&s;in! &s;aid &s;he, hanging upon my arm, I dare not a&s;k you any que&s;tions!&mdash;About the approach of the her&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he meant.</P>
<P>I my&s;elf was full of grief; and without going farther or &s;peaking, &s;at down in the hall, in the fir&s;t chair.</P>
<P>The brother &s;at down on one hand of me, the &s;i&s;ter on the other. Both were &s;ilent. The latter in tears.</P>
<P>Mr. Antony Harlowe came to me &s;oon after. His face was over&s;pread with all the appearance of woe. He re|que&s;ted me to walk into the parlour; where, as he &s;aid, were all his fellow-mourners.</P>
<P>I attended him in. My cou&s;ins James and Arabella followed me.</P>
<P>A perfect concert of grief, as I may &s;ay, broke out the moment I entered the parlour.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Harlowe, the dear creature's Father, as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, &s;aid, O cou&s;in, cou&s;in, of all our family, you are the only one, who have nothing to reproach your|&s;elf with!&mdash;You are a happy man!</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="271">The poor Mother bowing, her head to me in &s;peechle&s;s grief, &s;at with her handkerchief held to her eyes, with one hand. The other hand was held by her &s;i&s;ter Hervey, between both hers; Mrs. Hervey weeping upon it.</P>
<P>Near the window &s;at Mr. John Harlowe. His face and his body were turned from the &s;orrowing company. His eyes were red and &s;welled.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Antony, at his re-entering the parlour, went towards Mrs. Harlowe&mdash;Don't&mdash;dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he!&mdash;Then towards my cou&s;in Harlowe&mdash;Don't&mdash;dear brother!&mdash;Don't thus give way&mdash;And without being able to &s;ay another word, went to a corner of the parlour, and, want|ing him&s;elf the comfort he would fain have given, &s;unk into a chair, and audibly &s;obbed.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Arabella followed her uncle Antony, as he walked in before me; and &s;eemed as if &s;he would have &s;poken to the pierced mother &s;ome words of comfort. But &s;he was unable to utter them, and got behind her mother's chair; and inclining her face over it on the unhappy lady's &s;houl|der, &s;eemed to claim the con&s;olation that indulgent parent u&s;ed, but then was unable to afford her.</P>
<P>Young Mr. Harlowe with all his vehemence of &s;pirit, was now &s;ubdued. His &s;elf-reproaching con&s;cience, no doubt, was the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>And what, Sir, mu&s;t their thoughts be, which at that moment, in a manner deprived them all of motion, and turned their &s;peech into &s;ighs and groans!&mdash;How to be pitied, how greatly to be pitied, all of them! But how much to be cur&s;ed that abhorred Lovelace, who, as it &s;eems, by arts uncommon, and a villainy without example, has been the &s;ole author of a woe &s;o complicated and exten&s;ive!&mdash;God judge me, as&mdash;But I &s;top&mdash;The man is your friend!&mdash;He already &s;uffers, you tell me, in his intellect&mdash;Re&s;tore him heaven to That&mdash;If I find the matter come out, as I <HI>apprehend</HI> it will&mdash;Indeed her own hints of his u&s;age of her, as in her Will, and in her fir&s;t Letter to me, are enough!&mdash;Nor think, my beloved cou&s;in, thou darling of my heart! that thy gentle &s;pirit, breathing charity and forgivene&s;s to the vile&s;t of men, &s;hall avail him!</P>
<P>But once more I &s;top&mdash;Forgive me, Sir!&mdash;Who could behold &s;uch a &s;cene, who could recollect it, in order to
<PB N="271" REF="272">
de&s;cribe it (as minutely as you wi&s;hed me to relate how this unhappy family were affected on this &s;ad occa&s;ion) every one of the mourners nearly related to him&s;elf, and not be exa&s;perated again&s;t the author of all?</P>
<P>As I was the only per&s;on (grieved as I was my&s;elf, from whom any of them, at that in&s;tant, could derive comfort; Let us not, &s;aid I, my dear cou&s;in, approaching the in|con&s;olable Mother, give way to a grief, which however ju&s;t, can now avail us nothing. We hurt our&s;elves, and can|not recall the dear creature for whom we mourn. Nor would you wi&s;h it, if you knew with what a&s;&s;urances of eternal happine&s;s &s;he left the world.&mdash;She is happy, Madam!&mdash;Depend upon it, &s;he is happy! And comfort your&s;elves with that a&s;&s;urance.</P>
<P>O cou&s;in, cou&s;in! cried the unhappy mother, with|drawing her hand from her &s;i&s;ter Hervey, and pre&s;&s;ing mine with it, You know not what a child I have lo&s;t!&mdash;Then in a lower voice, And <HI>how</HI> lo&s;t!&mdash;That it is that makes the lo&s;s in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>They all joined in a kind of melancholy chorus, and each accu&s;ed him and her&s;elf, and &s;ome of them one an|other. But the eyes of all in turn, were ca&s;t upon my cou&s;in James as the per&s;on who had kept up the general re&s;entment again&s;t &s;o &s;weet a creature. While he was hardly able to bear his own remor&s;e: Nor Mi&s;s Harlowe hers; She breaking out into words, How tauntingly did I write to her! How barbarou&s;ly did I in&s;ult her! Yet how patiently did &s;he take it!&mdash;Who would have thought &s;he had been &s;o near her end!&mdash;O brother, brother!&mdash;but for <HI>you!</HI>&mdash;But for <HI>you!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Double not upon me, &s;aid he, my own woes!&mdash;I have every thing before me that has pa&s;&s;ed!&mdash;I thought only to reclaim a dear creature that had erred! I intended not to break her tender heart!&mdash;But it was the villainous Love|lace who did that&mdash;Not any of us!&mdash;Yet, cou&s;in, did &s;he not attribute all to <HI>me?</HI>&mdash;I fear &s;he did!&mdash;Tell me only, did &s;he name <HI>me,</HI> did &s;he <HI>&s;peak</HI> of me, in her la&s;t hours? I hope &s;he, who could forgive the greate&s;t villain on earth, and plead that he may be &s;afe from our vengeance; I <HI>hope</HI> &s;he could forgive <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="273">She died ble&s;&s;ing you all; and ju&s;tified rather than con|demned your &s;everity to her.</P>
<P>Then they &s;et up another general lamentation. We &s;ee, &s;aid her father; Enough we &s;ee, in her heart-piercing letters to us, what a happy frame &s;he was in a few days before her death: But did it hold to the la&s;t? Had &s;he no repinings? Had the dear child no heart-burnings?</P>
<P>None at all!&mdash;I never &s;aw, and never &s;hall &s;ee, &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a <HI>departure</HI>: And no wonder, for I never heard of &s;uch a <HI>preparation.</HI> Every hour for weeks together was taken up in it. Let this be our comfort&mdash;We need only to wi&s;h for &s;o happy an end for our&s;elves and for tho&s;e who are neare&s;t to our hearts. We may any of us be grieved, for acts of unkindne&s;s to her: But had all happened that once &s;he wi&s;hed for, &s;he could not have made a happier, per|haps not &s;o happy, an end.</P>
<P>Dear &s;oul! and dear &s;weet &s;oul! the Father, Uncles, Si&s;ter, my cou&s;in Hervey cried out all at once in accents of angui&s;h inexpre&s;&s;ibly affecting.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t for ever be di&s;turbed for tho&s;e acts of unkind|ne&s;s to &s;o &s;weet a child, cried the unhappy Mother!&mdash;Indeed, indeed (&s;oftly to her Si&s;ter Hervey) I have been too pa&s;&s;ive, much too pa&s;&s;ive, in this ca&s;e!&mdash;The tem|porary quiet I have been &s;o &s;tudious all my life to pre|&s;erve, has co&s;t me everla&s;ting di&s;quiet!&mdash;</P>
<P>There &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Si&s;ter!</HI> was all Mrs. Hervey could &s;ay.</P>
<P>I have done but half my duty to the deare&s;t and mo&s;t meritorious of children, re&s;umed the &s;orrowing mother!&mdash;Nay, <HI>not</HI> half!&mdash;How have we hardened our hearts again&s;t her!&mdash;</P>
<P>Again her tears choaked up the pa&s;&s;age of her words.</P>
<P>My <HI>deare&s;t, deare&s;t Si&s;ter!</HI> again was all Mrs. Hervey could &s;ay.</P>
<P>Would to Heaven, proceeded, exclaiming, the poor mother, I had but <HI>once</HI> &s;een her! Then turning to my Cou&s;in James and his Si&s;ter&mdash;O my Son! O my Arabella! if WE were to receive as little mercy&mdash;</P>
<P>And there again &s;he &s;topt, her tears interrupting her further &s;peech: Every one, all the time, remaining &s;ilent;
<PB N="273" REF="274">
their countenances &s;hewing a grief in their hearts too big for expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now you &s;ee, Mr. Belford, that my deare&s;t cou&s;in could be allowed all her merit!&mdash;What a dreadful thing is after-reflection upon a conduct &s;o perver&s;e and unna|tural?</P>
<P>O this cur&s;ed friend of yours, Mr. Belford! This de|te&s;ted Lovelace!&mdash;To him, To him is owing&mdash;</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir. I will lay down my pen till I have re|covered my temper.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>One in the Morning.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN vain, Sir, have I endeavoured to compo&s;e my&s;elf to re&s;t. You wi&s;hed me to be very particular, and I cannot help it. This melancholy &s;ubject fills my whole mind. I will proceed, tho' it be midnight.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o'clock the her&s;e came to the outward gate. The Pari&s;h-church is at &s;ome di&s;tance; but the wind &s;itting fair, the afflicted family were &s;truck, ju&s;t before it came, in|to a fre&s;h fit of grief, on hearing the funeral bell tolled in a very &s;olemn manner. A re&s;pect as it proved, and as they all gue&s;&s;ed, paid to the memory of the dear decea&s;ed out of officious love, as the her&s;e pa&s;&s;ed near the church.</P>
<P>Judge, when their grief was &s;o great in expectation of it, what it mu&s;t be when it arrived.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant came in to acquaint us with what its lum|bering heavy noi&s;e up the paved inner court-yard ap|prized us of before.</P>
<P>He &s;poke not. He could not &s;peak. He looked, bowed, and withdrew.</P>
<P>I &s;tept out. No one el&s;e could then &s;tir. Her brother, however, &s;oon followed me.</P>
<P>When I came to the door, I beheld a &s;ight very af|fecting.</P>
<P>You have heard, Sir, how univer&s;ally my dear cou&s;in was beloved. By the poor and middling &s;ort e&s;pecially, no young lady was ever &s;o much beloved. And with rea&s;on: She was the common patrone&s;s of all the hone&s;t poor in her neighbourhood.</P>
<P>It is natural for us in every deep and &s;incere grief to in|tere&s;t all we know in what is &s;o concerning to our&s;elves. The &s;ervants of the family, it &s;eems, had told <HI>their</HI> friends,
<PB N="274" REF="275">
and tho&s;e <HI>theirs,</HI> that, tho' living, their dear young lady could not be received nor looked upon, her body was permitted to be brought home. The &s;pace of time was &s;o confined, that tho&s;e who knew when &s;he died, mu&s;t ea&s;ily gue&s;s near the time the her&s;e was to come. A her&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing thro' country villages, and from London, however &s;lenderly attended (for the chariot, as I have &s;aid, waited upon poor Mrs. Norton) takes every one's attention. Nor was it hard to gue&s;s who&s;e <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t be, tho' not adorned by e&s;cutcheons, when the cro&s;s-roads to Harlowe-place were taken, as &s;oon as it came within &s;ix miles of it: &s;o that the Her&s;e, and the &s;olemn Tolling of the Bell, had drawn to|gether at lea&s;t fifty of the neighbouring men, women, and children, and &s;ome of good appearance. Not a &s;oul of them, it &s;eems, with a dry eye; and each lamenting the death of this admired lady, who, as I am told, never &s;tirred out, but &s;omebody was the better for her.</P>
<P>The&s;e, when the coffin was taken out of the her&s;e, crouding about it, hindered, for a few moments, its being carried in; the young people &s;truggling who &s;hould bear it; and yet with re&s;pectful <HI>whi&s;perings,</HI> rather than cla|morous <HI>contention.</HI> A mark of veneration I had never be|fore &s;een paid, upon any occa&s;ion, in all my travels, from the under-bred Many, from whom noi&s;e is generally in|&s;eparable in all their emulations. At la&s;t &s;ix maidens were permitted to carry it in by the &s;ix handles.</P>
<P>The corp&s;e was thus borne, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn re|&s;pect, into the hall, and placed for the pre&s;ent upon two &s;tools there. The plates, and emblems, and in&s;cription, &s;et every one gazing upon the Lid, and admiring. The more, when they were told, that all was of her own ordering. They wi&s;hed to be permitted a &s;ight of the corp&s;e; but rather mentioned this as their wi&s;h than their hope. When they had all &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity, and remarked upon the emblems, they di&s;per&s;ed, with ble&s;&s;ings upon her me|mory, and with tears and lamentations; pronouncing her to be happy; and inferring, that were <HI>She</HI> not &s;o, what would become of Them? While others ran over with re|petitions of the good &s;he delighted to do. Nor were there wanting tho&s;e among them, who heaped cur&s;es upon the man who was the author of her fall.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="276">The &s;ervants of the family then got about the coffin. They could not before. And that afforded a new &s;cene of &s;orrow: But a &s;ilent one; for they &s;poke only by their eyes, and by &s;ighs, looking upon the lid, and upon one another, by turns, with hands lifted up. The pre&s;ence of their young ma&s;ter po&s;&s;ibly might awe them, and cau&s;e their grief to be expre&s;&s;ed only in dumb &s;hew.</P>
<P>As for Mr. James Harlowe (who had accompanied me, but withdrew when he &s;aw the croud) he &s;tood looking upon the lid when the people had left it, with a fixed attention: Yet, I dare &s;ay, knew not a &s;ymbol or letter upon it at that moment, had the que&s;tion been a&s;ked him. In a profound reverie he &s;tood, his arms folded, his head on one &s;ide, and marks of &s;tupefaction imprinted upon every feature.</P>
<P>But when the corp&s;e was carried into the le&s;&s;er parlour, adjoining to the hall, which &s;he u&s;ed to call <HI>her</HI> parlour, and put on a table in the middle of the room, and the Father and Mother, the two Uncles, her Aunt Hervey, and her Si&s;ter came in (joining her Brother and me, with trembling feet, and eager woe) the &s;cene was &s;till more affecting. Their &s;orrow was heightened, no doubt, by the remembrance of their unforgiving &s;everity: And now &s;eeing before them the receptacle that contained the glory of their family, who &s;o lately was driven thence by their indi&s;creet violence (never, never more to be re&s;tored to them!) no wonder that their grief was more than common grief.</P>
<P>They would have with-held the Mother, it &s;eems, from coming in: But when they could not, tho' undetermined before, they all bore her company, led on by an impul&s;e they could not re&s;i&s;t. The poor lady but ju&s;t ca&s;t her eye upon the coffin, and then &s;natched it away, retiring with pa&s;&s;ionate grief towards the window; yet addre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf, with cla&s;ped hands, as if to her beloved daughter; O my child! my child! cried &s;he; thou pride of my hope! Why was I not permitted to &s;peak pardon and peace to thee!&mdash;O forgive thy cruel mother!</P>
<P>Her Son (his heart then &s;oftened, as his eyes &s;hewed) be&s;ought her to withdraw: And her woman looking in at that moment, he called her to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in conducting
<PB N="276" REF="277">
her lady into the middle parlour: And then returning, met his Father going out at the door, who al&s;o had but ju&s;t ca&s;t his eye on the coffin, and yielded to my entreaties to withdraw.</P>
<P>His grief was too deep for utterance, till he &s;aw his &s;on coming in; and then, fetching a heavy groan, Never, &s;aid he, was &s;orrow like my &s;orrow!&mdash;O Son! Son!&mdash;in a reproaching accent, his face turned from him.</P>
<P>I attended him thro' the middle parlour, endeavouring to con&s;ole him. His Lady was there in agonies. She took his eye. He made a motion towards her: O my dear, &s;aid he&mdash;But turning &s;hort, his eyes as full as his heart, he ha&s;tened thro' to the great parlour: And when there, he de&s;ired me to leave him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Her uncles and her &s;i&s;ter looked and turned away, looked and turned away, very often upon the emblems, in &s;ilent &s;orrow. Mrs. Hervey would have read to them the in|&s;cription&mdash;The&s;e words &s;he did read, <HI>Here the wicked cea&s;e from troubling:</HI> But could read no further. Her tears fell in large drops upon the plate &s;he was contemplating, and yet &s;he was de&s;irous of gratifying a curio&s;ity that mingled impatience with her grief becau&s;e &s;he could <HI>not</HI> gratify it, altho' &s;he often wiped her eyes as they flowed.</P>
<P>Judge you, Mr. Belford (for you have great humanity) how <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t be affected. Yet was I forced to try to com|fort them All.</P>
<P>But here I will clo&s;e this letter, in order to &s;end it to you in the morning early. Neverthele&s;s, I will begin an|other, upon &s;uppo&s;ition that my doleful prolixity will not be di&s;agreeable to you. Indeed I am altogether indi&s;po&s;ed for Re&s;t, as I mentioned before. So can do nothing but write. I have al&s;o more melancholy &s;cenes to paint. My pen, if I may &s;o &s;ay, is untired. The&s;e &s;cenes are fre&s;h in my memory: And I my&s;elf, perhaps, may owe to you the favour of a reviewal of them, with &s;uch other papers as you &s;hall think proper to oblige me with, when heavy grief has given way to milder melancholy.</P>
<P>My &s;ervant, in his way to you with this letter, &s;hall call at St. Alban's upon the good woman, that he may inform you how &s;he does. Mi&s;s Arabella a&s;ked me after her, when I withdrew to my chamber; to which &s;he com|plai&s;antly

<P>No wonder that the dear departed, who fore&s;aw the remor&s;e that would fall to the lot of this unhappy family when they came to have the news of her death confirmed to them, was &s;o grieved for their apprehended grief, and endeavoured to comfort them by her po&s;thumous letters.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXX. Colonel <HI>MORDEN.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the unhappy mourners were all retired, I directed the lid of the coffin to be un&s;crewed, and cau&s;ed &s;ome fre&s;h aromatics and flowers to be put into it.</P>
<P>The corp&s;e was very little altered, notwith&s;tanding the journey. The &s;weet &s;mile remained.</P>
<P>The maids who brought the flowers were ambitious of &s;trewing them about it: They poured forth fre&s;h lamen|tations over her; each wi&s;hing &s;he had been &s;o happy as to have been allowed to attend her in London. One of them particularly, who is, it &s;eems, my cou&s;in Arabella's per&s;onal &s;ervant, was more clamorous in her grief than the re&s;t; and the moment &s;he turned her back, all the others allowed &s;he had rea&s;on for it. I enquired after|wards about her, and found, that this creature was &s;et over my dear cou&s;in, when &s;he was confined to her chamber by their indi&s;creet &s;everity.</P>
<P>Good heaven! that they &s;hould treat, and &s;uffer thus to be treated, a young lady, who was qualified to give laws to all her family!</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="279">When my cou&s;ins were told, that the lid was un&s;crew'd, they pre&s;s'd in again, all but the mournful Father and Mother, as if by con&s;ent. Mrs. Hervey ki&s;&s;ed her pale lips. Flower of the world! was all &s;he could &s;ay; and gave place to Mi&s;s Arabella; who ki&s;&s;ing the forehead of <HI>her</HI> whom &s;he had &s;o cruelly treated, could only &s;ay, to my cou&s;in James (looking upon the corp&s;e, and upon him) O Brother!&mdash;While he, taking the fair lifele&s;s hand, ki&s;&s;ed it, and retreated with precipitation.</P>
<P>Her two Uncles were &s;peechle&s;s. They &s;eemed to wait each other's example, whether to look upon the corp&s;e, or not. I ordered the lid to be replaced; and then they pre&s;&s;ed forward, as the others again did, to take a la&s;t farewel of the ca&s;ket which &s;o lately contained &s;o rich a jewel.</P>
<P>Then it was that the grief of each found fluenter ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and the fair corp&s;e was addre&s;&s;ed to with all the tenderne&s;s that the &s;incere&s;t love and warme&s;t admi|ration could in&s;pire) by each, according to their different degrees of relation&s;hip, as if none of them had before looked upon her. She was their very Niece, both uncles &s;aid; The injured Saint, her uncle Harlowe; The &s;ame &s;miling Si&s;ter, Arabella!&mdash;The dear creature! all of them&mdash;The &s;ame benignity of countenance! The &s;ame &s;weet compo&s;ure! The &s;ame natural dignity&mdash;<HI>She</HI> was que&s;tionle&s;s happy! That &s;weet &s;mile betokened <HI>her</HI> being &s;o; <HI>Them&s;elves</HI> mo&s;t unhappy!&mdash;And then, once more, the Brother took the lifele&s;s hand, and vowed Revenge upon it, on the cur&s;ed author of all this di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The unhappy parents propo&s;ed to take one la&s;t view and farewel of their once darling daughter. The Father was got to the parlour-door, after the incon&s;olable Mo|ther: But neither of them were able to enter it. The Mother &s;aid, he mu&s;t once more &s;ee the child of her heart, or &s;he &s;hould never enjoy her&s;elf. But they both agreed to refer their melancholy curio&s;ity till the next day; and hand in hand retired incon&s;olable, and &s;peechle&s;s both, their faces over&s;pread with woe, and turned from each other, as unable each to behold the di&s;tre&s;s of the other.</P>
<P>When all were withdrawn, I retired, and &s;ent for my cou&s;in James, and acquainted him with his &s;i&s;ter's reque&s;t
<PB N="279" REF="280">
in relation to the di&s;cour&s;e to be pronounced at her interr|ment; telling him, how nece&s;&s;ary it was, that the Mi|ni&s;ter, whoever he were to be, &s;hould have the earlie&s;t no|tice given him that the ca&s;e would admit.</P>
<P>He lamented the death of the reverend Dr. Lewen, who, as he &s;aid, was a great admirer of his &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he was of him, and would have been the fitte&s;t of all men for that office.</P>
<P>He &s;poke with great a&s;perity of Mr. Brand, upon who&s;e light enquiry after his &s;i&s;ter's character in town, he was willing to lay &s;ome of the blame due to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Melvill, Dr. Lewen's a&s;&s;i&s;tant, mu&s;t, he &s;aid, be the man; and he prai&s;ed him for his abilities, his elocution, and unexceptionable manners; and promi&s;ed to engage him early in the morning.</P>
<P>He called out his Si&s;ter, and &s;he was of his opinion. So I left this upon them.</P>
<P>They both, with no little warmth, hinted their di&s;ap|probation of you, Sir, for their &s;i&s;ter's Executor, on the &s;core of your intimate friend&s;hip with the author of her ruin.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not re&s;ent any thing I &s;hall communicate to you of what they &s;ay on this occa&s;ion. Depending that you will not, I &s;hall write with the greater freedom.</P>
<P>I told them how much my dear cou&s;in was obliged to your friend&s;hip and humanity: The injunctions &s;he had laid you under, and your own inclination to ob&s;erve them. I &s;aid, That you were a man of honour: That you were de&s;irous of con&s;ulting me, becau&s;e you would not willingly give offence to any of them; and that I was very fond of cultivating your favour and corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, There was no need of an Executor out of their family, and they hoped that you, Sir, would relin|qui&s;h &s;o <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary</HI> a tru&s;t, as they called it. My cou&s;in James declared, that he would write to you as &s;oon as the funeral was over, to de&s;ire that you would do &s;o, upon proper a&s;&s;urances that all that the Will pre&s;cribed &s;hould be performed.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, You were a man of re&s;olution: That I thought he would hardly &s;ucceed; for that you made a point of honour of it.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="281">I then &s;hewed them their Si&s;ter's po&s;thumous Letter to you; in which &s;he confe&s;&s;es her obligations to you, and regard for you, and for your future welfare <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See page 226.</NOTE>. You may believe, Sir, they were extremely affected with the peru|&s;al of it.</P>
<P>They were &s;urprized, that I had given up to you the proceed of her grandfather's e&s;tate, &s;ince his death. I told them plainly, that they mu&s;t thank them&s;elves if any thing di&s;agreeable to them occurred from their &s;i&s;ter's de|vi&s;e; de&s;erted and thrown into the hands of &s;trangers, as &s;he had been.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, they would report all I had &s;aid to their father and mother; adding, That great as their trouble was, they found they had more &s;till to come. But if Mr. Belford <HI>were to be</HI> the Executor of her Will, contrary to their hopes, they be&s;ought me to take the trouble of tran&s;acting every thing with you; that a friend of the man, to whom they owed all their calamity, might not appear to them.</P>
<P>They were extremely moved at the text their &s;i&s;ter had cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of the funeral di&s;cour&s;e <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See the Will, page 309.</NOTE>.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are &s;uch bad company here to one another, that it is &s;ome relief to retire, and write.</P>
<P>I was &s;ummoned to breakfa&s;t about half an hour after nine. Slowly did the mournful congre&s;s meet. Each, liftle&s;s and &s;piritle&s;s, took our place, with &s;wollen eyes inquiring, without expecting any tolerable account, how each had re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;orrowing Mother gave for an&s;wer, That &s;he &s;hould never more know what Re&s;t was.</P>
<P>By the time we were well &s;eated, the bell ringing, the outward gate opening, a chariot rattling over the pave|ment of the court-yard, put them into emotion.</P>
<P>I left them; and was ju&s;t time enough to give Mi&s;s Howe my hand, as &s;he alighted: Her maid in tears remaining in the chariot.</P>
<P>I think you told me, Sir, you never &s;aw Mi&s;s Howe. She is a fine graceful young lady. A fixed melancholy on her whole a&s;pect, overclouded a vivacity and fire, which, neverthele&s;s, darted now-and-then through the awful gloom. I &s;hall ever re&s;pect her for her love to my dear cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Never did I think, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he gave me her hand, to enter more the&s;e doors: But, living or dead, my <HI>Cla|ri&s;&s;a</HI> brings me after her any-whither!</P>
<P>She entered with me the little parlour. The moment &s;he &s;aw the coffin, &s;he withdrew her hand from mine, and with impatience pu&s;hed a&s;ide the lid. As impatiently &s;he re|moved the face-cloth. In a wild air, &s;he cla&s;ped her uplifted hands together; and now looked upon the corp&s;e, now up to Heaven, as if appealing her woes to that? Her bo|&s;om heaved and flutter'd di&s;cernible thro' her handker|chief,
<PB N="282" REF="283">
and at la&s;t &s;he broke &s;ilence;&mdash;O Sir!&mdash;See you not here!&mdash;See you not here&mdash;the Glory of her Sex?&mdash;Thus by the mo&s;t villainous of yours&mdash;Thus&mdash;laid low!</P>
<P>O my ble&s;&s;ed Friend, &s;aid &s;he!&mdash;My &s;weet Compa|nion!&mdash;My lovely Monitre&s;s!&mdash;ki&s;&s;ing her lips at every tender invocation. And is this All!&mdash;Is it All, of my CLARISSA's Story!</P>
<P>Then, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, and a profound &s;igh, &s;he turned to me, and then to her breathle&s;s friend&mdash;But <HI>is</HI> &s;he, <HI>can</HI> &s;he, be really dead!&mdash;O no! no!&mdash;She only &s;leeps&mdash;Awake, my beloved Friend! My &s;weet clay-cold Friend, awake! Let thy Anna Howe revive thee, my dear creature!&mdash;by her warm breath revive thee! And, ki&s;&s;ing her again, Let my warm lips animate thy cold ones!</P>
<P>Then, &s;ighing again, as from the bottom of her heart, and with an air, as if di&s;appointed that &s;he an&s;wered not, And can &s;uch perfection end thus!&mdash;And art thou really and indeed flown from thy Anna Howe!&mdash;O my unkind CLARISSA!</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent a few moments, and then, &s;eeming to re|cover her&s;elf, &s;he turned to me&mdash;Forgive, forgive, Mr. Morden, this wild fren&s;y!&mdash;I am not my&s;elf!&mdash;I never &s;hall be!&mdash;You know not the Excellence, no, not <HI>half</HI> the Excellence, that is thus laid low!&mdash;Repeating, This can|not, &s;urely, be All of my CLARISSA's Story!</P>
<P>Again pau&s;ing, One tear, my beloved friend, did&s;t thou allow me!&mdash;But this <HI>dumb</HI> &s;orrow!&mdash;O for a tear to ea&s;e my full-&s;woln heart, that is ju&s;t bur&s;ting!&mdash;</P>
<P>But why, Sir, why, Mr. Morden, was &s;he &s;ent <HI>hither</HI>? Why not to <HI>me</HI>?&mdash;She has no Father, no Mother, no Re|lations; no, not <HI>one!</HI>&mdash;They had all renounced her. I was her &s;ympathizing friend&mdash;And had not I the be&s;t right to my dear creature's remains?&mdash;And mu&s;t Names, without Nature, be preferred to &s;uch a Love as mine?</P>
<P>Again &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her lips, each cheek, her forehead&mdash;and &s;ighed as if her heart would break&mdash;</P>
<P>But why, why, &s;aid &s;he, was I with-held from &s;eeing my deare&s;t dear friend, before &s;he commenced Angel?&mdash;Delaying &s;till, and <HI>too ea&s;ily per&s;uaded</HI> to delay, the friendly vi&s;it that my heart panted after; what pain will this re|flection give me!&mdash;O my ble&s;&s;ed Friend! Who knows,
<PB N="283" REF="284">
who knows, had I come in time, what my cordial com|fortings might have done for thee!</P>
<P>But&mdash;looking round her, as if &s;he apprehended &s;eeing &s;ome of the family&mdash;One more ki&s;s, my Angel, my Friend, my ever-to-be-regretted lo&s;t Companion! And let me fly this hated hou&s;e, which I never loved but for thy &s;ake!&mdash;Adieu, then, my deare&s;t CLARISSA!&mdash;<HI>Thou</HI> art happy, I doubt not, as thou a&s;&s;ured&s;t me in thy la&s;t letter!&mdash;O may we meet, and rejoice together, where no villainous <HI>Love|laces,</HI> no hard-hearted <HI>Relations,</HI> will ever &s;hock our inno|cence, or ruffle our felicity!</P>
<P>Again &s;he was &s;ilent, unable to go, tho' &s;eeming to in|tend it; &s;truggling, as it were, with her grief, and heav|ing with angui&s;h: At la&s;t, happily, a flood of tears gu&s;hed from her eyes&mdash;Now!&mdash;Now!&mdash;&s;aid &s;he, &s;hall I&mdash;&s;hall I&mdash;be ea&s;ier. But for this kindly relief, my heart would have bur&s;t a&s;under&mdash;More, many more tears than the&s;e are due to my CLARISSA, who&s;e coun&s;el has done for me what mine could not do for her!&mdash;But why, looking earne&s;tly upon her, her hands cla&s;ped and lifted up&mdash;But why do I thus lament the HAPPY? And that thou art &s;o, is my comfort. It is, it is, my dear creature! ki&s;&s;ing her again.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir (turning to me, who was as much moved as her&s;elf); I loved the dear creature, as never woman loved another. Excu&s;e my frantic grief. How has the Glory of her Sex fallen a victim to villainy, and to hard-heartedne&s;s!</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid I, they All have it!&mdash;Now indeed they have it.&mdash;</P>
<P>And let them have it!&mdash;I &s;hould bely my Love for the friend of my heart, were I to pity them!&mdash;But how unhappy am I (looking upon the Corp&s;e) that I &s;aw her not before the&s;e Eyes were &s;hut, before the&s;e Lips were for ever clo&s;ed!&mdash;Oh! Sir, you know not the wi&s;dom that con|tinually flowed from the&s;e Lips, when &s;he &s;poke!&mdash;Nor what a Friend I have lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Then, &s;urveying the Lid, &s;he &s;eemed to take in at once the meaning of the emblems: And this gave her &s;o much fre&s;h grief, that tho' &s;he &s;everal times wiped her eyes, &s;he was unable to read the in&s;cription and texts: Turning
<PB N="284" REF="285">
therefore to me, Favour me, Sir, I pray you, by a line, with the de&s;cription of the&s;e emblems, and with the&s;e texts: And if I might be allowed a lock of the dear creature's hair&mdash;</P>
<P>I told her, that her Executor would order both; and would al&s;o &s;end her a copy of her Will; in which &s;he would find the mo&s;t grateful remembrances of her Love for her, whom &s;he calls <HI>The Si&s;ter of her Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;tly, &s;aid &s;he, does &s;he call me &s;o; for we had but one heart, but one &s;oul, between us: And now my better half is torn from me&mdash;<HI>what &s;hall I do?</HI></P>
<P>But looking round her, on a &s;ervant's &s;tepping by the door, as if again &s;he had apprehended it was &s;ome of the family&mdash;Once more, &s;aid &s;he, a &s;olemn, an everla&s;ting adieu!&mdash;Alas! for <HI>me,</HI> a &s;olemn, an everla&s;ting adieu!</P>
<P>Then again embracing her face with both her hands, and ki&s;&s;ing it, and afterwards the hands of the dear de|cea&s;ed, fir&s;t one, then the other, &s;he gave me her hand; and, quitting the room with precipitation, ru&s;h'd into her chariot; and, when there, with profound &s;ighs, and a fre&s;h bur&s;t of tears, unable to &s;peak, &s;he bowed her head to me, and was driven away.</P>
<P>The incon&s;olable company &s;aw how much I had been moved, on my return to them. Mr. James Harlowe had been telling them what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and me: And, finding my&s;elf unfit for company, and ob&s;erving, that they broke off talk at my coming-in; I thought it proper to leave them to their con&s;ultations.</P>
<P>And here I will put an end to this letter; for indeed, Sir, the very recollection of this affecting &s;cene has left me nearly as unable to proceed, as I was, ju&s;t after it, to con|ver&s;e with my cou&s;ins. I am, Sir, with great truth,</P>

<P>THE good Mrs. Norton is arrived, a little amended in her &s;pirits: Owing to the very po&s;thumous letters,
<PB N="285" REF="286">
as I may call them, which you, Mr. Belford, as well as I, apprehended would have had fatal effects upon her.</P>
<P>I cannot but attribute this to the right turn of her mind. It &s;eems &s;he has been inured to afflictions; and has lived in a con&s;tant hope of a <HI>better</HI> life, and, having no acts of unkindne&s;s to the dear decea&s;ed to reproach her&s;elf with, is mo&s;t con&s;iderately re&s;olved to exert her <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> fortitude, in order to comfort the &s;orrowing Mother.</P>
<P>O Mr. Belford, how does the character of my dear de|parted cou&s;in ri&s;e upon me from every mouth!&mdash;Had &s;he been my own child, or my &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;But do you think, that the man who occa&s;ioned this great, this extended ruin&mdash;But I forbear.</P>
<P>The Will is not to be looked into, till the funeral rites are performed. Preparations are making for the &s;olem|nity; and the &s;ervants, as well as principals, of all the branches of the family are put into deep mourning.</P>
<P>I have &s;een Mr. Melvill. He is a &s;erious and &s;en&s;ible man. I have given him particulars to go upon in the di&s;|cour&s;e he is to pronounce at the funeral: But had the le&s;s need to do this, as I find he is extremely well acquainted with the whole unhappy &s;tory; and was a per&s;onal ad|mirer of my dear cou&s;in, and a &s;incere lamenter of her misfortunes and death. The reverend Dr. Lewen, who is but very lately dead, was his particular friend, and had once intended to recommend him to her favour.</P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t returned from attending the afflicted parents, in an effort they made to &s;ee the corp&s;e of their beloved child. They had reque&s;ted my company, and that of the good Mrs. Norton. A la&s;t leave, the Mother &s;aid, &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> take.</P>
<P>An <HI>effort,</HI> however, it was, and no more. The mo|ment they came in &s;ight of the coffin, before the lid could be put a&s;ide, O my dear, &s;aid the Father, retreating, I can|not, I find I cannot, bear it!&mdash;Had I&mdash;Had I&mdash;Had I never been hard-hearted!&mdash;Then turning round to his Lady, he had but ju&s;t time to catch her in his arms, and prevent her &s;inking on the floor. O my deare&s;t life! &s;aid he, This is too much!&mdash;Too much indeed!&mdash;Let us, let us retire. Mrs. Norton, who (attracted by the aw|ful
<PB N="286" REF="287">
receptacle) had but ju&s;t left the good Lady, ha&s;tened to her&mdash;Dear, dear woman, cried the unhappy Parent, flinging her arms about her neck, Bear me, bear me, hence!&mdash;O my child! my child! My own Clari&s;&s;a Har|lowe! Thou pride of my life &s;o lately!&mdash;Never, never more, mu&s;t I behold thee!</P>
<P>I &s;upported the unhappy father, Mrs. Norton the &s;ink|ing mother, into the next parlour. She threw her&s;elf on a &s;ettee there: He into an elbow-chair by her: The good woman at her feet, her arms cla&s;ped round her wai&s;t. The two Mothers, as I may call them, of my beloved cou&s;in, thus tenderly engaged!&mdash;What a variety of di&s;tre&s;s in the&s;e woeful &s;cenes!</P>
<P>The unhappy father, in endeavouring to comfort his lady, loaded him&s;elf. Would to God, my dear, &s;aid he, would to God, I had no more to charge my&s;elf with, than you have!&mdash;<HI>You</HI> relented!&mdash;<HI>You</HI> would have prevailed upon <HI>me</HI> to relent!</P>
<P>The greater my fault, &s;aid &s;he, when I knew that di&s;plea&s;ure was carried too high, to acquie&s;ce, as I did! What a barbarous parent was I, to let two angry children make me forget that I was mother to a third&mdash;To <HI>&s;uch</HI> a third!&mdash;</P>
<P>Mrs. Norton u&s;ed arguments and prayers to comfort her&mdash;O my dear Norton, an&s;wered the unhappy lady, You was the dear creature's <HI>more natural</HI> Mother!&mdash;Would to heaven I had no more to an&s;wer for than <HI>you have!</HI></P>
<P>Thus the unhappy pair unavailingly recriminated, till my cou&s;in Hervey entered, and, with Mrs. Norton, con|ducted up to her own chamber the incon&s;olable Mother. The two Uncles, and Mr. Hervey, came in at the &s;ame time, and prevailed upon the afflicted Father to retire with them to his&mdash;Both giving up all thoughts of ever &s;eeing more the child, who&s;e death was &s;o de&s;ervedly regretted by them.</P>
<P>Time only, Mr. Belford, can combat with advantage &s;uch a heavy deprivation as this. Advice will not do, while the lo&s;s is recent. Nature will have way given to it (and &s;o it ought) till &s;orrow has in a manner exhau&s;ted it&s;elf; and then Rea&s;on and Religion will come in &s;ea&s;onably with their powerful aids, to rai&s;e the drooping heart.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXIII. Colonel <HI>MORDEN.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day Night, Sept.</HI> 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE are ju&s;t returned from the &s;olemnization of the la&s;t mournful Rite. My cou&s;in James and his Si&s;ter, Mr. and Mrs. Hervey, and <HI>their</HI> daughter, a young Lady who&s;e affection for my departed Cou&s;in &s;hall ever bind me to her; my cou&s;ins John and Antony Harlowe, my&s;elf, and &s;ome other more di&s;tant relations of the names of Fuller and Allin&s;on (who to te&s;tify their re&s;pect to the memory of the dear decea&s;ed, had put them&s;elves in mourn|ing, &s;elf-invited) attended it.</P>
<P>The Father and Mother would have joined in the&s;e la&s;t honours, had they been able: But they were both very much indi&s;po&s;ed; and continue to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The incon&s;olable Mother told Mrs. Norton, that the two Mothers of the &s;weete&s;t Child in the world, ought not, on this occa&s;ion, to be &s;eparated. She therefore de|&s;ired her to &s;tay with her.</P>
<P>The whole &s;olemnity was performed with great decency and order. The di&s;tance from Harlowe-place to the Church is about half a mile. All the way the corp&s;e was attended by great numbers of people of all conditions.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="290">It was nine when it entered the church. Every corner of which was cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded. Such a profound, &s;uch a &s;ilent re&s;pect did I never &s;ee paid at the funeral of princes. An attentive &s;adne&s;s over&s;pread the face of All.</P>
<P>The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill was a very pa|thetic one. He wiped his own eyes often; and made every body pre&s;ent &s;till oftener wipe theirs.</P>
<P>The auditors were mo&s;t particularly affected, when he told them, that the &s;olemn text was her own choice.</P>
<P>He enumerated her fine qualities, naming with honour their late worthy Pa&s;tor for his authority.</P>
<P>Every enumerated excellence was witne&s;&s;ed to in dif|ferent parts of the church in re&s;pectful whi&s;pers by dif|ferent per&s;ons, as of their own knowlege, as I have been &s;ince informed.</P>
<P>When he pointed to the pew where (doing credit to Re|ligion by her example) &s;he u&s;ed to &s;it or kneel, the whole auditory, as one per&s;on, turned to the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful &s;olemnity, as if &s;he had been her&s;elf there.</P>
<P>When the gentleman attributed conde&s;cen&s;ion and min|gled dignity to her, a buzzing approbation was given to the attribute throughout the church; and a poor neat wo|man under my pew added,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That &s;he was indeed all gra|ciou&s;ne&s;s, and would &s;peak to any body.'</Q></P>
<P>Many eyes ran over, when he mentioned her charities, her well-judged charities. And her reward was decreed from every mouth, with interjections from &s;ome, and the&s;e words from others, <Q REND="inline">'The poor will dearly mi&s;s her.'</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>chearful giver,</HI> whom God is &s;aid <HI>to love,</HI> was al|lowed to be <HI>her:</HI> And a young lady, I am told, &s;aid, It was Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe's care to find out the unhappy, upon a &s;udden di&s;tre&s;s, before the &s;ighing heart was over|whelmed by it.</P>
<P>She had a &s;et of poor people, cho&s;en for their remark|able hone&s;ty and ineffectual indu&s;try. The&s;e voluntarily paid their la&s;t attendance on their benefactre&s;s; and mingling in the church as they could croud near the eyle where the corp&s;e was on Stands, it was the le&s;s wonder that her prai&s;es from the Preacher met with &s;uch general and &s;uch grateful whi&s;pers of approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="291">Some it &s;eems there were who knowing her unhappy &s;tory, remarked upon the dejected looks of the Brother, and the drowned eyes of the Si&s;ter;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O what would they now give, they'd warrant, had they not been &s;o hard|hearted!'</Q>
&mdash;Others pur&s;ued, as I may &s;ay, the &s;evere Father and unhappy Mother into their chambers at home.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'They an&s;wered for their relenting, now, that it was too late!&mdash;What mu&s;t be their grief?&mdash;No <HI>wonder</HI> they could not be pre&s;ent!'</Q></P>
<P>Several expre&s;&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;hment, as people do every hour,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that a man could live whom &s;uch perfections could not engage to be ju&s;t to her,'</Q>
to be <HI>humane,</HI> I may &s;ay.&mdash;And who, her rank and fortune con&s;idered, could be &s;o di&s;regardful of his own <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> had he had no other motive to be ju&s;t!&mdash;</P>
<P>The good Divine, led by his text, ju&s;t touched upon the unhappy &s;tep that was the cau&s;e of her untimely fate. He attributed it to the State of things below, in which there could not be ab&s;olute perfection. He very politely touched upon the noble di&s;dain &s;he &s;hewed (tho' earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by a whole &s;plendid family) to join intere&s;ts with a man, whom &s;he found unworthy of her e&s;teem and con|fidence; and who courted her with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s to accept of him.</P>
<P>What he mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon was, the happy End &s;he made; and thence drew con&s;olation to her relations, and in&s;truction to the auditory.</P>
<P>In a word, his performance was &s;uch as heightened the reputation which he had before in a very eminent degree obtained.</P>
<P>When the corp&s;e was to be carried down into the vault, (a very &s;pacious one, within the church) there was great crouding to &s;ee the coffin-lid, and the devices upon it. Particularly two gentlemen, muffled up in cloaks, pre&s;&s;ed forward. The&s;e it &s;eems were Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyer|ley: Both of them pro&s;e&s;&s;ed admirers of my dear cou&s;in.</P>
<P>When they came near the coffin, and ca&s;t their eyes upon the lid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In that little &s;pace, &s;aid Mr. Mullins, is included all human excellence!'</Q>
&mdash;And then Mr. Wyer|ley, unable to contain him&s;elf, was forced to quit the church; and we hear is very ill.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="292">It is &s;aid, that Mr. Solmes was in a remote part of the church, wrapped round in a hor&s;eman's coat: And that he &s;hed tears &s;everal times. But I &s;aw him not.</P>
<P>Another gentleman was there incognito, in a pew near the entrance of the vault, who had not been taken notice of, but for his great emotion when he looked over his pew, at the time the coffin was carried down to its la&s;t place. This was Mi&s;s Howe's worthy Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>My cou&s;ins John and Antony, and their nephew James, cho&s;e not to de&s;cend into the vault among their departed ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harlowe was extremely affected. Her <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> as well as her Love, was concerned on the occa&s;ion. She would go down with the corp&s;e of her dear, her only Si&s;ter, &s;he &s;aid: But her Brother would not permit it. And her overwhelmed eye pur&s;ued the coffin till &s;he could &s;ee no more of it: And then &s;he threw her&s;elf on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat, and was near fainting away.</P>
<P>I accompanied it down, that I might not only &s;atisfy my&s;elf, but you, Sir, her Executor, that it was depo&s;ited, as &s;he had directed, at the feet of her grandfather.</P>
<P>Mr. Melvill came down, contemplated the lid, and &s;hed a few tears over it. I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o well &s;atisfied with his di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour, that I pre&s;ented him on the &s;o|lemn &s;pot with a ring of &s;ome value; and thanked him for his performance.</P>
<P>And here I left the Remains of my beloved co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;in; having be&s;poken my own place by the &s;ide of her coffin.</P>
<P>On my return to Harlowe-place, I con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nted my&s;elf with &s;ending my compliments to the &s;orrowing parents, and retired to my chamber.

<P>I Once had thoughts to go down privately, in order, di&s;gui&s;ed, to &s;ee the la&s;t &s;olemnity performed. But there was no need to give my&s;elf this melancholy trouble, &s;ince your la&s;t letter &s;o naturally de&s;cribes all that pa&s;&s;ed, that I have every &s;cene before my eyes.</P>

Now, thro' the buz of gaping, eye-&s;woln crouds, do I de&s;cend into the clammy vault, as a true Executor, to &s;ee that part of her Will performed with my own eyes. There, with a &s;oul filled with mu&s;ing, do I number the &s;urrounding monuments of mortality, and contemplate the pre&s;ent &s;tillne&s;s of &s;o many once bu&s;y vanities, crouded all into one poor vaulted nook, as if the living grudged room for the corps of tho&s;e, which when animated, the earth, the air, and the waters, could hardly find room for. Then &s;eeing her placed at the feet of him who&s;e earthly delight &s;he was; and who, as I find, a&s;cribes to the plea&s;ure &s;he gave him, the prolongation of his own life <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 29.</NOTE>; &s;ighing, and with averted face, I quit the &s;olemn man&s;ion, the &s;ymbolic coffin, and, for ever, the glory of her Sex, and a&s;cend with tho&s;e, who, in a few years, after a very &s;hort blaze of life, will fill up other &s;paces of the &s;ame vault, which now (while they mourn only for her, whom they jointly per&s;ecuted) they pre&s;s with their feet.</P>
<P>Nor do your affecting de&s;criptions permit me <HI>here</HI> to &s;top: But, a&s;cended, I mingle my tears and my prai&s;es with tho&s;e of the numerous &s;pectators.

<P>Occa&s;ions of litigation or offence &s;hall not proceed from me. You need only apply to Col. Morden, who &s;hall command me in every thing that the Will allows me to oblige your family in. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I am as un|willing to obtrude my&s;elf upon it, as any of it can wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I own, that I have not yet proved the Will; nor &s;hall I do it till next week at &s;oone&s;t, that you may have time for amicable objections, if &s;uch you think fit to make thro' the Colonel's mediation. But let me ob&s;erve to you, Sir,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That an Executor's power, in &s;uch in&s;tances as I have exerci&s;ed it, is the &s;ame before the Probate, as after it. He can even, without taking <HI>that</HI> out, <HI>commence</HI> an action, altho' he cannot <HI>declare</HI> upon it: And the&s;e Acts of Admini&s;tration make him liable to actions him&s;elf.'</Q>
I am therefore very <HI>proper</HI> in the &s;teps I have taken in part of the Execution of this &s;acred Tru&s;t; and want not <HI>allowance</HI> on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Permit me to add, That when you have peru&s;ed the Will, and coolly con&s;idered every thing, it is my hope, that you will your&s;elf be of opinion, that there can be no room for di&s;pute or oppo&s;ition: And that if your family will join to expedite the Execution, it will be the mo&s;t natural and ea&s;y way of &s;hutting up the whole affair, and to have done with a man, &s;o cau&s;ele&s;ly, as to his <HI>own</HI> par|ticular, the object of your di&s;like; as is, Sir,</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I Hope I may be excu&s;ed for expatiating, in divers parts of this &s;olemn la&s;t Act, upon &s;ubjects of importance.

<P>I have always earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, that my body might be depo&s;ited in the family vault with tho&s;e of my ance&s;tors. If it might be granted, I could now wi&s;h, that it may be placed at the feet of my dear and honoured grandfather. But as I have, by one very unhappy &s;tep, been thought to di&s;grace my whole lineage, and therefore this la&s;t honour may be refu&s;ed to my corp&s;e; in this ca&s;e, my de&s;ire is, that it may be interred in the church-yard belonging to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">he pari&s;h in which I &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">l die; and that in the mo&s;t private manner, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night; attended only by Mrs. Lovick, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and their maid-&s;ervant.</P>
<P>But it is my de&s;ire, that the &s;ame &s;ees and dues may be paid which are u&s;ually paid for tho&s;e who are laid in the be&s;t ground, as it is called, or even in the Chancel.&mdash;And I bequeath five pounds, to be given at the direction of the church-wardens, to twenty poor people the Sunday after my interrment; and This whether I &s;hall be buried here or el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>I have already given verbal directions, that after I am dead (and laid out in the manner I have ordered) I may be put into my coffin as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: It is my de&s;ire that I may not be unnece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed to the view of any body; except any of my relations &s;hould vouch&s;afe, for the la&s;t time, to look upon me.</P>
<P>And I could wi&s;h, if it might be avoided without making ill-will between Mr. Lovelace and my Executor, that the former might not be permitted to &s;ee my corp&s;e. But if, as he is a man very uncontroulable, and as I am Nobody's, he in&s;i&s;t upon viewing <HI>her d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad,</HI> whom he ONCE before &s;aw in a manner dead, let his gay curio&s;ity be gratified.

<P>In the fir&s;t place, I give and bequeath all the real e&s;tates in or to which I have any claim or title by the &s;aid Will, to my over-honoured father James Harlowe, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and that rather than to my brother and &s;i&s;ter, to whom I had once thoughts of devi&s;ing them, becau&s;e, if they &s;urvive my father, tho&s;e e&s;tates will a&s;&s;uredly ve&s;t in them, or one of them, by virtue of his favour and indulgence, as the circum&s;tances of things with regard to marriage-&s;ettlements, or otherwi&s;e, may require; or, as they may re&s;pectively me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by the continuance of their duty.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e late my grandfather's, called <HI>The Grove,</HI> and by him, in honour of me, and of &s;ome of my voluntary employ|ments, <HI>my dairy-hou&s;e,</HI> and the furniture thereof as it now &s;tands (the pictures and large iron c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t of old plate excepted) I al&s;o bequeath to my &s;aid father; only begging it as a favour, that he will be plea&s;ed to permit my dear Mrs. Norton to pa&s;s the remainder of her days in that hou&s;e; and to have and en|joy the apartments in it known by the name of <HI>The hou&s;e|keeper's apartments,</HI> with the furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ture in them; and which (plain and neat) was bought for me by my grandfather, who delighted to call me his hou&s;ekeeper; and which therefore in his life-time I u&s;ed as &s;uch: The office to go with the apart|ments.

<P>But with regard to what has accrued from that e&s;tate, &s;ince my grandfather's death, and to the &s;um of nine hundred and &s;e|venty pounds, which proved to be the moiety of the money that my &s;aid grandfather had by him at his death, and which moiety he bequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">athed to me for my &s;ole and &s;eparate u&s;e [as he did the other moiety, in like manner, to my &s;i&s;ter, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. I. p. 74.</NOTE>] and which &s;um, (that I might convince my brother and &s;i&s;ter, that I wi&s;hed not

But it is my will, and ex|pre&s;s direction, that my father's account of the above-mentioned produce may be taken and e&s;tabli&s;hed ab&s;olutely (and without contravention or que&s;tion) as he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to give it to my cou&s;in Morden, or to whom el&s;e he &s;hall choo&s;e to give it; &s;o as that the &s;aid account be not &s;ubject to litigation, or to the controul of my Executor, or any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>My father, of his love and bounty, was plea&s;ed to allow me the &s;ame quarterly &s;ums that he allowed my &s;i&s;ter for apparel and other requi&s;ites; and (plea&s;ed with me then) u&s;ed to &s;ay, that tho&s;e &s;ums &s;hould not he deducted from the e&s;tate and effects bequeathed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o me by my grandfather: But having <HI>mor|tally</HI> offended him (as I fear it may be &s;aid) by one unhappy &s;tep, it may be expected, that he will reimbur&s;e him&s;elf tho&s;e &s;ums&mdash;It is therefore my will and direction, that he &s;hall be allowed to pay and &s;atisfy him&s;elf for all &s;uch quarterly or other &s;ums, which he was &s;o good as to advance me from the time of my grandfather's death; and that his account of &s;uch &s;ums &s;hall likewi&s;e be taken without que&s;tioning: the money, however, which I left behind me in my e&s;critoire, being to be taken in part of tho&s;e di&s;bur&s;ements.</P>
<P>My grandfather, who, in his goodne&s;s and favour to me, knew no bounds, was plea&s;ed to bequeath to me all the fa|mily pictures at his late hou&s;e, &s;ome of which are very ma&s;terly performances; with command, that if I died unmarried, or if married and had no de&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndents, they &s;hould then go to that &s;on of his (if more than one &s;hould be then living) whom I &s;hould think would &s;et mo&s;t value by them. Now, as I know that my honoured uncle, John Harlowe, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s &s;ome concern that they were not left to him, as elde&s;t &s;on; and as he has a gallery where they may be placed to ad|vantage: and as I have rea&s;on to believe, that he will bequeath them to my father, if he &s;urvive him; who, no doubt, will leave them to my brother; I therefore bequeath all the &s;aid family pictures to my &s;aid uncle John Harlowe.

<P>To my Si&s;ter's maid Betty Barnes, I bequeath ten pounds, to &s;hew that I re&s;ent not former di&s;obligations; which I believe were owing more to the in&s;olence of office, and to natural pertne&s;s, than to per&s;onal ill-will.</P>
<P>All my wearing apparel, of whatever &s;ort, that I have not been obliged to part with, or which is not already bequeathed, (my linen excepted) I de&s;ire Mrs. Norton will accept of.</P>
<P>The trunks and boxes in which my cloaths are &s;ealed up, I de&s;ire may not be opened, but in pre&s;ence of Mrs. Norton (or of &s;ome one deputed by her) and of Mrs. Lovick.</P>
<P>To the worthy Mrs. Lovick abovementioned, from whom I have received great civilities, and even maternal kindne&s;&s;es; and to Mrs. Smith (with whom I lodge) from whom <HI>al&s;o</HI> I have received great kindne&s;&s;es; I bequeath all my linen, and all my un&s;old laces; to be divided equally between them, as they &s;hall agree; or, in ca&s;e of di&s;agreement, the &s;ame to be &s;old, and the money ari&s;ing to be equally &s;hared by them.</P>
<P>And I bequeath to the &s;ame two good women, as a further token of my thankful acknowlegements of their kind love and compa&s;&s;ionate concern for me, the &s;um of twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty guineas each.</P>
<P>To Mr. Smith, the hu&s;band of Mrs. Smith above-named, I bequeath the &s;um of ten guineas, in acknowlegement of his civilities to me.</P>
<P>To Sarah the hone&s;t maid-&s;ervant of Mrs. Smith, to whom (having no &s;ervant of my own) I have been trouble&s;ome, I be|queath five guineas; and ten guineas more, in lieu of a &s;uit of my wearing-apparel, which once, with &s;ome linen, I thought of leav|ing to her. With this &s;he may purcha&s;e what may be more &s;uitable to her liking and degree.</P>
<P>To the hone&s;t and careful wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow Ann Shelburne, my nur&s;e, over and above her wages, and the little cu&s;tomary perqui&s;ites
<PB N="305" REF="308">
that may belong to her, I bequeath the &s;um of ten guineas. Hers is a careful, and (to per&s;ons of &s;uch humanity and tender|ne&s;s) a melancholy employment, attended in the latter part of life with great watching and fatigue, which is hardly ever enough con&s;idered.</P>
<P>The few books I have at my pre&s;ent lodgings, I de&s;ire Mrs. Lovick to accept of; and that &s;he be permitted, if &s;he plea&s;e, to take a copy of my book of <HI>meditations,</HI> as I u&s;ed to call it; being extracts from the be&s;t of books; which &s;he &s;eemed to approve of, although &s;uited particularly to my own ca&s;e. As for the book it&s;elf, perhaps my good Mrs. Norton will be glad to have it, as it is written all with my own hand.</P>
<P>In the middle drawer of my e&s;critoire at Harlowe-place, are many letters and copies of letters, put up according to their dates, which I have written or received in a cour&s;e of years (ever &s;ince I learned to write) from and to my grandfather, my father and mother, my uncles, my brother and &s;i&s;ter, on oc|ca&s;ional little ab&s;ences; my late uncle Morden, my cou&s;in Mor|den; Mrs. Norton, and Mi&s;s Howe, and other of my compa|nions and friends before my confinement at my Father's: as al&s;o from the three reverend gentlemen, Dr. Blome, Mr. Ar|nold, and Mr. Tompkins, now with God; and the very reve|rend Dr. Lewen, on &s;erious &s;ubjects. As the&s;e letters exhibit a corre&s;pondence that no young per&s;on of my &s;ex need to be a&s;hamed of, allowing for the time of life when mine were written; and as many excellent things are contained in tho&s;e written to me; and as Mi&s;s Howe, to whom mo&s;t of them have been communicated, wi&s;hed formerly to have them, if &s;he &s;urvived me: for the&s;e rea&s;ons, I bequeath them to my &s;aid dear friend Mi&s;s Anna Howe; and the rather, as &s;he had for &s;ome years pa&s;t a very con&s;iderable &s;hare in the corre|&s;pondence.</P>
<P>I do hereby make, con&s;titute and ordain, John Belford, of Edgworth in the county of Middle&s;ex, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the &s;ole Executor of this my La&s;t Will and Te&s;tament; having previou&s;ly obtained his leave &s;o to do. I have given the rea&s;ons which induced me to a&s;k this gentleman to take upon him this trouble, to Mi&s;s Howe. I therefore refer to her on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly beg of him the &s;aid Mr. Belford, that, in the execution of this tru&s;t, he will (as he has repeatedly promi&s;ed) &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavour to promote peace with, and &s;uppre&s;s re&s;entments in every one; &s;o as that all farther mi&s;|chiefs may be prevented, as well <HI>from</HI> as <HI>to</HI> his friend. And in order to this, I be&s;eech him to cultivate the friend&s;hip of my worthy cou&s;in Morden; who, as I pre&s;ume to hope (when he

under&s;tands it to be my dying reque&s;t) will give him his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in every article where it may be nece&s;&s;ary; and who will perhaps be &s;o good as to interpo&s;e with my rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, if any difficulty &s;hould ari&s;e abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> carrying any of the articles of this my La&s;t Will into execution, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;often them in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the wi&s;hed-for conde&s;cen&s;ion:&mdash;For it is my earne&s;t reque&s;t to Mr. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lford, that he will not &s;eek by Law, or by any &s;ort of violence, either by word or deed, to extort the performance from <HI>them.</HI> If the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any articles of a merely dome&s;tic nature, that my relations &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ink unfit to be carried into execution; &s;uch articles I leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rely to my &s;aid cou&s;in Morden and Mr. Belford to vary, or totally di&s;pen&s;e with, as they &s;hall agree upon the matter; or, if they two diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r in opinion, they will be plea&s;ed to be determined by a third per&s;on, to be cho&s;en by them both.</P>
<P>Having been pre&s;&s;ed by Mi&s;s Howe and her mother, to col|lect the particulars of my &s;ad &s;tory, and given expectation that I would, in order to do my character ju&s;tice with all my friends and companions: but not having time before me for the pain|ful ta&s;k, it has been a plea&s;ure to me to find, by extracts kindly communicated to me by my &s;aid Executor, that I may &s;afely tru&s;t my fame to the ju&s;tice done me by Mr. Lovelace, in his letters to him my &s;aid Executor. And as Mr. Belford has engaged to contri|bute what is in his power towards a compilement to be made of all that relates to my &s;tory, and knows my whole mind in this re&s;pect; it is my de&s;ire, that he will cau&s;e two copies to be made of this collection; one to remain with Mi&s;s Howe, the other with him&s;elf; and that he will &s;hew or lend his copy, if required, to my aunt Hervey, for the &s;atisfaction of any of my family; but under &s;uch re&s;trictions as the &s;aid Mr. Bel|ford &s;hall think fit to impo&s;e; that neither any other per&s;on's &s;afety may be endangered, nor his own honour &s;uffer, by the communication.</P>
<P>I bequeath to my &s;aid Executor, the &s;um of one hundred guineas, as a grateful tho' in&s;ufficient acknowlegement of the trouble he will be at in the execution of the tru&s;t he has &s;o kindly undertaken. I de&s;ire him likewi&s;e to accept of twenty guineas for a ring. And that he will reimbur&s;e him&s;elf for all the charges and expences which he &s;hall be at in the execution of this tru&s;t.</P>
<P>In the worthy Dr. H. I have found a phy&s;ician, a father and a friend. I beg of him, as a te&s;timony of my gratitude, to accept of twenty guineas for a ring.</P>
<P>I have the &s;ame obligations to the kind and &s;kilful Mr. Cod|dard, who attended me as my apothecary. His very moderate
<PB N="307" REF="310">
till I have di&s;charged down to ye&s;terday. I have always thought it incumbent upon te&s;tators to &s;horten all they can the trouble of their executors. I know I u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der-rate the value of Mr. God|dard's attendances, when over and above what may accrue from ye&s;terday, to the hour that will fini&s;h all, I de&s;ire fifteen guineas for a ring may be pre&s;ented to him.</P>
<P>To the reverend Mr.&mdash;who frequently attended me and prayed by me in my la&s;t &s;tages, I al&s;o bequeath fifteen guineas for a ring.</P>
<P>There are a &s;et of hone&s;t indigent people, whom I u&s;ed to call <HI>my poor,</HI> and to whom Mrs. Norton conveys relief each month, or at &s;horter periods, in proportion to their nece&s;&s;ities, from a &s;um I depo&s;ited in her hands, and from time to time recruited, as means accrued to me; but now nearly, if not wholly expended: Now, that my fault may be as little aggravated as po&s;&s;ible by the &s;ufferings of the worthy people whom Heaven gave me a heart to relieve; and as the produce of my Grandfa|ther's e&s;tate (including the moiety of the &s;ums he had by him, and was plea&s;ed to give me at his death, as above-mentioned) together with what I &s;hall further appropriate to the &s;ame u&s;e in the &s;ub&s;equent articles, will, as I hope, more than an&s;wer all my legacies and beque&s;ts; it is my will and de&s;ire, that the re|mainder, be it little or much, &s;hall become a fund to be appro|priated, and I hereby direct, that it be appropriated, to the like purpo&s;es with the &s;ums which I put into Mrs. Norton's hands, as afore&s;aid&mdash;And this under the direction and management of the &s;aid Mrs. Norton, who knows my whole mind in this particular. And in ca&s;e of her death, or of her de&s;ire to be acquitted of the management thereof; it is my earne&s;t reque&s;t to my dear Mi&s;s Howe, that &s;he will take it upon her&s;elf: and at her own death, that &s;he will transfer what &s;hall remain un|di&s;po&s;ed of at the <HI>time,</HI> to &s;uch per&s;ons, and with &s;uch limita|tions, re&s;trictions and provi&s;oes, as &s;he &s;hall think will be&s;t an|&s;wer my intention. For, as to the management and di&s;tribu|tion of all or any part of it, while in Mrs. Norton's hands or her own, I will, that it be intirely di&s;cretional, and without account, either to my Executor or any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>Altho' Mrs. Norton, as I have hinted, knows my whole mind in this re&s;pect; yet it may be proper to mention, in this la&s;t &s;olemn Act, that my intention is, that this fund be intirely &s;et apart and appropriated to relieve temporarily, from the in|tere&s;t thereof (as I dare &s;ay it will be put out to the be&s;t advan|tage) or even from the principal, if need be, the hone&s;t, in|du&s;trious, labouring poor only; when &s;ickne&s;s, lamene&s;s, un|fore&s;een lo&s;&s;es, or other accidents di&s;able them from following their lawful callings; or to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch hone&s;t people of large
<PB N="308" REF="311">
families as &s;hall have a child of good inclinations to put out to &s;ervice, trade or hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>It has always been a rule with me in my little donations, to endeavour to aid and &s;et forward the &s;ober and indu&s;trious poor. Small helps, if &s;ea&s;onably afforded, will do for &s;uch; and &s;o the fund may be of more exten&s;ive benefit: an ocean of wealth will not be &s;ufficient for the idle and di&s;&s;olute: whom, therefore, &s;ince they will be always in want, it will be no cha|rity to relieve, if worthier creatures &s;hall by that means be de|prived of &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as may &s;et the wheels of their indu&s;try going, and put them in a &s;phere of u&s;eful action.</P>
<P>But it is my expre&s;s will and direction, that let this fund come out to be ever &s;o con&s;iderable, it &s;hall be applied only in &s;upport of the <HI>temporary exigencies</HI> of the per&s;ons I have de|&s;cribed; and that no one family or per&s;on receive from it, at one time, or in one year, more than the &s;um of twenty pounds.</P>
<P>It is my will and de&s;ire, that the &s;et of jewels which was my grandmother's, and pre&s;ented to me &s;oon after her death by my grandfather, be valued; and the worth of them paid to my Executor, if any of my family choo&s;e to have them; or other|wi&s;e, that they be &s;old, and go to the augmentation of my poor's fund.&mdash;But if they may be deemed an equivalent for the &s;ums my father was plea&s;ed to advance to me &s;ince the death of my grandfather, I de&s;ire, that they may be given up to him.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, that the diamond necklace, &s;olitaire, and buckles, which were properly my own, pre&s;ented by my mother's uncle Sir Jo&s;ias Brookland, will not be purcha&s;ed by any one of my family, for a too obvious rea&s;on: in this ca&s;e I de&s;ire, that they may be &s;ent to my Executor; and that he will di&s;po&s;e of them to the be&s;t advantage; and apply the money to the u&s;es of my will.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this tedious writing, I referred to the latter part of it, the naming of the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e which I wi&s;hed might be delivered at my funeral, if per|mitted to be interred with my ance&s;tors: I think the following will be &s;uitable to my ca&s;e.

<P>I Have been employed in a mo&s;t melancholy ta&s;k. In reading the Will of the dear decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The unhappy Mother and Mrs. Norton cho&s;e to be ab|&s;ent on the affecting occa&s;ion. But Mrs. Harlowe made it her earne&s;t reque&s;t, that every article of it &s;hould be ful|filled.</P>
<P>They were all extremely touched with the preamble.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t words of the Will&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, now by &s;trange melancholy accidents, lodging,'</Q>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> drew tears from &s;ome, &s;ighs from all.</P>
<P>The directions for her funeral, in ca&s;e &s;he were or were not permitted to be carried down; the mention of her or|ders having been given for the manner of her being laid out, and the pre&s;ence of mind &s;o vi&s;ible throughout the whole, obtained their admiration, expre&s;&s;ed by hands and eyes lifted up, and by falling tears.</P>
<P>When I read the direction,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That her body was not to be viewed, except any of her relations &s;hould vouch&s;afe for the la&s;t time to look upon her;'</Q>
they turned away, and turned to me, three or four times alternately. Mrs. Hervey and Mi&s;s Arabella &s;obbed; the Uncles wiped their eyes; the Brother looked down; the Father wrung his hands.</P>
<P>I was obliged to &s;top at the words,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That &s;he was <HI>No-body's.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>But when I came to the addre&s;s to be made to the ac|cur&s;ed man,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'if he were not to be diverted from &s;eeing <HI>her</HI> dead, whom once before he had &s;een in a manner dead'</Q>
&mdash;execration, and either vows or wi&s;hes of re|venge, filled every mouth.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;till more fervently renewed, when they came to hear read her forgivene&s;s of even this man.</P>
<P>You remember, Sir, on our fir&s;t reading of the Will i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> town, the ob&s;ervations I made on the foul play which it is evident the excellent creature met with from this aban|doned man, and what I &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion. I am not u&s;ed to repeat things of that nature.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="314">The dear creature's noble contempt of the <HI>Nothing,</HI> as &s;he as nobly calls it, about which &s;he had been giving &s;uch particular directions, to wit, her Body; and her apolo|gizing for the particularity of tho&s;e directions from the circum&s;tances &s;he was in&mdash;had the &s;ame, and as &s;trong an effect upon me, as when I fir&s;t read the animated para|graph; and, pointed by my eye (by turns ca&s;t upon them all) affected them all.</P>
<P>When the article was read which bequeathed to the fa|ther the grandfather's e&s;tate, and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it (&s;o generous and &s;o dutiful) the father could &s;it no longer, but withdrew, wiping his eyes, and lifting up his hands at Mr. James Harlowe; who aro&s;e to attend him to the door, as Arabella likewi&s;e did&mdash;All he could &s;ay&mdash;O Son! Son!&mdash;O Girl! Girl!&mdash;as if he reproached them for the parts they had acted, and put him upon acting.</P>
<P>But yet, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, this Brother and Si&s;ter &s;hew|ed them&s;elves to be true Will-di&s;putants.</P>
<P>Let tongue and eyes expre&s;s what they will, Mr. Bel|ford, the reading of a Will, where a per&s;on dies worth any|thing con&s;iderable, generally affords a true te&s;t of love to the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The cloaths, the thirty guineas for mourning to Mrs. Norton, with the recommendation of the good woman for hou&s;ekeeper at <HI>The Grove,</HI> were thought &s;ufficient, had the article of 600 <HI>l.</HI> which was called mon&s;trous, been omitted. Some other pa&s;&s;ages in the Will were called <HI>flights, and &s;uch whim&s;ies as di&s;tingui&s;h people of imagina|tion from tho&s;e of judgment.</HI></P>
<P>My cou&s;in Dolly Hervey was grudged the Library. Mi&s;s Harlowe &s;aid, That as &s;he and her &s;i&s;ter never bought the &s;ame books, &s;he would take that to her&s;elf, and would <HI>make it up</HI> to her cou&s;in Dolly <HI>one way or other.</HI></P>
<P>I intend, Mr. Belford, to &s;ave you the trouble of inter|po&s;ing&mdash;The Library &s;hall be my cou&s;in Dolly's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hervey could hardly keep her &s;eat. On <HI>this</HI> oc|ca&s;ion, however, &s;he only &s;aid, That her late dear and <HI>ever</HI> dear niece, was <HI>too good</HI> to her and <HI>hers.</HI> But, <HI>at another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &s;he declared, with tears, that &s;he could not forgive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;elf for a letter &s;he wrote <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>III.</HI> p. <HI>248.</HI></NOTE> (looking at Mi&s;s Arabella,

whom, it &s;eems, unknown to any-body, &s;he had con&s;ulted before &s;he wrote it) and which, &s;he &s;aid, mu&s;t have wound|ed a &s;pirit, that now, &s;he &s;aw, had been too deeply wound|ed before.</P>
<P>O my aunt, &s;aid Arabella, no more of that!&mdash;Who would have thought that the dear creature had been &s;uch a penitent?</P>
<P>Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe were &s;o much af|fected with the articles in their favour (bequeathed to them without a word or hint of reproach or recrimination) that they broke out into &s;elf accu&s;ations; and lamented, that their &s;weet niece, as they called her, was now got above all grateful acknowlegement and returns.</P>
<P>Indeed, the mutual upbraidings and grief of all pre&s;ent, upon tho&s;e articles in which every one was remembered for good, &s;o often interrupted me, that the reading took up above &s;ix hours. But cur&s;es upon the accur&s;ed man were a refuge to which they often re&s;orted, to exonerate them&s;elves.</P>
<P>How wounding a thing, Mr. Belford, is a generous and well-di&s;tingui&s;hed forgivene&s;s! What Revenge can be more effectual and more noble, were Revenge intended, and were it wi&s;hed to &s;trike remor&s;e into a guilty or in|grateful heart! But my dear cou&s;in's motives were all Duty and Love. She &s;eems indeed to have been, as much as mortal could be, LOVE it&s;elf. Love &s;ublimed by a purity, by a true delicacy, that hardly any woman before her could boa&s;t of. O Mr. Belford, what an Example would &s;he have given in every &s;tation of life (as Wife, Mother, Mi&s;tre&s;s, Friend, had her lot fallen upon a man ble&s;&s;ed with a mind like her own!</P>
<P>The 600 <HI>l.</HI> bequeathed to Mrs. Norton, the Library to Mi&s;s Hervey, and the Remembrances to Mi&s;s Howe, were not the only articles grudged. Yet to what purpo&s;e did they regret the pecuniary beque&s;ts, when the Poors fund, and not them&s;elves, would have had the benefit, had not tho&s;e legacies been bequeathed?</P>
<P>But enough pa&s;&s;ed to convince me, that my cou&s;in was ab&s;olutely right in her choice of an Executor out of the family. Had &s;he cho&s;en one in it, I dare &s;ay, that her Will would have been no more regarded than if it had been
<PB N="313" REF="316">
the Will of a dead King; than that of Louis XIV. in particular; &s;o flagrantly broken thro' by his nephew the Duke of Orleans before he was cold. The only will of that Monarch perhaps which was ever di&s;puted.</P>
<P>But little does Mr. James Harlowe think, that while he is gra&s;ping at hundreds, he will mo&s;t probably lo&s;e thou|&s;ands, if he be my &s;urvivor. A man of a &s;pirit &s;o &s;elfi&s;h and narrow, &s;hall not be my heir.</P>
<P>You will better conceive, Mr. Belford, than I can ex|pre&s;s, how much they were touched at the hint, that the dear creature had been obliged to part with &s;ome of her cloaths.</P>
<P>Silent reproach &s;eized every one of them, when I came to the pa&s;&s;age where &s;he mentions, that &s;he deferred filling up &s;ome blanks, in hopes of receiving their la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing and forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>I will only add, that they could not bear to hear read the concluding part, &s;o &s;olemnly addre&s;&s;ed to her Redeem|er. They all aro&s;e from their &s;eats, and crouded out of the apartment we were in. And then, as I afterwards found, &s;eparated, in order to &s;eek that con&s;olation in &s;oli|tary retirement, which, tho' they could not hope for from their own reflections, yet, at the time, they had le&s;s rea|&s;on to expect in each other's company.

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very apprehen&s;ive, that the affair between Mr. Lovelace and the late excellent Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe will be attended with further bad con&s;equences, notwith|&s;tanding her dying injunctions to the contrary. I would therefore humbly propo&s;e, that your Lord&s;hip and his other relations will forward the purpo&s;e your kin&s;man lately had to go abroad; where I hope he will &s;tay till all is blown over. But as he will not &s;tir, if he know the true motives of your wi&s;hes, the avowed inducement, as I hinted once to Mr. Mowbray, may be &s;uch as re&s;pects

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Lord having the gout in his right-hand, his Lord|&s;hip, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, have com|manded me to inform you, that before your letter came Mr. Lovelace was preparing for a foreign tour. We &s;hall endeavour to ha&s;ten him away on the motives you &s;ug|ge&s;t.</P>
<P>We are all extremely affected with the dear lady's death. Lady Betty and Lady Sarah have been indi&s;po&s;ed ever &s;ince they heard of it. They had plea&s;ed them&s;elves, as had my &s;i&s;ter and &s;elf, with the hopes of cultivating her acquaintance and friend&s;hip after he was gone abroad, upon her own terms. Her kind remembrance of each of us has renewed, tho' it could not heighten, our regrets for &s;o irreparable a lo&s;s. We &s;hall order Mr. Finch, our gold&s;mith, to wait on you. He has our directions about the rings. They will be long, long worn in memory of the dear te&s;tatrix.</P>
<P>Every-body is a&s;&s;ured, that you will do all in your power to prevent <HI>farther</HI> ill con&s;equences from this me|lancholy affair. My Lord de&s;ires his compliments to you. I am, SIR,</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="315" REF="318">This collection having run into a much greater length than was wi&s;hed, it is thought proper to omit &s;everal Let|ters that pa&s;&s;ed between Colonel Morden, Mi&s;s Howe, Mr. Belford, and Mr. Hickman, in relation to the execution of the Lady's Will, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It is however nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve on this &s;ubject, That the unhappy mother, being &s;upported by the two uncles, influenced the afflicted father to over-rule all his &s;on's ob|jections, and to direct a literal ob&s;ervation of the Will; and at the &s;ame time to give up all the &s;ums which he was impowered by it to reimbur&s;e him&s;elf; as al&s;o to take upon him&s;elf to defray the funeral expences.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford &s;o much obliged Mi&s;s Howe by his &s;tea|dine&s;s, equity, and di&s;patch, and by his readine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to contri|bute to the directed collection, that &s;he voluntarily entered into a corre&s;pondence with him, as the repre&s;entative of her beloved friend. In the cour&s;e of which, he communicated to her (in confidence) the Letters which pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mr. Lovelace, and, by Colonel Morden's con&s;ent, tho&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed between that gentleman and him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;ent with the fir&s;t parcel of letters which he had tran&s;cribed out of &s;hort-hand for Mi&s;s Howe, a letter to Mr. Hickman, dated the 16th of September; in which he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But I ought, Sir, in this parcel to have kept out one letter. It is that which relates to the interview between your&s;elf and Mr. Lovelace, at Mr. Dormer's <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>VI.</HI> Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE>. In which Mr. Lovelace treats you with an air of levity, which neither your per&s;on, your character, nor your com|mi&s;&s;ion, de&s;erved; but which was his u&s;ual way of treating every one who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s he was not plea&s;ed with. I hope, Sir, you have too much greatne&s;s of mind, to be di&s;turbed at this letter, &s;hould Mi&s;s Howe communicate it to you; and the rather, as it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould &s;uffer with her on that account.'</Q>
He then excu&s;es Mr. Lovelace, as a good-natured man, with all his faults: and gives in&s;tances of his &s;till greater freedoms with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To this Mr. Hickman an&s;wers, in his letter of the 18th.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As to Mr. Lovelace's treatment of me in the letter you are plea&s;ed to mention, I &s;hall not be concerned at it,
<PB N="316" REF="319">
whatever it be. I went to him prepared to expect odd behaviour from him; and was not di&s;appointed. I ar|gue to my&s;elf, in all &s;uch ca&s;es as this, as Mi&s;s Howe, from her ever-dear friend, argues, <HI>That if the reflections thrown upon me</HI> are ju&s;t, <HI>I ought not only to forgive them, but to endeavour to profit by them:</HI> If unju&s;t, <HI>that I ought to de&s;pi&s;e them, and the reflecter too; &s;ince it would be in|excu&s;able to &s;trengthen by anger an enemy who&s;e malice might be di&s;armed by contempt.</HI> And, moreover, I &s;hould be almo&s;t &s;orry to find my&s;elf &s;poken well of by a man who could treat as he treated a lady who was an orna|ment to her &s;ex, and to human nature.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I thank you, however, Sir, adds he, for your con&s;i|deration for me in this particular; and for your whole letter, which gives me &s;o de&s;irable an in&s;tance of that friend&s;hip which you honoured me with the a&s;&s;urances of, when I was la&s;t in town; and which I as cordially embrace, as wi&s;h to cultivate.'</Q></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe, in hers of the 20th, acknowleging the re|ceipt of the letters, and papers, and legacies, &s;ent with Mr. Belford's letter to Mr. Hickman, a&s;&s;ures him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That no u&s;e &s;hall be made of his communications, but what he &s;hall approve of.'</Q></P>
<P>He had mentioned with compa&s;&s;ion the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Harlowe family&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Per&s;ons of a <HI>pitiful nature,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>may</HI> pity them. I am not one of tho&s;e. You, I think, pity the infernal man likewi&s;e; while I from my heart grudge him his phren&s;y, becau&s;e it deprives him of that remor&s;e, which, I hope, on his recovery, will never leave him. At times, Sir, let me tell you, that I hate your whole Sex for his &s;ake; even men of unblameable cha|racters; whom at tho&s;e times I cannot but look upon as per&s;ons I have not yet <HI>found out.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'If my dear creature's per&s;onal jewels, proceeds &s;he, be &s;ent up to you for &s;ale, I de&s;ire that I may be the pur|cha&s;er of them, at the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> price&mdash;Of the necklace and &s;olitaire particularly.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O what tears did the peru&s;al of my beloved's Will co&s;t me!&mdash;But I mu&s;t not touch upon the heart-piercing &s;ub|ject. I can neither take it up, nor quit it, but with exe|cration of the villain whom all the world mu&s;t execrate.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="320">Mr. Belford, in his an&s;wer, promi&s;es, that &s;he &s;hall be the purcha&s;er of the jewels, if they come into his hands.</P>
<P>He acquaints her, that the family had given Col. Morden the keys of all that belonged to the dear departed: That the unhappy mother had (as the Will allows) ordered a piece of needlework to be &s;et a&s;ide for her, and had de|&s;ired Mrs. Norton to get the little book of <HI>Meditations</HI> tran&s;cribed, and to let her have the original, as it was all of her dear daughter's hand-writing; and as it might, when &s;he could bear to look into it, admini&s;ter con&s;olation to her&s;elf. And that &s;he had likewi&s;e re&s;erved for her&s;elf her picture in the Vandyke ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Mr. Belford &s;ends with this letter to Mi&s;s Howe the la|dy's memorandum-book; and promi&s;es to &s;end her copies of the &s;everal po&s;thumous letters. He tells her, that Mr. Lovelace being upon the recovery, he had inclo&s;ed the po&s;thumous letter directed for him to Lord M. that his Lord&s;hip might give it to him, or not, as he &s;hould find he could bear it. The following is a copy of that Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>LOVELACE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, Aug.</HI> 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Told you, in the letter I wrote to you on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> la&s;t <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>See p. 17. of this Volume.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader may ob&s;erve, by the date of this letter, that it was written within two days of the allegorical one, to which it refers; and while the lady was labouring under the increa&s;ed illne&s;s occa&s;ioned by the burries and terrors which Mr. Lovelace had put her into, to avoid the vi&s;it he was &s;o earne&s;t to make her at Smith's&mdash;So early written, perhaps, that &s;he might not be &s;urpri&s;ed by death into a &s;eeming breach of her word.</P>
<P>High as her Chri&s;tian &s;pirit &s;oars in this letter, the reader has &s;een, in Letter <HI>xlviii.</HI> and in other places, that that exalted &s;pirit carried her to &s;till more divine elevations, as &s;he drew nearer to her end,</P></NOTE>, that you &s;hould have another &s;ent you when I had got to <HI>my Father's hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that I am <HI>now,</HI> at your receiving of This, arrived there; and I invite you to follow me, as &s;oon as you can be <HI>prepared</HI> for &s;o great a journey.</P>
<P>Not to allegorize further&mdash;My fate is <HI>now,</HI> at your peru&s;al of this, accompli&s;hed. My doom is unalterably fixed: And I am either a mi&s;erable, or a happy being to all Eternity. If <HI>happy,</HI> I owe it &s;olely to the Divine mer|cy:
<PB N="318" REF="321">
If <HI>mi&s;erable,</HI> to your unde&s;erved cruelty.&mdash;And con|&s;ider now, for your own &s;ake, gay, cruel, fluttering, un|happy man! con&s;ider, whether the barbarous and perfi|dious treatment I have m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t with from you, was worthy of the hazard of your immortal &s;oul; &s;ince your wicked views were not to be effected but by the wilful breach of the mo&s;t &s;olemn vows that ever were made by man; and tho&s;e aided by a violence and ba&s;ene&s;s unworthy of a hu|man creature.</P>
<P>In time then, once more, I wi&s;h you to con&s;ider your ways. Your golden dream cannot long la&s;t. Your pre|&s;ent cour&s;e can yield you plea&s;ure no longer than you can keep off thought or reflection. A hardened in&s;en&s;ibility is the only foundation on which your inward tranquillity is built. When once a dangerous &s;ickne&s;s &s;eizes you; when once effectual remor&s;e breaks in upon you; how dreadful will be your condition! How poor a triumph will you then find it, to have been able, by a &s;eries of black perjuries, and &s;tudied ba&s;ene&s;s, under the name of Gallantry or Intrigue, to betray poor unexperienced young creatures, who perhaps knew nothing but their duty till they knew you!&mdash;Not one good action in the hour of lan|gui&s;hing to recollect, not one worthy intention to revolve, it will be all con&s;cience and horror; and you will wi&s;h to have it in your power to compound for annihilation.</P>
<P>Reflect, Sir, that I can have no other motive in what I write, than your good, and the &s;afety of other innocent creatures, who may be drawn in by your wicked arts and perjuries. You have not, in my wi&s;hes for your future welfare, the wi&s;hes of a &s;uppliant wife, endeavouring for her <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, as well as for <HI>yours,</HI> to induce you to reform tho&s;e ways. They are wholly di&s;intere&s;ted, as unde&s;erved. But I &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t my own penitence, were I capable of wi&s;hing to recompen&s;e evil for evil&mdash;if, black as your offences have been again&s;t me, I could not forgive, as I wi&s;h to be forgiven.</P>
<P>I repeat, therefore, that I <HI>do</HI> forgive you. And may the Al|mighty forgive you too! Nor have I, at the writing of this, any other e&s;&s;ential regrets than what are occa&s;ioned by the grief I have given to parents, who till I knew you were the mo&s;t indulgent of parents; by the &s;candal given to the other
<PB N="319" REF="322">
branches of my family; by the di&s;reputation brought upon my Sex; and by the offence given to Virtue in my fall.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf, you have only robbed me of what once were my favourite expectations in the tran&s;ient life I &s;hall have quitted when you receive This. You have only been the cau&s;e that I have been cut off in the bloom of youth, and of curtailing a life, that might have been agreeable to my&s;elf, or otherwi&s;e, as had &s;uited the de&s;igns and ends of Providence. I have rea&s;on to be thankful, for being ta|ken away from the evil of &s;upporting my part of a yoke, with a man &s;o <HI>unhappy</HI> I will only &s;ay, that, in all pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|bability, every hour I had lived with him might have brought with it &s;ome new trouble. And I am (indeed through &s;harp afflictions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es) indebted to you, <HI>&s;econdarily,</HI> as I humbly pre&s;ume to hope, for &s;o many years of glory, as might have proved years of danger, temptation, and angui&s;h, had they been added to my mor|tal life.</P>
<P>So, Sir, tho' no thanks to your <HI>intention,</HI> you have done me <HI>real &s;ervice</HI>; and in return, I wi&s;h you happy. But &s;uch has been your life hitherto, that you can have no time to lo&s;e, in &s;etting about your repentance. Re|pentance to &s;uch as have lived only carele&s;ly, and in the omi&s;&s;ion of their regular duties, and who never aimed to draw any poor creatures into evil, is not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k, nor &s;o much in our own power, as &s;ome imagine. How difficult a grace then to be obtained, where the guilt is premeditated, wilful, and complicated!</P>
<P>To &s;ay I once re&s;pected you with a preference, is what I ought to blu&s;h to own, &s;ince at the very time, I was far from thinking you even a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral man; tho' I little thought that you, or indeed that any man breathing, could be what you have proved your&s;elf to be. But, indeed, Sir, I have long been greatly above you: For, from my heart I have de&s;pi&s;ed you, and all your ways, ever &s;ince I &s;aw what manner of man you were.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be wondered, that I &s;hould be able &s;o to do, when that preference was not grounded on ignoble motives. For I was weak enough, and pre&s;umptuous enough, to hope to be a means in the hand of Providence to reclaim a man, whom I thought worthy of the attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="323">Nor have I yet, as you will &s;ee by the pains I take, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this &s;olemn occa&s;ion, to awaken you out of your &s;en&s;ual dream, given over all hopes of this nature.</P>
<P>Hear me therefore, O Lovelace! as one &s;peaking from the dead&mdash;Lo&s;e no time&mdash;Set about your repentance in|&s;tantly&mdash;Be no longer the in&s;trument of Satan, to draw poor &s;ouls into tho&s;e &s;ubtile &s;nares, which at la&s;t &s;hall in|tangle your own feet. Seek not to multiply your offences, till they become beyond the <HI>power,</HI> as I may &s;ay, of the Divine Mercy to forgive; &s;ince <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> no le&s;s than <HI>mercy,</HI> is an attribute of the Almighty.</P>
<P>Tremble and reform, when you read what is <HI>the portion of the wicked man from God.</HI> Thus it is written:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The triumphing of the wicked is &s;hort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. He is ca&s;t into a net by his own feet&mdash;He walketh upon a &s;nare. Terrors &s;hall make him afraid on every &s;ide, and &s;hall drive him to his feet. His &s;trength &s;hall be hunger-bitten, and de&s;truction &s;hall be ready at his &s;ide. The fir&s;t-born of death &s;hall devour his &s;trength. His remembrance &s;hall peri&s;h from the earth; and he &s;hall have no name in the &s;treets. He &s;hall be cha&s;ed out of the world. He &s;hall neither have &s;on nor nephew among his people. They that have &s;een him, &s;hall &s;ay, Where is he? He &s;hall &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y away as a dream: He &s;hall be cha&s;ed away as a vi&s;ion of the night. His meat is the gall of a&s;ps within him. He &s;hall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of &s;teel &s;hall &s;trike him thro'. A fire not blown &s;hall con&s;ume him. The heaven &s;hall reveal his ini|quity, and the earth &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t him. The worm &s;hall feed &s;weetly on him. He &s;hall be no more remembered.&mdash;This is the fate of him that knoweth not God.'&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Whenever you &s;hall be inclined to con&s;ult the Sacred Oracles, from whence the above threatenings are extracted, you will find doctrines and texts, which a truly penitent and contrite heart may lay hold of for its con&s;olation.</P>
<P>May yours, Mr. Lovelace, become &s;uch! And may you be enabled to e&s;cape the fate denounced again&s;t the abandoned man, and be intitled to the mercies of a long|&s;uffering and gracious God, is the &s;incere prayer of</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedn. Sept.</HI> 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Write to demand back again my la&s;t letter. I own it was my mind at the different times I wrote it; and, whatever ailed me, I could not <HI>help</HI> writing it. Such a gloomy impul&s;e came upon me, and increa&s;ed as I wrote, that, for my &s;oul, I could not forbear running into the Mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;trange, very &s;trange, that a man's con&s;cience &s;hould be able to force his fingers to write whether he will or not; and to run him into a &s;ubject he more than once, at the very time, re&s;olved not to think of.</P>
<P>Nor is it le&s;s &s;trange, that (no new rea&s;on occurring) he &s;hould, in a day or two more, &s;o totally change his mind; have his mind, I &s;hould rather &s;ay, &s;o wholly illuminated by gay hopes, and ri&s;ing pro&s;pects, as to be a&s;hamed of what he had written.</P>
<P>For, on reperu&s;al of a copy of my letter, which fell into my hands by accident, in the hand-writing of my cou&s;in
<PB N="326" REF="329">
Charlotte, who, unknown to me, had tran&s;cribed it, I find it to be &s;uch a letter as an enemy would rejoice to &s;ee.</P>
<P>This I know, that were I to have continued but one week more in the way I was in when I wrote the latter part of it, I &s;hould have been confined, and in &s;traw, the next: For I now recollect, that all my di&s;temper was returning upon me with irre&s;i&s;tible violence&mdash;and that in &s;pite of water-gruel and &s;oupe maigre.</P>
<P>I own, that I am &s;till exce&s;&s;ively grieved at the di&s;ap|pointment this admirable woman made it &s;o much her whim&s;ical choice to give me. But, &s;ince it has thus fallen out; &s;ince &s;he was determined to leave the world; and &s;ince &s;he actually cea&s;es <HI>to be</HI>; ought I, who have &s;uch a &s;hare of life and health in hand, to indulge gloomy re|flections upon an event that is pa&s;&s;ed; and <HI>being</HI> pa&s;&s;ed, cannot be recalled?&mdash;Have I not had a &s;pecimen of what will be my ca&s;e, if I do?</P>
<P>For, Belford ('tis a folly to deny it) I have been, to u&s;e an old word, quite <HI>be&s;traught.</HI></P>
<P>Why, why, did my mother bring me up to bear no controul? Why was I &s;o educated, as that to my very tutors it was a reque&s;t, that I &s;hould not know what con|tradiction or di&s;appointment was?&mdash;Ought &s;he not to have known what cruelty there was in her kindne&s;s?</P>
<P>What a puni&s;hment, to have my fir&s;t very great di&s;ap|pointment touch my intellect!&mdash;And intellects once touched&mdash;But that I cannot bear to think of&mdash;Only thus far; The very repentance and amendment wi&s;hed me &s;o heartily by my kind and cro&s;s dear, have been invali|dated and po&s;tponed, who knows for how long? the <HI>amendment</HI> at lea&s;t:&mdash;Can a madman be capable of either?</P>
<P>Once touch'd therefore, I mu&s;t endeavour to bani&s;h tho&s;e gloomy reflections, which might <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> have brought on the right turn of mind; and this, to expre&s;s my&s;elf in Lord M.'s &s;tyle, that my wits may not be &s;ent a <HI>wooll-gathering.</HI></P>
<P>For, let me moreover own to thee, that Dr. Hale, who was my good <HI>A&s;tolfo</HI> [You read Ario&s;to, Jack] and has brought me back my <HI>wit-jar,</HI> had much ado, by &s;tarving diet, by profu&s;e phlebotomy, by flaying bli&s;ters, eylet-hole-cupping, a dark room, a midnight &s;olitude in a mid|day
<PB N="327" REF="330">
&s;un, to effect my recovery. And now, for my com|fort, he tells me, that I may &s;till have returns upon full moons&mdash;Horrible! mo&s;t horrible!&mdash;and mu&s;t be as care|ful of my&s;elf at both Equinoctials, as Cae&s;ar was warned to be of the ides of March.</P>
<P>How my heart &s;ickens at looking back upon what I was. Denied the Sun, and all comfort: <HI>All</HI> my vi&s;iters, low-born, tiptoe attendants: Even tho&s;e tiptoe &s;laves never approaching me but periodically, armed with gallipots, bolus's, and cephalic draughts; delivering their orders to me in hated whi&s;pers; and an&s;wering other cur|tain-holding impertinents, inquiring how I was, and how I took their execrable potions, whi&s;peringly too! What a cur&s;ed &s;till-life this!&mdash;Nothing active in me, or about me, but the worm that never dies.</P>
<P>Again I ha&s;ten from the recollection of &s;cenes, which <HI>will,</HI> at times, obtrude them&s;elves upon me.</P>
<P>Adieu, Belford!</P>
<P>But return me my la&s;t letter&mdash;and build nothing upon its contents. I <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> I <HI>will,</HI> I have <HI>already,</HI> overcome the&s;e fruitle&s;s gloomine&s;&s;es. Every hour my con&s;titution ri&s;es &s;tronger and &s;tronger to befriend me; and, except a tributary &s;igh now and then to the memory of my heart's beloved, it gives me hope, that I &s;hall quickly be what I was,&mdash;Life, &s;pirit, gaiety, and once more the plague of a Sex, that has been my plague, and will be every man's plague, at one time or other of his life.</P>
<P>I repeat my de&s;ire, however, that you will write to me as u&s;ual. I hope you have good &s;tore of particulars by you to communicate, when I can better bear to hear of the di&s;po&s;itions that were made for all that was mortal of my beloved Clari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>But it will be the joy of my heart to be told, that her implacable friends are plagued with remor&s;e. Such things as tho&s;e you may <HI>now</HI> &s;end me: For company in mi&s;ery is &s;ome relief; e&s;pecially when a man can think tho&s;e he hates as mi&s;erable as him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I Am preparing to leave this kingdom. Mowbray and Tourville promi&s;e to give me their company in a month or two.</P>
<P>I'll give thee my route.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t to Paris; and, for amu&s;ement and diver&s;ion &s;ake, try to renew &s;ome of my old friend&s;hips: Thence to &s;ome of the German courts: Thence, perhaps, to Vi|enna: Thence de&s;cend thro' Bavaria and the Tyrol to Venice, where I &s;hall keep the carnival: Thence to Flo|rence and Turin: Thence again over mount Cenis to France: And, when I return again to Paris, &s;hall expect to &s;ee my friend Belford, who by that time, I doubt not, will be all cru&s;ted and bearded over with penitence, &s;elf-denial, and mortification; a very anchorite, only an itine|rant one, journeying over in hope to cover a multitude of his own &s;ins, by pro&s;elyting his old companion.</P>
<P>But let me tell thee, Jack, if &s;tock ri&s;es on, as it has done &s;ince I wrote my la&s;t letter, I am afraid thou wilt find a difficult ta&s;k in &s;ucceeding, &s;hould &s;uch be thy purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor, I verily think, can thy own penitence and re|formation hold. Strong habits are not &s;o ea&s;ily rooted out. Old Satan has had too much benefit from thy faith|ful &s;ervices, for a &s;eries of years, to let thee &s;o ea&s;ily get out of his clutches, He knows what will do with thee. A fine &s;trapping Bona Roba, in the Chartres-ta&s;te, but well-limb'd, clear-complexion'd, and Turki&s;h-ey'd; thou the fir&s;t man with her, or made to believe &s;o, which is the &s;ame thing; how will thy fro&s;ty face &s;hine upon &s;uch an object! How will thy tri&s;tful vi&s;age be illumined by it! A compo&s;ition will be made between thee and the grand tempter: Thou wilt promi&s;e to do him &s;uit and &s;ervice till old age and inability come. And then will he, in all probability, be &s;ure of thee for ever. For, wert thou to outlive thy pre&s;ent reigning appetites, he will trump up &s;ome other darling &s;in, or make a now &s;econdary one darling, in order to keep thee firmly attached to his in|fernal intere&s;ts. Thou wilt continue re&s;olving to amend,
<PB N="329" REF="332">
but never amending, till grown old before thou art aware, (<HI>a dozen years after thou art old with every-body el&s;e</HI>) thy for-time-built tenement having la&s;ted its allotted period, he claps down upon thy grizzled head the univer&s;al trap-door: And then all will be over with thee in his own way.</P>
<P>Thou wilt think the&s;e hints uncharacteri&s;tic from me. But yet I cannot help warning thee of the danger thou art actually in; which is the greater, as thou &s;eeme&s;t not to know it. A few words more, therefore, on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t made good re&s;olutions. If thou keepe&s;t them not, thou wilt never be able to keep any. But, neverthe|le&s;s, the devil and thy time of life are again&s;t thee: And &s;ix to one thou faile&s;t. Were it only that thou ha&s;t <HI>re|&s;olved,</HI> &s;ix to one thou faile&s;t. And if thou do&s;t, thou wilt become the &s;coff of men, and the triumph of devils.&mdash;Then how will I laugh at thee! For this warning is not from principle. Perhaps I wi&s;h it were: But I never lyed to man, and hardly ever &s;aid truth to woman. The fir&s;t is what all free livers cannot &s;ay: The &s;econd, what every one can.</P>

<P>If this move thee not, I have news to acquaint thee with, of another di&s;mal cata&s;trophe that is but within this hour come to my ear, of another of thy ble&s;&s;ed agents.

<P>This his ca&s;e. He was at the head of a gang of &s;mugglers, endeavouring to carry off run goods, landed la&s;t Tue&s;day, when a party of dragoons came up with them in the evening. Some of his comrades fled. M^cDonald being &s;urrounded, attempted to fight his way thro', and wounded his man; but having received a &s;hot in his neck, and being cut deeply in the head by a broad-&s;word, he fell from his hor&s;e, was taken, and carried to Maid&s;tone-gaol: And there my informant left him, ju&s;t dying, and a&s;&s;ured of hanging if he recover.</P>

me, and, if in town, to the re&s;t of the confraternity, for &s;omething, not to <HI>&s;upport</HI> him was the word (for he ex|pected not to live till the fellow returned) but to bury him.</P>
<P>I never employed him but once; and then he ruined my project. I now thank Heaven that he did. But I &s;ent him three guineas; and promi&s;ed him more, as from you, and Mowbray, and Tourville, if he live a few days, or to take his tryal. And I put it upon you to make fur|ther inquiry of him, and to give him what you think fit.</P>
<P>His me&s;&s;enger tells me, That he is very penitent: That he weeps continually. He cries out, that he has been the vile&s;t of men: Yet palliates, that his nece&s;&s;ities made him wor&s;e than he &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been [An excu&s;e which none of <HI>us</HI> can plead]: But that what touched him mo&s;t of all, was a vile impo&s;ture he was put upon, to &s;erve a certain gentleman of fortune, to the ruin of the mo&s;t excellent woman that ever lived; and who, he had heard, was dead of grief.</P>

Change of &s;cene, and of climate, may e&s;tabli&s;h thy health: While this gro&s;s air, and the approach of winter, may thicken thy blood; and, with the help of a con&s;cience, that is upon the &s;truggle with thee, and like a cunning wre&s;tler watches its opportunity to give thee an|other fall, may make thee mi&s;erable for thy life.</P>
<P>I return your revoked letter. Don't de&s;troy it, how|ever. The &s;ame dialect may one day come in fa&s;hion with you again.</P>
<P>As to the family at Harlowe-Place, I have mo&s;t affect|ing letters from Colonel Morden relating to their grief and di&s;tre&s;s. You, to whom the occa&s;ion is owing, do well to rejoice in their compunction: But, as one well ob|&s;erves, <HI>Aver&s;e as they were to you, they mu&s;t and they would have been reconciled in time, had you done her ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;orry, if I could not &s;ay, that what you have warned me of in <HI>&s;port,</HI> makes me tremble in <HI>earne&s;t.</HI>
<PB N="332" REF="335">
I hope (for this is a &s;erious &s;ubject with me, tho' nothing can be &s;o with you) that I never &s;hall de&s;erve, by my apo&s;ta&s;y, to be the &s;coff of men, and the triumph of devils.</P>
<P>All that you &s;ay, of the difficulty of conquering rooted habits, is but too true. Tho&s;e, and time of life, are in|deed too much again&s;t me: But, when I reflect upon the ends (&s;ome untimely) of tho&s;e of our companions whom we have formerly lo&s;t; upon Belton's mi&s;erable exit; up|on the howls and &s;creams of Sinclair, which are &s;till in my ears; and now upon your mi&s;erable Tomlin&s;on; and compare their ends with the happy and de&s;irable end of the inimitable Mi&s;s Harlowe; I hope I have rea&s;on to think my footing morally &s;ecure. Your caution, never|thele&s;s, will be of u&s;e, however you might de&s;ign it: And &s;ince I know my weak &s;ide, I will endeavour to for|tify my&s;elf in that quarter by marriage, as &s;oon as I can make my&s;elf worthy of the confidence and e&s;teem of &s;ome virtuous woman; and, by this means, become the &s;ub|ject of your envy, rather than of your &s;coffs.</P>
<P>I have already begun my retributory purpo&s;es, as I may call them. I have &s;ettled an annual &s;um for life upon poor John Loftus, whom I di&s;abled, while he was endeavouring to protect his young mi&s;tre&s;s from my lawle&s;s attempts. I rejoice, that I &s;ucceeded not in that; as I do in recollect|ing many others of the like &s;ort, in which I mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>Poor Farley, who had become a bankrupt, I have &s;et up again: But have declared, that the annual allowance I make her &s;hall cea&s;e, if I hear &s;he returns to her former cour&s;es: And I have made her accountable for her con|duct to the good widow Lovick, whom I have taken, at a hand&s;ome &s;alary, for my hou&s;ekeeper at Edgeware (for I have let the hou&s;e at Watford); and &s;he is to di&s;pen&s;e the quarterly allotment to her, as &s;he merits.</P>
<P>This good woman &s;hall have other matters of the like nature under her care, as we grow better acquainted: And I make no doubt that &s;he will an&s;wer my expectations, and that I &s;hall be both confirmed and improved by her con|ver&s;ation: For &s;he &s;hall generally &s;it at my own table.</P>
<P>The unde&s;erved &s;ufferings of Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, her exalted merit, her exemplary preparation, and her happy end, will be &s;tanding &s;ubjects with us.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="336">She &s;hall read <HI>to</HI> me, when I have no company; write <HI>for</HI> me, out of books, pa&s;&s;ages &s;he &s;hall recommend. Her years (turn'd of fifty) and her good character, will &s;ecure me from &s;candal; and I have great plea&s;ure in reflecting, that I &s;hall be better my&s;elf for making her happy.</P>
<P>Then, whenever I am in danger, I will read &s;ome of the admirable lady's papers: Whenever I would abhor my former ways, I will read &s;ome of thine, and copies of my own.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of all this will be, that I &s;hall be the delight of my own relations of both &s;exes, who were wont to look upon me as a lo&s;t man. I &s;hall have good order in my own family, becau&s;e I &s;hall give the example my|&s;elf. I &s;hall be vi&s;ited and re&s;pected, not perhaps by Lovelace, by Mowbray, and by Tourville, becau&s;e they cannot &s;ee me upon the <HI>old</HI> terms, and will not, perhaps, &s;ee me upon the <HI>new,</HI> but by the be&s;t and worthie&s;t gentle|men, clergy as well as laity, all around me. I &s;hall look upon my pa&s;t follies with contempt; upon my old compa|nions with pity. Oaths and cur&s;es &s;hall be for ever bani&s;hed from my mouth: In their place &s;hall &s;ucceed conver&s;ation becoming a rational being, and a gentleman. And in|&s;tead of acts of <HI>offence,</HI> &s;ubjecting me perpetually to acts of <HI>defence,</HI> will I endeavour to atone for my pa&s;t evils, by doing all the good in my power, and by becoming an uni|ver&s;al benefactor to the extent of that power.</P>
<P>Now, tell me, Lovelace, upon this faint &s;ketch of what I hope to <HI>do,</HI> and to <HI>be,</HI> if this be not a &s;cheme infinitely preferable to the wild, the pernicious, the dangerous ones, both to body and &s;oul, which we have pur&s;ued?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could make my &s;ketch as amiable to you, as it appears to me. I wi&s;h it with all my &s;oul: For I always loved you. It has been my misfortune that I did: For this led me into infinite riots and follies, which otherwi&s;e, I verily think, I &s;hould not have been guilty of.</P>
<P>You have a great deal more to an&s;wer for, than I have, were it only in the temporal ruin of this admirable wo|man. Let me now, while yet you have youth, and health, and intellect, prevail upon you: For I am afraid, very much afraid, that &s;uch is the enormity of this &s;ingle wickedne&s;s, in depriving the world of &s;uch a &s;hining light,

that if you do not quickly reform, it will be out of your power to reform at all; and that Providence, which has already given you the fates of your agents Sinclair and Tomlin&s;on to take warning by, will not let the principal offender e&s;cape, if he &s;light the warning.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, laugh at me for the&s;e &s;erious reflec|tions. Do, if you will. I had rather you &s;hould laugh at me for continuing in this way of thinking and acting, than triumph over me, as you threaten, on my &s;werving from purpo&s;es I have determined upon with &s;uch good rea&s;on, and from &s;uch good examples.</P>
<P>And &s;o much for this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know when you intend to &s;et out. I have too much concern for your welfare, not to wi&s;h you in a thinner air, and more certain climate.</P>
<P>What have Tourville and Mowbray to do, that they cannot &s;et out with you? They will not cove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my company, I dare &s;ay; and I &s;hall not be able to en|dure theirs, when you are gone: Take them therefore with you.</P>
<P>I will not, however, for&s;wear making you a vi&s;it at Paris, at your return from Germany and Italy: But hardly with the hope of reclaiming you, if due reflection upon what I have &s;et before you, and upon what you have written in your two la&s;t, will not by that time have done it.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall &s;ee you before you go. Once more, I wi&s;h you were gone. This heavy i&s;land-air cannot do for you what that of the continent will.</P>
<P>I do not think I ought to communicate with you, as I u&s;ed to do, on this &s;ide the Channel: Let me then hear from you on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, and you &s;hall command the pen, as you plea&s;e; and, hone&s;tly, the power, of</P>

<P>FATE, I believe in my con&s;cience, &s;pins threads for tragedies, on purpo&s;e for thee to weave with&mdash;Thy Watford uncle, poor Bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, the fair Inimitable (Exalted

creature! and is &s;he to be found in &s;uch a li&s;t!) the ac|cur&s;ed woman, and Tomlin&s;on, &s;eem to have been all doomed to give thee a theme for the Di&s;mal and the Hor|rible!&mdash;And, by my &s;oul, as Lord M. would phra&s;e it, <HI>thou do&s;t work it going.</HI></P>
<P>That's the horrid thing: A man cannot begin to <HI>think,</HI> but <HI>cau&s;es</HI> for thought croud in upon him: The gloomy takes place; and mirth and gaiety abandon his heart for ever!</P>
<P>Poor M^cDonald!&mdash;I am really &s;orry for the fel|low.&mdash;He was an u&s;eful, faithful, &s;olemn varlet, who could act incomparably any part given him, and knew not what a blu&s;h was.&mdash;He really took hone&s;t pains for me in the la&s;t affair; which has co&s;t him and me &s;o dearly in reflection. Often gravell'd, as we both were, yet was he never daunted.&mdash;Poor M^cDonald, I mu&s;t once more &s;ay!&mdash;For carrying on a &s;olemn piece of roguery, he had no equal.</P>
<P>I was &s;o &s;olicitous to know if he were really as bad as thou ha&s;t a knack of painting every-body whom thou &s;ingle&s;t out to exerci&s;e thy murdering pen upon, that I di&s;patched a man and hor&s;e to Maid&s;tone, as &s;oon as I had thine; and had word brought me, that he died in two hours after he had received thy three guineas. And all thou wrote&s;t of his concern in relation to the ever-dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, it &s;eems, was true.</P>
<P>I can't help it, Belford!&mdash;I have only to add, that it is happy that the poor fellow lived not to be hanged; as it &s;eems he would have been: For who knows, as he had got into &s;uch a penitential &s;train, what might have been in his dying &s;peech?</P>
<P>When a man has not <HI>great</HI> good to comfort him&s;elf with, it is right to make the be&s;t of the <HI>little</HI> that may of|fer. There never was any di&s;comfort happened to mortal man, but &s;ome little ray of con&s;olation would dart in, if the wretch was not &s;o much a wretch, as to <HI>draw,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>undraw,</HI> the curtain, to keep it out.</P>
<P>And &s;o much, at this time, and for ever, for poor Capt. Tomlin&s;on, as I called him.</P>
<P>Your &s;olicitude to get me out of this heavy changeable climate, exactly tallies with every-body's here. They all
<PB N="336" REF="339">
believe, that travelling will e&s;tabli&s;h me. Yet I think I am quite well. Only the&s;e plaguy <HI>new's</HI> and <HI>full's,</HI> and the <HI>equinoctials,</HI> fright me a little when I think of them; and that is always: For the whole family are continually ringing the&s;e changes in my ears, and are more &s;edulou&s;ly intent, than I can well account for, to get me out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>But wilt thou write often, when I am gone? Wilt thou then piece the thread where thou broke&s;t it off? Wilt thou give me the particulars of <HI>their</HI> di&s;tre&s;s, who were my <HI>auxiliaries</HI> in bringing on the event that affects me?&mdash;Nay, <HI>principals</HI> rather: Since, &s;ay what thou wilt, what did I do worth a woman's breaking her heart for?</P>
<P>Faith and troth, Jack, I have had very hard u&s;age, as I have often &s;aid:&mdash;To have &s;uch a plaguy ill name given me, pointed at, &s;creamed out upon, run away from, as a mad dog would be; all my own friends ready to renounce me!&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet I think I de&s;erve it all: For have I not been as ready to give up my&s;elf, as others are to condemn me?</P>
<P>What madne&s;s, what folly, this!&mdash;Who will take the part of a man that condemns him&s;elf?&mdash;Who can? He that pleads guilty to an indictment, leaves no room for ought but the &s;entence. Out upon me, for an impolitic wretch! I have not the art of the lea&s;t artful of any of our Chri&s;tian princes; who every day are guilty of ten times wor&s;e breaches of faith; and yet, i&s;&s;uing out a manife&s;to, they wipe their mouths, and go on from in|fraction to infraction, from robbery to robbery; commit deva&s;tation upon deva&s;tation; and de&s;troy&mdash;for their <HI>glory!</HI> And are rewarded with the names of <HI>Conquerors,</HI> and are dubb'd <HI>Le Grand</HI>; prai&s;ed, and even deified, by orators and poets, for their butcheries and depredations.</P>
<P>While I, a poor, &s;ingle, harmle&s;s prowler; at lea&s;t <HI>com|paratively</HI> harmle&s;s; in order to &s;atisfy my hunger, &s;teal but one poor lamb; and every mouth is opened, every hand is lifted up, again&s;t me.</P>
<P>Nay, as I have ju&s;t now heard. I am to be <HI>manife&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d</HI> again&s;t, tho' no prince: For Mi&s;s Howe threatens to have the ca&s;e publi&s;hed to the whole world.</P>
<P>I have a good mind not to oppo&s;e it; and to write an
<PB N="337" REF="340">
an&s;wer to it, as &s;oon as it comes forth, and exculpate my|&s;elf, by throwing all the fault upon the old ones. And this I have to plead, &s;uppo&s;ing all that my wor&s;t enemies can allege again&s;t me were true,&mdash;That I am not an&s;werable for all the extravagant and unfore&s;een con&s;equences that this affair has been attended with.</P>
<P>And this I will prove demon&s;trably by a ca&s;e, which, but a few hours ago, I put to Lord M. and to the two Mi&s;&s;es Montague. This it is:
<Q><P>Suppo&s;e <HI>A,</HI> a mi&s;er, had hid a parcel of gold in a <HI>&s;e|cret place,</HI> in order to keep it there, till he could lend it out at extravagant intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e <HI>B</HI> in &s;uch great want of this trea&s;ure, as to be unable to <HI>live without it.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;e <HI>A,</HI> the <HI>mi&s;er,</HI> has &s;uch an opinion of <HI>B,</HI> the <HI>wanter,</HI> that he would rather lend it to him, than to any mortal living; but yet, tho' he has <HI>no other</HI> u&s;e in the world for it, in&s;i&s;ts upon very uncon|&s;cionable terms.</P>
<P><HI>B</HI> would gladly pay <HI>common</HI> intere&s;t for it; but would be undone (in <HI>his own</HI> opinion, at lea&s;t, and that is every-thing to him) if he complied with the mi&s;er's terms; &s;ince he would be &s;ure to be &s;oon thrown in|to <HI>gaol</HI> for the debt, and made a <HI>pri&s;oner for life.</HI> Wherefore gue&s;&s;ing (being an arch, penetrating fel|low) where the <HI>&s;weet hoard</HI> lies, he <HI>&s;earches</HI> for it, when the mi&s;er is in a <HI>profound &s;leep,</HI> finds it, and runs away with it.</P>
<P><HI>B,</HI> in this ca&s;e, can be only a <HI>thief,</HI> that's plain, Jack.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here Mi&s;s Montague put in very &s;martly.&mdash;A thief, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that &s;teals what is and ought to be dearer to me than my life, de&s;erves le&s;s to be forgiven, than he who murders me.</P>
<P>But what is this, cou&s;in Charlotte, &s;aid I, that is dearer to you, than your life? Your <HI>honour,</HI> you'll &s;ay&mdash;I will not talk to a lady (I never did) in a way &s;he cannot an|&s;wer me&mdash;But in the in&s;tance for which I put my ca&s;e (allowing all you attribute to the phantom) what honour is lo&s;t, where the <HI>will</HI> is not violated, and the per&s;on can|not help it? But, with re&s;pect to the ca&s;e put, how knew
<PB N="338" REF="341">
we, till the theft <HI>was committed,</HI> that the mi&s;er did actu|ally &s;et &s;o romantic a value upon the trea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Both my cou&s;ins were &s;ilent; and my Lord cur&s;ed me, becau&s;e he could not an&s;wer me; and I proceeded.</P>
<P>Well then, the re&s;ult is, that <HI>B</HI> can only be a thief; that's plain&mdash;To pur&s;ue, therefore, my ca&s;e&mdash;
<Q><P>Suppo&s;e this &s;ame mi&s;erly <HI>A,</HI> on awaking, and &s;earch|ing for, and finding his trea&s;ure gone, takes it &s;o much to heart, that he &s;tarves him&s;elf;</P>
<P>Who but him&s;elf is to blame for that?&mdash;Would either Equity, Law, or Con&s;cience, hang <HI>B</HI> for a murder?</P></Q></P>
<P>And now to apply, &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>None of your applications, cried my cou&s;ins, both in a breath.</P>
<P>None of your applications, and be d&mdash;n'd to you, the pa&s;&s;ionate Peer.</P>
<P>Well then, returned I, I am to conclude it to be a ca&s;e &s;o plain, that it needs none; looking at the two girls, who tried for a blu&s;h apiece. And I hold my&s;elf, of con&s;e|quence, acquitted of the <HI>death.</HI></P>
<P>Not &s;o, cried my Lord [Peers are judges, thou knowe&s;t, Jack, in the la&s;t re&s;ort]: For if, by committing an un|lawful act, a capital crime is the con&s;equence, you are an&s;werable for both.</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, my good Lord?&mdash;But will you take upon you to &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing (as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e) a Rape (&s;aving your pre&s;ence, cou&s;in Charlotte, &s;aving your pre&s;ence, cou&s;in Patty); Is death the <HI>natural</HI> con&s;equence of a Rape?&mdash;Did you ever hear, my Lord, or did you, Ladies, that it was?&mdash;And if not the <HI>natural</HI> con&s;equence, and a lady will de&s;troy her&s;elf, whether by a lingering death, as of grief; or by the dagger, as Lucretia did; Is there more than one fault the <HI>man</HI>'s?&mdash;Is not the other <HI>her</HI>'s?&mdash;Were it not &s;o, let me tell you, my dears, chucking each of my blu&s;hing cou&s;ins under the chin, we either have had no men &s;o wicked as young Tarquin was, or no women &s;o virtuous as Lucretia, in the &s;pace of&mdash;How many thou|&s;and years, my Lord?&mdash;And &s;o Lucretia is recorded as a &s;ingle wonder!</P>
<P>You may believe I was cry'd out upon. People who
<PB N="339" REF="342">
cannot an&s;wer, will rave: And this they all did. But I in&s;i&s;ted upon it to them, and &s;o I do to you, Jack, that I ought to be acquitted of every-thing but a common theft, a private larceny, as the lawyers call it, in this point. And were my life to be a forfeit to the Law, it would not be for murder.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as I told them, there was a circum&s;tance &s;trong|ly in my favour in this ca&s;e: For I would have been glad, with all my &s;oul, to have purcha&s;ed my forgivene&s;s by a compliance with the terms I fir&s;t boggled at. And this I offered; and my Lord, and Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, and my two cou&s;ins, and all my cou&s;ins cou&s;ins, to the fourteenth generation, would have been bound for me&mdash;But it would not do: The &s;weet mi&s;er would break her heart, and die; and how could I help it?</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Jack, had not the lady died, would there have been half &s;o much &s;aid of it, as there is? Was I the cau&s;e of her death? or, Could I help it? And have there not been, in a million of ca&s;es like this, nine hun|dred and ninety-nine thou&s;and that have not ended as this has ended?&mdash;How hard, then, is my fate!&mdash;Upon my &s;oul, I won't bear it as I have done; but, in&s;tead of take|ing guilt to my&s;elf, claim pity. And this (&s;ince ye&s;terday cannot be recalled) is the only cour&s;e I can pur&s;ue to make my&s;elf ea&s;y. Proceed anon.</P>

<P>BUT what a pretty &s;cheme of life ha&s;t thou drawn out for thy&s;elf, and thy old widow! By my &s;oul, Jack, I am mightily taken with it. There is but one thing wanting in it; and that will come of cour&s;e: Only to be in the commi&s;&s;ion, and one of the quorum. Thou art al|ready provided with a clerk, as good as thou'lt want; for thou under&s;tande&s;t Law, and &s;he Con&s;cience: A good Lord Chancellor between ye!&mdash;I &s;hould take prodi|gious plea&s;ure to hear thee decide in a ba&s;tard ca&s;e, upon thy new notions, and old remembrances.</P>
<P>But raillery apart [All gloom at heart, by Jupiter! al|tho' the pen and the countenance a&s;&s;ume airs of levity!]:
<PB N="340" REF="343">
If, after all, thou can&s;t &s;o ea&s;ily repent and reform, as thou thinke&s;t thou can&s;t: If thou can&s;t thus &s;hake off thy old &s;ins, and thy old habits: And if thy old ma&s;ter will &s;o readily di&s;mi&s;s &s;o tried and &s;o faithful a &s;ervant, and permit thee thus calmly to enjoy thy new &s;y&s;tem; no room for &s;candal; all temptation cea&s;ing: And if at la&s;t (thy reformation warranted and approved by time) thou mar|rie&s;t, and live&s;t hone&s;t:&mdash;Why, Belford, I cannot but &s;ay, that if all the&s;e IF's come to pa&s;s, thou &s;tande&s;t a good chance to be a happy man!</P>
<P>All I think, as I told thee in my la&s;t, is, that the devil knows his own intere&s;t too well, to let thee off &s;o ea&s;ily. Thou thy&s;elf telle&s;t me, that we cannot repent when we will. And indeed I found it &s;o: For, in my lucid inter|vals, I made good re&s;olutions: But, as health turned its blyth &s;ide to me, and opened my pro&s;pects of recovery, all my old inclinations and appetites returned; and this letter, perhaps, will be a thorough conviction to thee, that I <HI>am</HI> as wild a fellow as ever, or in the way to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Thou a&s;ke&s;t me, very &s;eriou&s;ly, If, upon the faint &s;ketch thou ha&s;t drawn, thy new &s;cheme be not infinitely prefer|able to any of tho&s;e which we have &s;o long pur&s;ued?&mdash;Why, Jack&mdash;Let me reflect&mdash;Why, Belford&mdash;I can't &s;ay but it is. It is really, as Biddy in the play &s;ays, a good comfortable &s;cheme.</P>
<P>But when thou telle&s;t me, That it was thy misfortune to love me, becau&s;e thy value for me made thee a wickeder man than otherwi&s;e thou would&s;t have been; I de&s;ire thee to revolve this a&s;&s;ertion: And I am per&s;uaded, that thou wilt not find thy&s;elf in &s;o right a train as thou imagine&s;t.</P>
<P>No fal&s;e colourings, no glo&s;&s;es, does a true penitent aim at. Deba&s;ement, diffidence, mortification, contrition, are all near of kin, Jack, and in&s;eparable from a repentant &s;pirit.&mdash;If thou knowe&s;t not this, thou art not got three &s;teps (out of three&s;core) towards repentance and amend|ment. And let me remind thee, before the grand accu&s;er comes to do it, that thou wert ever above being a pa&s;&s;ive follower in iniquity. Tho' thou had&s;t not &s;o good an in|vention as he to whom thou write&s;t, thou had&s;t as act|ive an heart for mi&s;chief, as ever I met with in man.</P>
<P>Then for improving an hint, thou wert always a true

<P>What indeed made me appear to be more wicked than thee, was, that I being a hand&s;ome fellow, and thou an ugly one, when we had &s;tarted a game, and hunted it down, the poor frighted pu&s;s generally cho&s;e to throw her&s;elf into my paws, rather than into thine: And then, di&s;appointed, ha&s;t thou wiped thy blubber-lips, and march|ed off to &s;tart a new game, calling me a wicked fellow all the while.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Belford, thou wert an excellent <HI>&s;tarter</HI> and <HI>&s;etter.</HI> The old women were not afraid for their daugh|ters, when they &s;aw &s;uch a face as thine. But, when <HI>I</HI> came, whip, was the key turned upon their girls. And yet all &s;ignified nothing; for Love, upon occa&s;ion, will draw an elephant thro' a key-hole. But for thy HEART, Belford, who ever doubted <HI>that</HI>?</P>
<P>Nor even in this affair, that &s;ticks mo&s;t upon me, and which my con&s;cience makes &s;uch a handle of again&s;t me, art thou &s;o innocent as thou fan&s;ie&s;t thy&s;elf. Thou wilt &s;tare at this: But it is true; and I will convince thee of it in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Thou &s;ay&s;t, thou would&s;t have &s;aved the lady from the ruin &s;he met with. Thou art a pretty fellow for this: For <HI>how</HI> would&s;t thou have &s;aved her? What methods did&s;t thou <HI>take</HI> to &s;ave her?</P>
<P>Thou knewe&s;t my de&s;igns all along. Had&s;t thou a mind to make thy&s;elf a good title to the merit to which thou now pretende&s;t to lay claim, thou &s;houlde&s;t, like a true knight-errant, have &s;ought to &s;et the lady free from her inchanted ca&s;tle. Thou &s;hould&s;t have appri&s;ed her of her danger; have &s;tolen in, when the giant was out of the way; or, had&s;t thou the true &s;pirit of chivalry upon thee, and nothing el&s;e would have done, have killed the giant; and then &s;omething would&s;t thou have had to brag of.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'O but the giant was my friend: He repo&s;ed a confi|dence in me: And I &s;hould have betrayed my friend, and his confidence!'</Q>
This thou would&s;t have pleaded, no doubt. But try this plea upon thy pre&s;ent principles,
<PB N="342" REF="345">
and thou wilt &s;ee what a caitiff thou wert to let it have weight with thee, upon an occa&s;ion where a breach of con|fidence is more excu&s;eable than to keep the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Thou can&s;t not pretend, and I know thou wilt not, that thou wert afraid of thy life by taking &s;uch a mea&s;ure: For a braver fellow lives not, nor a more fearle&s;s, than Jack Belford. I remember &s;everal in&s;tances, and thou can&s;t not forget them, where thou ha&s;t ventured thy bones, thy neck, thy life, again&s;t numbers, in a cau&s;e of roguery; and had&s;t thou had a &s;park of that virtue, which now thou art willing to flatter thy&s;elf thou ha&s;t, thou would&s;t &s;urely have run a ri&s;k to &s;ave an innocence, and a virtue, that it became every man to protect and e&s;pou&s;e. This is the truth of the ca&s;e, greatly as it makes again&s;t my&s;elf. But I hate an hypocrite from my &s;oul.</P>
<P>I believe I &s;hould have killed thee at the <HI>time,</HI> if I could, had&s;t thou betrayed me thus. But I am &s;ure <HI>now,</HI> that I would have thanked thee for it, with all my heart; and thought thee more a father, and a friend, than my real father, and my be&s;t friend&mdash;And it was natural for thee to think, with &s;o exalted a merit as this lady had, that this would have been the ca&s;e, when con&s;ideration took place of pa&s;&s;ion; or, rather, when that damn'd fondne&s;s for in|trigue cea&s;ed, which never was my pride &s;o much, as it is now, upon reflection, my cur&s;e.</P>
<P>Set about defending thy&s;elf, and I will probe thee &s;till deeper, and convict thee &s;till more effectually, that thou ha&s;t more guilt than merit even in this affair. And as to all the others, in which we have hunted in couples, thou wert always the forwarde&s;t whelp, and more ready, by far, to run away with me, than I with thee. Yet can&s;t thou now compo&s;e thy hor&s;e-mu&s;cles, and cry out, How much more ha&s;t thou, Lovelace, to an&s;wer for, than I have!&mdash;Saying <HI>nothing,</HI> neither, when thou &s;ay&s;t this, were it <HI>true:</HI>&mdash;For thou wilt not be tried, when the time comes, by <HI>compari&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, thou may&s;t, at this rate, &s;o mi&s;erably deceive thy&s;elf, that, notwith&s;tanding all thy &s;elf-denial and mor|tification, when thou clo&s;e&s;t thy eyes, thou may&s;t perhaps open them in a place where thou thoughte&s;t lea&s;t to be.</P>
<P>However, con&s;ult thy old woman on this &s;ubject. I

&s;hall be thought to be out of character, if I go on in this &s;train. But really, as to a title to merit in this affair, I do a&s;&s;ure thee, Jack, that thou le&s;s de&s;erve&s;t prai&s;e than an hor&s;e-pond: And I wi&s;h I had the &s;ou&s;ing of thee.</P>
<P>I AM actually now employed in taking leave of my friends in the country. I had once thoughts of taking Tomlin&s;on, as I called him, with me: But his de&s;tiny has fru&s;trated that intention.</P>
<P>Next Monday I think to &s;ee you in town; and then you, and I, and Mowbray, and Tourville, will laugh off that evening together. They will both accompany me (as I expect <HI>you</HI> will) to Dover, if not cro&s;s the water. I mu&s;t leave you and them good friends. They take ex|tremely ami&s;s the treatment you have given them in your la&s;t letters. They &s;ay, you &s;trike at their under&s;tandings. I laugh at them; and tell them, that tho&s;e people who have <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> are the mo&s;t apt to be angry when it is called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Make up all the papers and narratives you can &s;pare me again&s;t the time. The Will particularly I expect to take with me. Who knows but that tho&s;e things, which will help to &s;ecure <HI>you</HI> in the way you are got into, may convert <HI>me?</HI></P>
<P>Thou talke&s;t of a wife, Jack: What thinke&s;t thou of our Charlotte? Her family and fortune, I doubt, accord|ing to thy &s;cheme, are a little too high. Will tho&s;e be an objection? Charlotte is a &s;mart girl. For piety (thy pre&s;ent turn) I cannot &s;ay much: Yet &s;he is as &s;erious as mo&s;t of her Sex, at her time of life&mdash;Would flaunt it a little, I believe too, like the re&s;t of them, were her repu|tation under covert.</P>
<P>But it won't do neither, now I think of it:&mdash;Thou art &s;o homely, and &s;o aukward a creature! Ha&s;t &s;uch a boat-&s;wain like air!&mdash;People would think &s;he had picked thee up in Wapping, or Rotherhith; or in going to &s;ee &s;ome new &s;hip launched, or to view the docks at Chatham, or Port&s;mouth. So gaudy and &s;o clum&s;y! Thy tawdrine&s;s won't do with Charlotte!&mdash;So &s;it thee down contented, Belford.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="347">Yet would I fain &s;ecure thy morals too, if matrimony will do it.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ee!&mdash;Now I have it.</P>
<P>Has not the widow Lovick a daughter, or a niece? It is not every girl of <HI>fortune</HI> and <HI>family</HI> that will go to prayers with thee <HI>once or twice a day.</HI> But &s;ince thou art for take|ing a wife to mortify with, what if thou marrie&s;t the wi|dow her&s;elf?&mdash;She will then have a double concern in thy conver&s;ion. You and &s;he may <HI>t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</HI> pa&s;s many a comfortable winter's evening together, comparing <HI>expe|riences,</HI> as the good folks call them.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day, Sept.</HI> 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>GIVE me leave, dear Sir, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you in a very &s;erious and &s;olemn manner on a &s;ubject that I mu&s;t not, cannot di&s;pen&s;e with; as I promi&s;ed the divine lady, that I would do every-thing in my power to prevent that further mi&s;chief which &s;he was &s;o very appre|hen&s;ive of.</P>
<P>I will not content my&s;elf with di&s;tant hints. It is with very great concern that I have ju&s;t now heard of a declaration which you are &s;aid to have made to your rela|tions at Harlowe-Place, That you will not re&s;t till you have avenged your cou&s;in's wrongs upon Mr. Lovelace.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to offer to defend the unhappy man, or even <HI>unduly</HI> to extenuate his crime: But yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, that the family, by their per&s;ecutions of the dear lady at fir&s;t, and by their implacablene&s;s afterwards, ought, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> to <HI>&s;hare</HI> the blame with him. There is even great rea&s;on to believe, that a lady of &s;uch a religious turn, her virtue neither to be &s;urpri&s;ed nor corrupted, her will in|violate, would have got over a <HI>mere per&s;onal</HI> injury; e&s;pe|cially as he would have done all that was in his power to repair it; and as, from the application of all his family in his favour, and other circum&s;tances attending his &s;incere
<PB N="345" REF="348">
and voluntary offer, the lady might have conde&s;cended, with greater glory to her&s;elf, than if he had never offended.</P>
<P>When I have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you next, I will acquaint you, Sir, with all the circum&s;tances of this me|lancholy &s;tory; from which you will &s;ee, that Mr. Love|lace was extremely ill-treated, at fir&s;t, by the whole fa|mily, this admirable lady excepted. This exception, I know, heightens his crime: But as his principal intention was but to try her virtue; and that he became &s;o earne&s;t a &s;uppliant to her for marriage; and as he has &s;uffered &s;o deplorably in the lo&s;s of his rea&s;on, for not having it in his power to repair her wrongs; I pre&s;ume to hope, that much is to be pleaded again&s;t &s;uch a re&s;olution as you are &s;aid to have made.</P>
<P>I will read to you at the &s;ame time &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages from letters of his; two of which (one but this moment re|ceived) will convince you, that the unhappy man, who is but now recovering his intellects, needs no greater pu|ni&s;hment than what he has from his own reflections.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now read over the <HI>copies</HI> of the dear lady's po&s;thumous letters. I &s;end them all to you, except that directed for Mr. Lovelace; which I re&s;erve till I have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you. Let me intreat you to read once more <HI>that</HI> to your&s;elf; and <HI>that</HI> to her brother <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See p. 235.</NOTE>; which latter I now &s;end you; as they are in point to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I think, Sir, they are unan&s;werable. Such, at lea&s;t, is the effect they have upon me, that I hope I &s;hall never be provoked to draw my &s;word again in a private quarrel.</P>
<P>To the weight the&s;e mu&s;t needs have upon you, let me add, that the unhappy man has given no <HI>new</HI> occa&s;ion of offence, &s;ince your vi&s;it to him at Lord M's, when you were &s;o well &s;atisfied of his intention to repair his crimes, that you your&s;elf urged to your dear cou&s;in <HI>her</HI> forgive|ne&s;s of him.</P>
<P>Let me <HI>al&s;o</HI> (tho' I pre&s;ume to hope there is no need, when you coolly con&s;ider every-thing) remind you of your own promi&s;e to your departing cou&s;in; relying upon which, her la&s;t moments were the ea&s;ier.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="349">My dear colonel Morden, the highe&s;t injury was to <HI>her:</HI> Her family all have a &s;hare in the <HI>cau&s;e: She</HI> forgives it: Why &s;hould we not endeavour to imitate what we admire?</P>
<P>You a&s;ked me, Sir, when in town, If a brave man could be a premeditatedly ba&s;e one?&mdash;Generally &s;peaking, I be|lieve Bravery and Ba&s;ene&s;s are incompatible. But Mr. Lovelace's character, in the in&s;tance before us, affords a proof of the truth of the common ob&s;ervation, That there is no general rule but has its exceptions: For England, I believe, as gallant a nation as it is deemed to be, has not in it a braver &s;pirit than his; nor a man who has greater &s;kill at his weapons; nor more <HI>calmne&s;s</HI> with his &s;kill.</P>
<P>I mention not this with a thought that it can affect Col. Morden; who, if he be not with-held by SUPERIOR MO|TIVES, as well as influenced by tho&s;e I have reminded him of, will tell me, That this &s;kill, and this bravery, will make him the more worthy of being called upon by him.</P>
<P>To the&s;e SUPERIOR motives then I refer my&s;elf: And with the greater confidence; as a pur&s;uit ending in blood would not, at <HI>this time,</HI> have the plea lie for it with <HI>any|body,</HI> which &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion might have with <HI>&s;ome:</HI> But would be con&s;trued by <HI>all,</HI> to be a cool and deliberate act of revenge for an evil ab&s;olutely irretrievable: An act, which a brave and noble &s;pirit, &s;uch as the gentleman's to whom I now write, is not capable of.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir, for the &s;ake of my executorial duty and promi&s;e, keeping in eye the dear lady's <HI>per&s;onal injunctions,</HI> as well as <HI>written will,</HI> inforced by <HI>letters po&s;thumous.</HI> Every article of which (&s;olicitous as we <HI>both</HI> are to &s;ee it duly performed) &s;he would have di&s;pen&s;ed with, rather than farther mi&s;chief &s;hould happen on her account.

<HEAD>LETTER XCIV. Super&s;cribed, To my beloved Cou&s;in <HI>WILLIAM MORDEN,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> To be delivered after my death.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it is uncertain, from my pre&s;ent weak &s;tate, whe|ther, if living, I may be in a condition to receive as I ought the favour you intend me of a vi&s;it, when you come to London, I take this opportunity to return you, while able, the humble acknowlegements of a grateful heart, for all your goodne&s;s to me from childhood till now: And more particularly for your pre&s;ent kind inter|po&s;ition in my favour&mdash;God Almighty for ever ble&s;s you, dear Sir, for the kindne&s;s you endeavoured to procure for me.</P>
<P>One principal end of my writing to you in this &s;olemn manner, is, to beg of you, which I do with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, that when you come to hear the particulars of my &s;tory, you will not &s;uffer <HI>active</HI> re&s;entment to take place in your generous brea&s;t on my account.</P>
<P>Remember, my dear cou&s;in, that vengeance is God's province; and he has undertaken to repay it; nor will you, I hope, invade that province:&mdash;E&s;pecially as there is no nece&s;&s;ity for you to attempt to vindicate my fame; &s;ince the offender him&s;elf (before he is called upon) has &s;tood forth, and offered to do me all the ju&s;tice that you could have extorted from him, had I lived: And when your own per&s;on may be endangered by running an <HI>equal</HI> ri&s;que with a <HI>guilty man.</HI></P>
<P>Duelling, Sir, I need not tell <HI>you,</HI> who have adorned a public character, is not only an u&s;urpation of the Divine prerogative; but it is an in&s;ult upon magi&s;tracy and good government. 'Tis an impious act. 'Tis an attempt to take away a life that ought not to depend upon a private &s;word: An act, the con&s;equence of which is to hurry a &s;oul (all its &s;ins upon its head) into perdition; endan|gering that of the poor triumpher&mdash;Since neither intend to give to the other that <HI>chance,</HI> as I may call it, for the
<PB N="348" REF="351">
Divine mercy, in an opportunity for repentance, which each pre&s;umes to hope for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Seek not then, I be&s;eech you, Sir, to aggravate my fault, by a pur&s;uit of blood, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be deemed a con&s;equence of it. Give not the unhappy man the merit (were you a&s;&s;uredly to be the victor) of falling by your hand. At pre&s;ent he is the perfidious, the in|grateful deceiver; but will not the forfeiture of his life, and the probable lo&s;s of his &s;oul, be a dreadful expia|tion for having made me mi&s;erable for <HI>a few months</HI> only, and thro' that mi&s;ery, by the Divine favour, happy to all Eternity?</P>
<P>In &s;uch a ca&s;e, my cou&s;in, where &s;hall the evil &s;top? And who &s;hall avenge on you?&mdash;And who on your aven|ger?</P>
<P>Let the poor man's con&s;cience then, dear Sir, avenge me. He will one day find puni&s;hment more than enough from that. Leave him to the chance of repentance. If the Almighty will give him time for it, why &s;hould you deny it him?&mdash;Let him &s;till be the guilty aggre&s;&s;or; and let no one &s;ay, Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe is now amply revenged in his fall; or, in the ca&s;e of yours (which Heaven avert!) that her fault, in&s;tead of being buried in her grave, is per|petuated, and aggravated, by a lo&s;s far greater than that of her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Often, Sir, has the <HI>more</HI> guilty been the vanqui&s;her of the <HI>le&s;s.</HI> An Earl of Shrew&s;bury, in the reign of Charles II. as I have read, endeavouring to revenge the greate&s;t injury that man can do to man, met with his death at Barn-Elms, from the hand of the ignoble Duke who had vilely di&s;honoured him. Nor can it be thought an unequal di&s;|pen&s;ation, were it <HI>generally</HI> to happen, that the u&s;urper of the Divine prerogative &s;hould be puni&s;hed for his pre|&s;umption by the man whom he &s;ought to de&s;troy, and who, however <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> criminal, is put, in this ca&s;e, up|on a nece&s;&s;ary act of &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>May Heaven protect you, Sir, in all your ways; and, once more I pray, reward you for all your kindne&s;s to me: A kindne&s;s &s;o worthy of <HI>your</HI> heart, and &s;o exceed|ingly grateful to <HI>mine:</HI> That of &s;eeking to make peace, and to reconcile parents to a once beloved child; uncles
<PB N="349" REF="352">
to a niece late their favourite; and a brother and &s;i&s;ter to a &s;i&s;ter whom once they thought not unworthy of that ten|der relation. A kindne&s;s &s;o greatly preferable to the ven|geance of the murdering &s;word.</P>
<P>Be a comforter, dear Sir, to my honoured parents, as you have been to me: And may we, thro' the Divine goodne&s;s to us both, meet in that ble&s;&s;ed Eternity, into which, as I humbly tru&s;t, I &s;hall have entered when you read This.</P>
<P>So prays, and to her late&s;t hour will pray, my dear cou&s;in Morden, my Friend, my Guardian, but not my Avenger&mdash;[Dear Sir! remember That!]&mdash;</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very &s;orry, that any-thing you have heard I have &s;aid &s;hould give you unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am obliged to you for the letters you have communi|cated to me; and &s;till further for your promi&s;e to favour me with others occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>All that relates to my dear cou&s;in I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee, be it from whom it will.</P>
<P>I leave to your own di&s;cretion, what may or may not be proper for Mi&s;s Howe to &s;ee from &s;o free a pen as mine.</P>
<P>I admire her &s;pirit. Were &s;he a <HI>man,</HI> do you think, Sir, <HI>&s;he</HI> would, at <HI>this time,</HI> have your advice to take upon &s;uch a &s;ubject as that you write upon?</P>
<P>Fear not, however, that your communications &s;hall put me upon any mea&s;ures that otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have taken. The wickedne&s;s, Sir, is of &s;uch a nature, as admits not of aggravation.</P>
<P>Yet I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I have not made any re&s;olu|tions that will be a tie upon me.</P>
<P>I have indeed expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf with vehemence upon the occa&s;ion. Who could forbear to do &s;o? But it is not my way to re&s;olve in matters of moment, till opportu|nity brings the execution of my purpo&s;es within my reach.
<PB N="350" REF="353">
We &s;hall &s;ee what manner of &s;pirit this young man will be acted by, on his recovery. If he continue to brave and defy a family, which he has &s;o irreparably injured&mdash;If&mdash;But re&s;olutions depending upon future contingencies are be&s;t left to future determination, as I ju&s;t now hinted.</P>
<P>Mean time, I will own, that I think my cou&s;in's argu|ments unan&s;werable. No <HI>good</HI> man but mu&s;t be concluded by them.&mdash;But, alas! Sir, who is <HI>good?</HI></P>
<P>As to your arguments; I hope you will believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you, as I now do, that your opinion, and your rea&s;onings, have, and will always have, great and de&s;erved weight with me: And that I re&s;pect you &s;till more than I did, if po&s;&s;ible, for your expo&s;tulations in fa|vour of the end of my cou&s;in's pious injunctions to me. They come from <HI>you,</HI> Sir, with the greate&s;t propriety, as her executor and repre&s;entative; and likewi&s;e as you are a man of humanity, and a well-wi&s;her to both parties.</P>
<P>I am not exempt from violent pa&s;&s;ions, Sir, any more than your friend; but then I hope they are only capable of being rai&s;ed by other peoples in&s;olence, and not by my own arrogance, If ever I am &s;timulated by my imper|fections and my re&s;entments to act again&s;t my judgment, and my cou&s;in's injunctions; &s;ome &s;uch reflections as the&s;e that follow, will run away with my rea&s;on. Indeed they are always pre&s;ent with me.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>In the fir&s;t place; My own di&s;appointment: Who came over with the hope of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of my days in the conver&s;ation of a kin&s;woman &s;o beloved; and to whom I had a double relation, as her cou&s;in and tru&s;tee.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Then I reflect, too-too often perhaps for my engage|ments to her in her la&s;t hours, that the dear creature could only forgive for <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> She, no doubt, is happy: But who &s;hall forgive for a <HI>whole family,</HI> in all its branches made mi&s;erable for their lives?</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the more faulty her friends were as to <HI>her,</HI> the more enormous his ingratitude, and the more inex|cu&s;able&mdash;What! Sir, was it not enough, that &s;he &s;uffered what &s;he did <HI>for him,</HI> but the barbarian mu&s;t make her &s;uffer for her &s;ufferings for <HI>his &s;ake?</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="351" REF="354">
Pa&s;&s;ion makes me expre&s;s this weakly: Pa&s;&s;ion refu&s;es &s;trength &s;ometimes, where the propriety of a re&s;ent|ment <HI>prima facie</HI> declares expre&s;&s;ion to be needle&s;s. I leave it to <HI>you,</HI> Sir, to give this reflection its due force.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the author of this diffu&s;ive mi&s;chief perpetrated it premeditatedly, wantonly, in the gaiety of his heart. To <HI>try</HI> my cou&s;in, &s;ay you, Sir? To try the virtue of a Clari&s;&s;a, Sir!&mdash;Had &s;he then given him any cau&s;e to doubt her virtue?&mdash;It could not be.&mdash;If he averrs that &s;he did&mdash;I am indeed called upon&mdash;But I will have patience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That he carried her, as now it appears, to a vile bro|thel, purpo&s;ely to put her out of all human re&s;ource; Him&s;elf out of the reach of all humane remor&s;e: And that, finding her proof again&s;t all the common arts of delu&s;ion, ba&s;e and unmanly arts were there u&s;ed to effect his wicked purpo&s;es. <HI>Once dead,</HI> the injured &s;aint, in her will, &s;ays, <HI>he has &s;een her.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>That I could not know this, when I &s;aw him at M.

<ITEM>That he is a man of defiance: A man who thinks to awe every-one by his in&s;olent darings, and by his pre|ten&s;ions to &s;uperior courage and &s;kill.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That, di&s;grace as he is to his name, and to the cha|racter of a gentleman, the man would not want his merit, who, in vindication of the <HI>di&s;honoured</HI> di&s;tin|ction, &s;hould expunge and blot him out of the wor|thy li&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>That the injured family has a &s;on, who, however un|worthy of &s;uch a &s;i&s;ter, is of a temper vehement, un|bridled, fierce, unequal therefore (as he has once in|deed been found) to a contention with this man: The

<HEAD>LETTER XCVI. Colonel <HI>MORDEN,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Tue&s;day, Sept.</HI> 26.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot help congratulating my&s;elf as well as you, that we have already got thro' with the family every arti|cle of the Will, where <HI>they</HI> have any concern.</P>
<P>You left me a di&s;cretional power, in many in&s;tances; and, in pur&s;uance of it, I have had my dear cou&s;in's per|&s;onal jewels valued; and will account to you for them, at the highe&s;t price, when I come to town, as well as for other matters that you were plea&s;ed to intru&s;t to my ma|nagement.</P>
<P>The&s;e jewels I have pre&s;ented to my cou&s;in Dolly Her|vey, in acknowlegement of her love to the dear departed. I have told Mi&s;s Howe of this; and &s;he is as well plea&s;ed with what I have done, as if &s;he had been the purcha&s;er of them her&s;elf. As that young lady has jewels of her own, &s;he could only have wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e the&s;e for her beloved friend's &s;ake.</P>
<P>The grandmother's jewels are al&s;o valued; and the mo|ney will be paid me, for you, to be carried to the u&s;es of the Will.</P>
<P>Mrs. Norton is preparing, by general con&s;ent, to enter upon her office as hou&s;ekeeper at <HI>The Grove.</HI> But it is my opinion, that &s;he will not be long on this &s;ide Heaven.</P>
<P>I waited upon Mi&s;s Howe my&s;elf, as I told you I would, with what was bequeathed to her and her mother. If I make a few ob&s;ervations with regard to that young lady, &s;o dear to my beloved cou&s;in, you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed perhaps, as you have not a per&s;onal acquaintance with her.</P>
<P>There never was a firmer and nobler friend&s;hip in wo|men, than that which the wretched man has put an end to, between my dear cou&s;in and Mi&s;s Howe.</P>
<P><HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> generally &s;peaking, Mr. Belford, is too fer|vent a flame for female minds to manage: A light, that but in few of their hands burns &s;teady, and often hurries the Sex into flight and ab&s;urdity. Like other extremes, it is hardly ever durable. Marriage, which is the highe&s;t
<PB N="356" REF="359">
&s;tate of friend&s;hip, generally ab&s;orbs the mo&s;t vehement friend&s;hips of female to female; and that whether the wed|lock be happy, or not.</P>
<P>What female mind is capable of two fervent friend&s;hips at the &s;ame time?</P>
<P>This I mention as a <HI>general ob&s;ervation:</HI> But the friend|&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e two ladies affords a re|markable exception to it: Which I account for from tho&s;e qualities and attainments in <HI>both,</HI> which, were they more common, would furni&s;h more exceptions &s;till in favour of the Sex. Both had an <HI>inlarged,</HI> and even a <HI>liberal</HI> educa|tion: Both had minds thir&s;ting after virtuous knowlege. Great readers both: Great writers&mdash;[And <HI>early familiar writing</HI> I take to be one of the greate&s;t openers and im|provers of the mind, that man or woman can be imployed in.] Both generous. High in fortune; therefore above that dependence each on the other, that frequently de&s;troys the familiarity which is the cement of friend&s;hip. Both excelling in <HI>different ways,</HI> in which neither &s;ought to emu|late the other. Both ble&s;&s;ed with clear and di&s;tingui&s;hing faculties; with &s;olid &s;en&s;e; and from their fir&s;t intimacy [I have many of my lights, Sir, from Mrs. Norton] each &s;eeing &s;omething in the other to <HI>fear,</HI> as well as <HI>love</HI>; yet making it an indi&s;pen&s;able condition of their friend&s;hip each to tell the other of her failings; and to be thankful for the freedom taken. One by nature <HI>gentle</HI>; the other <HI>made &s;o,</HI> by her <HI>love</HI> and <HI>admiration</HI> of her exalted friend&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible that there could be a friend&s;hip better calcu|lated for duration.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however take the liberty to blame Mi&s;s Howe for her behaviour to Mr. Hickman. And I infer from it, that even women of &s;en&s;e are not to be tru&s;ted with power.</P>
<P>By the way, I am &s;ure I need not de&s;ire you not to communicate to this fervent young lady the liberties I take with her character.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, my cou&s;in could not approve of Mi&s;s Howe's behaviour to this gentleman: A behaviour which is talked of by as many as know Mr. Hickman and her. Can a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> young lady be ea&s;y under &s;uch cen&s;ure?&mdash;She <HI>mu&s;t</HI> know it.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="360">Mr. Hickman is really a very worthy man. Every-body &s;peaks well of him. But he is gentle-di&s;po&s;itioned, and he adores Mi&s;s Howe; and Love admits not of an air of even due dignity to the object of it. Yet will he hardly ever get back the reins he has yielded up; unle&s;s &s;he, by carrying too far the power &s;he &s;eems at pre&s;ent too &s;en&s;i|ble of, &s;hould, when &s;he has no favours to confer which he has not a right to demand, provoke him to throw off the too heavy yoke. And &s;hould he do &s;o, and then treat her with negligence, Mi&s;s Howe, of all the women I know, will be the lea&s;t able to &s;upport her&s;elf under it. She will then be <HI>more</HI> unhappy than &s;he ever made him: For a man who is unea&s;y at home can divert him&s;elf abroad; which a woman cannot &s;o ea&s;ily do, without &s;candal.</P>
<P>Permit me to take further notice, as to Mi&s;s Howe; that it is very obvious to me, that &s;he has, by her haughty behaviour to this worthy man, involved her&s;elf in one dif|ficulty, from which &s;he knows not how to extricate her&s;elf with that grace, which accompanies all her actions. She intends to have Mr. Hickman. I believe &s;he does not di&s;|like him. And it will co&s;t her no &s;mall pains to de&s;cend from the elevation &s;he has climbed to.</P>
<P>Another inconveniency &s;he will &s;uffer from her having taught every-body (for &s;he is above di&s;gui&s;e) to think, by her treatment of Mr. Hickman, much more meanly of him than he de&s;erves to be thought of, And mu&s;t <HI>&s;he</HI> not &s;uf|fer di&s;honour in <HI>his</HI> di&s;honour?</P>
<P>Mrs. Howe is much di&s;turbed at her daughter's beha|viour to the gentleman. He is very de&s;ervedly a favour|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite of hers. But (<HI>another</HI> failing in Mi&s;s Howe!) her mo|ther has not all the authority with her that her daughter's good &s;en&s;e ought to permit her to have. It is very diffi|cult, Mr. Belford, for people of <HI>different</HI> or <HI>contrary</HI> di&s;|po&s;itions (tho' no bad people neither) to mingle REVE|RENCE with their <HI>Love</HI> for each other; even where <HI>Nature</HI> has called for <HI>Love</HI> in the relation&s;hip.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe is <HI>open, generous, noble.</HI> The Mother has not any of the&s;e fine qualities. Parents, in order to pre|&s;erve their childrens veneration for them, &s;hould take great care not to let them &s;ee any-thing in their conduct,
<PB N="358" REF="361">
or behaviour, or principles, which they them&s;elves would not approve of in others.</P>
<P>But, after all, I &s;ee that there is &s;omething &s;o charm|ingly brilliant and frank in Mi&s;s Howe's di&s;po&s;ition, al|tho' at pre&s;ent vi&s;ibly overclouded by grief, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible not to love her even for her failings. She <HI>may,</HI> and I hope &s;he <HI>will,</HI> make Mr. Hickman an obliging wife. And if &s;he do, &s;he will have an additional merit with me; &s;ince &s;he cannot be apprehen&s;ive of check or controul; and may therefore by her <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> and <HI>prudence</HI> lay an obliga|tion upon her hu&s;band, by the performance of what is no more than her <HI>duty.</HI></P>
<P>Her mother both <HI>loves</HI> and <HI>fears</HI> her. Yet is Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity, and ready enough, I dare &s;ay, to cry out when &s;he is pained. But, alas! &s;he has, as I hinted above, <HI>weakened her authority</HI> by the <HI>narrow|ne&s;s of her mind.</HI></P>
<P>Yet once &s;he prai&s;ed her daughter to me for the gene|ro&s;ity of her &s;pirit, with &s;o much <HI>warmth,</HI> that had I not known the old lady's character, I &s;hould have thought her generous <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> And yet I have always ob&s;erved, that people even of narrow tempers are ready to prai&s;e gene|rous ones:&mdash;And thus have I accounted for it, that &s;uch per&s;ons generally find it to their purpo&s;e, that all the world &s;hould be open-minded but them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The old lady applied her&s;elf to me, to urge to the young one the contents of the Will, in order to ha&s;ten her to fix a day for her marriage: But de&s;ired that I would not let Mi&s;s Howe know that &s;he did.</P>
<P>I took the liberty upon it to tell the young lady, that I hoped that <HI>her</HI> part of a Will, &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o punctu|ally, in almo&s;t all its other articles, fulfilled, would not be the only one that would be &s;lighted.</P>
<P>Her an&s;wer was, She would con&s;ider of it: And made me a courte&s;y with &s;uch an air, as &s;hewed me, that &s;he thought me more out of my &s;phere, than I could allow her to think me, had I been permitted to argue the point with her.</P>
<P>I found both Mi&s;s Howe and her own &s;ervant-maid in deep mourning. This, it &s;eems, had occa&s;ioned a great de|bate at fir&s;t between her mother and her. Her mother had
<PB N="359" REF="362">
the words of the Will on her &s;ide; and Mr. Hickman's inter|e&s;t in her view; as her daughter had &s;aid, that &s;he would wear it for &s;ix months at lea&s;t. But the young lady car|ried her point&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Strange, &s;aid &s;he, if I, who &s;hall mourn the heavy, the irreparable lo&s;s to the la&s;t hour of my life, &s;hould not &s;hew my concern to the world for a few months.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, for his part, was &s;o far from uttering an oppo&s;ing word on this occa&s;ion, that, on the very day that Mi&s;s Howe put on hers, he waited on her in a new &s;uit of mourning, as for a near relation. His &s;ervants and equipage made the &s;ame re&s;pectful appearance.</P>
<P>Whether the mother was con&s;ulted by him in it, I can|not &s;ay; but the daughter knew nothing of it, till &s;he &s;aw him in it. She looked at him with &s;urprize, and a&s;ked him, for whom he mourned?</P>
<P>The dear, and ever-dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, he &s;aid.</P>
<P>She was at a lo&s;s, it &s;eems&mdash;At la&s;t&mdash;All the world ought to mourn for my Clari&s;&s;a, &s;aid &s;he; but who, Man, (that was her addre&s;s to him) thinke&s;t thou to oblige by this appearance?</P>
<P>It is more than <HI>appearance,</HI> madam. I love not my own &s;i&s;ter, worthy as &s;he is, better than I loved Mi&s;s Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe. I oblige <HI>my&s;elf</HI> by it. And if I di&s;oblige not you, that is all I have to wi&s;h.</P>
<P>She &s;urveyed him, I am told, from head to foot. She knew not, at fir&s;t, whether to be angry or plea&s;ed&mdash;At length, I thought at fir&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, that you might have a bolder and freer motive&mdash;But (as my mamma &s;ays) you may be a well-meaning man, tho' generally a little wrong-headed&mdash;However, as the world is cen&s;orious, and may think us nearer of kin than I would have it &s;uppo&s;ed, I mu&s;t take care, hone&s;t friend, that I am not &s;een abroad in your company.</P>
<P>But let me add, Mr. Belford, that if this compliment of Mr. Hickman (or this <HI>more</HI> than compliment, as I may well call it, &s;ince the worthy man &s;peaks not of my dear cou&s;in without emotion) does not produce a &s;hort day, I &s;hall think Mi&s;s Howe has le&s;s genero&s;ity in her temper than I am willing to allow her.</P>
<P>You will excu&s;e me, Mr. Belford, I dare &s;ay, for the particularities which you have invited and encouraged.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="363">Having now &s;een every-thing that relates to the Will of my dear cou&s;in brought to a de&s;irable i&s;&s;ue, I will &s;et about making my own. I &s;hall follow the dear creature's exam|ple, and give my rea&s;ons for every article, that there may be no room for after-contention.</P>
<P>What but a fear of death, a fear unworthy of a creature who knows that he mu&s;t one day as &s;urely die as he was born, can hinder any one from making &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition?</P>
<P>I hope &s;oon to pay my re&s;pects to you in town. Mean time, I am, with great re&s;pect, dear SIR,</P>

<P><PB N="361" REF="364">Will you allow me, Madam, however, to tell you, that I my&s;elf could not have believed that my inimitable te&s;ta|trix's own Mi&s;s Howe would have been the mo&s;t backward in performing &s;uch a part of her dear friend's la&s;t Will, as is intirely in her own power to perform&mdash;E&s;pecially, when that performance would make one of the mo&s;t de&s;erving men in England happy; and whom, I pre&s;ume, &s;he pro|po&s;es to honour with her hand?</P>

<P>I will not pre&s;ume to make remarks on the letters I &s;end you: Nor upon the informations I have to give you of the dreadful end of two unhappy wretches, who were the greate&s;t criminals in the affair of your adorable friend.

<HEAD>LETTER XCVIII. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> E&s;q.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sat. Sept.</HI> 30.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Little thought I ever could have owed &s;o much obliga|tion to any man, as you have laid me under. And yet what you have &s;ent me has almo&s;t broken my heart, and ruined my eyes.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, tho' agreeably, that you have &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o well, got over that part of the tru&s;t you have en|gaged in which relates to the family.</P>
<P>It may be pre&s;umed, from the exits you mention of two of the infernal man's accomplices, that the thunder|bolt will not &s;top &s;hort of the principal. Indeed I have &s;ome plea&s;ure to think it &s;eems rolling along towards the devoted head that has plotted all the mi&s;chief. But let me, however, &s;ay, that altho' I think Mr. Morden not al|together in the wrong in his rea&s;ons for re&s;enting, as he is the dear creature's Kin&s;man and Tru&s;tee; yet I think you very much in the right in endeavouring to di&s;&s;uade him from it, as you are her Executor, and act in pur&s;uance of her earne&s;t reque&s;t.</P>
<P>But what a letter is that of the infernal man! I cannot ob&s;erve upon it. Neither can I, for very different rea|&s;ons, upon my dear creature's po&s;thumous letters; parti|cularly on that to him. Oh! Mr. Belford! what number|le&s;s perfections died, when my Clari&s;&s;a drew her la&s;t breath!</P>
<P>If decency be ob&s;erved in his letters (for I have not yet had patience to read above two or three of them, be&s;ides this horrid one, which I return you inclo&s;ed) I may &s;ome time hence be curious to look, by <HI>their</HI> means, into the hearts of wretches, which, tho' they mu&s;t be the abhor|rence of virtuous minds, will, when laid open (as I pre|&s;ume they are in them) afford a <HI>proper warning</HI> to tho&s;e who read them, and teach them to <HI>dete&s;t men of &s;uch pro|fiigate characters.</HI></P>
<P>If your reformation be &s;incere, you will not be of|fended that I except you not on this occa&s;ion.&mdash;And thus have I helped you to a criterion to try your&s;elf by.</P>
<P>By this letter of the wicked man it is apparent, that
<PB N="363" REF="366">
there are &s;till wickeder women. But &s;ee what a guilty commerce with the devils of your &s;ex will bring tho&s;e to, who&s;e morals ye have ruined!&mdash;For the&s;e women were once innocent: It was <HI>man</HI> that made them otherwi&s;e. The fir&s;t bad man, perhaps, threw them upon wor&s;e men: Tho&s;e upon &s;till wor&s;e; till they commenced devils incar|nate&mdash;The height of wickedne&s;s, or of &s;hame, is not ar|rived at all at once, as I have &s;omewhere heard ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>But this man, this mon&s;ter rather, for <HI>him</HI> to cur&s;e the&s;e women, and to cur&s;e the dear creature's family (implaca|ble as the latter were) in order to lighten a burden he vo|luntarily took up, and groans under, is <HI>meanne&s;s</HI> added to <HI>wickedne&s;s:</HI> And in vain will he one day find his low plea of &s;haring with her friends, and with tho&s;e common wretches, a guilt which will be adjudged him as all his own; tho' they too may meet with their puni&s;hment: As it is evi|dently begun; in the fir&s;t, in their ineffectual reproaches of one another; in the &s;econd, as you have told me.</P>
<P>This letter of the abandoned wretch I have not &s;hewn to any-body; not even to Mr. Hickman: For, Sir, I mu&s;t tell you, I do not as <HI>yet</HI> think it the &s;ame thing as only &s;eeing it my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, like the re&s;t of his &s;ex, would grow up|on indulgence. One di&s;tinction from me would make him pay two to him&s;elf. In&s;olent creepers, or incroach|ers, all of you! To &s;hew any of you a <HI>favour</HI> to-day, you would expect it as a <HI>right</HI> to-morrow.</P>
<P>I am, as you &s;ee, very open and &s;incere with you; and de&s;ign in another letter to be &s;till more &s;o, in an&s;wer to your call, and Colonel Morden's call, upon me, in a point that concerns me to explain my&s;elf upon to my beloved creature's Executor, and to her <HI>only tender</HI> and <HI>only worthy</HI> relation.</P>
<P>I cannot but highly applaud Colonel Morden for his genero&s;ity to Mi&s;s Dolly Hervey.</P>
<P>O that he had arrived time enough to &s;ave my inimi|table friend from the machinations of the vile&s;t of men, and from the envy and malice of the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h and im|placable of brothers and &s;i&s;ters!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCIX. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To <HI>JOHN BELFORD,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Monday, Oct.</HI> 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you que&s;tion me, Sir, as you do, and on a &s;ubject &s;o affecting to me, in the character of the repre&s;entative of my be&s;t-beloved friend, and have in every particular hitherto acted up to that character, you are in|titled to my regard: E&s;pecially as in your que&s;tioning of me you are joined by a gentleman, whom I look upon as the deare&s;t and neare&s;t (becau&s;e worthie&s;t) relation of my dear friend: And who, it &s;eems, has been &s;o &s;evere a cen|&s;urer of my conduct, that your politene&s;s will not permit you to &s;end me his letter, with others of his; but a copy only, in which the pa&s;&s;ages reflecting upon me are omitted.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, however, that what is meant by this alarm|ing freedom of the Colonel's, is no more than what you both have already hinted to me; as if you thought I were not inclined to pay &s;o much regard to my beloved crea|tures la&s;t Will, in my own ca&s;e, as I would have others pay to it. A charge that I ought not to be quite &s;ilent under.</P>
<P>You have ob&s;erved, no doubt, that I have &s;eemed to value my&s;elf upon the freedom I take in declaring my &s;entiments without re&s;erve upon every &s;ubject that I pre|tend to touch upon: And I can hardly que&s;tion that I have, or &s;hall, in your opinion, by my unceremonious treatment of you upon &s;o &s;hort an acquaintance, run into the error of tho&s;e, who, wanting to be thought above hy|pocri&s;y and flattery, fall into ru&s;ticity, if not ill-manners; a common fault with &s;uch, who, not caring to correct con&s;titutional failings, &s;eek to glo&s;s them over by &s;ome <HI>nominal</HI> virtue; when all the time, perhaps, it is native arrogance; or, at lea&s;t, a contracted ru&s;t, that they will not, becau&s;e it would give them pain, &s;ubmit to have filed off.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Sir, that I can, however, be as free with my|&s;elf as with you: And, by what I am going to write, you will find me &s;till more free: And yet I am aware, that &s;uch of my &s;ex as will not a&s;&s;ume &s;ome little dignity, and
<PB N="365" REF="368">
exact re&s;pect from yours, will render them&s;elves cheap; and perhaps, for their mode&s;ty and diffidence, be repaid with &s;corn and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>But the &s;corn I will endeavour not to de&s;erve; and the in&s;ult I will not bear.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the dear creature's papers, which you have had in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and mu&s;t again have for tran&s;crip|tion, you will find &s;everal friendly but &s;evere reprehen|&s;ions of me, on account of a natural, or, at lea&s;t, an <HI>ha|bitual,</HI> warmth of temper, which &s;he was plea&s;ed to im|pute to me.</P>
<P>I was thinking to give you her charge again&s;t me in her own words, from one of her letters delivered to <HI>me</HI> with her own hands, on taking leave of me, on the la&s;t vi&s;it &s;he honoured me with. But I will &s;upply that charge by confe&s;&s;ion of more than it imports; to wit,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I am haughty, uncontroulable, and violent in my temper;'</Q>
<HI>This I &s;ay:</HI> <Q REND="inline">'Impatient of contradiction,'</Q> <HI>was my beloved's charge</HI> (from any-body but her dear &s;elf, &s;he &s;hould have &s;aid);
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'and aim not at that affability, that gentlene&s;s next to meekne&s;s, which, in the letter I was going to communicate, &s;he tells me, are the peculiar and indi&s;|pen&s;able characteri&s;tics of a real fine lady; who, &s;he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;hould appear to be gall-le&s;s as a dove; and never &s;hould know what warmth or high &s;pirit is, but in the cau&s;e of Religion or Virtue; or in ca&s;es where her own honour, the honour of a friend, or that of an innocent per&s;on, is concerned.'</Q></P>
<P>Now, Sir, as I mu&s;t needs plead guilty to this indict|ment, do you think I ought not to re&s;olve upon a Single Life?&mdash;I, who have &s;uch an opinion of your &s;ex, that I think there is not one man in an hundred whom a woman of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit can either <HI>honour</HI> or <HI>obey,</HI> tho' you make us promi&s;e <HI>both,</HI> in that &s;olemn form of words which unites or rather <HI>binds</HI> us to you in marriage?</P>
<P>When I look round upon all the married people of my acquaintance, and &s;ee how <HI>they</HI> live, and what <HI>they</HI> bear, who live <HI>be&s;t,</HI> I am confirmed in my di&s;like to the State.</P>
<P>Well do your &s;ex contrive to bring us up fools and idi|ots, in order to make us bear the yoke you lay upon our
<PB N="366" REF="369">
&s;houlders; and that we may not de&s;pi&s;e you from our hearts (as we certainly &s;hould, if we were brought up as you are) for your ignorance, as much as you often make us do (as it is) for your in&s;olence.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are &s;ome of my notions. And, with the&s;e notions, let me repeat my que&s;tion, <HI>Do you think I ought to marry at all?</HI></P>
<P>If I marry either a &s;ordid or an imperious wretch, can I, do you think, live with him? And ought a man of a contrary character, for the &s;ake of either of our reputa|tions, to be plagued with me?</P>
<P>Long did I &s;tand out again&s;t all the offers made me, and again&s;t all the per&s;ua&s;ions of my mother; and, to tell you the truth, the <HI>longer,</HI> and with the <HI>more</HI> ob&s;tinacy, as the per&s;on my choice would have at fir&s;t fallen upon, was neither approved by my mother, nor by my dear friend. This riveted me to my pride, and to my oppo&s;ition: For altho' I was convinced after a while, that my choice would neither have been prudent nor happy; and that the &s;pe|cious wretch was not what he had made me believe he was; yet could I not ea&s;ily think of any other man: And indeed, from the detection of him, took a &s;ettled aver|&s;ion to the whole &s;ex.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Mr. Hickman offered him&s;elf; a man worthy of a better choice. He had the good fortune [he thinks it &s;o] to be agreeable (and to make his propo&s;als agreeable) to my mother.</P>
<P>As to my&s;elf; I own, that were I to have cho&s;en a Bro|ther, Mr. Hickman &s;hould have been the man; virtuous, &s;ober, &s;incere, friendly, as he is. But I wi&s;hed not to marry: Nor knew I the man in the world whom I could think de&s;erving of my beloved friend. But neither of our parents would let us live &s;ingle.</P>
<P>The accur&s;ed Lovelace was propo&s;ed warmly to <HI>her,</HI> at one time; and, while &s;he was yet but indifferent to him, they by ungenerous u&s;age of him (for then, Sir, he was not known to be Beelzebub him&s;elf) and by endeavour|ing to force her inclinations in favour fir&s;t of one worthle&s;s man, then of another, in antipathy to him, thro' her fool|i&s;h brother's caprice, turned that indifference (from the
<PB N="367" REF="370">
natural genero&s;ity of her &s;oul) into a regard which &s;he never otherwi&s;e would have had for a man of his cha|racter.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman was propo&s;ed to me. I refu&s;ed him again and again. He per&s;i&s;ted: My mother his advocate. My mother made my beloved friend his advocate too. I told him my aver&s;ion to all men: To him: To matrimony.&mdash;Still he per&s;i&s;ted. I u&s;ed him with tyranny: Led indeed partly by my temper, partly by de&s;ign; hoping thereby to get rid of him; till the poor man (his character un|exceptionably uniform) &s;till per&s;i&s;ting, made him&s;elf a merit with me by his patience. This brought down my pride [I never, Sir, was accounted very ungenerous, nor quite ingrateful] and gave me, at one time, an inferiority in my own opinion to him; which la&s;ted ju&s;t long enough for my friends to prevail upon me to promi&s;e him encou|ragement; and to receive his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Having &s;o done, when the weather-gla&s;s of my pride got up again, I found I had gone too far to recede. My mother and my friend both held me to it. Yet I tried him; I vexed him an hundred ways; and not &s;o much neither with de&s;ign to vex him, as to make him hate me, and de|cline his &s;uit.</P>
<P>He bore this, however; and got nothing but my pity: Yet &s;till my mother and my friend, having obtained my promi&s;e (made, however, not to <HI>him,</HI> but to <HI>them</HI>) and being well a&s;&s;ured that I valued no man <HI>more</HI> than Mr. Hickman (who never once di&s;obliged me in word, or deed, or look, except by his fooli&s;h per&s;everance) in|&s;i&s;ted upon the performance.</P>
<P>While my dear friend was in her unhappy uncertainty, I could not think of marriage: And now, what encou|ragement have I?&mdash;She, my monitre&s;s, my guide, my coun&s;el, gone, for ever gone!&mdash;By who&s;e advice and in|&s;tructions I hoped to acquit my&s;elf tolerably in the State into which I could not avoid entering. For, Sir, my mo|ther is &s;o partially Mr. Hickman's friend, that I am &s;ure, &s;hould any difference ari&s;e, &s;he would always cen&s;ure me, and acquit him; even were he ungenerous enough to re|member me in his day.</P>
<P>This, Sir, being my &s;ituation, con&s;ider how difficult it
<PB N="368" REF="371">
is for me to think of marriage. Whenever we approve, we can find an hundred good rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify our approba|tion. Whenever we di&s;like, we can find a thou&s;and to ju&s;tify our di&s;like. Every-thing in the latter ca&s;e is an impediment: Every &s;hadow a bugbear.&mdash;Thus can I enumerate and &s;well perhaps only <HI>imaginary</HI> grievances;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I mu&s;t go whither he would have me to go: Vi&s;it whom he would have me to vi&s;it: Well as I love to write (tho' now, alas! my grand inducement to write is over) it mu&s;t be to whom he plea&s;es:'</Q>
And Mrs. Hickman (who, as Mi&s;s Howe, can|not do wrong) would hardly ever be able to do right. Thus, the tables turned upon me, I am reminded of my broken-vowed obedience; Madam'd up perhaps to matrimonial perfection, and all the wedded warfare practi&s;ed comfort|ably over between us (for I &s;hall not be pa&s;&s;ive under in&s;o|lent treatment) till we become cur&s;es to each other, a bye-word to our neighbours, and the je&s;t of our own &s;ervants.</P>
<P>But there mu&s;t be <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>forbear,</HI> methinks &s;ome wi&s;e body will tell me: But why mu&s;t I be teazed into a State where that <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be nece&s;&s;arily the ca&s;e; when now I can do as I plea&s;e, and wi&s;h only to be let alone to do as be&s;t plea&s;es me? And what, in effect, does my mother &s;ay?
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Anna Howe, you now do every-thing that plea&s;es you: You now have no-body to controul you: You go and you come; you dre&s;s and you undre&s;s; you ri&s;e and you go to re&s;t; ju&s;t as you think be&s;t: But you mu&s;t be hap|pier &s;till, child!&mdash;'</Q></P>
<P>As how, Madam?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Why, you mu&s;t marry, my dear, and have none of the&s;e options; but, in every-thing, do as your hu&s;band commands you.'</Q></P>
<P>This is very hard, you will own, Sir, for &s;uch a one as me to think of. And yet, engaged to enter into that State, as I am, how can I help my&s;elf? My mother pre&s;|&s;es me; my friend, my beloved friend, writing as from the dead, pre&s;&s;es me; and you, and Mr. Morden, as Exe|cutors of her Will, remind me; the man is not afraid of me [I am &s;ure, were I <HI>the</HI> man, I &s;hould not have half his courage]; and I think I ought to conclude to puni&s;h him (the only effectual way I have to do it) for his per|ver&s;e adherence and per&s;ecution, as many other per&s;ons are puni&s;hed, with the grant of his own wi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="372">Let me then a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that when I can find, in the words of my charming friend in her Will, writing of her cou&s;in Hervey, that my grief for her is <HI>mellowed by time into a remembrance more &s;weet than painful,</HI> that I may not be utterly unworthy of the pa&s;&s;ion a man of &s;ome me|rit has for me, I will an&s;wer the reque&s;t of my dear friend, &s;o often repeated, and &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed; and Mr. Hick|man &s;hall find, if he continue to de&s;erve my gratitude, that my endeavours &s;hall not be wanting to make him amends for the patience he has had, and mu&s;t &s;till for a little while longer have, with me: And then will it be his own fault (I hope not mine) if our marriage an&s;wer not tho&s;e happy <HI>progno&s;tics, which filled her</HI> generous <HI>pre|&s;aging mind,</HI> upon this view, as &s;he once, for <HI>my</HI> encou|ragement, and to induce me to encourage <HI>him,</HI> told me.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, have I, in a very free manner, accounted to you, as to the Executor of my beloved friend, for all that relates to you, as &s;uch, to know; and even for more than I needed to do, again&s;t my&s;elf: Only that you will find as much again&s;t me in &s;ome of <HI>her</HI> letters; and &s;o, <HI>lo&s;ing</HI> no|thing, I <HI>gain</HI> the character of <HI>ingenuity</HI> with you.</P>
<P>And thus much for the double reprimand, on my de|laying my part of the performance of my dear friend's Will.</P>
<P>And now let me remind you of one great article relate|ing to your&s;elf, while you are admoni&s;hing me on this &s;ubject: It is furni&s;hed me by her po&s;thumous letter to you&mdash;I hope you will not forget, that the mo&s;t benevo|lent of her &s;ex expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf as earne&s;tly concerned for your thorough reformation, as &s;he does for my marrying. You'll &s;ee to it then, that her wi&s;hes are as completely an|&s;wered in that particular, as you are de&s;irous they &s;hould be in all others.</P>
<P>I have, I own, di&s;obeyed the dear creature in one ar|ticle; and that is, where &s;he de&s;ires that I will not put my|&s;elf into mourning. I could not help it.</P>
<P>I &s;end this and mine of Saturday la&s;t together: And will not add another word, after I have told you, that I think my&s;elf</P>

<P>I will only &s;ay, that it &s;hall be my earne&s;t and un|wearied endeavour to make tho&s;e generous wi&s;hes effect|ual: And I hope for the Divine ble&s;&s;ing upon &s;uch my endeavours, or el&s;e I know they will be in vain.</P>

<P>MY kin&s;man Lovelace is now &s;etting out for London; propo&s;ing to &s;ee you, and then to go to Dover, and &s;o embark. God &s;end him well out of the kingdom!</P>
<P>On Monday he will be with you, I believe. Pray let me be favoured with an account of all your conver&s;ations; for Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville are to be there too; and whether you think he is grown quite his own man again. What I mo&s;tly write for is, to wi&s;h you to keep Colonel Morden and him a&s;under, and &s;o to give you no|tice of his going to town. I &s;hould be very loth thee &s;hould be any mi&s;chief between them, as you gave me notice that the Colonel threatened my nephew. But my kin&s;man would not bear that; &s;o no-body let him know that he did. But I hope there is no fear: For the Colo|nel does not, as I hear, threaten now. For his own &s;ake, I am glad of that; for there is not &s;uch a man in the world as my kin&s;man is &s;aid to be, at all the weapons&mdash;As well he was not; he would not be &s;o daring.</P>
<P>We &s;hall all here mi&s;s the wild fellow. To be &s;ure, there is no man better company when he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Pray, do you never travel thirty or forty mile? I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee you here at M. Hall. It will be charity, when my kin&s;man is gone; for we &s;uppo&s;e you will be his chief corre&s;pondent: Altho' he has promi&s;ed to write to my nieces often. But he is very apt to forget his pro|mi&s;es; To us his relations particularly. God pre&s;erve us all; Amen! prays</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Obey your Lord&s;hip's commands with great plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday in the afternoon Mr. Lovelace made me a vi&s;it at my lodgings. As I was in expectation of one
<PB N="372" REF="375">
from Colonel Morden about the &s;ame time, I thought proper to carry him to a tavern which neither of us fre|quented (on pretence of an half-appointment); ordering notice to be &s;ent me thither, if the Colonel came: And Mr. Lovelace &s;ent to Mowbray, and Tourville, and Mr. Doleman of Uxbri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge (who came to town to take leave of him) to let them know where to find us.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace is <HI>too well</HI> recovered, I was going to &s;ay. I never &s;aw him more gay, lively, and hand&s;ome. We had a good deal of blu&s;ter about &s;ome parts of the Tru&s;t I have engaged in; and upon freedoms I had treated him with; in which, he would have it, that I had exceeded our agreed on limits: But on the arrival of our three old companions, and a nephew of Mr. Doleman's (who had a good while been de&s;irous to pa&s;s an hour with Mr. Love|lace) it blew off for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville had al&s;o taken &s;ome exceptions at the freedoms of my pen; and Mr. Love|lace, after his way, took upon him to reconcile us; and did it at the expence of all three; and with &s;uch an infi|nite run of humour and raillery, that we had nothing to do but laugh at what he &s;aid, and at one another. I can deal tolerably with him at my pen; but in conver&s;ation he has no equal. In &s;hort, it was his day. He was glad, he &s;aid, to find him&s;elf alive; and his two friends clap|ping and rubbing their hands twenty times in an hour, declared, that now once more he was all him&s;elf; the charming&s;t fellow in the world; and they would follow him to the furthe&s;t part of the globe.</P>
<P>I threw a bur upon his coat now-and then; but none would &s;tick</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip knows, that there are many things which occa&s;ion a roar of applau&s;e in conver&s;ation, when the heart is <HI>open,</HI> and men are <HI>re&s;olved</HI> to be merry, which will nei|ther bear repeating, nor thinking of afterwards. Common things, in the mouth of a man we admire, and who&s;e wit has pa&s;&s;ed upon us for &s;terling, become, in a gay hour, <HI>uncommon.</HI> We watch every turn of &s;uch a one's counte|nance, and are re&s;olved to laugh when he &s;miles, even before he utters what we are expecting to flow from his lips.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="376">Mr. Doleman and his nephew took leave of us by Twelve. Mowbray and Tourville grew very noi&s;y by One; and were carried off by Two. Wine never moves Mr. Lovelace, notwith&s;tanding a vivacity which generally helps on over-gay &s;pirits. As to my&s;elf, the little part I had taken in their gaiety kept me unconcerned.</P>
<P>The clock &s;truck Three before I could get him into any &s;erious or attentive way&mdash;So natural to him is gaiety of heart; and &s;uch &s;trong hold had the liveline&s;s of the even|ing taken of him. His conver&s;ation you know, my Lord, when his heart is free, runs off to the bottom without any dregs.</P>
<P>But after that hour, and when we thought of parting, he became a little more &s;erious: And then he told me his de|&s;igns, and gave me a plan of his intended tour; wi&s;hing heartily, that I could have accompanied him.</P>
<P>We parted about Four; he not a little di&s;&s;atisfied with me; for we had &s;ome talk about &s;ubjects which, he &s;aid, he loved not to think of; to wit, Mi&s;s Harlowe's Will; my Executor&s;hip; papers I had in confidence communicated to that admirable lady [with no unfriendly de&s;ign, I a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip]; and he in&s;i&s;ting upon, and I refu&s;ing, the return of the letters he had written to me from the time that he had made his fir&s;t addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>He would &s;ee me once again, he &s;aid; and it would be upon very ill terms if I complied not with his reque&s;t. Which I bid him not expect. But, that I might not deny him every-thing, I told him, that I would give him a copy of the Will; tho' I was &s;ure, I &s;aid, when he read it, he would wi&s;h he had never &s;een it.</P>
<P>I had a me&s;&s;age from him about Eleven this morning, de&s;iring me to name a place at which to dine with Him, and Mowbray, and Tourville, for the la&s;t time: And &s;oon after another from Colonel Morden, inviting me to pa&s;s the evening with him at the Bedford-Head in Covent-Garden. And, that I might keep them at di|&s;tance from one another, I appointed Mr. Lovelace at the Eagle in Suffolk-Street.</P>
<P>There I met him, and the two others. We began where we left off at our la&s;t parting; and were very high with each other. But, at la&s;t, all was made up, and he
<PB N="374" REF="377">
offered to forget and forgive every-thing, on condition that I would corre&s;pond with him while abroad, and con|tinue the &s;eries which had been broken thro' by his illne&s;s; and particularly give him, as I had offered, a copy of the Lady's Will.</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed him: And he then fell to raillying me on my gravity, and on my Reformation-&s;chemes, as he called them. As we walked about the room, expecting dinner to be brought in, he laid his hand upon my &s;houlder, then pu&s;hed me from him with a cur&s;e; walking round me, and &s;urveying me from head to foot; then calling for the ob&s;ervation of the others, he turned round upon his heel, and, with one of his peculiar wild airs, Ha, ha, ha, ha, bur&s;t he out, that the&s;e &s;our-faced pro&s;elytes &s;hould take it into their heads that they cannot be pious, without for|feiting both their good-nature and good manners!&mdash;Why Jack, turning me about, pr'y thee look up, man!&mdash;Do&s;t thou not know, that Religion, if it has taken proper hold of the heart, is the mo&s;t chearful <HI>countenance-maker</HI> in the world?&mdash;I have heard my beloved Mi&s;s Harlowe &s;ay &s;o: And &s;he knew, or no-body did. And was not <HI>her</HI> a&s;pect a benign proof of the ob&s;ervation? But by the&s;e wam|blings in thy cur&s;ed gizzard, and thy aukward grimaces, I &s;ee thou'rt but a novice in it yet!&mdash;Ah, Belford, Bel|ford, thou ha&s;t a confounded parcel of briars and thorns to trample over barefoot, before Religion will illumine the&s;e gloomy features!</P>
<P>I give your Lord&s;hip this account, in an&s;wer to your de&s;ire to know, if I think him the man he was?</P>
<P>In our conver&s;ation at dinner, he was balancing whe|ther he &s;hould &s;et out the next morning, or the morning after. But finding he had nothing to do, and Colonel Morden being in town (which, however, I told him not of) I turned the &s;cale; and he agreed upon &s;etting out to-morrow morning; they to &s;ee him imbark; and I pro|mi&s;ed to accompany them for a morning's ride (as they propo&s;ed their hor&s;es); but &s;aid, that I mu&s;t return in the afternoon.</P>
<P>With much reluctance they let me go to my evening's appointment: They little thought with whom: For Mr. Lovelace had put it as a ca&s;e of honour to all of us, whe|ther,
<PB N="375" REF="378">
as he had been told that Mr. Morden and Mr. James Harlowe had thrown out menaces again&s;t him, he ought to leave the kingdom till he had thrown him&s;elf in their way.</P>
<P>Mowbray gave his opinion, that he ought to leave it like a man of honour, as he was; and if he did not take tho&s;e gentlemen to ta&s;k for their opprobrious &s;peeches, that at lea&s;t he &s;hould be &s;een by them in public before he went away; el&s;e they might give them&s;elves airs, as if he had left the kingdom in fear of them.</P>
<P>To this he him&s;elf &s;o much inclined, that it was with difficulty I per&s;uaded him, that, as they had neither of them proceeded to a direct and formal challenge; as they knew he had not made him&s;elf difficult of acce&s;s; and as he had already done the family injury enough; and it was Mi&s;s Harlowe's earne&s;t de&s;ire, that be would be con|tent with that; he had no rea&s;on, from any point of ho|nour, to delay his journey; e&s;pecially as he had &s;o ju&s;t a motive for his going, as the e&s;tabli&s;hing of his health; and as he might return the &s;ooner, if he &s;aw occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>I found the Colonel in a very &s;olemn way. We had a good deal of di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject of letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between us in relation to Mi&s;s Harlowe's Will, and to her family.</P>
<P>He has &s;ome accounts to &s;ettle with his banker; which, he &s;ays, will be adju&s;ted to-morrow; and on Thur&s;day he propo&s;es to go down again, to take leave of his friends; and then intends to &s;et out directly for Italy.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Mr. Lovelace could have been prevailed upon to take any other tour, than that of France and Italy. I did propo&s;e Madrid to him: But he laugh'd at me, and told me, that the propo&s;al was in character from a Mule; and from one who was become as grave as a Spaniard of the old cut, at ninety.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed to the Colonel my apprehen&s;ions, that his cou&s;in's dying injunctions would not have the force upon him, that were to be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>They have great force upon me, Mr. Belford, &s;aid he; or one world would not have held Mr. Lovelace and me thus long. But my intention is to go to Florence; not to lay my bones there, as upon my cou&s;in's death I told you I thought to do; but to &s;ettle all my affairs in tho&s;e
<PB N="376" REF="379">
parts, and then to come over, and re&s;ide upon a little pa|ternal e&s;tate in Kent, which is &s;trangely gone to ruin in my ab&s;ence. Indeed, were I to meet Mr. Lovelace, ei|ther here or abroad, I might not be an&s;werable for the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>He would have engaged me for to-morrow. But having promi&s;ed to attend Mr. Lovelace on his journey, as I have mentioned, I &s;aid, I was obliged to go out of town, and was uncertain as to the time of my return in the evening. And &s;o I am to &s;ee him on Thur&s;day morning at my own lodgings.</P>
<P>I will do my&s;elf the honour to write again to your Lord&s;hip to-morrow night. Mean time, I am, my Lord,</P>

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am ju&s;t returned from attending Mr. Lovelace as far as Gad's-Hill near Roche&s;ter. He was exceeding gay all the way. Mowbray and Tourville are gone on with him. They will &s;ee him embark, and under &s;ail; and promi&s;e to follow him in a month or two; for they &s;ay, there is no living without him, now he is once more him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He and I parted with great and even &s;olemn tokens of affection; but yet not without gay intermixtures, as I will acquaint your Lord&s;hip.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day morning, Oct.</HI> 5.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT may be &s;ome &s;atisfaction to your Lord&s;hip, to have a brief account of what has ju&s;t now pa&s;&s;ed between Colonel Morden and me.</P>
<P>We had a good deal of di&s;cour&s;e about the Harlowe-family, and tho&s;e parts of the Lady's Will which &s;till re|main unexecuted; after which the Colonel addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to me in a manner which gave me &s;ome &s;urprize.</P>
<P>He flattered him&s;elf, he &s;aid, from my pre&s;ent happy turn, and from my good con&s;titution, that I &s;hould live a great many years. It was therefore his reque&s;t, that I would con&s;ent to be <HI>his</HI> Executor; &s;ince it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to make a better choice, or pur&s;ue a better ex|ample, than his cou&s;in had &s;et.</P>
<P>His heart, he &s;aid, was in it: There were &s;ome things in his cou&s;in's Will and <HI>his</HI> analogous; and he had named one per&s;on with me, with whom he was &s;ure I would not refu&s;e to be joined; and to whom he intended to apply for his con&s;ent, when he had obtained mine <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">What is between cretchets thus [], Mr. Belford omitted in the tran&s;cription of this Letter to Mi&s;s Howe.</NOTE>. [Intimating, as far as I could gather, that it was Mr. Hickman, &s;on of Sir Charles Hickman; to whom I know your Lord&s;hip is not a &s;tranger: For he &s;aid. Every one who was dear to his beloved cou&s;in, mu&s;t be &s;o to him: and he knew, that the gentleman whom he had thoughts of, would have, be|&s;ides my advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the advice of one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible ladies in England.]</P>
<P>He took my hand, &s;eeing me under &s;ome &s;urprize: You mu&s;t not he&s;itate, much le&s;s deny me, Mr. Belford. Indeed you mu&s;t not. Two things I will a&s;&s;ure you of: That I have, as I hope, made every-thing &s;o clear, that you cannot have any litigation: And that I have done &s;o ju&s;tly, and I hope it will be thought &s;o generou&s;ly, by all my relations, that a mind like yours will rather have plea|&s;ure than pain in the Execution of this Tru&s;t. And this is
<PB N="379" REF="382">
what I think every hone&s;t man, who hopes to find an ho|ne&s;t man for his Executor, &s;hould do.</P>
<P>I told him, that I was greatly obliged to him for his good opinion of me: That it was &s;o much every man's <HI>duty</HI> to be an hone&s;t man, that it could not be &s;elf-prai&s;e to &s;ay, that I had no doubt to be found &s;o. But if I ac|cepted of this Tru&s;t, it mu&s;t be on condition&mdash;</P>
<P>I could name no condition, he &s;aid, interrupting me, which he would refu&s;e to comply with.</P>
<P>This condition, I told him, was, that as there was as great a probability of his being <HI>my</HI> &s;urvivor, as I <HI>his,</HI> he would permit me to name <HI>him</HI> for mine; and, in that ca&s;e, a week &s;hould not pa&s;s before I made my Will.</P>
<P>With all his heart, he &s;aid; and the readier, as he had no apprehen&s;ions of &s;uddenly dying; for what he had done and reque&s;ted was really the effect of the &s;atisfaction he had taken in the part I had already acted as his cou&s;in's Executor; and in my ability, he was plea&s;ed to add: As well as in pur&s;uance of his cou&s;in's advice in the Preamble to her Will; to wit,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That this was a work which &s;hould be &s;et about in full health, both of body and mind.'</Q></P>
<P>I told him, that I was plea&s;ed to hear him &s;ay, that he was not in any apprehen&s;ion of &s;uddenly dying; as this gave me a&s;&s;urance, that he had laid a&s;ide all thoughts of acting contrary to his beloved cou&s;in's dying reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Does it argue, &s;aid he, &s;miling, that if I were to pur&s;ue a vengeance &s;o ju&s;tifiable in my own opinion, I mu&s;t be in apprehen&s;ion of falling by Mr. Lovelace's hand?&mdash;I will a&s;&s;ure you, that I have no fears of that &s;ort.&mdash;But I know this is an ingrateful &s;ubject to you. Mr. Love|lace is your friend; and I will allow, that a <HI>good</HI> man may have a friend&s;hip for a <HI>bad one,</HI> &s;o far as to wi&s;h him well, without countenancing him in his evil.</P>
<P>I will a&s;&s;ure you, added he, that I have not yet made any re&s;olutions either way. I have told you what force my cou&s;in's repeated reque&s;ts have with me. Hitherto they have with-held me&mdash;But let us quit this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This, Sir (giving me a &s;ealed-up parcel), is my Will. It is witne&s;&s;ed. I made no doubt of prevailing upon you to do me the reque&s;ted favour. I have a duplicate to leave with the other gentleman; and an atte&s;ted copy, which I
<PB N="380" REF="383">
&s;hall depo&s;it at my banker's. At my return, which will be in &s;ix or eight months at farthe&s;t, I will allow you to make an exchange of yours, if you will have it &s;o. I have only now to take leave of my relations in the country. And &s;o God protect you, Mr. Belford! You will &s;oon hear of me again.</P>
<P>He then very &s;olemnly embraced me, as I did him: And we parted.</P>
<P>I heartily congratulate with your Lord&s;hip on the narrow e&s;cape each gentleman has had from the other: For I ap|prehend, that they could not have met without fatal con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>Time, I hope, which &s;ubdues all things, will &s;ubdue their re&s;entments. I am, my Lord,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>

<P>This method, which to others will appear perplexing and unnece&s;&s;ary, her early hours, and cu&s;tom, had made ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to her.</P>

<P>O Mr. Belford! I can write no further on this &s;ubject.

<Q><L>&mdash;Timor &amp; minae</L>
<L>Scandunt eodem quo dominus: neque</L>
<L>Decedit aerata triremi, &amp;</L>
<L>Po&s;t equitem &s;edet atra cura.</L></Q>
<P>IN a language &s;o expre&s;&s;ive as the Engli&s;h, I hate the pedantry of tagging or prefacing what I write with Latin &s;craps; and ever was a cen&s;urer of the motto|mongers among our weekly and daily &s;cribblers. But the&s;e ver&s;es of Horace are &s;o applicable to my ca&s;e, that, whether on &s;hipboard, whether in my po&s;t-chai&s;e, or in my inn at night, I am not able to put them out of my head. Dryden once I thought &s;aid well in the&s;e bouncing lines:
<Q><L>Man makes his Fate according to his mind.</L>
<L>The weak, low &s;pirit Fortune makes her &s;lave:</L>
<L>But &s;he's a drudge, when hector'd by the brave.</L>
<L>If Fate weave common thread, I'll change the doom,</L>
<L>And with new purple weave a nobler loom.</L></Q>
And in the&s;e:
<Q><L>Let Fortune empty her whole quiver on me,</L>
<L>I have a &s;oul, that, like an ample &s;hield,</L>
<L>Can take in all, and verge enough for more.</L>
<L>Fate was not mine: Nor am I Fate's&mdash;</L>
<L>Souls know no conquerors&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But in the fir&s;t quoted lines, con&s;idering them clo&s;ely, there is nothing but blu&s;tering ab&s;urdity: In the other,
<PB N="393" REF="396">
the poet &s;ays not truth; for CONSCIENCE is the Conqueror of Souls: At lea&s;t it is the Conqueror of mine: And who ever thought it a narrow one?</P>
<P>But this is occa&s;ioned partly by poring over the affecting Will, and po&s;thumous Letter. What an army of texts has &s;he drawn up in array again&s;t me in the latter!&mdash;But yet, Jack, do they not &s;hew me, that, two or three thou&s;and years ago, there were as wicked fellows as my&s;elf?&mdash;They do&mdash;And that's &s;ome con&s;olation.</P>
<P>But the genero&s;ity of her mind di&s;play'd in both, is what &s;tings me mo&s;t. And the more &s;till, as it is now out of my power any way in the world to be even with her.</P>
<P>I ought to have written to you &s;ooner. But I loiter'd two days at Calais, for an an&s;wer to a letter I wrote to engage my former travelling valet, De la Tour; an in|genious, ready fellow, as you have heard me &s;ay. I <HI>have</HI> engaged him, and he is now with me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no &s;tay here; but intend for &s;ome of the Electoral courts. That of Bavaria, I think, will engage me longe&s;t. Perhaps I may &s;tep out of my way (if I can be out of my way any-where) to tho&s;e of Dre&s;den and Berlin: And it is not impo&s;&s;ible that you may have one letter from me at Vienna. And then perhaps I may fall down into Italy by the Tirol; and &s;o, taking Turin in my way, return to Paris; where I hope to &s;ee Mowbray and Tourville: Nor do I de&s;pair of you.</P>
<P>This a good deal differs from the plan I gave you. But you may expect to hear from me as I move; and whether I &s;hall pur&s;ue this route, or the other.</P>
<P>I have my former lodgings in the Rue St. Antoine: Which I &s;hall hold, notwith&s;tanding my tour: So they will be ready to accommodate any two of you, if you come hither before my return: And for this I have con|ditioned.</P>
<P>I write to Charlotte; and that is writing to all my re|lations at once.</P>
<P>Do thou, Jack, inform me duly of every-thing that pa&s;&s;es:&mdash;Particularly, How thou proceede&s;t in thy Reforma|tion-&s;cheme: How Mowbray and Tourville go on in my ab&s;ence: Whether thou ha&s;t any chance for a wife [I am the more &s;olicitous on this head, becau&s;e thou &s;eeme&s;t to

Be &s;ure be very minute: For every trifling occurrence re|lating to tho&s;e we value, becomes intere&s;ting, when we are at a di&s;tance from them.

<P>I Write, to &s;hew you, that I am incapable of &s;lighting even the minute&s;t reque&s;ts of an ab&s;ent and di&s;tant friend. Yet you may believe, that there cannot be any great alterations in the little time that you have been out of England, with re&s;pect to the &s;ubjects of your inquiry. Neverthele&s;s I will an&s;wer to each for the rea&s;on above given; and for the rea&s;on you mention, that even trifles and chit-chat are agreeable from friend to friend, and of friends, and even of tho&s;e to whom we give the importance of deeming them our <HI>foes.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, then, as to my Reformation-&s;cheme, as you call it. I hope I go on very well. I wi&s;h you had entered upon the like, and could &s;ay &s;o too. You would then find infinitel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more peace of mind, than you are likely ever otherwi&s;e to be acquainted with. When I look back upon the &s;weep that has been made among us in the two or three pa&s;t years, and forward upon what may &s;till hap|pen, I hardly think my&s;elf &s;ecure; tho' of late I have been guided by other lights than tho&s;e of &s;en&s;e and appe|tite, which have hurried &s;o many of our confraternity into worldly ruin, if not into eternal perdition.</P>
<P>I am very earne&s;t in my wi&s;hes to be admitted into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uptial State. But I think I ought to pa&s;s &s;ome time as a probationary, till, by &s;teadine&s;s in my good re&s;olutions, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> convince &s;ome woman, whom I could love and honour,
<PB N="395" REF="398">
and who&s;e worthy example might confirm my morals, that there is <HI>one</HI> Libertine who had the grace to reform, before Age or Di&s;ea&s;e put it out of his power to &s;in on.</P>
<P>The Harlowes continue incon&s;oleable; and I dare &s;ay will to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Howe is not yet married; but I have rea&s;on to think will &s;oon. I have the honour of corre&s;ponding with her; and the more I know of her, the more I ad|mire the noblene&s;s of her mind. She mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that &s;he is &s;uperior to half <HI>our</HI> Sex, and to mo&s;t of <HI>her own</HI>; which may make her give way to a temper naturally ha&s;ty and impatient: But, if &s;he meet with conde&s;cen&s;ion in her man (and who would not veil to a &s;uperiority &s;o vi&s;ible, if it be not exacted with arrogance?) I dare &s;ay &s;he will make an excellent wife.</P>
<P>As to Doleman, the poor man goes on trying and hoping with his Empiric. I cannot but &s;ay, that as the latter is a &s;en&s;ible and judicious man, and not ra&s;h, opinionative, or over-&s;anguine, I have great hopes (little as I think of Quacks and No&s;trum-mongers in general) that he will do him good, if his ca&s;e will admit of it. My rea&s;ons are, That the man pays a <HI>regular</HI> and <HI>con&s;tant</HI> attendance upon him: Watches, with his own eye, every change, and new &s;ymptom of his patient's malady: Varies his appli|cations as the indications vary: Fetters not him&s;elf to rules laid down by the fathers of the art, who lived many hundred years ago; when di&s;ea&s;es, and the cau&s;es of them, were different, as the modes of living were different from what they are now, as well as climates and accidents: That he is to have his reward, not in daily fees; but (af|ter the fir&s;t five guineas for medicines) in proportion as the patient him&s;elf &s;hall find amendment.</P>
<P>As to Mowbray and Tourville; what novelties can be expected, in &s;o &s;hort a time, from men, who have not &s;en&s;e enough to &s;trike o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t or pur&s;ue new lights, either good or bad?

<P>I Follow my la&s;t of the 14/25th, on occa&s;ion of a letter ju&s;t now come to hand from Jo&s;eph Leman. The fel|low is Con&s;cience-ridden, Jack; and tells me,

And I always made him believe, he tells me (<HI>poor weak &s;oul as he was from his cradle!</HI>) that &s;erving me was &s;erving both, <HI>in the long-run.</HI> But this, and the death of his dear young lady, is a grief, he declares, that he &s;hall never <HI>claw off,</HI> were he to live to the age of <HI>Matthew-Salem: Althoff,</HI> and <HI>how&s;omever,</HI> he is &s;ure, that he &s;hall not live <HI>a month to an end,</HI> being &s;trangely pined, and his &s;tomach nothing like what it was: And Mrs. Betty being al&s;o (now &s;he <HI>has got his love</HI>) very <HI>cro&s;s and &s;lighting:</HI> But, thank his God for puni&s;hing her! &s;he is in a poor way <HI>her&s;ell.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But the chief occa&s;ion of troubling my Honour now, is not his own griefs only, <HI>altho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> they are very great; but to prevent future mi&s;chiefs to me: For he can a&s;&s;ure me, that Colonel Morden has &s;et out from them all,

with a full re&s;olution to <HI>have his will of me:</HI> And he is well a&s;&s;ured, that he &s;aid, and &s;wore to it, <HI>as how</HI> he was re&s;olved that he would either have my Honour's heart's blood, or I &s;hould have his; or <HI>&s;ome &s;uch-like &s;ad threatenings:</HI> And that all the family rejoice in it, and hope I &s;hall <HI>come &s;hort home.</HI>'</Q></P>
<P>This is the &s;ub&s;tance of Jo&s;eph's letter; and I have one from Mowbray, which has a hint to the &s;ame effect. And I recollect now, that thou wert very importunate with me to go to Madrid, rather than to France and Italy, the la&s;t evening we pa&s;&s;ed together.</P>
<P>What I de&s;ire of thee, is, by the fir&s;t di&s;patch, to let me faithfully know all that thou knowe&s;t on this head.</P>
<P>I can't bear to be threatened, Jack. Nor &s;hall any man, unque&s;tioned, give him&s;elf airs in my ab&s;ence, if I know it, that &s;hall make me look mean in any-body's eyes: That &s;hall give my friends pain for me: That &s;hall put them upon wi&s;hing me to change my intentions, or my plan, to avoid him. Upon &s;uch de&s;picable terms as the&s;e, thinke&s;t thou that I could bear to live?</P>
<P>But why, if &s;uch were his purpo&s;e, did he not let me know it, before I left England? Was he unable to work him&s;elf up to a re&s;olution, till he knew me to be out of the kingdom?</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I can inform my&s;elf where to direct to him, I will write to know his purpo&s;e; for I cannot bear &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this: That &s;olemn act, were it even to be Marriage or Hanging, which mu&s;t be done to|morrow, I had rather &s;hould be done to-day. My mind tires and &s;ickens with impatience on ruminating upon &s;cenes that can afford neither variety nor certainty. To dwell twenty days in expectation of an event that may be decided in a quarter of an hour, is grievous.</P>
<P>If he come to Paris, altho' I &s;hould be on my tour, he will very ea&s;ily find out my <HI>lodgings:</HI> For I every day &s;ee &s;ome or other of my countrymen, and divers of them have I entertained <HI>here.</HI> I go frequently to the Opera, and to the Play, and appear at Court, and at all public places. And, on my quitting this city, will leave a direction whither my letter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from England, or el&s;ewhere, &s;hall from time to time be forwarded.

what Jo&s;eph Leman tells me it is, I would &s;tay here, or &s;horten his cour&s;e to me, let him be where he would.</P>
<P>I cannot get off my regrets on account of this dear Lady for the blood of me.

<P>In &s;hort, I am as much convinced that I have done wrong, as he can be; and regret it as much. But I will not bear to be threatened by any man in the world, how|ever con&s;cious of having de&s;erved blame.</P>

<P>I Cannot think, my dear Lovelace, that Colonel Mor|den has either threatened you in tho&s;e gro&s;s terms mentioned by the vile, hypocritical, and ignorant Jo&s;eph Leman, or intends to follow you. They are the words of people of that fellow's cla&s;s; and not of a gentleman: Not of Colonel Morden, I am &s;ure. You'll ob&s;erve, that Jo&s;eph pretends not to &s;ay that he heard him &s;peak them</P>
<P>I have been very &s;olicitous to &s;ound the Colonel, for your &s;ake, and for his own, and for the &s;ake of the in|junctions of the excellent lady to me, as well as to him, on that &s;ubject. He is (and you will not wonder that he &s;hould be) extremely affected; and owns, that he has ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in terms of re&s;entment on the occa&s;ion. Once he &s;aid to me, That had his beloved cou&s;in's ca&s;e been that of a common &s;eduction; and had &s;he been drawn in by what Bi&s;hop Barnet calls The Delicacy of Intrigue (her own infirmity or credulity contributing to her fall) he could have forgiven you. But, in &s;o many words, He a&s;&s;ured me, that he had not taken any re&s;olutions; nor had he declared him&s;elf to the family in &s;uch a way as &s;hould bind him to re&s;ent: On the contrary, he has owned, that
<PB N="399" REF="404">
his cou&s;in's injunctions have hitherto had the force upon him which I could wi&s;h they &s;hould have.</P>
<P>He went abroad in a week after you. When he took his leave of me, he told me, That his de&s;ign was to go to Florence; and that he would &s;ettle his affairs there; and then return to England, and here pa&s;s the remainder of his days.</P>
<P>I was indeed apprehen&s;ive that if you and he were to meet, &s;omething unhappy might fall out: And as I knew that you propo&s;ed to take Italy, and very likely Florence, in your return to France, I was very &s;olicitous to prevail upon you to take the court of Spain into your plan. I am &s;till &s;o. And if you are not to be prevailed upon to do that, let me intreat you to avoid Florence or Leghorn in your return, as you have vi&s;ited both heretofore. At lea&s;t, let not the propo&s;al of a meeting come from you.</P>
<P>It would be matter of &s;erious reflection to me, if the <HI>very fellow,</HI> this <HI>Jo&s;eph Leman,</HI> who gave you &s;uch an opportunity to turn all the artillery of his ma&s;ters again&s;t them&s;elves, and to play them upon one another to favour your plotting purpo&s;es, &s;hould be the in&s;trument in the devil's hand (unwittingly too) to avenge them all upon <HI>you:</HI> For &s;hould you even get the better of the Colonel, would the mi&s;chief end there?&mdash;It would but add remor&s;e to your pre&s;ent remor&s;e; &s;ince the interview <HI>mu&s;t</HI> end in death; for he would not, I am confident, take his life at your hand. The Harlowes would, moreover, pro&s;ecute you in a legal way. You hate <HI>them</HI>; and <HI>they</HI> would be gainers by <HI>his</HI> death: Rejoicers in yours&mdash;And have you not done mi&s;|chief enough already?</P>
<P>Let <HI>me</HI> therefore (and thro' me all your friends) have the &s;atisfaction to hear, that you are re&s;olved to avoid this gentleman. Time will &s;ubdue all things. No-body doubts your bravery. Nor will it be known, that your plan is changed thro' per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Young Harlowe talks of calling you to account. This is a plain evidence, that Mr. Morden has not taken the quarrel upon him&s;elf for their family.</P>
<P>I am in no apprehen&s;ion of any-body but Colonel Morden. I know it will not be a means to prevail upon you to oblige me, to &s;ay, that I am well a&s;&s;ured, that this gentleman is a &s;kilful &s;word&s;man; and that he is as cool
<PB N="400" REF="405">
and &s;edate as &s;kilful. But yet I will add, that if I had a value for my life, he &s;hould be the la&s;t man, except your|&s;elf, with whom I would choo&s;e to have a contention.</P>
<P>I have, as you required, been very candid and &s;incere with you. I have not aimed at palliation. If you &s;eek not Colonel Morden, it is my opinion he will not &s;eek you: For he is a man of principle. But if you &s;eek him, I believe he will not &s;hun you.</P>
<P>Let me re-urge (It is the effect of my love for you!) that you know your own guilt in this affair, and &s;hould not be again an aggre&s;&s;or. It would be pity, that &s;o brave a man as the Colonel &s;hould drop, were you and he to meet: And, on the other hand, it would be dreadful, that you &s;hould be &s;ent to your account unprepared for it; and pur&s;uing a fre&s;h violence. Moreover, &s;ee&s;t thou not, in the deaths of two of thy principal agents, the hand|writing upon the wall again&s;t thee?</P>
<P>My zeal on this occa&s;ion may make me guilty of repe|tition. Indeed I know not how to quit the &s;ubject. But if what I have written, added to your own remor&s;e and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, cannot prevail, all that I might further urge will be ineffectual.</P>
<P>Adieu therefore! May&s;t thou repent of the pa&s;t: And may no new violences add to thy heavy reflections, and overwhelm thy future hopes, is the wi&s;h of</P>

<P>I Received yours this moment, ju&s;t as I was &s;etting out for Vienna.</P>
<P>As to going to Madrid, or one &s;ingle &s;tep out of the way, to avoid Colonel Morden, let me peri&s;h, if I do!&mdash;You cannot think me &s;o mean a wretch.</P>
<P>And &s;o you own, that he <HI>has</HI> threatened me; but not in gro&s;s and ungentlemanly terms, you &s;ay. If he has threatened me like a gentleman, I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ent his threats like a gentleman. But he has not done as a man of ho|nour,
<PB N="401" REF="406">
if he has threatened me at all behind my back. I would &s;corn to threaten any man to whom I <HI>knew</HI> how to addre&s;s my&s;elf either per&s;onally or by pen and ink.</P>
<P>As to what you mention of my guilt; of the hand|writing on the wall; of a legal pro&s;ecution, if he meet his fate from my hand; of his &s;kill, coolne&s;s, courage, and &s;uch-like poltroon &s;tuff; what can you mean by it? Surely you cannot believe, that &s;uch in&s;inuations as tho&s;e will weaken either my hands or my heart.&mdash;No more of this &s;ort of non&s;en&s;e, I be&s;eech you, in any of your future letters.</P>
<P>He had not taken any re&s;olutions, you &s;ay, when you &s;aw him. He <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>will</HI> take re&s;olutions, one way or other, very quickly: for I wrote to him ye&s;terday, with|out waiting for this your an&s;wer to my la&s;t. I could not avoid it. I could not (as I told you in that) live in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e. I have directed my letter to Florence. Nor could I &s;uffer my friends to live in &s;u&s;pen&s;e as to my &s;afety or otherwi&s;e. But I have couched it in &s;uch moderate terms, that he has fairly his option. He will be the challenger, if he take it in the &s;en&s;e in which he may &s;o hand&s;omely avoid taking it. And if he does, it will demon&s;trate that ma|lice and revenge were the predominant pa&s;&s;ions with him; and that he was determined but to &s;ettle his affairs, and then <HI>take his re&s;olutions,</HI> as you phra&s;e it.&mdash;Yet, if we are to meet (for I know what <HI>my</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ption would be, in <HI>his</HI> ca&s;e, on <HI>&s;uch a letter,</HI> compla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it is) I wi&s;h <HI>he</HI> had a wor&s;e, <HI>I</HI> a better cau&s;e.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have heard, with a great deal of &s;urprize, that you have thought fit to throw out &s;ome menacing expre&s;|&s;ions again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been very glad, that you had thought I had puni&s;hment enough in my own mind, for the wrongs I have done to the mo&s;t excellent of women; and that it had been po&s;&s;ible for two per&s;ons &s;o ardently joining in one love (e&s;pecially as I was de&s;irous, to the utmo&s;t of my power, to repair tho&s;e wrongs) to have lived, if not on amicable terms, in &s;uch a way, as not to put either to the pain of hearing of threatenings thrown out in ab&s;ence, which either ought to be de&s;pi&s;ed for, if he had not &s;pirit to take notice of them.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, if what I have heard be owing only to warmth of temper, or to &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, while the lo&s;s of all other lo&s;&s;es the mo&s;t deplorable to me was recent, I not only excu&s;e, but commend you for it. But if you are really <HI>determined</HI> to meet me on any other account (which, I own to you, is not however what I wi&s;h) it would be very blameable, and very unworthy of the character I de&s;ire to
<PB N="403" REF="408">
maintain as well with you as with every other gentle|man, to give you a difficulty in doing it.</P>
<P>Being uncertain when this letter may meet you, I &s;hall &s;et out to-morrow for Vienna; where any letter directed to the po&s;t-hou&s;e in that city, or to Baron Windi&s;gratz's (at the Favorita) to whom I have commendations, will come to hand.</P>
<P>Mean time, believing you to be a man too generous to make a wrong con&s;truction of what I am going to declare, and knowing the value which the deare&s;t of all creatures had for you, and your relation&s;hip to her; I will not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ure you, that the mo&s;t acceptable return will be, that Colonel Morden choo&s;es to be upon an amicable, rather than upon any other footing, with</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter was at Florence four days before I ar|rived there.</P>
<P>That I might not appear unworthy of your &s;avour, I &s;et out for this city the very next morning. I knew not but that the politene&s;s of this court might have engaged, beyond his intention, a gentleman who has only his plea|&s;ures to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>But being di&s;appointed in my hope of finding you here, it becomes me to acquaint you, that I have &s;uch a de&s;ire to &s;tand well in the opinion of a man of your &s;pirit, that I cannot he&s;itate a moment upon the option, which I am

<P>I own, Sir, that I have, on all occa&s;ions, &s;poken of your treatment of my ever-dear cou&s;in as it de&s;erved. It would have been very &s;urpri&s;ing if I had not. And it be|hoves me (now you have given me &s;o noble an opportu|nity of explaining my&s;elf) to convince you, that no words fell from my lips, of you, merely becau&s;e you were ab&s;ent.

<P>I &s;hall &s;tay &s;ome days at this court; and if you plea&s;e to direct for me at M. Klienfurt's in this city, whether I remain here or not, your commands will come &s;afely and &s;peedily to the hands of, Sir,</P>

<P>I Have this moment the favour of yours. I will &s;u&s;pend a tour I was going to take into Hungary, and in&s;tantly &s;et out for Munich: And, if I find you not there, will proceed to Trent. This city being on the confines of Italy, will be mo&s;t convenient, as I pre&s;ume, to you, in your return to Tu&s;cany; and I &s;hall hope to meet you in it on the 13/14 of December.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Now, Jack, I have no manner of apprehen&s;ion of the event of this meeting. And I think I may &s;ay, He &s;eeks me; not I him. And &s;o let him take the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="410">What is infinitely nearer to my heart, is, my ingrati|tude to the mo&s;t excellent of women&mdash;My <HI>premeditated</HI> ingratitude!&mdash;Yet all the while enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h and to adore her excellencies, in &s;pite of the mean opinion of the Sex which I had imbibed from early manhood.</P>
<P>But this Lady has a&s;&s;erted the worthine&s;s of her Sex, and mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly has &s;he exalted it with me now. Yet, &s;urely, as I have &s;aid and written an hundred times, there cannot be &s;uch another woman.</P>
<P>But while my lo&s;s in her is the greate&s;t of any man's, and while &s;he was nearer to me, than to any other per&s;on in the world, and once &s;he her&s;elf wi&s;hed to be &s;o, what an in&s;olence in any man breathing to pretend to avenge her on <HI>me!</HI>&mdash;Happy! happy! thrice happy! had I known how to value, as I ought to have valued, the glory of &s;uch a preference!</P>
<P>I will aggravate to my&s;elf this aggravation of the Co|lonel's pretending to call me to account for my treatment of a lady &s;o much <HI>my own,</HI> le&s;t, in the approaching interview, my heart &s;hould relent for one &s;o nearly related to her, and who means honour and ju&s;tice to her memory; and I &s;hould thereby give him advantages which otherwi&s;e he cannot have. For I know that I &s;hall be inclined to tru&s;t to my &s;kill, to &s;ave a man who was &s;o much and &s;o ju&s;tly valued by her; and &s;hall be loth to give way to my re&s;entment, as a threatened man. And in this re&s;pect only am I &s;orry for his &s;kill, and his courage, le&s;t I &s;hould be obliged, in my own defence, to add a chalk to a &s;core that is already too long.</P>
<P>INDEED, indeed, Belford, I am, and &s;hall be, to my late&s;t hour, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of beings. Such exalted genero&s;ity!&mdash;Why did&s;t thou put into my craving hands the copy of her Will? Why &s;ente&s;t thou to me the po&s;thumous Letter?&mdash;What tho' I was earne&s;t to &s;ee the Will? Thou knewe&s;t what they <HI>both</HI> were (<HI>I</HI> did not); and that it would be cruel to oblige me.</P>
<P>The meeting of twenty Colonel Mordens, were there twenty to meet in turn, would be nothing to me; would not give me a moment's concern, as to my own &s;afety:
<PB N="406" REF="411">
But my reflections upon my vile ingratitude to &s;o &s;uperior an excellence will ever be my cur&s;e.</P>
<P>Had &s;he been a Mi&s;s Howe to me, and treated me as if I were an Hickman, I had had a call for revenge; and po|licy (when I had intended to be an hu&s;band) might have ju&s;tified my attempts to humble her.

extended to the Soul; and which &s;he not only avowed in her dying hours, but contrived to let me know it after death, in that Letter filled with warnings and exhorta|tions, which had for their &s;ole end my eternal welfare!</P>
<P>The cur&s;ed women, indeed, endeavoured to excite my vengeance, and my pride, by preaching to me eternally her doubts, her want of love, and her contempt of me. And my pride was, at times, too much excited by their vile in&s;inuations. But had it even been as they &s;aid; well might &s;he, who had been u&s;ed to be courted and admired by every de&s;iring eye, and wor&s;hiped by every re&s;pectful heart&mdash;Well might <HI>&s;uch</HI> a woman be allowed to draw back, when &s;he found her&s;elf kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, <HI>as to the great qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tion of all,</HI> by a de&s;igning and intriguing &s;pirit; pre|tending awe and di&s;tance, as rea&s;ons for reining-in a fer|vor, which, if real, cannot be reined-in.&mdash;Divine crea|ture! Her very doubts, her re&s;erves (&s;o ju&s;tly doubting) would have been my a&s;&s;urance, and my glory!&mdash;And what other trial needed her virtue?

<P>The&s;e reflections &s;harpened, rather than their edge by time rebated, accompany me in whatever I do, and where|ever I go; and mingle with all my diver&s;ions and amu&s;e|ments. And yet I go into gay and &s;plendid company. I have made new acquaintance in the different courts I have vi&s;ited. I am both e&s;teemed, and &s;ought after, by per&s;ons of rank and merit. I vi&s;it the colleges, the churches, the palaces. I frequent the theatre: Am pre&s;ent at every public exhibition; and &s;ee all that is worth &s;eeing, that I had not &s;een before, in the cabinets of the curious: Am &s;ometimes admitted to the toilette of an eminent toa&s;t, and make one with di&s;tinction at the a&s;&s;embl&eacute;es of others&mdash;Yet can think of nothing, nor of any-body, with delight, but of my CLARISSA. Nor have I &s;een one woman with advantage to her&s;elf, but as &s;he re&s;embles in &s;tature, air, complexion, voice, or in &s;ome feature, that charmer, that only charmer, of my &s;oul.</P>

There is no living at this rate&mdash;D&mdash;n me if there be!</P>
<P>If any mi&s;hap &s;hould befal me, you'll have the particu|lars of it from De la Tour. He indeed knows not a word of Engli&s;h: But every modern tongue is yours. He is a tru&s;ty and ingenious fellow: And, if any thing happen, will have &s;ome other papers, which I &s;hall have ready &s;ealed up, for you to tran&s;mit to Lord M.

But far otherwi&s;e. On the contrary, mo&s;t chearfully do I go to meet the Colonel; and I would tear my heart out of my brea&s;t with my own hands, were it capable of fear or concern on that account.</P>
<P>Thus much only I know, that if I &s;hould kill him (which I will not do, if I can help it) I &s;hall be far from being ea&s;y in my mind: <HI>That</HI> &s;hall I never be more. But as the meeting is evidently of his own &s;eeking, again&s;t an option fairly given to the contrary, and I cannot avoid it, I'll think of that hereafter. It is but repenting and mortify|ing for all at once: For I am as &s;ure of victory, as I am that I now live, let him be as &s;kilful a &s;word&s;man as he will: Since, be&s;ides that I am no unfle&s;hed novice, this is a &s;port, that, when provoked to it, I love as well as my food. And, moreover, I &s;hall be as <HI>calm and undi&s;turbed</HI> as the Bi&s;hop at his prayers: While he, as is evident by his let|ter, mu&s;t be actuated by revenge and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>TO-morrow is to be the Day, that will, in all proba|bility, &s;end either one or two gho&s;ts to attend the Manes of my CLARISSA.</P>
<P>I arrived here ye&s;terday; and inquiring for an Engli&s;h gentleman of the name of Morden, &s;oon found out the Colonel's lodgings. He had been in town two days; and left his name at every probable place.</P>
<P>He was gone to ride out; and I left <HI>my</HI> name, and
<PB N="410" REF="415">
where to be found: And in the evening he made me a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>He was plaguy gloomy. That was not I. But yet he told me, that I had acted like a man of true &s;pirit in my fir&s;t letter; and with honour, in giving him &s;o readily this meeting. He wi&s;hed I had in other re&s;pects; and then we might have &s;een each other upon better terms than now we did.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, there was no recalling what was pa&s;s'd; and that I wi&s;hed &s;ome things had not been done, as well as he.</P>
<P>To recriminate now, he &s;aid, would be as exa&s;perating as unavailable. And as I had &s;o chearfully given him this opportunity, words &s;hould give place to bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Your</HI> choice, Mr. Lovelace, of Time, of Place, of Weapon, &s;hall be <HI>my</HI> choice.</P>
<P>The two latter be yours, Mr. Morden. The Time to-morrow, or next day, as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Next day, then, Mr. Lovelace; and we'll ride out to-morrow, to fix the place.</P>
<P>Agreed, Sir.</P>
<P>Well; now, Mr. Lovelace, do you choo&s;e the Weapon.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I believed we might be upon an equal foot with the Single Rapier; but, if he thought otherwi&s;e, I had no objection to a Pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>I will only &s;ay, replied he, that the chances may be more equal by the Sword, becau&s;e we can neither of us be to &s;eek in that: And you'd &s;tand, &s;ays he, a wor&s;e chance, as I apprehend, with a Pi&s;tol; and yet I have brought two; that you may take your choice of either: For, add|ed he, I never mi&s;&s;ed a mark at pi&s;tol-di&s;tance, &s;ince I knew how to hold one.</P>
<P>I told him, that he &s;poke like him&s;elf: That I was ex|pert enough that way, to embrace it, if he cho&s;e it; tho' not &s;o &s;ure of my mark as he pretended to be. Yet the de|vil's in't, Colonel, if I, who have &s;lit a bullet in two upon a knife's-edge, hit not my man. So I have no objection to a Pi&s;tol, if it be <HI>your</HI> choice. No man, I'll venture to &s;ay, has a &s;teadier Hand or Eye than I have.</P>
<P>They may both be of u&s;e to you, Sir, at the Sword, as well as at the Pi&s;tol: The Sword therefore be the thing&punc; if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="416">With all my heart.</P>
<P>We parted with a &s;olemn &s;ort of ceremonious civility: And this day I called upon Him; and we rode out toge|ther to fix upon the place: And both being of one mind, and hating to put off for the morrow what could be done to-day, would have decided it then: But De la Tour, and the Colonel's valet, who attended us, being unavoidably let into the &s;ecret, joined to beg we would have with us a Surgeon from Brixen, whom La Tour had fallen in with there, and who had told him he was to ride next morn|ing to bleed a per&s;on in a fever, at a lone cottage, which, by the Surgeon's de&s;cription, was not far from the place where we then were, if it were not that very cottage within &s;ight of us.</P>
<P>They undertook &s;o to manage it, that the Surgeon &s;hould know nothing of the matter till his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was called in. And La Tour being, as I a&s;&s;ured the Colonel, a ready-contriving fellow (whom I ordered to obey him as my&s;elf were the chance to be in <HI>his</HI> favour) we both agreed to defer the deci&s;ion till to-morrow, and to leave the whole about the Surgeon to the management of our two valets; injoining them ab&s;olute &s;ecrecy: And &s;o rode back again by different ways.</P>
<P>We fixed upon a little lone valley for the Spot&mdash;Ten to-morrow morning the Time&mdash;And Single Rapier the Word. Yet I repeatedly told him, that I value my&s;elf &s;o much upon my &s;kill in that weapon, that I would wi&s;h him to choo&s;e any other.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, It was a gentleman's weapon; and he who un|der&s;tood it not, wanted a qualification that he ought to &s;uf|fer for not having: But that, as to him, one weapon was as good as another throughout all the in&s;truments of offence.</P>
<P>So, Jack, you &s;ee I take no advantage of him: But my devil mu&s;t deceive me, if he take not his life, or his death, at my hands, before eleven to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>His valet and mine are to be pre&s;ent; but both &s;trictly injoined to be impartial and inactive: And, in return for my civility of the like nature, he commanded <HI>his</HI> to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to me, if he fell.</P>
<P>We are to ride thither, and to di&s;mount when at the place; and his footman and mine are to wait at an ap|pointed

di&s;tance, with a chai&s;e to carry off to the borders of the Venetian territories the &s;urvivor, if one drop; or to a&s;&s;i&s;t either or both, as occa&s;ion may demand.</P>
<P>And thus, Belford, is the matter &s;ettled.</P>
<P>A &s;hower of rain has left me nothing el&s;e to do: And therefore I write this letter; tho' I might as well have de|ferred it till to-morrow twelve o'clock, when I doubt not to be able to write again, to a&s;&s;ure you how much I am</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Trent,</HI>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have melancholy news to inform you of, by order of the Chevalier Lovelace. He &s;hewed me his letter to you before he &s;ealed it; &s;ignifying, that he was to meet the Chevalier Morden on the 15th. Wherefore, as the occa&s;ion of the meeting is &s;o well known to you, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of it here.</P>
<P>I had taken care to have ready, within a little di&s;tance, a Surgeon and his a&s;&s;i&s;tant, to whom, under an oath of &s;ecre|cy, I had revealed the matter (tho' I did not own it to the two gentlemen); &s;o that they were prepared with band|ages, and all things proper. For well was I acquainted with the bravery and &s;kill of my Chevalier; and had heard the character of the other; and knew the animo&s;ity of both. A po&s;t-chai&s;e was ready, with each of their foot|men, at a little di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The two Chevaliers came exactly at their time: They were attended by Mon&s;ieur Margate (the colonel's gentle|man) and my&s;elf. They had given orders over-night, and now repeated them in each other's pre&s;ence, that we &s;hould ob&s;erve a &s;trict impartiality between them: And that, if one fell, each of us &s;hould look upon him&s;elf, as to any needful help, or retreat, as the &s;ervant of the &s;urvivor, and take his commands accordingly.</P>
<P>After a few compliments, both the gentlemen, with the
<PB N="413" REF="418">
greate&s;t pre&s;ence of mind that I ever beheld in men, &s;tript to their &s;hirts, and drew.</P>
<P>They parried with equal judgment &s;everal pa&s;&s;es. My Chevalier drew the fir&s;t blood, making a de&s;perate pu&s;h, which, by a &s;udden turn of his antagoni&s;t, mi&s;&s;ed going clear thro' him, and wounded him on the fle&s;hy part of the ribs of his right &s;ide; which part the &s;word tore out, being on the extremity of the body: But, before he could recover him&s;elf, his adver&s;ary, in return, pu&s;hed him into the in&s;ide of the left arm, near the &s;houlder: And the &s;word, by raking his brea&s;t as it pa&s;&s;ed, being followed by a great effu&s;ion of blood, the Colonel &s;aid, Sir, I believe you have enough.</P>
<P>My Chevalier &s;wore by G&mdash;d, he was not hurt: 'Twas a pin's point: And &s;o made another pa&s;s at his antago|ni&s;t; which he, with a &s;urpri&s;ing dexterity, received un|der his arm, and run my dear Chevalier into the body: Who immediately fell: &s;aying, The luck is your's, Sir&mdash;O my beloved Clari&s;&s;a!&mdash;Now art thou&mdash;Inwardly he &s;poke three or four words more. His &s;word dropt from his hand. Mr. Morden threw his down, and ran to him, &s;aying in French&mdash;Ah Mon&s;ieur, you are a dead man!&mdash;Call to God for mercy!</P>
<P>We gave the &s;ignal agreed upon to the footmen; and they to the Surgeons; who in&s;tantly came up.</P>
<P>Colonel Morden, I found, was too well u&s;ed to the bloody work; for he was as cool as if nothing &s;o extra|ordinary had happened, a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Surgeons, tho' his own wound bled much. But my dear Chevalier fainted away two or three times running, and vomited blood be&s;ides.</P>
<P>However, they &s;topped the bleeding for the pre&s;ent; and we helped him into the voiture; and then the Colo|nel &s;uffered his own wound to be dre&s;&s;ed; and appeared concerned that my Chevalier was between whiles (when he could &s;peak, and &s;truggle) extremely outrageous.&mdash;Poor gentleman! he had made quite &s;ure of victory!</P>
<P>The Colonel, again&s;t the Surgeons advice, would mount on hor&s;eback to pa&s;s into the Venetian territories; and generou&s;ly gave me a pur&s;e of gold to pay the Surgeons; de&s;iring me to make a pre&s;ent to the footman; and to ac|cept
<PB N="414" REF="419">
of the remainder, as a mark of his &s;atisfaction in my conduct; and in my care and tenderne&s;s of my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Surgeons told him, that my Chevalier could not live over the day.</P>
<P>When the Colonel took leave of him, Mr. Lovelace &s;aid in French, You have well revenged the dear crea|ture.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Morden, in the &s;ame language: And perhaps &s;hall be &s;orry that you called upon me to this work, while I was balancing whether to obey, or di&s;|obey, the dear angel.</P>
<P>There is a fate in it! replied my Chevalier&mdash;A cur&s;ed fate!&mdash;Or this could not have been!&mdash;But be ye all wit|ne&s;&s;es, that I have provoked my de&s;tiny, and acknowlege, that I fall by a Man of Honour.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the Colonel, with the piety of a confe&s;&s;or, (wringing Mr. Lovelace's hand) &s;natch the&s;e few fleet|ing moments, and commend your&s;elf to God.</P>
<P>And &s;o he rode off.</P>
<P>The voiture proceeded &s;lowly with my Chevalier; yet the motion &s;et both his wounds bleeding afre&s;h; and it was with difficulty they again &s;topped the blood.</P>
<P>We brought him alive to the fir&s;t cottage; and he gave orders to me to di&s;patch to you the pacquet I herewith &s;end &s;ealed up; and bid me write to you the particulars of this mo&s;t unhappy affair, and to give you thanks, in his name, for all your favours and friend&s;hip to him.</P>
<P>Contrary to all expectation, he lived over the night: But &s;uffered much, as well from his impatience and di&s;ap|pointment, as from his wounds; for he &s;eemed very un|willing to die.</P>
<P>He was delirious, at times, in the two la&s;t hours; and then &s;everal times cried out, Take her away! Take her away! but named no-body. And &s;ometimes prai&s;ed &s;ome Lady (that Clari&s;&s;a, I &s;uppo&s;e, whom he had called upon when he received his death's wound) calling her, Sweet Excellence! Divine Creature! Fair Sufferer!&mdash;And once he &s;aid, Look down, ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, look down!&mdash;And there &s;topt;&mdash;his lips however moving.</P>
<P>At nine in the morning, he was &s;eized with convul&s;ions, and fainted away; and it was a quarter of an hour before he came out of them.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="420">His few la&s;t words I mu&s;t not omit, as they &s;hew an ultimate compo&s;ure; which may admini&s;ter &s;ome con&s;o|lation to his honourable friends.</P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI>&mdash;&s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf no doubt to Heaven; for his dying eyes were lifted up&mdash;A &s;trong convul&s;ion prevented him for a few moments &s;aying more&mdash;But re|covering, he again with great fervor (lifting up his eyes, and his &s;pread hands) pronounced the word <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed:</HI>&mdash;Then, in a &s;eeming ejaculation, he &s;poke inwardly &s;o as not to be under&s;tood: At la&s;t, he di&s;tinctly pronounced the&s;e three words,
<Q>LET THIS EXPIATE!</Q>
And then, his head &s;inking on his pillow, he expired; at about half an hour after ten.</P>
<P>He little thought, poor gentleman! his End &s;o near: So had given no direction about his body. I have cau&s;ed it to be embowelled, and depo&s;ited in a vault, till I have orders from England.</P>
<P>This is a favour that was procured with difficulty; and would have been refu&s;ed, had he not been an Engli&s;hman of rank: A nation with rea&s;on re&s;pected in every Au&s;trian government&mdash;For he had refu&s;ed gho&s;tly attendance, and the Sacraments in the Catholic way. May his Soul be happy, I pray God!</P>
<P>I have had &s;ome trouble al&s;o on account of the man|ner of his death, from the Magi&s;tracy here: Who have taken the requi&s;ite informations in the affair. And it has co&s;t me &s;ome money. Of which, and of my dear Cheva|lier's effects, I will give you a faithful account in my next. And &s;o, waiting at this place your commands, I am, SIR,</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Suppo&s;ed to be written by Mr. BELFORD.</BYLINE>
<P>WHAT remains to be mentioned for the &s;ati&s;|faction of &s;uch of the readers as may be pre|&s;umed to have intere&s;ted them&s;elves in the for|tunes of tho&s;e other principals in the &s;tory, who &s;urvived Mr. Lovelace, will be found &s;ummarily related as fol|lows:</P>
<P>The news of Mr. LOVELACE's unhappy End was re|ceived with as much grief by his own relations, as it was with exultation by the Harlowe-family, and by Mi&s;s Howe. His own family were <HI>mo&s;t</HI> to be pitied, becau&s;e, being &s;in|cere admirers of the inimitable Lady, they were great|ly grieved for the inju&s;tice done her; and now had the <HI>additional</HI> mortification of lo&s;ing the only male of it, by a violent death.</P>
<P>That his fate was de&s;erved, was &s;till a heightening of their calamity, as they had, for that very rea&s;on, and his un|preparedne&s;s for it, but too much grounds for apprehen|&s;ion with regard to his future happine&s;s. While the other family, from their unforgiving &s;pirit, and even the noble young Lady above-mentioned, from her lively re&s;entments, &s;ound his death &s;ome little, &s;ome temporary, alleviation of the heavy lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained, principally thro' his means.</P>
<P><HI>Temporary alleviation,</HI> we repeat, as to the Harlowe fa|mily; for THEY were far from being happy or ea&s;y in their reflections upon their own conduct.</P>
<P>Mrs. HARLOWE lived about two years and an half after the much-lamented death of her excellent daughter.</P>
<P>Mr. HARLOWE &s;urvived his Lady about half a year.</P>
<P><PB N="417" REF="422">BOTH, in their la&s;t hours, comforted them&s;elves, that they &s;hould be re&s;tored to their BLESSED daughter, as they always (from the time that they were acquainted with her happy <HI>exit</HI>) called her.</P>
<P>They both lived, however, to &s;ee their &s;on <HI>James,</HI> and their daughter <HI>Arabella,</HI> married: But not to take joy in either of their nuptials.</P>
<P>Mr. JAMES HARLOWE married a woman of family, an orphan, and is obliged, at a very great expence, to &s;upport her claim to e&s;tates, which were his principal in|ducement to make his addre&s;&s;es to her; but which, to this day, he has not recovered; nor is likely to recover; hav|ing very powerful adver&s;aries to contend with, and a Title to a&s;&s;ert, which admits of litigation; and he not ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o much patience as is nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;ons embar|ra&s;&s;ed in Law.</P>
<P>What is further ob&s;ervable with regard to him, is, that the match was intirely of his own head, again&s;t the ad|vice of his father, mother, and uncles, who warned him of marrying in this lady a Law-&s;uit for life. His unge|nerous behaviour to his wi&s;e, for what &s;he cannot help, and for what is as much her misfortune as his, has occa|&s;ioned &s;uch e&s;trangements between them (&s;he being a wo|man of &s;pirit) as, were the Law-&s;uits determined, and even more favourably than probably they will be, mu&s;t make him unhappy to the End of his Life. He attributes all his misfortunes, when he opens him&s;elf to the <HI>few</HI> friends he has, to his vile and cruel treatment of his angelic &s;i&s;ter. He confe&s;&s;es the&s;e misfortunes to be ju&s;t, without having temper to acquie&s;ce in the acknowleged ju&s;tice. One month in every year he puts on mourning, and that month commences with him on the 7th of September, during which he &s;huts him&s;elf up from all company. Finally, he is looked upon, and often calls him&s;elf. THE MOST MISERABLE OF BEINGS.</P>
<P>ARABELLA's Fortune became a temptation to a man of Quality to make his addre&s;&s;es to her: His Title an in|ducement with her to approve of him. Brothers and Si&s;ters, when they are not Friends, are generally the &s;harpe&s;t Ene|mies to each other. He thought too much was done for her in the &s;ettlements. She thought not enough. And
<PB N="418" REF="423">
for &s;ome years pa&s;t, they have &s;o heartily hated each other, that if either know a joy, it is in being told of &s;ome new misfortune or di&s;plea&s;ure that happens to the other. Indeed, before they came to an open rupture, they were continually loading each other, by way of exonerating them&s;elves (<HI>to the additional di&s;quiet of the whole family</HI>) with the <HI>principal</HI> guilt of their implacable behaviour and &s;ordid cruelty to their admirable Si&s;ter.&mdash;May the reports that are &s;pread of this Lady's further unhappine&s;s from her Lord's free life; a fault &s;he <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> thought &s;o odious in Mr. Lovelace (though that would not have been an in|&s;uperable objection with her to his addre&s;&s;es); and of his public &s;lights and contempt of her, and even &s;ometimes of his <HI>per&s;onal abu&s;es,</HI> which are &s;aid to be owing to her im|patient &s;pirit, and violent pa&s;&s;ions; be utterly groundle&s;s.&mdash;For, what a heart mu&s;t that be, which would wi&s;h &s;he might be as great a torment to her&s;elf, as &s;he had aimed to be to her Si&s;ter? E&s;pecially as &s;he regrets to this hour, and declares, that &s;he &s;hall to the la&s;t of her life, her cruel treatment of that Si&s;ter; and (as well as her Brother) is but too ready to attribute to <HI>that</HI> her own unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. ANTONY and Mr. JOHN HARLOWE are &s;till [at the writing of this] living: But often declare, That, with their beloved niece, they lo&s;t all the joy of their lives: And lament, without re&s;erve, in all companies, the unna|tural part they were induced to take again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Mr. SOLMES is al&s;o &s;till living, if a man of his ca&s;t may be &s;aid to live; for his general behaviour and &s;ordid man|ners are &s;uch as ju&s;tify the aver&s;ion the excellent Lady had to him. He has moreover found his addre&s;&s;es rejected by &s;everal women of far inferior fortunes (great as his own are) to tho&s;e of the Lady to whom he was encouraged to a&s;pire.</P>
<P>Mr. MOWBRAY and Mr. TOURVILLE having lo&s;t the man in who&s;e conver&s;ation they &s;o much delighted; &s;hock'd and awakened by the &s;everal unhappy cata&s;tro|phes before their eyes; and having always rather <HI>ductile</HI> than <HI>dictating</HI> hearts; took their friend Belford's advice: Converted the remainder of their fortunes into Annuities for Life; and retired, the one into York&s;hire, the other into Nottingham&s;hire, of which counties they are natives:
<PB N="419" REF="424">
Their friend Belford managing their concerns for them, and corre&s;ponding with them, and having more and more hopes every time he &s;ees them (which is once or twice a year, when they come to town) that they will become more and more worthy of their names and families.</P>
<P>It cannot be ami&s;s to mention what became of the two &s;i&s;ters in iniquity, <HI>Sally Martin,</HI> and <HI>Polly Horton</HI>; names &s;o frequently occurring in the foregoing collection.</P>
<P>After the death of the profligate Sinclair, they kept on the infamous trade with too-much &s;ucce&s;s; till an acci|dent happened in the hou&s;e&mdash;A gentleman of family killed in it in a fray, contending with another for a new-vamp'd face. Sally was accu&s;ed of holding the gentle|man's arm, while his more favoured adver&s;ary run him through the heart, and then made off. And &s;he being try'd for her life, narrowly e&s;caped.</P>
<P>This accident obliged them to break up hou&s;e-keep|ing, and not having been frugal enough of their ill-gotten gains (lavi&s;hing upon one, what they got by another) they were compelled, for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence-&s;ake, to enter them|&s;elves as under-managers at &s;uch another hou&s;e as their own had been.

<P>She laid out the greate&s;t part of her time in doing good by her advice, and by the prudent management of the Fund committed to her direction. Having lived an Ex|emplary Life from her Youth upwards; and &s;een her Son happily &s;ettled in the world; &s;he departed with ea&s;e and calmne&s;s, without pang or agony, like a tired traveller, falling into a &s;weet &s;lumber: Her la&s;t words expre&s;&s;ing her hope of being re&s;tored to the Child of her Bo&s;om; and to her own excellent Father and Mother, to who&s;e care and pains &s;he owed that good Education to which &s;he was in|debted for all her other ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>The Poor's Fund, which was committed to her care, &s;he re&s;igned, a week before her death, into the hands of Mrs. Hickman, according to the direction of the Will, and all the accounts and di&s;bur&s;ements with it; which &s;he had kept with &s;uch an exactne&s;s, that that Lady declares, that &s;he will follow her method, and only wi&s;hes to do as well.</P>

<P>And &s;till the more highly does &s;he e&s;teem and love him, as &s;he reflects upon his pa&s;t kindne&s;s to her beloved friend; and on that dear friend's good opinion of him.

<P>With regard to the Tru&s;t with which he was honoured by the inimitable Lady, he had the plea&s;ure of acquitting him&s;elf of it in a very few months, to every-body's &s;ati&s;|faction; even to that of the unhappy family; who &s;ent him their thanks on the occa&s;ion.

<P>There was but one Earthly Ble&s;&s;ing which remained for Mr. Belford to wi&s;h for, in order, morally &s;peaking, to &s;ecure to him all his other ble&s;&s;ings; and that was, the greate&s;t of all worldly ones, a virtuous and prudent Wife.

<P>Lord M. added bountifully in his life-time, as did al&s;o the two Ladies his Si&s;ters, to the fortune of their worthy Niece. And as Mr. Belford has been ble&s;&s;ed with a Son by her, his Lord&s;hip at his death (which happened ju&s;t three years after the untimely one of his unhappy Nephew) was plea&s;ed to devi&s;e to that Son, and to his de&s;cendants for ever (and in ca&s;e of his death unmarried, to any other children of his Niece) his Hertford&s;hire e&s;tate (<HI>de&s;igned for Mr. Lovelace</HI>) which he made up to the value of a moiety of his real e&s;tates; bequeathing al&s;o a moiety of his per&s;onal to the &s;ame Lady.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the foregoing Work has been favoured, in the cour&s;e of its Publication, with many Anonymous Letters, in which the Writers have <HI>differently</HI> expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;hes as to what they apprehended of the Cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e directed to him by the gentler Sex turn in favour of what they call a <HI>fortunate Ending</HI>; and &s;ome of them, enamoured, as they declare, with the principal Character, are warmly &s;olicitous to have her <HI>happy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Letters having been written on the peru&s;al of the fir&s;t Four Volumes only, before the complicated adju&s;tment of the &s;everal parts to one another could be &s;een, or fully known, it may be thought &s;uperfluous, now the whole Work is before the Public, to enter up|on this argument, becau&s;e it is pre&s;umed, that the Ca|ta&s;trophe nece&s;&s;arily follows the natural progre&s;s of the Story: But as the Notion of <HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice</HI> &s;eems to have generally obtained among the Fair Sex, and mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to have the appearance of Good Nature and Humanity, it may not be ami&s;s to give it a brief con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>No can it be deemed impertinent to touch upon this &s;ubject at the Conclu&s;ion of a Work which is de&s;igned to inculcate upon the human mind, under the gui&s;e of an Amu&s;ement, the great Le&s;&s;ons of Chri&s;tianity, in an Age <HI>like the pre&s;ent;</HI> which &s;eems to expect from the Poets and Dramatic Writers (that is to &s;ay, from the Authors of Works of Invention) that they &s;hould make it one of their principal Rules, to propagate another Sort of Di&s;|pen&s;ation, under the Name of <HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice,</HI> than that with which God, by Revelation, teaches us, he has

thought fit to exerci&s;e Mankind; whom, placing here only in a State of <HI>Probation,</HI> he hath &s;o intermingled Good and Evil, as to nece&s;&s;itate them to look forward for a more equal Di&s;tribution of both.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory, or rather, The Dramatic Narrative of CLARISSA, is formed on this Religious Plan; and is therefore well ju&s;tified in deferring to extricate &s;uffering Virtue till it meets with the Completion of its Reward.</P>
<P>But we have no need to &s;helter our Conduct under the Sanction of Religion (an Authority, perhaps, not of the greate&s;t weight with modern Critics) &s;ince we are ju&s;tified in it by the greate&s;t Ma&s;ter of Rea&s;on, and the be&s;t Judge of Compo&s;ition, that ever was.

<P>The&s;e are the great Authorities &s;o favourable to the Stories that end unhappily: Yet the Writer of the Hi&s;tory of Clari&s;&s;a is humbly of Opinion, that he might have been excu&s;ed referring to them for the vindication of <HI>his</HI> Cata&s;trophe, even by tho&s;e who are advocates for the contrary opinion; &s;ince the notion of <HI>Poetical Ju&s;tice,</HI> founded on the <HI>Modern Rules,</HI> has hardly ever been more &s;trictly ob&s;erved in works of this nature, than in the pre&s;ent performance, if any regard at all be to be paid to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem,</HI> on which it is formed.</P>
<P>For, Is not Mr. <HI>Lovelace,</HI> who could per&s;evere in his villainous views, again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t fre|quent convictions and remor&s;es that ever were &s;ent to awaken and reclaim a wicked man&mdash;Is not this great, this wilful Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, condignly <HI>puni&s;hed</HI>; and his puni&s;hment brought on thro' the intelligence of the very Jo&s;eph Leman whom he had corrupted <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Vol.</HI> vii. <HI>p.</HI> 396&mdash;399.</NOTE>; and by means of the very women whom he had debauched <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. <HI>409.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;Is not Mr. <HI>Belton,</HI> who has an uncle's <HI>ha&s;tened</HI> death to an&s;wer for <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. <HI>31.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;Are not the <HI>whole Harlowe family</HI>&mdash;Is not the vile <HI>Tomlin&s;on</HI>&mdash;Are not the infamous <HI>Sinclair,</HI> and her <HI>wretched Partners</HI>&mdash;And even the wicked <HI>Ser|vants,</HI> who, with their eyes open, contributed their parts to the carrying on of the vile &s;chemes of their re&s;pective principals&mdash;<HI>Are they not All likewi&s;e exem|plarily puni&s;hed?</HI></P>

<P>The Length of the piece has been objected to by &s;ome, who had &s;een only the fir&s;t four Volumes, and who perhaps looked upon it as a mere <HI>Novel</HI> or <HI>Romance</HI>; and yet of <HI>the&s;e</HI> there are not wanting works of equal length.</P>
<P>They were of opinion, that the Story moved too &s;lowly, particuarly in the fir&s;t and &s;econd Volumes, which are chiefly taken up with the Altercations between Clari&s;&s;a and the &s;everal per&s;ons of her Family.</P>
<P>But is it not true, that tho&s;e Altercations are the Foundation of the whole, and therefore a nece&s;&s;ary part of the work? The Letters and Conver&s;ations, where the Story makes the &s;lowe&s;t progre&s;s, are pre&s;umed to be <HI>characteri&s;tic.</HI> They give occa&s;ion likewi&s;e to &s;ugge&s;t many intere&s;ting <HI>Per&s;onalities,</HI> in which a good deal of the In&s;truction e&s;&s;ential to a work of this nature, is con|veyed. And it will, moreover, be remembred, that the Author at his fir&s;t &s;etting out, appri&s;ed the Reader, that the Story was to be looked upon as the Vehicle only to the In&s;truction.</P>
<P>To all which we may add, that there was frequently a nece&s;&s;ity to be very circum&s;tantial and minute, in order to pre&s;erve and main<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain that Air of Probability, which is nece&s;&s;ary to be maintained in a Story de&s;igned to repre|&s;ent real Life; and which is rendered extremely bu&s;y and
<PB N="432" REF="437">
active by the plots and contrivances formed and carried on by one of the principal Characters.</P>
<P>In a word. <HI>If,</HI> in the Hi&s;tory before us, it &s;hall be found, that the Spirit is duly diffu&s;ed throughout; that the Characters are various and natural; well di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, and uniformly &s;upported and maintained: <HI>If</HI> there be a variety of incidents &s;ufficient to excite Attention, and tho&s;e &s;o conducted, as to keep the Reader always awake; the Length then mu&s;t add proportionably to the plea&s;ure that every Per&s;on of Ta&s;te receives from a well-drawn Picture of Nature. But where the contrary of all the&s;e qualities &s;hock the under&s;tanding, the extrava|gant performance will be judged tedious, tho' no longer than a Fairy-Tale.</P>
