<P>THOUGH I look upon this Poem, in point of ele|vation of diction and &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, to be as highly heroical, as my Epi&s;tle to Sir William Chambers, yet I have not thought proper to add that epithet to it on the title-page. I am willing to wi&s;h that fir&s;t production of my mu&s;e may pre&s;erve the di|&s;tinction which it now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, of being called <HI>The</HI> He|roic Epi&s;tle, <HI>par excellence.</HI> Be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, the different ranks of the two per&s;ons, to whom the&s;e two works are addre&s;&s;ed, require a difference to be made in this matter; and it would be unpardonable in me not to di&s;criminate between a Comptroller of his Maje&s;ty's Works, and the Hackney Scribbler of a New&s;paper; between a Placeman and a Pen&s;ioner, a Knight of the Polar Star, and a broken Apothecary.</P>

Two or three years ago this gentleman found him&s;elf libelled in a new&s;paper; and on &s;u&s;pecting a certain clergyman to be the author, he wrote a fir&s;t canto of a poem, called The Prie&s;t Di&s;&s;ected, in which he prepared all chirurgical matters previous to the operation. In the mean time the par&s;on proved an <HI>alibi,</HI> and &s;aved his bacon. To this fir&s;t and unique canto the author prefixed a &s;omething in which he exculpated him&s;elf from being the author of the Heroic Epi&s;tle, which it &s;eems had been laid to his charge during the time the clan of Macgreggors continued without a name, and which, as the world well knows, was the only rea&s;on which prevented me from claiming the merit of that production. It is to this &s;omething, that the latter part of the line alludes. For in it he had told the public, that his Maje&s;ty had ten children, which it knew very well before. Hence the epithet <HI>well-known.</HI></P>
