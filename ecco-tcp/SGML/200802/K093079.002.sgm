<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITTEN 1766. ADDRESSED TO THE EARL OF CHATHAM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AMIDST the more important toils of &s;tate,</L>
<L>The coun&s;els labouring in thy patriot &s;oul,</L>
<L>Tho' Europe from thy voice expect her fate,</L>
<L>And thy keen glance extend from pole to pole;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Chatham, nurs'd in ancient Virtue's lore,</L>
<L>To the&s;e &s;ad &s;trains incline a favouring ear;</L>
<L>Think on the God, whom thou, and I adore,</L>
<L>Nor turn unpitying from the poor man's prayer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah me! how ble&s;t was once a pea&s;ant's life!</L>
<L>No lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion &s;well'd my even brea&s;t;</L>
<L>Far from the &s;tormy waves of civil &s;trife,</L>
<L>Sound were my &s;lumbers, and my heart at re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="268" REF="270">
<L>I ne'er for guilty, painful plea&s;ures rov'd,</L>
<L>But taught by Nature, and by choice to wed,</L>
<L>From all the hamlet cull'd whom be&s;t I lov'd,</L>
<L>With her I &s;taid my heart, with her my bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To gild her worth I a&s;k'd no wealthy power,</L>
<L>My toil could feed her, and my arm defend;</L>
<L>In youth, or age, in pain, or plea&s;ure's hour,</L>
<L>The &s;ame fond hu&s;band, father, brother, friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;he, the faithful partner of my care,</L>
<L>When ruddy evening &s;treak'd the we&s;tern &s;ky,</L>
<L>Look'd towards the uplands, if her mate was there,</L>
<L>Or thro' the beech-wood ca&s;t an anxious eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, careful matron, heap'd the maple board</L>
<L>With &s;avoury herbs, and pick'd the nicer part</L>
<L>From &s;uch plain food as Nature could afford,</L>
<L>Ere &s;imple Nature was debauch'd by Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While I, contented with my homely cheer,</L>
<L>Saw round my knees my prattling children play;</L>
<L>And oft with pleas'd attention &s;at to hear</L>
<L>The little hi&s;tory of their idle day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But ah! how chang'd the &s;cene! On the cold &s;tones,</L>
<L>Where wont at night to blaze the chearful fire,</L>
<L>Pale Famine &s;its and counts her naked bones,</L>
<L>Still &s;ighs for food, &s;till pines with vain de&s;ire.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="269" REF="271">
<L>My faithful wife with ever-&s;treaming eyes</L>
<L>Hangs on my bo&s;om her dejected head;</L>
<L>My helple&s;s infants rai&s;e their feeble cries,</L>
<L>And from their father claim their daily bread.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear tender pledges of my hone&s;t love,</L>
<L>On that bare bed behold your brother lie;</L>
<L>Three tedious days with pinching want he &s;trove,</L>
<L>The fourth, I &s;aw the helple&s;s cherub die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor long &s;hall ye remain. With vi&s;age &s;our</L>
<L>Our tyrant lord commands us from our home;</L>
<L>And arm'd with cruel Law's coercive power,</L>
<L>Bids me and mine o'er barren mountains roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet never, Chatham, have I pa&s;s'd a day</L>
<L>In Riot's orgies, or in idle ea&s;e;</L>
<L>Ne'er have I &s;acrific'd to &s;port and play,</L>
<L>Or wi&s;h'd a pamper'd appetite to plea&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard was my fare, and con&s;tant was my toil,</L>
<L>Still with the morning's orient light I ro&s;e,</L>
<L>Fell'd the &s;tout oak, or rais'd the lofty pile,</L>
<L>Parch'd in the &s;un, in dark December froze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is it that Nature with a niggard hand</L>
<L>Witholds her gifts from the&s;e once favour'd plains?</L>
<L>Has God, in vengeance to a guilty land,</L>
<L>Sent Dearth and Famine to her labouring &s;wains?</L>
</LG>

<PB N="270" REF="272">
<L>Ah no; yon hill, where daily &s;weats my brow,</L>
<L>A thou&s;and flocks, a thou&s;and herds adorn;</L>
<L>Yon field, where late I drove the painful plow,</L>
<L>Feels all her acres crown'd with wavy corn.</L>
</LG>

<L>But what avails that o'er the furrow'd &s;oil</L>
<L>In Autumn's heat the yellow harve&s;ts ri&s;e,</L>
<L>If artificial want elude my toil,</L>
<L>Unta&s;ted plenty wound my craving eyes?</L>

<L>If &s;till the griping cormorants withold</L>
<L>The fruits which rain and genial &s;ea&s;ons &s;end?</L>

<LG>
<L>If tho&s;e fell vipers of the public weal</L>
<L>Yet unrelenting on our bowels prey;</L>
<L>If &s;till the cur&s;e of penury we feel,</L>
<L>And in the mid&s;t of plenty pine away?</L>

<L>Once more with out-&s;trecth'd arm thy Britons &s;ave;</L>

<L>Alphon, no more to Lycas now remains,</L>

<L>Even now nine days, and nine revolving nights</L>

<L>And deep immers'd beneath its whirling wave.</L>
<L>I wak'd at early dawn, and to the field</L>

<L>With ripening corn, of all their charms de&s;poil'd,</L>
