<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BIOGRAPHERS, in the pur&s;uit of infor|mation, are naturally betrayed into mi|nute re&s;earches. The curio&s;ity of the reader is &s;eldom proportioned to that of the writer in this &s;pecies of compo&s;ition. Every inci|dent, relating to a favourite character which the mind has long contemplated with atten|tion, acquires importance. On the&s;e prin|ciples we may venture to found a plau&s;ible excu&s;e, for the many trifling di&s;coveries, and intricate di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of in&s;ignificant circum|&s;tances, with which per&s;onal hi&s;tory &s;o much abounds.</P>
<P>To this apology, which every biographer has a right to plead, the writer of the fol|lowing memoirs pre&s;umes he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a pe|culiar
<PB N="4" REF="3">
claim, ari&s;ing from his &s;ituation and connections. He de&s;cribes the life of a per|&s;on, whom the &s;tronge&s;t principles of grati|tude, implanted in early years, have habitu|ally taught him to regard with united vene|ration and affection. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, the &s;lighte&s;t events appear intere&s;ting; and the mo&s;t frivolous anecdotes of &s;uch a life are inve&s;tigated with a plea&s;ing enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>In the mean time, a want of materials might have ju&s;tly been here alledged, in ex|tenuation of an objection &s;o con&s;tantly urged again&s;t works of this kind. It will readily be granted, that to record the lives of men who have adorned their country by monu|ments of munificence, is a tribute indi&s;pen&s;|ably due to public merit, and which cannot without public inju&s;tice be witheld. But to di&s;charge this duty even imperfectly, and by tho&s;e means, however inadequate, which the utmo&s;t exertions of diligent enquiry can afford, is le&s;s unpardonable than to neglect
<PB N="5" REF="4">
it entirely. When we cannot recover a per|fect portrait of our friend and our benefactor, we mu&s;t be contented with a few faint out|lines. Abundance only implies rejection; and where but little can be collected, it is nece&s;&s;ary to retain every thing. We mu&s;t ac|quie&s;ce in anecdotes of incon&s;iderable con&s;e|quence, while tho&s;e of more importance can|not be procured.</P>
<P>The&s;e inconveniencies might have ea&s;ily been prevented. But our ance&s;tors had no regard for futurity. They tru&s;ted the re|membrances of their heroes to chance and tradition; or rather, to the laborious in|ve&s;tigation of a di&s;tant po&s;terity. For it is the ta&s;k of modern times to commemorate, if they cannot imitate, the con&s;picuous ex|amples of antiquity; and to compo&s;e the panegyric of tho&s;e virtues which exi&s;t no more. Inqui&s;itive lei&s;ure is not the lot of earlier eras. Ages of action are &s;ucceeded by ages of enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
But that &s;pecies of enquiry which properly belongs to the biographer, &s;eems, in point of time, to be po&s;teriour to that which forms the province of the hi&s;torian. It does not grow fa&s;hionable till late: it begins to be the favourite amu&s;ement of cultivated na|tions at their mo&s;t poli&s;hed periods. When the more important and exten&s;ive &s;tores of hi&s;torical information have been exhau&s;ted, the growing &s;pirit of curio&s;ity, which in|crea&s;es in proportion as it is gratified, &s;till demands new gratifications; it de&s;cends to particularities, and delights to develope cir|cum&s;tances of a &s;ubordinate nature. After many general hi&s;tories have been written, inqui&s;itive minds are eager to explore the parts of what they have hitherto &s;urveyed at large. The ardour of re&s;earch, which gathers &s;trength from contraction, is exerted on di&s;|tinct periods; and at length per&s;onal hi&s;tory commences. Characters before only repre|&s;ented in the gro&s;s, and but incidentally ex|hibited
<PB N="7" REF="6">
or &s;uperficially di&s;played, now be|come the &s;ubject of critical di&s;qui&s;ition, and a &s;eparate examination. Occurences neglect|ed or omitted by the hi&s;torian, form mate|rials for the biographer: and men of &s;upe|riour eminence are &s;elected from the common ma&s;s of public tran&s;actions in which they were indi&s;tinctly grouped, and delineated as detatched figures in a &s;ingle point of view.</P>
<P>Nor was it till late after the re&s;toration of literature, that biography a&s;&s;umed its proper form, and appeared in its genuine character. The Lives which were compiled at &s;ome di&s;|tance after that period, are extremely jejune and defective performances. The fir&s;t which approached to perfection were tho&s;e of Pei|re&s;kius, by Peter Ga&s;&s;endus, and of Melanc|thon, by Camerarius. It was long, before the per&s;everance of inve&s;tigation connected with preci&s;ion, the patient toil of tracing evi|dences, authenticating facts, and dige&s;ting &s;cattered notices, grew into a &s;cience: in a
<PB N="8" REF="7">
word, before the accuracy of the antiquarian was engrafted on the re&s;earches of the bio|grapher. The ma&s;terly Life of William of Wykeham will be&s;t explain and illu&s;trate the&s;e reflections: a work which I chu&s;e to produce as an example on this occa&s;ion, not only becau&s;e it is here produced as an ex|ample with a peculiar degree of propriety, but becau&s;e it is a pattern of that excellence in this mode of writing, which I mean to characteri&s;e and recommend.</P>
<P>As &s;ir Thomas Pope bore &s;ome &s;hare in the national tran&s;actions of his time, to re|lieve the dryne&s;s of per&s;onal and local inci|dents, I have endeavoured to render the&s;e pages in &s;ome mea&s;ure intere&s;ting to general readers, by dilating this part of my perform|ance, and by &s;ometimes introducing hi&s;torical digre&s;&s;ions, yet re&s;ulting immediately from the tenour of my &s;ubject. Among&s;t the&s;e, I flatter my&s;elf that my relation of the per&s;e|cutions of the prince&s;s Elizabeth may merit
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;ome attention: of which I have thrown together a more uniform and circum&s;tantial detail than has yet appeared, with the ad|dition of &s;everal anecdotes re&s;pecting that tran&s;action not hitherto publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the whole I may venture to affirm, that I have at lea&s;t attempted to make my work as entertaining as po&s;&s;ible. My materials have not always been of the mo&s;t brilliant kind; but they are &s;uch, as have often enabled me to enliven and embelli&s;h my narrative by pre|&s;enting pictures of antient manners, which are ever &s;triking to the imagination.</P>
<P>I have before hinted, that my re&s;ources for compiling this hi&s;tory were &s;lender and in|&s;ufficient. From books I could obtain &s;carce any information. Indeed, my chief a&s;&s;i&s;|tance has been derived from manu&s;cript au|thorities. I have not however in this re&s;pect found the &s;ucce&s;s I wi&s;hed. Yet I have carefully con&s;ulted every record that &s;eemed
<PB N="10" REF="9">
likely to illu&s;trate my &s;ubject; and my refe|rences will &s;hew, that I have &s;earched a variety of authentic in&s;truments, pre&s;erved in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, the chapel of the Rolls, and other repo&s;itories of valuable originals. Of the&s;e the more important are printed at large in the Appendix.</P>
<P>Among my references to manu&s;cript au|thorities, two &s;ometimes occur which require explanation. The&s;e are, <HI>MSS. Cotton. Vitel|lius,</HI> F. 5. <HI>MSS. Strype.</HI> And, <HI>MSS. F. Wi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1709, that indu&s;trious and ac|curate annali&s;t Mr. John Strype, communi|cated to doctor Arthur Charlett, ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity college, originally fellow of Tri|nity college, an account of the Funeral of &s;ir Thomas Pope<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Ballard's Coll. of Letters, MSS. Bibl. Bodl. fol. xv. pag. 31. Letter from Strype to Charlett, dated Lowlayton, E&s;&s;ex, Apr. 20. 1709. See LIFE, infr. p. 178.</NOTE>. This account Strype had tran&s;cribed from a manu&s;cript of the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
Cotton library, which he perpetually cites in in his ECCLESIASTICAL MEMOIRS, marked <HI>Vitellius,</HI> F. 5<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In a letter from Strype to Charlett, dat. ibid. Apr. 5. 1709.

Yet it occurs to me, that &s;ir THOMAS POPE's Funeral, with the time and place, as al&s;o the re&s;t of pages 30, 31, [viz.] the funerals in tho&s;e pages mentioned, were taken from the volume, VITELLIUS F. 5. in the Cotton library, which is a certain brief journal of funeral<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, and as well of divers other occurrences, begin|ning at the year 1550, written, as it &s;eems, by &s;ome herald, or other diligent ob&s;erver of his own times. There the writer &s;ets down all the particular ceremonies, the &s;olemnities, and mourners, at that knight's interment. Which if you have any de&s;ire to know, I will tran&s;cribe out of my notes and &s;end you."</Q> This is an original. Then follows the letter be|fore referred to, which is not the original, but a tran&s;cript by the late Mr. Rawlins of Pophills in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, who be|came po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Charlett's exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence. See AP|PEND. p. 458. infr.</NOTE>. Soon afterwards it appears that Strype &s;ent to Charlett, perhaps at his reque&s;t, a few other notices relating to &s;ir Thomas Pope, extracted from the &s;ame manu&s;cript.
<PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y">
The late learned Mr Francis Wi&s;e, keeper of the archives, Radclivian librarian, and fellow of Trinity college, at Oxford, copied all the tran&s;cripts, about four or five in num|ber, which Strype on this occa&s;ion had made from the Cotton manu&s;cript, by per|mi&s;&s;ion of Charlett, among who&s;e curious and numerous papers they were kept; and by Mr. Wi&s;e they were thus communicated to me. Fortunately for the pre&s;ent underta|king, the extracts had been made by Strype before the fire happened in the Cotton li|brary, then placed in A&s;hburnham hou&s;e at We&s;tmin&s;ter, by which fatal accident this valuable volume was particularly damaged; and, as far as I can judge from a cur&s;ory in|&s;pection, mo&s;t of the leaves, if not all, con|taining Strype's extracts, were either de&s;troy|ed or obliterated<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">But &s;ee APPEND.

Strype,</HI> the reader will remember, that &s;uch citations were faithfully tran&s;cribed by my&s;elf from that manu&s;cript volume, now belonging to the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>Mr. Wi&s;e al&s;o tran&s;cribed, and communi|cated to me, two or three other papers from doctor Charlett's collections, be&s;ide tho&s;e of Strype which I have ju&s;t mentioned<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See pp. 185. 189. And APPEND. Numb. xxix.</NOTE>. The&s;e I have called <HI>MSS. F. Wi&s;e</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Since my fir&s;t edition, among the manu&s;cript papers of the Rev. Thomas Wilkes, D.D. fellow of Trinity college, Ox|ford, and who died rector of Rotherfield Greys in Oxford&s;hire, in 1745, I have met with other notices by Mr. Wi&s;e, which are now fir&s;t in&s;erted in this edition, and are al&s;o &s;tyled, MSS. F. Wi&s;e. The&s;e Mr. Wi&s;e &s;eems to have had chiefly from Dr. Charlett's collections, and the family-papers of the late &s;ir Harry Pope-Blount.</P>
<P>As to Charlett's collections, I learn that he derived many of his notices and informations on this &s;ubject, from Mr. Jo&s;iah Howe, a fellow of the college; a &s;hort account of whom will not be &s;uperfluous, as it may tend to e&s;tabli&s;h their credit. He was born at Crendon in Bucks, and elected Scholar of Trinity college, June 12, 1632. Regi&s;tr. Coll. fol. 68. b. Admitted Fellow, being then bachelor of Arts, May 26, 1637. Ibid. fol. 72. b. By Hearne he is called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a very great cavalier and loyali&s;s, and a mo&s;t ingenious man."</Q> Rob. Glouc. GLOSS. p. 669. He appears to have been a general and an accompli&s;h|ed &s;cholar, and in polite literature e&s;teemed one of the ornaments of the univer&s;ity. In 1644, he preached before king Charles the fir&s;t at Chri&s;t-church cathedral Oxford. The &s;ermon was printed, and in red letters, by the king's &s;pecial command. Only thirty copies were printed. One was purcha&s;ed, in 1723, by Hearne from Dr. Charlett's library: the &s;ame, and that per|haps the only one extant, which is now among Rawlin&s;on's Books in the Bodleian. See Hearne's MSS. COLL. vol. 102. p. 8. Charlett bought this rarity many years before, at the high price of five &s;hillings. Ibid. vol. 51. p. 176. In 1646, he was created Bachelor of Divinity by decree of the king, among others who were complimented with that degree for having di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as preachers before the Court at Oxford. He was &s;oon afterwards ejected from his Fellow&s;hip by the pre&s;byterians, but not in the general expul&s;ion in 1648, accord|ing to Walker, SUFF. CLERG. p. 134. Being one of the Bur|&s;ars of the college and fore&s;eeing its fate, having re&s;olved at the &s;ame time never to acknowledge the authority of Cromwell's vi&s;itors, he retired, in the beginning of the year 1648, to a college-e&s;tate in Buckingham&s;hire, carrying with him many ren|tals, rolls, papers, and other authentic documents, belonging to his office. He was invited to return to the college by Dr. Harris the new pre&s;byterian Pre&s;ident, on a promi&s;e, that if he would quietly give up the official books, his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the vi&s;itors &s;hould be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and he &s;hould be permitted to retain his fellow&s;hip without mole&s;tation. Harris by this artifice having recovered the books, immediately &s;igned an order for Howe's expul&s;ion; pretending to have received an unexpected injunction from the vi&s;itors, and profe&s;&s;ing his regret at being obliged to remove &s;o valuable a member from the foundation. Hearne, MSS. COLL. vol. 89. p. 195. He was re&s;tored to his fellow&s;hip in 1660. He has a Copy of recommendatory Engli&s;h ver&s;es prefixed to the folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher, printed in 1647. Another to Thomas Randoph's POEMS, reprinted at Oxford, in 1640. Another to Cartwright's COMEDIES and POEMS, at Oxford, 1651. The&s;e pieces in the witty epigrammatic &s;tyle which then prevailed, have uncommon acutene&s;s, and highly de&s;erve to be revived. Some others have perhaps e&s;caped me. In tho&s;e I have mentioned, he appears in company with Denham, Waller, Jon&s;on, Corbett, Brome, Shirley, Mayne, and others the mo&s;t ingenious men of tho&s;e times, who were of his intimate acquaintance. Wood &s;ays that he wrote a copy of Engli&s;he ver&s;es, which were much applauded, &s;poken before the duke and duche&s;s of York, in 1683, at Tri|nity college. MSS. Mu&s;. A&s;hmol. fol. 57. D. 19. He lived forty two years, greatly re&s;pected, after his re&s;titution, and ar|riving at the age of ninety, died fellow of the college, where he con&s;tantly re&s;ided, Aug. 28, 1701. He is interred, under a &s;mall marble lozenge, with a &s;hort in&s;cription, in the college-chapel. Hearne &s;ays, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he lived &s;o retiredly in the latter part of his life, that he rarely came abroad; &s;o that I could never &s;ee him, though I have often much de&s;ired to have a &s;ight of him."</Q> GLOSS. ut &s;upr. p. 670.

It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, and it has been &s;aid in general terms, that Sir Thomas Pope was appointed one of the commi&s;&s;ioners, or vi|&s;itors, under Cromwell, for di&s;&s;olving the reli|gious hou&s;es. It is indeed true, that he was one of tho&s;e, into who&s;e hands the &s;eal of the magnificent and opulent abbey of Saint Alban's was &s;urrendered on the fifth day of December, 1539, by the la&s;t abbot, Richard Stevenache<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stevens's Mona&s;ticon, i. 264.

Nor does his name occur in the private commi&s;&s;ions, which, after a dili|gent &s;earch, I have &s;een relating to this matter; nor in any in&s;truments of re&s;ignation, letters of advice to the vi&s;itor general, memorials, or other authentic papers, concerning the vi&s;itati|on or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any mona&s;tery. My opi|nion is therefore, that he was only occa&s;ionally employed at Saint Alban's, as being one of the principal officers in the court of augmentations, as the place was in the neighbourhood of Lon|don, and as the &s;urrender of &s;o famous an ab|bey was an affair of &s;ome importance. Thus we find that the priory, now the dean and chapter, of Canterbury, was not di&s;&s;olved in the ordi|nary way; it being thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the ma&s;ter of the rolls, Walter Henley attorney and Nicholas Bacon &s;ollicitor of the augmentation-court with four others, &s;hould be &s;ent thither, to take the re&s;ignation of the prior and monks<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Somner's CANTERBURY, by Batteley, Append. p. 118.

<P>It is no wonder, that the monks &s;hould load tho&s;e whom they e&s;teemed the in&s;truments of their ruin with many calumnies; all which were &s;tudiou&s;ly propagated and heightened by their advocates of the catholic per&s;ua&s;ion. And it &s;hould at the &s;ame time be remembered, that the king's injunctions, under which they acted, were extremely &s;evere; in&s;omuch, that many fraternities de&s;ired their hou&s;es might be rather entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, than reformed under &s;uch rigorous conditions.</P>

<P>IN the reign of Edward the &s;ixth, when the religious and political affairs of the kingdom took another turn, and all pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s fell into the hands of new mini&s;|ters and managers, &s;ir Thomas Pope did not comply with the times.

The unlimited authority, and arbitrary do|minion of Henry, had kept both prote&s;tants and papi&s;ts in &s;ubjection. Under &s;uch a govern|ment they both acted uniformly, and neither party pre&s;umed to claim any apparent &s;uperiori|ty. But upon the decea&s;e of that uncontroulable monarch, the people di&s;covered their real &s;en|timents without re&s;erve, and prote&s;tanti&s;m manife&s;tly began to be the prevailing religion. The protector Somer&s;et, who had long been a &s;ecret parti&s;an of the reformers, on the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of young Edward, publicly declared his intention of forwarding and e&s;tabli&s;hing the reformation. In this &s;cheme he was hap|pily &s;econded by mo&s;t of the privy council, who after the fall of Southampton &s;eem en|tirely to have de&s;erted the catholic commu|nion.

For the demo|lition of the&s;e hou&s;es was not an act of the church but of the &s;tate. It was prior to the reformation of religion, and effected by a king and parliament of the popi&s;h communion.

a bigotted catholic queen, and upon the re&s;to|ration of the popi&s;h religion. By way of pro|curing new conce&s;&s;ions in favour of Rome, and to prevent un&s;ea&s;onable alarms, at the begin|ning of this reign, both the queen and the pope had given repeated a&s;&s;urances that the church and abbey lands &s;hould remain, forever unreclaimed, in the hands of their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Heylin Eccle. re&s;t. p. 41.</NOTE>.

Thus, an equivalent was granted on both &s;ides.

<P>During this reign &s;ir Thomas Pope was often employed in commi&s;&s;ions of con&s;e|quence.

The duke him&s;elf had been apprehended &s;ome little time before. For after many fruitle&s;s efforts, and vain expectations of a reinforcement, he &s;uddenly changed his principles, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, and tamely &s;ubmitted to proclaim queen Mary with all external demon&s;trations of triumph and &s;atis|faction.

She &s;ometimes endeavoured to recruit her exhau&s;ted exchequer by retrench|ing the public expences at home. She de|moli&s;hed &s;everal forts on the river below Grave&s;end, which were filled with &s;uperflu|ous garri&s;ons; &s;he broke all the body guards, half the band of pen&s;ioners, the gentlemen of the &s;tables, and the pages of honor: and propo&s;ed to di&s;band the hundred archers of the guard. But to frugality &s;he added oppre&s;&s;ion, and her unhappy nece&s;&s;ities fre|quently compelled her to the mo&s;t violent and unju&s;tifiable experiments. She levied &s;ixty thou&s;and marks from &s;even thou&s;and yeomen, and thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds from the mer|chants. This was exacted, becau&s;e they had not contributed to a former loan of &s;ixty thou|&s;and pounds levied on a thou&s;and per&s;ons, in
<PB N="49" REF="64">
who&s;e compliance, either on account of their loyalty or their riches, &s;he firmly confided. But that tax not being found &s;ufficient, &s;he exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds each, on all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an annual income of twenty pounds. This impo&s;ition obliged many of the gentry to reduce their dome&s;tic expences, and to di&s;mi&s;s many of their &s;ervants, that they might, at lea&s;t more prudently, comply with her commands.

In order to gratify the city of London for pa&s;t favors, and to engage them to a&s;&s;i&s;t her with future &s;upplies, &s;he i&s;&s;ued an edict, at their in&s;tance, prohibit|ing for four months, the exportation of Eng|li&s;h clothes into Flanders.

But it would be endle&s;s and impertinent here, to mention at large her multiplied extortions; and the various imprudent or fraudulent &s;chemes, which her exigencies invented for obtaining money.

With regard to the per&s;ecutions of this reign, which occa&s;ioned the commi&s;&s;ion in which Sir Thomas Pope was concerned, re|lating to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of heretics, we will allow that the queen and her friends had &s;uffered, what they thought the mo&s;t in|jurious treatment; and, no doubt, when power returned into their hands, were but too na|turally di&s;po&s;ed to retaliate in their own way. The&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions, perhaps injudiciou&s;ly con|ducted, prepared the way for popery: ju&s;t as the &s;everities of Mary, at the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Eli&s;abeth made the prote&s;tants more violent again&s;t the papi&s;ts.

<P>But as no religion can expiate, &s;o no provo|cation can ju&s;tify, no re&s;entment can excu&s;e, that uninterrupted &s;eries of deliberate barbarity which marks every page of her unpro&s;perous annals with martyrdoms, hardly to be parallel|ed in the pagan per&s;ecutions of primitive chri&s;|tianity. If in the two preceding reigns, many venerable prelates of Mary's communion had been injuriou&s;ly treated, or even put to death, for con&s;cientious di&s;obedience, yet none of them were inhumanly dragged to the flames like the meek Latimer or the learned Rid|ley. It is al&s;o allowed, that to burn heretics was an e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine of the catholic re|ligion. But in what age of the &s;ame religion, or in what country, were the&s;e puni&s;hments ever executed with &s;o many circum&s;tances of cruelty? Her attempt to re&s;tore the mona&s;te|ries, however conformable to her &s;y&s;tem, was a mea&s;ure, which tended only to bring back national poverty with national &s;uper&s;tition: for
<PB N="61" REF="76">
it is certain, that Henry's di&s;tribution of the mona&s;tic revenues into private hands, although dictated by &s;elfi&s;h and fordid motives, founded the pre&s;ent greatne&s;s of England. In the mean time it will be but charitable to grant, that her private life was confe&s;&s;edly blamele&s;s and un|blemi&s;hed.

A&s;cham was preceptor to the prince&s;s.

My principal rea&s;on for mentioning the&s;e particulars is to &s;hew, that &s;ir Tho|mas Pope could not have been one of A&s;cham's enemies on this occa&s;ion; for, had that been the ca&s;e, it is not very probable that he &s;hould promote A&s;cham's friend.

is evident that he was removed from this charge, when the prince&s;s, notwith&s;tanding her infirm &s;tate of health, was hurried up to the court by Southwell, Cornwallis, and Ha&s;tings: nor do we find, that from that time he had the lea&s;t concern with her during her impri&s;onment in the tower and at Wood|&s;tock, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e unde&s;erved per|&s;ecutions, which preceded her enlargement and final removal to Hatfield.</P>
<P>To this lady &s;ir Thomas Pope behaved with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect: re|&s;iding with her at Hatfield, rather as an indulgent and affectionate guardian, than as an officious or rigorous governor.

<P>Nor was &s;ir Thomas Pope wanting on pro|per occa&s;ions, in &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;hewing her &s;uch marks of regard and deference as her &s;tation and quality demanded.

<P>Two of the fellows of Trinity college in Oxford, ju&s;t founded by him, had violated one of it's &s;tricte&s;t &s;tatutes, and were accordingly expelled by the pre&s;ident, and Society. Upon <PB N="84" REF="99">
this they repaired to their founder, then at Hatfield with the prince&s;s Eli&s;abeth, humb|ly petitioning a readmittance into his college.

But perceiving a happy opportu|nity of adju&s;ting the difficulty, by paying at the &s;ame time a hand&s;ome compliment to the prince&s;s, with much addre&s;s he referred the matter to her gracious arbitration; and &s;he was plea&s;ed to order, that they &s;hould imme|diately be re&s;tored to their fellow&s;hips.

<P>In the &s;ummer of the &s;ame year, the prin|ce&s;s paid a vi&s;it to the queen at Richmond. She went by water from Somer&s;et-place in the queen's barge; which was richly hung with garlands of artificial flowers, and cover|ed with a of canopy green &s;arcenet wrought with branches of eglantine in embroidery, and powdered with blo&s;&s;oms of gold. In the barge &s;he was accompanied by &s;ir Thomas Pope, and four ladies of her chamber. Six boats attended on this proce&s;&s;ion, filled with her highne&s;s's retinue, habited in ru&s;&s;et da|ma&s;ke and blue embroidered &s;attin ta&s;&s;elled and &s;pangled with &s;ilver, with bonnets of cloth of &s;ilver plumed with green feathers. She was received by the queen in a &s;ump|tuous pavilion, made in form of a ca&s;tle, with cloth of gold and purple velvet, in the labyrinth of the gardens. The walls, or
<PB N="90" REF="105">
&s;ides of the pavilion were chequered into compartments, in each of which was alter|nately a lily in &s;ilver and a pomegranate in gold. Here they were entertained at a royal banquet; in which was introduced a <HI>&s;ottletie</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">A curious devi&s;e in cookery or confectionary.</NOTE> of a pomegranate-tree bearing the arms of Spain. There were many min&s;trels, but no ma&s;king or dancing. Before the banquet, the queen was long in con&s;ultation with &s;ir Tho|mas Pope. In the evening the prince&s;s with all her company returned, as they came, to Somer&s;et-place; and the next day retired to Hatfield<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">MSS. Cotton. Vitell. F. 5. MSS.

Thus our chronicler, who is fond of minute de&s;cription. But the&s;e and other particularities, in&s;ignificant as they &s;eem, which he has recorded &s;o carefully, are a vindication of Queen Mary's character in the treatment of her &s;i&s;ter: they prove, that the prince&s;s, during her re&s;idence at Hatfield, lived in &s;plendor and affluence, that &s;he was often admitted to the diver&s;ions of the court, and that her pre&s;ent &s;ituation was by no means a &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion and impri&s;onment, as it has been re|pre&s;ented by mo&s;t of our hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>We have before &s;een that &s;ir Thomas Pope, during his attendance on this lady, was engaged in the foundation of his college. An undertaking of &s;uch a nature, could not fail of attracting the attention of the young Eli&s;abeth; who&s;e learned education and pre|&s;ent &s;ituation naturally intere&s;ted her in the progre&s;s of a work &s;o beneficial to the in|crea&s;e
<PB N="92" REF="107">
of her favorite pur&s;uits, and carried on by one with whom &s;he was &s;o nearly con|nected. Accordingly this &s;ubject was often matter of conver&s;ation between them, as ap|pears from part of a letter written by &s;ir Tho|mas Pope: which al&s;o &s;till further proves the friendly terms on which they lived together. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The prince&s;s Eli&s;abeth her grace, whom I &s;erve here, often a&s;kyth me about the cour&s;e I have devy&s;ed for my &s;collers: and that part of myne e&s;tatutes re&s;pectinge &s;tudie I have &s;hewn to her, which &s;he likes well.

A&s;cham, in one of his Latin Epi&s;tles, gives the following intere&s;ting account of Eli&s;abeth's progre&s;s in literature, when &s;he was very young, under the year 1550. Among the learned daughters of Sir Thomas More, he &s;ays, the prince&s;s Eli&s;abeth &s;aines like a &s;tar of di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre; deriving greater glory from her virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, and literary accompli&s;hments, than from the dignity of her exalted birth. I was her preceptor in Latin and Greek for two years. She was but little more than &s;ixteen, when &s;he could &s;peak French, and Italian, with as much fluency and propriety as her native Engli&s;h. She &s;peaks Latin readily, ju&s;tly, and even critically. She has often conver&s;ed with me in Greek, and with tolerable facility. When &s;he tran&s;cribes Greek or Latin, nothing can be more beautiful than her hand-writing. She is excellently &s;killed in mu&s;ic, although not very fond of it. She has read with me all Cicero, and great part of Livy. It is chiefly from tho&s;e two authors alone, that &s;he has acquired her knowledge of the Latin langnage. She begins the day with reading a portion of the Greek te&s;tament, and then &s;tudies &s;ome &s;elect Orations of I&s;ocrates and the tragedies of So|phocles. From the&s;e authors, I was of opinion, that &s;he would adorn her &s;tyle with the mo&s;t elegant diction, enrich her mind with the mo&s;t &s;uitable precepts, and frame her high &s;tation of life to every fortune. For her religious in&s;truction, after the Scriptures, &s;he adds to the cla&s;&s;ics Saint Cyprian and the Common Places of Melancthon, with other writers of that &s;chool, who teach purity of doctrine with elegance of expre&s;&s;ion. In every compo&s;ition, &s;he is very quick in pointing out a far-fetched word, or affected phra&s;e. She cannot endure tho&s;e ab&s;urd imitators of Era&s;mus, who mince the whole latin Language into proverbial maxims. She is much plea&s;ed with a Latin Oration naturally ari&s;ing from its &s;ubject, and written both cha&s;tly and per&s;picu|ou&s;ly. She is mo&s;t fond of tran&s;lations not too free, and with that agreeable cla&s;h of &s;entiment which re&s;ults from a judicious compari&s;on of oppo&s;ite or contradictory pa&s;&s;ages. By a dili|gent attention to the&s;e things, her ta&s;te is become &s;o refined, and her judgment &s;o penetrating, that there is nothing in Greek, Latin, and Engli&s;h compo&s;ition, either extravagant or exact, carle&s;s or correct, which &s;he does not in the cour&s;e of reading accurately di&s;cern; immediately rejecting the one with di&s;gu&s;t, and receiving the other with the highe&s;t degree of plea&s;ure.

<P>One &s;hould have expected that the queen would have parted in di&s;gu&s;t with the prin|ce&s;s, at this rejection of a match, recom|mended by Philip, and &s;o convenient to his purpo&s;es. But it appears, that the queen was extremely backward in promoting her hu&s;band's de&s;ire of marrying Eli&s;abeth to the duke of Savoy. On this account, Philip employed Alphon&s;us, a franci&s;can frier, his confe&s;&s;or, to confer with her maje&s;ty on the &s;ubject of this marriage. She told him, that &s;he feared, without con&s;ent of parlia|ment, neither her hu&s;band Philip, nor the nation would be benefited by this alliance. She added, that &s;he could not in point of con&s;cience pre&s;s this match upon her &s;i&s;ter;
<PB N="106" REF="121">
meaning perhaps that it would be unju&s;t, to force the prince&s;s to be married, after her re&s;olute declarations again&s;t wedlock; or im|proper and di&s;honorable, to match her be|neath the dignity of a crowned head. The theological rea&s;onings of Alphon&s;us were too refined for the under&s;tanding, or too weak for the con&s;cience, of the queen, who &s;till remained inflexible in her former opinion. Upon this, Philip wrote to her in his u&s;ual authoritative &s;tyle, advi&s;ing her to examine her own con&s;cience, and to con&s;ider whether her opinion was founded in truth or in ob|&s;tinacy; adding, that if the parliament op|po&s;ed his reque&s;t, he &s;hould lay the blame upon her<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl.

The queen, in her an&s;wer, beg|ged that he would, at lea&s;t, defer the mat|ter till he returned into England: and that then he might have a better opportunity of judging, what attention her rea&s;ons de|&s;erved.

<P>This letter which is in French, and print|ed by Strype<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Strype, Eccl. Mem. iii. Append. Numb.

Philip per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign: and with a view to accompli&s;h it more effectually, di&s;|patched into England the duche&s;s of Parma and the duche&s;s of Lorraine, whom he com|mi&s;&s;ioned to bring back with them the prin|ce&s;s Eli&s;abeth into Flanders. Philip was in love with the duche&s;s of Lorain; and the &s;plendor of her table and retinue, which &s;he was unable to &s;upport of her&s;elf, made the queen extremely jealous. She was therefore, whatever her companion might have been, a very improper &s;uitre&s;s on this occa&s;ion. The queen would not permit the two duche&s;&s;es to vi&s;it the prince&s;s at Hatfield; and every moment of their &s;tay gave her infinite unea&s;i|ne&s;s.

Perhaps the growing jealou&s;y of the queen, a pa&s;&s;ion which often ends in revenge again&s;t the beloved object, might at lea&s;t have &s;ome &s;hare in dictating this oppo&s;ition to Phi|lip<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Philip, while abroad, had &s;hewn her &s;o many marks of indifference, and had trifled with her &s;o frequently about his return to England, that once, in a fit of rage, &s;he tore his pic|ture.

<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of the new queen, who was re&s;ident at Hatfield when her &s;i&s;ter Mary died on November the &s;eventeenth, 1558, it does not appear that &s;ir Thomas Pope was continued in the privy-council.

<P>WE have now done with &s;ir Thomas Pope's political character; and are entering on that mo&s;t memorable circum|&s;tance of his life, before incidentally men|tioned, by which he &s;ecured immortality to his name, and conferred a perpetual emolu|ment on his country; I mean, the foundation of Trinity college in Oxford. His good &s;en&s;e and good di&s;po&s;ition led him to reflect, that he could not be&s;tow a competent pro|portion of tho&s;e riches which he had &s;o largely received, with greater propriety, uti|lity, and genero&s;ity, than in the &s;ervice of the public. I &s;hall therefore make no apology for delivering at large a hi&s;tory of his pro|ceedings in forming and completing this li|beral de&s;ign.</P>
<P>And perhaps there are &s;ome of my readers, who will be more plea&s;ed to view him in the milder and more amiable light of the father of ingenuous education, di&s;pen&s;ing rewards to &s;cience and virtue, than in the more active yet turbulent &s;cenes of public life, diver&s;ified only

<P>About the year 1290, Richard de Hoton, prior, and the monks, of the cathedral con|vent of Durham, erected a college in the northern &s;uburbs of Oxford, for the education of the novices of their mona&s;tery; to which it was con&s;idered as an appendage<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See grant in the Appendix, Numb.

It was at length entire|ly rebuilt, more effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed, and more amply endowed, for eight benedictine monks and eight &s;ecular &s;tudents, in the year 1370, by the munificence of Thomas Hatfield, bi&s;hop of the &s;ame &s;ee<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The monks were allowed annually ten pounds each, and the &s;eculars five mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

<PB N="136" REF="151">
could not have been conferred at a more &s;ea|&s;onable time on the univer&s;ity. And of this &s;ir Thomas Pope was very &s;en&s;ible, as we have before &s;een, when he &s;ub&s;tituted an ad|ditional number of academical &s;tudents in the place of a grammar-&s;chool.</P>
<P>But that it may further appear, how much the&s;e encouragements were now wanted, it will be nece&s;&s;ry to look backwards upon the &s;tate of learning in England, particularly at Oxford; and from thence to trace its progre&s;s, and the cau&s;es of its decline, down to the times with which we are concerned. An en|quiry not le&s;s in&s;tructive than entertaining, and naturally connected with the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>About the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century, a ta&s;te for polite letters, under the patronage of the popes, began to be revived in Italy. But the&s;e liberal pontiffs did not con&s;ider at the &s;ame time that they were undermining the pa|pal intere&s;t, and bringing on the Reforma|tion. This event is commonly called the Re&s;toration of Learning; but it &s;hould rather be &s;tyled the re&s;toration of good &s;en&s;e and u&s;eful knowledge. Learning there had been before, but barbari&s;m &s;till remained. The
<PB N="137" REF="152">
mo&s;t acute efforts of human wit and penetra|tion had been exerted for &s;ome centuries, in the di&s;&s;ertations of logicians and theologi&s;ts; yet Europe &s;till remained in a &s;tate of &s;uper|&s;tition and ignorance. What philo&s;ophy could not perform, was re&s;erved to be complet|ed by cla&s;&s;ical literature, by the poets and orators of Greece and Rome, who alone could enlarge the mind, and poli&s;h the man|ners. Ta&s;te and propriety, and a rectitude of thinking and judging, derived from the&s;e &s;ources, gave a new turn to the general &s;y&s;|tem of &s;tudy: mankind was civilized, and re|ligion was reformed. The effects of this happy revolution by degrees reached England.</P>
<P>We find at Oxford, in the latter end of the fifteenth century, that the univer&s;ity was filled with the jargon and di&s;putes of the Scoti&s;ts and Thomi&s;ts; and if at that time there were any &s;cholars of better note, the&s;e were chiefly the followers of Wicliffe, and were con&s;equently di&s;countenanced and per&s;ecuted. The latin &s;tyle then only known in the univer&s;ity, was the technical language of the &s;choolmen, of ca&s;ui&s;ts, and metaphy|&s;icians. At Cambridge, about 1485, nothing was taught but Alexander's <HI>Parva Lo|gicalia,</HI> the trite axioms of Ari&s;totle, which were never rationally explained, and the pro|found

At length &s;ome of our countrymen, the principal of which were Grocyn, Latymer, Lillye, Lina|cer, Tun&s;tall, Pace, and &s;ir Thomas More, ventured to break through the narrow bounds of &s;chola&s;tic erudition, and went over into Italy with a de&s;ign of acquiring a knowledge in the Greek and Latin languages.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Leland.

And at the &s;ame time it is to be remarked, that Fox does not appoint a philo&s;ophy-lecturer in his college, as had been the practice in mo&s;t of the pre|vious foundations; perhaps thinking, that &s;uch an in&s;titution would not have coincided

<P>The&s;e happy beginnings were &s;econded by the munificence of cardinal Wol&s;ed.

<P>But neither was Oxford, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, entirely free from the&s;e contracted notions. In 1519, a preacher at &s;aint Mary's church harangued with much violence again&s;t the&s;e pernicious teachers, and his arguments occa&s;ioned no &s;mall ferment among the &s;tu|dents.

But Henry the eighth, who was luckily a patron of the&s;e improvements, being then re&s;ident at the neighbouring royal manor of Wood&s;tock, and having received a ju&s;t &s;tate of the ca&s;e from Pace and More, immediately tran&s;mitted his royal mandate to the univer&s;ity, ordering that the&s;e &s;tudies &s;houd not only be permitted but encouraged<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Era&s;m. epi&s;t. ccclxxx. ut inf.</NOTE>.

<P>At length ancient ab&s;urdities univer&s;ally gave way to the&s;e encouragements: and at Oxford in particular, the&s;e united efforts for e&s;tabli&s;hing a new &s;y&s;tem of rational and manly learning were finally con&s;ummated in the magnificent foundation of Wol&s;ey's college, to which all the Learned of Europe were invited.</P>
<P>But the&s;e au&s;picious improvements in the &s;tate of learning did not continue long. A change of the national religion &s;oon hap|pened,
<PB N="147" REF="162">
and di&s;putes with the Lutherans en|&s;ued, which embroiling the minds of learn|ed men in difference of opinion, di&s;united their endeavours in the cau&s;e of literature, and diverted their attention to other enquiries.</P>
<P>Many of the abu&s;es in civil &s;ociety are attended with &s;ome advantages. In the be|ginnings of reformation, the lo&s;s of the&s;e ad|vantages is always felt very &s;en&s;ibly; while the benefit re&s;ulting from the change, is the &s;low effect of time, and not immediately percieved or enjoyed. Scarce any in&s;titution can be imagined le&s;s favorable to the in|tere&s;ts of mankind than the mona&s;tic. Yet a great temporary check given to the progre&s;s of literature at this period, was the di&s;|&s;olution of the mona&s;teries. For although the&s;e &s;eminaries were in general the nur&s;eries of illiterate indolence, and undoubtedly de|&s;erved to be de&s;troyed, yet the &s;till contained invitations and opportunities to &s;tudious lei|&s;ure and literary pur&s;uits. On this impor|tant event therefore, a vi&s;ible revolution and decline in the &s;tate of learning &s;ucceeded. Mo&s;t of the youth of the kingdom betook them&s;elves to mechanical or other illiberal employments, the profe&s;&s;ion of letters being now &s;uppo&s;ed to be without &s;upport and re|ward.
<PB N="148" REF="163">
By the abolition of the religious hou&s;es, many towns and their adjacent vil|lages were utterly deprived of their only means of in&s;truction. What was taught in the mona&s;teries was perhaps of no great im|portance, but &s;till it &s;erved to keep up a cer|tain degree of nece&s;&s;ary knowledge. Hence provincial ignorance became almo&s;t univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we forget, that &s;everal of the abbots were per&s;ons of public &s;pirit: by their connection with parliament, they became ac|quainted with the world; and knowing where and how to chu&s;e proper objects, and having no other u&s;e for the &s;uperfluity of their va&s;t revenues, encouraged, in their re&s;pective circles, many learned young men.</P>
<P>It is generally thought, that the reformation of religion, the mo&s;t happy and important event of modern times, was immediately &s;uc|ceeded by a flouri&s;hing &s;tate of learning. But this, in England at lea&s;t, was by no means the ca&s;e; and for a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was produced. Yet, in 1535, the king's vi&s;itors ordered lectures in humanity to be founded in tho&s;e &s;ocieties at Oxford where they were yet wanting: and

the&s;e injunctions were &s;o warmly &s;econded and approved by the &s;cholars in the large&s;t colleges, that they &s;eized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus, and other irrefrag|able logicians, and tearing them in pieces, di&s;per&s;ed them in great triumph about their quadrangles, or gave them away as u&s;ele&s;s lumber<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Layton's Letter to Cromwell.

I need not recall to the reader's memory, that &s;ir Tho|mas Pope, and &s;ir Thomas Whyte, were &s;till more important benefactors by their re&s;pec|tive foundations. Without all the&s;e favors, although they did not perhaps produce an immediate improvement, the univer&s;ity would &s;till have continued to decay: and they were at lea&s;t a balance, at that time, on the &s;ide of learning, again&s;t the pernicious effects of returning popery.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reign of Eli&s;abeth, which &s;oon followed, when prote&s;tanti&s;m might have been expected to produce a &s;peedy change for the better, puritani&s;m began to prevail, and for &s;ome time continued to retard the progre&s;s of ingenuous and u&s;eful know|ledge. The Engli&s;h reformed clergy, who during the per&s;ecutions of queen Mary had fled into Germany, now returned in great numbers'; and in con&s;ideration of their &s;uffer|ings and learning, many of them were prefer|red to eminent &s;tations in the church. They brought back with them tho&s;e narrow prin|ciples about church-government and ceremo|nies, which they had imbibed, and which did well enough, in the petty &s;tates and republics
<PB N="154" REF="169">
abroad, where they lived like a &s;ociety of philo&s;ophers; but which were incon&s;i&s;tent with the genius of a more extended church, e&s;tabli&s;hed in a great and magnificent nation, and requiring a &s;ettled &s;y&s;tem of policy, and the ob&s;ervance of external in&s;titutions. How|ever, they were judged proper in&s;truments to be employed at the head of eccle&s;ia&s;tical af|fairs, by way of making the reformation at once effectual. But unluckily this mea&s;ure, &s;pecious as it appeared at fir&s;t, tended to draw the church into the contrary extreme. In the mean time their reluctance or ab&s;olute refu&s;al to conform, in many in&s;tances, to the e&s;tabli&s;hed ceremonies, and their &s;peculative theology, tore the church into violent divi|&s;ions, and occa&s;ioned endle&s;s ab&s;urd di&s;putes, unfavorable to the progre&s;s of real learning, and productive of an illiterate clergy, at lea&s;t un&s;killed in liberal and manly &s;cience.</P>
<P>In fact, even the common eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments had been &s;o much dimini&s;hed by the &s;eizure and alienation of impropria|tions, in the late depredations of the church, which were not yet ended, that few per&s;ons were regularly bred to the church, or, in other words, received a learned education. Hence almo&s;t any that offered them&s;elves,

were without di&s;tinction admitted to the &s;a|cred function. In&s;omuch, that in 1560, an injunction was directed to the bi&s;hop of Lon|don from his metropolitan, ordering him to forbear ordaining any more artificers, and other unlearned per&s;ons who had exerci&s;ed &s;e|cular occupations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Grindal. b. i. ch. 4. pag. 40.</NOTE>. But as the evil was un|avoidable, this caution took but little effect. About the year 1563, there were only two divines, the dean of Chri&s;t Church, and the pre&s;ident of Magdalene college, who were capable of preaching the public &s;ermons at Oxford<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Wood, ut &s;upr. i. 285.</NOTE>. Many proofs have been mentioned of the extreme ignorance of our clergy at this time: to which I &s;hall add one, which is curious and new. In 1570, Horne bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter enjoined the Minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory, every week, one chapter of &s;aint Paul's epi&s;tles in latin: and this ta&s;k, beneath the abilities of an ordinary &s;chool-boy, was actually repeated by &s;ome of them, before the bi&s;hop, dean, and prebendaries, at a public epi&s;copal vi&s;itation of that church<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Regi&s;tr.

<P>The ta&s;te for latin compo&s;ition, and it was fa&s;hionable both to write and &s;peak in that

language, was much wor&s;e than in the reign of Henry the eighth, when ju&s;ter models were &s;tudied. One is &s;urprized to find the learned archbi&s;hop Grindal, in the &s;tatutes of a &s;chool which he founded and amply endowed, pre|&s;cribing &s;uch &s;trange cla&s;&s;ics as Palingenius, Sedulius, and Prudentius, to be taught in the new &s;eminary<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Strype's Life of Grindal. B. ii. ch. 17. pag. 312. This was A.D. 1583.</NOTE>. Much has been &s;aid about the pa&s;&s;ion for reading Greek which prevailed in this reign. But this affectation was confined to the queen, and a few others: and here it went no farther than o&s;tentation and pedantry. It was by no means the na|tional &s;tudy; nor do we find that it improved the ta&s;te, or influenced the writings, of that age. But I am wandering beyond the bounds which I fir&s;t pre&s;cribed to this nece&s;&s;ary di|gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t add an ob&s;ervation or two. In government, many &s;hocks mu&s;t happen before the con&s;titution is perfected. In like manner, it was late in the reign of Eli&s;abeth, before learning, after its &s;inews had been re|laxed by frequent changes and commotions, recovered its proper tone, and ro&s;e with new vigor, under the genial influence of the

prote&s;tant religion.

In the large old man&s;ion hou&s;e at Filkins, a hamlet of Broadwell, pulled down about fifty years ago, there were on the &s;pouts the initials E.

But to &s;ay the truth, this little work is the voyage of a &s;ceptic: it has more of the philo&s;opher than the tra|veller, and would probably never have been written, but for the purpo&s;e of in&s;inuating his religious &s;entiments. Yet his reflections are &s;o &s;triking and original, and &s;o artfully inter|woven with the thread of his adventures, that they enliven, in&s;tead of embarra&s;&s;ing, the nar|rative. He has the plau&s;ible art of colouring his paradoxes with the re&s;emblance of truth. So little penetration had the orthodox court of Charles the fir&s;t, that merely on the merit of this book, he was appointed one of the band of Pen&s;ioners<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">For &s;ome of his other pieces, &s;ee Wood's ATH.

His CENSURA CELEBRIORUM AUTHORUM, which is a compilation of great erudition and labour, is well known to the critic and the li|terary hi&s;torian.

<PB N="208" REF="225">
to cite his authorities. His ESSAYS on vari|ous &s;ubjects are learned and judicious, and they have the ea&s;e and freedom, without the &s;ingularity, of Montaigne. Another of his works, which has been &s;uper&s;eded by tho&s;e who have u&s;ed its materials, is REMARKS ON POETRY. Of this piece it will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that it was honoured with the appro|bation of lord Mulgrave, the mo&s;t elegant critic of the author's age. Charles Blount, or Pope-Blount, e&s;quire, &s;econd &s;on of &s;ir Henry abovementioned, inherited his father's philo&s;ophy.

His ANI|MA MUNDI, ORACLES OF REASON, LIFE OF APPOLLONIUS TYANAEUS, and DIA|NA OF THE EPHESIANS, written with great learning, &s;agacity, wit, and force of rea&s;on|ing, are the con&s;olation of infidels, and are melancholy monuments of admirable abilities abu&s;ed in the defence of a futile but danger|ous cau&s;e<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See the MISCELLANEOUS WORKS of Charles Blount, pub|li&s;hed by Charles Gildon in 1693.

Mr. Blount, on the death of his wife, fell in love with her &s;i&s;ter, a lady of great beauty and accompli&s;hments: &s;he was not in&s;en&s;i|ble to his attachment, but was &s;crupulous about the legality of marrying her &s;i&s;ter's late hu&s;band.

The&s;e were &s;ir Thomas More, lord Audley, &s;ir Richard Southwell, &s;ir Thomas Stradling, &s;ir Nicho|las Bacon, &s;ir Thomas Cornewallys, &s;ir Fran|cis Englefield, &s;ir Robert Southwell, &s;ir Ed|ward Waldegrave, William Cordall, e&s;quire, Richard Gooderick, John Wy&s;eman, &s;ir Ar|thur Darcy, &s;ir Gilbert Gerrard, lord Vaulx, &s;ir Thomas Brydges, cardinal Pole, Thirlby bi&s;hop of Ely, &s;ir Thomas Whyte, lord Wil|liams of Thame, Whyte bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter, and Thomas Slythur&s;te, pre&s;ident of Tri|nity college &s;o often mentioned.</P>
<P>I need not repeat his la&s;t interview with &s;ir THOMAS MORE: of whom it will be &s;ufficient to add here, that he was the great|e&s;t ornament of the Engli&s;h nation at the re&s;|toration of polite literature; that he was a

It does not very plainly appear who were his maje&s;ty's principal coun&s;ellors in this affair: but we are a&s;&s;ured, by concurrent and undoubted authorities, that the rigorous execution of tho&s;e laws which the king had at fir&s;t in|tended, was prevented by the &s;pirited inter|po&s;ition of lord Audley<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See BIOGRAPH.

<PB N="238" REF="255">
originated from Gardiner, who was the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter when the foundation was pro|jected; and who, moreover, had been gover|nor of a college at Cambridge; was now chancellor of that univer&s;ity, a learned civi|lian, a &s;cholar of the fir&s;t rank, an eminent patron of literature<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Gardiner's literary character has been commonly overlooked in his political, and is rarely regarded or acknowledged. He was admirably &s;killed in the Greek language, at a time when it was cultivated in England only by a few neglected &s;cholars. His ideas of pure Latinity were refined to a fault; and he car|ried his notions of the cha&s;te Roman phra&s;eology to &s;uch a nicety, as to be e&s;teemed a Ciceronian by his cotemporaries. Leland, the mo&s;t polite cla&s;&s;ical writer in England at that pe|riod, congratulates &s;ome of his elegant friends, on their being educated in the college over which Gardiner pre&s;ided at Cam|bridge; and which, under &s;uch a governor, had become the &s;eat of eloquence and of the choir of the Mu&s;es. Leland al&s;o characteri&s;es Gardiner by the epithet DISERTUS, or the ma&s;ter of genuine Latinity; and calls him the re&s;torer of cla&s;&s;ical compo&s;ition, and the &s;tudy of philology, at Cambridge. EX|COM. p. 100. edit. 1589. Leland paid the&s;e compliments before Gardiner was a bi&s;hop, and when there were no tempta|tions to flattery. Many of A&s;cham's ter&s;e Latin epi&s;tles are ad|dre&s;&s;ed to this prelate: in which, his di&s;tingui&s;hed learning, his &s;ollicitude for the revival of ancient letters, and his general pa|tronage, are repeatedly di&s;played in the highe&s;t yet unaffected terms of panegyric. In one of the&s;e, A&s;cham expre&s;&s;es his great &s;atisfaction, that Gardiner, who excells all others in cri|tical di&s;cernment, had &s;o warmly approved his TOXOPHILUS, then ju&s;t publi&s;hed, and written with a view to teach a ju&s;t Engli&s;h &s;tyle; and de&s;ires that the bi&s;hop, <HI>pro eo amore quo lite|ras et earum cultores unice amplecteris,</HI> would recommend that book to the king. Lib. ii. p. 85. b. edit. 1581. In another, he thanks the bi&s;hop for honouring him with &s;o many marks of notice and attention, when he came, an unknown and ob&s;cure academic, to court. He recommends a tutor to the duke of Norfolk's nephew; and wi&s;hes that Gardiner, who is &s;o emi|nent a judge and protector of literary merit, would ratify the choice. Ibid. p. 92. a. In a third, lamenting the untimely death of king Edward the &s;ixth, he petitions Gardiner among other reque&s;ts, to intercede with queen Mary, for the continu|ance of his pen&s;ion originally granted by king Henry the eighth, as a reward for his TOXOPHILUS: profe&s;&s;ing his confi|dence in the bi&s;hop's known erudition, authority, liberality, prudence, and activity, to quiet the di&s;tractions which not only the civil but literary &s;tate of the kingdom would probably &s;uffer, from that unexpected and calamitous event. Ibid. p. 154. b. Dat. 1553. In the next, he pre&s;ents the bi&s;hop, then ju&s;t re|lea&s;ed from impri&s;onment in the TOWER at the acce&s;&s;ion of Mary, with a Greek TRANSLATION of the PSALMS, probably the METAPHRASE of APOLLINARIUS: enforcing the propriety of his pre&s;ent by ob&s;erving, that it was written in a language in which the bi&s;hop &s;o much delighted, and that poetry had been his chief amu&s;ement during the tedious hours of his late confinement.

his intere&s;t with the queen, to a canonry of Wind&s;or. He &s;eems to have conceived a high opinion of Slythur&s;te's learning and pru|dence; whom, from the tru&s;t committed to his charge, we rea&s;onably may imagine to have been a per&s;on of di&s;tingui&s;hed worth and abilities. In a general Addre&s;s to the new &s;ociety, annexed to the &s;tatutes of the college, he particularly compliments the pre|&s;ident for his remarkable moderation of tem|per, his eminent learning, experience, pru|dence, and probity; ob&s;erving moreover, in ju&s;tification of his choice, that he &s;hould have acted in vain, if he had not added to the benefit of his foundation &s;uch a governor, &s;o properly qualified in every requi&s;ite accom|pli&s;hment; one completely fitted for the dif|ficult and critical ta&s;k of conducting the fir&s;t beginnings of a recent in&s;titution, and to whom therefore, borrowing the character of a father in that of a founder, he with plea|&s;ure entru&s;ted the education of his children. On various occa&s;ions, &s;ir Thomas Pope ap|pears to have placed the greate&s;t confidence in his friend&s;hip, advice, and judgement.

was ejected from his head&s;hip by the Queen's vi&s;itors, and committed a pri&s;oner to the Tower of London; where he died of grief, 1560, partly for the death of his honored friend and munificent patron the founder, and partly for the lo&s;s of his preferments.</P>

<P>Cuffe, being a boy of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing abilities and uncommon proficiency in litera|ture, was &s;ent at fifteen years of age, by Lady Elizabeth Powlett, often mentioned above, from Hinton &s;aint George in Somer&s;et&s;hire, to Trinity college in Oxford, where he was elected &s;cholar on the twentyfifth of May,

Indeed, it was no part of the accu&s;ation again&s;t Cuffe, that, as Wood's context in&s;inuates, his plea&s;antry led him to depreciate the buildings of his founder: but that he wantonly converted one of his practi|cal jokes, a &s;pecies of humour not uncommon among our fe&s;tive ance&s;tors, into a petty larceny.

<P>FROM a recapitulation of what has been &s;aid, the following character of &s;ir THO|MAS POPE ari&s;es. He appears to have been a man eminently qualified for bu&s;ine&s;s; and al|though not employed in the very principal departments of &s;tate, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed peculiar talents and addre&s;s for the management and execution of public affairs. His natural abi|lities were &s;trong, his knowledge of the world deep and exten&s;ive, his judgment &s;olid and di&s;cerning. His circum&s;pection and prudence in the conduct of negociations entru&s;ted to his charge, were equalled by his fidelity and per&s;everance. He is a con&s;picuous in&s;tance of one, not bred to the church, who without the advantages of birth and patrimony, by the force of under&s;tanding and indu&s;try, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to opulence and honorable employments. He lived in an age when the peculiar circum&s;tances of the times afforded obvious temptations to the mo&s;t abject de|&s;ertion of principle: and few periods of our hi&s;tory can be found, which exhibit more numerous examples of occa&s;ional compliance
<PB N="257" REF="274">
with frequent changes. Yet he remained unbia&s;&s;ed and uncorrupted amid the general depravity. Under Henry the eighth, when on the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;teries, he was enabled by the opportunities of his &s;itua|tion to enrich him&s;elf with their revenues by fraudulent or oppre&s;&s;ive practices, he behaved with di&s;intere&s;ted integrity; nor does a &s;ingle in&s;tance occur upon record which impeaches his honor. In the &s;ucceeding reign of Ed|ward the &s;ixth, a &s;udden check was given to his career of popularity and pro&s;perity: he retained his original attachment to the catholic religion; and on that account, lo&s;t tho&s;e marks of favor or di&s;tinction which were &s;o liberally di&s;pen&s;ed to the &s;ycophants of Somer&s;et, and which he might have ea&s;ily &s;ecured by a temporary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the reigning &s;y&s;tem. At the acce&s;&s;ion of Mary, he was re&s;tored to favor; yet he was never in&s;trumental or active in the tyrannies of that queen which di&s;grace our annals. He was armed with di&s;cretionary powers for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of heretical innovations; yet he forbore to gratify the arbitrary demands of his bigotted mi&s;tre&s;s to their utmo&s;t extent, nor would he participate in forwarding the barbarities of her bloody per&s;ecutions. In the guardian&s;hip of the prince&s;s Elizabeth,
<PB N="258" REF="275">
the unhappy victim of united &s;uper&s;tition, jealou&s;y, revenge and cruelty, his humanity prevailed over his intere&s;t; and he le&s;s re|garded the di&s;plea&s;ure of the vigilant and unforgiving queen, than the claims of injur|ed innocence. If it be his crime to have ac|cumulated riches, let it be remembered, that he con&s;ecrated a part of tho&s;e riches, not amid the terrors of a death-bed, nor in the dreams of old age, but in the prime of life, and the vigour of under&s;tanding, to the pub|lic &s;ervice of his country; that he gave them to future generations, for the perpetual &s;up|port of literature and religion.</P>

When Trinity college and &s;aint John's were founded, the two founders jointly erected the &s;tone wall which now &s;eparates the groves, or gardens, of the two col|leges. That this was done by agreement between them both, I collect from the words of a letter from &s;ir Thomas Pope, to the pre&s;ident, dat. Jul. xxiv. 1557, in which, he de&s;ires the pre&s;i|dent to be&s;peak for him, a certain large quantity of &s;tone, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"for &s;o much I think I &s;hall occupie <HI>for my part</HI> of Mr. [&s;ir Tho|mas] White's wall."</Q> Afterwards, &s;ir T.

<P>On the whole it appears, that <HI>Simon,</HI> fellow of Magdalene college, mentioned in this in&s;trument, who married <HI>Eli&s;abeth Love,</HI> was the per&s;on who&s;e name occurs in papers and accounts (See LIFE, 183.) at the foundation of Trinity college, and who was the founder's agent.</P>
<P>The manor of Northleigh afore&s;aid, being parcel of Nettley abbey in Hamp&s;hire, was granted to &s;ir Thomas Pope and his heirs in the year 1545, by patent of Henry the eighth, anno regn. 36. Jul. 28. par. 8. From him it de&s;cended to his widow dame Eli&s;abeth. Late in the reign of queen Eli&s;abeth, it ap|pears to have been ve&s;ted in the de&s;cendants of Robert Parrot, or rather Perrot, abovementioned; who&s;e &s;on Simon, as we have &s;een, married Eli&s;abeth Love, &s;ir Thomas Pope's niece. Wood [Ath. Oxon. i. Fa&s;t. 23. ut &s;upr.] is mi&s;taken in &s;aying, that the &s;aid Robert, the founder of this family in Oxford&s;hire, was the &s;econd &s;on of George Perrot of Harold&s;ton near Haver|ford we&s;t in Pembrok&s;hire. It is proved from better authority, that he was born at Hacknes in the North riding of York&s;hire. MS. REGISTR. PARROT, ut &s;upr. fol. 111. b. The family of Perrot lived at Northleigh, in their antient capital man&s;ion hou&s;e, till within the&s;e few years: but are now extinct, at lea&s;t in the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.

<P>&dtristar; When this per&s;on was removed from his fel|low&s;hip, the founder intended, partly on the recom|mendation of cardinal Pole, to place in his room the learned William Alan, a name equally celebrated among the catholics, and pro&s;cribed by the prote&s;|tants. But that de&s;ign did not take effect: he being promoted about the &s;ame time, and probably by the intere&s;t of &s;ir Thomas Pope, to a canonry in the cathedral of York<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">MSS. F. Wi&s;e, ut &s;upr.</NOTE>. Alan was an able controver|&s;iali&s;t in defence of the declining doctrines of the church of Rome: educated at Oriel college, and about the year 1556, appointed Principal of &s;aint Mary's HALL, and elected one of the proctors of the univer&s;ity of Oxford. Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of queen Eli&s;abeth, he retired to Louvain, where he wrote his famous book on PURGATORY and PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD, which abounds in rhetoric more than argument, and contains much ingenious decla|mation and &s;ophi&s;try. Soon afterwards he returned to England, where he publi&s;hed many &s;pecious apo|logies for his religion, which he di&s;per&s;ed with great art and indu&s;try. But the treati&s;e ju&s;t men|tioned

Bodl. 198. The hi&s;tory of this venerable volume is curious, and de&s;erves to be developed at large. It is beautifully written on vellum in folio; and ori|ginally belonged to Robert Gro&s;thead bi&s;hop of Lincoln in the thirteenth century, in who&s;e hand are many notes in the mar|gins. Gro&s;thead gave it to the convent of Friars Minors at Oxford. The&s;e Friars gave it to the famous theologi&s;t Thomas Ga&s;coigne, under their &s;eal, about the year 1433. Ga&s;coigne pre&s;ented it to Durham college at Oxford, and at length Allen placed it in the Bodleian library. At the end of this manu&s;cript there is a long note written by Ga&s;coigne, which Tanner has printed, Bibl. p. 311. All the books belonging to the library of Richard de Bury in Durham college, were di&s;|per&s;ed &s;oon after the di&s;&s;olution of that hou&s;e. Some were re|moved to the Humfredian library, and others to Baliol college; but the greater part became the property of Doctor Owen, to whom Durham college was granted. Archbi&s;hop Parker pro|cured many Saxon manu&s;cripts of Doctor Owen. In the Cotton library, there is a volume con&s;i&s;ting of a collection of charters, and other antient writings, tran&s;cribed by Jocelyn, Parker's chaplain: who has in&s;erted this note at many of the pieces. <HI>The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury had this charter from Dr. Owen.</HI> At &s;ome others, <HI>The copy of this Dr. Tallot had of Dr. Owen.</HI> VI|TELL. D. 7. Robert Talbot, the annotator on Antoninus, was employed by the archbi&s;hop to collect antient manu&s;cripts, chiefly Saxon. Many of Parker's books, now in Bennet college library at Cambridge, appear to have belonged to Talbot. The archbi&s;hop's principal collector was Bateman, another of his chaplains; who &s;ays, that he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"gathered within four years, under his graces commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred books."</Q> Bateman's DOOM <HI>warning all men to judgment, &amp;c.</HI> Lond. 1581. 4to. pag. 400.

This prelate was one of the earlie&s;t Engli&s;h re&s;torers of literature. Of his PHILOBIB|LON, I have &s;poken at large in the SECOND DISSERTATION prefixed to the fir&s;t volume of the HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY. He held &s;ome of the highe&s;t offices both in church and &s;tate under Edward the third, who&s;e education he had &s;u|perintended. In the year 1331, he was &s;ent by that king to Avignon, to negotiate &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s with the pope. Rymer, FOED. ii. 59. He there lodged in the hou&s;e of cardinal Colonne, where Petrarch at that time al&s;o re&s;ided. Petrarch embraced the fortunate opportunity of con&s;ulting this learned Engli&s;hman, then only a private eccle&s;ia&s;tic, about the &s;ituation of the antient Thule, &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of the Briti&s;h i&s;lands: for the geo|graphy of antiquity was one of Petrarch's favorite &s;tudies. Be|ing without his books, of which he had ama&s;&s;ed a prodigious collection, he promi&s;ed to tran&s;mitt to Petrarch the be&s;t infor|mation he could obtain on this &s;ubject, after his return to Eng|land. What had immediately given ri&s;e to Petrarch's curio&s;ity about this i&s;land, probably was Giraldus's fabulous account of Thule, in his MIRABILIA HIBERNIAE, a work ju&s;t publi&s;h|ed, and recently tran&s;lated into French by John of Meun, author of the <HI>Romaunt de la Ro&s;e.</HI> Petrarch wrote frequently to Richard of Bury to know the re&s;ult of his promi&s;ed enquiries about Thule: but, perhaps in con&s;equence of Bury's important occu|pations, never received any an&s;wer. See Petrarchae EPISTOL. iii. 1. In this epi&s;tle, Petrarch calls Bury, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Virum ardentis ingenii nec literarum in&s;cium, abditarumque rerum &s;upra fidem curio&s;um."</Q> The ingenious author of LA VIE DE PE|TRARQUE, thinks that Petrarch's letters to Bury are now in &s;ome library of England.

<P>For from what is here collected on this &s;ubject, it mu&s;t appear, that our great poet, ALEXANDER POPE, was related to this family only by &s;ome colla|teral branch. I have mentioned all the male i&s;&s;ue, and their marriages; except the marriages of John

If it can be proved that he was the father of the elder Alexander Pope, it will follow that Thomas Pope, &s;econd earl of Downe, was his uncle: and con&s;equently, that &s;ir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity college, was the poet's uncle, to a high de|gree. It may perhaps be trifling to mention, that ALEXANDER POPE occurs twice as a name in this family, in, and about, Temp. Edw. iii.&mdash;MSS.

Be&s;ides, had the poet been de|&s;cended from either of the&s;e two younger &s;ons, the title of earl of Downe could not have failed during his own and his father's life-time. Mr. Pope tells us, that, his <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Father [Alexander] was of a gentle|man's family in Oxford&s;hire, the head of which was the earl of Downe, who&s;e &s;ole heire&s;s married the earl of Lind&s;ey.

Wood, Bibl. Bodl. Oxon. Viz. A loo&s;e paper in&s;erted in A. Wood's MS. ENGLISH Hi&s;tory of the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, tom. ii. fol. 388. Dr. Ralph Kettel was pre&s;ident of Trinity college, and an ex|cellent governor, for near fifty years. He had been fellow and &s;cholar of the college for fourteen years, during the life-time of this lady. His family lived in her neighbourhood, at King's Langley in Hertford&s;hire. She probably &s;ent him to the col|lege, where he was admitted &s;cholar, Jun. 16, 1579. Regi&s;tr. prim. fol. 30. He was chaplain to Bil&s;on bi&s;hop of Winche&s;|ter, and to lady Wal&s;ingham, widow of the Secretary. A good old portrait of him, in a brown furred gown, is in the college.

SURREY, tom. v. p. 406. His Life, but with many mi&s;takes and ab&s;urdities, is among Aubrey's manu&s;cript LIVES in the A&s;hmolean Mu|&s;eum.</P>
<P>The following anecdote is recorded of Dr. Kettel, which I relate, becau&s;e it is imperfectly told by Aubrey, and as it marks the times. While pre&s;ident, it was his cu&s;tom to attend daily the DISPUTATIONS in the college-hall, on which occa&s;ion he con&s;tantly wore a large black-furred muff. Before him &s;tood an hour-gla&s;s, brought by him&s;elf into the hall, and placed on a table, for a&s;certaining the time of the continuance of the exer|ci&s;e, which was to la&s;t an hour at lea&s;t. One morning, after Cromwell's &s;oldiers had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Oxford, a halberdier ru&s;hed into the hall during this ceremony, and plucking off our venerable doctor's muff, threw it in his face; and then with a &s;troke of his halberd broke the hour-gla&s;s in pieces. The doc|tor, though old and infirm, in&s;tantly &s;eized the &s;oldier by the collar, who was &s;oon overpowered by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the di&s;|putants. The halberd was carried out of the hall in triumph before the doctor; but the pri&s;oner, with his halberd, was quickly re&s;cued by a party of &s;oldiers, who &s;tood at the bottom of the hall, and had enjoyed the whole tran&s;action. <HI>MS.
