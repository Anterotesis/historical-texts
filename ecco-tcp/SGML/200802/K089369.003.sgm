<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Two former Volumes of <HI>PAMELA</HI>; or, <HI>VIRTUE REWARDED,</HI> met with a Succe&s;s greatly exceeding the mo&s;t &s;anguine Expectations: And the Editor hopes, that the Letters which compo&s;e the&s;e, will be found equally written to <HI>NATURE,</HI> avoiding all romantick Flights, improba|ble Surprizes, and irrational Machinery; and that the Pa&s;&s;ions are touched, where requi&s;ite, and Rules, equally <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Practicable,</HI> inculcated throughout the Whole, for the <HI>General Conduct of Life</HI>: And, therefore he flatters him&s;elf, that they may expect the good Fortune, which few <HI>Continuations</HI> have met with, to be judg'd not unworthy the Fir&s;t nor di&s;|proportion'd
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
to the more exalted Condition in which <HI>PAMELA</HI> was de&s;tin'd to &s;hine, as an affectionate <HI>Wife,</HI> a faithful <HI>Friend,</HI> a polite and kind <HI>Neighbour,</HI> an indul|gent <HI>Mother,</HI> and a beneficent <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s;</HI> after having in the Two former Volumes &s;upported the Character of a dutiful <HI>Child,</HI> a &s;potle&s;s <HI>Virgin,</HI> and a mode&s;t and amia|ble <HI>Bride.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader will ea&s;ily &s;ee, that, in &s;o great a Choice of Materials, as mu&s;t ari&s;e from a Multitude of important Subjects, in a married Life; to &s;uch Genius's and Friend&s;hips as tho&s;e of Mr. and Mrs, <HI>B.</HI> the Editor's greate&s;t Difficulty was, how to bring them within the Compa&s;s which he was determined not to exceed. And it having been left to his own Choice, in what manner to dige&s;t and publi&s;h the Letters, and where to clo&s;e the Work, he had intended, at fir&s;t, in regard to his other Avocations, end &s;ome De&s;igns of
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
another Nature in which he was engaged, to have carry'd the Piece no farther than the Two former Volumes; as may be ga|the'd from the Conclu&s;ion of the Fir&s;t-Five Editions.</P>
<P>It may be expected, therefore, that he &s;hould enter into an Explanation of the Rea&s;ons whereby he was provoked into a Nece&s;&s;ity of altering his Intention. But he is willing to decline &s;aying Any-thing upon &s;o well-known a Subject; le&s;t his Intere&s;t might appear more concern'd, than the Satisfaction of the Publick.</P>
<P>The Editor has been much pre&s;s'd with Importunities and Conjectures in relation to the Per&s;on and Family of the incompa|rable Lady, who is the Subject of the&s;e Volumes: All that he thinks him&s;elf at Liberty to &s;ay, or is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;aid, is only to repeat what has been already hinted, That the Story has its Foundation in
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
Truth: That the mo&s;t material Incidents (as will be collected from &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in the Letters) happen'd between the Years <HI>1717</HI> and <HI>1730:</HI> And that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity, for obvious Rea&s;ons, to vary and di&s;gui&s;e &s;ome Facts and Circum|&s;tances, as al&s;o the Names of Per&s;ons, Places, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_WE arrived here la&s;t Night, highly plea&s;ed with our Journey, and the Occa&s;ion of it, May God ble&s;s you both with long Life and Health, to enjoy your &s;weet Farm, and pretty Dwelling, which is ju&s;t what I wi&s;hed it to be. And don't make your grateful Hearts too un|ea&s;y in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, by your mode&s;t Diffidence of your own Worthine&s;s: For, at the &s;ame time that it is what will do Honour to the be&s;t of Gentlemen,
<PB N="2" REF="7">
it is not &s;o <HI>very</HI> extraordinary, con&s;idering his Con|dition, as that it will give any one Cau&s;e to cen|&s;ure it as the Effect of a too partial and injudicious Kindne&s;s for the Parents of one whom he <HI>delighteth to honour.</HI></P>
<P>My dear Ma&s;ter (why &s;hould I not &s;till call him &s;o, bound to reverence him as I am, in every Light that he can &s;hine in to the mo&s;t obliged and &s;en&s;ible Heart?) holds his kind Purpo&s;e of fitting up the large Parlour and three Apartments in the commodious Dwelling he calls yours, for his Entertainment and mine, when he &s;hall permit me to pay my Duty to you both, for a few happy Days together; and he has actually given Orders for that Purpo&s;e; and that the three Apartments be &s;o fitted up, as to be rather &s;uitable to <HI>your</HI> Condition, than his <HI>own</HI>; for, he &s;ays, the plain &s;imple Elegance which he will have to be ob&s;erved in the Rooms as well as the Furni|ture, will be a Variety in his Retirement to this Place, that will make him return to his own with the greater Plea&s;ure; and at the &s;ame time, when we are not there, will be of U&s;e for the Reception of any of your Friends; and &s;o he &s;hall not, as he kindly &s;ays, rob the good Couple of any of their Accom|modations.</P>
<P>The old Bow-windows he will have pre&s;erv'd, but will not have them &s;a&s;h'd, nor the Wood|binds, Je&s;&s;amines and Vines that run up again&s;t them, de&s;troyed; only he will have larger Panes of Gla&s;s, and convenienter Ca&s;ements, to let in more of the &s;weet Air and Light, to make amends for that ob&s;tructed by the Shades of tho&s;e fragrant Climbers. For he has mention'd three or four times, how gratefully they di&s;pens'd their intermingled Odours to us, when, the la&s;t Evening, we &s;tood at the Window in our Bed-chamber, to hear the re|&s;pon&s;ive
<PB N="3" REF="8">
Songs of two warbling Nightingales, one at a Di&s;tance, the other near, which took up our de|lighted Attention for above two Hours, and charm'd us the more, as we thought their Sea&s;on had been over. And when they had done, he made <HI>me</HI> &s;ing him one, and called me for it, the &s;weete&s;t of all Nightingales, &s;aying, How greatly do the innocent Plea&s;ures I now hourly ta&s;te, exceed the guilty Tu|mults that u&s;ed formerly to agitate my unequal Mind! Never talk, my <HI>Pamela,</HI> as you frequently do, of Obligation to me: One &s;uch Hour as I now enjoy, is an ample Reward for all the Benefits I can confer on you and yours in my whole Life!</P>
<P>The Parlour indeed will be more elegant, tho' that is to be rather plain than rich, as well in its Wain&s;cot as Furniture, and to be new floor'd. The dear Gentleman has already given Orders about it, and you will &s;oon have Workmen with you to put them in Execution. The Parlour Doors are to have Bra&s;s Hinges and Locks, and to &s;hut as clo&s;e, he tells them, as a Watch-ca&s;e: For who knows, &s;aid he, my Dear, but we &s;hall have &s;till added Ble&s;&s;ings, in two or three charming Boys and Girls, to place there in their In|fancy, before they can be of Age to be benefited by your Le&s;&s;ons and Example? And be&s;ides, I make no doubt, but I &s;hall entertain there &s;ome of my cho&s;en Friends, in their Excur&s;ions, for a Day or &s;o.</P>
<P>How am I, every Hour of my Life, overwhelm'd with In&s;tances of God Almighty's Goodne&s;s and his! &mdash; O &s;pare, ble&s;&s;ed Father of Mercies, the pre|cious Life of this excellent Gentleman! and increa&s;e my Thankfulne&s;s, and my Worthine&s;s; and then&mdash; But what &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;Only that then I may <HI>continue</HI> to be what I am; for more ble&s;s'd and more happy, in my own Mind, &s;urely I cannot be.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="9">The Beds he will have of Cloth, becau&s;e he thinks the Situation a little cold, e&s;pecially when the Wind is Ea&s;terly, and becau&s;e he purpo&s;es to be down in the early Spring Sea&s;on now-and-then, as well as in the latter Autumn; and the Win|dow Curtains of the &s;ame, in one Room red, in the other green; but plain, le&s;t you &s;hould be afraid to u&s;e them occa&s;ionally. The Carpets for them will come down with the other Furniture; for he will nor alter the old Oaken Floors of the Bed-cham|ber, nor yet of the little Room he intends for my U&s;e, to withdraw to, when I chu&s;e not to join in &s;uch Company as may happen to fall in: Which, my Dear, &s;ays he, &s;hall be as little as is po&s;&s;ible, only par|ticular Friends, who may be di&s;po&s;ed once in a Year or two, to &s;ee, when I am there, how I live with my <HI>Pamela,</HI> and her Parents, and how I pa&s;s my Time in my Retirement, as I &s;hall call this: For otherwi&s;e, perhaps, they will be apt to think I am a&s;ham'd of Company I &s;hall always be plea&s;ed with.&mdash;Nor are you, my Dear, continued he, to take this as a Compli|ment to your&s;elf, but a Piece of requi&s;ite Policy in me; for who will offer to reproach me for marrying, as the World thinks, below me, when they &s;hall &s;ee, that &s;uch a Reproach, as they would intend it, is &s;o far from being &s;o to me, that every Day of my Life, I not only pride my&s;elf in my <HI>Pamela,</HI> but take Plea&s;ure in owning her Relations as mine, and vi&s;it|ing them, and receiving Vi&s;its from them; and yet offer not to &s;et them up in &s;uch a glaring Light, as if I would have the World forget (who in that Ca&s;e would always take the more Plea&s;ure in remembering) what they were? And how will it anticipate low Reflection, when they &s;hall &s;ee, I can bend my Mind to partake with them the Plea&s;ures of their humble, but decent Life?&mdash;Ay, continued he, and
<PB N="5" REF="10">
be rewarded for it too, with better Health, better Spirits, and a better Mind; &s;o that, my Dear, added he, I &s;hall reap more Benefit by what I propo&s;e to do, than I &s;hall confer.</P>
<P>In this generous manner does this be&s;t of Gentle|men endeavour to di&s;claim tho' I mu&s;t be very un|grateful, if, with me, it did not inhance the proper Merit of a Beneficence that is natural to him; and which indeed, as I tell him, may be in one re&s;pect depreciated, ina&s;much as (&s;o excellent is his Nature) he cannot help it, if he would.&mdash;O that it was in my Power to recompen&s;e him for it! But I am poor, as I have often &s;aid, in every thing but Will &mdash; and that is <HI>wholly</HI> his: &mdash; And what a Happine&s;s is it to me, a <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> I could not &s;o early have hoped for, that I can &s;ay &s;o without <HI>Re&s;erve</HI>; &s;ince the dear Gentleman requires nothing of me, but what is con|&s;i&s;tent with my Duty to the &s;upreme Benefactor, the fir&s;t Mover and Cau&s;e of all his own Happine&s;s, of my Happine&s;s, and of that of my dear, my ever dear Parents!</P>
<P>But whither does the inchanting Subject lead me! I am running on to my u&s;ual Length, tho' I have not the &s;ame Excu&s;e for it; for heretofore I had nothing to do but to write. Yet, I am &s;ure, if I do exceed a little, <HI>you</HI> will be plea&s;ed with it; and you have moreover a Right to rejoice with me in the Days of my Felicity, after your indulgent Hearts had been &s;o much pained by a long Succe&s;&s;ion of my Fears and my Dangers, which only ought to be remember'd now, as Subjects of thankful Exultation, by</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Daughter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Need not repeat to you the Sen&s;e your good Mo|ther and I have of our Happine&s;s, and of our Obliga|tions to your honoured Spou&s;e: You both were plea&s;ed Witne&s;&s;es of it every Hour of the happy Fortnight you pa&s;&s;ed with us. But &s;till, my Dear, we hardly know how to addre&s;s our&s;elves even to <HI>You,</HI> much le&s;s to the <HI>'Squire,</HI> with the Freedom he &s;o often in|vited us to take: For, I don't know how it is, but tho' you are our Daughter, and are &s;o far from being lifted up by your high Condition, that we &s;ee no Difference in your Behaviour to us your poor Pa|rents; yet, when we look upon you as the Lady of &s;o fine a Gentleman, we cannot forbear having a kind of Re&s;pect, and &mdash; I don't know what to call it,&mdash; that lays a little Re&s;traint upon us! And yet we would not, methinks, let our Minds be run away with the Admiration of worldly Grandeur, &s;o, as to &s;et too much by it.</P>
<P>But your Merit, and your Prudence, my dear Daughter, is &s;o much above all we could ever have any Notion of it:&mdash;And to have Gentry come only to behold you, and admire you, not &s;o much for your Genteelne&s;s and Amiablene&s;s neither, as for your Behaviour, and your Affability to Poor as well as Rich, and to hear every one calling you an Angel, and &s;aying, you <HI>de&s;erve</HI> to be what you are; makes us hardly know how to look upon you but as an Angel indeed! I am &s;ure you have been a good Angel to us!&mdash;Since, for your &s;ake, God Almighty has put it into your honour'd Husband's Heart, to make us the happie&s;t Couple in the World: But little
<PB N="7" REF="12">
le&s;s, indeed, we &s;hould have been, had we only, in &s;ome far di&s;tant Land, heard of our dear Child's Hap|pine&s;s, and never partaken of the Benefits of it our|&s;elves. But thus to be provided for!&mdash;Thus kindly to be owned, and called Father and Mother by &s;uch a brave Gentleman, and thus to be placed, that we have nothing to do, but to ble&s;s God, and ble&s;s him, and ble&s;s you, and hourly pray for you <HI>both,</HI> is &s;uch a Providence, my dear Child, as is too mighty to be borne by us, with Equalne&s;s of Temper; and we kneel together every Morning, Noon and Night, and weep and rejoice, and rejoice and weep, to think how our Unworthine&s;s is di&s;tingui&s;hed, and how God has provided for us in our latter Days, when all we had to fear, was, that as we grew older and more infirm, and worn out by hard Labour, we &s;hould be trouble&s;ome, where, not our Pride, but our indu&s;trious Wills, would have made us wi&s;h not to be &s;o;&mdash;but to be intitled to a happier Lot: For this would have grieved us the more, for the &s;ake of you, my dear Child, and your un|happy Brother's Children; for it is well known, that, tho' we pretend not to boa&s;t of our Family, and indeed had no Rea&s;on, yet none of us were ever &s;unk &s;o low as I was:&mdash;To be &s;ure, partly by my own Fault; for had it been for your poor aged Mother's &s;ake only, I ought not to have done what I did for <HI>John</HI> and <HI>William</HI>; for, &s;o unhappy were they, poor Lads, that what I could do, was but as a Drop of Water to a Bucket.</P>
<P>But yet the I&s;&s;ue has &s;hewn, that (if I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o) what I did, was not di&s;plea&s;ing to God; ina&s;much as I have the Comfort to &s;ee, that my Reliance on Him, while I was doing what though &s;ome thought <HI>imprudent</HI> Things, yet not <HI>wrong</HI> Things, is &s;o abundantly rewarded, beyond
<PB N="8" REF="13">
Expectation and De&s;ert. Ble&s;&s;ed be his holy Name for it!</P>
<P>You command me&mdash;Let me, as writing to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Lady, &s;ay <HI>command,</HI> tho', as to my dear <HI>Daughter,</HI> I will only &s;ay <HI>de&s;ire</HI>: And indeed I will not, as you wi&s;h'd me not to do, let the one Condition, which was accidental, put the other, which was natural, out of my Thought: You &s;poke it in better Words, but this was the Sen&s;e &mdash; But you have the Gift of Utterance; and Education is a fine thing, where it meets with &s;uch Talents to improve upon as God has given you.&mdash;But let me not forget what I was going to &s;ay &mdash; You <HI>command</HI> &mdash; or, if you plea&s;e&mdash;you de&s;ire me to write long Letters, and often&mdash;And how can I help it, if I would? For when here, in this happy Dwelling, and this well-&s;tock'd Farm, in the&s;e rich Meadows, and well-cropt Acres, we look around us, and, which Way &s;oever we turn our Heads, &s;ee Ble&s;&s;ings upon Ble&s;&s;ings, and Plenty upon Plenty; &s;ee Barns well-&s;tor'd, Poultry increa&s;ing, the Kine lowing and crouding about us, and all fruitful; and are bid to call all the&s;e our own&mdash;And then think; that all is the Reward of our Child's Virtue!&mdash;O my dear Daughter, who can bear the&s;e Things!&mdash;Ex|cu&s;e me&mdash;I mu&s;t break off a little, for my Eyes are as full as my Heart; and I will retire to ble&s;s God and your honoured Husband.</P>
<P>So&mdash;my dear Child&mdash;I now again take up my Pen &mdash;But reading what I had written, in order to carry on the Thread, I can hardly forbear again being in like &s;ort affected.&mdash;But do you think I will call all the&s;e Things my own!&mdash;Do you think I will live Rent-free!&mdash;Do you think I would? Can the ho|noured 'Squire believe, that having &s;uch a generous
<PB N="9" REF="14">
Example before me, if I had no Gratitude in my Temper before, I could help being touched by &s;uch an one as he &s;ets me?&mdash;If his Goodne&s;s makes him know no Mean in giving, &s;hall I be &s;o greedy as to know none in receiving?&mdash;Come, come, my dear Child, your poor Father is not &s;o &s;ordid a Wretch neither. He will &s;hew the World, that all the&s;e Benefits are not thrown away upon one, who will di&s;grace you as much by his Temper, as by his Con|dition: What tho' I cannot be as worthy of all the&s;e Favours as I wi&s;h? I will be as worthy as I can. And let me tell you, my dear Child, if the King and his Royal Family (God ble&s;s 'em!) be not a&s;hamed to receive Taxes and Duties from his Subjects; if Dukes and Earls, and all the top Gentry, cannot &s;upport their Bravery, without having their Rents paid; I hope I &s;hall not affront the 'Squire, to pay to his Steward, what any other Per&s;on would pay for this noble Stock and improving Farm: And I will do it, an' it plea&s;e God to ble&s;s me with Life and Health.&mdash; I &s;hould not be worthy to crawl on the Earth, if I did not. And what did I &s;ay to Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> the faithful Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>? &s;ure no Gentleman had ever a more worthy Steward than he: It was as we were walking over the Grounds together&mdash;and ob&s;erving in what good Order every thing was; he was prai&s;|ing &s;ome little Contrivances of my own, for the Im|provement of the Farm, and &s;aying how comfortably he hoped we might live upon it. Ay, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> &s;aid I, comfortably indeed: But do you think I could be properly &s;aid to <HI>live,</HI> if I was not to pay as much Rent for it as another?&mdash;I can tell you, &s;aid he, the 'Squire will not receive any thing from you, Good|man <HI>Andrews.</HI>&mdash;Why, Man, he has no Occa&s;ion for it: He's worth a Power of Money, be&s;ides a noble and clear E&s;tate in Land.&mdash;Adsheartlikins, you
<PB N="10" REF="15">
mu&s;t not affront him, I can tell you that: For he's as generous as a Prince where he takes; but he is ha&s;ty, and will have his own way.&mdash;Why, for that Rea&s;on, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> &s;aid I, I was thinking to make <HI>you</HI> my Friend. &mdash; Make <HI>me</HI> your Friend! You have not a better in the World, to my Power, I can tell you that; nor your Dame neither; for I love &s;uch hone&s;t Hearts: I wi&s;h my own Brother would let me love him as well; but let that pa&s;s.&mdash;What I can do for you, I will, and here's my Hand upon it.</P>
<P>Well then, &s;aid I, it is this: Let me account to you at the Rent Farmer <HI>Dickins</HI> offered, and let me know what the Stock co&s;t, and what the Crops are valued at; and pay the one as I can, and the other Quarterly; and not let the 'Squire know it till you can't chu&s;e; and I &s;hall be as happy as a Prince; for I doubt not, by God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to make a comfortable Liveli|hood of it, be&s;ides.&mdash;Why, do&s;t believe, Goodman <HI>Andrews,</HI> &s;aid he, I would do &s;uch a thing?&mdash;Would not his Honour think, if I hid one thing from him, I might not hide another?&mdash;Go to, go to, hone&s;t Heart, I love thee dearly: But can the 'Squire do too much for his Lady, think'&s;t thou? Come, come, (and he jeer'd me &s;o, I could not tell what to &s;ay to him) I wi&s;h at Bottom there is not &s;ome Pride in this;&mdash;what, I warrant, you would not be too much beholden to his Honour, would you?&mdash;No, good Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> &s;aid I, &mdash; it is not that, I'm &s;ure. If I have any Pride, it is only, in my dear Child&mdash;to whom, under God, all this is owing!&mdash;But &s;ome how or other it &s;hall be &s;o.</P>
<P>And &s;o, my dear Daughter, I re&s;olve it &s;hall; and it will be, over and above, one of the greate&s;t Plea|&s;ures to me, to do the good 'Squire Service, as well as to be &s;o much benefited and obliged by him.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;hew'd your Letter to my Be&s;t-beloved. &mdash;Don't be unea&s;y that I have;&mdash;for you need not be a&s;hamed of it, &s;ince it is my Pride to have &s;uch hone&s;t and grateful Parents: And I'll tell you what he &s;aid to it, as the be&s;t Argument I can u&s;e why you &s;hould not be unea&s;y, but enjoy without Pain or Anxiety all the Benefits of your happy Lot.</P>
<P>Dear, good Souls! &s;aid he, how does every thing they &s;ay, and every thing they write, manife&s;t the Worthine&s;s of their Hearts! No Wonder, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you love and revere &s;uch hone&s;t Minds; for that you would do, were they not your Parents: And tell them, that I am &s;o far from having them believe that what I have done for them, is only the Effect of my Affection for their Daughter, that let 'em find out another Couple, as worthy as them&s;elves, and I will do as much for them. Indeed I would not place them, continued the dear Obliger, in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> County, becau&s;e I would wi&s;h <HI>two</HI> Counties to be ble&s;t for their &s;akes. Tell them, my Dear, that they have a Right to what they enjoy on the foot of their own <HI>proper</HI> Merit; and <HI>bid</HI> them enjoy it as their Patri|mony: And if there can any thing ari&s;e, that is more than they them&s;elves can wi&s;h for, in the way of Life they chu&s;e to live, let them look round among their own Relations, where it may be accept|able, and communicate to them the like &s;olid Rea|sons for rejoicing in the Situation they are plea&s;ed with: And do you, my Dear, continued he, &s;till further enable them, as you &s;hall judge proper, to gratify their inlarged Hearts, for fear they &s;hould deny any Comfort to them&s;elves, in order to do good to others.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="18">I could only fly to his generous Bo&s;om, (for this is a Subject which mo&s;t affects me) and, with my Eyes &s;wimming in Tears of grateful Joy, and which overflow'd as &s;oon as my bold Lips touch'd his dear Face, ble&s;s God and him with my whole Heart; for &s;peak I could not! &mdash; But, almo&s;t choak'd with my Joy, &s;obb'd to him my grateful Acknowledgment&mdash; He cla&s;ped me in his Arms; and &s;aid, How, my Deare&s;t, do you overpay me for the little I have done for your Parents! If it be thus to be ble&s;s'd for conferring Benefits &s;o in&s;ignificant to a Man of my Fortune, what Joys is it not in the Power of rich Men to give them&s;elves, whenever they plea&s;e!&mdash; Foreta&s;tes, indeed, of tho&s;e we are bid to hope for; which can &s;urely only exceed the&s;e, as <HI>then</HI> we &s;hall be all Intellect, and better fitted to receive them!&mdash; 'Tis too much!&mdash;too much! &s;aid I, in broken Accents:&mdash;How am I oppre&s;&s;ed with the Plea|&s;ure you give me!&mdash;Oh, Sir,&mdash;ble&s;s me more gradually, and more cautiou&s;ly&mdash;for I cannot bear it! And indeed, my Heart went flutter, flutter, flutter, at his dear Brea&s;t, as if it wanted to break its too narrow Pri&s;on, to mingle &s;till more intimately with his own.</P>
<P>Surely, &s;urely, my dear, my beloved Parents, no|body's Happine&s;s is &s;o great as mine!&mdash;If it pro|ceeds thus from Degree to Degree, and is to be aug|mented by the Hope, the charming Hope, that the dear &s;econd Author of your Ble&s;&s;ings and mine, be the uniformly good as well as the partially kind Man to us, what a Felicity will this be! And if our Prayers &s;hall be heard, and we &s;hall have the Plea&s;ure to think, that his Advances in Piety are owing not a little to them, and to the Example God &s;hall give us Grace to &s;et; then, indeed, may we take the Pride to think, we have repaid his Goodne&s;s to us, and that we have &s;atisfied the Debt, which nothing le&s;s can di&s;charge.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="19">Thus, then, do I &s;et before you imperfectly, as I am forced to do, the Delight your grateful, your ho|ne&s;t Hearts give us. I &s;ay, imperfectly, and well I may; for I might as ea&s;ily paint Sound, as de&s;cribe the noble, the &s;ublime Plea&s;ures that wind up my Affections to even a painful Height of Rapture, on &s;uch Occa&s;ions as this: And I de&s;ire, as he often bids <HI>me,</HI> that you will take to your&s;elves the Merit of thus delighting us both, and then think with le&s;s Unea&s;ine&s;s of the Obligation you are un|der to the be&s;t of Friends!&mdash;And indeed it is but doing Ju&s;tice to his beneficent Temper, to think, that we have given him an Opportunity of exerci&s;ing it, in a way &s;o agreeable to it; and I can tell by the Ar|dour of his Speech, by the additional Lu&s;tre that it lights up in his Eyes, naturally &s;o lively, and by the virtuous Endearments, refined on the&s;e Occa&s;ions above what Sen&s;e can know, that he has a Plea&s;ure, a Joy, a Tran&s;port, in doing what he does of this &s;ort, that is its own Reward; as every virtuous and noble Ac|tion mu&s;t be to a Mind that can be delighted with Virtue for its own &s;ake, and can find it&s;elf inlarged by the Power of doing Good to worthy Objects. Even I, my dear Parents, know this by Experience, when I can be an humble Means to make an hone&s;t Creature happy, tho' not related to my&s;elf; and yet I am but a Third-hand Di&s;pen&s;er, as I have <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 388.</NOTE>el&s;ewhere &s;aid, of the&s;e Comforts; and all the Light I can com|municate, as I once before ob&s;erved<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 257.</NOTE>, like that of the Moon, is but borrowed from his &s;unny Radiance.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my dear, my worthy Parents, if my Style on this Subject be rai&s;ed above that natu|ral Simplicity which is more &s;uited to my humble Talents. But how can I help it? For when the Mind is elevated, ought not the Sen&s;e we have of our Happine&s;s, to make our Expre&s;&s;ions &s;oar
<PB N="15" REF="20">
equally? Can the Affections be &s;o highly rai&s;ed as mine are on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, and the Thoughts creep, groveling, like one's ordinary Self? No, in|deed! &mdash;Call not this, therefore, the Gift of Ut|terance, if it &s;hould appear to you in a better Light than it de&s;erves. It is the Gift of Gratitude! A Gift which makes you and me too, <HI>&s;peak</HI> and <HI>write,</HI> as I hope it will make us <HI>act,</HI> above our|&s;elves! &mdash;And thus will our Gratitude be the In&s;pirer of Joy to our common Benefactor; and his Joy will heighten our Gratitude; and &s;o we &s;hall proceed, as Cau&s;e and Effect to each other's Happine&s;s, to ble&s;s the dear Gentleman that ble&s;&s;es us.&mdash;And will it be right then to &s;ay, you are &s;o unea&s;y under &s;uch (at lea&s;t as to your Wills) returned and di&s;charged Obliga|tions? God Almighty requires only a thankful Heart for all the Mercies he heaps upon the Children of Men: My dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> who, in the&s;e Particu|lars, imitates Divinity, de&s;ires no more:&mdash;You <HI>have</HI> this thankful Heart;&mdash;yes, you have; and that to &s;uch a high Degree of Gratitude, that nobody can exceed you.</P>
<P>But yet, my dear Parents, when your worthy Minds would be too much affected with your Grati|tude, &s;o as to lay you under the Re&s;traints you mention, to the dear Gentleman, and, for his &s;ake, to your dependent Daughter; then let me humbly advi&s;e you, that you will at &s;uch Times, with more particular, more ab&s;tracted A&s;pirations, than at others, rai&s;e your Thoughts upwards, and con&s;ider who it is that gives <HI>him</HI> the Opportunity; and pray for him, and for me; for <HI>him,</HI> that all his future Actions may be of a Piece with this noble Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind; for <HI>me,</HI> that I may continue humble, and con&s;ider my&s;elf ble&s;t for your &s;akes, and in order that I may be, in &s;ome &s;ort, a Rewarder in the Hands of Providence of this its dear excellent Agent; and
<PB N="16" REF="21">
then we &s;hall look forward all of us with Plea&s;ure indeed to that State, where there is no Di&s;tinction of Degree, and where the humble Cottager &s;hall be upon a Par with the proude&s;t Monarch.</P>
<P>O my dear, dear Parents! how can you, as in your <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> &s;ay &mdash; May we not be <HI>favoured</HI> now-and-then with a Letter? Call <HI>me</HI> your Daughter, your <HI>Pamela</HI> &mdash; I am no Lady to you. &mdash; I have more Plea&s;ure to be called your Comfort, and to be thought to act worthy of the Sentiments with which your Examples, Cautions and In&s;tructions have in&s;pired me, than in any one thing in this Life, my deter|mined Duty to our common Benefactor, the be&s;t of Gentlemen and Husbands, excepted. And I am &s;ure, God has ble&s;&s;ed me for your &s;akes, and has thus an|&s;wered for me all your Prayers; nay, <HI>more</HI> than an|&s;wered all you or I could have wi&s;hed or hoped for. We only prayed, only hoped, that God would pre|&s;erve <HI>you</HI> hone&s;t, and <HI>me</HI> virtuous: And &s;ee, O &s;ee, my excellent Parents! how we are crown'd with Ble&s;&s;ings upon Ble&s;&s;ings, till we are the Talk of all that know us: &mdash; You for your Hone&s;ty! I for my Humility and Virtue! &mdash; that Virtue which God's Grace in&s;pired, and your Examples and Le&s;&s;ons, with tho&s;e of my dear good Lady, cultivated; and which now have left me nothing to do but to reap all the Rewards which this Life can afford; and if I walk humbly, and improve my ble&s;&s;ed Opportunities, will heighten and perfect all in a &s;till more joyful Fu|turity!&mdash;</P>
<P>Hence, my dear Parents, (I mean, from the De|light I have in writing to you, a Delight which tran&s;|ports me &s;o much above my own Sphere) you'll &s;ee that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> write to you, and cannot help it, if I would. And <HI>will</HI> it be a great Joy to you!&mdash;And is there any thing that can add to your Joy, think you, that is in the Power of your <HI>Pamela,</HI> that &s;he would
<PB N="17" REF="22">
not <HI>do</HI>! &mdash; O that the Lives and Healths of my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my deare&s;t Parents, may be continued to me! And who then can be &s;o ble&s;t as your <HI>Pamela?</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>will</HI> write; <HI>depend</HI> upon it, I will &mdash; on every Occa&s;ion: &mdash;And you augment my Joys, to think it is in my Power to add to your Comforts. Nor can you conceive the Plea&s;ure I have in hoping, that this your new happy Lot, may, by relieving you from corroding Care, and the too wearing Effects of hard Labour, add, in the&s;e your advanced Years, to both your Days! &mdash; For &s;o happy am I, I can have no Grief, no Pain, in looking forward, but from &s;uch Thoughts as remind me, that one Day, either you from me, or I from you, mu&s;t be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>But 'tis fit that we &s;o comport our&s;elves, as that we &s;hould not imbitter our pre&s;ent Happine&s;s with Pro&s;pects too gloomy &mdash; but bring our Minds to be chearfully thankful for the pre&s;ent, wi&s;e|ly to enjoy that <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> as we go along, &mdash; and at la&s;t, when all is to be wound up, lie down, and &s;ay, <HI>Not mine,</HI> but <HI>thy Will be done!</HI></P>
<P>But I have written a great deal; yet have much &s;till to &s;ay, relating to other Parts of your kind, your acceptable Letter; and &s;o will &s;oon write again: For I mu&s;t think every Opportunity happy, whereby I can a&s;&s;ure you, how much I am, and will ever be, without any Addition to my Name, if that will make you ea&s;ier,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your dutiful <HI>PAMELA.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Father and Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Now write again, as I told you I &s;hould in my la&s;t &mdash;But I am half afraid to look back on the Copy of it; for your worthy Hearts, &s;o vi&s;ible in your
<PB N="18" REF="23">
Letter, and my be&s;t Beloved's kind Deportment upon &s;hewing it to him, rai&s;ed me into a Frame of Mind, that was bordering on Ec&s;ta&s;y: Yet am I &s;ure, I wrote my Heart. But you mu&s;t not, my dear Father, write to your poor <HI>Pamela</HI> &s;o affect|ingly. Your <HI>&s;teadier</HI> Mind could hardly bear your own moving Strain, and you was forced to lay down your Pen, and retire: How then could I, who love you &s;o dearly, if you had not, if I may &s;o &s;ay, <HI>in|crea&s;ed</HI> that Love by fre&s;h and &s;tronger In&s;tances of your Worthine&s;s, forbear being affected, and rai&s;ed above my&s;elf?&mdash;But I will not again touch upon this Subject.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that my deare&s;t Spou&s;e commands me, with his kind Re&s;pects, to tell you, that he has thought of a Method to make your <HI>wor|thy Hearts</HI> ea&s;y; tho&s;e were his Words&mdash;And this is, &s;aid he, by putting that who&s;e E&s;tate, with the new Purcha&s;e, under your Father's Care, as I at fir&s;t in|tended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 341.</NOTE>; and he &s;hall receive and pay, and order every thing as he plea&s;es, and <HI>Longman,</HI> who grows in Years, &s;hall be ea&s;ed of that Burden. Your Fa|ther writes, &s;aid he, a very legible Hand, and he &s;hall take what A&s;&s;i&s;tants he plea&s;es: And do you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;ee to that, that this new Task may be made as ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to him as po&s;&s;ible. He &s;hall make up his Accounts only to you, my Dear. And there will be &s;everal Plea&s;ures ari&s;e to me upon it, conti|nued he: Fir&s;t, That it will be a Relief to ho|ne&s;t <HI>Longman,</HI> who has Bu&s;ine&s;s enough on his Hands be&s;ides. Next, It will make the good Couple ea&s;y, that they have an Opportunity of en|joying that as their Due, which now their too grateful Hearts give them &s;o many cau&s;ele&s;s Scruples about&punc;
<PB N="19" REF="24">
Thirdly, it will employ your Father's Time, more &s;uit|ably to <HI>your</HI> Liking, and <HI>mine,</HI> becau&s;e with more Ea&s;e to him&s;elf; for you &s;ee his indu&s;trious Will can|not be &s;atisfied without doing &s;omething. In the fourth Place, the Management of this E&s;tate will gain him more Re&s;pect and Reverence among the Tenants and his Neighbours; and yet be all in his own way. &mdash;For, my Dear, added he, you'll &s;ee, that it is al|ways one Point in View with me, to endeavour to convince every one, that I e&s;teem and value them for their own intrin&s;ick Merit, and want not any body to di&s;tingui&s;h them in any other Light than that in which they have been accu&s;tomed to appear.</P>
<P>So, my dear Father, the In&s;trument will be drawn, and brought you by hone&s;t Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> who will be with you in a few Days, to put the la&s;t Hand to the new Purcha&s;e, and to give you Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your new Commi&s;&s;ion, if you plea&s;e to accept it; as I hope you will; and the rather, for my dear Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s third Rea&s;on; and becau&s;e I know, that this Tru&s;t will be di&s;charged as worthily and as &s;ufficiently, after you are u&s;ed to it, as if Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> him&s;elf was in it &mdash; And better it cannot be Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> is very fond of this Relief, and longs to be down to &s;ettle every thing with you, as to the proper Powers, the Method, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &mdash;and he &s;ays, in his u&s;ual way of Phra&s;ing, that he'll make it as ea&s;y to you as a Glove.</P>
<P>If you do accept it, my be&s;t Beloved will leave every thing to you, as to Rent, where not already fixed, and likewi&s;e as to Acts of Kindne&s;s and Fa|vour to be done where you think proper; and he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That, with all his bad Qualities, he was ever deemed a kind Landlord; and this I can confirm in fifty In&s;tances to his Honour: So that the old Gentleman, &s;aid he, need not be afraid of being put upon &s;evere or har&s;h Methods of Proceeding, where Things will do without; and he'll always have it in
<PB N="20" REF="25">
his Power to befriend an hone&s;t Man: So that the Province will be intirely &s;uch a one as &s;uits with his Inclination. If any thing difficult or perplexing ari&s;es, continued he, or where a little Knowledge in Law-matters is nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Longman</HI> &s;hall do all that: And your Father will &s;ee, that he will not have in tho&s;e Points a Coadjutor that will be too hard-hearted for his Wi&s;h: For it was a Rule my Father &s;et me, and I have &s;trictly followed, that tho' I have a Lawyer for my Steward, it was rather to know how to do <HI>right</HI> Things, than <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive</HI> ones; and <HI>Longman</HI> has &s;o well an&s;wered this Intention, that he was always more noted for compo&s;ing Differences, than promoting Law-&s;uits.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, my dear Father, this will be an accept|able Employment to you, on the &s;everal Accounts my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to mention: And what a charming Contrivance is here!&mdash;God for|ever ble&s;s his con&s;iderate Heart for it!&mdash;To make you u&s;eful to him, and ea&s;y to your&s;elf; as well as re&s;pected by, and even a Benefactor to all around you! What can one &s;ay to all the&s;e Things?&mdash;But what &s;ignifies exulting in one's Gratitude for <HI>one</HI> Benefit!&mdash; Every Hour the dear Gentleman heaps new ones upon us, and we have hardly Time to thank him for one, but a &s;econd, and a third, and &s;o on to countle&s;s Degrees, confound one, and throw back one's Words upon one's Heart before they are well formed, and oblige one to &s;it down under all with profound Silence and Admiration.</P>
<P>As to what you mention of the De&s;ire of Cou&s;in <HI>Thomas,</HI> and <HI>Roger,</HI> to come to live with you, I en|deavoured to &s;ound what our dear Benefactor's Opi|nion was. He was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I have nothing to chu&s;e in this Ca&s;e, my Dear. Your Father is his own Ma&s;ter: He may employ whom he plea&s;es; and, if they are not wanting in Re&s;pect to him and your
<PB N="21" REF="26">
Mother, I think, as he rightly ob&s;erves, Relation|&s;hip &s;hould rather have the Preference; and as he can remedy Inconveniences, if he finds any, by all means let every Branch of your Family have Rea&s;on to rejoice with him.</P>
<P>But I have thought of this Matter a good deal, &s;ince I had the Favour of your Letter; and I hope, &s;ince you conde&s;cend to ask my Advice, you will ex|cu&s;e me, if I give it freely; yet intirely &s;ubmitting all to your own Liking.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, then, I think it would be bet|ter to have <HI>any body</HI> than Relations; and that for the&s;e Rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>One is apt to expect more Regard from Relations, and they more Indulgence, than Strangers can have Rea&s;on for.</P>
<P>That where there is &s;uch a Difference in the Ex|pectations of both, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible but Unea&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e.</P>
<P>That this will &s;ubject you to bear it, or to re&s;ent it, and to part with them. If you bear it, you will know no End of Impo&s;itions: If you di&s;mi&s;s them, it will ccca&s;ion Ill-will. They will call you unkind; and you them ungrateful; and as, it may be, your pro&s;perous Lot will rai&s;e you Enviers, &s;uch will be apt to believe <HI>them,</HI> rather than <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>Then the World will be inclined to think, that we are crouding upon a generous Gentleman, a nume|rous Family of indigent People; and tho' they may be ever &s;o de&s;erving, yet it will be &s;aid, The Girl is filling every Place with her Relations, and <HI>beleaguer|ing,</HI> as you &s;ignificantly expre&s;s it, a worthy Gentle|man. And this will be &s;aid, perhaps, &s;hould one's Kindred behave ever &s;o worthily; And &s;o,</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27">In the next Place, one would not, for <HI>their</HI> Sakes, that this &s;hould be done; who may live with <HI>le&s;s</HI> Re|proach, and <HI>equal</HI> Benefit, any-where el&s;e: For I would not wi&s;h any one of them to be lifted out of his Station, and made independent, at Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Expence, if their Indu&s;try will not do it; altho' I would never &s;cruple to do any thing rea&s;onable to promote or a&s;&s;i&s;t that Indu&s;try, in the way of their Callings.</P>
<P>Then it will po&s;&s;ibly put others of our Relations upon the &s;ame Expectations, of living with you; and this may occa&s;ion Ill-will among them, if &s;ome be preferred to others in your Favour.</P>
<P>Then, my dear Father, I apprehend, that our be|loved and honoured Benefactor would be under &s;ome Difficulty, from his natural Politene&s;s, and Regard for you and me.&mdash;You &s;ee how kindly, on all Occa&s;ions, he treats you both, not only as the Father and Mother of his <HI>Pamela,</HI> but as if you were his own Father and Mother: And if you had any body as your Servants there, who called you Cou|&s;in, or Grandfather, or Uncle, he would not care, when he came down, to treat them on the Foot of common Servants, tho' <HI>they</HI> might neverthele&s;s think them&s;elves honoured (as they would be, and as I am &s;ure I &s;hall always think <HI>my&s;elf</HI>) with his Commands. And would it not, if they are mo|de&s;t and worthy, be as great a Difficulty upon <HI>them,</HI> to be thus di&s;tingui&s;hed, as it would be to <HI>him,</HI> and to <HI>me,</HI> for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake? For otherwi&s;e, (believe me, I hope you will, my dear Father and Mother) I could &s;it down and rejoice with the meane&s;t and remote&s;t Relation I have. But in the World's Eye, to every body but my be&s;t of Parents, I mu&s;t, if I have ever &s;o much Re|luctance to it, appear in a Light that may not give Di&s;credit to his Choice.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="28">Then again, as I hinted, you will have it in your Power, without the lea&s;t Injury to our common Benefactor, to do kinder Things by any of our Relations, when <HI>not</HI> with you, than you can do, if they <HI>live</HI> with you.</P>
<P>You may lend them a little Money, to put them in a way, if any thing offers that you think will be to their Advantage. You can fit out my She-Cou&s;ins to good reputable Places.&mdash;The younger you can put to School, or, when fit, to Trades, ac|cording to their Talents, and &s;o they will be of cour&s;e in a way to get an hone&s;t and creditable Livelihood.</P>
<P>But, above all things, one would as much di&s;cou|rage as one could, &s;uch a proud and ambitious Spirit in any of them, as &s;hould want to ra&s;e it|&s;elf by Favour in&s;tead of Merit; and this the ra|ther, for that, undoubtedly, there are many more happy Per&s;ons in low than in high Life, take Number for Number, all the World over.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, altho' four or five Years of different Life had pa&s;&s;ed with me, I had &s;o much Pride and Plea&s;ure in the Thought of working for my Living with you, my dear Parents, if I could but get hone&s;t to you, that it made my Confinement the more grievous to me, and even, if po&s;&s;ible, aggravated the Apprehen|&s;ions attending it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t beg of you, not to harbour a Thought, that the&s;e my Rea&s;ons proceed from the bad Mo|tives of a Heart tainted with Pride on its high Condition. Indeed there can be no Rea&s;on for it, to one who thinks after this manner:&mdash;The greate&s;t Families on Earth have &s;ome among them who are unhappy, and low in Life; and &s;hall &s;uch an one reproach me with having twenty low Relations, be|cau&s;e they have, peradventure, not above Five? or with Ten, becau&s;e they have but one, or two, or

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Daughter,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW &s;hall I do to an&s;wer, as they de&s;erve, your two la&s;t Letters? Surely no happy Couple ever had &s;uch a Child as we have! But it is in vain to aim at Words like your Words; and equally in vain for us to offer to &s;et forth the Thankfulne&s;s of our Hearts, on the kind Office your honoured Husband has given us; for no Rea&s;on but to favour us &s;till more, and to quiet our Minds in the Notion of be|ing u&s;eful to him. God grant I may be able to be &s;o!&mdash;Happy &s;hall I be if I can! But I &s;ee the generous Drift of his Propo&s;al; it is only to make me more ea&s;y from the Nature of my Employment, and in my Mind too, overloaden, as I may &s;ay, with Benefits; and at the &s;ame time to make me more re&s;pected in my new Neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="31">I can only &s;ay, I mo&s;t gratefully accept of the kind Offer; and &s;ince it will ea&s;e the worthy Mr. <HI>Long|man,</HI> &s;hall with &s;till greater Plea&s;ure do all I can in it. But I doubt I &s;hall be wanting in Ability; I doubt I &s;hall: But I will be ju&s;t and hone&s;t, however. That, by God's Grace, will be within my own Capacity; and that, I hope, I may an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>It is kind, indeed, to put it in my Power to do good to tho&s;e who &s;hall de&s;erve it: And I will take <HI>double</HI> Pains to find out the true Merit of &s;uch as I &s;hall recommend to Favour, and that their Circum|&s;tances be really &s;uch as I &s;hall repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>But one thing, my dear Daughter, let me de&s;ire, that I may make up my Accounts to Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> or to his Honour him&s;elf, when he &s;hall make us &s;o happy as to be here with us. I don't know how&mdash;but it will make me unea&s;y, if I am to make up my Ac|counts to you: For &s;o well known is your Love to us, that tho' you would no more do an unju&s;t thing, than, by God's Grace, we &s;hould de&s;ire you; yet this &s;ame ill-willing World might think it was like making up Accounts to one's &s;elf.</P>
<P>Do, my deare&s;t Child, get me off of this Diffi|culty, and I <HI>can</HI> have no other; for already I am in Hopes I have hit upon a Contrivance to improve the E&s;tate, and to better the Condition of the Tenants at the &s;ame time, at lea&s;t, not to wor&s;t them, and which, I hope, will plea&s;e every body: But I will acquaint Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> with this, and take his Ad|vice; for I will not be too trouble&s;ome either to you, my dear Child, or to your Spou&s;e.&mdash; If I could act &s;o for his Intere&s;t, as not to be a Burden, what hap|py Creatures &s;hould we both be in our own Minds! We find our&s;elves more and more re&s;pected by every one; and, &s;o far as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with our new Tru&s;t, we will endeavour to de&s;erve it, that we may
<PB N="27" REF="32">
intere&s;t as many as know us in our own good Wi&s;hes and Prayers for both your Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But let me &s;ay, how much convinced I am by the Rea&s;ons you give for not taking to us any of our Relations. Every one of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons has its Force with us. How happy are we to have &s;o prudent a Daughter to advi&s;e with! And I think my&s;elf obliged to promi&s;e this, that whatever I do for any of them above the Amount of forty Shillings at one Time, I will take your Direction in it, that your wi&s;e Hints of making every one continue their Indu&s;try, and not to rely upon Favour in&s;tead of Merit, may be followed. I am &s;ure this is the way to make them <HI>happier,</HI> as well as <HI>better</HI> Men and Wo|men; for, as I have often thought, if one were to have a hundred Pounds a Year in good Comings-in, it would not do without Indu&s;try; and with it, one may do with a Quarter of it, and le&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear Child, your Rea&s;ons are &s;o good, that I wonder they came not into my Head before, and then I needed not to have troubled you about the Matter: But yet it ran in my own Thought, that I could not like to be an Incroacher:&mdash; For I hate a dirty thing; and in the mid&s;t of my Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, never could be guilty of one. Thank God for it.</P>
<P>You rejoice our Hearts beyond Expre&s;&s;ion at the Hope you give us of receiving Letters from you now-and-then: To be &s;ure it will be the chief Comfort of our Lives, next to &s;eeing you, as we are put in hope we &s;ometimes &s;hall. But yet, my dear Child, don't let us put you to Inconvenience neither. Pray don't! You'll have enough upon your Hands without &mdash; To be &s;ure you will.</P>
<P>The Workmen have made a good Progre&s;s, and wi&s;h for Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> to come down; as we al&s;o do.</P>
<P>You need not be afraid we &s;hould think you proud, or lifted up with your Condition. You have wea|thered

But I &s;hould be more than half-&s;tupid, I'm &s;ure, to aim at it.</P>
<P>Every Day brings us In&s;tances of the good Name his Honour and you, my dear Child, have left be|hind you in this Country. Here comes one, and here comes another, and a third and a fourth; and, Goodman <HI>Andrew,</HI> cries one, and, Goody <HI>Andrews,</HI> cries another &mdash; (and &s;ome call us Mr. and Mrs. but we like the other full as well) When heard you from his Honour? How does his Lady do? &mdash; What a charming Couple are they! &amp; How lovingly they live! &mdash; What an Example do they give to all about them! &mdash; Then one cries, God ble&s;s 'em both; and another cries, <HI>Amen</HI>; and &s;o &s;ays a third and a fourth; and all &s;ay, But when do you expect them down again? &amp; Such-a-one longs to &s;ee 'em; &amp; and &s;uch-a-one will ride a Day's Journey, to have but a Sight of 'em at Church. &amp; And then they &s;ay, how this Gentleman prai&s;es them, and that Lady admires them. &amp; O my dear Child! what a Happine&s;s is this! How do your poor Mother and I &s;tand fixed

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD intended to have been with you before this; but my Lord has been a little indi&s;po&s;ed with the Gout, and <HI>Jackey</HI> too has had an Intermittent Fever; but they are pretty well recovered, and it &s;hall not be long before I &s;ee you, now I under&s;tand you are re|turn'd from your <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Expedition.</P>
<P>We have been exceedingly diverted with your Pa|pers. You have given us, by their Means, many a delightful Hour, that otherwi&s;e would have hung heavy upon us; and we are all charm'd with you. Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> as well as her noble Mamma, has always been of our Party, whenever we have read your Ac|counts. She is a dear generous Lady, and has &s;hed many a Tear over them, as indeed we all have; and my Lord has not been unmov'd, nor <HI>Jackey</HI> neither, at &s;ome of your Di&s;tre&s;&s;es and Reflections. Indeed, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you are a charming Creature, and an Orna|ment to our Sex. We wanted to have had you among us an hundred times, as we read, that we might have lov'd, and ki&s;s'd, and thank'd you.</P>
<P>But after all, my Brother, generous and noble as he was, when your Trials were over, was a &s;trange wicked young Fellow; and happy it was for you both, that he was &s;o cleverly caught in the Trap he had laid for your Virtue.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure you, my Lord longs to &s;ee you, and will accompany me; for, he &s;ays, he has but a faint Idea of your Per&s;on. I tell him, and tell them all, that you are the fine&s;t Girl, and the mo&s;t improv'd in Per&s;on and Mind, I ever beheld; and I am nor afraid, altho' they &s;hould imagine all they can in your Favour,

<P>Lady <HI>Betty</HI> &s;ays, it is the be&s;t Story &s;he has heard, and the mo&s;t in&s;tructive; and &s;he longs to have the Conclu&s;ion of it in your own Words.

A Vi&s;it from my hone&s;t Father, who (not knowing what to conclude from the Letter I wrote to him before I returned to your honoured Brother, de&s;iring my Papers from him) came in great Anxiety of Heart to know the wor&s;t, doubting I had at la&s;t been caught by a Stratagem that had ended in my Ruin.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. From Lady <HI>DAVERS,</HI> in Reply.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have given us all a great Di&s;appointment, in declining to oblige me with the Sequel of your Papers. I was a little out of Humour with you at fir&s;t;&mdash;I mu&s;t own I was:&mdash;For I cannot bear De|nial, when my Heart is &s;et upon any thing. But Lady <HI>Betty</HI> became your Advocate, and &s;aid, She thought you very excu&s;able; &s;ince, no doubt, there might be many tender Things, circum&s;tanced as you was, which might be well enough for your Parents to &s;ee, but for nobody el&s;e; and Relations of our Side lea&s;t of all, who&s;e future Intimacy and frequent Vi&s;its, might give Occa&s;ions for Raillery and Remarks, that might not be always agreeable. I re|garded her Apology for you the more, becau&s;e I knew it was a great Balk to her, that you did not com|ply with my Reque&s;t. But now, Child, when you know me more, you'll find, that if I am oblig'd to give up one Point, I always in&s;i&s;t upon another, as near it as I can, in order to &s;ee if it be only <HI>one</HI> thing I am to be refu&s;ed, or <HI>every</HI> thing; in which la&s;t Ca&s;e I know how to take my Mea&s;ures, and re&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now then, this is what I in&s;i&s;t on; That you cor|re&s;pond with me in the &s;ame manner you did with your Parents, and acquaint me with every Pa&s;&s;age that is of Concern to you; beginning with your Ac|counts how you &s;pent your Time, both of you, when you were in <HI>Kent</HI>; for, you mu&s;t know, we are all taken with your Duty to your Parents, and the Di&s;cretion of the good Couple, and think you have given a very edifying Example of filial Piety to all who &s;hall hear your Story; for if &s;o much Duty is owing to Parents, where nothing can be done for one, how much more is it to be expected, where there
<PB N="38" REF="43">
is a Power to add to the natural Obligation, all the Comforts and Conveniences of Life? We People in upper Life, you mu&s;t know, love to hear how Grati|tude and unexpected Benefits operate upon hone&s;t Minds, who have little more than plain artle&s;s Na|ture for their Guide; and we flatter our&s;elves with the Hopes of many a delightful Hour, by your Means, in this our &s;olitary Situation, as it will be, if we are obliged to pa&s;s the next Winter in it, as my Lord and the Earl threaten me, and the Counte&s;s, and Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> that we &s;hall. Then let us hear of every thing that gives you Joy and Trouble: And if my Brother carries you to Town, for the Winter, while he attends Parliament, the Advices you will be able to give us of what pa&s;&s;es in <HI>London,</HI> and of the public Entertainments and Diver&s;ions he will take you to, as you will relate them from your own artle&s;s and natural Ob&s;ervations, will be as diverting to us, as if we were at them our&s;elves. For a young Crea|ture, of your good Under&s;tanding, to whom all the&s;e Things will be quite new, will give us, per|haps, a better Ta&s;te of them, their Beauties and De|fects, than we might have before. For we People of Quality go to tho&s;e Places, dre&s;s'd out and adorn'd, in &s;uch Manner, outvying one another, as if we con|&s;idered our&s;elves as &s;o many Parts of the public En|tertainment, and are too much plea&s;ed with our&s;elves to be able &s;o to attend to what we &s;ee, as to form a right Judgment of it: And, indeed, we, &s;ome of us, behave with &s;o much Indifference to the Entertain|ment, as if we thought our&s;elves above being di|verted by what we come to &s;ee, and as if our View was rather to trifle away our Time, than to improve our&s;elves, by attending to the Story or the Action.</P>
<P>See, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I &s;hall not make an unworthy Cor|re&s;pondent altogether; for I can get into thy grave Way, and moralize a little now-and-then: And if
<PB N="39" REF="44">
you'll promi&s;e to oblige me by your con&s;tant Corre|&s;pondence in this way, and dive&s;t your&s;elf of all Re&s;traint, as if you was writing to your Parents, (and I can tell you, you'll write to one who will be as candid and as favourable to you as they can be) then I am &s;ure we &s;hall have Truth and Nature from you; and the&s;e are Things which we are generally &s;o much lifted above, by our Conditions, that we hardly know what they are.</P>
<P>But I have written enough for one Letter: And yet, having more to &s;ay, I will, after this, &s;end another, without waiting for your An&s;wer, which you may give to both together; and am, mean time,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very glad thy hone&s;t Man has let thee into the Affair of <HI>Sally Godfrey.</HI> But pr'ythee, <HI>Pamela,</HI> give us an Account of the Manner in which he did it, and of thy Thoughts upon it; for that is a critical Ca&s;e; and according as he has repre&s;ented it, &s;o &s;hall I know what to &s;ay of it before you and him: For I would not make Mi&s;chief between you for the World.</P>
<P>This, let me tell you, will be a trying Part of your Conduct. For he loves the Child; and will judge of you by your Conduct towards it. He dear|ly loved her Mother; and, notwithstanding her Fault, &s;he well de&s;erv'd it: For &s;he was a &s;en&s;ible, ay, and a mode&s;t Lady, and of an ancient and genteel Family. But he was Heir to a noble E&s;tate, was of a bold and enterpri&s;ing Spirit, fond of Intrigue&mdash; Don't let this concern you.&mdash;You'll have the greater Happine&s;s and Merit too, if you can hold him&mdash;And
<PB N="40" REF="45">
'tis my Opinion, if any body can, you will.&mdash;Then he did not like the young Lady's Mother, who &s;ought artfully to intrap him. So that the poor Girl, divided between her Inclination for him, and her Duty to her de&s;igning Mother, gave into the Plot upon him; and he thought him&s;elf, vile Wretch as he was, for all that!&mdash;at Liberty to &s;et up Plot again&s;t Plot, and the poor Lady's Honour was the Sacrifice.</P>
<P>I hope you &s;poke well of her to him. I hope you received the Child kindly.&mdash;I hope you had Pre&s;ence of Mind to do this.&mdash;For it was a nice Part to act; and all his Ob&s;ervations were up, I dare &s;ay, on the Occa&s;ion. &mdash; Do, let me hear how it was. There's my good <HI>Pamela,</HI> do. And write, I charge you, freely and without Re&s;traint; for altho' I am not your Mother, yet am I <HI>his</HI> elder Si&s;ter, you know&mdash; and, as &s;uch&mdash;come, I will &s;ay &s;o, in hopes you'll oblige me&mdash;<HI>your</HI> Si&s;ter, and &s;o intitled to expect a Compliance with my Reque&s;t: For is there not a Duty, in degree, to elder Si&s;ters from younger?</P>
<P>As to our Remarks upon your Behaviour, they have been very much to your Credit, I can tell you that: But, neverthele&s;s, I will, to encourage you to enter into this reque&s;ted Corre&s;pondence with me, con&s;ult Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> and will go over your Papers again, and try to find fault with your Conduct; and if we can &s;ee any thing cen&s;urable, will freely let you know our Minds.</P>
<P>But, before-hand, I can tell you, we &s;hall be agreed in one Opinion; and that is, that we know not who would have acted as you have done, upon the Whole.</P>
<P>So, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you &s;ee I put my&s;elf upon the &s;ame Foot of Corre&s;pondence with you.&mdash;Not that I will promi&s;e to an&s;wer every Letter: No, you mu&s;t not expect that.&mdash;Your Part will be a kind of Nar|rative purpo&s;ely de&s;igned to entertain us here; and I
<PB N="41" REF="46">
hope to receive &s;ix, &s;even, eight or ten Letters, as it may happen, before I return one: But &s;uch a Part I will bear in it, as &s;hall let you know our Opinion of your Proceedings, and Relations of Things.&mdash; And as you wi&s;h to be found fault with, as you &s;ay, you &s;hall freely have it, (tho' not in a &s;plenetic or ill-natur'd way) as often as you give Occa&s;ion. Now, you mu&s;t know, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I have two Views in this: One is, to &s;ee how a Man of my Brother's Spirit, who has not deny'd him&s;elf any genteel Liberties, (for, it mu&s;t be own'd, he never was a common Town Rake, and had always Dignity in his Roguery) will behave him&s;elf to you, and in Wedlock, which u&s;ed to be very freely &s;neered by him: The next, that I may love you more and more, which it will be enough to make me do, I dare &s;ay, as by your Letters I &s;hall be more and more acquainted with you, as well as by Conver&s;ation; &s;o that you can't be off, if you would.</P>
<P>I know, however, you will have one Objection to this; and that is, that your Family Affairs will re|quire your Attention, and not give you the Time you u&s;ed to have for this Employment. But con&s;i|der, Child, the Station you are rai&s;ed to, does not require you to be quite a dome&s;tic Animal. You are lifted up to the Rank of a Lady, and you mu&s;t act up to it, and not think of &s;etting &s;uch an Example, as will derive upon you the Ill-will and Cen&s;ure of other Ladies.&mdash;For will any of our Sex vi&s;it one who is continually employing her&s;elf in &s;uch Works as either mu&s;t be a Reproach to her&s;elf, or to them?&mdash;You'll have nothing to do but to give Orders. You will con|&s;ider your&s;elf as the Task-mi&s;tre&s;s, and the common Herd of Female Servants as &s;o many Negroes direct|ing them&s;elves by your Nod; or your&s;elf as the Ma|&s;ter-wheel, in &s;ome beautiful Piece of Mechani&s;m, who&s;e dignify'd grave Motion is to &s;et a-going all the
<PB N="42" REF="47">
Under-wheels, with a Velocity &s;uitable to their re|&s;pective Parts.&mdash;Let your Servants, under your Di|rection, do all that relates to Hou&s;hold Oeconomy: They cannot write to entertain and in&s;truct as you can. So what will you have to do?&mdash;I'll an&s;wer my own Que&s;tion: In the fir&s;t Place, Endeavour to plea&s;e your Sovereign Lord and Ma&s;ter; and, let me tell you, any other Woman in <HI>England,</HI> be her Quality ever &s;o high, would have found enough to do to &s;ucceed in that. Secondly, To receive and pay Vi&s;its, in order, for his Credit as well as your own, to make your fa&s;hionable Neighbours fond of you. Then, thirdly, You will have Time upon your Hands (as your Monarch him&s;elf ri&s;es early, and is tolerably regular for &s;uch a Brazen-face as he has been) to write to me, in the manner I have men|tioned, and expect; and I &s;ee plainly, by your Style, that nothing can be ea&s;ier for you, than to do this.</P>
<P>And thus, and with Reading, may your Time be filled up with Reputation to your&s;elf, and Delight to others, till a fourth Employment puts it&s;elf upon you; and that is, (&s;hall I tell you in one Word, without mincing the Matter?) a Succe&s;&s;ion of brave Boys, to perpetuate a Family that has for many hundred Years been e&s;teemed worthy and eminent, and which, be|ing now reduced, in the direct Line, to him and me, <HI>expects</HI> it from you; or el&s;e, let me tell you, (nor will I balk it) my Brother, by de&s;cending to the whol&s;ome Cot &mdash; Excu&s;e me, <HI>Pamela,</HI>&mdash;will want one Apology for his Conduct, be as excellent as you may.</P>
<P>I &s;ay this, Child, not to reflect upon you, &s;ince the thing is done; for I love you dearly, and will love you more and more&mdash;but to let you know what is expected from you, and to encourage you in the Pro|&s;pect that is already opening to you both, and to me, who have the Welfare of the Family I &s;prung from
<PB N="43" REF="48">
&s;o much at Heart, altho' I know this will be attended with &s;ome Anxieties to a Mind &s;o thoughtful and ap|prehen&s;ive as yours &s;eems to be.</P>
<P>O but this puts me in mind of your Solicitude for fear the Gentlemen &s;hould have &s;een every thing con|tained in your Letters.&mdash;But this I will particularly &s;peak to in a third Letter, having fill'd my Paper on all Sides: And am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<P>AND &s;o, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you are very &s;olicitous to know if the Gentlemen have &s;een every Part of your Papers. I can't &s;ay but they have. Nor, ex|cept in regard to the Reputation of your &s;aucy Man, do I &s;ee why the Parts you hint at, might not be read by tho&s;e to whom the re&s;t might be &s;hewn.</P>
<P>I can tell you, Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> who is a very nice and delicate Lady, had no Objections to any Part, tho' read before Men: Only now and then, crying out&mdash; O the vile Man!&mdash;See, Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> what Wretches you Men are!&mdash;And, commi&s;erating you, Ah! the poor <HI>Pamela!</HI> &mdash; And expre&s;&s;ing her Impatience to hear on, how you e&s;cap'd at this time, and at that, and rejoicing in your E&s;cape.&mdash;And now-and-then, O Lady <HI>Davers!</HI> what a vile Brother you have!&mdash; I hate him perfectly. &mdash; The poor Girl cannot be made Amends for all this, tho' he has marry'd her. Who, that knows the&s;e Things of him, would wi&s;h him to be hers, with all his Advantages of Per&s;on,
<PB N="44" REF="49">
Mind and Fortune? &mdash; And &s;uch-like Expre&s;&s;ions in your Prai&s;e, and condemning him and his wicked Attempts.</P>
<P>But I can tell you this, that except one had heard every Tittle of your Danger; how near you were to Ruin, and how little he &s;tood upon taking any Mea|&s;ures to effect his vile Purpo&s;es, even daring to attempt you in the Pre&s;ence of a <HI>good</HI> Woman, which was a Wickedne&s;s that every <HI>wicked</HI> Man could not be guilty of;&mdash;I &s;ay, except one had known the&s;e things, one &s;hould not have been able to judge of the Merit of your Re&s;i&s;tance, and how &s;hocking tho&s;e Attempts were to your Virtue, in&s;omuch that Life it&s;elf was indanger'd by them: Nor, let me tell you, could I in particular, have &s;o well ju&s;tify'd him for marrying you (I mean with re&s;pect to his own proud and haughty Temper of Mind) if there had been Room to think he could have had you upon ea&s;ier Terms.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary, Child, on twenty Accounts, that we, your and his Well-wi&s;hers and Relations, &s;hould know that he had try'd every Stratagem, and made u&s;e of every Contrivance, to &s;ubdue you to his Purpo&s;e, before he marry'd you: And how would it have an&s;wer'd to his intrepid Character, and Pride of Heart, had we not been particularly let into the Nature of tho&s;e Attempts, which you &s;o nobly re|&s;i&s;ted, as to convince us all, that you have de&s;erv'd the good Fortune you have met with, as well as all the kind and re&s;pectful Treatment he can po&s;&s;ibly &s;hew you?</P>
<P>Nor ought you to be concern'd who &s;ees any the mo&s;t tender Parts of your Story, except, as I &s;aid, for <HI>his</HI> &s;ake; for it mu&s;t be a very unvirtuous Mind, that can form any other Ideas from what you relate, than tho&s;e of Terror and Pity for you. Your Ex|pre&s;&s;ions are too delicate to give the nice&s;t Ear Of|fence, except at him.&mdash;You paint no Scenes but &s;uch
<PB N="45" REF="50">
as make his Wickedne&s;s odious; and that Gentle|man, much more Lady, mu&s;t have a very corrupt Heart, who could, from &s;uch Circum&s;tances of Di|&s;tre&s;s, make any Reflections but what &s;hould be to your Honour, and in Abhorrence of &s;uch Actions. Indeed, Child, I am &s;o convinced of this, that by this Rule I would judge of any Man's Heart in the World, better than by a thou&s;and Declarations and Prote&s;tations. I do a&s;&s;ure you, raki&s;h as <HI>Jackey</HI> is, and freely as I doubt not that Lord <HI>Davers</HI> has formerly lived, (for he has been a Man of Plea&s;ure) they gave me, by their Behaviour on the&s;e tenderer Occa&s;ions, Rea&s;on to think they had more Virtue than not to be very apprehen&s;ive for your Safety; and my Lord &s;everal times exclaim'd, that he could not have thought his Brother &s;uch a Libertine neither.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Child, were not the&s;e things written in Confidence to your Mother? And bad as his Actions were to you, if you had not recited all you could re|cite, would there not have been Room for any one who &s;hould have &s;een what you writ, to imagine they had been &s;till wor&s;e? &mdash; And how could the Terror be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had &s;uch Effects upon you, as to indanger your Life, without imagining you had un|dergone the wor&s;t that a vile Man <HI>could</HI> offer, unle&s;s you had told us, what that was which he <HI>did</HI> offer, and &s;o put a Bound, as it were, to one's apprehen|&s;ive Imaginations of what you &s;uffered, which other|wi&s;e mu&s;t have been injurious to your Purity, tho' you could not help it?</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Pamela,</HI> it was but doing Ju&s;tice to the Libertine him&s;elf, to tell your Mother the whole Truth, that &s;he might know he was not &s;o very aban|doned, but that he could &s;top &s;hort of the Execu|tion of his wicked Purpo&s;es, which, he apprehended, if pur&s;u'd, would de&s;troy the Life, that, of all Lives, he would chu&s;e to pre&s;erve; and you ow'd al&s;o thus
<PB N="46" REF="51">
much to your Parents Peace of Mind, that after all their di&s;tracting Fears for you, they might &s;ee they had Rea&s;on to rejoice in an uncontaminated Daugh|ter. And one cannot but reflect, now all is over, and he has made you his Wife, that it mu&s;t be a Sa|tisfaction to the wicked Man, as well as to your&s;elf, that he was not more guilty than he <HI>was,</HI> and that he took no more Liberties than he <HI>did.</HI></P>
<P>For my own Part, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I could not have accounted for your Fits, by any De&s;cription &s;hort of tho&s;e you give; and had you been le&s;s parti|cular in the Circum&s;tances, I &s;hould have judg'd he had been &s;till <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> and your Per&s;on, tho' not your Mind, le&s;s pure, than his Pride would expect from the Woman he &s;hould marry: For this is the Ca&s;e of all Rakes, that tho' they indulge in all manner of Libertini&s;m them&s;elves, there is no Cla&s;s of Men who exact greater Delicacy than they, from the Per&s;ons they marry; tho' they care not how bad they make the Wives, the Si&s;ters, and Daughters of others.</P>
<P>I have run into Length again; &s;o will only add, (and &s;end all my three Letters together) that we all blame you in &s;ome degree for bearing the wicked <HI>Jewkes</HI> in your Sight, after the mo&s;t impudent A&s;|&s;i&s;tance &s;he gave to his lewd Attempt; much le&s;s, we think, ought you to have left her in her Place, and rewarded her for her Vilene&s;s, which could hardly be equalled by the wor&s;t Actions of the mo&s;t aban|doned Procure&s;s.</P>
<P>I know the Difficulties you lay under, in his arbi|trary Will, and in his Interce&s;&s;ion for her: But Lady <HI>Betty</HI> rightly ob&s;erves, that he knew what a vile Wo|man &s;he was, when he put you into her Power, and no doubt employ'd her, becau&s;e he was &s;ure &s;he would an&s;wer all his Purpo&s;es; and that therefore &s;he &s;hould have had very little Opinion of the Sincerity of his Reformation, while he was &s;o &s;olicitous in
<PB N="47" REF="52">
keeping her there, and in having her put on a foot, in the Pre&s;ent on your Nuptials, with hone&s;t <HI>Jervis.</HI></P>
<P>She would, &s;he &s;ays, had &s;he been in your Ca&s;e, have had one Struggle for her Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, let it have been taken as it would; and he that was &s;o well plea&s;ed with your Virtue, mu&s;t have thought this a natural Con&s;equence of it, if he was in earne&s;t to reclaim.</P>
<P>I know not whether you &s;hew him all I write, or not: But I have written this la&s;t Part in the Cover, as well for want of Room, as that you may keep it from him, if you plea&s;e. Tho', if you think it will &s;erve any good End, I am not again&s;t &s;hewing to him all I write. For I mu&s;t ever &s;peak my Mind, tho' I were to &s;mart for it; and that nobody can, or has the Heart to make me do, but my bold Brother. So, <HI>Pamela,</HI> for this time,</P>

<P>The other Particulars contained in your Lady&s;hip's kind Letters will naturally fall under one or other of the&s;e three Heads.&mdash; But expect not, my Lady, tho' I begin in Method thus, that I &s;hall keep up to it; If your Lady&s;hip will not allow for me, and keep in View the poor <HI>Pamela Andrews</HI> in all I write, but will have Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> in your Eye, what will be|come of me? &mdash; But, indeed, I promi&s;e my&s;elf &s;o much Improvement from this Corre&s;pondence, that I enter upon it with a greater Delight than I can ex|pre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the mingled Awe and Diffi|dence that will accompany me, in every Part of the agreeable Task.</P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t Article;</P>
<P>Your dear Brother, and my hone&s;t Parents &mdash; (I know your Lady&s;hip will expect from me, that on
<PB N="49" REF="54">
all Occa&s;ions I &s;hould &s;peak of them with the Duty that becomes a good Child) &mdash; I &s;ay, then, your dear Brother, and they, and my&s;elf, &s;et out on the <HI>Monday</HI> Morning for <HI>Kent,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>St. Albans</HI> to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> at both which Places we &s;topp'd a Night; for our dear Benefactor would make us take ea&s;y Journeys; and on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Evening we arrived at the &s;weet Place allotted for the good Couple. We were at|tended only by <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> on Hor&s;eback; for Mr. <HI>Colbrand,</HI> having &s;prain'd his Foot, was in the Travelling-Coach with the Cook and Hou&s;e-Maid, and <HI>Polly Barlow,</HI> a genteel new Servant, whom Mrs. <HI>Brooks</HI> recommended to wait on me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> had been down there for a Fortnight, imploy'd in &s;ettling the Terms of an additional Pur|chace to this pretty well-wooded and well-watered E&s;tate; and the Account he gave of his Proceedings was very &s;atisfactory to his honour'd Principal. He told us, he had much ado to di&s;&s;uade the Tenants from pur&s;uing a form'd Re&s;olution of meeting their Landlord on Hor&s;eback, at &s;ome Miles Di&s;tance; for he had inform'd them when he expected us: But knowing how de&s;irous Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was of being retired while he &s;taid here this time, he had ventured to a&s;&s;ure them, that when every thing was &s;ettled, and the new Purchace actually enter'd upon, they would have his Pre&s;ence among them now-and-then; and that he would introduce them all at different times to their worthy Landlord, before we left the Country.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e, my good Lady, is large and very commodious; and we found every thing about it, and in it, exceeding neat and convenient; which was owing to the worthy Mr. <HI>Longman</HI>'s Care and Di|rection. The Ground is well-&s;tock'd, the Barns and Out-hou&s;es in excellent Repair, and my poor Father and Mother have only to wi&s;h, that they and
<PB N="50" REF="55">
I may be de&s;erving of half the Goodne&s;s we experi|ence from the bountiful Mind of your good Brother.</P>
<P>But indeed, my Lady, I have the Plea&s;ure of dis|covering every Day more and more, that there is not a better di&s;pos'd and more generous Gentleman in the World than him&s;elf, in&s;omuch that, I verily think, he has not been &s;o careful to conceal his <HI>bad</HI> Actions as his <HI>good</HI> ones. His Heart is naturally bene|ficent, and his Beneficence is the Gift of God to him, as I have been &s;o free as to tell him, to &s;erve for excellent Purpo&s;es, even for a Foundation to the noble&s;t Super&s;tructure, whenever the Rubbi&s;h of Sen&s;e &s;hall be clear'd from it, and the Divine Workmen be properly employ'd to build a Temple for the Deity to re&s;ide in. &mdash; Pardon me, my dear Lady; I wi&s;h I may not be impertinently grave: But I find a great many In&s;tances of his con&s;iderate Cha|rity, which hardly any body knew of, and which, &s;ince I have been his Almoner, could not avoid coming to my Knowlege. &mdash; But this, po&s;&s;ibly, is no News to your Lady&s;hip. Every body knows the generous Goodne&s;s of your own Heart: Every one that wanted Relief ta&s;ted the Bounty of your excel|lent Mother, my late honour'd Lady: So that 'tis a <HI>Family Grace,</HI> and I have no need to &s;peak of it to you, Madam.</P>
<P>This cannot, my dear Lady, I hope, be con&s;trued as if I would hereby &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves le&s;s oblig'd. Indeed I know nothing &s;o God-like in Human Na|ture as this Di&s;po&s;ition to do Good to our Fellow-Creatures; for is it not following immediately the Example of that gracious Providence which every Minute is conferring Ble&s;&s;ings on us all, and by giv|ing Power to the Rich, makes them but the Di&s;pen|&s;ers of its Benefits to tho&s;e that want them? But yet, as there are but too many Objects of Compa&s;&s;ion, and as the mo&s;t beneficent Mind in the World can|not,
<PB N="51" REF="56">
like Omnipotence, do Good to all, how much are they oblig'd who are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others? And this, kept in Mind, will always contribute to make the Benefited receive as they ought the Favours of the Obliger.</P>
<P>I know not if I write to be under&s;tood in all I mean; but my grateful Heart is &s;o over-fill'd when it is imploy'd on this Subject, that methinks I want to &s;ay a great deal more, at the &s;ame time that I am apprehen&s;ive I &s;ay too much. &mdash; Yet, perhaps, the Copies of the Letters I here inclo&s;e to your Lady|&s;hip, (that mark'd [I.] written by me to my Father and Mother, on our Return hither from <HI>Kent</HI>; that mark'd [II.] from my dear Father in An&s;wer to it, and that mark'd [III.] mine in Reply to his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letters <HI>1, 2, 3,</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>) will, (at the &s;ame time that they may convince your Lady&s;hip, that I will conceal nothing from you, in the Cour&s;e of this Corre&s;pondence, that may in the lea&s;t amu&s;e and divert you, or that may better explain our grateful Sentiments) in a great mea&s;ure, an&s;wer what your Lady&s;hip expects from me, as to the happy Fort|night we pa&s;s'd in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>And here I will conclude this Letter, chu&s;ing to &s;u&s;pend the Corre&s;pondence, till I know from your Lady&s;hip, whether it will not be too low, too idle for your Attention; whether you will not di&s;pen&s;e with your own Commands for my writing to you, when you &s;ee it is &s;o little likely to an&s;wer what you may po&s;&s;ibly expect from me; or whether, if you in&s;i&s;t upon my &s;cribbling, you would have me write in any other Way, be le&s;s tedious, le&s;s &s;erious&mdash; in &s;hort, le&s;s or more any thing.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear</HI> Pamela,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU very much oblige me by your chearful Compliance with my Reque&s;t. I leave it in|tirely to you to write in what Manner you plea&s;e, and as you &s;hall be in the Humour to write, when you take up your Pen; for then I &s;hall have you write with le&s;s Re&s;traint: For, you mu&s;t know, that what we admire in you, are Truth and Nature, and not &s;tudied or elaborate Sentiments. We can hear at Church, or we can read in our Clo&s;ets, fifty good Things that we expect not from you; but we cannot receive from any body el&s;e the Plea&s;ure of Sentiments flowing with that artle&s;s Ea&s;e, which &s;o much affects us when we read your Letters. Then, my &s;weet Girl, your Gratitude, your Prudence, your Integrity of Heart, your Humility, &s;hine &s;o much in all your Letters and Sentiments, that no Wonder my Brother loves you as he does: But I &s;hall make you proud, I doubt, and &s;o by Prai&s;e ruin tho&s;e Graces which we admire, and, but for that, cannot prai&s;e too much. &mdash; In my Con&s;cience, if thou can&s;t hold as thou ha&s;t begun, I believe thou wilt have him <HI>all to thy&s;elf,</HI> and that was once, more than I thought ever any Wo|man
<PB N="53" REF="58">
on this Side the Seventieth Year of his Age would ever be able to &s;ay. The Letters to and from your Parents we are charm'd with, and the communicating of them to me, I take to be as great an In&s;tance of your Confidence in me, as it is of your Judgment and Prudence; for you cannot but think, that we his Relations are a little watchful over your Conduct, and have our Eyes upon you, to ob|&s;erve what U&s;e you are likely to make of the Power you have over your Man, with re&s;pect to your own Relations.</P>
<P>Hitherto all is unexampled Prudence, and you take the right Method to reconcile even the proude&s;t of us to your Marriage, and make us not only love you, but re&s;pect your Parents, becau&s;e their Hone&s;ty will, I perceive, be their di&s;tingui&s;hing Character, and they will not forget them&s;elves, nor their former Condition.</P>
<P>I can tell you, you are exactly right; for if you were to be an <HI>Incroacher,</HI> as the good old Man calls it, my Brother would be one of the fir&s;t to &s;ee it, and he would gradually think le&s;s and le&s;s of you, till po&s;&s;ibly he might come to de&s;pi&s;e you, and to repent of his Choice: For the lea&s;t Shadow of an Impo|&s;ition, or low Cunning, or mean Selfi&s;hne&s;s, he can|not bear.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, you're a charming Girl; and Lady <HI>Betty</HI> &s;ays &s;o too; and, moreover, adds, That if he makes you not the be&s;t and <HI>faithfulle&s;t</HI> of Husbands, he cannot de&s;erve you, for all his Fortune and Birth. &mdash; And, in my Heart, I begin to think &s;o too.</P>
<P>But won't you oblige me with the Sequel of your Letter to your Father? for you promi&s;e, my dear charming Scribbler, in that you &s;ent to me, to write again to his Letter; and I long to &s;ee how you an&s;wer the latter Part of it, about your Relations de&s;iring already to come and live with him. I know what I
<PB N="54" REF="59">
<HI>expect</HI> from you. But, let it be what it will, &s;end it to me, exactly as you wrote it; and I &s;hall &s;ee whether I have Rea&s;on to prai&s;e or to reprove you. For &s;urely, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you mu&s;t leave one Room to blame you for &s;omething. Indeed I can hardly bear the Thought, that you &s;hould &s;o much excel as you do, and have more Prudence by Intuition, as it were, than the be&s;t of us have in a Series of the gen|teele&s;t Education, and with fifty Advantages at lea&s;t in Conver&s;ation that <HI>you</HI> could not have, by rea&s;on of my Mother's retired Life, while you were with her, and your clo&s;e Attendance on her Per&s;on.</P>
<P>But I'll tell you what has been a great Improve|ment to you: It is your own Writings. This Itch of Scribbling has been a charming Help to you. For here, having a natural Fund of good Sen&s;e, and a Prudence above your Years, you have, with the Ob&s;ervations tho&s;e Advantages have inabled you to make, been Flint and Steel too, as I may &s;ay, to your|&s;elf: So that you have &s;truck <HI>Fire</HI> when you pleas'd, wanting nothing but a few dry'd Leaves, like the fir&s;t Pair in old <HI>Du Bartas,</HI> to &s;erve as Tinder to catch your animating Sparks. So that reading con|&s;tantly, and thus u&s;ing your&s;elf to write, which im|pre&s;s'd you more than Reading could, and enjoying be&s;ides the Benefit of a good Memory, every thing you heard or read became your own; and not only &s;o, but improved by pa&s;&s;ing thro' more &s;alubrious Ducts and Vehicles; like &s;ome fine Fruit grafted upon a common Free-&s;tock, who&s;e more exuberant Juices &s;erve to bring to quicker and greater Perfection the downy Peach, or the &s;mooth Nectarine with its crim&s;on Blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Really, <HI>Pamela,</HI> I believe I, too, &s;hall improve by writing to you. &mdash; Why, you dear Saucy-face, at this Rate, you'll make every one that conver&s;es with you, better, and wi&s;er, and <HI>wittier</HI> too, as far as I
<PB N="55" REF="60">
know, than they ever before thought there was <HI>Room</HI> for 'em to be.</P>
<P>As to my own Part, I begin to like what I have written my&s;elf, I think; and your Corre&s;pondence will po&s;&s;ibly make me re&s;ume the poetical Ideas that u&s;ed to be &s;trong upon me, before I entered into the drow&s;y married Life; for my good Lord <HI>Davers</HI>'s Turn happens not to be to Books; and &s;o, by De|grees, my Imagination was in a manner quench'd, and I, as a dutiful Wife &s;hould, endeavour'd to form my Ta&s;te by that of the Man I cho&s;e.</P>
<P>But after all, <HI>Pamela,</HI> you are not to be a little proud (I can tell you that) of my Corre&s;pondence; and I could not have thought it e'er would have come to this: But you'll have the Penetration to ob&s;erve, that I am the more free and unre&s;erved, to encourage <HI>you</HI> to write without Re&s;traint: For already you have made us a Family of Writers and Readers; &s;o that Lord <HI>Davers</HI> him&s;elf is become inamour'd of your Letters, and de&s;ires of all things he may hear read every one that pa&s;&s;es between us. Nay, <HI>Jackey,</HI> for that matter, who was the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s, whi&s;tling, &s;auntering Fellow you ever knew, and who&s;e Delight in a Book ran no higher than a Song or a Catch, now comes in with an inquiring Face, and vows he'll &s;et Pen to Paper, and turn Letter-writer him&s;elf; and intends (if my Brother won't take it ami&s;s, he &s;ays) to begin to <HI>you,</HI> provided he could be &s;ure of an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>I have twenty Things &s;till to &s;ay; for you have un|locked all our Bo&s;oms: And yet I intended not to write above ten or a dozen Lines when I began; only to tell you, that I would have you take your own Way, in your Subjects, and in your Style. &mdash; And if you will but give me Hope, that you are in the Way I &s;o much wi&s;h to have you in, I will then call my&s;elf

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear good Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT kind, what generous things, are you plea|&s;ed to &s;ay of your happy Corre&s;pondent! And what Rea&s;on have I to value my&s;elf on &s;uch an Advan|tage as is now before me, if I am capable of improving it as I ought, from a Corre&s;pondence with &s;o noble and &s;o admired a Lady! I wi&s;h I be not now proud indeed! &mdash; To be prai&s;ed by &s;uch a Genius, and by the noble Si&s;ter of my honoured Benefactor, who&s;e Favour, next to his own, it was always my chief Ambition to obtain, is what would be enough to fill with Vanity a &s;teadier and a more equal Mind than mine.</P>
<P>I have heard from my late honoured Lady, what a fine Pen her beloved Daughter was Mi&s;tre&s;s of, when &s;he plea&s;ed to take it up: But I never could have had the Pre&s;umption, but from your Lady&s;hip's own Motion, to hope to be in any manner the Sub|ject of it, much le&s;s to be called your Corre&s;pon|dent.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, I <HI>am</HI> proud, <HI>very</HI> proud of this Honour, and con&s;ider it as &s;uch a Heightening to my Plea&s;ures, as only <HI>that</HI> could give; and I will &s;et about obeying your Lady&s;hip without Re&s;erve.</P>
<P>But permit me, in the fir&s;t Place, to di&s;claim any Merit, from my own poor Writings, to that Improve|ment
<PB N="57" REF="62">
which your Goodne&s;s imputes to me. What I have to boa&s;t of that Sort, is owing principally, if it de&s;erves Commendation, to my late excellent Lady. It is hardly to be imagined what Pains her Lady&s;hip took with her poor Servant. Be&s;ides make|ing me keep a Book of her Charities di&s;pen&s;ed by my Hands, &s;he cau&s;ed me always to &s;et down, in my Way, the Ca&s;es of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, their Griefs from their Misfortunes, and their Joys in her bountiful Re|lief; and &s;o I was enter'd early into the various Turns that affected worthy Hearts, and was taught the better to regulate my own, e&s;pecially by the Help of the fine Ob&s;ervations which my good Lady u&s;ed to make to me, when I read to her what I wrote. For many a time has her worthy Heart run over with Plea|&s;ure at my Remarks, and with Prai&s;es; and I was her good Girl, her dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> her hopeful Maiden; and &s;he would &s;ometimes &s;natch my Hand with Tran&s;port, and draw me to her, and vouch&s;afe to ki&s;s me; and always was &s;aying, what &s;he would do for me, if God &s;pared her, and I continued to be de&s;erving.</P>
<P>O my dear Lady! you cannot think what an En|couragement this conde&s;cending Behaviour and Goodne&s;s was to me. Indeed, Madam, you <HI>cannot</HI> think it.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed to throw my&s;elf at her Feet, and embrace her Knees; and, my Eyes &s;treaming with Tears of Joy, would often cry, O continue to me, my deare&s;t Lady, the Ble&s;&s;ing of your Favour and kind In&s;tru|ctions, and it is all your happy, happy <HI>Pamela</HI> can wi&s;h for!</P>
<P>But I will proceed to obey your Lady&s;hip, and write with as much Freedom as I po&s;&s;ibly <HI>can:</HI> For you mu&s;t not expect, that I can be intirely dive&s;ted of that Awe, which will lay me under more Re&s;traint, than if I was writing to my Father and Mother,
<PB N="58" REF="63">
who&s;e Partiality for their Daughter made me in a manner &s;ecure of their good Opinions.</P>
<P>And now, that I may &s;horten the Work before me, in the Account I am to give of the &s;weet Fort|night that we pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Kent,</HI> I inclo&s;e not only the Copy of the Letter your Lady&s;hip de&s;ired me to &s;end you, but my Father's An&s;wer to it, which, with tho&s;e you have already, will &s;et before your Lady&s;hip all you want to &s;ee in relation to the De&s;ire &s;ome of my Kindred had to live with my Father, and my own Advice on the Occa&s;ion. And I am humbly confident you will join in Sentiment with me: For Per&s;ons are le&s;s doubtful of Approbation, when their Minds are incapable of dark Re&s;erves, or &s;uch Views as they would be afraid &s;hould be detected by the mo&s;t watchful Ob&s;erver of their Conduct: And your Lady&s;hip gives me double Plea&s;ure, that you are plea&s;ed to have an Eye upon mine; fir&s;t, Becau&s;e I hope it will be &s;uch as will, generally, bear the &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny; and next, Becau&s;e, when my Actions fall &s;hort of my Intentions, I pre&s;ume to hope your Lady&s;hip will be as kind a Monitor to me, as you are a Corre&s;pondent; and then I &s;hall have an Opportu|nity to correct my&s;elf, and be, as near as my &s;lender Talents will permit, what your Lady&s;hip would have me to be.</P>
<P>As the Letters I &s;ent before, and tho&s;e I now &s;end, will let your Lady&s;hip into &s;everal Particulars, &s;uch as a brief De&s;cription of the Hou&s;e and Farm, and your honoured Brother's Intentions of retiring thither now-and-then; of the Happine&s;s and Gratitude of my dear Parents, and their Wi&s;hes to be able to de|&s;erve the Comforts his Goodne&s;s has heaped upon them; and that in &s;tronger Lights than I am able to &s;et them; I will only, in a &s;ummary manner, men|tion the re&s;t: And, particularly,</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="64">That the Behaviour of my dear Benefactor to me, to my Parents, to Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and to the Tenants, was one continued Series of Benignity and Conde|&s;cen&s;ion. He endeavoured, in every kind and gene|rous way, to encourage the good Couple to be free and chearful with him; and &s;eeing them unable to get over that Awe and Re&s;pect which they owe him above all Mankind, and which they &s;ought to pay him on all Occa&s;ions, he would take their Hands, and move than once called them by the neare&s;t and deare&s;t Names of Relation&s;hip, as if they were his own Parents; and I believe would have di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd them oftener in this manner, but that he &s;aw them too much affected with his Goodne&s;s to bear the Honour (as my dear Father &s;ays in his fir&s;t Let|ter) with <HI>Equalne&s;s of Temper</HI>; and he &s;eemed al|ways to delight in being particularly kind to them before Strangers, and before the Tenants, and before Mr. <HI>Sorby,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Shepherd,</HI> three of the principal Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood, who, with their Ladies, came to vi&s;it us, and who&s;e Vi&s;its we <HI>all</HI> returned; for your dear Brother would not permit my Father and Mother to decline the In|vitation of tho&s;e worthy Families.</P>
<P>Judge you, my dear Lady, with what a Joy the&s;e kind Di&s;tinctions, and this &s;weet Behaviour, mu&s;t fill their hone&s;t Hearts: Judge of my grateful Sentiments and Acknowlegements on the&s;e hourly In&s;tances of his Goodne&s;s; and judge of the Re&s;pect and E&s;teem with which this mu&s;t in&s;pire every one to the good Couple. And when once Mrs. <HI>Bennet</HI> had like to have &s;aid &s;omething of their former Condition, which &s;he would have recalled in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, and when &s;he could not, apologized for it, the dear Gentleman &s;aid, &mdash; All is well, Mrs. <HI>Bennet:</HI> No Apologies are nece&s;&s;ary; and to &s;hew you they are not, I'll tell you my&s;elf what you cannot have heard
<PB N="60" REF="65">
&s;o particularly from others, and which were I to en|deavour to conceal, would be a Piece of Pride as &s;tupid as de&s;picable: So, in a conci&s;e manner, he gave them an Account of my Story, &s;o much to my Advantage, and &s;o little to his own, in the ingenuous Relation of his Attempts upon me, that you can't imagine, Madam, how much the Gentry were af|fected by it, and how much, in particular, they ap|plauded him for the Genero&s;ity of his Actions to me and to my dear Parents. And your Lady&s;hip will permit me to ob&s;erve, that &s;ince the Matter is cir|cum&s;tanced as it is, Policy, as well as Noblene&s;s of Mind, obliged from the dear Gentleman this Frank|ne&s;s and Acknowlegement; for having &s;aid <HI>wor&s;e</HI> of him&s;elf, and as mean of our Fortunes, as they could think, what remained for the Hearers but to <HI>applaud,</HI> when he had left them no Room to <HI>reproach,</HI> not &s;o much as in Thought?</P>
<P>Every Day we rode out, or walked a little about the Grounds; and while we were there, he employ'd Hands to cut a Vi&s;ta thro' a Coppice, as they call it, but rather a little Wood, to a ri&s;ing Ground, which fronting an old-fa&s;hion'd Balcony in the Middle of the Hou&s;e, he ordered it to be planted like a Grove, and a little Building to be erected on its Summit, in the Fa&s;hion of an antient <HI>Greek</HI> Temple, of which he has &s;ent them a Draught, drawn by his own Hand, from one he had &s;een Abroad; and this, and a few other Alterations mentioned in my Letter to my Father, are to be fini&s;hed again&s;t we go down next.</P>
<P>The dear Gentleman was every Hour pre&s;&s;ing me, while there, to take one Diver&s;ion or other, frequently upbraiding me, that I &s;eemed not to chu&s;e any thing; urging me to propo&s;e &s;ometimes what I could <HI>wi&s;h</HI> he &s;hould oblige me in, and not always to leave it to him to chu&s;e for me; &s;aying he was half-afraid, that my

<P>Thus far, my dear Lady, the Relation I gave to my Parents, at the Time of my being fir&s;t acquainted with this melancholy Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="68">It is a great Plea&s;ure to me, that I can already flat|ter my&s;elf, from the Hints you kindly give me, that I behaved as you wi&s;hed I &s;hould behave. Indeed, Madam, I could not help it; for I pitied mo&s;t &s;in|cerely the unhappy Lady; and tho' I could not but rejoice, that I had had the Grace to e&s;cape the dan|gerous Attempts of the dear Intriguer, yet never did the Story of any unfortunate Lady make &s;uch an Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon me as hers did: She loved <HI>him,</HI> and believed, no doubt, he loved <HI>her</HI> too well to take ungenerous Advantages of her &s;oft Pa&s;&s;ion for him; and &s;o, by Degrees, put her&s;elf in his Power; and too &s;eldom, alas! have the noble&s;t-minded of the &s;educe|ing Sex the Mercy or the Goodne&s;s to &s;pare the poor Creatures that do!&mdash;And then this Love, to be &s;ure, is a &s;ad Thing, when once it is &s;uffer'd to reign!&mdash; A perfect Tyrant!&mdash;requiring an unconditional Obe|dience to its arbitrary Dictates, and deeming every In&s;tance of Di&s;cretion, and Prudence, and Virtue it|&s;elf, too often, but as &s;o many Acts of Rebellion to its u&s;urped Authority.</P>
<P>And then, how do even Blemi&s;hes become Per|fections in tho&s;e we love? Crimes them&s;elves too often, to incon&s;iderate Minds, appear but as human Failings; and human Failings are a <HI>common Cau&s;e,</HI> and always pardonable by human Frailty.</P>
<P>Then 'tis another Misfortune of People in Love, they always think highly of the beloved Object, and lowly of them&s;elves; &s;uch a di&s;mal Mortifier is Love!</P>
<P>I &s;ay not this, Madam, to excu&s;e the poor Lady's Fall: Nothing can do that; becau&s;e Virtue is, and ought to be, preferable to all Con&s;iderations, and to Life it&s;elf. But methinks I love this dear Lady &s;o well, for the &s;ake of her edifying Penitence, that I would fain extenuate her Crime, if I could; and the rather, as, in all Probability, it was a <HI>fir&s;t Love</HI> on <HI>both</HI>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My good Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Now come to your Lady&s;hip's Remarks on my Conduct to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>; which you are plea&s;ed to think too kind and forgiving, con&s;idering the poor Woman's Ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That I ought not to have borne her in my Sight, after the impudent A&s;|&s;i&s;tance &s;he gave to his lewd Attempts; much le&s;s to have left her in her Place, and rewarded her for her Vilene&s;s."</Q>
Alas! my dear Lady, what could I do; a poor Pri&s;oner, as I was made, for Weeks together, in Breach of all the Laws of Civil Society; not a Soul who dur&s;t be my Friend; and
<PB N="65" REF="70">
every Day expecting to be ruin'd and undone, by one of the haughtie&s;t and mo&s;t determin'd Spirits in <HI>England?</HI> &mdash; And when it plea&s;ed GOD to turn his Heart, and incline him to abandon his wicked Attempts, and to profe&s;s honourable Love to me, his poor Servant, can it be thought I was to in&s;i&s;t upon Conditions with &s;uch a Gentleman, who had me in his Power; and who, if I had provoked him, might have re&s;umed all his wicked Purpo&s;es again&s;t me?</P>
<P>Indeed, I was too much overjoy'd, after all my Dangers pa&s;t, (which were &s;o great, that I could not go to Re&s;t, nor ri&s;e, but with &s;uch Apprehen|&s;ions, that I wi&s;h'd for Death rather than Life) to think of refu&s;ing any Terms that I could yield to, and keep my Honour.</P>
<P>And tho' &s;uch noble Ladies, as your Lady&s;hip and Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> who are born to Independency, and are hereditarily, as I may &s;ay, on a Foot with the highe&s;t-de&s;cended Gentleman in the Land, might have exerted Spirit, and would have had a Right to pick and chu&s;e your own Servants, and di&s;tribute Rewards and Puni&s;hments to the De&s;erv|ing and Unde&s;erving, at your own good Plea&s;ure; yet what had I, a poor Girl, who ow'd my Title even to common Notice, to the Bounty of my late good Lady, and a kind of imputed Sightline&s;s of Per&s;on, which had made me only the Subject of vile Attempts; who from a Situation of Terror and Ap|prehen&s;ion was lifted up to a Hope, beyond my highe&s;t Ambition, and was bid to pardon the bad Woman, as an In&s;tance, that I could forgive his own hard U&s;age of me; who had experienced &s;o often the Violence and Impetuo&s;ity of his Temper, which even his beloved Mother never re&s;i&s;ted till it &s;ub|&s;ided; and then indeed he was all Goodne&s;s and Acknowlegement, (of which I could give your La|dy&s;hip
<PB N="66" REF="71">
more than one In&s;tance) what, I &s;ay, had I to do, to take upon me Lady-Airs, and re&s;ent?</P>
<P>But, my dear Ladies, (let me, in this In&s;tance, be&s;peak both your Lady&s;hips Attention) I &s;hould be inexcu&s;able, if I did not tell you all the Truth; and that is, that I not only forgave the poor Wretch, in regard to <HI>his Commands,</HI> but from <HI>my own In|clination.</HI></P>
<P>If I am wrong in &s;aying this, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to your Lady&s;hips; and, as I pretend not to Perfection, am ready to take the Blame I &s;hall be found to de&s;erve in your Lady&s;hips Judgment; but indeed, were it to do again, I verily think, I could not help forgiving her. And were I not able to &s;ay this, I &s;hould be thought to have made a mean Court to my Ma&s;ter's Pa&s;&s;ions, and to have done a wrong thing with my Eyes open&punc; Which, I humbly conceive, no one &s;hould do.</P>
<P>When this poor Creature was put into my Power, (&s;eemingly at lea&s;t, tho' it might po&s;&s;ibly have been re&s;um'd, and I might have been re-committed to hers, had I given him Rea&s;on to think I made an arrogant U&s;e of it) you cannot imagine what a Triumph I had in my Mind on the mortify'd Guilt, which (from the highe&s;t Degree of In&s;olence and Imperiou&s;ne&s;s, that before harden'd her ma&s;culine Features) appear'd in her Countenance, when &s;he found the Tables likely to be &s;oon turn'd upon her.</P>
<P>This Change of Behaviour, which at fir&s;t operated in &s;ullen Awe, and afterwards in a kind of &s;ilent Re&s;pect, &s;hew'd me, what an Influence Power had over her; and that when &s;he could treat her late Pri&s;oner, when taken into Favour, &s;o ob&s;equiou&s;ly, it was the le&s;s Wonder the bad Woman could think it her Duty to obey Commands &s;o unju&s;t, when her Obedience to them was required from her Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, if a Look could have killed her, after &s;ome of her bad Treatment, &s;he had been &s;lain over
<PB N="67" REF="72">
and over, as I may &s;ay: But to me, who always was taught to di&s;tingui&s;h between the Per&s;on and the Action, I could not hold my Re&s;entment again&s;t the poor pa&s;&s;ive Machine of Mi&s;chief, one Day to|gether, tho' her Actions were &s;o odious to me.</P>
<P>I &s;hould indeed except that Time of my grand Trial, when &s;he appear'd &s;o much a Wretch to me, that I &s;aw her not (even after <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I <HI>p.</HI> 275.</NOTE> two Days that &s;he was kept from my Sight) without great Flutter and Emotion of Heart; and I had repre&s;ented to your Brother before, how hard a Condition it was for me to forgive &s;o much unwomanly Wicked|ne&s;s.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 277.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, my dear Ladies, when I con&s;ider'd the Mat|ter in <HI>one</HI> particular Light, I could the more ea&s;ily forgive her; and <HI>having</HI> forgiven her, <HI>bear her in my Sight,</HI> and act by her (as a Con&s;equence of that Forgivene&s;s) as if &s;he had not &s;o horridly offended.&mdash; El&s;e, how would it have been Forgivene&s;s? E&s;pe|cially as &s;he was a&s;hamed of her Crime, and there was no Fear of a Repetition of it.</P>
<P>Thus then I thought on the Occa&s;ion: Poor wretched Agent, for Purpo&s;es little le&s;s than infer|nal! I <HI>will</HI> forgive thee, &s;ince <HI>thy</HI> Ma&s;ter and <HI>my</HI> Ma&s;ter will have it &s;o. And indeed thou art beneath the Re&s;entment even of &s;uch a poor Girl as I. I will <HI>pity</HI> thee, ba&s;e and abject, as thou art. And &s;he who is the Object of my <HI>Pity,</HI> is &s;urely beneath my <HI>Anger.</HI> My Eye, that u&s;ed to quiver and trem|ble at thy haughty Eye, &s;hall now, with con&s;cious Worthine&s;s, take a &s;uperior Steadine&s;s, and look down thy &s;couling guilty one into Self-Condemna|tion, the State thou could&s;t never ca&s;t mine into, nor from it wilt be able to rai&s;e thine own! Bear the Reproach of thy own wicked Heart, low, vile
<PB N="68" REF="73">
Woman, unworthy as thou art of the <HI>Name,</HI> and cho&s;en, as it &s;hould &s;eem, for a Foil to the Inno|cent, and to make Purity &s;hine forth the brighter, the <HI>only</HI> good U&s;e &s;uch Wretches as thou can be of to others (except for Examples of Penitence and Mercy): This will be Puni&s;hment enough for thee, without my expo&s;ing my&s;elf to the Imputation of de&s;cending &s;o near to a Level with thee, as to re|&s;ent thy Ba&s;ene&s;s, when thou ha&s;t no Power to hurt me!&mdash;</P>
<P>Such were then my Thoughts, my proud Thoughts, &s;o far was I in my Heart, and, I hoped, in the very Act that proceeded from that Heart, from <HI>inten|tional</HI> Meanne&s;s in forgiving, at Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Interpo|&s;ition, the poor, low, creeping, abject, <HI>Self</HI>-morti|fy'd, and <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>-mortify'd Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>!&mdash;</P>
<P>And do you think, Ladies, when you revolve in your Thoughts, <HI>who</HI> I was, and <HI>what</HI> I was, and what I was de&s;igned to be; when you revolve the amazing Turn in my Favour, and the Pro&s;pects before me (Pro&s;pect &s;o much above my Hope, that I left them intirely to Providence to direct for me, as it plea&s;ed, without daring to look forward to what tho&s;e Pro&s;pect &s;eemed naturally to tend); when I could &s;ee my haughty Per&s;ecutor become my repentant Protector; the lofty Spirit that u&s;ed to make me tremble, and to which I never could look up without Awe, except in tho&s;e animating Ca&s;es, where his Guilt, and my Innocence, gave me a Courage, more than natural to my other|wi&s;e da&s;tardly Heart: When this impetuous Spirit could &s;toop to reque&s;t one whom he had &s;unk beneath even her u&s;ual low Character of his Servant, and was his Pri&s;oner, under Sentence of a Ruin wor&s;e than Death, as he had intended it, and had &s;eized her for that very Purpo&s;e, could &s;toop to acknow|ledge the Vilene&s;s of tho&s;e Purpo&s;es: Could &s;ay,
<PB N="69" REF="74">
at one time,

At another, acknowlege before her,

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We have been both Sinners, and mu&s;t be both included in one Act of Grace:"</Q></P>
<P>When I &s;ay, I was thus lifted up to the State of a &s;overeign Forgiver, and my lordly Ma&s;ter became a Petitioner for him&s;elf, and for the guilty Creature, whom he put under my Feet; what a Triumph was here for the poor <HI>Pamela</HI>! And could I have been guilty of &s;o mean a Pride, as to trample upon the poor abject Creature, when I found her thus lowly, thus mortify'd, and &s;o much in my Power? For &s;o &s;he actually was, while I &s;eemed to think &s;o: And would it have been good Manners with regard to my Ma&s;ter, or Policy with re&s;pect to may&s;elf, to doubt it, after he had &s;o declared? &mdash;</P>
<P>Then, my dear Ladies, while I was injoying the Soul-charming Fruits of that Innocence which the Divine Grace had inabled me to pre&s;erve, in &s;pite of &s;o many Plots and Contrivances on my <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>'s Side, and &s;uch wicked In&s;tigations, and A&s;&s;i&s;tances on hers, and all my Pro&s;pects were improving upon me beyond my Wi&s;hes; when all was Sun&s;hine, unclouded Sun&s;hine, and I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my Mind in
<PB N="70" REF="75">
Peace, and had nothing to do but to be thankful to Providence, which had been &s;o gracious to my Unworthine&s;s; when I &s;aw, as I &s;aid above, my Per&s;ecutor become my Protector, my active Ene|my, no longer my Enemy, but creeping, with flow, doubtful Feet, and &s;peaking to me, with awful he&s;i|tating Doubt of my Acceptation; a Stamp of an in&s;olent Foot, turned into court'fying half-bent Knees; threatening Hands into &s;upplicating Folds; and the Eye unpitying to Innocence, running over with the Sen&s;e of her own Guilt, a faltering Ac|cent on her late menacing Tongue, and uplifted Handkerchief,&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;ee &s;he will be my Lady: And then I know how it will go with me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 285.</NOTE>;"</Q>
&mdash;Was not this, my Ladies, a Triumph of Triumphs to the late mi&s;erable, now exalted <HI>Pamela?</HI>&mdash;Could I do le&s;s than pardon her? And having declared, that I did &s;o, was I not to &s;hew the Sincerity of my Declaration?</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, my dear good Ladies, I found &s;uch a Subject for Exultation in this providential Change of my Condition, that I had much ado to &s;ubdue my ri&s;ing Pride, and thought there was more Danger of being lifted up, (every Moment, to &s;ee &s;uch improving Contrition on the poor Creature's Part) than to be &s;uppo&s;ed guilty of a Meanne&s;s of Heart, in <HI>&s;tooping</HI> (yes. Madam, that was then the proudly proper Word, in the Elevation wherein I found my&s;elf) to forgive her! &mdash; And, what! &s;hould I not forgive a Creature for that very Ba&s;e|ne&s;s, which, happily with&s;tood, had &s;o largely con|tributed to exalt me? Indeed, my dear good Ladies, permit me to repeat, I could not chu&s;e but to for|give her! &mdash; How could I?&mdash;And would it not have been out of Character in me, and again&s;t all
<PB N="71" REF="76">
Expectation of my high-&s;oul'd (tho' &s;ometimes, as in my Ca&s;e, for a great while together, meanly-acting) Ma&s;ter, if I had not? &mdash;</P>
<P>Would it not have &s;hewn him, that the low|born <HI>Pamela</HI> was incapable of a generous Action, had &s;he refu&s;ed the <HI>only</HI> Reque&s;t her humble Con|dition had given her the Opportunity of granting, at that time, with Innocence? Would he not have thought the humble Cottager as capable of In&s;o|lence, and Vengeance too, in her Turn, as the better|born? And that &s;he wanted but the Power, to &s;hew that unrelenting Temper by which &s;he had &s;o griev|ou&s;ly &s;uffer'd?&mdash;And might not this have given him Room to think me (and to have re&s;umed and pro&s;ecuted his Purpo&s;es accordingly) fitter for an arrogant kept Mi&s;tre&s;s, than an humble and obliged Wife? &mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;ee, (might he not have &s;aid?) the Girl has &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions and Re&s;entments; and &s;he that has, will be <HI>acted,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>govern'd,</HI> by them.&mdash; I will improve upon the Hint &s;he her&s;elf has now given me, by her inexorable Temper: &mdash; I will gratify her Revenge, till I turn it upon her&s;elf: I will indulge her Pride, till I make it admini&s;ter to her Fall: For a Wife I cannot think of, in the low|born Cottager; e&s;pecially when &s;he has lurking in her all the Pride and Arrogance (you know, my Ladies, his haughty way of &s;peaking of our Sex) of the better-de&s;cended. &mdash; And by a little Per&s;e|verance, and watching her unguarded Hours, and applying Temptations to her Pa&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall fir&s;t di&s;cover them, and then make my Advantage of them.&mdash;</P>
<P>Might not this have been the Language, and this the Re&s;olution, of &s;uch a dear wicked Intriguer?&mdash; For, my Lady, you can hardly conceive the Strug|gles he apparently had to bring down his high Spirit

to &s;o humble a Level.

And perhaps downright Violence might have been u&s;ed, if he could not on one hand have &s;ub|du'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, nor on the other, have overcome his Pride. A Pride, that every one, reflecting upon the Di&s;parity of Birth and Condition between us, would have dignify'd with the Name of <HI>Decency</HI>; a Pride that was become &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential Part of the dear Gentleman's Character, in this In&s;tance of a Wife, that altho' he knew he could not keep it up, if he made <HI>me</HI> happy, yet it was no &s;mall Mo|tive in his chu&s;ing me, in one re&s;pect, becau&s;e he expected from me more Humility, more Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, than he thought he had Rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf would be paid him, by a Lady equally born and educated: And of this I will &s;end your Lady&s;hip an In&s;tance, in a Tran&s;cription from that Part of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 311. <HI>&amp; &s;eq.</HI> beginning at Line 35.</NOTE> my Journal you have not &s;een, of his Le&s;&s;ons to me, on the Occa&s;ion your Lady&s;hip &s;o well remembers, of my incurring his Di&s;plea&s;ure by interpo&s;ing between your&s;elf and him <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 316.</NOTE>, in your Mi&s;under&s;tanding at the Hall; for, Madam, I in|tend to &s;end, at times, any thing I think worthy of your Lady&s;hip's Attention, out of tho&s;e Papers you were &s;o kind as to excu&s;e me from &s;ending you in the Lump, and many of which mu&s;t needs have appeared very impertinent to &s;uch Judges.</P>

<P>I hope, from what I have &s;aid, it will appear to your Lady&s;hip, and to Lady <HI>Betty</HI> too, that I am ju&s;tify'd, or at lea&s;t excu&s;able, in pardoning Mrs. <HI>Jewkes:</HI> And I have yet another Rea&s;on behind, for doing &s;o, had &s;he been as ab&s;olutely in my Power, as the Wi&s;h of the mo&s;t re&s;enting Per&s;on in the World could have made her; and that is, the Hope I had, that the poor Creature, by being continued in a Fa|mily where the Gentleman gave Hopes of &s;o de&s;ire|able a Reformation, and where the Example of the Per&s;on he was about to honour in &s;o eminent a De|gree, beyond all that could have been hoped for by her a few Days before, might, po&s;&s;ibly contribute to make her change her Manner of Thinking, as well as Acting.</P>
<P>I looked upon the poor Wretch, in all her Deport|ment to me, in my Days of Trial, as one devoted to Perdition, by her own Act and Deed; as one who
<PB N="74" REF="79">
had no Regard to a future State, and who, while &s;he could live in Ea&s;e and Plenty for a wretched poor Term of Years, the Remainder of an ill-&s;pent Life, cared not what &s;he did, and was ready to undertake any thing which Per&s;ons of Power and Riches would put her upon: That even were &s;he to be turned off di&s;gracefully, at my De&s;ire, be&s;ides &s;hewing my&s;elf to be of an implacable Spirit, which &s;ome People would have imputed to right, &s;ome to wrong Mo|tives, as they favoured me or not, &s;he might be en|tertained by &s;ome pro&s;tigate Per&s;ons, to who&s;e Ba&s;e|ne&s;s &s;uch a Woman might be u&s;eful; and that then her Power to do Mi&s;chief might be augmented, and &s;he might go on more &s;ucce&s;sfully to do the Devil'; Work, and &s;everal innocent Creatures might be in|tangled, like &s;o many thoughtle&s;s Flies, in the in&s;naring Web of this venomous-hearted Spider, which I had &s;o happily e&s;caped. Is it not better then, thought I, if I can impre&s;s <HI>Conviction</HI> upon the poor Wretch, whom its hopeful Forerunner <HI>Shame</HI> had already taken hold of, and add the delightful Hope of Mi&s;chiefs prevented, to that of a Soul reclaimed ? And may not I, who have been &s;o hardly u&s;ed by her, for <HI>that</HI> very Rea&s;on, have more Influence upon her, than any other Per&s;on, even the be&s;t of Divines, could have? &mdash; When <HI>I</HI> talk to her in a virtuous Way, will &s;he not &s;ee, that I talk from <HI>Example,</HI> (pardon my Pre&s;umption, Madam, in &s;aying &s;o) as well as <HI>Precept?</HI> (Will &s;he not &s;ee, that tho&s;e Principles mu&s;t proceed from a right Direction, a Direction <HI>wor|thy</HI> of being followed, which could make a Sufferer by her, forgive as readily as &s;he could err; and in Hopes of reclaiming her to the Paths of Virtue, for|get that &s;he was either her Enemy or her Superior, tho' the one &s;he had Rea&s;on to apprehend, and the other &s;he &s;aw I was become?</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="80">Nay, would not this Behaviour of mine, very pro|bably, operate on a much higher and nobler Subject, her dear naughty Ma&s;ter, and let <HI>him</HI> &s;ee the Force and Amiablene&s;s of a virtuous Habit? that there mu&s;t be &s;omething in tho&s;e Laws, that could make &s;o young a Creature pur&s;ue them, in an In&s;tance &s;o dif|ficult to &s;ome Minds, (and e&s;pecially to the Pa&s;&s;ion|ate and High-born) that of forgiving Injuries, when in one's Power to re&s;ent, and of returning Good for Evil?</P>
<P>And then, when no &s;ullen Behaviour to the poor Wretch, on my Side, took Place; no di&s;tant Airs were affected, no angry Brow put on, nor Sharpne&s;s of Speech, to one who might expect all the&s;e from me; would it not &s;hew him, that I was &s;incere in my Forgivene&s;s? that I was not able to bear Malice? was a Stranger to Revenge? had truly that Softne&s;s of Nature, and Placablene&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition, which he would wi&s;h for in a Per&s;on he thought to honour; which he holds to be the greate&s;t Merit in our Sex; and which, I dare &s;ay, your Lady&s;hip will join with me in Opinion, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for a happy Life in the Per&s;on who is his Wife?</P>
<P>Then I have no Notion of that &s;light Di&s;tinction I have &s;o often heard, between <HI>forgive</HI> and <HI>forget,</HI> when Per&s;ons have a mind to &s;plit Hairs, and to di|&s;tingui&s;h away their Chri&s;tian Duties by a Word, and &s;ay, I <HI>mu&s;t forgive &s;uch an Action, but I will never forget it:</HI> When I would rather &s;ay, <HI>I will remember &s;uch an Action, in order for my future Guard</HI>; but <HI>I will forgive it as often as I remember it, or el&s;e I will try to forget it for ever, if it will occa&s;ion a Breach in my Chri&s;tian Charity.</HI></P>
<P>After what I have &s;aid, I will not name le&s;&s;er Con&s;iderations, &s;uch as that of my being forced to accompany with the poor Woman, and my being de&s;titute of the Company of my own Sex, but of
<PB N="76" REF="81">
&s;uch as were too inferior and &s;tupid for me to take Notice of, in the Pro&s;pect before me.</P>
<P>But one thing I may mention further: Might it not, Ladies, be right, that by keeping her, I &s;hould make the World think, that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had not gone &s;uch very wicked Lengths, as would have been ima|gin'd, if &s;he had not been &s;upportable to me in the &s;ame Hou&s;e? Which, moreover, tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who might not know tho&s;e Rea&s;ons which it was not to your dear Brother's Credit to give, might have im|puted to me as Arrogance, or Revenge; and &s;o brought &s;till greater Di&s;grace upon the Choice he had made of me, as if I would take as much upon me, as tho' I were to be the Obliger in&s;tead of the Obliged; and who knows, be&s;ides, what &s;he might have reported of both, had &s;he been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>How then, deare&s;t Ladies, if the&s;e Con&s;iderations have any Weight, could I act otherwi&s;e than I did, either with re&s;pect to your honoured Brother, my|&s;elf or the poor Woman?

<P>But your dear Brother has ju&s;t &s;ent me Word, that Supper waits for me; and the Po&s;t, moreover, being going off, I defer till the next Opportunity what I have to &s;ay as to the&s;e good Effects; and am, mean time,</P>

<P><PB N="85" REF="90">I have already, with the&s;e tran&s;cribed Letters of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> written a great deal: But neverthele&s;s, as there yet remains one Pa&s;&s;age in your Lady&s;hip's Letter, relating to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> that &s;eems to require an An&s;wer, I will take Notice of it, if I &s;hall not quite tire your Patience.</P>
<P>That Pa&s;&s;age is this;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lady <HI>Betty</HI> rightly ob|&s;erves, &s;ays your Lady&s;hip, That he knew what a vile Woman &s;he [Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>] was, when he put you into her Power; and, no doubt, im|ploy'd her, becau&s;e he was &s;ure, &s;he would an&s;wer all his Purpo&s;es: And that therefore &s;he &s;hould have had very little Opinion of the Sincerity of his Reformation, while he was &s;o &s;olicitous in keeping her there."</Q></P>
<P>I make no doubt, Madam, that Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> was placed there, as one who would be &s;ub&s;ervient to every bad De&s;ign; and that this was the Rea&s;on of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s cau&s;ing me to be carried off to that Hou&s;e: But then this was a Proof too of my hope|le&s;s Condition, and of my want of Power to make his Reformation any Part of my Terms.</P>
<P>Alas! Madam, I was to take him as I found him, as I have already hinted, glad of my own Safety; and had only to hope, that God (and HE only could do it; for neither Law nor Ju&s;tice had &s;tood in the naughty Gentleman's Way) would per|fect the good Work already begun in him; and having fir&s;t made him refrain from what he had ab&s;olutely determin'd upon, would next let him &s;ee his Error, and at la&s;t give him Grace to re|form.</P>
<P>But Lady <HI>Betty</HI> adds,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That had &s;he been in my Ca&s;e, &s;he would have had one Struggle for Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>'s Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, let it have been taken as it would; and he that was &s;o well plea&s;ed
<PB N="86" REF="91">
with my Virtue, mu&s;t have thought this a na|tural Con&s;equence of it, if he was in Earne&s;t to reclaim."</Q></P>
<P>But, alas! Madam, he was not &s;o well plea&s;ed with my Virtue for Sake's &s;ake, as Lady <HI>Betty</HI> thinks he was. He would have been glad, at that very Time, to have found me le&s;s re&s;olved on that &s;core. He did not &s;o much as <HI>pretend</HI> to be in Earne&s;t to reclaim: No, not he!</P>
<P>He had entertained, as it proved, a &s;trong Pa&s;|&s;ion for me. This Pa&s;&s;ion had been heighten'd by <HI>my</HI> re&s;i&s;ting of it. His Pride, and the Advantages he had both of Per&s;on and Fortune, would not let him brook Controul; and when he could not have me upon his own Terms, God turn'd his evil Purpo&s;es to good ones, and he re&s;olved to &s;ubmit to my own, or rather to &s;uch as he found I would not yield to him without. For all this time, I had no Terms to propo&s;e. Neither my low Fortunes, my unju&s;t Captivity, nor my Sex, nor unexperienc'd Youth, (not a Soul near me, whom I could call my Friend, or who&s;e Advice I could ask) permitted me to offer at making Terms with him, had I been di&s;|po&s;ed to have di&s;puted his Will, or his Interce&s;&s;ion for the Woman; which, as I have &s;aid, I was not. I had but one &s;teady Purpo&s;e to adhere to, and having Grace given me to adhere to that, he re&s;olved, &s;ince he could not conquer his Pa&s;&s;ion for me, to make me his with Honour. But &s;till, I doubt, as I &s;aid, this was not for the Love of Virtue at that time. That came afterwards, and I hope will be always his governing Motive, in his future Actions; and then I &s;hall be happy indeed!</P>
<P>But Lady <HI>Betty</HI> thinks,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was to blame to put Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> upon a Foot, in the Pre&s;ent I made on my Nuptials, with Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI>"</Q>
But the Ca&s;e was rather this, That I put Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> on a Foot with
<PB N="87" REF="92">
Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI>; for the dear Gentleman had <HI>named</HI> the Sum he would have me give Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 188.</NOTE>; and I would not give Mrs. <HI>Jervis le&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e I loved her better; nor <HI>more</HI> could I give her, on that Occa|&s;ion, without making &s;uch a Difference between two Per&s;ons equal in Station, on a Solemnity too where one was pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;ting, the other not, as would have &s;hewn &s;uch a Partiality, as might have induced their Ma&s;ter to conclude, I was not &s;o &s;incere in my Forgivene&s;s as he hoped from me, and as I really was.</P>
<P>But a &s;tronger Rea&s;on &s;till was behind; that I could, in a much more agreeable manner, both to Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and my&s;elf, &s;hew my Love and my Gratitude to the dear good Woman&punc; And this I have taken care to do, in the manner I will &s;ub|mit to your Lady&s;hip; at the Tribunal of who&s;e Judgment I am willing all my Actions, re&s;pecting your dear Brother, &s;hall be try'd: And I hope, your Lady&s;hip will not think me a too profu&s;e or lavi&s;h Creature; I hope you won't have Rea&s;on for it: Yet if you think you have, pray, my dear Lady, don't &s;pare me; for if you &s;hall judge me pro|fu&s;e in one Article, I will endeavour to &s;ave it in another.</P>
<P>But I will make what I have to &s;ay on this Head the Subject of a Letter by it&s;elf. And am, mean time,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is needful, in order to let you more intelligibly into the Subject where I left off in my la&s;t, that your Lady&s;hip &s;hould know, that your generous Bro|ther has made me his Almoner, as I was my late dear Lady's; and has order'd Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> to pay me 50 <HI>l.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 342.</NOTE> Quarterly, for Purpo&s;es of which he requires no Account, tho' I have one always <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>p.</HI> 352.</NOTE> ready to produce; and he has given me other Sums to inable me to do all the Good I can to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Objects, at my fir&s;t &s;etting out. Thus inabled, your Lady&s;hip knows not how many hone&s;t Hearts I have made glad already, and how many I hope to rejoice before a Year is at an End, and yet come within my Limits.</P>
<P>Now, Madam, as I knew Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> was far from being ea&s;y in her Circum&s;tances, thinking her|&s;elf obliged to pay old <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 92.</NOTE> Debts for two extrava|gant Children who are both dead; and maintaining in Schooling and Cloaths three of their Children, which always keeps her bare; I took upon me one Day, as &s;he and I &s;at together, at our Needles, to &s;ay to her, (as we are always running over old Stories, when we are alone) My good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> will you allow me to ask you after your own pri|vate Affairs, and if you are tolerably ea&s;y in them?</P>
<P>You are very good, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, to con|cern your&s;elf about my poor Matters, &s;o much as you have to imploy your Thoughts about, and &s;o much as every Moment of your Time is taken up from the Hour you ri&s;e, to the Time of your Re&s;t.
<PB N="89" REF="94">
But I can with great Plea&s;ure attribute it to your Bounty, and that of my honoured Ma&s;ter, that I am ea&s;ier and ea&s;ier every Day.</P>
<P>But tell me, my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;aid I, how your Matters <HI>particularly</HI> &s;tand. I love to mingle Concerns with my Friends, and as I hide nothing from <HI>you,</HI> I hope you'll treat <HI>me</HI> with equal Free|dom; for I always loved you, and always will; and nothing but Death &s;hall divide our Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>She had Tears of Gratitude in her Eyes, and taking off her Spectacles, I cannot bear, &s;aid &s;he, &s;o much Goodne&s;s! &mdash; Oh! my Lady! &mdash;</P>
<P>Oh! my <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;ay, reply'd I.&mdash;How often mu&s;t I chide you for calling me any thing but your <HI>Pamela,</HI> when we are alone together? &mdash;</P>
<P>My Heart, &s;aid &s;he, will bur&s;t with your Good|ne&s;s! &mdash; I cannot bear it!&mdash;</P>
<P>But you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> bear it, and bear &s;till wor&s;e Exer|ci&s;es to your grateful Heart, I can tell you that: A pretty thing, truly! Here, I a poor helple&s;s Girl, rai&s;ed from Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s, by the Genero|&s;ity of the be&s;t of Gentlemen, only becau&s;e I was young and &s;ightly, &s;hall put on Lady-Airs to a Gentlewoman born, the Wi&s;dom of who&s;e Years, and her faithful Services, and good Management, make her a much greater Merit in this Family, than I can pretend to have! &mdash; And return, &s;hall I? in the Day of my Power, In&s;ult and Haugh|ine&s;s for the Kindne&s;s and Benevolence I received from her in that of my Indigence! &mdash; Indeed, I won't forgive you my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> if I think you capable of looking upon me in any other Light than as your Daughter; for you have been a Mother to me, when the Ab&s;ence of my own could not afford me the Comfort, and good Coun&s;el, I received every Day from you.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="95">Then moving my Chair nearer her, and taking her Hand, and wiping, with my Handkerchief in my o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her, her reverend Cheek, Come, come, my dear &s;econd Mother, &s;aid I, call me your Daughter, your <HI>Pamela:</HI> I have pa&s;&s;ed many &s;weet Hours with you under that Name: And as I have but too &s;eldom &s;uch an Opportunity as this, open to me your wor|thy Heart, and let me know, if I cannot make my <HI>&s;econd</HI> Mother as ea&s;y and happy, as our dear Ma&s;ter has made my <HI>fir&s;t?</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>She hung her Head on her Shoulder, and I waited till the Di&s;charge of her Tears gave Time for Ut|terance to her Words; provoking only her Speech, by &s;aying, You u&s;ed to have Three Grandchildren to provide for in Cloaths and Schooling. They are all living, I hope?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, they are living: And your la&s;t Bounty (Twenty Guineas was a great Sum, and all at once!) made me very ea&s;y, and very happy!&mdash;</P>
<P>How ea&s;y, and how happy, Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI></P>
<P>Why, my dear Lady, I paid Five to one old Creditor of my unhappy Sons; Five to a &s;econd; and Two-and-an-half to two others, in Proportion to their re&s;pective Demands; and with the other Five I paid off all Arrears of the poor Childrens Schooling and Maintenance, and every one is &s;atisfy'd and ea&s;y, and all declare they will never do har&s;h Things by me, if they are paid no more.</P>
<P>But, tell me, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> what you owe in the World, put all together; and you and I will contrive, with Ju&s;tice to our be&s;t Friend, to do all we can, to make you quite ea&s;y; for, at your Time of Life, I cannot bear, that you &s;hall have any thing to di&s;turb you, which I can remove; and &s;o my dear Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis,</HI> let me know all.</P>
<P>Come, I know your Debts, (dear, ju&s;t, good Woman, as you are!) like <HI>David</HI>'s Sins, are ever
<PB N="91" REF="96">
before you: So come, putting my Hand in her Pocket, let me be a friendly Pick-pocket: Let me take out your Memorandum-Book, and we will &s;ee how all Matters &s;tand, and what can be done. Come, I &s;ee you are too much moved; your wor|thy Heart is too much affected (pulling out her Book, which &s;he always has about her): I will go to my Clo&s;et, and return pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>So I left her to recover her Spirits, and retir'd with the good Woman's Book to my Clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Your dear Brother &s;tepping into the Parlour ju&s;t after I had gone out, Where's your Lady, Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> &s;aid he; and being told, came up to me, What ails the good Woman below, my Dear? &s;aid he: I hope you and &s;he have had no Words!</P>
<P>No, indeed, Sir, an&s;wer'd I. &mdash; If we had, I am &s;ure it would have been my Fault: But I have picked her Pocket of her Memorandum-Book, in order to look into her private Affairs, to &s;ee if I cannot, with Ju&s;tice to our common Benefactor, make her as ea&s;y as you, Sir, have made my other dear Parents.</P>
<P>A Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;aid the dear Gentleman, upon my Charmer's benevolent Heart! &mdash; I will leave every thing to your Di&s;cretion, my Dear! &mdash; Do all the Good you prudently can to your Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI></P>
<P>I cla&s;ped my bold Arms about him, the &s;tarting Tear te&s;tifying my Gratitude: Deare&s;t, dear Sir, &s;aid I, you affect me as much, as I did Mrs. <HI>Jervis:</HI> And if any one but you had a Right to ask, What ails your <HI>Pamela?</HI> as you do, What ails Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, I am hourly &s;o much oppre&s;s'd by your Goodne&s;s, that there is hardly any bearing one's own Joy.</P>
<P>He &s;aluted me, and &s;aid, I was a dear obliging Creature. But, &s;aid he, I came to tell you, that after we have din'd, we'll take a Turn, if you plea&s;e,
<PB N="92" REF="97">
to Lady <HI>Arthur</HI>'s: She has a Family of <HI>London</HI> Friends for her Gue&s;ts, and begs I will prevail upon you to give her your Company, and attend you my&s;elf, only to drink Tea with her; for I have told her, we are to have Friends to &s;up with us.</P>
<P>I will attend you, Sir, reply'd I, mo&s;t willingly; altho' I doubt I am to be made a Shew of.</P>
<P>Something like it, &s;aid he &mdash; For &s;he has pro|mis'd them this Favour.</P>
<P>I need not dre&s;s otherwi&s;e than I am?</P>
<P>No, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I was always what he wi&s;hed me to be.</P>
<P>So he left me to my <HI>good Works,</HI> (tho&s;e were his kind Words) and I ran over Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Ac|counts, and found a Balance drawn of all her Mat|ters, in one Leaf, in a very clear manner, and a thankful Acknowlegement to God, for her Ma&s;ter's la&s;t Bounty,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which had inabled her to give Sati&s;|faction to others, and do her&s;elf great Plea&s;ure,"</Q> as &s;he had written underneath.</P>
<P>The Balance of all was 35 <HI>l.</HI> 11 <HI>s.</HI> and odd Pence; and I went to my E&s;critoire, and took out 40 <HI>l.</HI> and down I ha&s;ted to my good Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> And I &s;aid, to her, Here, my dear good Friend, is your Pocket-Book; but are 35 or 36 <HI>l.</HI> all you owe or are bound for in the World?</P>
<P>It is, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, and enough too. It is a great Sum; but 'tis in Four Hands, and they are all in pretty good Circum&s;tances; and &s;o convinced of my Hone&s;ty, that they will never trouble me for it; for I have reduced the Debt every Year &s;omething, &s;ince I have been in my Ma&s;ter's Ser|vice.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall it ever be in any Body's <HI>Power,</HI> &s;aid I, to trouble you. I'll tell you how we'll order it.</P>
<P>So I &s;at down and made her &s;it down by me, Here, my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> is 40 <HI>l.</HI> It is not &s;o
<PB N="93" REF="98">
much to me now, as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 92.</NOTE> Two Guineas were to you, that you would have given me, if I would have accepted of them, at my going away from this Hou&s;e, to my Father's, as I thought. But I will not <HI>give</HI> it you neither, at lea&s;t at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> as you &s;hall hear: Indeed I won't make you &s;o unea&s;y as that comes to. But here take this, and pay the Thirty-five Pounds odd Money to the utmo&s;t Farthing; and the remaining Four Pounds odd will be a little Fund in Advance towards the Childrens Schooling. And thus you &s;hall repay it. I always de&s;igned, as our dear Ma&s;ter added Five Guineas <HI>per Annum</HI> to your Salary, in Acknowlegement of the Plea&s;ure he took in your Services, when I was <HI>Pamela Andrews,</HI> to add Five Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> to it from the Time I became Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> But from that time, for &s;o many Years to come, you &s;hall receive no more than you did, till the whole Forty Pounds be repaid. And &s;o, my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> you won't have any Obligation to me, you know, but for the Advance; and that is a poor Matter, not to be &s;poken of: And I will have Leave for it, for fear I &s;hould die.</P>
<P>Had your Lady&s;hip &s;een the good dear Woman's Behaviour on this Occa&s;ion, you would never have forgot it. She could not &s;peak: Tears ran down her Cheeks in plentiful Currents: her mode&s;t Hand put gently from her my offering Hand, and her Bo&s;om heav'd, and &s;he &s;obb'd with the painful Tumult that &s;eem'd to &s;truggle within her, and, which for &s;ome few Moments, made her incapable of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, I ri&s;ing, and putting my Arm round her Neck, and wiping her Eyes, and ki&s;&s;ing her Cheek, &s;he cry'd, My dear, my excellent Lady! 'tis too much! too much! I cannot bear all this&mdash;And then &s;he threw her&s;elf at my Feet; for I was not

&s;trong enough to hinder it, and with uplifted Hands, May God Almighty, &s;aid &s;he &mdash; I kneeled by her, and cla&s;ping her Hands in mine, both uplifted to|gether &mdash; May God Almighty, &s;aid I, drowning her Voice with my louder Voice, ble&s;s us both together, for many happy Years! and may He ble&s;s and reward the dear Gentleman who has thus inabled me to make <HI>the Widow's Heart to &s;ing for Joy!</HI></P>
<P>Dear, good Woman, &s;aid I, ri&s;ing, and rai&s;ing her, Do you think you &s;hall outdo me in Prayers and Prai&s;es to the Fountain of all our Mercies?&mdash;Do you think you &s;hall?&mdash; And while I am impower'd to do Good to &s;o many worthy Objects <HI>abroad,</HI> &s;hall I forget to make my dear Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> happy at <HI>home?</HI></P>
<P>And thus, my Lady, did I force upon the good Woman's Acceptance the Forty Pounds.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Lady,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW re&s;ume my la&s;t Subject where I left off, that your Lady&s;hip may have the Whole before you at one View.</P>
<P>I went after Dinner, with my dear Benefactor, to Lady <HI>Arthur</HI>'s; and met with fre&s;h Calls upon me for Humility, having the too natural Effects of the Prai&s;es and pro&s;e&s;&s;ed Admiration of that Lady's Gue&s;ts, as well as my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s, and tho&s;e
<PB N="95" REF="100">
of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Arthur,</HI> to guard my&s;elf again&s;t: And your good Brother was plea&s;ed to entertain me in the Chariot, going and coming, with an Account of the Orders he had given in relation to the <HI>London</HI> Hou&s;e, which is actually taken, and the Furniture he &s;hould direct for it; &s;o that I had no Opportunity to tell him what I had done in relation to Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI></P>
<P>But after Supper, retiring from Company to my Clo&s;et, when his Friends were gone, he came up to me about our u&s;ual Bed-time: He inquired kindly after my Imployment, which was trying to read in the <HI>French Telemachus:</HI> For, my Lady, I am learn|ing <HI>French,</HI> I'll a&s;&s;ure you! And who, do you think, is my Ma&s;ter? &mdash; Why, the be&s;t I <HI>could</HI> have in the World, your deare&s;t Brother, who is plea&s;ed to &s;ay I am no Dunce: How inexcu&s;able &s;hould I be, if I was, with &s;uch a Ma&s;ter, who teaches me on his Knee, and rewards me with a Ki&s;s whenever I do well, and &s;ays, I have already nearly ma&s;ter'd the Accent and Pronunciation, which he tells me is a great Diffi|culty got over.</P>
<P>I reque&s;ted him to render for me into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> two or three Places that were beyond my Reach; and when he had done it, he asked me, in <HI>French,</HI> What I had done for Mrs. <HI>Jervis?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aid, Permit me, Sir, (for I am not Proficient enough to an&s;wer you in my new Tongue) in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to &s;ay, I have made the good Woman quite happy; and if I have your Approbation, I &s;hall be as much &s;o my&s;elf in this In&s;tance, as I am in all others.</P>
<P>I dare an&s;wer for your Prudence, my Dear, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay; but this is your Favourite: Let me know, when you have &s;o bountiful a Heart to Strangers, what you do for your Favourites?</P>
<P>I then &s;aid, Permit my bold Eye, Sir, to watch yours, as I obey you; and you know you mu&s;t turn from me then, or el&s;e how &s;hall I look you in the
<PB N="96" REF="101">
Face? how &s;ee, as I proceed, whether you are di&s;|plea&s;ed? for you will not chide me in Words, &s;o partial have you the Goodne&s;s to be to all my Foibles.</P>
<P>He put his Arm round my Wai&s;t, and looked down now-and-then, as I de&s;ired; for, O Madam, he is all Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Goodne&s;s to his unwor|thy yet grateful <HI>Pamela!</HI> And I told him all I have written to your Lady&s;hip about the Forty Pounds.&mdash; And now, dear Sir, &s;aid I, half hiding my Face on his Bo&s;om, you have heard what I have done, chide or beat your <HI>Pamela,</HI> if you plea&s;e: It &s;hall be all kind from you, and Matter of future Direction and Caution.</P>
<P>He rai&s;ed my Head, and ki&s;&s;ed me two or three times, &s;aying, Thus then I chide, I beat, my An|gel!&mdash;And yet I have one Fault to find with you; and let Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> if not in Bed, come up to us, and hear what it is; for I will <HI>expo&s;e</HI> you as you de&s;erve before her. My <HI>Polly</HI> being in Hearing, attending to know if I wanted her A&s;&s;i&s;tance to undre&s;s, I bad her call Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI> And tho' I thought from his kind Looks, and kind Words, as well as tender Be|haviour, that I had not much to fear, yet I was im|patient to know what my Fault was, for which I was &s;o to be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The good Woman came, and as &s;he enter'd with all that Mode&s;ty which is &s;o graceful in her, he moved his Chair further from me, and, with a &s;et A&s;pect, but not unplea&s;ant, &s;aid, &mdash; Step in, Mrs. <HI>Jervis:</HI> Your Lady (for &s;o, Madam, he will always call me to Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and the Servants) has incurred my Cen|&s;ure, and I would not tell her in what, till I had you Face to Face.</P>
<P>She look'd &s;urpris'd &mdash; now on me, now on her dear Ma&s;ter; and I, not knowing what he would &s;ay, looked a little attentive.&mdash;I am &s;orry&mdash;I am very

&s;orry for it, Sir! &s;aid &s;he, court'&s;ying low. &mdash; But &s;hould be more &s;orry, if <HI>I</HI> were the unhappy Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Why, Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I can't &s;ay but it is on your Account that I mu&s;t blame her.</P>
<P>This gave us both Confu&s;ion, but e&s;pecially the good Woman; for &s;till I hoped much from his kind Behaviour to me ju&s;t before.&mdash;And &s;he &s;aid, Indeed Sir, I could never de&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>He interrupted her, My Charge again&s;t you, <HI>Pa|mela,</HI> &s;aid he, is that of Niggardline&s;s, and no other; for I will put you both out of your Pain: You ought not to have found out the Method of Repayment.</P>
<P>The dear Creature, &s;aid he, to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> &s;el|dom does any thing that can be mended; but, I think, when your good Conduct de&s;erved an annual Acknowlegement from me, in Addition to your Sa|lary, the Lady &s;hould have &s;hewed her&s;elf no le&s;s plea&s;ed with your Service, than the Gentleman.&mdash; Had it been for old Acquaintance-&s;ake, for Sex-&s;ake, &s;he &s;hould not have given me Cau&s;e to upbraid her on this Head. &mdash; But I will tell you, that you mu&s;t look upon the Forty Pounds you have, as the Effect of a ju&s;t Di&s;tinction on many Accounts; and your Salary from la&s;t Quarter-day &s;hall be advanced, as the dear Niggard intended it &s;ome Years hence; and let me only add, that when my <HI>Pamela</HI> fir&s;t begins to &s;hew a Coldne&s;s to her Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I &s;hall then &s;u|&s;pect &s;he is beginning to decline in that humble Virtue which is now peculiar to her&s;elf, and makes her the Delight of all who conver&s;e with her.</P>
<P>This was what he was plea&s;ed to <HI>&s;ay:</HI> Thus, with the mo&s;t graceful Genero&s;ity, and a Noblene&s;s of Mind <HI>truly</HI> peculiar to him&s;elf, was he plea&s;ed to <HI>act:</HI> And what, does your Lady&s;hip think, could Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> or I &s;ay to him? &mdash; Why indeed nothing at all!&mdash;We could only look upon one another, with
<PB N="98" REF="103">
our Eyes full, and our Hearts full, of a Gratitude that would not permit either of us to &s;peak, but which expre&s;s'd it&s;elf at la&s;t in a Manner he was plea&s;ed to call more elegant than Words, and that was, with uplifted folded Hands, and Tears of Joy.</P>
<P>Oh my dear Lady! how many Opportunities have the beneficent <HI>Rich</HI> to make <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> as well as their <HI>Fellow-creatures,</HI> happy! All that I could think, or &s;ay, or act, was but my Duty before; what a Sen&s;e of Obligation then mu&s;t I lie under to this mo&s;t generous of Men!</P>
<P>But here let me put an End to this tedious Sub|ject; the principal Part of which can have no Ex|cu&s;e, if it may not &s;erve as a Proof of my chearful Compliance with your Lady&s;hip's Commands, That I recite <HI>every</HI> thing that is of Concern to me, and with the &s;ame Freedom as I was wont to do to my dear Parents.</P>
<P>I have done it, and at the &s;ame time have offer'd what I had to plead in Behalf of my Conduct to the two Hou&s;ekeepers, which you expected from me; and I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e this my humble Defence, if I may &s;o call it, with the A&s;&s;urance that I am,</P>

Words, &s;peaking of his <HI>Pamela,</HI> in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 40.</NOTE> early Part of your Papers. In Truth, thou'rt a &s;urpri&s;ing Crea|ture; and every Letter we have from you, we have new Subjects to admire you for. &mdash; Do you think, Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;aid I, when I had read to the End of the Subject about Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> I will not &s;oon &s;et out to hit this charming Girl a Box of the Ear or two?</P>
<P>For what, Lady <HI>Davers?</HI> &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>For what! reply'd I.&mdash;Why, don't you &s;ee how many Slaps of the Face the bold Slut hits me? &mdash; <HI>I'll</HI> LADY-AIRS her! I will!&mdash;<HI>I'll</HI> teach her to reproach me, and &s;o many of her Betters, with her Cottage Excellencies, and Improvements that &s;hame our Education.</P>
<P>Why, you dear charming <HI>Pamela,</HI> did you only exceed me in <HI>Words,</HI> I could forgive you; for there may be a Knack, and a Volubility, as to <HI>Words,</HI> that a natural Talent may &s;upply; but to be thus outdone in <HI>Thought</HI> and in <HI>Deed,</HI> who can bear it? and in &s;o young an In&s;ulter too!</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Pamela,</HI> look to it, when I &s;ee you: You &s;hall feel the Weight of my Hand, or&mdash;the Pre&s;&s;ure of my Lip, one or t'other, depend on it, very quick|ly: For here, in&s;tead of my &s;tooping, as I had thought it would be, to call <HI>you</HI> Si&s;ter, I &s;hall be forced to think in a little while, that you ought not to own <HI>me</HI> as <HI>yours,</HI> till I am nearer your Standard.</P>
<P>But to come to Bu&s;ine&s;s. I will &s;ummarily take Notice of the following Particulars in all your obliging Letters, in order to convince you of my Friend&s;hip, by the Freedom of my Ob&s;ervations on the Subjects you touch upon.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, I am highly plea&s;ed with what you write of the Advantages you received from the Favour of
<PB N="100" REF="105">
my dear Mother; and as you know many Things of her by your Attendance upon her, in the la&s;t three or four Years of her Life, I mu&s;t de&s;ire you will give me, as Opportunity &s;hall offer, all you can recollect in relation to the honoured Lady, and of her Behaviour and Kindne&s;s to you, and with a Retro&s;pect to your own early Beginnings, the Dawn|ings of this your bright Day of Excellence: And this not only I, but the Counte&s;s, and Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> (her Si&s;ter Lady <HI>Jenny</HI> too) with whom I am going over your Papers again, reque&s;t of you.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am much plea&s;ed with your <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Ac|count; tho' we wi&s;hed you had been more particu|lar in &s;ome Parts of it; for we are greatly taken with your De&s;criptions, and your Conver&s;ation Pieces: Yet I own, your hone&s;t Father's Letters, and yours, a good deal &s;upply that <HI>Defect,</HI> as our Plea&s;ure in reading your Relations makes us call it. Your Pa|rents are hone&s;t, di&s;creet Folks, I &s;ee that: I have a Value for them. And you're the prudente&s;t Creature I ever knew, in all your Ways; particularly in the Advice you give them about your more di&s;tant Re|lations, and to aim at nothing beyond their natural Sphere.&mdash;Every Tittle is right, and as it &s;hould be. On the&s;e Accounts it is, that all the World will allow, that you, and your Parents too, merit the For|tune you have met with.</P>
<P N="3">3. I am highly delighted with the Account you give me of my Brother's breaking to you the Affair of <HI>Sally Godfrey,</HI> and your Conduct upon it. 'Tis a &s;weet Story, as he brought it on, and as you relate it. The Wretch has been very ju&s;t in his Account of it. But don't you think he was a &s;ad young Fel|low! Well may you be thankful for <HI>your</HI> E&s;cape; well may you!&mdash;Your Behaviour was what I admire; and &s;o we do all; but none of us think we could have imitated it in all its Parts. We are in Love
<PB N="101" REF="106">
with your charitable Reflections in favour of the poor Lady; and the more, as &s;he certainly de&s;erved them; and a better Mother too than &s;he had, and a faithfuller Lover, than &s;he met with.</P>
<P N="4">4. You have exactly hit his Temper, in your de|clared Love of Mi&s;s. I &s;ee, Child, you know your Man; and never fear but you'll hold him, if you can go on thus to act, and outdo your Sex. But I &s;hould think you might as well not in&s;i&s;t upon having Mi&s;s with you; for the Girl may be pert, perhaps in&s;olent (you know who is her Father); you'd not care to check her, for &s;everal Rea&s;ons, and this may make you unea&s;y; for, if you <HI>did,</HI> he might take it ami&s;s, let your Motives be ever &s;o good: So I think you'd better &s;ee her now-and-then at the Dairy-hou&s;e, or at School, than have her with you. &mdash; But this I leave to your own Di&s;cretion, and <HI>his</HI> good Plea&s;ure, to determine upon; for in the latter it mu&s;t re&s;t, let you, or me, or any body, &s;ay what we will.</P>
<P N="5">5. You have fully, and to our Satisfaction, an|&s;wer'd our Objections to your Behaviour to Mrs. <HI>Jewkes.</HI> We had not con&s;idered your Circum|&s;tances quite &s;o thoroughly as we ought to have done. You are a charming Girl, and all your Mo|tives are &s;o ju&s;t, that we &s;hall be a little more cau|tious for the future how we cen&s;ure you. We are particularly plea&s;ed with the Triumphs of your Inno|cence over his and her Guilt; and agree, that they are the righte&s;t and be&s;t-to-be-defended Motives for Pride that ever were &s;et before us.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I &s;ay with the Counte&s;s, This good Girl is not without her Pride; but it is the Pride that be|comes, and can only attend, the innocent Heart; and I'll warrant, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, nobody will be|come her Station &s;o well as one who is capable of &s;o worthy a Pride as this.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="107">But what a Curtain-Lecture had&s;t thou, <HI>Pamela!</HI> A noble one, do&s;t thou call it! &mdash; Why, what a Wretch ha&s;t thou got, to expect thou &s;hould&s;t never expo&s;tulate again&s;t his lordly Will, even when in the Wrong, till thou ha&s;t obey'd it, and of con&s;e|quence join'd in the Evil he impo&s;es! He &s;ays, in|deed, in <HI>&s;mall</HI> Points; but I &s;uppo&s;e he is to judge which are and which are not &s;mall.</P>
<P>Thus, I remember, my Brother him&s;elf took No|tice once of a Propo&s;al in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to grant the Crown a very great Sum to an&s;wer Civil|Li&s;t Deficiencies, which being oppo&s;ed by the Mi|nority, the Mini&s;ter found out an Expedient, that they would give the Money <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and examine into the Merits of the Demand <HI>afterwards.</HI> So we read, that, in &s;ome Countries, an accu&s;ed Per&s;on is put to Death, and try'd afterwards; and all he has to hope for while he lives, is, that his Relations, and his own Family, will be relea&s;ed from Obloquy, if an Ac|quittal en&s;ues.</P>
<P>Much good may do you with &s;uch an Husband, &s;ays Lady <HI>Betty!</HI>&mdash;Every body will <HI>admire</HI> you, but no one will have Rea&s;on to <HI>envy</HI> you upon tho&s;e Prin|ciples. Yet, I don't know how it is, but this is evident, that at pre&s;ent there is not a happier Couple in the World than you two are.</P>
<P N="6">6. I am plea&s;ed with your Promi&s;e of &s;ending me what you think I &s;hall like to &s;ee, out of tho&s;e Papers you chu&s;e not to &s;hew me collectedly: This is very obliging. You're a good Girl, and I love you dearly.</P>
<P N="7">7. We have all &s;miled at your Paradox, <HI>Pamela,</HI> that his marrying <HI>you</HI> was an In&s;tance of his Pride. The Thought, tho', is pretty enough, and ingenious: But whether it will hold or not, I won't ju&s;t now examine.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="103" REF="108">8. Your Ob&s;ervation on the <HI>Forget</HI> and <HI>Forgive</HI> we are much plea&s;ed with, and think you have di|&s;tingui&s;hed well on that Head.</P>
<P N="9">9. You are a very good Girl for &s;ending me a Copy of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s Letter. She is a charming young Lady. I always had a great Opinion of her Merit; her Letter abundantly confirms me in it. I hope you'll communicate to me every Letter that pa&s;&s;es between you; and pray &s;end me in your next a Copy of your An&s;wer to her Letter: I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, I think.</P>
<P N="10">10. I am glad with all my Heart to hear of poor <HI>Jewkes</HI>'s Reformation. Your Example carries all before it. But pray oblige me with your An&s;wer to her Letter. Don't think me unrea&s;onable: 'Tis all for your &s;ake. You mu&s;t needs know that, or you know nothing. For I think you de&s;erve all Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> &s;ays of you; and that's a great deal too.</P>
<P>Pray&mdash;have you &s;hewn <HI>Jewkes</HI>'s Letter to your good Friend? &mdash; Lady <HI>Betty</HI> wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to know (if you <HI>have</HI>) what he could &s;ay to it? for, &s;he &s;ays, it cuts him to the Quick; and I think &s;o too, if he takes it as he ought: But, as you &s;ay, he's above loving Vir|tue for <HI>Virtue's &s;ake,</HI> I warrant him. He likes it in a Wife, becau&s;e 'tis a Husband's Security again&s;t the <HI>Lex Talionis.</HI> There's a great deal in that, I can tell you. I once heard the Wretch hold an Argument, that Women had no Souls. I asked him, If he was to marry, whether he'd have his Wife <HI>act</HI> as if &s;he believ'd this Doctrine to be good? That was another thing he &s;aid: He was for having his Wife think &s;he had, he mu&s;t own: Such a Belief could do her no Harm. Ah! <HI>Pamela,</HI> Theory and Practice, never was &s;uch a Rake, for one not quite a Town De|bauchee!</P>
<P N="11">11. Your Manner of Acting by Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> with &s;o hand&s;ome a Regard to my Brother's Intere&s;t, her
<PB N="104" REF="109">
Behaviour upon it, and your Relation of the Whole, and of his generous Spirit in approving, reproving, and improving your prudent Genero&s;ity, make no incon&s;iderable Figure in your Papers. And Lady <HI>Betty</HI> &s;ays, Hang him, he has &s;ome excellent Qua|lities too!&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible not to think well of him; and his good Actions go a great way towards atone|ing for his bad. But you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> have the Glory of all! We de&s;ire particularly, that you will never omit any of tho&s;e moving Scenes, which you &s;o well de&s;cribe, be the Occa&s;ion what it will: For they are Nature, and that's your Excellence. Keep to that; for one more learned, I verily think, could not write as you do, nor in&s;truct, and delight, and <HI>move,</HI> all at once, &s;o very ingagingly.</P>
<P N="12">12. I am glad you are learning <HI>French:</HI> Thou art a happy Girl in thy Teacher, and he is a happy Man in his Scholar. We are plea&s;ed with the pretty Account you give us of his Method of In&s;tructing and Re|warding. 'Twould be &s;trange, if you did not learn any Language quickly under &s;uch Methods, and with &s;uch Encouragements, from the Man you love, were your Genius le&s;s apt than it is. But we wi&s;h'd you had inlarged on that Subject: For &s;uch Fond|ne&s;s of Men to their Wives, who have been any time marry'd, is &s;o rare and &s;o unexpected from my Brother, that we thought you &s;hould have written a Side upon that Subject at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>What a bewitching Girl art thou! What an Ex|emplar to Wives now, as well as thou wa&s;t before to Maidens! Thou can&s;t tame Lions, I dare &s;ay, if thou'd&s;t try!&mdash;Reclaim a Rake in the Meridian of his Libertini&s;m, and make &s;uch an one as my Brother not only marry thee, but love thee better at &s;everal Months End, than he did the fir&s;t Day, if po&s;&s;ible! Wonderful Girl! Yet u&s;e&s;t thou no Arts but hone&s;t ones, &s;uch as Prudence directs, Nature points out,
<PB N="105" REF="110">
and &s;uch as make Duty delightful, even command|ing mo&s;t, when thou &s;eeme&s;t mo&s;t to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned indeed, that thou ha&s;t no brutal Mind to deal with: Bad as he is, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that thou ha&s;t a &s;en&s;ible and a generous Heart to work upon; one who takes no Glory in the blind Submi&s;|&s;ion of a Slave; but, like a true <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarch, delights to reign in a free, rather than in an abject Mind. Yet is he jealous as a Tyrant of his Prero|gative: But you have found the way to lay that watchful Dragon a&s;leep, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s the golden Fruits of Content and true Plea&s;ure, the due Reward of your matchle&s;s Conduct.</P>
<P>Now, my dear <HI>Pamela,</HI> I think I have taken No|tice of the mo&s;t material Articles in your Letters, and have no more to &s;ay to you; but, Write on, and oblige us; and mind to &s;end me the Copy of your Letter to Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> of that you wrote to poor penitent <HI>Jewkes,</HI> and every Article I have written about, and all that comes into your Head, or that pa&s;&s;es, and you'll oblige</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'YOU give me, Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> very great Plea|&s;ure, to find that at length God Almighty has touch'd your Heart, and let you &s;ee, while Health and Strength la&s;ted, the Error of your Ways. &mdash; Many an unhappy one has not been &s;o graciou&s;ly touched, till they have &s;marted under &s;ome heavy Afflictions, or till they have been confin'd to the Bed of Sickne&s;s, when, perhaps, they have made Vows and Re&s;olutions, that have held them no longer than the Di&s;cipline la&s;ted: But you give me much better Hopes of the Sincerity of your Conver&s;ion; as you are &s;o well convinced, be|fore &s;ome &s;ore Evil has overtaken you: And it ought to be an Earne&s;t to you of the Divine Fa|vour, and &s;hould keep you from De&s;pondency.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As for me, it became me to forgive you, as I mo&s;t cordially did, &s;ince your U&s;age of me, as it prov'd, was but a nece&s;&s;ary Means in the Hand of Providence, to exalt me to that State of Hap|pine&s;s, in which I have every Day more and more Cau&s;e given me to rejoice, by the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t generous of Gentlemen.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But, dear Mrs. <HI>Jewkes,</HI> (for now <HI>indeed</HI> you are dear to me) let me caution you again&s;t two Things; the one, that you return not to your former Ways, and wilfully err after this Repentance; for, in this Ca&s;e, the Divine Goodne&s;s will look upon it&s;elf as mocked by you, and will withdraw it&s;elf from you, and more fearful will your State then be, than if you had never repented: The other, that you don't de&s;pair of the Divine Mercy, which has &s;o evi|dently manife&s;ted it&s;elf in your Favour, and has awakened you out of your deplorable Lethargy, without tho&s;e &s;harp Medicines and Operations that others, and perhaps <HI>not more faulty</HI> Per&s;ons, have &s;uffer'd. But go on chearfully in the happy Path which you have begun to tread.

<P>Thus, my good Lady, have I obey'd you, in tran|&s;cribing the&s;e two Letters. I will now proceed to your Lady&s;hip's twelve Articles. As to the</P>
<P N="1">1. I will oblige your Lady&s;hip, as I have Opportu|nity, in my future Letters, with &s;uch Accounts of my dear Lady's Favour and Goodne&s;s to me, as I think will be acceptable to you, and the noble Ladies you mention.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="117" REF="122">2. I am extremely delighted, that your Lady&s;hip thinks &s;o well of my dear hone&s;t Parents: Indeed they are good People, and ever had Minds that &s;et them above low and &s;ordid Actions; and God and your good Brother has rewarded them mo&s;t amply in this World, which is more than they ever expected, after a Series of Unpro&s;perou&s;ne&s;s in all they under|took.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that People in upper Life love to &s;ee how plain Nature operates in hone&s;t Minds, who have hardly any thing el&s;e for their Guide; and if I might not be thought to de|&s;cend too low for your Lady&s;hip's Attention, (for as to my&s;elf, I &s;hall, I hope, always look back with Plea&s;ure to what I <HI>was,</HI> in order to increa&s;e my Thankfulne&s;s for what I <HI>am</HI>) I would give you a Scene of Re&s;ig|nation, and contented Poverty, of which otherwi&s;e your Lady&s;hip can hardly have a Notion. I <HI>will</HI> give it, becau&s;e it will be a Scene of Nature, how|ever low, which your Lady&s;hip loves, and it &s;hall not tire you by its Length.</P>
<P>It was upon Occa&s;ion of a great Lo&s;s and Di&s;ap|pointment which happened to my dear Parents (for tho' they were never high in Life, yet were they not always &s;o low as my honoured Lady found them, when &s;he took me): My poor Father came home; and as the Lo&s;s was of &s;uch a Nature, as that he could not keep it from my Mother, he took her Hand, I remember well, and &s;aid, after he had acquainted her with it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Come, my Dear, let us take Comfort, that we did for the be&s;t. We left the I&s;&s;ue to Providence, as we ought, and that has turned it as it plea&s;ed; and we mu&s;t be content, tho' not fa|voured as we wi&s;hed. All the Bu&s;ine&s;s is, our Lot is not ca&s;t for this Life. Let us re&s;ign our&s;elves to the Divine Will, and continue to do our Duty, and this &s;hort Life will &s;oon be pa&s;t. Our
<PB N="118" REF="123">
Troubles will be quickly overblown; and we &s;hall be happy in a better, I make no Doubt."</Q></P>
<P>Then my dear Mother threw her kind Arms about his Neck, and &s;aid with Tears,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"God's Will be done, my dear Love!&mdash;All cannot be rich and happy. I am contented; and had rather &s;ay, I have a poor hone&s;t Husband, than a guilty rich one. What &s;ignifies repining? Let the World go as it will, we &s;hall have our Length and our Breadth at la&s;t. And Providence, I make no Doubt, will be a better Friend to our good Girl here, becau&s;e &s;he is good, than we could be, if this had not hap|pened,"</Q>&mdash;pointing to me, who, then about Ele|ven Years old, (for it was before my Lady took me) &s;at weeping in the Chimney Corner, over a few dying Embers of a Fire, at their moving Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, and ki&s;&s;ing both their Hands, and ble&s;&s;ing them, &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And this Length and Breadth, my dear Parents, will be, one Day, all the Rich and the Great can po&s;&s;e&s;s; and, it may be, their ungracious Heirs will trample upon their A&s;hes, and rejoice they are gone: While &s;uch a poor Girl as I, am ho|nouring the Memories of mine, who in their good Names, and good Le&s;&s;ons, will have left me the be&s;t of Portions."</Q></P>
<P>And then they both hugg'd their prating Girl to their fond Bo&s;oms, by Turns; and all three were &s;o filled with Comfort in one another, that after join|ing in a grateful Hymn, we went to Bed (what tho' &s;upperle&s;s, perhaps?) with &s;uch true Joy, that very few of the Rich and Great can have any Idea of it; I to my Loft, and they to their Ru&s;h-floor'd cleanly Bed-Room. And we have had &s;weet Sleep, and Dreams &s;o plea&s;ant, that we have reaped greater Plea&s;ures, in repeating them to one another, at our next Lei&s;ure-Hour, than, po&s;&s;ibly, we &s;hould have received, had we injoy'd the Comforts we wanted.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124">And, truly, my Lady, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that while the virtuous Poor can be ble&s;s'd with &s;uch &s;weet In|joyments as the&s;e, in contented Minds all Day, and in Dreams and Vi&s;ions at Night, I don't know whether they have not more, even of <HI>this</HI> World's Plea&s;ures, than the abounding Rich: And while the Hours of Night bear &s;o near a Proportion to tho&s;e of the Day, may not &s;uch be &s;aid, even at the wor&s;t, to pa&s;s at lea&s;t half their Lives with more Comfort than many times the di&s;temper'd Great can pretend to know?</P>
<P>For a further In&s;tance, that hone&s;t Poverty is not &s;uch a deplorable State, let me ask, What Plea&s;ure can tho&s;e over-happy People ta&s;te, who never knew that of Hunger or Thir&s;t? Like the Ea&s;tern Mon|arch I have read of, who marching at the Head of a va&s;t Army, thro' a de&s;ert Place, where was no Wa|ter, nor any thing to quench his craving Thir&s;t, at la&s;t one of his Soldiers bringing him in his na&s;ty Hel|met a little dirty Water, he greedily &s;wallowed it, and cry'd out, That he never in all his Life had ta&s;ted &s;o &s;weet a Draught! Having always before eaten be|fore he was hungry, and drank before he was thir&s;ty.</P>
<P>But when I talk or write of my dear worthy Pa|rents, how I run on!&mdash;Excu&s;e me, my good Lady; and don't think me, in this re&s;pect, too much like the Cat in the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the New <HI>Ae&s;op's Fables,</HI> &s;old by <HI>J.

But let me proceed to your Lady&s;hip's third Particular.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="120" REF="125">3.

I was afraid &s;ome Blood had been &s;hed on the Occa&s;ion by the dear Gentleman: For Mi&s;s was ruin'd, and, as to her, nothing could have happened wor&s;e. And the Regard I have for his future Happine&s;s, which co&s;ts me in my con&s;tant Supplications for him in private, many a Tear, gave me great Apprehen&s;ions, and not a little Unea&s;ine&s;s. But as your Lady&s;hip tells me, that he gave me a ju&s;t Account, I am very happy again.</P>
<P>What makes one, my dear Lady, in our mo&s;t pro&s;perous Condition, be always intermingling one's Fears and one's Anxieties of what <HI>may be;</HI> and by that Means rob one's &s;elf of the Prime of one's be&s;t worldly Injoyments? &mdash; Is this Apprehen&s;ivene&s;s, does your Lady&s;hip think, implanted in our Natures (for I know I am not vapouri&s;h, nor the only Per&s;on who is thus con&s;tituted) for wi&s;e and good Ends, that we may not think our&s;elves &s;o happy here, as to make us forget, that there is a better and more per|fectly happy State, which we ought to a&s;pire after?

Yet I don't know how it is, but I have conceived a &s;trange Pa&s;&s;ion for this dear Baby: I cannot but look upon her poor Mamma as my Si&s;ter in point of Trial: And &s;hall not the pro&s;perous Si&s;ter pity and love the poor dear Si&s;ter, that, in &s;o &s;lippery a Path, has <HI>fallen,</HI> while <HI>&s;he</HI> had the Happine&s;s to keep her Feet?</P>
<P>No doubt, Mi&s;s <HI>Godfrey</HI> loved Virtue, and pre|ferred it to all Con&s;iderations: 'Tis plain &s;he did even after her Fall &mdash; when, as I have ob&s;erved in the Pa|pers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 368, 369.</NOTE> I &s;ent your Lady&s;hip, &s;he could leave Country, Parents, Friends, and the Man of all others &s;he loved be&s;t, and &s;eek a new Fortune, run the Danger of the Seas, and perhaps the Hazards of meeting with wor&s;e Men, rather than tru&s;t to her own Strength, where it had once &s;o unhappily failed her. &mdash; What a Love of Virtue for Virtue's Sake is this? I know not who could have acted up to this Part of her Character.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of your Lady&s;hip's Articles give me the greate&s;t Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction; and if I can but continue my&s;elf in the Favour of your dear Brother, and improve in that of his noble Si&s;ter, how happy &s;hall I be! I will do all I can to de&s;erve both. And I hope your Lady&s;hip will take as an In&s;tance that I would, the chearful Obedience which I pay to your

Commands, in writing to &s;o fine a Judge, &s;uch crude and indige&s;ted Stuff, as otherwi&s;e I ought to be a&s;hamed to lay before you.</P>
<P>I am impatient for the Honour, which your Lady|&s;hip makes me hope for, of your Pre&s;ence here: And yet I perplex my&s;elf with the Fear of appearing &s;o unworthy in your Eyes, when near you, as to &s;uf|fer in your Opinion; but I promi&s;e my&s;elf, that however this may be the Ca&s;e on your <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Vi&s;it, I &s;hall be &s;o much improved by the Benefits I &s;hall reap from your Le&s;&s;ons and good Example, that when|ever I &s;hall be favoured with a <HI>Second,</HI> you &s;hall have le&s;s Faults to find with me; till, as I &s;hall be more and more favoured, I &s;hall in time be ju&s;t what your Lady&s;hip will wi&s;h me to be, and of Con&s;e|quence more worthy than I am of the Honour of &s;tyling my&s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. From Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford.</HI> In An&s;wer to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s, <HI>p. 106.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are highly obliging to me in expre&s;&s;ing &s;o warmly your Wi&s;hes to have me with you. I know not any body in this World, out of our own Family, in who&s;e Company I &s;hould be happier: But my Papa won't part with me, I think; tho' I had &s;ecur'd my Mamma in my Intere&s;t; and I know <HI>Nan|cy</HI> would be glad of my Ab&s;ence, becau&s;e the dear perver&s;ly Envious thinks <HI>me</HI> more valued than <HI>&s;he</HI> is; and yet, fooli&s;h Girl, &s;he don't con&s;ider, that if her Envy be well-grounded, I &s;hould return with more than double Advantages to what I now have, improv'd by your charming Example and Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="128">My Papa affects to be in a fearful Pet at your lecturing of him &s;o ju&s;tly; for my Mamma would &s;hew it him; and he &s;ays he will po&s;itively demand Satisfaction of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> for your treating him &s;o freely. And yet he &s;hall hardly think him, he &s;ays, on a Rank with him, unle&s;s Mr. <HI>B.</HI> will, on Occa&s;ion of the new Commi&s;&s;ion, take out his <HI>Dedimus:</HI> And then if he will bring you down to <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and join with him to commit you Pri&s;oner for a Month at the Hall, all &s;hall be well.</P>
<P>It is very obliging in Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to join in your kind Invitation: But&mdash;yet I am loth to &s;ay it to you&mdash;But the Character of your worthy Gentleman, I doubt, &s;tands a little in the Way with my Papa: For he will have it, that he is ju&s;t &s;uch a Rake as is to be liked by a Lady; one that &s;aves common Appear|ances, and that's all; and is too hand&s;ome, too witty, and too enterprizing, for any <HI>hone&s;t Man,</HI> that's Si <HI>Simon</HI>'s Phra&s;e, <HI>to tru&s;t his Daughter with.</HI></P>
<P>My Mamma pleaded his being marry'd. &mdash; Ads|dines, Madam, &s;aid he, what of all that! What married Man, when a pretty Girl's in the Way, minds his Wife, except &s;he has made him &s;tand in Fear of her? and that's far from the Ca&s;e here. Why I tell you, added his peevi&s;h Highne&s;s, if our <HI>Polly</HI> &s;hould happen to &s;lip, (I thank him for his Suppo|&s;ition) he'd make his Lady nur&s;e both <HI>her</HI> and the <HI>Ba&s;tard,</HI> (another of his polite Expre&s;&s;ions) if he had a mind to it, and &s;he dur&s;t not refu&s;e him. And would you tru&s;t &s;uch a &s;pritely Girl as <HI>Polly,</HI> in the Hou&s;e with &s;uch a Fellow as that?</P>
<P>The&s;e, it &s;eems, were his Words and Rea&s;onings: I thank him for his Opinion of his Daughter. It be|comes not me to &s;ay, by what Rules my Papa judges of Mankind; Rules, however, that are not much to the Credit of his Sex: &mdash; But it made me put on very grave Airs when I came to Supper, (for after
<PB N="124" REF="129">
this Repul&s;e, and the Rea&s;ons given for it, I pre|tended Indi&s;po&s;ition, not to dine with my Papa, be|ing half-vex'd, and half-afraid of his Raillery) and he &s;aid, Why, how now, <HI>Polly!</HI> What! in the Sul|lens, Girl? I &s;aid, I &s;hould have hoped, that I never gave my Papa Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect my Conduct, and that he would have had a better Opinion of the Force which the Example and Precepts of my good Mam|ma had upon me.</P>
<P>Not your <HI>Papa</HI>'s Example then. &mdash; Very well, Saucebox: I under&s;tand you.</P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;aid I, I hope, if I may not go to <HI>Bed|ford&s;hire,</HI> you'll permit me to go to <HI>London</HI> when Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> goes.</P>
<P>No, &s;aid he, po&s;itively no!</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I have done. I could hope, however, you would inable me to give a better Rea&s;on to good Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> why I am not permitted to accept of her kind Invitation, than that which I under&s;tand you have been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign.</P>
<P>He &s;tuck his Hands in his Sides, with his u&s;ual hu|mourous Po&s;itivene&s;s, Why then tell her, &s;he is a very &s;aucy Lady, for her la&s;t Letter to you; and that her Lord and Ma&s;ter is not to be tru&s;ted; and it is my ab&s;olute Will and Plea&s;ure, that you ask me no more Que&s;tions about it.</P>
<P>I will very faithfully make this Report, Sir. Do &s;o. &mdash; And &s;o I have. &mdash; And your poor <HI>Polly Darn|ford</HI> is di&s;appointed of one of the greate&s;t Plea&s;ures &s;he could have had.</P>
<P>I can't help it. &mdash; And if you truly pity me, I can put you in a Way to make me ea&s;ier under the Di&s;ap|pointment, than otherwi&s;e I can po&s;&s;ibly be; and that is, to favour me with an Epi&s;tolary Conver&s;a|tion, &s;ince I am deny'd a Per&s;onal one; and this my Mamma joins to reque&s;t of you; and particularly, to let us know how Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s fir&s;t Vi&s;it pa&s;&s;es;
<PB N="125" REF="130">
which Mrs. <HI>Peters</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jones,</HI> who know my Lady &s;o well, likewi&s;e long to hear: And this will make us the be&s;t Amends in your Power for the Lo&s;s of your good Neighbourhood, which we had all pro|mis'd to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Denial of my Papa comes out, &s;ince I wrote the above, to be principally owing to a Propo&s;al made him of an humble Servant to one of his Daugh|ters: He won't &s;ay which, he tells us, in his u&s;ual humourous Way, le&s;t we &s;hould fall out about it.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, I tell him, the young Gentleman is to pick and chu&s;e which of the two he likes be&s;t. But be he a Duke, 'tis all one to <HI>Polly,</HI> if he is not &s;ome|thing above our common <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> Cla&s;s of Fox|hunters.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Peters</HI> your Let|ter. They admire you beyond Expre&s;&s;ion; and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> &s;ays, He does not know that ever he did any thing in all his Life, that ever gave him &s;o much inward Reproach, as his denying you the Protection of his Family, which Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 175.</NOTE> &s;ought to move him to afford you, when you were confined at the Hall, before Mr. <HI>B.</HI> came down to you, with his Heart bent on Mi&s;chief; and all he comforts him&s;elf with is, that that very Denial, as well as the other Hard&s;hips you met with, were nece&s;&s;ary to bring about that Work of Providence which was to reward your unexampled Virtue.</P>
<P>Yet, he &s;ays, he doubts he &s;hall not be thought ex|cu&s;able by you, who are &s;o exact in your own Duty, as he had the Unhappine&s;s to lo&s;e &s;uch an Opportu|nity to have done Honour to his Function, had he had the Fortitude to have done <HI>his</HI>; and he begg'd of me, &s;ome how or other, and at &s;ome time or other, to hint his Concern to you on this Head; and to hope,
<PB N="126" REF="131">
in his Name, that neither Religion nor his Cloth may &s;uffer in your Opinion, for the Fault of one of its Profe&s;&s;ors, who never was wanting in his Duty &s;o much before.</P>
<P>He had it often upon his Mind, he &s;ays, to write to you on this very Subject; but he had not the Courage; and be&s;ides, did not know how Mr. <HI>B.</HI> might take it, if he &s;hould &s;ee that Letter, as the Ca&s;e had &s;uch delicate Circum&s;tances in it, that in blaming him&s;elf, as he &s;hould very freely have done, he mu&s;t, by Implication, have ca&s;t &s;till greater Blame upon him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> is certainly a very good Man, and my Favourite for that Rea&s;on; and I hope <HI>you,</HI> that could &s;o ea&s;ily forgive the late wicked, but now peni|tent <HI>Jewkes,</HI> will overlook with Kindne&s;s a Fault in a good Man, that proceeded more from Pu&s;il|lanimity and Con&s;titution, than from Want of Prin|ciple: And once, talking of it to my Mamma and me, he accu&s;ed him&s;elf on this &s;core, to her, with Tears in his Eyes. She, good Lady, would have given you this Protection, at Mr. <HI>William</HI>'s De&s;ire; but wanted the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 174.</NOTE> Power to do it.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> how your Virtue has &s;hamed every one into &s;uch a Sen&s;e of what they ought to have done, that Good, Bad and Indifferent are &s;eeking to make Excu&s;es for pa&s;t Misbehaviour, and to promi&s;e future Amendment, like penitent Subjects returning to their Duty to their conquering Sovereign, after &s;ome unworthy Defection.</P>
<P>Happy, happy Lady! may you be ever &s;o! May you always convert your Enemies, confirm the Luke|warm, and every Day multiply your Friends, prays,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. From Sir <HI>SIMON DARNFORD</HI> to Mr. <HI>B.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LITTLE did I think I &s;hould ever have Occa&s;ion to make a formal Complaint again&s;t a Per&s;on very dear to you, and who I believe de&s;erves to be &s;o; but don't let them be &s;o proud and &s;o vain of oblig|ing and plea&s;ing you, as to make them not care how they affront every body el&s;e.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on is no other than the Wife of your Bo&s;om, who has taken &s;uch Liberties with me as ought not to be taken, and &s;ought to turn my own Child again&s;t me, and make a dutiful Girl a Rebel.</P>
<P>If People will &s;et up for Virtue, and all that, let 'em be uniformly virtuous, or I would not give a Farthing for their Pretences to it.</P>
<P>Here I have been plagued with Gouts, Rheuma|ti&s;ms, and namele&s;s Di&s;orders, ever &s;ince you left us, which have made me call for a little more Attendance than ordinary; and I had Rea&s;on to think my&s;elf &s;lighted, where an indulgent Father can lea&s;t bear to be &s;lighted, that is, where he mo&s;t loves; and that by young Up&s;tarts, who are growing up to the In|joyment of tho&s;e Plea&s;ures which have run away from me, fleeting Ra&s;cals as they are! before I was willing to part with them. And I rung and rung, and,
<PB N="128" REF="133">
Where's <HI>Polly?</HI> (for I honour the Slut with too much of my Notice) Where's <HI>Polly?</HI> was all my Cry, to every one who came up to ask what I rung for. And at la&s;t in bur&s;t the pert Slut, with an Air of A&s;|&s;urance, as if &s;he thought all mu&s;t be well the Mo|ment &s;he appeared, with, Do you want me, Papa?</P>
<P>Do I want you, Confidence! Yes, I do. Where have you been the&s;e two Hours, and never came near me, when you knew 'twas my Time to have my Foot rubbed, which gives me mortal Pain? For you mu&s;t under&s;tand, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that nobody's Hand's &s;o &s;oft as <HI>Polly's.</HI></P>
<P>She gave me a &s;aucy An&s;wer, as I was di&s;po&s;ed to think it, becau&s;e I had ju&s;t then a Twinge, that I could &s;carce bear; for Pain is a plaguy thing to a Man of my lively Spirits. Why, with a P&mdash;x to it, cannot it go and rou&s;e up &s;ome &s;tupid lethargic Ra&s;cal, who&s;e Blood is ready to &s;tagnate? There it might do &s;ome Good; and not make an hone&s;t Man mi&s;erable, as it does me, who want none of its pungent Helps to Feeling.</P>
<P>She gave me, I &s;ay, a pert An&s;wer, and turn'd upon her Heel; and not coming near me at my fir&s;t Word, I flung a Book I had in my Hand at her Head.</P>
<P>This the &s;aucy Slut (Girls now-a-days make no|thing of expo&s;ing their indulgent Parents) has men|tioned in a Letter to your Lady; and &s;he has abu&s;ed me upon it in <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Manner&mdash; Well, if you don't take &s;ome Cour&s;e with her, I mu&s;t with you, that's po&s;itive; and young as you are, and a Cripple as I am, I'll &s;tump to an appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Place, to procure to my&s;elf the Satisfaction of a Man of Honour.</P>
<P>Your Lady has written to <HI>Polly</HI> what <HI>&s;he</HI> would have &s;aid to me on this Occa&s;ion. She has reflected upon me for not reading a Book of Mortification, when I was labouring under &s;o great a Sen&s;e of it,
<PB N="129" REF="134">
and confin'd to my Elbow-Chair in one Room, whom lately half a Dozen Counties could hardly contain: She has put it into <HI>Polly</HI>'s Head to fling this very Book at her Si&s;ter's Head, in Imitation of my Ex|ample, and hopes <HI>Nancy</HI> will fling it at &s;omebody's el&s;e, till it goes all round the Hou&s;e: She reproaches me for making no better U&s;e of a <HI>good</HI> Book, as &s;he calls <HI>Rabelais</HI>'s <HI>Pantagruel,</HI> which I innocently was reading to make me the more chearfully bear my Misfortune; and runs on a Pack of Stuff about my <HI>Polly</HI>'s Eyes, and Skin, and I don't know what, on Purpo&s;e to fill the Girl with Notions that don't be|long to her, in order to make her proud and &s;aucy; and then to in&s;pire her with In&s;olence to me, runs on with Suppo&s;itions of what Harm I might have done her, had the Book brui&s;ed her Face, or Eyes, and &s;o forth: As if our Daughters Eyes were not our own Eyes, their brazen Faces our brazen Faces; at lea&s;t till we can find &s;omebody to take them, and all the re&s;t of their Trumpery, off of our Hands. &mdash; Saucy Baggages! who have neither Souls nor Sen&s;es, but what they have borrowed from us; and who&s;e very Bones, and the Skin that covers them, &s;o much their Pride and their Ornament, are &s;o many Parts of our own undervalued Skin and Bones; and ours only are more wrinkled, by taking Pains to make theirs &s;mooth.</P>
<P>Nay, this fine Lady of yours, this Paragon of Meekne&s;s and Humility, in &s;o many Words, bids me, or tells my own Daughter to bid me, which is wor&s;e, never to take a Book in my Hands again, if I won't make a better U&s;e of it: &mdash;And yet, what better U&s;e can an offended Father make of the be&s;t Books, than to correct a rebellious Child with them, and oblige a &s;aucy Daughter to jump into her Duty all at once?</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="135">Then, pray, Sir, do you allow your Lady to beg Pre&s;ents from Gentlemen? &mdash; This is a tender Point to touch upon: But you &s;hall know all, I am re|&s;olv'd.&mdash;For here &s;he &s;ends to de&s;ire me to make her a Pre&s;ent of this very Book, and promi&s;es to &s;end me another as good.</P>
<P>Come, come, Sir, the&s;e are no je&s;ting Matters; for, is it not a &s;ad thing to think, that Ladies, let them be young or old, well-marry'd or ill-marry'd, cannot live without Intrigue? And here, if I were not a very hone&s;t Man, and your Friend, and <HI>re&s;olv'd</HI> to be a virtuous Man too, in &s;pite of Temptation, one does not know what might be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Corre&s;pondence as is here begun, or rather <HI>de&s;ired</HI> to be begun; for I have too much <HI>Honour</HI> to give into it, for your &s;ake, and I hope you'll think your&s;elf much oblig'd to me. &mdash; I know the Time that I have improv'd a more my&s;terious Hint than this, into all that I had a Mind to make of it. And it may be very happy for you, Neighbour, that I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and <HI>will</HI> be virtuous, let the Temptation be from whom it will: For the fine&s;t Lady in the World is nothing to me now &mdash; in this my Reformed State.</P>
<P>But this is not all: Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> goes on to reflect upon me for making her blu&s;h formerly, and &s;aying Things before my Daughters, that, truly, I ought to be a&s;hamed to &s;ay; and then avows Malice and Re|venge, and all that. Why, Sir, why, Neighbour, are the&s;e Things to be borne? &mdash; Do you allow your Lady to &s;et up for a general Corrector of every body's Morals but your own? Do you allow her to con|demn the only In&s;tances of Wit that remain to this Generation, that dear polite <HI>Double Entendre</HI>&punc; which keeps alive the Attention, and quickens the Appre|hen&s;ion of the be&s;t Companies in the World, and is the Salt, the Sauce, which gives a Poignancy to all our genteeler Entertainments?</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="136">Very fine, truly! that more than half the World &s;hall be &s;hut out of Society, &s;hall be precluded their Share of Conver&s;ation among the Gay and Polite of both Sexes, were your Lady to have her Will! Let her fir&s;t find People that can &s;upport a Conver&s;ation with Wit and good Sen&s;e like her own, and then &s;omething might be &s;aid: But, till then, I po&s;itively &s;ay, and will &s;wear upon Occa&s;ion, that <HI>Double En|tendre</HI> &s;hall not be bani&s;hed from our Tables; and where this won't rai&s;e a Blu&s;h, or create a Laugh, we will be at Liberty, if we plea&s;e, for all Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> and her new-fangled Notions, to force the one and the other by &s;till plainer Hints, and let her help her|&s;elf how &s;he can.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you find my Complaints are of a high Nature, regarding the Quiet of a Family, the Duty of a Child to a Parent, the Advances of a married Lady to a Gentleman who is re&s;olv'd to be virtuous, and the Freedom of Conver&s;ation; in all which Points your Lady has greatly offended; and I in&s;i&s;t upon Satisfaction from you, or &s;uch a Correction of the fair Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, as is in your Power to inflict, and which may prevent wor&s;e Con&s;equences, from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII. From Mr. <HI>B.</HI> In An&s;wer to the preceding.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Dear Sir</HI> Simon,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot but believe, that I was much &s;urpri&s;ed at your Letter, complaining of the Behaviour of my Wife. I could no more have expected &s;uch a Complaint from &s;uch a
<PB N="132" REF="137">
Gentleman, than I could, that <HI>&s;he</HI> would have de|&s;erved it: And I am very &s;orry on <HI>both</HI> Accounts. I have talked to her in &s;uch a Manner, that, I dare &s;ay, &s;he will never give you like Cau&s;e to appeal to me.</P>
<P>It happened, that the Criminal her&s;elf received your Letter from her Servant, and brought it to me in my Clo&s;et, and, making her Honours, (for I can't &s;ay but &s;he is very obliging to me, tho' &s;he takes &s;uch &s;aucy Freedoms with my Friends) away &s;he tripp'd; and I, inquiring for her, when, with Surprize, as you may believe, I had read your Charge, found &s;he was gone to vi&s;it a poor &s;ick Neighbour, of which indeed &s;he had before appris'd me, becau&s;e &s;he took the Cha|riot; but I had forgot it in my Wrath.</P>
<P>'Twas well for her, that &s;he was not in the Way; perhaps I &s;hould have taken more &s;evere Methods with her in my fir&s;t Emotions; and I long'd for her Return: And there is another <HI>Well-for-her</HI> too in her Ca&s;e; for one would be loth to &s;poil a Son and Heir, you know, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> before we &s;ee whether the little Varlet may de&s;erve one's Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e Things, that you may ob&s;erve, it was not owing to any Regard for the Offender her|&s;elf, that I did not puni&s;h her as much as injur'd Friend&s;hip requir'd at my Hands.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in &s;he came, with that &s;weet Compo&s;ure in her Face which re&s;ults from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing <HI>generally</HI> ju&s;t and generous Things; altho' in this In|&s;tance &s;he has &s;o egregiou&s;ly err'd, that it behoves me (as well in Ju&s;tice to my Friend, as Policy to my&s;elf; for who knows whither fir&s;t Faults may lead, if not checked in time?) to nip &s;uch Boldne&s;s in the Bud. And indeed the Moment I beheld the Charmer of my Heart, (for I do love her too well, that's certain) all my Anger was di&s;arm'd; and had the Offence re|garded <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I mu&s;t have forgiven her, in &s;pite of
<PB N="133" REF="138">
all my meditated Wrath. But it behov'd me in a <HI>Friend</HI>'s Ca&s;e not to be &s;oon &s;ubdu'd by a too partial Fondne&s;s: I re&s;umed therefore that Sternne&s;s and Di&s;plea&s;ure which her Entrance had almo&s;t di&s;&s;ipated. I took her Hand: Her charming Eye (you know what an Eye &s;he has, Sir <HI>Simon</HI>) quivered at my over-clouded A&s;pect, and her Lips, half-drawn to a Smile, trembled with Apprehen&s;ion of a Countenance &s;o changed from what &s;he left it.</P>
<P>And then, all &s;tiff and &s;tately as I could look, did I acco&s;t her: Come along with me, <HI>Pamela,</HI> to my Clo&s;et. I want to talk with you.</P>
<P>Dear Sir! good Sir! what's the Matter? what have I done?</P>
<P>We entered. I &s;at down, &s;till holding her un&s;teady Hand, and her Pul&s;e fluttering under my Finger, like a dying Bird.</P>
<P>'Tis <HI>well,</HI> &s;aid I, 'tis <HI>well,</HI> your pre&s;ent Condition pleads for you; and I mu&s;t not carry what I have to &s;ay too far, for Con&s;iderations le&s;s in your Favour, than for one un&s;een: But I have great Complaints again&s;t you.</P>
<P>Again&s;t me, Sir! &mdash; What have I done? Let me know, dear good Sir! looking round, with her half-affrighted Eyes, this way and that, on the Books, and Pictures, and on me, by Turns.</P>
<P>You &s;hall know &s;oon, &s;aid I, the Crime you have been guilty of.</P>
<P>Pray let me, Sir! &mdash; This Clo&s;et, I hoped, would not be a <HI>&s;econd</HI> Time Witne&s;s to the Flutter you put me in.</P>
<P><HI>There</HI> hangs a Tale, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> that I am not very fond of relating, &s;ince it gave Beginning to the Triumphs of this <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 102.</NOTE> little Sorcere&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="139">I &s;till held one Hand, and &s;he &s;tood before me, as Criminals ought to do before their Judge; but &s;aid, I &s;ee, Sir, &s;ure I do, or what will el&s;e become of me! le&s;s Severity in your Eyes than you affect to put on in your Countenance. Dear Sir, let me know my Fault! I will repent, acknowlege and amend: Let me <HI>but</HI> know it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t have great Pre&s;ence of Mind, <HI>Pamela,</HI> reply'd I, &s;uch is the Nature of your Fault, if you can look me in the Face, when I tell it you.</P>
<P>Then let me, &s;aid the irre&s;i&s;tible Charmer, hiding her Face in my Bo&s;om, and putting her other Arm about my Neck; let me thus, my Mr. <HI>B.</HI> hide this guilty Face, while I hear my Fault told; and I will not &s;eek to extenuate it, but by my Tears, and my Penitence.</P>
<P>I could hardly hold out. What infatuating Crea|tures are the&s;e Women, when they can think it thus worth their while to &s;ooth and calm the Tumults of an angry Heart! When, in&s;tead of <HI>&s;cornful</HI> Looks darted in Return for <HI>angry</HI> ones, Words of <HI>Defiance</HI> for Words of <HI>Peevi&s;hne&s;s,</HI> per&s;i&s;ting to defend <HI>one</HI> Error by <HI>another,</HI> and returning <HI>vehement Wrath</HI> for <HI>&s;light Indignation,</HI> and all the ho&s;tile Provocations of the Marriage Warfare; they can thus hide their dear Faces in our Bo&s;oms, and wi&s;h but to <HI>know</HI> their Faults, to <HI>amend</HI> them!</P>
<P>I could hardly, I &s;ay, re&s;i&s;t the &s;weet Girl's Behavi|our; nay, I believe I did, unawares to my&s;elf, and in Defiance of my re&s;olv'd Di&s;plea&s;ure, pre&s;s her Fore|head with my Lips, as the re&s;t of her Face was hid on my Brea&s;t: But, con&s;idering it was the Cau&s;e of my <HI>Friend</HI> that I was to a&s;&s;ert, my <HI>injured</HI> Friend, wounded and in&s;ulted, in &s;o various a Manner, by the fair Offender, thus haughtily &s;poke I to the trem|bling Mi&s;chief, in a Pomp of Style theatrically tra|gick:</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="140">I will not, too inadvertent and undi&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Pamela,</HI> keep you long in Su&s;pen&s;e, for the &s;ake of a Circum&s;tance, that, on this Occa&s;ion, ought to give you as much Joy, as it has, till now, given me&mdash; Since it becomes an Advocate in your Fa|vour, when otherwi&s;e you might expect a very &s;evere Treatment.

<P>She rai&s;ed her Head at once on this: Thank Heav'n! &s;aid &s;he, it is no wor&s;e!&mdash;I was at my Wits End almo&s;t, in Apprehen&s;ion: But I know how this mu&s;t be.&mdash;Dear Sir, How could you frighten me &s;o.&mdash;I know how all this is!&mdash;I can now look you in the Face, and hear all that Sir <HI>Simon</HI> can charge me with: For I am &s;ure, I have not &s;o affronted him, as to make him angry indeed. And truly, (ran &s;he on, &s;ecure of Pardon, as &s;he &s;eem'd to think) I &s;hould re&s;pect Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> not only as your Friend, but on his own Account, if he was not &s;o &s;ad a Rake at a Time of Life&mdash;</P>
<P>Then I interrupted her, you mu&s;t needs think, Sir <HI>Simon</HI>; for how could I bear to hear my wor|thy Friend &s;o freely treated?&mdash;How now, <HI>Pamela!</HI> &s;aid I; and is it thus, by <HI>repeating</HI> your Fault, that you <HI>atone</HI> for it? Do you think I can bear to hear my Friend &s;o freely treated?</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid &s;he, I do re&s;pect Sir <HI>Simon</HI> very much, as your <HI>Friend,</HI> permit me to repeat; but
<PB N="136" REF="141">
cannot for his wilful Failings. Would it not be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to approve of faulty Conver&s;ation, if one can hear it, and not di&s;courage it, when the Oc|ca&s;ion comes in &s;o pat? &mdash;And, indeed, I was glad of an Opportunity, continued &s;he, to give him a little Rub; I mu&s;t needs own it: But if it di&s;plea&s;es you, or has made him angry in Earne&s;t, I am &s;orry for it, and will be le&s;s bold for the future.</P>
<P>Read then, &s;aid I, the heavy Charge, and I'll re|turn in&s;tantly to hear your An&s;wer to it. So I went from her, for a few Minutes.</P>
<P>But, would you believe it, Sir <HI>Simon?</HI> &s;he &s;eem'd, on my Return, very little concerned at your ju&s;t Complaints.&mdash;What &s;elf-ju&s;tifying Minds have the meeke&s;t of the&s;e Women!&mdash;In&s;tead of finding her in repentant Tears, as one might have expected, &s;he took your angry Letter for a jocular one, and I had great Difficulty to convince her of the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>her</HI> Fault, or the Reality of <HI>your</HI> Anger. Upon which, being determin'd to have Ju&s;tice done to my Friend, and a due Sen&s;e of her own great Error im|pre&s;s'd upon her, I began thus:</P>
<P><HI>Pamela, Pamela,</HI> take heed, that you do not &s;uffer the Purity of your own Mind, in Breach of your Cha|rity, to make you too rigorous a Cen&s;urer of other Peoples Actions: Don't be &s;o puff'd up with your own Perfections, as to imagine, that, becau&s;e other Per&s;ons allow them&s;elves Liberties you cannot take, <HI>therefore</HI> they mu&s;t be wicked. Sir <HI>Simon</HI> is a Gen|tleman who indulges him&s;elf in a plea&s;ant Vein, and, I believe, as well as you, <HI>has been</HI> a great Rake and Libertine (you'll excu&s;e me, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> becau&s;e I am taking your Part): But what then? You &s;ee it is all over with him now: You &s;ee, he &s;ays him&s;elf, that he <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> and therefore he <HI>will,</HI> be virtuous: And is a Man for ever to hear of the Faults of his Youth, when he him&s;elf is &s;o willing to forget them?</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="142">Ah! but, Sir, Sir, &s;aid the bold Slut, can you &s;ay he is <HI>willing</HI> to forget them?&mdash;Does he not repine here in this very Letter, that he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> for&s;ake them; and does he not plainly cheri&s;h the <HI>Inclination,</HI> when he owns&mdash;She he&s;itated&mdash;Owns what?&mdash;You know what I mean, Sir; and I need not &s;peak it: And can there well be a more cen&s;urable Character?&mdash;Then, dear Sir, <HI>before</HI> his Maiden Daughters! <HI>before</HI> his virtuous Lady! <HI>before</HI> Any-body!&mdash;What a &s;ad thing is this, at a Time of Life, which &s;hould afford a better Example!</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, continu'd the bold Prattler, (taking Advantage of a Silence that was more owing to Di&s;|plea&s;ure than Approbation) let me, for I would not be <HI>cen&s;orious,</HI> (No, not &s;he! In the very Act of Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s to &s;ay this! let me) offer but one thing: Don't you think, Sir <HI>Simon</HI> him&s;elf would be loth to be thought a reform'd Gentleman? Don't you &s;ee the Delight he takes, when he &s;peaks of his former Pranks, as if he was &s;orry he could not play them over again? See but how he &s;impers, and <HI>injoys,</HI> as one may &s;ay, the Relations of his own raki&s;h Actions, when he tells a bad Story!&mdash;And have you not &s;een how often he has been forced to take his Handker|chief to wipe the Out&s;ide of his Mouth, tho' the In&s;ide wanted it mo&s;t, when he has wounded a Lady's Ears, and turn'd, as it were, his own faulty Heart in&s;ide out?&mdash;Indeed, Sir, I am afraid, &s;o bad in this way is your worthy Neighbour, that he would ac|count it a Di&s;grace to him to be thought reform'd: And how then can I abu&s;e the Gentleman, by repre|&s;enting him in a Light in which he loves to be con|&s;idered?</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, were this the Ca&s;e, (for I profe&s;s, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> I was at a grievous Lo&s;s to defend you) for you to write all the&s;e free things again&s;t a Father to his Daughter, is that right, <HI>Pamela?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="143">O Sir! the <HI>good</HI> Gentleman him&s;elf has taken care, that &s;uch a Character as I pre&s;um'd to draw to Mi&s;s of her Papa, was no &s;trange one to her. You have &s;een your&s;elf, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> whenever his arch Leers, and the humourous Attitude in which he puts him&s;elf on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, have taught us to expect &s;ome &s;hocking Story, how his Lady and Daughters (us'd to him, as they are) have &s;uffer'd in their Apprehen|&s;ions of what he would &s;ay, before he &s;poke it: How, particularly, dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> has look'd at me with Concern, de&s;irous, as it were, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave her Papa from the Cen&s;ure, which his faulty Expre&s;&s;ions mu&s;t naturally bring upon him. And, dear Sir, is it not a &s;ad thing for a young Lady, who loves and honours her Papa, to ob&s;erve that he is di&s;crediting him&s;elf, and <HI>wants</HI> the Example he ought to <HI>give?</HI> And, pardon me, Sir, for &s;miling on &s;o &s;erious an Occa&s;ion, continu'd &s;he; but is it not a fine Sight, do you think, to &s;ee a Gentleman, as we have more than once &s;een Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> when he has thought proper to read a Pa&s;&s;age or &s;o, in &s;ome bad Book, pulling off <HI>his Spectacles,</HI> to talk filthily? Methinks, I &s;ee him now, added the bold Slut, &s;plitting his arch Face, with a broad Laugh, &s;hewing a Mouth, with hardly a Tooth in it, while he is making ob&s;cene Remarks upon what he has read.&mdash;</P>
<P>And then the dear Saucyface laugh'd out, to bear <HI>me</HI> Company; for I could not, for the Soul of me, avoid laughing heartily at the Figure &s;he brought to my Mind, which I have &s;een my old Friend make, on two or three Occa&s;ions of this &s;ort, with his di&s;|mounted Spectacles, his arch Mouth, and Gums of &s;hining Jet, &s;ucceeding tho&s;e of poli&s;h'd Ivory, of which he often boa&s;ts, as one Ornament of his youthful Days.&mdash;And I the rather in my Heart, Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> gave you up, becau&s;e, when I was a &s;ad Fel|low, it was always a Maxim with me, to endeavour
<PB N="139" REF="144">
to touch a Lady's Heart without wounding her Ears. And, indeed, I found my Account &s;ometimes in ob|&s;erving it.</P>
<P>But, re&s;uming my Gravity, Hu&s;&s;y, &s;aid I, do you think I will have my old Friend thus made the Sub|ject of your Ridicule?&mdash;Suppo&s;e a Challenge &s;hould have en&s;u'd between us on your Account&mdash;What might have been the I&s;&s;ue of it? To &s;ee an old Gen|tleman, &s;tumping, as he &s;ays, on Crutches, to fight a Duel in Defence of his wounded Honour! A pretty Sight this would have afforded, would it not? And what (had any one met him on the Way) could he have &s;aid he was going to do? Don't you con&s;i|der, that a Man is an&s;werable for the Faults of his Wife? And, if my Fondne&s;s for you would have made me deny doing Ju&s;tice to my Friend, and, on the contrary, to re&s;olve in your behalf to give him a Meeting, and he had flung his Crutch at my Head, as he did the Book at his Daughter's, what might have been the Con&s;equence, think you?</P>
<P>Very bad, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, to be &s;ure; I &s;ee that and am &s;orry for it: For had you carry'd off Sir <HI>Simon</HI>'s Crutch as a Trophy, the poor Gentleman mu&s;t have lain &s;ighing and groaning, like a wounded Soldier in the Field of Battle, till another had been brought him, to have &s;tump'd home with.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> I have brought this Matter to an I&s;&s;ue, that will, I hope, make all ea&s;y: And that is this&mdash;Mi&s;s <HI>Polly,</HI> and my <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;hall both be puni&s;h'd as they de&s;erve, if it be not your own Fault. I am told, that the Sins of your Youth don't fit &s;o heavily upon your Limbs, as they do in your Imagination; and I believe Change of Air, and the Gratification of your Revenge, a fine Help to &s;uch lively Spirits as yours! will &s;et you up.

<P>HARK ye me, 'Squire <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;A Word in your Ear!&mdash;I like neither you, nor your Wife, to be plain with you, well enough to tru&s;t my <HI>Polly</HI> with you.

<P>But here's War declar'd again&s;t my poor Gums, it &s;eems. Well, I will never open my Mouth before your Lady, as long as I live, if I can help it. I have for the&s;e Ten Years avoided to put on my Cravat; and for what Rea&s;on, do you think?&mdash;Why, becau&s;e I could not bear to &s;ee what Ruins a few Years have made in a Vi&s;age, that us'd to in&s;pire Love and Terror as it pleas'd.&mdash;And here your&mdash;What-&s;hall-I-call-her of a Wife, with all the In&s;olence of Youth

and Beauty on her Side, follows me with a Gla&s;s, and would make me look in it, whether I will or not. I'm a plaguy good-humour'd old Fellow&mdash;if I <HI>am</HI> an old Fellow&mdash;or I &s;hould not bear the In&s;ults con|tain'd in your Letter. Between you and your Lady, you make a wretched Figure of me, that's certain&mdash; And yet, 'tis <HI>taking my Part,</HI> with a P&mdash;x to <HI>you,</HI> Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I would have &s;aid; but on your Lady's Ac|count&mdash;You &s;ee I have as much more Charity than her, as &s;he has Purity than me; or I &s;hould not have put in that Saving Clau&s;e in her Behalf.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;mounted Spectacles, arch Mouth, Gums of &s;hining Jet,</HI> and &s;uch-like fine De&s;criptions, are the&s;e yours, or your Lady's? I'd be glad to know that, Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Well but, What a D&mdash;l mu&s;t a Man do?&mdash;I'd be glad at any Rate to &s;tand in your Lady's Graces, that I would: Nor would I be the la&s;t Rake and Libertine unreform'd by her Example, which I &s;up|po&s;e will make Virtue the Fa&s;hion, if &s;he goes on at the Rate &s;he does. But here I have been us'd to cut a Joke, and to&s;s the Squib about; and, as far as I know, it has help'd to keep me alive in the mid&s;t of Pains and Aches, and with two Women-grown Girls, and the re&s;t of the Mortifications that will at|tend on <HI>advanced Years</HI>; for I won't (hang me if I will) give it up as ab&s;olute <HI>Old-age!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I love, I own it, to make a pretty Woman blu&s;h; it is double-damasking a fine Ro&s;e, as it were; and till I &s;aw your&mdash;[Do, let me call her &s;ome free Name or other!

<P>But now, it &s;eems, I mu&s;t leave all this off, or I mu&s;t be mortify'd with a Looking-gla&s;s held before me, and every Wrinkle mu&s;t be made as con&s;picuous as a Cable-rope.&mdash;And what, pray, is to &s;ucceed to this Reformation?&mdash;I can neither fa&s;t nor pray, I doubt.&mdash;And be&s;ides, if my Stomach and my Je&s;t depart from me, farewel, Sir <HI>Simon Darnford!</HI></P>
<P>But cannot I pa&s;s as one nece&s;&s;ary Character, do you think; as a Foil (as by-the-bye &s;ome of your own Actions have been to your Lady's Virtue) to &s;et off &s;ome more edifying Example, where Variety of Characters make up a Fea&s;t in Conver&s;ation?</P>

It will be very cruel, if you won't.</P>
<P>Well but, after all, I believe I might have tru&s;ted you with my Daughter, under your Lady's Eye, Rake as you have been your&s;elf. And Fame &s;ays wrong, if you have not been for your Time, a bolder Sinner than ever I was, (with your Maxim of touching Ladies Hearts, without wounding their Ears, which made &s;urer Work with them, that was all)

<P>All that I will attempt to do, therefore, &s;hall be, to &s;hew &s;uch a re&s;pectful Obligingne&s;s to my Lady, as &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with the Condition to which I am rai&s;ed; that &s;o her Lady&s;hip may not have Rea|&s;on to reproach me of Pride in my Exaltation, nor her dear Brother to rebuke me for Meanne&s;s in con|de&s;cending: And, as to my Family Management, I am the le&s;s afraid of In&s;pection, becau&s;e by the natural Bya&s;s of my own Mind, I ble&s;s God, I am above dark Re&s;erves, and have not one &s;elfi&s;h or &s;or|did View, that &s;hould make me wi&s;h to avoid the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing Eye.</P>
<P>I have begun a Corre&s;pondence with Mi&s;s <HI>Darn|ford,</HI> a young Lady of uncommon Merit. But you know her Character from my former Writings. She is very &s;olicitous to hear of every thing that concerns
<PB N="145" REF="150">
me, and particularly how Lady <HI>Davers</HI> and I agree together. I loved her from the Moment I &s;aw her fir&s;t; for &s;he has the lea&s;t Pride, and the mo&s;t Bene|volence and &s;olid Thought, I ever knew in a young Lady, and knows not what it is to envy any one. I &s;hall write to her often: And as I &s;hall have &s;o many Avocations be&s;ides to fill up my Time, I know you will excu&s;e me, if I procure from Mi&s;s, as I hope to do, the Return of my Letters to her, for your Peru&s;al, and the Entertainment of your Lei&s;ure Hours. This will give you, from time to time, the Accounts you de&s;ire of all that happens here. But as to what relates to our own Particulars, I beg you will never &s;pare writing, as I &s;hall not an&s;wering; for it is one of my greate&s;t Delights, that I have &s;uch dear, &s;uch worthy Parents, (as, I hope in God, I long &s;hall) to ble&s;s me, and to corre&s;pond with me.</P>
<P>The Papers I &s;end herewith will afford you &s;ome Diver&s;ion; particularly, tho&s;e relating to Sir <HI>Simon Darnford</HI>; and I mu&s;t de&s;ire, that when you have peru&s;ed them, (as well as what I &s;hall &s;end for the future) you will return them to me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> gave me great Plea&s;ure, on his la&s;t Return from you, in his Account of your Health, and the Satisfaction you take in your happy Lot; and I mu&s;t recite to you a brief Conver&s;ation, on this Occa&s;ion, that, I dare &s;ay, will plea&s;e you as much as it did me.</P>
<P>After he had been adju&s;ting &s;ome Affairs with his dear Principal, which took them up two Hours, my be&s;t Beloved &s;ent for me.&mdash;My Dear, &s;aid he, take|ing my Hand, and &s;eating me down by him, and making the good old Gentleman &s;it down, (for he will always ri&s;e at my Approach) Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> and I have &s;ettled in two Hours &s;ome Accounts, which would have taken up as many Months with &s;ome Per|&s;ons. But never was an exacter or more methodical
<PB N="146" REF="151">
Accomptant than Mr. <HI>Longman:</HI> He gives me, (greatly to my Satisfaction, becau&s;e I know it will delight you) an Account of the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Concern, and of the Plea&s;ure your Father and Mother take in it.&mdash; Now, my Charmer, &s;aid he, I &s;ee your &s;weet Eyes begin to gli&s;ten:&mdash;O how this Subject rai&s;es your whole Soul to the Windows of it! &mdash; Never was &s;o dutiful a Daughter, Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and never did Parents better de&s;erve a Daughter's Duty!</P>
<P>I endeavour'd before Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> to rein in a Gratitude, that my throbbing Heart confe&s;&s;ed thro' my Handkerchief, as I could perceive: But the good old Gentleman could not hinder his from &s;hewiug it|&s;elf at his worthy Eyes, to &s;ee how much I was fa|vour'd &mdash; <HI>oppre&s;s'd,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay, with the deare&s;t Gentleman's tender Goodne&s;s to me, and kind Ex|pre&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir, excu&s;e me, Madam, &s;aid he, wiping his Cheeks: My Delight to &s;ee &s;uch Merit &s;o ju&s;tly rewarded, will not be contained, I think.&mdash; And &s;o he got up, and walked to the Window.</P>
<P>Well, good Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> &s;aid I, as he returned towards us, you give me the Plea&s;ure to know, that my Father and Mother are well; and happy then they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be, in a Goodne&s;s and Bounty, that I, and many more, rejoice in.</P>
<P>Well and happy, Madam! &mdash; Ay that they are in|deed! And a worthier Couple never lived, I a&s;&s;ure you. Mo&s;t nobly do they go on, in the Farm. Your Honour's one of the happie&s;t Gentlemen in the World. All the Good you do, returns upon you in a Trice. It may well be &s;aid. <HI>You ca&s;t your Bread upon the Waters</HI>; for it pre&s;ently comes to you again, richer and heavier than when you threw it in. All the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Tenants, Madam, are hugely delighted with their good Steward: Every thing pro|&s;pers under his Management: The Gentry love both

him and my Dame; and the poor People adore them. Indeed they do a Pow'r of Good, in vi&s;iting their poor Neighbours, and giving them Cordials, and &s;uch-like; in&s;omuch that Colicks, Agues, and twenty Di&s;tempers, nipp'd in the Bud, fly before them. So that I reckon the Doctors will &s;oon be the only Enemies they have in the World: For, in a while, there will be no Occa&s;ion for one within ten Miles of their Habitation.</P>
<P>In this manner ran on Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> to my inex|pre&s;&s;ible Delight, you may believe; and when he withdrew, 'Tis an hone&s;t Soul, &s;aid my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I love him for his re&s;pectful Love to my Angel, and his Value for the worthy Pair. Very glad I am, that every thing an&s;wers <HI>their</HI> Wi&s;hes. May they long live, and be happy!</P>
<P>The dear Gentleman makes me &s;pring to his Arms, whenever he touches this String: For he &s;peaks al|ways thus generou&s;ly and kindly of you; and is glad to hear, he &s;ays, that you don't live only to your|&s;elves: And now-and-then adds, That your Prudence and mine do more Credit to his Choice, than might have been done him by an Alliance with the fir&s;t Quality: Since every Mouth, he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, is full of our Merits. How plea&s;ing, how tran&s;port|ing rather, my dear Parents, mu&s;t this Goodne&s;s be to your happy Daughter! And how could I forbear repeating the&s;e kind Things to you, that you may &s;ee how well every thing is taken that you do?</P>
<P>When the expected Vi&s;it from Lord and Lady <HI>Davers</HI> is over, the approaching Winter will carry us to <HI>London</HI>; and as I &s;hall then be nearer to you, we may more frequently hear from one another, which, to be &s;ure, will be a great Heightening to my Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>But I have &s;uch an Account given me of the Im|moralities to which Per&s;ons are expo&s;ed there, along
<PB N="148" REF="153">
with the publick Diver&s;ions, that it takes off a little from the Satisfaction I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have in the Thought of going thither.

<P>This makes me very thoughtful at times. But God, I hope, will pre&s;erve our deare&s;t Benefactor, and continue to me his Affection, and then I &s;hall be always happy; e&s;pecially while your Healths and Felicity confirm and crown the Delights of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT may not be improper to mention our&s;elves, what the Nature of the Kindne&s;&s;es is which we confer on our poor Neighbours, and the labouring People, le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;urmi&s;ed by any body, that we are lavi&s;hing away Wealth that is not our own. Not that we fear either your honoured Husband or you will &s;u&s;pect any &s;uch Matter, or that the worthy Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> would in&s;inuate as much; for he &s;aw what we did, and was highly plea&s;ed with it, and &s;aid he would make &s;uch a Report of it as you write he did. What we do is in &s;mall Things, tho' the Good we hope from them is not &s;mall perhaps: And if a very di&s;tre&s;sful Ca&s;e &s;hould happen among our poor Neighbours, that would require any thing con|&s;iderable, and the Objects be de&s;erving, we would acquaint you with it, and leave it to you to do as God &s;hall direct you.</P>
<P>But this, indeed, we have done, and continue to do: We have furni&s;hed our&s;elves with &s;imple Wa|ters
<PB N="149" REF="154">
and Cordials of &s;everal Sorts; and when in a hot &s;ultry Day, I &s;ee poor labouring Creatures ready to faint and drop down, if they are only fatigued, I order them a Mouthful of Bread or &s;o, and a Cup of good Ale or Beer, and this makes them go about their Bu&s;ine&s;s with new Spirits; and when they ble&s;s me for it, I tell them they mu&s;t ble&s;s the good 'Squire, from who&s;e Bounty, next to God, it all pro|ceeds. If any are ill, I give them a Cordial; and we have been the Means of &s;etting up &s;everal poor Creatures who have labour'd under Colicky and Agui&s;h Di&s;orders, or have been taken with &s;light Stomach Ailments. And nothing is lo&s;t by it, my dear Child; for poor People have as grateful Souls as any body; and it would delight your dear Heart to &s;ee how many drooping Spirits we have rai&s;ed, and how, in an Hour or two, &s;ome of them, after a little cordial Refre&s;hment, from langui&s;hing under an Hedge, or behind a Hay-&s;tack, have skipped about, as nimble as Deer, whi&s;tling and &s;inging, and pur&s;u|ing with Alacrity their &s;everal Imployments; and in&s;tead of cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, as is the Manner of &s;ome wicked Wretches, nothing but Ble&s;&s;ings and Prai&s;es poured out of their glad Hearts upon his Honour and you; calling me their Father and Friend, and telling me, they will live and die for me, and my Wife; and that we &s;hall never want an indu&s;tri|ous Servant to do his Honour's Bu&s;ine&s;s, or to cul|tivate the Farm I am ble&s;&s;ed in. And in like &s;ort, we communicate to our &s;ick or wanting Neighbours, even altho' they be not Tenants to the E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Come, my dear Child, you are happy, very happy, to be &s;ure you are; and, if it <HI>can</HI> be, may you be yet happier and happier! But &s;till I verily think you cannot be more happy than your Father and Mother, except in this one thing, That all <HI>our</HI> Happine&s;s, un|der God, proceeds from you; and, as other Parents
<PB N="150" REF="155">
ble&s;s their Children with Plenty and Benefits, you have ble&s;s'd your Parents (or your honoured Husband rather for your &s;ake) with all the good Things this World can afford.</P>
<P>The Papers you &s;end us are the Joy of our Lei&s;ure Hours; and you are kind, beyond all Expre&s;&s;ion, in taking care to oblige us with them. We know how your Time is taken up, and ought to be very well contented, if but now-and-then you let us hear of your Health and Welfare. But it is not enough with &s;uch a good Daughter, that you have made our Lives <HI>comfortable,</HI> but you will make them <HI>joyful</HI> too, by communicating to us all that befals you: And then you write &s;o piou&s;ly, and with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of God's Goodne&s;s to you, and intermix &s;uch good Reflections in your Writings, that, whether it be our partial Love or not, I cannot tell, but, truly, we think no|body comes up to you: And you make our Hearts and our Eyes &s;o often overflow, as we read, that we join Hand in Hand together, and I &s;ay to her, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, and ble&s;&s;ed be you, my Dear; and &s;he in the &s;ame Breath, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, and you, my Love&mdash; For &s;uch a Daughter, &s;ays the one &mdash; For &s;uch a Daughter, &s;ays the other &mdash;And &s;he has your own &s;weet Temper, cry I &mdash;And &s;he has your own hone&s;t Heart, cries &s;he: And &s;o we go on, ble&s;&s;ing God, and ble&s;&s;ing you, and ble&s;&s;ing your Spou&s;e, and ble&s;&s;ing our&s;elves! &mdash; Is any Happine&s;s like our Happine&s;s, my dear Daughter!</P>
<P>Really and indeed, we are &s;o inraptur'd with your Writings, that when our Spirits flag, thro' the Infir|mity of Years, that have begun to take hold of us, we have recour&s;e to &s;ome of your Papers: Come, my Dear, cry I, what &s;ay you to a Banquet now? &mdash; She knows what I mean. With all my Heart, &s;ays &s;he. &mdash; So I read, altho' it be on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> &s;o good are your Letters; and, you mu&s;t know, I have Copies
<PB N="151" REF="156">
of a many of them: And after a little while, we are as much alive and brisk, as if we had had no Flag|ging at all, and return to the Duties of the Day with double Delight.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider then, my dear Child, what Joy your Writings give us: And yet we are afraid of oppre&s;|&s;ing you who have &s;o much to do of other Kinds; and we are heartily glad you have found out a way to &s;ave Trouble to your&s;elf, and rejoice us, and oblige &s;o worthy a young Lady as Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> all at one time. I never &s;hall forget her dear Goodne&s;s to me, and the Notice &s;he took of me at the Hall <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 107.</NOTE>, kindly pre&s;&s;ing my rough Hands with her fine Hands, and looking in my Face with <HI>&s;o</HI> much Kindne&s;s in her Eyes!&mdash;to be &s;ure I never &s;hall. &mdash; What good People, as well as bad, there are in high Stations!&mdash; Thank God there are; el&s;e our poor Child would have had a &s;ad Time of it too often, when &s;he was obliged to <HI>&s;tep out of her&s;elf,</HI> as once I heard you phra&s;e it, into Company you could not <HI>live with.</HI></P>
<P>Well, but how &s;hall I end? And yet, what &s;hall I &s;ay more? &mdash; Only, with my Prayers, that God will continue to you the Ble&s;&s;ings and Comforts you are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of! &mdash; And pray now, be not over|thoughtful about what may happen at <HI>London</HI>; for why &s;hould you let the Dread of future Evils le&s;&s;en your pre&s;ent Joys? There is no ab&s;olute Perfection in this Life, that's true; but one would make one's &s;elf as ea&s;y as one could. 'Tis Time enough to be troubled when Troubles come:&mdash;<HI>Sufficient unto the Day is the Evil thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Rejoice then, my dear Child, as you have often &s;aid you would, in your pre&s;ent Ble&s;&s;ings, and leave the Event of Things to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all Events. And what have <HI>you</HI> to do, but rejoice?
<PB N="152" REF="157">
<HI>You,</HI> who cannot &s;ee a Sun ri&s;e, but it is to ble&s;s you, and to rai&s;e up from their Beds Numbers to join in the Ble&s;&s;ing! <HI>You</HI> who can ble&s;s your high-born Friends, and your low-born Parents, and ob&s;cure Relations! who can ble&s;s the Rich by your Example, and the Poor by your Bounty; and ble&s;s be&s;ides &s;o good and &s;o brave a Husband! &mdash; O my dear Child, what, let me repeat it, have <HI>you</HI> to do, but rejoice?&mdash;<HI>For many Daughters have done wi&s;ely, but you have ex|celled them all.</HI></P>
<P>I will only add, that every thing the 'Squire or|der'd is ju&s;t upon the Point of being fini&s;hed. And when the good Time comes, that we &s;hall be again favoured with his Pre&s;ence and yours, what a &s;till greater Joy will this afford to the already over|flowing Hearts of</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mi&s;s</HI> Darnford,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Intere&s;t I take in every thing that concerns you, makes me very importunate to know how you approve the Gentleman, whom &s;ome of his be&s;t Friends and Well-wi&s;hers have recommended to your Favour. I hope he will de&s;erve your good Opinion, and then he mu&s;t excel mo&s;t of the un|married Gentlemen in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Your Papa, in his humourous Manner, mentions his large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Riches: But, indeed, were he as rich as <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> he &s;hould not have my Con&s;ent, if he has no <HI>greater</HI> Merit; tho' that is what the Ge|nerality of Parents look out for fir&s;t: And indeed an ea&s;y Fortune is &s;o far from being di&s;regardable, that, when attended with <HI>equal</HI> Merit, I think it ought to have a <HI>Preference</HI> given to it, &s;uppo&s;ing Affections
<PB N="153" REF="158">
di&s;ingaged. For 'tis certain, that a Gentleman or Lady may &s;tand as good a Chance for Happine&s;s in Mar|riage with a Per&s;on of Fortune, as with one who has not that Advantage; and notwith&s;tanding I had neither Riches nor De&s;cent to boa&s;t of, I mu&s;t be of Opinion with tho&s;e, who &s;ay, that they never knew any body de&s;pi&s;e either, that had them. But to permit Riches to be the <HI>principal</HI> Inducement, to the Ne|glect of &s;uperior Merit, that is the Fault which many a one &s;marts for, whether the Choice be their own, or impo&s;ed upon them by tho&s;e who have a Title to their Obedience.</P>
<P>Here is a &s;aucy Body, might &s;ome, who have not Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s kind Con&s;ideration for her Friend, be apt to &s;ay, who being thus meanly de&s;cended, neverthele&s;s pre&s;umes to give her Opinion, in the&s;e high Ca&s;es, unasked. But I have one thing, my dear Mi&s;s, to &s;ay; and that is, that I think my&s;elf &s;o in|tirely dive&s;ted of Partiality to my own Ca&s;e, that, as far as my Judgment &s;hall permit, I will never have that in View, when I am pre&s;uming to hint my Opi|nion of general Rules. For, mo&s;t &s;urely, the Ho|nours I have received, and the Deba&s;ement to which my be&s;t Friend has &s;ubjected him&s;elf, have, for their principal Excu&s;e, that the Gentleman was intirely inde|pendent, had no Que&s;tions to ask, and had a Fortune &s;ufficient to make him&s;elf, as well as the Per&s;on he cho&s;e, happy, tho' &s;he brought him nothing at all; and that he had, moreover, &s;uch a Character for good Sen&s;e, and Knowlege of the World, that nobody could impute to him any other Inducement, but that of a noble Re&s;olution to reward a Virtue he had &s;o fre|quently, and, I will &s;ay, &s;o wickedly, try'd, and could not &s;ubdue.</P>
<P>But why do I thus run on to Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> who&s;e partial Friend&s;hip attributes to me Merits I cannot claim? I will, therefore, quit this Subject, as a
<PB N="154" REF="159">
needle&s;s one to her, and proceed to what was prin|cipally in my View, when I began to write; and that is, to complain of your Papa, who has, let me &s;ay it, done his Endeavour to &s;et at Variance a Gen|tleman and his Wife.</P>
<P>I will not enter into the Particulars, becau&s;e the Appeal is to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and it would look like invading his Prerogative, to take it into my own Hands. But I can tell Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> that he is the only Gentleman, I hope, who, when a young Per&s;on of my Sex asked him to make her a Pre&s;ent of a Book, would put &s;uch a mi&s;chievous Turn as he has done upon it, to her Husband!&mdash;Indeed, from the <HI>Beginning,</HI> I had Rea|&s;on to call him a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 249.</NOTE> Tell-tale&mdash;But, no more of that&mdash;Yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, I had rather he &s;hould have flung this Book at <HI>my</HI> Head too, than to have made a &s;o much wor&s;e U&s;e of it. But I came off toler|ably, no Thanks to Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> however!&mdash;And <HI>but</HI> tolerably neither: For, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> kept me in Su&s;pen&s;e a good while, and put me in great Flutters, before he let me into the Matter.</P>
<P>But I was very much concerned, my dear Mi&s;s, at fir&s;t, till you gave a Rea&s;on I better liked after|wards, for Sir <HI>Simon</HI>'s denying your Company to me, after I had obtain'd the Favour of your Mamma's Con&s;ent, and you were kindly inclin'd your&s;elf to oblige me: And that was, that Sir <HI>Simon</HI> had a bad Opinion of the Honour of my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> For, as to that Part of his Doubt, which reflected Di&s;|honour upon his dear Daughter, it was all but the Effect of his &s;trange free Humour, on purpo&s;e to vex you.</P>
<P>That Gentleman mu&s;t be the mo&s;t abandon'd of Men, who would attempt any thing again&s;t the Vir|tue of a Lady intru&s;ted to his Protection: And I am
<PB N="155" REF="160">
grieved, methinks, that the dear Gentleman, who is the better Part of my&s;elf, and has, to his own De|ba&s;ement, acted &s;o honourably by me, &s;hould be thought capable of &s;o much Vilene&s;s. But forgive me, Mi&s;s; it is only Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> I dare &s;ay, who could think &s;o hardly of him: And I am in great Hope, for the Honour of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Age, (quite contrary to the A&s;per&s;ion, that every Age grows wor&s;e and wor&s;e) that the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> if it produc'd People ca|pable of &s;uch Attempts, was wickeder than this.</P>
<P>Bad as my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s De&s;igns and Attempts were upon me, I can, now I am &s;et above fearing them, and am inabled to reflect upon them with le&s;s Terror and Apprehen&s;ion, be earne&s;t, for his own dear &s;ake, to think him not, even <HI>then,</HI> the wor&s;t of Men, tho' bad enough in all Con&s;cience: For have we not heard of tho&s;e that have had no Remor&s;e or Compunction at all, and have actually executed all their vile Purpo&s;es, when a poor Crea|ture was in their Power?&mdash;Yet (indeed, after &s;ore Trials, that's true!) did not God turn his Heart? And altho' I was &s;till helple&s;s, and without any Friend in the World, and in the Hands of a poor vile Wo|man, who, to be &s;ure, was wor&s;e than he, provoking him to ruin me, and &s;o wholly in his Power, that I dur&s;t not di&s;obey him, whether he bid me come to him, or be gone from him, as he was plea&s;ed, or di&s;|plea&s;ed with me; yet, I &s;ay, for all this, did he not overcome his criminal Pa&s;&s;ion, and entertain an ho|nourable one, tho' to his poor Servant Girl; and brave the World, and the World's Cen&s;ures, and marry me?</P>
<P>And does not this &s;hew, that the Seeds of Honour were kept alive in his Heart, tho' choaked or kept from &s;prouting forth, for a Time, by the Weeds of Sen&s;uality, Pride, and youthful Impetuo&s;ity? And by cutting down the latter, have not the former
<PB N="156" REF="161">
taken Root, have they not &s;hot out, and, in their turn, <HI>kept down</HI> at lea&s;t, the depre&s;&s;ed Weeds? And who now lives more virtuou&s;ly than Mr. <HI>B.</HI>?</P>
<P>Let me tell you, my dear Mi&s;s, that I have not heard of many In&s;tances of Gentlemen, who, having de&s;igned vilely, have &s;topt &s;hort, and acted &s;o ho|nourably; and who continue to act &s;o nobly: And I have great Confidence, that he will, in time, be as pious, as he is now moral; for tho' he has a few bad No|tions, which he talks of now-and-then, as Polygamy, and &s;uch-like, which indeed give me a little &s;erious Thought &s;ometimes, becau&s;e a Man is too apt to practi&s;e what he has per&s;uaded him&s;elf to believe is no Crime; yet, I hope, they are owing more to the Liveline&s;s of his Wit, (a wild Quality, which does not always confine it&s;elf to proper Exerci&s;es) than to his Judgment. And if I can but &s;ee the fir&s;t three or four Months Re&s;idence over in that wicked <HI>Lon|don,</HI> (which, they &s;ay, is &s;o &s;educing a Place) without adding to my Apprehen&s;ions, how happy &s;hall I be!</P>
<P>So much, &s;lightly, have I thought proper to &s;ay in behalf of my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> For a good Wife can|not but hope for a &s;weeter and more elevated Com|panion&s;hip, (if her pre&s;umptuous Heart makes her look upward with Hope her&s;elf) than this tran&s;itory State can afford us. And what a &s;ad Ca&s;e is hers, who being as exemplary as human Frailty will per|mit her to be, looks forward upon the Partner of her adver&s;e and of her pro&s;perous E&s;tate, the Husband of her Bo&s;om, the Father of her Children, the Head of her Family, as a poor unhappy Soul, de|&s;tin'd to a &s;eparate and a mi&s;erable Exi&s;tence for ever!&mdash;O my dear Mi&s;s!&mdash;How can &s;uch a Thought be &s;upportable!&mdash;But what high Con&s;olation, what Tran&s;port rather, at times, mu&s;t hers be, who &s;hall be ble&s;s'd with the Hope of being an humble In|&s;trument to reclaim &s;uch a dear, dear, thrice dear
<PB N="157" REF="162">
Partner!&mdash; And that, Heart in Heart, and Hand in Hand, they &s;hall one Day i&s;&s;ue forth from this in|cumbred State into a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity, benefited by each other's Example&mdash;I will lay down my Pen, and injoy the rich Thought for a few Moments!</P>
<P>Now, my dear Mi&s;s, let me, as a Subject very plea&s;ing to me, touch upon your kind Mention of the worthy Mr. <HI>Peters</HI>'s Sentiments in relation to that Part of his Conduct to me, which (oppre&s;s'd by the Terrors and Apprehen&s;ions to which I was &s;ubjected) once indeed I cen&s;ured; and &s;o much the readier, as I had ever &s;o great an Honour for his Cloth, that I thought, to be a Clergyman, and all that was compa&s;&s;ionate, good and virtuous, was the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>But when I came to know Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> I had a high Opinion of his Worthine&s;s; and as no one can be perfect in this Life, thus I thought to my&s;elf: How hard was then my Lot, to be a Cau&s;e of Stum|bling to &s;o worthy a Heart! To be &s;ure, a Gentle|man, who knows &s;o well, and practi&s;es &s;o well, his Duty, in every other In&s;tance, and preaches it &s;o efficaciou&s;ly to others, mu&s;t have been <HI>one Day</HI> &s;en|&s;ible, that it would not have misbecome his Function and Character to have afforded that Protection to op|pre&s;&s;ed Innocence, which was reque&s;ted of him; and how would it have grieved his con&s;iderate Mind, had my Ruin been completed, that he did not!</P>
<P>But as he had once a Name-&s;ake, as one may &s;ay, that failed in a much greater In&s;tance, let not my Want of Charity exceed his Fault; but let me look upon it as an Infirmity, to which the mo&s;t perfect are liable: I was a Stranger to him; a Servant Girl carry'd off by her Ma&s;ter, a young Gentleman of violent and lawle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ions; who, in this very In|&s;tance,
<PB N="158" REF="163">
&s;hew'd how much in Earne&s;t he was &s;et upon effecting all his vile Purpo&s;es; and who&s;e Heart altho' <HI>God</HI> might touch, it was not probable any le&s;&s;er Influence could.</P>
<P>Then he was not &s;ure, that tho' he might a&s;&s;i&s;t my E&s;cape, I might not afterwards fall again into the Hands of &s;o determin'd a Violator; and that Diffi|culty would not, with &s;uch an one, inhance his Re&s;o|lution to overcome all Ob&s;tacles.</P>
<P>Moreover, he might think, that the Per&s;on, who was moving him to this worthy Mea&s;ure, might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;eeking to gratify a View of his own; and that while he was endeavouring to &s;ave, to outwatd Appearance, a Virtue in Danger, he was, in reality, only helping (at the Hazard of expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the Vindictivene&s;s of a violent Temper, and a rich Neighbour, who had Power as well as Will to re&s;ent) another to a Wife; for &s;uch was his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 175. <HI>l.</HI> 4.</NOTE> Apprehen|&s;ion, groundle&s;s, intirely groundle&s;s as it was, tho' not improbable, as it might &s;eem to him.</P>
<P>Then again, the &s;ad Examples &s;et by too many <HI>European</HI> Sovereigns, in whom the <HI>Royal</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;tly Offices</HI> are united (for are not Kings the <HI>Lord's Anointed?</HI>); and the little Scruple which many Per&s;ons, Right Reverend by their Functions and Characters, too generally make, to pay &s;ordid Court and Vi&s;its (far from bearing their Te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch Practices) even to Concubines, who have In|tere&s;t to promote them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That the&s;e Arguments were pleaded by Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> See <HI>Vol. I.</HI> p. <HI>175.</HI> l. <HI>12, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, are no &s;mall Di&s;courage|ments to a private Clergyman, to do his Duty, and to make him&s;elf Enemies among his powerful Neigh|bours, for the Cau&s;e of Virtue. And e&s;pecially (forgive me, dear Sir <HI>Simon Darnford,</HI> if you &s;hould
<PB N="159" REF="164">
&s;ee this) when an eminent Magi&s;trate, one of the principal Gentlemen of the County, of an indepen|dent Fortune, who had fine young Ladies to his Daughters, (who had nothing but their &s;uperior Conditions, not their Sex, to exempt them from like Attempts) a Ju&s;tice of Peace, and of the <HI>Quo|rum;</HI> refu&s;ed to BE a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol I. <HI>p.</HI> 174. <HI>l.</HI> 26.</NOTE> Ju&s;tice, tho' &s;uch a Breach of the <HI>Peace</HI> was made, and &s;uch a Violation of <HI>Morals</HI> plainly intended. This, I &s;ay, mu&s;t add to the Di&s;couragement of a Gentleman a little too diffi|dent and timorous of him&s;elf: And who having no one to &s;econd him, had he afforded me his Protec|tion, mu&s;t have &s;tood alone in the Gap, and made to him&s;elf, in an active Gentleman, an Enemy who had a thou&s;and de&s;irable Qualities to make one wi&s;h him for a Friend.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I think my &s;elf obliged to pity, rather than too rigorou&s;ly to cen&s;ure, the worthy Gentleman. And I mu&s;t and will always re&s;pect him: And thank him a thou&s;and times, my dear Mi&s;s, in my Name, for his Goodne&s;s, in con|de&s;cending to acknowlege, by your dear Hand, his Infirmity, as &s;uch: For this gives an excellent Proof of the natural Worthine&s;s of his Heart; and that it is beneath him to &s;eek to extenuate a Fault, when he thinks he has committed one.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Friend, I have &s;o much Honour for the Clergy of all Degrees, that I never forget in my Prayers, one Article, That God will make them burning and &s;hining Lights to the World; &s;ince &s;o much depends on their Mini&s;try and Examples, as well with re&s;pect to our publick as private Duties. Nor &s;hall the Faults of a Few make Impre&s;&s;ion upon me to the Di&s;advantage of the Order. For I am afraid a very cen&s;orious Temper, in this re&s;pect, is too
<PB N="160" REF="165">
generally the Indication of an uncharitable, and per|haps a profligate Heart, levelling Characters, in order to cover &s;ome inward Pride or &s;ecret Enormities, which they are a&s;hamed to avow, and will not be in|&s;tructed to amend.</P>
<P>Forgive, my dear Mi&s;s, this tedious Scribble. I cannot for my Life write &s;hort Letters to tho&s;e I love. And let me hope, that you will favour me with an Account of your new Affair, and how you proceed in it; and with &s;uch of your Conver&s;ations, as may give me &s;ome Notion of a polite Court&s;hip. For, alas! my dear Mi&s;s, your poor Friend knows nothing of this. All her Court&s;hip was &s;ometimes a ha&s;ty Snatch of the Hand, a black and blue Gripe of the Arm, and, Whither now!&mdash;Come, to me, when I bid you!&mdash;And Saucy-face, and Creature, and &s;uch-like, on his Part&mdash;with Fear and Trembling on mine; and&mdash;I will, I will!&mdash;Good Sir, have Mercy! At other times, a Scream, and nobody to hear or mind me; and with uplift Hands, bent Knees, and tearful Eyes&mdash;For God's &s;ake, pity your poor Ser|vant!</P>
<P>This, my dear Mi&s;s, was the hard Treatment that attended my Court&s;hip.&mdash;Pray, then, let me know, how Gentlemen court their Equals in Degree; how they look when they addre&s;s you, with their Knees bent, &s;ighing, &s;upplicating, and <HI>all that,</HI> as Sir <HI>Si|mon</HI> &s;ays, with the Words Slave, Servant, Admirer, continually at their Tongues Ends.</P>
<P>But after all, it will be found, I believe, that, be the Language and Behaviour ever &s;o ob&s;equious, it is all de&s;igned to end alike.&mdash;The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> of the polite&s;t Addre&s;s, is, I am now, dear Madam, your humble Servant: Pray be &s;o good as to let me be your Ma&s;ter.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU charm us all, with your Letters. Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> &s;ays he will never go to bed, nor ri&s;e, but he will pray for you, and de&s;ires I will return his thankful Acknowlegements for your favourable Opinion of him, and kind Allowances. If there be an Angel on Earth, he &s;ays you are one. My Papa, altho' he has &s;een your &s;tinging Reflection upon his Refu&s;al to pro|tect you, is delighted with you too; and &s;ays, when you come down to <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> again, he will be <HI>undertaken</HI> by you in good Earne&s;t; for he thinks he was wrong to deny you his Protection.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="167">We are pleas'd with your Apology for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> 'Tis &s;o much the Part of a good Wife to extenuate her Husband's Faults, and make the be&s;t of his bad Qualities, in order to give the World a good Opi|nion of him; that, together with the affecting In|&s;tances of your Humility, in looking back with &s;o much true Greatne&s;s of Mind, to what you were, make us all join to admire you, and own, that no|body can de&s;erve what you de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Yet I am &s;orry, my dear Friend, to find, notwith|&s;tanding your Defence of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that you have any Apprehen&s;ions about <HI>London.</HI> 'Tis pity any thing &s;hould give you Concern. As to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s talking in Favour of Polygamy, you cannot expect, that he can &s;hake off all his bad Notions at once. And it mu&s;t be a great Comfort to you, that his <HI>Actions</HI> do not corre&s;pond, and that his Liberties have been reduced to <HI>Notions</HI> only. In time, we hope that he will be every thing you wi&s;h him. If not, with &s;uch an Example before him, he will be the more culpable.</P>
<P>We all &s;miled at the De&s;cription of your own un|common Court&s;hip. And as they &s;ay, the Days of Court&s;hip are the happie&s;t Part of Life, if we had not known that your Days of Marriage are happier by far, than any other body's Court&s;hip, we mu&s;t needs have pity'd you. But as the one were Days of Trial and Temptation, the other are Days of Reward and Happine&s;s: May the la&s;t always continue to be &s;o, and you'll have no Occa&s;ion to think any body happier than Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>I thank you heartily for your good Wi&s;hes as to the Man of Sen&s;e. Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> has been here, and continues his Vi&s;its. He is a lively Gentleman, well enough in his Per&s;on, has a tolerable Character, yet loves Company, and will take his Bottle freely; my Papa likes him ne'er the wor&s;e for that: He talks a good deal; dre&s;&s;es gay, and even richly, and &s;eems to
<PB N="163" REF="168">
like his own Per&s;on very well: No great Plea&s;ure this for a Lady to look forward to; yet he falls far &s;hort of that genteel Ea&s;e, and graceful Behaviour, which di&s;tingui&s;h your Mr. <HI>B.</HI> from any body I know.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> would apply to my Si&s;ter. She is an ill-natur'd Girl; but would make a good Wife, I hope; and I fan&s;y &s;he'd like him well enough. I can't &s;ay I do. He laughs too much; has &s;omething boi&s;terous in his Conver&s;ation; his Complai&s;ance is not a pretty Complai&s;ance: He is well vers'd in Country Sports; and my Papa loves him for that too, and &s;ays, He is a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Gentle|man: Yes, cry I, as Gentlemen go&mdash;You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;aucy, &s;ays Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> and when a Partrige is put on your Plate, &s;nuff up your No&s;e at it, when, were you kept a little hungry, you'd have leapt at a coar&s;er Bird.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome Gentlemens Partriges, Sir, cry'd I, no better than rank Wigeons, and far &s;hort of a Stub|ble Goo&s;e. He call'd me one of his free Names.</P>
<P>But I have broken my Mind to my dear, my indul|gent Mamma, who tells me, &s;he will do me all the Plea&s;ure &s;he can; but would be loth the younge&s;t Daughter &s;hould <HI>go fir&s;t,</HI> as &s;he calls it. But if I could come and live with you a little now-and-then, I did not care who marry'd, unle&s;s &s;uch an one offer'd, as I never expect.</P>
<P>I have great Hope, the Gentleman will be ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to quit me for <HI>Nancy;</HI> for I &s;ee he has not Delicacy enough to love with any great Di&s;tin|ction. He &s;ays, as my Mamma tells me by the bye, that I am the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t humour'd; and he has found out, as he thinks, that I have &s;ome Wit, and have Ea&s;e and Freedom (and he tacks Innocence to them) in my Addre&s;s and Conver&s;ation. 'Tis well for me, <HI>he</HI> is of this Opinion; for if he thinks ju&s;tly, which I much que&s;tion, <HI>any body</HI> may think &s;o &s;till much more; for I have been far from taking
<PB N="164" REF="169">
Pains to ingage his good Word, having been under more Re&s;erve to him, than ever I was before to any body.</P>
<P>Indeed, I can't help it; for the Gentleman is for|ward without Delicacy; and (pardon me, Sir <HI>Simon</HI>) my Papa has not one bit of it neither: But is for pu&s;hing Matters on, with his rough Raillery, that puts me out of Countenance, and has already adju&s;ted the &s;ordid Part of the Preliminaries, as he tells me.</P>
<P>Yet I hope <HI>Nancy</HI>'s 3000 <HI>l.</HI> Fortune more than I am likely to have <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 162.</NOTE>, will give her the wi&s;h'd-for Pre|ference with Mr. <HI>Murray</HI>; and then, as to a Brother-in-law, in Pro&s;pect, I can put off all Re&s;traint, and return to my u&s;ual Freedom.</P>
<P>This is all that occurs worthy of Notice from us: But from you, we expect an Account of Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Vi&s;it, and of the Conver&s;ations that offer among you; and you have &s;o delightful a way of making every thing momentous, either by your Sub|ject or Reflections, or both, that we long for every Po&s;t-Day, in hopes of the Plea&s;ure of a Letter.&mdash; And yours I will always carefully pre&s;erve, as &s;o many Te&s;timonies of the Honour I receive in this Corre|&s;pondence: Which will be always e&s;teemed, as it de&s;erves, by, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>

<P>Ye&s;terday about Six in the Evening arrived here my Lord and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> their Nephew, and the Counte&s;s of <HI>C.</HI> Mother of Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> whom we did not expect, but took it for the greater Favour.

<P>We had expected them to Dinner; but they could not reach Time enough; for the Counte&s;s be|ing a little incommoded with her Journey, the Coach travelled &s;lowly.

<P><PB N="168" REF="173">Well but, &s;aid my Lady, taking my Hand, in her free Quality Way, which quite da&s;hed me, and holding it at Di&s;tance, and turning me half-round, her Eye fixed to my Wai&s;t, Let me ob&s;erve you a little, my &s;weet-fac'd Girl! &mdash; I hope I am right: &mdash; I hope you will do Credit to my Brother, as he has done you Credit.&mdash;Why do you let her lace &s;o tight, Mr. <HI>B.?</HI></P>
<P>I was unable to look up, as you may believe, Mi&s;s; my Face, all over Scarlet, was hid in my Bo&s;om, and I looked &s;o &s;illy!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid my naughty Lady, you may well look down, my good Girl: For, to talk to thee in thy own grave Way, thou ha&s;t verify'd the Scripture, <HI>What is done in Secret, &s;hall be known on the Hou&s;e-top.</HI></P>
<P>Dear my Lady! &s;aid I &mdash;for &s;till &s;he kept looking at me: And her dear Brother, &s;eeing my Confu&s;ion, in Pity to me, pre&s;s'd my blu&s;hing Face a Moment on his generous Brea&s;t; and &s;aid, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> you &s;hould not be thus hard upon my dear Girl, the Mo|ment you &s;ee her, and before &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es: But look up, my be&s;t Love, take your Revenge of my Si&s;ter, and tell her, you wi&s;h her in the &s;ame Way.</P>
<P>It is &s;o then, &s;aid my Lady: I'm glad of it with all my Heart. I will now love you &s;till better: but I almo&s;t doubted it, &s;eeing her &s;till &s;o &s;lender. But if, my good Child, you lace too tight, I'll never forgive you. And &s;o &s;he gave me a Ki&s;s of Congratulation, as &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Do you think, Mi&s;s, I did not look very &s;illy?&mdash;My Lord, &s;miling, and gazing at me from Head to Foot, Lord <HI>Jackey</HI> grinning and laughing, like an Oaf, as I then, in my Spite, thought. Indeed the Counte&s;s &s;aid, incouragingly to me, but &s;everely on Per&s;ons of Birth,&mdash; Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> you are as much too teizing,
<PB N="169" REF="174">
as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> is too ba&s;hful. But you're a happy Man, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that your Lady's Mode&s;ty and Ba&s;hfulne&s;s are the only Marks by which we can judge &s;he is not of Quality. Lord <HI>Jackey,</HI> in the Language of &s;ome Character in a Play, cry'd out, <HI>A palpable Hit, by</HI> Jupiter, and laughed egregiou&s;ly, running about from one to another, repeating the &s;ame Words.</P>
<P>We talked only upon common Topicks till Sup|per-time, and I was all Ear, as I thought it became me; for the Counte&s;s had by her fir&s;t Compliment, and by an A&s;pect as noble as intelligent, obliged me to Silence, in Awe of a Superiority &s;o vi&s;ible; as had Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s free, though plea&s;ant, Raillery, which &s;he could not help carrying on now-and-then. Be|&s;ides, Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Letters had given me greater Rea&s;on to revere her Wit and Judgment, (high as my Re&s;pect for her before had carried my Notions of her Excellence) that I had formed to my&s;elf, when I reflected on her pa&s;&s;ionate Temper, and &s;uch Parts of the Conver&s;ation I had had with her Lady|&s;hip in your Neighbourhood; which (however to be admired) fell &s;hort of her Letters.</P>
<P>When we were to &s;it down at Table, I looked, I &s;uppo&s;e, a little diffidently; for I really then thought of my Lady's Anger at the Hall, when &s;he would not have permitted me to &s;it at Table with her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p</HI> 290.</NOTE>; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aying, Take your Place, my Dear, you keep our Friends &s;tanding; I &s;at down in my u&s;ual Place. And my Lady <HI>&s;aid,</HI> None of your reproaching Eye, <HI>Pamela</HI>; I know what you hint at: And every Let|ter I have receiv'd from you, has help'd to make me cen&s;ure my&s;elf for my <HI>Lady-Airs,</HI> as you call 'em, you Saucebox you: I told you, I'd <HI>Lady-Airs</HI> you when I &s;aw you; and you &s;hall have it all in good Time.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="175">I'm &s;ure, &s;aid I, I &s;hall have nothing from your Lady|&s;hip, but what will be very agreeable: But indeed I never meant any thing particular by that, or any other Word that I wrote; nor could I think of any thing but what was highly re&s;pectful to your Lady|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Davers</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould either write or &s;peak any thing that could be taken ami&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> after Supper, and the Servants were withdrawn, began a Di&s;cour&s;e on Titles, and &s;aid, Brother, I think you &s;hould hold your&s;elf obliged to my Lord <HI>Davers</HI>; for he has &s;poken to Lord <HI>S.</HI> who made him a Vi&s;it a few Days ago, to procure you a Baronet's Patent. Your E&s;tate, and the Fi|gure you make in the World, are &s;o con&s;iderable, and your Family be&s;ides is &s;o antient, that, methinks, you &s;hould wi&s;h for &s;ome Di&s;tinction of that Sort.</P>
<P>Yes, Brother, &s;aid my Lord, I did mention it to Lord <HI>S.</HI> and told him, withal, that it was without your Knowlege or De&s;ire, that I &s;poke about it; and I was not very &s;ure you would accept of it; but 'tis a thing your Si&s;ter has wi&s;h'd for a good while.</P>
<P>What An&s;wer did my Lord <HI>S.</HI> make to it? &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;aid, We, meaning the Mini&s;ters, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;hould be glad to oblige a Gentleman of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Figure in the World; but you mention it &s;o &s;lightly, that you can hardly expect Courtiers will tender it to any Gentleman that is &s;o indifferent about it; for, Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> we &s;eldom grant Honours with|out a View, I tell you that, &s;aid he, &s;miling.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>S.</HI> might mention this as a Je&s;t, return'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI> but he &s;poke the Truth. But your Lord&s;hip &s;aid well, that I was indifferent about it. 'Tis true, 'tis an hereditary Title: But the rich Citizens, who
<PB N="171" REF="176">
u&s;ed to be &s;atisfy'd with the Title of Knights, (till they made it &s;o common, that it was brought into as great Contempt as the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Order was become &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly common in <HI>France,</HI> that, in order to &s;uppre&s;s it, the Hangman was ve&s;ted with the En&s;igns of it, which effectually aboli&s;hed it.</NOTE><HI>French</HI> Knights of St. <HI>Mi|chael,</HI> and nobody el&s;e cared to accept of it) now are ambitious of this; and, I take it, it is ha&s;tening apace into like Di&s;repute. Be&s;ides, 'tis a novel Honour, and what our Ance&s;tors, who lived at its In&s;titution, would never accept of. But were it a Peerage they would give me, which has &s;ome e&s;&s;ential Privileges and Splendors attached to it, that would make it de&s;irable to &s;ome Men, I would not enter into Con|ditions for it. Titles at be&s;t, added he, are but Sha|dows; and he that has the Sub&s;tance &s;hould be above valuing them; for who that has the whole Bird, would pride him&s;elf upon a &s;ingle Feather?</P>
<P>But, &s;aid my Lady, altho' I acknowlege, that the In&s;titution is of late Date, yet as abroad, as well as at home, it is regarded as a Title of Dignity, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the be&s;t Families among the Gentry are of it, I &s;hould be glad you would accept of it. And as to Citizens being of it, they are not many; and &s;ome of them, or their immediate De&s;cendants however, have bought them&s;elves into the Peerage it&s;elf of the one Kingdom or the other.</P>
<P>As to what it is looked upon Abroad, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that is of no Weight at all; for when an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> travels, be he of what Degree he will, if he has an Equipage, and &s;quanders his Money away, he is a Lord of cour&s;e with Foreigners: And therefore Sir <HI>Such-a-one</HI> is rather a Diminution to him, as it fixes him down to a lower Title than his Vanity would perhaps make him a&s;pire to be thought in the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of. Then, as to Citizens, in a Trading Nation like this, I am not di&s;plea&s;ed in the main, with &s;ee|ing
<PB N="172" REF="177">
the overgrown ones creeping into nominal Ho|nours; and we have &s;o many of our fir&s;t Titled Fa|milies who have ally'd them&s;elves to Trade, (who&s;e Inducements were Money only) that it cea&s;es to be either a Wonder as to the Fact, or a Di&s;grace to the Honour.</P>
<P>Well, Brother, &s;aid my Lady, I will tell you fur|ther, the Thing may be had for asking for: If you will but go to Court, and de&s;ire to ki&s;s the King's Hand, that will be all the Trouble you'll have; and pray now oblige me in it.</P>
<P>If a Title would make me either a better or a wi&s;er Man, reply'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I would imbrace it with Plea&s;ure. Be&s;ides, I am not &s;o intirely &s;atisfied with &s;ome of the Mea&s;ures now pur&s;uing, as to owe any Obligation to the Mini&s;ters. Accepting of a &s;mall Title from them, is but like putting on their Badge, or li&s;ting under their Banners; like a certain Lord we all know, who accepted of one Degree more of Title to &s;hew he was theirs, and would not have a higher, le&s;t it &s;hould be thought a Satisfaction tanta|mount to half the Pen&s;ion he demanded: And could I be ea&s;y to have it &s;uppo&s;ed, that I was an ingrateful Man for voting as I plea&s;ed, becau&s;e they gave me the Title of a Baronet?</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;aid, The World always thought Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was a Gentleman of moderate Principles, and not attached to any Party; and it was her Opi|nion, that it was far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with any Gentleman's Honour and Independency, to ac|cept of a Title from a Prince he acknowleged as his Sovereign.</P>
<P>'Tis very true, Madam, reply'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that I am attach'd to no Party, and never will; and I have a mean Opinion of many of the Heads of both: Nay, I will &s;ay further, that I wi&s;h at my Heart, the Gentlemen in the Admini&s;tration would pur&s;ue &s;uch
<PB N="173" REF="178">
Mea&s;ures, that I could give them every Vote; as I always will every one that I can; and I have no very high Opinion of tho&s;e who, right or wrong, would di&s;tre&s;s or imbara&s;s a Government. For this is cer|tain, that our Governors cannot be always in the wrong; and he therefore who never gives them a Vote, mu&s;t probably be as often out of the Way as they, and mu&s;t, moreover, have &s;ome View he will not own. But in a Country like ours, where each of the Legi&s;lative Powers is in a Manner independent, and where they are de&s;igned as mutual Checks upon each other, I have, notwith&s;tanding, &s;o great an Opi|nion of the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Oppo&s;ition &s;ometimes, that I am convinc'd it is that which mu&s;t pre&s;erve our Con&s;titution. I will therefore be a <HI>Country Gentle|man,</HI> in the true Sen&s;e of the Word, and will accept of no Favour that &s;hall make any one think I would <HI>not</HI> be of the Oppo&s;ition when I think it a nece&s;&s;ary one; as, on the other hand, I &s;hould &s;corn to make my&s;elf a Round to any Man's Ladder of Preferment, or a Caballer for the &s;ake of my own.</P>
<P>You &s;ay well, Brother, return'd Lady <HI>Davers</HI>; but you may undoubtedly keep your own Principles and Independency, and yet pay your Duty to the King, and accept of this Title; for your Family and For|tune will be a greater Ornament to the Title, than the Title to you.</P>
<P>Then, what Occa&s;ion have I for it, if that be the Ca&s;e, Madam?</P>
<P>Why, I can't &s;ay but I &s;hould be glad you had it, for your Family's &s;ake, as it is an hereditary Honour. Then it would mend the Style of your Spou&s;e here; for the good Girl is at &s;uch a Lo&s;s for an Epithet when &s;he writes, that I &s;ee the Con&s;traint &s;he lies un|der. It is, <HI>My dear Gentleman, My be&s;t Friend, My Benefactor, My dear Mr.</HI> B.; whereas Sir <HI>William</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="179">
would turn off her Periods more roundly, and no other &s;ofter Epithet would be wanting.</P>
<P>To me, reply'd he, who always de&s;ire to be di|&s;tingui&s;hed as my <HI>Pamela</HI>'s be&s;t Friend, and think it an Honour to be called <HI>her dear Mr.</HI> B. and <HI>her dear Gentleman,</HI> this Rea&s;on weighs very little, unle&s;s there were no other Sir <HI>William</HI> in the Kingdom than her Sir <HI>William</HI>; for I am very emulous of her Fa|vour, I can tell you, and think it no &s;mall Di&s;tin|ction.</P>
<P>I blu&s;hed at this too great Honour, before &s;uch Company, and was afraid my Lady would be a little piqu'd at it. But, after a Pau&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, Well then, Brother, will you let <HI>Pamela</HI> decide upon this Point?</P>
<P>Rightly put, &s;aid the Counte&s;s. Pray let Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> chu&s;e for you, Sir. My Lady has hit the Thing.</P>
<P>Very good, very good, by my Soul, &s;ays Lord <HI>Jackey,</HI> let my <HI>young Aunt,</HI> that was his Word, chu&s;e for you, Sir.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid the dear Gentleman, give us <HI>your</HI> Opinion, as to this Point.</P>
<P>But, fir&s;t, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> &s;ay you will be de|termin'd by it; or el&s;e &s;he will be laid under a Diffi|culty.</P>
<P>Well then, reply'd he, be it &s;o. I will be deter|mined by your Opinion, my Dear: Give it me freely.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Jackey</HI> rubb'd his Hands together, Charm|ing, charming, as I hope to live! By <HI>Jove,</HI> this is ju&s;t as I wi&s;h'd!</P>
<P>Well, now, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid my Lady, &s;peak your true Heart without Di&s;gui&s;e: I charge you do.</P>
<P>Why then, Gentlemen and Ladies, &s;aid I, if I mu&s;t be &s;o bold as to &s;peak on a Subject, upon which, on &s;everal Accounts, it would become me to be &s;ilent, I &s;hould be <HI>again&s;t</HI> the Title; but perhaps
<PB N="175" REF="180">
my Rea&s;on is of too private a Nature, to weigh any thing; and if &s;o, it would not become me to have any Choice at all.</P>
<P>They all called upon me for my Rea&s;on; and I &s;aid, looking down, a little aba&s;h'd, It is this: Here my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has di&s;parag'd him&s;elf by di&s;tingui&s;hing, as he has done, &s;uch a low Body as I; and the World will be apt to &s;ay, he is &s;eeking to repair <HI>one way</HI> the Honour he has lo&s;t <HI>another</HI>; and then, perhaps, it will be attributed to <HI>my</HI> Pride and Ambition: Here, they will be apt to &s;ay, the proud Cottager will needs be a Lady, in Hopes to conceal her De&s;cent; where|as, had I &s;uch a vain Thought, it would be but make|ing it the more remember'd again&s;t both my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my&s;elf. And indeed, as to my own Part, added I, I take too much Pride in having been lifted up into this Di&s;tinction, for the Cau&s;es to which I owe it, your Brother's <HI>Bounty</HI> and <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> than to be a&s;hamed of what I <HI>was:</HI> Only now-and-then I am concerned for his own &s;ake, le&s;t he &s;hould be too much cen&s;ur'd.&mdash;But this would not be prevented by the Title; but rather would be aggravated by it. &mdash;So I am humbly of Opinion again&s;t the Title.</P>
<P>The dear Gentleman had hardly Patience to hear me out, but came to me, and folding his Arms about me, &s;aid, Ju&s;t as I wi&s;h'd, have you an&s;wer'd, my beloved <HI>Pamela:</HI> I was never yet deceiv'd in you; no, not once.</P>
<P>My Lady Counte&s;s, my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> my Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> &s;aid the dear Gentleman, do we want any Titles, think you, to make us happy, but what we can confer upon our&s;elves? And he pre&s;s'd my Hand to his Lips, as he always honours me mo&s;t in Com|pany; and went to his Place, highly pleas'd; while his fine Manner drew Tears from my Eyes, and made his noble Si&s;ter's and the Counte&s;s's gli&s;ten too.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="181">My Lady &s;aid, Well, for my Part, thou art a &s;trange Girl! Where, as my Brother once &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 40.</NOTE>, gotte&s;t thou all this? Then, plea&s;antly humourous, as if &s;he was angry, &s;he changed her Tone, What &s;ignify thy <HI>meek</HI> Words, and <HI>humble</HI> Speeches, when by thy <HI>Actions,</HI> as well as <HI>Sentiments,</HI> thou reflecte&s;t upon us all?&mdash; <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, have le&s;s Merit, or take care to conceal it better: I &s;hall otherwi&s;e have no more Patience with thee, than thy Monarch has ju&s;t now &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, You're a happy Couple indeed! and I mu&s;t needs repeat to you, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> four Lines, that Sir <HI>William Davenant</HI> made upon a Lady, who could not po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve them &s;o much as yours does:
<Q><L>She ne'er &s;aw Courts; but Courts could have outdone,</L>

<L>For <HI>Nature</HI> &s;pread them in the Scorn of <HI>Art.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But, my dear Mi&s;s, how lucky one &s;ometimes is, in having what one &s;ays well accepted! Ay, that is all in all. For the Rea&s;on for the An&s;wer I gave was &s;o obvious, that one in my Circum&s;tances could not mi&s;s it. Yet what Compliments had I upon it! 'Tis a Sign they were prepared to think well of me; and that's my great Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Such &s;ort of Entertainment as this you are to ex|pect from your Corre&s;pondent. I cannot do better than I can; and it may appear &s;uch a Mixture of Self-prai&s;e, Vanity and Impertinence, that I expect you will tell me freely, as &s;oon as this comes to your Hand, whether it be tolerable to you. Yet I mu&s;t write on, for my dear Father and Mother's &s;ake,

who require it of me, and are prepared to approve of every thing that comes from me, for no other Rea&s;on but that: And I think you ought to leave me to write to them only, as I cannot hope it will be entertaining to any body el&s;e, without expecting as much Partiality and Favour from others, as I have from my dear Parents.

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, Six o'Clock.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Breakfa&s;t Conver&s;ation Ye&s;terday, (at which only Mrs. <HI>Worden,</HI> my Lady's Wo|man, and my <HI>Polly</HI> attended) was &s;o whim&s;ically particular, (tho' I doubt &s;ome of it, at lea&s;t, will appear too trifling) that I cannot help acquainting my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> with it, who is de&s;irous of knowing all that relates to Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Conduct towards me.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that I have the Honour to &s;tand very high in the Graces of Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> who on every Occa&s;ion is plea&s;ed to call me his <HI>good Si&s;ter,</HI> his <HI>dear Si&s;ter,</HI> and &s;ometimes his <HI>charming Si&s;ter</HI>; and he tells me, he will not be out of my Company for an Hour together, while he &s;tays here, if he can help it.</P>
<P>My Lady &s;eems to reli&s;h this very well in the main, tho' &s;he cannot quite &s;o readily, yet, frame her Mouth to the Sound of the Word <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> as my Lord does; of which this that follows is one In|&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="183">His Lord&s;hip had called me by that tender Name twice before, and &s;aying, I will drink another Di&s;h, I think, my <HI>good Si&s;ter</HI>; my Lady &s;aid, Your Lord|&s;hip has got a Word by the End, that you &s;eem mighty fond of: I have taken Notice, that you have called <HI>Pamela, Si&s;ter, Si&s;ter, Si&s;ter,</HI> no le&s;s than Three times in a Quarter of an Hour.</P>
<P>My Lord looked a little &s;erious: I &s;hall one Day or other, &s;aid he, be allow'd to chu&s;e my own Words and Phra&s;es, I hope: Your Si&s;ter, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> added he, often que&s;tions whether I am at Age or not, tho' the Hou&s;e of Peers made no Scruple of admit|ting me among them &s;ome Years ago.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, &s;everely, but with a &s;miling Air, 'Tis well &s;he has &s;uch a Gentleman as your Lord&s;hip for a Husband, who&s;e affectionate Indulgence overlooks all her &s;aucy Sallies. I am &s;ure, when you took her out of our Family into your own, we all thought our&s;elves bound to pray for you.</P>
<P>I thought this a great Trial of my Lady's Patience: But it was from Mr. <HI>B.</HI> And &s;he &s;aid, with a half-plea&s;ant, half-&s;erious Air, How now, Confidence! &mdash;None but my Brother could have &s;aid this, who&s;e violent Spirit was always much more intolerable than mine: But I can tell you, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I was always thought very good-humour'd, and obliging to every body, till your Impudence came from College, and from your Travels; and then, I own, your pro|voking Ways made me now-and-then a little out of the Way.</P>
<P>Well, well, Si&s;ter, we'll have no more of this Subject; only let us &s;ee, that my Lord <HI>Davers</HI> wants not his proper Authority with you, altho' you u&s;ed to keep me in Awe formerly.</P>
<P>Keep you in Awe! &mdash;That nobody could ever do yet, Boy or Man. &mdash; But, my Lord, I beg your Par|don; for this Brother will make Mi&s;chief betwixt
<PB N="179" REF="184">
us, if he can. &mdash; I only took Notice of the Word <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> &s;o often us'd, which looked more like Affecta|tion than Affection.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> &s;aid my Lord gravely, I have two Rea&s;ons for u&s;ing the Word &s;o frequently.</P>
<P>I'd be glad to hear them, &s;aid the dear taunting Lady; for I don't doubt they're mighty good ones. What are they, my Lord?</P>
<P>One is, Becau&s;e I love, and am fond of my new Relation: The other, That you are &s;o &s;paring of the Epithet, that I call her &s;o for us both.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip &s;ays well, rejoin'd my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;miling; and Lady <HI>Davers</HI> can give two Rea&s;ons why &s;he does <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Lady, now we are in for't, let us hear <HI>your</HI> two Rea&s;ons likewi&s;e: I doubt not they're wi&s;e ones too.</P>
<P>If they are <HI>yours,</HI> Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> they mu&s;t be &s;o: One is, That every Conde&s;cen&s;ion of a proud Lady, to &s;peak in her own Dialect, comes as hard and as difficult, as a Favour from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> to the petty Princes of <HI>Germany.</HI> The &s;econd, Be|cau&s;e of your Sex, (excu&s;e me, my Lady Counte&s;s) who having once made Scruples, think it incon&s;i&s;t|ent with them&s;elves to be over-ha&s;ty to alter their own Conduct, chu&s;ing rather to per&s;i&s;t in an Error, than own it to be one.</P>
<P>This proceeded from the dear Gentleman's Impa|tience to &s;ee me in the lea&s;t &s;lighted by my Lady: And I &s;aid to Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> to &s;often Matters, Never, my Lord, were Brother and Si&s;ter &s;o loving in Ear|ne&s;t, and yet &s;o &s;atirical upon each other in Je&s;t, as my good Lady and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> But your Lord&s;hip knows their Way.</P>
<P>My Lady frown'd at her Brother, but turn'd it off with an Air: I love the Mi&s;tre&s;s of this Hou&s;e, &s;aid &s;he, very well; and am quite reconcil'd to her: But
<PB N="180" REF="185">
methinks there is &s;uch a hi&s;&s;ing Sound in the Word <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> that I cannot abide it. 'Tis a true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Word, and a Word I have not been u&s;ed to, having never had a Si&s;-&s;-&s;-ter before, as you know. Speaking the fir&s;t Syllable of the Word with an emphatical Hi&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, Ob&s;erve you not, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> that you u&s;ed a Word (to avoid that) which had twice the Hi&s;&s;ing in it that <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> had;&mdash;and that was, Mi&s;-&s;-&s;-tre&s;s, with two other hi&s;&s;ing Words to ac|company it, of this-s-s Hou&s;-&s;-&s;-e: But what childi&s;h Follies does not Pride make one &s;toop to! Excu&s;e, my Lady, (to the Counte&s;s) &s;uch poor low Con|ver&s;ation as we are dwindled into.</P>
<P>O! Sir, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, the Conver&s;ation is very agreeable; and I think, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> you're fairly caught.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Lady, then help me, good <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> there's for you! to a little Sugar. Will that plea&s;e you, Sir?</P>
<P>I am always pleas'd, reply'd her Brother, &s;miling, when Lady <HI>Davers</HI> acts up to her own Character, and the good Sen&s;e &s;he is Mi&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P>Ay, ay, return'd &s;he, my good Brother, like other wi&s;e Men, takes it for granted, that it is a Mark of good Sen&s;e to approve of whatever <HI>he</HI> does.&mdash; And &s;o, for this one Time, I am a very &s;en&s;ible body with him. &mdash; And I'll leave off, while I have his good Word. Only one thing I mu&s;t &s;ay to you, my Dear, turning to me, That tho' I call you <HI>Pamela,</HI> and <HI>Pamela,</HI> as I plea&s;e, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I love you as well as if I called you <HI>Si&s;ter, Si&s;ter,</HI> as Lord <HI>Davers</HI> does, at every Word.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip gives me great Plea&s;ure, &s;aid I, in this kind A&s;&s;urance; and I don't doubt but I &s;hall have the Honour of being called by that tender Name, if I can be &s;o happy as to de&s;erve it; and
<PB N="181" REF="186">
I'll lo&s;e no Opportunity that &s;hall be afforded me, to &s;hew how &s;incerely I will endeavour to do &s;o.</P>
<P>She was plea&s;ed to ri&s;e from her Seat: Give me a Ki&s;s, my dear Girl; you de&s;erve every thing: And permit me to &s;ay <HI>Pamela</HI> &s;ometimes, as the Word occurs; for I am not u&s;ed to &s;peak in Print, and I will call you <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> when I think of it, and love you as well as ever Si&s;ter loved another.</P>
<P>The&s;e proud and pa&s;&s;ionate Folks, &s;aid my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> how good they can be, when they reflect a little on what becomes their Characters!</P>
<P>So then, &s;aid my Lady, I am to have no Merit of my own, I &s;ee, do what I will. This is not quite &s;o generous in my Brother.</P>
<P>Why, you &s;aucy Si&s;ter, &s;aid he, excu&s;e me, Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> what Merit <HI>would</HI> you have? Can People merit by doing their Duty? And is it &s;o great a Prai&s;e that you think fit to own for a Si&s;ter, &s;o de&s;erving a Girl as this, whom I take Pride in calling my Wife?</P>
<P>Thou art what thou always wa&s;t, return'd my Lady; and were I in this my imputed Pride to want an Excu&s;e, I know not the Creature living that ought &s;o &s;oon to make one for me as you.</P>
<P>I <HI>do</HI> excu&s;e you, &s;aid he, for <HI>that</HI> very Rea&s;on, if you plea&s;e: But it little becomes either your Pride, or mine, to do any thing that wants Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Mighty moral! mighty grave, truly! <HI>Pamela,</HI> Friend, Si&s;ter,&mdash;there's for you! thou art a happy Girl to have made &s;uch a Reformation in thy hone&s;t Man's way of <HI>Thinking</HI> as well as <HI>Acting.</HI> But now we are upon this Topick, and none but Friends about us, I am re&s;olved to be even with thee, Brother. <HI>Jackey,</HI> if you are not for another Di&s;h, I wi&s;h you'd with|draw. <HI>Polly Barlow,</HI> we don't want you. <HI>Beck,</HI> you may &s;tay. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> obey'd; and <HI>Polly</HI> went out: For you mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s, that my Lady <HI>Da|vers</HI> will have none of the Men-Fellows, as &s;he
<PB N="182" REF="187">
calls them, to attend upon us at Tea. And I can|not &s;ay but I think her intirely in the right, for &s;eve|ral Rea&s;ons that might be given.</P>
<P>When they were withdrawn, my Lady repeated, Now we are upon this Topick of Reclaiming and Reformation, tell me, thou bold Wretch; for you know I have &s;een all your Rogueries in <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Papers; tell me, if ever Rake but thy&s;elf made &s;uch an Attempt as thou did&s;t, on this dear good Girl, in Pre&s;ence of a virtuous Woman, as Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> always was noted to be? As to the other vile Crea|ture <HI>Jewkes,</HI> 'tis le&s;s Wonder, altho' in <HI>that</HI> thou had&s;t the Impudence of <HI>him</HI> who &s;et thee to Work: But to make thy Attempt before Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and in &s;pite of her Struggles and Reproaches, was the very Stretch of &s;hamele&s;s Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The dear Gentleman &s;eemed a little di&s;concerted, and &s;aid, Surely, &s;urely, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> this is going too far! Look at <HI>Pamela</HI>'s blu&s;hing Face, and down|ca&s;t Eye, and wonder at your&s;elf for this Que&s;tion as much as you do at me for the Actions you &s;peak of.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;aid to me, My dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> I wonder not at this &s;weet Confu&s;ion on &s;o affecting a Que&s;tion; but, indeed, &s;ince it has come in &s;o na|turally, I mu&s;t &s;ay, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that we have all, and my Daughters too, wonder'd at this, more than any Part of your Attempts; becau&s;e, Sir, we thought you one of the mo&s;t civiliz'd Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI> and that you could not but wi&s;h to have &s;aved Ap|pearances a little.</P>
<P>Tho' this, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is to <HI>you,</HI> my <HI>Pamela,</HI> the Renewal of Griefs; yet hold up your dear Face.&mdash; You may&mdash;the Triumph was yours&mdash;the Shame and the Blu&s;hes ought to be mine.&mdash;And I will humour my &s;aucy Si&s;ter in all &s;he would have me &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="188">Nay, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> you know the Que&s;tion; I cannot put it &s;tronger.</P>
<P>That's very true, reply'd he. &mdash; But what would you have me &s;ay? Do you expect I &s;hould give you a <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for an Attempt that appears to you &s;o very &s;hocking?</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, don't &s;ay <HI>Appears to Lady</HI> Davers; for (excu&s;e me) it will appear &s;o to every one who hears of it.</P>
<P>I think my Brother is too hardly u&s;ed, &s;aid Lord <HI>Davers:</HI> He has made all the Amends he could make; and <HI>you,</HI> my Si&s;ter, who were the Per&s;on of|fended, forgive him now, I hope; don't you?</P>
<P>I could not an&s;wer; for I was quite confounded; and made a Motion to withdraw: But Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, Don't go, my Dear: Tho' I ought to be a&s;ham'd of an Action &s;et before me in &s;o full a Glare, in Pre&s;ence of Lord <HI>Davers</HI> and the Counte&s;s;&mdash;yet I will not have you &s;tir, becau&s;e I forget how you repre&s;ented it, and you mu&s;t tell me.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I cannot, &s;aid I: Pray, my dear Ladies, pray, my good Lord, and dear Sir, don't thus <HI>renew my Griefs,</HI> as you were plea&s;ed ju&s;tly to phra&s;e it.</P>
<P>I have the Repre&s;entation of that Scene in my Pocket, &s;aid my Lady; for I was re&s;olved, as I told Lady <HI>Betty,</HI> to &s;hame the wicked Wretch with it, the fir&s;t Opportunity I had; and I'll read it to you; or, rather, you &s;hall read it your&s;elf, Boldface! if you can.</P>
<P>So &s;he pulled tho&s;e Leaves out of her Pocket, wrapp'd up carefully in a Paper.&mdash;Here, I believe, he who could act thus, mu&s;t read it; and, to &s;pare <HI>Pamela</HI>'s Confu&s;ion, read it to your&s;elf; for we all know how it was.</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid he, taking the Papers, I can &s;ay &s;ome|thing that will abate the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of this heavy

Charge, or el&s;e I &s;hould not &s;tand thus at the in&s;o|lent Bar of my Si&s;ter, an&s;wering her Interrogatories.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> read this to him&s;elf, and &s;aid, This is a dark Affair, as it is here &s;tated; and I can't &s;ay, but <HI>Pamela,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> too, had a great deal of Rea&s;on to apprehend the wor&s;t: But &s;urely Readers of it, who were le&s;s Parties in the &s;uppo&s;ed Attempt, and who were not determined at all Events to con|demn me, might have made a more favourable Con|&s;truction for me, than you, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> have done, in the &s;trong Light in which you have &s;et this heinous Matter before us.</P>
<P>However, &s;ince my Lady Counte&s;s, and Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> &s;eem to expect, that I &s;hall particularly an|&s;wer to this black Charge, I will, at a proper Time, if it will be agreeable, give you a brief Hi&s;tory of my Pa&s;&s;ion for this dear Girl, how it commenc'd, and increas'd, and my own Struggles with it: And this will introduce, with &s;ome little Advantage to my&s;elf perhaps, what I have to &s;ay, as to this &s;uppo&s;ed At|tempt; and at the &s;ame time inable you the better to account for &s;ome Facts which you have read in my pretty Accu&s;er's Papers.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ed every one, and they begg'd him to begin <HI>then:</HI> But he &s;aid, It was Time we &s;hould think of Dre&s;&s;ing, the Morning being far advanc'd; and if no Company came in, he would give them, in the Afternoon, the Particulars they de&s;ired to hear.</P>
<P>The three Gentlemen rode out, and returned ju&s;t Time enough to dre&s;s before Dinner; and my Lady and the Counte&s;s al&s;o took an Airing in the Chariot. Ju&s;t as they returned, Compliments came from &s;eve|ral of the neighbouring Ladies to our noble Gue&s;ts,
<PB N="185" REF="190">
on their Arrival in the&s;e Parts; and, to as many as &s;ent, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> de&s;ir'd their Companies for To|morrow in the Afternoon, to drink Tea: But Mr. <HI>B.</HI> having fallen in with &s;ome of the Gentlemen like|wi&s;e, he told me, we &s;hould have mo&s;t of our vi&s;it|ing Neighbours at Dinner, and de&s;ired Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> might prepare accordingly for them.</P>
<P>After Dinner Mr. <HI>H.</HI> took a Ride out, attended with Mr. <HI>Colbrand,</HI> of whom he is very fond, ever &s;ince he frighten'd Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Footmen at the Hall, threatening <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 250.</NOTE> to chine them, if they offer'd to &s;top his Lady; for, he &s;ays, he loves a Man of Cou|rage; very probably knowing his own Defects that way; for my Lady now-and-then calls him a Chic|ken-hearted Fellow. And then Lord and Lady <HI>Da|vers,</HI> and the Counte&s;s, reviv'd the Subject of the Morning; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to begin in the Manner I &s;hall mention by-and-by.

<P>Now, my dear Mi&s;s, I will proceed.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I need not, &s;aid the dear Gentleman, ob&s;erve to any body who knows what Love is, (or rather that violent Pa&s;&s;ion which we mad young Fellows are apt to mi&s;cal Love) what mean Things it puts us upon; how it unmans, and levels with the Du&s;t, the proude&s;t Spirit.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I began very early to take Notice of this lovely Girl, even when &s;he was hardly Thirteen Years old; for her Charms increa&s;ed every Day, not only in my Eye, but in the Eyes of every one who beheld her.

<PB N="186" REF="191">
her Waiting-maid, and her Cabinet of Rarities, were her Boa&s;ts, and equally &s;hewn to every Vi&s;i|tor: For, be&s;ides the Beauty of her Figure, and the genteel Air of her Per&s;on, the dear Girl had a &s;urpri&s;ing Memory, a Solidity of Judgment above her Years, and a Docility &s;o unequal'd, that &s;he took all Parts of Learning, which her Lady, as fond of in&s;tructing her, as &s;he of improving by In&s;|truction, crouded upon her; in&s;omuch that &s;he had Ma&s;ters to teach her to dance, to &s;ing, and to play on the Spinnet, whom &s;he every Day &s;urpris'd by the Readine&s;s wherewith &s;he took every thing.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I remember once, my Mother prai&s;ing her Girl before me, and my Aunt <HI>B.</HI> (who is &s;ince dead) I could not but take Notice to her of her Fond|ne&s;s for her, and &s;aid, What do you de&s;ign, Ma|dam, to do <HI>with,</HI> or do <HI>for,</HI> this <HI>Pamela</HI> of yours? The Accompli&s;hments you give her will do her more Hurt than Good: For they will &s;et her &s;o much above her Degree, that what you intend as a Kindne&s;s may prove her Ruin.</Q></P>

For &s;o the Ladies ob&s;erved in his Narration.&mdash;Is it very like the Style of a true Penitent?&mdash;But indeed he went on better, and concluded be&s;t of all.</P>
<P>But don't you ob&s;erve what a dear good Lady I had? Ble&s;&s;ings, a thou&s;and Ble&s;&s;ings, on her beloved Memory! Were I to live to &s;ee my Childrens Chil|dren, they &s;hould be all taught to li&s;p her Prai&s;es, before they could &s;peak. <HI>My</HI> Gratitude &s;hould always be renew'd in <HI>their</HI> Mouths; and GOD, and my dear Father and Mother, my Lady, and my Ma&s;ter that was, my be&s;t Friend that is, but princi|pally, as mo&s;t due, the FIRST, who in&s;pired all the re&s;t, &s;hould have their Morning, their Noon-tide, and their Evening Prai&s;es, as long as I lived!&mdash;</P>
<P>I will only ob&s;erve further, as to this my Third Conver&s;ation piece, That my Lord <HI>Davers</HI> offer'd to extenuate &s;ome Parts of his dear Brother-in-law's Conduct, which he did not him&s;elf vindicate; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that my Lord was always very candid to him, and kind in his Allow|ances for the Sallies of an ungovernable Youth. Upon which my Lady &s;aid, a little tartly, Yes, and for a very good Rea&s;on, I doubt not: For who cares to condemn him&s;elf?</P>
<P>Nay, &s;aid my Lord, plea&s;antly, don't put us upon a Foot neither: For what Sallies I made, before I knew your Lady&s;hip, were but like tho&s;e of a Fox, who now-and-then runs away with a &s;traggling Pullet, when nobody &s;ees him: Whereas tho&s;e of my Bro|ther
<PB N="214" REF="219">
were like the Inva&s;ions of a Lion, breaking into every Man's Fold, and driving the Shepherds, as well as the Sheep, before him.&mdash;Ay, &s;aid my Lady, but I can look around me, and have Rea&s;on perhaps to think the invading Lion has come off, little as he de&s;erv'd it, better than the creeping Fox, who, with all his Cunning, &s;ometimes &s;uffers for his pilfering. Theft.</P>
<P>O Mi&s;s, the&s;e Gentlemen are &s;trange Creatures!&mdash; What can they think of them&s;elves? for they &s;ay, there is not one virtuous Man in five!&mdash;But I hope for our Sex's &s;ake, as well as for the World's &s;ake, all is not true that evil Fame reports; for, you know, every Man-tre&s;pa&s;&s;er mu&s;t find or make a Woman-tre&s;pa&s;&s;er!&mdash;And if &s;o, what a World is this!&mdash; And how mu&s;t the Innocent &s;uffer from the Guilty!&mdash; Yet, how much better is it to &s;uffer one's &s;elf, than to be the Cau&s;e of another's Suffering?</P>
<P>I long to hear of you. And mu&s;t &s;horten my fu|ture Accounts, or I &s;hall do nothing but write, and tire <HI>you</HI> into the Bargain, tho' I cannot my dear Father and Mother. I am, my dear Mi&s;s,</P>

The good Man lov'd me mo&s;t violently, nay, he could not live without me; Life was no Life, unle&s;s I favour'd him: But yet, after a few more of the&s;e Flights, he is trying to &s;it down &s;atisfy'd without my Papa's fooli&s;h perver&s;e Girl, as Sir <HI>Si|mon</HI> calls me, and to tran&s;po&s;e his Affections to a worthier Object, my Si&s;ter <HI>Nancy</HI>; and it would make you &s;mile to &s;ee how, a little while before he <HI>directly</HI> apply'd to her, &s;he &s;crew'd up her Mouth to my Mamma, and, Truly, &s;he'd have none of <HI>Pol|ly</HI>'s Leavings; no, not &s;he!&mdash;But no &s;ooner did he declare him&s;elf in Form, than the <HI>gaudy Wretch,</HI> as he was before with her, became a <HI>well-dre&s;s'd</HI> Gentle|man; &mdash; the <HI>chattering Magpye,</HI> (for he talks and laughs much) <HI>quite conver&s;ible,</HI>&mdash;and has &s;omething <HI>agreeable</HI> to &s;ay on <HI>every Subject.</HI> Once, He would make a good Ma&s;ter of the Buck-hounds; but now, Really, the <HI>more</HI> one is in his Company, the <HI>more polite</HI> one finds him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mi&s;s</HI> Darnford,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM retired from a very bu&s;y Day, having had no le&s;s than Fourteen of our Neighbours, Gentle|men and Ladies, to Dinner with us: The Occa&s;ion principally to welcome our noble Gue&s;ts into the&s;e Parts; Mr. <HI>B.</HI> having, as I mentioned in a former, turn'd the intended Vi&s;it into an Entertainment, after his u&s;ual generous Manner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and Lord <HI>Davers</HI> are gone Part of the Way with them home; and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> or Lord <HI>Jackey,</HI> as we call the Gentleman, who will always be young, mounted, with his Favourite <HI>Colbrand,</HI> as an E&s;corte to the Counte&s;s and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> who are gone to take an Airing in the Chariot. They offer'd to take the Coach, if I would have gone; but being fa|tigu'd, I de&s;ir'd to be excus'd. So I retir'd to my
<PB N="218" REF="223">
Clo&s;et, and Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> who is &s;eldom out of my Thoughts, coming into my Mind, I had a new Recruit of Spirits, which inabled me to re&s;ume my Pen, and thus I proceed with my Journal:</P>
<P>Our Company was, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Characters of mo&s;t of the&s;e Gentlemen and Ladies, &s;ee <HI>Vol. I.</HI> p. <HI>59, 85.</HI> and <HI>Vol. II.</HI> p. <HI>354</HI> to <HI>358,</HI> and <HI>376</HI> to <HI>380.</HI></NOTE> the Earl and Counte&s;s of <HI>D.</HI> who are &s;o fa&s;hionable a marry'd Couple, that the Earl made it his Boa&s;t, and his Counte&s;s bore it like one accu&s;tomed to &s;uch Treatment, that he had not been in his Lady's Company an Hour abroad before for &s;even Years. You know his Lord&s;hip's Chara|cter: Every body does; and there is not a wor&s;e, as Report &s;ays, in the Peerage.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Atkyns,</HI> a &s;ingle Gentleman, not a little finical and ceremonious, and a mighty Beau, tho' of the tawdry Sort, and affecting foreign Airs, as if he was afraid it would not be judg'd by any other Mark, that he had travelled.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Arthur,</HI> and his Lady, a moderately happy Couple, who &s;eem always when together to behave as if they were upon a Compromi&s;e; that is, that each would take it in Turn to &s;ay free Things of the other &mdash; tho' &s;ome of their Freedoms are of &s;o cut|ting a Nature, that it looks as if they intended to divert the Company at their own Expence. The Lady, being of a noble Family, takes great Pains to let every one know, that &s;he values her&s;elf not a little upon that Advantage: But otherwi&s;e has many good Qualities.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Brooks,</HI> and his Lady, a Gentleman who is a free Joker on &s;erious Subjects, but a good-natur'd Man, and &s;ays &s;prightly things with no ill Grace; but his Lady is a little re&s;erved, and of a haughty Turn, tho' To-day &s;he happened to be freer than u&s;ual; as was observed at Table by</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224">Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> who is a Maiden Lady of Family, noted for her Wit and Repartee, and who &s;ays many good Things, with &s;o little Doubt, and really &s;o good a Grace, that one cannot help being pleas'd with her. This Lady is generally gallanted by</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> of the Grove, as he is called, to di|&s;tingui&s;h him from a rich Citizen of that Name, who is &s;ettled in the&s;e Parts, but being covetous and proud, is &s;eldom admitted among the Gentry in their Vi&s;its or Parties of Plea&s;ure. Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> is a &s;hrewd Gentleman, but has been a little too much of the Libertine Ca&s;t, and has lived freely as to Wo|men; and for that Rea&s;on has not been received by Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> who hates free Actions, tho' &s;he'll u&s;e free Words, mode&s;tly free, as &s;he calls them, that is to &s;ay, the Double Entendre, in which Sir <HI>Simon Darnford,</HI> a Gentleman you are not unacquainted with, takes great Delight; tho', by the way, what that worthy Gentleman calls innocent, Lady <HI>Towers</HI> would blu&s;h at.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Dormer,</HI> a Gentleman of a very courteous Demeanour, a Widower, was another, who always &s;peaks well of his decea&s;ed Lady, and of all the Sex for her &s;ake.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Chapman,</HI> and his Lady, a well-behav'd Cou|ple, who are not a&s;hamed to be very tender and ob&s;erving to one another, but without that cen&s;ure|able Fondne&s;s which &s;its &s;o ill upon &s;ome married Folks in Company.</P>
<P>Then there was the <HI>Dean,</HI> our good Mini&s;ter, whom I name la&s;t, becau&s;e I would clo&s;e with one of the worthie&s;t; and his <HI>Daughter,</HI> who came to &s;upply her Mamma's Place, who was indi&s;pos'd; a well-behav'd prudent young Lady. And here were our Fourteen Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s of <HI>C.</HI> Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> Mr. <HI>H.</HI> my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and your humble Servant,
<PB N="220" REF="225">
made up the re&s;t of the Company. So we had a capacious and brilliant Circle, you may imagine; and all the Avenues to the Hou&s;e were crouded with their Equipages.</P>
<P>The Subjects of Di&s;cour&s;e at Dinner were vari|ous, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, and the Circle was too large to fall upon any regular or very remarkable Topicks. A good deal of &s;prightly Wit, however, flew about, between the Earl of <HI>D.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Towers</HI> and Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> in which that Lord &s;uffered as he de&s;erved; for he was by no means a Match for the Lady, e&s;pecially as the Pre&s;ence of the Dean was a Re&s;traint, as was very vi&s;ible, upon him, and Mr. <HI>Brooks</HI> too: So much Awe will the Character of a good Clergyman always impre&s;s upon even forward Spirits, where he is known to have had an inviolable Regard to it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the good Gentleman has a genteel and in-offen&s;ive Vein of Raillery him&s;elf, and &s;o was too hard for them at their own Weapons.</P>
<P>But after Dinner was over, and the Servants were withdrawn, Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> began to &s;ingle me out, as he loves to do, for a Subject of Encomium, and made &s;ome high Compliments to my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> on his Choice; and wi&s;hed (as he often does) he could find ju&s;t &s;uch another Per&s;on for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Towers</HI> told him, That it was a Thing as un|accountable as it was unrea&s;onable, that every Rake who loved to de&s;troy Virtue, &s;hould expect to be re|warded with it: And if his <HI>Brother B.</HI> had come off &s;o well, &s;he thought no one el&s;e ought to expect it.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Davers</HI> &s;aid, It was a very ju&s;t Ob&s;ervation; and &s;he thought 'twas pity there was not a Law, that every Man who made a Harlot of an hone&s;t Wo|man, &s;hould be obliged to marry one of another's making.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226">That would be too &s;evere, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid; it would be Puni&s;hment enough, if he was to marry his own; and e&s;pecially if he had not &s;educed her under Pro|mi&s;e of Marriage.</P>
<P>Then you'd have a Man be obliged, reply'd Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> to &s;tand to his Promi&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, Madam.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid &s;he, the Proof would be difficult perhaps, and the mo&s;t unguilty Heart of our Sex, might be lea&s;t able to make it out. But what &s;ay you, my Lord <HI>D.</HI> continued Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> will you, and my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> join to bring in a Bill into the Hou&s;e of Peers, for the Purpo&s;es I mentioned? I fan&s;y my Brother would give it all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance he could in the Lower Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> is highly un|rea&s;onable, I think, to propo&s;e that: It would be enough, &s;urely, that a Man &s;hould be obliged, as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, to marry the Woman he him&s;elf &s;e|duced.</P>
<P>The Earl &s;aid, That he thought neither the one nor the other &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon any Man; for that when Womens Virtue was their Glory, and they were brought up with that Notion, and to avoid the Snares of Men, he thought, if they yielded, they ought to pay the Forfeit, and take the Di&s;grace of it to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>May I ask your Lord&s;hip, &s;aid I, How it comes to pa&s;s, that a Woman's Virtue is her Glory, and that a Man's &s;hall not be his?&mdash;Or, in other Words, Why you think Virtue in a Man is not as requi&s;ite as in a Woman?</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom, Madam, reply'd the Earl, has made it very different; and tho&s;e Things which are &s;canda|lous in a Lady, are not &s;o in a Gentleman.</P>
<P>Will your Lord&s;hip argue, that it &s;hould be &s;o, becau&s;e it is &s;o? Does not the Gentleman call him|&s;elf
<PB N="222" REF="227">
the Head of his Family? Is it not incumbent upon him then to &s;et a good Example? And will he plead it as a Fa&s;hion, that he may do by the deare&s;t Relatives of another Man's Family, what, if any one &s;hould attempt to do by his, he would mortally re&s;ent?</P>
<P>Very well ob&s;erved, Madam, &s;aid the Dean: There is not a Free-liver in the World, I believe, that can an&s;wer that Argument.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid the Earl, pray &s;peak to your Lady: She is too clo&s;e upon <HI>us.</HI> And where Sentiments have been &s;o well &s;upported by a Conduct &s;o uni|form and exemplary, I chu&s;e not to enter the Li&s;ts with &s;uch an Antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ince your Lord&s;hip will &s;peak in the Plural Number U S, let me &s;ay, We mu&s;t not pretend to hold an Argument on this Sub|ject.&mdash;But, however, I think, my Lord, you &s;hould not call upon a Man to defend it, who, bad as he has been, never committed a Fault of this Nature, that he was not &s;orry for, tho' the Sorrow generally la&s;ted too little a while.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> (&s;aid Lady <HI>Towers</HI>) has &s;ome Merit with me for that An&s;wer: And he has &s;till a greater on another Account; and that is, that he has &s;een his Error &s;o early, and has left his Vices before they have left him.</P>
<P>She looked, as every one did, on the Earl, who appeared a little di&s;concerted, as one con&s;cious, that he de&s;erved the Reflection. And the Dean &s;aid, Lady <HI>Towers</HI> ob&s;erves very well: For, altho' I pre|&s;ume not to make per&s;onal Applications, yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, That the Gentleman who &s;ees his Error in the Prime of Life, before he is overtaken by &s;ome awakening Misfortune, may be called one of the happie&s;t of tho&s;e who have erred.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228">Ay, Mr. Dean, &s;aid Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> I can tell you one thing, that &s;uch another Buttre&s;s as you know who, taken away from Libertini&s;m, and &s;uch another Example as a certain Lady every Day gives, would go near in a few Years to ruin the Devil's Kingdom in <HI>Bedford&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The Gentlemen looked round upon one another upon this home Pu&s;h: And the Lady would not let them recover it. See, &s;aid &s;he, how the Gentlemen look upon one another, as who &s;hould &s;ay, each to his Companion, I'm not &s;o bad as you!</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> I &s;ee, my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>D.</HI> and Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> look mo&s;t con|cerned.</P>
<P>Faith, Ladies, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> this is too &s;evere|ly per&s;onal: A Man who contends with a Lady has a fine Time of it; for we are under Re&s;traint, while you &s;ay any thing you plea&s;e. But let me tell you, there's not a Man of us all, 'tis my Opinion, that could have attempted what a certain Renegado has attempted, tho' he is &s;o readily acquitted.</P>
<P>Not &s;o ha&s;ty, my good Friend, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> You don't con&s;ider well what you &s;ay, nor of whom: For did <HI>I</HI> take upon my&s;elf to cen&s;ure <HI>you?</HI> But tho' I may challenge you to &s;ay the wor&s;t you can, becau&s;e I always dealt upon my own Stock, while other People I could name enter'd into a Society and club|bed for Mi&s;chief; yet I &s;ee you deal with a Brother Rake, when he reforms, as Highwaymen with one of their Gang, who would fain withdraw and be hone&s;t, but is kept among them by Fear of an Im|peachment.</P>
<P>But is not this, Ladies, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Arthur,</HI> a &s;ad thing, that &s;o many fine Gentlemen as think them|&s;elves concern'd in this Charge, &s;hould have no way to clear them&s;elves but by Recrimination?</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="229">Egad, &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas Atkyns,</HI> I know not what you're about, Gentlemen! You make but &s;orry Fi|gures, by my Faith! &mdash; I have heard of many <HI>queer</HI> Pranks among my <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI> Neighbours; but I ble&s;s my Stars, I was in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> all the Time.</P>
<P>Said Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Arthur</HI> &s;poke the Words <HI>fine Gentlemen,</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> thought him&s;elf obliged to enter upon his own Defence.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid the Earl; and the be&s;t of it is, Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> pleads not his <HI>Virtue</HI> neither, that he did not join his <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI> Neighbours, but his <HI>Ab&s;ence.</HI></P>
<P>Gad take me, returned he, putting a Pinch of Snuff to his No&s;e with an Air, you're plaguy &s;harp, Gentlemen: I believe in my Con&s;cience you're in a Confederacy, as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ays, and would &s;wear an hone&s;t Man into the Plot, that would not care for &s;uch Company. What &s;ay you, Mr. <HI>H.?</HI> which Side are you of?</P>
<P>The Gallows, reply'd he, in his u&s;ual blunt Way, are of the Ladies Side; and I was always of the Side of the Gallows.</P>
<P>That &s;hews, return'd Lady <HI>Towers,</HI> that Mr. <HI>H.</HI> is more afraid of the <HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> than of <HI>de&s;erv|ing</HI> it.</P>
<P>'Tis well, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that any Con&s;ideration de|ters a Gentleman at Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Time of Life. What may be <HI>Fear</HI> now, may improve to <HI>Virtue</HI> by-and-by.</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers, Jackey</HI> is one of his Uncle's <HI>Foxes.</HI> He'd be glad to &s;nap up a &s;traggling Pullet, if he was not well look'd after, perhaps.</P>
<P>Pray, my Dear, &s;aid Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> forbear: You ought not to introduce two different Conver&s;ations in different Companies.</P>
<P>I think, truly, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> you &s;hould take the Dean's Hint, my good Friends; el&s;e you'll be le&s;s <HI>polite</HI> than <HI>per&s;onal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="230">Well, but, Gentlemen, &s;aid Lady <HI>Arthur,</HI> &s;ince you &s;eem to have been &s;o hard put to it, as <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Gentlemen, what's to be done with the marry'd Man who ruins an innocent body? What Puni&s;hment, Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> &s;hall we find out for &s;uch? and what Reparation to the Injured? This, it &s;eems, was &s;aid with a particular View to the Earl, on a late &s;canda|lous Occa&s;ion: But I knew it not till afterwards.</P>
<P>As to the Puni&s;hment of the Gentleman, reply'd Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> where the Law has not provided for it, it mu&s;t be left, I believe, to his Con&s;cience. It will then one Day be heavy enough. But as to the Re|paration to the Woman, &s;o far as it can be made, it will be determinable as the unhappy Per&s;on <HI>may</HI> or may <HI>not</HI> know, that her Seducer is a marry'd Man: If &s;he knows he is, I think <HI>&s;he</HI> neither de&s;erves Re|dre&s;s nor Pity, tho' it alleviates not <HI>his</HI> Guilt. But if the Ca&s;e be otherwi&s;e, and <HI>&s;he</HI> had no means of informing her&s;elf that he was marry'd, and he pro|mi&s;ed to make her his Wife, to be &s;ure, tho' <HI>&s;he</HI> can|not be acquitted, <HI>he</HI> de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t Puni&s;h|ment that can be inflicted. What &s;ay you, Mrs. <HI>B.?</HI></P>
<P>If I mu&s;t &s;peak my Mind, reply'd I, I think, that &s;ince Cu&s;tom, as the Earl &s;aid ju&s;t now, exacts &s;o lit|tle Regard to Virtue from Men, and &s;o much from Women, and &s;ince the De&s;igns of the former upon the latter are &s;o flagrantly avow'd and known, the poor Creature, who &s;uffers her&s;elf to be &s;educed either by a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> or <HI>marry'd</HI> Man, <HI>with</HI> Promi&s;es, or <HI>without,</HI> has nothing to do, but to &s;eque&s;ter her&s;elf from the World, and dedicate the Remainder of her Days to Penitence and Ob&s;curity. As to the Gen|tleman, added I, he mu&s;t be left, I doubt, to his Con&s;cience, as you &s;ay, Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> which will, &s;ooner than he wi&s;hes, find him out.</P>
<P>Every young Lady has not your angelick Per|fection, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Dormer.</HI> And there are
<PB N="226" REF="231">
Ca&s;es in which the Fair Sex de&s;erve Compa&s;&s;ion, ours Execration. Love may in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teal upon a &s;oft Heart: When once admitted, the Oaths, Vows, and Prote&s;tations of the favour'd Object, who per|haps, on all Occa&s;ions, declaims again&s;t the Deceivers of his Sex, confirm her good Opinion of him, till, having lull'd a&s;leep her Vigilance, in an unguarded Hour he takes Advantage of her un&s;u&s;pecting Inno|cence. Is not &s;uch a poor Creature to be pity'd! And what Puni&s;hment does not &s;uch a Seducer de&s;erve?</P>
<P>You have put, Sir, &s;aid I, a moving Ca&s;e, and in a generous Manner. What, indeed, does not &s;uch a Deceiver de&s;erve?</P>
<P>And the more, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Chapman,</HI> as the mo&s;t innocent Heart is generally the mo&s;t credulous.</P>
<P>Very true, &s;aid my Counte&s;s; for &s;uch an one as would do no Harm <HI>to</HI> others, &s;eldom &s;u&s;pects any <HI>from</HI> others! And her Lot is very unequally ca&s;t; admir'd for that very Innocence, which tempts &s;ome brutal Ravager to ruin it.</P>

<P>But, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> very &s;atirically, Whither, Ladies, are we got? We are upon the Subject of Virtue and Honour. Let us talk of &s;omething, in which the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> can join with us. This is &s;uch an one, you &s;ee, that none but the Dean and Mr. <HI>Dormer</HI> can di&s;cour&s;e upon.</P>
<P>Let us then, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> to be even with <HI>one</HI> Lady at lea&s;t, find a Subject that will be <HI>new</HI> to her. And that is CHARITY.</P>
<P>Does what I &s;aid concern Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> more than any other Gentleman, retorted Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> that he is di&s;po&s;ed to take Offence at it?</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pardon me, Mrs. <HI>Towers,</HI> a Lady &s;hould never make a Motion to wave &s;uch Sub|jects
<PB N="227" REF="232">
as tho&s;e of Virtue and Honour; and le&s;s &s;till in Company, where there is &s;o much Occa&s;ion, as &s;he &s;eems to think, for inforcing them.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;aid &s;he, I de&s;ire not to wave the Subject, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. And if you think, Sir, it may do good, we will continue it, for the &s;akes of all <HI>you,</HI> Gentlemen, (looking round her archly) who are of Opinion, you may be benefited by it.</P>
<P>We are going into Per&s;onals again, Gentlemen and Ladies, &s;aid the Earl.</P>
<P>And that won't bear, my Lord, you &s;eem to think? retorted Lady <HI>Davers.</HI></P>
<P>A Toa&s;t to the King and Royal Family brought on Publick Affairs, and Politicks; and the Ladies withdrawing to Coffee and Tea, I have no more to &s;ay as to this Conver&s;ation, having repeated all that I remember was &s;aid to any Purpo&s;e; for &s;uch large Companies, you know, Mi&s;s, don't always produce the mo&s;t agreeable and edifying Subjects. But this I was the willinger to recite, becau&s;e I thought the Characters of &s;ome of our Neighbours would be thereby made more familiar to you, if ever I &s;hould have the Happine&s;s to &s;ee you in the&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>I will only add, that Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> the Dean's Daugh|ter, is a very mode&s;t and agreeable young Lady, and a perfect Mi&s;tre&s;s of Mu&s;ick; in which the Dean takes great Delight al&s;o, and is a fine Judge of it. The Gentlemen coming in, to partake of our Coffee and Conver&s;ation, as they &s;aid, obtain'd of Mi&s;s to play &s;everal Tunes on the Spinnet; and would have me do &s;o too. But really, Mi&s;s <HI>L.</HI> &s;o very much &s;ur|pa&s;s'd me, that had I regarded my Reputation for play|ing above the De&s;ire I had (as I &s;aid, and truly &s;aid) to oblige the good Company, I ought not to have pretended to touch a Key after &s;uch a Mi&s;tre&s;s of it.

<HEAD>SATURDAY <HI>Morning.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Counte&s;s being a little indi&s;pos'd, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> and I took an Airing this Morning in the Chariot, and had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e toge|ther. Her Lady&s;hip was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s great Favour and Tenderne&s;s for me; gave me a great deal of good Advice as to the Care &s;he would have me take of my&s;elf, and told me, that her Hopes, as well as her Brother's, all centred in my Welfare; and that the Way I was in, made her love me better and better.</P>
<P>She was plea&s;ed to tell me, how much &s;he ap|prov'd of the dome&s;tick Management; and to &s;ay, that &s;he never &s;aw &s;uch Regularity and Method in any Family in her Life, where was the like Number of Servants: Every one, &s;he &s;aid, knew their Duty, and did it without Speaking to, in &s;uch Silence, and with &s;o much apparent Chearfulne&s;s and Delight, without, the lea&s;t Hurry or Confu&s;ion, that it was her Surprize and Admiration. But kindly would have it, that I took too much upon me: Yet, &s;aid &s;he, I don't &s;ee, but you are always fre&s;h and lively, and never &s;eem tir'd or fatigu'd; and are always dre&s;s'd and ea&s;y, &s;o that no Company find you unprepar'd, or unfit to receive them, come when they will, whe|ther it be to Breakfa&s;t or Dinner.</P>
<P>I told her Lady&s;hip, I owed all this, and mo&s;t of the Conduct for which &s;he was plea&s;ed to prai&s;e me, to her dear Brother, who at the Beginning of my
<PB N="229" REF="234">
Happine&s;s, gave me &s;everal Cautions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. p. 207.</NOTE> and In&s;tru|ctions for my Behaviour; which had always been the Rule of my Conduct ever &s;ince, and I hoped ever would be: To &s;ay nothing, added I, which would be very unju&s;t, of the Help I receive from worthy Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> who is an excellent Manager.</P>
<P><HI>Good Creature, &s;weet Pamela,</HI> and <HI>charming Girl,</HI> were her common Words, and &s;he was plea&s;ed to at|tribute to me &s;uch a graceful and unaffected Ea&s;e, and would have it, that I have a natural Dignity in my Per&s;on and Behaviour, which command Love and Reverence at the &s;ame time; in&s;omuch that, my dear Mi&s;s, I am in Danger of being as proud as any thing. For you mu&s;t believe, that her Lady&s;hip's Appro|bation gives me great Plea&s;ure; and the more, as I was afraid, before &s;he came, I &s;hould not have come off near &s;o well in her Opinion.</P>
<P>As the Chariot pa&s;&s;ed along, &s;he took great No|tice of the Re&s;pects paid me by People of different Ranks, and of the Ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed upon me, by &s;everal, as we proceeded; and &s;aid, She &s;hould fare well, and be rich in good Wi&s;hes for being in my Company.</P>
<P>The good People, who know us, <HI>will</HI> do &s;o, Madam, &s;aid I; but I had rather have their &s;ilent Prayers, than their audible ones; and I have cau&s;ed &s;ome of them to be told &s;o; but they &s;ay, they can|not help it: And one hone&s;t Man &s;aid, That every|body's Hearts &s;prang to their Lips as &s;oon as I ap|peared, and they could not keep their Words in.</P>
<P>What I apprehend, Madam, continued I, is, that you will be more unea&s;y To-morrow, when at Church you'll &s;ee a good many People in the &s;ame way&punc; Indeed, added I, my Story, and your dear Brother's Tenderne&s;s to me, are &s;o much talked of, that many
<PB N="230" REF="235">
Strangers are brought thither to &s;ee us. 'Tis the only thing, &s;aid I, (and &s;o it is, Mi&s;s) that makes me de|&s;irous to go to <HI>London;</HI> for by the Time we return, the Novelty, I hope, will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>Then I mention'd &s;ome Ver&s;es of Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> which had been laid under the Cu&s;hions in our Seat at Church, two <HI>Sundays</HI> ago, by &s;ome unknown Hand; and how unea&s;y they have made me. I will tran&s;cribe them, Mi&s;s, and give you the Particulars of our Conver&s;ation on that Occa&s;ion. The Ver&s;es are the&s;e:
<Q><LG>
<L>Thou robb'&s;t my Days of Bus'ne&s;s and Delights,</L>
<L>Of Sleep thou robb'&s;t my Nights.</L>
<L>Ah! lovely Thief! what wilt thou do?</L>
<L>What! rob me of Heav'n too!</L>
<L>Thou ev'n my Pray'rs do&s;t &s;teal from me,</L>
<L>And I with wild Idolatry,</L>
<L>Begin to God, and end them all to thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, to what Purpo&s;e &s;hould I &s;peak?</L>
<L>No, wretched Heart, &s;well till you break:</L>
<L>She cannot love me, if &s;he would;</L>
<L>And, to &s;ay Truth, 'twere pity that &s;he &s;hould.</L>
<L>No, to the Grave thy Sorrows bear,</L>
<L>As &s;ilent as they will be there:</L>
<L>Since that lov'd Hand this mortal Wound does give,</L>
<L>So hand&s;omely the Thing contrive,</L>
<L>That &s;he may guiltle&s;s of it live:</L>
<L>So peri&s;h, that her killing thee</L>
<L>May a Chance-medley, and no Murder be!</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I had them in my Pocket, and read them to my Lady; who ask'd me, If her Brother had &s;een them? I told her, It was he that found them under the Cu|&s;hion I u&s;ed to &s;it upon; but did not &s;hew them to me, till I came home; and that I was &s;o vexed at them, that I could not go to Church in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="236">What &s;hould you be vex'd at, my Dear? &s;aid &s;he: How could you help it?&mdash;My Brother was not di&s;turb'd at them, was he?</P>
<P>No, indeed, &s;aid I: He chid <HI>me</HI> for being &s;o; and was plea&s;ed to make me a fine Compliment upon it; that he did not wonder, that every body who &s;aw me, lov'd me.&mdash;But I &s;aid, This was all wicked Wit was good for, to in&s;pire &s;uch Boldne&s;s in bad Hearts, which might otherwi&s;e not dare to &s;et Pen to Paper to affront any one.</P>
<P>But pray, Madam, added I, don't own I have told you of them, le&s;t there &s;hould be a Po&s;&s;ibility for a Shadow of a Thought, that I was prompted by &s;ome vile, &s;ecret Vanity in being admir'd, to tell your Lady&s;hip of them: When, I am &s;ure, they have vex'd me more than enough. For is it not a &s;ad Thing, that the Church &s;hould be profan'd by &s;uch Actions, and &s;uch Thoughts, as ought not to be brought into it?</P>
<P>Then, Madam, to have any wicked Man <HI>dare</HI> to think of one with impure Notions! It gives me the le&s;s Opinion of my&s;elf, that I &s;hould be &s;o much as <HI>thought of</HI> as the Object of any wicked Body's Wi&s;hes. I have called my&s;elf to Account upon it, whether any Levity in my Looks, my Dre&s;s, my Appearance, could imbolden &s;uch an affrontive In&s;olence. And I have thought upon this Occa&s;ion better of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Delicacy, than I did, when I read of it; who, upon an Attempt made on his Wife, to which, however, it does not appear &s;he gave the lea&s;t Incouragement, &s;aid, to tho&s;e who pleaded for her again&s;t the Divorce he was re&s;olved upon, <HI>That the Wife of</HI> Cae&s;ar <HI>ought not to be &s;u&s;pected.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, continued I, it would extremely &s;hock me, but to know, that any wicked Heart had conceived a De&s;ign upon me; Upon <HI>me,</HI> give me Leave to repeat, who&s;e only Glory and Merit is, that
<PB N="232" REF="237">
I have had the Grace to with&s;tand the greate&s;t of Trials and Temptations, from a Gentleman more worthy to be beloved both for Per&s;on and Mind, than any Man in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervation, my Dear, is truly delicate, and &s;uch as becomes your Mind and Character. And I really think, if any Lady in the World is &s;ecure from vile Attempts, it mu&s;t be you; not only from your Story &s;o well known, and the Love you bear to your Man, and his Merit to you, but from the Prudence, and natural <HI>Dignity,</HI> I will &s;ay, of your Behaviour, which, tho' all graceful Ea&s;e and Chearfulne&s;s, is what would &s;trike dead the Hope of any pre&s;um|ptuous Libertine, the Moment he &s;ees you.</P>
<P>How can I enough, return'd I, and ki&s;&s;ed her Hand, acknowlege your Lady&s;hip's polite Goodne&s;s in this Compliment! But, my Lady, you &s;ee by the very In&s;tance I have mention'd, that a Liberty <HI>is</HI> taken, which I cannot think of without Pain.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;uch a Liberty, reply'd my Lady, as &s;hews more De&s;pair than Hope, and is a Confirmation of my Sentiments on the Prudence and Dignity which not only I, but every body attributes to you.</P>
<P>Kind, kind, Lady <HI>Davers!</HI> &s;aid I, again pre&s;&s;ing her Hand with my Lips. But I will turn my Quar|rel, &s;ince I know not, and hope I never &s;hall, the vile Tran&s;criber, upon the Author of the Ver&s;es, I think; for had they not been written, I &s;hould not have been thus in&s;ulted, perhaps.</P>
<P>But, reply'd my Lady, <HI>Cowley</HI> is my favourite Poet. He has a beautiful Imagination, a va&s;t deal of brilliant Wit, and a Cha&s;tity too in his Works, that hardly any of the Tribe can boa&s;t.</P>
<P>I once liked him better too, &s;aid I, than I have done &s;ince this; for he was one of the Poets that my Lady would permit me to read &s;ometimes; and his Pieces in Prai&s;e of the Country Life, and tho&s;e
<PB N="233" REF="238">
charming Lines again&s;t Ambition, u&s;ed to delight me much:
<Q><L>If e'er Ambition &s;hould my Fancy cheat</L>
<L>With any Wi&s;h &s;o <HI>mean,</HI> as to be great,</L>
<L>Continue, Heav'n, &s;till from me to remove</L>
<L>The humble Ble&s;&s;ings of the Life I love!</L></Q></P>
<P>I have taken Notice of the&s;e Lines often, &s;aid my Lady, and been pleas'd with them. But I think you have no Rea&s;on to be out of Conceit with <HI>Cowley,</HI> for the ill U&s;e made of his Ver&s;es. He but too na|turally de&s;cribes the Influence of Love; which fre|quently interferes with our better Duties. And there is &s;omething very natural, and ea&s;y, and witty, in the fir&s;t Lines:&mdash; And &s;hews that the Poet <HI>laments</HI> the too ingaging Impre&s;&s;ions which Love made upon his Mind, even on the mo&s;t &s;olemn Occa&s;ions&mdash;<HI>What! rob me of Heav'n too!</HI>&mdash;A bad Heart, <HI>Pamela,</HI> could not have &s;o lamented, or &s;o written!</P>
<P>Ah! but, Madam, &s;aid I, I have &s;een, in your dear Brother's Collection of Manu&s;cripts, a Poem in which this very Point, nice as it is, is touched with much greater Propriety.</P>
<P>Can you repeat it, my Dear?</P>
<P>The Lines I <HI>mean,</HI> I can. Your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t know, It was upon a Quarrel between a beloved Couple, where the Gentleman had been wild, and the Lady's ill-natur'd Uncle, who wanted to break the Match, (tho' it was de&s;igned by her decea&s;ed Parents) had fomented it, &s;o that &s;he would not look upon her Lover, nor &s;ee him, nor receive a Letter of Excu&s;e from him, tho' they were betroth'd, and &s;he lov'd him dearly. This oblig'd him to throw him&s;elf in her Way at Church, and thus he writes:
<Q><PB N="234" REF="239">
<L>But, O! forgive me, Heav'n, if oft my Fair</L>
<L>Robs thee of my Devoir, di&s;turbs my Pray'r,</L>
<L>Confounds my be&s;t Re&s;olves, and makes me prove,</L>
<L>That &s;he's too much a Rival in thy Love!</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e now, Madam, continued I, are the Lines I admire:
<Q><L>But <HI>better</HI> Thoughts my happier Hopes &s;ugge&s;t,</L>
<L>When once this &s;tormy Doubt's expell'd my Brea&s;t;</L>
<L>When once this <HI>agitated Flame</HI> &s;hall turn</L>
<L>To <HI>&s;teadier</HI> Heat, and more <HI>inten&s;ely</HI> burn,</L>
<L>My dear <HI>MARIA</HI> then, thought I, will join,</L>
<L>And we, <HI>one Heart, one Soul,</HI> &s;hall <HI>all</HI> be <HI>THINE!</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Ay, <HI>Pamela,</HI> the&s;e are very pretty Lines. You mu&s;t procure me a Sight of the Whole. They mu&s;t needs let me into an entertaining Hi&s;tory of a Love Quarrel.&mdash;Mean time, you mu&s;t not think ill of my Favourite <HI>Cowley</HI>; for I &s;ay, with a Gentleman, who&s;e Judgment, and good Heart, have hardly any Equal, That tho' <HI>Cowley</HI> was going out of Fa&s;hion with &s;ome, yet he &s;hould always &s;u&s;pect the Head or the Heart of him or her, who could not ta&s;te, and delight in, his Beauties.</P>
<P>The Words,
<Q><L>She <HI>cannot</HI> love me, if &s;he would,</L>
<L>And, <HI>to &s;ay</HI> Truth, 'twere pity that &s;he &s;hould;</L></Q>
Shew the Goodne&s;s of the Poet's Heart; and even, that the Tran&s;criber, be he who he will, had not the <HI>wor&s;t,</HI> that he could &s;ingle out <HI>the&s;e</HI>; when, if he would be &s;hining with borrow'd Rays, he might have cho&s;en a much wor&s;e Poet to follow.</P>
<P>Oh! Madam, reply'd I, &s;ay not one Word in behalf of the wicked Tran&s;criber. For a Wretch to entertain the Shadow of a Wi&s;h for a marry'd
<PB N="235" REF="240">
Per&s;on, is a Degree of Impurity that ought not to be excus'd: But to commit &s;uch Thoughts to Writing, to put that Writing under the Seat of the marry'd Per&s;on at Church, when her Heart &s;hould be ingag'd <HI>wholly</HI> in her fir&s;t Duties; where too it might be more likely to be &s;een by the Pew-keepers than her, and &s;o &s;pread over the whole Pari&s;h, to the Propaga|tion of bad Ideas, whenever I appeared; and, more|over, might come to the Hands of one's Husband, who from his own free Life formerly, and high Pa&s;|&s;ions, as far as the Tran&s;criber knew, might be un|ea&s;y at, and angry with, the innocent Occa&s;ion of the In&s;ult&mdash;Be&s;ides the Apprehen&s;ion it mu&s;t give one, that the Man who could take this vile Step, might proceed to greater Lengths, which my bu&s;y Fears could improve to Duelling and Murder&mdash;Then the Concern it mu&s;t fill me with, to the diverting of my Mind from my fir&s;t Regards, when <HI>any one</HI> looked at me wi&s;tfully, that <HI>he</HI> might be the Tran&s;criber, which mu&s;t always give me Confu&s;ion of Thought: &mdash;Deare&s;t Madam, can one forbear being vex'd, when all the&s;e Imaginations dart in upon a Mind ap|prehen&s;ive as mine? Indeed this Action has given me great Unea&s;ine&s;s at times ever &s;ince, and I cannot help it.</P>
<P>I am pleas'd with your Delicacy, my Dear, as I &s;aid before. &mdash; You can never err, while thus watch|ful over your Conduct; &mdash; and I own, you have the more Rea&s;on for it, as you have marry'd a mere <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> an open-ey'd Rake, that was her Word, who would, on the lea&s;t Surmizes, tho' ever &s;o cau&s;e|le&s;s on your Part, have all his Pa&s;&s;ions up in Arms, in Apprehen&s;ion of Liberties that might be offer'd like tho&s;e he has not &s;crupled to take.</P>
<P>Oh! but, Madam, &s;aid I, your dear Brother has given me great Satisfaction in one Point; for you mu&s;t think, I &s;hould not love him as I ought, if I

had not a Concern for his future Happine&s;s, as well as his pre&s;ent; and that is, he has a&s;&s;ured me, that in all the Liberties he has taken, he never attempted a marry'd Lady, but always abhorred the Thought of &s;o great an Evil.</P>
<P>'Tis pity, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, that a Man who could conquer his Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>&s;o far,</HI> could not &s;ubdue them intirely. This &s;hews it was in his own Power to do &s;o; and increa&s;es his Crime: And what a Wretch is he, who &s;crupling, under Pretence of Con&s;cience or Honour, to attempt Ladies <HI>within</HI> the Pale, boggles not to ruin a poor Creature <HI>with|out</HI>; although he knows, he thereby, mo&s;t probably, for ever, deprives her of that Protection, by pre|venting her Marriage, which, even among &s;uch Rakes as him&s;elf, is deemed inviolable, and &s;o ca&s;ts the poor Creature headlong into the Jaws of Per|dition?</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, reply'd I, this was the very Inference I made upon the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And what could he &s;ay?</P>
<P>He &s;aid, my Inference was ju&s;t; but call'd me <HI>pretty Preacher</HI>;&mdash;and once having caution'd me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. p. 155.</NOTE> not to be over-&s;erious with him, &s;o as to ca&s;t a Gloom, as he &s;aid, over our innocent Injoyments, I never dare to urge Matters further, when he calls me by that Name.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Lady, thou'rt an admirable Girl! God's Goodne&s;s was great to our Family, when it gave thee to it.</P>
<P>No Wonder, continu'd her Lady&s;hip, as my Bro|ther &s;ays, every body that &s;ees you, and has heard your Character, loves you: And this is &s;ome Excu&s;e for the incon&s;iderate Folly even of this unknown Tran&s;criber.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="242">Ah!

<P>Your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid I, all the&s;e Things con&s;ider'd, had but too much Rea&s;on to be angry at your dear Brother's Proceedings, &s;o well as you always lov'd him, &s;o high a Concern as you always had to promote his Honour and Intere&s;t, and &s;o far as you had gone with Lady <HI>Betty.</HI></P>
<P>I tell thee, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, that the old Story of <HI>Eleanor</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> run in my Head all the Way of my Journey, and I almo&s;t wi&s;hed for a Po|tion to force down thy Throat: And when I came,
<PB N="240" REF="245">
and found thy lewd Paramour ab&s;ent, (for little did I think thou wa&s;t marry'd to him, tho' I expected thou would&s;t endeavour to per&s;uade me to believe it) apprehending, that his Intrigue with thee would effectually fru&s;trate my Hopes as to Lady <HI>Betty</HI> and him; Now, thought I, all happens as I wi&s;h!&mdash;Now will I confront this brazen Girl!&mdash;Now will I try her Innocence, as I plea&s;e, by offering to take her with me out of his Hands; if &s;he refu&s;es, take that Refu&s;al for a Demon&s;tration of her Guilt; and then, thought I, I will make the Creature provoke me, in the Pre&s;ence of my Nephew and my Wo|man (and I hoped to have got that Woman <HI>Jewkes</HI> to te&s;tify for me too); and I cannot tell what I might have done, if thou had&s;t not got out of the Window as thou did&s;t, e&s;pecially after thou had&s;t told me, thou wa&s;t as much marry'd as I was, and had&s;t &s;hewn me his tender Letter to thee, which had a quite different Effect upon me than thou had&s;t hoped for. But if I had committed any Act of Violence, what Remor&s;e &s;hould I have had, when I came to reflect, and had known what an Excellence I had injured! Thank God, thou did&s;t e&s;cape me! thank God thou did&s;t! And then her Lady&s;hip folded her Arms about me, and ki&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>This was a &s;ad Story, you'll &s;ay, my dear Mi&s;s: And I wonder what her Lady&s;hip's Pa&s;&s;ion would have made her do! Surely &s;he would not have <HI>killed me dead</HI> indeed! &s;urely &s;he would not!&mdash;Let it not, however, Mi&s;s, nor you, my dear Father and Mo|ther,&mdash; when you &s;ee it,&mdash;go out of your own Hands, nor be read, for my Lady's &s;ake, to any body el&s;e&mdash;No, Mi&s;s, not to your own dear Mamma.&mdash;It made me tremble a little, even at this Di&s;tance, to think what a &s;ad thing Pa&s;&s;ion is, when Way is given to its ungovernable Tumults, and how it deforms and deba&s;es the noble&s;t Minds!</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="246">We returned from this agreeable Airing but ju&s;t Time enough to dre&s;s before Dinner, and then I at|tended my Lady, and we went together into the Counte&s;s's Apartment, where I received abundance of Compliments from both. As this brief Con|ver&s;ation will give you &s;ome Notion of that Manage|ment and Oeconomy for which they heaped upon me their kind Prai&s;es, I will recite to you what pa&s;&s;ed in it, and hope you will not think me too vain; and the le&s;s, becau&s;e what I underwent formerly from my Lady's Indignation, half intitles me to be proud of her pre&s;ent Kindne&s;s and Favour.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Davers</HI> &s;aid, Your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t excu&s;e us, that we have lo&s;t &s;o much of your Company; but here, this &s;weet Girl has entertained me in &s;uch a manner, that I could have &s;taid out with her all Day; and &s;everal times did I bid the Coachman prolong his Circuit.</P>
<P>My good Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> Madam, &s;aid I, has given me inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure, and has been all Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Favour, and made me as proud as proud can be.</P>
<P>You, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid &s;he, may have given great Plea&s;ure to Lady <HI>Davers</HI>; for it cannot be otherwi&s;e.&mdash;But I have no great Notion of her Lady&s;hip's Conde&s;cen&s;ion, as you call it, (pardon me, Madam, &s;aid &s;he to her, &s;miling) when &s;he cannot rai&s;e her Style above the Word <HI>Girl,</HI> coming off from a Tour you have made &s;o delightful to her.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t to you, my Lady <HI>C.</HI> reply'd her Lady&s;hip, with great Goodne&s;s, that Epithet which once in|deed I be&s;tow'd thro' Pride, as you'll call it, I now give for a very different Rea&s;on. I begin to doubt, whether to call her Si&s;ter is not more Honour to my|&s;elf than to her; and to this Hour am not quite con|vinc'd. When I am, I will call her &s;o with Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I was quite overcome with this fine Compliment, but could not an&s;wer a Word: And the Counte&s;s
<PB N="242" REF="247">
&s;aid, I could have &s;pared you longer, had not the Time of Day compell'd your Return. For I have been very agreeably entertained, as well as you, al|tho' but with the Talk of my Woman and yours: For here they have been giving me &s;uch an Account of Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Oeconomy, and Family Management, as has highly delighted me. I never knew the like; and in &s;o young a Lady too. We &s;hall have &s;trange Reformations to make, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> when we go home, in our Families, were we to follow &s;o good an Example.</P>
<P>Why, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> continued her Lady&s;hip, you outdo all your Neighbours. And indeed I am glad I live &s;o far from you:&mdash;For were I to try to imitate you, it would &s;till be <HI>but</HI> Imitation, and you'd have the Honour of it.</P>
<P>Yet you hear, and you &s;ee by Ye&s;terday's Con|ver&s;ation, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> how much her be&s;t Neighbours of both Sexes admire her: They all yield to her the Palm, unenvying.</P>
<P>Then, my good Ladies, &s;aid I, it is a Sign I have mo&s;t excellent Neighbours, full of Genero&s;ity, and willing to incourage a young Per&s;on in doing right things: So it makes, con&s;idering what I was, more for their Honour than my own. For what Cen&s;ures &s;hould not &s;uch an one as I de&s;erve, who have not been educated to fill up my Time like Ladies of Con|dition, were I not to imploy my&s;elf as I do? I, who have &s;o little other Merit, and who brought no For|tune at all?</P>
<P>Come, come, <HI>Pamela,</HI> none of your &s;elf-denying Ordinances&mdash;that was Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s Word&mdash;You mu&s;t know &s;omething of your own Excellence:&mdash; If you do not, I'll tell it you, becau&s;e there is no Fear you will be proud or vain upon it. I don't &s;ee then, that there is the Lady in your Neighbourhood, of any Neighbourhood, that behaves with a more
<PB N="243" REF="248">
proper Decorum, or better keeps up the Port of a Lady, than you do. How you manage it I can't tell; but you do as much by a Look, and a plea&s;ant one too, that's the Rarity! as I do by high Words, and pa&s;&s;ionate Exclamations: I have often nothing but Blunder upon Blunder, as if the Wretches were in a Confederacy to try my Patience.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Madam, &s;aid I, the Awe they have of your Lady&s;hip, becau&s;e of your high Qualities, makes them commit Blunders; for I my&s;elf have always been more afraid of appearing before your Lady&s;hip, when you have vi&s;ited your honoured Mother, than of any body el&s;e, and have been the more &s;en&s;ibly aukward thro' that very aweful Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>P&s;ha, p&s;ha! <HI>Pamela,</HI> that is not it: 'Tis all in your|&s;elf. I us'd to think my Mamma, and my Brother too, had as aukward Servants as I ever &s;aw any|where &mdash;except Mrs. <HI>Jervis.</HI>&mdash;Well enough for a Batchelor, indeed!&mdash;But, here!&mdash;thou ha&s;t not parted with one Servant&mdash;Ha&s;t thou?</P>
<P>No, my Lady.</P>
<P>How! &s;aid the Counte&s;s; what Excellence is here! All of them, pardon me, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> your Fel|low-&s;ervants, as one may &s;ay, and all of them &s;o re|&s;pectful, &s;o watchful of your Eye; and you, at the &s;ame time, &s;o gentle to them, &s;o ea&s;y, &s;o chearful!</P>
<P>Don't you think me, Mi&s;s, in&s;ufferably vain? But 'tis what they were plea&s;ed to &s;ay. 'Twas their Goodne&s;s to me, and &s;hew'd how much they can excel in generous Politene&s;s. So I will proceed.</P>
<P>Why this, continued the Counte&s;s, mu&s;t be <HI>born</HI> Dignity,&mdash;<HI>born</HI> Di&s;cretion.&mdash;Education cannot give it:&mdash;If it could, why &s;hould not <HI>we</HI> have it?</P>
<P>The Ladies &s;aid many more kind things of me then; and after Dinner they mentioned all over again, with Additions, before my be&s;t Friend, who was kindly delighted with the Encomiums given me by
<PB N="244" REF="249">
two Ladies of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing Judgment in all other Ca&s;es. They told him, how much they ad|mired my Family Management: Then would have it, that my Genius was univer&s;al, for the Imploy|ments and Accompli&s;hments of my Sex, whether they con&s;ider'd it, they were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, as im|ploy'd in Penman&s;hip, in Needle-work, in paying or receiving Vi&s;its, in Mu&s;ick, and I can't tell how many other Qualifications, which their Goodne&s;s made them attribute to me, over and above the Fa|mily Management; &s;aying, that I had an Under|&s;tanding that comprehended every thing, and an Eye that penetrated into the very Bottom of Matters in a Moment, and was never at a Lo&s;s for the <HI>Should be,</HI> the <HI>Why</HI> or <HI>Wherefore,</HI> and the <HI>How;</HI> the&s;e were their comprehen&s;ive Words &mdash; I did every thing with &s;o much Celerity, clearing all as I went, and leaving nothing, that was their Ob&s;ervation, to re|cur or come over again, that could be di&s;patched at once: By which means, they &s;aid, every Hand was clear to undertake a new Work, as well as my own Head to direct it; and there was no Hurry nor Confu&s;ion; but every coming Hour was fre&s;h and ready, and unincumber'd, (&s;o they &s;aid) for its new Employment; and to this they attributed that Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure with which every thing was performed, and that I could <HI>do,</HI> and <HI>cau&s;e</HI> to be done, &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s without Hurry either to my&s;elf or Servants.</P>
<P>The&s;e kind things, they would have it, they ob|&s;erved in part them&s;elves, and in part from the Ob|&s;ervations of their Women, who looked, they &s;aid, &s;o narrowly into every Part of the Management, as if they were Spies upon it; but were &s;uch faithful ones, that it was like a good Cau&s;e brought to a &s;trict Scrutiny, the brighter and fairer for it.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Mi&s;s, did their Lady&s;hips prai&s;e me for what I <HI>ought</HI> to be; and I will endeavour to
<PB N="245" REF="250">
improve more and more by their kind Admonitions, which come cloathed in the agreeable and flatter|ing Shape of Prai&s;e, the noble&s;t Incitement to the doing of one's Duty.</P>
<P>Judge you how plea&s;ing this was to my be&s;t Be|loved, who found, in their kind Approbation, &s;uch a Ju&s;tification of his own Conduct, that could not fail of being plea&s;ing to him, e&s;pecially as Lady <HI>Da|vers</HI> was one of the kind Prai&s;ers.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Davers</HI> was &s;o highly delighted, that he ro&s;e once, begging his Brother's Excu&s;e, to &s;alute me, and remained &s;tanding over my Chair, with a Plea|&s;ure in his Looks that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, now-and-then lifting up his Hands, and his good-natur'd Eye gli&s;tening with Joy, which a Pier-gla&s;s gave me the Opportunity of &s;eeing, as &s;ometimes I &s;tole a ba&s;h|ful Glance towards it, not knowing how or which way to look.

<P>But my only Doubt is, that to Ladies, who have not been accu&s;tomed perhaps to the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Strict|ne&s;s, I &s;hould make my&s;elf cen&s;urable, as if I aimed at too much Perfection: For however one's Duty is one's Duty, and ought not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with; yet when a Per&s;on, who u&s;es to be remi&s;s, &s;ees &s;o hard a Task before them, and &s;o many great Points to get over, all to be no more than tole|rably regular, it is rather apt to frighten and di&s;|courage than to allure; and one mu&s;t proceed, as I have read Soldiers do in a difficult Siege, Inch
<PB N="248" REF="253">
by Inch, and be more &s;tudious to intrench and for|tify them&s;elves as they go on gaining upon the Ene|my, than by ru&s;hing all at once upon an Attack of the Place, be repul&s;ed, and perhaps obliged with great Lo&s;s to abandon an hopeful Enterprize.</P>
<P>And permit me to add, that, young as I am, I have often ob&s;erved, that over-great Strictne&s;&s;es all at once injoin'd, and in&s;i&s;ted upon, are not fit for a beginning Reformation, but for &s;tronger Chri&s;tians only; and therefore generally do more Harm than Good, in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>What a mi&s;erable Creature am I, &s;aid a neigh|bouring Widow Gentlewoman, (whom I vi&s;ited in her Illne&s;s, at her own De&s;ire, tho' a Stranger to me but by Name) if all the Good <HI>you</HI> do, and the &s;trict Life <HI>you</HI> live, is no more than ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Salvation!</P>
<P>I &s;aw the poor Gentlewoman, thro' Illne&s;s and low Spirits, was ready to de&s;pond, and, to comfort her, I &s;aid, Dear Madam, don't be ca&s;t down: God Almighty gives us all a Light to walk by in the&s;e our dark Paths; and 'tis my humble Opinion, He will judge us according to the <HI>unforced</HI> and <HI>unbya&s;&s;ed</HI> U&s;e we make of that Light. I think it my Duty to do &s;everal. Things, which, perhaps, the Circum|&s;tances of others will not permit them to do, or which they, on &s;erious and di&s;intere&s;ted Reflection, may not think ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be done: In each Ca&s;e our Judgments are a Law to each; and I ought no more to excu&s;e my&s;elf from doing &s;uch Parts as I think my Duty, than you to condemn your&s;elf for not doing what does not appear to you &s;o &s;trictly nece&s;&s;ary: And be&s;ides, Madam, you may do as much Good one way, as I another, and &s;o both may be equally u&s;eful in the general Sy&s;tem of Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="254">But &s;hall I not be too grave, my dear Mi&s;s?&mdash; Excu&s;e me; for this is <HI>Saturday</HI> Night; and as it was a very good Method which the ingenious Authors of the <HI>Spectators</HI> took, generally to treat their more &s;erious Subjects on this Day; &s;o I think one &s;hould, when one can, con&s;ider it as the preparative Eve to a &s;till better.</P>

<HEAD>SUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, my dear Mi&s;s, by what I have already written, it is become in a manner nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint you briefly with the Method my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> not only permits, but incourages me to take in the Family he leaves to my Care, as to the <HI>Sunday</HI> Duty.</P>
<P>The worthy Dean, at my Reque&s;t, and by my Beloved's Permi&s;&s;ion, recommended to me, as a &s;ort of Family Chaplain, for <HI>Sundays,</HI> a young Gentle|man of great Sobriety, and Piety, and &s;ound Princi|ples, who having but lately taken Orders, has at pre|&s;ent no other Provi&s;ion. And this Gentleman comes, and reads Prayers to us about Seven in the Morning, in the le&s;&s;er Hall, as we call it, a retired Apartment, next the little Garden; for we have no Chapel with us here, as in your Neighbourhood: And this gene|rally, with &s;ome &s;uitable Exhortation, or Medita|tion out of &s;ome good Book, which the young Gen|tleman is &s;o kind to let me chu&s;e now-and-then, when I plea&s;e, takes up little more than half an Hour.</P>
<P>We have a great Number of Servants of both Sexes; and my&s;elf, my good Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and my <HI>Polly Barlow,</HI> are generally in a little Clo&s;et, which, when we open the Door, is but ju&s;t a Separation, and that's all, from the Hall.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="255">Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> (for that is our young Clergyman's Name) has a Desk, at which &s;ometimes Mr. <HI>Jona|than</HI> makes up his running Accounts to Mr. <HI>Long|man</HI>; who is very &s;crupulous of admitting any body to the U&s;e of his Office, becau&s;e of the Writings in his Cu&s;tody, and the Order he values him&s;elf upon having every thing in.</P>
<P>About Seven in the Evening the young Gentle|man comes again, and I generally, let me have what Company I will, find time to retire for about another Half-hour, and my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> connives at, and excu&s;es my Ab&s;ence, if inquir'd after, tho', for &s;o &s;hort a time, I am &s;eldom mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>To the young Gentleman I &s;hall pre&s;ent, every Quarter, Five Guineas; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pre&s;&s;es him to accept of a Place at his Table, at his Plea&s;ure: But, as we have generally a good deal of Company, his Mode&s;ty makes him decline it, and &s;it down, when he plea&s;es, with Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> who have a &s;eparate Table.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> is &s;o kind as to join with us very often in our <HI>Sunday</HI> Office, and Mr. <HI>Colbrand</HI> &s;el|dom mi&s;&s;es; and they tell Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that they cannot expre&s;s the Plea&s;ure they have to meet me there; and the Edification they receive, as they are &s;o kind to &s;ay, from my Example; and the chearful Temper I am always in, which does 'em good to look upon me: And they will have it, that I do Credit to Religion. But if they do but think &s;o, it mu&s;t have been of Service to me in the Order I have now e&s;tabli&s;hed, as I hope; and that thro' le&s;s Difficulties than I expected to meet with, e&s;pecially from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. I. <HI>p.</HI> 126. Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 346.</NOTE> Cookmaid; but &s;he &s;ays, &s;he comes with double Delight to have the
<PB N="251" REF="256">
Opportunity to &s;ee her beloved Lady, as &s;he calls me, it &s;eems, at every Word.</P>
<P>My be&s;t Beloved di&s;pen&s;es as much as he can with the Servants, for the Evening Part, if he has Com|pany, or will be attended only by <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Abraham,</HI> perhaps, by Turns; and &s;ometimes looks upon his Watch, and &s;ays, 'Tis near Seven; and if he &s;ays &s;o, they take it for a Hint they may be di&s;pens'd with for half an Hour; and this Countenance which the dear Gentleman gives me, has not contributed a little to make the Matter ea&s;y and delightful to me and to every one.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, my dear Mi&s;s, were only Policy to be con&s;idered, this Method mu&s;t be laudable; for &s;ince I have begun it, there is not a more diligent, a more &s;ober, nor more courteous Set of Servants in any Family in a great Way: We have no Broils, no hard Words, no Revilings, no Commandings, nor Com|plainings; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Government is made &s;o ea&s;y, as &s;he &s;ays, that &s;he need not &s;peak twice; and all the Language of the Servants is, Pray, <HI>John,</HI> or Pray, <HI>Jane,</HI> do &s;o or &s;o; and they &s;ay, Their dear Ma&s;ter's Service is a Heaven upon Earth.</P>
<P>When I part from them, on the breaking up of our A&s;&s;embly, they generally make a little Row on each Side to the Hall-door, and when I have made my Com|pliments, and paid my Thanks to Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> one whi|&s;pers, as I go out, God ble&s;s you, Madam! And &s;o &s;ays another, and another, and indeed every one; and bow and court'&s;y with &s;uch Plea&s;ure in their hone&s;t Coun|tenances, as greatly delights me: And I &s;ay, (if it &s;o happens) So, my good Friends!&mdash;I am glad to &s;ee you&mdash;Not one ab&s;ent!&mdash;or but one&mdash;(as it falls out) &mdash;This is very obliging, I cry: And thus I &s;hew them, that I take Notice, if any body be not there. And back again I go to pay my Duty to my Earthly Benefactor; and he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay &s;ometimes, that
<PB N="252" REF="257">
I come to him with &s;uch a Radiance, playing about my Eyes, and &s;hining over my whole Face, as gives him double Plea&s;ure to behold me; and often he tells me afterwards, that, but for appearing too fond be|fore Company, he could meet me, as I enter, with Embraces as pure as my own Heart.</P>
<P>I hope, in time, I &s;hall prevail upon the dear Gen|tleman to give me his Company.&mdash;But, thank God, I am inabled to go thus far already!&mdash;I will leave the re&s;t to his Providence. For I have a Point very de|licate to touch upon in this Particular; and I mu&s;t take care, not to lo&s;e the Ground I have gained, by too precipitately pu&s;hing at too much at once. This is my Comfort, that next to being uniform <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> is that Permi&s;&s;ion and Incouragement he gives <HI>me</HI> to be &s;o, and the Plea&s;ure he takes in &s;eeing me &s;o de|lighted.&mdash;And be&s;ides, the dear Gentleman always gives me his Company to Church. O how happy &s;hould I think my&s;elf, if he would be plea&s;ed to ac|company me to the Divine Office, which yet he has not done, tho' I have urg'd him as much as I dur&s;t! One thing after another, he &s;ays; we &s;hall be better and better, I hope: But nobody is good all at once. But, my dear Mi&s;s, as I con&s;ider this as the Seal of all the re&s;t, and he him&s;elf has an awful Notion of it, I &s;hall hardly think my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Morals fully &s;ecur'd till then.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> ask'd me on <HI>Saturday</HI> Evening, If I would be concerned to &s;ee a larger Congregation in the le&s;&s;er Hall next Morning, than u&s;ual? I &s;aid, No, by no means. She &s;aid, Mrs. <HI>Worden,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> (the two Ladies Women) and Mr. <HI>Sydney,</HI> my Lord <HI>Davers</HI>'s Gentleman, and Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Servant, and the Coachmen and Footmen, belonging to our noble Vi&s;itors, who are, &s;he &s;ays, all great Admirers of our Family Management, and good Order, having been told our Method, begg'd to join in it. I knew I
<PB N="253" REF="258">
&s;hould be a little da&s;h'd at &s;o large a Company; but the Men being pretty orderly, for Lords Servants, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> a&s;&s;uring me, that they were very earne&s;t in their Reque&s;t, I con&s;ented to it.</P>
<P>When, at the u&s;ual Time, (attended by my <HI>Polly</HI>) I went down, I found Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> there, (to whom I made my fir&s;t Compliments) and every one of our own People, waiting for me, Mr. <HI>Colbrand</HI> excepted, (whom Mr. <HI>H.</HI> had kept up late the Night before) together with Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Sydney,</HI> with the Servants of our Gue&s;ts, who, as al&s;o worthy Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> paid me their Re&s;pects; and I &s;aid, This is early ri&s;ing, Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI>; you are very kind to countenance us with your Com|panies in this our Family Order.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Sidney,</HI> I am glad to &s;ee you. How do you&punc; Mr. <HI>Longman?</HI> And looked round with Complacency on the Servants of our noble Vi&s;itors. And then I led Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> to my little Retiring-place, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> and my <HI>Polly</HI> followed, and throwing the Door open, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> began &s;ome &s;elect Prayers; and as the young Gentleman reads with great Empha&s;is) and Propriety, and as if his Heart was in what he read, all the good Folks were exceedingly attentive.</P>
<P>After Prayers, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> read a Meditation, from a Collection made for private U&s;e, which I &s;hall more particularly mention by-and-by; and ending with the u&s;ual Benediction, I thank'd the worthy Gentleman, and reproach'd him, in Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Name, for his Mode&s;ty, in declining our Table; and, thank|ing Mr. <HI>Longman,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Worden,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> receiv'd their kind Wi&s;hes, and ha&s;ten'd, blu&s;hing, thro' their Prai&s;es, to my Chamber, where, being alone, I pur&s;ued the Subject for an Hour, till Break|fa&s;t was ready, when I attended the Ladies, and my
<PB N="254" REF="259">
be&s;t Beloved, who had told them of the Ver&s;es plac'd under my Cu&s;hion at Church.</P>
<P>We &s;et out, my Lord and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and my&s;elf, and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> in our Coach; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and the Counte&s;s, in the Chariot, both Ladies, and the Gentlemen, &s;plendidly dre&s;s'd; but I avoided a Glit|ter as much as I could, that I might not &s;eem to vie with the two Peere&s;&s;es.&mdash;Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, Why are you not full dre&s;s'd, my Dear?&mdash;I &s;aid, I hop'd he would not be di&s;plea&s;ed: If he was, I would do as he com|manded. He an&s;wer'd, As you like be&s;t, my Love. You are a charming Creature in every Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Chariot fir&s;t drawing up to the Church-Door, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> led the Counte&s;s into the Church. My Lord <HI>Davers</HI> did me that Honour; and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> handed his Aunt, thro' a Croud of Gazers, many of whom, as u&s;ual, were Strangers. The Neighbouring Gentle|men and their Ladies paid us their &s;ilent Re&s;pects; but the Thoughts of the wicked Ver&s;es, or rather, as Lady <HI>Davers</HI> will have me &s;ay, wicked Action of the Tran&s;criber of them, made me keep behind in the Pew: But, my Lady, with great Goodne&s;s, &s;at down by me, and whi&s;peringly talked a good deal, between whiles, to me, with great Tenderne&s;s and Freedom in her A&s;pect; which I could not but take kindly, becau&s;e I know &s;he intended by it, to &s;hew every one &s;he was pleas'd with me.</P>
<P>Among other things &s;he &s;aid &s;oftly, Who would wi&s;h to be a King or Queen, <HI>Pamela,</HI> if it is &s;o ea&s;y for Virtue and Beauty (&s;o &s;he was pleas'd to &s;ay) to attract &s;o many &s;incere Admirers, without any of their Grandeur?&mdash;Look round, my dear Girl, and &s;ee what a &s;olemn Re&s;pect, and mingled Delight, appears in every Countenance.</P>
<P>And pre&s;&s;ing my Hand, Thou art a charming Creature; &s;uch a noble Mode&s;ty, and yet &s;uch a be|coming Dignity in thy whole Appearance! No wonder
<PB N="255" REF="260">
that every one's Eyes are upon thee, and that thou bringe&s;t &s;o many booted Gentlemen as well as Neigh|bours, to croud the Church, to behold thee!</P>
<P>Afterwards &s;he was plea&s;ed to add, taking my Hand, (and my dear Gentleman and the Counte&s;s heard her; for &s;he rai&s;ed her Voice to a more audible Whi&s;per) I am proud to be in thy Company; and in this &s;olemn Place, I take thy Hand, and acknow|lege, with Pride, my <HI>Si&s;ter.</HI> I looked down; for here at Church, I can hardly at any time look up; for who can bear to be gaz'd at &s;o?&mdash;And &s;oftly &s;aid, Oh! my good Lady! how much you honour me, the Place, and the&s;e &s;urrounding Eyes, can only hinder me from acknowleging as I ought.</P>
<P>My be&s;t Friend, with Plea&s;ure in his Eyes, &s;aid, pre&s;&s;ing his Hand upon both ours, as my Lady had mine in hers, you are two beloved Creatures: Both excellent in your way. God ble&s;s you both. And you, too, my dear Brother, &s;aid my Lady. The Counte&s;s whi&s;per'd, You &s;hould &s;pare a-body a little! You give one, Ladies, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> too much Plea|&s;ure all at once. Such Company, and &s;uch Beha|viour, adds &s;till more Charms to Devotion; and were I to be here a Twelvemonth, I would never mi&s;s once accompanying You to this good Place.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> thought he mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his noble Uncle, who could not keep his good-natur'd Eye off me, I'll be <HI>hang'd,</HI> my Lord, if I know how to behave my&s;elf!&mdash;Why this outdoes the Chapel!&mdash;I'm glad I put on my new Suit! And then he look'd upon him&s;elf, as if he would &s;upport, as well as he could, his Part of the general Admiration.</P>
<P>But think you not, my dear Mi&s;s, and my deare&s;t Father and Mother, that I am now at the Height of my Happine&s;s in this Life, thus favour'd by Lady <HI>Davers!</HI></P>

<P>Nay, my dear Ladies! &s;aid I; and &s;at down on the fir&s;t Chair.</P>
<P>Nay, my dear <HI>Pamela!</HI> returned my Lady, &s;hew us the Way.</P>

<P>Every one, but <HI>Abraham,</HI> who attended the Gentlemen, and all their Lady&s;hips Servants, and their two Women, and Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Jer|vis,</HI> were there; which pleas'd me, however, be|cau&s;e it &s;hew'd me, that even the Strangers, by this their &s;econd voluntary Attendance, had no ill Opi|nion of the Service. But they were all &s;tartled, ours and theirs, to &s;ee my Ladies accompanying me.</P>
<P>I &s;tept up to Mr. <HI>Adams.</HI>&mdash;I was in hopes, Sir, &s;aid I, we &s;hould have been favour'd with your Company at our Table.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid he, will excu&s;e me: I did not think my&s;elf Company for &s;uch noble Gue&s;ts as were there.</P>
<P>A Gentleman and a Scholar is Company, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, for the fir&s;t Quality.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid I, you &s;ee the Noblene&s;s of the&s;e Ladies. They come now to be obliged to you, for your good Offices; and you'll have no better way of letting them return their Obligation, than to &s;up, tho' you would not dine, with them.</P>

<P>Let us follow you, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid &s;he: We mu&s;t learn of you what we are to do.</P>
<P>I led to the little Clo&s;et, with as much Pre&s;ence of Mind as I could, and my two Ladies followed me; and Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Worden,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> &s;tood ju&s;t without, the Door being half &s;hut, for their Ladies &s;akes.</P>

<P>The Counte&s;s and my Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> delighted to &s;ee &s;uch good Behaviour in every one, &s;at a Moment or two looking upon one another in Silence; and then my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> caught me in her Arms: Be|loved, de&s;ervedly beloved of the kinde&s;t of Hus|bands, what a Ble&s;&s;ing art thou to this Family!</P>
<P>And to every Family, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, who have the Happine&s;s to know, and the Grace to fol|low, her Example! and &s;aluted me too. But where, &s;aid my Lady, collected&s;t thou all this good Sen&s;e, and fine Spirit, in thy Devotions?</P>

<PB N="263" REF="268">
as I hope to have my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s Com|pany and Countenance one Day, in this my delight|ful <HI>Sunday</HI> Imployment.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have added, for I think a good Clergy|man cannot be too much re&s;pected, that I repeated my Reque&s;t to Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> to oblige us with his Company at Supper; but he &s;o very earne&s;tly begg'd to be excu&s;ed, and with &s;o much Concern of Countenance, that I thought it would be wrong to in&s;i&s;t upon it; tho' I was &s;orry for it, becau&s;e I am &s;ure, as of any thing, that Mode&s;ty is always a Sign of Merit.</P>
<P>We return'd to the Gentlemen as &s;oon as Supper was ready, and as chearful and ea&s;y, as Lady <HI>Davers</HI> ob&s;erv'd, as if we had not been pre&s;ent at &s;o &s;olemn a Service; And this, &s;aid &s;he, after the Gentlemen were gone, makes Religion &s;o plea&s;ant and delightful a thing, that I profe&s;s I &s;hall have a much higher Opinion of tho&s;e who make it a regular and con&s;tant Part of their Imployment, than ever I had. But I have &s;een, added her Lady&s;hip, very humorou&s;ly, &s;uch wry Faces, and &s;uch gloomy Countenances, among &s;ome of your pious Folks, in and after a &s;o|lemn Office, that quite di&s;hearten'd me; for I thought, after &s;uch an Exerci&s;e, that it would be a Sin to go to Bed with a Smile upon one's Face, or without &s;ighing and groaning at &s;uch a Rate, as mu&s;t rob one of all the Comforts of Life.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid &s;he, I was once, I remember, when a Girl, at the Hou&s;e of a very devout Man, for a Week, with his Grand-daughter, my School-fellow; and there were &s;uch Preachments again&s;t Vanities, and for Self-denials, that were we to have followed the good Man's Precepts, (tho' indeed not his Practice, for well did he love his Belly) half God Almighty's Creatures and Works would have been u&s;ele&s;s, and Indu&s;try would have been bani&s;h'd the Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="269">There, added her Lady&s;hip, (for &s;he was in a plea&s;ant Vein) have I heard the good Man confe&s;s him&s;elf guilty of &s;uch Sins, that, if true, (and by his hiding his Face with his broad-brim'd Hat, it look'd a little bad again&s;t him) he ought to have been hang'd on a Gallows fifty Foot high.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, that this Over-gloomine&s;s was not Religion, I was per&s;uaded, but Con&s;titution and Mi&s;take; and I was &s;orry always when I met with it; for tho' it might betoken a pious Mind, it certainly &s;hew'd a narrow one, and I fear'd did more Harm than Good.</P>
<P>The&s;e Reflections, as I &s;aid, fell from my Lady, after the Gentlemen were gone, when &s;he recounted to her dear Brother, the Entertainment, as &s;he was pleas'd to call it, I had given her: On which &s;he made high Encomiums, as did the Counte&s;s, and they prai&s;ed al&s;o the natural Dignity which they im|puted to me, &s;aying, I had taught them a way they ne|ver could have found out, to de&s;cend to the Com|pany of Servants, and augment their Re&s;pect and Ve|neration for one at the &s;ame time. And, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid my Lady, you are certainly very right, to pay &s;o much Regard to the young Clergyman; for that makes all he reads, and all he &s;ays, of greater Effi|cacy with the Auditors, facilitates the Work you have in View to bring about, and in your own Ab|&s;ence (for your Monarch may not always di&s;pen&s;e with you perhaps) &s;trengthens his Influences, and encourages the young Gentleman be&s;ides.</P>

<HEAD>MONDAY.</HEAD>
<P>I AM to thank you, my dear Mi&s;s, for your kind Letter, approving of my Scribble <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>XXVIII.</HI> of this Volume.</NOTE>. When you come to my <HI>Saturday</HI>'s and <HI>Sunday</HI>'s Accounts, I
<PB N="265" REF="270">
&s;hall try your Patience. But no more of that; for as you can read them, or let them alone, I am the le&s;s concern'd, e&s;pecially as they will be more indulgently receiv'd &s;omewhere el&s;e, than they may merit; &s;o that my Labour will not be wholly lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I congratulate you with all my Heart, on your di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Mr. <HI>Murray</HI>; for, be&s;ides that &s;ome of his Qualities are not to be approv'd by a Lady of your Ta&s;te and Judgment, I will never give my Con&s;ent, that any Gentleman &s;hall have the Honour of calling my Mi&s;s) <HI>Darnford</HI> his, who can &s;o ea&s;ily re&s;ign his Preten&s;ions to her, and addre&s;s her Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>You are extremely diverting, my dear Mi&s;s, with your Greater and Le&s;&s;er Bear-Stars, and I could not help &s;hewing it to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> And what do you think the free Gentleman &s;aid upon it? I am half afraid to tell you: But do, now you are &s;o happily di&s;|engag'd, get Leave to come, and let us two con|trive to be even with him for it. You are the only Lady in the World, that I would join with again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, That your Characters of Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Nanny,</HI> which he called &s;evere (but I won't call them &s;o, without your Leave) look'd a little like pretty Spite, and as if you were &s;orry the Gentleman took you at your Word.&mdash;That was what he &s;aid&mdash;Pray let us puni&s;h him for it. Yet, he called you charming Lady, and &s;aid a great deal in your Prai&s;e, and join'd with me, that Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> could not po&s;&s;ibly de|&s;erve you, who was &s;o ea&s;y-to part with you.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid he, I know the Sex well enough. Mi&s;s <HI>Polly</HI> may not love Mr. <HI>Murray</HI>; yet to &s;ee her Si&s;ter addre&s;s'd and complimented, and prefer'd to her&s;elf, by one whom &s;he thought &s;o late in her own Power to choo&s;e or to refu&s;e, is a mortifying Thing. And young Ladies cannot bear to &s;it by neglected, while two Lovers are playing Pugs Tricks with one another.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="271">Then, &s;aid he, all the Preparations to Matrimony, the Cloaths to be bought, the Vi&s;its to be paid and received, the Compliments of Friends, the bu&s;y Novelty of the Thing, and the Day to be fixed, and all the little fooli&s;h Humours and Non|&s;en&s;e attending a concluded Court&s;hip, when <HI>one Si&s;ter</HI> is to engro&s;s all the Attention and Regard, the new Equipages, and &s;o forth; the&s;e are all Subjects of Mortification to the <HI>other,</HI> though &s;he had no great Value for the Man perhaps.</P>
<P>Well, but Sir, &s;aid I, a Lady of Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI>'s good Sen&s;e and good Ta&s;te, is not to be affected by the&s;e Parades, and has well con&s;ider'd the Matter, no doubt; and I dare &s;ay, rejoices rather than re|pines at mi&s;&s;ing the Gentleman.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Mi&s;s, had we a Di&s;pute about you. But I hope you will leave the happy Pair, for they are &s;o, if they think them&s;elves &s;o, toge|ther, and Sir <HI>Simon</HI> to rejoice in his accompli&s;h'd Son-in-Law elect, and give us your Company to <HI>London.</HI> For who would &s;tay to be vex'd by that ill-natur'd Mi&s;s <HI>Nanny,</HI> as you own you was, at your la&s;t writing?</P>
<P>But I will proceed with my Journal, and the ra|ther, as I have &s;omething to tell you of a Conver|&s;ation, the Re&s;ult of which has done me great Ho|nour, and given me inexpre&s;&s;ible Delight: Of which in its Place.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s Propo&s;al, returning &s;everal Vi&s;its in one Day; for we have &s;o polite and agree|able a Neighbourhood, that all &s;eem to concur in a De&s;ire to make every thing ea&s;y to one an|other: And, as I mentioned before, hearing Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s Intention to &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> as &s;oon as our noble Gue&s;ts &s;hould leave us, they di&s;pen&s;ed with
<PB N="267" REF="272">
Formalities, being none of them &s;tudious to take things ami&s;s, and having a general good Opinion of one another's Intentions not to di&s;oblige.</P>
<P>We came not home till Ten in the Evening, and then found a Letter directed from Sir <HI>Jacob Swyn|ford,</HI> Uncle by the Half-Blood to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> acquaint|ing him, That hearing his Niece, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> was with him, he would be here in a Day or two, being then upon his Journey, to pay a Vi&s;it to his Nephew and Niece at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This Gentleman is very particularly odd and hu|mour&s;ome, and, his elde&s;t Son being next Heir to the maternal E&s;tate, if Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;hould have no Chil|dren, has been exceedingly di&s;&s;atisfied with his de|ba&s;ing him&s;elf in marrying me; and would have been better plea&s;ed had he not married at all, perhaps.</P>
<P>There never was any cordial Love between Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s Father and him, nor between the Uncle and Nephew and Niece; for his Po&s;itivene&s;s, Roughne&s;s, and Self-intere&s;tedne&s;s too, though very rich, has made him but little agreeable to the ge|nerous Tempers of his Nephew and Niece; yet, when they meet, which is not above once in four or five Years, they are always very civil and oblige|ing to him.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Davers</HI> wonder'd what could bring him hither now; for he lives in <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;el|dom &s;tirs ten Miles from home. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, he was &s;ure it was not to compliment him and me on our Nuptials. No, rather, &s;aid my Lady, to &s;a|tisfy him&s;elf if you are in a way to cut out his own Cubs. Thank God, we are, &s;aid my deare&s;t Friend. Whenever I was &s;tronge&s;t &s;et again&s;t Ma|trimony, the only Rea&s;on I had to weigh again&s;t my
<PB N="268" REF="273">
Di&s;like to the State was, that I was unwilling to leave &s;o large a Part of my E&s;tate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. p. 70.</NOTE> to that Family.</P>
<P>My Dear, &s;aid he to me, don't be unea&s;y; but you'll &s;ee a Relation of mine much more di&s;|agreeable than you can imagine: But no doubt you have heard his Character.</P>
<P>Ah, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> we are a Family that value our&s;elves upon our Ance&s;try; but upon my Word, Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> and all his Line, have nothing el&s;e to boa&s;t of. And I have been often a&s;hamed of my Relation to them.</P>
<P>No Family, I believe, my Lady, has every Body excellent in it, reply'd I: But I doubt I &s;hall &s;tand but poorly with Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>He won't dare to affront you, my Dear, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> although he'll &s;ay to you, and me, and my Si&s;ter too, blunt and rough things. But he'll not &s;tay above a Day or two, and we &s;hall not &s;ee him again for &s;ome Years to come; &s;o we'll bear with him. I am now coming to the Conver&s;ation I hinted at.</P>

<HEAD>TUESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> came to pay his Re|&s;pects to his kind Patron. I had been to pay a Vi&s;it to the Widow Gentlewoman I mentioned be|fore, and on my Return, went directly to my Clo|&s;et, &s;o knew not of his being there till I came down to Dinner; for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and he, were near two Hours together in Di&s;cour&s;e in the Library.</P>
<P>When I came down, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pre&s;ented him to me. My Friend Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> my Dear, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> how do you do, &s;aid I? I am glad to &s;ee you.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="274">He rejoiced, he &s;aid, to &s;ee me look &s;o well; and had long'd for an Opportunity to pay his Re|&s;pects to his worthy Patron and me before: But had been prevented twice when he was upon the Point of &s;etting out.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, I have prevail'd upon my old Ac|quaintance to take up his Re&s;idence with us, while he &s;tays in the&s;e Parts. Do you, my Dear, &s;ee that every thing is made agreeable to him.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Sir, I will.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> being in the Hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;ent to de&s;ire he would dine with us; if it were but in re&s;pect to a Gentleman of the &s;ame Cloth, who gave us his Company. And with great Mode&s;ty he came. But neither of the Gentlemen knew how to &s;peak at fir&s;t, before Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> who is &s;o maje&s;tick a Lady, and has &s;o maje&s;tick a Character too, that every one has an Awe upon them in her Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> when Dinner was over, and the Servants were withdrawn, &s;aid, My Dear, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s in Part, was to a&s;k my Advice as to a Living that is offer'd him, by the Earl of&mdash;, who is greatly taken with his Preaching and Conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>And to quit yours, I pre&s;ume, Sir, &s;aid Lord <HI>Davers?</HI></P>
<P>No, the Earl's is not quite &s;o good as mine, and his Lord&s;hip would procure him a Di&s;pen&s;ation to hold both. What would you advi&s;e, my Dear?</P>
<P>It becomes not me, Sir, &s;aid I, to meddle with &s;uch Matters as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Yes, my Dear, it does, when I a&s;k your Opi|nion.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="275">I beg Pardon, Sir, &s;aid I.&mdash;My Opinion then is, That Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> will not care to do any thing that <HI>requires</HI> a Di&s;pen&s;ation, and which would be unlawful without it.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> &s;peaks ex|ceedingly well.</P>
<P>I am glad, Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> &s;aid I, that you approve of my Sentiments. You &s;ee they were required of me by one who has a Right to command me in every thing; otherwi&s;e this Matter is above my Sphere; and I have &s;o much good Will to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> that I wi&s;h him every thing that will con|tribute to make him happy.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> but what would you advi&s;e in this Ca&s;e? The Earl propo&s;es, that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s pre&s;ent Living be &s;upply'd by a Cu|rate; to whom, no doubt, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> will be very genteel; and, as we are &s;eldom or never there, his Lord&s;hip thinks we &s;hall not be di&s;pleas'd with it, and in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that he will propo&s;e it to me; as he has done.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Davers</HI> &s;aid, I think this may do very well, Brother. But, what pray, Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> do you propo&s;e to allow to your Curate? Excu&s;e me, Sir; but I think the Clergy do &s;o hardly by one ano|ther generally, that they are not to be &s;urpriz'd that &s;ome of the Laity treat them as they do.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>H.</HI> that's well ob&s;erved; for I have heard it &s;aid twenty and twenty times, If you would know how to value a Clergyman, and what he de&s;erves for &s;pending his whole Life in the Duties of his Function, you need but form your Opi|nion upon the Treatment they give to one another; and 40 or 50 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, would be thought too much, even for him who does all the Labour.</P>

<P>Oh, &s;aid my Lady, No Wonder! This is <HI>Jackey</HI>'s Peculiar. He has always &s;omething to &s;ay again&s;t the Clergy. For he never lov'd them, be|cau&s;e his Tutors were Clergymen; and &s;ince, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip (very &s;everely) he never got any Good from them, why &s;hould they expect any from him?</P>
<P>Always hard upon my poor Nephew, &s;aid Lord <HI>Davers.</HI></P>
<P>Thank you, Aunt, &s;aid Mr. <HI>H.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;aid, Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation was but too true; that nothing gave greater Cau&s;e of Scan|dal than the U&s;age &s;ome even of the dignified Clergy gave their Brethren: That he had always lamented it, as one of the greate&s;t Cau&s;es of the Contempt with which the Clergy are too generally treated.</P>
<P>He was proceeding; but Lady <HI>Davers</HI> &s;aid, I am not at all &s;urpriz'd at their Treatment of one another; for if a Gentleman of Education and Learning can &s;o far forget what belongs to his Function, as to accept of Two Livings, when One would afford him a hand&s;ome Maintenance, it is no wonder that &s;uch a one would make the mo&s;t of it; for does he not as good as declare, that he takes it for that very Purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not let this Argument proceed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> without clearing my worthy Friend. He is under no Difficulty about holding the Two. He pro|po&s;es <HI>not</HI> to do it; and, like a good Man, as I al|ways thought him, is of Opinion he <HI>ought not</HI> to do it. But here is his Difficulty, and all his Dif|ficulty; He is very de&s;irous to oblige his good Friend the Earl, who is very pre&s;&s;ing to have him
<PB N="272" REF="277">
near him; but apprehending that I may take it ami&s;s, if he relinqui&s;hes my Living, he came to a&s;k my Advice; and after we had talked a good deal of the Matter, I told him we would refer it to Pamela, who was a kind of Ca&s;ui&s;t in &s;uch Matters of Equity and good Order as fell within the Compa&s;s of her Ob&s;ervation and Capacity: And &s;o, my Dear, &s;aid he, give us your free Opinion; for this is a Subject you have &s;poken your Mind to me upon once before.</P>
<P>I am very glad, Sir, replied I, that Mr. <HI>Wil|liams</HI>'s own Re&s;olution was &s;o conformable to what I wi&s;h'd it to be, and indeed expected from his Character; and I can more freely &s;peak my Mind upon the Occa&s;ion, though I am but a poor Ca&s;ui&s;t neither.</P>
<P>You remember, my Dear, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> what you ob&s;erved to me in favour of the Clergy and their Maintenance, when we fell occa&s;ionally upon that Subject a while ago. I found you had con|&s;idered the Point, and thought you &s;poke well upon the Subject. Let us hear your Opinion now upon it.</P>
<P>Indeed, reply'd I, I &s;ay now, as I then took the Liberty to &s;ay, that I have &s;o general a Good-will for the Function, that if my Wi&s;hes could have Effect, there is not one of it, but &s;hould have a hand&s;ome Competency; at lea&s;t &s;uch a one as to &s;et him above Contempt. And this, I am per|&s;uaded would be a great Furtherance to the Good we expect from them, in teaching the lower Rank of People (as well as the higher) their Duties, and making them good Servants, and u&s;eful Members of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="278">But, my Dear, you took Notice of &s;ome things, that would, if you can recollect them, be very <HI>aprop&ograve;s</HI> to the Subject we are now upon.</P>
<P>I remember, Sir, &s;aid I, we were talking of Impropriations. I took the Liberty to expre&s;s my|&s;elf a little earne&s;tly again&s;t Impropriations; and I remember you &s;topped my Mouth at once upon that Head.</P>
<P>As how, Si&s;ter, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers?</HI>&mdash;Ay, as how, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid the Counte&s;s?</P>
<P>Why, Madam, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that when the Clergy would come into a Regulation for the more equal and u&s;eful Di&s;po&s;ition of the Re|venues that at pre&s;ent were in the Church, he would be the fir&s;t that would bring in a Bill for re&s;toring to it all that it had lo&s;t by Impropriations and other Secularizations, and leave it upon the Publick to make Satisfaction to &s;uch of the Laity as would be Sufferers by the Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>That was not, my Dear, what I meant, re|turned Mr. <HI>B.</HI> You was particularly again&s;t Di&s;|pen&s;ations; which is the Point before us now.</P>
<P>I remember, Sir, I did &s;ay, that as there are &s;o many Gentlemen of the Function, who have no Provi&s;ion at all, I could not wi&s;h any one of it &s;hould hold Two Livings; e&s;pecially, if they cannot perform the Duties of both, and where One would afford a tolerable Competence. Much le&s;s (I re|member I took the Liberty to add) could I think it excu&s;able, that a Gentleman &s;hould rate the La|bours of his Brother, who does <HI>every</HI> thing, &s;o low, as is too frequently the Ca&s;e, and pay him&s;elf &s;o well, for doing <HI>nothing</HI> at all.</P>
<P>This is what I mean, returned Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and I thought you ob&s;erved very well, my Dear. For
<PB N="274" REF="279">
my own Part, I have always been of Opinion, that the Clergy who do thus, make the be&s;t Excu&s;e that can be made for Impropriators and Lay-Patrons. For here is a Gentleman the Son of a Layman (I &s;peak to general Ca&s;es) is &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity, and takes Orders. He has Intere&s;t perhaps to get two or more Livings, and hires a Per&s;on, who is as de&s;erving as him&s;elf, but de&s;titute of Friends, at a low Rate, to do the Duties of one of them. We will &s;uppo&s;e in his Favour, that he has &s;everal Children to provide for out of the&s;e, and makes that his Pretence for oppre&s;&s;ing the Per&s;on he em|ploys to do his own Duty. Some of the&s;e Chil|dren are Males, &s;ome Females, and not one in five of the former is brought up to the Church; and all that he &s;aves for them, and gives them, out of what he &s;queezes from his unhappy Brother, is it not &s;ecu|larizing, as it were, at lea&s;t as far as he can do it, the Revenues appropriated to the Church? And can <HI>he,</HI> whatever others may, blame an Impropri|ator for applying that Portion of the Produce of Church-Lands to <HI>his</HI> Lay-Family, which the other intends for the Lay-Family he is endeavouring to build up? Some one or two of which Impropriator's Sons may po&s;&s;ibly too, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Living in their Father's Gift, be brought up to the Church? What is the Difference, I would fain know?</P>
<P>If the Clergy were always to have done thus, continued Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;hould we not have wanted many Endowments and charitable Foundations, which we now have? And I am verry &s;orry to have Rea|&s;on to &s;ay, that we owe &s;uch Sort of Works more to the Piety of the Clergy of pa&s;t Times than the pre|&s;ent; for now, let us ca&s;t our Eye upon the Practices of &s;ome of our Prelates; for who is it that looks not
<PB N="275" REF="280">
up fir&s;t for Examples to that venerable Order? And we &s;hall find that too many among them, &s;eem more intent upon making a Family, as it is called, and thereby &s;ecularizing, as I ob&s;erved, as much as they can, the Revenues of the Church, than to live up either to the ancient Ho&s;pitality, or with a View to tho&s;e Acts of Munificence, which were the Rea&s;on for endowing the Church with &s;uch ample Revenues, as it once had, and &s;till has, were it not &s;o unequally di&s;tributed, and in &s;o few Hands.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, &s;aid I, what a &s;ad Hard&s;hip do the inferior Clergy labour under all this Time?&mdash; To be oppre&s;&s;ed and kept down by their Brethren and the Laity too? This is hard indeed&mdash;'Tis pity, methinks, this, at lea&s;t, could not be remedied.</P>
<P>It will hardly ever be done, my Dear. The Evil lies deep; 'tis in human Nature, and when that can be mended, it will be better; but I &s;ee not how it can be expected, while tho&s;e who have mo&s;t Influence to procure the Redre&s;s, are mo&s;t intere&s;ted to prevent it: And the Views of others, a&s;piring to the &s;ame Power and Intere&s;t, make too many wi&s;h to have things left as they are; although they have no pre&s;ent Benefit by it. And tho&s;e would join in a Cry of the Church's Danger, were the Legi&s;lature to offer at a Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>'Tis pity, Sir, &s;aid I, the Convocation are not permitted to &s;it. They would, perhaps, undertake this Province, and &s;everal others for the Benefit of the whole Body of the Clergy; and I &s;hould think &s;uch Regulations would come be&s;t from them.</P>
<P>So it is, my Dear, would they employ them|&s;elves and their Deliberations in &s;uch good Works. But 'tis a &s;ad Thing to con&s;ider, that there is little Good to be expected from Bodies of Men in
<PB N="276" REF="281">
general; for altho' an Individual cares not to pull down upon him&s;elf the Odium of a bad or unpopu|lar Action, yet when there are many to &s;hare it among them, I &s;ee not that they &s;tand upon it. But far be it from me to &s;ay this with a View to Convocations <HI>as</HI> Convocations. I &s;peak what is but too generally the Ca&s;e in all Bodies of Men what|ever, whether Clergy or Laity. And let us look into the greater or le&s;&s;er Corporations and Societies throughout the Kingdom, and you'll find, if you ex|cu&s;e a poor Witici&s;m, that Bodies are really <HI>Bodies,</HI> and act too often as if they had no <HI>Souls</HI> among them.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, that when you judge thus hardly of Bodies, you include the two &s;upreme Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>Thou &s;halt not,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;I know the&s;e Re|verend Gentlemen (looking at Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>) will tell me, <HI>&s;peak Evil of the Ru|lers of thy People.</HI>&mdash;But I wi&s;h I could always defend, what I am loth at any time to cen&s;ure. But were you to read, or attend to the Debates in both Hou&s;es, which &s;ometimes happen in Ca&s;es al|mo&s;t &s;elf-evident, you would find it impo&s;&s;ible not to regret, that you are now and then under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to join with the Minority; as well in your Hou&s;e, Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> as in ours.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h Brother, reply'd his Lord&s;hip, I could differ from you with Rea&s;on: But this always <HI>was,</HI> and, I fear, always <HI>will be</HI> &s;o, more or le&s;s in every Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, to return to our fir&s;t Subject, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> You know, my Dear, how much Plea&s;ure I take to hear your Opinion in Ca&s;es of natural Equity: And you mu&s;t tell us freely, what you would advi&s;e your Friend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> to do.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="282">And mu&s;t I, Sir, &s;peak my Mind before &s;o many Better Judges?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, (a Name &s;he is now plea&s;ed to give me freely before Strangers, after her dear Brother's Example, who is kinde&s;t, tho' always kind, at &s;uch Times) you <HI>mu&s;t</HI>; if I may be allow'd to &s;ay <HI>mu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Why then, &s;aid I, I beg leave to ask Mr. <HI>Wil|liams</HI> one Que&s;tion; that is, Whether his pre&s;ent Pari&s;hioners do not re&s;pect and e&s;teem him, in that particular Manner, which I think every Body mu&s;t, who knows his Worth?</P>
<P>I am very happy, Madam, in the Good-Will of all my Pari&s;hioners, and have great Acknowlege|ments to make for their Civilities to me.</P>
<P>I don't doubt, &s;aid I, but it will be the &s;ame where-ever you go; for, bad as the World is, a pru|dent and good Clergyman will never fail of Re&s;pect. But, Sir, if you think your Mini&s;try among them is attended with good Effects; if they e&s;teem your Per&s;on with a Preference, and li&s;ten to your Doc|trines with Attention; methinks, for <HI>their</HI> Sakes, 'tis pity to leave them, were the Living of <HI>le&s;s</HI> Value, as it is of <HI>more</HI> than the other. For how many People are there who can benefit by one Gentle|man's Preaching, rather than another's; altho', po&s;|&s;ibly, the one's Abilities may be no way inferior to the other's? There is a great deal in a <HI>Delivery,</HI> as it is called, in a Way, a Manner, a Deport|ment, to engage People's Attention and E&s;teem; and as you are already in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their E&s;teem, you are &s;ure to do much of the Good you aim and wi&s;h to do. For where the Flock loves the Shep|herd, all his Work is ea&s;y, and more than half done; and without that, let him have the Tongue
<PB N="278" REF="283">
of an Angel, and let him live the Life of a Saint, he will be heard with Indifference, and, oftentimes, as his Subject may be, with Di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed here, but every one being &s;ilent, As to the Earl's Friend&s;hip, Sir, continued I, you are be&s;t Judge what Force that ought to have upon you; and what I have mention'd wou'd be the only Dif|ficulty with me, were I in Mr. <HI>William</HI>'s Ca&s;e. To be &s;ure it will be an high Obligation upon his Lord|&s;hip, and &s;o he ought to think it, that you quit a better Living to oblige him. And he will be bound in Honour to make it up to you. For I am far from thinking, that a prudent Regard to worldly Intere&s;t misbecomes the Character of a good Clergy|man; and I wi&s;h all &s;uch were &s;et above the World, for their own Sakes, as well as for the Sakes of their Hearers, &s;ince Independency gives a Man Re&s;pect, be&s;ides the Power of doing Good, which will inhance that Re&s;pect, &s;trengthen his Influ|ences, and, of con&s;equence, give greater Efficacy to his Doctrines.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s mentioned hereupon, the Saying of Dr. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> who was beheaded in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. becau&s;e he would not own the King's Supremacy: This Prelate being offer'd a richer Bi&s;hoprick, he would not accept of it, &s;ay|ing,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He looked upon his Bi&s;hoprick as his Wife, and he &s;hould not think it excu&s;able to part with his Wife becau&s;e &s;he was poor."</Q>
This brought &s;o many Reflections upon the frequent Tran&s;lations, and the Earne&s;tne&s;s with which richer Bi&s;hopricks were &s;ought after, that I was very &s;orry to hear, or think there was Occa&s;ion for them. And I did take the Liberty to &s;ay, that, as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had ob|&s;erv'd,
<PB N="279" REF="284">
the Fault was in human Nature; and tho' it was an inexcu&s;able one, perhaps we that cen|&s;ur'd them, might find it hard, in their Circum|&s;tances, to re&s;i&s;t the Temptation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, He wi&s;h'd, for the Sake of the Clergy in general, that there was a Law again&s;t Tran&s;la|tions; and that all the Bi&s;hopricks in <HI>England,</HI> were made equal in Revenue: For, do we not &s;ee, &s;aid he, that the Prelates, almo&s;t to a Man, vote with Power? And, by this means, contribute not a little to make them&s;elves and the whole Body of a Clergy, &s;o numerous, and &s;o de&s;erving too, as that of the Church of England, a By-word to Free-thinkers of all Denominations, who are ever ready to take Occa&s;ion to malign them and their venerable Order.</P>
<P>Would you not, a&s;ked Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> have the two Primacies di&s;tingui&s;hed in Revenue?</P>
<P>No, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Di&s;tinction of Dignity and Precedence would be enough, if not too much; for where there is but one Pope, the whole College of Cardinals, Seventy in Number, are always look|ing up to, and gaping after the Chair: And I would have no Temptations laid in the Way of good Men to forfeit their Characters, and weaken their Influences, which are of &s;o much Con&s;equence for Example-&s;ake, to the Publick Weal.</P>
<P>I think, &s;aid Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> there was &s;ome Rea|&s;on for the Celibacy of the Clergy in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church at fir&s;t; altho' the Inconveniencies ari&s;ing from it, are too many, and too obvious, to wi&s;h the Re&s;traint &s;o general. For the Provi&s;ion for Fa|milies and Children, furni&s;hes &s;o natural and &s;o laudable a Pretence to a Clergyman to lay up all he
<PB N="280" REF="285">
can for them, that their Characters &s;uffer not a little on that Account.</P>
<P>If we look round us, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and &s;ee how many good and worthy Families are &s;prung from the Clergy; and look abroad, and &s;ee what are too often the Effects of Celibacy in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and the Scandal, wor&s;e than what we complain of, ever thrown upon them, even by Bigots of their own Communion, we &s;hall have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to condemn the Celibacy which that Church en|joins. Be&s;ides, a bad Mind, an oppre&s;&s;ive or co|vetous Nature, will be the &s;ame, whether marry'd or &s;ingle: For have we not &s;een to what a &s;can|dalous Heighth Nepoti&s;m has been carried in that Church? And has not a Pope of a private and narrow Spirit, done as much for his Nephews and Nieces (and perhaps nearer Relations under tho&s;e Names) as he could have done for his Sons and Daughters? So &s;till <HI>here</HI> too, we mu&s;t re&s;olve all into that com|mon Sewer of Iniquity, Human Nature; and con|clude, That a truly good Man will not do a bad Thing upon any the neare&s;t and mo&s;t affecting Con&s;iderations; and that a bad Man will never want a Pretence to di&s;play his evil Qualities, nor Flat|terers neither (if he has Power) to defend him, for the wor&s;t he can do.</P>
<P>I well remember the Argument, when I was at <HI>Rome,</HI> u&s;ed to the Pope, on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion. His Holine&s;s declar'd again&s;t Nepoti&s;m, &s;aying, That he would never look upon the Revenues of the Church, as the Patrimony of his private Family; and forbad his numerous Relations, who, on his Pro|motion, &s;warm'd about him, with Faces as hungry, as if they were &s;o many <HI>North-Britons,</HI> travelling Southward for Preferment&mdash;(that was Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s
<PB N="281" REF="286">
Word, &s;poken plea&s;antly) to think of him in any other Light, than that of the common Father of all his People; and as having no other Relation but Merit.</P>
<P>This was &s;etting out well, you'll &s;ay; but what was the Event?&mdash;Why, two thirds of his Relations ru&s;hed into Orders directly; and it was not long, before Para&s;ites were found, to repre&s;ent to the Holy Father, that it was a Sin, to deprive the Church of &s;o many excellent Props and Buttre&s;&s;es; and that for the Good of the Publick, he ought to prefer them to the fir&s;t Dignities; &s;o, that the good Man, overcome with their Rea&s;ons, and loth to continue in &s;o great a Sin, grac'd the Cardinalate with one, the Epi&s;copate with half a Dozen; and the riche&s;t Abbacies with a Score or two; and the Emperor having occa&s;ion to make Intere&s;t with his Holine&s;s, found Merit enough in &s;ome of the Lay-Relations, to create them Princes and Counts of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But, Sir, &s;aid I, (for I am always &s;orry to hear things &s;aid to the Di&s;credit of the Clergy, becau&s;e I think it is of publick Concern that we venerate the Function, tho' not the Failings of Particulars); have I not been a &s;ilent Witne&s;s, that you have made the &s;ame Ob&s;ervations on a Mini&s;ter of State, who, tho' he &s;hall be perhaps the fir&s;t to blame this Di&s;po&s;ition in a Clergyman, will be equally ready to practi&s;e it him&s;elf, to Relations and Children, full as worthle&s;s, to the Exclu&s;ion of the Worthy? &mdash;So that, Sir, this is all Human Nature &s;till; and &s;hould we not be tender in our Cen&s;ures of the one, when we are &s;o ready to acquit the other?</P>
<P>There's this Difference, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid the Coun|te&s;s: From the one we expect a better Example;
<PB N="282" REF="287">
from the other, no Example fit to be followed. And this is one Rea&s;on that makes a Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter generally &s;o hated a Thing, becau&s;e he re&s;olves all Con&s;iderations into Self, and is beloved by no Body, but tho&s;e, to whom he gives the Overflowings of &s;uch Benefits as he has not Relations enough to heap them upon.</P>
<P>Well, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> &s;aid I, if I may be allow'd to be &s;o &s;erious, does not this &s;hew the Excellency of the Prayer we are taught by the &s;upreme Teacher, and that Part of it, <HI>Lead us not into Temptation?</HI>&mdash;For it &s;eems too natural a Con&s;equence, that no &s;ooner are we tempted, but we <HI>deliver up our &s;elves to Evil.</HI>&mdash;Right, Si&s;ter, &s;aid Lord <HI>Davers</HI>; and this ends in Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s <HI>human Nature</HI> again.</P>
<P>What remains then, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> but that we take the World as we find it? Give Prai&s;e to the Good, Di&s;prai&s;e to the Bad; and every one try to mend <HI>one?</HI></P>
<P>Yet I wi&s;h, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;o over-tender are many good Clergymen of the Failings they would not be guilty of, in their Brethren, that we &s;hould avoid di&s;plea&s;ing them, if they were to know the Free|dom of this Conver&s;ation, tho' we are all &s;o well-di&s;po&s;ed to reverence their Function.</P>
<P>I hope otherwi&s;e, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>; for it is but giving <HI>due</HI> Prai&s;e and Di&s;prai&s;e, as my Lady &s;ays; and were evil Actions to go uncen&s;ur'd, good ones would lo&s;e their Reward, and Vice by being put upon a Foot with Virtue in this Life, would meet with too much Countenance.</P>
<P>But give me leave, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> to inter|po&s;e a little in the Matter we have departed from, that of the Curate and Di&s;pen&s;ation; and when I have deliver'd my Sentiments, I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that
<PB N="283" REF="288">
Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> will as freely give us hers, as if I had been &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Di&s;pen&s;ations are u&s;ual Things. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> may pay a young Gentleman hand&s;omely; and the Cen&s;ure we have pa&s;s'd, is only upon &s;uch as do not. To a young Man at fir&s;t &s;etting out, a good Curacy will be very acceptable. If he has Merit, it will put him in a Way of &s;hewing it, and he may rai&s;e him&s;elf by it. If he has not, he will not de&s;erve more. And Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> may marry, per|haps, and have a Family to provide for. His Op|portunities may not always be the &s;ame: The Earl may die, and he &s;hould be excu&s;ed to make the be&s;t U&s;e of his Intere&s;t and Favour, for the very Rea&s;on Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> gave, that, as he is a good Man, it will &s;trengthen his Influences: And, come, Brother, you know I am always for pre&s;cribing! Here is a worthy young Gentleman in our Eye, that won't take it ami&s;s to begin with a Curacy: And you &s;hall give <HI>your</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, previous to the legal one, on Condition, that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> will permit you to pre&s;ent his Curate; and thus all will be &s;olv'd.</P>
<P>Both the Gentlemen bow'd&mdash;and Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> was going to &s;peak: But Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, Take my Si&s;ter at her Word, <HI>Pamela,</HI> and if you have any thing to &s;ay to this Scheme, &s;peak it freely, as if her Lady&s;hip had been &s;ilent; for, I perceive, by your downca&s;t Eye, and Silence, you could &s;ay &s;ome|thing, if you would.</P>
<P>Ay, pray do, &s;aid my Lady. I love to hear you &s;peak. You always make me think of &s;omething I had not con&s;ider'd before.</P>
<P>I am very loth to &s;ay anything on &s;o nice a Subject. Indeed it would not become me. There is &s;o much

Genero&s;ity and Benevolence in my good Lady's Scheme, that I ought not.</P>
<P><HI>Ought not!</HI> &s;aid my deare&s;t Friend, interrupting me, None of your <HI>ought nots</HI>; I know you are al|ways forming in your Mind Notions of Right and Wrong, in the common Ca&s;es of Life. Let us therefore have your Opinion in this Matter more fully than you have hitherto given it, and deliver it too without He&s;itation, and with that Ea&s;e and Freedom, that are born with you; for I can tell you, that when, thro' the Corruptions of Human Nature, we lo&s;e the Di&s;tinction of Right and Wrong, I know not where we can better apply our&s;elves, than to &s;uch as you, to recover them.</P>
<P>I bow'd, and &s;aid, If you will have it &s;o, Sir, it mu&s;t be &s;o; and I will then be&s;peak all your kind Allowances, ca&s;ting my Eye around me, to each, and tell you all I think upon this Matter; and when I have done, &s;ubmit my poor Sentiments, as becomes me, to your &s;uperior Judgments.</P>
<P>Thus then I would &s;ay&mdash;Pardon me, my Lady, for taking your Lady&s;hip's Words for my Theme, as I remember them; and hardly any thing falls from your Lady&s;hip that I do not remember&mdash; <HI>That Di&s;pen&s;ations are u&s;ual Things.</HI>&mdash;I am &s;ure, I am going to di&s;play my Ignorance, becau&s;e, know|ing nothing of their Original or De&s;ign, I mu&s;t pre&s;ume them to be very ancient in this Kingdom, and introduced only when there were fewer Cler|gymen than Benefices. Was there ever &s;uch a Time?</P>
<P>They &s;mil'd&mdash;Nay, now, you would command me, Sir, to &s;peak, when I needed to do nothing el&s;e to expo&s;e my &s;elf. There was a Time, as I have read, that there were &s;o few Scholars, that the
<PB N="285" REF="290">
Benefit of Clergy was allow'd to &s;ome &s;ort of Cri|minals who could do no more than read, becau&s;e the Commonwealth could &s;o ill &s;pare learned Men. &mdash;And might not there be a Time then, when Di&s;pen&s;ations were allowed to worthy Men, becau&s;e it was difficult to find enow of &s;uch as de&s;erv'd that Character, to fill the Church Preferments?</P>
<P>Tell us, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> whether you do not intend this as a Satire upon the Practice, or is it really your pretty Ignorance, that has made you pronounce one of the &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ures upon it, that could be thought of?</P>
<P>I &s;miled, and &s;aid, Indeed, Sir, I think only &s;ome &s;uch Rea&s;on, or a wor&s;e, mu&s;t be the Original of Di&s;pen&s;ations; for is it right that one Gentleman &s;hall have two or three Livings, the Duties of no more than one of which he can per&s;onally attend, while &s;o many are de&s;titute of Bread, almo&s;t, and expo&s;ed to Contempt, the too frequent Companion of Poverty? And what though Cu&s;tom may have &s;anctified it, to be &s;ure that is all that can; and a good Man will not do all he may do, without in|curring a Penalty, becau&s;e there is in every thing a Right and a Wrong; and becau&s;e, be the Cu&s;tom what it will, a Man &s;hould regulate his Actions by his Con&s;cience and the Golden Rule.</P>
<P>My good Lady &s;ays, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> may pay a Gentleman hand&s;omely: I don't doubt but Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> would; and this, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, would be doing what is not &s;o often done as one would wi&s;h. But may I be permitted to a&s;k, For <HI>what</HI> would he pay the Gentleman hand&s;omely?&mdash;Why for doing that Duty for him, which in Con&s;cience and Honour he ought to do him&s;elf, and which, when he takes In&s;titu|tion
<PB N="286" REF="291">
and Induction, he engages &s;olemnly to do? And pray, excu&s;e me, my Dear Every-body&mdash; that was my fooli&s;h Word, which made them &s;mile&mdash;To what End is all this?&mdash;Only, that the Gentleman who does all the Labour in the Vine|yard, &s;hall live upon 30, 40, or 50<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> more or le&s;s, while the Gentleman who has <HI>be&s;t</HI> nothing but <HI>be&s;t</HI> Intere&s;t, (another of my fooli&s;h Phra&s;es) &s;hall receive twice, and perhaps three times the Sum for doing nothing at all. Can any Di&s;pen&s;ation, my dear Friends, make this a ju&s;t or equitable thing? Indeed if the Living be &s;o poor, as too many of them are, that a Man cannot com|fortably and creditably &s;ub&s;i&s;t without putting Two poor ones together to make One tolerable one, that is another Thing. But pray now, my good Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> excu&s;e me, if Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> can live on a Curacy of 40 or 50<HI>l.</HI> a Year, cannot another Gentleman live, unle&s;s his Rectory or Vicarage bring him 2 or 300? Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> may marry as well as Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>; and both, I believe, will find God's Providence a better Reliance, than the riche&s;t Benefice in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A good Curacy, no doubt, continued I, may be a comfortable thing at &s;etting out to a young Gentleman: But if here be a Rectory or Vicarage, of 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year for Example, (for if it be of no more Value than a good Curacy, he mu&s;t be content) is not that 200<HI>l.</HI> a Year the Reward for doing &s;uch and &s;uch Labour? And if this be the &s;tated Hire for this Labour, to &s;peak in the Scripture Phra&s;e, <HI>is not the Labourer worthy of his Hire?</HI> Or is he that does <HI>not</HI> labour to go away with the greate&s;t Part of it?</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="292">If the Gentleman, my Lady is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, has Merit, this Curacy may put him in the way of &s;hewing it. But does the Manife&s;tation of Merit, and the Reward of it always go together?&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lady is &s;o good as to ob&s;erve:&mdash;But may I, Madam, be excu&s;ed?&mdash;</P>
<P>Proceed, proceed, Child!&mdash;I &s;hall only have a Care of what I &s;ay before you for the future, that's all.</P>
<P>And I too, &s;aid Mr. <HI>H.</HI>&mdash; which made them &s;mile.</P>
<P>Nay, now, my Lady.&mdash;</P>
<P>Proceed, I tell you&mdash;I only wonder, as my Bro|ther has &s;aid, on another Occa&s;ion, where thou gotte&s;t all the&s;e equitable Notions.</P>
<P>My Lady is &s;o good as to ob&s;erve, proceeded I, (for they were plea&s;ed to be attentive) that Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;hould make u&s;e of his Opportunities. I know her Lady&s;hip &s;peaks this rather in generous Indulgence to the u&s;ual Practice, than what always ought to be the chief Con&s;ideration; for if the Earl &s;hould die, may not &s;ome other Friend ari&s;e to a Gentleman of Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Merit?</P>
<P>As to &s;trengthning of a good Man's Influence, which is a Point always to be wi&s;h'd, I would not &s;ay &s;o much as I have done, if I had not heard Mr. <HI>Longman</HI> &s;ay, and I am &s;ure I heard it with great Plea&s;ure, that the Benefice Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;o worthily enjoys, is a clear 250 <HI>l.</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>But after all, does Happine&s;s to a Gentleman, a Scholar, a Philo&s;opher, re&s;t in a greater or le&s;&s;er Income?&mdash;Does it not rather re&s;t in a happy Com|petency, or Mediocrity? Suppo&s;e my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year added to his pre&s;ent large Income, would that increa&s;e his Happine&s;s! That
<PB N="288" REF="293">
it would add to his Cares, is no Que&s;tion; but could that Addition give him one &s;ingle Comfort which he has not already? And if the dear Gentleman had 2 or 3000 le&s;s, might he be le&s;s happy on that Account? No, &s;urely, for it would render a greater Prudence on my humble Part nece&s;&s;ary, and a nearer In&s;pection and greater Frugality on his own; and he mu&s;t be contented (if he did not, as now, perhaps, lay up every Year) &s;o long as he lived within his Income&mdash;And who will &s;ay, that the Obligation to greater Prudence, and Oeco|nomy, is a Mi&s;fortune?</P>
<P>The Competency, therefore, the Golden Mean, is the Thing; and I have often con&s;idered the Matter, and endeavoured to &s;quare my Actions by that Con&s;ideration. For a Per&s;on (I have this No|tion, dear Sir, from that Manu&s;cript Poem you was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, of not preferring People above their native Condition, and which has been an ex|cellent Le&s;&s;on to me: For a Per&s;on, I was going to &s;ay) who being not born to an E&s;tate, is not &s;ati&s;|fied with a Competency, will know no Limits to his De&s;ires. Such a one that an Acqui&s;ition of 100 or 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year will not &s;atisfy, will not &s;it down contented with any Sum. Although he may propo&s;e to him&s;elf at a Di&s;tance, that &s;uch and &s;uch an Acqui&s;ition will be the Height of his Am|bition; yet he will, as he approaches to that, ad|vance upon him&s;elf farther and farther&mdash;and know no Bounds, till the natural one is forced upon him, and his Life and his Views end together.</P>
<P>Now let me humbly beg Pardon of you all, Ladies and Gentlemen, &s;aid I, turning my Eye to each; but mo&s;t of you, my good Lady, who&s;e Ob&s;ervations I have made &s;o free with. If <HI>you</HI> can
<PB N="289" REF="293">
forgive me, it will be an In&s;tance of your Good|ne&s;s, that I may hope for, but hardly can expect. Will you, my dear Lady, &s;aid I, and laid my Hand upon her Lady&s;hip's, in a &s;upplicatory Man|ner; for &s;he &s;at next me?</P>
<P>I think <HI>not,</HI> &s;aid her Lady&s;hip. I think I <HI>ought</HI> not.&mdash;Should I, Brother? Can I, my Lord?&mdash; Ought I, my Lady Counte&s;s?&mdash;Brother, Brother, if you have been in any Degree contributing to the Excellency of this&mdash;what &s;hall I call her? How cunningly do you act, to make her imbibe your Notions, and then utter them with &s;uch Advantage, that you have the &s;ecret Pride to find your own Sentiments prai&s;ed from her Mouth? But I will forgive you both, he it as it will; for I am &s;ure, outdone as I am, in Thought, Word, and Deed, and by &s;o young a Gyp&s;ey&mdash;that was her Word; it is by one that would outdo every body el&s;e, as well as me; only I would except your Lady|&s;hip&mdash;None of your Exceptions, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> re|ply'd the Counte&s;s&mdash;I know not, in &s;o young a Lady, whether I &s;hould mo&s;t envy or admire her Ex|cellence.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;ince I have the Plea&s;ure, &s;aid I, to find my&s;elf forgiven, may I be indulged a few Mo|ments Prattle more? only ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the State of the Ca&s;e I have given, is but one Side of the Que&s;tion; that which a good Clergyman, in my humble Opinion, would chu&s;e to act. But when we come to the other Side, what it would be kind we of the Laity &s;hould think and act by them, that is another thing. For when we think of the Hard&s;hips the Clergy lie under, more than almo&s;t any other Body of Men, we &s;hall &s;ee they are intitled to better U&s;age than they often meet with.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="295">Here, in the fir&s;t Place, a Youth is &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity, after a painful Cour&s;e to qualify him for it. He endangers his Health, and impairs his Con&s;titution by hard Study, and a &s;edentary Life; and after he has pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a Number of Years, he is admitted into Orders, perhaps gets a &s;mall Fel|low&s;hip, turns Tutor, a painful Imployment, and his Education having been de&s;igned for all his Portion, and that expended in it, he at la&s;t, by Intere&s;t or Favour, gets a Curacy or little Living of 40, 50, or 60 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; if le&s;s, &s;o much the wor&s;e; and is obliged to maintain him&s;elf in a genteel Appearance out of that, and be &s;ubject not &s;eldom to the Je&s;ts of Buffoons and Rakes at a great Man's Table, where the <HI>Par&s;on</HI> is too often the Butt to receive the &s;up|po&s;ed witty Shafts of &s;uch as can allow them&s;elves to &s;ay any thing. If he marries, which po&s;&s;ibly too he is kept from, contrary to his Wi&s;hes, of all Men he is the lea&s;t to follow his own Liking; &s;ince Prudence too often obliges him to take the Per&s;on his Inclination would not.</P>
<P>If Children follow, what melancholy Views has he of providing for them, did not his &s;trong Re|liance on Providence exerci&s;e his Faith again&s;t worldly Appearance?</P>
<P>Then has he too often to contend for his Dues, the Produce of his poor Income, with churli&s;h and ignorant Spirits, whom his Function would make him wi&s;h to &s;mooth and in&s;truct; who, though they farm and pay to the Landlord for no more than nine Tenths of the Lands they occupy, hardly think it a Sin to cheat the Par&s;on of his Tythe; who, however, has the &s;ame Right to it by the Laws of the Land, as the Gentleman has to the E&s;tate, or the Tenant to the Produce of his Farm.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="296">This obliges the poor Gentleman to live in a State of War among a People with whom both his Duty and Inclination would make him de&s;irous to cultivate a good Under&s;tanding.

<P>In the next Place, I pre&s;ume to think, that the Clergy are too much looked upon by &s;ome as a detached Body, as I may &s;ay, from the re&s;t of the People, and as Per&s;ons acting upon a &s;eparate In|tere&s;t quite oppo&s;ite to that of the Laity: When, po&s;&s;ibly, that very Churl, who refu&s;es them their Right, or would cheat them of it, has a View to bring up one of his Family to the Church, and hopes to get him provided for out of its Revenues. And are not the Clergy, moreover, the Fathers, the Sons, the Uncles, the Brothers of the Laity, who &s;hall &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t their Maintenance? And mu&s;t their Education debar them of tho&s;e Comforts, which it better qualifies them to enjoy, and which it incapacitates them any other way to procure?</P>
<P>What Opportunity have not the Laity in general, of all Degrees and Ranks, to make their Lives ea&s;y and happy, to what the Clergy have? Here is a middling Family, with three or four Sons: Sup|po&s;e the Father's Circum&s;tances will allow him to bring up one to the <HI>Law:</HI> What Opportunities has <HI>he,</HI> unenvied, to make a Fortune? Another is brought up to <HI>Trade:</HI> If he has but tolerable Succe&s;s in the World, in what Ea&s;e and Affluence does he &s;up|port him&s;elf, and provide for his Family? The
<PB N="292" REF="297">
<HI>Phy&s;ick Line,</HI> what Fortunes are not rai&s;ed in that? And no body envies any of the&s;e. But the Son, who&s;e Inclination &s;hall lead him perhaps <HI>be&s;t</HI> to de|&s;erve, and <HI>mo&s;t</HI> to require, an ea&s;y and comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence, and who ought wholly to appropriate him&s;elf to the Duties of his Function, is grudged, envied, and treated as if he were not a Son of the &s;ame Family, and had not a natural Right and Stake in the &s;ame Commonwealth.</P>
<P>There are, 'tis true, Preferments, and &s;ome great ones, and Honours too, in the Church; but how few, compared to the Numbers of the Clergy, or to tho&s;e Livings which are &s;o poor as can hardly &s;et a Man above Penury and Contempt?&mdash;And how are tho&s;e few ingro&s;s'd by the De&s;cendants or Dependants of the Rich and Powerful? And, what by Commendams, Di&s;pen&s;ations, and &s;uch-like Contrivances, how does one Man of Intere&s;t and Addre&s;s &s;wallow up the Provi&s;ion which was de|&s;igned for &s;everal, as de&s;erving, perhaps, at lea&s;t, as him&s;elf?&mdash;For, my good Lady, (you have for|given me, and mu&s;t not be di&s;plea&s;ed) a Gentle|man's Friends <HI>may die off,</HI> and he mu&s;t, you know, <HI>make the be&s;t U&s;e of his Opportunities.</HI></P>
<P>O you dear Sauce-box, as my Brother calls you!&mdash;How dare you, by that arch pretty Look, triumph over me thus?&mdash;Let me, Brother, give her a Slap for this!&mdash;I'm &s;ure &s;he de&s;erves it.</P>
<P>I think &s;he is a little in&s;olent indeed, Lady <HI>Davers.</HI> &mdash; But to the Ca&s;e in Hand. There is &s;o much Truth in what <HI>Pamela</HI> &s;ays, of the Hard&s;hips to which the Clergy, the inferior Clergy particu|larly, are &s;ubjected, that I wonder any Gentleman who can chu&s;e for him&s;elf, and has no probable
<PB N="293" REF="298">
Pro&s;pects, &s;hould enter into Orders, under &s;uch Di&s;couragements.</P>
<P>I humbly conceive, Sir, &s;aid I, that there can be but one <HI>good</HI> Inducement, and that is what the Apo&s;tle hints at in the Words &mdash; <HI>If in</HI> this Life <HI>only we have Hope, we are of all Men mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</HI></P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;o much as this is their Motive, &s;o much are they intitled to that better Hope; and may that better Hope never deceive them!</P>
<P>But I have the Plea&s;ure to acquaint this Company, that I had a mind only to hear what <HI>Pamela,</HI> who, as I hinted, talked to me learnedly on this very Subject a few Days ago, would &s;ay, when &s;he came Face to Face, to her two worthy Friends, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> (and &s;o I de&s;ired Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> would let her run on, if I could &s;et her into the Subject)&mdash;el&s;e my old Ac|quaintance was re&s;olved not to hold both Livings, &s;ince <HI>either,</HI> he was &s;o good as to &s;ay, would afford him as hand&s;ome a Provi&s;ion, as he wi&s;hed for; his only Difficulty being about obliging the Earl, or whether he &s;hould not di&s;oblige me, if he complied with that Nobleman's Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> this is the very Ca&s;e; and after what I have heard from your Lady&s;hip, (&s;o he call'd me) I would not, for the World, have been of another Mind, nor have put it upon any other Foot than I did.</P>
<P>You are a good Gentleman, &s;aid I; and I have &s;uch an Opinion of your Worthine&s;s, and the Credit you do your Character, that I would &s;ooner &s;u&s;pect my own Judgment, and &s;o I ought, than yours. But pray, Sir, what, may I a&s;k? have you determined to do?</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="299">Why, Madam, reply'd he, I am &s;tagger'd in that too, by the Ob&s;ervation your Lady&s;hip made, that where a Man has the Love of his Pari&s;hioners, he ought not to think of leaving them.</P>
<P>El&s;e, Sir, I find, you had rather inclined to ob|lige the Earl, though the Living be of <HI>le&s;s</HI> Value! This is very noble, Sir; it is more than generous.</P>
<P>My Dear, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I'll tell you (for Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Mode&s;ty will not let him &s;peak it before all the Company) what <HI>is</HI> his Motive, and a worthy one you'll &s;ay it is. Excu&s;e me, Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>&mdash; (for the reverend Gentleman blu&s;h'd).</P>
<P>The Earl has of late Years&mdash;we all know his Character&mdash;given him&s;elf up to Carou&s;ing, and he will &s;uffer no Man to go from his Table &s;ober. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> has taken the Liberty to expo&s;tulate, as became his Function, with his Lord&s;hip on this Subject, and upon &s;ome other Irregularities, in &s;o agreeable a manner, that the Earl has taken a great Liking to him, and promi&s;es, that he will &s;uffer his Rea&s;onings to have an Effect upon him, and that he &s;hall reform his whole Hou&s;hold, if he will come and live near him, and regulate his Table by his own Example.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s is a very good Lady, and privately pre&s;&s;es Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> to oblige the Earl: And this is our worthy Friend's main Inducement; with the Hope, which I &s;hould not forget to mention, that he has, of pre&s;erving untainted the Morals of the two young Gentlemen, the Earl's Sons, who, he fears, will be carried away by the Force of &s;uch an Example: And he thinks, as the Earl's Living has fallen, mine, probably, will be better &s;upplied than the Earl's, if he, as he kindly offers, gives it me back again; otherwi&s;e the Earl, as he apprehends,
<PB N="295" REF="300">
will find out for his, &s;ome Gentleman, if &s;uch an one can be found, as will rather further, than ob|&s;truct his own Irregularities; as was the unhappy Ca&s;e of the la&s;t Incumbent.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and &s;o &s;aid the Counte&s;s, we &s;hall always have the highe&s;t Re&s;pect for Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> for a Conduct &s;o genteel and &s;o pru|dent. But, Brother, will you, and will you, Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> put this whole Affair, in all its Parts, into Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Hands, &s;ince you have &s;uch Te&s;timo|nies, <HI>both</HI> of you, of her Rectitude of Thinking and Acting?</P>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam, replied Mr. <HI>Wil|liams</HI>; and I &s;hall be proud of &s;uch a Direction.</P>
<P>What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> Brother? You are to &s;uppo&s;e the Living in your own Hands again; will you leave the whole Matter to my <HI>Si&s;ter</HI> here?</P>
<P>Come, my Dear, &s;ays Mr. <HI>B.</HI> let us hear how you'd wi&s;h it to be order'd. I know you have not need of one Moment's Con&s;ideration, when once you are Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Point.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> that is not the Thing. I repeat my Demand: Shall it be as Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> lays it out, or not?</P>
<P>This is a weighty Matter, my good Si&s;ter; and bad as I have been, I think Patrons are accountable, in a great mea&s;ure, for the Characters of the Per&s;ons they pre&s;ent; and I do a&s;&s;ure you, that had I twenty Livings in my Gift, I &s;hould think I ought not to prefer my Brother to any one of them, if his Morals and Character were not likely to do Honour to the Church, as well as to my Pre&s;entation. And I expected to hear from <HI>Pamela,</HI> when &s;he was enumerating the Hard&s;hips of the Clergy, of that &s;candalous Practice of &s;ome Patrons, who rob the
<PB N="296" REF="301">
regularly-bred Clergymen, by pu&s;hing into Orders &s;ome Kin&s;man, or Friend, or Friend's Kin&s;man or Friend, when a Living falls in, let his Character or Qualifications be ever &s;o faulty and defective. I could name you &s;everal &s;uch In&s;tances, that ought to make the Ordainers, as well as the Ordained, <HI>blu&s;h</HI>; as (were I to borrow one of <HI>Pamela</HI>'s &s;erious Infer|ences, I would &s;ay) it will one Day make them both <HI>tremble,</HI> when they come to give an Account of the Tru&s;ts committed to them.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays my Lady, I have a noble Brother, that's true. What Pity you ever were wicked at all! But, come, and laid her Hand upon mine, this &s;ame good Girl will be a Ble&s;&s;ing to you: Nay, why &s;ay I, <HI>will</HI> be? &s;he <HI>is</HI>; and the greate&s;t that mortal Man can receive.&mdash; But &s;till I mu&s;t have you put this Mat|ter into Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Hands.</P>
<P>Conditionally I will &mdash; Provided I cannot give &s;atisfactory Rea&s;ons, why I <HI>ought not</HI> to conform to her Opinion; for this, as I &s;aid, is a Point of Con|&s;cience with me; and I made it &s;o, when I pre&s;ented Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> to the Living; and have not been de|ceived in that Pre&s;entation.</P>

<P>I know well, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> added Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Power your Sex have over ours, and their &s;ubtle Tricks; and &s;o will never be drawn in, in my weake&s;t Moments, to make a blindfold Promi&s;e.

<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid I, with your <HI>requi&s;ite</HI> Condition in my Eye, I will. But let me &s;ee, that I &s;tate the Matter right. And preparative to it, pray, Mr. <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> tho' you have not been long in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Living, yet may-be you can compute what it is likely, by what you know of it, to bring in, clear?</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid he, by the be&s;t Calculation I can make, (I thank you for it, good Sir) it may, one Year with another, be reckoned at 300 l. <HI>per Annum:</HI> It is the be&s;t Living within twenty Miles of it, having been improved within the&s;e two la&s;t Years.</P>

<P>Well then, reply'd I, very pertly, I believe now I have it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> for Motives mo&s;t excellently wor|thy of his Function, inclines to &s;urrender up to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> his Living of 300 l. <HI>per Annum,</HI> and to accept of the Earl's Living of 220 l. <HI>per Annum.</HI> Dear Sir, I am going to be very bold; but under <HI>your</HI> Condition neverthele&s;s:&mdash;Let the Gentleman to whom you &s;hall pre&s;ent the Living of <HI>F.</HI> allow 80 l. <HI>per Annum</HI> out of it to Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> till the Earl's Favour &s;hall make up the Difference to him, and no longer.&mdash;And&mdash;but I dare not name the Gentle|man: &mdash;For how, dear Sir, were I to be &s;o bold, &s;hall I part with my Chaplain?</P>
<P>Admirable! mo&s;t admirable! &s;aid Lord and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> in the &s;ame Words. The Counte&s;s prai&s;ed the Deci&s;ion too; and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> with his Let me be hang'd, and his 'Fore Gads,&mdash;and &s;uch Exclama|tions natural to him, made <HI>his</HI> Plaudits.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="303">Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;aid, He could wi&s;h with all his Heart it might be &s;o; and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> was &s;o aba&s;h'd and &s;urpris'd, he could not hold up his Head;&mdash;but Joy danced in his &s;ilent Countenance for all that.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> having he&s;itated a few Minutes, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> called out for his Objection, or Con&s;ent, according to Condition; and he &s;aid, I cannot &s;o &s;oon determine as that prompt Slut did. I'll withdraw one Minute.</P>
<P>He did &s;o, as I found afterwards, to advi&s;e, like the con&s;iderate and genteel Spirit he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, with Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> whom he beckon'd out, and to exa|mine whether he was in Earne&s;t willing to give it up, or had any body he was very de&s;irous &s;hould &s;ucceed him; telling him, that, if he had, he thought him|&s;elf oblig'd, in Return for his worthy Behaviour to him, to pay a particular Regard to his Recommend|ation.

Dear my Ladies, if he be &s;o, plead for me, and I will withdraw, when he comes in; for I cannot &s;tand his Anger: I have not been u&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>Never fear, you charming <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid my Lady, he can't be angry at any thing you &s;ay or do. But I wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of what I have been Witne&s;s to of Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Behaviour and Mode&s;ty, that &s;uch a thing could be done for him.</P>

<P>This affected me a good deal, as it did all the Company; but I was &s;till more affected, when Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, Here, my Dear, thank good Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> for inabling you to give &s;uch a &s;hining Proof of your Excellence: And remember, that whenever I put any Power into your Hands for the future, you keep this happy In&s;tance in Mind, and in every thing that offers, I &s;hall then have no Will nor Choice but yours.</P>

<P>My dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> delighted with every Occa&s;ion that makes for my Honour, and to endear me to his beloved Si&s;ter, &s;aid, Take care then of my Jewel, and let her dear Face adorn the Bo&s;om of a Lady I

love next to her&s;elf. And ri&s;ing, went into the great Parlour.</P>
<P>I would have &s;tood up; but, quite aba&s;hed at my recollected Behaviour before &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es, and confounded with the Goodne&s;s of &s;uch a Brother and &s;uch a Si&s;ter, my Feet were unwilling to &s;upport me. And my dear Lady <HI>Davers</HI> (O Mi&s;s, what a happy <HI>Pamela</HI> is your Friend! what a happy Daughter, my dear Father and Mother!) &mdash; cla&s;ped me in her Arms, and to her Bo&s;om, and ki&s;&s;ed me five or &s;ix times, running over with Expre&s;&s;ions of Favour and Good|ne&s;s, in a Style and Words I cannot repeat: For &s;he is Mi&s;tre&s;s of a flowery Rhetorick, and has &s;uch a charming Gift of Utterance, that could I but half equal her, when &s;he thus loftily &s;oars, I &s;hould de|&s;erve the Compliments &s;he made me.</P>
<P>Coffee being ready, Lady <HI>Davers</HI> led me to the great withdrawing Room, and we were join'd by all the Company, and Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> too; and my Lord <HI>Davers</HI> was plea&s;ed to make me &s;everal fine Compli|ments, and &s;o did Mr. <HI>H.</HI> after his Manner. But the Counte&s;s exceeded <HI>her&s;elf</HI> in Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;eemed &s;o plea&s;ed, and &s;o elated with the de&s;erved Acceptation his worthy Conduct had met with, that it &s;hew'd he was far from repenting at the generous Turn the Matter had taken in favour of Mr. <HI>Adams:</HI> On the contrary, he congratulated him upon it, telling him, he would introduce him, when his generous Patron thought proper, to his new Pari&s;hioners, and would read Prayers for him at his fir&s;t Preaching. And I think, Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> &s;aid he, &s;ince this happy Affair has been brought about from the Conver&s;ation upon Di&s;pen&s;ations, you and I, both by our Examples and our Arguments, mu&s;t, on all Occa&s;ions, di&s;credit that Practice; &s;ince, as my Lady has ob&s;erved, God's Providence is a better Reliance than the riche&s;t Benefice in <HI>England</HI>; and

&s;ince, as her Lady&s;hip has al&s;o ob&s;erved, we ought not to look beyond a happy Competency, as if in <HI>this Life only we had Hope.</HI></P>
<P>My Lady, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> has given me many Le&s;&s;ons, relating to different Parts of my Duty, both as a Chri&s;tian and a Clergyman, that will not only furni&s;h me with Rules for my future Conduct, but with Subjects for the be&s;t Sermons I &s;hall ever be able to compo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, It is a Rule with me, not to leave till To-morrow what can be done To-day: And when, my Dear, do you propo&s;e to di&s;|pen&s;e with Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s good Offices in your Fa|mily? Or did you intend to induce him to go to Town with us?</P>
<P>I had not propo&s;ed any thing, Sir, as to that; for I had not asked your kind Direction: But the good Dean will &s;upply us, I doubt not; and when we &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> will be at full Liberty, with his worthy Friend Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> to pur&s;ue the happy Scheme, which your Goodne&s;s has permited to take Effect.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> my Dear, who came la&s;t from the Univer&s;ity, can perhaps recommend &s;uch another young Gentleman as him&s;elf, for your Dome&s;tick Duties.</P>
<P>I looked, it &s;eems, a little grave, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid, What have you to offer, <HI>Pamela?</HI> What have I &s;aid ami&s;s?</P>
<P>Ami&s;s! dear Sir!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ay, and dear Madam, too! I &s;ee by your ba&s;hful Seriou&s;ne&s;s, in place of that &s;miling Approbation which you always &s;hew when I utter any thing you <HI>intirely</HI> approve, that I have &s;aid &s;omething which would rather meet with your Acquie&s;cence, than Choice. So, as I have often told you, none of your Re&s;erves! And never <HI>he&s;itate</HI> to me your Con|&s;ent
<PB N="303" REF="308">
in any thing, while you are &s;ure, I will conform to your Wi&s;hes, or pur&s;ue my own Liking, as <HI>either</HI> &s;hall appear rea&s;onable to me, when I have heard <HI>your</HI> Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Why then, dear Sir, what I had pre&s;umed to think, but I &s;ubmit it to your better Judgment, was, Whe|ther, as the Gentleman who is &s;o kind as to direct our Family Duties, in &s;ome mea&s;ure acts in the Pro|vince of the worthy Dean, it were not right, that our own Pari&s;h Mini&s;ter, whether here or at <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould name, or at lea&s;t approve <HI>our</HI> naming, the Gentleman?</P>
<P>Why could not I have thought of that, as well as you, Sauce-box? Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> I'm intirely on your Side. I think &s;he de&s;erves a Slap now for us both.</P>
<P>I'll forgive her, &s;aid my Lady, &s;ince I find her Sen|timents and Actions as much a Reproach to others as to me.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams,</HI> did you ever think, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> it would have come to this? Did you ever know &s;uch a &s;aucy Girl in your Life? &mdash; Already to give her&s;elf the&s;e reproaching Airs?</P>
<P>No, never, if your Honour is plea&s;ed to call the mo&s;t excellent Lady in the World by &s;uch a Name, nor any body el&s;e!</P>
<P><HI>Pamela,</HI> I charge you, &s;aid the dear Gentleman, if you <HI>&s;tudy</HI> for it, be &s;ometimes in the Wrong, that one may not always be taking Le&s;&s;ons from &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance; but, in our Turns, have &s;omething to teach <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>Then, dear Sir, &s;aid I, mu&s;t I not be a &s;trange Creature? For how, when you, and my good Ladies, are continually giving me &s;uch charming Examples, can I do a wrong thing?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;aid, Let him <HI>be hang'd,</HI> if he would not marry, as &s;oon as ever he could get any body to have him.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="309">Fooli&s;h Fellow! &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> do'&s;t think that thou'lt meet with &s;uch a Wife as that, when thou marrye&s;t?</P>

<P>There's not the Reproach in thy An&s;wer that thou intende&s;t, except to thy own grinning In&s;olence, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, (&s;evere enough, but &s;miling) that makes thee think <HI>that</HI> a Reflection, that is none in this Ca&s;e.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WEDNESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>Towards the Evening came Sir <HI>Jacob Swynford,</HI> on Hor&s;eback, attended by two Servants in Liveries. I was abroad; for I had got Leave for a whole After|noon, attended by my <HI>Polly,</HI> which Time I pa&s;&s;ed in vi&s;iting no le&s;s than four &s;everal poor &s;ick Fa|milies, who&s;e Hearts I made glad. But I &s;hould be too tedious, were I to give you the Particulars; and be&s;ides, I have a brief Li&s;t of Ca&s;es, which, when
<PB N="306" REF="311">
you'll favour me with your Company, I may &s;hew you; for I have obliged my&s;elf <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 353.</NOTE>, tho' not de&s;ired, to keep an Account of what I do with no le&s;s than 200 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, that my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> allows me to ex|pend in Acts of Charity and Benevolence.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Davers</HI> told me afterwards, that Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> carried it mighty &s;tiff and formal, when he alighted. He &s;trutted about the Court-yard in his Boots, with his Whip in his Hand; and tho' her Lady&s;hip went to the great Door, in order to welcome him, he turn'd &s;hort, and, whi&s;tling, followed the Groom into the Stable, as if he had been at an Inn, only, in&s;tead of taking off his Hat, pulling its broad Brim over his Eyes, for a Compliment. In &s;he went in a Pet, as &s;he &s;ays, &s;aying to the Counte&s;s, A &s;urly Brute he always was! <HI>My</HI> Uncle! He's more of an Ho&s;tler than a Gentleman: I'm re&s;olv'd I'll not &s;tir to meet him again. And yet the Wretch loves Re&s;pect from others, tho' he never practi&s;es common Civility him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;aid, She was glad he was come; for &s;he lov'd to divert her&s;elf with &s;uch odd Cha|racters now-and-then.</P>
<P>And now let me give you a &s;hort De&s;cription of him as I found him, when I came in, that you may the better conceive what &s;ort of a Gentleman he is.</P>
<P>He is about Sixty-five Years of Age, a coar&s;e, &s;trong, big-bon'd Gentleman, with large irregular Features; he has a haughty &s;upercilious Look, a &s;waggering Gait, and a Per&s;on not at all be&s;peaking one's Favour in behalf of his Mind; and his Mind, as you &s;hall hear by-and-by, not clearing up tho&s;e Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in his Di&s;favour, with which his Per&s;on and Features at fir&s;t impre&s;s one. His Voice is big and &s;urly; his Eyes little and fiery; his Mouth large,
<PB N="307" REF="312">
with what Teeth he has left, ground down, as it &s;eem'd, even with his many-colour'd Gums, as if by con&s;tant U&s;e. But with all the&s;e Imperfections, he has an Air that &s;ets him &s;omewhat above the mere Vulgar, and &s;uch as makes one think, that half his Di&s;advantages are rather owing to his own haughty Humour, than to Nature: For he &s;eems to be a perfect Tyrant at fir&s;t Sight, a Man u&s;ed to pre&s;cribe, and not to be pre&s;cribed to; and has the Advantage of a &s;hrewd penetrating Look, which yet, methinks, &s;eems rather acquired than natural.</P>
<P>After he had &s;een his Hor&s;es well &s;erv'd, and put on an old-fa&s;hion'd Gold-button'd Coat, which by its Fre&s;hne&s;s &s;hew'd he had been very chary of it, a better Wig, but in &s;tiff Buckle, and a long Sword, &s;tuck &s;tiffly, as if thro' his Coat Lappets; in he came, and with an imperious Air entering the Parlour, What, nobody come to meet me! &s;aid he; and &s;a|luting her Lady&s;hip, How do you do, Niece? and look'd about haughtily, &s;he &s;ays, as if he expected to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>My Lady, pre&s;enting the Counte&s;s, &s;aid, The Counte&s;s of <HI>C.</HI> Sir <HI>Jacob!</HI>&mdash;O, cry Mercy! &s;aid he &mdash;Your mo&s;t obedient humble Servant, Madam; I hope his Lord&s;hip is well.</P>
<P>At your Service, Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h he was, &s;aid he, bluntly; he &s;hould not have voted as he did la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, I can tell you that.</P>
<P>Why, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>Servants</HI> don't always, in this free Kingdom, do as their <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> would have 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Mine</HI> do, I can tell you that, Madam.</P>
<P>Right or Wrong, Sir <HI>Jacob?</HI></P>
<P>It can't be wrong, if I command them.</P>
<P>Why, truly, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> there's many a private Gentleman carries it higher to a Servant, than he
<PB N="308" REF="313">
cares his <HI>Prince</HI> &s;hould to him: But I thought, till now, 'twas the King only could do no wrong.</P>

<P>Your Lady&s;hip &s;hould &s;pare me: I'm but ju&s;t come off a Journey. Let me turn my&s;elf about, and I'll be up with you, never fear, Madam. But where's my Nephew, Lady <HI>Davers?</HI> And where's your Lord?

<P>My Brother, and Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> are all rid out together.</P>
<P>Well, Niece, &s;trutting, with his Hands behind him, and his Head held up&punc;&mdash;Ha!&mdash;He has made a fine Kettle on't,&mdash;han't he!&mdash;'Sblood, (that was his profligate Word) that ever &s;uch a Rake &s;hould be &s;o caught!&mdash;They tell me, &s;he's plaguy cunning, and quite &s;mart and hand&s;ome.&mdash;But I wi&s;h his Fa|ther were but living.&mdash;Yet what could he have done?

<P>Yes, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> reply'd my Lady, I do; and you'll not &s;cruple to do &s;o too, when you &s;ee her.</P>
<P>Why, thou countenance&s;t him in his Folly, Child; I'd a better Opinion of thy Spirit! Thou married to a Lord, and thy Brother to a&mdash;Can&s;t tell me what, <HI>Barbara?</HI> If thou can&s;t, pr'ythee do.</P>

<P>What, do&s;t think I &s;hall look thro' <HI>his</HI> fooli&s;h Eyes?&mdash;What a Di&s;grace to a Family ancienter than the Conque&s;t!&mdash;O <HI>Tempora!</HI> O <HI>Mores!</HI> What will this World come to!</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="314">The Counte&s;s was diverted with this odd Gentle|man, but run on in my Prai&s;e, for fear he &s;hould &s;ay &s;ome rude things to me when I came in, and Lady <HI>Davers</HI> &s;econded her. But all, it &s;eems, &s;ignify'd nothing. He would tell us both his Mind, let the young Whelp, that was his Word, take it as he would. And pray, &s;aid he, can't I &s;ee this fine Body before he comes in? Let me but turn her round two of three times, and ask her a Que&s;tion or two; and by her An&s;wers I &s;hall know what to think of her in a Twinkling.</P>
<P>She is gone to take a little Airing, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> and won't be back till Supper-time.</P>
<P>Supper-time! Why, &s;he is not to &s;it down at Table, is &s;he? If &s;he does, I won't; that's po&s;itive. &mdash;But now you talk of Supper, what have you?&mdash; I mu&s;t have a boil'd Chicken, and &s;hall eat it all my|&s;elf. &mdash; Who's Hou&s;e-keeper now?

<P>No, there is not one new Servant, except a Girl that waits upon her own Per&s;on: All the old Ser|vants are continued.</P>
<P>That's much! the&s;e Creatures generally take as great State upon 'em as a born Lady: And they're in the right. If they can make the Man &s;toop to the great Point, they'll hold his No&s;e to the Grind&s;tone, never fear; and all the little ones come about in cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> when you &s;ee her, you'll alter your Mind.</P>
<P>Never, never; that's po&s;itive.</P>
<P>Ay, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> I was as po&s;itive as you once; but I love her now as well as if &s;he was my own Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>O hideous, hideous!&mdash;Tell it not in <HI>Gath</HI>; for thou'lt make the Daughters of <HI>Phili&s;tia</HI> triumph! All the Fools that he has made where-ever he has travelled, will clap their Hands at him, and at you too, if you

<P>O yes, &s;aid my Lady, my Brother will, I dare &s;ay. He de&s;pi&s;es this &s;urly Brute too much to be angry at him, let him &s;ay what he will.</P>

<P>I mention all the&s;e things, as the Ladies afterwards told them to me, becau&s;e it &s;hall prepare you to judge what a fine Time I was likely to have of it.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> came home, which they did about half an Hour after Six, they were told who was there, ju&s;t as they entered the Parlour; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;miled at Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> and entering,&mdash;Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;aid he, Welcome to <HI>Bedford|&s;hire!</HI> And thrice Welcome to this Hou&s;e!

<P>What then?&mdash;Why, then, thou would&s;t have done ju&s;t as thou ha&s;t done!</P>
<P>Come, come, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> you know not my In|ducements. You know not what an Angel I have in Per&s;on and Mind. Your Eyes &s;hall by-and-by be ble&s;t with the Sight of her: Your Ears with hear|ing her &s;peak:&mdash;And then you'll call all you have &s;aid, Profanation.</P>

<P>The Devil!&mdash;I'm in an inchanted Ca&s;tle, that's certain. What a Plague has this little Witch done to you all!&mdash;And how did &s;he bring it about?</P>
<P>The Ladies and Lord <HI>Davers</HI> laugh'd, it &s;eems, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> begging him to &s;it down, and an&s;wer him &s;ome Family Que&s;tions, he &s;aid, (for it &s;eems he is very captious at times) What, a Devil! am I to be

<P>With me, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>H.</HI> I'd give all I'm worth in the World, and ever &s;hall be worth, for &s;uch another Wife.</P>

<P>By my Soul, &s;aid he, I was running; for I thought it was the grand Inchantre&s;s.</P>

<P>Ah! but Madam, &s;aid I, Lady <HI>Jenny</HI> is not mar|ry'd&mdash;looking (before I thought) on a Circum&s;tance that I think too much of &s;ometimes, tho' I carry it off as well as I can.</P>
<P>She laugh'd at my Exception: Come, Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, (for I ju&s;t then enter'd the great Door) I hope you've had a fine Airing?</P>

<P>Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> look'd as if he did not know what to think of it, now at me, now at Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash; But the dear Gentleman put him quite out of Doubt, by taking my Hand: Well, Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> did you meet my Fugitive in your Tour?</P>
<P>No, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid I. Did &s;he go my Way? I told you I would keep the great Road.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Jenny C</HI>&mdash;, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> pre&s;enting me to his Uncle. A charming Creature! added the dear Gen|tleman: Have you never a Son worthy of &s;uch an Alliance?</P>

Why, the Plague, whi&s;per'd he, could you not have pitch'd your Tent here?&mdash;Mi&s;s, by your Leave: And &s;aluting me, turn'd to the Counte&s;s: By my Soul, Madam, you've a charming Daughter! Had my ra&s;h Ne|phew &s;een this lovely Creature, and you'd have con|de&s;cended, he'd never have &s;toop'd to the Cottage, as he has done.</P>
<P>You're right, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> return'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI>; but I always ran too fa&s;t for my Fortune: Yet, the&s;e La|dies of Family never bring out their Jewels into Batchelors Company; and when, too late, we &s;ee what we've mi&s;s'd, we are vex'd at our Precipita|tion.</P>
<P>Well &s;aid, however, Boy. By my Soul, I wi&s;h thee Repentance, tho' 'tis out of thy Power to amend. Be that one of thy Cur&s;es, when thou &s;ee&s;t this Lady; as I make no doubt it is.</P>

<P>After Breakfa&s;t, and the Servants were withdrawn, Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> you are a young Lady who have all the Advantages of Birth and De|&s;cent, and &s;ome of the be&s;t Blood in the Kingdom runs in your Veins; and here Sir <HI>Jacob Swynford</HI> is your great Admirer: Cannot <HI>you,</HI> from whom it will come with a double Grace, convince him, that he does an unkind thing, at my Brother's Hou&s;e, to keep the Per&s;on my Brother has thought worthy of making the Mi&s;tre&s;s of it, out of Company?

<P>Why how now, Lady <HI>Davers!</HI> This from you! I did not expect it!</P>
<P>My Uncle, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is the only Per&s;on in the Kingdom that I would have humoured thus: And I made no doubt, when he &s;aw how willing I was to oblige him in &s;o high a Point, he would have acted a more generous Part than he has yet done. But, Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> what &s;ay you to my Si&s;ter's Que&s;tions?</P>
<P>If I mu&s;t &s;peak my Mind, reply'd I, I &s;hould take the Liberty to be very &s;erious with Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> and to &s;ay, That when a thing is done, and cannot be help'd, he &s;hould take care how he &s;ows the Seeds of Indif|ference and Animo&s;ity between Man and Wife: And how he makes a Gentleman di&s;&s;atisfy'd with his Choice, and perhaps unhappy as long as he lives.</P>
<P>Nay, Mi&s;s, &s;aid he, if all are again&s;t me, and you, who&s;e good Opinion I value more than all, you may e'en let the Girl come, and &s;it down, if you will.&mdash; If &s;he is but half as pretty, and half as wi&s;e, and mo|de&s;t, as you, I &s;hall&punc; as it cannot be help'd, as you &s;ay, be ready to think better of the Matter.

<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> looking at me, and nodding his Head to|wards Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> as he was in a Flutter to be gone, I aro&s;e from my Chair, and went to him, and took his Hand.

<P>Indeed it is not, Sir; you have done nothing but what I can forgive you for, if your dear Nephew can; for to him was the Wrong, if any, and I'm &s;ure he can overlook it.&mdash;And for his &s;ake, to the Uncle of &s;o honoured a Gentleman, to the Brother of my late good Lady, I can, with a bent Knee, <HI>thus,</HI> ask your Ble&s;&s;ing, and de&s;ire your Excu&s;e for joining to keep you in this Su&s;pen&s;e.</P>

I don't wonder at my Nephew's loving you!&mdash; And you call her Si&s;ter, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> don't you?&mdash; If you do, I'll own her for my Niece.</P>
<P>Don't I!&mdash;Yes, I do, &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, coming to me, and am proud &s;o to call her. And this I tell you, for <HI>your</HI> Comfort, tho' to <HI>my own</HI> Shame, that I u&s;ed her wor&s;e than you have done, before I knew her Excellence, and have repented of it ever &s;ince.</P>

<P>Well, but, Nephew, I hope <HI>you</HI> forgive me, too; for, now I think of it, I never knew you take any Matter &s;o patiently in my Life.</P>
<P>I knew, &s;aid the dear Gentleman, that every Ex|travagance you in&s;i&s;ted upon, was heightening my Charmer's Triumph, and increa&s;ing your own Con|trition; and as I was not <HI>indeed</HI> depriv'd of her Company, I could bear with every thing you &s;aid or did &mdash; Yet, don't you remember, that I caution'd you, that the le&s;s you &s;aid again&s;t her, the le&s;s you'd have to un&s;ay, and the le&s;s to repent of?</P>
<P>I do; and let me ride out, and call my&s;elf to Ac|count for all I &s;aid again&s;t her, in her own Hearing; and when I can think of but one half, and how &s;he has taken it, by my Soul, I believe 'twill make me more than half mad.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="328">At Dinner (when we had Mr. <HI>Williams</HI>'s Com|pany) the Baronet told me, he admir'd me now, as much as he did when he thought me Lady <HI>Jenny</HI>; but complain'd of the Trick put upon him by us all, and &s;eem'd now-and-then a little &s;erious upon it.</P>
<P>He took great Notice of the Dexterity which he imputed to me, in performing the Honours of the Table. And every now-and-then, he lifted up his Eyes, God take me! Very clever, by my Soul!&mdash; Why, Madam, you &s;eem to me to be born to the&s;e Things!&mdash;I will be help'd by nobody but you&mdash;And you'll have a Task of it, I can tell you; for I have a whipping Stomach, and were there fifty Di&s;hes, I always ta&s;te of every one.

<P>He went from us afterwards to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and made her an&s;wer him abundance of Que&s;tions about me, and how all the&s;e Matters had come about, as he phra&s;ed it; and returning, when we drank Coffee, &s;aid, I have been <HI>confabbing,</HI> that was his Word, with Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> about you, Niece.

I'd give you a Saraband, as old as I am.</P>
<P>After Supper, we fell into a Conver&s;ation, of which I mu&s;t give you &s;ome Account, becau&s;e it was upon a Topick that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has been blam'd for in his marrying me, and which has &s;tuck by &s;ome of his Friends, even after they have, in Kindne&s;s to me, acquitted him in every other re&s;pect; and that is, The Example that he has &s;et to young Gentlemen of Family and Fortune to marry beneath them.</P>
<P>It was begun by Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> who &s;aid, I am in Love with my new Niece, that I am: But &s;till one thing &s;ticks with me in this Affair; and that is, What will become of Degree or Di&s;tinction, if this Practice of Gentlemen marrying their Mothers Waiting-maids, (Excu&s;e me, Madam) &s;hould come into Vogue? Already, young Ladies and young Gentlemen are too apt to be drawn away in this manner, and to di&s;grace their Family. We have too many In&s;tances of this. You'll forgive me, both of you.</P>
<P>That, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> is the only Thing! &mdash; I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> has hit upon the Point, that would make one wi&s;h this Example had not been &s;et by a Gentleman of &s;uch an antient Family; till
<PB N="325" REF="330">
one comes to be acquainted with this dear Creature; and then every body thinks it ought not to be other|wi&s;e than it is.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> what can you &s;ay to this? Cannot you defend me from this Charge? This is a Point that has been often objected to me: Try for one of your pretty Arguments in my Behalf.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, reply'd I, looking down, it becomes not me to &s;ay any thing to this.</P>
<P>But indeed it does, if you can: And I beg you'll help me to &s;ome Excu&s;e, if you have any at Hand.</P>
<P>Won't you, Sir, di&s;pen&s;e with me, on this Occa&s;ion? Indeed, I know not what to &s;ay. Indeed I &s;hould not, if I may judge for my&s;elf, &s;peak one <HI>Word</HI> to this Subject.&mdash;For it is my ab&s;olute Opinion, that Degrees in general &s;hould be kept up; altho' I mu&s;t always deem the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e an happy Exception to the Rule.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> looking as if he &s;till expected I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething, Won't you, Sir, di&s;pen&s;e with me, re|peated I? Indeed I &s;hould not &s;peak to this Point, if I may be my own Judge.</P>
<P>I always intend, my Dear, you &s;hall judge for your&s;elf; and you know, I &s;eldom urge you farther, when you u&s;e tho&s;e Words. But if you have any thing upon your Mind to &s;ay, let's have it: For your Arguments are always new and unborrow'd.</P>
<P>I would then, if I <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> Sir, ask, If there be not a Nation, or if there has not been a Law in &s;ome Nation, That whenever a young Gentleman, be <HI>his</HI> Degree what it would, has &s;educed a poor Creature, be <HI>her</HI> Degree what it would, obliges the Gentleman to marry that unhappy Per&s;on?</P>
<P>I think there is &s;uch a Law in &s;ome Country, I can't tell where, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>And do you think, Sir, whether it be &s;o, or not that it is equitable it &s;hould be &s;o?</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="331">Yes, by my Troth&mdash; Tho', I mu&s;t needs own, if it were &s;o in <HI>England,</HI> many Men, that I know, would not have had the Wives they now have.</P>

<P>Why, indeed&mdash;Why, truly&mdash;I don't know but I do.</P>
<P>All then, &s;aid I, that I would infer is, Whether another Law would not be a &s;till more ju&s;t and equi|table one, that the Gentleman who is repuls'd, from a Principle of Virtue and Honour, &s;hould not be cen|&s;ur'd for marrying a Per&s;on he could <HI>not</HI> &s;educe? And whether it is not more for both their Honours, if he does; ina&s;much as it is nobler to reward a Vir|tue, than to repair a Shame, were that Shame to be repair'd by Matrimony; which I take the Liberty to doubt. But I beg Pardon; you commanded me, Sir&mdash;El&s;e this Subject &s;hould not have found a Speaker to it, in me.</P>
<P>This is admirably &s;aid&mdash;By my Soul, it is, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>But yet this comes not up to the Objection, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> The &s;etting an Example to Waiting-maids to a&s;pire, and to young Gentlemen to de&s;cend. And I will enter into the Subject my&s;elf; and the rather, becau&s;e, as I go along, I will give Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> a faint Sketch of the Merit and Character of my <HI>Pamela,</HI> of which he cannot be &s;o well inform'd, as he has been of the Di&s;grace, which he imagin'd I had brought upon my&s;elf by marrying her.</P>
<P>In order to this, give me Leave to &s;ay, That I think it nece&s;&s;ary, that as well tho&s;e Per&s;ons who are afraid the Example &s;hould be taken, as tho&s;e who are inclin'd to follow it, &s;hould take <HI>all</HI> the material Parts of it into their Con&s;ideration: Otherwi&s;e, I think the Precedent may be ju&s;tly cleared; and the Fears of the one be judged groundle&s;s, and the Plea

For &s;uch a young Fellow as that, would hardly do Honour to his Family in any <HI>one</HI> In|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, it would be pity, after all, that &s;uch an one &s;hould marry any Lady of Pru|dence and Birth; for, 'tis enough in Con&s;cience, that he is a Di&s;grace to <HI>one</HI> worthy Family; it would be pity he &s;hould make <HI>two</HI> unhappy.</P>
<P>Why, really, Nephew, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> I think you have &s;aid a great deal to the Purpo&s;e. There is not &s;o much Danger from the Example, as I appre|hended, from <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>reflecting</HI> Minds. I did not con&s;ider this Matter thoroughly, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay.</P>
<P>All the Bu&s;ine&s;s is, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers</HI>&mdash;You'll excu&s;e me, Si&s;ter&mdash;There will be more People will hear, that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> has marry'd his Mother's Waiting-maid, than will know his Inducements.</P>
<P>Not many, I believe, Si&s;ter&punc; &mdash; For when 'tis known, I have &s;ome Character in the World, and am not quite an Idiot, (And my Faults, in having not been one of the mo&s;t virtuous of Men, will &s;tand me in &s;ome Stead in <HI>this</HI> Ca&s;e, tho' hardly in <HI>any
<PB N="331" REF="336">
other</HI>) they will naturally inquire into my Induce|ments.</P>
<P>But &s;ee you not, when we go Abroad, to Church, or el&s;ewhere, what Numbers of People her Chara|cter draws to admire the dear Creature? Does not this &s;hew, that her Virtue has made her more con&s;pi|cuous, than my Fortune had made me? For I pa&s;s'd up and down quietly enough before, (hand&s;ome as my Equipage always was) and attracted not any body's Notice: And indeed I had as lieve the&s;e Honours were not &s;o publickly paid <HI>her;</HI> for even, were I <HI>fond</HI> of Shew and Parade, what are they, but a Reproach to me?&mdash;And can I have any Excellence, but a &s;econdary one, in having, after all my Per&s;ecutions of her, done but common Ju&s;tice to her Merit?</P>
<P>This an&s;wers your Objection, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and &s;hews, that <HI>my</HI> Inducements and <HI>her</HI> Story mu&s;t be equally known. And, upon my Con&s;cience, I think, (every thing I have &s;aid con&s;idered, and every thing that might &s;till farther be urged, and the Con|duct of that dear Creature in the Station &s;he adorns, &s;o much exceeding all I hoped, or could flatter my&s;elf with, from the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Appearances) that &s;he does me more Honour than I have done her; and if I am capable of putting my&s;elf in a third Per|&s;on's Place, I think I &s;hould be of the &s;ame Opinion, were I to determine upon &s;uch another Pair, exactly circum&s;tanc'd as we are.</P>
<P>You may believe, Mi&s;s, how much this generous Defence of the Step he had taken, attributing every thing to me, and depreciating his worthy Self, af|fected me. I play'd with a Cork now, with my Rings another time, turning them round my Fingers, looked down, and on one Side, and every Way I looked but on the Company; for they gazed too much upon me all the time; &s;o that I could only glance a tearful Eye now-and-then upon the dear Gentleman;
<PB N="332" REF="337">
and when it would overflow, catch in my Hand|kerchief the e&s;caped Fugitives, that would &s;tart un|bidden beyond their proper Limits, tho' I often en|deavoured, by a twinkling Motion, to di&s;per&s;e the ga|thering Water, before it had formed it&s;elf into Drops too big to be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>All the Company prai&s;ed the dear generous Speaker, and he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay farther, Altho', my good Friends, I can truly &s;ay, that with all the Pride of Family, and the In&s;olence of Fortune, which once made me doubt whether I &s;hould not &s;ink too low, if I made my <HI>Pamela</HI> my Mi&s;tre&s;s, (for I &s;hould then have treated her not ungenerou&s;ly, and &s;hould have &s;uffered her perhaps to call her&s;elf by my Name) I have never once repented of what I have done: On the contrary, I have always re|joiced in it, and it has been, from the fir&s;t Day of our Marriage, my Pride and my Boa&s;t, (and &s;hall be, let others &s;ay what they will) that I can call &s;uch an Excellence, and &s;uch a Purity, which I &s;o little de&s;erve, mine; and I look down with Contempt upon the Ra&s;hne&s;s of all &s;uch as reflect upon me; for they can have no Notion of my Happine&s;s, or her Merit.</P>
<P>O dear Sir! &s;aid I, how do you over-rate my poor Merit!&mdash;Some Per&s;ons are happy in a Life of <HI>Com|forts,</HI> but mine's a Life of <HI>Joy!</HI>&mdash;One rapturous In&s;tance follows another &s;o fa&s;t, that I know not how to bear them.</P>
<P>Whew!&mdash;whi&s;tled Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI>&mdash;Whereabouts am I?&mdash;I hope, by-and-by, you'll come down to our Pitch, that one may put in a Word or two with you.</P>
<P>May you be long thus ble&s;t, and thus happy to|gether! &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers.</HI> I know not which to ad|mire mo&s;t, the dear Girl, that never was bad, or the dear Gentleman, that, having been bad, is now &s;o good!</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> having his Elbows on the Table, folded his Hands, &s;haking them, and looking down upon the Table, Egad, this is uncommon Life, that it is! &mdash;Your two Souls, I can &s;ee that, are like well-tun'd In&s;truments: But they are too high-&s;et for me a va&s;t deal.</P>
<P>The be&s;t thing, &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> always &s;evere upon her poor Nephew, thou ever &s;aid&s;t. The Mu&s;ick mu&s;t be equal to that of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> which can make &s;uch a Savage as thee dance to it. I charge thee, &s;ay not another Word To-night.</P>
<P>Why, indeed, Aunt, return'd he, laughing, I be|lieve it <HI>was</HI> pretty well &s;aid for your fooli&s;h Fellow: Tho' it was by Chance, I mu&s;t confe&s;s: I did not think of it.</P>
<P>That I believe, reply'd my Lady;&mdash;if thou had&s;t, thou'd&s;t not have &s;poken &s;o well.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> afterwards fell into a Family Di&s;cour&s;e; and Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> gave us an Account of two or three Court&s;hips <HI>by</HI> his three Sons, and <HI>to</HI> his two Daughters, and his Rea&s;ons for di&s;allowing them: And I could ob&s;erve, he is an ab&s;olute Tyrant in his Family, tho' they are all Men and Women grown, and he &s;eem'd to plea&s;e him&s;elf how much they &s;tood in Awe of him.</P>
<P>One odd Piece of Conver&s;ation I mu&s;t tell you, Mi&s;s, becau&s;e of the Inference that followed it.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="339">Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> asked Mr. <HI>B.</HI> If he did not remember <HI>John Wilkins,</HI> his Steward? He was an hone&s;t Fellow, &s;aid he, as ever liv'd.&mdash;But he's dead. Alas for him, poor <HI>Jack!</HI>&mdash;He phy&s;icked him&s;elf out of his Life.&mdash;He would be always taking Slops: Had I done &s;o, I &s;hould have gone to the Dogs long ago.&mdash;But whom do you think, Nephew, I've got in his Place? &mdash; Nay, you can't know him neither. Why, 'tis <HI>Jerry Sherwood,</HI> a Boy I took upon Cha|rity, and taught to write and read, or paid for't, and that's the &s;ame thing&mdash;Hay, you know!&mdash;And now <HI>Jerry</HI>'s a Gentleman's Fellow, and is much re|&s;pected by all our Hunters; for he's a keen Sport&s;man, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. I brought him up to that my&s;elf, and many a Jirk has the Dog had from me, before I could make any thing of him. Many and many a good time have I whacked the Ra&s;cal's Jacket; and he owes all he is, and will be, to me: And I now &s;uffer him to &s;it down at Table with me, when I have no Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>But is not this a bad Example, &s;aid Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to pro|mote &s;o low a Servant to the Command of the Fa|mily, under you? What do <HI>Gentlemen</HI> &s;ay to this?</P>
<P>Gentlemen &s;ay to it!&mdash;Why, what Gentlemen have any thing to do with my Family Management?&mdash; Surely, I may do as I will in my own Hou&s;e, and in my own Family; or el&s;e it would be very hard.</P>
<P>True, Sir <HI>Jacob</HI>; but People will be meddling, where they have lea&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s. But are not all the Gentlemen unea&s;y, for fear their <HI>lowe&s;t Servants,</HI> from the Example &s;et by &s;o leading a Man as you, a Chairman of the Se&s;&s;ions, a Colonel of Militia, a Deputy Lieutenant, and a Ju&s;tice of Quorum, &s;hould want to be made their <HI>Stewards?</HI></P>
<P>Why, I can't &s;ay that any body has taken it into their Heads to que&s;tion me upon this Subject. I &s;hould
<PB N="335" REF="340">
think 'em plaguy impertinent, if they had, and bid them mind their own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But you'll allow, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> that every one who knows you have rais'd your Foot-boy to be your Steward, will not know your <HI>Inducements</HI>; altho', I doubt not, they are very good ones.</P>
<P>Lady <HI>Davers</HI> &s;hook her Head at her Brother, &s;ay|ing, Very well, Sir; very well!</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> cry'd out, O ho, Nephew! are you thereabouts with your Bears? Why, I can't &s;ay, but you're <HI>in</HI> with me now.&mdash;Let's &s;ee, what have I &s;aid? &mdash; Ay, by my Soul, you have nabbed me cleverly. Faith and Troth, you have convinc'd me by an Example of my own, that I was impertinent to trouble my Head about the Management of your Family.&mdash;Tho' near Kindred makes &s;ome Excu&s;e for me too.&mdash;And, be&s;ides, a <HI>Steward</HI> and a <HI>Wife</HI> are two Things.</P>
<P>So I'd have 'em be, Sir <HI>Jacob:</HI> But a good Wife is but a Steward to her Husband, in many Ca&s;es; and mine is the be&s;t that ever Gentleman had.</P>
<P>Pretty expen&s;ive ones, Nephew, for all that, as the World runs.&mdash;Mo&s;t Gentlemen find, I believe, the&s;e Sort of Stewards run 'em out more than they &s;ave: But that's not your Ca&s;e, I dare &s;ay.&mdash;I'faith, tho', you have nicked me cleverly, that you have.</P>
<P>But, my witty Brother, &s;aid my Lady, I believe you'd better, for all your Fling at me, as to <HI>Induce|ments,</HI> &s;tick to your fir&s;t Defence, as to the Example &s;ake; for, who &s;tands upon Birth or Degree in the Office of a Steward?</P>
<P>It will an&s;wer &s;everal Purpo&s;es, Si&s;ter, and come nearer the Point in what you object, than you are aware of, were we to di&s;pute upon it. But I have gain'd my End in the Ob&s;ervation: Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> takes the Force of the Compari&s;on, and is convinced, I dare &s;ay, there is &s;ome Ju&s;tice in it.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="341">Ay, ay, a great deal, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob</HI>; for a Wife is, or ought to be, her Husband's Steward. I'm &s;ure, when mine was living, I made her &s;o, and had no other; for &s;he made Memorandums, and I dige&s;ted them into Book; and yet &s;he brought me a noble Fortune too, as you all know.</P>
<P>Here I conclude my tedious Narrations.&mdash;Be &s;o good as to skim them over lightly, that you may not think the wor&s;e of me; and then return them to me, (with &s;ome of your charming Penman&s;hip) that I may &s;end them on to <HI>Kent.</HI> To be &s;ure I would not have been &s;o tediou&s;ly trifling, but for the Sake of my dear Parents; And there is &s;o much Self-prai&s;e, as it may &s;eem, from a Per&s;on repeating the fine Things &s;aid of her&s;elf, that I am half of Opinion I &s;hould &s;end them to <HI>Kent</HI> only, and to think you &s;hould be obliged to me for &s;aving you &s;o much Trouble and Impertinence.</P>
<P>Do, dear Mi&s;s, be &s;o free as to forbid me to &s;end you any more long Journals, but common Let|ters only, of How do you? and Who and who's together, and of Re&s;pects to one, and to another, and &s;o forth&mdash;Letters that one might di&s;patch, as Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;ays, in a <HI>Twinkling,</HI> and perhaps be more to the Purpo&s;e, than the tedious Scrawl, which ki&s;&s;es your Hands, from,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I MUST recapitulate the Plea&s;ure you have given us in your charming Accounts of your Conver|&s;ations with your <HI>London</HI> Gue&s;ts, and the Ver&s;es put &s;o boldly, and wickedly under your Seat; and your ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations on the Lines, and the Occa&s;ion. But we all humbly reque&s;t you'll be plea&s;ed to give us the Copy of the Manu&s;cript Ver&s;es, from which you tran&s;cribe the pretty Lines, beginning&mdash;
<Q>But, Oh! forgive me, Heav'n, if oft my Fair.</Q></P>
<P>I am quite &s;hock'd, when I think of Lady <HI>Davers</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ionate Intentions, at her fir&s;t coming down to you to the Hall, but have let nobody into the wor&s;t of the Matter, in Compliance with your De&s;ire. We are delighted with your Account of Family Manage|ment, and your <HI>Sunday</HI>'s Service.&mdash;What an excel|lent Lady are you! And how happy, and how good you make every one who knows you, is &s;een by the Ladies joining in your Evening Service, as well as their Servants.</P>
<P>We go on here &s;wimmingly with our Court&s;hip. Never was there a fonder Couple than Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> and Mi&s;s <HI>Nancy.</HI> The moody Girl is quite alive, ea&s;y and pleas'd, except now-and-then with me.&mdash; We had a &s;ad Falling-out t'other Day. Thus it was:</P>
<P>She had the A&s;&s;urance, on my &s;aying, they were &s;o fond and &s;o free before-hand, that they would leave nothing for Improvement afterwards; to tell me, She had for &s;ome time perceived, that my Envy was very di&s;quieting to me. This she &s;aid before Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> who had the good Manners to retire, &s;eeing a Storm ri&s;ing between us.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="343">Poor, fooli&s;h Girl! cry'd I, when he was gone, provok'd to great Contempt by her Expre&s;&s;ion be|fore him, Thou wilt make me de&s;pi&s;e thee, in &s;pite of my Heart.&mdash;But pr'ythee, manage thy Matters with common Decency, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Good lack! <HI>Common Decency!</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>Common Decency!</HI> When my Si&s;ter <HI>Polly</HI> is able to &s;hew me what it is, I &s;hall hope to be better for her Example.</P>
<P>No, thou'lt never be better for any body's Ex|ample! Thy Ill-nature and Perver&s;ene&s;s will keep thee from that, as it has always hitherto done.</P>
<P>My Ill-temper you have often told me is <HI>natural</HI> to me; &s;o it mu&s;t become me: But upon &s;uch a &s;weet-temper'd young Lady as Mi&s;s <HI>Polly,</HI> it &s;its but ill!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t have had no bad Temper, and that every one &s;ays, to bear with thy &s;ullen and perver&s;e one, as I have done, all my Life.</P>
<P>But why can't you bear with it a little longer, Si&s;ter?&mdash;Does any thing provoke you <HI>now,</HI> with a &s;ly Leer, and affected Drawl, that did not <HI>formerly?</HI></P>
<P>Provoke me!&mdash;What &s;hould provoke me?&mdash;I gave thee but a Hint of thy fond Folly, which makes thee behave &s;o before Company, that every one &s;miles at thee; and I'd be glad to &s;ave thee from Contempt for thy <HI>new</HI> good Humour, as I u&s;ed to try to do, for thy <HI>old</HI> bad Nature.</P>
<P>Is that it?&mdash;What a kind Sister have I!&mdash;But perhaps I &s;ee it vexes you; and <HI>ill-natured</HI> Folks love to teize, you know.&mdash;But, dear <HI>Polly,</HI> don't let the Affection Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> expre&s;&s;es for me, put &s;uch a good-temper'd Body out of Humour, pray don't.&mdash; Who knows, (continued the Provoker, who never &s;ays a tolerable thing that is not ill-natur'd, that being her Talent) but the Gentleman may think him&s;elf happy, that he has found a way with &s;o much Ea&s;e to di&s;pen&s;e with the Difficulty that Elder&s;hip laid
<PB N="339" REF="344">
him under?&mdash;But as he did you the Favour to let the Repul&s;e come from you, don't be angry, Si&s;ter, that he took you at the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Word.</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, &s;aid I with a contemptuous Smile, thou'rt right, <HI>Nancy,</HI> to take the Gentleman at <HI>his</HI> fir&s;t Word. Hold him fa&s;t, and play over all thy Monkey Airs with him, with all my Heart: Who knows but it may engage him more? For &s;hould he leave thee, I might be too much provok'd at thy Ingratitude to <HI>turn over</HI> another Gentleman to thee &mdash;And, let me tell you, without &s;uch an Introduc|tion, thy Temper would keep any body from thee, that knows it.</P>
<P>Poor Mi&s;s <HI>Polly!</HI>&mdash;Come, be as ea&s;y as you can! &mdash;Who knows but we may find out &s;ome Cou&s;in or Friend of Mr. <HI>Murray</HI>'s between us, that we may <HI>per&s;uade</HI> to addre&s;s you? Don't make us your Enemies: We'll try to make you ea&s;y, if we can&mdash; 'Tis a little hard, that you &s;hould be &s;o cruelly taken at your Word, that it is.</P>
<P>Do&s;t think, &s;aid I, poor, &s;tupid, ill-judging <HI>Nancy,</HI> that I can have the &s;ame Regret for parting with a Man I could not like, that thou had&s;t, when thy vain Hopes met with the Repul&s;e they de&s;erved from Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> come up again! I have not heard of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> a great while!</P>
<P>No, but it was nece&s;&s;ary, reply'd I, that one Nail &s;hould drive out another; for thou'd&s;t been repining &s;till, had not Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> been <HI>turn'd over</HI> to thee.</P>
<P><HI>Turn'd over!</HI> you us'd that Word once before, Si&s;ter: Such great Wits as you, methinks, &s;hould not u&s;e the &s;ame Word &s;o often.</P>
<P>How do&s;t <HI>thou</HI> know what Wits <HI>&s;hould,</HI> or &s;hould <HI>not</HI> do? Thou ha&s;t no Talent but Ill-nature, and 'tis enough for thee, that one View takes up thy whole Thought. Pur&s;ue that&mdash;But I would only cau|tion
<PB N="340" REF="345">
thee, that thou do&s;t not <HI>&s;atiate</HI> where thou would&s;t <HI>oblige,</HI> that's all: Or if thy Man can be &s;o gro&s;s, as to like thy Fondne&s;s, that thou leave&s;t &s;ome|thing for <HI>Hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>I'll call him in again, Si&s;ter, and you &s;hall acquaint us how you'd have it. <HI>Bell,</HI> for the Maid came in ju&s;t then, tell Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> I de&s;ire him to walk in.</P>
<P>I'm glad to &s;ee thee &s;o teachable all at once!&mdash; I find out now what was the Cau&s;e of thy con&s;tant Perver&s;ene&s;s: For had the unavailing Le&s;&s;ons, my Mamma was always inculcating upon thee, come from a <HI>Man</HI> thou could&s;t have had Hopes of, they had &s;ucceeded better.</P>
<P>In came Sir <HI>Simon,</HI> with his Crutch-Stick&mdash;But can you bear this Non&s;en&s;e, Mrs. <HI>B.?</HI>&mdash;What! &s;par|ring, jangling again, you Sluts!&mdash;O what fiery Eyes on one &s;ide! and contemptuous Looks on t'other!</P>
<P>Why, Papa, my Si&s;ter <HI>Polly</HI> has <HI>turn'd over</HI> Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> to me, and &s;he wants him back again, and he won't come&mdash;That's all the Matter!</P>
<P>You know your Daughter <HI>Nancy,</HI> Papa&mdash;She could never <HI>bear</HI> Reproof, and yet would always <HI>de&s;erve</HI> it!&mdash;I was only gently remarking for her In&s;truction, on her Fondne&s;s before Company, and &s;he is as &s;he <HI>u&s;ed to be!</HI>&mdash;The poor Girl has not indeed been u&s;ed to be courted, and &s;o knows not how to behave her&s;elf.</P>
<P>So, <HI>Polly,</HI> becau&s;e you have been able to run over a long Li&s;t of humble Servants, you mu&s;t in&s;ult your Si&s;ter, mu&s;t you?&mdash;But are you really con|cern'd, <HI>Polly?</HI>&mdash;Hay!</P>
<P>Sir, this or any thing, is very well from you.&mdash; But the&s;e Imputations of Envy, before Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> mu&s;t make the Man very con&s;iderable with him&s;elf. Poor <HI>Nancy</HI> don't con&s;ider that.&mdash;But indeed how &s;hould &s;he? How &s;hould <HI>&s;he</HI> be able to reflect, who knows not what Reflection is, except of the &s;pite|ful
<PB N="341" REF="346">
Sort? But, Papa, &s;hould the poor Thing add to <HI>his</HI> Vanity, which wants no Addition, at the Ex|pence of <HI>her own?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;aw her affected, and was re&s;olv'd to pur&s;ue my Advantage.</P>
<P>Pr'ythee, <HI>Nancy,</HI> continu'd I, can&s;t thou not have a <HI>little</HI> Patience, Child?&mdash; My Papa will &s;et the Day as &s;oon as he &s;hall think it proper. And don't let thy Man toil to keep Pace with thy Fond|ne&s;s; for I have pity'd him many a time, when I have &s;een him &s;tretched on the Tenters to keep thee in Countenance.</P>
<P>This &s;et the ill-natur'd Girl into Tears and Fret|fulne&s;s; all her old Temper came upon her, as I de&s;ign'd it &s;hould; for &s;he had kept me at Bay longer than u&s;ual; and I left her under the Domi|nion of it; and becau&s;e I would not come into a fre&s;h Di&s;pute, got my Mamma's Leave, and the Chariot, and went and begg'd a Dinner at Lady <HI>Jones</HI>'s; and then came home as cool and as ea&s;y, as I us'd to be, and found <HI>Nancy</HI> as &s;ullen and &s;ilent as was her Cu&s;tom, before Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> tendered him&s;elf to her ready Acceptance. But I went to my Spinnet, and &s;uffer'd her to &s;well on.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid nothing but No, and Yes ever &s;ince; And I wi&s;h I was with you for a Month, and all their Non&s;en&s;e over without me. I am, my dear, obliging, and excellent Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV. From Mi&s;s <HI>DARNFORD</HI> to Mrs. <HI>B.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY give my Service to your Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and tell him, he is very unpolite, in his Reflections <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this <HI>Vol.</HI> p. <HI>265.</HI></NOTE> upon me, in relation to Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> when he &s;up|po&s;es I regret the Lo&s;s of him. You are much more favourable and ju&s;t too, I will &s;ay, to your <HI>Polly Darnford.</HI> The&s;e Gentlemen, the very be&s;t of them, are &s;uch Indelicates! They think &s;o highly of their &s;aucy Selves, and confident Sex, as if a Lady cannot from <HI>her Heart</HI> de&s;pi&s;e them. But if &s;he turns them off, as they de&s;erve, and happens to continue her Di&s;like, what &s;hould be interpreted in her Favour, as a ju&s;t and <HI>regular</HI> Piece of Conduct, is turn'd again&s;t her, and it mu&s;t proceed from Spite.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> may think he knows a good deal of the Sex. But perhaps, were I as malicious as he is re|flecting, (and yet, if I have any Malice, he has rai&s;ed it) I could &s;ay, That his Acquaintance was not with the mo&s;t unexceptionable, till he had the Happine&s;s to know you: And he has not long enough been happy in you, I find, to do Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e who are proud to emulate your Virtues.</P>
<P>But I can't bear, <HI>it &s;eems,</HI> to &s;ee my Si&s;ter ad|dre&s;s'd and complimented, and preferr'd by one whom I had thought in my own Power! But he <HI>may</HI> be mi&s;taken: With all his Sagacity, he <HI>has been</HI> often. Nor is it &s;o mortifying a thing to me, as he imagines, to &s;it and &s;ee two &s;uch Anticks playing
<PB N="343" REF="348">
their Pugs Tricks, as he calls them, with one an|other.</P>
<P>But you hardly ever &s;aw <HI>&s;uch</HI> Pug's Tricks play'd as they play, at &s;o early a Time of Court&s;hip. The Girl hangs upon his Arm, and receives his empty Head on her Shoulder, already, with a Freedom that would be cen&s;urable in a Bride, before Folks. A &s;tiff, &s;ullen, proud, &s;cornful Girl, as &s;he u&s;ed to be, &s;he now puts on Airs that are not natural either to her Features or her Character; and judge then how it mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t one; e&s;pecially when one &s;ees her Man &s;o proud and vain upon it, that, like a true Man, he treats her with the le&s;s Ceremony for her Con|de&s;cen&s;ions, putting on Airs of Con&s;equence, while her Ea&s;ine&s;s of Behaviour makes him &s;ecure of Ac|ceptance, and a kind Reception, let him be as neg|ligent or as forward as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> there can be no living with the&s;e Men upon &s;uch Beginnings.&mdash;They ought to know their Di&s;tance, or be taught it; and not to think it in their Power to confer that as a Favour, which they &s;hould think it an Honour to receive.</P>
<P>But neither can I bear, <HI>it &s;eems,</HI> the Preparatives to Matrimony, the fine Cloaths, the Compliments, the bu&s;y Novelty, as he calls it, the new Equipages, and &s;o forth. That's his Mi&s;take again, tell him: For one, who can look forwarder than the Nine Days of Wonder, can ea&s;ily de&s;pi&s;e &s;o fla&s;hy and &s;o tran&s;ient a Glare. And were I fond of Compliments, it would not perhaps be the way to be plea&s;ed, if I were to marry.</P>
<P>Compliments in the &s;ingle State are a Lady's Due, whether courted or not; and &s;he receives them, or ought always to receive them, as &s;uch: But in Court|&s;hip they are pour'd out upon one, like a ha&s;ty Shower, that one knows will &s;oon be over!&mdash;A mighty comfortable Con&s;ideration this, to a Lady
<PB N="344" REF="349">
who <HI>loves to be complimented!</HI>&mdash;In&s;tead of the re|fre&s;hing <HI>April</HI>-like Showers, which beautify the Sun&s;hine, &s;he &s;hall &s;tand a Deluge of Complai&s;ance, be wet to the Skin with it; and then&mdash;What then!&mdash; Why be in a <HI>Libyan</HI> De&s;art ever after&mdash;; experience a con&s;tant parching Drought, and all her fine Attri|butes will be &s;wallow'd up in the Quick&s;ands of Ma|trimony.</P>
<P>It may be otherwi&s;e with you; and it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be otherwi&s;e; becau&s;e there is &s;uch an infinite Variety in your Excellence. Every ri&s;ing Sun adorns you with &s;ome new Rays, and &s;ets not, without leaving you brighter than he him&s;elf can hold it.&mdash;But does Mr. <HI>B.</HI> think it mu&s;t be &s;o in <HI>every</HI> Matrimony?</P>
<P>'Tis true, he improves every Hour, as I &s;ee in your kind Papers, in his fine Speeches to you. But it could not be Mr. <HI>B.</HI> if he did not: Your Merit <HI>extorts</HI> it from him: And what an ingrateful, as well as ab&s;urd Churl, would he be, who &s;hould &s;eek to ob&s;cure a meridian Lu&s;tre, that dazles the Eyes of every one el&s;e?</P>
<P>But, let me ob&s;erve, moreover, that you had &s;o few of the&s;e fine Speeches <HI>before-hand,</HI> that you have all the Rea&s;on in the World to expect them <HI>now:</HI> And this le&s;&s;ens his Merit a good deal, as the mo&s;t he can &s;ay, is but common Ju&s;tice, on <HI>full Preof</HI>&punc; for, can the like Genero&s;ity be attributed to him, as might to a Gentleman who prai&s;es <HI>on Tru&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>You promi&s;e, if I will come to you, you will join with me again&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> on this Subject. 'Tis very kindly offer'd: but when Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is in the Que|&s;tion, I expect very little A&s;&s;i&s;tance from you, be the Argument what it will.</P>
<P>But 'tis not <HI>my</HI> Fault, I don't come. I am quite tir'd with the perver&s;e Folly of this <HI>Nancy</HI> of ours. She every Day behaves <HI>more</HI> like a Fool to Mr. <HI>Murray,</HI> and <HI>le&s;s</HI> like a Si&s;ter to me, and takes De|light
<PB N="345" REF="350">
to teize and vex me, by all the little ways in her Power. And then Surline&s;s and Ill-temper are &s;o natural to her, that I, who can but throw out a &s;piteful Word, by way of Flouri&s;h, as I may &s;ay, and 'tis over, and I am &s;orry for it as &s;oon as &s;poken, am no Match for her&mdash;For &s;he <HI>per&s;everes</HI> &s;o intolerably, and comes back to the Attack, tho' never &s;o often repuls'd, ri&s;ing like <HI>Antaeus,</HI> with fre&s;h Vigour for every Fall, or like the <HI>Lernaean Hydra,</HI> which had a new Head &s;prouting up, as fa&s;t as any one of the Seven was lopt off, that there is no bearing her. Wedlock, in fine, mu&s;t be her <HI>Hercules,</HI> and will furni&s;h me, I doubt, with a Revenge I wi&s;h not for.</P>
<P>But let me thank you for your delightful Narra|tives, and beg you to continue them. I told you how your <HI>Saturday's</HI> Conver&s;ation with Lady <HI>Da|vers,</HI> and your <HI>Sunday</HI> Imployments, charm us all: So regular, and &s;o ea&s;y to be perform'd!&mdash;That's the delightful thing.&mdash; What every body may do! &mdash; And yet &s;o beautiful, &s;o laudable, &s;o uncommon in the Practice, e&s;pecially among People in genteel Life!</P>
<P>Your Conver&s;ation and Deci&s;ion in relation to the two Par&s;ons (more than charm) tran&s;port us. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> let me tell you, judges right, and acts a charm|ing Part, to throw &s;uch a fine Game into your Hands. And &s;o excellently do you play it, that never &s;urely was &s;o happy a Couple!</P>
<P>He has a prodigious Merit <HI>with</HI> me, I can tell him, tho' he thinks not &s;o well <HI>of</HI> me as I would have him. To <HI>&s;ee,</HI> to <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> and to <HI>reward</HI> a Virtue, is <HI>next</HI> to having it <HI>one's &s;elf:</HI> And, in time, he will make as good a <HI>Man</HI> (the&s;e fine Appearances encourage one to hope &s;o) as he is a <HI>Husband.</HI></P>
<P>Your Notions of Di&s;pen&s;ations, and double Livings, are admirably ju&s;t. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> is more
<PB N="346" REF="351">
my Favourite than ever!&mdash;And the amply-rewarded Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> how did that Scene affect us!</P>
<P>Again, and again, I &s;ay, (for what can I &s;ay el&s;e, or more &mdash; &s;ince I can't find Words to &s;peak all I think?) you're a charming Lady! &mdash;Yet, methinks, poor Mr. <HI>H.</HI> makes but a &s;orry Figure among you.</P>
<P>We are delighted with Lady <HI>Davers</HI>; but &s;till more, if po&s;&s;ible, with the Counte&s;s: She is a fine Lady, as you have drawn her; but your Characters, tho' Truth and Nature, are the mo&s;t &s;hocking, or the mo&s;t amiable, that ever I read.</P>
<P>We are full of Impatience to hear of the Arrival of Sir <HI>Jacob Swynford.</HI> We know his Character pretty well: But when he has &s;at for it to your Pencil, it mu&s;t be an Original indeed.</P>
<P>I will have another Trial with my Papa, to move him to let me attend you. I am rallying my Forces for that Purpo&s;e: I have got my Mamma on my Side again; who is concern'd to &s;ee her Girl vexed and in&s;ulted by her younger Si&s;ter; and who yet minds no more what <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;ays to her, than what <HI>I</HI> &s;ay; and Sir <HI>Simon</HI> loves at his Heart to make Mi&s;|chief between us, in&s;tead of interpo&s;ing to &s;ilence either: And truly, I am afraid, the Delight of this kind, which he takes, will make him deny his <HI>Polly</HI> what &s;he &s;o ardently wi&s;hes for.</P>
<P>I had a good Mind to be &s;ick, to be with you. I could fa&s;t two or three Days, to give it the better Appearance; but then my Mamma, who loves not Deceit, would blame me, if &s;he knew my Stra|tagem; and be grieved, if &s;he thought I was really ill. &mdash; I know, Fa&s;ting, when one has a Stomach to eat, gives one a very gloomy and mortify'd Air.</P>
<P>What would not one do, in &s;hort, to procure to one's &s;elf the inexpre&s;&s;ible Plea&s;ure that I &s;hould have in your Company and Conver&s;ation? But
<PB N="347" REF="352">

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. From the &s;ame.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My deare&s;t Mrs.</HI> B.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am all over Joy and Rapture. My good Papa has given me Leave to tell you, that he will put his <HI>Polly</HI> under your Protection, when you go to <HI>London.</HI> If you have but a Tenth Part of the Plea|&s;ure I have on this Occa&s;ion, I am &s;ure I &s;hall be as welcome as I wi&s;h. But he will in&s;i&s;t upon it, he &s;ays, that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> &s;igns &s;ome Acknowlegement, which I am to carry along with <HI>me,</HI> that I am in|tru&s;ted to his Honour and yours, and to be returned to him <HI>Heart-whole,</HI> and <HI>Dutiful,</HI> and with a Repu|tation as un&s;ully'd as he receives me.</P>
<P>But do, deare&s;t Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> continue your Journals till then; for I have promis'd to take them up where you leave off, to divert our Friends in the&s;e Parts. There will be Pre&s;umption! But yet I will write nothing but what I will &s;hew you, and have your Con&s;ent to &s;end: For I was taught early not to tell Tales out of School; and a School, the be&s;t I ever went to, will be your charming Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>We have been greatly diverted with the Trick put upon that Barbarian Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI> His Ob&s;tinacy, Repentance, and Amendment, follow'd &s;o irre&s;i&s;t|ibly in one Half-hour, from the happy Thought of the excellent Lady Counte&s;s, that I think no Plot was ever more fortunate. It was like &s;pringing a lucky Mine in a Siege, that blew up twenty times more than was expected from it, and an&s;wer'd all the Be&s;ieger's Ends at once.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="353">Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Defence of his own Conduct to|wards you, is quite noble; and he judges with his u&s;ual Genero&s;ity and good Sen&s;e, when, by adding to your Honour, he knows he inhances his own. Mr. <HI>Pitt</HI>'s fine Diamond met with a world of Admirers; but all turn'd upon this Reflection, What a happy Man is Mr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> who can call &s;uch a Jewel his own!&mdash;How greatly do you excel this Diamond; and how much does Mr. <HI>B.</HI> outdo Mr. <HI>Pitt!</HI>&mdash; Who has contributed to give &s;o rich a Jewel a Poli&s;h &s;o admirable; and then has &s;et it in &s;o noble a Light, as makes its Beauty con&s;picuous to every Eye!</P>
<P>You bid me skim over your Writings lightly; bur 'tis impo&s;&s;ible. I will not flatter you, my dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> nor will I be &s;u&s;pected to do &s;o; and yet I cannot find Words to prai&s;e, &s;o much as I think you de&s;erve: So I will only &s;ay, that your good Parents, for who&s;e Plea&s;ure you write as well as for mine, cannot receive or read them with more Delight than I do&mdash;Even my Si&s;ter <HI>Nancy,</HI> judge of their Effect by this! will at any time leave <HI>Mur|ray,</HI> and forget to frown or be ill-natur'd, while &s;he can hear read what you write&mdash;And, angry as &s;he makes me &s;ometimes, I cannot deny her this Plea&s;ure, becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly, among the innumer|able improving Reflections they abound with, &s;ome one may po&s;&s;ibly dart in upon her, and illuminate her, as your Conver&s;ation and Behaviour did Sir <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>But your Application in P. S. to my Papa plea&s;ed him, and confirmed his Re&s;olution to let me go&mdash;He &s;natched the Sheet that contained this; That's to me! &s;aid he: &mdash;I mu&s;t read this my&s;elf; He did&mdash;and &s;aid&mdash;I'faith, &s;he's a &s;weet one! &mdash; <HI>Do&punc; dear good Sir</HI> Simon, repeated he aloud, <HI>let Mi&s;s</HI> Polly <HI>add to our Delights!</HI>&mdash;So &s;he &s;hall then;
<PB N="349" REF="354">
&mdash;If that will do it!&mdash;And yet this &s;ame Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> has &s;o many Delights already, that I &s;hould think &s;he might be contented.&mdash;But, Dame <HI>Darnford,</HI> I think I'll let her go. The&s;e Si&s;ters then, you'll &s;ee, how they'll love at a Di&s;tance, tho' always quar|relling when together. He read on&mdash;<HI>The new Affair will divert you &mdash;Lady</HI> Darnford <HI>has con&s;ented&mdash; Mi&s;s is willing; and her Si&s;ter can &s;pare her</HI>&mdash;Very prettily put, faith&mdash;<HI>And don't you be &s;o cro&s;s</HI>&mdash;Very &s;weet!&mdash;<HI>to deny me!</HI></P>
<P>Why, dear Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> I won't be &s;o cro&s;s, then; indeed I won't!&mdash;And &s;o, <HI>Polly,</HI> let 'em &s;end Word when <HI>they</HI> &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>you</HI> &s;hall join 'em there, with all my Heart: But I'll have a Let|ter every Po&s;t, remember that, Girl.</P>
<P>Any thing, any thing, dear Papa, &s;aid I; &s;o I can but go! He called for a Ki&s;s, for his Com|pliance. I gave it mo&s;t willingly, you may believe.</P>
<P><HI>Nancy</HI> looked envious, altho' Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> came in ju&s;t then&mdash;She look'd almo&s;t like a great Glut|ton, whom I remember, one Sir <HI>Jonathan Smith,</HI> who killed him&s;elf by eating: He us'd, while he was heaping up his Plate from one Di&s;h, to watch the others, and follow the Knife of every Body el&s;e, with &s;uch a greedy Eye, as if he could &s;wear a Robbery again&s;t any one who pre&s;umed to eat as well as he. This is a gro&s;s Simile; but all greedy and envious Folks look alike about the Eyes; and, thinking of <HI>Nancy</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, (who envied a Happine&s;s &s;he knew I preferred to that &s;he has in Pro&s;pect). I could not but call to mind Sir <HI>Jonathan</HI> at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Well, let's know when you &s;et out, and you &s;han't have been a Week in <HI>London,</HI> if I can help it, but you &s;hall be told by my Tongue, as now by my Pen, how much I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SIGNED>My dear Mi&s;s,</SIGNED></OPENER>
<P>I NOW proceed with my Journal, which I had brought down to <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Night.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FRIDAY.</HEAD>
<P>The two Ladies re&s;olving, as they &s;aid, to in&s;pect all my Proceedings, in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that I would take them with me in my <HI>benevolent Round,</HI> as they, after we return'd, would call it, which I ge|nerally take once a Week, among my poor and &s;ick Neighbours; and finding I could not get off, I &s;et out with them, my Lady Counte&s;s propo&s;ing Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> to fill up the fourth Place in the Coach.</P>
<P>We talked all the Way of Charity, and the Ex|cellency of that Duty; and my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> took Notice of the Text, that it would hide a <HI>Multi|tude of Faults.</HI> And if, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, there was to be any Truth in the Popi&s;h Doctrine of Supererogation, what abundance of <HI>&s;uch</HI> Merits would ari&s;e from the Life and Actions of our dear Friend here! kindly looking at me.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, That when we had the Plea&s;ure to reflect, that we &s;erved a Ma&s;ter, who exacted no hard Terms from us, but in every Ca&s;e almo&s;t that could be thought of, only required of us to do Ju&s;tice, and &s;hew Mercy, to one another, and gave us Rea|&s;on to think he would judge us by tho&s;e Rules, it mu&s;t be a mighty Inducement to Acts of Charity
<PB N="351" REF="356">
and Benevolence. But indeed, added I, were there not that Inducement, the Plea&s;ure that attends &s;uch Acts, is an high Reward; and I am &s;ure the Ladies I have the Honour to &s;peak to, mu&s;t have found it in an hundred In&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s &s;aid, She had once a much better Opinion of her&s;elf, than &s;he found &s;he had Rea&s;on for, within the&s;e <HI>few Days</HI> pa&s;t: And indeed Mrs. <HI>B</HI> &s;aid &s;he, when I get home, I &s;hall make a good many People the better for your Example. And &s;o &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers</HI>; which gave me no &s;mall inward Plea&s;ure; and I acknowleg'd, in &s;uitable Terms, the Honour they both did me.</P>
<P>The Coach &s;et us down by the Side of a large Common, about five Miles di&s;tant from our Hou&s;e; and we alighted, and walked a little Way, chu&s;ing not to have the Coach come nearer, that we might be taken as little Notice of as po&s;&s;ible; and they en|tered with me into two mean Cots with great Con|de&s;cen&s;ion and Goodne&s;s; one belonging to a poor Widow, and five Children, who had been all down in Agues and Fevers; the other, to a Man and his Wife, Bed-rid with Age and Infirmities, and two hone&s;t Daughters, one a Widow with two Children, the other married to an Husbandman, who had al&s;o been ill, but now, by comfortable Cordials, and good Phy&s;ick, were pretty well, to what they had been.</P>
<P>The two Ladies were well plea&s;ed with my De|meanour to the good Folks: To whom I &s;aid, that as I &s;hould go &s;oon to <HI>London,</HI> I was willing to &s;ee them before I went, to wi&s;h them better and better, and to tell them, that I &s;hould leave Orders with Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> concerning them, to whom they mu&s;t make known their Wants; and that Mr. <HI>Barrow</HI> would take care of 'em, I was
<PB N="352" REF="357">
&s;ure; and do all that was in the Power of Phy&s;ick for the Re&s;toration of their Healths.</P>
<P>Now you mu&s;t know, Mi&s;s, that I am not &s;o good as the old Ladies of former Days, who u&s;ed to di&s;til Cordial Waters, and prepare Medicines, and di&s;pen&s;e them them&s;elves. I knew, if I was &s;o inclined, my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> would not have been plea&s;ed with it, becau&s;e, in the Approbation he has kindly given to my pre&s;ent Method, he has twice or thrice prai&s;ed me, that I don't carry my Cha|rity to Extremes, and make his Hou&s;e a Di&s;pen|&s;atory. I would not, therefore, by aiming at do|ing too much, lo&s;e the Opportunity of doing any Good at all in the&s;e re&s;pects; and be&s;ides, as the vulgar Saying is, One mu&s;t creep before one goes! But this is my Method:</P>
<P>I am upon an Agreement with this Mr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> who is deemed a very skilful and hone&s;t Apothe|cary, and one Mr. <HI>Simmonds,</HI> a Surgeon of like Character, to attend all &s;uch Ca&s;es and Per&s;ons as I &s;hall recommend; Mr. <HI>Barrow</HI> to admini&s;ter Phy&s;ick and Cordials, as he &s;hall judge proper, and even, in nece&s;&s;ary Ca&s;es, to call in a Phy&s;ician. And now-and-then calling one's &s;elf, or &s;ending a Servant to ask Que&s;tions, all is kept right.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, one can take this Method without the O&s;tentation, as &s;ome would deem it, which would attend the other; and having one's dear Friend's Gate always crouded with unhappy Objects, and &s;ome that de&s;erve no Countenance, perhaps, and would po&s;&s;ibly be the mo&s;t clamorous: And then one does not &s;ubject the Poor neither to the In|&s;olence of Servants, who &s;ometimes, in a Body's Ab&s;ence, might, were they &s;ome Servants, &s;hew, that they were far from being influenced by the &s;ame Motives as their Principals: Be&s;ides the Ad|vantage the Poor have from the Skill and Expe|rience
<PB N="353" REF="358">
which Education, and con&s;tant Practice, give to the Gentlemen I imploy; and with whom I agree but by the Quarter, becau&s;e if there were a ju&s;t Foundation of Complaint, for Negligence, or Hard|ne&s;s of Heart, I would not be ty'd down from changing; for, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, in a Cri&s;is, the poor People depending on the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e Gentle|men, might look no farther, and &s;o my good Inten|tions might not only be fru&s;trated, but do Harm.</P>
<P>My Lady <HI>Davers</HI> ob&s;erved a Bible, a Common Prayer Book, and a Whole Duty of Man, in each Cot, in Leathern out&s;ide Ca&s;es, to keep them clean, and a Church Catechi&s;m or two for the Children; and was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, It was right: And her Lady&s;hip asked one of the Children, a pretty Girl, Who learnt her her Catechi&s;m? And &s;he court'&s;y'd, and look'd at me; for I <HI>do</HI> ask the Children Que&s;tions, when I come, to know how they improve: 'Tis as I thought, &s;aid my Lady; my Si&s;ter provides for both Parts. God ble&s;s you, my Dear! &s;aid &s;he, and tapp'd my Neck.</P>
<P>My Ladies left Tokens of their Bounty behind them to both Families, and all the good Folks ble&s;&s;ed and pray'd for us at Parting: And as we went out, my Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> with a &s;erious Air, was plea&s;ed to &s;ay to me, Take care of your Health, my dear Si&s;ter, and God give you, when it comes, a happy Hour; for how many real Mourners would you have, if you were to be called early to reap the Fruits of your Piety?</P>
<P>God's Will mu&s;t be done, my Lady, &s;aid I. The &s;ame Providence that has &s;o wonderfully put it in my Power to do a little Good, will rai&s;e up new Friends to the hone&s;t Hearts that rely upon Him.</P>
<P>This I &s;aid, becau&s;e &s;ome of the good People heard my Lady, and &s;eem'd troubled, and began to redouble their Prayers for my Safety and Pre&s;er|vation.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="359">We walked thence to our Coach, and &s;tretched a little farther, to vi&s;it two Farmers Families, about a Mile di&s;tant from each other. One had the Mo|ther of the Family, with two Sons, ju&s;t recovering, the former from a Fever, the latter from Tertian Agues; and I asked when they &s;aw Mr. <HI>Barrow?</HI> They told me, with great Commendations of him, that he had but ju&s;t left them. So having congratu|lated their hopeful Way, and wi&s;hed them to take care of them&s;elves, and not go too early to Bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;aid, I &s;hould de&s;ire Mr. <HI>Barrow</HI> to watch over them, for fear of Relap&s;e, and &s;hould hardly &s;ee 'em again for &s;ome time; and &s;o, under the Notion of my Foy, I dropt a Couple of Guineas in the good Woman's Hand: For I had had an Hint given me by Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> that their Illne&s;s had made it low with them.</P>
<P>We proceeded then to the other Farm, where the Ca&s;e was a marry'd Daughter, who had had a very dangerous Lying-in, and a wicked Husband, who had abus'd her, and run away from her: But &s;he was mending apace, by good comfortable Things, which from time to time I had cau&s;ed to be &s;ent her. Her old Father had been a little unkind to her, before I took Notice of her; for &s;he marry'd again&s;t his Con|&s;ent; and indeed the World went hard with the poor Man, and he could not do much; and, be&s;ides, he had a younger Daughter, who had lo&s;t all her Limbs, and was forc'd to be ty'd in a Wicker Chair, to keep her up in it; which (having expended much to re|lieve her) was a great Pull-back, as the good old Woman called it. And having been a Year in Ar|rear to a cruel Landlord, who finding a good Stock upon the Ground, wanted to di&s;tre&s;s the poor Family, and turn them out of all, I advanced the Money upon the Stock; and the poor Man has already paid me half of it, (for I mu&s;t keep within Compa&s;s too,
<PB N="355" REF="360">
Mi&s;s) which was 50 <HI>l.</HI> at fir&s;t, and is in a fair Way to pay me the other Half, and make as much more for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here I found Mr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> and he gave me an Account of the Succe&s;s of two other Ca&s;es I had re|commended to him; and told me, that <HI>John Smith,</HI> a poor Man, who, in thatching a Barn, had tumbled down, and broken his Leg, and brui&s;ed him&s;elf all over, was in a fair way of Recovery.</P>
<P>This poor Creature had like to have peri&s;hed by the Cruelty of the Pari&s;h Officers, who would have pa&s;s'd him away to <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> where his Settlement was, tho' in a burning Fever, occa&s;ioned by his Misfor|tune. But hearing of the Ca&s;e, I directed Mr. <HI>Sim|monds</HI> to attend him, and provide for him, at my Ex|pence, and gave my Word, if he dy'd, to bury him.</P>
<P>I was glad to hear he was in &s;o good a way, and told Mr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> I hoped to &s;ee him and Mr. <HI>Simmonds</HI> together at Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s, before I &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> that we might advi&s;e about the Ca&s;es under their Direction, and that I might acquit my&s;elf of &s;ome of my Obligations to them.</P>
<P>You are a good Man, Mr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> added I: God will ble&s;s you for your Care and Kindne&s;s to the&s;e poor de&s;titute Creatures. They all prai&s;e you, and do nothing but talk of your Humanity to them.</P>
<P>O my good Lady, &s;aid he, who can forbear fol|lowing &s;uch an Example as you &s;et? Mr. <HI>Simmonds</HI> can te&s;tify, as well as I, (for now-and-then a Ca&s;e re|quires us to vi&s;it together) that we can hardly hear any Complaints from our poor Patients, let 'em be ever &s;o ill, for the Prai&s;es and Ble&s;&s;ings they be&s;tow upon you.</P>
<P>It is good Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that enables and encourages me to do what I do. Tell them, they mu&s;t ble&s;s God, and ble&s;s him, and pray for me, and thank you and Mr. <HI>Simmonds:</HI> We all join together, you know, for their Good.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="361">The Counte&s;s and Lady <HI>Davers</HI> asked the poor lying-in Woman many Que&s;tions, and left with her, and for her poor Si&s;ter, a mi&s;erable Object indeed! &mdash;(God be prai&s;ed, that I am not &s;uch an one!)

<P>Thus is it well remarked in a Manu&s;cript Poem, in my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, written in An&s;wer to a Friend, who recommended a poor Man of Genius

to the Favour of the Author, in order to induce the benevolent Gentleman to lift him into a higher Life than that to which he was born:

<L>Gouts, Fevers, Surfeits, ev'ry tort'ring Ail,</L>
<L>That our rich Blood infects, on this poor Swain?</L>

</LG></Q></P>
<P>I mention'd before <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this <HI>Vol.</HI> p. <HI>288.</HI></NOTE>, that this Poem had given me &s;ome proper Hints, in relation to the Good one &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e, in which one ought to con&s;ult a Per&s;on's u&s;ual way of Life, and not to be &s;o lavi&s;h to &s;ome one Object or two, as &s;hould limit one's Power to relieve others, and, at the &s;ame time, by lifting the poor Folks into a State they had not been u&s;ed to, make them po&s;&s;ibly more unhappy than ever. I will tran&s;cribe a few more Lines from this Piece, for your Entertainment:
<Q><L>&mdash;But yet, my Friend, I cannot join with thee,</L>
<L>To think &s;o hard of <HI>native</HI> Poverty.</L>
<L>'Tis not to live at Ea&s;e, makes Happine&s;s,</L>
<L>Eat and drink well, lie &s;oft. 'Tis nothing le&s;s</L>
<L>Than &s;weet <HI>CONTENT,</HI> whatever be the State,</L>
<L>Can make us truly happy, wi&s;e or great.</L>
<L><PB N="358" REF="363">If <HI>this</HI> he want not, whate'er el&s;e he be,</L>
<L>He's happier far, I judge, than You or Me:</L>
<L>And if he <HI>want</HI> it, much I fear, my friend,</L>
<L>He'll find <HI>no State</HI> will his Condition mend,</L>
<L>For human Minds, &s;till on a&s;piring bent,</L>
<L>Not check'd at fir&s;t, are &s;eldom e'er content.</L></Q></P>
<P>And again:
<Q><L>The Man who in one Way was always bred</L>
<L>Till thrice Twelve Winters have pa&s;s'd o'er his Head&punc;</L>
<L><HI>Is,</HI> or <HI>&s;hould</HI> be, contented with his Fate,</L>
<L>Nor covet <HI>totally</HI> to change his State.</L>
<L>For Di&s;content once cheri&s;h'd in his Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>De&s;ire of Change will never let him re&s;t,</L>
<L>Unfix'd, un&s;ettled, he, all Comfort pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Knows his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Wi&s;h; but ne'er will know his <HI>la&s;t.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t go on a little further. It &s;eems that the re|commending Friend had prai&s;ed the poor Man for a Genius above the Sphere he was placed in. To this the judicious Benefactor replies, &s;tating the Plea in the fir&s;t Line:
<Q><LG>
<L>But he has Parts and Wit above his Sphere;</L>
<L>The neighb'ring Throng will then his Wit revere,</L>
<L>If by &s;ound Judgment temper'd. And who knows</L>
<L>How u&s;eful he may be, but to compo&s;e</L>
<L>Small Strifes, that even homely Cots invade</L>
<L>From rugged Minds by partial Pa&s;&s;ions &s;way'd?</L>
<L>Shall nought but Thi&s;tles in one Climate grow?</L>
<L>And, intermingling, no &s;weet Ro&s;es blow?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Remote from Towns, among the rural Swains,</L>
<L>He'll be the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of the Plains:</L>
<L><PB N="359" REF="364">And nothing &s;ure, on Earth, yields more Delight,</L>
<L>Than diff'ring Minds in &s;ocial Bands t'unite.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>I believe you'll excu&s;e me, if I tran&s;cribe more:
<Q><LG>
<L>We the Di&s;comforts know of what we <HI>are,</HI></L>
<L>But little think what States <HI>&s;uperior</HI> &s;hare:</L>
<L>How aukwardly our Parts we &s;hould &s;u&s;tain</L>
<L>In a new Scene. And, Oh! what mighty Pain</L>
<L>(For this is not the lea&s;t) t' a gen'rous Mind,</L>
<L>With Obligations pre&s;s'd, or to Dependence join'd!</L>
<L>Or &s;it they light from <HI>me,</HI> as e'er they will,</L>
<L>'Tis Obligation and Dependence &s;till</L>
<L>To thoughtful Minds&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And grant he might be happy while I live,</L>
<L>How may he fare with tho&s;e who me &s;urvive?</L>
<L>My Fortune may, perhaps, to tho&s;e de&s;cend,</L>
<L>Who knew not <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> nor lov'd <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Friend;</L>
<L>Who, like too many Heirs, rever&s;e whate'er</L>
<L>Was wont t' engage their Predece&s;&s;ors Care.</L>
<L>In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, what Cau&s;e he'd have to mourn,</L>
<L>Forc'd to the Life he <HI>now</HI> beholds with Scorn</L>
<L>(By long Di&s;u&s;e, made &s;till <HI>more</HI> grievous) to return?</L>
<L>Shall the &s;low <HI>Cart-hor&s;e</HI> with the <HI>Cour&s;er</HI> run?</L>
<L>Wou'd ev'ry twinkling <HI>Star</HI> become a <HI>Sun?</HI></L>
<L>Yet in their Order, <HI>this</HI> adorns the Sky,</L>
<L>And <HI>that</HI> helps on the gen'ral Harmony.</L>

<HEAD>SATURDAY Morning.</HEAD>
<P>IT is hardly right to trouble either of you, my honoured Corre&s;pondents, with an Affair, that has vex'd me a good deal, and indeed <HI>&s;hould</HI> affect me more than any other Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Family, for Rea|&s;ons which will be obvious to you, when I tell you the Ca&s;e. And this (it is &s;o pre&s;ent with me) I cannot forbear.</P>
<P>A pretty genteel young Body, my <HI>Polly Barlow,</HI> as I call her, having been well recommended, and indeed behaved with great Prudence till this time, is the Occa&s;ion. And this it is:</P>
<P>My dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and the Two Ladies agreed with me to take a little Airing in the Coach, and to fall in upon Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> who had a Pre&s;ent made him for his Menagerie, in which he takes great Delight,
<PB N="362" REF="367">
of a rare and uncommon Creature, a Native of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> But ju&s;t as Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> was on Hor&s;e|back to accompany them, and the Ladies were ready to go, I was taken with a &s;udden Di&s;order and Fainti&s;hne&s;s, &s;o that Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> who is very tender of me, and watches every Turn of my Coun|tenance, would not let me go with them, tho' my Di&s;order was going off, and my dear Mr. <HI>B.</HI> was plea&s;ed to excu&s;e me; and ju&s;t meeting with Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> as they went to the Coach, they took him with them, to fill up the vacant Place. So I retir'd to my Clo&s;et, and &s;hut my&s;elf in.</P>
<P>They had asked Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to go with them, as Com|pany to Sir <HI>Jacob</HI>; but he (as I believe, by what fol|lowed, on purpo&s;e) could not be found, when they &s;et out: So they &s;uppo&s;ed he was upon &s;ome Ramble with Mr. <HI>Colbrand,</HI> his great Favourite.</P>
<P>I was writing to <HI>you,</HI> being pretty well recover'd, when I heard <HI>Polly,</HI> as I &s;uppo&s;ed, and as it proved, come into my Apartment; and down &s;he &s;at, and &s;ung a little Catch, and cry'd Hem! twice; and pre&s;ently I heard two Voices. But &s;u&s;pecting no|thing, I wrote on, till I heard a kind of Ru&s;tling and Struggling, and <HI>Polly</HI>'s Voice crying, Fie! &mdash; How can you do &s;o! &mdash; Pray, Sir!</P>
<P>This alarm'd me much, becau&s;e we have &s;uch orderly Folks about us; and I looked thro' the Key|hole, and, to my Surprize and Concern, &s;aw Mr. <HI>H.</HI>&mdash; fooli&s;h Gentleman! &mdash; taking Liberties with <HI>Polly,</HI> that neither became him to offer, nor, more fooli&s;h Girl! her to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>I did not know what to do: But having Rea&s;on to think, that this was not their fir&s;t Interview and Freedom &mdash; and the Girl &s;ometimes encouragingly laughing, as at other times, incon&s;i&s;tently, &s;truggling and complaining, in an Accent that was too tender for the Occa&s;ion, I forced a faint Cough. This

frighted them both: Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;wore, and &s;aid, Who can that be? &mdash; Your Lady's gone with them, i'n't &s;he?</P>
<P>I believe &s;o! I hope &s;o! &s;aid the &s;illy Girl &mdash; Yet that was like her Voice! &mdash; Me'm, are you in your Clo&s;et, Me'm? &s;aid &s;he, coming up to the Door, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;tanding, like a poor Thief, half behind the Window-curtains, till he knew if it was I.</P>
<P>I open'd the Door; away &s;neak'd Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and &s;he leap'd with Surprize, not hoping to find me there, tho' &s;he asked the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I thought&mdash; Indeed &mdash; Me'm&mdash;I thought you were gone out.</P>
<P>It is plain you did, <HI>Polly!</HI> &mdash; Go and &s;hut the Chamber-door, and come to me again.</P>
<P>She did, but trembled, and was &s;o full of Con|fu&s;ion, that I pity'd the poor Creature, and hardly knew how to &s;peak to her, or what to &s;ay. &mdash; For my Compa&s;&s;ion got the Upper-hand of my Re&s;ent|ment; and as &s;he &s;tood quaking and trembling, and looking on the Ground, with a Countenance I can|not de&s;cribe, I now-and-then ca&s;t my Eye upon her, and was as often forced to put my Handkerchief to it.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I &s;aid, How long have the&s;e Freedoms pa&s;t, <HI>Polly,</HI> between you and Mr. <HI>H.?</HI></P>
<P>She &s;aid never a Word.</P>
<P>I am loth to be cen&s;orious, <HI>Polly:</HI> But 'tis too plain, that Mr. <HI>H.</HI> would not have followed you into my Chamber, if he had not met you at other Places before.</P>
<P>Still the poor Girl &s;aid never a Word.</P>
<P>Little did I expect, <HI>Polly,</HI> that you would have &s;hewn &s;o much Imprudence. You have had In|&s;tances of the vile Arts of Men again&s;t poor Maidens: Have you any Notion, that Mr. <HI>H.</HI> intends to do honourably by you?</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="369">Me'm&mdash;Me'm&mdash;I believe&mdash;I hope&mdash;I dare &s;ay, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> would not do otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P>She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Tell me, <HI>Polly,</HI> if he does?</P>
<P>He &s;ays, he will do honourably by me.</P>
<P>But you know there is but one Word nece&s;&s;ary to explain that other precious Word <HI>Honour,</HI> in this Ca&s;e. It is <HI>Matrimony.</HI> That Word's as &s;oon &s;poken as any other, and if he <HI>means</HI> it, he will not be &s;hy to <HI>&s;peak</HI> it.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Tell me, <HI>Polly,</HI> (for I am really greatly concern'd for you) what you think your&s;elf: Do you <HI>hope</HI> he will marry you?</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Do, good <HI>Polly,</HI> I hope I may call you <HI>good</HI> yet!&mdash; an&s;wer me.</P>
<P>Pray, Madam! and &s;he wept, and turn'd from me, to the Wain&s;cot&mdash;Pray, Madam, excu&s;e me.</P>
<P>But, indeed, <HI>Polly,</HI> I <HI>cannot</HI> excu&s;e you. You are under my Protection. I was once in as dan|gerous a Situation as you can be. And I did not e&s;cape it, Child, by the Language and Conduct I heard from you.</P>
<P>Language and Conduct, Me'm!</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>Polly,</HI> Language and Conduct. For you have heard my Story, no doubt: All the World has. And do you think, if I had &s;at me down in my Lady's Bedchamber, and &s;ung a Song, and hem'd twice, and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had come to me, upon that Signal, (for &s;uch I doubt it was) and I had kept my Place, and &s;uf|fer'd my&s;elf to be rumpled, and only, in a &s;oft Voice, and with an encouraging Laugh, cry'd, How can you do &s;o? that I &s;hould have been what I am?</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="370">Me'm, I dare &s;ay, my Lord (&s;o all the Servants call him, and his Aunt often, when &s;he puts <HI>Jackey</HI> to it) means me no Hurt.</P>
<P>No Hurt, <HI>Polly!</HI> What, and make you cry <HI>Fie!</HI>&mdash; Or do you intend to tru&s;t your Honour to his Mercy, rather than to your own Di&s;cretion?</P>
<P>I hope not, Me'm!</P>
<P>I hope not too, <HI>Polly!</HI>&mdash;But you know he was free enough with you, to make you &s;ay <HI>Fie!</HI>&mdash;And what might have been the Ca&s;e, who knows? had I not coughed on Purpo&s;e; unwilling for your &s;ake, <HI>Polly,</HI> to find Matters &s;o bad as I feared, and that you would have been led beyond what was reputa|ble?</P>
<P>Reputable, Me'm!</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>Polly,</HI> Reputable: I am &s;orry you oblige me to &s;peak &s;o plain. But your Good requires it. In&s;tead of flying from him, you not only laughed all the time you cry'd out, <HI>Fie!</HI> and <HI>How can you do &s;o?</HI> but had no other Care then to &s;ee if any body heard you; and you ob&s;erve how he &s;lid away, like a guilty Gentleman, as &s;oon as I open'd my Door&mdash;Do the&s;e Things look well, <HI>Polly?</HI> Do you think they do?&mdash;And if you hope to emu|late my good Fortune, do you think <HI>this</HI> is the Way?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Me'm, I had never &s;een Mr. <HI>H.</HI> For nobody will look upon me, if I lo&s;e your Fa|vour!</P>
<P>It will &s;till, <HI>Polly,</HI> (and I took her Hand, with a kind Look) be in your own Power to keep it; and I will not mention this Matter, if you make me your Friend, and tell me all that has pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Again &s;he wept, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>This made me more unea&s;y. Don't think, <HI>Polly,</HI> &s;aid I, that I would envy any other Per&s;on's Preferment, when I have been &s;o much exalted

<P>Indeed, Me'm&mdash;Indeed, &s;aid &s;he, &s;obbing, I might be too little upon my Guard; but I would not have done any Ill for the World.</P>

<P>He is a very good-humour'd Gentleman, Madam, and is not proud.</P>
<P>No, 'tis not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to be proud, when he hopes to humble you&mdash;Humble you indeed! Beneath the lowe&s;t Per&s;on of the Sex, that is hone&s;t.</P>
<P>I hope&mdash;</P>

<P>In private, Me'm!&mdash;I don't know what your Lady&s;hip calls <HI>private!</HI></P>
<P>Why that is <HI>private, Polly,</HI> when, as ju&s;t now, you neither hoped nor intended any body &s;hould &s;ee you.</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent; and I &s;ee, Mi&s;s, by this poor Girl, that Lovers are true to their Secret, tho' per|haps, their Ruin depends upon it. But it behov'd
<PB N="367" REF="372">
<HI>me,</HI> on more Accounts than it would any body el&s;e, as I hinted before, to examine this Matter narrowly; becau&s;e, if Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;hould marry her, it would have been laid upon Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Example&mdash; And if my <HI>Polly</HI> &s;hould be ruin'd, it would be a &s;ad thing; and People would have &s;aid, Ay, &s;he could take Care enough of her&s;elf; but none at all of her Servant: <HI>Her</HI> Waiting-maid had a much more remi&s;s Mi&s;tre&s;s, than <HI>Pamela</HI> found, or the Matter would not have been thus.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Polly,</HI> I &s;ee, continued I, that you will not &s;peak out to me. You may have <HI>&s;everal</HI> Rea|&s;ons for it, po&s;&s;ibly, tho' not <HI>one</HI> good one.

<P>The poor Girl, frighted at this, (for every body fears Lady <HI>Davers</HI>) wrung her Hands, and begg'd, for God's Sake, I would not acquaint Lady <HI>Davers</HI> with it.</P>
<P>But how can I help it? &s;aid I &mdash; Mu&s;t I not connive at your Proceedings, if I do not? You are no Fool, <HI>Polly,</HI> in other Ca&s;es. Tell me, How is it po&s;&s;ible for me, in my Situation, to avoid it?</P>
<P>I will tell your Lady&s;hip the whole Truth; in|deed I will&mdash;if you will not tell Lady <HI>Davers.</HI> I am ready to &s;ink at the Thoughts of Lady <HI>Davers</HI>' knowing any thing of this.</P>
<P>This looked &s;adly. I pity'd her, but yet was an|gry in my Mind; for I &s;aw too plainly, that her Conduct could not bear a Scrutiny, not even in <HI>her own</HI> Opinion, poor Creature!</P>

<P>Why then, Madam&mdash;But how can I &s;peak it?&mdash;I can &s;peak &s;ooner to any body, but Lady <HI>Davers</HI> and you, Madam&mdash;For her Lady&s;hip's Pa&s;&s;ion, and your Lady&s;hip's Virtue &mdash; How &s;hall I? &mdash; And then &s;he threw her&s;elf at my Feet, and hid her Face with her Apron.</P>
<P>I was in Agonies for her almo&s;t; I wept over her; I rai&s;ed her up, and &s;aid, Tell me all&mdash;You can|not tell me wor&s;e than I apprehend, nor, I hope, &s;o bad! O <HI>Polly,</HI> tell me &s;oon&mdash;For you give me great Pain&mdash;</P>
<P>And my Back, with Grief and Compa&s;&s;ion for the poor Girl, was ready to open, as it &s;eem'd to me&mdash;In my former Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, I have been overcome by Fainting next to Death, and was depriv'd of Sen&s;e for &s;ome Moments&mdash;But el&s;e I &s;hould have imagin'd, I mu&s;t have had &s;ome &s;uch affecting Sen|&s;ations, as the unhappy Girl's Ca&s;e gave me.</P>
<P>Then, Madam, I own, &s;aid &s;he, I have been too faulty.</P>

<P>No, Madam, but&mdash;</P>
<P>But, what?&mdash;Say, but what?</P>
<P>I had con&s;ented&mdash;</P>
<P>To what?</P>
<P>To his Propo&s;als, Madam.</P>
<P>What Propo&s;als?</P>
<P>Why, Madam, I was to <HI>live</HI> with Mr. <HI>H.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="374">I under&s;tand you too well&mdash;But is it too late to break &s;o wretched a Bargain?&mdash;Have you already made a Sacrifice of your Honour?</P>

<P>Under your <HI>Hand!</HI>&mdash;Ah! <HI>Polly,</HI> if you have not given it under your <HI>Heart</HI> too, it were well. But what Fooli&s;hne&s;s is this! What Con&s;ideration has he made you?</P>
<P>He has given it under his Hand, that he will al|ways love me, and when his Lord&s;hip's Father dies, he will own me.</P>
<P>What Fooli&s;hne&s;s is this, &s;aid I, on both &s;ides! &mdash;But are you willing to be relea&s;ed from this vile Bargain?</P>
<P>Indeed I am, Madam, and I told him &s;o Ye&s;ter|day. But, he &s;ays, he will &s;ue me, and ruin me, if I don't &s;tand to it.</P>
<P>You are ruin'd if you do!&mdash;And I wi&s;h&mdash; But tell me, <HI>Polly,</HI> Are you not ruin'd as it is?</P>
<P>Indeed I am not, Madam.</P>
<P>I doubt then, &s;aid I, you were upon the Brink of it, had not this providential Indi&s;po&s;ition kept me at home&mdash;You met, I &s;uppo&s;e, to conclude your &s;hocking Bargain.&mdash;O poor unhappy Girl!&mdash;But let me &s;ee what he has given under his Hand?</P>
<P>He has 'em both, Madam, to be drawn up fair, and in a &s;trong Hand, that &s;hall be like a Record.</P>
<P>Could I have thought, Mi&s;s, that a Girl of Nine|teen could be &s;o ignorant and fooli&s;h in a Point &s;o important, when in every thing el&s;e &s;he has &s;hewn no In&s;tances like this imprudent Folly?</P>
<P>Has he given you Money?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, he gave me&mdash;he gave me&mdash;a Note. Here it is. He &s;ays any body will give me Money for it.</P>
<P>And this was a Bank Note of 50 <HI>l.</HI> which &s;he pulled out of her Bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="375">I in&s;tantly thought of tho&s;e Lines of <HI>Cowley,</HI> which my dear Lady &s;everal times made me read to her; tho' the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed an infinitely more excu&s;e|able Ca&s;e&mdash;<HI>Marriage</HI> for Money.</P>
<Q><L>Take Heed, take Heed, thou lovely Maid!</L>

<L>What Dangers ought'&s;t thou not to dread,</L>

<P>The Re&s;ult was, He was to &s;ettle 100 <HI>l.</HI> a Year upon her and <HI>hers,</HI> poor, poor Girl!&mdash;And he was to <HI>own her,</HI> as &s;he calls it (but as Wife or Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;tipulated not) when his Father dy'd, and he came into the Title and E&s;tate.</P>
<P>I told her, It was impo&s;&s;ible for me to conceal the Matter from Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> if &s;he would not, by her Promi&s;es to be govern'd intirely by me, and to abandon all Thoughts of Mr. <HI>H.</HI> give me room to conclude, that the wicked Bargain was at an End.</P>
<P>And to keep the poor Soul in &s;ome Spirits, and to enable her to look up, and to be more ea&s;y under my Direction, I blamed <HI>him</HI> more than I did <HI>her:</HI> Tho', con&s;idering what Virtue requires of a Woman, and Cu&s;tom has made &s;hamele&s;s in a Man, I think the poor Girl inexcu&s;eable, and &s;hall not be ea&s;y while &s;he is about me. For &s;he is more to blame, becau&s;e, of the two, &s;he has more Wit than the Man.</P>
<P>But what can I do, Mi&s;s, if I put her away? 'Twill be to throw her directly into his Hands. He won't &s;tay long; and &s;he <HI>may</HI> &s;ee her Folly. But here her Eyes were open; She knew what &s;he had to tru&s;t to&mdash;And by their wicked Beginning, and
<PB N="371" REF="376">
her encouraging Repul&s;es, I doubt &s;he would have been utterly ruin'd that very Day.</P>
<P>I knew the Rage Lady <HI>Davers</HI> would be in with both. So this was another Embara&s;s. And yet, &s;hould my good Intentions be fru&s;trated, and they &s;hould conclude their vile Bargain, and it appear'd that I knew of it, but would not acquaint her, then &s;hould I have been blam'd more than any Mi&s;tre&s;s of a Fa|mily, being circum&s;tanc'd as I am.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, As to the Girl, I re&s;olv'd to comfort her as well as I could, till I had gain'd her Confidence, that my Advice might have the more Weight with her, and by Degrees be the more likely to reclaim her: For, poor Soul! there would be an End of her Reputation, the mo&s;t precious of all Jewels, the Moment the Matter was known; and that would be a &s;ad thing.</P>
<P>And as to the Man, I thought it be&s;t to take Cou|rage (and you that know me, will &s;ay, I mu&s;t have a good deal more than u&s;ual) to talk to Mr. <HI>H.</HI> on this Subject.</P>
<P>And the poor Body con&s;enting I &s;hould, and, with great Prote&s;tations, declaring her Sorrow and Repentance, begging me to get her Note of Hand again, on which &s;he laid a fooli&s;h Stre&s;s, and de&s;iring me to give him back his Note of 50 <HI>l.</HI> I went down to find him.</P>
<P>He &s;hunn'd me, as a Thief would a Con&s;table at the Head of a Hue and Cry. As I entered one Place or Room, he went into another, looking with con&s;cious Guilt, but yet confidently humming a Tune. At la&s;t I fixed him &s;peaking to <HI>Rachel,</HI> bid|ding her tell <HI>Polly,</HI> he wanted to &s;end a Me&s;&s;age by her to her Lady. By which I doubted not, he was de&s;irous to know what &s;he had owned, in or|der to govern him&s;elf accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="377">His Back was toward me; and I &s;aid, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> here I am my&s;elf, to take your Commands.</P>
<P>He gave a Caper half a Yard high&mdash;Madam, I wanted&mdash;I wanted to &s;peak to&mdash;I would have &s;poken with&mdash;</P>
<P>You wanted to &s;end <HI>Polly</HI> to me, perhaps, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to ask if I would take a little Walk with you in the Garden?</P>
<P>Very true, Madam!&mdash;Very true indeed!&mdash;You have gue&s;s'd the Matter&mdash;I thought it was pity, this fine Day, as every body was taking an Airing&mdash;</P>
<P>Well then, Sir, plea&s;e to lead the Way, and I'll attend you.</P>
<P>Yet I fan&s;y, Madam, the Wind is a little too high for you&mdash;Won't you catch Cold?</P>
<P>No, never fear, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> I am not afraid of a little Air.</P>
<P>I will attend you pre&s;ently, Madam: You'll be in the great Gravel Walk, or on the Terrace&mdash;I'll wait upon you in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>I had the Courage to take hold of his Arm, as if I had like to have &s;lipt; For, thought I, thou &s;halt not &s;ee the Girl, worthy Friend, till I have talk'd to thee a little, if thou do&s;t then &mdash;Excu&s;e me, Mr. <HI>H.</HI>&mdash; I hope I have not hurt my Foot!&mdash;I mu&s;t lean upon you.</P>
<P>Will you be pleas'd, Madam, to have a Chair? I fear you have &s;prain'd your Foot&mdash;Shall I help you to a Chair?</P>
<P>No, no, Sir, I &s;hall walk it off, if I hold by you.</P>
<P>So he had no Excu&s;e to leave me, and we proceed|ed into the Garden. But never did any thing look &s;o &s;illy!&mdash;So like a <HI>fooli&s;h Fellow,</HI> as his Aunt calls him. He looked, if po&s;&s;ible, half a dozen Ways at once, hem'd, cough'd, wriggled about, turn'd his Head behind him every now-and-then, and &s;tarted

half a dozen &s;illy Subjects, in hopes to hinder me from &s;peaking.</P>
<P>I appear'd, I believe, under &s;ome Concern how to begin with him; for he would have it, I was not very well, and begg'd he might &s;tep in one Minute, to de&s;ire Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> to attend me.</P>
<P>So I re&s;olved to begin with him, le&s;t I &s;hould lo&s;e the Opportunity, &s;eeing my Eel &s;o very &s;lippery. And placing my&s;elf at the Seat at the upper End of the Gravel Walk, I asked him to &s;it down. He de|clined it, and would wait upon me pre&s;ently, he &s;aid, and &s;eemed going. So I began&mdash;It is ea&s;y for me, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to penetrate the Rea&s;on why you are &s;o willing to leave me: But 'tis for your <HI>own</HI> Sake, that I de&s;ire you to hear me, that no Mi&s;chief may en&s;ue among Friends and Relations, on an Occa|&s;ion to which you are no Stranger.</P>
<P>Lord, Madam, What can you mean?&mdash;Surely, Madam, you don't think ami&s;s of a little innocent Liberty, or &s;o!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> reply'd I, I want not any Evidence of your inho&s;pitable De&s;igns upon a poor unwary young Creature, whom your Birth and Quality have found it too ea&s;y a Task to influence.</P>
<P><HI>Inho&s;pitable De&s;igns,</HI> Madam!&mdash;A har&s;h Word, by Gad!&mdash;You very nice Ladies cannot admit of the lea&s;t Freedom in the World!&mdash;Why, Madam, I have ki&s;s'd a Lady's Woman before now, in a civil way or &s;o, and never was call'd to an Account for it, as a Breach of Ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>'Tis not for me, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;aid I, to proceed to <HI>very nice</HI> Particulars with a Gentleman who can act as you have done, by a poor Girl, that could not have had the A&s;&s;urance to look up to a Man of your Qua|lity, had you not levell'd all Di&s;tinction between you, in order to level the weak Creature to the com|mon Dirt of the Highway.

<P>Has &s;he told you that, Madam?&mdash;Why may-be&mdash; indeed&mdash;I can't but &s;ay&mdash;Truly it mayn't look &s;o well to you, Madam: But young Folks will have Frolicks&mdash;It was nothing but a Frolick&mdash;Let me <HI>be hang'd,</HI> if it was!</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed then, Sir, to give up her Note to me to return to her&mdash;Reputation &s;hould not be frolick'd with, Sir; e&s;pecially that of a poor Girl, who has nothing el&s;e to depend upon.</P>
<P>I'll give it to her my&s;elf, and laugh at her into the Bargain, if you plea&s;e, Madam. Why, 'tis comical enough, if the little Pug thought I was in Earne&s;t. I mu&s;t have a Laugh or two at her, Madam, when I give it her up.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;aid I, &s;ince 'tis but a Frolick, you won't take it ami&s;s, that when we are &s;et down to Supper, we call <HI>Polly</HI> in, and demand a Sight of her Note, and that will make every one merry, as well as you.</P>
<P>Cot-&s;o, Madam, that mayn't be &s;o well neither! &mdash;For, perhaps, they will be apt to think it is in Earne&s;t; when, as I hope to live, 'tis but a Je&s;t: No|thing in the World el&s;e, upon Honour!</P>

I was talking to a Gentleman, that would not for|feit his Veracity; and that in &s;o &s;olemn an In&s;tance as this!</P>

<P>At la&s;t he &s;aid, I am confoundedly betrayed.

<P>Ungenerous, contemptible Wretch, thought I!&mdash; But our Sex that can thus give up their Virtue, ought to expect no better: For he that &s;ticks not at <HI>one</HI> bad Action, will not &s;cruple <HI>another</HI> to vindicate him&s;elf: And &s;o, Devil-like, become the Tempter, and the Accu&s;er too!</P>
<P>But if you will be &s;o good, &s;aid he, as to take no Notice of this, to my Uncle, and e&s;pecially to my Aunt and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I &s;wear to you, I never will think of her as long as I live.</P>
<P>And you'll bind this Promi&s;e, will you, Sir? by <HI>your Honour,</HI> and as you <HI>hope to live!</HI></P>
<P>Dear, good Madam, forgive me, I be&s;eech you; Don't be &s;o &s;evere upon me. By all that's&mdash;</P>
<P>Don't &s;wear, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> But as an Earne&s;t that I may believe you, give me back the Girl's fooli&s;h Note, that, tho' 'tis of no Signification, &s;he may not have <HI>that</HI> to witne&s;s to her Folly.</P>
<P>He took out his Pocket-Book: There it is, Ma|dam!&mdash;And I beg you'll forgive this Attempt. I &s;ee, I ought not to have made it. I doubt it was a Breach
<PB N="376" REF="381">
of the Laws of Ho&s;pitality, as you &s;ay. But to make it known, will only expo&s;e me, and it can do no Good; and Mr. <HI>B.</HI> will re&s;ent it, may-be; and my Aunt will never let me hear the la&s;t of it, nor my Uncle neither&mdash;And I &s;hall be &s;ent to travel again&mdash;And (added the poor Creature) I was once in a Storm, and the cro&s;&s;ing the Sea again, would be Death to me.</P>
<P>What a Wretch art thou, thought I!&mdash;What could &s;uch an one as thou find to &s;ay to a poor Creature, that, if put in the Scale again&s;t Virtue and Honour, &s;hould make the latter kick the Beam? &mdash;Poor, poor <HI>Polly Barlow!</HI> thou art &s;unk indeed! Too low for Excu&s;e, and almo&s;t beneath Pity!</P>
<P>I told him, if I could ob&s;erve, that nothing pa&s;s'd between them, that &s;hould lay me under a Nece&s;&s;ity of revealing the Matter, I &s;hould not be forward to expo&s;e him, nor the Maiden either. But that he mu&s;t, in his own Judgment, excu&s;e me, if I made every body acquainted with it, if I were to &s;ee the Corre|&s;pondence between them likely to be renewed or carried on: For, added, in that Ca&s;e, I &s;hould owe it to my&s;elf, to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to Lord and Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and to you, and the unhappy Body too, to do &s;o.</P>
<P>He would needs drop down on one Knee to promi&s;e this; and, with a thou&s;and Acknowlege|ments, left me, to find Mr. <HI>Colbrand,</HI> in order to ride to meet the Coach on its Return.</P>
<P>I went in, and gave the fooli&s;h Note to the &s;illy Girl, which &s;he receiv'd eagerly, and immediately burnt; and I told her, I would not &s;uffer her to come near me but as little as po&s;&s;ible, when I was in Com|pany, while Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;taid; but con&s;igned her in|tirely to the Care of Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> to whom only, I &s;aid, I would hint the Matter as tenderly as I could: And for this, I added, I had more Rea&s;ons than one; Fir&s;t, To give her the Benefit of a good Gen|tlewoman's
<PB N="377" REF="382">
Advice, to which I had my&s;elf formerly been beholden, and from whom I concealed no|thing: Next, To keep her out of Mr. <HI>H.</HI>'s Way: And la&s;tly, That I might have an Opportunity, from Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Opinion, to judge of the Sin|cerity of her Repentance: For, <HI>Polly,</HI> &s;aid I, you mu&s;t imagine, &s;o regular and uniform as all our Family is, and &s;o good as I thought all the People about me were, that I could not &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he, the Duties of who&s;e Place made her neare&s;t to my Per&s;on, was the farthe&s;t from what I wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I have &s;et this Matter &s;o &s;trongly before her, and Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> has &s;o well &s;econded me, that I hope the be&s;t; for the Grief the poor Creature carries in her Looks, and expre&s;&s;es in her Words, cannot be de&s;cribed; frequently accu&s;ing her&s;elf with Tears, &s;aying often to Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> She is not worthy to &s;tand in the Pre&s;ence of a Mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e Example &s;he has made &s;o bad an U&s;e of, and who&s;e Le&s;&s;ons &s;he had &s;o ill followed.</P>
<P>I am &s;adly troubled at this Matter however; but I take great Comfort in reflecting, that my &s;udden Indi&s;po&s;ition look'd like a providential Thing, which may &s;ave one poor Soul, and be a &s;ea&s;onable Warn|ing to her, as long as &s;he lives.</P>
<P>Mean time I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that at Supper la&s;t Night, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> look'd abject, and mean, and like a poor Thief, as I thought; and (con&s;cious of his di&s;appointed Folly, tho' I &s;eldom glanc'd my Eye upon him) had le&s;s to &s;ay for him&s;elf than ever.</P>
<P>And once my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> laughing, &s;aid, I think in my Heart, my Nephew looks more fooli&s;h every time I &s;ee him, than the la&s;t.</P>
<P>He &s;tole a Look at me, and blu&s;h'd; and my Lord &s;aid, <HI>Jackey</HI> has &s;ome Grace!&mdash;He blu&s;hes! &mdash;Hold up thy Head, Nephew! &mdash; Ha&s;t thou no|thing at all to &s;ay for thy&s;elf?</P>

<P>What a &s;ad Thing it is for a Per&s;on to be guilty of &s;uch Actions, as &s;hall put it into the Power of another, even by a Look, to mortify him!

<HEAD>SATURDAY Evening.</HEAD>
<P>I AM ju&s;t retired from a kind of fatiguing Service; for who &s;hould come hither to dine with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> but that &s;ad Rake Sir <HI>Charles Hargrave,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Walgrave,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Floyd,</HI> three as bad as him&s;elf; in&s;eparable Companions, who&s;e whole

Delight, and that avowedly, is Drinking, and Hunt|ing, and Lewdne&s;s; but otherwi&s;e, Gentlemen of Wit, and large E&s;tates? Three of them broke in upon us, at the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 178.</NOTE> Hall, on the happie&s;t Day of my Life, to our great Regret; and they had been long threatening to make this Vi&s;it, in order to &s;ee me, as they told Mr. <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>They whipt out two Bottles of <HI>Champaign</HI> in&s;tant|ly, for a <HI>Whet,</HI> as they called it, and went to view the Stud, and the Kennel, and then took a Walk in the Garden till Dinner was ready; my Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> as well as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> (for they are all acquainted) accompanying them.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> it &s;eems, as Lord <HI>Davers</HI> told me afterwards, &s;aid, He long'd to &s;ee Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> She was the Talk where-ever he went, and he had conceiv'd an high Opinion of her before-hand.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Davers</HI> &s;aid, I defy you, Gentlemen, to think &s;o highly of her as &s;he de&s;erves, take Mind and Per&s;on together.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Floyd</HI> &s;aid, He never &s;aw any Woman yet, that came up to what he expected, where Fame had been lavi&s;h in her Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But how, Brother Baronet, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles</HI> to Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> came <HI>you</HI> to be reconcil'd to her?&mdash;I heard that you would never own her.</P>
<P>Oons, Man, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> I was taken in &mdash; I was, by my Soul! &mdash; They contrived to clap her up|on me, as Lady <HI>Jenny C.</HI> and pretended they'd keep t'other out of my Sight; and I was plaguily bit, and forced to get off as well as I could.</P>
<P>That was a Bite indeed, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Walgrave</HI>; and &s;o you fell a prai&s;ing Lady <HI>Jenny,</HI> I warrant, to the Skies!</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="385">Ye&mdash;as,&mdash; by my Soul, (drawling out the affirma|tive Mono&s;yllable) I was u&s;ed mo&s;t &s;curvily; 'faith I was.&mdash;I bear 'em a Grudge for't &s;till, I can tell 'em that; &mdash; for I have hardly been able to hold up my Head like a Man ever &s;ince&mdash;but am forc'd to &s;neak about, and go, and come, and do as they bid me. By my Troth, I never was &s;o manageable in my Life.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Hereford&s;hire</HI> Neighbours, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> with an Oath, will rejoice to hear this; for the whole County there cannot manage you.</P>
<P>I'm quite cow'd now, by my Soul, as you will &s;ee by-and-by: Nay, for that Matter, if you can &s;et Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> a talking, there's ne'er a Puppy of you all will care to open your Lips, except to &s;ay as &s;he &s;ays.</P>
<P>Never fear, old Boy, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> we'll bear our Parts in Conver&s;ation. I never &s;aw the Woman yet, that could give me either Awe or Love for &s;ix Minutes together. What think <HI>you,</HI> Mr. <HI>B.?</HI> Have you any Notion, that your Lady will have &s;o much Power over us?</P>
<P>I think, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> I have one of the fine&s;t Wo|men in <HI>England</HI>; but I neither expect nor de&s;ire you Rakes &s;hould &s;ee her with my Eyes.</P>
<P>You know, if I have a Mind to love her, and make Court to her too, Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I will: And I am half in Love with her already, altho' I have not &s;een her.</P>
<P>They came in when Dinner was near ready, and the Four Gentlemen took each a large Bumper of Old Hock for another Whet.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and I, came down together. The Gentlemen knew our two noble Gue&s;ts, and were known to them in Per&s;on, as well as by Character. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> in his u&s;ual kind and en|couraging Manner, took my Hand, and pre&s;ented the Four Gentlemen to me, each by his Name. Sir <HI>Charles</HI> &s;aid, pretty bluntly, That he hoped he was
<PB N="381" REF="386">
more welcome to me now, than the la&s;t time he was under the &s;ame Roof with me; for he had been told &s;ince, that <HI>that</HI> was our happy Day.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Friends were always welcome to me.</P>
<P>'Tis well, Madam, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Sedley,</HI> we did not know how it was. We &s;hould have quarter'd our|&s;elves upon Mr. <HI>B.</HI> for a Week together, and kept him up Day and Night.</P>
<P>I thought this Speech de&s;erved no An&s;wer, e&s;pe|cially as they were Gentlemen who wanted no Coun|tenance, and addre&s;s'd my&s;elf to Lord <HI>Davers,</HI> who is always kindly making Court to me: I hope, my good Lord, &s;aid I, you find your&s;elf quite recover'd of your Head-ach? &mdash; (of which he complained at Breakfa&s;t).</P>
<P>I thank you, my dear Si&s;ter, pretty well.</P>
<P>I was telling Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> and the other Gentle|men, Niece, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> how I was cheated here, when I came fir&s;t, with a Lady <HI>Jenny.</HI></P>
<P>It was a very lucky Cheat for me, Sir <HI>Jacob</HI>; for it gave you a Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my Favour, under &s;o advantageous a Character, that I could never have expected otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, my Daughter, for whom Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> took you, had Mrs. <HI>B.</HI>'s Qualities to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>How am I obliged to your Lady&s;hip's Goodne&s;s, return'd I, when you treat me with even greater In|dulgence than you u&s;e to &s;o beloved a Daughter!</P>
<P>Nay, now you talk of treating, &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> when, Ladies, will you treat our Sex with the Po|litene&s;s which you &s;hew to one another?</P>
<P>When your Sex de&s;erve it, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid Lady <HI>Davers.</HI></P>
<P>Who is to be Judge of that? &s;aid Mr. <HI>Walgrave.</HI></P>
<P>Not the Gentlemen, I hope, reply'd my Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="387">Well then, Mrs. <HI>B.</HI> &s;aid Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> we be&s;peak your good Opinion of <HI>us</HI>; for you have <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>I am obliged to you, Gentlemen; but I mu&s;t be more cautious in declaring <HI>mine,</HI> le&s;t it &s;hould be thought I am influenc'd by your kind, and perhaps too ha&s;ty Opinions of me.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles</HI> &s;wore they had <HI>&s;een</HI> enough of me the Moment I entered the Parlour, and <HI>heard</HI> enough the Moment I opened my Lips, to an&s;wer for <HI>their</HI> Opinions of me.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I made no doubt, when <HI>they</HI> had as good a Subject to expatiate upon, as I had, in the Plea&s;ure before me, of &s;eeing &s;o many agreeable Friends of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s, they would maintain the Title they claim'd to every one's good Opinion.</P>
<P>This, &s;aid Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> is binding you over, Gentle|men, to your good Behaviour. &mdash; You mu&s;t know, my Niece never &s;hoots flying, as <HI>you</HI> do.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen laugh'd: Is it &s;hooting flying, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> return'd Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> to prai&s;e that Lady?</P>
<P>Adsbud, I did not think of that.</P>
<P>O Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;aid the Counte&s;s, you need not be at a Fault; &mdash; for a good Sport&s;man always hits his Mark, flying or not: And the Gentlemen had &s;o fair an one, that they could not well mi&s;s it.</P>
<P>You are fairly help'd over the Stile, Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;aid Mr. <HI>Floyd.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed I wanted it; tho' I limp'd like a Pup|py, before I was lame. One can't think of every thing, as one us'd to do at your Time of Life, Gentlemen.</P>
<P>This flippant Stuff was all that pa&s;s'd, which I <HI>can</HI> recite; for the re&s;t, at Table, and after Dinner, was too polite by half for me: Such as, The Quantity of Wine each Man could <HI>carry off,</HI> that was the Phra&s;e; Dogs, Hor&s;es, Hunting, Racing, Cock-fighting, and all accompanied with Swearing, and
<PB N="383" REF="388">
Cur&s;ing, and that in good Humour, and out of Wan|tonne&s;s (the lea&s;t excu&s;able and mo&s;t profligate Sort of Swearing and Cur&s;ing of all); loud Laughing, with a little touching now-and-then on the Borders of Sir <HI>Simon</HI>'s beloved Subject, to try if they could make a Lady &s;hew &s;he <HI>under&s;tood</HI> their Hints by her <HI>Blu&s;hes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. <HI>p.</HI> 111.</NOTE>; a certain Indication, that tho&s;e who &s;eek a Blu&s;h in others, are pa&s;t it them&s;elves, and, by their turning it into Ridicule when they find it in their Friends, that they would not for the World have it imputed to them; talking three or four at once, and as loud as if they were in the Field pur&s;uing their Game, at a Quarter of a Mile's Di&s;tance from one another.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Subjects, and this the Entertain|ment, that held my Ladies and me for one Hour after a tedious Dinner; when we retir'd, and glad we were to do &s;o: And &s;o well did the Gentlemen like the Wine, that we had the Felicity to drink Tea and Coffee by our&s;elves; only Mr. <HI>B.</HI> (upon our inviting the Gentlemen to partake with us) &s;liding in for a few Minutes, to tell us, they would &s;tick by what they had, and taking a Di&s;h of Coffee with us.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not omit one Ob&s;ervation; That Sir <HI>Jacob,</HI> when they were gone, &s;aid, They were <HI>pure Company:</HI> And Mr. <HI>H.</HI> That he never was &s;o de|lighted in his <HI>born Days.</HI> &mdash; While the two Ladies put up their Prayers, that they might never have &s;uch another Entertainment. And being encouraged by their Declaration, I pre&s;umed to join in the &s;ame Petition.</P>
<P>Yet, it &s;eems, the&s;e are Men of Wit! I believe they mu&s;t be &s;o &mdash; becau&s;e I could neither like nor under&s;tand them. &mdash; Yet, if their Conver&s;ation had much Wit in it, I &s;hould think my Ladies would have found it out.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="389">However, this they did find out, and agree in that the&s;e Gentlemen were of the true modern Ca&s;t of Libertines and Foxhunters, and, indifferently as they liked them, could not be ea&s;ily out-done by any of the &s;ame Stamp in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>God defend my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> and every worthy &s;ingle Lady, from &s;uch an Husband, as a Gentleman of this Character would make!</P>
<P>I wonder really, how Mr. <HI>B.</HI> who chu&s;es not this &s;ort of Conver&s;ation, and always (whatever Faults he had be&s;ides) was a <HI>&s;ober</HI> Gentleman, can &s;it for Hours &s;o ea&s;y and chearful in it; and yet he never &s;ays much, when they are in their high Delight.</P>
<P>When all's done, Mi&s;s, there are very unplea&s;ant Things, which Per&s;ons in <HI>genteel</HI> Life are forced to put up with, as well as tho&s;e in <HI>lower</HI>; and were the one to be balanced again&s;t the other, the Differ|ence, as to true Happine&s;s, would not perhaps be &s;o great, as People in the latter imagine, &mdash; if it did not turn in their Favour. Well &s;ays the above quoted Manu&s;cript,</P>
<Q><L>We the Di&s;comforts know of what we are,</L>
<L>But little think what States &s;uperior &s;hare.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The Gentlemen, permit me to add, went away very merry to ride ten Miles by Owl-light; for they would not accept of Beds here. They had two <HI>French</HI> Horns with them, and gave us a Bla&s;t, or Flouri&s;h or two, at going off. Each had a Servant be&s;ides: But the Way they were in, would have given me more Concern than it did, had they been related to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and le&s;s u&s;ed to it. And indeed it is a Happine&s;s, that &s;uch Gentlemen take no more Care, than they generally do, to intere&s;t any body, inti|mately, in their Healths and Pre&s;ervation; for the&s;e are all &s;ingle Men. Nor is the Publick, any more than the Private, under any Nece&s;&s;ity to be much
<PB N="385" REF="390">
concern'd about them; for let &s;uch Per&s;ons go when they will, if they continue &s;ingle, their next Heir cannot well be a wor&s;e Commonwealth's-man; and there is a great Chance he may be a better.</P>
<P>You know I end my <HI>Saturdays</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly. And this, to what I have already &s;aid, makes me add, that I cannot expre&s;s how much I am, my dear Mi&s;s,</P>

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>COULD you ever have thought, Mi&s;s, that Hu&s;|bands have a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power over their Wives, which Kings are not allowed over the Laws? I have this Day had a &s;mart Debate with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and I fear it will not be the only one upon this Subject. Can you believe, that if a Wife thinks
<PB N="390" REF="395">
a Thing her Duty to do, and her Husband does not approve of her doing it, he can di&s;pen&s;e with her performing it, and no Sin &s;hall lie at her Door? Mr. <HI>B.</HI> maintains this Point. I have great Doubts about it; particularly one; that if a Matter be my Duty, and he di&s;pen&s;es with my Performance of it, whether, even altho' that were to clear <HI>me</HI> of the Sin, it will not fall upon <HI>him&s;elf?</HI> And to be &s;ure, Mi&s;s, a good Wife would be as much concern'd at this, as if it was to remain upon <HI>her.</HI> Yet he &s;eems &s;et upon it. What can one do?&mdash;Did you ever hear of &s;uch a Notion before, Mi&s;s? Of &s;uch a Prerogative in a Husband? Would you care to &s;ub|&s;cribe to it? This is one of Mr. <HI>B.</HI>'s Particularities. He has &s;everal of them, the Effects, as I take it, of his former too free Life. Polygamy, as I have mentioned heretofore, is another. That is a bad one indeed. Yet he is not &s;o determin'd on this, as he &s;eems to be on the other, in a certain Ca&s;e, that is too <HI>nice</HI> for me, at pre&s;ent, to explain to you; and &s;o I might as well have taken no No|tice of it, as yet&mdash;Only the Argument was &s;o pre|&s;ent to my Mind: Held within this Hour, and I write a Journal, you know, of what pa&s;&s;es.

<HEAD>THURSDAY.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lady urging me to procure her the Ver&s;es you al&s;o de&s;ire about the Love Quarrel, I this Day prevailed upon Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to favour me with a Sight of them; and he was &s;o kind as to give us the following Hi&s;tory of the Parties and the Quar|rel.</P>
<P>A fine Gentleman, his Friend, ble&s;t with an am|ple Fortune, and extraordinary Qualities, but not free from Faults as great as his Perfections, princi|pally with regard to Ladies, was approved of by the Parents of a Lady beautiful as a <HI>May</HI> Morning, tender and meek as a Lamb,&mdash;and prudent and witty; but &s;o diffident, that &s;he had hardly a Will of her own; which &s;ubjected her to Inconveniencies.</P>
<P>The Gentleman made a Campaign, as a Volun|tier, having a Fondne&s;s for the Miliary Life, and no Inclination to marry; but being &s;lightly wounded, and coming over to be cured, and the Match be|ing propo&s;ed, their Fortunes very great on both Sides, he &s;o well approved the Propo&s;al, and the Lady fell &s;o much in Love with him, that it was in a manner concluded upon.</P>
<P>The Lady's Uncle Sir <HI>G. K.</HI> a Man of a very wa&s;pi&s;h, po&s;itive, and &s;ordid Temper, to who&s;e large E&s;tate, as well as her Father's, the young Lady was Heire&s;s, oppo&s;es the Match; it is put off to plea&s;e him. The Gentleman makes another Campaign. Her Father dies mean time, leaving Sir <HI>G.</HI> her Guar|dian; but with expre&s;s De&s;ire to &s;ee her marry'd to that Gentleman, and no other. Sir <HI>G.</HI> endeavours to bring about another Match for the Lady, with a Man of Quality, notwith&s;tanding his Brother's De&s;ire; but the Lady, who had fixed her Affections on
<PB N="392" REF="397">
the Gentleman, rejects the Propo&s;al: And her Lover coming over at the End of the Campaign, the Lady con&s;ents to perform her Father's Will; a Will &s;o conformable to her own Inclinations; but would not fix the Day, till he had made up with her Uncle, and got his Con&s;ent; which the old &s;piteful Knight was re&s;olved not to give, and, for a great while, the Gen|tleman not to ask, de&s;pi&s;ing the Knight, and having a Spirit above &s;uppling him&s;elf to an unworthy Mind for &s;ordid Intere&s;t &s;ake.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, however, &s;he prevails: Her Lover, with no good Will, re&s;olves to court Sir <HI>George,</HI> who, to have a Pretence to break the Matter off, treats him with great Indignity, &s;etting his Servants to in&s;ult him. This the young Gentleman re&s;enting, the Knight following him with Outrage to the Top of a Pair of Stairs, he twirled him from Top to Bot|tom almo&s;t; and &s;prain'd the Knight's Foot in the Fall, and went away with Indignation.</P>
<P>This being reported to the Lady, who lived not at that Time with Sir <HI>George,</HI> but at her paternal Seat, and being greatly aggravated to her, &s;he flies to her Uncle, re&s;olves to break with her Lover, and takes up her Re&s;idence with Sir <HI>George</HI> for a while; the old Knight keeping up her Re&s;entment, and prevailing on her to refu&s;e Acce&s;s to the Man to whom &s;he was betrothed, believing, poor Lady! that her Affections were more in her own Power than &s;he afterwards found them, to her Sorrow. For &s;he carry'd the Point &s;o far, renouncing him, thro' fre&s;h Aggravations invented again&s;t him, tho', indeed, he had formerly given him&s;elf too great Li|berties, that he went abroad again, giving her quite for lo&s;t, and enter'd into other Engagements, which made them both unhappy to the End of their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="398">This is the Introduction, as briefly as I can give it; now come the Ver&s;es, in a Letter from the Lover, when abroad, to his Friend, who knew the whole Tran&s;action.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Fain would'&s;t thou, O my Friend, thou &s;ay'&s;t, in Ver&s;e,</L>
<L>Have me my la&s;t &s;hort Interview rehear&s;e</L>
<L>With <HI>my MARIA.</HI> Once I thought her &s;o!</L>
<L>But can a Mind &s;urcharg'd with &s;o much Woe,</L>
<L>Harmoniou&s;ly, in ea&s;y Numbers flow?</L>
<L>But yet, to &s;hew your Pow'r, and my E&s;teem,</L>
<L>Hard tho' it be, your Choice &s;hall fix my Theme.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By various Means, in vain, I'd oft e&s;&s;ay'd</L>
<L>To &s;ee and pacify the angry Maid:</L>
<L>With idle Tales &s;till the malicious Knight</L>
<L>Keeps up her Wrath, and hides her from my Sight.</L>
<L>The more I beg, the humbler I appear,</L>
<L>The haughtier &s;till's the too re&s;enting Fair.</L>
<L>Proud of her Pow'r, &s;he makes me meanly &s;ue,</L>
<L>Nor doubts to bring me to her Uncle's View.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus barr'd Acce&s;s, I by a common Friend</L>
<L>My Innocence endeavour to defend.</L>
<L>Our Friend reports her Temper fix'd. I find</L>
<L>A way by Letter to expre&s;s my Mind.</L>
<L>The haughty Maid &s;till with &s;uch Anger burns,</L>
<L>The Seal unbroke, the &s;uppliant Scroll returns.</L>
<L>What can I do? I hate my&s;elf to find</L>
<L>Such vile unwonted Meanne&s;s in my Mind.</L>
<L>For well thou know'&s;t, till &s;o much Excellence</L>
<L>Engag'd my Soul, I &s;corn'd dull Wedlock's Fence.</L>
<L>And, but I thought, the Charmer met my Flame,</L>
<L>Had never wi&s;h'd to propagate my Name.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><PB N="394" REF="399">Is not this very in&s;olent, Mi&s;s? Did he not de|&s;erve <HI>&s;ome</HI> Puni&s;hment? But it &s;eems, he had a mo&s;t noble Mind, great and good Qualities, tho' intermingled with bad ones; as it is ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who have great Beauties of Mind, have often great Defects; and that Per&s;ons of Parts &s;eldom commit <HI>&s;mall</HI> Faults. You'll find, however, that one Rea&s;on (tho' he puts it not ungenerou&s;ly) for his Pride of Spirit, to the Lady, is, he thinks, &s;he loves him; and that to be &s;ure &s;he did, or el&s;e a Lady of her Virtue would not have been betrothed to him with her own Con&s;ent. Thus he proceeds; making her, however, more oblig'd to his Genero|&s;ity, than Affection, as one would think.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Now fearful, that if I my former View,</L>
<L>The &s;avage military Life, pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>The charming Maid, (my Innocence too late</L>
<L>Appearing) &s;hould lament her new-born Hate,</L>
<L>And her &s;oft Mind, with Love's Extreme annoy'd,</L>

<L>Returning Love &s;hould feel, and &s;he &s;hould grieve</L>

<L>Charge to her&s;elf the Ills that might attend</L>
<L>The vagrant Life of &s;o &s;incere a Friend;</L>
<L>Le&s;t this &s;hould be the Ca&s;e, I write once more,</L>
<L>And, humbly, her returning Love implore&punc;</L>
<L>Prote&s;t my Innocence; beg to be heard,</L>
<L>And claim, but as I make it clear, Regard:</L>
<L>Then fix a Time for th' angry Fair to prove.</L>
<L>The happy Impul&s;e of rekindled Love:</L>
<L>And vow, if after that, &s;he hold her Hate,</L>
<L>To quit my Suit, and &s;eek a kinder Fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This, I re&s;olve, my&s;elf, if Speech deny'd,</L>

<L>Still more and more in&s;ulted by the Knight,</L>

<L>So, fre&s;h Offence t'avoid, I in her Lap,</L>
<L>With Air &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, the fond Letter drop.</L>

<P><PB N="396" REF="401">This the Lady, as you'll hear, throws out of the Coach.

<P>I could not help &s;hewing her Lady&s;hip, who was always inquiring after my Writing Imployment, mo&s;t of what pa&s;s'd between you and me, Mi&s;s; and &s;he admires you much, and wi&s;h'd Mr. <HI>H.</HI> had more Wit, that was her Word: She &s;hould in that Ca&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, be very glad, to &s;et on Foot a Treaty between you and him.</P>
<P>But that, I fan&s;y, can never be tolerable to you, and I only mention it <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant.</HI>&mdash;There's a <HI>French</HI> Woman for you!</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s was full of her kind Wi&s;hes for my Happine&s;s; and my Lady <HI>Davers</HI> told me, That if I could give them timely Notice, &s;he would be pre|&s;ent on a <HI>certain</HI> Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, my dear Mi&s;s, what could I &s;ay? &mdash; I know nothing of the Matter!&mdash;Only, that I am a &s;ad Cow|ard, and have a thou&s;and Anxieties, which I cannot mention to any body.</P>
<P>But, if I have &s;uch in the honourable E&s;tate of Matrimony, what mu&s;t tho&s;e poor Souls have, who have been &s;educed, and have all Manner of Rea&s;on to apprehend, that the Crime &s;hall be followed by a
<PB N="410" REF="415">
Puni&s;hment &s;o <HI>natural</HI> to it? A Puni&s;hment <HI>in kind,</HI> as I may &s;ay; which if it only ends in Forfeiture of Life, following the Forfeiture of Fame, mu&s;t be thought merciful and happy beyond Expectation; for how &s;hall they lay Claim to the Hope that is given to Per&s;ons in their Circum&s;tance, that <HI>they &s;hall be &s;aved in Child-bearing,</HI> &s;ince the Condition is, <HI>if they</HI> CONTINUE <HI>in Faith and Charity, and</HI> HOLINESS <HI>with</HI> SOBRIETY?</P>
<P>Now, my honoured Mother, and my dear Mi&s;s, &s;ince I am upon this affecting Subject, does not this Text &s;eem to give a comfortable Hope to a virtuous Wo|man who &s;hall die in this Circum&s;tance, that &s;he &s;hall be happy in the Divine Mercies? For the Apo&s;tle, in the Context, &s;ays, That he <HI>&s;uffers not a Woman to teach, nor to u&s;urp Authority over the Man, but to be in Silence</HI> &mdash; And what is the Rea&s;on he gives? Why, a Rea&s;on that is a natural Con&s;equence of the Cur&s;e on the fir&s;t Di&s;obedience, that &s;he &s;hall be in Subjection to her Husband. &mdash; For, &s;ays he, <HI>Adam was</HI> NOT <HI>deceived; but the Woman, being deceived, was in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> As much as to &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Had it not been for the Woman, <HI>Adam</HI> had kept his Integrity, and therefore her Puni&s;hment &s;hall be, as it is &s;aid, <HI>I will greatly multiply thy Sorrow in thy Conception: In Sorrow &s;halt thou bring forth Children, &mdash; and thy Husband &s;hall rule over thee.</HI> But neverthele&s;s, if thou &s;halt not &s;urvive the Sharpne&s;s of thy Sorrow, thy Death &s;hall be deemed to be &s;uch an Alleviation of thy Part of the intailed Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that thou &s;halt <HI>be &s;aved,</HI> if thou ha&s;t CONTINUED in Faith, and Charity, and HOLINESS with SOBRIETY."</Q></P>
<P>This, my honoured Parents, and my dear Friend, is <HI>my</HI> Paraphra&s;e; and I reap no &s;mall Comfort from it, when I meditate upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="416">But I &s;hall make you as &s;erious as my&s;elf; and, my dear Mi&s;s, perhaps, frighten you from entering into a State, in which our poor Sex &s;uffer &s;o much, from the Bridal Morning, let it ri&s;e as gayly as it will upon a thoughtful Mind, to that affecting Circum&s;tance, (throughout its whole Progre&s;&s;ion) for which no|thing but a tender, a generous, and a worthy Husband can make them any Part of Amends. &mdash; And when one <HI>is</HI> &s;o ble&s;s'd, one has &s;o many Fears added to one's Sorrows; and &s;o much Apprehen&s;ion, thro' human Frailty, of being &s;eparated from &s;o beloved a Partner, that a body had need of all one's Fortitude to &s;upport one's &s;elf. But may-be I am the weake&s;t and mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive of my Sex &mdash; May-be I am! &mdash; And when one &s;ees how common the Ca&s;e is, and yet how few die in it; how unea&s;y many Ladies are <HI>not</HI> to be in this Circum&s;tance, (my good Lady <HI>Davers</HI> particularly, at times) and <HI>Rachel</HI> and <HI>Hannah</HI> in Holy Writ; and then how a childle&s;s E&s;tate might le&s;&s;en one in the E&s;teem of one's Husband, one ought to bring the&s;e Con&s;iderations in Balance, and to bani&s;h needle&s;s Fears. And &s;o I will, if I can.</P>
<P>But a Word or two more, as to the parting with our honoured Gue&s;ts. I was a little indi&s;pos'd, and my Ladies would excu&s;e me, again&s;t my Will, from attending them in the Coach &s;ome Miles, which their dear Brother did. Both Ladies mo&s;t tenderly &s;aluted me, twice and thrice apiece, folding their kind Arms about me, and wi&s;hing my Safety and Health, and charging me to <HI>think</HI> little, and <HI>hope</HI> much; for they &s;aw me thoughtful at times, tho' I endeavoured to hide it from them.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Davers</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, with a Good|ne&s;s of Temper that is his Peculiar, My deare&s;t, dear Si&s;ter, &mdash; May God pre&s;erve you! &mdash; and multiply your Comforts! I &s;hall pray for you more than ever I did for my&s;elf, tho' I have &s;o much more need

of it!&mdash;I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> leave you&mdash;But I leave a Lady that I love and honour next to Lady <HI>Davers,</HI> and ever &s;hall.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>H.</HI> looked con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;illy.&mdash;I can &s;ay nothing, Madam &mdash; but (&s;aluting me) that I &s;hall never forget your Goodne&s;s to me.&mdash;Adding, in his frothy Way, Now can I &s;ay, I have &s;aluted an Angel, if ever there was an Angel on Earth.</P>
<P>I had before, in Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Parlour, taken Leave of Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> my Lady's Women: They each, &s;tole, as it were, at the &s;ame time, a Hand of mine, and ki&s;&s;ed it, begging Par|don, as they &s;aid, for the Freedom. But I an&s;wer'd, taking each by her Hand, and ki&s;&s;ing her, I &s;hall al|ways think of you with Plea&s;ure, my good Friends, for you have encouraged me con&s;tantly by your Pre|&s;ence in my private Duties. And may God ble&s;s you, and the worthy Families you &s;o laudably &s;erve, as well for your &s;akes, as their own!</P>
<P>They turned away with Tears, and Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> would have &s;aid &s;omething to me, but could not.&mdash; Only both taking Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> by her Hand, Happy, happy, Mrs. <HI>Jervis!</HI> &s;aid they, almo&s;t in a Breath. &mdash;And happy, happy I, too, repeated I, in my Mrs. <HI>Jervis,</HI> and in &s;uch kind and worthy Well-wi&s;hers as Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley.</HI> Wear this, Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI>; wear this, Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> for my &s;ake; &mdash;And I gave each of them a Ring, with a Cry|&s;tal and Brilliants &s;et about it, which my deare&s;t Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had bought a Week before for this very Purpo&s;e; for he has a great Opinion of both the good Folks, and often prai&s;ed their Prudence, and their quiet and re&s;pectful Behaviour to every body, &s;o different from the Impertinence, that was his Word, of mo&s;t Ladies Women, who are Favourites.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI> &s;aid, I have enjoyed many happy Hours in your Conver&s;ation, Mrs. <HI>Worden</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Le&s;ley:</HI> I &s;hall mi&s;s you very much.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="418">I mu&s;t endeavour, &s;aid I, taking her Hand, to make it up to you, my good Friend, as well as I can. And of late we have not had &s;o many Op|portunities together as I &s;hould have wi&s;hed, had I not been &s;o agreeably engaged as you know.&mdash; So we mu&s;t each try to comfort the other, when we have lo&s;t, I &s;uch noble, and you &s;uch worthy Gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s hone&s;t Heart, before touched by the Parting, &s;hew'd it&s;elf at her Eyes&mdash;Wonder not, my good Friends, &s;aid I, to the two Gentle|women, wiping with my Handkerchief her venera|ble Cheeks, that I always endeavour thus to dry up all my good Mrs. <HI>Jervis</HI>'s Tears; and then I ki&s;&s;ed her, thinking of you, my dear Mother; and I was forced to withdraw a little abruptly, le&s;t I &s;hould be too much moved my&s;elf, becau&s;e I was going up to our noble Gue&s;ts, who, had they inquired into the Occa&s;ion, would perhaps have thought it derogatory (tho' I &s;hould not) to my pre&s;ent Station, and too much retro&s;pecting to my former.</P>
<P>I could not, in Conver&s;ation between Mr. <HI>B.</HI> and my&s;elf, when I was gratefully expatiating upon the amiable Characters of our noble Gue&s;ts, and of their Behaviour and Kindne&s;s to me, help ob&s;erv|ing, that I had little expected, from &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vol. II. p. 154.</NOTE> Hints which formerly dropt from Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to find my good Lord <HI>Davers</HI> &s;o polite and &s;o &s;en&s;ible a Nobleman.</P>
<P>He is a very good-natur'd Man, reply'd Mr. <HI>B.</HI> I believe I might once or twice drop &s;ome di&s;re|&s;pectful Words of him. But it was the Effect of Pa&s;&s;ion, at the Time, and with a View to two or three Points of his Conduct in publick Life; for which I took the Liberty to find fault with him, and received very un&s;atisfactory Excu&s;es. One of
<PB N="414" REF="419">
the&s;e, I remember particularly, was in a Conference between a Committee of each Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment, in which he behaved in a way I could not wi&s;h from a Gentleman &s;o nearly ally'd to me by Marriage; for all he could talk of, was the Dig|nity of their Hou&s;e, when the Rea&s;on of the Thing was &s;trong with the other; and it fell to my Lot to an&s;wer what he &s;aid; which I did with &s;ome A&s;perity, which occa&s;ioned a Coolne&s;s between us for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>But no Man makes a better Figure in private Life than Lord <HI>Davers;</HI> e&s;pecially now, that my Si&s;ter's good Sen&s;e has got the better of her Pa&s;|&s;ions, and &s;he can behave with tolerable Decency towards him. For, formerly, <HI>Pamela,</HI> it was not &s;o; the Violence of her Spirit making him appear in a Light too little advantageous either to his Quality or Merit. But now his Lord&s;hip improves upon me every time I &s;ee him.</P>
<P>You know not, my Dear, continued Mr. <HI>B.</HI> what a Di&s;grace a haughty and pa&s;&s;ionate Woman brings upon her Husband, and upon her&s;elf too, in the Eye of her own Sex, as well as ours. Nay, even tho&s;e Ladies, who would be as glad of Do|minion as &s;he, if they might be permitted to exer|ci&s;e it, de&s;pi&s;e others who do, and the Man <HI>mo&s;t,</HI> who &s;uffers it.</P>
<P>And let me tell you, my <HI>Pamela,</HI> &s;aid the dear Gentleman, with an Air that &s;hew'd he was &s;ati&s;|fy'd with his own Conduct in this Particular, that you cannot imagine how much a Lady owes to her Husband, as well with regard to <HI>her own</HI> Peace of Mind, as to <HI>both</HI> their Reputations, (however it may go again&s;t the Grain with her &s;ometimes) if he be a Man, who has Di&s;cretion to keep her incroaching Pa&s;&s;ions under a genteel and rea&s;onable Controul!</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="420">How do you like this Doctrine, Mi&s;s?&mdash;I'll war|rant you believe, that I could do no le&s;s, than drop Mr. <HI>B.</HI> one of my be&s;t Court'&s;ies, in Acknowlege|ment of my Obligation to him, for &s;o con&s;iderately pre&s;erving to me <HI>my</HI> Peace of Mind, and <HI>my</HI> Re|putation, as well as <HI>his own,</HI> in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But after all, when one duly weighs the Matter, I can't tell but what he &s;ays may be right in the main; for I have not been able to contradict him, partial as I am to my Sex, when he has pointed out to me In&s;tances in the Behaviour of certain Ladies, who, like Children, the more they have been hu|mour'd, the more humour&s;ome they have grown; which mu&s;t have occa&s;ion'd as great Unea&s;ine&s;s to them&s;elves, as to their Husbands. Will you ex|cu&s;e me, Mi&s;s? &mdash; This is between our&s;elves; for I did not own as much to Mr. <HI>B.</HI>&mdash;For one &s;hould not give up one's Sex you know, if one can help it; for the Men will be as apt to impo&s;e, as the La|dies to incroach, I doubt.</P>

<P>If any thing new or uncommon, or more par|ticularly affecting to me than u&s;ual, occurs, I &s;hall not fail to trouble you with it, as I have Oppor|tunity.

<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My dear Mi&s;s</HI> DARNFORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Hear that Mrs. <HI>Jewkes</HI> is in no good State of Health. I am very &s;orry for it. I pray for her Life, that &s;he may be a Credit (if it plea&s;e God) to the Penitence &s;he has &s;o lately a&s;&s;umed.&mdash; For if &s;he die, it will look di&s;couraging to &s;ome thoughtle&s;s Minds, who penetrate not the Methods Providence takes with its poor Creatures, that as &s;oon as &s;he had changed her Manner of Living, and was in a reformed State, &s;he was taken away: Tho' 'tis certain, that a Per&s;on is fitte&s;t to die, when worthie&s;t to live. And what a Mercy will it be to her, if &s;he &s;hould <HI>not</HI> live long, that &s;he &s;aw her Errors, and repented before 'twas too late?</P>
<P>Do, my dear <HI>good Mi&s;s,</HI> vouch&s;afe to the poor Soul the Honour of a Vi&s;it: She may be low-&s;pirited&mdash;She may be too much &s;unk with the Re|collection of pa&s;t Things&mdash;Comfort, with that Sweetne&s;s which is &s;o natural to Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> her drooping Heart, and let her know, that I have a true Concern for her, and give it her in Charge
<PB N="417" REF="422">
to take care of her&s;elf, and &s;pare nothing that will admini&s;ter either to her Health or Peace of Mind.</P>
<P>You'll pardon me, my dear Mi&s;s, that I put you upon &s;uch an Office; an Office indeed un&s;uitable from a Lady in your Station, to one in hers; but not to your Piety and Charity, where a Duty &s;o emi|nent as that of vi&s;iting the Sick, and chearing the doubting Mind, is in the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I know your Conde&s;cen&s;ion will give her great Comfort, and if &s;he &s;hould be ha&s;tening to her Account, what a Plea&s;ure will it give &s;uch a Lady as you, to have illuminated a benighted Mind, when it was tottering on the Verge of Life!</P>
<P>But I hope &s;he will get the better of her Indi&s;po|&s;ition, and live many Years a thankful Monument of God's Mercies, and to do more Good by her Example in the latter Part of her Life, than &s;he may po&s;&s;ibly have done Evil in the former.</P>
<P>I know &s;he will want no &s;piritual Help from good Mr. <HI>Peters</HI>; but then the kind Notice of &s;o gene|rally e&s;teem'd a young Lady, will rai&s;e her more than can be imagined; for there is a Tenderne&s;s, a Sympathy, in the good Per&s;ons of our Sex to one another, that (while the be&s;t of the other &s;eem but to act as in Office, &s;aying to one tho&s;e Things, which, tho' edifying and convincing, one is not cer|tain proceeds not rather from the Fortitude of their Minds, than the Tenderne&s;s of their Natures) min|gles from Sex to Sex with one's very Spirits, thins the animal Ma&s;s, and runs thro' one's Heart, in the &s;ame lify Current (I can't cloathe my Thought &s;uitably to expre&s;s what I <HI>would</HI> expre&s;s) giving A&s;&s;urance as well as Plea&s;ure in the mo&s;t arduous Ca&s;es, and brightening our mi&s;ty Pro&s;pects, till we &s;ee the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ri&s;ing on the Hills of Comfort, and di&s;pelling the heavy Fogs of Doubt and Diffidence&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="423">This it is makes me wi&s;h and long as I do, for the Company of my dear Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford.</HI> O when &s;hall I &s;ee you?

<P>But I ought not to &s;et my Heart upon any thing that is not in my own Power, and which may be &s;ubject to Accidents, and the Controul of others. But, let whatever Interventions happen, &s;o I have your <HI>Will</HI> to come, I mu&s;t be rejoiced in your kind Intention, altho' your <HI>Power</HI> &s;hould not prove an&s;werable.</P>
<P>And now, my deare&s;t honoured Mother, let me tell you, that I build no &s;mall Con&s;olation in the Hope, that I &s;hall, on a certain Occa&s;ion, have your Pre&s;ence, and be &s;trengthened by your Advice and Comfortings. For this was a Propo&s;al of the be&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderate of Gentlemen, who is every Day, if he but &s;ees the lea&s;t Thoughtfulne&s;s upon my Brow, &s;tudying to &s;ay or to do &s;omething to di&s;pel it. But I believe it is the grateful Sen&s;e I have of his Goodne&s;s to me, that makes me thus over-an|xious: For the Apprehen&s;ions of a Separation from &s;uch an excellent Husband, from Hopes &s;o chear|ing, Pro&s;pects &s;o delightful, mu&s;t at times affect one, let one's Affiance and De&s;ires be ever &s;o &s;trong where they ought to be preferably placed.&mdash;Then one <HI>would</HI> live to do a little more Good, if one <HI>might!</HI></P>
<P>I am a &s;ad weak, apprehen&s;ive Body; to be &s;ure I am! How much better fitted for the Contingen|cies of Life, are the gay, frolick Minds, that think not of any thing before it comes upon them, than &s;uch thoughtful Futurity-Pokers as me!</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="424">But why &s;hould I trouble you, my honoured and dear Friends, with my idle Fears and Follies&mdash;ju&s;t as if nobody was ever in my Circum&s;tance be|fore? &mdash;Yet weak and apprehen&s;ive Spirits will be gloomily-affected &s;ometimes; and how can one help it?&mdash;And if I may not hope for the indulgent Soothings of the be&s;t of Parents, and of my Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford,</HI> in who&s;e Bo&s;om be&s;ides can one disbur|den one's Heart, when oppre&s;&s;ed by too great a Weight of Thought?</P>
<P>You <HI>will</HI> come, and be in the Hou&s;e with me, my dear Mother, for &s;ome Time, when my be&s;t Friend &s;ends to you:&mdash;Won't you?&mdash;And you will <HI>&s;pare</HI> my dear Mother, my be&s;t of Fathers: Won't you? &mdash;Yes, yes, I am &s;ure ye will &mdash;And I am &s;ure my Mi&s;s <HI>Darnford</HI> will be with me, if &s;he can; and the&s;e are my Comforts.
