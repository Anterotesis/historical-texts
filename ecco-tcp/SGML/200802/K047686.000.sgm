<P>TO tho&s;e who are not conver&s;ant in the hi&s;tory of the A&s;iatic nations, it may not be improper to give in brief, the &s;tory upon which the Tragedy of Zingis is founded, as it is taken from the TARICH MOGULISTAN, or Hi&s;tory of the Mogul Tartars, written in the Per|&s;ian language.</P>
<P>In the twelfth century, mo&s;t of the Tartar Ordas, or tribes, though governed by their own chiefs, paid tribute to the king of the Orda of the Keraits, who held his court under the title of the GRAND CHAN, in the city of Caracorum, well known &s;ince by the name of Orda|balich. The famous Zingis Chan, who afterwards con|quered all the countries from the &s;ea of Canton in China to the Nile, was prince of the Niron tribe of Tartars; and from his early youth, &s;erved in the armies of Aunac, the Grand Chan; and at la&s;t ro&s;e to the command of all his forces. Zemouca, chief of the Siogarates, &s;upplanted Zingis in Aunac's favor. Zingis was di&s;graced. He retired to his Orda, which was in &s;ome mea&s;ure indepen|dent of the Grand Chan. Aunac pur&s;ued Zingis with a &s;mall force, and was defeated. In the en&s;uing year Aunac was, in a pitched battle, totally routed by Zingis; Zangon the prince royal was &s;lain, and the only daughter of Aunac, Ovi&s;a Lug&icirc;n, fell into the conqueror's hands. Zingis having determined to give Ovi&s;a in marriage to his favorite &s;on Octar, who afterwards &s;ucceeded him in the empire of all A&s;ia, occa&s;ioned an in&s;urrection under Timur, another of his &s;ons, who was in love with the prince&s;s. Timur fell in his rebellion, Ovi&s;a died of grief, and the unfortunate monarch, Aunac, was killed in his flight, from an action, in which he was defeated by a part of the army of Zingis.</P>
<P>Zingis Chan, whether we regard him as a conqueror or legi&s;lator, was, perhaps, the greate&s;t prince, that ever appeared in hi&s;tory. He not only &s;ecured the em|pire of all A&s;ia to his po&s;terity for &s;ome ages, but even to
<PB REF="4">
this day, two-thirds of that immen&s;e continent remains in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of princes of his blood. So fortunate was he in his children and de&s;cendents, that many of them did not yield in abilities to him; and they would, per|haps, have equalled him in fame, had his &s;word left them more to conquer.&mdash;The Emperor of China, the Mogul of India, the great Chan of Tartary, and the princes of the Krim Tartars, derive their blood from Zingis; and it is remarkable that, at one period, there were five hundred crowned heads of his race in A&s;ia.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. GARRICK,</BYLINE>
<STAGE>Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.</STAGE>
<L>I'M &s;ent, good folks, to &s;peak the Epilogue,</L>
<L>But 'tis &s;o dull&mdash;I'll cheat the &s;cribling rogue;</L>
<L>Among our&s;elves, your lo&s;s will be but &s;mall,&mdash;</L>
<L>YOU'RE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>to the Boxes.</HI></NOTE> too polite for Epilogue to call;</L>
<L>But as for YOU<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg"><HI>to the Gallery.</HI></NOTE>,&mdash;it is your joy and pride,</L>
<L>Ever to call&mdash;but never &s;atisfied.&mdash;</L>
<L>Will you, ye Criticks, give up Rome and Greece?</L>
<L>And turn Mahometans, and &s;ave this Piece?</L>
<L>What, &s;hall our &s;tage receive this Tartar race,</L>
<L>Each whi&s;ker'd hero with a copper face?</L>
<L>I hate the Tartars,&mdash;hate their vile religion,&mdash;</L>
<L>We have no &s;ouls for&s;ooth&mdash;that's their deci&s;ion!</L>
<L>The&s;e brutes, &s;ome horrid prejudice controuls;</L>
<L>Speak, Engli&s;h hu&s;bands&mdash;have your wives no &s;ouls?</L>
<L>Then for our per&s;ons&mdash;&s;till more &s;hameful work,</L>
<L>A hundred women wed a &s;ingle Turk!</L>
<L>Again, ye Engli&s;h hu&s;bands, what &s;ay you?</L>
<L>A hundred wives! you wou'd not wi&s;h for <HI>Two.</HI></L>
<L>Romans and Greeks for me!&mdash;O that dear Sparta!</L>
<L>Their women had a noble Magna Charta!</L>
<L>There a young hero, had he won fair fame,</L>
<L>Might from her hu&s;band, a&s;k a lovely dame;</L>
<L>The happy hu&s;band of the honour vain,</L>
<L>Gave her with joy, took her with joy again;</L>
<L>The cho&s;en dame, no &s;truggles had within,</L>
<L>For to refu&s;e had been a public &s;in.&mdash;</L>
<L><PB REF="94">
And to their honour, all hi&s;torians &s;ay,</L>
<L>No Spartan lady, ever &s;inn'd that way.&mdash;</L>
<L>Ye Fair, who have not yet thrown out your bait,</L>
<L>To tangle captives in the marriage &s;tate;</L>
<L>Take heed, I warn you, where your &s;nares you &s;et,</L>
<L>O let not Infidels, come near your net.</L>
<L>Let hand in hand with prudence go your wi&s;hes,</L>
<L>Men are in general, the &s;trange&s;t fi&s;hes!</L>
<L>Do not for mi&s;ery your beauty barter,</L>
<L>And, O take heed,&mdash;you do not catch a Tartar.</L>
