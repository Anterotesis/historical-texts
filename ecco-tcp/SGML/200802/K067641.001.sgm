THE LIVES OF THE POETS.</HEAD>

<P>_IT has been ob&s;erved that men of emi|nence in all ages, and di&s;tingui&s;hed for the &s;ame excellence, have gene|rally had &s;omething in their lives &s;i|milar to each other. The place of Homer's nativity, has not been more variou&s;ly conjectured, or his parents more differently a&s;&s;igned than our author's. Leland, who lived neare&s;t to Chaucer's time of all tho&s;e who have wrote his life, was commi&s;&s;ioned by king Henry VIII, to &s;earch all the libraries, and re|ligious hou&s;es in England, when tho&s;e archives were pre&s;erved, before their de&s;truction was produced by the reformation, or Polydore Virgil had con&s;umed &s;uch curious pieces as would have contradicted his framed and fabulous hi&s;tory. He for &s;ome rea&s;ons
<PB N="2" REF="7">
believed Oxford or Berk&s;hire to have given birth to this great man, but has not informed us what tho&s;e rea&s;ons were that induced him to believe &s;o, and at pre&s;ent there appears no other, but that the &s;eats of his family were in tho&s;e countries. Pitts po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, without producing any authority to &s;upport it, that Wood&s;tock was the place; which opinion Mr. Camden &s;eems to hint at, where he mentions that town; but it may be &s;u&s;pected that Pitts had no other ground for the a&s;&s;ertion, than Chaucer's mentioning Wood&s;tock park in his works, and having a hou&s;e there. But after all the&s;e different preten|&s;ions, he him&s;elf, in the Te&s;tament of Love, &s;eems to point out the place of his nativity to be the city of London, and tho' Mr. Camden mentions the claim of Wood&s;tock, he does not give much credit to it; for &s;peaking of Spencer (who was uncontrovertedly born in London) he calls him fellow citizen to Chaucer.</P>
<P>The de&s;cent of Chaucer is as uncertain, and unfixed by the critics, as the place of his birth. Mr. Speight is of opinion, that one Richard Chaucer was his father, and that one Elizabeth Chaucer, a nun of St. Helen's, in the &s;econd year of Richard II. might have been his &s;i&s;ter, or of his kindred. But this conjecture, &s;ays Urry,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Chaucer prefixed to Ogle's edition of that author modernized.</NOTE> &s;eems very improbable; for this Richard was a vintner, living at the corner of Kirton-lane, and at his death left his hou&s;e, ta|vern, and &s;tock to the church of St. Mary Alder|mary, which in all probability he would not have done if he had had any &s;ons to po&s;&s;e&s;s his fortune; nor is it very likely he could enjoy the family e&s;tates mentioned by Leland in Oxford&s;hire, and at the &s;ame time follow &s;uch an occupation. Pitts a&s;|&s;erts, that his father was a knight; but tho' there is no authority to &s;upport this a&s;&s;ertion, yet it is rea|&s;onable
<PB N="3" REF="8">
to &s;uppo&s;e that he was &s;omething &s;uperior to a common employ. We find one John Chaucer attending upon Edward III. and Queen Philippa, in their expedition to Flanders and Cologn, who had the King's protection to go over &s;ea in the twelfth year of his reign. It is highly probable that this gentleman was father to our Geoffry, and the &s;up|po&s;ition is &s;trengthened by Chaucer's fir&s;t applica|tion, after leaving the univer&s;ity and inns of law, be|ing to the Court; nor is it unlikely that the &s;ervice of the father &s;hould recommend the &s;on.</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally agreed, that he was born in the &s;econd year of the reign of King Edward III. A. D. 1328. His fir&s;t &s;tudies were in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and when about eighteen years of age he wrote his Court of Love, but of what college he was is uncertain, there being no account of him in the records of the Univer&s;ity. From Cambridge he was removed to Oxford in order to compleat his &s;tudies, and after a con&s;iderable &s;tay there, and a &s;trict application to the public lectures of the univer|&s;ity, he became (&s;ays Leland) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a ready logician, a &s;mooth rhetorician, a plea&s;ant poet, a great phi|lo&s;opher, an ingenious mathematician, and a holy divine. That he was a great ma&s;ter in a&s;tronomy, is plain by his di&s;cour&s;es of the A&s;trolabe. That he was ver&s;ed in hermetic philo&s;ophy (which pre|vailed much at that time,) appears by his Tale of the Chanons Yeoman: His knowledge in divi|nity is evident from his Par&s;on's Tale, and his philo&s;ophy from the Te&s;tament of Love."</Q> Thus qualified to make a figure in the world, he left his learned retirement, and travelled into France, Hol|land, and other countries, where he &s;pent &s;ome of his younger days. Upon his return he entered him|&s;elf in the Inner Temple, where he &s;tudied the mu|nicipal laws of the land. But he had not long pro|&s;ecuted that dry &s;tudy, till his &s;uperior abilities were taken notice of by &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, by
<PB N="4" REF="9">
who&s;e patronage he then approached the &s;plendor of the court. The reign of Edward III. was glo|rious and &s;ucce&s;sful, he was a di&s;cerning as well as a fortunate Monarch; he had a ta&s;te as well for eru|dition as for arms; he was an encourager of men of wit and parts, and permitted them to approach him, without re&s;erve. At Edward's court nothing but gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ry and a round of plea&s;ure prevailed, and how well qualifed ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> poet was to &s;hine in the &s;oft circles, whoever has read his works, will be at no lo&s;s to de|termine; but be&s;ides the advantages of his wit and learning, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of per&s;on in a very con|&s;iderable degree. He was then about the age of thirty, of a fair beautiful complexion, his lips red and full, his &s;ize of a ju&s;t medium, and his air poli&s;hed and graceful, &s;o that he united whatever could claim the approbation of the Great, and charm the eyes of the Fair. He had abilities to record the valour of the one, and celebrate the beauty of the other, and be|ing qualified by his genteel behaviour to entertain both, he became a fini&s;hed courtier. The fir&s;t dig|nity to which we find him preferred, was that of page to the king, a place of &s;o much honour and e&s;teem at that time, that Richard II. leaves particular lega|cies to his pages, when few others of his &s;ervants are taken notice of. In the forty-fir&s;t year of Ed|ward III. he received as a reward of his &s;ervices, an annuity of twenty marks per ann. payable out of the Exchequer, which in tho&s;e days was no incon&s;ider|able p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ion; in a year after he was advanced to be of his Maje&s;ty's privy chamber, and a very few months to be his &s;hield bearer, a title, at that time, (tho' now extinct) of very great honour, being always next the king's per&s;on, and generally upon &s;ignal victories rewarded with military honours. Our poet being thus eminent by his places, contracted friend|&s;hips, and procured the e&s;teem of per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality. Queen Philippa, the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, and his Duche&s;s Blanch, &s;hewed particular honour
<PB N="5" REF="10">
to him, and lady Margaret the king's daughter, and the counte&s;s of Pembroke gave him their warme&s;t patronage as a poet. In his poems called the Ro|maunt, and the Ro&s;e, and Troilus and Cre&s;eide, he gave offence to &s;ome court ladies by the loo&s;ene&s;s of his de&s;cription, which the lady Margaret re&s;ented, and obliged him to atone for it, by his Legend of good Women, a piece as cha&s;te as the others were luxuriou&s;ly amorous, and, under the name of the Dai&s;y, he veils lady Margaret, whom of all his patrons he mo&s;t e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Thus loved and honoured, his younger years were dedicated to plea&s;ure and the court. By the recom|mendation of the Dutche&s;s Blanch, he married one Philippa Rouet, &s;i&s;ter to the guardiane&s;s of her grace's children, who was a native of Hainault: He was then about thirty years of age, and being fixed by marriage, the king began to employ him in more public and advantageous po&s;ts. In the forty-&s;ixth year of his maje&s;ty's reign, Chaucer was &s;ent to Venice in commi&s;&s;ion with others, to treat with the Doge and Senate of Genoa, about affairs of great importance to our &s;tate. The duke of Lanca&s;ter, who&s;e favourite pa&s;&s;ion was ambition, which de|manded the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of learned men, engaged warmly in our poet's intere&s;t; be&s;ides, the duke was remarkably fond of Lady Catherine Swynford, his wi&s;e's &s;i&s;ter, who was then guardiane&s;s to his chil|dren, and whom he afterwards made his wife; thus was he doubly attached to Chaucer, and with the varying fortune of the duke of Lanca&s;ter we fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d him ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e or fall. Much about this time, for his &s;ucce&s;sful negociations at Genoa, the king grant|ed to him by letters patent, by the title of Armiger No&s;ter, one pitcher of vine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aily in the port of London, and &s;oon after mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> him comptroller of the cu&s;toms, with this particular provi&s;o, that he &s;hould per&s;onally execute the office, and write the accounts relating to it with his own hand.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11">
But as he was advanced to higher places of tru&s;t, &s;o he became more entangled in the affairs of &s;tate, the con&s;equence of which proved very prejudicial to him. The duke of Lanca&s;ter having been the chief in&s;trument of rai&s;ing him to dignity, expected the fruits of tho&s;e favours in a ready compliance with him in all his de&s;igns. That prince was cer|tainly one of the proude&s;t and mo&s;t ambitious men of his time, nor could he patiently bear the name of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> even to his father; nothing but ab|&s;olute power, and the title of king could &s;atisfy him; upon the death of his elder brother, Edward the black prince, he fixed an eye upon the Engli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">own, and &s;eemed to &s;tretch out an impatient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> it. In this view he &s;ought, by all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ecure his intere&s;t again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of the old king; and being afraid of the oppo&s;ition of the clergy, who are always &s;trenu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> again&s;t an irregular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he embraced the opinions and e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;ts of Wickliff, who now appeared at Oxford, and being a man of very great abilities, and much e&s;teemed at court, drew over to his party great numbers, as well fa&s;hi|onable as low people. In this confu&s;ion, the duke of Lanca&s;ter endeavoured all he could to &s;hake the power of the clergy, and to procure votaries a|mong&s;t the leading popular men. Chaucer had no &s;mall hand in promoting the&s;e proceedings, both by his public intere&s;t and writings. Towards the clo&s;e of Edward's reign, he was very active in the in|trigues of the court party, and &s;o recommended him&s;elf to the Prince &s;ucce&s;&s;or, that upon his a&s;|conding the throne, he confirmed to him by the ti|tle of Dilect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s Armiger No&s;ter, the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ant made by the late king of twenty marks per annum, and at the &s;ame time confirmed the other grant of the late King for a pitcher of wine to be delivered him daily in the port of London.

<PB N="7" REF="12">
King in order to &s;creen him from his creditors, took him under his protection, and allowed him &s;till to enjoy his former grants. The duke of Lanca&s;ter, who&s;e re&s;tle&s;s ambition ever excited him to di&s;turb the &s;tate, engaged now with all the intere&s;t of which he was ma&s;ter to promote him&s;elf to the crown; the opinions of Wickliff gained ground, and &s;o great a commotion now prevailed among&s;t the clergy, that the king perceiving the &s;tate in danger, and being willing to &s;upport the clerical intere&s;t, &s;uffered the archbi&s;hop of Cant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rbury to &s;ummon Wickliff to appear before him, who&s;e intere&s;t after this arraignment very much decayed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some biographers of Chaucer &s;ay, that pope Gregory IX. gave orders to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury to &s;ummon him, and that when a &s;ynod was convened at St. Paul's, a quarrel happened between the bi&s;hop of London and the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter, concerning Wickliff's &s;itting down in their pre&s;ence.</NOTE> The king who was devoted to his plea&s;ures, re&s;igned him&s;elf, to &s;ome young courtiers who hated the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter, and cau&s;ed a fryar to accu&s;e him of an at|tempt to kill the king; but before he had an op|portunity of making out the charge again&s;t him, the fryar was murdered in a cruel and barbarous manner by lord John Holland, to who&s;e care he had been committed. This lord John Holland, called lord Huntington, and duke of Exeter, was half brother to the king, and had married Elizabeth, daughter of the duke of Lanca&s;ter. He was a great patron of Chaucer, and much re&s;pected by him. With the duke of Lanca&s;ter's intere&s;t Chaucer's al&s;o &s;unk. His patron being unable to &s;upport him, he could no longer &s;truggle again&s;t oppo&s;ite parties, or main|tain his po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of honour. The duke pa&s;&s;ing over &s;ea, his friends felt all the malice of an enraged court; which induced them to call in a number of the populace to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, of which our poet was a zealous promoter. One John of Northampton, a late lord mayor of London was at the head of the&s;e di&s;turbances; which did not long continue; for up|on

Strict &s;earch was made after Chaucer, who e&s;caped into Hainault; afterwards he went to France, and finding the king re&s;olute to get him into his hands, he fled from thence to Zealand. Several accom|plices in this affair were with him, whom he &s;up|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rted in their exile, while the chief ringleaders, (except Northampton who was condemned at Rea|ding upon the evidence of his clerk) had re&s;tored them&s;elves to court favour by acknowledging their crime, and now forgot the integrity and re&s;olution of Chaucer, who &s;uffered exile to &s;ecure their &s;ecrets; and &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly ungrateful were they, that they wi&s;hed his death, and by keeping &s;upplies of mo|ney from him, endeavoured to effect it;&mdash;While he expended his fortune in removing from place to place, and in &s;upporting his fellow exiles, &s;o far from receiving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England, his apartments were let, and the money received for rent was never acccounted for to him; nor could he recover any from tho&s;e who owed it him, they being of opinion it was impo&s;&s;ible for him ever to return to his own country. The government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> pur&s;uing their re&s;entment again&s;t him and his friends, they were obliged to leave Zealand, and Chaucer being unable to bear longer the cala|mities of poverty and exile, and finding no &s;ecu|rity wherever he fled, cho&s;e rather to throw him|&s;elf upon the laws of his country, than peri&s;h a|broad by hunger and oppre&s;&s;ion. He had not long returned till he was arre&s;ted by order of the king, and confined in the tower of London. The court &s;ometimes flattered him with the return of the royal favour if he would impeach his accom|plices, and &s;ometimes threatened him with im|mediate de&s;truction; their threats and promi&s;es he along while di&s;regarded, but recollecting the ingratitude of his old friends, and the mi&s;eries
<PB N="9" REF="14">
he had already &s;uffered, he at la&s;t made a con|fe&s;&s;ion, and according to the cu&s;tom of trials at that time, offered to prove the truth of it by combat. What the con&s;equence of this di&s;covery was to his accomplices, is uncertain, it no doubt expo&s;ed him to their re&s;entment, and procured him the name of a traytor; but the king, who regarded him as one beloved by his grandfather, was plea&s;ed to pardon him. Thus fallen from a heighth of greatne&s;s, our poet retired to bemoan the &s;icklene&s;s of fortune, and then wrote his Te&s;ta|ment of Love, in which are many pathetic excla|mations concerning the vici&s;&s;itude of human things, which he then bitterly experienced. But as he had formerly been the favourite of fortune, when dignities were multiplied thick upon him, &s;o his mi&s;eries now &s;ucceeded with an equal &s;wiftne&s;s; he was not only di&s;carded by his maje&s;ty, unpen&s;ioned, and abandoned, but he lo&s;t the favour of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, as the influence of his wife's &s;i&s;ter with that prince was now much le&s;&s;ened. The duke being dejected with the troubles in which he was involved, began to reflect on his vicious cour&s;e of life, and particularly his keeping that lady as his concubine; which produced a re&s;olu|tion of putting her out of his hou&s;e, and he made a vow to that purpo&s;e. Chaucer, thus reduced, and weary of the perpetual turmoils at court, retired to Wood&s;tock, to enjoy a &s;tudious quiet; where he wrote his excellent treati&s;e of the A&s;trolabe; but notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere treatment of the govern|ment, he &s;till retained his loyalty, and &s;trictly en|joined his &s;on to pray for the king. As the pious re&s;olutions of &s;ome people are often the con&s;equence of a pre&s;ent evil, &s;o at the return of pro&s;perity they are &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated. This proved the ca&s;e with the duke of Lanca&s;ter: his party again gathered &s;trength, his intere&s;t began to ri&s;e; upon which he took a|gain his mi&s;tre&s;s to his bo&s;om, and not content with
<PB N="10" REF="15">
heaping favours, honours, and titles upon her, he made her his wife, procured an act of parliament to legitimate her children, which gave great offence to the duche&s;s of Glouce&s;ter, the counte&s;s of Derby, and Arundel, as &s;he then was entitled to take place of them. With her intere&s;t, Chaucer's al&s;o return|ed, and after a long and bitter &s;torm, the &s;un began to &s;hine upon him with an evening ray; for at the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age, the king granted to him, by the title of Delectus Armiger No&s;ter, an annuity of twenty marks per annum during his life, as a compen&s;ation for the former pen&s;ion his needy cir|cum&s;tances obliged him to part with; but however &s;ufficient that might be for pre&s;ent &s;upport, yet as he was encumbered with debts, he dur&s;t not appear pub|lickly till his maje&s;ty again granted him his royal protection to &s;creen him from the per&s;ecution of his creditors; he al&s;o re&s;tored to him his grant of a pitcher of wine daily, and a pipe annually, to be delivered to him by his &s;on Thomas, who that year po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the office of chief butler to the king.</P>
<P>Now that I have mentioned his &s;on, it will not be improper, to take a view of our author's dome&s;|tical affairs, at lea&s;t as far as we are enabled, by ma|terials that have de&s;cended to our times.</P>
<P>Thomas his elde&s;t &s;on, was married to one of the greate&s;t fortunes in England, Maud, daughter and heir of Sir John Burgheer&s;he, knight of the garter, and Dr. Henry Burghur&s;he bi&s;hop of Lincoln, chan|cellor and trea&s;urer of England. Mr. Speight &s;ays this lady was given him in marriage by Edward III. in return of his &s;ervices performed in his em|ba&s;&s;ies in France. His &s;econd &s;on Lewis was born in 1381, for when his father wrote the treati&s;e of the A&s;trolabe, he was ten years old; he was then a &s;tudent in Merton college in Oxford, and pupil to Nicholas Strade, but there is no further account of him. Thomas who now enjoyed the office of chief butler to his maje&s;ty, had the &s;ame place confirmed
<PB N="11" REF="16">
to him for life, by letters patent to king Henry IV, and continued by Henry VI. In the 2d year of Henry IV, we find him Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, Sheriff of Oxford&s;hire and Berk&s;hire, and Con&s;table of Wallingford ca&s;tle and Knaresborough ca&s;tle during life. In the 6th year of the &s;ame prince, he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to France. In the 9th of the &s;ame reign the Commons pre&s;ented him their Speaker; as they did likewi&s;e in the 11th year. Soon after this Queen Jane, granted to him for his good &s;ervice, the manor of Wood&s;tock, Hanner|borough and Wotten during life; and in the 13th year, he was again pre&s;ented Speaker as he was in the 2d of Henry V, and much about that time he was &s;ent by the king, to treat of a marriage with Ca|therine daughter to the duke of Burgundy; he was &s;ent again amba&s;&s;ador to France, and pa&s;&s;ed thro' a great many public &s;tations. Mr. Stebbing &s;ays that he was knighted, but we find no &s;uch title given him in any record. He died at Ewelm, the chief place of his re&s;idence, in the year 1434. By his wife Maud he had one daughter named A|lice, who was thrice married, fir&s;t to Sir John Phi|lips, and afterwards to Thomas Montacute earl of Salisbury: her third husband was the famous Wil|liam de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, who lo&s;t his head by the fury of the Yorki&s;ts, who dreaded his in|fluence in the oppo&s;ite party, tho' he &s;tood pro|&s;cribed by the parliament of Henry VI. for mi&s;|guiding that ea&s;y prince. Their &s;on John had three &s;ons, the &s;econd of whom, Edmund, forfeited his life to the crown for trea&s;on again&s;t Henry VII, by which means the e&s;tates which Chaucer's family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed came to the crown. But to return to our poet: By means of the duke of Lanca&s;ter's marriage with his &s;i&s;ter in law, he again grew to a con&s;idera|ble &s;hare of wealth; but being now about &s;eventy years of age, and fatigued with a tedious view of hurried greatne&s;s, he quitted the &s;tage of grandeur

where he had acted &s;o con&s;iderable a part with varied &s;ucce&s;s, and retired to Dunnigton ca&s;tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Camden gives a particular de&s;cription of this ca&s;tle.</NOTE> near Newbury, to reflect at lei&s;ure upon pa&s;t tran|&s;actions in the &s;till retreats of contemplation. In this retirement did he &s;pend his few remaining years, univer&s;ally loved and honoured; he was fa|miliar with all men of learning in his time, and con|tracted friend&s;hip with per&s;ons of the greate&s;t emi|nence as well in literature as politics; Gower, Occleve, Lidgate, Wickliffe were great admirers, and particular friends of Chaucer; be&s;ides he was well acquainted with foreign poets, particularly Francis Petrarch the famous Italian poet, and re|finer of the language. A Revolution in England &s;oon after this happened, in which we find Chaucer but little concerned; he made no mean compliments to Henry IV, but Gower his cotemporary, though then very old, flattered the reigning prince, and in&s;ulted the memory of his murdered Sovereign. All acts of parliament and grantsin the la&s;t reign being annulled, Chaucer again repaired to Court to get fre&s;h grants, but bending with age and weakne&s;s, tho' he was &s;ucce&s;sful in his reque&s;t, the fatigue of atten|dance &s;o overcame him, that death prevented his en|joying his new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He died the 25th of Octo|ber in the year 1400, in the &s;econd of Henry IV, in the 72d of his age, and bore the &s;hock of death with the &s;ame fortitude and re&s;ignati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n with which he had undergone a variety of pre&s;&s;ures, and vici&s;&s;i|tudes of fortune.</P>
<P>Dryden &s;ays, he was poet laureat to three kings, but Urry is of opinion that Dryden mu&s;t be mi&s;tak|en, as among all his works not one court poem is to be found, and Selden ob&s;erves, that he could find no poet honoured with that title in England before the reign of Edward IV, to whom one John Kaye dedicated the Siege of Rhodes in pro&s;e by the title of his Humble Poet Laureat.</P>

He knew how to judge of and excu&s;e the &s;lips of weaker capa|cities, and pitied rather than expo&s;ed the igno|rance of that age. In one word, he was a great &s;cholar, a plea&s;ant wit, a candid critic, a &s;ocia|ble companion, a &s;tedfa&s;t friend, a great philo|&s;opher, a temperate oeconomi&s;t, and a pious chri&s;tian."</Q> As to his genius as a poet, Dryden (than whom a higher authority cannot be produced) &s;peaking of Homer and Virgil, po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that our author exceeded the latter, and &s;tands in competition with the former.</P>

Of Langland's family we have no account. Selden in his notes on Draiton's Poly Olbion, quotes him with honour; but he is entirely neglected by Philips and Win|&s;tanly, tho' he &s;eems to have been a man of great genius: Be&s;ides Chaucer, few poets in that or the &s;ub&s;equent age had more real in&s;piration or po|etical enthu&s;ia&s;m in their compo&s;itions.

<P>FLouri&s;hed in the reign of Edward III, and Richard II. He was cotemporary with Chaucer and much e&s;teemed and honoured by him, as appears by his &s;ubmitting his Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida to his cen&s;ure. Stow in his Survey of London &s;eems to be of opinion that he was no knight, but only an e&s;quire; however, it is certain he was de&s;cended of a knightly family, at Sitten|ham in York&s;hire. He received his education in London, and &s;tudied the law, but being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great fortune, he dedicated him&s;elf more to plea&s;ure and poetry than the bar; tho' he &s;eems not to have made any proficiency in poetry, for his works are rather cool tran&s;lations, than originals, and are quite de&s;titute of poetical fire.

He was under the highe&s;t obli|gations to Richard II; he had been preferred, patronized and honoured by him, yet no &s;ooner did that unhappy prince (who owed his misfor|tunes in a great mea&s;ure to his genero&s;ity and ea&s;i|ne&s;s of nature) fall a &s;acrifice to the policy of Hen|ry and the rage of rebellion, but he wor&s;hiped the Ri&s;ing Sun, he joined his intere&s;t with the new king, and tho' he was then &s;tone-blind, and, as might naturally be imagined, too old to de&s;ire either riches or power, yet he was capable of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t flattery to the reigning prince, and like an ungrate|fal mon&s;ter in&s;ulted the memory of his murdered &s;overeign and generous patron. He &s;urvived Chau|cer two years; Win&s;tanly &s;ays, that in his old age he was made a judge, po&s;&s;ibly in con&s;equence of his adulation to Henry IV. His death happen|ed in the year 1402, and as he is &s;aid to have been born &s;ome years before Chaucer, &s;o he mu&s;t have been near four&s;core years of age: He was buried in St. Mary Overy's in Southwark, in the chapel of St. John, where he founded a chauntry, and le&s;t money for a ma&s;s to be daily &s;ung for him, as al&s;o an obit within the church to be kept on Friday after the fea&s;t of St. Gregory.

<P>JOHN HARDING, the famous Engli&s;h Chro|nologer, was born (&s;ays Bale) in the Northern parts, and probably York&s;hire, being an E&s;quire of an eminent parentage. He was a man ad|dicted both to arms and arts, in the former of

which he &s;eems to have been the greate&s;t profi|cient: His fir&s;t military exploit was under Robert Um<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">reuil, governor of Roxborough Ca&s;tle, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf again&s;t the Scots, before which the King of Scotland was then encamped, and unfortunately lo&s;t his life. He afterwards followed the &s;tandard of Edward IV. to who&s;e in|tere&s;t both in pro&s;perity and di&s;tre&s;s he honourably adhered. But what endeared him mo&s;t to the fa|vour of that Prince, and was indeed the ma&s;ter|piece of his &s;ervice, was his adventuring into Scot|land, and by his courteous in&s;inuating behaviour, &s;o far ingratiating him&s;elf into the favour of their leading men, that he procured the privilege of looking into their records and original letters, a copy of which he brought to England and pre|&s;ented to the King. This &s;ucce&s;sful atchievement e&s;tabli&s;hed him in his Prince's affections, as he was &s;ollicitous to know how often the Kings of Scotland had taken oaths of fealty and &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Engli&s;h Monarchs in order to &s;ecure their crown. The&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions are warmly di&s;puted by the Scotch hi&s;torians, who in honour of their country contend that they were only yielded for Cumberland and &s;ome parcels of land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them in Eng|land &s;outh of Tweed; and indeed when the warlike temper and invincible &s;pirit of that nation is con&s;idered, it is more than probable, that the Scotch hi&s;torians in this particular contend only for truth. Our author wrote a chronicle in ver&s;e of all our Engli&s;h Kings from Brute to King Edward IV. for which Dr. Fuller and Win&s;tanly be&s;tow great encomiums upon him; but he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ems to me to be totally de&s;titu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e of poetry, both from the wretch|edne&s;s of his lines, and the unhappine&s;s of his &s;ubject, a chronicle being of all others the drie&s;t, and the lea&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of poetical ornament; but let the reader judge by the &s;pecimen &s;ubjoined.

<HEAD>JOHN SKELTON</HEAD>
<P>WAS born of an ancient family in Cumber|land, he received his education at Oxford, and entering into holy orders was made rector of Dy&s;&s;o in Norfolk in the reign of Henry VIII. tho' more probably he appeared fir&s;t in that of Henry VII. and may be &s;aid to be the growth of that time.

He lived near four&s;core years after Chaucer, but
<PB N="28" REF="33">
&s;eems to have made but little improvement in ver|&s;ification. He wrote &s;ome bitter &s;atires again&s;t the clergy, and particularly, his keen reflections on Cardinal Wol&s;ey drew on him &s;uch &s;evere pro&s;ecu|tions, that he was obliged to fly for &s;anctuary to We&s;tmin&s;ter, under the protection of I&s;lip the Abbot, where he died in the year 1529. It appears by his poem entitled, The Crown of Laurel, that his per|formances were numerous, and &s;uch as remain are chiefly the&s;e, Philip Sparrow, Speak Parrot, the Death of King Edward IV. a Treati&s;e of the Scots, Ware the Hawk, the Tunning of Elianer Rumpkin. In the&s;e pieces there is a very rich vein of wit and humour, tho' much deba&s;ed by the ru&s;t of the age he lived in. His &s;atires are remarkably broad, open and ill-bred; the ver&s;e cramped by a very &s;hort mea&s;ure, and encumbered with &s;uch a pro|fu&s;ion of rhimes, as makes the poet appear almo&s;t as ridiculous as tho&s;e he endeavours to expo&s;e. In his more &s;erious pieces he is not guilty of this ab|&s;urdity; and confines him&s;elf to a regular &s;tanza, according to the then reigning mode. His Bouge of Court is a poem of &s;ome merit: it abounds with wit and imagination, and &s;hews him well ver&s;ed in human nature, and the in&s;inuating manners of a court. The allegorical characters are finely de&s;crib|ed, and well &s;u&s;tained; the fabric of the whole I believe entirely his own, and not improbably may have the honour of furni&s;hing a hint even to the in|imitable Spencer. How or by who&s;e intere&s;t he was made Laureat, or whether it was a title he a&s;|&s;umed to him&s;elf, cannot be determined, neither is his principal patron any where named; but if his poem of the Crown Lawrel before mentioned has any covert meaning, he had the happine&s;s of having the Ladies for his friends, and the counte&s;s of Surry, the lady Elizabeth Howard, and ma|ny others united their &s;ervices in his favour. When on his death-bed he was charged with

having children by a mi&s;tre&s;s he kept, he pro|te&s;ted that in his con&s;cience he kept her in the notion of a wife: And &s;uch was his cowardice, that he cho&s;e rather to confe&s;s adultery than own marriage, a crime at that time more &s;ubjected to puni&s;hment than the other.</P>

<P>HE was an author of &s;ome eminence and merit, tho' there are few things pre&s;erved concerning him, and he has been neglected by almo&s;t all the biographers of the poets. That excellent writer Mrs. Cooper &s;eems to have a pretty high opinion of his abilities; it is certain that he very con&s;iderably refined the language, and his ver&s;es are much &s;moother than tho&s;e of Harding, who wrote but a few years before him. He &s;tiles him&s;elf Prie&s;t, and Chaplain in the College of St. Mary, Otory, in the county of Devon, and afterwards Monk of Ely. His principal work is a tran&s;lation of a &s;atirical piece, written originally in high Dutch, and enti|tied the Ship of Fools: It expo&s;es the characters, vices, and follies of all degrees of men, and tho' much inferior in its execution to the Canterbury Tales, has yet con&s;iderable merit, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered how barren and unpolite the age was in which he flouri&s;hed. In the prologue to this he makes an apology for his youth, and it appears that the whole was fini&s;hed Anno Dom. 1508, which was about the clo&s;e of the reign of Henry VII. In elegancy of manners he has the advan|tage of all his predece&s;&s;ors, as is particularly re|markable in his addre&s;s to Sir Giles Alington, his patron.

<HEAD>Sir THOMAS MORE.</HEAD>
<P>THO' poetry is none of the excellencies in which this great man was di&s;tingui&s;hed, yet as he wrote &s;ome ver&s;es with tolerable &s;pirit, and was in almo&s;t every other re&s;pect one of the foremo&s;t geni|u&s;&s;es our nation ever produced, I imagine a &s;hort account of his life here will not be di&s;agreable to the readers, e&s;pecially as all Biographers of the Poets before me have taken notice of him, and ranked him among&s;t the number of Bards. Sir Thomas More was born in Milk-&s;treet, London, A. D. 1480. He was &s;on to Sir John More, Knight, and one of the Ju&s;tices of the King's-Bench, a man held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem at that time for his knowledge in the law and his integrity in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. It was objected by the enemies of Sir Thomas, that his birth was ob&s;cure, and his family mean; but far otherwi&s;e was the real ca&s;e. Judge More bore arms from his birth, having his coat of arms quartered, which proves his having come to his inheritance by de&s;cent. His mother was likewi&s;e a woman of family, and of an extraordinary virtue.</P>
<P>Doctor Clement relates from the authority of our author him&s;elf, a vi&s;ion which his mother had, the next night after her marriage. She thought &s;he &s;aw in her &s;leep, as it were engraven in her wedding ring, the number and countenances of all the chil|dren &s;he was to have, of whom the face of one
<PB N="33" REF="38">
was &s;o dark and ob&s;cure, that &s;he could not well di&s;cern it, and indeed &s;he afterwards &s;uffered an untimely delivery of one of them: the face of the other &s;he beheld &s;hining mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly, by which the future fame of Sir Thomas was pre-&s;ignified. She al&s;o bore two daughters. But tho' this &s;tory is told with warmth by his great grand&s;on, who writes his life, yet, as he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a Roman Catholic, and and di&s;po&s;ed to a &s;uper&s;titious belief in miracles and vi&s;ions, there is no great &s;tre&s;s to be laid upon it. Lady More might perhaps communicate this vi&s;ion to her &s;on, and he have embraced the belief of it; but it &s;eems to have too little authority, to de&s;erve credit from po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Another miracle is related by Stapleton, which is &s;aid to have happened in the infancy of More. His nur&s;e one day cro&s;&s;ing a river, and her hor&s;e &s;tepping into a deep place, expo&s;ed both her and the child to great danger. She being more anxious for the &s;afety of the child than her own, threw him over a hedge into a field adjoining, and e&s;caping likewi&s;e from the imminent danger, when &s;he came to take him up, &s;he found him quite unhurt and &s;miling &s;weetly upon her.</P>
<P>He was put to the free-&s;chool in London called St. Anthony's, under the care of the famous Nicholas Holt, and when he had with great rapidity acquired a know|ledge of his grammar rules, he was placed by his fa|ther's intere&s;t under the great Cardinal Merton, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, and Lord High Chancellor, who&s;e gravity and learning, genero&s;ity and tenderne&s;s, allured all men to love and honour him. To him More dedicated his Utopia, which of all his works is unexceptionably the mo&s;t ma&s;terly and fini&s;hed. The Cardinal finding him&s;elf too much incumbered with bu&s;ine&s;s, and hurried with &s;tate affairs to &s;uperin|tend his education, placed him in Canterbury College in Oxford, where by his a&s;&s;iduous application to books, his extraordinary temperance and vivacity of wit,
<PB N="34" REF="39">
he acquired the fir&s;t character among the &s;tudents, and then gave proo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of a genius that would one day make a great blaze in the world. When he was but eighteen years old &s;uch was the &s;orce of his under|&s;tanding, he wrote many epigrams which were high|ly e&s;teemed by men of eminence, as well abroad as at home. Beatus Rhenanus in his epi&s;tle to Bili|balus Pitchemerus, pa&s;&s;es great encomiums upon them, as al&s;o Leodgarius &agrave; Quercu, public reader of humanity at Paris. One Brixius a German, who env<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the reputation of this young epigra|mati&s;t, wrote a book again&s;t the&s;e epigrams, un|der the title of Antimorus, which had no other ef|fect than drawing Era&s;mus into the field, who cele|brated and honoured More; who&s;e high patronage was the greate&s;t compliment the mo&s;t ambitious writer could expect, &s;o that the friend&s;hip of Era&s;mus was cheapl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> purcha&s;ed by the malevolence of a thou&s;and &s;uch critics as Brixius. About the &s;ame time of life he tran&s;lated for his exerci&s;e one of Lu|cian's orations out of Greek into Latin, which he calls his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;t Fruits of the Greek Tongue; and adds another oration of his own to an&s;wer that of Lucian; for as he had defended him who had &s;lain a tyrant, he oppo&s;ed again&s;t it another with &s;uch forcible arguments, that it &s;eems not to be inferior to Lucian's, either in invention or elo|quence: Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n he was about twenty years old, finding his appetites and pa&s;&s;ions very predomi|nant, he &s;truggled with all the heroi&s;m of a chri|&s;tian again&s;t their influence, and inflicted &s;evere whippings and au&s;tere mortifications upon him&s;elf every friday and on high fa&s;ting days, le&s;t his &s;en|&s;uality &s;hould grow too in&s;olent, and at la&s;t &s;ubdue his rea&s;on. But notwith&s;tanding all his efforts, finding his lu&s;ts ready to endanger his &s;oul, he wi&s;ely determined to marry, a remedy much more natural than per&s;onal inflictions; and as a pattern of life, he propo&s;ed the example of a &s;ingular
<PB N="35" REF="40">
lay-man, John Picus Earl of Mirandula, who was a man famous for cha&s;tity, virtue, and learn|ing. He tran&s;lated this nobleman's life, as al&s;o many of his letters, and his twelve receipts of good life, which are extant in the beginning of his Engli&s;h works. For this end he al&s;o wrote a treati&s;e of the four la&s;t things, which he did not quite fini&s;h, being called to other &s;tudies.</P>
<P>At his meals he was very ab&s;temious, norever eat but of one di&s;h, which was mo&s;t commonly powdered beef, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;alt meat. In his youth he ab&s;tained wholly from wine; and as he was temperate in his diet, &s;o was he heedle&s;s and negligent in his appa|rel. Being once told by his &s;ecretary Mr. Harris, that his &s;hoes were all torn, he bad him tell his man to buy him new ones, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to take care of his cloaths, whom for this cau&s;e he called his tutor. His fir&s;t wife's name was Jane Cole, de&s;cended of a genteel family, who bore him four children, and upon her decea&s;e, which in not many years happened, he married a &s;econd time a widow, one Mrs. Alice Middleton, by whom he had no children. This he &s;ays he did not to indulge his pa&s;&s;ions (for he ob&s;erves that it it harder to keep cha&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y in wedlock than in a &s;ingle life,) but to take care of his children and hou&s;hold af|fairs. Upon what principle this ob&s;ervation is founded, I cannot well conceive, and wi&s;h Sir Thomas had given his rea&s;ons why it is harder to be cha&s;te in a married than &s;ingle life. This wife was a worldly minded woman, had a very indifferent per&s;on, was advanced in years, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed no very agreeable temper. Much about this time he became obnoxious to Henry VII. for op|po&s;ing his exactions upon the people. Henry was a covetous mean prince, and entirely devoted to the council of Em&s;on and Dudley, who then were very ju&s;tly reckoned the caterpillars of the &s;tate. The King demanded a large &s;ub&s;idy to be&s;tow
<PB N="36" REF="41">
on his elde&s;t daughter, who was then about to be married to James IV. of Scotland. Sir Thomas being one of the burge&s;&s;es, &s;o influenced the lower hou&s;e by the force of his arguments, (who were cowardly enough before not to oppo&s;e the King) that they refu&s;ed the demands, upon which Mr. Tiler of the King's Privy-Chambers went pre&s;ently to his Maje&s;ty, and told him that More had di&s;ap|pointed all their expectations, which circum&s;tance not a little enraged him again&s;t More. Upon this Henry was ba&s;e enough to pick a quarrel without a cau&s;e again&s;t Sir John More, his venerable father, and in revenge to the &s;on, clapt him in the Tower, keeping him there pri&s;oner till he had forced him to pay one hundred pounds of a fine, for no offence. King Henry &s;oon after dying, his &s;on who began his reign with &s;ome popular acts, tho' afterwards he de|generated into a mon&s;trous tyrant, cau&s;ed Dudley and Em&s;on to be impeached of high trea&s;on for giving bad advice to his father; and however illegal &s;uch an arraignment might be, yet they met the ju&s;t fate of oppre&s;&s;ors and traitors to their country,</P>
<P>About the year 1516, he compo&s;ed his famous book called the Utopia, and gained by it great re|putation. Soon after it was publi&s;hed, it was tran&s;|lated both into French and Italian, Dutch and Eng|li&s;h. Dr. Stapleton enumerates the opinions of a great many learned men in its favour. This work tho' not writ in ver&s;e, yet in regard of the fancy and invention employed in compo&s;ing it, may well enough pa&s;s for an allegorical poem. It contains the idea of a compleat Commonwealth in an ima|ginary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;land, (pretended to be lately di&s;covered in America) and that &s;o well counterfeited, that ma|ny upon reading it, mi&s;took it for a real truth, in &s;o much (&s;ays Win&s;tanly) that &s;ome learned men, as Budeus, Johannes Plaudanus, out of a principle of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rvent zeal, wi&s;hed that &s;ome excellent divines might be &s;ent hither to preach Chri&s;t's Go&s;pel.</P>

Much about the &s;ame time he wrote the hi&s;tory of Richard III. which was likewi&s;e held in e&s;teem; the&s;e works were undertaken when he was di&s;char|ged from the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Roper, in his life of our author, relates that upon an occa&s;ion in which King Henry VIII. and the Pope were parties in a cau&s;e tryed in the Star Chamber, Sir Thomas mo&s;t remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, and became &s;o great a favourite with that di&s;cern|ing monarch, that he could no longer forbear call|ing him into his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>A &s;hip of the Pope's, by the violence of a &s;torm was driven into Southampton, which the King claimed as a forfeiture; when the day of hearing came on before the Lord High Chancellor, and other Judges, More argued &s;o forcibly in fa|vour of the Pope, that tho' the Judges had re&s;olved to give it for the King, yet they altered their opinion, and confirmed the Pope's right. In a &s;hort time after this, he was created a Knight, and after the death of Mr. We&s;ton, he was made Trea&s;urer of the Exchequer, and one of the Pri|vy Council. He was now Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and thus exalted in dignity, the eyes of the nation were fixed upon him. Wol&s;ey, who then governed the realm, found him&s;elf much grieved by the Burge&s;&s;es, becau&s;e all their tran&s;ac|tions were &s;o &s;oon made public, and wanting a fre&s;h &s;ub&s;idy, came to the hou&s;e in per&s;on to complain of this u&s;age. When the burge&s;&s;es heard of his com|ing, it was long debated whether they &s;hould admit him or no, and Sir Thomas &s;trongly urged that he &s;hould be admitted, for this rea&s;on, that if he &s;hall find fault with the &s;preading of our &s;ecrets, (&s;ays he) we may lay the blame upon tho&s;e his Grace brought with him. The proud Churchman having entered the Hou&s;e, made a long &s;peech for granting the &s;ub&s;idy, and asked &s;everal of the Mem|bers opinion concerning it; they were all &s;o con|founded as not to be able to an&s;wer, and the Hou&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="43">
at la&s;t re&s;olved that their Speaker &s;hould reply for them. Upon this Sir Thomas &s;hewed that the cardinal's coming into the Hou&s;e was unprecedent|ed, illegal, and a daring in&s;ult on the liberty of the burge&s;&s;es, and that the &s;ub&s;idy demanded was unnece&s;&s;ary; upon which Wol&s;ey &s;uddenly departed in a rage, and ever after entertained &s;u&s;picions of More, and became jealous of his great abilities. Our author's fame was not con|fined to England only; all the &s;cholars and &s;tates|men in every country in Europe had heard of, and corre&s;ponded with him, but of all &s;trangers he had a peculiar e&s;teem for Era&s;mus, who took a jour|ney into England in order to conver&s;e with him, and enter more minutely into the merit of one who&s;e learning he had &s;o high an opinion of. They agreed to meet fir&s;t at my Lord Mayor's table, and as they were per&s;onally unknown, to make the experiment whether they could di&s;cover one ano|ther by conver&s;ation. They met accordingly, and remained &s;ome hours undi&s;covered; at la&s;t an argu|ment was &s;tarted in which both engaged with great keenne&s;s, Era&s;mus de&s;ignedly defended the unpo|pular &s;ide, but finding him&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed, that he could hold it no longer, he broke out in an exta&s;y, aut tu es Morus, aut Nullus. Upon which More replied, aut tu es Era&s;mus, aut Diabo|lus, as at that time Era&s;mus was &s;triving to defend very impious propo&s;itions, in order to put his an|tagoni&s;t's &s;trength to the proof.</P>
<P>When he lived in the city of London as a ju&s;tice of peace, he u&s;ed to attend the &s;e&s;&s;ions at New|gate. There was then upon the bench a vene|rable old judge, who was very &s;evere again&s;t tho&s;e who had their pur&s;es cut; (as the phra&s;e then was) and told them that it was by their negligence that &s;o many pur&s;e-cutters came before him. Sir Thomas, who was a great lover of a joke, contrived to have this judge's pur&s;e cut from him in the &s;e&s;&s;ions hou&s;e by a felon. When
<PB N="39" REF="44">
the felon was arraigned, he told the court, that if he were permitted to &s;peak to one of the judges in pri|vate, he could clear his innocence to them; they in|dulged him in his reque&s;t, and he made choice of this old judge, and while he whi&s;pered &s;omething in his ear, he &s;lily cut away his pur&s;e; the judge returned to the bench, and the felon made a &s;ign to Sir Thomas of his having accompli&s;hed the &s;cheme. Sir Thomas moved the court, that each of them &s;hould be&s;tow &s;ome alms on a needy per&s;on who then &s;tood fal&s;ly accu&s;ed, and was a real object of compa&s;&s;ion. The motion was agreed to, and when the old man came to put his hand in his pur&s;e, he was a&s;toni&s;hed to find it gone, and told the court, that he was &s;ure he had it when he came there. What, &s;ays More in a plea&s;ant manner, do you charge any of us with felony? the judge beginning to be angry, our facetious author de|&s;ired the felon to return his pur&s;e, and advi&s;ed the old man never to be &s;o bitter again&s;t innocent mens negligence, when he him&s;elf could not keep his pur&s;e &s;afe in that open a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Although he lived a courtier, and was much concerned in bu&s;ine&s;s, yet he never neglected his family at home, but in&s;tructed his daughters in all u&s;eful learning, and conver&s;ed familiarly with them; he was remarkably fond of his elde&s;t daugh|ter Margaret, as &s;he had a greater capacity, and &s;prightlier genius than the re&s;t. His children often u&s;ed to tran&s;late out of Latin into Engli&s;h, and out of Engli&s;h into Latin, and Dr. Stapleton ob|&s;erves, that he hath &s;een an apology of Sir Tho|mas More's to the univer&s;ity of Oxford, in defence of learning, turned into Latin by one of his daugh|ters, and tran&s;lated again into Engli&s;h by another. Margaret, who&s;e wit was &s;uperior to the re&s;t, writ a treati&s;e on the four la&s;t things, which Sir Thomas declared was finer than his; &s;he compo&s;ed &s;everal Orations, e&s;pecially one in an&s;wer to Quin|tilian,
<PB N="40" REF="45">
defending a rich man, which he accu&s;ed for having poi&s;oned a poor man's bees with certain venomous flowers in his garden, &s;o eloquent and forcible that it may ju&s;tly rival Quintilian him&s;elf. She al&s;o tran&s;lated Eu&s;ebius out of Greek.</P>
<P>Tho' Sir Thomas was thus involved in public af|fairs and dome&s;tic concerns, yet he found lei&s;ure to write many books, either again&s;t Heretics, or of a de|votional ca&s;t; for at that time, what he reckoned Here&s;y began to diffu&s;e it&s;elf over all Germany and Flanders. He built a chapel in his pari&s;h church at Chel&s;ea, which he con&s;tantly attended in the morning; &s;o &s;teady was he in his devotion. He hired a hou&s;e al&s;o for many aged people in the pari&s;h, which he turned into an ho&s;pital, and &s;up|ported at his own expence. He at la&s;t ro&s;e to the dignity of Lord High Chancellor upon the fall of Wol&s;ey, and while he &s;at as the Chief Judge of the nation in one court, his father, aged upwards of 90, &s;at as Chief Ju&s;tice in the King's Bench; a circum&s;tance which never before, nor ever &s;ince happened, of a father being a Judge, and his &s;on a Chancellor at the &s;ame time. Every day, as the Chancellor went to the Bench, he kneeled before his father, and asked his ble&s;&s;ing. The people &s;oon found the difference between the intolerable pride of Wol&s;ey, and the gentlene&s;s and humility of More; he permitted every one to approach him without re&s;erve; he di&s;patched bu&s;ine&s;s with great a&s;&s;iduity, and &s;o cleared the court of tedious &s;uits, that he more than once came to the Bench, and calling for a cau&s;e, there was none to try. As no dignity could in&s;pire him with pride, &s;o no appli|cation to the mo&s;t important affairs could divert him from &s;allies of humour, and a plea&s;antry of behaviour. It once happened, that a beggar's little dog which &s;he had lo&s;t, was pre&s;ented to lady More. of which &s;he was very fond; but at la&s;t the beggar getting no|tice where the dog was, &s;he came to complain to
<PB N="41" REF="46">
Sir Thomas as he was &s;itting in his hall, that his lady withheld her dog from her; pre&s;ently my lady was &s;ent for, and the dog brought with her, which he taking in his hand, cau&s;ed his wife to &s;tand at the upper end of the hall, and the beggar at the other; he then bad each of them call the dog, which when they did, the dog went pre&s;ently to the beggar, for&s;aking my lady. When he &s;aw this, he bad my lady be contented for it was none of hers. My Lord Chancellor then gave the woman a piece of gold, which would have bought ten &s;uch dogs, and bid her be careful of it for the future.</P>
<P>A friend of his had &s;pent much time in com|po&s;ing a book, and went to Sir Thomas to have his opinion of it; he de&s;ired him to turn it into rhime; which at the expence of many years la|bour he at la&s;t accompli&s;hed, and came again to have his opinion: Yea marry, &s;ays he, now it is &s;omewhat; now it is rhime, but before it was nei|ther rhime nor rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But fortune, which had been long propitious to our author, began now to change &s;ides, and try him as well with affliction as pro&s;perity, in both which characters, his behaviour, integrity and courage were irreproachable. The amorous monarch King Henry VIII, at la&s;t obtained from his Parliament and Council a divorce from his lawful wife, and being pa&s;&s;ionately fond of Anna Bullen, he mar|red her, and declared her Queen of England: This marriage Sir Thomas had always oppo&s;ed, and held it unlawful for his Sovereign to have another wife during his fir&s;t wife's life. The Queen who was of a petulant di&s;po&s;ition, and elated with her new dignity could not withhold her re&s;entment again&s;t him, but animated all her relations, and the par|ties inclined to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, to per&s;ecute him with rigour. Not long after the divorce, the Council gave authority for the publication of a book, in which the rea&s;ons why this divorce was
<PB N="42" REF="47">
granted were laid down; an an&s;wer was &s;oon pub|li&s;hed, with which Sir Thomas More was charged as the author, of which report however he &s;uffi|ciently cleared him&s;elf in a letter to Mr. Crom|wel, then &s;ecretary, and a great favourite with King Henry. In the parliament held in the year 1534, there was an oath framed, called the Oath of Supremacy, in which all Engli&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hould renounce the pope's authority, and &s;wear al&s;o to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Queen Ann's children, and lady Mary illegitimate. This oath was given to all the clergy as well bi&s;hops as prie&s;ts, but no lay-man except Sir Thomas More was de&s;ired to take it; he was &s;ummoned to appear at Lambeth before archbi&s;hop Cranmer, the Lord Chancellor Audley, Mr. &s;ecretary Cromwel, and the abbot of We&s;tmin|&s;ter, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners by the King to ten|der this oath. More ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to take it, from a principle of con&s;cience: and after vari|ous expo&s;tulations he was ordered into the cu&s;to|dy of the abbot of We&s;tmin&s;ter; and &s;oon after he was &s;ent to the tower, and the lieutenant had &s;trict charge to prevent his writing, or holding conver|&s;ation with any per&s;ons but tho&s;e &s;ent by the &s;ecre|tary. The Lord Chancellor, duke of Norfolk, and Mr. Cromwel paid him frequent vi&s;its, and pre&s;&s;ed him to take the oath, which he &s;till refu&s;ed. A|bout a year after his commitment to the tower, by the importunity of Queen Ann, he was arrign'd at the King's Bench Bar, for ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing the oath of &s;upremacy, and wilfully and ob&s;ti|nately oppo&s;ing the King's &s;econd marriage. He went to the court leaning on his &s;taff, becau&s;e he had been much weakened by his impri&s;onment; his judges were, Audley, Lord Chancellor; Fitz James, Chief Ju&s;tice: Sir John Baldwin, Sir Ri|chard Lei&s;ter, Sir John Port, Sir John Spelman, Sir Walter Luke, Sir Anthony Fitzherbert: The King's attorney opened again&s;t him with a very op|probious
<PB N="43" REF="48">
libel; the chief evidence were Mr. &s;ecreta|ry Cromwell, to whom he had uttered &s;ome di&s;re|pectful expre&s;&s;ions of the King's authority, the duke of Suffolk and earl of Wilt&s;hire: He replied to the accu&s;ation with great compo&s;ure and &s;trength of ar|gument; and when one Mr. Rich &s;wore again&s;t him, he boldly a&s;&s;erted that Rich was perjured, and wi&s;hed he might never &s;ee God's Countenance in mercy, if what he a&s;&s;erted was not true; be|&s;ides that, Rich added to perjury, the ba&s;ene&s;s of betraying private conver&s;ation. But notwith&s;tand|ing his defence, the jury, who were compo&s;ed of creatures of the court, brought in their verdict, guilty; and he had &s;entence of death pronounced again&s;t him, which he heard without emotion. He then made a long &s;peech addre&s;&s;ed to the Chan|cellor, and ob&s;erved to Mr. Rich, that he was more &s;orry for his perjury, than for the &s;entence that had ju&s;t been pronounced again&s;t him: Rich had been &s;ent by the &s;ecretary to take away all Sir Thomas's books and papers, during which time &s;ome conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, which Rich mi&s;re|pre&s;ented in order to advance him&s;elf in the King's favour. He was ordered again to the Tower till the King's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. When he landed at Tower Wharf, his favourite daughter Margaret, who had not &s;een him &s;ince his con|finement, came there to take her la&s;t adieu, and forgetting the ba&s;hfulne&s;s and delicacy of her &s;ex, pre&s;s'd thro' the multitude, threw her arms about her father's neck and often embraced him; they had but little conver&s;ation, and their parting was &s;o moving, that all the &s;pectators di&s;&s;olved in tears, and applauded the affection and tenderne&s;s of the lady which could enable her to take her farewel un|der &s;o many di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>Some time after his condemnation Mr. &s;ecretary Cromwel waited on Sir Thomas, and entreated him to accept his Maje&s;ty's pardon, upon the condition
<PB N="44" REF="49">
of taking the oath, and expre&s;&s;ed great tenderne&s;s towards him. This vi&s;it and &s;eeming friend&s;hip of Cromwel not a little affected him, he revolved in his mind the propo&s;al which he made, and as his fate was approaching, perhaps his re&s;olution &s;tag|gered a little, but calling to mind his former vows, his c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;cience, his honour, he recovered him&s;elf again, and &s;tood firmly prepared for his &s;all. Upon this occa&s;ion it was that he wrote the following ver&s;es, mentioned both by Mr. Roper and Mr. Hodde&s;on, which I &s;hall here in&s;ert as a &s;pecimen of his poetry.<Q><L>Ey flattering fortune, loke thou never &s;o fayre,</L>
<L>Or never &s;o plea&s;antly begin to &s;mile,</L>
<L>As tho' thou would'&s;t my ruine all repayre,</L>

<L>Tru&s;t &s;hall I God to entre in a while</L>
<L>His haven of heaven &s;ure and uniforme,</L>
<L>Ever after thy calme loke I for a &s;torme.</L></Q></P>
<P>On the 6th of July, 1534, in the 54th year of his age, the &s;entence of condemnation was executed upon him on Tower Hill, by &s;evering his head from his body. As he was carried to the &s;caffold, &s;ome low people hired by his enemies cruelly in&s;ulted him, to whom he gave cool and effectual an&s;wers. Being now under the &s;caffold, he looked at it with great calmne&s;s, and ob&s;erving it too &s;lenderly built, he &s;aid merrily to Mr. Lieutenant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I pray you, Sir, &s;ee me &s;afe up, and for my coming down let me &s;hift for my&s;elf."</Q> When he mounted on the &s;caffold, he threw his eyes round the multitude, de&s;ired them to pray for him, and to bear him wit|ne&s;s that he died for the holy catholic church, a faithful &s;ervant both to God and the King. His gaiety and propen&s;ion to je&s;ting did not for&s;ake him in his la&s;t moments; when he laid his head upon the block, he bad the executioner &s;tay till he
<PB N="45" REF="50">
had removed a&s;ide his beard, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that that had never committed trea&s;on."</Q> When the executioner asked his forgivene&s;s, he ki&s;&s;ed him and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thou wilt do me this day a greater benefit than any mortal man can be able to give me; pluck up thy &s;pirit man, and be not afraid to do thy office, my neck is very &s;hort, take heed therefore that thou &s;trike not awry for &s;aving thy hone&s;ty."</Q></P>
<P>Thus by an hone&s;t but mi&s;taken zeal fell Sir Thomas More; a man of wit and parts &s;uperior to all his cotemporaries; of integrity un&s;haken; of a generous and noble di&s;po&s;ition; of a courage in|trepid; a great &s;cholar and a devout chri&s;tian.

<HEAD>HENRY HOWARD, Earl of SURRY</HEAD>
<P>WAS &s;on of Thomas, duke of Norfolk, and Elizabeth, daughter of Edward, duke of Buckingham. The father of our author held the highe&s;t places under King Henry VIII, and had &s;o faithfully and bravely &s;erved him, that the no|bility grew jealous of his influence, and by their united efforts produced his ruin. After many ex|cellent &s;ervices in France, he was con&s;tituted Lord Trea&s;urer, and made General of the King's whole army de&s;ign'd to march again&s;t the Scots: At the battle of Flodden, in which the Scots were rout|ed and their Sovereign &s;lain, the earl of Surry re|markably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf; he commanded un|der his father, and as &s;oon as the jealou&s;y of the Peers had fa&s;tened upon the one, they took care that the other &s;hould not e&s;cape. He was the fir&s;t nobleman (&s;ays Camden) that illu&s;trated his high birth with the beauty of learning; he was acknow|ledged by all, to be the gallante&s;t man, the polite&s;t lover, and the mo&s;t compleat gentleman of his time. He received his education at Wind&s;or with a natural &s;on of Henry VIII, and became fir&s;t eminent for his devotion to the beautiful Geraldine, Maid of Honour to Queen Catherine; &s;he fir&s;t in&s;pired him
<PB N="48" REF="52">
with poetry, and that poetry has conferred immor|tality on her: So tran&s;ported was he with his pa&s;|&s;ion, that he made a tour to the mo&s;t elegant courts in Europe, to maintain her peerle&s;s beauty a|gain&s;t all oppo&s;ers, and every where made good his challenge with honour. In his way to Florence, he touched at the emperor's court, where he became acquainted with the learned Cornelius Agrippa, &s;o famous for magic, who &s;hewed him the image of his Geraldine in a gla&s;s, &s;ick, weeping on her bed, and melting into devotion for the ab&s;ence of her lord; upon &s;ight of this he wrote the follow|ing pa&s;&s;ionate &s;onnet, which for the &s;moothne&s;s of the ver&s;e, the tenderne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and the heart|felt &s;entiments might do honour to the polite&s;t, ea&s;i|e&s;t, mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate poet in our own times.<Q><LG TYPE="sonnet">

<P>From the emperor's court he went to the city of Florence, the pride and glory of Italy, in which city his beauteous Geraldine was born, and he had no re&s;t till he found out the hou&s;e of her nativity, and being &s;hewn the room where his charmer fir&s;t drew air, he was tran&s;ported with exta&s;y of joy, his tongue overflowed with her prai&s;es, and Win|&s;tanly &s;ays he eclip&s;ed the &s;un and moon with com|pari&s;ons of his Geraldine, and wrote another &s;on|net in prai&s;e of the chamber that was honoured (as he &s;ays) with her radiant conception; this &s;on|net is equally amorous and &s;pirited with that al|ready in&s;erted. In the duke of Florence's court he publi&s;hed a proud challenge again&s;t all comers, whether Chri&s;tians, Turks, Canibals, Jews, or Sa|racens, in defence of his mi&s;tre&s;s's beauty; this challenge was the better received there, as &s;he whom he defended was born in that city: The duke of Florence however &s;ent for him, and en|quired of his fortune, and the intent of his coming to his court; of which when the earl informed him, he granted to all countries whatever, as well ene|mies and outlaws, as friends and allies, free acce&s;s into his dominions unmole&s;ted till the trial were ended.</P>

In the cour&s;e of his combats for his mi&s;tre&s;s, his valour and skill in arms &s;o engaged the Duke to his intere&s;t, that he offered him the highe&s;t preferments if he would remain at his court.

During his command there in 1546, hearing that a convoy of provi&s;ions of the enemy was coming to the fort at Oultreaw, he re&s;olved to intercept it; but the Rhinegrave, with four thou&s;and Lanskinets, together with a con&s;idera|ble number of French under the de Bieg, making an ob&s;tinate defence, the Engli&s;h were routed, Sir Edward Poynings with divers other gentlemen kil|led, and the Earl him&s;elf obliged to fly, tho' it ap|pears, by a letter to the King dated January 8, 1548, that this advantage co&s;t the enemy a great number of men. But the King was &s;o highly di&s;plea&s;ed with this ill &s;ucce&s;s, that from that time he contracted a prejudice again&s;t the Earl, and &s;oon after removed him from his command, and appointed the Earl of Hertford to &s;ucceed him. Upon which Sir William Page wrote to the Earl of Surry to advi&s;e him to procure &s;ome eminent po&s;t under the Earl of Hert|ford, that he might not be unprovided in the town and field. The Earl being de&s;irous in the mean time to regain his former favour with the King, skirmi&s;hed with the French and routed them, but &s;oon after writing over to the King's council that

as the enemy had ca&s;t much larger cannon than had been yet &s;een, with which they imagined they &s;hould &s;oon demoli&s;h Boulogne, it de&s;erved con&s;i|deration whether the lower town &s;hould &s;tand, as not being defen&s;ible; the council ordered him to return to England in order to repre&s;ent his &s;enti|ments more fully upon tho&s;e points, and the Earl of Hertford was immediately &s;ent over in his room. This exa&s;perating the Earl of Surry, occa&s;ioned him to let fall &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which &s;avoured of revenge and di&s;like to the King, and a hatred of his Councellors, and was probably one cau&s;e of his ruin, which &s;oon after en&s;ued.

The Seymours failed not to in&s;pire the King with an aver&s;ion to the Norfolk|family, who&s;e power they dreaded, and repre&s;ented the ambitious views of the Earl of Surry; but to re|turn to him as a poet.</P>

Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent as to the rea&s;ons why the gallantries he per|formed for Geraldine did not i&s;&s;ue in a marriage. Perhaps the reputation he acquired by arms, might have enflamed his &s;oul with a love of glory; and this conjecture &s;eems the more probable, as we find his ambition prompting him to make love to the Prince&s;s from no other views but tho&s;e of dominion. He married Frances, daughter to John Earl of Ox|ford, after who&s;e death he addre&s;&s;ed Prince&s;s Mary, and his fir&s;t marriage, perhaps, might be owing to a de&s;ire of &s;trengthening his intere&s;t, and advancing his power in the realm. The adding &s;ome part of the royal arms to his own, was al&s;o made a pretence again&s;t him, but in this he was ju&s;tified by the he|ralds, as he proved that a power of doing &s;o was granted by &s;ome preceeding Monarchs to his fore|&s;athers. Upon the &s;trength of the&s;e &s;u&s;picions and &s;urmi&s;es, he and his father were committed to the Tower of London, the one by water, the other by land, &s;o that they knew not of each other's appre|hen&s;ion. The fifteenth day of January next follow|ing he was arraigned at Guildhall, where he was found guilty by twelve common jurymen, and re|ceived judgment. About nine days before the death of the King he lo&s;t his head on Tower-Hill; and had not that Monarch's decea&s;e &s;o &s;oon en&s;ued, the fate of his father was likewi&s;e determined to have been the &s;ame with his &s;ons.</P>

<P>In the year 1608, this great man died &s;udden|ly at the Council-Table, Whitehall, after a bu&s;tling life devoted to the public weal; and the 26th of May following, his remains were de|po&s;ited with great &s;olemnity in We&s;tmin&s;ter Ab|bey, his funeral &s;ermon being preached by Dr. Abbot, his chaplain, afterwards Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Be&s;ides this celebrated &s;ermon of the primate's, in which he is very lavi&s;h in his prai&s;e, Lord Chancellor Bacon, and Sir Robert Naunton, be&s;tow particular encomiums upon him; and Sir Richard Baker ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he had excellent parts, and in his place was exceeding indu&s;trious, and that he had heard many exchequer men &s;ay, there never was a better Trea&s;urer, both for the King's profit, and the good of the &s;ub|ject."</Q></P>

grief of the nation, for which he had &s;pent his &s;trength, and for who&s;e intere&s;t, in a very im|mediate manner, he may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to have fallen a &s;acrifice. Of all our court poets he &s;eems to have united the greate&s;t indu&s;try and variety of genius: It is &s;eldom found, that the &s;ons of Par|na&s;&s;us can devote them&s;elves to public bu&s;ine&s;s, or execute it with &s;ucce&s;s. I have already ob|&s;erved, that the world has lo&s;t many excellent works, which no doubt this cultivated genius would have accompli&s;hed, had he been le&s;s involved in court-affairs: but as he acted in &s;o public a &s;phere, and di&s;charged every office with inviolable honour, and con&s;ummate prudence, it is perhaps &s;omewhat &s;elfi&s;h in the lovers of poetry, to wi&s;h he had wrote more, and acted le&s;s. From him is de&s;cended the pre&s;ent noble family of the Dor&s;ets; and it is remarkable, that all the de&s;cendants of this great man have inherited his ta&s;te for liberal arts and &s;ciences, as well as his capacity for public bu&s;ine&s;s. An heir of his was the friend and pa|tron of Dryden, and is &s;tiled by Congreve the monarch of wit in his time, and the pre&s;ent age is happy in his illu&s;trious po&s;terity, rivalling for deeds of honour and renown the mo&s;t famous of their ance&s;tors.</P>

<HEAD>THOMAS CHURCHYARD,</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the Mirror of Magi&s;trates. He was born in the town of Shrewsbury <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Win&s;t. 61.</NOTE> as him&s;elf affirms in his book made in ver&s;e of the Worthine&s;s of Wales. He was equally addicted to arts and arms; he had a liberal education, and in|herited &s;ome fortune, real and per&s;onal; but he &s;oon exhau&s;ted it, in a tedious and unfruitful attendance at court, for he gained no other equivalent for that mortifying dependance, but the honour of being retained a dome&s;tic in the family of lord Surry: during which time by his lord&s;hip's encouragement he commenced poet. Upon his ma&s;ter's death he betook him&s;elf to arms; was in many engagements, and was frequently wounded; he was twice a pri&s;o|ner, and redeemed by the charity of two noble ladies, yet &s;till langui&s;hing in di&s;tre&s;s, and bitterly complaining of fortune. Neither of his employments afforded him a patron, who would do ju&s;tice to his ob|&s;cure merit; and unluckily he was as unhappy in his amours as in his circum&s;tances, &s;ome of his mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es treating his addre&s;&s;es with contempt, perhaps,
<PB N="64" REF="69">
on account of his poverty; for tho' it generally hap|pens that Poets have the greate&s;t power in court&s;hip, as they can celebrate their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with more ele|gance than people of any other profe&s;&s;ion; yet it very &s;eldom falls out that they marry &s;ucce&s;sfully, as their needy circum&s;tances naturally deter them from ma|king advances to Ladies of &s;uch fa&s;hion as their ge|nius and manners give them a right to addre&s;s. This proved our author's ca&s;e exactly; he made love to a widow named Browning, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very good jointure; but this lady being more in love with money than laurels, with wealth than merit, rejected his &s;uit; which not a little di&s;couraged him, as he had &s;pent his money in hopes of effecting this match, which, to his great mortification, all his rhimes and &s;onnets could not do. He dedicated his works to Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton; but addre&s;&s;es of that nature don't always imply a provi&s;ion for their author. It is conjectured that he died about the eleventh year of Queen Elizabeth, and according to Mr. Wood was buried near Skelton in the Chan|cel of St. Margaret's, We&s;tmin&s;ter. By his writ|ings, he appears a man of &s;en&s;e, and &s;ometimes a poet, tho' he does not &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s any degree of invention. His language is generally pure, and his numbers not wholly inharmonious. The Legend of Jane Shore is the mo&s;t fini&s;hed of all his works, from which I have taken a quotation. His death, according to the mo&s;t probable conjecture, happen|ed in 1570. Thus like a &s;tone (&s;ays Win&s;tanley) did he trundle about, but never gathered any mo&s;s, dying but poor, as may be &s;een by his epitaph in Mr. Camden's Remains, which runs thus:<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

<HEAD>GEORGE FERRARS,</HEAD>
<P>DE&s;cended of an ancient family &s;eated in Hert|ford&s;hire, was born there in a village not far from St. Alban's about the year 1510<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From manu&s;cript note on the art of poetry.</NOTE>. He was a lawyer, a hi&s;torian, and a poet; he received his education at the univer&s;ity of Oxford, but of what college he was Wood him&s;elf has not been able to di&s;cover; he removed from thence to Lincolns'-Inn, where, by a diligent application to the law, he made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in his profe&s;&s;ion, and by the patronage of that great mini&s;ter Cromwell Earl of E&s;&s;ex, who was him&s;elf a man of a&s;toni&s;hing abili|ties, he &s;oon made a figure at the bar. He was the menial &s;ervant of King Henry VIII.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Biog.

This grant of the King's happened in the year 1535; and yet in &s;even years afterwards, either thro' want of oeco|nomy, or by a boundle&s;s confidence in his friends, he reduced his affairs to a very indifferent &s;ituation,
<PB N="70" REF="75">
which, perhaps, might be the rea&s;on, why he pro|cured him&s;elf to be cho&s;en Member for the Borough of Plymouth in the county of Devon,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willis notitia Parliam. vol 2. p. 295.</NOTE> in the Par|liament &s;ummoned the thirty-third year of that King's reign. During the Se&s;&s;ions he had the misfortune to be arre&s;ted by an officer belonging to the Sheriffs of London, and carried to the counter, then in Bread-&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eet. No &s;ooner had the Hou&s;e of Commons got notice of this in&s;ult offered to one of their Mem|bers, than they immediately enacted a &s;ettled rule, which from that accident took place, with re&s;pect to privilege, and ever &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ce that time the Members of the Hou&s;e have been exempt from arre&s;ts for debt. His Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e re&s;ented the affront offered to his &s;ervant, and with the concurrence of the Parliament proceeded very &s;everely again&s;t the Sheriffs.</P>
<P>Hollin&s;hed in his chronicle, vol 2. p. 955, gives a very full account of it. Sir Thomas Moils, knight, then Speaker of the Hou&s;e, gave a &s;pecial order to the Serjeant of the Parliament to repair to the Comp|ter, and there demand the delivery of the pri&s;oner. But notwith&s;tanding this high authority, the officers in the city refu&s;ed to obey the command, and after many altercations, they ab&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ted the Ser|jeant, upon which a fray en&s;ued within the Comp|ter-gates, between Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s and the officers, not with|out mutual hurt, &s;o that the Serjeant was driven to defend him&s;elf with his mace of arms, and had the crown of it broken with warding off a &s;troke; the Sheriffs of London &s;o far from appea&s;ing, fomented the quarrel, and with in&s;olent language refu&s;ed to deliver their pri&s;oner: Upon which the Serjeant, thus abu&s;ed, returned to the Hou&s;e and related what had happened. This circum&s;tance &s;o exa&s;perated the Burge&s;&s;es, that they all ro&s;e and went into the Upper Hou&s;e, and declared they would tran&s;act no
<PB N="71" REF="76">
more bu&s;ine&s;s till their Member was re&s;tored to them. They then commanded their Serjeant again to go to the Compter with his mace, and make a &s;econd de|mand by their authority.&mdash;The Sheriffs hearing that the Upper Hou&s;e had concerned them&s;elves in it, and being afraid of their re&s;entment, re&s;to|red the pri&s;oner before the Serjeant had time to return to the Compter; but this did not &s;atisfy the Burge&s;&s;es, they &s;ummoned the Sheriffs before them, together with one White, who in contempt of their dignity had taken out a writ again&s;t Fer|rars, and as a puni&s;hment for their in&s;olence, they were &s;ent to the Tower; and ever &s;ince that period, the power and privilege of the Commons have been on the increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Ferrars continued in high favour with Henry during the remainder of his reign, and &s;eems to have &s;tood upon good terms with Somer&s;et Lord Protector in the beginning of Edward VI. &s;ince it appears that he attended the Protector in quality of one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Army, in his expedition into Scotland in 1548;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patten's Journal of the Scotch expedition. p. 13.</NOTE> which, perhaps, might be owing to his being about the per&s;on of Prince Edward in his father's life-time. Another in|&s;tance of this happened about four years afterwards, at a very critical juncture, for when the unfortunate Duke of Somer&s;et lay under &s;entence of death, and it was ob&s;erved that the people murmured and often gave te&s;timonies of di&s;content, and that the King him&s;elf was very unea&s;y, tho&s;e about him &s;tudied every method to quiet and amu&s;e the one, to en|tertain and divert the other<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Stow's Annal. p. 608.</NOTE>. In order to this, at the entrance of Chri&s;tmas holidays, Mr. Ferrars was proclaimed Lord Mi&s;rule, that is a kind of Prince of &s;ports and pa&s;times, which office he di&s;charged
<PB N="72" REF="77">
for twelve days together at Greenwich with great magnificence and addre&s;s, and entirely to the King's &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In this character, attended by the polite&s;t part of the Court, he made an excur&s;ion to London, where he was &s;plendidly entertained by the Lord Mayor, and when he took his leave he had pre&s;ents given him him in token of re&s;pect. But notwith&s;tanding he made &s;o great figure in the diver&s;ions at court, yet he was no idle &s;pectator of political affairs, and maintained his reputation with the learned world. He wrote the reign of Queen Mary, which tho' publi&s;hed in the name of Richard Grafton, in his chronicles; yet was certainly the performance of Ferrars, according to the annals of Stow, p. 632, who&s;e authority in this ca&s;e is very high. Our author was an hi&s;torian, a law|yer, and a politician even in his poetry, as ap|pears from the&s;e pieces of his which are in&s;erted in the Mirror of Magi&s;trates, and which are not infe|rior to any others that have found a place there<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lond. 40.</NOTE>. In the early part of his life he wrote &s;ome tracts on his own profe&s;&s;ion, which gained him great reputa|tion, and which di&s;cover that he was a lover of liberty, and not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice to the crown the rights and properties of the &s;ubject. It &s;el|dom happens that when a man often changes his &s;ituation, or is forced to do &s;o, that he continues to pre&s;erve the good opinion of different parties, but this was a happine&s;s which Ferrars enjoyed. He was con&s;ulted by the learned as a candid critic, admired and loved by all who conver&s;ed with him.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the time of our author's death, we cannot be ab&s;olutely certain; all we know is, that he died in the year 1579, at his hou&s;e in Flam&s;tead in Hertford&s;hire, and was buried in the pari&s;h church; for as Wood informs

<P>Having this occa&s;ion to mention Thomas Lord Cromwell, the famous Earl of E&s;&s;ex, who was our author's warme&s;t patron, I am per&s;uaded my readers will forgive me a digre&s;&s;ion which will open to them the noble&s;t in&s;tance of gratitude and honour in that worthy nobleman, that ever adorned the page of an hi&s;torian, and which has been told with rapture by all who have writ of the times, particularly by Dr. Burnet in his hi&s;tory of the Reformation, and Fox in his Martyrology.&mdash;Thomas Lord Cromwell was the &s;on of a Black&s;mith at Putney, and was a &s;oldier under the duke of Bourbon at the &s;acking of Rome in the year 1527. While he was abroad in a mili|tary character, in a very low &s;tation, he fell &s;ick, and was unable to follow the army; he was ob&s;erved one day by an Italian merchant to walk very pen|&s;ive, and had all the appearance of penury and wretchedne&s;s: The merchant enquired of him the place of his birth, and fortune, and upon conver&s;ing with Cromwell, was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the ac|count he gave of him&s;elf, that he &s;upplied him with money and credit to carry him to England. Crom|well afterwards made the mo&s;t rapid progre&s;s in &s;tate-preferments ever known. Honours were multiplied thick upon him, and he came to have the di&s;pen&s;ing of his &s;overeign's bounty. It hap|pened 
<PB N="74" REF="79">
that this Italian merchant's circum&s;tances de|cayed, and he came to England to &s;ollicit the pay|ment of &s;ome debts due to him by his corre&s;pondents; who finding him nece&s;&s;itous, were di&s;po&s;ed to put him off, and take the advantage of his want, to a|void payment. This not a little embarra&s;&s;ed the foreigner, who was now in a &s;ituation forlorn enough.

He immediately ordered one of his attendants to de&s;ire the merchant to come to his hou&s;e. His lord&s;hip asked the merchant whether he knew him? he an&s;wered no: Cromwell then related the circum&s;tance of the merchant's relieving a certain Engli&s;hman; and asked if he remembered it? The merchant an&s;wered, that he had always made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to do good, but did not re|member that circum&s;tance.&mdash;His lord&s;hip then en|quired the rea&s;on of his coming to England, and upon the merchant's telling him his &s;tory, he &s;o intere&s;ted him&s;elf, as &s;oon to procure the payment of all his debts.&mdash;Cromwell then informed the merchant, that he was him&s;elf the per&s;on he had thus relieved; and for every Ducat which the merchant had given him, he returned to the value of a hundred, telling him, that this was the payment of his debt. He then made him a munificent pre&s;ent, and asked him whether he cho&s;e to &s;ettle in England, or return to his own country. The foreigner cho&s;e the latter, and re|turned to &s;pend the remainder of his days in com|petence and quiet, after having experienced in lord E&s;&s;ex as high an in&s;tance of genero&s;ity and gratitude as perhaps ever was known.

<HEAD>Sir PHILIP SIDNEY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great ornament to human nature, to li|terature, and to Britain, was the &s;on of Sir Henry S dney, knight of the Garter, and three times Lord Deputy of Ireland, and of lady Mary Dudley, daughter to the duke of Northumberland, and nephew to that great favourite, Robert, earl of Leice&s;ter.</P>
<P>Oxford had the honour of his education, under the tuition of Dr. Thomas Thornton, canon of Chri&s;t Church. At the univer&s;ity he remained till he was 17 years of age, and in June 1572 &s;et out on his travels. On the 24th of Augu&s;t following, when the ma&s;&s;acre fell out at Paris, he was then there, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. &s;olio. p. 226.</NOTE> and with other Engli&s;hmen took &s;helter in Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham's hou&s;e, her Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="77" REF="82">
amba&s;&s;ador at that court. When this &s;torm &s;ub|&s;ided, he departed from Paris, went through Lor|rain, and by Stra&s;burgh and Heydelburgh, to Francfort, in September or October following; where he &s;ettled for &s;ome time, and was enter|tained, agent for the duke of Saxony. At his re|turn, her Maje&s;ty was one of the fir&s;t who di|&s;tingui&s;hed his great abilities, and, as proud of &s;o rich a trea&s;ure, &s;he &s;ent him amba&s;&s;ador to Ro|dolph the emperor, to condole him on the death of Maximilian, and al&s;o to other princes of Ger|many. The next year, 1577, he went to the court of that gallant prince Don John de Au&s;tria, Viceroy in the low countries for the king of Spain. Don John was the proude&s;t man in his time; haughty and imperious in his behaviour, and always u&s;ed the foreign amba&s;&s;adors, who came to his court, with un&s;ufferable in&s;olence and &s;uperiority: At fir&s;t he paid but little re&s;pect to Sidney on account of his youth, and &s;eeming inexperience; but having had occa&s;ion to hear him talk, and give &s;ome account of the manners of every court where he had been, he was &s;o &s;truck with his vivacity, the propriety of his ob|&s;ervations, and the lu&s;tre of his parts, that he ever afterwards u&s;ed him with familiarity, and paid him more re&s;pect in his private character, than he did to any amba&s;&s;ador &s;rom whatever court. Some years af|ter this, Wood ob&s;erves, that in a book ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">led Cabala, he &s;et forth his rea&s;ons why the mar|riage of the queen with the duke of Anjou was di&s;advantageous to the nation. This addre&s;s was written at the de&s;ire of the earl of Leice&s;ter, his uncle; upon which, a quarrel happened between him and the earl of Oxford, which perhaps oc|ca&s;ioned his retirement from court for two years, when he wrote that renowned romance called Ar|cadia. We find him again in high favour, when the treaty of marriage was renewed; he was en|gaged

with Sir Fulk Greville in tilting, for the diver&s;ion of the court; and at the departure of the duke of Anjou from England, he attended him to Antwerp<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wood, p. 227.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the 8th of January, 1582, he received the honour of knighthood from the queen; and in the beginning of the year 1585, he de&s;igned an expediti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n with Sir Francis Drake into America; but being hindered by the Queen, who thought the court would be deficient without him, he was made Governor of Flu&s;hing, (about that time de|livered to the Queen for one of the cautionary towns and General of the Hor&s;e. In both the&s;e places of important tru&s;t, his behaviour in point of prudence and valour was irreproachable, and gained additional honour to his country, e&s;peci|ally when in July 1586 he &s;urprized Axil, and pre&s;erved the lives and reputation of the Engli&s;h army, at the enterpri&s;e of Gravelin. About that time he was in election for the crown of Poland, but the queen refu&s;ed to promote this his glorious advancement, not from jealou&s;y, but from the fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> of her times. He united the &s;tate&s;|man, the &s;cholar and the &s;oldier; and as by the one, he purcha&s;ed &s;ame and honour in his life, &s;o by the other, he has acquired immortality after death.</P>
<P>In the year 1586, when that unfortunate &s;tand was made again&s;t the Spaniards before Zutphen, the 22d of September, when he was getting upon the third hor&s;e, having had two &s;lain under him be&s;ore, he was wounded with a mu&s;ket-&s;hot out of the trenches, which broke the bone of his thigh. The hor&s;e he rode upon was rather furi|ou&s;ly choleric, than bravely proud, &s;o forced him to for&s;ake the field, but not his back, as the no|ble&s;t and fitte&s;t bier (&s;ays lord Brook) to carry a martial commander to his grave. In this progre&s;s,

pa&s;&s;ing along by the re&s;t of the army where his uncle the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earl of Leice&s;ter.</NOTE> General was, and being faint with exce&s;s of bleeding, he called for drink, which was pre&s;ently brought him; but as he was putting the bottle to his mouth, he &s;aw a poor &s;oldier carried along, who had been wounded at the &s;ame time, wi&s;hfully ca&s;t up his eyes at the bottle; whereupon Sir Philip took it from his own mouth before he drank, and delivered it to the poor man, with the&s;e words, <Q REND="inline">"thy nece&s;&s;ity is yet greater than mine;"</Q> and when he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted this poor &s;oldier and &s;ellow &s;ufferer, as he called him, he was pre&s;ently carried to Arnheim, where the principal &s;urgeons of the camp attended him.</P>
<P>This generous behaviour of our gallant knight, ought not to pa&s;s without a panegyric. All his deeds o&s; bravery, his politene&s;s, his learning, and courtly accompli&s;hments, do not reflect &s;o much honour up|on him, as this one di&s;intere&s;ted, truly heroic action: It di&s;covered &s;o tender and benevolent a nature; a mind &s;o fortified again&s;t pain; a heart &s;o overflow|ing with generous &s;entiments, to relieve, in oppo|&s;ition to the violent call of his own nece&s;&s;ities, a poor man langui&s;hing in the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s, be|fore him&s;elf, that as none can read it without the highe&s;t admiration of the wounded hero, &s;o none I hope will think me extravagant in thus en|deavouring to extol it. Bravery is often con&s;titu|tional; fame may be the motive to feats of arms, a &s;tate&s;man and a courtier may act from intere&s;t; but a &s;acrifice &s;o generous as this, can be made by none but tho&s;e who are good as well as great, who are noble-minded, and gloriou&s;ly compa&s;&s;ionate, like Sidney.</P>
<P>When the &s;urgeons began to dre&s;s his wound, he told them, that while his &s;trength was yet en|tire,
<PB N="80" REF="85">
his body free from a fever, and his mind a|ble to endure, they might freely u&s;e their art, cut and &s;earch to the bottom; but if they &s;hould ne|glect their art, and renew torments in the decli|nation of nature, their ignorance, or over-tender|ne's would prove a kind of tyranny to their friend, and reflect no honour upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For &s;ometime they had great hopes of his recovery; and &s;o zealous were they to promote it, and overjoy|ed at its &s;eeming approach, that they &s;pread the re|port of it, which &s;oon reached London, and di&s;|fa&s;ed the mo&s;t general joy at Court that ever was known.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time count Hollock was under the care of a mo&s;t excellent &s;urgeon, for a wound in his threat by a mu&s;ket &s;hot; yet he neglected his own extremity to &s;ave his friend, and for that purpo&s;e &s;ent him to Sir Philip. This &s;urgeon not|with&s;tanding, ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of love to his ma&s;ter, returning one day to dre&s;s his wound, the count chearfully a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ked him how Sir Philip did? he an&s;wered with a dejected look, that he was not well: At the&s;e words the count, as having more &s;en&s;e of his friend's wound than his own, cried out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Away villain, never &s;ee my face again till you bring better news of that gentleman's recovery, for who&s;e redemption, many &s;uch as I were happily lo&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Finding all the efforts of the &s;urgeons in vain, he began to put no more confidence in their &s;kill, and re&s;igned him&s;elf with heroic patience to his fate. He called the mini&s;ters to him, who were all excellent men of different nations, and before them made &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tian faith, as no book, but the heart, can truly and feelingly deliver. Then calling for his will, and &s;ettling his temporal affairs, the la&s;t &s;cene of this tragedy, was the parting between the two brothers. Sir Philip exerted all his &s;oul in endeavouring to &s;up|pre&s;s his &s;orrow, in which affection and nature
<PB N="81" REF="86">
were too powerful for him, while the other de|mon&s;trated his tenderne&s;s by immoderate tran&s;ports of grief, a weakne&s;s which every tender brea&s;t will ea&s;ily forgive, who have ever felt the pangs of parting from a brother; and a brother of Sir Philip Sidney's worth, demanded &s;till additional &s;orrow. He took his leave with the&s;e admoni&s;h|ing words, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear, much loved, honoured brother, love my memory; cheri&s;h my friends; their faith to me may a&s;&s;ure you they are h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|ne&s;t. But above all, govern your will and af|fections, by the will and word of your Creator. In me, beholding the end of this world with all her vanities."</Q> And with this farewel he de&s;ired the company to lead him away.</P>
<P>After his death, which happened on the 16th of October, the States of Zealand became &s;ui|tors to his Maje&s;ty, and his noble friends, that they might have the honour of burying his body at the public expence of their government, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Brook's life.</NOTE> but in this they were denied; for &s;oon after, his body was brought to Flu&s;hing, and being embarked with great &s;olemnity on the 1st of November, landed at Tower Wharf on the 6th of the &s;ame month; and the 16th of February following, after having lain in &s;tate, it was magnificently depo&s;ited in St. Paul's Cathedral.</P>
<P>As the funeral of many princes has not exceed|ed it in &s;olemnity, &s;o few have equalled it in the undi&s;&s;embled &s;orrow for his lo&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For a great many months after his death, it was reckoned indecent in any gentleman to appear &s;plendidly dre&s;s'd; the public mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ned him, not with exterior formality, but with the genuine &s;orrow of the heart.

<P>He left behind him one child named Elizabeth, (married to the earl of Rutland) whom he had by Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham's daughter, and who un|fortunately died without i&s;&s;ue to perpetuate the living virtues of her illu&s;trious family. She is &s;aid to have been exce&s;&s;ively beautiful; that &s;he mar|ried the earl of Rutland by authority, but that her affections were dedicated to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and as Queen Elizabeth was in love with that no|bleman, &s;he became very jealous of this charming counte&s;s.

<P>Of all his works his Arcadia is the mo&s;t cele|brated; it is dedicated to his &s;i&s;ter the counte&s;s of Pembroke, who was a Lady of as fine a character, and as equally fini&s;hed in every female accompli&s;h|ment, as her brother in the manly. She lived to a good old age, and died in 1621. Ben John&s;on has wrote an epitaph upon her, &s;o inimitably ex|cellent, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the temptation of in|&s;erting it here.

but Marloe came to a very untimely end, as &s;ome remarked, in con&s;equence of his execrable bla&s;phe|mies.

<P>RECEIVED his education at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and was, as Win&s;tanley &s;ays, a great friend to the printers by the many books he writ. He was a merry droll in tho&s;e times, and a man &s;o addicted to plea&s;ure, that as Win&s;tanley ob&s;erves, he drank much deeper draughts of &s;ack, than of the Heliconian &s;tream; he was among&s;t the fir&s;t of our poets who writ for bread,
<PB N="88" REF="93">
and in order the better to &s;upport him&s;elf, tho' he lived in an age far from being di&s;&s;olute, viz. in that of the renowned Queen Elizabeth; yet he had recour&s;e to the mean expedient of writing ob&s;ceni|ty, and favouring the cau&s;e of vice, by which he no doubt recommended him&s;elf to the rakes about town, who, as they are generally no true judges of wit, &s;o e&s;timate the merit of a piece, as it happens to &s;uit their appetite, or encourage them in every irregular indulgence. No man of honour who &s;ees a poet endowed with a large &s;hare of natural under&s;tanding, pro&s;tituting his pen to the vile&s;t purpo&s;e of debauchery and lewdne&s;s, can think of him but with contempt; and his wit, however brilliant, ought not to &s;creen him from the ju&s;t indignation of the &s;ober part of man|kind. When wit is pro&s;tituted to vice, 'tis wit no more; that is, it cea&s;es to be true wit; and I have often thought there &s;hould be &s;ome pub|lic mark of infamy fixed on tho&s;e who hurt &s;ociety by loo&s;e writings. But Mr. Green mu&s;t be freed from the imputation of hypocri&s;y, for we find him practi&s;ing the very doctrines he taught. Win&s;tanley relates that he was married to a very fine and de&s;erving lady, whom he ba&s;ely for&s;ook, with a child &s;he had by him, for the company of &s;ome harlots, to whom he applied the wages of iniquity, while his wife &s;tarved. Af|ter &s;ome years indulgence of this &s;ort, when his wit began to grow &s;tale, we find him fallen into ab|ject poverty, and lamenting the life he had led which brought him to it; for it always happens, that a mi&s;tre&s;s is a more expen&s;ive piece of furni|niture than a wife; and if the modern adulterers would &s;peak the truth, I am certain they would acknowledge, that half the money which, in the true &s;en&s;e of the word, is mi&s;pent upon tho&s;e daugh|ters of de&s;truction, would keep a family with de|cency, and maintain a wife with honour. When our author was in this forlorn mi&s;erable &s;tate, he
<PB N="89" REF="94">
writ a letter to his wife, which Mr. Win&s;tanly has pre&s;erved, and which, as it has &s;omewhat tender in it I &s;hall in&s;ert. It has often been ob&s;erved, that half the unhappy marriages in the world, are more owing to the men than the women: That women are in general much better beings, in the moral &s;en&s;e, than the men; who, as they bu&s;tle le&s;s in life, are generally unacquainted with tho&s;e artifices and tricks, which are acquired by a knowledge of the world; and that then their yoke|fellows need only be tender and indulgent, to win them. But I believe it may be generally allowed, that women are the be&s;t or wor&s;t part of the human creation: none excel them in virtue; but when they depart from it, none exceed them in vice. In the ca&s;e of Green, we &s;hall &s;ee by the letter he &s;ent his wife how much &s;he was injured.</P>

<HEAD>EDMUND SPENSER</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in London, and educated at Pem|broke Hall in Cambridge. The accounts of the birth and family of this great man are but ob&s;cure and imper&s;ect, and at his fir&s;t &s;etting out into life, his fortune and intere&s;t &s;eem to have been very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>After he had for &s;ome time continued at the college, and laid that foundation of learning, which, joined to his natural genius, qualified him to ri&s;e to &s;o great an excellency, he &s;tood for a fellow|&s;hip, in competition with Mr. Andrews, a gentle|man in holy orders, and afterwards lord bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in which he was un&s;ucce&s;sful. This di&s;appointment, joined with the narrowne&s;s of his circum&s;tances, forced him to quit the univer&s;ity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hughes's Life of Spen&s;er, prefixed to the edition of our au+thor's works.</NOTE>; and we find him next re&s;iding at the hou&s;e of a friend in the North, where he fell in love with his
<PB N="92" REF="97">
Ro&s;alind, whom he finely celebrates in his pa&s;to|ral poems, and of who&s;e cruelty he has written &s;uch pathetical complaints.</P>
<P>It is probable that about this time Spen&s;er's ge|nius began fir&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf; for the Shep|herd's Calendar, which is &s;o full of his unpro&s;pe|rous pa&s;&s;ion for Ro&s;alind, was among&s;t the fir&s;t of his works of note, and the &s;uppo&s;ition is &s;trength|ened, by the con&s;ideration of Poetry's being fre|quently the offspring of love and retirement. This work he addre&s;&s;ed by a &s;hort dedication to the Maecenas of his age, the immortal Sir Philip Sid|ney. This gentleman was now in the highe&s;t re|putation, both for wit and gallantry, and the mo&s;t popular of all the courtiers of his age, and as he was him&s;elf a writer, and e&s;pecially excelled in the fabulous or inventive part of poetry; it is no wonder he was &s;truck with our author's genius, and became &s;en&s;ible of his merit. A &s;tory is told of him by Mr. Hughes, which I &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader, as it &s;erves to illu&s;trate the great worth and penetration of Sidney, as well as the excellent genius of Spen&s;er. It is &s;aid that our poet was a &s;tranger to this gentleman, when he began to write his Pairy Queen, and that he took occa&s;ion to go to Leice&s;ter-hou&s;e, and introduce him&s;elf by &s;ending in to Mr. Sidney a copy of the ninth Canto of the fir&s;t book of that poem. Sidney was much &s;urprized with the de&s;cription of de&s;pair in that Canto, and is &s;aid to have &s;hewn an unu&s;ual kind of tran&s;port on the di&s;covery of &s;o new and uncommon a genius. After he had read &s;ome &s;tanza's, he turned to his &s;teward, and bid him give the per&s;on that brought tho&s;e ver&s;es fifty pounds; but upon reading the next &s;tanza, he or|dered the &s;um to be doubled. The &s;teward was no le&s;s &s;urprized than his ma&s;ter, and thought it his duty to make &s;ome delay in executing &s;o &s;ud|den and lavi&s;h a bounty; but upon reading one
<PB N="93" REF="98">
&s;tanza more, Mr. Sidney rai&s;ed the gratuity to two hundred pounds, and commanded the &s;teward to give it immediately, le&s;t as he read further he might be tempted to give away his whole e&s;tate. From this time he admitted the author to his acquain|tance and conver&s;ation, and prepared the way for his being known and received at court.</P>
<P>Tho' this &s;eemed a promi&s;ing omen, to be thus in|troduced to court, yet he did not in&s;tantly reap any advantage from it. He was indeed created poet lau|reat to Queen Elizabeth, but he for &s;ome time wore a barren laurel, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the place with|out the pen&s;ion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hughes ubi &s;upra,</NOTE>. Lord trea&s;urer Burleigh, under who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure Spen&s;er laboured, took care to intercept the Queen's favours to this unhappy great man. As misfortunes have the mo&s;t influence on elegant and poli&s;hed minds, &s;o it was no wonder that Spen&s;er was much depre&s;&s;ed by the cold recep|tion he met with from the great; a circum&s;tance which not a little detracts from the merit of the mini&s;ters then in power: for I know not if all the political tran&s;actions of Burleigh, are &s;ufficient to counterballance the infamy affixed on his name, by pro&s;ecuting re&s;entment again&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed merit, and keeping him who was the ornament of the times, as much di&s;tant as po&s;&s;ible from the ap|proach of competence. These di&s;couragements greatly &s;unk our author's &s;pirit, and accordingly we find him pouring out his heart, in complaints of &s;o injurious and unde&s;erved a treatment; which probably, would have been le&s;s unfortu|nate to him, if his noble patron Sir Philip Sidney had not been &s;o much ab&s;ent from court, as by his employments abroad, and the &s;hare he had in the Low-Country wars, he was obliged to be. In a poem called, The Ruins of Time, which was written &s;ome time after Sidney's death, the au|thor
<PB N="94" REF="99">
&s;eems to allude to the di&s;couragement I have mentioned in the following &s;tanza.<Q><L>O grief of griefs, O gall of all good hearts!</L>
<L>To &s;ee that virtue &s;hould de&s;pi&s;ed be,</L>
<L>Of &s;uch as fir&s;t were rai&s;ed for virtue's parts,</L>
<L>And now broad-&s;preading like an aged tree,</L>
<L>Let none &s;hoot up that nigh them planted be;</L>
<L>O let not the&s;e, of whom the mu&s;e is &s;corned,</L>
<L>Alive or dead be by the mu&s;e adorned.</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e lines are certainly meant to reflect on Bur|leigh for neglecting him, and the Lord Trea&s;urer afterwards conceived a hatred towards him for the &s;atire he apprehended was levelled at him in Mo|ther Hubbard's Tale. In this poem, the author has in the mo&s;t lively manner, painted out the misfor|tune of depending on court favours. The lines which follow are among others very remarkable.<Q><L>Full little knowe&s;t thou, that ha&s;t not try'd,</L>
<L>What Hell it is in &s;uing long to bide,</L>
<L>To clo&s;e good days, that nights be better &s;pent,</L>
<L>To wa&s;te long nights in pen&s;ive di&s;content;</L>
<L>To &s;peed to day, to be put back to-morrow,</L>
<L>To feed on hope, to pine with fear and &s;orrow</L>
<L>To have thy prince's grace, yet want her peers,</L>
<L>To have thy asking, yet wait many years.</L>
<L>To fret thy &s;oul with cro&s;&s;es, and with care.</L>
<L>To eat thy heart, thro' comfortle&s;s de&s;pair;</L>
<L>To fawn, to crouch, to wait, to ride, to run</L>
<L>To &s;pend, to give, to want, to be undone.</L></Q></P>
<P>As this was very much the author's ca&s;e, it pro|bably was the particular pa&s;&s;age in that poem which gave offence; for as Hughes very elegantly ob&s;erves, even the &s;ighs of a mi&s;erable man, are &s;ometimes re|&s;ented as an affront, by him who is the occa&s;ion of them. There is a little &s;tory, which &s;eems founded
<PB N="95" REF="100">
on the grievance ju&s;t now mentioned, and is related by &s;ome as a matter of fact <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Win&s;t. p. 88.</NOTE> commonly reported at that time. It is &s;aid, that upon his pre&s;enting &s;ome poems to the Queen, &s;he ordered him a gratuity of one hundred pounds, but the Lord Trea&s;urer Bur|leigh objecting to it, &s;aid with &s;ome &s;corn of the poet, of who&s;e merit he was totally ignorant, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What, all this for a &s;ong?"</Q> The queen replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Then give him what is rea&s;on."</Q> Spen&s;er for &s;ome time waited, but had the mortification to find him&s;elf di&s;appointed of her Maje&s;ty's bounty. Upon this he took a proper opportunity to pre&s;ent a paper to Queen Elizabeth in the manner of a pe|tition, in which he reminded her of the order &s;he had given, in the following lines.<Q><L>I was promi&s;ed on a time</L>
<L>To have rea&s;on for my rhime,</L>
<L>From that time, unto this &s;ea&s;on</L>
<L>I received nor rhime, nor rea&s;on.</L></Q></P>
<P>This paper produced the intended effect, and the Queen, after &s;harply reproving the trea&s;urer, imme|diately directed the payment of the hundred pounds &s;he had fir&s;t ordered. In the year 1579 he was &s;ent abroad by the Earl of Leice&s;ter, as appears by a copy of Latin ver&s;es dated from Leice&s;ter|hou&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ed to his friend Mr. Harvey; but Mr. Hughes has not been able to determine in what &s;ervice we was employed. When the Lord Grey of Wilton was cho&s;en Deputy of Ireland, Spen&s;er was recommended to him as &s;ecretary. This drew him over to another kingdom, and &s;ettled him in a &s;cene of life very different from what he had formerly known; but, that he under&s;tood, and di&s;|charged his employment with skill and capacity, ap|pears &s;ufficiently by his di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;tate of
<PB N="96" REF="101">
Ireland, in which there are many &s;olid and judicious remarks, that &s;hew him no le&s;s qualified for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;tate, than for the entertainment of the mu&s;es. His life was now freed from the difficul|ties under which it had hitherto &s;truggled, and his &s;ervices to the Crown received a reward of a grant from Queen Elizabeth of 3000 Acres of land in the county of Cork. His hou&s;e was in Kilcolman, and the river Mulla, which he has more than once &s;o finely introduced in his poems, ran through his grounds. Much about this time, he contracted an intimate friend&s;hip with the great and learned Sir Walter Raleigh, who was then a captain under the lord Grey. The poem of Spen&s;er's, called Colin Clouts come home again, in which Sir Walter Raleigh is de&s;cribed under the name of the Shepherd of the Ocean, is a beautiful memorial of this friend&s;hip, which took its ri&s;e from a &s;imilarity of ta&s;te in the polite arts, and which he agreeably de&s;cribes with a &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy peculiar to him. Sir Wal|ter afterwards promoted him in Queen Elizabeth's e&s;teem, thro' who&s;e recommendation &s;he read his writings. He now fell in love a &s;econd time with a merchant's daughter, in which, &s;ays Mrs. Cooper, author of the mu&s;es library, he was more &s;ucce&s;sful than in his fir&s;t amour. He wrote upon this occa&s;ion a beautiful epithala|mium, with which he pre&s;ented the lady on the bridal-day, and has con&s;igned that day, and her, to immortality. In this plea&s;ant ea&s;y &s;ituation our excellent poet fini&s;hed the celebrated poem of The Fairy Queen, which was begun and conti|nued at different intervals of time, and of which he at fir&s;t publi&s;hed only the three fir&s;t books; to the&s;e were added three more in a following edition, but the &s;ix la&s;t books (excepting the two canto's of mu|tability) were unfortunately lo&s;t by his &s;ervant whom he had in ha&s;te &s;ent before him into England; for tho' he pa&s;&s;ed his life for &s;ome time very &s;e|renely
<PB N="97" REF="102">
here, yet a train of misfortunes &s;till pur|&s;ued him, and in the rebellion of the Earl of De&s;mond he was plundered and deprived of his e&s;tate. This di&s;tre&s;s forced him to return to Eng|land, where for want of his noble patron Sir Philip Sidney, he was plunged into new calami|ties, as that gallant Hero died of the wounds he received at Zutphen. It is &s;aid by Mr Hughes, that Spen&s;er &s;urvived his patron about twelve years, and died the &s;ame year with his powerf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">l ene|my the Lord Burleigh, 1598.

Several copies of ver&s;es were thrown after him into his grave, and his monument was erected at the charge of the famous Robert Devereux, the un|fortunate Earl of E&s;&s;ex. This is the account gi|ven by his editor, of the death of Spen&s;er, but there is &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that he &s;poke only upon imagination, as he has produced no authority to &s;upport his opinion, e&s;pecially as I find in a book of great reputation, another opinion, delivered upon probable grounds. The ingenious Mr. Drummond of Hawthronden, a noble wit of Scotland, had an intimate corre&s;pondence with all the genius's of his time who re&s;ided at London, particularly the famous Ben John&s;on, who had &s;o high an opinion of Mr. Drummond's abilities, that he took a journey into Scotland in order to conver&s;e with him, and &s;tayed &s;ome time at his hou&s;e at Hawthronden. After Ben John&s;on departed, Mr. Drummond, careful to retain what pa&s;t betwixt them, wrote down the heads of their conver&s;ation; which is publi&s;hed among&s;t his poems and hi&s;tory of the five James's Kings of Scotland. Among&s;t other particulars there is this. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ben John|&s;on told me that Spen&s;er's goods were robbed

<P>Mr. Drummond's works, from whence I have ex|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">acted the above, are printed in a thin quarto, and may be &s;een at Mr. Wil&s;on's at Plato's-Head in the Strand. I have been thus particular in the quota|tion, that no one may &s;u&s;pect &s;uch extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances to be advanced upon imagination. In the in&s;cription on his tomb in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, it is &s;aid he was born in the year 1510, and died 1596; Cambden &s;ays 1598, but in regard to his birth they mu&s;t both be mi&s;taken, for it is by no means probable he was born &s;o early as 1510, if we judge by the remarkable circum&s;tance of his &s;tanding for a fellow&s;hip in competition with Mr. Andrews, who was not born according to Hughes till 1555. Be&s;ides, if this account of his birth be true, he mu&s;t have been &s;ixty years old when he fir&s;t publi&s;hed his Shepherd's Calendar, an age not very proper for love; and in this ca&s;e it is no wonder, that the beautiful Ro&s;alind &s;lighted his addre&s;&s;es; and he mu&s;t have been &s;eventy years old when he entered into bu&s;ine&s;s under lord Grey, who was created deputy in Ireland 1580: for which rea&s;ons we may fairly conclude, that the in&s;crip|tion is fal&s;e, either by the error of the carver, or perhaps it was put on when the monument was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">aired.</P>

It is agreed on all hands, that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our author helped to &s;horten his days, and indeed, when his extraordinary merit is con&s;idered, he had the harde&s;t mea&s;ure of any of our poets. It appears from different accounts, that he was of an amiable &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, humane and generous in his na|ture. Be&s;ides the Fairy Queen, we find he had written &s;everal other pieces, of which we can on|ly trace out the titles. Among the&s;e, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable were nine comedies, in imitation of the comedies of his admired Ario&s;to, in&s;cribed with the names of the Nine Mu&s;es. The re&s;t which are mentioned in his letters, and tho&s;e of his friends, are his Dying Pelicane, his Pageants, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">emmata Dudleyana, the Canticles paraphrazed, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, Seven P&s;alms, Hours of our Lord, Sacrifice of a Sinner, Purgatory, a S'ennight Slum|ber, the Court of Cupid, and Hell of Lovers. It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, he had written a treati&s;e in pro&s;e called the Engli&s;h Poet: as for the Epitha|lamion Thame&s;is, and his Dreams, both mentioned by him&s;elf in one of his letters, Mr. Hughes thinks they are &s;till pre&s;erved, tho' under diffe|rent names. It appears from what is &s;aid of the Dreams by his friend Mr. Harvey, that they were in imitation of Petrarch's Vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>To produce authorities in favour of Spen&s;er, as a poet, I &s;hould reckon an affront to his memory; that is a tribute which I &s;hall only pay to inferior wits, who&s;e highe&s;t honour it is to be mentioned with re|&s;pect, by genius's of a &s;uperior cla&s;s.

Sir William Temple in his e&s;&s;ay on poetry, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the religion of the Gentiles had been woven into the contexture of all the ancient poetry with an agreeable mixture, which made the moderns affect to give that of chri&s;tianity a place al&s;o in their poems; but the true religion was not found to become fictitious &s;o well as the fal&s;e one had done, and all their attempts of this kind &s;eemed rather to deba&s;e religion than heighten poetry. Spen&s;er endeavoured to &s;upply this with morality, and to make in&s;truction, in&s;tead of &s;tory the &s;ub|ject of an epic poem. His execution was excel|lent, and his flights of fancy very noble and high. But his de&s;ign was poor; and his moral lay &s;o bare, that it lo&s;t the effect.

Mr. Dryden in his dedication of Juvenal, thus proceeds: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Engli&s;h have only to boa&s;t of Spen&s;er and Milton in heroic poetry, who neither of them wanted either genius or learning to have been perfect poets, and yet both of them are liable to many cen&s;ures; for there is no uniformity in the de&s;ign of Spen&s;er: he aims at the accom|pli&s;hment

of no one action; he rai&s;es up a he|ro for every one of his adventures, and endows each of them with &s;ome particular moral vir|tue, which renders them all equal, without &s;ub|ordination or preference: Every one is valiant in his own legend; only we mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that magnanimity, which is the character of prince Arthur, &s;hines through|out the whole poem, and &s;uccours the re&s;t when they are in di&s;tre&s;s. The original of every knight was then living in the court of Queen Elizabeth; and he attributed to each of them that virtue which he thought was mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous in them; an ingenious piece of flattery, tho' it turned not much to his account.

&s;ome remarks on allegorical poetry in general, defining allegory to be a fable or &s;tory, in which, under imaginary per&s;ons or things, is &s;hadowed &s;ome real action or in&s;tructive moral, or as I think, &s;ays he, it is &s;omewhere very &s;hortly defined by Plutarch; it is that, in which one thing is related, and another thing under&s;tood; it is a kind of poe|tical picture, or hieroglyphick, which by its apt re|&s;emblance, conveys in&s;truction to the mind, by an analogy to the &s;en&s;es, and &s;o amu&s;es the fancy while it informs the under&s;tanding. Every allegory has therefore two &s;en&s;es, the literal and my&s;tical, the literal &s;en&s;e is like a dream or vi&s;ion, of which the my&s;tical &s;en&s;e is the true meaning, or inter|pretation. This will be more clearly apprehend|ed by con&s;idering. that as a &s;imile is a more ex|tended metaphor, &s;o an allegory is a kind of con|tinued &s;imile, or an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;imilitudes drawn out at full length.</P>
<P>The chief merit of this poem, no doubt, con|&s;i&s;ts in that &s;urpri&s;ing vein of fabulous invention, which runs through it, and enriches it every where with imagery and de&s;criptions, more than we meet with in any other modern poem. The author &s;eems to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a kind of poetical magic, and the figures he calls up to our view ri&s;e &s;o thick upon us, that we are at once plea&s;ed and di&s;tracted with the exhau&s;tle&s;s variety of them; &s;o that his faults may in a manner be imputed to his excellencies. His abundance be|trays him into exce&s;s, and his judgment is over|born, by the torrent of his imagination. That which &s;eems the mo&s;t liable to exception in this work is the model of it, and the choice the au|thor has made of &s;o romantic a &s;tory. The &s;e|veral books rather appear like &s;o many &s;everal poems, than one entire fable. Each of them has its pe|culiar knight, and is independent of the re&s;t; and tho' &s;ome of the per&s;ons make their appearance in different books, yet this has very little effect
<PB N="106" REF="111">
in concealing them. Prince Arthur is indeed the principal per&s;on, and has therefore a &s;hare given him in every legend; but his part is not con&s;idera|ble enough in any one of them. He appears and vani&s;hes again like a &s;pirit, and we lo&s;e &s;ight of him too &s;oon to con&s;ider him as the hero of the poem. The&s;e are the mo&s;t obvious defects in the fable of the Fairy Queen. The want of unity in the &s;tory makes it difficult for the reader to carry it in his mind, and di&s;tracts too much his attention to the &s;everal parts of it; and indeed the whole frame of it would appear mon&s;trous, were it to be examined by the rules of epic poetry, as they have been drawn from the practice of Homer and Virgil; but as it is plain, the author never de&s;igned it by the&s;e rules, I think it ought rather to be called a poem of a particular kind, de&s;crib|ing in a &s;eries of allegorical adventures, or epi|&s;odes, the mo&s;t noted virtues and vices. To com|pare it therefore with the models of antiquity, would be like drawing a parallel between the Roman and Gothic architecture. In the fir&s;t, there is doubtle&s;s a more natural grandeur and &s;implicity; in the latter, we find great mixtures of beauty and barbari&s;m, yet a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the in|vention of a variety of inferior ornaments; and tho' the former is more maje&s;tic in the whole, the latter may be very &s;urprizing and agreeable in its parts.</P>

<HEAD>Sir THOMAS OVERBURY</HEAD>
<P>WAS &s;on of Nicholas Overbury, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Bur|ton in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, one of the Judges of the Marches<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wood Athen. Oxon.</NOTE>. He was born with very bright parts, and gave early di&s;coveries of a ri&s;ing genius. In 1595, the 14th year of his age, he became a gentle|man commoner in Queen's-College in Oxford, and in 1598, as a '&s;quire's &s;on, he took the degree of batchelor of arts; he removed from thence to the Middle-Temple, in order to &s;tudy the municipal law, but did not long remain there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Win&s;t. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. His genius, which was of a &s;prightly kind, could not bear the con&s;inement of a &s;tudent, or the drudgery of read|ing law; he abandoned it therefore, and travelled into France, where he &s;o improved him&s;elf in po|lite accompli&s;hments, that when he returned he was looked upon as one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed gentlemen about court.</P>
<P>Soon after his arrival in England, he contract|ed an intimacy, which afterwards grew into friend|&s;hip with Sir Robert Carre, a Scotch gentleman, a favourite with king James, and afterwards earl of Somer&s;et. Such was the warmth of friend&s;hip in which the&s;e two gentlemen lived, that they were in&s;eparable. Carre could enter into no &s;cheme, nor pur&s;ue any mea&s;ures, without the advice and concurrence of Overbury, nor could Overbury en|joy any felicity but in the company of him he
<PB N="114" REF="119">
loved; their friend&s;hip was the &s;ubject of court-conver&s;ation, and their genius &s;eemed &s;o much alike, that it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e no breach could ever be produced between them; but &s;uch it &s;eems is the power of woman, &s;uch the influ|ence of beauty, that even the &s;acred ties of friend&s;hip are broke a&s;under by the magic ener|gy of the&s;e &s;uperior charms. Carre fell in love with lady Frances Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suf|folk, and lately divorced from the Earl of E&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Win&s;t. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. He communicated his pa&s;&s;ion to his friend, who was too penetrating not to know that no man could live with much com&s;ort, with a woman of the Counte&s;s's &s;tamp, of who&s;e morals he had a bad opinion; he in&s;inuated to Carre &s;ome &s;u&s;picions, and tho&s;e well founded, again&s;t her honour; he di&s;&s;uaded him with all the warmth of the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip, to de&s;i&s;t from a match that would in|volve him in mi&s;ery, and not to &s;uffer his pa&s;&s;ion for her beauty to have &s;o much &s;way over him, as to make him &s;acrifice his peace to its indul|gence.</P>
<P>Carre, who was de&s;perately in love, for|getting the ties of honour as well as friend&s;hip, communicated to the lady, what Overbury had &s;aid of her, and they who have read the heart of wo|man, will be at no lo&s;s to conceive what recep|tion &s;he gave that unwelcome report. She knew, that Carre was immoderately attached to Overbury, that he was directed by his Council in all things, and devoted to his intere&s;t.</P>
<Q><L>Earth has no cur&s;e like love to hatred turn'd,</L>
<L>Nor Hell a fury like a woman &s;corn'd,</L></Q>
<P>This was literally verified in the ca&s;e of the coun|te&s;s; &s;he let loo&s;e all the rage of which &s;he was capable again&s;t him, and as &s;he panted for the con|&s;ummation of the match between Carre and her, <PB N="115" REF="120">
&s;he &s;o influenced the Vi&s;count, that he began to conceive a hatred likewi&s;e to Overbury; and while he was thus &s;ubdued by the charms of a wicked woman, he &s;eemed to change his nature, and from the gentle, ea&s;y, acce&s;&s;ible, good-natured man he formerly appeared, he degenerated into the &s;ullen, vindictive, and implacable. One thing with re&s;pect to the counte&s;s ought not to be omitted. She was wife of the famous Earl of E&s;&s;ex, who afterwards headed the army of the parliament again&s;t the King, and to whom the imputation of impotence was laid. The Counte&s;s, in order to procure a divorce from her husband, gave it out that tho' &s;he had been for &s;ome time in a married &s;tate, &s;he was yet a virgin, and which it &s;eems &s;at ve|ry unea&s;y upon her. To prove this, a jury of matrons were to examine her and give their opinion, whether &s;he was, or was not a Virgin: This &s;crutiny the Counte&s;s did not care to undergo, and therefore entreated the favour that &s;he might enter masked to &s;ave her blu&s;hes; this was granted her, and &s;he took care to have a young Lady pro|vided, of much the &s;ame &s;ize and exterior appear|ance, who per&s;onated her, and the jury a&s;&s;erted her to be an unviolated Virgin. This precaution in the Counte&s;s, no doubt, dimini&s;hes her character, and is a circum&s;tance not favourable to her ho|nour; for if her husband had been really impo|tent as &s;he pretended, &s;he needed not have been afraid of the &s;earch; and it proves that &s;he ei|ther injured her husband, by fal&s;ely a&s;per&s;ing him, or that &s;he had violated her honour with other men. But which ever of the&s;e cau&s;es pre|vailed, had the Counte&s;s been wi&s;e enough, &s;he had no occa&s;ion to fear the con&s;equences of a &s;crutiny; for if I am rightly informed, a jury of old women can no more judge accurately whe|ther a woman has yielded her virginity, than they can by examining a dead body, know
<PB N="116" REF="121">
of what di&s;temper the decea&s;ed died; but be that as it may, the whole affair is unfavourable to her mode&s;ty; it &s;hews her a woman of irregular pa&s;|&s;ions, which poor Sir Thomas Overbury dear|ly experienced; for even after the Counte&s;s was happy in the embraces of the Earl of Somer&s;et, &s;he could not forbear the per&s;ecution of him; &s;he procured that Sir Thomas &s;hould be no|minated by the King to go amba&s;&s;ador to Ru&s;&s;ia, a de&s;tination &s;he knew would di&s;plea&s;e him, it being then no better than a kind of honourable grave; &s;he likewi&s;e excited Earl Somer&s;et to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">em again his friend, and to advi&s;e him &s;trongly to refu&s;e the em|ba&s;&s;y, and at the &s;ame time in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inuate, that if he &s;hould, it would only be lying a few weeks in the Tower, which to a man well provided in all the nece&s;&s;aries, as well as comforts of Life, had no great terror in it. This expedient Sir Thomas embraced, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go abroad; upon which, on the twenty-fir&s;t of April 1613, he was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower, and put under the care of Sir Gervis Yelvis, then lord lieutenant. The Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">te&s;s being &s;o far &s;ucce&s;sful, began now to conceive great hopes of compleating her &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and drew over the Earl of Somer&s;et her husband, to her party, and he who a few years before, had obtained the honour of knighthood for Overbury, was now &s;o enraged again&s;t him, that he coincided in taking mea&s;ures to murder his friend. Sir Gervis Yelvis, who obtained the lieutenancy by Somer&s;et's intere&s;t, was a creature devoted to his plea&s;ure. He was a needy man, totally de&s;titute of any principles of honour, and was ea&s;ily pre|vailed upon to forward a &s;cheme for de&s;troying poor Overbury by poi&s;on. Accordingly they con&s;ulted with one Mrs. Turner, the fir&s;t inventer (&s;ays Win|&s;tanley of that horrid garb of yellow ruffs and cuffs, and in which garb &s;he was afterwards hanged) who having acquaintance with one James Franklin, a
<PB N="117" REF="122">
man who it &s;eems was admirably fitted to be a Cut-throat, agreed with him to provide that which would not kill pre&s;ently, but cau&s;e one to lan|gui&s;h away by degrees. The lieutenant being engaged in the con&s;piracy, admits one We&s;ton, Mrs. Turner's man, who under pretence of waiting on Sir Thomas, was to do the horrid deed. The plot being thus formed, and &s;uc|ce&s;s promi&s;ing &s;o fair, Franklin buys various poi|&s;ons, White Ar&s;enick, Mercury-Sublimate, Can|tharides, Red-Mercury, with three or four other deadly ingredients, which he delivered to We&s;ton, with in&s;tructions how to u&s;e them; who put them in|to his broth and meat, increa&s;ing and dimini&s;hing their &s;trength according as he &s;aw him affected; be&s;ides the&s;e, the Counte&s;s &s;ent him by way of pre&s;ent, poi&s;oned tarts and jellies: but Overbury being of a &s;trong con&s;titution, held long out again&s;t their influence: his body broke out in blotches and blains, which occa&s;ioned the report indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly propagated by Somer&s;et, of his having died of the French Di&s;ea&s;e. At la&s;t they produced his death by the application of a poi&s;oned cly&s;ter, by which he next day in painful agonies expired. Thus (&s;ays Win&s;tanley) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by the malice of a woman that worthy Knight was murthered, who yet &s;till lives in that witty poem of his, entitled, A Wife, as is well expre&s;&s;ed by the ver&s;es under his pic|ture."</Q><Q><L>A man's be&s;t fortune or his wor&s;t's a wife,</L>

<P>Of all crimes which the heart of man conceives, as none is &s;o enormous as murder, &s;o it more frequently meets puni&s;hment in this life than any other. This barbarous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was &s;oon re|vealed; for notwith&s;tanding what the con&s;pirators
<PB N="118" REF="123">
had given out, &s;u&s;picions ran high that Sir Thomas was poi&s;oned; upon which We&s;ton was &s;trictly ex|amined by Lord Cook, who before his lord&s;hip per|&s;i&s;ted in denying the &s;ame; but the Bi&s;hop of Lon|don afterwards conver&s;ing with him, pre&s;&s;ing the thing home to his con&s;cience, and opening all the terrors of another life to his mind, he was moved to confe&s;s the whole. He related how Mrs. Tur|ner and the Counte&s;s became acquainted, and di&s;|covered all tho&s;e who were any way concerned in it; upon which they were all apprehended, and &s;ome &s;ent to Newgate, and others to the Tower. Having thus confe&s;&s;ed, and being convicted ac|cording to due cour&s;e of law, he was hanged at Tyburn, after him Mrs. Turner, after her Frank|lin, then Sir Gervis Yelvis, being found guilty on their &s;everal arraignments, were executed; &s;ome of them died penitent. The Earl and the Counte&s;s were both condemned, but notwith&s;tanding their guilt being greater than any of the other crimi|nals, the King, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all his &s;ub|jects, forgave them, but they were both forbid to appear at court.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;trangely unaccountable in the behaviour of Somer&s;et after condemna|tion. When he was asked what he thought of his condition, and if he was preparing to die, he an&s;wered, that he thought not of it at all, for he was &s;ure the King dur&s;t not command him to be executed. This ridiculous boa&s;ting and bidding defiance to his maje&s;ty's power, was con|&s;trued by &s;ome in a very odd manner; and there were not wanting tho&s;e who a&s;&s;erted, that Somer&s;et was privy to a &s;ecret of the King's, which if it had been revealed, would have produced the &s;trange&s;t con&s;ternation in the kingdom that ever was known, and drawn down infamy upon his maje&s;ty for ever; but as nothing can be a&s;certained concern|ing it, it might &s;eem unfair to impute to this &s;illy Prince more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s than he perhaps committed:
<PB N="119" REF="124">
It is certain he was the &s;lave of his favourites, and not the mo&s;t &s;hocking crime in them, it &s;eems, could entirely alienate his affections, and it is doubt|ful whether the &s;aving of Somer&s;et or the execution of Raleigh reflects mo&s;t di&s;grace upon his reign. Some have &s;aid, that the body of Sir Thomas Over|bury was thrown into an ob&s;cure pit; but Wood &s;ays it appears from the Tower regi&s;ters, that it was interred in the chapel; which &s;eems more probable.

After a long night of Gothic ignorance, after many ages of prie&s;tcraft and &s;uper&s;tition, learning and genius vi&s;ited our I&s;land in the days of the renown|ed Queen Elizabeth. It was then that liberty began to dawn, and the people having &s;hook off the re|&s;traints of prie&s;tly au&s;terity, pre&s;umed to think for them&s;elves. At an Aera &s;o remarkable as this, &s;o famous in his &s;tory, it &s;eems no wonder that the nation &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e immor|tal ornaments of wit and learning, who all con|&s;pired at once to make it famous.&mdash;This a&s;toni&s;h|ing genius, &s;eemed to be commi&s;&s;ioned from above, to deliver us not only from the ignorance under which we laboured as to poetry, but to carry poetry almo&s;t to its perfection. But to write a panegyric on Shake&s;pear appears as unnece&s;&s;ary, as the at|tempt would be vain; for whoever has any ta&s;te for what is great, terrible, or tender, may meet with the ample&s;t gratification in Shake&s;pear; as may tho&s;e al&s;o have a ta&s;te for drollery and true humour. His genius was almo&s;t boundle&s;s, and he &s;ucceeded alike in every part of writing. I cannot forbear giving the character of Shake&s;pear in
<PB N="124" REF="129">
the words of a great genius, in a prologue &s;poken by Mr. Garrick when he fir&s;t opened Drury-lane hou&s;e as Manager.<Q><L>When learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes,</L>
<L>Fir&s;t rear'd the &s;tage;&mdash;immortal Shake&s;pear ro&s;e,</L>
<L>Each change of many-coloured life he drew,</L>

<L>Exi&s;tence &s;aw him &s;purn her bounded reign,</L>
<L>And panting time toiled after him, in vain.</L></Q></P>
<P>All men have di&s;covered a curio&s;ity to know the little &s;tories and particularities of a great genius; for it often happens, that when we at|tend a man to his clo&s;et, and watch his moments of &s;olitude, we &s;hall find &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions drop from him, or we may ob&s;erve &s;uch in&s;tances of peculiar conduct, as will let us more into his real charac|ter, than ever we can di&s;cover while we conver&s;e with him in public, and when perhaps he appears under a kind of mask. There are but few things known of this great man; few incidents of his life have de&s;cended to po&s;terity, and tho' no doubt the fame of his abilities made a great noi&s;e in the age in which he flouri&s;hed; yet his &s;tation was not &s;uch as to produce many incidents, as it was &s;ubject to but few vici&s;&s;itudes. Mr. Rowe, who well under|&s;tood, and greatly admired Shake&s;pear, has been at pains to collect what incidents were known, or were to be found concerning him; and it is chiefly upon Mr. Rowe's authority we build the account now given.</P>
<P>Our author was the &s;on of John Shake&s;pear, and was born at Stratford upon Avon in Warwick&s;hire, April 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">, at it appears by public records relating to that town. The family from which he is de&s;cended was of good figure and fa&s;hion there, and are mentioned as gentlemen. His father, who was a con&s;iderable dea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er in wool, being incumbred with a large family
<PB N="125" REF="130">
of ten children, could afford to give his elde&s;t &s;on but a &s;lender education. He had bred him at a free &s;chool, where he acquired what Latin he was ma&s;ter of, but how well he under&s;tood that language, or whether after his leaving the &s;chool he made great|er proficiency in it, has been di&s;puted and is a point very difficult to &s;ettle. However it is certain, that Mr. John Shake&s;pear, our author's father, was obliged to withdraw him early from &s;chool, in order to have his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his own employment, towards &s;upporting the re&s;t of the family. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is without controver&s;y, &s;ays Rowe, that in his works we &s;carce find any traces that look like an imitation of the an|cients. The delicacy of his ta&s;te, and the natural bent of his own great genius, equal, if not &s;upe|rior to &s;ome of the be&s;t of theirs, would certainly have led him to read and &s;tudy them with &s;o much plea&s;ure, that &s;ome of their fine images would na|turally have in&s;inuated them&s;elves into, and been mixed with his own writings; &s;o that his not copying at lea&s;t &s;omething from them, may be an argument of his never having read them. Whether his ignorance of the ancients was di&s;|advantageous to him or no, may admit of di&s;pute; for tho' the knowledge of them might have made him more correct, yet it is not improba|ble, but that the regularity and deference for them which would have attended that correct|ne&s;s, might have re&s;trained &s;ome of that fire, impetuo&s;ity, and even beautiful extravagance, which we cannot help admiring in Shake&s;pear."</Q></P>
<P>As to his want of learning, Mr. Pope makes the following ju&s;t ob&s;ervation: That there is certainly a va&s;t difference between learning and languages. How far he was ignorant of the latter, I cannot (&s;ays he) determine; but it is plain he had much reading, at lea&s;t, if they will not call it learning; nor is it any great matter if a man has know|ledge,
<PB N="126" REF="131">
whether he has it from one language or from another. Nothing is more evident, than that he had a ta&s;te for natural philo&s;ophy, mechanics, ancient and modern hi&s;tory, poetical learning, and mytho|logy. We find him very knowing in the cu&s;toms, rites, and manners of the Romans. In Coriolanus, and Julius Cae&s;ar, not only the &s;pirit but manners of the Romans are exactly drawn; and &s;till a nicer di&s;tinction is &s;hewn between the manners of the Ro|mans in the time of the former and the latter. His reading in the ancient hi&s;torians is no le&s;s con&s;picu|ous, in many references to particular pa&s;&s;ages; and the &s;peeches copied from Plutarch in Coriolanus may as well be made in&s;tances of his learning as tho&s;e copied from Cicero in the Cataline of Ben John&s;on. The manners of other nations in gene|ral, the Aegyptians, Venetians. French, &amp;c. are drawn with equal propriety. Whatever object of nature, or branch of &s;cience, he either &s;peaks or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cribes, it is always with competent, if not ex|ten&s;ive, knowledge. His de&s;criptions are &s;till exact, and his metaphors appropriated, and remarkably drawn from the nature and inherent qualities of each &s;ubject.&mdash;We have tran&s;lations from Ovid publi&s;hed in his name, among tho&s;e poems which pa&s;s for his, and for &s;ome of which we have un|doubted authority, being publi&s;hed by him&s;elf, and dedicated to the Earl of Southampton. He appears al&s;o to have been conver&s;ant with Plautus, from whence he has taken the plot of one of his plays; he follows the Greek authors, and particularly Dares Phrygius in another, although I will not pre|tend, continues Mr. Pope, to &s;ay in what language he read them.</P>
<P>Mr. Warburton has &s;trongly contended for Shake&s;|pear's learning, and has produced many imitation; and parallel pa&s;&s;ages with ancient authors, in which I am inclined to think him right, and beg leave to produce few in&s;tances of it. He always, &s;ays Mr. Warbur|ton,
<PB N="127" REF="132">
makes an ancient &s;peak the language of an ancient. So Julius Cae&s;ar, Act I. Scene II.<Q><L>&mdash;Ye Gods, it doth amaze me,</L>
<L>A man of &s;uch a feeble temper &s;hould</L>
<L>So get the &s;tart of the maje&s;tic world,</L>
<L>And bear the palm alone.</L></Q></P>
<P>This noble image is taken from the Olympic games. This maje&s;tic world is a &s;ine periphra&s;is of the Roman Empire; maje&s;tic, becau&s;e the Romans ranked them&s;elves on a footing with kings, and a world, becau&s;e they called their empire Orbis Ro|manus; but the whole &s;tory &s;eems to allude to Cae&s;ar's great exemplar, Alexander, who, when he was asked whether he would run the cour&s;e of the Olympic games, replied, Yes, if the racers were kings.&mdash;So again in Anthony and Cleopatra, Act I. Scene I. Anthony &s;ays w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ub|limity,<Q><L>Let Rome in Tyber melt, and the wide arch</L>
<L>Of the razed Empire fall.</L></Q> Taken from the Roman cu&s;tom of rai&s;ing triumphal arches to perpetuate their victories.</P>
<P>And again, Act III. Scene IV. Octavia &s;ays to Anthony, of the difference between him and her brother,<Q><L>" Wars 'twixt you twain would be</L>
<L>" As if the world &s;hould cleave, and that &s;lain men</L>
<L>" Should &s;older up the re&s;t"&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>This thought &s;eems taken from the &s;tory of Curtius leaping into the Cha&s;m in the Forum, in order to clo&s;e it, &s;o that, as that was clo|&s;ed
<PB N="128" REF="133">
by one Roman, if the whole world were to cleave, Romans only could &s;older it up. The me|taphor of &s;oldering is extreamly exact, according to Mr. Warburton; for, &s;ays he, as metal is &s;oldered up by metal that is more refined than that which it &s;olders, &s;o the earth was to be &s;oldered by men, who are only a more refined earth.</P>
<P>The manners of other nations in general, the Egyptians, Venetians, French, &amp;c. are drawn with equal propriety. An in&s;tance of this &s;hall be pro|duced with regard to the Venetians. In the Mer|chant of Venice, Act IV. Scene I.<Q><L>&mdash;His lo&s;&s;es</L>
<L>That have of late &s;o huddled on his back,</L>
<L>Enough to pre&s;s a royal merchant down.</L></Q></P>
<P>We are not to imagine the word royal to be a random founding epither. It is u&s;ed with great propriety by the poet, and de&s;igned to &s;hew him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ell acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the people, whom he here brings upon the &s;tage. For when the French and Venetians in the beginning of the thir|teenth century, had won Con&s;tantinople, the French under the Emperor Henry endeavoured to extend their conq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ts, in the provinces of the Grecian em|pire on the Terra firma, while the Venetians be|ing ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, gave liberty to any &s;ubject of the Republic, who would fit out ve&s;&s;els to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the i&s;les of the Archipelago and other maritime places, to enjoy their con|que&s;ts in &s;overeignty, only doing homage to the Republic for their &s;everal principalities. In pur|&s;uance of this licence, the Sanudo's, the Ju&s;tiniani, the Grimaldi, the Summaripa's, and others, all Ve|netian merchants, erected principalities in the &s;eve|ral places of the Archipelago, and thereby became truly, and properly Royal Merchants.</P>
<P>But there are &s;everal places which one cannot forbear thinking a tran&s;lation from cla&s;&s;ic writers.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="134">In the Tempe&s;t Act V. Scene II. Pro&s;pero &s;ays,<Q><L>&mdash;I have&mdash;</L>
<L>Called forth the mutinous winds</L>
<L>And 'twixt the green &s;ea, and the azured vault</L>
<L>Set roaring war; to the dread ratling thunder,</L>
<L>Have I given fire, and rifted Jove's &s;tout oak,</L>
<L>With his own bolt; the &s;trong bas'd promontory,</L>

<P>But to return to the incidents of his life. Upon his quitting the grammar &s;chool, he &s;eems to have entire|ly devoted him&s;elf to that way of living which his father propo&s;ed, and in order to &s;ettle in the world after a family manner, thought fit to marry while he was yet very young. His wife was the daughter of one Hatchway, &s;aid to have been a &s;ub&s;tantial Yeo|man in the neighbourhood of Stratford. In this kind of dome&s;tic ob&s;curity he continued for &s;ome time, till by an unhappy in&s;tance of mi&s;conduct, he was obliged to quit the place of his nativity, and take &s;helter in London, which luckily proved the occa&s;ion of di&s;playing one of the greate&s;t genius's that ever was known in dramatic poetry. He had the misfortuue to fall into ill company: Among the&s;e
<PB N="130" REF="135">
were &s;ome who made a frequent practice of Deer|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ealing, and who engaged him more than once in robbing a park, that belonged to Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecot near Stratford; for which he was pro&s;e|cated by that gentleman, as he thought &s;omewhat too &s;everely; and in order to revenge him&s;elf of this &s;uppo&s;ed ill u&s;age, he made a ballad upon him; and tho this, probably the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of his poetry, be lo&s;t, yet it is &s;aid to have been &s;o very bitter, that it redoubled the pro&s;ecution again&s;t him to that de|gree, that he was obliged to leave his bu&s;ine&s;s and family for &s;ome time, and &s;helter him&s;elf in Lon|don. This Sir Thomas Lucy, was, it is &s;aid, af|terwards ridiculed by Shake&s;pear, under the well known character of Ju&s;tice Shallow.</P>
<P>It is at this time, and upon this accident, that he is &s;aid to have made his fir&s;t acquaintance in the playhou&s;e. Here I cannot forbear relating a &s;tory which Sir William Davenant told Mr. Betterton, who communicated it to Mr. Rowe; Rowe told it Mr. Pope, and Mr. Pope told it to Dr. Newton, the late editor of Milton, and from a gentleman, who heard it from him, 'tis here related.</P>
<P>Concerning Shake&s;pear's fir&s;t appearance in the playhou&s;e. When he came to London, he was with|out money and friends, and being a &s;tranger he knew not to whom to apply, nor by what means to &s;upport him&s;elf.&mdash;At that time coaches not being in u&s;e, and as gentlemen were accu&s;tomed to ride to the playhou&s;e, Shake&s;pear, driven to the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, went to the playhou&s;e door, and pick'd up a little money by taking care of the gentlemens hor&s;es who came to the play; he became eminent even in that profe&s;&s;ion, and was taken notice of for his di|ligence and skill in it; he had &s;oon more bu&s;ine&s;s than he him&s;elf could manage, and at la&s;t hired boys under him, who were known by the name of Shake&s;pear's boys: Some of the players accidental|ly conver&s;ing with him, found him &s;o acute, and
<PB N="131" REF="136">
ma&s;ter of &s;o fine a conver&s;ation, that &s;truck there|with, they and recommended him to the hou&s;e, in which he was fir&s;t admitted in a very low &s;tation, but he did not long remain &s;o, for he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, if not as an extraordinary actor, at lea&s;t as a fine writer. His name is prin|ted, as the cu&s;tom was in tho&s;e times, among&s;t tho&s;e of the other players, before &s;ome old plays, but without any particular account of what &s;ort of parts he u&s;ed to play: and Mr. Rowe &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that tho' he very carefully enquired, he found the top of his performance was the gho&s;t in his own Hamlet."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hould have been much more plea&s;ed,"</Q> continues Rowe, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to have learned from &s;ome certain authority which was the fir&s;t play he writ; it would be without doubt, a plea&s;ure to any man curious in things of this kind, to &s;ee and know what was the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of a fancy like Shake&s;pear's."</Q> The highe&s;t date which Rowe has been able to trace, is Romeo and Juliet, in 1597, when the author was thirty-three years old; and Richard II. and III. the next year, viz. the thirty-fourth of his age. Tho' the order of time in which his &s;everal pieces were written be generally uncertain, yet there are pa&s;&s;ages in &s;ome few of them, that &s;eem to fix their dates. So the chorus at the end of the fourth act of Henry V. by a compli|ment very hand&s;omely turned to the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, &s;hews the play to have been written when that Lord was general to the queen in Ireland; and his eulogium upon Queen Elizabeth, and her &s;ucce&s;&s;or King James in the latter end of his Henry VIII. is a proof of that play's being written after the acce&s;&s;ion of the latter of the&s;e two princes to the throne of England. Whatever the particular times of his wri|ting were, the people of the age he lived in, who be|gan to grow wonderfully fond of diver&s;ions of this kind, could not but be highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee a genius ari&s;e among&s;t them, of &s;o plea&s;urable, &s;o rich a vein,
<PB N="132" REF="137">
and &s;o plentifully capable of furni&s;hing their favou|rite entertainments. Be&s;ides the advantage which Shake&s;pear had over all men in the article of wit, he was of a &s;weet, gentle, amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and was a mo&s;t agreeable companion; &s;o that he became dear to all that knew him, both as a friend and as a poet, and by that means was introduced to the be&s;t company, and held conver&s;ation with the fine&s;t cha|racters of his time. Queen Elizabeth had &s;everal of his plays acted before her, and that prince&s;s was too quick a di&s;cerner, and rewarder of merit, to &s;uffer that of Shake&s;pear to be neglected. It is that mai|den prince&s;s plainly whom he intends by<Q><L>&mdash;A fair ve&s;tal, throned by the We&s;t.</L>
<BIBL>Mid&s;ummer night dream.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And in the &s;ame play he gives us a poetical and lively repre&s;entation of the Queen of Scots, and the fate &s;he met with,<Q><L>&mdash;Thou rememb're&s;t</L>
<L>Since once I &s;at upon a promontory,</L>
<L>And heard a &s;ea-maid on a dolphin's back,</L>
<L>Uttering &s;uch dulcet and harmonious breath,</L>
<L>That the rude &s;ea grew civil at her &s;ong,</L>
<L>And certain &s;tars &s;hot madly from their &s;pheres,</L>
<L>To hear the &s;ea-maid's mu&s;ic.</L></Q></P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the ad|mirable character of Fal&s;taff in the two parts of Hen|ry IV. that &s;he commanded him to continue it in one play more, and to make him in love. This is &s;aid to have been the occa&s;ion of his writing the Merry Wives of Wind&s;or. How well &s;he was obey|ed, the play it&s;elf is a proof; and here I cannot help ob&s;erving, that a poet &s;eldom &s;ucceeds in any &s;ub|ject a&s;&s;igned him, &s;o well as that which is his own
<PB N="133" REF="138">
choice, and where he has the liberty of &s;electing: Nothing is more certain than that Shake&s;pear has failed in the Merry Wives of Wind&s;or. And tho' that comedy is not without merit, yet it falls &s;hort of his other plays in which Fal&s;taff is introduced, and that Knight is not half &s;o witty in the Merry Wives of Wind&s;or as in Henry IV. The humour is &s;carcely natural, and does not excite-to laugh|ter &s;o much as the other. It appears by the epi|logue to Henry IV. that the part of Fal&s;taff was written originally under the name of Oldca&s;tle. Some of that family being then remaining, the Queen was plea&s;ed to command him to alter it, up|on which he made u&s;e of the name of Fal&s;taff. The fir&s;t offence was indeed avoided, but I am not &s;ure whe|ther the author might not be &s;omewhat to blame in his &s;econd choice, &s;ince it is certain, that Sir John Fal&s;taff who was a knight of the garter, and a lieutenant-general, was a name of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit in the wars with France, in Henry V. and Henry VIth's time.</P>
<P>Shake&s;pear, be&s;ides the Queen's bounty, was patronized by the Earl of Southampton, famous in the hi&s;tory of that time for his friend&s;hip to the unfortunate Earl of E&s;&s;ex. It was to that noble|man he dedicated his poem of Venus and Ado|nis, and it is reported, that his lord&s;hip gave our author a thou&s;and pounds to enable him to go through with a purcha&s;e he heard he had a mind to make. A bounty at that time very con&s;iderable, as money then was valued: there are few in&s;tances of &s;uch liberality in our t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mes.</P>
<P>There is no certain account when Shake&s;pear quitted the &s;tage for a private life. Some have thought that Spen&s;er's Thalia in the Tears of the Mu&s;es, where &s;he laments the lo&s;s of her Willy in the comic &s;cene, relates to our poet's abandoning the &s;tage. But it is well known that Spen&s;er him&s;elf died in the year 1598, and five years
<PB N="134" REF="139">
after this we find Shake&s;pear's name among&s;t the actors in Ben John&s;on's Sejanus, which fir&s;t made its appearance in the year 1603, nor could he then have any thoughts of retiring, &s;ince that very year, a licen&s;e by King James the fir&s;t was granted to him, with Burbage, Philipps, Hemmings, Condel, &amp;c. to exerci&s;e the art of playing come|dies, tragedies, &amp;c. as well at their u&s;ual hou&s;e called the Globe on the other &s;ide the water, as in any other parts of the kingdom, during his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure. This licen&s;e is printed in Ry|mer's Faedera; be&s;ides it is certain, Shake&s;pear did not write Macbeth till after the acce&s;&s;ion of James I. which he did as a compliment to him, as he there embraces the doctrine of witches, of which his Maje&s;ty was &s;o fond that he wrote a book cal|led Daemonalogy, in defence of their exi&s;tence; and likewi&s;e at that time began to touch for the Evil, which Shake&s;pear has taken notice of, and paid him a fine turned compliment. So that what Spen&s;er there &s;ays, if it relates at all to Shake&s;pear, mu&s;t hint at &s;ome occa&s;ional rece&s;s which he made for a time.</P>
<P>What particular friend&s;hips he contracted with pri|vate men, we cannot at this time know, more than that every one who had a true ta&s;te for merit, and could di&s;tingui&s;h men, had generally a ju&s;t value and e&s;teem for him. His exceeding candour and good nature mu&s;t certainly have inclined all the gentler part of the world to love him, as the pow|er of his wit obliged the men of the mo&s;t refined knowledge and polite learning to admire him. His acquaintance with Ben John&s;on began with a re|markable piece of humanity and good nature: Mr. John&s;on, who was at that time altogether unknown to the world, had offered one of his plays to the &s;tage, in order to have it acted, and the per&s;on into who&s;e hands it was put, after having turned it care le&s;sly over, was ju&s;t upon returning it to him with an ill-natured an&s;wer, that it would be of no &s;er|vice
<PB N="135" REF="140">
to their company, when Shake&s;pear luckily ca&s;t his eye upon it, and found &s;omething &s;o well in it, as to engage him fir&s;t to read it through, and afterwards to recommend Mr. John&s;on and his writings to the public.</P>
<P>The latter part of our author's life was &s;pent in ea&s;e and retirement, he had the good fortune to ga|ther an e&s;tate equal to his wants, and in that to his wi&s;h, and is &s;aid to have &s;pent &s;ome years before his death in his native Stratford. His plea&s;ant wit and good nature engaged him in the acquaintance, and entitled him to the friend&s;hip, of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood. It is &s;till remembered in that county, that he had a particular intimacy with one Mr. Combe, an old gentleman, noted there|abouts for his wealth and u&s;ury. It happened that in a plea&s;ant conver&s;ation among&s;t their common friends, Mr. Combe merrily told Shake&s;pear, that he fancied he intended to write his epitaph, if he happened to out-live him; and &s;ince he could not know what might be &s;aid of him when dead, he de&s;ired it might be done immediately; upon which Shake&s;pear gave him the&s;e lines.<Q><L>Ten in the hundred lyes here engraved,</L>
<L>'Tis a hundred to ten his &s;oul is not &s;aved:</L>
<L>If any man asketh who lies in this tomb?</L>
<L>Oh! oh! quoth the Devil, 'tis my John-a-Combe.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the &s;harpne&s;s of the &s;atire is &s;aid to have &s;tung the man &s;o &s;everely, that he never forgave it.</P>
<P>Shake&s;pear died in the fifty-third year of his age, and was buried on the North &s;ide of the chancel in the great church at Stratford, where a monument is placed on the wall. The following is the in&s;cription on his grave-&s;tone.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

<P>Ben John&s;on in his di&s;coveries has made a &s;ort of e&s;&s;ay towards the character of Shake&s;pear. I &s;hall pre&s;ent it the reader in his own words, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honour to Shake&s;pear, that in writing he never blotted out a line.

I had not told po&s;terity this, but for their ignorance, who chu&s;e that circum&s;tance to commend their friend by, wherein he mo&s;t faulted; and to ju&s;tify my own character (for I lov'd the man, and do honour to his memory, on this &s;ide idolatry, as much as any). He was indeed hone&s;t, and of an open free nature, had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expre&s;&s;ions, wherein he flowed with that facility, that &s;ometimes it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be &s;topp'd. His wit was in his own power: would the rule of it had been &s;o. Ma|ny times he fell into tho&s;e things which could not e&s;cape laughter, as when he &s;aid in the per&s;on of Cae&s;ar, one &s;peaking to him,<Q><PB N="137" REF="142">

The truth is, Ben was him&s;elf a better critic than poet, and though he was ready at di&s;covering the faults of Shake&s;pear, yet he was not ma&s;ter of &s;uch a ge|nius, as to ri&s;e to his excellencies; and great as John|&s;on was, he appears not a little tinctured with envy. Notwith&s;tanding the defects of Shake&s;pear, he is ju&s;tly elevated above all other dramatic writers. If ever any author de&s;erved the name of original (&s;ays Pope) it was he: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Shake&s;pear.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'His poetry was in&s;pi|ration indeed; he is not &s;o much an imitator, as in&s;trument of nature; and it is not &s;o ju&s;t to &s;ay of him that he &s;peaks from her, as that &s;he &s;peaks through him. His characters are &s;o much nature her&s;elf, that it is a &s;ort of injury to call them by &s;o di&s;tant a name as copies of her. The power over our pa&s;&s;ions was likewi&s;e never po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o eminent a degree, or di&s;played in &s;o many different in&s;tances, nor was he more a ma&s;ter of the great, than of the ridiculous in human nature, nor only excelled in the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ince he was full as admirable in the coolne&s;s of reflection and rea&s;oning: His &s;entiments are not only in general the mo&s;t pertinent and judicious up|on every &s;ubject, but by a talent very peculiar,

&s;omething between penetration and felicity, he hits upon that particular point, on which the bent of each argument, or the force of each mo|tive depends.'</Q></P>
<P>Our author's plays are to be di&s;tingui&s;hed only into Comedies and Tragedies. Tho&s;e which are called Hi&s;tories, and even &s;ome of his Comedies, are really Tragedies, with a mixture of Comedy among&s;t them. That way of Tragi-comedy was the common mi&s;take of that age, and is indeed be|come &s;o agreeable to the Engli&s;h ta&s;te, that though the &s;everer critics among us cannot bear it, yet the generality of our audiences &s;eem better plea&s;ed with it than an exact Tragedy. There is certainly a great deal of entertainment in his comic hu|mours, and a plea&s;ing and well di&s;tingui&s;hed vari|ety in tho&s;e characters he thought fit to exhibit with. His images are indeed every where &s;o live|ly, that the thing he would repre&s;ent &s;tands full before you, and you po&s;&s;e&s;s every part of it; of which this in&s;tance is a&s;toni&s;hing: it is an image of patience. Speaking of a maid in love, he &s;ays,<Q><L>&mdash;She never told her love,</L>
<L>But let concealment, like a worm i'th'bud,</L>
<L>Feed on her damask cheek: She pin'd in thought,</L>
<L>And &s;at like patience on a monument,</L>
<L>Smiling at grief.</L></Q></P>
<P>But what is characteri&s;tically the talent of Shake|&s;pear, and which perhaps is the mo&s;t excellent part of the drama, is the manners of his per&s;ons, in acting and in &s;peaking what is proper for them, and fit to be &s;hewn by the Poet, in making an ap|parent difference between his characters, and mark|ing every one in the &s;tronge&s;t manner.</P>
<P>Poets who have not a little &s;ucceeded in writ|ing for the &s;tage, have yet fallen &s;hort of their great original in the general power of the drama;

none ever found &s;o ready a road to the heart; his tender &s;cenes are inexpre&s;&s;ibly moving, and &s;uch as are meant to rai&s;e terror, are no le&s;s a|larming; but then Shake&s;pear does not much &s;hine when he is con&s;idered by particular pa&s;&s;ages; he &s;ometimes deba&s;es the noble&s;t images in nature by expre&s;&s;ions which are too vulgar for poetry. The ingenious author of the Rambler has ob|&s;erved, that in the invocation of Macbeth, before he proceeds to the murder of Duncan, when he thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf,
<Q><L>&mdash;Come thick night</L>
<L>And veil thee, in the dunne&s;t &s;moke of hell,</L>
<L>Nor heaven peep thro' the blanket of the dark,</L>
<L>To cry hold, hold.</L></Q>
that the words dunne&s;t and blanket, which are &s;o common in vulgar mouths, de&s;troy in &s;ome man|ner the grandeur of the image, and were two words of a higher &s;ignification, and removed above com|mon u&s;e, put in their place, I may challenge po|etry it&s;elf to &s;urni&s;h an image &s;o noble. Poets of an inferior cla&s;s, when con&s;idered by particular pa&s;&s;ages, are excellent, but then their ideas are not &s;o great, their drama is not &s;o &s;triking, and it is plain enough that they po&s;&s;e&s;s not &s;ouls &s;o ele|vated as Shake&s;pear's. What can be more beau|tiful than the flowing enchantments of Rowe; the delicate and tender touches of Otway and Southern, or the melting enthu&s;ia&s;m of Lee and Dryden, but yet none of their pieces have affect|ed the human heart like Shake&s;pear's.</P>
<P>But I cannot conclude the character of Shake|&s;pear, without taking notice, that be&s;ides the &s;uf|frage of almo&s;t all wits &s;ince his time in his fa|vour, he is particularly happy in that of Dryden, who had read and &s;tudied him clearly, &s;ometimes borrowed from him, and well knew where his

<P>But however well qualified our author's genius was for poetry, yet Langbain is of opinion that his hi&s;tory is the crown of all his works. It was printed about the year 1613, and dedicated to Queen Anne. It reaches from the &s;tate of Britain under the Romans, to the beginning of the reign of Richard II. His hi&s;tory has received enco+miums from various hands, as well as his poetry: It was continued by John Tru&s;ul, with like brevity and candour, but not with equal ele|gance, 'till the reign of Richard III. A. D. 1484. Mr. Daniel lived re&s;pected by men of worth and fa&s;hion, he pa&s;&s;ed through life without ta&s;t|ing many of the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune; he &s;eems to have been a &s;econd rate genius, and a tolera|ble ver&s;ifier; his poetry in &s;ome places is tender, but want of fire is his characteri&s;tical fault. He was unhappy in the choice of his &s;ubject of a civil war for a poem, which obliged him to de&s;cend to minute de&s;criptions, and nothing merely narrative can properly be touched in po|etry, which demands flights of the imagination and bold images.</P>

He had the rudiments of his education at Eaton; thence removing to Cambridge, he there commenced ma&s;ter of arts, and before he arrived at his 30th year, he favoured the world with a tran&s;lation of the Orlando Furio&s;o of Ario&s;to, by which he acquired &s;ome reputation. After this work, he compo&s;ed four books of epigrams, which in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">mes were received with great applau&s;e; &s;everal of the&s;e mention another humorous piece of his called Mi&s;acmos Metamorpho&s;is, which for a while expo&s;ed him to her Maje&s;ty's re&s;entment, yet he was afterwards received into favour. This (&s;ays Mrs. Cooper) is not added to the re&s;t of his works, and therefore &s;he &s;uppo&s;es was only meant for a Court amu&s;ement, not the entertainment of the public, or the increa&s;e of his &s;ame. In the reign of King James I. he was created Knight of the Bath<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>, and pre&s;ented a manu&s;cript to Prince Henry, called a Brief View of the State of the Church of England, as it &s;tood in Queen Eliza|beth and King James's reign in the year 1608. This piece was levelled chiefly again&s;t the mar|ried bi&s;hops, and was intended only for the pri|vate u&s;e of his Highne&s;s, but was &s;ome years af|terwards publi&s;hed by one of Sir John's grand|&s;ons, and occa&s;ioned much di&s;plea&s;ure from the clergy, who did not fail to recollect that his con|duct was of a piece with his doctrines, as he, to|gether with Robert earl of Leice&s;ter, &s;upported Sir Walter Raleigh in his &s;uit to Queen Elizabeth for the manor of Banwell, belonging to the bi&s;hopric of Bath and Wells, on the pre&s;umption that the right reverend incumbent had incurred a Premunire, by marrying a &s;econd wife.</P>

Sir John appears to be a gentleman of great plea&s;antry and humour; his fortune was ea&s;y, the court his element, and which is ever an ad|vantage to an author, wit was not his bu&s;ine&s;s, but diver&s;ion: 'Tis not to be doubted, but his tran&s;la|tion of Ario&s;to was publi&s;hed after Spen&s;er's Fairy Queen, and yet both in language and numbers it is much inferior, as much as it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e the genius of Harrington was below that of Spen&s;er.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cooper remarks, that the whole poem of Or|lando is a tedious medley of unnatural characters, and improbable events, and that the author's patron, Cardinal Hippolito De E&s;te, had &s;ome rea&s;on for that &s;evere que&s;tion, Where the devil, Signior Lu|dovico, did you pick up all the&s;e damned lies? The genius of Ario&s;to &s;eems infinitely more fit for &s;atire than heroic poetry; and &s;ome are of opinion, that had Harrington wrote nothing but epigrams, he had been more in his own way.</P>
<P>We cannot certainly fix the time that Sir John died, but it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that it was a|bout the middle, or rather towards the latter end of James I's reign. I &s;hall &s;ubjoin an epigram of his as a &s;pecimen of his poetry.

<P>A Poet who lived in the reign of King James I. and as he was cotemporary with Ben John|&s;on, &s;o he became more eminent by having a quarrel with that great man, than by all his works. Decker was but an indifferent poet, yet even in tho&s;e days he wanted not his admirers; he had al&s;o friends among the poets; one of whom, Mr. Richard Brome, always called him Father; but it is the misfortune of little wits, that their admirers are as incon&s;idera|ble as them&s;elves, for Brome's applau&s;es confer no great honour on tho&s;e who enjoy them. Our au|thor joined with Web&s;ter in writing three plays, and with Rowley and Ford in another; and Langbaine a&s;&s;erts. that the&s;e plays in which he only contribu|ted a part, far exceed tho&s;e of his own compo&s;iti|on.

<P>Our poet left behind him one daughter, Mrs. Frances Beaumont, who lived to a great age and died in Leice&s;ter&s;hire &s;ince the year 1700.

<HEAD>Mr. JOHN FLETCHER</HEAD>
<P>Was &s;on of Dr. Richard Fletcher, Lord Bi&s;hop of London, and was born in Northampton&s;hire in the year 1576. He was educated at Cambridge, probably at Burnet-college, to which his father was by his la&s;t will and te&s;tament a benefactor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Langbaine's Lives of the Poets.</NOTE>. He wrote plays jointly with Mr. Beaumont, and Wood
<PB N="157" REF="162">
&s;ays he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Ben John&s;on in a Comedy called The Widow. After Beaumont's death, it is &s;aid he con&s;ulted Mr. James Shirley in forming the plots of &s;everal of his plays, but which tho&s;e were we have no means of di&s;overing. The editor of Beaumont and Fletcher's plays in 1711 thinks it very probable that Shirley &s;upplied many that were left imperfect, and that the players gave &s;ome remains of Fletcher's for Shirley to make up; and it is from hence (he &s;ays) that in the fir&s;t act of Love's Pilgrimage, there is a &s;cene of an o&s;tler tran&s;cribed verbatim out of Ben John&s;on's New Inn, Act I. Scene I. which play was written long after Fletcher died, and tran&s;planted into Love's Pilgrimage, after printing the New Inn, which was in the year 1630, and two of the plays printed under Fletcher's name. The Coronation and The Little Thief have been claimed by Shir|ley as his; it is probable they were left imper|fect by the one, and fini&s;hed by the other. Mr. Fletcher died of the plague in the forty ninth year of his age, the fir&s;t of King Charles I. An. 1625, and was buried in St. Mary Overy's Church in Southwark.</P>
<P>Beaumont and Fletcher, as has been ob&s;erved, wrote plays in concert, but what &s;hare each bore in forming the plots, writing the &s;cenes, &amp;c. is unknown. The general opinion is, that Beaumont's judgment was u&s;ually employed in correcting and retrenching the &s;uperfluities of Fletcher's wit, who&s;e fault was, as Mr. Cartwright expre&s;&s;es it, to do too much; but if Win&s;tanley may be credited, the former had his &s;hare likewi&s;e in the drama, for that author relates, that our poets meeting once at a tavern in order to form the rude draught of a tragedy, Fletcher undertook to kill the king, which words being overheard by a waiter, he was officious enough, in order to recommend him&s;elf, to lodge an information again&s;t them: but their loy|alty
<PB N="158" REF="163">
being unque&s;tioned, and the relation of the circum&s;tance probable, that the vengeance was only aimed at a theatrical monarch, the affair ended in a je&s;t.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t play which brought them into e&s;|teem, as Dryden &s;ays, was Phila&s;ter, or Love lies a Bleeding; for, before that, they had written two or three very un&s;ucce&s;sfully, as the like is re|ported of Ben John&s;on before he writ Every Man in his Humour. The&s;e authors had with the advantage of the wit of Shake&s;pear, which was their prece|dent, great natural gifts improved by &s;tudy. Their plots are allowed generally more regular than Shake|&s;pear's; they touch the tender pa&s;&s;ions, and excite love in a very moving manner; their faults, not|with&s;tanding Beaumont's ca&s;tigation, con&s;i&s;t in a certain luxuriance, and &s;tretching their &s;peeches to an immoderate length; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a coar&s;ene&s;s of dialogue, even in their genteel|e&s;t characters, in comedy, that appears now almo&s;t unpardon|able; one is almo&s;t inclined to think the language and manners of tho&s;e times were not over-polite, this fault appears &s;o fre|quent; nor is the great Shake&s;pear entirely to be acquitted hereof.</NOTE> however, it mu&s;t be owned their wit is great, their language &s;uited to the pa&s;&s;ions they rai&s;e, and the age in which they lived is a &s;ufficient apology for their defects. Mr. Dryden tells us, in his E&s;&s;ay on Dramatic Po|etry, that Beaumont and Fletcher's plays in his time were the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and frequent enter|tainments of the &s;tage, two of theirs being acted through the year for one of Shake&s;pear's or John&s;on's; and the rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igns is, becau&s;e there is a certain gaiety in their comedies, and a pathos in their mo&s;t &s;erious plays which &s;uits generally with all men's humours; but however it might be when Dryden writ, the ca&s;e is now rever&s;ed, for Beaumont and Fletcher's plays are not acted above once a &s;ea&s;on, while one of Shake&s;pear's is re|pre&s;ented

The&s;e noble authors have received incen&s;e of prai&s;e from the highe&s;t pens; they were loved and e&s;teemed by their co|temporaries, who have not failed to demon&s;trate their re&s;pect by various copies of ver&s;es at dif|ferent times, and upon different occa&s;ions, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to them, the in&s;ertion of which would ex|ceed the bounds propo&s;ed for this work. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that among&s;t the illu&s;trious names of their admirers, are Denham, Waller, Cart|wright, Ben John&s;on, Sir John Berkenhead, and Dryden him&s;elf, a name more than equal to all the re&s;t. But the works of our authors have not e&s;caped the cen&s;ure of critics, e&s;pecially Mr. Rhymer the hi&s;toriographer, who was really a man of wit and judgment, but &s;omewhat ill natured; for he has laboured to expo&s;e the faults, without taking any notice of the beauties of Rollo Duke of Nor|mandy, the King and No King, and the Maids Tragedy, in a piece of his called The Tragedies of the La&s;t Age con&s;idered, and examined by the practice of the ancients, and by the common &s;en&s;e of all ages, in a letter to Fleetwood Shepherd e&s;quire.

<HEAD>Sir JOHN DAVIES</HEAD>
<P>WAS born at Chi&s;grove, in the pari&s;h of Ty&s;|bury in Wilt&s;hire, being the &s;on of a wealthy tanner of that place. At fifteen years of age he be|came a Commoner in Queen's-college, Oxford 1585, where having made preat progre&s;s in academical learning, and taken the degree of Batchelor of arts, he removed to the Middle-Temple, and applying him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the common law, was called to the bar; but having a quarrel with one Richard Martyn, (afterwards recorder of London) he ba&s;ti|nadoed him in the Temple-hall at dinner-time, in pre&s;ence of the whole a&s;&s;embly, for which con|tempt, he was immediately expelled, and retired a|gain to Oxford to pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies, but did not re&s;ume the &s;cholar's gown. Upon this occa&s;ion he compo&s;ed that excellent poem called No&s;ce Teip|&s;um<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mu&s;es library p. 332.</NOTE>. Afterwards by the favour of Thomas lord Elle&s;mere, keeper of the Great Seal, being rein&s;ta|ted in the Temple, he practi&s;ed as a coun&s;ellor, and became a burge&s;s in the Parliament held at We&s;tmin&s;ter 1601. Upon the death of Queen Eli|zabeth our author, with Lord Hun&s;don, went into Scotland to congratulate King James on his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the Engli&s;h throne. Being introduced in|to his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence, the King enquired of Lord Hun&s;don, the names of the gentlemen who accompanied him, and when his lord&s;hip men|tioned John Davies, the King pre&s;ently a&s;ked whe|ther he was No&s;ce Teip&s;um, and being an&s;wered he was, embraced him, and a&s;&s;ured him of
<PB N="168" REF="173">
his favour. He was accordingly made Sollicitor, and a little after Attorney-general in Ireland, where in the year 1606, he was made one of his Maje&s;ty's &s;erjeants at law, and Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons for that kingdom. In the year following, he received the honour of knighthood from the King at Whitehall. In 1612 he quitted the po&s;t of Attorney-general in Ireland, and was made one of his Maje&s;ty's Engli&s;h &s;erjeants at law. He married Eleanor Touchet, younge&s;t daughter of George lord Audley, by whom he had a &s;on an idiot who died young, and a daughter named Lucy, married to Ferdinand lord Ha&s;tings, and afterwards Earl of Huntingdon. His lady was a woman of very extraordinary character; &s;he had, or rather pretended to have a &s;pirit of prophecy, and her predictions received from a voice which &s;he often heard, were generally wrapped up in dark and ob&s;cure expre&s;&s;ions. It was commonly reported, that on the &s;unday before her husband's death, &s;he was &s;itting at dinner with him, &s;he &s;uddenly bur&s;t into tears, whereupon he asking her the occa&s;ion, &s;he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Husband, the&s;e are your funeral tears,"</Q> to which he replied,<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Pray therefore &s;pare your tears now, and I will be content that you &s;hall laugh when I am dead."</Q> After Sir John's death &s;he lived privately at Par&s;ton in Hertford&s;hire, and an account was publi&s;hed of her &s;trange and wonderful prophecies in 1609.</P>
<P>In 1626 Sir John was appointed lord chief ju&s;tice of the King's-bench, but before the cere|mony of his in&s;tallation could be performed he died &s;uddenly of an apoplexy in the fifty-&s;eventh year of his age, and was buried in the church of St. Martin's in the Fields. He enjoyed the joint applau&s;es of Camden, Ben John&s;on, Sir John Har|rington, Selden, Donne, and Corbet; the&s;e are great authorities in our author's favour, and I may fairly a&s;&s;ert that no philo&s;ophical writers ever ex|plained

<P>In quality of a lawyer Sir John produced the following pieces:<LIST>

It was re|publi&s;hed by Nahum Tate, 1714, addre&s;&s;ed to the Earl of Dor&s;et and Middle&s;ex, who was a great ad|mirer of our poet, and the editor gives it a very ju&s;t and advantageous character. Without doubt it is the No&s;ce Teip&s;um &s;o much admired by King James, printed 1599, and 1622, mentioned by Wood; to which were added by the &s;ame hand:</P>
<P>Hymns of A&s;trea in acro&s;tic ver&s;e; and Orche&s;tra, or a poem expre&s;&s;ing the antiquity and excellency of dancing, in a dialogue, between Penelope and one of her Woers, containing 131 &s;tanzas unfini&s;hed.

<HEAD>Sir FULK GREVILLE, Lord BROOKE,</HEAD>
<P>SPRUNG from an honourable family in War|wick&s;hire; he was educated both at Oxford and Cambridge, and introduced to court by an uncle in the &s;ervice of Queen Elizabeth, who received him into her favour, which he had the happine&s;s to pre&s;erve uninterupted to her death. At the coronation of James I. he was created Knight of the Bath, and &s;oon after obtained a grant of the ruinous ca&s;tle of Warwick. He was next appointed &s;ub-trea&s;urer, chancellor of the Exchequer, and privy coun&s;ellor, and then ad|vanced to the degree of a baron, by the title of lord Brooke of Beauchamps-court, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to his Maje&s;ty, This noble author was the friend of Sir Philip Sidney, than which a greater compliment cannot be be&s;tow|ed. As he was a poet and a man of wit he was held in the highe&s;t e&s;teem in that courtly age; but he added to genius, a gallantry of &s;pi|rit, and was as fine a &s;oldier as a writer. Win|&s;tanley gives an in&s;tance of his prowe&s;s in arms. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At the time (&s;ays he) when the French amba&s;|&s;ador came over to England to negotiate a mar|riage between the duke of Anjou, and Queen Elizabeth, for the better entertainment of the court, &s;olemn ju&s;ts were proclaimed, where the Earl of Arundel, Frederick lord Wind&s;or, Sir Philip
<PB N="174" REF="179">
Sidney, and he, were chief challengers again&s;t all comers; in which challenge he behaved him&s;elf &s;o gallantly, that he won the reputa|tion of a mo&s;t valiant knight. Thus you &s;ee that tho' ea&s;e be the nur&s;e of poetry, the Mu|&s;es are al&s;o companions to Mars, as may be exemplified in the characters of the Earl of Surry, Sir Philip Sidney, and Sir Fulk Gre|ville."</Q></P>

<HEAD>Sir WALTER RALEIGH</HEAD>
<P>WAS de&s;cended of an ancient family in Devon|&s;hire, which was &s;eated in that county before the conque&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince's Worthies of Devon.</NOTE>, and was fourth &s;on of Walter Raleigh, e&s;quire, of Fards, in the pari&s;h of Cornwood. He was born in the year 1552 at Hayes, a plea&s;ant farm of his father's in the pari&s;h of Budley, in that part of Devon&s;hire bordering Ea&s;tward upon the Sea, near where the Ottery di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Briti&s;h Channel; he was educated at the uni|ver&s;ity of Oxford, where, according to Dr. Ful|ler, he became a commoner of Oriel College, as well as Chri&s;t Church, and di&s;played in his early years a great vivacity of genius in his applica|tion to his &s;tudies. Some have &s;aid, that after leaving the univer&s;ity, he &s;ettled him&s;elf in the Middle-Temple, and &s;tudied the law, but this opinion mu&s;t be erroneous, &s;ince he declares after|wards on his trial, that he never read a word of law 'till he was pri&s;oner in the Tower. In 1569, when he was not above 17 years of age, he was one of the &s;elect troop of a hundred gentlemen voluntiers, whom Queen Elizabeth permitted Hen|ry Champernon to tran&s;port into France, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of prote&s;tant Princes there<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Camdeni Annales Elizabethae, p. 172.

So great a &s;cene of action as the whole kingdom of France was at that period, gave Raleigh an opportunity of acquiring experience, and reading characters, as well as improving him&s;elf in the knowledge of languages and manners, and his own Hi&s;tory of the World contains &s;ome remarks which he
<PB N="181" REF="186">
then made of the conduct of &s;ome great generals there, of which he had him&s;elf been witne&s;s. Af|ter our author's return from France, he embarked in an expedition to the northern parts of Ameri|ca, with Sir Humphry Gilbert, his brother by the mother's &s;ide, that gentleman having obtained the Queen's Patent to plant and inhabit &s;uch parts of it as were unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Prince with whom &s;he was in alliance; but this attempt proved un|&s;ucce&s;sful by means of the divi&s;ion which aro&s;e among&s;t the Voluntiers. The next year, 1580, up|on the de&s;cent of the Spani&s;h and Italian forces in Ireland under the Pope's banner, for the &s;up|port of the De&s;monds in their rebellion in Mun|&s;ter, he had a captain's commi&s;&s;ion under the lord Grey of Wilton, to whom at that time the famous Spen&s;er was &s;ecretary; but the chief &s;ervices which captain Raleigh performed, were under Thomas earl of Ormond, governor of Mun&s;ter. He &s;ur|prized the Iri&s;h Kerns at Ramile, and having in|clo&s;ed them, took every rebel upon the &s;pot, who did not fall in the conflict. Among the pri&s;oners there was one laden with Withies, who being asked, what he intended to have done with them? boldly an&s;wered, to have hung up the Engli&s;h Churles; upon which Raleigh ordered him to be immediately di&s;patched in that manner, and the re&s;t of the robbers and murderers to be puni&s;hed according to their de&s;erts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hoolter, fol. 167.</NOTE>. The earl of Or|mond departing for England in the &s;pring of the year 1581, his government of Mun&s;ter was given to captain Raleigh; in which he behaved with great vigilance and honour, he fought the Arch rebel Barry at Clove, whom he charged with the utmo&s;t bravery, and after a hard &s;truggle, put to flight. In the month of Augu&s;t, 1581, captain John Gouch being appointed Governour of Mun|&s;ter
<PB N="182" REF="187">
by the Lord Deputy, Raleigh attended him in &s;everal journies to &s;ettle and compo&s;e that country; but the chief place of their re&s;idence was Cork, and after Gouch had cut off Sir John De&s;mond, brother to the earl of De&s;mond, who was at the head of the rebellion, he left the government of that city to Raleigh<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;e's Hi&s;tory of Ireland, fol. 367.</NOTE>, who&s;e com|pany being not long after disbanded upon the reduction of that earl, the &s;laughter of his bro|ther, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Barry, he returned to England. The Lord Deputy Grey having re&s;ign|ed the &s;word in Ireland towards the end of Au|gu&s;t, 1582, the di&s;pute between him and Raleigh, upon rea&s;ons which are variou&s;ly a&s;&s;igned by diffe|rent writers, was brought to a hearing before the council table in England, where the latter &s;upport|ed his cau&s;e with &s;uch abilities as procured him the good opinion both of her Maje&s;ty, and the Lords of the Council, and this, added to the patro|nage of the earl of Leice&s;ter, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be one con&s;iderable occa&s;ion of his preferment, though it did not immediately take place, nor could the hopes of it re&s;train him from a &s;e|cond expedition with his brother Sir Humphry Gilbert to Newfoundland, for which he built a &s;hip of 200 tons called The Bark Raleigh, and furni&s;hed it compleatly for the voyage, in which he re&s;olved to attend his brother as his Vice-Ad|miral. That fleet departed from Plymouth the 11th of June, 1583, but after it had been two or three days at &s;ea, a contagious di&s;temper having &s;eized the whole crew of Raleigh's &s;hip, obliged him to return to that port; however by this acci|dent, he e&s;caped the misfortune of that expediti|on; for after Sir Humphry had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newfoundland, in the right of the crown of Eng|land, and a&s;&s;igned lands to every man of his com|pany,

and &s;ailed three hundred leagues in the voyage home with full hopes of the Queen's a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to fit out a fleet next year, he unfortu|nately peri&s;hed; for venturing ra&s;hly in a frigate of but ten tons, he was on the ninth of Septem|ber that year at midnight &s;wallowed up in an high &s;ea, another ve&s;&s;el &s;uffered the &s;ame fate, and even the re&s;t returned not without great hazard and lo&s;s<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Captain Haynes's Report of Sir Humphry Gilbert's voyage to Newfoundland, vol. iii. p. 149.</NOTE>: but this ill &s;ucce&s;s could not divert Raleigh from pur&s;uing a &s;cheme of &s;uch impor|tance to his country as tho&s;e di&s;coveries in North America. He drew up an account of the advan|tage of &s;uch a de&s;ign, and the means of pro&s;e|cuting it, which he laid before the Queen and Council, who were &s;o well &s;atisfied with the pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s, that on the 25th of March, 1584, her Maje&s;ty granted him letters patent, in favour of his project, containing free liberty to di&s;cover &s;uch remote heathen and barbarous lands, as were not actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chi&s;tian prince, nor inhabited by Chri&s;tian people. Immediately upon this grant, Raleigh cho&s;e two able and experienced captains, and furni&s;hed them with two ve&s;&s;els fitted out at his own expence, with &s;uch expedition that on the 27th of April following they &s;et &s;ail for the We&s;t of England, taking their cour&s;e by the Canary I&s;lands, where they arrived on the 10th of May, towards the We&s;t Indies; and that being in tho&s;e days the be&s;t and mo&s;t frequented rout to America, they pa&s;&s;ed by the Carribbe I&s;lands in the beginning of June, and reached the Gulph of Florida on the 2d of July, &s;ailing along the &s;hore about one hundred and twenty miles before they could find a convenient harbour. At la&s;t they debarked in a very low land, which proved to be an i&s;land called Wohoken; and after taking for|mal
<PB N="184" REF="189">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, they carried on a friendly corre&s;pondence with the native Indians, who &s;upplied them with a great variety of fi&s;h and veni&s;on, and gave them furs, and deer&s;kins in exchange for trifles. Thus encouraged by the na|tives, eight of the company in a boat, went up the river Occam twenty miles, and next day in the evening they came to an i&s;land called Roanah, which was but &s;even leagues from the place where their &s;hips lay. Here they found the re&s;idence of the Indian chief, who&s;e name was Grangamineo, who&s;e hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of nine apartments built of Cedar, fortified round with &s;harp pieces of tim|ber: His wife came out to them, and ordered the people to carry them from the boat on their backs, and &s;hewed them many other civilities. They con|tinued their intercour&s;e with the natives for &s;ome time, &s;till viewing the &s;ituation of the adjacent country, and after having obtained the be&s;t infor|mation they could of the number and &s;trength of the Indian nations in that neighbourhood, and of their connexions, alliances, or conte&s;ts with each other, they returned about the middle of Septem|ber to England, and made &s;uch an advantageous report of the fertility of the &s;oil, and healthine&s;s of the climate, that the Queen favoured the de|&s;ign of &s;ettling a colony in that country, to which &s;he was plea&s;ed to give the name of Virginia<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Oldys, fol. 125.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>About two months after, Raleigh was cho&s;en Knight of the Shire for his county of Devon, and made a con&s;iderable figure in parliament, where a bill pa&s;&s;ed in confirmation of his patent for the di&s;covery of foreign countries. During the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ions, he received the honour of knight|hood from her Maje&s;ty, a di&s;tinction the more honourable to him, as the Queen was extream|ly cautious in confering titles; and be&s;ides the
<PB N="185" REF="190">
patent for di&s;coveries, &s;he granted him, about the &s;ame time, a power to licen&s;e the vending of wines through|out the kingdom, which was in all probability ve|ry lucrative to him; but it engaged him in a di&s;pute with the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, which had oppo&s;ed one Keymer, whom he had licen&s;ed to &s;ell wine there, contrary to the privileges of that univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>The parliament being prorogued, Raleigh, in|tent upon planting his new colony in Virginia, &s;et out his own fleet of &s;even &s;ail for that country, un|der the command of his cou&s;in Sir Richard Green|ville, who after having vi&s;ited the country, left behind him an hundred and &s;even per&s;ons to &s;ettle a colony at Roanah; in his return to England, he took a Spani&s;h prize worth 50000l. but this was not the only circum&s;tance of good fortune which hap|pened to Raleigh this year; for the rebellion in Ireland being now &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the forfeited lands divided into Signiories, among tho&s;e principally who had been in&s;trumental in the important &s;ervice of reducing that country; her Maje&s;ty granted him one of the large&s;t portions, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve thou&s;and acres in the counties of Cork and Waterford, with certain privileges and immunities, upon condition, of planting and improving the &s;ame, to which the other grantees were obliged.</P>
<P>In the year 1586 we find our author &s;o highly advanced in the Queen's favour, &s;o extremely po|pular on account of his patronage of learned men, and the active &s;pirit he exerted in bu&s;ine&s;s, that her Maje&s;ty made him &s;ene&s;chal in the dutchy of Corn|wall. But the&s;e di&s;tinctions incurred the u&s;ual ef|fects of court preferment, and expo&s;ed Sir Walter to the envy of tho&s;e who were much inferior to him in merit; and even the earl of Leice&s;ter him&s;elf, who had formerly been his great patron, became jealous of him, and &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to him, his nephew the young earl of E&s;&s;ex. The Come|dians likewi&s;e took the liberty to reflect upon Ra|leigh's
<PB N="186" REF="191">
power, and influence upon the Queen; which her Maje&s;ty re&s;ented &s;o highly as to forbid Tarleton, the mo&s;t celebrated actor of that age, from approach|ing her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Raleigh, &s;ollicitous for the pro&s;perity of the plan|tation in Virginia, &s;ent out new &s;upplies from time to time, &s;ome of whom were obliged to return home; and the general alarm &s;pread over the nation on ac|count of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, threw all things into di&s;order.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1587 he was rai&s;ed to the dignity of captain of her maje&s;ty's guard, which he held together with the place of lord-war|den of the Stannaries, and lieutenant-general of the county of Cornwall. From this time till the year 1594, we find Sir Walter continually engaged in pro|jecting new expeditions, &s;ending &s;uccours to colonies abroad, or managing affairs in Parliament with con|&s;ummate addre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the year 1593, we find Father Par&s;ons the je&s;uit charging him with no le&s;s a crime than athei&s;m, and that he had founded a &s;chool in which he taught athei&s;tical principles, and had made a great many young gentlemen converts to them; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable authority to countenance the &s;u&s;|picions of Sir Walter's religion, is that of Archbi&s;hop Abbot, who in a letter dated at Lambeth, addre&s;&s;ed to Sir Thomas Roe, then an amba&s;&s;ador at the Mo|gul's court, expre&s;sly charges Sir Walter with doubting God's being and omnipotence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's li&s;e of Raleigh.</NOTE>; but it is highly probable Sir Walter's opinions might be mi&s;repre&s;ented by his enemies, or wrong conclu&s;i|ons drawn from tho&s;e which he maintained; and it would be a &s;hocking inju&s;tice to the memory of &s;o great a man to &s;u&s;pect him of irreligion, who&s;e writings contain not the lea&s;t trace of it, and who&s;e Hi&s;tory of the World in particular breathes a &s;trong &s;pirit of real and genuine piety.</P>
<P>In the heighth of his favour with the Queen, he fell un|der

her maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure, for being enamoured of Mrs. Elizabeth Throgmorton, one of the Queen's maids of honour, whom he debauched; and &s;uch it &s;eems was the cha&s;tity of the&s;e times, that a frailty of that &s;ort was looked upon as the highe&s;t offence Her Maje&s;ty was &s;o exa&s;perated, that &s;he command|ed him to be confined &s;everal months, and after his enlargement forbid him the court, whence the poor lady was likewi&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from her attendance about the maiden queen, who appeared in this ca&s;e the champion of virginity. Sir Walter &s;oon made her an honourable reparation by marriage, and they were both examples of conjugal affection and fidelity. During the time our author continued under her ma|je&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure for this offence, he projected the di&s;covery of the rich and exten&s;ive empire of Gui|ana, in the &s;outh of America, which the Spaniards had then vi&s;ited, and to that day had never conquered. For this purpo&s;e, having collected informations re|lating to it, he &s;ent an old officer to take a view of the coa&s;t, who returned the year following with a very favourable account of the riches of the country, which he had received from &s;ome of the principal Ca&s;&s;iques upon the borders of it. This determined Raleigh's re&s;olution, who provided a &s;quadron of &s;hips at a very great expence, and the lord high admiral Howard, and Sir Robert Cecil con|ceived &s;o good an opinion of the de&s;ign, that both concurred in it. He per&s;onally engaged in the at|tempt, and with no great number of &s;hips &s;o far explor|ed the unknown country, that he made greater progre&s;s in a few months than the Spaniards had done for many years, and having &s;atisfied him&s;elf of the certainty of the gold mines of the country, he returned home with honour and riches the latter end of the &s;ummer 1595, and in the year following publi&s;hed in quarto An Account of the Voyage and Di&s;coveries, dedicated to lord admiral Howard and Sir Robert Cecil.</P>

After his return from the &s;ucce&s;s|ful expedition under the earl of E&s;&s;ex, he promoted a reconciliation between that nobleman and &s;ecretary Cecil, in con&s;equence of which he was him&s;elf fully rein&s;tated in the Queen's &s;avour, and had the com|mand of captain of the guard re&s;tored to him with other marks of her forgivene&s;s.</P>

In the council of war, which was held before the i&s;le of Flores, it was re&s;olved that the general and Sir Walter &s;hould jointly attack the i&s;land of Fyal; where the latter waited &s;even days for his lord&s;hip, and hearing nothing of him, cal|led a council of war, in which it was determined that Raleigh &s;hould attempt the town him&s;elf, which he did with a&s;toni&s;hing bravery and &s;ucce&s;s. E&s;&s;ex finding him&s;elf deprived of the honour of taking Fyal, was exa&s;perated to &s;uch a degree, that he broke &s;ome of the officers who had behaved with great

Upon their return to England the earl endeavoured to transfer the mi&s;carriages of the expedition upon Raleigh, and gained to his &s;ide the populace, whom Sir Walter never courted, and who&s;e patronage he &s;corned; but the Queen her&s;elf was not well plea&s;ed with the earl's conduct, &s;ince it was judged he might have done more than he did; and his proceedings again&s;t Sir Walter in calling his actions to public que&s;tion, were highly di&s;approved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter of Rowland White, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to Sir Robert Sidney, November 5, 1597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The next important tran&s;action we find Raleigh engaged in, was in 1601, when the unfortunate earl of E&s;&s;ex, who had calumniated him to the king of Scotland, and endeavoured all he could to &s;hake his intere&s;t, was &s;o ill advi&s;ed by his creatures, as to at|tempt a public in&s;urrection. Raleigh was active in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it: the earl pretended that the cau&s;e of his taking arms was to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the violence of his per&s;onal enemies, the lord Cobham and Raleigh having formed a de&s;ign of murdering him; tho' on the other hand it is pretty certain, that Sir Ferdinand Gorges, one of the earl's accomplices, afterwards accu&s;ed Sir Chri&s;topher Blount, another of them, for per&s;uading him to kill, or at lea&s;t ap|prehend, Sir Walter; which Gorges refu&s;ing, Blount di&s;charged four &s;hots after him in a boat. Blount acknowledged this, and at the time of his execution a&s;ked Sir Walter forgivene&s;s for it; which he readily granted,&mdash;While the earl gari&s;oned his hou&s;e, Sir Walter was one of tho&s;e who inve&s;ted it, and when his lord&s;hip was brought to his trial, he with forty of the queen's guard was pre&s;ent upon duty, and was likewi&s;e examined with relation to a confe|rence which he had upon the Thames the morning of

the in&s;urrection with Sir Ferdinando Gorges. At the execution of E&s;&s;ex, &s;ix days after, in the Tower, Raleigh attended, probably in his character of cap|tain of the guard, and &s;tood near the &s;caffold that he might the better an&s;wer if E&s;&s;ex &s;hould be de&s;irous of &s;peaking to him, but retired before the earl's execution, becau&s;e the people &s;eemed to take his appearance there in a wrong light; tho' he afterwards repented of it, as the earl expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to &s;ee and &s;peak with him before his death, which was in all probability to have a&s;ked Raleigh's forgivene&s;s for having traduced, and ca|lumniated him in order to colour his own ra&s;h de&s;igns.</P>
<P>In 1602 our author &s;old his e&s;tate in Ireland, to Mr. Boyle, afterwards earl of Cork, and about Mid|&s;ummer he &s;ettled his e&s;tate of Sherbone on his &s;on Walter, on account of a challenge which he had re|ceived from Sir Amias Pre&s;ton, who had been knighted at Cadiz by the earl of E&s;&s;ex; which challenge Sir Walter intended to accept, and there|fore di&s;po&s;ed his affairs in proper order. The cau&s;e of their quarrel does not appear, but they were af|terwards reconciled without proceeding to a duel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oldys, &s;ol. 167.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The death of Queen Elizabeth on the 24th of March 1602-3 proved a great misfortune to Ra|leigh; James her &s;ucce&s;&s;or having been prejudiced again&s;t him by the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who in&s;inuated that Raleigh was no friend to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, nor had any regard for his family. And the&s;e prejudices were heightened by &s;ecretary Cecil in his private corre&s;|pondence with that pu&s;ilanimous, jealous prince, be|fore he a&s;cended the Throne of England, or at lea&s;t immediately upon that event; for tho' Raleigh and Cecil had united again&s;t E&s;&s;ex, yet after the ruin of that earl and his party, their &s;eeming friend&s;hip terminated in a mutual &s;truggle for a &s;uperiority of
<PB N="191" REF="196">
power. But there is another important cau&s;e of James's di&s;gu&s;t to Sir Walter, which is, that he, lord Cobham, and Sir John Forte&s;cue, would have ob|liged the king to articles before he was admitted to the throne, and that the number of his countrymen &s;hould be limitted; which added to the circum&s;tance of Sir Walter's zeal to take off his mother, in&s;pired his maje&s;ty with a confirmed aver&s;ion to him; and indeed the tragical end of the queen of Scots is, per|haps, the greate&s;t error with which the annals of that glorious reign is &s;tained. Raleigh in vain endeavour|ed to gain the affection of the new king, which he attempted by transfering on &s;ecretary Cecil the blood of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, as well as that of his royal mo|ther; but this attempt to &s;ecure the affections of a weak prince, ended in his ruin, for it ex|a&s;perated Cecil the more again&s;t him; and as Sir Walter was of an active martial genius, the king, who was a lover of peace, and a natural coward, was affraid that &s;o military a man would involve him in a war, which he hated above all things in the world. Our author was &s;oon removed from his com|mand as captain of the guard, which was be&s;towed upon Sir Thomas Er&s;kin, his maje&s;ty's favourite as well as countryman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oldys, fol. 157.</NOTE>, the predece&s;&s;or to the earl of Mar, who&s;e actions, performed in the year 1715, are recent in every one's memory.</P>
<P>Not long after his maje&s;ty's a&s;cending the throne of England, Sir Walter was charged with a plot a|gain&s;t the king and royal family; but no clear e|vidence was ever produced that Raleigh had any concern in it. The plot was to have &s;urprized the king and court, to have created commotions in Scot|land, animated the di&s;contented in England, and ad|vanced Arabella Stuart, cou&s;in to the king, to the throne. Arabella was the daughter of lord Charles Stuart, younger brother to Henry lord Darnly, and
<PB N="192" REF="197">
&s;on to the duke of Lenox. She was afterwards married to William Seymour, &s;on to lord Beau|champ, and grand&s;on to the earl of Hertford; and both were confined for the pre&s;umption of marrying without his maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, from which they made their e&s;cape, but were again retaken. Lady Arabella died of grief, and Mr. Seymour lived to be a great favourite with Charles I. Raleigh per|&s;i&s;ted in avowing his ignorance of the plot, and when he came to his trial, he behaved him&s;elf &s;o pru|dently, and defended him&s;elf with &s;o much force, that the minds of the people pre&s;ent, who were at fir&s;t exa&s;perated again&s;t him, were turned from the &s;evere&s;t hatred to the tendere&s;t pity. Notwith|&s;tanding Sir Walter's proof that he was innocent of any &s;uch plot, and that lord Cobham, who had once accu&s;ed him had recanted, and &s;igned his recantation, nor was produced again&s;t him face to face, a pack'd jury brought him in guilty of high trea&s;on. Sentence of death being pronounced again&s;t him, he humbly reque&s;ted that the king might be made acquainted with the proofs upon which he was ca&s;t. He accompanied the She|riff to pri&s;on with wonderful magnanimity, tho' in a manner &s;uited to his unhappy &s;ituation. Raleigh was kept near a month at Winche&s;ter in daily expec|tation of death, and in a very pathetic letter wrote his la&s;t words to his wife the night before he expec|ted to &s;uffer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Raleigh's remains, vol. ii. p. 188.</NOTE>, in which he hoped his blood would quench their malice who had murdered him, and prayed God to forgive his per&s;ecutors, and accu&s;ers. The king &s;igned the warrant for the execution of the lords Cobham and Grey, and Sir Griffin Markham, at Winche&s;ter, pretending, &s;ays lord Cecil, to for|bear Sir Walter for the pre&s;ent, till lord Cobham's death had given &s;ome light how far he would make good his accu&s;ation. Markham was fir&s;t brought
<PB N="193" REF="198">
upon the &s;caffold, and when he was on his knees, ready to receive the blow of the ax, the groom of the bedchamber produced to the &s;heriff his ma|je&s;ty's warrant to &s;top the execution; and Markham was told that he mu&s;t withdraw a while into the hall to be confronted by the Lords. Then Lord Grey was brought forth, and having poured out his pray|ers and confe&s;&s;ion, was likewi&s;e called a&s;ide, and la&s;tly Lord Cobham was expo&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, and performed his devotions, though we do not find that he &s;aid one word of his guilt or innocence, or charged Raleigh with having in&s;ti|gated him; all which circum&s;tances &s;eem more than &s;ufficient to wipe off from the memory of Ra|leigh the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any plot again&s;t James's per&s;on or government.</P>
<P>He was remanded to the Tower of London with the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners, of whom Markham afterwards obtained his liberty, and travelled abroad. Lord Grey of Wilton died in the Tower; Lord Cobham was con&s;ined there many years, during which, it is &s;aid, he was examined by the King in re|lation to Raleigh, and entirely cleared him; he af|terwards died in the lowe&s;t circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In February following a grant was made by the King of all the goods and chattels forfeited by Sir Walter's conviction to the tru&s;tees of his appointing for the benefit of his creditors, la|dy and children. After 12 years confinement in the Tower, in March 1615 he was relea&s;ed out of it, by the interpo&s;ition of the favourite Buckingham; but before he quitted that place he &s;aw the earl of Somer&s;et committed there for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and afterwards condemned, which occa&s;ioned Sir Walter to com|pare his own ca&s;e with that of the carl's, and to remark, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the whole Hi&s;tory of the World had not the like precedent of a King's pri&s;on|er to purcha&s;e freedom, and his bo&s;om favourite

Sir Walter being now at large, had the means of pro&s;ecuting his old &s;cheme of &s;ettling Guiana, which he had &s;o much at heart, that even during his impri&s;onment, he held a con|&s;tant corre&s;pondence with that country, &s;ending thither every year, or every &s;econd year, a &s;hip, to keep the Indians in hopes of being relieved from the tyranny of the Spaniards, who had again en|croached upon them, and ma&s;&s;acred many, both of the inhabitants and of Raleigh's men. In the&s;e &s;hips were brought &s;everal natives of the country, with whom he conver&s;ed in the Tower, and obtained all po&s;&s;ible informations concerning it. Upon &s;uch in|formations he offered his &s;cheme for pro&s;ecuting his di&s;covery to the court before he undertook it in per|&s;on: nor were there any doubts either as to the improbability of the de&s;ign, or its unlawfulne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the peace made with Spain, other|wi&s;e the King would not have made &s;uch grants as he did, even at that time, which &s;hews that he was then convinced, that Sir Walter had in his fir&s;t voyage di&s;covered and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that coun|try for the crown of England, and con&s;equently that his &s;ubjects were ju&s;tly intitled to any bene|fits that might ari&s;e from its di&s;covery, without the lea&s;t re&s;pect to the preten&s;ions of the Spa|niards: Be&s;ides, when Sir Walter fir&s;t moved the court upon this &s;ubject, the Spani&s;h match was not thought of, and the King's nece&s;&s;ities being then very pre&s;&s;ing, he may be pre&s;umed to have conceived great hopes from that di&s;covery, though he might afterwards change his opinion,
<PB N="195" REF="200">
when he grew &s;o unrea&s;onably fond of that match.</P>
<P>In 1616 he obtained a royal commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle Guiana at the expence of him&s;elf and his friends; he was appointed General, and Commander in Chief of this enterprize, and Governor of the new country, which he was to &s;ettle with ample authority; a power was granted him too, of exer|ci&s;ing martial law in &s;uch a manner as the King's Lieutenant General by &s;ea or land, or any Lieu|tenants of the counties of England had. The&s;e powers &s;eem to imply a virtual pardon to Raleigh, and perhaps made him le&s;s &s;olicitous for an actual one. Meantime Gondemar the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dor, by his addre&s;s, vivacity, and flattering the humours of James, had gained a great a&s;cendency over him, and began to make a great clamour a|bout Raleigh's preparations, and from that mo|ment formed &s;chemes of de&s;troying him. The whole expence of this expedition was defrayed by Raleigh and his friends; the fleet con&s;i&s;ted of about &s;even &s;ail. On the 17th of November, 1617, they came in &s;ight of Guiana, and &s;oon after to an|chor, in five degrees off the river Caliana, where they remained till the 4th of December. Raleigh was received with great joy by the Indians, who not only a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with provi&s;ions, and every thing el&s;e in their power, but offered him the &s;o|vereignty of their country if he would &s;ettle a|mong&s;t them, which he declined to accept<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter to his lady from Caliana, November 14, 1617.</NOTE>. His extreme &s;ickne&s;s for &s;ix weeks prevented him from undertaking the di&s;covery of the mines in per&s;on, and was obliged to depute captain Keymis to that &s;ervice; and accordingly on the 4th of December, ordered five &s;mall &s;hips to &s;ail into the river Oro|noque. When they landed, they found a Spani&s;h garri&s;on between them and the mine, which &s;ally|ing out unexpectedly, put them in confu&s;ion, and 
<PB N="196" REF="201">
gave them lattle. In this conflict young Raleigh was killed, and by a fatal mi&s;take, captain Keymis did not prove the mine, but burnt and plundered the Spani&s;h garri&s;on, and found among&s;t the gover|nor's papers one, which informed him, that Raleigh's expedition had been betrayed, and that he was to be &s;acrificed to the Spaniards. Upon Keymis's un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, Raleigh &s;harply rebuked him for his mi&s;take, and a deviation from his orders, which &s;o much affected that capta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n, that he &s;hot him&s;elf in his own cabbin, and finding the wound not mortal, he fini&s;hed his de&s;ign by a long knife with which he &s;tabbed him&s;elf to the heart. In this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation Raleigh returned home, and found on his arrival at Plymouth, a declaration publi&s;hed again&s;t him; at which he took the alarm, and contrived to convey him&s;elf out of the kingdom in a ve&s;&s;el hired for that purpo&s;e by an old officer of his; but changing his opinion in that re&s;pect, he proceeded in his journey to London.</P>
<P>Yet thinking it proper to gain time for the appea&s;ing his maje&s;ty, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uric a French quack, he counterfeited &s;ick|ne&s;s for &s;everal days, during which he wrote his apology. However on the 7th of Augu&s;t he arriv|ed at London, where he was con&s;ined in his own hou&s;e; but having &s;till good rea&s;ons not to tru&s;t him&s;elf to the mercy of the court, he formed a de|&s;ign to e&s;cape into France, which Sir Lewis Stack|ley, who was privy to, and encouraged it, di&s;co|vered, and Sir Walter being &s;eized in a beat upon the river below Woolwich, was a &s;econd time, on the 10th of Augu&s;t, committed to the Tower; but tho' his death &s;eemed ab&s;olutely determined, yet it &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">med difficult to find a method of accompli&s;hing it, &s;ince his conduct in the late expedition could not be &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tched in law to &s;uch a &s;entence. It was re|&s;olved therefore, to &s;acrifice him to the re&s;entment of Spain, in a manner &s;o &s;hameful, that it has ju&s;tly
<PB N="197" REF="202">
expo&s;ed the conduct of the court to the indignation of all &s;ucceeding ages, and tran&s;mitted the pu&s;illa|nimous monarch with infamy to po&s;terity. They called him down to judgment upon his former &s;en|tence pa&s;&s;ed fifteen years before, which they were not then a&s;hamed to execute. A privy &s;eal was &s;ent to the judges to order immediate execution, on which a conference was held Friday the 24th of Oct. 1688, between all the judges of England, concerning the manner, how pri&s;oners who have been attaint|ed of trea&s;on and &s;et at liberty, &s;hould be brought to execution. In con&s;equence of their re&s;olution, a privy &s;eal came to the King's-Bench, commanding that court to proceed again&s;t Sir Walter according to law, who next day received notice of the coun|cil to prepare him&s;elf for death; and on Wedne&s;|day the 28th of that month, at 8 o'clock in the morn|ing, was taken out of bed in the hot fit of an ague, and carried to the King's-Bench, We&s;tmin&s;ter, where execution was awarded again&s;t him. The next morning, the 29th of October, the day of the lord|mayor's inauguration, a &s;olemnity never perhaps at|tended before with a public execution, Sir Walter was conducted by the &s;heriffs of Middle&s;ex to the Old Palace Yard in We&s;tmin&s;ter, where mounting the &s;caffold, he behaved with the mo&s;t undaunted &s;pirit, and &s;eeming cheerfulne&s;s.

This verifies the noble ob|&s;ervation of Shake&s;pear, that all heroes have a con|tempt of death; which he puts in the mouth of Julius Cae&s;ar when his friends di&s;&s;uaded him from going to the Senate-Hou&s;e.<Q><L><PB N="198" REF="203">

<P>Sir Walter eat his breakfa&s;t that morning, &s;moak|ed his pipe, and made no more of death, than if he had been to take a journey. On the &s;caffold he conver&s;ed freely with the Earl of Arundel and others of the nobility, and vindicated him&s;elf from two &s;u&s;picions; the fir&s;t, of entering into a confederacy with France; the &s;econd, of &s;peaking di&s;loyally of his Maje&s;ty. He cleared him&s;elf likewi&s;e of the &s;u&s;picion of having per&s;ecuted the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, or of in&s;ulting him at his death. He concluded with de&s;iring the good people to join with him in prayer, to that great God of Heaven, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whom (&s;ays he) I have grievou&s;ly offended, being a man full of vanity, who has lived a &s;inful life, in &s;uch callings as have been mo&s;t inducing to it: For I have been a &s;oldier, a &s;ailor, and a courtier; which are cour&s;es of wickedne&s;s and vice."</Q> The proclamation being made that all men &s;hould de|part the &s;caffold, he prepared him&s;elf for death, gave away his hat and cap, and money to &s;ome attendants that &s;tood near him.

His body was interred in the chancel of St. Margaret's Church, We&s;tmin&s;ter, but his head was long pre&s;erved in a ca&s;e by his widow, who &s;urvived him twenty-years.</P>
<P>Thus fell Sir Walter Raleigh in the 66th year of his age, a &s;acrifice to a contemptible admini&s;tration, and the re&s;entment of a mean prince: A man of &s;o great abilities, that neither that nor the preceding reign produced his equal. His character was a combination of almo&s;t every eminent quality; he was the &s;oldier, &s;tate&s;men, and &s;cholar united, and had he lived with the heroes of antiquity, he would have made a ju&s;t parallel to Cae&s;ar, and Xenophon, like them being equal ma&s;ter of the &s;word and the pen. One circum&s;tance mu&s;t not be omitted, which in a life &s;o full of action as his, is &s;omewhat extraordinary, viz. that whe|ther he was on board his &s;hips upon important and arduous expeditions, bu&s;y in court tran|&s;actions, or pur&s;uing &s;chemes of plea&s;ure, he ne|ver failed to dedicate at lea&s;t four hours every day to &s;tudy, by which he became &s;o much ma&s;|ter of all knowledge, and was enabled, as a poet beautifully expre&s;&s;es it, to enrich the world with

<HEAD>Dr. JOHN DONNE,</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent poet, and divine of the la&s;t century, was born in London in the year 1573. His fa|ther was a merchant, de&s;cended from a very anci|ent family in Wales, and his mother from Sir Tho|mas More. Chancellor of England. He was educa|ted in his father's hou&s;e under a tutor till the 11th year of his age, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Walton's Life of Donne.</NOTE> when he was &s;ent to Oxford; at which time it was ob&s;erved of him, as of the famous Pica Mirandula, that he was rather born wi&s;e than made &s;o by &s;tudy. He was admitted commoner of Harthall, together with his younger brother, in
<PB N="203" REF="208">
Michaelmas term 1584<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood vol. 1. col. 554.</NOTE>. By advice of his relati|ons, who were Roman Catholics, he declined tak|ing the oath tendered upon the occa&s;ion of taking degrees. After he had &s;tudied three years at the Univer&s;ity, he removed to Cambridge, and from thence three years after to Lincoln's-Inn. About this time his father died, and left him a portion of 3000 l. He became &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed at Lincoln's-Inn, by his rapid progre&s;s in the law. He was now eighteen years of age, and as yet had attached him|&s;elf to no particular denomination of Chri&s;tians, and as his relations were bigotted to the Romi&s;h faith, he was induced to examine the controver&s;y, and to em|brace publickly that which appeared to him to be be&s;t &s;upported by the authority of the &s;crip|tures. He relinqui&s;hed the &s;tudy of the law, and devoted him&s;elf entirely to that of the con|troverted points between the Prote&s;tants and Catho|lics, which ended in a thorough conviction of the truths of the reformed religion.</P>
<P>In the years 1596 and 1597 Mr. Donne attended the Earl of E&s;&s;ex in his expeditions again&s;t Cadiz and the Azores-I&s;lands, and &s;tayed &s;ome years in Italy and Spain, and &s;oon after his return to Eng|land he was made &s;ecretary to lord chancellor Egerton. This probably was intended by his lord&s;hip only as an introduction to a more dignified place; for he frequently expre&s;&s;ed a high opinion of his &s;ecretary's abilities; and when he afterwards, by the &s;ollicitation of his lady, parted with him, he ob&s;erved that he was fitter to be a &s;ecretary to a Monarch than to him. When he was in the lord chancellor's family, he married pri|vately without the con&s;ent of her father, the daughter of Sir George More, chancellor of the Garter, and lord lieutenant of the Tower, who &s;o much re&s;ented his daughter's marriage without his
<PB N="204" REF="209">
con&s;ent, that he procured our author's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the chancellor's &s;ervice, and got him committed to pri&s;on. Sir George's daughter lived in the lord chancellor's family, and was niece to his lady.</P>
<P>Upon Sir George's hearing that his daughter had engaged her heart to Donne, he removed her to his own hou&s;e in Surry, and friends on both &s;ides endeavoured to weaken their affection for each other, but without &s;ucce&s;s; for having exchanged the mo&s;t &s;acred promi&s;es, they found means to con|&s;ummate a private marriage. Our author was not long in obtaining his liberty, but was obliged to be at the expence of a tedious law-&s;uit to recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his wife, who was forcibly detained from him. At length our poet's extraordinary me|rit and winning behaviour &s;o far &s;ubdued Sir George's re&s;entment, that he u&s;ed his intere&s;t with the Chan|cellor to have his &s;on-in-law re&s;tored to his place; but this reque&s;t was refu&s;ed; his lord&s;hip ob&s;erving, that he did not chu&s;e to di&s;charge and re-admit &s;er|vants at the reque&s;t of his pa&s;&s;ionate petitioners. Sir George had been &s;o far reconciled to his daughter and &s;on, as not to deny his paternal ble&s;&s;ing, but would contribute nothing towards their &s;upport, Mr. Donne's fortune being greatly dimini&s;hed by the expence of travels, law-&s;uits, and the genero|&s;ity of his temper; however his wants were in a great mea&s;ure prevented by the &s;ea&s;onable bounty of their kin&s;man Sir Francis Wooley, who enter|tained them &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al years at his hou&s;e at Pilford in Surry, where our author had &s;everal children born to him. During his re&s;idence at Pilford he applied him&s;elf with great diligence and &s;ucce&s;s to the &s;tudy of the civil and canon law, and was about this time &s;ollicited by Dr. Morton, (afterwards lord bi&s;hop of Durham) to go into holy Orders, and accept of a Benefice the Doctor would have re&s;igned to him; but he thought proper to refu&s;e this obliging offer. He lived with Sir Francis
<PB N="205" REF="210">
till that gentleman's death, by who&s;e mediation a perfect reconciliation was effected between Mr. Donne and his father-in-law; who obliged him&s;elf to pay our author 800 l. at a certain day as his wife's portion, or 20 l. quarterly for their main|tenance, till it was all paid.</P>
<P>He was incorporated ma&s;ter of arts in the uni|ver&s;ity of Oxford, having before taken the &s;ame degree at Cambridge 1610.</P>
<P>About two years after the reconciliation with his father, he was prevailed upon with much difficulty to accompany Sir Robert Drury to Paris<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Walton p. 29.</NOTE>. Mrs. Donne, being then big with child and in a langui&s;h|ing &s;tate of health, &s;trongly oppo&s;ed his departure, telling him, that her divining &s;oul boaded &s;ome ill in his ab&s;ence; but Sir Robert's importunity was not to be re&s;i&s;ted, and he at la&s;t con&s;ented to go with him. Mr. Walton gives an account of a vi&s;ion Mr. Donne had &s;een after their arrival there, which he &s;ays was told him by a per&s;on of honour, who had a great intimacy with Mr. Donne; and as it has in it &s;omething curious enough, I &s;hall here pre&s;ent it to the reader in that author's own words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life ubi &s;upra p. 52.</NOTE>. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Two days after their arrival there, Mr. Donne was left alone in that room in which Sir Robert and he and &s;ome other friends had dined toge|ther.

To which Sir Robert replied, &s;ure Sir, you have &s;lept &s;ince you &s;aw me, and this is the re&s;ult of &s;ome melancholy dream, which I de&s;ire you to forget, for you are now awake. To which Mr. Donne's reply was: I cannot be &s;urer that I now live, than that I have not &s;lept &s;ince I &s;aw you; and am as &s;ure that at her &s;econd ap|pearing &s;he &s;topt and looked me in the face and vani&s;hed."</Q> Re&s;t and &s;leep had not altered Mr. Donne's opinion next day, for then he confirmed his vi&s;ion with &s;o deliberate a confidence, that he in|clined Sir Robert to a faint belief that the vi&s;ion was true. It is an ob&s;ervation, that de&s;ire and doubt have no re&s;t, for he immediately &s;ent a &s;ervant to Drury-Hou&s;e, with a charge to ha&s;ten back and bring him word <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whether Mrs. Donne was dead or alive, and if alive in what condition &s;he was as to her health."</Q> The twel&s;th day the me&s;&s;enger re|turned with this account; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he found and left Mrs. Donne very &s;ad and &s;ick in her bed; and that after a long and dangerous labour &s;he had been delivered of a dead child, and upon exami|nation the birth proved to be on the &s;ame day, and about the very hour Mr. Donne affirmed he &s;aw her pa&s;s by him in his chamber."</Q>&mdash;After Donne's return from France. many of the nobility pre&s;&s;ed the King to confer &s;ome &s;ecular employment upon him; but his Maje&s;ty, who con&s;idered him as better qualified for the &s;ervice of the church than the &s;tate, rejected their reque&s;ts, tho' the Earl of Somer|&s;et, then the great favourite, joined in petitioning for his preferment. About this time the di&s;putes concerning the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy being: gitated. Mr. Donne by his Maje&s;ty's &s;pecial command, wrote a treati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e on that &s;ubject, entitled, P&s;eudo Martyr, printed in 4to, 1610, with which his
<PB N="207" REF="212">
his Maje&s;ty was highly plea&s;ed, and being firmly re&s;olved to promote him in the church, he pre&s;&s;ed him to enter into holy orders, but he being re&s;olved to qualify him&s;elf the better for the &s;acred office by &s;tudying divinity, and the learned languages de|ferred his entering upon it three years longer, dur|ing which time he made a vigorous application to the&s;e branches of knowledge, and was then or|dained both deacon and prie&s;t, by Dr. John King, then bi&s;hop of London. Pre&s;ently after he was ap|pointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to his Ma|je&s;ty, and about the &s;ame time attending the King in a progre&s;s, he was created Dr. in divinity, by the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, by the particular re|commendation of that Prince<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walton, p. 39, 41.</NOTE>. His abilities and indu&s;try in his profe&s;&s;ion were &s;o eminent, and him&s;elf &s;o well beloved, that within the fir&s;t year of his entering into holy orders, he had the offer of fourteen benefices from per&s;ons of quali|ty, but as they lay in the country, his inclination of living in London, made him refu&s;e them all. Upon his return from Cambridge his wife died, and his grief for her lo&s;s was &s;o great, that for &s;ome time he betook him&s;elf to a retired and &s;olitary life: Mrs. Donne died in the year 1617, on the &s;e|venth day after the birth of her twelfth child. She left our author in a narrow un&s;ettled &s;tate with &s;even children then living, to her he gave a vo|luntary a&s;&s;urance, that he would never bring them under the &s;ubjection of a &s;tep-mother, and this promi&s;e he faithfully kept. Soon after the death of his wife, he was cho&s;en preacher of Lincoln's Inn, and in the year 1619 appointed by King James to attend the earl of Donca&s;ter, in his emba&s;&s;y to the Princes of Germany, and about 14 months af|ter his return to England, he was advanced to the deanery of St. Paul's. Upon the vacancy of the

'Till the 59th year of his age he continued in perfect health, when being with his elde&s;t daughter in E&s;&s;ex, in 1630, he was taken ill of a fever, which brought on a con&s;ump|tion; notwith&s;tanding which he returned to London, and preached in his turn at court as u&s;ual, on the fir&s;t friday in Lent. He died on the 31&s;t day of March 1631, and was buried in the cathedral church of St. Paul's, where a monument wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> erect|ed over him. Walton &s;ays that among&s;t other pre|parations for death, he made u&s;e of this very re|markable one. He ordered an urn to be cut in wood, on which was to be placed a board of the exact heighth of his body: this being done, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be tied up in a winding &s;heet in the &s;ame manner that dead bodies are. Being thus &s;hrouded, and &s;tanding with his eyes &s;hut, and with ju&s;t &s;o much of the &s;heet put a&s;ide, as might di&s;|cover his thin pale, and death like face, he cau&s;ed a &s;kilful painter to draw his picture. This piece being fini&s;hed, was placed near his bed-&s;ide, and there remained as his con&s;tant remembrancer to the hour of his death.</P>
<P>His character as a preacher and a poet are &s;uffi|ciently &s;een in his incomparable writings. His per|&s;onal
<PB N="209" REF="214">
qualifications were as eminent as tho&s;e of his mind; he was by nature exceeding pa&s;&s;ionate, but was apt to be &s;orry for the exce&s;&s;es of it, and like mo&s;t other pa&s;&s;ionate men, was humane and bene|volent. His monument was compo&s;ed of white marble, and carved from the picture ju&s;t now men|tioned of him, by order of his executor Dr. King, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who wrote the following in|&s;cription,<Q>Johannes Donne, S.

A little village called Har&s;ul in that county claims the honour of his birth, by which accident it is rai&s;ed from ob&s;curity; he was born in the year 1593, according to the mo&s;t accurate computation that can be made from the dates of his works. When he was but very young he gave &s;uch di&s;coveries of a ri&s;ing genius as rendered him a favourite with his tutors, and procured him the patronage of per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. In the year 1573, being then but about ten years of age, he was page to &s;ome honoura|ble per&s;on, as may be collected from his own words: In &s;ome of his epi&s;tles to Henry Reynold e&s;quire, it appears that even then he could con&s;true his Cato, and &s;ome other little collections of &s;en|tences, which made him very anxious to know, what &s;ort of beings the poets were, and very pre&s;&s;|ing upon his tutor to make him, if po&s;&s;ible, a po|et. In con&s;equence of this he was put to the read|ing of Virgil's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">clogues, and 'till even then, &s;ays one of his Biographers, he &s;corned any thing that looked like a ballad, though written by El|derton him&s;elf. This Elderton was a famous co|median in tho&s;e days, and a facetious companion, who having a great readine&s;s at rhiming, com|po&s;ed many catches on Love and Wine, which
<PB N="213" REF="218">
were then in great vogue among the giddy and vo|latile part of the town; but he was not more ce|lebrated for drollory than drinking, &s;o that he ob|tained the name of the bacchanalian buffoon, the red-no&s;ed ballad-maker, &amp;c. and at la&s;t by the exce&s;&s;ive indulgence of his favourite vice, he fell a martyr to it 1592, and Mr. Camden has pre&s;erv|ed this epitaph on him, which for its humour, I &s;hall here give a place.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">
<L>Dead drunk, here Elderton does lie;</L>
<L>Dead as he is, he &s;till is drie.</L>
<L>So of him it may well be &s;aid,</L>
<L>Here he, but not his thir&s;t, is laid.</L>

<P>If after this our author did not fini&s;h his edu|cation at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, it is evident from the te&s;timony of Sir A&s;ton Cohain, his in|timate friend, who mentions him in his Choice Poems of &s;everal Sorts, that he was for &s;ome time a &s;tudent at Oxford; however, he is not taken no|tice of by Wood, who has commemorated the mo&s;t part of the writers who were educated there. In 1588 it-appears from his poem, entitled Mo&s;es his Birth and Miracles, that he was a &s;pectator at Dover of the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, which was arro|gantly &s;tiled Invincible, and it is not improbable that he was engaged in &s;ome military employment there, e&s;pecially as we &s;ind &s;ome mention made of him, as being in e&s;teem with the gentlemen of the army. He early addicted him&s;elf to the amu&s;e|ment of poetry, but all who have written of him, have been negligent in informing us how &s;oon he favoured the public with any production of his own. He was di&s;tingui&s;hed as a poet about nine or ten years before the death of Queen Elizabeth, but at what time he began to publi&s;h cannot be a&s;certained. In the year 1593, when he was but 30 years of age, he publi&s;hed a collection of his Pa&s;to|rals;
<PB N="214" REF="219">
likewi&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t grave poems, and &s;uch as have tran&s;mitted his name to po&s;terity with honour, not long after &s;aw the light. His Baron's wars, and England's heroical Epi&s;tles; his Down|fals of Robert of Normandy; Matilda and Ga|ve&s;ton, for which la&s;t he is called by one of his cotemporaries, Tragaediographus, and part of his Polyo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">bion were written before the year 1598, for all which joined with his per&s;onal good character, he was highly celebrated at that time, not only for the elegance and &s;weetne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ions, but his actions and manners, which were uniformly vir|tuous and honourable; he was thus characteri&s;ed not only by the poets, and florid writers of tho&s;e days, but al&s;o by divines, hi&s;torians, and other &s;cho|lars of the mo&s;t &s;erious turn and exten&s;ive learn|ing. In his younger years he was much beloved and patronized by Sir Walter A&s;ton of Tixhall in Stafford&s;hire, to whom for his kind protection, he gratefully dedicates many of his poems, whereof his Barons Wars was the fir&s;t, in the &s;pring of his acquaintance, as Drayton him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it; but however, it may be gathered from his works, that his mo&s;t early dependance was upon another pa|tron, namel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, Sir Henry Goodere of Pole&s;worth, in his own county, to whom he has been grateful for a great part of his education, and by whom he was recommended to the patronage of the counte&s;s of Bedford: it is no le&s;s plain from many of his dedications to Sir Walter A&s;ton, that he was for many years &s;upported by him, and accommodated with &s;uch &s;upplies as afforded him lei&s;ure to fini&s;h &s;ome of his mo&s;t elaborate compo&s;itions; and the author of the Biographia Britannicahas told us, 'that it has been alledged, that he was by the intere&s;t of the &s;ame gentleman with Sir Roger A&s;hton, one of the Bedchamber to King James in his mino|rity, made in &s;ome mea&s;ure mini&s;terial to an inter|cour&s;e of corre&s;pondence between the young King
<PB N="215" REF="220">
of Scots and Queen Elizabeth:' but as no authority is produced to prove this, it is probably without foundation, as poets have &s;eldom inclination, acti|vity or &s;teadine&s;s to manage any &s;tate affairs, parti|cularly a point of &s;o delicate a nature.</P>
<P>Our author certainly had fair pro&s;pects, from his &s;ervices, or other te&s;timonies of early attachment to the King's intere&s;t, of &s;ome preferment, be&s;ides he had written Sonnets, in prai&s;e of the King as a po|et. Thus we &s;ee Drayton de&s;cending to &s;ervile flattery to promote his intere&s;t, and prai&s;ing a man as a poet contrary to his own judgment, becau&s;e he was a King who was as devoid of poetry as courage.</P>
<P>He welcomed his Maje&s;ty to his Briti&s;h dominions with a congratulatory poem printed in 4to, 1603.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year he was cho&s;en by Sir Walter A&s;ton one of the e&s;quires who attended him, when he was with others created knight of the Bath at the coronation of his Maje&s;ty. It no where appears that ever our author printed tho&s;e poems in prai&s;e of his Maje&s;ty; and the ungrateful reception they met, as well as the di&s;agreeable experience of the univer&s;al degeneracy at court, &s;o different from that of the Maiden Reign, might extingui&s;h all hope of rai&s;ing him&s;elf there.</P>
<P>In the year 1613 he publi&s;hed the fir&s;t part of his Poly-olbion. It is a chorographical de&s;cription of the rivers, mountains, fore&s;ts, ca&s;tles, &amp;c. in this I&s;land, intermixed with the remarkable antiquities, rarities, commodities, &amp;c. This part is addre&s;&s;ed to Prince Henry, the promi&s;ing &s;on of James I. by who&s;e encouragement it was written. He had &s;hewed Drayton &s;ome &s;ingular marks of his favour. and &s;eems to have admitted him as one of his poetical pen&s;ioners, but dying before the book was fini&s;hed, he lo&s;t the benefit of his patronage, In this volume there are eighteen &s;ongs, illu&s;tra|ted with the notes of the learned Mr. Selden, and there are maps before every &s;ong, whereby
<PB N="216" REF="221">
the cities, mountains, fore&s;ts, rivers, &amp;c. are re|pre&s;ented by the figures of men and women. It is interwoven with many epi&s;odes, &s;uch as the conque&s;t of this I&s;land by the Romans, the ar|rival of the Saxons, the Danes and Normans, &amp;c. And bi&s;hop Nichol&s;on ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">erves, that Poly-olbion affords a much more accurate account of this kingdom and the Dominion of Wales than could have been expected from the pen of a poet. How poetically our author has conducted and executed his plan, is admirably expre&s;&s;ed by the ingenious Dr. James Kirkpatrick, in a beautiful poem of his called the Sea-Piece. Canto II. which I can|not here omit tran&s;cribing.<Q><L>Drayton, &s;weet ancient bard, his Albion &s;ung,</L>

<L>His bounding mu&s;e o'er every mountain rode,</L>
<L>And ev'ry river warbled where he flow'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>In 1619 came out his fir&s;t folio volume of poems, In 1622 the &s;econd part of his Poly-olbion was publi&s;hed, making in all thirty books or &s;ongs. In 1622 we find him &s;tiled Poet Laureat: It is pro|bable this appellation of Poet Laureat was not con|fined and re&s;tricted as it is now to his Maje&s;ty's Ser|vant known by that title, who at that time it is pre|&s;umed was Ben John&s;on, becau&s;e it was be&s;towed promi&s;cuou&s;ly as a mark of any poet's excellency in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In 1627 was publi&s;hed the &s;econd volume of his poems, containing the battle of Agencourt, in &s;tan|zas of eight lines. The my&s;teries of Queen Mar|garet in the like &s;tanzas. Nymphidia, or the Court of Faeries. The Que&s;t of Cynthia, another beauti|ful piece, both reprinted in Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies. The Shepherd's Sirena; al&s;o the Moon Calf; Sa|tire on the Ma&s;culine Affectations of Women, and
<PB N="217" REF="222">
the effeminate di&s;gui&s;es of the Men, in tho&s;e times. Elegies upon &s;everal occa&s;ions. The&s;e are intro|duced by the vi&s;ion of Ben John&s;on on the Mu&s;e of his friend Michael Drayton, wherein he very parti|cularly enumerates and prai&s;es his &s;everal compo&s;i|tions. In 1630 he publi&s;hed another volume of poems in 4to, intitled the Mu&s;es Elizium, in ten &s;undry Nymphals, with three different poems on Noah's flood; Mo&s;es his birth and miracles, and David and Goliah. The pa&s;toral poems are addre&s;|&s;ed to Edward Sackville Earl of Dor&s;et, and Lord Chamberlain, who had now made him one of his family. His divine poems are written in ver&s;e and various mea&s;ures, and are dedicated to the Counte&s;s of Dor&s;et; and there are &s;ome &s;ublime images in them. At the end of the fir&s;t divine poem, there are copies of ver&s;es in prai&s;e of the author, by Beal Sapperton, in Latin; Mr. John Fletcher, and Tho|mas Andrews in Engli&s;h; the la&s;t of whom is very lavi&s;h in di&s;playing the great extent of our poet's fame.</P>
<P>In 1631 Mr. Drayton died, or as it is expre&s;&s;ed in his monumental in&s;cription, exchanged his laurel for a crown of glory. He was buried among the poets in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, and the hand&s;ome ta|ble monument of blue marble which was rai&s;ed o|ver his grave the &s;ame year, is adorned with his ef|figies in bu&s;to, laureated. On one &s;ide is a cre&s;t of Minerva's cap, and Pega&s;us in a &s;cutcheon on the other. Sir A&s;ton Cokain compo&s;ed an elegy upon him: and Ben John&s;on is &s;aid to have been the author of his epitaph, which is written in let|ters of gold upon his monument, with which I &s;hall here pre&s;ent the reader.<Q><LG TYPE="epitaph">

<P>Mr. Drayton enjoyed the friend&s;hip and admirati|on of contemporary wits, and Ben John&s;on who was not much di&s;po&s;ed to prai&s;e, entertained a high opi|nion of him, and in this epitaph has both immor|talized him&s;elf and his friend. It is ea&s;y for tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with our author's works to &s;ee how much the moderns and even Mr. Pope him&s;elf copy Mr. Drayton, and refine upon him in tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which are e&s;teemed the mo&s;t delicate im|provements of our Engli&s;h ver&s;ification, &s;uch as the turns, the pau&s;es, the elegant tautologies, &amp;c. It is not difficult to point out &s;ome depredations which have been made on our author by modern writers, however ob&s;olete &s;ome of them may have reckoned him. In one of his heroical epi&s;tles, that of King John to Matilda, he has the following lines.<Q><L>Th' Arabian bird which never is but one,</L>
<L>Is only cha&s;t becau&s;e &s;he is alone,</L>

<P>The&s;e are a&s;cribed to the Earl of Roche&s;ter, who was unexceptionably a great wit.

He was ho|noured with the patronage of men of worth, tho' not of the highe&s;t &s;tations; and that author cannot be called a mean one, on whom &s;o great a man as Selden (in many re&s;pects the mo&s;t fini&s;hed &s;cholar that ever appeared in our nation) was plea&s;ed to animadvert. His genius &s;eems to have been of the &s;econd rate, much beneath Spencer and Sidney, Shake&s;pear and John&s;on, but highly removed a|bove the ordinary run of ver&s;ifyers. We &s;hall quote a few lines from his Poly-olbion as a &s;pecimen of his poetry.</P>
<P>When he &s;peaks of his native county, Warwick|&s;hire, he has the following lines;<Q><L>Upon the mid-lands now, th' indu&s;trious Mu&s;e doth fall,</L>

<P>WAS &s;on of Mr. Vincent Corbet, and born at Ewelb in Surry, in the reign of Queen Eli|zabeth. He was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and from thence was &s;ent to Oxford, 1597, where he was admitted a &s;tudent in Chri&s;t-church. In 1605, being then e&s;teemed one of the greate&s;t wits of the Univer&s;ity, he took the degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts, and afterwards entering into holy orders, he became a popular preacher, and much admired by people of ta&s;te and learning. His &s;hining wit, and remark|able eloquence recommended him to King James I. who made him one of his chaplains in ordinary, and in 1620 promoted him to the deanery of Chri&s;t's-church; about which time he was made doctor of divinity, vicar of Ca&s;&s;ington, near Wood|&s;tock, in Oxford&s;hire, and prebendary of Bed-min&s;ter-&s;ecunda, in the church of Sarum.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Athen.

<P>While he was dean of Chri&s;t's church, he made ver&s;es on a play acted before the King at Wood&s;tock, called Technogamia, or the marriage of Arts, writ|ten by Barten Holiday the poet, who afterwards tran&s;lated Juvenal.

When in the year 1634 St. Paul's cathedral was repaired, he not only con|tributed him&s;elf, but was very diligent in procuring contributions from others.

<HEAD>EDWARD FAIRFAX.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the biographers of the poets have been extremely negligent with re&s;pect to this great genias. Philips &s;o far overlooks him, that he crowds him into his &s;upplement, and Win&s;tanley, who &s;ol|lowed him, po&s;tpones our author till after the Earl of Roche&s;ter. Sir Thomas Pope Blount makes no mention of him; and Mr. Jacob, &s;o ju&s;tly called the Blunderbus of Law, informs us he wrote in the time of Charles the fir&s;t, tho' he dedicates his tran|&s;lation of Ta&s;&s;o to Queen Elizabeth. All who menti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n him, do him the ju&s;tice to allow he was an accompli&s;hed genius, but then it is in a way &s;o cool and indifferent, as &s;hews that they had ne|ver read his works, or were any way charmed with the melody of his ver&s;es. It was impo&s;&s;ible Mr. Dryden could be &s;o blind to our author's beauties; accordingly we find him introducing Spen&s;er and Fairfax almo&s;t on the level, as the leading authors of their times; nay tacitly yielding the palm in point of harmony to the la&s;t; by a&s;&s;erting that Waller confe&s;&s;ed he owed the mu&s;ic of his numbers to Fairfax's Godfrey of Bulloign. The truth is, this gentleman is per|haps the only writer down to Sir William Dave|nant, who needs no apology to be made for him, on account of the age in which he lived&punc; His diction is &s;o pure, elegant, and full of graces, and the turn of his lines &s;o perfectly melodious, that one cannot read it without rapture; and we can

&s;carcely imagine the original Italian has greatly the advantage in either, nor is it very probable that while Fairfax can be read, any author will attempt a new tran&s;lation of Ta&s;&s;o with &s;ucce&s;s.

<HEAD>THOMAS RANDOLPH,</HEAD>
<P>A Poet of no mean genius, was born at Newn|ham, near Daintry in Northampton&s;hire, the 15th of June, 1605; he was &s;on of William Randolph of Hams, near Lewes in Su&s;&s;ex, was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, and went from thence to Trinity College in Cambridge, 1623, of which he became a fellow; he commenced Ma&s;ter of Arts, and in this degree was incorporated at Oxon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athan. Oxon. p. 224.</NOTE>, became famous (&s;ays Wood) for his inge|nuity, being the adopted &s;on of Ben John&s;on, and accounted one of the mo&s;t pregnant wits of his age. The quickne&s;s of his parts was di&s;covered early; when he was about nine or ten years old he wrote the Hi&s;tory of the Incarnation of Our Saviour in ver&s;e, which is pre&s;erved in manu|&s;cript under his own hand writing. Randolph receives from Langbaine the highe&s;t encomium. He tells his readers that they need expect no di&s;co|veries of thefts, for this author had no occa&s;ion to practi&s;e plagiary, having &s;o large a fund of wit of his own, that he needed not to borrow from others. Were a foreigner to form a notion of the merit of the Engli&s;h poets from reading Lang|baine, they would be in raptures with Randolph and Durfey, and others of their cla&s;s, while Dry|den, and the fir&s;t-rate wits, would be quite neglect|ed: Langbaine is &s;o far generous, that he does all he can to draw ob&s;cure men into light, but then he
<PB N="227" REF="232">
cannot be acquitted of envy, for endeavouring to &s;hade the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e who&s;e genius has broke through ob&s;curity without his means, and he does no &s;ervice to his country while he confines his pa|negyric to mean ver&s;ifiers, whom no body can read without a certain degree of contempt.</P>
<P>Our author had done nothing in life it &s;eems worth pre&s;erving, or at lea&s;t that cotemporary hi&s;to|rians thought &s;o, for there is little to be learned concerning him. Wood &s;ays he was like other poets, much addicted to libertine indulgence, and by being too free with his con&s;titution in the com|pany of his admirers, and running into fa&s;hion|able exce&s;&s;es, he was the means of &s;hortening his own days. He died at little Haughton in Nor|thampton&s;hire, and was buried in an i&s;le ad|joining to the church in that place, on the 17th of March, 1634. He had &s;oon after a monument of white marble wreathed about with laurel, erected over his grave at the charge of lord Hatton of Kirby. Perhaps the greate&s;t merit which this author has to plead, is his attachment to Ben John&s;on, and admiration of him: Silius Ita|licus performed an annual vi&s;it to Virgil's tomb, and that circum&s;tance reflects more honour upon him in the eyes of Virgil's admirers, than all the works of that author. Langbaine has pre&s;erved a monument of Randolph's friend&s;hip for Ben John|&s;on, in an ode he addre&s;&s;ed to him, occa&s;ioned by Mr. Feltham's &s;evere attack upon him, which is particularized in the life of Ben; from this ode we &s;hall quote a &s;tanza or two, before I give an ac|count of his dramatic compo&s;itions.<Q><LG>

<HEAD>GEORGE CHAPMAN</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in the year 1557, but of what family he is de&s;cended, Mr. Wood has not been able to determine; he was a man in very high reputation in his time, and added not a little to dramatic excellence. In 1574, being well ground|ed in grammar learning, he was &s;ent to the uni|ver&s;ity, but it is not clear whether to Oxford or Cambridge; it is certain that he was &s;ometime in Oxford, and was taken notice of for his great

&s;kill in the Latin and Greek languages, but not in logic and philo&s;ophy, which is the rea&s;on it may be pre&s;umed, that he took no degree there. After this he came to London, and contracted an ac|quaintance, as Wood &s;ays, with Shake&s;pear, John|&s;on, Sidney, Spen&s;er and Daniel. He met with a very warm patronage from Sir Thomas Wal&s;ing|ham, who had always had a con&s;tant friend&s;hip for him, and after that gentleman's decea&s;e, from his &s;on Thomas Wal&s;ingham, e&s;quire, whom Chap|man loved f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">om his birth.

<P>Chapman was a man of a reverend a&s;pect, and graceful manner, religious and temperate, qualities which &s;eldom meet (&s;ays Wood) in a poet, and was &s;o highly e&s;teemed by the clergy, that &s;ome of them have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that as Mu&s;aeus, who wrote the lives of Hero and Leander, had two excellent &s;cholars, Thamarus and Hercules, &s;o had he in England in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth, two ex|cellent imitators in the &s;ame argument and &s;ub|ject, viz.

He likewi&s;e tran&s;lated the Ody&s;&s;ey, and the Battle of Frogs and Mice, which were publi&s;hed in 1614, and dedicated to the earl of Somer&s;et; to this work is added Hymns and Epigrams, written by Homer, and tran&s;lated by our author.

<P>ONE of the be&s;t dramatic poets of the 17th century, was de&s;cended from a Scots family, his grandfather, who was a gentleman, being ori|ginally of Annandale in that kingdom, whence he removed to Carli&s;le, and afterwards was employed in the &s;ervice of King Henry VIII. His father lo&s;t his e&s;tate under Queen Mary, in who&s;e reign he &s;uffered impri&s;onment, and at la&s;t entered into holy orders, and died about a month before our poet's birth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Drummond of Hawthornden's works, fol. 224. Edin|bargh Edition, 1711.</NOTE>, who was born at We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;ays Wood, in the year 1574. He was fir&s;t educated at a private &s;chool in the church of St. Martin's in the Fields, afterwards removed to We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool, where the famous Camden was ma&s;ter. His mo|ther, who married a bricklayer to her &s;econd hu&s;|band, took him from &s;chool, and obliged him to work at his father-in-law's trade, but being ex|tremely aver&s;e to that employment, he went into the low countries, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his bravery, having in the view of the army killed an enemy, and taken the opima &s;polia from him.</P>
<P>Upon his return to England, he applied him&s;elf again to his former &s;tudies, and Wood &s;ays he was admitted into St. John's College in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, though his continuance there &s;eems to have been but &s;hort. He had &s;ome time after this the misfortune to fight a duel, and kill his ad|ver&s;ary, who only &s;lightly wounded him in the arm; for this he was impri&s;oned, and being ca&s;t for his life, was near execution; his antagoni&s;t, he
<PB N="236" REF="241">
&s;aid, had a &s;word ten inches longer than his own.</P>
<P>While he lay in pri&s;on, a popi&s;h prie&s;t vi&s;ited him, who found his inclination quite di&s;engaged as to reli|gion, and therefore took the opportunity to impre&s;s him with a belief of the popi&s;h tenets. His mind then naturally melancholy, clouded with apprehen|&s;ions, and the dread of execution, was the more ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon. However, &s;uch was the force of that impre&s;&s;ion, that for twelve years after he had gained his liberty, he continued in the catholic faith, and at la&s;t turned Prote&s;tant, whether from conviction or fa&s;hion cannot be determined; but when the character of Ben is con&s;idered, probabi|lity will be upon the &s;ide of the latter, for he took every occa&s;ion to ridicule religion in his plays, and make it his &s;port in conver&s;ation. On his leaving the univer&s;ity he entered him&s;elf into an ob&s;cure playhou&s;e, called the Green Cur|tain, &s;omewhere about Shoreditch or Clerkenwell. He was fir&s;t an actor, and probably only a &s;trolling one; for Decker in his Satyroma&s;tix, a play pub|li&s;hed in 1602, and de&s;igned as a reply to John|&s;on's Poeta&s;ter, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'reproaches him with having left the occupation of a mortar trader to turn actor, and with having put up a &s;upplication to be a poor journeyman player, in which he would have continued, but that he could not &s;et a good face upon it, and &s;o was ca&s;hiered. Be&s;ides, if we ad|mit that &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e to be built on facts, we learn fur|ther, that he performed the part of Zuliman at the Paris Garden in Southwark, and ambled by a play-waggon on the high-way, and took mad Jeronymo's part to get &s;ervice among&s;t the mi|micks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Birch's Lives of Illu&s;trious Men.</NOTE>.'</Q> Shake&s;pear is &s;aid to have fir&s;t intro|duced him to the world, by recommending a play of his to the &s;tage, at the time when one of the

players had rejected his performance, and told him it would be of no &s;ervice to their company<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Shake&s;pear.</NOTE>. His fir&s;t printed dramatic performance was a Comedy, entitled Every Man in his Humour, acted in the year 1598, which being &s;oon followed by &s;everal others, as his Sejanus, his Volpone, his Silent Wo|man, and his Alchymi&s;t, gained him &s;o high a re|putation, that in October 1619, upon the death of Mr. Samuel Daniel he was made Poet Laureat to King James I. and on the 19th of July, the &s;ame year, he was created (&s;ays Wood) Ma&s;ter of Arts at Oxford, having re&s;ided for &s;ome time at Chri&s;t Church in that univer&s;ity. He once incurred his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure for being concerned with Chapman and Mar&s;ton in writing a play called Ea&s;tward-Hoe, wherein they were accu&s;ed of having reflected upon the Scotch nation. Sir James Murray repre&s;ented it to the King, who or|dered them immediately to be impri&s;oned, and they were in great danger of lo&s;ing their ears and no&s;es, as a correction of their wantonne&s;s; nor could the mo&s;t partial have blamed his Maje&s;ty, if the puni&s;hment had been inflicted; for &s;urely to ri|dicule a country from which their Sovereign had ju&s;t come, the place of his nativity, and the king|dom of his illu&s;trious forefathers, was a mo&s;t daring in&s;ult. Upon their relea&s;ement from pri&s;on, our poet gave an entertainment to his friends, among whom were Camden and Selden; when his aged mother drank to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Drummond's works.</NOTE> and &s;hewed him a paper of poi|&s;on which &s;he had de&s;igned, if the &s;entence of pu|ni&s;hment had been inflicted, to have mixed with his drink after &s;he had fir&s;t taken a potion of it her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Charles I. to the crown, he wrote a petition to that Prince, craving, that as his
<PB N="238" REF="243">
royal father had allowed him an annual pen&s;ion of a hundred marks, he would make them pounds. In the year 1629 Ben fell &s;ick, and was then poor, and lodged in an ob&s;cure alley; his Maje&s;ty was &s;upplicated in his favour, who &s;ent him ten guineas. When the me&s;&s;enger delivered the &s;um, Ben took it in his hand, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His Maje&s;ty has &s;ent me ten guineas becau&s;e I am poor and live in an alley, go and tell him that his &s;oul lives in an alley."</Q></P>
<P>He had a pen&s;ion from the city of London, from &s;everal of the nobility and gentry, and particular|ly from Mr. Sutton the founder of the Charter|hou&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Wood.</NOTE>. In his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s he often repented of the profanation of &s;cripture in his plays. He died the 16th of Augu&s;t 1637, in the 63d year of his age, and was interred three days after in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; he had &s;everal children who &s;urvived him.</P>
<P>Ben John&s;on conceived &s;o high an opinion of Mr. Drummond of Hawthornden by the letters which pa&s;&s;ed between them, that he undertook a journey into Scotland, and re&s;ided &s;ome time at Mr. Drummond's &s;eat there, who has print|ed the heads of their conver&s;ation, and as it is a curious circum&s;tance to know the opinion of &s;o great a man as John&s;on of his cotemporary writers, the&s;e heads are here in&s;erted.</P>

<P>His cen&s;ure of the Engli&s;h poets was as follows: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"That Sidney did not keep a decorum, in making every one &s;peak as well as him&s;elf.

Samuel Daniel was a good hone&s;t man, had no children, and was no poet, and that he had wrote the civil wars without having one battle in all his book.

He affirm|ed, that Donne wrote all his be&s;t pieces before he was twenty years of age. He told Donne, that his Anniver&s;ary was prophane, and full of bla&s;phe|mies, that if it had been written on the virgin Mary it had been tolerable. To which Donne an&s;wered, that he de&s;cribed the idea of a woman but not as &s;he was. That Sir Walter Raleigh e|&s;teemed fame more than con&s;cience; the be&s;t wits in England were employed in making his hi&s;tory. Ben him&s;elf had written a piece to him on the Punic war, which he altered and put in his book. He &s;aid there was no &s;uch ground for an heroic poem, as King Arthur's fiction, and Sir Philip Sidney had an intention of turn|ing all his Arcadia to the &s;tories of King Ar|thur. He &s;aid Owen was a poor pedantic &s;chool|ma&s;ter, &s;ucking his living from the po&s;teriors of little children, and has nothing good in him, his epigrams being bare narrations.

<P>Mr. Drummond has repre&s;ented the character of our author in a very di&s;advantageous, though perhaps not in a very unju&s;t light. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was a great lover and prai&s;er of him&s;elf; a contemner and &s;corner of others, rather chu&s;ing to lo&s;e a friend than a je&s;t; jealous of every word and action of tho&s;e about him, e&s;pecially after drink, which was one of the elements in which he lived; a di&s;&s;embler of the parts which reigned in him; a

bragger of &s;ome good that he wanted: he thought nothing right, but what either him&s;elf or &s;ome of his friends had &s;aid or done.

He was for any religion, being ver&s;ed in all; his inventions were &s;mooth and ea&s;y, but above all he excelled in tran&s;lation. In &s;hort, he was in his per&s;onal cha|racter the very rever&s;e of Shake&s;pear; as &s;urly, ill|natured, proud and di&s;agreeable, as Shake&s;pear with ten times his merit was gentle, good-na|tured, ea&s;y and amiable."</Q> He had a very &s;trong memory; for he tells him&s;elf in his di&s;coveries, that he cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d in his youth have repeated all that he had ever written, and &s;o continued till he was pa&s;t &s;orty; and even after that he could have repeated whole books that he had read, and poems of &s;ome &s;e|lect friends, which he thought worth remembring.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope remarks, that when Ben got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, he brought critical learning into vogue, and that this was not done without difficulty, which appears &s;rom tho&s;e frequent le&s;&s;ons (and indeed almo&s;t declamations) which he was forced to prefix to his fir&s;t plays, and put into the mouths of his actors, the Grex, Chorus, &amp;c. to remove the prejudices and inform the judgement of his hearers. Till then the Engli&s;h authors had no thoughts of writing upon the model of the an|cients: their tragedies were only hi&s;tories in di|alogue, and their comedies followed the thread of any novel, as they found it, no le&s;s implicitly than if it had been true hi&s;tory. Mr. Selden in his preface to his titles of honour, &s;tiles John&s;on, his beloved friend and a &s;ingular poet, and ex|tols his &s;pecial worth in literature, and his ac|curate judgment. Mr. Dryden gives him the ti|tle of the greate&s;t man of the la&s;t age, and ob|&s;erves,
<PB N="242" REF="247">
that if we look upon him, when he was him&s;elf, (for his la&s;t plays were but his dotages) he was the mo&s;t learned and judicious writer any theatre ever had; that he was a mo&s;t &s;evere judge of him&s;elf as well as others; that we cannot &s;ay he wanted wit, but rather that he was frugal of it; that in his works there is little to be retrenched or al|tered; but that humour was his chief province.</P>
<P>Ben had certainly no great talent for ver&s;ification, nor does he &s;eem to have had an extraordinary ear; his ver&s;es are often wanting in &s;yllables, and &s;ometimes have too many.</P>
<P>I &s;hall quote &s;ome lines of his poem to the memory of Shake&s;pear, before I give a detail of his pieces.<Q><LG>

<HEAD>Sir HENRY WOTTON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great man was born in the year 1568, at Bocton Hall in the county of Kent, de|&s;cended of a very ancient family, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the wars between the Scotch and Engli&s;h before the union of crowns. The father of Sir Henry Wotton, (according to the account of the learned bi&s;hop Walton,) was twice married, and after the death of his &s;econd wife, &s;ays the bi&s;hop, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'his inclination, though naturally aver&s;e to all contentions, yet nece&s;&s;itated he was to have &s;everal &s;uits of law, which took up much of his time; he was by divers of his friends per&s;waded to remarriage, to whom he often an|&s;wered, that if he did put on a re&s;olution to marry. he &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olved to avoid three &s;orts of per&s;ons, namely, <Q><L>' Tho&s;e that had children,</L>
<L>' law &s;uits,</L>
<L>' were of his kindred:</L></Q> 'And yet following his own law &s;uit, he met in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall with one Mrs. Morton, the wi|dow of a gentleman of Kent, who was engaged in &s;everal &s;uits in law, and ob&s;erving her com|portment, the time of her hearing one of her cau&s;es before the judges, he could not but at the
<PB N="253" REF="258">
&s;ame time compa&s;&s;ionate her condition, and &s;o affect her per&s;on, that though there were in her a concurrence of all tho&s;e accidents, again&s;t which he had &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;olved, yet his af|fection grew &s;o &s;trong, that he then re&s;olved to &s;ollicit her for a wife, and did, and obtained her.'</Q></P>
<P>By this lady he had our author, who received the rudiments of his education from his mother, who was it &s;eems a woman of ta&s;te, and capable of in|&s;piring him with a love of polite accompli&s;hments. When he became fit for an academical education, he was placed in New College in Oxford, in the beginning of the year 1584, where living in the condition of a Gentleman Commoner, he con|tracted an intimacy with Sir Richard Baker, after|wards an eminent hi&s;torian. Sir Henry did not long continue there, but removed to Queen's Col|lege, where, &s;ays Walton, he made a great pro|gre&s;s in logic and philo&s;ophy, and wrote a Tra|gedy for the u&s;e of that college, called Tarroredo. Walton tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that this tragedy was &s;o inter|woven with &s;entences, and for the exact per&s;onat|ing tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and humours he propo&s;ed to repre&s;ent, he &s;o performed, that the grave&s;t of the &s;ociety declared, that he had in a &s;light employment, given an early and &s;olid te&s;timony of his future abilities.'</Q></P>
<P>On the 8th of June, &s;ays Wood, 1588, he as a member of Queen's College, &s;upplicated the vene|rable congregation of regents, that he might be admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, which de&s;ire was granted conditionally, that he &s;hould determine the Lent following, but whether he was admitted, or did determine, or took any degree, does not appear in any of the univer&s;ity regi&s;ters; though Mr. Walton &s;ays, that about the twentieth year of his age, he proceeded Ma&s;ter of Arts, and at that time read in Latin three lectures de Ocello.
<PB N="254" REF="259">
During the time he was at the univer&s;ity, and gaining much upon mankind by the reputation of his abilities, his father, for whom he had the highe&s;t veneration, died, and left him a hundred marks a year, to be paid out of one of his ma|nors of great value. Walton proceeds to relate a very a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tance concerning the father of our author, which as it is of the vi&s;ionary &s;ort, the reader may credit, or not, as he plea&s;es; it is however too curious to be here omitted, e&s;pecially as the learned prelate Walton already mentioned has told it with great earne&s;tne&s;s, as if he was per&s;uaded of its reality.</P>
<P>In the year 1553, Nicholas Wotton, dean of Canterbury, uncle to our author's father, being amba&s;&s;ador in France in the reign of queen Mary, dreamed, that his nephew Thomas Wot|ton, was di&s;po&s;ed to be a party in a very hazard|ous project, which if not &s;uddenly prevented, would i&s;&s;ue in the lo&s;s of his life, and the ruin of his family; the dean, who was per&s;uaded of the importance of his own dream, was very un|ea&s;y; but le&s;t he &s;hould be thought &s;uper&s;titious, he re&s;olved to conceal the circum&s;tance, and not to acquaint his nephew, or any body el&s;e with it; but dreaming the &s;ame a &s;econd time, he determined to put &s;omething in execution in con&s;equence of it; he accordingly wrote to the Queen to &s;end for his nephew Thomas Wotton out of Kent, and that the Lords of the Council might examine him about &s;ome imaginary con&s;piracy, &s;o as to give colour for his being committed to Jail, de|claring that he would acquaint her Maje&s;ty with the true rea&s;on of his reque&s;t, when he &s;hould next be &s;o happy to pay his duty to her. The Queen complied with the dean's de&s;ire, who at that time it &s;eems had great influence with that bigotted Prince&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260">
About this time a marriage was concluded be|tween the Queen of England, and Philip, King of Spain, which not a little di&s;obliged &s;ome of the nobility, who were jealous le&s;t their country by &s;uch a match &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the do|minion of Spain, and their independent rights in|vaded by that imperious monarch. The&s;e &s;u&s;pici|ons produced an in&s;urrection, which was headed by the duke of Suffolk and Sir Thomas Wyat, who both lo&s;t their lives in the attempt to pre|vent the match by &s;eizing the Queen; for the de&s;ign was &s;oon di&s;covered, ea&s;ily defeated, and tho&s;e two per&s;ons, with many more, &s;uffered on a &s;caffold.</P>
<P>Between Sir Thomas Wyat and the Wotton's fa|mily, there had been a long intimacy, and Sir Thomas had really won Mr. Wotton over to his intere&s;t, and had he not been prevented by im|pri&s;onment, he afterwards declared that he would have joined his friend in the in&s;urrection, and in all probability would have fallen a &s;acrifice to the Queen's re&s;entment, and the votaries of the Spani&s;h match.</P>
<P>After Sir Henry quitted the univer&s;ity of Oxford, he travelled into France, Germany and Italy, where he re&s;ided above nine years, and returned to his own country perfectly accompli&s;hed in all the polite improvements, which men of &s;en&s;e acquire by travelling, and well acquainted with the tem|per and genius of the people with whom he had conver&s;ed, and the different policy of their go|vernments. He was &s;oon taken notice of after his return, and became &s;ecretary to the famous Ro|bert Devereux, earl of E&s;&s;ex, that unfortunate favourite, who&s;e &s;tory is never exhibited on the &s;tage, &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, without affecting the heart in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner. With his lord&s;hip he continued in the character of
<PB N="256" REF="261">
&s;ecretary 'till the earl was apprehended for his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|tinous behaviour towards the Queen, and put up|on his trial. Wotton, who did not think it &s;afe to continue in England after the fall of his ma&s;ter, retired to Florence, became acquainted with the Great Duke of Tu&s;cany, and ro&s;e &s;o high in his favour, that he was entru&s;ted by him to carry letters to James VI. King of Scots, under the name of Octavio Baldi, in order to inform that king of a de&s;ign again&s;t his life. Walton informs us, that though Queen Elizabeth was never willing to declare her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, yet the King of Scots was generally believed to be the per&s;on, on whom the crown of England would devolve. The Queen declining very fa&s;t, both through age and vi&s;ible infirmities, <Q REND="inline">"tho&s;e that were of the Romi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion, in point of religion, knowing that the death of the Queen, and e&s;tabli&s;hing her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was the cri&s;is for de&s;troying or &s;upporting the Prote&s;tant religion in this nation, did therefore improve all opportunities for preventing a Pro|te&s;tant Prince to &s;ucceed her; and as the pope's excommunication of Queen Elizabeth had both by the judgment and practice of the je&s;uited Papi&s;ts, expo&s;ed her to be warrantably de&s;troyed, &s;o about that time, there were many endeavours fir&s;t to ex|communicate, and then to &s;horten the life of King James VI."</Q></P>
<P>Immediately after Wotton's return from Rome to Florence, which was about a year before the death of Queen Elizabeth; Ferdinand, the Great Duke, had intercepted certain letters, which di&s;|covered a de&s;ign again&s;t the life of the King of Scots. The Duke abhorring the &s;cheme of a&s;|fa&s;&s;ination, and re&s;olving to prevent it, advi&s;ed with his &s;ecretary Vietta, by what means a caution &s;hould be given to the Scotch Prince. Vietta re|commended Wotton as a per&s;on of the highe&s;t a|bilities
<PB N="257" REF="262">
of any Engli&s;hman then at his court: Mr. Wotton was &s;ent for by his friend Vietta to the Duke, who after many profe&s;&s;ions of tru&s;t and friend&s;hip, acquainted him with the &s;ecret, and &s;ent him to Scotland with letters to the King, and &s;uch antidotes again&s;t poi&s;on, as till then, the Scots had been &s;trangers to. Mr. Wotton having departed from the Duke, a&s;&s;umed the name and language of an Italian, which he &s;poke &s;o fluent|ly, and with &s;o little mixture of a foreign dialect, that he could &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a na|tive of Italy; and thinking it be&s;t to avoid the line of Engli&s;h intelligence and danger, po&s;ted into Norway, and through that country towards Scotland, where he found the King at Stirling.</P>
<P>When he arrived there, he u&s;ed means by one of the gentlemen of his Maje&s;ty's bed-chamber, to procure a &s;peedy and private audience of his Maje&s;ty, declaring that the bu&s;ine&s;s which he was to negotiate was of &s;uch con&s;equence, as had ex|cited the Great Duke of Tu&s;cany to enjoin him &s;uddenly to leave his native country of Italy, to impart it to the king.</P>
<P>The King being informed of this, after a little wonder, mixed with jealou&s;y, to hear of an Italian amba&s;&s;ador or me&s;&s;enger, appointed a private au|dience that evening. When Mr. Wotton came to the pre&s;ence chamber, he was de&s;ired to lay a&s;ide his long rapier, and being entered, found the King there, with three or four Scotch lords &s;tand|ing di&s;tant in &s;everal corners of the chamber; at the &s;ight of whom he made a &s;tand, and which the King ob&s;erving, bid him be bold, and deliver his me&s;&s;age, and he would undertake for the &s;ecre&s;y of all who were pre&s;ent. Upon this he delivered his me&s;&s;age and letters to his Maje&s;ty in Italian; which when the King had graciou&s;ly received, af|ter a little pau&s;e, Mr. Wotton &s;tept up to the ta|ble,
<PB N="258" REF="263">
and whi&s;pered to the King in his own lan|guage that he was an Engli&s;hman, reque&s;ting a more private conference with his Maje&s;ty, and that he might be concealed during his &s;tay in that na|tion, which was promi&s;ed, and really performed by the King, all the time he remained at the Scotch court; he then returned to the Duke with a &s;atis|factory account of his employment.</P>
<P>When King James &s;ucceeded to the Throne of England, he found among others of Queen Eli|zabeth's officers, Sir Edward Wotton, afterwards lord Wotton, Comptroller of the Hou&s;hold, whom he asked one day, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'whether he knew one Henry Wotton, who had &s;pent much time in foreign travel?'</Q> Sir Edward replied, that he knew him well, and that he was his brother. The King then asked, where he was, and upon Sir Ed|ward's an&s;wering that he believed he would &s;oon be at Paris, &s;end for him &s;ays his Maje&s;ty, and when he comes to England, bid him repair pri|vately to me. Sir Edward, after a little wonder, asked his Maje&s;ty, whether he knew him? to which the King an&s;wered, you mu&s;t re&s;t un&s;atisfied of that 'till you bring the gentleman to me. Not many months after this di&s;cour&s;e, Sir Edward brought his brother to attend the king, who took him in his arms, and bid him welcome under the name of Octavio Baldi, &s;aying, that he was the mo&s;t hone&s;t, and therefore the be&s;t, di&s;&s;embler he ever met with; and &s;eeing I know, added the King, you want neither learning, travel, nor ex|perience, and that I have had &s;o real a te&s;timony of your faithfulne&s;s and abilities to manage an emba&s;&s;age, I have &s;ent for you to declare my purpo&s;es, which is to make u&s;e of you in that kind hereafter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Walton, ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. But before he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Octa|vio
<PB N="259" REF="264">
Baldi from his pre&s;ent attendance, he re&s;tored him to his old name of Henry Wotton, by which he then knighted him.</P>
<P>Not long after this, King James having re&s;olved according to his motto of beati pacifici, to have a friend&s;hip with his neighbouring kingdoms of France and Spain, and al&s;o to enter into an al|liance with the State of Venice, and for that pur|po&s;e to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to tho&s;e &s;everal States, offered to Sir Henry his choice of which ever of the&s;e employments be&s;t &s;uited his inclination; who from the con&s;ideration of his own per&s;onal e&s;tate being &s;mall, and the courts of France and Spain extreamly &s;umptuous, &s;o as to expo&s;e him to ex|pences above his fortune, made choice of Venice, a place of more retirement, and where he could execute his emba&s;&s;y, and at the &s;ame time indulge him&s;elf in the &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy, in that &s;eat of the &s;ciences, where he was &s;ure to meet with men accompli&s;hed in all the polite improve|ments, as well as the more &s;olid attainments of philo&s;ophy. Having informed the king that he cho&s;e to be &s;ent to Venice, his Maje&s;ty &s;ettled a very con&s;iderable allowance upon him during his &s;tay there; he then took his leave, and was ac|companied through France to Venice, &s;ays Wal|ton, by gentlemen of the be&s;t families and breed|ing, that this nation afforded.</P>
<P>When Sir Henry Wotton arrived at Venice, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Venetians and the Pope a very warm contention, which was pro&s;ecuted by both parties with equal fury. The laity made many complaints again&s;t the two frequent prac|tice of land being left to the church without a licence from the &s;tate, which increa&s;ed the power of the clergy, already too great, and rendered their in&s;olence in&s;upportable. In con&s;equence of this, the &s;tate made &s;everal injunctions again&s;t lay-per&s;ons
<PB N="260" REF="265">
di&s;po&s;ing their lands in that manner. Another cau&s;e of their quarrel was, that the Venetians had &s;ent to Rome, &s;everal articles of complaint again&s;t two prie&s;ts, the abbot of Nerve&s;a, and a canon of Vicenza, for committing &s;uch abominable crimes; as Mr. Walton &s;ays, it would be a &s;hame to mention: Their complaints met with no redre&s;s, and the dete&s;table practices of the&s;e mon&s;ters in holy orders &s;till continuing, they &s;eized their per|&s;ons and committed them to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of &s;uch power exerci&s;ed by the Venetians, produced debates between the Repub|lic and Pope Clement VIII. Clement &s;oon dying, Pope Paul the fir&s;t, a man of unbounded in&s;olence, and elated with his &s;piritual &s;uperiority, let loo&s;e all his rage again&s;t the &s;tate. He judged all re&s;i&s;tance to be a diminution of his power, and threatened excom|munication to the whole State, if a revocation was not in&s;tantly made, which the Venetians rejecting, he proceeded in menaces, and at la&s;t did excom|municate the Duke, the whole Senate, and all their dominions; then he &s;hut up the churches, charg|ing the clergy to forbear &s;acred offices to any of the Venetians, till their obedience &s;hould make them capable of ab&s;olution. The contention was thus fomented, till a report prevailed that the Vene|tians were turned Prote&s;tants, which was believed by many, as the Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ador was &s;o often in conference with the Senate, and that they had made all their proceedings known to the King of England, who would &s;upport them, &s;hould the Pope pre&s;ume to exerci&s;e any more oppre&s;&s;ions. This circum&s;tance made it appear plain enough to his Holine&s;s, that he weakened his power by ex|ceeding it; and being alarmed le&s;t a revolution &s;hould happen, offered the Venetians ab&s;olution upon very ea&s;y terms, which the Republic &s;till &s;lighting, did at la&s;t obtain it, by that which was &s;carce &s;o much as a &s;hew of de&s;iring it.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="266">
For eight years after Sir Henry Wotton's going into Italy, he &s;tood very high in the King's e&s;teem, but at la&s;t, lo&s;t his favour for &s;ome time, by an ac+cident too &s;ingular to be here omitted.</P>
<P>When he fir&s;t went emba&s;&s;ador to Italy, as he pa&s;&s;ed through Germany he &s;taid &s;ome days at Augs|burgh, where having been in his former travels well known by many of the fir&s;t reputation in learning, and pa&s;&s;ing an evening in merriment, he was de&s;ired by Chri&s;topher Hecamore to write a &s;entence in his Album, and con&s;enting to it, took occa&s;ion from &s;ome accidental conver&s;ation which happened in the company, to write a plea&s;ant definition of an emba&s;&s;ador in the&s;e words. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Legatus e&s;t vir bo|nus, peregre-mi&s;&s;us ad mentiendum Republicae cau&s;a;"</Q> which he cho&s;e &s;hould have been thus rendered into Engli&s;h: An Amba&s;&s;ador is an hon|e&s;t Man, &s;ent to lie abroad for the good of his Country; but the word lie, upon which the conceit turned, was not &s;o expre&s;&s;ed in Latin, as to ad|mit a double meaning, or &s;o fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r a con&s;truction as Sir Henry thought, in Engli&s;h. About eight years after, this Album fell into the hands of Ga&s;par Scioppius, a re&s;tle&s;s zealot, who publi&s;hed books again&s;t King James, and upbraided him for entertaining &s;uch &s;candalous principles, as his emba&s;&s;ador had expre&s;&s;ed by that &s;entence: This a&s;per&s;ion gained ground, and it became fa&s;hiona|ble in Venice to write this definition in &s;everal gla&s;s windows. The&s;e incidents reaching the ear of King James, he was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the behaviour of his emba&s;&s;ador on that occa&s;ion, and from an innocent piece of wittici&s;m Sir Henry was like to pay very dear, by lo&s;ing his ma&s;ter's favour. Upon this our author wrote two apolo|gies, one to Vel&s;erus, which was di&s;per&s;ed in Ger|many and Italy, and another to the King; both which were &s;o well written, that his Maje&s;ty up|on
<PB N="262" REF="267">
reading them declared, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Sir Henry Wot|ton had &s;ufficiently commutted for a greater offence."</Q></P>
<P>Upon this reconciliation, Sir Henry became more in favour with his Maje&s;ty than ever; like friends who have been for &s;ome time &s;eparated, they meet again with double fervour, and their friend&s;hip in|crea&s;es to a greater warmth. During the twenty years which Sir Henry was amba&s;&s;ador at Venice, he had the good fortune to be &s;o well re&s;pected by all the Dukes, and the leading men of the Republic, that his intere&s;t every year increa&s;ed, and they &s;el|dom denied him any favour he a&s;ked for his country|men who came to Venice; which was, as Walton expre&s;&s;es it, a city of refuge &s;or all Engli&s;hmen who were any way di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in that Republic. Walton proceeds to relate two particular in&s;tances of the genero&s;ity, and tenderne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and the noblene&s;s of his mind, which, as they &s;erve to il|lu&s;trate his character, de&s;erve a place here.</P>
<P>There had been many Engli&s;hmen brought by commanders of their own country, to &s;erve the Ve|netians &s;or pay, again&s;t the Turks; and tho&s;e Eng|li&s;h, by irregularities, and imprudence, committed &s;uch offences as brought them into pri&s;ons, and ex|po&s;ed them to work in gallies. Wotton could not be an unconcerned &s;pectator of the mi&s;eries of his countrymen: their offences he knew proceeded ra|ther from wantonne&s;s, and intemperance, than any real principles of di&s;honour; and therefore he thought it not beneath him to become a petitioner for their relea&s;ement. He was happy in a &s;ucce&s;s|ful repre&s;entation of their calamities, they were &s;et at liberty, and had an opportunity of returning to their own country in comfort, in place of langui&s;h|ing in jails, and being &s;laves at the Gallies; and by this compa&s;&s;ionate Interpo&s;ition with the Republick, he had the ble&s;&s;ings of many mi&s;erable wretches: the
<PB N="263" REF="268">
highe&s;t plea&s;ure which any human being can enjoy on this &s;ide immortality.</P>
<P>Of the genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of his mind, Walton gives this in&s;tance;</P>
<P>Upon Sir Henry Wotton's coming a &s;econd time to Venice, he was employed as emba&s;&s;ador to &s;eve|ral of the German princes, and to the Emperor Ferdinando II. and this emba&s;&s;y to the&s;e prin|ces was to incline them to equitable mea&s;ures, for the re&s;toration of the Queen of Bohemia, and her de&s;cendants, to their patrimonial inheritance of the Palatinate. This was by eight months con&s;tant en|deavours and attendance upon the Emperor and his court, brought to a probability of a &s;ucce&s;sful con|clu&s;ion, by a treaty; but about that time the Em|peror's army fought a battle &s;o fortunately, as put an end to the expected treaty, and Sir Henry Wot|ton's hopes, who when he quitted the Emperor's court, humbly advi&s;ed him, to u&s;e his victory with moderation, which advice the Emperor was plea&s;ed to hear graciou&s;ly, being well &s;atisfied with Wot|ton's behaviour during his re&s;idence at his court. He then told him, that tho' the King his ma&s;ter was looked upon as an abetter of his enemy, yet he could not help demon&s;trating his regard to him, by making him a pre&s;ent of a rich jewel of diamonds, worth more than ten thou&s;and pounds. This was received with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect by Sir Henry; but the next morning upon his departing from Vienna, at his taking leave of the Counte&s;s of Sabrina, an Italian lady, in who&s;e hou&s;e he re|&s;ided, he expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude for her civilities by pre&s;enting her with the jewel given him by the Emperor, which being afterwards di&s;covered, was by the Emperor taken as an affront; but Sir Hen|ry acknowledging his gratitude for the mark of di&s;tinction &s;hewn to him, at the &s;ame time decla|red, he did not chu&s;e to receive profit from any
<PB N="264" REF="269">
pre&s;ent, given him by an enemy of his royal mi&s;|tre&s;s, for &s;o the Queen of Bohemia, the elde&s;t daugh|ter of the King of England, permitted him to call her.</P>
<P>Upon Sir Henry Wotton's return from his emba&s;|&s;y, he &s;ignified an inclination to the King to be ex|cu&s;ed from any further employment in foreign af|fairs, to retire from the bu&s;tle of life, and &s;pend the evening of his days in &s;tudious ea&s;e and tran|quility. His Maje&s;ty in con&s;equence of this reque&s;t, promi&s;ed him the rever&s;ion of an office, which was the place of Ma&s;ter of the Rolles, if he out-lived Sir Julius Cae&s;ar, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and was grown &s;o old, that he was &s;aid to be kept alive beyond nature's cour&s;e, by the prayers of the many people who daily lived upon his bounty. Here it will not be improper to ob&s;erve, that Sir Henry Wot|ton had, thro' a genero&s;ity of temper, reduced his affairs to &s;uch a &s;tate, that he could not live without &s;ome profitable employment, as he was indebted to many per&s;ons for money he borrowed to &s;upport his dignity in his emba&s;&s;y, the King's appointment for that purpo&s;e being either not re|gularly paid, or too incon&s;iderable for the ex|pence. This rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him to wait the death of Sir Julius Cae&s;ar; be&s;ides that place had been long &s;ollicited by that worthy gen|tleman for his &s;on, and it would have been thought an ill-natured office, to have by any means pre|vented it.</P>
<P>It luckily happened at this time, that the Pro|vo&s;t&s;hip of his Maje&s;ty's college at Eaton became vacant by the death of Mr. Murray, for which there were many earne&s;t and powerful &s;ollicitati|ons. This place was admirably &s;uited to the cour&s;e of life Wotton re&s;olved to pur&s;ue, for the remaining part of his days; he had &s;een enough of the world to be &s;ick of it, and being now three|&s;core
<PB N="265" REF="270">
years of age, he thought a college was the fitte&s;t place to indulge contemplation, and to re&s;t his body and mind after a long &s;truggle on the theatre of life. In his &s;uit for this place he was hap|pily &s;ucce&s;sful, and immediately entered into holy orders, which was nece&s;&s;ary, before he could take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new office. Walton has related the particular manner of his &s;pending his time, which was divided between attendance upon public de|votion, the more private duties of religion, and the care which his function demanded from him of the affairs of the college. In the year 1639 Sir Hen|ry died in Eaton-College, and was buried in the chapel belonging to it. He directed the follow|ing &s;entence to be put upon a marble monument to be erected over him.<Q><P>Hic jacit hujus &s;ententiae primus author. Di&s;pu|tandi pruritus eccle&s;iarum &s;cabies.

Langbaine calls his plays &s;econd rate performances, but the wits of his time would not permit them to rank &s;o high. He was according to his own confe&s;&s;ion, one of the mo&s;t voluminous writers, that ever attempted dramatic poetry in any language, and none but the celebrated Spaniard Lopez de Vega can vie with him.

In the year 1610 he began a long journey, and after he had travelled through &s;everal parts of Europe, he vi&s;ited many cities, e&s;pecially Con&s;tantinople, and countries un|der the Turki&s;h empire, as Greece, Egypt, and the Holy Land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Athen. Oxon. p. 46. vol. ii.</NOTE>. Afterwards he took a view of the remote parts of Italy, and the I&s;lands adjoining: Then he went to Rome; the antiquities of that place were &s;hewn him by Nicholas Fitzherbert, once an Oxford &s;tudent, and who had the honour of Mr. Sandys's acquaintance. Thence our author went to Venice, and from that returned to Eng|land, where dige&s;ting his notes, he publi&s;hed his travels. Sandys, who appears to have been a man of excellent parts, of a pious and generous di&s;po|&s;ition. did not, like too many travellers, turn his attention upon the modes of dre&s;s, and the fa&s;hions of the &s;everal courts which is but a poor acqui&s;i|tion; but he &s;tudied the genius, the tempers, the religion, and the governing principles of the peo|ple he vi&s;ited, as much as his time among&s;t them would permit. He returned in 1612, being im|proved, &s;ays Wood, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'in &s;everal re&s;pects, by this his

He al&s;o wrote a Paraphra&s;e on the P&s;alms of David, and upon the Hymns di&s;per&s;ed throughout the Old and New Te&s;tament, London, 1636, reprinted there in folio 1638, with other things under this title.</P>

prejudice again&s;t Laud was, the extraordinary pa&s;|&s;ion and impatience of contradiction di&s;coverable in that proud prelate; who could not command his temper, even at the Council Table when his Ma|je&s;ty was pre&s;ent, but &s;eemed to lord it over all the re&s;t, not by the force of argument, but an a&s;&s;umed &s;uperiority to which he had no right. This nettled lord Falkland, and made him exert his &s;pirit to humble and oppo&s;e the &s;upercilious churchman.

As to the fir&s;t he condemned them as void of all ho|nour, and who ought ju&s;tly to be abandoned to in|famy, and that no &s;ingle pre&s;ervation could be worth &s;o general a wound and corruption of &s;oci|ty, as encouraging &s;uch people would carry with it.

<P>June 15, 1642, he was one of the lords who &s;igned the declaration, wherein they profe&s;&s;ed they were fully &s;atisfied his Maje&s;ty had no intention to rai&s;e war upon his Parliament. At the &s;ame time he &s;ub&s;cribed to levy twenty hor&s;e for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, upon which he was excepted from the Parliament's favour, in the in&s;tructions given by the two Hou&s;es to their general the Earl of E&s;&s;ex. He attended the King to Edge-hill fight, where after the enemy was routed he was expo&s;ed to imminent danger, by endeavour|ing to &s;ave tho&s;e who had thrown away their arms. He was al&s;o with his Maje&s;ty at Oxford, and during his re&s;idence there, the King went one day to &s;ee the public library, where he was &s;hewed, among other books, a Virgil nobly prin|ted, and exqui&s;itely bound. The Lord Falkland, to divert the King, would have him make a trial of his fortune by the Sortes Virgilianae, an u&s;ual kind of divination in ages pa&s;t, made by open|ing a Virgil. Whereupon the King opening the book, the period which happened to come up, was that part of Dido's imprecation again&s;t Aeneas, Aeneid. lib. 4. v. 615, part of which is thus tran&s;lated by Mr. Dryden,<Q><L>Oppre&s;s'd with numbers in th' unequal field,</L>

<P>Upon the beginning of the civil war, his na|tural chearfulne&s;s and vivacity was clouded, and a kind of &s;adne&s;s and dejection of &s;pirit &s;tole up|on him. After the re&s;olution of the two hou&s;es not to admit any treaty of peace, tho&s;e indi&s;po|&s;itions which had before touched him, grew into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">abit of gloomine&s;s; and he who had been ea|&s;y and affable to all men, became on a &s;udden le&s;s communicable, &s;ad, and extremely affected with the &s;pleen. In his dre&s;s, to which he had formerly paid an attention, beyond what might have been expected from a man of &s;o great ablities, and &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s, he became negligent and &s;lo|venly,

and in his reception of &s;uitors, &s;o quick, &s;harp, and &s;evere, that he was looked upon as proud and imperious.</P>
<P>When there was any hope of peace, his former &s;pirit u&s;ed to return and he appeared gay, and vigorous, and exceeding &s;ollicitous to pre&s;s any thing that might promote it; and Clarendon ob|&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That after a deep &s;ilence, when he was &s;itting among&s;t his friends, he would with a &s;hrill voice, and &s;ad accent, repeat the words Peace!

<P>This extream unea&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to have hurried him on to his de&s;truction; for the morning before the battle of Newbery, he called for a clean &s;hirt, and being a&s;ked the rea&s;on of it, an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if he were &s;lain in the battle, they &s;hould not find his body in foul linen."</Q> Being per|&s;uaded by his friends not to go into the fight, as being no military officer, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He &s;aid he was weary of the times, fore&s;aw much mi&s;ery to his country, and did believe he &s;hould be out of it e're night."</Q> Putting him&s;elf therefore in|to the fir&s;t rank of the Lord Byron's regiment, he was &s;hot with a mu&s;ket in the lower part of his belly, on the 20th of September 1643, and in the in&s;tant falling from his hor&s;e, his body was not found till next morning.</P>
<P>Thus died in the bed of honour, the incom|parable Lord Falkland, on whom all his con|temporaries be&s;towed the mo&s;t lavi&s;h encomiums, and very de&s;ervedly rai&s;ed altars of prai&s;e to his memory. Among all his panegyri&s;t, Clarendon is the foremo&s;t, and of highe&s;t authority; and in his words therefore, I &s;hall give his character to the reader. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In this unhappy battle, (&s;ays he)

<HEAD>Sir JOHN SUCKLING</HEAD>
<P>LIVED in the reign of King Charles I. and was &s;on of Sir John Suckling, comptroller of the hou&s;hold to that monarch. He was born at Witham, in the county of Middle&s;ex, 1613, with a remarkable circum&s;tance of his mother's going eleven months with him, which naturali&s;ts look upon as portending a hardy and vigorous con&s;ti|tution. A &s;trange circum&s;tance is related of him, in his early years, in a life prefixed to his works. He &s;poke Latin, &s;ays the author, at five years old, and wrote it at nine; if either of the&s;e circum|&s;tances is true, it would &s;eem as if he had learn|ed
<PB N="295" REF="300">
Latin from his nur&s;e, nor ever heard any o|ther language, &s;o that it was native to him; but to &s;peak Latin at five, in con&s;equence of &s;tudy, is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The polite arts, which our author chiefly ad|mired, were mu&s;ic and poetry; how far he ex|celled in the former, cannot be known, nor can we agree with his life-writer already mentioned, that he excelled in both. Sir John Suckling &s;eems to have been no poet, nor to have had even the mo&s;t di&s;tant appearances of it; his lines are generally &s;o unmu&s;ical, that none can read them without grating their ears; being author of &s;everal plays, he may indeed be called a dramati&s;t, and con&s;equently comes within our de&s;ign: but as he is de&s;titute of poetical conceptions, as well as the power of num|bers, he has no preten&s;ions to rank among the good poets.</P>
<P>Dryden &s;omewhere calls him a &s;prightly wit, a courtly writer. In this &s;en&s;e he is what Mr. Dry|den &s;tiles him; but then he is no poet, notwith|&s;tanding. His letters, which are publi&s;hed along with his plays, are exceeding courtly, his &s;tile ea|&s;y and genteel, and his thoughts natural; and in reading his letters, one would wonder that the &s;ame man, who could write &s;o elegantly in pro&s;e, &s;hould not better &s;ucceed in ver&s;e.</P>
<P>After Suckling had made him&s;elf acquainted with the con&s;titution of his own country, and ta|ken a &s;urvey of the mo&s;t remarkable things at home, he travelled to dige&s;t and enlarge his no|tions, from a view of other countries, where, &s;ays the above-mentioned author, he made a collecti|on of their virtues, without any tincture of their vices and follies, only that &s;ome were of opinion he copied the French air too much, which being di&s;agreeable to his father, who was remarkable for his gravity, and, indeed, incon&s;i&s;tent with the gloomine&s;s of the times, he was reproached for
<PB N="296" REF="301">
it, and it was imputed to him as the effects of his travels; but &s;ome were of opinion, that it was more natural than acquired, the ea&s;ine&s;s of his manner and addre&s;s being &s;uitable to the o|penne&s;s of his heart, the gaiety, wit and gal|lantry, which were &s;o con&s;picuous in him; and he &s;eems to have valued him&s;elf upon nothing more than the character of the Courtier and the Fine Gentleman, which he &s;o far attained, that he is allowed to have had the peculiar happine&s;s, of making every thing he did become him. While Suckling was thus a&s;&s;iduous about acquiring the reputation of a fini&s;hed courtier, and a man of fa&s;hion, it is no wonder that he neglected the higher excellencies of genius, for a poet and a beau, never yet were united in one per&s;on.</P>
<P>Sir John was not however, &s;o much devoted to the luxury of the court, as to be wholly a &s;tranger to the field. In his travels he made a campaign under the great Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, where he was pre&s;ent at three battles and five &s;ieges, be&s;ides other &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">irmi&s;hes between Parties; and from &s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;cene of action, gained as much experience in &s;ix months, as otherwi&s;e he would have done in as many years.</P>
<P>After his return to England, the Civil War being then raging, he rai&s;ed a troop of hor&s;e for the King's &s;ervice, entirely at his own charge, &s;o richly and compleatly mounted, that it &s;tood him in 1200 l. but his zeal for his Maje&s;ty did not meet with the &s;ucce&s;s it de&s;erved, which very much affected him; and &s;oon after this he was &s;eized with a fever, and died in the 28th year of his age. In which &s;hort &s;pace he had done enough to procure him the e&s;teem of the polite&s;t men who conver&s;ed with him; but as he had &s;et out in the world with all the advantages o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">, per&s;on, education, and fortune, peoples expectations of him were rai&s;ed to too great a
<PB N="297" REF="302">
heighth, which &s;eldom fails to i&s;&s;ue in a di&s;ap|pointment. He makes no figure in the hi&s;tory of the&s;e times, perhaps from the immaturity of his death, which prevented him from action. This might be one rea&s;on for his being neglected in the annals of the civil war: another might be, his unnece&s;&s;ary, or rather ridiculous &s;hew of fine|ry, which he affected in decorating his troop of hor&s;e. This could not fail to draw down con|tempt upon him, for in time of public di&s;tre&s;s, nothing can be more fooli&s;h than to wear the livery of pro&s;perity; and &s;urely an army would have no great rea&s;on to put much confidence in the conduct or courage of that general, who in the morning of a Battle &s;hould be found in his tent per&s;uming his hair, or arraying him&s;elf in embroidery.</P>
<P>Mr. Lloyd, in his memoirs of our author, ob|&s;erves, that his thoughts were not &s;o loo&s;e as his expre&s;&s;ions, nor his life &s;o vain as his thoughts; and at the &s;ame time makes an allowance for his youth and &s;anguine complexion; which, &s;ays he, a little more time and experience would have corrected. Of this, we have in&s;tances in his oc|ca&s;ional di&s;cour&s;es about religion to my Lord Dor|&s;et, to whom he was related; and in his thoughts of the po&s;ture of affairs; in both which he has di&s;covered that he could think as coolly, and rea|&s;on as ju&s;tly as men of more years, and le&s;s fire.</P>

<P>The above are as &s;mooth lines as could be found among our author's works; but in ju&s;tice to Suckling, before we give an account of his plays, we &s;hall tran&s;cribe one of his letters, when we are per&s;uaded the reader will join in the opi|nion already given of his works in general; it is addre&s;&s;ed to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and has &s;omething in it gay and &s;prightly.</P>

<HEAD>WILLIAM DRUMMOND of HAWTHORNDEN <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was a native of Scotland, and a poet of no incon&s;iderable rank. We had at fir&s;t &s;ome doubt whether he fell within our de&s;ign, as being no Engli&s;hman, but upon ob|&s;erving that Mr. Langbaine has given a place to the earl of Stirling, a man of much inferior note; and that our author, though a Scotchman, wrote extremely pure and elegant Engli&s;h, and his life, that is fruitful of a great many incidents, without further apology, it is here pre&s;ented to the reader.</P>
<P>He was born the 13th of November, 1585; his fa|ther was Sir John Drummond of Hawthornden, who was Gentleman U&s;her to King James VI. but did not enjoy that place long, being in three months after he was rai&s;ed to his new dignity, taken away by death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that I have taken the mo&s;t material part, of this account of Mr. Drummond, from a life of him prefixed to a 4to Edition printed at Edinburgh, 1711.</NOTE>. The family of Drummond in the ar|cle of antiquity is inferior to none in Scotland, where that kind of di&s;tinction is very much re|garded.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t years of our author's youth were &s;pent at the high &s;chool at Edinburgh, where the early promi&s;es of that extraordinary genius, which af|terwards appeared in him, became very con&s;pi|cuous. He was in due time &s;ent to the univer&s;i|ty of Edinburgh, where after the ordinary &s;tay, he was made Ma&s;ter of Arts. When his cour&s;e at the univer&s;ity was fini&s;hed, he did not, like the greate&s;t part of giddy &s;tudents, give over reading, and vainly imagine they have a &s;ufficient &s;tock
<PB N="303" REF="308">
of learning: he had too much &s;en&s;e thus to deceive him&s;elf; he knew that an education at the univer|&s;ity is but the ground-work of knowledge, and that unle&s;s a man dige&s;ts what he has there learned, and endeavours to produce it into life with advan|tage, &s;o many years attendance were but entirely thrown away. Being convinced of this truth, he continued to read the be&s;t authors of antiquity, whom he not only retained in his memory, but &s;o dige&s;ted, that he became quite ma&s;ter of them, and able to make &s;uch ob&s;ervations on their genius and writings, as fully &s;hewed that his judgment had been &s;ufficiently exerci&s;ed in reading them.</P>
<P>In the year 1606 his father &s;ent him into France, he being then only twenty-one years old. He &s;tu|died at Bourges the civil law, with great dili|gence and applau&s;e, and was ma&s;ter not only of the dictates of the profe&s;&s;ors, but made al&s;o his own ob|&s;ervations on them, which occa&s;ioned the learned pre|&s;ident Lockhart to ob&s;erve, that if Mr. Drummond had followed the practice, he might have made the be&s;t figure of any lawyer in his time; but like all o|ther men of wit, he &s;aw more charms in Euri|pides, Sophocles, Seneca, and other the illu&s;trious ancients, than in the dry wranglings of the law; as there have been often in&s;tances of poets, and men of genius being educated to the law, &s;o here it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that we remem|ber not to have met with one among&s;t them who continued in that profe&s;&s;ion, a circum&s;tance not much in its favour, and is a kind of proof, that the profe&s;&s;ors of it are generally compo&s;ed of men who are capable of application, but without genius. Mr. Drummond having, as we have al|ready ob&s;erved, a &s;overeign contempt for the law, applied him&s;elf to the &s;ublimer &s;tudies of poetry and hi&s;tory, in both which he became very emi|nent.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="309">
Having relinqui&s;hed all thoughts of the bar, or appearing in public, he retired to his plea&s;ant &s;eat at Hawthor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">den, and there, by reading the Greek and Latin authors, enriched the world with the product of his &s;olitary hours. After he had reco|vered a very dangerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s, he wrote his Cypre&s;s Grove, a piece of excellent pro&s;e, both for the finene&s;s of the &s;tile, and the &s;ublimity and piety of the &s;entiments: In which he repre&s;ents the vanity and in&s;tability of human affairs; teaches a due contempt of the world; propo&s;es con&s;olations a|gain&s;t the fear of death, and gives us a view of eternal happine&s;s. Much about this time he wrote the Flowers of Sion in ver&s;e. Though the num|bers in which the&s;e poems are wrote are not now very fa&s;hionable, yet the harmony is excellent, and during the reign of King James and Charles I. we have met with no poet who &s;eems to have had a better ear, or felt more intimately the pa&s;&s;ion he de&s;cribes. The writer of his life already men|tioned, ob&s;erves, that notwith&s;tanding his clo&s;e re|tirement, love &s;tole upon him, and entirely &s;ub|dued his heart. He needed not to have a&s;&s;igned retirement as a rea&s;on why it &s;hould &s;eem &s;trange that love grew upon him, &s;or retirement in its own nature is the very parent of love. When a man conver&s;es with but few ladies, he is apt to fall in love with her who charms him mo&s;t; whereas were his attention di&s;&s;ipated, and his af|fections bewildered by variety, he would be pre|&s;erved from love by not being able to fix them; which is one rea&s;on why we always find people in the country have more enthu&s;ia&s;tic notions of love, than tho&s;e who move in the hurry of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e. This beautiful young lady, with whom Mr. Drummond was enamoured, was daughter of Mr. Cunning|ham of Barnes, of an ancient and honourable family. He made his addre&s;&s;es to her in the true &s;pirit of gallantry, and as he was a gentle|man
<PB N="305" REF="310">
who had &s;een the world, and con&s;equently was accompli&s;hed in the elegancies of life, he was not long in exciting proper returns of pa&s;&s;ion; he gained her affections, and when the day of the marriage was appointed, and all things ready for its &s;olemnization, &s;he was &s;eized with a fever, and &s;natched from him, when his imagination had figured tho&s;e &s;cenes of rapture which naturally fill the mind of a bridegroom. As our author was a poet, he no doubt was capable of forming &s;till a greater ideal fealt, than a man of ordina|ry genius, and as his mi&s;tre&s;s was, as Rowe ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'more than painting can expre&s;s, or youthful poets fancy when they love,'</Q> tho&s;e who have felt that delicate pa&s;&s;ion, may be able in &s;ome mea&s;ure to judge of the &s;everity of di&s;tre&s;s into which our poetical bridegroom was now plunged: After the fervours of &s;orrow had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ub&s;ided, he expre&s;&s;ed his grief for her in &s;everal letters and poems, and with more pa&s;&s;ion and &s;incerity celebrated his dead mi&s;tre&s;s, than others prai&s;e their living ones. This extra|ordinary &s;hock occa&s;ioned by the young lady's death, on whom he doated with &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;s, &s;o affected his &s;pirits, that in order as much as po&s;|&s;ible to endeavour to forget her, he quitted his retirement, and re&s;ided eight years at Paris and Rome; he travelled through Germany, France and Italy, where he vi&s;ited all the famous univer&s;ities, conver&s;ed with the learned men, and made an ex|cellent collection of the be&s;t ancient Greek, and of the modern Spani&s;h, French, and Italian books. Mr. Drummond, though a &s;cholar and a man of genius, did not think it beneath him to improve him&s;elf in tho&s;e gay accompli&s;hments which are &s;o peculiar to the French, and which ne|ver fail to &s;et off wit and parts to the be&s;t ad|vantage. He &s;tudied mu&s;ic, and is reported to have
<PB N="306" REF="311">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the genteel accompli&s;hment of dancing, to no incon&s;iderable degree.</P>
<P>After a long &s;tay of eight years abroad, he returned again to his native country, where a civil war was ready to break out. He then found that as he could be of no &s;ervice by his action, he might at lea&s;t by his retirement, and during the confu&s;ion, he went to the &s;eat of his Brother-in-law, Sir John Scott, of Scotts Tarvat, a man of learning and good &s;en&s;e. In this interval it is &s;uppo&s;ed he wrote his Hi&s;|tory of the Five James's, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Kings of Scotland, which is &s;o excellent a work, whether we con&s;ider the exact conduct of the &s;tory, the judicious reflections, and the fine language, that no Hi&s;torian either of the Engli&s;h or Scotch nation (the lord Clarendon excepted) has &s;hewn a hap|pier talent for that &s;pecies of writing, which tho' it does not demand the highe&s;t genius, yet is as difficult to attain, as any other kind of literary excellence. This work was received in England with as much applau&s;e, as if it had been written by a countryman of their own, and about Eng|li&s;h affairs. It was fir&s;t publi&s;hed &s;ix or &s;even years after the author's death, with a preface, or introduction by Mr. Hall of Grays Inn, who, tho' not much di&s;po&s;ed to think favourably of the Scotch nation, has yet thus done ju&s;tice to Mr. Drummond; for his manner of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ting, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"though he treats of things that are rather many than great, and rather trouble&s;ome than glorious; yet he has brought &s;o much of the main toge|ther, as it may be mode&s;tly &s;aid, none of that nation has done before him, and for his way of handling it, he has &s;ufficiently made it appear, how conver&s;ant he was with the writings of ve|nerable antiquity, and how generou&s;ly he has emulated them by a happy imitation, for the purity of that language is much above the di|alect
<PB N="307" REF="312">
he wrote in; his de&s;criptions lively and full, his narrations clear and pertinent, his ora|tions eloquent, and fit for the per&s;ons who &s;peak, and his reflections &s;olid and mature, &s;o that it cannot be expected that the&s;e leaves can be turned over without as much plea&s;ure as pro|fit, e&s;pecially meeting with &s;o many glories, and trophies of our ance&s;tors."</Q> In this hi&s;to|ry Mr. Drummond has chiefly followed bi&s;hop El|phi&s;ton, and has given a different turn to things from Buchanan, whom a party of the Scotch ac|cu&s;e of being a pen&s;ioner of Queen Elizabeth's, and as he joined intere&s;t with the earl of Mur|ray, who wanted to di&s;turb the reign of his much injured &s;i&s;ter Mary Queen of Scots, he is &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected of being a party writer, and of having mi&s;repre&s;ented the Scotch tran&s;actions of old, in or|der to &s;erve &s;ome &s;cheme of policy.</P>
<P>In the &s;hort notes which Mr. Drummond has left behind him in his own life, he &s;ays, that he was the fir&s;t in the i&s;land that ever celebrated a dead mi&s;tre&s;; his poems con&s;i&s;t chiefly of Love-Ver&s;es, Madigrals, Epigrams, Epitaphs, &amp;c. they were highly e&s;teemed by his contemporaries both for the wit and learning that &s;hone in them. Ed|ward Philips, Milton's nephew, writes a preface to them, and ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that his poems are the effects of genius, the mo&s;t polite and verdant that ever the Scots nation produced, and &s;ays, that if he &s;hould affirm, that neither Ta&s;&s;o, Guarini, or any of the mo&s;t neat and refined &s;pirits of Italy, nor even the choice&s;t of our Engli&s;h poets can chalienge any advantage above him, it could not be judged any attribute &s;uperior to what he de&s;erves; and for his hi&s;tory he &s;ays, had there been nothing el&s;e extant of his writings, con&s;ider but the language how florid and ornate it is; con&s;ider the order and prudent conduct of the &s;tory, and you will rank him in the num|ber

<P>In order to divert him&s;elf and his friends, he wrote a &s;mall poem which he called Polemio-Middinia; 'tis a &s;ort of Macronic poetry, in which the Scots words are put in Latin terminations. In Queen Anne's time it was reprinted at Oxford, with a preface concern|ing Macronic poetry. It has been often reprinted in Scotland, where it is thought a very humo|rous performance.</P>
<P>Our author, who we have already &s;een, &s;uffered &s;o much by the immature fate of his fir&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, thought no more of love for many years after her de|cea&s;e, but &s;eeing by accident one Elizabeth Logan, grandchild to Sir Robert Logan, who by the great re&s;emblance &s;he bore to his fir&s;t favourite, rekindled again the flame of love; &s;he was beautiful in his eyes becau&s;e &s;he recalled to his mind the dear image of her he mourned, and by this lucky &s;imilarity &s;he captivated him. Though he was near 45 years of age, he married this lady; &s;he bore to him &s;e|veral children; William, who was knighted in Charles II's time; Robert, and Elizabeth, who was married to one Dr. Hender&s;on, a phy&s;ician at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>In the time of the public troubles, Mr. Drummond, be&s;ides compo&s;ing his hi&s;tory, wrote &s;everal tracts a|gain&s;t the mea&s;ures of the covenanters, and tho&s;e en|gaged in the oppo&s;ition of Charles I. In a piece of his called Irene, he harangues the King, nobility, gentry, clergy and commons, about their mutual mi&s;takes, jealou&s;ies and fears; he lays before them the di&s;mal con&s;equences of a civil war, from indi&s;puta|ble
<PB N="309" REF="314">
arguments, and the hi&s;tories of pa&s;t times. The great marquis of Montro&s;e writ a letter to him, de&s;iring him to print this Irene, as the be&s;t means to quiet the minds of the di&s;tracted people; he likewi&s;e &s;ent him a protection, dated Au|gu&s;t, 1645, immediately after the battle of Kyl|&s;yth, with another letter, in which he highly commends Mr. Drummond's learning and loyalty. Be&s;ides this work of Irene, he wrote the Load Star, and an Addre&s;s to the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, &amp;c. who leagued them&s;elves for the defence of the liberties and religion of Scotland, the whole purport of which is, to calm the di&s;turbed minds of the populace, to rea&s;on the better &s;ort into loyalty, and to check the growing evils which he &s;aw would be the con&s;equence of their beha|viour. Tho&s;e of his own countrymen, for whom he had the greate&s;t e&s;teem, were Sir William Alex|ander, afterwards earl of Stirling, Sir Robert Carr, afterwards earl of Ancram, from whom the pre&s;ent marquis of Lothian is de&s;cended, Dr. Ar|thur John&s;ton, phy&s;ician to King Charles I. and author of a Latin Paraphra&s;e of the P&s;alms, and Mr. John Adam&s;on, principal of the college of Edinburgh. He had great intimacy and corre|&s;pondence with the two famous Engli&s;h poets, Michael Drayton, and Ben John&s;on, the latter of whom travelled from London on foot, to &s;ee him at his &s;eat at Hawthornden. During the time Ben remained with Mr. Drummond, they often held conver&s;ation about poetry and poets, and Mr. Drummond has pre&s;erved the heads of what pa&s;&s;ed between them; and as part of it is very curious, and &s;erves to illu&s;trate the cha|racter of John&s;on, we have in&s;erted it in his life: though it perhaps was not altogether fair in Mr. Drummond, to commit to writing things that pa&s;&s;ed over a bottle, and which perhaps were heedle&s;ly advanced. It is certain &s;ome of the par|ticulars
<PB N="310" REF="315">
which Mr. Drummond has pre&s;erved, are not much in Ben's favour, and as few people are &s;o wi&s;e as not to &s;peak imprudently &s;ometimes, &s;o it is not the part of a man, who invites another to his table, to expo&s;e what may there drop inadvertent|ly; but as Mr. Drummond had only made memo|randums, perhaps with no re&s;olution to publi&s;h them, he may &s;tand acquitted of part of this charge. It is reported of our author that he was very &s;mart, and witty in his repartecs, and had a mo&s;t excellent talent at extempore ver&s;ifying, above any po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t of his time. In the year 1645, when the plague was raging in Scotland, our author came accidentally to Forfar, but was not allowed to enter any hou&s;e, or to get lodging in the town, though it was very late; he went two miles &s;urther to Kirrimeir, where he was well received, and kindly entertained. Being informed that the towns of Forfar and Kirrimuir had a conte&s;t a|bout a piece of ground called the Muirmo&s;s, he wrote a letter to the Provo&s;t of Forfar, to be com|municated to the town-council in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ha&s;te: It was imagined this letter came from the E&s;tates, who were then &s;itting at St. Andrew's; &s;o the Com|mon-Council was called with all expedition, and the mini&s;ter &s;ent for to pray for direction and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in an&s;wering the letter, which was opened in a &s;olemn manner. It contained the following lines,<Q><L>The Kirrimorians and For&s;orians met at Muir|mo&s;s,</L>

<L><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Shoemakers.</NOTE>Sutors ye are, and &s;utors ye'll be</L>
<L>T&mdash;y upon Forfar, Kirrimuir bears the gree.</L></Q></P>
<P>By this innocent piece of mirth he revenged him&s;elf on the town of Forfar. As our author was
<PB N="311" REF="316">
a great cavalier, and addicted to the King's party, he was forced by the reformers to &s;end men to the army which fought again&s;t the King, and his e&s;tate lying in three different counties, he had not occa&s;ion to &s;end one entire man, but halves, and quarters, and &s;uch like fractions, that is, the money levied upon him as his &s;hare, did not amount to the maintaining one man, but perhaps half as much, and &s;o on through the &s;everal counties, where his e&s;tates lay; upon this he wrote the following ver&s;es to the King.<Q><L>Of all the&s;e forces, rais'd again&s;t the King,</L>
<L>'Tis my &s;trange hap not one whole man to bring,</L>

<P>Being reputed a malignant, he was extremely harra&s;&s;ed by the prevailing party, and for his ver&s;es and di&s;cour&s;es frequently &s;ummoned before their circular tables.

His lord&s;hip enjoyed the place of &s;e|cretary with the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed reputation, for the &s;pace of fifteen years, even to his death, which happened on the 12th of February, 1640.</P>
<P>Our author married the daughter of Sir William Er&s;kine, Baronet, cou&s;in german to the earl of Marr, then Regent of Scotland; by her he had one &s;on, who died his Maje&s;ty's Re&s;ident in Nova Scotia in the life time of his father, and left be|hind him a &s;on who &s;ucceeded his grandfather in the title of earl of Stirling.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip is author of four plays, which he &s;tiles Monarchic Tragedies, viz. The Alexandraean Tragedy, Crae&s;us, Darius, and Julius Cae&s;ar, all which in the opinion of the ingenious Mr. Coxeter (who&s;e indefatigable indu&s;try in collecting materi|als for this work, which he lived not to publi&s;h, has furni&s;hed the pre&s;ent Biographers with many circum&s;tances they could not otherwi&s;e have known) were written in his lord&s;hip's youth, and before he undertook any &s;tate employment.</P>
<P>The&s;e plays are written upon the model of the ancients, as appears by his introducing the Chorus between the Acts; they are grave and &s;ententious throughout, like the Tragedies of Seneca, and yet the &s;ofter and tender pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ometimes very delicately touched. The author has been very un|happy in the choice of his ver&s;e, which is alter|nate, like the quatrains of the French poet Pi|brach, or Sir William Davenant's heroic poem call|ed Gondibert, which kind of ver&s;e is certainly un|natural for Tragedy, as it is &s;o much removed from pro&s;e, and cannot have that beautiful &s;implicity,

that tender pathos, which is indi&s;pen&s;ible to the language of tragedy; Mr. Rymer has critici&s;ed with great judgment on this error of our author, and &s;hewn the extreme ab&s;urdity of writing plays in rhime, notwith&s;tanding the great authority of Dryden can be urged in its defence.</P>
<P>Writing plays upon the model of the ancients, by introducing choru&s;&s;es, can be defended with as little force. It is the nature of a tragedy to warm the heart, rouze the pa&s;&s;ions, and fire the imagination, which can never be done, while the &s;tory goes languidly on. The &s;oul cannot be agi|tated unle&s;s the bu&s;ine&s;s of the play ri&s;es gradu|ally, the &s;cene be kept bu&s;y, and leading characters active: we cannot better illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation, than by an example.</P>

Want of pa&s;&s;ion and regard to character, is the error of our pre&s;ent dra|matic poets, and it is a true ob&s;ervation made by a gentleman in an occa&s;ional prologue, &s;peaking of the wits from Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es II. to our own times, he &s;ays,<Q><L>From bard, to bard, the frigid caution crept,</L>

<P>The Alexandraean Tragedy is built upon the differences about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that ro&s;e between Alexander's captains after his decea&s;e; he has borrowed many thoughts, and tran&s;lated whole &s;peeches from Seneca, Virgil, &amp;c.

Upon the whole it mu&s;t be allowed that his lord&s;hip was a very good hi&s;torian, for the reader may learn from it a great deal of the affairs of Greece and Rome; for the plot &s;ee Quintus Curtius, the thirteenth Book of Ju&s;tin, Diodorus Siculus, Jo&s;ephus, Raleigh's Hi&s;tory, &amp;c. The Scene is in Babylon.</P>
<P>Crae&s;us, a Tragedy; the Scene of this Play is laid in Sardis, and is reckoned the mo&s;t moving of the four; it is chiefly borrowed from Herodotus, Clio, Ju&s;tin, Plutarch's Life of Solon, Salian, Tor|niel. In the fifth Act there is an Epi&s;ode of A|bradates and Panthaea, which the author has taken from Xenophon's Cyropaedeia, or The Life and Education of Cyrus, lib. vii. The ingenious Scu|dery has likewi&s;e built upon this foundation, in his diverting Romance called the Grand Cyrus.</P>
<P>Darius, a Tragedy; this was his lord&s;hip's fir&s;t dramatic performance; it was printed at Edin|burgh in 4to. in the year 1603; it was fir&s;t com|po&s;ed of a mixture of Engli&s;h and Scotch dialect, and even then was commended by &s;everal copies of ver&s;es. The Scene of this Play is laid in Baby|lon. The author afterwards not only poli&s;hed his native language, but altered the Play it&s;elf; as to the plot con&s;ult Q.

Julius Cae&s;ar, a Tragedy. In the fifth Act of this Play, my lord brings Brutus, Ca&s;&s;ius, Cicero, An|thony, &amp;c. together, after the death of Cae&s;ar, almo&s;t in the &s;ame circum&s;tances Shake&s;pear has done in his Play of this name; but the difference between the Anthony and Brutus of Shake&s;pear, and the&s;e characters drawn by the earl of Stirling, is as great, as the genius of the former tran&s;cended the latter. This is the mo&s;t regular of his lord|&s;hip's plays in the unity of action. The &s;tory of this Play is to be found in all the Roman Hi&s;to|ries written &s;ince the death of that Emperor.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip has acknowledged the &s;tile of his dramatic works not to be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re, for which in ex|cu&s;e he has pleaded his country, the Scotch dialect then being in a very imperfect &s;tate. Having men|tioned the Scotch dialect, it will not be improper to ob&s;erve, that it is at this time much in the &s;ame degree of perfection, that the Engli&s;h language was, in the reigns of Henry VIII. and Queen Eli|zabeth; there are idioms peculiar to the Scotch, which &s;ome of their be&s;t writers have not been able entirely to forget, and unle&s;s they re&s;ide in England for &s;ome time, they &s;eldom overcome them, and their language is greatly ob&s;cured by the&s;e means; but the reputation which &s;ome Scotch writers at pre&s;ent enjoy, make it &s;ufficiently clear, that they are not much wanting in per&s;picuity or elegance, of which Mr. Hume, the ingenious author of E&s;|&s;ays Moral and Political, is an in&s;tance. In the particular quality of fire, which is indi&s;pen&s;ible in a good writer, the Scotch authors have rather too much of it, and are more apt to be extravagantly animated, than correctly dull.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Plays, our author wrote &s;everal other Poems of a different kind, viz. Doom&s;day, or the Great Day of the Lord's Judgment, fir&s;t printed 1614, and a Poem divided into 12 Book, which the author calls Hours; In this Poem is the following emphatic

<HEAD>JOSEPH HALL, Bi&s;hop of NOR|WICH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS prelate was born, according to his own account, July 11, 1574, in Bri&s;tow-Park, within the pari&s;h of A&s;hby de la Zouch, a town in Leice&s;ter&s;hire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Special<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ties of this bi&s;hop's life prefixed to his works.</NOTE>. His father was an officer under Henry Earl of Huntingdon, pre&s;ident of the North, who from his infancy had devoted him to the &s;ervice of the church; and his mother, whom he has celebrated for her exemplary and di&s;tingui&s;hed piety, was extremely &s;ollicitous that her favourite &s;on &s;hould be of a profe&s;&s;ion, &s;he her&s;elf held &s;o much in vene|ration. Our author, who &s;eems to have been very credulous in his di&s;po&s;ition, rather religious than wi&s;e, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any attainments equal to the dig|nity to which he ro&s;e, has pre&s;erved in his Specialities, &s;ome vi&s;ions of his mother's, which he relates with an air of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ufficient to evidence his own
<PB N="321" REF="326">
conviction of their reality; but as they appear to have been the offspring of a di&s;ordered imagination, they have no right to a place here.</P>
<P>In order to train him up to the mini&s;try, his fa|ther at fir&s;t re&s;olved to place him under the care of one Mr. Pel&s;et, lately come from Cambridge to be the public preacher at Leice&s;ter, who undertook to give him an education equally fini&s;hed with that of the univer&s;ity, and by the&s;e means &s;ave much ex|pence to his father: This re&s;olution, however, was not executed, &s;ome other friends advi&s;ing his fa|ther to &s;end him to Cambridge, and per&s;uaded him that no private tuition could po&s;&s;ibly be equal to that of the academical. When our author had remained &s;ix years at Cambridge, he had a right to preferment, and to &s;tand for a fellow&s;hip, had not his tutor Mr. Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">by been born in the &s;ame county with him, and the &s;tatutes not permitting two of the &s;ame &s;hire to enjoy fellow&s;hips, and as Mr. Gilby was &s;enior to our author, and already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Mr. Hall could not be promoted. In con|&s;equence of this, he propo&s;ed to remove, when the Earl of Huntingdon, being made acquaint|ed with this circum&s;tance, and hearing very favour|able accounts of our author, intere&s;ted him&s;elf to pre|vent his removal. He made application to Mr. Gil|by, promi&s;ed to make him his chaplain, and pro|mote him in the church, provided he would re|linqui&s;h his place in the college, in favour of Mr. Hall. The&s;e promi&s;es being made with &s;eeming &s;incerity, and as the Earl of Huntingdon was a man of reputation for probity, he complied with his lord&s;hip's reque&s;t, and relinqui&s;hed his place in the college. When he was about to enter upon his office of chaplain, to his great mortification, the nobleman on who&s;e promi&s;es he confided, and on whom he immediately depended, &s;uddenly died, by which accident he was thrown unprovided upon the world. This not a little affected Mr. Hall, who was
<PB N="322" REF="327">
&s;hocked to think that Mr. Gilby &s;hould be thus di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, by the genero&s;ity of his temper, which ex|cited him to quit a certainty in order to make way for his promotion. He addre&s;&s;ed Dr. Chadderton, then the ma&s;ter of the college, that the &s;ucceeding election might be &s;topped, and that Mr. Gilby &s;hould again po&s;&s;e&s;s his place; but in this reque&s;t he was un&s;ucce&s;sful: for the Doctor told him, that Mr. Gilby was dive&s;ted of all po&s;&s;ibilty of remedy, and that they mu&s;t proceed in the election the day following; when Mr. Hall was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en into that &s;ociety. Two years after this, he was cho|&s;en Rhetorician to the public &s;chools, where, as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was encouraged with a &s;ufficient frequence of auditors;"</Q> but this place be &s;oon re&s;igned to Dr. Dod, and entered upon &s;tu|dies nece&s;&s;ary to qualify him for taking orders.</P>
<P>Some time after this, the ma&s;ter&s;hip of a famous &s;chool erected at Tiverton in Devon, became vacant; this &s;chool was endowed by the founder Mr. Blundel, with a very large pen&s;ion, and the care of it was prin|cipally ca&s;t upon the then Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Popham. His lord&s;hip being intimately acquainted with Dr. Chadderton, reque&s;ted him to recommend &s;ome learned and prudent man for the government of that &s;chool. The Dr. recommended Mr. Hall, a&s;|&s;uring him that great advantage would ari&s;e from it, without much trouble to him&s;elf: Our author thinking proper to accept this, the Doctor carried him to London, and introduced him to Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Popham, who &s;eemed well plea&s;ed and thanked Dr. Chadderton for recommending a man &s;o well qualified for the charge. When Dr. Chadderton and Mr. Hall had taken leave of his lord&s;hip and were returning to their lodg|ings, a me&s;&s;enger pre&s;ented a letter to Mr. Hall, from lady Drury of Suffolk, earne&s;tly reque&s;ting him to accept the rectory of Hal&s;ted, a place in
<PB N="323" REF="328">
her gift. This flow of good fortune not a little &s;urprized him, and as he was governed by the max|ims of prudence, he made no long he&s;itation in accepting the latter, which was both a better be|nefice, and a higher preferment. Being &s;ettled at Hal&s;ted, he found there a dangerous antagoni&s;t to his mini&s;try, whom he calls in his Specialities, a witty, and a bold Athei&s;t: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This was one Mr. Lilly, who by rea&s;on of his travels, (&s;ays he) and abilities of di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour, had &s;o deeply in&s;inuated him&s;elf into my patron, that there were &s;mall hopes for me to work any good upon that noble patron of mine; who by the &s;ugge&s;tion of this wicked detractor, was &s;et off from me before he knew me. Hereupon, I confe&s;s, finding the obduredne&s;s, and hopele&s;s con|dition of that man, I bent my prayers again&s;t him, be&s;eeching God daily, that he would be plea&s;ed to remove by &s;ome means or other, that apparent hindrance of my faithful labours; who gave me an an&s;wer accordingly. For this malicious man going ha&s;tily up to London, to exa&s;perate my patron again&s;t me, was then and there &s;wept away by the pe&s;tilence, and never returned to do any further mi&s;chief."</Q> This account given by Mr. Hall of his antagoni&s;t, reflects no great honour upon him&s;elf: it is conceived in a &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s, and there is more of &s;pite a|gain&s;t Lilly's per&s;on in it, than any tenderne&s;s or pity for his errors. He calls him a witty Athei&s;t, when in all probability, what he terms athei&s;m, was no more than a freedom of thinking, and facetious conver&s;ation, which to the pious church|man, had the appearance of denying the exi&s;tence of God; be&s;ides, had Hall dealt candidly, he &s;hould have given his readers &s;ome more particulars of a man whom he was bold enough to denominate an Athei&s;t, a character &s;o very &s;ingular, that it &s;hould ne|ver be imputed to any man, without the &s;tronge&s;t

<P>Not long after Mr. Hall's &s;ettlement at Hal&s;ted, he was &s;ollicited by Sir Edmund Bacon to accom|pany him in a journey to the Spain Ardenna, at the time when the Earl of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rtford went amba&s;&s;ador to the archduke Albert of Bru&s;&s;els. This reque&s;t Mr. Hall complied with, as it furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of &s;eeing more of the world, and gra|tified a de&s;ire he had of conver&s;ing with the Romi&s;h Je&s;uits. The particulars of his journey, which he has pre&s;erved in his Specialities, are too trifling to be here in&s;erted: When he came to Bru&s;&s;els, he was introduced by an Engli&s;h gentleman, who prac|ti&s;ed phy&s;ic there, to the acquaintance of father Co&s;|trus, who held &s;ome conver&s;ation with him concern|ing the miracies &s;aid to be lately done, by one
<PB N="325" REF="330">
Lip&s;ieus Apricollis, a woman who lived at Zichem. From particular miracles, the father turned the di&s;|cour&s;e to the difference between divine and diabo|lical miracles; and he told Mr. Hall, that if he could a&s;certain that one miracle ever was wrought in the church of England, he would embrace that per&s;ua&s;ion: To which our author replied, that he was fully convinced, that many devils had been ejected out of per&s;ons in that church by fa&s;ting and prayer. They both believed the po&s;&s;ibility and frequency of miracles; they only differed as to the church in which miracles were performed. Hall has cen&s;ured father Co&s;trus, as a barren man, and of &s;uperficial conver&s;ation; and it is to be feared, that whoever reads Hall's religious works will conclude much in the &s;ame manner of him. They depar|ted from Bru&s;&s;els &s;oon after this interview between father Co&s;trus and our author, and met with no|thing in their journey to and return from the Spa, worth relation, only Mr. Hall had by his zeal in defending his own church, expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the re&s;entment of one Signior A&s;canio Negro, who be|gan notwith&s;tanding Mr. Hall's lay-habit, to &s;u&s;pect him to be a clergyman, and u&s;e &s;ome indecent free|doms with him in con&s;equence of this &s;u&s;picion. Our author to avoid any impertinence which the captain was likely to be guilty of towards him, told him, Sir Edmund Bacon, the per&s;on with whom he travelled, was the grandchild of the great lord Verulam, High Chancellor of England, who&s;e fame was extended to every country where &s;cience and philo&s;ophy prevailed, and that they were protected by the earl of Hertford, the Eng|li&s;h emba&s;&s;ador at Bru&s;&s;els. Upon the Italian's be|ing made acquainted with the quality of Sir Ed|mund, and the high connections of the two travel|lers, he thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from any acts of impertinence, to which bigotry and ignorance would have excited him.</P>

Hall returned to England after being ab|&s;ent eighteen months, and was received but coldly by Sir Robert Drury his patron; there having never been much friend&s;hip between them. In con&s;equence of this, Mr. Hall came to Lon|don, in &s;earch of a more comfortable provi&s;ion; he was &s;oon recommended by one Mr. Gurrey, tu|tor to the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, to preach before Prince Henry at Richmond. Before this accident Mr. Hall had been author of &s;ome Meditations, whom Mr. Gurrey told him, had been well received at Henry's court, and much read by that promi&s;ing young Prince. He preached with &s;ucce&s;s, for the Prince de&s;ired to hear him a &s;econd time, and was &s;o well plea&s;ed with him, that he &s;ignified an inclination of having him attend about his court. Mr. Hall's reputation growing, he was ta|ken notice of by per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, and &s;oon ob|tained the living of Waltham, pre&s;ented him by the Earl of Norwich.</P>
<P>While he exerci&s;ed his function at Waltham, the archdeacon of Norwich engaged him to in|tere&s;t him&s;elf in favour of the church of Wolver|hampton, from which a patrimony was detained by a &s;acrilegious conveyance. In the cour&s;e of this pro&s;ecution, our author ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a mar|vellous light opened it&s;elf unexpectedly, by re|vealing a counter&s;eit &s;eal, in the manife&s;tation of razures, and interpolations, and mi&s;dates of un|ju&s;tifiable evidences, that after many years &s;uit, Lord Chancellor Elle&s;mere, upon a full hearing, gave a decree in &s;avour of the church."</Q></P>
<P>During Mr. Hall's re&s;idence at Waltham, he was thrice employed by his Maje&s;ty in public &s;er|vice. His fir&s;t public employment was to attend the Earl of Carli&s;le, who went on an emba&s;&s;y to France, and during his ab&s;ence his Maje&s;ty conferred up|on him the deanery of Worce&s;ter. Upon his re|turn,
<PB N="327" REF="332">
he attended the King in a journey to Scot|land, where he exerted him&s;elf in &s;upport of epi&s;co|pacy, in oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;try there, who were Pre&s;byterians. Having acquired &s;ome name in polemical divinity, and being long ac|cu&s;tomed to di&s;putations, the King made choice of him to go to the Netherlands, and a&s;&s;i&s;t at the &s;y|nod of Dort, in &s;ettling the controverted points of faith, for which that reverend body were there convened. Hall has been very lavi&s;h in his own prai&s;e, while he acted at the &s;ynod of Dort; he has given many hints of the &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was ble&s;&s;ed with: he has informed us, that he was then in a langui&s;hing &s;tate of health; that his re&s;t was broken, and his nights &s;leeple&s;s; but on the night preceding the occa&s;ion of his preaching a Latin &s;ermon to the &s;ynod, he was favoured with refre&s;hing &s;leep, which he a&s;cribes to the imme|diate care of providence. The &s;tates of Holland, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ent Daniel Hein&s;ius the poet to vi&s;it him, and were &s;o much delighted with his com|portment, that they pre&s;ented him with a rich medal of gold, as a monument of their re&s;|pect for his poor endeavours."</Q> Upon our au|thor's returning home, he found the church torn to pieces, by the &s;ierce contentions which then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted concerning the doctrines of Arminius: he &s;aw this with concern, and was &s;en&s;ible true religion, piety, and virtue, could never be pro|moted by &s;uch altercation; and therefore with the little power of which he was ma&s;ter, he endea|voured to effect a reconciliation between the con|tending parties: he wrote what he calls a project of pacification, which was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, and would have had a very happy influence, had not the enemies of Mr. Hall mi&s;repre&s;ented the book, and &s;o far influenced the King, that a royal edict for a gene ral inhibition, buried it in &s;ilence. Hall after this
<PB N="328" REF="333">
contended with the Roman Catholics, who upon the pro&s;pect of the Spani&s;h match, on the &s;ucce&s;s of which they built their hopes, began to betray a great degree of in&s;olence, and proudly boa&s;t the pedigree of their church, from the apo&s;tles them|&s;elves. They in&s;i&s;ted, that as their church was the fir&s;t, &s;o it was the be&s;t, and that no ordination was valid which was not derived from it. Hall in an&s;wer to their a&s;&s;ertions, made a conce&s;&s;ion, which &s;ome of his Prote&s;tant brethren thought he had no right to do; he acknowledged the prio|rity of the Roman Church, but denied its infallibility, and con&s;equently that it was po&s;&s;ible another church might be more pure, and approach more to the apo&s;tolic practice than the Romi&s;h. This contro|ver&s;y he managed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he was pro|moted to the &s;ee of Exeter; and as King James I. &s;eldom knew any bounds to his genero&s;ity, when he happened to take a per&s;on into his favour, he &s;oon after that removed him from Exeter, and gave him the higher bi&s;hoprick of Norwich; which he enjoyed not without &s;ome allay to his happine&s;s, for the civil wars &s;oon breaking out, he underwent the &s;ame &s;everities which were ex|erci&s;ed again&s;t other prelates, of which he has given an account in a piece prefixed to his works, called, Hall's hard Mea&s;ure: and from this we &s;hall extract the mo&s;t material circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>The in&s;olence of &s;ome churchmen, and the &s;u|periority they a&s;&s;umed in the civil government, during the di&s;tractions of Charles I. provoked the Hou&s;e of Commons to take &s;ome mea&s;ures to pre|vent their growing power, which that pious mo|narch was too much di&s;po&s;ed to favour. In con&s;e|quence of this, the leading members of the op|po&s;ition petitioned the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ng to remove the bi&s;hops from their &s;eats in Parliament, and degrade them to the &s;tation of Commons, which was warmly
<PB N="329" REF="334">
oppo&s;ed by the high church lords, and the bi&s;hops them&s;elves, who prote&s;ted again&s;t whatever &s;teps were taken during their re&s;traint from Parliament, as illegal, upon this principle, that as they were part of the legi&s;lature, no law could pa&s;s during their ab&s;ence, at lea&s;t if that ab&s;ence was produ|ced by violence, which Clarendon has fully re|pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The prejudice again&s;t the epi&s;copal government gaining ground, petitions to remove the bi&s;hops were poured in from all parts of the kingdom, and as the earl of Strafford was then &s;o obnoxious to the popular re&s;entment, his cau&s;e and that of the bi&s;hops was reckoned by the vulgar, &s;ynoni|mous, and both felt the re&s;entment of an enraged populace. To &s;uch a fury were the common people wrought up, that they came in bodies to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, to crave ju&s;tice, both again&s;t the earl of Strafford, and the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, and, in &s;hort, the whole bench of &s;piri|tual Peers; the mob be&s;ieged the two Hou&s;es, and threatened vengeance upon the bi&s;hops, when|ever they came out. This fury excited &s;ome mo|tion to be made in the Hou&s;e of Peers, to pre|vent &s;uch tumults for the future, which were &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e of Commons. The bi&s;hops, for their &s;afety, were obliged to continue in the Parliament Hou&s;e the greate&s;t part of the night, and at la&s;t made their e&s;cape by bye-ways and &s;tratagems. They were then convinced that it was no longer &s;afe for them to attend the Parli|ament, 'till &s;ome mea&s;ures were taken to repre&s;s the in&s;olence of the mob, and in con&s;equence of this, they met at the hou&s;e of the archbi&s;hop of York, and drew up a prote&s;t, again&s;t whatever &s;teps &s;hould be taken during their ab&s;ence, occa|&s;ioned by violence. This prote&s;t, the bi&s;hops in|tended &s;hould fir&s;t be given to the Secretary of State, and by him to the King, and that his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="330" REF="335">
&s;hould cau&s;e it to be read in the Hou&s;e of Peers; but in place of this, the bi&s;hops were accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, brought before the bar of the Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ent to the Tower. During their confinement, their enemies in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, took occa&s;ion to bring in a bill for taking away the votes of bi&s;hops in the Hou&s;e of Peers: in this bill lord Falkland concurred, and it was &s;upported by Mr. Hambden and Mr. Pym, the oracles of the Hou&s;e of Commons, but met with great oppo&s;ition from Edward Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon, who was a friend to the church, and could not bear to &s;ee their liberties infringed.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hops petitioned to have council a&s;&s;igned them, in which they were indulged, in order to an&s;wer to the charge of high trea&s;on. A day was ap|pointed, the bi&s;hops were brought to the bar, but nothing was effected; the Hou&s;e of Commons at la&s;t finding that there could be no proof of high trea&s;on, dropt that charge, and were content to libel them for a mi&s;demeanor, in which they likewi&s;e but ill &s;ucceeded, for the bi&s;hops were admitted to bail, and no pro&s;ecution was carried on again&s;t them, even for a mi&s;demeanor.</P>
<P>Being now at liberty, the greate&s;t part of them retired to their dioce&s;es, 'till the &s;torm which had threatened them &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide. Bi&s;hop Hall repaired to Norwich, where he met, from the di&s;|affected party, a very cold reception; he conti|nued preaching however in his cathedral at Nor|wich, 'till the order of &s;eque&s;tration came down, when he was de&s;ired to remove from his palace, while the &s;eque&s;trators &s;eized upon all his e&s;tate, both real and per&s;onal, and appraized all the goods which were in the palace. The bi&s;hop relates the &s;ollowing in&s;tance of oppre&s;&s;ion which was inflicted on him; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'One morning (&s;ays his lord&s;hip) before my &s;ervants were up, there came to my gates one
<PB N="331" REF="336">
Wright, a London trooper, attended with others requiring entrance, threatening if they were not admitted, to break open the gates, whom, I found at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;truggling with one of my &s;ervants for a pi&s;tol which he had in his hand; I demanded his bu&s;ine&s;s at that un&s;ea&s;onable time; he told me he came to &s;earch for arms and ammuniti|on, of which I mu&s;t be di&s;armed; I told him I had only two mu&s;kets in the hou&s;e, and no o|ther military provi&s;ion; he not re&s;ting upon my word, &s;earched round about the hou&s;e, looked in|to the che&s;ts and trunks, examined the ve&s;&s;els in the cellar; finding no other warlike furniture, he asked me what hor&s;es I had, for his com|mi&s;&s;ion was to take them al&s;o; I told him how poorly I was &s;tored, and that my age would not allow me to travel on &s;oot; in conclu&s;ion, he took one hor&s;e away.'</Q></P>
<P>The committee of &s;eque&s;tration &s;oon after pro|ceeded to &s;trip him of all the revenue belonging to his &s;ee, and as he refu&s;ed to take the covenant, the magi&s;trates of the city of Norwich, who were no friends to epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, cited him be|fore them, for giving ordination unwarrantably, as they termed it: to this extraordinary &s;ummons the bi&s;hop an&s;wered, that he would not betray the dignity of his &s;tation by his per&s;onal appearance, to an&s;wer any complaints before the Lord Mayor, for as he was a Peer of the realm, no magi&s;trate whatever had a right to take cognizance of his conduct, and that he was only accountable to the Hou&s;e of Lords, of which he was one. The bi&s;hop proceeds to enumerate the various in&s;ults he re|ceived from the enraged populace; &s;ometimes they &s;earched his hou&s;e for malignants, at other times they threatened violence to his per&s;on; nor did their re&s;entment terminate here; they exerci&s;ed their fury in the cathedral, tore down the altar, broke the organ in pieces, and committed a kind of &s;a|crilegious

The&s;e are the mo&s;t ma|terial hard&s;hips which, according to the bi&s;hop's own account, happened to him, which he &s;eems to have born with patience and fortitude, and may &s;erve to &s;hew the violence of party rage, and that religion is often made a pretence for committing the mo&s;t outrageous in&s;olence, and horrid cru|elty. It has been already ob&s;erved, that Hall &s;eems to have been of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic turn of mind, which &s;eldom con&s;i&s;ts with any brilliance of genius; and in this ca&s;e it holds true, for in his &s;ermons ex|tant, there is an imbecility, which can flow from no other cau&s;e than w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of parts. In poetry how|ever he &s;eems to have greater power, which will appear when we con&s;ider him in that light.</P>
<P>It cannot po&s;itively be determined on what year bi&s;hop Hall died; he publi&s;hed that work of his called Hard Mea&s;ure, in the year 1647, at which time he was &s;eventy-three years of age, and in all probability did not long &s;urvive it.</P>

<P>All the&s;e are printed in 4to, and were publi&s;hed 1660. There are al&s;o other Works of this author. An Edition of the whole has been printed in three Vols. folio.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e works, Bi&s;hop Hall is author of Satires in Six Books, lately reprinted under the title of Virgidemiarum, of which we cannot give a better account than in the words of the ingenious authors of the Monthly Review, by which Bi&s;hop Hall's genius for that kind of poetical writing will fully appear.</P>
<P>He publi&s;hed the&s;e Satires in the twenty third year of his age, and was, as he him&s;elf a&s;&s;erts in the Prologue, the fir&s;t &s;atiri&s;t in the Engli&s;h lan|guage.<Q><L>I fir&s;t adventure, follow me who li&s;t,</L>
<L>And be the &s;econd Engli&s;h &s;atyri&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>And, if we con&s;ider the di&s;&s;iculty of introducing &s;o nice a poem as &s;atire into a nation, we mu&s;t al|low it required the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of no common and ordinary genius. The Italians had their Ario&s;to, and the French their Regnier, who might have &s;erved him as models for imitation; but he copies after the ancients, and chiefly Juvenal and Per&s;ius; though he wants not many &s;trokes of elegance and delicacy, which &s;hew him perfectly acquainted with the manner of Horace. Among the &s;everal di&s;|couragements which attended his attempt in that kind, he mentions one peculiar to the language and nature of the Engli&s;h ver&s;ification, which would appear in the tran&s;lation of one of Per&s;ius's
<PB N="335" REF="340">
Satires: The difficulty and di&s;&s;onance whereof, &s;ays he, &s;hall make good my a&s;&s;ertion; be&s;ides the plain experience thereof in the Satires of Ario&s;to; &s;ave which, and one ba&s;e French &s;atire, I could never attain the view of any for my direction. Yet we may pay him almo&s;t the &s;ame compliment which was given of old to Homer and Archilochus: for the improvements which have been made by &s;uc|ceeding poets bear no manner of proportion to the di&s;tance of time between him and them. The ver&s;es of bi&s;hop Hall are in general extremely mu|&s;ical and flowing, and are greatly preferable to Dr. Donne's, as being of a much &s;moother cadence; neither &s;hall we find him deficient, if compared with his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in point of thought and wit; but he exceeds him with re&s;pect to his characters, which are more numerous, and wrought up with greater art and &s;trength of colouring. Many of his lines would do honour to the mo&s;t ingenious of our modern poets; and &s;ome of them have thought it worth their labour to imitate him, e&s;pe|cially Mr. Oldham. Bi&s;hop Hall was not only our fir&s;t &s;atyri&s;t, but was the fir&s;t who brought e|pi&s;tolary writing to the view of the public; which was common in that age to other parts of Europe, but not practi&s;ed in England, till he publi&s;hed his own epi&s;tles. It may be proper to take notice, that the Virgidemiarum are not printed with his other writings, and that an account of them is omitted by him, through his extreme mode&s;ty, in the Specialities of his Life, prefixed to the third vo|lume of his works in folio.</P>
<P>The author's po&s;t&s;cript to his &s;atires is prefixed by the editor in the room of a preface, and with|out any apparent impropriety. It is not without &s;ome &s;ignatures of the bi&s;hop's good &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te; and, making a ju&s;t allowance for the u&s;e of a few ob&s;olete terms, and the puerile cu&s;tom

of that age in making affected repetitions and re|iterations of the &s;ame word within the compa&s;s of a period, it would read like no bad pro&s;e at pre|&s;ent. He had undoubtedly an excellent ear, and we mu&s;t conclude he mu&s;t have &s;ucceeded con&s;i|derably in erotic or pa&s;toral poetry, from the following &s;tanza's, in his Defiance to Envy, which may be con&s;idered as an exordium to his poetical writings.<Q><LG>

<P>The fir&s;t three books of &s;atires are termed by the author Toothle&s;s &s;atires, and the three la&s;t Bit|ing &s;atires.

<P>The fir&s;t &s;atire of the third book is a &s;trong con|tra&s;t of the temperance and &s;implicity of former ages, with the luxury and effeminacy of his own times, which a reflecting reader would be apt to think no better than the pre&s;ent.

<P>The fourth is levelled at O&s;tentation in devotion, or in dre&s;s.

'Tis pro|bable this might be about the time of their intro|duction into dre&s;s here.

<P>In his biting &s;atires he breathes &s;till more of the &s;pirit and &s;tile of Juvenal, his third of this book being an imitation of that &s;atiri&s;t's eighth, on Fa|mily-madne&s;s and Pride of De&s;cent; the beginning of which is not tran&s;lated ami&s;s by our author. The principal object of his fourth &s;atire, Gallio, would corre&s;pond with a modern Fribble, but that he &s;uppo&s;es him capable of hunting and hawking, which are exerci&s;es rather too coar&s;e and indeli|cate for ours: this may intimate perhaps, that the reign of the great Elizabeth had no character quite &s;o unmanly as our age.

<P>His fifth &s;atire contra&s;ts the extremes of Prodi|gality and Avarice; and by a few initials, which are &s;kabbarded, it looks as if he had &s;ome indi|viduals in view; though he has di&s;claimed &s;uch an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tention in his po&s;t&s;cript (now the preface) p. 6. l. n. 25, &amp;c.

The lines, which are far from inelegant, &s;eem indeed to come from his heart, and make him appear as an exception to that too general human di&s;content, which was the &s;ubject of this &s;atire.<Q><L>'Mong&s;t all the&s;e &s;tirs of di&s;contented &s;trife,</L>

<P>The la&s;t &s;atire of this book is a &s;evere one on the clergy of the church of Rome. He terms it POMH PYMH, by which we &s;uppo&s;e he intended to brand Rome, as the Sink of Super&s;tition.

<P>The &s;econd &s;atire la&s;hes the incongruity of &s;tately buildings and want of ho&s;pitality, and naturally reminds us of a plea&s;ant epigram of Martial's on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, where after de&s;cribing the magnifi|cence of a villa, he concludes however, there is no room either to &s;up or lodge in it. It ends with a tran&s;ition on the contumely with which the para&s;ites are treated at the tables of the great; being a pret|ty clo&s;e imitation of Juvenal on the &s;ame &s;ubject.

<P>In his third, titled, &Kgr;&Ogr;&Igr;&Ngr;&Agr; &PHgr;&Igr;&Lgr;&OHgr;&Ngr;, where he re|prehends Plato's notion of a political community of all things, are the following lines:<Q><L>Plato is dead, and dead is his device,</L>

<P>His la&s;t book and &s;atire, for it con&s;i&s;ts but of one, is a humorous ironical recantation of his former &s;atires; as the author pretends there can be no ju&s;t one in &s;uch perfect times as his own. The latter part of it alludes to different pa&s;&s;ages in Juvenal; and he particularly reflects on &s;ome poeta&s;ter he calls Labeo, whom he had repeatedly la&s;h'd before; and who was not improbably &s;ome cotemporary &s;cribler.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the&s;e &s;atires &s;ufficiently evince both the learning and ingenuity of their author.

The &s;en&s;e has generally &s;uch a &s;ufficient pau&s;e, and will admit of &s;uch a punctuation at the clo&s;e of the &s;econd line, and the ver&s;e is very often as harmo|nious too, as if it was calculated for a modern ear: tho' the great number of ob&s;olete words retained would incline us to think the editors had not pro|cured any very extraordinary alteration of the origi|nal edition, which we have never &s;een. The pre|&s;ent one is nearly printed; and, if it &s;hould oc|ca&s;ion another, we cannot think but a &s;hort glo&s;&s;ary at the end of it, or explanations at the bottom of the pages, where the mo&s;t uncouth and antiquated terms occur, would ju&s;tly increa&s;e the value of it, by adding con&s;iderably to the per&s;picuity of this wri|ter; who, in other re&s;pects, &s;eems to have been a learned divine, a con&s;cientious chri&s;tian, a lover of peace, and well endued with patience; for the exerci&s;e of which virtue, the confu&s;ions at the lat|ter end of his life, about the time of the death of Charles I. furni&s;hed him with frequent op|portunities, the account of his own hard mea&s;ures being dated in May 1647.

<HEAD>RICHARD CRASHAW.</HEAD>
<P>SON of an eminent divine named William Cra&s;haw, was educated in grammar learning in Sutton's-Ho&s;pital called the Charter-Hou&s;e, near London, and in academical, partly in Pem|broke-Hall, of which he was a &s;cholar, and af|terwards in Peterhou&s;e, Cambridge, of which he was a fellow, where, as in the former hou&s;e, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed for his Latin and Engli&s;h poe|try. Afterwards he took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts; but being &s;oon after thrown out of his fellow|&s;hip, with many others of the Univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge, for denying the Covenant during the time of the rebellion, he was for a time obliged to &s;hift for him&s;elf, and &s;truggle again&s;t want and oppre&s;&s;ion. At length being wearied with per|&s;ecution and poverty, and fore&s;eeing the calamity which threatened and afterwards fell upon his church and country, by the unbounded fury of the Pre&s;byterians, he changed his religion, and went beyond &s;ea, in order to recommend him&s;elf to &s;ome Popi&s;h preferment in Paris; but being a mere &s;cholar was incapable of executing his new plan of a livelihood. Mr. Abraham Cowley hearing of his being there, endeavoured to find him out, which he did, and to his great &s;urprize &s;aw him in a very mi&s;erable plight: this happened in the year 1646. This generous bard gave him all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could, and obtained likewi&s;e &s;ome relief for him from Henrietta Maria the Queen Dowager, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n re&s;iding at Paris. Our author receiving letters of recommendation from his Queen, he took a journey into Italy, and by
<PB N="345" REF="350">
virtue of tho&s;e letters became a &s;ecretary to a Car|dinal at Rome, and at length one of the canons or chaplains of the rich church of our lady of Lo|retto, &s;ome miles di&s;tant from thence, where he died in 1650.</P>
<P>This conduct of Cra&s;haw can by no means be ju&s;tified: when a man changes one religion for a|nother, he ought to do it at a time when no mo|tive of intere&s;t can well be &s;uppo&s;ed to have pro|duced it; for it does no honour to religion, nor to the per&s;on who becomes a convert, when it is evident, he would not have altered his opini|on, had not his party been &s;uffering; and what would have become of the church of England, what of the Prote&s;tant religion, what of chri&s;ti|anity in general, had the apo&s;tles and primitive martyrs, and later champions for truth, meanly a|bandoned it like Cra&s;haw, becau&s;e the hand of power was lifted up again&s;t it. It is an old ob|&s;ervation, that the blood of the martyrs is the &s;eed of the church; but Cra&s;haw took care that the church &s;hould reap no benefit by his per&s;e|verance. Before he left England he wrote poems, entitled, Steps to the Temple; and Wood &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he led his life in St. Mary's church near to Peterhou&s;e, where he lodged under Tertullian's roof of angels; there he made his ne&s;t more glad than David's &s;wallow near the hou&s;e of God, where like a primitive &s;aint he offered more prayers in the night than others u&s;ually offer in the day. There he pen'd the poems called Steps to the Temple for Happy Souls to climb to Heaven by. To the &s;aid Steps are joined other poems, entitled, The Delights of the Mu&s;es, wherein are &s;everal Latin poems; which tho' of a more humane mixture, yet are &s;weet as they are innocent.
