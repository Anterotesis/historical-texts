<P>THE eager and almo&s;t univer&s;al Curio&s;ity, which the late <HI>In&s;tallation</HI> of the <HI>Knights of the Order of the Garter</HI> excited in the <HI>Publick,</HI> &s;eemed in a manner to command our Attention, and ju&s;tify our Endeavors to exhibit a Repre&s;entation of it in the following Ma&s;que: The Difficulty was to give an adequate Idea, in a &s;mall Compa&s;s, of the various Circum&s;tances of this great Solemnity, con&s;i&s;ting of the <HI>In|&s;tallation, Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The late Mr. <HI>Gilbert We&s;t,</HI> publi&s;hed, &s;ome Years ago, a Dramatick Poem called <HI>The In&s;titution of the Order of the Garter,</HI> which has been much admired: It was, however, impo&s;&s;ible to bring it on the Stage as it was originally written, becau&s;e, though rich in Machinery, it was little more than a Poem in Dialogue without
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Action: Some &s;elect Parts of it however, with a few nece&s;&s;ary Alterations, and the Addition of &s;ome comic Scenes, were thought a proper Vehicle for the different Ceremonies of this great Fe&s;tival. The Scene is laid in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, who was the Founder of the Order, after having re&s;tored that of the <HI>Knights of the Round Table,</HI> which we have &s;uppo&s;ed, with &s;ome Writers, to be continued at the In&s;titution of the Garter.</P>
<P>No Expence has been &s;pared, nor, we hope, any Object of Attention overlooked, which might conduce to make the following Ma&s;que as &s;hort, as various, and as faithful to the original In&s;titution as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Songs, Choru&s;es, and Serious Dialogue are publi&s;hed, that they may be better under|der&s;tood from the Stage. The comic Parts which are intended merely for the Preparation of the principal Scenes, are not printed, as they would lo&s;e much of their Effect by being &s;eparated from the Action of the Performer.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>We&s;t,</HI> in order to give a greater Variety and to introduce &s;ome particular Characters into
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
his Poem, has taken (as he acknowleges in a Note) the Advantage of a Licence u&s;ually allowed to Poets, of departing a little from Chronology, and po&s;tponing the In&s;titution of the Order for a few Years.</P>
<P>Under the Sanction of this Authority, we have ventured to make u&s;e of the &s;ame poetical Licence, by throwing the In&s;titution of the Order as many Years backward, as Mr. <HI>We&s;t</HI> has brought it forward. We have made the Black Prince nine Years younger than he was, when he was Knighted; and we flatter our&s;elves that this Anachroni&s;m will be excu&s;ed for the Sake of the Application.</P>
<P>Some other Liberties of le&s;s Con&s;equence are nece&s;&s;arily taken for the Sake of rendering the whole more Theatrical; we have had too long an Experience of the publick Indulgence, not to know that they will be readily over|looked, &s;hould the re&s;t of the Performance have the good Fortune to be approved.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The following</HI> EXTRACTS <HI>from</HI> Selden's Titles of Honor, <HI>and</HI> A&s;hmole's Order of the Garter, <HI>are in&s;erted to &s;hew the Authority upon which we have founded &s;ome Part of our</HI> In&s;tallation.</HEAD>
<Q><P>AND &s;o much the rather al&s;o, becau&s;e we know by others of our own country, that in the &s;elf-&s;ame year, a &s;olemn and great meeting of Knights was appointed by the King at Wind&s;or Ca&s;tle, for the &s;et|ting up of his <HI>Round Table</HI> there, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems that out of the plot and purpo&s;e of this <HI>Round Table</HI> at Wind&s;or, erected in the &s;ame year wherein the Order of the New Garter was in&s;tituted and appointed to be celebrated on St. George's day of the &s;ame year, as we may collect out of Froi&s;&s;art al&s;o, the Order it&s;elf had chief part at lea&s;t of its original. And the other traditions touching the Garter of the Queen, or of the Counte&s;s of Kent and Sali&s;bury, may well &s;tand with this, thus far, that the word and the u&s;e of the Garter, began as the traditions &s;uppo&s;e, but that the Order was rai&s;ed chiefly out of this of the <HI>Round Table</HI> of that time, as out of a Seminary. For the <HI>Round Table</HI> was in &s;pecial u&s;e in tho&s;e ages, for the drawing together of the braver Knights and Ladies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Froi&s;&s;art likewi&s;e &s;ays, <HI>Et ordonna</HI> (Edward the Third) <HI>que d'an en an le jour Saint Gregore, s'en feroit la fe&s;te dedans le chateau de Vinde&s;ore, le quell chateau le Roy Artur avoit fait faire autreffois edifier et in icelui tenir la noble Table ronde,</HI> &amp;c.</P><BIBL>SELDEN, edit. 1672. pag. 658.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>King Edward the Third having de&s;igned to re&s;tore the honor of the <HI>Round Table,</HI> held a ju&s;te at Wind&s;or, in the 18th year of his reign, (but there is an old manu|&s;cript chronicle that has the&s;e words: King Edward in his 19th year begun his <HI>Round Table,</HI> and ordained the
<PB N="15" REF="21">
day annually to be kept there at Whit&s;untide) and this meeting, in truth, occa&s;ioned the foundation of the mo&s;t noble Order of the Garter, as &s;hall be noted by and by.</P><BIBL><HI>A&s;hmole,</HI> edit. 1672, pag. 96.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><P>He (Edward the Third) did thereupon fir&s;t de&s;ign (as being invited thereto by its antient fame) the re&s;tauration of King Arthur's <HI>Round Table,</HI> which he exhibited with magnificent ha&s;tiludes and general ju&s;ts, to invite hither the gallant and active &s;pirits from abroad; and upon di&s;covery of their courage and abi|lity in the exerci&s;e of arms, to draw them to his party, and oblige them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Though King Edward &s;o far advanced the honor of a Garter, as that the Order did derive its title and denomination from it; yet it is mo&s;t evident, that he founded this more famous Order, not to give reputa|tion to, or perpetuate an effeminate occa&s;ion, but to adorn martial virtue with honor, rewards, and &s;plen|dor: to increa&s;e virtue and valour in the hearts of his nobility; or, as Andrew du Che&s;ne &s;aith, to honor military virtue with &s;ome glorious favours and rewards; that &s;o true nobility (as is noted in the preface to the black book of the Order) after long and hazardous adventures, &s;hould not enviou&s;ly be deprived of that honor which it hath really de&s;erved; and that active and hardy youth might not want a &s;pur in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of virtue, which is to be e&s;teemed glorious and eternal.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e grounds no doubt does our learned Selden affirm, that this Order was rai&s;ed chiefly out of the <HI>Round Table</HI> of that time (the Knights thereof being in the flower of that age) as out of a &s;eminary. </P><BIBL><HI>A&s;hmole,</HI> page 182.</BIBL></Q>
