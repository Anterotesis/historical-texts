<HEAD>AN AFFECTIONATE ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SUFFER a word of exhortation from a heart that knows its own bitterne&s;s, and grones under the ruins of a &s;inful nature and di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions. Permit one who freely owns, with grief and &s;hame, that he is naturally of a very ha&s;ty temper and pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;|po&s;ition, to addre&s;s you, on the evil of indulging and giving way to this. In this attempt I humbly crave your mo&s;t &s;erious attention and affectionate regard, hoping herein mine eye is &s;ingly directed to our Lord's glory, and my heart &s;incerely engaged for your &s;piritual good and my own. Bear with my freedom, as I a&s;&s;ure you, I de&s;ire to write from <HI>my own</HI> &s;en&s;e and experience of this evil, as well from ob&s;ervation of it in others. would apply to <HI>my own &s;oul</HI> all that I write to you; and de&s;ire to fall under every conviction <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> which I may bring again&s;t you.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, you mu&s;t, you will join me, in freely confe&s;&s;ing, that to indulge and exalt a &s;pirit and temper contrary to meekne&s;s and quietne&s;s, is as oppo&s;ite to our profe&s;&s;ion of being di&s;ciples and followers of the meek and lowly Je&s;us, as light is to darkne&s;s, or heaven to hell; and that &s;uch a conduct is to be condemned. But yet, how many &s;uch profe&s;&s;ors do day after day, live and act under the power of their uncontrouled tem|pers, and un&s;ubdued pa&s;&s;ions of bitter anger, furious wrath, and unbridled re&s;entment? Yes, and what is mo&s;t to be lamented, they do not &s;eem to &s;ee the lea&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y">
evil in all this, are not humbled for it, nor are they &s;tri|ving again&s;t it; but are rather &s;aying, I do well to be angry. They find excu&s;es to palliate the evil, and to ju&s;tify their bad conduct. O, my brethren, the&s;e things ought not &s;o to be! Who can ob&s;erve, without great concern of mind and grief of &s;oul, what advantage &s;atan gets over &s;uch? One would therefore &s;incerely wi&s;h to drop a word in &s;ea&s;on to &s;uch.</P>
<P>In order therefore, through the ble&s;&s;ing of our Lord, to fa&s;ten conviction upon your heart and mine for, and to prevent &s;uch conduct, the Lord help us to con&s;ider,</P>

<P N="1">1. As to the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a meek and quiet &s;pirit. It is the offspring of heaven&mdash;the gift of God&mdash;a fruit of the Holy Spirit&mdash;obtained for us by the blood of Je&s;us&mdash;conferred on us, when we are born into him by his Spirit, and made new creatures in him, thro' the faith of the operation of God; and is enjoyed by walking in fel|low&s;hip with God the Father, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Hence, no marvel, that Peter &s;ays, "The ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit is in the &s;ight of God of great price," 1 Pet. iii. 4. The nece&s;&s;ity of putting it on, and adorning our&s;elves with it, from day to day, and from hour to hour, under all circum&s;tances and appearance of things, mu&s;t be allowed to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, if we have any regard to the glory of God our loving Father; any concern for the honor of Je&s;us our meek and lowly Saviour; any de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s the peace of faith, the joy of hope, the comfort of love, and the witne&s;s of God the Holy Spirit in our own hearts; any
<PB N="5" REF="4">
zeal for the credit of our mo&s;t holy religion, to make it honorable in the &s;ight of our brethren, and to recom|mend it to the world. A real, undi&s;&s;embled regard to all this, is clo&s;ely connected with, and enters into the very e&s;&s;ence of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a meek and quiet &s;pirit. Therefore, con&s;ider,</P>
<P>1&s;t. The ble&s;&s;edne&s;s it is of to our own &s;ouls. For there are many great and precious promi&s;es which be|long to, and which meek and quiet &s;pirits may joyfully claim, and be comforted by. But pride avaunt. For thou art at the bottom of every evil temper and &s;inful pa&s;|&s;ion. Think not that any one promi&s;e is made to us, or belongs to us for and on account of any inherent meekne&s;s of &s;pirit, or quietne&s;s of temper we are na|turally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. No. The promi&s;es are ALL IN CHRIST JESUS; are all made to him, as our covenant head, for and in behalf of all his members. "Unto us are <HI>given</HI> exceeding great and precious promi&s;es," 2 Pet. i. 4. Us! Who? even all who have obtained precious faith in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who are in him, united to him, and are one with him; partakers of the divine nature, &s;o as to re|&s;emble it, and be made comformable to it. "Behold, thy King cometh unto thee <HI>meek,"</HI> Matt. xxi. 3. When we receive our meek King Je&s;us into our hearts by faith, we then partake of his meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s, our &s;pirit is changed and conformed in our mea&s;ure into his. Then we find, all the exceeding great and precious pro|mi&s;es, which are in him, to be ours al&s;o We claim them in him; and, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t, we may, we ought joyfully to take them to our&s;elves. Hear, rejoice, and comfortably apply them, O ye meek &s;pirited &s;inners! <Q>The <HI>meek</HI> will he guide in judgment, and the <HI>meek</HI> will he teach his way, <BIBL>P&s;alm xxv. 9.</BIBL></Q> <Q>The LORD lifteth up the <HI>meek,</HI> <BIBL>cxlvii. 6.</BIBL></Q> <Q>He will beautify the <HI>meek</HI> with &s;alvation, <BIBL>cxlix. 4.</BIBL></Q> <Q>The <HI>meek</HI> &s;hall increa&s;e their
<PB N="6" REF="5" MS="y">
joy in the LORD, <BIBL>I&s;aiah xxix. 19.</BIBL></Q> Chri&s;t preaches good tidings to the <HI>meek,</HI> lxi. 1. and pronounces them ble&s;&s;ed, Matt. v. 5. Such is the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the meek.</P>
<P>Now by the <HI>meek,</HI> in all the&s;e places, and throughout the word of God is meant, the poor in &s;pirit, the lowly in their own eyes, tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of their own need and mi&s;ery, are humbled for it, and live under an abiding &s;en&s;e of it None are real di&s;ciples of Je&s;us but &s;uch. None are the children of God by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us but &s;uch. None will cleave to and follow our Sa|viour but &s;uch. None but &s;uch, will have any regard to honor and glorify him in the world. None but &s;uch, can apply and enjoy the promi&s;es which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to have the wit|ne&s;s of the Spirit with his &s;pirit, that he is a child of God, that his &s;ins are pardoned in the blood of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s he is living and walking in lowline&s;s of mind, po|verty of &s;pirit, and meekne&s;s of temper. But the ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of tho&s;e who are of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, con&s;i&s;ts in the enjoyment of the comforts of the exceeding great and precious promi&s;es which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Yea and Amen, &s;ure and certain to all the heirs of promi&s;e, to the glory of God. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P>2dly, Tho&s;e who are of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, are a ble&s;&s;ing and comfort to others. For they adorn the go&s;|pel of God our Saviour, rejoice the hearts of their bre|thren in Chri&s;t, and cau&s;e the way of truth to be well-&s;poken of in the world. O how &s;weet is the company and conver&s;ation of a meek, lowly, poor in &s;pirit &s;inner! He is ever breathing a &s;weet &s;avor of the dear Redeemer's matchle&s;s love, rich grace, precious atonement, &s;potle&s;s righteou&s;ne&s;s, and fini&s;hed &s;alvation to others; yea, and though proud, &s;tout-hearted, &s;elf-righteous &s;inners, do not approve of his faith and hope in the &s;alvation of Chri&s;t, yet by his &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and &s;oftne&s;s of be|havior, in gentlene&s;s, &s;hewing all meekne&s;s to all men,
<PB REF="6" MS="y">
and in meekne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them&s;elves, they will at lea&s;t be won to think, there is a certain &s;omething which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, which is truly amiable and prai&s;e worthy, and which de&s;erves imitation. And how happy does &s;uch a &s;oul make tho&s;e around him, or who dwell under the &s;ame roof with him? If a hu&s;band, the meekne&s;s and quietne&s;s of his &s;pirit, will not only be an example, but a ble&s;&s;ing and comfort to the wife of his bo&s;om. If a wife, &s;he will be &s;o to her hu&s;band. If a parent, the &s;ame to his or her children. If a ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s, the &s;ame to his or her &s;ervants; and &s;o each will be to the other in every &s;tation and relation. Well then might Paul exhort, "I be&s;eech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowline&s;s and meekne&s;s, with long-&s;uffering, forbearing one another in love," Eph. iv. 1, 2. But, above all,</P>
<P>3dly, Such are ble&s;&s;ed, in that they honor Chri&s;t and glorify the God of their &s;alvation. By the meekne&s;s of your &s;pirit and quietne&s;s of your temper, you make it manife&s;t, that Je&s;us is a Saviour, a real Saviour, a pre&s;ent Saviour, that you have been with him, and learned of him, and that he has &s;aved you from the proud, boi&s;te|rous, raging waves of tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions; that he has &s;poken, <HI>Peace be &s;till,</HI> and the &s;welling &s;ea of unruly tem|pers is hu&s;hed into a profound calm. So that now, you can no more delight in indulging your proud pa&s;&s;ions, and giving way to your bad tempers, than you can in gratifying your carnal lu&s;ts. Hence, as Paul &s;ays upon another occa&s;ion, "Others will wor&s;hip God, and report that God is in you of a truth:" that the God of peace and love is with you: that Chri&s;t is upon the throne of your heart; that he reigns in you, and rules over your evil tempers, and brings your unruly pa&s;&s;ions into captivity to the obedience of him&s;elf. Yea, to the honor and glory of our heavenly King, you will make it ma|nife&s;t, that his kingdom is not in the word of profe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="8" REF="7" MS="y">
but in the power of the Holy Gho&s;t. And that your tongue, which is naturally a fire of hell, and a world of iniquity, that defileth the whole body, &s;etteth on fire the cour&s;e of nature, and is &s;et on fire of hell, which is an unruly member, full of deadly poi&s;on, which no man can tame, James iii. 6, 8. yet Je&s;us, by the power of his go&s;pel, hath tamed and &s;ubdued. There|fore now, to the glory of your Saviour, the wild wolf can dwell with the tame Lamb; the &s;avage leopard, lie down with the harmle&s;s kid; the fierce lion, with the inoffen&s;ive calf; and a young child can lead tho&s;e tem|pers and pa&s;&s;ions of yours, which were heretofore un|governable and untractable. O what glory does this bring to the God of all grace! what honor to our dear Saviour's power and love! how does it adorn his glo|rious go&s;pel of peace! O, brethren, for our &s;ouls &s;ake, for our brethren in Chri&s;t's &s;ake, for the &s;ake of the honor of our God and Saviour, and for his go&s;pel's &s;ake, let us be all &s;trife and contention, who &s;hall get mo&s;t of the ornament of a meek and quiet &s;pirit from Chri&s;t, to live mo&s;t in it, and to glorify him mo&s;t by it. It is mo&s;t plea&s;ant to dwell on this. But it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to turn to the dark &s;ide of the que&s;tion, and con&s;ider,</P>
<P>2dly, The evil of indulging a contrary &s;pirit, and giving way to oppo&s;ite tempers. This will appear very injurious in a per&s;onal and relative point of view.</P>
<P N="1">1. Per&s;onal. It will be hurtful to our&s;elves. Do we con&s;ult the health of our bodies? Evil tempers and im|moderate pa&s;&s;ions, have a very injurious effect upon the frame of the body. How many have &s;acrificed their lives to a fit of anger? How many have lo&s;t their &s;en&s;es, others their health irrecoverably, in a fever of furious pa&s;&s;ion? Well might the heathens &s;tile a fit of anger, <HI>brevis furor,</HI> &s;hort madne&s;s. But my concern is not &s;o much about the walls of your hou&s;e, as for the good of the tenant which dwells within, your precious &s;oul.
<PB N="9" REF="8" MS="y">
My me&s;&s;age is chiefly to thee, O thou immortal part, born of God, and formed for the enjoyment of God. How do &s;inful anger and unbridled pa&s;&s;ions affect, wound, and di&s;tre&s;s thee! Say, Con&s;cience. Te&s;tify, thou faithful witne&s;s. How long &s;ince thou did&s;t feel the exaltings of devili&s;h pride, and hearde&s;t the loud clamors of haughty pa&s;&s;ions, venting their rage and fury to thy wounding and pain? Was it lately? This day? this hour? ju&s;t now? How do&s;t thou feel thy&s;elf after it?</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t attend to the evil effects this hath upon the <HI>con&s;cience.</HI> A chri&s;tian's con&s;cience, is that inward know|ledge it has of divine truths, and that te&s;timony it bears to the ble&s;&s;ed effects and holy influences which they have upon the &s;oul. By the knowledge of the law, the con|&s;cience is filled with a &s;en&s;e of wrath and condemnation; hence it becomes an evil con&s;cience; it bears te&s;timony of evil, guilt and wrath to the &s;oul. By the &s;prinkling of the blood of Chri&s;t upon the heart the con&s;cience is made a good one, Heb. x. 22. It knows and finds peace with God, pardon of &s;in, and ju&s;tification in his &s;ight; and it bears a good and comfortable te&s;timony to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Now the chri&s;tian is called to live under and main|tain con&s;tantly, the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience by the &s;prinkling of the blood of Chri&s;t; and to have the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience towards God, by the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from the dead, 1 Pet. iii. 21. But giv|ing way to, and indulging of any &s;pirit and temper, which is contrary to the purity and meekne&s;s of the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, will rack and torture the con&s;cience, wound and grieve it, di&s;turb its peace, and de&s;troy its comfort. Why? Becau&s;e there is a ce&s;&s;ation of the chri&s;tian's liv|ing by faith on Chri&s;t, cleaving to him, feeding upon him, and enjoying holy fellow&s;hip with him.</P>
<P>Can we &s;uppo&s;e, when we &s;ee a per&s;on violently agi|tated by a fit of pa&s;&s;ion, that he is at that moment living
<PB N="10" REF="9" MS="y">
under the influence of faith in Je&s;us, love to him, and peace with him? can we think that he then enjoys an inward calm, a &s;un&s;hine of peace of con&s;cience? No; we may as well &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;ea is in a profound calm when a &s;torm of wind blows. O ye fretful, pa&s;&s;ionate &s;ouls, who at every turn that thwarts your purpo&s;e, and oppo&s;es your inclination, fly into a rage of unruly pa&s;|&s;ion, how do you exalt folly! folly of the mo&s;t egregious kind: more &s;o, than if ye were to wound your fle&s;h with lancets; for ye wound your con&s;ciences, di&s;tract your minds, and di&s;tre&s;s your &s;ouls. You &s;acrifice your peace of con&s;cience, your comfort of mind, your joy of &s;oul in Je&s;us&mdash;for what? for the indulging a fit of rage, giving way to wrathful re&s;entment, and gratifying a devili&s;h pa&s;&s;ion. Hereby you make Chri&s;t's friends mourn, his ene|mies rejoice, the devils &s;port, and your&s;elves&mdash;what &s;hall I &s;ay? what compare you to? much wor&s;e than Solo|mon's madman, who "ca&s;teth firebrands, arrows, and death, and &s;aith, Am not I in &s;port," Prov. xxvi. 19. Sad &s;port! for hereby you deceive your own &s;oul, and rob your con&s;cience of &s;weet peace in Je&s;us, and heavenly joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. May the Lord &s;et this home upon my heart as well as yours! O may conviction fa&s;ten upon each of us for having thus exalted folly! may Je&s;us pardon what is pa&s;t, and &s;trengthen our &s;ouls to re&s;i&s;t and overcome this evil in future!</P>
<P>Suffer me here to drop a hint to your &s;ouls and mine. If after a fit of pa&s;&s;ion, and exalting any evil tempers, we do not find our con&s;cience wounded and pained, but &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing its courage and confidence; this is no good &s;ign. It argues a &s;tupidity of con&s;cience, and of its be|ing hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. For a tender con&s;cience will feel the evil, even of a ha&s;ty word &s;poken in a &s;pirit and temper incon&s;i&s;tent with the puri|ty and peace of the go&s;pel; the &s;oul will be humbled un|der
<PB N="11" REF="10" MS="y">
it, grieved for it, and have recour&s;e to the blood of Chri&s;t for the pardon of it. But by a long and habitual cour&s;e of giving way to evil tempers, and indulging &s;in|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> pa&s;&s;ions, a per&s;on may be &s;o blinded thereby as not to &s;ee the evil thereof, and &s;o hardened therein as not to feel the bad effects of them.</P>
<P>Hence, how many aim to ju&s;tify &s;uch conduct, &s;ay|ing, "Every man has his fault, and this is mine. True, I have bad tempers; I am of a pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition; they are natural to me; I cannot help it; they are &s;oon over; and I bear no malice." This is cur&s;ed rea&s;oning: quite op|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ite to the language of faith. To judge any ones &s;tate is not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">r province; but this we may &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ely &s;ay, men are to be known by their fruits. As &s;uch conduct, and &s;uch language are not the fruits of holy faith in Je&s;us, do not flow from love to him, therefore &s;adly evidence, that &s;uch a &s;oul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ither has not been convinced of the evil of &s;in by the Spirit of holine&s;s, or has lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of it from his con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">ence, that he is not living by the faith of the Son of God, and walking under the influence of his go&s;pel, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ore than a profane &s;wearer, or an open adulterer is. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">erefore he does not, cannot enjoy the te&s;timony of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;cience, that he plea&s;es God, feel the peace of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">his con&s;cience, the love of God &s;hed abroad in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">, and the Holy Spirit bearing witne&s;s with his &s;pi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> that he is a child of God.</P>
<P>If this addre&s;s &s;hould fall into the hands of any &s;uch e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ders, I dare appeal to them, whether this is not a true e&s;eription of their &s;tate; whether they do not walk in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">kne&s;s re&s;pecting the &s;tate of their &s;oul; and whether, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> times, they do not tremble in, uncertainty, fear|ig all will not go well with them at la&s;t; dread|ig le&s;t their precious &s;ouls &s;hould be rejected by Je&s;us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ith, <HI>Go ye cur&s;ed?</HI> O this is an awful &s;tate to live in! ut mo&s;t awful to die in!

<PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y">
pardon for it, and power over it. But to proceed. Con&s;ider, 2dly, The evil of &s;uch conduct, as it hinders our prayers. I do not mean, that it totally prevents our <HI>&s;ay|ing prayers</HI> (though it is to be feared it often has this effect al&s;o) but it hinders the &s;pirit of prayer. We may keep up the form, when the life and &s;pirit of prayer is quite evaporated. It is no unu&s;ual thing to have the form of prayer kept up in families, where the &s;pirit of violent pa&s;&s;ions and evil tempers reign in the heads of tho&s;e families. They will &s;ay prayers with their families at night, after they have lived in the &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion with them all the day. Yea, before they called them in to prayer, it was prefaced with a &s;torm, which only &s;ub&s;ided till the prayers were over, and then the &s;torm was as vio|lent as before. Surely &s;uch prayers, connected with &s;uch conduct, mu&s;t be an abomination to the Lord. O how are &s;ouls deceived herein, and their prayers hindred here|by! Says Paul, "I will that holy men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubt|ing," 1 Tim. ii. 8. But where there is wrath of &s;pirit, there will be doubting of heart, and hands cannot be lifted up to God with boldne&s;s, nor &s;ouls find freedom of acce&s;s to him. Where the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, quietne&s;s, and peace, does not reign in the tempers, the &s;pirit of prayer doth not live in the heart, nor can fervent effec|tual prayers a&s;cend from the lips. Therefore our Lord &s;ays, "In your patience po&s;&s;e&s;s ye your &s;ouls," Luke xxi. 19. "Be patient towards all men," 1 The&s;&s;. 5. 14. "Let not the &s;un go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil," Eph. iv. 27. from hence it plainly appears, that an impatient, pa&s;&s;ionate, wrathful man, is &s;o devili&s;h complai&s;ant, as to give place to the devil, to let him take the upper hand of him, by giving way to pa&s;&s;ions and tempers, which are agreeable to his proud and furious nature.

From hence we may conclude, he who lives and walks under the evil influence of them, has &s;atan for his com|panion all day; he that lies down under the power of them, has &s;atan for his bedfellow at night.

And, if the&s;e prevail over us, can we enjoy the comfort of faith, and the joy of hope within us? It is impo&s;&s;ible. Do we believe Chri&s;t hath &s;uffered for our &s;ins? Do we hope for &s;alva|tion through his &s;ufferings and death? What! and not &s;tudy to follow the example of his life, nor &s;trive to tread in his &s;teps? Let us be a&s;&s;ured, two more oppo&s;ite cha|racters cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, than a meek, lowly, patient Saviour, and a furious, proud, impatient di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, true faith leads the &s;oul to look for con&s;or|mity to the life of Chri&s;t, as well as expects &s;alvation from wrath by his death. The hope of &s;eeing Je&s;us in glory, purifies the heart from evil tempers, and the life from &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, even as Chri&s;t is pure; and in &s;uch, the comfort of faith and the joy of hope abounds. But where there is the &s;tri&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, and the fury of anger, there is confu&s;ion and every evil work. If the power of faith in Chri&s;t does not prevail over our &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, the peace of faith cannot rule in the heart. The joy of hope in Je&s;us cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, while the mind is
<PB N="14" REF="13">
agitated with the tumult of pa&s;&s;ion. The comfort of love will be bani&s;hed by anger and wrath. No marvel then, if our evil tempers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions have the a&s;cendency over us, that we have not joy and peace in believing within us. Do you complain for want of the comfort of faith, and the joy of hope? Look to your conduct. See if you do not, by the fury of your pa&s;&s;ions, and giving way to your evil tempers, grieve the Spirit, and drive that peaceful gue&s;t from your bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The fruit of righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;own in peace, of them who make peace, James iii. 18. But if you &s;ow to anger and pa&s;&s;ion, and war and &s;trife &s;pring up, you can reap nothing but the fruit of di&s;cord and dejection. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-&s;uffering, gen|tlene&s;s, meekne&s;s, &amp;c. and the works of the fle&s;h are manife&s;t, which are variance, emulation, wrath, &s;trife, &amp;c. Gal. v. xix. 22. Now &s;ee, whether you are of the Spirit, or of the fle&s;h. Which are you governed by and live under the influence of? what fruits do you bear and bring forth, in the general cour&s;e of your life, and tenor of your behavior? Are they &s;uch as are agreeable to faith and hope in our Lord? or, are they &s;uch as are de&s;tructive of the peace of faith, the joy of hope, and the comfort of love in him? But,</P>
<P>4thly, Indulging our unholy tempers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, will prevent our profiting by hearing of the go&s;pel of peace. What avails hearing a form of &s;ound words, if we are not ca&s;t into the mould of them, and receive not the impre&s;&s;ions of a peaceable &s;pirit from them? The go&s;pel preaches peace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from God to poor &s;inners. But we cannot receive this in the &s;pirit of peace, while our angry pa&s;&s;ions and evil tempers prevail over us. Though the &s;eed of the word be &s;own, it cannot take deep root, it will not &s;pring up, nor bear any fruit in a pa&s;&s;ionate brea&s;t, but will &s;oon be choaked by di&s;ordered tempers. If we live under the power of
<PB N="15" REF="14">
evil tempers and pa&s;&s;ions, though we may hear the go&s;|pel, like the go&s;pel, and delight to &s;et under the preaching of it; yet it will be with us, as it was with the people who &s;at under Ezekiel's mini&s;try. Saith the Lord, "They &s;it before thee as <HI>my people,</HI> and hear thy words, but they will not do them, for with their mouth they &s;hew much love, but their heart goeth after their &s;ins, and lo, thou art unto them, as a very lovely &s;ong of one that hath a plea&s;ant voice, and can play well on an in&s;trument: for they hear thy words, and do them not," Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32. Now here is a true picture of unprofitable hearers. They like, they &s;eem delighted with the &s;ound of the go&s;pel; it charms their pa&s;&s;ions into compo&s;ure, and their tempers into &s;erenity. How long? Till the &s;ound is pa&s;&s;ed from their ears, and their feet have reached their dwellings. There, in&s;tead of &s;triving to mix faith with the word, and ca&s;ting them&s;elves humbly down be|fore the Lord, to &s;teep the &s;eed of the word in meditation and prayer, alas! the birds of prey, &s;ome fierce pa&s;|&s;ions, &s;ome unruly tempers are exalted, which devour the &s;eed, and no profit is gained by it. Though &s;uch hear the word, "be at peace among your&s;elves," 1 The&s;&s;. v. 13. "Follow peace with all men," Heb. xii. 4. "Seek peace and en&s;ue it," 1 Pet iii. 11. Though peace flees from you, yet pur&s;ue and overtake it. Yet they do it not. But in&s;tead of this, every little thing calls up their pa&s;&s;ions to arms, and enrages their tempers, and they are &s;oon engaged in the war of commotion. They do not as exhorted, "receive with <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> the engrafted word, which is able to &s;ave the &s;oul: for if any man among you &s;eem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain," James i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">1. The Lord help us to &s;ee and feel the evil of thus giving way in the lea&s;t herein. O may we not be &s;uffered to be thus a &s;hame to the go&s;pel, but

may we find it to be the power of God, to the &s;alvation of us, from our unruly tempers and unholy pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But to proceed one &s;tep farther, to con&s;ider this evil in re&s;pect to others. We all &s;tand in &s;ome, though dif|ferent relations to each other in life. And we all may be, yea, certainly are, profitable or hurtful to each other, by the &s;pirit and temper of our behavior. We are prone to catch evil tempers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions from each other, and to provoke one another to wrath. We teach very powerfully by our examples. The tinder of pa&s;&s;ion &s;oon catches the falling &s;park, and kindles into a flame; for we all have the tinder of it in our nature. The &s;eeds of every evil temper and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ion are in us all, and are &s;oon brought forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o fruit by bad example. My own &s;oul is bowed down on account of pa&s;t bad conduct herein. O what an evil, what an in|jurious example do we &s;et our children, our &s;ervants, and all about us, by exciting a &s;pirit and temper contrary to the profe&s;&s;ion we make, of being di&s;ciples and follow|ers of the meek and lowly Je&s;us! This calls for great humblings of &s;oul before the Lord.</P>
<P>Fiery tempers, and impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, give others but a very indifferent opinion, either of the holy truths we profe&s;s, or of the reality of our belief of them. You cannot, you dare not, you will not, have a heart, with boldne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tency, to reprove a child, a &s;ervant, or a friend, for pa&s;&s;ionate tempers, and angry words, when you live and act under the influence of them your|&s;elves. They will gag your mouth, and &s;top your re|proof. If they do not, the natural reply to you may be, <HI>Phy&s;ician, heal thy&s;elf.</HI> O how does &s;uch an allowed evil, teach, confirm, and harden others in the &s;ame! What a reproach does it bring upon our holy profe&s;&s;ion! How does it cau&s;e the name of God and his doctrine to be bla&s;phemed! Is it not very natural for others taun|tingly to &s;ay, "See, here are your &s;aints of God! the&s;e

What &s;ort of a Saviour do they be|lieve in? The&s;e are the effects of &s;uch doctrines they adhere to."</P>
<P>O my brethren, have I not urged enough again&s;t this evil, fully to convince <HI>you</HI> of it? Sure I am I have &s;aid enough to make <HI>me</HI> a&s;hamed of ever giving way to evil tempers, and indulging &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, and to humble my &s;oul to the du&s;t before our Lord for them. Well might Paul put this cutting interrogation to us, What fruit had ye then in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things whereof ye are now a&s;hamed? And add this awful a&s;&s;ertion, "For the end of tho&s;e things is death," Rom vi. 21. But hath Je&s;us died to &s;ave us from death? Is the gift of God eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord? Is Chri&s;t able to &s;ave us to the uttermo&s;t from our evil tempers and pa&s;|&s;ions? What remains then but that we &s;tudy, &s;trive and pray, for the ma&s;tery over tho&s;e evil tempers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions which are in us, and which are prone to prevail over us.

<P>To point out &s;ome remedies again&s;t giving way to our evil empers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, was the la&s;t thing to be attended to. And,</P>
<P>1&s;t, Let us receive it as a fixed and certain truth (the Lord impre&s;s it deeply on our hearts!) that fiery pa&s;&s;ions proceed from cur&s;ed pride: that cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed pride was forged i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">f hell; and its mi&s;chievous &s;hape for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ed upon the devil's anvil.

who&s;e in&s;pection do you con&s;tantly act? You are a &s;inner, a mi&s;erable &s;inner, under the &s;entence of death, by the law of God for &s;in. You will &s;oon become &s;ordid du&s;t and ignoble a&s;hes. Du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t &s;halt thou return, is thy irrever&s;ible doom. Does haughty pride become the brea&s;t of &s;uch vile beings as we are? Should imperious airs, pa&s;&s;ionate &s;peeches, and wrathful tempers be exalted by us? What! and the&s;e too, in the &s;ight and pre&s;ence of the Lord our judge? O how ill becoming &s;uch a conduct! therefore, &s;tudy and pray ever to maintain upon your mind, a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of your own vilene&s;s and poverty, that you may live in humblene&s;s of mind and lowline&s;s of &s;pirit before the Lord. Yea, be con&s;tantly humbling your&s;elves under the mighty hand of God, becau&s;e you find and feel in you &s;uch tempers and pa&s;&s;ions which are contrary to the meek and lowly Spirit of your Lord, are incon&s;i&s;tent with your being a di&s;ciple and follower of him, and if indul|ged, will certainly prevent your peace of mind, comfort of heart, and joy of &s;oul in him; and therefore mu&s;t ab|&s;olutely be &s;ubdued by the power of his grace.</P>
<P>Beware, that you li&s;ten not to any plau&s;ible excu&s;es which &s;atan and your own corrupt nature may urge, in any wi&s;e to ju&s;tify your evil tempers and di&s;ordered pa&s;|&s;ions. Though, like Agag, they may come dre&s;&s;ed up delicately, yet, let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ur hearts be fixed, and our faces &s;et as a flint again&s;t them, not to &s;pare t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">em; but to hew them in pieces before the Lord: for they have often made our hearts comfortle&s;s. A rooted and abiding conviction of the evil of them, will prove a &s;trong anti|dote again&s;t them. Meekne&s;s of temper proceeds from lowline&s;s of mind; and lowline&s;s of mind from a con&s;tant &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of our extreme poverty and total vilene&s;s; and our con&s;tant need of, and dependence upon the riches of the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t "He who is &s;low to anger, is better than the mighty, and he who

ruleth his temper, than he who taketh a city," Prov. xvi. 32. Bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> than the mighty! How? He lets the peace of God rule in his heart, as exhorted," C. l. iii. 15. and the grace of Chri&s;t reigns over all the pride and pa&s;|&s;ion of his corrupt nature. Thus, while the proud heart is humbled, Je&s;us is exalted, and the &s;word of anger he beats into a plough&s;hare; and the &s;pear of wrath into a pruning hook. To know our&s;elves, is the greate&s;t know|ledge. To &s;ubdue our&s;elves, the greate&s;t conque&s;t. It is true wi&s;dom to avoid an evil, true patience to endure it, and true valour to conquer it. James gives mo&s;t pre|cious advice to us, "My beloved brethren, be &s;wift to hear, &s;low to &s;peak, &s;low to wrath," James i. 19. There|fore,</P>
<P>2dly, Watch over your &s;pirit and temper. It is the command of your Lord, WATCH. Why? Becau&s;e ye know not what hour the thief may come, Matt. xxiv. 42, 43. Con&s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> every evil temper, every di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ion, as a thief which comes to rob you of your &s;weet peace, heavenly comfort, and holy joy in your Lord. Watchfulne&s;s is like a &s;trong chai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> to a wild bea&s;t. Such are your furious tempers. Chain them down by watch|fulne&s;s, within due bounds. David well knew the evil of giving vent to his &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions. He was in a &s;weet watchful frame, when he &s;ays, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips," P&s;alm cxli. 3. "He regarded wi&s;dom's voice. He who is &s;oon angry dealeth fooli&s;hly," Prov. xiv. 17. Why are we &s;oon angry? Becau&s;e we are fo fooli&s;h as not to watch again&s;t it. It takes us by &s;urprize, and overcomes us unawares. Therefore, the &s;pirit of revelation, is con|&s;tantly exhorting us to watchfulne&s;s. The evil of pa&s;|&s;ion and the &s;infulne&s;s of anger are hereby prevented, and many comforts enjoyed. The duty is ours; prac|ti&s;e it. The power to perform it, and the ble&s;&s;ings con&s;e|quent

on it, are from the Lord: therefore, "Watch un|to prayer," 1 Pet. iv. 7.</P>
<P>3dly. Keep under your body, and bring it into &s;ubjec|tion. A pampered hor&s;e is unruly. Living high, adds fuel to the fire of the pa&s;&s;ions. Self-denial, like an en|gine, cools the fire of the tempers. Says our Lord, "If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s and follow me," Mat. xvi. 24. The more &s;elf-denial for Chri&s;t, the more enjoyment of Chri&s;t: the more Chri&s;t is enjoyed, the more conformity to the lowline&s;s of his mind, and meekne&s;s of his &s;pirit will prevail. If a general cannot conquer a place by &s;torm, he will guard every avenue, and &s;tarve out the inhabit|ants. So-act by the fle&s;h and its &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions. Tho' you cannot totally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;troy the old man, yet do not pam|per, but &s;tarve him, &s;o as to mortify and &s;ubdue his evil tempers. For "if ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live," Rom viii. 13. Live in the peace of God, the love of Chri&s;t, and the comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t. Again,</P>
<P>4thly, Let us ever con&s;ider our high &s;tate and glorious dignity. Are we believers in Chri&s;t? Then we are born again of the Spirit, are one with Chri&s;t, are heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chri&s;t. Hear what Paul &s;ays of us: "Ye are not in the fle&s;h, but in the Spirit," Rom. viii. 9. Not in the fle&s;h! How &s;o? Do we not carry about us a body of &s;in and death? Have we not all the corrupt affections, bea&s;tly lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, and devili&s;h pa&s;|&s;ions of the fle&s;h in us? Yes: but notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e are in us, yet we are not in the fle&s;h: not left in our old &s;inful &s;tate of the fle&s;h, nor under help<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s na|ture: but are in the Spirit; in a new &s;tate, wherein all grace abounds to us, and all fulne&s;s of grace is trea&s;ured up for us in Chri&s;t; yea, and every enemy conquered, and perfect victory obtained by him, in our nature,
<PB N="21" REF="20" MS="y">
and on our behalf; therefore; though we have no in|herent &s;tock of grace in our&s;elves, yet being united unto Chri&s;t, and having fellow&s;hip with him, we may, we ought, to be continually receiving out of his fulne&s;s, to &s;trengthen us to overcome our &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ub|due our evil tempers. A&s;&s;ert, then, your dignity. Live above your low, earthly, groveling pa&s;&s;ions. Be not a &s;lave to the u&s;urping tyranny of your evil tempers. Do they be&s;et you? Do they teaze you? Do they demand admi&s;&s;ion, claim indulgence, and plead for gratifica|tion? Di&s;mi&s;s them with an air of triumph. Di&s;patch them with, "Get ye to hell, from whence ye came, ye ba&s;e-born offspring of &s;in and &s;atan; ye are unworthy my attention. I am a &s;on of God, a companion of Je&s;us, an inhabitant of the Spirit. Je&s;us hath made me KING to reign over you, a PRIEST to &s;acrifice you unto God, and an heir of glory to reign eternally with God." What then? Attend and obey the voice of the Spirit. "Put on therefore as the ELECT of God (holy and be|loved) bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering: forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel again&s;t any: even as Chri&s;t forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye," Col. iii. 12, 13. O let Chri&s;t and his forgiving love dwell with you, and be the rule and influence of your &s;pirit, temper, and behavior.</P>
<P>My dear Chri&s;tian brethren, we live too low, and do not enough con&s;ider our high &s;tate of dignity in Chri&s;t. Hence we do not act like our&s;elves, but grovel in the kingdom of nature, give way to the pa&s;&s;ions thereof, when we &s;hould be &s;oaring to and living in the kingdom of Je&s;us, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e heavenly tempers for which we are new formed by his grace. "Therefore &s;tand fa&s;t in the faith, quit your&s;elves like men [men of God, born of his Spirit, and one with Chri&s;t]. Be &s;trong," 1 Cor. xvi. 13. Strong in the Lord Je&s;us, and in the
<PB N="22" REF="21" MS="y">
power of his might, &s;o &s;hall ye put to flight the army of the aliens, of evil tempers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions. The bat|tle is the Lord's. Victory is &s;ure: it &s;hall end in his glory, and i&s;&s;ue in our comfort. Therefore,</P>
<P>5thly, Do penance for them. Nay, don't &s;tart. I mean not to make an atonement (the thought is the highe&s;t arrogance) but to mortify our proud &s;pirits for them. U&s;e this very humbling expedient. It will greatly tend to bring down your high &s;tomach and lofty &s;pirit, to lay your honor in the du&s;t, and to break your proud heart in pieces. Take the apo&s;tle's advice, "Confe&s;s your faults one to another," James v. 16. When over|taken by pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;urpri&s;ed into anger, let your tongue confe&s;s your folly. Be not a&s;hamed to do it, even to your inferiors; yea, the more inferior any are to you, &s;o much the more good will you get by it; and &s;o much the more will it humble our proud &s;pirits for it. Saul, though a king, confe&s;&s;es to David, "Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly," 1 Sam. xxvi. 16. Thus freely and fully confe&s;s your folly to others. Do not extenuate, but magnify the evil of pa&s;&s;ion, the folly of anger, and the madne&s;s of wrath, and beg their prayers for you, that you may be healed. For it is indeed to play the fool, and to err exceedingly from the road of humility, the way of peace, and the path of comfort. To commit a fault, and to brave it out, is a double evil. To confe&s;s a fault with a good grace and an humble mind, is a victory gained over &s;a|tan and our proud &s;pirit. It will powerfully work upon our brethren's pa&s;&s;ions for us&punc; greatly conciliate their affec|tions to us, and excite their prayers in our behalf. And &s;ure I am, &s;uch humbling conduct mu&s;t be well-plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of our dear Lord, who loves to &s;ee his peo|ple &s;ubject one to another, and clothed with humility; for "he re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble," 1 Pet. v. 5.</P>

Though we &s;ee in our fle&s;h dwells no good thing: though every evil temper and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ion dwell there, yet we &s;ee Je&s;us ever lives be|fore the throne for us; he is both able and willing to &s;ubdue them under us, and to &s;ave us from the power of them. Though they abound in us daily, yet let us be daily looking to Chri&s;t, in whom all fulne&s;s of grace dwells for us; and the more we feel the abounding of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and tempers in us, &s;o much the more let us look to Chri&s;t for the &s;uperabounding of his grace to us. For this is his mo&s;t precious voice to us all through life, "Lock unto me, and be ye &s;aved," I&s;a. xlv. 22. And this is the &s;weet, precious, ble&s;&s;ed experience of every &s;uch looking &s;inner, "We all with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord," 2 Cor, iii. 18. When the eye of the &s;oul is taken off from Chri&s;t, anger rages and pa&s;&s;ions pre|vail. While the eye is fixed on him they &s;ub&s;ide, and we are changed into lowline&s;s of heart and meekne&s;s of &s;pirit. O this looking unto Je&s;us has an amazing effect on us; therefore is to be con&s;tantly practi&s;ed by us. Glory to God's rich grace, that we poor &s;inners have &s;uch a precious Saviour to look to! Lord Je&s;us help us to be ever looking unto thee for &s;alvation from all &s;in on earth, till we &s;ee thee, and are perfectly like thee in glory!</P>

2dly, Come unto Je&s;us. This is his loving invitation, <Q>"Come unto me, all ye"</Q>&mdash;All who? Is it all ye who are free from your galling tempers and di&s;ordered pa&s;|&s;ions? ye, who are never di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by them, or per|plexed with them? O no, but ALL YE who labor under them, are weary of them, and heavy laden with them. Then thou, even thou; and me, even me, fretful, ha&s;ty, and pa&s;&s;ionate, as our natural tempers and &s;pirits are, may come, ought to come, yea are commanded by Je&s;us, to come unto him. Go where and to whom we will be|&s;ide Je&s;us, and we &s;hall be like the poor woman who had &s;pent all that &s;he had upon phy&s;icians, but they proved of no value, for &s;he only grew wor&s;e. If we go to &s;elf-righ|teous proud Phari&s;ees, and tell our ca&s;e, they will &s;hake their heads at us, pronounce our ca&s;e de&s;perate, our &s;tate hopele&s;s, and loftily turn away from us. Go we to our affectionate, &s;ympathizing brethren in Chri&s;t, they may pity and pray for us, but they cannot heal us. But, O &s;weet compa&s;&s;ion of our loving, tender hearted Je&s;us, he &s;ays, "I WILL GIVE YOU REST." And at once to &s;i|lence every objection, and to revive every encouragement, our ever dear Lord adds, "I AM MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART." <HI>Meek</HI> to receive you without cruel upbraid|ings: <HI>lowly</HI> to teach you, without bitter reflections. "Come then unto me, and learn of me, and ye &s;hall find what ye can no where el&s;e obtain, REST UNTO YOUR SOULS," Matt xi. 28, 29. Re&s;t from turbulent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">empers and tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions, even the re&s;t of a lowly heart and a meek &s;pirit.

<P>3dly, Feed upon Je&s;us. For he &s;aith, "He who eateth me, even he &s;hall live by me," John vi 57. Our pa&s;&s;ions live, are mighty in us, and prey upon us, becau&s;e we are not feeding upon and living by Chri&s;t. Spiritual feeding on Chri&s;t in our hearts by faith, nouri&s;hes our graces and &s;trengthens our &s;ouls; while it kills our car|nal
<PB N="25" REF="24">
tempers, and &s;ubdues nature's pa&s;&s;ions. Feeding upon Chri&s;t's love to us, will make us grow up into him in love. Feeding upon his life, will nouri&s;h us up into conformity to his meek &s;pirit. Feeding upon his death, will mortify our old man with his tempers and pa&s;&s;ions. Feeding upon his &s;alvation, will make us &s;trong in his might, and conquerors over our evil tempers. Feeding upon his meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, long-&s;uffering, and kindne&s;s to us, will make us meek, gentle, long-&s;uffering and kind to others. Feeding upon his preci|ous promi&s;es, that he will be with us, and guide us all through life, will be our &s;trength and &s;upport in the hour of death, and will receive us to him&s;elf, to be with him in glory, will &s;o &s;wallow up our whole man, in the &s;weet peace, holy love, and heavenly joy of Chri&s;t, that we &s;hall be con&s;trained to cry out,</P>
<L>Let not a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ion dare</L>
<L>Di&s;turb my brea&s;t, my Lord is there.</L>
<P>O for keener appetites, thus to feed on Chri&s;t by faith, that we may &s;o live by him, as to glorify him, by the &s;oftne&s;s of our pa&s;&s;ions and the &s;weetne&s;s of our tempers on earth, till we come to live, reign with, and eternally enjoy our Saviour in glory.</P>
<P>4thly, Walk with Chri&s;t. It is a common ob&s;erva|tion, A man is known by the company he keeps. It is natural to us to catch their manners, &s;pirit and temper of behavior. This mo&s;t certainly will hold good, re|&s;pecting Chri&s;t and us. If we walk in clo&s;e fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t, we &s;hall be &s;ure to catch the fire of love from his heavenly flame, &s;weet peace from him, who is the pacific ocean, and meekne&s;s of &s;pirit from him, who is the gentle <HI>Lamb of God.</HI> I have often thought of poor Peter. O how much do I &s;ee of my own ca&s;e in his! "Peter followed Chri&s;t afar off," Matt. xxvi. 58. What
<PB N="26" REF="25">
was the con&s;equence? A very awful one. As he was afar off from the pre&s;ence of Je&s;us, &s;o was he al&s;o from his &s;pirit and temper. O what a rage of pa&s;&s;ionate mad|ne&s;s &s;eized him! Hear and tremble for your&s;elf. Be|hold (but not to take any licence from his example, or to ju&s;tify your&s;elf in any &s;uch practice) behold, the di&s;ciple of the meek and lowly Je&s;us cur&s;ing and &s;wear|ing like a Trooper. Well, Peter, if thou wa&s;t a&s;hamed of thy Lord, he had now much more cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of thee. See the dreadful effects of keeping at a di&s;|tance from Chri&s;t. As Peter did not keep clo&s;e to his Lord, his Lord left him to his pa&s;&s;ions, which brought a hell of horror into his con&s;cience; and he would have dropped into hell it&s;elf, if his Lord had not looked him by love, into repentance unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>O my brethren, to walk with and keep clo&s;e to Chri&s;t in heart, hope, and affection, is to live above our &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, and at a di&s;tance from our evil tempers. They cannot prevail over us, while Je&s;us is in company with us. What will con&s;titute our ble&s;&s;edne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in glory? The pre&s;ence of Je&s;us. This, this is our heaven upon earth now. This makes paradi&s;e in a world of woe. This brings heaven into our &s;oul, while it inhabits a body of &s;in. This &s;oothes our tempers, and charms our pa&s;&s;ions into a heavenly frame. Hence David, in the pa&s;&s;ion of love, and in the jealou&s;y of fear cries out, "For&s;ake me not, O my Lord: O God, be not far from me," P&s;alm xxxviii. 21. To walk clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, is to en|joy fellow&s;hip with God the Father, and this de&s;troys our fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, and &s;ubdues all the corrupt lu&s;ts and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions of our fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Again. Walk with Chri&s;t, and you &s;hall enjoy the comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t. He will come and dwell in us, and bear his ble&s;&s;ed witne&s;s to our &s;pir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, that we are the children of God.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
Con&s;ider well this precious text; "God hath exalted Je&s;us to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repen|tance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. Whereof the Holy Gho&s;t is a witne&s;s, whom God hath given to them who <HI>obey him,"</HI> Acts v. 31, 32. The whole glory of the Godhead, centers in the work of Je&s;us for us poor &s;inners. Though the Holy Gho&s;t at fir&s;t enlightens and convinces us, when in a &s;tate of enmity to God, and rebellion again&s;t Chri&s;t, and lead us to Chri&s;t for remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; yet afterwards we cannot enjoy his comforts, but as we are living in obedience to the will of God the Father. And this is his will, that we &s;hould con&s;tantly hear, be|lieve on, and walk in fellow&s;hip with his beloved Son, our Prince and our Saviour. To this ble&s;&s;ed end the Holy Gho&s;t bears witne&s;s of Chri&s;t in the word, and while we are thus living and walking with Chri&s;t in faith and love, we &s;hall experience victory over our &s;ins, Iu&s;ts, corruptions, evil tempers, and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions; and the Holy Gho&s;t will bear his comfortable witne&s;s in our hearts, of God the Father's love to us, and of God the Son's &s;alvation of us, and that we really are the children of God, by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Now here is the my&s;|tery of our mo&s;t holy faith, to the &s;ubduing of the my&s;tery of iniquity in us. There is no victory over &s;in, our|&s;elves, the world, and &s;atan, but in Chri&s;t. There is no enjoying remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, nor any comfort from the Holy Gho&s;t, but in obedience to God, in believing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ving, and walking with Je&s;us, our exalted Prince and Saviour. "Ye know that Chri&s;t was manife&s;ted to take away our &s;ins," 1 John iii. 5. Ble&s;&s;ed knowledge of the precious &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t <HI>for us.</HI> But this is not all. For "the Son of God was al&s;o manife&s;ted to de&s;troy the works of the devil <HI>in us,"</HI> ver. 8.

<PB N="28" REF="27" MS="y">
&s;in. For Chri&s;t is of God as much made <HI>&s;anctification</HI> to us, as <HI>redemption</HI> of us. Hence, &s;ays our Lord, "If ye love me, keep my commandments;" and then he pro|mi&s;es the COMFORTER to abide with us for ever, John xiv. 15, 16.</P>
<P>From what has been urged I draw this plain</P>
<P>INFERENCE.</P>
<P>The Lord impre&s;s the importance of it deeply upon all our hearts. It is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s. The go&s;pel of the grace of God, which brings &s;alvation to us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t ONLY, hath the mo&s;t genuine and powerful influence upon the whole man, to engage the affections, to purify the heart, to &s;ubdue the pa&s;&s;ions, to regulate the whole conduct, and to bring every thought, word and work into captivity to the obedience of Chri&s;t. Therefore, where-ever there is true, living faith on the Son of God, as the Saviour of &s;inners, that &s;oul will be daily com|ing to him in poverty of &s;pirit, feeding upon him in humblene&s;s of mind, and walking with him in lowline&s;s of hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, hungering and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, and looking to receive out of Chri&s;t's fulne&s;s grace upon grace. Hence I lay down, this &s;hort, but comprehen&s;ive view of a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ue believer in Chri&s;t. HE IS FRAMED BY GOD'S GRACE, AND FORMED FOR HIS GLORY. HE LIVES BY FAITH IN DIVINE TRUTHS, RELIES ON PRECIOUS PROMISES, AND WALKS IN OBEDIENCE TO HOLY COMMANDS. "As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy," Gal. vi. 16. I cannot conclude without adding the following</P>
<P>CAUTION.</P>
<P>Is it &s;o? Beware then, of that cur&s;ed, Antinomian, licentious, anti-evangelical &s;pirit, which &s;o &s;adly pre|vails in this day. Hence &s;o many profe&s;&s;ors re&s;t &s;ati&s;|fied with a mere notion of a &s;et of doctrines in their
<PB N="29" REF="28" MS="y">
heads, without experiencing the love of Chri&s;t in their hearts, and the power and influence of it over their lives, tempers and conver&s;ations. They talk very highly of the deep things of God, &s;hew great zeal for the doctrines of grace, and are warm in defending them again&s;t error. But, alas! they live very low. In&s;tead of &s;triving again&s;t &s;in, they make light of it: Exerci&s;ing no godly jealou&s;y over their tempers and pa&s;|&s;ions: are not following after holine&s;s, nor zealous of good works to plea&s;e the Lord. With all their head knowledge, they live under the influence of the &s;ame worldly &s;pirit, and covetous di&s;po&s;ition; and exalt the &s;ame proud tempers and &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions as others do, who are de&s;titute of &s;uch knowledge. Indeed they live as if they thought, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ent to &s;ome certain points of doctrine, that therefore they are indulged with a di&s;|pen&s;ation to &s;light and di&s;regard practical godline&s;s, and to look on it as the very e&s;&s;ence of <HI>legality.</HI> They walk as if they believed God looks on &s;in in them, and their neglect of obedience to the holy precepts and ex|hortations of the go&s;pel, with a more favorable eye than he does upon others. Hence, though they walk after the fle&s;h, and gratify the pride, plea&s;ures, lu&s;ts, tempers and pa&s;&s;ions of the fle&s;h, and do not bring forth the fruits of the Spirit; nor evidence in their lives the power and purity of the go&s;pel upon their hearts; yet, they are very confident of the &s;afety of their &s;tate now, and that all will go well with them at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t fatal deception! Mo&s;t dreadful delu&s;ion! O my brethren, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er remember, "the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is the power of God unto &s;alvation, to every one who believ|eth," Rom. i. 16. "It bringeth forth fruit in the heart and life of every one who hears it, and knows the grace of God in truth," Col. i. 6. The very end of our being married by faith to a ri&s;en Saviour, Paul declares is, that "we &s;hould bring forth fruit unto
<PB N="30" REF="29">
God," Rom. vii. 4. and &s;ays our Lord, "He who abideth in me, bringeth forth much fruit. And herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, &s;o ye &s;hall be [appear to be] my di&s;ciples," John xv. 5, 8. Judge now, where the love of &s;in prevails in the heart, and the power of &s;in in the life and tempers, can &s;uch profe&s;&s;ors be &s;aid to have received the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and to experience it to be the power of God unto &s;alvation? Where the fruits of the go&s;pel are not brought forth in the li&s;e, can the root of the go&s;pel be in &s;uch hearts? What rea&s;on has any one to conclude that he is married to Chri&s;t, by the faith of the operation of God, if he doth not bring forth the fruits of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to the glory of God? What rea&s;on has any one to think that he is a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s from his very heart he finds power from Chri&s;t, to hate all &s;in, &s;o as &s;tudiou&s;ly to &s;trive again&s;t it; and &s;o to love holine&s;s as con&s;tantly to follow after it? None at all. Why &s;hould any one think that he abides in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in him, if he has not the &s;ame mind in him which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t, even to walk as Chri&s;t al&s;o walked, in meckne&s;s of tem|per, lowline&s;s of heart, and obedience of life to the glory of God? No one could, if he did not deceive his own heart with a vain religion, and &s;ub&s;titute a dead fancy, an empty &s;peculation, for a living faith. "For wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?" James ii. 20. And he ob&s;erves in the 17th ver&s;e, "Faith, if it hath not works is dead, <HI>being alone."</HI> Mind that word <HI>alone.</HI> Such a dead faith, is de&s;titute of Chri&s;t in his grace, pre&s;ence and power; of the pardon, peace, and love of God; and of the &s;anctifying influ|ence, comforting and joyful te&s;timony of the Holy Gho&s;t. As it is alone in the head, it brings none of this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s into the heart; and therefore it produceth not
<PB N="31" REF="30">
the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, nor the works of holine&s;s in the life and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>O how many &s;uch vain men are there among&s;t us! How is &s;uch a dead faith taken up with and re&s;ted in by profe&s;&s;ors, without <HI>looking</HI> to Chri&s;t, who is the life of our &s;ouls, and the life of our graces: <HI>coming</HI> to Chri&s;t, who is our &s;alvation, to be daily &s;aved by him: <HI>feeding</HI> upon Chri&s;t, who is our bread of life, to be nouri&s;hed up unto eternal life; and <HI>walking</HI> with Chri&s;t, who is our &s;anctification, to receive out of his fulne&s;s every &s;upply of grace, to conform our &s;ouls into his image, and our lives unto his obedience; &s;o as to adorn his go&s;pel, and &s;hew forth his prai&s;es, who hath called us out of nature's darkne&s;s, into the marvellous light of his precious love and glorious &s;alvation? O the depths of &s;atan! How does he transform him&s;elf into an angel of light, &s;o as to deceive &s;ouls, to be content with the bare <HI>light</HI> of truth in the head, without enjoying the <HI>love</HI> of Chri&s;t in their hearts, and the influence of his go&s;pel upon their lives! But &s;uch there ever were, and &s;uch there now are in the vi&s;ible church, to the &s;candal of the go&s;pel, the di&s;honor of Chri&s;t, and the grief of his &s;aints. Such drew tears from the eyes of aged Paul. Says he, "Many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, who&s;e end is de&s;truction, who&s;e God is their belly, who&s;e glory is their &s;hame, who mind earthly things," Phil. ii. 18, 19.</P>
<P>O methinks I &s;ee the holy man of God, with a flame of burning zeal for his dear Lord's glory, and for the caution and comfort of his real members, crying out, "My beloved brethren in Chri&s;t, for your &s;ouls &s;ake take heed and beware, that you do not catch the &s;pirit and temper, and are not infected by the walk and conver&s;ation of the <HI>many</HI> who profe&s;s to believe in our dear Saviour, and to be followers of him; but by their lives

Gold is their idol: and their greate&s;t ambition is to get riches. What they ought to be mo&s;t a&s;hamed of, they glory mo&s;t in. Their &s;ouls are wholly &s;wallowed up in earthlythings; and their time in the pur&s;uit of the enjoyment of them. However they may flatter and deceive their &s;ouls for a &s;ea&s;on, with the ma&s;k of profe&s;&s;ion, it will &s;oon drop off, and their end will be de&s;truction.</P>
<P>My brethren, permit one, who through rich grace, has e&s;caped (as with the &s;kin of his teeth) this prevailing de|lu&s;ion, of re&s;ting in doctrinal notions, and empty &s;pecu|lations, to apprize you of the evil of this; and to warn you again&s;t the danger of &s;topping &s;hort of the experience of the life, love and power of the grace of Chri&s;t, and walking in fellow&s;hip with him. It is this will &s;et our &s;ouls free from low and legal bondage, and &s;ervile &s;lavery to our domineering tempers and lordly pa&s;&s;ions.

And this from the mo&s;t generous principles, the belief of the truth, the grace of God, and the love of Chri&s;t; and to the mo&s;t valuable ends, the glory of God, the honor of Chri&s;t, and the adorn|ing of his go&s;pel.

<P><PB N="33" REF="32" MS="y">
Con&s;ider, Hath God &s;o loved us, even when in our natural enmity to him, and rebellion again&s;t him, as to give his only begotten Son to redeem and &s;ave us? Hath he &s;o commended, &s;o &s;et forth his love towards us, that while we were his enemies and ungodly, Chri&s;t died for us? Doth the go&s;pel proclaim this to us? Hath God the Holy Spirit, when dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, quickened our &s;ouls to hear and believe this joyful news; and to come unto Chri&s;t for pre&s;ent pardon, peace, and ju&s;tifica|tion; and to enjoy the lively hope in him, of eternal life and glory with him? And do we expect &s;oon to be ab&s;ent from this body of &s;in and death, and to be for ever pre&s;ent with our Lord?
